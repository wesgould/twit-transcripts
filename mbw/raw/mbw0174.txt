[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.920]   with some great Mac people starting with in studio with me,
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.240]   Alex Lindsey of the Pixel Corp, Pixelcore.com,
[00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.320]   Pixelcore.tv for the podcasts.
[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.820]   Hello.
[00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:34.320]   Hello.
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.800]   Welcome, Alex.
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:35.600]   Good to see you.
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.920]   Always nice to have you in studio, also with us,
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.000]   from beautiful Massachusetts, where it's still legal to get
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.280]   married to anything you want.
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.600]   Mr. Andy and I go from the Chicago Sun times.
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.680]   Hey, Andy.
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.560]   We are the founders in the birthplace
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.600]   of the cradle of democracy.
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.040]   Our Constitution is the model upon which
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.360]   the United States Constitution and the world Constitution
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.000]   was fine written by none less than John Adams.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.120]   Therefore, we are God's authority on all moral issues.
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.400]   Hi.
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.120]   Nice to be here.
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.480]   Woo hoo.
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.480]   Woo hoo.
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.080]   And I'm really pleased to get a name that Annie Mac
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.200]   fan will know very well, John Gruber of daringfireball.net.
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.360]   He's from Philadelphia, where it's always sunny.
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.200]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.600]   And it's good to have you, John Gruber.
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.920]   Thanks for being here.
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.120]   It actually is sunny today.
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.880]   Are you in Philadelphia, Philadelphia?
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.600]   I am in Philadelphia, Philadelphia.
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.920]   I was born in New York.
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.600]   People say, well, people say they're from Philadelphia,
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.520]   and they usually mean Northeast to Philadelphia
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.480]   or Southwest to Philadelphia.
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.760]   Like I say, I'm from Pittsburgh, but I'm not from Pittsburgh.
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.160]   Yeah, but it's rampant with Philadelphia.
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.360]   And I've never been able to figure out why that is.
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.640]   Like, people who are half an hour drive away
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.840]   will say they're from Philadelphia.
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.280]   Yeah, people in Hatboro, Horsham,
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.120]   and they'll be in there from Philadelphia.
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.000]   Yeah, I never got that.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.120]   No, I'm right in Philadelphia.
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.600]   I think we're actually on a radio station in Hatboro,
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.440]   Horsham.
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.640]   There's a great breakfast.
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.960]   Yeah, there's a great breakfast place in Hatboro,
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.120]   Horsham, that's all I gotta say.
[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.000]   Big story today.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.600]   Actually, there's quite a few big stories today,
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.640]   but the story that's actually ongoing is Nexus 1,
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.600]   Google's phone, Google had the announcement today,
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.880]   I guess, to preempt CES, or maybe they didn't want to go
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.760]   to CES, but for whatever reason, if you go to google.com/phone,
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.720]   there is a phone there, a Google phone.
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.000]   Did we learn anything?
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.800]   Andy, you've been following the press conference, right?
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.160]   Anything coming out of it?
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.040]   Not really.
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.840]   Anybody who's been keeping their ear to the ground
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.080]   to engage in the sites that have gotten their hands on one,
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.000]   then there's no real news on the hardware.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.760]   The only real news is that Verizon will have their own
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.280]   in about a month or two, or excuse me,
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.760]   sometime in the next couple months of 2010.
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.440]   Otherwise, the really big news from the whole press conference
[00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.560]   is that it is going to be available out of contract,
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.520]   is gonna be sold directly through Google.
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.360]   You go to a page on Google, you have the option
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.920]   to be either buying it outright for about $550,
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.480]   in which case you just pop your own,
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.240]   so you can take your SIM card out of your iPhone
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.200]   and put it into the Google Android phone, excuse me,
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.880]   the Nexus phone, it'll work just fine.
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.360]   Or you can buy it at a discount if you're gonna sign up
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.320]   for one or two year contract, and they anticipate
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.280]   that most of the major carriers are gonna be covered,
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.400]   so this is gonna be a great switcher phone
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.960]   for lots of people, because they can simply
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:22.480]   complete the contract they are on right now,
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.680]   and not have to do a buyout, not have to worry about,
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.840]   well what happens if I, I'm getting great coverage
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.320]   with the provider I have right now,
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.800]   what happens if I switch to T-Mobile or somebody else?
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.680]   - It's interesting that they have Verizon on here
[00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.720]   as a radio button, not checkable, it says spring 2010,
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.960]   but then it says, "Droid does right below it."
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.720]   It's like, well, but you could still buy a droid.
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.080]   And then right below it, Vodafone, the European carrier.
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.800]   Now that's interesting, that means that HTC will make
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.080]   more than one handset, because the one that Engadget has
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.080]   and has seen it only had T-Mobile frequencies,
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.280]   so they'll have to be one with a chip for Verizon
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.400]   and presumably Vodafone.
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.120]   - It is curious too, I mean, and it's only
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.160]   a little bit over one year since the original G1
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.000]   HTC Android phone, and then just that one year,
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.840]   the one manufacturer HTC alone, I think worldwide,
[00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.840]   they've had like seven or eight Android phones.
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.520]   I mean, it's just in contrast with Apple and the iPhone,
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.200]   where it's one phone per year.
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.760]   And some of you can't even tell them apart.
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.440]   - Yeah, and also Google has made a point
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.720]   that this is gonna be just the first in a series of phones
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.720]   that are gonna be sold by the Google brand.
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.720]   So clearly Google is gonna be a serious challenger
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.360]   to iPhone now, not necessarily because they have
[00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.480]   a better phone, but because they are gonna--
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:39.960]   - They have better carriers.
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.840]   - Well, they're the only people who are in the position
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.080]   of selling it to anybody who has money
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.280]   and through any hardware manufacturer that wants to make one.
[00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.360]   - I, you know, somebody asked me,
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.240]   well, what's gonna be the story of this announcement?
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.000]   And to me, the only story or the only question was,
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.200]   is Google going to take a shot at cell phone carriers?
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.400]   Or is Google gonna take a shot at the iPhone?
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.680]   And it sounds like a ladder, not the former.
[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.400]   - Exactly, there's a lot of speculation that,
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.760]   well, why does Google need to sign up with any carriers?
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.320]   They're gonna have their own wireless network.
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:10.720]   They have bought their own frequencies
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.480]   and you're gonna be on the worldwide global Google network
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:14.320]   that costs you nothing.
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.160]   It's gonna be all supported via ads.
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.280]   And it turns out to be a very, very lowbrow sort of release.
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:23.600]   Even, I was sort of expecting with Android 2.1,
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.720]   this is the first Android 2.1 OS device
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.160]   that we'd see a lot of new software,
[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.480]   a lot of big tweaks to the user interface.
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:33.760]   And honestly, if you are an existing droid user, for instance,
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.520]   and you will seem very much to really lust after
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.040]   with the Nexus, the only thing, the only tweak
[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.960]   that they made that I like that I've seen so far
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.760]   is that they used to have a very, very complicated system
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:48.040]   of just overlaying drawers that you pull one drawer down
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:51.080]   and get notifications and then another drawer up to get,
[00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:54.320]   it's like a game of war, we're playing cards.
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.600]   So now they've changed that a little bit.
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.440]   Now the application drawer is now sort of an overlay layer.
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.360]   It's a little tweak, I'm a little bit disappointed
[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.080]   'cause I think they do need to start working
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.520]   on refining the user interface.
[00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.800]   But again, it's a step forward, anyway.
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:10.000]   - I think in the same way that the iTunes is really
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.600]   the killer app that makes the iPhone part much of what it is,
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.640]   I think that Google Voice is the thing that really makes
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.600]   these, a lot of these things, if they really tie that,
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.320]   wrap that tightly.
[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.640]   I know for you, for me, it's tempting,
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:25.720]   and I'm a pretty big iPhone user,
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.200]   is that I love, you know, we're getting ready to do more
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.440]   and more around Google Voice.
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:35.440]   And being able to kind of unhook from my phone number
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:37.200]   and be able to kind of virtualize that
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:39.120]   is something that I'm really interested in.
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.160]   - Yeah, and on top of everything else,
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.360]   they've added voice input as a standard input device.
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.240]   So anything that accepts any field,
[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:46.920]   any page that requires text input
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:49.000]   can now be inputted via voice.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:49.840]   - What does it have a voice?
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:51.160]   Does it have a recognition everywhere?
[00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:52.000]   - Voice recognition everywhere.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.120]   If you wanna tweet via voice, you can do that.
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:54.960]   - Oh, wow. - Wow.
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:57.120]   - Do you know, Andy, if the voice recognition
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:00.400]   requires online access, 'cause with like
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.560]   the Google search app for iPhone,
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:04.840]   it does voice recognition for your search query,
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:07.560]   but you've gotta be online 'cause it sends it
[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:10.600]   to the quote cloud and that's where it transcribes
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:12.080]   your voice and comes back.
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:14.600]   Or are they doing it all on the phone?
[00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.760]   - I know that the SDK does have support
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:18.520]   for onboard voice recognition.
[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:21.480]   It does require a lot of muscle from the server.
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:24.280]   Mostly it's, but the software that's on the server
[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:28.000]   is mostly understanding the context of a request.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.120]   It can figure out that it thinks that you've said
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:36.160]   barley bucket dodge, but only when a contest in Exisang,
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:37.720]   what the hell do you think he means?
[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:38.640]   You can say, how about he,
[00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:40.680]   how about he means Dayton bus schedule?
[00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:42.000]   Oh, okay.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.560]   Now that I think of it, that makes a lot more sense.
[00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:47.160]   So certainly I think the voice recognition
[00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.080]   will get a lot better with an internet connection
[00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:52.360]   without without, I don't actually have one in my hands now.
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.120]   When I was testing the Droid, one of the first things
[00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:55.840]   I was testing was, well, what happens if I turn off
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:59.960]   all the radios and then try to do voice,
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:02.480]   operate anything via voice, and some things work.
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:04.360]   Mostly it says, mostly though it is a feature
[00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.360]   for searching Google via voice,
[00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:08.240]   so that still remains to be seen for me.
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:11.240]   I have one question that maybe is obvious,
[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:13.040]   but I know that the one thing that I've been really thinking
[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:15.040]   about with the iPhone that I'd wanna see
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:17.040]   in the next version, there's been rumors that
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:20.160]   we're gonna see a new iOS for the iPhone,
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:23.840]   is it seems like when you're working on your iPhone
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.680]   and we have all these problems with being dropped,
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:27.760]   I'm in San Francisco, my office is in San Francisco
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:30.280]   and you get dropped all the time off AT&T,
[00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:32.720]   is that you want the phone rather than using Skype,
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:36.960]   'cause I use Skype in the office, from my iPhone.
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:39.560]   You want just the phone to know, hey, I'm on Wi-Fi,
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:41.760]   why don't I just voice this?
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.720]   Like Apple could almost build a routing to do that.
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.920]   Now, I think it's very hard to do for Apple,
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:50.920]   but I think it's not much less hard for Google to do it,
[00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:52.680]   because they've already got an infrastructure
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:54.360]   to allow that to happen, where it just decides,
[00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.480]   oh, I'm on Wi-Fi now, I'm gonna connect through Wi-Fi
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:59.880]   rather than my 3G, and then I'm not using my minutes,
[00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:01.200]   et cetera, et cetera.
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.480]   - Yeah, and I've thought about the same thing too,
[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:06.720]   'cause the times that I have the most problems with,
[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:09.600]   and Philadelphia is far better AT&T story
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:12.380]   than New York or San Francisco, but it's not good.
[00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:15.640]   But the times of the day when my iPhone
[00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:18.800]   and I have the most problems is weekdays during the day,
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:21.080]   I mean, that's the busy time.
[00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:23.880]   But that's also the time when I'm most likely to be
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:27.080]   in the house with a decent Wi-Fi network right here.
[00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:29.200]   So some kind of auto detection of,
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.400]   hey, I'm on a known Wi-Fi network,
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:34.580]   why not put the call over VoIP as a,
[00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:38.760]   somehow make it happen, magical technology.
[00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:39.680]   - Well, here's the question.
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:41.800]   Now, if your T-Mobile might allow that,
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:44.240]   but Verizon sure is not gonna allow that.
[00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:45.600]   So do you have a different--
[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.520]   - Because you're using it instead of the minutes,
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:49.320]   'cause you always charge for minutes on weekdays,
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:50.760]   and that's when I would need it the most.
[00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:54.880]   - Right, so are we gonna have different builds of,
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:56.360]   I don't think we're gonna have different builds of Google.
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:57.880]   I think this is a Google reference phone,
[00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:59.480]   they call it the Google experience.
[00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.080]   - Well, they have a lot less leverage.
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:04.520]   These phone manufacturers have a lot less leverage
[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:05.360]   when you don't--
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:06.200]   - Yeah, you want the phone?
[00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:07.480]   - When you're buying the phone, when you're buying the phone
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:08.840]   separately.
[00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:11.040]   - Well, you can't, but I have to say on a CDMA network
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:14.640]   like Verizon, you, I don't know how they're gonna do that
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.840]   because you have to have Verizon activated.
[00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:17.680]   It's not a sim card.
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:19.080]   - It's gotta be a second phone, right?
[00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:19.920]   I mean, it's gotta be--
[00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:21.160]   - Well, no, there are chips that can do both.
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.280]   There are chips that we had that I was correct about.
[00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:24.760]   - Verizon has sims.
[00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:27.400]   - No, there are chips that, there are phone chips.
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:29.880]   - No, no, in fact, I was mistaken.
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:32.240]   According to Ken Shebertson, he's given us a link
[00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:33.560]   to the Google page that says,
[00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:38.560]   "In excess ones antenna supports four GSM radio frequencies,
[00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:40.760]   eight, 15, 900, 1800, 1900,
[00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:43.840]   and three 3G bands, one, four, and eight.
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:45.600]   But it doesn't say anything about CDMA.
[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.360]   So I don't know how they're gonna do a Verizon phone.
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:48.680]   - Are they listing Verizon as one of their,
[00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:49.520]   I thought it was--
[00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:51.040]   - They say 2010, so they're gonna have to make
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:54.280]   a special Verizon version that CDMA,
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:56.160]   that won't use a sim chip,
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.120]   that will require Verizon activation.
[00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:00.280]   I don't think they can sell an unlocked phone
[00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:02.600]   that's Verizon compatible, is what I'm saying.
[00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:05.200]   - Well, right.
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.440]   - The technology exists to do it.
[00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:07.440]   I don't know whether they're doing it.
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:12.040]   There are cell chips that can cross almost all the--
[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:13.000]   - But how do you activate it?
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.520]   You have to call Verizon and they say,
[00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:16.240]   well, what are you talking about?
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:17.840]   - Well, yeah, it could be.
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:19.680]   - The only way you could activate it
[00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:23.840]   is if you had a friendly independent retailer
[00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:26.280]   who was willing to, I've seen that happen,
[00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:29.040]   they can activate CDMA phones 'cause there's a code.
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:31.000]   But generally, I would guess,
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.920]   be my strong guess that the Verizon version of this,
[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:35.360]   which will be a separate version,
[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:37.560]   will require you to buy it through Verizon.
[00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:38.400]   - Which is actually one of the--
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:39.240]   - That will not be an unlocked Verizon.
[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:40.600]   - By the way, this is one of the other,
[00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:42.480]   the arguments against having a Verizon account
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:44.440]   is that when you go overseas--
[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:46.200]   - You can't take it.
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:49.200]   They make one or two international Verizon phones.
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.160]   Maybe this'll be some sort of weird hype.
[00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:53.360]   - Well, Verizon does have coverage
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:54.840]   in a lot of different world countries.
[00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:56.720]   I was talking to Verizon about this issue
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:59.760]   when I was reviewing the Droid and they told me,
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:04.760]   I was using my Asia trip, my Mac Bania 9 trip as an example.
[00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:07.600]   And she said, well, in the three cities that you were in
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:10.640]   in Korea, China and Japan, we would have been able
[00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:12.920]   to give you coverage through a local partner.
[00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:16.520]   - And I was actually using a Verizon storm in Brazil
[00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:17.640]   when I was there.
[00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:19.720]   - Well, as I said, there are international phones
[00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:20.880]   also from Verizon.
[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:23.560]   They are GSM, hybrid GSM CDMA.
[00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:26.720]   But I'm gonna guess, I don't see it being,
[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:28.560]   I don't see it being an unlocked phone
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:30.360]   on the Verizon network, which is interesting.
[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:33.040]   I mean, really, this is to answer my initial question.
[00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:35.800]   This is not a shot across the bars of the cell carriers,
[00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:37.160]   by any means.
[00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:38.400]   - Well, I think that the shot across the bell
[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:40.280]   could come this little hybrid, you know,
[00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:41.680]   could turn into a lot more.
[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:43.760]   If you figured out how to switch from, you know,
[00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:46.280]   from your cell network to your wifi to your,
[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:47.440]   you know, so on and so forth, you know.
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:49.640]   - They're not gonna do, I can guarantee you.
[00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:51.800]   They're not gonna allow that on a Verizon phone.
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:53.520]   - I don't know if they're not allowed on a Verizon phone.
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:55.640]   I think that the issue, you know, for me,
[00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:58.200]   I think that AT&T could get a lot of heat off
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:02.600]   of their system if they allowed the wifi connection,
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:04.360]   you know, through that system.
[00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:06.840]   - I did talk to a major wireless carrier about that.
[00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:10.280]   And they said that in addition to any commercial reasons
[00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:11.480]   why they would not like to do that,
[00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:13.240]   which he did not want to even discuss,
[00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:15.360]   he said that they have teams of lawyers
[00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:17.200]   that have to really look into,
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:19.280]   because they're defined by the government,
[00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:21.000]   you know, as a telecommunications company,
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.800]   are they legally allowed to put calls
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:25.040]   across a wifi network?
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:27.120]   Or would they have to simply say that they are,
[00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:28.200]   there are different rules for calls
[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.720]   that get routed across wifi
[00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:31.480]   and different stricter rules that get routed
[00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:33.800]   across their traditional network.
[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:35.560]   - But I can say what's not really AT&T is,
[00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:37.480]   it's Apple just putting a switch in there
[00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:39.120]   that makes it happen.
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:42.240]   - Well, it would have to be,
[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:45.240]   it's a much more complicated situation
[00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:48.720]   than a simple technical switch that has to go in.
[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:51.600]   For instance, what happens if there's a 911 call?
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:54.640]   Does it, is there, have they sort of made a promise
[00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:57.520]   to the user that because I put a call through via wifi,
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:59.880]   I didn't tell you that you don't have coverage in this area,
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:02.920]   now there's a 911, are we not gonna be,
[00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:04.360]   this would be the carrier saying,
[00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:07.480]   are we now required to make sure that we can turn on your GPS
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:09.920]   to get a location to 911 dispatch?
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:11.720]   There, it was one of those conversations
[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:15.120]   that started with me making furious notes to my,
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:16.960]   so that I could start to refer some of these things
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:18.120]   to my legal experts.
[00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:19.520]   Then my eyes getting a little bit blurry
[00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:21.200]   and I wanted to get a soda.
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:22.040]   (laughing)
[00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:24.760]   But it did leave, it did leave me with the conclusion
[00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:26.880]   that it was one of those interesting concepts where,
[00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:28.640]   yes, we have the technology, yes, the software
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:32.080]   is very, very easy, but because in 1911,
[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:34.080]   new regulations were put into control,
[00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:36.080]   what can be done with telegraph operators,
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:38.840]   that's, there's a legacy law that would make things
[00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:41.160]   not difficult to do, but it would be something
[00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:43.760]   that has to be looked at before it can go through.
[00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:47.360]   - So if I click will, this phone work with my SIM,
[00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:53.200]   it says, "We are working hard to provide Nexus One phones,
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:56.800]   optimized for the Verizon network, please stay tuned.
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:01.040]   The Nexus One for Verizon will not be a GSM device,
[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:03.680]   so it will not be compatible with T-Mobile,
[00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:06.680]   AT&T or other GSM networks.
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:11.680]   The 3G band used by AT&T and Rogers, not supported.
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:14.520]   - Right, but it does work on Edge.
[00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:17.160]   - It works on Edge on AT&T, but not 3G.
[00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:20.080]   - Right, so you could use, so, but that's really not a very
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:24.320]   compelling pitch for an iPhone user who wants to switch.
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:25.120]   - No, not really.
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:26.880]   - Not the pitch to switch.
[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:29.400]   So again, I don't even know if it's a shot against
[00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:33.760]   the iPhone so much, it's just, what is Google,
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:36.360]   we'll wrap this up in a second, but what is Google's
[00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:38.200]   motivation, what are they getting out of doing this,
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:40.000]   why do they do this, Alex?
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.240]   - I think it gives them, I think it, you know,
[00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:44.760]   there was a great article, and I don't remember where I,
[00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:46.240]   so we were talking about it on TWIM yesterday,
[00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:48.760]   but it, you know, Google looks at everything as,
[00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:50.960]   can we dominate it or commoditize it?
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:52.400]   You know, that's what their argument was,
[00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:54.880]   is that everything that they do, everything that they add,
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:57.560]   either is dominant, is gonna dominate a market,
[00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:59.160]   or it's gonna commoditize the market,
[00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:01.640]   and it's gonna continue to allow them to do ads.
[00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:05.200]   I think location-based, location-based communication
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:08.240]   is going to be a massive thing for the next decade,
[00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:09.680]   and I think that Google has to have,
[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:12.920]   I think Google's learning, I think Google has learned,
[00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:15.320]   some of Apple's little tricks, which is that when you own
[00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:18.680]   the heart, you have to have some control over the hardware
[00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:21.040]   to get, you know, to keep on pushing the technology
[00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:22.560]   in the direction that you want.
[00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:26.040]   - Well, look, you can get it personalized.
[00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:28.400]   - Yeah, I'll see, that's one of the things that disappointed me,
[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:30.920]   because the sample hardware that they've been setting out
[00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:32.640]   with their employees as their,
[00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:34.880]   as their either-owned dog food test base,
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:37.280]   had a QC code on the back of it.
[00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:39.960]   It just has, it had the Google Android, you know,
[00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:43.840]   the logo, a little mascot holding up like a big QC code,
[00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:45.320]   and that, at first, I thought to me,
[00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:47.520]   that is a brilliant and simple idea.
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:51.400]   If you still screen a unique QC code for every single phone,
[00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:54.280]   you have the ability to simply hold up that phone
[00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:57.720]   to a kiosk device, to hold that phone up to like a check-in device,
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:00.040]   and instantly identify yourself by your phone
[00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:01.480]   without any need for Bluetooth,
[00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:05.040]   without any need to like transmit any cookies, any logins.
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:07.040]   You know, if we're gonna have a one-pass system
[00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:09.760]   for the real world, that's a brilliant way to do it.
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:11.640]   I was kind of disappointed to see these sample phones
[00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:14.400]   that were shown front and back during the keynote,
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:15.480]   saying that no, that's just,
[00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:17.760]   that was just a funny thing that we decided to do.
[00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:19.960]   - 'Cause it would even work with a dead battery.
[00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:21.200]   - Exactly. - Wow.
[00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:22.240]   - Right? - I mean, which is,
[00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:24.960]   you know, a legitimate problem with all smartphones.
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:26.280]   I mean, I don't know what the battery life
[00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:27.440]   exactly is gonna be on this, but--
[00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:29.800]   - So, John, why does Google do this?
[00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:32.160]   Given what they've done, what's the point?
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:33.840]   - I don't know, the only thing I can think of that,
[00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:37.440]   it's the one thing I take away from this
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:39.440]   is that they're definitely emphasizing
[00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:43.080]   a hardware variety.
[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.320]   I mean, especially the fact that this has come so close
[00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:48.720]   on the heels of the Motorola Droid,
[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:53.720]   which was the, you know, the premiere Android handset
[00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:56.760]   in the world, but only for what now, five weeks.
[00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:58.360]   I mean-- - Right.
[00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:00.720]   - And now it's different because it's a different carrier
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:03.680]   and there are differences, like the big one
[00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:05.920]   being the hardware keyboard.
[00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:08.240]   But that to me is almost exactly the point, though,
[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:11.160]   is I guess Google's a, you know, doing this
[00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:14.360]   right on the heels of Droid, it's a way of emphasizing
[00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:16.080]   we've got a variety of hardware.
[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:19.640]   - Well, but isn't this, can't that become their Achilles heel?
[00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:22.360]   - I don't know, it'd be interesting to see how that plays out
[00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:24.840]   because I think for developers, it's definitely,
[00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:26.560]   you know, it's definitely a hassle.
[00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:29.160]   - I have no interest, I mean, someone asked me about,
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:31.200]   'cause we're developing a bunch of internal apps
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:35.080]   for the iPhone and I don't know if we're ever gonna release
[00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:37.240]   anywhere, we're just using them for stuff we need on our own.
[00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:40.920]   And I'm not interested in developing for the Droid
[00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:42.320]   because I'm like, there's too many interfaces.
[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:44.880]   I just, you know, I'd have to issue everybody a phone.
[00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:47.720]   You know, the phone that I wanna develop for,
[00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:49.480]   rather than just if I develop it on the iPhone,
[00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:50.880]   I know that I can just, you know, everybody,
[00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:52.040]   everybody in the office has got an iPhone,
[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:54.040]   so I don't have to worry about it.
[00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:55.520]   - One other thing before we get off it
[00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:57.960]   that I have thought about too, is when,
[00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:01.360]   I seem to recall when Android was initially announced,
[00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:04.200]   maybe it was just a year before they actually released a phone,
[00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:05.320]   but when they Google first said,
[00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:07.400]   look, we're gonna do this thing called Android,
[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:09.160]   it's gonna be an open source operating system
[00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:10.240]   for mobile phones.
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:12.720]   I remember at the debut, they talked about
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:14.400]   all sorts of different form factors.
[00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:16.760]   I mean, like, what do you call the cheap phones,
[00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:19.080]   feature phones, you know, with tiny little screens
[00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:21.280]   that you'd be able to use Android on them
[00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:22.280]   and on this, on that.
[00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:23.960]   And I think one thing that's come out of this,
[00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:26.800]   the way it's shaken out in the last two or three years,
[00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:29.760]   is that the iPhone has sort of defined
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:31.880]   the shape of a modern phone.
[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:33.760]   I mean, and you can argue about whether, you know,
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:37.320]   things like the hardware keyboard on the Palm pre
[00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:39.680]   and the PIXI and the Droid,
[00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:43.600]   but fundamentally, it's the biggest touch screen
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:47.280]   you can fit on the device and do as much as you can
[00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:49.080]   with touch UI gestures.
[00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:49.960]   - You're really right.
[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:52.120]   It looks like an iPhone, doesn't it?
[00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:52.960]   - Yep.
[00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:54.960]   - Right, compared to everything that came before the iPhone,
[00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:58.720]   everything now is like sort of fundamentally iPhone shape.
[00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:01.280]   - The form factor is now set in stone,
[00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:02.960]   or at least until the tablet comes out.
[00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:05.880]   - Have you seen the tap, I'm sorry, if I don't start the tablet yet.
[00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:06.880]   - Okay.
[00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:11.560]   - Don't, don't, zip it, zip, zip.
[00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:12.840]   We're gonna get to the tablet in just a bit,
[00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:15.040]   and John wrote a great piece on daring fireball
[00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:17.160]   about his predictions.
[00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:19.320]   In fact, the imperative that the tablet presents,
[00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:22.320]   and I think we're gonna talk about that.
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:24.040]   One last question.
[00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:25.600]   Anybody here order an excess one?
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:29.040]   Okay, just twist, just checking.
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:29.920]   - Thinking about it though.
[00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:30.760]   - I already couldn't.
[00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:32.800]   - Oh, John, now would you switch from an iPhone?
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:36.600]   - I would like to switch, you know, at least for a month,
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:38.600]   you know, and I guess worst case scenario,
[00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:42.520]   you know, if I don't really like it or think it's worth keeping,
[00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:45.160]   hopefully it'll have some kind of resale value.
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:47.520]   My other hope though is maybe with all these free ones
[00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:49.120]   that Google has given onto Google employees,
[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:50.480]   maybe it's probably one of them.
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:52.040]   - Not to like to get a free one, yeah.
[00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:55.160]   - Right, or maybe I could buy one from someone at Google
[00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:56.480]   or on eBay or something.
[00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:57.320]   - It's a good point.
[00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:59.040]   - Presumably they were told to keep them secret.
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:00.720]   - So wanna buy my droid?
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:02.760]   'Cause I just bought an excess one.
[00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:04.880]   - I mean, that is one difference between,
[00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:07.160]   it's one big difference between Google and Apple.
[00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:10.360]   Is Google seems pretty liberal with the free Google phones?
[00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:11.200]   - It's true.
[00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:12.840]   - Like everybody at the event today apparently got one,
[00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:14.760]   all the press over there, everybody gets it.
[00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:16.400]   Like imagine if Apple did that.
[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:18.680]   - Yeah, no kidding, you'd have a happy press score,
[00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:19.640]   that's for sure.
[00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:20.880]   Apple doesn't need to do that.
[00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:22.280]   Hey, there is another difference.
[00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:24.840]   Look how much we knew and how accurate our information was
[00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:28.240]   about the Nexus one compared to what we know
[00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:30.240]   about anything Apple does.
[00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:31.080]   - Yeah.
[00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:34.520]   - Well, that's because that's what happens when you basically,
[00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:37.360]   when you sort of force feed fire hose,
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:40.000]   actual production hardware into the field.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.840]   That's not a secret, that's more of a,
[00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:45.320]   we wanna find out, we're making up our slide deck,
[00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:46.920]   we wanna know what everybody's complaining about
[00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:49.360]   so we can tell them they're full of doubt.
[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:50.200]   - Well, that's one way to do it,
[00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:53.760]   but it is a completely different attitude and strategy.
[00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:57.600]   And I'd have to say, if you're saying open versus proprietary,
[00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:00.280]   it is a more open way of approaching the whole thing.
[00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:01.680]   - You have a lot of guesswork that goes on.
[00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:03.360]   I mean, there's a lot of guesswork for both of them.
[00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:05.520]   I mean, both of them are creating revolutionary,
[00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:06.520]   you know, hardware right now.
[00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:08.360]   - I'm just glad there's fricking competition.
[00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:09.200]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:10.320]   - And Palm really died on the vine.
[00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:13.160]   You know, Palm just did not do what it needed to do.
[00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:14.960]   And thank goodness there's somebody.
[00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:16.320]   - Are they gonna not dead yet, but boy,
[00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:18.680]   this doesn't, it's not boating well for the ground.
[00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:19.920]   - Yeah, crowd it up too much.
[00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:23.320]   - I think that definitely they are becoming the two leaders.
[00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:25.000]   I mean, I think Blackberry has,
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.280]   - Yeah, I'd be worried about a rim.
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:28.280]   - I think it's that government-
[00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:29.200]   - It's got government-incorporated inertia.
[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:30.040]   - Yeah, but I mean-
[00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:33.000]   - Those are the blackouts are kind of a scary thing for them.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.400]   But I think that they have some inertia,
[00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:37.680]   but I don't think that they have any momentum.
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:39.440]   - If this were the Google phone show, which it's not,
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:41.000]   I would then now ask the question,
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.240]   what does Google need to do to make that Nexus one,
[00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:45.120]   a credible Blackberry killer,
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:47.680]   but that will save for this week in Google.
[00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:50.240]   'Cause that's a very interesting topic.
[00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:52.440]   You know, what do you do to put Blackberry out of it?
[00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:54.400]   What rim out of its misery?
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:55.640]   But I do want to get to the slate
[00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:57.520]   or whatever the hell it's called.
[00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:59.640]   That's a crappy name, can't be the isolate.
[00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:00.920]   - I vote no on that.
[00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:02.600]   I'll go on the record. - Yeah, me too.
[00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:03.560]   - Crappy name.
[00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:06.840]   - And the only evidence of it is that Apple registered
[00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:09.320]   a trademark for it and a domain name for it.
[00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:10.160]   I mean, I can't help but-
[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:11.000]   - You register everything.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.760]   - That Apple's got 50 I-something domain names
[00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:14.960]   and trademarks.
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:17.440]   - They've got it so you can't, basically.
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:20.680]   We're gonna get to that topic and more.
[00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:23.200]   I'm so glad John Groobers here from DaringFireball.net,
[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:26.360]   really one of the most incisive observers
[00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:27.680]   of the Apple scene.
[00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:29.000]   He's just, you gotta read it.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.160]   He's just right on every time.
[00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:32.640]   And that's really the reason I wanted to-
[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:33.840]   - No, I just love your stuff.
[00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:35.240]   And a Serbik.
[00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:37.840]   And sometimes, yes, cranky.
[00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:40.120]   But we like that. - We like that in a commentator.
[00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:41.120]   (laughs)
[00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:41.960]   That's all.
[00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:43.920]   Most of the people on here are cranky from time to time.
[00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:45.360]   (laughs)
[00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:47.040]   Alex Lindsey for the Pixel Core also here
[00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:49.440]   and of course, my good buddy Andy Anaco
[00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:51.320]   from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:52.400]   Scott Bourne out for the day,
[00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:54.480]   but he'll be back next week.
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:56.120]   Do you want to mention our friends that go to meeting?
[00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:59.080]   Go to meeting is of course the software from Citrix
[00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:04.160]   that helps you travel less, get more done.
[00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:06.840]   And as you watch and listen to our live coverage of CES this week,
[00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:08.160]   you know that in many ways,
[00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:11.600]   you can be there in Vegas without having to travel
[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:13.680]   all the way there.
[00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:15.280]   - We make it- - We make it automatic.
[00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:18.920]   Yeah, you know, that's what Go to Meetings all about.
[00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:20.320]   You could be there at your meetings
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:21.920]   without having to travel to them.
[00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:23.880]   The internet, what a concept.
[00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:25.080]   Saves you time, saves you money,
[00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:27.000]   helps you get more done for sales presentations,
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.720]   for product demos.
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:30.560]   We use them to collaborate all the time.
[00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:33.240]   In fact, we use it on the show for people's show screenshots.
[00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:34.880]   I've used it to even do things like
[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:38.200]   rehearse presentations with somebody who's in Chicago.
[00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:40.720]   Training sessions, it goes on and on, it's easy.
[00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:44.280]   It's secure, 128-bit SSL, completely secure.
[00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:46.480]   No configuration of the router, the firewall,
[00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:48.280]   it just does net traversal automatically
[00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:51.960]   and at $49 a month for as many meetings as you want,
[00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:55.640]   as long as you want, there is no better deal out there.
[00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:58.240]   All of our coverage of CES 2010 is brought to you
[00:25:58.240 --> 00:25:59.640]   by my good friends at Citrix.
[00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:02.000]   We thank them so much for their support.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.520]   We're about to head to CES tomorrow for our four days of hell.
[00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:09.600]   I wish we could do the whole thing via Go to Meeting.
[00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:11.240]   Go to meeting.com/macbreak,
[00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:13.320]   that's the place to go to get your free trial.
[00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:15.600]   For the next 30 days, no cost to you,
[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:17.320]   you could see just what it can do for you.
[00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:21.920]   Go to meeting.com/macbreak, please try it free on me.
[00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:23.680]   I think you'll love it.
[00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:26.720]   So if you read Daring Fireball,
[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:29.880]   you probably read a really great piece by John Gruber
[00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:33.280]   on what Apple has to do to make this tablet succeed.
[00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:36.840]   In fact, great minds think alike because Andy Inaco
[00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:40.360]   in the Chicago Sun Times writing a very similar piece.
[00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:41.360]   And I'd like to say--
[00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:42.880]   - Especially something.
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:45.720]   - Well, I'd like to say that as soon as I read Gruber's piece,
[00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:49.840]   I too was amazingly coincidentally
[00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:52.440]   of the same exact opinion.
[00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:54.200]   So John, you want to summarize
[00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:56.960]   what you're thinking Apple has to do
[00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:59.960]   to make the new tablet a success?
[00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:02.600]   - I think the core question,
[00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:04.800]   and it's just one simple question,
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:07.560]   is if somebody already has a MacBook
[00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:10.680]   or a Windows laptop, but a laptop computer,
[00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:12.600]   and they already have an iPhone,
[00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:15.860]   then where is the use case for the tablet?
[00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:17.880]   And people say things like,
[00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:19.480]   "Oh, well, you use it on the couch
[00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:22.000]   or you use it in bed."
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.400]   - Steve Jobs very famously said,
[00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:25.480]   "I don't want to make a device,
[00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:27.880]   it's just for people using it in the bathroom."
[00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:30.520]   - Right, but you know, people already--
[00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:32.000]   - Who wants to admit that though?
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.160]   - Well, apparently Jobs.
[00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:37.440]   - It's just funny because I saw somebody who argued,
[00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:41.800]   I read one response that nobody actually uses
[00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:43.000]   their laptop on the couch.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.560]   I actually read that on my laptop on my couch.
[00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:48.040]   - Neen, neen, neen, neen, neen,
[00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:50.160]   - Oh, I use a laptop all the time.
[00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:51.480]   - A lot of times.
[00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:53.240]   - 80% of the time in the--
[00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:56.160]   - I don't watch TV without a laptop, period.
[00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:57.360]   - TV by itself is a waste of time.
[00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:58.320]   - Crap.
[00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:00.720]   So my answer to the question,
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:02.600]   and it's just hypothesis,
[00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:04.120]   is not based on any kind of information,
[00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:06.560]   but there has to be an answer to this question,
[00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:08.920]   I believe, for Apple to go to market with the device.
[00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:11.080]   And I think that the answer is
[00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:13.200]   that it is ultimately something
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:15.480]   that people would buy instead of a MacBook.
[00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:16.520]   - Ah.
[00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:18.520]   - So you give really two choices,
[00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:22.160]   it could be instead of an iPhone or instead of a MacBook.
[00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:22.960]   - I think this-- - You go down
[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:24.160]   or you could go up?
[00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:26.200]   - Yeah, but I don't think that it really,
[00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:28.920]   I don't think anything can really replace an iPhone
[00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:30.600]   that doesn't fit in your pocket.
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:31.440]   - Right.
[00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:32.960]   - Two big furnace phone.
[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:33.800]   - Right.
[00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:35.040]   - The big deal has always been,
[00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:36.800]   Apple does not like duplication.
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:39.520]   They're very, very cognizant of the products
[00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:41.080]   they already have in the product line,
[00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:42.920]   and making sure that they're not gonna sell something
[00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:44.000]   that will give,
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.760]   they're not gonna put something in the product line
[00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:47.040]   that will give them an alternative
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:48.240]   to something they already have.
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:50.960]   - But it's your opinion, John, that this,
[00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:53.120]   well see now you're saying something slightly different, Andy,
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:56.800]   because John's saying it has to replace the MacBook
[00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:59.360]   because there is no niche.
[00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:02.840]   There's no place in between an iPhone and an laptop.
[00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:03.680]   There's nothing there. - That's not what
[00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:04.960]   I was getting from John's piece.
[00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:06.760]   - Oh okay, so John correct me,
[00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:08.000]   then I misunderstand.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.160]   - No, I don't think,
[00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:11.720]   I just think that ultimately though,
[00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:12.840]   it's something that you,
[00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:16.560]   it'll be so, I think it's gotta be so full featured though
[00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:21.000]   that you could replace a MacBook with it,
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:22.800]   depending on what you need.
[00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:26.560]   Like it could be the computer you take with you on the road.
[00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:28.400]   - Here's what I took from your piece,
[00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:31.640]   and my thinking that I quibbed completely
[00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:33.880]   from in my opinion from you,
[00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:36.080]   which is there isn't,
[00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:37.840]   and Andy you can argue with me in a second,
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:39.840]   there isn't a niche in between the iPhone
[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:40.800]   and the laptop.
[00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:42.880]   Nobody wants something that's too big
[00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:44.640]   to fit in my breast pocket
[00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:47.240]   that isn't as full featured as my laptop.
[00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:49.520]   I've got kind of the basis covered.
[00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:52.240]   So what I really want is something that is kind of big,
[00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:54.960]   maybe bigger than we thought originally.
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:59.720]   Maybe 10 inches, maybe verging on the sides of a 13 inch,
[00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:02.640]   but just a beautiful screen, just a gorgeous screen,
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:03.720]   that when I sit it down,
[00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:06.600]   notice by the way that Apple now by default,
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:10.400]   ships Bluetooth mouse with touch capabilities
[00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:13.040]   and a little bitty Bluetooth keyboard
[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:15.360]   that really is way too small for the 27.
[00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:19.280]   It kind of be just the right size for a 10 inch screen.
[00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:20.680]   So maybe you sit down,
[00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:22.920]   you put your tablet on the desk, now it's your computer.
[00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:25.240]   You get up, you don't disconnect anything,
[00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:26.360]   you just take it with you,
[00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:28.400]   and it's a rich media device
[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:30.520]   that also has complete computing capabilities.
[00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:32.080]   Is that kind of what you're thinking, John?
[00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:36.840]   - I guess, I mean, I don't have the,
[00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:38.760]   I mean, this is why I write about the stuff
[00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:40.080]   that other people make rather than
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:41.600]   making my own amazing stuff,
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:43.800]   is I don't have the imagination to know
[00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:46.520]   to think exactly what these things could be.
[00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:50.480]   I sort of, I mean, I'm a writer, so I type,
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:52.800]   I mean, I'm really, really fussy about keyboards.
[00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:55.720]   I use a 17 year old Apple extended too,
[00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:58.760]   because it's the only one that clicks right for me.
[00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:01.960]   So, I mean, but that's not,
[00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:05.080]   being a professional writer is not a typical use case.
[00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:08.640]   So I would love it if it worked with a Bluetooth hardware
[00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:11.800]   keyboard instead of just a touchscreen keyboard.
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:14.600]   But I don't know, that, you know, it seems like,
[00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:15.760]   boy, there's an awful lot of people
[00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:17.520]   who've been asking them to do that with the iPhone
[00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:18.720]   and they haven't done it either.
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:20.440]   So I don't know if it, you know,
[00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:22.920]   but it certainly seems more along the lines
[00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:27.920]   of this sort of scope that I'm thinking
[00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:29.680]   that this thing could do.
[00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:31.080]   - Andy, is there a niche, Andy,
[00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:34.640]   that between the laptop and the iPhone that this fills?
[00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:35.880]   'Cause that's what it sounds like you're saying,
[00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:37.160]   it needs to be that.
[00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:39.680]   - Well, I don't think it's a niche so much as Apple
[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:43.480]   can create a brand new device that doesn't make sense
[00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:45.320]   right now because we haven't seen it yet.
[00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:47.560]   But as soon as, I think about the iPod,
[00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:51.520]   think about the iPhone, it became so much more immediately
[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:54.200]   to most of its users than simply a smartphone,
[00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:55.960]   a phone that can get email and web.
[00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:59.120]   It became more of a window into a different,
[00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:03.160]   into a new set of realities for them.
[00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:06.720]   The operative line for my "Sun Times" piece is that,
[00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:10.440]   a lot of people are sort of identifying this supposed tablet
[00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:14.240]   as an e-book reader, as a media reader, as a movie viewer.
[00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:17.240]   And the operative line, I think, is that it's not the book,
[00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:19.720]   it's the eyeglasses you use to see the book with,
[00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:22.440]   that it's going to be, I left for a second
[00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:25.200]   to take fetch my usual netbook,
[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:28.840]   which is an Asus EPC, is the C-Shum All,
[00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:30.600]   which is still my go-to device.
[00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:32.480]   Now take the keyboard off of that.
[00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:34.640]   This is a very nice little device.
[00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:35.640]   - Yeah.
[00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:37.360]   - It was a smaller bezel.
[00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:40.520]   Well, forget about design for a second.
[00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:43.160]   This is something that I take with me a lot of places
[00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:46.560]   that I have no interest in using an actual laptop in.
[00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:48.360]   Now, this, the only way you can improve upon this
[00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:50.600]   is to make it simpler and to make it more,
[00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:53.320]   a better device for different contexts.
[00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:55.000]   If you give me something that's just this,
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.880]   and this is about a 10 inch screen,
[00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:58.800]   so we're looking at if the rumors are true,
[00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:01.560]   this is pretty much, what you can see in this window right now,
[00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:03.640]   is probably what we'll be looking at
[00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:06.080]   in terms of an Apple tablet.
[00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:09.160]   If you give me a device that will let me keep up
[00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:11.360]   with all my news, like when I'm meeting my,
[00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:13.400]   that amount for lunch, I'm meeting my burrito,
[00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:14.800]   will let me read all my books.
[00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:18.200]   The ones that will also let me have third party apps
[00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:19.880]   so that I can add new features to it,
[00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:21.840]   I wouldn't necessarily need the ability
[00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:24.680]   to have Microsoft works or Microsoft Office on it.
[00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:26.000]   I wouldn't even necessarily need to have
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.440]   a full word processor on it,
[00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:30.280]   but the ability to simply open documents that I'm working on
[00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:31.480]   that are on my .Mac account,
[00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:33.840]   or just transferred from the cloud,
[00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:35.320]   would be a very, very big deal.
[00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:37.080]   The ability to pull up an on screen keyboard
[00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:40.200]   and do quick edits would also be a very big deal.
[00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:42.440]   The ability to actually have a real keyboard
[00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:44.400]   via Bluetooth, if that's the way I wanna work
[00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:47.880]   with this one mode, would also be a very big deal.
[00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:50.640]   If this were a device that were significantly less expensive
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:52.360]   than a MacBook, to make it not so much
[00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:54.280]   to not decannableize sales,
[00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:56.440]   but to make it very, very clear to the purchaser
[00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:58.080]   that this is not a notebook,
[00:33:58.080 --> 00:33:59.760]   this is something totally different,
[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:01.280]   they could really have something here,
[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:03.800]   especially if, and this is another area
[00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:06.320]   which the rumors were sort of flying fast and furious around,
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:07.920]   if Apple's being very, very careful
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:10.400]   to get all kinds of different media providers on board,
[00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:12.240]   if this is not just a book,
[00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:14.040]   this is not just a movie player,
[00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:18.920]   this allows you to give a very, very nice context
[00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:20.600]   for all the digital content
[00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:22.520]   and all the digital information entertainment
[00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:25.040]   that's out there, including your own documents,
[00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:27.240]   that's something I could spend five or 600 bucks for,
[00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:28.960]   that would not be an iPhone, it wouldn't be a MacBook,
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:30.880]   but it would be something very, very interesting.
[00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:31.720]   - Do you agree, Alex?
[00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:33.400]   - Well, I think that, I do agree,
[00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:36.120]   I think that there is a niche there that,
[00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:38.800]   you know, as someone who owns a couple laptops
[00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:41.800]   and an iPhone, that I could use something
[00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:44.520]   where I could take it with me when I wanna go like,
[00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:46.040]   which is kinda what I do with the iPhone now,
[00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:49.440]   and I feel like it's a little, it's not quite enough,
[00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:52.640]   but I think that the most revolutionary thing about this
[00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:55.880]   is getting past the arm length, you know,
[00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:57.320]   right now with my iPhone, you know,
[00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:59.240]   that's about as far out as I can go before
[00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:01.520]   it's uncomfortable to watch.
[00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:03.880]   Being able to set it down in the kitchen to watch a,
[00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:06.040]   how to make a mixed drink, or how to make chicken court
[00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:08.840]   on blue, or how to, you know, being able to set it up,
[00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:10.440]   you know, on my dining room table,
[00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:12.520]   and be able to watch whatever, you know,
[00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:15.720]   you know, some kind of show in the news,
[00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:16.960]   or whatever while I'm having breakfast,
[00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:18.400]   being able to, you know, it's this thing
[00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:20.920]   that you end up carrying around, it's also this interface.
[00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:22.880]   I mean, I think that when you look at the educational
[00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:24.560]   possibilities, when you're talking about schools,
[00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:28.800]   I mean, this is what schools issue to kids,
[00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:30.280]   not laptops.
[00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:31.920]   I think I strongly feel this.
[00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:35.000]   This is your textbook and your--
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.400]   It's the textbook, it's what you take your tests on,
[00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:40.480]   it's how you interact when you're in class,
[00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:42.200]   it's what you, you know, it is the,
[00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:45.040]   I just really think this is, you know, a big device.
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:47.360]   But I also came away with John, is that you believe,
[00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:48.760]   and I think you're right on this,
[00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:53.880]   that Apple has to do something much more than a MeToo product.
[00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:55.840]   They have to really break some ground here.
[00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:58.040]   Yeah, it's gotta stand out in certain ways,
[00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:01.840]   and it can't be-- It can't be an Apple Guevter on a keyboard.
[00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:05.160]   And it can't just be an iPod touch with a bigger screen.
[00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:07.080]   I mean, it just can't.
[00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:09.960]   I mean, and like, you know, we were talking even pre-show,
[00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:11.400]   I mean, a big thing with the iPhone,
[00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:14.720]   the whole iPhone interface is very much,
[00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:17.760]   it's not abstract software, it's very much related
[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:19.520]   to the physical size of the device,
[00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:22.080]   that the whole thing is conceived with this idea
[00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:24.840]   that it's on a three and a half inch piece of hardware
[00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:26.840]   that you can fit in one hand,
[00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:29.000]   and effectively do anything on it
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.120]   with holding the device in one hand.
[00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:35.360]   I mean, anybody who walks around the city with their iPhone,
[00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:36.920]   you don't even think about it, really.
[00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:39.360]   I mean, it's typing if you get real good at thumb typing,
[00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:40.760]   isn't that easy with one hand.
[00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:42.400]   But for most of the things you do on your iPhone,
[00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:46.800]   like looking things up on a map or calling somebody,
[00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:50.080]   or, you know, web surfing, you can do the whole thing,
[00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:52.320]   you can go from the lower left corner
[00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:54.800]   to the top right corner with your one thumb
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:56.440]   while holding it in one hand.
[00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:59.840]   Why in the world would you use a software interface
[00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:03.520]   designed for corner to corner one hand use
[00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:04.960]   on a three and a half inch screen?
[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:08.680]   Why would that you ever blow that up to fit on a 10 inch screen?
[00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:11.000]   It would be goofy.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:14.400]   And if it's only five or six inch screen,
[00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:16.240]   which seems like all the rumors
[00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:19.520]   in the Wall Street Journal yesterday said 10 inch screen.
[00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:20.680]   It's gotta be bad.
[00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:22.880]   Everybody is sort of circling in on 10 inches,
[00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:26.280]   which seems like a better, much more reasonable size
[00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:27.960]   for reading.
[00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:29.280]   Five inches, six inches.
[00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:31.320]   If you just take a piece of cardboard or something
[00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:34.320]   and make like a five or six inch screen, it's interesting.
[00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:38.240]   But it's not that much bigger than an iPhone, really,
[00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:40.560]   to make reading or watching movies
[00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:44.360]   or something a more a better experience.
[00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:46.440]   It's not bigger, bigger enough.
[00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:49.640]   - I think it's also gonna cause a revolution in clothing.
[00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:50.480]   - Oh.
[00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:51.320]   - Big pockets.
[00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:52.160]   You've said that before.
[00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:54.120]   People are gonna have Captain Kangaroo pockets now
[00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:55.120]   because they have to carry--
[00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:55.960]   - They're either, it just a question.
[00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:57.480]   - I'd love like Captain Little Baby.
[00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:58.320]   - Well, the thing is, is that I--
[00:37:58.320 --> 00:37:59.840]   - I'm gonna connect this for years.
[00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:00.680]   - I don't know if I talk about this before.
[00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:02.880]   - Andy already carries his netbook and his rear.
[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:04.880]   - I bought a pair of pants at Eddie Bauer.
[00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:05.720]   - Pocket, rear pocket.
[00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:06.920]   - I'm sorry, did I say rear pocket?
[00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:07.760]   - Yes, thank you.
[00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:09.600]   - I bought a-- - It's a significant difference.
[00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:11.240]   - I bought a pair of pants at Eddie Bauer
[00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:13.320]   with a zip pocket on one side
[00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:15.920]   that is not close to the size of the iPhone.
[00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:18.400]   It is exactly the size of the iPhone.
[00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:19.720]   - No, I'm sure people do that.
[00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:22.040]   - That pocket was made for an iPhone.
[00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:23.880]   You know, and the thing is, is in the same way,
[00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:26.360]   a slightly rearranged cargo pant pocket
[00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:27.880]   will fit one of these things in there.
[00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:28.840]   And I think that's what we're gonna--
[00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:29.680]   - I know.
[00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:30.760]   What about a detachable keyboard?
[00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:32.280]   What about making it more like a notebook?
[00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:37.200]   What about saying it's an $800 portable notebook
[00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:38.400]   with a detachable keyboard?
[00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:39.240]   Or maybe it's--
[00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:40.640]   - I don't think I need a detachable keyboard.
[00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:42.800]   I think I wanna have, I do wanna have a Bluetooth access,
[00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:43.640]   though.
[00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:45.040]   That would be really difficult for me
[00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:47.040]   if I didn't have Bluetooth for--
[00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:48.440]   - Music for phone for what?
[00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:49.440]   - I'm sorry, Bluetooth for the--
[00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:50.280]   - For the keyboard.
[00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:51.120]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:53.560]   - There's, I think the big thing
[00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:55.720]   to keep your mind on is,
[00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:58.560]   when Cartage reached the new world,
[00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:00.880]   they had to schmend and shut fire to a ship.
[00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:03.440]   Most left them very well-motivated.
[00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:06.600]   If Apple says, "Here's a keyboard,"
[00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:08.080]   well, here's a USB port, it will accept
[00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:10.600]   that a USB keyboard, that will encourage everybody to say,
[00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:12.000]   "Oh, so we will never even think,
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.440]   "try to think of this as anything other than a notebook."
[00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:17.120]   Whereas if they simply say, "Yeah, well,
[00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:19.200]   "there's a keyboard profile if you want to."
[00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:20.160]   Well, no, we're not also,
[00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:21.240]   we're not gonna give you a kickstand
[00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:22.880]   or anything to make it really, really easy.
[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:24.120]   But if you want to bring your own,
[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:24.960]   that's perfectly fine.
[00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:27.480]   - So Apple needs to burn the ships.
[00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:29.960]   - Apple needs to, and Apple is going to say
[00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:31.400]   that this is a brand new thing.
[00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:32.200]   They're going to have,
[00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:34.000]   if they have a success with this,
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.280]   they will be by diffusing any argument
[00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:39.680]   from the very, very get-go of,
[00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:42.120]   why would I want to buy this instead of a MacBook?
[00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:42.960]   Well, this isn't a MacBook.
[00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:44.840]   Well, why would I want to buy this instead of an iPod Touch?
[00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:46.000]   Well, this isn't an iPod Touch,
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:46.840]   this is a brand new thing.
[00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:47.760]   - Well, let's get crazy then.
[00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:49.080]   What do we do?
[00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:50.160]   I know, John, you're right,
[00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:51.400]   and I put myself in the same shoes.
[00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:52.720]   If I could outthink Steve Jobs,
[00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:55.000]   I wouldn't be sitting on this ball.
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   But let's go crazy, let's get out of the box.
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:01.360]   What do you do to distinguish this so far?
[00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:04.000]   I haven't heard anything that frankly is that different.
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:07.440]   - I think that the thing that distinguishes this hardware--
[00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:08.280]   - Content deals?
[00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:09.120]   - It's the content deals.
[00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:09.960]   - It's the content deals.
[00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:11.120]   - Well, it's not just the content deals.
[00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:12.160]   It's a fact that, I mean,
[00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:14.400]   I think that every developer under the sun
[00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:15.400]   will jump on this,
[00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:17.600]   but I will be the devil's advocate
[00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:19.160]   if they had been making content deals,
[00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:21.040]   surely we would have heard something like that.
[00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:21.880]   - I just don't think,
[00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:24.240]   content deals are as important as the app store.
[00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:27.240]   - So you think having the chain and then,
[00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:28.320]   well, they've done that before?
[00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:30.440]   - They've done that before, they did that with TV,
[00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:31.400]   they did it with movies,
[00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:33.600]   they even did it with really iTunes itself.
[00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:36.480]   - Yeah, but I think that's gonna be massive.
[00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:40.040]   That these content developers who,
[00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:40.960]   'cause everyone knows that the people
[00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:42.800]   who really made out well on the iPhone
[00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:44.240]   were the most-- - What if you make
[00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:46.440]   a 10 inch screen and you do, in fact,
[00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:49.080]   you did get a deal with Disney and CBS
[00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:53.480]   to do what they call my TV or whatever they were talking
[00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:56.480]   about, $30 a month, and now it's your TV set.
[00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:57.320]   Is that good?
[00:40:57.320 --> 00:40:58.200]   Is that compelling?
[00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:00.040]   - If you can-- - Not for me.
[00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:00.880]   - Nope.
[00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:02.280]   - If you link it for you-- - And not enough.
[00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:03.880]   - If I'm able to link it to my media center,
[00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:07.360]   so I have my Drobo hooked up to my Mac Mini
[00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:08.720]   and that's on my Wi-Fi network
[00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:10.040]   and I'm able to watch everything that I have on that.
[00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:12.480]   - Let's face it, that's the Zoom HD.
[00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:13.280]   - Yeah, but it's not big enough.
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:14.720]   I'm saying I could have that big screen
[00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:16.720]   that connects seamlessly, not--
[00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:18.360]   - It's 10, no work. - It's not 10, no work.
[00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:20.720]   It's big enough for me, I'd be fine with it.
[00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:22.480]   It's not, by the way, going to be our show title,
[00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:25.240]   so just stop thinking it is.
[00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:28.080]   - We'll see, still, still.
[00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:28.920]   - How far to go?
[00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:31.720]   (laughing)
[00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:34.280]   - John's over it. - He's 10 inches big enough.
[00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:36.720]   - Oh, I definitely, I mean, I can't imagine
[00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:38.600]   that it would be much bigger than that.
[00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:41.440]   I mean, anything bigger, and I've actually done, you know,
[00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:43.800]   gone around and like measured physical books
[00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:46.280]   and notebooks and like, well, if it was seven inches,
[00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:47.400]   it would be about this big.
[00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:50.880]   I mean, you know, take an eight and a half by 11,
[00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:52.440]   she'd have paper. - So it would be safe
[00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:53.960]   to say John Gruber has measured
[00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:55.960]   and says 10 inches is big enough.
[00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:57.920]   (laughing)
[00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:00.640]   - So there's an episode of our week being served.
[00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:01.640]   - There you go.
[00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:03.800]   Now, I, you know, and it depends on the,
[00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:06.120]   I mean, everybody seems to be circling in
[00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:09.880]   on periodical publishers, newspapers and magazines
[00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:11.560]   who obviously have had, you know--
[00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:12.480]   - And we do know they've done,
[00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:13.720]   they've talked to The Times, right?
[00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:15.440]   We know that much.
[00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:17.200]   Times intimated that they had talked to them,
[00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:18.680]   that Apple had talked to them.
[00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:20.120]   - You know what though, it was hard to tell though,
[00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:24.040]   if you really look at that without wishful thinking eyeglasses,
[00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:27.000]   a comment from Times, you know, editor in chief
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:28.840]   or whatever they call him, Bill Keller.
[00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:31.240]   It was hard to tell whether that was actually like,
[00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:32.960]   he knew that they were doing something
[00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:36.520]   or whether he was just saying it, like,
[00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:38.480]   look, everybody knows that they're doing, you know,
[00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:40.000]   the same way that we're talking about it,
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.360]   that we know that Apple's doing it,
[00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:45.480]   but we don't know, know that Apple's doing this.
[00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:48.920]   - It was very hard to tell whether, you know, his comment.
[00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:49.760]   I don't know.
[00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:53.400]   And it almost makes me think that it was more like
[00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:55.200]   a common knowledge type remark,
[00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:58.160]   simply because to be the editor in chief of The Times,
[00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:00.640]   you kind of have to be pretty good at keeping secrets.
[00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:03.240]   I mean, so if he was really that informed,
[00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:05.240]   I don't know that he would have let that slip casually.
[00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:06.080]   - Right.
[00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:08.480]   - I mean, with, you know, sources--
[00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:10.080]   - So it's safe to say they probably don't have
[00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:11.800]   any content deals.
[00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:12.640]   - I don't know.
[00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:13.480]   - I don't know about that.
[00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:15.480]   - Generally, anybody that works with Apple
[00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:17.000]   on a real deal-- - Is locked in the room right now.
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:20.440]   - Well, if you know anything about what Apple's doing,
[00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:22.520]   you generally won't say it.
[00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:24.400]   You know, that's usually the rule of thought.
[00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:28.600]   - Also, I can't really talk about details,
[00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:32.640]   but I've heard in several years on several different topics,
[00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:36.440]   I've heard, I've talked to people who have had
[00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:39.200]   communications with Apple, where Apple wanted to make it
[00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:42.560]   very clear, wanted to send a very clear message
[00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:45.040]   to this individual about their future plans,
[00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:48.160]   without telling them anything about their future plans.
[00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:52.240]   Kind of like saying, gosh, that's really, really cool
[00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:56.000]   how you're dumping raw sewage into the backyard like that.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.920]   I'm wondering if that's gonna be a good idea
[00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:00.480]   two years from now, when the EPA,
[00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:03.640]   is the new administration comes in.
[00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:05.520]   You know, it's not a case of saying,
[00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:08.360]   we are making plans to introduce this device
[00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:10.160]   on this quarter of this year.
[00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:11.560]   Therefore, you wanna be in a good position
[00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:14.080]   to take advantage of that by exploiting open APIs,
[00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:16.240]   maximizing all your content, moving to a CMS
[00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:18.160]   for all of your publication needs.
[00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:20.560]   They have a way of saying, interesting,
[00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:21.520]   how are you using it that way?
[00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:23.560]   We think that that's not a great way to go,
[00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:25.400]   but good luck with that.
[00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:27.600]   And when I mentioned having conversations
[00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:29.400]   with people that talk to Apple that way,
[00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:31.600]   I'm talking about developers who've been spoken to
[00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:33.760]   about the way they develop their software,
[00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:36.520]   people who are very, very close partners,
[00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:39.080]   who were about to do something, let's say,
[00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:40.880]   that would be very, very unfortunate
[00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:43.200]   given Apple's future plans.
[00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:46.000]   None of them were able to say Apple told me in advance
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:47.600]   or even hinted in advance that there was going
[00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:49.080]   to be specific things done.
[00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:52.000]   They simply made a statement to me in private
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.040]   and very, very quietly that made it clear that
[00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:56.960]   if I put myself in a position to be here in two years,
[00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:58.200]   that would work out very, very well.
[00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:00.760]   - Remember Condi Nast said they were gonna do any reader,
[00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:03.640]   I mean, a lot of newspapers, Murdoch intimated,
[00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:06.120]   they would do a reader, Hearst was, you know.
[00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:07.560]   - Hearst made more announcements,
[00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:10.160]   so they're not so much, they're helping a reader.
[00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:11.000]   - And it got quiet.
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:11.840]   - What Condi Nast is Hearst.
[00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:12.680]   - It got quiet.
[00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:15.360]   So do you think that that's what happened?
[00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:18.400]   That maybe some of these guys were moving down that path
[00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:21.240]   and then Apple said, you don't wanna do that.
[00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:22.320]   - No, not necessarily.
[00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:24.720]   I think it's more of a case where they're at a stage
[00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:28.360]   where they, every time I talk to hardware manufacturers
[00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:31.120]   and distributors, you can't underestimate
[00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:33.520]   what effect this announcement is going to have,
[00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:35.760]   not in that they have specific business plans
[00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:39.480]   so much as they don't know, right now they're building,
[00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:41.160]   they're building a spacecraft for a planet
[00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:42.600]   they've never been to before.
[00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:43.960]   When Apple makes its announcement,
[00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:45.640]   then they will know what kind of terrain
[00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:49.080]   that the hardware manufacturer and these content distributors
[00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:51.640]   have to navigate and that will define
[00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:54.760]   exactly the sort of products that they're gonna create.
[00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:57.240]   Not necessarily because they're gonna absolutely make it
[00:45:57.240 --> 00:45:59.080]   for this device and only this device,
[00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:00.640]   but it will define the landscape
[00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:04.160]   of digital content distribution and consumption.
[00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:05.000]   So--
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:06.240]   - Well, I think someone said draws us back to iTunes.
[00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:07.080]   I mean, the thing is--
[00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:08.560]   - And Lala.
[00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:09.400]   Yeah.
[00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:10.520]   Is Lala part of this?
[00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:11.360]   - I don't know if it's part of this.
[00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:14.600]   - What if you had a device that would be the ultimate
[00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:18.720]   like audio, video, text?
[00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:21.200]   It's all in this device.
[00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:23.120]   Then keyboard doesn't become, it's not as important,
[00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:24.440]   it's really a consumption device.
[00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:25.880]   What if it's just a consumption device?
[00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:27.120]   Is that compelling?
[00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:27.960]   - Not for 800.
[00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:28.800]   - It's not enough.
[00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:29.640]   - Not for 800.
[00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:30.480]   - But the--
[00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:31.400]   - What if it's subsidized?
[00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:33.440]   - Now, I think it's gotta be at the very least though,
[00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:36.880]   it's gotta be consumption plus communication.
[00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:39.920]   I mean, that to me is the whole secret to when
[00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:43.960]   this entire computing racket went mainstream
[00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:46.520]   and Laina, like when all of our moms got computers
[00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:48.680]   and everything, it's when computers became communication
[00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:53.200]   devices and it's Twitter and sharing photos
[00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:56.760]   and texting and stuff like that.
[00:46:56.760 --> 00:46:58.440]   But there's gotta be that type of angle to it.
[00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:00.440]   - I think you got Apple has just acquired, by the way,
[00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:02.720]   this just came in, Apple has just acquired,
[00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:04.920]   remember they were in the bidding for AdMob,
[00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:06.860]   they didn't get AdMob, they've acquired courts,
[00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:09.880]   which is an AdMob, or I'm sorry, Quattro Wireless,
[00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:13.760]   which is an AdMob-like wireless advertising company.
[00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:15.560]   They were, this is not a typical--
[00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:16.400]   - They're doing their own maps.
[00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:17.320]   - They're doing their own maps.
[00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:19.040]   - It's not a typical Apple acquisition.
[00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:22.360]   So you're thinking now, okay, they want an advertising company,
[00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:24.360]   of course they see a lot of money be made by AdMob
[00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:26.600]   on the iPhone, maybe they just wanna cut of it,
[00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:29.320]   or maybe they wanna subsidize something.
[00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:34.320]   It's gonna have Wi-Fi, but does it have to have 3G?
[00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:35.240]   - I don't think so.
[00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:37.700]   - I think I submit that's a problem, because I already have,
[00:47:37.700 --> 00:47:39.740]   I'm already paying for 3G.
[00:47:39.740 --> 00:47:40.580]   - Yeah, that's a--
[00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:42.860]   - I don't want another $60 a month bill.
[00:47:42.860 --> 00:47:46.260]   - No, and you could say, well, it will just tether
[00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:47.540]   with your iPhone, but guess what,
[00:47:47.540 --> 00:47:48.700]   if you live in the United States,
[00:47:48.700 --> 00:47:50.860]   you still can't tether with your iPhone.
[00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:51.780]   So--
[00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:54.380]   - Well, I think that says no interest in allowing anybody--
[00:47:54.380 --> 00:47:55.580]   - They said they would allow tethering,
[00:47:55.580 --> 00:47:57.020]   maybe this is a joint announcement.
[00:47:57.020 --> 00:47:58.980]   - No, but AT&T did say they were gonna allow tethering.
[00:47:58.980 --> 00:48:00.980]   - If AT&T's having trouble with data,
[00:48:00.980 --> 00:48:03.300]   and people with this device,
[00:48:03.300 --> 00:48:05.920]   now download the phrase your episodes.
[00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:06.760]   - Yeah, yeah, I mean--
[00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:07.600]   - And see what happens.
[00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:08.680]   - That resolution, 'cause it's gonna be,
[00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:11.240]   my guess is probably gonna be 960 by 540.
[00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:13.040]   It's probably gonna be somewhere close to the resolution
[00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:15.560]   that it's gonna play back at, and that would be--
[00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:16.400]   - What is the minimum--
[00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:17.560]   - For a 1080, 480p?
[00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:20.160]   - Yeah, 800 by 40.
[00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:22.400]   Well, I think 960 by 540, I'm guessing--
[00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:23.760]   - My 40's pretty good.
[00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:24.600]   540 is great.
[00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:25.440]   - Yeah, but that's video too.
[00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:28.680]   I think too, I mean, and assuming that publications,
[00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:31.160]   newspapers, and magazines are gonna be a big part of this,
[00:48:31.160 --> 00:48:32.960]   they're gonna have to answer the question,
[00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:35.580]   why would I buy, why would I subscribe
[00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:38.700]   to the New York Times, just to use everybody's favorite example,
[00:48:38.700 --> 00:48:41.340]   or the wonderful Chicago Sun-Times?
[00:48:41.340 --> 00:48:45.740]   Why would I subscribe to it and pay, presumably,
[00:48:45.740 --> 00:48:47.100]   to get it on this tablet,
[00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:48.940]   instead of just reading the website for free?
[00:48:48.940 --> 00:48:50.300]   And I think part of that is gonna be
[00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:52.220]   that it's gonna be a much better experience.
[00:48:52.220 --> 00:48:56.660]   Bigger pictures, more video integrated with--
[00:48:56.660 --> 00:48:59.860]   - What's the minimum resolution you could have for a reader?
[00:49:01.620 --> 00:49:03.340]   - I think 90 by 540 is pretty close to it.
[00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:04.180]   - 720.
[00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:07.900]   - I don't know, I think for a reader, it's gotta be more,
[00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:10.820]   I tend to think more pixels for reading
[00:49:10.820 --> 00:49:12.440]   because I think they're gonna want the text
[00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:13.820]   to be really, really crisp.
[00:49:13.820 --> 00:49:16.380]   - I was talking on the Twitter with Veronica Belmont,
[00:49:16.380 --> 00:49:18.340]   for instance, I said, oh, she's a big Kindle user,
[00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:20.380]   I said, what if Apple comes out, yeah,
[00:49:20.380 --> 00:49:22.340]   you have to charge it every night, but it's color,
[00:49:22.340 --> 00:49:24.540]   it's more lively, it's got animations,
[00:49:24.540 --> 00:49:27.900]   it's got all that rich media that John was just talking about.
[00:49:27.900 --> 00:49:28.740]   Wouldn't you trade it?
[00:49:28.740 --> 00:49:31.060]   She said, no, I really like the crispness,
[00:49:31.060 --> 00:49:33.260]   the solidity of the Kindle screen,
[00:49:33.260 --> 00:49:35.500]   I think she's probably not alone on that.
[00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:37.140]   - So what do you need to do something--
[00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:39.300]   - Do you like the iPhone, Chris?
[00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:41.900]   - No, I asked her, do you read on the iPhone?
[00:49:41.900 --> 00:49:42.740]   She said, no.
[00:49:42.740 --> 00:49:43.580]   - Okay.
[00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:46.620]   Well, there's so many factors that go into readability
[00:49:46.620 --> 00:49:50.220]   of which pixels per inch is only one part of it.
[00:49:50.220 --> 00:49:53.100]   One of the things I desperately don't like about Android
[00:49:53.100 --> 00:49:58.100]   is that the simple problem of typography on that screen,
[00:49:59.180 --> 00:50:01.420]   I'm convinced that Apple puts a lot of work
[00:50:01.420 --> 00:50:05.500]   into making sure that what's the letter spacing
[00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:07.620]   for this font that will make this word
[00:50:07.620 --> 00:50:10.820]   the most readable at this size on this window.
[00:50:10.820 --> 00:50:12.020]   And that really comes across,
[00:50:12.020 --> 00:50:13.820]   there are many, many times when,
[00:50:13.820 --> 00:50:17.500]   I know I'm sorry, I should correct myself, by default,
[00:50:17.500 --> 00:50:20.260]   even though the iPhone screen was lower in resolution
[00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:21.380]   than the Droid screen,
[00:50:21.380 --> 00:50:24.740]   text was almost always much easier to read on the iPhone
[00:50:24.740 --> 00:50:27.300]   because they handled the typography that much better.
[00:50:27.300 --> 00:50:28.140]   So that's not it.
[00:50:28.140 --> 00:50:31.100]   This was probably the only thing, it's not the same type.
[00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:32.980]   - Here's another story that might change
[00:50:32.980 --> 00:50:35.540]   our complexion here, Apple and Disney,
[00:50:35.540 --> 00:50:39.780]   according to Pat and late Apple,
[00:50:39.780 --> 00:50:41.860]   maybe working together to develop a video
[00:50:41.860 --> 00:50:44.900]   and multimedia on demand service via Mobile Me.
[00:50:44.900 --> 00:50:49.060]   Remember Apple was building all those data centers.
[00:50:49.060 --> 00:50:53.140]   The report cites in October 2009,
[00:50:53.140 --> 00:50:54.620]   Apple patent enabling a system
[00:50:54.620 --> 00:50:57.060]   by which Mobile Me members could partially view television
[00:50:57.060 --> 00:50:58.900]   or any video content on their iPhone
[00:50:58.900 --> 00:51:01.660]   and switch to Apple TV or Mac or whatever
[00:51:01.660 --> 00:51:03.060]   in their return home, continue viewing,
[00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:06.060]   just like the Kindle does that, picks it up.
[00:51:06.060 --> 00:51:08.180]   Times says, "We'll see this kind of service
[00:51:08.180 --> 00:51:09.820]   "make a splash at CES this week
[00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:13.100]   "with Disney's forthcoming Key Chest program
[00:51:13.100 --> 00:51:15.140]   "debuing their,
[00:51:15.140 --> 00:51:17.860]   "or is Apple and Disney are basically the same company
[00:51:17.860 --> 00:51:22.100]   "since Steve is a major shareholder in Disney."
[00:51:22.100 --> 00:51:24.980]   That's the problem is Apple can make deals like this
[00:51:24.980 --> 00:51:28.260]   with Disney, but it's hard to make them with anybody else.
[00:51:28.260 --> 00:51:29.660]   But that's interesting.
[00:51:29.660 --> 00:51:33.660]   I think we're leaning towards a very good content device,
[00:51:33.660 --> 00:51:35.940]   text, audio and video, right?
[00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:36.780]   - Yep.
[00:51:36.780 --> 00:51:37.620]   - Yep.
[00:51:37.620 --> 00:51:39.020]   - How much else does it have to have?
[00:51:39.020 --> 00:51:40.700]   Does it have to be,
[00:51:40.700 --> 00:51:43.700]   could you have to be able to participate in social media?
[00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:44.860]   Has to be a communications device.
[00:51:44.860 --> 00:51:46.100]   - I think that if it,
[00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:47.380]   I will say that if it just,
[00:51:47.380 --> 00:51:48.420]   I think it would be a huge hit.
[00:51:48.420 --> 00:51:49.420]   I think that,
[00:51:49.420 --> 00:51:52.020]   I think if it did what the iPhone could do
[00:51:52.020 --> 00:51:54.380]   plus access to a keyboard,
[00:51:54.380 --> 00:51:56.100]   it'd be a pretty big hit.
[00:51:56.100 --> 00:51:57.340]   - That would be enough.
[00:51:57.340 --> 00:51:59.860]   - Yeah, well, $800, $700.
[00:51:59.860 --> 00:52:03.580]   - If you were able to develop the applications
[00:52:03.580 --> 00:52:05.020]   that we're able to see on an iPhone,
[00:52:05.020 --> 00:52:07.540]   but had larger real estate and so on and so forth,
[00:52:07.540 --> 00:52:08.380]   you know, I know--
[00:52:08.380 --> 00:52:09.220]   - Well, that's key too, isn't it?
[00:52:09.220 --> 00:52:10.300]   Now, it can't be,
[00:52:10.300 --> 00:52:12.020]   and this is another bit of speculation.
[00:52:12.020 --> 00:52:13.540]   I know John, you've written about this.
[00:52:13.540 --> 00:52:15.940]   Is it OS X?
[00:52:15.940 --> 00:52:17.220]   Is it iPhone OS?
[00:52:17.220 --> 00:52:19.060]   Is it something in between?
[00:52:19.060 --> 00:52:19.900]   And I think--
[00:52:19.900 --> 00:52:22.900]   - I'm almost certain that it's a third OS, you know.
[00:52:22.900 --> 00:52:24.260]   But then can you,
[00:52:24.260 --> 00:52:25.620]   you gotta make it so the developers
[00:52:25.620 --> 00:52:29.140]   can quickly get from one to the other, though, all right?
[00:52:29.140 --> 00:52:30.460]   - I don't think that's like--
[00:52:30.460 --> 00:52:32.220]   - I don't think that'll be that.
[00:52:32.220 --> 00:52:34.580]   - Developers do like the money they make
[00:52:34.580 --> 00:52:36.420]   on the iPhone platform and would well come probably not.
[00:52:36.420 --> 00:52:37.740]   - I would be absolutely shocked
[00:52:37.740 --> 00:52:41.380]   if it didn't go into the same bio structure as OS X
[00:52:41.380 --> 00:52:42.380]   in the App Store.
[00:52:42.380 --> 00:52:44.860]   I'd be very, very shocked if it were not,
[00:52:44.860 --> 00:52:48.140]   if there weren't a very, very linear path
[00:52:48.140 --> 00:52:49.620]   between being an iPhone developer
[00:52:49.620 --> 00:52:51.580]   and being a tablet developer,
[00:52:51.580 --> 00:52:53.740]   I'm not saying that you could port one application
[00:52:53.740 --> 00:52:55.180]   the other in an afternoon,
[00:52:55.180 --> 00:52:56.500]   but I would be very, very shocked
[00:52:56.500 --> 00:52:58.340]   if there weren't a very linear process
[00:52:58.340 --> 00:53:01.180]   to build upon the experience
[00:53:01.180 --> 00:53:02.580]   that you've developed as an iPhone developer.
[00:53:02.580 --> 00:53:05.060]   - Custom UI though for a larger screen or no?
[00:53:05.060 --> 00:53:07.700]   - Well, yeah, it'd be foolish if it were just like the iPhone.
[00:53:07.700 --> 00:53:09.740]   I don't think that an iPhone interface
[00:53:09.740 --> 00:53:11.500]   completely makes sense, particularly given
[00:53:11.500 --> 00:53:15.180]   that it's developed for no windows, one screen,
[00:53:15.180 --> 00:53:16.580]   and gestures that can be done
[00:53:16.580 --> 00:53:17.980]   just with moving your thumb around.
[00:53:17.980 --> 00:53:19.660]   - I say very little storage
[00:53:19.660 --> 00:53:22.500]   because Hollywood's most afraid of storage.
[00:53:22.500 --> 00:53:23.860]   - Oh, how about that?
[00:53:23.860 --> 00:53:25.020]   - I don't know, probably.
[00:53:25.020 --> 00:53:25.860]   - No?
[00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:28.540]   - It's 32 is gonna have to be the minimum.
[00:53:28.540 --> 00:53:29.780]   That's gonna be the four gig.
[00:53:29.780 --> 00:53:31.860]   - I say all streaming all the time
[00:53:31.860 --> 00:53:33.820]   because then you can make content these.
[00:53:33.820 --> 00:53:35.540]   - I still think it's 32 minimum.
[00:53:35.540 --> 00:53:36.380]   - 32 to 64.
[00:53:36.380 --> 00:53:38.260]   I think those are the two versions.
[00:53:38.260 --> 00:53:39.420]   - And I'm just telling you,
[00:53:39.420 --> 00:53:42.460]   I think that these magazines and, you know,
[00:53:42.460 --> 00:53:44.380]   I think books are gonna be part of it.
[00:53:44.380 --> 00:53:47.620]   They're gonna take up space.
[00:53:47.620 --> 00:53:50.300]   I think that a high quality version of, you know,
[00:53:50.300 --> 00:53:54.780]   sports illustrated or Newsweek or something like that
[00:53:54.780 --> 00:53:57.260]   is gonna take up, you know, a decent chunk of space.
[00:53:57.260 --> 00:53:59.260]   - That actually is an area where Kindle doesn't do very well.
[00:53:59.260 --> 00:54:02.100]   It's great in linear novels, but it's terrible for browsing.
[00:54:02.100 --> 00:54:03.940]   And it's something larger with color
[00:54:03.940 --> 00:54:06.300]   that was more browsable, could really do better.
[00:54:06.300 --> 00:54:10.260]   That times keeps playing with different interfaces on windows
[00:54:10.260 --> 00:54:11.980]   that is more browsable.
[00:54:11.980 --> 00:54:13.740]   - I think that the one of the next,
[00:54:13.740 --> 00:54:15.460]   what the iPhone really represents.
[00:54:15.460 --> 00:54:17.700]   And I think that when we started making movies,
[00:54:17.700 --> 00:54:20.100]   you know, we just put cameras in front of stages.
[00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:21.940]   You know, it just took a stage, you know,
[00:54:21.940 --> 00:54:23.820]   just did a stage play in front of a camera.
[00:54:23.820 --> 00:54:25.380]   By the time we got to the Matrix,
[00:54:25.380 --> 00:54:27.380]   we had completely changed the way we tell a story.
[00:54:27.380 --> 00:54:31.260]   You know, in the same way, the Kindle is we have moved--
[00:54:31.260 --> 00:54:32.100]   - It's very linear.
[00:54:32.100 --> 00:54:32.940]   - We're shooting the stage.
[00:54:32.940 --> 00:54:33.780]   - Yep.
[00:54:33.780 --> 00:54:34.860]   - We've moved the experience of reading
[00:54:34.860 --> 00:54:35.940]   to an electronic device.
[00:54:35.940 --> 00:54:38.300]   - But it's still a book that you turn pages.
[00:54:38.300 --> 00:54:41.940]   - The iPhone is the beginning, I think, of the next step.
[00:54:41.940 --> 00:54:44.940]   When you start looking at being able to interact with video,
[00:54:44.940 --> 00:54:47.740]   being able to have magazine articles with video included--
[00:54:47.740 --> 00:54:48.580]   - I think that's what this is.
[00:54:48.580 --> 00:54:50.540]   - This is a periodical delivery system.
[00:54:50.540 --> 00:54:51.540]   - Because not a book delivery system.
[00:54:51.540 --> 00:54:52.620]   - When you look at, I don't know who was doing it,
[00:54:52.620 --> 00:54:54.500]   was it the Times or was it Wired?
[00:54:54.500 --> 00:54:57.580]   Or someone was doing a thing where they shot the cover on a red.
[00:54:57.580 --> 00:54:58.420]   - Right.
[00:54:58.420 --> 00:54:59.740]   - You know, so there was like, there was a still.
[00:54:59.740 --> 00:55:00.580]   - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:55:00.580 --> 00:55:02.460]   - But they showed there was a whole video
[00:55:02.460 --> 00:55:03.300]   that became the cover.
[00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:05.580]   And so the thing is, is you start doing that hyperlinks
[00:55:05.580 --> 00:55:08.060]   in between added detail to the article
[00:55:08.060 --> 00:55:09.940]   that wasn't included in the linear article.
[00:55:09.940 --> 00:55:12.660]   All these things are things that we've been, you know,
[00:55:12.660 --> 00:55:14.060]   I think we've been waiting to happen.
[00:55:14.060 --> 00:55:15.500]   Like we thought this was gonna be the next thing,
[00:55:15.500 --> 00:55:18.300]   but the problem was, even though PDF has made that available
[00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:21.140]   since the like mid 90s, there hasn't been a device
[00:55:21.140 --> 00:55:23.260]   that made it really easy to ingest.
[00:55:23.260 --> 00:55:25.380]   And I think that this is, I think this could really
[00:55:25.380 --> 00:55:26.860]   be the beginning of that.
[00:55:26.860 --> 00:55:29.740]   - Yeah, that's a very famous concept video
[00:55:29.740 --> 00:55:32.300]   that was produced by the consulting agency,
[00:55:32.300 --> 00:55:34.220]   that design agency that was working for Time Inc,
[00:55:34.220 --> 00:55:36.860]   they did a mock up of what a digital version
[00:55:36.860 --> 00:55:39.940]   of sports illustrated would be like on an unspecified
[00:55:39.940 --> 00:55:41.900]   tablet sized color device with high,
[00:55:41.900 --> 00:55:44.340]   with very, very good video and touch features.
[00:55:44.340 --> 00:55:46.940]   And it really does exemplify everything that you talk to.
[00:55:46.940 --> 00:55:48.580]   - You could do something amazing.
[00:55:48.580 --> 00:55:50.700]   - If Apple didn't have to protect AT&T
[00:55:50.700 --> 00:55:53.580]   in its iPhone business, would they build a phone
[00:55:53.580 --> 00:55:54.940]   in this or not?
[00:55:54.940 --> 00:55:56.940]   - I still understand that, well, you know,
[00:55:56.940 --> 00:55:58.780]   but if you do, then you can't, don't you can't
[00:55:58.780 --> 00:56:00.340]   analyze your, maybe they would.
[00:56:00.340 --> 00:56:03.060]   - Yeah, but I don't know, I just don't see
[00:56:03.060 --> 00:56:05.300]   what having a phone on a 10 inch device would do.
[00:56:05.300 --> 00:56:06.140]   I mean, it's the phone.
[00:56:06.140 --> 00:56:08.820]   - I don't think this is what Devore had showed us.
[00:56:08.820 --> 00:56:10.620]   He had the Newton.
[00:56:11.580 --> 00:56:13.620]   - Hello, yeah, I'll be right with you.
[00:56:13.620 --> 00:56:16.500]   - Well, but it's too, it doesn't, but, but,
[00:56:16.500 --> 00:56:18.140]   but what if you have a, you know,
[00:56:18.140 --> 00:56:20.140]   headphone plugged into this and you're sitting here?
[00:56:20.140 --> 00:56:22.420]   You're, yeah, I mean, people are getting used to the wireless.
[00:56:22.420 --> 00:56:24.100]   - I don't ever put my iPhone, I get a headache
[00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:25.980]   if I put my iPhone up against my ear for very long.
[00:56:25.980 --> 00:56:28.420]   So I don't, I think Apple's been seating all these reports
[00:56:28.420 --> 00:56:30.900]   that it's dangerous to put your phone next to your head.
[00:56:30.900 --> 00:56:32.500]   (laughing)
[00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:34.100]   I just, I don't, I don't, I don't do it.
[00:56:34.100 --> 00:56:34.940]   - I'll do it in her hand.
[00:56:34.940 --> 00:56:37.220]   - By the way, Skype has announced 720P versions
[00:56:37.220 --> 00:56:38.980]   and HD versions.
[00:56:38.980 --> 00:56:43.980]   So now, now put it on a 720P 10-inch Wi-Fi enabled screen
[00:56:43.980 --> 00:56:46.860]   that may be a 3G module.
[00:56:46.860 --> 00:56:48.340]   - I think the only reason that you want 3G
[00:56:48.340 --> 00:56:50.300]   is because you want to be able to have access to that.
[00:56:50.300 --> 00:56:53.260]   You want data everywhere and, and, and that's--
[00:56:53.260 --> 00:56:55.300]   - 3G's an option though, not gonna be required.
[00:56:55.300 --> 00:56:56.140]   - It would definitely be an option.
[00:56:56.140 --> 00:56:58.300]   I don't think it would definitely be the norm.
[00:56:58.300 --> 00:57:01.060]   - And I think there are people like you who would pay for it.
[00:57:01.060 --> 00:57:01.900]   - Yes.
[00:57:01.900 --> 00:57:04.820]   (laughing)
[00:57:04.820 --> 00:57:06.460]   - Well, I think we've got a pretty good picture here.
[00:57:06.460 --> 00:57:10.740]   Is this enough, John Gruber, to get people to buy it?
[00:57:10.740 --> 00:57:12.420]   - No, I think we're still missing some.
[00:57:12.420 --> 00:57:15.340]   I mean, I, I, assuming that it's, you know,
[00:57:15.340 --> 00:57:16.780]   that we're not making fools of ourselves
[00:57:16.780 --> 00:57:19.140]   and that it really is coming, you know, later this month
[00:57:19.140 --> 00:57:21.060]   or, you know, announced later this month
[00:57:21.060 --> 00:57:24.820]   and shipping soon, I still think there's something
[00:57:24.820 --> 00:57:27.540]   that's missing, you know, that they've got,
[00:57:27.540 --> 00:57:29.820]   that they've nailed. - Yeah, Dick's flat line says,
[00:57:29.820 --> 00:57:32.140]   oh, it's easy, add home automation.
[00:57:32.140 --> 00:57:33.660]   It's an X10 controller.
[00:57:33.660 --> 00:57:34.740]   - You're like, I don't know.
[00:57:34.740 --> 00:57:37.260]   - Yeah, I absolutely agree with you.
[00:57:37.260 --> 00:57:39.340]   - No, there's gotta be a piece, but what can it be?
[00:57:39.340 --> 00:57:41.420]   - The basic conclusion of my son times piece
[00:57:41.420 --> 00:57:43.700]   is that I think I understand maybe half of it
[00:57:43.700 --> 00:57:44.980]   but I think the other half is going to be
[00:57:44.980 --> 00:57:49.220]   the moments where I'm gonna like, oh, I edit now.
[00:57:49.220 --> 00:57:51.660]   - Isn't it amazing how, mostly it's gonna be user interface.
[00:57:51.660 --> 00:57:53.380]   There's gonna be a new user interface on this
[00:57:53.380 --> 00:57:54.940]   that I would not have been able to guess
[00:57:54.940 --> 00:57:55.780]   at because I've never seen it before.
[00:57:55.780 --> 00:57:59.020]   - It's amazing how we, we, we, we, Apple fans ascribe
[00:57:59.020 --> 00:58:02.180]   Godlike abilities to Johnny Ive and Steve Jobs.
[00:58:02.180 --> 00:58:03.020]   - They, they know.
[00:58:03.020 --> 00:58:04.060]   - They're good, they really are.
[00:58:04.060 --> 00:58:08.260]   I mean, and it's almost like, and I hope I'm not spoiling this
[00:58:08.260 --> 00:58:09.620]   for anybody out there who hasn't seen it,
[00:58:09.620 --> 00:58:14.500]   but like they do every once in a while with technology,
[00:58:14.500 --> 00:58:16.580]   the equivalent of like when you were watching a movie
[00:58:16.580 --> 00:58:19.660]   like the sixth sense and you get to the part, you know,
[00:58:19.660 --> 00:58:22.020]   where they reveal it and then all of a sudden
[00:58:22.020 --> 00:58:23.340]   the light goes on in your head and you're like,
[00:58:23.340 --> 00:58:25.780]   I can't believe I didn't figure that out all along
[00:58:25.780 --> 00:58:27.580]   or the usual suspects or something like that.
[00:58:27.580 --> 00:58:28.420]   - The aha.
[00:58:28.420 --> 00:58:31.620]   - And I just can't help but feel like as I'm watching this
[00:58:31.620 --> 00:58:35.220]   tablet rumor thing unfold that there's something
[00:58:35.220 --> 00:58:37.380]   the clues are there and there's something
[00:58:37.380 --> 00:58:39.220]   that they're gonna reveal and it's gonna be like,
[00:58:39.220 --> 00:58:41.620]   I can't believe I, you know.
[00:58:41.620 --> 00:58:45.820]   - We all, we all not only expect but demand
[00:58:45.820 --> 00:58:47.620]   and aha moment out of this 'cause otherwise
[00:58:47.620 --> 00:58:49.700]   it makes no sense.
[00:58:49.700 --> 00:58:51.420]   - I think, I think with what we've listed it.
[00:58:51.420 --> 00:58:52.340]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:58:52.340 --> 00:58:54.340]   - Couple of, you know, we've had this argument
[00:58:54.340 --> 00:58:56.260]   for a year now 'cause I've been saying,
[00:58:56.260 --> 00:58:57.420]   I don't get it, I don't want it.
[00:58:57.420 --> 00:58:59.260]   - When I was trying to design one, I was trying to build one.
[00:58:59.260 --> 00:59:01.020]   The biggest problem we had with building one by the way
[00:59:01.020 --> 00:59:02.140]   was just the interface.
[00:59:02.140 --> 00:59:03.580]   That was the thing that we--
[00:59:03.580 --> 00:59:06.220]   - Well, if anybody could do a UI that makes you go,
[00:59:06.220 --> 00:59:07.660]   whoa, it's gonna be Apple.
[00:59:07.660 --> 00:59:10.540]   - And by the way, this is just a little bit of a rat hole
[00:59:10.540 --> 00:59:13.700]   but if you wanna see a great interview with Jonathan Ives,
[00:59:13.700 --> 00:59:18.620]   there's a documentary called Objectified
[00:59:18.620 --> 00:59:21.300]   that's kinda floating around on PBS, I think you get it on.
[00:59:21.300 --> 00:59:22.500]   - You know what, and they just,
[00:59:22.500 --> 00:59:26.340]   it just came out yesterday as a rental on iTunes.
[00:59:26.340 --> 00:59:27.940]   - It is, it is so great.
[00:59:27.940 --> 00:59:28.780]   - Let's all get it.
[00:59:28.780 --> 00:59:30.100]   - So great.
[00:59:30.100 --> 00:59:30.940]   - Objectified.
[00:59:30.940 --> 00:59:32.620]   - It's directed by Gary Hustwit
[00:59:32.620 --> 00:59:34.700]   who was the director of the excellent
[00:59:34.700 --> 00:59:35.980]   Helvetica documentary.
[00:59:35.980 --> 00:59:36.820]   - Well, Helvetica.
[00:59:36.820 --> 00:59:37.820]   - I love Helvetica.
[00:59:37.820 --> 00:59:39.860]   - Yeah, it's a great, all,
[00:59:39.860 --> 00:59:42.580]   it's just interviews with great industrial designers.
[00:59:42.580 --> 00:59:43.500]   - Oh, so it's not just Johnny?
[00:59:43.500 --> 00:59:46.420]   - No, no, no, it's a whole group
[00:59:46.420 --> 00:59:48.740]   but it's great to just watch the cogs in his headwork
[00:59:48.740 --> 00:59:49.740]   as he does the interview.
[00:59:49.740 --> 00:59:50.580]   (laughing)
[00:59:50.580 --> 00:59:52.020]   And so, but with all of these,
[00:59:52.020 --> 00:59:53.860]   it's just talking about industrial design
[00:59:53.860 --> 00:59:55.500]   and I'm afraid I'm a geek out.
[00:59:55.500 --> 00:59:56.740]   - If Jonathan Ives did not exist,
[00:59:56.740 --> 00:59:58.860]   we would have had to create him.
[00:59:58.860 --> 01:00:01.260]   - I'm not sure if that Apple didn't create him.
[01:00:01.260 --> 01:00:02.100]   - Yeah.
[01:00:02.100 --> 01:00:02.940]   (laughing)
[01:00:02.940 --> 01:00:04.100]   - The reason why we rarely see him is that
[01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:05.080]   it takes a puppeteer,
[01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:06.820]   a couple of years of seven people
[01:00:06.820 --> 01:00:07.780]   they can never get both ahead
[01:00:07.780 --> 01:00:09.500]   and the body working at the same time.
[01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:11.060]   (laughing)
[01:00:11.060 --> 01:00:13.460]   - It's objectified at 5ED.
[01:00:13.460 --> 01:00:14.460]   - Objectified at 5ED.
[01:00:14.460 --> 01:00:16.620]   I'm just looking at it right now on iTunes.
[01:00:16.620 --> 01:00:19.500]   - And it's, now that you can rent it on iTunes,
[01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:21.900]   I know that it was previously available,
[01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:26.580]   still there on Amazon via Netflix or something like that.
[01:00:26.580 --> 01:00:28.500]   Like it's, now that it's on iTunes,
[01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:33.500]   it's rentable on all the major streaming renting services.
[01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:35.180]   Really, it's definitely,
[01:00:35.180 --> 01:00:36.740]   I second the recommendation.
[01:00:36.740 --> 01:00:38.180]   It's really, really good movie.
[01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:40.020]   - Well, we're getting to our picks.
[01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:42.380]   Don't waste your picks, kids.
[01:00:42.380 --> 01:00:43.860]   I'm gonna pick a objectified.
[01:00:43.860 --> 01:00:46.140]   (laughing)
[01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:48.900]   - Lee was obviously very prepared before this year.
[01:00:48.900 --> 01:00:50.140]   - What am I gonna pick?
[01:00:50.140 --> 01:00:51.860]   Well, you got a minute to think about it.
[01:00:51.860 --> 01:00:53.020]   We're gonna come back and just say.
[01:00:53.020 --> 01:00:54.980]   - But then I'm gonna pick Apple's tablet.
[01:00:54.980 --> 01:00:56.740]   - Yeah. (laughing)
[01:00:56.740 --> 01:00:58.020]   - Well, actually that's a good question.
[01:00:58.020 --> 01:00:59.660]   - I'm gonna pick the thing that you guys
[01:00:59.660 --> 01:01:00.700]   haven't even heard rumor about
[01:01:00.700 --> 01:01:02.140]   that coming out with after the tablet.
[01:01:02.140 --> 01:01:04.060]   - Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, but I can't talk about it
[01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:05.300]   because I didn't see. - I think that too.
[01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:06.700]   - Yeah, I was gonna pick that.
[01:01:06.700 --> 01:01:09.700]   So that was a question I saw in "Friend Feed"
[01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:11.180]   or Facebook or somewhere the other day.
[01:01:11.180 --> 01:01:13.940]   I think Kevin Rose posed it.
[01:01:13.940 --> 01:01:17.420]   If you could order right now,
[01:01:17.420 --> 01:01:21.580]   whatever it is, sight unseen without knowing what it is,
[01:01:21.580 --> 01:01:22.580]   would you? - Yes.
[01:01:24.940 --> 01:01:25.780]   - Andy Inako.
[01:01:25.780 --> 01:01:30.740]   - I'm sorry, what was the second proof?
[01:01:30.740 --> 01:01:31.660]   - You've been saving up.
[01:01:31.660 --> 01:01:33.700]   If you could, I know you have a little,
[01:01:33.700 --> 01:01:36.100]   I was pasting in my pick of the week URL
[01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:37.100]   that you could have, that I was--
[01:01:37.100 --> 01:01:39.700]   - I know you have a piggy bank filled with seven or $800.
[01:01:39.700 --> 01:01:41.220]   - Oh, God.
[01:01:41.220 --> 01:01:44.620]   - If you could buy this thing, sight unseen today, would you?
[01:01:44.620 --> 01:01:47.300]   - If I could have a day of release, I think I would.
[01:01:47.300 --> 01:01:51.300]   And only because I'm an Apple fan,
[01:01:51.300 --> 01:01:53.100]   but because I know I'm gonna be riding
[01:01:53.100 --> 01:01:55.660]   at least $600 worth of stuff about it.
[01:01:55.660 --> 01:01:58.180]   - Yeah, we're not a good test.
[01:01:58.180 --> 01:01:59.020]   We're not a good test.
[01:01:59.020 --> 01:02:01.860]   - Let's say you're not Mr. Chicago sometimes.
[01:02:01.860 --> 01:02:04.420]   - If I'm not Mr. Chicago sometimes, no,
[01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:06.900]   because I'm not in the sort of financial league
[01:02:06.900 --> 01:02:08.980]   where I can afford to gamble $600 on something
[01:02:08.980 --> 01:02:09.820]   I've never seen before.
[01:02:09.820 --> 01:02:10.660]   - I know what Andy.
[01:02:10.660 --> 01:02:11.820]   - I don't even like going to see a movie
[01:02:11.820 --> 01:02:14.020]   that I know nothing about with the cause 10 and a half dollars.
[01:02:14.020 --> 01:02:15.540]   - I know what Andy was doing.
[01:02:15.540 --> 01:02:18.780]   He was registering IslateUnloaded.com.
[01:02:18.780 --> 01:02:21.780]   I know what you're up to.
[01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:23.700]   - Thank you, and I'm gonna have to register it for real,
[01:02:23.700 --> 01:02:25.740]   because someone's gonna try to speak me to it.
[01:02:25.740 --> 01:02:27.700]   I know that's 33, thank you so much.
[01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:29.100]   (laughing)
[01:02:29.100 --> 01:02:30.780]   How do my eyes slide off a little?
[01:02:30.780 --> 01:02:32.620]   What a holy--
[01:02:32.620 --> 01:02:34.540]   - John Grover, would you order and buy today
[01:02:34.540 --> 01:02:36.460]   put your money where your mouth is?
[01:02:36.460 --> 01:02:37.300]   - Oh, I'm an idiot.
[01:02:37.300 --> 01:02:38.540]   - Yeah, me too.
[01:02:38.540 --> 01:02:39.860]   We'd all do it, except for Andy,
[01:02:39.860 --> 01:02:42.580]   who is gonna do it anyway.
[01:02:42.580 --> 01:02:44.780]   - He knows he'd do it.
[01:02:44.780 --> 01:02:46.900]   - He has to, it's a occupational hazard.
[01:02:46.900 --> 01:02:47.740]   - And I do too.
[01:02:47.740 --> 01:02:49.940]   - That's my argument.
[01:02:49.940 --> 01:02:50.780]   - Somebody asked me--
[01:02:50.780 --> 01:02:51.620]   - I'm gonna get to it.
[01:02:51.620 --> 01:02:53.060]   - There's this site, this cookie site called
[01:02:53.060 --> 01:02:55.220]   formspring.me, I don't know where it came from,
[01:02:55.220 --> 01:02:56.700]   and now I wish I hadn't signed up for it,
[01:02:56.700 --> 01:02:58.700]   but you get to, people get to ask you questions
[01:02:58.700 --> 01:03:01.260]   on this site, just any question at all.
[01:03:01.260 --> 01:03:04.380]   And I've over a thousand questions now
[01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:05.580]   that I have to answer.
[01:03:05.580 --> 01:03:07.700]   (laughing)
[01:03:07.700 --> 01:03:09.780]   'Cause I said, oh, ask me anything on Twitter,
[01:03:09.780 --> 01:03:11.380]   that was stupid, but one of the questions is,
[01:03:11.380 --> 01:03:12.220]   do you like Kool-Aid?
[01:03:12.220 --> 01:03:14.620]   And I said only if it's apple flavored baby.
[01:03:14.620 --> 01:03:15.460]   And I have--
[01:03:15.460 --> 01:03:16.300]   (laughing)
[01:03:16.300 --> 01:03:17.380]   - And I have drunk.
[01:03:17.380 --> 01:03:19.260]   - I have drunk of the cup of knowledge.
[01:03:19.260 --> 01:03:21.860]   - I think it's the way you get people to drink the Kool-Aid
[01:03:21.860 --> 01:03:24.260]   is that you keep on producing something that they want.
[01:03:24.260 --> 01:03:26.420]   I mean, it's not like I bought the iPhone
[01:03:26.420 --> 01:03:28.100]   and then now look at it and go, well,
[01:03:28.100 --> 01:03:29.140]   I thought it was gonna be great,
[01:03:29.140 --> 01:03:30.100]   now it's a piece of crap.
[01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:32.780]   - No, you're right, if we had been burned a few times.
[01:03:32.780 --> 01:03:34.220]   - Yeah.
[01:03:34.220 --> 01:03:36.380]   - Right, it's like, with James Cameron,
[01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:37.940]   where once you have a couple of--
[01:03:37.940 --> 01:03:38.860]   - We gave him a chance.
[01:03:38.860 --> 01:03:40.180]   - That's right.
[01:03:40.180 --> 01:03:44.180]   - I haven't seen Avatar yet, but I'm going to,
[01:03:44.180 --> 01:03:46.540]   and I've been in a black hole,
[01:03:46.540 --> 01:03:48.260]   tried to be as spoiler free as possible,
[01:03:48.260 --> 01:03:50.180]   but I would have gone to see it, you know?
[01:03:50.180 --> 01:03:52.180]   No matter what anybody else.
[01:03:52.180 --> 01:03:54.940]   - Okay, I'm gonna tell you, the aliens are dead people.
[01:03:54.940 --> 01:03:55.900]   (laughing)
[01:03:55.900 --> 01:03:57.260]   - Yeah, yeah, it's a shocker.
[01:03:57.260 --> 01:03:59.300]   It's a real twist right at the end there.
[01:03:59.300 --> 01:04:00.700]   - The one thing that I should,
[01:04:00.700 --> 01:04:03.260]   that we should say to get us all back rounded is that,
[01:04:03.260 --> 01:04:06.580]   you know, just remember Apple TV.
[01:04:06.580 --> 01:04:09.660]   It was, if you had imagined three for years ago,
[01:04:09.660 --> 01:04:12.780]   Apple's gonna come up with an HD like set top box
[01:04:12.780 --> 01:04:14.260]   that will deliver all kinds of media,
[01:04:14.260 --> 01:04:15.740]   integrate your iTunes library.
[01:04:15.740 --> 01:04:17.380]   We would not have thought, oh,
[01:04:17.380 --> 01:04:20.260]   so it's just a gray box you plug into your TV
[01:04:20.260 --> 01:04:22.580]   that lets you stream music and stuff from you.
[01:04:22.580 --> 01:04:23.660]   Really?
[01:04:23.660 --> 01:04:25.100]   - Yeah, you know, I bet the next person
[01:04:25.100 --> 01:04:25.940]   in the software would be great.
[01:04:25.940 --> 01:04:26.780]   No, really?
[01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:27.620]   - No.
[01:04:27.620 --> 01:04:28.460]   - Well, third person in the software would be great.
[01:04:28.460 --> 01:04:30.100]   - It's gotta get better someday.
[01:04:30.100 --> 01:04:33.460]   - That's a great point though, and I sort of think,
[01:04:33.460 --> 01:04:35.780]   I mean, the four of us are all, you know,
[01:04:35.780 --> 01:04:39.380]   willing to go hyperventilation level code red
[01:04:39.380 --> 01:04:41.860]   on the tablet speculation,
[01:04:41.860 --> 01:04:44.660]   but I think in general, over all,
[01:04:44.660 --> 01:04:47.180]   everybody is anticipating this,
[01:04:47.180 --> 01:04:50.940]   but I think expectations are very reasonable overall.
[01:04:50.940 --> 01:04:53.140]   Like people who, you know, there's so much speculation
[01:04:53.140 --> 01:04:56.660]   that it's just an e-reader or just something.
[01:04:56.660 --> 01:04:59.660]   And I think part of that is fueled by Apple TV
[01:04:59.660 --> 01:05:04.660]   that, you know, as a very pedestrian, humble,
[01:05:04.660 --> 01:05:08.980]   not mind-blowing product that Apple came out with,
[01:05:08.980 --> 01:05:10.980]   that, you know, that people are sort of,
[01:05:10.980 --> 01:05:12.340]   there's a lot of people who I think are saying,
[01:05:12.340 --> 01:05:14.060]   yeah, Apple's gonna climb up the tablet,
[01:05:14.060 --> 01:05:17.620]   but whose expectations I think are Apple TV level
[01:05:17.620 --> 01:05:19.500]   rather than iPhone level.
[01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:21.700]   - Yeah.
[01:05:21.700 --> 01:05:24.260]   - I think though, I'm going with iPhone level.
[01:05:24.260 --> 01:05:26.380]   - I agree.
[01:05:26.380 --> 01:05:27.660]   - iPhone level?
[01:05:27.660 --> 01:05:28.860]   - iPhone level?
[01:05:28.860 --> 01:05:29.700]   - iPhone level?
[01:05:29.700 --> 01:05:30.780]   - iPhone level.
[01:05:30.780 --> 01:05:31.860]   - We're all in agreement.
[01:05:31.860 --> 01:05:32.700]   - It's gotta be.
[01:05:32.700 --> 01:05:35.580]   - Well, and one difference, the thing that I think
[01:05:35.580 --> 01:05:37.860]   holds Apple TV back more than anything else,
[01:05:37.860 --> 01:05:40.380]   is that the whole premise of the thing
[01:05:40.380 --> 01:05:42.140]   is that you're watching,
[01:05:42.140 --> 01:05:47.140]   and not to put YouTube and other sources of user-generated
[01:05:47.140 --> 01:05:49.020]   and video podcasts and stuff,
[01:05:49.020 --> 01:05:51.180]   not to denigrate them,
[01:05:51.180 --> 01:05:53.980]   but primarily it's about watching feature motion pictures
[01:05:53.980 --> 01:05:56.020]   from major studios and watching,
[01:05:56.020 --> 01:05:59.740]   you know, big-time broadcast TV shows.
[01:05:59.740 --> 01:06:03.580]   And so, Apple is at the mercy of the sort of content deals
[01:06:03.580 --> 01:06:06.380]   that they can get out of major TV and cable networks
[01:06:06.380 --> 01:06:08.340]   and the movie studios.
[01:06:08.340 --> 01:06:09.740]   And, you know, if you've ever, like,
[01:06:09.740 --> 01:06:11.980]   I use my Apple TV all the time and I rent movies there,
[01:06:11.980 --> 01:06:14.660]   but sometimes I'm flabbergasted that the movies
[01:06:14.660 --> 01:06:15.900]   you can't get on.
[01:06:15.900 --> 01:06:17.820]   It's, you know, like you couldn't,
[01:06:17.820 --> 01:06:21.660]   the world's worst corner video store has a better selection
[01:06:21.660 --> 01:06:23.460]   of movies than Apple TV.
[01:06:23.460 --> 01:06:24.620]   And it's not Apple's fault.
[01:06:24.620 --> 01:06:25.580]   I think it said, you know,
[01:06:25.580 --> 01:06:28.140]   I think that they would publish as many movies as they can get.
[01:06:28.140 --> 01:06:30.540]   It's the studios, that they're sort of reluctant
[01:06:30.540 --> 01:06:34.980]   to let Apple dominate video like they do music.
[01:06:34.980 --> 01:06:36.700]   - Maybe because, you know, the funny thing
[01:06:36.700 --> 01:06:37.900]   I always think about that is that
[01:06:37.900 --> 01:06:41.260]   I get that they're reluctant to let Apple dominate video
[01:06:41.260 --> 01:06:44.420]   the way they dominate music because when they dominated music,
[01:06:44.420 --> 01:06:47.620]   it did so much damage to the music industry, right?
[01:06:47.620 --> 01:06:48.940]   - Oh.
[01:06:48.940 --> 01:06:50.900]   - I mean, you know, the thing is these guys are idiots.
[01:06:50.900 --> 01:06:51.740]   - They're idiots.
[01:06:51.740 --> 01:06:54.060]   - You know, they want to be protected.
[01:06:54.060 --> 01:06:55.340]   - We want to be hulu.
[01:06:55.340 --> 01:06:57.660]   - What they really need to be protected from themselves
[01:06:57.660 --> 01:06:59.820]   because they have their heads jumped so far up
[01:06:59.820 --> 01:07:01.900]   or dark hole that they have no idea
[01:07:01.900 --> 01:07:03.780]   which way is right left up or down.
[01:07:03.780 --> 01:07:05.900]   - So isn't it, I think it's an interesting contrast too
[01:07:05.900 --> 01:07:08.900]   on that and I think the tablet hypothetically plays
[01:07:08.900 --> 01:07:12.100]   into this in terms of what kind of deals Apple can get.
[01:07:12.100 --> 01:07:13.700]   It's so you've got the music industry.
[01:07:13.700 --> 01:07:15.580]   Let's divide the whole media world in three.
[01:07:15.580 --> 01:07:19.180]   Music, TV and video, and then third would be print,
[01:07:19.180 --> 01:07:20.140]   traditional print.
[01:07:20.140 --> 01:07:22.420]   So music's already been iTunesified.
[01:07:22.420 --> 01:07:25.900]   Video, the TV and movie people,
[01:07:25.900 --> 01:07:28.460]   I think they're looking at Apple and iTunes.
[01:07:28.460 --> 01:07:32.340]   They sort of like, we don't want that to happen to us.
[01:07:32.340 --> 01:07:35.060]   Whereas the print people are saying we would love,
[01:07:35.060 --> 01:07:37.500]   we would absolutely love, please Apple,
[01:07:37.500 --> 01:07:39.300]   please do to us what you've done to music.
[01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:41.700]   - Well it's 'cause they're in the same position music was in.
[01:07:41.700 --> 01:07:42.860]   They are dying.
[01:07:42.860 --> 01:07:44.340]   And so the thing is that Apple--
[01:07:44.340 --> 01:07:46.460]   - Because people aren't paying for content.
[01:07:46.460 --> 01:07:48.620]   - Right, so the issue that they have is that
[01:07:48.620 --> 01:07:50.820]   the video folks are still making some money.
[01:07:50.820 --> 01:07:52.300]   The print guys are going out of business.
[01:07:52.300 --> 01:07:54.780]   They're like, whatever you throw into the water,
[01:07:54.780 --> 01:07:56.580]   we're gonna grab onto because we don't have a choice
[01:07:56.580 --> 01:07:57.420]   at this point.
[01:07:57.420 --> 01:07:58.580]   That's where the music industry was when Apple
[01:07:58.580 --> 01:08:00.540]   threw the preserver.
[01:08:00.540 --> 01:08:03.460]   - I'm sure that Robert Murdoch sees Steve Jobs as a savior.
[01:08:03.460 --> 01:08:07.020]   I mean, please help me get people to pay for this somehow.
[01:08:07.020 --> 01:08:09.900]   - Well also it's also an interesting way that Apple
[01:08:09.900 --> 01:08:12.180]   seems to have learned that they can make a lot of money
[01:08:12.180 --> 01:08:15.380]   by creating a planet in which the state sales tax is 30%
[01:08:15.380 --> 01:08:16.780]   and they get to keep all of it.
[01:08:16.780 --> 01:08:19.780]   And people who decide to move to that planet realize
[01:08:19.780 --> 01:08:22.460]   that if they create products,
[01:08:22.460 --> 01:08:27.180]   they just keeping 70% of potentially a lot of money
[01:08:27.180 --> 01:08:28.940]   is a very, very good deal for them,
[01:08:28.940 --> 01:08:31.380]   given that how efficient the government is
[01:08:31.380 --> 01:08:33.860]   at taking money from its citizens.
[01:08:33.860 --> 01:08:37.660]   So I think that it could be carved a brand new world
[01:08:37.660 --> 01:08:40.660]   inside this device in which it's very, very easy
[01:08:40.660 --> 01:08:44.100]   as a content provider to put apps, books, music,
[01:08:44.100 --> 01:08:44.980]   anything on it.
[01:08:44.980 --> 01:08:48.220]   And Apple will simply say, we'll let you do whatever you want,
[01:08:48.220 --> 01:08:49.780]   give us 30 cents and we'll help you promote it,
[01:08:49.780 --> 01:08:52.260]   we'll help you sell it, we'll all be very, very fat and happy.
[01:08:52.260 --> 01:08:54.380]   - I also think that when you talk about adding value
[01:08:54.380 --> 01:08:56.460]   and being able to charge for your content,
[01:08:56.460 --> 01:08:59.940]   a device that plays video, adds audio, adds all those things.
[01:08:59.940 --> 01:09:00.980]   Yeah, you can go up to our website,
[01:09:00.980 --> 01:09:02.740]   you can go up to the New York Times and read the articles,
[01:09:02.740 --> 01:09:05.020]   but you're not gonna get the enhanced experience.
[01:09:05.020 --> 01:09:07.020]   You're not gonna get all the things that we have there.
[01:09:07.020 --> 01:09:09.020]   I think that's a great way for them to start adding,
[01:09:09.020 --> 01:09:11.100]   adding more value and charging for it.
[01:09:11.100 --> 01:09:12.380]   - Well also, it's also, it's the idea
[01:09:12.380 --> 01:09:15.580]   of you're not getting one micro slice of the New York Times,
[01:09:15.580 --> 01:09:17.780]   we will give you the entire New York Times
[01:09:17.780 --> 01:09:19.820]   on your device instantly accessible,
[01:09:19.820 --> 01:09:21.580]   easy to get from one place to another
[01:09:21.580 --> 01:09:22.580]   at a worthy level. - Is the world ready
[01:09:22.580 --> 01:09:25.100]   for a bunch of subscriptions like that?
[01:09:25.100 --> 01:09:28.340]   I mean, are people starting to get subscription fatigue?
[01:09:28.340 --> 01:09:30.100]   - We used to subscribe, we used to subscribe
[01:09:30.100 --> 01:09:30.940]   to all these magazines, I mean,
[01:09:30.940 --> 01:09:32.740]   - Subscribe to The Economist in Macworld.
[01:09:32.740 --> 01:09:35.380]   - I think Apple might have a bundle price.
[01:09:35.380 --> 01:09:36.580]   That's what they were talking about with TV,
[01:09:36.580 --> 01:09:40.460]   and I think that would be also a very compelling product.
[01:09:40.460 --> 01:09:42.100]   I mean, we poo poo subscriptions,
[01:09:42.100 --> 01:09:46.140]   but how many of us happily pay for a Netflix subscription?
[01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:49.500]   Even though-- - No, and I think that it,
[01:09:49.500 --> 01:09:50.820]   you compare it to the apps,
[01:09:50.820 --> 01:09:52.900]   like where I think everybody was on an iPhone
[01:09:52.900 --> 01:09:56.260]   or an iPod touch is buys, I buy more apps.
[01:09:56.260 --> 01:09:58.060]   It's not just the 99 cent price,
[01:09:58.060 --> 01:10:01.660]   it's the, I don't have to end my credit card
[01:10:01.660 --> 01:10:04.740]   and the expiration date and the secret three digit thing,
[01:10:04.740 --> 01:10:08.540]   which by now is not a secret, it's centralized, right?
[01:10:08.540 --> 01:10:09.940]   I mean, I think that's the difference.
[01:10:09.940 --> 01:10:15.100]   Where a subscription to 10 magazines through iTunes
[01:10:15.100 --> 01:10:16.580]   is gonna be a lot easier to manage
[01:10:16.580 --> 01:10:19.860]   than 10 separate individual subscriptions
[01:10:19.860 --> 01:10:22.540]   in the pre-tablet world.
[01:10:22.540 --> 01:10:26.100]   - We're gonna be back with more in just a bit.
[01:10:26.100 --> 01:10:29.580]   We're talking with John Gruber of DaringFireball.net.
[01:10:29.580 --> 01:10:32.900]   - Great Apple blog, must read for anybody who follows Apple
[01:10:32.900 --> 01:10:34.900]   and the NOTCO, the Chicago Sun Times
[01:10:34.900 --> 01:10:37.620]   and the Celestial Waste of Ben with CWOB.com
[01:10:37.620 --> 01:10:40.140]   and Alex Lindsey of the Pixel Core.
[01:10:40.140 --> 01:10:41.740]   We're going to CES tomorrow,
[01:10:41.740 --> 01:10:43.140]   we're packing everything up right after,
[01:10:43.140 --> 01:10:45.420]   wait a minute, today we're packing everything up
[01:10:45.420 --> 01:10:46.940]   right after the show.
[01:10:46.940 --> 01:10:50.500]   In fact, I think later on in the afternoon,
[01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:52.020]   there'll only be one camera left.
[01:10:52.020 --> 01:10:53.180]   (laughing)
[01:10:53.180 --> 01:10:54.620]   I'm sorry, this is gonna be a one camera shoot
[01:10:54.620 --> 01:10:56.860]   because everything's getting in the box and going
[01:10:56.860 --> 01:10:59.700]   and starting Wednesday evening,
[01:10:59.700 --> 01:11:02.200]   our first interview is with the CEO of Ford,
[01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:04.660]   which I'm very excited about.
[01:11:04.660 --> 01:11:06.660]   Starting Wednesday evening, we are gonna be,
[01:11:06.660 --> 01:11:08.340]   we are gonna be on the ground
[01:11:08.340 --> 01:11:10.660]   and running and gunning and covering CES
[01:11:10.660 --> 01:11:12.060]   in a way that's never been covered before.
[01:11:12.060 --> 01:11:14.300]   Colleen has built a remote live rig
[01:11:14.300 --> 01:11:18.740]   that lets us broadcast using high speed 3G and 4G cards
[01:11:18.740 --> 01:11:21.780]   anywhere including a cab, including the fountains
[01:11:21.780 --> 01:11:23.700]   the Bellagio anywhere.
[01:11:23.700 --> 01:11:26.660]   If I happen to take off my clothes
[01:11:26.660 --> 01:11:27.780]   and jump in those fountains,
[01:11:27.780 --> 01:11:30.620]   you will see it live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:11:30.620 --> 01:11:31.460]   Not much to do.
[01:11:31.460 --> 01:11:32.820]   - And boys and girls, we know what we mean,
[01:11:32.820 --> 01:11:34.660]   but when we say it, it.
[01:11:34.660 --> 01:11:35.660]   (laughing)
[01:11:35.660 --> 01:11:37.500]   Whether it's live is another question.
[01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:39.500]   (laughing)
[01:11:39.500 --> 01:11:42.740]   We also, we have a title, oh dear.
[01:11:42.740 --> 01:11:47.380]   And we also will be doing the big press events,
[01:11:47.380 --> 01:11:48.780]   showstoppers and digital experience
[01:11:48.780 --> 01:11:51.780]   where the press gets to eat giant jumbo shrimp
[01:11:51.780 --> 01:11:54.140]   and drink from chocolate fountains.
[01:11:54.140 --> 01:12:00.580]   And while they're regaled by various high paying clientele
[01:12:00.580 --> 01:12:01.780]   to show them their products,
[01:12:01.780 --> 01:12:02.780]   it will show you the actual,
[01:12:02.780 --> 01:12:05.380]   what it's like to be a wine and nine is a,
[01:12:05.380 --> 01:12:06.860]   the last place you can still get wine
[01:12:06.860 --> 01:12:08.660]   and nine is a media maven.
[01:12:08.660 --> 01:12:11.580]   We'll also be doing live all day coverage Friday, Saturday
[01:12:11.580 --> 01:12:14.780]   and Sunday including the radio show Twig and Twit.
[01:12:14.780 --> 01:12:17.780]   And many of our other shows will be there.
[01:12:17.780 --> 01:12:20.340]   I wanna thank our friends at Sync
[01:12:20.340 --> 01:12:21.700]   for making this all possible.
[01:12:21.700 --> 01:12:23.700]   Sync is the new system available exclusively
[01:12:23.700 --> 01:12:25.340]   in Ford, Lincoln and Mercury vehicles.
[01:12:25.340 --> 01:12:26.420]   And I know a lot of people have said,
[01:12:26.420 --> 01:12:30.340]   where is my third party, you know, add on Sync?
[01:12:30.340 --> 01:12:31.620]   And I wish they did have such a thing,
[01:12:31.620 --> 01:12:32.460]   but no, you've my friends,
[01:12:32.460 --> 01:12:34.500]   you've gotta go to your Ford, Lincoln and Mercury dealer
[01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:37.500]   and you've gotta say, I want my Sync and it is awesome.
[01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:40.660]   It's enough truthfully to buy a Ford, Lincoln
[01:12:40.660 --> 01:12:41.500]   and Mercury vehicle.
[01:12:41.500 --> 01:12:44.660]   We've got the Lincoln MKT is pulling up right outside
[01:12:44.660 --> 01:12:46.660]   as we speak, we're just start packing it up.
[01:12:46.660 --> 01:12:48.580]   It's got the great Sync in it.
[01:12:48.580 --> 01:12:49.940]   Well, in fact, later this afternoon,
[01:12:49.940 --> 01:12:54.220]   we'll be talking via Sync as we go down the road
[01:12:54.220 --> 01:12:56.220]   on the way to Vegas.
[01:12:56.220 --> 01:12:58.020]   I feel like hoping Crosby,
[01:12:58.020 --> 01:13:01.220]   we're off on the road to Las Vegas.
[01:13:01.220 --> 01:13:02.380]   Sync is the hands free.
[01:13:02.380 --> 01:13:06.060]   So we care about the safety of our driver.
[01:13:06.060 --> 01:13:08.700]   So he's gonna use the Sync to make calls on his mobile phone
[01:13:08.700 --> 01:13:10.540]   to find and play music and podcasts
[01:13:10.540 --> 01:13:12.060]   to get turned by turn navigation
[01:13:12.060 --> 01:13:12.900]   so he doesn't get lost,
[01:13:12.900 --> 01:13:14.780]   he can access real-time traffic information
[01:13:14.780 --> 01:13:17.580]   so he knows what's going on in the road ahead,
[01:13:17.580 --> 01:13:21.340]   weather, business listings, ski reports.
[01:13:21.340 --> 01:13:22.740]   I hope he's not going skiing.
[01:13:22.740 --> 01:13:25.740]   Sports scores, even fantasy league scores.
[01:13:25.740 --> 01:13:27.940]   And 911 assists should the airbags deploy?
[01:13:27.940 --> 01:13:29.220]   We'll know.
[01:13:29.220 --> 01:13:31.940]   GPS information is sent directly to 911
[01:13:31.940 --> 01:13:34.580]   so you get emergency help as quickly as you need it.
[01:13:34.580 --> 01:13:36.980]   Vehicle health reports to all hands free from Sync.
[01:13:36.980 --> 01:13:38.180]   That means you keep your eyes on the road,
[01:13:38.180 --> 01:13:40.140]   your hands on the wheel,
[01:13:40.140 --> 01:13:42.260]   humming along on your way down to Vegas.
[01:13:42.260 --> 01:13:45.380]   Sync and Ford are getting three honors at CES.
[01:13:45.380 --> 01:13:49.740]   2010, an in-dash computer
[01:13:49.740 --> 01:13:52.500]   for Ford's commercial truck and van division.
[01:13:52.500 --> 01:13:54.380]   One best of innovations in the category
[01:13:54.380 --> 01:13:56.100]   of in-vehicle accessories.
[01:13:56.100 --> 01:13:59.580]   The 2010 Forest was honored as the official car of CES
[01:13:59.580 --> 01:14:01.820]   because of 10 amazing things in the,
[01:14:01.820 --> 01:14:04.540]   to us including the Sync.
[01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:06.380]   Also, Sync was honored in the CES Design
[01:14:06.380 --> 01:14:07.780]   and Engineering Awards category
[01:14:07.780 --> 01:14:08.860]   of the in-vehicle navigation,
[01:14:08.860 --> 01:14:10.820]   telematics and intelligent transportation system
[01:14:10.820 --> 01:14:13.700]   for their traffic directions and information application.
[01:14:13.700 --> 01:14:14.940]   We're gonna know a lot more.
[01:14:14.940 --> 01:14:16.340]   There's some new stuff coming down the road
[01:14:16.340 --> 01:14:17.180]   and we'll cover it.
[01:14:17.180 --> 01:14:19.820]   As I said, we're talking to the CEO for tomorrow afternoon.
[01:14:19.820 --> 01:14:22.300]   SyncMyRide.com, if you wanna know more about Sync,
[01:14:22.300 --> 01:14:24.340]   there's some great videos there, illustrating it.
[01:14:24.340 --> 01:14:27.420]   And stay tuned to Twitch for the next five or six days.
[01:14:27.420 --> 01:14:29.420]   You're gonna learn about Sync and everything new
[01:14:29.420 --> 01:14:31.860]   and exciting at CES thanks to our friends at Sync.
[01:14:31.860 --> 01:14:33.220]   And don't forget to go to your Ford,
[01:14:33.220 --> 01:14:35.380]   Lincoln or Mercury dealer to test out.
[01:14:35.380 --> 01:14:38.820]   Ford, Lincoln, Mercury, Sync.
[01:14:38.820 --> 01:14:42.140]   It's as amazing as I have described it.
[01:14:42.140 --> 01:14:44.340]   Trust me, I was driving the,
[01:14:44.340 --> 01:14:48.340]   I had a little mishap under your Z.
[01:14:48.340 --> 01:14:51.180]   I have a friend, a younger friend
[01:14:51.180 --> 01:14:52.820]   who was doing the splits on the dance floor
[01:14:52.820 --> 01:14:53.660]   and I was a little happy.
[01:14:53.660 --> 01:14:55.420]   I wasn't drunk but I was in a good mood
[01:14:55.420 --> 01:14:57.340]   and I attempted a split.
[01:14:57.340 --> 01:15:02.340]   Yeah, with exactly the result you would think.
[01:15:02.340 --> 01:15:06.140]   Excruciating agony in my left leg.
[01:15:06.140 --> 01:15:08.300]   Now, unfortunately, and I'm still limping
[01:15:08.300 --> 01:15:12.460]   and I have no, every time I try to, that's bad.
[01:15:12.460 --> 01:15:15.220]   I'm not in a cast but I should be probably.
[01:15:15.220 --> 01:15:17.900]   But there is a side effect I did not anticipate.
[01:15:17.900 --> 01:15:19.980]   I cannot shift a clutch pedal.
[01:15:19.980 --> 01:15:22.860]   So I'm not driving my car.
[01:15:22.860 --> 01:15:23.700]   I can't drive it.
[01:15:23.700 --> 01:15:25.860]   So I don't have the sync, I'm driving the old Lexus
[01:15:25.860 --> 01:15:26.860]   'cause it's automatic, right?
[01:15:26.860 --> 01:15:28.220]   I can't do an manual car
[01:15:28.220 --> 01:15:29.620]   'cause I can't shift with my left leg.
[01:15:29.620 --> 01:15:33.340]   It's like, it's twinges when I press the pedal.
[01:15:33.340 --> 01:15:35.700]   So I missed this, I now really appreciate the sync.
[01:15:35.700 --> 01:15:36.540]   I missed it.
[01:15:37.540 --> 01:15:40.340]   Any other quick stories we wanna get to,
[01:15:40.340 --> 01:15:42.860]   three billion served, John says this
[01:15:42.860 --> 01:15:45.300]   in his daring fireball piece.
[01:15:45.300 --> 01:15:48.700]   Apple has announced the three billionth download
[01:15:48.700 --> 01:15:50.020]   from the App Store.
[01:15:50.020 --> 01:15:51.220]   They didn't, you know, they made such a big deal
[01:15:51.220 --> 01:15:53.820]   about the billionth which was bump.
[01:15:53.820 --> 01:15:54.660]   Yeah.
[01:15:54.660 --> 01:15:56.060]   18 months, three billion.
[01:15:56.060 --> 01:15:57.820]   Steve Jobs in a press release says,
[01:15:57.820 --> 01:16:01.100]   "This is like nothing we've ever seen before."
[01:16:01.100 --> 01:16:04.220]   You know, look at, as a CEO, I could tell you right now,
[01:16:04.220 --> 01:16:06.340]   I have minions who write these.
[01:16:06.340 --> 01:16:08.020]   I don't write these.
[01:16:08.020 --> 01:16:10.060]   And I have a feeling Steve's minions wrote,
[01:16:10.060 --> 01:16:12.140]   quote, "The revolutionary App Store offers
[01:16:12.140 --> 01:16:14.100]   "eye-foted iPod touch users an experience
[01:16:14.100 --> 01:16:16.340]   "unlike anything else available on the other mobile devices."
[01:16:16.340 --> 01:16:17.820]   And we see no signs of the competition
[01:16:17.820 --> 01:16:19.580]   catching up anytime soon.
[01:16:19.580 --> 01:16:20.980]   I mean, you need--
[01:16:20.980 --> 01:16:24.500]   I think you'd be very surprised at how carefully those quotes
[01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:29.140]   in an Apple PR are every single word is a subset store.
[01:16:29.140 --> 01:16:29.940]   Oh, I'm sure that's true,
[01:16:29.940 --> 01:16:33.340]   but I don't think Steve originated any of those words.
[01:16:33.340 --> 01:16:34.740]   You might, I'm sure he saw them.
[01:16:34.740 --> 01:16:36.980]   I don't know.
[01:16:36.980 --> 01:16:38.620]   Again, not to, it's, you know,
[01:16:38.620 --> 01:16:40.460]   I've often said that writing about Apple
[01:16:40.460 --> 01:16:43.740]   is like being a criminalologist from the old Cold War
[01:16:43.740 --> 01:16:45.700]   where you've got to, you know,
[01:16:45.700 --> 01:16:49.340]   you get your copy of "Proveda" over in the Western world
[01:16:49.340 --> 01:16:51.260]   and you start like reading between the lines
[01:16:51.260 --> 01:16:53.620]   of the news stories to see what's really going on.
[01:16:53.620 --> 01:16:56.620]   Why is State Television airing Alexander Nevsky today?
[01:16:56.620 --> 01:16:57.460]   Are they playing?
[01:16:57.460 --> 01:16:58.460]   Exactly.
[01:16:58.460 --> 01:16:59.300]   Right.
[01:16:59.300 --> 01:17:01.100]   Who's standing next to Chris Jeff on the podium?
[01:17:01.100 --> 01:17:03.460]   Oh my God, there's been a complete shakeup
[01:17:03.460 --> 01:17:05.380]   at the Pulitzer for the world.
[01:17:05.380 --> 01:17:09.100]   So I can't help but think that on the day,
[01:17:09.100 --> 01:17:11.540]   it's, in number one, it's before CES.
[01:17:11.540 --> 01:17:14.420]   And Apple, you know, traditionally because of Macworld's
[01:17:14.420 --> 01:17:18.620]   previous timing, like to make big announcements before CES.
[01:17:18.620 --> 01:17:20.780]   And it's the day that happened to announce
[01:17:20.780 --> 01:17:23.300]   the three billionth download for mobile phones
[01:17:23.300 --> 01:17:26.780]   on the day that Google releases their biggest Android
[01:17:26.780 --> 01:17:28.460]   handset today.
[01:17:28.460 --> 01:17:30.180]   And it says--
[01:17:30.180 --> 01:17:33.340]   And those signs of the competition catching up
[01:17:33.340 --> 01:17:35.500]   any time soon.
[01:17:35.500 --> 01:17:39.980]   So my bloviating over the top read way too much
[01:17:39.980 --> 01:17:44.420]   into 12 words interpretation is that it's Apple's way
[01:17:44.420 --> 01:17:47.460]   of saying Android Pasha.
[01:17:47.460 --> 01:17:49.740]   Yeah, no, you're right.
[01:17:49.740 --> 01:17:51.380]   You know, they're in the rear view mirror.
[01:17:51.380 --> 01:17:52.500]   Yeah.
[01:17:52.500 --> 01:17:55.540]   And the press release ends with--
[01:17:55.540 --> 01:17:58.180]   Apple is also spearheading the digital media
[01:17:58.180 --> 01:18:00.100]   revolution.
[01:18:00.100 --> 01:18:04.500]   OK, that's an important six words right there.
[01:18:04.500 --> 01:18:05.380]   That's new, actually.
[01:18:05.380 --> 01:18:06.340]   That's new boilerplate.
[01:18:06.340 --> 01:18:06.860]   Yeah.
[01:18:06.860 --> 01:18:07.360]   Yeah.
[01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:09.660]   It's to be that Apple has a good personal computer
[01:18:09.660 --> 01:18:10.100]   computer--
[01:18:10.100 --> 01:18:11.140]   They still say that.
[01:18:11.140 --> 01:18:12.660]   But at the end, this last sentence is
[01:18:12.660 --> 01:18:17.220]   Apple is spearheading the digital media revolution with its iPod,
[01:18:17.220 --> 01:18:19.340]   portable music and video players,
[01:18:19.340 --> 01:18:23.140]   and iTunes online store, and has entered the mobile phone
[01:18:23.140 --> 01:18:25.420]   market with its revolutionary iPhone.
[01:18:25.420 --> 01:18:28.140]   I would read a little into that too.
[01:18:28.140 --> 01:18:29.740]   They're pushing this digital media thing.
[01:18:29.740 --> 01:18:32.020]   I'm thinking we're really on track here with our--
[01:18:32.020 --> 01:18:32.980]   I think it's pretty big.
[01:18:32.980 --> 01:18:33.980]   Content.
[01:18:33.980 --> 01:18:38.820]   Focus for the I suck, whatever it's called.
[01:18:38.820 --> 01:18:41.420]   Oh, and then did you see that there's an I guide?
[01:18:41.420 --> 01:18:41.780]   What do you mean?
[01:18:41.780 --> 01:18:43.900]   Some people are thinking that, well, some people think
[01:18:43.900 --> 01:18:44.980]   that I guide is also on my account.
[01:18:44.980 --> 01:18:45.500]   Whoa!
[01:18:45.500 --> 01:18:48.780]   OK, let's put Google Goggle-like functionality into this.
[01:18:48.780 --> 01:18:52.900]   Well, but here's the thing is let's put--
[01:18:52.900 --> 01:18:53.860]   Howcast.
[01:18:53.860 --> 01:18:54.860]   Let's put--
[01:18:54.860 --> 01:18:55.780]   And what if you have--
[01:18:55.780 --> 01:18:58.740]   Not guide to like, touristic things, but guide to everything.
[01:18:58.740 --> 01:18:59.580]   Guide to life.
[01:18:59.580 --> 01:19:00.860]   What if you had-- what if you had--
[01:19:00.860 --> 01:19:01.700]   It's Ikea.
[01:19:01.700 --> 01:19:05.060]   What if you have an iTunes that basically says,
[01:19:05.060 --> 01:19:07.180]   I don't know how to cook this, or I don't know how to change
[01:19:07.180 --> 01:19:09.020]   the oil in my Audi, or I don't know how to do whatever it is.
[01:19:09.020 --> 01:19:11.060]   What if you buy a bookshelf and you get the little Ikea guys
[01:19:11.060 --> 01:19:11.620]   on that screen?
[01:19:11.620 --> 01:19:12.420]   It's just the right size.
[01:19:12.420 --> 01:19:13.260]   You put it in front of you?
[01:19:13.260 --> 01:19:13.860]   Oh, man.
[01:19:13.860 --> 01:19:14.340]   Maybe a little video.
[01:19:14.340 --> 01:19:15.820]   Maybe a little flash.
[01:19:15.820 --> 01:19:18.300]   It'd be good for people like me who do that kind of thing.
[01:19:18.300 --> 01:19:19.980]   I have people who do that.
[01:19:19.980 --> 01:19:21.460]   Same people who write my press releases.
[01:19:21.460 --> 01:19:24.100]   Exactly.
[01:19:24.100 --> 01:19:26.780]   Dane, put that book shelf together.
[01:19:26.780 --> 01:19:27.700]   That's interesting.
[01:19:27.700 --> 01:19:28.300]   A guide.
[01:19:28.300 --> 01:19:30.860]   OK, now I think we were inching into some interesting territory.
[01:19:30.860 --> 01:19:31.540]   There are--
[01:19:31.540 --> 01:19:33.500]   This is what they try to do with GarageBand
[01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:36.620]   with the music lessons, is try to take that and put it
[01:19:36.620 --> 01:19:37.180]   somewhere else.
[01:19:37.180 --> 01:19:38.580]   And by the way, $4.99 a pound.
[01:19:38.580 --> 01:19:40.060]   And I got to say, and I do have to say,
[01:19:40.060 --> 01:19:42.140]   it would be a lot easier to learn how to play the guitar
[01:19:42.140 --> 01:19:43.980]   from an isolate, or whatever they're going to call it
[01:19:43.980 --> 01:19:45.420]   than it would be from my computer.
[01:19:45.420 --> 01:19:46.820]   Because then I could be sitting anywhere.
[01:19:46.820 --> 01:19:48.460]   Anywhere I need to-- oh, I don't know how to do this.
[01:19:48.460 --> 01:19:49.660]   This gets into that whole matrix.
[01:19:49.660 --> 01:19:50.860]   Do you know how to fly that helicopter?
[01:19:50.860 --> 01:19:51.460]   Not yet.
[01:19:51.460 --> 01:19:53.580]   You know, and you're able to grab that.
[01:19:53.580 --> 01:19:55.700]   And as you look at that video content, going up,
[01:19:55.700 --> 01:19:58.180]   and again, a marketplace to do that.
[01:19:58.180 --> 01:20:00.700]   I know that when I told Leo that I was going to do a multi-cam
[01:20:00.700 --> 01:20:03.900]   edit for Twit, I mocked you.
[01:20:03.900 --> 01:20:05.820]   I didn't know how to do it when I said I was going to do it.
[01:20:05.820 --> 01:20:08.380]   Now you tell me.
[01:20:08.380 --> 01:20:10.020]   And it was possible.
[01:20:10.020 --> 01:20:11.380]   It was at one o'clock in the morning
[01:20:11.380 --> 01:20:12.940]   when I was banging my head on Final Cut,
[01:20:12.940 --> 01:20:14.580]   trying to figure out how to sync up these things.
[01:20:14.580 --> 01:20:18.820]   I would have paid $50 for a five-minute video on how to sync--
[01:20:18.820 --> 01:20:21.100]   how to sync three camera tracks.
[01:20:21.100 --> 01:20:24.060]   And so it's the ultimate health application just
[01:20:24.060 --> 01:20:24.900]   with you all the time.
[01:20:24.900 --> 01:20:25.940]   And that becomes--
[01:20:25.940 --> 01:20:28.300]   if Apple's taken 30% of all the--
[01:20:28.300 --> 01:20:30.940]   and that's a whole market to be--
[01:20:30.940 --> 01:20:33.100]   We've speculated-- and the New York Times
[01:20:33.100 --> 01:20:35.940]   gave rise to this speculation with a quote of a unnamed Apple
[01:20:35.940 --> 01:20:38.300]   employee who said this UI is not like anything you've ever
[01:20:38.300 --> 01:20:38.780]   seen before.
[01:20:38.780 --> 01:20:40.860]   We speculate a little bit about that.
[01:20:40.860 --> 01:20:41.540]   What do you think, John?
[01:20:41.540 --> 01:20:44.900]   Front-facing camera and minority report style waves?
[01:20:44.900 --> 01:20:46.540]   What are we going to be doing?
[01:20:46.540 --> 01:20:47.900]   I honestly don't know.
[01:20:47.900 --> 01:20:48.180]   I don't know.
[01:20:48.180 --> 01:20:49.580]   What can you do?
[01:20:49.580 --> 01:20:52.740]   I would guess a front-facing camera?
[01:20:52.740 --> 01:20:53.620]   I don't know.
[01:20:53.620 --> 01:20:57.340]   I don't do a lot of video chat.
[01:20:57.340 --> 01:20:58.540]   I mean--
[01:20:58.540 --> 01:21:00.260]   So I don't know how important is it?
[01:21:00.260 --> 01:21:02.700]   How important is the front-facing camera?
[01:21:02.700 --> 01:21:03.500]   I don't know about that.
[01:21:03.500 --> 01:21:04.580]   I would put it in.
[01:21:04.580 --> 01:21:06.180]   I would definitely put it as cheap.
[01:21:06.180 --> 01:21:07.020]   And I'd put it in.
[01:21:07.020 --> 01:21:08.580]   I don't know if you needed me to back-face the camera.
[01:21:08.580 --> 01:21:10.580]   I would think so because it's relatively cheap.
[01:21:10.580 --> 01:21:12.500]   I would think that--
[01:21:12.500 --> 01:21:14.780]   and that Apple has this sort of--
[01:21:14.780 --> 01:21:16.300]   and it's aesthetically pleasing the way
[01:21:16.300 --> 01:21:17.860]   that the whole surface is black,
[01:21:17.860 --> 01:21:19.420]   and you can put little things like the
[01:21:19.420 --> 01:21:22.660]   all the other iPhone sensors, the proximity sensor, et cetera,
[01:21:22.660 --> 01:21:25.140]   fit underneath this glossy black surface,
[01:21:25.140 --> 01:21:27.220]   and you don't even see it.
[01:21:27.220 --> 01:21:29.420]   So I would guess, I mean, why not?
[01:21:29.420 --> 01:21:30.220]   I don't know.
[01:21:30.220 --> 01:21:31.620]   But I don't know.
[01:21:31.620 --> 01:21:32.620]   I think it's going to be a good case.
[01:21:32.620 --> 01:21:32.620]   But I don't know.
[01:21:32.620 --> 01:21:33.940]   There's an awful lot of people who thought
[01:21:33.940 --> 01:21:36.100]   there was going to be a front-facing camera on the--
[01:21:36.100 --> 01:21:36.620]   Yeah.
[01:21:36.620 --> 01:21:37.180]   I think it's hard--
[01:21:37.180 --> 01:21:37.980]   I think it's hard--
[01:21:37.980 --> 01:21:40.900]   Real estate perspective to put it on the front of the iPhone.
[01:21:40.900 --> 01:21:43.020]   I think it's much easier to put it on the front of an isolate.
[01:21:43.020 --> 01:21:44.620]   I still think a very narrow bezel, though.
[01:21:44.620 --> 01:21:45.740]   I think you want to look-- this thing
[01:21:45.740 --> 01:21:47.140]   should look like it's a screen.
[01:21:47.140 --> 01:21:49.140]   Yeah, but then how do you hold it without your thumb?
[01:21:49.140 --> 01:21:50.500]   That's not about to say.
[01:21:50.500 --> 01:21:53.460]   You need to have like a paddle sections on the left
[01:21:53.460 --> 01:21:55.140]   and the right just to give you a place to hold up
[01:21:55.140 --> 01:21:57.140]   like your thumbs blocking something important.
[01:21:57.140 --> 01:21:59.300]   Shoot.
[01:21:59.300 --> 01:21:59.780]   That's the--
[01:21:59.780 --> 01:22:02.180]   Can I hold it like a waiter, like a tray?
[01:22:02.180 --> 01:22:03.940]   See, I was trying--
[01:22:03.940 --> 01:22:05.660]   I actually probably did the same thing
[01:22:05.660 --> 01:22:08.540]   that Alex was doing, where I actually say, well,
[01:22:08.540 --> 01:22:09.700]   here's a picture frame on my wall.
[01:22:09.700 --> 01:22:12.100]   I'm going to hold this in my hands for a little while
[01:22:12.100 --> 01:22:13.500]   and find out where things go.
[01:22:13.500 --> 01:22:15.580]   And I'm thinking, well, what if the user interface is just
[01:22:15.580 --> 01:22:19.580]   two arcs in the lower corners within the turning radius
[01:22:19.580 --> 01:22:20.260]   of my thumbs?
[01:22:20.260 --> 01:22:20.780]   We've seen that.
[01:22:20.780 --> 01:22:22.100]   So Microsoft did it.
[01:22:22.100 --> 01:22:24.060]   UMPC controls.
[01:22:24.060 --> 01:22:26.300]   There was two little arcs just as you described.
[01:22:26.300 --> 01:22:27.740]   Left and right where your thumbs would go.
[01:22:27.740 --> 01:22:29.140]   You'd hold the thing like this.
[01:22:29.140 --> 01:22:30.900]   Your thumbs would-- hold it on the sides.
[01:22:30.900 --> 01:22:31.740]   Your thumbs would go there.
[01:22:31.740 --> 01:22:34.900]   In fact, the whole keyboard would pop up left and right thumb.
[01:22:34.900 --> 01:22:36.460]   Or even if it was just smart enough
[01:22:36.460 --> 01:22:39.300]   to know figure out where you're resting your hand
[01:22:39.300 --> 01:22:40.500]   and decide that we know what.
[01:22:40.500 --> 01:22:42.180]   We're going to put a cluster of controls wherever
[01:22:42.180 --> 01:22:43.860]   your hand happens to be.
[01:22:43.860 --> 01:22:45.940]   And we're going to wait for--
[01:22:45.940 --> 01:22:49.220]   that's why I'm saying I think I could guess at half of it.
[01:22:49.220 --> 01:22:51.980]   I think the other half of it, nobody can guess that.
[01:22:51.980 --> 01:22:54.940]   At least that's what I'm hoping for.
[01:22:54.940 --> 01:22:56.260]   I think that there's an opportunity--
[01:22:56.260 --> 01:22:58.780]   and this is one of the things that I was sort of getting at
[01:22:58.780 --> 01:23:00.980]   is I think that in terms of redefining
[01:23:00.980 --> 01:23:04.180]   the personal computing interface for the future,
[01:23:04.180 --> 01:23:06.620]   that it's going to come out originally with these three,
[01:23:06.620 --> 01:23:08.260]   four main things that you're going to do.
[01:23:08.260 --> 01:23:09.540]   And they all ship with it.
[01:23:09.540 --> 01:23:10.940]   But the long term where you're going
[01:23:10.940 --> 01:23:12.700]   to be on this thing five years from now
[01:23:12.700 --> 01:23:15.900]   after developers, third party developers get a crack at it,
[01:23:15.900 --> 01:23:18.060]   is that who knows what type of apps
[01:23:18.060 --> 01:23:19.460]   they're going to come out with.
[01:23:19.460 --> 01:23:22.100]   But I think that the interface for it,
[01:23:22.100 --> 01:23:25.060]   there's the potential on a big touch screen
[01:23:25.060 --> 01:23:27.940]   with powerful--
[01:23:27.940 --> 01:23:29.460]   with the CPU, that's powerful enough
[01:23:29.460 --> 01:23:31.620]   to deal with a bunch of fingers at a time and stuff.
[01:23:31.620 --> 01:23:38.260]   To get this minority report style cool future user interface,
[01:23:38.260 --> 01:23:41.260]   not to overuse a terrible, terrible word, but paradigm.
[01:23:42.260 --> 01:23:44.700]   I think it could be something very, very new.
[01:23:44.700 --> 01:23:46.260]   I hope so. Absolutely.
[01:23:46.260 --> 01:23:47.260]   I hope so. I hope so.
[01:23:47.260 --> 01:23:48.860]   All right, enough of that.
[01:23:48.860 --> 01:23:51.860]   I was trying to find something besides the--
[01:23:51.860 --> 01:23:53.860]   I think--
[01:23:53.860 --> 01:23:55.860]   No, it is the sun.
[01:23:55.860 --> 01:23:59.660]   It has the gravitational pull in our attention system.
[01:23:59.660 --> 01:24:01.860]   And we are but MOS to its flame.
[01:24:01.860 --> 01:24:05.580]   Any other stories we want to cover
[01:24:05.580 --> 01:24:06.860]   before we get to our picks of the week?
[01:24:06.860 --> 01:24:10.780]   Anything else big in the Apple Mac universe?
[01:24:10.780 --> 01:24:11.780]   That's it.
[01:24:11.780 --> 01:24:13.780]   It's all we're going to be talking about, 3.26.
[01:24:13.780 --> 01:24:17.180]   Anything relevant to the Mac, John, you see at CES,
[01:24:17.180 --> 01:24:18.180]   will there be any announcements?
[01:24:18.180 --> 01:24:20.180]   Apple's not going to be there, obviously.
[01:24:20.180 --> 01:24:23.380]   I don't-- nothing that I'm aware of yet.
[01:24:23.380 --> 01:24:25.780]   I mean, I think it's more likely that there'd be
[01:24:25.780 --> 01:24:31.380]   maybe iPhone app announcements, but I don't know nothing yet.
[01:24:31.380 --> 01:24:34.180]   There is a CES iPhone app, which is--
[01:24:34.180 --> 01:24:37.580]   they have a goal to charge it by 1994.
[01:24:37.580 --> 01:24:40.580]   But it gives you maps, and you can put your schedule in there.
[01:24:40.580 --> 01:24:43.580]   And it's just-- I think follow me
[01:24:43.580 --> 01:24:45.580]   does this for other events as well.
[01:24:45.580 --> 01:24:46.580]   And that's who's doing it.
[01:24:46.580 --> 01:24:47.580]   It's odd that they're charging for it.
[01:24:47.580 --> 01:24:51.380]   I was at WWDC last year, and Apple had a custom app
[01:24:51.380 --> 01:24:52.780]   that they gave to developers.
[01:24:52.780 --> 01:24:53.780]   They did not charge.
[01:24:53.780 --> 01:24:56.580]   I guess they charge enough just for the regular tickets
[01:24:56.580 --> 01:24:57.580]   at WWDC.
[01:24:57.580 --> 01:24:59.580]   But it really is a great-- it was a fantastic way to do it.
[01:24:59.580 --> 01:25:00.580]   Oh, it's good to have.
[01:25:00.580 --> 01:25:01.580]   Yeah, Mac world had one too.
[01:25:01.580 --> 01:25:03.580]   Yeah, it's really helpful.
[01:25:03.580 --> 01:25:06.580]   I have to point out that this normally, January 26 event,
[01:25:06.580 --> 01:25:08.580]   would normally be where Apple would announce
[01:25:08.580 --> 01:25:10.580]   new iPhones for shipping in June.
[01:25:10.580 --> 01:25:13.580]   Do you think they will also announce new iPhones?
[01:25:13.580 --> 01:25:14.580]   I think they might know.
[01:25:14.580 --> 01:25:15.580]   No.
[01:25:15.580 --> 01:25:16.580]   I think new hardware.
[01:25:16.580 --> 01:25:17.580]   I think maybe a new OS.
[01:25:17.580 --> 01:25:18.580]   Yeah.
[01:25:18.580 --> 01:25:21.580]   No, since no Leopard Part II.
[01:25:21.580 --> 01:25:23.580]   No, no, no, no, iPhone iPhone iPhone iPhone.
[01:25:23.580 --> 01:25:24.580]   Oh, like 4.0.
[01:25:24.580 --> 01:25:25.580]   Yeah, 4.0.
[01:25:25.580 --> 01:25:28.580]   Like, it could be a combination announcement of the tablet
[01:25:28.580 --> 01:25:32.580]   and the-- what the last two years has taken place in March,
[01:25:32.580 --> 01:25:37.580]   the new SDK features for iPhone OS next,
[01:25:37.580 --> 01:25:39.580]   integer,
[01:25:39.580 --> 01:25:42.580]   >> We're definitely going to see a whole bunch of new keynote
[01:25:42.580 --> 01:25:43.580]   features.
[01:25:43.580 --> 01:25:48.580]   >> This is going to end with 10 minutes of chart gloating.
[01:25:48.580 --> 01:25:52.580]   In the past two years from a--
[01:25:52.580 --> 01:25:55.580]   a lot of racism that never existed before,
[01:25:55.580 --> 01:25:57.580]   we have created an ecology like this.
[01:25:57.580 --> 01:25:59.580]   This was the first month.
[01:25:59.580 --> 01:26:01.580]   This is the first six months.
[01:26:01.580 --> 01:26:03.580]   This is the first six months, six years.
[01:26:03.580 --> 01:26:09.580]   By 2030, we will own 40% of anything with the letter R in it.
[01:26:09.580 --> 01:26:11.580]   >> What about--
[01:26:11.580 --> 01:26:15.580]   >> All the new keynote features involve animations for graphs
[01:26:15.580 --> 01:26:16.580]   that go up.
[01:26:16.580 --> 01:26:21.580]   >> We're getting a new feature to make the uppy lines go even up here.
[01:26:21.580 --> 01:26:22.580]   >> We've got a great thing.
[01:26:22.580 --> 01:26:23.580]   It's a chart.
[01:26:23.580 --> 01:26:24.580]   We call it chart buster.
[01:26:24.580 --> 01:26:26.580]   It actually-- the line goes outside the screen.
[01:26:26.580 --> 01:26:27.580]   It's amazing.
[01:26:27.580 --> 01:26:29.580]   >> Fortunately, we cannot-- we cannot today play the chart
[01:26:29.580 --> 01:26:31.580]   that shows how much Microsoft and Google.
[01:26:31.580 --> 01:26:33.580]   >> We got so far out of the box.
[01:26:33.580 --> 01:26:34.580]   >> We cannot see it.
[01:26:34.580 --> 01:26:35.580]   >> We cannot see it on Google.
[01:26:35.580 --> 01:26:40.580]   >> So, Nokia is asking a US court to bar imports of Apple's
[01:26:40.580 --> 01:26:41.580]   Mac's iPhones and iPods.
[01:26:41.580 --> 01:26:42.580]   Yeah, it's just like that is.
[01:26:42.580 --> 01:26:43.580]   That's the Giggle Factor.
[01:26:43.580 --> 01:26:45.580]   >> You're all screwed.
[01:26:45.580 --> 01:26:49.580]   >> No, we'll never be able to get them anymore.
[01:26:49.580 --> 01:26:52.580]   >> Nokia's reaction to this thing really--
[01:26:52.580 --> 01:26:55.580]   I have my son turned six later this month.
[01:26:55.580 --> 01:26:56.580]   He's in kindergarten.
[01:26:56.580 --> 01:27:00.580]   And it really sort of seems like the way he argues with his friends.
[01:27:00.580 --> 01:27:01.580]   >> Yeah.
[01:27:01.580 --> 01:27:02.580]   >> Like, "Ah!"
[01:27:02.580 --> 01:27:03.580]   >> Screw you!
[01:27:03.580 --> 01:27:06.580]   >> I didn't want to go your stupid birthday party anyway.
[01:27:06.580 --> 01:27:07.580]   >> I can't see it.
[01:27:07.580 --> 01:27:09.580]   >> There's a lot of cool you that you've gotten invited and I
[01:27:09.580 --> 01:27:10.580]   didn't.
[01:27:10.580 --> 01:27:11.580]   >> Yeah!
[01:27:11.580 --> 01:27:14.580]   >> Besides, money's not going to be worth anything that the county
[01:27:14.580 --> 01:27:15.580]   collapsed the two years.
[01:27:15.580 --> 01:27:18.580]   We're smart by not getting lots of money.
[01:27:18.580 --> 01:27:19.580]   >> No.
[01:27:19.580 --> 01:27:20.580]   [laughter]
[01:27:20.580 --> 01:27:23.580]   >> We're lowering our stock price so we can become private again.
[01:27:23.580 --> 01:27:25.580]   That's always been our goal, idiots.
[01:27:25.580 --> 01:27:27.580]   >> They're not allowed on my spaceship.
[01:27:27.580 --> 01:27:28.580]   >> No.
[01:27:28.580 --> 01:27:29.580]   >> And--
[01:27:29.580 --> 01:27:31.580]   >> We'll be on "Friends" here.
[01:27:31.580 --> 01:27:36.580]   >> Ladies and gentlemen, get your picks ready because we're going to be doing those picks
[01:27:36.580 --> 01:27:37.580]   of the week in just a second.
[01:27:37.580 --> 01:27:41.780]   But first, my pick for a great place to go to get an audiobook audible--the only place
[01:27:41.780 --> 01:27:44.780]   as far as I'm concerned--audible.com/macbreako.
[01:27:44.780 --> 01:27:47.780]   They're right now signing up for the gold account and you'll get your first book free.
[01:27:47.780 --> 01:27:49.580]   Yours to keep you can cancel at any time.
[01:27:49.580 --> 01:27:55.080]   This is your way for free sampling what audiobooks can bring to your life.
[01:27:55.080 --> 01:27:57.080]   I listen to them all the time.
[01:27:57.080 --> 01:27:58.980]   I have it set so there's one I get in the car.
[01:27:58.980 --> 01:27:59.980]   It starts playing when I get out of the car.
[01:27:59.980 --> 01:28:00.980]   It stops.
[01:28:00.980 --> 01:28:02.480]   When I get to the gym, it starts playing.
[01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:04.380]   When I get off the treadmill, it stops.
[01:28:04.380 --> 01:28:06.780]   I mean, this is the soundtrack to my life now.
[01:28:06.780 --> 01:28:07.780]   Are these great books?
[01:28:07.780 --> 01:28:09.180]   >> I always look forward to it.
[01:28:09.180 --> 01:28:11.180]   Like, about the 15 minutes, 15, 20-minute walk.
[01:28:11.180 --> 01:28:12.180]   >> So I need--
[01:28:12.180 --> 01:28:14.580]   >> It's just I just get another little section of the book.
[01:28:14.580 --> 01:28:15.780]   >> And what great choices?
[01:28:15.780 --> 01:28:17.780]   I mean, 60,000 plus books now.
[01:28:17.780 --> 01:28:21.280]   Andy, do you want to do--you got something you want to talk about?
[01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:25.280]   >> I got something that I haven't started reading yet, but boy, is it on the on deck circle
[01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:26.580]   and just swinging three bats?
[01:28:26.580 --> 01:28:28.380]   Can't wait to read this.
[01:28:28.380 --> 01:28:34.080]   I start--I was on Netflix watching the entire season of that discovery show Everest Beyond
[01:28:34.080 --> 01:28:35.580]   the Limit the whole first season.
[01:28:35.580 --> 01:28:39.980]   It's a great show that covers the 2006 climbing season to summit Everest.
[01:28:39.980 --> 01:28:44.780]   And it's such a fascinating series because it wasn't a reality type show.
[01:28:44.780 --> 01:28:46.380]   It was more of a documentary show.
[01:28:46.380 --> 01:28:52.780]   And it just underscores how little you understand about the problems of scaling Mount Everest.
[01:28:52.780 --> 01:28:57.980]   That you--if you come up with ideas in your head, how you can die, well, it's really,
[01:28:57.980 --> 01:28:59.180]   cold to you might freeze a death.
[01:28:59.180 --> 01:29:01.180]   And boy, the oxygen is pretty thin up there.
[01:29:01.180 --> 01:29:03.380]   And I bet that you know, you have trouble breathing.
[01:29:03.380 --> 01:29:06.880]   But those are things that you can appreciate because those are things that can happen to
[01:29:06.880 --> 01:29:07.980]   you at sea level.
[01:29:07.980 --> 01:29:12.380]   Those aren't things that--there's an actual line on the side of the mountain that says,
[01:29:12.380 --> 01:29:16.780]   "When you are above this line in elevation, consider yourself on fire."
[01:29:16.780 --> 01:29:20.780]   That you are going to die--you are going to die in this state.
[01:29:20.780 --> 01:29:24.580]   The only--there isn't a--oh, well, I'll put on a--I'll take a special pill that let me
[01:29:24.580 --> 01:29:25.980]   survive being on fire.
[01:29:25.980 --> 01:29:30.780]   No, the only solution is to be below that line because your body starts to--it takes
[01:29:30.780 --> 01:29:31.780]   so much energy.
[01:29:31.780 --> 01:29:33.180]   Because you can tell I've been reading a lot about this.
[01:29:33.180 --> 01:29:36.580]   I've been so interested by this documentary, reading stuff on the side.
[01:29:36.580 --> 01:29:42.180]   That--it turns out that it takes so much energy to turn food into more energy that the
[01:29:42.180 --> 01:29:43.180]   body says, "You know what?
[01:29:43.180 --> 01:29:44.380]   I'm going to--I'm going to do something simpler.
[01:29:44.380 --> 01:29:48.580]   I'm going to start to destroy my own tissues for energy because that's actually more economical
[01:29:48.580 --> 01:29:49.580]   to do."
[01:29:49.580 --> 01:29:51.480]   So you will die above this elevation.
[01:29:51.480 --> 01:29:54.180]   So as you can imagine, a whole bunch of different rules apply.
[01:29:54.180 --> 01:30:00.100]   Now, the 2006 climbing season was very, very interesting because there were a couple of--there
[01:30:00.100 --> 01:30:01.660]   was one very significant death.
[01:30:01.660 --> 01:30:06.180]   There's always several, but this one was particularly significant because a climber was simply left
[01:30:06.180 --> 01:30:11.300]   at the side of one of the lines, passed by multiple climbers on the way up and the way
[01:30:11.300 --> 01:30:15.860]   down, which caused huge controversies in the climbing community and in the non-climbing
[01:30:15.860 --> 01:30:20.300]   community of how can you simply walk past this guy who's alive and just not help him,
[01:30:20.300 --> 01:30:22.060]   not help him get down the mountain.
[01:30:22.060 --> 01:30:25.900]   And so the interviews you read with people who are professional climbers and people who
[01:30:25.900 --> 01:30:31.100]   are there in the mountains, we're saying, "This is the correct analogy.
[01:30:31.100 --> 01:30:33.100]   It is like being inside a burning building.
[01:30:33.100 --> 01:30:36.300]   You know that there's someone alive in there, but you know that if you go up there to try
[01:30:36.300 --> 01:30:39.660]   to help them get them out, there'll be two bodies to deal with and not just one."
[01:30:39.660 --> 01:30:43.500]   That's not exactly--that's not necessarily the correct answer.
[01:30:43.500 --> 01:30:45.580]   It's, as I said, it's very, very controversial.
[01:30:45.580 --> 01:30:51.580]   This is why I've been very, very interested in--I've already purchased this book called
[01:30:51.580 --> 01:30:57.940]   "Dark Summit, the True Story of Everest's Most Controversial Season" by Nick Hale.
[01:30:57.940 --> 01:31:01.860]   It's a book all about this one climbing season that according to the reviews I've read and
[01:31:01.860 --> 01:31:06.260]   according to the sample chapters that I've read is a very, very good, very, very scholarly
[01:31:06.260 --> 01:31:11.940]   and very, very entertaining read about what that climbing season was like, what the experience
[01:31:11.940 --> 01:31:17.060]   of trying to summit Everest is like, and that it is a very, very complex issue.
[01:31:17.060 --> 01:31:22.980]   Among them is this climber who--the controversy of the idea of hiring guides that will help
[01:31:22.980 --> 01:31:24.540]   you get up the mountain.
[01:31:24.540 --> 01:31:26.180]   This is also very, very controversial.
[01:31:26.180 --> 01:31:32.180]   People saying that while you're turning Everest into sort of an adventure holiday, maybe encouraging
[01:31:32.180 --> 01:31:36.020]   people who aren't qualified to get up that mountain to try to do it anyway, then there's
[01:31:36.020 --> 01:31:40.860]   the other side that says, "No, the reason why you hired a guy like Russell Bryce is because
[01:31:40.860 --> 01:31:42.300]   he will stay at base camp.
[01:31:42.300 --> 01:31:43.300]   He has infrastructure.
[01:31:43.300 --> 01:31:44.300]   He has weather charts.
[01:31:44.300 --> 01:31:45.980]   He has 20 years of experience.
[01:31:45.980 --> 01:31:47.540]   He hires the best chirpas.
[01:31:47.540 --> 01:31:50.020]   He's not there to help you get up the mountain.
[01:31:50.020 --> 01:31:53.100]   He's there to help you get back to base camp alive."
[01:31:53.100 --> 01:31:56.740]   So it's exactly a sort of story that I like nonfiction.
[01:31:56.740 --> 01:31:58.100]   It's a very, very complex issue.
[01:31:58.100 --> 01:32:03.260]   It's a world that I know nothing about and just the first couple chapters left me thinking,
[01:32:03.260 --> 01:32:04.940]   "I don't know.
[01:32:04.940 --> 01:32:06.340]   Maybe it was right to leave him behind.
[01:32:06.340 --> 01:32:08.300]   Maybe I have no idea."
[01:32:08.300 --> 01:32:13.380]   People causes new synapses to fire very, very entertainingly throughout your brain, I think.
[01:32:13.380 --> 01:32:16.540]   If you're going to read that, and I'm going to put this on my list.
[01:32:16.540 --> 01:32:17.820]   It's freaking cold here.
[01:32:17.820 --> 01:32:19.540]   It's a very, very good time to read it.
[01:32:19.540 --> 01:32:20.540]   It's a pretty, pretty, pretty good time to read.
[01:32:20.540 --> 01:32:21.540]   Or in the summer.
[01:32:21.540 --> 01:32:26.260]   You got to read one of the, I think the best book ever written about summoning Everest,
[01:32:26.260 --> 01:32:31.260]   which is into thin air, John Crack-hours story of another deadly season.
[01:32:31.260 --> 01:32:35.020]   The deadliest season, I think, until 2006.
[01:32:35.020 --> 01:32:36.020]   That was in '96, I think.
[01:32:36.020 --> 01:32:37.020]   And you also have Into the Void.
[01:32:37.020 --> 01:32:38.020]   Into the Void.
[01:32:38.020 --> 01:32:39.020]   Yeah.
[01:32:39.020 --> 01:32:40.020]   Which was an insane movie.
[01:32:40.020 --> 01:32:41.020]   But in another--
[01:32:41.020 --> 01:32:45.620]   This book, if you read Into Thin Air, you will not-- don't start it until you have seven
[01:32:45.620 --> 01:32:50.020]   hours and 47 minutes to kill, because you will not stop.
[01:32:50.020 --> 01:32:51.660]   This is so dramatic.
[01:32:51.660 --> 01:32:54.620]   So I don't know if you've read that yet, Andy, but I would add that to the list too.
[01:32:54.620 --> 01:32:58.660]   I mean, once you start getting into Everest, this is another great one.
[01:32:58.660 --> 01:33:02.700]   So "Dark Summit," the true story of Everest most controversial season, into thin air,
[01:33:02.700 --> 01:33:06.180]   the true story also of Everest most deadly season.
[01:33:06.180 --> 01:33:07.180]   I was-- and--
[01:33:07.180 --> 01:33:08.180]   Go ahead, add one.
[01:33:08.180 --> 01:33:10.180]   No, into the void is another one.
[01:33:10.180 --> 01:33:11.180]   Into the void.
[01:33:11.180 --> 01:33:12.820]   It's not about Everest, but it's about a crazy climb.
[01:33:12.820 --> 01:33:20.460]   But I just want to say that I was 20 years ago, I was-- I got off a lift at the top of
[01:33:20.460 --> 01:33:26.100]   a Rapa Ho Basin in Colorado, and climbed to the top of that summit on with my skis, and
[01:33:26.100 --> 01:33:28.180]   decided I was never going to climb Everest ever.
[01:33:28.180 --> 01:33:29.180]   Oh.
[01:33:29.180 --> 01:33:32.540]   Well, that's-- you know, if that stopped you, then I think you're probably right.
[01:33:32.540 --> 01:33:33.540]   It's like, I got that.
[01:33:33.540 --> 01:33:35.180]   I think you made the right choice.
[01:33:35.180 --> 01:33:37.180]   Oh, boy, this mountain is high.
[01:33:37.180 --> 01:33:38.180]   Well, it's 14,000 feet.
[01:33:38.180 --> 01:33:39.180]   I mean, it's not--
[01:33:39.180 --> 01:33:40.180]   It's Everest.
[01:33:40.180 --> 01:33:43.180]   Oh, no, but I only had a climb, you know, 100 yards or 200 yards.
[01:33:43.180 --> 01:33:44.180]   And I was like, you know, this is--
[01:33:44.180 --> 01:33:45.180]   This is not for me.
[01:33:45.180 --> 01:33:47.180]   It was big in snowy, and I just like--
[01:33:47.180 --> 01:33:48.180]   It was big in snowy.
[01:33:48.180 --> 01:33:49.180]   Yes, it is.
[01:33:49.180 --> 01:33:51.180]   Actually, Everest is big in unsnoey.
[01:33:51.180 --> 01:33:53.180]   It's just stormy, and you need oxygen.
[01:33:53.180 --> 01:33:57.100]   "Dark Summit," the true story of Everest most controversial season by Nick Heil, narrated
[01:33:57.100 --> 01:33:58.660]   by David Drummond, our pick of the week.
[01:33:58.660 --> 01:34:00.900]   But, you know, Audible has 60,000 titles.
[01:34:00.900 --> 01:34:04.660]   So even if you'd like something a little more relaxing, like, oh, I don't know, left
[01:34:04.660 --> 01:34:10.700]   for dead, seaborn weather story, or high stories of survival from Everest and K-Tuba
[01:34:10.700 --> 01:34:14.380]   and Matt Dickinson, shattered air by Bob Magic.
[01:34:14.380 --> 01:34:18.220]   You could read these and more, go to audible.com/macbreak.
[01:34:18.220 --> 01:34:19.740]   One of those is free.
[01:34:19.740 --> 01:34:22.660]   And you wonder why I stay home and watch mountain climbing on television?
[01:34:22.660 --> 01:34:24.660]   Yeah, no, no, this is not a good--
[01:34:24.660 --> 01:34:29.300]   They've never written a book about the man who watched all season of the Discovery Channel
[01:34:29.300 --> 01:34:32.340]   and then was dead by the end of it.
[01:34:32.340 --> 01:34:33.660]   John, I know you probably--
[01:34:33.660 --> 01:34:35.500]   We didn't warn you, but we'd like to do a pick of the week.
[01:34:35.500 --> 01:34:37.460]   And I know you probably have many, many things you pick.
[01:34:37.460 --> 01:34:40.220]   I even see on the front page of daring fireball and excellent pick.
[01:34:40.220 --> 01:34:43.620]   But you want to pick something that you think is a great piece of hardware or software for
[01:34:43.620 --> 01:34:44.620]   Mac or iPhone owners?
[01:34:44.620 --> 01:34:46.900]   Yeah, you know what I'm going to say?
[01:34:46.900 --> 01:34:49.020]   It's not new, I don't think.
[01:34:49.020 --> 01:34:51.420]   But I'm going to pick Bento from File Make.
[01:34:51.420 --> 01:34:52.420]   It's funny.
[01:34:52.420 --> 01:34:53.980]   I just downloaded version three yesterday.
[01:34:53.980 --> 01:34:54.980]   Yeah.
[01:34:54.980 --> 01:34:57.060]   I've been-- I've had my eye on it since 1.0.
[01:34:57.060 --> 01:34:59.740]   It's up to 3.0 on the Mac.
[01:34:59.740 --> 01:35:03.060]   And I have an iPhone companion, which is really what got me to look at it again.
[01:35:03.060 --> 01:35:09.460]   When I first looked at it when it was 1.0, it struck me that it was like-- it just took
[01:35:09.460 --> 01:35:10.980]   me back to the old days.
[01:35:10.980 --> 01:35:16.980]   Like when File Maker 1.0 came back in the early mid-'90s, whenever that was, when it
[01:35:16.980 --> 01:35:17.980]   was Claris.
[01:35:17.980 --> 01:35:22.260]   And, hey, you know, you can make a database by just dragging fields out and--
[01:35:22.260 --> 01:35:24.220]   Really easy, yeah.
[01:35:24.220 --> 01:35:25.980]   Yeah, just easy.
[01:35:25.980 --> 01:35:27.420]   And it just makes sense.
[01:35:27.420 --> 01:35:30.900]   And it's a focus on a limited-- it's very apply.
[01:35:30.900 --> 01:35:34.420]   You know, File Maker is an Apple subsidiary.
[01:35:34.420 --> 01:35:36.300]   And I just look great, but I never used it.
[01:35:36.300 --> 01:35:39.100]   And it comes with a bunch of pre-made-- what do they call them?
[01:35:39.100 --> 01:35:40.100]   Templates.
[01:35:40.100 --> 01:35:41.100]   And they're neat.
[01:35:41.100 --> 01:35:44.580]   And they show you what you can do, but none of them really-- the templates sort of threw
[01:35:44.580 --> 01:35:48.500]   me off at first when Bento 1.0 came out, because I didn't really need to use any of
[01:35:48.500 --> 01:35:49.500]   them.
[01:35:49.500 --> 01:35:52.940]   But then when the iPhone app came out, I thought, you know what?
[01:35:52.940 --> 01:35:57.420]   There's a couple of things that I use that I keep on my iPhone in SimpleNote, or, you
[01:35:57.420 --> 01:35:59.660]   know, you could use any of the other little Notepad apps.
[01:35:59.660 --> 01:36:04.580]   But that are a little bit more structured than just a text note, you know?
[01:36:04.580 --> 01:36:07.340]   One thing I've been doing is writing down-- every time I go out to eat, write down what
[01:36:07.340 --> 01:36:09.140]   I got and whether I thought it was any good.
[01:36:09.140 --> 01:36:12.980]   So that the next time I go to the restaurant, I can remember-- because, you know, I'm just
[01:36:12.980 --> 01:36:17.100]   getting to the point where I don't really remember what I liked and what I didn't like.
[01:36:17.100 --> 01:36:21.420]   That happens sooner than it would like.
[01:36:21.420 --> 01:36:24.940]   And for little things like that, and, you know, keeping track of the movies I've watched
[01:36:24.940 --> 01:36:29.620]   and the books I've read, there's just a little bit more structure is useful.
[01:36:29.620 --> 01:36:32.020]   For that, then just a text note.
[01:36:32.020 --> 01:36:38.420]   And Bento, you know, it could not be simpler to set it up and make a little-- a simple
[01:36:38.420 --> 01:36:44.820]   little database with, you know, a couple of fields and sync it between your Mac and your
[01:36:44.820 --> 01:36:48.140]   iPhone or your iPod Touch in a great interface.
[01:36:48.140 --> 01:36:54.540]   It's almost like you-- it's a way on the iPhone to make your own little custom apps,
[01:36:54.540 --> 01:36:58.020]   you know, without any sort of, you know, programming whatsoever that you're not--
[01:36:58.020 --> 01:36:59.620]   How well does the iPhone app work?
[01:36:59.620 --> 01:37:02.300]   Because I was about to download it last night and I started reading reviews and it seemed
[01:37:02.300 --> 01:37:04.380]   like people were having all sorts of problems with it.
[01:37:04.380 --> 01:37:05.380]   It works great for me.
[01:37:05.380 --> 01:37:06.940]   I mean, I haven't run into a single problem.
[01:37:06.940 --> 01:37:07.940]   I'm not designing.
[01:37:07.940 --> 01:37:09.300]   I will say that I don't know.
[01:37:09.300 --> 01:37:14.780]   I mean, I made my little movies I've watched, uh, database and restaurants.
[01:37:14.780 --> 01:37:15.780]   I've been to database.
[01:37:15.780 --> 01:37:19.260]   I made them on the Mac and then sync them to the iPhone.
[01:37:19.260 --> 01:37:24.700]   I don't know if, you know, how easy it is to actually, you know, specify the fields
[01:37:24.700 --> 01:37:25.700]   in the iPhone version.
[01:37:25.700 --> 01:37:26.860]   Although you can do it.
[01:37:26.860 --> 01:37:28.860]   I did tinker around with the little one.
[01:37:28.860 --> 01:37:30.660]   It's pretty cool.
[01:37:30.660 --> 01:37:32.140]   But it just works and it's great.
[01:37:32.140 --> 01:37:39.100]   And you know, it's really almost like, you know, like the equivalent of like a visual
[01:37:39.100 --> 01:37:42.660]   basic or something like that, you know, like a way to make little GUI apps, simple little
[01:37:42.660 --> 01:37:46.140]   GUI apps for yourself, just to scratch your own itch.
[01:37:46.140 --> 01:37:49.020]   And I just sort of blew me away at how simple it was.
[01:37:49.020 --> 01:37:52.860]   I mean, compared to what the real file maker has grown to over the years, which is great
[01:37:52.860 --> 01:37:55.980]   and there's, you know, conferences and it's a developer tool.
[01:37:55.980 --> 01:38:00.380]   You know, Bento really kicks back to the origins of the personal database.
[01:38:00.380 --> 01:38:04.780]   I did a lot of file maker in those days and I've done tons and tons of file maker.
[01:38:04.780 --> 01:38:09.020]   And I realized when I looked at the last, the newest version of Bento was that most like
[01:38:09.020 --> 01:38:13.580]   90% of what I do when I make a database and file maker, I can do in Bento.
[01:38:13.580 --> 01:38:17.180]   I don't need to do, I don't need the full file maker for probably 99%.
[01:38:17.180 --> 01:38:21.220]   It's really, I just can't emphasize how, you know, if you're familiar with the modern
[01:38:21.220 --> 01:38:26.020]   conventions of an Apple app of especially, it's very, it really does feel like it's
[01:38:26.020 --> 01:38:27.500]   part of the iWork suite.
[01:38:27.500 --> 01:38:30.020]   I mean, it just visually fits right alongside it.
[01:38:30.020 --> 01:38:31.220]   And is it Apple Scriptable?
[01:38:31.220 --> 01:38:33.380]   Does it have its own scripting like file maker?
[01:38:33.380 --> 01:38:34.380]   You know, I don't know.
[01:38:34.380 --> 01:38:35.380]   I didn't.
[01:38:35.380 --> 01:38:36.380]   You don't even need the script really.
[01:38:36.380 --> 01:38:39.140]   Yeah, even though, I mean, I love Apple Script and use it, but I, you know, for the
[01:38:39.140 --> 01:38:43.260]   little, little list of things, little structured list of things that I've been making with
[01:38:43.260 --> 01:38:45.180]   it, there was no need for scripting at all.
[01:38:45.180 --> 01:38:49.180]   You just drag out, you know, text field here, date field here.
[01:38:49.180 --> 01:38:52.220]   I didn't realize how many third party templates they've got online now.
[01:38:52.220 --> 01:38:53.220]   This is really remarkable.
[01:38:53.220 --> 01:38:56.700]   Yeah, it's, it's, it's like, it's like a wish that lets you ask for more wishes in terms
[01:38:56.700 --> 01:38:58.140]   of buying a single application.
[01:38:58.140 --> 01:39:02.460]   A friend of mine, just the other day, just two days ago asked me was looking for suggestions
[01:39:02.460 --> 01:39:06.940]   on I want to, for my New Year's resolution, I want to do a daily journal, not a blog there.
[01:39:06.940 --> 01:39:10.740]   I just want like a daily diary was asking for recommendations for Mac apps.
[01:39:10.740 --> 01:39:12.580]   And I said, no, get, get Bento.
[01:39:12.580 --> 01:39:16.340]   Not only, not only because there's probably, there's multiple templates for a daily journal
[01:39:16.340 --> 01:39:19.860]   out there, but also because it allows you to put your own spin on it.
[01:39:19.860 --> 01:39:24.100]   If a month later you just realized, yeah, I, I drink a lot of coffee during the course
[01:39:24.100 --> 01:39:25.100]   of the day.
[01:39:25.100 --> 01:39:26.100]   I want to start keeping track.
[01:39:26.100 --> 01:39:27.100]   Right.
[01:39:27.100 --> 01:39:28.100]   Exactly.
[01:39:28.100 --> 01:39:31.100]   It'll take you about 10 seconds to add a field saying here's how many cups of coffee I drank
[01:39:31.100 --> 01:39:32.100]   today.
[01:39:32.100 --> 01:39:34.940]   And then you can get the charts and you can get the graphs and then you can have data saying,
[01:39:34.940 --> 01:39:38.180]   yes, I am slowly killing myself with overcome assumptions.
[01:39:38.180 --> 01:39:39.180]   Good.
[01:39:39.180 --> 01:39:43.820]   And I just can't emphasize that that's really the angle that got me to switch from being,
[01:39:43.820 --> 01:39:47.540]   hey, that looks neat to actually using it was the difference.
[01:39:47.540 --> 01:39:50.640]   My, like when I first looked at Bento a couple of years ago, it was just looking at the
[01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:56.420]   pre-made templates and hey, they look neat, but it's the absolute brain dead simple ease
[01:39:56.420 --> 01:40:00.740]   of either customizing one of those, if it's almost what you want, or just starting from
[01:40:00.740 --> 01:40:05.580]   scratch with a blank one and just throwing a couple of fields there and having a new,
[01:40:05.580 --> 01:40:11.300]   what do they call them libraries, but it's, it's really, really amazing product.
[01:40:11.300 --> 01:40:14.620]   So that's my $49, $50 for a new version.
[01:40:14.620 --> 01:40:18.580]   If you've got one or two, you can upgrade for $20 less than I think it's $4.99 for the
[01:40:18.580 --> 01:40:19.580]   iPhone app.
[01:40:19.580 --> 01:40:20.580]   It's great.
[01:40:20.580 --> 01:40:21.580]   Yeah.
[01:40:21.580 --> 01:40:22.900]   And the iPhone version is five bucks.
[01:40:22.900 --> 01:40:23.900]   Five bucks.
[01:40:23.900 --> 01:40:25.620]   And definitely, in my opinion, definitely worth it.
[01:40:25.620 --> 01:40:26.620]   And it's a big part of the video.
[01:40:26.620 --> 01:40:27.620]   I'm going to buy it now.
[01:40:27.620 --> 01:40:31.340]   I was holding off because I just saw those reviews, but that's great.
[01:40:31.340 --> 01:40:32.340]   That's good news.
[01:40:32.340 --> 01:40:36.620]   Bento, it's from filemaker.com/bento.
[01:40:36.620 --> 01:40:39.140]   Mr. Alex Lizzie, a recommendation for you by Fred.
[01:40:39.140 --> 01:40:40.660]   I got another iPhone recommendation.
[01:40:40.660 --> 01:40:41.660]   Of course you do.
[01:40:41.660 --> 01:40:42.660]   Yeah, you know.
[01:40:42.660 --> 01:40:43.660]   I'm an iPhone guy.
[01:40:43.660 --> 01:40:44.660]   I like iPhones.
[01:40:44.660 --> 01:40:46.460]   So I like wine.
[01:40:46.460 --> 01:40:47.460]   Okay.
[01:40:47.460 --> 01:40:48.460]   Don't we all?
[01:40:48.460 --> 01:40:49.460]   We all like Sonoma County.
[01:40:49.460 --> 01:40:50.460]   I mean, how can you not?
[01:40:50.460 --> 01:40:51.460]   I feel like why.
[01:40:51.460 --> 01:40:52.460]   It's like a requirement.
[01:40:52.460 --> 01:40:55.380]   Like when we went to rent our house, they said we're going to rent your house, but do
[01:40:55.380 --> 01:40:56.380]   you like wine?
[01:40:56.380 --> 01:41:01.100]   Because you know, we can't let you actually move to Petaluma if you don't like wine.
[01:41:01.100 --> 01:41:03.300]   So I like wine, but I don't know very much about it.
[01:41:03.300 --> 01:41:07.100]   You know, I like wine and I kind of know how to swirl my little glass and stuff like
[01:41:07.100 --> 01:41:09.300]   that and look useful, but I don't know what I'm doing.
[01:41:09.300 --> 01:41:10.300]   And so I go into these.
[01:41:10.300 --> 01:41:14.700]   The only place I usually shop for wine is in Bevmo.
[01:41:14.700 --> 01:41:18.260]   And for those of you who don't have Bevmo, I'm sorry, at first, Bevmo is kind of like
[01:41:18.260 --> 01:41:23.260]   the Walmart of alcohol, you know, which is why I go there often because, you know, that's
[01:41:23.260 --> 01:41:24.260]   what I like.
[01:41:24.260 --> 01:41:25.260]   It's just for your do.
[01:41:25.260 --> 01:41:28.460]   So anyway, the, but you can get, you can get anything and you can get it cheap, you
[01:41:28.460 --> 01:41:34.300]   know, and so, and so you walk into the wine, the great thing about, about Bevmo is that
[01:41:34.300 --> 01:41:39.860]   it has all the wine enthusiast ratings, you know, on it.
[01:41:39.860 --> 01:41:42.140]   And so I tend to go there, but it's a little far away.
[01:41:42.140 --> 01:41:46.300]   There's places that are closer to where I live that I could get wine, but I just don't
[01:41:46.300 --> 01:41:47.300]   know.
[01:41:47.300 --> 01:41:48.300]   I want to experiment.
[01:41:48.300 --> 01:41:51.660]   I want to play with wine, but I find that if it doesn't have at least a 90 in wine
[01:41:51.660 --> 01:41:54.220]   enthusiast, the chances of me liking it are much lower.
[01:41:54.220 --> 01:41:57.180]   It's much higher with 90, a 90 points are above.
[01:41:57.180 --> 01:42:01.500]   I just know that I can just play with that wine, you know, and so wine enthusiast has
[01:42:01.500 --> 01:42:03.540]   an app called WineGod.
[01:42:03.540 --> 01:42:04.540]   There's an app for that.
[01:42:04.540 --> 01:42:05.700]   There is an app for that.
[01:42:05.700 --> 01:42:11.020]   So now I can be in any, I can go to Rayleys, I can go to the Petaluma market, I can go
[01:42:11.020 --> 01:42:12.020]   to whatever.
[01:42:12.020 --> 01:42:13.020]   And look.
[01:42:13.020 --> 01:42:18.500]   And I can search by wine brand or producer and it gives me what the, what their rating
[01:42:18.500 --> 01:42:19.500]   is.
[01:42:19.500 --> 01:42:22.460]   Now I know that I shouldn't be just going by rating, but how else do you pick out a bunch
[01:42:22.460 --> 01:42:25.260]   of wines when you're walking into a random wine store and you want to try something new?
[01:42:25.260 --> 01:42:27.140]   I don't want to just open them up and sample them.
[01:42:27.140 --> 01:42:29.940]   Well, I thought of that and then they kicked me out of the Petaluma market and I couldn't
[01:42:29.940 --> 01:42:30.940]   come back and have a salad.
[01:42:30.940 --> 01:42:31.940]   I have to try before I buy it.
[01:42:31.940 --> 01:42:32.940]   Don't you have a tester?
[01:42:32.940 --> 01:42:33.940]   Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[01:42:33.940 --> 01:42:37.660]   So, and you know, I should go to places and check it out, but I just, when I'm one, a
[01:42:37.660 --> 01:42:40.660]   new, a new bottle of wine, I want to be able to know what the rating is.
[01:42:40.660 --> 01:42:42.100]   I don't want to buy vinegar.
[01:42:42.100 --> 01:42:44.860]   So anyway, it's $4.99.
[01:42:44.860 --> 01:42:49.500]   It's not super cheap, but if you buy wine, it's, you know, buying a bad bottle of wine
[01:42:49.500 --> 01:42:50.780]   is expensive.
[01:42:50.780 --> 01:42:54.380]   So anyway, so that's my, that's my pick of the week.
[01:42:54.380 --> 01:42:56.420]   It's the Wine Buying Guide.
[01:42:56.420 --> 01:42:57.580]   I think it's what they call it.
[01:42:57.580 --> 01:43:01.980]   It's Wine Guide and it's the Wine Enthusiast Wine Guide.
[01:43:01.980 --> 01:43:05.700]   There's another one that is actually pretty good wine ratings, but the problem with it
[01:43:05.700 --> 01:43:10.180]   is that it doesn't, you know, you can see what other people have rated it, but you don't
[01:43:10.180 --> 01:43:12.980]   really see what, you know, Wine Enthusiast, I mean, these guys get paid to do that.
[01:43:12.980 --> 01:43:14.660]   No, that's a good, I trust Wine Enthusiast.
[01:43:14.660 --> 01:43:15.660]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:43:15.660 --> 01:43:16.980]   They're going to, that's my thing.
[01:43:16.980 --> 01:43:17.980]   Wine Guide, how much?
[01:43:17.980 --> 01:43:18.980]   One nine, four nine nine.
[01:43:18.980 --> 01:43:21.340]   Seems to be two balls of a trade.
[01:43:21.340 --> 01:43:27.860]   And he does in fact know the price of night train, which is kind of impressive.
[01:43:27.860 --> 01:43:31.420]   I'm going to do a quick pick, which is something that I've resisted.
[01:43:31.420 --> 01:43:32.740]   You know, I have an IFI.
[01:43:32.740 --> 01:43:36.060]   These are the little SD cards that have built in WiFi and they're very cool.
[01:43:36.060 --> 01:43:43.660]   It's a really great idea, but it's been slow and low, two gigabytes and it takes forever
[01:43:43.660 --> 01:43:46.220]   to get a, it's just not good SD.
[01:43:46.220 --> 01:43:51.260]   Well today they've announced and I'm going to order it right away, IFI Pro, which is
[01:43:51.260 --> 01:43:52.620]   X2 SD.
[01:43:52.620 --> 01:43:54.940]   Finally, they've got high speed SD available.
[01:43:54.940 --> 01:43:56.300]   I have an IFI Pro.
[01:43:56.300 --> 01:43:58.060]   Is that eight gigabytes?
[01:43:58.060 --> 01:43:59.060]   This is new.
[01:43:59.060 --> 01:44:00.780]   Brand new just came out today.
[01:44:00.780 --> 01:44:04.700]   So, and eight gigabytes, which is another big thing for me is just never had enough memory
[01:44:04.700 --> 01:44:05.700]   on it.
[01:44:05.700 --> 01:44:07.180]   And it's class six read and write.
[01:44:07.180 --> 01:44:13.460]   So that is fast enough to keep up with something like the EP1 or the Lumix LX3.
[01:44:13.460 --> 01:44:17.620]   Unfortunately, you know, I still like to shoot with a 5D and that's compact flash.
[01:44:17.620 --> 01:44:22.820]   But if you have a card, a camera that uses SD cards, if you haven't played with the IFI
[01:44:22.820 --> 01:44:27.300]   and I have to say I was loath to recommend it as cool as the technology was just because
[01:44:27.300 --> 01:44:29.220]   it was so darn slow.
[01:44:29.220 --> 01:44:32.620]   And so darn small, this is now what you need.
[01:44:32.620 --> 01:44:33.620]   You've inspired me.
[01:44:33.620 --> 01:44:34.620]   Yeah.
[01:44:34.620 --> 01:44:35.620]   These are, this is great.
[01:44:35.620 --> 01:44:37.620]   I'm going to have to, what I like to do is I'm going to hook it up to my, I didn't think
[01:44:37.620 --> 01:44:40.820]   of taking this to CES, but I think what I'll do is I'll take it because you have Wi-Fi
[01:44:40.820 --> 01:44:42.980]   there and I have, well Wi-Fi or I'll use my Wi-Fi.
[01:44:42.980 --> 01:44:48.220]   So I have my IFI connected to my my, my Fi as a Wi-Fi and then it'll.
[01:44:48.220 --> 01:44:49.220]   Oh.
[01:44:49.220 --> 01:44:50.220]   Third base.
[01:44:50.220 --> 01:44:51.220]   Oh.
[01:44:51.220 --> 01:44:57.660]   I was doing that with my Wi-Fi too.
[01:44:57.660 --> 01:45:03.900]   I was doing a generation two card and the first time I was sort of, you don't appreciate
[01:45:03.900 --> 01:45:12.100]   how bad even like a two megapixel camera phone is until the first time you pop an IFI card
[01:45:12.100 --> 01:45:15.180]   into like an any sort of a pocket digital camera.
[01:45:15.180 --> 01:45:21.060]   I have the My Find My Pocket and I was taking pictures of my dinner at Zoftigs and the results
[01:45:21.060 --> 01:45:26.860]   I was getting in terms of reactions to the food online were quite a bit more genetic
[01:45:26.860 --> 01:45:31.340]   in nature than they would have been if it was just simply my camera phone picture.
[01:45:31.340 --> 01:45:34.220]   It is incredible technology as a journalist.
[01:45:34.220 --> 01:45:38.660]   I really feel like Edison Carter that I take a picture, it gets published.
[01:45:38.660 --> 01:45:39.660]   I take another picture.
[01:45:39.660 --> 01:45:40.660]   It gets published.
[01:45:40.660 --> 01:45:41.660]   Wow.
[01:45:41.660 --> 01:45:42.660]   It's so cool.
[01:45:42.660 --> 01:45:45.700]   We have the old IFI here and we use it for our house camera because it goes right on
[01:45:45.700 --> 01:45:48.420]   the flicker as it take pictures and that really is fun.
[01:45:48.420 --> 01:45:51.220]   But the, it's, don't call it the pro call it the X2.
[01:45:51.220 --> 01:45:52.220]   The pro has been out for a while.
[01:45:52.220 --> 01:45:53.220]   It's the X2.
[01:45:53.220 --> 01:45:56.740]   8 gigabytes, 6X read write speed.
[01:45:56.740 --> 01:45:59.900]   That is, that is what they finally needed and I look forward to getting one.
[01:45:59.900 --> 01:46:04.220]   I mean, this is weird, but it's an SD card with a Wi-Fi chip on it that you don't need
[01:46:04.220 --> 01:46:06.620]   any special extra anything.
[01:46:06.620 --> 01:46:07.860]   They say about 150 bucks.
[01:46:07.860 --> 01:46:12.980]   So it's pricey for 8 gigs, but I think that's finally something that I would recommend.
[01:46:12.980 --> 01:46:17.660]   Finally ladies and gentlemen, add the adotko as his pick of the week.
[01:46:17.660 --> 01:46:18.660]   He did.
[01:46:18.660 --> 01:46:20.740]   He did book, he did a book pick.
[01:46:20.740 --> 01:46:23.060]   That's why he gets a double pick.
[01:46:23.060 --> 01:46:25.660]   He's, yeah, he gets two because he's.
[01:46:25.660 --> 01:46:26.660]   Okay.
[01:46:26.660 --> 01:46:31.500]   Um, actually this is, this is one of those quick and simple little utilities.
[01:46:31.500 --> 01:46:35.580]   One of the features that I really liked out of Windows 7 was their snap feature for managing
[01:46:35.580 --> 01:46:39.340]   Windows where if you, if there are times when you want to have two windows side by side,
[01:46:39.340 --> 01:46:44.500]   so you can do a side by side comparison in Windows 7, you just drag a window to the left
[01:46:44.500 --> 01:46:47.060]   or the right edge of the window of the screen.
[01:46:47.060 --> 01:46:50.700]   It will not only resize to half the size of the screen, but will also sort of lock to
[01:46:50.700 --> 01:46:52.020]   that side of the window.
[01:46:52.020 --> 01:46:54.220]   So it's very, very easy to set up that sort of thing.
[01:46:54.220 --> 01:46:57.860]   They also have a feature where if you drag the title bar of window to the top edge, it
[01:46:57.860 --> 01:47:02.300]   immediately fills the entire parameters of the screen, not by some sort of weird resize
[01:47:02.300 --> 01:47:03.300]   algorithm.
[01:47:03.300 --> 01:47:07.140]   It will simply grow to expand the, to fit all dimensions of the screen.
[01:47:07.140 --> 01:47:13.420]   Sinch is a $7 utility from irradiated software that just adds that feature to Mac OS 10.
[01:47:13.420 --> 01:47:18.540]   So it's very, it's a very, very handy way to manage lots and lots of windows to manage
[01:47:18.540 --> 01:47:24.460]   automatically stack tile and grow and shrink windows.
[01:47:24.460 --> 01:47:25.460]   It's kind of in that category.
[01:47:25.460 --> 01:47:27.580]   It's arrow snap.
[01:47:27.580 --> 01:47:30.020]   It's arrow snap for Mac.
[01:47:30.020 --> 01:47:33.100]   And it's really, I don't need to make it any more complicated than that.
[01:47:33.100 --> 01:47:37.860]   It's a lot handier than you might even think it is because once you sort of integrate that
[01:47:37.860 --> 01:47:44.100]   into your workflow, I don't like the behavior of the maximize button in Mac OS because
[01:47:44.100 --> 01:47:45.100]   I don't either.
[01:47:45.100 --> 01:47:46.100]   It doesn't maximize.
[01:47:46.100 --> 01:47:47.100]   Exactly.
[01:47:47.100 --> 01:47:49.380]   It'll fill the screen, but it will not fill all dimensions.
[01:47:49.380 --> 01:47:51.260]   And that's really what I wanted to do.
[01:47:51.260 --> 01:47:54.140]   So this is what irradiated software, Sinch will do.
[01:47:54.140 --> 01:47:56.820]   They have a couple of freebies.
[01:47:56.820 --> 01:48:00.260]   It's a, it's a, it's a typical demo until you pay for it.
[01:48:00.260 --> 01:48:06.140]   They also create, they also have an app called a two up, which is a free app that will,
[01:48:06.140 --> 01:48:11.420]   is good for automatically doing side by side window of bills, but that removes the snap,
[01:48:11.420 --> 01:48:12.540]   the arrow snap feature.
[01:48:12.540 --> 01:48:17.940]   It's something that operates via a, a, a manual it as opposed to just drag it someplace and
[01:48:17.940 --> 01:48:19.340]   this is what happens.
[01:48:19.340 --> 01:48:23.620]   But it's, it'll give you an idea of the functionality of the app and it's free, free, free forever.
[01:48:23.620 --> 01:48:25.900]   But it's this, but Sinch is definitely worth seven bucks.
[01:48:25.900 --> 01:48:27.300]   It was a very, very quick seven bucks.
[01:48:27.300 --> 01:48:28.300]   Yeah.
[01:48:28.300 --> 01:48:29.780]   This just solves my whole life problem.
[01:48:29.780 --> 01:48:32.540]   Cause it's mostly Safari that just bugs the heck out of me.
[01:48:32.540 --> 01:48:36.340]   Somebody actually saw me doing it on live all the time.
[01:48:36.340 --> 01:48:40.620]   You know, I maximize Safari than drag and drag and drag.
[01:48:40.620 --> 01:48:44.300]   Somebody sent me a JavaScript that does it, but it only does it for Safari.
[01:48:44.300 --> 01:48:45.300]   This is great.
[01:48:45.300 --> 01:48:47.180]   I need this for a, this should work with just about everything.
[01:48:47.180 --> 01:48:49.020]   It works via GUI scripting.
[01:48:49.020 --> 01:48:53.820]   Uh, so the only limitations are that if you have an application that does not use standard
[01:48:53.820 --> 01:48:56.220]   guidelines, uh, then it won't work.
[01:48:56.220 --> 01:48:59.420]   So for instance, uh, Adobe, uh, Lightroom probably won't work.
[01:48:59.420 --> 01:49:00.420]   Of course not.
[01:49:00.420 --> 01:49:02.740]   But work, you know, all these other, all the other products work work.
[01:49:02.740 --> 01:49:03.740]   Yeah.
[01:49:03.740 --> 01:49:04.740]   Right.
[01:49:04.740 --> 01:49:05.740]   But it's just right.
[01:49:05.740 --> 01:49:06.740]   Yeah.
[01:49:06.740 --> 01:49:07.740]   It's, it's, it's a nice app.
[01:49:07.740 --> 01:49:08.740]   Just, just what I need in seven bucks.
[01:49:08.740 --> 01:49:09.740]   Seven bucks.
[01:49:09.740 --> 01:49:10.740]   Annie and not go.
[01:49:10.740 --> 01:49:11.740]   Thank you for your pick.
[01:49:11.740 --> 01:49:13.100]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:49:13.100 --> 01:49:14.100]   What fun.
[01:49:14.100 --> 01:49:15.100]   We're going to take off for Vegas tomorrow.
[01:49:15.100 --> 01:49:19.940]   I hope you'll watch our live coverage, even though there won't be much Mac stuff at live.twit.tv.
[01:49:19.940 --> 01:49:22.900]   You can also go to TWIT.tv/CES.
[01:49:22.900 --> 01:49:23.900]   There's a podcast.
[01:49:23.900 --> 01:49:24.900]   We'll be putting out content.
[01:49:24.900 --> 01:49:27.940]   We've already put out three shows or four shows, more content all the time.
[01:49:27.940 --> 01:49:30.700]   Uh, so you can download the content if you can't watch it live.
[01:49:30.700 --> 01:49:33.420]   Um, and you're going to be doing some stuff too right now.
[01:49:33.420 --> 01:49:38.180]   We're going to be doing a bunch of shows for Mac break and, and for this week of photography.
[01:49:38.180 --> 01:49:39.180]   So we're going to be doing it.
[01:49:39.180 --> 01:49:40.540]   They'll be coming out over the next couple weeks.
[01:49:40.540 --> 01:49:41.860]   Six of four.tv for that.
[01:49:41.860 --> 01:49:43.220]   Uh, it'll be on pixcourt.tv.
[01:49:43.220 --> 01:49:47.580]   Yeah, we're, I don't know what, it's crazy for us to do live and then almost instant downloads
[01:49:47.580 --> 01:49:48.580]   too.
[01:49:48.580 --> 01:49:50.740]   Yeah, we have to bring, we're bringing like three Mac pros down.
[01:49:50.740 --> 01:49:51.740]   We're bringing editors.
[01:49:51.740 --> 01:49:52.740]   I mean, it's crazy.
[01:49:52.740 --> 01:49:53.740]   There's like two of us going.
[01:49:53.740 --> 01:49:55.380]   Yeah, this is nuts.
[01:49:55.380 --> 01:49:56.380]   This is nuts.
[01:49:56.380 --> 01:50:00.340]   You know, if I told you how much this was costing, you would gasp in pain and disbelief.
[01:50:00.340 --> 01:50:01.540]   Yeah, we're taking two people.
[01:50:01.540 --> 01:50:02.540]   Yeah.
[01:50:02.540 --> 01:50:04.300]   Well, that's why you're bringing freezer bags for all that shrimp.
[01:50:04.300 --> 01:50:05.580]   Well, you'll be eating for three weeks.
[01:50:05.580 --> 01:50:06.580]   Yeah.
[01:50:06.580 --> 01:50:07.580]   You better believe it.
[01:50:07.580 --> 01:50:08.580]   Chocolate fountain are us.
[01:50:08.580 --> 01:50:11.780]   I told the staff, if you don't eat there, you're not eating.
[01:50:11.780 --> 01:50:13.780]   So please stock up.
[01:50:13.780 --> 01:50:17.180]   Not only that, if you don't come in with what, if you can, with fewer than eight pounds,
[01:50:17.180 --> 01:50:19.820]   we're the, we're the recyclable food.
[01:50:19.820 --> 01:50:22.540]   I think $12 per DM is not unreasonable.
[01:50:22.540 --> 01:50:23.540]   I'm sorry.
[01:50:23.540 --> 01:50:25.540]   Free water at the Bellagio fountain.
[01:50:25.540 --> 01:50:27.060]   Free water at the fountains.
[01:50:27.060 --> 01:50:32.620]   John Gruber is the man who writes the incredible daring fireball blog at daring fireball.net.
[01:50:32.620 --> 01:50:35.180]   Although I had just learned that.com works too.
[01:50:35.180 --> 01:50:36.180]   Wow.
[01:50:36.180 --> 01:50:37.180]   Your choice.
[01:50:37.180 --> 01:50:38.180]   Your choice.
[01:50:38.180 --> 01:50:40.260]   Isn't that nice of you?
[01:50:40.260 --> 01:50:45.060]   John have a great time staying warm and dry and Philly.
[01:50:45.060 --> 01:50:46.060]   Please come back.
[01:50:46.060 --> 01:50:47.420]   Yeah, it'll be fun.
[01:50:47.420 --> 01:50:48.420]   Please come back.
[01:50:48.420 --> 01:50:49.980]   We would love to have you on this show on a regular basis.
[01:50:49.980 --> 01:50:50.980]   You're just fantastic.
[01:50:50.980 --> 01:50:51.980]   It was fun.
[01:50:51.980 --> 01:50:53.420]   Thank you for joining us.
[01:50:53.420 --> 01:51:00.060]   Daring fireball.net, Alex is pixel core.tv and Alex Lindsey is the same person.
[01:51:00.060 --> 01:51:01.740]   Andy Anaco, however, is not.
[01:51:01.740 --> 01:51:05.060]   And Andy is on the Chicago Sun Times editorial board.
[01:51:05.060 --> 01:51:07.700]   Actually, are you on the editorial board?
[01:51:07.700 --> 01:51:09.620]   Let's say I'm on the editorial board.
[01:51:09.620 --> 01:51:11.620]   That sounds really cool.
[01:51:11.620 --> 01:51:13.180]   I just made that up.
[01:51:13.180 --> 01:51:16.020]   I'm there taking journalism to the streets, taking it back.
[01:51:16.020 --> 01:51:17.020]   Yeah, baby.
[01:51:17.020 --> 01:51:18.020]   Yeah, baby.
[01:51:18.020 --> 01:51:19.020]   All right, Andy.
[01:51:19.020 --> 01:51:20.020]   The fact that you can fight yourself.
[01:51:20.020 --> 01:51:22.500]   I made you not go for the Chicago Sun.
[01:51:22.500 --> 01:51:28.340]   These vlog is www.cwob that says for celestial waste of bandwidth.com.
[01:51:28.340 --> 01:51:29.780]   You might check that out too.
[01:51:29.780 --> 01:51:31.780]   And Andy, are you going to see?
[01:51:31.780 --> 01:51:32.780]   Yes.
[01:51:32.780 --> 01:51:33.780]   I can't remember.
[01:51:33.780 --> 01:51:34.780]   I'm not.
[01:51:34.780 --> 01:51:37.540]   I thought about it, but then I realized that this is the first this is I'm not joking.
[01:51:37.540 --> 01:51:38.540]   I actually had to count it up.
[01:51:38.540 --> 01:51:44.020]   This is the first time in my entire adult life when I've got like the week after Christmas,
[01:51:44.020 --> 01:51:46.020]   I do not have to prepare for a big break.
[01:51:46.020 --> 01:51:48.860]   And I'm going to screw it up to go to CES.
[01:51:48.860 --> 01:51:49.860]   No.
[01:51:49.860 --> 01:51:52.460]   Well, that's my excuse for why I haven't been in six years is that I always had to get
[01:51:52.460 --> 01:51:53.660]   at, you know, go to that Mac.
[01:51:53.660 --> 01:51:55.620]   That's why I felt like I had to go to.
[01:51:55.620 --> 01:51:58.820]   But I'm like, no, I was just thinking I was just thinking of the weekend.
[01:51:58.820 --> 01:52:02.860]   If this were any other year, I'd be spending this weekend packing for Mac world.
[01:52:02.860 --> 01:52:03.860]   Right.
[01:52:03.860 --> 01:52:06.140]   Instead, I'm in my nightgown.
[01:52:06.140 --> 01:52:07.220]   I'm in my fuzzy robe.
[01:52:07.220 --> 01:52:08.900]   I'm in my little Scrooge cap.
[01:52:08.900 --> 01:52:09.900]   Celebrating a hot.
[01:52:09.900 --> 01:52:11.060]   Isn't that weird?
[01:52:11.060 --> 01:52:14.420]   It is kind of weird because it's like I've it for us, it's gotten to the point where
[01:52:14.420 --> 01:52:18.660]   to me Mac world is the punctuation market, the end of the holiday season.
[01:52:18.660 --> 01:52:23.260]   It's like you do Thanksgiving and then you do your shopping and then you got to do that
[01:52:23.260 --> 01:52:28.060]   real quick Christmas and and all the relatives and New Year's and then boom, you're going
[01:52:28.060 --> 01:52:29.740]   to Mac world and it's just it is.
[01:52:29.740 --> 01:52:30.740]   It feels weird.
[01:52:30.740 --> 01:52:34.940]   I know I have to admit, I was noticing that I was like, why do I feel so like like there's
[01:52:34.940 --> 01:52:38.460]   just this huge gap this week, you know, and just this constant like whatever, because
[01:52:38.460 --> 01:52:40.140]   it's always so stressful.
[01:52:40.140 --> 01:52:43.300]   I mean, it's been last my blood pressure one 20 over 80.
[01:52:43.300 --> 01:52:44.300]   So really.
[01:52:44.300 --> 01:52:45.300]   Yeah.
[01:52:45.300 --> 01:52:48.180]   So my body, body to tensed up and there's nothing to tense for.
[01:52:48.180 --> 01:52:52.100]   And so now I'm just like, well, we're tents for CES and I'm going to tense again because
[01:52:52.100 --> 01:52:53.100]   we're doing Mac world live.
[01:52:53.100 --> 01:52:56.060]   I'm taking over from David Pogue who's going to do the big keynote at Mac world.
[01:52:56.060 --> 01:52:58.100]   So we'll be at Mac world.
[01:52:58.100 --> 01:52:59.100]   So why?
[01:52:59.100 --> 01:53:00.100]   Yeah, that's going to be fun.
[01:53:00.100 --> 01:53:01.100]   In force.
[01:53:01.100 --> 01:53:02.100]   You're doing something really cool.
[01:53:02.100 --> 01:53:04.620]   You're doing more Mac world than we are and we're doing more at CES than you are.
[01:53:04.620 --> 01:53:05.620]   So it's kind of even worse out.
[01:53:05.620 --> 01:53:06.620]   We're swapping out.
[01:53:06.620 --> 01:53:08.740]   We're going to kind of do just the Mac world live there.
[01:53:08.740 --> 01:53:11.740]   I like the Mac world because Mac world is three blocks from my office.
[01:53:11.740 --> 01:53:13.980]   It's an easy one to cover.
[01:53:13.980 --> 01:53:15.500]   Yeah, we're going to put a lot of people on it.
[01:53:15.500 --> 01:53:16.500]   We're going to do it there.
[01:53:16.500 --> 01:53:18.500]   Welcome to Mr. Lindsey's neighborhood.
[01:53:18.500 --> 01:53:19.500]   Yeah.
[01:53:19.500 --> 01:53:20.500]   All right, everybody.
[01:53:20.500 --> 01:53:22.500]   Thank you for joining us.
[01:53:22.500 --> 01:53:24.980]   You better get back to work because break time is over.
