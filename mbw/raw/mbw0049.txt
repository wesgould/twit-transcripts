[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   It's time for Macbreak Weekly, Episode 49.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   We're almost to our 50th, which means we're very close to, you know,
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   and this might even be our anniversary since I think we missed a few.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   Do you remember when we first started this, Alex?
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   It was your, it was you started it.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   I think it was very close to a year ago.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   I think we've only missed a couple, you know, handful of them.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   Well, let me, let me, let me, yeah, see, I can go to
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   twit.tv/mbw1 and see, our first episode was August 12th.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   So it was a WWDC episode with Amber, David,
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   Poe, Chris, Breen, Alex, Lindsay, and Leo, Leforte.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   No, Scott, Borne.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   No, I wasn't invited to the party till late.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   Really?
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   I didn't know that.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   You seem like so much a part of it.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   I came, actually, I started by filling in for you.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   Oh, yeah, Episode 2.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   Yeah.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   I wasn't there, but you were.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   And then you were there for Episode 3, I wasn't there, but you were.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   Mm-hmm.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   And then, not that this is any interest to anybody.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   But anyway, we're here now, and that's what really matters.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   We didn't, we didn't.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   I distinctly remember being told how badly I sucked compared to you, which
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   was very invigorating.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Oh, you don't read those comments, do you?
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Not really.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   You know, I went through a little period, a little sniff fit last week where I turned
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   off the comments.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   I was just getting so frustrated.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   And then I realized you can't turn off comments.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   You just don't have to read them.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   Well, what I feel, I feel like people go to the website.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   You know, they never heard, whatever, for some reason they found it or heard about it.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   They go to the website and they say, "Oh, this is cool.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Look at all these podcasts."
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   They click on a link.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   They read the comments, "This shows the worst show ever.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   This show sucks.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Never listen to this show."
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   And it's like, "Well, come on.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   I shouldn't really probably put that on the front page."
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Maybe bury that in the forum somewhere.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   So, constructive criticism, gang.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   That's all we ask.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   My favorites are when you, when you, when you, something goes wrong and it doesn't get
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   into the feed and it's like people are clutching for oxygen.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   I know.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   They're like, "Dah, in a way, that's good.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   I mean, I want them to feel it."
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   Seriously, Leo, where, where?
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   It's sweet though.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   That means, you know what that means?
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   That's the first world problem, Leo.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   That means people are emotionally engaged.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   I agree.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   But when, like, I'm looking at "Twit 105" and the very first comment you see is "Boring
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   Ugg."
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   I think this episode has made it as the second worst "Twit."
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   See that to me, you know, it's not going to really encourage people to listen.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   And by the way, it was a great show.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   You see the article in "The New York Times" magazine this weekend about "Threadless."
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Maybe it was last week.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   But it was an interesting article about "Threadless" and about how they picked the T-shirts.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   And one of the things that factors into the shirts that they decide to buy or they decide
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   to run are not just the ones that get all fives.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   They look for ones that get a huge number of fives and a huge number of zeros.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   And that's how they know they're going to make some kind of a connection.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   You want to piss people off.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   You want to have them emotional.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   So screw you.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   I hate you too.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   I hate the sh- you, you are the worst audience ever.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   See, maybe I'm really getting angry.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   And then, you know, that doesn't work.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   Be sure to identify yourself, Leo, while you're going through this.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   And write to Scott Borne, because it's his fault.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   Well, you'll fix all this in post, right, Leo?
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Yeah, I always do that.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   You know that.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   I just edit it a lot.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   You're good about that fixing in post.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   So, now, Annie is not here.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   So we could speak freely about this.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   Is Annie Inako the fake Steve?
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   He could be.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   He's got the tone of such a good writer.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   Well, Andy is a very, very, very good writer, and Andy's very, very funny.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   And he knows really the subject matter.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   So here's the deal.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   It's from the siting blog says, it's because he has an IP address in Boston.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   Exactly.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   Where Andy is.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   And goodness knows that there's only one IP address in all of Boston.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   Well, I could find out what Annie's IP address is.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   That would be easy.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Well, don't you think that Andy's smart enough that if it's him, he's going to mask his IP address?
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   Absolutely.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   I don't think it is, Andy.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   I have to say, I mean, having read, I love fake Steve.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   And he's very funny, but it is not Andy's finely tuned wit, to be honest with you.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   Well, do we really care?
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   I mean, we're enjoying it.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Who cares?
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   It's sort of like, you know, who cares who the mac-a-lope is.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   We like the mac-a-lope.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   We never know who the mac-a-lope is.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.080]   Well, it's going to be a lot easier now because I have spies sitting outside the front door
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.080]   at CNET every day.
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.080]   This guy gets his check someday.
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:18.520]   And they're going to wait for a guy that walks in with antlers and we're going to say, "Busted."
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.160]   So fakesteve is fakesteve.blogspot.com.
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.160]   Well worth reading.
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.720]   I don't think it's Andy.
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.280]   It's somebody in Boston perhaps, but I don't think it's Andy.
[00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.800]   Some people think it's Merlin.
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.400]   They think that we thought the mac-a-lope was you until we saw you in the same place.
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.400]   I think any kind of slightly funny anonymous thing might seem to be me.
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.400]   But if it's not particularly funny, it might be me.
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.320]   The slightly funny anonymous thing.
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.320]   You mean 43 folders?
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.320]   Yeah, right.
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.680]   Well, I mean, I write in the Merlin persona there, sure.
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:46.680]   There you go.
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.840]   And that guy, that guy's a dude.
[00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.800]   Obviously, I'm not really like that.
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:51.800]   Clearly.
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:57.120]   So it's been a while since we've talked, iPhone, any updates.
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.760]   Scott Bourne, you still love it?
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:59.760]   I still love it.
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:00.760]   Merlin, man.
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:01.760]   You still hate it?
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:02.760]   I don't hate it.
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:03.760]   I don't have it.
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:08.120]   I watched my friend today downtown trying to use pinching, trying to find the restaurant
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.120]   that we were looking for.
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.720]   And the Edge network was not being friendly.
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.880]   I think we all can safely say we all hate Edge.
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.040]   But I prefer Wi-Fi.
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:18.040]   Yeah.
[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:21.120]   I guess I would say that it's better than nothing, but not much.
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.120]   Not much.
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:26.560]   You know, it is nice that there's something available when I'm not around a Wi-Fi.
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.200]   I was in New Mexico about 10 days ago.
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.440]   And needed to find where I was in the middle of nowhere.
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:37.840]   And was able to, not in the middle of nowhere, but in an area that wasn't going to have
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.640]   Wi-Fi.
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:43.200]   And it was very useful to have the Edge, even if it was slow, because otherwise it would
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.200]   still be good.
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.200]   True.
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:47.200]   Hey, can you remove your muff?
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.200]   It's gone.
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.200]   There's no muff.
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.200]   There's no muff.
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.200]   You send muff old.
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.200]   Hold on.
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.200]   How's that?
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.200]   That's all right.
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.200]   I just just sent a little muff.
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.200]   Old.
[00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:57.200]   Does that sound better?
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.200]   Papa P for me.
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:59.400]   See, he's got the muff on that.
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:00.400]   Hey, no poppin'.
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:01.400]   Muff on.
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.560]   You're just a good non-P-puffer.
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:05.560]   So you're right.
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.320]   It is better than nothing, but just barely.
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:09.320]   It's so hard.
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:13.760]   You know, part of the problem is you can do so much so quickly on that thing that you
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:14.760]   can over-tax it.
[00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:15.760]   For instance, I love it.
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:20.000]   The more I use it, the more I love this, the way they handle tabbing in Safari, where
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.120]   you can open multiple pages.
[00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:26.480]   But it's a great temptation then to open multiple pages.
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.320]   It doesn't seem to, and we talked about this last week, it doesn't seem to cash them,
[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:30.320]   which drives me crazy.
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:34.120]   The thing that I'd really love to see is especially with the Google Maps, I really
[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.120]   would love.
[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:38.800]   I'd love to be able to say I want to give you a gigabyte of my hard drive space or 500
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:42.360]   megs of my hard drive space for Maps so that I can, when I'm surfing around looking
[00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.880]   for the area I'm about to go, just have it keep it there.
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:45.880]   Cash it.
[00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:50.600]   So that I can actually find it again really, really quickly when I'm on the road and that
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:51.760]   way I don't have to deal with Edge.
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:56.160]   I wouldn't feel Edge as much because the number one thing I use the Edge for is when
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:57.760]   I'm somewhere I need a map.
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:58.760]   Right.
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:07:59.760]   That's exactly right.
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:03.640]   Scott, we thought there'd be an update back before now, yes?
[00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:09.800]   Yeah, but it turns out that they've discovered a 68 repeatable bugs.
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:13.840]   So I think that they might have decided that they might have well, might have well,
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:14.840]   catch them.
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:17.480]   Now most of these are the kind of bugs that you can like, yeah, I can prove there's a
[00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:19.440]   bug here and it doesn't matter.
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:20.440]   It doesn't affect any of the kinds of--
[00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:22.080]   Your cosmetic or, yeah.
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:24.600]   Is that number from Apple?
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:30.680]   That number is from applehound.com and the guy there did a pretty scientific approach
[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:34.960]   and I tested him to see if he was just a hater or if he was a guy that really wanted
[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:39.200]   to help and he had sent the bug list to Apple which made me think he was pretty accurate.
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:43.080]   We were able to repeat most of them here although I was not able to duplicate all of
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:50.080]   them but I'm just guessing here, you know, but I know that they-- if you remember back
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:53.520]   to the pre-launch talk, everybody was, oh, you're going to have to do a firmware update
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:54.520]   right in the store.
[00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:55.520]   Is that conversation?
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:56.760]   Yeah, not so.
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:00.400]   Not so and I think where that came from though is that they were aware that there were some
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:05.640]   stuff that needed to be fixed but they used the guy Kawasaki method which is, it's okay
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:06.960]   to ship crap.
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:09.680]   Oh, and that's a strong word, it's not--
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:11.080]   It's a very strong word obviously.
[00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:12.080]   There's nothing crappy here.
[00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:14.440]   I haven't found any bugs that make me go.
[00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:15.440]   Gosh.
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:16.640]   No, but using that it was very--
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:17.640]   Showstops.
[00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:21.440]   That they just decided to go ahead and go with it and they'll fix it and we know it'll
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:22.440]   be coming.
[00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:23.640]   It's just a matter of what day.
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:27.360]   I keep looking, I keep hoping because there's features I know they're going to add.
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:30.680]   It's not that I want bug fixes, I just want to see some new features.
[00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:31.680]   How about I chat?
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:32.680]   Will that make you happy?
[00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:33.680]   Would make me very happy.
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:34.800]   Okay, well just hold on.
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:39.480]   We also know that Leopard will bring some features like syncing to-do lists, syncing,
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:42.120]   notepad, those kinds of things.
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:44.560]   So there's going to be this special report fix.
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:46.280]   I don't know if they'll fix it.
[00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:49.040]   You know, I think it's-- people are making me think I'm crazy because I mean at least
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:53.040]   three-quarters of my mail now is saying that I can type "l'port" and the Inako has just
[00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:55.960]   sent me an email and said "l'port, l'port, l'port, l'port, l'port, l'port."
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:56.960]   Sent from my iPhone.
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:59.400]   "l'port, l'port, l'port, l'port, l'port, l'port."
[00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:00.560]   I know you could type "l'port."
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:02.160]   I'm not saying you can't type "l'port."
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:03.960]   I'm just saying it's a little harder.
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:08.440]   Some words, the words that aren't in the dictionary, I guess what's happening and you
[00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:09.760]   confirm this, right, Scott?
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.440]   It shrinks the keys for letters.
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:13.840]   It doesn't think you really want to type at this point.
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:17.840]   That's right and in the same space, it increases the size of the letters.
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:19.160]   It thinks that you want to type.
[00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:20.160]   So it's--
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:21.160]   So it's--
[00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:22.440]   And we've all gotten together.
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:26.080]   We're starting a blog where we're going to suggest different names you might change
[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:27.080]   your name.
[00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:28.080]   Thank you.
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:29.080]   Yeah, because l'port's not working, so I'm going to type.
[00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:30.080]   I like the iPhone so much.
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:31.080]   I'm changing my name.
[00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:34.880]   That's not when we all have to adapt to the technology.
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:39.440]   Well, and that's what I've learned is that we all thought the computer should adapt to
[00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:40.440]   humans wrong.
[00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:41.440]   What about Leo Korte?
[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:42.440]   Have you thought about that?
[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:45.440]   That's how I became Alex.
[00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:46.440]   Really?
[00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:50.960]   Because of technology, my entire childhood I was known as Ben.
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:51.960]   Come on.
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:52.960]   No, I would--
[00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:53.960]   Don't do that to me, man.
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:54.960]   You're twisting my mind.
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:55.960]   You freaking me out, Alex.
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:56.960]   You totally freaking me out.
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:01.040]   And what happened was is that when I got to college, all the computer program, all the
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:04.280]   computer stuff with my name on it all came up as Alexander Lindsey.
[00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:06.560]   So when the teacher asked, "What do you want to be called?" and I'd say, "Ben," and they
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:08.640]   get confused and they would never remember.
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:10.480]   And so then I just changed it to Alex.
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:11.480]   And when--
[00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:12.480]   Oh my god.
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:13.480]   Because it was my-- Ben's my middle name.
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:14.480]   Wow.
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:17.880]   So that was me changing my name to fit into technology.
[00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:19.960]   I just want to show that as a good example for you, Leo.
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:20.920]   Dude.
[00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:21.920]   I'm not sure what I've done.
[00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:22.920]   Your real name is Ben?
[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:24.920]   When did you think Ben?
[00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:25.920]   Dude.
[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:26.920]   I had no idea.
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:30.080]   If I go home, if I go home, everyone knows me as Ben.
[00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:36.200]   In fact, I'm pretty sure that Alex was the inspiration for that famous Michael Jackson
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:37.200]   hit.
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:40.400]   Ben, you know I'm leaving.
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:43.880]   It's funny because my name is "Unking-Glo-Baa."
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:50.520]   And but I stopped using that because the professors in college, same thing.
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:53.840]   They said, "Unbolo-Aaaah!" or "Unking-Molo-A-Gink."
[00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:54.840]   And it was--
[00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:57.640]   Just that one time they said, "If you'd like to be called something different, let us
[00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:58.640]   know."
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:00.800]   And you said, "I'm sick of the click language, please."
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:01.800]   Leo.
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:02.800]   Call me Quirty.
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:03.800]   Quirty.
[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:04.800]   Leo Quirty.
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:05.800]   That's my new name.
[00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:06.800]   Call me Quirty.
[00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:07.800]   And call me Quirty.
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:09.960]   And now you know we're going to call Alex Ben from now on.
[00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:11.680]   I'm so going to call you Ben now.
[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:12.680]   Ben.
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:14.680]   Get confused in the office because we already have a Ben.
[00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:17.880]   Ben's also the creepy guy on "Lost."
[00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:18.880]   Yeah.
[00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:19.880]   Ooh.
[00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:22.920]   I haven't we long gone past the point at which the rat hole music should be playing.
[00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:23.920]   Yeah, long gone.
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:25.280]   No, this is "Rattle Relevant."
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:28.120]   This has to do with typing on the iPhone.
[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:30.120]   Okay, just checking.
[00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:39.560]   And a study from Mac Daily News, actually published by Mac Daily News, according to Interprett.
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:40.720]   Probably not how it's pronounced, but--
[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:42.400]   I think it's "Interprett."
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:43.400]   Interprett.
[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:44.400]   I think it's "Entrepre."
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:45.400]   Interprett.
[00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:46.400]   Interprett.
[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:53.200]   The iPhone is going to be a catalyst for mobile video growth because 63% of iPhone users have
[00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:57.160]   already used the wide screen enabled device to watch video compared to 28% of regular
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:01.320]   cell phone users and half-- actually, little more than half of iPhone users have watched
[00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:03.320]   YouTube on their phone.
[00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:05.280]   I'm guilty on both counts.
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:07.360]   46% have watched a music video.
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:09.280]   Can't say I've done that.
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:10.920]   34% have watched the news.
[00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:11.920]   What news?
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:14.240]   Let me watch the news.
[00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:15.640]   I don't know what they're talking about.
[00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:17.360]   There's no live stuff on there.
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:19.280]   Is there news on YouTube?
[00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:21.320]   You can watch replays of news.
[00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:22.320]   Yeah, I guess you could.
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:23.600]   I have the 60 Minutes podcast on there.
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:25.520]   I guess that qualifies.
[00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:26.520]   Although it's audio.
[00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:28.840]   And 32% have already watched a movie trailer.
[00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:30.480]   Yeah, it's a-- you know what?
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:35.280]   I show-- when people-- there's certain things you do when you do an iPhone demo.
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:39.240]   The first thing I do is the photo album and I've got it all down now.
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:40.240]   You do the photo album.
[00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:44.560]   They love the-- you know, you flick it with a finger and then you get to a picture that's
[00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:46.200]   not portrait mode.
[00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:48.120]   So you turn the thing and suddenly it's landscape.
[00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:49.640]   They go, ooh.
[00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:51.040]   And then I flip again and then I say, wait a minute.
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:54.840]   I can't quite see who that is and I do the pinch.
[00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:56.320]   And they go, ooh.
[00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:57.760]   And then I say, let me show you video.
[00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:01.320]   So that's where I really high up in that demo thing because they love the video looks
[00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:02.320]   great.
[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:04.080]   I almost got sold last night.
[00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:07.760]   I was at dinner and my friend whipped that as I have phone and handed it to me.
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:09.240]   And he had told me he was going to do this.
[00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:13.920]   He's ripped the entire first season of HR puffing stuff and has a live life.
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:16.720]   So I sat there and watched the intro and it looked beautiful.
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:18.240]   Oh, that's good.
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:19.240]   I was saying--
[00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:22.040]   It's not-- it took Sid and Marty Croft to almost sell me.
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:24.520]   You know, I will say that also if you're looking for things that look really, really
[00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:30.040]   good on your iPhone, the Johnny Quest looks exceptional on your iPhone.
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:34.200]   If they ever put bananas at large on there, it's all over for me.
[00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:37.320]   I have on there a Japanese-- actually, it's really great.
[00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:43.320]   Sean Carruthers up in Vancouver now who's kind of a connoisseur.
[00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:45.040]   You would like-- you know Sean.
[00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:46.040]   I know Sean.
[00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:47.040]   Yeah, both of them.
[00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:48.040]   Sean.
[00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:50.400]   He's the connoisseur of the obscure, the weird, the Japanese.
[00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:55.720]   He has a DVD of some Japanese kids show called "Sweet Chee" that--
[00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:57.760]   Oh my god, so amazing.
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:58.920]   You've seen these?
[00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:00.920]   We were watching it on the set last week.
[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:01.920]   Well, that's right.
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:06.320]   It's Rube Goldberg-like marble domino machines.
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:07.880]   And I guess I use them as bumpers in the show.
[00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:11.880]   And he gave me the DVD and I put it on my iPhone and it's a great demo because it's
[00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:14.000]   a very detailed-- you want to see the details of what's going on.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.800]   You can see it beautifully on the screen.
[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:17.520]   They should really podcast those or something because it's--
[00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:18.520]   They should.
[00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:19.520]   There's hundreds of them.
[00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:20.520]   Yeah, there's hundreds of them.
[00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:21.520]   And they're so amazing.
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:25.960]   I mean, it's-- anyway, it's a little-- it seems-- it seems a little attack, but very, very
[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:26.960]   cool.
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:28.960]   [SINGING]
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:31.320]   And now, even though I've never been to Japan, I'm singing that song.
[00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:32.760]   I can't always speak Japanese.
[00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:34.360]   So it works.
[00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:36.680]   So practice saying what karimasen.
[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:39.440]   I think that one of the other things that's going to be interesting about the video is
[00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:42.680]   that because we're spending so much time clicking on the screen, of course, this is the
[00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:45.380]   thing that I pay attention to is because we're spending so much time clicking on the
[00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:49.640]   screen and we're watching video, the idea of interactive video I think becomes more
[00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:50.640]   and more relevant.
[00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:51.640]   It would be good for you, won't it?
[00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:56.360]   Yeah, because I think that as you start to be able to wire that in, you're going to
[00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:59.000]   be able to really be able to click on a lot of the stuff that you're interested in.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.440]   And because we're doing it so much with the apparatus that we have, I think we're more
[00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:05.240]   likely to jump on that.
[00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:08.760]   And so I think it's going to be a really interesting situation as that starts to move
[00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:09.760]   forward.
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:12.760]   I think the iPhone haters are really going to hate this, but I really do think that we
[00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:13.760]   are.
[00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:19.360]   And this is the point of that interpret study is that it's going to change the way people
[00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:20.360]   use phones.
[00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:24.360]   And I think the iPhone is going to be that kind of landmark device that you were saying,
[00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:27.760]   Scott Born, where it's really is going to change how people think about their-- it won't
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:28.760]   be a phone.
[00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:30.760]   It'll be a thing.
[00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:31.760]   Computer in their pocket.
[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:36.040]   And one of the things that I thought was really interesting-- I was talking to someone last
[00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:39.520]   week about this-- that one of the things we noticed was how much of our phone we're actually
[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:40.520]   using, how much of the iPhone.
[00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:45.960]   I mean, my old phones, I spent a lot of money on a trio and I first came out and barely
[00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:47.640]   used any of the features.
[00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:52.320]   And I use most of what the iPhone does almost on a daily basis.
[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:55.160]   And I think part of that is, of course, that the interface is great and all that stuff.
[00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:59.600]   But I think a key part of it is that Apple spent so much time on all these videos before
[00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:03.680]   we bought the phone that by the time we picked the phone up, we already knew where everything
[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:05.480]   was and how to click on it and what to do.
[00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:10.640]   And I think that beyond whether the iPhone is good or not, I think overall for electronic
[00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:14.360]   makers-- I mean, I think a lot of times we get these things and we never use them because
[00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:17.920]   we don't know where to go and we never have time to make that work.
[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:22.040]   I think that that was a really, really strong move by Apple to put out a 20 or 30 minute
[00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:23.640]   movie about how to use it.
[00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:24.640]   Yeah.
[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:25.640]   And I don't think it's a phone.
[00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:26.640]   I think it's a computer.
[00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:28.680]   Yeah, I think that's the point, really.
[00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:29.680]   It's a phone, certainly.
[00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:31.680]   And a good phone.
[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:35.120]   But it's the emails growing on me.
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:36.120]   I'm using that a lot.
[00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:41.560]   Well, you know, the model for the usability was Merlin's that phone guy.
[00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:44.240]   They wanted something as easy as an imaginary phone.
[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:45.840]   Well, for reasons I'm sure you can understand.
[00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:48.360]   I can't go into a lot of detail on that.
[00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:50.000]   But there were discussions about form factor.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.480]   We drilled down on some things.
[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:53.960]   Can I ask a question to you, fanboys?
[00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:55.320]   What are you doing?
[00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:57.800]   How are you tracking tasks?
[00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:58.800]   Have we talked about this already?
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:00.840]   There's no to do capabilities and it throws you crazy.
[00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:04.200]   Do you do, do you're using web apps or using like a text file kind of thing?
[00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:09.680]   Well, I, there is a way to do to do is it's kind of a clue, G. But what I do is I have
[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:12.560]   a contact I call to do.
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:18.000]   And then I type stuff in there and then it syncs with my computer as an address.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.680]   And then I'm able to look at that when I sync and pull those out and drop them into
[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:22.680]   my regular to do.
[00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:25.480]   And you could use, remember the milk or other to do list sites.
[00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:27.960]   But you know, Jot is good for this as well.
[00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:30.600]   And that's something you turned us on to Merlin.
[00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:32.520]   So but I mean, you do need.
[00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:33.960]   There's something missing.
[00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:34.960]   Well, sure.
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:35.960]   I will call Jot.
[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:36.960]   I will use Jot.
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:39.120]   But, and then I'll have Jot go to my Yahoo mail.
[00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:43.400]   Well, and I have to say, I mean, just to, you know, be the minority opinion on this one
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:47.440]   thing, I think that the excuse or the explanation that, oh gosh, don't worry, it's coming in
[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:48.440]   leopard.
[00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:49.440]   It's all going to be integrated.
[00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:52.280]   Well, I know that for a fact because it's it.
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:53.880]   Leopard mail has to do in it.
[00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:54.880]   Yeah, it does.
[00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:58.920]   But the I'm just I'm just curious though, because when I talk about this a little bit
[00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:01.680]   on the site, there's some pretty good solutions out there.
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:05.720]   A lot of people are using, but there are a lot of them are, you know, wireless or that,
[00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:07.520]   you know, they're yeah, you have to use a website.
[00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:10.080]   Yeah, I can't remember the milk or something.
[00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:11.080]   I agree with you.
[00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:12.280]   It's not a it's not a good solution.
[00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:14.080]   I'm very very reliable.
[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:16.080]   The notes functionality is pretty fun.
[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:17.080]   Right.
[00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:18.080]   It's pretty it's pretty basic.
[00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:19.080]   It's real basic.
[00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:21.280]   It's like a all memo pad kind of functionality.
[00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:22.680]   Yeah, which is adequate.
[00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:25.160]   I'm not that's that's okay if it would sink.
[00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:27.360]   I don't know why it doesn't sink to stickies.
[00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:28.920]   It was it's just one of those.
[00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:33.320]   It's an oversight and it should have been built in and you got to imagine there was some
[00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:34.680]   reason they didn't include it.
[00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:35.680]   But I agree.
[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:38.880]   It's it's a, you know, it's something that I wish it had.
[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:39.880]   Simple thing.
[00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:42.720]   Then you put it to listen stickies and it would automatically sink and.
[00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:45.600]   I really I really as part of that is the color of my crystal is the kind of thing that it
[00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:51.000]   would be your thing, of course, my thing is, you know, contextual access to my actions.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.880]   But yeah, it'll be interesting to see what they do with that.
[00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:58.240]   And I got to say, I said this a long time ago, I continue to be interested in seeing where
[00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:00.520]   they take the whole notion of sync from here.
[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:05.040]   Because it just seems to me, I mean, we talked about how now you can do your jumbo notes,
[00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:07.240]   you know, with missing sync.
[00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:10.000]   I think it's I think it's going to be fascinating to watch where they go with that.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.840]   And that's that to me is one of the most we talk about this being a computer on the
[00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:13.840]   go.
[00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:18.080]   I think not having that need for connectivity all the time is is potentially where a lot
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:19.080]   of it's at.
[00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:20.080]   There's no question.
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:25.080]   I think as you know, here we are, we're really doing a postmortem four weeks later, three
[00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:26.080]   weeks later.
[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:31.840]   And I mean, I think what's become clear is that for what it does, it does it very well.
[00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:34.320]   And I don't see a lot of people who are unhappy with.
[00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:40.440]   In fact, a study just published said it's something like 91% of iPhone users were were
[00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:41.440]   satisfying.
[00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:42.680]   I mean, very high satisfaction.
[00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:43.680]   Right.
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:48.720]   I'd say that there's definitely a ton of stuff that jumps into my head of things that
[00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:51.520]   I want to see, but it's still the best phone I've ever had.
[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:52.520]   Yeah.
[00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:55.480]   Well, that's not saying much because most phones are crappy, but but people ask me,
[00:20:55.480 --> 00:21:00.040]   are you going to go back to your N95 and as you know, 95 has so many more features,
[00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:05.240]   GPS, five megapixel camera, video shooting, voice recording, voice dialing.
[00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:10.440]   I mean, on and on and on and yet no, I'm not going to go back.
[00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:14.040]   I wasn't going to mention this one post because it has has the S word in it.
[00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:19.800]   Right now, the most popular post on dig in the Apple section is from Maddox, the funny
[00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:21.480]   man, best page in the universe guy.
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:26.560]   And the title title of the post is the iPhone is a piece of something and so is your face.
[00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:31.080]   And it's had 12,000 digs so far and he goes in and he's trying to do it head to head with
[00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:33.320]   the Nokia E70.
[00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:34.320]   That's cool.
[00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:35.520]   That is a very nice smartphone.
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:39.760]   It looks like, you know, it's, he's, you know, obviously he's, you know, taking the
[00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:42.360]   Mickey out of people here with this, but it is kind of fun.
[00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:45.160]   And I got to tell you, I didn't know the Nokia, this model could actually do all this.
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:48.680]   Can't get it in the US, but it is a very nice phone.
[00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:53.000]   Well, I wonder, I wonder though, I mean, you look at that and the idea, you know, so my
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   friends who have this, of course, like you, they all uniformly love it.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.840]   They tell everybody how much they love it.
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:02.000]   But the pieces that are definitely missing, the keyboard does keep coming up along with
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:08.200]   edge as something that I think is, it's going to be interesting to see what they do to improve
[00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:12.600]   that, that idea of having a modal punctuation seems kind of crazy.
[00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:16.160]   Yeah, punctuation should not be a separate key press away.
[00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:19.840]   That's at least a couple of the, you know, the apostrophe in the period and stuff like
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:20.840]   that.
[00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:23.320]   But I do, I do have to admit I am now typing faster than no, my trio.
[00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:24.320]   Yeah.
[00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:25.320]   I'm not only typing.
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:31.720]   According to USA today in a study actually performed by, who did this?
[00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:32.720]   I don't see.
[00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:41.680]   80% of 200 owners say extremely or very satisfied, 85% extremely or very likely to recommend paid
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:47.240]   for by interpret, interpret, pray of Santa Monica, California.
[00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:49.720]   They surveyed a thousand cell phone users.
[00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:54.600]   And what I would desperately have loved to see was a survey of trio 650 owners right
[00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:55.600]   along side.
[00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:56.600]   Yeah, one would be as high.
[00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:58.800]   Number of people who love their phone for.
[00:22:58.800 --> 00:22:59.800]   Yeah.
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:02.240]   Don't just, don't you think that went on a lot of trioges?
[00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:03.800]   I like my palm a lot.
[00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:04.800]   I really do.
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:10.480]   But I think what the world is rapidly polarizing very dramatically between iPhone lovers and
[00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:12.200]   iPhone haters.
[00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:15.280]   And most of the haters are hating because they just can't be caught dead.
[00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:17.880]   I think people are really sick of it.
[00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:20.200]   Hey, I just, God, I so disagree with that, Scott.
[00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:22.400]   It's just, it's just a, it's a freaking phone.
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:23.400]   It's nice.
[00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:24.560]   It's a really nice phone.
[00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:26.360]   But not everybody needs that particular phone.
[00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:29.160]   I know a lot of people who are like sales people.
[00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:32.400]   And the idea of having that kind of a keyboard for typing is making them like lose their
[00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:33.400]   mind.
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:34.400]   Yeah.
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:39.400]   And so I mean, you know, I'm terrible at this.
[00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:44.640]   They're saying what if you had to predict what in particular this is going to cause other
[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:48.040]   companies to change and to do differently.
[00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:52.440]   Oh, you're already seeing response from many other cell phone companies touch screens.
[00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:53.840]   You think touch screen?
[00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:54.840]   Yeah.
[00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:59.840]   And then you can also see that the phone is going to be on the phone.

[00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:31.840]   But that's my opinion. We are kind of cocky about it. Most of us.
[00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:33.840]   We haven't had the problem for years.
[00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:37.840]   In the production environment, we were working on a project for VH1.
[00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:39.840]   It was so funny. We had all these PCs we had to use.
[00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:45.840]   And literally, if a PC touched the internet, we had one intern that plugged the PC into the outside world.
[00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:49.840]   We literally removed the PC and flattened it with a ghost.
[00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:51.840]   Oh, please. That's just silly.
[00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:55.840]   We couldn't afford the thing as if anything spread across the system.
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:57.840]   We were on a tight deadline and it was going to be a bad deal.
[00:27:57.840 --> 00:27:58.840]   That's kind of bad.
[00:27:58.840 --> 00:27:59.840]   Well, all right.
[00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:04.840]   So look, I've been running PCs for -- I haven't had a spyware infestation or a virus in years.
[00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:07.840]   And I've been running PCs on the network for all that time.
[00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:09.840]   I don't think -- I hadn't finished my point yet.
[00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:10.840]   Oh, okay. Go ahead.
[00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:16.840]   The point was that it was funny that we were so cavalier about our Mac and so paranoid about the PC.
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:18.840]   You know, because we don't use the PCs very often.
[00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:19.840]   It's just that there's this terror.
[00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:20.840]   Like, we don't even know what to do.
[00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:25.840]   I don't even know what to do to keep my PC secure because I've never had to do that before.
[00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:29.840]   I don't know what sites I'm not supposed to go to or what I'm not supposed to click on.
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:31.840]   I mean, you know, all that stuff.
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:35.840]   There's a complete -- I think that is where if something happens,
[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:40.840]   there's this complete blind spot for Mac users because we just -- I don't even know what to think about anymore
[00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:43.840]   because it never occurs to me that I have to really think about it much at all.
[00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:44.840]   Yeah.
[00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:45.840]   Well, that's the point, I guess.
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:47.840]   Yes. We're complacent.
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:49.840]   Maybe we shouldn't be so.
[00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:52.840]   But so far, nothing -- you know, you'll believe me.
[00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:57.840]   If there's a big problem, you'll hear about it on this podcast and on the entire Twitch network.
[00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:00.840]   Or you might not hear about it for a little while as we --
[00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:03.840]   Yeah, as we try to figure out how to get back online, right?
[00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:05.840]   Hey, this is a cool link.
[00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:08.840]   It's an mbwideas.com.
[00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:14.840]   It's -- I don't know if these are real or not, but Mac designs from the '80s.
[00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:17.840]   Is this -- have you looked at that yet, guys?
[00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:20.840]   Is this the alternate, the designs they didn't use supposedly?
[00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:21.840]   Supposedly.
[00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:27.840]   I don't -- I can't tell -- I think it's an art joke, but I can't tell.
[00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:30.840]   I want you guys to look at it because I can't quite figure it out.
[00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:32.840]   I'll read you the story.
[00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:38.840]   And you can -- it's somebody -- let me see who gave us this lead by --
[00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:41.840]   This is the one with the Mac Amba.
[00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:43.840]   Yeah, it's the one with the phone.
[00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:46.840]   It's from Futter.de.
[00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:47.840]   Here's the story.
[00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:50.840]   In late June, the iPhone hit the U.S. market.
[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:53.840]   Apple aficionados queued for days to get it.
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:57.840]   But Futter employee -- I think this is a joke.
[00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:02.840]   Mark Esslinger is an Apple fan as well, also because he has a very special relationship to Apple.
[00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:06.840]   His father, Hartmut Esslinger -- this is kind of a joke.
[00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:08.840]   Now that I'm reading it out loud --
[00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:12.840]   Design the famous Apple 2C, which was Apple's first portable computer and a great computer.
[00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:14.840]   We remember that well.
[00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:21.840]   Futter presents Mark's personal Apple story and a photo gallery with partly never before seen Apple designs of the early 80s.
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:27.840]   The first iPhone from '83, which -- do you think these are real or what?
[00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:29.840]   I don't think so.
[00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:30.840]   They're great, though.
[00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:32.840]   It's a very funny article.
[00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:36.840]   Well, they look -- I mean, what's neat about it is it looks like authentic for that time.
[00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:38.840]   You know, here's how I would believe it.
[00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:43.840]   If there were some conceptual drawings of a yellow iPod with Beatles music on it --
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:44.840]   Oh, we got to talk about that.
[00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:47.840]   Then I would think it's real.
[00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:48.840]   Yeah.
[00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:54.840]   So Merlin, this is -- you are now in the echo chamber of fame.
[00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:57.840]   We're enjoying the second wave of BS.
[00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:04.840]   So Merlin, as a joke, I think, created a Mac rumor on this very show some time ago
[00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:09.840]   that there would be a strawberry fields iPod with the Beatles music on it.
[00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:11.840]   I think we collaborated all of us.
[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:12.840]   We helped to build it up.
[00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:16.840]   You carried a lot of the water, apparently.
[00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:20.840]   Joke -- it is something like a real rumor instead of just my speculation.
[00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:21.840]   I said it's got to happen.
[00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:23.840]   It's too true to not be true.
[00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:24.840]   I mean, it's too perfect.
[00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:26.840]   I have to admit, that's kind of how I felt.
[00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:31.840]   As the words were coming out of my mouth, I had this mix of thinking, "Oh, God, why am I even saying this?"
[00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:32.840]   And the same thing going, "You know."
[00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:33.840]   It's not a bad idea.
[00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:34.840]   It's kind of a good idea.
[00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:35.840]   It's a great idea.
[00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:36.840]   And who knows?
[00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:40.840]   It might have been on the drawing board, and then Apple Core just didn't get it together,
[00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:42.840]   because we still don't have Beatles music on iTunes.
[00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:47.840]   Maybe it's lurking somewhere in the vaults in Cupertino.
[00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:52.840]   But it was a great idea picked up as a true rumor and published by many Apple rumors sites,
[00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:56.840]   even though we were just talking out of our -- took us this.
[00:31:56.840 --> 00:32:00.840]   And you know, who needs a fake Steve Jobs when you've got a real Merlin man?
[00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:01.840]   I agree.
[00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:10.840]   So, the rumor's back only now, instead of a Strawberry Fields Forever iPod, it's a yellow submarine
[00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:11.840]   iPod.
[00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:12.840]   Although you might have mentioned a yellow submarine.
[00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:15.840]   I think I might have said yellow submarine, but he did.
[00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:16.840]   He did.
[00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:17.840]   He did.
[00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:18.840]   So it's the same exact rumor.
[00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:19.840]   Yeah.
[00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:20.840]   Yeah.
[00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:21.840]   It's just version 2.0.
[00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:26.840]   It's really -- I think it says a lot about where Mac rumors come from.
[00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:28.840]   I think it's a very important --
[00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:29.840]   It's a testament.
[00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:33.840]   A very important lesson we have all learned here.
[00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:35.840]   You just can't trust it.
[00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:40.840]   I think if it turns out that there is a yellow submarine iPod, I think we're going to cease
[00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:43.840]   to call Merlin and start to call him the Oracle.
[00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:44.840]   The Oracle.
[00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:46.840]   We'll call you Ben, but we'll call him the Oracle.
[00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:50.840]   If they put out a yellow submarine iPod, I think Scott should buy me an iPhone.
[00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:51.840]   No question.
[00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:52.840]   Yes.
[00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:53.840]   I'd prefer a Strawberry Fields iPod, Frank.
[00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:54.840]   Oh, Scott agrees.
[00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:55.840]   Does Scott agree?
[00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:56.840]   I agree.
[00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:57.840]   I agree if they do that.
[00:32:57.840 --> 00:32:58.840]   You should get an iPhone.
[00:32:58.840 --> 00:32:59.840]   I should.
[00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:01.840]   You're playing lawyer balls.
[00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:02.840]   Should.
[00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:04.840]   What's the point of this discussion?
[00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:06.840]   They're not going to do it.
[00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:08.840]   You don't think so?
[00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:09.840]   No.
[00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:10.840]   No, but I agree with you.
[00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:12.840]   I would prefer a Strawberry Fields version.
[00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:13.840]   Yeah.
[00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:15.840]   The yellow submarine was kind of a clunker.
[00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:16.840]   I'm the walrus.
[00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:19.840]   I am the walrus iPod with yellow matter custard on it.
[00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:22.840]   We think we're going to get a boneless iPod soon.
[00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:25.840]   What do you think we're going to wait until the end of the year?
[00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:26.840]   Or do you think we're going to see one?
[00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:27.840]   Never.
[00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:28.840]   Never.
[00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:29.840]   Really?
[00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:31.840]   I think Apple's new...
[00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:35.320]   I'm thinking this as I go along.
[00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:42.640]   But I think Apple's new plan is to move us not to have two product lines, but to move
[00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:45.200]   the iPod to the iPhone.
[00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:46.760]   I actually agree with Leo.
[00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:51.200]   I don't think they're going to ever do a phoneless iPod with that interface.
[00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:55.520]   I think the goal is to get you all using an iPhone.
[00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:57.040]   I do admit.
[00:33:57.040 --> 00:34:01.440]   I have my video iPod with me because it still has a lot more storage.
[00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:04.120]   It really frustrates me to want videos on it now.
[00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:05.120]   It's very sad.
[00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:06.120]   Yeah.
[00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:13.640]   I spent the last week traveling, put a lot of TV on my iPhone and watched it, listened
[00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:15.160]   to a lot of audiobooks.
[00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:17.160]   It is a great iPod.
[00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:18.160]   It really is.
[00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:19.720]   It's a shame that I don't...
[00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:23.320]   Here's the only problem is that you're never going to buy an iPhone if you don't want to
[00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:28.600]   go to AT&T or you're a kid or whatever.
[00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:29.600]   There is a negative to that.
[00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:33.040]   I mean, they would sell a lot more iPods if they'd move this technology over there.
[00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:34.120]   But I really think Apple...
[00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:39.520]   I get the feeling that Apple's leaving, frankly, leaving the iPod behind and moving in that
[00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:40.520]   phone direction.
[00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:43.120]   Well, and I don't think that's going to be an overnight thing.
[00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:48.480]   I think that's a long-scale line when you look at it because they have too much money
[00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:49.480]   coming in on iPods.
[00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:50.480]   That's true.
[00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:51.480]   They can't.
[00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:52.680]   They're not going to quit making iPods.
[00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:56.160]   I think they're going to slow down their R&D on iPods and look at moving those phones.
[00:34:56.160 --> 00:35:02.760]   Would you buy a new iPod of the old form factor knowing that this potentially exists?
[00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:03.760]   Not I wouldn't.
[00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:05.320]   No, you're going to wait.
[00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:08.720]   Well, here's the other question is is that if Apple has a deal with this iPhone, if they
[00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:13.120]   release another iPhone, is it still tied to AT&T?
[00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:15.640]   Is it all phones that Apple makes or just the phone that they released?
[00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:17.480]   Ah, that's interesting.
[00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:22.040]   So we've heard quite a bit about the five-year deal with AT&T, but maybe they could make
[00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:23.680]   a phone that's not AT&T.
[00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:26.800]   I'd be shocked if that happened.
[00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:28.760]   And what would your choices be?
[00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:29.760]   Be T-Mobile.
[00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:31.960]   You've got to be GSM, right?
[00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:33.320]   Yeah, you've got to be.
[00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:35.480]   And they only have Edge too.
[00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:40.080]   So, you know, what's it's like from when I hear you're worse off that way, then you'd
[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:41.080]   be with AT&T.
[00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:45.600]   Now, the other question is, is there anything related to the iPhone with the Google looking
[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:46.600]   at frequencies?
[00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:49.400]   Have you seen that?
[00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:51.000]   No, what's that?
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:55.320]   Google is looking at, you know, they're going to auction off channel 52 to 54.
[00:35:55.320 --> 00:36:03.920]   Oh, this is part of the bandwidth auctions of the spectrum that was freed by the television
[00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:04.920]   stations, right?
[00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:05.920]   Right.
[00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:10.040]   So when they moved everybody to digital TV, part of the reason was to release Spectrum
[00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:15.440]   below 700 megahertz, which is currently occupied to television stations because that's prime
[00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:18.320]   bandwidth that goes through walls, goes through buildings.
[00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:21.480]   You know, you can watch your TV by a 10 almost anywhere.
[00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:24.360]   Those frequencies would be great for some sort of wireless.
[00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:28.640]   So you think Google will bid Google certainly could Google do is talking to I mean, Google
[00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:30.640]   was making a bunch of different.
[00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:33.480]   Oh, if I were Google, I absolutely would do that.
[00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:37.200]   Yeah, because that could obviously very much affect the whole process.
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:39.000]   Then what do they do with it?
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.240]   With a Google phone?
[00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:43.200]   You know, I think that what they're looking at it.
[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:46.000]   I mean, the question is, is whether we really call it a phone anymore.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.320]   Ah, I've got an idea.
[00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:49.320]   Okay.
[00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:51.320]   You're talking about data network that does VoIP and everything else.
[00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:52.320]   Right.
[00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:55.400]   We want to know exactly eliminate cell phones, right?
[00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:58.360]   Get in the Google phone business and it's a VoIP phone.
[00:36:58.360 --> 00:36:59.360]   Yeah.
[00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:02.400]   With Wi-Fi everywhere.
[00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:03.400]   This is the efficiency.
[00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:04.400]   It just becomes a data network.
[00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:05.400]   I mean, it's not.
[00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:08.000]   And who better to partner with on the hardware than Apple?
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.100]   Yeah.
[00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:12.560]   So there's there's there's an interesting rumor we could start, which is an iPhone that
[00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:15.000]   doesn't use cell networks at all.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   I heard the phone is going to be yellow.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:22.360]   I'm going to come with the entire Beatles.
[00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:27.560]   Including all their movies and outtakes from the magical mystery tour movie.
[00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:31.720]   I'd love to see Google's do something like that with or without Apple because we want
[00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:33.960]   to keep competition in the game here.
[00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:38.600]   I mean, the danger I see in the iPhone is going to sound weird coming from me is that
[00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:40.320]   it could be too successful.
[00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:46.240]   In other words, it would destroy competition and then therefore leave no incentive for Apple
[00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:47.240]   to continue to improve it.
[00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:49.080]   I'm with you on that, absolutely.
[00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:50.080]   I want to see.
[00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:54.600]   You can improve the condition of competition in the marketplace by getting Google involved.
[00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:55.880]   No.
[00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:59.400]   That's the problem is that I you know, going forward, let's go out 10 years Google and
[00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:01.440]   Apple are dominant.
[00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:03.080]   Well at least another.
[00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:05.520]   I'm just saying another competitor, Merlin.
[00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:06.520]   But who Microsoft?
[00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:10.920]   But here's the thing that's interesting about what Google's offering is beyond whether they
[00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:14.920]   want to buy something in the 700 megahertz auction.
[00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:18.440]   One of the things that they're asking for is that both they want to ensure that the new
[00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:23.320]   spectrum is offered on an open non-discriminatory basis and to bring new entrants interested
[00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:25.000]   in challenging the curry.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.400]   So one of the things they want to do is make sure that you can't block people from using
[00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:29.400]   your cell network.
[00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:32.440]   So it's actually open whether they buy it or not.
[00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:37.960]   So the idea is that their proposal is that Google can afford this.
[00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:40.320]   Google's the one company that really could afford this.
[00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:43.120]   It's in their interest in preserving net neutrality.
[00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:46.360]   Google's already made assays towards local Wi-Fi.
[00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:50.120]   They're providing the free Wi-Fi in San Francisco right now.
[00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:54.200]   They have server farms that equal just about any cell network out there.
[00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:59.240]   I mean they have like 40 of these huge, crazy warehouses of computers that no one knows
[00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:02.400]   what they're being used for.
[00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:03.400]   They're in their interest.
[00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:06.960]   They said that I think the second largest phone company in Canada has eight and Google
[00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:08.160]   has like 40.
[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:09.160]   Interesting.
[00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:12.400]   I heard Google's going to buy the vowels.
[00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:13.640]   You can't like just...
[00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:16.080]   I heard they were really focusing on the O's myself.
[00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:18.360]   I heard that I heard O's were going to be a no-brainer.
[00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:21.480]   The O's were going to be an out and few end of the game.
[00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:26.960]   But that they were also looking at AEY and possibly WAT.
[00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:27.960]   Yeah.
[00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:28.960]   Oh boy.
[00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:33.640]   Just to put some perspective on the concerns of Google's dominance though, as I remember
[00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:38.160]   a time when a company called Netscape was under the same sort of scrutiny and everyone
[00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:42.480]   said, "Oh, Netscape's going to take over the world and now we know how that worked out."
[00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:45.880]   I don't think we've ever seen anything like Google before, I'll be honest with you.
[00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:46.880]   I don't think so.
[00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:48.280]   But I'm just saying it's in the same vein.
[00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:51.680]   Be careful about assuming that the companies that are dominant today...
[00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:53.480]   Oh, same thing with IBM.
[00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:56.400]   IBM with its monopoly.
[00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:59.800]   They owned the computing in the 50s and 60s and the plug compatibles came along a few
[00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:03.760]   bad court cases and all of a sudden IBM's also ran.
[00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:05.840]   Still around, but they're not microsophistic.
[00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:06.840]   Yeah.
[00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:07.840]   Yeah.
[00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:16.160]   The thing that's interesting about Google is the number of people who they terrify.
[00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:17.160]   I wonder...
[00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:22.400]   I wonder even since Microsoft, I mean, Microsoft at the height of its power, did Microsoft
[00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:23.400]   have the ability?
[00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:24.400]   No.
[00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:25.400]   And I'm talking...
[00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:26.400]   I'm talking about computer here.
[00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:29.680]   We're not talking just about computers and electronic devices.
[00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:33.320]   We're talking about getting into the advertising business.
[00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:38.600]   I mean, you just think about all of the companies to whom Google represents some kind of a
[00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:39.600]   threat.
[00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:40.600]   And it's...
[00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:41.600]   I wonder...
[00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:46.120]   I mean, has there ever been a company that stands to, even with a glancing blow, knock
[00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:48.520]   out so many different industries?
[00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:50.560]   It's kind of freaky.
[00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:52.680]   The interesting thing I think is how much they...
[00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:58.480]   I mean, I guess they are starting to worry the average individual, but I find that they're
[00:40:58.480 --> 00:40:59.480]   not...
[00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:03.080]   That they're really worrying these huge companies more than they're worrying lots of the little
[00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:04.080]   companies.
[00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:05.080]   Yes.
[00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:08.880]   You know, these big companies that are comfortable and think that they're ready to go and so
[00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:09.880]   and so forth.
[00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:10.880]   And now they're getting...
[00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:11.880]   Something's going up the path.
[00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:12.880]   It's very dangerous.
[00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:15.440]   I think in a way I'm rooting for...
[00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:16.440]   You know, this is interesting.
[00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:20.280]   And in a way I'm rooting for Google because they're the young upstarts.
[00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:21.280]   Yeah.
[00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:27.080]   But I'm also realizing that that is a dangerous position.
[00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:31.040]   You know, we all really deepen our hearts, love Google and want them to succeed, don't
[00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:32.040]   you?
[00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:33.040]   Well...
[00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:34.040]   But I'm worried about them now.
[00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:35.280]   I'm getting more and more worried about them.
[00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:36.280]   They get it...
[00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:42.160]   I think that one of the things that's going on is that I always feel like Microsoft is
[00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:46.000]   kind of, you know, it kind of runs itself and it's not in no certain direction.
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   Like they're big and...
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:51.240]   They're so bad at everything that they do that I'm not afraid of them.
[00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:52.240]   Google is so hyper-competent.
[00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:54.280]   Well, that's the whole thing.
[00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:55.280]   That's the same thing with Apple.
[00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:58.440]   It was kind of like if Apple, you know, what Apple would do if it had an...
[00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:00.840]   I'm very happy with Apple having 15...
[00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:04.280]   Apple would shoot itself in the foot too if it had a big market share too.
[00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:06.440]   I'm not as afraid of Apple as I am of Google.
[00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:11.520]   I'll tell you, Apple is actually being hurt right now by Google because Google is sucking
[00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:14.600]   all the air out of Silicon Valley.
[00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:16.320]   One of the issues...
[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:21.040]   You know, we've talked a lot about Apple's decision to put out the iPhone and delay leopard
[00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:23.840]   and you know, I said, "Well, don't they have enough talent?"
[00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:25.800]   Well, apparently they don't.
[00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:30.360]   Apple's response to that is there's only so many Bill Atkinson's in the world.
[00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:31.840]   There's only so many Tiger Woods.
[00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:32.840]   You can't...
[00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:39.840]   The superstar programmers are few and far between and Google is sucking them up.
[00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:44.840]   And they do have a bus that just sort of seems to troll around downtown San Francisco and
[00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:47.560]   the guy sticks a sign in the window and says, "Can you program?"
[00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:48.560]   Yeah.
[00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:49.560]   Well, if you were...
[00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:50.560]   No, really.
[00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:52.720]   I'm not going to include you, Scott, because we know where you'd go.
[00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:57.440]   But for the rest of you, if you were a hot shot programmer just out of school and you
[00:42:57.440 --> 00:43:02.000]   were being wooed by Google and wooed by Apple, wouldn't you go to Google?
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   Why?
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   It depends.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   I mean, one thing...
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   People do both...
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:09.360]   Their stock price is so high that I think a lot of...
[00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:14.040]   I don't know a lot about this stuff, but I'm guessing that for a lot of people, it's...
[00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:16.560]   You got to wonder, can that keep going up and up and up?
[00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:19.360]   I also think that there's a personality thing.
[00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:20.360]   I've been to both campuses.
[00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:21.360]   It's a great campus.
[00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:23.400]   You got to love the Google campus.
[00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:24.400]   The Google campus is great.
[00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:25.400]   Apple campus is great.
[00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:30.160]   The Google campus, though, there's a big difference in the kind of people that work at both companies.
[00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:31.760]   It really seems to be...
[00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:32.760]   Because Apple is very...
[00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:34.760]   It wraps around one person.
[00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:36.280]   And it really is...
[00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:38.280]   Everyone's thinking about what would Steve do in this situation.
[00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:40.280]   Yeah, you don't see the same thing with Larry and Sergey.
[00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:41.880]   They don't go, "What would Larry do?"
[00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:42.880]   Right, exactly.
[00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:45.200]   And they actually encourage a lot of people to be very independent.
[00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:47.160]   So it's a different kind of programmer.
[00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:51.520]   And to be honest with you, a lot of the really good kind of high energy programmers like
[00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:57.720]   to be in that situation where they get to do extra things in their own pieces and they
[00:43:57.720 --> 00:43:59.000]   get to make their own cappuccino machine.
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:00.800]   They have their own cappuccino machine.
[00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:02.960]   Like, oh, they have like 10 of them in one little area.
[00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:06.600]   And then they have really good lunches that you don't have to pay for.
[00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:08.520]   People like to be managed in different ways.
[00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:09.840]   I know this for a fact.
[00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:16.680]   And there are some people who believe it or not do gravitate to sort of like the Darth
[00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:19.480]   Vader boss, like Steve Jobs.
[00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:22.440]   And look at the numbers that came out today.
[00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:26.840]   I mean, Apple sold almost a million max in the quarter.
[00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:29.000]   They had a huge bump over the last quarter.
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.520]   They are seen as a cool company.
[00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:33.840]   They're going to continue to attract talent and the kind of talent that wants to work
[00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:34.840]   in that environment.
[00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:36.640]   Whereas there are people who are more laid back.
[00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:38.160]   They're going to prefer Google.
[00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:40.880]   And then, Microsoft can be bad at everything at once.
[00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:44.800]   It's cash on hand in the bank is so great that it can live off of the interest for 100
[00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:45.800]   years.
[00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:49.080]   But who wants to live with Redmond and who wants to go up there and work for the evil
[00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:50.080]   Empire?
[00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:52.640]   I think Microsoft is the one that's in deepest trouble when this company comes.
[00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:54.120]   That's what I was about to say.
[00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:59.760]   They would be in a lot of trouble except for the fact that they literally own the US Mint.
[00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:00.760]   But they're coasting.
[00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:02.840]   They're coasting on their dominance with Windows.
[00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:04.360]   They're coasting on.
[00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:09.360]   But there's a lot of things also.
[00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:14.280]   There's a lot of stuff that we hear about in the main part of what Microsoft's doing.
[00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:17.800]   There's a lot of these little groups within Microsoft that pretty much have almost complete
[00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:18.800]   autonomy.
[00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:22.600]   And they're working on the HD photo group.
[00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:29.320]   We had Bill Crow on this week in media a couple of weeks ago or a couple of months ago.
[00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:32.240]   They just work on their own stuff and they get no input from anyone else.
[00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:34.560]   They're just fiddling around a little bit.
[00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:37.240]   Mostly they're just playing with their photos synth guys.
[00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:39.680]   They're just sitting there playing with all of this stuff.
[00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:42.520]   And for them it's a great experience.
[00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:45.880]   They get to just be passionate about what they're doing.
[00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:52.080]   I think there are chunks of things that attract people to Microsoft to do that kind of stuff.
[00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:54.240]   And I think that it really is, I think you're right.
[00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:57.680]   I think there's definitely what Scott was talking about, a different feel because the
[00:45:57.680 --> 00:46:01.160]   people who work at Apple you find that they tend to be quieter.
[00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:03.160]   They tend to be very, very competent at what they do.
[00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:06.360]   They tend to be very controlled about what they do.
[00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:08.120]   And that's the way they like it.
[00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:11.120]   And you definitely don't know if they would even fit in at Google.
[00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:13.880]   In the same way Google, there's a lot of people there that wouldn't.
[00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:17.720]   I'd love to hear from people who are making this choice between Apple and Google and
[00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:20.160]   why they would choose one over the other.
[00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:21.160]   It's very, you're right.
[00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:23.560]   I mean certainly it's going to, I'm not everybody's going to choose Google or everybody's going
[00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:24.560]   to choose Apple.
[00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:29.640]   But I am hearing that Apple's complaining that there's this kind of downhill slope towards
[00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:30.640]   mountain.
[00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:31.640]   And to play as hard as Google is.
[00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:35.280]   I mean Google is just, I mean they just spend an enormous amount of energy because they
[00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:37.760]   just need as many engineers as they can find.
[00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:42.480]   And so it is really, the sucking sound isn't just in Silicon Valley.
[00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:43.480]   It's all over the country.
[00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:44.480]   It's all over the world.
[00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:47.520]   Doesn't Kendra Aromoto work for Google and recruiting?
[00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:48.520]   She does.
[00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:49.520]   Yeah.
[00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:50.520]   We should ask her.
[00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:53.080]   I hear that they're paying out some pretty hefty bonuses.
[00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:54.080]   Oh yeah?
[00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:55.080]   Yeah.
[00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:57.760]   What if they need any podcasts?
[00:46:57.760 --> 00:46:58.760]   Yeah.
[00:46:58.760 --> 00:47:01.920]   Yeah, let's all just sell out and go to work at Google.
[00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:03.000]   I'd work at Google.
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   Free lunch.
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   And in it.
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   And they do your dry cleaning.
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:07.000]   Yeah, good.
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   Free lunch.
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:09.000]   Food's always good.
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   I am.
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:11.000]   And they have doggy daycare.
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:12.360]   I'm just curious of one thing.
[00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:16.240]   I think one thing that's kind of interesting is think about the opportunities for stuff
[00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:20.520]   that maybe aren't as easy for a big Google to go after.
[00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:24.760]   I was talking to a friend of mine lunch today about the power of having like a community
[00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:31.120]   for example, and how having a site that's based around some really ardent users, it's
[00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:33.120]   not something you can create overnight.
[00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:34.120]   Oh, that's true.
[00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:35.120]   And it's something you can't force.
[00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:36.120]   And that's just one example.
[00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:39.880]   But I think it's interesting to think about, you know, I mean, in some ways it seems like
[00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:42.720]   there's such a lack of innovation going on at these big companies.
[00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:45.760]   They're always chasing everybody else like, oh gosh, why didn't we make YouTube first?
[00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:50.120]   Or why didn't we, you know, come up with Yahoo groups first or whatever?
[00:47:50.120 --> 00:47:54.400]   And I just like to think about where are the opportunities right now?
[00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:57.240]   Because I think there's still a lot of room for entrepreneurship out there.
[00:47:57.240 --> 00:47:59.960]   There are a lot of people who have a very entrepreneurial personality and you don't want
[00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:01.880]   to work at Google or Apple.
[00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:06.560]   And I think it's just interesting to see where can they kind of hit them where they
[00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:07.560]   ain't?
[00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:08.560]   Well, that's true.
[00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:09.560]   I've got a web 2.0.
[00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:12.920]   There's more genius going on a web 2.0 than either Google or Apple.
[00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:17.560]   And with Google's buying cycle, you can hit them where they ain't as a small company and
[00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:19.480]   work at Google down the road.
[00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:24.760]   And I wonder if being in a company that big as powerful and as resource heavy as they
[00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:28.520]   are, I wonder if that really is conducive to the kind of entrepreneurial mindset that
[00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:32.400]   you need to create something like a great community site or to create a really rapidly
[00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:34.320]   iterating feature heavy site.
[00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:38.320]   Because you can eat somebody's lunch if you've got three hard work and Ruby programmers.
[00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:39.320]   You know what I mean?
[00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:40.320]   You can move really quickly.
[00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:43.800]   Yeah, at the same time it's hard to hold on because there's the next big thing, the
[00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:45.360]   next big thing, the next big thing.
[00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:47.280]   And the scaling issues of all that stuff.
[00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:49.560]   I don't know, I always think that's kind of interesting to think about.
[00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:53.520]   And there's obviously there's a lot of stuff that Google could just poop out in an afternoon
[00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:56.600]   that could destroy a lot of companies if they chose to probably.
[00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:59.960]   But I think there's still a lot of room for innovation for the world.
[00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:06.080]   I just look at something like, I know I've said this before, but my addiction every morning
[00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:09.920]   when I wake up, the thing that I do that gets my brain going is I play desktop tower
[00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:10.920]   defense.
[00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:13.120]   You're so dumb in that.
[00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:14.120]   Totally addictive.
[00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:15.120]   I'm like halfway.
[00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:17.240]   Just thank God it's not on the iPhone.
[00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:18.800]   That's all you should do is thank God.
[00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:19.800]   Oh my God.
[00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:23.280]   Well, no, no, it got to a point where I really only allowed to play it in the morning, one
[00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:26.080]   game in the morning, one game at night.
[00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:27.080]   And that's it.
[00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:28.080]   I'm not allowed to play anymore.
[00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:31.840]   I just don't allow myself to because otherwise I can literally sit there for four hours.
[00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:35.560]   And the thing is, is this guy, it's one guy working on this little thing, just putting
[00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:36.560]   stuff together.
[00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:38.720]   And he's making a reasonable living and he's doing his thing.
[00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:41.520]   And it just amazes me because there's all these really expensive games and there's all
[00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:42.520]   this other stuff.
[00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:44.720]   And that's my favorite game.
[00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:49.880]   I mean, I love playing this one little game and I get very passionate about that single
[00:49:49.880 --> 00:49:50.880]   thing.
[00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:52.520]   Totally, that's totally an independent success story though.
[00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:53.520]   I mean, unbelievably.
[00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:55.040]   I had an interesting epiphany.
[00:49:55.040 --> 00:50:00.400]   I was walking through the lobby of the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas yesterday.
[00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:05.480]   And I was thinking about how much money goes into casinos and what a big business that
[00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:07.080]   is, which is huge.
[00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:13.840]   And I realized really, whatever you think about it, and it's pretty tautry and cheesy.
[00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:16.520]   But people vote, they vote with their feet, they vote with their dollars.
[00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:21.560]   The reason casinos do well is because casinos give people what they want and they flock
[00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:22.560]   to it.
[00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:27.560]   And I realized that really all you have to do is make something people love and really
[00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:29.040]   want and you'll do fine.
[00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:34.120]   Whether it's a simple little flash app like desktop tower defense or it's a podcast or
[00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:35.120]   it's an iPhone.
[00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:39.680]   I mean, yeah, it helps to have a big corporation behind you if you're in manufacturing or building
[00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:40.760]   a casino.
[00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:43.800]   But there are ways to make things people love very cheaply now.
[00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:48.120]   But you know, the whole notion that just because something's big and successful now,
[00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:52.520]   it's automatically evil is something that I really find hard to grasp.
[00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:54.480]   Everybody I know wants to be rich.
[00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:59.080]   And yet, then once they get rich, everybody says, oh, they're evil and everybody wants
[00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:00.080]   to be successful.
[00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:03.800]   And yet when they find successful companies or people, they question their motives.
[00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:05.400]   I don't understand it at all.
[00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:07.080]   And I don't need to worry about it.
[00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:12.360]   Part of the reason is we've seen so many companies, big companies act very evilly.
[00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:18.960]   Well, yeah, but the thing is that, you know, we got the capitalist system works.
[00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:21.240]   And I use the analogy of Netscape.
[00:51:21.240 --> 00:51:22.680]   You talked about IBM, Leo.
[00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:25.880]   I mean, all these companies we're talking about today, 10 years from now, who knows if
[00:51:25.880 --> 00:51:27.760]   they'll even exist.
[00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:31.000]   There's the Merlin man's out there in the world who are independent and probably going
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:33.760]   to stay that way no matter how much money folks offer them.
[00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:37.240]   There's always going to be somebody doing something innovative somewhere with an opportunity
[00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:42.720]   to be the next guy that starts a big company like Microsoft with the three people sitting
[00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:44.520]   at a table and a diner.
[00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:46.560]   I'm not too worried about it.
[00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:50.400]   I was reading a Jeff Hawkins book on intelligence, which by the way, I highly recommend.
[00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:55.360]   And one of the things he said, he's a guy I found at Palm and then handspring certainly
[00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:57.600]   has some experience with successful companies.
[00:51:57.600 --> 00:52:01.240]   He said, the trick is you've got to figure out what the next thing is and be there at
[00:52:01.240 --> 00:52:02.240]   the right time.
[00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:06.680]   And of course, in his opinion, the next big thing is these hierarchical memories, duplicating
[00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:09.160]   brain function and the new artificial intelligence.
[00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:10.720]   And that's what the book's about.
[00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:11.720]   Highly recommend it.
[00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:12.720]   But I think that that's true.
[00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:14.360]   Anything on intelligence on intelligence?
[00:52:14.360 --> 00:52:16.200]   Oh, you've got to read it if you haven't read it.
[00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:17.200]   That's good.
[00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:18.520]   I mean, kind of working my way through.
[00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:19.520]   It's brilliant.
[00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:22.680]   But anyway, it's like Wayne Gretzky said, I don't want to skate where the puck is.
[00:52:22.680 --> 00:52:24.440]   I want to skate where the puck's going to be.
[00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:26.640]   Wayne Gretzky and Steve Jobs said that.
[00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:27.640]   Yeah.
[00:52:27.640 --> 00:52:28.800]   Well, I look at podcasting.
[00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:31.200]   I feel like that's kind of what's going on with podcasting.
[00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:37.320]   I think that there are plenty of opportunities for small companies to suddenly be the next
[00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:38.320]   big thing.
[00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:43.360]   That's another great example of exactly what I was talking about, though, which is that
[00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:45.080]   Google could decide tomorrow.
[00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:46.560]   And I'm not trying to bag on Google.
[00:52:46.560 --> 00:52:50.760]   I love Google, but they could decide tomorrow, OK, well, we're going to totally destroy this
[00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:51.760]   podcasting space.
[00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:52.760]   And what are they going to do?
[00:52:52.760 --> 00:52:55.760]   They're going to create some kind of robot that engineers are going to make.
[00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:56.760]   You're right.
[00:52:56.760 --> 00:52:57.760]   Yeah, they can.
[00:52:57.760 --> 00:53:02.000]   The biggest factor in all this stuff is talent, interest, and community.
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:04.920]   But it's so interesting to me, though, that no matter how big your company gets with a
[00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:09.320]   lot of this stuff, I'm sure if you own a huge piece of the software space, you can force
[00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:10.800]   something down people's throats.
[00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:11.880]   But you're right.
[00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:13.480]   People are discerning.
[00:53:13.480 --> 00:53:17.480]   And they put a lot of their own identity in the decisions that they make about this stuff.
[00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:22.800]   And so that's just another one of these areas, though, where it's really up to the people
[00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:26.120]   to decide whether that's going to be something that they're interested in.
[00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:30.760]   That's what Web2.0 is all about, is that voting with their feet that people are doing.
[00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:33.800]   Do you think there was a time when Microsoft was doing what you described?
[00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:37.960]   Do you think there was a time when people were like, "Yes, Microsoft"?
[00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:38.960]   Absolutely.
[00:53:38.960 --> 00:53:39.960]   And that was for Word.
[00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:40.960]   Word and Windows.
[00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:41.960]   Don't forget.
[00:53:41.960 --> 00:53:42.960]   Windows 3?
[00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:43.960]   Yeah.
[00:53:43.960 --> 00:53:49.080]   I mean, Macintosh was out there, and a small portion of the audience got gooies and got menus
[00:53:49.080 --> 00:53:53.240]   and got mice in '84 when Apple did it.
[00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:58.760]   But it wasn't until the late '80s, the early '90s, when Microsoft put these same technologies
[00:53:58.760 --> 00:54:01.960]   into PCs in the business that they took off.
[00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:08.200]   And I tell you, with Windows 3.0, 3.1, '95, in particular, people loved Microsoft.
[00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:11.600]   I think there are a lot of people still love Microsoft, kind of based on the success in
[00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:12.600]   those days.
[00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:13.600]   Yeah.
[00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:16.040]   And don't forget the brown zoom.
[00:54:16.040 --> 00:54:17.040]   We're trying to forget that.
[00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:18.040]   Talk about a segue.
[00:54:18.040 --> 00:54:20.800]   Did you see the iPhone case?
[00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:23.080]   It makes it look like a zoom?
[00:54:23.080 --> 00:54:24.080]   Yeah.
[00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:25.080]   I want it.
[00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:26.360]   Where do you get it?
[00:54:26.360 --> 00:54:28.240]   It's an anti-theft case.
[00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:32.120]   The new iPhone, any theft device.
[00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:33.520]   So who makes that?
[00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:35.840]   Let's go to hideapod.com.
[00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:36.840]   One word.
[00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:37.840]   That's brilliant.
[00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:38.840]   You love your iPod.
[00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:39.840]   It's a great product.
[00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:42.920]   You take it everywhere and you use it every day, but owning a device so desirable and fashionable
[00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:44.720]   as an iPod comes with one major drawback.
[00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:48.000]   It goes in a zoom case.
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:49.000]   That's brilliant.
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:50.760]   And is this a joke?
[00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:51.760]   I don't know.
[00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:53.760]   I think $29.95.
[00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:55.760]   I'm going to buy one.
[00:54:55.760 --> 00:54:57.880]   It's a joke that might make a lot of money.
[00:54:57.880 --> 00:54:58.880]   Holy cow.
[00:54:58.880 --> 00:54:59.880]   Poor zoom.
[00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:02.160]   That is the funniest thing.
[00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:03.840]   Talk about an indictment.
[00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:06.160]   I'm clicking buy now as we speak.
[00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:08.760]   Oh, we'll know how well it fits soon.
[00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:12.360]   I would love to know how the iPhone one works.
[00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:14.360]   Pop your iPhone inside for an interpretation.
[00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:15.360]   It's got to be a joke.
[00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:17.280]   It's a joke by now and it's giving me a bunch of...
[00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:18.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:55:18.280 --> 00:55:21.160]   You see it has an optional squirt module.
[00:55:21.160 --> 00:55:23.920]   So the zoom can wirelessly squirt, tunes to other zoons.
[00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:28.440]   It's not like there are any other zoom users to share songs with anyway, but we still
[00:55:28.440 --> 00:55:31.640]   don't want iPod owners to be left out or intimidated.
[00:55:31.640 --> 00:55:33.920]   That's why we develop the optional squirt feature.
[00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:39.800]   Simply slide the squirt module into your hide-up pod, then fill the small tank with liquid.
[00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:42.240]   Now you're ready for hours of wireless fun.
[00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:45.960]   Press and hold the zoon's play button and squirt away.
[00:55:45.960 --> 00:55:46.960]   Take that, you iPodators.
[00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:50.000]   Yeah, it's a joke, but you can get a T-shirt.
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:51.760]   I would definitely buy it if you could buy it.
[00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:55.400]   You could buy the T-shirt, Cafe Press, Hide-a-Pod.
[00:55:55.400 --> 00:55:56.960]   I love it.
[00:55:56.960 --> 00:56:00.120]   That's one of your best ever finds on this show, Merlin.
[00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:04.520]   Well, it's like the number two Apple Link on Dig, so I think a lot of folks have seen
[00:56:04.520 --> 00:56:06.600]   it, but it's worth mentioning.
[00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:10.360]   I know you guys, you joined me in my sadness about the state of the zoom.
[00:56:10.360 --> 00:56:14.240]   How do you guys come down on the Mac Heist thing?
[00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:16.360]   There's both pros and cons on this.
[00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:19.440]   There's a Mac Heist going on right now that's kind of amazing.
[00:56:19.440 --> 00:56:23.040]   You get the attention to it after a minute.
[00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:25.800]   Well, the idea, and by the way, there's one day left.
[00:56:25.800 --> 00:56:30.880]   So if you're hearing this on the 18th, you have till midnight on the 19th to get this
[00:56:30.880 --> 00:56:32.720]   thing.
[00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:34.080]   They've sold 10,000 bundles.
[00:56:34.080 --> 00:56:35.840]   Do you remember this when they did this before?
[00:56:35.840 --> 00:56:36.840]   I do, I do.
[00:56:36.840 --> 00:56:38.240]   And there was criticism.
[00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:43.400]   I think John Gruber, among others, critical of the idea that the share where authors are
[00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:46.960]   getting so little and these guys are making so much money, yet they're apparently not
[00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:51.400]   having difficulty getting share where authors to participate.
[00:56:51.400 --> 00:56:55.640]   The new bundles, 50 bucks, you get 15 apps, including TechTool Pro, Little Snitch.
[00:56:55.640 --> 00:57:01.160]   I mean, a lot of stuff that you would want, Fetch, which is not the best anymore, but
[00:57:01.160 --> 00:57:05.000]   still it's 50 bucks for all of that stuff.
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:07.800]   I mean, I guess I'm giving them a plug here.
[00:57:07.800 --> 00:57:12.160]   I don't know how, I mean, hey, if the share where authors go for it, what's wrong with
[00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:13.160]   that?
[00:57:13.160 --> 00:57:16.600]   I think I'd want to negotiate a percentage if I were going to do that.
[00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:21.800]   Apparently, that was part of the complaint is that you couldn't, they was kind of a take
[00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:24.480]   it or leave it flat amount.
[00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:31.640]   I'll just say, I don't want to get too involved, but I will just say that I love Little Snitch.
[00:57:31.640 --> 00:57:32.640]   And you get cocktail?
[00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:33.640]   Well, listen to what you get.
[00:57:33.640 --> 00:57:35.280]   Cocktail's pretty good, yeah.
[00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:36.280]   Yeah.
[00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:42.680]   Garage sale, Cocktail, Procast, Madea's Pro, which is by itself 40 bucks, you get Fetch.
[00:57:42.680 --> 00:57:44.280]   That's what I use for podcast.
[00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:47.080]   Graphic converter, you get Little Snitch, which is also great.
[00:57:47.080 --> 00:57:49.920]   I mean, these are a lot of things we've recommended.
[00:57:49.920 --> 00:57:54.600]   Right room, browse back, which is kind of handy.
[00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:55.600]   This is all 50 bucks.
[00:57:55.600 --> 00:58:00.440]   I mean, if it's legit, it sounds like a heck of a deal because those are a lot of the programs
[00:58:00.440 --> 00:58:01.440]   that we all use.
[00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:03.040]   Yeah, we've recommended a lot of these.
[00:58:03.040 --> 00:58:07.080]   Now, there's no way tech to, you'll get a full tech to, that's kind of the issue is
[00:58:07.080 --> 00:58:08.080]   do you get?
[00:58:08.080 --> 00:58:10.400]   See, that's what I want to know right there.
[00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:13.840]   No, I don't think there's, I think that part of it isn't that suspicious.
[00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:17.520]   You get, like, I think, I think generally, well, I think part of the thing was there were
[00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:21.600]   several things that were a little dicey to some people last time.
[00:58:21.600 --> 00:58:22.920]   You know, there was like.
[00:58:22.920 --> 00:58:24.240]   Well, here's the deal on tech tool.
[00:58:24.240 --> 00:58:27.080]   It will be unlocked for all customers once-
[00:58:27.080 --> 00:58:28.080]   When you get certain number-
[00:58:28.080 --> 00:58:32.400]   5,999 bundles have been sold, but I think they've sold more than that.
[00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:33.400]   Yeah.
[00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:37.640]   See, the whole thing's just, you know, it makes me feel like, you know, a guy trying to sell
[00:58:37.640 --> 00:58:44.120]   me a used car who's wearing a white belt and plastic shoes.
[00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:47.320]   Well, you know, I think, let me just see what, again, what the number is.
[00:58:47.320 --> 00:58:51.880]   I think, oh, I see they have a little bar on here with the unlocking things.
[00:58:51.880 --> 00:58:55.840]   Yeah, they've got, they've got, they've got, they've sold, they're all unlocked now because
[00:58:55.840 --> 00:58:56.840]   they've sold 10,000.
[00:58:56.840 --> 00:58:59.320]   I think the thing to do is wait.
[00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:01.480]   You get a flow beta.
[00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:02.480]   That's pretty cool.
[00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:03.480]   Flow's cool.
[00:59:03.480 --> 00:59:05.480]   We've talked about that, right?
[00:59:05.480 --> 00:59:08.520]   Pixel-amator, pixel-mator, beta?
[00:59:08.520 --> 00:59:11.480]   This makes me wonder if it isn't one of these things like when you went to the fair as a
[00:59:11.480 --> 00:59:15.400]   kid and they talked about the two-headed man inside the tent for only four years.
[00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:17.360]   It's like, I know, I'm always suspicious.
[00:59:17.360 --> 00:59:18.360]   I'm going to do it-
[00:59:18.360 --> 00:59:19.360]   It's got, come over to my house.
[00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:20.360]   I'll show you the two-headed man.
[00:59:20.360 --> 00:59:21.360]   I'm going to do it.
[00:59:21.360 --> 00:59:22.360]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:59:22.360 --> 00:59:23.880]   I'll do it right now and I'll report back to you.
[00:59:23.880 --> 00:59:25.880]   It's 50 bucks.
[00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:29.520]   I mean, I've paid for a lot of this already, but there's enough still that-
[00:59:29.520 --> 00:59:30.520]   It's done.
[00:59:30.520 --> 00:59:31.520]   Well, let us know.
[00:59:31.520 --> 00:59:32.520]   Let us know, Leo.
[00:59:32.520 --> 00:59:36.160]   Next week, we'll get a report from Leo and we'll-
[00:59:36.160 --> 00:59:37.160]   Yeah.
[00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:38.160]   Yeah.
[00:59:38.160 --> 00:59:39.160]   Here's an interesting story.
[00:59:39.160 --> 00:59:40.160]   We should have bought it.
[00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:41.160]   Here's an interesting story.
[00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:43.320]   Speaking of screwed from Duke University, they say-
[00:59:43.320 --> 00:59:44.320]   [laughter]
[00:59:44.320 --> 00:59:45.320]   Did you see this?
[00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:49.240]   There are 150 iPhones registered on the campus network.
[00:59:49.240 --> 00:59:55.320]   And it's bringing the Duke Wi-Fi down, baby.
[00:59:55.320 --> 00:59:56.720]   Something about the iPhone.
[00:59:56.720 --> 01:00:03.400]   Well, the Professor of Computer Science, Ashok Agrawala, says or speculates that it's
[01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:06.480]   something to do with Duke's network as well as the iPhone.
[01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:13.800]   He says he thinks the phones could be struggling to regain the Wi-Fi connection during handoffs,
[01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:17.160]   and that's sending a lot of traffic.
[01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:18.800]   They haven't figured this out.
[01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:23.840]   A dis spokesman at Duke said an analysis of traffic found that iPhones flooded parts
[01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:27.920]   of the campus wireless network with access requests freezing parts of the system for
[01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:29.760]   ten minutes at a time.
[01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:33.600]   But there's only 100 to 150 iPhones.
[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:38.320]   Well there were 300 and some odd iPhones at Adobe's headquarters during the iPhone Dev
[01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:40.280]   Camp, and they were able to handle the load.
[01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:41.280]   Yeah, I'm wondering.
[01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:43.400]   There's some configuration issue at Duke.
[01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:44.680]   Yeah, some specific sum over there.
[01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:46.680]   Have you seen this?
[01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:50.160]   Apple's granted the patent for user portability.
[01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:51.160]   What's that?
[01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:56.440]   You're going to take a user and be able to transport them portably.
[01:00:56.440 --> 01:00:57.440]   Through the iPhone.
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:58.440]   Yeah.
[01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:02.440]   So you point that little camera at yourself and it looks like Star Trek and then you're
[01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:03.440]   what?
[01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:05.320]   What are you talking here?
[01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:06.520]   I don't get it.
[01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:14.560]   So Apple has, they apply for a patent that basically allows a multi-user, both patents
[01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:19.160]   discuss a method of creating an account for a multi-user computer and storing the account
[01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:23.960]   information as well as home directory and some of the other, on some type of external
[01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:27.240]   device such as a USB drive or an iPod.
[01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:33.240]   OSX would then be modified to search removable storage for user accounts allowing you to
[01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:37.160]   take your storage device to any computer login and have all your data right there.
[01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:39.680]   So it's just a matter of refining that idea.
[01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:43.560]   A lot of us have played with this idea of moving your user account to your hard drive.
[01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:45.000]   So I've tried it.
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:46.000]   It's cumbersome.
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.360]   Oh, I get what you're talking about.
[01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:52.680]   So you set up your user account on, like I'll install a startup for instance, completely
[01:01:52.680 --> 01:02:00.760]   on my hard drive that I can just log in to any computer, restart it and set that's your,
[01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:02.280]   you know, that's my startup drive.
[01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:04.680]   But it's really cumbersome.
[01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:08.320]   And so the idea is that the computer, when you restarted any computer you had, it would
[01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:09.760]   look for an external user.
[01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:14.920]   So if I plug my iPhone into my computer, it's going to look for the user account, not the
[01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:19.120]   services and everything else, but just the user account, it'll look for it on my iPhone.
[01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:24.640]   So I could carry everything around with me and simply lock it in and be myself in whatever
[01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:25.640]   Mac I'm at.
[01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:27.880]   That'd be so awesome.
[01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:28.880]   Wow.
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:33.440]   And would you carry all your data on a USB key or something or?
[01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:39.480]   I think the idea, the idea, it wouldn't really work as much on the current iPhone, but if
[01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:43.560]   you had like, or, but on a current iPod of 80 gigs or whatever, plenty on there.
[01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:48.560]   It's the size of a lot of our definitely directory is definitely larger than my user account.
[01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:49.560]   Wow.
[01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:53.480]   Well, you know, you could, I mean, you've been able to do that for a long time with the,
[01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:58.120]   I don't know what they call it, but the apples had that feature for a long time at OS 10,
[01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:02.960]   maybe even before then on school networks, you log into any machine and you get your
[01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:04.120]   home directory.
[01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:05.120]   Right.
[01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:06.720]   So this is just a, I wouldn't build an app.
[01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:07.720]   I thought I was excited.
[01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:10.680]   So they want to give away the patent to this so others could do it?
[01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:13.920]   No, I think that they, the patent just got approved.
[01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:19.000]   Ah, so the, I think that the idea is that you'll be able to do it with your Mac and probably
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.000]   not much else.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:20.960]   Oh, so they,
[01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:21.960]   Oh, so they,
[01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:24.440]   I think to not improve dot Mac, well, things.
[01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:27.320]   Yeah, don't Mac should do this.
[01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:28.320]   Geez.
[01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:32.480]   I'm telling you, man, I, I, they, they're leaving so much opportunity on the table.
[01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:33.920]   Why not making dot Mac better?
[01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:35.480]   It's just, I don't know.
[01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:38.520]   I think they're working on it.
[01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:39.520]   Yeah.
[01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:42.600]   I think, I think we'll see some improvements soon.
[01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:46.640]   And if we don't, I can't imagine why people want to continue to support it.
[01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:50.200]   Suckers like me are going to have to because if you got, I just don't know of a way.
[01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:54.320]   There's all these ways that where you can like with, you know, with spit and bailing
[01:03:54.320 --> 01:04:00.200]   wire, you can like emulate the dot Mac, but it's, it's really the simplest way I know
[01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:02.920]   of to keep four computers synced up.
[01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:04.640]   It's, it's just easy.
[01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:07.360]   And you know, that, that, that to me is very worthwhile.
[01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:12.160]   And I'm fortunate enough to be in a position where I can afford to pay that, you know,
[01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:15.600]   amount of money, but it would be nice if they would add some other stuff to it.
[01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:18.880]   And I guess that I keep coming back to this on like a quarterly basis here on the show.
[01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:22.400]   But to me, they're missing a huge opportunity to make turn this into like your personal
[01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:27.320]   lifestyle hub, you know, throw, man, throw 50 gigs of people turn into something where
[01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:30.320]   you can like take your MP3s with you legally.
[01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:31.320]   You know what I mean?
[01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:34.080]   I mean, that just seems like this could be the place that keeps you coming back to
[01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:38.120]   Mac's website all the time, because that in iTunes is where you do all your stuff.
[01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:39.120]   Right.
[01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:40.680]   It may go season, okay.
[01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:43.680]   Have we, have we, do we think that we're actually going to see an IMac next next, next
[01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:46.920]   the next couple weeks?
[01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:48.400]   We've been hearing that for a couple of months.
[01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:52.080]   I got an email from somebody saying, could you please buy an IMac?
[01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:54.720]   Because everybody's just waiting.
[01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:57.240]   And as soon as you buy that, they'll get the new IMac out.
[01:04:57.240 --> 01:04:59.160]   Was there a recent, was there a recent cursive Leo?
[01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:01.920]   I saw something in an immediate, what's your latest one?
[01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:02.920]   Oh, what was it?
[01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:04.920]   It was something I just bought.
[01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:06.680]   Oh, go ahead.
[01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:09.960]   Oh, I bought a Canon 5D.
[01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:10.960]   The camera, that's right.
[01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:12.400]   It's been a lot of money on it.
[01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:14.880]   And they announced the Mark II literally the next day.
[01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:17.800]   The Mark III, whatever.
[01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:18.800]   The next one.
[01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:19.800]   Now it's not out yet.
[01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:20.800]   It's not buying.
[01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:22.360]   But I think they were, it's pretty clear.
[01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:26.080]   Canon was waiting and watching because they did it that very next day.
[01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:27.240]   It was like they said, at least.
[01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:29.200]   That's unkind.
[01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:31.040]   You know, I thought it was a joke.
[01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:32.320]   I didn't believe it when people said it.
[01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:33.760]   I thought, oh, ha, ha, go along with it.
[01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:35.080]   But now I'm starting to think it's really--
[01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:36.720]   You know, Leo, because here's the deal.
[01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:38.360]   You need-- well, we probably shouldn't talk about this on air.
[01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:40.600]   But you should do some kind of tracer bullet.
[01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:45.240]   You should know, hey, I just bought the new blah, blah, blah, whatever.
[01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:47.800]   Some really incredibly costly thing, like maybe a Prius.
[01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:49.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:51.120]   And you just bought this thing.
[01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:54.120]   You pay the sticker price on it that it's cool because you're really excited.
[01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:58.280]   And then we'll see what happens.
[01:05:58.280 --> 01:06:00.280]   Are they just listening?
[01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:02.040]   Is it something where you've got some kind of--
[01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:03.920]   Oh, it's karma.
[01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:04.440]   Yeah.
[01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:05.440]   It's karma.
[01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:06.640]   You've got some kind of consumer stink on you.
[01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:08.680]   It's just that you do the problem.
[01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:10.000]   And people pick up on it.
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:11.920]   It's like they smell it like fear.
[01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:12.920]   Ah!
[01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:14.640]   It's snowing from months away.
[01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:15.480]   Ah.
[01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:17.600]   Well, it's not like I'm not happy I bought the 5D.
[01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:19.720]   But I did notice it had been out for a couple of years.
[01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:22.480]   And I should have thought a little harder before I bought it.
[01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:24.360]   It's a fine camera, Leo.
[01:06:24.360 --> 01:06:25.200]   It's a funny camera.
[01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:27.000]   Can I do a little mini-rat hole here?
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:31.920]   Do you guys have a site that you love for going and comparing--
[01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:34.720]   not just prices, but models on electronics?
[01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:37.200]   I've been thinking about getting my DVD player broke.
[01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:39.720]   And I've been thinking about getting an HD or Blu-ray.
[01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:41.200]   And I have no idea where to begin.
[01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:42.880]   And I wouldn't even know what site now it is.
[01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:44.040]   I usually just go to Amazon.
[01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:45.400]   I read the reviews.
[01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:46.720]   Amazon carries most everything.
[01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:48.680]   They usually have aggressive pricing.
[01:06:48.680 --> 01:06:52.680]   And then you could go somewhere like Next Tag or Price Watch.
[01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:53.200]   Next Tag.
[01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:53.680]   I go to--
[01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:54.600]   You do a lot of stuff like that.
[01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:55.120]   Don't you, Alex?
[01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:56.360]   Aren't you a big comparison shopper?
[01:06:56.360 --> 01:06:57.680]   I ask Robert Pickering.
[01:06:57.680 --> 01:06:58.680]   Ah!
[01:06:58.680 --> 01:06:59.180]   Ah!
[01:06:59.180 --> 01:07:00.160]   No, that's just for HD.
[01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:01.040]   No, I'm not kidding.
[01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:02.360]   I ask Robert here.
[01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:02.880]   I'll tell you.
[01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:05.600]   I just came back from the Electronic Media Association
[01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:08.560]   confab in Las Vegas.
[01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:10.160]   I was just there yesterday.
[01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:13.000]   That's the old VSDA video software dealers.
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:17.360]   It's where all the people who sell videos--
[01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:20.040]   blockbuster Netflix, everybody.
[01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:22.920]   And they're really trying to push this HD thing.
[01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:27.480]   In fact, don't be jealous, but they were selling HD DVD players
[01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:30.680]   Toshiba to everybody who was at the conference
[01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:34.960]   got an HD DVD player for 100 bucks, plus three movies.
[01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:39.440]   However, the good news is both HD DVD and Blu-ray
[01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:40.560]   are dropping in prices.
[01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:45.240]   Now there is a Sony Blu-ray player for 500, which is good.
[01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:46.480]   That's the best Blu-ray player.
[01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:49.560]   And HD DVD, everybody expects by Christmas
[01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:51.680]   will drop to a couple of hundred bucks.
[01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:54.200]   And if you're looking for deals, Merlin,
[01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:56.000]   I go to dealnews.com.
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:56.800]   Dealnews is great.
[01:07:56.800 --> 01:07:58.040]   Dealnews is great.
[01:07:58.040 --> 01:08:00.560]   They're great for stuff like blank media.
[01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:03.200]   And I love the blog-like nature of dealnews.
[01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:05.040]   It's like the best place.
[01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:08.040]   And they have individual sites like DealRam,
[01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:09.840]   which is a really good place to get RAM.
[01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:10.560]   So they're still--
[01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:12.360]   I get to deal Mac a lot.
[01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:12.840]   They're still good.
[01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:14.360]   I used to get their mailers.
[01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:15.280]   You get an email.
[01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:17.320]   And every day with great Mac prices,
[01:08:17.320 --> 01:08:18.200]   you know why I stopped, though?
[01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:19.600]   I kept buying stuff.
[01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:21.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:23.920]   I mean, seriously, it was ended up being very costly email
[01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:26.760]   to get, because I go, oh, that's the best price I've seen.
[01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:27.800]   That's a good one.
[01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:28.240]   It's a very--
[01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:30.000]   You didn't stop to consider whether you needed it.
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.480]   You just knew it was the best price you'd seen.
[01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:34.200]   That's pretty much it.
[01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:34.960]   Pretty much it.
[01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:36.680]   So anyway, I think--
[01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:39.480]   OK, thank goodness there's no dealfood.com,
[01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:41.040]   or else I'd be in trouble.
[01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:42.080]   I'll eat that.
[01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:43.160]   Deal beef.
[01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:43.840]   I'll eat that.
[01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:44.360]   That's right.
[01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:46.720]   My personalized deal beef thread.
[01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:49.240]   When are we going to go back to the Zeppelin place?
[01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:51.160]   Oh, we got to do another house of products.
[01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:51.880]   Oh, that was--
[01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:54.040]   Leo, I guess you recommended the Zeppelin to someone
[01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:55.360]   at the DMT.
[01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:57.440]   Well, actually, a friend of mine that's Andy Sullivan, who
[01:08:57.440 --> 01:08:59.600]   was staying here in Philadelphia with him,
[01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:01.560]   he said they all went to the Zeppelin room,
[01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:04.640]   and they had to crawl out.
[01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:06.560]   How's the prime rib, baby?
[01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:08.360]   How's the prime rib, oh, my goodness.
[01:09:08.360 --> 01:09:10.800]   We need another confab there, another get together
[01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:11.720]   of the bunch of us.
[01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:14.160]   But no one-- I mean, Merlin--
[01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:14.560]   Yeah.
[01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:15.760]   Unbelievable.
[01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:17.240]   He's the only one that got second.
[01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:17.760]   Second.
[01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:20.080]   I have no regard for my own health.
[01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:21.320]   And seconds.
[01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:23.160]   He's the smallest person in the group,
[01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:24.800]   and he's the only one to have gotten second.
[01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:25.880]   But here's a tip.
[01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:29.920]   Don't get the king cut like Scott and I did,
[01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:31.520]   because if you get the prince cut,
[01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:34.000]   you just go back for seconds, and you get just as much meat.
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.800]   That's a modest-- it's a very modest seconds they give you.
[01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:38.800]   It's probably like number three or four ounces.
[01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:39.800]   It's more like--
[01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:40.120]   Yeah.
[01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:41.520]   And you kick it thirds.
[01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:44.200]   You can't keep going.
[01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:45.240]   I've never tried.
[01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:46.400]   I've never tried.
[01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:47.600]   You know, no one ever has.
[01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:49.520]   In 50 years of operation, no one's yet
[01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:51.800]   gone back for thirds at House of Prime Rib.
[01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:53.960]   And if we bring Durban, let's let him know that he's going
[01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:55.960]   to eat like a man.
[01:09:55.960 --> 01:09:57.120]   But he got fish.
[01:09:57.120 --> 01:09:59.040]   I mean, that's just not right.
[01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:00.240]   What are you ordering?
[01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:02.800]   Chicken fish?
[01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:04.360]   I didn't even know we carried fish, sir.
[01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:05.560]   You were very funny, Marilyn.
[01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:06.560]   I have to put the order in for you.
[01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:07.160]   You were very funny.
[01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:08.680]   He said, would you like some tampax with your fish?
[01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:10.680]   Yeah, that was my favorite line of the deal.
[01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:11.640]   Very funny.
[01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:12.680]   And I'm just shocked every one.
[01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:16.080]   You left your skirt in order since steak.
[01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:16.920]   That's all right.
[01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:19.560]   This is a manly podcast.
[01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:20.560]   Full of manly men.
[01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:22.440]   Well, the place has that kind of feel to it.
[01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:23.920]   It's got that kind of, you know--
[01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:24.800]   You know what, though?
[01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:28.320]   There are few things more attractive than a slender young
[01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:32.960]   woman who eats a big piece of meat.
[01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:33.440]   Yeah.
[01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:34.680]   What do you think?
[01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:35.200]   It's true.
[01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:37.840]   I really admire what the girl does to me.
[01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:42.280]   I'm like a little bit like a much unapologetically devour.
[01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:42.920]   Devours it.
[01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:44.960]   And then afterwards, lights up a lucky.
[01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:46.560]   I think it's totally hot.
[01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:47.840]   That's my kind of woman.
[01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:50.880]   Drinks in Martini, two or three, has a big piece of meat,
[01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:52.080]   then lights up a lucky.
[01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:54.640]   That is a woman.
[01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:56.800]   OK, what's next?
[01:10:56.800 --> 01:10:58.480]   I'm so sorry.
[01:10:58.480 --> 01:10:59.760]   I don't know what's going on.
[01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:00.760]   I've been trying to buy--
[01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:02.640]   I think I've paid for this Mac heist thing
[01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:04.920]   like five or six times now.
[01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:05.200]   It keeps--
[01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:06.840]   Yeah, you had to pay $250.
[01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:07.400]   I think so.
[01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:09.200]   I keep saying can't find a matching receipt
[01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:10.080]   among your records.
[01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:11.080]   I don't know what that means.
[01:11:11.080 --> 01:11:13.560]   And I keep going pay, pay, pay, pay, pay.
[01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:15.480]   I've paid four times now.
[01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:18.120]   So I hope I don't get a bill for $400.
[01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:19.720]   But I have received a receipt already.
[01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:21.320]   My first receipt from Garage Sale.
[01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:22.600]   I don't even know what Garage Sale is.
[01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:23.720]   It sounds like an eBay thing.
[01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:24.600]   That's eBay thing.
[01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:25.320]   It's cool.
[01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:26.040]   Yeah.
[01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:27.360]   From I was coding--
[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:30.400]   I like that Iwascoding.com.
[01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:31.960]   Are you sick and tired of creating options
[01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:33.720]   using eBay's slow website?
[01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:35.640]   Have you been waiting patiently for a quality,
[01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:38.040]   affordable listing utility for the Mac OS?
[01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:39.120]   Here's your deliverance.
[01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:40.080]   Well, I'll try that.
[01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:40.760]   What should I sell?
[01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:41.560]   I know.
[01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:42.880]   My Canon 5D.
[01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:44.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:45.880]   No, how about you?
[01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:46.880]   How about you?
[01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:48.280]   How about your cube, Leo?
[01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:49.520]   Oh, the cube.
[01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:51.400]   My Nike, my Nokia, and 95.
[01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:53.600]   I've got a lot of worthless--
[01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:54.640]   I like my cube.
[01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:55.520]   --technologies.
[01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:56.640]   You kept your cube?
[01:11:56.640 --> 01:11:57.400]   I got the cube.
[01:11:57.400 --> 01:12:00.160]   I gave it to a charity auction.
[01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:02.120]   It's still like a server somewhere in the office.
[01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:03.520]   I think it serves up--
[01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:05.360]   it's like a key server for our--
[01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:06.080]   Oh, that'd be good.
[01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:09.000]   Because that's sufficient to do that.
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:12.560]   You want to serve websites with-- it's only 500 megahertz.
[01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:13.600]   No, it's just like--
[01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:15.080]   it's a couple hundred people checking in going,
[01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:16.280]   can I use this application?
[01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:17.120]   That's all it does.
[01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:18.600]   That's a clever idea.
[01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:19.040]   Oh, I see.
[01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:21.320]   You use that for licenses.
[01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:23.040]   We serve up licenses to the Pixelcore,
[01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:24.920]   because they get all these free software that they change to.
[01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:27.040]   But you can only have so many seats that you're allowed to have.
[01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:28.600]   But we only get like 200 seats or 300 seats.
[01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:29.080]   That's clever.
[01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:30.240]   So we have to keep track of it.
[01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:30.840]   That's very clever.
[01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:32.640]   Did Ben Durban do that too?
[01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:33.760]   Ben Durban did do that because he--
[01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:35.760]   I forgive him the fish.
[01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:38.600]   It's OK to eat fish if you're--
[01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:41.080]   Crazy, crazy intelligent, talented.
[01:12:41.080 --> 01:12:42.080]   A code monkey.
[01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:42.600]   Code monkey.
[01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:43.040]   It's an eat fish.
[01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:44.440]   Superstar.
[01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:47.400]   By the way, I finally listen to your audible recommendation.
[01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:48.800]   In fact, Merlin, get ready because I'm
[01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:50.880]   going to put you on the spot for another audible recommendation.
[01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:55.240]   But I finally listen to John Hodgman, Gary's an expertise.
[01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:57.120]   And you mentioned that Joe Co was on there,
[01:12:57.120 --> 01:12:59.480]   but I didn't know how much Joe Co was part of it.
[01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:00.720]   Yeah, he won't leave.
[01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:01.720]   He's great.
[01:13:01.720 --> 01:13:04.120]   John gives him lots of opportunities to leave.
[01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:05.160]   And you won't leave?
[01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:06.440]   The whole book.
[01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:09.600]   And then on the disk, I think it's 998,
[01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:14.360]   he sings his ode to the furry old lobster.
[01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:16.560]   That's very touching about when the furreled lobsters were still
[01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:17.320]   in Central Park.
[01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:17.960]   That is very touching.
[01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:18.960]   It's moving.
[01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:20.440]   I was in tears on the airplane.
[01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:22.280]   People saw me sobbing.
[01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:24.560]   So I guess that could be our audible book.
[01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:25.480]   But we already recommended it.
[01:13:25.480 --> 01:13:27.840]   In fact, I recommended it a couple of times now.
[01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:28.360]   It might do.
[01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:28.840]   It might do this.
[01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:29.680]   You're due.
[01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:30.600]   Scott did last one.
[01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:32.360]   If you have one, if you know, and I can come up with it,
[01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:33.360]   I've got tons of them.
[01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:34.760]   I have one too.
[01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:36.000]   You have one?
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.440]   Merlin, you want to see to the de-center from--
[01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:38.920]   I've cheated Alex.
[01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:41.040]   If it's available on the site ticket.
[01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:41.840]   How about it?
[01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:46.120]   We will see your-- past your 10 minutes
[01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:48.280]   to the senator named Ben.
[01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:51.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:55.400]   The senator from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Mr. Ben Lindsey.
[01:13:55.400 --> 01:13:56.720]   So let me tell you the inns, guys.
[01:13:56.720 --> 01:13:58.240]   The inns, guys are sitting here.
[01:13:58.240 --> 01:13:59.160]   No, that's kind of a--
[01:13:59.160 --> 01:13:59.880]   How you doing?
[01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:00.880]   Do they say that in Pittsburgh?
[01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:01.960]   How you doing?
[01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:03.360]   No, it's mostly--
[01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:04.440]   Hey, hey.
[01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:06.560]   Hey, how you doing?
[01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:07.960]   Hey, inns, guys going down there?
[01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:08.960]   You next.
[01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:09.960]   So I'm sitting there.
[01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:10.440]   You want peppers?
[01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:12.320]   You want peppers with that, Helgie?
[01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:12.920]   I'm sitting here.
[01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:15.840]   I'm thinking about the pangans.
[01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:17.800]   And I was wondering if Marl, I mean, he's
[01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:20.480]   going to be selling it.
[01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:22.480]   I never really-- so there's-- what you're saying
[01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:24.840]   is they have Canadian accents in Pittsburgh?
[01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:26.960]   Sometimes, sometimes, the get's in there.
[01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:28.160]   We're close to Canada.
[01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:30.200]   We're only four hours away.
[01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:30.800]   So--
[01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:32.760]   Justine was out here over the weekend.
[01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:33.760]   I know.
[01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:34.720]   And I was out here.
[01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:36.040]   She's going to be over this weekend, isn't she?
[01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:39.320]   He's making a Pittsburgh-- Pittsburghians.
[01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:41.160]   All right, what's your book, my friend?
[01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:43.760]   By the way, this podcast brought to you once again
[01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:45.160]   by the good folks at audible.com.
[01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:46.080]   They haven't given up yet.
[01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:47.600]   They're going to keep advertising on Twitter
[01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:49.120]   until somebody signs up.
[01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:49.760]   Could be you.
[01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:56.640]   Audible.com/MacBreak.
[01:14:56.640 --> 01:15:00.760]   So this-- you only get-- and this I have to--
[01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:02.680]   before you go on, I just have to mention one thing.
[01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:04.520]   You only get one credit.
[01:15:04.520 --> 01:15:06.200]   So there are some books we've recommended
[01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:07.400]   that are two credits.
[01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:08.280]   I'm sorry to say.
[01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:09.640]   And I'm asking them for more credits.
[01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:13.160]   But in the meantime, you get one credit when you sign up
[01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:15.360]   audible.com/MacBreak.
[01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:18.640]   If no obligation, if you decide not to stay the member,
[01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:20.120]   just cancel, there'll be no cost to you.
[01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:21.480]   You get to keep the book.
[01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:24.160]   But what is your book for the day?
[01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:25.640]   My book for the day, actually, the one
[01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:26.840]   that I've been working my way through,
[01:15:26.840 --> 01:15:30.360]   is that I downloaded, I guess, through the Audible account
[01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:33.360]   through iTunes, was collapse.
[01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:36.000]   How societies choose to fail or succeed?
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:37.920]   Oh, I've got this.
[01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:40.160]   I've downloaded this, but I haven't listened to it yet.
[01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:41.720]   It is really good.
[01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:45.400]   Same guy who wrote Guns, Germs, and Steel's Jared Diamond.
[01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:46.760]   Yeah, it's fascinating.
[01:15:46.760 --> 01:15:48.560]   It really gets into--
[01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:49.760]   I haven't finished it yet.
[01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:53.360]   But the number one-- I'm not sure who's actually doing the--
[01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:54.360]   I don't think it's him.
[01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:56.000]   I think it's Christopher Murray.
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:57.160]   Christopher Murray's reading it.
[01:15:57.160 --> 01:15:57.600]   Or Murray.
[01:15:57.600 --> 01:15:59.640]   And it's really-- it just sounds great.
[01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:02.360]   It sounds exactly the way it should.
[01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:03.760]   But it's also-- it's easy to listen to.
[01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:06.080]   I throw it in the background while I'm doing whatever I'm doing.
[01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:07.880]   And it's just this-- oh, I have to do it.
[01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:10.080]   Just about cleaning is about all I can do or driving,
[01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:12.920]   because there's so much data about dealing with.
[01:16:12.920 --> 01:16:14.400]   So what's the best?
[01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:18.120]   It's about how societies-- a lot of us
[01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:21.080]   looking at older ancient societies all the way up
[01:16:21.080 --> 01:16:25.880]   to even current societies, but in pockets,
[01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:28.600]   of how they basically grow, but then also
[01:16:28.600 --> 01:16:31.520]   how a lot of times they can fail, largely
[01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:33.480]   out of outstripping the resources.
[01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:36.520]   If you look at-- they were talking about Pitcairn Island
[01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:39.000]   and some of the other islands where we came,
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:40.960]   and there was no one there or the Easter islands where
[01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:42.920]   there was all these huge-- something happened there.
[01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:43.680]   Something was big.
[01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:45.480]   They were moving-- they had these big statues here.
[01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:46.640]   But what happened?
[01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:50.000]   And it talks about how the societies built up,
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.320]   how they used up-- in those cases,
[01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:54.280]   used up certain resources.
[01:16:54.280 --> 01:16:58.280]   And by the end, they were just completely out of resources.
[01:16:58.280 --> 01:17:00.360]   I like the tag, like, how societies
[01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:02.760]   choose to fail or succeed.
[01:17:02.760 --> 01:17:06.240]   So the implication is there's something they do that determines
[01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:07.680]   their success or failure.
[01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:11.280]   So it's-- and I said, I'm only in part one right now.
[01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:14.160]   There's four parts that I download.
[01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:15.240]   Maybe a two credit book.
[01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:16.360]   We'll have to check.
[01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:16.760]   I don't know.
[01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:19.360]   But it's worth it if it is, because it's really--
[01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:21.600]   You know, it just sign up and get the whole darn thing.
[01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:22.800]   It's in my library.
[01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:23.680]   I can't wait.
[01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:25.280]   In fact, it's on my iPhone, believe it or not.
[01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:27.160]   It's really, really, really good.
[01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:30.240]   And I find it fascinating.
[01:17:30.240 --> 01:17:31.600]   That's most of what I mean.
[01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:32.600]   But I tend to be-- you know me.
[01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:34.480]   I read The Economist and--
[01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:37.040]   No, I loved Guns, Germs, and Steel,
[01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:39.400]   because here's a guy who's very, very smart.
[01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:40.240]   It's about history.
[01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:40.960]   It's about culture.
[01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:42.080]   It's anthropology.
[01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:45.880]   But he synthesizes it in unique new ways.
[01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:47.600]   And that's what Guns, Germs, and Steel did.
[01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:49.520]   I mean, I was a history major in college.
[01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:50.600]   I'm fascinated by this stuff.
[01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:52.960]   But he comes up with unique interpretations
[01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:55.840]   that just make a lot of sense and give you a great insight
[01:17:55.840 --> 01:17:57.560]   into why things are the way they are.
[01:17:57.560 --> 01:17:59.480]   I just think that's wonderful.
[01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:00.560]   Highly-- I agree with you.
[01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:01.640]   And I can't wait to read it.
[01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:02.160]   So I'm good.
[01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:04.320]   That's moving up on my list.
[01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:05.320]   I have so many books.
[01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:08.240]   I don't listen to as many as I used to when I commuted.
[01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:10.360]   And I'm wait-- and I have bigger--
[01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:13.320]   my eyes are bigger than my forehead or something,
[01:18:13.320 --> 01:18:16.040]   because I have like 20 books that I haven't read yet.
[01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:18.120]   The iTunes thing gets really dangerous for me,
[01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:20.000]   because when we started talking about the audible thing,
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.040]   I went, oh, see what's on iTunes.
[01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:26.280]   I had like four books, almost immediately.
[01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:27.040]   Get a subscription.
[01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:28.120]   It's much more economical.
[01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:28.960]   I can't remember what it is.
[01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:30.720]   But you pay a monthly fee and you get two books a month
[01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:31.720]   or something like that.
[01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:34.040]   And it's much more economical.
[01:18:34.040 --> 01:18:35.280]   For somebody who reads a lot.
[01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:37.200]   And you do, I think.
[01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:38.520]   I read a lot of magazines.
[01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:41.000]   You know, I got-- and this isn't part of the commercial.
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:41.880]   Actually, none of this is.
[01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:45.400]   The commercial's just coming up when I'm going to say audible.com/mic,
[01:18:45.400 --> 01:18:46.040]   right?
[01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:48.840]   But a number of people sent me an email saying, you know what?
[01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:51.720]   They won't offer Harry Potter.
[01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:53.440]   The Harry Potter books anymore on Audible.
[01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:55.840]   You have to go to iTunes to get them.
[01:18:55.840 --> 01:18:59.520]   And I guess the deal is that the publisher of the Harry Potter
[01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:02.880]   books wanted a lot of money.
[01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:05.120]   Remember, Audible is just like a bookstore.
[01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:06.480]   And they have the same--
[01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:09.200]   they make deals with the publishers.
[01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:10.760]   And they wanted a lot of-- I heard.
[01:19:10.760 --> 01:19:12.880]   And it's not from Audible, and it may be wrong.
[01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:14.040]   I'm gladly corrected.
[01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:17.000]   But that Apple was able to offer them that kind of money
[01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:20.440]   for the exclusivity that Harry Potter exclusive--
[01:19:20.440 --> 01:19:22.080]   it's still from Audible.
[01:19:22.080 --> 01:19:24.640]   But it's only through iTunes.
[01:19:24.640 --> 01:19:25.280]   Interesting.
[01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:26.240]   Yeah, isn't that interesting?
[01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:28.440]   So Apple was able to say, yeah, we'll give you--
[01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:30.200]   Apple, for all we know, said, we'll
[01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:32.360]   give you the full amount of money.
[01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:35.120]   Because Apple knows it's still a locsleader for listening
[01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:36.800]   to Harry Potter on your iPod.
[01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:39.000]   Yeah, they're completely willing to not
[01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.960]   make money on any of the music, because they know it's
[01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:42.720]   selling hardware.
[01:19:42.720 --> 01:19:44.440]   And that's really what they're all about.
[01:19:44.440 --> 01:19:46.560]   So if you can only get it through iTunes,
[01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:47.680]   that's good for Apple.
[01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:49.280]   So I imagine that's what happened.
[01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:51.200]   Audible just couldn't compete.
[01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:52.560]   But plenty of other great books.
[01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:54.840]   I mean, it's a really wonderful bookstore.
[01:19:54.840 --> 01:19:57.400]   If you want to join Audible, highly recommend it, all you
[01:19:57.400 --> 01:20:01.080]   got to do is go to audible.com/makebreak, Macbreak,
[01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:03.440]   and sign up.
[01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:04.400]   And--
[01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:06.120]   But you hear the dogs going crazy?
[01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:06.560]   I do.
[01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:08.040]   I do hear a tiny dog.
[01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:08.880]   There's several of them.
[01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:09.960]   They're not mine.
[01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:11.840]   Seems like there's a dog fight going on.
[01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:12.600]   Wait a minute.
[01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:13.160]   There's not dogs.
[01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:15.480]   There's kids downstairs where I'm recording.
[01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:15.960]   Is that it?
[01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:16.880]   I'm in a house.
[01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:17.800]   Yeah, I hear the kids.
[01:20:17.800 --> 01:20:18.640]   I heard kids earlier.
[01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:22.320]   I thought somebody's got children and is not admitting to it.
[01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:23.640]   No, they're downstairs.
[01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:24.160]   They're my friend.
[01:20:24.160 --> 01:20:25.560]   No, they're not know of.
[01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:26.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:20:26.560 --> 01:20:27.560]   No, no, no, no, no.
[01:20:27.560 --> 01:20:29.280]   I know of Scott Kids.
[01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:32.720]   I don't know who that might be.
[01:20:32.720 --> 01:20:34.320]   You might-- yeah, I love that line.
[01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:35.160]   None that I know of.
[01:20:35.160 --> 01:20:36.520]   Where's that from?
[01:20:36.520 --> 01:20:36.920]   I don't know.
[01:20:36.920 --> 01:20:38.920]   It sounds kind of got to build Murray feelings.
[01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:39.360]   None that I know of.
[01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:39.760]   I don't know.
[01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:40.640]   It's more to me.
[01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:43.440]   It more sounds like something from Blades of Glory or--
[01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:44.360]   Oh, sure.
[01:20:44.360 --> 01:20:44.840]   Sure, sure.
[01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:45.040]   Yeah.
[01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:47.520]   It's a Will Ferrell kind of a thing.
[01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:48.040]   Love Will Ferrell.
[01:20:48.040 --> 01:20:49.120]   Maybe a Talladega night.
[01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:50.360]   None that I know of.
[01:20:50.360 --> 01:20:52.440]   Did you see his follow up to Baby Landlord?
[01:20:52.440 --> 01:20:53.880]   Yeah, there's a new one.
[01:20:53.880 --> 01:20:54.640]   With the cop.
[01:20:54.640 --> 01:20:56.560]   Is that on Funny or Die as well?
[01:20:56.560 --> 01:20:57.000]   Yeah.
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:57.640]   Yeah.
[01:20:57.640 --> 01:21:00.200]   I wonder if Will would sue us if we play just a little bit of it
[01:21:00.200 --> 01:21:22.440]   and told everybody to go to F
[01:21:22.440 --> 01:21:24.000]   It is pretty funny.
[01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.120]   Her leech is-- we're going to play a game.
[01:21:26.120 --> 01:21:27.720]   It's going to be fun.
[01:21:27.720 --> 01:21:28.800]   This is her mommy's.
[01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:29.800]   Stand still.
[01:21:29.800 --> 01:21:30.320]   Oh.
[01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:32.640]   And you're going to say, where's the rent?
[01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:34.840]   Where's the rent go?
[01:21:34.840 --> 01:21:37.600]   Hey, I'll get back here.
[01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:38.720]   It's actually pretty funny.
[01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:40.800]   Girl, where's the rent?
[01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:42.360]   It's the rent.
[01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:43.360]   But there's the rent.
[01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:43.880]   Look at that.
[01:21:43.880 --> 01:21:44.880]   Look at that.
[01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:45.360]   He looks at him.
[01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:48.160]   It must have taken them a year to do this.
[01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:50.920]   You got to get my drink on.
[01:21:50.920 --> 01:21:52.600]   Did they talk about that one in there?
[01:21:52.600 --> 01:21:54.680]   Oh, there's the one where she's walking around with the beer.
[01:21:54.680 --> 01:21:56.480]   I think that's what freaked a lot of people are.
[01:21:56.480 --> 01:21:57.000]   Yeah.
[01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:58.480]   And it's not Will's kid.
[01:21:58.480 --> 01:21:59.760]   It's his partner's kid, right?
[01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:01.440]   It's Adam McKay's kid.
[01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:01.960]   Yeah.
[01:22:01.960 --> 01:22:06.440]   And Adam said, next day, she didn't remember any of this stuff.
[01:22:06.440 --> 01:22:07.760]   It's just fun.
[01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:08.800]   I don't know.
[01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:09.960]   People do stuff with their kids.
[01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:10.320]   I don't know.
[01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:11.440]   I might not do it.
[01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:11.960]   OK.
[01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:13.240]   It's their kid.
[01:22:13.240 --> 01:22:14.760]   They have custody.
[01:22:14.760 --> 01:22:16.200]   Oh, so people will dress it up.
[01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:18.480]   And I like the Seminoles t-shirt,
[01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:21.920]   but putting it in a hilarious video is like that.
[01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:24.480]   By forcing your child to have political messages
[01:22:24.480 --> 01:22:25.520]   on its tiny chest on your head.
[01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:26.520]   That's a good point.
[01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:27.240]   That's right.
[01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:28.280]   That's OK, you know?
[01:22:28.280 --> 01:22:28.920]   Right.
[01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:30.960]   I like the Seminoles.
[01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:32.280]   All right.
[01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:37.160]   I think we're ready for our picks of the week, software,
[01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:39.760]   or hardware, things that you like.
[01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:41.240]   You want everybody to get.
[01:22:41.240 --> 01:22:44.560]   I'm going to start because I got an email
[01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:46.520]   from a high school student who listens.
[01:22:46.520 --> 01:22:48.120]   Who's a big fan.
[01:22:48.120 --> 01:22:49.760]   And he said, you know, I'd love it if sometime you
[01:22:49.760 --> 01:22:53.280]   mentioned my program, which is pretty funny that now a day's
[01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:54.520]   high school kids are--
[01:22:54.520 --> 01:22:56.080]   they've got businesses.
[01:22:56.080 --> 01:22:57.960]   And he writes a little program you might have heard of
[01:22:57.960 --> 01:23:00.520]   called Docables.
[01:23:00.520 --> 01:23:04.760]   In fact, he just won an Apple award for Docables.
[01:23:04.760 --> 01:23:05.640]   Go decorate--
[01:23:05.640 --> 01:23:07.720]   iPhone apps.
[01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:08.880]   They also do the iPhone apps.
[01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:09.240]   You're right.
[01:23:09.240 --> 01:23:09.960]   They do an iPhone app.
[01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:13.920]   It's called Cocoaapp is the name of the site, cocoaapp.com.
[01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:17.200]   And Docables gives you one-click system event access
[01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:19.040]   from your OS 10 Doc.
[01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:22.520]   So they've got little items that will shut you down, restart.
[01:23:22.520 --> 01:23:24.000]   And they're just little--
[01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:25.240]   it's free.
[01:23:25.240 --> 01:23:26.960]   Just little things that go on your Doc for things
[01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:31.160]   that you might do a lot, which is, I think, it's simple.
[01:23:31.160 --> 01:23:32.040]   It's freeware.
[01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:32.960]   But I think it's very cool.
[01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:34.440]   And this is a high school kid who did it.
[01:23:34.440 --> 01:23:35.600]   That's really useful.
[01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:36.800]   Isn't that cool?
[01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:37.720]   Yeah.
[01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:39.480]   I just love it that--
[01:23:39.480 --> 01:23:42.560]   I only find his name because I should give him credit.
[01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:45.960]   He said, would you talk about my program?
[01:23:45.960 --> 01:23:47.120]   I said, of course I would.
[01:23:47.120 --> 01:23:49.640]   I think that's fantastic.
[01:23:49.640 --> 01:23:52.600]   He's a regular listener.
[01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:54.120]   His name is Corey Bahon.
[01:23:54.120 --> 01:23:56.280]   He's a senior in high school.
[01:23:56.280 --> 01:24:01.040]   It's now in the 10 top downloads list at apple.com.
[01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:03.320]   And he says, I'm trying to get my software and my company
[01:24:03.320 --> 01:24:03.760]   off the ground.
[01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:08.520]   He's also creating some iPhone software at cocoaapp.com.
[01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:11.440]   So Corey, there's your little plug.
[01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:15.600]   Have you played with his iPhone stuff, Scott?
[01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:18.480]   We get so many emails about that stuff
[01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:21.760]   that we haven't weeded our way through about 10% of it yet.
[01:24:21.760 --> 01:24:24.680]   So I've got a lot of apps now.
[01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:26.920]   And good sites in these sites that are cropping up
[01:24:26.920 --> 01:24:27.800]   look pretty good.
[01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:29.840]   I like the sites that aggregate the apps
[01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:33.200]   and give you an interface onto the iPhone.
[01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:35.240]   Did you see Get Leaflets?
[01:24:35.240 --> 01:24:36.080]   No.
[01:24:36.080 --> 01:24:37.280]   That's a new one.
[01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:39.000]   G-E-T, well, it's a pretty one.
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:43.160]   G-E-T, Leaflets, LEAF, L-E-T-S, GetLeaflets.com.
[01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:44.760]   If you look at it in Safari on a Mac,
[01:24:44.760 --> 01:24:49.840]   does it give you the same look as you'd get an iPhone or no?
[01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:51.520]   I don't think so.
[01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:53.760]   Yeah, most of these you have to actually look at them
[01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:54.440]   on an iPhone.
[01:24:54.440 --> 01:24:55.480]   Or it senses I see.
[01:24:55.480 --> 01:24:57.240]   It senses the iPhone.
[01:24:57.240 --> 01:24:58.440]   So this is blue flavor.
[01:24:58.440 --> 01:25:01.880]   Leaflets are fun, useful applications designed to run fast.
[01:25:01.880 --> 01:25:05.800]   Oh, they've got upcoming, flicker, delicious, newsvine,
[01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:07.160]   Tour de France, New York Times.
[01:25:07.160 --> 01:25:08.040]   That's cool.
[01:25:08.040 --> 01:25:11.120]   Yeah, this is exactly the kind of development I had hoped for.
[01:25:11.120 --> 01:25:13.800]   At the same time, I feel like it's second class
[01:25:13.800 --> 01:25:17.360]   because you have to go to Safari to do it, which drives me crazy.
[01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:18.840]   It is crazy.
[01:25:18.840 --> 01:25:19.360]   It's crazy.
[01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:22.560]   I had kinds of applications that would be so great.
[01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:26.120]   Well, like a-- and you know, you should be eventually
[01:25:26.120 --> 01:25:29.040]   a point where a year or whatever from now,
[01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:31.480]   where you can have some kind of option, key thing you push down.
[01:25:31.480 --> 01:25:32.760]   You can move those buttons around.
[01:25:32.760 --> 01:25:34.120]   You can change whatever you want.
[01:25:34.120 --> 01:25:35.080]   They'll be like widgets.
[01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:36.200]   They'll be like widgets.
[01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:38.640]   I think it's the only way to do it.
[01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:39.280]   This is cool.
[01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:40.880]   They do a nice job, Leaflets.
[01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:45.560]   Anyway, Docables Free Fun, not a big deal, little thing,
[01:25:45.560 --> 01:25:46.160]   but very cool.
[01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:48.560]   CocoApp.com.
[01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:50.480]   Do you want to make Leaflets your pick Merlin,
[01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:51.760]   or do you have something else?
[01:25:51.760 --> 01:25:53.320]   I got something else.
[01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:55.480]   Yeah, I can't-- Merlin can't really do an iPhone pick.
[01:25:55.480 --> 01:25:57.400]   That just wouldn't be right.
[01:25:57.400 --> 01:25:59.560]   I get a bad rap.
[01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:01.560]   I--
[01:26:01.560 --> 01:26:05.720]   Do we take bets on how long before Merlin has an iPhone?
[01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:08.160]   Apparently, I'm supposed to buy one any game now.
[01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:08.920]   Really?
[01:26:08.920 --> 01:26:09.920]   Is that what it says?
[01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:11.960]   Apparently.
[01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:12.480]   Thanks, Scott.
[01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:14.080]   You can't give him one if we have this bet.
[01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:15.160]   So I mean, we shouldn't do it.
[01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:16.600]   According to the great good he'd mess,
[01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:18.600]   as I should already be picking one up.
[01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:20.160]   I'll tell you what I did do.
[01:26:20.160 --> 01:26:23.840]   I'd finally dropped 1/20th of--
[01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:24.360]   Alex.
[01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:24.880]   --actually wasn't--
[01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:25.640]   --1/20th of an Alex.
[01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:26.360]   How much was it?
[01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:30.640]   Well, I dropped a part of an Alex on that scanner
[01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:32.080]   that I was talking about.
[01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:33.400]   And you're happy with it.
[01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:34.560]   Well, this--
[01:26:34.560 --> 01:26:37.000]   It arrived last week while we were talking.
[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:38.280]   What scanner is this?
[01:26:38.280 --> 01:26:43.880]   So long story short, Fujitsu makes a really fast scanner.
[01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:44.720]   This is not my pick.
[01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:46.360]   This is context for my pick.
[01:26:46.360 --> 01:26:51.800]   But the ScanSnap S500M is a fully-macked compatible, super
[01:26:51.800 --> 01:26:54.040]   fast sheet-fed scanner.
[01:26:54.040 --> 01:26:55.640]   I'm reading right off the page here.
[01:26:55.640 --> 01:26:56.480]   But what does that mean?
[01:26:56.480 --> 01:26:58.360]   That means you take a bunch of crap
[01:26:58.360 --> 01:27:01.080]   that you need to get into an electronic format,
[01:27:01.080 --> 01:27:03.960]   and you throw it at this thing, and it just churns through it
[01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:05.240]   crazy fast.
[01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:08.200]   And it's very configurable via software.
[01:27:08.200 --> 01:27:10.080]   And you can say that once you--
[01:27:10.080 --> 01:27:12.840]   and basically, it's for making PDFs, essentially.
[01:27:12.840 --> 01:27:16.240]   And so I have this desire to get all my stuff out of paper
[01:27:16.240 --> 01:27:17.480]   and onto the Mac.
[01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:21.320]   And so it's back up a little and stuff, searchable.
[01:27:21.320 --> 01:27:23.040]   So the first step is getting this thing.
[01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:24.440]   And so far, I'm happy with it.
[01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:26.800]   It's a little costly, but I'm enjoying it.
[01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:28.480]   I'd say what I'm really liking, though,
[01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:31.240]   is a program called Yep, YEP.
[01:27:31.240 --> 01:27:32.120]   Oh, yeah.
[01:27:32.120 --> 01:27:34.320]   And yeah, but I don't know if we've done yet before.
[01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:37.520]   You can see Yep at Yep.that.com.
[01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:40.680]   And it's described somewhere as being like an iTunes interface
[01:27:40.680 --> 01:27:42.240]   for PDFs.
[01:27:42.240 --> 01:27:43.600]   And it's pretty sharp.
[01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:44.120]   It's--
[01:27:44.120 --> 01:27:47.080]   This is like what they're going to have in Leopard, kind of.
[01:27:47.080 --> 01:27:47.600]   I don't know.
[01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:48.280]   It could be.
[01:27:48.280 --> 01:27:51.560]   You throw all the PDFs on your Mac, really, on your whole,
[01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:52.320]   I guess, wherever.
[01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:53.240]   Throw them at this app.
[01:27:53.240 --> 01:27:54.760]   It catalogs all of them.
[01:27:54.760 --> 01:27:59.600]   If it's PDF that has words in it,
[01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:03.040]   you can actually have a great tags for you.
[01:28:03.040 --> 01:28:04.960]   It'll remember things like what--
[01:28:04.960 --> 01:28:06.240]   when you add things to this, it'll
[01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:09.040]   remember what data went in and so on.
[01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:11.200]   It's kind of like-- it does a lot of stuff similar to what
[01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:12.080]   DevInthink does.
[01:28:12.080 --> 01:28:15.160]   It's a little more lightweight and very heavily based on PDFs.
[01:28:15.160 --> 01:28:16.720]   There's a bookmarklet for Safari.
[01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:18.920]   So if you're on a page and want to turn it into a PDF,
[01:28:18.920 --> 01:28:20.720]   it's one click.
[01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:22.800]   So I just think it's really-- it's pretty neat.
[01:28:22.800 --> 01:28:25.320]   I didn't used to be such a big fan of PDFs.
[01:28:25.320 --> 01:28:28.400]   But ever since they became so heavily integrated into OS 10,
[01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:30.920]   I've kind of come around to them.
[01:28:30.920 --> 01:28:32.400]   And I just think it's a real neat program.
[01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:34.840]   I think it's another one of these programs along the lines
[01:28:34.840 --> 01:28:39.880]   of what is a delicious library where I think people are
[01:28:39.880 --> 01:28:43.520]   doing some nice work with taking the quality of experience
[01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:46.320]   of the core kind of iLife apps and bringing them
[01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:47.400]   to these different areas.
[01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:49.160]   This is part of the delicious generation.
[01:28:49.160 --> 01:28:50.760]   That's what they're calling these programs now.
[01:28:50.760 --> 01:28:51.960]   All right.
[01:28:51.960 --> 01:28:53.560]   It's called Yap.
[01:28:53.560 --> 01:28:54.960]   It's at yepthat.com.
[01:28:54.960 --> 01:28:57.040]   It's $34, which is $120 of an hour.
[01:28:57.040 --> 01:28:59.120]   That seems expensive for something like this.
[01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:01.120]   You think it's worth it, though?
[01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:01.840]   I don't know.
[01:29:01.840 --> 01:29:03.000]   I'm just getting started with it.
[01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:06.000]   But the ability to go in and expose all that to Spotlight
[01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:07.200]   is pretty powerful to me.
[01:29:07.200 --> 01:29:07.680]   Yeah.
[01:29:07.680 --> 01:29:10.920]   You already have-- if you have Devynthink Pro Office,
[01:29:10.920 --> 01:29:11.840]   one nice thing about--
[01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:14.080]   I think I've had Devynthink as a pick before.
[01:29:14.080 --> 01:29:15.120]   It's a really neat program.
[01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:17.480]   But Devynthink actually has built in OCR.
[01:29:17.480 --> 01:29:21.760]   So you can have the scanner point it straight at Devynthink
[01:29:21.760 --> 01:29:23.440]   and do the OCR.
[01:29:23.440 --> 01:29:25.000]   I'm still working out the OCR piece.
[01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:28.480]   I'll come back with more on the Scan Snap as I get it kind
[01:29:28.480 --> 01:29:29.160]   of tricked out.
[01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:30.240]   But--
[01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:30.760]   Yeah.
[01:29:30.760 --> 01:29:31.960]   Do you plan to put everything in there?
[01:29:31.960 --> 01:29:33.920]   Do you just kind of scan everything?
[01:29:33.920 --> 01:29:36.600]   I mean, for stuff like dealing with financial information,
[01:29:36.600 --> 01:29:37.560]   like having all that stuff--
[01:29:37.560 --> 01:29:38.920]   I love that.
[01:29:38.920 --> 01:29:40.520]   Being able to pull all that stuff out.
[01:29:40.520 --> 01:29:42.800]   And then I can just kind of keep a much more--
[01:29:42.800 --> 01:29:45.040]   I'm doing my 2006 taxes right now.
[01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:47.920]   And I just wish I had some sort of system like that.
[01:29:47.920 --> 01:29:48.240]   Yeah.
[01:29:48.240 --> 01:29:50.160]   I mean, so I have a pretty low-fi solution right now,
[01:29:50.160 --> 01:29:51.800]   which is every-- the first of every month,
[01:29:51.800 --> 01:29:53.680]   I start a new Manila folder.
[01:29:53.680 --> 01:29:54.520]   That's good.
[01:29:54.520 --> 01:29:55.880]   It's a receipt in there.
[01:29:55.880 --> 01:29:58.040]   But I mean, yeah, I don't know if this
[01:29:58.040 --> 01:29:59.400]   is going to be the perfect solution.
[01:29:59.400 --> 01:30:01.240]   But I have friends that have this.
[01:30:01.240 --> 01:30:03.080]   And there's a lot of blog posts out there about this.
[01:30:03.080 --> 01:30:04.880]   I'll write more about this on 43 folders as I go.
[01:30:04.880 --> 01:30:09.240]   But you can go out and-- if you Google on Fujitsu Scan Snap,
[01:30:09.240 --> 01:30:10.960]   you'll see some amazing stuff people are doing.
[01:30:10.960 --> 01:30:14.480]   One guy I saw who outsources a lot of what he does,
[01:30:14.480 --> 01:30:16.720]   Allah Tim Ferriss, outsources stuff to India.
[01:30:16.720 --> 01:30:17.880]   He does everything through this.
[01:30:17.880 --> 01:30:19.080]   He scans all this stuff.
[01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:20.360]   And he sends it to India.
[01:30:20.360 --> 01:30:20.680]   Yeah.
[01:30:20.680 --> 01:30:21.040]   Yeah.
[01:30:21.040 --> 01:30:23.320]   And it helps a lot with kind of the communication problems.
[01:30:23.320 --> 01:30:24.440]   He's like, he's got everything.
[01:30:24.440 --> 01:30:25.480]   Like, here's what you need.
[01:30:25.480 --> 01:30:27.720]   So he's using Indian accountants?
[01:30:27.720 --> 01:30:30.560]   He's using-- well, there's like amazing stuff you can do
[01:30:30.560 --> 01:30:31.560]   about source.
[01:30:31.560 --> 01:30:33.120]   I got to read that book.
[01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:33.880]   It's an interesting book.
[01:30:33.880 --> 01:30:36.160]   It's pretty squirrely, but it's a lot of fun.
[01:30:36.160 --> 01:30:38.000]   So yeah, so I'm going to say, yeah.
[01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.040]   And I just-- in passing, just because I much
[01:30:40.040 --> 01:30:42.360]   have much love for the Devan crew,
[01:30:42.360 --> 01:30:44.200]   Devan Think is also just a fan--
[01:30:44.200 --> 01:30:47.240]   Devan Think Pro in particular is a fantastic application
[01:30:47.240 --> 01:30:49.040]   for managing lots of--
[01:30:49.040 --> 01:30:50.920]   So we're up to four Merlin picks now.
[01:30:50.920 --> 01:30:52.960]   I just want to point out.
[01:30:52.960 --> 01:30:53.520]   Yeah, we are.
[01:30:53.520 --> 01:30:55.160]   In one, in one, four, in one.
[01:30:55.160 --> 01:30:56.600]   You get your money's worth of this show.
[01:30:56.600 --> 01:30:57.680]   Let me tell you.
[01:30:57.680 --> 01:30:58.760]   Is that compatible?
[01:30:58.760 --> 01:30:59.440]   I'm sorry.
[01:30:59.440 --> 01:31:01.560]   I did not mean to slip that many.
[01:31:01.560 --> 01:31:04.640]   That's fine.
[01:31:04.640 --> 01:31:09.280]   Let's head on to Scott Bourn to see what's next.
[01:31:09.280 --> 01:31:11.480]   Well, I'm surprised no one beat me to this,
[01:31:11.480 --> 01:31:15.000]   but first off, I want to preface this by saying,
[01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:16.800]   it is less than an Alex.
[01:31:16.800 --> 01:31:19.920]   My pick cost significantly less than an Alex.
[01:31:19.920 --> 01:31:21.400]   Well, that doesn't say much.
[01:31:21.400 --> 01:31:22.480]   Well, I'm beating up.
[01:31:22.480 --> 01:31:23.120]   What is an Alex?
[01:31:23.120 --> 01:31:24.200]   700 bucks now?
[01:31:24.200 --> 01:31:25.600]   700 bucks.
[01:31:25.600 --> 01:31:28.440]   So this is 100 bucks less than an Alex.
[01:31:28.440 --> 01:31:30.800]   It's a revolutionary new device.
[01:31:30.800 --> 01:31:32.000]   Is this the iPhone?
[01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:33.200]   The way things work.
[01:31:33.200 --> 01:31:35.080]   Is this the iPhone?
[01:31:35.080 --> 01:31:37.880]   It's a-- it has 8 gigabytes of storage.
[01:31:37.880 --> 01:31:38.320]   This is the iPhone.
[01:31:38.320 --> 01:31:41.920]   It allows you to surf the web, listen to music, watch videos,
[01:31:41.920 --> 01:31:42.840]   and talk on the phone.
[01:31:42.840 --> 01:31:44.160]   It is the iPhone.
[01:31:44.160 --> 01:31:45.560]   You can't pick the iPhone.
[01:31:45.560 --> 01:31:48.120]   You've been picking that since October.
[01:31:48.120 --> 01:31:48.880]   OK.
[01:31:48.880 --> 01:31:53.000]   In that case, my pick is G-Office for the iPhone.
[01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:53.680]   Oh, no.
[01:31:53.680 --> 01:31:54.720]   That's the Google Office.
[01:31:54.720 --> 01:31:55.840]   The Office?
[01:31:55.840 --> 01:31:57.360]   It is not Google Office, but the guy
[01:31:57.360 --> 01:31:59.000]   was pretty smart to name it G-Office,
[01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:00.560]   because everyone thinks it's Google Office.
[01:32:00.560 --> 01:32:04.200]   This is Kevin Warnock's little first ever word processor
[01:32:04.200 --> 01:32:04.800]   for the iPhone.
[01:32:04.800 --> 01:32:06.280]   It actually works.
[01:32:06.280 --> 01:32:07.240]   Oh, yeah.
[01:32:07.240 --> 01:32:10.160]   I saw his blog posting, and he was all excited about scobles
[01:32:10.160 --> 01:32:10.800]   seeing it.
[01:32:10.800 --> 01:32:11.920]   I remember this.
[01:32:11.920 --> 01:32:13.000]   Yeah, it really does work.
[01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.920]   Now, it's-- if you're looking for--
[01:32:15.920 --> 01:32:16.920]   I tried it.
[01:32:16.920 --> 01:32:17.840]   I signed up for--
[01:32:17.840 --> 01:32:19.440]   what's cool about it is you don't have to have an account.
[01:32:19.440 --> 01:32:22.200]   You just create it, and it saves it.
[01:32:22.200 --> 01:32:24.560]   Yeah, and what's really cool is if you want,
[01:32:24.560 --> 01:32:27.680]   they'll actually mail out a hard document for you.
[01:32:27.680 --> 01:32:29.000]   How much does that cost?
[01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:29.720]   Three bucks.
[01:32:29.720 --> 01:32:31.240]   That's a good deal.
[01:32:31.240 --> 01:32:33.800]   And for four bucks, they'll put it on bond paper.
[01:32:33.800 --> 01:32:36.560]   And if you ask, they'll put a love stamp on it for free.
[01:32:36.560 --> 01:32:38.080]   Aww.
[01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:40.120]   So you can write a love note that way.
[01:32:40.120 --> 01:32:44.400]   But if you just needed to do a deal memo with somebody,
[01:32:44.400 --> 01:32:46.880]   real quick, standing there, hey, let's just agree to terms,
[01:32:46.880 --> 01:32:48.720]   they're actually going to come up with some templates
[01:32:48.720 --> 01:32:51.400]   he told me about, that you could just click what you wanted
[01:32:51.400 --> 01:32:52.720]   the thing, hit a button.
[01:32:52.720 --> 01:32:53.520]   There it is.
[01:32:53.520 --> 01:32:54.520]   You both click every--
[01:32:54.520 --> 01:32:55.960]   Great idea.
[01:32:55.960 --> 01:32:56.760]   Yeah.
[01:32:56.760 --> 01:32:59.520]   And hey, it's goffice.com.
[01:32:59.520 --> 01:33:00.000]   Give it a look.
[01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:01.440]   If you're looking for a word and you're
[01:33:01.440 --> 01:33:03.800]   looking at your power word user, you're not going to like it.
[01:33:03.800 --> 01:33:06.840]   But if you're looking for a way to make something on your iPhone,
[01:33:06.840 --> 01:33:07.840]   you can send to somebody.
[01:33:07.840 --> 01:33:08.600]   This works.
[01:33:08.600 --> 01:33:10.360]   And templates would make a big difference
[01:33:10.360 --> 01:33:11.280]   in making this functional.
[01:33:11.280 --> 01:33:11.800]   If you could just--
[01:33:11.800 --> 01:33:14.160]   And they've got some templates now, which frankly
[01:33:14.160 --> 01:33:15.480]   are a little lame, and they know that.
[01:33:15.480 --> 01:33:17.400]   They're going to redo those.
[01:33:17.400 --> 01:33:19.280]   Keep in mind, this thing's been out for weeks.
[01:33:19.280 --> 01:33:22.440]   He developed at the Dev Conference, didn't he?
[01:33:22.440 --> 01:33:23.680]   Well, he launched it there.
[01:33:23.680 --> 01:33:25.760]   He'd actually been working on it two weeks before.
[01:33:25.760 --> 01:33:28.960]   But it's an ongoing, evolving product.
[01:33:28.960 --> 01:33:30.080]   That's where I talked with him.
[01:33:30.080 --> 01:33:32.000]   And that's where I learned about it and tried it.
[01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.120]   And it really is pretty interesting.
[01:33:34.120 --> 01:33:35.640]   I mean, it shows the kind of--
[01:33:35.640 --> 01:33:38.560]   I mean, this is not the be-all-end-all word processor
[01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:39.520]   for the iPhone, I'm sure.
[01:33:39.520 --> 01:33:41.080]   But it's a good start.
[01:33:41.080 --> 01:33:43.640]   And it shows the kind of thing that people are probably
[01:33:43.640 --> 01:33:45.160]   going to be able to do in the future.
[01:33:45.160 --> 01:33:46.520]   Goffice.
[01:33:46.520 --> 01:33:47.840]   G-office.
[01:33:47.840 --> 01:33:48.800]   G-office.
[01:33:48.800 --> 01:33:49.240]   That come.
[01:33:49.240 --> 01:33:52.320]   Finally, Alex Ben Lindsey.
[01:33:52.320 --> 01:33:53.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:33:53.360 --> 01:33:57.440]   So the-- mine is 1/7 of myself.
[01:33:57.440 --> 01:34:00.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:34:00.560 --> 01:34:02.840]   1/7 of myself.
[01:34:02.840 --> 01:34:04.320]   1/7 of myself.
[01:34:04.320 --> 01:34:05.040]   This I showed.
[01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:06.600]   You can name it for an autobiography.
[01:34:06.600 --> 01:34:07.600]   Yes.
[01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:09.120]   Yeah, that's it.
[01:34:09.120 --> 01:34:11.040]   I'm now 1/7 of myself working with--
[01:34:11.040 --> 01:34:13.240]   You write that when you're about 11 years old.
[01:34:13.240 --> 01:34:14.200]   Exactly.
[01:34:14.200 --> 01:34:19.760]   So this one, we showed on the lab last week.
[01:34:19.760 --> 01:34:21.760]   This is called PFO.
[01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:22.760]   And it's--
[01:34:22.760 --> 01:34:24.200]   Excuse me?
[01:34:24.200 --> 01:34:25.200]   I know.
[01:34:25.200 --> 01:34:26.040]   We showed it on the lab.
[01:34:26.040 --> 01:34:27.200]   I said the same thing.
[01:34:27.200 --> 01:34:29.520]   I said, it's H-O-E.
[01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:30.840]   OK.
[01:34:30.840 --> 01:34:34.080]   You have to understand that they also make PFO.
[01:34:34.080 --> 01:34:35.080]   PFO.
[01:34:35.080 --> 01:34:36.120]   Road grader.
[01:34:36.120 --> 01:34:37.920]   So it's a company called Pixel Farm.
[01:34:37.920 --> 01:34:38.280]   And--
[01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:39.680]   Yes, Gfchan.
[01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:40.160]   And--
[01:34:40.160 --> 01:34:40.680]   Gfch.
[01:34:40.680 --> 01:34:41.180]   --pfch.
[01:34:41.180 --> 01:34:41.680]   --pfch.
[01:34:41.680 --> 01:34:42.680]   --pfch.
[01:34:42.680 --> 01:34:43.360]   Yeah.
[01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:48.280]   So they make lots of products that relate
[01:34:48.280 --> 01:34:51.320]   for the visual effects industry to what we call
[01:34:51.320 --> 01:34:51.920]   match moving.
[01:34:51.920 --> 01:34:53.840]   So the idea is that we have a camera move.
[01:34:53.840 --> 01:34:55.480]   Let's say we've done a handheld camera move,
[01:34:55.480 --> 01:34:58.080]   and we want to add something that looks like it's moving
[01:34:58.080 --> 01:35:01.400]   exactly the same way as our camera was moving.
[01:35:01.400 --> 01:35:03.680]   But we weren't doing anything on the set.
[01:35:03.680 --> 01:35:05.000]   We just need to reverse engineer it.
[01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000]   We need to look at the pixels and figure out
[01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.120]   where was the camera-- where would the camera have to be
[01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:11.240]   to make those pixels do what they're doing?
[01:35:11.240 --> 01:35:15.160]   And anyway, so what it does is the reason that this is
[01:35:15.160 --> 01:35:18.400]   interesting is that it's only-- it's $100.
[01:35:18.400 --> 01:35:20.680]   And normally, a lot of this stuff is like $1,000
[01:35:20.680 --> 01:35:24.000]   and $2,000 and $3,000.
[01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.360]   The great thing about it is it's really easy to use.
[01:35:26.360 --> 01:35:28.560]   It has a little wizard, and you put the video in it,
[01:35:28.560 --> 01:35:30.040]   and say, do this, do this, do this.
[01:35:30.040 --> 01:35:32.000]   And it just puts it together for you.
[01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:37.200]   And for those of you using Final Cut Pro Studio,
[01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:40.640]   it's the only tracker right now that exports a motion file.
[01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:43.240]   So it actually exports a motion project file that
[01:35:43.240 --> 01:35:46.760]   has the camera moving in it, because motion now supports 3D.
[01:35:46.760 --> 01:35:49.680]   And so it's a great little tool.
[01:35:49.680 --> 01:35:51.120]   It's really easy to use.
[01:35:51.120 --> 01:35:53.600]   If you're already using motion and you
[01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:55.200]   want to add motion graphics for instance,
[01:35:55.200 --> 01:35:58.080]   wrapping around someone while you're doing a handheld shot,
[01:35:58.080 --> 01:36:01.200]   it makes it super simple to kind of throw that stuff together.
[01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:04.320]   So that's my recommendation for the week.
[01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:06.360]   I know you guys do this all day and all the time,
[01:36:06.360 --> 01:36:08.040]   but I'm sorry.
[01:36:08.040 --> 01:36:09.920]   I don't understand what he said, but I'm sure--
[01:36:09.920 --> 01:36:11.640]   My brain is melting.
[01:36:11.640 --> 01:36:13.080]   There's all pops and buzzes from here.
[01:36:13.080 --> 01:36:14.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:36:14.080 --> 01:36:17.080]   [SPEAKING SPANISH]
[01:36:17.080 --> 01:36:19.640]   Ladies and gentlemen, we have come
[01:36:19.640 --> 01:36:21.760]   to the conclusion, the thrilling conclusion,
[01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:28.320]   of this episode of the iPhone Mac break show.
[01:36:28.320 --> 01:36:31.280]   I can't because you have an actual Apple phone
[01:36:31.280 --> 01:36:33.400]   show at applephoneshow.com.
[01:36:33.400 --> 01:36:36.280]   Leo, I think it's phone tip casting.
[01:36:36.280 --> 01:36:37.720]   Phone tip time.
[01:36:37.720 --> 01:36:40.640]   The problem is that I think there's actually more iPhone
[01:36:40.640 --> 01:36:44.040]   content in this show than there is in the Apple phone show.
[01:36:44.040 --> 01:36:45.920]   Yeah, that's because we have--
[01:36:45.920 --> 01:36:48.040]   An hour and 90 minutes to do this.
[01:36:48.040 --> 01:36:51.880]   We have roughly smaller bladders over at the Apple phone show
[01:36:51.880 --> 01:36:53.040]   than you do at the Mac break weekly.
[01:36:53.040 --> 01:36:54.400]   Thank God for the mute button.
[01:36:54.400 --> 01:36:55.240]   That's all I'm saying.
[01:36:55.240 --> 01:36:56.680]   Loomly.
[01:36:56.680 --> 01:36:57.200]   Yeah.
[01:36:57.200 --> 01:36:59.160]   I always carry a bottle with me everywhere I go.
[01:36:59.160 --> 01:37:01.000]   Yes, if you want to pick up this conversation,
[01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:02.640]   applephoneshow.com, thank you very much.
[01:37:02.640 --> 01:37:03.800]   Lots of great information.
[01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:05.760]   And actually, I subscribe to your feed
[01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:08.520]   because the blog has all sorts of good things.
[01:37:08.520 --> 01:37:10.880]   Actually, what I really do is I watch you on Jiku
[01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:12.600]   and all the new articles go up there.
[01:37:12.600 --> 01:37:15.920]   And actually, I get a lot of my news from your Jiku feed.
[01:37:15.920 --> 01:37:17.080]   I'm glad to be of service, sir.
[01:37:17.080 --> 01:37:21.000]   Is that applephoneshow.jiku.com?
[01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:22.080]   You know, I have no idea.
[01:37:22.080 --> 01:37:22.680]   What are you?
[01:37:22.680 --> 01:37:23.960]   Scott Borne at Jiku.com.
[01:37:23.960 --> 01:37:24.640]   I can't remember.
[01:37:24.640 --> 01:37:27.000]   Anyway, just go on to Jiku and you'll find--
[01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:28.680]   Search for me by name.
[01:37:28.680 --> 01:37:29.760]   I'm on there.
[01:37:29.760 --> 01:37:34.760]   Yeah, and there's also a very useful Apple or iPhone
[01:37:34.760 --> 01:37:35.840]   channel on there.
[01:37:35.840 --> 01:37:37.520]   And I subscribe to that.
[01:37:37.520 --> 01:37:40.200]   And you get a lot of good information that way.
[01:37:40.200 --> 01:37:41.480]   It's very useful.
[01:37:41.480 --> 01:37:43.600]   I think that's a great use of the Jiku technology.
[01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:44.640]   I agree.
[01:37:44.640 --> 01:37:47.360]   I've spent so much time on Pounce now
[01:37:47.360 --> 01:37:49.000]   that I feel like I'm neglecting Jiku.
[01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:50.000]   But thanks to the feed--
[01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.440]   I don't know exactly how do you--
[01:37:52.440 --> 01:37:54.800]   You know, it's like Twitter.
[01:37:54.800 --> 01:37:55.300]   OK.
[01:37:55.300 --> 01:37:56.880]   OK, because I signed up and I was kind of like, OK,
[01:37:56.880 --> 01:37:57.680]   now what I know--
[01:37:57.680 --> 01:37:58.480]   Just put stuff in there.
[01:37:58.480 --> 01:38:00.280]   The thing is you have your friends.
[01:38:00.280 --> 01:38:01.800]   And so if you send stuff to your friends,
[01:38:01.800 --> 01:38:02.880]   it just goes to your friends.
[01:38:02.880 --> 01:38:04.520]   Like you're my friend, and Berlin's my friend,
[01:38:04.520 --> 01:38:05.600]   Scott's my friend.
[01:38:05.600 --> 01:38:06.440]   You're my friend.
[01:38:06.440 --> 01:38:07.960]   You're my friend.
[01:38:07.960 --> 01:38:09.680]   But you can also send to the public,
[01:38:09.680 --> 01:38:11.520]   which is everybody who's following you.
[01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:13.280]   Public's my friend.
[01:38:13.280 --> 01:38:15.600]   Public is your only friend.
[01:38:15.600 --> 01:38:17.720]   And then you can also send it in--
[01:38:17.720 --> 01:38:19.760]   Because you can control who you send it to.
[01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:21.360]   That's one of the big differences.
[01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:23.120]   The other difference is that it has file types.
[01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:24.440]   So there's messages, which Twitter has.
[01:38:24.440 --> 01:38:26.680]   But it also links files.
[01:38:26.680 --> 01:38:27.720]   You can upload files.
[01:38:27.720 --> 01:38:31.160]   If you're a pro, you can upload to 100 megabytes of files.
[01:38:31.160 --> 01:38:32.800]   And also you can have an event type.
[01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:34.040]   So it's very useful.
[01:38:34.040 --> 01:38:36.040]   People are uploading indie music and stuff.
[01:38:36.040 --> 01:38:37.360]   And it's got a little player in there,
[01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:38.360]   and you can listen to it.
[01:38:38.360 --> 01:38:40.840]   It's kind of cool that way.
[01:38:40.840 --> 01:38:45.280]   And then it also has better filtering than Jiku, which
[01:38:45.280 --> 01:38:46.000]   is nice.
[01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.560]   It has commenting on the posts like Jiku.
[01:38:48.560 --> 01:38:49.960]   Doesn't have RSS like Jiku.
[01:38:49.960 --> 01:38:51.280]   Doesn't have an API yet.
[01:38:51.280 --> 01:38:52.520]   But I hear they're getting close.
[01:38:52.520 --> 01:38:55.280]   To me, the RSS at Jiku is the cool thing.
[01:38:55.280 --> 01:38:55.800]   Exactly.
[01:38:55.800 --> 01:38:58.860]   Because, for instance, you put on your RSS feed
[01:38:58.860 --> 01:38:59.640]   Apple phone show.
[01:38:59.640 --> 01:39:01.760]   So now I see on your Jiku feed, I
[01:39:01.760 --> 01:39:03.760]   see all your articles as they go up.
[01:39:03.760 --> 01:39:04.240]   Yeah.
[01:39:04.240 --> 01:39:04.800]   It's very handy.
[01:39:04.800 --> 01:39:05.840]   And I haven't posted a lot.
[01:39:05.840 --> 01:39:07.560]   I've only posted a couple of times in Jiku in the last two
[01:39:07.560 --> 01:39:07.800]   days.
[01:39:07.800 --> 01:39:13.080]   But every time I upload a podcast or post on Pounce or anything
[01:39:13.080 --> 01:39:15.920]   like that, stuff will go up there, which is great.
[01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:19.000]   And you can post to Jiku from your iPhone.
[01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:19.440]   You can.
[01:39:19.440 --> 01:39:22.520]   They have m.jiku.com, which works on all mobile devices.
[01:39:22.520 --> 01:39:24.400]   It's actually a very good mobile interface.
[01:39:24.400 --> 01:39:26.520]   Pounce is doing that, too.
[01:39:26.520 --> 01:39:28.400]   Everybody should do that.
[01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:30.160]   Everybody get in line.
[01:39:30.160 --> 01:39:32.480]   It's time to file out single file, please.
[01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:37.760]   No touching the wax figures because they hold fingerprints.
[01:39:37.760 --> 01:39:44.040]   We'll be back at Madam 2 So's wax break weekly next week.
[01:39:44.040 --> 01:39:47.960]   Another thrilling gripping and heart stopping edition.
[01:39:47.960 --> 01:39:48.880]   We'll see you all next time.
[01:39:48.880 --> 01:39:50.400]   Another Mac break is broke.
