[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   We had so much fun last time,
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.500]   because, well, this is our thinking.
[00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.900]   If there's no news, just have a lot of people on the panel.
[00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.400]   (laughter)
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.200]   And, in fact, a little later on, I'm going to make teaching every--
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.800]   I'm talking about things.
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.600]   Yeah, each and every one of you make up a story
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.600]   to fill out the show.
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.000]   Let's start with our newest panelist
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.200]   from Macworld.com, senior editor Dan Moore.
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.700]   Great to have you, Dan.
[00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.900]   Great to be here, Leo. Thanks for having me.
[00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.700]   Where are you located?
[00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:14.300]   Wait a minute. Let's guess.
[00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.800]   Okay, everybody, guess where Dan is located?
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.400]   If you would like to look at my background,
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.400]   I don't know if you learned anything about it.
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.500]   Are there any clues in the background?
[00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.600]   Well, my apartment is reasonably sized.
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.600]   This is just the office.
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.600]   Okay, so he's not in New York.
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.600]   I live in Manhattan.
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.600]   Manhattan's out.
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.600]   Is he sweating?
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.600]   He's not sweating, but he's wearing a T-shirt,
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.600]   and he seems to have removed his hair.
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.600]   Yeah, just to cool off a little bit.
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:34.600]   Just to cool off a little bit.
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.600]   He has a Fight Club poster, but it's odd,
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.600]   because it doesn't look like it has Brad Pitt in it.
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:41.600]   I'm going for Moss Eyes.
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.600]   Oh, yeah, there it is.
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.600]   Okay.
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.600]   You think he's wearing?
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.600]   Moss Eyes Lee.
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:47.600]   It's my best friend.
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:48.600]   He's in a cantina.
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.600]   He's in a cantina.
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:50.600]   He's in a cantina.
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.600]   He's in a cantina.
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.600]   It's just an cantina.
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.600]   And Moss Eyes Lee.
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.600]   I'm going to flip over all the cards.
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.600]   I am in Somerville, Massachusetts, which is just outside of Austin.
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.600]   Yeah, you would not have guessed that, but very close to where Andy is located.
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.600]   Yes indeed.
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.600]   I, in fact, I've seen Andy from time to time socially.
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.600]   Wow.
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.600]   Indeed.
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:09.600]   Wow.
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.600]   Andy, not goes here from the Chicago Sun times.
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.600]   Andy and his flip-flop squirrel.
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.600]   Yeah, it's one bush squirrel.
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:22.600]   That is, I was in the public garden on Saturday and you just saw, I'm not joking.
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.440]   At least the half of dozen squirrels just like, splayed on the ground or beneath the tree
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.280]   or splayed on top of a root.
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.600]   It was like, as if they're saying, it's just too hot for me to see.
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.600]   I cannot believe I have fur.
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.600]   Okay.
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.600]   No more skin brewing.
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.800]   Which is unusual for a prey species, but it was okay because even the dogs were saying,
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.600]   look, it's too hot for me to be at the...
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.600]   Can we just consider that?
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.600]   Let's just say that I chased you, you ran away, I barked.
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:49.600]   Can we just...
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:50.600]   Punch the time clock.
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.600]   We'll pick it up again next week.
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.600]   We're now moving to Canada.
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.600]   Yeah.
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.600]   That's Alex Lindsey, who is back in studio with us again.
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.600]   It's crazy to have you two weeks in a row.
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:01.600]   I can't understand it.
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.600]   I don't believe it.
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.600]   Did you like my little classroom in Rwanda?
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:06.600]   That was amazing.
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:07.600]   Oh, that's right.
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:08.600]   You were a good lord.
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:09.600]   Now I'm really disjointed.
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.600]   So two weeks ago you were here, a week ago you were in Rwanda, now you're back again.
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:14.600]   Yes.
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:15.600]   That was fast.
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:16.600]   It was.
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.600]   It was, in fact, that wasn't the only places that I was.
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:20.600]   Yeah, I know.
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:21.600]   That Rwanda was very, very cool.
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.600]   That was really neat.
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:23.600]   That's the first lab.
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.600]   We have a second lab coming in this month and so we'll have another...
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:27.600]   Well, 40...
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.600]   49 acts on my desk.
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:29.600]   Is it a...
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.600]   How does that work?
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.600]   Is it a paying school or are you subsidized?
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.600]   So the government is underwriting all the equipment costs.
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.600]   So we pay for the development and the government is paying for any staff costs directly.
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.600]   So they actually don't pay us for it.
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.600]   We hire these people.
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.200]   We hire them.
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.600]   And so it's a partnership between...
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.600]   It's in their interest, obviously.
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.600]   Well, they...
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.600]   Rwanda has built fiber through the entire country.
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:58.600]   I was having a dinner with the Minister of Youth and ICT and they were like, "Well, we built all these highways."
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.600]   Say that slowly because otherwise it sounds like you're euthanizing IT.
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.600]   Oh, the Minister of Youth and ICT.
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:05.600]   Youth and ICT.
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:10.600]   So it's really looking at how the younger population is going to use the internet in Rwanda.
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.600]   And they're very, very, very focused.
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.600]   I think it's forward thinking a lot of countries want to do this where they realize they can jump...
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:21.600]   They can literally leapfrog industrialization and go right to the information.
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:27.600]   Well, and what happened was that when Kagami took over, and Kagami is really the Steve Jobs of Africa.
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.600]   I mean, he's got this little president.
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:30.600]   He's the president.
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:31.600]   He's the president.
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.600]   And when he took over, he brought in all of these specialists.
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.600]   So these economists and from the West and from all over the world.
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:38.600]   Right.
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:39.600]   From the World Bank.
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.600]   Rwanda had prior to him through a horrific...
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:44.600]   He was the revolutionary leader that ended the genocide.
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:45.600]   Yeah.
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.600]   So he's the one that actually ended it.
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:48.600]   Yeah.
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:49.600]   And then started running.
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.600]   And of course it was very chaotic and very difficult.
[00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:53.600]   So he democratically elected?
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:54.600]   Yes.
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.600]   Yeah.
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:56.600]   Yeah.
[00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:57.600]   That's great.
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:58.600]   And so 92% approval.
[00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:59.600]   He won.
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:06.600]   Like, so when he starts speaking, anytime he shows up on the TV at a hotel or anything else,
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.600]   everyone just stops and just stares at the TV until he's done.
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.600]   And then they all go back to it.
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.600]   Not because they have to, just because they want to know what he's going to say.
[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:13.600]   Yeah.
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:14.600]   That's exciting.
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:15.600]   For a country that's definitely here like that.
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:16.600]   Yeah.
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.600]   He's extremely focused.
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.600]   But he brought all these economists in.
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.600]   And so one of the things that they pointed out was you don't have a lot of natural resources.
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:25.600]   And they have some natural gas.
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:26.600]   What are you going to do?
[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:27.600]   Yeah.
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:28.600]   You don't.
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:29.600]   You're a landlocked country.
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.600]   Agriculture.
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:35.600]   The problems that Rwanda had was largely connected to overpopulation because they're the densest population
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.600]   in Africa and one of the densest in the world.
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.600]   So how do you get out of that?
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.600]   And so they said, you know, information technology is one of the ways to do that.
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.600]   And so what they've done is they've invested massively in fiber.
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.600]   You know, and so they've got fiber loops going all through the country.
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:52.600]   They're bringing more and more fiber from the, you know, so they, you know, and they're
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:53.600]   still getting it all working.
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:59.600]   But it's, and so the issue they have is they've built this huge pipe to get data around, but
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.600]   they don't have anything to put in the pipe.
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.600]   So that's what our job is to train lots of people to generate content.
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.600]   And build video and training.
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:11.600]   I mean, it's a great opportunity for you and for the country.
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:12.600]   Oh, yeah.
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:13.600]   Well, yeah, it's a huge opportunity for both.
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.600]   I mean, we see it as an investment.
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.600]   We're not, you know, this isn't outreach or, I mean, it is.
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.600]   I mean, it's an outreach, but we really look at it as an investment.
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:24.600]   People who don't know you or may not know that this is something you've been very interested
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:26.600]   in Africa for a decade.
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:27.600]   Yeah.
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.600]   And have done other development projects there as well.
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:30.600]   Same idea.
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:31.600]   Yeah.
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:32.600]   And this has really been a focus of yours.
[00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:36.600]   And I think one of the things that you told me is that the movie industry is looking at places
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:40.600]   that they can go and get this work done, the CGI work done and so forth.
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:41.600]   Yeah.
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.600]   And I think all around the world in different time zones, and that's a real opportunity.
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:44.600]   It is.
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:48.600]   And I think that, I think that for Rwanda, I think that they will be generating, you know,
[00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:53.600]   everyone that we train will mostly be handling local demand for the next decade.
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:54.600]   Really?
[00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:56.600]   You know, yeah, there's just, because there's so much growth going on.
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:57.600]   That's exciting.
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:58.600]   There's work there to me.
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:02.600]   Well, we think that they will be doing some work that's from, you know, all over the world.
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:07.600]   We think that the vast majority of it is going to be stuff that is needed in the country.
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.600]   So there's a lot of stuff.
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:10.600]   Yeah, it's awesome.
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:11.600]   It's exciting to be there.
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.600]   Every time you're there, it's exciting because it's just so much happening.
[00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.600]   And there's buildings being built everywhere.
[00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.600]   And, you know, it's the ninth fastest growing country in the world.
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:19.600]   I mean, they're, wow.
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:20.600]   Yeah.
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:21.600]   It's, wow.
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:22.600]   Yeah.
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.600]   And it'll probably be in the top five next year.
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:28.600]   So also with us, I should say hi to Renee Richie from iMour.com.
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:29.600]   Good to see you, Renee.
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:32.600]   Sorry to be at the end of that tail end of that introduction.
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:35.600]   We had half an hour later and then there's Renee Richie.
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.600]   And I've gone nowhere and done nothing.
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:38.600]   Come on.
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:39.600]   I'm not gonna put myself now.
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:40.600]   You're keeping pretty busy.
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:41.600]   Keep it pretty busy.
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:42.600]   We saw it.
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:43.600]   We've seen a lot of you.
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.600]   In fact, Renee is in Montreal right now, but.
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:46.600]   Absolutely.
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.600]   And we, to make Alex feel better, we have a heat wave here too.
[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:51.600]   So there's no solace to be found even in Canada right now.
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:52.600]   Nowhere is it cool.
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.600]   It's flooding.
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.600]   We've got a Calgary flood in Toronto.
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:59.600]   But a heat wave in Montreal is like it's not snowing right now.
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:00.600]   Yeah.
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.600]   But no, but the water melts and then it rises up and we're swimming everywhere.
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.600]   Well, but it's great for your fit, but.
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:06.600]   Yeah.
[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:07.600]   Absolutely.
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:08.600]   We're all where, by the way, we compared.
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:10.600]   Are you wearing one too, Renee?
[00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:14.600]   I have a Nike fuel lying across the desk over there because it was hitting my keyboard when I was typing.
[00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:15.600]   So I took it off.
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:16.600]   It does a lot of good on that desk.
[00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:18.600]   It's really racking it up.
[00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.600]   Well, if I was walking during the show, you'll leave what y'all at me.
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:25.600]   The reason I'm interested in that is I got mine.
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.600]   This is my fifth fit.
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.600]   But the other four were the ones that you clip on your belt.
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:33.600]   One's in Paris, one's in the San Diego too, one's in my wash.
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:34.600]   And I never found the last one.
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:35.600]   I think I flushed it.
[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:36.600]   Are they still walking?
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:37.600]   Can you track them?
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:43.600]   You know, it's funny when I logged in, they said, "Oh, you're back."
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:46.600]   You know, would you like to replace your fit bit?
[00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:47.600]   I said, "Yes."
[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:48.600]   I'm going to use it.
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.600]   But this one I don't think I'll lose is fast.
[00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:51.600]   It's also less water.
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:10:05.600]   See, I think that shows a lack of sophistication on the fit bit software because the server should be programmed to say, "Either you've just found your fit bit, you've just replaced it, or someone has dug up your corpse and is calling it this place for fun to solve for parts."
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.600]   Should we call the police?
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.600]   This is a security issue there.
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:16.600]   But it does show me the calories I've consumed over the last two years, and it was very low for the last few months.
[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:20.600]   Anyway, I'm glad to have you all on here.
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:23.600]   You know, I said there was no news, but there's some news, for instance.
[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:26.600]   Happy birthday App Store, fifth anniversary.
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:27.600]   It's done okay.
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:28.600]   Yeah, you know.
[00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:32.600]   And they are giving away some free stuff.
[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:37.600]   I don't know who decided to give it away, but these are actually some very good Infinity Blade 2.
[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:39.600]   There will be no Infinity Blade 3, by the way.
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:40.600]   Oh, really?
[00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:41.600]   Well, I don't know.
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:42.600]   I think they gave up, right?
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.600]   Well, Infinity Blade Dungeon might be announced that the...
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:47.600]   Dungeons is dead, or no?
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:48.600]   Would you say Dan?
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:49.600]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:52.600]   I heard about when they demoed the Infinity Blade Dungeons, I remember, but I don't know.
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:53.600]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.600]   Like three iPads ago, they demoed an iPad 3.
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:00.600]   And then the team got let go, or I think something exchanged hands, and the team got let go,
[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:04.600]   and it was being reassigned, and now I think it's been killed by some rogue gamer.
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:07.600]   Less than infinite is what we're saying.
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:08.600]   Fine, I...
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:09.600]   Fine, I played.
[00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:10.600]   Fine, I played.
[00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:11.600]   It's a very different game.
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:12.600]   Mostly like a little knife.
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:13.600]   It's made out of wood.
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:18.600]   Yeah, the epic games shut down in possible studios.
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:23.600]   The game is on hold until Epic can find someone else to take over.
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:25.600]   That's the last we heard back in February.
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:27.600]   It was such a good idea when they started.
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.600]   It was so cool looking.
[00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.600]   Anyway, you can get the...
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:34.600]   It's predecessor, which is still a darn fine game.
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:37.600]   That's free right now for one more day, I think.
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:40.600]   Super Brothers, that's a really interesting game.
[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:42.600]   If you play that, Super Brothers, sort of sorcery.
[00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:43.600]   That's a great game.
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:46.600]   That's one of my favorite games for iOS in the last several years.
[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:47.600]   Me too.
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.600]   It's so atmospheric, the music is fantastic.
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:51.600]   I went and bought the soundtrack because it was so good.
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.600]   It's beautiful, like, chiptune music.
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:56.600]   Well, and what I like about it, it's different.
[00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:01.600]   I hate to see ports of existing games, because it's like, well, come on, let's do something
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:05.600]   that's native to the iPad, and this looks so different and so interesting.
[00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:08.600]   Even at least so intuitively too, which is kind of the fun.
[00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:11.600]   Half the fun is sort of discovering what you're doing, and then that moment.
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:16.600]   Of realization when you solve one of those puzzles, like, oh, I get it because of these
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:20.600]   things I did before, I can pinch this in this way, and this all comes together.
[00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:21.600]   It's native.
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:26.600]   It's iPad native, or I touch native anyway, because it is available for the iPhone as well.
[00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:27.600]   That's free.
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:30.600]   A good one to go run out and get right now.
[00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:31.600]   Let's see what else is free.
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:32.600]   Where's my water?
[00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:34.600]   Is that the one with the alligator?
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:35.600]   Yeah, it's a Disney.
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:36.600]   That's for kids.
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:39.600]   Bad land, I haven't seen that one.
[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:41.600]   That one's also supposed to be pretty cool.
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:44.600]   I think it's a side-scroller, but it has some gorgeous art too, I think.
[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:45.600]   It's one of these.
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:53.120]   I've played a lot of these where you kind of, oh, God, you've got to get through an environment
[00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:54.920]   by using physics.
[00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:57.200]   I believe that won an Apple design award.
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:58.200]   It's pretty gorgeous.
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:00.200]   It's year, I think.
[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:01.200]   Downloading now.
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.200]   You might as well get them all, folks.
[00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:03.200]   They're free.
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:05.800]   Let's see what else.
[00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:06.800]   Tiny wings.
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:07.800]   Oh, that's a great game.
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:08.800]   That's an older one.
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:09.800]   Oh, tiny wings.
[00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:10.800]   Oh, you would like tiny wings.
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:12.400]   I see very focused on my games.
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:14.000]   You like tower defense.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   Really like big tower defense.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.680]   I mean, it's nice because it's an indie.
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:21.280]   It's one guy basically putting the app together and he did it for iPhone and iOS and made
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:25.360]   a second version with more little birds and it's absolutely gorgeous too.
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:27.280]   There are some other freebies.
[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:33.200]   Those are the games, but other freebies include over, which allows you to put text over photos.
[00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:38.640]   I'm not sure I want to see a lot more of that, but okay.
[00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:39.640]   You can.
[00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:42.760]   Right on the internet.
[00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:46.000]   Tractor DJ, which is a very good DJ app.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.360]   Day one, which is a journaling app.
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:48.960]   I think you Andy recommended that.
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:49.960]   It's a great journal.
[00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:52.920]   As a matter of fact, had you not mentioned it, that would in my pick of the week against
[00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:53.920]   this week.
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:55.560]   No, we won't mention it.
[00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:56.560]   No, no, no, no.
[00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:57.560]   It's okay.
[00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:02.560]   Yeah, no, because it's a good idea to write something every single day.
[00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:04.200]   But it's such a pain in the butt to do it.
[00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:07.040]   Day one just makes it so effortless.
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:11.520]   Even if it just nudges, you'd say, how about you just say one sentence about how yesterday
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:12.520]   went or how today went?
[00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:13.520]   Great.
[00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:14.520]   No, that's fine.
[00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:15.520]   We'll take care of it.
[00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:16.520]   Yeah.
[00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:17.520]   And then in you just.
[00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:21.440]   It's like the Fitbit in that it encourages you without doing much to actively encourage
[00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:22.440]   you.
[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:26.080]   And then months later, when you just happen to look at, oh, wow, I actually have a really
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:31.520]   good timeline of all of the interesting things that I don't have a conscious thought of
[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:35.360]   ever sitting down and writing about a hugely interesting day that I had.
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:39.920]   But now that I'm scrolling back to, you know, May 21st, it turns out, oh, isn't that interest?
[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:41.280]   Oh, I'm glad I wrote that down.
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:43.280]   I would have forgotten all about that.
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:44.280]   That's free.
[00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:46.560]   Also free.
[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:52.000]   And you said you like this Alex potlucks over, which allows you also to put text in our work
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.560]   over photos.
[00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:54.560]   It's great.
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:55.800]   And that's definitely, you should definitely download that one.
[00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:56.800]   I want this one.
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:03.120]   This looks better than the other one that you put text in stuff over stuff.
[00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:06.360]   So barely there are two apps competing apps.
[00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:08.440]   Putting things on top of other things.
[00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:09.440]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:10.440]   That's a repeat of over.
[00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:11.680]   That's a different over or is it the same over?
[00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:12.680]   Okay.
[00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:17.160]   And how to cook everything, which is one of my, I would say the Mark Bitman's, my favorite
[00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:20.080]   cooking app for the iPad and iPhone.
[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:22.840]   And that one's nice because it's updating all the time for free.
[00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:25.080]   So well worth getting that for free now.
[00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:26.920]   And finally, I'm surprised this one's free.
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:27.920]   There it is.
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:28.920]   Mark Bitman's had to cook everything.
[00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:30.960]   Highly recommended.
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:32.760]   And then I'm surprised this is free.
[00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:35.920]   This is something everybody with kids should have the barefoot world atlas.
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:39.080]   In fact, if you don't have kids, you might want to have this.
[00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:42.240]   Just have it on your iPhone or your iPad to keep the kids busy.
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:46.400]   You know, if you run into kids, like there's somebody making noise in the coffee shop,
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:47.400]   hey kid, come here.
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:49.360]   Have you ever seen a kangaroo?
[00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:52.800]   How about a beating kangaroo?
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:55.960]   The leading exports of Canada are boxite.
[00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:56.960]   Promia.
[00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:57.960]   Maca.
[00:15:57.960 --> 00:15:59.960]   Don't you forget our potash.
[00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:03.840]   Hey, with that potash, there would be no something.
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:09.560]   Yeah, Canada is where bounty police come from.
[00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:11.320]   Tractor DJ is 20 bucks usually.
[00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:13.280]   So, you know, I mean, I just snagged these all.
[00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:15.200]   Oh, the tractor DJ, you have to get.
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:17.320]   Yeah, 20 bucks.
[00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:19.400]   Have to.
[00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:23.120]   That this is all free.
[00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:29.920]   According to ABC News, the companies making their apps free are not being paid.
[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:32.920]   Uncompensated by Apple for the loss of revenue.
[00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:33.920]   Yeah.
[00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:35.600]   So, they're going to lose a week's paid sales.
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:39.600]   I guess it's going to go on for a week, but I wouldn't wait.
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:40.800]   Make it up on volume.
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:41.800]   Yeah.
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:43.400]   Well, I mean, look at the publicity that they just got.
[00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:47.280]   We just talked about five apps we've mentioned and we should, you know, you should get them.
[00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:50.560]   But certainly, while they're free is now is the time to absolutely drag them, get them
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:51.560]   out.
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.760]   They're worth every penny at this point.
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:54.760]   Yeah.
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:59.400]   And so the fifth year, it's hard to believe it's been five years, but remember the iPhone
[00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:01.360]   came out in June 2007.
[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:05.320]   And we all complained that Apple was the only one developing apps.
[00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:06.320]   Remember that?
[00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:07.320]   Yeah.
[00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:09.560]   They said web apps were the way to go.
[00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:10.560]   Yeah.
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:11.560]   So we were like, pretty sweet.
[00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:13.880]   We want our own apps.
[00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:19.880]   And did you get, did anybody get the timeline, the Apple timeline, did they mail it to anybody
[00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:21.120]   because I didn't get it?
[00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:23.120]   My colleague, Lex Friedman, got one.
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:27.800]   Well, I can pull it up from Tim at Tim has posted it on Twitter.
[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:30.720]   He's a tech reporter at the Financial Times.
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:32.360]   And no, where is it?
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:33.360]   Where's the poster?
[00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:36.000]   He's got a tweet of the poster without the image.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   That's nice.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   There we go.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.680]   Boy, oh, this is a physical poster you can hang on the wall.
[00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:42.680]   Yeah.
[00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:45.640]   Because you get the digital one in the same place where they're giving away the apps on
[00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:46.640]   the app store.
[00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:49.640]   There's a milestones button and you've seen sort of scroll through like they did recently
[00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:53.640]   with the 10 years of the iTunes store where you can sort of go through here.
[00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:56.600]   Here are the big deals over the last five years in the app store.
[00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:58.760]   But I think that's just, yeah, they print out a paper version.
[00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:03.200]   So I'll have to print it out by hand since I'm not a, but none of you got it either?
[00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:04.200]   Nope.
[00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:05.200]   I'm surprised.
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:07.840]   It's probably because of your association with me.
[00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:09.400]   Go buy association.
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:15.920]   Print it next to your Simpsons poster Leo.
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:20.280]   I know I want a new Simpsons poster because I've completely redone my screen field.
[00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:22.880]   I need a new one.
[00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:24.920]   So is it, so where is it?
[00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:26.920]   Stan, is it on the app store?
[00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:29.120]   Yeah, it's in on the app store.
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:32.400]   If you hit up the app store on the main page, they have that same place where you go and
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:34.320]   find all the free apps.
[00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:37.800]   There's like a separate section next to it that says milestones.
[00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:42.360]   It was one of those things that surprisingly kind of a crappy design job for them.
[00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:43.360]   Yeah.
[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:44.360]   Maybe they rushed it out.
[00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:46.360]   They rushed it out.
[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:47.880]   They rushed it out.
[00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:49.800]   They're busy making apps free guys.
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:50.800]   Yeah.
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:52.200]   They just don't, they'll make themselves free.
[00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:53.200]   Someone's got to do that.
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:55.200]   They'll celebrate with free apps.
[00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:59.840]   I wish they did more of these because remember that remember when every single new product
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:04.920]   would come out with this incredibly cool art litho style poster associated with it.
[00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:09.320]   I mean, like this was of course back when they used to do Mac world expo, but it's like
[00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:13.280]   every time I'd grab like six or seven of these, one of them you'd lose because that
[00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:14.400]   would be like the rapper for the rest.
[00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:20.640]   But then you'd have like this cool rainbow iMac poster in your office for about two years.
[00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:29.200]   So it was July 10th 2008, the first the app store launched was 62 countries with 500 apps.
[00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:30.200]   Wow.
[00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:31.200]   Was it really July?
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:33.200]   I mean, because that was more than a year after a year.
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:36.120]   Oh, but the iPhone was announced in June, but didn't come out to September.
[00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:37.120]   Remember or something like that?
[00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:38.120]   No, it was announced in January.
[00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:39.120]   That's right.
[00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:40.120]   You're right.
[00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:41.120]   That's when I was.
[00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:42.720]   I think it was timed with the 3G launch, right?
[00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:43.720]   The iPhone 3.
[00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:44.720]   But it was a year.
[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:46.720]   Yeah, it was out for a year without any apps.
[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:47.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:48.720]   Wow.
[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:55.360]   New biography a year without apps 10 million apps downloaded within four days 10 million
[00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:57.560]   apps downloaded in the first weekend.
[00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:02.080]   Everyone thought super monkey ball was $10 Leo.
[00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:04.360]   Sega's super monkey ball.
[00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:06.920]   That's that sells something about the dearth of apps.
[00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:08.280]   They made $3 million though.
[00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:13.440]   I mean, people were willing to pay 10 bucks for 10 10 bucks.
[00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:17.680]   Shazam topped one and a half million downloads in September by December.
[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:23.960]   Facebook was the year's most downloaded app 5 million downloads.
[00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:30.320]   One billion were topped a year later April 4th, 2009.
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:33.360]   Doodle jump launches on the app store.
[00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:36.920]   That was in April 6th.
[00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:43.600]   Real racing in June, sports center in June, Jamie Oliver's 20 minute meals in October.
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:45.400]   Facebook and paper tossed with the number paper.
[00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:46.400]   Remember that was free.
[00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:48.800]   That's why it was a big right stupid game.
[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:49.800]   But I guess cool.
[00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:56.320]   I guess paper tossed the years top downloaded apps for 2009 2010.
[00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:59.640]   Angry Birds launches in February.
[00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:01.600]   That was a good that was a good month.
[00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:05.160]   I was a good month iPad goes on sale in April.
[00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:08.680]   That flicks on April 3rd time magazine April 30th.
[00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:11.800]   You really these timelines actually useful because you can you can absolutely see the
[00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:18.280]   growth of the store October 28th 2010 Instagram is the app of the week.
[00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:21.440]   I remember that my first Instagram had profanity in it.
[00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:24.600]   Because I thought nobody was looking.
[00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:25.600]   Stalled downhill.
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:26.600]   It was.
[00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:29.040]   And then I stupidly connected it to Twitter.
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:36.600]   So I tweeted profanity and it was a doubly profane sentence with three at three words in
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:39.320]   it two of which were filthy.
[00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:42.120]   And of course no one's looking at it.
[00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:43.560]   I got people.
[00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:44.960]   I got a teacher to set.
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:48.200]   I cannot follow you if you continue with this profanity.
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:51.200]   So Cosby was outraged Cosby was so upset.
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:52.600]   But they were okay with the picture of your butt.
[00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:56.240]   It was just the words that they build were upset with.
[00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:58.800]   Kind of was a picture of my butt actually.
[00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:05.080]   App Store downloads top 10 billion by January 2011 paper glider the 10 billionth app downloaded.
[00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:06.080]   What a surprise.
[00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:10.040]   Well as you're going to throw these people theme going on there.
[00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:11.040]   Yeah.
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:14.040]   As you're going through all these top these top like hit apps.
[00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:18.200]   How many of them went on the week of debut did what you have said?
[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:22.440]   It's a it's a app that takes normal looking pictures with a great camera and makes them
[00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:23.920]   look really really crummy.
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:24.920]   And it's right.
[00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:26.000]   Yet another social media service.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.600]   How many people would have guessed that it would become like.
[00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:29.600]   I didn't.
[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:33.160]   I knew when Sarah showed me Instagram and it was within the first week of its release.
[00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:36.520]   I am I jumped on with both feet and both hands.
[00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:39.200]   I just thought this is the greatest thing ever.
[00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:40.640]   And you know you got admitted.
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:43.080]   I agree with you and in your serious photographer.
[00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:46.600]   But you got you got to admit I still look at Instagram and I was a little worried that
[00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:48.320]   video would swamp the Instagram feed.
[00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:52.240]   I still see great images every single day on Instagram anything anything that encourages
[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:54.320]   people to take pictures is a good thing.
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:55.320]   Yeah.
[00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:58.640]   It's just it actually that I was I was I was bringing that up just to sort of like poke
[00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:03.160]   put it myself at sometimes if you either there there absence their hardware and software
[00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:04.560]   all of us that we look at it.
[00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:05.560]   Oh my God.
[00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:06.960]   This is the most wonderful thing ever.
[00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:10.840]   This is this is so different and so unique and does nothing.
[00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:16.440]   And then something that you said, okay, here's yet another like Bluetooth flashlight SMS app
[00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:18.840]   right that of the 19 that came up last week.
[00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:19.840]   It does do anything new.
[00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:21.280]   It does do anything particularly well.
[00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:23.520]   But there's something about it that causes.
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:24.520]   Okay.
[00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:26.520]   So now 93 million people are using it.
[00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:27.920]   Guess I should review it now.
[00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:28.920]   Yeah.
[00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:30.760]   Now I liked it right off the bat.
[00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:35.480]   I think because not only did it seem to foster photography, but it was a great way to stay
[00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:40.600]   in touch with people and I still stay in touch people because I follow their Instagram
[00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:41.600]   feed.
[00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:44.800]   I know what's going on with you, Andy, for instance, with a lot of people with Colin
[00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:49.600]   Kaepernick, the quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers who is apparently naked in his Instagram
[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:50.600]   feed today.
[00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:51.600]   The great public photo.
[00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:54.040]   If you look if you look like that.
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:55.040]   Yeah.
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:56.040]   Yeah.
[00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:58.840]   No, no, no, no, it's only complaints with people with that.
[00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:00.960]   Hey, Colin, that's number seven.
[00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:03.680]   Whoa, yeah, you know.
[00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:04.680]   Wow.
[00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:05.680]   He's been working out.
[00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:10.380]   And then of course, what would we do without the the the the the the brunch picks?
[00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:11.380]   Yes.
[00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:14.600]   You know, I know what I know what Julio has having for breakfast.
[00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:16.360]   So who are you?
[00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:19.160]   It's just, you know, it's it's fun.
[00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:21.780]   It's a way to publicly share a photo journal.
[00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:22.960]   It's just like your moments that you want to share with me.
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:24.880]   And where would I just being be?
[00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:28.800]   By the way, your discovery, Alex Lindsay at word camp Pittsburgh.
[00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:29.800]   Yep.
[00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:31.320]   Uh, when was that?
[00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:34.440]   We should do a timeline of a milestone of I just seen.
[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:36.400]   Oh, it was, I know it was the fall.
[00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:42.600]   It probably would have been 2005, but it was the fall before, um, the first Mac break.
[00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:44.760]   Oh, no, no, not the first and the second Mac break.
[00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:46.080]   So she was on Mac break.
[00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:50.800]   And then we did a Mac break weekly from the 21st Amendment brew pub upstairs.
[00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:51.800]   First time I met her.
[00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:52.800]   Yeah.
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:57.000]   When was sitting with a blackberry, by the way, typing or tweeting away or something.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.800]   Well, and I was baffled.
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:00.240]   Why is there a beautiful woman here?
[00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:03.880]   Because this is not normally she doesn't fit in a hangout for beautiful women.
[00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:05.320]   I just, I just say it.
[00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:11.040]   And it was like, I think the second of the first Mac break we did was with Emory and Amber
[00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:14.920]   and you and I, you know, where the first video one, the first video one was that Mac world
[00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:15.920]   Expo, right?
[00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:16.920]   Back world Expo.
[00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:21.560]   And then the second year I asked Justine and she was still in Pittsburgh and, um, I asked
[00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:25.560]   her if she'd come out and it was funny because somehow, of course, she shows up.
[00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:29.520]   The cover, you know, um, locations for us for, for Mac break.
[00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:30.520]   And she ends up on ABC news.
[00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:34.040]   And it was just, you know, it was just, you know, it was over, but she just, you could
[00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:35.040]   just tell them.
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:36.040]   Yeah.
[00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:39.040]   It was just, you know, absorbed attention.
[00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:40.800]   Ah, all right.
[00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:45.640]   Milestones, ladies and gentlemen, going back through time, Disney's where my water, where's
[00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:48.200]   my water was a 25th billion app downloaded.
[00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:49.960]   You know, can it compare again?
[00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:54.600]   I just, I'm not, I'm not telling the producers how to run the show, but if you want to loop
[00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:59.000]   in like back from music of sending the clowns an instrumental version, it just sounds like
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   his indeed.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:07.360]   Then 2006, a little app called Scribblebot Scribblebot is how to learn and love and share
[00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:08.360]   scripts.
[00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:10.400]   50 billion downloads May 16th.
[00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:15.800]   Remember when that clicked over 50 billion downloads more than $10 billion paid to developers
[00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:20.200]   and Apple celebrates five years of the app store on July 10th, which is tomorrow.
[00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:22.680]   It's a pretty incredible distribution of wealth.
[00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:24.320]   $10 billion.
[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:25.320]   And billion.
[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:27.200]   And that's 70%.
[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:28.200]   So Apple keeps 30%.
[00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:29.200]   Okay.
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:31.200]   So they're doing all right.
[00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:33.200]   A couple billion there.
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:34.200]   You're there.
[00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:35.200]   That's up.
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:36.200]   Check every once in a while.
[00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:39.000]   I do, you know, I mean, there's always been that question, does Apple make money on iTunes?
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.200]   Does Apple make being in the app store?
[00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:44.200]   And the only reason it would not is because of the costs of providing the downloads.
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:45.200]   I think it will make money.
[00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:46.200]   I don't know how to make money.
[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:47.200]   I'm subsidizing the free apps.
[00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:48.200]   Yeah.
[00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:50.760]   I mean, for years, they said that they were running just above break even.
[00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:52.760]   I think that's changed more recently.
[00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:54.920]   You haven't said much lately, have they, Dan?
[00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:57.560]   Yeah, I'm not so much.
[00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:02.720]   I think they're making money that Blackberry would love to see on their hardware end at
[00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:03.720]   this point.
[00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:06.320]   They're making money like they would love to see.
[00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:07.320]   Period.
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:09.680]   They're making Blackberry money now, baby.
[00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:13.120]   Probably any of their mobile competitors would love to see that money at this point.
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:14.120]   We're going to take a break.
[00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:15.120]   We'll come back.
[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:20.160]   Tim Cook has a secret meeting at Fort Mason Center.
[00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:21.480]   We had people in studio in Sunday.
[00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:22.880]   I swear we're here for that.
[00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:23.880]   They wouldn't tell me.
[00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:25.600]   He's competing in battle bots.
[00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:26.600]   Okay.
[00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:27.600]   There I said it.
[00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:28.600]   Yes.
[00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:29.600]   You ruined this surprise.
[00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:30.600]   All right.
[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:34.360]   We're going to take a break though and tell you where to get rid of your old stuff so that
[00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:36.240]   you can get the new stuff.
[00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:38.200]   There's always new stuff.
[00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:43.720]   And there will be soon new stuff from Apple and I would suggest that even though we don't
[00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:47.920]   know when the new stuff's going to arrive, now's the time to get a free 30 day locked
[00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:50.880]   in quote on your old stuff just in case.
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:51.880]   You just do that.
[00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:54.280]   It's just like every month you should just get another quote.
[00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:55.280]   Tell a little more and go off.
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:56.680]   Because I can tell you one thing.
[00:27:56.680 --> 00:28:00.520]   Your iPhone 5, your iPhone 4, it's not gaining in value.
[00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:04.080]   You know that you got to wait 50 years and then they'll be in teaks and then you could
[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:05.480]   sell them on eBay for a lot of money.
[00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:07.840]   But right now they're going down in value.
[00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:10.680]   So go to gazelle.com.
[00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:12.080]   By the way, break your phone.
[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:16.600]   They still will buy eye broken iPhones because there's value in those for parts.
[00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:18.320]   So consider that.
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:20.360]   And if you've got a rim.
[00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:22.120]   Get rid of it.
[00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:26.000]   Especially now before everyone realizes that it's not going to work any longer.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.920]   And you don't have a table with a wobbly leg.
[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:31.160]   They buy HTC.
[00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:32.160]   They buy LG.
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:36.560]   They buy Motorola Nokia phones, Samsung phones as well.
[00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:41.400]   You got an old Galaxy S3 that maybe you want to unload a Galaxy Note 2.
[00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:43.760]   Getting ready for a newer phone.
[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:44.760]   This is your chance.
[00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:47.880]   I'm just curious what the iPhones hold their value really well.
[00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:50.760]   I'm just curious what an S3 is worth today.
[00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:53.200]   This is the S3 GT.
[00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:54.360]   I'm surprised.
[00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:55.360]   165 bucks.
[00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:57.280]   How much is the S2?
[00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:58.280]   You think that's worth more?
[00:28:58.280 --> 00:28:59.880]   No, because I got to get rid of mine.
[00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:00.880]   You got one.
[00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:02.360]   Well, that's what I jumped on.
[00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:06.680]   I recommend a visit to G-A-Z-E-W-L-E.com.
[00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:07.680]   After the show.
[00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:08.680]   After the show.
[00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:10.680]   Find out what your phone is worth.
[00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:13.200]   They actually take more tablets than they used to now.
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:14.760]   They're using Samsung.
[00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:17.480]   Nexus tablets, Kindle Fire, Microsoft Surface.
[00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:18.480]   You can resell.
[00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:20.680]   Oh, he's doing the work for you.
[00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:22.480]   Look at that.
[00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:23.640]   Galaxy S2.
[00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:25.320]   That's not going to be worth much.
[00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:26.320]   60 bucks.
[00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:27.320]   10 dollars.
[00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:28.320]   10 dollars more than that.
[00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:29.320]   Let's see.
[00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:30.320]   Go ahead.
[00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:31.320]   $65.
[00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:32.320]   You've been doing this all?
[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:33.320]   Yes.
[00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:36.400]   So here's the deal I want you to try at go to gazelle.com.
[00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:39.000]   Go through that drawer, that messy drawer every geek has.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.800]   In some cases, it's larger than a drawer.
[00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:45.480]   In some cases, it's a closet, filing cabin.
[00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:47.040]   Small rental unit.
[00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:48.640]   Get that stuff.
[00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:49.640]   Sell it.
[00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:50.640]   Get cash fast.
[00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:51.640]   You can get a check.
[00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:52.640]   PayPal credit.
[00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:56.480]   Best thing though, if you use Amazon, get the Amazon gift card that bumps it up another
[00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:57.840]   5%.
[00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:01.720]   Find out why more than half a million people have used gazelle to make more than a hundred
[00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:02.720]   million dollars.
[00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:05.120]   That's how much they've paid out.
[00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:12.120]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E, don't bother trying to dust it every three months.
[00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:13.120]   Gazelle it.
[00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:17.360]   I was trying to make a noise like Gazelle, but I have no idea what I could say.
[00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:18.360]   What do you buy it on?
[00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:19.360]   I just check.
[00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:20.360]   You said Amazon.
[00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:21.360]   That's not a good deal.
[00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:22.360]   No, it's not a good deal.
[00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:23.360]   I didn't say I was going to buy it, but what happened was is that I have a tendency to
[00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:26.400]   look at Woot and then you said Amazon, Amazon of course owns Woot and then my head went
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:29.400]   to Woot and then I turned Woot on and I went to suit what was Wooty.
[00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:30.400]   We should do this.
[00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:32.480]   I wish Woot would give us money to do this.
[00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:33.960]   Let's do our Woot check-in of the day.
[00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:34.960]   Wouldn't that be a great thing?
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:35.960]   There should be like review of Wooty.
[00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:36.960]   This is a crappy deal though.
[00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:38.960]   I don't understand why anybody would buy this.
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:41.960]   My kids did $99 for an A.V. receiver.
[00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:42.960]   I have this one.
[00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:47.280]   On the other hand, the men's ninja shoe looks pretty cool.
[00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:48.960]   Men's ninja shoe, even the name.
[00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:52.320]   You never know that we were wearing them until it's too late.
[00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:53.320]   How do I find men's ninja shoes?
[00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:54.800]   It's further down on the side.
[00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:55.800]   You can't just look at the main screen.
[00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:56.800]   You can't see the other invisible.
[00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:57.800]   You have to be invisible.
[00:30:57.800 --> 00:31:00.200]   The proper Wooty requires a little sorting through.
[00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:01.200]   The only woman black though.
[00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:02.200]   Oh, sport Woot.
[00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:06.800]   Ooh, those look kind of nice.
[00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:07.800]   Tech tabbies.
[00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:10.200]   If you wear these into the studio.
[00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:14.360]   Well, not the dumbest footwear I've seen this summer.
[00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:16.040]   Well, it's better than the ones with toes.
[00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:17.040]   I have my vibrators.
[00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:18.520]   It does have a disclaimer.
[00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:23.080]   Do not use these to conduct covert assassinations at sabotage against rival prefectures.
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:24.280]   Well, you know why you don't?
[00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:25.760]   Because you've read on the bottom.
[00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:27.760]   You can't tell you read or when you run away.
[00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:28.760]   You would night.
[00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:30.480]   Oh, wait, but they do have a cleft toe though.
[00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:32.080]   Is that so you can wear a sandal?
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:33.080]   Yeah.
[00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:36.000]   No, see, that's why I don't need to wear a sandal.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.720]   No, it's already wearing shoes.
[00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:38.720]   It's not so you can wear a sandal.
[00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:41.480]   So you can get you can put the rope between the toes.
[00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:42.960]   Oh, for the rope.
[00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:46.360]   That's why these are so cheap because you'll be walking around with them.
[00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:49.440]   And then he gets shot in the back of the head by a hunter who thought he was tracking
[00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:50.440]   a doe.
[00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:52.440]   I know it's 802.11 AC.
[00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:57.240]   I'm not going to buy any 802.11 AC shoes anymore.
[00:31:57.240 --> 00:32:01.360]   You're going all the way to 802.11 D. Yes.
[00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:02.360]   Probably.
[00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:03.360]   Here's the problem.
[00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:04.360]   They have two sizes.
[00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:05.360]   Yeah, it's not going to work.
[00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:08.840]   Men's size five or six because we got here too late.
[00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:10.480]   That's for children's big feet.
[00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:13.000]   I have small feet and even I can't fit in those.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.920]   It was a result of poor wooting.
[00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:15.920]   Poor wooting.
[00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:16.920]   I don't know.
[00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:17.920]   See, you know, before it just depends on what color you have.
[00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:19.400]   Oh, is it the color of the problem?
[00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:20.400]   Oh, no, maybe not.
[00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:22.240]   I don't think they were making any issues.
[00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:23.400]   It was all available.
[00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:25.560]   The first time I collected and the second time I collected was gone.
[00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:26.560]   Well, you know what?
[00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:27.560]   I don't know.
[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:29.920]   We just said a million newtors.
[00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:31.920]   I know.
[00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:35.560]   I'm telling you, you should advertise.
[00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:37.000]   Well, they have--
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   Woot has wine.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   I'm not sure I'd buy Woot wine.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   No.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.480]   Is it actually--
[00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:43.480]   Brained like a good example of--
[00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:44.480]   No, actually, it's from a good winery.
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:45.480]   It's a winery around here.
[00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:46.480]   Guys are peak.
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:47.480]   It's actually a very good winery.
[00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:48.480]   Hey, man.
[00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:49.480]   A cheap buzz is a cheap buzz.
[00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:51.320]   Don't put on airs.
[00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:52.320]   It sold out.
[00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:53.320]   $35 for a bottle of wine.
[00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:56.120]   I don't know if that's a cheap buzz.
[00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:57.120]   No rib grilling kit.
[00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:58.960]   I could use that with my big green eggs.
[00:32:58.960 --> 00:32:59.960]   See?
[00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:00.960]   Ruining all my picks of the week.
[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:03.000]   Oh, never mind.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   Forget we mentioned it.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.960]   Look at a little sharp portable air conditioner.
[00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:06.960]   Moving on.
[00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:07.960]   Tim Cook.
[00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:08.960]   You're a good bird.
[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:15.320]   You had a special super secret top double secret event at the Fort Mason Center, which
[00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:16.920]   is in San Francisco but it's a place.
[00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:19.080]   Evidently, it's not as secret as we wanted it to be.
[00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:20.920]   Well, you know, if you bring retail--
[00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:25.360]   Apple retail store leaders from around the world to San Francisco, you fly them in from
[00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:28.400]   all over the world and then you get together with them.
[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:31.480]   Inevitably, one or two of them are not going to understand the rules and talk to the press
[00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:32.480]   the next.
[00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:34.960]   Well, if you put up a giant tent, it's kind of noticeable to it.
[00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:36.760]   The tent kind of was a giveaway.
[00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:38.000]   He talked three hours.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   It's a special man.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   It says hours.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.800]   I guess when your employees, he can say, "You sit there and you listen.
[00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:44.800]   You're not moving."
[00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:45.800]   But see, here's the thing.
[00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:50.440]   Sunday, we had two guys from Apple.
[00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:52.480]   We had a guy from Geneva, a guy from Sydney.
[00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:54.720]   These were all Apple store guys.
[00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:57.440]   Two guys from Toronto and two guys from London.
[00:33:57.440 --> 00:33:59.760]   And they were all Apple store.
[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:00.920]   And I said, "Were you here for the event?"
[00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:01.920]   And they just--
[00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:04.600]   They didn't say anything.
[00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:05.600]   Coincidence.
[00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:07.640]   Yeah, we just happened to be in town.
[00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:13.240]   And we didn't have anything to do on a Saturday, so we just happened to come up here.
[00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:14.240]   So what are these--
[00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:18.720]   Were they wearing suspiciously long sleeve shirts in the hot weather?
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:19.720]   To hide the tattoos?
[00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:22.280]   No, so you couldn't see what they were wearing.
[00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:25.280]   Let's say the wrist, wrist sort of forearm-ish.
[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:27.040]   You know, one of my check-ups.
[00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:28.520]   I have a callers though to prevent talking.
[00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:29.520]   You should have checked them for more.
[00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:30.520]   You should have asked them what time it was.
[00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:31.520]   Oh, damn.
[00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:33.520]   What was I thinking?
[00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:36.600]   I get the metal detector wand out just so you can--
[00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:42.280]   I'm sorry, you agree to have to go through a little strip search.
[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:44.560]   You don't mind a cavity search, do you?
[00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:45.560]   It's a new Twit policy.
[00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:46.560]   It's a new Twit policy.
[00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:49.720]   It was on page four of the 18 page waiver you signed.
[00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:50.720]   We need to search you for--
[00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:52.720]   I'm not going to get retailed on other devices.
[00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:53.720]   It's a federal thing.
[00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:54.720]   No, no, no.
[00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:57.560]   But, well, here's what's kind of interesting.
[00:34:57.560 --> 00:35:03.160]   Cook said in the three hours that Max and iPads are selling quite well, so let's put
[00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:07.280]   them on the back burner.
[00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:11.000]   One out of every four Max sold across the globe or bought from Apple retail stores.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:16.320]   Cook was happy about that, but he said 80% of all iPhones are purchased elsewhere.
[00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:18.240]   We want to change that.
[00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:20.480]   So stop pushing the Max.
[00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:21.480]   Stop pushing the iPad.
[00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:23.640]   Somebody comes in and says, "I'm looking to buy an iMac."
[00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:25.280]   You say, "But how about this fine phone?"
[00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:29.920]   Well, so what got me about that is where is everybody-- are they buying-- everybody
[00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:30.920]   buying computers?
[00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:31.920]   I think they're going to AT&T.
[00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:34.120]   Well, I think they're going to Verizon.
[00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:35.120]   I would guess that's the case.
[00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:40.760]   So I can tell you what my wife was trying to get a new iPhone because she's got this
[00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:41.960]   four and it's slow.
[00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:44.760]   I keep telling her she's got a new one.
[00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:45.760]   You don't want to sell to these.
[00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:48.040]   No, no, she goes to the five.
[00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:52.280]   She goes to the Apple store and then because she's part of the family plan, now she has
[00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:54.400]   to go to the AT&T store.
[00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:56.240]   Apple was sending her to the AT&T store.
[00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:59.360]   The AT&T store is-- it was all this back and forth.
[00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:01.880]   She ended up-- she still has a iPhone 4.
[00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:03.680]   So that's a bummer.
[00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:06.760]   And I just told her, just buy a Verizon phone and then you don't have to do anything.
[00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:11.080]   So if you already have something, if you already have a subscription, there are cases where
[00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:14.760]   it's actually easier to just go to the AT&T store or the Verizon store than it is to go
[00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:18.000]   to the Apple store, that's what Apple has to fix if they want people to buy them because
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.760]   I prefer-- I always buy everything at the Apple store and the reason is because I don't want
[00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:25.560]   to deal with having to fill out some stupid paper for my Apple care.
[00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:28.680]   If I buy at the Apple store, it's just automatic.
[00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:32.040]   You know, I just say, I just want Apple care and then it's attached to my account and it's
[00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:33.040]   all done.
[00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:35.920]   If I do it at the AT&T store, I got to remember to send something in, which I never do, and
[00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:37.880]   then I don't have it.
[00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:40.160]   There's also an Apple retailer that I think is one.
[00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:42.000]   But it's nothing compared to carrier footprints.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:45.080]   There's carrier stores everywhere and people who don't want to drive an hour or two hours
[00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:48.720]   or three hours or just don't have an Apple store in their area probably have three, four
[00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:53.800]   AT&T stores, Verizon stores, Sprint stores within driving distance.
[00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:58.320]   That's so much more convenient for people to go there and Apple, unless they expand greatly,
[00:36:58.320 --> 00:36:59.800]   is never going to compete with that.
[00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:03.000]   Well, the internationally especially, right, because there's Apple's got presents in what
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.400]   you know, maybe a dozen, two dozen countries, but like there's tons of countries out there
[00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:09.160]   where there is an iPhone, but it's all done through the carriers.
[00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:10.840]   There is no Apple store too.
[00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:13.240]   So that's a lot harder for them to get into the channel there.
[00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:16.400]   And there are a lot more other stores than there are Apple stores.
[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:20.920]   He does point out though that when people, when their phones break, half of them go back
[00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:23.960]   to the Apple store for repair or troubleshooting or replacement.
[00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:27.280]   You definitely don't want to go to AT&T to have them come and look at it.
[00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:28.280]   Right.
[00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:30.720]   So, but that's not a good, you know, ratio.
[00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:34.480]   80% are bought some, you know, 20% are bought at the Apple store, but 50% are repaired by
[00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:35.480]   the Apple store.
[00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:39.560]   He says he wants to get those numbers more in line.
[00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:43.840]   So he's developing incentives for both customers buying iPhones and the Apple store selling the
[00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:45.560]   phones.
[00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:50.440]   Apple's apparently back to school promotion is one of the first elements in this with
[00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:54.520]   a $50 gift card if you are a student purchasing an iPhone.
[00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:55.520]   That's incentive, right?
[00:37:55.520 --> 00:38:03.000]   And they do have, they're doing that $100 credit for people buying a Mac, I think.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.800]   The according to this story, it's a nine to five Mac, although they're using an image
[00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:06.800]   from you, Renee.
[00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:07.800]   Were you down there?
[00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:11.120]   There's a guy who was sitting there looking at Apple, build a tent and tweeting the image
[00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:12.120]   after image.
[00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:15.600]   So, Mark is very, Mark's nine to five Mac did the reporting and he's very classy.
[00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:18.040]   So he acknowledged that I was tweeting them in my general direction.
[00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:19.040]   That's nice.
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:23.000]   He gave you both credit, Noble Brown and I don't see a tent here though.
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:27.360]   There if you, if you click through Noble Brown's timeline, maybe like three or four tweets
[00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:29.960]   down, you'll see a whole ton of different pictures.
[00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:31.520]   Cool, cool.
[00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:33.560]   Noble knew who to tweet.
[00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:35.400]   Yeah.
[00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:37.400]   So I missed Tim Cook walking on.
[00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:38.400]   That's Noble.
[00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:39.400]   He's tweeting you.
[00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:40.400]   That's pretty funny.
[00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:41.400]   Yeah.
[00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:43.080]   Let's, let's look through these.
[00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:44.560]   I want to see the tent.
[00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:47.280]   Oh, look at the buses.
[00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:48.440]   They busted these guys in.
[00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:49.920]   This is a nice place actually.
[00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:50.920]   Oh, there's the tent.
[00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:53.760]   This is a nice place to have an event for Mason Center.
[00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:55.080]   A lot of events there.
[00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:56.080]   It's huge.
[00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:57.080]   The tent.
[00:38:57.080 --> 00:38:58.080]   Yeah, it's huge.
[00:38:58.080 --> 00:38:59.080]   It's a little run there.
[00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:00.080]   It's a little run there.
[00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:01.080]   It's a little run there.
[00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:02.080]   It's a farmer's market there.
[00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:03.080]   What happened to have gone to at some point?
[00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:04.080]   Yeah, there's a music.
[00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:05.080]   My kids went to music school.
[00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:06.080]   Really?
[00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:07.080]   Yeah.
[00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:08.080]   There's a blue bear music there.
[00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:09.080]   It was really great.
[00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:10.080]   There's the Golden Gate Bridge in the distance.
[00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:11.080]   That's that's that's pretty picture.
[00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:13.360]   You can kind of see where it is right in the bay.
[00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:15.400]   It's an old army.
[00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:18.080]   And there's Noble shoes.
[00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:20.120]   Not ninja shoes.
[00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:21.120]   Apparently not.
[00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:22.120]   Purple though.
[00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:23.120]   This is a vine.
[00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:25.600]   So it's just going to go again and again and again and again.
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:26.600]   All right.
[00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:29.640]   Anyway, back to the story.
[00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:36.520]   They also what else did he Tim say?
[00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:41.200]   Oh, and now this is a quote from one attendee.
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:44.520]   But it's the quote that it's kind of the quote everybody kind of mentions.
[00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:52.480]   And I think it's that Apple is going to launch quote an army of new products this fall.
[00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:54.040]   That's a literal army by the way.
[00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:55.040]   Yeah, an army.
[00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:56.040]   They're actually.
[00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:57.040]   Yeah.
[00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:58.040]   They're like minions.
[00:39:58.040 --> 00:39:59.040]   They're like minions.
[00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:00.040]   It was a Italian.
[00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:04.040]   It's like that World War two map where Apple slowly encroaches.
[00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:05.960]   It's basically risk.
[00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:10.160]   Yeah, they're going to take the camp check up peninsula and it's all over from there.
[00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:11.560]   We must have a Microsoft.
[00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:18.560]   Yeah, I'll use it in the world and drop Google and a pinch has movement.
[00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:22.960]   What do you guys think about the low cost iPhone rumor in multiple multiple colors?
[00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:25.160]   We keep seeing that pictures of backs and stuff.
[00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:26.680]   I think it makes sense.
[00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:27.680]   It makes sense.
[00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:29.360]   It's the same.
[00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:33.480]   We forget about how how much how expensive these things cost when they're not as heavily
[00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:35.640]   subsidized as they are in the US market.
[00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:40.440]   It's been also how many how many sales Apple loses overseas simply by virtue of the fact
[00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:45.600]   that an Android phone that's running Android 2.3 costs next to nothing compared to.
[00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:50.560]   I mean, people would much rather people would much rather have the extra equivalent of $150
[00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:55.440]   in their pocket than have whatever they have the the the large advantages of an Apple piece
[00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:56.960]   of a product in a pocket.
[00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:58.920]   It also fixes several big problems for Apple.
[00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:01.840]   I mean, as far as I know, they've had this in the lab for years, but they've always chosen
[00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:03.760]   to keep last year's model at a lower price.
[00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:07.760]   But when you start putting an iPhone 5 at a lower price and this started happening already
[00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:12.040]   with the 4s and the 4, that's a hugely attractive phone and exactly what Andy said.
[00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:14.400]   People would rather save money upfront than over the long term.
[00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:18.200]   So it actually reduces the amount of people who'll consider the higher end model at the
[00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:22.120]   same time as higher end phones are reaching saturation according to some market observers
[00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:25.840]   and you have the emerging markets where they don't have the subsidy program.
[00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:29.400]   So the lower cost and it's not people call it a cheap iPhone or budget.
[00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:34.520]   It's it's lower cost the way that a Mac mini is to a Mac Pro or an iPad mini is to an iPad.
[00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:35.520]   It's nothing cheap about it.
[00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:40.240]   It's just lower cost of entry and that solves all those problems rather neatly for Apple.
[00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:41.240]   So it seems almost.
[00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:44.000]   And if it's and if it's plastic on the back, I'd be tempted to get it.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.400]   So it doesn't break that drop.
[00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:46.400]   Yeah.
[00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:47.400]   And better wireless.
[00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:52.040]   I didn't say that I did an inadvertent drop test over the weekend.
[00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:53.760]   At the same time when I was I was taking those pictures.
[00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:57.760]   I had a pouch on my pouch clip to my bag.
[00:41:57.760 --> 00:41:59.240]   So you're a couch.
[00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:00.240]   Exactly.
[00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:03.240]   It had five different phones in it because I was doing side by side by side by side by
[00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:04.680]   side camera test.
[00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:07.520]   And then at the end of the day, I was I was hot too.
[00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:11.040]   And I'm like, I'm just like bending down to pick something up and scoop all five, like
[00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:12.440]   just fell to the ground.
[00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:16.680]   I will say that there were five phones, three of which had plastic bodies, two of which
[00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:17.680]   had metal bodies.
[00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:22.040]   And as always happens whenever I accidentally drop a phone, it was the metal bodied phone
[00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:23.600]   whose screen broke and the rest of the.
[00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:24.600]   Exactly.
[00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:25.600]   Wow.
[00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:26.600]   I've dropped.
[00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:28.800]   I've dropped plenty of phones always by accident.
[00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:29.800]   Some of them mind.
[00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:30.800]   Some of them not mind.
[00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:34.440]   The only time I've ever broken a phone is when the case was metal.
[00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:37.240]   That's only an anecdotal piece of evidence.
[00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:42.480]   But science after after after so many years is like maybe that's not just coincidence.
[00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:46.400]   What would your theory be that the metal is?
[00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:51.680]   I mean, it's it makes some sense to that it would transmit more more of the shock to
[00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:56.440]   the it would transmit shocks instead of instead of absorbing it.
[00:42:56.440 --> 00:43:01.440]   I have I have so many plastic bodied phones where I will see that actually it actually
[00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:03.760]   landed right on the corner.
[00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:06.520]   And all it did was just sort of scuff the corner and that was it.
[00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:07.520]   The glass was fine.
[00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:08.520]   Everything else was fine.
[00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:10.040]   The metal is malleable, right?
[00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:14.320]   The metal will dent in Ben, whereas plastic will either shatter or not shatter most of
[00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:15.320]   the time.
[00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:18.280]   I mean, I have my iPhone five has a nice little divot on the bottom of it where I dropped it
[00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:19.280]   now.
[00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:20.280]   So yeah, that's it's.
[00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:24.200]   Yeah, that's that's where all the damages on my iPhone five is on the bezel on the metal,
[00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:29.400]   the aluminum bezel and Apple Apple has made plastic phones before the 3G and the 3GS were
[00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:33.200]   both plastic phones and the other tendency when they introduce a higher end product to
[00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:37.140]   have the lower end ones be color like the iPod touches went color when the iPad mini
[00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:38.140]   was introduced.
[00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:41.680]   So color makes I don't know if it'll be iPhone seven palette color, but colors make a lot
[00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:42.680]   of sense.
[00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:46.760]   But that's but it's I think it's styling is like not as important as anyone makes it out
[00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:51.160]   to be because again, every I'm on the guy on the subway who's always looking at what
[00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:54.040]   other the other kind of devices other people are using.
[00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:58.320]   And the times where I see any kind of a phone that is not inside an eight dollar third party
[00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:00.760]   case is so rare.
[00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:06.360]   So if there is exactly I mean, it's like the iPhone five is one of the most beautiful
[00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:07.460]   phones ever made.
[00:44:07.460 --> 00:44:11.120]   But again, it's beautiful for about eight days until they get that box from Amazon with
[00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:15.080]   that, you know, $12 silicon Hello, Kelly Hello Kitty slip case.
[00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:19.200]   And then you had really ugly phones like the galaxy S four, which you're very happy to
[00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:20.920]   put in the case.
[00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:24.560]   And I you know, but at that point now, because of this case, it doesn't it not only is it
[00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:29.280]   going to be really robust, this is a spike in a lot of them arm a lot of case, a lot of
[00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:30.280]   case.
[00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:34.040]   And it has a little people boo, which I really like there.
[00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:35.880]   There are pluses there, pluses and minuses.
[00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:39.880]   This is why I disagree with people who will always dismiss a plastic body.
[00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:43.760]   The nice thing about like the S three and the S four is that yes, it has a plastic back,
[00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:47.800]   but the idea is that you can easily snap that off so you can replace a battery, swap out
[00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:52.960]   a memory card, or just replace essentially there isn't it nice to have a phone where
[00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:57.720]   you don't have to simply slip the phone inside a case, you can actually buy a case that will
[00:44:57.720 --> 00:44:59.880]   become essentially part of that phone's housing.
[00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:03.880]   Yeah, so I don't I don't think this is necessarily a positive or negative to plastic, but there
[00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:08.000]   are positives as well as I kind of dig the color idea to I mean, I one of my colleagues
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:12.160]   got his iPhone five anodized, you know, that's so cool.
[00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:15.440]   And so it's kind of you think like, well, hey, that's kind of nifty looking.
[00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:18.920]   And for me, there's a question of trade offs in terms of if we've got a lower cost iPhone
[00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:22.600]   that does have that slick sort of styling, what are the trade offs going to be that aren't
[00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:26.120]   just going to convince people to flock to this cheaper phone, especially if it's got like,
[00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:27.680]   Oh, I can pick what color I want.
[00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:30.640]   Like I think there's there's a lot of attraction there.
[00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:34.840]   And I don't know what the trade offs will be in terms of like the full cost versus the
[00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:38.040]   low cost phone that it's going to move people in one direction or the other.
[00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:40.520]   I think we can also say that we're kind of at the same stage.
[00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:46.440]   Well, we're much later, but we're it's similar or analogous to what happened to the iPod
[00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:51.280]   right where they where they they started to fill in the gaps of low cost iPods color
[00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:52.280]   iPod.
[00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:54.800]   I think in the history, I mean, Apple's history has been not wanting to leave a lot of oxygen
[00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:55.800]   in the space.
[00:45:55.800 --> 00:46:00.560]   And so once they get once they, you know, definitely with the iPod, they they started
[00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:05.640]   with something very high end, but we ended up with something from $50 to, you know, to
[00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:11.120]   600 or 500 or whatever, they had something that every step all the way up and it definitely
[00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:14.720]   seems like that's something that's missing in the iPhone and iPad market.
[00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:15.720]   Right.
[00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:16.720]   Yeah.
[00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:17.720]   And also the plastics.
[00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:20.360]   I mean, the polycarbonate if people get angry when I call a plastic, but polycarbonate
[00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:21.360]   varies.
[00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:22.360]   Nokia makes really nice.
[00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:25.520]   Who gets angry when you call the internet Leo, the internet.
[00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:26.520]   I was pretty upset.
[00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:27.520]   I'm sorry.
[00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:28.520]   That's not plastic.
[00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:29.520]   That's polycarbonate.
[00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:30.520]   Yes.
[00:46:30.520 --> 00:46:33.120]   But I mean, like the blackberries at 10 in black feels great in white.
[00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:34.120]   The plastic feels very different.
[00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:35.120]   I don't like it as much.
[00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:39.000]   And I found that with a lot of phones that the color and the manufacturer of the plastic
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:40.440]   really varies the quality.
[00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:42.040]   White tends to be slick.
[00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:43.040]   Yeah.
[00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:44.040]   I don't know why.
[00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:46.880]   I don't know if it's something to do with the color or what, but they tend to be slick
[00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:48.980]   and slippery.
[00:46:48.980 --> 00:46:50.880]   And I guess you could do more textures and other colors.
[00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:55.960]   In fact, I'm even looking at these pictures from tactis.com of the reputed iPhone and
[00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:58.320]   the white one looks really slippery.
[00:46:58.320 --> 00:46:59.320]   You can just see it.
[00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:00.960]   There's the black iPhone 3GS.
[00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:02.360]   We're pretty similar.
[00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:03.360]   Yeah.
[00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:05.560]   I think it's just that it looks like a bar of ivory soap.
[00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:07.560]   That's what's kind of getting it.
[00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:08.560]   100% pure.
[00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:10.560]   99 and 44, 100% pure.
[00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:13.880]   These look like the semi-transparent one.
[00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:15.880]   Yeah, these really look like blue one.
[00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:16.880]   I would.
[00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:19.720]   The bottom blue is very, very I'm back.
[00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:20.720]   Yeah.
[00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:22.360]   I got yelled at last week from mispronouncing Bondi.
[00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:23.360]   And I don't know how to pronounce it.
[00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:24.360]   It's dull.
[00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:25.360]   So I'm going to get yelled at a lot, Renee.
[00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:26.360]   I'm noticing that.
[00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:27.360]   People are very angry.
[00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:28.360]   No, don't use Twitter.
[00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:29.880]   That's the place where yellers go.
[00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:34.640]   In fact, all the celebrities are leaving Twitter now because there was so much negativity.
[00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:35.640]   A lot of haters.
[00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:36.640]   A lot of hate.
[00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:37.640]   Hate does.
[00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:38.640]   Hate does.
[00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:39.640]   Bondi.
[00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:40.640]   How is it pronounced?
[00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:41.640]   Bondi.
[00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:42.640]   Bondi?
[00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:43.640]   Really?
[00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:45.320]   I thought that was the Japanese electronic guy.
[00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:46.320]   Bondi.
[00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:50.280]   We always have, we have so many Australians in here and I never ask them.
[00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:51.280]   I should ask them.
[00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:53.040]   How do you say it?
[00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:54.040]   Bondi?
[00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:58.600]   The right answer is you ask an American how to pronounce it and that answer is the correct
[00:47:58.600 --> 00:47:59.600]   one.
[00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:00.600]   Bondi.
[00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:02.600]   Ask an American.
[00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:05.880]   Yeah, that's always the right answer.
[00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:07.880]   I was just trolling for conversation.
[00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:10.240]   One of the best CBC shows ever, Andy.
[00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:12.000]   Ask an American.
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:22.800]   Apparently, we have no Australians in the chat room and an unheralded, unprecedented.
[00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:25.120]   Nobody, Bondi says psych four.
[00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:26.120]   Bondi.
[00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:29.480]   Do we want a Bondi iPhone?
[00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:32.200]   I want a retro for me.
[00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:33.200]   Bondi beach.
[00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:37.240]   Now, if you talk blue dalmatian and flower power, then I'm in.
[00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:41.120]   Hey, they are made in California now or no, not made, but the same.
[00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:42.120]   It's the same.
[00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:43.120]   It's assembled.
[00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:47.960]   They bleed in six colors.
[00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:48.960]   Let's take a break.
[00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:53.960]   We got some news about the Haswell MacBook Pro.
[00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:56.400]   But first a word from legalzoom.com.
[00:48:56.400 --> 00:49:00.680]   You don't have to go to a lawyer for a lot of the legal documents you need to prepare
[00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:01.680]   in life.
[00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:03.320]   In fact, to be mistaken to go to a lawyer.
[00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:09.360]   When I created Twitter, I created an LLC online, easily go through questionair@legalzoom.com
[00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:10.360]   and guess what?
[00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:12.600]   It cost me 99 bucks.
[00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:14.600]   That's a good deal.
[00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:18.280]   You can do a chapter S or a chapter C Corp for 99 bucks.
[00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:20.680]   Trademark 169 bucks.
[00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:23.280]   Last will in testament, if you don't have one, boy, you got to get one.
[00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:26.240]   If you've got kids, you don't want the courts deciding where they go.
[00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:27.240]   It's $69.
[00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:29.160]   You could say where your kids go, what happens?
[00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:31.360]   And even if you decide that you're going to do it, at some point you're going to go to
[00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:33.200]   a lawyer, just get something in place.
[00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:35.320]   That's the big thing is that for $69 you can have a six.
[00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:36.320]   Well, exactly.
[00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:37.320]   Because I think when you're going to get around to it.
[00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:38.320]   I'll go to a lawyer.
[00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:39.320]   I'll go to a lawyer.
[00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:40.320]   You never do.
[00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:41.320]   Just do this.
[00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:42.320]   You can literally do it tonight.
[00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:43.920]   You get home from work, do it.
[00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:44.920]   It'll be done.
[00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:46.160]   You'll be happy.
[00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:48.280]   And by the way, this is something new at LegalZoom and I love it.
[00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:53.520]   They do have legal plans at fixed rates for low monthly fee.
[00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:57.560]   You can speak to an attorney licensed in your state, almost every state now.
[00:49:57.560 --> 00:50:00.480]   They have reviews of the attorney's profile of the attorney's unedited reviews so you
[00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:03.560]   can see which attorneys fit your needs.
[00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:04.560]   That's great too.
[00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:05.560]   That's a real piece of mind.
[00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:06.560]   Very inexpensive.
[00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:09.360]   Personal legal plan attorney $11.99 a month.
[00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:11.160]   That's a great deal.
[00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:12.720]   LegalZoom.com.
[00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:19.560]   As a thank you for mentioning Mac Break, if you use the offer code MBW on checkout, MBW

[00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:36.320]   If you look at LegalZoom.com at all, if you're doing a nonprofit, if you want to do a DBA,
[00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:38.760]   get a tax ID.
[00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:40.480]   It's just a ton of stuff.
[00:50:40.480 --> 00:50:44.120]   Trademark registration might be something you'd want to look at if you've got a brand.
[00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:45.120]   What's your name of your blog?
[00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:46.120]   Is it something you want to protect?
[00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:50.640]   You don't want somebody to create a competing blog with the same name that protects you.
[00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:53.200]   All sorts of business compliance and business services.
[00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:59.720]   It's very important, especially if you have a popular podcasting organization that has
[00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:00.720]   a similar name.
[00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:02.640]   We trademarked Twits so quickly.
[00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:03.640]   They still...
[00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:07.840]   Well, this weekend I couldn't trademark because it was owned.
[00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:08.840]   How about this?
[00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:10.760]   What happens to your pets if you pass?
[00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:11.760]   Do you ever think of that?
[00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:13.120]   It's not a lot of that.
[00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:17.720]   Pet protection agreement, $39, a personalized agreement that covers all current and future
[00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:21.960]   pets, community of care provisions to preserve your pets well, being ability to provide
[00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:23.880]   instructions for pets, wants, and needs.
[00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:24.880]   I think this is...
[00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:25.880]   There's a lot of people say, "Oh, I don't have kids.
[00:51:25.880 --> 00:51:26.880]   I don't have to worry."
[00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:27.880]   What about pets?
[00:51:27.880 --> 00:51:28.880]   What happens to your pets?
[00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:29.880]   I've got a plant.
[00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:31.880]   I don't think they have plant protection, but I should...
[00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:32.880]   That's all right.
[00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:33.880]   That plant is no way to...
[00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:34.880]   So specious.
[00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:35.880]   Put it out into the sun.
[00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:37.040]   You can have a pet guardian.
[00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:38.280]   You can leave funds for your pet.
[00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:41.120]   I mean, this is not insignificant.
[00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:42.920]   A lot of people don't think about this.
[00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:46.600]   And you know, Chad, you're a young guy, but you could pass at any time.
[00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:47.600]   I know.
[00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:48.600]   But think about it.
[00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:49.600]   What happens to your kitties?
[00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:52.200]   You have a brother or sister?
[00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:54.400]   Somebody's going to come from Austin and get them.
[00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:56.560]   Well, I mean, if it was up to the government, it'd probably be...
[00:51:56.560 --> 00:51:58.920]   The government doesn't rule a pet.
[00:51:58.920 --> 00:51:59.920]   I don't know.
[00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:02.680]   They might send them to a tek-tomp or something.
[00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:07.360]   Next time the docket, what happens to cuddles and...
[00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:09.760]   It really depends on what kind of pet.
[00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:11.320]   Waffles and what?
[00:52:11.320 --> 00:52:12.320]   Cella.
[00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:14.160]   Like it's celery.
[00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:16.040]   She's named after a singer, Cella Blue.
[00:52:16.040 --> 00:52:17.040]   Cella.
[00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:22.040]   Next on the docket, State of California versus Waffles and Cella.
[00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:23.040]   Cella.
[00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:24.040]   But they would...
[00:52:24.040 --> 00:52:25.040]   They'd go to the pound.
[00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:26.040]   They'd go to the pound.
[00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:27.040]   You know, it's...
[00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:28.040]   They'd exactly what they do.
[00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:29.040]   I would not want that.
[00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:30.040]   A pet protection.
[00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:32.040]   Where are we going to send these weasels?
[00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:33.040]   LegalZoom.com.
[00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:34.040]   Use the offer code.
[00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:40.160]   Hey, if you lose the offer code MBW, it's like 29 bucks to protect your pets.
[00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:42.040]   That's a great deal.
[00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:43.040]   Don't...
[00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:45.040]   Hey, just saying.
[00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:46.040]   LegalZoom.com.
[00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:51.040]   Your pets will thank you.
[00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:56.960]   So, you know, this happens all the time when there's a new device.
[00:52:56.960 --> 00:53:03.320]   People get it to review it or whatever and they go over to Geekbench.
[00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:08.720]   And the thing about Geekbench when you use it, unless you explicitly say don't, it will
[00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:14.240]   upload the results so that there's a database of all the machines with this, you know, processor,
[00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:16.240]   these specs, these are the results.
[00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:23.920]   Wellness, a machine appearing to be a Haswell processor clocked at 2.4 gigahertz is now showing
[00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:25.520]   up at Geekbench.
[00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:28.560]   AAPL J45, one.
[00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:32.800]   It was spotted by Mac Rumors today.
[00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:37.200]   The test machine features 16 gigs of RAM running Mavericks.
[00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:41.680]   10.9 further kind of, you know, supporting this.
[00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:43.320]   Obviously a new Haswell.
[00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:46.600]   I think that's why they didn't release Haswell MacBooks Pros, right?
[00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:48.760]   They were going to, they wanted to do with Mavericks.
[00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:49.760]   Right.
[00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:50.760]   Yeah.
[00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:52.640]   It is not super fast.
[00:53:52.640 --> 00:54:00.720]   It's at a Geekbench score about 12.5 is fairly close to the 15 inch MacBook Pros.
[00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:02.800]   But that's kind of what we saw with the MacBook Airs.
[00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:04.800]   They didn't speed them up.
[00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:06.440]   It's all about battery life now.
[00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:07.440]   And battery life.
[00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:12.560]   And putting the SSD on the PCI bus made a big difference in this, in the air.
[00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:14.480]   It's a huge difference.
[00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:21.520]   The one that the Geekbench saw is an Intel Core i7 4950HQ.
[00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:28.120]   That's a fourth generation Core i7 with Iris 5200 graphics.
[00:54:28.120 --> 00:54:31.920]   That's the premium graphics solution as opposed to the Intel HD, which is also available on
[00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:33.280]   Haswell.
[00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:37.280]   So this was obviously like top of the line and still not much faster.
[00:54:37.280 --> 00:54:38.640]   Which is interesting.
[00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:42.640]   Although one of the things that the Geekbench wouldn't show is like lag as you're going
[00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:44.960]   back and forth in a retina display, things like that.
[00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:45.960]   Right.
[00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:48.880]   Previously it was redlined and hopefully this will let it go comfortably in third gear.
[00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:49.880]   Exactly.
[00:54:49.880 --> 00:54:52.720]   Exactly.
[00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:55.160]   That was a 15 inch.
[00:54:55.160 --> 00:55:01.680]   But apparently there was also a 13 inch in there with an i5 4258U processor clocked at
[00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:03.560]   2.4 gigahertz.
[00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:08.440]   Somewhat lower score about half 7140.
[00:55:08.440 --> 00:55:10.440]   So I don't know if that means there's soon.
[00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:12.320]   You know, it Mavericks is September, right?
[00:55:12.320 --> 00:55:13.320]   I'm pretty sure about that.
[00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:14.320]   I think so.
[00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:15.320]   Well, that's soon.
[00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:17.320]   This is July, July, August, September, two months.
[00:55:17.320 --> 00:55:18.320]   No, probably won't even be an event.
[00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:20.680]   It'll probably be like a little, like, yeah.
[00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:22.320]   People just noticed, what I bought.
[00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:23.680]   Well, remember this is faster.
[00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:25.120]   Army of new products, right?
[00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:26.120]   Right.
[00:55:26.120 --> 00:55:27.640]   So didn't Apple do that in September of last year?
[00:55:27.640 --> 00:55:28.640]   That was an amazing event.
[00:55:28.640 --> 00:55:30.240]   October was iPad and Mac.
[00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:31.640]   They refreshed everything, right?
[00:55:31.640 --> 00:55:35.320]   Yeah, within the span of about a month, because I flew back and forth to San Francisco
[00:55:35.320 --> 00:55:36.320]   a couple of times.
[00:55:36.320 --> 00:55:37.720]   Yeah, it was September, then there was October.
[00:55:37.720 --> 00:55:38.720]   Yeah.
[00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:41.320]   Same thing this year?
[00:55:41.320 --> 00:55:42.320]   I think it seems likely.
[00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:47.840]   I mean, they went so long between then and announcing anything and even when WWC rolled
[00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:51.880]   around, there was very little at WWC that was immediately available, right?
[00:55:51.880 --> 00:55:55.400]   Then the MacBook errors came out, but they talked about the Pro, which doesn't still
[00:55:55.400 --> 00:55:56.400]   come out.
[00:55:56.400 --> 00:55:59.040]   They talked about Mavericks and iOS 7, which are both in the fall.
[00:55:59.040 --> 00:56:02.960]   So that seems to me that they're talking about some stuff in the summer, coming around
[00:56:02.960 --> 00:56:04.120]   to launch it in the fall.
[00:56:04.120 --> 00:56:07.560]   And probably since the software platforms are coming out then, why not launch it along
[00:56:07.560 --> 00:56:08.560]   inside some new hardware?
[00:56:08.560 --> 00:56:09.560]   Right.
[00:56:09.560 --> 00:56:10.560]   And you know where the...
[00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:12.800]   You're going to launch the Pro with a special event, right?
[00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:13.800]   Yeah.
[00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:14.800]   Definitely.
[00:56:14.800 --> 00:56:15.800]   So you might as well approach the Pro.
[00:56:15.800 --> 00:56:16.800]   Yeah, you're the Pro.
[00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:17.800]   And then they go, and...
[00:56:17.800 --> 00:56:19.640]   So you might as well say, and we are also doing Haswell across the line and every one
[00:56:19.640 --> 00:56:23.840]   of our machines, iMacs and the MacBook Pros, we're going to put...
[00:56:23.840 --> 00:56:24.840]   Or Haswells everywhere.
[00:56:24.840 --> 00:56:26.600]   The Pro would be all time to do that.
[00:56:26.600 --> 00:56:31.320]   They're also going to want to bring people up on stage to show the specialized apps that
[00:56:31.320 --> 00:56:35.160]   couldn't really exist or couldn't really perform the way that they do now, if not for something
[00:56:35.160 --> 00:56:37.560]   as specific as the new Mac Pro.
[00:56:37.560 --> 00:56:38.560]   So...
[00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:39.560]   Do you...
[00:56:39.560 --> 00:56:40.560]   That's not going to be quite one.
[00:56:40.560 --> 00:56:41.560]   That's going to be a stage one.
[00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:43.960]   Do you think...
[00:56:43.960 --> 00:56:44.960]   Nickname wants to know.
[00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:49.600]   There will be a 17-inch or is that gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone,
[00:56:49.600 --> 00:56:50.600]   gone, gone.
[00:56:50.600 --> 00:56:54.560]   You'll see a 17-inch iPad before you'll see a 17-inch iPad.
[00:56:54.560 --> 00:56:56.960]   And you'll never see a 17-inch iPad.
[00:56:56.960 --> 00:56:57.960]   I've played with you.
[00:56:57.960 --> 00:56:58.960]   My buck.
[00:56:58.960 --> 00:56:59.960]   Have you played with the...
[00:56:59.960 --> 00:57:00.960]   Lenovo?
[00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:01.960]   Lenovo.
[00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:02.960]   The big Lenovo, like, table tablets.
[00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:03.960]   That's a lot of...
[00:57:03.960 --> 00:57:04.960]   That's a lot of tablets.
[00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:05.960]   Cool idea.
[00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:06.960]   Yeah.
[00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:07.960]   It's a good workout for you.
[00:57:07.960 --> 00:57:10.160]   That upper body strength, though, right?
[00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:12.960]   They have to have special hinges.
[00:57:12.960 --> 00:57:15.960]   But even my 10-inch iPad, you're just like, "Oh, this is..."
[00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:16.960]   I know.
[00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:17.960]   Mini is it now.
[00:57:17.960 --> 00:57:18.960]   Everybody wants...
[00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:19.960]   I think that's the sweet spot.
[00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:20.960]   Oh, no.
[00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:22.960]   I'm sorry, the iPad mini?
[00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:23.960]   Yeah.
[00:57:23.960 --> 00:57:25.560]   Mini is 7-inch is the sweet spot now.
[00:57:25.560 --> 00:57:26.560]   Right.
[00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:28.360]   I thought you were talking about smaller notebooks.
[00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:29.560]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:57:29.560 --> 00:57:31.360]   I don't want a 7-inch notebook.
[00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:33.760]   Oh, no, even like 10-inch and a limited-ish.
[00:57:33.760 --> 00:57:34.760]   No.
[00:57:34.760 --> 00:57:35.760]   You know what?
[00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:36.960]   13-inch only for me now.
[00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:39.960]   I had a 11-inch air and I said no, you know.
[00:57:39.960 --> 00:57:41.360]   The 11-inch air is a little too small.
[00:57:41.360 --> 00:57:42.360]   I love my 11-inch air.
[00:57:42.360 --> 00:57:43.920]   I'm going to be the contrarian.
[00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:44.920]   I love my 11-inch air.
[00:57:44.920 --> 00:57:45.920]   I've been using this for a couple years.
[00:57:45.920 --> 00:57:46.920]   Oh, yeah.
[00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:51.440]   Well, I travel a decent amount and I find it great in the airline seats and that cramped
[00:57:51.440 --> 00:57:52.440]   coach seats.
[00:57:52.440 --> 00:57:54.440]   Who was that on Twitter who had an 11-inch air?
[00:57:54.440 --> 00:57:55.440]   Jason Schnell.
[00:57:55.440 --> 00:57:56.440]   Jason Schnell.
[00:57:56.440 --> 00:57:57.440]   And he's...
[00:57:57.440 --> 00:57:58.600]   Oh, yeah, Jason and I both have...
[00:57:58.600 --> 00:58:00.200]   In every show, he talks about it.
[00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:01.720]   But it was so weird and dinky.
[00:58:01.720 --> 00:58:06.160]   Because I had to see one in a while.
[00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:09.000]   I'm now starting to feel like I'm the old-fashioned person to have a laptop.
[00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:12.240]   So to get back to Rwanda, the entire government is all on iPads.
[00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:13.240]   What?
[00:58:13.240 --> 00:58:16.440]   Like, all the guys pull out their iPads and they're not...
[00:58:16.440 --> 00:58:18.480]   And I was like, "Do you have a laptop?"
[00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:19.480]   He's like, "Oh, no.
[00:58:19.480 --> 00:58:20.480]   Too heavy.
[00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:21.480]   Too big."
[00:58:21.480 --> 00:58:22.480]   I'm watching it.
[00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:24.680]   You know, you know, just watching my favorite new show which came out on Showtime last week,
[00:58:24.680 --> 00:58:25.680]   Ray Donovan.
[00:58:25.680 --> 00:58:26.680]   It's amazing.
[00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:27.680]   I've heard about that.
[00:58:27.680 --> 00:58:28.680]   One highly recommend.
[00:58:28.680 --> 00:58:31.400]   It's entourage meets the fighter.
[00:58:31.400 --> 00:58:33.720]   If you can even imagine what that would mean.
[00:58:33.720 --> 00:58:34.720]   But he says...
[00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:38.240]   The first episode, he says, "Honey, where's my iPad?"
[00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:40.560]   And now this is a big butch macho.
[00:58:40.560 --> 00:58:42.000]   He's got a Boston accent.
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:43.000]   He's tough.
[00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:44.000]   He's a boxer.
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:46.160]   Hey, honey, where's my iPad?
[00:58:46.160 --> 00:58:47.160]   Which shows you're right.
[00:58:47.160 --> 00:58:48.160]   I mean, I would have thought iPad.
[00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:49.160]   Oh, come on.
[00:58:49.160 --> 00:58:50.160]   How a feat.
[00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:51.160]   You know.
[00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:52.160]   But no.
[00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:53.160]   We should try to figure out though.
[00:58:53.160 --> 00:58:54.160]   Like, I'm on record.
[00:58:54.160 --> 00:58:58.400]   It's saying one of the reasons why I don't have an 11-inch era is because I have a 10-inch
[00:58:58.400 --> 00:59:00.200]   iPad and a Bluetooth keyboard.
[00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:04.720]   And to me, that's superior to the air in many ways.
[00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:09.840]   I think that once you start talking to people about what is it about the 11-inch air that
[00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:12.560]   they can do that they can't do on an iPad?
[00:59:12.560 --> 00:59:13.560]   I know.
[00:59:13.560 --> 00:59:18.600]   And what apps would they require Mac OS for that wouldn't work better on 13 inches than
[00:59:18.600 --> 00:59:19.600]   11 inches?
[00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:26.360]   Well, I'm not on 13 and 11, but my big thing, the reason I don't use an air is because the
[00:59:26.360 --> 00:59:30.840]   mail app is designed for low volume.
[00:59:30.840 --> 00:59:32.480]   You know, I mean, you know, a mail.
[00:59:32.480 --> 00:59:34.000]   I mean, I, you know, I lose.
[00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:36.480]   There is so much mail that I do not get on my iPad and on my iPhone.
[00:59:36.480 --> 00:59:38.440]   And when I go to my computer, it's all there.
[00:59:38.440 --> 00:59:39.440]   Use a Gmail app.
[00:59:39.440 --> 00:59:43.240]   Like, I use the Gmail app and you still, well, the I'm apping with Gmail, you, I'll
[00:59:43.240 --> 00:59:47.000]   open it up and I'll see an email from somebody and then it'll disappear.
[00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:48.800]   Like it'll be just there for a minute and then it'll go.
[00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:54.080]   It's like, it's like all, almost all mobile mail apps absolutely stink.
[00:59:54.080 --> 00:59:55.080]   It's shocking.
[00:59:55.080 --> 00:59:56.080]   I agree.
[00:59:56.080 --> 01:00:01.440]   Last time I was in New York is like, I've had the optimism beaten out of me, the expectations
[01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:03.560]   that a mobile mail app is going to work.
[01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:07.720]   It's like, okay, I need, oh, I didn't, I forgot to put into, to put into every note, the address
[01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:10.280]   of the place I'm meeting today.
[01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:12.400]   Like, oh, I'll do a search for the mailbox.
[01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:14.560]   I know exactly the name of the person who sent it to me.
[01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:15.560]   Yeah, it does.
[01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:16.560]   And no, it can't find it.
[01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:18.080]   So yes, I'm going to have to go into Safari.
[01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:23.040]   I'm going to have to run the mail at the web mail client on my web server because it has
[01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:27.120]   a simple box called search on it that will find things for me.
[01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:29.000]   But this is beyond the capabilities of the.
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.000]   Oh, it's constant.
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.400]   What is the best mail app?
[01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:33.400]   Is it Apple's mail?
[01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:35.200]   Oh, I don't know if it's the best.
[01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:36.800]   Nobody is the all terrible.
[01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:37.800]   Exactly.
[01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:38.800]   Nobody.
[01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:39.800]   I think mail is the best of the bad.
[01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:40.800]   Yeah, it's the best.
[01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:44.240]   Well, I've used at least it's bad and pretty as opposed to bad.
[01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:46.880]   If you have multiple accounts, it's one of your only options too, because a lot of the
[01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:49.520]   other ones are Gmail only and you can't get a unified inbox.
[01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:54.520]   I think most people now use the web, unfortunately.
[01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:59.840]   And it's not again, like for another thing, because I used to use there were some really
[01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:05.640]   good mail apps that just did not get updated.
[01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:09.120]   And the problem with all the web stuff is, you know, I'm in South Africa and South African
[01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:16.320]   airlines once again has screwed up my tickets and I need to get my codes and then I have
[01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:17.480]   everything on my hard drive.
[01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:21.080]   You know, like I don't, because I don't have access to the web where I'm standing, you
[01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:23.160]   know, and that's the, you know, and being able to have it all.
[01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:26.560]   And I just, I don't understand why I can't just tell my iPad.
[01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:31.720]   Okay, I'm going to give you 10 gigs, like 10 gigs, just cash everything into my iPad.
[01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:33.440]   Don't, I don't want to do the web services.
[01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:37.040]   You know, and so the thing is, is that I find it very annoying that it says the last thousand
[01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:38.040]   messages.
[01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:39.800]   I get 400 emails a day.
[01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:43.520]   So that's like the last day, you know, two, two and a half days rather than I just want
[01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:46.120]   to give you 10 gigs and then just fill it up and tell me when it's filled up and I'll
[01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:47.320]   give you more.
[01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:50.800]   So I have 86,618.
[01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:54.360]   Is that unread messages in my inbox?
[01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:57.440]   When does it break?
[01:01:57.440 --> 01:01:58.440]   Let us know, Leo.
[01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:01.840]   Maybe it's not that you don't get invited.
[01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:03.360]   These are exclusive events.
[01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:05.080]   Oh, no.
[01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:07.000]   No, but a lot.
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:11.840]   I mean, a lot of them are, and I'm sure this is true of everybody, newsletters I subscribed
[01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:16.880]   to or, you know, I pretty assiduous about unsubscribing to unwanted mail.
[01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:19.920]   I mean, whenever there's an unsubscribe at the bottom, because otherwise I can never
[01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:21.320]   get through my mail.
[01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:25.160]   Nevertheless, a lot of this stuff is PR and stuff like that that I'm just using.
[01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:28.120]   Well, my inbox is just the, is just the stuff that doesn't have a filter.
[01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:31.720]   So it's like the stuff that, you know, no, my inbox is stuff addressed to Leo Laport.
[01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:33.160]   Oh, and mine's not mine.
[01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:34.720]   That's what you should do to Alex Lindsey.
[01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:36.640]   Because then you know it's, it's to you.
[01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:40.560]   But even if it's to me, my big thing is that, um, then I have white list, which is anything
[01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:44.720]   that, that I have in my address book or anybody that I've actually interacted with.
[01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:46.000]   So that goes into the white list.
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.960]   And then if you haven't done that, then you, you know, then there's code.
[01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:55.560]   We need to do a special on how you manage on email because it's broken, broken, broken.
[01:02:55.560 --> 01:03:00.080]   You guys just said what, uh, there, well, how could it be that there is no good email
[01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:01.640]   at the kids aren't using email anymore.
[01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:03.120]   Leo, they're all moving to instant messenger.
[01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:06.680]   We're just going to reduce the volume though.
[01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:10.160]   It seems like if all the kids, you know, they're, we're moving out of that.
[01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:11.160]   Somebody's using it.
[01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:12.160]   Just be curve here, right?
[01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:15.880]   I think the answer is to be friendly to fewer people.
[01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:20.480]   I do admit that I am always behind the kids curve, you know, where I, you know, I see,
[01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:22.520]   my kids will be like, you know, though I don't use email.
[01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:23.720]   I just text and everything else.
[01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:25.840]   And then I find myself now, like someone will email me something.
[01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:27.240]   I'm like, why did they just email me that?
[01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:28.240]   Why was that not a text?
[01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:31.400]   You know, like, like it's just, it's not that wasn't fast enough because email does seem
[01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:32.400]   to be too slow.
[01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:33.400]   Too slow.
[01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:36.320]   It's like problematic.
[01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:39.520]   I would, I would email them, but it'll take too long for them to respond.
[01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:41.720]   If I just text them, I'll get it right back, you know, and I'll do that.
[01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:42.720]   But I, but I live it there.
[01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:43.720]   Yeah.
[01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:44.720]   I agree.
[01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:45.720]   Yeah.
[01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:47.320]   I like that level of triage though.
[01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:51.640]   I like that I've sort of trained the world that, you know, they, the only people who
[01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:55.720]   ever incend messaged me are the people who I really do have that kind of relationship
[01:03:55.720 --> 01:04:00.800]   with where they, they feel as though they know how I would react to any specific piece
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:06.400]   of news or any specific invitation to conversations they're, they're creating on AIM or on G plus
[01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:08.080]   or anything or anything like that.
[01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:11.320]   It would be terrible if this were like, if I could be in the middle of something and then
[01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:15.240]   someone wants not, not only wants to pitch me something, but wants to have a conversation
[01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:17.200]   with me about, oh, I'm sorry.
[01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:18.200]   It's a bad time.
[01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:19.600]   Would you like me to try again later?
[01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:20.600]   No.
[01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:22.640]   Oh, is this the sort of pitch you be interested in?
[01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:23.640]   No.
[01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:25.200]   Oh, what kind of pitches would you be interested in?
[01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:27.560]   If this were email, I would simply do nothing.
[01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:31.280]   And then if you emailed me again later, I would say, Oh, I'll hit command option, whatever.
[01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:32.280]   And thank you for that.
[01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:34.680]   I mean, that thing was really interesting, but I don't think it's really bad.
[01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:38.280]   I'll be in touch later if anyone information can find you not to, right?
[01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:41.280]   Well, and do you find that when you do a lot of time?
[01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:43.000]   I'm texting it changes the way you email it.
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:46.200]   Like for everyone in the company knows, my company knows that if you send me an email
[01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:49.720]   longer than six lines, the chance of me reading it is almost zero.
[01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:52.160]   And I mean, like literally I just see a big email and I don't even look at it.
[01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:53.160]   I just, OK, I'll get that later.
[01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:57.920]   Do you guys think that, I mean, all the development now is going into mobile apps, mailbox?
[01:04:57.920 --> 01:04:59.400]   For your eyes.
[01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:01.440]   So are those better?
[01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:02.440]   I mean, is nothing's better.
[01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:04.000]   Nothing's better until I can cash it.
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:07.320]   Until I can cash it, until I can cash everything on my iPad is nothing's better.
[01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:08.640]   And someone should just build an app.
[01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:10.160]   I would love a mail app.
[01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:11.160]   This is my big request.
[01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:13.840]   I would just build a mail app that I can cash.
[01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:15.680]   What do you mean cash?
[01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:18.920]   I can pull all of my, like all of my email that I've gotten in the last three years.
[01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:20.240]   Well, that's a email does in the web.
[01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:21.240]   You know, but I don't want it on the web.
[01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:22.320]   It seems like mailbox should do that.
[01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:26.360]   I mean, given, I'm surprised that mailbox given that they've been acquired by Dropbox,
[01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:27.360]   like that seems like a great call.
[01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:28.360]   But I don't want it on the web.
[01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:29.840]   I want it on my phone.
[01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:30.840]   Right.
[01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:34.360]   But Dropbox, you can cash specifically like, you know, you can say, OK, I need 500 megabytes
[01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:35.800]   or five gigabytes or whatever.
[01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:37.840]   It seems like that's an opportunity for them to work in.
[01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:42.560]   Because I would switch to that immediately and then I would actually use mail.
[01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:44.160]   You know, on my iPad.
[01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:46.400]   I mean, you know, it's like, but the problem is I just look at it.
[01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:47.160]   I mean, I do.
[01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:50.680]   I try to respond on stuff on my iPhone, but the pro, you know, because it's with me all
[01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:51.200]   the time.
[01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:54.040]   But I know that there's like, like literally half the email.
[01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:55.800]   I'm not seeing my iPhone for whatever reason.
[01:05:55.800 --> 01:05:57.080]   It's just not showing up.
[01:05:57.080 --> 01:06:00.560]   I still think it's like a threaded conversation.
[01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:01.560]   No, it's just something.
[01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:04.800]   It makes me want to learn a programming language and go out there and write one.
[01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:06.840]   It doesn't mean even I thought that I wanted to learn.
[01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:10.000]   I think where it's really hard.
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:15.720]   Mail must be very hard because the brand, the first version of any mail program is broken
[01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:16.720]   irrevocably.
[01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:17.720]   Yeah.
[01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:18.720]   Mailbox is a good example.
[01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:20.360]   It just was just broken irrevocably.
[01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:21.360]   And then, you know, they fix it.
[01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:22.360]   They fix it.
[01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:24.200]   I guess as more people use it.
[01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:26.280]   But I guess mail is tough.
[01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:28.880]   It seems like it should be so simple.
[01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:30.600]   People all have different usage cases, right?
[01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:34.120]   Like Alex needs that caching, which is not something necessarily that everybody needs.
[01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:35.120]   But it's really important to him.
[01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:39.240]   And I think, you know, for example, I use flags a lot for like things I want to come back
[01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:40.240]   to.
[01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:44.160]   And for a long time, mail on iOS did not have that ability.
[01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:48.400]   So it's tough because people are very individualized in the way that they use their mail.
[01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:51.800]   And so what works well for somebody doesn't necessarily work well for somebody else.
[01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:54.000]   Also, it's hard to write my app.
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:55.000]   Go ahead.
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:56.760]   We should all write our own apps.
[01:06:56.760 --> 01:06:57.760]   Yeah.
[01:06:57.760 --> 01:06:58.760]   That's the end.
[01:06:58.760 --> 01:06:59.760]   We need to all write our own mail apps.
[01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:00.760]   Everybody make an app.
[01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:07.160]   Well, if only 10% of all users wrote apps, that presumably would cover all the use cases.
[01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:08.720]   That would be a lot of apps.
[01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:09.720]   So I'll have some kind of--
[01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:12.320]   And then you have the app to sort through your mail apps.
[01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:13.800]   And it just-- there's a rabbit hole.
[01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:14.800]   It gets tricky.
[01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:15.800]   Cashing.
[01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:18.000]   The other thing is caching is being able to just save it to a database.
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.000]   You know, just being able to--
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:20.000]   I was going to say--
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.000]   I was going to say, I know.
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.920]   Like, if there's one feature I would love to have, it's just simply give me a grayed
[01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:28.040]   out padlock icon next to every message.
[01:07:28.040 --> 01:07:31.440]   And if this is something that I definitely, definitely want to have online or offline,
[01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:33.840]   click the padlock, which means that keep this on my device.
[01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:34.840]   Never delete it.
[01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:36.640]   If you're-- if you run out of space, don't delete it.
[01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:37.640]   Make space.
[01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:38.640]   Or have a folder.
[01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:39.640]   Or have a folder.
[01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:40.640]   Then let me--
[01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:41.640]   Like, have a folder of, you know, like my whitelist, for instance.
[01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:43.920]   Like, I don't want to keep everything, but the stuff that's in my whitelist folder--
[01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:46.120]   these folders I want to be locked so that they stay on.
[01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:51.200]   A measure of how difficult this is is to look at Gmail, which is probably the most used--
[01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:54.720]   certainly by sophisticated users, the most used email program.
[01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:57.600]   And remember they did Priority Inbox a year ago, and now it's gone, and they've got some
[01:07:57.600 --> 01:07:58.600]   other solution.
[01:07:58.600 --> 01:08:00.400]   They can't figure it out either.
[01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:01.400]   Right.
[01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:03.000]   And someone asked about why I don't-- don't use pop.
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:04.480]   And the reason you don't use pop is because--
[01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:05.480]   Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:06.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:08.040]   Because it leads it on the server.
[01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:12.160]   Well, not only that, the big thing with pop is that you respond to something on your
[01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:14.600]   laptop, and you don't have any record of that on your--
[01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:15.600]   Right.
[01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:16.880]   No, you have to use iMac or some similar--
[01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:18.880]   It's just that you can go with it.
[01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:19.880]   --centralized system.
[01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:20.880]   Keep it.
[01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:26.600]   You know, Google now has primary, and then they have these tabs for social promotions,
[01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:27.760]   updates, and forms.
[01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:31.880]   I've actually found this to be fairly useful once you kind of understand how they're doing
[01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:32.880]   this.
[01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:35.120]   You have to turn that on.
[01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:39.080]   And then, you know, the theory behind Google's mail was that it would-- everything's saved.
[01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:40.080]   You don't ever delete anything.
[01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:41.080]   You archive it.
[01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:42.080]   I mean, you can delete it.
[01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:43.080]   But the idea is never--
[01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:46.080]   Again, as long as you're always connected, you're set.
[01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:47.080]   Except when you're on a--
[01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:48.080]   Right.
[01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:49.080]   So what you need--
[01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:50.880]   Ah, OK, I'm going to write this for you.
[01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:51.880]   Thanks, Leo.
[01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:55.360]   You need a program that will be a database, maybe we can write in FileMaker or something,
[01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:59.640]   and your desktop that will grab the Google mail, do all sorts of prior to--
[01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:00.640]   Well, it's a desktop.
[01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:01.640]   --and then put it in a database.
[01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:02.640]   But you want a database.
[01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:03.640]   Yeah.
[01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:04.640]   On my desktop, it's fine.
[01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:05.640]   Like, because it's all-- it is a database.
[01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:06.640]   It's all sitting there.
[01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:09.520]   Now, what I would do-- there are programs that I haven't quite figured out how to work
[01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:10.520]   completely.
[01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:13.160]   That will take everything out of mail and put it into a FileMaker document.
[01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:14.360]   There is somebody who writes that program.
[01:09:14.360 --> 01:09:15.360]   I can't get into it.
[01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:16.360]   Right.
[01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:17.360]   Yeah.
[01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:19.080]   So I'm sure that it could be written better, or I could learn better.
[01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:21.440]   I'm not a very smart guy.
[01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:27.880]   But the big problem is I really want to use my iPad as my primary computer, and I can't
[01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:28.880]   because it--
[01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:33.320]   Well, FileMaker can solve that because you use a FileMaker centralized database, and you
[01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:35.440]   use Bento or FileMaker client on your iPad.
[01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:37.640]   As long as you can see the network database.
[01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:40.320]   But the problem is that I've spent a lot of time on a plane.
[01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:41.560]   I'm not going to solve your problem.
[01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:42.560]   I'm going to solve mine.
[01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:43.560]   Yours is too hard.
[01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:47.120]   Just needs to let me-- all they need to do is just not be limited to 1,000 messages
[01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:48.120]   to be limited to--
[01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:49.120]   You know, Dropbox could do this.
[01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:51.320]   They bought mailbox, right?
[01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:58.280]   And Dropbox really is trying to get that exact thing solved so that it's always visible in
[01:09:58.280 --> 01:10:01.120]   all your devices.
[01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:02.120]   Dropbox could solve that.
[01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:04.080]   They're having a big conference right now, as a matter of fact.
[01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:09.760]   You know, the really sad thing is that back when I used to use Elm as my mail reader on
[01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:15.600]   a Unix box, it's like every time a search fails, any time organization fails, I remember,
[01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:18.800]   you know, there was a time where if I wanted to find an email, all I had to do was grep
[01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:20.800]   my inbox and I'd find it.
[01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:23.480]   I'd never, ever failed and was really quick and simple.
[01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:24.480]   I would love to do it.
[01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:25.480]   So Andy's--
[01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:26.480]   Andy's so fast.
[01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:27.480]   --the app is going to be called grep my inbox.
[01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:28.480]   I think that's where it's--
[01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:29.480]   I had a select--
[01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:30.480]   I had a select--
[01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:32.480]   I was just going to make a mail app called grep.
[01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:33.480]   You're famously--
[01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:35.240]   You're a popular Norwegian game show.
[01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:38.080]   Grep my inbox.
[01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:40.360]   It means something very bad in Norwegian, though, so don't--
[01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:41.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:45.520]   --only airs after 11.
[01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:49.160]   It just seems like such an opportunity.
[01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:50.680]   But I guess it's tough.
[01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:52.840]   You know, who's got so many levels.
[01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:57.280]   The other problem is I actually spent about an hour, hour and a half last week talking
[01:10:57.280 --> 01:11:01.080]   to the one to lead user interface engineers on Gmail.
[01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:04.440]   And they were saying that one of the problems is that they can make changes--
[01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:06.360]   this was kind of interesting.
[01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:11.600]   They feel as though they can make interface changes to search because they can't make
[01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:18.520]   to Gmail because people's relationship with Google search is that this is an app that
[01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:22.080]   it presents itself to everybody and it's an app that belongs to everybody.
[01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:26.160]   However, my Gmail inbox is my turf.
[01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:31.360]   And so if you make a change to how my spot of real estate works, people get very, very
[01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:33.240]   let's see about it.
[01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:38.680]   Reputedly, Hilary Mason is the chief scientist at Bitly has the most amazing email automation
[01:11:38.680 --> 01:11:39.840]   ever.
[01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:42.640]   She has written massive scripts.
[01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:43.640]   And I've been--
[01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:44.640]   Hilary, if you're listening.
[01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:45.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:47.280]   Come be on the show.
[01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:48.280]   Come be on the show.
[01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:50.120]   I really want to know how you do this.
[01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:53.920]   And it's like the Great White Whale.
[01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:55.400]   It's like Moby Dick.
[01:11:55.400 --> 01:11:57.040]   I've only heard tales of it.
[01:11:57.040 --> 01:11:59.400]   Well, and I think that the problem is you have to decide where you're going to filter
[01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:03.280]   too because I filter at mail, but I really should be filtering at Gmail because the problem
[01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:07.240]   that I have is that Gmail just looks like this random-- when I go into the web version
[01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:12.000]   of Gmail, it just looks like this random collection of stuff because I have 40 or 50
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:15.080]   rules that are putting things into folders for me.
[01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:19.640]   And if I-- in mail, but not in Gmail, so the web version has very limited--
[01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:22.440]   See, I don't think we're going to fix it with just an app.
[01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:25.280]   I think that the solution here is really more intelligence.
[01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:28.360]   I think we're going to see things like Siri and Google now that are like, all right,
[01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:32.520]   I'm just going to figure out based on algorithms like here are the three emails that I need
[01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:33.760]   to tell you about.
[01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:36.520]   And then when you bring up your summary of like, OK, what's going on today?
[01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:38.280]   I was like, oh, here are these three emails you need to look at.
[01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:43.560]   I think it's so entrenched with email itself and with the way mail clients work that it's
[01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:46.880]   really hard to just go in and fix that by writing a new app.
[01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:50.680]   But if you can write something that sort of overlays that and just sort of cuts out all
[01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:53.920]   the trash, it's kind of like a spam filter, but it's something even more intelligent.
[01:12:53.920 --> 01:12:57.600]   And it seems like something that you're right, Dan.
[01:12:57.600 --> 01:13:00.320]   It seems like something that intelligence could really figure out.
[01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:04.800]   It seems as though the app can figure out that, oh, it seems as though Andy always clicks
[01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:07.800]   on a mail that's been sent by Alex Lindsey.
[01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:09.560]   I will base that.
[01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:12.640]   That's a vote for-- make sure that his emails go a little bit closer to the top.
[01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:14.320]   It's with priority inboxes to do.
[01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:15.960]   But I guess it didn't work because they--
[01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:18.240]   And what mailbox is service-like component was supposed to--
[01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:19.240]   Right.
[01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:20.720]   But all these wonderful dreams--
[01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:22.800]   Why do these things not work?
[01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:30.240]   The most-- I should almost keep a little leaderboard of the most upset that a certain
[01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:33.840]   piece of hardware or software has ever made me over calendar year and give out an award
[01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:35.440]   at the end of the year.
[01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:37.200]   Because Skype would win that award year.
[01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:38.200]   What about that?
[01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:41.720]   That would have to retire to the Hall of Fame probably.
[01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:43.720]   I don't know if it's fixable.
[01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:47.320]   I've been using Gmail for years and I'm getting email.
[01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:50.760]   I miss email and I go there and I search for it and I see it and it turns out that it's
[01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:54.680]   in the all mail but not in the inbox and I have zero filters running on Gmail.
[01:13:54.680 --> 01:13:55.680]   So there's no reason--
[01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:57.760]   No, we most try to be smart and that may be a mistake.
[01:13:57.760 --> 01:13:58.760]   Yeah.
[01:13:58.760 --> 01:13:59.760]   Well, on the flip side, I still get spam.
[01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:02.280]   And this seems like a problem that we should have had to finish.
[01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:03.840]   I think Gmail's done pretty well.
[01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:06.720]   I do get spam but it's done pretty well with the spam, right?
[01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:07.720]   Yeah.
[01:14:07.720 --> 01:14:09.880]   I think Gmail has solved that issue.
[01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:10.880]   Thank God.
[01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:14.400]   It hasn't solved my 28,000 emails in my inbox issue.
[01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:20.400]   It solves it if you think it's okay to use Gmail and the fact that at some level content
[01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:25.400]   is being exposed to Google means that I can't use it for a whole bunch of communications.
[01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:27.160]   Well, you can't use anything that's not--
[01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:28.840]   Well, the spam filter then.
[01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:29.840]   No, well, no.
[01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:32.640]   I can use completely client size.
[01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:35.440]   Yeah, you can use spam assassin on your own server.
[01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:36.440]   Right.
[01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:38.280]   You can't use any web mail.
[01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:41.720]   Well, Google is a separate thing.
[01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:45.720]   Sometimes you need to be able to tell somebody that the content of this email was never,
[01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:48.040]   ever, ever looked at by any-- excuse me.
[01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:52.800]   As far as the sender or the receiver knows, has never been looked at by either the sender
[01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:53.800]   or the receiver.
[01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:58.920]   It's not that I think that Google is quietly indexing every email that goes through my
[01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:04.520]   Gmail box just to use the-- mine it for stuff that they can use against me or for their own
[01:15:04.520 --> 01:15:05.520]   purposes.
[01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:07.440]   But nonetheless, it's a binary thing.
[01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:11.640]   Either this thing is a privileged piece of information between the sender and the recipient
[01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:12.640]   or it isn't.
[01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:17.960]   And even if Google is just examining it for AdWords, they can attach to while I'm viewing
[01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:19.360]   it, that's not good enough.
[01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:23.720]   That's why Gmail is-- it's not a fail, but it's not an adequate solution for my name.
[01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:28.240]   That kind of thing always makes me wonder why the sort of a more seamless encryption,
[01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:32.800]   mail encryption hasn't become more popular, especially recently with all the revelations
[01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:34.800]   of the government and things like that.
[01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:39.280]   It seems like that's something that you could build into a mail client.
[01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:40.280]   It does seem like it.
[01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:46.920]   I know that there was one point in the PIXA core probably in 2002, 2003 where it was required.
[01:15:46.920 --> 01:15:48.920]   Everybody in the company was on PIXA.
[01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:49.920]   Really?
[01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:50.920]   Wow.
[01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:55.160]   So you guarantee that those emails are now stored in the NSA's file system.
[01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:56.160]   Exactly.
[01:15:56.160 --> 01:15:58.360]   Because they said the owner is still, right?
[01:15:58.360 --> 01:15:59.360]   It's not hard.
[01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:01.440]   No, I have to say this part.
[01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:04.960]   It has gotten very easy if you're using Mac and Apple Mail.
[01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:05.960]   It's very easy.
[01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:09.480]   The GPG tool now is trivial to-- they've really solved it.
[01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:11.160]   In fact, I have it installed here.
[01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:17.480]   So why don't I do a new mail if I click this little certificate button, I've digitally
[01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:20.480]   signed it with OpenPGP.
[01:16:20.480 --> 01:16:24.640]   Then now, if I want to encrypt an email to you, then what I have to do is search for
[01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:28.280]   you on the-- if I don't have your key already, search for you on the key server, that's gotten
[01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:29.280]   very easy too.
[01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:35.280]   Especially if you know the ID, you and I could send an encrypted email pretty straightforwardly.
[01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:37.800]   But you need to have buy-in from everybody, right?
[01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:38.800]   Well, the person, yes.
[01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:41.960]   You can only encrypt it to people who want to encrypt it because they have to be able
[01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:44.640]   to-- you have to have their key and they have to have your key.
[01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:47.480]   But it's so easy to install it now.
[01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:50.320]   I'm hoping that more people do just turn this on.
[01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:52.120]   When I mentioned this last week, I started getting emails.
[01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:54.000]   I realize I didn't know it was there.
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:55.000]   Let me show you.
[01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:58.360]   I thought I made this the pick of the week last week.
[01:16:58.360 --> 01:17:02.640]   It's gpgtools.org.
[01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:04.320]   And this installer is trivial.
[01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:08.720]   Now, the issue with-- first of all, it's open source, which I think is really important.
[01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:11.080]   You can use some other system, a certificate system.
[01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:14.600]   But there is no guarantee that that's not being broken at some point upstream.
[01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:17.320]   This, you're generating your public and your private key.
[01:17:17.320 --> 01:17:19.840]   You're sharing your public key on their key server.
[01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:22.360]   It's at MIT.
[01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:25.560]   But nobody's really validated that that's your key.
[01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:28.280]   So what you have to then do is say, hey, please sign my key.
[01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:29.960]   People actually have key signing parties.
[01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:31.280]   But I'll sign your key.
[01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:32.480]   And you sign my key.
[01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:33.680]   And that makes it somewhat more.
[01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:36.360]   And you develop what's called a circle of trust.
[01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:40.280]   So if Renee, Richie, Annie, and Aco, and Alex Lindsey have signed my key,
[01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:44.160]   he's pretty certain that that's my key.
[01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:46.120]   So it becomes more and more trustworthy over time.
[01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:48.040]   And all of that's exposed and visible.
[01:17:48.040 --> 01:17:49.840]   It's trivial to install this on Apple Mail.
[01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:54.520]   It's one of the reasons I continue to use Apple Mail is because it's so easy to put this on.
[01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:57.720]   Once you've got your keys, you can export them and put them on all your machines.
[01:17:57.720 --> 01:17:59.400]   It's harder to do it on mobile.
[01:17:59.400 --> 01:17:59.920]   Right.
[01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:03.080]   I haven't figured that out yet.
[01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:11.480]   And I think that these types of things on mobile and everything else, because of the NSA stuff,
[01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:13.880]   is going to become a booming industry.
[01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:15.360]   I can't ever wish.
[01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:17.400]   You know, I think that they've really built--
[01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:21.880]   if someone wants to look at the next great apps that make them lots of money,
[01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:23.680]   it's probably going to be encrypted communication.
[01:18:23.680 --> 01:18:29.200]   One of-- I think Samsung provides built-in encryption to their email client.
[01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:30.200]   I can't remember who it is.
[01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:30.200]   Right.
[01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:31.200]   But then one guy is learning software.
[01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:34.680]   He's already talking about enhanced or premium security.
[01:18:34.680 --> 01:18:36.640]   And they were referencing a lot of the news cycles as well.
[01:18:36.640 --> 01:18:39.400]   So it looks like it's going to be something people start competing on, which is nice.
[01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:39.920]   Yeah.
[01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:39.920]   Right.
[01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:41.880]   It's exactly the opposite of what the NSA wanted.
[01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:42.880]   Yeah.
[01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:43.640]   Like, we--
[01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:45.000]   That's why they're going after Snowden.
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:45.360]   I'm sorry.
[01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:46.200]   Go ahead, Dan.
[01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:48.080]   I was just saying that the companies start providing it, though.
[01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:49.920]   Then people start having the same freak out over.
[01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:52.160]   Well, does that mean I have my keys?
[01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:52.880]   Does the company have that?
[01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:54.480]   That's why you use open source.
[01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:58.160]   That's why you use GPG or PGP, because you keep the keys.
[01:18:58.160 --> 01:19:00.400]   No one else has the keys.
[01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:01.680]   It is absolutely secure.
[01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:05.400]   And you can make it a 2048 or 4,096 key.
[01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:10.680]   And the thing is that Richard Yass said in the chat room, no one cares,
[01:19:10.680 --> 01:19:13.640]   except for terrorists or whatever the NSA.
[01:19:13.640 --> 01:19:16.680]   The big thing is that a lot of people-- the question is, is how hard will they
[01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:17.680]   try to become encrypted?
[01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:20.480]   But if it becomes super easy to be encrypted, everyone's just going to put on--
[01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:25.680]   if it doesn't cost you anything in time to put a 40, 40, 96 on, everyone's just put a 49.
[01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:26.280]   And you want to see--
[01:19:26.280 --> 01:19:30.160]   If it's something you have to turn off as opposed to turn on, that changes the whole game.
[01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:32.680]   And you must see law enforcement have a fit.
[01:19:32.680 --> 01:19:33.960]   Everyone's on 40, 96.
[01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:35.400]   Do that.
[01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:36.200]   It will make--
[01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:39.480]   And they would pass laws to make encryption illegal at that point.
[01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:40.480]   I swear to you, they will.
[01:19:40.480 --> 01:19:41.960]   I think it's a politically complicated thing to do.
[01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:44.480]   Well, it might be hard to do.
[01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:46.080]   That would really raise the stakes.
[01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:49.480]   I mean, the thing is, there are so many of these little privacy
[01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:54.600]   intrusions like license plate capture systems that are just as a matter of routine set up
[01:19:54.600 --> 01:19:57.680]   to every car going in and out of a certain city that they simply--
[01:19:57.680 --> 01:19:58.680]   Oh, I'll see.
[01:19:58.680 --> 01:20:02.080]   Well, you can't have a law against this because this is simple visual confirmation.
[01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:03.880]   But once you simply say, OK, that's great.
[01:20:03.880 --> 01:20:04.880]   Hi.
[01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:05.880]   I'm-- this is Google.
[01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:06.880]   This is Microsoft.
[01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:07.880]   This is Apple.
[01:20:07.880 --> 01:20:11.200]   And we have all decided that we're going to make a really good encryption default on
[01:20:11.200 --> 01:20:14.760]   every single piece of hardware and software that we sell.
[01:20:14.760 --> 01:20:19.440]   And now law enforcement has to say, OK, we're going to demand a law saying
[01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:24.800]   that we have the right to look into private mail for any reason without a warrant.
[01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:27.640]   That is an expensive piece of legislation to get.
[01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:28.720]   I don't think they do that.
[01:20:28.720 --> 01:20:32.320]   I think what they do is they just go, I bet you anything they've already done this.
[01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:35.200]   They've gone to Microsoft and said, we'd like a backdoor to BitLocker.
[01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:38.640]   They've gone to Apple saying we'd like a backdoor to FileVault.
[01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:40.920]   A backdoor is a very-- is a different thing.
[01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:45.000]   You can-- the thing is, you can set up an encryption system so that the creator of the
[01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:49.400]   system does not-- it's sort of like how a BitTorrent originally worked.
[01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:50.760]   Or an appster originally works.
[01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:52.800]   And you can come to me, the creator of Napster.
[01:20:52.800 --> 01:20:55.720]   But the thing is, I don't have a copy of that thing that you say got stolen.
[01:20:55.720 --> 01:21:00.240]   I simply created a mechanism so that people can do whatever they want with a certain level
[01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:01.240]   of freedom.
[01:21:01.240 --> 01:21:05.440]   So if they were afraid of that, they could create a system so that, yes, if you'd like,
[01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:08.960]   you can come to us with a proper paperwork and we can try to get into it.
[01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:12.440]   But we don't have to-- we don't have to put in a backdoor unless you actually pass a
[01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:14.400]   law saying that this is required.
[01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:15.640]   And we're going to fight you against that.
[01:21:15.640 --> 01:21:19.920]   Well, and also having a backdoor means there's inherently a vulnerability for people to get
[01:21:19.920 --> 01:21:20.920]   into.
[01:21:20.920 --> 01:21:21.920]   Exactly.
[01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:22.920]   Yeah.
[01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:23.920]   And that's why they would argue against it.
[01:21:23.920 --> 01:21:24.920]   Well, I think--
[01:21:24.920 --> 01:21:28.920]   I mean, the nice thing about having-- about using Apple and using Google for your mail
[01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:33.200]   service is that you know that you're a smaller ISP.
[01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:36.920]   Once someone shows up at their front door-- once law enforcement asks, and we don't have a
[01:21:36.920 --> 01:21:40.760]   warrant, we don't have the paperwork, but we're going to make it very, very-- your life
[01:21:40.760 --> 01:21:45.000]   will be so much easier if you give us access to one of your clients' email inboxes.
[01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:48.640]   They don't have the resources necessarily to fight that battle every single day.
[01:21:48.640 --> 01:21:53.240]   Google and Apple, they have departments that will say, great, here is-- here is-- please
[01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:58.520]   enjoy this iBooks-- iBooks author document explains exactly the procedure that we have
[01:21:58.520 --> 01:22:01.680]   for you asking us to give you client data.
[01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:04.560]   And that's one of the better defenders of your personal information.
[01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:10.840]   And I think that-- I think that again, it's one of those-- one of the issues where it's
[01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:14.320]   one thing for the government to just kind of suck up lots and lots of information.
[01:22:14.320 --> 01:22:18.600]   And it is another thing for them to explicitly require people to leave their door-- right,
[01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:19.600]   their front door open.
[01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:21.000]   And that's also the American government.
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.240]   I mean, I'm subject to a completely different government.
[01:22:23.240 --> 01:22:24.520]   I don't know what your government's doing to me.
[01:22:24.520 --> 01:22:26.240]   I don't know what other governments are doing.
[01:22:26.240 --> 01:22:30.840]   So even if you solve the American problem, we were in a whole world now where everyone
[01:22:30.840 --> 01:22:35.080]   is looking at this information, which is very uncomfortable.
[01:22:35.080 --> 01:22:36.600]   Here's some good news to cheer you up.
[01:22:36.600 --> 01:22:40.240]   Apple and Amazon have ended their lawsuit over the after the--
[01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:41.240]   That's a great story.
[01:22:41.240 --> 01:22:42.240]   Oh.
[01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:45.760]   That's good news for them, I guess.
[01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:46.760]   I guess.
[01:22:46.760 --> 01:22:48.800]   So the trial was scheduled for August 19th.
[01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:52.400]   Remember Amazon called its App Store and App Store.
[01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:54.400]   Apple said, wait a minute.
[01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:56.920]   We got an App Store.
[01:22:56.920 --> 01:22:59.640]   App Store and Apple parlance is two words.
[01:22:59.640 --> 01:23:02.920]   In Amazon parlance is one word, the App Store for Android.
[01:23:02.920 --> 01:23:08.720]   Apple spokeswoman Kristen Hugut said, "We no longer see a need to pursue our case.
[01:23:08.720 --> 01:23:12.960]   With more than 900,000 apps and 50 billion downloads, customers know where they can
[01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:16.800]   purchase their favorite apps."
[01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:20.560]   Marty Glick, that can't be his name.
[01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:23.200]   Isn't that Martin Short's sweaty lawyer?
[01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:30.640]   Anyway, Marty Glick, a lawyer for Amazon, said, "This was a decision by Apple.
[01:23:30.640 --> 01:23:35.600]   Unilaterally abandoned the case and leave Amazon free to use App Store."
[01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:37.120]   So it's over.
[01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:38.120]   They gave up.
[01:23:38.120 --> 01:23:39.120]   That's one.
[01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:40.120]   That's one.
[01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:44.000]   That's the recent downloading of our 45,000,000th app.
[01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:47.200]   We believe that we've created the entire brand awareness.
[01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:48.680]   Huge win for lack of creative.
[01:23:48.680 --> 01:23:50.400]   Even Blackberry could come up with App World.
[01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:53.040]   How hard is it to come up with a name for an App Store that's not confusing?
[01:23:53.040 --> 01:23:56.360]   Yeah, but you think, though, Amazon, I mean, it does say App Store for Android.
[01:23:56.360 --> 01:23:58.240]   I don't think they were trying to confuse people.
[01:23:58.240 --> 01:24:00.720]   Also, I mean, Vegetables, like Grocery Store.
[01:24:00.720 --> 01:24:01.720]   Oh, my God.
[01:24:01.720 --> 01:24:06.920]   That's such a brilliant breakthrough bit of design that, no, it's App Store.
[01:24:06.920 --> 01:24:07.920]   Play.
[01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:08.920]   How creative is that?
[01:24:08.920 --> 01:24:10.280]   I mean, no one's going to confuse that.
[01:24:10.280 --> 01:24:14.600]   Well, I do think that this points to a little bit of Tim Cook versus Steve Jobs, where Tim's
[01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:16.080]   just like, "This isn't worth the trouble."
[01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:17.680]   Like Steve Jobs is a pretty simple--
[01:24:17.680 --> 01:24:18.680]   Right.
[01:24:18.680 --> 01:24:22.960]   This is something that he is, you know, personally, I think he was very like, "You can't touch
[01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:26.880]   our turf and we don't want," you know, and Tim Cook, I think, looks at everything like,
[01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:28.200]   "Man, this doesn't make any sense."
[01:24:28.200 --> 01:24:31.280]   Maybe this will herald a kind of a new approach to all this, you know.
[01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:33.400]   And Apple's losing some cases with Samsung too.
[01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:36.560]   There have been injunctions against selling iPads and iPhones in the US, and this is
[01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:38.080]   going-- I mean, just a mess.
[01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:39.600]   It's ugly on both sides.
[01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:49.480]   Now Boston University's suing Apple for a variety of things, apparently.
[01:24:49.480 --> 01:24:51.880]   I believe that was a local news story around here.
[01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:53.880]   I believe it's a professor who came up with it.
[01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:54.880]   Right.
[01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:58.040]   Gallyam, Thingallyam, nitride, films.
[01:24:58.040 --> 01:25:01.680]   He says, "I made that up and Apple's been using it, but apparently others are already
[01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:04.240]   paying him license fees."
[01:25:04.240 --> 01:25:06.320]   Patton only has a year to run.
[01:25:06.320 --> 01:25:08.280]   I guess he needs to get it now.
[01:25:08.280 --> 01:25:08.960]   He--
[01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:11.200]   Boston University needs some money.
[01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:13.480]   Right.
[01:25:13.480 --> 01:25:16.080]   But they do want to ban Apple products.
[01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:19.400]   That's part of the lawsuit.
[01:25:19.400 --> 01:25:20.760]   I don't know why this--
[01:25:20.760 --> 01:25:22.120]   That's always the way you have to ask for them.
[01:25:22.120 --> 01:25:24.360]   I want to ban the product.
[01:25:24.360 --> 01:25:25.880]   I think it doesn't make you not want to ban the actual--
[01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:31.200]   --stop Apple from selling or distributing the products that use this Gallyam nitride technology.
[01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:33.600]   I want to ban this product unless you will bring some large--
[01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:35.980]   We're sold. We're black, we're dollar signs on the side.
[01:25:35.980 --> 01:25:44.020]   We're being completely reasonable. We just want to temporary injunction against all Apple products, just why we hash this out.
[01:25:44.020 --> 01:25:47.880]   Yeah, let's just figure this out. Did you guys see this American life about patents?
[01:25:47.880 --> 01:25:53.960]   There's two now and they did the second one, which is a must listen, apparently. I have not listened to it. It was a must listen.
[01:25:53.960 --> 01:26:00.940]   Yeah, it's about the podcast. That's for carbonite. Yeah, and they had, because carbonite is the one that fought the.
[01:26:00.940 --> 01:26:03.440]   Love that.
[01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:10.720]   Apple One computer fetches $387,000 at Christie's auction. Hope you saved. I would have gotten it.
[01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:14.080]   If I had three and ready to save your Apple one and have an Apple one.
[01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:17.840]   I should have saved it. My first one was an Apple two E. That's not worth nearly as much.
[01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:27.120]   Those were always crazy expensive. But I remember when I was in junior high, the classified ads and the backup bike magazine,
[01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:34.600]   seeing an Apple one that caught my eye. And even then, this was like early 80s. And even then, the asking price was something like $2,000.
[01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:38.120]   I thought two weeks. That's always been. Yeah.
[01:26:38.120 --> 01:26:44.040]   That was the $2,500 was the benchmark price for computers for years. And now it's like $200.
[01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:48.640]   Amazing. You kids, you don't know what you got.
[01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:49.640]   You get it.
[01:26:49.640 --> 01:26:52.480]   We had to get for that. What was the resolution?
[01:26:52.480 --> 01:26:59.680]   I bought it. It was like 192 by one by two. Was it 192 by by 128 and eight colors or something?
[01:26:59.680 --> 01:27:02.000]   Because I need to write code for it. And low res graphics.
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:07.280]   Right. All this code and it would always turn HDR to that's why Dan, like that game I came from there.
[01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:11.040]   But that was one of the freebies during the app. Exactly.
[01:27:11.040 --> 01:27:15.160]   Round be. This is exactly like HDR two graphics on the Apple two.
[01:27:15.160 --> 01:27:18.480]   E. This is awesome. Only the frame. The frame rate is somewhat better.
[01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:22.040]   How many hours? I know it's no number of munchers, but it's pretty great.
[01:27:22.040 --> 01:27:26.520]   I don't know how many colors you wanted because I think if it's at one day, two by 128, you got like 16 colors.
[01:27:26.520 --> 01:27:31.840]   You're calling it, but at lower resolution, you go into low res mode and you get more colors.
[01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:34.600]   You get more colors for that. It's been downhill ever since little breakout.
[01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:37.960]   Let's just let's just say that in front. That's why Apple had one color. It was green.
[01:27:37.960 --> 01:27:40.640]   It's because of was is clever. You know, my memory mapping.
[01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:43.200]   So here's an Apple and Apple to boot.
[01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:46.560]   This is this make you feel.
[01:27:46.560 --> 01:27:49.000]   So good.
[01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:54.300]   And now I'm to you standing at the edge of a rich
[01:27:54.300 --> 01:27:56.200]   and forest on top of the.
[01:27:56.200 --> 01:28:00.120]   I guess this is a whole video of just what it's got to be something.
[01:28:00.120 --> 01:28:02.880]   Here's some graphics.
[01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:04.920]   Well, that's some journey movement.
[01:28:04.920 --> 01:28:07.600]   And Asia playing in the background just to set the whole time.
[01:28:07.600 --> 01:28:09.600]   I think there is put turn up the audio.
[01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:17.440]   This is not how good the sound was.
[01:28:17.440 --> 01:28:21.760]   And this is somebody doing lyrics to the.
[01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:25.280]   And ask you all right enough enough.
[01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:27.800]   I don't know. I found it on YouTube and I'm sorry.
[01:28:27.800 --> 01:28:30.880]   I'm pretty. We spoke to Jordan Meckner about making Karateka.
[01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:33.960]   And he said that you couldn't do movement and sound at the same time.
[01:28:33.960 --> 01:28:36.880]   So just stop whatever was happening and then play a sound then move it again.
[01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:38.960]   That explains a lot about that game.
[01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:40.320]   That explains the eagle.
[01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:43.280]   Meckner, though, went on to do Prince of Persia, which was not bad.
[01:28:43.280 --> 01:28:46.400]   Yeah, absolutely. Not bad at all.
[01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:52.080]   So we're getting some information from the code in the iOS beta.
[01:28:52.080 --> 01:28:56.160]   For instance, offline voice dictation for iOS,
[01:28:56.160 --> 01:28:58.360]   yay, which would be nice.
[01:28:58.360 --> 01:29:04.440]   Hidden iOS beta option points to iOS in the car, airplace support over Wi-Fi.
[01:29:04.440 --> 01:29:06.360]   We know a lot of car manufacturers.
[01:29:06.360 --> 01:29:09.960]   Remember that that slide of all the car manufacturers are going to put Siri in their cars.
[01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:12.360]   I'm just waiting for Apple to release a car.
[01:29:12.360 --> 01:29:14.840]   The pedal will be on the left.
[01:29:14.840 --> 01:29:16.360]   There was we don't know.
[01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:19.080]   It won't be a pedal. You don't even break any accelerator.
[01:29:19.080 --> 01:29:21.720]   No, no, no, no. You'll just lean forward a little bit.
[01:29:21.720 --> 01:29:22.720]   It'd be like a segment.
[01:29:22.720 --> 01:29:24.000]   Yeah, it's a segment.
[01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:27.240]   We find that 20% of drivers almost never turn left.
[01:29:27.240 --> 01:29:31.920]   They're really cool. I mean, if you want to go left, you just take like three rights.
[01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:33.560]   Yeah, exactly. You've pretty much done it.
[01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:34.600]   That's simpler.
[01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:36.680]   I just think it's a little more driving.
[01:29:36.680 --> 01:29:38.680]   There's less stress. It's a workaround.
[01:29:38.680 --> 01:29:41.200]   Just think you never have to take a left turn.
[01:29:41.200 --> 01:29:44.000]   I mean, you just think of all the stress you go through about looking at one
[01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000]   coming traffic and all the stuff that's going left.
[01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.920]   And once everybody on the road is only taking right turns,
[01:29:48.920 --> 01:29:51.600]   traffic just flows that much more smoothly.
[01:29:51.600 --> 01:29:53.680]   Plus the mapping stuff really works great then.
[01:29:53.680 --> 01:29:57.240]   Have you guys played with the, I guess for some reason,
[01:29:57.240 --> 01:30:02.040]   I got the beta for iWork implemented and it's pretty cool.
[01:30:02.040 --> 01:30:06.520]   Even works on a non-Apple computers quite well, which is Nito.
[01:30:06.520 --> 01:30:07.880]   You know, yeah.
[01:30:07.880 --> 01:30:09.560]   iOS in the car thing before you move on.
[01:30:09.560 --> 01:30:12.480]   Yes. That's actually really cool because it looks like,
[01:30:12.480 --> 01:30:14.120]   I mean, when Apple introduced AirPlay,
[01:30:14.120 --> 01:30:17.280]   you could start projecting an interface from an iOS device to a television.
[01:30:17.280 --> 01:30:17.600]   Right.
[01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:20.560]   And it looks like this builds on it and takes it sort of the next level
[01:30:20.560 --> 01:30:22.080]   where it becomes an interactive thing.
[01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:25.400]   And if you buy a car that has a built-in system, that's fine.
[01:30:25.400 --> 01:30:27.760]   But car manufacturers aren't always great about letting you upgrade,
[01:30:27.760 --> 01:30:29.680]   you know, the next year's radio or next year's thing.
[01:30:29.680 --> 01:30:29.960]   Right.
[01:30:29.960 --> 01:30:33.040]   But when you decouple interface from device and you can just project an
[01:30:33.040 --> 01:30:37.120]   interface onto a car screen, the device will update and then you'll
[01:30:37.120 --> 01:30:40.040]   automatically get all of that for free on the car.
[01:30:40.040 --> 01:30:42.680]   And I think, and if you started thinking about Apple projecting interfaces
[01:30:42.680 --> 01:30:45.240]   into other technology, it's really interesting.
[01:30:45.240 --> 01:30:49.040]   The car thing is huge because, I mean, I bought a new car last year
[01:30:49.040 --> 01:30:52.080]   and I had so much frustration with the electronics.
[01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:53.520]   Everything in this car was awesome.
[01:30:53.520 --> 01:30:54.680]   I thought it was really well designed.
[01:30:54.680 --> 01:30:55.440]   It's a Volkswagen.
[01:30:55.440 --> 01:30:58.680]   It's just got some really nice UI for like just the climate controls
[01:30:58.680 --> 01:31:00.200]   and most of the stuff that's in there.
[01:31:00.200 --> 01:31:02.680]   And then there's the radio and it's terrible.
[01:31:02.680 --> 01:31:03.680]   It's so bad.
[01:31:03.680 --> 01:31:07.520]   I mean, it's this primitive touchscreen that feels like you're at like an ATM or something.
[01:31:07.520 --> 01:31:10.960]   And the firmware takes like two hours to update.
[01:31:10.960 --> 01:31:12.520]   You got to bring it into the shop.
[01:31:12.520 --> 01:31:16.680]   And I had this huge problem where on the Bluetooth streaming, it would only play.
[01:31:16.680 --> 01:31:17.840]   It would play one channel.
[01:31:17.840 --> 01:31:20.920]   It would play the right channel over both speakers, which is maddening.
[01:31:20.920 --> 01:31:25.120]   If you listen to any sort of like classic rock music, there's only one channel.
[01:31:25.120 --> 01:31:29.880]   And I I I I do wonder how much car manufacturers there are, how attached they are
[01:31:29.880 --> 01:31:30.640]   to what they're doing.
[01:31:30.640 --> 01:31:32.320]   But I think someone who wants to be competitive.
[01:31:32.320 --> 01:31:37.000]   I mean, I know that I would buy a my next car if if I was looking at one and it had
[01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:42.960]   an iOS based system that I knew that was just an iOS that just ran on it that you
[01:31:42.960 --> 01:31:46.800]   could put apps on and do all the other things, even if it's going to be a key.
[01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:48.160]   Yeah, I buy that.
[01:31:48.160 --> 01:31:52.400]   No, but actually two things for Rene Rene is spot on.
[01:31:52.400 --> 01:31:56.680]   That's that's one thing that really got my full attention when I saw it in the keynote
[01:31:56.680 --> 01:32:01.880]   and having talked to car companies that are using this technology.
[01:32:01.880 --> 01:32:06.480]   I was chiefly talking to them to ask them, well, is this because my first question
[01:32:06.480 --> 01:32:07.360]   was, well, great.
[01:32:07.360 --> 01:32:11.040]   So this is going to be an option for people who buy the 50, 60, $70,000 car.
[01:32:11.040 --> 01:32:14.840]   And no, this is for people who even buy like the $17,000 budget car.
[01:32:14.840 --> 01:32:20.800]   Not only that, but I was talked to people who work in GM service and saying that they
[01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:24.640]   will actually just have a service upgrade for a lot of existing cars that will make it work.
[01:32:24.640 --> 01:32:28.600]   And Rene, the thing that really got my attention and also and this has only got me
[01:32:28.600 --> 01:32:33.720]   more excited is that so Apple, I think Apple has just quietly said, we have the ability
[01:32:33.720 --> 01:32:39.880]   to project iOS and lots of its user interface elements onto any screen of any size of any
[01:32:39.880 --> 01:32:43.760]   capabilities that we choose makes sense for our strategic plan.
[01:32:43.760 --> 01:32:48.200]   So Apple doesn't comment, but unannounced products, but sometimes they have to say,
[01:32:48.200 --> 01:32:50.720]   look at this thing, we can put inside a tiny little car screen.
[01:32:50.720 --> 01:32:56.840]   It has nothing to do with a tablet or a phone and say, think about what you want about this.
[01:32:56.840 --> 01:33:01.560]   I just think that's a huge market that Apple is maybe starting to look at.
[01:33:01.560 --> 01:33:05.720]   I mean, whether it's appliances or cars or all the other things, we kind of want them all
[01:33:05.720 --> 01:33:07.720]   really, really tied in.
[01:33:07.720 --> 01:33:11.160]   Like, I think that I know that I would be very, you know, for almost anything that I buy
[01:33:11.160 --> 01:33:18.080]   that that remotely has a, you know, a brain, you know, I would love to love to have that information.
[01:33:18.080 --> 01:33:19.160]   I don't even care if it's tied in.
[01:33:19.160 --> 01:33:20.560]   I just want to work better.
[01:33:20.560 --> 01:33:22.320]   Like that's my problem with so many things.
[01:33:22.320 --> 01:33:27.440]   There's so, I mean, car manufacturers, core competency is not building UIs for stereo
[01:33:27.440 --> 01:33:28.920]   and ventilation systems, right?
[01:33:28.920 --> 01:33:30.040]   It's building cars.
[01:33:30.040 --> 01:33:31.840]   So, yeah, we have outsourced that.
[01:33:31.840 --> 01:33:32.440]   Absolutely.
[01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:37.040]   I mean, we have a CRV, and all I want is to take that big screen that they came with it
[01:33:37.040 --> 01:33:41.880]   and just pop it out and put my iPad in, you know, and then just, but what I really want
[01:33:41.880 --> 01:33:44.520]   is then to have all the data that's coming in from the car.
[01:33:44.520 --> 01:33:46.680]   So then people could be writing apps to look at the data.
[01:33:46.680 --> 01:33:50.560]   That's tricky too, though, because you really want to isolate the car's computer system.
[01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:51.680]   No, you don't want to control it.
[01:33:51.680 --> 01:33:53.880]   I don't want to control the car, but you can have it one way.
[01:33:53.880 --> 01:33:57.320]   There's companies that make these little, you know, what do they call those stock?
[01:33:57.320 --> 01:33:59.000]   But imagine that being fed.
[01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:02.080]   And there's something that used Bluetooth to feed it to your iPhone now, but what if
[01:34:02.080 --> 01:34:05.880]   you could just, that was part of what's there and then people could write their own apps
[01:34:05.880 --> 01:34:07.360]   to see and manage that data.
[01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:10.480]   When we talked to Ford, that was one of the things they kept saying is we know our platforms
[01:34:10.480 --> 01:34:12.920]   don't evolve as quickly as consumer technology.
[01:34:12.920 --> 01:34:15.080]   That's why we want to have an API.
[01:34:15.080 --> 01:34:19.920]   That's why we want to, you know, court developers, but they still want a very tightly controlled
[01:34:19.920 --> 01:34:20.920]   interface.
[01:34:20.920 --> 01:34:23.280]   You're basically saying, let's give it to Apple and see what they do.
[01:34:23.280 --> 01:34:25.280]   Get out a lot of companies of the way.
[01:34:25.280 --> 01:34:28.920]   And the thing that Andy said that I think is really interesting is when Apple did iOS
[01:34:28.920 --> 01:34:30.520]   7, people complained about the icons.
[01:34:30.520 --> 01:34:34.440]   They complained about the font size, but Apple built a physics engine, a particle engine.
[01:34:34.440 --> 01:34:38.920]   They made a dynamic interface, something that has existed in other technology for years,
[01:34:38.920 --> 01:34:41.040]   but they put everything together and made it mobile.
[01:34:41.040 --> 01:34:45.880]   And when you add iOS in the car and airplay, you can now have that dynamic interface rendered
[01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:48.720]   on the fly on other devices.
[01:34:48.720 --> 01:34:53.120]   And that opens the floodgate to anything basically running iOS at some point, as long as Apple
[01:34:53.120 --> 01:34:54.640]   comes to the agreements to do it.
[01:34:54.640 --> 01:34:59.200]   Do you do it with, now Ford did a deal with Microsoft, Microsoft car, but Microsoft really
[01:34:59.200 --> 01:35:03.000]   gets out of the way and let's Ford put their UI on top of it.
[01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:04.880]   Audi does stuff with Google.
[01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:07.120]   >> With QNIX and a lot of cars.
[01:35:07.120 --> 01:35:08.800]   >> Who would you want to work with?
[01:35:08.800 --> 01:35:10.560]   Microsoft, Apple, Google, who would you want to do?
[01:35:10.560 --> 01:35:11.560]   >> You don't have to.
[01:35:11.560 --> 01:35:13.600]   The nice thing about this is you don't have to work with Apple.
[01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:14.960]   You can have QNIX running your car.
[01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:16.320]   You can have, yeah, it's just an airplay.
[01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:18.640]   It's like it doesn't matter who's TV you make.
[01:35:18.640 --> 01:35:22.880]   As long as you switch, you include the technology for the Apple television in it, it can broadcast
[01:35:22.880 --> 01:35:23.880]   to that.
[01:35:23.880 --> 01:35:24.880]   >> I agree.
[01:35:24.880 --> 01:35:30.360]   >> I do think there's a lot of people that would prefer not to, I think there's a lot
[01:35:30.360 --> 01:35:34.240]   of people that would just prefer an iOS or an Android or whatever, but I think you have
[01:35:34.240 --> 01:35:35.240]   to decide what your market is.
[01:35:35.240 --> 01:35:38.240]   >> You also have the issue of liability and distractibility.
[01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:42.000]   If you let a third party change the user interfaces in the car, then I think you have
[01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:43.440]   liability issues as well.
[01:35:43.440 --> 01:35:46.240]   >> Well, I mean, the ones that are in there right now aren't that great.
[01:35:46.240 --> 01:35:47.240]   >> They're terrible.
[01:35:47.240 --> 01:35:49.400]   >> Right, there's so many cars where it's like touchscreen based.
[01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:50.400]   >> Oh, yeah.
[01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:51.400]   >> Everything's on touchscreen.
[01:35:51.400 --> 01:35:52.880]   >> Ford finally got what he'd be doing while driving.
[01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:56.120]   My Ford Touch was a terrible idea.
[01:35:56.120 --> 01:36:01.200]   You hit the nail on the head down when you said they don't have any expertise in UI.
[01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:04.120]   >> And you carry your phone with you all the time.
[01:36:04.120 --> 01:36:05.920]   Anyway, it's your environment, all the stuff that you want.
[01:36:05.920 --> 01:36:09.400]   It has your music, it has your apps and the ability just to have that brain.
[01:36:09.400 --> 01:36:13.400]   A lot of companies have spoken about the smart box being in your pocket and projecting
[01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:15.160]   to all different sorts of interfaces.
[01:36:15.160 --> 01:36:16.640]   But this is where we start to see that.
[01:36:16.640 --> 01:36:20.800]   You just have your one thing and where you go, that thing takes whatever form it needs
[01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:21.800]   to take.
[01:36:21.800 --> 01:36:23.680]   >> I think it's very reluctant because I think of the law.
[01:36:23.680 --> 01:36:27.880]   Of course, there's a huge legislative backlash now on distracted driving.
[01:36:27.880 --> 01:36:32.200]   I think that anything that would in any way make the manufacturers more liable in that
[01:36:32.200 --> 01:36:34.680]   regard, they're going to be very sensitive to.
[01:36:34.680 --> 01:36:36.440]   >> Ferrari's doing it, Leo.
[01:36:36.440 --> 01:36:38.440]   Yeah, all right, good.
[01:36:38.440 --> 01:36:41.160]   >> Well, the liability on Ferrari is already so big.
[01:36:41.160 --> 01:36:43.800]   You've got a spike in the middle of the dashboard.
[01:36:43.800 --> 01:36:49.560]   I mean, it's going to be that much more dangerous.
[01:36:49.560 --> 01:36:53.160]   >> What else does Ferrari do that full led iOS takeover?
[01:36:53.160 --> 01:36:56.360]   >> Well, they put up a big slide of all different manufacturers.
[01:36:56.360 --> 01:36:57.840]   We're going to do iOS in the car.
[01:36:57.840 --> 01:36:58.840]   I forget how many.
[01:36:58.840 --> 01:37:01.120]   They were 9 or 12 in that grid.
[01:37:01.120 --> 01:37:02.120]   >> It was about a dozen.
[01:37:02.120 --> 01:37:03.120]   >> Yeah.
[01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:04.360]   It's an interesting bunch.
[01:37:04.360 --> 01:37:05.360]   >> Yeah.
[01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:08.360]   What Ford decided is we're going to go back to physical buttons.
[01:37:08.360 --> 01:37:09.360]   >> Well, yeah.
[01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:10.880]   >> I think that's smart.
[01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:13.200]   I think there's a usability.
[01:37:13.200 --> 01:37:14.840]   It's time tested, right?
[01:37:14.840 --> 01:37:18.560]   People have been using actual buttons for a long time and they work pretty well.
[01:37:18.560 --> 01:37:25.520]   >> Yeah, I get in this Audi and there's too many snobs and switches and Mercedes even
[01:37:25.520 --> 01:37:26.520]   worse.
[01:37:26.520 --> 01:37:27.520]   >> Yeah.
[01:37:27.520 --> 01:37:29.080]   >> And so I don't know.
[01:37:29.080 --> 01:37:32.400]   It's a tough thing to solve because consumers clearly want this, right?
[01:37:32.400 --> 01:37:35.040]   We want to get, we want our stuff.
[01:37:35.040 --> 01:37:36.440]   >> That launch button is so annoying, Leo.
[01:37:36.440 --> 01:37:42.560]   You press it and suddenly you're drag racing.
[01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:50.920]   >> So just real quickly on iWork, Mark Gurman writing at 9 to 5 Mac, guesses that perhaps
[01:37:50.920 --> 01:37:59.240]   Apple's next step is to make iWork kind of freely a part of iOS.
[01:37:59.240 --> 01:38:00.240]   Free services.
[01:38:00.240 --> 01:38:01.240]   You think?
[01:38:01.240 --> 01:38:02.240]   I mean, I have to say.
[01:38:02.240 --> 01:38:04.520]   >> I don't think they make that much money off it.
[01:38:04.520 --> 01:38:09.920]   And having it as a buy-in that you can get just like with iLife, iPhoto and iTunes and
[01:38:09.920 --> 01:38:13.560]   all that stuff, if you can get that free, why not?
[01:38:13.560 --> 01:38:17.680]   It just encourages more and more people to use Apple software and to buy into their services.
[01:38:17.680 --> 01:38:18.920]   It'll work great with iCloud.
[01:38:18.920 --> 01:38:20.480]   People are already getting iCloud for free.
[01:38:20.480 --> 01:38:24.000]   I mean, Google can offer docs for free them.
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:25.000]   Why not?
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:26.000]   >> Look, look.
[01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:27.000]   >> I work for free.
[01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:28.000]   >> Look at this.
[01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:29.000]   This is keynote in iCloud.
[01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.680]   I mean, it's pretty much the same as keynote anywhere else.
[01:38:31.680 --> 01:38:34.320]   This is coming straight off the web with HTML5 and Safari.
[01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:35.520]   >> It's really nicely done.
[01:38:35.520 --> 01:38:37.240]   >> It is pretty amazing.
[01:38:37.240 --> 01:38:40.000]   >> How fast it is.
[01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:45.040]   I mean, I think there was some leaks today showing the free downloads now include the
[01:38:45.040 --> 01:38:47.640]   iWork apps and some of the beta strings.
[01:38:47.640 --> 01:38:49.920]   >> Interesting.
[01:38:49.920 --> 01:38:55.040]   It's kind of interesting that $250 Samsung Chromebook now is an interesting and very useful
[01:38:55.040 --> 01:38:57.560]   entry point into iWork in iOS.
[01:38:57.560 --> 01:38:58.560]   >> Yeah.
[01:38:58.560 --> 01:38:59.560]   >> Wow.
[01:38:59.560 --> 01:39:00.560]   Do you think that's the intent?
[01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:01.560]   >> Do you think that's the intent?
[01:39:01.560 --> 01:39:04.600]   >> And it gets them off of the best paid apps list, which is nice for developers.
[01:39:04.600 --> 01:39:05.600]   >> Yeah, right.
[01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:06.600]   Three slots open.
[01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:10.440]   >> And the only thing the developers have to give up is that, oh, by the way, it's now
[01:39:10.440 --> 01:39:13.480]   impossible to sell any kind of a text editor or any kind of program.
[01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:14.920]   >> Well, I mean, Google and library kind of work.
[01:39:14.920 --> 01:39:17.640]   >> The other two popular ones anyway, so I'm sure Apple is not morning quick.
[01:39:17.640 --> 01:39:20.840]   What was a quick office and a document stick, oh, being off the list.
[01:39:20.840 --> 01:39:25.120]   >> Yeah, but remember that the reason why you haven't really seen any good competitors
[01:39:25.120 --> 01:39:30.280]   is that Apple has never given developers good tools for text editing for writing your
[01:39:30.280 --> 01:39:31.280]   own third party apps.
[01:39:31.280 --> 01:39:34.720]   >> There are a ton of third party text editors, though, and several of them are very good.
[01:39:34.720 --> 01:39:37.960]   So long as you don't do anything tricky like boldface.
[01:39:37.960 --> 01:39:39.880]   >> Or trying to use iCloud to save.
[01:39:39.880 --> 01:39:43.560]   >> I mean, a lot of them use Dropbox, for example.
[01:39:43.560 --> 01:39:49.160]   >> Almost, it's like there are a million plain text editors that use Markdown.
[01:39:49.160 --> 01:39:53.360]   But it's hard to name more than two or three of them.
[01:39:53.360 --> 01:39:55.040]   >> They have to use them themselves, right?
[01:39:55.040 --> 01:39:56.400]   >> Yeah, I mean, exactly.
[01:39:56.400 --> 01:40:00.320]   I've been talking to some of these developers and they gave, they were holding up hope for
[01:40:00.320 --> 01:40:04.360]   iOS 6 and when iOS 6 came out, they said, okay, Apple's never going to give us these
[01:40:04.360 --> 01:40:07.680]   tools, we're going to have to build our own APIs for this.
[01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:12.040]   And now that they have new text engines in iOS 7, I think we're going to see some cool
[01:40:12.040 --> 01:40:13.040]   stuff.
[01:40:13.040 --> 01:40:18.200]   I mean, fortunately, literature and latte has started distributing screen, showing off
[01:40:18.200 --> 01:40:22.160]   the screenshots from the iOS version of Scrivener.
[01:40:22.160 --> 01:40:24.240]   And I can't wait to see how that turns out.
[01:40:24.240 --> 01:40:26.360]   >> Yeah, even working on that for a long time.
[01:40:26.360 --> 01:40:31.280]   >> And yeah, just from the screenshots alone, it looks like it could be one of the greatest
[01:40:31.280 --> 01:40:34.080]   tablet apps ever made for any platform under any search.
[01:40:34.080 --> 01:40:36.000]   >> They stole the iMore app developer to do that.
[01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:37.200]   Tammy Karanch is amazing.
[01:40:37.200 --> 01:40:38.200]   >> Yeah.
[01:40:38.200 --> 01:40:42.800]   >> But on the flip side of that, the spreadsheet and presentation software has never really
[01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:45.400]   been a huge market for third parties on iOS.
[01:40:45.400 --> 01:40:49.920]   I mean, there's not a lot of huge competitors, especially because keynote and numbers actually
[01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:52.240]   work really, really well on iOS.
[01:40:52.240 --> 01:40:57.440]   >> Yeah, which makes you, but it does make you ask, like should these are all awesome
[01:40:57.440 --> 01:41:02.080]   apps and they're almost certainly best in class for mobile right now.
[01:41:02.080 --> 01:41:07.360]   That is Apple doing a great job by saying we're going to make it really tough to, we're going
[01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:11.400]   to make it really hard for anybody to put the investment into make a great word process
[01:41:11.400 --> 01:41:17.400]   or make a great presentation app because we're going to use inside knowledge to build our
[01:41:17.400 --> 01:41:20.600]   own version of this that kicks butt and costs about 18 cents.
[01:41:20.600 --> 01:41:23.600]   >> Well, but you could say the same thing about the web browser market, right?
[01:41:23.600 --> 01:41:24.600]   >> Right, the mail.
[01:41:24.600 --> 01:41:25.600]   >> It'll plug out.
[01:41:25.600 --> 01:41:26.600]   >> It'll make one.
[01:41:26.600 --> 01:41:29.920]   >> Yeah, I mean, mobile Safari is not really, there's almost nothing that's competitive to
[01:41:29.920 --> 01:41:30.920]   it.
[01:41:30.920 --> 01:41:33.520]   It's not really good to get its Chrome, but it's still required to use the same rendering
[01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:38.480]   engine and they can't use all the nifty, you know, Nitro.js and all that stuff that Safari
[01:41:38.480 --> 01:41:39.480]   uses.
[01:41:39.480 --> 01:41:43.200]   So it depends on whether you consider productivity of like the word process or kind of sort of
[01:41:43.200 --> 01:41:47.280]   core functionality that should be in the iOS period.
[01:41:47.280 --> 01:41:49.280]   >> That collaboration.
[01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:53.560]   >> Well, Microsoft to Polygo with compatibility is their killer feature.
[01:41:53.560 --> 01:41:58.400]   >> I mean, I feel like there's nothing we can really use seriously unless we can have
[01:41:58.400 --> 01:42:00.480]   five people working on at the same time.
[01:42:00.480 --> 01:42:04.360]   You know, you're going to really like the new typographic engine in iOS 7.
[01:42:04.360 --> 01:42:09.360]   Good article by, just in German, unfortunately, you're going to see Bert and Maurice Moller
[01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:14.120]   from the German font blog translated though on typographic and highly recommended.
[01:42:14.120 --> 01:42:18.040]   One of the things they talk about, they say you may not like the, you know, Helvetica
[01:42:18.040 --> 01:42:25.480]   new ultra light font, but don't worry because the iOS 7 font engine has completely redesigned
[01:42:25.480 --> 01:42:31.320]   and has some amazing typographic characters as the first mobile device with real typographic
[01:42:31.320 --> 01:42:33.800]   control for developers.
[01:42:33.800 --> 01:42:35.800]   They call it dynamic type.
[01:42:35.800 --> 01:42:40.720]   It will be the first electronic device that will by default consider a quality of type
[01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:43.800]   that hasn't been given so much attention to the age of letter press.
[01:42:43.800 --> 01:42:51.320]   And this is a font designer talking, operating system level typographic control.
[01:42:51.320 --> 01:42:55.120]   So maybe you don't like, I don't like the ultra thin Helvetica.
[01:42:55.120 --> 01:42:57.720]   But that's not all you're going to see.
[01:42:57.720 --> 01:43:02.560]   Users can now use sliders with seven stops, settings, general text size to adjust the
[01:43:02.560 --> 01:43:07.200]   text size in every app, according to their own taste.
[01:43:07.200 --> 01:43:11.000]   You have lots more control and developers even more importantly will have a ton of control
[01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:12.000]   over this.
[01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:13.000]   So interesting article.
[01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:14.520]   So if you screwed up, it'll be all your fault.
[01:43:14.520 --> 01:43:15.520]   You can't, you can't.
[01:43:15.520 --> 01:43:18.000]   Developers is your fault.
[01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:22.040]   Sad to note, we mentioned it on Twitter, of course, but Doug Gengelbart, the designer
[01:43:22.040 --> 01:43:26.680]   of the computer mouse and the man who really made modern computing possible has passed
[01:43:26.680 --> 01:43:29.400]   away at the age of 88.
[01:43:29.400 --> 01:43:31.720]   Quite a legend, quite an amazing fellow at SRI.
[01:43:31.720 --> 01:43:38.040]   He showed the, he had the, what was it, the mother of all demos in 1968 where he showed
[01:43:38.040 --> 01:43:42.000]   according keyboard, a mouse, wind, I mean, just all this stuff.
[01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:45.000]   And really kind of a predecessor to modern computing.
[01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:46.000]   Brilliant.
[01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:51.080]   You should definitely see that video because I've shared that link with so many people
[01:43:51.080 --> 01:43:52.600]   over the years.
[01:43:52.600 --> 01:43:56.280]   And there's always a one in six chance on me, me back.
[01:43:56.280 --> 01:43:57.520]   So, oh, that's, that's fine.
[01:43:57.520 --> 01:43:58.920]   I could tell it was a fake.
[01:43:58.920 --> 01:44:02.120]   He had me up until the point where they started talking about collaborative document editing.
[01:44:02.120 --> 01:44:06.920]   And I knew this was, because there wasn't, there wasn't like a photo making the rounds
[01:44:06.920 --> 01:44:10.440]   about the 1957 image of what computers would be like in 2000.
[01:44:10.440 --> 01:44:11.440]   Right.
[01:44:11.440 --> 01:44:12.440]   And of course, it was a Photoshop together.
[01:44:12.440 --> 01:44:13.440]   It's fake.
[01:44:13.440 --> 01:44:14.440]   Yeah.
[01:44:14.440 --> 01:44:16.360]   Like, no, this was actually, he was actually doing all that stuff.
[01:44:16.360 --> 01:44:18.440]   Not only that, but he actually was demonstrating it working.
[01:44:18.440 --> 01:44:20.680]   It was live in real time.
[01:44:20.680 --> 01:44:21.680]   Yeah.
[01:44:21.680 --> 01:44:23.280]   With Bill English behind the scenes.
[01:44:23.280 --> 01:44:26.080]   Just an amazing, amazing thing.
[01:44:26.080 --> 01:44:31.000]   And everybody's reports, one of the sweetest guys in the world.
[01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:32.000]   I did meet him briefly.
[01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.600]   We had him on the screen savers with his mouse.
[01:44:34.600 --> 01:44:36.120]   And I think his grandson brought him.
[01:44:36.120 --> 01:44:37.640]   It was a really wonderful moment.
[01:44:37.640 --> 01:44:43.800]   And he was a very warm and humble fella.
[01:44:43.800 --> 01:44:44.800]   So just a note.
[01:44:44.800 --> 01:44:47.760]   There's a little video from the mother of all demos.
[01:44:47.760 --> 01:44:50.520]   That's Doug Engelbart on the controls there.
[01:44:50.520 --> 01:44:52.120]   See, another great innovation.
[01:44:52.120 --> 01:44:55.200]   If you put your beverage on one of those wells and you spill it, it doesn't get into your
[01:44:55.200 --> 01:44:56.200]   keyboard.
[01:44:56.200 --> 01:45:03.200]   We have to remember in 1968, with a state of computing was having a screen by itself was
[01:45:03.200 --> 01:45:05.160]   an amazing thing.
[01:45:05.160 --> 01:45:06.480]   Your computer didn't fill a room.
[01:45:06.480 --> 01:45:07.480]   That was pretty great.
[01:45:07.480 --> 01:45:08.480]   Yeah.
[01:45:08.480 --> 01:45:09.480]   Right.
[01:45:09.480 --> 01:45:10.480]   All right.
[01:45:10.480 --> 01:45:11.480]   We're going to take a break.
[01:45:11.480 --> 01:45:13.560]   Come back with your picks of the week.
[01:45:13.560 --> 01:45:17.840]   But first a word from our friends at Squarespace, the place to get not only the best web hosting
[01:45:17.840 --> 01:45:21.240]   in the business, but the best content management system.
[01:45:21.240 --> 01:45:22.920]   Boy, we've come a long way.
[01:45:22.920 --> 01:45:27.160]   You got to think somebody like Doug Engelbart looking at this in the guy who really invented
[01:45:27.160 --> 01:45:32.680]   hypertext looking at what the web has become, the power of the web, the beauty of these
[01:45:32.680 --> 01:45:37.760]   templates, the flexibility, the ability that you can have a great looking website without
[01:45:37.760 --> 01:45:40.200]   being a coder, without being a programmer.
[01:45:40.200 --> 01:45:41.200]   But it's all yours.
[01:45:41.200 --> 01:45:42.400]   It's customized.
[01:45:42.400 --> 01:45:49.600]   That's exactly what you want, your domain, your social network.
[01:45:49.600 --> 01:45:50.600]   Go to squarespace.com.
[01:45:50.600 --> 01:45:52.280]   Click the Get Started button.
[01:45:52.280 --> 01:45:54.680]   And you can start today for free.
[01:45:54.680 --> 01:45:56.920]   You don't have to give them a credit card.
[01:45:56.920 --> 01:46:00.720]   Just sign up and you've got two weeks, the run of the place.
[01:46:00.720 --> 01:46:01.720]   See what it'll do.
[01:46:01.720 --> 01:46:03.200]   Import your content from your existing site.
[01:46:03.200 --> 01:46:04.520]   It'll do that.
[01:46:04.520 --> 01:46:05.520]   The templates are fabulous.
[01:46:05.520 --> 01:46:10.800]   They've got designers working all the time to add new features, new templates, the latest
[01:46:10.800 --> 01:46:15.960]   this momentum template we've talked about before, a full bleed design, particularly
[01:46:15.960 --> 01:46:20.640]   for photographers and designers who want to just make a beautiful website.
[01:46:20.640 --> 01:46:22.200]   These are all based on the momentum.
[01:46:22.200 --> 01:46:24.000]   This is the other thing I like.
[01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:29.600]   Once you pick a template, you design it and you're going to make it yours.
[01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:33.040]   So many web design tools, they all look the same.
[01:46:33.040 --> 01:46:34.040]   This is unique.
[01:46:34.040 --> 01:46:35.040]   This is your style.
[01:46:35.040 --> 01:46:41.000]   It's why artists, people with real design sense of taste, love squarespace.
[01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:42.000]   And it looks great.
[01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:43.000]   And it'll crash it.
[01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:44.000]   I mean, we just--
[01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:52.800]   I just did a live event where there was a lot of A list, folks, and the person that
[01:46:52.800 --> 01:46:54.880]   the people's website went down really quickly.
[01:46:54.880 --> 01:46:55.880]   Isn't that embarrassing?
[01:46:55.880 --> 01:46:56.880]   Isn't that embarrassing?
[01:46:56.880 --> 01:47:01.240]   You just really want to-- it's important.
[01:47:01.240 --> 01:47:03.160]   If you think you're going to do something that's going to be big.
[01:47:03.160 --> 01:47:05.520]   If you're going to do something small, it's not hard to put together and it's not very
[01:47:05.520 --> 01:47:06.520]   expensive.
[01:47:06.520 --> 01:47:08.520]   And if you're going to do something big, you know that you can scale with it.
[01:47:08.520 --> 01:47:09.520]   I think it's important.
[01:47:09.520 --> 01:47:11.240]   And of course, the price is right.
[01:47:11.240 --> 01:47:13.560]   They do have commerce now, which is fantastic.
[01:47:13.560 --> 01:47:17.000]   Once you've tried it for two weeks, if you decide you want to buy, take a look at the
[01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:18.000]   pricing.
[01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:19.480]   $16 the most popular plan.
[01:47:19.480 --> 01:47:23.680]   That $16 a month when you are billed annually, you can go month to month if you want.
[01:47:23.680 --> 01:47:26.120]   $20 a month, still a very good fee.
[01:47:26.120 --> 01:47:31.320]   Considering you get unlimited pages, unlimited galleries and blogs, unlimited-- for that price,
[01:47:31.320 --> 01:47:32.320]   unlimited bandwidth.
[01:47:32.320 --> 01:47:35.680]   You'll never get a bandwidth bill, even if you become the most popular site on the internet.
[01:47:35.680 --> 01:47:37.880]   Unlimited storage, unlimited contributors.
[01:47:37.880 --> 01:47:42.000]   When you sign up for a year plan, they will give you a custom domain free and hook it
[01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:43.200]   all up for you.
[01:47:43.200 --> 01:47:48.680]   If you want to do commerce, unlimited digital or physical products, a mobile store, inventory
[01:47:48.680 --> 01:47:52.840]   tracking, they do the tax, they do shipping, you have coupon control, that's 24 bucks a
[01:47:52.840 --> 01:47:54.200]   month.
[01:47:54.200 --> 01:47:57.400]   And better yet, we're going to take 10% off your first purchase with a new account when
[01:47:57.400 --> 01:48:01.560]   you go to squarespace.com and use our offer code MACBreak7.

[01:48:03.560 --> 01:48:04.560]   You don't need an offer code to try it free.
[01:48:04.560 --> 01:48:09.000]   But if you decide to buy, offer code MACBreak7 gets you 10% off that first purchase on a
[01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:10.480]   new account.

[01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:13.000]   We love Squarespace.
[01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:14.000]   We know you will too.
[01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:15.000]   Squarespace.com.
[01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:20.320]   I want to thank them for their support of MACBreak Weekly and actually podcasts all over
[01:48:20.320 --> 01:48:21.320]   the world.
[01:48:21.320 --> 01:48:23.840]   They believe in new media.
[01:48:23.840 --> 01:48:27.160]   They are a new media company and I'm very grateful to them for it.
[01:48:27.160 --> 01:48:31.640]   And for our picks of the week, I don't know, Dan, if you were warned.
[01:48:31.640 --> 01:48:32.640]   I was warned.
[01:48:32.640 --> 01:48:34.640]   Were you prepped?
[01:48:34.640 --> 01:48:37.200]   What would you like to tell the world about this week?
[01:48:37.200 --> 01:48:42.320]   Well, I recently, for a while, I had both internet and digital voice through Comcast.
[01:48:42.320 --> 01:48:45.880]   Here's my local ISP and I decided I wanted to get rid of the digital voice.
[01:48:45.880 --> 01:48:49.280]   But I like having a landline because my cell phone signal really kind of is crappy in my
[01:48:49.280 --> 01:48:50.840]   apartment.
[01:48:50.840 --> 01:48:55.160]   So I came across a friend recommended to me this company, Obie High.
[01:48:55.160 --> 01:48:57.160]   Oh, I love the Obie High.
[01:48:57.160 --> 01:48:58.160]   Yeah.
[01:48:58.160 --> 01:49:02.200]   So I got this little Obie 100, which is just a little box, plugs into your router with
[01:49:02.200 --> 01:49:06.560]   an ethernet cable and then plugs into any phone with a standard phone cable.
[01:49:06.560 --> 01:49:08.000]   And you can now route everything.
[01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.360]   I mean, it's cool because they give you, they have their own VoIP service, which is
[01:49:10.360 --> 01:49:11.360]   fine.
[01:49:11.360 --> 01:49:14.120]   But now you can actually route Google Voice.
[01:49:14.120 --> 01:49:15.120]   That's what I do.
[01:49:15.120 --> 01:49:21.400]   The voice over this, which is great because it's just, it's free, essentially VoIP landline
[01:49:21.400 --> 01:49:23.760]   service to my house.
[01:49:23.760 --> 01:49:24.960]   And it works seamlessly.
[01:49:24.960 --> 01:49:28.800]   I just, you plug it in, you go through, like, put in your Google credentials.
[01:49:28.800 --> 01:49:30.040]   And it's basically, you're done.
[01:49:30.040 --> 01:49:31.800]   You don't ever have to think about it again.
[01:49:31.800 --> 01:49:33.640]   So I hooked it up a couple of weeks ago.
[01:49:33.640 --> 01:49:36.440]   And it's great because it's been, you know, it's my Google voice number.
[01:49:36.440 --> 01:49:38.800]   So it rings that and my iPhone.
[01:49:38.800 --> 01:49:41.400]   And then wherever I am, I can pick up the right one.
[01:49:41.400 --> 01:49:44.880]   And it lets me, it's great for things, especially I find where, you know, I don't want to have
[01:49:44.880 --> 01:49:48.520]   my cell phone to do, say, an interview or something because I'm worried it's going to
[01:49:48.520 --> 01:49:51.080]   just break up or I'm going to lose my signal.
[01:49:51.080 --> 01:49:54.240]   But so far it's been, it's been bulletproof and great.
[01:49:54.240 --> 01:49:55.240]   And it's pretty cheap.
[01:49:55.240 --> 01:49:56.520]   Yeah, 40 bucks, right?
[01:49:56.520 --> 01:49:58.640]   Like, and you don't have to pay for the service at all.
[01:49:58.640 --> 01:50:01.400]   So it's, that's basically just that one time $40 outlay.
[01:50:01.400 --> 01:50:06.000]   And so I'm saving like, you know, $10 a month that I was spending on digital voice service.
[01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:09.200]   It's basically, yeah, I mean, that's my home phone.
[01:50:09.200 --> 01:50:12.800]   I put it on a cordless base station of cordless phones around the house and I'm done.
[01:50:12.800 --> 01:50:13.800]   And it's free.
[01:50:13.800 --> 01:50:14.800]   It's great.
[01:50:14.800 --> 01:50:19.240]   I cannot recommend it highly enough having, having used it now for, for several weeks.
[01:50:19.240 --> 01:50:20.240]   Yeah.
[01:50:20.240 --> 01:50:22.400]   I've had it for more than a year.
[01:50:22.400 --> 01:50:23.400]   Obe.
[01:50:23.400 --> 01:50:25.040]   I'm going to be, HCI.com.
[01:50:25.040 --> 01:50:27.080]   Yeah, it's really cool.
[01:50:27.080 --> 01:50:29.680]   The Obe 140 bucks.
[01:50:29.680 --> 01:50:30.680]   Good, good.
[01:50:30.680 --> 01:50:31.680]   Thank you.
[01:50:31.680 --> 01:50:32.680]   Thanks.
[01:50:32.680 --> 01:50:34.520]   Renee Ritchie, your pick of the week.
[01:50:34.520 --> 01:50:38.840]   My pick of the week is, I guess they saw that Apple was doing the top, like the making
[01:50:38.840 --> 01:50:42.680]   five games free for the fifth anniversary and EA didn't get included in that and they felt
[01:50:42.680 --> 01:50:43.680]   kind of bad.
[01:50:43.680 --> 01:50:45.120]   So they wanted to give away some free stuff too.
[01:50:45.120 --> 01:50:49.240]   So they made mirrors edge, dead space and Sims medieval free.
[01:50:49.240 --> 01:50:50.960]   I don't know for how long it will last.
[01:50:50.960 --> 01:50:52.720]   They're free today.
[01:50:52.720 --> 01:50:54.840]   The other is edge came out with the original iPad.
[01:50:54.840 --> 01:50:59.280]   Very nice swipe based game, dead space, incredibly atmospheric.
[01:50:59.280 --> 01:51:04.280]   It's one of those space Hulk type games where you're stuck in a derelict demonic spaceship
[01:51:04.280 --> 01:51:05.760]   and you got to fight your way through.
[01:51:05.760 --> 01:51:06.760]   Oh, you're one of those.
[01:51:06.760 --> 01:51:07.760]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:51:07.760 --> 01:51:10.440]   I mean, they're a whole, they're basically a John into themselves.
[01:51:10.440 --> 01:51:13.400]   They were in it Thursday in Boston.
[01:51:13.400 --> 01:51:14.800]   Yeah, no, absolutely.
[01:51:14.800 --> 01:51:17.680]   So all three of those games, they're not the newest games, you know, just like the games
[01:51:17.680 --> 01:51:20.600]   that are available for Apple's fifth anniversary, aren't the newest games, but there's some
[01:51:20.600 --> 01:51:22.240]   classic games, there's some excellent games.
[01:51:22.240 --> 01:51:26.120]   And if you haven't tried them already, you can get them for free right now.
[01:51:26.120 --> 01:51:28.120]   Cool.
[01:51:28.120 --> 01:51:30.120]   Cool, cool, cool.
[01:51:30.120 --> 01:51:31.840]   Mr. Alex Lindsey, pick it a week.
[01:51:31.840 --> 01:51:32.840]   I've got two things.
[01:51:32.840 --> 01:51:34.640]   Ooh, just little things.
[01:51:34.640 --> 01:51:35.640]   Aren't you fancy?
[01:51:35.640 --> 01:51:36.640]   Just little.
[01:51:36.640 --> 01:51:38.640]   So number one is.
[01:51:38.640 --> 01:51:39.640]   I just dropped it.
[01:51:39.640 --> 01:51:40.640]   It was on the ground.
[01:51:40.640 --> 01:51:41.640]   So it's there.
[01:51:41.640 --> 01:51:43.400]   It's very drop resistant though.
[01:51:43.400 --> 01:51:44.400]   Yes, it is.
[01:51:44.400 --> 01:51:45.920]   It's a gravity sensor.
[01:51:45.920 --> 01:51:46.920]   Exactly.
[01:51:46.920 --> 01:51:47.920]   You can drop this.
[01:51:47.920 --> 01:51:49.560]   This is the Mophie power station.
[01:51:49.560 --> 01:51:50.560]   Ooh.
[01:51:50.560 --> 01:51:51.560]   It's rubberized.
[01:51:51.560 --> 01:51:52.560]   Yeah, it's running me to the power station.
[01:51:52.560 --> 01:51:54.880]   You're going to hold it for the close up camera?
[01:51:54.880 --> 01:51:55.880]   There you go.
[01:51:55.880 --> 01:51:56.880]   It's so nice looking.
[01:51:56.880 --> 01:51:57.880]   It looks so well made.
[01:51:57.880 --> 01:51:58.880]   I have a couple of these.
[01:51:58.880 --> 01:51:59.880]   Look at that.
[01:51:59.880 --> 01:52:05.320]   So this thing, that is essentially, yeah, you can bang it around a little bit.
[01:52:05.320 --> 01:52:09.360]   So that is about two whole, you know, iPhone charges.
[01:52:09.360 --> 01:52:11.880]   And I just don't go anywhere without it.
[01:52:11.880 --> 01:52:12.880]   Here's a little one.
[01:52:12.880 --> 01:52:13.880]   Here's a little one.
[01:52:13.880 --> 01:52:14.880]   Oh, these got a little one.
[01:52:14.880 --> 01:52:15.880]   I keep two of them.
[01:52:15.880 --> 01:52:16.880]   So this is a single charge.
[01:52:16.880 --> 01:52:17.880]   I travel a lot.
[01:52:17.880 --> 01:52:18.880]   So I have the cases.
[01:52:18.880 --> 01:52:21.520]   The cases don't, the problem with the Mophie cases, they don't last very long.
[01:52:21.520 --> 01:52:23.280]   They're like a half a charge or something.
[01:52:23.280 --> 01:52:24.280]   Yeah.
[01:52:24.280 --> 01:52:25.280]   They're wimpy.
[01:52:25.280 --> 01:52:26.920]   And so I keep these as kind of backups.
[01:52:26.920 --> 01:52:28.400]   I don't use them every day.
[01:52:28.400 --> 01:52:31.200]   They're just kind of sitting in my backpack.
[01:52:31.200 --> 01:52:34.960]   But I got to tell you, there are times, you know, you're in the middle of, you know, South
[01:52:34.960 --> 01:52:40.320]   Africa, and you suddenly lose connection and you need to sort things out.
[01:52:40.320 --> 01:52:41.680]   And these are great.
[01:52:41.680 --> 01:52:44.040]   So you know, they're just great to have there.
[01:52:44.040 --> 01:52:48.560]   They'll charge up your iPad, your iPhone, and it's just, or anything else.
[01:52:48.560 --> 01:52:52.680]   So like one of the other things that I use this for a lot is I'll take the smaller one
[01:52:52.680 --> 01:52:56.400]   and I hook it to my Mophie and I put it in my backpack when I'm traveling.
[01:52:56.400 --> 01:52:57.400]   And then I just leave it there.
[01:52:57.400 --> 01:52:58.400]   It'll run all day.
[01:52:58.400 --> 01:52:59.400]   Oh yeah.
[01:52:59.400 --> 01:53:01.240]   It'll just run the Mophie because the Mophie itself only lasts two and a half hours.
[01:53:01.240 --> 01:53:05.720]   You hook it to one of these guys and it'll give you your own personal Wi-Fi space, you
[01:53:05.720 --> 01:53:08.040]   know, for the entire day.
[01:53:08.040 --> 01:53:13.520]   And so it's a great way to kind of keep anything that's USB, chargeable, you know, out there.
[01:53:13.520 --> 01:53:19.200]   And it has saved my Tuckus many times.
[01:53:19.200 --> 01:53:22.160]   Tuckus saved many, many times.
[01:53:22.160 --> 01:53:25.040]   So I felt like it was worth recommending.
[01:53:25.040 --> 01:53:28.160]   I've had it for, you know, probably a year now.
[01:53:28.160 --> 01:53:33.720]   And you know, I was talking about the HTC One, which like the iPhone 5 doesn't have a replaceable
[01:53:33.720 --> 01:53:35.120]   battery.
[01:53:35.120 --> 01:53:36.280]   And I was yelled at.
[01:53:36.280 --> 01:53:38.240]   I can't remember who I'm by.
[01:53:38.240 --> 01:53:39.240]   Twitter.
[01:53:39.240 --> 01:53:40.240]   Twitter probably.
[01:53:40.240 --> 01:53:41.240]   They yell at me all the time.
[01:53:41.240 --> 01:53:42.240]   Twitter is saying loud.
[01:53:42.240 --> 01:53:46.880]   Just take it, take a battery with you and then you don't need an external battery.
[01:53:46.880 --> 01:53:47.880]   And that's a good point.
[01:53:47.880 --> 01:53:50.800]   This is like an external, you know, but I always have an extra pocket.
[01:53:50.800 --> 01:53:51.800]   I always have an extra battery.
[01:53:51.800 --> 01:53:54.880]   But I guess what I'd say is that I, this is an external battery for anything that uses
[01:53:54.880 --> 01:53:55.880]   USB.
[01:53:55.880 --> 01:53:56.880]   Right.
[01:53:56.880 --> 01:53:57.880]   It's not, it's not just for your iPad or iPad or iPad.
[01:53:57.880 --> 01:54:00.600]   I carry this around, but this is only going to work for the Galaxy S more.
[01:54:00.600 --> 01:54:02.640]   I use the ones Alex uses to their fantastic.
[01:54:02.640 --> 01:54:04.240]   I take two of them with every trade show.
[01:54:04.240 --> 01:54:05.240]   Yep.
[01:54:05.240 --> 01:54:06.240]   They're bullet points.
[01:54:06.240 --> 01:54:07.920]   And it's anything that you have that needs to be powered by USB.
[01:54:07.920 --> 01:54:09.400]   You're plugging them into it and it just makes it much.
[01:54:09.400 --> 01:54:11.400]   My only concern would be you're making.
[01:54:11.400 --> 01:54:14.400]   I've been using Google Glass like lots and lots of places.
[01:54:14.400 --> 01:54:21.160]   I have, I have, I have, I found the, the thinnest like little micro USB wire that I have.
[01:54:21.160 --> 01:54:24.600]   And so I can simply walk around with it plugged in all day long and let this battery pack
[01:54:24.600 --> 01:54:25.600]   in my, in my pocket.
[01:54:25.600 --> 01:54:26.600]   And it's like, great.
[01:54:26.600 --> 01:54:28.360]   I've got nine hours worth of battery life on this.
[01:54:28.360 --> 01:54:29.360]   Awesome.
[01:54:29.360 --> 01:54:32.000]   My only concern that you might be paying more for that because of the brand now, how much
[01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:33.160]   is the, the Mophie?
[01:54:33.160 --> 01:54:34.160]   Yeah.
[01:54:34.160 --> 01:54:37.880]   Cause so, cause so here's what I use, which is not as cool a name.
[01:54:37.880 --> 01:54:40.080]   It's called the Jackery.
[01:54:40.080 --> 01:54:43.680]   But it's a 10,400 milliamp hours for 50 bucks.
[01:54:43.680 --> 01:54:46.400]   Can I ask you a capacity on the Mophie?
[01:54:46.400 --> 01:54:47.400]   It's not that much.
[01:54:47.400 --> 01:54:48.400]   It's 6,000.
[01:54:48.400 --> 01:54:49.400]   Yeah.
[01:54:49.400 --> 01:54:50.600]   And this has a fast charging port.
[01:54:50.600 --> 01:54:52.280]   It has a 1.2 amp.
[01:54:52.280 --> 01:54:53.600]   I do think, I don't know if you're.
[01:54:53.600 --> 01:54:54.600]   For what I think.
[01:54:54.600 --> 01:54:57.200]   I think that the power station is actually a fast charging.
[01:54:57.200 --> 01:54:59.080]   I don't know for that for sure, but it seems to charge.
[01:54:59.080 --> 01:55:00.080]   And this is orange.
[01:55:00.080 --> 01:55:03.320]   And you're saying that's a flashlight.
[01:55:03.320 --> 01:55:04.320]   And that's a feature.
[01:55:04.320 --> 01:55:05.320]   Yeah.
[01:55:05.320 --> 01:55:06.840]   You can have it's Homer Simpson's battery.
[01:55:06.840 --> 01:55:09.880]   It doesn't have the, it doesn't have the, but I'm just saying I agree with you in the
[01:55:09.880 --> 01:55:12.560]   principle and I just don't know if Mophie is the only way to go.
[01:55:12.560 --> 01:55:13.560]   No, no, no, no.
[01:55:13.560 --> 01:55:14.560]   Other similar products.
[01:55:14.560 --> 01:55:15.560]   I really like that one.
[01:55:15.560 --> 01:55:16.560]   That's the one that I have.
[01:55:16.560 --> 01:55:21.520]   It's boys that, but I have to say that, and it's, it's really stand, you know, I've used
[01:55:21.520 --> 01:55:23.520]   it a lot and bang it around a lot.
[01:55:23.520 --> 01:55:25.640]   And then you see I just dropped it on the show.
[01:55:25.640 --> 01:55:26.640]   Yeah.
[01:55:26.640 --> 01:55:29.840]   Anyway, so I, that's, that's the reason that I recommended it.
[01:55:29.840 --> 01:55:33.080]   But, but I think that get in external battery like that just makes sense to have in your
[01:55:33.080 --> 01:55:34.080]   backpack.
[01:55:34.080 --> 01:55:35.080]   I agree.
[01:55:35.080 --> 01:55:38.040]   When I travel, and this is enough by the way with 2.1 amps, I'm sure the Mophie is too.
[01:55:38.040 --> 01:55:39.040]   It's charging iPad, right?
[01:55:39.040 --> 01:55:40.440]   You can get 10 watts out of that.
[01:55:40.440 --> 01:55:41.920]   So, and that's the key.
[01:55:41.920 --> 01:55:45.560]   And, and you know, a lot of times I have, because what I basically carry, and I, again,
[01:55:45.560 --> 01:55:46.560]   I travel a lot.
[01:55:46.560 --> 01:55:49.560]   So it's a little bit of a special case, but I have two of the Mophie cases.
[01:55:49.560 --> 01:55:51.160]   And then I have that, those two.
[01:55:51.160 --> 01:55:54.800]   And that just means that I can run all day without worrying too much about it because
[01:55:54.800 --> 01:56:00.360]   there's nothing worse than being, you know, in an airport without being able to check
[01:56:00.360 --> 01:56:05.920]   your, you know, yeah, it's, it's, there's a, there's a certain, it's like being able to
[01:56:05.920 --> 01:56:07.420]   breathe underwater.
[01:56:07.420 --> 01:56:08.420]   Yeah.
[01:56:08.420 --> 01:56:11.160]   And when you're in an airport and you see that, where's the problem?
[01:56:11.160 --> 01:56:12.160]   I knew it out.
[01:56:12.160 --> 01:56:13.160]   Like, where's the problem?
[01:56:13.160 --> 01:56:14.160]   Like, I said, ah, yes.
[01:56:14.160 --> 01:56:16.840]   I remember a time when I cared about charging.
[01:56:16.840 --> 01:56:20.160]   I, that's, that's before I decided to bring my own electrons with me.
[01:56:20.160 --> 01:56:24.800]   So, actually, actually, I like to change my answer.
[01:56:24.800 --> 01:56:28.600]   It's sort of like that scene in the, the, the Michael Keaton Batman movie where the Joker
[01:56:28.600 --> 01:56:30.680]   is the only one in the art gallery who has the gap.
[01:56:30.680 --> 01:56:31.680]   Who has the oxygen mask?
[01:56:31.680 --> 01:56:35.320]   And it was like everybody else is going to, is going to be, is going to be gas to death
[01:56:35.320 --> 01:56:36.320]   and he is going to be okay.
[01:56:36.320 --> 01:56:37.320]   Yes.
[01:56:37.320 --> 01:56:38.320]   Your pick of the week, sir.
[01:56:38.320 --> 01:56:39.320]   Or did you have two?
[01:56:39.320 --> 01:56:40.320]   That's it.
[01:56:40.320 --> 01:56:41.320]   That's it.
[01:56:41.320 --> 01:56:42.320]   Yeah.
[01:56:42.320 --> 01:56:43.320]   Your pick of the week, sir.
[01:56:43.320 --> 01:56:44.320]   This, this is a fun one.
[01:56:44.320 --> 01:56:45.320]   It's called Pixie Tracker.
[01:56:45.320 --> 01:56:46.320]   It's two bucks.
[01:56:46.320 --> 01:56:49.740]   It is a simple like chip tune, like music app.
[01:56:49.740 --> 01:56:53.260]   And the, I mean, the, it's these, I mean, these things are just like fun as hell.
[01:56:53.260 --> 01:56:57.780]   It's not, it's not like just one of these apps out there, but it's like, it doesn't
[01:56:57.780 --> 01:57:02.320]   turn music into keys and notes and staffs and things like this.
[01:57:02.320 --> 01:57:06.660]   It turns it into the fun of like an old, a cheap Casio tone keyboard that you would
[01:57:06.660 --> 01:57:08.300]   just screw around with.
[01:57:08.300 --> 01:57:14.520]   And just simply by like placing like fat bits, picks elements on the scrolling thing, you'll
[01:57:14.520 --> 01:57:16.860]   start off by just saying, okay, well, just do a drum beat.
[01:57:16.860 --> 01:57:17.860]   Okay.
[01:57:17.860 --> 01:57:18.860]   That's fun.
[01:57:18.860 --> 01:57:21.940]   And then like three hours later, you've got like multiple tracks and two different trans
[01:57:21.940 --> 01:57:23.660]   positions and eight different melodies.
[01:57:23.660 --> 01:57:25.540]   And it's like just, just screwing around.
[01:57:25.540 --> 01:57:26.540]   I thought, oh, you know what?
[01:57:26.540 --> 01:57:27.540]   I love to hear.
[01:57:27.540 --> 01:57:38.540]   And it's like, Oh, look, I got it now.
[01:57:38.540 --> 01:57:41.860]   So it's like, you buy certain games because you like to fill in those four and a half minutes
[01:57:41.860 --> 01:57:43.540]   to 10 minutes of boredom.
[01:57:43.540 --> 01:57:46.940]   And then there's sometimes music apps you buy because it's like, Oh, I wonder if I could
[01:57:46.940 --> 01:57:51.100]   I have no melody in my head, but I bet just by drawing things on this little grid, I can
[01:57:51.100 --> 01:57:52.100]   make something interesting.
[01:57:52.100 --> 01:57:55.300]   Oh, look, 10 minutes later, I have something interesting.
[01:57:55.300 --> 01:57:57.300]   I'm 99.
[01:57:57.300 --> 01:57:58.300]   I'm 99.
[01:57:58.300 --> 01:58:03.820]   Pixie PIXI tracker for iPhone or iPad, either one.
[01:58:03.820 --> 01:58:06.940]   You laughed at my plank.
[01:58:06.940 --> 01:58:07.940]   We scoffed.
[01:58:07.940 --> 01:58:08.940]   You scoffed.
[01:58:08.940 --> 01:58:09.940]   So I installed it.
[01:58:09.940 --> 01:58:11.380]   Look, it works.
[01:58:11.380 --> 01:58:16.940]   I can I can add my keys from a magnet.
[01:58:16.940 --> 01:58:20.340]   And I have a little platform for my phone.
[01:58:20.340 --> 01:58:26.100]   But now I replaced, I've not replaced, but I submit for your approval from ilovehandles.com.
[01:58:26.100 --> 01:58:28.260]   The next cool thing.
[01:58:28.260 --> 01:58:30.460]   This is the Gumby trunk.
[01:58:30.460 --> 01:58:31.460]   It's called the trunk.
[01:58:31.460 --> 01:58:34.620]   It is a iPhone charger.
[01:58:34.620 --> 01:58:40.900]   It's a lightning, lightning port from ilove handles, but USB on this side.
[01:58:40.900 --> 01:58:42.460]   Can I borrow your iPhone?
[01:58:42.460 --> 01:58:44.020]   Yeah, because watch.
[01:58:44.020 --> 01:58:45.020]   Yeah.
[01:58:45.020 --> 01:58:46.020]   So watch.
[01:58:46.020 --> 01:58:47.940]   So I'm bending it, plugging into the USB.
[01:58:47.940 --> 01:58:55.780]   Now I'm going to mount your iPhone on it and look, it just floats straight in the air.
[01:58:55.780 --> 01:58:56.780]   Like that.
[01:58:56.780 --> 01:58:58.140]   Sand straight up.
[01:58:58.140 --> 01:58:59.540]   How about that?
[01:58:59.540 --> 01:59:03.420]   I'm sure that's a level of stress on the USB port that Apple completely intended that
[01:59:03.420 --> 01:59:04.820]   for this support.
[01:59:04.820 --> 01:59:10.180]   Carefully, carefully engineered with the ilove handles, folks, do say do not attempt to
[01:59:10.180 --> 01:59:17.460]   bend it from the phone or the USB thing, remove it, and then re-bend as needed.
[01:59:17.460 --> 01:59:18.460]   There.
[01:59:18.460 --> 01:59:21.580]   Now I get a nice twist on it.
[01:59:21.580 --> 01:59:23.060]   How about that?
[01:59:23.060 --> 01:59:24.060]   Now.
[01:59:24.060 --> 01:59:25.740]   Now how much would you pay?
[01:59:25.740 --> 01:59:28.140]   Eddie Murphy was doing the voice.
[01:59:28.140 --> 01:59:29.940]   It'd be priceless.
[01:59:29.940 --> 01:59:31.580]   I love handles.com.
[01:59:31.580 --> 01:59:33.740]   Okay, you mocked my plank.
[01:59:33.740 --> 01:59:36.300]   But what about that?
[01:59:36.300 --> 01:59:37.300]   It's called wheels.
[01:59:37.300 --> 01:59:45.140]   It doesn't help, but when he keeps saying mocking my plank, I keep imagining a BBC sitcom
[01:59:45.140 --> 01:59:49.180]   in which the vicar is knocking on the door, but he hears, "Now don't bend it that way.
[01:59:49.180 --> 01:59:51.180]   I don't want something to break."
[01:59:51.180 --> 01:59:53.340]   It's amazing how it keeps me.
[01:59:53.340 --> 01:59:54.340]   You won't walk.
[01:59:54.340 --> 01:59:55.340]   You want flying.
[01:59:55.340 --> 01:59:56.340]   Oh, all right.
[01:59:56.340 --> 01:59:57.940]   Keeping up with appearances.
[01:59:57.940 --> 02:00:01.740]   I guess I probably shouldn't order the pinhead then, which is a pair of them.
[02:00:01.740 --> 02:00:03.300]   Are you being served 2013?
[02:00:03.300 --> 02:00:08.300]   If I ordered the pinhead you would mock my pinhead, wouldn't you?
[02:00:08.300 --> 02:00:11.060]   I'd be sure to unmount it before you change the position.
[02:00:11.060 --> 02:00:12.460]   Well, you must unmount it.
[02:00:12.460 --> 02:00:15.820]   Now this is a dock with feet.
[02:00:15.820 --> 02:00:16.820]   How about that?
[02:00:16.820 --> 02:00:17.820]   Now how much would you pay?
[02:00:17.820 --> 02:00:18.820]   All right.
[02:00:18.820 --> 02:00:20.340]   But wait, there's more.
[02:00:20.340 --> 02:00:23.060]   All right, I love handles.com.
[02:00:23.060 --> 02:00:25.980]   These guys, I think they're very innovative.
[02:00:25.980 --> 02:00:28.340]   You guys think they're not.
[02:00:28.340 --> 02:00:29.340]   But I'm just saying.
[02:00:29.340 --> 02:00:30.340]   I didn't say they weren't innovative.
[02:00:30.340 --> 02:00:32.020]   I'm just not sure what to do with it.
[02:00:32.020 --> 02:00:35.020]   It made for some amazingly entertaining shows, Leo.
[02:00:35.020 --> 02:00:37.420]   The trunk, I think the plank is a good idea.
[02:00:37.420 --> 02:00:38.820]   It's only $20.
[02:00:38.820 --> 02:00:41.420]   And it comes in black or white.
[02:00:41.420 --> 02:00:42.420]   There you go.
[02:00:42.420 --> 02:00:43.500]   And now how about that?
[02:00:43.500 --> 02:00:44.500]   What about that?
[02:00:44.500 --> 02:00:45.500]   What about you plug it into your charger?
[02:00:45.500 --> 02:00:46.940]   The black goes to my iPhone there.
[02:00:46.940 --> 02:00:47.940]   You like that, right?
[02:00:47.940 --> 02:00:49.260]   Yeah, that's much nicer.
[02:00:49.260 --> 02:00:51.460]   Okay, so you can do that too.
[02:00:51.460 --> 02:00:52.900]   You plug your charger into the wall.
[02:00:52.900 --> 02:00:54.980]   You plug the trunk into your charger.
[02:00:54.980 --> 02:00:57.380]   And then your iPhone floats above the plug.
[02:00:57.380 --> 02:01:00.220]   When next time I go to a hotel, I'm ready.
[02:01:00.220 --> 02:01:01.220]   You're right.
[02:01:01.220 --> 02:01:02.220]   I'm going to have a lot of stress on that.
[02:01:02.220 --> 02:01:04.660]   I don't think I do that.
[02:01:04.660 --> 02:01:05.660]   Thank you.
[02:01:05.660 --> 02:01:08.140]   Thank you for letting me borrow your phone.
[02:01:08.140 --> 02:01:09.140]   I hope I haven't ruined it.
[02:01:09.140 --> 02:01:10.140]   The phone's fine.
[02:01:10.140 --> 02:01:16.020]   Do I make a charging cord for the MacBook Air so you can do the same thing to sort of
[02:01:16.020 --> 02:01:18.220]   bend it and upright position next to the outlet?
[02:01:18.220 --> 02:01:20.820]   Just have it floating in the air.
[02:01:20.820 --> 02:01:25.620]   Hey, it works.
[02:01:25.620 --> 02:01:26.820]   That's it for this show.
[02:01:26.820 --> 02:01:27.820]   There it is.
[02:01:27.820 --> 02:01:31.700]   I think that's a good way to use it with the plugged into the wall.
[02:01:31.700 --> 02:01:35.900]   Also, it looks like a really cool, useful, compact thing to having a laptop bag.
[02:01:35.900 --> 02:01:36.900]   Yeah.
[02:01:36.900 --> 02:01:42.540]   It's a rare way to make sure that you have a lightning to USB connector that you don't
[02:01:42.540 --> 02:01:45.340]   ever steal out of there and leave at your desk when you travel.
[02:01:45.340 --> 02:01:46.340]   Not much chance of that.
[02:01:46.340 --> 02:01:47.340]   It's not a tangle.
[02:01:47.340 --> 02:01:48.340]   It's right.
[02:01:48.340 --> 02:01:49.340]   No tangles.
[02:01:49.340 --> 02:01:52.380]   Yeah, that's a selling point in of itself.
[02:01:52.380 --> 02:01:53.380]   And if you have a seizure.
[02:01:53.380 --> 02:02:00.180]   Keeps you from biting your tongue.
[02:02:00.180 --> 02:02:01.180]   Oh, yes.
[02:02:01.180 --> 02:02:02.180]   You can put it on your mofy.
[02:02:02.180 --> 02:02:03.180]   Stick it in your mofy.
[02:02:03.180 --> 02:02:04.180]   It takes me a little while.
[02:02:04.180 --> 02:02:05.180]   I'm not very smart.
[02:02:05.180 --> 02:02:06.180]   Stick your trunk in your mofy.
[02:02:06.180 --> 02:02:08.060]   Stick your trunk in your mofy.
[02:02:08.060 --> 02:02:10.380]   And now, now how much would you pay?
[02:02:10.380 --> 02:02:11.380]   Look at that.
[02:02:11.380 --> 02:02:12.380]   That's pretty good.
[02:02:12.380 --> 02:02:13.380]   Yeah.
[02:02:13.380 --> 02:02:14.380]   Oh, Jesus.
[02:02:14.380 --> 02:02:15.380]   I heard a crack.
[02:02:15.380 --> 02:02:16.380]   Not this nice thing.
[02:02:16.380 --> 02:02:21.620]   I think, again, I would say do not use the USB port.
[02:02:21.620 --> 02:02:22.620]   I broke your trunk.
[02:02:22.620 --> 02:02:25.020]   Sorry, if you broke the trunk, I don't care about that.
[02:02:25.020 --> 02:02:28.740]   But it said don't bend it in the you don't use the USB port for leverage.
[02:02:28.740 --> 02:02:29.740]   But see, then it works.
[02:02:29.740 --> 02:02:30.740]   It's not true.
[02:02:30.740 --> 02:02:31.740]   It is bigger.
[02:02:31.740 --> 02:02:32.740]   Okay.
[02:02:32.740 --> 02:02:34.740]   It's quite a nice trunk.
[02:02:34.740 --> 02:02:37.980]   I guess I didn't follow the directions very well.
[02:02:37.980 --> 02:02:38.980]   Did it break?
[02:02:38.980 --> 02:02:39.980]   Oh, it's just.
[02:02:39.980 --> 02:02:40.980]   I miss this look.
[02:02:40.980 --> 02:02:41.980]   You didn't break.
[02:02:41.980 --> 02:02:42.980]   It's a little loose.
[02:02:42.980 --> 02:02:43.980]   I did a little bit.
[02:02:43.980 --> 02:02:44.980]   Sorry.
[02:02:44.980 --> 02:02:45.980]   I don't want it anyway.
[02:02:45.980 --> 02:02:46.980]   All right.
[02:02:46.980 --> 02:02:47.980]   That's it for this show.
[02:02:47.980 --> 02:02:48.980]   Thank you so much.
[02:02:48.980 --> 02:02:49.980]   Dan, I hope you'll come back.
[02:02:49.980 --> 02:02:52.100]   I hope this we didn't scare you off.
[02:02:52.100 --> 02:02:53.100]   I was delighted.
[02:02:53.100 --> 02:02:54.100]   Thank you for having me on.
[02:02:54.100 --> 02:02:56.980]   Dan Morin is senior editor at Macworld.com.
[02:02:56.980 --> 02:02:58.700]   What are you working on right now, Dan?
[02:02:58.700 --> 02:03:02.340]   Well, I usually do new stuff, but it's a little bit slow as we've noticed.
[02:03:02.340 --> 02:03:03.340]   Yes.
[02:03:03.340 --> 02:03:09.100]   We managed to fill two hours with wonderful verbiage speculation.
[02:03:09.100 --> 02:03:10.100]   I didn't even have to make it.
[02:03:10.100 --> 02:03:11.620]   You guys to make up a story.
[02:03:11.620 --> 02:03:12.620]   We did.
[02:03:12.620 --> 02:03:14.700]   I had some great stories too.
[02:03:14.700 --> 02:03:16.260]   Let's do that next week.
[02:03:16.260 --> 02:03:17.260]   Next week.
[02:03:17.260 --> 02:03:19.460]   Here's what we're going to do next week because it's going to be slow through August.
[02:03:19.460 --> 02:03:20.460]   Yes.
[02:03:20.460 --> 02:03:21.860]   Until the next announcements.
[02:03:21.860 --> 02:03:23.340]   So here's what we're going to do next week.
[02:03:23.340 --> 02:03:25.820]   I want each of you to make up a story.
[02:03:25.820 --> 02:03:26.820]   Don't tell me it's made up.
[02:03:26.820 --> 02:03:30.140]   You can even add it to the rundown.
[02:03:30.140 --> 02:03:36.480]   And then we'll ask, we'll say, on this show, there were, I guess, one wrong story, one
[02:03:36.480 --> 02:03:38.020]   made up story for each of us.
[02:03:38.020 --> 02:03:39.020]   Right.
[02:03:39.020 --> 02:03:40.020]   And we'll ask the audience at home, dude.
[02:03:40.020 --> 02:03:41.020]   I'm going to find the wrong story.
[02:03:41.020 --> 02:03:44.180]   And before the show's over, we'll tell you.
[02:03:44.180 --> 02:03:49.340]   Well, what we should do, we should all put like 20 bucks in a pot.
[02:03:49.340 --> 02:03:55.260]   And viewers have to guess which one was wrong or which one's valid.
[02:03:55.260 --> 02:03:59.860]   And the most, whoever makes up the story that has most people believing in it and causes
[02:03:59.860 --> 02:04:03.700]   Apple to actually not even allow us to even buy Apple products in the future.
[02:04:03.700 --> 02:04:06.700]   So that was a bad idea.
[02:04:06.700 --> 02:04:07.700]   Let's not do that.
[02:04:07.700 --> 02:04:10.500]   That's from the NPR show.
[02:04:10.500 --> 02:04:12.500]   Wait, wait, don't tell me.
[02:04:12.500 --> 02:04:13.740]   Wait, wait, don't tell me.
[02:04:13.740 --> 02:04:14.740]   We'll do that.
[02:04:14.740 --> 02:04:15.740]   We'll have four stories.
[02:04:15.740 --> 02:04:16.980]   One of them will be true.
[02:04:16.980 --> 02:04:19.940]   And they will ask the chatroom to vote.
[02:04:19.940 --> 02:04:20.940]   We'll do a straw poll.
[02:04:20.940 --> 02:04:22.780]   We'll ask the chatroom to whoever fools.
[02:04:22.780 --> 02:04:26.380]   So we got to think of the most outrageous stories to actually true next week.
[02:04:26.380 --> 02:04:27.380]   Oh, yeah.
[02:04:27.380 --> 02:04:28.380]   And then we can--
[02:04:28.380 --> 02:04:29.380]   That's easy.
[02:04:29.380 --> 02:04:30.380]   So we'll go around and each person will give their story.
[02:04:30.380 --> 02:04:32.380]   That'll be one section in the show.
[02:04:32.380 --> 02:04:33.380]   Yeah.
[02:04:33.380 --> 02:04:34.380]   And that would be good to use for every show.
[02:04:34.380 --> 02:04:35.380]   That'd be fun.
[02:04:35.380 --> 02:04:36.380]   It's a new segment.
[02:04:36.380 --> 02:04:37.380]   I'll be in Scotland.
[02:04:37.380 --> 02:04:39.220]   Do that with your permission to knowledge this time.
[02:04:39.220 --> 02:04:40.220]   What?
[02:04:40.220 --> 02:04:43.700]   It'd be nice to do that with your permission to knowledge this time.
[02:04:43.700 --> 02:04:48.940]   The Chicago-- Chicago, sometimes where I assure you never makes up stories.
[02:04:48.940 --> 02:04:52.340]   He is the journalist, the quintessential journalist.
[02:04:52.340 --> 02:04:53.340]   Oh, go.
[02:04:53.340 --> 02:04:55.860]   Thank you for being here with your flattened squirrel.
[02:04:55.860 --> 02:05:00.060]   I'm sure-- we just had a big thunderstorm in the middle of the show.
[02:05:00.060 --> 02:05:02.700]   I'm sure that squirrel is being a little bit more peppery now.
[02:05:02.700 --> 02:05:03.700]   He's peppery, yes.
[02:05:03.700 --> 02:05:04.700]   He's woken up.
[02:05:04.700 --> 02:05:05.700]   Thank you, Alex Lindsey.
[02:05:05.700 --> 02:05:07.180]   Where are you traveling to next?
[02:05:07.180 --> 02:05:08.180]   Scotland.
[02:05:08.180 --> 02:05:09.180]   Next week.
[02:05:09.180 --> 02:05:10.180]   Oh, so I should be able to--
[02:05:10.180 --> 02:05:11.180]   Land of my people.
[02:05:11.180 --> 02:05:12.460]   Yeah, and my people too.
[02:05:12.460 --> 02:05:13.460]   Yeah.
[02:05:13.460 --> 02:05:14.460]   They kicked us out.
[02:05:14.460 --> 02:05:15.460]   So I'm going to be like, I'm going to get there.
[02:05:15.460 --> 02:05:16.980]   I'm going to be like, what are you doing here?
[02:05:16.980 --> 02:05:17.980]   I thought we told you not to be there.
[02:05:17.980 --> 02:05:18.980]   The lenses.
[02:05:18.980 --> 02:05:21.420]   What county-- what area in Edinburgh?
[02:05:21.420 --> 02:05:22.420]   How fun.
[02:05:22.420 --> 02:05:23.420]   I used to live there or just outside.
[02:05:23.420 --> 02:05:24.420]   Really?
[02:05:24.420 --> 02:05:25.420]   I used to outside.
[02:05:25.420 --> 02:05:26.420]   I was school there for a while.
[02:05:26.420 --> 02:05:27.420]   So--
[02:05:27.420 --> 02:05:28.420]   Where'd you go?
[02:05:28.420 --> 02:05:29.420]   --at Edinburgh?
[02:05:29.420 --> 02:05:30.420]   University of Edinburgh?
[02:05:30.420 --> 02:05:31.420]   Yeah.
[02:05:31.420 --> 02:05:32.420]   I studied there for some college.
[02:05:32.420 --> 02:05:34.420]   I think I'm going to be a little outside of Edinburgh.
[02:05:34.420 --> 02:05:36.220]   There's evidently a big golf tournament going on.
[02:05:36.220 --> 02:05:37.220]   Are you going to play golf?
[02:05:37.220 --> 02:05:38.220]   There's probably no golf in a play.
[02:05:38.220 --> 02:05:39.220]   Not at that tournament.
[02:05:39.220 --> 02:05:40.220]   They're not going to be in there.
[02:05:40.220 --> 02:05:41.220]   Nice walk ruined.
[02:05:41.220 --> 02:05:42.220]   It's a good--
[02:05:42.220 --> 02:05:43.220]   --the links course.
[02:05:43.220 --> 02:05:44.220]   Yes.
[02:05:44.220 --> 02:05:45.220]   Yes.
[02:05:45.220 --> 02:05:46.220]   So I'll be in some tent.
[02:05:46.220 --> 02:05:49.860]   So if you do live in Scotland and you do see Alex just walk up without any introduction
[02:05:49.860 --> 02:05:54.820]   to say, you got a lot of damn nerve showing your face here again against what your ancestors
[02:05:54.820 --> 02:05:55.820]   did to my ancestors.
[02:05:55.820 --> 02:05:56.820]   After that.
[02:05:56.820 --> 02:05:57.820]   You've got all of them.
[02:05:57.820 --> 02:05:58.820]   I'm all of them.
[02:05:58.820 --> 02:05:59.820]   No.
[02:05:59.820 --> 02:06:00.820]   Lindsay.
[02:06:00.820 --> 02:06:06.100]   And then let them just show a birthmark that's saying, I am your doom.
[02:06:06.100 --> 02:06:07.340]   Claymore is that done?
[02:06:07.340 --> 02:06:08.340]   Yes, exactly.
[02:06:08.340 --> 02:06:11.220]   My name is Macfarro then Macfash.
[02:06:11.220 --> 02:06:14.460]   And you killed my father.
[02:06:14.460 --> 02:06:15.460]   Prepare to die.
[02:06:15.460 --> 02:06:16.460]   Prepare to die.
[02:06:16.460 --> 02:06:19.420]   It'll be a beautiful day.
[02:06:19.420 --> 02:06:22.620]   We also thank Mr. Renee Ritchie of iMore.com.
[02:06:22.620 --> 02:06:24.260]   How's it going with your talk thing?
[02:06:24.260 --> 02:06:25.900]   Is that so on?
[02:06:25.900 --> 02:06:26.900]   Talkmobile2013.com?
[02:06:26.900 --> 02:06:28.060]   Absolutely.
[02:06:28.060 --> 02:06:32.580]   We did social last week and Leo told us that he did not recommend normal people joining
[02:06:32.580 --> 02:06:33.580]   Twitter.
[02:06:33.580 --> 02:06:35.380]   So you can go there and listen to that video.
[02:06:35.380 --> 02:06:37.660]   We have the big ones coming up next week.
[02:06:37.660 --> 02:06:40.540]   That's the platform, the cross platform, all the different strengths and weaknesses
[02:06:40.540 --> 02:06:42.820]   of hardware and software.
[02:06:42.820 --> 02:06:44.300]   And we have Leo on record for that one too.
[02:06:44.300 --> 02:06:46.700]   So it'll be fun to launch.
[02:06:46.700 --> 02:06:49.940]   Fun, fun, fun, talkmobile2013.com.
[02:06:49.940 --> 02:06:55.060]   I will point out for the coincidental record that Ritchie, my sept comes from Edinburgh
[02:06:55.060 --> 02:06:56.060]   too.
[02:06:56.060 --> 02:06:57.060]   It's a part of the Macintosh clan.
[02:06:57.060 --> 02:07:00.100]   So Alex can go and insult my ancestors as well.
[02:07:00.100 --> 02:07:03.100]   My grandfather was Gordon Dunlap.
[02:07:03.100 --> 02:07:07.740]   And he came from the edge of the river Dunlap.
[02:07:07.740 --> 02:07:09.620]   Right outside of St. Andrews.
[02:07:09.620 --> 02:07:14.220]   I was where St. Andrews was invented, I might add.
[02:07:14.220 --> 02:07:15.220]   Yes.
[02:07:15.220 --> 02:07:16.580]   Mine was Alexander Delinze.
[02:07:16.580 --> 02:07:18.460]   Who was William Wallace in the background?
[02:07:18.460 --> 02:07:19.460]   Wow.
[02:07:19.460 --> 02:07:20.460]   That's how we--
