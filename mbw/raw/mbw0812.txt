[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.840]   We'll talk about it, what Apple might announce.
[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.080]   And there is a very special exclusive in-person portion.
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.560]   Will Renee get an invitation?
[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.520]   He's celebrating two years as a YouTube star.
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.360]   A great video for Renee all about that.

[00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.020]   and we find out why some people get iPhone updates
[00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:30.900]   before others.
[00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.380]   It's all coming up next on Mac Break Weekly.

[00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.180]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly,
[00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.860]   the show we cover the latest news from Apple.
[00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.620]   And there is actually news this week.
[00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.780]   Alex Lindsay is here from officehours.global
[00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.420]   at 090.media. Hello, Alex.
[00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.260]   Hi, how's it going?
[00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:03.900]   Going well.
[00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.420]   Going well.
[00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.340]   This is bringing us here in Northern California.
[00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.700]   It's now it's getting kind of warm.
[00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:10.540]   Yeah.
[00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:11.380]   Yeah.
[00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:12.220]   Yeah.
[00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.860]   So it's all the way up to the,
[00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.580]   yeah, it's all the way up in the mid 70s at times.
[00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:16.940]   I think it's going to be one reason that.
[00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.300]   I think we're going to 90s at some point this week.
[00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.140]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.340]   Every time it rains here, I'm always like,
[00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.180]   wow, it's here.
[00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.500]   I wish it was actually still rains here.
[00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.940]   No, but when it rains, I realized that we were so used
[00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.420]   to drought now that when it rains,
[00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.860]   you're just like, what is this stuff coming out of the air?
[00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.660]   (laughing)
[00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:32.540]   It's true.
[00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.980]   We're heading into a massive drought, unfortunately.
[00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.540]   It's gotten the point now where people
[00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.380]   are painting on their sides of their buildings.
[00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.820]   This might sound strange, but I wish it would rain.
[00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.420]   Right on the side of a building downtown.
[00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:50.300]   Please.
[00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.620]   Please.
[00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.140]   Bagging, I don't think the rain gods
[00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.780]   paying attention to painting.
[00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.220]   Well, the problem is you have the murals.
[00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.060]   Both ends of it.
[00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.060]   You know, like if--
[00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.100]   Yeah, if it rains too much, then we hate it.
[00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.540]   Well, no, but it's a drought,
[00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.940]   but there's a chance that the water,
[00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.380]   that the ocean might go up three feet,
[00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.060]   which means that at about nine feet,
[00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.020]   my house is now in an island.
[00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.620]   It goes no longer, no longer, but at three feet,
[00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:14.860]   it just gets, there's a lot of water.
[00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.220]   I haven't checked the studio.
[00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.060]   The water.
[00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.700]   Our house is high enough that we'd have to have
[00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.580]   a 60 foot sea level rise, which seems unlikely.
[00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.140]   If both ends, if all the ice melted,
[00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.700]   my house would be beachfront property.
[00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.940]   It sits, I checked it, and it just comes
[00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:30.940]   right up to the lower yard.
[00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:31.780]   Yikes.
[00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.500]   If both ends know.
[00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:34.780]   Yeah, I don't think that'll happen.
[00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.100]   I think we're seeing so far.
[00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.900]   In our lifetime, your kids, I'm sorry.
[00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:39.740]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:40.580]   No bets are off.
[00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.580]   Andy and I, co Chicago, sometimes no.
[00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:44.660]   Not for a long time.
[00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.780]   Where does that come from?
[00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.980]   Just, you know, as a force of habit, WGBH.
[00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.140]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.300]   And then-- Rules off the tongue.
[00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.140]   In beautiful New England.
[00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.500]   Hello.
[00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:54.500]   Feel through England.
[00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.220]   Finally, after the 20 degree late March,
[00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.060]   such a beautiful day today, this is the first day that I
[00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.020]   spent an hour doing the springtime stuff to the house,
[00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:09.380]   where if I open the right series of doors and windows,
[00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.940]   I will get cross ventilation from one side of the building
[00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:12.860]   to the other.
[00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.140]   So I will have this window open until shooting
[00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.900]   and ambulances, and then, of course, I'll shut it.
[00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.100]   For the sake of audio.
[00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.780]   But oh my god, I'm enjoying the spring.
[00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.420]   Also, I don't know if it's spring yet in Montreal,
[00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.820]   but Renee Ritchie is here celebrating his second anniversary
[00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.300]   as a fully independent YouTuber.
[00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.140]   Welcome Renee.
[00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:36.540]   As my own nation state.
[00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.220]   Yeah, it's a bomb you 11 degrees.
[00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:39.380]   I'm running naked through the ice.
[00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:40.060]   It's amazing.
[00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.180]   11, I hope-- I'm hoping that's--
[00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.660]   Celsius.
[00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:43.380]   Celsius, yeah.
[00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:44.740]   OK.
[00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.300]   27-- Sorry for people in America and Zanzibar
[00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.220]   or whatever the other country is that doesn't use Celsius.
[00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.540]   It's like, I don't know, 70-something.
[00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.380]   So this was on the second anniversary,
[00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:53.900]   and we were talking about before the show began,
[00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.700]   but I have to show a little bit of it.
[00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:58.940]   You created a video.
[00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.300]   On the two years.
[00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.980]   All right, Renee, you already know what I'm going to ask.
[00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:02.540]   Congratulations.
[00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:03.660]   You're the biggest fan here.
[00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.540]   And it's 27 YouTubers.
[00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:08.140]   Grill me about Apple.
[00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:09.220]   You know everybody.
[00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:09.900]   I'm impressed.
[00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.940]   It's Canadian thing, Leo.
[00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.020]   You just-- you got to be nice to people
[00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.300]   because you never know where you're going to take
[00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.740]   a shelter from the snow.
[00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.860]   Really great, and congratulations.
[00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:21.380]   Thank you.
[00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:24.060]   On the significant milestone.
[00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:24.860]   Two years in.
[00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:25.300]   Thank you.
[00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.460]   That's nice.
[00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:32.540]   We have some news this morning.
[00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.500]   WWDC was announced.
[00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:40.180]   But in an interesting turnabout, Apple has an--
[00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.780]   On Quest?
[00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:46.060]   It will be online, except there might be a little tiny day
[00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:46.780]   where you could go--
[00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.020]   Online asterisk.
[00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:49.020]   Yeah, asterisk.
[00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.580]   And see it.
[00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:54.780]   Apple will host a special day for developers and students
[00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:58.340]   at Apple Park on June 6th to watch the keynote
[00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.580]   and state of the union videos together along with the audience.
[00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.180]   It's the viewing party, Leo.
[00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:04.980]   Yeah, I think they want an audience, right?
[00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:06.860]   So that sounds like there'll be live--
[00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.220]   there'll be live keynotes with an audience.
[00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:10.300]   Or maybe they'll just--
[00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:11.380]   We're watching a movie together.
[00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:12.380]   For your movies.
[00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:14.460]   They might do that too, I guess.
[00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:15.260]   You think that's the good--
[00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.180]   That's the word of paper of the house.
[00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:18.420]   Alex Lindsay needs the popcorn.
[00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:20.740]   He's to provide the popcorn, or I'm not going to go.
[00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:21.740]   Exactly.
[00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:27.020]   No, no, this is a pretty interesting turn of the process,
[00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.620]   because I still think that watch parties make more sense
[00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:33.380]   to Apple than doing an actual live stage event again.
[00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:37.180]   You can produce so much denser content with it
[00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:39.740]   and make it more viewable for the millions of people
[00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:40.860]   that watch it otherwise.
[00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:43.700]   And so it's an interesting place to experiment
[00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:45.740]   with the idea of we're going to have a viewing event.
[00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.900]   We're going to let you come and watch it.
[00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:49.940]   And then you can go out and play with the new hardware,
[00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:51.580]   which will be out in the main foyer,
[00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:54.540]   the downstairs foyer, under the downstairs or whatever.
[00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:57.540]   And if it's successful, if they like it,
[00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:58.820]   I bet you will see a lot more of it.
[00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:02.180]   James Thompson had an interesting theory on Twitter.
[00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:06.260]   He says, my bet is so the people who are there
[00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:11.500]   can try out a headset in person.
[00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:12.540]   If it's ready--
[00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:15.220]   I mean, like, GDC was a test balloon, I think.
[00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:16.900]   And a lot of people got sick.
[00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:18.260]   And there were people who went with--
[00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:19.180]   and there was a whole--
[00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:20.500]   just this morning, it was a huge controversy
[00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:22.220]   because people went knowing they had COVID
[00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:24.500]   and didn't care, apparently, and got people sick.
[00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:28.260]   So I think Apple is also just being an abundance of caution
[00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:32.580]   because it's hard to tell where BA.2 will be by June as well.
[00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:33.740]   So this is just safe.
[00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:38.420]   Also, Apple is not the company that simply says, hey,
[00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:41.220]   random people, and audience, come on in and try out
[00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:43.380]   this thing that we've never introduced before.
[00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.260]   And we've never trained you personally on.
[00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.620]   So you can tell everybody what you thought about this first
[00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:48.380]   look at experience.
[00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:51.500]   Microsoft did it with HoloLens and got a lot of positive presses
[00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:52.300]   or results.
[00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:53.300]   But that's Microsoft.
[00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:54.380]   That's not Apple.
[00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:58.300]   I mean, this is also the 10th anniversary
[00:07:58.300 --> 00:07:59.980]   of the introduction of the iPad.
[00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:02.460]   And oh, my God, the rules that they--
[00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:03.660]   I got a pre-release one.
[00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:08.980]   And oh, my God, the number of rules that they had,
[00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:13.260]   they didn't even want me to let David Letterman have
[00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.940]   put on the show unless I was the one operating
[00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:19.180]   at all times who had two weeks with it and stuff like that.
[00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:21.780]   I absolutely do not believe that they would--
[00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:26.140]   unless they handpick a couple of really chosen people
[00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:30.300]   and they give them an embargo that says that after a week
[00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:32.780]   of using this, you get to say something about it
[00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:34.380]   under a flood of strict controls.
[00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:38.340]   I really don't see them showing them off to random strangers.
[00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:40.580]   And I think that the other problem is even if they did
[00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:43.180]   do that, you're better off in a lot of ways
[00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:45.420]   doing it in a controlled environment with only up to 1,000
[00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:47.820]   people and not all of them would be the people
[00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:48.660]   that you're looking for.
[00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:50.180]   I mean, half of them are going to be engineers
[00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:52.380]   that are from Apple in that theater.
[00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:55.700]   So the thing is, is that you only have a handful of people
[00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:58.020]   there to put those on and you can manage that.
[00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:02.980]   If you have them in at WWDC with thousands of people
[00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:05.900]   that want to try them on, especially in the COVID environment,
[00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:06.820]   even before COVID--
[00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:07.300]   Exactly.
[00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:10.100]   --it was always weird at conferences with Oculus
[00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:13.420]   or with Google's-- anybody, whatever it was doing,
[00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:14.940]   putting something up that everyone else
[00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:16.500]   is putting up against your eyes.
[00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:18.980]   Even if they tried to clean it or did whatever,
[00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:21.500]   it was always like, I was always like, no, thank you.
[00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:24.420]   I don't need to put on a random headset.
[00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:27.140]   When I was wearing my Google Glass to Comic-Cons
[00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:30.420]   and stuff like that, I knew that people would want to try it on.
[00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:33.140]   And so I always had a spray bottle of alcohol with me.
[00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:36.580]   So I would take them off, spray it down, let them use it.
[00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:37.380]   They came back to me.
[00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:38.740]   I would spray it down again.
[00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:39.580]   So yeah, I don't--
[00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:42.380]   And years passed, I would have said, you guys are so paranoid.
[00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:43.460]   But now I'm kind of--
[00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:44.060]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:44.860]   --going with you.
[00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:48.860]   I'm looking at the COVID community level in Santa Clara
[00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:49.300]   County.
[00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:52.820]   And right now, it's pretty benign.
[00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:57.620]   Masks mandates are done here in Northern California.
[00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:02.300]   People are coming and going just as if it were the good old days.
[00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:03.860]   So I wonder if this is an indicator
[00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:08.180]   that Apple might want to keep doing this even without COVID.
[00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:10.980]   I think that there is some value to having--
[00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:16.540]   there is a value for Apple to have something that is truly
[00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:17.540]   in person.
[00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:20.700]   But I think that there are a little conference process
[00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:22.060]   in the fall.
[00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:23.220]   Well, Apple--
[00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:25.820]   WWC was actually pretty successful on its own last year
[00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:29.380]   with really well-made videos that covered the stuff, which
[00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:31.220]   was actually better than the content that we were doing before.
[00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:34.660]   And they did play a face-time sessions one-on-one to one
[00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:35.420]   of the developers.
[00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:36.860]   You could hear everybody, Leon.
[00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:38.660]   I like this format.
[00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:41.140]   And I think I'll have seen a lot of developers today on Twitter
[00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:43.260]   say this is great because I didn't want to spend thousands
[00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.700]   of dollars coming to one of the most expensive areas
[00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:46.460]   in the world.
[00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:46.980]   --to monetize it.
[00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:48.260]   Yeah.
[00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260]   So there are some--
[00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:51.340]   I think there are--
[00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:52.660]   --there are--
[00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:54.620]   I think that I could see--
[00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:56.860]   I'm not saying that it's never going to come back.
[00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:59.620]   I could see that the virtual part of this
[00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:02.620]   is going to be a bigger and bigger part of what WWC is.
[00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:06.140]   Because WWC should be 250,000 or 350,000 or 500,000 people
[00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:07.140]   online.
[00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:09.140]   And for the people who can make it in, it's there.
[00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:11.060]   But I think that we have to figure out how to keep on integrating
[00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:11.260]   them.
[00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:12.620]   And this is a great way for Apple to do it.
[00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:16.300]   I think it's totally prudent inside of not knowing with COVID.
[00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:21.660]   COVID has snuck up on us a couple times now.
[00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:25.140]   So building something in the middle of all of this
[00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:27.180]   is a little nutty.
[00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:28.700]   So I think that it makes--
[00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:30.340]   it's a prudent decision.
[00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:33.020]   I think it allows Apple to keep on experimenting.
[00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:35.820]   And what I hope they do is do what they did in the fall
[00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:36.460]   in the summer.
[00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:40.460]   So come right after WWDC and then immediately start doing--
[00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:42.220]   I thought there are sessions other than using WebEx,
[00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:44.700]   which was a disaster.
[00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:48.740]   Their sessions, I thought, were pretty well designed.
[00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:51.620]   There was no overlap, which is like, when conferences now
[00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:54.820]   do overlap, do multiple tracks, I'm like, why would you do that?
[00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:55.620]   You know what?
[00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:56.140]   You use Apple.
[00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:56.820]   You use Apple.
[00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:57.900]   It's a set of words.
[00:11:57.900 --> 00:11:59.020]   Zoom.
[00:11:59.020 --> 00:11:59.540]   Zoom.
[00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:02.540]   Zoom's way better than WebEx.
[00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:05.540]   I use all of them all the time because I get paid to use them
[00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:06.340]   all.
[00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:07.780]   And I get-- and I mean, meetings all the time.
[00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:09.060]   So I have a pretty clear idea.
[00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:13.780]   WebEx is a horrible, horrible platform.
[00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:17.580]   Microsoft Teams is actually considerably better.
[00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:19.180]   I think Zoom is at the top of Microsoft Teams.
[00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:21.020]   Can't see Apple using Microsoft Teams, that way.
[00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:21.860]   No, they couldn't.
[00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:22.500]   No, I'm saying.
[00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:25.060]   What I'm saying is that Zoom is the one that is not--
[00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:26.100]   Apple can't use Google.
[00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:26.620]   It's agnostic.
[00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:27.140]   Yeah.
[00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:28.300]   Well, if they made Facebook--
[00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:30.020]   Facebook's on key teams, they could use that.
[00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:30.940]   But they don't make it--
[00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:32.500]   I don't think that Apple knows how to make a--
[00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:34.940]   I don't think Apple knows how to make a FaceTime that
[00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:36.300]   would be worth using.
[00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:38.980]   I mean, I don't think they have that skill set at this point.
[00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:41.740]   I just switched to Zoom.
[00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:43.780]   We've been very, very happy.
[00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:44.980]   It's stable.
[00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:47.100]   It's got-- and the bottom line is
[00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:49.220]   is that the Zoom Bada Company called
[00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:52.060]   "Leminal," which I had recommended last year.
[00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:55.300]   And it changed-- it's a game changer.
[00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:57.060]   We like to say that everybody-- oh, you just
[00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:58.580]   get to hire more people to do something.
[00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:02.380]   But every once in a while, you hire a handful of people
[00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:03.980]   who-- and let them build a team.
[00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:08.380]   And right now, the best video conferencing team in the world
[00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:10.100]   is at Zoom.
[00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:11.660]   They just-- they hired the right talent.
[00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:12.940]   They have the right quarterback.
[00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:14.060]   They have the right running back.
[00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:15.060]   They have the right receivers.
[00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:17.220]   They have-- sorry for the sports references.
[00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:19.860]   But they have a Super Bowl team that's playing in there.
[00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:21.140]   And that makes a difference.
[00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:25.220]   And so Zoom right now is the--
[00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:27.820]   by far the best video conferencing platform.
[00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:28.980]   Yeah.
[00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:31.780]   Yeah, I think that's probably certainly been our case,
[00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:33.500]   our experience.
[00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:36.020]   So Renee, you think you'll get an invite?
[00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:38.980]   That's going to be a very hot ticket on--
[00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:40.140]   I'm getting interested.
[00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:41.780]   So I'm not going to get my hopes up.
[00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:44.700]   I don't have high confidence that we'll have a VR headset
[00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:45.500]   at WWDC.
[00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:48.740]   I think that's maybe a September thing, if not early 2022
[00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:48.980]   thing.
[00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:52.300]   I'd rather be surprised than disappointed.
[00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:53.700]   I'm sure they'll have some press there.
[00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:55.980]   I don't know if it'll be just US only press or it'll be--
[00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:57.500]   The press really says--
[00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:00.060]   specifically developers and students.
[00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:02.180]   They also say space will be limited in details
[00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:05.140]   about how to apply to attend will be provided on the site
[00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:06.860]   and app soon.
[00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:08.380]   They don't say anything about press.
[00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:10.220]   But I have to think if they're having people come in,
[00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:12.940]   they're going to have a hand full of press.
[00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:14.020]   It's a cool space.
[00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:16.340]   I don't know if I'd want to spend the whole day down there.
[00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:17.820]   Like, I don't know if I--
[00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:18.820]   There's a lot easier for us.
[00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:20.020]   I'm very happy watching the stream.
[00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:22.540]   Alex, it's a lot easier for us than it is for Renee
[00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:24.620]   coming all the way from the east coast.
[00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:26.860]   And the last-- everyone gets bigger for us.
[00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:29.780]   And the last Apple stream, there was 150 of us
[00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:31.420]   in after hours in part of the office hours.
[00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:32.500]   It's probably more fun.
[00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:33.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:33.500]   So much fun.
[00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:34.740]   We'll see if they're talking about it.
[00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:36.140]   Yeah, exactly, exactly.
[00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:38.220]   We're all talking about it during the thing.
[00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:39.740]   It's the geekiest way to watch it.
[00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:41.460]   And it was so much more fun than actually just
[00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:43.180]   sitting there watching it.
[00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:44.100]   Well, if this--
[00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:47.860]   And this hardware expectation is more like Mac Pro anyway.
[00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:50.940]   Because they showed off the 2013 Mac Pro at Dub Dub.
[00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:52.140]   And then you could go see it.
[00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:53.980]   They showed off the 2019 Mac Pro.
[00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:55.660]   And you could all go across the street and watch
[00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:58.260]   the workflows team demo it, which was amazing.
[00:14:58.260 --> 00:14:59.940]   So just seeing that kind of stuff as enough.
[00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:01.980]   I don't need to worry about headsets yet.
[00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:04.100]   But even that, controlling a hands-on room,
[00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:06.860]   we have a bunch of people putting hands on the same thing
[00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:09.180]   due to Alex's previous point or Andy's previous point.
[00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:11.420]   That's a lot of logistics.
[00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:13.460]   I think Apple's going to be a little challenged by a Mac
[00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:14.460]   Pro, to be honest with you.
[00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:15.180]   I'm very curious.
[00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:17.300]   We were talking about this on Sunday.
[00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:20.060]   Dan Warren was on Twitch.
[00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:25.260]   And I feel like just doubling the Ultra
[00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:30.580]   isn't going to be enough to make a compelling Pro,
[00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:33.220]   especially if they can't get this single-core--
[00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:34.540]   It's all about the PCIE slots.
[00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:36.020]   Yeah, so PCIE--
[00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:36.520]   What?
[00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:40.860]   Do they put PCIE slots in for AMD GPU?
[00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:41.660]   Can they even--
[00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:44.100]   No, no, you need controllers.
[00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:47.500]   And on all my AV in and out, so my Dante cards,
[00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:50.740]   my video cards, all the ways to get in and out
[00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:52.060]   is a real pain in the neck right now.
[00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:55.020]   It seems clear to me, Alex, and you correct me,
[00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:59.420]   because you're the Pro, that if you really want performance,
[00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:02.740]   you're going to buy a PC and run Linux on it.
[00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:03.820]   Or maybe Windows.
[00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:06.020]   But a Mac is not going to be what the--
[00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:07.340]   Behind--
[00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:10.900]   Slice, thin slice of high, high end pros are going to want.
[00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:13.540]   Well, I think that it depends on what they're doing.
[00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:16.620]   Like, so there are pros who definitely
[00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:18.900]   want to use a Mac.
[00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:22.340]   If you're using raw data, like really raw power,
[00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:25.140]   I'm going to put two or three, 30, 90s in my--
[00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:26.780]   you're not going to get that on a Mac.
[00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:27.500]   That's not--
[00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:29.020]   And we buy those kind of--
[00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:31.820]   So people living in the Mac ecosystem using logic
[00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:33.660]   or final cut, right?
[00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:34.820]   But I would say is, if you're going
[00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:37.380]   to go to buy a PC at Best Buy or something like that,
[00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:40.540]   then a Mac is probably going to outperform most of those things.
[00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:42.540]   But that's not what the Pro's doing.
[00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:44.180]   But I'm saying, if you're going to go to Puget Systems
[00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:46.260]   or build your own, well, a lot of Pro's do.
[00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:48.180]   I mean, you have to get that--
[00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:49.860]   there's not that many Pro's that need--
[00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:51.020]   I understand this small market.
[00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:55.700]   But if I'm a video Pro, the Macs are better than everything
[00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:58.700]   else right now because of the Apple Pro Res Accelerator.
[00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:02.020]   So just that one chip makes it the best place
[00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:03.780]   to do a lot of these things.
[00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:04.420]   Yeah.
[00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:05.980]   So it depends on what you're doing.
[00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:07.820]   Just aspirational hardware.
[00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:11.140]   I know, but pros are maybe less susceptible than the rest
[00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:13.180]   of us to this notion of I want to--
[00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:16.020]   You're a cool thing or the hot thing.
[00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:17.180]   But you said a YouTube is--
[00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:18.140]   You just bought a Mac Pro.
[00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:18.660]   I feel--
[00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:18.980]   I feel like--
[00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:19.340]   I feel like--
[00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:19.820]   --the L.S.
[00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:20.660]   Well, it's 600 gigabytes.
[00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:21.700]   I'm a little disappointed.
[00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:22.260]   I'll be honest with you.
[00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:25.060]   I'm a little disappointed with what Apple has done
[00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:28.620]   because without increasing the single core clock speed,
[00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:35.100]   and not having NVIDIA CUDA cores or some form of high end GPU,
[00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:36.740]   these are not--
[00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:37.540]   these are basically--
[00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:39.420]   It depends-- fancy iPhones.
[00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:42.500]   It depends on the kind of-- so it depends on the kind of 3D
[00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:43.060]   that you're doing.
[00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:46.100]   So you have to remember that for things that are high--
[00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:47.660]   because most of what we're testing right now
[00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:50.300]   is 3D that requires a lot of GPU processing,
[00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:52.420]   but not a lot of memory.
[00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:54.700]   And so the thing is, is that there are going to be things.
[00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:59.140]   So if I start throwing 300 million polygons with 8K
[00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:01.820]   textures into it, you may find that an M--
[00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:04.940]   the Ultra runs a whole lot better than a 3090,
[00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:07.100]   because the 3090 can't keep all the textures
[00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:08.300]   or the geometry in its memory.
[00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:09.980]   It's a unified memory.
[00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:12.020]   So the unified memory--
[00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:13.220]   so what we're seeing are tests that
[00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:16.620]   are optimized for graphics cards, not optimized for--
[00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:19.820]   I'm going to throw these massive pieces of geometry
[00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:21.780]   and texture maps into it.
[00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:23.700]   And so it may turn out that there are definitely things
[00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:25.500]   that you can do faster on your GPU,
[00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:28.620]   but that huge for doing film visual effects
[00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:31.220]   and for doing big 3D projects.
[00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:34.780]   I can see even stuff in BIM, which is normally a PC thing,
[00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:36.620]   that you could--
[00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:40.260]   you may find that if you're throwing huge textures--
[00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:41.700]   because one of the big things we have to do
[00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:43.940]   is we have to-- as soon as we build a model,
[00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:47.060]   I have to decimate or get rid of huge amounts of polygons
[00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:48.180]   or it won't run on the machine.
[00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:49.780]   I have to make the texture map smaller,
[00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:51.260]   because it won't run on the machine,
[00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:55.140]   because the GPU can't hold that data into the GPU
[00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:57.980]   or it has to swap, which makes it very inefficient.
[00:18:57.980 --> 00:18:59.260]   And so the thing is that--
[00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:00.900]   so I think that Apple--
[00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:02.020]   the jury's still out.
[00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:04.060]   It's a brand new technology.
[00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:08.180]   The GPUs are performing faster when you give them GPU tests,
[00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:09.940]   and the M1's not optimized for that.
[00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:12.540]   But the M1 may be optimized for something
[00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:14.940]   that in the future is going to be possibly more important
[00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:18.860]   when it comes to truly photoreal scenes, where you--
[00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:20.700]   I want to throw a billion polygons into something,
[00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:24.940]   and I wanted to have 200 gigs of texture maps.
[00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:26.260]   That's something that you--
[00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:27.900]   I don't think you throw at a GPU right now.
[00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:30.340]   You're using Unreal Engine.
[00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:32.460]   And Unreal Engine 5 came out today.
[00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:35.860]   And I suspect a lot of companies that
[00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:38.620]   are going to be doing this kind of stuff
[00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:40.980]   are going to want Unreal Engine.
[00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:44.340]   So Unreal Engine is really cool, and Nanite is the engine
[00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:47.740]   that's making that work is awesome.
[00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:50.100]   And Unreal Engine 5 is a ground--
[00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:51.340]   is a game changer.
[00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:52.140]   It absolutely is.
[00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:53.340]   But it's not photoreal.
[00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:54.620]   It's very close.
[00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:56.780]   But it's not a photoreal engine.
[00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:58.260]   Well, it's what you're saying, which
[00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:00.460]   is it really depends what you're doing.
[00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:05.420]   But I'm just starting to think that maybe hardcore professionals
[00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:11.060]   are not going to be as happy about the Mac Pro as they
[00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:12.380]   have been in the past, maybe.
[00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:14.300]   I think that it would still be-- it depends.
[00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:16.740]   I mean, the Mac Pro wasn't even that good at managing--
[00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:19.020]   I mean, the Mac Pro was no GPU.
[00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:19.460]   They bought it.
[00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:22.420]   They didn't buy it for the GPU, because the AMD stuff is not--
[00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:22.420]   Right.
[00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:23.380]   They wanted Nvidia.
[00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:23.900]   Yeah.
[00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:24.900]   Yeah.
[00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:25.900]   The problem is--
[00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:27.100]   And this is a big market for Apple.
[00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:29.580]   It's a tiny, tiny slice of the overall market.
[00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:30.980]   So they don't need to win at this,
[00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:32.580]   except that it's for perception.
[00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:34.180]   It's important.
[00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:38.140]   But I think that the issue is that, again, there
[00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:39.780]   are things that we want to do, for instance,
[00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:42.820]   in video rendering that requires huge--
[00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:44.660]   so if we want to put an 8K again-- when
[00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:47.340]   we talk about 8K, which high-end professionals--
[00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:48.540]   probably high-end professionals, people
[00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:49.940]   are thinking about that right now.
[00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:53.380]   I mean, I'm getting requests to consider 8K 120.
[00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:56.700]   So that's a lot of bandwidth and size,
[00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:59.180]   and it requires a lot of memory to do any kind of effects to it.
[00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:02.380]   And so the thing is that that's coming,
[00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:05.620]   and Apple is much more prepared for that than the PC market.
[00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:07.980]   And so there's definitely--
[00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:10.060]   I think that, again, it's a big heavy.
[00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:13.660]   It depends, as opposed to--
[00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:15.300]   it's a hardcore one way or the other.
[00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:16.620]   Yeah.
[00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:21.620]   Here's the Mandalorian, which uses Unreal Engine 5 for its max
[00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:22.980]   and spec drops.
[00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:24.740]   I don't think so.
[00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:26.140]   I don't think it uses--
[00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:27.700]   This is the Unreal--
[00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:29.420]   For maybe a 7-room 4.
[00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:31.380]   From season one of Mandalorian, you're right.
[00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:34.980]   But from season two, IOM built its own.
[00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:36.020]   Oh, interesting.
[00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:37.140]   Interesting.
[00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:38.420]   There's a lot of drama about that.
[00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:38.940]   Yeah.
[00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:40.060]   Oh, that's very interesting.
[00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:41.060]   Yeah.
[00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:43.220]   But yeah, but it's not--
[00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:44.700]   IOM has its own engine.
[00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:45.220]   Yeah.
[00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:46.100]   Well, that makes sense.
[00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:48.820]   IOM is known for developing tools.
[00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:51.460]   To Alex's point, I've tested the M1 Ultra
[00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:54.900]   against the NVIDIA 3090 card, and you can go toe-to-toe with it.
[00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:56.900]   It just depends on what you're doing,
[00:21:56.900 --> 00:22:00.500]   like with video-enhanced AI, which takes old video
[00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:01.620]   and makes it much better.
[00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:03.900]   I can beat it every single time with the same amount of frames,
[00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:04.860]   same amount of workload.
[00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:06.180]   I can beat the 3090.
[00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:08.620]   Some of the tests, like wildlife, it does slightly better
[00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:11.660]   and some of it, like GFX bench, it does slightly worse.
[00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:12.580]   Still neck and neck.
[00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:14.860]   It depends entirely on what task you're doing.
[00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:16.700]   And when you look at some of the demos,
[00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:18.420]   they have these--
[00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:19.660]   I'm forgetting the name of what it's called,
[00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:21.980]   but this giant spaceship demo that they put together
[00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:24.460]   with the Pro-Workflows team, they can do all those polygons
[00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:26.500]   Alex was talking about without the decimation,
[00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:27.780]   which doesn't matter to everybody,
[00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:29.340]   but matters to a lot of people.
[00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:32.420]   And I think the Mac Pro is really for those Apple--
[00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:34.420]   it's not for-- they're not competing with NVIDIA.
[00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:36.100]   If you want kudos cores, you want kudos cores.
[00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:38.820]   But there's a segment of Apple users
[00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:41.100]   who are holding on to Intel Mac Pros
[00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:43.780]   because they need more RAM, they need more of those resources,
[00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:45.900]   they need the ability to put those cards in
[00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:47.700]   because they work on these big network arrays.
[00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:50.460]   And also, these can't do with these--
[00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:52.940]   When Apple talks benchmarks and they put out graphs,
[00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:56.540]   it's always per power, per TPU.
[00:22:56.540 --> 00:22:57.860]   What they don't show is if, yeah,
[00:22:57.860 --> 00:23:00.660]   if you're willing to use 400 watts on your NVIDIA card,
[00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:01.500]   you can beat the--
[00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:02.740]   So that's not actually true.
[00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:03.620]   That's a misconception.
[00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:05.340]   And it's Apple's fault for not being clear,
[00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:07.540]   but that line doesn't continue.
[00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:09.500]   A lot of people assume it does because an NVIDIA card
[00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:12.180]   can suck in so much power, but that's power to system,
[00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:13.620]   not power in system.
[00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:15.380]   Apple doesn't have a big power to system.
[00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:17.180]   You don't have to put a bunch of stuff in,
[00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:19.900]   just to make the card light up before you do any processing.
[00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:22.460]   So that graph doesn't really extend very far.
[00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:24.180]   It's just once you're on the card,
[00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:27.420]   that's what you get from both systems.
[00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:29.820]   There's also an audience that we're overlooking here.
[00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:32.180]   There's one specific type of creator
[00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:34.580]   that has to have Macs and that's Mac developers.
[00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:36.460]   And a lot of them are really, really interested
[00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:39.900]   in compile time being shut down as slim as they can possibly
[00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:40.660]   get them.
[00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:44.140]   As far as the fast stick and rev, that's money in the bank.
[00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:46.660]   So that's one area in which I'm sure
[00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:48.060]   that we're going to see part of that.
[00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:50.260]   But I think overall, this really does--
[00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:51.940]   The conversation we're having right now
[00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:54.420]   really does point to how brilliant an idea,
[00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:58.020]   the idea of having a brand new nameplate for Mac
[00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:01.140]   called the Mac Studio, targeted at people,
[00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:05.300]   most of the people who would be sort of buying an entry level
[00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:08.900]   to maybe mid-level Mac Pro because they're convinced that--
[00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:10.140]   well, not that convinced them, but they
[00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:13.380]   know that they have to suck in 8K video, spit out 4K video
[00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:15.700]   with all kinds of effects and all kinds of composites.
[00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:19.820]   And this is to have a Mac that's designed and targeted
[00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:22.140]   specifically towards them solves a problem.
[00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:23.780]   They know that that's a bread and butter creator.
[00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:25.540]   That's a bread and butter sort of audience.
[00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:31.300]   But Lee, I think you're right that there's
[00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:34.020]   a wrong on the ladder above which anybody who's
[00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:37.020]   interested in that level of performance is stopping--
[00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:39.940]   is no longer thinking, why would I buy just simply--
[00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:43.940]   why would I just simply go to a website and order a pre-May,
[00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:47.260]   prefab, Mac, pre-May, prefab Windows machine
[00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:50.180]   when I can just basically assemble all the components
[00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:52.580]   I need as targeted specifically to what I
[00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:54.460]   need this amount of power to do.
[00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:57.980]   Sometimes it really is about having as much RAM as possible.
[00:24:57.980 --> 00:24:59.780]   When you're dealing with huge, huge data sets,
[00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:01.580]   you really just-- RAM is the king.
[00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:04.740]   Sometimes it really is a number of cores
[00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:07.100]   and how fast those cores can run.
[00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:12.420]   So I'm a little bit mystified as to how Apple attracts
[00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:14.620]   the people who need that level of performance.
[00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:17.820]   They're great up until this level, but up above them,
[00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:21.860]   they can't really design a Mac that's specifically
[00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:24.940]   for the needs of this one person who's willing to spend $12,000
[00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:25.740]   on a desktop.
[00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:28.940]   Well, I would also submit that the window is closing
[00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:32.460]   because GPU availability is coming back.
[00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:34.780]   Apple does not own unified memory.
[00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:37.420]   That's an old technology that anybody could adopt.
[00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:40.220]   Intel has already started using efficiency cores and performance
[00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:45.260]   cores to really improve the performance of its alder-like
[00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:46.580]   generation.
[00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:50.700]   I feel like Apple has shown the way, and they definitely led.
[00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:51.740]   But it's going to be--
[00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:54.940]   I'm not saying anything about anything below the Mac Pro.
[00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:56.540]   I'm saying Mac Pro is going to be a--
[00:25:56.540 --> 00:25:59.100]   maybe going to be a tougher sell.
[00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:00.260]   It's going to take a while.
[00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:01.580]   It's going to take a few generations.
[00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:02.500]   Yeah.
[00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:06.180]   And I think that, again, the market--
[00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:07.260]   I live in this market with--
[00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:07.620]   I know.
[00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:08.500]   That's why I ask you.
[00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:09.500]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:12.900]   But the market that is I need all of that power
[00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:14.380]   is super small.
[00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:17.020]   Like, you know, other than aspirational,
[00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:17.860]   it doesn't mean anything.
[00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:20.060]   Like to Apple, it is--
[00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:22.740]   other than being excited to be able to write an article that
[00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:26.500]   a scientist is re-engineering some genome or something
[00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:28.980]   like that, other than the article,
[00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:31.260]   that market is worthless to Apple,
[00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:32.780]   in the grand scheme of things.
[00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:34.780]   It gets people to code Excels.
[00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:36.180]   And yet, they still make Mac Pros,
[00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:38.020]   and they still talk about it.
[00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:38.940]   Because they're--
[00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:40.740]   But they're just a large--
[00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:41.740]   Yeah.
[00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:43.820]   There's still a lot of pros that the Mac Pro will solve.
[00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:45.020]   I don't think it's about business.
[00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:47.060]   I think it's about image.
[00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:47.380]   Yeah?
[00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:49.540]   Well, it's also important that you have to give--
[00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:52.300]   you have to give a lot of the pros the tools
[00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:54.020]   so that they don't just jump over to the PC.
[00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:55.020]   Right.
[00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:58.980]   Like, there's still-- of that top market that the Mac Pro enters,
[00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:01.860]   there's 1% that is going to have to build their own PC or Linux.
[00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:04.820]   99%, you know, just need a more powerful machine
[00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:06.780]   so they can justify using it as opposed to a PC
[00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:08.300]   because they don't want to use PCs.
[00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:11.260]   But they will if they-- so if you give them enough power--
[00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:14.300]   and I know a lot of Mac Pro users that--
[00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:18.180]   and they don't-- fundamentally, they even have PCs sitting
[00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:20.140]   on their desk, but they don't want to use them every day.
[00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:24.420]   And so they're-- they're like-- they prefer something.
[00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:27.220]   But for a lot of us, for a long time
[00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:30.380]   before the new Mac Pro came out, we were buying PCs
[00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:35.140]   because the ceiling was super low for us, where we had to just
[00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:36.300]   switch over to PC and Linux.
[00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:40.820]   And now the Mac Pro extends that ceiling pretty far up.
[00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:41.780]   Does it extend it all the way up?
[00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:43.860]   Absolutely not.
[00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:45.140]   They also pay down technologies.
[00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:48.740]   Like in 2019, we got the reprogrammable ASIC ProRes
[00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:50.980]   engines in the Mac Pro in a huge card.
[00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:52.420]   And we got the Pro Display XDR.
[00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:54.460]   And then two years later, that's in an iPhone.
[00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:55.740]   And those are the same cores.
[00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:57.060]   They just figured out how to miniaturize them
[00:27:57.060 --> 00:27:58.380]   and put them straight on the die.
[00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:00.860]   And they just figured out how to take the not quite yet mini
[00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:03.460]   LED technology and put that in the iPad.
[00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:05.100]   And they can pay that off because it's a huge price
[00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:07.620]   that-- a huge price envelope within a Mac Pro.
[00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:10.740]   So it does let them play and stretch and build a lot of stuff
[00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:12.340]   that they want to use internally and that that small
[00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:14.740]   percentage of people still want to use.
[00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:16.820]   There's weird stuff too going on.
[00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:19.620]   Somebody in the chatroom's reminding me that Asahi Linux,
[00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:22.100]   which is a Linux design specifically for the M1.
[00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:25.740]   And by the way, probably unless you really like to live
[00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:27.860]   on the bleeding edge, I wouldn't recommend.
[00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:28.780]   It's nerdy.
[00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:29.540]   It's nerdy.
[00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:31.180]   But it's an interesting project.
[00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:33.660]   And of course, a lot of Linux users are saying, boy,
[00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:35.540]   I wish I could run it on an M1.
[00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:40.420]   Compile times on Asahi here, 40 times faster than Mac OS,
[00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:43.100]   which is Bazaar.
[00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:45.500]   Maybe there's less overhead on Linux.
[00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:46.140]   I don't know.
[00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:48.500]   But that's very odd.
[00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:50.620]   It also occurs to me that the big announcements we've
[00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:53.220]   seen from the PC side of the Nvidia side
[00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:55.660]   is how BigBic can make the power supplies recently, which
[00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:58.220]   I think because they really are concerned about putting up
[00:28:58.220 --> 00:28:59.060]   performance numbers.
[00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:01.100]   They don't care at all about power efficiency numbers.
[00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:03.700]   We're talking like 800 watt power supplies.
[00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:05.300]   And Nvidia and Intel are actually
[00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:08.100]   fighting about those last percentages off a power plug.
[00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:10.340]   Because they know you only got one power plug in your office
[00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:11.180]   on the same switch.
[00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:13.460]   And they can't both be pulling 1,200 watts.
[00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:15.020]   So they're now fighting with each other.
[00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:16.660]   Who's going to get the amount of watt
[00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:18.140]   is that a normal house can provide?
[00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:19.060]   And you should hear it.
[00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:19.900]   That's the point we've gotten to.
[00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:25.820]   You should hear my Ryzen 7 3080 gaming machine.
[00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:28.780]   When I'm doing anything, it sounds like a jet taken off.
[00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:30.740]   What are you going to do with 200, 800 watt cards?
[00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:33.220]   Like you literally have to plug them into two houses.
[00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:38.060]   But if you're a pro, you're not worried about--
[00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:42.500]   all that matters is can you get it compiled or built or done
[00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:45.580]   before your coffee's cold?
[00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:46.460]   And so--
[00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:47.420]   It keeps your coffee warm.
[00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:47.940]   It's so hot.
[00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:48.460]   That's nice.
[00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:49.460]   Coffee never gets cold.
[00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:51.980]   It's all about the coffee never gets cold.
[00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:56.140]   But also, more fans is more opportunities for RGB lighting.
[00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:58.300]   And so that's true.
[00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:00.820]   That's true.
[00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:01.700]   PC.
[00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:03.220]   40% faster.
[00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:03.660]   Sorry about 40.
[00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:04.980]   Did I say 40 times faster?
[00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:05.540]   That was an error.
[00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:06.540]   40% faster.
[00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:10.060]   Still, 40% faster compilation.
[00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:13.620]   To me, it's not enough to get a saihelinics on your Mac,
[00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:14.420]   on your beautiful--
[00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:15.500]   Oh, by this time next week, you'll
[00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:17.260]   be telling us that you're running it on the machine
[00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:17.860]   in front of you, Leo.
[00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:19.020]   Yeah, no, I thought about it.
[00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:20.460]   I decided not to.
[00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:23.380]   I decided not to.
[00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:25.860]   All right, let's take a little break.
[00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:27.260]   Actually, I'm curious when we come back,
[00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:29.900]   if there's anything else to look for June 6th.
[00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:33.180]   And a reminder, June 6th, 10 AM, that's
[00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:34.820]   going to be the WWDC keynote.
[00:30:34.820 --> 00:30:38.220]   Of course, Mike is Sergeant, and I will stream it live,
[00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:39.740]   as always.
[00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:42.500]   Or you can watch office hours with a bunch of geeks going,
[00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:44.780]   ooh, whoa.
[00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:46.540]   But that's going to be exciting.
[00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:47.460]   You can be a lot of always watching
[00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:47.980]   them up.
[00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:48.500]   Watch them up.
[00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:48.780]   Two months off.
[00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:50.940]   We've got plenty of time to prepare.
[00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:52.260]   But what else might they announce?
[00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:54.380]   We'll talk about that in a second.
[00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:58.020]   Our show today brought to you by our crowd,
[00:30:58.020 --> 00:31:04.500]   a venture capital group that opens the door to you and me
[00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:07.900]   to get in in the early stages of these investments.
[00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:10.180]   I don't know about you, but often I'm watching, I look,
[00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:11.860]   and I say, oh, wow.
[00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:14.500]   If only I could be an early stage investor.
[00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:17.980]   You know, we're talking about companies that are not public.
[00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:20.060]   There's maybe even still in the garages,
[00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:22.980]   but our show huge promise.
[00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:24.900]   That's what our crowd's all about.
[00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:28.460]   These are venture capitalists who look for deals like that
[00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:31.660]   across the broad global private sector,
[00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:34.900]   looking for opportunities for the greatest growth.
[00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:37.500]   But what's different is they don't keep it to themselves.
[00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:40.420]   They bring them to you from personalized medicine
[00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:43.700]   to cybersecurity, to open source intelligence,
[00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:46.060]   a multi-billion dollar and growing market.
[00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:48.660]   Our crowd is identifying innovators
[00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:51.460]   so you can invest when the growth potential is the greatest
[00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:54.940]   early before the IPO, before the exit.
[00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:56.940]   Now, you have to be an accredited investor to do this.
[00:31:56.940 --> 00:31:58.500]   This is not for everybody.
[00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:02.020]   But if you satisfy the requirements in every country
[00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:07.780]   is different, you can get involved with these incredible
[00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:09.020]   opportunities.
[00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:11.220]   Our crowd's accredited investors have already invested
[00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:13.980]   over a billion dollars in growing tech companies.
[00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:18.140]   21 of our crowd's portfolio companies are unicorns.
[00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:22.860]   They have had 40 exits, IPOs or sales of portfolio companies.
[00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:26.540]   That's usually when the dollars start rolling in.
[00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:28.900]   If you're an accredited investor, there's two ways
[00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:29.780]   you can participate.
[00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:32.540]   You can buy in on single company deals.
[00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:34.740]   If you see something you go, this is amazing.
[00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:36.340]   But you don't have to have millions of dollars.
[00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:37.460]   You don't have to write that big check
[00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:38.700]   or even hundreds of thousands.
[00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:41.420]   You can buy in with as little as $10,000.
[00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:42.820]   If you want to get involved in the funds,
[00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:44.580]   which aggregate a bunch of deals together
[00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:46.220]   and they have some really interesting funds,
[00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:48.300]   $50,000 is the minimum investment.
[00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:51.700]   But once again, a minimum of $10,000 is required to invest.
[00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:54.860]   The terms will vary depending on what country you're in.
[00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:56.700]   So what you want to do, and it's free to do this,
[00:32:56.700 --> 00:33:00.420]   is go to ourcrowd.com/macbreak.
[00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:02.980]   And it's free to join and they will tell you
[00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:04.260]   what the requirements are.
[00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:09.260]   O-U-R-C-R-O-W-D.com/macbreak.
[00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:15.500]   We were talking about this open source intelligence market.
[00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:19.860]   Here's an example investment right now at our crowd, C-A-BRA.
[00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:22.740]   They have AI powered SaaS platforms
[00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:25.900]   analyzing billions of online conversations.
[00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:29.340]   Why will companies want to get authentic consumer insights
[00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:33.260]   and fight disinformation in real time?
[00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:36.220]   In fact, there are a bunch of big global media giants
[00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:37.540]   trusting C-A-BRA.
[00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:40.660]   Their consumer brands are high level government agencies.
[00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:44.900]   And now you can invest at our crowd.
[00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:46.300]   Isn't that exciting?
[00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:47.660]   Isn't that exciting?
[00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:51.300]   Our crowd, actually does it say it's closed?
[00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:54.140]   That's all right, that's just an example.
[00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:55.980]   Next one, coming up soon.
[00:33:55.980 --> 00:34:00.820]   Invest at our crowd, O-U-R-C-R-O-W-D.com/macbreak.
[00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:02.180]   That's how fast this moves.
[00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:06.620]   It's free to join, and it's worth it just for the information
[00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:07.820]   you're gonna get from this.
[00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:10.100]   ourcrowd.com/macbreak.
[00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:14.060]   Join the fastest growing venture capital investment community.
[00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:15.940]   O-U-R-C-R-O-W-D.
[00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:19.820]   Our crowd.com/macbreak.
[00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:22.540]   Thank you so much for supporting Mac Break.
[00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:25.260]   Weekly use that address so that you support us back
[00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:27.300]   so they know you saw it here.
[00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:29.260]   Thank you, our crowd.
[00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:31.740]   Anything else that we might see?
[00:34:31.740 --> 00:34:35.100]   What is Apple Labs, and usually it has its laptops
[00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:37.580]   at WWDC too, right?
[00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:39.100]   They sometimes do hardware.
[00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:40.300]   They don't always do hardware.
[00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:42.100]   It's about half and half, 2017.
[00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:43.460]   They didn't have a spring event.
[00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:44.820]   So they did all the hardware,
[00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:46.780]   like literally all the hardware.
[00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:48.260]   Last year there was no hardware.
[00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:50.020]   So it really goes up and down.
[00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:51.220]   It depends what's ready.
[00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:52.740]   My guess is Mac Pro.
[00:34:52.740 --> 00:34:53.500]   Yeah.
[00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:54.340]   That's my guess.
[00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:55.340]   They did announce an awful lot of stuff.
[00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:56.340]   Maybe XDR.
[00:34:56.340 --> 00:34:58.140]   Already this year.
[00:34:58.140 --> 00:34:59.460]   So.
[00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:01.260]   And I'm hoping the XDR display part two,
[00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:02.100]   where they have like,
[00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:04.500]   I don't want it to be 7K for 7K Leo.
[00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:05.860]   I really, really don't.
[00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:07.660]   But some of the technologies we're hearing about
[00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:12.180]   like 36 inch, 7K mini LED display.
[00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:14.180]   And I know people still want promotion on it
[00:35:14.180 --> 00:35:16.140]   because you know why pay less.
[00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:18.500]   So I'm just gritting my teeth and waiting.
[00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:19.020]   Oh, dear.
[00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:20.940]   Speaking of which, a weird thing happened
[00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:24.380]   on the way to moderate 12.3.1.
[00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:30.060]   Lisa, I updated fine on my Mac studio, Macs.
[00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:32.260]   As you know, Lisa has an ultra.
[00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:33.340]   She says, what's going on?
[00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:34.060]   I can't update.
[00:35:34.060 --> 00:35:35.980]   I said, I came in and I said, what do you mean?
[00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:38.620]   It says, you don't have, your studio display is not attached.
[00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:40.940]   So would you please attach your studio display
[00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:43.980]   so we can update both at the same time.
[00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:45.380]   And then when I clicked,
[00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:47.380]   OK, it said, no, no, no, attach.
[00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:48.700]   We don't have a studio display.
[00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:52.660]   There's this Mac has never had a studio display attached.
[00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:55.220]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:59.740]   Yes, it has here at the studio when we first unboxed it.
[00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:05.180]   So do you think it remembers seeing a studio display
[00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:07.660]   and says, no, no, because what I ended up having to do
[00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:10.660]   is you know, there's a for more information or more details.
[00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:13.020]   You click that box and then you get both updates,
[00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:15.580]   12.31 plus studio display update.
[00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:17.900]   And I uncheck the studio display, I said, OK,
[00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:20.460]   it's still complained and then it did it.
[00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:25.340]   So it must have seen that I had only once months ago,
[00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:27.780]   weeks ago, connected it to a studio display.
[00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:33.740]   That's weird because I didn't have that problem with my ultra.
[00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:35.380]   Huh.
[00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:36.700]   OK.
[00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:39.900]   Now that I've answered my own question,
[00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:42.180]   it's strange, though, that it remembers that.
[00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:45.020]   I guess they really want to update the studio display.
[00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:46.380]   What's in the update, Renee?
[00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:49.060]   Anything important?
[00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:52.420]   No, it's just-- it's not the bug fix we're waiting for either,
[00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:54.260]   just to fix that camera.
[00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:56.020]   So it came with a review unit.
[00:36:56.020 --> 00:36:57.820]   You put it in and it fixed it right away.
[00:36:57.820 --> 00:36:59.700]   So I have no experience of what it did before then.
[00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:01.380]   Maybe it was just the whole screen was yellow.
[00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:01.980]   OK.
[00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:03.460]   So there is something.
[00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:07.180]   There is some sort of update.
[00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:10.460]   Yeah, we updated the studio display when we unboxed it.
[00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:11.220]   We updated it.
[00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:13.180]   So it must-- it is something new.
[00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:15.820]   I would love to see aggressive updates for this.
[00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:17.820]   I think we talked about this, but AirPods have been getting
[00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:18.820]   new features every year.
[00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:23.020]   They got spatial audio, conversation, boost, find my--
[00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:23.700]   every dub dub.
[00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:26.060]   They're treated like another piece of hardware that gets updates.
[00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:28.700]   And I would love to see studio display come up and say, OK,
[00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:31.580]   for you omega level Apple nerds who bought two of them,
[00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:33.100]   we're going to let you do a stereo pairing.
[00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:33.620]   Oh, with that, please.
[00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:36.220]   Like, home pods so you can have a wider sound stay.
[00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:37.300]   I just-- it breaks my heart.
[00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:37.780]   There's no what?
[00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:39.820]   Because we saw the unboxing now from--
[00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:41.700]   sorry, the tear down from my fix it.
[00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:42.620]   It just breaks my heart.
[00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:45.220]   The one thing Apple doesn't cram Wi-Fi into is this,
[00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:48.320]   because I would love wireless airplay and wireless side
[00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:49.060]   card is built in.
[00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:49.420]   You do want--
[00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:50.900]   I know it makes no sense because like a Mac
[00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:52.540]   will do that automatically, but I just want to--
[00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:54.260]   You do want to get 1231.
[00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:58.700]   You also want to get 1541 for iOS because they are zero days
[00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:02.100]   that Apple is fixing.
[00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:05.980]   I don't know how--
[00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:08.820]   an application may be able to execute arbitrary code
[00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:10.220]   with kernel privileges.
[00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:11.860]   The Macs are pretty locked down right now.
[00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:15.020]   For instance, I wrote a program at home,
[00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:18.780]   compiled it on my studio at home,
[00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:19.340]   sent it in.
[00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:22.020]   I couldn't run it on my mini here.
[00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:25.260]   I had to re-combilate here to say, oh, no, no.
[00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:27.420]   And look, it's my program.
[00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:32.500]   So they're pretty good about unsigned stuff, right?
[00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:35.420]   There's an update for the Intel graphics driver,
[00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:37.820]   if you have an Intel Mac as well that
[00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:39.620]   allows an application to read kernel memory.
[00:38:39.620 --> 00:38:42.420]   So as always, you want to fix them.
[00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:44.860]   The 1541 on iOS fixes an issue that
[00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:47.140]   could drain the batteries of iPhones and iPads more
[00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:49.860]   quickly than expected.
[00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:52.700]   1231 fixes an issue that could cause Bluetooth devices
[00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:54.740]   to unexpectedly disconnect from the Mac.
[00:38:54.740 --> 00:38:56.100]   Well, I thought that was a feature.
[00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:58.580]   That happens all the time.
[00:38:58.580 --> 00:38:59.060]   OK.
[00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:01.020]   You think like if Elon bought 9% of Apple,
[00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:02.300]   he could just fix all this stuff?
[00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:03.580]   Like, we'll just never have a bug again.
[00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:07.020]   Oh, I cannot wait to see what happens at Twitter now.
[00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:10.780]   You're referring to the fact that on Friday, it came out--
[00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:12.340]   or actually it came out late Sunday
[00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:13.700]   because we missed it on Twitter.
[00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:15.140]   No, no, I guess we had it on Twitter.
[00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:19.300]   Elon had bought a huge stake, $3 billion stake in Twitter.
[00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:23.260]   This morning, Twitter announced he's been added to the board.
[00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:23.780]   But maybe--
[00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:25.300]   It's not timeline, Leo.
[00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:25.820]   Maybe it's not that.
[00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:26.700]   It's that timeline.
[00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:29.700]   It may be a defensive update because when you're on the board,
[00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:33.900]   you can only buy up to 14.5% of the stock.
[00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:35.660]   Well, you know what they say, keep your friends close
[00:39:35.660 --> 00:39:36.980]   and your enemies close.
[00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:37.900]   Exactly.
[00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:41.500]   He mentioned that he was going to build a new Twitter
[00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:44.540]   and it didn't take very long for him to end up on Twitter.
[00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:45.980]   Very interesting.
[00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:47.020]   It's very interesting.
[00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:51.940]   Can I give a shout out to Lauren Hirsch and Mike Isaac,
[00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:55.860]   New York Times, posted a story about all that yesterday
[00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:59.740]   and had one of the best lines I've seen in tech writing ever.
[00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:04.940]   That Elon Musk is putting his money where he mouth saw.
[00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:06.300]   And I'm like, oh.
[00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:08.300]   Exactly right.
[00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:09.500]   Apparently, he's still going to have
[00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:11.220]   to abide by the terms and conditions.
[00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:12.620]   They did say that quite plainly.
[00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:13.140]   The market--
[00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:13.740]   No, market.
[00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:16.460]   The market boosted Twitter's price of 20%.
[00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:18.780]   Maybe what might happen is he says, oh, good.
[00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:19.260]   Thank you.
[00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:21.780]   Thank you for the $300 million buy.
[00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:23.020]   And Jack was happy.
[00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:23.860]   Jack was happy.
[00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:25.860]   Yeah.
[00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:28.260]   Let's see what else.
[00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:32.260]   TVOS 1541, WatchOS 851.
[00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:35.300]   So updates across the board, often these
[00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:37.220]   are all related security updates.
[00:40:37.220 --> 00:40:39.340]   Yeah.
[00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:39.820]   Safari.
[00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:40.500]   You've applied platform.
[00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:41.820]   You've applied security updates.
[00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:42.180]   Yeah.
[00:40:42.180 --> 00:40:43.820]   Yeah.
[00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:45.580]   Safari 15.4.
[00:40:45.580 --> 00:40:47.180]   That was last month.
[00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:48.780]   So I'm just looking at the other updates.
[00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:49.260]   OK.
[00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:50.820]   I don't know if you've been following it, Leo.
[00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:52.260]   But the Safari evangelists on Twitter
[00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:54.940]   have been much more active in soliciting feedback
[00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:56.900]   and building community and getting people
[00:40:56.900 --> 00:40:58.780]   to talk about the features that they want,
[00:40:58.780 --> 00:41:01.060]   what they're going to support, and being much more transparent,
[00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:03.500]   or the web kit side at least being much more transparent
[00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:04.540]   about what they're building and why
[00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:05.540]   and their thought processes.
[00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:06.580]   And I find it really refreshing.
[00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:07.340]   Yeah.
[00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:07.980]   It's interesting.
[00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:09.220]   Maybe they're a little bit hungry,
[00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:11.740]   because I think it was just today or yesterday
[00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:15.300]   that latest stats on web browser saturation
[00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:19.180]   is that Edge actually surpassed Safari for the first time
[00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:24.220]   in user installs or whatever the metric is.
[00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:26.020]   It was like a solid metric of more people
[00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:28.540]   are now using Edge than Safari, which I find
[00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:31.860]   very, very interesting, because last year, another piece
[00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:34.260]   of-- another very interesting statistic
[00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:37.660]   was that reported by Google, but verified by outsiders,
[00:41:37.660 --> 00:41:43.380]   was that most of the searches for Google Chrome
[00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:45.420]   come from Microsoft Edge.
[00:41:45.420 --> 00:41:48.140]   So basically, people are launching Microsoft Edge
[00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:49.580]   for the first time in their new machines,
[00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:51.780]   using that to download and install Chrome,
[00:41:51.780 --> 00:41:54.180]   and then they never use Edge again.
[00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:54.980]   That's desktop, right?
[00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:56.620]   Because I imagine mobile Safari still is a huge--
[00:41:56.620 --> 00:41:57.460]   Exactly.
[00:41:57.460 --> 00:41:59.020]   Oh, no, absolutely.
[00:41:59.020 --> 00:42:01.100]   Well, you don't have a choice, really.
[00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:02.380]   There was a big kerfuffle, though.
[00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:04.820]   There was a fight when they had some open source contributions
[00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:08.100]   to WebKit and a couple Chrome engineers that really not--
[00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:10.260]   that's kind of beneath Apple to use free contributions
[00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:12.300]   from the open source community.
[00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:13.180]   You're a company.
[00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:13.860]   You shouldn't do that.
[00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:15.340]   And then they're like, if we didn't do it,
[00:42:15.340 --> 00:42:17.980]   you'd accuse us of not taking contributions from the community.
[00:42:17.980 --> 00:42:19.020]   You can't win.
[00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:21.580]   They had a huge evangelist fight.
[00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:23.100]   Evangelist fight.
[00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:25.220]   So Apple did not, though.
[00:42:25.220 --> 00:42:27.060]   I don't know if this is a sign of the times.
[00:42:27.060 --> 00:42:30.900]   Apply that patch to Big Sur or Catalina.
[00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:35.900]   So those two so-called actively exploited zero days
[00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:39.100]   are not patched, at least so far.
[00:42:39.100 --> 00:42:42.700]   Is it possible that they've decided these are so old?
[00:42:42.700 --> 00:42:44.220]   We're not going to patch them?
[00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:45.620]   Or is it more likely that they're just
[00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:47.260]   taking a little longer to get the patches out?
[00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:48.900]   What do you think, Renee?
[00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:49.940]   I hope the latter.
[00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:52.060]   I mean, they usually are fairly good about updating
[00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:53.940]   at least a couple of generations back.
[00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:55.260]   And those are really necessary things.
[00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:57.540]   People still have hardware that can't always update.
[00:42:57.540 --> 00:43:00.700]   So hopefully it's just their launch process.
[00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:04.300]   In fact, that's why I bought the M1 Mac Mini and the Mac
[00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:08.900]   Studio, because we had two 2014 iMacs that could not
[00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:11.620]   get passed, that could not go to Monterey.
[00:43:11.620 --> 00:43:13.820]   And it was an interesting email from Craig Federighi
[00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:16.020]   when someone was asking why it was taking so long for updates.
[00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:18.420]   And he's like, well, you can press the button at any time.
[00:43:18.420 --> 00:43:21.220]   But otherwise, we test and we see and we test and we see.
[00:43:21.220 --> 00:43:24.180]   And then from like one to six weeks or something for everybody.
[00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:24.540]   Good.
[00:43:24.540 --> 00:43:25.220]   That's fine.
[00:43:25.220 --> 00:43:27.460]   I thought that was specifically--
[00:43:27.460 --> 00:43:30.580]   I thought that was a very, very smart mechanism where,
[00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:32.580]   essentially, if you ask for the update,
[00:43:32.580 --> 00:43:34.020]   you will get it immediately.
[00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:36.460]   If you don't ask for it, they figure, OK,
[00:43:36.460 --> 00:43:38.100]   they're not very hot to trot.
[00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:39.140]   Let's wait a few days.
[00:43:39.140 --> 00:43:40.980]   Let's wait a week or two, basically
[00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:42.980]   to balance the load and also just in case
[00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:47.180]   where something horrible is slouching towards Bethlehem
[00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:49.260]   to be born.
[00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:53.020]   Interestingly, even if you don't update your M1--
[00:43:53.020 --> 00:43:55.780]   I don't know how you gain M1 running Big Sur,
[00:43:55.780 --> 00:43:56.980]   because they can--
[00:43:56.980 --> 00:43:59.420]   I guess an older M1 might be still running Big Sur.
[00:43:59.420 --> 00:44:00.500]   They're still vulnerable.
[00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:05.060]   So you definitely want to update.
[00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:08.420]   And if you are running older hardware that you can't update,
[00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:10.300]   I don't know what to say.
[00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:11.260]   You'll like the M1.
[00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:15.980]   Come on in.
[00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:18.100]   Get Chrome OS on that thing.
[00:44:18.100 --> 00:44:18.780]   It's free.
[00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:20.780]   You just got to put it on a 32 gig--
[00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:21.300]   There you go.
[00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:21.620]   --end realistic.
[00:44:21.620 --> 00:44:22.740]   And there you go.
[00:44:22.740 --> 00:44:23.740]   You'll get the latest browser.
[00:44:23.740 --> 00:44:24.940]   It'll be all the security updates.
[00:44:24.940 --> 00:44:29.580]   And Tego estimates that 35% to 40% of all the Macs--
[00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:31.900]   and this is an estimate, because Apple doesn't say--
[00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:34.460]   all the Macs in use today are affected by one or both
[00:44:34.460 --> 00:44:37.340]   of the new of these zero days.
[00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:40.020]   So that's a pretty hefty number.
[00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:40.820]   And once they're coming--
[00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:42.140]   They're just closed doing this open season.
[00:44:42.140 --> 00:44:43.140]   Yeah.
[00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:45.100]   And these are coming fast and furious.
[00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:47.980]   I mean, Google had two so far this year.
[00:44:47.980 --> 00:44:50.940]   And not just like the OK, we're rushing this out,
[00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:52.060]   but no critical.
[00:44:52.060 --> 00:44:54.340]   We're not telling anybody what this thing does
[00:44:54.340 --> 00:44:56.860]   until we actually go these patches out twice.
[00:44:56.860 --> 00:44:59.980]   And it's only-- and it's only start of April.
[00:44:59.980 --> 00:45:02.100]   We'll keep an eye on that one.
[00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:06.700]   And let you know if they do update Pixar or don't.
[00:45:06.700 --> 00:45:08.420]   I think in either case, that's a big deal.
[00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:13.700]   Let's see.
[00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:15.500]   What else?
[00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:17.260]   Neil Sybar, I should do.
[00:45:17.260 --> 00:45:20.140]   We mentioned this on Twitter as well.
[00:45:20.140 --> 00:45:22.740]   Apple is in a league of its own.
[00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:24.420]   Neil has talked before about Apple.
[00:45:24.420 --> 00:45:27.500]   Apple used to have a pull strategy,
[00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:31.060]   where the most popular best-selling devices would pull along
[00:45:31.060 --> 00:45:34.140]   like the iPhone, would pull along the rest of them
[00:45:34.140 --> 00:45:35.500]   like the Mac.
[00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:38.220]   And he says, I'm curious what you all think,
[00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:41.820]   that now they have a push system in which every major product
[00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:44.900]   category is pushed forward simultaneously.
[00:45:44.900 --> 00:45:48.500]   I have to say, as a Mac user, I'm glad that they have kept
[00:45:48.500 --> 00:45:49.140]   the Mac up.
[00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:50.500]   Is that-- you think--
[00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:52.180]   an internal choice that they've made,
[00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:53.540]   or is it just something Neil's observed?
[00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:54.580]   I don't think that's new.
[00:45:54.580 --> 00:45:56.100]   I think it just took--
[00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:57.820]   the Schiller Doctrine is pretty famous now.
[00:45:57.820 --> 00:46:00.060]   There's that famous slide of all the different screens.
[00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:02.820]   And Phil really believed that every device
[00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:04.860]   had to fight for survival.
[00:46:04.860 --> 00:46:06.940]   They do not care if they cannibalized stuff.
[00:46:06.940 --> 00:46:08.180]   And it'll go back and forth.
[00:46:08.180 --> 00:46:10.420]   But the iPhone has to become so good people
[00:46:10.420 --> 00:46:11.220]   don't need an iPad.
[00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:13.460]   The iPad has to be so good people don't need a Mac.
[00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:16.500]   The Mac has to be so good they don't need a desktop Mac.
[00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:18.340]   And then it's the job of all of those devices
[00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:21.020]   to push back, to fight, to prove they have a right
[00:46:21.020 --> 00:46:22.340]   to keep existing.
[00:46:22.340 --> 00:46:25.180]   And they've made-- they've fallen off on that over the years.
[00:46:25.180 --> 00:46:26.740]   I think they just got--
[00:46:26.740 --> 00:46:28.900]   they were juggling too many things at one time.
[00:46:28.900 --> 00:46:31.860]   It didn't have a clear Mac direction before Apple Silicon.
[00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:33.180]   But that's supposed to be the goal.
[00:46:33.180 --> 00:46:34.940]   And that really feels like what they're doing now.
[00:46:34.940 --> 00:46:36.460]   Because iPad Pro is so good.
[00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:39.060]   And the new M1 Macs are so good that they really
[00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:40.660]   are driving them forward.
[00:46:40.660 --> 00:46:43.060]   It's just somebody tweet, come on Apple.
[00:46:43.060 --> 00:46:45.260]   Make a dual boat boat iPad.
[00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:46.460]   Why can't we run a--
[00:46:46.460 --> 00:46:48.020]   they're all M1s now.
[00:46:48.020 --> 00:46:50.220]   Why can't we run Mac OS on our iPad?
[00:46:50.220 --> 00:46:52.220]   There's another time to make it finger friendly.
[00:46:52.220 --> 00:46:53.820]   That would take like windows took three years to--
[00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:54.340]   That's why.
[00:46:54.340 --> 00:46:55.700]   Right, actually transition, yeah.
[00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:56.380]   You could run.
[00:46:56.380 --> 00:46:58.780]   I mean, you got the hardware to run Mac OS.
[00:46:58.780 --> 00:47:01.300]   With a pencil, Apple Pencil would let you run it.
[00:47:01.300 --> 00:47:04.500]   Because you can hit those small targets.
[00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:07.500]   Yeah, I think that Apple also, one of the big advantages
[00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:09.220]   they have as they keep moving forward
[00:47:09.220 --> 00:47:11.140]   is this integration between all the heart,
[00:47:11.140 --> 00:47:12.780]   within all of those things.
[00:47:12.780 --> 00:47:14.740]   That integration doesn't always work.
[00:47:14.740 --> 00:47:18.780]   Airpods are kind of generally a burning dumpster fire
[00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:20.940]   of connectivity, where they're constantly
[00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:22.060]   jumping to different things.
[00:47:22.060 --> 00:47:25.900]   And you have to really tamp that down manually.
[00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:27.940]   It just works doesn't really extend to the Airpods,
[00:47:27.940 --> 00:47:28.940]   in my opinion.
[00:47:28.940 --> 00:47:32.060]   Like if you actually have a lot of devices, which I do.
[00:47:32.060 --> 00:47:35.500]   But outside of that exception, I think Apple's doing--
[00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:38.460]   they just keep tying all these devices together tighter
[00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:41.020]   and tighter and tighter to where that experience is so
[00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:45.060]   fluid across all of them, that it's really,
[00:47:45.060 --> 00:47:48.260]   as an ecosystem, it's hard to not be in the ecosystem.
[00:47:48.260 --> 00:47:50.380]   It's hard to add something to it,
[00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:54.660]   because it's just going to be this kind of slug.
[00:47:54.660 --> 00:47:59.180]   If you get a different watch or a different phone
[00:47:59.180 --> 00:47:59.700]   or a different--
[00:47:59.700 --> 00:48:04.540]   Lisa was really interested in my Z Flip, my Galaxy Z Flip,
[00:48:04.540 --> 00:48:06.380]   which is a great little phone.
[00:48:06.380 --> 00:48:08.380]   And I said, well, before I said it to Stacey,
[00:48:08.380 --> 00:48:11.340]   you want to try it and see if you want it.
[00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:15.300]   And I said, but it won't work with your Apple watch.
[00:48:15.300 --> 00:48:16.020]   And that was it.
[00:48:16.020 --> 00:48:18.140]   It was like, no, I'm not going to do it.
[00:48:18.140 --> 00:48:19.420]   Where's the AirDrop button?
[00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:19.900]   Yeah.
[00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:20.260]   Right.
[00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:21.260]   Not going to do it.
[00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:24.060]   So I think there's really strong lock-in, really.
[00:48:24.060 --> 00:48:26.540]   If once you've got a few Apple products,
[00:48:26.540 --> 00:48:28.700]   you're loath to go anywhere else.
[00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:31.180]   Yeah.
[00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:33.900]   Speaking of Airpods, as you probably know,
[00:48:33.900 --> 00:48:38.180]   the FDA is moving quickly towards making hearing aids
[00:48:38.180 --> 00:48:43.260]   an over-the-counter device, which would be a huge shift.
[00:48:43.260 --> 00:48:45.140]   It's a very expensive right now.
[00:48:45.140 --> 00:48:47.340]   Hearing aids are thousands of dollars.
[00:48:47.340 --> 00:48:50.820]   My hearing aids were $6,000 and included--
[00:48:50.820 --> 00:48:53.300]   that did not include the cost of going to an audiologist
[00:48:53.300 --> 00:48:56.100]   to get them, fitted and all of that.
[00:48:56.100 --> 00:49:00.700]   But as we go towards this OTC hearing aid market,
[00:49:00.700 --> 00:49:02.340]   I think Apple will be well positioned.
[00:49:02.340 --> 00:49:06.340]   There's a company called Olive Union
[00:49:06.340 --> 00:49:09.540]   that is now starting to take orders for what really kind of
[00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:12.540]   almost looks a little bit like an AirPod.
[00:49:12.540 --> 00:49:16.740]   The Olive Max hearing aids, they double as a pair of earbuds.
[00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:18.540]   But they are hearing aids that, in fact,
[00:49:18.540 --> 00:49:21.540]   adjust to your hearing issues.
[00:49:21.540 --> 00:49:24.060]   They adapt to the situation you're in.
[00:49:24.060 --> 00:49:27.140]   They look a lot like regular earbuds.
[00:49:27.140 --> 00:49:29.300]   They're on pre-order right now.
[00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:30.500]   I think it's on Indiegogo.
[00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:32.260]   Yeah.
[00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:33.780]   They're actually not--
[00:49:33.780 --> 00:49:38.220]   Remember, $6,000 for a pair of hearing aids, $299.
[00:49:38.220 --> 00:49:40.140]   They will be $550.
[00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:41.820]   Well, that's thanks to the FDA.
[00:49:41.820 --> 00:49:43.180]   They're at a-- I think they started
[00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:45.420]   the six or eight years ago sometime during the Obama
[00:49:45.420 --> 00:49:45.980]   administration.
[00:49:45.980 --> 00:49:49.300]   I think it was that they decided that technology is evolving
[00:49:49.300 --> 00:49:53.620]   at the point where they can start to question whether certain
[00:49:53.620 --> 00:49:58.580]   technologically-based therapies require the use of--
[00:49:58.580 --> 00:50:00.820]   require the involvement of a doctor,
[00:50:00.820 --> 00:50:02.700]   require the use of prescription, and maybe they
[00:50:02.700 --> 00:50:05.380]   could be converted from medical devices
[00:50:05.380 --> 00:50:06.340]   into consumer devices.
[00:50:06.340 --> 00:50:09.260]   And one of the first things that qualified under this program
[00:50:09.260 --> 00:50:10.220]   were hearing aids.
[00:50:10.220 --> 00:50:11.300]   And you're absolutely right.
[00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:13.500]   I mean, we can walk into any drugstore
[00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:15.980]   and buy a pair of reading glasses
[00:50:15.980 --> 00:50:18.780]   and just simply just keep swapping glasses until we find
[00:50:18.780 --> 00:50:19.900]   when the actually works walk out.
[00:50:19.900 --> 00:50:21.620]   We're happy that's $10.
[00:50:21.620 --> 00:50:23.780]   And the ability to do that for people
[00:50:23.780 --> 00:50:25.700]   who have simple hearing problems that
[00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:28.300]   could be addressed this for $300 to $600 instead
[00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:31.620]   of $3,000 to $6,000, that is real power.
[00:50:31.620 --> 00:50:36.580]   That's the one of the cases where politics and technology
[00:50:36.580 --> 00:50:42.300]   work well together, realizing that no one's going to be hurt.
[00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:44.220]   So long as these things are certified, as long as these things
[00:50:44.220 --> 00:50:47.300]   are actually working to do what this says on the label,
[00:50:47.300 --> 00:50:50.220]   this is such a big, big step forward for health.
[00:50:50.220 --> 00:50:52.500]   It hasn't happened yet.
[00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:52.980]   You're right.
[00:50:52.980 --> 00:50:58.940]   It was 2017 that this was part of the FDA Reauthorization Act.
[00:50:58.940 --> 00:51:01.220]   FDA says right now, as of this time,
[00:51:01.220 --> 00:51:03.220]   there are no products that can be legally marketed
[00:51:03.220 --> 00:51:05.340]   as over the kind of hearing aids.
[00:51:05.340 --> 00:51:09.100]   But if it was their intent to get this to happen sooner than later,
[00:51:09.100 --> 00:51:11.140]   obviously the lobbyists have kicked in.
[00:51:11.140 --> 00:51:12.460]   Yeah.
[00:51:12.460 --> 00:51:13.860]   So I don't--
[00:51:13.860 --> 00:51:16.780]   Well, I think that the problem is the current hearing aid
[00:51:16.780 --> 00:51:18.620]   companies are going to have a hard time surviving
[00:51:18.620 --> 00:51:20.220]   against consumer companies.
[00:51:20.220 --> 00:51:24.020]   And so there's also a lot of audiologist set of business.
[00:51:24.020 --> 00:51:26.900]   Yeah, because the reality is that Apple's and many others,
[00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:31.420]   transparency mode, is really something that doesn't take very
[00:51:31.420 --> 00:51:33.620]   much to say, well, we're going to use those mics,
[00:51:33.620 --> 00:51:34.380]   give them back to you.
[00:51:34.380 --> 00:51:35.740]   I mean, you could end up with just a lot of people
[00:51:35.740 --> 00:51:38.660]   that-- what's interesting is that it just gets to--
[00:51:38.660 --> 00:51:40.540]   it also doesn't have the same stigma
[00:51:40.540 --> 00:51:42.940]   that it used to have of having those hearing aids.
[00:51:42.940 --> 00:51:44.220]   I don't know how much stigma there is now.
[00:51:44.220 --> 00:51:46.500]   I know so many people with hearing aids at this point.
[00:51:46.500 --> 00:51:47.980]   But it is--
[00:51:47.980 --> 00:51:51.020]   It's funny because I agree that there isn't really a stigma.
[00:51:51.020 --> 00:51:54.100]   But for a lot of people, they think there is, right?
[00:51:54.100 --> 00:51:56.860]   So there is definitely resistance to wearing a hearing aid.
[00:51:56.860 --> 00:52:00.940]   Maybe it's just the acknowledgment I'm getting old that people
[00:52:00.940 --> 00:52:02.420]   don't want to do.
[00:52:02.420 --> 00:52:04.860]   So there's a big problem.
[00:52:04.860 --> 00:52:07.180]   I think from battery life, though, especially if we get
[00:52:07.180 --> 00:52:09.020]   something with bigger batteries and so on and so forth,
[00:52:09.020 --> 00:52:09.740]   I can see myself.
[00:52:09.740 --> 00:52:12.260]   I think that the other thing that's happening is there's
[00:52:12.260 --> 00:52:14.660]   this mixture of an earpiece--
[00:52:14.660 --> 00:52:16.580]   we'll just not call it a hearing aid or a headphone.
[00:52:16.580 --> 00:52:19.500]   But an earpiece that we put in that is, again,
[00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:21.580]   it connects us to our AR.
[00:52:21.580 --> 00:52:25.860]   It connects us to seamlessly being part of a phone call.
[00:52:25.860 --> 00:52:28.900]   It might amplify things around us or turn it off.
[00:52:28.900 --> 00:52:31.860]   And it kind of is something that we wear from the time we
[00:52:31.860 --> 00:52:32.860]   get up until the time we go to bed.
[00:52:32.860 --> 00:52:35.060]   Now, we can all decide whether that's a good idea or not.
[00:52:35.060 --> 00:52:37.940]   But the point is, from an auditory perspective,
[00:52:37.940 --> 00:52:42.300]   it could be tying us to a virtual world or the rest of the world
[00:52:42.300 --> 00:52:45.380]   all the time, where it's always in your ear.
[00:52:45.380 --> 00:52:48.460]   And I have to admit, when I first started thinking about this,
[00:52:48.460 --> 00:52:49.420]   it was like 25 years ago.
[00:52:49.420 --> 00:52:51.340]   And I was working at i11.
[00:52:51.340 --> 00:52:52.820]   I didn't want to pick up the phone.
[00:52:52.820 --> 00:52:54.380]   I just wanted to listen to my music.
[00:52:54.380 --> 00:52:55.380]   I could say, I'm rang.
[00:52:55.380 --> 00:52:56.980]   I could answer it and then go back to what I was doing.
[00:52:56.980 --> 00:52:57.980]   It got that now.
[00:52:57.980 --> 00:52:58.980]   It wasn't any really good.
[00:52:58.980 --> 00:52:59.980]   Yeah, no.
[00:52:59.980 --> 00:53:00.980]   It got your dream.
[00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:01.980]   And that's the whole thing.
[00:53:01.980 --> 00:53:03.780]   But I think that being able to say, oh, at this moment,
[00:53:03.780 --> 00:53:06.380]   I would like to amplify what's around me so I could really
[00:53:06.380 --> 00:53:08.780]   hear it, or at this moment, I would like to turn that off.
[00:53:08.780 --> 00:53:11.180]   And being able to just decide what you're doing there
[00:53:11.180 --> 00:53:12.380]   is pretty interesting.
[00:53:12.380 --> 00:53:13.380]   Yeah.
[00:53:13.380 --> 00:53:15.780]   No, just the idea of having a phone that has a pretty
[00:53:15.780 --> 00:53:17.780]   sophisticated microphone array built into it,
[00:53:17.780 --> 00:53:20.980]   being able to put that on the desk or put it on the table
[00:53:20.980 --> 00:53:24.180]   at a restaurant, and basically tell
[00:53:24.180 --> 00:53:27.380]   the earpiece, I want to listen to the human being that's sitting
[00:53:27.380 --> 00:53:28.580]   directly in front of me.
[00:53:28.580 --> 00:53:29.580]   I said, great.
[00:53:29.580 --> 00:53:31.380]   OK, we know what a human voice sounds like.
[00:53:31.380 --> 00:53:33.180]   We know what direction this voice is coming from.
[00:53:33.180 --> 00:53:36.780]   We will dumb down every single other piece of noise around
[00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:39.180]   you and just highlight this one specific voice.
[00:53:39.180 --> 00:53:41.180]   It's really, really, really stuff.
[00:53:41.180 --> 00:53:43.780]   And I'm totally with you for a long, long time.
[00:53:43.780 --> 00:53:48.180]   I've been saying that the, for me, the most exciting and
[00:53:48.180 --> 00:53:50.580]   practical use of AR is audio AR.
[00:53:50.580 --> 00:53:53.580]   It's just simply having a little tiny little earpiece in your
[00:53:53.580 --> 00:53:56.580]   ear that is telling you things about the environment as you
[00:53:56.580 --> 00:53:58.980]   pass through it or answering your questions or doing things
[00:53:58.980 --> 00:54:01.180]   for you when you ask questions of it.
[00:54:01.180 --> 00:54:05.180]   I mean, I'm not sure how useful goggles will ever be,
[00:54:05.180 --> 00:54:08.780]   but I know how useful it will be to simply be looking around
[00:54:08.780 --> 00:54:14.180]   and saying, God, where is the closest drugstore?
[00:54:14.180 --> 00:54:16.580]   And because it's talking to the phone in my pocket that knows
[00:54:16.580 --> 00:54:19.780]   GPS because the phone knows where it knows its orientation.
[00:54:19.780 --> 00:54:22.980]   It can say, OK, look for the red brick building.
[00:54:22.980 --> 00:54:25.380]   Look and go towards the yellow building.
[00:54:25.380 --> 00:54:28.100]   And after about a quarter mile, there's a CVS on the right
[00:54:28.100 --> 00:54:28.980]   hand side of the road.
[00:54:28.980 --> 00:54:31.980]   I don't need to have like overlays on my vision to point
[00:54:31.980 --> 00:54:32.580]   that out to me.
[00:54:32.580 --> 00:54:35.580]   I'll just give me, give me G's like, you're just walking
[00:54:35.580 --> 00:54:38.780]   behind me or yodid in my backpack that simply tells me
[00:54:38.780 --> 00:54:39.780]   things that I need to know.
[00:54:39.780 --> 00:54:42.580]   Well, then if you have it also on a, you could have it instead
[00:54:42.580 --> 00:54:46.380]   of saying, hey, whatever, you go, you run into a person at a
[00:54:46.380 --> 00:54:48.180]   party and you go, hi.
[00:54:48.180 --> 00:54:50.780]   And that's what it just, that's Frank.
[00:54:50.780 --> 00:54:52.780]   That's Frank, you met him at the, you know, oh, yeah.
[00:54:52.780 --> 00:54:54.780]   Frank, it hasn't been a long time since we met.
[00:54:54.780 --> 00:54:56.380]   He's got two kids in college.
[00:54:56.380 --> 00:54:59.580]   And you know, that's, but that was the kids.
[00:54:59.580 --> 00:55:03.380]   Judith, Judith and, and, and, and, and, and that's, and that's
[00:55:03.380 --> 00:55:06.500]   only fair because like there are apps on both of our phones
[00:55:06.500 --> 00:55:09.660]   that are already say, oh, Andy Inatko was next to this person
[00:55:09.660 --> 00:55:11.140]   who was, who's really into Pilates.
[00:55:11.140 --> 00:55:13.580]   Maybe I should, if he, he's probably going to talk to Andy
[00:55:13.580 --> 00:55:15.980]   about Pilates, literally Pilates has in the three days.
[00:55:15.980 --> 00:55:18.300]   Why not just say, oh, by the way, here is what we know about
[00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:19.380]   this person.
[00:55:19.380 --> 00:55:20.380]   Yeah.
[00:55:20.380 --> 00:55:22.980]   The last time you, you started on Pilates.
[00:55:22.980 --> 00:55:25.780]   Oh my God, he will talk your ears off.
[00:55:25.780 --> 00:55:27.980]   The last, the last time you left, you left talking to him, you
[00:55:27.980 --> 00:55:29.140]   said never talk to him again.
[00:55:29.140 --> 00:55:32.180]   So you simply laugh and not walk away.
[00:55:32.180 --> 00:55:37.580]   Bloomberg story about Apple, Metasnap and others being bit by
[00:55:37.580 --> 00:55:43.380]   teenage hackers who pretended to be law enforcement and requested
[00:55:43.380 --> 00:55:46.380]   customer information.
[00:55:46.380 --> 00:55:49.380]   According to Bloomberg, Apple and Meta provided details like a
[00:55:49.380 --> 00:55:53.860]   customer's address, phone number and IP address in mid 2021 in
[00:55:53.860 --> 00:55:57.100]   response to the forged emergency data requests.
[00:55:57.100 --> 00:56:00.500]   Normally such requests are accompanied by a search warrant
[00:56:00.500 --> 00:56:04.380]   or a subpoena, but the emergency requests, well, it's an
[00:56:04.380 --> 00:56:04.980]   emergency.
[00:56:04.980 --> 00:56:08.180]   So they don't require a court order.
[00:56:08.180 --> 00:56:10.820]   Snap received a forged legal request from the same hackers.
[00:56:10.820 --> 00:56:14.180]   It's not known whether they provided the data.
[00:56:14.180 --> 00:56:17.380]   Apple referred Bloomberg to its law enforcement guidelines, which
[00:56:17.380 --> 00:56:23.380]   say that somebody who requests such thing may be contacted and
[00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:27.780]   asked to confirm to Apple that the request is legitimate.
[00:56:27.780 --> 00:56:33.100]   Metas said essentially the same thing, but at least in one
[00:56:33.100 --> 00:56:37.340]   case, bad guys did get information about Apple customers by
[00:56:37.340 --> 00:56:44.580]   pretending they were Leo's with an emergency request.
[00:56:44.580 --> 00:56:45.180]   Yeah.
[00:56:45.180 --> 00:56:49.780]   This really does underscore how much we need to have a way of
[00:56:49.780 --> 00:56:53.220]   solidifying and proving identity in all of our transactions
[00:56:53.220 --> 00:56:58.060]   online, because the number of ways in which of the number of
[00:56:58.060 --> 00:57:01.300]   existing technologies and systems that we have to verify the
[00:57:01.300 --> 00:57:04.500]   second two factor of authorization, all these other kind of
[00:57:04.500 --> 00:57:06.860]   technologies, there are ways to get around it.
[00:57:06.860 --> 00:57:12.500]   And it's people who are just on message boards who know how to
[00:57:12.500 --> 00:57:13.100]   do this now.
[00:57:13.100 --> 00:57:16.300]   And it's like you would hope that there's a better way to do
[00:57:16.300 --> 00:57:16.700]   this.
[00:57:16.700 --> 00:57:19.700]   You would hope that there's a given that we're all almost all
[00:57:19.700 --> 00:57:21.860]   of us are carrying a biometric device in our pockets at all
[00:57:21.860 --> 00:57:22.460]   times.
[00:57:22.460 --> 00:57:26.220]   There should be a way to simply say that, OK, one hour ago, Andy
[00:57:26.220 --> 00:57:29.340]   uses his fingerprint to unlock his phone.
[00:57:29.340 --> 00:57:32.700]   He is still within 18 inches of his phone.
[00:57:32.700 --> 00:57:35.900]   That phone has not left his proximity in that hour.
[00:57:35.900 --> 00:57:39.900]   So therefore, I'm going to radio this computer that, by the
[00:57:39.900 --> 00:57:42.540]   way, you can basically trust that this person is who he says he
[00:57:42.540 --> 00:57:44.660]   is.
[00:57:44.660 --> 00:57:48.940]   Bloomberg quotes a research officer at Unit 221(b), which is a
[00:57:48.940 --> 00:57:52.460]   great name for a security firm.
[00:57:52.460 --> 00:57:55.100]   Alison Nixon, who says, "In every instance where these
[00:57:55.100 --> 00:57:58.500]   companies messed up, at the core of it, there was a person
[00:57:58.500 --> 00:58:00.500]   trying to do the right thing.
[00:58:00.500 --> 00:58:02.940]   I can't tell you how many times trust and safety teams have
[00:58:02.940 --> 00:58:06.300]   quietly saved lives because employees had the legal
[00:58:06.300 --> 00:58:10.620]   flexibility to rapidly respond to a tragic situation unfolding
[00:58:10.620 --> 00:58:12.380]   for a user."
[00:58:12.380 --> 00:58:15.380]   That's a good point.
[00:58:15.380 --> 00:58:17.860]   Brian Krebs on Tuesday said hackers have forged an
[00:58:17.860 --> 00:58:21.540]   emergency data request to get information from Discord.
[00:58:21.540 --> 00:58:25.380]   Discord confirmed that it had, in fact, fulfilled such a
[00:58:25.380 --> 00:58:27.860]   request.
[00:58:27.860 --> 00:58:32.060]   But this is going to always be the problem because there are
[00:58:32.060 --> 00:58:36.140]   cases where you really do need this information fast.
[00:58:36.140 --> 00:58:37.380]   Exactly.
[00:58:37.380 --> 00:58:41.140]   That's exactly the part of the system that they exploited,
[00:58:41.140 --> 00:58:44.060]   that there are supposed to be steps and stages and firewalls.
[00:58:44.060 --> 00:58:47.140]   But if there is an active shooter and we need to know about
[00:58:47.140 --> 00:58:51.780]   this person right now, that a different mode gets kicked in.
[00:58:51.780 --> 00:58:56.060]   So hopefully the fact that this particular incident doesn't
[00:58:56.060 --> 00:58:59.420]   seem to have been a huge national security problem, maybe
[00:58:59.420 --> 00:59:01.900]   that will alert Apple and Meta2.
[00:59:01.900 --> 00:59:04.500]   Here we need to strengthen this because obviously this can
[00:59:04.500 --> 00:59:05.540]   be taken advantage of.
[00:59:05.540 --> 00:59:08.220]   You get worried about the things that you never hear about
[00:59:08.220 --> 00:59:11.860]   that no, this never gets reported because the people get
[00:59:11.860 --> 00:59:16.260]   that information and then they just simply two years later it
[00:59:16.260 --> 00:59:19.500]   has the knock on effects of that information getting out there.
[00:59:19.500 --> 00:59:22.500]   Was this what you were talking about, Renee, when you said
[00:59:22.500 --> 00:59:26.620]   that the auto update on iOS is not automatic.
[00:59:26.620 --> 00:59:33.100]   Craig Federighi was asked about this, and he said, this
[00:59:33.100 --> 00:59:34.300]   ended up on Reddit.
[00:59:34.300 --> 00:59:37.300]   Hi, I wrote an email to Craig Federighi, SVP of
[00:59:37.300 --> 00:59:38.980]   Software Engineering in Apple.
[00:59:38.980 --> 00:59:41.780]   How exactly does iOS auto update work?
[00:59:41.780 --> 00:59:47.140]   Craig responded, "We incrementally roll out new iOS
[00:59:47.140 --> 00:59:50.460]   updates by first making them available to those that
[00:59:50.460 --> 00:59:52.180]   explicitly seek them out in settings."
[00:59:52.180 --> 00:59:55.180]   By the way, this is what Microsoft does with Windows.
[00:59:55.180 --> 00:59:58.020]   And they even have a name for those people, Seekers.
[00:59:58.020 --> 00:59:59.860]   So Seekers get it first.
[00:59:59.860 --> 01:00:03.060]   And then one to four weeks later, I didn't realize
[01:00:03.060 --> 01:00:06.100]   it was that long after we've received feedback on the
[01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:08.140]   update ramp up to rolling out the devices with
[01:00:08.140 --> 01:00:09.500]   auto update enabled.
[01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:13.860]   So you may find it as much as a month earlier just by
[01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:16.460]   checking.
[01:00:16.460 --> 01:00:18.420]   I just wanted to give the full details on that because
[01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:18.860]   that's what you're--
[01:00:18.860 --> 01:00:19.940]   Which is really smart.
[01:00:19.940 --> 01:00:21.740]   There's just so many times when we end up with something
[01:00:21.740 --> 01:00:23.740]   that too so would have been good.
[01:00:23.740 --> 01:00:25.620]   You just become-- if you really want it, you're a
[01:00:25.620 --> 01:00:26.260]   gamutester.
[01:00:26.260 --> 01:00:27.260]   They're pretty sure it's OK.
[01:00:27.260 --> 01:00:28.260]   But yeah.
[01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:33.340]   I always thought that was the best mechanism for that way
[01:00:33.340 --> 01:00:35.420]   to work.
[01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:39.100]   Instead of saying this, no, your machine is up to date,
[01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:40.540]   they will basically--
[01:00:40.540 --> 01:00:42.140]   there used to be-- I don't know if it's still active, but
[01:00:42.140 --> 01:00:45.140]   in Android, there used to be a way to put in developer mode
[01:00:45.140 --> 01:00:48.380]   where you have to tap something like just a random piece of
[01:00:48.380 --> 01:00:50.860]   boilerplate that happens to be in settings a certain number
[01:00:50.860 --> 01:00:51.260]   of times.
[01:00:51.260 --> 01:00:54.060]   They figured that, OK, if this person has tapped this eight
[01:00:54.060 --> 01:00:57.780]   times in a row, they have gone to some sort of a forum and
[01:00:57.780 --> 01:00:59.940]   they know that that's how you activate developer mode.
[01:00:59.940 --> 01:01:01.860]   They know what they're doing, so yes, we can activate
[01:01:01.860 --> 01:01:02.580]   developer mode.
[01:01:02.580 --> 01:01:04.620]   Basically, if someone is that interested in getting the
[01:01:04.620 --> 01:01:07.380]   update right now and it is publicly available, why make
[01:01:07.380 --> 01:01:08.180]   this person wait?
[01:01:08.180 --> 01:01:11.540]   If they've demonstrated that they really, really want it,
[01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:13.420]   give it to them.
[01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:18.860]   There's a celebration happening in the Dutch dating apps.
[01:01:18.860 --> 01:01:20.940]   It's here.
[01:01:20.940 --> 01:01:23.780]   They're swiping in the streets, Leo.
[01:01:23.780 --> 01:01:24.380]   Swipe left.
[01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:25.860]   Swipe left.
[01:01:25.860 --> 01:01:27.980]   Knockin' wooden shoes so they'll
[01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:29.740]   stand on and lift on the day.
[01:01:29.740 --> 01:01:31.620]   Knockin' wooden shoes.
[01:01:31.620 --> 01:01:35.540]   The red light district in Amsterdam is, you just hear
[01:01:35.540 --> 01:01:36.220]   the cheers going from--
[01:01:36.220 --> 01:01:38.660]   The cheers, the cheers.
[01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:41.260]   Apple is-- I don't know if this is capitulated, but they
[01:01:41.260 --> 01:01:43.300]   seem to have worked out something with the Dutch
[01:01:43.300 --> 01:01:47.660]   regulators over this whole dating apps thing.
[01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:51.540]   Dutch developers, apparently only Dutch developers, can now
[01:01:51.540 --> 01:01:56.100]   continue using Apple's in-app purchase system or use a
[01:01:56.100 --> 01:02:00.820]   third-party system within the app or include an in-app link
[01:02:00.820 --> 01:02:03.740]   directing users to the developer's website to complete a
[01:02:03.740 --> 01:02:04.740]   purchase.
[01:02:04.740 --> 01:02:07.180]   This is that same 27% rule, though.
[01:02:07.180 --> 01:02:10.540]   You're going to still pay Apple 27%.
[01:02:10.540 --> 01:02:11.500]   So I don't know.
[01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:13.740]   But this is a big deal, I guess.
[01:02:13.740 --> 01:02:16.780]   And maybe it's enough to stop the Dutch regulators from
[01:02:16.780 --> 01:02:17.380]   coming back.
[01:02:17.380 --> 01:02:18.060]   Remember Apple Pay--
[01:02:18.060 --> 01:02:21.260]   If you're a dating app and if you're using
[01:02:21.260 --> 01:02:22.100]   iOS and if--
[01:02:22.100 --> 01:02:25.340]   There's also a new entitlement option for reader apps.
[01:02:25.340 --> 01:02:30.500]   So Kindle Netflix, apps where comixology, I guess, would
[01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:32.060]   qualify where--
[01:02:32.060 --> 01:02:34.780]   It's just an app to read content you've purchased and Apple
[01:02:34.780 --> 01:02:39.900]   has prior to this, either charged them 30% or said, sorry,
[01:02:39.900 --> 01:02:43.060]   you're going to have to sell it somewhere else.
[01:02:43.060 --> 01:02:43.900]   And by the way--
[01:02:43.900 --> 01:02:45.140]   You better hope they used telepathy to find out.
[01:02:45.140 --> 01:02:45.900]   We're going to buy the way.
[01:02:45.900 --> 01:02:47.460]   You can't tell them.
[01:02:47.460 --> 01:02:49.860]   You better not say anything in the app about that.
[01:02:49.860 --> 01:02:53.140]   Starting today, Apple says, with the update of the App Store
[01:02:53.140 --> 01:02:59.100]   review guideline 3.1.3 stroke A.
[01:02:59.100 --> 01:03:01.900]   Developers of reader apps can now request access.
[01:03:01.900 --> 01:03:07.340]   Request access to the external link account entitlement.
[01:03:07.340 --> 01:03:09.980]   This entitlement lets reader apps link to a website that is
[01:03:09.980 --> 01:03:12.900]   owned or maintained by the developer, say Amazon or
[01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:18.260]   Netflix, so that users can create or manage their account
[01:03:18.260 --> 01:03:19.740]   outside the app.
[01:03:19.740 --> 01:03:21.500]   Reader apps are apps that provide one or more of the
[01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:23.940]   following digital content types, magazines, newspapers,
[01:03:23.940 --> 01:03:25.780]   books, audio, music, or video.
[01:03:25.780 --> 01:03:26.740]   Where's comix?
[01:03:26.740 --> 01:03:28.180]   Does comix count?
[01:03:28.180 --> 01:03:29.820]   Or is it primary functionality?
[01:03:29.820 --> 01:03:32.480]   Well, technically, well, technically now,
[01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:34.140]   comixology is Amazon.
[01:03:34.140 --> 01:03:37.260]   It's sold from the Amazon site, so you have to assume that
[01:03:37.260 --> 01:03:38.180]   if it's--
[01:03:38.180 --> 01:03:38.660]   It's a book.
[01:03:38.660 --> 01:03:39.180]   Let's call it a book.
[01:03:39.180 --> 01:03:39.700]   Exactly.
[01:03:39.700 --> 01:03:40.180]   It's considered a book.
[01:03:40.180 --> 01:03:41.140]   Yeah.
[01:03:41.140 --> 01:03:42.900]   Right, so it's a Kindle app.
[01:03:42.900 --> 01:03:45.340]   Some stipulations here are that to be eligible for the
[01:03:45.340 --> 01:03:51.140]   entitlement, developers apps cannot offer in purchases on iOS
[01:03:51.140 --> 01:03:52.140]   or on iOS.
[01:03:52.140 --> 01:03:53.340]   Can't have both.
[01:03:53.340 --> 01:03:56.140]   That's actually a huge problem because a lot of apps--
[01:03:56.140 --> 01:04:00.180]   so like, historically, the problem with this is you have
[01:04:00.180 --> 01:04:02.660]   two aggregators, Apple aggregates apps to resell in the
[01:04:02.660 --> 01:04:05.540]   app store, and some of those apps aggregate content to then
[01:04:05.540 --> 01:04:07.100]   sell through the app store.
[01:04:07.100 --> 01:04:10.820]   And if Apple has a 70/30 deal and those apps have 70/30 deals,
[01:04:10.820 --> 01:04:12.380]   you can't have 70/30/30.
[01:04:12.380 --> 01:04:13.460]   That's just math.
[01:04:13.460 --> 01:04:15.700]   So they've used the IAP system.
[01:04:15.700 --> 01:04:19.740]   But let's say you have 50,000, 100,000, a million IAPs,
[01:04:19.740 --> 01:04:21.940]   you're not going to just turn those off and hope that they
[01:04:21.940 --> 01:04:24.220]   find their way to some web interface.
[01:04:24.220 --> 01:04:27.260]   Like, that's a huge risk, a liability for any company,
[01:04:27.260 --> 01:04:30.020]   which is why making them choose is a big problem.
[01:04:30.020 --> 01:04:31.460]   Yeah.
[01:04:31.460 --> 01:04:37.020]   Also, I mean, the EU's action last week to basically push
[01:04:37.020 --> 01:04:41.300]   for the Digital Markets Act, I don't know how any company
[01:04:41.300 --> 01:04:44.860]   can believe that they're not going to have to open up the
[01:04:44.860 --> 01:04:46.820]   app stores.
[01:04:46.820 --> 01:04:50.620]   And it's still a very, very important conversation to have
[01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:54.660]   about whether opening the app stores is a good idea or not.
[01:04:54.660 --> 01:04:57.380]   But nonetheless, it really does look like this is going to be
[01:04:57.380 --> 01:04:58.700]   a reality in the EU.
[01:04:58.700 --> 01:05:01.340]   And I hope that Apple is working--
[01:05:01.340 --> 01:05:04.220]   I mean, I'm sure they are, but I'm saying that I'm hoping
[01:05:04.220 --> 01:05:06.340]   that they're not just simply saying, we're not--
[01:05:06.340 --> 01:05:08.580]   you can't make us do anything we don't want to do.
[01:05:08.580 --> 01:05:10.060]   Yep, nuke, but OK, well, great.
[01:05:10.060 --> 01:05:11.340]   We're passing along.
[01:05:11.340 --> 01:05:15.700]   If you want to give us 10% of your worldwide income, and then
[01:05:15.700 --> 01:05:19.980]   20% when you tell us to go to hell, we'll take it, go ahead.
[01:05:19.980 --> 01:05:22.260]   It's a reality that they're going to have to prepare for.
[01:05:22.260 --> 01:05:24.540]   And there are other acts similar to that.
[01:05:24.540 --> 01:05:26.900]   They're going through Congress right now, probably not
[01:05:26.900 --> 01:05:28.020]   going to pass this session.
[01:05:28.020 --> 01:05:30.700]   But the EU is the really, really big problem.
[01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:31.200]   Yeah.
[01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:33.540]   I mean, I think that one of the things that you do when you don't
[01:05:33.540 --> 01:05:35.260]   know if you're going to make it or not, you
[01:05:35.260 --> 01:05:37.220]   lobby heavy to take out certain lines.
[01:05:37.220 --> 01:05:39.140]   You want to take out--
[01:05:39.140 --> 01:05:40.340]   like, this is too crazy.
[01:05:40.340 --> 01:05:41.220]   This is too crazy.
[01:05:41.220 --> 01:05:42.420]   This is too crazy.
[01:05:42.420 --> 01:05:45.540]   And oftentimes, with enough lobbying, you get some of those
[01:05:45.540 --> 01:05:46.040]   taken out.
[01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:48.700]   And usually, those are what we call loopholes.
[01:05:48.700 --> 01:05:54.060]   And so there's a lot of ways that Apple can continue to do
[01:05:54.060 --> 01:05:56.100]   most of the stuff that's there.
[01:05:56.100 --> 01:05:58.700]   I mean, a lot of it has to do with how--
[01:05:58.700 --> 01:06:00.700]   so there's a lot of ways to kind of cut this.
[01:06:00.700 --> 01:06:02.580]   I haven't been able to read through all--
[01:06:02.580 --> 01:06:04.660]   I've read the highlights, but I haven't read through the
[01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:05.220]   actual--
[01:06:05.220 --> 01:06:07.260]   I don't know if it's published yet.
[01:06:07.260 --> 01:06:09.980]   But the actual-- all the text, I've read through the US one.
[01:06:09.980 --> 01:06:10.580]   It's a mess.
[01:06:10.580 --> 01:06:13.060]   I mean, it's just written by children.
[01:06:13.060 --> 01:06:19.060]   But the EU one I haven't found the text of it.
[01:06:19.060 --> 01:06:24.260]   But the issue really is, is the delineation between
[01:06:24.260 --> 01:06:26.500]   developers-- this is going to be what's important.
[01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:30.340]   The delineation between developers that use the Apple
[01:06:30.340 --> 01:06:33.300]   platform versus the developers who don't.
[01:06:33.300 --> 01:06:37.060]   And if Apple's able to distinguish between the two,
[01:06:37.060 --> 01:06:39.660]   being outside of the system will be worthless.
[01:06:39.660 --> 01:06:42.740]   Because Apple will just have a developer plus that you pay
[01:06:42.740 --> 01:06:43.500]   a little bit more.
[01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:45.380]   And oh, by the way, you pay $100 or more.
[01:06:45.380 --> 01:06:48.820]   And you promise that all your apps will stay inside of that.
[01:06:48.820 --> 01:06:51.300]   And then because if you don't do that, you can--
[01:06:51.300 --> 01:06:52.580]   do you think you'll ever show up?
[01:06:52.580 --> 01:06:56.140]   And this is still-- this is the soft power that Apple has.
[01:06:56.140 --> 01:07:00.540]   Is that it's a complete mystery on what shows up as
[01:07:00.540 --> 01:07:01.820]   recommendations.
[01:07:01.820 --> 01:07:05.300]   My guess is that if you start charging outside the system,
[01:07:05.300 --> 01:07:08.300]   they'll show a couple to not look like they're doing it
[01:07:08.300 --> 01:07:08.780]   completely.
[01:07:08.780 --> 01:07:11.580]   But it's a pretty uphill battle at that point.
[01:07:11.580 --> 01:07:13.820]   Well, that would be a very dangerous move.
[01:07:13.820 --> 01:07:16.780]   Because the language of the Digital Markets Act is--
[01:07:16.780 --> 01:07:19.660]   it is designed to avoid having to go for these one-shot,
[01:07:19.660 --> 01:07:21.380]   one-shot, one-shot lawsuits.
[01:07:21.380 --> 01:07:25.020]   It is designed to simply say, no, you cannot use your
[01:07:25.020 --> 01:07:28.300]   market position in order to promote your own products
[01:07:28.300 --> 01:07:29.220]   over anybody else's.
[01:07:29.220 --> 01:07:33.660]   And so it would take a couple of years for them to get to
[01:07:33.660 --> 01:07:35.540]   the point where they're saying, yes, you're basically
[01:07:35.540 --> 01:07:37.940]   telling people-- you're basically telling developers
[01:07:37.940 --> 01:07:39.860]   that, well, if you want to be able to use lower case
[01:07:39.860 --> 01:07:42.660]   characters in your apps, you're going to have to sell
[01:07:42.660 --> 01:07:44.060]   through our app store.
[01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:45.340]   They're going to get hit pretty hard.
[01:07:45.340 --> 01:07:50.260]   And the other difficulty is that I really think that the
[01:07:50.260 --> 01:07:51.020]   EU is going to pass this.
[01:07:51.020 --> 01:07:54.860]   I don't think that US companies are going to be able to make
[01:07:54.860 --> 01:07:56.980]   nearly the kind of changes that they would like to make.
[01:07:56.980 --> 01:08:01.060]   Because you remember that they can very effectively lobby
[01:08:01.060 --> 01:08:01.620]   the United States.
[01:08:01.620 --> 01:08:05.060]   Because it's the United States company that's--
[01:08:05.060 --> 01:08:07.060]   the United States companies are contributing to the
[01:08:07.060 --> 01:08:08.540]   United States economy.
[01:08:08.540 --> 01:08:11.100]   EU, they're saying, well, look, it doesn't matter to us.
[01:08:11.100 --> 01:08:14.740]   You guys are trying to stiff us for taxes anyway.
[01:08:14.740 --> 01:08:19.700]   It doesn't really make one hill of beans to us whether you
[01:08:19.700 --> 01:08:21.140]   suffer from this or you don't.
[01:08:21.140 --> 01:08:22.820]   You are not an EU-based company.
[01:08:22.820 --> 01:08:25.060]   So why should we try to protect you?
[01:08:25.060 --> 01:08:28.180]   And the folks making the rules in the EU are also not very
[01:08:28.180 --> 01:08:30.460]   accountable to the people and not very responsive.
[01:08:30.460 --> 01:08:33.380]   So in the United States, if they really screw this up and
[01:08:33.380 --> 01:08:35.860]   then Apple drills a hole into that, they'll lose their
[01:08:35.860 --> 01:08:36.700]   position.
[01:08:36.700 --> 01:08:38.860]   They'll actually lose their election.
[01:08:38.860 --> 01:08:42.980]   Because Apple's not just campaigning right now for it
[01:08:42.980 --> 01:08:44.140]   not to happen.
[01:08:44.140 --> 01:08:47.060]   They're campaigning to lay the groundwork to undermine
[01:08:47.060 --> 01:08:49.140]   anybody that had it later.
[01:08:49.140 --> 01:08:52.340]   Because they're building a whole thing of I told you so.
[01:08:52.340 --> 01:08:53.980]   I know I am.
[01:08:53.980 --> 01:08:57.220]   So the thing is, is it's going to be a whole lot of I told
[01:08:57.220 --> 01:08:59.540]   you so when it turns out ugly and people start being
[01:08:59.540 --> 01:09:02.140]   frustrated by their apps.
[01:09:02.140 --> 01:09:04.460]   And I think that like the CNN app just came out in the CNN
[01:09:04.460 --> 01:09:06.060]   plus plus app or whatever.
[01:09:06.060 --> 01:09:08.220]   And of course I have to subscribe to it externally.
[01:09:08.220 --> 01:09:09.740]   And I was like, one star.
[01:09:09.740 --> 01:09:11.980]   I'm like, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not only am I not
[01:09:11.980 --> 01:09:14.340]   going to subscribe, I'm going to give you a one star screw
[01:09:14.340 --> 01:09:17.420]   that, you know, and now, and then CNN, and this is, this
[01:09:17.420 --> 01:09:18.300]   has watched this happen.
[01:09:18.300 --> 01:09:20.780]   CNN now is pushing all their videos to, you know, when
[01:09:20.780 --> 01:09:22.820]   you go to the website, it's all like, oh, you want to
[01:09:22.820 --> 01:09:23.340]   watch a video?
[01:09:23.340 --> 01:09:25.220]   Oh, you have to be part of CNN plus, you know, so
[01:09:25.220 --> 01:09:27.740]   everything that used to be free is now you have to go
[01:09:27.740 --> 01:09:31.900]   into here and in, and you just welcome to it's siloed.
[01:09:31.900 --> 01:09:35.220]   And then it's also, again, you have to, you have to sign up
[01:09:35.220 --> 01:09:37.740]   for that to their little subscription thing outside
[01:09:37.740 --> 01:09:38.180]   of the app store.
[01:09:38.180 --> 01:09:40.780]   Like, cause I'm, and I'm slowly turning in the Apple TV.
[01:09:40.780 --> 01:09:43.300]   I'm slowly anything with an external including Netflix.
[01:09:43.300 --> 01:09:44.940]   I'm just turning off like I don't want to do it.
[01:09:44.940 --> 01:09:45.740]   Can we talk about this before?
[01:09:45.740 --> 01:09:47.660]   Can you imagine if music was like this and we had to
[01:09:47.660 --> 01:09:51.100]   subscribe to AMC separately from Sony separately from
[01:09:51.100 --> 01:09:53.780]   Warner's and you too is big enough and Taylor Swift is big
[01:09:53.780 --> 01:09:55.580]   enough, they have their own services.
[01:09:55.580 --> 01:09:57.220]   But not like we get all the music.
[01:09:57.220 --> 01:09:59.020]   Like basically you can pick your service and you still
[01:09:59.020 --> 01:10:01.140]   have almost the entire same catalog.
[01:10:01.140 --> 01:10:04.780]   But video is becoming increasingly fragmented and like
[01:10:04.780 --> 01:10:07.780]   it's worse internationally because like Paramount Plus
[01:10:07.780 --> 01:10:10.300]   in the US is a thing, but they, they want more money.
[01:10:10.300 --> 01:10:12.460]   So they sell just Star Trek to Bell.
[01:10:12.460 --> 01:10:14.660]   So then you get Paramount Plus here without Star Trek.
[01:10:14.660 --> 01:10:16.020]   You have to pay for something else just to get the
[01:10:16.020 --> 01:10:18.940]   Star Trek stuff back and it's become unmanageable.
[01:10:18.940 --> 01:10:21.540]   Like there's 18, 23 services now.
[01:10:21.540 --> 01:10:24.900]   Well, and like for me, I just bought, I just got my, my,
[01:10:24.900 --> 01:10:26.660]   my studio over the weekend.
[01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:27.340]   Yay.
[01:10:27.340 --> 01:10:27.860]   And.
[01:10:27.860 --> 01:10:29.020]   Yay.
[01:10:29.020 --> 01:10:31.380]   One press of a button or, you know, in one minute I
[01:10:31.380 --> 01:10:33.860]   started downloading all of the stuff that's in my app store.
[01:10:33.860 --> 01:10:36.700]   And now I have to, now I have to slowly try to figure out
[01:10:36.700 --> 01:10:39.940]   what the registration is for all the other apps that I have
[01:10:39.940 --> 01:10:40.940]   to do a serial number for.
[01:10:40.940 --> 01:10:43.020]   And I'm just not going to, and here's the thing is that
[01:10:43.020 --> 01:10:45.620]   there's like eight of them that I'm going to put on here.
[01:10:45.620 --> 01:10:48.900]   And then I'm going to not buy the upgrades for the other ones.
[01:10:48.900 --> 01:10:50.820]   Like I'm just like, I'm just, like I'm just, you know,
[01:10:50.820 --> 01:10:52.900]   and you have like three Mac like that's like, I have like
[01:10:52.900 --> 01:10:55.100]   motion VFX, you get two licenses.
[01:10:55.100 --> 01:10:57.980]   I have three Macs or you get to like from Adobe, the
[01:10:57.980 --> 01:10:59.940]   app store, it's like eight computer.
[01:10:59.940 --> 01:11:02.340]   I'm never going to have eight Macs in this house.
[01:11:02.340 --> 01:11:04.100]   Well, and for me, it's not even the number of Macs.
[01:11:04.100 --> 01:11:05.860]   It's just that I'm just not willing to go through the
[01:11:05.860 --> 01:11:06.740]   serial number process.
[01:11:06.740 --> 01:11:08.900]   And I realized that that, you know, I just don't want to do
[01:11:08.900 --> 01:11:09.380]   it anymore.
[01:11:09.380 --> 01:11:12.660]   So I'm, you know, just if it's not connected to my Apple thing,
[01:11:12.660 --> 01:11:14.900]   I'm just not going to buy it unless it's, unless it's like
[01:11:14.900 --> 01:11:17.700]   really big, but anything under $100, forget it.
[01:11:17.700 --> 01:11:18.220]   Yeah.
[01:11:18.220 --> 01:11:22.380]   I do think that Renee, you've, you've got what you, you've
[01:11:22.380 --> 01:11:25.260]   kind of hit upon what Apple and Google and all these other
[01:11:25.260 --> 01:11:26.340]   companies going to have to do.
[01:11:26.340 --> 01:11:28.700]   I do think they're going to have to fragment the app store.
[01:11:28.700 --> 01:11:31.420]   They're not going to want to accommodate the EU rules.
[01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:33.260]   They're going to, excuse me, worldwide.
[01:11:33.260 --> 01:11:36.300]   So they're going to basically create, here is the EU
[01:11:36.300 --> 01:11:37.500]   version of the iPhone.
[01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:39.620]   Here is the US version of the iPhone.
[01:11:39.620 --> 01:11:43.620]   They're, they will have just, just like in Russia, they do
[01:11:43.620 --> 01:11:46.540]   things to the installer that they do, they don't do in any
[01:11:46.540 --> 01:11:48.860]   other version of the iPhone anywhere.
[01:11:48.860 --> 01:11:52.220]   And I can't imagine how, if that happens, I can't imagine
[01:11:52.220 --> 01:11:55.500]   how difficult it's going to be for developers to deal with
[01:11:55.500 --> 01:11:58.660]   what might be like a brand new set of APIs, a brand new
[01:11:58.660 --> 01:12:02.780]   Xcode framework about here is what you can, here is how you
[01:12:02.780 --> 01:12:07.580]   can basically ask, ask what is happening and this version of
[01:12:07.580 --> 01:12:10.580]   the, of the store, which of your entitlements that you have
[01:12:10.580 --> 01:12:13.660]   been granted will apply here and which will not work here, or
[01:12:13.660 --> 01:12:16.380]   whether you're just going to have to submit it to separate,
[01:12:16.380 --> 01:12:19.500]   separate bureaucracies for each different app store in the
[01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:21.700]   world in which you want to sell your app.
[01:12:21.700 --> 01:12:23.380]   And tax authorities.
[01:12:23.380 --> 01:12:24.900]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:12:24.900 --> 01:12:25.980]   Let's take a little break.
[01:12:25.980 --> 01:12:27.100]   More to come.
[01:12:27.100 --> 01:12:28.500]   Renee Richie.
[01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:32.340]   Two years on YouTube.
[01:12:32.340 --> 01:12:34.420]   Any regrets?
[01:12:34.420 --> 01:12:36.140]   No, not a one.
[01:12:36.140 --> 01:12:37.060]   It's fantastic.
[01:12:37.060 --> 01:12:37.980]   Yeah.
[01:12:37.980 --> 01:12:38.620]   It's going very well.
[01:12:38.620 --> 01:12:39.780]   Are you doing this for a while, Leo?
[01:12:39.780 --> 01:12:42.740]   Like you're like, you're like a trailblazer for all for
[01:12:42.740 --> 01:12:42.980]   indie.
[01:12:42.980 --> 01:12:44.820]   You know, it's amazing.
[01:12:44.820 --> 01:12:48.100]   April 11th, I think is their 17th anniversary of the first
[01:12:48.100 --> 01:12:48.380]   twin.
[01:12:48.380 --> 01:12:49.300]   Amazing.
[01:12:49.300 --> 01:12:51.100]   So 17 years.
[01:12:51.100 --> 01:12:53.500]   Yeah, but I don't know if that's not what you're doing
[01:12:53.500 --> 01:12:54.500]   really.
[01:12:54.500 --> 01:12:56.500]   I mean, we're just podcasters.
[01:12:56.500 --> 01:12:59.140]   But yeah, but we don't have to work for the man, Leo.
[01:12:59.140 --> 01:13:00.980]   We don't have like eight layers of editors above us.
[01:13:00.980 --> 01:13:02.340]   Oh, I work for the woman.
[01:13:02.340 --> 01:13:03.340]   That's the problem.
[01:13:03.340 --> 01:13:05.540]   I've replaced the man with a--
[01:13:05.540 --> 01:13:06.700]   That's a very--
[01:13:06.700 --> 01:13:10.060]   A very smart woman who knows how to steer the ship very, very
[01:13:10.060 --> 01:13:10.260]   well.
[01:13:10.260 --> 01:13:11.380]   Who saves you from yourself.
[01:13:11.380 --> 01:13:14.340]   I'm very glad to be working for the woman.
[01:13:14.340 --> 01:13:17.140]   Alex Lindsey, Office Hours.Global.
[01:13:17.140 --> 01:13:18.860]   What'd you do this week on Office Hours?
[01:13:18.860 --> 01:13:20.620]   You always get something good going.
[01:13:20.620 --> 01:13:21.620]   We were talking about--
[01:13:21.620 --> 01:13:23.340]   First, we were talking about-- our Mondays are kind of
[01:13:23.340 --> 01:13:27.460]   business, so we were talking about just branding and
[01:13:27.460 --> 01:13:27.980]   marketing.
[01:13:27.980 --> 01:13:30.460]   And then today, we were talking about green screen.
[01:13:30.460 --> 01:13:32.220]   Carlita!
[01:13:32.220 --> 01:13:33.700]   Yeah, so you saw Carlita come.
[01:13:33.700 --> 01:13:35.420]   My wife was on there.
[01:13:35.420 --> 01:13:37.260]   That's a test plate that we had.
[01:13:37.260 --> 01:13:39.340]   So we really broke down how to shoot green screen and
[01:13:39.340 --> 01:13:40.300]   answer questions.
[01:13:40.300 --> 01:13:42.340]   We'd done it last week, but there were so many questions
[01:13:42.340 --> 01:13:44.340]   that we did it again this week.
[01:13:44.340 --> 01:13:49.660]   And then tomorrow, we've got this stage that we built in
[01:13:49.660 --> 01:13:52.460]   our back in our office.
[01:13:52.460 --> 01:13:53.620]   But that's 56 wide and--
[01:13:53.620 --> 01:13:54.660]   At your house?
[01:13:54.660 --> 01:13:55.340]   Deep.
[01:13:55.340 --> 01:13:57.020]   No, at the office, at the office.
[01:13:57.020 --> 01:13:59.420]   We're using the old ILM main stage.
[01:13:59.420 --> 01:14:02.980]   And so we filled it with a bunch of lights and cameras
[01:14:02.980 --> 01:14:03.580]   and stuff like that.
[01:14:03.580 --> 01:14:07.300]   And so we have this incredible lighting designer, Tlallak.
[01:14:07.300 --> 01:14:10.660]   And he is going to show people how he's running all the
[01:14:10.660 --> 01:14:13.060]   lights from his house in Delaware.
[01:14:13.060 --> 01:14:14.700]   So he's in Delaware, and he's running-- he's all these
[01:14:14.700 --> 01:14:17.460]   mover lights, and they're all moving and animated and
[01:14:17.460 --> 01:14:18.020]   everything else.
[01:14:18.020 --> 01:14:19.820]   And he's running them all until he's going to show people.
[01:14:19.820 --> 01:14:23.340]   And we're literally going to have a shot from the stage.
[01:14:23.340 --> 01:14:25.700]   So while he's showing them the software, the lights
[01:14:25.700 --> 01:14:26.740]   are moving very nice.
[01:14:26.740 --> 01:14:27.780]   So it's a lot of fun.
[01:14:27.780 --> 01:14:29.660]   Office Hours.Global.
[01:14:29.660 --> 01:14:32.980]   It's now 24/7.
[01:14:32.980 --> 01:14:38.340]   And Andy Inaco, who is not any newspaper.
[01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:41.460]   Although, man, Chicago newspaper business is getting
[01:14:41.460 --> 01:14:44.140]   weirder and weirder.
[01:14:44.140 --> 01:14:50.580]   It's always been a very, very bare knuckled, greasy,
[01:14:50.580 --> 01:14:51.580]   handed business.
[01:14:51.580 --> 01:14:53.540]   God, we love it so.
[01:14:53.540 --> 01:14:56.940]   I think Chicago Public Radio just bought--
[01:14:56.940 --> 01:14:57.580]   be easy.
[01:14:57.580 --> 01:14:59.980]   Just bought the Sun times.
[01:14:59.980 --> 01:15:02.300]   That's so weird.
[01:15:02.300 --> 01:15:07.140]   I have-- I don't Google my former lovers.
[01:15:07.140 --> 01:15:07.660]   I wouldn't know.
[01:15:07.660 --> 01:15:09.860]   Oh, well, you probably don't want to know then what's going
[01:15:09.860 --> 01:15:10.660]   on over there.
[01:15:10.660 --> 01:15:11.900]   I hope you all--
[01:15:11.900 --> 01:15:12.740]   I hope you all--
[01:15:12.740 --> 01:15:14.020]   we had a great time together.
[01:15:14.020 --> 01:15:15.900]   I hope that wherever they are and whoever they're with,
[01:15:15.900 --> 01:15:18.300]   they're very, very happy.
[01:15:18.300 --> 01:15:19.900]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:15:19.900 --> 01:15:23.740]   Public radio and newspapers together.
[01:15:23.740 --> 01:15:24.180]   Oh, yeah.
[01:15:24.180 --> 01:15:28.220]   I tried to do that 30 years ago with a newspaper.
[01:15:28.220 --> 01:15:31.940]   Like, the idea that you could tie the two of them together
[01:15:31.940 --> 01:15:32.940]   makes total sense.
[01:15:32.940 --> 01:15:35.420]   And you'll be able to have promotions and information
[01:15:35.420 --> 01:15:38.820]   and integrate them between the two totally is--
[01:15:38.820 --> 01:15:41.100]   It's really become public service, too,
[01:15:41.100 --> 01:15:44.700]   because they actually had to get donations, $61 million
[01:15:44.700 --> 01:15:46.860]   in donations to complete the sale.
[01:15:46.860 --> 01:15:49.260]   And it's all from philanthropy.
[01:15:49.260 --> 01:15:52.220]   So it's a really interesting idea.
[01:15:52.220 --> 01:15:55.540]   To be honest, the Sun times has been the victim of so
[01:15:55.540 --> 01:15:57.780]   many terrible owners with--
[01:15:57.780 --> 01:15:59.900]   and such terrible finances.
[01:15:59.900 --> 01:16:05.580]   Just robbers and sheets and short-fingered Toldarians.
[01:16:05.580 --> 01:16:06.580]   That's the thing.
[01:16:06.580 --> 01:16:07.580]   Toldarians.
[01:16:07.580 --> 01:16:09.140]   And I mean, I don't--
[01:16:09.140 --> 01:16:11.140]   I don't understand why you're trying to--
[01:16:11.140 --> 01:16:12.140]   Yeah.
[01:16:12.140 --> 01:16:14.060]   And honestly, that was one of the reasons
[01:16:14.060 --> 01:16:17.340]   why there were some problems that we couldn't resolve
[01:16:17.340 --> 01:16:20.100]   and I decided to go.
[01:16:20.100 --> 01:16:23.300]   But it's such a beautiful, trans tradition.
[01:16:23.300 --> 01:16:25.420]   There's just something about a newspaper that
[01:16:25.420 --> 01:16:28.780]   has 100 years behind it, that has a reputation,
[01:16:28.780 --> 01:16:31.740]   that has a position inside a city,
[01:16:31.740 --> 01:16:34.020]   a city that-- one of the few remaining cities--
[01:16:34.020 --> 01:16:36.900]   is a two newspaper city, where there are people who read the Sun
[01:16:36.900 --> 01:16:38.540]   times, there are people who read the trip.
[01:16:38.540 --> 01:16:39.980]   -Tronk. -And--
[01:16:39.980 --> 01:16:40.300]   Yeah.
[01:16:40.300 --> 01:16:42.460]   And there's two really different paths, right?
[01:16:42.460 --> 01:16:47.500]   So Tronk is very much about financial ownership.
[01:16:47.500 --> 01:16:50.140]   And I love seeing the Sun times go the public route.
[01:16:50.140 --> 01:16:53.580]   And I think this is going to be an interesting comparison.
[01:16:53.580 --> 01:16:55.780]   I hope-- this should happen to more newspapers.
[01:16:55.780 --> 01:16:58.100]   This is a very-- I think a very interesting idea.
[01:16:58.100 --> 01:17:00.620]   Anyway, sorry to bring up the old girlfriend.
[01:17:00.620 --> 01:17:02.180]   You always might understand.
[01:17:02.180 --> 01:17:03.420]   I apologize.
[01:17:03.420 --> 01:17:04.460]   These new lovers--
[01:17:04.460 --> 01:17:05.500]   But they have the--
[01:17:05.500 --> 01:17:07.820]   The new relationship to bhnews.org.
[01:17:07.820 --> 01:17:08.380]   Very good.
[01:17:08.380 --> 01:17:09.300]   Very, very good.
[01:17:09.300 --> 01:17:09.620]   Yes.
[01:17:09.620 --> 01:17:10.780]   Boston's NPR station.
[01:17:10.780 --> 01:17:11.780]   Yes.
[01:17:11.780 --> 01:17:15.420]   Are sure today brought to you by Zip Recruiter?
[01:17:15.420 --> 01:17:17.460]   Look at all the jobs that were created last month.
[01:17:17.460 --> 01:17:20.260]   People are coming back to work.
[01:17:20.260 --> 01:17:24.220]   And one of the reasons is, according to research,
[01:17:24.220 --> 01:17:28.100]   90% of employers want to make the employee experience
[01:17:28.100 --> 01:17:30.980]   their top priority this year.
[01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:33.980]   A happy workplace is absolutely key to attracting
[01:17:33.980 --> 01:17:35.940]   and keeping great employees.
[01:17:35.940 --> 01:17:38.700]   Zip Recruiter reminds you that you can make your employees
[01:17:38.700 --> 01:17:41.220]   happier by making them feel more valued,
[01:17:41.220 --> 01:17:43.660]   including them in the decision making process,
[01:17:43.660 --> 01:17:47.060]   focusing on company culture, offering more learning
[01:17:47.060 --> 01:17:49.260]   opportunities, allowing for more flexibility and work
[01:17:49.260 --> 01:17:52.540]   schedules, showing more empathy, making more time to connect.
[01:17:52.540 --> 01:17:55.580]   And we've done some of this thanks to the woman,
[01:17:55.580 --> 01:17:57.140]   a four-day work week, which I think
[01:17:57.140 --> 01:17:59.060]   is a really great improvement.
[01:17:59.060 --> 01:18:01.180]   I think it's really great.
[01:18:01.180 --> 01:18:04.180]   Anyway, Zip Recruiter is also saying--
[01:18:04.180 --> 01:18:05.100]   thanks for reminding me--
[01:18:05.100 --> 01:18:08.740]   if you need to add more employees to your team,
[01:18:08.740 --> 01:18:12.900]   you could try Zip Recruiter free at zipprecruiter.com/macbreak.
[01:18:12.900 --> 01:18:15.820]   And I say this because we use Zip Recruiter,

[01:18:19.380 --> 01:18:22.980]   It's easy to post to reach the largest possible audience,
[01:18:22.980 --> 01:18:26.580]   but then Zip Recruiter does something pretty amazing.
[01:18:26.580 --> 01:18:30.020]   Zip Recruiter's technology finds the right candidates

[01:18:46.780 --> 01:18:49.420]   No wonder Zip Recruiter is the number one rated hiring site
[01:18:49.420 --> 01:18:51.700]   in the US based on G2 ratings.
[01:18:51.700 --> 01:18:53.260]   We're big fans.

[01:19:16.740 --> 01:19:19.820]   for us at Twit in hiring,

[01:19:22.500 --> 01:19:23.940]   Don't forget, as a listener and a viewer

[01:19:26.980 --> 01:19:31.980]   Zip Recruiter.com/macbreak, the best way to hire.
[01:19:31.980 --> 01:19:37.060]   Apple has started lobbying in a variety of states,
[01:19:37.060 --> 01:19:38.980]   Iowa, Texas, and Florida,
[01:19:38.980 --> 01:19:43.660]   against Bill's targeting gay and transgender folks.
[01:19:43.660 --> 01:19:48.540]   Of course, Tim Cook is probably the country's most
[01:19:48.540 --> 01:19:51.140]   visible gay CEO.
[01:19:51.140 --> 01:19:53.900]   He has deployed lobbyists to oppose legislation
[01:19:53.900 --> 01:19:56.260]   that limits protections for trans and gay people
[01:19:56.260 --> 01:19:58.500]   to their families in Iowa, Florida, Texas,
[01:19:58.500 --> 01:20:00.980]   six states in total.
[01:20:00.980 --> 01:20:07.460]   This has also brought down some negative comments.
[01:20:07.460 --> 01:20:09.060]   Yeah, the anti-cancel culture people are trying
[01:20:09.060 --> 01:20:10.700]   to cancel them, it's amazing.
[01:20:10.700 --> 01:20:12.020]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:20:12.020 --> 01:20:15.580]   Ken Buck, who's a representative from, I think, Colorado.
[01:20:15.580 --> 01:20:16.420]   Colorado, yeah.
[01:20:16.420 --> 01:20:18.120]   He took it down, he tweeted,
[01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:24.100]   and of course, nothing ever goes away on the internet.
[01:20:24.100 --> 01:20:29.100]   He tweeted that he wanted to use anti-trust legislation
[01:20:29.100 --> 01:20:35.740]   against Apple to, quote, smash woke capital.
[01:20:35.740 --> 01:20:40.940]   You know, interesting.
[01:20:40.940 --> 01:20:42.900]   The thing is, like their tweets are like night and day,
[01:20:42.900 --> 01:20:44.900]   every second tweet says something completely opposite
[01:20:44.900 --> 01:20:46.620]   from the tweet before it, and it's dizzying.
[01:20:46.620 --> 01:20:49.780]   It's just dizzying, it's performative, it's performative,
[01:20:49.780 --> 01:20:53.420]   it's popularly playing to the base.
[01:20:53.420 --> 01:20:58.420]   So although, as Techter points out,
[01:20:58.420 --> 01:21:01.980]   there are plenty of monopolies Ken Buck likes,
[01:21:01.980 --> 01:21:04.900]   including the telecom monopoly, which is probably--
[01:21:04.900 --> 01:21:05.740]   Probably gas, too.
[01:21:05.740 --> 01:21:08.740]   Yeah, and gas, and yeah, and on and on and on.
[01:21:08.740 --> 01:21:11.620]   But if you're woke, oh boy.
[01:21:11.620 --> 01:21:12.900]   You know, that's no one ever even talks
[01:21:12.900 --> 01:21:15.100]   about regulating telecom, they pay so much money,
[01:21:15.100 --> 01:21:16.660]   they get it completely free.
[01:21:16.660 --> 01:21:18.540]   Completely, but you know why?
[01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:21.860]   They pay so much money to the legislators.
[01:21:22.700 --> 01:21:26.340]   The tweet said, "Andy trusts is the best way
[01:21:26.340 --> 01:21:29.140]   "to smash woke capital and protect our kids.
[01:21:29.140 --> 01:21:32.020]   "Companies that grow to colossal size, monopoly size,
[01:21:32.020 --> 01:21:35.020]   "use their power to change politics
[01:21:35.020 --> 01:21:37.060]   "and make more profit.
[01:21:37.060 --> 01:21:38.620]   "This power is a function of their wealth
[01:21:38.620 --> 01:21:40.180]   "and control over the economy.
[01:21:40.180 --> 01:21:42.500]   "At some point they start to control the information flow
[01:21:42.500 --> 01:21:43.700]   "on our democracy.
[01:21:43.700 --> 01:21:48.180]   "We end up like AT&T and Verizon and Comcast.
[01:21:48.180 --> 01:21:50.060]   "We end up being governed by the CEOs
[01:21:50.060 --> 01:21:53.060]   "and monopolies in their hard left employee base."
[01:21:53.060 --> 01:21:54.620]   National for police.
[01:21:54.620 --> 01:21:59.260]   Well thank God those barefoot hippies,
[01:21:59.260 --> 01:22:02.340]   the Koch brothers, are not abusing their money
[01:22:02.340 --> 01:22:04.140]   and their power, the energy industry,
[01:22:04.140 --> 01:22:06.620]   to try to affect political discourse in this country.
[01:22:06.620 --> 01:22:09.620]   I guess I shouldn't be surprised by this ever, right?
[01:22:09.620 --> 01:22:10.780]   It's just more of this.
[01:22:10.780 --> 01:22:15.780]   Well also because he's interesting in that he's one
[01:22:15.780 --> 01:22:18.900]   of the few Republicans who's actually,
[01:22:18.900 --> 01:22:23.900]   hasn't exactly spoken against weakening section 230,
[01:22:23.900 --> 01:22:25.820]   the Communications Agency Act,
[01:22:25.820 --> 01:22:28.700]   which is the usual like rah rah moment
[01:22:28.700 --> 01:22:30.980]   for Republican camera hogs.
[01:22:30.980 --> 01:22:33.140]   He really is all about antitrust.
[01:22:33.140 --> 01:22:36.380]   He really, really is all about new regulations,
[01:22:36.380 --> 01:22:40.300]   prevent mergers, to reduce the power of large companies.
[01:22:40.300 --> 01:22:44.460]   So this is, he is very, very much a member of the GOP,
[01:22:44.460 --> 01:22:48.820]   but he seems to see the world in terms of antitrust
[01:22:48.820 --> 01:22:53.340]   and antitrust, our weapon against big company, exactly.
[01:22:53.340 --> 01:22:56.260]   And they're using it towards this issue.
[01:22:56.260 --> 01:22:58.340]   And thank goodness for Apple,
[01:22:58.340 --> 01:23:00.100]   they're absolutely doing the right thing.
[01:23:00.100 --> 01:23:03.260]   They're, we saw with Disney how, you know what,
[01:23:03.260 --> 01:23:06.540]   if you don't stand, when you have a law
[01:23:06.540 --> 01:23:10.020]   that is going to be deeply offensive,
[01:23:10.020 --> 01:23:13.460]   anger inducing, rage inducingly offensive,
[01:23:13.460 --> 01:23:15.660]   to a large percentage of your workforce
[01:23:15.660 --> 01:23:19.740]   that are going to be directly affected by idiotic laws,
[01:23:19.740 --> 01:23:22.300]   as a CEO, you can't just simply wash your hands of it.
[01:23:22.300 --> 01:23:24.900]   You have to basically keep your people happy
[01:23:24.900 --> 01:23:27.500]   because they're, they're all over this country
[01:23:27.500 --> 01:23:28.420]   and all over this world.
[01:23:28.420 --> 01:23:30.940]   And Apple, Apple is not one of the,
[01:23:30.940 --> 01:23:35.180]   Apple is a company that does lots of lobbying on its own.
[01:23:35.180 --> 01:23:38.540]   They don't do a whole lot of like justice lobbying
[01:23:38.540 --> 01:23:42.300]   as far as I know, as far as I've been reading,
[01:23:42.300 --> 01:23:44.700]   but they pick their battle very, very correctly
[01:23:44.700 --> 01:23:49.700]   because again, if this is, this is almost a gosh,
[01:23:49.700 --> 01:23:51.860]   this is this, I believe this is an issue
[01:23:51.860 --> 01:23:54.940]   where you are on one side of this or the other side of this.
[01:23:54.940 --> 01:23:57.780]   And if you profess to not have an opinion,
[01:23:57.780 --> 01:23:58.940]   we know your answer.
[01:23:58.940 --> 01:24:03.940]   And so a CEO of Tim Cook-Statcher has to weigh in on this.
[01:24:03.940 --> 01:24:06.860]   It has to bring the full, might of this fully operational
[01:24:06.860 --> 01:24:10.980]   battle station against this terrible law.
[01:24:10.980 --> 01:24:13.220]   - It's pretty gentle lobbying as an example,
[01:24:13.220 --> 01:24:15.860]   Apple's senior director of corporate communications,
[01:24:15.860 --> 01:24:19.780]   Fred Saints, sent a letter to leaders
[01:24:19.780 --> 01:24:22.780]   of fellow Fortune 500 companies asking them
[01:24:22.780 --> 01:24:25.940]   to denounce an order by the Texas government, the cost,
[01:24:25.940 --> 01:24:29.100]   called for child abuse investigations of parents
[01:24:29.100 --> 01:24:33.020]   who provide transgender children with gender affirming care.
[01:24:33.020 --> 01:24:36.260]   He wrote, I'm reaching out, yeah,
[01:24:36.260 --> 01:24:38.140]   I'm reaching out child abuse, thank you.
[01:24:38.140 --> 01:24:39.900]   I'm reaching out from Apple because we're hoping
[01:24:39.900 --> 01:24:42.100]   you'll join us and lend your company's name
[01:24:42.100 --> 01:24:43.740]   to a critical issue.
[01:24:43.740 --> 01:24:46.500]   Apple has joined the effort and will lend its name
[01:24:46.500 --> 01:24:48.780]   and logo, he said in the email.
[01:24:48.780 --> 01:24:51.100]   I'm reaching out because we're hoping you will too.
[01:24:51.100 --> 01:24:53.660]   Ultimately 60 other organizations signed onto the letter
[01:24:53.660 --> 01:24:56.500]   was published in the Dallas Morning News last night.
[01:24:56.500 --> 01:24:59.100]   - That in itself is a huge deal.
[01:24:59.100 --> 01:25:01.700]   It's one thing for Tim Cook to issue a press release
[01:25:01.700 --> 01:25:04.820]   or write letters to certain people.
[01:25:04.820 --> 01:25:07.620]   Basically saying that you can use the Apple logo,
[01:25:07.620 --> 01:25:12.220]   our most valuable piece of IP to just stand
[01:25:12.220 --> 01:25:15.540]   on one side of this issue, that is pretty emphatic.
[01:25:15.540 --> 01:25:19.780]   That's, it's hard to overstate what a big step that is.
[01:25:19.780 --> 01:25:23.180]   - Iowa State Senator Zach Nunn told Fox News,
[01:25:23.180 --> 01:25:25.860]   Apple framed the law as part of a social agenda
[01:25:25.860 --> 01:25:28.980]   rather than fairness, actually he's talking about,
[01:25:28.980 --> 01:25:31.340]   I think Title 11.
[01:25:31.340 --> 01:25:33.500]   But anyway, for women's sports,
[01:25:33.500 --> 01:25:35.620]   oh, this is the transgender,
[01:25:35.620 --> 01:25:38.140]   the band of transgender women in sports.
[01:25:38.140 --> 01:25:40.220]   That becomes a concerning issue
[01:25:40.220 --> 01:25:43.060]   when we have a major industry who attempts to come in
[01:25:43.060 --> 01:25:46.180]   and force public policy based on an agenda,
[01:25:46.180 --> 01:25:48.920]   they may have an abortum out of state.
[01:25:48.920 --> 01:25:51.460]   - They're anti-supremacy, it's amazing.
[01:25:51.460 --> 01:25:54.140]   - And I think that one of the things that we are going to see
[01:25:54.140 --> 01:25:57.220]   over the next decade is this fight between,
[01:25:57.220 --> 01:25:58.700]   and we're seeing this in the EU,
[01:25:58.700 --> 01:26:00.620]   we're seeing this in a lot of places,
[01:26:00.620 --> 01:26:03.940]   is the fight for relevancy for governments.
[01:26:03.940 --> 01:26:06.140]   You have these big companies,
[01:26:06.140 --> 01:26:08.900]   and we can, with all of these,
[01:26:08.900 --> 01:26:12.300]   I think that the reality is, is that the governments are,
[01:26:12.300 --> 01:26:14.140]   when you talk about any kind of antitrust,
[01:26:14.140 --> 01:26:17.340]   I think that there is a growing concern that they have,
[01:26:17.340 --> 01:26:21.460]   which is probably well-based,
[01:26:21.460 --> 01:26:24.020]   that they're not gonna matter much anymore.
[01:26:24.020 --> 01:26:26.420]   And so they're trying to figure out,
[01:26:26.420 --> 01:26:28.380]   they're losing the control to do that.
[01:26:28.380 --> 01:26:30.460]   And the reality is, is that there's probably not very much
[01:26:30.460 --> 01:26:31.460]   they can do about it.
[01:26:31.460 --> 01:26:33.220]   Like the corporations are going to become
[01:26:33.220 --> 01:26:34.780]   more powerful in being able,
[01:26:34.780 --> 01:26:36.420]   than any given government,
[01:26:36.420 --> 01:26:38.420]   if they keep on going the direction they're going.
[01:26:38.420 --> 01:26:39.660]   So that's why antitrust,
[01:26:39.660 --> 01:26:41.500]   and what I've been saying for a long time,
[01:26:41.500 --> 01:26:43.860]   is that antitrust is going to be the battle
[01:26:43.860 --> 01:26:45.900]   of the next, of our decade.
[01:26:45.900 --> 01:26:48.020]   Because it's, because what's happening is,
[01:26:48.020 --> 01:26:49.380]   is the governments are no longer,
[01:26:49.380 --> 01:26:51.780]   they just don't, they don't have the wherewithal
[01:26:51.780 --> 01:26:53.860]   because these are being global corporations,
[01:26:53.860 --> 01:26:55.540]   they just move things around.
[01:26:55.540 --> 01:26:57.420]   And they have the money to lobby,
[01:26:57.420 --> 01:27:00.140]   I mean, again, to go back to the telecommunications,
[01:27:00.140 --> 01:27:02.700]   you know, think is that it is crazy,
[01:27:02.700 --> 01:27:03.540]   like what's happening,
[01:27:03.540 --> 01:27:06.740]   I mean, they are literally doing damage to our society,
[01:27:06.740 --> 01:27:09.460]   by controlling telecommunications the way,
[01:27:09.460 --> 01:27:11.300]   I mean, like this is a real problem,
[01:27:11.300 --> 01:27:13.060]   as opposed to like the App Store.
[01:27:13.060 --> 01:27:14.740]   I mean, this is an actual problem,
[01:27:14.740 --> 01:27:16.500]   it affects many, many communities,
[01:27:16.500 --> 01:27:19.660]   you know, in lots of different ways.
[01:27:19.660 --> 01:27:21.340]   And no one talks about them,
[01:27:21.340 --> 01:27:23.300]   no one in Congress talks about them at all.
[01:27:23.300 --> 01:27:24.780]   You know, and they've just kind of decided that,
[01:27:24.780 --> 01:27:25.900]   because they stay in there, you know,
[01:27:25.900 --> 01:27:27.620]   they stay in their lane and they don't,
[01:27:27.620 --> 01:27:28.660]   you know, they don't do anything else.
[01:27:28.660 --> 01:27:31.020]   And it's, and you know, we really have to start thinking,
[01:27:31.020 --> 01:27:33.380]   you know, we have to start thinking, what's next?
[01:27:33.380 --> 01:27:35.860]   Because, you know, the way it's happening.
[01:27:35.860 --> 01:27:37.300]   - Kind of a contrarian on this.
[01:27:37.300 --> 01:27:41.140]   I don't think corporations should weigh in on politics at all.
[01:27:41.140 --> 01:27:43.420]   I think individuals can,
[01:27:43.420 --> 01:27:44.820]   if Tim Cook wants to write a letter,
[01:27:44.820 --> 01:27:46.940]   he absolutely should write a letter.
[01:27:46.940 --> 01:27:49.580]   This all goes back to Citizens United,
[01:27:49.580 --> 01:27:51.500]   which basically is a Supreme Court rule
[01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:56.500]   that corporations can spend unlimited money on all elections.
[01:27:56.500 --> 01:27:59.100]   That's a big, in my opinion,
[01:27:59.100 --> 01:28:00.820]   that's one of the biggest problems in the country.
[01:28:00.820 --> 01:28:05.140]   I don't think corporations on either side,
[01:28:05.140 --> 01:28:07.140]   I happen to agree with Apple's point of view,
[01:28:07.140 --> 01:28:09.260]   but I don't think corporations on either side
[01:28:09.260 --> 01:28:10.820]   should mark people. - Money is not speech.
[01:28:10.820 --> 01:28:12.340]   - Money is not speech.
[01:28:12.340 --> 01:28:14.420]   I disagree with the Supreme Court decision,
[01:28:14.420 --> 01:28:16.380]   and I think that this is one of the biggest problems
[01:28:16.380 --> 01:28:18.380]   we have in this country right now.
[01:28:18.380 --> 01:28:20.580]   - I do think that those are two different issues.
[01:28:20.580 --> 01:28:22.660]   Again, I think that at some point,
[01:28:22.660 --> 01:28:23.940]   when you're controlling a company
[01:28:23.940 --> 01:28:25.580]   of the size of Apple,
[01:28:25.580 --> 01:28:28.420]   that means that how many tens of thousands of people
[01:28:28.420 --> 01:28:33.180]   that are working for you are being hurt by a,
[01:28:33.180 --> 01:28:36.740]   but in this case, undeniably a bad law.
[01:28:36.740 --> 01:28:39.340]   Okay, and those,
[01:28:39.340 --> 01:28:42.140]   to some, I understand. - Well, to some,
[01:28:42.140 --> 01:28:44.180]   I understand. - I understand, but okay.
[01:28:44.180 --> 01:28:45.660]   No, I agree with you.
[01:28:45.660 --> 01:28:47.780]   - I agree with you. - Well, those people are dopes.
[01:28:47.780 --> 01:28:49.260]   - Yeah. - Those people are dopes.
[01:28:49.260 --> 01:28:51.780]   But at some point, you have to--
[01:28:51.780 --> 01:28:55.460]   - But is it in Apple's sphere?
[01:28:55.460 --> 01:28:58.220]   Is it something they should be commenting on?
[01:28:58.220 --> 01:28:59.780]   - Yeah. - Okay.
[01:28:59.780 --> 01:29:02.700]   I mean, I think Tim Cook-- - I do believe so.
[01:29:02.700 --> 01:29:04.500]   - Tell there's nobody left to comment.
[01:29:04.500 --> 01:29:07.740]   - Well, individuals should absolutely get involved
[01:29:07.740 --> 01:29:09.660]   and contribute and do everything they can.
[01:29:09.660 --> 01:29:12.900]   I just, I think corporations have so much might
[01:29:12.900 --> 01:29:14.220]   and so much money. - We have a huge problem though.
[01:29:14.220 --> 01:29:16.420]   It's like governments are losing,
[01:29:16.420 --> 01:29:17.940]   like they've lost the moral authority,
[01:29:17.940 --> 01:29:20.340]   even the thin veneer of moral authority
[01:29:20.340 --> 01:29:23.260]   that we pretended to have in the 50s, 60s, and 70s,
[01:29:23.260 --> 01:29:25.660]   when people at least tried to be nice outside,
[01:29:25.660 --> 01:29:27.420]   outside where the other people could see them,
[01:29:27.420 --> 01:29:30.100]   it's just like, I don't wanna be pessimistic about this
[01:29:30.100 --> 01:29:31.940]   'cause I have an optimistic person at heart.
[01:29:31.940 --> 01:29:36.180]   But like the stuff that goes on publicly, shamelessly,
[01:29:36.180 --> 01:29:38.900]   like could continuously, what would just,
[01:29:38.900 --> 01:29:40.140]   you know, I remember, I remember,
[01:29:40.140 --> 01:29:41.860]   like people would be a whiff of impropriety
[01:29:41.860 --> 01:29:43.020]   and people would have to resign
[01:29:43.020 --> 01:29:44.100]   or they couldn't run for office
[01:29:44.100 --> 01:29:45.180]   or they couldn't do anything.
[01:29:45.180 --> 01:29:46.620]   And now you have people basically
[01:29:46.620 --> 01:29:48.940]   baseball batting each other on the streets every day
[01:29:48.940 --> 01:29:49.860]   and they don't resign.
[01:29:49.860 --> 01:29:52.660]   Like it's just, there is no moral authority left.
[01:29:52.660 --> 01:29:55.300]   And I think it's unfortunately falling
[01:29:55.300 --> 01:29:59.100]   to some of the larger corporate leaders for good or for ill
[01:29:59.100 --> 01:30:01.300]   because some of them I agree with and some of them I don't,
[01:30:01.300 --> 01:30:03.700]   but there's a terrible vacuum of leadership,
[01:30:03.700 --> 01:30:04.980]   just not even in America,
[01:30:04.980 --> 01:30:06.780]   but just around the world right now.
[01:30:06.780 --> 01:30:09.340]   We see people partying in England getting fined now too.
[01:30:09.340 --> 01:30:11.220]   It's like, it's absolutely ridiculous
[01:30:11.220 --> 01:30:12.620]   what we're putting up with these days.
[01:30:12.620 --> 01:30:14.220]   We'd fire these people if they were employees
[01:30:14.220 --> 01:30:15.060]   in a heartbeat.
[01:30:15.060 --> 01:30:18.340]   - I had to go to the Wayback machine to find this
[01:30:18.340 --> 01:30:20.980]   'cause Microsoft has since deleted the tweet,
[01:30:20.980 --> 01:30:23.300]   but on the @Windows account,
[01:30:23.300 --> 01:30:25.660]   they tweeted, "Spring cleaning, check out these tips
[01:30:25.660 --> 01:30:28.740]   "on how to clean and run your device safely and smoothly
[01:30:28.740 --> 01:30:30.940]   "from Microsoft's Carmen's Latev.
[01:30:30.940 --> 01:30:32.980]   "What is that device she's running?
[01:30:32.980 --> 01:30:33.820]   "It matches her hair."
[01:30:33.820 --> 01:30:35.420]   - This is Apple, Apple got rid of the logo
[01:30:35.420 --> 01:30:36.420]   and this finally paid off.
[01:30:36.420 --> 01:30:37.980]   It's the whole reason they did it.
[01:30:37.980 --> 01:30:39.700]   So that one day the Windows account
[01:30:39.700 --> 01:30:40.700]   would tweet with nothing again.
[01:30:40.700 --> 01:30:42.900]   - And I'm back and of course,
[01:30:42.900 --> 01:30:44.460]   but you know what, let's put it this way.
[01:30:44.460 --> 01:30:46.940]   Microsoft is not anti-Apple anymore,
[01:30:46.940 --> 01:30:49.540]   but this I'm back is clearly not running Windows.
[01:30:49.540 --> 01:30:50.380]   It's an M1.
[01:30:50.380 --> 01:30:51.460]   - That's why it's so clean.
[01:30:51.460 --> 01:30:52.380]   (laughs)
[01:30:52.380 --> 01:30:56.220]   - It's cool too, because Mac OS is a cesspool of viruses
[01:30:56.220 --> 01:30:57.740]   and malware and phishing.
[01:30:57.740 --> 01:31:01.580]   - Windows, it just keeps itself clean.
[01:31:01.580 --> 01:31:02.900]   No one has to worry about Windows.
[01:31:02.900 --> 01:31:06.820]   They're helping these poor little backwater users
[01:31:06.820 --> 01:31:10.980]   with their 9.8% of the desktop market.
[01:31:10.980 --> 01:31:12.580]   Can't protect themselves.
[01:31:12.580 --> 01:31:14.500]   (laughs)
[01:31:14.500 --> 01:31:16.020]   - That's less Microsoft.
[01:31:16.020 --> 01:31:18.660]   - I saw the trailer for this and I got really excited,
[01:31:18.660 --> 01:31:22.180]   especially 'cause it's David Attenborough narrating it.
[01:31:22.180 --> 01:31:23.700]   - It looks so good.
[01:31:23.700 --> 01:31:25.620]   - To Apple TV plus.
[01:31:25.620 --> 01:31:26.620]   - Yeah.
[01:31:26.620 --> 01:31:28.380]   - So if you liked Planet Earth,
[01:31:28.380 --> 01:31:30.660]   which I loved in that and burrow also.
[01:31:30.660 --> 01:31:31.740]   - And very planet.
[01:31:31.740 --> 01:31:36.260]   - And tiny, well, but this is coming from the Planet Earth folks.
[01:31:36.260 --> 01:31:39.820]   The BBC Studios Natural History Unit.
[01:31:39.820 --> 01:31:41.060]   I got it, can I play this?
[01:31:41.060 --> 01:31:42.380]   Am I allowed to play this?
[01:31:42.380 --> 01:31:43.820]   It's an Apple TV.
[01:31:43.820 --> 01:31:45.140]   - Take this press release.
[01:31:45.140 --> 01:31:45.980]   - That'll make it fair use.
[01:31:45.980 --> 01:31:47.100]   - Yeah, fair use.
[01:31:47.100 --> 01:31:48.500]   I think this is so cool.
[01:31:48.500 --> 01:31:51.500]   So it's just like Planet Earth, you know.
[01:31:52.340 --> 01:31:53.180]   - Except that.
[01:31:53.180 --> 01:31:54.660]   - The costumes are super realistic.
[01:31:54.660 --> 01:31:55.500]   - Yes.
[01:31:55.500 --> 01:31:57.180]   - It's got dinosaurs.
[01:31:57.180 --> 01:31:58.340]   - Join us for the story.
[01:31:58.340 --> 01:31:59.180]   - With feathers.
[01:31:59.180 --> 01:32:00.020]   - Never heard.
[01:32:00.020 --> 01:32:02.860]   (dramatic music)
[01:32:02.860 --> 01:32:04.780]   - On a scale you've never witnessed.
[01:32:04.780 --> 01:32:08.020]   - It does such beautiful work.
[01:32:08.020 --> 01:32:12.220]   - This is prehistoric, Planet.
[01:32:12.220 --> 01:32:15.060]   Only on Apple TV.
[01:32:15.060 --> 01:32:16.700]   - So is that CGI?
[01:32:16.700 --> 01:32:17.540]   I guess it is.
[01:32:17.540 --> 01:32:19.300]   - The dinosaurs, they're not real.
[01:32:19.300 --> 01:32:20.220]   (laughs)
[01:32:20.220 --> 01:32:21.740]   - That is so much CGI.
[01:32:21.740 --> 01:32:22.660]   - The location.
[01:32:22.660 --> 01:32:23.500]   - Don't tell it.
[01:32:23.500 --> 01:32:24.340]   - Alex, you're reading it.
[01:32:24.340 --> 01:32:26.580]   - Film the location.
[01:32:26.580 --> 01:32:28.020]   - But I'm gonna tell you.
[01:32:28.020 --> 01:32:28.900]   - The other one is better.
[01:32:28.900 --> 01:32:29.740]   The other one is better.
[01:32:29.740 --> 01:32:31.340]   - Oh, let me show you the one with the turtles.
[01:32:31.340 --> 01:32:34.060]   Yeah, this really, I won't play the whole thing,
[01:32:34.060 --> 01:32:34.900]   but this really is.
[01:32:34.900 --> 01:32:35.740]   - Play the whole thing.
[01:32:35.740 --> 01:32:36.580]   Play the whole thing.
[01:32:36.580 --> 01:32:37.740]   - Okay, watch.
[01:32:37.740 --> 01:32:40.620]   - On the shore of the ancient Tethys Sea.
[01:32:40.620 --> 01:32:46.380]   And hundreds of tiny turtle hatchlings are on the move.
[01:32:49.100 --> 01:32:51.300]   So far, just like Planet Earth.
[01:32:51.300 --> 01:32:53.420]   - Towards the safety of the water.
[01:32:53.420 --> 01:32:54.580]   - This could be happening today.
[01:32:54.580 --> 01:32:57.380]   - Well, I think that footage is from Planet Earth,
[01:32:57.380 --> 01:32:59.140]   except instead of full-lithering snakes.
[01:32:59.140 --> 01:33:01.020]   - They're spotted by a hunter.
[01:33:01.020 --> 01:33:05.940]   For just as the true grilled bestow's life,
[01:33:05.940 --> 01:33:07.580]   the false trail removes.
[01:33:07.580 --> 01:33:10.180]   - The hunter in this case.
[01:33:10.180 --> 01:33:11.020]   - Feathers.
[01:33:11.020 --> 01:33:15.100]   - Is a baby.
[01:33:15.100 --> 01:33:16.580]   - A young T-Rex.
[01:33:16.580 --> 01:33:17.420]   - T-Rex.
[01:33:17.420 --> 01:33:20.220]   - Still sporting the juvenile's feathery coat.
[01:33:20.220 --> 01:33:21.540]   - Looks like a turkey.
[01:33:21.540 --> 01:33:24.460]   (laughing)
[01:33:24.460 --> 01:33:27.780]   - I presume this is backed by the latest science, you know.
[01:33:27.780 --> 01:33:28.780]   - You got the birds.
[01:33:28.780 --> 01:33:29.620]   - The birds.
[01:33:29.620 --> 01:33:32.060]   - They're still with us, the birds.
[01:33:32.060 --> 01:33:32.900]   - But it's a broom.
[01:33:32.900 --> 01:33:34.540]   - I still find it hard to believe that T-Rex
[01:33:34.540 --> 01:33:36.540]   had those stinjal arms.
[01:33:36.540 --> 01:33:38.340]   But watch out, here comes mama.
[01:33:38.340 --> 01:33:41.940]   - This could take some time.
[01:33:41.940 --> 01:33:44.380]   - So David Attenborough.
[01:33:46.260 --> 01:33:48.980]   - I'm sorry, sir David Attenborough.
[01:33:48.980 --> 01:33:50.260]   And here comes mama.
[01:33:50.260 --> 01:33:53.500]   - A little bit bigger.
[01:33:53.500 --> 01:33:54.780]   - A full-grown t-Rex.
[01:33:54.780 --> 01:33:55.980]   - I'm trying to use Xbox controller.
[01:33:55.980 --> 01:33:58.300]   - These are the most powerful predator.
[01:33:58.300 --> 01:34:02.900]   - I know this probably wasn't done with real engine five.
[01:34:02.900 --> 01:34:04.660]   - That's a brain father.
[01:34:04.660 --> 01:34:05.580]   - But it's pretty, yeah.
[01:34:05.580 --> 01:34:08.820]   It feels like, it does not feel like CGI, I have to say.
[01:34:08.820 --> 01:34:09.820]   - Yeah, it's really amazing.
[01:34:09.820 --> 01:34:11.740]   - But can Alex identify CGI by the textures?
[01:34:11.740 --> 01:34:13.300]   Do you know what company did it when you look at it, Alec?
[01:34:13.300 --> 01:34:14.140]   - Can you tell?
[01:34:15.140 --> 01:34:15.980]   - MPC.
[01:34:15.980 --> 01:34:18.100]   - I know that MPC.
[01:34:18.100 --> 01:34:18.940]   - Oh, you know what I'm saying?
[01:34:18.940 --> 01:34:20.020]   - It's right, okay.
[01:34:20.020 --> 01:34:20.940]   - It was MPC.
[01:34:20.940 --> 01:34:23.060]   They did "The Lion King" in the Jungle Book.
[01:34:23.060 --> 01:34:27.980]   Those, both of those, "The Disney Live Action" mixed with CGI.
[01:34:27.980 --> 01:34:29.500]   - Alex is super power.
[01:34:29.500 --> 01:34:30.540]   - But you have very impressive.
[01:34:30.540 --> 01:34:31.620]   - No, no, no, I didn't know it because of that.
[01:34:31.620 --> 01:34:32.460]   - You read the press.
[01:34:32.460 --> 01:34:33.340]   - There's a whole bunch of us on CG.
[01:34:33.340 --> 01:34:35.140]   Well, there's a bunch of us on a CG list
[01:34:35.140 --> 01:34:37.740]   that have been talking about it for a couple of days.
[01:34:37.740 --> 01:34:40.500]   So the, but the, it's incredible work.
[01:34:40.500 --> 01:34:43.980]   I mean, there is, it's just so much fun.
[01:34:43.980 --> 01:34:46.740]   And Apple's really flexing because it's so expensive
[01:34:46.740 --> 01:34:47.580]   to do what they're doing.
[01:34:47.580 --> 01:34:50.300]   Like this is now they're in the real money.
[01:34:50.300 --> 01:34:52.700]   You know, like of doing all CG and you know,
[01:34:52.700 --> 01:34:55.340]   that's like, you watch that little T-Rex running.
[01:34:55.340 --> 01:34:57.460]   Then all the little sand prints that all to watch too.
[01:34:57.460 --> 01:34:59.620]   It's not just the T-Rex, it's the little sand prints.
[01:34:59.620 --> 01:35:01.220]   - I can't, I can't wait to watch.
[01:35:01.220 --> 01:35:02.060]   - Oh, nice.
[01:35:02.060 --> 01:35:05.140]   - So they're also gonna do something interesting.
[01:35:05.140 --> 01:35:07.220]   It's five episodes.
[01:35:07.220 --> 01:35:09.220]   And you know, in the past what Apple's done with new series
[01:35:09.220 --> 01:35:11.220]   is they've released three and then next week
[01:35:11.220 --> 01:35:12.820]   and another one and next week and another one.
[01:35:12.820 --> 01:35:14.900]   This, this time they're gonna do it Monday through Friday,
[01:35:14.900 --> 01:35:18.220]   five days in a row, May 23rd through 27th,
[01:35:18.220 --> 01:35:20.100]   which I think is very interesting.
[01:35:20.100 --> 01:35:22.820]   - Well, there'd be a crossover Jurassic Central Park.
[01:35:22.820 --> 01:35:25.380]   (laughing)
[01:35:25.380 --> 01:35:26.740]   That would be fun.
[01:35:26.740 --> 01:35:28.820]   - A dinosaur version of Friends.
[01:35:28.820 --> 01:35:29.860]   That's Central Perk.
[01:35:29.860 --> 01:35:31.500]   - That's Central Perk, yeah.
[01:35:31.500 --> 01:35:33.020]   - They wanna break Andy.
[01:35:33.020 --> 01:35:36.460]   - And of course, who else but Hans Zimmer doing the score?
[01:35:36.460 --> 01:35:37.460]   - Yeah.
[01:35:37.460 --> 01:35:38.700]   - This is, you know what?
[01:35:38.700 --> 01:35:40.860]   I don't, I'm not sure what Apple's spending money
[01:35:40.860 --> 01:35:41.700]   in politics.
[01:35:41.700 --> 01:35:43.900]   They could spend all the money they want
[01:35:43.900 --> 01:35:46.140]   on Apple TV shows like this.
[01:35:46.140 --> 01:35:48.420]   'Cause honestly, no network would do this.
[01:35:48.420 --> 01:35:50.420]   - It just doesn't, yeah.
[01:35:50.420 --> 01:35:52.460]   There's no financial reason to do this.
[01:35:52.460 --> 01:35:54.220]   I mean, there is a financial reason,
[01:35:54.220 --> 01:35:56.700]   but there's no like broadcast traditional,
[01:35:56.700 --> 01:35:58.260]   like in the BBC did something like this,
[01:35:58.260 --> 01:35:59.660]   I think called dinosaurs.
[01:35:59.660 --> 01:36:02.820]   So they definitely did something like this in the past
[01:36:02.820 --> 01:36:05.220]   that was like the idea was like this,
[01:36:05.220 --> 01:36:07.820]   but it did not have anywhere near the budget.
[01:36:07.820 --> 01:36:08.660]   This one does.
[01:36:08.660 --> 01:36:12.420]   It just, you just hear the money just rolling out
[01:36:12.420 --> 01:36:14.460]   in truckloads to pay for that.
[01:36:14.460 --> 01:36:17.340]   Just that trailer worth of visual effects.
[01:36:17.340 --> 01:36:20.020]   It'll, a whole series like, wow.
[01:36:20.020 --> 01:36:21.660]   And I love, I have to admit,
[01:36:21.660 --> 01:36:23.860]   I've thought about this for years
[01:36:23.860 --> 01:36:26.260]   that someone should do one that it really makes you feel
[01:36:26.260 --> 01:36:29.180]   like you're there with Attenborough and everything else.
[01:36:29.180 --> 01:36:30.900]   And when I, as soon as I saw it pop out,
[01:36:30.900 --> 01:36:32.740]   I was just like, oh my goodness,
[01:36:32.740 --> 01:36:34.340]   this is gonna be so awesome.
[01:36:34.340 --> 01:36:36.820]   So hopefully my expectations aren't painfully high.
[01:36:36.820 --> 01:36:38.180]   That's the only thing I'm worried about.
[01:36:38.180 --> 01:36:39.820]   Also announced for Apple TV,
[01:36:39.820 --> 01:36:43.300]   plus if you are a big fan of Ted Lasso,
[01:36:43.300 --> 01:36:44.940]   they've got its co-creator,
[01:36:44.940 --> 01:36:47.020]   showrunner Bill Lawrence,
[01:36:47.020 --> 01:36:49.460]   to create a new show for them called Shrinking,
[01:36:49.460 --> 01:36:52.580]   a 10 episode comedy series,
[01:36:52.580 --> 01:36:57.580]   starring Jason Segal and Harrison Ford in Deadline.
[01:36:57.580 --> 01:37:02.060]   The line is Ford, who is joining Shrinking
[01:37:02.060 --> 01:37:04.460]   after lengthy negotiations,
[01:37:04.460 --> 01:37:07.060]   which I would read between the lines to say,
[01:37:07.060 --> 01:37:09.380]   "I've got a lot of money."
[01:37:09.380 --> 01:37:11.820]   So I don't, has he done TV before?
[01:37:11.820 --> 01:37:12.740]   I don't think so.
[01:37:12.740 --> 01:37:13.580]   I don't think so.
[01:37:13.580 --> 01:37:14.420]   No, he was the first one.
[01:37:14.420 --> 01:37:18.900]   He did one appearance on "Young Indiana Jones Chronicles."
[01:37:18.900 --> 01:37:22.300]   And of course, we'll never forget the Star Wars Christmas.
[01:37:22.300 --> 01:37:23.460]   Holiday special, of course.
[01:37:23.460 --> 01:37:28.340]   Well, we tried to forget, but it keeps coming back.
[01:37:28.340 --> 01:37:32.540]   So it has been a while since he did any TV.
[01:37:32.540 --> 01:37:37.540]   He plays a psychiatrist, a grieving therapist who,
[01:37:37.540 --> 01:37:39.260]   oh no, I'm sorry.
[01:37:39.260 --> 01:37:40.820]   Segal plays a grieving therapist
[01:37:40.820 --> 01:37:42.020]   who starts to break the rules
[01:37:42.020 --> 01:37:44.460]   and tell his clients exactly what he thinks.
[01:37:44.460 --> 01:37:46.620]   (laughing)
[01:37:46.620 --> 01:37:50.380]   Okay, Ford will play Dr. Phil Rhodes,
[01:37:50.380 --> 01:37:53.420]   a down-to-earth sharpest-tacked blue collar shrink,
[01:37:53.420 --> 01:37:56.000]   blunt, but with an ever-present twinkle.
[01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:01.060]   Okay, anyway, well, you know, I look forward to it.
[01:38:01.060 --> 01:38:04.820]   Again, you got the scratch.
[01:38:04.820 --> 01:38:09.020]   You can get movie stars to appear on TV.
[01:38:09.020 --> 01:38:14.020]   I guess they got them a deal on a G5 or something.
[01:38:14.020 --> 01:38:16.780]   What helicopter do you want?
[01:38:16.780 --> 01:38:18.500]   (laughing)
[01:38:18.500 --> 01:38:20.460]   What licenses have not been taken away from you,
[01:38:20.460 --> 01:38:22.540]   you get Harrison, we will get you the best aircraft.
[01:38:22.540 --> 01:38:24.900]   Whatever you want, sir, whatever you want.
[01:38:24.900 --> 01:38:28.260]   iPhone builds, now this, I don't know
[01:38:28.260 --> 01:38:30.220]   if this is true, this comes from loop,
[01:38:30.220 --> 01:38:32.340]   capital and a research note.
[01:38:32.340 --> 01:38:37.340]   iPhone builds have dropped another 9,000,000 to 254,000,000,
[01:38:37.340 --> 01:38:40.020]   saying additional cuts are coming
[01:38:40.020 --> 01:38:41.900]   in the not-too-distant future.
[01:38:41.900 --> 01:38:48.060]   The orders for 2022 are expected to range
[01:38:48.060 --> 01:38:52.500]   for the entire year, between 245 and 250,000,000,000.
[01:38:52.500 --> 01:38:55.540]   The SE is gonna have its orders cut by 20,000,000.
[01:38:56.820 --> 01:39:01.380]   Why? Services, baby.
[01:39:01.380 --> 01:39:06.380]   Also, smaller iPhones have a finite following.
[01:39:06.380 --> 01:39:10.220]   Yeah, it's also like, well, some of these,
[01:39:10.220 --> 01:39:11.780]   you have to be very careful with these
[01:39:11.780 --> 01:39:13.300]   because some of them are just stock manipulation,
[01:39:13.300 --> 01:39:15.300]   like blatant patent stock manipulation.
[01:39:15.300 --> 01:39:17.500]   And you can see the headline come up and it'll disappear.
[01:39:17.500 --> 01:39:18.580]   It'll be there with no buy- - That's why I mentioned it.
[01:39:18.580 --> 01:39:20.620]   - It's from the sand. - Like even major publications
[01:39:20.620 --> 01:39:22.660]   will be like no buy-lined and it'll disappear
[01:39:22.660 --> 01:39:24.180]   and it's really startling.
[01:39:24.180 --> 01:39:27.340]   But also, we've seen this before,
[01:39:27.340 --> 01:39:29.140]   whenever there's a super cycle,
[01:39:29.140 --> 01:39:31.540]   you're not magically creating new customers,
[01:39:31.540 --> 01:39:33.180]   you're pulling customers forward.
[01:39:33.180 --> 01:39:36.140]   That's why when there was massive spend on the iPhone 6,
[01:39:36.140 --> 01:39:37.860]   the iPhone 6s didn't do as well.
[01:39:37.860 --> 01:39:38.740]   It's like, you're not gonna just,
[01:39:38.740 --> 01:39:41.220]   not all of them are gonna go buy another iPhone immediately.
[01:39:41.220 --> 01:39:44.500]   And we had massive spend on consumer electronics in 2020,
[01:39:44.500 --> 01:39:47.020]   trailing into 2021, as everybody was stuck at home.
[01:39:47.020 --> 01:39:48.980]   They were all buying new things, everyone was upgrading,
[01:39:48.980 --> 01:39:51.860]   there was a major upgrade with the iPhone 12, iPhone 13 as well.
[01:39:51.860 --> 01:39:53.740]   So you're pulling those customers forward.
[01:39:53.740 --> 01:39:57.180]   And now we'll get probably the low season
[01:39:57.180 --> 01:39:58.820]   before we get to iPhone 14.
[01:39:58.820 --> 01:40:01.020]   And some of that is just, I believe it's just like
[01:40:01.020 --> 01:40:03.940]   the iPhone SE isn't selling well, but it's really,
[01:40:03.940 --> 01:40:07.220]   all it is is a 5G, previous iPhone SE,
[01:40:07.220 --> 01:40:09.380]   which is halfway through its lifespan
[01:40:09.380 --> 01:40:12.100]   and they're gonna shift some of that to the iPhone 13.
[01:40:12.100 --> 01:40:14.220]   They're the larger sizes which are doing well
[01:40:14.220 --> 01:40:16.180]   and they'll address it with a larger cheaper iPhone
[01:40:16.180 --> 01:40:17.820]   and the iPhone 14.
[01:40:17.820 --> 01:40:20.100]   So it's like a combination of all these factors.
[01:40:20.100 --> 01:40:21.940]   And Apple will tell you every earnings call,
[01:40:21.940 --> 01:40:24.500]   "Don't look at one report because our supply chain
[01:40:24.500 --> 01:40:25.820]   is incredibly complicated.
[01:40:25.820 --> 01:40:27.140]   And if we give you any advice,
[01:40:27.140 --> 01:40:28.260]   please listen to that advice.
[01:40:28.260 --> 01:40:29.820]   Don't look at just one thing."
[01:40:29.820 --> 01:40:30.900]   So we'll get their numbers,
[01:40:30.900 --> 01:40:33.340]   but I always take these numbers with a grain of salt.
[01:40:33.340 --> 01:40:36.020]   - Yeah, Gurman is saying, he said it on March 26th,
[01:40:36.020 --> 01:40:38.300]   a couple of days ago, Apple, and we've heard this before,
[01:40:38.300 --> 01:40:42.500]   is considering launching a rugged watch this year.
[01:40:42.500 --> 01:40:46.060]   Oh wait a minute, this is from a year ago, nevermind, forget it.
[01:40:46.060 --> 01:40:47.260]   This isn't a new story.
[01:40:47.260 --> 01:40:49.420]   This is an old story that I just got the date wrong.
[01:40:49.420 --> 01:40:51.580]   Nevermind, we've been hearing this report.
[01:40:51.580 --> 01:40:53.980]   He said it would happen maybe in 2021.
[01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:56.060]   That did not happen maybe in 2022.
[01:40:56.060 --> 01:40:58.020]   Still something.
[01:40:58.020 --> 01:40:59.300]   - I don't know if you saw John Prosser's video
[01:40:59.300 --> 01:41:01.380]   where he said that his mistake was he got,
[01:41:01.380 --> 01:41:03.260]   he thought everything that was coming last,
[01:41:03.260 --> 01:41:05.260]   the things that he reported as coming last year
[01:41:05.260 --> 01:41:07.180]   are actually coming this year or next year,
[01:41:07.180 --> 01:41:09.620]   that he was two years ahead instead of one year ahead.
[01:41:09.620 --> 01:41:11.540]   So he's gonna take a little sabbatical
[01:41:11.540 --> 01:41:13.380]   from the rumors for a while, calm down,
[01:41:13.380 --> 01:41:18.020]   and then reassess where in their timeline they actually fit.
[01:41:18.020 --> 01:41:20.020]   So that flattened watch he thinks is more likely
[01:41:20.020 --> 01:41:22.780]   for this year and that flat backed iPhone
[01:41:22.780 --> 01:41:24.100]   more likely for next year.
[01:41:24.100 --> 01:41:29.060]   - Ladies and gentlemen, would you like to boot System 7
[01:41:29.060 --> 01:41:31.900]   or System 8 on your Mac?
[01:41:31.900 --> 01:41:35.500]   Well I can boot it on my Linux machine, here we go.
[01:41:35.500 --> 01:41:36.540]   - Nice as writer.
[01:41:36.540 --> 01:41:40.340]   - I still use Nises writer, they still have it.
[01:41:40.340 --> 01:41:45.340]   So this is actually a JavaScript version of,
[01:41:45.340 --> 01:41:49.820]   let's see how, oh look at that, CPU energy saver.
[01:41:49.820 --> 01:41:50.660]   (buzzer)
[01:41:50.660 --> 01:41:54.780]   It's not installed, put it in the control panels and restart.
[01:41:54.780 --> 01:41:56.380]   Okay, wow.
[01:41:56.380 --> 01:41:58.500]   - Give me Remdubler and Distubler.
[01:41:58.500 --> 01:42:01.260]   Let's really test this out.
[01:42:01.260 --> 01:42:02.340]   - Portables, what's that?
[01:42:02.340 --> 01:42:04.300]   Let's see what's in here.
[01:42:04.300 --> 01:42:08.820]   Portable PowerBook File Assistant, oh wow, okay.
[01:42:08.820 --> 01:42:11.620]   That's what they mean, not iPads.
[01:42:11.620 --> 01:42:14.580]   Let's play a game, shall we play a game?
[01:42:14.580 --> 01:42:16.020]   - Dark Castle.
[01:42:16.020 --> 01:42:17.460]   - Do they have Dark Castle on here?
[01:42:17.460 --> 01:42:22.060]   Yes they do, they have lots, F/A/18 Hornet, Glide.
[01:42:22.060 --> 01:42:23.380]   Oh wait a minute, should we play Glider?
[01:42:23.380 --> 01:42:25.700]   Remember what, that was a really popular game, yeah.
[01:42:25.700 --> 01:42:26.540]   - Oh wow.
[01:42:26.540 --> 01:42:31.540]   - Let's see, room editor, Glider for 68K Macs or for PowerPC.
[01:42:31.540 --> 01:42:34.540]   I don't know what I'm running.
[01:42:34.540 --> 01:42:36.540]   (laughing)
[01:42:36.540 --> 01:42:39.100]   I don't know what lie I'm telling you here.
[01:42:39.100 --> 01:42:41.980]   Do we want two colors, let's go for 16 color.
[01:42:41.980 --> 01:42:44.980]   Oh look at this, new keyboard switching default
[01:42:44.980 --> 01:42:47.060]   keyboard controls, okay.
[01:42:47.060 --> 01:42:49.860]   This was a great game on the Mac.
[01:42:49.860 --> 01:42:50.700]   - Yeah.
[01:42:50.700 --> 01:42:53.700]   - I don't know if I can get past the splash screen though.
[01:42:53.700 --> 01:42:56.380]   Maybe I don't have the right keyboard.
[01:42:56.380 --> 01:42:57.660]   Let's see, new game.
[01:42:57.660 --> 01:42:59.420]   - You've gotta do a studio display update Leo.
[01:42:59.420 --> 01:43:00.700]   - Yeah, clearly.
[01:43:00.700 --> 01:43:02.180]   - Oh here it is.
[01:43:02.180 --> 01:43:03.980]   Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[01:43:03.980 --> 01:43:05.620]   (dramatic music)
[01:43:05.620 --> 01:43:07.580]   Ah, you gotta figure out the keyboard.
[01:43:07.580 --> 01:43:08.900]   (laughing)
[01:43:08.900 --> 01:43:10.740]   The original Flappy Bird.
[01:43:10.740 --> 01:43:11.860]   - No birds were harmed.
[01:43:11.860 --> 01:43:15.700]   - In this game, the goal was to keep this glider going
[01:43:15.700 --> 01:43:16.940]   by pressing the right buttons,
[01:43:16.940 --> 01:43:18.540]   but I apparently don't have it.
[01:43:18.540 --> 01:43:20.580]   - And there are air vents on the floor.
[01:43:20.580 --> 01:43:22.180]   - Yeah, yeah, this is a fun game.
[01:43:22.180 --> 01:43:23.300]   Yeah, game over, man.
[01:43:23.300 --> 01:43:24.300]   Game over.
[01:43:24.300 --> 01:43:28.660]   Let's see, options, controls.
[01:43:28.660 --> 01:43:29.500]   Here we go.
[01:43:29.500 --> 01:43:32.500]   Hold keyboard, drop keyboard.
[01:43:32.500 --> 01:43:34.460]   (laughing)
[01:43:34.460 --> 01:43:37.660]   Mouse or just do mouse, okay.
[01:43:37.660 --> 01:43:39.700]   Okay, okay, maybe I can play it now.
[01:43:39.700 --> 01:43:41.780]   I really know, I'm really anxious.
[01:43:41.780 --> 01:43:43.540]   We'll do dark castle in a bit.
[01:43:43.540 --> 01:43:45.660]   Oh yeah, look.
[01:43:45.660 --> 01:43:47.180]   Oh yeah, easier with the mouse.
[01:43:47.180 --> 01:43:48.020]   Whoa.
[01:43:48.020 --> 01:43:50.580]   (upbeat music)
[01:43:50.580 --> 01:43:51.820]   Okay, that's enough of that.
[01:43:51.820 --> 01:43:53.460]   All right, let's get out of this.
[01:43:53.460 --> 01:43:54.980]   I guess I can't.
[01:43:54.980 --> 01:43:57.180]   Sorry guys, I'm stuck.
[01:43:57.180 --> 01:44:01.780]   - Well, if it's system seven, maybe it's just frozen.
[01:44:01.780 --> 01:44:04.040]   (laughing)
[01:44:04.040 --> 01:44:07.980]   You also have, that was system seven.
[01:44:07.980 --> 01:44:09.820]   There's also Mac OS 8.
[01:44:09.820 --> 01:44:15.500]   This is thanks to a guy named Mihai Parparita.
[01:44:16.140 --> 01:44:19.220]   And you just run it in your browser,
[01:44:19.220 --> 01:44:24.060]   system seven.app or macos8.app.
[01:44:24.060 --> 01:44:27.060]   Those are the websites.
[01:44:27.060 --> 01:44:28.100]   That's pretty cool.
[01:44:28.100 --> 01:44:28.940]   Nicely done.
[01:44:28.940 --> 01:44:31.420]   - It's amazing that JavaScript can be executed that quickly.
[01:44:31.420 --> 01:44:33.060]   - Yeah, I know we're immediately
[01:44:33.060 --> 01:44:34.380]   in a very, very old machine.
[01:44:34.380 --> 01:44:35.780]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[01:44:35.780 --> 01:44:37.940]   But I mean, JavaScript, JavaScript,
[01:44:37.940 --> 01:44:41.860]   it was never designed to be ambitious,
[01:44:41.860 --> 01:44:44.020]   but boy, the developments that have been happening
[01:44:44.020 --> 01:44:49.020]   in Safari and Chrome to make a container for apps
[01:44:49.020 --> 01:44:50.420]   to be that responsive.
[01:44:50.420 --> 01:44:52.460]   It's something that's,
[01:44:52.460 --> 01:44:56.700]   I enjoy being this old to be able to appreciate
[01:44:56.700 --> 01:44:57.860]   the trick that they pulled off there.
[01:44:57.860 --> 01:44:59.540]   - Andy, you wanted an ISIS writer?
[01:44:59.540 --> 01:45:00.380]   Did you play it?
[01:45:00.380 --> 01:45:01.300]   Here we go.
[01:45:01.300 --> 01:45:04.820]   ISIS, oh, error 12.
[01:45:04.820 --> 01:45:06.220]   Dang, nabbit.
[01:45:06.220 --> 01:45:09.300]   (laughing)
[01:45:09.300 --> 01:45:10.340]   I'll have to figure that out,
[01:45:10.340 --> 01:45:11.820]   I'll have to debug that.
[01:45:11.820 --> 01:45:12.940]   Wow, this is kind of amazing.
[01:45:12.940 --> 01:45:15.220]   This really brings back some memories.
[01:45:15.220 --> 01:45:16.820]   - Yeah, wow.
[01:45:16.820 --> 01:45:17.660]   There's something,
[01:45:17.660 --> 01:45:19.660]   there really is something about like,
[01:45:19.660 --> 01:45:22.340]   I don't know, it's not just nostalgia.
[01:45:22.340 --> 01:45:24.460]   It's that it was a style.
[01:45:24.460 --> 01:45:27.060]   It was, it's like, just like there's a style of music,
[01:45:27.060 --> 01:45:28.780]   there's a style of filmmaking.
[01:45:28.780 --> 01:45:33.340]   Those big pixels that the small amount of real estate
[01:45:33.340 --> 01:45:36.940]   that forced developers to not clutter up the interface
[01:45:36.940 --> 01:45:38.580]   that much.
[01:45:38.580 --> 01:45:39.460]   And yeah, it really does,
[01:45:39.460 --> 01:45:42.700]   when you get back to like a really good
[01:45:42.700 --> 01:45:44.740]   later version of MacRide or HyperCard,
[01:45:44.740 --> 01:45:47.540]   I still wish that there were a real hypercard
[01:45:47.540 --> 01:45:48.980]   for the iPad.
[01:45:48.980 --> 01:45:51.340]   And I know that we have--
[01:45:51.340 --> 01:45:53.340]   - I agree, it's nothing this bad.
[01:45:53.340 --> 01:45:54.180]   - No.
[01:45:54.180 --> 01:45:57.020]   - And I know the Swift Playgrounds is hypercard times 1,000.
[01:45:57.020 --> 01:45:59.860]   The fun of just putting graphics on a card
[01:45:59.860 --> 01:46:01.460]   and then just a button that takes a thousand times.
[01:46:01.460 --> 01:46:02.540]   - It's a thousand times more complicated too,
[01:46:02.540 --> 01:46:03.380]   that's the problem.
[01:46:03.380 --> 01:46:04.660]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:46:04.660 --> 01:46:08.020]   Hulu has added SharePlay support for iPhone and iPad users.
[01:46:08.020 --> 01:46:09.340]   Woo hoo.
[01:46:09.340 --> 01:46:10.180]   - Good for you.
[01:46:10.180 --> 01:46:11.980]   - Good for you.
[01:46:11.980 --> 01:46:13.700]   - And here's a new app from Epic Games
[01:46:13.700 --> 01:46:16.660]   that lets you, oh you know about this, Reality Scan.
[01:46:16.660 --> 01:46:18.420]   I think you told us about this.
[01:46:18.420 --> 01:46:20.420]   Didn't you Alex?
[01:46:20.420 --> 01:46:22.500]   - I did not, but I think it's great.
[01:46:22.500 --> 01:46:25.260]   - A free 3D scanning app in developing--
[01:46:25.260 --> 01:46:26.100]   - Yeah, it's--
[01:46:26.100 --> 01:46:27.740]   - In collaboration with Quicksail,
[01:46:27.740 --> 01:46:30.700]   turns your iPhone into photos
[01:46:30.700 --> 01:46:33.380]   into high fidelity 3D models.
[01:46:33.380 --> 01:46:36.620]   - Yeah, I've started, I just downloaded it last yesterday.
[01:46:36.620 --> 01:46:37.460]   - Okay.
[01:46:37.460 --> 01:46:39.700]   - So I haven't, you know, it's a, there's a,
[01:46:39.700 --> 01:46:41.780]   by the way, if you're listening to this
[01:46:41.780 --> 01:46:43.100]   and you can get into it,
[01:46:43.100 --> 01:46:45.060]   you have to make the request for the text,
[01:46:45.060 --> 01:46:47.940]   it's the first 10,000 people to make a request
[01:46:47.940 --> 01:46:49.820]   for the test flight right now.
[01:46:49.820 --> 01:46:51.900]   And so I jumped on it as soon as I saw it.
[01:46:51.900 --> 01:46:53.820]   Someone sent it to me and--
[01:46:53.820 --> 01:46:55.980]   - So she's doing photogrammetry basically, right?
[01:46:55.980 --> 01:46:58.700]   She's running her phone around her chair
[01:46:58.700 --> 01:47:00.460]   and creating a 3D object.
[01:47:00.460 --> 01:47:03.100]   - Yeah, and this is utilizing Reality Capture,
[01:47:03.100 --> 01:47:05.900]   which is a company that Epic bought,
[01:47:05.900 --> 01:47:07.620]   I think a year or two ago.
[01:47:07.620 --> 01:47:10.780]   And so there's a lot of heavy tech.
[01:47:10.780 --> 01:47:12.220]   This isn't like just hacked together.
[01:47:12.220 --> 01:47:13.340]   This is a lot of heavy tech.
[01:47:13.340 --> 01:47:16.180]   And this is a mixture of using, I believe,
[01:47:16.180 --> 01:47:17.740]   actually I haven't, I don't look,
[01:47:17.740 --> 01:47:19.700]   but in my early plane with it,
[01:47:19.700 --> 01:47:23.220]   it appears to be a mixture of LiDAR and photogrammetry,
[01:47:23.220 --> 01:47:25.020]   which we've always thought is gonna be kind of
[01:47:25.020 --> 01:47:27.660]   the Holy Grail, which is that the LiDAR
[01:47:27.660 --> 01:47:32.660]   means that I can very quickly know where the camera is
[01:47:32.660 --> 01:47:35.940]   in relationship to the object,
[01:47:35.940 --> 01:47:37.420]   which means it'll be much more accurate
[01:47:37.420 --> 01:47:41.820]   and it'll set a framework of accuracy across that piece.
[01:47:41.820 --> 01:47:43.780]   The photogrammetry adds all the detail
[01:47:43.780 --> 01:47:45.860]   and the textures back into it.
[01:47:45.860 --> 01:47:48.140]   And so I think that, and it's really,
[01:47:48.140 --> 01:47:49.980]   the UI is really, really nice,
[01:47:49.980 --> 01:47:52.100]   even in the test flight version.
[01:47:52.100 --> 01:47:53.500]   So I'm pretty excited about it.
[01:47:53.500 --> 01:47:55.740]   I haven't had time yesterday, I downloaded it,
[01:47:55.740 --> 01:47:56.740]   but it was a really busy day,
[01:47:56.740 --> 01:47:58.220]   so I haven't really dug into it.
[01:47:58.220 --> 01:48:03.220]   But I think that the UI is really, really nice.
[01:48:03.220 --> 01:48:05.740]   The performance looks really, really good.
[01:48:05.740 --> 01:48:08.940]   I would highly recommend trying to download it right now.
[01:48:08.940 --> 01:48:10.860]   If you're listening right now, right now.
[01:48:10.860 --> 01:48:12.860]   - Yeah, 10,000 will be gone for that.
[01:48:12.860 --> 01:48:14.940]   Look at this armchair.
[01:48:14.940 --> 01:48:19.020]   As I zoom into it, it's actually amazing, the detail.
[01:48:19.020 --> 01:48:21.060]   - It's quite vivid.
[01:48:21.060 --> 01:48:23.340]   - Remember, this is also what's coming to,
[01:48:23.340 --> 01:48:28.100]   this potentially can be a great app to generate USDZ files
[01:48:28.100 --> 01:48:31.860]   for what I do think Apple will talk about at WWC.
[01:48:31.860 --> 01:48:35.020]   So I think that, I think we're gonna probably,
[01:48:35.020 --> 01:48:36.860]   I mean, every time Apple does a keynote,
[01:48:36.860 --> 01:48:39.060]   I know I say this, but I keep on thinking that,
[01:48:39.060 --> 01:48:41.020]   eventually, keynote's gonna let us put those objects
[01:48:41.020 --> 01:48:42.300]   into a keynote.
[01:48:42.300 --> 01:48:43.340]   And--
[01:48:43.340 --> 01:48:44.260]   - So here's the question.
[01:48:44.260 --> 01:48:45.380]   - Presentations will be had.
[01:48:45.380 --> 01:48:47.340]   - Will Apple invite Epic Games onto the stage
[01:48:47.340 --> 01:48:49.220]   to show capturing reality?
[01:48:49.220 --> 01:48:51.060]   - No, no.
[01:48:51.060 --> 01:48:51.900]   - Not Tim Epic.
[01:48:51.900 --> 01:48:53.260]   - No, no.
[01:48:53.260 --> 01:48:55.820]   So this is, I guess, from Epic Games.
[01:48:55.820 --> 01:48:57.180]   So that's kind of interesting.
[01:48:57.180 --> 01:48:58.020]   Yeah.
[01:48:58.020 --> 01:49:03.700]   Post-partum exercises are coming to Apple Fitness Plus.
[01:49:03.700 --> 01:49:04.540]   That's good.
[01:49:04.540 --> 01:49:05.460]   - I'm getting better all the time.
[01:49:05.460 --> 01:49:06.780]   - I'm excited, I know.
[01:49:06.780 --> 01:49:11.380]   - Somebody crazy made the world's first Android phone
[01:49:11.380 --> 01:49:13.780]   with a lightning port.
[01:49:13.780 --> 01:49:14.620]   - Don't you love it?
[01:49:14.620 --> 01:49:15.460]   Look, this is amazing.
[01:49:15.460 --> 01:49:17.060]   I love this so much.
[01:49:17.060 --> 01:49:18.900]   - Don't tell me I can't do something.
[01:49:18.900 --> 01:49:20.860]   (laughing)
[01:49:20.860 --> 01:49:22.540]   - I've got sources in China,
[01:49:22.540 --> 01:49:23.820]   I can make whatever I want.
[01:49:23.820 --> 01:49:25.180]   - He actually made it--
[01:49:25.180 --> 01:49:27.180]   - I've felt with a working USB-C port,
[01:49:27.180 --> 01:49:29.380]   now he's doing an Android phone with a lightning port.
[01:49:29.380 --> 01:49:30.220]   - Well, fair is fairly.
[01:49:30.220 --> 01:49:31.780]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:49:31.780 --> 01:49:33.660]   That's right.
[01:49:33.660 --> 01:49:35.540]   I guess he shows he could do anything.
[01:49:35.540 --> 01:49:38.700]   And if you are a CleanMyMac X user from MacPaw,
[01:49:38.700 --> 01:49:40.340]   remember we've talked about MacPaw,
[01:49:40.340 --> 01:49:43.620]   they are a Ukrainian company.
[01:49:43.620 --> 01:49:47.020]   They have now added features to CleanMyMac X
[01:49:47.020 --> 01:49:52.020]   that will discover malicious software from Russia,
[01:49:52.020 --> 01:49:54.500]   or Belarus.
[01:49:54.500 --> 01:49:56.460]   So if any of the applications are developed
[01:49:56.460 --> 01:49:58.980]   by or hosted in Russia or Belarus,
[01:49:58.980 --> 01:50:02.260]   CleanMyMac X will mark them as suspicious
[01:50:02.260 --> 01:50:06.100]   if it's met a shape from AGI Soft
[01:50:06.100 --> 01:50:08.820]   and you know it's okay, you can unmark it,
[01:50:08.820 --> 01:50:11.860]   but yeah, this is interesting.
[01:50:11.860 --> 01:50:15.460]   And they're pointing out in the 2016 Russia
[01:50:15.460 --> 01:50:19.540]   obliged all online services and providers
[01:50:19.540 --> 01:50:22.020]   with a presence in Russia to store date user data
[01:50:22.020 --> 01:50:26.140]   on servers in Russia, which the FSB can access on request
[01:50:26.140 --> 01:50:27.260]   without a court order.
[01:50:27.260 --> 01:50:29.540]   So yeah, I guess you probably don't wanna be sending
[01:50:29.540 --> 01:50:32.980]   any important data back to Russia.
[01:50:32.980 --> 01:50:36.620]   Finally, I fix it, tear down, you mentioned this
[01:50:36.620 --> 01:50:40.500]   at the studio display, is it secretly an iMac?
[01:50:40.500 --> 01:50:43.300]   Now that's a provocative headline.
[01:50:43.300 --> 01:50:45.260]   - It pretty much is though, like if you took out the,
[01:50:45.260 --> 01:50:47.220]   if you took out the A13 and stuck in an M1,
[01:50:47.220 --> 01:50:49.620]   you wouldn't have a half bad computer there.
[01:50:49.620 --> 01:50:50.940]   - Yeah.
[01:50:50.940 --> 01:50:52.620]   It just, you know, came back to what you were saying
[01:50:52.620 --> 01:50:56.340]   earlier in the day, it just seems a little bit weird
[01:50:56.340 --> 01:50:59.660]   to on a display that's this expensive
[01:50:59.660 --> 01:51:04.340]   that has so much power and so much storage beyond
[01:51:04.340 --> 01:51:07.660]   what a TV screen needs to have,
[01:51:07.660 --> 01:51:09.700]   why not put Wi-Fi into it?
[01:51:09.700 --> 01:51:11.820]   Why not put Bluetooth into it?
[01:51:11.820 --> 01:51:13.860]   And I mean, already people are speculating
[01:51:13.860 --> 01:51:16.540]   with the 64 gigs of storage or four.
[01:51:16.540 --> 01:51:19.260]   Why are you gonna like suddenly create a bigger mystery
[01:51:19.260 --> 01:51:20.620]   by saying it also happens?
[01:51:20.620 --> 01:51:23.740]   If anything, it would like maybe quash rumors
[01:51:23.740 --> 01:51:25.420]   'cause they're, oh well no, they, oh clearly
[01:51:25.420 --> 01:51:28.860]   they just had like all these chips left over,
[01:51:28.860 --> 01:51:30.940]   they may as well put them in there.
[01:51:30.940 --> 01:51:34.820]   It's easier to basically put all this entire platform
[01:51:34.820 --> 01:51:37.860]   in there as one rather than to delete hardware
[01:51:37.860 --> 01:51:40.900]   that maybe this chip is expecting to be interface to.
[01:51:40.900 --> 01:51:43.580]   But because boy, would that be interesting
[01:51:43.580 --> 01:51:44.740]   if those radios were there?
[01:51:44.740 --> 01:51:46.060]   - What I was telling is like they were just,
[01:51:46.060 --> 01:51:47.980]   they were just stuck at home and they started to understand
[01:51:47.980 --> 01:51:50.460]   why so many of us were complaining about the LG display
[01:51:50.460 --> 01:51:52.580]   because they weren't at work with all their big iMacs
[01:51:52.580 --> 01:51:55.140]   and everything and they wanted to get back into displays.
[01:51:55.140 --> 01:51:57.020]   But you have to say you're gonna differentiate it
[01:51:57.020 --> 01:51:58.940]   and they're like, you will do the Apple Silicon stuff.
[01:51:58.940 --> 01:52:00.940]   We'll make it do all the stuff that the MacBook displays
[01:52:00.940 --> 01:52:01.780]   have been doing.
[01:52:01.780 --> 01:52:02.820]   And then it was just like you said,
[01:52:02.820 --> 01:52:05.100]   it was cheaper at scale to just throw
[01:52:05.100 --> 01:52:07.340]   basically iPad nine parts in there
[01:52:07.340 --> 01:52:08.740]   'cause those are on the previous legacy,
[01:52:08.740 --> 01:52:09.860]   like the previous node.
[01:52:09.860 --> 01:52:11.540]   So there's no constraint on those
[01:52:11.540 --> 01:52:13.980]   and they could just ship it.
[01:52:13.980 --> 01:52:16.420]   - One of the reasons is so thick as it has
[01:52:16.420 --> 01:52:18.580]   this power supply built in, we've talked about that,
[01:52:18.580 --> 01:52:20.540]   there's no brick, it's inside.
[01:52:20.540 --> 01:52:24.860]   And I fix it was kind of blown away by the power supply.
[01:52:24.860 --> 01:52:26.940]   They said, first of all, that's the reason
[01:52:26.940 --> 01:52:29.220]   you've got these big fans because the power supply
[01:52:29.220 --> 01:52:31.620]   generates a lot more heat than the A13.
[01:52:31.620 --> 01:52:35.180]   But also they were impressed that there are cutouts
[01:52:35.180 --> 01:52:36.980]   for the capacitors.
[01:52:36.980 --> 01:52:39.220]   They said, we've never seen this before,
[01:52:39.220 --> 01:52:41.260]   Apple never does it the easy way.
[01:52:41.260 --> 01:52:44.220]   It's a huge amount of engineering effort and cost
[01:52:44.220 --> 01:52:47.580]   to design a slim power supply like this.
[01:52:47.580 --> 01:52:50.660]   It's actually a two-parter and you could see
[01:52:50.660 --> 01:52:55.660]   the capacitors are kind of set into the board itself
[01:52:55.660 --> 01:52:57.780]   which is kind of wild.
[01:52:57.780 --> 01:52:59.300]   So this explains by the way,
[01:52:59.300 --> 01:53:02.140]   why the studio display is thicker than the iMac.
[01:53:02.140 --> 01:53:05.020]   I fix it, said if they've gone with an external power supply,
[01:53:05.020 --> 01:53:07.220]   it would have been the same same as the iMac
[01:53:07.220 --> 01:53:09.260]   and you wouldn't have to have all these fans and everything.
[01:53:09.260 --> 01:53:10.780]   It's very interesting.
[01:53:10.780 --> 01:53:13.460]   - And we thought it got MagSafe, Jackalope product.
[01:53:13.460 --> 01:53:18.460]   But yeah, you know, Apple had some time on their hands
[01:53:18.460 --> 01:53:22.540]   designed the display that's secretly an iMac.
[01:53:22.540 --> 01:53:24.820]   - Mark Edwards of Bajango has a wonderful article
[01:53:24.820 --> 01:53:29.740]   about why the 5K at 2X, like perfect retina,
[01:53:29.740 --> 01:53:31.940]   like native resolution is so important
[01:53:31.940 --> 01:53:33.140]   to designers and developers.
[01:53:33.140 --> 01:53:35.100]   And he had, of course, you made all the nerdy grids
[01:53:35.100 --> 01:53:36.420]   and showed you all the different
[01:53:36.420 --> 01:53:38.540]   where pixels fall on those grids.
[01:53:38.540 --> 01:53:40.860]   But there's a lot of very, very happy developers
[01:53:40.860 --> 01:53:43.020]   and designers who don't have to make their eyes bleed
[01:53:43.020 --> 01:53:45.220]   anymore by pixel scaling.
[01:53:45.220 --> 01:53:47.540]   - It's running at 38.40 by 2160.
[01:53:47.540 --> 01:53:50.420]   So it's exactly 2X 1080p.
[01:53:50.420 --> 01:53:54.820]   Oh, wait a minute, that's the 4K.
[01:53:54.820 --> 01:53:59.540]   - It's 2X the, it's 2X the basic 27 inch original iMac.
[01:53:59.540 --> 01:54:01.700]   It's a retina, perfect retina.
[01:54:01.700 --> 01:54:03.100]   - Perfect retina, okay.
[01:54:03.100 --> 01:54:08.580]   It's 186 PPI, the ideal Mac display PPI for desktops
[01:54:08.580 --> 01:54:09.500]   is 220.
[01:54:09.500 --> 01:54:13.780]   Interesting.
[01:54:13.780 --> 01:54:15.460]   I will read this.
[01:54:15.460 --> 01:54:16.300]   Thank you.
[01:54:16.300 --> 01:54:17.140]   - He's a smart man.
[01:54:17.140 --> 01:54:17.980]   - He's a smart man.
[01:54:17.980 --> 01:54:20.660]   - They do i-stat menus, which is awesome
[01:54:20.660 --> 01:54:23.020]   and snowflake, which I also paid for.
[01:54:23.020 --> 01:54:24.540]   Some awesome stuff.
[01:54:24.540 --> 01:54:26.020]   - And Scala, which he keeps teasing,
[01:54:26.020 --> 01:54:27.860]   but has not yet released, even though it's been
[01:54:27.860 --> 01:54:29.500]   - What Scala gonna be?
[01:54:29.500 --> 01:54:31.220]   - Scala's his interface designer.
[01:54:31.220 --> 01:54:32.860]   People have gotten sneak peeks of it,
[01:54:32.860 --> 01:54:35.860]   but I think it's like just next generation
[01:54:35.860 --> 01:54:37.700]   interface designer, which I'm waiting for Mark.
[01:54:37.700 --> 01:54:39.100]   Please ship that already.
[01:54:39.100 --> 01:54:41.640]   - And icon design tool.
[01:54:41.640 --> 01:54:44.300]   All right, let's take a final break
[01:54:44.300 --> 01:54:46.500]   and we'll get your picks of the week.
[01:54:46.500 --> 01:54:49.900]   If you don't mind coming up in just a second
[01:54:49.900 --> 01:54:52.500]   as we continue with Mac break weekly,
[01:54:52.500 --> 01:54:54.260]   our show today brought to you by cash flaming,
[01:54:54.260 --> 01:54:56.260]   quite literally brought to you by cash fly.
[01:54:56.260 --> 01:54:59.700]   It's our CDN, our content delivery network.
[01:54:59.700 --> 01:55:01.740]   How do we know how good cash fly is?
[01:55:01.740 --> 01:55:05.540]   We've been using them practically since the beginning.
[01:55:05.540 --> 01:55:07.820]   Early days of Twit, we were really struggling
[01:55:07.820 --> 01:55:09.980]   getting all the audio, just the audio out to you.
[01:55:09.980 --> 01:55:12.660]   And Matt Levine of cash like call and said,
[01:55:12.660 --> 01:55:13.900]   "We can help and they happen.
[01:55:13.900 --> 01:55:15.740]   "We've been using them for more than a decade."
[01:55:15.740 --> 01:55:18.860]   And when we went to video, cash fly was there.
[01:55:18.860 --> 01:55:22.100]   Now they're there for live streaming video.
[01:55:22.100 --> 01:55:23.940]   This is amazing.
[01:55:23.940 --> 01:55:26.580]   They're ultra low latency video streamings.
[01:55:26.580 --> 01:55:28.620]   Now I'm not talking web RTC.
[01:55:28.620 --> 01:55:32.020]   You can ditch that for their web socket,
[01:55:32.020 --> 01:55:33.220]   live video workflow.
[01:55:33.220 --> 01:55:38.220]   It scales to millions of users with sub one second latency.
[01:55:38.220 --> 01:55:41.860]   And you can get up and running in hours, not days.
[01:55:41.860 --> 01:55:44.900]   50 locations, 50 pops points of presence around the globe
[01:55:44.900 --> 01:55:47.060]   means your content will always be delivered
[01:55:47.060 --> 01:55:50.220]   closer to your customers outperforming local CDNs.
[01:55:50.220 --> 01:55:51.060]   We know that.
[01:55:51.060 --> 01:55:52.580]   That's one of the reasons we use cash fly
[01:55:52.580 --> 01:55:55.340]   so that no matter where in the world you're downloading
[01:55:55.340 --> 01:55:59.500]   our shows, you get them faster with no buffering.
[01:55:59.500 --> 01:56:02.340]   And it's great for us because we have for a long time
[01:56:02.340 --> 01:56:04.540]   been using what has now become cash fly storage
[01:56:04.540 --> 01:56:08.340]   optimization system, which means they host the content.
[01:56:08.340 --> 01:56:09.980]   It takes a load off your origin servers,
[01:56:09.980 --> 01:56:13.220]   reduces your S three bills, your bandwidth,
[01:56:13.220 --> 01:56:17.220]   and increases your cash hit ratio to 100%,
[01:56:17.220 --> 01:56:19.260]   which is a big deal.
[01:56:19.260 --> 01:56:20.580]   Cash fly is amazing.
[01:56:20.580 --> 01:56:21.700]   Make sure when you talk to them,
[01:56:21.700 --> 01:56:23.980]   you talk about their elite managed packages too.
[01:56:23.980 --> 01:56:26.860]   You get VIP treatment 24/7 support,
[01:56:26.860 --> 01:56:29.380]   response times in less than an hour.
[01:56:29.380 --> 01:56:31.860]   In most cases, if you send them a ticket,
[01:56:31.860 --> 01:56:32.940]   they'll say, we're working on it.
[01:56:32.940 --> 01:56:34.220]   It's almost fixed.
[01:56:34.220 --> 01:56:37.260]   They're really, really good.
[01:56:37.260 --> 01:56:39.820]   I love cash fly, you will too.
[01:56:39.820 --> 01:56:41.780]   10 times faster than traditional methods.
[01:56:41.780 --> 01:56:43.020]   I'll vouch for that.
[01:56:43.020 --> 01:56:47.780]   On six continents, they have a 98% cash hit ratio
[01:56:47.780 --> 01:56:51.260]   and availability over the last 12 months, 100%,
[01:56:51.260 --> 01:56:56.260]   100%, plus 365 day a year 24/7 priority support.
[01:56:56.260 --> 01:56:57.220]   They're there when you need them.
[01:56:57.220 --> 01:56:58.540]   We love cash fly.
[01:56:58.540 --> 01:57:01.620]   Cash fly is giving away a complimentary detailed analysis
[01:57:01.620 --> 01:57:04.260]   of your current CDN bill and usage trends.
[01:57:04.260 --> 01:57:06.740]   See if you're overpaying 20% or more.
[01:57:06.740 --> 01:57:09.620]   twit.cash fly.com.
[01:57:09.620 --> 01:57:13.380]   Twit.cash fly.com, no sales pressure,
[01:57:13.380 --> 01:57:16.660]   just information, you owe it to yourself
[01:57:16.660 --> 01:57:18.940]   to find out what cash fly can do for you.
[01:57:18.940 --> 01:57:20.220]   It's sure done a lot for us.
[01:57:20.220 --> 01:57:23.860]   Twit.cash fly.com.
[01:57:23.860 --> 01:57:25.060]   Thank you, cash fly.
[01:57:25.060 --> 01:57:29.380]   Okay, Renee Richie, big of the week.
[01:57:29.380 --> 01:57:31.020]   So I've got two, I had one pick,
[01:57:31.020 --> 01:57:32.660]   but then I just saw the,
[01:57:32.660 --> 01:57:35.020]   Picard season two is not even finished yet
[01:57:35.020 --> 01:57:36.100]   and there's a trailer that just came out
[01:57:36.100 --> 01:57:37.540]   for Picard season three.
[01:57:37.540 --> 01:57:39.940]   And if you're not following this,
[01:57:39.940 --> 01:57:42.940]   Paramount remembered that they had a Star Trek property
[01:57:42.940 --> 01:57:45.020]   and decided to actually start making shows again.
[01:57:45.020 --> 01:57:46.940]   So now there's like a billion of them on TV.
[01:57:46.940 --> 01:57:48.060]   Yeah, there's more than just Picard.
[01:57:48.060 --> 01:57:49.220]   There's more Star Trek coming.
[01:57:49.220 --> 01:57:51.500]   Yeah, there's discoveries on season,
[01:57:51.500 --> 01:57:52.980]   just finished season four,
[01:57:52.980 --> 01:57:54.660]   a strange new worlds,
[01:57:54.660 --> 01:57:56.380]   which is about the Captain Pike Enterprise
[01:57:56.380 --> 01:57:57.220]   is about to come out.
[01:57:57.220 --> 01:57:58.060]   Oh, that's the one I want to see.
[01:57:58.060 --> 01:57:58.900]   Two or three animated shows.
[01:57:58.900 --> 01:57:59.740]   Yeah, wow.
[01:57:59.740 --> 01:58:00.580]   Yeah.
[01:58:00.580 --> 01:58:02.900]   And universally, they're gorgeous.
[01:58:02.900 --> 01:58:05.140]   Like the effects work, the sound design,
[01:58:05.140 --> 01:58:08.100]   the cinematography are remarkable.
[01:58:08.100 --> 01:58:10.100]   Some of them lose showrunners faster
[01:58:10.100 --> 01:58:12.740]   than the plot lines in the original next generation.
[01:58:12.740 --> 01:58:14.300]   And so they're incredibly,
[01:58:14.300 --> 01:58:15.700]   like things happen that they forget about
[01:58:15.700 --> 01:58:17.300]   in the same episode sometimes,
[01:58:17.300 --> 01:58:18.860]   but they're starting to get their act together.
[01:58:18.860 --> 01:58:21.420]   The last few seasons have been much more solid
[01:58:21.420 --> 01:58:23.820]   and they're starting to bring all that together.
[01:58:23.820 --> 01:58:27.140]   And they announced a final season of Picard season three
[01:58:27.140 --> 01:58:28.980]   and the trailer just dropped.
[01:58:28.980 --> 01:58:31.940]   And the basic thing is if you loved the next generation
[01:58:31.940 --> 01:58:34.780]   and you wanted to see where that crew was now,
[01:58:34.780 --> 01:58:38.620]   they are going to go all out and bring the entire,
[01:58:38.620 --> 01:58:40.460]   it looks like the entire crew back.
[01:58:40.460 --> 01:58:41.300]   Oh, wow.
[01:58:41.300 --> 01:58:42.140]   Oh, wow.
[01:58:42.140 --> 01:58:42.980]   Four seasons and three.
[01:58:42.980 --> 01:58:45.020]   So you'll have, you know, Wharf and Data and Geordie
[01:58:45.020 --> 01:58:45.860]   and...
[01:58:45.860 --> 01:58:48.820]   Wesley, Wesley, Wesley, Wesley, Wesley.
[01:58:48.820 --> 01:58:50.140]   We haven't seen Wesley yet.
[01:58:50.140 --> 01:58:51.180]   Maybe he's a surprise.
[01:58:51.180 --> 01:58:52.260]   We know how you can get him.
[01:58:52.260 --> 01:58:53.860]   Get a hold of him if you need to.
[01:58:53.860 --> 01:58:55.180]   (laughs)
[01:58:55.180 --> 01:58:57.180]   Yeah, he's busy on, you know, on SWAT,
[01:58:57.180 --> 01:58:58.820]   I think he's busy on the SWAT show right now.
[01:58:58.820 --> 01:59:01.020]   Oh, okay, maybe that's the problem.
[01:59:01.020 --> 01:59:01.860]   All right.
[01:59:01.860 --> 01:59:05.860]   So the other pick is, so I've had the Canon EOS R5.
[01:59:05.860 --> 01:59:06.860]   Oops, upside down.
[01:59:06.860 --> 01:59:08.380]   EOS R5 for a while.
[01:59:08.380 --> 01:59:09.900]   And it's a really great camera.
[01:59:09.900 --> 01:59:12.540]   It does 8K, it does...
[01:59:12.540 --> 01:59:14.380]   It does really, really wonderful video,
[01:59:14.380 --> 01:59:18.420]   but it is so hot that it just breaks down after a while.
[01:59:18.420 --> 01:59:20.540]   It turns itself off, it reaches thermal limit.
[01:59:20.540 --> 01:59:23.460]   And Canon still insists on sabotaging their non-cinema
[01:59:23.460 --> 01:59:25.340]   cameras with 30-minute record limits.
[01:59:25.340 --> 01:59:29.260]   For no apparent reason but to sabotage their non-cinema line.
[01:59:29.260 --> 01:59:34.260]   So they announced a EOS R5C recently.
[01:59:34.260 --> 01:59:38.500]   And as far as I can tell, this is exactly the EOS R5,
[01:59:38.500 --> 01:59:41.260]   but it has a huge honking fan on the back.
[01:59:41.260 --> 01:59:44.660]   Like just, it's been like extruded a good inch away
[01:59:44.660 --> 01:59:47.540]   from the body so that it can sustain recording
[01:59:47.540 --> 01:59:50.220]   for more than just 30 minutes.
[01:59:50.220 --> 01:59:51.540]   And it was a real problem for me.
[01:59:51.540 --> 01:59:54.900]   I love Canon's color, I love the image quality,
[01:59:54.900 --> 01:59:56.380]   I love everything about it.
[01:59:56.380 --> 01:59:58.620]   But it was stopping when I was trying to record things
[01:59:58.620 --> 02:00:01.060]   like unboxings and it'd be super inconvenient
[02:00:01.060 --> 02:00:03.140]   in the middle of unboxing to see the 30 minutes hit
[02:00:03.140 --> 02:00:05.140]   and I'd have to get up and restart everything.
[02:00:05.140 --> 02:00:09.020]   So hopefully now this solves those problems.
[02:00:09.020 --> 02:00:11.740]   There's still issues where Canon puts like some cameras
[02:00:11.740 --> 02:00:14.460]   get raw and some get 10-bit and some get,
[02:00:14.460 --> 02:00:18.580]   and some get like the, I'm blanking on the name,
[02:00:18.580 --> 02:00:23.220]   the Canon for C log.
[02:00:23.220 --> 02:00:26.220]   Some get C log three, some get C log two, it's maddening.
[02:00:26.220 --> 02:00:29.660]   But I'm shooting all with Canon's and they're,
[02:00:29.660 --> 02:00:31.820]   they're getting a lot of competition from Sony.
[02:00:31.820 --> 02:00:34.020]   So it's nice to see, they're starting to wake up
[02:00:34.020 --> 02:00:35.980]   and actually offer slightly better cameras
[02:00:35.980 --> 02:00:38.660]   for those of us who are, who have so much Canon glasses.
[02:00:38.660 --> 02:00:40.700]   It's just not feasible to switch.
[02:00:40.700 --> 02:00:41.740]   - I don't know if it's still the case,
[02:00:41.740 --> 02:00:44.260]   but one of the reasons that that was,
[02:00:44.260 --> 02:00:45.700]   there was a limit on the Canon cameras
[02:00:45.700 --> 02:00:48.180]   was because of European taxes.
[02:00:48.180 --> 02:00:49.020]   - For taxes, yeah.
[02:00:49.020 --> 02:00:51.620]   - So yeah, so the print, if you were still,
[02:00:51.620 --> 02:00:54.580]   it was one tack which much lower than if it was video.
[02:00:54.580 --> 02:00:56.820]   And so that was, for a long time, I don't know if that's still
[02:00:56.820 --> 02:00:59.620]   an issue, but I know that a Canon was careful not to do that.
[02:00:59.620 --> 02:01:02.540]   And at one period of time, there was a hack
[02:01:02.540 --> 02:01:06.060]   that they didn't look like they worked too hard to stop.
[02:01:06.060 --> 02:01:09.380]   - Imagine a lantern in a room where, yeah.
[02:01:09.380 --> 02:01:11.220]   It's great, but Sony ignored it,
[02:01:11.220 --> 02:01:13.260]   started just ignoring it and making their cameras record
[02:01:13.260 --> 02:01:15.900]   anyway and I wish the Canon would follow there.
[02:01:15.900 --> 02:01:18.420]   They're much better for a user side lead.
[02:01:18.420 --> 02:01:21.940]   But anyways, it's a great camera, I'm really happy with it.
[02:01:21.940 --> 02:01:25.180]   - He, Salt Hank uses in our six,
[02:01:25.180 --> 02:01:27.580]   but remember TikTok videos, you don't have to record
[02:01:27.580 --> 02:01:28.740]   for 30 minutes.
[02:01:28.740 --> 02:01:30.060]   (laughing)
[02:01:30.060 --> 02:01:31.140]   - And you may not need 8K,
[02:01:31.140 --> 02:01:32.500]   like I think the big differentiator is like,
[02:01:32.500 --> 02:01:35.060]   it's actually a better camera if you don't need 8K
[02:01:35.060 --> 02:01:36.700]   or you don't need 4K raw.
[02:01:36.700 --> 02:01:40.540]   - He's starting to do YouTube videos now.
[02:01:40.540 --> 02:01:43.940]   So I don't know what, I don't mean,
[02:01:43.940 --> 02:01:44.980]   I might have to upgrade him.
[02:01:44.980 --> 02:01:46.580]   I did order, don't tell him,
[02:01:46.580 --> 02:01:48.340]   but I did our Mac Studio Ultra form
[02:01:48.340 --> 02:01:49.660]   'cause he really needs that for his editor.
[02:01:49.660 --> 02:01:50.500]   - Nice.
[02:01:50.500 --> 02:01:51.740]   - I think.
[02:01:51.740 --> 02:01:54.700]   - Mr. Alex, Lindsey, your pick of the week.
[02:01:54.700 --> 02:01:56.220]   - I've talked about it, I think in the past,
[02:01:56.220 --> 02:01:58.140]   but it's just such a great little piece of hardware.
[02:01:58.140 --> 02:01:59.780]   I'm recommending MakerBit.
[02:01:59.780 --> 02:02:04.780]   So MakerBit is the micro bit,
[02:02:04.780 --> 02:02:06.860]   it's a add-on to the micro bit.
[02:02:06.860 --> 02:02:08.460]   So the micro bit is something the BBC worked on
[02:02:08.460 --> 02:02:09.980]   to teach kids how to do.
[02:02:09.980 --> 02:02:12.100]   It's got a bunch of stuff that's all built into it.
[02:02:12.100 --> 02:02:14.860]   And so the thing is,
[02:02:14.860 --> 02:02:17.140]   is that it's really good by itself,
[02:02:17.140 --> 02:02:19.540]   but it's really hard to use all the pin outs
[02:02:19.540 --> 02:02:22.260]   because they're just like an insert.
[02:02:22.260 --> 02:02:24.820]   They kind of assume that most kids won't use it,
[02:02:24.820 --> 02:02:27.500]   but they were like, yeah, we'll put it in there anyway.
[02:02:27.500 --> 02:02:29.500]   And so they put it in Roger Wagner,
[02:02:29.500 --> 02:02:30.500]   who used to work at Apple,
[02:02:30.500 --> 02:02:33.780]   and has done tons and tons of incredible work,
[02:02:33.780 --> 02:02:36.300]   built this thing that basically takes the little pin outs,
[02:02:36.300 --> 02:02:39.940]   takes the slide in pin outs and just exposes all the power
[02:02:39.940 --> 02:02:41.380]   that it has.
[02:02:41.380 --> 02:02:43.060]   And so you can add lots of things that are easier.
[02:02:43.060 --> 02:02:44.540]   It's very close to an Android.
[02:02:44.540 --> 02:02:45.660]   The one difference is,
[02:02:45.660 --> 02:02:48.540]   is that it allows you to use some of the programming
[02:02:48.540 --> 02:02:50.100]   that's visual to it.
[02:02:50.100 --> 02:02:53.380]   And so you can actually put these things together.
[02:02:53.380 --> 02:02:55.820]   And he's been working with us to do tutorials.
[02:02:55.820 --> 02:02:57.380]   I think I might have shown this was.
[02:02:57.380 --> 02:03:03.020]   - We have this box that I actually spilled some stuff on.
[02:03:03.020 --> 02:03:05.340]   - Well, it's a pizza box, it's appropriate.
[02:03:05.340 --> 02:03:06.180]   - The pizza box,
[02:03:06.180 --> 02:03:08.820]   and we were learning how to program it all,
[02:03:08.820 --> 02:03:10.380]   and we're all doing it together.
[02:03:10.380 --> 02:03:13.580]   And it's just a great,
[02:03:13.580 --> 02:03:16.220]   it's not very expensive and he's amazing.
[02:03:16.220 --> 02:03:17.940]   And we're gonna be doing more of this stuff with him,
[02:03:17.940 --> 02:03:22.500]   but it's just a, it's a great little kind of geeky little box.
[02:03:22.500 --> 02:03:25.380]   The maker bit itself is just this little guy.
[02:03:25.380 --> 02:03:26.220]   - Oh, look it.
[02:03:26.220 --> 02:03:29.220]   - And I thought, so what he builds is the part
[02:03:29.220 --> 02:03:30.780]   that you slide the maker bit into,
[02:03:30.780 --> 02:03:31.980]   that makes it easy to,
[02:03:31.980 --> 02:03:33.140]   'cause otherwise you have to figure out
[02:03:33.140 --> 02:03:34.580]   how to connect to these little things,
[02:03:34.580 --> 02:03:35.900]   which is a lot harder.
[02:03:35.900 --> 02:03:38.100]   But it has a lot of the tools.
[02:03:38.100 --> 02:03:40.860]   Again, it has a lot of bits and pieces that you can use.
[02:03:40.860 --> 02:03:42.020]   And it was built for education,
[02:03:42.020 --> 02:03:44.140]   but it's talking to some friends and they're like,
[02:03:44.140 --> 02:03:44.980]   "Yeah, we use those."
[02:03:44.980 --> 02:03:45.820]   And I was like, "You really use them?"
[02:03:45.820 --> 02:03:46.660]   I thought they were for education.
[02:03:46.660 --> 02:03:48.540]   "Well, they're pretty useful."
[02:03:48.540 --> 02:03:49.780]   We use them in a lot of places.
[02:03:49.780 --> 02:03:51.140]   They're easy to buy and bulk.
[02:03:51.140 --> 02:03:55.820]   So anyway, so I think that pretty slick little,
[02:03:55.820 --> 02:04:00.580]   the maker bits themselves and also the micro bits themselves
[02:04:00.580 --> 02:04:02.820]   in the maker bit is slick.
[02:04:02.820 --> 02:04:03.980]   It's my pick.
[02:04:03.980 --> 02:04:06.660]   - So, but you can't, it needs something on top of it?
[02:04:06.660 --> 02:04:08.300]   Or it's a hat?
[02:04:08.300 --> 02:04:09.780]   - Yeah, no, so the maker bit,
[02:04:09.780 --> 02:04:11.860]   the maker bit is something you'd buy separately.
[02:04:11.860 --> 02:04:14.460]   The maker, I mean, I'm sorry, the micro bit,
[02:04:14.460 --> 02:04:15.300]   this is the micro bit.
[02:04:15.300 --> 02:04:16.140]   - So you have a micro bit
[02:04:16.140 --> 02:04:18.380]   and then you put the maker bit on top of it as a hat.
[02:04:18.380 --> 02:04:19.940]   - You slide this into the maker bit.
[02:04:19.940 --> 02:04:20.860]   - Oh, you slide it, okay.
[02:04:20.860 --> 02:04:22.660]   - So think the micro bit, you slide into the maker bit
[02:04:22.660 --> 02:04:24.660]   and suddenly now all the wiring,
[02:04:24.660 --> 02:04:25.500]   you can pop everything.
[02:04:25.500 --> 02:04:28.340]   It's much more like this is something for kids to learn.
[02:04:28.340 --> 02:04:31.940]   When you add that, it becomes basically an Arduino board.
[02:04:31.940 --> 02:04:32.780]   - I like it.
[02:04:32.780 --> 02:04:34.300]   - The demo is on the maker bit site.
[02:04:34.300 --> 02:04:35.420]   I mean, it looks like you could, you know,
[02:04:35.420 --> 02:04:37.180]   all sorts of uses for kids, actually.
[02:04:37.180 --> 02:04:40.380]   - Well, he is, and again, kids of all ages.
[02:04:40.380 --> 02:04:43.740]   Like we're learning it, it's super useful,
[02:04:43.740 --> 02:04:47.180]   it's powerful and I think that it's definitely worth,
[02:04:47.180 --> 02:04:48.620]   worth checking out even if you're not a kid.
[02:04:48.620 --> 02:04:49.460]   - Nice.
[02:04:49.460 --> 02:04:50.300]   - So it's got some good stuff on it.
[02:04:50.300 --> 02:04:51.460]   - Very nice.
[02:04:51.460 --> 02:04:53.620]   Andy and I co-pick of the week.
[02:04:53.620 --> 02:04:57.380]   - Oh boy, am I so happy to, for this pick of the week.
[02:04:57.380 --> 02:05:00.500]   Audio hijack when the greatest Mac app's ever
[02:05:00.500 --> 02:05:03.540]   has just been updated to version four
[02:05:03.540 --> 02:05:06.780]   and it is everything I love to see in an app.
[02:05:06.780 --> 02:05:08.060]   It is, what does it do?
[02:05:08.060 --> 02:05:10.260]   It records audio on your Mac.
[02:05:10.260 --> 02:05:11.900]   Well, what kind of audio?
[02:05:11.900 --> 02:05:13.660]   Any audio, in any combination,
[02:05:13.660 --> 02:05:15.180]   no matter what you wanna do with it.
[02:05:15.180 --> 02:05:17.540]   So if all you want to do is,
[02:05:17.540 --> 02:05:20.620]   oh, there's a concert that's streaming on this website.
[02:05:20.620 --> 02:05:21.980]   Wanna catch the audio?
[02:05:21.980 --> 02:05:23.140]   Great, it'll do that.
[02:05:23.140 --> 02:05:25.180]   You want to record from a microphone
[02:05:25.180 --> 02:05:27.340]   that's plugged into your Mac, it'll do that.
[02:05:27.340 --> 02:05:30.180]   But the thing is, it is so flexible.
[02:05:30.180 --> 02:05:32.980]   It is, again, it'll do anything you want to do
[02:05:32.980 --> 02:05:35.580]   regarding capturing and recording audio.
[02:05:35.580 --> 02:05:39.780]   As you grow into it, really, you figure out,
[02:05:39.780 --> 02:05:43.540]   you smack your head because either you stop,
[02:05:43.540 --> 02:05:46.780]   you spent like three weeks or three months
[02:05:46.780 --> 02:05:48.740]   into your podcast wondering,
[02:05:48.740 --> 02:05:50.020]   oh man, I really wish I could do,
[02:05:50.020 --> 02:05:52.020]   I didn't have to do this, this, this, and this.
[02:05:52.020 --> 02:05:54.060]   Well, you don't because you have audio hijack.
[02:05:54.060 --> 02:05:56.180]   You have all these little modules that are like Legos
[02:05:56.180 --> 02:06:00.300]   that you just simply drag from this tool tray
[02:06:00.300 --> 02:06:02.100]   that basically tells audio hijack
[02:06:02.100 --> 02:06:04.780]   where you want to capture sources from,
[02:06:04.780 --> 02:06:08.300]   what you want to do with that along the way,
[02:06:08.300 --> 02:06:11.660]   whether it's changing the tone, compressing it,
[02:06:11.660 --> 02:06:15.380]   adjusting the volume, how you want to record it,
[02:06:15.380 --> 02:06:17.020]   how you want to output it.
[02:06:17.020 --> 02:06:20.020]   It was when I record the material podcast
[02:06:20.020 --> 02:06:23.500]   with Florence Ion, it took me, again,
[02:06:23.500 --> 02:06:25.380]   I had one of those smack in the head moments
[02:06:25.380 --> 02:06:26.940]   when I realized that, oh, I'm making things
[02:06:26.940 --> 02:06:28.700]   way too complicated, I can just do
[02:06:28.700 --> 02:06:29.820]   with the solid audio hijack.
[02:06:29.820 --> 02:06:32.740]   So there's a saved like recording session
[02:06:32.740 --> 02:06:36.380]   that whenever I record this show,
[02:06:36.380 --> 02:06:38.620]   that will automatically record,
[02:06:38.620 --> 02:06:40.900]   create three recording simultaneously.
[02:06:40.900 --> 02:06:43.660]   One of just me, one of just flow,
[02:06:43.660 --> 02:06:46.620]   one combined where it's a stereo recording
[02:06:46.620 --> 02:06:48.700]   with flow in one channel and me and the other.
[02:06:48.700 --> 02:06:51.740]   Meanwhile, it's feeding itself into VU meters
[02:06:51.740 --> 02:06:53.460]   so I can actually see that yes,
[02:06:53.460 --> 02:06:56.300]   it is capturing audio from all these sources.
[02:06:56.300 --> 02:07:01.300]   It's capturing from microphones as well as my chat apps
[02:07:01.300 --> 02:07:04.340]   as well as I want to make sure that
[02:07:04.340 --> 02:07:05.620]   when it gets into my headphones
[02:07:05.620 --> 02:07:06.780]   and I'm listening to it,
[02:07:06.780 --> 02:07:08.900]   I don't get like reverb and feedback.
[02:07:08.900 --> 02:07:10.140]   So I've got another set of controls
[02:07:10.140 --> 02:07:11.780]   that simply allows me to adjust
[02:07:11.780 --> 02:07:15.180]   like what I'm gonna be hearing in the middle of that.
[02:07:15.180 --> 02:07:19.740]   And version four, that's like maybe on a scale,
[02:07:19.740 --> 02:07:22.820]   one to 10, that's maybe a three on how complicated
[02:07:22.820 --> 02:07:23.860]   you can make this.
[02:07:23.860 --> 02:07:26.500]   You can also again, add audio effects.
[02:07:26.500 --> 02:07:29.940]   The audio number version four adds a mixer.
[02:07:29.940 --> 02:07:30.980]   So you can have multiple,
[02:07:30.980 --> 02:07:33.300]   so if you have multiple microphones plugged in at once
[02:07:33.300 --> 02:07:35.300]   without making it complicated at all,
[02:07:35.300 --> 02:07:36.140]   you can just simply say,
[02:07:36.140 --> 02:07:37.500]   oh, by the way, here are all the inputs.
[02:07:37.500 --> 02:07:40.660]   Here's why I want the levels of each one of these things to be.
[02:07:40.660 --> 02:07:43.700]   They've also added some really good interface things.
[02:07:43.700 --> 02:07:47.140]   One thing that was a little bit of a clutch for me
[02:07:47.140 --> 02:07:49.060]   is that I like to keep,
[02:07:49.060 --> 02:07:51.260]   I use the recording timer to keep an eye
[02:07:51.260 --> 02:07:53.140]   on how long we're going on the recording.
[02:07:53.140 --> 02:07:56.340]   So I would always like keep the bottom
[02:07:56.340 --> 02:08:00.060]   of my recording window a little bit under the show doc
[02:08:00.060 --> 02:08:02.500]   so I could see like what the timer is doing
[02:08:02.500 --> 02:08:06.780]   and now they've added a menu of let's you access
[02:08:06.780 --> 02:08:07.660]   what you're recording.
[02:08:07.660 --> 02:08:10.860]   And it also will stay persistently above everything else.
[02:08:10.860 --> 02:08:13.620]   And there are a whole bunch of other features about this,
[02:08:13.620 --> 02:08:16.060]   but again, I can't recommend it highly enough
[02:08:16.060 --> 02:08:20.340]   because it's not a app that you can really grow out of.
[02:08:20.340 --> 02:08:24.540]   Particularly if you are a person like me,
[02:08:24.540 --> 02:08:27.100]   I'm not like Renee, I'm not like Alex,
[02:08:27.100 --> 02:08:28.140]   I'm not like Jason Snell.
[02:08:28.140 --> 02:08:31.700]   I don't have knowledge about being a real audio engineer
[02:08:31.700 --> 02:08:35.780]   and I don't have, if I bought the $200 really pro level tools
[02:08:35.780 --> 02:08:37.820]   for recording and mixing audio,
[02:08:37.820 --> 02:08:40.420]   I wouldn't know how to do, how to how to use it.
[02:08:40.420 --> 02:08:43.700]   However, this is beyond my skills
[02:08:43.700 --> 02:08:45.420]   and as I can increase my skills,
[02:08:45.420 --> 02:08:47.420]   it will accommodate me no matter what it is
[02:08:47.420 --> 02:08:48.860]   that I want to do.
[02:08:48.860 --> 02:08:52.260]   65 bucks is not cheap, but my goodness,
[02:08:52.260 --> 02:08:54.820]   you will not, for someone like me,
[02:08:54.820 --> 02:08:58.660]   you will spend 65 bucks and you will never have to buy
[02:08:58.660 --> 02:09:00.820]   another, oh gosh, I need to buy this other app
[02:09:00.820 --> 02:09:02.740]   or gosh, I wish I had, it doesn't do this,
[02:09:02.740 --> 02:09:03.780]   I'm gonna have to do that.
[02:09:03.780 --> 02:09:07.100]   It becomes about Google how to do this in audio hijack.
[02:09:07.100 --> 02:09:09.300]   You will find a primer on here's how you do,
[02:09:09.300 --> 02:09:10.660]   whatever it is you want to do,
[02:09:10.660 --> 02:09:12.580]   audio hijack can do it for you.
[02:09:12.580 --> 02:09:15.380]   Ties recommendation when the greatest pieces of Microsoft
[02:09:15.380 --> 02:09:17.220]   were that it's ever been written.
[02:09:17.220 --> 02:09:21.220]   - And I was talking about, I'm gonna move a couple laps
[02:09:21.220 --> 02:09:22.460]   and I'll leave the rest of them behind.
[02:09:22.460 --> 02:09:25.620]   Audio hijack's the only one that's coming with me.
[02:09:25.620 --> 02:09:29.260]   I wholeheartedly back what Andy said.
[02:09:29.260 --> 02:09:32.100]   The only recommendation that I have to add to that is
[02:09:32.100 --> 02:09:34.860]   there's a bundle with audio hijack and loopback,
[02:09:34.860 --> 02:09:36.980]   just buy it, just buy the bundle.
[02:09:36.980 --> 02:09:39.500]   Don't, don't, you're gonna pay more.
[02:09:39.500 --> 02:09:41.460]   And then you're gonna wish that you would buy the loopback
[02:09:41.460 --> 02:09:43.340]   with the audio hijack.
[02:09:43.340 --> 02:09:46.340]   So loopback is a routing system that all of us,
[02:09:46.340 --> 02:09:48.140]   not all of us, but a huge percentage of us
[02:09:48.140 --> 02:09:49.380]   and office hours use.
[02:09:49.380 --> 02:09:52.660]   So basically loopback lets you take your audio,
[02:09:52.660 --> 02:09:55.620]   all your audio inputs and you can mix and match them
[02:09:55.620 --> 02:09:59.860]   and then create virtual, basically virtual inputs
[02:09:59.860 --> 02:10:00.700]   for your other apps.
[02:10:00.700 --> 02:10:03.420]   So if we wanna route something really complex into Zoom,
[02:10:03.420 --> 02:10:05.300]   which is what we use it for,
[02:10:05.300 --> 02:10:07.900]   we route all of those through loopback
[02:10:07.900 --> 02:10:10.900]   and then it just shows up as the Uber,
[02:10:10.900 --> 02:10:13.100]   whatever, Uber audio input.
[02:10:13.100 --> 02:10:14.820]   Now we can go and we can turn things on and off,
[02:10:14.820 --> 02:10:16.980]   we can mix and match things that are going into Zoom.
[02:10:16.980 --> 02:10:20.140]   And so Zoom just sees this loopback solution,
[02:10:20.140 --> 02:10:22.220]   but the loopback solution can,
[02:10:22.220 --> 02:10:25.300]   we can also use that in conjunction with audio hijack.
[02:10:25.300 --> 02:10:29.740]   And so like for many, for probably a year and a half,
[02:10:29.740 --> 02:10:32.340]   maybe even now, I have to say, I've handed that off.
[02:10:32.340 --> 02:10:34.540]   And so we were stream using audio,
[02:10:34.540 --> 02:10:36.740]   not only does audio hijack do all these cool things
[02:10:36.740 --> 02:10:38.460]   and build it all out, but it also,
[02:10:38.460 --> 02:10:41.540]   we can stream to SoundCloud or stream to a nice server,
[02:10:41.540 --> 02:10:42.380]   for the audio.
[02:10:42.380 --> 02:10:44.180]   So you can literally, that's how we were streaming
[02:10:44.180 --> 02:10:48.140]   the audio version of, was using audio hijack.
[02:10:48.140 --> 02:10:50.580]   And then you can do, you can put compressors in,
[02:10:50.580 --> 02:10:52.620]   it'll take all kinds of filters.
[02:10:52.620 --> 02:10:56.260]   So you can use audio hijack to use audio,
[02:10:56.260 --> 02:10:57.700]   standard audio filters.
[02:10:57.700 --> 02:11:00.460]   So it's kind of one of those.
[02:11:00.460 --> 02:11:02.540]   If you're doing anything with audio and video,
[02:11:02.540 --> 02:11:04.180]   it's a must have.
[02:11:04.180 --> 02:11:06.900]   And so I've definitely, everything that Andy said,
[02:11:06.900 --> 02:11:08.660]   plus you just go ahead and loop back
[02:11:08.660 --> 02:11:10.380]   'cause you'll eventually wish you did.
[02:11:10.380 --> 02:11:12.940]   - You probably just buy the whole darn bundle
[02:11:12.940 --> 02:11:14.180]   and get everything you'd make
[02:11:14.180 --> 02:11:15.420]   'cause they're really an amazing.
[02:11:15.420 --> 02:11:16.860]   - Look at me, just for just, just for just,
[02:11:16.860 --> 02:11:18.140]   just for not going near the company though.
[02:11:18.140 --> 02:11:20.780]   Like be the company alone, but buy the products.
[02:11:20.780 --> 02:11:22.540]   - Yeah, they're all a number.
[02:11:22.540 --> 02:11:23.540]   - They need them on. - They're amazing.
[02:11:23.540 --> 02:11:24.940]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[02:11:24.940 --> 02:11:27.300]   - I just want to put money in a box and mail it to them.
[02:11:27.300 --> 02:11:28.860]   They're the level of quality
[02:11:28.860 --> 02:11:30.980]   and their level of creativity is just so,
[02:11:30.980 --> 02:11:31.820]   it's such a high level.
[02:11:31.820 --> 02:11:34.180]   - Andy, I don't mean this to sound at all obscene,
[02:11:34.180 --> 02:11:36.060]   but you live close enough where I could give you some money,
[02:11:36.060 --> 02:11:37.980]   you can go stuff it in their pants for all of us.
[02:11:37.980 --> 02:11:39.740]   (laughing)
[02:11:39.740 --> 02:11:40.580]   I want to do that every day.
[02:11:40.580 --> 02:11:43.940]   - Well, again, it depends on how well they dance.
[02:11:43.940 --> 02:11:45.340]   You know, I might just not give you.
[02:11:45.340 --> 02:11:46.860]   (laughing)
[02:11:46.860 --> 02:11:48.900]   - It's funny 'cause they used to make me happy.
[02:11:48.900 --> 02:11:49.740]   I'll make it a ring.
[02:11:49.740 --> 02:11:50.820]   - I used to use all of these tools,
[02:11:50.820 --> 02:11:54.020]   but now I just kind of let somebody else do all the work.
[02:11:54.020 --> 02:11:55.540]   - They're incredible.
[02:11:55.540 --> 02:11:57.980]   - I don't even know how they do it anymore.
[02:11:57.980 --> 02:11:59.700]   I do have an input for you though,
[02:11:59.700 --> 02:12:02.500]   for your loopback and audio hijack.
[02:12:02.500 --> 02:12:05.220]   We always are looking at USB interfaces
[02:12:05.220 --> 02:12:08.620]   for high quality microphones like our Hyle PR40.
[02:12:08.620 --> 02:12:11.940]   Elgato, which for a long time was just a video company.
[02:12:11.940 --> 02:12:15.820]   They got sold in 2018 to Corsair and Corsair Gaming Products.
[02:12:15.820 --> 02:12:17.940]   Now Elgato does just a ton of stuff
[02:12:17.940 --> 02:12:20.340]   for people like Renee, just YouTube streamers.
[02:12:20.340 --> 02:12:21.860]   - It's a streamer gear.
[02:12:21.860 --> 02:12:24.060]   - And we just bought, I was looking for,
[02:12:24.060 --> 02:12:25.900]   this is the Wave XLR.
[02:12:25.900 --> 02:12:29.740]   This is a USB interface that has a lot of features.
[02:12:29.740 --> 02:12:30.580]   I really like it.
[02:12:30.580 --> 02:12:31.420]   We're gonna test it out.
[02:12:31.420 --> 02:12:34.220]   We might be sending this out instead of the Scarlet
[02:12:34.220 --> 02:12:35.860]   to our hosts.
[02:12:35.860 --> 02:12:38.740]   It supports Phantom power.
[02:12:38.740 --> 02:12:39.780]   So it'll work with Hiles,
[02:12:39.780 --> 02:12:41.860]   which don't require any or condenser mics.
[02:12:41.860 --> 02:12:46.300]   Has a headphone jack powered by USB Type-C.
[02:12:46.300 --> 02:12:48.500]   But what I love about it's got a big knob.
[02:12:48.500 --> 02:12:50.700]   So one of the problems we often have
[02:12:50.700 --> 02:12:53.780]   with our hosts who are using scarlets is we say,
[02:12:53.780 --> 02:12:55.340]   "Well, turn your microphone up."
[02:12:55.340 --> 02:12:56.780]   And then they don't know.
[02:12:56.780 --> 02:12:59.140]   So this knob will either turn up the mic,
[02:12:59.140 --> 02:13:01.740]   the headphones or we'll do a mixing thing.
[02:13:01.740 --> 02:13:03.860]   Just you press it to change that.
[02:13:03.860 --> 02:13:06.380]   You've pressed long press to get 48 volts.
[02:13:06.380 --> 02:13:08.220]   It even has a cough drop built in.
[02:13:08.220 --> 02:13:10.300]   It's got a capacitive button.
[02:13:10.300 --> 02:13:13.060]   You just tap it, mutes it, which is really great.
[02:13:13.060 --> 02:13:15.620]   So this is a USB interface
[02:13:15.620 --> 02:13:18.460]   for professional quality microphones.
[02:13:18.460 --> 02:13:21.540]   Not USB microphones, but we like to use those kind of microphones.
[02:13:21.540 --> 02:13:22.500]   And it just looks good.
[02:13:22.500 --> 02:13:23.340]   Look at this.
[02:13:23.340 --> 02:13:24.180]   It looks good on your desk.
[02:13:24.180 --> 02:13:26.140]   If you're a streamer, you can have it right there
[02:13:26.140 --> 02:13:28.340]   and just fiddle with the knob and that kind of thing.
[02:13:28.340 --> 02:13:29.260]   - And it's all coordinated.
[02:13:29.260 --> 02:13:30.180]   All their gears coordinated.
[02:13:30.180 --> 02:13:31.020]   - Yeah, I love it.
[02:13:31.020 --> 02:13:31.860]   - So it looks like a jam.
[02:13:31.860 --> 02:13:32.700]   - I have a stream deck.
[02:13:32.700 --> 02:13:34.180]   It sits right next to it and all that stuff.
[02:13:34.180 --> 02:13:36.940]   - And we just announced a 4K capture card I think this week.
[02:13:36.940 --> 02:13:37.780]   - Yes.
[02:13:37.780 --> 02:13:38.620]   - You can get all your.
[02:13:38.620 --> 02:13:39.460]   - Oh, God.
[02:13:39.460 --> 02:13:40.300]   - Kind of amazing.
[02:13:40.300 --> 02:13:42.660]   This is $159.99, which is the same price
[02:13:42.660 --> 02:13:46.100]   we pay for the Scarlet, the Focusrite Scarlet.
[02:13:46.100 --> 02:13:47.460]   I think it'll probably do as well.
[02:13:47.460 --> 02:13:49.500]   We'll have to test it, make sure it sounds good and all that.
[02:13:49.500 --> 02:13:52.140]   But I think it's an interesting product.
[02:13:52.140 --> 02:13:55.620]   And I really like what Elgato has started to do
[02:13:55.620 --> 02:13:56.460]   with their stuff.
[02:13:56.460 --> 02:13:59.780]   I mean, they make the streamer look good.
[02:13:59.780 --> 02:14:03.220]   - They're really good at making things,
[02:14:03.220 --> 02:14:07.100]   making the user interface just really work.
[02:14:07.100 --> 02:14:09.580]   There's a lot of industrial design and so on and so forth.
[02:14:09.580 --> 02:14:12.260]   A lot of us use their Stream Decks heavily.
[02:14:12.260 --> 02:14:13.580]   - Love the stream deck.
[02:14:13.580 --> 02:14:16.100]   They have a foot pedal now for that, which is terrible.
[02:14:16.100 --> 02:14:17.540]   - Yeah. (laughs)
[02:14:17.540 --> 02:14:19.180]   - You don't want to be able to go.
[02:14:19.180 --> 02:14:20.620]   - The foot pedal is really great
[02:14:20.620 --> 02:14:23.020]   because if you want to mute and unmute yourself in Zoom,
[02:14:23.020 --> 02:14:24.660]   you just hit, you can just sit there and work it,
[02:14:24.660 --> 02:14:26.140]   you know, doing something and tapping on it.
[02:14:26.140 --> 02:14:28.940]   - I think I have to get one of these for Lisa.
[02:14:28.940 --> 02:14:31.180]   The big knob is like the biggest selling point
[02:14:31.180 --> 02:14:32.380]   and it's got lights that go around it
[02:14:32.380 --> 02:14:33.460]   so you know what the level is.
[02:14:33.460 --> 02:14:34.740]   It's just really imperfect.
[02:14:34.740 --> 02:14:36.780]   - Yeah, I love track-kindling interfaces.
[02:14:36.780 --> 02:14:37.860]   - Yeah, it's good.
[02:14:37.860 --> 02:14:39.380]   A knob, that's a good thing, right?
[02:14:39.380 --> 02:14:40.220]   - Yeah.
[02:14:40.220 --> 02:14:41.060]   - Yeah.
[02:14:41.060 --> 02:14:42.540]   - It's weighted, it's nice.
[02:14:42.540 --> 02:14:46.380]   Anyway, Wave XLR, that's brand new from Elgato
[02:14:46.380 --> 02:14:48.900]   at elgato.com.
[02:14:48.900 --> 02:14:52.860]   And those are a picks of the week.
[02:14:52.860 --> 02:14:56.020]   Well, well, well, we've come to the end
[02:14:56.020 --> 02:14:57.380]   of this episode of Mac Break Weekly.
[02:14:57.380 --> 02:15:00.540]   Renee Richie is at youtube.com/ReneeRitchie
[02:15:00.540 --> 02:15:02.980]   celebrating two years of excellence.
[02:15:02.980 --> 02:15:03.820]   - Yes, sir.
[02:15:03.820 --> 02:15:06.220]   - Gotta watch the new video where 27 YouTubers
[02:15:06.220 --> 02:15:08.100]   ask Renee about Apple.
[02:15:08.100 --> 02:15:09.460]   I love that.
[02:15:09.460 --> 02:15:10.740]   - What is your favorite type,
[02:15:10.740 --> 02:15:12.740]   what was your favorite Taekwondo submission
[02:15:12.740 --> 02:15:15.220]   was my favorite question of all?
[02:15:15.220 --> 02:15:16.380]   - Justine, yeah, of course,
[02:15:16.380 --> 02:15:17.820]   'cause Justine is a modern day Jedi.
[02:15:17.820 --> 02:15:19.340]   - She knows, yeah.
[02:15:19.340 --> 02:15:20.180]   She knows.
[02:15:20.180 --> 02:15:22.860]   youtube.com/ReneeRitchie, congratulations Renee.
[02:15:22.860 --> 02:15:24.060]   That's great.
[02:15:24.060 --> 02:15:26.260]   I can't believe it was in two years, it's gone by fast.
[02:15:26.260 --> 02:15:29.620]   - I know, it's weird two years, Leo, but it's been.
[02:15:29.620 --> 02:15:31.940]   - Yes, a weird and wack,
[02:15:31.940 --> 02:15:35.260]   you picked exactly the most interesting time, right?
[02:15:35.260 --> 02:15:36.100]   - Yes.
[02:15:36.100 --> 02:15:36.940]   - Did you, 2020, is who knew?
[02:15:36.940 --> 02:15:38.780]   - You did this before COVID, right?
[02:15:38.780 --> 02:15:40.260]   So you didn't know it was gonna be--
[02:15:40.260 --> 02:15:43.340]   - I gave my notice in March and I gave them a month's notice,
[02:15:43.340 --> 02:15:44.740]   so I thought there'd be an Apple event,
[02:15:44.740 --> 02:15:47.340]   and then I was out of a job on March 31st,
[02:15:47.340 --> 02:15:48.820]   and everything locked down.
[02:15:48.820 --> 02:15:51.940]   - Wow, that's wild.
[02:15:51.940 --> 02:15:54.900]   Andy and Akko, what are you gonna be on GBH next?
[02:15:54.900 --> 02:15:58.940]   - I'm off this week, but I'm on next week at 1230 Friday.
[02:15:58.940 --> 02:16:02.020]   Go to wgphnews.org to stream it live or later,
[02:16:02.020 --> 02:16:04.780]   or stream it right now to listen to what we talked about
[02:16:04.780 --> 02:16:05.620]   last week.
[02:16:05.620 --> 02:16:06.740]   - Nice.
[02:16:06.740 --> 02:16:11.180]   - And of course, Alex Lindsey, officehours.global.
[02:16:11.180 --> 02:16:15.100]   They record one hour of it, but it goes on 24/7
[02:16:15.100 --> 02:16:16.700]   with lots of interesting stuff.
[02:16:16.700 --> 02:16:20.500]   And if you need Alex to, for your next big event,
[02:16:20.500 --> 02:16:24.300]   and you do, trust me, if you don't have an Alex, get him,
[02:16:24.300 --> 02:16:28.820]   090.media, he knows all about this stuff.
[02:16:28.820 --> 02:16:30.980]   - Thank you, Alex.
[02:16:30.980 --> 02:16:31.820]   - Thank you, Rene.
[02:16:31.820 --> 02:16:32.900]   - I'll get you off WebEx.
[02:16:32.900 --> 02:16:33.740]   - Thank you.
[02:16:33.740 --> 02:16:34.580]   (laughing)
[02:16:34.580 --> 02:16:35.420]   - I'll get you off, very well.
[02:16:35.420 --> 02:16:36.940]   - I still get you off WebEx.
[02:16:36.940 --> 02:16:40.260]   - I'm looking forward to getting rid of that flash plug-in
[02:16:40.260 --> 02:16:41.100]   once and for all.
[02:16:41.100 --> 02:16:42.660]   (laughing)
[02:16:42.660 --> 02:16:43.500]   - Real media, here we come.
[02:16:43.500 --> 02:16:45.180]   - Some idea that they can invite.
[02:16:45.180 --> 02:16:46.380]   - These guys are all on Zoom.
[02:16:46.380 --> 02:16:48.900]   They look 10 times better than I do, and I'm here.
[02:16:48.900 --> 02:16:52.740]   Alex is 16K.
[02:16:52.740 --> 02:16:54.980]   - Yeah, yeah, I don't know how he does it.
[02:16:54.980 --> 02:16:57.660]   - We do Mac break weekly every Tuesday, 11 a.m.
[02:16:57.660 --> 02:17:00.740]   Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern time.
[02:17:00.740 --> 02:17:02.620]   That is 2100 UTC.
[02:17:02.620 --> 02:17:05.580]   If you wanna watch us do it live live.twit.tv,
[02:17:05.580 --> 02:17:07.460]   there's audio and video streams there.
[02:17:07.460 --> 02:17:10.300]   Chat live with us at irc.twit.tv
[02:17:10.300 --> 02:17:15.140]   or in the ever wonderful, ever marvelous discord
[02:17:15.140 --> 02:17:18.140]   club twit members get access to the discord,
[02:17:18.140 --> 02:17:20.160]   which is not just show chat,
[02:17:20.160 --> 02:17:22.660]   but conversations about everything a geek would like.
[02:17:22.660 --> 02:17:25.020]   Plus ad-free versions of all of our shows
[02:17:25.020 --> 02:17:27.620]   and a special Twipless feed that includes shows
[02:17:27.620 --> 02:17:29.420]   we don't put out on the regular feeds
[02:17:29.420 --> 02:17:32.580]   like our untitled Linux show Stacey Higginbotham's book club.
[02:17:32.580 --> 02:17:35.420]   The fireside chats we had Paul throughout last week.
[02:17:35.420 --> 02:17:37.620]   Jeff Jarvis is coming up next week.
[02:17:37.620 --> 02:17:38.940]   I can go on and on.
[02:17:38.940 --> 02:17:42.140]   It is really a great club, and it's only seven bucks a month.
[02:17:42.140 --> 02:17:44.660]   Couple of Starbucks lattes, maybe just one
[02:17:44.660 --> 02:17:47.460]   if you get it with Frappuccino with half-calf,
[02:17:47.460 --> 02:17:48.860]   half decaf to the lemon.
[02:17:48.860 --> 02:17:52.940]   Seven bucks a month, twit.tv/clubtwit.
[02:17:52.940 --> 02:17:56.140]   It really helps us kind of streamline our operations.
[02:17:56.140 --> 02:17:59.860]   We thank you very much for your support in advance.
[02:18:00.820 --> 02:18:05.700]   After the show is produced, we also offer download versions
[02:18:05.700 --> 02:18:09.580]   of it for free, actually, of every show at twit.tv,
[02:18:09.580 --> 02:18:12.220]   in this case twit.tv/mbw.
[02:18:12.220 --> 02:18:15.860]   All the shows have YouTube channels dedicated to them as well.
[02:18:15.860 --> 02:18:18.020]   And you can, of course, in fact, I would encourage you
[02:18:18.020 --> 02:18:21.460]   to subscribe in your favorite podcast player.
[02:18:21.460 --> 02:18:23.620]   That way you'll get it automatically since we're done
[02:18:23.620 --> 02:18:25.540]   and the editors edits are done.
[02:18:25.540 --> 02:18:27.740]   We'll get it out to you usually by a couple hours
[02:18:27.740 --> 02:18:29.100]   after the show.
[02:18:29.100 --> 02:18:31.100]   And if your podcast player allows reviews,
[02:18:31.100 --> 02:18:32.580]   please leave us a five-star review.
[02:18:32.580 --> 02:18:35.860]   Let the world know about Mac Break Weekly.
[02:18:35.860 --> 02:18:37.180]   Thanks, everybody, for joining us.
[02:18:37.180 --> 02:18:41.420]   Get back to work now because Breaktime is over.
[02:18:41.420 --> 02:18:42.260]   Bye-bye.
[02:18:42.260 --> 02:18:44.460]   - Hey, I'm Rod Pyle, editor of Ad Astra Magazine.
[02:18:44.460 --> 02:18:46.580]   And each week I'm joined by Tariq Malek,
[02:18:46.580 --> 02:18:49.300]   the editor-in-chief over at space.com.
[02:18:49.300 --> 02:18:51.380]   In our new This Week in Space podcast,
[02:18:51.380 --> 02:18:53.620]   every Friday, Tariq and I take a deep dive
[02:18:53.620 --> 02:18:55.740]   into the stories that define the new space age.
[02:18:55.740 --> 02:18:56.940]   What's NASA up to?
[02:18:56.940 --> 02:18:59.620]   When will Americans once again set foot on the moon?
[02:18:59.620 --> 02:19:01.740]   And how about those samples from the Perseverance rover?
[02:19:01.740 --> 02:19:03.180]   When are those coming home?
[02:19:03.180 --> 02:19:05.420]   What the heck has Elon Musk done now?
[02:19:05.420 --> 02:19:07.100]   In addition to all the latest and greatest
[02:19:07.100 --> 02:19:09.780]   in space exploration, we'll take an occasional look
[02:19:09.780 --> 02:19:11.100]   at bits of space flight history
[02:19:11.100 --> 02:19:12.900]   that you probably never heard of
[02:19:12.900 --> 02:19:16.140]   and all with an eye towards having a good time along the way.
[02:19:16.140 --> 02:19:18.140]   Check us out in your favorite podcatcher.
[02:19:18.140 --> 02:19:20.740]   (upbeat music)
[02:19:20.740 --> 02:19:23.320]   (upbeat music)
[02:19:23.320 --> 02:19:25.900]   (upbeat music)
[02:19:25.900 --> 02:19:28.480]   (upbeat music)
