[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.240]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly Renee, Andy and Alex are here.
[00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.640]   I brought my new I9 MacBook Pro and my EGPU.
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.920]   We're going to see what we can do to make this thing over.
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.760]   He and Apple has a new release and update.
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.760]   It seems to have made a big difference.
[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.200]   It's all coming up next throttle gate.
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.200]   Mac Break Weekly.

[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.560]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.040]   where you talk about the latest news from Apple,
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.680]   with some of the best people in the Apple field.
[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.920]   Out in his outstanding in his field of apples right now,
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.400]   Mr. Renee Ritchie from linemore.com,
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.440]   who's been up all night.
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.400]   I feel like a Brayburn, maybe a Royal Gala today.
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.840]   I'm not sure.
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:58.680]   But yeah, it was a long day.
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.200]   I think you're delicious myself.
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.360]   Oh, hey, Honeycrisp.
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.800]   Not a granny Smith, please.
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.200]   No.
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.320]   You were up all night following Throttle Gate.
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.200]   What do we call it?
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:09.960]   Thermal Gate?
[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:10.640]   Throttle Gate?
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:11.720]   Throttle Gate is fine.
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.600]   I mean, now can we call it Digital Key?
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.360]   I don't know.
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.800]   We'll see.
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.880]   All right.
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.320]   I actually have some probably surprising to people
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.360]   who listen to the show views about all this.
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.520]   But we'll talk about it in a moment.
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.280]   Andy Inako is also here.
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.800]   Chicago Sun-time.
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.640]   Former?
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.560]   This is not the veteran.
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.160]   Veteran.
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.120]   Chicago Sun-time's reporter.
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.240]   You know why I was thinking about it?
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.080]   Because I was talking about Studs Turkel the other day.
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.520]   And I know you knew Studs.
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.320]   And I'm very jealous of all of that.
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.640]   Studs in Ebert.
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.000]   You knew him both.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.280]   I wish another reason to wish both of them were live today
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.920]   because their essays on what's going on right now
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.160]   would be epic.
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.080]   And what Tronk just did to the New York Daily News.
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.600]   Yeah.
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.200]   Yep.
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.160]   Unbelievable.
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.400]   Unbelievable.
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.840]   Also here from Washington, DC, the nation's capital.
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.240]   For a few more minutes.
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.880]   Did we move into Moscow?
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.960]   Alex Lindsey of the Pixelcore.
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.080]   Hello, Alex.
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.640]   Hello.
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:07.000]   Hello.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.160]   Hello.
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.360]   Actually, I can hear you from DC.
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.840]   Yes.
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.960]   I'm thinking we make our nation's capital,
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.480]   St. Petersburg, to distinguish it from Moscow.
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.160]   And it's a beautiful city.
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.200]   It's been really convenient because one of our offices
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.560]   now used to be Russia One.
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.560]   So the whole thing is all coming together.
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.120]   Oh, it's perfect.
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.280]   They take over our capital.
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.880]   We take over their lobby, their office.
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:30.080]   It's good.
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.120]   Perfect.
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.920]   So I'm sitting in front of something
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.720]   I actually love quite a bit.
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.480]   This is the new MacBook Pro.
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:41.880]   Yes with the i9.
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.320]   Yes with the 560.
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.840]   Yes with 32 gigs of RAM.
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.360]   And it's everything I wanted.
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.160]   Yes, it even has a touch bar and a butterfly keyboard.
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.160]   But I'm very, very happy.
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.160]   You might also notice there's a bit of help
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.160]   on the side here, the Blackmagic thermal tower of doom.
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.000]   Oh, this is the E.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.800]   It does look very empire, doesn't it?
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.200]   EGPU with the 580 in it.
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.200]   Radeon 580.
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.760]   But I, you know, and I've been banging on this quite a bit.
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.960]   We talked about a lot on Saturday
[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.760]   on the new screensavers with Patrick Norton.
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.760]   I was, you know, I'm going to give you an analogy, Renee.
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.160]   You tell me if this makes sense to you.
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.760]   And by the way, there's very, very big news already
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.760]   on this throttle gate front.
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.760]   I kind of dispute the whole notion of throttle gate.
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.760]   I think of this as like my Tesla.
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:43.760]   So my Tesla, I love it because it's got amazing pickup.
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.760]   You know, torque, you know, 100% torque at zero miles an hour.
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.760]   It could beat a Lamborghini in zero to 60.
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.760]   It's an amazing car, but you wouldn't want to do it
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.760]   in the 500 with it because it can't keep up a sustained speed
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.760]   for more than five or 10 minutes at over 120 miles,
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.760]   103 miles an hour because the electric motor's heat up
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.760]   and then it actually gets it throttles it down to a slower speed.
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:15.760]   But for my purposes, the pickup, the speed, everything it does
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.760]   in my normal day-to-day driving, I don't actually have
[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.760]   an occasion to drive 120 miles an hour very often.
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:21.760]   It's great.
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.760]   And I certainly don't do it for more than 10 minutes.
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:24.760]   It's great.
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.760]   If maybe if I lived in Germany and I were on the auto bond,
[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.760]   I would say, well, I'm going to get them Mercedes instead.
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:29.760]   But for me, it's great.
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.760]   I feel like that's kind of what I'm experiencing
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:32.760]   with the MacBook Pro.
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.760]   I've been throwing a lot of the kinds of things I do at it
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.760]   because, for instance, one of the reasons I wanted
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.760]   is Lightroom is such a pig.
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.760]   I wanted to be able to review raw images without waiting.
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:48.760]   What people suggest is, what you do is you put your raw images
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.760]   on the computer, your Lightroom Create previews,
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.760]   go have dinner while it's doing that when you come back.
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.760]   But I don't want to do that.
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:57.760]   I want to put them and review the images now.
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:58.760]   You had dinner already.
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:59.760]   I already had dinner.
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.760]   And this is fine for that.
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:07.760]   My compilation, when I do a lot of coding, it's so fast.
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.760]   It runs so quick.
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:10.760]   The programs run quicker.
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:14.760]   I did a full build of e-max from zero.
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:17.760]   In about nine minutes on this, it took 12 minutes on my 2015.
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.760]   That's about what I expect from the different clock speeds.
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:25.760]   But in those cases I just described, I never go below
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.760]   the rated 2.9 gigahertz.
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.760]   And most of the time, I'm at three and a half to four gigahertz.
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.760]   It's throttled up speedstep works.
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.760]   I also get, and I was really worried about this,
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.760]   superior battery life, because when I'm not doing tough stuff,
[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.760]   when I'm just looking at email or the web,
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:45.760]   it goes down to one gigahertz or lower.
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.760]   And I never paid attention to this before, but now because of
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:51.760]   throttlegate, I got the Intel widget and I'm looking at all this stuff.
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:56.760]   And I'm getting around 13 hours of battery life until I do something
[00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:57.760]   that's really thermal.
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:01.760]   I do notice that it will not let the processor get above 100 degrees
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:02.760]   Celsius.
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:03.760]   That is like the absolute limit.
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:08.760]   The minute, whatever I'm doing, whether it's hand-breaking coding or motion,
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.760]   the minute I do that, it does throttle down.
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.760]   It throttles well below 2.9 gigahertz.
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:15.760]   One of the things I want to do, and maybe we'll do it before the end of the show,
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:21.760]   is put logic on here and see if I can do a giant logic pro mix with 100 voices.
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:23.760]   Because that's something a lot of people want to do.
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:26.760]   It's also worth pointing out that Intel will not disclose them,
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:32.760]   but all the AVC, all the AVX2 frequencies are well below the baseline
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:33.760]   frequencies.
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:36.760]   They won't tell anybody what they are, but if it's hitting vector,
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:39.760]   it is normally going to be below baseline frequencies.
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:43.760]   So for me and my uses, I like this, and by the way, just to touch on the butterfly
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:48.760]   key, whatever they did, those silicon domes, I haven't gotten any breadcrumbs in
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.760]   there yet, so I can't touch for its reliability.
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:54.760]   But it's funny because I hated the other one.
[00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.760]   And Andy, I know you hated it too.
[00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:57.760]   I would like you to try these.
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:01.760]   It's just enough softening when it hits bottom that actually I,
[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:03.760]   I can live with this.
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:04.760]   I like this.
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:07.760]   I don't love it, but this keyboard is usable, completely usable.
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:09.760]   I've tried about two hours.
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:12.760]   I've got about two hours logged in on the new keyboard.
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.760]   It's better, but it doesn't, I still don't like it.
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:17.760]   Yeah, I mean, if, yeah, I can understand that.
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.760]   It's still a deal breaker for me.
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:20.760]   Yep, unfortunately.
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:21.760]   Yep.
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:26.760]   So let us, by the way, one of the reasons I can't show you the screens
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:30.760]   is because just this morning, Apple pushed out a firmware update for the
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:33.760]   MacBook Pros that supposedly addresses.
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:37.760]   And I know Dave Lee, who was the guy who initially talked about
[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:41.760]   throttling on his YouTube channel, is happy about this patch.
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.760]   It fixes some stuff.
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:45.760]   Tell us what this patch does Renee.
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:49.760]   So what happened was Apple reached out to Dave once they saw his video
[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:52.760]   because they could not reproduce the situation he was getting.
[00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:55.760]   And it sounds like it took a little while before he could reproduce it as well,
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.760]   but they worked together over the weekend.
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:59.760]   I'm sure nobody got a lot of sleep there.
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:01.760]   And they managed to figure out what was causing it.
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:04.760]   And it was a missing digital key.
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:07.760]   Now, there's a lot of debate over what that is because a lot of this stuff
[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:08.760]   is not well documented.
[00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:12.760]   And I think, you know, because Intel is super proprietary and Apple is super
[00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:13.760]   proprietary.
[00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:14.760]   And there's not a lot of information on this stuff.
[00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:17.760]   But people are guessing that it was basically either an erroneous or
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:22.760]   missing registry entry that was not often being hit because none of Apple's
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:23.760]   benchmarks hit it.
[00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:26.760]   None of the pros that Apple, you know, had it there for us to talk to people in
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:28.760]   the music industry, the video industry.
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:30.760]   None of them were being affected by it.
[00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:34.760]   But it was this mixed workload of red, raw footage and Adobe Premiere.
[00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:37.760]   That was basically bringing the computer to its knees.
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:38.760]   Oh, interesting.
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:41.760]   So this patch fixes that missing digital key.
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.760]   It doesn't fix everything.
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:44.760]   It just fixes that one thing.
[00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:46.760]   It makes everything better.
[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:50.760]   This might have been causing some slowdown on a lot of workloads, but not
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:52.760]   huge amounts, but on a specific workload Dave had.
[00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:54.760]   It was causing cataclysmic slowdown.
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:58.760]   So what about my Tesla analogy?
[00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:00.760]   Is that a reasonable analogy?
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:03.760]   Most people shouldn't buy an I9 because it is six cores.
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:05.760]   It is a lot hotter.
[00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:09.760]   We were able to get when I was compressing handbrake and the processor was
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:14.760]   100 degrees Celsius, I was able to get the keyboard to about 105 degrees
[00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:15.760]   Fahrenheit.
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:17.760]   Really almost too hot to touch.
[00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:18.760]   Yeah.
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:19.760]   Yeah.
[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:20.760]   No, that's very true.
[00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:23.760]   So I mean Moore's law or houses law, whatever you want to call it,
[00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:26.760]   the idea that we're going to get double performance every 18 months is dead and
[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:27.760]   dying.
[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:28.760]   Yeah.
[00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:31.760]   And Intel's had two years to, like, it, like, what's supposed to come out on
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.760]   their 10 nanometer process two years ago and they still haven't gotten it
[00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:35.760]   out.
[00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.760]   So what they're doing is reverting to adding cores to increase performance
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:40.760]   because they're still expected to get year over year performance.
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:43.760]   And so Apple is basically treating these like they treat mobile processors.
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:47.760]   And that is we still want the fastest single core performance we can get,
[00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:50.760]   but that means when you start hitting these massive multi core loads,
[00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:52.760]   we have to throttle it down because it's going to be too hot.
[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:54.760]   It's going to melt the machine.
[00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:55.760]   And that analogy is spot on.
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:58.760]   You could also look at it like people were complaining, I have a Lamborghini
[00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:01.760]   and it's on a highway in traffic and I can't let it lose.
[00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:05.760]   The reality is we've moved to the cities now, but the thing is instead of
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:09.760]   four Lamborghinis, you now have six Lamborghinis so you can move four more
[00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:11.760]   people at the same time, even in traffic.
[00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:14.760]   And that's sort of how you have to look at multi core workloads now.
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:18.760]   And I will grant that this is not the right computer for a lot of people.
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:21.760]   I mean, I'm comparing it to my, I have an I'm 10 core, I'm at pro at home.
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:25.760]   And if I have the luxury of using that for most of this stuff,
[00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:29.760]   certainly for hand break or rendering 360 videos, I will use that.
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:31.760]   Yeah, that's their alternative.
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:36.760]   Like if you really want a 17 inch computer with F 22 Raptor size vents on it
[00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:38.760]   that weighs 10 pounds that Apple doesn't make that.
[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:39.760]   They want to make one chassis.
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:41.760]   They can sell to millions of people.
[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:44.760]   So they will gladly show you an I'm Mac or an I'm Mac pro for those kinds of thermal.
[00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:47.760]   I also point out, according to the disk speed test,
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:52.760]   we're getting reads and writes around 2600 megabytes per second,
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:57.760]   which is very fast, but the Mac book pro remember was even faster.
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:59.760]   I mean, the I'm Mac pro was even faster.
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:01.760]   So this should equal.
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:03.760]   I mean, I'll think all other things being the same.
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:06.760]   I think this should be because I think believe they're using the same storage
[00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:09.760]   controller and the same striped well, two disc format.
[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:13.760]   As you can see on the black magic speed test, it's fine for, you know,
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:15.760]   4k video at 60 frames reading.
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:20.760]   I mean, it's got green checks everywhere, but it is not as fast as the I'm Mac pro.
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:21.760]   Now, I don't know why not.
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:23.760]   Maybe there's some other issue going on there.
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:24.760]   Cinebench score on this.
[00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:30.760]   And that was what a lot of people were complaining about was Cinebench because
[00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:35.760]   if you run the and I know Cinebench isn't exactly a synthetic,
[00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:39.760]   but it isn't exactly not synthetic.
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:42.760]   The bigger the biggest problem is that Cinebench put out a statement saying they were not
[00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:44.760]   optimized for the I9 and that people shouldn't use it.
[00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:45.760]   Oh, well, there you go.
[00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:47.760]   So people keep using it.
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:48.760]   I was in open GL.
[00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:52.760]   I was actually very surprised able to get 100 frames a second, but the,
[00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:55.760]   but the CPU was down below 900 is I think was 853.
[00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:58.760]   Intel also took their power gadget down over the weekend and put up an
[00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:01.760]   incremented version and that's basically I think maintained by one engineer.
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:02.760]   They don't update it very often.
[00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:05.760]   I have the new, I have the new the power gadget.
[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:06.760]   I'll show you screenshots though.
[00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:11.760]   This is, this is the kind of thing I do and it is, it is, it is faster.
[00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:15.760]   This is the kind of thing I, they want to see the monitor.
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:16.760]   Hold on a second.
[00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:18.760]   I, they're not seeing the monitors.
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:19.760]   Hold on.
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:22.760]   I want to be able to give you a screen out.
[00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:29.760]   So, but what about my contention that it's, it's like, it is, it is kind of like the Tesla
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:30.760]   and that respect.
[00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:31.760]   Yeah, no, absolutely.
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:35.760]   It's, it's, if you're spending $6,000 on it's absolutely a very special,
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:40.760]   I guess Alex would probably have the best analogy, but it's, it's a very specific set of skills.
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:41.760]   Yeah.
[00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:42.760]   Yeah.
[00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:47.760]   I mean, I think that one of the things that is, I, I feel like Apple misses the mark on the
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:53.320]   pro side because they, because they are trying to fit it into this tiny form factor, which
[00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:54.320]   we don't care about.
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:55.320]   Yeah.
[00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:57.760]   And we do know, by the way, from my fix it that they did not modify the fans or any of
[00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:02.040]   the cooling subsystems, this is the same as last year's MacBook Pro.
[00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:03.040]   Right.
[00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:05.280]   And, and I feel like if you're going to keep on making them and calling them pro, you know,
[00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:08.360]   I mean, that your primary audience, I mean, there are a lot of people.
[00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:12.800]   You see a lot of people that are, that work in, in, you know, information companies that
[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:16.120]   they, they want the pro version so that they can have the pro, you know, I don't, I don't
[00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:18.120]   know what they're using it for.
[00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:22.240]   But the, so I think that, you know, I think the folks that are designing these are not
[00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:23.240]   pushing them very hard.
[00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:25.640]   They're not really those professionals that need it.
[00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:30.040]   And so I think it's unfortunate that, that we do have to consider going to a PC to get
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:31.760]   the real, the real performance out of it.
[00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:35.880]   You know, that's kind of a, as a Mac user, I mean, it's, we'll put up with it.
[00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:40.600]   So I guess Apple's got it, but I think that you are looking at a significant slowdown
[00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:48.040]   of, you know, purchases, you know, I don't feel hugely like I need to keep on upgrading.
[00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:52.440]   You know, and so, you know, until, until my computer actually stops working, I probably,
[00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:55.400]   you know, will be slow to upgrade.
[00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:59.520]   You know, I don't think that, you know, it's not enough, you know, to make it, to make
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:01.160]   it worth it, in my opinion.
[00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:03.520]   So, you know, I still have, I've relatively good iMac.
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:05.080]   I haven't gotten the iMac Pro yet.
[00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:08.240]   I'm a little, a little behind those, those curves.
[00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:10.280]   I just haven't needed it.
[00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:12.960]   But, but I think that Apple isn't really building.
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:15.480]   We'll see what happens with the new Mac Pro that comes out.
[00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:16.800]   I do think the iMac Pro is great.
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:19.880]   We just haven't had a, usually we buy stuff against projects.
[00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:23.440]   I think if you're a developer, you'll be happy with this.
[00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:26.440]   I think if you're a photographer, I think if you're doing transcoding video, you will
[00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:28.880]   not be happy about with this even with the new watch.
[00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:32.240]   And I guess if you're a photographer, I don't know if you'd be that, you were that hard
[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:33.240]   off before.
[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:34.240]   I think that's the problem.
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:35.240]   That's the problem.
[00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:36.240]   Right.
[00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:37.240]   So, that's the other question.
[00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:38.240]   It works great.
[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:40.800]   Compare this to a current i7 or last year's i7.
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:41.800]   And you probably...
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:42.800]   Yeah.
[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:43.800]   Are you really, not really going to notice?
[00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:46.400]   I mean, you know, like the hard part is, is that as this slows down, this is the problem
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:50.320]   that the PC industry has had for a long time, which is that everything, you know, Excel
[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:53.920]   runs as fast as it needs to, you know, and, and other things.
[00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:58.120]   So, so I think that the challenge really is, is a lot of these apps aren't really, you don't
[00:15:58.120 --> 00:15:59.760]   notice it that much from time to time.
[00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:03.760]   A lot of people that have been pushing these computers gave up on Apple a while ago.
[00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:07.400]   And so the ones that are really pushing it and really need the performance, a lot of
[00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:11.280]   them have been dropping off and using PCs or Linux to get the performance that they
[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:12.280]   need.
[00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:14.440]   And so there's less pressure on Apple, I think, to do that.
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:19.480]   But they're still kind of the creative professional that they're going after.
[00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:23.680]   And I'm not sure that what they put out makes enough of a difference to...
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:24.680]   I mean, you know, there's definitely...
[00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:27.160]   It does for me because there's pent up demand.
[00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:29.840]   I was on a 2015 and it is definitely...
[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:35.560]   It's 30%, 25% faster than the 2015 i7.
[00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:38.120]   So it's a reasonable upgrade.
[00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:41.200]   It's a, you know, my three-year upgrade.
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:44.360]   My question was if I could live with a butterfly keys and I can.
[00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:45.920]   So that's good.
[00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:47.600]   I think, well, that's been, that's been my problem.
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:50.000]   And until I really feel like my 2015 hurts.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.160]   And admittedly, when I'm doing hard work, I'm using either a Mac Pro or I'm using an
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:58.000]   iMac and, you know, the, the, the, that's pretty souped up.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.880]   And so I'm, or when I'm really doing heavy, heavy work, I'm, you know, using a PC.
[00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:03.000]   And there's still lots of guests.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.040]   So I know you're waiting for a Mac mini.
[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:10.040]   I know a lot of people are waiting for a upgraded MacBook or MacBook Air.
[00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:11.040]   Yeah.
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:12.040]   Great, I think that Apple...
[00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:13.040]   I think that Apple...
[00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:17.240]   Interesting theory on Sunday that maybe the real MacBook Air MacBook upgrade will be to
[00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:22.000]   go to an Apple A12 chip or something like that.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.040]   Well, and I don't know why they build an Air.
[00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:27.520]   I mean, I think that, I think that really there is the Mac, I think that there's just
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:30.360]   the MacBook Pros and then I think there's a 13 inch iPad.
[00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:35.320]   I'm not sure if it, you know, I don't, you know, I don't know why Apple differentiates
[00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:36.320]   it that much.
[00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:37.320]   I'm not sure if they will.
[00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:38.520]   I'm not sure they will either.
[00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:40.520]   We've talked about that.
[00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:43.600]   So Renee, what is the issue?
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:47.000]   Somebody also posted, oh no, the real issue is power.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   Oh, that's...
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   There were so many theories.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   There were so many theories.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   There were so many, I mean...
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   Yeah.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.600]   And there's a couple of problems here and they're quick to point out.
[00:17:54.600 --> 00:18:00.000]   Like I did a podcast with Ian from Anantec yesterday because I just wanted him to explain
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.600]   the I9 to me because I felt like that was a good starting point.
[00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:07.600]   And Anantec does terrific work on all this stuff, but not everybody is Anantec.
[00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:12.240]   And what you get is a bunch of people who just like download a benchmark tool, run it
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:13.480]   and mistake that for data.
[00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:14.960]   And it really isn't.
[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:18.440]   So you have a bunch of people with very little insight into what's going on because these
[00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:22.440]   processes now are so complicated and it's really hard to tell what's hitting CPU, what's
[00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:23.440]   hitting GPU.
[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:26.360]   Like for example, if you're doing transcoding, it might be hitting an accelerator and not
[00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:30.520]   hitting the CPU or the GPU or like we said before, it might be hitting vector and that's
[00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:34.360]   got a slower frequency than even baseline frequencies.
[00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:37.040]   And what is, you know, is a tool optimized for what you're measuring because all these
[00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:41.360]   people were doing cinebench and cinebench itself said, "Hey, don't do that."
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:43.240]   And it creates a lot of noise.
[00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:44.240]   And there were some people like...
[00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:45.240]   I think partly it's YouTubers.
[00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:46.240]   There's too many YouTubers.
[00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:50.120]   There's too many YouTubers and too few Anantics in the world.
[00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:51.280]   Well, I mean, they're not a mon...
[00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:56.360]   So yeah, there's also like a bunch of bad blog posts, a bunch of really bad Reddit threads.
[00:18:56.360 --> 00:19:01.040]   And there's like Jonathan Morrison, I thought that really good tests on his channel, but
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:02.720]   not everybody does that sort of thing.
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:06.360]   And there was a bunch of blog posts that were just as sensational as possible.
[00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:10.280]   You know, Apple's deliberately doing this and anything you can imagine.
[00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:11.280]   But it take...
[00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:15.520]   When you're dealing with something like this, it does take a little bit of time to gather
[00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:18.600]   quite a bit of data and then come to an educated opinion about it.
[00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:21.240]   I think, again, I think Anantic is usually the best at doing that.
[00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:23.000]   Yeah, I've been waiting till they have something to say.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.440]   I'll listen to Vector because I'm curious what they had.
[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:26.440]   Oh, it was...
[00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:27.440]   Yeah, no, he is super...
[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:28.440]   You know, he's super smart.
[00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:31.160]   And Ryan Smith is doing the review of the MacBook Pro.
[00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:32.160]   Super smart.
[00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:34.440]   And there's just so many things that are going on with an I-9.
[00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:37.840]   Like again, Intel said it was going to be the same power, but turns out it's not exactly
[00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:39.640]   the same power footprint.
[00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:40.640]   And Intel is supposed to be...
[00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:43.240]   Do you think Apple kind of got screwed by Intel?
[00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:47.840]   That Apple was expecting a 10-nanometer part by now.
[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:51.760]   And they just released this app because of pressure from pros that they really would
[00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:54.280]   have liked to have done as Wade another year.
[00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:55.480]   I don't know if they would have liked to wait.
[00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:58.960]   I think Apple has been screwed by Intel so many times over the years.
[00:19:58.960 --> 00:19:59.960]   They're...
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:01.600]   Well, I don't think it's expected.
[00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:03.040]   Intel has gotten much worse.
[00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:04.040]   It used to be like months.
[00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:06.720]   Like they would be all ready for their big announcement and then, oh, it's going to
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:07.720]   take another month.
[00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:10.720]   And that just blows Apple's release schedule and they wait for the next event.
[00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:12.280]   But now it's like years.
[00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:16.320]   It is literally two years behind its roadmap and they're experimenting.
[00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:20.520]   I think it's at five different types of process to get to 10-nanometer and they're taking
[00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:23.160]   their time thinking they'll be the best when they get there.
[00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:27.240]   But meanwhile, everyone else is moving on and they gave Apple a six-core chip that's
[00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:30.360]   supposed to run in the same envelope as a four-core chip.
[00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:31.360]   And that's all...
[00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:33.320]   That's what they're doing to provide performance increases.
[00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:36.480]   And Apple is expected to provide year-over-year performance increases.
[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:39.680]   And it's probably be terrible for them if they didn't release new MacBook Pros this
[00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:40.680]   year.
[00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:43.560]   And MacBook Pro audience is already super angry at them.
[00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:47.200]   There is one thing I noticed by the way on this MacBook Pro, the sound is a lot better
[00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.200]   than the old MacBook Pro.
[00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:49.720]   The speakers are better.
[00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:51.560]   They took more space for the speakers.
[00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:56.000]   They have that new audio team too and that super enormous production lab and that team
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.600]   is doing really good work.
[00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:02.400]   I also was a little worried with the i9 that I would have terrible battery life.
[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:05.120]   And of course you would if you're doing...
[00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:09.120]   I was doing triangulation and I had kept Lightroom running in the background making one-to-one
[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:13.000]   previews on thousands of photos and I only got an hour battery life.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.800]   Even though it didn't throttle by the way, it was up almost to four gigahertz.
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:21.000]   You know it was pretty consistent performance but it was killing the battery.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:26.040]   On the other hand, last couple of days I've just been having the normal browser and the
[00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:30.280]   simple stuff that I normally do and I'm getting really good battery life actually.
[00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:36.760]   So it strikes me that there is some really good power management going on with this i9 chip.
[00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:40.240]   It's super aggressive and they've got a bigger battery and again I think Apple is looking
[00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:42.280]   at it the way they look at an iPad now.
[00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:43.280]   These are...
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:44.280]   Apple doesn't even call them laptops anymore.
[00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:49.040]   They call them portables and it really is a continuum for them and right now these make
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:51.040]   sense with a clamshell and Intel processors.
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:56.040]   But I think to Alex's point, this is going to be a spectrum of mobile devices and all
[00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:59.840]   of them are going to be as fast as possible for single thread burst and then as aggressively
[00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:05.840]   managed as possible for multi-core workloads.
[00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:07.680]   So what's your recommendation?
[00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:08.680]   Who should get a 9.9?
[00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:10.320]   Who should get a 9.7?
[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:11.680]   Who should get a Windows machine?
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:14.400]   If time is more precious to you than money.
[00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:16.800]   Like there are people that I've talked to them.
[00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:21.400]   If you render two videos a week, you're not going to get any benefit from the i9.
[00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:24.720]   If you render two videos every 15 minutes, it is literally going to be life altering
[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:28.160]   to you to save two or three minutes out of every one of those while you're on client
[00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:30.640]   calls while you're doing iterations, all those things.
[00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:31.960]   And I think those people are already buying.
[00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:35.640]   They're just like the take my money people because they literally have way more money
[00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:36.840]   than they have time.
[00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:39.800]   But for everyone else, I mean i7, even a 13 inch.
[00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:45.800]   If time is short, what you want to do is 4K red video rendering.
[00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:47.800]   Maybe this isn't the right choice either for you.
[00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:48.800]   I mean.
[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:51.520]   I mean the Despacito guy, we're using it and loving it because they could get that video
[00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:53.120]   off to the artist in two minutes.
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:56.560]   He'd get back to them and they would do the next video while he was talking to them.
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:59.480]   And their biggest bottleneck was getting the guy on the phone.
[00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:09.200]   Yeah, I mean I think that the it is I would still wait a month or two.
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:13.640]   I mean I think that anytime Apple, anytime a new product comes out, but especially when
[00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:18.720]   Apple puts out, I find that there's oftentimes just a little bit of like there's, they're
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:20.800]   not quite done when it comes out.
[00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:26.080]   And so I'm a big fan of if you're going to spend that kind of money, I of course will
[00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:31.280]   get an I9, but I'll wait for two or three months to make sure that they kind of settle
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:34.920]   into it and make sure that little bits and bobs are sorted out.
[00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:36.320]   I think that that probably.
[00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:41.800]   So I have the, I think I'm going to return this one.
[00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:42.880]   This is the four.
[00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:45.240]   This is the two or the four terabyte drive.
[00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:47.240]   This is ridiculously expensive.
[00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:49.520]   Yeah, I was turning that one.
[00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:53.120]   I was so enticed by that because I didn't want to ever have to do an external drive again.
[00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:55.920]   But my review unit is two terabytes and it's been fine.
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:59.040]   And I think I'm ultimately, because I have a review unit now, but I always buy my own,
[00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:02.880]   I'm going to get the two terabyte 13 inch, I think, because I think that'll be enough
[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:05.120]   and just having the two terabytes will be enough.
[00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:09.000]   And the portability to me is still more important than the, because I have the iMac Pro for
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   big workload.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.200]   So I just, I actually try to get us.
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:17.320]   I would, I probably won't get larger than a one terabyte or, you know, I want something
[00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:20.360]   small because I like to force myself to take things off my drive.
[00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:24.800]   You know, I don't, you know, the putting all of that on there beyond the convenience of
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:26.800]   it is, you know, dangerous.
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:30.280]   And it also, you know, I try to keep most of the stuff that I really care about outside
[00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:36.280]   of my, my internal drive, mostly so that if I decide, Oh, I'm going to walk out and use
[00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:39.920]   this as a coffee shop or I'm going to take it out and put it in the back of my car while
[00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:41.080]   I'm in a meeting.
[00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:44.160]   I want to know that I can just leave my hard drive at home, you know, back in the, you
[00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:45.880]   know, home or wherever.
[00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:46.880]   Yeah.
[00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:47.880]   Final cut is so.
[00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:48.880]   Sorry.
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:53.800]   And also I think that this is another instance where I want to see what happens to the first
[00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:59.480]   generation of people who are using that raid based four terabytes before I would use that
[00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:01.240]   for mission and critical stuff.
[00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:04.800]   Yeah, I would agree.
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:09.840]   And also I guess one of the questions a lot of people were asking is why get an I nine?
[00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:11.920]   Why not get an I seven or even an I five?
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:18.040]   If the I nine is going to throttle and be I five speed, what I mean, the I nine is the
[00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:19.040]   only difference.
[00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:21.560]   The nine and the I seven is that it's a couple of hundred megahertz faster.
[00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:22.560]   Right.
[00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:27.160]   The guy, the guy, the guy did say that if you put it in the freezer, it was pretty fast.
[00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:28.960]   Like, that's not very bad.
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:29.960]   So what did you say?
[00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:30.960]   Sorry.
[00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:33.320]   If you was like, so again, it really is workload dependent.
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:36.520]   If you want the single thread boost, then you're going to want the fat because you're
[00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:38.160]   not using a lot of course speed.
[00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:41.360]   Yeah, because you're not going to be hitting all those cores and the cores are kind of
[00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:44.840]   yeah, you would have put up with them to get a nine nine, but it's the I nine single thread,
[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:46.840]   a single thread turbo that you want.
[00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:47.840]   Okay.
[00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:51.600]   I will say that I don't know.
[00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:57.440]   I'm not, you know, if I would probably still try to figure out how to maybe create more,
[00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:03.040]   you know, more airflow, you know, myself or do something that actually cools it down.
[00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:06.840]   You know, if I really wanted to use it as a renderer, the problem is is that the CPU
[00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:10.880]   is really, really used when you're doing stuff that's over a period of time.
[00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:15.000]   So the problem with the throttling is, is when I pound it is actually it's going to be
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.280]   pounded for a prolonged period of time.
[00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:20.560]   So if it starts getting, you know, caught up in this, it becomes problematic.
[00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:22.080]   It's not it's rendering.
[00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:23.440]   It's compressing.
[00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:27.280]   It's doing all these things because when it's when you need to do it as a fast Twitch response,
[00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:32.520]   you have a GPU to lean on to do the things that you need in very short bursts and the
[00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:34.480]   GPU we already know isn't very good.
[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:37.440]   So, so it's unless you use the external one.
[00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:39.480]   Well, let's ask about that now.
[00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:44.960]   So I, you know, I bought this more for show than because I'm not, I'm not carrying it.
[00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:46.160]   I'm carrying this around with me.
[00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:50.640]   This is, you put two of them, two of them on your back.
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:55.960]   Yeah, partly I'm using it as a dock because it has, you know, it's got a four USB type
[00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:57.920]   A slots in the bag.
[00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:01.880]   It's got two type C's, one of which is connected to the MacBook.
[00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:02.880]   It's only 80 Watts of power.
[00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:05.080]   I wish it was a little bit more power.
[00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:09.720]   That's one thing I noticed by the way is if you are really working the processor on this,
[00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:14.480]   even at the charger that comes with the MacBook Pro isn't enough to keep it charging.
[00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:19.520]   You might want to find a 100 watt charger somewhere.
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:21.520]   But is this worth 700 bucks?
[00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:22.520]   It's not upgradable.
[00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:24.320]   It is silent.
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:25.680]   I'll vouch for that.
[00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:28.440]   And it's kind of a beautiful thing to have on your desktop.
[00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:32.080]   If you were going to use, if you didn't want to buy an iMac Pro, but you were going to
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:35.440]   use this for heavy duty stuff, does the eGPU make a difference?
[00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:38.040]   That's the only reason they made it was because they wanted a fanless option.
[00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:41.360]   Nobody else was making one because there's a certain people who just want to connect a
[00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:45.440]   Vive headset, have no noise on their desk and go about their business and they were not
[00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:46.440]   being served.
[00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:49.840]   But everyone else is being served way better by the modular eGPU.
[00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:51.000]   eGPU is out there.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   They're cheaper.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.720]   Of course, you have to buy a card which may end up costing a lot more.
[00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:56.440]   So you get any card you want.
[00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:57.440]   But you get any card.
[00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:58.920]   Well, you don't want to get an Nvidia card.
[00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:00.360]   That's going to be a pain in the back to get worse.
[00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:03.400]   If you're a complete hobbyist nerd who wants nothing more than to hack an Nvidia card
[00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:07.600]   into your Mac, not yourself otherwise put it in a AMD.
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:12.760]   The 580 is not the top of the line by any means radion, but it does add a little oomph
[00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:15.560]   to this, I guess.
[00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:20.520]   I really used for developers who just didn't want noise because Apple's biggest pro segment
[00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:22.520]   now is developers by far.
[00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:24.480]   And some of them just don't want their fussy.
[00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:26.240]   They don't want their coffee the way they want it.
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:27.880]   They want their bubbly water the way they want it.
[00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:29.440]   And they don't want any fan noise ever.
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:32.320]   And this device lets them do everything they want to do without having and keeping their
[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:33.320]   aesthetic.
[00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:36.960]   Ironically, the fan noise on the MacBook Pro is pretty noisy and whiny.
[00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:37.960]   Yeah, when it ramps up.
[00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:38.960]   When it ramps up.
[00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:43.640]   If you're getting up to 100 degrees, you're going to hear it big time.
[00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:45.720]   Somebody suggested getting the fan control app.
[00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:46.720]   That seems stupid.
[00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:47.720]   I got it.
[00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:48.720]   And it's like, what?
[00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:49.920]   I mean, just let Apple control the fans.
[00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:50.920]   Yeah, that's bad.
[00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:54.080]   I don't know any reason to do that.
[00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:56.520]   There's nothing more quiet than a broken computer.
[00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:58.680]   Yeah, it's really quiet.
[00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:00.320]   No startup noises.
[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:01.320]   No nothing.
[00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:05.000]   I'm pretty happy to be honest with you.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:09.480]   So I want to download a large logic pro.
[00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:14.760]   I think one thing I haven't tested is, and one of the things they mentioned, you mentioned
[00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:19.000]   Despacito using all those tracks that it was able to compile.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.720]   I want to download a large logic pro project.
[00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:24.000]   So where can I get one of those?
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   I wonder.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:29.440]   Well, the guy, I'm forgetting his last name now, but he does Ariana Grande and a bunch
[00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:31.760]   of the real famous top 40 people.
[00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:35.880]   And he said that on the previous one, he'd hit the limits of logic pro about 15 to 20%
[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:36.880]   of the time.
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:39.080]   And he hasn't hit them at all on a new one yet.
[00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:41.320]   Here's a Bollywood remix of Despacito.
[00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:43.640]   Let me download that.
[00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:47.920]   Or maybe, can I download it?
[00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:51.320]   If I can download it, I'll run it here.
[00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:53.200]   Yeah, splice.
[00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:55.880]   Oh, I have to get, I have to join splice to get it.
[00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:56.960]   Never mind.
[00:29:56.960 --> 00:30:00.360]   Because I would, I want to get something really big.
[00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:05.640]   Everybody in the chatroom, find me a giant logic pro project.
[00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:07.120]   Bohemian Rhapsody.
[00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:08.120]   That would be fun.
[00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:12.160]   Something with a lot of tracks, like a hundred tracks, something complicated.
[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:13.720]   This is America.
[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:14.960]   This is America.
[00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:15.960]   Yes.
[00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:17.720]   Let's bring me Danny Glover.
[00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:19.840]   I mean, what's his name Glover?
[00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:20.840]   Childish Gambino.
[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:21.840]   Childish Gambino.
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:22.840]   Childish Gambino.
[00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:26.760]   I want child, you know, didn't nine inch nails, didn't Trent publish a bunch of, I think
[00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:27.760]   they were a garage band.
[00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:33.560]   It's in nine, I'm just looking at it right now, actually, while you were talking.
[00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:34.560]   Yeah.
[00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:40.640]   Yeah, so it's on nine remixes.com/multitracks.php.
[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:45.600]   But he just searched nine inch nails, multi-track, or I was doing it under, I did nine inch nails.
[00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:47.680]   I was wondering whether they'd put them out in logic.
[00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:49.160]   Yeah, I think it's a garage band.
[00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:51.000]   But I can just import it, I imagine.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   I don't know.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.480]   I'm no expert on this stuff.
[00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:54.480]   It's a zip.
[00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:55.960]   Yeah, you should be able to just import a logic.
[00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:56.960]   Where's the AGP?
[00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:57.960]   What's the best way to help?
[00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:03.320]   Is it only in what you said developers, but most compilers don't use eGPUs.
[00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:06.920]   No, mostly for like VR, if someone's doing like the type of old environment, or you're
[00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:09.360]   using Final Cut Pro and you want to do a 60 video.
[00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:12.600]   How do you use an Oculus or a Vibel with this?
[00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:16.080]   I don't think it supports Oculus, but you just plug Vib right in and it just goes right
[00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:18.400]   into the HDMI port and then you plug into the other port.
[00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:19.960]   So I could use the Vibel with this?
[00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:24.480]   Yeah, and you could go into Final Cut Pro and do a 360 video, all that kind of stuff.
[00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:30.400]   And I think that the adapter box for the Vibel, which I have, is I believe that it wasn't
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:33.440]   that much less expensive than the Black Magic.
[00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:35.600]   So it's kind of like you could just have a...
[00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:38.240]   You do need something that's kind of in between anyway.
[00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:43.760]   And so being able to just connect the Vibel to that box instead of the utility box that
[00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:47.200]   was out there before I think would make sense.
[00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:48.200]   Nice.
[00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:49.200]   Okay.
[00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:51.680]   You can play Rec Room dominantly, oh.
[00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:54.280]   Actually, I might keep this just for the Vibel.
[00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:55.280]   It would be kind of cool.
[00:31:55.280 --> 00:32:01.000]   No, see, people who are not watching the Sun Video all throughout the past five minutes,
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.440]   he's been reaching out and touching it and like hitting it and stroking it.
[00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:06.440]   It's like the Mac Pro all over again, isn't it?
[00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:07.440]   It is.
[00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:08.440]   It's very much like the trash can.
[00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:11.400]   It's kind of a matte finish instead of a shiny black finish.
[00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:14.040]   Yeah, that's the nine, I'm trying to download.
[00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:17.040]   Which is the GarageBand Ableton full length.
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:18.280]   I don't know.
[00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:19.520]   I don't know anything about this.
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:21.320]   What does full length mean?
[00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:22.320]   I don't...
[00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:23.560]   I want the tracks.
[00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:27.880]   I think there's a down under the bottom, there's a non-9-inch nail multi-tracks.
[00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:30.040]   Probably one of those would make sense.
[00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:32.600]   Some of this would make sense.
[00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:34.920]   All right.
[00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:36.320]   All I know is I'm still download.
[00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:37.640]   The download is not very fast.
[00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:41.120]   So I started how to destroy angels adrounding the first...
[00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:47.000]   That's just the very first one on a multi-tracks, the non-inch nails multi-track.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.740]   As you can see, for some reason, I don't know why, maybe because I've got logic running
[00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:50.740]   in the background.
[00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:55.500]   The CPU's been hovering around four gigahertz for something.
[00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:56.500]   Maybe oh, I know what I'm doing.
[00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:59.740]   Downloading all those samples, that's what I'm doing.
[00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:00.740]   But see, it just sits there.
[00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:01.740]   It sits there nice and happy.
[00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:03.300]   I think that's on business.
[00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:06.940]   87 degrees Celsius.
[00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:12.740]   The black line here on the Intel CPU power widget, CPU power widget is the nominal 2.9
[00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:14.580]   gigahertz.
[00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:15.580]   It's well above that.
[00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:17.460]   I'm glad it's plugged in.
[00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:23.740]   I also buy the per recommendation of Apple Insider.
[00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:26.740]   Oh, I can't remember his name.
[00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:29.020]   Who's on a new screensaver, has downloaded a script.
[00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:30.020]   Right, earthly.
[00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:31.020]   Yeah.
[00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:32.020]   Mike Worthley.
[00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:37.740]   I downloaded a set EGPU script because I gather that if you're going to use the EGPU, you
[00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:41.140]   have to run a script to tell programs to use it.
[00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:42.340]   Otherwise they won't.
[00:33:42.340 --> 00:33:46.100]   I mean, it should be supported at the OS level.
[00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:48.940]   Mike probably has looked into it way more than I have, but Apple has built it out so
[00:33:48.940 --> 00:33:52.540]   that you can plug it in, plug it out, and it should just look like it's more GPU.
[00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:53.940]   But it might be that's a map.
[00:33:53.940 --> 00:34:00.100]   He said you won't see it.
[00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:03.140]   So you have to run this.
[00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:05.020]   Apparently in Mojave, it's going to be different.
[00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:06.020]   I don't know.
[00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:07.780]   All right, here's a new project.
[00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:08.780]   This only has this.
[00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:10.900]   Doesn't have very many tracks.
[00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:14.660]   Let me choose an audio track type.
[00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:16.580]   I don't know.
[00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:17.580]   Create.
[00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:18.580]   I don't know.
[00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:25.900]   All right, now let me then take all this stuff and drag it into Logic, see if it takes
[00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:26.900]   it.
[00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:28.660]   No, I won't take it.
[00:34:28.660 --> 00:34:29.780]   These are all Flack files.
[00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:32.180]   I really want to Logic.
[00:34:32.180 --> 00:34:33.740]   I'm too stupid to do this.
[00:34:33.740 --> 00:34:37.940]   I'm just going to stop right now.
[00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:41.700]   I'm the wrong guy to do this.
[00:34:41.700 --> 00:34:43.620]   Anything else one should consider?
[00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:46.140]   There's one thing worth noting.
[00:34:46.140 --> 00:34:48.180]   It was a little bit controversial.
[00:34:48.180 --> 00:34:52.980]   There used to be a service port that you could use to pull data off, if it dies.
[00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:56.660]   But now because there's a T2 architecture, we have this debate often.
[00:34:56.660 --> 00:34:58.620]   There's fail safe versus fail secure.
[00:34:58.620 --> 00:35:01.380]   Previously, it would fail safe and you could pull data off of it.
[00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:02.620]   Now it fails secure.
[00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:09.060]   I far prefer that because basically it's encrypted and you could suck it off, but you
[00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:10.540]   wouldn't be able to look at it.
[00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:11.540]   Yes.
[00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:12.540]   That sounds dirty.
[00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:15.780]   I get that way.
[00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:17.220]   What is Apple who have you to do?
[00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:18.220]   Back it up.
[00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:19.220]   Yes.
[00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:20.220]   Absolutely.
[00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:21.220]   Keep it backed up.
[00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:24.580]   The theory being that if because of all this is a unit, the Logic board failed in the
[00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:28.180]   old days, you could still get the stuff off the SSD.
[00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:30.540]   Now if the Logic board fails, you're out of luck.
[00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:31.540]   Back it up.
[00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:34.380]   I don't have a lot of sympathy for people who don't.
[00:35:34.380 --> 00:35:36.660]   It is one of those design decisions.
[00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:37.660]   It's a good decision.
[00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:38.660]   It's a good decision.
[00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:40.220]   The Apple goes back and forth on it.
[00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:43.340]   I'm always pro security, but I worry that I'm not being mainstream enough that way.
[00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:47.980]   I think that's a good decision because my biggest concern is that somebody will get
[00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:53.700]   a laptop and have it in their possession and then get the data off of it.
[00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:55.060]   This way, I don't have to worry about it.
[00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:59.300]   I turn files on by default on this because of the T2, so it's all encrypted.
[00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:03.020]   I don't have to worry about it, but then you just make a backup.
[00:36:03.020 --> 00:36:09.500]   Anybody who's relying on the service port to save their bacon is really...
[00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:12.300]   It's a closer that kids may never heard what a backup is.
[00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:13.300]   I just feel bad.
[00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:14.300]   Yeah.
[00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:17.140]   Well, I far prefer that this fail secure in this case.
[00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:18.140]   I really don't.
[00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:21.340]   Because there's stuff on this laptop I don't want people to get.
[00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:24.980]   My great American novel and stuff.
[00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:25.980]   Like that.
[00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:27.500]   Aye, a Leo kiss.
[00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:29.020]   All right, let's take a break.
[00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:34.460]   I think what bothered me a little bit is it felt like piling on.
[00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:38.820]   And I felt like because of Dave Lee's video, everybody and their brother now had an opinion
[00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:40.420]   on Throttlegate.
[00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:44.340]   Maybe that's because I read all the Reddit MacBook Pro Reddit threads.
[00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:45.940]   I mean, there is this thing like...
[00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:47.100]   And it's not just Apple.
[00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:50.340]   There's this thing where we believe that every company is filled with idiots.
[00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:52.020]   You know, Intel has no idea what they're...
[00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:54.100]   Fair enough, Spectre and things like that.
[00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:57.620]   There are problems once in a while, but that Apple and Microsoft and Google and Intel
[00:36:57.620 --> 00:36:59.380]   and all these companies are filled with idiots.
[00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:02.420]   And if they just did what we think on the internet, it'd be great.
[00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:06.060]   And I had a friend who was so much like that and then went to work for Apple.
[00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:08.780]   And he's like, "I learned on the internet how to fix all your problems."
[00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:10.300]   And they're like, "Here's the file.
[00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:12.180]   We tried it the first time and this is the problem that caused."
[00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:15.940]   Second, none of these things are as simple as we imagine them when they're not our responsibility.
[00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:16.940]   Yeah.
[00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:18.740]   And I think that's a lesson that's going to take a long time to learn.
[00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:22.020]   Do you think Apple made the right choice?
[00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:26.660]   You mean in terms of the third-rate sign of it?
[00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:27.660]   Yeah.
[00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:31.860]   I think Apple makes a very specific product that's very in tune to their brand and they
[00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:34.340]   want to make one version that scales to the millions.
[00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:35.580]   They could change the way they operate.
[00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:39.300]   They could become like Dell, but they would not be Apple anymore.
[00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:42.620]   And Apple has great characteristics and incredibly frustrating ones.
[00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:44.580]   But one of them is they make very, very few products.
[00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:47.180]   So those products are very, very similar.
[00:37:47.180 --> 00:37:49.900]   And this was nice, cheap.
[00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:54.100]   You have a good, nice, sorry, good, cheaper fast and you can only pick two of them.
[00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:57.220]   They could have done a new design, but that's just not the way that Apple operates.
[00:37:57.220 --> 00:38:00.460]   So this was the best they could do with what they had.
[00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:01.460]   Yeah.
[00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:03.420]   Sorry, Andy, I think I cut you off.
[00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:09.220]   No, no, I was just going to button by saying that once again, this is why early adopters,
[00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:13.620]   you really got to have a great reason to buy the first, not just the first version, but
[00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:14.820]   the first week.
[00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:19.260]   It's not until even if you just wait a month, you will at least find out what the little
[00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:20.700]   problems are going to be.
[00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:22.060]   I'm not even talking about defects.
[00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:27.700]   I'm talking about yours, change your decisions that Apple made that might affect you.
[00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:30.980]   The differences between this version and the version that you have right now.
[00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:35.660]   And if that's going to be a deal breaker, you'll at least go in spending $7,000 or even just
[00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:41.620]   $2,000 a lot smarter than you would have just said, ooh, new shiny thing must buy.
[00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:45.900]   But I will also say anytime you buy the first generation of anything from Apple, that is
[00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:49.820]   a good excuse to pop the extra money for Apple care.
[00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:54.940]   Because there's probably going to be what we've a missed it, we call, let's say, edge
[00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:55.940]   cases.
[00:38:55.940 --> 00:39:00.940]   The day after warranty, like a keyboard fails or the day after warranty.
[00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:05.420]   There's a dead pixel or an illumination thing that Apple doesn't think is a warranty issue.
[00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:10.500]   Again, it takes a while for every company to figure out exactly how to manufacture these
[00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:11.500]   things.
[00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:14.660]   And so that's what I would definitely buy the Apple care.
[00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:20.460]   And I would say I buy Apple care every time.
[00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:22.260]   I don't ever not buy it.
[00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:27.860]   I don't buy any other care, but the Apple one generally, it's low stress, they stand
[00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:29.140]   behind it.
[00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:31.980]   We've used it a lot.
[00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:34.860]   So we run our computers pretty hard.
[00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:36.340]   And so we've had a lot of experience.
[00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:40.940]   And we won't even get Apple care from Amazon or from AT&T if we bought it from them or
[00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:41.940]   whatever.
[00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:47.260]   We'll only get Apple care from Apple because otherwise, when you buy it at an Apple store,
[00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:49.580]   they just connect it to your account immediately.
[00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:52.340]   And there's no other paperwork and there's nothing else you forgot to do.
[00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:55.140]   And all the other stuff that happens that doesn't work.
[00:39:55.140 --> 00:40:00.260]   We've gone down that path with Apple care from third party vendors.
[00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:06.540]   But I would say I would always get it because it's one of the few services like this that
[00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:07.900]   are worth it.
[00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:12.500]   And this is going to be the answer to your problem, Alex.
[00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:13.580]   This is from line.
[00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:18.140]   This is a magnetic MagSafe type C adapter.
[00:40:18.140 --> 00:40:19.140]   I know.
[00:40:19.140 --> 00:40:24.580]   Every time I mention how much I hate that doesn't have a MagSafe, I get emails.
[00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:25.580]   I get tweets.
[00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:30.740]   I get Facebook connections of all the different options that are ought to put that in.
[00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:34.820]   The problem that I have is that my computer goes through a lot of bags and a lot of bits
[00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:35.820]   and pieces.
[00:40:35.820 --> 00:40:39.500]   And what really worries me is a nub sticking out, like a little piece sticking out of that
[00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:40.500]   seat port.
[00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:44.580]   What I'm afraid of is it's going to get hit and it's going to get bent.
[00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:51.100]   And so that's the concern that I have with all of, there's a bunch of companies make
[00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:55.100]   USB-C to MagSafe.
[00:40:55.100 --> 00:40:59.620]   And if I liked it being flush, I kind of still want it to be flush.
[00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:01.220]   But I'll eventually have to give in.
[00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:02.220]   I know.
[00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:06.660]   So far, I've been able to hold up.
[00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:09.380]   All right.
[00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:13.100]   Let us take a little break to talk about this.
[00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:17.900]   I'm standing up to show you my belt.
[00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:19.980]   It says, "Twit."
[00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:26.380]   And the cool thing about this belt, look at this, actually listen to this.
[00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:29.980]   Because when I cinch it up, you hear that?
[00:41:29.980 --> 00:41:31.460]   You hear the little clicks?
[00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:35.620]   Let me do that again.
[00:41:35.620 --> 00:41:38.380]   That is my slide belt.
[00:41:38.380 --> 00:41:39.380]   That is awesome.
[00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:46.300]   Instead of having to punch holes in the leather, this belt adjusts virtually infinitely.
[00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:54.740]   I love these slide belts, brand new sponsor on the show, slidebeltswithness.com/twit.
[00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:55.820]   We're going to give you a good deal.
[00:41:55.820 --> 00:42:00.100]   Let me just show you some of the different things you could do with the slide belt.
[00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:02.580]   One of the fun things when the slide, here's the twit one.
[00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:08.780]   One of the things when the slide belt comes, it comes kind of one size fits all.
[00:42:08.780 --> 00:42:11.820]   Because you get the leather, or they have leather, they have canvas, they have vegan
[00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:14.060]   leather, they have a lot of different colors and styles.
[00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:15.460]   Here is another Twit buckle boy.
[00:42:15.460 --> 00:42:17.860]   I love that.
[00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:20.700]   First you cut this to whatever size you want.
[00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:22.900]   They've got markings on the inside.
[00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:25.740]   I don't know if you can see those on the camera.
[00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:28.700]   But you've set it to the size you want and you just cut it off.
[00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:30.180]   And then on the other side is the ratchet.
[00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:32.620]   And then this is the key on the slide belt.
[00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:37.060]   So you're going to insert the slide belt leather into here, lock it down.
[00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:38.060]   That's what I did.
[00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:43.860]   And then I'll do the ratcheting from the other side so you can hear it happen here.
[00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:49.020]   When you put on your belt, you just put that in there and it ratchets closed.
[00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:51.460]   It's going to fit exactly what you want.
[00:42:51.460 --> 00:42:54.500]   To release it, you just lift the belt.
[00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:56.540]   This is such an awesome belt.
[00:42:56.540 --> 00:43:00.060]   I want you to visit slidebelts.com/twit.
[00:43:00.060 --> 00:43:02.620]   Use the offer code TWIT.
[00:43:02.620 --> 00:43:05.180]   You'll get 20% off.
[00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:07.460]   I can't believe I never heard about these before.
[00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:09.780]   It really is a very cool thing.
[00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:13.420]   They made me realize how I stopped wearing belts because I couldn't get a belt that
[00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:14.420]   fit just right.
[00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:16.740]   It's either too tight or too loose.
[00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:18.380]   Slide belt fits even.
[00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:20.420]   You know, it's great.
[00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:25.300]   After a nice barbecue or maybe a large meal somewhere, you just notch a two and it's
[00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:26.300]   right there.
[00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:27.300]   It fits perfectly.
[00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:28.300]   They don't have holes.
[00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:31.620]   They use this patented ratchet design that adjusts precisely to you.
[00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:33.460]   32 adjustments.
[00:43:33.460 --> 00:43:35.940]   That makes it more comfortable no matter what your situation.
[00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:38.340]   And look at all the different kinds of straps.
[00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:43.620]   Low grain and top grain leathers, to high quality canvas, animal friendly vegan.
[00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:45.140]   Josh loves that.
[00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:49.100]   They can be worn casually around the house at the office for date night.
[00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:54.260]   And if you're still not convinced a one year warranty, free exchanges and no hassle returns.
[00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:58.340]   But I'm going to show you one more thing that makes me love the slide belt.
[00:43:58.340 --> 00:44:02.820]   This is the slide belt survival buckle.
[00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:04.020]   Get ready.
[00:44:04.020 --> 00:44:05.940]   Get ready for adventure kids.
[00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:09.380]   This buckle has everything.
[00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:12.700]   If I can get it out of here, it looks like a regular buckle.
[00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:17.180]   But inside the survival buckle, you could show it on the show it on the website.
[00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:18.940]   You're probably able to see it better.
[00:44:18.940 --> 00:44:21.020]   There's a knife and you'll like this.
[00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:22.020]   Look at this.
[00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:24.340]   That's like Indiana Jones's belt.
[00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:25.340]   This is so awesome.
[00:44:25.340 --> 00:44:26.340]   Look at this.
[00:44:26.340 --> 00:44:29.140]   You could show you show mine show mind just so I could show you the knife just slides out
[00:44:29.140 --> 00:44:30.140]   like that.
[00:44:30.140 --> 00:44:31.140]   Look at that.
[00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:32.140]   Ooh and it's sharp.
[00:44:32.140 --> 00:44:33.140]   By the way, be careful.
[00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:34.140]   There's a quote.
[00:44:34.140 --> 00:44:35.140]   There's a knife.
[00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:36.140]   You'll like this.
[00:44:36.140 --> 00:44:40.940]   Well, it goes with all your other utility stuff, right?
[00:44:40.940 --> 00:44:44.540]   There's like Alton Brown, uni taskers are a problem.
[00:44:44.540 --> 00:44:46.060]   It's like to have.
[00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:47.500]   This is for lighting fires.
[00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:49.100]   Okay, it's got a tinder.
[00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:50.820]   It's got a little flashlight on the other end.
[00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:53.140]   A flashlight on your belt buckle.
[00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:55.540]   Now I think about this belt.
[00:44:55.540 --> 00:44:59.060]   This is the best belt buckle ever.
[00:44:59.060 --> 00:45:00.220]   Church key you bet.
[00:45:00.220 --> 00:45:01.220]   You never know.
[00:45:01.220 --> 00:45:03.300]   You might have to open a beer or pop.
[00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:04.300]   This is an Australian belt.
[00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:06.460]   It's got a nice kind of beer opener.
[00:45:06.460 --> 00:45:07.780]   Awesome.
[00:45:07.780 --> 00:45:10.620]   That's the survival belt 2.0.
[00:45:10.620 --> 00:45:12.380]   You choose, of course, the material.
[00:45:12.380 --> 00:45:13.380]   You cut it to size.
[00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:14.380]   You stick it in there.
[00:45:14.380 --> 00:45:15.380]   It really works, by the way.
[00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:19.260]   I know people probably look at me when I say this, but it really does a full grip.
[00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:22.020]   And if you lose weight, this belt, you can adjust it.
[00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:23.260]   Cut off a little more leather.
[00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:25.420]   You'll feel good about yourself.
[00:45:25.420 --> 00:45:26.980]   The survival belt 2.0.
[00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:30.980]   Just one of many styles of slide belts.
[00:45:30.980 --> 00:45:33.540]   If you're ready for a better belt, I know I was.
[00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:34.540]   Look at that.
[00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:37.180]   You can open your Mexican cola with it.
[00:45:37.180 --> 00:45:38.420]   Now how much would you pay?
[00:45:38.420 --> 00:45:41.580]   Look at that flashlight on your belt.
[00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:44.980]   Just this morning when I was getting dressed, I reflected on the fact that I've owned this.
[00:45:44.980 --> 00:45:48.980]   I own only one belt and it's been the same belt for like 20 years.
[00:45:48.980 --> 00:45:49.980]   Look at that.
[00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:50.980]   Start a fire.
[00:45:50.980 --> 00:45:52.980]   This might have to be number two.
[00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:54.820]   I'm sending you a slide belt right now.
[00:45:54.820 --> 00:45:55.820]   Don't buy one.
[00:45:55.820 --> 00:45:57.660]   I'll send you one, Andy.
[00:45:57.660 --> 00:46:02.740]   I will send you the one with the utility kit right on the belt buckle.
[00:46:02.740 --> 00:46:03.740]   You want one too?
[00:46:03.740 --> 00:46:05.500]   I think this might be a week.
[00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:08.780]   You get a slide belt and you get a slide belt and you get a slide belt.
[00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:09.780]   It's awesome.
[00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:10.780]   It's awesome.
[00:46:10.780 --> 00:46:11.780]   Isn't it awesome?
[00:46:11.780 --> 00:46:12.780]   Yeah.
[00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:16.180]   Because when they said, okay, we're going to, because I've never heard about it and they
[00:46:16.180 --> 00:46:17.700]   sent us and I said, oh, these are great.
[00:46:17.700 --> 00:46:20.060]   Yeah, we'll do an ad.
[00:46:20.060 --> 00:46:21.500]   They said, okay, we're sending you a belt.
[00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:27.380]   I said, but you have to send me the utility belt because that's the survival belt.
[00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:33.700]   That's a whole new view on the old belt and suspenders level of being prepared.
[00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:35.700]   Oh, man.
[00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:36.700]   Slidebelts.com/tuit.
[00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:38.500]   Oh, I've just been handed.
[00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:39.740]   My pick of the week.
[00:46:39.740 --> 00:46:41.940]   Finally, thank you so much.
[00:46:41.940 --> 00:46:43.500]   Thank you.
[00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:44.500]   My pick of the week came.
[00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:46.180]   I'll show you that later.
[00:46:46.180 --> 00:46:47.180]   History.
[00:46:47.180 --> 00:46:48.820]   It's not the EGPU.
[00:46:48.820 --> 00:46:49.820]   It's a slide belt.
[00:46:49.820 --> 00:46:50.820]   No.
[00:46:50.820 --> 00:46:55.300]   Slidebelts.com/tuit for 20% off when you use your offer code "tuit."
[00:46:55.300 --> 00:46:57.620]   That is a very, very good deal.
[00:46:57.620 --> 00:47:00.660]   30 bucks off the survival belt.
[00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:02.060]   Survival 2.0.
[00:47:02.060 --> 00:47:04.300]   And you can't get it engraved, so you can get anything on it.
[00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:08.060]   This would be, you know, I think for a wedding for Grimsman's gift or whatever, wouldn't
[00:47:08.060 --> 00:47:09.060]   that be cool?
[00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:10.060]   Oh, yeah.
[00:47:10.060 --> 00:47:11.300]   How did one's survival belt?
[00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:12.700]   You don't have to say "tuit."
[00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:15.500]   No, I think they're perfect for the wedding.
[00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:17.860]   Well, I think everybody should have a tuit on their belt.
[00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:24.620]   If you want a better belt, go to slidebelts.com/tuit and use the code "tuit" for 20% off.
[00:47:24.620 --> 00:47:26.620]   I love my tuit belt.
[00:47:26.620 --> 00:47:27.620]   All right.
[00:47:27.620 --> 00:47:28.620]   So many show titles.
[00:47:28.620 --> 00:47:33.340]   So many show titles today.
[00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:37.780]   Somebody said I should load the demo in Logic Pro 10.
[00:47:37.780 --> 00:47:39.260]   I don't know.
[00:47:39.260 --> 00:47:42.660]   And by the way, the very first one on that web page I did download and open in Logic,
[00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:43.660]   but it's not very big.
[00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:45.660]   Those 9-inch nail ones are not big ones.
[00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:47.260]   They are, by the way, a...
[00:47:47.260 --> 00:47:48.260]   If you haven't...
[00:47:48.260 --> 00:47:49.260]   You know, this happened...
[00:47:49.260 --> 00:47:50.260]   Oh, it's so cool.
[00:47:50.260 --> 00:47:55.300]   I think it is a master's class in developing a...
[00:47:55.300 --> 00:47:59.600]   You should definitely search 9-inch nails garage band and you'll get to this these 9-inch
[00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:01.340]   nail multi-track downloads.
[00:48:01.340 --> 00:48:03.940]   And there's a whole bunch of songs in there.
[00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:07.700]   And whether you like 9-inch nails or not, I'm a huge fan, so it's easy for me.
[00:48:07.700 --> 00:48:14.300]   But just watching how a professional puts that all together, and I think that these
[00:48:14.300 --> 00:48:15.300]   were all bounce-down approachals.
[00:48:15.300 --> 00:48:16.300]   I think they actually put them together.
[00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:21.020]   They're approachals originally back in 2005.
[00:48:21.020 --> 00:48:25.300]   But if you're trying to think about how do I put together a song, this is just a great
[00:48:25.300 --> 00:48:29.300]   way to break down what they're doing with each piece and how they bring it all in one
[00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:30.300]   piece at a time.
[00:48:30.300 --> 00:48:31.540]   And it's fantastic.
[00:48:31.540 --> 00:48:33.740]   So we haven't talked about it for...
[00:48:33.740 --> 00:48:36.020]   You know, since it came out, I think, a long, long ago.
[00:48:36.020 --> 00:48:37.020]   Oh, it's so great.
[00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:41.060]   But it's so worth downloading and playing with in garage band even.
[00:48:41.060 --> 00:48:43.380]   The first one is in garage band format.
[00:48:43.380 --> 00:48:47.340]   You can open up in garage band and see that you could use garage band to make a song.
[00:48:47.340 --> 00:48:51.860]   Well, what happened was my son did a bunch of beats on garage band when he was in high
[00:48:51.860 --> 00:48:53.780]   school, loved it so much.
[00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:54.860]   Logic Pro is inexpensive.
[00:48:54.860 --> 00:48:57.300]   I ended up getting him logic.
[00:48:57.300 --> 00:48:58.300]   And he just...
[00:48:58.300 --> 00:48:59.300]   I mean, he flipped his lid.
[00:48:59.300 --> 00:49:00.300]   He loved it.
[00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:01.300]   Yeah.
[00:49:01.300 --> 00:49:02.300]   It really...
[00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:03.300]   I'm trying to decide when.
[00:49:03.300 --> 00:49:04.300]   My kids went to...
[00:49:04.300 --> 00:49:07.420]   They went to one garage band class at an Apple store.
[00:49:07.420 --> 00:49:08.420]   And they came back.
[00:49:08.420 --> 00:49:10.300]   They came back and they were playing this music.
[00:49:10.300 --> 00:49:11.660]   I'm like, "Oh, who's this?"
[00:49:11.660 --> 00:49:13.140]   And Bella was like, "Me."
[00:49:13.140 --> 00:49:14.140]   Isn't that awesome?
[00:49:14.140 --> 00:49:15.140]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:49:15.140 --> 00:49:20.060]   And it sounded completely like a track that you'd hear on the radio.
[00:49:20.060 --> 00:49:24.460]   And she threw it together in a class at the Apple store.
[00:49:24.460 --> 00:49:26.460]   You know, so it's...
[00:49:26.460 --> 00:49:27.860]   By the way, those classes are pretty good too.
[00:49:27.860 --> 00:49:31.740]   Because my kids, that's all they want to do when they're grandparents.
[00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:35.780]   I guess they live near an Apple store and they go often to the Apple store.
[00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:38.260]   I think it's something for grandma to give them to do.
[00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:39.500]   So they spend hours there.
[00:49:39.500 --> 00:49:43.740]   So I'm going to go to the channel strip settings, E-XS factory samples, plug-in sampler instruments,
[00:49:43.740 --> 00:49:44.740]   ultra beat samples.
[00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:47.380]   I know these are all looks like samples.
[00:49:47.380 --> 00:49:50.220]   I'm looking for the demo.
[00:49:50.220 --> 00:49:52.340]   Oh well.
[00:49:52.340 --> 00:49:55.220]   Library application support, Logic Pro demo songs.
[00:49:55.220 --> 00:49:57.980]   It's not there anymore, I guess.
[00:49:57.980 --> 00:50:00.820]   Oddly enough.
[00:50:00.820 --> 00:50:04.020]   Maybe it's under my name.
[00:50:04.020 --> 00:50:07.300]   Let me see if it's under my name.
[00:50:07.300 --> 00:50:10.180]   I could send you one of my podcasts to editing files.
[00:50:10.180 --> 00:50:15.260]   Usually it has at least 92 tracks, 90 of which are completely unnecessary.
[00:50:15.260 --> 00:50:20.660]   Don't call a roughness track so it's necessary.
[00:50:20.660 --> 00:50:22.060]   You don't use garage band for that.
[00:50:22.060 --> 00:50:24.660]   You should use garage band for that.
[00:50:24.660 --> 00:50:25.660]   I'm just really...
[00:50:25.660 --> 00:50:30.260]   I'm very good at taking a pro app that I don't actually need and then making things way to
[00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:31.260]   come to get a specialty.
[00:50:31.260 --> 00:50:35.620]   Also, as a pride of Adelaide, he needs all those tracks.
[00:50:35.620 --> 00:50:38.780]   That's what he had to go.
[00:50:38.780 --> 00:50:43.340]   We let him write his own press release and claim that his company was being bought out
[00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:48.140]   by public radio, but really now the truth can be told.
[00:50:48.140 --> 00:50:54.500]   Please don't go work for Apple.
[00:50:54.500 --> 00:50:56.260]   Can I just say that while we're waiting?
[00:50:56.260 --> 00:50:57.260]   Wait a minute.
[00:50:57.260 --> 00:50:58.940]   Serenity Caldwell wants to work for Apple.
[00:50:58.940 --> 00:50:59.940]   Yeah.
[00:50:59.940 --> 00:51:00.940]   What is she doing?
[00:51:00.940 --> 00:51:03.260]   She's on the internal comms team.
[00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:04.260]   Good for her.
[00:51:04.260 --> 00:51:05.260]   Yeah.
[00:51:05.260 --> 00:51:07.100]   I'm sorry for your loss.
[00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:08.100]   I know.
[00:51:08.100 --> 00:51:09.100]   Our losses.
[00:51:09.100 --> 00:51:10.100]   Yeah.
[00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:15.340]   Then they took Alie, then they took Guy English, then they took Serenity Caldwell.
[00:51:15.340 --> 00:51:19.860]   No, I really want to be hired by Apple because that's the only way now to get my eyes on
[00:51:19.860 --> 00:51:22.060]   like Serenity Caldwell crowd.
[00:51:22.060 --> 00:51:23.860]   Serenity produced content.
[00:51:23.860 --> 00:51:25.260]   I know, right?
[00:51:25.260 --> 00:51:28.700]   Is she going to move back to Cupertino?
[00:51:28.700 --> 00:51:29.700]   She did.
[00:51:29.700 --> 00:51:31.860]   She moved like two weeks ago.
[00:51:31.860 --> 00:51:32.860]   No more Boston.
[00:51:32.860 --> 00:51:35.180]   I don't think we have roller derby out here.
[00:51:35.180 --> 00:51:36.180]   Yeah.
[00:51:36.180 --> 00:51:37.860]   You have a couple of really good teams.
[00:51:37.860 --> 00:51:41.420]   She said, and I wouldn't be surprised if she created one right in South Bay.
[00:51:41.420 --> 00:51:45.140]   I feel there is one already, but it feels like a lot of those Apple.
[00:51:45.140 --> 00:51:48.180]   It wouldn't be surprised if watch suddenly got a lot of roller derby workouts.
[00:51:48.180 --> 00:51:49.980]   I'm just going to say.
[00:51:49.980 --> 00:51:52.180]   I'm just saying, Andy, I can take.
[00:51:52.180 --> 00:51:53.180]   You could pass the baton.
[00:51:53.180 --> 00:51:56.100]   I will take the roller derby pictures out here.
[00:51:56.100 --> 00:51:57.100]   No.
[00:51:57.100 --> 00:51:58.100]   No, I'll see.
[00:51:58.100 --> 00:52:01.780]   You'll take the Serenity team's pictures.
[00:52:01.780 --> 00:52:05.340]   I'll continue to take shots of Providence roller derby.
[00:52:05.340 --> 00:52:07.580]   Another bout Saturday and War Fund.
[00:52:07.580 --> 00:52:09.980]   Anybody who was in the New England area.
[00:52:09.980 --> 00:52:11.580]   We'll just document on.
[00:52:11.580 --> 00:52:12.900]   You'll be the East Coast.
[00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:14.660]   You'll be the West Coast.
[00:52:14.660 --> 00:52:15.660]   Okay.
[00:52:15.660 --> 00:52:16.740]   Congratulations, Ray.
[00:52:16.740 --> 00:52:20.460]   And actually, I had, we had employees stolen by Apple as well, didn't we?
[00:52:20.460 --> 00:52:24.140]   Nathan Oliveris Giles was stolen away from us by Apple.
[00:52:24.140 --> 00:52:25.140]   They take all the best.
[00:52:25.140 --> 00:52:26.140]   They went on us free.
[00:52:26.140 --> 00:52:27.140]   I know.
[00:52:27.140 --> 00:52:28.980]   It took a bunch of Mackerel people, a bunch of Anantec people.
[00:52:28.980 --> 00:52:30.500]   Yeah, Anand is working there, right?
[00:52:30.500 --> 00:52:32.540]   But I don't see what the problem is.
[00:52:32.540 --> 00:52:35.580]   All these people go there and then they disappear from public view.
[00:52:35.580 --> 00:52:36.580]   Yeah.
[00:52:36.580 --> 00:52:37.580]   Where is Anand?
[00:52:37.580 --> 00:52:38.580]   What is he doing?
[00:52:38.580 --> 00:52:40.140]   I mean, what's his name?
[00:52:40.140 --> 00:52:44.020]   Steve, the head of Apple PR was, I think, from CNBC.
[00:52:44.020 --> 00:52:45.020]   Right.
[00:52:45.020 --> 00:52:46.020]   He was.
[00:52:46.020 --> 00:52:47.020]   Yeah.
[00:52:47.020 --> 00:52:48.020]   Yeah.
[00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:49.020]   At least he has a public face.
[00:52:49.020 --> 00:52:57.060]   I think that a lot of people are working on unknown projects, future projects.
[00:52:57.060 --> 00:53:00.940]   Yeah, serenity suddenly stops driving her car.
[00:53:00.940 --> 00:53:02.860]   Or if we hear her from near Earth orbit.
[00:53:02.860 --> 00:53:03.860]   Yeah.
[00:53:03.860 --> 00:53:04.860]   That's it.
[00:53:04.860 --> 00:53:09.020]   But seriously, I'm not even joking when I say that serenity working inside Apple is
[00:53:09.020 --> 00:53:10.860]   going to improve all of us.
[00:53:10.860 --> 00:53:16.300]   All Apple products because she's not working on like iMovie and the iPhone, but she will
[00:53:16.300 --> 00:53:21.300]   be the person saying, "Hey, I tried to, your motion tracking works okay when you're motion
[00:53:21.300 --> 00:53:25.540]   tracking a car that's driving at 35 miles an hour, but when you've got a jammer, that's
[00:53:25.540 --> 00:53:29.780]   in the middle of a jammer block, people in there, you need to make this better."
[00:53:29.780 --> 00:53:30.780]   Wow.
[00:53:30.780 --> 00:53:33.300]   Anyway, she'll be missed.
[00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:35.660]   Lori Gildo has stepped up and she is now in the video.
[00:53:35.660 --> 00:53:36.660]   It's not that I'm wearing.
[00:53:36.660 --> 00:53:37.660]   She's terrific.
[00:53:37.660 --> 00:53:38.660]   She is awesome.
[00:53:38.660 --> 00:53:39.660]   We love Lori.
[00:53:39.660 --> 00:53:42.540]   So I'm glad that your loss is Lori's win.
[00:53:42.540 --> 00:53:43.780]   That's fantastic.
[00:53:43.780 --> 00:53:44.980]   We think she might have arranged this.
[00:53:44.980 --> 00:53:47.100]   She has her whole Game of Thrones motif going on.
[00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:49.740]   We're not quite sure of the details.
[00:53:49.740 --> 00:53:55.180]   By the way, I was going to put this Meg safe adapter on, but I realized that it's going
[00:53:55.180 --> 00:54:01.420]   through the eGPU and one tip on the eGPU, which you'll learn quickly, you have to disconnect
[00:54:01.420 --> 00:54:02.420]   it.
[00:54:02.420 --> 00:54:03.420]   Manual.
[00:54:03.420 --> 00:54:04.420]   I mean, you can't just unplug it.
[00:54:04.420 --> 00:54:06.260]   You have to unmount it first.
[00:54:06.260 --> 00:54:08.660]   Do you know why that is?
[00:54:08.660 --> 00:54:11.220]   Joan, I think.
[00:54:11.220 --> 00:54:15.020]   Someone made that whole comment about, "Can you just pull out discs?"
[00:54:15.020 --> 00:54:18.540]   And everyone's like, "Maybe, but never do that just in case."
[00:54:18.540 --> 00:54:19.460]   Oh, it's interesting.
[00:54:19.460 --> 00:54:23.020]   It closed a bunch of programs.
[00:54:23.020 --> 00:54:24.020]   Do I have to reboot?
[00:54:24.020 --> 00:54:25.020]   Oh, yes.
[00:54:25.020 --> 00:54:26.020]   Okay.
[00:54:26.020 --> 00:54:31.540]   Oh, in order to do this, you have to terminate including us, apparently.
[00:54:31.540 --> 00:54:33.100]   Closed you too.
[00:54:33.100 --> 00:54:35.020]   Everything has gone black.
[00:54:35.020 --> 00:54:37.060]   Holy cow.
[00:54:37.060 --> 00:54:38.060]   This was...
[00:54:38.060 --> 00:54:40.060]   I don't know what's happening.
[00:54:40.060 --> 00:54:41.060]   What's happening?
[00:54:41.060 --> 00:54:43.300]   Listen how quiet the fans are.
[00:54:43.300 --> 00:54:44.820]   It's so quiet.
[00:54:44.820 --> 00:54:47.140]   So I guess in order to...
[00:54:47.140 --> 00:54:52.300]   Because things are using the eGPU, in order to disconnect it, it really has to shut things
[00:54:52.300 --> 00:54:53.300]   down.
[00:54:53.300 --> 00:54:55.100]   It restarted the power gadget.
[00:54:55.100 --> 00:54:57.140]   It restarted logic.
[00:54:57.140 --> 00:54:58.140]   That makes sense.
[00:54:58.140 --> 00:55:03.340]   Well, this was the fundamental issue that Apple had with NVIDIA is that Apple wanted
[00:55:03.340 --> 00:55:07.420]   control over those drivers because so much of the operating system and so much of what
[00:55:07.420 --> 00:55:12.060]   they build is sitting on top of the GPU and they wanted control and NVIDIA didn't want
[00:55:12.060 --> 00:55:13.060]   to give it to them.
[00:55:13.060 --> 00:55:14.060]   Yeah.
[00:55:14.060 --> 00:55:16.860]   And ATI saw the business opportunity and it was a chore.
[00:55:16.860 --> 00:55:18.540]   You know, go ahead.
[00:55:18.540 --> 00:55:20.220]   But I think that that has been the fundamental thing.
[00:55:20.220 --> 00:55:22.500]   NVIDIA wants to get the highest performance out of their cards.
[00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:29.340]   Apple needs the most stability and those two things don't necessarily line up directly
[00:55:29.340 --> 00:55:30.820]   having the control that they need.
[00:55:30.820 --> 00:55:34.660]   But you can see right there, that's a good example of why Apple didn't want to...
[00:55:34.660 --> 00:55:36.740]   Wants to have complete control over how that works.
[00:55:36.740 --> 00:55:39.300]   And I think in general, I find...
[00:55:39.300 --> 00:55:40.780]   I am plugged drives all the time.
[00:55:40.780 --> 00:55:41.780]   That doesn't bother me.
[00:55:41.780 --> 00:55:45.140]   But I will say that we're very careful when you have...
[00:55:45.140 --> 00:55:50.180]   If you still have a firewire connection, the firewire is a little sad.
[00:55:50.180 --> 00:55:52.220]   It's sensitive to being plugged and unplugged.
[00:55:52.220 --> 00:55:56.460]   And not so much the firewire, but the SATA connectors.
[00:55:56.460 --> 00:56:00.780]   So what we did find is that about 10% of the time if you take a SATA connector and just
[00:56:00.780 --> 00:56:05.180]   plug it right into a SATA drive while the firewire is still plugged into the computer,
[00:56:05.180 --> 00:56:08.980]   about 10% of the time your firewire port will never work again.
[00:56:08.980 --> 00:56:15.140]   And I do remember the Surface Book, Microsoft Surface Book, which had a dedicated GPU in
[00:56:15.140 --> 00:56:21.260]   the keyboard for a year and a half if you just disconnected the tablet part from the
[00:56:21.260 --> 00:56:24.300]   keyboard, it just was a nightmare.
[00:56:24.300 --> 00:56:25.980]   So it is non-trivial.
[00:56:25.980 --> 00:56:28.940]   So I did find there is a demo song.
[00:56:28.940 --> 00:56:31.180]   It's a Beck song.
[00:56:31.180 --> 00:56:32.180]   I don't know.
[00:56:32.180 --> 00:56:34.020]   Does this look like it has enough?
[00:56:34.020 --> 00:56:35.260]   Do you not see me?
[00:56:35.260 --> 00:56:37.260]   Do I need to...
[00:56:37.260 --> 00:56:38.260]   I wonder if I...
[00:56:38.260 --> 00:56:40.780]   How do you signal that the G-E-G-P was plugged in?
[00:56:40.780 --> 00:56:41.780]   I don't know.
[00:56:41.780 --> 00:56:43.180]   Let me plug it in again.
[00:56:43.180 --> 00:56:48.180]   Well, it says "not charging", but that means it's...
[00:56:48.180 --> 00:56:53.100]   Oh, you know, I wonder if this MagSafe thing broke it.
[00:56:53.100 --> 00:56:54.740]   Oh, interesting.
[00:56:54.740 --> 00:56:55.740]   It shouldn't.
[00:56:55.740 --> 00:56:58.740]   Is it just power or is it power and data?
[00:56:58.740 --> 00:57:00.260]   Maybe it's not data.
[00:57:00.260 --> 00:57:01.260]   Let's...
[00:57:01.260 --> 00:57:04.700]   USB-C, as much as it is one thing, it's so confusing.
[00:57:04.700 --> 00:57:05.700]   It's so confusing.
[00:57:05.700 --> 00:57:07.580]   Let's just plug in directly.
[00:57:07.580 --> 00:57:11.380]   Now I've lost all functionality.
[00:57:11.380 --> 00:57:12.380]   The mouse won't move.
[00:57:12.380 --> 00:57:13.380]   Everything's happening.
[00:57:13.380 --> 00:57:14.580]   It's like a YouTube video.
[00:57:14.580 --> 00:57:17.180]   It's moving so fast, you can't keep up with it.
[00:57:17.180 --> 00:57:18.180]   You're only distracted.
[00:57:18.180 --> 00:57:20.380]   You're gonna slow it down.
[00:57:20.380 --> 00:57:21.380]   Oh, crud.
[00:57:21.380 --> 00:57:22.940]   Oh, crud.
[00:57:22.940 --> 00:57:25.380]   I shouldn't have done that, should I?
[00:57:25.380 --> 00:57:26.900]   Oh, you got in the pot.
[00:57:26.900 --> 00:57:28.740]   I broke it.
[00:57:28.740 --> 00:57:31.100]   Man, I can't get this thing out.
[00:57:31.100 --> 00:57:33.060]   Oh, man.
[00:57:33.060 --> 00:57:37.980]   There's just no vector for happiness in 2018.
[00:57:37.980 --> 00:57:41.380]   Let me close everything by force quitting.
[00:57:41.380 --> 00:57:42.380]   You can't have...
[00:57:42.380 --> 00:57:47.940]   Even if the strawberries are not nearly so sweet nor so ripe in 2018, as they were.
[00:57:47.940 --> 00:57:53.460]   Many of these apparently, USB Type-C MagSafes do not transmit full power, SiskudirX.
[00:57:53.460 --> 00:57:54.700]   I don't even think it's full power.
[00:57:54.700 --> 00:57:58.260]   I think it didn't transmit a lot of things.
[00:57:58.260 --> 00:58:05.260]   Like your desire for a working mag.
[00:58:05.260 --> 00:58:06.780]   Now it's all dead.
[00:58:06.780 --> 00:58:08.300]   I think I broke it.
[00:58:08.300 --> 00:58:09.540]   Oh, man.
[00:58:09.540 --> 00:58:11.260]   Oh, man.
[00:58:11.260 --> 00:58:15.100]   Okay, but hey, if you're the first one for this to happen to, you get to decide what
[00:58:15.100 --> 00:58:16.940]   kind of gate it is.
[00:58:16.940 --> 00:58:20.540]   It's ETPU gate.
[00:58:20.540 --> 00:58:21.540]   E gate.
[00:58:21.540 --> 00:58:25.940]   A lot of persnickety people on YouTube are waiting for your response so they can start
[00:58:25.940 --> 00:58:27.380]   making videos about it.
[00:58:27.380 --> 00:58:28.820]   And Reddit, don't forget Reddit.
[00:58:28.820 --> 00:58:29.820]   They got you.
[00:58:29.820 --> 00:58:33.500]   I've been looking for something to talk about on Reddit.
[00:58:33.500 --> 00:58:36.340]   Now that Thanos has killed me.
[00:58:36.340 --> 00:58:37.500]   I love that Thanos Reddit.
[00:58:37.500 --> 00:58:38.500]   That was awesome.
[00:58:38.500 --> 00:58:39.500]   Isn't that funny?
[00:58:39.500 --> 00:58:40.500]   Yeah.
[00:58:40.500 --> 00:58:41.500]   That's a really good thing.
[00:58:41.500 --> 00:58:42.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:58:42.500 --> 00:58:43.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:58:43.500 --> 00:58:44.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:58:44.500 --> 00:58:45.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:58:45.500 --> 00:58:46.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:58:46.500 --> 00:58:47.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:58:47.500 --> 00:58:48.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:58:48.500 --> 00:58:49.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:58:49.500 --> 00:58:50.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:58:50.500 --> 00:58:51.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:58:51.500 --> 00:58:52.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:58:52.500 --> 00:58:53.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:58:53.500 --> 00:58:54.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:58:54.500 --> 00:58:55.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:58:55.500 --> 00:58:56.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:58:56.500 --> 00:58:57.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:58:57.500 --> 00:58:58.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:58:58.500 --> 00:58:59.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:58:59.500 --> 00:59:00.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:59:00.500 --> 00:59:07.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:59:07.500 --> 00:59:10.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:59:10.500 --> 00:59:11.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:59:11.500 --> 00:59:12.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:59:12.500 --> 00:59:13.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:59:13.500 --> 00:59:14.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:59:14.500 --> 00:59:15.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:59:15.500 --> 00:59:16.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:59:16.500 --> 00:59:17.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:59:17.500 --> 00:59:18.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:59:18.500 --> 00:59:19.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:59:19.500 --> 00:59:20.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:59:20.500 --> 00:59:21.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:59:21.500 --> 00:59:22.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:59:22.500 --> 00:59:23.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:59:23.500 --> 00:59:24.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:59:24.500 --> 00:59:25.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:59:25.500 --> 00:59:26.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:59:26.500 --> 00:59:27.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:59:27.500 --> 00:59:28.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:59:28.500 --> 00:59:29.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:59:29.500 --> 00:59:30.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:59:30.500 --> 00:59:31.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:59:31.500 --> 00:59:32.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:59:32.500 --> 00:59:33.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:59:33.500 --> 00:59:34.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:59:34.500 --> 00:59:35.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:59:35.500 --> 00:59:36.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:59:36.500 --> 00:59:37.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:59:37.500 --> 00:59:38.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:59:38.500 --> 00:59:39.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:59:39.500 --> 00:59:40.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:59:40.500 --> 00:59:41.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:59:41.500 --> 00:59:42.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:59:42.500 --> 00:59:43.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:59:43.500 --> 00:59:44.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:59:44.500 --> 00:59:45.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:59:45.500 --> 00:59:46.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:59:46.500 --> 00:59:47.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:59:47.500 --> 00:59:48.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:59:48.500 --> 00:59:49.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:59:49.500 --> 00:59:50.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:59:50.500 --> 00:59:51.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:59:51.500 --> 00:59:52.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:59:52.500 --> 00:59:53.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:59:53.500 --> 00:59:54.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:59:54.500 --> 00:59:55.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:59:55.500 --> 00:59:56.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:59:56.500 --> 00:59:57.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:59:57.500 --> 00:59:58.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:59:58.500 --> 00:59:59.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[00:59:59.500 --> 01:00:00.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:01.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:02.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:03.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:04.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:05.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:06.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:07.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:08.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:00:08.500 --> 01:00:09.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:10.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:11.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:12.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:13.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:14.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:15.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:16.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:00:16.500 --> 01:00:17.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:18.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:19.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:20.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:21.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:22.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:23.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:24.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:25.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:26.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:27.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:00:27.500 --> 01:00:28.500]   I think it's a really good thing.
[01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:32.500]   You know, the Intel CPU gadget is still there.
[01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:33.500]   It's running great.
[01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:34.500]   There we go.
[01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:36.500]   Now, should I...
[01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:37.500]   Okay.
[01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:39.500]   eGPU is engaged, I believe.
[01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:40.500]   Yes, it is.
[01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:41.500]   Shall I play some music?
[01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:42.500]   Let's do it.
[01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:43.500]   All right.
[01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:44.500]   Oh.
[01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:45.500]   Yep.
[01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:46.500]   I can't control the sound.
[01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:47.500]   That's a good sign.
[01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:48.500]   Actually, what I want to do is
[01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:49.500]   write a little bit.
[01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:50.500]   I'm going to write a little bit.
[01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:51.500]   I'm going to write a little bit.
[01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:52.500]   I'm going to write a little bit.
[01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:53.500]   I'm going to write a little bit.
[01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:54.500]   I'm going to write a little bit.
[01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:55.500]   I'm going to write a little bit.
[01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:56.500]   I'm going to write a little bit.
[01:00:56.500 --> 01:00:57.500]   I'm going to write a little bit.
[01:00:57.500 --> 01:01:03.500]   What I want to do is reduce the size of this, though, so that I can see the eGPU going.
[01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:04.500]   I don't hear anything.
[01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:05.500]   Do you hear anything?
[01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:06.500]   Oh my God.
[01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:12.500]   Turn it down, you kids.
[01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:13.500]   So, yeah, look at the throttle.
[01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:15.500]   Oh, no, that's the voltage.
[01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:16.500]   Never mind.
[01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:19.500]   4 GHz, 3.69 GHz.
[01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:20.500]   Temperature is actually cool.
[01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:23.500]   A cool 75 degrees Celsius.
[01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:24.500]   Why it's balmy.
[01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:26.500]   It's like the surface of Mars.
[01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:31.500]   So, I don't know how many tracks there are.
[01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:32.500]   There seems like quite a few here.
[01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:37.500]   This is the Beck demo that comes with logic.
[01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:39.500]   Seems to be handling it quite well.
[01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:43.500]   What should I do to challenge it?
[01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:44.500]   I think it's the effects, right?
[01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:45.500]   It's like the alchemy stuff.
[01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:48.500]   I think that adds some effects.
[01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:54.500]   All right, that's beyond my scope.
[01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:56.500]   Seems to be working.
[01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:58.500]   Not throttling.
[01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:00.500]   Of course, I have the eGPU on.
[01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:01.500]   I don't know.
[01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:05.500]   Should I run a movie while we're doing this?
[01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:08.500]   Let me run Handbrake.
[01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:11.500]   I can bring it to its knees, watch.
[01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:22.500]   Actually, this would be a good test of whether Handbrake, whether the patch fixes.
[01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:24.500]   So now I'm going to start transcoding.
[01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:29.500]   Let's see, I need to get an encode pending.
[01:02:29.500 --> 01:02:32.500]   So, what do we want to encode it as?
[01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:33.500]   Fast, let's not do fast.
[01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:37.500]   Let's encode it for super high quality.
[01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:41.500]   Why not in surround sound, the magic Christian ladies and gentlemen?
[01:02:41.500 --> 01:02:42.500]   Now, how much would you pay?
[01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:46.500]   Look at that temperature at 100 degrees, instantly.
[01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:48.500]   And the processor...
[01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:53.500]   Mmm...
[01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:55.500]   It's now a nominal.
[01:02:55.500 --> 01:02:57.500]   Oh, it stopped at 3 GHz.
[01:02:57.500 --> 01:02:59.500]   Now it's coming back.
[01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:05.500]   I'm doing logic and transcoding the magic Christian in extreme quality.
[01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:07.500]   Maybe the patch did make a difference.
[01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:09.500]   Look at that.
[01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:10.500]   That's awesome.
[01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:11.500]   Look at that.
[01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:17.500]   On Saturday, we were able to bring the processor to its knees,
[01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:18.500]   even just transcoding.
[01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:20.500]   Now I presume it's using the GPU, right?
[01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:22.500]   It's only a way to know that.
[01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:25.500]   I mean, you can unplug it and run it and see what it looks like.
[01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:26.500]   Unplug it.
[01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:28.500]   No way, you saw what happened last time.
[01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:32.500]   Not again, never again.
[01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:34.500]   Eject it, sorry, I meant to eject it.
[01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:38.500]   Yeah, it's now a nominal 2.9 GHz.
[01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:40.500]   It's right on the line there.
[01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:44.500]   It's not going below it, which is interesting.
[01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:47.500]   And it's not too hot to touch.
[01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:48.500]   It's hot.
[01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:50.500]   Okay, so there you go.
[01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:54.500]   You hear it playing the logic without faltering.
[01:03:54.500 --> 01:03:57.500]   You hear it trans... you see it transcoding.
[01:03:57.500 --> 01:04:00.500]   That's good enough for me.
[01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:01.500]   Right?
[01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:02.500]   Yep.
[01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:04.500]   No, Andy?
[01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:11.500]   No, no, I was grunting in affirmation and also acknowledging that when you get to performance of this kind,
[01:04:11.500 --> 01:04:15.500]   it doesn't raise all boats in the harbor at the same time.
[01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:16.500]   Right.
[01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:18.500]   It really depends on what you're doing.
[01:04:18.500 --> 01:04:29.500]   And mostly the explanation for these highest end pro machines is if you can figure out how much money you lost by having to wait 10 minutes for something to happen,
[01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:33.500]   it's usually worth your investigating the newest hottest hardware.
[01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:40.500]   Right.
[01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:45.500]   The performance delta between the entry level MacBook and the highest level MacBook has never been bigger than it has in the past two or three years.
[01:04:45.500 --> 01:04:51.500]   So I would always buy the best MacBook I could afford because it was still kind of affordable.
[01:04:51.500 --> 01:05:02.500]   But now, if you're expecting to spend a multiple of performance correlation with the multiple of money you're spending on a MacBook,
[01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:06.500]   you might want to back off and do some more thinking.
[01:05:06.500 --> 01:05:07.500]   Right.
[01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:13.500]   Somebody reminded me that the iStap menu will show the GPU.
[01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:16.500]   Let me restart all of this.
[01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:18.500]   Overwrite that.
[01:05:18.500 --> 01:05:22.500]   Start playing the music.
[01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:27.500]   And then let's look at iStap menu.
[01:05:27.500 --> 01:05:31.500]   Let's move this over.
[01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:36.500]   What is the eGPU going here?
[01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:41.500]   560 and 580 both seem to be in use.
[01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:43.500]   The 580 is the external GPU.
[01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:46.500]   Look at that peg right over there.
[01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:51.500]   Does it use both of the eGPU that uses the internal and the external or is it just kind of that's just?
[01:05:51.500 --> 01:05:53.500]   It makes like a pool, right?
[01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:54.500]   Interesting.
[01:05:54.500 --> 01:05:55.500]   Interesting.
[01:05:55.500 --> 01:05:59.500]   So I am pegging the CPU as you can see.
[01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:08.500]   So all four or all six processors are maxed as one would expect.
[01:06:08.500 --> 01:06:16.500]   And the eGPU is not maxed but it's engaged.
[01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:17.500]   What do you think?
[01:06:17.500 --> 01:06:19.500]   And the music's playing?
[01:06:19.500 --> 01:06:21.500]   It all seems about right.
[01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:24.500]   This is interesting because it's done something.
[01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:31.500]   This must be the patch.
[01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:34.500]   Look how flat that is.
[01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:37.500]   But doesn't that mean thermals would be a problem or what?
[01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:39.500]   Maybe this is the voltage solution.
[01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:41.500]   How hot is it getting for you?
[01:06:41.500 --> 01:06:43.500]   Yeah, still staying underneath.
[01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:45.500]   Yeah, it's 97.
[01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:47.500]   Again, it's flat as well.
[01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:50.500]   I don't think the fans are all the way up.
[01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:51.500]   I'm sure.
[01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:53.500]   It's warm.
[01:06:53.500 --> 01:06:55.500]   It's not unbearable.
[01:06:55.500 --> 01:06:57.500]   You feel the bottom.
[01:06:57.500 --> 01:07:01.500]   Yeah, you wouldn't want this in your lap unless it's a cold day.
[01:07:01.500 --> 01:07:02.500]   Unless you're Canadian.
[01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:03.500]   Unless you're Canadian.
[01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:05.500]   That's going to be a major cat, a tractor.
[01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:07.500]   Maybe that's what was causing the keyboards to fail.
[01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:08.500]   They're overheating.
[01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:10.500]   You're tracking cats, cats sit on them.
[01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:12.500]   The first screw's up the keyboard.
[01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:13.500]   I guess too hot for the cat.
[01:07:13.500 --> 01:07:14.500]   The cat gets off and cools down.
[01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:15.500]   The cat comes back.
[01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:22.500]   All right, we want to thank Beck for allowing us to use your music to test the eGPU.
[01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:27.500]   Now, I can do all this without the eGPU, but you saw what happened last time, so I'm not going to.
[01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:28.500]   Yes.
[01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:32.500]   There's only so far, I'll go with all of this.
[01:07:32.500 --> 01:07:38.500]   I really wish, by the way, that Apple would use a little bit of its cash to pay artists to do that more often, you know, to release their songs.
[01:07:38.500 --> 01:07:39.500]   Yeah.
[01:07:39.500 --> 01:07:40.500]   Multitrack.
[01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:43.500]   I mean, I think that that could be part of a release process.
[01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:46.500]   You know, we're going to release the Drake album and one of the songs.
[01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:51.500]   It doesn't have to be with the single that they're planning, but one of the songs on the album is actually going to be completely broken.
[01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:56.500]   And the garage band will load right into logic.
[01:07:56.500 --> 01:07:58.500]   Such a great way to learn.
[01:07:58.500 --> 01:07:59.500]   Absolutely.
[01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:00.500]   Absolutely.
[01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:03.500]   And I think that there's a huge opportunity to make...
[01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:11.500]   Now, artists get very sensitive to it, but take it, create an extra track that most of the people have recorded more songs than what end up on the album.
[01:08:11.500 --> 01:08:20.500]   So, taking one that is reasonably good and putting it out there, and it still sounds professional, still sounds like something you can hear on the radio.
[01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:22.500]   And you're not as attached to it.
[01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:26.500]   Like, if someone started remixing it or adding it, you'd be heartbroken.
[01:08:26.500 --> 01:08:32.500]   But giving people that creative, being able to play with it and doing it often is something that Apple could do today.
[01:08:32.500 --> 01:08:35.500]   And it would... in the grand scheme of things.
[01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:39.500]   I mean, they'd pay their artist an extra 50 grand or an extra 100 grand for...
[01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:47.500]   You know, they could... an artist could end up paying for a lot of their recording of the entire thing, because then it gets more people playing with garage band.
[01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:51.500]   And really seeing how far garage band can be pushed.
[01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:53.500]   You know, I think that's part of it.
[01:08:53.500 --> 01:08:55.500]   And logic.
[01:08:55.500 --> 01:08:59.500]   So, I understand now what happens with the... you disconnect the EGPU.
[01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:01.500]   It effectively reboots the machine.
[01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:06.500]   It doesn't quite reboot, but it shuts every process down.
[01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:12.500]   In case it's... Now, I use said EGPU to say every process should use the EGPU.
[01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:15.500]   Maybe that was a... maybe that was a mistake.
[01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:17.500]   [laughter]
[01:09:17.500 --> 01:09:22.500]   You see how getting nervous about all this stuff can just really make your life worse, right?
[01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:23.500]   [laughter]
[01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:25.500]   Just don't worry about it.
[01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:26.500]   Spend money and joy.
[01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:28.500]   All right, I do not have an EGPU now.
[01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:34.500]   I am going to... I know you won't be able to see this, but you'll be able to hear it.
[01:09:34.500 --> 01:09:36.500]   [laughter]
[01:09:36.500 --> 01:09:40.500]   I'm gonna... one more time. I'm sorry. I hate to belabor this, but I want to become a YouTube star.
[01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:41.500]   Nope.
[01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:43.500]   It's like starting up "Air Wolf."
[01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:45.500]   It's just a great sound.
[01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:46.500]   Yeah.
[01:09:46.500 --> 01:09:47.500]   Yeah.
[01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:48.500]   You'll launch Handbrake.
[01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:51.500]   We're gonna transcode for the 50th time.
[01:09:51.500 --> 01:09:52.500]   I'm saying, "Hey, dudes."
[01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:53.500]   Hey, guys.
[01:09:53.500 --> 01:09:54.500]   Hey, guys.
[01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:55.500]   What's happening?
[01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:57.500]   All right, we're now transcoding.
[01:09:57.500 --> 01:09:59.500]   We are now logicing.
[01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:01.500]   We are now playing music.
[01:10:01.500 --> 01:10:04.500]   Now, let's watch this processor and see what happens.
[01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:07.500]   Do you hear my music?
[01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:09.500]   Oh, you can't hear it.
[01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:10.500]   That's right.
[01:10:10.500 --> 01:10:11.500]   No, don't worry.
[01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:12.500]   We don't care about that.
[01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:13.500]   It's not that important.
[01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:14.500]   It's playing.
[01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:15.500]   That's the main thing.
[01:10:15.500 --> 01:10:18.500]   And the same thing is happening, right?
[01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:21.500]   Which is this flat line in the processor at 2.9 gigahertz.
[01:10:21.500 --> 01:10:25.500]   It's kind of normal nominal speed.
[01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:27.500]   It's transcoding slowing down.
[01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:28.500]   I don't know.
[01:10:28.500 --> 01:10:31.500]   [music]
[01:10:31.500 --> 01:10:33.500]   Temperature again flat.
[01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:38.500]   So this looks exactly the same as it did with the EGPU, and it seems like everything is continuing as...
[01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:39.500]   As it does it can.
[01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:40.500]   So that's good news.
[01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:43.500]   I feel like that patch definitely did something.
[01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:48.500]   I didn't have the benefit of trying this before the patch, but...
[01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:50.500]   This is behavior we never saw.
[01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:52.500]   One patched machines, one patched machine, Leo.
[01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:53.500]   We'll put them in the races.
[01:10:53.500 --> 01:10:54.500]   Yeah.
[01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:58.500]   The thing, and I just want to point out, and I'll do this because people are probably saying,
[01:10:58.500 --> 01:10:59.500]   "Well, wait a minute.
[01:10:59.500 --> 01:11:05.500]   It goes below speed here, but that's supposed...
[01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:09.500]   When you're not doing anything, it should.
[01:11:09.500 --> 01:11:10.500]   That's what gets you better battery life."
[01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:15.500]   And notice how quickly it responds to the nothing to do.
[01:11:15.500 --> 01:11:17.500]   The temperature goes down very quickly.
[01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:19.500]   The voltage goes down very quickly.
[01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:21.500]   The utilization is now 2%.
[01:11:21.500 --> 01:11:24.500]   And as a result, it's GPU is it.
[01:11:24.500 --> 01:11:26.500]   The CPU is at 1.37 gigahertz.
[01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:28.500]   But that's because I don't need it.
[01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:29.500]   It's not doing it.
[01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:31.500]   A lot of people think that slower is more efficient, but it's not.
[01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:33.500]   Whether you do in chips is race to sleep.
[01:11:33.500 --> 01:11:35.500]   So you get things on as fast as possible and shut off.
[01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:37.500]   So you're not using any power.
[01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:40.500]   And that's the best performance you can usually get.
[01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:45.660]   I don't think that it's generally understood exactly how much of computer science and computer
[01:11:45.660 --> 01:11:50.500]   engineering is invested in trying to get the GPU to stop doing anything.
[01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:53.500]   That is the central thing to...
[01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:59.260]   Because if it's a low power device, like a phone or a tablet, you're desperately trying
[01:11:59.260 --> 01:12:00.340]   to save battery.
[01:12:00.340 --> 01:12:04.780]   If it's a high power device, you're desperately trying to save the life of the CPU by making
[01:12:04.780 --> 01:12:06.780]   sure it doesn't fire up harder than it has to.
[01:12:06.780 --> 01:12:10.460]   I feel like this is all...
[01:12:10.460 --> 01:12:14.300]   Power management is aggressive on this and is doing exactly what you would expect it
[01:12:14.300 --> 01:12:16.780]   and want it to do, right?
[01:12:16.780 --> 01:12:19.780]   Yeah, that's exactly.
[01:12:19.780 --> 01:12:22.820]   You want it to go as fast as possible with the remote constraints of the device.
[01:12:22.820 --> 01:12:24.780]   You want to manage that all the time.
[01:12:24.780 --> 01:12:25.780]   And now we're getting...
[01:12:25.780 --> 01:12:29.580]   At least it's not going below 2.9 gigahertz, which is the reason you bought the i9 because
[01:12:29.580 --> 01:12:33.380]   that 200 megahertz faster than the i7.
[01:12:33.380 --> 01:12:37.580]   It's time to work.
[01:12:37.580 --> 01:12:40.100]   Really it's an implementation detail and for most people it's time to work.
[01:12:40.100 --> 01:12:43.620]   If it finishes faster, it's better and you don't really need to micro manage the frequencies
[01:12:43.620 --> 01:12:44.620]   in between.
[01:12:44.620 --> 01:12:45.620]   That's right.
[01:12:45.620 --> 01:12:46.620]   That's exactly right.
[01:12:46.620 --> 01:12:47.620]   All right.
[01:12:47.620 --> 01:12:50.940]   Sorry, we had to belabor that.
[01:12:50.940 --> 01:12:51.940]   It's Mac news.
[01:12:51.940 --> 01:12:52.940]   Come on.
[01:12:52.940 --> 01:12:53.940]   We have it.
[01:12:53.940 --> 01:12:54.940]   We have it.
[01:12:54.940 --> 01:12:55.940]   We're actually going to do it, right?
[01:12:55.940 --> 01:12:59.460]   This was something that requires a deep dive because especially because when people hear,
[01:12:59.460 --> 01:13:05.380]   the new Apple something is defective and it's a swindle of some sort, it's not enough
[01:13:05.380 --> 01:13:07.620]   simply to say, "Well, there's a patch that got fixed.
[01:13:07.620 --> 01:13:12.700]   We all have to understand what the problem was, how that got fixed, did it get fixed?"
[01:13:12.700 --> 01:13:20.100]   And everyone should understand that this is morning information for lots of people today.
[01:13:20.100 --> 01:13:27.180]   Well, I really hurt my feelings a little bit to see all of these pile on posts that I felt
[01:13:27.180 --> 01:13:29.860]   like we're not accurate.
[01:13:29.860 --> 01:13:33.420]   I don't think I need to tell you guys I'm not an Apple fanboy by any means, although now
[01:13:33.420 --> 01:13:38.300]   with Serenity at Apple, maybe I get an invite to this.
[01:13:38.300 --> 01:13:41.660]   Well, Lisa, what, sorry, film girl is at Microsoft.
[01:13:41.660 --> 01:13:43.140]   So Christina Warren is at Microsoft.
[01:13:43.140 --> 01:13:44.140]   You have to love everybody.
[01:13:44.140 --> 01:13:45.140]   We're losing them all.
[01:13:45.140 --> 01:13:47.020]   No, I do love everybody.
[01:13:47.020 --> 01:13:50.540]   And I love and hate everybody equally.
[01:13:50.540 --> 01:13:52.340]   And I want to be fair is my main...
[01:13:52.340 --> 01:13:53.340]   And Yasmin is a...
[01:13:53.340 --> 01:13:54.340]   I mean, like there's just...
[01:13:54.340 --> 01:13:56.060]   They all the companies to love people we love.
[01:13:56.060 --> 01:14:01.740]   I will no longer talk to film girl or Serenity because I don't want to have friends at any
[01:14:01.740 --> 01:14:04.340]   of these companies because I don't want to be...
[01:14:04.340 --> 01:14:05.340]   I'm being facetious.
[01:14:05.340 --> 01:14:08.140]   But really, I don't want to be swayed by friendship.
[01:14:08.140 --> 01:14:09.500]   I want to be fair.
[01:14:09.500 --> 01:14:11.900]   And I felt like that was unfair.
[01:14:11.900 --> 01:14:14.340]   And I'm certainly going to be the first to say if Apple does something wrong.
[01:14:14.340 --> 01:14:16.780]   It was so much noise and so little data.
[01:14:16.780 --> 01:14:18.620]   And what you need to follow these things is data.
[01:14:18.620 --> 01:14:22.300]   So rather than come up with these cockamamie theories, just do more tests.
[01:14:22.300 --> 01:14:23.300]   Right.
[01:14:23.300 --> 01:14:25.300]   And I kind of wanted to wait till an on-tech head of test.
[01:14:25.300 --> 01:14:28.340]   The hard part is you don't get views by doing more tests.
[01:14:28.340 --> 01:14:29.340]   That's right.
[01:14:29.340 --> 01:14:31.340]   You get views by saying it's all broken.
[01:14:31.340 --> 01:14:32.340]   It's all stuck.
[01:14:32.340 --> 01:14:33.820]   But you stuff in the freezer.
[01:14:33.820 --> 01:14:36.700]   Which by the way, don't do that.
[01:14:36.700 --> 01:14:39.060]   And in all fairness, I mean blogs do the same thing.
[01:14:39.060 --> 01:14:41.700]   Reporters look to blogs the same way blogs look at YouTube.
[01:14:41.700 --> 01:14:42.700]   And the cycle keeps going.
[01:14:42.700 --> 01:14:46.060]   It's just there are certain people in every industry, no industry is monolithic.
[01:14:46.060 --> 01:14:47.300]   Some people do amazing work.
[01:14:47.300 --> 01:14:48.300]   Some people do the opposite.
[01:14:48.300 --> 01:14:49.300]   I'm a podcaster.
[01:14:49.300 --> 01:14:50.300]   I hate everybody.
[01:14:50.300 --> 01:14:51.300]   Yeah.
[01:14:51.300 --> 01:14:53.700]   So that's why I'm going to have some wine right now from Wink.
[01:14:53.700 --> 01:14:54.700]   Oh!
[01:14:54.700 --> 01:14:57.020]   I'm sorry you guys aren't here.
[01:14:57.020 --> 01:14:58.380]   It's the time of day.
[01:14:58.380 --> 01:14:59.980]   It's that five o'clock somewhere.
[01:14:59.980 --> 01:15:03.820]   Wink is a wine club that makes its own wine.
[01:15:03.820 --> 01:15:05.940]   That's a very big difference.
[01:15:05.940 --> 01:15:10.660]   There and they select wines to match your taste.
[01:15:10.660 --> 01:15:13.340]   So what you got to do is you got to go to the website.
[01:15:13.340 --> 01:15:16.340]   T-R-Y-W-I-N-C.
[01:15:16.340 --> 01:15:17.580]   Get it wine club.
[01:15:17.580 --> 01:15:19.780]   W-I-N-C dot com slash Mac break.
[01:15:19.780 --> 01:15:22.500]   Try Wink dot com slash Mac break.
[01:15:22.500 --> 01:15:26.540]   You go through the palette quiz, which is a lot of fun.
[01:15:26.540 --> 01:15:28.580]   It'll profile your tastes.
[01:15:28.580 --> 01:15:29.580]   Do you like salt?
[01:15:29.580 --> 01:15:30.580]   Do you like cotty?
[01:15:30.580 --> 01:15:31.580]   Take your coffee?
[01:15:31.580 --> 01:15:32.580]   Do you like citrus?
[01:15:32.580 --> 01:15:33.580]   Do you like peppers?
[01:15:33.580 --> 01:15:34.580]   Mushrooms?
[01:15:34.580 --> 01:15:37.220]   You get a sense of what you like.
[01:15:37.220 --> 01:15:41.820]   And then they'll send you wines for wines a month, which is perfect, right?
[01:15:41.820 --> 01:15:42.820]   Two for me.
[01:15:42.820 --> 01:15:44.340]   I would say four bottles a month.
[01:15:44.340 --> 01:15:50.340]   I would say four is just right because one in the cellar, one to bring to friends, and
[01:15:50.340 --> 01:15:55.540]   then a couple for you, for your me for a fine meal or date night.
[01:15:55.540 --> 01:15:58.660]   Here's a Malbec from Mendoza, Argentina.
[01:15:58.660 --> 01:15:59.860]   They also have artists designed.
[01:15:59.860 --> 01:16:00.860]   Yeah, it's good.
[01:16:00.860 --> 01:16:01.860]   It's really.
[01:16:01.860 --> 01:16:02.860]   You like Malbecs?
[01:16:02.860 --> 01:16:04.100]   Should we open this up?
[01:16:04.100 --> 01:16:07.260]   No, they're nodding out there.
[01:16:07.260 --> 01:16:08.940]   Our audience wants me to open the wine.
[01:16:08.940 --> 01:16:11.780]   I think it's a little bit early to open the wine.
[01:16:11.780 --> 01:16:13.780]   It's hour three of the Today Show.
[01:16:13.780 --> 01:16:14.780]   Oh, yeah.
[01:16:14.780 --> 01:16:18.180]   It is tempo vero.
[01:16:18.180 --> 01:16:19.580]   This is an Italian, I think.
[01:16:19.580 --> 01:16:24.660]   Yeah, product of Italy, Negromaro, Saliento.
[01:16:24.660 --> 01:16:25.900]   So this with what?
[01:16:25.900 --> 01:16:27.700]   Oh, I love the, I love it.
[01:16:27.700 --> 01:16:32.940]   With wild peaches, ancient forests and tempting local cuisine, the increasingly important wine
[01:16:32.940 --> 01:16:37.220]   region of Saliento, anybody I've never heard of that, is nestled in the heel of Italy's
[01:16:37.220 --> 01:16:40.540]   boot just waiting to be discovered.
[01:16:40.540 --> 01:16:43.300]   So you get notes of Blackberry, sour cherry, currant, and spice.
[01:16:43.300 --> 01:16:44.740]   So it's a full-bodied big wine.
[01:16:44.740 --> 01:16:47.860]   You'd expect that from southern Italy because of the sun.
[01:16:47.860 --> 01:16:49.300]   That sounds wonderful.
[01:16:49.300 --> 01:16:55.860]   So these are all made by Winx-Vintners, brought to you very affordably.
[01:16:55.860 --> 01:17:01.420]   If you ever get something you don't enjoy, no problem, they'll send you another bottle,
[01:17:01.420 --> 01:17:03.340]   no questions asked.
[01:17:03.340 --> 01:17:09.260]   Every month new delicious wines like the insanely popular Summerwater Rose, which is amazing.
[01:17:09.260 --> 01:17:13.260]   Here's what I'm going to have, I think, because it's getting hot, the Shenan Blanc from South
[01:17:13.260 --> 01:17:14.820]   Africa.
[01:17:14.820 --> 01:17:15.820]   Cape route.
[01:17:15.820 --> 01:17:16.820]   Look at the labels.
[01:17:16.820 --> 01:17:21.220]   You'd be happy to bring these to your friends when you're invited to a dinner party because
[01:17:21.220 --> 01:17:23.300]   they'll go, "Oh, that's..."
[01:17:23.300 --> 01:17:25.580]   And this is stuff maybe you've never heard of.
[01:17:25.580 --> 01:17:28.460]   I have an of Saliento, the Saliento wine region.
[01:17:28.460 --> 01:17:29.460]   Here's Diviner.
[01:17:29.460 --> 01:17:37.540]   This is a Sauvignon Blanc from Santa Enes Valley in California.
[01:17:37.540 --> 01:17:41.700]   So you can mix and match whites and reds depending on your favorites.
[01:17:41.700 --> 01:17:43.340]   You can pick ones you like, of course.
[01:17:43.340 --> 01:17:49.260]   If you have one, the field theory is my absolute favorite, so I always make sure my case always
[01:17:49.260 --> 01:17:52.020]   comes with one field theory at least in there.
[01:17:52.020 --> 01:17:55.500]   They partner with local artists as it develop the wine labels that are unique.
[01:17:55.500 --> 01:17:56.700]   There's no membership fees.
[01:17:56.700 --> 01:17:58.260]   You can skip any month.
[01:17:58.260 --> 01:18:00.180]   You can cancel any time.
[01:18:00.180 --> 01:18:01.820]   So there's really no obligation.
[01:18:01.820 --> 01:18:03.860]   Shipping's covered.
[01:18:03.860 --> 01:18:06.700]   And as I said, if you don't like a bottle, they'll replace it with one you love, no questions
[01:18:06.700 --> 01:18:07.700]   asked.
[01:18:07.700 --> 01:18:09.580]   Wink, I love Wink.
[01:18:09.580 --> 01:18:10.940]   Why drink the same old wine?
[01:18:10.940 --> 01:18:12.740]   We all get wine ruts.
[01:18:12.740 --> 01:18:14.980]   So I know what that's going to be.
[01:18:14.980 --> 01:18:20.820]   Explore new regions, new tastes, and find stuff you absolutely love.
[01:18:20.820 --> 01:18:22.940]   T-R-Y-W-I-N-C.

[01:18:29.860 --> 01:18:30.980]   They're demanding the Malbec.
[01:18:30.980 --> 01:18:31.980]   I love Malbecs too.
[01:18:31.980 --> 01:18:36.380]   You're going to have to fight my wife for this because she loves Malbecs too.
[01:18:36.380 --> 01:18:41.180]   Try Wink.com/MacBreak for $20 off your first shipment.
[01:18:41.180 --> 01:18:46.980]   The Play Store beat the App Store for downloads in Q2 2018.
[01:18:46.980 --> 01:18:47.980]   Cause for concern?
[01:18:47.980 --> 01:18:51.060]   I'm not only looking at the profit numbers.
[01:18:51.060 --> 01:18:52.060]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:18:52.060 --> 01:18:53.060]   Yeah.
[01:18:53.060 --> 01:18:55.340]   But it's a little bit obscure about it.
[01:18:55.340 --> 01:18:57.260]   Less than half the spending according to App.
[01:18:57.260 --> 01:19:01.980]   It should be so much bigger than the App Store just based on number of devices and market.
[01:19:01.980 --> 01:19:02.980]   Right.
[01:19:02.980 --> 01:19:03.980]   It's exactly what it's doing.
[01:19:03.980 --> 01:19:08.820]   Well, not all Android devices have access to the App Store, which is something that
[01:19:08.820 --> 01:19:11.620]   the EU was now finding Google for.
[01:19:11.620 --> 01:19:12.620]   Yep.
[01:19:12.620 --> 01:19:16.900]   There was a great survey by Ben Beherrin who was looking at money spent in the App Store
[01:19:16.900 --> 01:19:18.300]   and how people do what.
[01:19:18.300 --> 01:19:21.660]   And it just, it should come as no surprise, but people who are willing to buy iPhones
[01:19:21.660 --> 01:19:23.460]   are more willing to pay for apps.
[01:19:23.460 --> 01:19:29.100]   Well, again, I really don't like comparisons between the Play Store is more successful
[01:19:29.100 --> 01:19:35.300]   than the App Store or the iPhone is not the dominant operating system here.
[01:19:35.300 --> 01:19:40.380]   They're just two such complete different things because with Android, you're not just talking
[01:19:40.380 --> 01:19:46.660]   about, you're not just talking about like 2018, studly phones, things that are actually
[01:19:46.660 --> 01:19:48.300]   competitive with the iPhone.
[01:19:48.300 --> 01:19:53.220]   You're also talking about like, but the bike computer that I own that runs and runs the
[01:19:53.220 --> 01:19:56.500]   free version of Android, but obviously it has no access to the App Store.
[01:19:56.500 --> 01:19:58.900]   You're also talking about Amazon devices.
[01:19:58.900 --> 01:20:01.860]   You're also talking about old phones to get blister pack.
[01:20:01.860 --> 01:20:07.080]   You're talking about phones in China, for instance, that are running again the open
[01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:12.420]   source version of Android, but don't get access to, because they don't sign those agreements
[01:20:12.420 --> 01:20:13.660]   with Google.
[01:20:13.660 --> 01:20:15.900]   They don't have access to the Play Store or other things.
[01:20:15.900 --> 01:20:20.340]   So whether you see a stat that makes Android look like it's doing better or Apple looks
[01:20:20.340 --> 01:20:24.460]   like it's doing better, you really have to attack the fine print before you come to any
[01:20:24.460 --> 01:20:26.060]   conclusion whatsoever.
[01:20:26.060 --> 01:20:28.740]   The one that really startled me though is that when people switched from Android to
[01:20:28.740 --> 01:20:30.900]   iPhone, they started spending more on apps.
[01:20:30.900 --> 01:20:34.620]   Which I thought was interesting too, because it's not based on, it means it's not person-based.
[01:20:34.620 --> 01:20:39.740]   There is an economy where hegemoni play there.
[01:20:39.740 --> 01:20:40.740]   That's interesting.
[01:20:40.740 --> 01:20:44.020]   But maybe that there are more free apps on Android.
[01:20:44.020 --> 01:20:45.020]   Pardon me?
[01:20:45.020 --> 01:20:48.020]   There may be more free apps on Android, so when you get to the iPhone.
[01:20:48.020 --> 01:20:52.060]   Totally, it's just, and his survey, and Carolina Milanes, who's brilliant, did a really good
[01:20:52.060 --> 01:20:55.740]   deep dive into all the different things, because people are really worried, because
[01:20:55.740 --> 01:20:56.940]   we see it with every industry.
[01:20:56.940 --> 01:20:58.580]   People don't want to pay for news anymore.
[01:20:58.580 --> 01:20:59.580]   They don't want to pay for TV.
[01:20:59.580 --> 01:21:01.020]   They don't want to pay for apps.
[01:21:01.020 --> 01:21:06.100]   And app vendors, they kept the prices for a lot longer than music industry people did.
[01:21:06.100 --> 01:21:10.300]   And now there's like Spotify and Apple Music, and it's much less than you used to get paid.
[01:21:10.300 --> 01:21:12.940]   And that's happening to apps, and people are going to subscriptions, and they're nervous
[01:21:12.940 --> 01:21:15.660]   about it, and they don't know, will they pay a subscription?
[01:21:15.660 --> 01:21:17.620]   Will they pay for 10 app subscriptions a month?
[01:21:17.620 --> 01:21:18.620]   A hundred?
[01:21:18.620 --> 01:21:19.620]   Will it scale?
[01:21:19.620 --> 01:21:21.740]   Are they going to demand bundles?
[01:21:21.740 --> 01:21:26.260]   It's a very stressful, I think, economy for a lot of app developers.
[01:21:26.260 --> 01:21:30.260]   And I think stuff like this is only beginning to be investigated.
[01:21:30.260 --> 01:21:37.460]   Well I think that just like with Spotify and Apple Music, as that net gets bigger, there's
[01:21:37.460 --> 01:21:39.740]   an opportunity to make a lot more money too.
[01:21:39.740 --> 01:21:44.500]   I think that it wasn't, yes, people weren't making as much, music industry is not making
[01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:48.820]   as much money with Spotify and Apple Music when they started.
[01:21:48.820 --> 01:21:54.100]   But as we start to get a larger and larger percentage of the music listening audience
[01:21:54.100 --> 01:21:58.380]   into those pools, the music industry is starting to make a lot more money.
[01:21:58.380 --> 01:22:06.700]   And there's an avenue for artists to bypass the middlemen completely and go straight to
[01:22:06.700 --> 01:22:07.980]   the platform.
[01:22:07.980 --> 01:22:11.900]   And so there's a lot of opportunity that those platforms, which I think a lot of us
[01:22:11.900 --> 01:22:15.140]   who are watching this, knew that that would happen eventually.
[01:22:15.140 --> 01:22:20.580]   It's not what, you know, a lot of artists were very upset.
[01:22:20.580 --> 01:22:25.820]   And a lot of the time it wasn't because they weren't getting a large percentage from, they
[01:22:25.820 --> 01:22:29.460]   weren't seeing any of it or very little of it from the record company, you know, and
[01:22:29.460 --> 01:22:31.500]   that's why they weren't getting paid.
[01:22:31.500 --> 01:22:34.580]   But I think that these numbers are getting much larger because the pool is getting much
[01:22:34.580 --> 01:22:35.580]   larger.
[01:22:35.580 --> 01:22:38.420]   And I think that we'll continue to see people making more money, whether it's subscription
[01:22:38.420 --> 01:22:39.420]   or they're selling the app.
[01:22:39.420 --> 01:22:42.060]   I know personally I like to buy stuff.
[01:22:42.060 --> 01:22:47.740]   Like I don't like to, what I like, what I really think is a great model is the free
[01:22:47.740 --> 01:22:49.580]   download with an in-app purchase.
[01:22:49.580 --> 01:22:54.180]   I think that is just such a great model because now I get a sense of what your app does and
[01:22:54.180 --> 01:22:55.260]   then I pay for it.
[01:22:55.260 --> 01:23:00.340]   I do get concerned that I'm getting into these like lots and lots of little $2 and $3.
[01:23:00.340 --> 01:23:02.460]   And I think at the beginning I was like, oh, that's fine.
[01:23:02.460 --> 01:23:06.300]   Now I think really hard before I start subscribing because I'm just afraid I'm just going to
[01:23:06.300 --> 01:23:07.300]   forget about it.
[01:23:07.300 --> 01:23:11.260]   And you know, I'm going to start getting bigger bills and I have started to go through iTunes
[01:23:11.260 --> 01:23:14.820]   and call out, you know, the subscriptions that I have.
[01:23:14.820 --> 01:23:18.580]   At least iTunes makes it really, it's about the easiest way to find your subscription.
[01:23:18.580 --> 01:23:22.540]   Also for like music, you can subscribe to Spotify and get almost all music.
[01:23:22.540 --> 01:23:25.980]   You don't have to subscribe on a studio by studio basis or an artist by artist basis,
[01:23:25.980 --> 01:23:29.700]   which is what people are complaining about with TV now because you need Netflix and you
[01:23:29.700 --> 01:23:33.660]   need Hulu and you need the new DC network and you need the new Disney network and you
[01:23:33.660 --> 01:23:35.700]   need the new CBS network.
[01:23:35.700 --> 01:23:39.540]   And suddenly you have 800 subscriptions again and people can't manage that and will apps
[01:23:39.540 --> 01:23:43.020]   end up being the same as that or will there be something that's like a like Amazon had
[01:23:43.020 --> 01:23:48.460]   a subscription app service for a while that will Apple and Google rolled out subscription
[01:23:48.460 --> 01:23:49.460]   app services.
[01:23:49.460 --> 01:23:50.460]   Interesting.
[01:23:50.460 --> 01:23:55.180]   Well, I think the hard part for the developers and anything would be good for us as users
[01:23:55.180 --> 01:23:59.340]   is to if what if we paid, you know, a certain amount to Apple and we had a subscription and
[01:23:59.340 --> 01:24:01.340]   we were just able to be downloaded.
[01:24:01.340 --> 01:24:05.420]   And the problem is that you would be paid by usage and a lot of us that you buy the app
[01:24:05.420 --> 01:24:08.260]   and then you use it for like a week and then you never use it again.
[01:24:08.260 --> 01:24:12.900]   And then that could be a very unstable experience for the app developers.
[01:24:12.900 --> 01:24:18.020]   Also, also they had the experience of seeing what happens to artists on Spotify where subscription
[01:24:18.020 --> 01:24:24.180]   music services their revenue is negligible and the effect is most largely promotional
[01:24:24.180 --> 01:24:28.460]   so that they can hopefully steer people towards places where the band can actually make money.
[01:24:28.460 --> 01:24:34.660]   So I'm not sure the developers would be really keen on signing up for if a band that's had
[01:24:34.660 --> 01:24:38.100]   hit albums for 15 years don't like their religious with Spotify.
[01:24:38.100 --> 01:24:44.340]   I'm not sure if me and my little horsey tic-tac-toe program are going to go and get better.
[01:24:44.340 --> 01:24:49.420]   Well, as long as we're talking about Apple's versus Android, Apple's iPhones, according
[01:24:49.420 --> 01:24:54.940]   to Ucla, are slower overall than Samsung and Internet speeds.
[01:24:54.940 --> 01:24:58.020]   The average iPhone Internet speed.
[01:24:58.020 --> 01:25:03.100]   This is a Mark Gurman story from Mark Gurman and Ian King from Bloomberg.
[01:25:03.100 --> 01:25:11.820]   The average iPhone speed is, let's see, I'm trying to find it, the Samsung speeds average
[01:25:11.820 --> 01:25:14.340]   on the S9 plus 38.4 megabits.
[01:25:14.340 --> 01:25:18.340]   And this is, Ucla is of course the speed test.net.
[01:25:18.340 --> 01:25:19.500]   So they have a lot of data.
[01:25:19.500 --> 01:25:21.980]   You see my headphones now or you see my X-Pairn company?
[01:25:21.980 --> 01:25:22.980]   Yeah.
[01:25:22.980 --> 01:25:28.260]   I just know it's 69,000 phone connections, average speed, 38.4 megabits.
[01:25:28.260 --> 01:25:34.380]   Now remember, the connections vary widely, the average iPhone speed, presumably on the
[01:25:34.380 --> 01:25:39.020]   same kind of connection, 603,000 tests, 29.7 megabits.
[01:25:39.020 --> 01:25:40.020]   I don't know.
[01:25:40.020 --> 01:25:43.580]   I felt like when I saw the data, the data by itself as Andy's office pointed out was
[01:25:43.580 --> 01:25:46.620]   not very valuable because you don't know where they are.
[01:25:46.620 --> 01:25:49.340]   You don't know what route, yeah, maybe they're in the same region, but are they inside of
[01:25:49.340 --> 01:25:51.100]   a building or the outside of a building?
[01:25:51.100 --> 01:25:55.940]   And I get that there's an overall average, but I just, I was kind of curious and I opened
[01:25:55.940 --> 01:26:00.940]   up my iPhone and I hit test and got over 40 megs a second.
[01:26:00.940 --> 01:26:01.940]   Yeah.
[01:26:01.940 --> 01:26:02.940]   So I was kind of like, well, I don't know what that means.
[01:26:02.940 --> 01:26:03.940]   Literally, you know, like I don't know.
[01:26:03.940 --> 01:26:04.940]   You know, mileage may vary.
[01:26:04.940 --> 01:26:05.940]   Yeah.
[01:26:05.940 --> 01:26:08.900]   It's also, I mean, also Apple since the very beginning has been like there are things
[01:26:08.900 --> 01:26:12.100]   that Apple is very aggressive about, things they're very conservative about and radios
[01:26:12.100 --> 01:26:15.900]   have always been one of the conservative things like they didn't have 3G and the first iPhone
[01:26:15.900 --> 01:26:19.980]   and they didn't have LTE when the HTC Thunderbolt came out and they haven't been moving towards
[01:26:19.980 --> 01:26:22.060]   the same kind of modems that Android is readily embracing.
[01:26:22.060 --> 01:26:25.380]   And I don't think they'll go to 5G as fast as they may be all be wrong, but I don't think
[01:26:25.380 --> 01:26:28.940]   they'll go to 5G as fast as some of the more experimental Android phones will and Apple
[01:26:28.940 --> 01:26:29.980]   seems to be okay with that.
[01:26:29.980 --> 01:26:34.060]   They'd rather man very carefully manage the power consumption of a known and tested, you
[01:26:34.060 --> 01:26:39.740]   know, maybe second generation shrunk a processor, a radio chip and they're happy with that.
[01:26:39.740 --> 01:26:43.340]   And as long as the chip, whether it's Intel or Qualcomm can do the minimum requirements
[01:26:43.340 --> 01:26:45.500]   they have for it, they're happy using both of them.
[01:26:45.500 --> 01:26:46.660]   Well, I don't know.
[01:26:46.660 --> 01:26:52.300]   I mean, I just ran it here on my iPhone 10 download speed, 144 megabits per second upload
[01:26:52.300 --> 01:26:54.580]   speed, 167 megabits per second.
[01:26:54.580 --> 01:26:58.420]   Well, is that, but that's on your LTE or on your on your on your on your on Wi-Fi.
[01:26:58.420 --> 01:26:59.420]   Should I do LTE?
[01:26:59.420 --> 01:27:02.460]   Yeah, yeah, because that's our sonic 10 gigabit Wi-Fi.
[01:27:02.460 --> 01:27:04.700]   You see on the Mac, 800, 800 megabits.
[01:27:04.700 --> 01:27:05.700]   You want to see what megabits.
[01:27:05.700 --> 01:27:07.700]   I think they're talking about the Wi-Fi radio.
[01:27:07.700 --> 01:27:09.660]   Oh, oh, oh, oh, all right.
[01:27:09.660 --> 01:27:13.900]   Let me turn off Wi-Fi and let's let's see and I'm on T-Mobile LTE.
[01:27:13.900 --> 01:27:16.660]   So let's see what that's there.
[01:27:16.660 --> 01:27:20.900]   This is this is why this kind of a number is extremely suspicious because there are countries
[01:27:20.900 --> 01:27:25.660]   in which Samsung just absolutely kicks the iPhones, but in popularity and a lot of those
[01:27:25.660 --> 01:27:30.820]   places are places that have absolutely wonderful modern mobile broadband in the United States.
[01:27:30.820 --> 01:27:33.940]   There's so many places where where iPhone dominates.
[01:27:33.940 --> 01:27:37.820]   There's so many places where you're barely getting 3G speed.
[01:27:37.820 --> 01:27:38.980]   Yeah.
[01:27:38.980 --> 01:27:39.980]   So this is T-Mobile.
[01:27:39.980 --> 01:27:41.900]   And also it was a big day for Qualcomm yesterday.
[01:27:41.900 --> 01:27:45.260]   So those articles seem to be as my friends.
[01:27:45.260 --> 01:27:47.860]   Do you know one both on both?
[01:27:47.860 --> 01:27:50.100]   Well, I don't I don't have it on the.
[01:27:50.100 --> 01:27:52.900]   Qualcomm was super sarcastic when they asked them for comment.
[01:27:52.900 --> 01:27:55.340]   I like, well, Apple doesn't use exclusively our modems.
[01:27:55.340 --> 01:27:57.660]   And even when they do, they probably don't take best advantage of it.
[01:27:57.660 --> 01:27:58.900]   And they're involved in huge losses.
[01:27:58.900 --> 01:27:59.900]   There are.
[01:27:59.900 --> 01:28:02.220]   Yeah, we have a film to sell.
[01:28:02.220 --> 01:28:03.740]   So it's probably not fair either.
[01:28:03.740 --> 01:28:04.900]   Come on to think of it.
[01:28:04.900 --> 01:28:10.820]   For instance, if if world average broadband mobile broadband speed is 7.0 megabits per
[01:28:10.820 --> 01:28:15.020]   second, Samsung is a South Korean company.
[01:28:15.020 --> 01:28:17.380]   Average speed in South Korea is 28.6.
[01:28:17.380 --> 01:28:25.100]   So Qualcomm Gigabit LTE chips, I think, are a little faster than the Intel chips, right?
[01:28:25.100 --> 01:28:26.100]   Yeah.
[01:28:26.100 --> 01:28:27.100]   Yeah.
[01:28:27.100 --> 01:28:30.180]   But they offer the Gigabit on either.
[01:28:30.180 --> 01:28:35.020]   This is really deciding whether your car goes 120 miles an hour top speed or 140 miles
[01:28:35.020 --> 01:28:39.900]   an hour top speed, you know, compared to what most people need it for on their phone.
[01:28:39.900 --> 01:28:42.660]   You know, I think that that's a really good issue.
[01:28:42.660 --> 01:28:44.980]   I got 96 in my living room.
[01:28:44.980 --> 01:28:46.940]   So when's that 96.3?
[01:28:46.940 --> 01:28:47.940]   So it's fine.
[01:28:47.940 --> 01:28:48.940]   I'm happy.
[01:28:48.940 --> 01:28:49.940]   Yeah.
[01:28:49.940 --> 01:28:56.100]   Somebody uploaded the Apple phone repair, how to videos and now gone.
[01:28:56.100 --> 01:28:57.340]   That was like every repair.
[01:28:57.340 --> 01:28:59.100]   Yeah, that was a quick.
[01:28:59.100 --> 01:29:04.060]   That's remember how how glowingly I spoke of Downey, the Mac that was up.
[01:29:04.060 --> 01:29:06.300]   That just lets you download stuff off of YouTube.
[01:29:06.300 --> 01:29:07.300]   Yeah.
[01:29:07.300 --> 01:29:10.420]   All I had to do was navigate to that person's page, the top page, click a button and it
[01:29:10.420 --> 01:29:13.100]   downloaded everything that person had uploaded.
[01:29:13.100 --> 01:29:16.540]   Because somehow you imagine that that's not going to last very long.
[01:29:16.540 --> 01:29:17.540]   It was a go.
[01:29:17.540 --> 01:29:21.260]   And there's and there's and there's a bunch of people that walked over to somebody's desk
[01:29:21.260 --> 01:29:22.260]   at Apple.
[01:29:22.260 --> 01:29:25.260]   And that was, oh, you know what they say?
[01:29:25.260 --> 01:29:26.260]   Wow.
[01:29:26.260 --> 01:29:28.540]   They say you can you can do anything you wanted Apple on your last day.
[01:29:28.540 --> 01:29:29.540]   Yeah.
[01:29:29.540 --> 01:29:37.260]   iPhone 10 sets new record for resale value, 85% on average of retail price.
[01:29:37.260 --> 01:29:40.100]   That's a pretty good good percentage.
[01:29:40.100 --> 01:29:41.100]   Yeah.
[01:29:41.100 --> 01:29:43.900]   One of the things that when you discuss the value proposition of an iPhone, like you have
[01:29:43.900 --> 01:29:47.940]   the iPhone itself and you know what that costs you, but you factor in if you're near
[01:29:47.940 --> 01:29:51.340]   an Apple store, all the free classes, you can get also the resale value.
[01:29:51.340 --> 01:29:56.260]   And traditionally you we have people on our forums that buy every new iPhone every year
[01:29:56.260 --> 01:29:57.260]   and sell it.
[01:29:57.260 --> 01:30:00.300]   And I think it's a growth industry for them.
[01:30:00.300 --> 01:30:01.300]   Yeah.
[01:30:01.300 --> 01:30:02.300]   But but it's it.
[01:30:02.300 --> 01:30:03.300]   That's always a good point.
[01:30:03.300 --> 01:30:06.820]   That's part of what's not really always brings that up because it's an important part
[01:30:06.820 --> 01:30:10.420]   of the discussion where people don't when people say that Apple stuff always costs more will
[01:30:10.420 --> 01:30:14.380]   oftentimes it lasts longer and you get better resale for it.
[01:30:14.380 --> 01:30:19.380]   But another part of that is you always hear about how spending $350 on a pair of leather
[01:30:19.380 --> 01:30:24.380]   boots is economical because these boots will last you 15 years as opposed to the $100 pair
[01:30:24.380 --> 01:30:29.260]   that you'll have to replace at least like four times in that same in that same era.
[01:30:29.260 --> 01:30:35.260]   However, a lot of people will never have $350 at one point to spend on a pair of boots.
[01:30:35.260 --> 01:30:36.940]   They have to buy they have to go to Walmart.
[01:30:36.940 --> 01:30:38.700]   They have to buy the cheap off brand.
[01:30:38.700 --> 01:30:43.500]   So a lot of people it would be not one of the reasons why it's a good idea for Apple
[01:30:43.500 --> 01:30:50.780]   to reach out to people with lower income is that they won't have the $650 to spend on
[01:30:50.780 --> 01:30:52.460]   the second tier iPhone.
[01:30:52.460 --> 01:30:55.580]   They only have $250 or $300 to spend.
[01:30:55.580 --> 01:30:59.420]   So then those resale values are absolutely nothing but still that's that's what they
[01:30:59.420 --> 01:31:01.220]   can actually put the money together for.
[01:31:01.220 --> 01:31:07.220]   I give you the iPhone photography award winners for 2018.
[01:31:07.220 --> 01:31:12.380]   These are done with an iPhone just beautiful images.
[01:31:12.380 --> 01:31:13.380]   This is from Mac.
[01:31:13.380 --> 01:31:17.060]   I think I did not put a fish in your eye.
[01:31:17.060 --> 01:31:22.020]   I know it's but just show I mean this is a smart thing for Apple to do.
[01:31:22.020 --> 01:31:29.900]   Yeah, which is highlight the the way of sinus or this is a Tim Cook's tweet and speaking
[01:31:29.900 --> 01:31:38.940]   of tweets Gary Vaynerchuk says the planet of the apps failed because Apple didn't market
[01:31:38.940 --> 01:31:39.940]   it right.
[01:31:39.940 --> 01:31:43.100]   No, it was a long no.
[01:31:43.100 --> 01:31:45.100]   No, no, no.
[01:31:45.100 --> 01:31:47.100]   Oh my God.
[01:31:47.100 --> 01:31:48.100]   It was the worst show.
[01:31:48.100 --> 01:31:51.380]   He said the worst show I've ever seen but wow.
[01:31:51.380 --> 01:31:56.940]   Gary said I was like F this.
[01:31:56.940 --> 01:31:58.380]   It was just a bad show Gary.
[01:31:58.380 --> 01:31:59.380]   It's not your fault.
[01:31:59.380 --> 01:32:00.380]   I know it was a bad show.
[01:32:00.380 --> 01:32:01.380]   It was just a bad show.
[01:32:01.380 --> 01:32:04.980]   First to first to production value to the terrible show.
[01:32:04.980 --> 01:32:10.380]   Now remember Gary who I know well and love does run a marketing company and I think his
[01:32:10.380 --> 01:32:14.700]   chief complaint was why did an Apple use my marketing company because it would have
[01:32:14.700 --> 01:32:15.900]   done so much better.
[01:32:15.900 --> 01:32:16.900]   No Gary.
[01:32:16.900 --> 01:32:17.900]   It was a bad show.
[01:32:17.900 --> 01:32:20.420]   Yeah, there was no amount of marketing that was going to fix that.
[01:32:20.420 --> 01:32:22.580]   In fact, in a way had more people seen it.
[01:32:22.580 --> 01:32:23.580]   It would have been worse.
[01:32:23.580 --> 01:32:24.580]   It would have been worse.
[01:32:24.580 --> 01:32:28.940]   Well, and I think I think I think part of why Apple took the the foot off the gas is
[01:32:28.940 --> 01:32:34.700]   that they showed it at WWC and it would which is theoretically would be the prime audience
[01:32:34.700 --> 01:32:36.500]   to watch it.
[01:32:36.500 --> 01:32:40.860]   And I don't know what the reaction was but the word on the street was.
[01:32:40.860 --> 01:32:41.860]   It was not.
[01:32:41.860 --> 01:32:44.700]   Uptown does make a good point in our chatroom.
[01:32:44.700 --> 01:32:49.980]   It was hard to find and this is going to be the issue of putting a show on Apple music.
[01:32:49.980 --> 01:32:55.100]   Apple really before it launches all of these new shows it's being a billion dollars for
[01:32:55.100 --> 01:32:58.140]   does need to solve this problem I would say.
[01:32:58.140 --> 01:33:02.940]   I don't know if they I don't know if they wanted to be easy to find like you it's not
[01:33:02.940 --> 01:33:05.820]   said it's one thing to cancel it and have it disappear and it's another thing just not
[01:33:05.820 --> 01:33:08.620]   to you know not to have it show up everywhere.
[01:33:08.620 --> 01:33:12.060]   I think that I think that might have been part of the situation.
[01:33:12.060 --> 01:33:16.660]   I mean because when you see when when if you use Apple TV, I think it's not that hard
[01:33:16.660 --> 01:33:21.620]   when you look at discoverability about I open it up and I see the new you know, Apple
[01:33:21.620 --> 01:33:26.140]   already has a whole platform to show us stuff on TV shows and movies and everything else
[01:33:26.140 --> 01:33:29.820]   that they want to put that on because I'm already going there as a as an Apple TV.
[01:33:29.820 --> 01:33:30.820]   That's true.
[01:33:30.820 --> 01:33:31.820]   I would see it on my Apple TV.
[01:33:31.820 --> 01:33:32.820]   I did see it on my Apple TV.
[01:33:32.820 --> 01:33:33.820]   There was no question.
[01:33:33.820 --> 01:33:34.820]   Yeah.
[01:33:34.820 --> 01:33:36.700]   So there's a lot of people going to that.
[01:33:36.700 --> 01:33:38.660]   You know, we're not talking about finding it on iTunes.
[01:33:38.660 --> 01:33:42.620]   We're talking about finding it on your Apple TV interface when you say movies, you know,
[01:33:42.620 --> 01:33:46.220]   which I probably see a couple times a week.
[01:33:46.220 --> 01:33:48.940]   So you know, I think that it's it's going to be I think they're going to be able to launch
[01:33:48.940 --> 01:33:49.940]   stuff fairly effectively.
[01:33:49.940 --> 01:33:53.940]   Also, I just chose not to launch that one.
[01:33:53.940 --> 01:33:57.780]   It's the idea of this show and carpool karaoke.
[01:33:57.780 --> 01:34:02.940]   It seems like the perfect choices if you're trying to create original content.
[01:34:02.940 --> 01:34:06.540]   You're going to start with two shows that are really cheap to produce.
[01:34:06.540 --> 01:34:10.420]   You don't necessarily have like huge names associated with them that are going to be
[01:34:10.420 --> 01:34:12.020]   embarrassed by a failure.
[01:34:12.020 --> 01:34:17.860]   It seems like a good way to test out your ability to actually manage a production a production
[01:34:17.860 --> 01:34:21.980]   studio and see what it's like to actually distribute these things.
[01:34:21.980 --> 01:34:28.700]   You're not going to buy the rights to iRobot as a 30 part maxi series and launch with that.
[01:34:28.700 --> 01:34:34.780]   I don't think that I actually think a narrative would have been easier to do than this because
[01:34:34.780 --> 01:34:41.060]   you're just hiring a showrunner and a producer and that's a standard Hollywood model.
[01:34:41.060 --> 01:34:42.860]   You're going to buy into something that you like.
[01:34:42.860 --> 01:34:46.980]   That production process is so well known that I mean, you have to get the right script and
[01:34:46.980 --> 01:34:49.460]   you have to get the right people.
[01:34:49.460 --> 01:34:53.060]   The actual machine of it is not something Apple would figure out.
[01:34:53.060 --> 01:34:54.820]   And that's what they're not figuring it out now.
[01:34:54.820 --> 01:34:58.820]   When they're hiring out to have these shows done, those are being done by Hollywood showrunners
[01:34:58.820 --> 01:35:02.820]   with Hollywood producers with Hollywood, everything.
[01:35:02.820 --> 01:35:06.420]   There's nothing new about that process that's going on.
[01:35:06.420 --> 01:35:16.500]   I will say that I noticed a jump in quality when the karaoke started.
[01:35:16.500 --> 01:35:20.020]   Someone definitely said, "Okay, we're going to take out this and put this in and everything
[01:35:20.020 --> 01:35:23.740]   else to make this actually look good."
[01:35:23.740 --> 01:35:32.820]   But I think that as someone who does a lot of that, looking at the app show, they spent
[01:35:32.820 --> 01:35:34.660]   a lot of money on that.
[01:35:34.660 --> 01:35:35.660]   They did.
[01:35:35.660 --> 01:35:39.780]   They had the escalator from hell or to hell or from heaven.
[01:35:39.780 --> 01:35:40.780]   A lot of money.
[01:35:40.780 --> 01:35:41.780]   The escalator.
[01:35:41.780 --> 01:35:46.460]   See, this is where you knew this was going to be a failure.
[01:35:46.460 --> 01:35:50.260]   When they hear, well, there's this famous thing called the elevator pitch.
[01:35:50.260 --> 01:35:53.980]   It's like if you've got just the person you want in an elevator and you only had like
[01:35:53.980 --> 01:35:57.260]   30 seconds to pitch in the elevator, then, "Oh, wait, we should do that.
[01:35:57.260 --> 01:35:59.900]   But only let's make it an escalator, be an escalator pitch."
[01:35:59.900 --> 01:36:01.380]   You can't see somebody in an elevator.
[01:36:01.380 --> 01:36:02.380]   You've got to go to see them.
[01:36:02.380 --> 01:36:03.540]   So nationally, I'll see the escalator.
[01:36:03.540 --> 01:36:06.860]   They call it in television and movies, high concept.
[01:36:06.860 --> 01:36:09.500]   It almost always is a bad IT.
[01:36:09.500 --> 01:36:11.860]   It was the set.
[01:36:11.860 --> 01:36:13.660]   They spent a lot of money on that set.
[01:36:13.660 --> 01:36:14.660]   A lot of money.
[01:36:14.660 --> 01:36:17.660]   I mean, I'm going to be a guy with a lot of money.
[01:36:17.660 --> 01:36:19.660]   I'm going to be a guy with a lot of money.
[01:36:19.660 --> 01:36:20.660]   I'm going to be a guy with a lot of money.
[01:36:20.660 --> 01:36:21.660]   I'm going to be a guy with a lot of money.
[01:36:21.660 --> 01:36:22.660]   I'm going to be a guy with a lot of money.
[01:36:22.660 --> 01:36:23.660]   I'm going to be a guy with a lot of money.
[01:36:23.660 --> 01:36:24.660]   I'm going to be a guy with a lot of money.
[01:36:24.660 --> 01:36:25.660]   I'm going to be a guy with a lot of money.
[01:36:25.660 --> 01:36:26.660]   I'm going to be a guy with a lot of money.
[01:36:26.660 --> 01:36:27.660]   I'm going to be a guy with a lot of money.
[01:36:27.660 --> 01:36:28.660]   I'm going to be a guy with a lot of money.
[01:36:28.660 --> 01:36:29.660]   I'm going to be a guy with a lot of money.
[01:36:29.660 --> 01:36:30.660]   I'm going to be a guy with a lot of money.
[01:36:30.660 --> 01:36:31.660]   I'm going to be a guy with a lot of money.
[01:36:31.660 --> 01:36:50.660]   I'm going to be a guy with a lot of money.
[01:36:50.660 --> 01:36:57.660]   I'm going to be a guy with a lot of money.
[01:36:57.660 --> 01:37:02.660]   I'm going to be a guy with a lot of money.
[01:37:02.660 --> 01:37:09.660]   I'm going to be a guy with a lot of money.
[01:37:09.660 --> 01:37:16.660]   I'm going to be a guy with a lot of money.
[01:37:16.660 --> 01:37:23.660]   I'm going to be a guy with a lot of money.
[01:37:23.660 --> 01:37:28.660]   I'm going to be a guy with a lot of money.
[01:37:28.660 --> 01:37:33.660]   I'm going to be a guy with a lot of money.
[01:37:33.660 --> 01:37:38.660]   I'm going to be a guy with a lot of money.
[01:37:38.660 --> 01:37:43.660]   I'm going to be a guy with a lot of money.
[01:37:43.660 --> 01:37:50.660]   I'm going to be a guy with a lot of money.
[01:37:50.660 --> 01:37:57.660]   If you are a designer or a developer, WordPress, as you know, is the sky is the limit, but you don't have to be.
[01:37:57.660 --> 01:37:58.660]   It's totally hassle-free.
[01:37:58.660 --> 01:38:03.660]   WordPress takes care of the hosting, the security, the software updates.
[01:38:03.660 --> 01:38:04.660]   You focus on your site.
[01:38:04.660 --> 01:38:09.660]   I've used WordPress for years, but I was, for a long time, hosting it myself, when I discovered WordPress.com,
[01:38:09.660 --> 01:38:14.660]   where they do all the hard stuff, including keeping it up to date and secure.
[01:38:14.660 --> 01:38:20.660]   The hosting is less than I was paying for my host. I said, "It's crazy."
[01:38:20.660 --> 01:38:25.660]   Why aren't I so immediately moved everything to WordPress.com? $4 a month.
[01:38:25.660 --> 01:38:27.660]   That's what it starts at.
[01:38:27.660 --> 01:38:28.660]   Of course, the best support in the world.
[01:38:28.660 --> 01:38:31.660]   They're there 24 hours a day, Monday through Friday.
[01:38:31.660 --> 01:38:35.660]   On weekends too, you can upload images, video, audio, and more important.
[01:38:35.660 --> 01:38:38.660]   Export your content to and from your WordPress website.
[01:38:38.660 --> 01:38:40.660]   You're never locked in, but you never want to leave.
[01:38:40.660 --> 01:38:41.660]   Trust me.
[01:38:41.660 --> 01:38:46.660]   Built-in SEO, as you grow, social media features like social media linking,
[01:38:46.660 --> 01:38:51.660]   which means your customers or fans can share the good news about you,
[01:38:51.660 --> 01:38:55.660]   to their websites, to their Facebook page, to their Twitter feed.
[01:38:55.660 --> 01:38:57.660]   Great marketing tools too.
[01:38:57.660 --> 01:39:02.660]   With the WordPress app on iOS or Android, you can manage your site on the go.
[01:39:02.660 --> 01:39:05.660]   Actually, they have it for Mac and Windows too.
[01:39:05.660 --> 01:39:07.660]   You're going to love WordPress.
[01:39:07.660 --> 01:39:12.660]   I don't have to really convince you, because 31% of all the websites in the world
[01:39:12.660 --> 01:39:13.660]   run on WordPress.
[01:39:13.660 --> 01:39:15.660]   That should tell you something.

[01:39:38.660 --> 01:39:40.660]   I thank you for that.
[01:39:40.660 --> 01:39:42.660]   Andy and Ico, your pick of the week.
[01:39:42.660 --> 01:39:45.660]   Mine is a quickie and it's just a YouTube channel.
[01:39:45.660 --> 01:39:50.660]   It's the Photoshop training channel that I started watching for the past two or three weeks,
[01:39:50.660 --> 01:39:55.660]   as I'm doing a lot more ambitious photo editing of my stuff in Lightroom and in Photoshop.
[01:39:55.660 --> 01:39:59.660]   YouTube is always great because if there's something you don't know how to do and you want to do it,
[01:39:59.660 --> 01:40:02.660]   you Google YouTube search for it, you'll find a video for it.
[01:40:02.660 --> 01:40:06.660]   But oftentimes it's garbage or the person's.
[01:40:06.660 --> 01:40:10.660]   He's one of these people who shop speaks and as useful as the information is,
[01:40:10.660 --> 01:40:13.660]   you can't listen to it for more than 30 seconds.
[01:40:13.660 --> 01:40:17.660]   But I love the Photoshop training channel because it's full of just one and done.
[01:40:17.660 --> 01:40:19.660]   Here's how you do this thing.
[01:40:19.660 --> 01:40:22.660]   As well as the handier, here are five things in Lightroom.
[01:40:22.660 --> 01:40:25.660]   You probably don't know how to do, but you probably should know how to do.
[01:40:25.660 --> 01:40:26.660]   They're well produced.
[01:40:26.660 --> 01:40:31.660]   They're really, really handy and they're perfect for, again, that situation where you've got
[01:40:31.660 --> 01:40:36.660]   a picture in front of you, you've realized that the colors are off in just this one section of it.
[01:40:36.660 --> 01:40:39.660]   You've been screwing it up for the past 10 minutes.
[01:40:39.660 --> 01:40:43.660]   I'll go to Photoshop training channel, see what video they have on that and I'll be darned.
[01:40:43.660 --> 01:40:47.660]   They've got a video specifically on that problem.
[01:40:47.660 --> 01:40:51.660]   My difficulty is that I've been using Photoshop and Lightroom for years.
[01:40:51.660 --> 01:40:59.660]   And by now, I've just come to realize how much of it I'm not using because I've trained myself
[01:40:59.660 --> 01:41:04.660]   to do things wrong, to get a certain result that kind of works.
[01:41:04.660 --> 01:41:09.660]   Whereas there's a much better way to get the solution that absolutely works and we'll do it in five seconds
[01:41:09.660 --> 01:41:11.660]   instead of like 50 hours.
[01:41:11.660 --> 01:41:16.660]   So a lot of great, a lot of good training channels out there, but I've been really, really
[01:41:16.660 --> 01:41:19.660]   exploiting Photoshop training training on YouTube.
[01:41:19.660 --> 01:41:21.660]   Very nice.
[01:41:21.660 --> 01:41:24.660]   Mr. Renee Ritchie, what do you like this week?
[01:41:24.660 --> 01:41:26.660]   I don't know the Pokemon picture, you Leo.
[01:41:26.660 --> 01:41:30.660]   Oh, good.
[01:41:30.660 --> 01:41:32.660]   So there was this Pokemon Go Plus and I recommended it previously.
[01:41:32.660 --> 01:41:34.660]   And that was a little Bluetooth device.
[01:41:34.660 --> 01:41:37.660]   You connected it to your app and you would press a button and it would throw balls to catch Pokemon
[01:41:37.660 --> 01:41:39.660]   or spin stops for you.
[01:41:39.660 --> 01:41:44.660]   But now there's this third party, I don't know if it's black market, it's not made by Nintendo
[01:41:44.660 --> 01:41:51.660]   or by the Pokemon company, but it uses the same protocols as the Pokemon Go Plus.
[01:41:51.660 --> 01:41:54.660]   I really think it's a hacked, like Xiaomi Mi device.
[01:41:54.660 --> 01:41:56.660]   Oh, interesting.
[01:41:56.660 --> 01:42:00.660]   And it basically does everything the Pokemon Go Plus does, but does it automatically.
[01:42:00.660 --> 01:42:03.660]   So you basically, you turn it on and you don't have to press any buttons, you don't have to
[01:42:03.660 --> 01:42:08.660]   click anything, you just go out for your walk, you go about your business and it will catch
[01:42:08.660 --> 01:42:11.660]   Pokemon or it will spin stops or it will do both for you.
[01:42:11.660 --> 01:42:14.660]   And some people like it because they don't want to have to be looking down at their phones
[01:42:14.660 --> 01:42:18.660]   while they're out walking or jogging or they don't want to have to be distracted while they're out.
[01:42:18.660 --> 01:42:21.660]   They just want, they want it handled for them.
[01:42:21.660 --> 01:42:23.660]   I think that's cheating.
[01:42:23.660 --> 01:42:26.660]   Yeah, so I don't know how I feel about it yet because I haven't used it.
[01:42:26.660 --> 01:42:28.660]   My worry, of course, is more selfish.
[01:42:28.660 --> 01:42:32.660]   I'm afraid I'll lose like shiny Pokemon because it'll throw a regular dumbball at it and
[01:42:32.660 --> 01:42:36.660]   they'll run away from me and I'll see it in my journal and I'll cry forever.
[01:42:36.660 --> 01:42:39.660]   It's very much lowest common denominator Pokemon hunting.
[01:42:39.660 --> 01:42:42.660]   Yeah, it's for people who want to grind, you want to just get as much experience or start
[01:42:42.660 --> 01:42:46.660]   as this, but because so many people are asking about it, I thought I would get one and try
[01:42:46.660 --> 01:42:47.660]   it out.
[01:42:47.660 --> 01:42:50.660]   So far I like it less, but other people might like it more.
[01:42:50.660 --> 01:42:51.660]   You have the other one.
[01:42:51.660 --> 01:42:54.660]   I have the Go Plus and I use that a lot when I'm walking and I don't want to take the phone
[01:42:54.660 --> 01:42:58.660]   out of my pocket, but I usually just put it on stops and it just spins the stops for me
[01:42:58.660 --> 01:42:59.660]   and doesn't, the watch...
[01:42:59.660 --> 01:43:01.660]   That's actually the best thing, right?
[01:43:01.660 --> 01:43:03.660]   Just collect all of that stuff, yeah.
[01:43:03.660 --> 01:43:04.660]   Yeah.
[01:43:04.660 --> 01:43:07.660]   And it does it while you're doing raids and while you're doing other things so you can actually
[01:43:07.660 --> 01:43:09.660]   double play a little bit.
[01:43:09.660 --> 01:43:10.660]   Go ahead, Andy.
[01:43:10.660 --> 01:43:12.660]   I hear somebody dissing Pokemon Go.
[01:43:12.660 --> 01:43:15.660]   I'm not dissing Pokemon Go, okay?
[01:43:15.660 --> 01:43:18.660]   I've never intentionally...
[01:43:18.660 --> 01:43:20.660]   He finds us at the World War.
[01:43:20.660 --> 01:43:23.660]   No, again, there's...
[01:43:23.660 --> 01:43:28.660]   Sometimes you get so much pleasure out of the pleasure someone else is visibly getting from
[01:43:28.660 --> 01:43:31.660]   something, even if it's something that you don't get yourself.
[01:43:31.660 --> 01:43:32.660]   Yes.
[01:43:32.660 --> 01:43:35.660]   So they've changed the sorting on friends now again.
[01:43:35.660 --> 01:43:36.660]   I don't know what I'm seeing here.
[01:43:36.660 --> 01:43:38.660]   They did an update yesterday and they announced...
[01:43:38.660 --> 01:43:40.660]   So first of all, Leo and Lisa and I are all best...
[01:43:40.660 --> 01:43:41.660]   Not best, but...
[01:43:41.660 --> 01:43:42.660]   They're all great friends now.
[01:43:42.660 --> 01:43:43.660]   Yes, great friends.
[01:43:43.660 --> 01:43:44.660]   Like super duper...
[01:43:44.660 --> 01:43:45.660]   They announced Lucky Pokemon now, Leo.
[01:43:45.660 --> 01:43:48.660]   So if you do a trade, you have a chance of getting a Lucky Pokemon.
[01:43:48.660 --> 01:43:51.660]   Oh, well, we'll be trading back and forth then quite a bit.
[01:43:51.660 --> 01:43:52.660]   Yes.
[01:43:52.660 --> 01:43:54.660]   Now I have to be in proximity to trade with you, right?
[01:43:54.660 --> 01:43:55.660]   Yes.
[01:43:55.660 --> 01:43:58.660]   So you only sell a higher likelihood of getting a Lucky Pokemon.
[01:43:58.660 --> 01:43:59.660]   Yeah.
[01:43:59.660 --> 01:44:01.660]   Me and Lisa back and forth.
[01:44:01.660 --> 01:44:02.660]   There you go.
[01:44:02.660 --> 01:44:03.660]   All right.
[01:44:03.660 --> 01:44:07.660]   By the way, all three of us are maxed out of 200 friends.
[01:44:07.660 --> 01:44:08.660]   Yes.
[01:44:08.660 --> 01:44:09.660]   Sorry.
[01:44:09.660 --> 01:44:10.660]   And there's no...
[01:44:10.660 --> 01:44:14.660]   I was trying to delete something to make room for others and it's just so difficult to delete people that I gave up.
[01:44:14.660 --> 01:44:15.660]   Yeah.
[01:44:15.660 --> 01:44:17.660]   I still enjoy this.
[01:44:17.660 --> 01:44:18.660]   This is a really fun game.
[01:44:18.660 --> 01:44:21.660]   The other day, Lisa and I, we now have started taking walks in the evening.
[01:44:21.660 --> 01:44:22.660]   See, it's really good.
[01:44:22.660 --> 01:44:23.660]   It's right.
[01:44:23.660 --> 01:44:24.660]   Yeah.
[01:44:24.660 --> 01:44:26.660]   And we were walking through a park that's a really good place.
[01:44:26.660 --> 01:44:27.660]   It's got a nest.
[01:44:27.660 --> 01:44:29.660]   I think it's a Diglett nest.
[01:44:29.660 --> 01:44:31.660]   It's got three...
[01:44:31.660 --> 01:44:33.660]   Three stops.
[01:44:33.660 --> 01:44:35.660]   There's a gym right next door.
[01:44:35.660 --> 01:44:37.660]   It's a wonderful, wonderful area.
[01:44:37.660 --> 01:44:40.660]   There's a bunch of teenagers sitting at a picnic table.
[01:44:40.660 --> 01:44:42.660]   They shout, "Are you...
[01:44:42.660 --> 01:44:43.660]   Pokey hunting?"
[01:44:43.660 --> 01:44:45.660]   We said, "Yeah!"
[01:44:45.660 --> 01:44:49.660]   And I said, "More importantly, are you valor?"
[01:44:49.660 --> 01:44:51.660]   And they said, "Yeah, valor!"
[01:44:51.660 --> 01:44:52.660]   Yeah, I am too.
[01:44:52.660 --> 01:44:53.660]   So they're all good-hearted people.
[01:44:53.660 --> 01:44:54.660]   Well, he said, "Is that red?"
[01:44:54.660 --> 01:44:56.660]   I said, "Yes, red."
[01:44:56.660 --> 01:45:14.660]   The nice thing, like for me, and I know Andy mentioned this when he moved, is that I'm in a new location and I was walking down the street and I saw what looked like a park and I would not see it from the road, but I went down the path and then turned and behind a bunch of really big-looking houses with a little tiny public park right on the river that was absolutely gorgeous.
[01:45:14.660 --> 01:45:17.660]   And there is no way I would ever have found it.
[01:45:17.660 --> 01:45:19.660]   I hadn't sort of followed those crumbs.
[01:45:19.660 --> 01:45:21.660]   And now I just get there sometimes and watch the water.
[01:45:21.660 --> 01:45:22.660]   Yeah.
[01:45:22.660 --> 01:45:29.660]   I'm walking with my free bass because apparently if you get 20 kilometers with your free bass, it just evolves all by itself.
[01:45:29.660 --> 01:45:30.660]   You have to still...
[01:45:30.660 --> 01:45:32.660]   Let's you evolve it into a melodic.
[01:45:32.660 --> 01:45:33.660]   Oh, okay.
[01:45:33.660 --> 01:45:35.660]   You already all knew about that.
[01:45:35.660 --> 01:45:37.660]   No, it's one of those...
[01:45:37.660 --> 01:45:39.660]   It's always new and always changing every time.
[01:45:39.660 --> 01:45:46.660]   I do admire them a little bit for that. They finally got the idea that, you know, let's add new features all the time.
[01:45:46.660 --> 01:45:47.660]   Yeah.
[01:45:47.660 --> 01:45:48.660]   Let's really...
[01:45:48.660 --> 01:45:51.660]   And boy, I think a lot more people are playing it.
[01:45:51.660 --> 01:45:54.660]   I think they looked at Fortnite and said, "Why are we getting some of that million and a half bucks at Shrin?"
[01:45:54.660 --> 01:45:56.660]   I tried that crazy...
[01:45:56.660 --> 01:46:06.660]   The Japanese have this thing called wafu rating and it's become popular other places where basically you try to do as many as you can in a row and they go in, they start, and they immediately drive to the next one.
[01:46:06.660 --> 01:46:08.660]   I managed to do 35 and three hours.
[01:46:08.660 --> 01:46:09.660]   What?
[01:46:09.660 --> 01:46:11.660]   They get 55 in an hour.
[01:46:11.660 --> 01:46:14.660]   And they think of all these different competitive things to do.
[01:46:14.660 --> 01:46:16.660]   It's amazing what kind of subculture is bubble up.
[01:46:16.660 --> 01:46:18.660]   You can't really raid by yourself, right?
[01:46:18.660 --> 01:46:19.660]   So what do you go with?
[01:46:19.660 --> 01:46:25.660]   No, so we have four people in a car which is enough for the ones that we're doing and then we just went from raid to raid.
[01:46:25.660 --> 01:46:29.660]   Well, madman, R&F, two things to pick.
[01:46:29.660 --> 01:46:37.660]   The first one I really like, I remember me dissing the touch bar.
[01:46:37.660 --> 01:46:38.660]   You remember that?
[01:46:38.660 --> 01:46:43.660]   Well, since I got a touch bar, I'm going to try to get the most I can out of it.
[01:46:43.660 --> 01:46:48.660]   And so I've downloaded Better Touch Bar, which you know about, I'm sure, right?
[01:46:48.660 --> 01:46:50.660]   Yeah, it's terrific.
[01:46:50.660 --> 01:46:53.660]   Yeah, it lets you completely customize your touch bar.
[01:46:53.660 --> 01:46:57.660]   I'm using somebody else's massive customization.
[01:46:57.660 --> 01:47:00.660]   Actually, you know, I have a screenshot of it.
[01:47:00.660 --> 01:47:02.660]   It might be easier to see this screen.
[01:47:02.660 --> 01:47:03.660]   Maybe not.
[01:47:03.660 --> 01:47:08.660]   But the idea is you can add new features to your touch bar.
[01:47:08.660 --> 01:47:09.660]   I've got battery life.
[01:47:09.660 --> 01:47:10.660]   You see 20 hours.
[01:47:10.660 --> 01:47:11.660]   You see that?
[01:47:11.660 --> 01:47:12.660]   You see that?
[01:47:12.660 --> 01:47:13.660]   You see that?
[01:47:13.660 --> 01:47:16.660]   I've got the date, the weather, control of my speakers.
[01:47:16.660 --> 01:47:18.660]   I've got emojis available.
[01:47:18.660 --> 01:47:24.660]   I have a show finder button because I'm always wanting to press the show finder button to open up the finder.
[01:47:24.660 --> 01:47:25.660]   You always have to go to the dock to do that.
[01:47:25.660 --> 01:47:31.660]   I've got my calendar, which when I press it automatically opens fantastical.
[01:47:31.660 --> 01:47:38.660]   I really like this, the full screen button, which will full screen whatever the front most app is automatically.
[01:47:38.660 --> 01:47:46.660]   And so this is, if you go to Better Touch Bar, you'll find this as the, well, it's in the community.
[01:47:46.660 --> 01:47:48.660]   Let me see if I can get there real quick.
[01:47:48.660 --> 01:47:50.660]   There's very different touch bar owners.
[01:47:50.660 --> 01:47:55.660]   Like some people just want shortcuts and some people just want data and some people want a blend of both of those.
[01:47:55.660 --> 01:47:57.660]   Like, glanceable data and shortcuts.
[01:47:57.660 --> 01:47:58.660]   It's a better touch tool.
[01:47:58.660 --> 01:48:00.660]   Let me get the name right.
[01:48:00.660 --> 01:48:02.660]   HolyVora.ai.
[01:48:02.660 --> 01:48:04.660]   HolyVora.ai.
[01:48:04.660 --> 01:48:11.660]   But if you go to the community, they have a lot of different, and there's a Reddit form as well, but they have a lot of,
[01:48:11.660 --> 01:48:17.660]   and frankly, I found it way overwhelming to configure it myself.
[01:48:17.660 --> 01:48:18.660]   Look at this.
[01:48:18.660 --> 01:48:20.660]   This is insane.
[01:48:20.660 --> 01:48:28.660]   So I'm really glad that there's community touch bars out there, and I just downloaded one of them from BetterTouchTool.net.
[01:48:28.660 --> 01:48:33.660]   And it's, I can't remember the name of it, but it's a very, very good.
[01:48:33.660 --> 01:48:36.660]   Let me see if I can find the.
[01:48:36.660 --> 01:48:42.660]   And you'll very quickly find what your preferences are just as you do that.
[01:48:42.660 --> 01:48:44.660]   What do you do with your touch tool?
[01:48:44.660 --> 01:48:49.660]   I like it for shortcuts because for some reason, like, I never, there's some apps like Photoshop and, you know,
[01:48:49.660 --> 01:48:54.660]   Final Cut that I remember the shortcuts, but there are other apps that I just used once in a while, and I can never remember them.
[01:48:54.660 --> 01:48:56.660]   And it comes up there, and I press the buttons.
[01:48:56.660 --> 01:49:00.660]   I also love it for things like Safari, because before they had the little tab icons,
[01:49:00.660 --> 01:49:04.660]   you never knew what tab was which, and it was so slow to go through and try to find tabs,
[01:49:04.660 --> 01:49:09.660]   but you could just swipe back and forth on the touch bar, and it would immediately show you every tab in a sequence,
[01:49:09.660 --> 01:49:10.660]   and I could find the one I wanted.
[01:49:10.660 --> 01:49:13.660]   So it was like little niche things like that, or just like spelling things.
[01:49:13.660 --> 01:49:14.660]   I was spelling a word wrong.
[01:49:14.660 --> 01:49:16.660]   It would always be there, and I could just tap on it.
[01:49:16.660 --> 01:49:21.660]   Yeah, I don't really want to spend that much time customizing it.
[01:49:21.660 --> 01:49:26.660]   So I'm using Golden Chaos, better touch tool, a complete touch bar UI.
[01:49:26.660 --> 01:49:27.660]   You just download it.
[01:49:27.660 --> 01:49:36.660]   It was a click, a link, and it downloads, and then you're going to want to go into it, and you can just uncheck the ones you don't want.
[01:49:36.660 --> 01:49:39.660]   It has a ton of stuff, and I just find this really handy.
[01:49:39.660 --> 01:49:44.660]   You know, there's things I'm playing with, like, having some, my Git commands there would be really nice.
[01:49:44.660 --> 01:49:50.660]   So as you're right, as you get more specific and you want some quick keys, this is the other thing I wanted to show you.
[01:49:50.660 --> 01:49:53.660]   This is from Hyper Drive.
[01:49:53.660 --> 01:49:55.660]   I've had a couple of these.
[01:49:55.660 --> 01:49:57.660]   These were Indie Go-Go's.
[01:49:57.660 --> 01:50:02.660]   This is the Hyper Drive Duo Hub for USB-C MacBook Pro 13 and 15.
[01:50:02.660 --> 01:50:04.660]   This works with the new one.
[01:50:04.660 --> 01:50:10.660]   I got it, of course, in the same color as my MacBook Pro, which comes with a little...
[01:50:10.660 --> 01:50:12.660]   Can you keep it in your belt, Leo?
[01:50:12.660 --> 01:50:14.660]   I could keep it on my belt.
[01:50:14.660 --> 01:50:15.660]   It's got a little belt loop.
[01:50:15.660 --> 01:50:19.660]   But this one's interesting because it uses both of the type Cs on the side there.
[01:50:19.660 --> 01:50:24.660]   It adds HDMI to type Cs, and that's why you got two.
[01:50:24.660 --> 01:50:27.660]   So one's for power and one's for something else.
[01:50:27.660 --> 01:50:30.660]   Card reader, this is what I'm going to take on my trip.
[01:50:30.660 --> 01:50:35.660]   So I have a compact way to have my card reader, and yeah, there's the little pouch.
[01:50:35.660 --> 01:50:38.660]   And let me just plug it in and show you it.
[01:50:38.660 --> 01:50:39.660]   Like that.
[01:50:39.660 --> 01:50:42.660]   You should be careful with these the one I had before.
[01:50:42.660 --> 01:50:43.660]   Broke off.
[01:50:43.660 --> 01:50:48.660]   You've got to, obviously, with something sticking out of the USB-C, you're going to want to make sure you're careful with it.
[01:50:48.660 --> 01:50:49.660]   You don't want to leave it plugged in.
[01:50:49.660 --> 01:50:51.660]   There's the light, and now everything is live.
[01:50:51.660 --> 01:50:53.660]   That's kind of cool, huh?
[01:50:53.660 --> 01:50:55.660]   It's about the only way you can make this.
[01:50:55.660 --> 01:51:01.660]   So you notice both of these picks are about making things I really don't like about the MacBook Pro.
[01:51:01.660 --> 01:51:02.660]   Useful.
[01:51:02.660 --> 01:51:03.660]   One is the lack of ports.
[01:51:03.660 --> 01:51:04.660]   The other is the...
[01:51:04.660 --> 01:51:07.660]   Well, if I got to live with the Touch Bar, I love the fingerprint reader.
[01:51:07.660 --> 01:51:08.660]   That's fantastic.
[01:51:08.660 --> 01:51:11.660]   But I do want the additional capabilities.
[01:51:11.660 --> 01:51:13.660]   And this is really nice to be able to do that.
[01:51:13.660 --> 01:51:17.660]   When you get to install software type in your password or Touch ID, you just touch it and you just touch it.
[01:51:17.660 --> 01:51:18.660]   And if that...
[01:51:18.660 --> 01:51:20.660]   That won me over big time.
[01:51:20.660 --> 01:51:23.660]   I'm so sick of tapping my password.
[01:51:23.660 --> 01:51:26.660]   Mr. Alex Lindsey, your pick of the week.
[01:51:26.660 --> 01:51:29.660]   By the 99 bucks for this Hyper Drive hub.
[01:51:29.660 --> 01:51:30.660]   Sorry.
[01:51:30.660 --> 01:51:32.660]   I want one really little one.
[01:51:32.660 --> 01:51:36.660]   If you haven't seen it, there's a designer on...
[01:51:36.660 --> 01:51:38.660]   And he's posting it on Facebook.
[01:51:38.660 --> 01:51:39.660]   And I put a link in here.
[01:51:39.660 --> 01:51:41.660]   We'll put it in the notes.
[01:51:41.660 --> 01:51:42.660]   But it is a...
[01:51:42.660 --> 01:51:43.660]   He takes the fonts that we...
[01:51:43.660 --> 01:51:45.660]   Or the logos that we see often.
[01:51:45.660 --> 01:51:47.660]   And just types in the font that they're using.
[01:51:47.660 --> 01:51:48.660]   Oh, that's nice.
[01:51:48.660 --> 01:51:49.660]   I think it's great.
[01:51:49.660 --> 01:51:50.660]   Yeah.
[01:51:50.660 --> 01:51:51.660]   And so he just has a bunch of popular ones.
[01:51:51.660 --> 01:51:52.660]   Hopefully he'll do more of them.
[01:51:52.660 --> 01:51:53.660]   But you'll see...
[01:51:53.660 --> 01:51:56.660]   I think it's right pinned at the top there.
[01:51:56.660 --> 01:52:05.660]   But if you click on it, it's like the YouTube logo, but it's listing off what the actual font is that they're using for that logo.
[01:52:05.660 --> 01:52:06.660]   Oh, very handy.
[01:52:06.660 --> 01:52:07.660]   And you're right.
[01:52:07.660 --> 01:52:10.660]   It's just really fun to kind of look at where...
[01:52:10.660 --> 01:52:12.660]   And I think there's only a handful of them.
[01:52:12.660 --> 01:52:14.660]   I'm hoping he puts more up there.
[01:52:14.660 --> 01:52:17.660]   But anyway, so that's a real quick one.
[01:52:17.660 --> 01:52:22.660]   In fonts, the equivalent of a perfect pitch where there are people who just look at a font and go, "Oh, yeah, that's not good."
[01:52:22.660 --> 01:52:27.660]   So when I used to be a print designer, I could get pretty close pretty fast.
[01:52:27.660 --> 01:52:35.660]   My skill set is not what it used to be, but I could get down to two or three fonts within just looking at something.
[01:52:35.660 --> 01:52:40.660]   I don't think that my eye isn't as tuned as it used to be.
[01:52:40.660 --> 01:52:42.660]   And there's a lot more fonts when I was doing it.
[01:52:42.660 --> 01:52:43.660]   Sure are.
[01:52:43.660 --> 01:52:44.660]   Yeah.
[01:52:44.660 --> 01:52:47.660]   And you'd always pick certain ones, but it's just kind of a fun...
[01:52:47.660 --> 01:52:49.660]   Oh, so Instagram uses Billabong.
[01:52:49.660 --> 01:52:51.660]   I never knew that.
[01:52:51.660 --> 01:52:52.660]   Yeah.
[01:52:52.660 --> 01:52:53.660]   We'll only use three fonts when we started.
[01:52:53.660 --> 01:52:54.660]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:52:54.660 --> 01:52:56.660]   I love Marriott Pro.
[01:52:56.660 --> 01:52:57.660]   What is that?
[01:52:57.660 --> 01:52:58.660]   Facebook?
[01:52:58.660 --> 01:52:59.660]   What's using Marriott Pro?
[01:52:59.660 --> 01:53:00.660]   Apple used to use Marriott Pro.
[01:53:00.660 --> 01:53:01.660]   That's the sound.
[01:53:01.660 --> 01:53:02.660]   Yeah.
[01:53:02.660 --> 01:53:03.660]   And I think we still use Marriott Pro.
[01:53:03.660 --> 01:53:04.660]   You know, so...
[01:53:04.660 --> 01:53:09.660]   But anyway, so it's just kind of a fun way as you go through those to see...
[01:53:09.660 --> 01:53:16.660]   What's surprising is how many companies are using, you know, like standard shelf off the shelf fonts?
[01:53:16.660 --> 01:53:18.660]   Yeah, well, and it's interesting.
[01:53:18.660 --> 01:53:22.660]   There's two thoughts there.
[01:53:22.660 --> 01:53:25.660]   You know, and people are now starting to move to their own fonts.
[01:53:25.660 --> 01:53:27.660]   So you'll see that Apple has San Francisco is not a public font.
[01:53:27.660 --> 01:53:30.660]   There's definitely a lot of companies that don't...
[01:53:30.660 --> 01:53:32.660]   that are starting to design their own.
[01:53:32.660 --> 01:53:35.660]   And they're oftentimes similar to something, but not the same.
[01:53:35.660 --> 01:53:36.660]   There's a couple of reasons for that.
[01:53:36.660 --> 01:53:38.660]   One is their look is their look.
[01:53:38.660 --> 01:53:41.660]   Another reason is they don't have to pay licensing for it.
[01:53:41.660 --> 01:53:42.660]   They own it.
[01:53:42.660 --> 01:53:48.660]   Yeah, it's cheaper to have someone build a logo than to constantly be paying for everybody in the whole company to use that font.
[01:53:48.660 --> 01:53:49.660]   I pay...
[01:53:49.660 --> 01:53:51.660]   And then all the external contractors.
[01:53:51.660 --> 01:53:57.660]   This font on our site, this one of the big letters, I pay somebody every month for that.
[01:53:57.660 --> 01:54:02.660]   I can't remember what it is, but it's a very nice font, but we, you know, we pay for it because we...
[01:54:02.660 --> 01:54:03.660]   Because I wanted it.
[01:54:03.660 --> 01:54:04.660]   Yeah.
[01:54:04.660 --> 01:54:05.660]   Yeah.
[01:54:05.660 --> 01:54:06.660]   Yeah.
[01:54:06.660 --> 01:54:08.660]   So that's a real quick one.
[01:54:08.660 --> 01:54:11.660]   The other one that is groundbreaking is I work.
[01:54:11.660 --> 01:54:12.660]   What?
[01:54:12.660 --> 01:54:14.660]   Come on.
[01:54:14.660 --> 01:54:16.660]   I use it so much now.
[01:54:16.660 --> 01:54:18.660]   So the thing is, is that it is...
[01:54:18.660 --> 01:54:21.660]   They have really started to get this all working.
[01:54:21.660 --> 01:54:22.660]   I just want to...
[01:54:22.660 --> 01:54:28.660]   If you've got I work on your computer, which a lot of people who are listening to, and you don't use it because you're using something else,
[01:54:28.660 --> 01:54:30.660]   I'm not saying that it's for everything.
[01:54:30.660 --> 01:54:33.660]   If you're dealing with a lot of people that you have to give them word files or whatever, it's fine.
[01:54:33.660 --> 01:54:35.660]   But one of the things that we've been doing a lot of...
[01:54:35.660 --> 01:54:44.660]   What I'm doing a lot of is going back and forth between my iPad and my computer, and it is just really smooth.
[01:54:44.660 --> 01:54:46.660]   So, you know, like when I'm...
[01:54:46.660 --> 01:54:47.660]   I used to...
[01:54:47.660 --> 01:54:52.660]   I think I talked earlier about using a card view to kind of think of my keynotes.
[01:54:52.660 --> 01:54:54.660]   Now I just use keynotes on the iPad.
[01:54:54.660 --> 01:54:55.660]   I just draw it all out.
[01:54:55.660 --> 01:54:57.660]   I create another slide and I draw it all out.
[01:54:57.660 --> 01:55:04.660]   Then I have all everything handwritten and drawn out and little diagrams of what I want and everything else is very creative.
[01:55:04.660 --> 01:55:05.660]   Then I bring it...
[01:55:05.660 --> 01:55:06.660]   Then I, you know, is on iCloud.
[01:55:06.660 --> 01:55:16.660]   I open up keynotes on my computer when I get back to the office because then what's happening for me is that I'm trying to not bring my laptop home.
[01:55:16.660 --> 01:55:25.660]   And so I'm trying to just kind of like leave that stuff there, but I still have my iPad and I have my pencil and I just draw out things that I want.
[01:55:25.660 --> 01:55:27.660]   And the process...
[01:55:27.660 --> 01:55:33.660]   What really got me also was in pages where you open up your iPad and you just really want the MacBook to be able to do it.
[01:55:33.660 --> 01:55:36.660]   The MacBook to be able to draw it because I'm like, "Oh, I want a picture here."
[01:55:36.660 --> 01:55:42.660]   And you start drawing into your pages doc of this is where I'm going to put a picture and this is how I'm going to work on it.
[01:55:42.660 --> 01:55:49.660]   And we started doing a lot of the collaborations where you send someone, you know, and that's become seamless.
[01:55:49.660 --> 01:55:50.660]   It was not seamless when they started.
[01:55:50.660 --> 01:55:51.660]   It was a mess.
[01:55:51.660 --> 01:55:53.660]   You know, and there is...
[01:55:53.660 --> 01:56:01.660]   You know, it's not quite as responsive as Google Docs, but it's pretty darn close and pages just look so much nicer.
[01:56:01.660 --> 01:56:06.660]   Like when you put together a proposal in Google Docs, it looks like Google Docs.
[01:56:06.660 --> 01:56:09.660]   And when you put it together in Word, it takes a lot of work to make it look good.
[01:56:09.660 --> 01:56:10.660]   When you put...
[01:56:10.660 --> 01:56:14.660]   I've been building all these proposals for a variety of different things.
[01:56:14.660 --> 01:56:15.660]   And it's funny.
[01:56:15.660 --> 01:56:16.660]   I still...
[01:56:16.660 --> 01:56:23.660]   My process right now is I write it in notes because then it's just available on everything that I possibly am using and for that kind of thing.
[01:56:23.660 --> 01:56:28.660]   And then I usually for us to review it, what I used to do is...
[01:56:28.660 --> 01:56:35.660]   Well, what I still do a little bit now is still put in Google Docs because then people can, you know, cut it all up and, you know, our guys can log into it.
[01:56:35.660 --> 01:56:38.660]   But what I started to move to is just putting in pages and going to collaborate.
[01:56:38.660 --> 01:56:46.660]   And then you apply a theme in pages and it suddenly looks way better than you would do normally.
[01:56:46.660 --> 01:56:48.660]   It's just that the themes work really well.
[01:56:48.660 --> 01:56:56.660]   So I want to spend a lot of time, you know, looking at it and thinking about it, you know, all the color schemes and the font schemes and, you know, all those bits and pieces all just work.
[01:56:56.660 --> 01:56:58.660]   And suddenly it looks like a real report.
[01:56:58.660 --> 01:57:01.660]   It looks like a real thing, you know, that you would pay for.
[01:57:01.660 --> 01:57:05.660]   And now you sit there and just keep on editing from there.
[01:57:05.660 --> 01:57:06.660]   And it looks really nice.
[01:57:06.660 --> 01:57:14.660]   The other thing is that I've had to go back to Excel and Google Sheets recently because almost everything we do is in numbers.
[01:57:14.660 --> 01:57:25.660]   And, wow, if you're using Excel for small things, if you're using Excel for calculating, you know, huge, you know, data structures for science or for the eye-on-the-body.
[01:57:25.660 --> 01:57:29.660]   Or the IMF, you probably need to use Excel.
[01:57:29.660 --> 01:57:43.660]   If you are organizing your next show or your next little process or you're doing budgets, you know, small budgets for a single, you know, bit in piece, you're really living a hard life by using something other than numbers.
[01:57:43.660 --> 01:57:46.660]   Because numbers is not, doesn't scale as well as Excel.
[01:57:46.660 --> 01:57:51.660]   But when I say not, doesn't scale as well, it's kind of like, you know, it'll scale.
[01:57:51.660 --> 01:57:54.660]   I mean, it'll do a lot of complex bits and pieces.
[01:57:54.660 --> 01:58:00.660]   It will not do, you know, 40 sheets and with hundreds and hundreds of dependencies and so on and so forth.
[01:58:00.660 --> 01:58:02.660]   It might. I just haven't tried.
[01:58:02.660 --> 01:58:11.660]   But it is so smooth and so fast and the ability to take the, you know, build multiple tables onto one sheet.
[01:58:11.660 --> 01:58:14.660]   I mean, when you get used to that, you go back to Excel and you're like, what the?
[01:58:14.660 --> 01:58:18.660]   So anyway, I think a lot of people, you know, take it for granted because it comes for free.
[01:58:18.660 --> 01:58:23.660]   And there's a lot of things that, you know, I complain about, or I complained about a lot.
[01:58:23.660 --> 01:58:29.660]   Like I hated pages for a long time because it was so slow and it's just, I think the computer is caught up with it, you know, with what it's doing now.
[01:58:29.660 --> 01:58:33.660]   And keynote is in my industry is the standard. No one thinks about that.
[01:58:33.660 --> 01:58:39.660]   I mean, no one considers like using pages on a, on a, I mean, not on a page, but PowerPoint.
[01:58:39.660 --> 01:58:40.660]   Yeah.
[01:58:40.660 --> 01:58:42.660]   On stage, you know, like, no, let's not do that.
[01:58:42.660 --> 01:58:47.660]   We tell the client that you're using their PowerPoint slide, but then you converted it all to keynote.
[01:58:47.660 --> 01:58:53.660]   So, so, so the anyway, but, but I think that it's worth taking a look at it.
[01:58:53.660 --> 01:58:57.660]   And specifically, it's worth taking a look at how it interacts with the iPad, if you have a pencil,
[01:58:57.660 --> 01:59:04.660]   because your ability to sit there and play with ideas and draw on stuff and figure stuff out really makes it a much more creative process.
[01:59:04.660 --> 01:59:11.660]   And I have to admit, this is good at marketing from Apple because I wasn't really thinking that way until I saw their education, you know, presentation.
[01:59:11.660 --> 01:59:14.660]   And I was watching how the kids were doing it in their little ad.
[01:59:14.660 --> 01:59:18.660]   I didn't really think about that way and I started playing with it. And now it's just like part of my process.
[01:59:18.660 --> 01:59:26.660]   You know, so it's, it's definitely worth it's something that's, the only reason I wanted to bring it up is because it's something that we, that, you know, we take for granted a lot.
[01:59:26.660 --> 01:59:27.660]   Yeah.
[01:59:27.660 --> 01:59:35.660]   You know, and it's, they are from a creative perspective, especially they are, it's just a great collection of apps, you know, to develop your ideas into something that people can read.
[01:59:35.660 --> 01:59:43.660]   And I'm, you know, working very hard on teaching my kids how to take them, make the most of it for their, for their class projects and so on and so forth, because it's just a, it's a really good, good platform to work with.
[01:59:43.660 --> 01:59:44.660]   Good platform to work on.
[01:59:44.660 --> 01:59:45.660]   Yeah, 100%.
[01:59:45.660 --> 01:59:47.660]   Have you, you've been using the new collaborate stuff?
[01:59:47.660 --> 01:59:48.660]   Has it worked pretty well?
[01:59:48.660 --> 01:59:49.660]   It does.
[01:59:49.660 --> 01:59:52.660]   It didn't, when it launched it, it was a nightmare.
[01:59:52.660 --> 01:59:53.660]   Like it was just, it was just a mess.
[01:59:53.660 --> 01:59:55.660]   I was like, oh, this is never going to work.
[01:59:55.660 --> 01:59:58.660]   And then some of the folks in the office started, it's starting to work.
[01:59:58.660 --> 02:00:04.660]   And, and then in the last, in the last update, not the beta, but the last update, it has been just seamless.
[02:00:04.660 --> 02:00:12.660]   And, you know, now I'm on, I'm on calls with producer and both of us are looking at the same thing and we're editing it all and putting it all together and watching all the stuff appear and disappear.
[02:00:12.660 --> 02:00:14.660]   The way we would with a Google Doc.
[02:00:14.660 --> 02:00:16.660]   And, and it works great.
[02:00:16.660 --> 02:00:18.660]   And, yeah, definitely worth it.
[02:00:18.660 --> 02:00:20.660]   They've done a nice job.
[02:00:20.660 --> 02:00:22.660]   I'm going to have to take another look at it again.
[02:00:22.660 --> 02:00:23.660]   I mean, everybody's got it.
[02:00:23.660 --> 02:00:24.660]   That's the other advantage.
[02:00:24.660 --> 02:00:26.660]   Everybody's using a Mac, hasn't.
[02:00:26.660 --> 02:00:27.660]   Yeah.
[02:00:27.660 --> 02:00:28.660]   Thank you, Alex Lindsey.

[02:00:43.660 --> 02:00:44.660]   I'm back.
[02:00:44.660 --> 02:00:45.660]   I'm sorry.
[02:00:45.660 --> 02:00:46.660]   You're going to be back in town?
[02:00:46.660 --> 02:00:47.660]   Yeah, next week.
[02:00:47.660 --> 02:00:48.660]   Oh, good.
[02:00:48.660 --> 02:00:49.660]   We'll see you next week.
[02:00:49.660 --> 02:00:52.660]   You can touch my hot MacBook Pro.
[02:00:52.660 --> 02:00:55.660]   That's about either this or this.
[02:00:55.660 --> 02:00:56.660]   And we have a title.
[02:00:56.660 --> 02:00:57.660]   Show title.
[02:00:57.660 --> 02:00:58.660]   We should.
[02:00:58.660 --> 02:01:04.660]   Andy Inaco is at I-H-N-A-T-K-O.com.
[02:01:04.660 --> 02:01:06.660]   And he's not, not go on the Twitter.
[02:01:06.660 --> 02:01:09.660]   But he's Andy I on the Flickr.
[02:01:09.660 --> 02:01:10.660]   And he's got great pictures.
[02:01:10.660 --> 02:01:11.660]   Always a pleasure.
[02:01:11.660 --> 02:01:16.660]   I was, you always tell when I signed up for a service, I was on an Andy I kick forever until
[02:01:16.660 --> 02:01:20.660]   I decided, okay, I'm not going to get Andy I everywhere, but I need to get, I need to
[02:01:20.660 --> 02:01:26.660]   get Anaco now that I have cousins across the world that should, or are we in the internet?
[02:01:26.660 --> 02:01:28.660]   You just pit the bullet and you said, I don't care.
[02:01:28.660 --> 02:01:33.660]   I have no idea how to spell it myself, but I'm going to let everybody be Anaco eyes.
[02:01:33.660 --> 02:01:34.660]   Exactly.
[02:01:34.660 --> 02:01:35.660]   Thank you, Andrew.
[02:01:35.660 --> 02:01:37.660]   And Renee Richie, he's at I-Moor.com.
[02:01:37.660 --> 02:01:41.660]   So if Lori Gill runs I-Moor, what do you do?
[02:01:41.660 --> 02:01:43.660]   I help out with the whole network.
[02:01:43.660 --> 02:01:45.660]   So you're like mobile nations man.
[02:01:45.660 --> 02:01:50.660]   I try and I do a lot of the Apple coverage still because I just can't quit it.
[02:01:50.660 --> 02:01:52.660]   I don't know why I'm saying what do you do.
[02:01:52.660 --> 02:01:59.660]   You only write a million words a day, but I didn't realize you weren't in charge of day-to-day
[02:01:59.660 --> 02:02:00.660]   operations that I'm working.
[02:02:00.660 --> 02:02:03.660]   Now, Strenity took that over and now Lori has taken that over.
[02:02:03.660 --> 02:02:04.660]   Great.
[02:02:04.660 --> 02:02:05.660]   Well, you do vector.
[02:02:05.660 --> 02:02:06.660]   That keeps you pretty busy.
[02:02:06.660 --> 02:02:09.660]   In fact, before I bought the MacBook Pro, what did I do?
[02:02:09.660 --> 02:02:14.660]   I listened to your discussion about the I-9 processors on Vector.
[02:02:14.660 --> 02:02:15.660]   It's really good.
[02:02:15.660 --> 02:02:16.660]   I-Moor.com/vector.
[02:02:16.660 --> 02:02:19.660]   You and Cutrus, you brilliant guy from an Antech.
[02:02:19.660 --> 02:02:20.660]   Yeah.
[02:02:20.660 --> 02:02:21.660]   Can't wait to listen to that.
[02:02:21.660 --> 02:02:24.660]   Tomorrow I'll show his Bridger Maxwell who used to be at Apple and Melee.
[02:02:24.660 --> 02:02:26.660]   Whoa, who used to be on Apple's design team.
[02:02:26.660 --> 02:02:29.660]   They've got a new app for whiteboarding on my pad, which is fantastic.
[02:02:29.660 --> 02:02:30.660]   Oh, I saw that.
[02:02:30.660 --> 02:02:31.660]   Yeah.
[02:02:31.660 --> 02:02:32.660]   I'll be listening.
[02:02:32.660 --> 02:02:33.660]   Fantastic.
