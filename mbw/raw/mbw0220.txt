[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.040]   Let me tell you, here he is, Alex Lindsey from the Pixelcorpixacore.com
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.640]   for that guild of multimedia artists.
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.840]   Hello.
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:43.880]   Learning and working together.
[00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.400]   And of course, Pixelcorpix.tv for the podcast they produce.
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.280]   Hello, Alex.
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.880]   It's good to have you here.
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.200]   He's back, ladies and gentlemen, and he's ready.
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.280]   Look how good he looks.
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.920]   He's sharp.
[00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.800]   It's Mr. Merlin Mann.
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:55.200]   Hello, Leo.

[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.040]   Also, here with us, Mr. Andy Enoch--
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.080]   very thoughtful, Andy Enocho.
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.320]   He's pretending to be serious.
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.600]   He was the guy getting us in trouble for the last hour.
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.320]   How long can you hold it?
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.440]   How long can he hold it?
[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.880]   Look at that.
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.080]   He's very serious.
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.760]   I think it's a still, actually.
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.080]   No way him at the leaves behind him are moving.
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.840]   Andy works for the Chicago Sun Times
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.520]   and is a blogger at www.cwob.com.
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.480]   Hello, everybody.
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.080]   Hello.
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.960]   Gary Marshall.
[00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.200]   I almost hate to bring this up.
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.440]   We've been having so much fun.
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.920]   And now this, which is both serious and boring.
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.200]   Apple has killed the X-serve.
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.560]   Story 2.
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.520]   No, is there anything to say about that at all?
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.880]   I immediately thought of Alex.
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.320]   I immediately thought of Alex.
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.040]   And I should point out, I blame myself
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.640]   because we just bought an X-serve.
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.200]   Oh, you did it to us.
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:55.880]   You did it to us.
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:56.640]   We were fine.
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.360]   And then you had to buy an X-serve.
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.240]   We thought we were using--
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.120]   we have a SAN, Storage Area Network that records.
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.000]   Right now we're recording in Final Cut Pro on a Mac here,
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.640]   going through the fiber to the SAN.
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.720]   And you need a data controller for that.
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.960]   And we were using an old G5 Mac that we had lying around,
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:13.520]   quad G5.
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:14.640]   We felt that wasn't sufficient.
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.520]   So we went out.
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.880]   And literally, just a week or two ago, bought an X-serve.
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.120]   I'm glad we got one, actually, because I think these
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.040]   are still good machines.
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.600]   I think that the great machines, I think,
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.840]   that this furthers the conversation
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.440]   that we've been having over the last couple months
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.040]   about Apple not being interested in trucks.
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.240]   I mean, I think the X-serve is first.
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.840]   No kidding.
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.600]   As a user of a Mac Pro, I'm worried
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.040]   that the Mac Pros are three to five years down the road.
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.440]   We're not going to see any of those either.
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.520]   You saw the forum post where somebody from Apple said,
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.120]   oh, no, don't worry.
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.560]   We're still going to make Mac Pros at servers.
[00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.760]   And we're still very interested.
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.000]   And it was deleted.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.920]   Not don't know why, but some people say--
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:46.440]   Right.
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.320]   Well, maybe that this is not official policy.
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.480]   Apple's spending a lot of energy on iPhones, iPads.
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.720]   And netbooks, essentially.
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.120]   They can allow money, presumably.
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.120]   Not spending as much time.
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.800]   And the argument is that Steve's argument
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.920]   has been that we're not selling very many of them.
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.120]   But they tend to need a truck because if you don't have a truck,
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.840]   who's going to produce the content for these devices?
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:06.720]   There's an ecosystem.
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.560]   There's an ecosystem that is that we're giving up here.
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.320]   And I think that that's the real issue is you can no longer now
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.160]   have a completely Mac ecosystem, which I think
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.720]   affects a lot of things downstream.
[00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.680]   Well, the interesting thing is that every time I've
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.240]   seen a Mac OS X server in a server closet,
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.600]   it's never been a blade.
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.000]   It's always been a Mac mini.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.840]   So if you're wondering who's buying up all these Mac
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.520]   minis, it turns out that it's just an administrator.
[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:29.600]   If you make a server version--
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.160]   We have a lot of Mac minis.
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.920]   You can buy the Mac mini in a server configuration.
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.680]   And it is a lot more popular than you might think.
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.040]   I will say, we don't have any X-serves.
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.400]   Why would you need an X-serves?
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.200]   I think six Mac minis.
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.160]   X-serves faster, right?
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.200]   It's got faster processes.
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.880]   If you want to use it as a--
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:45.760]   there are a lot of things.
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:46.520]   It's more robust.
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.800]   It's got-- you can swap things out a lot easily.
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.520]   So if you're in a large environment,
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.720]   mac minis are not what you want because you can't put cards
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:53.040]   into them.
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.800]   You can't put extra drives into them.
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.600]   We put fiber channel, for instance, into our X-serv.
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.160]   We need that.
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.120]   It has to have fiber, right?
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.680]   Those types of things.
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.520]   Well, for instance, if you look at a Final Cut server,
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.560]   how do you run Final Cut server off of an X-SAN
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:04.840]   and all these other things?
[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.200]   I mean, you'll use a Mac Pro as what you're going to have--
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.480]   How about if you run OS X server on a Mac Pro?
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:10.280]   Isn't that a server?
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.320]   Yeah, it's just that it's a lot of room for something that's--
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.560]   You're taking up this huge rack space.
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.760]   And they're not even designed to go into a rack space.
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.920]   And so I think that this-- I do think, though,
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:24.560]   that this continues to make the argument that at some point,
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.840]   Apple needs to license or open source the old version of OS X
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.320]   because they got to give us the opportunity to put OS X--
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.300]   OS X-- OS X-- OS X-- OS X-- OS X-- OS X-- OS X-- OS X-- OS X--
[00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:36.640]   Or license.
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:42.280]   Well, I had the good fortune to be at the Mac Tech conference,
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.880]   which is a conference for IT professionals in LA.
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.400]   When this announcement came down.
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.320]   And at the time, I likened it to being fortunate to be in LA
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.480]   when the Rodney King verdict came down.
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.880]   Because there was a lot of discussion at breakfast
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.760]   about how this would affect their lives.
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.520]   And something that I heard from one person
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:04.280]   is that if Apple were to simply remove the restriction
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.000]   against virtualization on the server version of the OS,
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.360]   they don't feel as though this would be a big problem for them.
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.600]   Some of them actually explicitly said
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.240]   that if they don't remove the virtualization feature,
[00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.080]   the virtualization limitation now,
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.680]   I will be furious about this decision.
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.560]   Because the differences between people
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:25.000]   who are doing really the real kind of actual admin stuff,
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.180]   as opposed to the people who are just
[00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.960]   trying to support 10 or 20 users on file sharing,
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.880]   is different because a server-grade computer
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.800]   is a totally different beast from a consumer-grade machine.
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.600]   And so for a lot of these people, that
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.240]   means that they have to change everything,
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.440]   that they either change everything that they do with the Macintosh
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.680]   or wait for the inevitable market to pop up for people
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.920]   to buy Mac Pros and reassemble them into blades,
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.360]   like into server-grade machines and then resell them
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.520]   on the secondary market.
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:53.520]   We can be painful.
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:54.760]   >> Mac Pro also just kind of supports what everybody else
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:55.600]   has said, I guess.
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.200]   But the Mac Pro also has-- is that OK?
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:58.680]   Is that me?
[00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.080]   >> Yeah, no, that's me.
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.440]   Sorry.
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:02.840]   >> The Mac Pro has a really important role
[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.800]   as a giant asterisk on everything.
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:09.640]   So if you read any review of an iPad, an iPhone,
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.000]   especially the iPad and the MacBook Pro, Mac Book Air,
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.360]   though, I think Snell's was a Sneller.
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.160]   Yeah, he read the big MacBook Air one, right?
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.880]   It was like, well, you know, if you really need the firepower,
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.040]   you can still buy a Mac Pro.
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:19.840]   In fact, I've done that.
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:20.800]   >> It just comes up a lot.
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:21.640]   It comes up a lot.
[00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:22.480]   >> I bought both.
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:23.360]   I bought a Mac Pro recently.
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.360]   Like in the last month, Mac Pro and a Mac Book Air.
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:26.840]   And now I feel complete.
[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:28.200]   >> But it's like Nietzsche and that whole idea
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:29.840]   of the constellation of suicide.
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:32.000]   It's like knowing that the Mac Pro is there,
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.720]   even if they don't sell that many,
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:36.280]   gives them an asterisk to put out thinner.
[00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:37.120]   >> You still can.
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.360]   >> Well, does that make any sense?
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:39.600]   >> Yes, I think it does.
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.440]   And that's, but I mean, the point is,
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:42.880]   it's more than an asterisk.
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.080]   It needs to be there.
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.200]   It doesn't, you do need that part of the product line.
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:49.280]   >> Again, now if you want to run Final Cut Server,
[00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:51.080]   in those types of applications,
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.520]   you're in a situation where you have to have a Mac Pro to do it.
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:55.680]   It's completely for large companies
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:58.680]   that want to have a Mac infrastructure,
[00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:02.360]   have a Mac, a 100% Mac pipeline.
[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:03.840]   This is a massive hit.
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:05.800]   >> This is July, January 31st, this happens.
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.880]   Is it possible that they have something else,
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.360]   a 1U something that they,
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.080]   or is they just gonna kill the rack mounts?
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:11.920]   >> I don't think so.
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:12.760]   >> I think they're killing the rack mounts.
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:13.600]   >> No more rack mounts.
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.880]   >> I think this is, I still think I don't mean to be the,
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:16.720]   bare or bad news,
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:19.480]   but I really think this is an evolution
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:21.520]   away from all of the quote unquote trucks.
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:23.400]   And I think that this is as big as it's gonna be.
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:25.600]   >> I'm not sure I fully understand why you would kill a product
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.240]   that's selling presumably.
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.240]   >> Because it's not selling enough.
[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:30.560]   >> So you just don't want to stock it,
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:34.000]   even though it's kind of important for a business,
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.320]   let's say who wants to be, just as you said.
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.200]   >> I don't, isn't that important?
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.040]   >> I'll say I agree with it.
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:40.040]   I'm just saying that I think that this is the-
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:40.880]   >> Right, and you've got to,
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:43.480]   you've got to staff the kind of sales engineers
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:45.080]   that are gonna be in that channel.
[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.720]   It's more to it than just like,
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:47.640]   I obviously understand this,
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:49.320]   but there's more to it than just putting it in boxes
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.440]   and then keeping it around until somebody wants to buy it.
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:52.560]   There's a couple costs to that,
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.200]   but then there's just, I mean,
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.000]   there's things like whatever the trade shows,
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.440]   and there's all the support issues,
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:58.840]   like I would have to imagine.
[00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:01.800]   >> Well, they haven't been doing much trade shows at all.
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:02.840]   >> Trade shows, are there any,
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:05.000]   or any real support other than when you call
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:05.880]   and talk to someone,
[00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:07.960]   but there is, Merlin's completely correct
[00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:09.240]   that there's a lot of support.
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:10.240]   >> There's so much more support.
[00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:11.240]   >> More support that needs to be in there, yeah.
[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.080]   >> Because, man, I'll tell you,
[00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:13.840]   professional clients, when they buy machines
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:15.000]   and things don't work,
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:15.960]   they're not like consumers
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:17.200]   where they're willing to put up with it,
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.320]   there's a lot of angry calls and a lot of upset,
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.400]   'cause they spend a lot of money.
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:22.240]   >> Could we reduce our steps on the Mac mini thing though?
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:24.880]   'Cause I guess, I have been hearing
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:26.600]   something in between what you guys were saying.
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.760]   I've heard also that people are just buying
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:30.960]   crap tons of Mac minis to use,
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.440]   I guess as Andy was saying,
[00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:34.600]   I don't understand exactly why,
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:37.520]   but apparently they're close enough to a commodity
[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:39.640]   in some ways that you can buy a crap ton of these
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:40.840]   and serve a lot of your own needs.
[00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:42.640]   >> Well, there's a, I'm just thinking here,
[00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:44.960]   we have one, two, three, four, seven Mac minis,
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:47.120]   we have one extra, but we have seven Mac minis.
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:48.320]   >> And we've been looking at using them
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:51.120]   for our quick time compression and some of our rendering.
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.160]   >> But are they really fast enough?
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:53.880]   >> Yeah, well, there's two different ways of going.
[00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:57.440]   There are, you know, a quality versus quantity,
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:59.480]   and so when you're looking at rendering out
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:02.560]   to a lot of rendering out a lot of nodes,
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:06.120]   one way to go is to just have a lot of cheap nodes
[00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:08.080]   that when one fails or one needs to be replaced,
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:10.400]   you just pull it out and has a small effect on the total,
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.480]   or you spend a lot on each one.
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:13.880]   So for the price of one X-serve,
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:17.080]   you can buy, you know, four or five of these Mac minis.
[00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:18.640]   And so I think that the argument is,
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:19.480]   is then you have a bunch of them
[00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:20.840]   and they can all be doing different things
[00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:22.800]   and they can all, and that's a lot of processors
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:23.640]   between them all.
[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:25.760]   And now if they put, if they beefed up the Mac mini,
[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:28.520]   you know, a little bit, just bigger processors,
[00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:30.080]   you know, allow it to,
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:32.800]   then I think I would be less stressed about it.
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:34.640]   But the virtualization thing is also important.
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:37.400]   You know, I think that Apple needs to let us do that.
[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:41.000]   I mean, on the PC, we can have six instances of windows
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.680]   running on one Mac mini.
[00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:43.600]   And that's important for us,
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:45.800]   because we have stuff that doesn't require a lot of processor,
[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:48.000]   it's serving up keys,
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.840]   but we need to have lots of versions
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:50.880]   to run on the same machines.
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:53.040]   >> Well, it's no-blessing interesting question in the chat room.
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:55.120]   What is Apple.com run on?
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.560]   >> It probably runs in Linux and a server.
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:57.400]   >> Linux, Linux, Linux.
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:59.160]   >> It probably is, probably.
[00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:00.000]   >> And that might be why the--
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.320]   >> It's combination of Linux and Web objects, a lot of it.
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:03.160]   >> Right, and maybe it is.
[00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:04.960]   >> Well, I think that kind of answers the question.
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:06.560]   I mean, if Apple doesn't use them.
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:07.680]   >> Well, I'm curious what Pixar uses,
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:08.600]   because this--
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.600]   >> This are, we know now, uses PCs.
[00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:12.080]   >> Well, and this may have been--
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:16.560]   >> This may be the one of the things where you have a CEO
[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:18.080]   on both companies that looked at them,
[00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:20.000]   and Pixar says, you know, these just aren't what we need.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:20.840]   They're not what we want.
[00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:23.360]   >> I think, Tal, that manages their rendering stuff
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:25.000]   as you want me to find out.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   >> I think there was a cyber--
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:26.840]   >> I know, I mean--
[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:29.040]   >> Just recently that said Pixar is using PCs.
[00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:30.280]   >> Yeah, no, I think that they are.
[00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:34.120]   And I think that they, I think that that might have affected
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:36.640]   it, because they said, well, this company isn't going to use them,
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:37.800]   you know, and they're not solving it.
[00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:40.560]   I think I can see why Steve Jobs would say, well,
[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:41.400]   let's just--
[00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:45.040]   >> At SIGGRAPH, two years ago, Pixar said the RenderMan
[00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:48.520]   was going to be fully compatible with Windows.
[00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:49.720]   I know I saw a story--
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:50.560]   >> Well, I don't think they're running--
[00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:52.680]   I think they're running on PC infrastructure.
[00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:53.840]   I think they're running on Linux, though.
[00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:55.720]   I don't think they're running on Windows.
[00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:56.560]   >> They might--
[00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:57.840]   RenderMan may be compatible with Windows,
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:00.520]   but I don't think Pixar is running on Windows.
[00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:01.360]   I think they're running on Linux.
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:02.840]   >> Ping your buddy, Merlin.
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:03.760]   >> Mm-hmm, working on it.
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:04.600]   >> Let us know.
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:05.440]   >> Ping your buddy.
[00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:07.440]   It's completely confidential, we won't do it.
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:09.920]   >> I would be very surprised that a company--
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:10.760]   >> Here it is.
[00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:11.760]   >> I found the announcement.
[00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:12.760]   >> I was running on it.
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:15.840]   >> This was at a PDC, the Microsoft Professional Developers
[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:16.600]   Conference.
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:19.440]   Microsoft announced this.
[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:23.280]   Pixar uses Azure, the Windows--
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:24.960]   the Windows Cloud Solution.
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:29.960]   Pixar has put RenderMan on the Cloud
[00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:33.640]   via Windows, Azure Cloud Computing Platform,
[00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:35.160]   and Microsoft announced it.
[00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:39.560]   Microsoft announced it at their big event.
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:41.800]   So Pixar doesn't even mind that this is knowledge.
[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:44.160]   >> Can I ask a real dumb, new question, Alex?
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:46.600]   What is it about Apple or--
[00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:48.400]   is it the integration with Final Cut?
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:52.960]   What is it that you can't do with something like Linux?
[00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:54.640]   >> Well, for instance, I mean, there's
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:57.080]   a lot of stuff that we use that is based on X-SAN.
[00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:59.240]   So we've got software and we've got things.
[00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:01.920]   And that's all something that's wired into--
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:02.280]   >> I don't--
[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:03.000]   >> It's an Apple product.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:03.960]   >> It's an Apple product.
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:06.440]   And no, it's not that it's impossible.
[00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:08.680]   It's just that there are a lot of Mac tools
[00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:09.840]   that we want to use.
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:11.880]   And for instance, if we want to run Final Cut on up,
[00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:14.120]   if you want to have something that is RackMountable,
[00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:16.960]   that we can run some of the Mac stuff on it,
[00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:19.600]   we can use all the Mac tools, use the Mac knowledge
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:22.040]   that we have, we don't have to worry about.
[00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:23.960]   So there's a lot of things that, you know,
[00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:27.640]   administrating a Linux or Windows environment
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.600]   is much more complicated, in our opinion,
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.160]   than administrating an OS 10 client.
[00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:32.680]   And we do both.
[00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:34.440]   I mean, we have a lot of our servers that are running on Windows
[00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:36.240]   and a lot of our servers that are running on Mac.
[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:38.360]   So it's not-- and some of them are running on Linux.
[00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:39.920]   So it's not that it's one way or the other.
[00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:43.000]   It's just that taking that out of the pipeline, for us,
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:43.920]   I think, you know, we'll be fine.
[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:45.120]   We'll do whatever we're going to do.
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:46.760]   But I think there are people who have wanted
[00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:50.200]   to have 100% Mac platform with all the tools
[00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:52.560]   and they have it all working and it's a lower impact
[00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:54.200]   on their IT and so on and so forth.
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:55.720]   And that's going to be taken away from them.
[00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:58.040]   And the problem is, I think, that when IT,
[00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:00.520]   when that goes away from IT, it also weakens
[00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:03.520]   that central point of companies who
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:05.600]   are moving towards the Mac platform.
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:08.920]   You're weakening the Mac IT folks who
[00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:10.640]   are in those companies usually campaigning
[00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:14.360]   to have more iPhones, more Macs being bought for them.
[00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:17.200]   And when you take out that central piece,
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:19.600]   it strengthens the Windows side and it makes it harder
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:20.840]   for them to move forward.
[00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:23.320]   Noble in our chat room has sent me a link to
[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:26.160]   uptime.netcraft.com that confirms that Apple
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:30.480]   is, in fact, running Macs for most of its server.
[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:33.320]   You'll see these are all Apache running on Darwin,
[00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:34.760]   which is, of course, Macintosh.
[00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:37.160]   There are a few Apache running on Unix's here,
[00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:41.600]   appleorder1.apple.com, which sounds like maybe the ecommerce
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:45.560]   consultants.apple.com, gsx.apple.com.
[00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:48.320]   But most of the Apple servers, now iTunes,
[00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:49.520]   is running on Linux.
[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:52.800]   Oddly enough, iTunes.apple.com is running on Linux.
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:53.480]   I wonder whether--
[00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:55.120]   That's a lot of Apple's script, isn't it, isn't it?
[00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:55.640]   iTunes?
[00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:56.200]   I'd send the app.
[00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:56.840]   I don't know what I'm saying.
[00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:57.920]   No, this is the server.
[00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:58.680]   Yeah, the server that I'm--
[00:14:58.680 --> 00:14:59.160]   I know I'm saying it.
[00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:00.080]   --to run the Mac in, obviously.
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:01.720]   Yeah.
[00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:02.360]   And then--
[00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:03.960]   I thought WebObject-- I thought there was a lot of WebObjects
[00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:04.760]   still kind of hanging around.
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:05.440]   There's WebObjects.
[00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:06.280]   You see WebObjects in here.
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:07.360]   The store and stuff like that.
[00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:07.880]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:09.640]   I think they use a lot of WebObjects.
[00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:10.480]   It's interesting.
[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:12.600]   This is actually-- I don't--
[00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:14.320]   Netcraft is a great site for finding out.
[00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:15.360]   It's for all.
[00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:16.560]   You could put it on a site and find out
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:19.040]   what this site is running.
[00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:20.400]   Let's see, Microsoft.com.
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:23.480]   What do you think?
[00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:24.680]   This could be a rat hole.
[00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:26.480]   It's going to be running on its own server.
[00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:28.320]   This could be a hope.
[00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:29.680]   Yeah, I asked there running.
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:31.040]   See, you've got to eat your own dog food.
[00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:32.960]   So Microsoft's all running on its own servers,
[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:33.760]   as you would expect.
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:37.280]   2003, though, not a more recent one.
[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:38.600]   Very interesting.
[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:40.440]   Darwin does not mean it's necessarily--
[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:42.160]   somebody in the chat room is pointing out,
[00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:45.360]   Mac hardware, but I don't understand why Apple,
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:46.880]   which probably gets a deal on Mac hardware,
[00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:47.880]   would bother running it.
[00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:49.880]   I think evidently they know somebody there.
[00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:50.880]   They might make a phone call.
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:52.400]   They might have friends there.
[00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:53.400]   They got a 10% discount.
[00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:55.200]   I'm just thinking, what about this Mac Pro thing?
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.200]   I mean, can we disagree that that's not going to go away?
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:57.720]   I mean, like--
[00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:58.280]   I hope not.
[00:15:58.280 --> 00:15:58.480]   I can't.
[00:15:58.480 --> 00:15:59.440]   Well, I mean, like developers.
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:00.280]   Like, we're builds.
[00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:00.960]   Like, what are you going to do?
[00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:01.720]   You have to.
[00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:02.240]   For me.
[00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:03.600]   Now, the thing is, is that why, you know,
[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:05.160]   when you look at--
[00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:06.640]   I think that eventually developers
[00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:08.240]   are going to be able to develop on the iOS platform.
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:10.400]   And right now, it's very early on.
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:12.600]   And the iOS platform is not ready to do any of that.
[00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:14.160]   But I don't think that that means that it's never going
[00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:15.200]   to be ready to do that.
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:16.120]   I don't think it's going to happen.
[00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:18.080]   So build a cocoa app on an iPhone?
[00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:20.080]   You want to build it on an iPad?
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:21.080]   No, no, no.
[00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:21.840]   Come on.
[00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:23.080]   Now, get real.
[00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:24.320]   No, but I think that's real.
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:26.800]   It's like the iOS one grain at a time.
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:31.560]   But the iOS running on a laptop could be a development
[00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:32.400]   processing.
[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:35.400]   I'm sure the developers-- in fact, Aaron Hillagas,
[00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:38.240]   I think, was saying he was running Xcode on an Air.
[00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:40.000]   I'm sure the developers who will do some of it on Air.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:17:08.280]   You don't want to do the big cocoa hot
[00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:10.280]   and you don't want to do it.
[00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:11.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:12.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:13.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:14.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:15.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:16.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:17.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:18.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:19.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:20.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:21.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:22.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:23.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:24.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:25.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:26.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:27.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:28.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:29.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:30.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:36.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:37.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:38.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:39.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:40.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:41.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:42.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:43.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:44.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:45.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:46.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:47.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:48.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:49.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:50.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:51.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:52.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:53.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:54.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:55.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:56.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:57.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:58.280]   I don't want to do it.

[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:18.280]   I don't want to do it.

[00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:12.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:13.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:14.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:15.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:16.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:17.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:18.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:19.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:20.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:21.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:22.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:23.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:24.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:25.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:26.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:27.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:28.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:29.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:30.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:31.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:32.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:33.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:34.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:35.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:36.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:37.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:38.280]   Sorry.
[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:39.280]   Sorry.
[00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:40.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:41.280]   Sorry.
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:42.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:43.280]   Sorry.
[00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:44.280]   Sorry.
[00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:45.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:46.280]   Sorry.
[00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:47.280]   Sorry.
[00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:48.280]   Sorry.
[00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:49.280]   I don't want to do it.
[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:50.280]   Sorry.
[00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:51.280]   Sorry.
[00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:52.280]   Sorry.
[00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:53.280]   Sorry.
[00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:54.280]   Sorry.
[00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:57.440]   Whatever in Good Reader and downloads it.
[00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:59.340]   Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, say that again?
[00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:00.340]   I think I missed that.
[00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:01.920]   That's in on the iPad.
[00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:03.240]   If you have Good Reader yeah,
[00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:04.540]   on that or iPhone.
[00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:06.420]   But if you have good reader calls.
[00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:08.480]   A bunch of protocols besides HTTP that do stuff.
[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:10.940]   So it's G-H-T-T-P?
[00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:11.780]   That's right.
[00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:12.620]   Wow.
[00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:13.660]   And that will download it into Good Reader,
[00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:14.500]   which I use all the time.
[00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:15.540]   Now get ready for this.
[00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:17.800]   There's a browser built into Good Reader,
[00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:19.120]   which on the first week,
[00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:19.960]   oh, that's kind of cool, whatever.
[00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:20.800]   But if you go in,
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:22.760]   like you ever have an in vacation to do a bunch
[00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:24.220]   of research on one topic,
[00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:25.260]   for it, yeah, I went and learned a lot
[00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:27.080]   about software patterns a few weeks ago.
[00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:28.720]   And I kept finding myself wanting to download
[00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:29.720]   and read all this stuff.
[00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:30.560]   And my Instapaper,
[00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:33.820]   I'd already hit the 200 article limit or whatever.
[00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:37.280]   So I go into a search on Google inside of Good Reader.
[00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:40.100]   And when you're browsing in Good Reader's browser,
[00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:41.120]   every link you click,
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:43.560]   it gives you the option to either follow that link
[00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:45.920]   like you would in a browser or to download it.
[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:48.040]   So you can sit there and do a search in Google.
[00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:49.800]   You follow me, do a search in Google
[00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:51.400]   and click every one of those links
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:53.140]   and it'll download the page
[00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:55.080]   into Good Reader for you to read offline.
[00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:57.280]   Download the whole freaking thing.
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:58.760]   It won't have all the images and stuff
[00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:00.600]   'cause it's not a bit of a basin or anything.
[00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:03.520]   But this is huge for if you wanna just blaze
[00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:05.880]   through a bunch of that stuff really quickly.
[00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:08.080]   - It's kind of your own little Instapaper.
[00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:10.760]   - Good Reader's like your own little like office on the Mac.
[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:11.600]   It's just,
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:14.080]   and I just can do so much air sharing as well.
[00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:14.920]   Great app too.
[00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:16.760]   - The thing that we use it for a lot is that
[00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:18.640]   we don't, every time I do a shoot now,
[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:20.440]   and anywhere, you know, what we make sure is
[00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:21.400]   we have all the manuals
[00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:23.400]   and all the manuals are available on PDF.
[00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:25.460]   Every manual for every piece of equipment
[00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:30.260]   that we have on a shoot, we have in someone's iPad.
[00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:31.780]   You know, and that has become,
[00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:33.380]   and being able to download it directly.
[00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:34.900]   The big problem is we have to plan it.
[00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:37.420]   - I've got a folder in Good Reader called
[00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:39.380]   manuals and documentation.
[00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:40.460]   You can download MP3s.
[00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:42.300]   You can download whatever you want.
[00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:43.580]   And it's right in Good Reader.
[00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:45.420]   And I think air sharing has a lot of this,
[00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:46.780]   but now Good Reader has also added a lot
[00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:49.620]   of PDF markup stuff, sort of along the lines of the--
[00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:52.020]   - Andy, do you want to defend air share?
[00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:52.860]   - They're both great apps.
[00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:53.700]   They're both great apps.
[00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:56.180]   - Yeah, it has a lot of those features.
[00:27:56.180 --> 00:28:00.180]   I believe it also even has that download too.
[00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:04.980]   If you can express a certain file in the form of a URL,
[00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:08.780]   you can hand off the URL directly to air sharing
[00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:09.880]   and download it directly.
[00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:12.660]   I have to, that's one of those features that I use
[00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:14.820]   infrequently enough that I am now in the process
[00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:17.500]   of double checking to make sure you can do that
[00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:20.060]   before I promise you can do that.
[00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:22.220]   But my point is that it really,
[00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:24.780]   it's kind of stinks that there should be a trick
[00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:26.820]   that you have to, a third party app and a trick
[00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:27.940]   in order to get this done.
[00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:30.780]   It should be that just like, it works so well
[00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:32.660]   in so many different apps where you can simply say,
[00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:36.460]   I've got this Word doc file or this PDF file.
[00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:39.500]   I want to keep it or I want to use it with another application,
[00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:41.500]   tap one button and it simply brings up
[00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:44.220]   where the iOS brings up a list automatically populated of.
[00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:46.220]   Here are all the apps that I know of that can deal
[00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:49.340]   with a PDF nicely, which one do you want to send this to?
[00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:50.180]   It's distinct that you-- - You don't get that.
[00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:53.300]   You don't get that in your iPad.
[00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:55.620]   You don't get that option.
[00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:57.540]   - It doesn't have that as a built-in feature.
[00:28:57.540 --> 00:28:59.260]   Again, third party apps like GoodReader
[00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:01.700]   and air sharing will do it,
[00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:03.740]   but it really should be the sort of thing where,
[00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:06.180]   I'm sorry, it should be a feature of the Safari browser
[00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:07.420]   where it knows that here is a,
[00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:09.500]   I recognize this as a link to a file.
[00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:13.140]   I'm not going to simply open it using the built-in reader.
[00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:15.300]   I'm going to treat it like an entity that can then be handed
[00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:19.220]   off either to an email client to a Word processor
[00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:21.340]   or to anything else that knows how to deal with a PDF
[00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:22.340]   or a Word file.
[00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:25.500]   - I'm going to send you a screen grab offline.
[00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:28.660]   (laughing)
[00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:30.340]   - All right, kids, we're going to take a break.
[00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:34.060]   You guys, Merlin's got to go grab his screen or something.
[00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:38.420]   Alex Lindsey is here, Merlin Man, Andy Inaco.
[00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:39.620]   There are some problems apparently
[00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:41.300]   with the MacBook Air, we'll talk about that.
[00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:43.140]   There's lots more to talk about and we'll get back to that
[00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:44.820]   in just a bit, but before we go too much farther,
[00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:46.500]   we want to mention our friends, our good friends
[00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:48.740]   at squarespace.com.
[00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:50.180]   I should let Alex do this commercial
[00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:51.940]   because how many squarespace sites do you have
[00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:52.780]   at this point?
[00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:55.300]   - Well, dbgarage.com is a squarespace,
[00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:56.340]   so it's pixelcore.com.
[00:29:56.340 --> 00:30:00.780]   So is, we are, I'm just doing a new one that,
[00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:03.700]   and it was one of those things that I went to this Ethiopian
[00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:05.540]   restaurant called EAT Moya.
[00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:08.260]   - Moya is brand new in San Francisco
[00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:10.300]   and it's the best Ethiopian I've had in a long time.
[00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:13.980]   And they have a horrible website that was done
[00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:15.220]   in Google sites or something like that,
[00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:16.060]   that just barely works.
[00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:17.340]   And I said, you know what?
[00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:18.740]   Let me play with this a little bit.
[00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:20.060]   And so now I'm putting the whole thing together.
[00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:22.140]   I was like, I can't stay on this or that.
[00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:23.780]   'Cause I have nothing better to do,
[00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:25.700]   really just tooling around.
[00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:28.220]   So anyway, so, but what's great about it is
[00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:29.900]   I can put this whole thing together really quickly.
[00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:31.860]   It's all WYSIWYG, it's not done yet.
[00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:33.420]   - That's kind of the fun thing is you just,
[00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:35.140]   you want to throw a little website for one time,
[00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:36.940]   only just throw it up, go to squarespace
[00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:38.140]   and you got it all there.
[00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:40.260]   - And what's important is that I'm not done with it yet,
[00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:42.060]   I haven't really put it up yet, but once it,
[00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:43.700]   when I'm done, they can edit it.
[00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:45.300]   Like what I don't want is that,
[00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:47.180]   so you can assign them editor capability.
[00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:49.580]   - I'm just going to give it to them and then I'll be able
[00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:50.420]   to, when I'm done with it.
[00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:52.180]   - So you're in the restaurant setting up their website.
[00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:54.100]   - Yeah, just like, you know.
[00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:56.660]   And so the, and we're going to do,
[00:30:56.660 --> 00:30:57.500]   you know, we're going to have fun with it.
[00:30:57.500 --> 00:31:00.300]   Of course, you know what, I'm using it as a test case for us.
[00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:02.620]   So we're going to shoot video for it and stills
[00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:04.220]   and reuse menu and-- - Well, here's the,
[00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:05.060]   here's the beauty part.
[00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:07.820]   You go there right now, squarespace.com/macbreak,
[00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:08.740]   click the try it free button.
[00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:09.740]   I mean, this I'm sure what you did.
[00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:11.580]   You didn't, I mean, it's cost you nothing, you don't even need
[00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:12.420]   a credit card. - I just was like,
[00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:13.260]   I'm just going to go play with it.
[00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:15.300]   - You give them the password, you know, use email address.
[00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:17.020]   And that's it, you've got a site.
[00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:19.540]   If they have an existing site, which sometimes they do,
[00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:22.020]   you can almost always import it directly using their
[00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:25.620]   blog importer, using all the, you know, APIs.
[00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:27.140]   - And they've got, they've got a bunch of templates.
[00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:29.740]   They've got a lot of the tools that, you know,
[00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:32.180]   you can write and you can build and you can download.
[00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:33.460]   But the problem is, is that I don't want to know,
[00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:35.020]   I don't want to know anything about servers.
[00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:36.620]   You know, I don't want to set up servers.
[00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:38.660]   I don't want to, I don't want to port anything to the server.
[00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:40.020]   I don't want to put anything on an FTP site.
[00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:42.940]   I just want to go up, lay something out and hit go.
[00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:44.460]   And that's what Squarespace is so good at.
[00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:45.700]   It's just that you can drag it up.
[00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:46.860]   I don't need to know anything about code.
[00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:49.420]   I mean, I like to do, I'm playing a lot with Xcode now
[00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:51.820]   that we took our class and having fun.
[00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:55.220]   But I don't want to know anything about HTML.
[00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:56.700]   - They also do something, they do something,
[00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:58.580]   first of all, I must say, in interest of disclosure,
[00:31:58.580 --> 00:31:59.540]   they give me a free account.
[00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:02.660]   I am a hyper-dork for Squarespace now.
[00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:03.500]   - Really?
[00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:04.860]   - Oh, I'm so glad to hear that, man.
[00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:06.660]   - I'm considering moving a fairly hyper-fossed
[00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:09.740]   lot of mine to there 'cause I really, really, really like it.
[00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:13.020]   And what I like about it that's cool is they,
[00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:16.620]   you literally can't touch the code,
[00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:18.060]   which on the one hand goes, "Oh, you know,
[00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:18.900]   I won't ever get Drupal.
[00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:20.340]   Like I'm on Drupal, I love Drupal."
[00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:22.700]   But like, you literally can't touch the code.
[00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:24.060]   - It's probably a good thing for me not to touch the code.
[00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:24.900]   - Only thing, yeah.
[00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:28.420]   - Yeah, but I love WordPress, but in WordPress,
[00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:29.740]   if I want to change where the menu is,
[00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:31.260]   I have to go change P and P.
[00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:33.900]   And that makes me crazy at 44.
[00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:36.020]   And so I love WordPress, don't get me wrong.
[00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:38.020]   But you know what I love though, is they've just,
[00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:41.660]   I beat and clasped the crap out of all the HTML.
[00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:43.940]   And so there's all those sites you just saw,
[00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:46.740]   those designs, those are all just pure CSS.
[00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:47.580]   - Yep.
[00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:48.740]   - To my knowledge, I mean--
[00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:49.580]   - Yeah, you're right.
[00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:51.620]   - Yeah, I mean, I think you can probably run some--
[00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:53.260]   - You can do some JavaScript and stuff that you want.
[00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:55.060]   - And you can install some stuff like sliders
[00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:56.260]   and things like that, but--
[00:32:56.260 --> 00:32:57.940]   - Well, as key as you can, if you're a code,
[00:32:57.940 --> 00:33:00.780]   if you're a code reader, you can still go in here
[00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:03.900]   and really tool with the site, tool with what you want to do.
[00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:05.420]   You're not limited to what they have.
[00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:07.820]   - Look at these beautiful, some of these sites are so gorgeous.
[00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:09.060]   People are doing such great stuff.
[00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:10.580]   - It's like, but you know what, Alex, to your point,
[00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:13.100]   I mean, like, and you know, I just, it's like,
[00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:15.660]   I'm so, I love websites, I've been doing this
[00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:18.980]   for a long time, for a job, but it's funny
[00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:21.140]   how I get to a point where like, Tumblr,
[00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:23.340]   I love Tumblr, 'cause you just click a bookmark.
[00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:24.700]   - Right, right, make it easy.
[00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:28.380]   Make it easy, I'm done, I'm over the hand coding stuff.
[00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:30.780]   - Yeah, I use the, I write a lot in Markdown,
[00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:32.620]   but on their site, I actually use the Wizziwig,
[00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:34.220]   I just want to type and hit a button.
[00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:35.460]   And I think there's a lot of people
[00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:36.660]   who want to type and hit a button.
[00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:39.580]   And if you don't, there's ample things out there,
[00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:41.380]   but like if you need something, like if you're ready
[00:33:41.380 --> 00:33:44.220]   to move your blog up or whatever, anyway,
[00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:45.060]   I don't want to go on about it,
[00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:47.660]   but I just slept in very satisfied with them.
[00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:50.660]   - Squarespace.com, if you go to squarespace.com/Macbreak,
[00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:52.140]   you can try it, as we said, for two weeks,
[00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:54.460]   free, easy, no credit card required,
[00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:55.540]   really give you a good sense of it,
[00:33:55.540 --> 00:33:58.020]   and do check out the iPhone app, that's fantastic,
[00:33:58.020 --> 00:34:00.020]   the stats, you know what we found that we really like?
[00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:03.620]   You can use the iPhone app to approve comments,
[00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:05.580]   to block spam, as well as to post,
[00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:06.740]   so it's really handy for--
[00:34:06.740 --> 00:34:07.660]   - Pretty app.
[00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:11.060]   - Yeah, and great for administrating your site.
[00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:14.780]   If you decide to buy, and prices start at $12 a month,
[00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:17.140]   this is by the way, hosting plus software,
[00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:20.700]   10% off for the life of your site if you use the code Macbreak,
[00:34:20.700 --> 00:34:23.820]   it's 10% off forever, if you use the code Macbreak.
[00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:25.220]   - And when you look at those prices,
[00:34:25.220 --> 00:34:26.780]   always remember that you would be paying
[00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:27.820]   for a server somewhere.
[00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:29.180]   - This is server plus software.
[00:34:29.180 --> 00:34:30.020]   - Right, right.
[00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:31.940]   - So the thing is, you're getting all that stuff,
[00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:32.860]   plus all the servers,
[00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:36.780]   and we put up six gigs of information
[00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:39.980]   on for the Ask a Ninja challenge that we did,
[00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:41.860]   and I even emailed them going,
[00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:42.860]   so I just put up a bunch of data,
[00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:44.620]   and I'm gonna talk about it, or are we gonna be okay?
[00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:45.460]   You know, and they were like,
[00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:46.300]   they're amazing.
[00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:47.140]   - They're amazing.
[00:34:47.140 --> 00:34:47.980]   - They're like, they're not.
[00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:48.820]   - They're all gonna receive it.
[00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:50.220]   - You know, you can't bring it down.
[00:34:50.220 --> 00:34:51.380]   - Well, and that's the whole thing.
[00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:53.060]   You know, you colo, or you do something else,
[00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:54.660]   or someone's gonna shut you off,
[00:34:54.660 --> 00:34:58.180]   and you're really gonna get just incredible service.
[00:34:58.180 --> 00:35:00.940]   - And incredible ad, they just got,
[00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:03.620]   like the best ad I've ever heard.
[00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:06.020]   We should just record that and play it over and over again.
[00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:07.700]   Squarespace.com/Macbreak.
[00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:10.380]   Thank you Squarespace for your support, and obviously,
[00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:13.580]   we always try to pick sponsors that we use.
[00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:15.260]   - Right, I use them, and like I said,
[00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:16.380]   they gave me a freebie, but like,
[00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:18.300]   if they can sponsor my whole life as far as I can serve,
[00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:20.620]   I love what they do.
[00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:22.660]   And you know, can I just say also,
[00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:24.220]   every time somebody sends me a freebie code
[00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:25.620]   for an iPhone app or whatever,
[00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:26.940]   like Justin sent me that.
[00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:27.900]   I was like, you know,
[00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:30.140]   I'm just really excited that there's options now.
[00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:32.860]   It wasn't that many years ago that I just didn't have options
[00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:34.020]   for anything I wanted to do.
[00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:35.020]   If you wanted to host a site,
[00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:36.820]   you went to pair and paid $40 a month.
[00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:38.300]   If you wanted to have mobile connectivity,
[00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:39.620]   you went and bought a trio, and like,
[00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:40.660]   you know, that was what you had.
[00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:43.860]   And now it's like, which markdown app
[00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:46.060]   that syncs with Dropbox do I wanna use?
[00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:47.820]   It's like, you know, and with this,
[00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:49.060]   if you wanna go and spend nothing,
[00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:49.940]   and you've got the space,
[00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:52.540]   you can go put something up with,
[00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:53.420]   anyway, not to go on,
[00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:54.740]   but I just, I'm glad there's options.
[00:35:54.740 --> 00:35:56.540]   - Well, it's the sign of the maturity of the industry.
[00:35:56.540 --> 00:35:59.460]   Hey, look what John Gruber just posted on Instagram.
[00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:01.940]   Let me see if I could pull this one up.
[00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:04.300]   - Apple has announced that there won't be a white iPhone
[00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:07.620]   until next year, probably the iPhone 5.
[00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:09.060]   They've finally given up on it.
[00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:11.700]   And yet somehow, he says,
[00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:14.300]   look what a little birdie sent me.
[00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:15.380]   A white iPhone.
[00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:16.220]   - What?
[00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:17.060]   - Show off.
[00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:17.900]   - Show off.
[00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:19.220]   - Show off.
[00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:20.060]   - What?
[00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:20.900]   - What?
[00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:21.740]   - That's just kid.
[00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:22.580]   It's just playing with an iPhone.
[00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:23.940]   - A white iPhone.
[00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:24.780]   - Wow.
[00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:27.740]   - Well, that'd be almost possible to build on your own
[00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:28.820]   or make for efficacy.
[00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:29.660]   - I don't think he faked it.
[00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:30.700]   There are white iPhones.
[00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:32.860]   In fact, everybody at Apple had white iPhones.
[00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:35.380]   - Just forever faking photos.
[00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:36.220]   - Is he?
[00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:37.060]   Is he a big photo faker?
[00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:37.900]   - No.
[00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:38.740]   - Mr. photo faker?
[00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:39.580]   John Gruber.
[00:36:39.580 --> 00:36:40.900]   - I'm just like melanin.
[00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:41.780]   It lacks melanin.
[00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:42.780]   - It lacks melanin.
[00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:45.540]   He got the one that, you know, the albino phone.
[00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:48.820]   - Is he saying it's his or is that just a photo
[00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:49.660]   that someone sent him?
[00:36:49.660 --> 00:36:50.820]   - He said, no, no, that's his kid, right?
[00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:52.740]   So he sent, somebody sent him a white.
[00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:54.380]   But you know, there are white iPhones out there.
[00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:55.900]   Walt Mossberg got a white iPhone.
[00:36:55.900 --> 00:36:57.460]   All the Apple folks have white iPhones.
[00:36:57.460 --> 00:36:59.580]   There's just not a lot of white iPhones.
[00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:00.620]   - Right, there's a handful of them.
[00:37:00.620 --> 00:37:01.980]   Obviously, some of them from Apple said,
[00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:03.420]   oh, I'll send you mine.
[00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:04.780]   I wouldn't be my guess.
[00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:05.980]   I guess I just don't care.
[00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:07.100]   I don't want a white iPhone.
[00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:08.300]   - I think it's a band-aid.
[00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:09.180]   - You should care, Alex.
[00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:10.780]   It's interesting for two important reasons.
[00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:12.980]   I think I could care less about having a white iPhone.
[00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:13.940]   I think they're whatever.
[00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:17.540]   But like, hey, it's real Apple, very seldom.
[00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:18.380]   - That's true.
[00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:20.220]   - That says anything that they can't do.
[00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:21.060]   - That's true, okay.
[00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:23.740]   - And that they can't do it is interesting.
[00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:26.900]   That the manufacturing part of this is so challenging
[00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:29.260]   that they get, obviously, I guess the way you guys described it.
[00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:31.220]   The tech was it because of the tech.
[00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:32.860]   - Sorry, I didn't mean to play that noise.
[00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:34.100]   - The tech was over my head a little bit,
[00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:35.420]   but I guess the way Andy was in that,
[00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:38.500]   your explanation that it was modeled,
[00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:40.180]   like discontinuous colors.
[00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:43.660]   - I didn't, well, I have no specific information
[00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:44.500]   about the iPhone.
[00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:46.700]   I was told by people who are experiencing materials
[00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:49.340]   and engineering that if you have a brand new substance
[00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:50.900]   that you're trying to make something out of,
[00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:52.500]   white is a difficult color to do
[00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:53.980]   because it's easy to do white.
[00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:56.540]   It's hard to do 100,000 copies of something
[00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:58.220]   that are the same shade of white.
[00:37:58.220 --> 00:38:01.140]   It could just as easily be that white showed up scratches
[00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:04.220]   on the glass a lot worse than the black model does,
[00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:05.540]   but this is what's, again,
[00:38:05.540 --> 00:38:09.220]   someone who has been in 18 years with a manufacturing experience
[00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:10.700]   told me that with white,
[00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:13.460]   if you know exactly the kind of material you're working with
[00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:15.860]   and there's a lot of experience working with that material,
[00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:16.700]   it's not a problem.
[00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:19.100]   If it's something that no one has ever used this material
[00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:20.580]   in this application before,
[00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:23.900]   there's gonna be a lot of R&D, white is tricky.
[00:38:23.900 --> 00:38:27.220]   - So, as I was a story, I don't wanna really report on,
[00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:28.540]   but I guess we will.
[00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:30.820]   There are some reported problems with the Logic Board
[00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:33.180]   and the display on MacBook Airs.
[00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:35.540]   - I thought it was the older one though, it's not this one.
[00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:37.980]   - No, the older one had, absolutely had huge problems
[00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:39.100]   with overheating and so forth.
[00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:41.660]   No, this is the 2010 MacBook Air.
[00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:44.460]   This is according to N Gadget,
[00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:46.900]   which says MacBook Air owners reporting Logic Board
[00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:48.540]   and display issues, there's a picture of one.
[00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:51.660]   - Ah, the gray screen with the Colonel Panning
[00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:52.500]   and all of that.
[00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:54.820]   - I really wanna see a visual of a Colonel Panicking.
[00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:57.260]   - What he looks like, I imagine a white mustache.
[00:38:57.260 --> 00:38:58.300]   (laughing)
[00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:00.300]   - He's the monopoly, you're saying he's the monopoly guy.
[00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:02.380]   - I say, I say Colonel Panning,
[00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:06.860]   Colonel Conservatory with the unreferenced
[00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:08.940]   and unallocated memories.
[00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:11.100]   - All I can say is I haven't had a problem with mine
[00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:12.420]   and I don't know anybody who has,
[00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:13.780]   so when you get a new product,
[00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:14.860]   always there are problems, right?
[00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:17.660]   - I can say that I've had with Colonel Panning with this
[00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:19.220]   and one or two instances
[00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:21.660]   and what you would not for some reason wake up from sleep.
[00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:23.260]   - That's when this always happens apparently,
[00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:24.180]   is when you wake up.
[00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:25.340]   - Yeah.
[00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:27.620]   - So you have had problems, I haven't had a one.
[00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:30.220]   - Well, I'm not sure if I call it problems plural,
[00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:33.020]   it's not, it wouldn't, it's the sort of thing
[00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:35.020]   that only racks into focus for me
[00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:36.260]   when I realize that other people
[00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:37.980]   are having this problem too.
[00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:38.900]   - Yeah.
[00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:40.060]   - You know, I have a lot of Colonel Panics
[00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:41.140]   when I wake up as well.
[00:39:41.140 --> 00:39:42.460]   (laughing)
[00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:43.860]   - And it's really, it's a common problem for me.
[00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:44.900]   - It's like night terrors.
[00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:45.740]   - Yeah, yeah, I mean it's--
[00:39:45.740 --> 00:39:47.380]   - Web 008 says Colonel Panick
[00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:49.140]   with a white iPhone in the kitchen.
[00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:51.020]   (laughing)
[00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:52.860]   - So what do you guys think of this story
[00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:57.380]   about Adobe Flash killing the battery on the MacBook Air?
[00:39:57.380 --> 00:40:01.660]   Daniel, Aaron Dilger writing an Apple insider says
[00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:04.660]   by two hours, I mean you only get five hours total.
[00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:06.860]   - I'm not buying that big deal.
[00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:07.740]   - Well, it's not even a big deal.
[00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:09.900]   I think that what, okay, if you turn on,
[00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:10.740]   if you go to a site--
[00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:12.540]   - Actually it's ours technique, Chris Foreman writing
[00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:13.380]   an ours technique.
[00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:14.700]   - If you go to a site and you let it run
[00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:16.860]   over and over and over again with, you know,
[00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:19.980]   animated Flash things on a website, yeah, it's gonna--
[00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:20.820]   - Let it, let it run.
[00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:21.660]   - If you played a movie.
[00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:22.660]   (laughing)
[00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:23.500]   - I mean it's gonna--
[00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:25.260]   - No, but I'm saying it, I think what he did though
[00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:27.340]   is he went to a site that's got a bunch of Flash on it
[00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:28.700]   and then he let it run for the whole time.
[00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:29.540]   And of course it's gonna shorten it,
[00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:30.660]   but if you played a bunch of movies there,
[00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:31.660]   I would shorten it as well.
[00:40:31.660 --> 00:40:33.300]   I mean, there's a lot of things about Flash
[00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:35.140]   that I don't like, I just don't, I'm not buying this.
[00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:36.300]   - Well, wait a minute, I was playing,
[00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:37.700]   well I see I was playing MP,
[00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:40.940]   one of my stress tests was to play MP4
[00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:43.340]   at full like DVD resolution full screen
[00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:44.580]   for as long as it would go.
[00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:46.540]   And that knocked about an hour to hour and a half
[00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:49.340]   off the five hour battery life, I'm not sure that they've
[00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:52.540]   demonstrated yet that it's doing an unusual amount
[00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:55.420]   of battery drain as opposed to just any application
[00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:58.620]   that uses the CPU a lot and by nature keeps the screen
[00:40:58.620 --> 00:40:59.460]   a lot--
[00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:01.980]   - And his point is that these web pages had Flash ads
[00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:04.020]   and that if you don't have Flash installed,
[00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:06.140]   you won't get the Flash ads, you get a static ads.
[00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:09.500]   So Apple doesn't install Flash with the MacBook Air.
[00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:10.900]   I guess what--
[00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:12.460]   - Or any of the new computers.
[00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:13.620]   - Or any of the new ones, huh?
[00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:14.460]   - That's interesting.
[00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:15.300]   - They're turning it off for all of them.
[00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:19.340]   - Yeah, I think this is a bigger thing than just battery life.
[00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:21.860]   - I think it by the way could also be,
[00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:24.220]   and Steve Gibson in our security program brought this up,
[00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:27.540]   the fact that if you put Flash in a build,
[00:41:27.540 --> 00:41:29.380]   you may well have an old version
[00:41:29.380 --> 00:41:31.540]   and since Flash has had a lot of security issues,
[00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:34.140]   as an insecure version of Flash on your build,
[00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:36.020]   wouldn't it be far better to just say,
[00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:37.780]   download the latest version of the plugin?
[00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:38.980]   Of course they put quick time on there.
[00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:41.660]   - Well I think one of the issues is that if you are a minor,
[00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:44.660]   if you have a small percentage of an industry,
[00:41:44.660 --> 00:41:48.580]   you can do a lot of things that are legal under antitrust.
[00:41:48.580 --> 00:41:52.500]   If you become a majority stakeholder in a computing device,
[00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:54.940]   so if people start making the argument
[00:41:54.940 --> 00:41:57.780]   that it's not just laptops, it's computing devices
[00:41:57.780 --> 00:42:00.900]   and they include iPhones and iPads and computers,
[00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:04.900]   and they start seeing that Apple has 50, 60, 70% of the market,
[00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:05.980]   they can no longer do these things.
[00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:08.980]   You had to have done them before that happened.
[00:42:08.980 --> 00:42:10.580]   So I think that if Apple's gonna do anything
[00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:12.780]   that's going to go, to do things that are monopolistic--
[00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:13.620]   - They don't have to worry.
[00:42:13.620 --> 00:42:15.820]   - They're never gonna have a significant percentage
[00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:16.980]   of the PC market.
[00:42:16.980 --> 00:42:19.900]   - But if I was a lawyer, I would define it
[00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:21.340]   as personal computing device.
[00:42:21.340 --> 00:42:22.340]   I would not define it as--
[00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:23.900]   - Well, but I think any judge would say no,
[00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:26.580]   there's a big difference between an iPhone and iPad.
[00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:28.900]   - If the iOS runs across everything, maybe not.
[00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:31.420]   - But this isn't yet iOS, so they're safe now.
[00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:34.060]   - No, I'm saying, there's no case right now.
[00:42:34.060 --> 00:42:34.900]   - You're saying down the road.
[00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:36.820]   - What I'm saying is is that if I was a lawyer talking,
[00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:38.260]   and you're looking at the trajectory
[00:42:38.260 --> 00:42:40.380]   of what you're doing and how successful you are,
[00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:42.100]   if you're gonna do anything that is,
[00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:44.740]   "Apple can do this," that Microsoft couldn't.
[00:42:44.740 --> 00:42:46.900]   If Microsoft stopped installing Flash,
[00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:49.620]   they would be in court tomorrow.
[00:42:49.620 --> 00:42:53.260]   - Adobe's CTO Kevin Lynch says, "It's a false argument
[00:42:53.260 --> 00:42:53.860]   to make when you're--"
[00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:55.260]   This actually echoes you, Alex.
[00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:57.580]   "When you're using a rather displaying content,
[00:42:57.580 --> 00:43:00.500]   any technology will use more power to display
[00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:01.940]   versus not displaying content."
[00:43:01.940 --> 00:43:04.060]   If you use HTML5, for example,
[00:43:04.060 --> 00:43:07.460]   to display ads that would use as much or--
[00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:09.460]   All right, this is his contention, not mine--
[00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:13.060]   as much or more processing power than what Flash uses.
[00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:13.900]   I don't know if that's the case.
[00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:15.260]   - I don't know if it's more, but I definitely think--
[00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:17.020]   'cause there's some chipsets that actually
[00:43:17.020 --> 00:43:19.620]   in the iPhone and iPad that are optimized--
[00:43:19.620 --> 00:43:23.700]   - And it's just four or five, but in the H264, but not Flash.
[00:43:23.700 --> 00:43:24.540]   - Right.
[00:43:24.540 --> 00:43:26.260]   - In fact, I don't know if this is true,
[00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:28.500]   but I think I read on ours that one of the advantages
[00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:30.940]   Apple has by making its own processor
[00:43:30.940 --> 00:43:32.940]   is they can leave out the code, the microcode,
[00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:34.700]   that might support something like Flash,
[00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:36.460]   optimize for what they do use.
[00:43:36.460 --> 00:43:37.300]   - Right.
[00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:40.140]   - And it will be that Flash hits a MacBook Air harder.
[00:43:40.140 --> 00:43:40.980]   Who not?
[00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:41.820]   Well, not an Air, but--
[00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:42.820]   - Well, they're not optimizing for it.
[00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:43.980]   - The Air is just a core too.
[00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:45.100]   - When we're seeing it, we saw Adobe,
[00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:46.340]   I think it was last week of the week before,
[00:43:46.340 --> 00:43:47.980]   they're announcing that they are,
[00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:49.980]   there's a lot more support coming for
[00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:53.100]   being able to author in Flash and export to HTML5.
[00:43:53.100 --> 00:43:54.500]   I mean, I think they're starting to--
[00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:55.420]   - Yeah, they're doing it too.
[00:43:55.420 --> 00:43:57.780]   - You're gonna hear your fan getting hit pretty hard
[00:43:57.780 --> 00:43:58.780]   when you do that.
[00:43:58.780 --> 00:44:00.260]   (laughs)
[00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:02.500]   - You're using Flash to create Flash, is that the idea?
[00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:04.020]   - No, HTML5.
[00:44:04.020 --> 00:44:06.140]   Flash is a translator.
[00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:07.300]   - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:44:07.300 --> 00:44:09.900]   The thing that makes it the moves Flash over to HTML5.
[00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:12.460]   - Yeah, Adobe, Lynch also says, quote,
[00:44:12.460 --> 00:44:15.380]   "The Apple is inciting and condoning attacks on Flash."
[00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:16.980]   We don't think it's good for the web
[00:44:16.980 --> 00:44:18.580]   to have aspects closed off,
[00:44:18.580 --> 00:44:19.860]   a blockade of certain types of expression.
[00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:21.660]   - Thank gosh, finally, finally Adobe,
[00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:23.180]   I'm so glad that they're getting out there
[00:44:23.180 --> 00:44:24.420]   and talking about openness.
[00:44:24.420 --> 00:44:25.900]   (laughs)
[00:44:25.900 --> 00:44:28.140]   It's really, it's high time that they really take
[00:44:28.140 --> 00:44:29.380]   the world to task.
[00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:30.860]   - Oh, the other side.
[00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:33.460]   - There's a decade of content out there
[00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:35.740]   that you just can't view on Apple's device.
[00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:39.180]   And I think it's not only hurtful to Adobe,
[00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:40.780]   but hurtful to me personally.
[00:44:40.780 --> 00:44:43.620]   No, hurtful to everyone that created that content.
[00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:44.980]   - And I think that Adobe is--
[00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:46.780]   (laughs)
[00:44:46.780 --> 00:44:49.220]   - I think we all got a report that I could cast things.
[00:44:49.220 --> 00:44:51.220]   Twilight moved, and we listened to it.
[00:44:51.220 --> 00:44:52.740]   (laughs)
[00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:53.820]   - I want that job.
[00:44:53.820 --> 00:44:55.420]   Well, I really think it is important for Adobe
[00:44:55.420 --> 00:44:56.260]   to move towards,
[00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:58.740]   they have a lot of incredibly talented designers
[00:44:58.740 --> 00:45:02.180]   and they have a lot of incredibly interesting technologies
[00:45:02.180 --> 00:45:03.020]   that they have there.
[00:45:03.020 --> 00:45:05.180]   And if they can stay ahead of this
[00:45:05.180 --> 00:45:07.260]   and move those authoring technologies
[00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:09.580]   and move those artists into an HTML5 environment,
[00:45:09.580 --> 00:45:11.260]   I think they're gonna be,
[00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:12.700]   they're gonna have a good aspect,
[00:45:12.700 --> 00:45:13.860]   but if they hang on to Flash too long,
[00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:14.940]   I think they're gonna have trouble.
[00:45:14.940 --> 00:45:17.900]   - One more sub story from T-Mobile.
[00:45:17.900 --> 00:45:22.900]   T-Mobile said the reason that we had such a bad quarter
[00:45:22.900 --> 00:45:24.740]   is because-- - Oh boy.
[00:45:24.740 --> 00:45:25.580]   (laughs)
[00:45:25.580 --> 00:45:27.380]   - It's because we don't have the iPhone.
[00:45:27.380 --> 00:45:30.300]   - Wait, wait, no, the dog ate my lunch.
[00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:34.540]   - Yeah, no, if we had the iPhone.
[00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:35.700]   - Yeah.
[00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:38.140]   - Germany's Deutsche Telekom AG reported profits
[00:45:38.140 --> 00:45:40.420]   that beat expectations but blamed poor performance
[00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:42.940]   on its American T-Mobile subsidiary
[00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:45.940]   on the inability to sell the iPhone.
[00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:49.820]   The US used to be a cash cow for Deutsche Telekom,
[00:45:49.820 --> 00:45:53.180]   but it has to be, (laughs)
[00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:55.460]   and since 2008--
[00:45:55.460 --> 00:45:57.180]   - Leo, don't provoke the German.
[00:45:57.180 --> 00:45:58.180]   (laughs)
[00:45:58.180 --> 00:45:59.780]   - We've all seen how that ended.
[00:45:59.780 --> 00:46:02.260]   - Rene, or--
[00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:07.020]   - I'd like to announce that my own mobile broadband company
[00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:08.780]   is doing extremely well.
[00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:11.220]   It's only limited profit-wise by the fact
[00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:13.940]   that we don't sell iPhones and Android devices
[00:46:13.940 --> 00:46:15.260]   with those mobile devices.
[00:46:15.260 --> 00:46:18.020]   Or any popular handsets of any kind,
[00:46:18.020 --> 00:46:21.460]   and we're limited to basically any third party unit
[00:46:21.460 --> 00:46:23.460]   and phones I happen to have in the garage.
[00:46:23.460 --> 00:46:24.580]   Other than that, we're great.
[00:46:24.580 --> 00:46:25.940]   We're just solid.
[00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:27.380]   - It's the iPhones fault.
[00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:29.500]   Gonnae Olbermann, not related to Keith Olbermann,
[00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:31.180]   said T-Mobile's churn rate in the US
[00:46:31.180 --> 00:46:32.580]   is being driven by the iPhone.
[00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:34.620]   They have a very high churn rate.
[00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:37.260]   He says, "Consumers like T-Mobile,
[00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:39.740]   but they also want to have the iPhone."
[00:46:39.740 --> 00:46:43.620]   Which we have no chance of getting
[00:46:43.620 --> 00:46:45.420]   in this short term, but that's interesting
[00:46:45.420 --> 00:46:47.540]   because there were rumors that maybe T-Mobile
[00:46:47.540 --> 00:46:48.380]   would have that iPhone.
[00:46:48.380 --> 00:46:49.540]   - There's no GSM phone, right?
[00:46:49.540 --> 00:46:51.180]   - You're kind of like, why would Apple
[00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:52.580]   go through the trouble of T-Mobile?
[00:46:52.580 --> 00:46:54.620]   That's the issue is that it doesn't provide anything
[00:46:54.620 --> 00:46:56.820]   that is significantly better than what they're getting
[00:46:56.820 --> 00:46:57.820]   from AT&T.
[00:46:57.820 --> 00:47:00.500]   I mean, the only one you really want is Verizon.
[00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:02.260]   I know a lot of people that are waiting.
[00:47:02.260 --> 00:47:04.180]   Like they're all just sitting there watching the wait.
[00:47:04.180 --> 00:47:05.020]   I mean, there's some--
[00:47:05.020 --> 00:47:05.860]   - Is that officially happening?
[00:47:05.860 --> 00:47:06.860]   Is that officially officially happening?
[00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:08.620]   - Not official, but the Wall Street Journal,
[00:47:08.620 --> 00:47:11.700]   which has been the house organ of Apple for some time now,
[00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:13.780]   says so, so I believe it.
[00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:17.300]   - Yeah, it's the, I just, almost everybody I know
[00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:19.380]   that doesn't have an iPhone has Verizon.
[00:47:19.380 --> 00:47:20.220]   - It's waiting for a Verizon.
[00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:21.900]   - And they're just waiting to get an iPhone when Verizon--
[00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:23.860]   - You know, it was kind of a big disappointment with it.
[00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:26.220]   And I think Microsoft probably feels the same
[00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:30.140]   when the Windows mobile phone comes out on AT&T.
[00:47:30.140 --> 00:47:32.060]   It's like head to head with, yeah.
[00:47:32.060 --> 00:47:36.060]   - And I cannot yet report, and certainly not
[00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:38.500]   no scientific reporting on whether this is,
[00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:42.180]   has less problems with the AT&T network than the iPhone does,
[00:47:42.180 --> 00:47:45.740]   or I should say fewer problems, but it seems to be
[00:47:45.740 --> 00:47:48.340]   about the same, to be honest, which is not great.
[00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:53.180]   Dropped calls, crappy audio, few bars, all of that stuff.
[00:47:53.180 --> 00:47:55.060]   - I'm in a bad AT&T area.
[00:47:55.060 --> 00:47:56.620]   It's called California.
[00:47:56.620 --> 00:47:58.620]   - California, California, yeah.
[00:47:58.620 --> 00:48:01.220]   - It's called the United States. - United States of America.
[00:48:01.220 --> 00:48:04.260]   Let's take a break and we're gonna talk more.
[00:48:04.260 --> 00:48:07.460]   We've got your picks coming up in just a little bit too.
[00:48:07.460 --> 00:48:09.740]   Andy, we do, do we have an Audible today?
[00:48:09.740 --> 00:48:12.700]   I don't think we do, so hold your Audible powder.
[00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:14.980]   - I'm holding my Audible powder.
[00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:17.900]   - I do hold that Audible.
[00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:18.940]   - I'm hoping you can't see it,
[00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:20.740]   and then holding it on the camera, 'cause otherwise--
[00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:23.500]   - Keep it out of range. - Save that pick.
[00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:25.380]   I do wanna, I do wanna talk a little bit about our friends
[00:48:25.380 --> 00:48:27.660]   at Citrix who make a great product called GoToMyPC,
[00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:29.500]   and they really are at great pains to let you know
[00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:31.260]   that it works on Macs.
[00:48:31.260 --> 00:48:33.700]   In fact, you could try it free right now for 30 days
[00:48:33.700 --> 00:48:37.100]   on your Mac if you go to go to mypc.com,
[00:48:37.100 --> 00:48:38.500]   use the offer code Mac, break.
[00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:40.500]   You can also try it free on Windows.
[00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:41.260]   It works on both.
[00:48:41.260 --> 00:48:43.540]   In fact, it's a great way to go across platform.
[00:48:43.540 --> 00:48:45.060]   I do know people who go to coffee shops,
[00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:46.900]   you know, we're hearing about this fire sheep,
[00:48:46.900 --> 00:48:50.260]   this Firefox plugin that lets people steal your login
[00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:53.180]   to Twitter and Facebook and Google and other places,
[00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:54.180]   WordPress.
[00:48:54.180 --> 00:48:56.340]   What a great solution.
[00:48:56.340 --> 00:48:58.620]   Use GoToMyPC, go to that coffee shop,
[00:48:58.620 --> 00:49:00.020]   log into your office computer,
[00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:04.180]   surf from there, you're 128-bit SSL, absolutely protected.
[00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:06.540]   It's just one of many ways people are using GoToMyPC.
[00:49:06.540 --> 00:49:08.820]   It's the ideal remote access solution.
[00:49:08.820 --> 00:49:11.180]   The holidays are coming, you wanna go home early,
[00:49:11.180 --> 00:49:12.580]   wanna be there for the turkey,
[00:49:12.580 --> 00:49:14.900]   but you don't wanna come back to a full mailbox,
[00:49:14.900 --> 00:49:16.980]   go to mypc.com.
[00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:19.300]   If you visit GoToMyPC.com/Macbreak,
[00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:22.180]   you can try it free for 30 days, remote access, done easy.
[00:49:22.180 --> 00:49:25.300]   In fact, so easy that if you try,
[00:49:25.300 --> 00:49:26.940]   if you go there right now before I'm done talking,
[00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:29.740]   you will have that installed, it just takes a few seconds.
[00:49:29.740 --> 00:49:31.660]   Then you go out on the row with your laptop,
[00:49:31.660 --> 00:49:34.340]   you don't have to have it on the laptop at all.
[00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:36.540]   You know, I go to coffee shop with my MacBook Air,
[00:49:36.540 --> 00:49:39.100]   I log on to GoToMyPC with my credentials,
[00:49:39.100 --> 00:49:40.780]   30 seconds later I'm on my office computer.
[00:49:40.780 --> 00:49:41.940]   - You're having access to, you know,
[00:49:41.940 --> 00:49:44.620]   being able to get to your computer from afar
[00:49:44.620 --> 00:49:47.060]   has really changed the way that I, you know, what I carry.
[00:49:47.060 --> 00:49:48.260]   You know, and because now, like,
[00:49:48.260 --> 00:49:49.580]   how much data I carry because I know how I know
[00:49:49.580 --> 00:49:50.420]   how I know how to-- - It's kind of cloud.
[00:49:50.420 --> 00:49:51.260]   Computing, isn't it?
[00:49:51.260 --> 00:49:53.100]   Because, but your cloud is your computer
[00:49:53.100 --> 00:49:54.580]   at all, or the office is your personal cloud?
[00:49:54.580 --> 00:49:56.940]   - I mean, 'cause a lot of times I have way too much data.
[00:49:56.940 --> 00:49:58.780]   I can't put it all on the cloud.
[00:49:58.780 --> 00:49:59.780]   - Right. - I put a lot of it
[00:49:59.780 --> 00:50:01.340]   on the cloud, but I can't put it all on the cloud.
[00:50:01.340 --> 00:50:02.980]   And so, but I-- - Well, and there's also,
[00:50:02.980 --> 00:50:04.580]   you can run programs, you can send them
[00:50:04.580 --> 00:50:06.420]   to receive your corporate email, for instance.
[00:50:06.420 --> 00:50:07.340]   - Yeah. - None of us work
[00:50:07.340 --> 00:50:10.700]   in big corporations, but that's a real boon.
[00:50:10.700 --> 00:50:14.060]   Especially if you send an email to the boss.
[00:50:14.060 --> 00:50:16.340]   I would recommend like three in the morning
[00:50:16.340 --> 00:50:19.340]   from your corporate email saying,
[00:50:19.340 --> 00:50:21.580]   "Work a little late, but I'll be in in the morning
[00:50:21.580 --> 00:50:23.580]   "seven a.m. as always."
[00:50:23.580 --> 00:50:25.700]   It fools them every time, 'cause bosses don't understand.
[00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:26.540]   Go to my PC.
[00:50:26.540 --> 00:50:27.620]   Go to me.
[00:50:27.620 --> 00:50:28.980]   Unless you're the boss and you do understand.
[00:50:28.980 --> 00:50:31.380]   Go to my PC.com/MacBreak.
[00:50:31.380 --> 00:50:33.100]   It is a really great product, give it a try.
[00:50:33.100 --> 00:50:34.780]   We know you will like it.
[00:50:34.780 --> 00:50:36.540]   We thank Citrix, they've been a great supporter
[00:50:36.540 --> 00:50:39.620]   of the Twit Network for, I think we're on our third
[00:50:39.620 --> 00:50:41.140]   or fourth year with them.
[00:50:41.140 --> 00:50:42.140]   Just wonderful.
[00:50:42.140 --> 00:50:46.620]   - Moving along, Mac App Prices.
[00:50:46.620 --> 00:50:48.460]   Now, I don't know if you can trust this or not.
[00:50:48.460 --> 00:50:51.860]   Somebody blew up the ad,
[00:50:51.860 --> 00:50:55.740]   or the presentation for Mac Apps.
[00:50:55.740 --> 00:50:57.020]   What is this from?
[00:50:57.020 --> 00:50:59.540]   Yes, the Apple's promo image for the Mac App Store
[00:50:59.540 --> 00:51:01.380]   and looked at prices.
[00:51:01.380 --> 00:51:03.220]   And if you look really carefully,
[00:51:03.220 --> 00:51:07.660]   you'll see that the iLife Apps are 15 bucks each.
[00:51:07.660 --> 00:51:09.820]   The iWork Apps, 20 bucks each.
[00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:12.500]   That's pretty much the same price
[00:51:12.500 --> 00:51:16.140]   as they are in the regular store.
[00:51:16.140 --> 00:51:18.860]   If you buy them online or if you buy them in a store.
[00:51:18.860 --> 00:51:20.020]   - Right.
[00:51:20.020 --> 00:51:22.340]   - So, but you know, it's funny.
[00:51:22.340 --> 00:51:25.660]   $15 doesn't feel as bad as $49.
[00:51:25.660 --> 00:51:27.700]   - You may decide you're not gonna use a lot of those.
[00:51:27.700 --> 00:51:29.460]   For instance, you might wanna use pages,
[00:51:29.460 --> 00:51:30.620]   but you don't wanna use numbers.
[00:51:30.620 --> 00:51:32.300]   - Do you think that, and by the way,
[00:51:32.300 --> 00:51:35.340]   in this promo copy, they do have a free dice game roll 'em?
[00:51:35.340 --> 00:51:37.300]   So it's important that they're kind of emphasizing,
[00:51:37.300 --> 00:51:39.700]   yes, there will be free stuff in here.
[00:51:39.700 --> 00:51:41.700]   They've got a $5 game there for it
[00:51:41.700 --> 00:51:43.780]   and then called Fastlane.
[00:51:43.780 --> 00:51:45.300]   Color Studio, $30.
[00:51:45.300 --> 00:51:48.020]   So there, I think there's some thought that went into this.
[00:51:48.020 --> 00:51:49.500]   I think it's reasonable to look at this and say,
[00:51:49.500 --> 00:51:51.540]   yeah, this is kind of what Apple is gonna be.
[00:51:51.540 --> 00:51:52.700]   - They're setting the pace.
[00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:54.340]   - Push in, yeah.
[00:51:54.340 --> 00:51:56.460]   - Does that sound right for an App Store?
[00:51:56.460 --> 00:51:57.660]   - Well, I mean, I think that they're saying,
[00:51:57.660 --> 00:52:00.380]   if you're in a general market and you have a basic use item,
[00:52:00.380 --> 00:52:03.580]   this is the price that Apple's going to try to set the pace
[00:52:03.580 --> 00:52:06.180]   with, I think that there are iPhone apps that are a lot
[00:52:06.180 --> 00:52:08.060]   more expensive than the $3 or $4.
[00:52:08.060 --> 00:52:08.900]   - That's true now.
[00:52:08.900 --> 00:52:13.020]   - If you're in a vertical market, there are applications.
[00:52:13.020 --> 00:52:15.020]   I bought TomTom for my iPhone, it's a $99.
[00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:16.580]   - That's right, I'm very happy with it.
[00:52:16.580 --> 00:52:18.060]   - Oh yeah, yeah, I love it.
[00:52:18.060 --> 00:52:21.940]   So it doesn't mean that you can't charge more
[00:52:21.940 --> 00:52:24.140]   in a vertical market, but it will make it harder
[00:52:24.140 --> 00:52:26.660]   if you're making a general application to sell it
[00:52:26.660 --> 00:52:27.980]   for more than $20, I think.
[00:52:27.980 --> 00:52:30.300]   Because the people are gonna compare you to those things.
[00:52:30.300 --> 00:52:32.420]   - They are accepting apps now for the, in fact,
[00:52:32.420 --> 00:52:34.580]   they're begging developers to send apps out
[00:52:34.580 --> 00:52:36.940]   for the App Store.
[00:52:36.940 --> 00:52:40.380]   How soon, Andy, do you have any thoughts on how soon
[00:52:40.380 --> 00:52:41.220]   we'll see the App Store?
[00:52:41.220 --> 00:52:44.500]   They said three months, about three weeks ago.
[00:52:44.500 --> 00:52:46.460]   - I don't think we'll see it by the end of the year.
[00:52:46.460 --> 00:52:48.020]   I think the January.
[00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:50.820]   - Right now, we're sorted in that part.
[00:52:50.820 --> 00:52:52.420]   We're kind of in the part of the year right now,
[00:52:52.420 --> 00:52:55.740]   where we start trying to figure out what Apple
[00:52:55.740 --> 00:52:58.620]   is gonna be talking about in late January.
[00:52:58.620 --> 00:53:00.820]   And there are at least two or three things
[00:53:00.820 --> 00:53:02.340]   that are kind of on that dock.
[00:53:02.340 --> 00:53:05.020]   And one of them is to announce the opening
[00:53:05.020 --> 00:53:06.220]   on the Mac App Store.
[00:53:06.220 --> 00:53:08.820]   Another one is going to be, here's what the iPad 2
[00:53:08.820 --> 00:53:10.260]   is gonna look like.
[00:53:10.260 --> 00:53:12.300]   One is white iPhone, finally.
[00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:16.020]   And then there's an opportunity to show off the first
[00:53:16.020 --> 00:53:19.900]   non-canned demo of what the line's gonna look like.
[00:53:19.900 --> 00:53:20.900]   - Right.
[00:53:20.900 --> 00:53:24.340]   - So I'm not encouraged to think that they're gonna
[00:53:24.340 --> 00:53:28.100]   try to get it ready before the end of the holidays.
[00:53:28.100 --> 00:53:31.020]   It'd be great if for Mac developers,
[00:53:31.020 --> 00:53:33.420]   every time you, all these people are getting the $50
[00:53:33.420 --> 00:53:35.700]   iTunes gift cards, and have the opportunity
[00:53:35.700 --> 00:53:39.660]   to buy their 10 dollar game, in addition to the usual $30
[00:53:39.660 --> 00:53:42.740]   with the music and 15 hours worth of iPhone games as well.
[00:53:42.740 --> 00:53:43.820]   But I don't think they're gonna make that.
[00:53:43.820 --> 00:53:45.500]   I think it's gonna be January.
[00:53:45.500 --> 00:53:48.140]   - Yeah, what I think is kind of interesting is that
[00:53:48.140 --> 00:53:51.580]   the Mac developers are getting actually a lot more warning
[00:53:51.580 --> 00:53:52.420]   than they normally get.
[00:53:52.420 --> 00:53:55.220]   I mean, normally you get to see this at WWDC.
[00:53:55.220 --> 00:53:58.260]   And I find that it is interesting, as you look at this,
[00:53:58.260 --> 00:54:00.620]   that now we're not seeing it just happening in June,
[00:54:00.620 --> 00:54:01.740]   and they're getting a lot of warning.
[00:54:01.740 --> 00:54:02.660]   We're giving you a preview.
[00:54:02.660 --> 00:54:03.780]   We're letting you do these App Stores.
[00:54:03.780 --> 00:54:05.060]   We're gonna let you build up.
[00:54:05.060 --> 00:54:06.420]   And then we're going to probably talk,
[00:54:06.420 --> 00:54:08.620]   that's why I think we're gonna see even more
[00:54:08.620 --> 00:54:13.620]   as we get to WWDC, we're gonna see even more changes
[00:54:14.020 --> 00:54:17.380]   to what's available on the Mac platform.
[00:54:17.380 --> 00:54:22.180]   - Sorry about that.
[00:54:22.180 --> 00:54:23.420]   I'm just trying to get Merlin back on here.
[00:54:23.420 --> 00:54:25.020]   He seems to have dropped off.
[00:54:25.020 --> 00:54:26.260]   - Yeah.
[00:54:26.260 --> 00:54:27.100]   - Moving on.
[00:54:27.100 --> 00:54:28.500]   - That was kind of a little bit disappointed,
[00:54:28.500 --> 00:54:33.020]   because the Mac Tech Conference was both for IT and developers.
[00:54:33.020 --> 00:54:35.380]   And so I was looking forward to putting up those questions
[00:54:35.380 --> 00:54:37.220]   to as many different developers as possible.
[00:54:37.220 --> 00:54:40.620]   I really can't find anybody who is scared of the App Store
[00:54:40.620 --> 00:54:41.460]   at the point.
[00:54:41.460 --> 00:54:43.260]   Everybody seems to think that it's gonna be good for users.
[00:54:43.260 --> 00:54:45.020]   It's gonna be good for developers.
[00:54:45.020 --> 00:54:48.300]   And if you feel as though you're in a developer business
[00:54:48.300 --> 00:54:51.860]   that the App Store can't possibly help you,
[00:54:51.860 --> 00:54:54.180]   it will leave your business unchanged.
[00:54:54.180 --> 00:54:57.700]   If you really are a direct to the consumer sort of business,
[00:54:57.700 --> 00:55:02.620]   where you really wanna sell the app that Apple's never gonna prove,
[00:55:02.620 --> 00:55:05.180]   at least those people seem to be convinced and confident
[00:55:05.180 --> 00:55:08.180]   that their business is not gonna be ruined or affected in any way
[00:55:08.180 --> 00:55:11.220]   by the fact that their $400 image editing app
[00:55:11.220 --> 00:55:12.820]   is not gonna be inside the App Store.
[00:55:12.820 --> 00:55:14.500]   - Well, I think in the short term, I think they're right.
[00:55:14.500 --> 00:55:17.740]   I just feel like they're, you know, I just, there's no way.
[00:55:17.740 --> 00:55:19.140]   I mean, when you look at five years from now,
[00:55:19.140 --> 00:55:20.780]   I just think that there's not gonna be any way.
[00:55:20.780 --> 00:55:22.060]   - Oh, we've had this conversation.
[00:55:22.060 --> 00:55:24.020]   I just gotta bow out 'cause you know me,
[00:55:24.020 --> 00:55:26.620]   I'm Mr. Rick Loom and Doom chicken little.
[00:55:26.620 --> 00:55:29.660]   But I, you know, I think the truth is I will like the App Store.
[00:55:29.660 --> 00:55:31.780]   That's kind of what concerns me.
[00:55:31.780 --> 00:55:34.140]   It's that it's gonna be very appealing.
[00:55:34.140 --> 00:55:34.980]   So appealing.
[00:55:34.980 --> 00:55:36.620]   I can see everybody saying, oh, we don't need anything.
[00:55:36.620 --> 00:55:38.140]   - Here's the thing, here's a good example.
[00:55:38.140 --> 00:55:41.780]   I mean, I think that, I mean, I love my, you know,
[00:55:41.780 --> 00:55:43.660]   my Adobe Creative Suite.
[00:55:43.660 --> 00:55:45.660]   But I don't have Acrobat running, Acrobat Pro running on it,
[00:55:45.660 --> 00:55:46.700]   even though I bought it with it.
[00:55:46.700 --> 00:55:47.540]   Why?
[00:55:47.540 --> 00:55:48.380]   - 'Cause you don't want it.
[00:55:48.380 --> 00:55:49.220]   - 'Cause you don't want it.
[00:55:49.220 --> 00:55:50.060]   - No, no, no, I like Acrobat Pro.
[00:55:50.060 --> 00:55:51.700]   I use it a lot to sign things and everything else.
[00:55:51.700 --> 00:55:52.900]   But it broke.
[00:55:52.900 --> 00:55:54.960]   I am too afraid to run the reinstall
[00:55:54.960 --> 00:56:08.560]   because on another machine, the re-ins
[00:56:08.560 --> 00:56:11.160]   and the other thing else is gonna break and it's gonna take me down.
[00:56:11.160 --> 00:56:13.560]   The virus that Adobe got with, from Macromedia,
[00:56:13.560 --> 00:56:16.600]   as far as how they manage DRM,
[00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:19.000]   has turned something that was usually fairly simple
[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:19.880]   into a nightmare.
[00:56:19.880 --> 00:56:22.800]   You know, and the thing is, is every time I deal with,
[00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:28.800]   specifically CS4, I just think I can't wait until the App Store.
[00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:34.280]   - So we figure, end of 2011, I mean, end of January 2011,
[00:56:34.280 --> 00:56:36.560]   all of these announcements will happen at the same time.
[00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:40.080]   The rumors are that the iWork 11 will come out then.
[00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:42.880]   And that makes sense that you would hold onto iWork 11
[00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:45.120]   and ship it when you're open up the store.
[00:56:45.120 --> 00:56:48.200]   - Yeah, I'm also kind of wondering how much of iWork 11
[00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:52.640]   is an incorporate technology that will be supported
[00:56:52.640 --> 00:56:56.160]   by the next editions of GIAWIS and the next iPad.
[00:56:56.160 --> 00:56:58.640]   So that's kind of interesting to me.
[00:56:58.640 --> 00:57:00.400]   - I'm really hoping I'm gonna predict
[00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:02.040]   that I'm just saying it's kind of interesting to me.
[00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:07.040]   I think that, I mean, I'm really hoping we see more cloud.
[00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:08.680]   You know, I think that's the big thing.
[00:57:08.680 --> 00:57:09.520]   It's integrating that.
[00:57:09.520 --> 00:57:11.400]   - I think that's what North Carolina is all about.
[00:57:11.400 --> 00:57:13.040]   - I don't know if that's what North Carolina is all about,
[00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:14.080]   but I think for the new iWork,
[00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:15.720]   if you're especially if you're going through this iOS thing,
[00:57:15.720 --> 00:57:16.960]   I'm being able to edit.
[00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:20.000]   I think the big thing is I can edit my office documents
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:22.600]   on my laptop, on my iPad, on my iPhone,
[00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:24.360]   and I don't have to, and it's all seamless,
[00:57:24.360 --> 00:57:26.720]   and they're all integrated, and it's all on my .Mac account.
[00:57:26.720 --> 00:57:30.320]   I mean, I think that if they don't have that narrative,
[00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:32.920]   I think that they're gonna get some blowback.
[00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:36.040]   - What a thrill it would be if Apple just whipped out
[00:57:36.040 --> 00:57:37.360]   the checkbook and said, you know what,
[00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:38.480]   let's just buy Dropbox.
[00:57:38.480 --> 00:57:39.880]   This is too taking too long.
[00:57:39.880 --> 00:57:41.560]   Less buy Dropbox.
[00:57:41.560 --> 00:57:42.400]   - Would it be a thrill?
[00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:45.360]   Or would you, I mean, I love Dropbox.
[00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:46.920]   I worry about Apple owning it.
[00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:51.000]   - As a guy who uses mostly Apple hardware,
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:52.360]   I'm not worried about Apple owning it.
[00:57:52.360 --> 00:57:53.360]   - Yeah.
[00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:56.600]   - As a guy who uses it both Apple and Windows, I am.
[00:57:56.600 --> 00:57:59.160]   - Of course, we use in Pogo Plugmore actually now,
[00:57:59.160 --> 00:58:01.360]   because then we have unlimited storage
[00:58:01.360 --> 00:58:03.200]   and has much of the same functionality.
[00:58:03.200 --> 00:58:06.400]   - I don't think that would be bad news for Windows people,
[00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:08.920]   for people who don't rely on iOS or other things,
[00:58:08.920 --> 00:58:11.080]   'cause they've already demonstrated the iTunes app
[00:58:11.080 --> 00:58:14.520]   that it can support multiple platforms very, very well.
[00:58:14.520 --> 00:58:17.520]   The, what I like about the Dropbox idea is that
[00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:19.680]   they would just simply, you know,
[00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:22.960]   you just take off one little slap on another
[00:58:22.960 --> 00:58:25.160]   and simply add so many different people
[00:58:25.160 --> 00:58:26.720]   to the Apple Cloud computing team
[00:58:26.720 --> 00:58:29.640]   that already have a great service out of the box.
[00:58:29.640 --> 00:58:31.680]   It's actually been running.
[00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:36.440]   I'm not sure that they are ever gonna get the mobile movie
[00:58:36.440 --> 00:58:40.600]   and I just get to the same level of usefulness as Dropbox.
[00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:42.440]   I mean, look at what they did.
[00:58:42.440 --> 00:58:46.120]   Dropbox did just by actively courting co-developers
[00:58:46.120 --> 00:58:48.960]   and making sure their APIs were very, very flexible.
[00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:51.960]   They pretty much now own the cloud storage market
[00:58:51.960 --> 00:58:54.080]   for the iPad and the iDevices.
[00:58:54.080 --> 00:58:56.680]   Boxed on that is very good, other services are very good,
[00:58:56.680 --> 00:58:59.640]   but Dropbox is the one service that you have to have,
[00:58:59.640 --> 00:59:01.920]   you have to support if your app is gonna be
[00:59:01.920 --> 00:59:03.560]   really supporting cloud computing.
[00:59:03.560 --> 00:59:04.960]   That is one health achievement,
[00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:07.280]   especially when you consider that Apple owns,
[00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:09.160]   especially their own network storage feature
[00:59:09.160 --> 00:59:12.640]   that so many different Mac users already have built in.
[00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:13.960]   - Oh, we've got Merlin Manback.
[00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:14.960]   I'm so relieved.
[00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:16.280]   Sorry about that, Merlin.
[00:59:16.280 --> 00:59:17.520]   I'm not sure what happened.
[00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:19.200]   I think it was our end, not yours.
[00:59:19.200 --> 00:59:21.040]   - Oh, it was probably mine.
[00:59:21.040 --> 00:59:23.560]   Are you talking about this rogue storage facility
[00:59:23.560 --> 00:59:24.400]   that they've got going?
[00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:25.280]   - Well, we were talking about North Carolina,
[00:59:25.280 --> 00:59:26.800]   but then Andy's posited.
[00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:29.200]   Wouldn't he be happy if Apple just bit the bullet
[00:59:29.200 --> 00:59:31.360]   and said, all right, our own solutions aren't working.
[00:59:31.360 --> 00:59:33.040]   Let's just buy Dropbox.
[00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:35.760]   - I've said it since like the third hour I use Dropbox.
[00:59:35.760 --> 00:59:37.800]   And I know most acquisitions these days
[00:59:37.800 --> 00:59:39.760]   are usually about talent rather than,
[00:59:39.760 --> 00:59:41.320]   I mean, they obviously have some kind
[00:59:41.320 --> 00:59:42.440]   of infrastructure in place.
[00:59:42.440 --> 00:59:43.440]   - How much would it cost?
[00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:46.680]   I mean, they got $51 billion burning a hole in their pocket.
[00:59:46.680 --> 00:59:48.600]   Lay a couple of billion on those Dropbox could do.
[00:59:48.600 --> 00:59:49.440]   - Wouldn't even be a carlion.
[00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:52.120]   - But some of those resources into polishing the integration
[00:59:52.120 --> 00:59:54.440]   with mobile me rather than trying to,
[00:59:54.440 --> 00:59:56.560]   as we used to say back in the day, boil the ocean.
[00:59:56.560 --> 00:59:59.840]   I mean, if somebody else has that solution and it works,
[00:59:59.840 --> 01:00:00.680]   I always wondered though,
[01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:01.680]   I mean, like I'm one of the people
[01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:04.120]   that flipped on the eternal backup stuff.
[01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:07.160]   I have no idea how they're gonna settle scale over time.
[01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:09.560]   But you know, Amazon just AWS,
[01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:10.400]   is that what it's called?
[01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:11.920]   Just reduced it, they just reduced prices.
[01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:12.760]   I mean.
[01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:14.080]   - Amazon Web Services.
[01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:15.120]   - Everyone's making big moves.
[01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:17.200]   Amazon did that same week, box.net,
[01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:19.560]   announced that they're gonna give you now 10 times
[01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:21.760]   as much storage as they used to on all
[01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:23.000]   their paid plans.
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:26.840]   And they're also adding more enterprise features to it.
[01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:30.280]   Although box is clearly going more towards enterprise usage
[01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:32.400]   as opposed to just ordinary people who want
[01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:34.640]   their infinite five gigabyte flash drive.
[01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:37.160]   - My thing with Dropbox,
[01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:39.400]   and I think this is coming in a future release
[01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:41.040]   is that, I say this every week,
[01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:43.960]   but I still that ability, this is gonna be my Alex.
[01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:44.800]   I'm gonna call this.
[01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:47.760]   - Alex wants to open source OS 10.
[01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:49.080]   What do you want, Merlin?
[01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:50.240]   - I just want iTunes.
[01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:55.240]   - Okay, now what I want it to let me select a tree,
[01:00:55.240 --> 01:00:58.240]   a part of the tree that goes in a certain place.
[01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:00.320]   - Supposedly that's imminent.
[01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:02.840]   - I've got 53 gigs available, but no way,
[01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:04.600]   am I gonna put 53 gigs on there.
[01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:07.480]   I would put, you know, I'd love to have most
[01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:09.840]   of my iTunes on there, but I, you know what I mean?
[01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:11.360]   That would be so much easier than trying to sync
[01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:13.360]   between computers, but I mean,
[01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:15.800]   I think that's where it's gonna have to end up going.
[01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:16.640]   But I agree with you.
[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:18.520]   I mean, it makes no sense to me.
[01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:19.560]   I'm not a business guy,
[01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:21.320]   but I don't understand why Apple doesn't just buy them
[01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:23.600]   or something, something, replicate that
[01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:28.200]   and just give everybody, even just a gig, just give people.
[01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:31.560]   - Well, yeah, Microsoft has SkyDrive, it's five gigs.
[01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:33.640]   - Like gig is free, my frozen?
[01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:35.840]   - No, you're not frozen, you're just cold.
[01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:36.680]   - Mm.
[01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:39.960]   - Might be Dropbox running, let me make sure it's out.
[01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:41.640]   - Turn off your sync.
[01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:43.840]   - But I'm glad that just seems like a new brainer to me.
[01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:45.120]   To get to that point where like, yeah,
[01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:48.080]   the iPad doesn't need a computer to sync.
[01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:49.800]   You turn it on, you're like, that's the nice thing
[01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:51.560]   about that G1, when I flipped on the G1,
[01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:53.760]   even the even the G1, I flipped it on,
[01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:54.600]   my stuff was there.
[01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:55.440]   - Yeah.
[01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:56.480]   - It just was fantastic.
[01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:57.800]   - I think more and more you're gonna see mobile
[01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:00.400]   leading the way actually for this cloud computing
[01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:02.040]   and this idea, you know?
[01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:02.880]   'Cause you don't have storage.
[01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:05.880]   - Cloud computing is really going somewhere with mobile.
[01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:07.160]   - Well, don't you?
[01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:10.000]   - Well, no, I mean, that is not kind of a tautology.
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.200]   So you're saying like, you're saying as well as,
[01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:14.080]   it'll, obviously it's for mobile,
[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:14.920]   but you're saying also--
[01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:16.680]   - Well, I think what happens is you get used
[01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:18.600]   to the fact that you log into your account
[01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:19.960]   and it's all there as you said, Merlin,
[01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:22.440]   and your phone obviously doesn't have any storage,
[01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:24.120]   so it has to.
[01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:25.600]   - HTML5 is the other one.
[01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:27.280]   I got the CRM that I use.
[01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:29.720]   - Has an HTML5 app, so like,
[01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:32.320]   everything's just synced all the time, it just goes.
[01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:33.160]   - Yeah.
[01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:36.640]   - Love it.
[01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:39.440]   - I wonder if somebody's just saying in the chat room,
[01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:41.000]   take the hard drive out of the air
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.400]   and just use Dropbox.
[01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:44.960]   If you had enough bandwidth, you could.
[01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:46.840]   I mean, it's a bandwidth issue, obviously.
[01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:48.120]   - Yeah, companies would like that.
[01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:49.040]   - Yeah.
[01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:51.400]   - If we had 100 megabit connections that were--
[01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:53.600]   - In Sweden, you could do that.
[01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:54.440]   - Yes.
[01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:57.320]   - Back to what Oracle was trying to get to in the 90s.
[01:02:57.320 --> 01:02:59.000]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:02.280]   - Barry Olsen, let's start, I don't know.
[01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:05.320]   - I remember when, this is nothing against New England, Andy,
[01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:08.680]   but when I first started moving a lot of my stuff
[01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:11.560]   into what now was called the cloud,
[01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:13.880]   I remember I was all like, yeah, 37 signals, yay,
[01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:14.800]   hard drive suck.
[01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:19.800]   And I remember standing in my mother-in-law's yard
[01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:23.040]   in Stu's side of Providence.
[01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:25.840]   You know this area, you know, Barrington.
[01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:27.720]   I'm standing there in Barrington, I got nothing.
[01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:30.160]   I got no bars, I got nothing, I got no Gs.
[01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:33.080]   And you start to think cloud computing
[01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:35.400]   is really in the past been for people
[01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:37.280]   with an ethernet connection.
[01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:38.760]   - Because if you don't have thinking with it,
[01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:39.600]   it's kind of pointless.
[01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:40.440]   - Exactly.
[01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:42.160]   A lot of my work is done on a plane.
[01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:45.040]   And so for me, cloud computing hasn't,
[01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:46.280]   I mean, when I'm in the clouds,
[01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:47.640]   I can't be connected to the cloud.
[01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:50.520]   That's really the sadness.
[01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:51.760]   - I think Dropbox is getting there
[01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:53.560]   and that stuff like land-based thinking.
[01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:54.800]   Do you guys, are you using the versions
[01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:56.240]   that have land syncing?
[01:03:56.240 --> 01:03:58.920]   So two of your boxes are on the same land.
[01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:00.800]   It syncs locally rather than through the cloud.
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:02.720]   So it's a lot faster.
[01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:04.560]   - Yeah, well, that's why I always thought
[01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:06.000]   that Dropbox is the best solution
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:09.440]   where it's not just sending your files off
[01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:10.560]   to never, never, never land.
[01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:12.880]   It will just simply copy every file you have,
[01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:15.360]   everywhere that you have Dropbox installed.
[01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:17.560]   And not only that, but you can rewind any file
[01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:19.400]   to any state it's ever been.
[01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:21.200]   And then--
[01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:22.680]   - Smallest files first.
[01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:25.080]   Smallest files first, which is so smart.
[01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:28.560]   - And the end of the pitch is, oh, and by the way, it's free.
[01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:29.880]   - Yeah.
[01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:32.520]   - I just, I was just on Dropbox.
[01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:35.160]   I wanted to double check that air sharing feature.
[01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:37.680]   By the way, yes, you can get a URL to a PDF
[01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:39.800]   and it will download it directly to air share.
[01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:43.240]   But I was reminded that I'm paying 50 gigabytes
[01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:44.920]   and using barely a fraction of it.
[01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:47.400]   And the reason why I'm paying 50 gigabytes is that
[01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:50.280]   I was, after three months of using Dropbox,
[01:04:50.280 --> 01:05:02.400]   I was filled with an all-pig
[01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:03.240]   - I agree.
[01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:07.680]   - If I could, if they have a special, you know, put money
[01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:10.640]   on pennies and just said, is that, if it fits a chip
[01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:11.440]   box of quarters?
[01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:12.560]   - I totally agree.
[01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:14.280]   I have a friend on Tumblr that said something like that
[01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:17.160]   not long ago and it articulated something I really believe,
[01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:19.920]   which is I get nervous when I can't pay for something.
[01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:20.760]   You know?
[01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:22.520]   And so like, I don't know what's going to happen with it.
[01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:23.160]   Yeah, right?
[01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:23.680]   - I agree.
[01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:24.440]   Yeah, pay for it.
[01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:25.080]   Yeah.
[01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:28.280]   - You feel like your mom's saying, it's lovely,
[01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:29.560]   but are you making any money?
[01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:31.040]   You're making any money.
[01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:32.960]   - Can I give you a few bucks?
[01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:34.360]   You need anything?
[01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:36.720]   - It's like your mom going like, well, you should like
[01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:40.080]   the goldfish, but you shouldn't like the goldfish.
[01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:41.400]   Is it going to go away?
[01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:42.400]   You know?
[01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:44.440]   It's like, no, no, I want the goldfish to stay alive.
[01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:46.560]   Let me pay goldfish.
[01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:48.480]   - I find myself a lot of times telling people if I want
[01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:50.960]   to do something for free, that I always have to explain
[01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:52.360]   to them what the business model is for it.
[01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:54.240]   So they get that I'm not just doing this for free.
[01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:56.800]   There is a reason for this and it's not just that, you know?
[01:05:56.800 --> 01:05:57.480]   - Yeah, other ways.
[01:05:57.480 --> 01:05:58.960]   - But there's business models and there's business models
[01:05:58.960 --> 01:05:59.800]   and that's the problem.
[01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:01.200]   I know everybody has a business model, even if they're
[01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:02.120]   giving it away.
[01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:02.560]   - Mm.
[01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:04.320]   - Doesn't mean the X-marks had X-marks.
[01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:05.160]   - They had a business model.
[01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:06.760]   - They didn't know what those are.
[01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:09.320]   - Well, but Vox is a good one where I put stuff up there.
[01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:09.680]   - Yeah.
[01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:12.200]   - You know, and we tied a business model and it adds.
[01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:13.080]   - It didn't.
[01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:14.120]   - How many users Leo?
[01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:16.320]   How many users did X-marks have?
[01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:18.400]   - It was several hundred thousand, as I remember.
[01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:19.480]   - There's a lot, right?
[01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:21.160]   - The issue was-- - And it's still going to save it?
[01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:22.760]   - Yeah, it looks like they are going to save it.
[01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:24.000]   I don't know if they're going to save it with a premium
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.280]   solution or somebody's going to swoop in, but apparently,
[01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:27.040]   it's still running.
[01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:29.280]   And the issue they said was, oh, we had--
[01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:30.240]   here was our business model.
[01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:34.160]   We were going to collect a lot of bookmarks and data mine them.
[01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:35.680]   And they were going to be very useful,
[01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:38.040]   but didn't quite work out that way.
[01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:40.280]   Hey, let's quickly-- - Yeah, I was so careful.
[01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:41.840]   - Going up the smarts. - I love this.
[01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:44.400]   - Every one of those screens I read every single letter of that.
[01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:46.240]   - What are they doing with it? - Every single one.
[01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:47.560]   - Yeah, yeah, what are they going to do with it?
[01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:48.720]   - Yeah, yep. - Right.
[01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:52.960]   - See if you can name the company that is running this ad.
[01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:56.440]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:06:56.440 --> 01:06:59.320]   - Yeah.
[01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:08.920]   - It's an iPad and a MIFI, and the roof is coming off his house.
[01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:11.520]   That's a selling point.
[01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:14.720]   I believe they're raising the roof because--
[01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:18.240]   - He's now sitting in his yard without a house.
[01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:20.640]   That's where his house used to be.
[01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:21.960]   I'm not sure I understand.
[01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:24.480]   Rule the air, it says Verizon.
[01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:27.040]   This is a-- Verizon's iPad ad.
[01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:29.720]   - Keep watching the skies.
[01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:32.560]   - So I have all those options.
[01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:35.000]   - I'm trying to do my own little ad here.
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:36.200]   - OK, there we go. - Let's see.
[01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:37.760]   - Nene, nene, nene. - I think all of us do.
[01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:39.680]   - Nene, nene, nene. - I had a MIFI,
[01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:42.160]   and then when I bought the Droid X, it has tethering,
[01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:43.800]   so I use that.
[01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:45.040]   - Yeah, so I have it.
[01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:49.280]   And the thing is I do find that I use it when AT&T breaks down,
[01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:53.280]   I like having my MIFI as a backup for that.
[01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:54.920]   - Here's the deal. - I was thinking of installing a MIFI
[01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:55.840]   permanently in my car.
[01:07:55.840 --> 01:07:57.200]   - Here's the problem with the Verizon deal.
[01:07:57.200 --> 01:08:02.040]   So it's a WIFI iPad, and it's a MIFI locked to the WIFI iPad.
[01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:03.600]   So it's not-- - Really?
[01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:05.280]   - Yeah. - Oh, screw that.
[01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:06.120]   Why would you do that?
[01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:08.200]   - And they charge you the same price
[01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:11.960]   as it would cost for a 3G iPad, 120 bucks more than the WIFI iPad.
[01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:13.440]   - Whoop, whoop, whoop.
[01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:15.360]   - Well, if somebody's not paying attention,
[01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:16.680]   it would be fooled by it, I guess.
[01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:18.760]   - This, 'cause I'll say, I don't know if I make my money back
[01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:21.480]   on this every month, but-- - Oh, I love WIFI.
[01:08:21.480 --> 01:08:22.640]   - It's a lot of dough.
[01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:26.040]   But if amortized over a year, I fight travel--
[01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:27.720]   Sometimes I'll travel three times in one month,
[01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:29.600]   and then not at all for, you know how it works.
[01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:32.160]   But it's like how many nights of like 10 or 20 bucks a night,
[01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:33.440]   and I'm just pretty soon, I'm like,
[01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:36.120]   five devices work on this, and it just works.
[01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:38.200]   And it's secure, it's secure, right?
[01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:40.680]   I mean, more so, I'm not gonna have that Thundercloud deal
[01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:43.600]   or whatever, where people are stealing my cookie.
[01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:47.160]   - Easily from the hotel stays, airports,
[01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:48.440]   and all that stuff. - Airports.
[01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:50.640]   - It is, the MIFI pays for me,
[01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:51.720]   it pays for it every month.
[01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:53.240]   - I'm trying to, by the way, we should explain,
[01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:56.200]   MIFI is a credit card sized device that Verizon
[01:08:56.200 --> 01:08:59.440]   and Sprint both sell, that has a 3G built into it
[01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:01.000]   and becomes a WIFI access point
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:02.800]   that you can use with five devices.
[01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:04.160]   - Yeah. - I'm trying to find out
[01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:06.600]   if the MIFI that sold with the Verizon iPad
[01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:07.760]   is in fact like the iPad.
[01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:10.640]   I was told it was, now my chat room says no, it's not,
[01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:12.480]   but I don't think anybody owns one, so we don't know for sure.
[01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:13.560]   - But the here's the only, I guess the whole thing
[01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:14.680]   was Verizon's. - It would be crazy, right?
[01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:16.120]   But on the other hand, that's how they--
[01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:16.960]   - Why would you bother?
[01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:18.080]   Just go to Apple and buy an iPad,
[01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:19.720]   then just go to Verizon and buy them MIFI.
[01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:21.960]   There's no reason, I mean-- - It's convenience.
[01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:23.400]   - I guess the problem is that I got to--
[01:09:23.400 --> 01:09:25.520]   - They're charging less, they're not charging 60 bucks a month.
[01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:27.240]   - I will tell you that if you have any interest
[01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:30.080]   in something like Apple care, which I get
[01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:32.040]   for just about everything that I buy,
[01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:34.160]   don't buy it anywhere other than Apple.
[01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:38.800]   You know, it's an Apple, it is, it's done while you order it.
[01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:42.040]   When you buy it at AT&T or Verizon or Amazon,
[01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:43.440]   you have to do it later and let me tell you,
[01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:45.760]   I didn't, something didn't get synced up
[01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:47.880]   when I bought my kids computers on Amazon
[01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:50.720]   and now it's like this huge thing every time,
[01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:54.120]   the computers get re-synced and I was like,
[01:09:54.120 --> 01:09:56.680]   okay, I'm always buying my Apple hardware from Apple
[01:09:56.680 --> 01:09:57.520]   and just call it a day
[01:09:57.520 --> 01:10:00.120]   'cause it's too much of a pain in the neck.
[01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:02.520]   - Still trying to figure out whether that MIFI
[01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:03.640]   is tied to the iPad.
[01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:05.360]   I believe it is because I think they charge you
[01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:07.160]   the special $22.
[01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:09.440]   - I mean, just buy it, so here's the deal.
[01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:11.240]   Verizon MIFI, great.
[01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:12.480]   Don't bother buying an iPad there,
[01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:13.400]   that's just a waste of time.
[01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:16.640]   - And you won't get the GPS if you get the Wi-Fi iPads.
[01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:18.520]   - You only sell those iPads at Target?
[01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:19.840]   - Oh yeah, everywhere now.
[01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:21.880]   - Walmart, Target, everywhere.
[01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:22.720]   - Wow, that's amazing.
[01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:25.520]   - I was at the AT&T store and they have iPads on the wall.
[01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:28.000]   - I was watching my son, my son has my old Wi-Fi one
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:29.920]   and my three year old son.
[01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:34.920]   And he's not allowed to use it when the son is up.
[01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:37.600]   You know, that's the rule.
[01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:39.240]   - So when it's dark, I just want him out like,
[01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:40.080]   - It's like drinking.
[01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:40.920]   - I just want him out.
[01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:43.280]   - I want him out of the yard, I'm handing that iPad.
[01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:46.480]   - I want him outside having fun doing, you know,
[01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:47.840]   - And I'll take a bloody marriage too
[01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:48.680]   when he gets mad.
[01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:52.520]   - You know, and the thing is, is that watching him interact
[01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:55.920]   with that, I mean, he is become so facile,
[01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:57.640]   you know, with what he wants and how he does it.
[01:10:57.640 --> 01:11:00.160]   And he's got a mixture of drawing apps and games
[01:11:00.160 --> 01:11:02.880]   and he can watch Netflix and not Netflix,
[01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:04.280]   iTunes or whatever.
[01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:07.440]   And it's amazing to watch him just kind of jump
[01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:09.680]   and watch him slow down and speed up and everything else.
[01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:12.280]   But I realize he's never gonna really wanna use a keyboard.
[01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:13.760]   Like he's, by the time he's five or six,
[01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:15.880]   I don't know if he's gonna ever learn how to type.
[01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:18.040]   - Let me run through a couple of stories real quickly
[01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:20.120]   and we'll get to our picks of the week.
[01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:22.080]   Amazon offers 70 30 revenue split
[01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:24.400]   to magazine and newspaper publishers.
[01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:26.280]   Amazon obviously feeling some competitive pressure
[01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:27.560]   at this point from not.
[01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:29.600]   - I thought they were already doing that.
[01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:32.400]   - Well, it's, it's, it's, it's,
[01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:35.640]   - I guess not.
[01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:36.560]   - It's better deal.
[01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:37.400]   I think it's a better deal.
[01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:39.520]   Is it not Andy than it was?
[01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:40.840]   - I think that originally they were doing
[01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:43.920]   as their standard 50/50 split to certain select partners
[01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:46.120]   that they were also offering better terms.
[01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:47.520]   - But Apple's doing 70/30.
[01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:48.360]   So this is, - Right.
[01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:49.180]   This is the same.
[01:11:49.180 --> 01:11:51.160]   - Anytime you see Amazon announced 70/30,
[01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:52.600]   there's one reason why they're doing that.
[01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:54.320]   - A P P, L E.
[01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:57.360]   Sky five, has anybody tried the beta with the group video chat
[01:11:57.360 --> 01:11:59.120]   and redesign interface?
[01:11:59.120 --> 01:11:59.960]   I don't dare.
[01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:01.320]   - I don't know anybody that has.
[01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:02.160]   - Yes.
[01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:03.560]   - Have you done it?
[01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:05.120]   Do you have it Andy?
[01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:07.280]   - Andy says don't mess you with Sky.
[01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:10.320]   - Andrew.
[01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:12.900]   (all laughing)
[01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:16.800]   - That's a, that is, by the way,
[01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:18.000]   stimulated Sky conversation.
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.120]   - I'm not working Sky conversation.
[01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:20.600]   No, I'm not using the, of course not.
[01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:21.440]   - Yeah.
[01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:22.760]   Okay.
[01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:23.600]   - Let's see here.
[01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:27.120]   Apple increasing music previews in the US on iTunes 2,
[01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:29.240]   90 seconds, that's nice.
[01:12:29.240 --> 01:12:30.080]   - That's smart.
[01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:32.880]   - Most songs, that's all I want, to be honest.
[01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:35.080]   - See, and the thing is though, there are a lot of,
[01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:38.880]   especially on these albums that have lots and lots of tracks
[01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:41.560]   on them, there are so, a lot of track that are less
[01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:44.480]   than 90 seconds, there's some, they might be giants tracks,
[01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:46.120]   I think, that are, that go to.
[01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:46.960]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:47.800]   - When you hear the whole song.
[01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:48.640]   - Yeah.
[01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:49.480]   - Yeah.
[01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:50.320]   - Please pass the milk, please.
[01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:51.400]   Please pass the milk.
[01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:52.880]   - If a song's that short.
[01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:53.720]   - Okay.
[01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:55.240]   - Yeah, you can't, you can't even screw it out
[01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:56.080]   of a bucket, be not it.
[01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:58.560]   - Yeah, you know what, yeah, exactly.
[01:12:58.560 --> 01:12:59.400]   - There's some Smith songs.
[01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:02.560]   - Did anybody get Skyfire before it, before it imploded?
[01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:05.600]   This is the browser that plays Flash on an iPhone.
[01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:08.040]   - Apparently a lot of people want Flash on their iPhone.
[01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:10.480]   - I use Skyfire on, on Android.
[01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:12.800]   It's nice, it's a, it's a nice browser, it's a good browser.
[01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:14.640]   And then they have this kind of nice little thing
[01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:16.760]   where they cache Flash videos
[01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:20.440]   and play it back from their server in H.264.
[01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:21.680]   So it performs better.
[01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:22.920]   - I have to admit, when I saw this,
[01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:24.800]   I was just like, there is no way those are gonna survive.
[01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:25.640]   - Well, you could do that.
[01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:28.000]   - That's what happened is, it was a free browser.
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:28.840]   Was it free?
[01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:30.400]   I don't even know, I think it was free.
[01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:31.480]   - I think it's like $2.99.
[01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:33.760]   - $2.99, well, their servers couldn't keep up with the demand.
[01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:36.360]   So they had a, it's the first time ever I've seen
[01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:39.680]   an iPhone app that they had to pull back due to demand.
[01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:42.360]   - Well, but the thing is, but it's just that you,
[01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:44.240]   it's a heavy break point.
[01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:46.000]   I mean, that's the whole issue is,
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:47.320]   is that you're now putting it on,
[01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:49.720]   now if they put it on an S3 server or something like that,
[01:13:49.720 --> 01:13:50.560]   that would make more sense.
[01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:52.560]   - But then of course, they would run them into the ground.
[01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:54.440]   But there's no, if you're not popular,
[01:13:54.440 --> 01:13:55.280]   no one's gonna use it.
[01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:57.120]   And if you are popular, you're dead.
[01:13:57.120 --> 01:13:57.960]   You know, that was--
[01:13:57.960 --> 01:13:58.800]   - Yeah, it's like tricking,
[01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:02.000]   it's one of those drinking salt water business models.
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:02.840]   - Or your own, you're right.
[01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:04.240]   - I mean, like you think you're, no, seriously,
[01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:06.920]   where the story about new orders,
[01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:09.200]   new order had this single called Blue Monday.
[01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:11.320]   This is the best selling single of all time.
[01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:12.840]   They had no idea when they put it out.
[01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:14.240]   The guy who designed it had,
[01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:16.320]   and supposedly this is not entirely true,
[01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:18.360]   but the guy who designed the Blue Monday cover,
[01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:20.560]   it was like, it wasn't just, it was spot printing.
[01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:22.400]   It wasn't just a regular process.
[01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:26.920]   It had like 11 spot colors on it with a die cut.
[01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:30.200]   And it was the biggest selling 12 inch of all time.
[01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:31.300]   - And they lost money on it.
[01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:32.800]   - They lost money on every record they sold.
[01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:34.800]   - Oh god, oh.
[01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:36.440]   But we'll make it up in volume.
[01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:38.840]   - Oh god, oh, that's horrible.
[01:14:38.840 --> 01:14:39.680]   - That's shit.
[01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:41.200]   - Terrible, terrible, terrible.
[01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:43.200]   Kind of you hope that doesn't happen.
[01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:44.240]   All right, let's take a break.
[01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:45.920]   When we come back, it'll be time for your picks
[01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:48.160]   so everybody get their picks ready.
[01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:49.880]   - That's why I seem in a ten-if.
[01:14:49.880 --> 01:14:52.560]   - Oh, yeah, Merlin's always sets up screenshots
[01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:55.920]   during the show. - I've got one, but yeah.
[01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:57.920]   - I'll tell you what, I'm gonna talk about Drobo.
[01:14:57.920 --> 01:15:00.600]   You do what you need to do, Merlin, man.
[01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:03.640]   Drobo, I got a Drobo FS in my closet at home.
[01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:05.320]   I love it.
[01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:07.200]   I'm coming out of the closet for Drobo.
[01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:10.520]   Drobo is the data storage solution.
[01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:12.000]   If you actually wanted to know more about it,
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:13.680]   go to Drobo.com/MacBreak.
[01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:15.760]   You can see all of, you know,
[01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:17.840]   Callie Lewis made some really great videos.
[01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:19.880]   There's videos from Drobo users.
[01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:22.920]   I think everybody sitting in this room is a Drobo user.
[01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:25.160]   - We're a heavy Drobo user.
[01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:26.000]   What is Drobo?
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:30.040]   It's an enclosure from anywhere to four to eight disks,
[01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:32.160]   depending on which Drobo model you get.
[01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:34.240]   - It's the square space of hard drives.
[01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:35.280]   You don't have to really think about it.
[01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:38.080]   You just simply say I would like to add my stuff
[01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:39.160]   backed up in Daima.
[01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:41.680]   - I got red lights on one of mine with four.
[01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:42.840]   So I'm too...
[01:15:42.840 --> 01:15:44.400]   - So what you do when you get a red light,
[01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:45.560]   that's one of the things I like about it.
[01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:47.680]   Drobo's on the front of the Drobo face,
[01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:49.960]   which is by the way, magnetically attached.
[01:15:49.960 --> 01:15:52.040]   So it's easy to just pop it off.
[01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:54.400]   On the front though, they've got these lights.
[01:15:54.400 --> 01:15:57.120]   Let me see if I can pull up the picture here.
[01:15:57.120 --> 01:15:59.720]   And they're green when there's plenty of capacity.
[01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:01.800]   Everything's running fine, but then they go to orange
[01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:03.280]   when you're running low on a disk.
[01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:05.160]   And red when your disk is full.
[01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:07.760]   Now to add capacity, all you have to do is pop off
[01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:09.600]   the front, pop out the drive.
[01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:11.080]   You don't even have to turn the Drobo off,
[01:16:11.080 --> 01:16:13.840]   although Alex says you should, but you don't have to.
[01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:15.840]   You pop out the drive, pop in a new drive.
[01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:16.920]   - I can see you turn it off.
[01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:18.160]   - It's not profitable.
[01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:19.360]   - Yeah, I pop 'em out while they're...
[01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:20.520]   - Oh, I thought you were one of the people.
[01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:21.680]   - That's the whole demo, that's the...
[01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:22.520]   - Yeah, no, I know.
[01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:24.040]   - It's hot, it's not while you're working.
[01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:25.480]   - You pop it out.
[01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:26.720]   So you take out the smallest drive,
[01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:28.560]   you put in a big new two terabyte drive.
[01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:29.920]   All of a sudden the Drobo rebuilds
[01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:32.960]   and you've got now more capacity without losing a bit.
[01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:36.040]   Four drives means, you know, that's the basic Drobo
[01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:38.800]   with a USB 2 and FireWire 800.
[01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:42.040]   It takes about a third, maybe a little less than a third
[01:16:42.040 --> 01:16:45.120]   of the total capacity for data redundancy,
[01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:46.520]   but you also get the speed benefit.
[01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:49.000]   The Drobo S is perfect for storing lots more data
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.800]   with five drives up to 10 terabytes,
[01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:53.640]   and I think three terabyte drives are coming,
[01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:55.760]   it'll accommodate those just fine.
[01:16:55.760 --> 01:16:57.960]   And it also is speedier, that's E-SATA
[01:16:57.960 --> 01:17:01.480]   as well as FireWire 800 or FireWire or USB 2.
[01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:03.560]   The Drobo FS, that's the NAS that I have,
[01:17:03.560 --> 01:17:05.720]   that's a really cool gigabit ethernet.
[01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:08.600]   Then the Drobo Pro and the Drobo Elite,
[01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:12.280]   these are eight drives Merlin eight, count 'em.
[01:17:12.280 --> 01:17:13.380]   Sixteen terabytes.
[01:17:13.380 --> 01:17:15.320]   (mimics Drobo)
[01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:17.600]   - I, you don't have those do you?
[01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:18.440]   - Yeah we do.
[01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:19.440]   - You're insane.
[01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:20.880]   - Well here's the, we edit Mac break,
[01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:23.520]   we edit all of the shows off, we have five IMACs.
[01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:24.360]   - It's fascinating if you can edit it.
[01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:26.320]   - Five IMACs connected to it and I,
[01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:27.520]   in some ways-- - Is it an ice-gutty?
[01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:28.360]   Ice-guzzy?
[01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:29.200]   - Yeah, ice-guzzy.
[01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:32.080]   - And the thing is, I asked, people had asked on the,
[01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:34.360]   after I said this on the last time we talked about this,
[01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:36.720]   is are they actually editing from the drive
[01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:37.560]   and the answers? - Yes.
[01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:38.680]   - So all the computers are looking at it,
[01:17:38.680 --> 01:17:39.920]   they're all editing from those drives.
[01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:41.400]   - These elites and their work tools.
[01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:44.160]   - Gigabit ethernet ports and they use the ice-guzzy protocol
[01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:46.480]   over those gigabit ethernet so fast enough to edit.
[01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:48.080]   - That is really ballsy, Alex.
[01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:48.960]   - He's a ballsy ball.
[01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:50.840]   - Well it was, we did it for that.
[01:17:50.840 --> 01:17:52.320]   - Yeah Merlin, it's intended to do that.
[01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:53.160]   - Really?
[01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:54.000]   - On the production, wow.
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.480]   - Yes, they're basically a SAN.
[01:17:56.480 --> 01:17:58.160]   They of course support virtualization
[01:17:58.160 --> 01:18:00.440]   and all the other technologies.
[01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:02.560]   You can have up to 16, see we, on our SAN,
[01:18:02.560 --> 01:18:05.080]   we pay $1,000 for each additional seat.
[01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:06.080]   You don't pay that on the durable.
[01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:07.600]   You can have up to 16 people using it.
[01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:08.440]   - We don't have to.
[01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:09.280]   - I like having two of them
[01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:11.040]   because you run into that backup problem
[01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:12.640]   and so what I've done a couple times,
[01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:14.800]   yeah I know I'm rich guy, I buy a gigabyte disks
[01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:17.520]   but I think gigabyte right now is a sweet spot.
[01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:19.000]   - I don't know, you get a gigabyte.
[01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:19.840]   - I get two gigabytes.
[01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:20.680]   - You're talking terabyte.
[01:18:20.680 --> 01:18:21.520]   - You're talking terabyte.
[01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:22.360]   - Two terabytes.
[01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:23.200]   I don't know, one and a half terabytes.
[01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:25.920]   - How can you spend money on your data?
[01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:27.360]   - No, it's like full.
[01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:29.760]   - Why aren't you just inscribed it on stone
[01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:31.240]   like the rest of it?
[01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:33.000]   - Well it's like, well whatever you can afford to lose
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:33.880]   dude, invest.
[01:18:33.880 --> 01:18:36.600]   You know, and I get one gigabyte drives from,
[01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:39.440]   I usually got a new egg, they're like 80 bucks a piece.
[01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:41.760]   And what's great is if you got one with a,
[01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:43.520]   I think, I can't remember if I did,
[01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:46.400]   do they, I suppose Firewire 800 or USB,
[01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:48.040]   but anyhow, you pop in a bunch of disks
[01:18:48.040 --> 01:18:49.560]   and you can backup one drill, but the other.
[01:18:49.560 --> 01:18:51.240]   Stick those in a safe and stick them,
[01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:53.840]   put them somewhere, 'cause that's a lot of data to lose.
[01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:54.680]   - Right.
[01:18:54.680 --> 01:18:55.840]   - You know, that's the thing is you do need to back up.
[01:18:55.840 --> 01:18:57.240]   But so every drive you buy,
[01:18:57.240 --> 01:18:59.080]   you're kind of also buying other drives,
[01:18:59.080 --> 01:18:59.920]   you know what I mean?
[01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:01.800]   You have to kind of accept that that's part of being,
[01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:03.000]   it's called being an adult.
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.800]   But it's great to have that capacity with this
[01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:06.640]   instead of sitting around.
[01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:09.040]   - Wait a minute, Merlin, what is all this data storage
[01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:09.880]   that you got there?
[01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:11.880]   What do you do, I mean you're writer, it's text.
[01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:12.960]   What do you?
[01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:16.920]   - I am bad about having multiple copies of stuff,
[01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:18.440]   like everything my kids ever done,
[01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:20.120]   it's like, oh, put that all in this thing.
[01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:25.120]   And, but no, so basically music and legally obtained
[01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:27.840]   media in general and backup.
[01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:28.840]   - Oh, I get it.
[01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:29.680]   Now I understand.
[01:19:29.680 --> 01:19:32.600]   - Time machine, time machine of a box.
[01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:34.680]   I got three layers of backup to what I do,
[01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:36.680]   it's really insane and anal.
[01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:40.160]   But one level is I do a time machine to my Drobo,
[01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:42.240]   buy my desk through the day.
[01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:46.000]   I do an overnight image to one of my drives in my Mac Pro,
[01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.840]   and then I rotate off site with a monthly backup drive.
[01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:51.000]   So, and then in addition to that,
[01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:54.600]   I can, the one at home I use for media, but it's,
[01:19:54.600 --> 01:19:55.520]   I love it, I love it.
[01:19:55.520 --> 01:19:56.880]   I guess, I guess I'm just saying like,
[01:19:56.880 --> 01:19:58.560]   if you get behind this notion
[01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:00.120]   that you're just gonna have to buy hard drives,
[01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:02.560]   if you're an adult, like Drobo makes that a lot easier
[01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:03.960]   deal with as a. - It does.
[01:20:03.960 --> 01:20:04.800]   Yeah.
[01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:05.800]   - I wish I could put all the data,
[01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:08.320]   we have just piles and piles and piles of raw drives.
[01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:11.880]   And so this is the near line storage for what we do.
[01:20:11.880 --> 01:20:13.000]   But yeah, I keep all of my,
[01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.160]   all the photos of my kids and everything else on my Drobo's.
[01:20:15.160 --> 01:20:16.000]   I mean, I don't know.
[01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:17.960]   - How do you keep track of those naked drives?
[01:20:17.960 --> 01:20:18.860]   I mean, how do you like keep track
[01:20:18.860 --> 01:20:19.700]   because it's a on them?
[01:20:19.700 --> 01:20:20.540]   - That's a good answer.
[01:20:20.540 --> 01:20:23.140]   So there is a, what we do,
[01:20:23.140 --> 01:20:24.120]   naked drives. - Naked drives.
[01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:25.120]   - We have raw drives. - We have raw drives.
[01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:26.760]   - And we have those, you know,
[01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:28.240]   we be tech, whatever.
[01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:29.320]   And then there's actually. - Kind of one of those.
[01:20:29.320 --> 01:20:30.720]   It's two cases things.
[01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:31.760]   - Little things you probably,
[01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:33.040]   and then you have little cases for them.
[01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:33.920]   You put them in and they,
[01:20:33.920 --> 01:20:35.760]   it's just like having a cassette case.
[01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:36.800]   - We know what this.
[01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:37.640]   - Yeah, we have a cassette case.
[01:20:37.640 --> 01:20:39.640]   - So anyways, we go through probably 10 or 15.
[01:20:39.640 --> 01:20:41.280]   We're now to the point where I used to say
[01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:42.480]   five or six terabytes a week
[01:20:42.480 --> 01:20:44.760]   and it's really closer to 10 or 15 terabytes a week.
[01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:45.600]   - She's the weasel. - And so the.
[01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:46.440]   - What?
[01:20:46.440 --> 01:20:47.920]   - So the, what. - We sure it is.
[01:20:47.920 --> 01:20:49.360]   - That's if they look like a set case.
[01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:50.200]   - Yeah. - It's like they're right there.
[01:20:50.200 --> 01:20:51.040]   - Yeah.
[01:20:51.040 --> 01:20:55.520]   - So anyway, so the issue is that we go through
[01:20:55.520 --> 01:20:58.160]   a lot of the drives and what we do is we,
[01:20:58.160 --> 01:20:59.760]   you take them and we give them a name,
[01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:03.960]   a serial number basically that then we,
[01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:05.840]   so we put it on the drive and then we put it in
[01:21:05.840 --> 01:21:06.680]   and we scan it.
[01:21:06.680 --> 01:21:08.600]   So I think I use CD finder,
[01:21:08.600 --> 01:21:10.040]   but the other guys use distractor I think
[01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:11.240]   or something that's like distractor.
[01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:12.600]   I'll have to find out what they're using right now.
[01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:13.440]   - It's sort of off-line.
[01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:15.600]   - So what it does is it scans the entire drive
[01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:16.720]   and it pulls all those drives.
[01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:18.960]   We've got hundreds of drives in a database
[01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:20.320]   and all you do is, and we are.
[01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:22.320]   - It's all service. - We are maniacal
[01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:23.360]   about naming conventions.
[01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:25.360]   And so naming conventions, folder structures,
[01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:27.520]   because when you have good naming conventions
[01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:29.640]   and good folder structures, what you'll do is you'll just
[01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:33.800]   type in, I'm looking for, you know, you type in the client
[01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:36.120]   code or the job code and it'll say,
[01:21:36.120 --> 01:21:38.240]   oh, all that information's on these three drives
[01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:39.080]   or on this two drives.
[01:21:39.080 --> 01:21:39.920]   We can find everything in between.
[01:21:39.920 --> 01:21:43.160]   - You could grep basically down to like the one unusual,
[01:21:43.160 --> 01:21:44.000]   yeah, totally.
[01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:45.160]   - So you can just, if you do it,
[01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:46.800]   if you do it like four letter underscore,
[01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:48.360]   four letter underscore, four letter underscore,
[01:21:48.360 --> 01:21:51.200]   we can go over, you can go over eight characters
[01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:52.840]   and look at this and then that's what you look at.
[01:21:52.840 --> 01:21:53.680]   - You can rip this up.
[01:21:53.680 --> 01:21:54.720]   If you documented this Alex Lindsey,
[01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:55.560]   have you written all this up?
[01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:56.880]   - No, I don't know if we did.
[01:21:56.880 --> 01:21:57.720]   - That'd be a good thing to have.
[01:21:57.720 --> 01:21:59.120]   - We did early on, GMT or something.
[01:21:59.120 --> 01:21:59.960]   - Yeah, I'll do one on GMT.
[01:21:59.960 --> 01:22:01.560]   - I think we're all getting to a point
[01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:03.640]   where we would benefit from stuff like that.
[01:22:03.640 --> 01:22:05.280]   - I'll put it up, 'cause here's the thing,
[01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:08.040]   is that for big, raw data that we have,
[01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:09.600]   we put them on these raw drives,
[01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:11.360]   'cause it's the cheapest way to store them.
[01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:13.000]   The important stuff, we put it on two raw drives,
[01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.520]   'cause it's cheap and somewhat more stable.
[01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:17.040]   For the stuff that we really need to keep,
[01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:18.080]   we keep on the Drobo's.
[01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:19.440]   So the thing is, is that like, you know,
[01:22:19.440 --> 01:22:23.440]   so the Drobo has an archive of every final project
[01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:24.840]   that we've done, you know,
[01:22:24.840 --> 01:22:26.960]   and we're not almost every final project,
[01:22:26.960 --> 01:22:28.720]   and the stuff that we're working on the elite,
[01:22:28.720 --> 01:22:31.240]   just as keeping track of all the stuff that we've done.
[01:22:31.240 --> 01:22:32.080]   - All right, we're running out of time.
[01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:32.920]   So let me just finish this up.
[01:22:32.920 --> 01:22:35.360]   Just go to Drobo.com/MacBreak
[01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:37.480]   to find out more about the various models
[01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:40.520]   and save up to $500 off a populated Drobo
[01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:43.400]   when you use the coupon code MACBreak Weekly.
[01:22:43.400 --> 01:22:45.040]   Drobo from Data Robotics.
[01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:46.360]   I think you've probably got the idea.
[01:22:46.360 --> 01:22:48.720]   This is a good idea for you and your data.
[01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:49.560]   - It's Kayla.
[01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:51.080]   - Do you own me, home Drobo?
[01:22:51.080 --> 01:22:52.520]   - All right, time for you, Alex Lindsey,
[01:22:52.520 --> 01:22:54.160]   make a pick of the week.
[01:22:54.160 --> 01:22:55.080]   - Okay, so I have,
[01:22:55.080 --> 01:22:56.400]   - I hate these quick, we gotta go.
[01:22:56.400 --> 01:22:58.040]   - I got two real quick ones,
[01:22:58.040 --> 01:23:00.400]   one's adult and one's more kiddish.
[01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:03.320]   So we do a lot of, you know, we have to calculate a lot,
[01:23:03.320 --> 01:23:04.280]   oh, we were just talking about storage,
[01:23:04.280 --> 01:23:06.480]   and we have to calculate a lot of sizes,
[01:23:06.480 --> 01:23:08.520]   and there's a great little application,
[01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:10.080]   and I don't know how much it costs.
[01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:12.520]   It's the A.J.A. Data Calculator.
[01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:14.160]   And what it does is it literally,
[01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:15.760]   if you're trying to figure out video,
[01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:17.040]   and you're trying to figure out how much space
[01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:17.880]   is this gonna take?
[01:23:17.880 --> 01:23:19.960]   If I'm gonna capture Apple ProRes HQ,
[01:23:19.960 --> 01:23:22.680]   I can just type in, this is it,
[01:23:22.680 --> 01:23:24.720]   and it'll tell you how many gigabytes per hour
[01:23:24.720 --> 01:23:25.720]   that's gonna chew up,
[01:23:25.720 --> 01:23:27.520]   and allows us to calculate what kind of drives we need,
[01:23:27.520 --> 01:23:29.160]   and where we need to go, and so on and so forth.
[01:23:29.160 --> 01:23:31.960]   And so it's a little obscure.
[01:23:31.960 --> 01:23:34.080]   If you go to the App Store, I think you'll find it.
[01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:38.440]   It's an app for the iPhone.
[01:23:38.440 --> 01:23:40.280]   And sitting there and you have any discussion,
[01:23:40.280 --> 01:23:41.120]   and you're figuring out,
[01:23:41.120 --> 01:23:44.040]   like how many drives do I need to buy for this event?
[01:23:44.040 --> 01:23:45.560]   This is the typical problem that we have.
[01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:47.000]   - Boy, I do it so often.
[01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:48.320]   - Well, I do have a lot.
[01:23:48.320 --> 01:23:49.600]   - So, but what was funny is,
[01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:50.960]   there's a lot of people I know have this.
[01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:53.000]   And so I think that just if you don't know about it,
[01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:56.120]   and you're a pro, then you should think about that.
[01:23:56.120 --> 01:23:59.320]   And it's either free or 99 or 99 cents or something like that.
[01:23:59.320 --> 01:24:00.640]   So definitely worth getting.
[01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:03.720]   The second thing is itsy bitsy spider.
[01:24:03.720 --> 01:24:05.640]   - My itsy bitsy spider.
[01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:09.880]   - So I buy a lot of games and learning tools for my son,
[01:24:09.880 --> 01:24:11.160]   who's three, and let him play with them,
[01:24:11.160 --> 01:24:13.040]   and see which one's the sticks.
[01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:14.360]   So I'm just telling you, if you're a parent,
[01:24:14.360 --> 01:24:16.000]   this one really sticks.
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:20.600]   I mean, he just, sometimes he doesn't even call his iPad,
[01:24:20.600 --> 01:24:23.400]   his iPad, he just calls it his itsy bitsy spider.
[01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:26.800]   And he, and what's amazing is how much,
[01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:28.840]   there are a lot of complex interactions
[01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:30.560]   that are going on here to do lots of stuff,
[01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:32.600]   and he will spend, you know.
[01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:33.640]   - Well, this is a teaching tool.
[01:24:33.640 --> 01:24:34.480]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:36.040]   - If you poke the friendly fly,
[01:24:36.040 --> 01:24:38.480]   she'll answer 15 fast naming questions.
[01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:40.360]   And so there's lots of little things,
[01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:41.920]   but it's a real explore thing
[01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:44.240]   that he can keep on coming back to over and over and over again.
[01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:45.480]   - It's so funny, when my kids were growing up,
[01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:47.400]   it was CD-ROMs from Broderbund.
[01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:48.240]   (laughing)
[01:24:48.240 --> 01:24:50.560]   - Yeah, for now, and now it's iPhone apps.
[01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:51.640]   - Yeah, so that's really changed.
[01:24:51.640 --> 01:24:52.720]   - I just know that as a parent,
[01:24:52.720 --> 01:24:54.080]   I'm always wondering which ones are sticking,
[01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:55.680]   'cause there's so many of them out there,
[01:24:55.680 --> 01:24:58.080]   and at least from my son, that one really sticks.
[01:24:58.080 --> 01:24:59.360]   And so I'm gonna recommend it.
[01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:01.960]   - And this is iPhone or iPad, and the iPad, I would say.
[01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:03.960]   - Big, and that's the one you want, right?
[01:25:03.960 --> 01:25:04.960]   - He's got both of them.
[01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:06.320]   - Does he, you know, you buy it once,
[01:25:06.320 --> 01:25:07.160]   and then you put it on both of them.
[01:25:07.160 --> 01:25:08.520]   - Oh, it's universal.
[01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:09.920]   - Oh, that's nice.
[01:25:09.920 --> 01:25:11.240]   Does he prefer the iPad version?
[01:25:11.240 --> 01:25:12.080]   - He prefers the iPad version.
[01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:13.240]   - I think that would.
[01:25:13.240 --> 01:25:16.360]   - Yeah, I have a hard time selling them on the iPhone.
[01:25:16.360 --> 01:25:19.320]   - And now Merlin, man, it is your turn to show us something.
[01:25:19.320 --> 01:25:20.160]   - Thank you very much.
[01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:21.920]   - I don't know if someone's been done before.
[01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:23.360]   - What is that?
[01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:25.440]   - I hope not, it's called photo FX.
[01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:26.880]   Have you guys done this one?
[01:25:26.880 --> 01:25:28.520]   - Oh, who knows, and who cares?
[01:25:28.520 --> 01:25:30.920]   It's a photograph application for...
[01:25:30.920 --> 01:25:33.080]   I have to say, the iPhone camera's so good
[01:25:33.080 --> 01:25:36.560]   that I've become much more interested in photos software.
[01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:38.240]   - Well, I shouldn't probably even try to demo this
[01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:40.720]   by point in this, but so there's all these apps you can get
[01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:42.640]   that's like, oh, make this look like a crappy camera,
[01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:44.720]   or make me look like a hipster from Brooklyn.
[01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:46.560]   And there's all these great little, like, you know,
[01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:49.480]   make this look like a Loma or whatever, but you're fun.
[01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:52.160]   But I think sometimes if you wanna get a little more serious,
[01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:53.920]   I mean, the iPhone, not that I'm not serious,
[01:25:53.920 --> 01:25:56.200]   but the iPhone 4 has such a great camera
[01:25:56.200 --> 01:25:57.800]   that you actually can...
[01:25:57.800 --> 01:25:58.640]   - I agree.
[01:25:58.640 --> 01:26:01.440]   - Like, you can actually, with a little few tweaks,
[01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:02.760]   and a little bit of cropping,
[01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:04.640]   sometimes a little bit of rotating stuff
[01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:07.240]   that's hard to do right now with the regular stock software.
[01:26:07.240 --> 01:26:08.480]   There's a whole bunch of these apps.
[01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:09.480]   I could go into millions of them.
[01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:10.480]   - Do you like photo gene?
[01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:11.640]   Have you tried photo gene?
[01:26:11.640 --> 01:26:12.960]   - I like that one.
[01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:13.800]   - I don't think I have.
[01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:16.080]   - That's another one that's got the same kind of, you know.
[01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:18.600]   - Okay, well, this is a really, I like this one a lot.
[01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:20.800]   It's called photo FX.
[01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:22.320]   - Spill it for me, would you?
[01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:23.160]   - Yeah, sure.
[01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:25.880]   It's a P-H-O-T-O space FX.
[01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:31.120]   And, you know, this, and to be honest, Photoshop Express
[01:26:31.120 --> 01:26:33.720]   are two of my go-tos for just doing a little quickie things.
[01:26:33.720 --> 01:26:34.800]   - Oh, we have done this before.
[01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:36.800]   This is the Tiffin app, yeah.
[01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:38.400]   - This has a nice, we have done it well.
[01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:41.600]   - Yeah, well, no, it's worth mentioning again, absolutely.
[01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:43.680]   - Yeah, we know one thing that's tough about the iPhone,
[01:26:43.680 --> 01:26:45.560]   obviously, is the size of the display.
[01:26:45.560 --> 01:26:48.800]   It's hard to, you know, it's really easy to over sharpen,
[01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:49.960]   everything gets a little crispy,
[01:26:49.960 --> 01:26:51.560]   but it's got some nice subtle effects,
[01:26:51.560 --> 01:26:53.640]   and like, I don't know what all these trademarks mean,
[01:26:53.640 --> 01:26:55.200]   but they've got like a lot of, like,
[01:26:55.200 --> 01:26:57.760]   what Steve Martin would call a gel.
[01:26:57.760 --> 01:27:00.680]   They've got these like, Alex, what do you call that?
[01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:01.640]   When you got a copyrighted,
[01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:03.200]   make this yellow, more yellow filter?
[01:27:03.200 --> 01:27:04.040]   What's that called?
[01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:04.880]   - Sepia?
[01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:05.840]   - No, no, no.
[01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:07.400]   - No, but there's like, I'll look it up here.
[01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:09.640]   But anyhow, there's one page you get the pretty basic stuff.
[01:27:09.640 --> 01:27:12.000]   Like, go in and like, let me help me sharpen this.
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:13.320]   Fix the temperature, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh,
[01:27:13.320 --> 01:27:15.160]   do auto auto auto. - This does look great.
[01:27:15.160 --> 01:27:16.360]   - It's got a lot of like,
[01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:18.720]   once you're comfortable with using the app,
[01:27:18.720 --> 01:27:20.360]   and again, this is not fun.
[01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:21.520]   - I'm getting just right now.
[01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:22.720]   - A watermark, is that what you're talking about?
[01:27:22.720 --> 01:27:23.560]   Watermarker top, is it?
[01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:24.640]   - No, I'll get it right here.
[01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:26.240]   There's some stuff in here that I just
[01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:27.400]   is ridiculous and I don't touch.
[01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:28.240]   These lighting effects,
[01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:29.400]   if you want it to look like basically
[01:27:29.400 --> 01:27:31.960]   the set of dark shadows or something, you can do that.
[01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:33.960]   But stuff like light balancing
[01:27:33.960 --> 01:27:35.880]   here under the photographic section.
[01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:37.760]   Yeah, deep yellow, you can,
[01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:40.240]   this correct warmth and coolness better
[01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:41.600]   than any app that I've seen.
[01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:43.000]   - Yeah, the guys who write this,
[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:44.800]   just the guys who write this also,
[01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:47.320]   well, it's written by the same guys who write
[01:27:47.320 --> 01:27:49.800]   Silhouette effects, which is the de-roto-scoping tool
[01:27:49.800 --> 01:27:51.040]   for the film industry.
[01:27:51.040 --> 01:27:52.560]   I mean, these guys know,
[01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:54.720]   they know film and film effects
[01:27:54.720 --> 01:27:56.800]   and the math behind this.
[01:27:56.800 --> 01:27:59.160]   I mean, it's not like this is some little guy
[01:27:59.160 --> 01:28:02.040]   that thought I'd look up some tricks for photos.
[01:28:02.040 --> 01:28:03.760]   I mean, these guys really know what they're doing
[01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:05.240]   and then they're making it simple
[01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:06.080]   and making it available.
[01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:07.080]   So it's-- - I'm buying it right now.
[01:28:07.080 --> 01:28:08.440]   - And it's a variety of things you can do,
[01:28:08.440 --> 01:28:10.440]   just so you know, this is not just for nerds.
[01:28:10.440 --> 01:28:12.320]   You can go in and there's like this auto adjust section
[01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:13.840]   can hardly be simply go to auto adjust
[01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:15.600]   and then you want to auto color, auto contrast
[01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:16.400]   or auto whatever.
[01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:17.840]   Now my eyes are not that great.
[01:28:17.840 --> 01:28:20.040]   I keep my brightness down low to save my battery.
[01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:21.640]   So other people will actually probably get more
[01:28:21.640 --> 01:28:22.560]   out of this than me.
[01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:25.200]   But if you've got a decent photo to start with,
[01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:26.640]   it's just real fast to go in
[01:28:26.640 --> 01:28:29.200]   and make little fixes with this.
[01:28:29.200 --> 01:28:30.880]   I think they have this for the iPad.
[01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:31.720]   Wait, no, I'm sorry.
[01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:35.400]   I think it's just an iPhone app that'll run on your iPad.
[01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:37.160]   But if they could come up, and this could be like
[01:28:37.160 --> 01:28:38.840]   your Photoshop basically, I think.
[01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:40.720]   Anyway, photo, I know it's short on time.
[01:28:40.720 --> 01:28:42.920]   Photo effects, I like it a lot.
[01:28:42.920 --> 01:28:45.080]   - Do you Instagram, Merlin?
[01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:48.080]   - You know, I played with it.
[01:28:48.080 --> 01:28:49.320]   I'm already like so sick of that.
[01:28:49.320 --> 01:28:51.760]   I'm just-- - You're over it.
[01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:54.440]   - I made a crack on the Twitter about yesterday.
[01:28:54.440 --> 01:28:58.160]   I think I said it was the missing ironic mustache
[01:28:58.160 --> 01:28:59.160]   for your iPhone.
[01:28:59.160 --> 01:29:02.480]   You know, it's so like Williamsburg hipster to me.
[01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:05.200]   Like, oh, look at this, it's blue now.
[01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:07.320]   Okay, it's fun for a while, but it's like me
[01:29:07.320 --> 01:29:08.840]   with the slow-sink flash.
[01:29:08.840 --> 01:29:10.280]   Like, I way ever did that for a year
[01:29:10.280 --> 01:29:12.120]   until people wanted to punch me in the throat.
[01:29:12.120 --> 01:29:15.760]   I think those fun makeup photo jazzy things
[01:29:15.760 --> 01:29:18.240]   are fun for a while, but let's be honest,
[01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:19.640]   you're gonna be bummed in five years
[01:29:19.640 --> 01:29:21.600]   when all your photos look like they fell into it,
[01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:23.360]   like blue ink, you know?
[01:29:23.360 --> 01:29:27.760]   Or you've added all this noise to these photos, you know?
[01:29:27.760 --> 01:29:28.880]   But it's fun, whatever.
[01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:31.240]   - I like the social aspect of it, but--
[01:29:31.240 --> 01:29:32.760]   - Yeah, I don't like social aspects of anything.
[01:29:32.760 --> 01:29:34.920]   - Yeah, I know, you're really pretty much anti-socialist.
[01:29:34.920 --> 01:29:36.440]   - I have friends, I don't need a computer.
[01:29:36.440 --> 01:29:37.280]   - No, I don't have friends.
[01:29:37.280 --> 01:29:38.920]   See, there's the difference between you and me.
[01:29:38.920 --> 01:29:39.760]   - Oh, no, anyway--
[01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:41.680]   - You guys are my friends.
[01:29:41.680 --> 01:29:43.200]   - I have lots of apps like this, Leo,
[01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:44.600]   but I like photo effects a lot.
[01:29:44.600 --> 01:29:48.040]   I also like that liquid scale, Photoshop Express,
[01:29:48.040 --> 01:29:50.760]   Camera Bag, Photo Rotate does one thing.
[01:29:50.760 --> 01:29:52.240]   Rotate photos.
[01:29:52.240 --> 01:29:54.000]   No color, still awesome.
[01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.040]   - I just got the thing that happens when,
[01:29:56.040 --> 01:29:59.080]   that's kind of like a nice little thing that happens
[01:29:59.080 --> 01:30:00.200]   when I downloaded it and said,
[01:30:00.200 --> 01:30:02.040]   oh, you've already bought this app, would you like--
[01:30:02.040 --> 01:30:04.080]   - I get that five, though.
[01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:05.120]   - I love that feeling.
[01:30:05.120 --> 01:30:06.680]   I'm afraid that that happens to me once in a week.
[01:30:06.680 --> 01:30:09.240]   - It's not gonna cost me anything, I guess I have it.
[01:30:09.240 --> 01:30:10.680]   But I just took it off for some reason.
[01:30:10.680 --> 01:30:12.840]   So anyway, I'm putting it back on.
[01:30:12.840 --> 01:30:14.760]   Thank you, Merlin, man, Andy, Innaco,
[01:30:14.760 --> 01:30:16.200]   your pick of the week, sir.
[01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:18.080]   - I just looked at myself on the monitor thinking,
[01:30:18.080 --> 01:30:21.160]   I look like a field reporter that on election night
[01:30:21.160 --> 01:30:24.400]   is like sent out to like stand in front of a school building.
[01:30:24.400 --> 01:30:25.280]   - Yeah, was there a storm?
[01:30:25.280 --> 01:30:26.120]   What happened?
[01:30:26.120 --> 01:30:26.960]   Why is it so dark?
[01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:28.320]   - Yeah, exactly, we're really like,
[01:30:28.320 --> 01:30:29.880]   when we started, it was bright and summer.
[01:30:29.880 --> 01:30:31.680]   - It's been a long-time show.
[01:30:31.680 --> 01:30:33.160]   - It's been a long-time show.
[01:30:33.160 --> 01:30:35.680]   - We've been here so long, it's dark now.
[01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:37.040]   - The house isn't even there anymore.
[01:30:37.040 --> 01:30:38.440]   It's been hundreds of years.
[01:30:38.440 --> 01:30:39.280]   - Is it evening?
[01:30:39.280 --> 01:30:41.400]   Is that what happened to the sunset?
[01:30:41.400 --> 01:30:45.360]   - Well, because the Earth is actually an oblites spheroid
[01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:48.800]   that's on an offset access to the rotation to the sun,
[01:30:48.800 --> 01:30:50.280]   it's called a suborbital anime.
[01:30:50.280 --> 01:30:52.280]   - That's wild.
[01:30:52.280 --> 01:30:53.920]   So it's actually just dark yet.
[01:30:53.920 --> 01:30:54.760]   - It's not, well--
[01:30:54.760 --> 01:30:56.200]   - Yeah, exactly, it gets light for well,
[01:30:56.200 --> 01:30:57.120]   then it gets dark for well.
[01:30:57.120 --> 01:30:58.200]   - Daylight savings.
[01:30:58.200 --> 01:30:59.520]   - Yeah.
[01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:03.400]   - Just behold, your future, and three hours,
[01:31:03.400 --> 01:31:07.400]   it should be a talk of still, a fun year.
[01:31:07.400 --> 01:31:08.240]   Be aware.
[01:31:08.240 --> 01:31:11.360]   Okay, quick recommendation.
[01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:13.960]   And a timely one, since we're talking so much about
[01:31:13.960 --> 01:31:17.680]   having like 80, 50 Giggillion walk,
[01:31:17.680 --> 01:31:21.880]   Giggillion by storage devices,
[01:31:21.880 --> 01:31:23.920]   is Corellia Immediate Browser.
[01:31:23.920 --> 01:31:28.360]   It's a free media browser app that will just simply,
[01:31:28.360 --> 01:31:31.400]   anytime you're looking for media on your drive,
[01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:34.200]   be it music, be it photos, be it movies,
[01:31:34.200 --> 01:31:36.800]   it is the best way to find the thing you're looking for,
[01:31:36.800 --> 01:31:39.520]   because if you are clever, then yes,
[01:31:39.520 --> 01:31:41.680]   you use incredibly good nomenclature
[01:31:41.680 --> 01:31:43.880]   so that you can immediately figure out,
[01:31:43.880 --> 01:31:46.400]   I want the picture of Swan Boats
[01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:49.400]   and Boston Public Garden with the kid
[01:31:49.400 --> 01:31:51.840]   on the Memorial Bridge above,
[01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:53.960]   but without the graffiti on the pile,
[01:31:53.960 --> 01:31:55.520]   as you're behind it, and then you simply
[01:31:55.520 --> 01:31:58.080]   looks through a spotlight search and you find it.
[01:31:58.080 --> 01:31:59.160]   For the rest of us though,
[01:31:59.160 --> 01:32:00.560]   you just simply have to look
[01:32:00.560 --> 01:32:02.880]   before until you find the photo that you want.
[01:32:02.880 --> 01:32:05.080]   And so what it does is it collects all of your,
[01:32:05.080 --> 01:32:07.840]   it will essentially throw out your entire drive
[01:32:07.840 --> 01:32:10.120]   for all of your photos, all of your audio,
[01:32:10.120 --> 01:32:13.560]   all of your movies and all of your Safari links.
[01:32:13.560 --> 01:32:15.440]   No matter where they are in photos,
[01:32:15.440 --> 01:32:17.520]   it can look inside your eye photo library,
[01:32:17.520 --> 01:32:20.600]   your aperture library, inside your pictures folder anywhere.
[01:32:20.600 --> 01:32:22.280]   And so I often use it when I know
[01:32:22.280 --> 01:32:25.280]   that I've got a certain picture somewhere on that drive.
[01:32:25.280 --> 01:32:27.120]   The only way to find it is simply
[01:32:27.120 --> 01:32:29.160]   to add a little bit of the image,
[01:32:29.160 --> 01:32:31.120]   you can just click on the picture,
[01:32:31.120 --> 01:32:33.040]   you can just click on the picture,
[01:32:33.040 --> 01:32:34.440]   you can just click on the picture,
[01:32:34.440 --> 01:32:36.080]   you can just click on the picture,
[01:32:36.080 --> 01:32:37.440]   you can just click on the picture,
[01:32:37.440 --> 01:32:39.040]   you can just click on the picture,
[01:32:39.040 --> 01:32:40.480]   you can just click on the picture,
[01:32:40.480 --> 01:32:42.040]   you can just click on the picture,
[01:32:42.040 --> 01:32:43.880]   you can just click on the picture,
[01:32:43.880 --> 01:32:45.520]   you can just click on the picture,
[01:32:45.520 --> 01:32:47.320]   you can just click on the picture,
[01:32:47.320 --> 01:32:48.920]   you can just click on the picture,
[01:32:48.920 --> 01:32:50.280]   you can just click on the picture,
[01:32:50.280 --> 01:32:51.720]   you can just click on the picture,
[01:32:51.720 --> 01:32:52.560]   you can just click on the picture,
[01:32:52.560 --> 01:32:53.560]   you can just click on the picture,
[01:32:53.560 --> 01:32:54.920]   you can just click on the picture,
[01:32:54.920 --> 01:32:55.920]   you can just click on the picture,
[01:32:55.920 --> 01:32:59.680]   the good news is that it actually is an application,
[01:32:59.680 --> 01:33:02.280]   articulation of a whole media browser engine
[01:33:02.280 --> 01:33:04.360]   that Correa with a lot of help
[01:33:04.360 --> 01:33:06.320]   from a lot of different programmers are building.
[01:33:06.320 --> 01:33:08.760]   And this media browser is starting to pop up
[01:33:08.760 --> 01:33:10.440]   in a lot of third party apps,
[01:33:10.440 --> 01:33:12.440]   just like if you're using iMovie
[01:33:12.440 --> 01:33:14.480]   and you want to grab a photo from iPhoto,
[01:33:14.480 --> 01:33:16.320]   there's a standard Apple media browser
[01:33:16.320 --> 01:33:17.520]   that pops up inside there
[01:33:17.520 --> 01:33:19.400]   or in GarageBand or any pretty else.
[01:33:19.400 --> 01:33:22.040]   The idea of this media browser is to give that kind
[01:33:22.040 --> 01:33:23.960]   of functionality to third party app.
[01:33:23.960 --> 01:33:26.120]   So if you're in Mars at it
[01:33:26.120 --> 01:33:28.880]   and you want to embed a picture inside a blog post,
[01:33:28.880 --> 01:33:31.320]   the end that they use for browsing
[01:33:31.320 --> 01:33:32.520]   is in fine end of the picture you want
[01:33:32.520 --> 01:33:35.200]   and embedding it is exactly this browser itself.
[01:33:35.200 --> 01:33:36.820]   So it's free, free, free, free, free,
[01:33:36.820 --> 01:33:38.560]   it's one of those things that you just toss
[01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:40.840]   in your startup applications list.
[01:33:40.840 --> 01:33:42.160]   And then the moment that you need it,
[01:33:42.160 --> 01:33:44.480]   tab over to it and you'll grab what you want in 30 seconds
[01:33:44.480 --> 01:33:45.800]   is really, really, very, very,
[01:33:45.800 --> 01:33:48.560]   it's likely done app also a very Mac-like app.
[01:33:48.560 --> 01:33:49.840]   It's very, very pretty, very, very,
[01:33:49.840 --> 01:33:51.880]   it's like, "Correaia of Corsa Guide is launch bar
[01:33:51.880 --> 01:33:53.640]   "is a great designer.
[01:33:53.640 --> 01:33:54.640]   "Nice-looking apps."
[01:33:54.640 --> 01:33:58.080]   It's a box, they do a lot of really, very pretty apps.
[01:33:58.080 --> 01:33:59.280]   You see even on the Mac side,
[01:33:59.280 --> 01:34:00.760]   you're starting to see a lot of people
[01:34:00.760 --> 01:34:03.400]   who are sort of succumbing to the disease of,
[01:34:03.400 --> 01:34:05.840]   "I can either sit and think for four hours
[01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:07.200]   "or I can just put in a menu
[01:34:07.200 --> 01:34:08.880]   "or I can just put another tool palette
[01:34:08.880 --> 01:34:11.040]   "or I can put another button."
[01:34:11.040 --> 01:34:12.880]   Probably usually tries to figure out,
[01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:14.520]   "No, there must be a way that we can add this feature
[01:34:14.520 --> 01:34:16.040]   "without adding complexity."
[01:34:16.040 --> 01:34:18.120]   So, well, I should, you know,
[01:34:18.120 --> 01:34:19.680]   a secondary plug for Sandbox,
[01:34:19.680 --> 01:34:20.520]   which you briefly mentioned,
[01:34:20.520 --> 01:34:23.360]   it's a web design software that's pretty high powered,
[01:34:23.360 --> 01:34:24.880]   pretty interesting.
[01:34:24.880 --> 01:34:25.960]   - Well, the recount is gonna go,
[01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:28.280]   at least into midnight, we're told to,
[01:34:28.280 --> 01:34:29.920]   but we'll be here until,
[01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:30.960]   until two candidates,
[01:34:30.960 --> 01:34:33.440]   sides until back to the news of 11.
[01:34:33.440 --> 01:34:35.440]   - Or Andy and I are coming in the dark.
[01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:37.280]   - Hello, Andy!
[01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:39.280]   You can stay there in Indianapolis
[01:34:39.280 --> 01:34:40.760]   for a little longer, can't you?
[01:34:40.760 --> 01:34:43.320]   That's a good question,
[01:34:43.320 --> 01:34:45.760]   but the independent candidates really got too drunk
[01:34:45.760 --> 01:34:47.560]   to get out of the truck,
[01:34:47.560 --> 01:34:50.960]   and as a result, was not able to get that last second canvassing.
[01:34:50.960 --> 01:34:52.000]   We don't know how that's gonna affect
[01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:53.480]   riding candidates back to UTET.
[01:34:53.480 --> 01:34:56.000]   - Andy and Iko is at the celestial waste of bandwidth,
[01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.520]   and the Chicago Sun-Times always a pleasure.
[01:34:58.520 --> 01:34:59.640]   Thanks for joining us today.
[01:34:59.640 --> 01:35:01.800]   Andy, Merlin Mann is the man
[01:35:01.800 --> 01:35:04.360]   at You Look Nice Today, a great podcast.
[01:35:04.360 --> 01:35:05.320]   - We're getting early indications
[01:35:05.320 --> 01:35:06.960]   that Alan Jones from the sensible party
[01:35:06.960 --> 01:35:08.480]   is turning out just slightly ahead
[01:35:08.480 --> 01:35:11.360]   of Kevin Phillips-Pong from the slightly silly party.
[01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:13.520]   - I like it, they're Merlin's on the light side,
[01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:14.920]   and Andy's on the dark side.
[01:35:14.920 --> 01:35:18.880]   You guys are like duct tape, it's good, I like it.
[01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:20.400]   We should do this from now on.
[01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:22.240]   One person will be dark, one person will be light.
[01:35:22.240 --> 01:35:23.200]   - Thank you for having me on,
[01:35:23.200 --> 01:35:24.400]   thank you for another lovely episode.
[01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:27.000]   - We adore you, Merlin, thank you for being here.
[01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:31.000]   Merlin Mann.com, M-E-R-L-I-N-M-A-N-N.com.
[01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:32.320]   - And there is a You Look Nice Today,
[01:35:32.320 --> 01:35:33.320]   a new one that happens together.
[01:35:33.320 --> 01:35:34.320]   - A new one.
[01:35:34.320 --> 01:35:37.400]   - But it's not for the first time listener.
[01:35:37.400 --> 01:35:39.440]   - Oh, you know, it's not very long.
[01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:40.800]   I think you could make it through it.
[01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:43.160]   There's certainly a lot of things related
[01:35:43.160 --> 01:35:45.240]   to the parts of the body where a child comes out,
[01:35:45.240 --> 01:35:47.000]   and I think that's fun for everybody.
[01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:48.560]   - Oh yeah, it's great fun for everybody.
[01:35:48.560 --> 01:35:49.640]   - There's Chang and Eng, look at that.
[01:35:49.640 --> 01:35:52.360]   - Chang and Eng, the original Siamese twins.
[01:35:52.360 --> 01:35:54.500]   - Call them attached Asians now, that's the
[01:35:54.500 --> 01:35:55.820]   (laughing)
[01:35:55.820 --> 01:35:58.080]   - It's more politically correct, absolutely.
[01:35:58.080 --> 01:36:01.120]   Alex Lindsey is at thepixelcorpixcorps.com
[01:36:01.120 --> 01:36:03.600]   for his multimedia guild of artists.
[01:36:03.600 --> 01:36:05.920]   - We seriously geeked out over the weekend,
[01:36:05.920 --> 01:36:09.080]   so there'll be some gear media texts that are from AES,
[01:36:09.080 --> 01:36:11.080]   the Audio Engineering Society.
[01:36:11.080 --> 01:36:11.920]   - Oh, that'll be fun.
[01:36:11.920 --> 01:36:12.760]   - Yeah, yeah, so we show,
[01:36:12.760 --> 01:36:15.680]   and I filled up my ear with Goo to get a custom.
[01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:16.600]   - I've done that.
[01:36:16.600 --> 01:36:18.240]   - And we have a show title.
[01:36:18.240 --> 01:36:21.080]   The best part is when they, well, it's like a tampon
[01:36:21.080 --> 01:36:22.320]   through your ear, they put a little string
[01:36:22.320 --> 01:36:23.160]   that comes out of it.
[01:36:23.160 --> 01:36:24.160]   - Yeah, they put it all too far.
[01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:26.000]   - I literally thought he was gonna put it into my jaw.
[01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:27.720]   - Oh, then it goes very deep, well it has to.
[01:36:27.720 --> 01:36:30.280]   And then after it dries, you have to sit like this for a while.
[01:36:30.280 --> 01:36:31.760]   - Yeah, no, no, you didn't have to do that.
[01:36:31.760 --> 01:36:32.920]   - Oh, you didn't have to let it dry?
[01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:34.960]   - The big syringe in his room.
[01:36:34.960 --> 01:36:37.480]   - Yeah, and then mine, they had to let dry,
[01:36:37.480 --> 01:36:39.600]   so we sit like this, and then they have a string on it,
[01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:41.520]   and they pull it out and it goes (blows raspberry)
[01:36:41.520 --> 01:36:43.800]   It's about the loudest sucking sound you've ever heard.
[01:36:43.800 --> 01:36:46.840]   - I have a great photo in my flicker feet at Macroklexpo,
[01:36:46.840 --> 01:36:49.080]   someone having that stuff like injected into his ear.
[01:36:49.080 --> 01:36:49.920]   - Oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:36:49.920 --> 01:36:51.280]   - And the expression on is in a case
[01:36:51.280 --> 01:36:52.920]   that he was not expecting that sensation.
[01:36:52.920 --> 01:36:53.760]   - Yeah, no.
[01:36:53.760 --> 01:36:56.240]   - You know, I usually feel stuff on your ear drum.
[01:36:56.240 --> 01:36:57.720]   That's a new sensation.
[01:36:57.720 --> 01:36:58.760]   - Yeah, it was a little odd.
[01:36:58.760 --> 01:37:01.480]   - Anyway, but, and I, yeah, that's it.
[01:37:01.480 --> 01:37:02.320]   - So it was coming up.
[01:37:02.320 --> 01:37:04.440]   GMT is at pixelcore.tv.
[01:37:04.440 --> 01:37:05.280]   - Yes.
[01:37:05.280 --> 01:37:06.200]   - That's where the podcasts live.
[01:37:06.200 --> 01:37:08.040]   I'm Leo LaPorte, we do this show, well, we stay,
[01:37:08.040 --> 01:37:09.480]   you know what?
[01:37:09.480 --> 01:37:12.880]   Tune in at 11, Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern time.
[01:37:12.880 --> 01:37:15.360]   19 out of UTC for the pre-show.
[01:37:15.360 --> 01:37:17.320]   And then roughly half an hour to an hour later,
[01:37:17.320 --> 01:37:19.720]   we'll actually get into content when we're good and ready.
[01:37:19.720 --> 01:37:22.000]   But I think that the frankly, the pre-show is now
[01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:23.680]   my favorite part of Macbreak Weekly.
[01:37:23.680 --> 01:37:24.520]   It is a lot of fun.
[01:37:24.520 --> 01:37:26.440]   - It's the part we throw out oddly enough.
[01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:27.600]   I think we need to keep it.
[01:37:27.600 --> 01:37:30.120]   It's kind of like artichokes.
[01:37:30.120 --> 01:37:30.960]   I think we need a pre-show.
[01:37:30.960 --> 01:37:31.800]   I think we need to keep it.
[01:37:31.800 --> 01:37:32.800]   - This is the heart, but we throw out the leaves.
[01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:34.080]   And I think the leaves are good.
[01:37:34.080 --> 01:37:34.920]   - Yeah.
[01:37:34.920 --> 01:37:36.720]   - It's the next day, anything that's left over
[01:37:36.720 --> 01:37:39.440]   becomes a part of a hardy's chef specials too.
[01:37:39.440 --> 01:37:40.840]   - You got it.
[01:37:40.840 --> 01:37:42.760]   - Not the least bit tanked, it's a little off,
[01:37:42.760 --> 01:37:44.400]   but it's not, you know, people.
[01:37:44.400 --> 01:37:46.560]   - My people ruin every part of the buffalo.
[01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:49.360]   (laughing)
[01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:50.560]   - Well, did you get the link?
[01:37:50.560 --> 01:37:52.680]   I sent Tom Zollar's live over on Twitter.
[01:37:52.680 --> 01:37:54.440]   He's listening to us live.
[01:37:54.440 --> 01:37:57.120]   Drew us a cartoon of Colonel Peck.
[01:37:57.120 --> 01:37:57.960]   - Oh.
[01:37:57.960 --> 01:38:00.320]   - Wow, already before we--
[01:38:00.320 --> 01:38:02.800]   - The link is in the B.W. Ronda document.
[01:38:02.800 --> 01:38:04.240]   - Oh, let me pull that back up.
[01:38:04.240 --> 01:38:06.080]   I'd closed it prematurely, apparently.
[01:38:06.080 --> 01:38:06.920]   Let me see.
[01:38:06.920 --> 01:38:09.320]   - It's at the bottom underneath the place of the week.
[01:38:09.320 --> 01:38:11.440]   - It was. (laughing)
[01:38:11.440 --> 01:38:13.120]   - You see, the danger though is that,
[01:38:13.120 --> 01:38:14.480]   like, already we're going along,
[01:38:14.480 --> 01:38:16.600]   but we could like, if we know that so that artists
[01:38:16.600 --> 01:38:18.320]   are listening, we could do stuff like that,
[01:38:18.320 --> 01:38:20.720]   we can sort of turn this into a vegan-pro-chowling.
[01:38:20.720 --> 01:38:22.040]   - We can go as long as you want.
[01:38:22.040 --> 01:38:23.800]   - The problem with Steve Jobs said,
[01:38:23.800 --> 01:38:26.240]   it's kind of like he's in a Yeti costume
[01:38:26.240 --> 01:38:27.800]   on the Millennium Falcon,
[01:38:27.800 --> 01:38:29.280]   spraying a banana plant.
[01:38:29.280 --> 01:38:30.120]   - Stop it, Andy. - Stop it.
[01:38:30.120 --> 01:38:30.960]   - Stop it. - Stop it.
[01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:31.800]   - I love it.
[01:38:31.800 --> 01:38:33.120]   - That is so cool.
[01:38:33.120 --> 01:38:34.880]   - Tom Zollar, loveincapes.com.
[01:38:34.880 --> 01:38:36.000]   That is Colonel Panic.
[01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:37.720]   And he does seem a little panicked right there.
[01:38:37.720 --> 01:38:39.160]   - He's got to kind of go over it and solve it
[01:38:39.160 --> 01:38:40.520]   and feel that I like a lot.
[01:38:40.520 --> 01:38:42.240]   - He's the very model of a modern.
[01:38:42.240 --> 01:38:43.480]   - I'm a modern Colonel Panic.
[01:38:43.480 --> 01:38:44.960]   - That's very cool.
[01:38:44.960 --> 01:38:46.320]   Thank you for doing that so much.
[01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:47.760]   That is awesome. - That's just a job time.
[01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:48.680]   - Thank you all for being here.
[01:38:48.680 --> 01:38:49.960]   We'll see you next time.
[01:38:49.960 --> 01:38:54.200]   Oh, by the way, that 11 a.m., all that thing, 2 p.m.,
[01:38:54.200 --> 01:38:56.600]   1900 UTC, that's on Tuesdays.
[01:38:56.600 --> 01:38:59.040]   Just so you know, at live.twit.tv.
[01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:02.720]   But you can also subscribe, twit.tv/mbwmloport.
[01:39:02.720 --> 01:39:04.440]   Have a great day, great week.
[01:39:04.440 --> 01:39:06.160]   We'll see you next week right here.
[01:39:06.160 --> 01:39:08.400]   Now get back to work, break time is over.
[01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:10.960]   Says Colonel Panic.
[01:39:10.960 --> 01:39:11.960]   - No!
[01:39:11.960 --> 01:39:13.040]   - How would he say that?
[01:39:13.040 --> 01:39:14.320]   - No, I need to be...
[01:39:14.320 --> 01:39:15.320]   - The pants, bros.
[01:39:15.320 --> 01:39:16.320]   - I won't go to heaven.
[01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:17.160]   - They lie to me.
[01:39:17.160 --> 01:39:19.000]   - You're gonna take time as hell.
[01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:20.160]   - I'm saving us.
[01:39:20.160 --> 01:39:21.600]   - You're gonna be right, chef.
[01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:22.800]   - Oh, gosh, chop me.
[01:39:22.800 --> 01:39:23.800]   - I'm gonna chop it.
[01:39:23.800 --> 01:39:24.640]   - I'm gonna chop it.
[01:39:24.640 --> 01:39:27.840]   - I got a pee like a horse.
[01:39:27.840 --> 01:39:28.680]   - Yeah.
[01:39:28.680 --> 01:39:30.000]   - Ah, boys.
[01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:30.840]   - Little pit.
[01:39:30.840 --> 01:39:33.420]   (upbeat music)
[01:39:33.420 --> 01:39:36.000]   (upbeat music)
[01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.740]   (dramatic music)
