[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.540]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly.
[00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:08.160]   Apple is open sourcing home kit and getting together with Google and Amazon for a new IOT standard.
[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.220]   Has... has heck freezing over?
[00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:16.680]   Walt Mossberg looks back at a decade of Apple and why do my AirPods smell like blueberries?
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.180]   It's all coming up next.
[00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.580]   Our last Mac Break Weekly of 2019.
[00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.820]   Podcasts You Love
[00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.820]   From People You Trust
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.320]   This is Detroit.
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.160]   This is Mac Break Weekly.
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.720]   Episode 693 recorded Monday, December 23rd, 2019.
[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.720]   Happy Festivus!
[00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:47.320]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show we cover the latest Mac and Toss news.
[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.120]   And this is the last show of 2019.
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.520]   Which usually means there's nothing to talk about.
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.320]   Actually, there's a surprisingly a lot of stuff to talk about.
[00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.320]   Let's say hello to I'm Moors.
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.720]   Like you go either way, couldn't it?
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.720]   Alright, I'm Moors Renee Ritchie.
[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.920]   I'm Moors Renee Ritchie from Vector.
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.720]   I'm where.com/vector and Montreal.
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:09.720]   Hello Renee.
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.320]   Oh, you've got the new Apple TV screen savers, the underwater screen saver running on your TV back there.
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.320]   Isn't that pretty?
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.320]   Yeah, I needed some jellyfish because it's beginning to look a lot like Christmas here Leo.
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.320]   Everywhere I go.
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.320]   Little tropics.
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.320]   Ah, is it snowing out there?
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.320]   It's not snowing right now, but we have snow.
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.320]   The ground is covered in snow and ice.
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.320]   Well, good news.
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.320]   Your colleague at I'm Moors, Lori Gill, managing editor there, has cookies.
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.320]   Yeah.
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.320]   And cookies for everyone.
[00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.320]   Look at this.
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.320]   She brought cookies.
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.320]   Wow, lots of cookies.
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.320]   I love the plate.
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.320]   All different kind of cookies.
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.320]   Wow, that looks good.
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.320]   Oh man.
[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.320]   Happy holidays.
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.320]   Candy cane headband.
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.320]   And you've adjusted your shot.
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.320]   I like it so that the candy can spit.
[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.320]   My candy canes are straight, but my wall is crooked.
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.320]   So you guys figured out.
[00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.320]   Something's distorted.
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.320]   Hello, Lori.
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.320]   Hi.
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.320]   Also joining us, he's wearing his Star Wars shirt in honor of...
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:08.320]   In honor of just it being a cool shirt and by not wearing it as much as I would like.
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.320]   Do you believe it's the 42nd anniversary?
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.320]   It took 42 years to complete the Triple Trilogy.
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.320]   The first three trilogies.
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.320]   Yeah.
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.320]   Yeah.
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.320]   Well, some might say they've hardly completed it, but this is no special.
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.320]   But this is no spoilers.
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.320]   So, I mean, that's Annie and I go by the way.
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.320]   That's the Star Wars guy.
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.320]   Yeah, the Star Wars guy.
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.320]   Yeah, I haven't seen it yet.
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.320]   We're going to go see it Christmas Eve.
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.320]   Carson is not seeing it till his birthday on the 29th.
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.320]   So no spoilers on this show.
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.320]   No spoilers.
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.320]   I did love it though.
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.320]   I'm not going to spoil it, but I did love it.
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.320]   I watched last night.
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.320]   Maybe he seemed salty about it.
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.320]   Laurie loved it too.
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:56.320]   I have a very strong opinion that if you like Star Wars movies, then you don't even get
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.320]   my opinion until after you've seen it.
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.320]   So I'm giving them a mouth shut.
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.320]   Oh, all right.
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.320]   I won't even tell you whether I like your mind.
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.320]   I have to say, I re-watched the last Jedi just to get up to date.
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.320]   And I'm glad I did because I forgot a lot of it.
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.320]   It was a whole two years ago, right?
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.320]   So I forgot a lot of it.
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.320]   Now you can watch the pitch meetings.
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.320]   Leo, I was sending those to Laurie.
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.320]   It's a guy who plays himself against a green screen, pitching it as the writer and the producer.
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.320]   And they just bring out everything that's wrong with it, but in the most hilarious way possible.
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:29.320]   And all of them, even like the good ones, like Empire and like Star Wars are hilarious.
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:30.320]   Oh, I'll watch it if you have time.
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.320]   Yeah, which by the way, all of his are good.
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:34.320]   He doesn't just do Star Wars.
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.320]   He does a bunch of different movies and he is hilarious.
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.320]   I gotta check that guy's stuff.
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.320]   I can't play anything from YouTube ever again.
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.320]   That's true.
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.320]   Is it the screen rant pitch meetings?
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.320]   Yes.
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.320]   I can't play it.
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.320]   I played something from YouTube on our holiday special, Twit.
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.320]   And they pulled it down.
[00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.320]   So we had to re-edit it.
[00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.320]   Because the problem is it's fair use.
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.320]   It's commentary on something.
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.320]   And so I know it's completely legal.
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.320]   It's copyright safe because it's fair use.
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:12.320]   But the process to appeal to take so long, it doesn't matter after ten weeks we get it back up.
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:17.320]   But by then, the show is so dated, we've lost all the views anyway.
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:23.320]   So this is the chilling effect of copyright law and takedowns on YouTube.
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.320]   So I will no longer be showing, right, Carson?
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.320]   We just shouldn't show anything.
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.320]   Yeah.
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.320]   No clips of anything.
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:31.320]   Carson had a work late last night.
[00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.320]   It was really sad.
[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.320]   Because he had to edit it out.
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.320]   And Kevin had to come in and edit it out.
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:42.320]   No.
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.320]   The permanent truth is that moderation of content is not scalable.
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.320]   And so whoever runs this service is always going to do whatever answer is.
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.320]   Put gets into the least amount of trouble and costs the least amount of effort.
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:03.320]   And so my difficulty is that all these content companies understand that there's probably very, very little chance that someone
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.320]   is reversing a content strike.
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.320]   So you may as well just automatically strike everything.
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:18.320]   And now you get situations where like if I create a viral video or any type of content and then CBS News
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:26.320]   like does, hey, today in tech, and they like quote, they run like five seconds of it, then the automatic content moderator at CBS will
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.320]   content claim my stuff.
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:28.320]   Right.
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:33.320]   I can say that the stuff they stole it from is now theirs and now I have to fight to get my monetization back.
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:38.320]   Yeah, we got content claimed on something starring Leo.
[00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.320]   Really?
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:40.320]   Yes.
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:41.320]   It was a G4 clip.
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.320]   Oh, that's right.
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.320]   It was it was in it.
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.320]   But it was that didn't.
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:45.320]   Yeah.
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:46.320]   Patrick, it was me and Patrick Norton.
[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:47.320]   But it didn't.
[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:52.320]   I forget the guy's name, but he went and added his theme song to iTunes using CD Baby.
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.320]   And now whenever a video is claimed, he claims it as well.
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:59.320]   And that way it stays up and he gets part of the revenue while he's fighting it.
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.960]   Oh, maybe that's a word, but apparently it works.
[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.320]   I should go counterclaim the G4 clip.
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:05.320]   Yep.
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:06.320]   Yeah.
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:07.320]   Because I'm in it.
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:08.320]   Yep.
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:09.320]   Oh, that's a good idea.
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:10.320]   Yep.
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:11.320]   This sounds terrible.
[00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:12.320]   I don't like this.
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:13.320]   I quit.
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.320]   I quit.
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:15.320]   I don't like the world.
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.320]   So basically I quit.
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:22.320]   We, you know, even though this show, the entire premise of all the shows we do into it, we don't do any original journalism.
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:25.480]   It's commentary on other people's work.
[00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:27.000]   That's the nature of what we're doing.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.640]   It's a commentary show.
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:34.160]   So, you know, I guess ultimately we'd have no show at all if we cut out everything we're
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.360]   talking about.
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.960]   But fortunately that hasn't per, you know, propagated past YouTube.
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.560]   So we just won't show anymore.
[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.320]   Clips or music or anything fun.
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.320]   And a YouTube one job.
[00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:48.320]   Ah, humbug.
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:49.320]   I do.
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:55.320]   I do have to say I broke down and ordered AirPods Pro because of this article.
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:58.040]   And, and it's not going to come for a month.
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.880]   There's still a month out.
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:01.880]   Stephen Kowai.
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:02.880]   Some stores are getting them in stock.
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.080]   If you, if you find a local store, you might have some in stock.
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:06.080]   Okay.
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.080]   That's, that's always a good tip.
[00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:08.080]   All right.
[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:09.080]   So I ordered them on the Apple site.
[00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:10.080]   But yeah, yeah.
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:11.280]   I ordered them engraved.
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:17.320]   I always engraved my AirPods because not for any vanity purposes, but just so easy to lose.
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.920]   Or so easy to borrow.
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:22.640]   Micah, whose AirPods are those easy to borrow?
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:28.920]   So it says Leo LePort's iPod's hands off.
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:33.000]   But these pros, so this is Stephen Koyle who published an article on his blog.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:40.520]   And actually I should, I should show his blog talking about AirPods Pro Bluetooth latency.
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:43.960]   So explain to me what, what, why latency is even an issue?
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:45.560]   What is that even?
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:46.560]   What are we talking about?
[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.040]   It depends on who you are.
[00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:51.520]   So for example, if you're, the biggest example is accessibility.
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:57.080]   If you're using these for voiceover or any kind of work that requires us to be your whole
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:01.120]   world and there's a latency involved and that is incredibly disturbing sometimes to
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.440]   the point where it's not usable for you.
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:08.280]   And that's why a lot of people had apprehension around the original AirPods also for gaming.
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:09.280]   You know, you want.
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.680]   Bluetooth has inherently because it's a radio technology.
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:12.680]   Some built in latency.
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:13.680]   Yeah.
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:16.840]   So it's slightly off from when it should be synced up.
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:19.480]   So that matters if you're playing a game.
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:20.480]   Yep.
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:24.360]   Because the pew pew will come just slightly after you fire the gun.
[00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:28.040]   If you're typing and there's key clicks, there's a lot of things you might do where
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:32.640]   that latency, if you notice it, could be just disturbing.
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:35.120]   But it mostly matters if you're a music producer, right?
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:38.800]   Which I think I gather Koyle is because that's, if you do, especially if you're doing live
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:43.160]   performance, the synchronization is kind of critical.
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:48.840]   I have never met anybody who records audio that uses Bluetooth headphones that's unheard
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:49.840]   of.
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:53.360]   They're always plugged in, which is really annoying when you're recording music and
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:57.760]   you're wearing headphones that have a 20 foot cord.
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:02.760]   So I like the idea of being able to use Bluetooth because that would be amazing to have to
[00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:06.080]   be not wired to the soundboard.
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:11.880]   He used some pretty sophisticated tools to measure latency and came up with some really
[00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:13.520]   encouraging result.
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:18.600]   Now the far right bar, if you're looking at the video, is just a speaker connected to
[00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:19.600]   the device.
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.760]   And even that has something like 70 milliseconds of latency.
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:25.680]   It's not zero.
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:29.120]   And I think you can notice latency of 15 or 20 milliseconds.
[00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:31.840]   So it might even be noticeable to you.
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:33.440]   But look at the AirPods 1.
[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:38.200]   They had latency from 274 milliseconds.
[00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:42.240]   The AirPods 2.1 generation went to 178 milliseconds.
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:45.640]   The AirPods Pro 144 milliseconds.
[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:52.720]   And that's significantly better than Beats Studio 3 or the Sony WH-CH700N.
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:57.000]   In fact, the only thing beating it is a directly connected device speaker.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.080]   So for Bluetooth headphones, that's quite good.
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:04.680]   Although you're right, Laurie, you still wouldn't want to mix or record, I guess, would be more
[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:08.240]   important with Bluetooth headphones on of any kind.
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.720]   Is that H1 chip, Leo?
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:11.720]   It's the H.
[00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:12.720]   Now it's the H.
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:14.560]   It's the H, not the W now, is the H.
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:17.040]   The W moved to Apple Watch and became the Apple Watch.
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.200]   The W2 became the Apple Watch's wireless chip.
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.400]   And they made a dedicated H series.
[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:23.560]   And the H1 is the first one.
[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:27.080]   It's got eight audio cores, but the AirPods Pro is the only one that's using all eight
[00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:28.920]   of them so far.
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:33.600]   So that convinced me I should probably get the AirPods Pro.
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.320]   I know you guys love them.
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:36.560]   That fits better, right?
[00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:37.560]   We're in them right now.
[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:39.960]   And the noise cancellation's good.
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:46.200]   I don't think they're probably sound wise as good as some higher-end headphones, but...
[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:51.600]   No, they still suffer from a little bit of the, you know, just too tinny, too high-end
[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:52.600]   sounding.
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:57.680]   But they're absolutely fantastic for everyday use, especially for conversations like this.
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:59.880]   Like Renee and I, we wear them all the time.
[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:00.880]   Wow.
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:01.880]   They're so comfortable.
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:06.000]   I just cannot believe how much more comfortable they are than the AirPods.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.480]   And just in general, how much more comfortable they are than any earbuds I've ever used.
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:14.680]   It's kind of amazing how comfortable they are.
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:18.680]   And I do also wear them when I'm walking down the street.
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:24.160]   I will switch to my PowerBeats Pro when I want to focus on music because this is just
[00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:25.160]   a better sound.
[00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:26.440]   It has a deeper, warm sound.
[00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:31.760]   But if I'm listening to podcasts or audiobooks or even just casually listening to music and
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:35.960]   not really trying to focus in on the music, all the other AirPods for that.
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:36.960]   Yeah.
[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:37.960]   Yeah.
[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:42.200]   Somebody's mentioning the Bose QuietComfort 35 Mark II.
[00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:46.000]   I use the QC35s on airplanes because of the noise cancellation.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.480]   They're similar in the air, but they're wired.
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:52.680]   And he says on the QC35 II, I guess they are not wired.
[00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:53.680]   They're Bluetooth.
[00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:56.320]   The delay is a killer when he watches TV.
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:57.640]   You can really notice it.
[00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:58.640]   So yeah.
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:11:59.640]   Yeah.
[00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:04.440]   But coil makes an app, a music rhythm app called TAPT.
[00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:08.920]   So that's part of the reason why he cares a lot about this because you're tapping to
[00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:09.920]   test your rhythm.
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:13.040]   So any latency is going to make it harder to play.
[00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:15.400]   Well, that's good news.
[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:18.200]   I thought I'd start with some good news.
[00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:20.240]   There's other news.
[00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:22.760]   This is also, I think, good news, but I'd love to know what you think.
[00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:26.200]   This broke the day after the show last week.
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:33.320]   And I stunned me, Apple, Google, and Amazon got together with the Zigbee Alliance to create
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:40.080]   Project Chip, the connected home over IP, an open standard.
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:45.000]   The last thing I would ever thought for home automation.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.920]   So even though Apple, Google, and Amazon are kind of deeply in competition in this space,
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:54.160]   I think they decided it would be better for everybody if stuff interoperated.
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:55.960]   It's a cool acronym.
[00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:58.360]   You got to use a cool acronym if you can come up with one.
[00:12:58.360 --> 00:12:59.360]   Yeah.
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:02.920]   Well, what is also great is Z-Wave then responded by doing the same thing.
[00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:06.480]   They said, well, okay, we'll open our technology as well.
[00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:07.880]   So is it a brave new world?
[00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:12.600]   Is it a bold new horizon for home automation?
[00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:14.760]   Is this going to transform everything?
[00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:21.600]   Yeah, I'd say so because we go into each other's homes and we see that everyone's using smart
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:24.480]   bulbs and smart appliances and smart devices.
[00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:30.080]   But it hasn't penetrated quite so well with the people who are just, they just want a
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:32.240]   light bulb or they just want a speaker.
[00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:33.720]   They just want something to work.
[00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:36.400]   And part of it is because, well, first you have to set up this hub and then you have
[00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:37.720]   to set up this phone app.
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:40.200]   And then you have to make sure that you've got these all in the same network.
[00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:43.480]   And then you've got to make sure that these are actually compatible with each other.
[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:46.640]   Oh, wait, you bought the wrong kind of plug adapter, better return those and look for
[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:49.120]   kinds that have these kind of certifications on them.
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:52.840]   The ability for one device to talk directly to another device will just simply say, if
[00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:59.080]   this has got this, just look for the Underwriters Laboratory logo on it, you know that you're
[00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:00.680]   safe, you know that you're good.
[00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:06.160]   So yeah, it's a case of them chasing after people that they still have their money in
[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:11.200]   their pockets, but they haven't actually given them to a maker of home automation products
[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:12.200]   yet.
[00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:13.200]   Yeah.
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:16.640]   Well, and I may not be as sanguine as you about the future of it just because you've
[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:22.520]   got, as with any industry consortium trying to work on a unified standard, you're going
[00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:25.880]   to have all these companies come in and say, well, no, you can't do that or you can't
[00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:26.880]   do that.
[00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:28.280]   But they couldn't use Apple's logo.
[00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:30.040]   He has fake version of Apple's logo.
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:31.480]   Yeah, can't do that.
[00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:36.320]   That's that doesn't bode well for eventual, you know, comity.
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:40.760]   However, on the other hand, there's a lot of economic pressure to do this because right
[00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:44.200]   now you go to buy a lock, a smart lock.
[00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:47.280]   And the first thing you got to figure out is this is going to work with my Google device
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:49.520]   or my Echo or is it going to work with my home pod?
[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:51.000]   What is it going to work with?
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.680]   And that's not a good consumer experience.
[00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:56.520]   So I think there's a lot of pressure to do this.
[00:14:56.520 --> 00:15:00.560]   It'll also open up competition and opportunities for people who just writing software to run
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:01.720]   all these sort of things.
[00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:06.080]   Which is what terrifies Apple when Google and Amazon, they don't know a lot of other
[00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:07.080]   people involved.
[00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:11.120]   But I was also, I was also reading the spec and trying to answer the question for myself,
[00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:17.800]   how many opportunities does this create for some for a company, let's say like Facebook
[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:23.280]   that would like to see what I want to map your entire house and see exactly what devices
[00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:28.520]   are everywhere without having to implement eight or nine or 10 or 11 different protocols.
[00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:30.320]   So yeah, it would be really.
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:32.080]   Oh, Andy, you just creeped me out.
[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:33.840]   I know I'm just breaking everything in my house.
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:34.840]   Thank you.
[00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:39.840]   It's a consumer dream though to be able to say I can decide which of these assistants
[00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:44.880]   and voice things I want to use and everything in my house will work with it is awesome.
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:46.440]   And mix and match them and mix and match.
[00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:50.680]   Yeah, because you don't want to just say, oh, well, and that's why I think I'm a little
[00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:55.840]   suspect because I mean the whole point for Google at this point was, yeah, you have to
[00:15:55.840 --> 00:16:01.320]   buy all Google devices and then they'll all work together or Apple or Amazon.
[00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:05.040]   I think I think it was more along the lines of this, the only way to get all these things
[00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:06.040]   to work together.
[00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:07.040]   Right.
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:12.440]   And it's but not to downplay Google buying an entire company just to make sure they could
[00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:17.440]   sell everything in one package, but really if you want to provide a service to the, to
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:21.320]   your customers and they're not going to return it in two weeks because they still haven't
[00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:22.800]   gotten everything working together.
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:26.760]   It's easier if you say, well, just have your, have your nest speaker talk to your nest
[00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:30.320]   thermostat in reaction to your nest doorbell going off.
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:31.720]   So that's what it's doing.
[00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:34.080]   I put Google Home Hubs everywhere, Nest Home Hubs.
[00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:37.120]   I changed my ring doorbell for a hello doorbell.
[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:38.120]   It all works nicely.
[00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:39.280]   Somebody rings my doorbell.
[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:43.840]   My home hub puts a, immediately puts a picture up on the screen of who's at the doorbell.
[00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:48.600]   And if it recognizes them, if it has face recognition built in and it recognizes them,
[00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:51.000]   they'll say, you know, Michael's at the front door.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.440]   And it tells me announces it out loud.
[00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:54.440]   I love that.
[00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:56.440]   I think that's a, all of that is great.
[00:16:56.440 --> 00:17:02.560]   And I would love that's, that's exactly what doesn't work for a lot of the average consumers.
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:05.400]   They have to tie all the same stuff and they don't know that.
[00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:09.200]   So they, they buy different brands and they don't understand why that's working.
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:14.560]   And this is an opportunity to correct that mistake and let the average consumer have
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:19.280]   that same experience that you're having, that we're having with all of our connected stuff,
[00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:24.320]   without having to be, you know, IT people, because there's, you know, a lot of people
[00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:27.600]   who don't understand what does it mean to be home kit compatible?
[00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:31.240]   What does it mean to be a Lexi compatible or, or Amazon compatible?
[00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:38.160]   So this is a, it's a good opportunity to equalize the equal, the playing field and let everyone
[00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:39.160]   participate.
[00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:44.120]   But I, you know, Andy's comment does kind of freak me out a little bit.
[00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:47.360]   It's like, who gets their hands on this data?
[00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:50.760]   Well, Laurie, everybody does.
[00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:52.760]   It's an alliance.
[00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:55.400]   I don't, I've done that.
[00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:59.360]   Information must be free, Laurie.
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:01.360]   I'm trying to hide what you're doing.
[00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:05.880]   And everybody, not like there's a variety of how Terry and governments who just love to
[00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:07.720]   interrogate you when they based off of your social company.
[00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:09.480]   We're going to get to that in a second.
[00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:13.160]   But first, Apple says they're going to, as part of this chip alliance, they're going
[00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:15.400]   to open source parts of home kit.
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:16.400]   Yeah.
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:18.000]   That's, that, there's the opportunity.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   I want, I want more home kit compatible devices.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.800]   So I like this idea a lot.
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:23.800]   Right.
[00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:24.800]   And everyone else was buying all of them.
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:28.800]   Like Apple hasn't really bought anybody, but goog, between Google and Amazon and Samsung,
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:31.760]   they bought up most of the big brands in the industry.
[00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:35.280]   And they were not exactly prioritizing home kit compatibility as one of their roadmaps.
[00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:36.920]   Well, maybe that's Apple's incentive.
[00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:42.240]   Isn't it always the case that the guy who's laggard is behind when windows was dominant,
[00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:46.600]   Max had to make sure that they worked with, you know, Windows stuff.
[00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:49.960]   When you're not the dominant player in the industry, you don't, you know, you try to
[00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:51.320]   work with the other folks.
[00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:53.800]   So maybe that's one of Apple's incentives.
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:54.800]   Yeah.
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:58.840]   So even I, I have my ear to the ground as much as anybody else.
[00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:02.400]   And even I'm occasionally confused as to what Apple means by home kit.
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:06.200]   When they, when Apple points at something and calls this home kit, I turn and I don't
[00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:07.560]   know what I'm going to see.
[00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:12.080]   So it's a, it's a good saving rule for, for Apple definitely.
[00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:13.560]   What?
[00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:20.120]   So did I ask this last week, why does an Apple have a device with a screen?
[00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:21.920]   Amazon and Google both do.
[00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:22.920]   They're missing so many.
[00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:26.840]   Like they don't have a, yeah, they don't have a mini home pod.
[00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:30.480]   They don't have their own locks and how they don't, they're a privacy focus company.
[00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:31.840]   They don't have their own router.
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:34.920]   Like the one of the most important connections in your house and they stopped making them.
[00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:36.840]   So it's, it all thing is flabbergasting to me.
[00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:37.840]   Yeah.
[00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:38.840]   I'll, I'll say it again.
[00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:43.040]   The one, the, one of the best moves Apple could make is to get into create a, create a,
[00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:48.440]   a home security camera or a home monitor camera, create all that stuff where as much as some
[00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:53.960]   people like myself trust with a lowercase T, trust Google, if Apple created a camera,
[00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:56.720]   oh boy, would I immediately take off all these nest cameras?
[00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:57.720]   Okay.
[00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:01.480]   My one nest camera, but replace it with an Apple camera.
[00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:05.520]   So you were mentioning spy apps.
[00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:11.040]   Turns out that there is an app that millions have downloaded called to talk, not tick
[00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:14.160]   talk, T-O-T-O-K.
[00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:24.360]   It's a messaging app that has built in video and voice calling, a New York Times investigation
[00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:31.320]   as well as a intelligence assessment from the US intelligence community discovered that
[00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:34.120]   it's actually a spy tool.
[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:40.680]   It's used by a government, the United Arab Emirates and can track every conversation,
[00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:46.080]   every movement, every relationship, every appointment, every sound, every image of people
[00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:47.800]   who installed on their phones.
[00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:52.640]   It was only put out a few months ago, millions of downloads on the Apple and Google app stores,
[00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:56.720]   not just by people in the UAE, but by people all over the world.
[00:20:56.720 --> 00:21:02.280]   I'm sure that if this is the, if the UAE created it was with that intent, it was really to
[00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:05.840]   spy on people in the UAE as opposed to people in the US.
[00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:06.840]   But who knows?
[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:12.000]   It was one of the most downloaded social apps in the US last week.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.320]   Apple has pulled it off the app store, so has Google.
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:21.360]   Talk about stuff you don't want in your house, Laurie.
[00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:26.440]   But then pulling that off the app store doesn't actually get it off people's phones though,
[00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:27.440]   right?
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:31.000]   So the message needs to be sent out to everyone who downloaded it too.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   Yeah.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.200]   Yeah, that's kind of scary.
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:40.480]   Every time a new social service comes out, that's kind of the fear that you walk into
[00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:42.800]   is this something I can trust.
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:48.320]   And a lot of times it's fine and there's nobody in the background trying to steal any
[00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:52.840]   information, even though you have to give access to a keyboard or you have to allow them to
[00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:54.400]   use your camera or something like that.
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:59.520]   But when something like this comes up, it definitely scares me and reminds me that we're
[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:08.400]   giving away a lot when we even to known services that are not nefarious, like that they have
[00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:12.120]   the ability to access that as soon as we agree to it.
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:16.480]   And they're not using it, but it was to say that that's not going to change someday.
[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:22.720]   That's where I have a lot of that kind of fear, that future fear of big brother watching
[00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:27.360]   of like right now they're not doing it, but they can do it because we gave them permission
[00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:30.280]   to because we had to in order to use it.
[00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:34.280]   There was this chilling video this week too of someone in China being interrogated, like
[00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:38.800]   basically change to this giant metal bathtub overcoat thing.
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:42.600]   And they were saying, why did you complain about the police taking motorcycles?
[00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:43.600]   We saw you on WeChat.
[00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:44.840]   We know that you complained about it.
[00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:45.840]   And he's like, oh, I'm drunk.
[00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:46.840]   He was drunk as your excuse.
[00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:47.840]   You should apologize.
[00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:51.160]   And they had his entire everything about him and they knew everything where he was, when
[00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:54.800]   he was, and he had to like tape an apology to everybody.
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:58.160]   And it was just, we're all just a couple steps away from that.
[00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:01.120]   And you never really know what's going to happen until it does.
[00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:02.120]   Yeah.
[00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:06.640]   And these are all going to become more of national politics issues.
[00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:11.360]   Department of Defense just last week advised everybody in the Department of Defense.
[00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:14.520]   If you have the TikTok app installed on your phone, remove it right now.
[00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:16.400]   And if you haven't removed it, install it yet.
[00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:22.080]   Don't don't install it in the future because there's still security agencies are still
[00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:25.760]   trying to figure out is this is TikTok really a piece of spyware?
[00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:31.200]   Is there anything is a Chinese government using it as a potential surveillance tool or
[00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:36.960]   is it just simply a potential that because it's an app on a phone, just like any country
[00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:41.800]   could put any country's programmers could write any app for any phone, you could use
[00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:48.560]   that to figure out where people are moving, where users are located, how they're moving.
[00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:49.960]   And this is not about China.
[00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:51.480]   This is not about Turkey.
[00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:52.640]   It's not about specific countries.
[00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:56.280]   This is a threat to pretty much any citizen who has a phone in their pocket.
[00:23:56.280 --> 00:24:01.000]   If we New York Times did that wonderful piece that excuse me, first part of a series of
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:06.200]   articles a few days ago that really just explained that you don't need to have a totalitarian
[00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:12.120]   government that is infecting every phone with a piece of mandatory government created spyware,
[00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:17.640]   you can just simply buy information from people from companies that are legally scraping it
[00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:19.640]   from all of our movements.
[00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:25.520]   They decided to see how far they could track just individuals, people in the military,
[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:29.840]   people in people who work in Washington, people who work in government, and they're
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:34.840]   just leaving so many bread crumbs behind simply by virtue of the fact that like everybody
[00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:38.440]   you have a phone with you, that it's ridiculous.
[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:48.400]   It's not really, I don't fear if the totalness of the danger is not by malicious governments.
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:53.360]   It really is by industries and companies that have absolutely no laws preventing them from
[00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:55.000]   doing whatever they want to do.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:02.200]   We've got a warning about the Canadian border because they've granted America absolute rights
[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:03.200]   inside of Canada.
[00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:06.760]   If you're in an airport, you can no longer decide not to go to America.
[00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:07.760]   You can no longer leave.
[00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:08.760]   They can arrest you.
[00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:09.760]   They can detain you.
[00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:11.360]   They can go through your Twitter, go through your Facebook.
[00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:16.480]   There's like low-key panic about just crossing into the US border now, which used to be the
[00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:19.720]   friendliest, longest, most unprotected border in the world.
[00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:20.720]   I got a saying though.
[00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:21.720]   I got a saying though.
[00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:23.600]   Going into Canada has always been tough.
[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:26.480]   So it goes both ways.
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:27.800]   But you used to be able to leave.
[00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:30.960]   If you were an American, you were going into Canada or vice versa.
[00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:31.960]   You could say, "I changed my mind.
[00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:33.960]   I'm not going in and they had to let you go."
[00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:36.480]   That's apparently no longer true.
[00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:38.920]   Here's another scary point of information.
[00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:42.000]   According to the New York Times, they hired Patrick Wardle, who's great.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:47.320]   In fact, remember that name because my pick of the week this week comes from Patrick Wardle.
[00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:49.640]   He's a former NSA hacker.
[00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:53.720]   He's a private security researcher, also writes great Mac software.
[00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:55.880]   He did a forensic analysis of Toot-Tock.
[00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:56.880]   Guess what?
[00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:04.480]   It's basically a copy of a Chinese messaging app called Yee-Call, slightly customized
[00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:06.080]   for English and Arabic audiences.
[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:08.680]   They didn't even have to write a custom app.
[00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:14.800]   They could take an existing app offered by a Chinese company, modify it slightly, and
[00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:16.560]   put it out.
[00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:20.040]   I wonder, can you still download Yee-Call?
[00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:22.040]   This is a really interesting issue.
[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:26.640]   We are carrying in our pockets with our smartphones an amazing surveillance device.
[00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:34.200]   If you look at the cybernetics, the Toot-Tock collected, it's everything.
[00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:40.520]   I keep trying to figure out ways in which I can get by throughout the days, particularly
[00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:49.440]   if I'm not outside, if I'm leaving my house, and not have my phone actually turned on.
[00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:56.080]   I've been thinking about for other reasons buying a lossless MP3 player, a lossless digital
[00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:58.640]   audio player, for a lot of reasons.
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:00.160]   But now that's another reason.
[00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:06.200]   If I had a separate device that doesn't have Wi-Fi, doesn't have Bluetooth, doesn't have
[00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:12.360]   cellular chip, and it's just there to play 200 gigabytes of my music, that means that
[00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:17.240]   if I'm really going all over the place today, I can turn off my phone and only turn it back
[00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:21.640]   on again when I'm at a really big public place.
[00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:28.080]   It's hard to come up with an opinion that doesn't sound, A) doesn't sound completely
[00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:33.920]   paranoid, and B) isn't actually a really smart thing to think about because it really is
[00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:34.920]   that bad.
[00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:40.600]   Again, I say with no regulations whatsoever, no one will ever go to jail for tracking the
[00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:44.120]   vice president via his phone, no matter where he goes.
[00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:49.000]   It is the responsibility of the people around him to shut down cell servers and shut down
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   cell towers.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.800]   And even then, all you have to do is have someone with a Wi-Fi.
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:58.520]   There's no laws against doing whatever you want with whatever you can get throughout
[00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:00.320]   the air, and that is terrible.
[00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:05.080]   There is one positive note on this story, which is that this is a relatively recent
[00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:07.800]   app and they got caught right away.
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:11.160]   And I think that that points to the fact that people are much more aware than they used
[00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:16.280]   to be, and there are a lot of people looking at apps to see what Zex infiltrated.
[00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:20.280]   And so it's encouraging to me that they got caught.
[00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:23.440]   But the TikTok adoption rate was astronomical.
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:25.560]   But we don't even really talk about it.
[00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:26.560]   TikTok.
[00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:27.560]   Yeah.
[00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:28.560]   But TikTok.
[00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:30.560]   TikTok is a phenomenal people.
[00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:33.000]   I had that discussion until much later.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:38.560]   I got to presume that Patrick Wardle and others in the CIA are paying attention to TikTok
[00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:43.920]   as well, and if it exfiltrated all that information that we would know about it.
[00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:48.920]   By the way, ByteDance, the parent company, is looking for headquarters outside of China
[00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:50.920]   because of this scrutiny.
[00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:54.200]   They don't want to be perceived as a Chinese company.
[00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:58.560]   So they still will be, and they still would be behodened to China, but they'd like to
[00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:01.560]   move their world headquarters out of China, I guess.
[00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:08.440]   Imagine how frustrated the Attorney General's office and law enforcement in the United States
[00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:13.000]   are, where they're having to fight, fight, fight tooth and nail and have this multi-year
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:18.920]   long strategy, just to have the ability to request through a court access to encrypted
[00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:20.280]   data on a phone.
[00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:24.400]   And meanwhile, they see across the ocean, here are governments that are actually putting
[00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:26.360]   regular surveillance apps into play.
[00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:29.840]   Here are governments that are actually putting requirements that you have to have this app
[00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:30.840]   installed.
[00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:37.720]   You can't have new rules that say that if you buy a phone within our territorial borders,
[00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:40.840]   it has to come pre-installed with Russian made apps.
[00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:46.720]   And it's like, but we know this person is doing evil things and hurting people.
[00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:52.080]   We have his phone, and you're telling me that we can't get into the encrypted contents
[00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:53.080]   of this.
[00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:59.880]   Meanwhile, this is why they want that kind of power, because it really is powerful stuff,
[00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:04.240]   whether it is, whether you are on the side of the angels, again, trying to keep people
[00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:08.040]   safe and solve horrifying crimes.
[00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:10.480]   Or if you are just simply saying, "Hey, you know what?
[00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:16.160]   It would really make things easier for us if everybody was required to use an app that
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:20.840]   tracks their location and looks at everything that they type in with the keyboard for certain
[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:24.600]   key phrases and sends transcripts to us on a minute-by-minute basis.
[00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:26.840]   Wouldn't that be convenient for us?"
[00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:33.160]   There's been a lot of criticism of Elon Musk's planned launch 12,000 satellites.
[00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:34.160]   Yeah, Jesus.
[00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:39.640]   It's an up to over 40,000 total.
[00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:43.440]   Yeah, and he's got approval for the first 12 stars.
[00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:46.240]   He's already launched 160.
[00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:51.560]   This is part of his attempt to wire the world, global internet via Starlink.
[00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:52.560]   He's not alone.
[00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:54.680]   Jeff Bezos is doing the same thing.
[00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:57.360]   And maybe Apple is planning something similar.
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:02.880]   Mark Gurman's story in Bloomberg, Apple has secret team working on satellites to beam
[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:06.720]   data to devices.
[00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:12.800]   I'm not sure Mark's interpreting the information correctly.
[00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:16.600]   Apple, he says, has about a dozen engineers from the aerospace satellite and antenna design
[00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:20.560]   industries working on the project with the goal of deploying the results within five
[00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:21.560]   years.
[00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:25.600]   I'm wondering, though, if Apple's planning on launching satellites, which he seems to
[00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:31.000]   imply, or they just want to be ready when Starlink and Jeff Bezos' effort and other
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:38.240]   efforts come to fruition so that their phones can be satellite ready.
[00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:39.640]   I don't know what to make of this.
[00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:42.880]   It's such an inefficient way to get data to a phone.
[00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:45.440]   We're talking about the latency of just simply Bluetooth headphones.
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:49.160]   Now think about the latency of a signal that has to go from a base station up to a satellite,
[00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:50.880]   then down to a phone again.
[00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:56.120]   There's a reason why Starlink's latency, according to Musk, is very low because they're low Earth
[00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:57.120]   orbit.
[00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:59.800]   They're not as far as all that.
[00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:04.120]   I think he was claiming latency comparable to terrestrial internet.
[00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:07.640]   He's also saying that we could just get everywhere by digging tunnels and putting their cars
[00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:08.640]   on rails.
[00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:10.880]   He's ruined his credibility, I understand.
[00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:15.960]   And then it's also a problem of you can't just keep throwing huge constellations of
[00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:17.160]   satellites in orbit.
[00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:18.920]   You can't do that.
[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:22.560]   There's already a problem where I'm trying to remember the details.
[00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:29.080]   Earlier this year, there was a traffic problem with one of his test satellites that it was
[00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:30.920]   about to collide with another satellite.
[00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:43.360]   One of them said, because a traffic email between some military board to the Starlink
[00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:49.840]   people running that desk was ignored or mis-filed or sent somebody's inbox, it didn't go somewhere,
[00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:53.000]   you almost had a major collision.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:57.840]   And this has been prompting a desire to say, we need to have some sort of automated traffic
[00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:01.680]   control system, or at least some sort of a system that could automatically negotiate
[00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:05.440]   between two different constellations to say, no, you get out of the way, no, you get out
[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:06.760]   of the way, no, I have the right of way.
[00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:09.880]   So you're going to have to weigh some of your propellant in order to move.
[00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:15.040]   Well Musk is claiming on the Starlink site that they have autonomous collision avoidance.
[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:21.120]   They're using DOD tracking to autonomously maneuver to avoid collisions.
[00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:22.120]   It's not autopilot?
[00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:23.120]   Yeah.
[00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:28.360]   Practically with space debris and other spacecraft, it's too bad that Elon has kind of heard his
[00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:33.560]   credibility long term because you have to take everything now that they say with a grain
[00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:34.560]   of salt.
[00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:38.560]   But that's clearly something that would have to be solved if you're going to have what
[00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:42.920]   would triple the number of satellites in orbit over the next few years.
[00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:46.800]   But nevertheless, he's got FCC approval to launch the first 12,000.
[00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:48.280]   He says he's going to do it.
[00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:51.840]   It'll be operational in 2021.
[00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:55.200]   And so it would make sense for Apple if this thing's going to be up there.
[00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:58.720]   You know, you'd need a specialized receiver would be sensible for Apple to start looking
[00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:00.560]   at, well, what do you need to put into an iPhone?
[00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:03.240]   Everybody to put up satellites wouldn't even let everybody put copper.
[00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:05.080]   We allowed copper monopolies.
[00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:07.320]   Everybody just throw up any satellites they want.
[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:08.320]   So far, yes.
[00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:09.320]   Yeah.
[00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:12.480]   I mean, it's it's it's always starts.
[00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:14.440]   It's always open.
[00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:15.440]   They regulated.
[00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:16.440]   Yeah.
[00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:18.320]   There was that Chris, because I've video about how we put enough stuff in space.
[00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:21.280]   We theoretically just lock ourselves in here because you can never leave orbit without being
[00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:23.440]   shot by a billion particles.
[00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:24.440]   Yeah.
[00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:28.680]   It's also he's also promising that we're going to we're going to come up with a new sort
[00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:33.360]   of anti reflective coding because now all these objects in the air contaminating view
[00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:36.600]   of astronomical astro, nom, medical.
[00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:37.600]   I'm sorry.
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:40.120]   I'm a I've been speaking way too much today.
[00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:41.920]   Astronomical viewings.
[00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:44.360]   It's again, it's a it's a not a it's not a trivial thing.
[00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:48.400]   And I don't think it's something where just because just because I'm a crazy billionaire,
[00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:52.760]   I can put satellites in orbit in that kind of quantity without coordinating with all the
[00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:55.880]   people who are on the planet underneath them who might be affected by that.
[00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:58.280]   And who might not be able to honestly want him to do it.
[00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:04.760]   I think having gigabit internet with latency under 50 milliseconds on every corner of the
[00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:11.440]   planet is kind of transformational technology, much of the same way the internet is transformational
[00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:12.440]   technology.
[00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:17.560]   And you know, astronomers have ways of getting around it and looking around it right now.
[00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:23.000]   I was reading an article by amateur astronomer who says, you know, we typically do long exposures.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:27.640]   We'll do many overnight because we're going to get satellite trails and some of them.
[00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:33.640]   And so we do many and we throw out the ones that have big long streaks of light from satellites.
[00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:37.400]   Now, I would hope that they'd be able to still get some.
[00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:38.920]   Nevertheless, this is this is this.
[00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:39.920]   Don't you agree, Andy?
[00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:44.200]   I mean, the look at I'm being completely selfish because I would like to be able to go anywhere
[00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:47.160]   in the world and still do this show.
[00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:49.280]   I think no, I absolutely with you.
[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:54.400]   And plus it solves it addresses a lot of problems where you have parts of this country and parts
[00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:59.560]   of the world that are completely underserved by by internet access, a quality stable internet
[00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:00.560]   access.
[00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:06.720]   The problem is that I do liken it to radio transmissions.
[00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:13.640]   I do liken it to the GPS constellations where at some point the government a government
[00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:20.280]   had to step in linking in with worldwide governments to understand that, okay, you just
[00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:24.800]   because you think that you have a great idea as a company for a product that involves blasting
[00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:30.520]   out 10,000 watts of signal, well, you have to play nice with everybody else who also
[00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:32.160]   wants to use the radio spectrum.
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:35.640]   So we're going to make sure that we're everyone's compartmentalized and that you're not going
[00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:36.640]   to affect other things.
[00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:38.240]   Well, that's why I got permission.
[00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:39.800]   Well, to do the FCC.
[00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:42.800]   I mean, he's got a regulator approval.
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:43.800]   Right.
[00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:47.320]   But we've but there is no right now there is no international body that's basically saying
[00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:49.360]   no, you can't put something into an orbit.
[00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:54.520]   But what I want to say about GPS though is that GPS is we put we put this constellation
[00:36:54.520 --> 00:37:01.280]   to orbit and essentially nobody owns no one organization is really owning and profiting
[00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:02.280]   from it.
[00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:05.440]   So it really is a worldwide resource at this point.
[00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:09.560]   And so when we when you come into when you come to the point of we're going to create
[00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:13.800]   a global internet access.
[00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:19.360]   The implications for untidy things happening for other people who want to innovate and
[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:21.160]   other people who want to create.
[00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:26.280]   It makes me it makes me nervous about one big huge company deciding though we're going
[00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:32.960]   to put tens of thousands of conceivably multiple tens of thousands of objects in low earth orbit.
[00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:35.520]   Each one of us because oh, now we want to compete with Elon Musk.
[00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:39.280]   So we're going to put our own 10,000 10,000 satellite constellation.
[00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:43.760]   Well, no, we want to put our own 10,000 20,000 satellite constellation.
[00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:48.520]   And it's all basically polluting this area in which we don't have very much of it.
[00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:52.280]   It can screw up communications for everybody if it all goes wrong.
[00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:56.200]   And it really is being mitigated only by how much money somebody has to invest in this
[00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:57.200]   kind of a problem.
[00:37:57.200 --> 00:37:58.800]   I don't think it's a terrible idea.
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:03.520]   I'm just saying that especially when Elon Musk's name is attached to something he's the
[00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:08.600]   person who decided to call something autopilot when it was if you think of it as autopilot
[00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:10.880]   on these cars, it's incredibly dangerous.
[00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:12.960]   You cannot think of it as autopilot.
[00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:21.120]   It's not he I don't think he's in his in his fitted black t-shirt era of of tech stardom.
[00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:26.800]   I don't think he has he has hung on to the idea that you can't just simply say, this
[00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:27.800]   is a great idea.
[00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:28.800]   Let's break things.
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:29.800]   Let's do this.
[00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:32.960]   You have to really play nice with all the other kids in the pool.
[00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:38.960]   Renee, do you think Apple wants to launch satellites or is it what is what I mean?
[00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:40.600]   This is unclear in the german article.
[00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:46.640]   Yeah, and I believe there's been reporting on this before and maybe even by mark.
[00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:48.640]   Apple again is a billion dollar company.
[00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:51.920]   Anything that we can think of in podcasts or YouTube videos, they can put a couple million
[00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:56.400]   dollars behind this doesn't sound like a big enough team to actually be constructing
[00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:58.280]   wide scale satellite deployments.
[00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:01.760]   But it probably is one that's keeping their eye on whether they need to the technology.
[00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:02.760]   It's the same with with the car.
[00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:04.960]   Like when you look at what they do with the car, can we partner?
[00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:06.160]   What parts do we have to do ourselves?
[00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:07.600]   What's the most important part?
[00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:08.920]   Use this team down size.
[00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:10.200]   Get another team down size.
[00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:11.200]   Get another team.
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:14.520]   If we could see the sausage made before the iPhone, you probably would have never thought
[00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:18.400]   the iPhone would have come out like two different projects, people leaving, people coming in.
[00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:22.040]   And it seems like this is just very early stage to either do their own if they have to
[00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:25.760]   or like you said, Leo partnering if that turns out to be the best solution and it's actually
[00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:27.280]   a viable system.
[00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:28.280]   Lori?
[00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:36.600]   I think some of the things that Andy's talking about kind of hint to me at this idea of who
[00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:40.600]   owns that and what are they going to do with it in the future.
[00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:48.720]   So if Elon Musk populates the galaxy with a bunch of satellites and that's it.
[00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:53.120]   And the FCC says, well, there's too many now, so we're stopping here.
[00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:54.120]   Then what happens?
[00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:56.520]   Then that's one company that's in charge of that.
[00:39:56.520 --> 00:40:02.560]   And is that privatizing the global internet at that point, which I think we all, there's
[00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:07.400]   already conversation going on about regulating the internet and privatizing it and things
[00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:08.400]   like that.
[00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:14.560]   And this worldwide web that has been so open since it started is not as open as it used
[00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:15.560]   to be.
[00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:19.240]   And is this just another step in the direction of privatizing the internet, which is what
[00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:25.240]   happened with radio and television is that it used to be open and then it became privately
[00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:26.240]   owned.
[00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:30.960]   And now I can't just go start a radio station because there, it just doesn't work like
[00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:31.960]   that anymore.
[00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:40.320]   So to me, like the fear I have is that how much more, how much more locked down does the
[00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:47.120]   internet get when one corporation has just launched, you know, 30,000 satellites into
[00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:48.680]   our atmosphere.
[00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:55.920]   I would like to just point out to all you haters, that Elon Musk has released all of
[00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:57.480]   Tesla's patents.
[00:40:57.480 --> 00:41:04.720]   Yes, from day one, that was always the grand strategy of Tesla was to get everybody creating
[00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:05.720]   electric vehicles.
[00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:07.840]   And I really honored him for that.
[00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:11.480]   It's only been in the last few years, Elon's got a little nutty.
[00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:16.000]   Like I said, like I said, when a CEO moves from just the schlebe stuff they hear, she
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:21.040]   used to wear to getting expensive $1,000 fitted black t-shirts, you've got to start
[00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:26.880]   to worry because that's when they start saying, what if every dog and cat weren't just a
[00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:27.880]   dog and a cat.
[00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:32.320]   He just released all of Tesla's patents.
[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:33.320]   Thank you.
[00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:38.240]   And to speak to Carsten, I don't actually mean specifically Elon Musk.
[00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:44.680]   I mean, in general, I have, you know, a strong feeling about Bezos is launching 3000 satellites,
[00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:45.680]   right?
[00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:46.680]   Right.
[00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:50.240]   So it could, it's any single company owning it all.
[00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:52.240]   Why do you hate the future?
[00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:53.240]   Because it's scary.
[00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:56.880]   Yeah, like all of the sci-fi books are coming.
[00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:59.960]   They're not coming true, but they're leaving down that path.
[00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:01.800]   The future is here, people.
[00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:02.800]   Come on.
[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:07.280]   I just want to, well, Carsten, I know that you're enjoying that barcode tattoo that
[00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:12.120]   your corporate master has put in Visible Inc.
[00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:13.680]   Can we set up Carsten Cam?
[00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:17.960]   He's a disembodied voice, but you know, on Sunday we figured out a whole new way.
[00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:19.800]   We don't have enough inputs on this show.
[00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:22.320]   Oh, he doesn't want the Carsten Cam.
[00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:23.320]   He doesn't want it.
[00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:25.960]   I asked you, what are you hiding, Carsten?
[00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:27.600]   And when are you hiding it?
[00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:31.840]   Speaking of Amazon, and this is nothing to do with Apple, but there he is.
[00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:32.840]   Mine, yes.
[00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:33.840]   Mine, blue.
[00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:37.040]   It's not Alex Lindsey, but then that it's perfect.
[00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:40.080]   Why, why are we pretending he's Alex?
[00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:41.080]   That's what we're doing.
[00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:42.080]   Yeah.
[00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:46.480]   I think that the Morton Thiakol Corporation has requested that he not be ever his face
[00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:47.480]   be shown.
[00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:48.480]   Therefore, he can infiltrate more shows.
[00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:52.160]   Hey, I just want to point out we were speaking of Amazon.
[00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:55.720]   This hysterical story from Bloomberg today.
[00:42:55.720 --> 00:43:00.320]   You remember in the Democratic debate, if you watched it, that both Bernie Sanders and
[00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:04.680]   Elizabeth Warren trashed Amazon for not paying any taxes.
[00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:09.760]   It turns out that they may not like Amazon, but Bernie has spent more than a quarter million
[00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:14.480]   dollars on Amazon office supplies on Amazon this year.
[00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:15.480]   Elizabeth Warren, 151,000.
[00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:18.760]   Apparently they all get their office supplies.
[00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:19.760]   Even Trump has spent 37,000.
[00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:20.760]   So, in the union.
[00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:21.760]   Yeah.
[00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:23.760]   It's easy, get your office supplies.
[00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:29.360]   And then my follow up question to that is are they properly paying taxes on things that
[00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:30.360]   aren't taxed to them?
[00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:37.200]   Because in California, we have to pay taxes on purchases we make from Amazon if we weren't
[00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:39.160]   taxed by California for it.
[00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:43.640]   So, are they adhering to their own tax policies on that?
[00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:48.960]   And not too bad mouth anybody, but you know, when you stand on your soapbox, you got to
[00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:49.960]   be careful what you're saying.
[00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:52.200]   You got to be careful when you stand on a soapbox.
[00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:53.200]   I think that's very good.
[00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:58.200]   Speaking of soapboxes, Walt Mossberg, who for most of this decade had the best soapbox
[00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:02.840]   in the world at the Wall Street Journal and then the recode.
[00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:04.640]   He is back after retirement.
[00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:08.960]   He is back with an article on the Verge talking about the decade.
[00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:13.800]   The headline, Tim Cooks Apple had a great decade, but no new blockbusters.
[00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:16.120]   He does start of course with 2010.
[00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:22.680]   The iPad was announced exactly 10 years ago next month, January 2010, and it's been an
[00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:24.840]   amazing decade.
[00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:30.200]   He then talks of course about Steve Jobs passing away the next year, which was a huge
[00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:31.360]   shift.
[00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:35.200]   That's when Tim Cook became CEO.
[00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:42.640]   The MacBook Air redesign of 2010, the iPhone 4 of that year, Cook's first big all new product,
[00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:44.280]   the Apple Watch in 2015.
[00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:51.640]   I think you can safely say that it is a success today, a $5 billion dollar order business.
[00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:56.320]   AirPods, a $4 billion dollar quarter business, came out in 2016.
[00:44:56.320 --> 00:45:01.120]   Maybe also bigger than iPods now, in the spring then you'll find great numbers.
[00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:05.480]   It's always tough to quantify what is innovation versus business success.
[00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:11.280]   I don't think you can say at all that Tim Cook hasn't been anything but completely successful
[00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:12.280]   with Apple.
[00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:13.440]   There's a couple of issues there.
[00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:17.000]   One is that Tim Cook was the reason for a lot of the early successes too because of that
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   famous story.
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:21.520]   It's only Steve Jobs could make an iPad but only Tim Cook could get the manufacturer price
[00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:23.320]   down at 500 bucks.
[00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:28.040]   He was the CEO, effectively the CEO and the co-CEO because Steve Jobs wanted nothing of
[00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:30.680]   quarterly calls and things like that in the early years.
[00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:33.240]   Cook always did a lot of the tasks.
[00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:36.640]   The other thing is that a lot of the stuff gets measured to the iPhone and it's not an
[00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:38.160]   iPhone level success.
[00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:42.640]   But if you look at products in general, there's nothing that is an iPhone level success.
[00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:44.400]   That's a barometer for everybody.
[00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:48.080]   It's been a hell of a depressing decade but I would argue that the iPhone is an anomaly
[00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:52.200]   and if you throw out the best product and the worst product, there's been a lot of interesting
[00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:54.760]   stuff from a lot of companies this decade.
[00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:55.760]   There you go.
[00:45:55.760 --> 00:46:01.480]   Privacy we can't deny it has been a big and successful play for Apple in the last few
[00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:04.920]   years anyway.
[00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:09.800]   I think it depends what you call a success.
[00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:14.000]   Absolutely the Apple Watch and AirPods, both of which are Tim Cook products have been hugely
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:15.040]   successful.
[00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:19.520]   On the other hand, it was the butterfly keyboard that came out on the Tim Cook.
[00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:26.520]   I would also argue that the Apple Watch is in my opinion, of course, not being one of
[00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:31.040]   the analysts of the future or the business insiders or anything.
[00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:36.400]   But Apple Watch is the most innovative product to come out at all.
[00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:39.600]   Not for nothing else but the life-saving benefits that it has.
[00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:44.480]   When you read all these articles about people who fell off cliffs or had a heart attack
[00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:53.520]   or had a seizure and would have died or they had their Apple Watch recognize something unusual
[00:46:53.520 --> 00:47:00.320]   in their heartbeat and they got early treatment for something that their doctor never would
[00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:01.320]   have caught.
[00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:03.880]   To me, that is way more innovative than any phone.
[00:47:03.880 --> 00:47:05.720]   No phone ever saved anybody's life.
[00:47:05.720 --> 00:47:07.800]   No tablet ever saved anybody's life.
[00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:12.440]   But the Apple Watch has literally saved people's lives by just being on their wrist.
[00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:16.720]   I think there are cases of iPhones stopping bullets in people's pockets.
[00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:17.720]   I know.
[00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:20.720]   There have been some earlier.
[00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:23.360]   So I'll give you that.
[00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:24.360]   No, no, you're right.
[00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:28.040]   I think the watch is actually absolutely significant as are the AirPods.
[00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:29.800]   I think, Renee, you're right.
[00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:33.920]   You're not going to have very few companies ever have one iPhone.
[00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:38.160]   It seems so unlikely that you'd have anything even close to that successful.
[00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:42.600]   It made more money than people had oligopoly control over fossil fuel resources.
[00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:47.400]   Nevertheless, Cook has been a very good steward of the iPhone and an extremely good steward
[00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:48.880]   of Apple.
[00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:52.840]   Mossberg writes, "At the end, Apple remains what it has been for many years, the single,
[00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:56.560]   most important consumer tech hardware company."
[00:47:56.560 --> 00:47:59.600]   And maybe software too, if you look at Mac OS and iOS.
[00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:00.600]   I added that.
[00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:04.280]   A major force not only in its industry, but in society at large.
[00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:07.480]   And now it is huge and rich to boot.
[00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:10.160]   And again, credit to Mr. Cook.
[00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:14.360]   But it's still unclear if it could be anybody's favorite music provider, TV network, or news
[00:48:14.360 --> 00:48:15.360]   service.
[00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:19.320]   He's referring to Apple's move to services, I guess.
[00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:22.320]   I'm not going to bet against them on that one.
[00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:24.840]   Or if you can launch another blockbuster device.
[00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:29.520]   Well, I would say it has launched at least two, maybe three blockbuster devices in this
[00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:31.120]   decade.
[00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:32.120]   Nothing like the iPhone.
[00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:34.320]   Oh, the iPad, the Apple watch, the AirPods are all spare games.
[00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:35.320]   They're really good.
[00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:41.360]   And by the way, all three made it to Time Magazine's top 10 devices of the decade.
[00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:42.360]   So...
[00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:43.960]   And the morning show finale was amazing.
[00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:44.960]   Yeah.
[00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:45.960]   What do you think of that?
[00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:46.960]   Okay.
[00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:47.960]   Now.
[00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:48.960]   So good.
[00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:49.960]   Let's get down to the real.
[00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:50.960]   I still didn't watch it.
[00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:51.960]   Oh, we can't say anything then.
[00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:52.960]   No spoilers, but it was so good.
[00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:53.960]   Yeah.
[00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:54.960]   I still have...
[00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:57.240]   You know, to me, The Morning Show, there's something wrong with the writing.
[00:48:57.240 --> 00:48:59.240]   I mean, they're quite a great cast.
[00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:00.800]   It's beautifully shot.
[00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:03.520]   There's something to me that just didn't quite click with the writing.
[00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:08.000]   I thought, you know, if the producers of Billions, for instance, or Succession have gotten their
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.280]   hands on that material, I think they would have done a better job.
[00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:11.280]   But you're right.
[00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:14.200]   It's worth watching all nine episodes.
[00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:16.760]   Is it 10 total for the 10th episode?
[00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:17.760]   Because that...
[00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:18.760]   Yeah.
[00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:19.760]   Woo!
[00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:20.760]   Woo!
[00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:21.760]   That's really interesting.
[00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:24.200]   Because now I think that every streaming company has to...
[00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:28.960]   When they get a new series, they kind of have to get the entire season in the bag and then
[00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:30.440]   watch them all.
[00:49:30.440 --> 00:49:34.080]   Because on a show like The Mandalorian, you absolutely don't want to release them all
[00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:35.240]   in one big blob.
[00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:36.240]   You want...
[00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:39.720]   There's so many little revelations and so much strength to strength, strength week to
[00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:42.040]   week that you're going to build a week after week.
[00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:47.520]   On a show like The Morning Show, it's like there are a lot of people who checked out after
[00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:52.800]   the second or third episode, whereas if they had binge watched it, maybe they leave it running,
[00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:54.680]   maybe they wake up and suddenly wait a minute.
[00:49:54.680 --> 00:49:55.680]   I don't know which...
[00:49:55.680 --> 00:49:57.720]   What's the show that's really engrossing and wonderful at wait a minute?
[00:49:57.720 --> 00:50:00.240]   It's the show that I fell asleep to because it was so boring last night.
[00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:01.240]   Hey!
[00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:02.240]   Apple kind of split the baby.
[00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:05.440]   They released the first three episodes of the new shows.
[00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:09.040]   Enough to get you hooked and then it goes weekly.
[00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:13.640]   And I have to say, I've been looking forward to Fridays because that...
[00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:15.320]   I did kind of get hooked on The Morning Show.
[00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:17.440]   I haven't finished off for All Mankind.
[00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:18.440]   I never watched...
[00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:20.000]   No, not that it's supposed to be really good too.
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:21.800]   Like people are erupting over it on Twitter as well.
[00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:24.600]   I'm going to get back to that one now that I've finished The Morning Show.
[00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:29.800]   And unfortunately, I started The Servant, M Night Shyamalan's, and that thing is awesome.
[00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:30.800]   Oh boy.
[00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:31.800]   I've been watching that one.
[00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:32.800]   Holy...
[00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:34.800]   And there are only 30 minutes, which is kind of interesting.
[00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:35.800]   Wow.
[00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:36.800]   Yeah.
[00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:42.080]   Very short, which, you know, for sitcoms maybe, but I can't think of any dramatic show that
[00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:43.080]   happened.
[00:50:43.080 --> 00:50:44.080]   The Mandalorian, how many episodes are really short too?
[00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:45.680]   And people are wondering like, what happened?
[00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:48.760]   And I think Favreau just said each episode is as long as it needs to be.
[00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:52.800]   Why should you be an hour or 30 minutes or 22 minutes or 44 minutes?
[00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:54.040]   You don't have a network schedule.
[00:50:54.040 --> 00:50:55.680]   You don't have advertising.
[00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:57.120]   You should make it exactly as long as...
[00:50:57.120 --> 00:51:01.440]   And I love the eight episode seasons because there's just no room for the padded out episodes.
[00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:02.640]   Like there's just never a filler.
[00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:03.960]   Yeah, I kind of agree with you.
[00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:05.680]   I think Apple...
[00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:09.320]   I was a little nervous about Apple TV Plus.
[00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:14.280]   I think on Balance, they've actually done remarkably well for the first year of a new
[00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:15.840]   television service with starting from the same...
[00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:16.840]   And the variety.
[00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:17.840]   Like...
[00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:18.840]   I'm a huge...
[00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:19.840]   Like I said before, I'm a huge Disney fan.
[00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:20.840]   I love Star Wars.
[00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:21.840]   I love Marvel.
[00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:22.840]   I love all those brands.
[00:51:22.840 --> 00:51:25.440]   But if you like Star Trek and DC, they have very little for you.
[00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:26.440]   Whereas Apple is...
[00:51:26.440 --> 00:51:30.120]   Like they have everything from the servant to Dickinson to The Morning Show to For All
[00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:31.120]   Mankind.
[00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:32.720]   And I love the variety of it.
[00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:33.720]   Yeah.
[00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:34.720]   Yeah.
[00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:42.360]   Hey, speaking of Apple's success with the iPhone, Apple earned this year 66% two-thirds
[00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:46.440]   of all the profit in the smartphone market for 2019.
[00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:47.440]   Two...
[00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:48.440]   That seems down.
[00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:49.440]   That seems...
[00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:50.440]   It seems fine to me.
[00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:53.440]   Samsung number two, 17%.
[00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:56.120]   That is a huge difference.
[00:51:56.120 --> 00:51:57.200]   That's global by the way.
[00:51:57.200 --> 00:51:58.200]   That's not US only.
[00:51:58.200 --> 00:51:59.200]   I think it may be higher.
[00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:00.200]   Okay, US would be even higher.
[00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:01.200]   Yeah.
[00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:02.200]   And US would be even higher.
[00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:05.320]   Well, maybe Apple doesn't want this.
[00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:07.600]   And it took a third of the revenues.
[00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:09.720]   A third of the revenues total.
[00:52:09.720 --> 00:52:12.440]   Why do you still get the wrong lower third?
[00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:13.440]   Fix your lower third.
[00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:14.440]   Oh, I'll fix my own.
[00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:15.440]   You are not all excresee.
[00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:17.400]   Stop pretending you are.
[00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:18.400]   Go ahead, Andy.
[00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:22.600]   No, I'm saying maybe that's not something Apple wants people to know that we...
[00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:28.160]   Of all the companies making phones the entire world, we gouge and inflate our prices more
[00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:29.960]   than anybody else.
[00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:34.640]   And when we find ways to economize, we don't lower our prices at all.
[00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:37.080]   We keep all that money for ourselves.
[00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:38.520]   You are right, though, according to...
[00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:41.240]   This is data from CounterPoint because it has to be guessed.
[00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:42.240]   Apple won't say.
[00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:48.920]   But you are right, Renee, that they were at 1.0 to 80% of profits.
[00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:52.240]   But the top line on this graph is Apple.
[00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:54.080]   All the rest are clustered at the bottom.
[00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:57.960]   So the thing for me is, I totally understand Andy's point, but I would actually like other
[00:52:57.960 --> 00:53:01.640]   companies to take more of that, not for Apple to learn less, but I would love for them to
[00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:02.640]   earn more.
[00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:03.640]   I'm still mourning HT.
[00:53:03.640 --> 00:53:07.160]   There's a bunch of companies that just could never sell phones for viable amounts of money
[00:53:07.160 --> 00:53:08.160]   to still be in business.
[00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:11.160]   Well, because Apple took all the oxygen out of the atmosphere.
[00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:12.160]   But also, they cut...
[00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:13.160]   The same as the apps were.
[00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:14.160]   They would just cut...
[00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:17.080]   Like, I remember Palm once sold the central for less than cost, thinking they'd make
[00:53:17.080 --> 00:53:19.880]   it up in volume and just look at Palm today.
[00:53:19.880 --> 00:53:23.000]   I just want them all to be viable because I want to have these companies in five or
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:24.000]   ten years.
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:25.000]   Yeah.
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:30.720]   Well, it's difficult in 2019 because we are really seeing trends of people losing their
[00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:33.920]   enthusiasm for spending more than $500 on a phone.
[00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:34.920]   So it's...
[00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:38.600]   A lot of these companies, particularly a company like Samsung, that has the ability to...
[00:53:38.600 --> 00:53:43.240]   I mean, their marketing strategy is if we have nine ideas for phones, we will make
[00:53:43.240 --> 00:53:46.600]   all nine and then cancel the seven that people don't want.
[00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:47.600]   Exactly.
[00:53:47.600 --> 00:53:48.600]   Exactly.
[00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:49.600]   There are two...
[00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:51.880]   That was two that was only available in South Korea.
[00:53:51.880 --> 00:53:54.760]   That was such a bad idea that they just took them off the website.
[00:53:54.760 --> 00:53:58.160]   But yeah, it's going to get more and more difficult for companies that are not creating
[00:53:58.160 --> 00:54:00.160]   a luxury...
[00:54:00.160 --> 00:54:01.160]   A high...
[00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:05.760]   That don't have that sort of aura around their brand and don't have that sort of love
[00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:11.920]   from its consumers to continue to make really, really high profits because that's why I
[00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:17.320]   see so many great phones that cost $500, $400, even a few that cost $300 where you're
[00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:19.760]   be...
[00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:25.920]   If you're willing to forego iOS and switch to Android, you'd be hard pressed to see
[00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:28.480]   where they cut corners on at least the build quality.
[00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:30.120]   Okay, definitely the camera.
[00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:35.360]   But for a lot of people, it's a $300 camera, $300 phone that they can afford, they can
[00:54:35.360 --> 00:54:39.680]   make with one payment as opposed to an $800, $900 phone that they're going to have to pay
[00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:41.240]   month by month.
[00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:45.280]   Every time I go to Walmart and I see JVC as Magnavox, as licensed brands on garbage stuff,
[00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:49.080]   it just breaks my heart because those are all the consumer electronics companies.
[00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:56.080]   Kodak kills me because the Tecmo channel they had, they sent them an instant camera that
[00:54:56.080 --> 00:55:01.440]   I thought looked really cool because it kind of looked like a Polaroid SX-70, but it only
[00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:05.920]   folded a little bit, it was actually just a really really weird shape, has the Kodak
[00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:11.440]   branding, has the Kodak logo, and if you press the button and it has a Zinc Z-I-N-Q
[00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:17.120]   C, whatever printer in size, it takes a minute to print out the picture because it has like
[00:55:17.120 --> 00:55:18.880]   so little processing inside it.
[00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:24.640]   And yeah, somebody who like their first real camera was a Kodak 110 instrument, it's like,
[00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:27.040]   "Oh, that used to mean something."
[00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:31.680]   The next single movie used to say shot on Kodak Film and...
[00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:35.520]   They were like, "No, you're selling a blue, now you're putting that stick around a Bluetooth
[00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:37.200]   speaker, it makes me very sad."
[00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:42.200]   By the time Laurie, by the time you're my age, there'll be apples on everything.
[00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:43.960]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:55:43.960 --> 00:55:46.560]   The one line sees that apple to everybody.
[00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:49.720]   Food you's making digital cameras that now embed all their original film profiles.
[00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:51.960]   I just love that, that's like the best of all universes.
[00:55:51.960 --> 00:55:53.960]   Yeah, that's cool idea.
[00:55:53.960 --> 00:56:01.120]   Dan Morin writing at Macworld is "Stay Foolish" column, which is by the way the best name
[00:56:01.120 --> 00:56:03.880]   for a column of all time.
[00:56:03.880 --> 00:56:09.360]   Calling back to Steve Jobs, you know, what does it stay hungry, stay foolish, which is
[00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:13.840]   of course a call back to the coda of the whole earth catalog.
[00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:15.320]   So it has a long lineage.
[00:56:15.320 --> 00:56:18.520]   Apple's most significant moves of 2019.
[00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:21.960]   Number one, "Turning Pro."
[00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:28.120]   I have to say that both the new MacBook Pro and obviously the Mac Pro are phenomenal.
[00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:29.600]   Just give me my escape key.
[00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:30.600]   Wait in gold.
[00:56:30.600 --> 00:56:33.520]   Yeah, really nice.
[00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:39.760]   Miss puts and takes some missteps, air power of course, whatever happened to air power.
[00:56:39.760 --> 00:56:43.280]   It's with the Samsung Home's bigger.
[00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:46.200]   It sleeps with a few shots.
[00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:49.200]   It was too good apple.
[00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:53.280]   Apple didn't want people to feel bad that some people had and some people didn't because
[00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:55.520]   it was such a wonderful charging pad.
[00:56:55.520 --> 00:57:01.240]   He does point out that at least Apple improved the keyboard, admitted they're tacitly.
[00:57:01.240 --> 00:57:02.840]   They never admitted it out loud.
[00:57:02.840 --> 00:57:05.120]   They're mistake with the butterfly keyboard.
[00:57:05.120 --> 00:57:10.680]   I have to say the MacBook Pro 16-inch is in every way the sweetest machine.
[00:57:10.680 --> 00:57:13.640]   I just couldn't be happier with it.
[00:57:13.640 --> 00:57:17.720]   Are we getting a 13 or I guess 14-inch version of that?
[00:57:17.720 --> 00:57:21.240]   I want it so bad that I don't need the 16-inch screen.
[00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:24.000]   They've done staggered releases for a while.
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:27.960]   If you look at the old events, there was like, and now, like six months later, now the 13-inch
[00:57:27.960 --> 00:57:28.960]   version.
[00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:33.520]   Do you think they're watching telemetry on the keyboards to make sure that they're reliable
[00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:35.720]   and people on problems and complaints?
[00:57:35.720 --> 00:57:39.920]   I think they still low-key love the butterfly keyboard enough that they want to keep it
[00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:46.440]   on a potential low profile MacBook 12 replacement that may be in the works.
[00:57:46.440 --> 00:57:50.560]   I'm hoping that they realize that this keyboard is so good they should abandon.
[00:57:50.560 --> 00:57:55.280]   They should just put it with the ET cartridges, salt the earth and let the horses run over.
[00:57:55.280 --> 00:57:56.600]   It's not a lot of travel.
[00:57:56.600 --> 00:57:58.720]   It's still only a millimeter of travel.
[00:57:58.720 --> 00:58:03.200]   I think you could still make a MacBook Air or even a MacBook with that.
[00:58:03.200 --> 00:58:04.200]   I would love that.
[00:58:04.200 --> 00:58:05.880]   I want it everywhere.
[00:58:05.880 --> 00:58:08.320]   I miss my MacBook Air.
[00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:11.640]   I really liked it a lot, but I didn't like the butterfly keyboard.
[00:58:11.640 --> 00:58:17.480]   The 16 is fantastic, but I wouldn't mind a thin and light travel edition like the MacBook
[00:58:17.480 --> 00:58:18.480]   or a MacBook Air.
[00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:21.600]   I really liked the MacBook, actually, except for the keyboard.
[00:58:21.600 --> 00:58:23.920]   I really liked it.
[00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:24.920]   Service.
[00:58:24.920 --> 00:58:27.200]   This was the year of services, says Dan Morin for Apple.
[00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:28.640]   There's no question about that.
[00:58:28.640 --> 00:58:31.520]   Apple TV+ solid hit.
[00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:34.360]   Apple News Plus, maybe not so much.
[00:58:34.360 --> 00:58:35.360]   Apple Arcade.
[00:58:35.360 --> 00:58:36.360]   Apple Music.
[00:58:36.360 --> 00:58:38.920]   Definitely successes.
[00:58:38.920 --> 00:58:41.120]   Is Apple News Plus going to survive?
[00:58:41.120 --> 00:58:44.560]   Seems to be struggling.
[00:58:44.560 --> 00:58:45.560]   It's only in a few countries.
[00:58:45.560 --> 00:58:49.640]   The other services all launched in 100 countries and they just have so much momentum.
[00:58:49.640 --> 00:58:53.240]   Apple News Plus, it took them years to go to the first three launch countries just with
[00:58:53.240 --> 00:58:55.240]   Apple News.
[00:58:55.240 --> 00:58:58.520]   Because of the rights with Rogers and the US companies, I think it's in three countries,
[00:58:58.520 --> 00:59:05.240]   four countries, still, and they don't seem to have nailed the formula at all.
[00:59:05.240 --> 00:59:09.800]   If they can't get it rocketed and rolling in the United States, they haven't figured
[00:59:09.800 --> 00:59:12.800]   out what they want the product to be or how to make it relevant.
[00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:13.800]   There's some good news.
[00:59:13.800 --> 00:59:15.480]   I still pay for my News Plus subscription.
[00:59:15.480 --> 00:59:16.480]   I love reading the magazine.
[00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:17.800]   It's because of the magazines, right?
[00:59:17.800 --> 00:59:18.800]   I do.
[00:59:18.800 --> 00:59:19.800]   Yeah.
[00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:20.800]   There's still some.
[00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:21.800]   I think it's a niche thing.
[00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:23.800]   The interface is still so hard for me.
[00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:24.800]   They need it.
[00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:25.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:26.800]   Because it's basically texture.
[00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:27.800]   They need to update that.
[00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:28.800]   Yeah.
[00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:32.640]   Some of that is just telling the magazines, "Look, you can't just give us a PDF.
[00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:33.640]   You have to make it."
[00:59:33.640 --> 00:59:34.640]   And you can't even search.
[00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:38.160]   I see an article and I go on the web and it says, "You've run out of your articles.
[00:59:38.160 --> 00:59:39.160]   You can't read it."
[00:59:39.160 --> 00:59:41.560]   You have to title it to Apple News and it can't find it.
[00:59:41.560 --> 00:59:46.400]   So I have to go to the Wall Street Journal or the Toronto Star in Apple News and then
[00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:47.680]   you can't search it to Apple News.
[00:59:47.680 --> 00:59:51.480]   I scroll and in the second article, it's 22 days old and I just don't know what to do
[00:59:51.480 --> 00:59:56.640]   with my life anymore at that point.
[00:59:56.640 --> 00:59:57.640]   There is good news.
[00:59:57.640 --> 01:00:03.200]   DigiDay interviewed an unidentified magazine executive saying, "We're happy to be on Apple
[01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:06.400]   Plus because it's another way to increase subscription revenue.
[01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:09.560]   It's not a huge boon for our business or anything like that.
[01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:11.280]   It's not really relevant.
[01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:14.760]   That publication claims $20,000 a month.
[01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:19.440]   It says that's not enough to justify it, but the gain in subscriptions is apparently just
[01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:21.680]   enough to keep it on the platform.
[01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:23.240]   So they're going to renew their contract.
[01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:25.800]   They didn't say which publisher.
[01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:30.840]   They did, "Essence," which is encouraged by how much it's increased subscription since
[01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:32.440]   joining.
[01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:35.800]   I think a lot of people forgot that Essence existed.
[01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:37.240]   The topic is good though.
[01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:41.760]   A lot of people said, "You got a lot of traffic from the news."
[01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:47.040]   By the way, the other thing Essence did right is they made it look nice on the...
[01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:48.880]   They didn't just send us a PDF.
[01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:49.880]   It looks good.
[01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:55.700]   In fact, they intentionally wanted to make it look like their magazine on Apple's News
[01:00:55.700 --> 01:01:01.240]   Plus was a native property and I think they did a good job of that.
[01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:03.400]   Yeah, the jury's still out.
[01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:08.760]   I'll give it the jury's still out on News Plus, but definitely now that I've seen the end
[01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:13.960]   of Morning Show, I would say Apple TV Plus is not a home run.
[01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:15.240]   There was no Game of Thrones.
[01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:20.240]   There was no Stranger Things, but definitely a very solid first year.
[01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:24.480]   I also might argue that we haven't seen the end of Servants for Season.
[01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:25.480]   That might be...
[01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:26.480]   Oh, it's really good.
[01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:27.480]   Yeah.
[01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:28.680]   I mean, that one is...
[01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:32.280]   You know, Shyamalan's got some massive twist at the end, right?
[01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:33.280]   Yeah.
[01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:34.280]   Yeah.
[01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:35.280]   Last one.
[01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:36.280]   Has anyone seen Bruce Willis lately?
[01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:37.280]   Yeah.
[01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:40.360]   I see dead babies.
[01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:41.360]   Let's see.
[01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:43.320]   Going into 2020, Dan Morrin wrapping up.
[01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:46.240]   Plenty more is happening.
[01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:48.040]   Actually, plenty more happened in 2019.
[01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:49.040]   Let's not forget.
[01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:50.880]   Catalyst, iOS 13.
[01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:54.760]   It was a mess for a while, but it does add some really significant features.
[01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:57.600]   iPadOS huge.
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:01:58.840]   That came out this year, right?
[01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:00.560]   It didn't come out in 2012.
[01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:01.560]   No, 2012.
[01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:02.960]   What am I talking about?
[01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:04.960]   That was a straight year.
[01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:05.960]   2018.
[01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:11.120]   I think the iPhone 11 is arguably the best version.
[01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:15.440]   Certainly the camera is the best version ever.
[01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:18.520]   AirPods Pro, we just talked about that.
[01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:19.520]   Pretty strong.
[01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:21.000]   It's my favorite iPhone since the iPhone 4.
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.000]   I don't say that.
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.000]   I agree with you.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.000]   I love the iPhone 7 as well.
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.000]   I agree with you.
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:30.920]   I think it's hard in an incremental, every year is an incremental increase now.
[01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:34.880]   It's hard to do anything to make it stand out, but I think the OLED screens have really
[01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:35.880]   come into their own.
[01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:36.880]   The quality is excellent.
[01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:38.840]   These cameras, especially the one I was watching.
[01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:40.600]   Jonathan Morrison's HDR.
[01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:44.400]   He did an HDR episode to show the HDR display.
[01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:47.640]   I don't have an HDR display, so I watched it on the iPhone display.
[01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:51.920]   It is amazing when you push that thing, what it can really do in terms of brightness and
[01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:53.240]   contrast levels.
[01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:56.320]   On a phone, Leo.
[01:02:56.320 --> 01:02:57.880]   I think the iPhone 11, nothing.
[01:02:57.880 --> 01:03:05.080]   Even if you don't go pro, I really think it's hard to really articulate why.
[01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:12.880]   I really think that it's the coming together of a lot of long and hard work to produce
[01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:19.240]   a affordable premium phone that is just tens across the board.
[01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:26.240]   I was a little bit worried when the iPhone 10 was first released thinking, "Oh, man,
[01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:32.440]   I'm going to have to now have two tiers of the poor people and the 1% are buying phones."
[01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:38.640]   It really was an example of Apple charging more to really get the kinks out of certain
[01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:42.400]   technologies and certain manufacturing and then figuring out a way to put everything
[01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:43.680]   that you would have loved.
[01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:47.280]   All the reasons why you lusted after an iPhone 10 when it was released, but you held off
[01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:53.040]   because you couldn't afford it back then to taking it and making it better and putting
[01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:54.880]   it into a much less expensive package.
[01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:59.600]   I really think the iPhone 11, nothing, is one of the best iPhones in the entire series.
[01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:01.600]   And I'm using this a lot of it.
[01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:02.600]   It didn't do well.
[01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:06.600]   But the technology from HomePod that's in the MacBook Pro speakers and in the iPhone
[01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:08.720]   11 speakers have spatial audio.
[01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:09.720]   Oh my God.
[01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:15.720]   The stereo imaging on the MacBook Pro is mind boggling.
[01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:21.560]   I mean, that is the best sounding laptop ever by a long shot.
[01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:23.480]   It really is good.
[01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:28.160]   2019 was Apple's year to nail it for almost everything.
[01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:36.800]   If you think about the sort of the fact that the iPhone 11 is almost exactly just as good
[01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:41.680]   as the Pro models is fantastic for most people who need a phone.
[01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:47.120]   The AirPods Pro finally made a pair of AirPods that more people can wear comfortably that
[01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:49.240]   you're less likely to drop out of your ears.
[01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:52.800]   The 16-inch MacBook Pro has the keyboard that everybody loves.
[01:04:52.800 --> 01:05:01.200]   iPadOS has made the iPad very, very close to an actual computer replacement.
[01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:02.840]   And this is all in 2019.
[01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:08.240]   Yeah, this has been a really good year for them in terms of finally hitting that product
[01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:12.760]   in that software that's exactly what everybody's looking for.
[01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:15.360]   And let's not forget, there were big departures.
[01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:18.680]   Angela Aron's left, Johnny I've left.
[01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:21.600]   The executive team was very much shaken up.
[01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:24.920]   But I think Apple showed that it's core competencies are very, very strong.
[01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:28.320]   I think they're a mature company now.
[01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:32.840]   They're not going to have a new iPhone every year or even every decade.
[01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:35.320]   But boy, they've really doubled down on the stuff they make.
[01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:37.960]   And I think it's quite good.
[01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:44.240]   I'm a little nervous about this notarization thing coming up next year.
[01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:51.160]   Starting in February, Apple has announced now, developers who create Mac apps that are not
[01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:55.680]   in the store will have to have them notarized.
[01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:57.240]   Now they delayed this.
[01:05:57.240 --> 01:06:01.840]   It was going to happen with Catalina and they said, "Okay, we'll put it off."
[01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:04.680]   But this is going to be official.
[01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:05.680]   Please clarify, Renee.
[01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:08.080]   I don't know if you've done any reporting on this.
[01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:10.840]   I am worried about third party apps.
[01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:12.400]   Am I going to be able to open them at all?
[01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:16.360]   Or do I have to turn off gatekeeper, open them and then turn it back on?
[01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:18.040]   What is the process going to be?
[01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:21.760]   I think if you have a naked install, if you buy a new machine and you bring it home,
[01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:25.640]   you'll have to do that terminal command that will bring up that, allow any app to launch
[01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:28.040]   setting in gatekeeper and then you enable that.
[01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:29.520]   There won't be a manual way.
[01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:34.360]   You can't right click and open anymore.
[01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:35.360]   This is unclear.
[01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:37.040]   I'm hoping, yeah, it's unclear.
[01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:40.520]   I know for sure if you turn off, if you do that thing and it gives you the turn off gatekeeper
[01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:43.640]   command and you tap that, then it doesn't care what you launch anymore.
[01:06:43.640 --> 01:06:47.320]   It just ops you completely out.
[01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:51.480]   I don't know what the right click will do because I don't have a system that enforces
[01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:52.480]   gatekeeper yet.
[01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:53.480]   Oh.
[01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:54.480]   We might have to see it.
[01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:56.320]   But right now it works.
[01:06:56.320 --> 01:06:57.320]   Yeah.
[01:06:57.320 --> 01:06:58.320]   The right click.
[01:06:58.320 --> 01:06:59.720]   I don't think it'll right click a lot.
[01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:01.880]   There's some apps that I use like Joplin.
[01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:03.960]   The guy is not an Apple developer.
[01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:05.640]   He hasn't gotten it notarized.
[01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:08.040]   But I can still right click and open it.
[01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:11.480]   And I do when there's an update and they're fairly frequently updated.
[01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:16.600]   The nice thing about this command and you publish this an iMore with all sorts of caveats.
[01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:21.560]   But it uses the SPCTL command.
[01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:24.440]   You have to do it as root.
[01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:29.680]   And you type SPCTL, which is probably what software protection or something like that,
[01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:31.680]   SP control.
[01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:34.760]   Dash dash master disable.
[01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:35.760]   Turns that off.
[01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:39.480]   Now what happens is that disables gatekeeper.
[01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:45.400]   But I think as I remember you can confirm this if I'm wrong or it's denied if I'm wrong.
[01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:49.840]   But I think I still can go to the control panel, the system preference pane.
[01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:51.680]   And there are now three entries, right?
[01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:52.680]   Yeah.
[01:07:52.680 --> 01:07:53.680]   And so I.
[01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:54.680]   Yeah.
[01:07:54.680 --> 01:07:55.520]   So it adds that third entry.
[01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:56.760]   Just install anything anywhere.
[01:07:56.760 --> 01:08:02.120]   I can even after using this command line go back to the system preference pane, set it
[01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:07.240]   back to a more secure setting and leave it there.
[01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:10.240]   So I don't have to turn this back on.
[01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:12.520]   I am like I have I have feelings about this.
[01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:16.960]   Like so like on one hand if you're just someone who has an iPhone and you bought a Mac and
[01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:21.880]   you like that's that's the extent of your computing like portfolio or whatever.
[01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:26.040]   Like there are some like there's malware and ransomware and spy all these threats out
[01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:27.040]   there.
[01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:30.880]   And this will just make your Mac run more like an iOS device and you won't have to worry
[01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:32.720]   about those things as much.
[01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:37.760]   But if you're a seasoned Mac person this stuff just greats on your soul and I still wish like
[01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:41.960]   you can turn off SCP you can turn off all the stuff that there was just and I know a lot
[01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:45.120]   of people get upset about this especially security people you could just type in like
[01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:50.120]   a Konami code and unlock it and it runs the way the Mac always runs because you're an adult
[01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:53.760]   and if you if you click on an infected link and that was your bad damn it.
[01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:57.800]   I just wish we could better balance these things so that it is up like your you start
[01:08:57.800 --> 01:08:59.960]   off with a really well protected system.
[01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:04.000]   But if you hate that you can just easily and permanently turn it off and not have to worry
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:05.000]   about it.
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:10.520]   I'm cool with the idea that you have to be sophisticated enough at least have good enough
[01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:11.520]   Google foo.
[01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:12.520]   Yes.
[01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:17.720]   That you could find this terminal command because once you execute it this is what your security
[01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:23.040]   and privacy system preference pain is going to have it's going to turn back on that third
[01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:24.040]   option anywhere.
[01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:27.800]   Now you're not going to want to leave it there you're going to want to put it back to App
[01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:34.000]   Store and identify developers which is right you know once this change happens the notarization
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:39.720]   change happens in February I think those two will be the only option and right click will
[01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:42.600]   stop working that's my prediction.
[01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:47.360]   So you'll will want to add this anywhere and then you can if you want to install something
[01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:50.840]   like Joplin you can go back to anywhere.
[01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:57.440]   What happens if I write software in Xcode or I create I create Mac OS apps all the time
[01:09:57.440 --> 01:10:02.640]   with a third party tool called Dr. Racket what happens with that can I I mean if I'm
[01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:07.120]   just creating it for my own computer can I run my own apps.
[01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:13.480]   I have to get them notarize but it doesn't exist yet so it's hard it's hard to tell what
[01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:18.400]   like even by like if they do it badly my one of my worst fears is always they do something
[01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:20.200]   unintentionally terrible.
[01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:22.400]   Yeah it takes like a month to fix it.
[01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:27.440]   Because I mean that's that's a show stopper if I'm a developer or just a hobbyist I like
[01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:32.880]   to write code I write apps I want my apps to run if I have to get a development it's
[01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:36.280]   only ninety nine dollars I understand but I have to buy a developer account I already
[01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:42.840]   have one but and then a submit my personal app that I'm running on my computer to Apple
[01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:46.560]   for notarization before I can run it that's a show stopper I don't think that's what's
[01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:47.560]   going to happen.
[01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:52.840]   Yeah it's they have to they have to try to very very careful line here because that there
[01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:56.840]   has to be a difference between the experience of using a Mac and the experience of using
[01:10:56.840 --> 01:11:03.400]   an iPad that right there's I love the fact that I've got an iPad and it's a pain in the
[01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:07.800]   butt sometimes because it locks things down and sandbox is things so carefully but on
[01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:11.280]   the other hand it's the one computer that I worry the least about I think the least
[01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:15.400]   about however the fact that I can get away with that because I have this Mac book and
[01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:20.840]   I have this desktop Mac that I can do whatever I want with and the idea that if I've got a
[01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:24.640]   six year old camera I have a six year old camera they still love it works great and
[01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:30.280]   if Olympus has released here's a desktop app you need in order to apply the latest firmware
[01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:36.640]   update and the last last time they updated that app was four or five years ago that's
[01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:40.920]   going to make me angry not at Olympus for not updating this app but an apple for artificially
[01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:47.360]   saying no no no I know that you trust Olympus but our robot our robot gatekeeper doesn't
[01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:52.400]   trust Olympus on therefore we're not letting you run this app you're welcome so I am but
[01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:58.760]   I I agree with Renee I love these solutions where we're not going to let somebody who doesn't
[01:11:58.760 --> 01:12:03.400]   know what they're doing get themselves into trouble but if you pass if you pass this leap
[01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:09.960]   of faith of some kind if you if you've demonstrated to yourself that look if you actually a googled
[01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:15.520]   for this did a search for this specific issue and then like knew how to go into the command
[01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:20.640]   open a terminal window and knew how to enter command we're going to guess that you're responsible
[01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:25.160]   enough that we shouldn't nanny you quite so much just just like on the Android phones
[01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:30.000]   you can you can enter developer mode just by tapping right tapping the the the version
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:35.240]   number and a number five seven times says okay you're you've almost you've almost established
[01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:39.520]   developer mode keep tapping so okay we have to we guess that if you know this trick then
[01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:45.000]   it's okay for you to have access to this sort of these sort of features the the quote
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:51.080]   from the Apple support document is I think intentionally obscure beginning with Mac OS
[01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:57.120]   10 14.5 which is by the way we already have software signed with the new this is what's
[01:12:57.120 --> 01:13:02.320]   weird software signed with a new develop righty certificate and all new or updated kernel
[01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:07.960]   extensions must be notarized to run that I understand so if I don't sign it can I open
[01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:12.400]   it and that's the problem is starting next February if it's unsigned it doesn't have
[01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:20.440]   a developer ID at all then what do I do then what happens can I not open it at all I think
[01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:24.480]   there's one as they leave that command that terminal command I think that what will happen
[01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:29.440]   is everybody who writes software everybody who cares everybody who watches this show will
[01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:34.560]   know it and it's a simple command it's easy to yeah again the only problem the only thing
[01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:38.120]   I'm really worried about is again abandoned apps they're still very very useful it's
[01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:42.280]   just that whoever was developing it moved on they graduate they graduated school or they
[01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:46.800]   switch jobs but it's still a really great app it's just that Apple knows that there's
[01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:52.040]   just I just you know and there's too many developers at Apple for this to to continue
[01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:56.600]   here's a kind of a funny one you may remember the city of San Francisco along with other
[01:13:56.600 --> 01:14:04.000]   cities banned face recognition for city employees turns out that as a side effect you may not
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:11.560]   like it also makes the iPhone is banned because it uses face ID so the board of supervisors
[01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:18.440]   in San Francisco quickly set to rewrite that ban I imagine Oakland California and Somerville
[01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:24.320]   Massachusetts which have similar rules will have to do the same thing there is a face recognition
[01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:29.560]   ban in Brookline Massachusetts which was passed last week that does have exemption for personal
[01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:35.880]   devices used by city officials so I guess we're gonna have to just keep that in mind now because
[01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:46.920]   face ID is a part of a lot of new phones including the pixel for I don't know if I like this
[01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:53.840]   or not we talked about it on iOS today earlier Apple has introduced a spec for strobe accessories
[01:14:53.840 --> 01:14:59.440]   with the iPhone 11 flash that it worked with a flash I don't like flashes to begin with
[01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:03.760]   no this is great that's a loom cube that's the one you recommended Annie and I use and
[01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:09.040]   it does have two modes it has a continuous light mode as well as a strobe mode so what
[01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:17.680]   I'll connect this by my airport but not airport lightning port and it'll know when the flash
[01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:22.440]   is that it it's a broad spec that will let you synchronize the shutter with an external
[01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:27.880]   illumination illuminator and this it's a little bit cagey on exactly how it's going to work
[01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:31.480]   but the fact that they're thinking about this at all I think is a great thing for iPhone
[01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:36.600]   photography it doesn't make it more of a pro product doesn't it yeah and also it's nice
[01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:42.560]   to have a low light mode it's nice to have a multicolor LED that does such a good job
[01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:48.960]   but when you get down to it's on camera yeah it's well yeah and also there's nothing that
[01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:55.480]   can be the strobe for actually giving you real real like illumination real light that penetrates
[01:15:55.480 --> 01:15:59.480]   more than like two and a half three feet right and the number of people who will use this
[01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:05.600]   just they they're not going to get like a Nikon SB 600 flash the size of a shoe but
[01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:08.520]   they're going to get maybe a little pocket flash maybe something exactly like the loom
[01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:14.160]   cube that now that will have an extra actual strobe on it not just a really bright LED and
[01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:18.800]   the ability to say gee it's too bad that I can't like highlight I can't get more light
[01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:23.800]   on the family in the foreground because I can't get them all in the picture but if I stand
[01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:28.040]   close enough for the light to work it'll just salt it's ill I love the fact that we're now
[01:16:28.040 --> 01:16:33.520]   at the point of iPhone photography where we have to go into every single nook and cranny
[01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:37.760]   of photography to find out okay is there anything is there any kind of picture we can't take
[01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:42.520]   now like oh oh that's right that's right there's some that require flash great will do some
[01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:46.960]   sort of a software synchronization thingy next okay okay is there a way that we can do
[01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:51.920]   it in underwater well not without sealing up things okay we'll work on that next it's
[01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:56.360]   it's about removing restrictions to creativity and this is why this is an exciting thing I
[01:16:56.360 --> 01:17:03.240]   bought I've won my picks of the week a while ago was this little $60 $70 wireless flash
[01:17:03.240 --> 01:17:07.880]   that's about size with deck of cards and leaves it's you can use as a regular flash
[01:17:07.880 --> 01:17:12.880]   and a hot shoe but you can also detach the hot for detach it from this little base and
[01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:16.880]   becomes a wireless flash and the pictures I was taking at that my first comic-con after
[01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:22.200]   it portraits of cosplayers just by being able to hold the hold of flash off camera into
[01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:27.600]   the side made just such a huge difference and I can't imagine how much cooler iPhone
[01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:31.520]   photography can be when people just have the ability to take something the size of an ice
[01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:35.840]   cube like the lume cube and suddenly be using off camera flash and just getting so much
[01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:39.240]   more creative and so much into their photography what's that name of that little flash because
[01:17:39.240 --> 01:17:43.200]   I bought it to I can't remember the name of the time oh god I can't remember it is
[01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:48.560]   smart when I showed it to him and he bought it too it was we're all excited but how does
[01:17:48.560 --> 01:17:54.680]   it trigger the strobe it does doesn't it it's well this this device I'm talking about it
[01:17:54.680 --> 01:18:00.240]   actually has the leaves behind like a you can press a button and it will eject the body
[01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:04.160]   of the flash from whatever oh that's right attached to your camera yeah yeah yeah yeah
[01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:09.200]   suppose so it would not work with an iPhone it wouldn't do that with an iPhone yet no no
[01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:14.480]   but you could imagine if it's simple enough how they could create a flash the creative
[01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:18.800]   flash sync shoe right something you could attach the bottom of any thing any flash that
[01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:23.240]   would either in a wired fashion attached to hopefully the USB C connector on the bottom
[01:18:23.240 --> 01:18:28.360]   of your iPhone 12 or even just synchronized by a Bluetooth where there'll be a shutter
[01:18:28.360 --> 01:18:33.480]   delay but that delay will be enough to make sure that the flash is firing during the 1/6th
[01:18:33.480 --> 01:18:38.200]   of a second that the the electronic shutter is going yeah I really like that device I'm
[01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:43.640]   trying to find the name of it I I I I I officially did not buy it on Amazon I bought it I bought
[01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:48.840]   it from the Hong Kong distributor and so I can't search my Amazon for it I'm so I'm searching
[01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:52.760]   for it now and and I know it's there because I actually bought a second one because you
[01:18:52.760 --> 01:18:56.840]   can actually use more than one off the same signal I like that I like the the first one
[01:18:56.840 --> 01:19:01.200]   that so much I might buy a second one too is such and it's so light and simple and it uses
[01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:05.160]   regular batteries so you can keep it in your I'd send my camera bag that's why I don't
[01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:09.760]   have it here but it's just yeah right little doohickey and yeah I would love to see that
[01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:16.280]   have some sort of sync for for the iPhone it's become the iPhone cameras now so good
[01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:21.520]   it's on and with the zoom and the wide yes it's the light picks labs that's it's a flash
[01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:27.760]   cue I also I got it for my for my dad for his birthday coming up in January oh shh don't
[01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:34.040]   tell dad what's it's so cool and it is on Amazon although I had to presume stuff I will
[01:19:34.040 --> 01:19:39.120]   not reach for my pixel as much as I still do this is this is the flash Q22 with a new
[01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:46.240]   T2 transmitter built in law this is the new one whoa has a lithium ion battery yeah for
[01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:52.840]   the for the the flash itself runs on two double A's the remote part that stays on your camera
[01:19:52.840 --> 01:19:58.880]   runs on it's only okay but but if you buy your charge if you keep rechargeable batteries
[01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:03.160]   and you can just plug it into by any use you speak charger and will charge the batteries
[01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:08.000]   inside the flash right we won't I won't go into it again but it's I love design like
[01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:13.880]   this where they think the simple things that they can add onto that don't add to the cost
[01:20:13.880 --> 01:20:17.520]   really don't add to the complexity but just hey what if we what if instead of make it
[01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:21.800]   really sexy and rounded curves and like a clam shell what if we just made it square
[01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:26.360]   on every edge so that you can actually just put it you can just stand it on a bookshelf
[01:20:26.360 --> 01:20:31.760]   or stand it on any surface if since it's going to be a remote flash right really clever yeah
[01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:35.280]   really cool yeah I don't mind giving that a second plug because it's such a useful little
[01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:40.560]   device and yeah I mean where the iPhone has become that camera I'm I think day is not
[01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:46.080]   far off when I stopped carrying my camera bag and my thousands of dollars worth of equipment
[01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:53.640]   I just use my phone yep getting very close tomorrow something happens in the app store

[01:23:42.200 --> 01:23:47.240]   is the only bad part of the of buying these socks was learning that the the sesame street
[01:23:47.240 --> 01:23:53.200]   socks were almost completely out of out of stock in my soul man but yeah that's that that
[01:23:53.200 --> 01:23:57.160]   is like there's a long this I should keep keep a list of all these little things that
[01:23:57.160 --> 01:24:02.240]   you don't that that show that you're an adult versus a kid and these little things like
[01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:06.520]   one of them is like getting socks for Christmas and you're like oh really nice like little
[01:24:06.520 --> 01:24:13.360]   merino wool socks like oh oh that's no lovely actually my mom I could I just buy like regular

[01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:31.640]   they we now know the badges for the new ring in the new year activity challenge it'll be
[01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:36.560]   back in January I guess I didn't know they skipped last year so you didn't get a 2019
[01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:43.800]   badge there's the 2020 badge I know Renee you're all about the badges I you know I've
[01:24:43.800 --> 01:24:48.920]   I've really been up and down with it this year because I I have like these patterns and
[01:24:48.920 --> 01:24:53.880]   try to make videos every day has really disrupted every pattern in my life I'm looking forward
[01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:57.640]   to trying getting trying getting them all again it just it's not that I didn't do stuff
[01:24:57.640 --> 01:25:02.240]   it's I didn't do it in the exact way you needed to to get like a five kilometers all at once
[01:25:02.240 --> 01:25:07.480]   or this thing by this time I wasn't flexible enough you'll be able to do this one you have
[01:25:07.480 --> 01:25:13.280]   to complete all three rings seven days in a row anytime in the month in January you can
[01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:20.720]   do that yes yes you close your rings don't you sometimes oh vectors not stopping you from
[01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:25.200]   closing your rings no but it's like weird it's like well one I wish that there was some
[01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:29.040]   because like sometimes you want a plane that's so long it really cuts out the hours in the
[01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:34.040]   end you have to cheat to sort of try to get the stand rings and or sometimes it's just
[01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:37.560]   like you've you completely injured yourself for your sick and you can't complete like
[01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:43.520]   the 30 minute and I would love the idea of like like this is a cheat day or this is
[01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:47.480]   my day off sort of a thing where you didn't ruin your streaks but you could be a normal
[01:25:47.480 --> 01:25:54.520]   human being that's that's absolutely right I got I I hurt my leg like a couple months
[01:25:54.520 --> 01:25:58.760]   ago and so like I've been on crutches for like a couple it's it's fine it's just like
[01:25:58.760 --> 01:26:03.960]   a pensioner that's being solved by time and and and P and physical therapy so don't
[01:26:03.960 --> 01:26:08.120]   don't worry about that but it's like I it's every single device that I have the tracks
[01:26:08.120 --> 01:26:15.920]   fitness is going into like sympathy mode yes what what if we change your move target from
[01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:23.360]   20 minutes to 15 minutes and like how can I tell you can I tell you that I you it would
[01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:29.040]   be so great if you could tell these apps it okay look the doctor says that that I should
[01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:35.600]   be like right as rain by mid January said I could you focus on like just the hey great
[01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:41.120]   you you achieved your goal of just doing moving around more today than you did yesterday or
[01:26:41.120 --> 01:26:46.560]   more this week than last week because it's like I don't I don't need I don't need pity
[01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:51.680]   for my fitness app I know that I haven't been I know that that I have been doing my like
[01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:58.840]   three mile constitutional since like mid October are you I wanted I did my I did my three month
[01:26:58.840 --> 01:27:02.560]   later Apple Watch series five review and I just realized because I've been doing all
[01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:06.280]   the quantitative life stuff that was like one of my goals for the last for this review
[01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:11.880]   was to do like the the hydration one and the sleep one and I and usually I have all notifications
[01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:16.000]   turned off because I hate them they're so interruptive and distracting but in order for these to
[01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:22.240]   work they have to be on and I just I would love for iOS 7 sorry watch OS 7 next year for
[01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:26.640]   Apple to make some sort of smart notification coalescence so that if it realizes you haven't
[01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:31.160]   drunk anything recently it dispatches that message to the central system and it goes oh
[01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:33.960]   we're gonna bug him about standing up in seven minutes we're gonna just we're not gonna
[01:27:33.960 --> 01:27:37.360]   send him this now we're gonna cue it and then we're gonna say stand up and go get some
[01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:41.560]   water and that way we're not saying get water oh now go stand up oh it's a good now you have
[01:27:41.560 --> 01:27:48.960]   this message just like being assistant yeah I like that idea new arcade game builders journey

[01:31:20.600 --> 01:31:26.000]   hate taking with me when I travel is the the Apple watch charger that comes with the
[01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:32.560]   Apple watch that long cord and you know this disc that just flops around and I love having
[01:31:32.560 --> 01:31:37.680]   something I can take with me but I also have like my favorite Apple watch charger which
[01:31:37.680 --> 01:31:41.640]   does not have or my favorite iPhone charger which does not have an Apple watch charger
[01:31:41.640 --> 01:31:46.760]   on it so I like this you just it plugs into something that you already have with you
[01:31:46.760 --> 01:31:50.840]   right and plug it into your MacBook Pro that's a really great idea.
[01:31:50.840 --> 01:31:57.080]   Stucky's a good company too I think I trust trust them they make a lot of different charging
[01:31:57.080 --> 01:32:07.760]   I have a cetecu light that I love they make kind of goofy stuff let's see what else.
[01:32:07.760 --> 01:32:12.560]   Mythic Quest I would guess this is a show for Renee Richie.
[01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:17.360]   Apple is already ordered a second season of it the series hasn't even launched it'll
[01:32:17.360 --> 01:32:22.920]   launch in February what is this about Renee you oh it's centered around a team of video
[01:32:22.920 --> 01:32:30.760]   game developers as they navigate the challenges of running a popular bit of video game oh from
[01:32:30.760 --> 01:32:36.640]   the team they created it's always sunny in Philadelphia oh yeah that sounds yeah they're
[01:32:36.640 --> 01:32:41.840]   just in stuff coming yeah oh I like this I'm starting to like this so obviously it'll
[01:32:41.840 --> 01:32:49.080]   be comedic half hour nine episodes this could be the next Silicon Valley mythic I'm still
[01:32:49.080 --> 01:32:52.040]   waiting on the Spielberg show too I don't know when that's coming out oh that's right
[01:32:52.040 --> 01:33:00.080]   amazing stories yeah amazing stories amazing stories do your I have ordered the AirPods
[01:33:00.080 --> 01:33:06.400]   Pro as I mentioned I'm prepared for them to smell like blueberries but do yours I can't
[01:33:06.400 --> 01:33:13.680]   bring myself to smell them I just can't I'm now I read this story did Renee oh my gosh
[01:33:13.680 --> 01:33:21.120]   why do they smell like blueberries and model glue is it just the case are you are you actually
[01:33:21.120 --> 01:33:24.640]   smelling one of your AirPods you just smelling the case I don't even think I can do that
[01:33:24.640 --> 01:33:30.840]   mica would be horrified right now Fred Rico Vittichy I think discovered this a few days
[01:33:30.840 --> 01:33:36.200]   ago he tweeted I hate that the internet made me smell my AirPods because they totally smell
[01:33:36.200 --> 01:33:44.440]   like blueberries yeah well now I really want to know I know but I refuse to do it I just
[01:33:44.440 --> 01:33:49.520]   I can't do it I can't it does yeah I forgot about it and thank you very much for bringing
[01:33:49.520 --> 01:33:55.320]   it up again because now I'm come on interested in knowing but I still can't do it that's
[01:33:55.320 --> 01:34:02.320]   my question why would you not want to sniff your funds let mica tell you the words are
[01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:17.480]   great let's see snow crash will be coming to HBO Max I don't know if I have mixed feelings
[01:34:17.480 --> 01:34:21.640]   about that one of the great sci-fi novels of all time with perhaps the best first chapter
[01:34:21.640 --> 01:34:26.480]   ever written by Neil Stevenson I don't know what kind of I hate so I foundation is still
[01:34:26.480 --> 01:34:30.640]   coming to Apple as well that is not yet either a lot of times sci-fi does not make the move
[01:34:30.640 --> 01:34:34.880]   to the small screen very well but on the other hand there's the expanse has been really good
[01:34:34.880 --> 01:34:41.840]   yeah this is very good so it's it's it's interesting that although I'm glad I'm so glad
[01:34:41.840 --> 01:34:46.440]   that a lot of money is being thrown at making these adaptations of these classic books I
[01:34:46.440 --> 01:34:51.560]   just the only worry every time I hear about one of these shows being licensed by HBO where
[01:34:51.560 --> 01:34:55.640]   another streaming network is that you do realize that this was a book that was written with
[01:34:55.640 --> 01:35:02.120]   a beginning and a middle and an end you can't just take the world from chapter one and try
[01:35:02.120 --> 01:35:07.240]   to get eight seasons out of it they barely got away with that with the Hobbit yeah you
[01:35:07.240 --> 01:35:11.120]   know yeah and they're trying it with Witcher now and Amazon is doing the not the Silmerlion
[01:35:11.120 --> 01:35:16.120]   right the part that happens between the Silmerlion and Lord of the Rings it's even weirder so
[01:35:16.120 --> 01:35:21.880]   the Witcher is based on the video game right no it's the book no looks oh there's a book
[01:35:21.880 --> 01:35:25.560]   or the short stories I think the first season is based on a couple of the short stories oh
[01:35:25.560 --> 01:35:29.920]   I thought it was the video game the Witcher is the Witcher video game based on the book
[01:35:29.920 --> 01:35:36.360]   the guy looks like the devil looks like the guy from the game yes yes the game the game
[01:35:36.360 --> 01:35:42.760]   that you know yeah comes after way after the stuff that's happening in the show this is
[01:35:42.760 --> 01:35:47.840]   such a nerd and they're supposed to do seven season I mean she says I am the show on her
[01:35:47.840 --> 01:35:53.520]   it says she has seven seasons planned out what this is Netflix hope to make a game of
[01:35:53.520 --> 01:35:57.920]   Thrones isn't it this is they're really they're banking on this one like I said Hercules and
[01:35:57.920 --> 01:36:02.680]   Zeno with good production value is it is it as good as Game of Thrones Hercules and
[01:36:02.680 --> 01:36:06.400]   Zeno with good production that's not a good one it's a different era Leo like these were
[01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:10.920]   written a long time ago and I know Game of Thrones is taking a long time to write but it doesn't
[01:36:10.920 --> 01:36:15.720]   have the level of political yeah yeah intrigue and power brokering that a Game of Thrones
[01:36:15.720 --> 01:36:20.520]   would have somebody know it really is like month of the week plus some plot I think it
[01:36:20.520 --> 01:36:28.080]   was Zanep Tuficke who noted and I thought this was really astute of her that most novels
[01:36:28.080 --> 01:36:35.040]   and certainly almost all TV shows are based on human psychology like you look at you know
[01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:39.880]   the psychology of this guy versus that guy versus that girl versus you know that that
[01:36:39.880 --> 01:36:47.080]   kind of the the inner mingling of human psychology's Game of Thrones was more strategic politically
[01:36:47.080 --> 01:36:54.280]   it was the humans were less important it was the overarching politics and things happening
[01:36:54.280 --> 01:36:59.920]   in the north and stuff that motivated humans and that was that had a longer lasting more
[01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:04.880]   and I'm probably not saying her name or role in her war the roses right it was polys I
[01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:11.720]   not psychology versus psychology and I think I think that it ran true for me I thought
[01:37:11.720 --> 01:37:18.880]   it was kind of astute until the past and her her thesis was until the past couple seasons
[01:37:18.880 --> 01:37:26.160]   yeah it went back into personal yeah cycle yeah that's right it became less rich right
[01:37:26.160 --> 01:37:31.320]   human psychology is fine and it drives a lot of stuff but but it's the it's these you
[01:37:31.320 --> 01:37:38.240]   know grand grand themes that are more interesting was in it war the roses Leo that was what
[01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:44.600]   the inspiration of the war the roses that's right yeah and the Lannisters are the Lancaster's
[01:37:44.600 --> 01:37:50.320]   and yeah they're at all if ex worth looking into if your Game of Thrones fan and again
[01:37:50.320 --> 01:37:53.480]   and again the human like our real history is way we're good than any book you could
[01:37:53.480 --> 01:37:57.720]   that's why it's great and really our real history as you look back the psychology of
[01:37:57.720 --> 01:38:01.360]   the humans disappears what was Henry VIII psychology nobody knows but you know about
[01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:08.640]   the forces that created you know the events of his of the Tudor era yeah so that's kind
[01:38:08.640 --> 01:38:15.800]   of why we like history maybe it's less psychology yeah oh yeah yeah if you have if you if it
[01:38:15.800 --> 01:38:24.440]   absolutely positively have to have a Mac iPhone iPad or Apple watch in two hours you got one
[01:38:24.440 --> 01:38:31.440]   more day through Christmas Eve at 4 p.m. if courier delivery is available in your area

[01:38:46.640 --> 01:38:52.720]   to put another human being through all that trouble if I'm having a bad day that's cheap
[01:38:52.720 --> 01:39:00.840]   well for nine dollars will they also pick it up in like 13 days and let me return it
[01:39:00.840 --> 01:39:06.520]   is it an Apple employee who does this or they go with a courier service what do I let

[01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:33.920]   23rd I wonder if there any other delivery options nine four nine five two let's let's
[01:39:33.920 --> 01:39:40.120]   view my options nope no courier to me gosh I'd love but maybe that's just the AirPod
[01:39:40.120 --> 01:39:44.520]   pro maybe that's because they just don't have them let's get some yeah there those are
[01:39:44.520 --> 01:39:50.840]   still those you can't get a month what if I had to have a clear case for the iPhone 11

[01:39:57.960 --> 01:40:06.000]   nine dollars free in your area what it says most metro area so maybe I think it it works
[01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:10.920]   in Sacramento but maybe your town is just too small for the free to our delivery Petaluma
[01:40:10.920 --> 01:40:20.240]   metro area for people who are like me notorious for shopping Christmas Eve this this might
[01:40:20.240 --> 01:40:27.000]   be a nice me at Homer Simpson yes that's that's something Leo that the last I can't remember
[01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:32.160]   how many years in a row Apple has their deadline to buy date and they make an announcement
[01:40:32.160 --> 01:40:36.720]   and they say if you want to get your Apple products in time for Christmas you know like
[01:40:36.720 --> 01:40:41.520]   the 18th or the 20th is the last time that you last day that you can order it to get
[01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:45.080]   it shipped in the fact that they've completely thrown that out the window and said guess
[01:40:45.080 --> 01:40:49.920]   what two hours even for nine dollars even if that's what you have to pay like I could
[01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:55.760]   shop for anybody who just at the last minute said oh I'm coming to visit for Christmas
[01:40:55.760 --> 01:41:01.000]   even if I can't get anything anywhere else I can get something from Apple I'm coming
[01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:05.840]   to visit for Christmas we're all coming on our way so I'm picking up Andy we're going
[01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:12.280]   to go right now that career on the way alright we don't have any ads today so I think we
[01:41:12.280 --> 01:41:19.800]   can skip right to your picks of the week let's start with Andy and I co perfect timing because
[01:41:19.800 --> 01:41:25.400]   for recording the day before before Christmas Eve so people will get this probably exactly
[01:41:25.400 --> 01:41:30.800]   the right time for my aunt one my favorite annual holiday traditions which is the Patrick
[01:41:30.800 --> 01:41:36.960]   Stewart's audiobook of a Christmas carol yeah we love that for decades he has been doing
[01:41:36.960 --> 01:41:43.400]   a one man show on in theaters doing his like abbreviated version of a Christmas carol doing
[01:41:43.400 --> 01:41:49.160]   all of the characters and all of the voices and I did to give you some idea the first
[01:41:49.160 --> 01:41:55.320]   time I heard this this was on cassette and then I bought it I had to buy it on CD then
[01:41:55.320 --> 01:42:00.280]   I bought it on on Audible no matter how you get it it is the one it really is one of the
[01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:04.800]   best versions of a Christmas carol that you can possibly experience it's the it's probably
[01:42:04.800 --> 01:42:10.560]   the person that taught me that the man of strong imagination oh shit we're both playing
[01:42:10.560 --> 01:42:15.320]   a voice of Scrooge's nephew who came upon him so quickly that this was the first intimation
[01:42:15.320 --> 01:42:21.840]   he had of his approach he had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and the frost
[01:42:21.840 --> 01:42:28.480]   this nephew of Scrooge's that he was all in a glow it's like a take in that this is this
[01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:33.560]   is what happens when like a performer works on his piece material for so long that they
[01:42:33.560 --> 01:42:39.320]   have thought about every single line every single word every single nuance and boy do
[01:42:39.320 --> 01:42:44.360]   you see it I gotta say if you go to Audible and search for Christmas carol you've got some
[01:42:44.360 --> 01:42:52.640]   good choices you can get if you want you can get Orson Wells Christmas Carol the radio dramatization
[01:42:52.640 --> 01:42:57.440]   that might be kind of let's play this little bit of that no the clock the undertaker and
[01:42:57.440 --> 01:43:03.320]   the chief morna Scrooge signed it and Scrooge's name was good upon change for anything he
[01:43:03.320 --> 01:43:08.480]   chose to put his hand line I'll bear more to you don't like that version I love the sound
[01:43:08.480 --> 01:43:14.880]   of that old radio sound ah it's beautiful I just think it's again it's the difference
[01:43:14.880 --> 01:43:21.200]   between Patrick Stewart a one of the freely truly great actor who this wasn't just hey
[01:43:21.200 --> 01:43:26.120]   Orson there if you're doing nothing next week in May could you read it could you read a part
[01:43:26.120 --> 01:43:29.160]   of this a Christmas Carol for us okay great yep I got time for that what's going to pay
[01:43:29.160 --> 01:43:33.720]   great they'll do it it is so is such a beautiful performance he's not just reading the book
[01:43:33.720 --> 01:43:39.720]   he really is performing it on stage and get all I gotta say is that he does all the kids
[01:43:39.720 --> 01:43:44.400]   voices to and he does the he does tiny Tim's voice and he puts himself like in this counter
[01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:50.400]   tenor voice exactly that if that ain't worth like the ten bucks I I don't know what I don't
[01:43:50.400 --> 01:43:56.600]   know how to talk about this one this is a dramatization featuring Sir Derek Jacoby
[01:43:56.600 --> 01:44:05.200]   his state hand at the grindstone draft reply to Mr. H. Pearson hard and sharp as flint
[01:44:05.200 --> 01:44:09.680]   I don't know that's that's pretty and that one's three and a half hours compared to the
[01:44:09.680 --> 01:44:16.360]   mere hour and forty seven minutes of mr. So is he a sir I think he is I think we have
[01:44:16.360 --> 01:44:22.820]   a column sir I think I think okay I will I will I will can see that there's ever like
[01:44:22.820 --> 01:44:29.820]   a version starring starring Patrick Stewart Derek Jacoby and Serene McKellen all right
[01:44:29.820 --> 01:44:33.820]   that will definitely that will get my attention really good Jim Dale is there one with Jim
[01:44:33.820 --> 01:44:39.500]   Dale I like Jim Dale he's my favorite there's a Tim Curry one there's a Leo and Andy one
[01:44:39.500 --> 01:44:46.620]   then Tissa excused knew he was dead of course he did I love the British voices I have to
[01:44:46.620 --> 01:44:50.740]   say I you know I got two audible credits maybe I'll get one of these or maybe I'll get two
[01:44:50.740 --> 01:44:55.820]   of them you can ever have too many Christmas Carol yes I just got these Patrick Stewart
[01:44:55.820 --> 01:45:01.300]   one thank you Andy I just I just that was such a great present I am so excited to list
[01:45:01.300 --> 01:45:05.100]   that great it's only ten dollars and forty six cents but if you have a credit you can
[01:45:05.100 --> 01:45:09.820]   just use your credit on it Laurie Gill your pick of the week yeah so following up with
[01:45:09.820 --> 01:45:14.500]   the Christmas tradition and horror movies at Christmas time which I love so much I'd like
[01:45:14.500 --> 01:45:22.500]   to recommend Game Over which is also called it's also called dial code Santa Claus and
[01:45:22.500 --> 01:45:29.300]   it's also called thirty six point fifteen code piano well it looks awful it's a it's
[01:45:29.300 --> 01:45:34.220]   a French movie it's kind of awful so let me put this out there really quickly there is
[01:45:34.220 --> 01:45:40.500]   a pretty horrific scene where they kill a dog not in real life but they depict the killing
[01:45:40.500 --> 01:45:46.220]   of a dog so if you're sensitive to animal stuff in movies that one's pretty horrific
[01:45:46.220 --> 01:45:52.300]   looking just to be clear this is a serial killer who dresses as Santa he's not well believe
[01:45:52.300 --> 01:45:57.980]   me there's much worse than this story line he's not a serial killer he's actually a child
[01:45:57.980 --> 01:46:03.100]   murderer oh much better but okay let me tell you though this what's so great about this
[01:46:03.100 --> 01:46:10.260]   movie is it was clearly made like with children in mind I think it actually won an award in
[01:46:10.260 --> 01:46:17.380]   some sort of like French children's movie festival or something because it was actually
[01:46:17.380 --> 01:46:23.780]   other than the dog killing scene it's really fun it's this kid who dresses like Rambo it's
[01:46:23.780 --> 01:46:30.260]   in the wind so it's a good news it's a happy ending and he's like trying to protect his
[01:46:30.260 --> 01:46:36.860]   old grandpa and it's and he's just this like great character on screen it not unlike rare
[01:46:36.860 --> 01:46:43.660]   exports it's this child who just like wins this the day and in terms of like what makes
[01:46:43.660 --> 01:46:52.580]   this fun to watch so game over game over man game over I think you can watch it on shutter
[01:46:52.580 --> 01:46:58.420]   TV and outside of that I actually have no idea where you can stream it because it's it's
[01:46:58.420 --> 01:47:02.780]   it's from nineteen ninety or nineteen eighty nine but it you couldn't really watch it anywhere
[01:47:02.780 --> 01:47:09.100]   I love until recently I love the original title is just pair no well thirty six thirty
[01:47:09.100 --> 01:47:15.940]   dot six is the thirty six fiend code part of the name I yes and I but it has like three
[01:47:15.940 --> 01:47:21.100]   different names that you a lot of I've seen it here no well I've seen it dial code Santa
[01:47:21.100 --> 01:47:26.060]   Claus and I've seen it game over and I've seen it thirty dot six fifteen but I've also seen
[01:47:26.060 --> 01:47:32.220]   it just thirty six fifteen so I don't know what it means all right yeah Renee might know
[01:47:32.220 --> 01:47:39.260]   more about the language pick pick you're picking your pick of the week so so my goal is to get
[01:47:39.260 --> 01:47:44.660]   you you know full fully back on Pokemon go for the holiday season Leo I was playing I know
[01:47:44.660 --> 01:47:50.340]   they've got we've got we can walk with our friends now they've got a whole buddy engine
[01:47:50.340 --> 01:47:56.340]   built so I've got mine I've got my little Mewtwo now as my walking with the dragon
[01:47:56.340 --> 01:48:01.740]   night oh that Mewtwo it's good it's so good and you can do these different things with
[01:48:01.740 --> 01:48:04.980]   the whoops are wrong I press their own button but you can do these different things with
[01:48:04.980 --> 01:48:09.540]   them to get hearts and increase their buddy level and as they go up for example if you
[01:48:09.540 --> 01:48:13.780]   throw a ball and you miss it he'll headbutt it back to try and get the catch for you and
[01:48:13.780 --> 01:48:17.180]   they'll bring you little gifts and they'll bring you items and they'll they'll increase
[01:48:17.180 --> 01:48:21.900]   their bonus damage and you can raise them up to even higher levels than previously and
[01:48:21.900 --> 01:48:26.100]   I kind of like that they're still investing in these sorts of things even now you can
[01:48:26.100 --> 01:48:30.020]   also play with other you can press a button and if you have someone else near you scan
[01:48:30.020 --> 01:48:34.860]   a code and you get this interactive augmented reality environment where both of your buddies
[01:48:34.860 --> 01:48:40.020]   are are there together in a sort of a shared virtual world which is something Apple announced
[01:48:40.020 --> 01:48:44.620]   I think the WWDC before this one and Lego was using to really good effect but we haven't
[01:48:44.620 --> 01:48:49.460]   seen a lot of other it's not especially on these kind of real world games where you have
[01:48:49.460 --> 01:48:54.700]   actual settings for things really implementing that part of the shared a our kit experience
[01:48:54.700 --> 01:48:58.220]   and it's just it's fun part of it is a little monotonous like you've got to do a lot of
[01:48:58.220 --> 01:49:02.620]   things to it that's my one problem with Pokemon go right now is there's so many things I think
[01:49:02.620 --> 01:49:06.700]   it would take an hour and a half if I did everything every day so I just pick and choose
[01:49:06.700 --> 01:49:10.220]   the things that are fun and new and novel and I've had a lot of fun with this and it's
[01:49:10.220 --> 01:49:14.460]   nice that you finally sort of have a better virtual world to run around in yeah I think
[01:49:14.460 --> 01:49:18.980]   the adding the buddies was this is this is these are probably some of the biggest changes
[01:49:18.980 --> 01:49:24.460]   to the game mechanics in a long time this is like a little yeah Tamagotchi now that yeah
[01:49:24.460 --> 01:49:29.980]   that you got a feed and play and battle and is all sorts of things do you know if do you
[01:49:29.980 --> 01:49:35.660]   know if this works with Pokeball plus it so this part doesn't need like there's no real
[01:49:35.660 --> 01:49:38.500]   Pokeball plus things that you would do with this because it's your you've already caught
[01:49:38.500 --> 01:49:42.740]   it but it does work with Pokeball plus for the rest of the game mechanic just the rest
[01:49:42.740 --> 01:49:48.860]   the other seven always worked with yeah yeah so I need to I need to actually I've been
[01:49:48.860 --> 01:49:54.020]   neglecting my poor dragonite he's starving so yeah you can press play and then fast feed
[01:49:54.020 --> 01:49:57.660]   that's what I've been doing now because it does not hold yeah if you press the bottom
[01:49:57.660 --> 01:50:01.900]   thing this dragonite's so big I don't have room for it yeah so there we go we're gonna
[01:50:01.900 --> 01:50:06.820]   just give them all give them a I got all those puffins are great they make they make him
[01:50:06.820 --> 01:50:14.740]   love you so I'm gonna buy a double yeah yeah double yeah let's feed him a puffin come on
[01:50:14.740 --> 01:50:19.980]   you give him oh crap do it I lose over you got to throw it Leo there you go now watch
[01:50:19.980 --> 01:50:27.380]   you get in he's gonna fall in love with me more oh my dragonite my buddy my buddy Opal
[01:50:27.380 --> 01:50:32.820]   buddy so now he's he's walking with me right because I gave him as many treats as you have
[01:50:32.820 --> 01:50:39.020]   the double hand where is he where why is the oh there he is there he is a nice how you
[01:50:39.020 --> 01:50:43.900]   don't know what is so cute it's really it has that it adds a lot can he fight with you
[01:50:43.900 --> 01:50:48.980]   yeah it looks amazing on the pixel for at 60 Hertz until the light changes slightly and
[01:50:48.980 --> 01:50:53.380]   it drops back to 30 Hertz turn on developer mode you can make it permanent I know yeah
[01:50:53.380 --> 01:50:59.620]   it's worth doing what is that I've never seen this a wild that's a little oh yeah there's
[01:50:59.620 --> 01:51:07.420]   a blue one in Europe and a pink one here got some catching to do Pokemon got to catch
[01:51:07.420 --> 01:51:12.220]   a lot of events for for the holidays so there's gonna be a ton of fun stuff going on they have
[01:51:12.220 --> 01:51:16.940]   really added to this game they're keeping alive and it's too bad that Harry Potter I
[01:51:16.940 --> 01:51:21.140]   haven't even looked to see if Wizards unite has anything new but it's been very didn't
[01:51:21.140 --> 01:51:24.860]   do as well because I think they leaned into the like the cupcake factory mechanics like
[01:51:24.860 --> 01:51:29.020]   when some people love time management games but it's it's hard to graph that onto a game
[01:51:29.020 --> 01:51:34.980]   where people are out and walking it just makes you stop boring me and my dragon I walk around
[01:51:34.980 --> 01:51:42.260]   the Twit Studios all right my pick is from Patrick Wardle we were talking about him earlier
[01:51:42.260 --> 01:51:49.500]   former tame hacker at the NSA he's also a Mac guy and you might know the name objective
[01:51:49.500 --> 01:51:57.900]   dash see dot com that's his website and he has a lot of really cool products including
[01:51:57.900 --> 01:52:03.780]   one that I would highly recommend called Lulu you're probably familiar with shields up which
[01:52:03.780 --> 01:52:09.820]   is a long standing kind of reverse firewall for the Macintosh that you run and it keeps
[01:52:09.820 --> 01:52:16.780]   an idea eye on outbound traffic and asks your permission Lulu is his open source version
[01:52:16.780 --> 01:52:23.180]   and same functionality but it is free and I have to say it's a little easier to use because
[01:52:23.180 --> 01:52:26.900]   when you first installed it says look you just want to assume that everything you've already
[01:52:26.900 --> 01:52:33.900]   got installed is okay and you know I say yes only new things now and so that's a very handy
[01:52:33.900 --> 01:52:39.900]   tool and I think it's been very useful without being overbearingly annoying so every time
[01:52:39.900 --> 01:52:44.780]   I install a new app or I run an app that has it's asking for new permissions Lulu will
[01:52:44.780 --> 01:52:49.980]   pop up and say hey you know you know Safari is trying to access the internet is that okay
[01:52:49.980 --> 01:52:55.940]   and you can you can give permission so this is like Lulu I mean it's like shields up but
[01:52:55.940 --> 01:53:01.340]   it's I think it's newer and it's really great Lulu highly recommended I did run another
[01:53:01.340 --> 01:53:07.460]   one of his programs I think it was called oversight no that wasn't it there's quite
[01:53:07.460 --> 01:53:13.980]   a few ran one and I had to I had problems rebooting I'm not sure if that was something
[01:53:13.980 --> 01:53:22.460]   I did wrong but certainly Lulu is completely locked down was that that's what it was and
[01:53:22.460 --> 01:53:31.580]   it was just a little script that changes settings on the Mac to make it secure and after I ran
[01:53:31.580 --> 01:53:37.020]   that I couldn't reboot so I don't know what happened there I'll do some examination but
[01:53:37.020 --> 01:53:41.620]   it's a really interesting idea and you can certainly download it and these are all free
[01:53:41.620 --> 01:53:49.500]   and run it just to find out which functionality is enabled and you know probably don't toggle
[01:53:49.500 --> 01:53:54.060]   everything read these and you'll see some of the things you can do to harden your Mac
[01:53:54.060 --> 01:54:00.420]   this is basically a Mac hardening tool but I like Lulu and I haven't had any problems
[01:54:00.420 --> 01:54:04.620]   with it's really a wonderful product Patrick Wardle does really nice security tools and
[01:54:04.620 --> 01:54:10.140]   they're absolutely free although you can support him on patreon and I would recommend
[01:54:10.140 --> 01:54:19.900]   that folks has everybody done their picks are you all ready for a Festivus baking tonight
[01:54:19.900 --> 01:54:25.980]   tonight today you get to air your grievances and the feats of strength are coming up there's

[01:56:03.060 --> 01:56:09.740]   yeah oh smart man that's one of the nice things about like temporarily being on crutches during
[01:56:09.740 --> 01:56:15.140]   the holidays oh well you know I would as normal just go visit everybody on eight or nine different
[01:56:15.140 --> 01:56:21.820]   houses all across New England but O'Darn did I miss something why are you on crutches oh it's it's
[01:56:21.820 --> 01:56:27.660]   nothing it's like I tweak my leg a little bit during my last trip to New York and it's it's
[01:56:27.660 --> 01:56:33.500]   everything's it's just like one of those weird things where some for some reason some some some
[01:56:33.500 --> 01:56:39.260]   nerve gets pressed yeah and it just it's getting better like month by month and it should be okay
[01:56:39.260 --> 01:56:45.420]   all right so nothing nothing permanently set up as I've been telling people I'm on the crutches
[01:56:45.420 --> 01:56:50.140]   long enough that I put anti-reflective tape on them not so long that I decided to paint them a
[01:56:50.140 --> 01:56:56.860]   more interesting color well it's been a pleasure Andy there's been a great year with you and I
