[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.160]   And boy, we are back to the Mac.
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.720]   It's so exciting joining me right now.
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.240]   Baby, we're back, baby.
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.200]   Alex Lindsey, Andy and Naco, both of whom with me,
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.240]   we're just watching our live coverage of Apple's event
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.320]   at the Town Hall in Cupertino.
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.560]   But you know who's there right now?
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.960]   Becky Worley.
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.600]   And we're going to go via FaceTime to the demo room,
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.600]   upstairs from the Town Hall in Cupertino, where
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.000]   Becky has a first hand look at the new MacBook Air.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.960]   So we'll start with that.
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:02.960]   Let me plug you in.
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.200]   Go ahead, Becky.
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.040]   Hey, guys.
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.920]   Hello.
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:07.520]   Hello.
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.000]   Hello.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.160]   We are in what I like to call the magic room.
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.480]   We've got all these journalists here behind me
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.680]   looking at the new products.
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.080]   And I have to say, this is the first time
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.720]   I'm doing a live shot via FaceTime.
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.160]   So I think that's monumental in its own right.
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.160]   But big news coming in today from the Apple announcement.
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.920]   Let's start with FaceTime, the way that Steve Jobs did.
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.960]   FaceTime for the Mac is now available.
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:30.880]   I tried it out.
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.240]   It works.
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.040]   You will just use your Apple ID and make calls to people
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.920]   who have FaceTime enabled mobile devices.
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.640]   We also heard the announcement that there
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.800]   is a new Mac OS, Lion.
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.680]   I'm sure Leo and the guys will get into that.
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.760]   But I want to give you a full visual demo of the new MacBook
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:48.120]   Air.
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.040]   This thing is teeny, teeny, tiny.
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.640]   I'm going to switch my camera here and show you, starting out.
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.520]   This is the 13-inch model.
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.560]   Looks like it is just a seemingly thin.
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.560]   At its thickest, it is 0.86 inches thick.
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.360]   It weighs 2 point something pounds.
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.360]   Really, really light.
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.480]   The headline on this one, 7-hour battery life.
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.440]   That's when it's on.
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.880]   It says what Steve said was that it also has 30 days of standby
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.720]   time, which is pretty unbelievable.
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.200]   Look to the inside of this thing.
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.280]   It has an on-board flash.
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.960]   It has a ton of battery.
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.280]   The only thing that was really interesting to me
[00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:38.040]   as I've been able to dig in here is looking at some of the specs.
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.400]   I think what I really found interesting
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.720]   was that these guys have only a pretty-- what is it?
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.520]   1.6 processor, 1.6 gigahertz processor.
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.440]   But the headline is the size, the weight.
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.520]   There's an 13-inch model.
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.920]   And then right next to it here, I'll put the 11-inch model
[00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.880]   so you can see how they compare side by side.
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.920]   And really, what we're talking about here, guys,
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.800]   are Apple netbooks.
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.480]   Price start at $9.99 for this.
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.160]   Then it bumps up to $11.99.
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.800]   You want to add more storage memory.
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.040]   Then that's going to cost you a couple hundred more.
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.640]   I'll let the guys get into the details on that.
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.920]   I'm going to throw it back to you, Leo.
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.200]   And you just all keep shooting the pictures.
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.320]   And I'll take you over and show you some of the other things
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.280]   here as I listen in.
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.640]   And you guys can see what we're seeing.
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:26.280]   Thank you, Becky.
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.680]   I have to unplug Becky because she doesn't work
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.240]   that she can hear us at the same time as we can hear her.
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.320]   So she's going to continue to show us pictures.
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:34.880]   We're on an iPhone 4.
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.680]   Although I am downloading FaceTime,
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.720]   the FaceTime for the desktop is downloading now.
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.640]   Let's go through, guys, what was announced today.
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:47.720]   And we'll keep looking at pictures as we talk of this MacBook Air.
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.400]   In fact, as long as we've got the MacBook Air on the screen,
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.240]   let's go backwards and start with the MacBook Air.
[00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.480]   That was the one more thing that Steve Jobs announced today.
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.280]   And it was heavily rumored.
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.560]   Andy Naco, what's your thoughts on these new MacBook Airs?
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:02.760]   That's a very big deal.
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.360]   I mean, last week, the week before I was talking to a friend
[00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.640]   and he was asking me about rumors about the MacBook Air.
[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.240]   And I had to tell him that, well, at that point,
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.640]   we hadn't really seen anything really substantive.
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.840]   And MacBook Air was really on that bubble, wasn't it?
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.400]   Where it could have been one of those products where they tried it
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.120]   and never made it big splash and was prepared to fade away.
[00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.800]   Which is why when it started becoming hard to get your hands on one,
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.520]   I was wondering, does this mean they're coming up with a new model?
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.960]   Or does it mean that they're just coming to determine yet?
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.080]   But it really does show that Apple is one big company.
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.760]   They're not a company consisting of eight or nine or 10 different divisions
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.440]   that don't talk to each other.
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:43.160]   So this really is the idea of let's build the first MacBook
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.440]   that has been informed by everything that we learned by building the iPad.
[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:51.000]   The biggest feature, though, above everything, no matter what you're going to talk about,
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.440]   is going to be the price tag.
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.600]   999 bucks, that instantly makes the MacBook Air credible,
[00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.680]   which is something that the previous edition really wasn't.
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:05.480]   I mean, if you're going to choose between spending $1,600 for an absolutely kick-ass MacBook Pro
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.560]   or the same amount of money for a nice, thinner, lighter version of the same thing,
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.760]   but with a much weaker processor, only one USB port,
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.520]   every single disadvantage you can possibly think of, it was a soccer bet.
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:21.560]   But for $9.99, there are a lot of people who want an iPad that runs Mac software,
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.600]   and I think that the MacBook Air is going to be the machine that they buy.
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:28.840]   If you look at the range of prices, your right starts at $9.99, goes up to $15.99.
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:29.640]   There are two models.
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:34.040]   There's an 11-inch and there's a 13-inch, the 11-inch,
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:38.840]   1.4 gigahertz core 2 processor, two gigs of memory, 64 gig flash storage,
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:45.400]   NVIDIA GeForce 320M graphics, and a 64 gig flash drive, as I mentioned, 999.
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:46.760]   These are all available now.
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:52.920]   The, for 128 gig, same specs, 1199s for a bigger flash drive.
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:58.360]   If you move to the 13-inch, you can go to a 1.86 gigahertz core 2 processor.
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:03.720]   Flash storage choices in the 13-inch or 128 gigs and 256 gigs,
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:07.400]   but the prices are considerably more, 12.99, 15.99.
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:12.200]   Still, these are lower, aren't they, Andy, than the last MacBook Air?
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.760]   I was very surprised that they hit the 999 price point.
[00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:15.880]   It's very low.
[00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:20.440]   Well, it's just that it's a direct competitor now to the cheapest MacBook nothing.
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:26.280]   They are really giving consumers a choice between, you can have small, thin light,
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:29.640]   you will sacrifice some hard disk space, you will also not get an optical drive,
[00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:33.320]   or for the exact same amount of money, we will give you a more conventional notebook.
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:36.440]   I would have thought that they would have made the lowest price of the MacBook Air,
[00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:41.880]   maybe 1100, 1200 bucks, just to give it a little bit of space in pricing.
[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:43.560]   But that is a very interesting move.
[00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:48.520]   It really makes me even more interested to see what the next MacBook after this is going to be.
[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:55.320]   Yeah. The screen resolutions are comparable to the 13-inch on the 11-inch.
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:08:00.040]   So you really could get almost an identical machine to the white MacBook
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:04.280]   in terms of processor power. It's a little lower processor power.
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.920]   It's a 1.4 gigahertz instead of 2.4 gigahertz.
[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:12.680]   Storage is a little bit lower, but you do get the same 320M graphics and the same screen resolution.
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:19.400]   At the same price, you have to say, you think would it phase out the MacBook nothing as you call it?
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:22.200]   I don't think it would phase that up because there are too many people who are still kind of
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:25.800]   addicted to the idea of having massive storage ports.
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:30.440]   Well, not just a massive storage, massive ports, and also having that drive slot.
[00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:39.480]   One of my worthy and deserving aunts, one of the reasons why she really wanted to get the
[00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:44.360]   the real MacBook was that it would allow her to play DVDs when she goes off on her little trips.
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:48.840]   So I don't think that my aunt would be more interested in the MacBook Air that would force
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:52.360]   her to learn about MP4 rather than these lovely disks that she plays at home.
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:56.600]   You can upgrade the 11 inch for a little more money to 1.6 gigahertz, but it's still a fairly
[00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:02.120]   slow processor. Is that too slow? I'm sure it's going to be fast enough to the big deal is that
[00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:07.240]   it has the same accelerated Nvidia graphics chip as the regular MacBook. So in terms of the things
[00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:12.280]   that people will really notice speed for playback of video and the video that's embedded into web
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:16.360]   pages, I don't think they'll notice any sort of a difference. And the people who are more interested
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:21.640]   in high performance stuff like aperture editing, iMovie editing, they're probably not going to
[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:25.400]   be thrown by the amount of storage anyway. So I don't think that's going to be a real factor for them.
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:29.720]   Looks like Becky's trying to go over and talk to Steve Jobs. Let's listen in and see what's going on
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:39.720]   as Becky approaches Steve Jobs here. I like it Steve. Steve's making the rounds, talking to the people.
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:48.280]   This is by the way a first for us a FaceTime call to the Apple campus. I do have FaceTime
[00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:53.400]   working on the desktop. You know I think that I do think that there's a question whether the Mac
[00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:59.240]   looks makes sense. Hold on, hold on, hold on. She's talking to Steve. Say that again.
[00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:05.560]   You like it a lot? It fits in the bag and you take it with you everywhere?
[00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:16.520]   Can I ask you one other question? Does the fact that we now have FaceTime just on the Mac mean we
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:23.160]   won't see APIs for other video conferencing? Okay, just checking.
[00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:30.760]   There you go. I think that's our first on Twit Live, an actual conversation with Steve Jobs.
[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:36.600]   Well done, Becky Worley. That's pretty exciting. Thank you Becky for getting that. That's amazing.
[00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:41.000]   Well done. Oh, I hope I didn't lose her here.
[00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:50.840]   The iPhone has failed me just in the nick of time. Let's see if we get her back. There she is.
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:11:01.800]   Awesome. Somebody else is calling. I hate you whoever you are you lose.
[00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:09.560]   So there you go. You still heard Steve Jobs deny that the fact that FaceTime desktop is now available
[00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:18.680]   on the desktop. Here's Becky. Sorry about that Becky. Let me start the FaceTime up again
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:23.880]   and we can talk to you. Nice scoop getting Steve Jobs and I'm glad you asked him about FaceTime
[00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:30.920]   open FaceTime. Yeah, that was the one thing that really struck me was the FaceTime issue.
[00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:34.920]   Maybe it's just my own personal bugaboo because I really want to FaceTime with my kids when I'm on
[00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:40.120]   the road and they just have a computer at home. But I just I thought that we'd heard that those
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:44.760]   APIs would open up later. I mean that was what I kind of thought might come down after we heard
[00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:50.440]   about it just being for Mac. But there was no announcement and as Steve said they said no such
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:54.920]   thing and I don't know if we'll ever see those or if this is just a great branding opportunity for
[00:11:54.920 --> 00:12:01.080]   them to keep FaceTime to Mac exclusive and proprietary that certainly is an incentive for iPhone users
[00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:07.400]   to think about their next computer purchase being a Mac. But he seems really happy with the Mac
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:13.400]   book airs and I would say we have definitely scooped something by doing the first interview via FaceTime.
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:18.840]   First FaceTime interview. That's awesome. Well done Becky Warley. We'll see you back here in
[00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:26.680]   just a little bit. People keep calling me. Thank you Becky Warley. Really appreciate. Well done.
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:31.400]   Becky's going to come back and we'll cover this on TNT and
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:36.280]   versus as soon as you show a phone people feel like they should just call it because
[00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:40.360]   hey that's what you do with phones. We haven't heard from you Alex Lindsay. What do you think
[00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:47.000]   about what we've seen so far? Well I think that the Mac book you know I do think that that is in
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.880]   danger. I think that you know if you want more storage if you want more connections I think
[00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:57.160]   Apple is going to want you to get a MacBook Pro even the small 13 inch. You know Apple has been
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:04.680]   very very good at doing a great, a great addition on set of products all the way through and I think
[00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:10.040]   what you're seeing right now is an overlap between two different pieces and I'd be surprised if we
[00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:17.800]   see that continue you know through the end of 2011. So the MacBook Air the biggest one more thing
[00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:23.880]   and and kind of a surprise I don't think anybody predicted there'd be two models an 11 inch and a
[00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:29.880]   13 inch model. The 11 inch is very small and light and available now. I've actually sent a
[00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:35.960]   jammer bee. He's calling around to see if they're in the stores. He says there aren't any in the
[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:43.000]   stores nearby. I was going to send him running out the door. You know I guess the the big choice is
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:50.920]   storage. That's the question is can you live with 64 gigabytes of storage. Alex 28 or 256.
[00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:53.800]   Yeah but I mean if you want the 999 you're going 64.
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:58.120]   Well and I think my you know I keep on looking at because while it's not necessarily a great
[00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:03.960]   solution for me I'm really a MacBook Pro user and I need to be. I can definitely see the way the
[00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:10.600]   way my wife uses her laptop the the small 999 would be perfect. I mean she generates about three megabytes
[00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:16.280]   of content a year. Yeah yeah so yeah easy for somebody just as Docs.
[00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:22.680]   Yeah I mean also I've been hearing from a lot of people who were interested in the in the MacBook
[00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:27.720]   Air rumors because that is exactly what I've been hearing from people that I would go for an
[00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:33.080]   iPad immediately because I want something that lightweight and that that durable but I need
[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:36.920]   something that will run a certain class of software that's not available on the iPad yet.
[00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:40.840]   So I know at least one person who I'm sure already has his order placed in because
[00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:44.520]   this person is a screenwriter and you can't really do screenwriting on the iPad.
[00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:48.760]   Interesting you can upgrade to four gigs on even the least expensive one.
[00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:55.000]   Yeah but that's certainly enough for the sort I really think that Apple is going to spend the
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.680]   next couple of weeks making sure that they're very clear on the sort of person who is correct
[00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:02.680]   for the MacBook Air as opposed to the people who shouldn't be distracted from their original
[00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:07.800]   intent of buying a more traditional notebook. Right all right well let's now that we've
[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:13.720]   started at the end let's go back to the beginning the the event started this morning at 10 a.m.
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:20.920]   Pacific Time with Steve Jobs walking on to the stage and almost immediately introducing Phil
[00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:27.560]   Schiller who talked about well a lot of numbers these are numbers we heard on Monday with the
[00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:32.200]   Apple call the Apple conference call with analysts a very successful
[00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:35.880]   quarter for Apple yes.
[00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:42.200]   Yeah absolutely they were they made they did a good job of making the point that of how much
[00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:47.080]   business that they do with the Mac what they're they're trying to also make the point that
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:52.360]   if you look at them as a company that makes computers and all kinds of shapes and sizes that
[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:56.520]   they are really one of the titans of the whole computer market and that as such their market
[00:15:56.520 --> 00:16:00.680]   share is definitely increasing but that really is kind of the way that they open all these things
[00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:04.200]   they always throw the numbers at us while we know that we're not going to leave the room right.
[00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:09.960]   Right I think that Apple Apple wanted to make sure to test the new cash printing presses
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:16.360]   and it turned out they are they are they're working 14.1 million iPhones sold in this quarter the most
[00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:21.720]   they've over sold in any quarter the iPhone 4 unqualified success better than this quarter last
[00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:28.680]   year better than the 3GS better than anything I mean really it better by the way most importantly
[00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:33.240]   than Blackberry's rim it's the first time apples beat rim in quarterly sales.
[00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:42.040]   Yeah I mean it's really it really does make the CEO of of rim wish that he might have held
[00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:46.440]   off for a couple of days before saying oh he's just a people don't like the Apple anyway they're
[00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:51.080]   not in their control with the Apple universe but yeah there was there was it was a really
[00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:55.800]   dense information dump I'm looking at my own line blog right now just to see the notes that I took
[00:16:55.800 --> 00:17:01.240]   at that point but they really wanted to make the point that numbers it's not about Wiffle Dust and
[00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:06.600]   magical magical fairies with with Apple products that the numbers show that they are selling a
[00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:11.400]   hell of a lot of things to a whole lot of people. They by the way I forgot to mention the first
[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:17.400]   thing Steve said is please turn off your phones yeah he did not say turn off your my
[00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:22.040]   devices turn off your Wi-Fi devices and I guess he didn't need to this time they weren't
[00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:27.720]   demonstrating anything like that and the FaceTime demo on on both the desktop and the phone worked
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:31.720]   just fine. Yeah I think I think that I think Town Hall is actually a big parody cage I think
[00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:35.960]   that's the reason why they chose that wallpaper it has copper mesh built back in every single square
[00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:47.080]   edge. Then on to not a surprise at all iLife 2011 iLife 11 big updates primarily well I guess all
[00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:53.640]   three applications got updated iMovie iPhoto and GarageBand let's start with iPhoto and he
[00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:57.720]   thoughts about the updates there it looked like full screen was the big story there. That's right
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:00.840]   that's that's the big deal they are definitely trying to make sure that there's going to be
[00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:06.600]   some intersection between iOS and Mac OS people who are wondering if iOS will ever come to the
[00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:10.920]   desktop I think we now have seen what Apple has planned that they're simply going to take the
[00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:17.640]   parts of iOS that seem to translate well to the desktop and and and move it in so we'll see more
[00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:23.400]   about that later when we talk about later things but so now there is a very iPad like full screen
[00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:27.560]   photo view that you can switch in and out of it looks like a really good way of navigating between
[00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:32.440]   lots of different albums lots of different lots of different places also the the the the map they
[00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:36.680]   they've they've spent a lot of time demonstrating their new map feature because I think possibly
[00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:40.600]   because it makes such a great demo when you have a background that is always an interactive map
[00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:45.880]   that you can sort of it's kind of like tracing Jason Bourne if you're the CIA you'll see the photo
[00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:50.680]   sort of race along maps with little pinpoints over this really nicely rotating globe and
[00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:56.840]   interactive ghoul street view sort of thing so they spent a lot of time on that because it is
[00:18:56.840 --> 00:19:01.720]   really a cool demo I have downloaded the FaceTime app and it does require it looks like snow leopard
[00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:07.640]   to run so it's complaining to me that I don't have a security update that I can't get so I suspect
[00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:12.440]   that that's because I'm running leopard not snow leopard the new airs will not be an apple stores
[00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:16.120]   according to the apple stores we've called later until later this week but they do say call first
[00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:22.120]   thing tomorrow morning I was able to order online and I'll say one to three business days I will
[00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:28.440]   have mine tomorrow morning how do you get that so fast I'm I'm me
[00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:34.280]   oh yeah I got I got the phone call yesterday where uh which was off if I'm getting something
[00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:38.920]   like day and day this is usually that call saying we cannot confirm the news that's going to be
[00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:44.680]   released on Wednesday however I just on a curiosity will you be home to sign for a package on Thursday
[00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:49.720]   morning because we have some printed press materials that we want to picture we mailed yeah it's just
[00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:54.840]   a FedEx pack you know and we want you to be home personally designed for those printed materials
[00:19:54.840 --> 00:20:01.960]   yeah so uh let's see what else now you were very interested I think uh Alex Lindsey in the
[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:08.840]   new features in iMovie well I think that I don't know if I'm I'm totally interested in them I mean
[00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:12.840]   I don't know how much I would use the a lot of the new features but I can definitely see how
[00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:19.080]   apple would be you know what a user of iMovie might want to put together this little road trip and
[00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:23.400]   they put together a little music video or a trailer is a trailer was kind of an interesting
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:28.120]   feature I don't know I mean it did take him a fairly long time some of the bloggers were
[00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:31.720]   grousing and how long it was taking for him to put him to the trailer you got to put that in
[00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:36.760]   perspective of putting those graphics together I do this for a living and putting those graphics
[00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:41.240]   together at that quality would take a lot longer than what he did so you know being able to do
[00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:44.280]   something on a flight home I always think of it if you had a two and a half hour flight home and
[00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:49.160]   you had a bunch of video could you throw those SD cards in digitize you know pull it all into iMovie
[00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:54.200]   and make a music video or a little trailer to send to your your family and friends and I think
[00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:57.560]   you could definitely do that I mean he did it in minutes and that would have taken you know that's
[00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:02.840]   a weekend of work on in Final Cut and Motion you know a lot more control and a lot more specialization
[00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:07.160]   I think that I still think that what Apple needs to do is start opening some of this stuff up let
[00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:12.520]   third-party developers really build lots of those templates and let people get much more individualized
[00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:18.200]   you know experience there's still aren't tools to do that not really no Apple I think part of it is
[00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:22.680]   they they just like to it's it's more they just like to develop the way they like to develop they
[00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:27.560]   they want to be they don't want to have to think about third-party developers and compatibility
[00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:30.200]   and everything else they just want to keep on moving down the path and they don't want to deal
[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:34.520]   with it and I think that's partially why they why they do that interesting but Alex the question
[00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:40.040]   I wanted to ask is does that trailer wizard seem like a flexible sort of feature it seems like a
[00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:46.040]   really cool way to make fun movie trailer versions of your videos all the way down to that that that
[00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:50.600]   that square of high definition micro blob text with every single person every single name of
[00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:55.400]   social with a video included in that but seem like I was surprised that the demo went for so long
[00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:59.800]   because it seemed like just a fun little thing they threw in just to make things more interesting
[00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:04.840]   they seem to be giving it so much time that they thought that this will rip we feel is we've listened
[00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:11.240]   to users and this will revolutionize the way we share videos in the 21st century you know being
[00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:15.160]   able to edit more effectively an audio I think was more revolutionary for the average user who
[00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:18.920]   needs to do stuff you know i'm moving that has been a little bit difficult and that's definitely
[00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:23.640]   improved I think that this is a cool feature I mean I think people will I think there's a lot of
[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:27.800]   people that will play with it that use iMovie you know if you think that this isn't enough then
[00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:36.520]   you probably should be using Final Cut Express. Do you think that this is approaching Final Cut
[00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:41.240]   Express we talked on our live coverage that it looked like there was no constraint on the
[00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:46.200]   developers for the iLife package to avoid professional features? Well I think that they're using
[00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:52.440]   whatever technology whatever features whatever the apple has in its in its big trust its brain
[00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:57.720]   trust of all the stuff they bought from shake to chalice to Final Cut and all these other things
[00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:03.080]   so they in logic so they have full access to that but I do think that they limit what they do to
[00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:07.640]   what can they do in real time I mean in Final Cut there's a lot of things that you'll do and then
[00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:12.040]   hit render and wait so what can you do in real time and what can you what is going to be easy for
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:16.040]   the user how do we not add a ton of buttons and dials and I think that that's those are things that
[00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:20.840]   are you know way heavy on the on the team as they as they start to put that stuff together and
[00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:24.840]   and what limits what they you know what they put into it and it's very slow process but I do see
[00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:29.960]   iMovie becoming much more full featured over time but very focused on the consumer and not on the
[00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:37.240]   professional. We'll continue with our coverage of Apple's big announcement today the new iLife
[00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:41.080]   package we're going to talk a little bit about the new GarageBand features we will talk about
[00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:46.520]   FaceTime and do more on the MacBook Air and just a bit Annie and Akko is here Alex Lindsey as well
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:53.800]   you're watching Macbreak Weekly brought to you today by Carbonite.com yes Carbonite is a Mac as
[00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:59.240]   well as a Windows program and is a great way to back up in fact if you are not yet backing up
[00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:03.320]   automatically to the cloud you better start thinking about it because you know it's great to back up
[00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:10.040]   to a CD or DVD or a thumb driver an external drive I hope you're at least doing that much
[00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:13.640]   but remember if your media is sitting right next to the computer and somebody comes and steals a
[00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:18.520]   computer or a fire hits your house or a tornado or earthquake you could lose everything at the
[00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:25.080]   same time as you lose the originals that's why I'm a big fan of a Carbonite Carbonite is back up
[00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:29.800]   into the cloud where you can access your files anywhere you don't even need to have the same
[00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:34.840]   computer you just log on to your Carbonite account from any computer or use the free iPhone app
[00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:40.120]   there's a free BlackBerry app too let's you access your data it's always there it's completely safe
[00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:45.640]   because your files are encrypted twice they use SSL so you can even use an open axe you know
[00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:49.960]   Carbonite is always backing up so if you get to a Starbucks and open access point it'll it'll
[00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:53.320]   it'll use that internet connection if you're not using it to back up but you don't have to worry
[00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:58.280]   about it because it's SSL it's encrypted and if you want more you can further encrypt using AES
[00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:06.200]   256 so you have absolute privacy unlimited backup everything on your internal drive just $55 a year
[00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:11.960]   15 cents a day it's worth it for the peace of mind believe me easy to use automatic very easy to

[00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:43.640]   today and there was there was quite a bit were you surprised either of you by what Apple announced
[00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:47.240]   it seemed like the rumors were pretty strong that this is exactly what they were going to do is
[00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:50.920]   there anything that you were surprised to hear about or anything you wanted to hear about you
[00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:56.280]   didn't hear about Alex. You know I think that the fact that they were showing so much of an iOS
[00:25:56.280 --> 00:26:01.960]   so early I mean I we I kind of have expected iOS to be the next you know OS 10 I didn't expect to
[00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:07.720]   see it this year so I think that was the you know how far they're going. Well you won't see it you
[00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:14.440]   won't see it till summer of next year. Yeah just the just the fact that they showed it you mean yeah
[00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:18.440]   Apple doesn't usually show anything that far in advance or very little that far in advance the
[00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:23.480]   fact that they did that I thought was you know that was surprising. Any surprises to you Alex I
[00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:30.040]   mean Andy. I wasn't quite so surprised only because they're now in the part of their development where
[00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:35.480]   so much of the things they're going to do with the OS requires a long head start for developers where
[00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:40.280]   just giving seating it to developers three months before release will no longer do they really need
[00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:45.000]   to get people on board quickly. So that really wasn't a big surprise to me. The bigger surprise
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:50.280]   was that they didn't show off anything in the operating system that wasn't directly related
[00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:56.760]   to that integration between or that the the the sort of cross pollination between iOS
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:27:01.640]   and the Mac OS as a matter of fact there's a new terminology that I'm scrolling back to find
[00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:08.920]   where do they say now they're referring to as the virtuous circle that the Mac OS created iOS
[00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:14.520]   and now the iOS inspires new features for for Mac OS again. So really that was the entire
[00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:19.800]   message that they're really trying to make sure that the Mac OS is not forgotten that hopefully some
[00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:26.280]   of the some of the sloppy seconds or some of the halo effect from iOS will start to really get
[00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:29.880]   people excited about the Mac again and about time to because it's been a couple years since they've
[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:35.080]   done anything to really grab people's attention. Let's continue on with our look at iLife. So
[00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:40.680]   incremental improvements in iPhoto somewhat more significant improvements particularly to
[00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:46.680]   audio editing in iMovie but garage band seemed like it got a lot more new stuff and by the way I
[00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:50.680]   don't know is iWeb dead or are they just not updating it apparently it is included.
[00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:55.800]   Yeah it was one of the icons that was there iDVD was also one of the icons that was there.
[00:27:55.800 --> 00:28:00.120]   I see it and I thought that was gone and right that's both of those were definitely marked for
[00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:05.640]   death by the rumor mill so so I don't know this stay of execution the fact go ahead.
[00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:08.680]   I just think I think that they're done with them I don't think we're seeing that we're going to
[00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:12.760]   see any development on them I think that they're they're focusing on other things if they didn't
[00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:18.680]   update them on this round I don't think that they're going to I think that those are those
[00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:24.040]   apps are probably going to stay the way that they are. The $49 for the upgrade and it is an
[00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:28.040]   upgrade because there's nobody with a Mac that doesn't buy it doesn't have iLife at this point
[00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:36.120]   and $79 for the family pack which I think in the past has been five licenses I don't know I'll
[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:42.120]   have to check on that so just running down the new features that we mentioned earlier in the iPhoto
[00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:48.440]   full screen views for faces places events and albums email photos using apple themes
[00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:56.200]   share photos with Facebook and by the way see the comments from Facebook back in iPhoto very
[00:28:56.200 --> 00:29:02.200]   interesting integration into Facebook there pro quality books cards letter press photo cards
[00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:09.960]   new slideshow themes iMovie as we mentioned movie trailers audio editing controls visual effects
[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:15.000]   one click visual effects like slow motion dream haze I like the one click instant replay it's not
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:23.720]   something you couldn't do without it but it's in there I really love the audio editing because
[00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:28.840]   some the my biggest complaint about the lack of frame be able to edit down to the very frame that
[00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:33.240]   you need is that sometimes you just want to cut to something right before someone says something
[00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:38.360]   or right before something happens and the fact that you just have the audio stream just overlay
[00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:42.920]   it upon that clip so you can say okay that peak right there is where the bat hits the ball so I'm
[00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:47.000]   going to make that cut start right before that clip right there and you can it seems as though
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:50.520]   it's an easy way to get things synchronized like that just really really carefully
[00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:57.080]   by the way customers and this includes me who purchased a new Mac computer or refurbished apple
[00:29:57.080 --> 00:30:01.320]   certified refurbished from the apple online store between october 1st and october 19th
[00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:07.640]   can upgrade to iLife 11 for 699 so thank you apple you saved me some money people finder in iMovie
[00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:11.240]   that's kind of interesting they've had it in iPhoto for a while face recognition
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:16.520]   now you've got it with video and here's an interesting addition you can now upload you could
[00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:21.080]   always upload a youtube I don't remember if you can upload to facebook in the past but you can now
[00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:26.520]   do facebook youtube vimeo that's new and cnn I report and then it says and more I'm not sure what
[00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:32.520]   the and more is but isn't that hugely interesting though the the way that they articulated face
[00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:38.520]   recognition wasn't show me all clips that have my aunt mimzy in it it was I need a two shot show
[00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:42.440]   me all these clips that have two shots in them and it will simply show you here's a two shot here's
[00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:46.760]   a three shot here's a master here's a single the biggest demonstration of it was when they were
[00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:52.840]   showing off that movie trailer idea where there's a template for you know in a world where love is
[00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:57.080]   against the law and it starts off with the dramatic single sun moving across it actually
[00:30:57.080 --> 00:31:01.000]   can it has a template where it knows it wants to start off with a wide with a wide shot it wants
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:07.320]   to start move to groups wants to move to like their third dramatic hero and has that ability to at least
[00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:12.600]   find segregate your clips between what kind of people are in there and what kind of shots there are
[00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:17.160]   for me that would be a huge that would really make me want to make a lot more a lot more movies
[00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:23.160]   for me it's it's such a i'm such a terrible uh in camera editor i'm shooting lots and lots of
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:27.560]   different stuff so i wind up with an hour's worth of footage of which i want to find three
[00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:31.720]   the ability to simply say i've been on this wide shot for a while i want to find a close up of
[00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:35.480]   somebody talking and just simply say i'm moving show me a close up of talking and then it will
[00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:41.480]   just simply narrow it down to what i want um you think it's interesting that cnn i report is one
[00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:46.120]   of the upload no i i actually think that that's that's actually really interesting because i think
[00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:50.440]   that uh you know cnn of course is spending more and more energy a lot of news gathering
[00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:56.440]   organizations are um focusing more on that and i think that it is uh it's a pretty profound thing
[00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:59.800]   when you think about how many people can get it and to be able to edit really quickly on your
[00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:05.960]   mac and boom show uh a thunderstorm or something or a car on fire or a house on fire or whatever
[00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:08.760]   they're going to show on the news and be able to do that i think a lot of people are talking
[00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:15.000]   to you or these interviews with steve jobs on face time right well and the thing is is the fact that
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:20.840]   that that someone uh can it stops people when it's happening really quickly from uploading the news
[00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:25.480]   because someone else is going to beat them to it you're going to see a lot of iphone or or reports
[00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:31.320]   coming from these things because it's so easy to do uh and i think that that's uh you know it's
[00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:37.160]   really really interesting when we look at the future of the press let's move on to uh garage
[00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:42.600]   band um there's some new features in garage band tighten the timing of your recorders with flex
[00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:49.320]   time your recordings with flex time um matt and then similar match the rhythm of all tracks with
[00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:53.640]   a single track using groove matching uh these are kind of the automation features that
[00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:59.480]   make your major producers in the record industry have been using for years to correct
[00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:03.880]   poor play now you could do it too one of the things that i'm really interested in doing is trying to
[00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:09.080]   mix uh disparate uh types of music together because you have a lot of things that work at different
[00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:14.440]   times or work at different uh you know in different structures and seeing how like if you want to do
[00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:21.240]   a drum and bass version of some you know uh more um uh you know uh historical music or whatever you
[00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:24.920]   know you could you could theoretically tie all that stuff back together um you know depending on
[00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:31.400]   how robust the the tool is uh recreate the sound of legendary guitar rigs and pedals using new
[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:35.640]   guitar amps and effects that kind of builds a little bit of propeller reason into uh into it
[00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:40.200]   and this is i think the most interesting thing uh you know the lessons that they announced in
[00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:45.560]   i like the last version of uh garage band didn't seem to ever really take off you know the celebrity
[00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:50.440]   uh guitar and piano lessons they had some they were great there was a store but i never saw a lot
[00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:55.400]   more in flux into the store well now they have lessons but not with celebrities but actually
[00:33:55.400 --> 00:34:01.800]   real lessons on how to play the guitar or the piano and something called how did i play which
[00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:07.000]   measures your your performance yeah i'm still i'm still kind of curious as to how well that's
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:13.240]   going to work out because uh it shows it's a great demo it shows you how uh it will it will give you
[00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:16.840]   the while while you're playing along on a usb keyboard for instance in the keyboard lessons
[00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:20.040]   it will give you the virtual keyboard up on the screen we'll show you where your fingers should be
[00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:25.160]   uh yeah it will give you like it'll let you play along with a chamber quartet minus the
[00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:29.160]   keyboard part and we'll show you exactly where you flub what you're doing better what your progress
[00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:34.200]   is and that's nice but it still doesn't really show it doesn't it doesn't teach you how to
[00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:38.440]   understand the music it simply helps you train to put your fingers in the right places at the right
[00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:42.200]   times and that's why all these instructional things have always sort of failed just for me
[00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:46.840]   personally because i mean i gave up on piano lessons after three or four years because my friends
[00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:50.760]   for some reason they were able to they were able to learn to read music but for me
[00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:55.400]   the sheet music was always just now i put this finger here here here and then this one here and
[00:34:55.400 --> 00:35:00.280]   then press it down meanwhile move this hand over there uh i wish that the lessons were a little bit
[00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:05.080]   more abstract by nature but here's how you should understand how this piece is put together here's
[00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:08.120]   what your right hand should be doing and here's what you should be here's how you should be training
[00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:12.840]   your mind on how your fingers should be moving across the keyboard so i i guess i guess
[00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:19.720]   a guitar hero i guess also um uh it remains to be seen how much support apple's gonna throw into
[00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:23.400]   this i mean they they announced these lessons in the last version and didn't really support them
[00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:28.600]   right yeah i i am very excited about the the concept of this interactive lesson where you can
[00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:32.200]   actually kind of play along and see how you're doing and seeing how you're following along i
[00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:37.560]   think that combined with more theory somewhere else i mean this is training your fingers i mean i
[00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:41.320]   always think of everything in thirds you know you you train people's fingers for a third of the
[00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:44.760]   time you train their mind a third of the time and then you let them play a third of the time
[00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:48.920]   and and that's really you know this is one component of three components that are important
[00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:54.040]   all right we're going to move to FaceTime you can download it right now it's available it's
[00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:59.800]   the desktop version of FaceTime uh and uh i've downloaded it and it looks like it requires snow
[00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:05.640]   leopard i'm not able to run it on my leopard only machine i've got i've got mine up and going
[00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:12.120]   uh it does it require it requires some verification uh so it took me like everyone's obviously
[00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:16.520]   downloading and trying to use it the same time uh but as soon as i was able to verify an email
[00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:21.800]   might get on back onto the site and verify my email address uh you have my preview window here on
[00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:26.600]   the left side of the window on the right side you have a scrolling list of every single email
[00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:30.760]   every single person in your uh inner contact database including ones that don't even have an
[00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:37.000]   email address associated with it uh the cool thing is that you can associate uh your face your mac
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:42.360]   FaceTime with an email address that's not necessarily uh your apple id email address so you can have
[00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:49.080]   it's for me i use my dot mac address just for my apple id and that's it and i've have it hooked up
[00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:53.880]   to my actual main email so hopefully it'll be one less thing to track uh so somebody can call you
[00:36:53.880 --> 00:37:00.280]   via your email address or your dot me it uses it uses the email address that you that you designate
[00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:05.640]   when you configure FaceTime for the first time on the mac is the one that will be used to find you
[00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:11.720]   i have not seen i keep scrolling through this list because i'm expecting that as friends of mine
[00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:16.120]   complete their downloads of FaceTime they get registered yeah i what i'm guessing is that the
[00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:20.360]   scrolling list i will see like an icon next to these names saying oh this person is on FaceTime and
[00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:25.480]   is has the application launched but didn't you think that it's sort of interesting though that
[00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:29.720]   everyone was expecting and of course it's integrated right into iChat well no it's a separate
[00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:34.360]   application that does nothing but FaceTime so that's kind of interesting development isn't it and if
[00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:39.800]   you had just tuned in you saw Becky Worley asked kind of the sixty four thousand dollar question when
[00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:44.520]   FaceTime was introduced on the iPhone 4 jobs pointed out that it used a stack of open source
[00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:50.600]   technologies force and sip and connection and so forth and and imply that because it's open source
[00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:55.640]   we will uh allow others to integrate with FaceTime and would it be nice Skype said what we'd love to
[00:37:55.640 --> 00:38:01.720]   be able to make Skype calls to a FaceTime receiver and vice versa um no announcement of that no
[00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:06.760]   indication of that although Becky Worley as you saw earlier in the show did knab Steve Jobs
[00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:11.720]   at the demo and ask him and he said we didn't say that he didn't say we he didn't say we are
[00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:17.480]   going to do it he said we just didn't say we wouldn't yeah what he said was we don't want to deal with
[00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:21.320]   the press fallout of talking about this right now this isn't what we're focused on that's what he
[00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:25.960]   said did you say that exactly or I think he just said we did yeah that's is that what he said
[00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:29.880]   well that was implied that was that was your interpretation of what he said that was my
[00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:33.320]   interpretation of what he said was we don't want to deal with that was a non denial denial
[00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:40.840]   or it was actually a what's the opposite of a denial I believe the technical journalists
[00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:45.640]   of term is I can't hear you I can hear you it was it was a non assertion assertion
[00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:52.360]   yeah although it does it he was very clear to use the what did he say 19 million devices that
[00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:57.320]   support FaceTime so okay when he introduced FaceTime over the summer it was we predict that there
[00:38:57.320 --> 00:39:01.560]   will be more than 10 million FaceTime devices right available by the end of the year okay good
[00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:06.600]   hey 14 million we're 14 million we're sold in the last three months 14 million iPhones 4s so
[00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:13.080]   absolutely uh people can use FaceTime but I think add it you know it's only on Wi-Fi with iPhone 4s
[00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:18.440]   and iPod touches new iPod touches so I think adding a desktop components important to
[00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:23.480]   making you know you got to be able to use it or it's not gonna people aren't gonna adopt it yeah
[00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:27.480]   and that that sort of points the reason why I think FaceTime is a separate app so they can release
[00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:33.080]   it like iTunes and they can do a Windows version of that app not an open not an open API that
[00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:37.960]   anybody can support but they can support Windows users by creating their own Windows version of
[00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:43.720]   that app under the Apple logo very very good point did they release did they announce a Windows version
[00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:49.960]   nope not a peep because you're absolutely right that's the argument for not building into iChat
[00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:57.000]   there's no iChat for Windows yeah very very good point anything else to say about FaceTime before
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:01.640]   we move along I think it's gonna be exciting for shows like this I mean when you saw what just
[00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:07.400]   happened at the at the event um finally being able to do that is gonna be I mean it's just
[00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:11.720]   yeah well I know would have been nice if I had the desktop version I we would have seen a nice
[00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:16.040]   full screen or not full well that's another question by the way when you use the desktop
[00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:21.960]   application it's the aspect ratio of an iPhone 4 and when you rotate the iPhone 4 to a landscape
[00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:27.000]   mode it does go to landscape mode does it have full screen Andy I'm looking at it right now it
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:32.360]   doesn't appear to have any sort of a manual rotation mode but looking for a button like that I've
[00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:37.080]   also been looking for like a multi-touch G if I do this on the trackpad does that rotate the screen
[00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:43.000]   when you go into full screen when you tap the the window button for full screen that's
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   what happens is that it enlarges right and so that's basically what you're looking at
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:52.760]   in a FaceTime window so maybe when there's an active call there'll be an option for rotating
[00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:58.120]   the screen manually but when it's in standby mode like this uh in terms of other features there
[00:40:58.120 --> 00:41:02.760]   doesn't appear to be uh yeah I'm sorry that should I'm I'm looking at the I'm looking for the menus
[00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:08.120]   right now under the video menu there's actually a dimmed out used landscape uh option well
[00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:11.960]   yeah I'm guessing and also a dimmed out enter full screen mode so I'm guessing those would
[00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:15.800]   become active oh okay once when you have an active call as soon as somebody calls you let me know
[00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:22.040]   of course and we'll we'll try out I'll I can I can put it this way if you have the desktop
[00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:27.560]   version of FaceTime and you know my real email address by all means call well I'm not gonna
[00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:31.000]   go I'm not gonna give it on the oh you got it I could do it for my you get to do that I have an
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:37.320]   iPhone 4 let me try it right here actually that's that's gonna be interesting because let's see if
[00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:43.720]   it goes to my iPhone or to the desktop version of FaceTime here oh that's interesting I wonder if
[00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:49.320]   I have to register you in some way and you want me to use the address that I normally send you
[00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:57.000]   email via exactly that's super magic unknown unguessable address how do I start a FaceTime call
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:03.320]   with a phone with a address I just how do I do that do you know
[00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:14.280]   uh um uh uh on the phone I mean I going going from memory uh well I'll just call you I guess
[00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:18.120]   but it probably will ring your
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:29.800]   you're I don't understand the FaceTime button uh here we go somebody's calling you so I don't have
[00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:30.040]   to
[00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:39.720]   well I get it's not it's not you no it's not me hello hey congratulations you want you you
[00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:46.200]   win the Chrysler Cordova you are you are FaceTiming you are now on back soon hey K-SIP all right now
[00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:51.480]   so Annie let's see if can you go full screen on that it does auto sense when when Ken rotates it
[00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:57.720]   it will auto sense the rotation on the phone okay I see yep I see a full well yep I see a full
[00:42:57.720 --> 00:43:00.920]   screen button at the bottom here Ken is waving I'm gonna put into full screen mode
[00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:07.720]   because that's a competitive advantage the frame is stuck with Ken's finger in a very
[00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:13.880]   inappropriate place so I'm not going to show it to you until it does go to full screen and then
[00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:24.680]   hopefully unlocks uh why are you locked up because oh I am hang on oh here we go okay yep so now we have
[00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:30.360]   it does go full screen yeah that's awesome that's nice now what happens Ken if you
[00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:35.080]   rotate it to a portrait mode again does it's like we're talking to Raj's parents on the big
[00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:42.840]   bang theory yeah you know uh rotate it sideways Ken to a portrait mode he's not
[00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:47.000]   you can't hear a thing yeah you you rotated sideways to portrait mode
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:55.720]   once again yeah we're not CNN just so you know he's I'm sorry you're on you're on you're on the
[00:43:55.720 --> 00:44:00.680]   desktop aren't you oh he's on the desktop okay yes we can't rotate he's just he's using the
[00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:06.600]   desktop got it so full screen landscape works rotation if you rotate it if you call from a phone
[00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:12.680]   and rotate got it so it does have you know it's comparable to Skype it doesn't have well things
[00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:17.400]   like Skype out doesn't have a lot of the features of Skype it's just it's basically
[00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:23.800]   FaceTime to FaceTime right and I don't see a control for choosing a video input but there is a
[00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:29.320]   control for choosing a microphone input all right so obviously they're not trying but maybe Skype
[00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:32.360]   is one of the companies that think about buying because they didn't put that kind of features
[00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:35.880]   into the desktop version of FaceTime here you're watching Mac Break Weekly any and I
[00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:41.320]   goes here Ken Shebertson via FaceTime Alex Lindsey from an undisclosed location there's Ken
[00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:48.680]   there's Ken say hello to the nice folks Kenny look at us folks Kenny you promised you'd

[00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:05.720]   changes to OS 10 in Lion in just a second and I think these might be a little bit controversial
[00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:09.880]   but we'll talk about in a moment before we do I want to mention our friends at squarespace.com

[00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:07.640]   Akko Alex Lindsey talking about the back to the Mac event what are you doing there what's going on
[00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:11.880]   hey you're Facebooking each other right there that's cool Andy I don't hear you though
[00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:19.640]   maybe I should have Facebooked you. FaceTime.com. Can I say FaceTime do you. There you go yeah see
[00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:23.640]   we're doing we're doing our own competing show live while we're doing this show with you. He's the
[00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:31.080]   britain to steal average advertisers back channel. Yes I love it but yeah Alex is going in from his
[00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:37.400]   from his iPhone and so if he rotates Alex I demonstrate this that's kind of cool they show this on
[00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:43.400]   stage two with Shiller and Steve right that's nice I'm sorry I wish I had like another hand
[00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:46.840]   free so I could be turning off lights to get rid of that glare. What happens if you go full
[00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:51.880]   screen with that image can you go full screen with a phone image you get wind I believe you get
[00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:58.120]   window box hang on we go full screen and it just turns into sort of window box display.
[00:47:58.120 --> 00:48:03.080]   And that's it see I don't know if you can like see like that.
[00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:09.720]   So now you can FaceTime Mac to Mac Mac to phone Mac to iPod and vice versa anything with FaceTime
[00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:15.000]   on it you do need Snow Leopard for this it's free and it's available now and when Alex and I went to
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:21.960]   the FaceTime link if you go to by the way apple.com/mac/FaceTime the link that we were getting was not
[00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:27.960]   to FaceTime but to iWork and iWork trial they may have fixed that by now hope they have a little error
[00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:34.280]   there or maybe just Apple still bears a grudge Leo. Yeah they know my IP address their heart has
[00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:37.880]   been broken by you. They know where to find me it was all over Twitter that they're like hey
[00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:45.800]   why am I getting iWork so the button's gone now oh there is yes okay uh and it is
[00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:52.680]   FaceTime.dmg that's good news so it is FaceTime now they fixed the uh they fixed the download.
[00:48:53.560 --> 00:49:02.200]   Um I think we're done I think we can talk about I think that's FaceTime that's iLife
[00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:06.520]   anything else we want to say about those before we move to uh Tyler Lyon Liger.
[00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:08.360]   No iWork hopefully we'll see that sometime.
[00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:14.600]   Oh iWork yeah what happened nothing to do yet nothing to do yet you know actually this does
[00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:20.680]   tie in with the lion because he showed a download of pages in the app store and it's my suspicion
[00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:26.760]   that from now on you're not going to buy packages or download directly you're going to have to buy
[00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:30.280]   it in the app store aren't you? I bet you all the Apple app so be that way.
[00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:37.720]   Exactly so let's talk about Lyon what uh uh what did Steve say Lyon uh OS 10 did he say it's OS 11
[00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:44.440]   or OS 10.8 i guess it's 10.8. I believe he's i believe he's stuck with OS 10 i don't believe
[00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:49.320]   if he if he mentioned an actual number i didn't mention it but he was talking about OS 10 all
[00:49:49.320 --> 00:50:00.200]   throughout okay um the uh first thing he said was it is back to the Mac in the sense that
[00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:10.440]   started with the Mac we rewrote Mac OS to run on the iPhone that's iOS then to the iPad and he
[00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:15.560]   showed almost like a recycling right exactly that's that new terminology we started with Mac OS 10
[00:50:15.560 --> 00:50:19.800]   created a new a new version called iOS which were used for the iPhone we added new things and
[00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:24.200]   perfected it and now it's on the iPhone what we'd like to do is we're inspired by these innovations
[00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:29.320]   and now we'd like to bring them back to the Mac. So what does that mean what are we seeing what
[00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:33.960]   what what a iOS are we seeing on the Mac uh mostly it's uh it's it's a couple things as
[00:50:33.960 --> 00:50:37.320]   matter of fact the most interesting thing is uh one of the most interesting things is actually
[00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:42.600]   how we started off for the first five minutes to explain why multi-touch was coming to
[00:50:43.480 --> 00:50:49.000]   to the Mac OS in the way that it was coming he called it not multi-touch but multi-touch gestures
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:55.000]   right because he was making he made a big point about how he doesn't believe that it works at all
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:59.800]   to have multi-touch on a vertical surface it was sort of like it was almost like the antenna gate
[00:50:59.800 --> 00:51:05.080]   demo where he was showing here is why we're not idiots with that it has it has occurred to us
[00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:10.040]   you could do a multi-touch display on a notebook but here's why we've rejected that idea basically
[00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:14.120]   because your arm gets heavy he says on a vertical surface you could do in this and it's not
[00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:20.040]   ergonomic yeah exactly touch surfaces don't want to be vertical it gives great demo but after an
[00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:25.240]   extended period of time your arm wants to fall off touch surfaces want to be horizontal hence
[00:51:25.240 --> 00:51:31.240]   iPads so that's so he went he went on to talk about how the way that apple has decided to do
[00:51:31.240 --> 00:51:36.040]   multi-touch on the desktop is to simply have really good desktop multi-touch controllers like the
[00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:41.160]   multi-touch trackpad like the like the magic trackpad and like the new magic mouse with multi-touch built
[00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:46.040]   in so and there was and there really was a author during this demo looks like there's a brand new
[00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:52.120]   verb that they're using called flick that the people the the apple engineers and managers who
[00:51:52.120 --> 00:51:56.280]   were talking about this it's they didn't announce it as terminology but you can tell that they've
[00:51:56.280 --> 00:52:00.520]   been using this word flick where you think like a month's and months you just you simply flick over
[00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:04.440]   to this side and now here is your here's your preview then you flick back and now here once again
[00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:07.800]   is your dashboard view so i think that that's something that we're going to be
[00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:11.800]   learning a lot more about this isn't really anything new though because if you have a magic
[00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:17.480]   trackpad or a magic mouse you can do gestures in os 10 right now yeah yeah but there's a
[00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:22.920]   they're a little bit more relevant now that they have this new launchpad area where it's expected
[00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:28.440]   that you're gonna there's i'm sorry two different twists one is that it seems as though full screen
[00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:34.280]   mode is going to be one of the core features of modern apps on ios to the extent that there's
[00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:40.360]   even going to be the implication is that there's going to be actual uh api like xcode support
[00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:44.520]   for full screen modes that apps so i've built just like a built-in feature of all
[00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:48.680]   unexpected built-in feature of mac apps is that they have windows and they have menus they have
[00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:54.120]   icons now it seems as though part of the standard mac OS bag of tricks is that uh if it's appropriate
[00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:58.200]   each one of these apps is going to have a full screen mode which works not only just for the
[00:52:58.200 --> 00:53:03.240]   idea of having a nice uni taski sort of full screen no distraction interface but also because
[00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:07.960]   it works really great in this launchpad area where if you if you go from like this little
[00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:11.800]   this environment that has all your windows in it and all your application icons on it and you
[00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:17.000]   flick to the left to go back to pages for instance you don't know if you left pages in a certain
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:22.520]   mode you won't see windows and menus and things you will see just a screen filling document of what
[00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:27.320]   you were working on and that's where you landed at the minute you flick to the left from your finder
[00:53:27.320 --> 00:53:31.560]   view so that's it looks like it's going to be a very subtle point that's going to reach into
[00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:37.080]   so many different places of the mac experience what's pretty clear is that apple has decided to
[00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:46.440]   completely rethink ui um so this full screen the menu bar's gone it really is the it is the ipad
[00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:52.440]   interface or the many bar well keep in mind that we're not talking about removing it from ios we're
[00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:57.000]   talking about how applications when appropriate when it's appropriate for them to have a full-screen
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:04.280]   interface there is sort of a a blessed version of having an ios one window interface where you
[00:54:04.280 --> 00:54:10.280]   don't necessarily have menus where it is really down to one task at a time as opposed to the full
[00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:15.320]   palette of what you can do with the word processor with a graphics editor or photo organizer and
[00:54:15.320 --> 00:54:19.240]   you can i mean by the way i should i should point out i'm doing it right now with chrome i mean that's
[00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:24.120]   full-screen chrome there's no menu bar it's just uh it's just the web and as i myself said a couple
[00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:29.880]   weeks ago when i was talking about how i've tried to what i started to use my ipad more as a general
[00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:34.600]   writing device only because it is such a great no distractions tool to have one window that just
[00:54:34.600 --> 00:54:40.280]   focuses you on what you're doing that really could be a very salable feature uh even the mac apps are
[00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:45.960]   starting to have problems where uh less clever programmers when they need to add a new feature
[00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:50.200]   their solution is well we'll just add a new tool palette or we'll add a new menu bar or even worse
[00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:55.240]   we'll add a new form of stack menu bar so we'll have more places to put more controls this seems
[00:54:55.240 --> 00:55:01.160]   to be a more emphatic gesture from apple to say try to think about ways of delivering the power of
[00:55:01.160 --> 00:55:05.880]   your apps in a way where you have minimal interface and just focus on the task at hand
[00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:11.480]   very interesting yeah i think that i think that the uh number one i definitely think this is a
[00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:15.400]   progression i think what we're seeing here is is we are and we've talked about this for the last
[00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:21.400]   six months is that we are on a on a path uh to o s you know ios being the next o s i mean i think
[00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:26.600]   this is and if we were looking for any sim you know uh any indicators i think that's 100 percent
[00:55:26.600 --> 00:55:32.040]   this is the direction we're going i think that the uh you know i do think when we look at the the
[00:55:32.040 --> 00:55:36.920]   full screen in in that process um you know i i still want to touch my screen i know that they
[00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:41.000]   they say that they don't you know i i constantly reach over and touch my screen i'm constantly like
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:45.080]   oh oh i can't do that it's because well now i i will say that i was surprised that i didn't say the apple
[00:55:45.080 --> 00:55:50.440]   tv would support you know the facetime in some way shape or form as we started look at this because
[00:55:50.440 --> 00:55:54.840]   i know that you know now i'm much i'm very happy that i still have a mac mini because i could put a
[00:55:54.840 --> 00:56:01.400]   little webcam over with me but that's something that i almost dare not to speculate about
[00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:07.320]   think of another if if apples idea is that many many apps should have a full screen minimal
[00:56:07.320 --> 00:56:13.240]   interface mode doesn't make that really easy to port those things onto ios and port those things
[00:56:13.240 --> 00:56:18.520]   so that they're relevant to the apple tv as well as to the desktop i don't i'm not sure if i agree
[00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:22.600]   with the idea that ios is going to be the main operating system because it just wasn't built for
[00:56:22.600 --> 00:56:28.360]   that and it's just not appropriate i do think that the idea of having uh if you imagine a venn diagram
[00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:33.320]   where you have circle one moving mac os and circle two being ios lion will sort of make sure
[00:56:33.320 --> 00:56:37.640]   these two have an interlapping zone in between so that if you spend a lot of your time on your iphone
[00:56:37.640 --> 00:56:41.640]   or a lot of your time on the ipad you're going to find a lot of experiences on your mac that will
[00:56:41.640 --> 00:56:45.400]   be very very consistent with what you were doing when you were just on your commuter rail just
[00:56:45.400 --> 00:56:49.960]   editing a document on your way back home there are also ash adding something called mission control
[00:56:49.960 --> 00:56:59.400]   which combines elements of spaces expose a dashboard and uh the app store i guess into one
[00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:06.360]   what was the fourth element of mission control uh spaces expose the dock and that's a dock
[00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:11.080]   and dashboard in the dock yeah it seems to be like a three-tiered display where the top strip is going
[00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:16.520]   to be all of the bottom strip is just the dock the middle strip is going to be like expose
[00:57:16.520 --> 00:57:22.520]   in which you have sort of minimized versions of your windows and your active apps at the top strip
[00:57:22.520 --> 00:57:28.840]   are going to be the full screen versions excuse me full screen experiences that you have open at a
[00:57:28.840 --> 00:57:34.280]   certain given moment so for instance if you are reading a book or reading a manual in preview and
[00:57:34.280 --> 00:57:39.160]   you have it in full in full screen mode then you just simply have an open book among those tops
[00:57:39.160 --> 00:57:43.560]   those top strips of minimized views and so you click on that and you immediately go all the way
[00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:51.080]   back the integration with x uh with spaces is just the switching mechanism the idea that you have
[00:57:51.080 --> 00:57:56.040]   sort of a slideshow screen that's the flick right exactly where you're from one place to another
[00:57:56.040 --> 00:58:00.200]   right so instead of worrying about how how will this window come in and superimpose itself
[00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:04.920]   we'll know your the camera is just moving to this entirely different view that just has features
[00:58:04.920 --> 00:58:11.160]   on that they did add one cool new trick to expose however where instead of having just separated
[00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:15.960]   individual windows that uh of every single open window and having the option of using a different
[00:58:15.960 --> 00:58:20.840]   key command to just see the windows that are associated with one app now the windows associated
[00:58:20.840 --> 00:58:25.000]   with a certain app are now in a stack uh where they're there's staggered slightly so you can see
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:28.840]   what's underneath them and they're still live views but all of your safari windows are still
[00:58:28.840 --> 00:58:33.960]   going to be in one pile instead of sort of scattered somewhere in the grid very pretty it really does
[00:58:33.960 --> 00:58:38.120]   feel like a rethinking of the o s and of course it's an interim step where you have
[00:58:38.120 --> 00:58:44.440]   both but do you think we're going to move away from the finder based o s or is that always going
[00:58:44.440 --> 00:58:48.680]   to be with us i think i think they're starting they're starting to minimize the reason for having
[00:58:48.680 --> 00:58:53.960]   the finder in the first place it seems as though now you could spend all of your time in uh
[00:58:53.960 --> 00:58:59.400]   mission control and only go into the finder when you need to do basic file maintenance so i don't
[00:58:59.400 --> 00:59:04.680]   think i don't think that they're going to be deleting the finder from uh from lion however i think
[00:59:04.680 --> 00:59:09.800]   that the goal is to make sure that it's no longer the concierge to your entire mac experience they're
[00:59:09.800 --> 00:59:15.000]   hoping that when you turn on your mac or or wake it from sleep they will want you to be to want to
[00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:19.080]   wake it into mission control instead of waking in into the finder and i think that i think that
[00:59:19.080 --> 00:59:22.760]   you're going to end up with a situation where the apple is sneaking you know sneaking up on us as the
[00:59:22.760 --> 00:59:25.640]   use group which is that we're gonna they're going to get to a point where we don't really use the
[00:59:25.640 --> 00:59:29.720]   finder and we don't really buy applications in any anywhere other than the app store and we
[00:59:29.720 --> 00:59:33.080]   don't really do any of that stuff and it's only 10 percent of us that still are doing that and then
[00:59:33.080 --> 00:59:37.960]   they'll just kind of it'll just suddenly drop off on on some OS update i mean i think that that's
[00:59:37.960 --> 00:59:42.360]   i don't think i'm gonna try that. That's my big question mark is does apple say well we'll leave
[00:59:42.360 --> 00:59:48.520]   it in for the 10 percent of you the use terminal and finder or do we get rid of it in three years
[00:59:48.520 --> 00:59:56.200]   will we have no terminal commands no no no finder no no file system well no that's i'm thinking
[00:59:56.200 --> 01:00:01.000]   back to a comment that an apple engineer said to me before 10.0 was officially released and they
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:06.760]   announced that the underlying structure of the mac OS 10 was going to be Unix they said they
[01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:12.120]   it was a really good comment he said to me that if you go looking for Unix in mac OS 10 and you do
[01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:17.080]   not find it we feel as though we will have failed if you don't go looking for it and you find it we
[01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:21.240]   also will feel as though we have failed and that's exactly what they accomplished i think that that's
[01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:25.000]   the sort of thing we're going to be seeing here where if you go looking for a specific experience
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:30.280]   and you do not find it they'll think that they've kind of screwed up however if you wanted to you
[01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:34.200]   if you want to use the application launch or the application environment the switcher that you like
[01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:39.400]   and you're fine you're you see we find yourself forced to use a technology an application that's
[01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:44.520]   been part of mac OS since 1984 even though you don't really want it don't really need it i think
[01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:48.440]   that they will feel as though they really didn't prosecute these iOS ideas the way that they feel
[01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:52.760]   as though they could have and the thing that scares me i i think is that is that i think that
[01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:58.600]   the way uh you know apple's going to look at this is is for the for 90 percent of the consumers well
[01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:04.120]   it's a 80 percent 80 percent of the consumers out there uh the iOS on their mac would be plenty
[01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:10.520]   for 80 to 90 percent of the developers the iOS the app store would be great especially if you're
[01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:14.040]   a little developer trying to build up your own e-commerce and manage it and support it and do
[01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:18.920]   all those other things uh and just being in a big marketplace like that and being easy to buy i
[01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:22.040]   think what they're also going to look at is that 80 if 80 percent of the market ends up buying
[01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:25.240]   stuff from the app store you have no choice but to put it on the app store because no one's going
[01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:30.520]   to know you exist and so i think that the thing is is that i think apple's i think apple's going to
[01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:35.400]   continue to play down that that road and the result is going to be you know at some point in
[01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:40.520]   time it just doesn't make sense for the consumer or the or the developer to be anywhere other than
[01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:45.640]   in this little closed environment for a developer you know piracy becomes less of an issue people
[01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:50.600]   casually copying it to their friends becomes less of an issue but also for the user losing
[01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:54.920]   your app uh forgetting your seal numbers forgetting your you know trying to figure out how you know
[01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:58.840]   losing your computer not being able to reinstall all your applications you know these are all things
[01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:03.880]   that go away the way that we went away for our iphone you know i you know i i i killed an iphone
[01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:10.280]   and what what did i do i just plugged in and you know restored it you know back to exactly where it
[01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:14.280]   was the moment i you know the last time i i backed it up and i think that that is something that is
[01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:18.600]   that's a drug that a lot of people are really going to enjoy yeah it's it was it was certainly an
[01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:24.360]   incomplete demo i i was expecting more of a power walkthrough of what line was going to be as opposed
[01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:29.720]   to just a full a philosophical brief on where they're going with it i did think though it was
[01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:35.160]   interesting that they didn't mention how uh the new app store for uh desktop apps is going to
[01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:40.280]   integrate with software update it'd be great if i just if if software update will simply be
[01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:44.600]   this new app store interface where it will be the way that they deliver security updates the way that
[01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:49.160]   they deliver i work obviously i work updates and i like updates but if that's going to be the one
[01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:53.240]   place i go every time i want to see what's been updated since the last time that i checked
[01:02:53.240 --> 01:03:04.680]   um the app store is the biggest change is a lot of a lot of let's let's hold on all that thought
[01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:07.800]   we're going to talk about the app store i want to take a little break we do have to kind of move
[01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:13.800]   this along because uh twig is coming up in about nine minutes uh so uh we're going to cover the
[01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:19.240]   app store we'll skip the the picks this week um and and we'll cover and we'll finish up with the
[01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:23.320]   final words on the macbook here so we have a few more minutes but we don't have a whole lot of time so
[01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:28.840]   let me mention uh gazelle this is actually a good time to mention gazelle because if you are
[01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:35.080]   sitting on any uh any existing apple hardware that you might want to get rid of your loser who just
[01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:40.200]   bought an error a month ago loser yeah i don't know what kind that might be but if you go to gazelle
[01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:46.840]   you don't have to sell it you get money for it by gazelling it g-a-z-e-l-l-e get cash for
[01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:53.240]   your gadgets of course a lot of people use this to upgrade to the iphone four let me just see if the
[01:03:53.240 --> 01:04:01.400]   macbook error is worth anything uh right now on the uh on the gazelle page which version uh i have
[01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:06.600]   i think this one let me just let me just see if i can is it power on yes it's in good because
[01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:12.200]   so here's what you do you fill out the form you say what you've got what condition it's in they say
[01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:16.440]   we'll pay you four and eighteen bucks for that macbook here yes thank you you can see the price
[01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:23.960]   plummeting in fact i would go for it now because it's only gonna go down so this is the beauty of
[01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:28.280]   gazelle you what you do is you get a box from gazelle they send you a box with the mailing label and
[01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:33.960]   you can just pile in all your stuff you get your price ahead of time you send it off to gazelle they
[01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:38.680]   send you a check as long as it matches what you said the condition wasn't so forth they do wipe
[01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:42.360]   all your data you don't have to think about that their experts are really good and careful about
[01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:50.920]   that gazelle is the way to afford new gadgets don't sell it gazelle it and if what you've got is utter
[01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:57.720]   crap it's sold they can't sell it they'll recycle it for you and they'll recycle it green recycling
[01:04:57.720 --> 01:05:05.160]   uh they don't guarantee nothing goes in the landfill it's a EPA certified they recycle all of the
[01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:09.720]   parts all of the heavy metals they don't poison the environment it's a great way to recycle your
[01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:18.920]   stuff to proper recycling through excel what's the good so it's interesting they even mentioned
[01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:24.120]   the macbook here by using kazelle consumers are responsibly disposing of old electronics and
[01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:27.880]   replacing them though with the newer more environmentally friendly items like the gorgeous macbook air
[01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:33.800]   that's interesting that's right in there hey by the way gazelle if you have a charity gazelle has a
[01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:39.720]   page for a cause you can tune your gadgets into cash for your cause by setting up a gazelle page
[01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:45.160]   for your your charity your your school your team and they will take all the money you raise and
[01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:50.840]   send it right to you so your parents or friends whatever send their gadgets to gazelle the money
[01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:55.320]   goes to you and gazelle does a great job of this too i want you to check it out don't just sell
[01:05:55.320 --> 01:06:01.400]   it gazelle it if you use gazelle by the way use the offer code mac break actually it's mac break
[01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:06.600]   two all right mac break and the number two and you will get an additional bonus of five percent
[01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:09.800]   on the value of your items so entering your all your items put them in the box send them out
[01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:16.280]   and then use mac break two to add a bonus five percent payment for your used gadgets gazelle
[01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:24.280]   g-a-z-e-l-l-e don't sell it gazelle it and yanaco alix lindsey mac break weekly we're covering the
[01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:30.360]   announcements from apple uh the app store is based on the apple store i got to point out right away
[01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:35.960]   first thing that you i don't think you're going to see apps written for the ipad and iphone on the mac
[01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:41.000]   because they're different processors i think they could be emulated the mac has a lot of processing
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:47.560]   power i think so yeah but it didn't imply that of course but would apple really want to have a
[01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:53.800]   substandard ios run a substandard experience for ios apps on the desktop when they could just simply
[01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:58.600]   say come on but for god's sake it's only five hundred bucks by an ipad right so don't be fooled
[01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:05.560]   by the word ios in this case uh this app store is for mac and die shaps so the whole wrap was that
[01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:10.360]   the the theme was that we took a look at everything that makes the everything that we like from ios
[01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:15.080]   that we could easily put into macos one of them was just simply the way that it's great to have
[01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:19.640]   one centralized location where people can buy apps uh one centralized location for getting
[01:07:19.640 --> 01:07:24.200]   updates and uh the ability to get a one click install on just about everything and make that
[01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:27.640]   into a consistent user experience so they're they're by eight different things that they
[01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:31.640]   mentioned that they're taken from ios but that was it's not it's not emerging of these two
[01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:35.240]   operating systems it was just a stealing of a great idea only this time they're stealing from
[01:07:35.240 --> 01:07:41.640]   themselves so it's even better okay now i i have to say i my heart pounded a little bit when i saw
[01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:47.240]   this uh i can see and and i'll let you alex make this point that developers might like this but
[01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:53.400]   it looks to me like apple's looking at their iphone ipad ecosystem and saying boy this is great
[01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:59.240]   it's closed we get 30 percent of everything that's sold uh we can approve everything that's on day
[01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:04.440]   it's really easy for consumers developers you're gonna like it we can make more money and all we
[01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:09.400]   have to do is get all these independent guys out of the picture are we gonna see a day where we have
[01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:16.760]   to jailbreak a Macintosh to put our own software on it i i i actually wouldn't be that surprised if
[01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:21.800]   we get to a point where you have to jailbreak your your mac to do that i i um but i think that again
[01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:27.240]   for 96 to 99 percent of the developers that wouldn't really matter and they would find their stuff
[01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:32.120]   on the on the mac so i you know i don't think that you know again i think that we i apple is a
[01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:35.640]   ninety ninety company what will ninety percent of people do ninety percent of the time and i think
[01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:40.760]   that that's been very a very successful model for them and i think that the you know i i can say as
[01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:46.520]   a developer uh you know i'm gonna put a lot of work into your own e-commerce system or you're
[01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:52.120]   gonna be ready especially if they're gonna deal downloads updates um you know e-commerce all
[01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:56.600]   that ease of use all of the commenting systems everything else that's gonna be you know that's
[01:08:56.600 --> 01:09:01.880]   it's gonna run you 22 to 20 you know 25 percent from digital river or other people who will do a
[01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:06.120]   compro service and you will not be part of this ecosystem that has been very successful where
[01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:11.240]   people can casually find your stuff so i think that um for many many developers this is this is a
[01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:16.440]   big deal and i think that i think that probably for more than half of them it's a big deal especially
[01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:21.560]   small developers who don't have the resources of adobe or auto desk or something like that that
[01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:25.320]   can't promote their stuff on their own they can't build a great website they can't build all the
[01:09:25.320 --> 01:09:29.160]   other pieces that they want they don't have to i think that's why a lot of them like developing
[01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:33.880]   for the eye for the i-phone on the ipad is they can just put an app up and a lot and you know and
[01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:39.000]   the thing is is that it's not working for everybody but again i think that for well over 90 percent it
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:43.000]   will and i think that the trajectory of that whether we like it or not and i'm not saying that i'd
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:47.320]   necessarily like it across the board but whether we like it or not i can definitely see a trajectory
[01:09:47.320 --> 01:09:52.200]   five years down the road where this is the only game in town because it and apple doesn't need to
[01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:56.360]   do anything about it they don't even need to end the other option it's that oh if you're not developing
[01:09:56.360 --> 01:10:00.200]   inside of the app store you only have access to five or ten percent of the market that's still
[01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:05.720]   using manual downloads because they hate them you know the advantage for the developer is that that
[01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:08.600]   this is a closed system they're not going to have as much piracy they're going to have people
[01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:13.320]   paying for every app they have it may mean that they can drop the price a lot of the price that you
[01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:17.800]   pay for applications is taking into account the fact that ten the ten people are using your
[01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:21.720]   application for everyone that buys it so the thing is is that you know there's that there can be a
[01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:26.920]   temptation to drop that price for the user because i'm already authenticated it means i don't have to
[01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:31.720]   find all the stupid serial numbers and all those codes and all and i don't have to tie that all in
[01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:37.400]   that's all tied in at the o-s obviously there's a lot of disadvantages to it a loss of freedom
[01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:41.800]   a loss of you know all kinds of other pieces and you've heard Steve Jobs' response when people
[01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:46.840]   say we're losing choice he says you got choice you got Linux you got windows you don't need us
[01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:52.920]   and i think that's i think that's kind of i i i i do think that we are looking five years down
[01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:56.680]   the road of something that is a closed system i think this is something that that prints money
[01:10:56.680 --> 01:11:02.040]   for apple but i also think it it does it because it makes it easier for 90 percent of the consumers
[01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:07.000]   and 90 percent of the developers you agree Andy i think they do they're doing it because it's
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:11.240]   a way to differentiate themselves on an ongoing basis from windows and all the other operating
[01:11:11.240 --> 01:11:14.840]   systems they've already they've already stated that they're not they're making a little bit of
[01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:18.520]   money from the app store but not as much as you would think so i really think this is just a way
[01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:23.160]   to add a feature that will resonate with consumers i wouldn't go so far as to say that they love
[01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:27.560]   their consumers they will do everything they can to include it's more like we need to always
[01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:31.960]   continue to do what we can to make our operating system better than anything else out there and
[01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:36.520]   to remove that one bit of hassle of how do you get applications and how do you install them and
[01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:40.360]   how do you upgrade them what happens when you have a system crash and you lose all them this
[01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:45.160]   seems like a very neat tidy way to to cut through all that although i think the the the
[01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:49.000]   celebrity impression you should have done there leo was not colombo it should have been
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:52.840]   uh jimmy steward it's one for life like you're just looking at the one thing you still can't get
[01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:59.640]   your claws on your hair off you know i mean i think there's gonna be i think there's gonna be a lot
[01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:05.480]   of really hysterical and some odd point walking about this is a you see i was born to you about this
[01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:09.400]   tinfoil hat saw apple wants all of the market share wants to control everything that you're
[01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:12.840]   doing well it remains to be seen but i could absolutely see apple doing that
[01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:17.720]   i mean but the thing is is how many people how many like we're not a good example because we
[01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:22.120]   you know have all this custom stuff and we're geeks and we you know do all this stuff but but
[01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:28.360]   how many of our our our you know cousins and parents and friends just want to turn the computer on and
[01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:31.560]   have it work and when they buy something they just want it to be on if something goes wrong they just
[01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:35.960]   want to be re-able able to reinstall it and they just want to make that experience and people if you
[01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:40.600]   have if you have a religious or a political problem with the idea of apple having an app store
[01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:44.600]   so long as there's still the ability to never use the app store if you never want to use it
[01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:49.080]   then any complaint about the app store becomes null and void if it becomes a problem where
[01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:53.560]   you have to be tapped into the app store ecosystem as a developer to have any success
[01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:57.720]   writing apple and selling apple products then it becomes a problem for apple i don't think
[01:12:57.720 --> 01:13:01.560]   they're gonna let that happen but i think apple doesn't need to do anything i think the thing is
[01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:08.040]   is exactly the point that's going to be the next i always have if developer if i don't if i've given
[01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:13.400]   up 80 percent of my market by not developing for it on screw yeah the the big question that i
[01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:18.040]   have my briefing with apple a couple hours and the number on question is going to be is this thing
[01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:22.600]   going to be curated in any way or is it going to be like the wild wild west is going to be curated
[01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:28.040]   yeah but even ask oh well that that's not necessarily a given because they've already
[01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:32.680]   said the the fact that they're certainly not locking the OS to make sure that the app store is the only
[01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:38.280]   source of apps for for that software means well not yet that's that's one hell of a bit of speculation
[01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:43.400]   i think i i think that the idea that they're gonna be it means that they're doing away with the idea
[01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:48.440]   of here's the reason why we have to curate the iPhone app store because when you have a handset
[01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:52.360]   that connects to a network that everybody has to share we have to make sure that these things
[01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:56.040]   behave properly we want to make sure that everything's stable this is going to prove that that is
[01:13:56.040 --> 01:14:01.800]   utter BS that the real reason i know because it is because they want end-to-end control of the ecosystem
[01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:07.080]   and i i suspect you're going to assert that here i guess i can i'm different from this that's the
[01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:12.840]   point of what i'm here no i'm with you but and this will this will be the test of it and if they create
[01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:18.120]   an app store that is not curated this will be the test then i'll say wow apple that's impressive i
[01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:22.200]   don't know why they would do that because because remember on the iphone you do not have the opportunity
[01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:25.320]   that you don't have the alternative of buying things that are not sold
[01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:27.720]   through the app store unless you jailbreak your phone which is something that is right
[01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:32.600]   necessary by the way i think it is curated because didn't steve say there's store opens in 90 days
[01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:37.080]   you can start submitting your apps now well it doesn't mean that it doesn't mean you can just simply
[01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:40.600]   send an email with a link to where people can download stuff i mean there's going to have to be a
[01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:44.520]   process where you have your screenshots ready you have your descriptions ready you tell how much
[01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:48.920]   where you want it to go you want to be priced at what what day and date you wanted to to drop that
[01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:52.920]   that you really can't infer anything from there again i got you can ask the question i mean i
[01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:57.080]   we don't know obviously so i i'd love to hear apple's answer but i think that i think that apple is
[01:14:57.080 --> 01:15:03.000]   is definitely looking at the large school market the the concerned parent market the idea that if
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:07.640]   apple curates it you know this is the end of i mean their kids have a close you could possibly
[01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:11.240]   what if they get to a point where they don't get rid of the os you can always go back to it
[01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:16.520]   but you have the ability as an administrator to lock it to the ios solution which means you now
[01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:20.520]   are in this curated environment where you know if you're a school giving it to the kids or your
[01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:24.440]   your parents are giving it to your kids you could theoretically close that off if you if you chose
[01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:30.600]   to yeah it's curated for well we'll see of course it's curated it's obviously curated i mean this is
[01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:36.040]   this is apple asserting from the point of view of the public this is good for you updates are
[01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:42.440]   automatic security is assured uh you get a better price you get a very transparent process one
[01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:47.880]   click access this is what you've always wanted in applications from apple's point of view we control
[01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:52.040]   the ecosystem and by the way that's good for apple too because it makes the apple experience superior
[01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:55.880]   and from apple's point of view we control the ecosystem you can't tell me they don't make money
[01:15:55.880 --> 01:16:00.520]   if they sell eight billion apps and they make 30 percent where's the money going they're making
[01:16:00.520 --> 01:16:05.160]   money this is this is something they said to stockholders and if they if they exaggerated no
[01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:09.240]   you're right yeah that's so that's a big problem they'll lie to me but they won't lie to stockholders
[01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:14.840]   no you're you're absolutely right uh this is i suspect this is what Steve Jobs has always wanted
[01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:20.440]   as a walled garden um and he's you know he'll say you have choice but it's just if you want apple
[01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:24.760]   this is your choice and a lot of people are gonna still choose it i mean that that's the reality
[01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:30.680]   and more people will choose it i think you're absolutely right you schools uh people who don't
[01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:37.080]   care about open systems companies if i'm a if i'm a company i'm gonna want to have uh the ability to
[01:16:37.080 --> 01:16:40.840]   only provide that closed environment to all my employees and that's gonna be a buying that's
[01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:45.800]   gonna be a choice that i will make to make sure that that you know that that's all tied up i just
[01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:50.600]   i just found uh i just thought of what evil apple would do like the comic book version of evil apple
[01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:56.040]   where once they get the the app the ios excuse me the macos app store up off the ground in eight months
[01:16:56.040 --> 01:17:01.640]   they release under they they hire somebody to release the first mac trojan horse or virus and
[01:17:01.640 --> 01:17:06.280]   they say well you know what that wasn't available to the app store you know we test all of our stuff
[01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:10.840]   they don't need to do that they don't i'm talking i'm talking about the comic book evil apple but
[01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:15.000]   i'll tell you the comic book evil apple with steve jabs talking on monday completely
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:24.360]   misinterpreting what open means saying oh you know androids not open it's fragmented and uh and this
[01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:30.200]   is this is uh i believe this is his worldview and i don't believe he believes in open source or open
[01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:34.440]   software or the ability to install the programs of your choice but we'll see i mean that's just my
[01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:39.240]   belief about him open is so is so open to interpretation i was monitoring a panel at the
[01:17:39.240 --> 01:17:43.640]   echomicon and i was talking about the ipad as a really nice hybrid between open source components
[01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:48.120]   and proprietary components and that totally derailed the entire panel for 10 minutes of oh well it's
[01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:53.400]   not really open because it's not bsd and it's not free software foundation is that what i mean by
[01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:58.360]   open is that you ain't seen nothing yet i mean yes it's open now it's based on an open platform but
[01:17:58.360 --> 01:18:02.520]   i have a feeling we're gonna see it become more and more closed and you know it's not an
[01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:08.120]   unreasonable response to the security issues you're seeing on other side on the on the windows side
[01:18:08.120 --> 01:18:14.360]   on the other hand i think that is the same kind of red herring that child pornography is for people
[01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:20.120]   want to censor the internet it's a very convenient whipping boy but it's not really the reason why
[01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:24.600]   apple wants it closed i don't think kind of apple wants to completely control the user experience
[01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:28.440]   they got a taste of it on the iphone they got a taste of the ipad and now they're going
[01:18:28.440 --> 01:18:34.120]   nah let's do it on the desktop hairless cats for everybody yes yes yes yes
[01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:39.800]   anyway we'll see i mean i you know and i i pray that i'm wrong and uh and i hope that
[01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:43.640]   users who care will will assert themselves and tell apple that's not what they want
[01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:49.560]   um but you know steed it'll either work for users or it will not you work for users if it works for
[01:18:49.560 --> 01:18:53.640]   users then politics and religion should not be part of this discussion you might be right we'll see
[01:18:53.640 --> 01:18:58.040]   i think it's more see here's my deal i think it is more than politics and religion i think it's a
[01:18:58.040 --> 01:19:04.840]   fundamental part of the of the six for us in the long run the success of the ecosystem is that
[01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:10.600]   it's day open and it's fundamentally for a business point of view for apple it's absolutely good for
[01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:15.160]   apple that it not and that's not a user feature it can contribute to user features but open is
[01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:20.840]   not a user feature yeah well we'll see i think that i think that the thing is is that it's uh uh
[01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:26.120]   i think it for the most part on an average day uh it would be good for the consumer the developer
[01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:30.120]   everything else the problem is you know on a on a good day you know we always say when people
[01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:33.960]   ask why why do i spend all this money on cameras you know these big cameras with all the stuff on
[01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:38.520]   it i was like well a little camera can shoot just a perfect little image when the environment is
[01:19:38.520 --> 01:19:42.680]   perfect you know when the environment is a good situation it'll it's broadcast but i want the big
[01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:47.160]   camera because when i when things go wrong i want to be able to dial all that stuff in and that's the
[01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:52.200]   that's what you give up when you start giving up all the freedom is you can't dial stuff in you can't
[01:19:52.200 --> 01:19:57.000]   you know uh you can't fix it you can't customize it the way you want to i'm already frustrated
[01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:00.840]   with where the mac is now and its ability to customize it i mean i want i mean i want
[01:20:00.840 --> 01:20:05.160]   os 10 on alienware software i mean alienware hardware because i don't have enough slots i don't
[01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:10.520]   have enough stuff to customize and and i can what scares me is it is going the other direction i
[01:20:10.520 --> 01:20:14.280]   think this is now that you can now that we can see it more clearly this is where they always
[01:20:14.280 --> 01:20:19.400]   wanted to go more steve always wanted to go but we'll see and uh and i should point out that this
[01:20:19.400 --> 01:20:24.360]   is where microsoft would love to go to uh they've floated the idea of a windows app store and
[01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:28.760]   the thing is this whole process scares me but i kind of say as a developer i'm going to be
[01:20:28.760 --> 01:20:36.760]   submitting our software through that you know because you know because you like crack i like i
[01:20:36.760 --> 01:20:42.360]   like business i like commerce is great gets you really high just watch out there's some downsides
[01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:46.040]   but you know let's not deny that there's a few there they're positive features that make it very
[01:20:46.040 --> 01:20:50.360]   marketable because once you once you give up choices very hard to get back we have listened
[01:20:50.360 --> 01:20:56.600]   users like an opiate but less of disconnect from reality and gives them another world experience
[01:20:56.600 --> 01:21:01.960]   and so it's available now that's kind of how i feel about it but we'll see we'll see but i mean
[01:21:01.960 --> 01:21:05.880]   just just to say one last thing though as as a developer if i want to if i want to deal with an
[01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:09.880]   encryption technology or a security technology that's going to allow my my stuff you're talking
[01:21:09.880 --> 01:21:15.720]   about if i don't buy one off the shelf and pay 60 to 100 000 for an off the shelf security
[01:21:15.720 --> 01:21:19.160]   software i'm going to develop one at the cost of a quarter million to half million dollars
[01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:22.440]   and then people are going to crack it anyway you know and so the thing is is that the idea that
[01:21:22.440 --> 01:21:28.600]   it's all tied down is and i don't we don't spend that much money we you know the thing is is that
[01:21:28.600 --> 01:21:33.960]   but but i think that that is the i think that's what i can see from a developer's perspective
[01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:45.640]   what they would be very interested in is the idea that apple's gonna be on the f
[01:21:45.640 --> 01:21:50.680]   lesson valley it's you know it's the gated community and uh if and i think you're right i think that's
[01:21:50.680 --> 01:21:55.080]   what people want um so it's not what's good for us but i think it is what people want
[01:21:55.080 --> 01:22:00.200]   but on that note we're gonna have to wrap this up we will not do picks this week because uh we this
