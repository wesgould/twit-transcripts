[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   And this is a good week.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.280]   Oh my god, we've got like 25 people in the studio today.
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.120]   That's not that many.
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.240]   One, two, three, four, 15 people in the studio.
[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.160]   And--
[00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.280]   And they can actually say that they were just passing through.
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.320]   They literally--
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.120]   I came in and Tuesday we usually have four or five people.
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.280]   And there's three times that number, and I'm going, uh-oh.
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.440]   And then I realized, it's Macworld week.
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.120]   That's why all the Apple fans are in town.
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.760]   Andy Inako's going to be flying out on Wednesday.
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.200]   Yep, I am taking the comfortable flight tomorrow
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.440]   afternoon, I'll be in town Wednesday night.
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.800]   Great.
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.480]   Look forward to seeing you then.
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.880]   Adam Christensen flying up from San Diego tonight.
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.200]   Yep, or no tomorrow morning.
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.200]   Tomorrow morning.
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.440]   Yep, so everybody feels like it's been--
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.400]   It's been travel day.
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.040]   It all begins tomorrow.
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.520]   Mm-hmm.
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.360]   All right.
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.320]   Adam's from Matt Castacors, Alex Lindsey, also here.
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.960]   Thanks to all of you for joining us today.
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:22.400]   Before we get to the announcements of last week
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.200]   because those all came after last week's show,
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.640]   let's just talk about-- what is it?
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.200]   Ifan Expo, Macworld Expo, Iworld Expo.
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.120]   Matt--
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.160]   Matt, we were having this conversation,
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.560]   and we were talking about it before you came in.
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.600]   I had this conversation with some people this morning,
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:45.200]   and I think what we decided was it's Macworld, Iworld.
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.400]   And most people are still just calling it Macworld.
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.160]   But then it says the ultimate Ifan event.
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.880]   Yes.
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.800]   So it's a little bit of that as well.
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.760]   There's a lot of cross-branding going on.
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:57.240]   Yeah.
[00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.480]   They're mixing it up.
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.120]   That strikes me as a quifcation.
[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.720]   We're not sure exactly what we are,
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.400]   but we're in a transitional moment.
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.840]   We'll be one of these soon.
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.360]   Either way, if you like Mac and Tasha's
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.680]   and you like music, this is the place to go this week.
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.480]   Will there be any Mac and Tasha's?
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.480]   No, I'm probably not.
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.040]   So cross that one out.
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.520]   There'll be a couple--
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.480]   Nice idea, but--
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.360]   You know, no good couple of monitors stands.
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.800]   No, come on.
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:20.360]   There's got to be.
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.200]   Well, there's no Apple.
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:21.560]   We know that.
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:22.840]   But that's been a couple of years.
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:23.680]   We're used to that now.
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.200]   Well, I'm speaking about iCloud and--
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:29.480]   OK.
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:30.480]   --Lion.
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.400]   So there's a--
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.400]   Which track is that, the Ifan track?
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.440]   I believe that an Ifan ticket will get you
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.920]   to into that track, yes.
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.800]   But that's on Thursday afternoon.
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.480]   OK, excuse me, but this has gotten way confusing.
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.320]   So there's the--
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.480]   Ifan pass the all-access pass, the exhibits pass,
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.880]   the pre-conference workshops, Mac, IT.
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.800]   These are all different passes and vastly different prices.
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.040]   $25 to get into the exhibits.
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.080]   I don't even know what modest-- that's a party, right?
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.040]   Modest mass blast at the Warfield.
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.880]   The Ifan pass is very reasonable.
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.400]   100 bucks, that gives you--
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.200]   So there's a whole track Andy of stuff
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.080]   like you're going to be doing.
[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.800]   Right.
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.360]   But essentially, what's happened is that instead
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.800]   of having to spend $1,200 to get
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.440]   a week's worth of all you can eat training,
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.160]   they seem to have broken it up to the things that
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.760]   are more like public interest events
[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.480]   so that you can spend a little less--
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.760]   you can spend a lot less money, like $30, $40,
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.240]   and just get a track of things that
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.080]   are going to be interesting and informative,
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.720]   but not necessarily something that you'd
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.040]   be charging to your company as training expenses.
[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.360]   Hey, let me ask-- this would be good.
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.240]   This is a little bit of a little sample group.
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.520]   How many of you have the exhibits only pass?
[00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.200]   You're here for Mac World Year.
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.160]   Three of you.
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.000]   How many of you here have the Ifan pass?
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.240]   Two more of you.
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.640]   How many here have the all access pass?
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:54.240]   One more.
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.360]   So the rest of you are just kind of going to stand out front.
[00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.840]   Most of them are not--
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.200]   are the rest of you going to Mac World?
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.520]   No.
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.120]   So there's a number of people in not going to Mac World
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.760]   who are just here.
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.480]   But those of you who are going to Mac World, it's like 50, 50--
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:11.840]   So people are getting what they wanted.
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.800]   They're not being pushed into paying $1,200
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:16.320]   for something.
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.440]   $25 for the exhibit is fair, I think.
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.400]   Yeah, and usually, there's lots of oftentimes exhibit pass
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.320]   codes floating around.
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.000]   Right.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.800]   And actually, I think with the Ifan pass,
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.120]   so you get-- both of your talks are Ifan pass, right?
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.320]   Andy?
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.320]   Yes, we determined that, right?
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:33.760]   Yes.
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.680]   And there's film events, art showings.
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.360]   There's the Mac World, I World, Midway.
[00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.280]   Is that a carnival?
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.640]   Well, mostly, there's going to be a lot of geeks there anyway.
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.280]   Real like, pounding an ale into your head,
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:47.280]   kind of buying the--
[00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.440]   Is that true?
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.200]   Well, geek is a geek.
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.360]   Any time you get that sort of crossover appeal,
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.520]   you have geese and then you have geese.
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.880]   And then Mac casts Adam Christensen.
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:59.160]   Are you doing some talks?
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:05:59.960]   What are you doing at them?
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.600]   No, I'm not doing a talk this year.
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.240]   I'm going to be covering the event.
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.480]   You'll be there as a journalist.
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.320]   So that can't be there.
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:07.520]   Well, actually, I'm going to be up--
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.280]   we do the Mac Roundtable live recording.
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.400]   And I should be-- I'll be there for you.
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:13.400]   Where are you going to do that?
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:14.400]   Thursday.
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:15.560]   That's off.
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.840]   I think those are going to be off in conference rooms.
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.080]   I'm not entirely sure.
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.440]   I figured I'd figure it out when I got there.
[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:25.560]   It's totally different this year,
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.040]   so I don't know what you expect.
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.280]   I'm going to go and just enjoy it.
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:30.600]   No, it's going to be fun.
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:31.680]   What I normally do at that show.
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.080]   And this is what Paul Kent told us
[00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:34.960]   that they were going to do, which is basically--
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.040]   and it was what it has been for some years.
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.800]   It's really a gathering of Apple fans.
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.320]   Right.
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:44.280]   Although the world of Apple fans is so broadened
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:47.240]   in the last two years thanks to the iPhone and the iPad,
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.200]   that they are not the traditional Apple fan anymore.
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:50.720]   Right?
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:51.760]   Yeah, and I think that it's good.
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:55.360]   I mean, even in the eye-- what we saw in the eye lounge,
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:59.200]   per CES, and what we'll see probably more of in the--
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:03.080]   at Macworld and iWorld, is it's a chance for people
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.240]   to really play with all these cases and all these other things.
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.640]   So there is a good reason to go to the Expo
[00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:08.480]   if you have an iPhone, which a couple people have.
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.280]   I mean, it's done OK.
[00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.840]   And so you can-- instead of having to go to just the Apple
[00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.120]   store and see what they have or just something else,
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:18.880]   you can actually get a much wider view of everything
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:21.680]   that's being created in that ecosphere.
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:22.760]   And it's a big ecosphere.
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.320]   So people go to shop.
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:26.360]   I think a lot of people go into the Expo.
[00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:28.320]   They may be window shopping, but I think they're going
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:29.600]   to be looking and kicking tires.
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.720]   And typically, they're there ready to take your order.
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:36.800]   And how many do you think of this new crop of iOS users
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:39.160]   will be converted into--
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.440]   I mean, as somebody who bought a Mac in 1984,
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:43.840]   and you know this Adam and Andy, and I know you know this,
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:46.400]   Alex, that was a group.
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.520]   And we were all in that group, the early Mac adopters,
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:51.040]   who were passionate.
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:52.000]   We're the cult in Mac.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.400]   The guys who had the Apple shape, like the Andrew Conny's,
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.040]   Apple shaved in the back of our head.
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:58.720]   How many of this iOS group, there's
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:01.080]   a much more casual group?
[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:04.160]   People who use the iPad today maybe don't even really
[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.880]   know that they're in a cult.
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:08.840]   How many of them?
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:10.840]   How many of them do you think become
[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:12.880]   that, or does that matter?
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:14.400]   Or maybe that whole idea.
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.360]   I mean, I feel like we're a little bit of an acronym.
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.240]   Like people who used to go to the West Coast Computer Fair.
[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:20.080]   It's just a different--
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:21.720]   But I think there's some people that
[00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:23.720]   go and own fords, and then some people that are really
[00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:24.760]   into the board.
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:27.760]   So the thing is that I think that maybe it's 5% or 10%.
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:30.920]   But it's 5% or 10% of a pretty massive group of people
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:32.800]   that are really intense about it.
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:33.760]   It does change, though.
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.960]   If your Apple changes how you think about your customers,
[00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:37.280]   how you think about your business.
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:38.840]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:42.240]   And that was-- I've seen a lot of people with the iPad get
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:44.320]   enlightened and pulled into it.
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:47.080]   I've had a number of people come up to me and say, you know,
[00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:50.400]   I was Windows user, and I got an iPad, or an iPhone,
[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:51.520]   or an iPod.
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:55.880]   And then you get that trickle-down effect, right?
[00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:59.040]   Then maybe they get an iPod, and then they get an iPad,
[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:01.600]   and then they get a MacBook, and then a MacBook Air,
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:03.240]   and a Mac mid-me, and suddenly now they're
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:04.200]   buying a Mac for their wife.
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.560]   And I've heard that story over and over again.
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:09.560]   And what they always seem to come back to is, I never
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:11.880]   knew there was a better experience.
[00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:15.760]   And the iOS device exposed me to, wait, computing could be--
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:19.120]   you mean computing could be fun and better and more enjoyable.
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:21.720]   I overheard someone at the coffee shop
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:22.960]   when I was buying my coffee.
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:24.200]   Literally talking about it.
[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:26.080]   I think I'm moving that direction because I just
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:27.560]   want my stuff to work.
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:28.560]   You know, like, I just--
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:30.280]   Is that really the case now, though?
[00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:32.720]   I mean, that's what the person said for years.
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:33.400]   Well, I know.
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:33.920]   I'm not.
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:34.760]   Do not add.
[00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:36.320]   But for years, I think people just
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:37.520]   chose Windows because it was default.
[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:38.400]   You don't even think about it.
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:38.900]   It's Windows.
[00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:39.560]   That's what you did.
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:42.960]   I really think the gateway drug of iOS devices
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:46.240]   is the first time that their iPhone or their iPad goes wrong,
[00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:48.280]   and the first time they go into the Apple Store,
[00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:51.960]   and a guy or a woman just sort of goes there and fixes it,
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.840]   and doesn't charge anything for that.
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:55.560]   That means that a year later, when
[00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:57.200]   it's time to buy a new notebook, someone's
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.920]   going to remember that and think of both times
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:01.360]   that they try to go to Best Buy or wherever,
[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:04.120]   and got charged $100 to have their hard drive
[00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.240]   scanned for any nude pictures of themselves
[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.280]   that they might have taken.
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:09.400]   They could be taken to be shared online.
[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:11.080]   And I think that--
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:12.400]   It's a much better experience.
[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:15.560]   I think that when you're in the Apple ecosystem,
[00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:17.480]   it's an easy way to impress your customer
[00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:19.600]   with how good that a company takes care of you.
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:23.280]   Well, I think also, for the technical person,
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:26.200]   Windows is just as secure as the Mac.
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:28.840]   But I know a lot of non-technical people and Windows
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:29.520]   is not.
[00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:31.240]   That's changing so rapidly.
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:33.400]   But I mean, you've got to acknowledge that that is changing.
[00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:34.440]   But I just-- I talked to one--
[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:36.280]   I think the distinction between Macs and Windows
[00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:39.640]   has become mostly academic at this point.
[00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:40.920]   I mean, I do not.
[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:41.440]   Maybe I'm not--
[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:41.960]   I don't know.
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:44.440]   All I know is that a week doesn't go by that I
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:47.440]   talk to a client that is sitting there now rebuilding
[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:49.920]   their PC and asking me how to--
[00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:51.960]   like, oh, I can't do that because I have to rebuild my PC
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:54.280]   because I've got all these viruses and I've got all that.
[00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:55.480]   And it's just--
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:56.400]   Literally, not a week.
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:57.320]   No, I should be clear.
[00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:58.120]   I only use Macs.
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:59.680]   I have Windows machines all over the place.
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:01.840]   We use Windows in the business office here.
[00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:03.560]   But given the choice, I always use Mac.
[00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:05.800]   But I'm not sure how much of that is habit at this point
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:07.440]   and how much of it is that there is a--
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:08.600]   there's a significant--
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.480]   Then I have-- I have Windows on every Mac that I have.
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:11.120]   You've seen this picture.
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:13.800]   I'm trying to find it now in G+, it's a classroom.
[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:16.080]   It's a college classroom.
[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.200]   Have you seen this picture?
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:18.080]   And it's all apples.
[00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:19.720]   It's like 150 people.
[00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:22.880]   All apples, there's one guy with an Asus in the middle.
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:24.200]   And it's such a funny picture.
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:25.600]   And I'm trying to find it, but I can't.
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:28.120]   I certainly agree that the gap has become a lot more narrow.
[00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:29.760]   I don't think it's purely academic.
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:34.000]   But now, we're asked 10 years ago, maybe even five years ago,
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.080]   I could simply say, oh, god, no, there's no difference.
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:36.600]   Freedom.
[00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:38.680]   There's such a huge difference in--
[00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:40.560]   use a building between a Mac and a Windows machine
[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:43.040]   that you'd have to have a good reason to go with Windows.
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:44.960]   Like everyone in your office uses one,
[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:46.840]   and they won't let you use virtualization.
[00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:49.120]   Now, I still think that the Mac is easier to use.
[00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:51.120]   I still think it's more reliable.
[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:54.320]   But it's close enough now that if you said, yeah,
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:57.880]   but what I really want is a nice slim compact device,
[00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:01.200]   and I don't necessarily want to spend $1,000 or $1,200
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:05.960]   on a MacBook Air, here's a nice Asus device that costs about $799.
[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:07.640]   And I can actually afford it.
[00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:09.760]   Then I'll say, yeah, OK, maybe.
[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:10.800]   Sure.
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:13.040]   Windows 7 isn't quite a slick, but Windows 7
[00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:15.200]   will keep another $400 in your pocket.
[00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.600]   So here's a number of people, including Scooter X,
[00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:18.560]   have posted this.
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:21.120]   Oh, but it's kind of a low res.
[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:22.360]   But this is--
[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:23.800]   I mean, but--
[00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:27.920]   And I don't know if this is because they're all--
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:29.400]   it's hip to have an Apple, or if there really
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:30.400]   is a legitimate difference.
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:31.240]   But there's this one guy.
[00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:32.240]   He's right here.
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:34.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:36.560]   And it's all-- it must be interesting to be a college
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:37.600]   professor these days.
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.640]   And look, there's another-- there's one other Windows.
[00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:42.120]   And how do we know he's not running a hack and touch?
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:45.040]   That's true.
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:49.240]   And yet, Apple's market share certainly doesn't reflect this.
[00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:51.320]   Unless you count iPads.
[00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:51.960]   Right.
[00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:56.760]   Now, with iPads, you're suddenly in the ballpark, right?
[00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:59.880]   Here's a high res version of the same picture,
[00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:01.080]   so you can see it.
[00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:03.880]   I love it.
[00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:05.320]   The one guy with the aces.
[00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:09.040]   Actually, it's a girl.
[00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:12.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:15.000]   Maybe there's a few other-- that might be a Windows machine.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.200]   Well, I think part of it is also the branding that Apple
[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:20.720]   does, where you have having that nice big logo that's lit up.
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:21.720]   It's smart, isn't it?
[00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:22.720]   It makes that much clearer.
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:23.400]   It's smart.
[00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:25.520]   Yeah.
[00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:27.720]   Well, it does change--
[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:29.120]   I mean, it's kind of an academic question,
[00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:30.320]   but it's an interesting question to me,
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:33.080]   especially as we go into this I-fan event.
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:34.280]   Who are the Apple fans?
[00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:36.680]   How are they quantitatively different than they were 5 and 10
[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:38.800]   and 15 and 20 years ago?
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:40.880]   And how does this change how Apple does its business?
[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:42.840]   Certainly, Apple is cognizant.
[00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:44.800]   They took computer off the name.
[00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:47.040]   They really seem less focused on OS 10
[00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:48.280]   and Macintosh than ever.
[00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:51.280]   They still sell a lot of the errors.
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:52.280]   By the way, an interesting thing,
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:54.360]   it's CES to see all of these error wannabes.
[00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:55.640]   And it's just blatant.
[00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:57.040]   It's like--
[00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:58.520]   No, we look just like an error.
[00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:01.280]   I mean, they don't even try.
[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:03.580]   Well, someone asked me, like, they said,
[00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:04.120]   it looks just like it.
[00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:05.680]   And the price wasn't that much different.
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:07.120]   I was like, why don't you just-- no, some of them are cheaper.
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:09.120]   They're so much cheaper, but I mean, it's--
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:10.320]   It's in the $1,000 range.
[00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:11.800]   But I was like, yes, we're--
[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:14.400]   You just put Windows on your air and then you're fine.
[00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:17.720]   Anyway, so you still have the same form factor.
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:22.880]   I have to say, I think that it is a change, kind of a change
[00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:27.920]   in the weather that maybe Apple and its users should
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:28.720]   be somewhat aware of.
[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:30.480]   But let's go to the I fan event and find out,
[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:31.360]   because that's where the--
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:34.560]   That's where the hardcore-- I got Apple's shave
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:35.480]   in the back of my head.
[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:36.840]   And I think that it's less geeky.
[00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:38.760]   The one thing that I noticed about going to--
[00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:39.280]   Is it?
[00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:40.120]   Well, I use the deals.
[00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:43.280]   When I went to-- I actually spoke at a Windows--
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:46.760]   at a Microsoft conference maybe 12 years ago.
[00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:48.680]   And the one thing I noticed was everyone was in suits.
[00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:51.000]   I mean, it was all the admin guys.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:51.680]   You know, everyone--
[00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:52.680]   It is.
[00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:53.840]   Like everyone was in suits.
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:56.840]   And so everyone was in suits.
[00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:59.520]   And everyone was the guys who ran the company that
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:01.360]   had all these things everywhere.
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:06.880]   And when I went to Macworld, it was all of these real people
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:08.360]   that hack their computer--
[00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:10.080]   that customize their own computers,
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:12.760]   customize what they're doing, and so on and so forth.
[00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:14.520]   And I think that now we're going to get to something that's
[00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:15.600]   much more consumer.
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:18.680]   And people who want to find cases for their iPad.
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:21.360]   Well, I think also on the education side,
[00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:23.120]   and looking at the mix of what they've done,
[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:26.680]   they're taking into account this changing dynamic of the type
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:28.720]   of person who is an app baloner.
[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.280]   And they're doing a lot more stuff
[00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:32.560]   on the creative side with music and art
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:34.680]   and kind of focusing on the experience
[00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:35.880]   and what you do with these things.
[00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:37.640]   And I've seen a lot of sessions that are--
[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:41.040]   and things that they're doing, like creating artwork on iPads
[00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:43.480]   and having an art gallery and doing music stuff
[00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:45.160]   and kind of trying to really mix it up
[00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:48.840]   and make it more about the fan experience.
[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:52.160]   And you still have those tracks where there's Mac stuff,
[00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:54.480]   and they have the IT track for the IT guys.
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:57.520]   But they're recognizing it's maybe a little smaller percentage
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:02.800]   of the mix as opposed to what it was three, five years ago.
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:04.560]   Yeah.
[00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:06.240]   Although I have to say it's a little disappointing when
[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:07.360]   you go to the--
[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:10.560]   OK, I love Paul Kent.
[00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:11.520]   And I love Macworld.
[00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:13.080]   But I have to say it's a little disappointing
[00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:14.120]   when you go to the show floor.
[00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:17.680]   It's iPhone case after iPhone case after iPad case after iPad case.
[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:18.200]   Yes.
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:19.720]   Yes, that's very tedious.
[00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:22.240]   I love going to the back, Tiny Town, what Merlin
[00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:23.520]   managed to call Tiny Town.
[00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:24.000]   Tiny Town.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.760]   The little developers who don't even have booze,
[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:27.800]   they just have stands.
[00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:30.120]   It's-- that is more like the old days.
[00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:32.080]   It shows that there are still small companies
[00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:34.680]   doing interesting stuff.
[00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:37.480]   But you don't see-- Microsoft's not there.
[00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:40.680]   You don't see-- is it Adobe there anymore?
[00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:42.880]   I bet not.
[00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:45.800]   You don't see these big companies.
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:48.480]   You don't see Apple.
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:51.800]   It just feels to me like, does this
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:53.280]   represent the Apple community?
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:54.280]   I think in a way it does.
[00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:57.800]   It's the-- it's the generalization of Apple.
[00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:00.640]   And I think that you still have this connection.
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:02.440]   When you're in the airport and you see it,
[00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:07.120]   and you need to move outlets around to get plugged in.
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:09.000]   As a Mac user, you always look for other Mac users.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:09.560]   I mean--
[00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:10.360]   Because they're nicer?
[00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:11.280]   Yeah, they're nicer.
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:12.400]   They're not going to sneer at you.
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:13.920]   They're not-- you're right.
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:16.280]   It's still a little bit of a community, a little bit of a--
[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:17.280]   So I think there's a culture.
[00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:19.920]   I think that there's a culture there that is the--
[00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:21.520]   like South by Southwest has a culture.
[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:22.640]   And other things have a culture.
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:25.240]   I think that there's a culture there that is a certain--
[00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:27.760]   I don't know whether they really are the same as homogeneous
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:29.720]   as they used to be, which I think is good probably.
[00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:31.080]   But there are a lot of different folks that
[00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:33.240]   are connected via their devices.
[00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:35.480]   And if they show up there, they're probably arrogant
[00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:36.160]   about their devices.
[00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:37.960]   Canoo says-- and I guess this is the fundamental question.
[00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:39.040]   Is Apple-- and you're the--
[00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:41.640]   you're the-- got asked-- is Apple alienating its pro users
[00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:43.480]   by paying so much attention to the consumer side?
[00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:45.480]   Well, a lot of us want something else,
[00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:46.760]   but there's nowhere else to go.
[00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:47.480]   That's a good point.
[00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:50.480]   So it's not-- what about Linux?
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:50.840]   Linux.
[00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:51.560]   What about Linux?
[00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:53.640]   I keep on looking at Linux.
[00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:55.000]   For a lot of our tools, the problem
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.120]   is I'm not going to get my Adobe products on there.
[00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:58.920]   So it's not-- so you--
[00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:02.800]   What's it to be smart for Adobe to start developing for Linux?
[00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:04.000]   It's so much work.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:04.640]   It's too much work.
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:05.280]   It's so much code.
[00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:05.840]   But it would be--
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:06.320]   It's probably--
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:08.960]   It's like less than 1% of the desktop market.
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:13.200]   The problem that Adobe has is that they have so much code.
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:16.160]   You know, like changing anything is big ship.
[00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:17.400]   There are-- at this point, there
[00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:21.480]   are no great open source Unix or Linux based alternatives
[00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:23.520]   for kind of those fundamental programs.
[00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:25.040]   You know, people are--
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:25.080]   It's not--
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:25.080]   It's not--
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:25.080]   It's not--
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:25.080]   It's not--
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:25.580]   It's not--
[00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:26.080]   It's not--
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:26.580]   It's the game.
[00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:29.200]   But it's not the same as Photoshop.
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:30.840]   There's-- you know, there are a number
[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:32.520]   of actually interesting editing programs,
[00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:35.080]   but nothing like Premiere.
[00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:36.520]   Well, and there's no market for it now.
[00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:38.520]   I mean, the thing is is that we final cut it
[00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:40.120]   at $300.
[00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:41.240]   You know, there is--
[00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:42.760]   there's a high end market for Avid.
[00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:45.480]   There is an integrated market for Adobe,
[00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:48.240]   and then there's the rest of the market that Apple has taken.
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:49.240]   You know, and it's--
[00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:51.120]   It seems like an opportunity for somebody.
[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:51.920]   Just saying.
[00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:52.720]   There's some-- the markets.
[00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:54.440]   We are going to also be at Macworld.
[00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:58.560]   We are doing iPad today from the show floor to Thursday,
[00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:00.160]   I should say.
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:02.040]   Sarah Lane and I will be wandering the show floor.
[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:03.720]   We have the-- you know, the--
[00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:05.560]   are we going to broadcast that live right now?
[00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:07.080]   Oh, Eileen's not there.
[00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:08.360]   Liz?
[00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:09.040]   OK.
[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:10.520]   So we will be broadcasting that live,
[00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:16.960]   and we will also be recording it for later download.
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:19.480]   And then we're having a party Thursday night, which
[00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:23.640]   is going to be a lot of fun, at the Intercontinental Hotel,
[00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:24.480]   6 p.m.
[00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:29.120]   So if you are here for Mac break, even if you're not,
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:31.960]   it's not-- now I'm told there's-- it's not an open bar.
[00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:34.560]   It's a cash bar.
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:35.400]   Keep in control of it.
[00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:36.480]   OK, just have to know.
[00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:37.680]   I don't know what that means.
[00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:38.680]   We're not paying for it.
[00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:39.360]   That's all I care about.
[00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:40.200]   All right, thank you.
[00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:41.240]   You can buy a drink.
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.560]   But I did say, I said, if you said something on iPad
[00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:45.480]   the day, I said there was a secret code.
[00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:46.760]   And if you said that secret--
[00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:48.400]   I don't which I don't remember, but if you say that secret
[00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:50.520]   code to me, I will buy you a drink.
[00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:51.320]   Wow.
[00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:52.360]   But I don't remember what it is.
[00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:54.120]   Now everybody's going to go back and watch that.
[00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:54.920]   No, you know what?
[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:57.400]   If you're smart, all you go is you'll say, ishkabibble,
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:58.960]   that's the secret code.
[00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:00.480]   And I'll go, oh, because I don't remember.
[00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:02.600]   OK, let me buy you a drink.
[00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:04.840]   We're going to talk about the big announcements, which
[00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:07.160]   were on Thursday.
[00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:08.160]   It's interesting.
[00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:09.800]   Apple, even though they didn't want to be at Macworld
[00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:11.400]   because they didn't want to be pushed to make big
[00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:13.760]   announcements this early in the year,
[00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:15.560]   does seem to make big announcements this early in the year
[00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:17.880]   anyway, just not in Macworld.
[00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:19.360]   I think they just didn't like the pressure.
[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:20.480]   It's too much pressure.
[00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:21.200]   I can't take it.
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:22.200]   You have to remember that also, I
[00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:24.440]   booth the size that Apple does with the number of employees
[00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:25.160]   that are expensive.
[00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:26.880]   You're talking about $5 million.
[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:29.160]   Yeah, but I only feel like they should do it just
[00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:30.120]   to support the community.
[00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:31.080]   You're not doing it.
[00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:33.800]   Obviously, it's not marketing valuable in terms
[00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:35.320]   of announcing new things.
[00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:36.720]   But it sure did support the community.
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:40.520]   It may-- you suck the window of the sales if you're not there.
[00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:42.920]   Just seems to me, but that's my thoughts.
[00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:44.440]   We're talking about Ford right now.
[00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:48.960]   You said if there's Ford users, and then there's Ford lovers.
[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:50.200]   There's a lot of Ford lovers now.
[00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:51.160]   I'm a Ford lover now.
[00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:53.200]   Everybody here is a Ford lover.
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:55.880]   We love the Ford technology.
[00:20:55.880 --> 00:21:01.440]   I drive a 2010 Mustang, a GT premium that I love.
[00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:04.680]   And one of the things that Ford's doing that's so interesting
[00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:08.800]   is you start to see the strategy.
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:10.920]   You've got a guy like Alan Malawi as a CEO of Ford.
[00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:13.280]   You start to see--
[00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:14.840]   It's got a plan.
[00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:15.600]   There's a plan.
[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:16.960]   It's funny.
[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:18.160]   Every company should have a plan.
[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:21.160]   But it's so rare that when somebody actually seems to have
[00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:24.480]   a plan, it's like, wow, there was a thought point.
[00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:26.960]   So there's a whole idea.
[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:29.560]   So it started with Ford Sync, which I love in my Mustang,
[00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:30.800]   and my Ford Touch.
[00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:32.960]   And then now with AppLink, the idea
[00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:35.000]   is we're getting the cabin of these cars
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.840]   into the 21st century, while Mossberg says he says,
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:40.720]   until Sync came along, you'd get in a car,
[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:42.360]   you'd be back in the 1950s.
[00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:43.640]   You're driving along disconnected.
[00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:45.400]   Now you're connected to the world.
[00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:48.600]   But the problem-- and they're thinking a lot about this.
[00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:52.040]   And I've spoken to Alan a couple of times about it--
[00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:55.040]   is safety, and there's a huge issue of distracted driving.
[00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:57.160]   So how do we keep you in touch?
[00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:59.640]   Because that's what consumers want.
[00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:02.920]   But without making it difficult, without making it dangerous,
[00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:04.280]   without distracting you.
[00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:05.560]   And they've done a lot of research.
[00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:08.480]   And the research says, according to Alan,
[00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:10.160]   if you've got your eyes on the road,
[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:12.160]   your paying attention, your hands on the wheel,
[00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:15.680]   you still have the cognitive ability to make phone calls.
[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:18.800]   That's why to listen to music, the key
[00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:20.640]   is to keep you from looking down twiddling dials,
[00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:21.440]   looking at screens.
[00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:22.760]   You've got to keep your eyes on the road
[00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:23.960]   and your hands on the wheel.
[00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:25.680]   So that's the whole idea behind Ford Sync
[00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:28.320]   is you speak to your car, and it listens,
[00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:30.240]   and it does what you ask it to do.
[00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:32.560]   You could set the cabin temperature, get weather forecasts.
[00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:33.920]   You can get hard scopes.
[00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:34.840]   You can listen to music.
[00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:35.800]   You can make phone calls.
[00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:37.000]   It's the whole variety.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.600]   So you're still connected, but you're talking to the car.
[00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:42.520]   Now this app link thing is a perfect example.
[00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:45.160]   App link, and you'll find it in the 2012 Ford Fiesta
[00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:48.760]   at Ford.com/technology if you want to learn more,
[00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:52.760]   lets you control smartphone apps with voice commands,
[00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:54.600]   without, again, taking your hands off the wheel
[00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:55.840]   or the eyes off the road.
[00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:58.080]   Pandora, they announced at CES,
[00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:01.480]   I think a half dozen new apps that go with App Link.
[00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:04.640]   So you could say, you know, play Pandora,
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:06.400]   I want to hear my classic rock station,
[00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:07.240]   it'll start playing.
[00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:08.960]   This is, again, I should always do this.
[00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:11.280]   I want to hear my classic rock station.
[00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:13.120]   And you hear a song you like, thumbs up.
[00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:14.840]   You hear a song you don't like thumbs down.
[00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:16.440]   And you're talking to it, and it's listening.
[00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:18.800]   You can even say bookmark this song and buy it.
[00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:20.040]   So if you like a song, you could say,
[00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:21.720]   I want to buy that later.
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:24.560]   They've got open beak that reads your tweets,
[00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:26.320]   the timelines or replies to you.
[00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:29.080]   You cannot tweet, because that would be dangerous.
[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:32.880]   He's a guy talking to his car.
[00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:35.800]   And it's an API platform, so they've got,
[00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:37.640]   I wish I could find the list.
[00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:39.560]   Let me see if I can find the list.
[00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:41.560]   Stitcher, slacker.
[00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:46.240]   There are a number of apps coming out all the time,
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:49.480]   and I'm sure that somewhere at sync,
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:51.680]   there's a list of all the apps now.
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:53.760]   Tune in radio, I'd love to tune in radio.
[00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:54.600]   Have you ever used that?
[00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:56.360]   Tune in radio, it's the best radio app.
[00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:59.880]   50,000, this is gonna kill my bosses
[00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:01.600]   at the radio station.
[00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:02.720]   (laughs)
[00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:05.880]   But truthfully, internet radio in a car,
[00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:07.240]   like it's transformational, right?
[00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:09.080]   There we go, thank you.
[00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:12.520]   iHeartRadio, slacker, Stitcher,
[00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:15.840]   and what's not on there yet is they just announced
[00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:19.680]   Tune in radio, and more, all the time more.
[00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:20.560]   And this is the beauty of it.
[00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:23.480]   Your smartphone gets updated, they don't have to update the car,
[00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:25.040]   but gives you complete control,
[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:26.840]   connection with the outside world.
[00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:28.920]   Take a look at App Link and all the great features
[00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:31.480]   at Ford.com/technology,
[00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:34.080]   and of course at your 2012 Ford Fiesta
[00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:37.160]   is at your Ford dealer, so drive one today.
[00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:39.240]   Let me thank Ford for their support.
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:42.880]   Ford is one of those brands, it's not quite Apple,
[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:45.560]   but it's like one of those brands, it's known globally.
[00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:46.400]   They're Apple-esque.
[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:47.240]   They're Apple-esque.
[00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:48.480]   I think there's a lot of brands that you think about
[00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:50.240]   that are the Apple of their industry.
[00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:51.240]   It's the Apple of the auto-sugar.
[00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:53.560]   They're definitely the Apple of the auto-sugar.
[00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:56.200]   Well, people sometimes say Apple is the BMW
[00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:57.360]   of the computer industry.
[00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:00.800]   But I don't think BMW is the Apple of the car industry.
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:03.360]   All right, moving on, let's talk about the announcement.
[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:05.080]   Andy, did you go, you're close to New York,
[00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:07.040]   did you get on the train?
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:07.960]   No, I didn't go.
[00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:09.440]   We didn't get on the train.
[00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:10.920]   (laughing)
[00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:13.480]   Well, it was 10 AM, you know, that was quite--
[00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:14.320]   I know.
[00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:15.160]   It's kind of early for me.
[00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:16.000]   I know.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.880]   We went back and forth and talked about,
[00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:21.760]   you can give me my coffee, that I need.
[00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:23.880]   Thank you, John, thank you so much.
[00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:26.720]   We went back and forth about weather
[00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:28.680]   to cover it live.
[00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:30.640]   And I'm a mixed feelings.
[00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:32.840]   It was mostly why we didn't--
[00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:33.840]   Seven AM.
[00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:34.680]   Seven AM.
[00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:36.000]   I'm lazy.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   I don't want to get up.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:38.480]   I would've had to get up at five.
[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:39.320]   Go in.
[00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:40.160]   Yeah, call my camera.
[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:42.160]   Well, actually, it kind of paid off that I didn't go
[00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:46.960]   because it really was one of those rare times where
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:49.760]   there's an event happening like a 10 AM
[00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:51.040]   that I'm not physically attending,
[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:52.360]   but I'm covering it remotely.
[00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:56.600]   And so woke up at like 8.39, spent an hour doing email,
[00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:58.200]   said, well, I'll just--
[00:25:58.200 --> 00:25:59.400]   I'll watch the thing, and then afterward,
[00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:01.760]   I'll get out of bed, shower, shave, good breakfast.
[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:06.960]   And then by 10, 30, 10, 45, I was downloading the app.
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:08.600]   And what was the little rest of it?
[00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:10.760]   And then playing with it for the two hours,
[00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:12.400]   and then finally, holy crap, it's like 130.
[00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:13.720]   I haven't been out of bed yet.
[00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:16.800]   I gave the day started on my way towards writing a column
[00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:18.880]   about it during our long podcast about it
[00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:22.520]   and doing an NPR phone interview about it.
[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:24.520]   The life of a journalist, isn't it?
[00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:26.000]   Great kids.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.840]   It's a lot like being you have to only
[00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:31.080]   without the naked women, the wealth, the fame,
[00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:32.080]   the notoriety.
[00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:36.440]   Oh, but the idea of spending the entire day in your pajamas.
[00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:37.520]   So that part was bought off.
[00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:39.640]   But I took advantage of this too, because I was at home.
[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:41.720]   And I watched-- I think the Verge had good coverage,
[00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:43.240]   very good coverage, and gadget.
[00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:44.480]   They all did, right?
[00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:47.200]   All the blogs did their live streaming thing.
[00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:48.320]   I watched The Verge.
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:49.120]   What did you watch, Andy?
[00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:50.920]   You probably watched them all, right?
[00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:52.760]   I had one window open with The Verge,
[00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:54.600]   and one window, I think, with Macworld.
[00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:55.400]   I saw--
[00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:58.400]   Oh, Macworld magazine, I should have watched them shoot.
[00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:01.120]   At a very small room, I can't remember--
[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:02.480]   Oh, it's time to see.
[00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:05.640]   Either event I attended or either just an event
[00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:08.160]   that I watched, where they had it in such a small room.
[00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:11.520]   I think it was something like maybe four dozen, five dozen
[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:12.480]   people.
[00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:15.120]   So small that you could look at the picture of it
[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:18.120]   and see everybody and see, oh, there's M.G. Seagler.
[00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:20.800]   Oh, there's Natalie and Clayton Morris.
[00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:21.320]   Oh, that's like--
[00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:22.720]   You know, it's like--
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:23.320]   It was small.
[00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:24.720]   It was that small.
[00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:25.720]   Yeah.
[00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:27.600]   Sometimes I wonder whether Apple is going to go that direction.
[00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:31.760]   And where those events become smaller and smaller.
[00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:33.440]   Well, I think because it was a textbook event,
[00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:35.600]   everybody thought it was going to be kind of an inside,
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:36.520]   baseball-y event.
[00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:37.000]   But it wasn't.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   I think it may have been a-- it was a huge announcement.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:39.600]   I think.
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:41.480]   I'm going to go on-- I don't know, let me say it's
[00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:43.120]   a huge announcement.
[00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:44.280]   Did you watch it at home?
[00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:45.080]   I presume you did.
[00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:46.040]   Yeah, same thing.
[00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:49.880]   The Verge and Macworld, and I forget how many tabs I had opened.
[00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:52.120]   But whoever I could get a feed from, yeah.
[00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:53.560]   Right.
[00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:57.560]   So I'll boil it down, and you can correct me or add on.
[00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:59.680]   There were, in my opinion, three announcements.
[00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:02.240]   And Apple buried the lead a little bit.
[00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:05.360]   So announcement number one was iBooks 2.
[00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:07.680]   And the addition of a textbook store to iBooks 2.
[00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:09.280]   And more than just a textbook store,
[00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:14.120]   I mean, these textbooks are kind of revolutionary.
[00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:15.040]   They're multimedia.
[00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:15.680]   They have video.
[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:17.120]   They have interactivity.
[00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:18.560]   They're cheap.
[00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:20.760]   Now, I don't know how long this is going to but last.
[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:22.720]   But $14.99 or less.
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:26.640]   They started with E.O. Wilson's amazing biodiversity.
[00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:27.760]   A couple of chapters of that.
[00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:30.520]   And it's a really good example if you haven't downloaded it.
[00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:32.200]   It's just gorgeous.
[00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:34.720]   Here, I'll plow my iPad and start playing through it
[00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:36.880]   a little bit.
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:38.280]   So that was announcement number one.
[00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:39.800]   We're going to have a textbook store.
[00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:40.640]   And we're going to sell textbooks.
[00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:43.280]   And they had the three big textbook publishers, Pearson,
[00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:48.120]   Harkhort, Brace, Jovonovich, Govovovich, Milo,
[00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:49.280]   I don't know what the name of it is.
[00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:52.200]   And then Pearson.
[00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:54.440]   And a Houghton Mifflin--
[00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:55.680]   Houghton Mifflin--
[00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:58.040]   Harkhort, Scrabble-likeum.
[00:28:58.040 --> 00:28:58.680]   Harkhort, I think.
[00:28:58.680 --> 00:28:59.120]   Harkhort.
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:00.960]   I can't keep track of it anymore.
[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:02.480]   Harkhort used to be Harkhort, Brace.
[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:03.960]   And now it's something else.
[00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:04.320]   I don't know.
[00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:05.840]   I'm old.
[00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:07.560]   And let me just type in my password.
[00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:10.320]   We can get in here.
[00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:11.720]   So that's big.
[00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:13.800]   That's like 90% of all textbooks.
[00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:18.120]   Now, I got a little point out thing,
[00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:20.000]   which is that the textbooks that were on there--
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.600]   and I played with them, and they're amazing, they're wonderful--
[00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:24.720]   they were what they called a core curriculum.
[00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:27.240]   And now, you have to understand how textbook industry works
[00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:29.600]   to understand why this is kind of critical.
[00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:32.280]   Unfortunately, one of the reasons textbooks are so expensive
[00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:34.080]   is you have to go to the school boards--
[00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:36.120]   this is for K through 12--
[00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:40.120]   of the state and get approval before the state--
[00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:41.760]   education is very state-specific.
[00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:43.640]   There's no national thing.
[00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:46.760]   So what happens is they go to the California--
[00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:47.880]   So this is part of why--
[00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:49.440]   This is part of why it's so screwed up.
[00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:50.640]   It's exactly why it's so screwed.
[00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:51.920]   They go to the Texas School Board,
[00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:53.840]   and each has their own demands, and they make a Texas School
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:55.360]   book, and they make a California School book.
[00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:57.280]   But there's a core text, and that's what you're getting.
[00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:01.160]   So as it stands for 1499, right now, what you're getting
[00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:04.560]   is not something that you could use in a California school--
[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:08.360]   In a California standard public school non-charter.
[00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:08.880]   Right.
[00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:10.840]   So a charter school could use it.
[00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:11.640]   Oh, OK.
[00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:15.000]   So charters-- and I presume that means private schools get it.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.040]   But not a California public school.
[00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:18.680]   So it says a line to-- you'll see in the--
[00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:19.760]   Can you get that over the shoulder?
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:20.840]   I don't know if you can get that.
[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:22.760]   It says a line to the common core.
[00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:27.240]   I think it's over here.
[00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:31.240]   Which means, by the way, if you don't care,
[00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:32.440]   you're getting a-- there it is.
[00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:33.200]   But that's--
[00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:33.840]   That's mine.
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:34.280]   Oh, well.
[00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:35.960]   If you want to hand it to me, I'll throw it.
[00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:42.400]   If you don't care, you're getting a $14.99 textbook.
[00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:43.720]   That's the algebra 1 textbook.
[00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:47.440]   Oh, the other thing I love is free samples.
[00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:50.800]   So you get a really good idea of how it works.
[00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:55.240]   Now, this is an example--
[00:30:55.240 --> 00:31:00.040]   if you go back a little bit, where there's an example,
[00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:03.760]   unfortunately, it would be nice if you could type in stuff.
[00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:05.760]   Right now, the way it kind of does it for you.
[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:09.280]   But that's nice.
[00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:10.600]   You could see how a slope--
[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:11.640]   I mean, I think that's great.
[00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:13.160]   And this is usually, I believe, the widget.
[00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:14.800]   This is usually the dashboard dashcode.
[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:15.840]   Well, we're going to talk about that
[00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:17.480]   because the second announcement--
[00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:19.000]   Alex is now an expert on this--
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:24.560]   is an authoring tool, a free authoring tool called Author.
[00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:27.320]   Now, this has been very controversial.
[00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:28.800]   And we'll talk about that in a second.
[00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:30.320]   And then the third announcement, which I think
[00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:32.560]   was the most important announcement, at least
[00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:38.040]   for the world as a whole, is a separate iTunes U, K through 12
[00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:40.960]   support, support for a lot more features in iTunes U
[00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:43.840]   than just playing back a video or audio lecture.
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:47.400]   It turns iTunes U into an amazing educational tool.
[00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:51.040]   One thing I'm not clear about is, can non-schools
[00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:53.160]   like, can corporations use iTunes U?
[00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:53.720]   I don't know.
[00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:55.400]   Why, they really should let them.
[00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:56.480]   Well, friend, OK.
[00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:57.480]   Yeah.
[00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:58.440]   They should really let them.
[00:31:58.440 --> 00:31:58.800]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:00.440]   Now, Web 1100 said I got it wrong.
[00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:03.480]   Common core, is he opposite of what I'm saying?
[00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:05.680]   I think it's the stuff that is not state specific.
[00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:07.560]   Is it not?
[00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:09.000]   Otherwise, it wouldn't make any sense.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.400]   Maybe they misnamed it.
[00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:13.440]   No, he's not explaining.
[00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:15.440]   But I think that's the idea of Common Core,
[00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:17.680]   is it's everything except the California editions
[00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:18.760]   or the Texas editions.
[00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:21.320]   But that means you wouldn't be able to use it in those states.
[00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:24.520]   If I'm wrong on that, I would love to be.
[00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:25.960]   Common Core is a national movement
[00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:27.440]   to align state standards.
[00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:27.880]   Oh, OK.
[00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:28.840]   How far is that gone?
[00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:34.400]   It's government so we can probably--
[00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:36.040]   How's that working out for?
[00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:38.440]   But here's one of the arguments that's going to come up,
[00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:40.800]   is that it may move a lot faster when you suddenly
[00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:42.040]   have all these interactive books coming.
[00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:43.880]   And your school system gets left out.
[00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:46.720]   This weighs a lot less than a backpack with five books.
[00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:48.520]   And suddenly, you start seeing students using this,
[00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:50.000]   and their test scores going up.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.960]   And suddenly, the pressure on school boards will be intense.
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:54.200]   I mean, this will be--
[00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:55.960]   they'll be told I need to figure out
[00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:58.160]   how to make this work because their students are falling
[00:32:58.160 --> 00:32:58.640]   behind.
[00:32:58.640 --> 00:32:59.600]   This is another example.
[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:00.960]   This is from the E.O. Wilson book.
[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:02.000]   You can slide this along.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.640]   This is worldwide photosynthetic activity.
[00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:06.640]   This is seasonally--
[00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:08.280]   Things like this, a textbook just can't do.
[00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:10.880]   Now, I think these are kind of trivial,
[00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:12.800]   but they're going to get less trivial as people really
[00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:13.600]   start to play this.
[00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:14.040]   This is the first try.
[00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:15.200]   Yeah.
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:16.760]   Oh, and this is what I like now.
[00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:19.520]   So your finger is an underliner.
[00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:22.560]   So-- and this-- boy, I wish we'd had this when I was in school.
[00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:25.360]   So here's something on the Photix Zone.
[00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:27.880]   I really want to remember this Photix Zone.
[00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:29.960]   I'm going to put that right there and underline it.
[00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:33.960]   Now-- this is the best part.
[00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:36.960]   This is making study cards out of it.
[00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:39.320]   So these are my notes.
[00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:40.640]   And I can go to my study cards.
[00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:43.320]   Now, the study cards will include stuff
[00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:45.680]   that the publishers put in their glossary terms.
[00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:46.880]   What's an endomologist?
[00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:48.880]   A biologist who studies insects.
[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:50.680]   So I mean, this is a great way to study.
[00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:55.040]   But also, the stuff I underlined is now in here.
[00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:59.120]   So as I underline, I'm making my own study cards.
[00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:03.440]   My highlights and notes become study cards.
[00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:03.800]   So--
[00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:05.120]   And that-- go ahead.
[00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:06.320]   It's not just that.
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:10.360]   It's the idea that the kid gets to keep this book.
[00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:11.280]   It's their property.
[00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:13.040]   They can own it for life.
[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:14.880]   And not only will they have the book forever,
[00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:16.920]   but they'll also have all the notes that they made.
[00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:18.600]   Not only-- not just the stuff they highlighted,
[00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:20.040]   but the stuff that they typed in themselves.
[00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:22.280]   So here's the way I underlined Photix Zone, which--
[00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:22.560]   Right.
[00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:24.080]   I mean, this is fantastic.
[00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:28.720]   I still have my high school calculus textbook
[00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:31.080]   and a couple of biology books that I refer to.
[00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:33.160]   I need to remember, OK, how do I do that?
[00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:35.080]   What's the algorithm for--
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:36.560]   a couple of my comp side books were, OK,
[00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:38.760]   what's the basic algorithm for doing this?
[00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:42.720]   And has not only-- because I paid $900 per title for it,
[00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:43.920]   I still have it on the shelf.
[00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:46.680]   And I also have my notes that I scribbled into it.
[00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:50.040]   And so I can imagine when people have to go back six, seven,
[00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:52.000]   eight, nine years later on, when they really
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.920]   do need to set up something to--
[00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:54.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:57.520]   Exactly, to remind themselves, oh, god.
[00:34:57.520 --> 00:34:58.760]   Now my kid is learning math.
[00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:00.440]   And I used to-- I know I used to learn this.
[00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:02.280]   Now I've got to go back and go back to--
[00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:03.840]   they can literally go back to the classroom
[00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:07.080]   they were in when they were 10 or 11 years old and reread
[00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:08.680]   their stuff, assuming that we still have iPads.
[00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:09.360]   Then.
[00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:11.400]   Well, yeah, I mean, that's always a problem
[00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:12.400]   with digital formats.
[00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:13.440]   Then there's other issues.
[00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:15.880]   I mean, one of the reasons textbooks publishers love this
[00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:17.440]   is because there's no resale.
[00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:20.400]   And there's a huge market when you buy $150 textbook,
[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:23.160]   reselling it for $80 is very, very important.
[00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:25.160]   That's gone.
[00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:26.880]   And so they make more money on it.
[00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:29.320]   But so the real question is, do we stay at $14.99?
[00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:30.680]   Adam, I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:33.200]   No, I just wanted to comment on the notes feature,
[00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:34.080]   which I think is great.
[00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:35.920]   And maybe this is a 1.0 thing.
[00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:38.160]   But one thing I immediately kind of noticed
[00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:40.760]   and wanted about that, wanted to have in that feature
[00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:44.760]   would be some sort of way of sharing those notes.
[00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:47.200]   And even better yet, it'd be awesome if students could
[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:51.000]   set up little virtual study groups where what I highlight
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.520]   and maybe make notes of are available to other friends who
[00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:56.200]   might follow me and vice versa.
[00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:58.440]   And we could almost have a threaded conversation
[00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:00.840]   around highlighted sections of the book.
[00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:02.400]   And maybe that's just a 1.0 thing.
[00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:03.480]   And it's something they have planned.
[00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:04.840]   But I'd love to see that out at dinner.
[00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:06.400]   Currently, you can't wait to work in the sales company.
[00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:09.400]   Email your notes, but you cannot send highlighted text.
[00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:13.440]   That, of course, is because it's copyright material.
[00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:15.680]   And so this is where copyright's getting away.
[00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:17.200]   And I think that's fair use.
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:18.200]   It's educational.
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:19.920]   It's not the whole book.
[00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:22.000]   But also, they could make it work just by--
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.760]   I said I've actually copied the text between users.
[00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:26.040]   Just simply, here is the marker.
[00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:27.600]   Start at this character and at that character.
[00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:29.440]   Then you'd have to have the book.
[00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:30.960]   Well, I hope that we'll go see the decision.
[00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:32.600]   And that might be the point is you'd have a study group.
[00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:35.640]   And I could set up a list of the friends in my class
[00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:38.800]   that I want to share information with.
[00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:41.080]   And it's just happening virtually inside the book.
[00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:43.600]   So I think that might get around some of those limitations.
[00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:45.760]   But it was just interesting to me that here's
[00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:48.720]   an opportunity that the technology brings forward that--
[00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:51.960]   seems like it was not implemented or not.
[00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:53.200]   They're probably thinking about it.
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:55.200]   And again, I have to keep coming back on it's 1.0.
[00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:56.800]   But I already want more.
[00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:57.600]   It's amazing to look at--
[00:36:57.600 --> 00:36:59.080]   So I stand corrected.
[00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:02.080]   This was just sent to me by our chat room.
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:05.160]   These are states that support the Common Core standard.
[00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:06.760]   In fact, California is now in that state.
[00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:09.040]   It's Texas that does not--
[00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:10.840]   looks like is that Virginia--
[00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:11.880]   Minnesota.
[00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:12.960]   Minnesota.
[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:13.840]   Nebraska.
[00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:16.680]   And-- well, you're good.
[00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:17.480]   That's not Minnesota.
[00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:18.800]   That's Michigan, isn't it?
[00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:19.280]   Wisconsin.
[00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:19.960]   No, Wisconsin.
[00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:21.360]   No, it's next to Wisconsin.
[00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:21.760]   What is that?
[00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:23.080]   What state is Minnesota?
[00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:24.320]   Minnesota.
[00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:28.920]   Anyway, so a few states haven't, which means, of course,
[00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:30.240]   it's still a little bit of a roadblock.
[00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:33.000]   But California has, for instance, most states have.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.400]   So that's good news.
[00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:34.920]   That's good news.
[00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:36.920]   So that Common Core-- thank you for the correction.
[00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:38.800]   That Common Core means that these
[00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:41.640]   would be legal and usable in many states.
[00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:44.320]   By the way, I made a book this morning.
[00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:46.200]   OK, well, that's-- OK, so--
[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:48.040]   so all right, that's authoring.
[00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:49.000]   So let's go to authoring.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.280]   So what they're doing with those textbooks--
[00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:51.520]   All I want to say about the textbooks
[00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:52.600]   is they're really boring right now.
[00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:54.040]   So the thing is they've added a little video,
[00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:55.800]   and they've added a little code, everything else.
[00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:59.040]   In their defense, you're trying to take a 300-page book.
[00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:02.000]   It's too much data to make it aggressive all through.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.160]   We don't know how much lead time they had.
[00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:05.360]   Oh, they've had years.
[00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:06.000]   Years.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:06.600]   Yeah, come on.
[00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:07.960]   Apple's been working on this for two or three years.
[00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:08.320]   Really?
[00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:08.720]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:13.080]   And the-- really, they went to E.O. Wilson two years ago
[00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:14.320]   and said, what would you like to do?
[00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:14.560]   Because if--
[00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:15.920]   No, no, they didn't say what we were going to like to do.
[00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:17.720]   Because they said, we're planning to bail.
[00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:20.520]   Apple told them we are planning to make our own books.
[00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:21.000]   Right.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:22.280]   This is in Steve Bierabseung.
[00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:23.320]   We're going to make our own books.
[00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:25.560]   We're going to sell the iPad and just give the books away.
[00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:27.600]   And if you don't want that to happen,
[00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:29.400]   you're going to make them interactive in here,
[00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:30.960]   and you're going to sell them for $14.99.
[00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:34.160]   And the moment they move those prices to $50, Apple's got $100
[00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:36.400]   billion that says, we will drive you into the ground.
[00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:36.840]   Oh, that's it.
[00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:38.040]   So you still stay at $14.
[00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:39.120]   Oh, I think they'll-- I don't think they're going
[00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:41.000]   to go very high, because I think Apple--
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.480]   behind them has-- we will build a curriculum on top of this.
[00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:45.280]   This is a major part of their direction.
[00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:46.920]   And if you step off the line, we're
[00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:49.120]   going to shove you into the water.
[00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:50.920]   You know, I don't--
[00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:54.000]   The other concern I have about these right now, Alex,
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:55.160]   you're pointing out, yeah, there's
[00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:56.400]   kind of limited interactivity.
[00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:58.080]   But they're huge, too.
[00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:00.800]   I think I downloaded the biology textbook from Pearson,
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:02.840]   and it's like two over two gigs.
[00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:03.400]   Yeah.
[00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:04.880]   And there's not a lot of interactivity.
[00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:05.560]   You have to have it.
[00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:06.480]   I'm kind of wondering.
[00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:08.360]   This is going to sell 64 gig iPads.
[00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:11.280]   $128 from the future of 256?
[00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:14.360]   Even the two-- even the two chapter EO Wilson book
[00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:15.880]   is huge, because of all the video in there.
[00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:17.840]   I mean, it's cool.
[00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:20.040]   I don't know if video used in this way.
[00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:20.360]   I don't know.
[00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:23.120]   Maybe it gets kids more engaged when they're--
[00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:24.120]   OK.
[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:25.920]   Mine's colder than theirs.
[00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:28.640]   We can stipulate that this is early days,
[00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:31.280]   and these are not the best possible examples.
[00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:33.000]   But the features are there.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:36.280]   So part two is this free authoring program.
[00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:38.720]   I'll let you say how great it is, because Alex has used it.
[00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:39.320]   He's already created--
[00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:39.960]   It's not perfect.
[00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:41.000]   --two books.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:41.720]   And it's not perfect.
[00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:44.480]   But then we'll talk about the larger ramifications
[00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:45.520]   of the license and so forth.
[00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:46.000]   So go ahead.
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:47.080]   Tell us how great this is.
[00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:49.400]   So I have a-- actually, before you do that,
[00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:51.520]   let's take a break.
[00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:52.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:52.840]   We got you.
[00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:53.640]   I'm sorry.
[00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:56.000]   No, because teases don't work in podcasts.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.920]   He's fast forward.
[00:39:57.920 --> 00:39:59.280]   Please don't.
[00:39:59.280 --> 00:39:59.960]   Please.
[00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:00.960]   I beg of you.
[00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:02.800]   Instead, open your browsers.
[00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:04.400]   Everybody follow along with teacher.
[00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:08.360]   And go to macbreak.hover.com.
[00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:09.680]   Everybody do it right now.
[00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:10.480]   Let's test the site.
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:10.960]   Site test?
[00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:12.720]   No, please.
[00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:14.160]   It always makes me really nervous.
[00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:15.000]   Site test.
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:15.880]   There you go.
[00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:16.440]   They can handle it.
[00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:17.800]   It makes me really nervous.
[00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:21.000]   Hover is domain name registration made simple.
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.800]   And I know we all are always going out saying, oh, I just
[00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:26.560]   thought of a great domain name and quick type it in.
[00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:31.120]   Hover is what I do from now on when I have domain names.
[00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:33.960]   It is fantastic because you don't have to click a bunch of
[00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:35.680]   links and buttons.
[00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:37.680]   And you miss one, and you just bought something you didn't
[00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:38.000]   want.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:39.160]   There's no upsell.
[00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:40.240]   It's very straightforward.
[00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:41.360]   They don't do hosting.
[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:42.600]   I want to make this clear.
[00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:46.360]   They are a domain registrar.
[00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:48.880]   You can use their email services.
[00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:49.880]   They can give you mailboxes.
[00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:51.000]   But they don't host websites.
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   That's not their point.
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.120]   The point of hover--
[00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:56.640]   excuse me, is to make me sneeze.
[00:40:56.640 --> 00:41:01.280]   No, the point of hover is inexpensive, effective domain
[00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:05.920]   name registration with great customer service.
[00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:08.560]   And by the way, that means they will not put you on hold.
[00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:11.360]   When you reach a customer service rep Monday through Friday,
[00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:13.920]   9 a.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern during their regular business hours,
[00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:15.120]   they will not put you on hold.
[00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:18.360]   They will solve your problem, help you with your transfer,
[00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:21.240]   whatever it is you need without putting on hold.
[00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:24.000]   They have a new feature called that they call premium
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.600]   domains and clucker trade-ins.
[00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:28.080]   What's a good-- let's see.
[00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:29.200]   What's your latest?
[00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:35.680]   OK, we want to do an iBooks store.
[00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:36.720]   Let's do iBooks store.
[00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:39.800]   Apple suggests iBooks store.com.
[00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:41.440]   I bet you that's not available.
[00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:44.120]   I never thought of that one.
[00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:45.560]   So it's going to search for the domain.
[00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:48.680]   Now, what will happen is there are people, by the way,
[00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:50.240]   Hover supports the open internet.
[00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:51.560]   Please stand with us and suppose,
[00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:54.360]   "Sopa, thank you, Hover. God bless you."
[00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:56.760]   So here's some domain names that they say,
[00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:58.440]   "Well, you could have this instead."
[00:41:58.440 --> 00:41:59.680]   iBooksstore.com is taken.
[00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:02.040]   I wonder who owns that.
[00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:05.000]   But iBooksstore.tell.org.us.
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:08.040]   And then there's some with like MiamiBooksstore.com.
[00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:10.320]   For some reason, that is a very valuable URL.
[00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:11.360]   Well, somebody owns it.
[00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:12.440]   Right.
[00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:14.440]   But what that person has said is they've told Hover,
[00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:18.240]   "Hey, if somebody wants it, we'll sell it for $1,749."
[00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:20.200]   Now, that sounds like a lot, but that's a great deal
[00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:21.880]   if you're a Miami Bookstore.
[00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:24.280]   Because if you go to them as a Miami Bookstore,
[00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:27.480]   often they'll say, "Yeah, I would sell it to you."
[00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:29.560]   So they've set the price ahead of time.
[00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:32.040]   These are what we call premium domains.
[00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:33.640]   You can upgrade to a premium domain.
[00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:36.200]   Trade in your old clunkers and Hover will refund
[00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:39.480]   every penny you've paid Hover for those clunker domains.
[00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:40.680]   Domains you never use.
[00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:43.640]   New York Bookstore.com. See, that's good.
[00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:45.080]   So these are all premium Seattle.
[00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:46.520]   See, somebody went out and registered
[00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:47.960]   all of these domain names.
[00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:51.640]   MysteryBookstores.com.
[00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:53.960]   But you can get them from them directly through Hover.
[00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:55.640]   So those are the premium domains.
[00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:59.080]   I love this idea of refunds on your domain names
[00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:00.280]   that you never use.
[00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:02.280]   And it doesn't say it in the ad copy,
[00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:03.800]   but I know Hover is still doing it.
[00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:06.120]   If you are going to transfer your domain names to Hover,
[00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:07.960]   they will do it all for you without--
[00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:10.760]   I wish I had done this because I got all my domains locked.
[00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:12.520]   They will do it all for you.
[00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:14.840]   Just call this number here, right on the front page,
[00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:16.760]   Macbreak.hover.com.
[00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:18.680]   And they will transfer your--
[00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:20.200]   their concierge service.
[00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:23.000]   I think normally they charge $25 for that.
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:24.920]   For as many domains as you want.
[00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:28.440]   Domain transfers $10 and you get an additional year
[00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:29.160]   on your domain.
[00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:30.680]   That's a good deal.
[00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:33.560]   And if you use Macbreak as the offer code,
[00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:38.040]   you'll get 10% off your non-premium domain.
[00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:39.400]   Hover is a great register.
[00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:40.920]   I just want you to keep it in the back of your mind.
[00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:43.960]   The next time you want to register a domain name,
[00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:47.320]   Macbreak.hover.com, we thank them for their support.
[00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:49.320]   They're kind of like the Mac of domain registrars code.
[00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:50.280]   They are simple.
[00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:51.480]   They're Apple-esque.
[00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:54.680]   Do one thing and do it well, kind of a thing.
[00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:57.400]   All right, so you've been using Author-- which--
[00:43:57.400 --> 00:44:01.400]   OK, Apple's taking a lot of heat over Author's ULA,
[00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:02.040]   but it's free.
[00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:04.360]   Is it a good tool?
[00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:06.200]   They said the Garage Band of textbooks.
[00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:08.760]   I think the reason people are upset about the ULA is they--
[00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:10.120]   They want to use it.
[00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:12.920]   I mean, a little bit of my background is--
[00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:13.560]   That's a good point.
[00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:15.000]   If it were crappy, nobody said--
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:15.880]   They'd be like, ah, whatever.
[00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:16.360]   Cheers.
[00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:18.280]   But well, not only did they want to use it,
[00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:20.040]   here's the problem for publishers.
[00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:22.600]   If you're a small publisher, you are not
[00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:25.000]   going to be able to make a book that competes with this on Apple
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.080]   or anywhere else without this tool,
[00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:30.760]   without spending an incredible amount of money on programmers.
[00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:33.000]   And every time you want to change the page or how it rolls over,
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:34.440]   you're not going to drag it like pages.
[00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:36.520]   You're going to have to write more code.
[00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:37.080]   And so the thing--
[00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:40.440]   Pages does, by the way, export ePub,
[00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:42.120]   which is the standard format.
[00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:43.720]   But here's the problem, though.
[00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:47.480]   This is going to change the way people make books.
[00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:50.760]   And my history-- I wrote a big, long thing in Google Plus
[00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:51.600]   about this.
[00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:54.720]   But someone-- I was looking at doing a manual for a company
[00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:55.680]   in the mid '90s.
[00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:58.400]   And I was like, we should just build the whole thing in director
[00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:00.320]   and make it interactive and make you click on it.
[00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:03.120]   I'm really glad they didn't take me up on that.
[00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:05.240]   But this is what-- literally, this is what I envisioned--
[00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:06.720]   Marvel.
[00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:09.960]   17 years ago was this is exactly what I wanted to do.
[00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:12.640]   And so what you can do is if you're
[00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:16.680]   already using keynote or pages, the interface looks the same.
[00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:17.720]   So you can drag things in.
[00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:18.920]   You move things around.
[00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:20.960]   You've got widgets that you might have seen.
[00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:23.400]   Widgets like what you would see in iWeb.
[00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:25.440]   And one of the interesting things
[00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:28.080]   is that you can import, for instance, 3D models.
[00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:29.920]   Also, you can import widgets, which
[00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:32.000]   allow you to inject dashcodes.
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.320]   So if you've written any dashcode for your little widgets
[00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:36.640]   that you would have on your dashboard,
[00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:38.920]   or if you know people that can do that, you can insert them.
[00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:39.800]   They don't all work.
[00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:41.600]   So one of the things I played around with a lot is if they
[00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:44.400]   ask for file access, they're not going to work.
[00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:46.480]   Some of them just don't work for no apparent reason.
[00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:48.200]   So they're not all working.
[00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:50.400]   This one that says I need to drink, it doesn't work.
[00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:52.480]   I was really excited about putting a cocktail.
[00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:53.480]   What was that going to be?
[00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:54.040]   Cocktail.
[00:45:54.040 --> 00:45:54.800]   It was going to be--
[00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:56.240]   Is it in the middle of your textbook?
[00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:57.640]   In the middle of your textbook, you feel like, oh,
[00:45:57.640 --> 00:45:58.800]   honey, martini.
[00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:01.280]   And you could just click a little button that would pop open.
[00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:03.120]   This is not for the K through 12.
[00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:04.040]   Oh, no.
[00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:06.880]   Well, and that's really important, too, is that this--
[00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:11.400]   I've already-- in the last two days,
[00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:14.680]   I think we've already booked almost half million
[00:46:14.680 --> 00:46:17.120]   dollars of production in this app.
[00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:18.200]   So what?
[00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:18.680]   Wait a minute.
[00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:19.160]   Wait a minute.
[00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:20.680]   Wait a minute.
[00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:22.880]   Wait a minute.
[00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:24.840]   Wait a minute.
[00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:27.680]   When I get excited, I can sell a lot of production.
[00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:28.280]   So--
[00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:29.080]   No kidding.
[00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:30.720]   So how about the wrong business?
[00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:32.120]   So you as in Pixelcore--
[00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:32.680]   Pixelcore.
[00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:34.480]   --have booked-- let me get this straight.
[00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:36.880]   In the last-- it came out Thursday.
[00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:38.520]   Monday, Tuesday.
[00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:40.200]   Have booked half a million dollars
[00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:43.120]   worth of people who want you to offer stuff for them.
[00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:45.560]   Now, I will say that I have been priming them for a year,
[00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:47.440]   knowing that eventually someone's going to build a tool that's
[00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:48.200]   going to let me do this.
[00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:49.200]   And so we've been building content--
[00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:51.360]   And what kinds of people are these are these corporations?
[00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:52.000]   They're big companies.
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:53.600]   Here's the deal is that-- is it training material?
[00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:54.560]   Yeah, it's training material.
[00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:56.720]   So the thing is is that this is--
[00:46:56.720 --> 00:46:57.480]   Oh my god.
[00:46:57.480 --> 00:46:58.640]   I'm thinking about textbooks.
[00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:00.760]   Oh, this is like-- and by the way, I'm not--
[00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:01.400]   I don't do the--
[00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:01.960]   This is actually probably--
[00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:03.000]   The devore act thing very much.
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:04.760]   But you really want to read my Google+.
[00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:06.920]   This is a better market for--
[00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:07.360]   Oh, no, no.
[00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:08.440]   The textbook market is tiny.
[00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:09.200]   It's not textbooks.
[00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:10.680]   It's business.
[00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:11.880]   So you want--
[00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:12.720]   Does they all have iPads?
[00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:13.800]   They can afford it.
[00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:15.440]   You want to build a great PR piece that you're
[00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:17.920]   going to send to all these press that you know have iPads.
[00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:19.760]   You can build an interactive--
[00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:20.560]   How do you get it to them?
[00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:21.080]   --a PDF.
[00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:21.520]   What?
[00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:22.320]   How do you get it to them?
[00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:23.400]   You can publish it for free.
[00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:23.840]   Doesn't matter.
[00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:24.240]   Publish it.
[00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:25.080]   Send them a link.
[00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:25.800]   Let them download it.
[00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:28.000]   Put it on Dropbox or Amazon S3 or--
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.480]   Yeah, I mean, you can-- oh, so it doesn't have to be on the store
[00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:31.360]   for me to get it.
[00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:32.560]   I don't think it has to be on the store.
[00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:33.600]   But you could, but why not?
[00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:34.400]   Put it on the store, right?
[00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:37.800]   You can export it to a file as a dot iBooks file.
[00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:39.040]   And then send it to them.
[00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:41.360]   So the thing is that when you're looking at what--
[00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:43.000]   so you look at the manual--
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:46.920]   the crazy manual that comes with your camera or your car
[00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:48.680]   forward when they pick up on this.
[00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:51.120]   They're going to have interactive manuals.
[00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:53.120]   And they're going to hire people like us to do it.
[00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:57.920]   So instead, when you buy a premium price car,
[00:47:57.920 --> 00:48:00.120]   you get an iPad instead of that big, thick manual.
[00:48:00.120 --> 00:48:01.080]   And it's got a train on it.
[00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:02.120]   Just to hell you can download it.
[00:48:02.120 --> 00:48:03.840]   If you bought the BMW, you probably have a car.
[00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:04.440]   Some cars had.
[00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:07.560]   So one car manufacturer is giving iPad manuals already.
[00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:10.560]   So-- and the-- but this is-- now they have a development
[00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:11.240]   tool to do that.
[00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:14.320]   On top of that, you buy your--
[00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:15.080]   there's the--
[00:48:15.080 --> 00:48:16.160]   Yeah, this is your post.
[00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:16.680]   It's my post.
[00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:18.000]   It's in Google Cops a couple of days.
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:22.840]   Yeah, Google-- plus, by the way, is my new blog.
[00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:24.000]   Anyone's wondering, I've given up.
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:27.640]   So anyway, the--
[00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:30.080]   Talk about embracing and golfing the vower.
[00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:32.920]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:35.840]   But the--
[00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:37.200]   AKEA.
[00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:38.720]   I'm waiting for someone who's going
[00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:40.520]   to have the conversation with aKEA
[00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:42.640]   so that I could build my shelves right the first time.
[00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:43.360]   Watch the video.
[00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:46.360]   So little videos and 3D animations and everything else
[00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:48.000]   that would all be possible within this.
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.080]   Just so I can get in on this half million dollar market.
[00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:51.920]   What do the skills are involved?
[00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:54.480]   Well, see, what's exciting for me is that you still
[00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:56.640]   need to have video skills and 3D skills.
[00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:58.400]   And we happen to develop all of those skills
[00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:00.080]   because in Pixelcore, that's what--
[00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:01.480]   So the Pixelcore has been designed
[00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:04.520]   to solve this problem for 12 years.
[00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:06.600]   So we're kind of launching the--
[00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:08.720]   there's a whole bunch of people all over the world
[00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:11.280]   that are getting pretty excited about it.
[00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:14.120]   But the-- so you still-- the thing
[00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:18.000]   is it's from a content developer's perspective.
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:21.080]   This is the biggest gold rush in the history of content
[00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:24.760]   development because every how to book-- 90% of borders
[00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:26.720]   when borders used to be there was nonfiction.
[00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:27.880]   It was about something.
[00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:30.640]   And all of those books were made obsolete last week.
[00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:32.480]   So the thing is, is they won't be-- people will still
[00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:33.280]   use them for a while.
[00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:37.720]   But as you start to-- like every Photoshop book, or 3D book,
[00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:42.120]   here's an example if we look at this overhead.
[00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:43.640]   So here's a-- can you switch it over?
[00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:44.800]   Did I blow your overhead?
[00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:46.000]   Well, I'll switch it over to me.
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:46.520]   But go ahead.
[00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:47.000]   I'll switch it over.
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:47.500]   Switch it over.
[00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:48.720]   You can do that.
[00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:49.480]   Take your time.
[00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:53.920]   So the thing is that it doesn't just change the reason
[00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:55.920]   that it's important that Apple owns this ecosystem
[00:49:55.920 --> 00:49:57.840]   and doesn't try to make it available for everybody,
[00:49:57.840 --> 00:50:00.480]   is that they're changing the way you build books.
[00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:03.240]   I don't want to do it the way everybody else has it done.
[00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:06.560]   I'm able to develop things that are way different.
[00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:09.000]   Like I started working on-- we're building all
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:09.600]   of our tutorials.
[00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:12.640]   So the stuff we're doing with the government of Rwanda,
[00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:14.320]   the school that we're building there, which launches
[00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:15.920]   in a couple of weeks.
[00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:17.160]   A year ago, we bid that we're going
[00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:18.640]   to do the whole curriculum on iPads.
[00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:21.960]   And I was getting really close to being really screwed.
[00:50:21.960 --> 00:50:25.600]   So if you look at this, this is just me just hacking stuff
[00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:26.960]   in just this-- I did this this morning just
[00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:27.960]   to kind of play around.
[00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:29.680]   So what's interesting about this one-- this
[00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:30.760]   is the drink one that doesn't work.
[00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:31.680]   So this is a book.
[00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:32.560]   This is a book.
[00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:37.840]   So anyway, so if I take this and I go, whoop, this is a--
[00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:39.640]   look at this.
[00:50:39.640 --> 00:50:40.400]   OK, this is a mixer.
[00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:45.320]   No, wait a minute.
[00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:47.920]   So these are third party widgets?
[00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:50.280]   No, this is the 3D widget that comes with the--
[00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:52.360]   So Apple's done some, but people are already doing this.
[00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:55.280]   Well, this widget here, so you can import any collata model.
[00:50:55.280 --> 00:50:58.920]   Collata is like as close to a standard in 3D as you can get.
[00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:04.640]   I download-- now, this is in the grand scheme of what's
[00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:06.320]   unfair.
[00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:07.480]   The collata model is free.
[00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:10.880]   It comes from Google's 3D warehouse, which is--
[00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:14.120]   so you can download almost everything from Google's 3D
[00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:14.480]   warehouse.
[00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:19.080]   Or you can model with Apple's free Google Sketchup
[00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:20.720]   and export it out as a collata model
[00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:23.880]   and then import it into your book.
[00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:27.240]   So anyway, so that's that there.
[00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:29.960]   If I pop that in, this movie for some reason-- this
[00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:31.040]   shows you the bugs, I think.
[00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:31.680]   Hold on.
[00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:33.000]   Yeah, that movie's not working.
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:35.560]   And I keep on breaking it in, I'm not sure why.
[00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:38.560]   Now, this is where things start to get interesting.
[00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:40.120]   So one of the things that we're looking at
[00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:42.280]   is how do we teach people how to do software,
[00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:43.800]   how to use software?
[00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:47.800]   And so what we're doing here is essentially you have--
[00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:49.800]   I first started doing the old tutorials
[00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:52.320]   that we had, a big screen with a little bit of text.
[00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:56.440]   And then I realized I can break this all up into each interface
[00:51:56.440 --> 00:51:57.760]   that you're going to go through in this step.
[00:51:57.760 --> 00:51:58.440]   I have images.
[00:51:58.440 --> 00:52:01.800]   Now, for an more advanced user, that might be all they need.
[00:52:01.800 --> 00:52:02.560]   Oh, I get it.
[00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:02.840]   I get it.
[00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:03.360]   I get it.
[00:52:03.360 --> 00:52:03.860]   I get it.
[00:52:03.860 --> 00:52:04.520]   And then they just go do it.
[00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:06.320]   And so that allows them to have kind of free access.
[00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:08.520]   But oh, if they don't understand it,
[00:52:08.520 --> 00:52:11.080]   I don't get what I'm supposed to do here.
[00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:12.800]   I can just pop into this.
[00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:14.640]   And now that's a video that actually
[00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:18.840]   shows you how to do that step that's in there.
[00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:22.400]   And then I can pop that back.
[00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:24.840]   So the videos are only there if you need them as a backup.
[00:52:24.840 --> 00:52:27.920]   But you then have all of these pieces that are here.
[00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:31.160]   And so the thing is that this is why you're not
[00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:33.200]   going to build this for other ePub formats.
[00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:35.800]   You're going to build this this way.
[00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:37.480]   Then this is the test.
[00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:40.360]   You can go, who is the president during the Civil War?
[00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:41.320]   I can check my answer.
[00:52:41.320 --> 00:52:43.120]   Yeah, was that keynote?
[00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:44.920]   No, this was actually--
[00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:46.000]   that's another widget that's already
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:48.360]   built into the iBook.
[00:52:48.360 --> 00:52:49.480]   You can just write these out.
[00:52:49.480 --> 00:52:51.120]   I don't know that they put keynote in there, too,
[00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:52.320]   but there's so much you could do with keynote.
[00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:53.760]   And there's a whole ecosystem.
[00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:54.680]   So here's keynote.
[00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:56.200]   And so what I did is I took these movies
[00:52:56.200 --> 00:52:58.000]   and I stacked them on top of each other in keynote.
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:52:59.400]   And then I exported it out to this.
[00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:01.120]   And so if I click on it here, that's
[00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:03.600]   a little quick time of a background plate that we had.
[00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:06.120]   And then if I just tap on it--
[00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:07.760]   if I just tap on it--
[00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:09.560]   this is the green screen shot that we shot.
[00:53:09.560 --> 00:53:12.000]   OK, because that's keynote tapping on it was next slide.
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:12.560]   Next slide.
[00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:15.640]   And if I tap on it again, there is the composite that--
[00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:16.440]   Holy cow.
[00:53:16.440 --> 00:53:19.760]   So the thing is is that-- and that was half an hour work
[00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:20.280]   this morning.
[00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:22.760]   You would normally put text that says tap
[00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:23.640]   to go to the next slide.
[00:53:23.640 --> 00:53:24.560]   You put all that stuff in.
[00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:27.320]   But the point is is that it was as a content creator,
[00:53:27.320 --> 00:53:29.480]   and especially someone who's been using keynote and all
[00:53:29.480 --> 00:53:31.400]   these other things, this was a piece of cake to throw together.
[00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:33.720]   Now I have to decide on design and all this other stuff
[00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:34.640]   we're playing around with it.
[00:53:34.640 --> 00:53:37.400]   But now we are focused on design.
[00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:40.960]   We're not being constrained by the structure, by the code,
[00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:42.920]   by the-- everybody else up until now that's
[00:53:42.920 --> 00:53:45.560]   been building interactive tools for the iPad
[00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:47.960]   have been writing crazy code.
[00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:49.920]   And the thing is is that now everyone's
[00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:50.960]   kind of unleashed with this.
[00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:54.120]   And I don't think that textbook market is particularly
[00:53:54.120 --> 00:53:54.720]   large market.
[00:53:54.720 --> 00:53:57.040]   What we're talking about is every corporation with a brain
[00:53:57.040 --> 00:53:59.840]   is going to be building the training materials on how
[00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:03.840]   to get started on your-- if you're selling anything,
[00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:06.400]   the number one way to increase value of your product
[00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:08.720]   is to make sure people are actually using it correctly.
[00:54:08.720 --> 00:54:11.120]   And so people, they buy a phone or they buy this,
[00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:11.800]   these cameras.
[00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:13.320]   Almost nobody knows how to do anything,
[00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:14.400]   but turn them on and hit play.
[00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:16.280]   Because the manuals are impenetrable.
[00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:16.880]   Exactly.
[00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:18.720]   So you start adding all this up, and you
[00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:20.960]   have a much more valuable camera instantly.
[00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:22.400]   And the thing is is that--
[00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:24.320]   Well, by the way, I'm going to go home and tell my kids
[00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:25.360]   to start learning author.
[00:54:25.360 --> 00:54:28.960]   Because it sounds like that's a job creation tool, right?
[00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:31.680]   Because now, content's hard.
[00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:33.040]   So there's really a lot of--
[00:54:33.040 --> 00:54:34.920]   There's still a lot of value for somebody who has existing
[00:54:34.920 --> 00:54:38.480]   content, and then they come to somebody like you--
[00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:39.600]   Of course, it has the ideas.
[00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:42.880]   I mean, it doesn't get rid of publishers completely.
[00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:45.360]   It does mean that if you've been only focused on text
[00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:48.000]   for a long time, you're going to have a harder turn.
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:50.680]   But if you are a publisher that's been thinking about it,
[00:54:50.680 --> 00:54:53.040]   that's been playing with it, and you still, as an author,
[00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:55.200]   may-- if you're really talented and you understand
[00:54:55.200 --> 00:54:59.120]   all these media pieces, and you understand design,
[00:54:59.120 --> 00:55:00.640]   and so on and so forth, you could definitely build
[00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:01.720]   your own book for 70%.
[00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:02.920]   But most likely, what's going to happen
[00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:06.200]   is you might end up splitting it with someone like us,
[00:55:06.200 --> 00:55:08.320]   who will split at 50/50 with you and what
[00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:10.960]   would get back from after Apple takes their 30 or whatever.
[00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:13.200]   That's still the best book deal.
[00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:14.280]   Andy might get better deals than me.
[00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:15.920]   But the best book deal that I've ever been offered
[00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:17.480]   is 18%.
[00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:18.680]   So that's unusual.
[00:55:18.680 --> 00:55:21.640]   That was me being really particular.
[00:55:21.640 --> 00:55:23.480]   And I couldn't do the book because I didn't want
[00:55:23.480 --> 00:55:24.680]   CD-ROM stuff in the back.
[00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:26.240]   I wanted it to be in the book.
[00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:27.480]   And I just kept on going up.
[00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:29.120]   I'm not going to do all this work if it's just
[00:55:29.120 --> 00:55:30.560]   going to end up in a book.
[00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:33.280]   And so this is a--
[00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:35.480]   but when you look at all this training material and everything
[00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:39.480]   else, being able to add all that together is stunning.
[00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:43.640]   And I think that the textbooks are great.
[00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:45.360]   But if you're looking at cookbooks,
[00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:47.880]   cookbooks will never be the same.
[00:55:47.880 --> 00:55:49.360]   I mean, you know, we'll actually be
[00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:52.440]   able to make those crazy meals.
[00:55:52.440 --> 00:55:53.680]   OK, Andy.
[00:55:53.680 --> 00:55:54.520]   Oh, what do you think?
[00:55:54.520 --> 00:55:56.480]   What do you think?
[00:55:56.480 --> 00:55:58.440]   I do think it's a real big deal.
[00:55:58.440 --> 00:56:00.240]   But I really--
[00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:03.000]   I could almost put money right now that when you see version
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:05.440]   1.5 of this or 2.0 of this, you're
[00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:08.200]   going to see this not just there to feed the textbooks
[00:56:08.200 --> 00:56:11.160]   door, but it's going to be there to feed the newsstand.
[00:56:11.160 --> 00:56:12.120]   Because you think about--
[00:56:12.120 --> 00:56:12.520]   Mags, yeah.
[00:56:12.520 --> 00:56:13.520]   --the source of--
[00:56:13.520 --> 00:56:16.640]   I mean, as they're describing all the things you need
[00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:19.000]   to make a great textbook, they're talking about, well,
[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:22.000]   lots and lots of text, but also lots and lots of pictures,
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:22.960]   lots and lots of media.
[00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:24.320]   It has to be dynamic.
[00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:26.200]   And you're kind of describing the problems
[00:56:26.200 --> 00:56:28.480]   that sports illustrated in the New Yorker and time
[00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:31.880]   and everybody else are having to create a workflow for converting
[00:56:31.880 --> 00:56:35.680]   these highly designed, really high media-driven newsstand
[00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:39.000]   publications to something that makes sense for the iPad.
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:44.280]   And it takes next to no effort to at least do a half-assed,
[00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:48.480]   really cool interactive media version of a magazine.
[00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:50.120]   And if you actually put effort on it--
[00:56:50.120 --> 00:56:51.760]   and if you not only put effort on it,
[00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:54.640]   but you train the person who is actually
[00:56:54.640 --> 00:56:57.480]   starts off with design skills as opposed to people who
[00:56:57.480 --> 00:57:01.200]   start off with developer skills, I think this really
[00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:05.320]   is the path to creating content like that, not necessarily
[00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:08.440]   for cheap, but with an outlay of money that really makes sense
[00:57:08.440 --> 00:57:11.320]   for the sort of publications they're putting together.
[00:57:11.320 --> 00:57:14.560]   I mean, it took me maybe two hours to do--
[00:57:14.560 --> 00:57:16.640]   it's been frustrating me that for the past two months,
[00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:19.400]   I've been trying to figure out how do you do an ePub that
[00:57:19.400 --> 00:57:23.160]   has even just a grain of style about it.
[00:57:23.160 --> 00:57:27.000]   It isn't just simple, OK, I guess it's going to be palatino.
[00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:30.320]   I guess I was able to paste a photo between this paragraph
[00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:31.320]   and this paragraph.
[00:57:31.320 --> 00:57:33.680]   How do you actually do something that has a little bit of style
[00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:37.520]   and sort of puts its head above the water of design a little bit?
[00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:41.520]   And anybody with an hour and a half's worth of effort
[00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:45.000]   can take a manuscript and turn to something pretty cool.
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:48.320]   And really, all you need to do-- yes, yes, a little bit earlier,
[00:57:48.320 --> 00:57:50.560]   like what do you need to know to get in here?
[00:57:50.560 --> 00:57:52.320]   And if you're using pages right now,
[00:57:52.320 --> 00:57:53.920]   and if you're using keynote right now,
[00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:56.840]   you really do know 80% to 85% of everything
[00:57:56.840 --> 00:57:58.840]   you would ever need to know about using this product.
[00:57:58.840 --> 00:58:01.240]   It really is a mashup between those two apps.
[00:58:01.240 --> 00:58:02.160]   How about InDesign?
[00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:04.560]   Because that's what book publishers use and magazines
[00:58:04.560 --> 00:58:04.880]   use.
[00:58:04.880 --> 00:58:08.520]   Is this comparable in capability and quality to InDesign?
[00:58:08.520 --> 00:58:09.520]   No.
[00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:11.840]   It's just that they're two totally different products.
[00:58:11.840 --> 00:58:16.800]   This version 1.0 of this app is really key towards doing textbooks.
[00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:19.240]   If you try to do a short story with it,
[00:58:19.240 --> 00:58:22.240]   if you try to do something that's not really heavy media,
[00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:25.400]   not really heavy in organization, meaning something that's not
[00:58:25.400 --> 00:58:27.920]   built off of an outline where it's chapter 1,
[00:58:27.920 --> 00:58:32.400]   and then a chapter 1 is section 1.1, 22.3, 0.4, 0.5,
[00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:33.840]   you're going to find a kind of rough sledding.
[00:58:33.840 --> 00:58:37.160]   You'll have to really adapt what you have to fit into the sort
[00:58:37.160 --> 00:58:41.120]   of product that the iBooks Author app is designed to do.
[00:58:41.120 --> 00:58:43.320]   So the other thing that's missing
[00:58:43.320 --> 00:58:47.480]   is that it's really one person, one desktop, one app,
[00:58:47.480 --> 00:58:49.680]   style of design tool.
[00:58:49.680 --> 00:58:51.720]   It's not very collaborative at all.
[00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:53.640]   It's not scriptable at all.
[00:58:53.640 --> 00:58:57.840]   So if you've got a publication that's got multiple authors,
[00:58:57.840 --> 00:59:01.160]   it really has to have an organization chart where
[00:59:01.160 --> 00:59:03.200]   there's one designer, that one developer
[00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:04.920]   at the top of the pyramid whose job
[00:59:04.920 --> 00:59:07.720]   it is to take all of this content and manually slap it
[00:59:07.720 --> 00:59:11.200]   into whatever template you're building.
[00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:13.600]   Adam, your thoughts.
[00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:16.400]   And then I'll get into the license issue.
[00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:18.880]   Well, I think it's really, really amazing.
[00:59:18.880 --> 00:59:21.160]   And I think of-- it's going to be-- it's
[00:59:21.160 --> 00:59:23.800]   like a lot of things that Apple does,
[00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:26.600]   where once it gets in the hands of the people,
[00:59:26.600 --> 00:59:28.520]   it made the tool available now.
[00:59:28.520 --> 00:59:31.240]   And you see Alex doing one thing with it.
[00:59:31.240 --> 00:59:34.440]   I see this being huge for maybe teachers
[00:59:34.440 --> 00:59:38.200]   who want to build lesson plans that they can give to the students.
[00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:41.160]   But it can really-- they can now demonstrate through a little
[00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:44.040]   video what the project is or add in additional elements.
[00:59:44.040 --> 00:59:48.840]   I also see potential for schools to build up a library,
[00:59:48.840 --> 00:59:52.560]   I think, of reports that I did in school, grade school,
[00:59:52.560 --> 00:59:54.400]   high school, college.
[00:59:54.400 --> 00:59:57.360]   If those could be published and put into a school library
[00:59:57.360 --> 01:00:00.400]   that then other students could download and get that content.
[01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:03.040]   You can self-publish your own books within even just
[01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:04.040]   one institution.
[01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:06.440]   And there's going to be amazing stories like that
[01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:09.040]   where we're going to see people now take this tool
[01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:13.640]   and take it beyond even what Apple originally intended it for.
[01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:14.760]   And it's going to be another one.
[01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:16.680]   These technologies that's going to really evolve.
[01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:19.960]   How easy is it to do third-party plugins for this?
[01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:21.000]   Is it easy?
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.120]   It's a dashboard widget.
[01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:23.480]   It's an HTML dashboard.
[01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:24.640]   I don't understand what it's.
[01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:27.120]   It's a dashboard like Apple dashboard widgets.
[01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:31.000]   That's it is, JavaScript, HTML5.
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:31.960]   It is.
[01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:34.480]   So if you have a dashboard, existing dashboard widget--
[01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:35.720]   It's not all of them work.
[01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:36.720]   There's certain rules.
[01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:37.920]   There's a sandbox.
[01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:41.200]   So you can't do things that are asking for files on the desk
[01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:42.000]   within the computer.
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.320]   And there are certain things that it won't do.
[01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:46.080]   But outside of that, if you did those,
[01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:47.080]   you'll know how to build these.
[01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:49.320]   And the thing is that's what's going to set developers really
[01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:49.720]   apart.
[01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:51.400]   You're going to be able to do a lot of interaction
[01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:53.240]   and a lot of great stuff with keynote.
[01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:55.760]   And the high-end ones that we see coming out
[01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:58.760]   will be ones where you start bringing in some developers doing,
[01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:02.520]   but web developers, not heavy-duty developers that
[01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:04.360]   are putting stuff together, and only for a little bits
[01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:07.600]   of what you're adding to add some kind of example to it.
[01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:10.840]   I think you're going to see a whole group of developers pop up
[01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:13.720]   that are building widgets for other designers and people
[01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:16.280]   to use in their books and just making them available
[01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:17.200]   and selling those.
[01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:18.080]   There's another business.
[01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:21.880]   So we've identified now two really good businesses.
[01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:24.360]   Now, there's the problem.
[01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:27.440]   The license says you can do this and give it away.
[01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:29.200]   But if you want to-- hello.
[01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:32.160]   If you want to-- wow.
[01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:36.800]   If you want to sell it, you have to go through Apple's bookstore.
[01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:39.360]   You may not sell it anywhere else.
[01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:41.440]   And they're going to take a lot of heat for this.
[01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:42.480]   I'm not sure I agree.
[01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:44.040]   You have a book that only works on the iPad,
[01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:46.240]   and you can only sell it through there.
[01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:47.840]   Like it only works on the iPad.
[01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:49.840]   Where else are you going to sell it?
[01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:52.880]   Well, but you could get an ecelerate.com storefront
[01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:54.520]   and just sell the file directly.
[01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:56.560]   But it's given that you're paying
[01:01:56.560 --> 01:01:59.200]   zilch for this really complicated design tool.
[01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:01.000]   I think it's just kind of a clear tool.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.920]   I think that there is a lot of initial outrage
[01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:07.560]   because the wording wasn't so specific as to discount
[01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:11.200]   the conclusion that if I were to publish a novel that I
[01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:13.280]   wrote two years ago through this app,
[01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:15.560]   that means that I can't create an ePub version of it
[01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:18.560]   that I can sell through other stores or Kindle
[01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:19.880]   versus that consult with Kindle Store.
[01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:21.560]   That appears not to be the case.
[01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:24.400]   They're just talking about the actual piece of software
[01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:27.600]   built by this app, not the content itself.
[01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:29.040]   And I think that the fact that if you want to,
[01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:31.000]   for instance, I was immediately thought,
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.080]   oh, it would be great.
[01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:34.520]   We were always going to do a documentary about the making
[01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:37.920]   in the studio to make that be maybe an iBook instead
[01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:41.160]   with video, but plus text, plus graphics, and so forth.
[01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:44.600]   And if I give that away, I could do anything I want with it.
[01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:47.040]   And I don't think that it would break the EULA
[01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:49.760]   for you to add advertising into the book that you gave away.
[01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:52.080]   - No, somebody should read the EULA carefully on that.
[01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:53.960]   - No, I don't think, I don't, you know,
[01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:55.560]   you're not selling it.
[01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:59.680]   - The other kind of poison pill when the EULA is that
[01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:01.600]   it's like any other thing that you want to sell
[01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:03.720]   through the iBook Store, through the iTunes Store,
[01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:05.560]   it's subject to Apple's approval.
[01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:07.760]   So it's possible you could spend two or three months
[01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:09.840]   creating a textbook or creating something you want to sell
[01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:11.280]   through the iBook Store, but then Apple says,
[01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:13.040]   you know what, I think we have enough books
[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:14.120]   about the Civil War.
[01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:15.240]   - Oh, that's your book. - Nice as your book is,
[01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:16.880]   but we're not gonna let you sell it through the store.
[01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:19.280]   - So, and Webby in the chatroom is pointing out
[01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:21.920]   the problem, Apple becomes the gateway now
[01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:24.840]   for educational materials, news.
[01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:26.600]   Suddenly, instead of just for apps,
[01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:29.280]   they're a gateway for content.
[01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:32.040]   - And the only way for this to change is for Google
[01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:34.000]   and or Amazon to step up and build an app
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:35.640]   that is as good as this one that will produce
[01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:36.480]   an open format.
[01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:38.640]   - Here's the thing, that's the complaint that I hear,
[01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:40.520]   and I think this is the one I would agree with.
[01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:43.880]   There is an EPUB3 standard, and Apple has extended it.
[01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:45.760]   Now, admittedly, they had to to give it all these
[01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:48.680]   features, but they've extended it, and by doing so,
[01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:50.240]   cut the legs out from under it.
[01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:53.840]   So, but as a developer, I guess, as someone who's developing
[01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:56.480]   the tools, I don't want them to extend, I don't want vanilla.
[01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:58.920]   What I want is the most interactivity.
[01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:02.040]   - I'll get it in our sphere, they did it with podcasts.
[01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:06.080]   They added iTunes extensions that if you're a podcaster,
[01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:07.720]   you really have to support.
[01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:10.320]   Now, it didn't wasn't onerous 'cause they didn't say,
[01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:13.240]   and I'm thank God they didn't say, oh, and by the way,
[01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:15.400]   here's a tool, and if you use it, you have to publish it
[01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:16.520]   on Apple and nowhere else.
[01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:17.960]   Thank God they didn't do that.
[01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:20.120]   But to me, it's analogous.
[01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:22.400]   They're extending a standard, making it better.
[01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:24.040]   This is the honeypot.
[01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:25.520]   I'm not saying they're not making it better.
[01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:28.200]   - And by not being inside of a standard,
[01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:29.680]   it means they can continue to develop
[01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:30.720]   and continue to move it forward,
[01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:32.560]   and they don't have to ask anybody for any permission.
[01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:33.920]   - It's the Apple way, I understand.
[01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:37.000]   - But I mean, as a developer, I want to have the best.
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:38.960]   I want it to be the best that an iPad can handle.
[01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:40.920]   There's gonna be 100 million iPads in the system
[01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:41.760]   by the end of the year.
[01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:45.440]   - What if next year, half the tablets out there are Android?
[01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:46.280]   - I don't care.
[01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:47.520]   - There's 100 million.
[01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:49.400]   - There's 100, no, no, but here's the thing.
[01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:51.160]   Here's the problem with that argument is,
[01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:55.120]   is by the end of next year, there is 100 million iPads
[01:04:55.120 --> 01:04:55.960]   in the system.
[01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:57.040]   That's the projection right now.
[01:04:57.040 --> 01:04:57.880]   - So they're sufficient.
[01:04:57.880 --> 01:05:00.200]   - Who cares if that's half of the market?
[01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:01.880]   - And you say the onus, and I think you're right,
[01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:05.640]   is on Amazon and Google to respond by making a,
[01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:06.640]   they won't, 'cause they can't,
[01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:09.320]   but making a similarly effective tool for a standard.
[01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:12.920]   - I find it just absurd to say that Apple somehow
[01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:14.880]   being evil by creating something that is free
[01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:15.720]   for their own system.
[01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:19.000]   And if they don't, if people don't like it, don't use it.
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:20.840]   - Well, it's also stupid.
[01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:21.880]   Sorry, Adam, go ahead.
[01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:24.000]   - No, sorry, I was just gonna say the other thing
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.720]   that people are missing out on too, or not mentioning,
[01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:30.320]   which is just odd to me, is that Apple has pages out there,
[01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:33.120]   which does support the EPUB2 standard, I believe,
[01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:34.120]   in terms of its exports.
[01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:34.960]   - That's right.
[01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:36.760]   - And you fully expect Apple to update that for EPUB3.
[01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:39.680]   So, hey, here's a tool you can, Apple tool you can use
[01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:42.760]   to develop your EPUB book and sell it wherever you want.
[01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:45.160]   - Yeah, also there's the practical consideration.
[01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:47.160]   I mean, think about how difficult it is just to create
[01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:49.960]   an EPUB2 that will render the exact same way
[01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:51.680]   on every single reader device.
[01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:53.600]   Think about how difficult it is to create a webpage
[01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:57.240]   that if everyone who has to monkey with CSS knows that,
[01:05:57.240 --> 01:06:00.720]   now I've got to put it here's a CSS code
[01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:02.280]   for having a rounded rectangle.
[01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:04.440]   And here's the exception for this browser.
[01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:06.280]   And here's an exception for this browser.
[01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:09.440]   And here's an exception for this edition of this browser.
[01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:11.880]   And for Apple to, the reason why this app can work
[01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:14.160]   is that they do control every single iPad.
[01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:17.200]   So they know exactly, they can promise that the developer
[01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:19.440]   that when you develop a book with iBooks Author,
[01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:22.320]   it will look exactly this way on every single iPad.
[01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:25.160]   I can't imagine how incredibly complex this app
[01:06:25.160 --> 01:06:27.720]   would have to get in order to predict the same thing
[01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:30.400]   for every other tablet device that uses EPUB3.
[01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:33.480]   - And as this article points out from October,
[01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:35.280]   Amazon did the same thing.
[01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:38.400]   - No, they don't support EPUB3 really
[01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:40.440]   in their Kindle from Obi format.
[01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:42.560]   - So everybody, I mean, it makes sense.
[01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:44.720]   These are private companies, they're gonna act
[01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:45.920]   in their own interest.
[01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:47.080]   I don't expect them to support business.
[01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:48.760]   - I don't see why, the amount of,
[01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:50.840]   it would literally triple or quadruple the engineering
[01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:53.040]   for Apple to build something that would do this level
[01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:55.480]   of work and then it would only work for a couple of months
[01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:58.240]   before the standard, you know, would be vanilla.
[01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:00.080]   And why would they go through all of that
[01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:01.800]   just to support somebody else's business model?
[01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:03.480]   That doesn't, it just doesn't make any sense.
[01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:04.560]   You know, it doesn't make any sense
[01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:06.440]   from the go through the extra effort to do that
[01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:09.120]   when they could, you know, build this and again--
[01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:11.640]   - And if Apple said, "Hey, you know,
[01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:14.960]   "your web browser, HTML5 is a nice standard,
[01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:16.880]   "but we could make a better web browser
[01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:17.880]   "that would make sites better,
[01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:19.720]   "more interesting, more interactive."
[01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:21.760]   And all you have to do is make your website
[01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:23.680]   work with our browser.
[01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:24.680]   - Then he is what everybody does.
[01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:28.320]   - And you have to, no, but there is an attempt, admittedly,
[01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:31.280]   but there is an attempt to support a standard
[01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:33.360]   because you want an open web.
[01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:35.160]   - Well, it's all about where you are.
[01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:37.120]   - You kinda doing that because they already have
[01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:40.080]   their own extensions to webkit that are specific to Safari.
[01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:42.920]   At the very minimum, they take standards
[01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:44.160]   that aren't really ratified yet
[01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:47.760]   and make them available to Safari before,
[01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:49.240]   and support them first before anybody else.
[01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:50.520]   It's like the drop shadow effects,
[01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:53.560]   things like text effects that weren't quite ready yet.
[01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:55.400]   And there, you can always tell the difference
[01:07:55.400 --> 01:07:58.920]   between the website of a really good Mac developer
[01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:02.000]   versus anybody else because they're using all kinds of cocoa.
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.160]   They're using all kinds of really cool tricks
[01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:06.600]   that are specific to Safari to make their site
[01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:09.600]   look just eight leagues better than anything else out there.
[01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:11.880]   But the bottom line is that if Apple is free to do that
[01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:13.840]   because they're the ones who are gonna be hit
[01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:16.240]   and taken the fall, if they create an incompatible system
[01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:19.160]   that nobody supports, they've just thrown a whole bunch
[01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:21.120]   of millions of dollars in training
[01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:22.880]   into their own toilet system
[01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:24.160]   and they're gonna lose all that money.
[01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:25.160]   - Well, but the sneaky thing--
[01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:29.000]   - They reap the rewards, they take the losses
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.240]   so they can take that sort of risk.
[01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:31.720]   - The sneaky thing to do though is to,
[01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:33.620]   and you could do this with the web,
[01:08:33.620 --> 01:08:35.000]   is to make something that's much better
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.240]   than the existing standards.
[01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:39.800]   'Cause standards admittedly slow, political, committee,
[01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:41.800]   so you could do the same thing with the web.
[01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:43.800]   Let's just, this is a thought experiment.
[01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:46.160]   Make a browser that supported pages
[01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:48.240]   that were fantastically better.
[01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:49.360]   Thank you for thinking.
[01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:51.560]   Fantastically better and say,
[01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:54.440]   "Hey, just use our browser and the world works better."
[01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:57.320]   In effect, this is what they've done for textbooks.
[01:08:57.320 --> 01:09:00.280]   That would undermine, now admittedly the market
[01:09:00.280 --> 01:09:01.840]   would rule, et cetera, et cetera,
[01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:05.520]   but that would undermine the idea of a free and open web.
[01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:07.360]   Is this not undermining the idea
[01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:08.600]   of a free and open information,
[01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:09.800]   interchange via textbooks?
[01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:12.240]   - I guess I want performance.
[01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:13.240]   Like I want it to be the best.
[01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:14.880]   - Yeah, that's why the honey pot works.
[01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:15.720]   - You know, if you wanna, you know--
[01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:17.560]   - That's why it works 'cause it's better.
[01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:19.360]   - And so the thing is, is that I,
[01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:21.000]   and I have to admit that I'm impatient.
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:24.240]   I hate school, I wanted school to be more interactive,
[01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:26.760]   more fun, more, I was fascinated by all of the stuff.
[01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:29.040]   And so I want school to be great for kids.
[01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:30.800]   I don't really care whose platform it's on,
[01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:31.640]   to be honest with you.
[01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:33.560]   'Cause I, you know, going to school for me
[01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:35.760]   was like being dragged through hell.
[01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:37.680]   So, you know, of these stupid books
[01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:39.600]   with these stupid everything else.
[01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:40.760]   And so the, so anyway--
[01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:42.360]   - Well, could you make it better
[01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:43.200]   and still keep it open?
[01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:44.560]   - No, I guess that's your position.
[01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:45.920]   - It's just, I'm just saying it's too slow.
[01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:47.720]   - And as a person who's gotta develop these books,
[01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:48.640]   I don't wanna support them all.
[01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:51.120]   I just want the largest single marker
[01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:52.200]   that I can publish to.
[01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:53.760]   You know, and the thing is, is that,
[01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:56.680]   and I do, and if Google or Amazon came out with something,
[01:09:56.680 --> 01:09:57.920]   I'd be very interested.
[01:09:57.920 --> 01:09:59.560]   You know, and I do hope that Google,
[01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:01.440]   I think it's important for Google to do this, by the way.
[01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:02.560]   I think that they could build something
[01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:04.400]   that would make it easier to develop.
[01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:05.240]   I think what they've done with,
[01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:06.960]   I'm a, you know, as I said, I moved to Google Plus.
[01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:09.000]   I'm a big Google fan.
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.160]   And I think that, and I'm hoping to see them do something
[01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:13.080]   that makes it easier to develop across these formats.
[01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:15.960]   But Apple shouldn't dumb themselves down
[01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:17.960]   just because everyone else is dragging through the mud.
[01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:20.880]   - I think this is a very fundamental argument
[01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:23.320]   in general in technology.
[01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:27.160]   And you're right, lowest standard
[01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:29.320]   is somewhat of a lowest common denominator.
[01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:31.520]   It has to serve a variety of platforms.
[01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:34.080]   But that reason we have standards
[01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:37.520]   is so that no one company can dominate
[01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:40.480]   what is so vital to a democracy,
[01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:41.400]   so it's vital to the world,
[01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:44.080]   which is the free and open interchange of information.
[01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:47.000]   If one company dominates that, it's an Apple world.
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:48.520]   And what Apple is doing is what,
[01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:50.480]   as what Apple would have loved to do with the web,
[01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:51.400]   and I don't know why they didn't,
[01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:54.320]   maybe they still will, which is to say, well, but we're good.
[01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:57.880]   And look, a textbook admittedly isn't the best format,
[01:10:57.880 --> 01:10:59.280]   but it's universal.
[01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:00.200]   It works everywhere.
[01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:01.760]   You don't even need electricity.
[01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:05.400]   It is a standard that everybody can read, paper, ink,
[01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:06.600]   everybody can read it.
[01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:10.400]   You're now creating a standard for people who own iPads.
[01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:15.080]   It is, I think, it is a very, very negative thing
[01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:16.520]   to do to the world.
[01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:19.640]   It is a way of saying, hey, we can make it better.
[01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:22.640]   All you need is to own one of our fancy devices.
[01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:24.600]   And you'll have a much better experience.
[01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:26.400]   You'll have a better access to information,
[01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:27.640]   better access to education.
[01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:31.520]   And I would call on textbook companies, publishers,
[01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:32.800]   to turn their back on that.
[01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:35.080]   I don't care if Ford or Salesforce
[01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:37.360]   wants to do the training manuals, that's different.
[01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:39.440]   But I would call on companies that are responsible
[01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:42.000]   for the dissemination of information
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.440]   to make the world a better place,
[01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:46.960]   to turn their back on proprietary extensions.
[01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:48.680]   They're very sexy.
[01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:50.080]   They're very appealing.
[01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:51.800]   And that's exactly the problem,
[01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:55.280]   because what it means is the world has to own an iPad.
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:57.880]   And that's exactly what's wrong with this whole thing.
[01:11:57.880 --> 01:12:00.000]   I think the challenge for them will be that,
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:01.000]   if they turn their back--
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:01.600]   It's greedy.
[01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:02.680]   No, no.
[01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:04.440]   My prediction is they turn their back,
[01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:06.840]   and Apple will spend $20 billion
[01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:11.080]   on building a free textbook system
[01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:13.000]   that just comes with your iPad.
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.120]   And I think that was in the book,
[01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:16.960]   that's what Steve's original vision was.
[01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:18.520]   I'm not going to deal with any of these guys.
[01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:19.520]   I'm just going to build my own.
[01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:20.520]   And Apple has the money to do it.
[01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:22.400]   I'd give a crap if Apple wants to develop apps
[01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:23.160]   for their iPad.
[01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:25.360]   That's a business model.
[01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:28.360]   We're now talking about something that is very important,
[01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:30.800]   which is textbooks, which is education,
[01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:33.000]   which needs to be open and accessible to the world.
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.200]   I don't see Apple making any--
[01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:38.560]   One of the things that was missing at this announcement was,
[01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:40.840]   and we're going to make sure that every student in America
[01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:41.640]   has an iPad.
[01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:44.800]   I don't see anything like that.
[01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:45.320]   Yeah.
[01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:46.320]   And that's a good point.
[01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:48.080]   That's a good question.
[01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:49.760]   That's a good point.
[01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:51.960]   But I'm sorry, Adam, you said that they did
[01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:53.000]   or addressed that point?
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:54.040]   I said they did not.
[01:12:54.040 --> 01:12:54.560]   They did not.
[01:12:54.560 --> 01:12:54.760]   Sorry.
[01:12:54.760 --> 01:12:55.200]   They did not.
[01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:55.400]   OK.
[01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:56.160]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:59.000]   I didn't hear anything like that either.
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:12:59.880]   That's a good point.
[01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:02.480]   But can we spend the next hour talking
[01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:05.600]   about all the different barriers to education
[01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:07.880]   that every single implementation, of course,
[01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:09.040]   where has.
[01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:11.000]   There are school systems in which they
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:14.240]   are issuing Windows laptops because it's a more open idea
[01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:17.440]   than simply having to force to one vendor for educational
[01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:17.720]   hardware.
[01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:19.920]   But it does lock people into Windows and also Windows
[01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:20.600]   support.
[01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:23.480]   How about the language problems where school systems
[01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:26.080]   have X percentage of kids in every district who
[01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:29.720]   can't really aren't really natural English speakers.
[01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:32.040]   They're working on extra curriculum to address that.
[01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:34.680]   But they're not learning math quite correctly.
[01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:36.400]   They're not learning other stuff that's quite correctly
[01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:38.360]   because they're not learning their original language.
[01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:40.120]   Well, does this solve those problems?
[01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:42.520]   That can't afford to keep updating their textbooks
[01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:44.120]   because they're so expensive.
[01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:45.440]   Yes, there are other problems.
[01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:46.720]   Let's not add new problems.
[01:13:46.720 --> 01:13:47.880]   The iPad has problems.
[01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:49.600]   But welcome to the world.
[01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:52.000]   That's going to be a problem here everywhere.
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:55.600]   I'm glad that if there are school systems that
[01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:58.240]   have looked at this entire proposal from start to finish,
[01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:00.120]   looked at the economics of it from start to finish,
[01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:01.840]   and also looked at the needs of their students
[01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:06.080]   and their teachers, and decided that iPad courseware,
[01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:09.160]   a combination of textbooks that they're buying from publishers,
[01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:11.200]   and also encouraging and training their teachers
[01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:13.920]   to create fine-tuned courseware specifically
[01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:16.360]   for the classes of their teaching, if that makes sense to them,
[01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:19.160]   I'm glad there is this now this new rational option
[01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:20.000]   available to them.
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:21.320]   I can't be angry about this.
[01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:25.360]   And I do not believe that in the next 10 years,
[01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:27.800]   every school system has to realize they're going to have
[01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:29.200]   to find the money, the federal government's going to have
[01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:31.040]   to find the money, the states are going to have to find the money.
[01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:33.160]   Your students in the United States will not be able to keep up
[01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:36.160]   with the rest of the world if they do not have access.
[01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:38.240]   No, no, no, access to a computer.
[01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:41.240]   So the thing is, is that that's a good argument for open source.
[01:14:41.240 --> 01:14:44.800]   But what I'll say is that they're going to drop $500
[01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:46.000]   per student somewhere.
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:47.640]   And the question is, is where they're going to do that?
[01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:48.880]   Let's have them buy iPad.
[01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:51.520]   Well, I mean, I'm just saying, I don't know whether it's iPads
[01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:52.600]   or HPs or whatever.
[01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:54.880]   The thing is, is that that is not a cost that is not--
[01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:57.120]   that the cost that's going to have to go across those school
[01:14:57.120 --> 01:14:59.320]   systems no matter what, obviously, Apple's making a play
[01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:01.520]   for that they have a good--
[01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:04.600]   By destroying what is essentially a much more open
[01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:08.600]   and free-flowing system, by making something so much better.
[01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:09.520]   I would presume--
[01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:11.240]   I just textbook companies.
[01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:13.720]   I just-- I'm so communist.
[01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:16.680]   No, that's exactly how all standards work.
[01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:19.720]   You can always make something better that is not--
[01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:20.800]   that is proprietary.
[01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:21.160]   So--
[01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:23.880]   And that's why there is--
[01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:24.720]   I hate the web.
[01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:26.040]   And it's the bottom one.
[01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:28.960]   It's unfair to the greasy spoon diner across the street
[01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:31.280]   that gives everybody the trots who eats there.
[01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:32.400]   They're being pushed out of business
[01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:34.520]   by a really good, clean, delicious diner
[01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:36.640]   across the street that does a much, much better job
[01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:38.960]   and serves a much, much better product.
[01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:41.960]   I mean, it's the presence of Apple in this market is--
[01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:44.520]   if someone feels that strongly about open source software,
[01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:48.680]   great, come up with something that's 80% as good as this tool.
[01:15:48.680 --> 01:15:51.760]   That is this easy to use, that's this reliable
[01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:53.760]   and produces this kind of results.
[01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:54.440]   That's great.
[01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:57.320]   I mean, I'm not an Apple fan that I like
[01:15:57.320 --> 01:15:59.200]   to see them make more money than anybody else
[01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:00.200]   and grab a market.
[01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:03.800]   But again, I don't like to see arguments that
[01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:07.920]   are dogmatic in nature just because something
[01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:10.160]   is ideologically unsound.
[01:16:10.160 --> 01:16:11.960]   That doesn't mean that it shouldn't be on the market.
[01:16:11.960 --> 01:16:14.960]   And if it is just another store, like it's OK, well,
[01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:16.320]   you have a choice.
[01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:18.480]   You could have this textbook or this textbook.
[01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:20.480]   You could buy an iPad or not.
[01:16:20.480 --> 01:16:21.400]   Then you're right.
[01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:23.280]   I don't have a problem with it.
[01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:26.600]   What I would have a problem is if it ends up
[01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:30.320]   cutting the legs out from under a standard that
[01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:36.080]   has the potential to run on an OLPC or an any computer.
[01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:37.640]   There's an enormous number of companies
[01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:39.080]   that have an enormous amount of money
[01:16:39.080 --> 01:16:41.480]   that if they decide to, they could build a development tool.
[01:16:41.480 --> 01:16:43.160]   That's what that would compete with this.
[01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:45.080]   And if they don't have the vision to do this,
[01:16:45.080 --> 01:16:47.400]   and they get cut out, it's their own fault.
[01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:54.920]   The thing is, and I just don't get along in groups very often.
[01:16:54.920 --> 01:16:56.400]   I don't like being dragged.
[01:16:56.400 --> 01:16:58.400]   The thing is, as I spent my entire school,
[01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:00.480]   I spent my entire school being dragged down
[01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:05.120]   because I was just constantly ready to do six other things
[01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:10.880]   and constantly being dragged down by the mass of the class.
[01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:14.440]   And the thing is, and I don't mean to sound like as elitist
[01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:15.560]   as that probably just came out.
[01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:18.200]   But the main thing is, I was very passionate about school.
[01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:21.080]   And by the time I was in third grade, I just stopped engaging.
[01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:22.320]   I just turned off.
[01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:25.360]   And what these textbooks--
[01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:27.440]   and I have to admit, the reason I'm so excited about this
[01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:28.720]   and the reason I'm so pushy about it
[01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:30.680]   is because I've been dreaming about these textbooks
[01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:33.200]   since I was like 10.
[01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:38.000]   The thing is that this is not just replacing textbooks.
[01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:41.000]   This technology, this type of technology,
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.600]   changes the way schools can work because as they move digital,
[01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:45.240]   it means that you can stop having grades.
[01:17:45.240 --> 01:17:48.200]   You can stop having grades like grade four, grade five, grade six.
[01:17:48.200 --> 01:17:50.880]   You can start customizing the curriculum to every student.
[01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:52.160]   You can start doing a lot of things
[01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:53.040]   that you're going to start seeing
[01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:55.240]   because everything moves into a digital format.
[01:17:55.240 --> 01:17:58.880]   And the fact that we're going to delay that by another decade
[01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:01.640]   because no one can figure out what standard they want to work at
[01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:04.640]   is a horrible, horrible thought to me.
[01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:08.440]   And as I said, I've been very impatient.
[01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:12.360]   I've been trying to do this kind of stuff for a decade.
[01:18:12.360 --> 01:18:15.040]   I've been dreaming about it for all 30 years.
[01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:17.160]   And so the thing is is that I am excited about it
[01:18:17.160 --> 01:18:18.520]   and I want a great tool.
[01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:22.080]   I don't want to wait anymore while these little bureaucrats
[01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:23.840]   try to figure out which way they want to go.
[01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:24.800]   I want to force something.
[01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:26.880]   And if people want to match it, then they can match it.
[01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:29.120]   But the thing is is that I just don't think Apple should
[01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:31.640]   have to dumb it down.
[01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:32.640]   No.
[01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:34.160]   I made my point.
[01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:36.160]   I just think that it's important to consider
[01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:38.240]   the potential consequences of something like this.
[01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:41.280]   And you could look at Khan Academy and say the same thing.
[01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:43.640]   Look how Khan Academy has transformed education
[01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:45.160]   and made education available.
[01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:51.160]   What we haven't even looked at is a lot of these Harvard
[01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:54.920]   Berkeley Stanford, they sell networking and certification.
[01:18:54.920 --> 01:18:56.360]   They're already giving away their education.
[01:18:56.360 --> 01:18:59.360]   How much longer before they start putting free textbooks?
[01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:00.960]   Like, here's the textbook for our physics.
[01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:02.000]   Here's the textbook for whatever.
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.920]   Basically, you can already go watch, go take all these.
[01:19:04.920 --> 01:19:07.120]   And this is, by the way, I was really excited about iTunes
[01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:10.160]   U for that reason because it suits all of these classes
[01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:11.960]   in the hands of people who cannot go to college.
[01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:15.000]   And before this app existed, it was too difficult for them
[01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.700]   to spend the resources to make-- to put all of their classroom
[01:19:17.700 --> 01:19:20.320]   materials online and to build interactive books
[01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:21.880]   and to do all of these other things.
[01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:24.800]   And so the thing is that we could see an enormous number
[01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:28.600]   of these high-end colleges putting this education out.
[01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:31.960]   And I think that that's from an education perspective,
[01:19:31.960 --> 01:19:33.200]   is exciting.
[01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:35.200]   Adam?
[01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:37.880]   Yeah, I was just going to comment on the whole textbook thing.
[01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:40.960]   And I think it's easy to get away from the fact
[01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:43.800]   that what Apple is doing is not ubiquitous in terms
[01:19:43.800 --> 01:19:47.720]   of supporting the standard, but it's not exclusive either.
[01:19:47.720 --> 01:19:49.880]   They're providing a new platform and a tool
[01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:52.280]   to get books onto iPads and devices.
[01:19:52.280 --> 01:19:54.880]   But there are no way, I think, saying
[01:19:54.880 --> 01:19:55.960]   that you're forced to do that.
[01:19:55.960 --> 01:19:58.040]   So I don't want to drag us back into that conversation
[01:19:58.040 --> 01:19:59.960]   because I'd like to talk a little bit about iTunes U.
[01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:02.600]   But there's nothing to preclude somebody
[01:20:02.600 --> 01:20:05.040]   from developing workflow where they produce an ePub
[01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:07.640]   or they produce a Kindle standard version
[01:20:07.640 --> 01:20:10.640]   and then move into the Apple tool and produce their iBook
[01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:11.720]   version and sell it everywhere.
[01:20:11.720 --> 01:20:14.360]   And I think a publisher or anybody making that content
[01:20:14.360 --> 01:20:16.680]   would be cutting out huge portions of their market
[01:20:16.680 --> 01:20:18.600]   just going after Apple.
[01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:20.520]   I think a lot of them are going to want to go after Apple
[01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:22.120]   and be in the iBook store and build these books.
[01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:25.480]   But I see very few people going exclusive,
[01:20:25.480 --> 01:20:26.760]   even with the tool as it does.
[01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:29.920]   Well, and that was a conversation we had on Twitch
[01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:34.240]   with Ed Bot and Mike Elgin, who had a similar disagreement.
[01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:37.720]   And the point Ed had made is that in general, what happens
[01:20:37.720 --> 01:20:40.720]   is it's a lot of work to do each of these versions.
[01:20:40.720 --> 01:20:44.440]   And so what does happen is publishers
[01:20:44.440 --> 01:20:45.800]   do have to make choices.
[01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:49.000]   It's a lot of work to develop for Android and iPhone.
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:50.680]   They do end up making choices.
[01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:53.600]   And so that's the risk.
[01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:54.600]   I agree.
[01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:57.560]   I don't think that it's a clear and present danger.
[01:20:57.560 --> 01:20:58.360]   But it's the risk.
[01:20:58.360 --> 01:20:59.800]   And it's one of the reasons I don't
[01:20:59.800 --> 01:21:04.720]   like seeing one company try to co-opt an entire industry.
[01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:08.120]   If, in fact, Amazon--
[01:21:08.120 --> 01:21:10.840]   I'm sure Amazon's not going to roll over and die.
[01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:12.920]   This is a big business for them.
[01:21:12.920 --> 01:21:15.400]   If, in fact, you have Amazon, maybe Google, too,
[01:21:15.400 --> 01:21:16.840]   getting involved in this.
[01:21:16.840 --> 01:21:19.880]   And I think HTML5 is a great standard.
[01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:23.480]   I'd like to see support for HTML5 Plus.
[01:21:23.480 --> 01:21:25.560]   And that's the problem.
[01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:27.040]   And so let's see if we can--
[01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:29.280]   maybe we could do it without the proprietary Plus.
[01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:30.000]   I don't know.
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:33.040]   A lot of companies say the proprietary thing is, well,
[01:21:33.040 --> 01:21:33.960]   we're just making it better.
[01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:35.640]   But really, what they're really saying
[01:21:35.640 --> 01:21:39.240]   is we want to corner a market by having
[01:21:39.240 --> 01:21:43.360]   proprietary incompatible extensions to a standard
[01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:44.520]   so that we can own it.
[01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:47.000]   Does Apple want to own the textbook market?
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:47.520]   Probably.
[01:21:47.520 --> 01:21:48.720]   Will they?
[01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:49.840]   Remains to be seen.
[01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:50.880]   I think you're right, Adam.
[01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:53.320]   I think that there will be a lot more variety.
[01:21:53.320 --> 01:21:55.040]   I hope that's the case.
[01:21:55.040 --> 01:21:55.800]   I hope that's the case.
[01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:58.920]   And I hope that the fact that Pearson, McGraw-Hill,
[01:21:58.920 --> 01:22:01.720]   and Harcourt-Brace, or whoever they are--
[01:22:01.720 --> 01:22:04.720]   what is the name of Hooten-Lifflin-Harkcourt?
[01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:06.200]   So many names.
[01:22:06.200 --> 01:22:07.280]   Is it Hooten or Hooten?
[01:22:07.280 --> 01:22:08.480]   Hooten, I think.
[01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:10.320]   I'm going to say Hooten then.
[01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:11.800]   Hooten-Nanny.
[01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:14.480]   The fact that they're all three out there, but not on the stage.
[01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:16.360]   I think everybody's hedging their bets a little bit.
[01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:17.520]   I think people are watching.
[01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:18.720]   I think they're definitely going to develop
[01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:21.040]   into a lot of different--
[01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:22.400]   there's going to be a lot of different formats.
[01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:24.720]   I don't think that Apple's going to have a definitive--
[01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:28.920]   I think what I'm excited about by this application
[01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:31.440]   is I do think other people are going to build tools that do this.
[01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:34.080]   And I think that what happens is this creates an arms race
[01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:34.880]   for building great stuff.
[01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:36.320]   I hope that's the case.
[01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:36.880]   Great stuff.
[01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:40.160]   Like, no longer can you keep on packaging the past into a Kindle.
[01:22:40.160 --> 01:22:41.880]   This is one way to improve education.
[01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:42.480]   Absolutely.
[01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:46.080]   Yeah, and so the thing is that you now have to start
[01:22:46.080 --> 01:22:48.240]   thinking outside the box, and people are going to have to do it.
[01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:49.920]   And if Apple starts making inroads,
[01:22:49.920 --> 01:22:53.320]   people will build tools to do EPUB3 and everything else
[01:22:53.320 --> 01:22:55.160]   because that's a big market.
[01:22:55.160 --> 01:22:56.600]   And they want to take advantage of that.
[01:22:56.600 --> 01:22:59.320]   But it's enough of this text.
[01:22:59.320 --> 01:23:00.560]   I tunes you, Adam.
[01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:02.400]   He said you wanted to talk about that a little bit.
[01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:04.240]   Well, I'm just excited I changed you
[01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:07.640]   because I think it was one of these underutilized resources
[01:23:07.640 --> 01:23:08.360]   that was available on--
[01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:11.080]   I think people didn't even know it existed because it was buried.
[01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:12.320]   Yeah.
[01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:13.680]   It brings it to the forefront.
[01:23:13.680 --> 01:23:15.320]   But the big problem it always had
[01:23:15.320 --> 01:23:19.840]   was it was sort of this kind of podcast remote learning thing.
[01:23:19.840 --> 01:23:22.720]   And you still had to go to a website to get the materials,
[01:23:22.720 --> 01:23:24.800]   the supporting materials for these courses that you could take.
[01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:29.480]   But it's Steve Jobs' vision of dropping out and dropping in,
[01:23:29.480 --> 01:23:31.040]   but in a virtual sense.
[01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:33.000]   And now with the app, they're bringing it all together,
[01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:36.160]   where all of your course materials are in one place.
[01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:37.400]   You get the PDF.
[01:23:37.400 --> 01:23:39.920]   It seamlessly transitions back and forth
[01:23:39.920 --> 01:23:42.080]   between iBooks and the iTunes U app.
[01:23:42.080 --> 01:23:44.520]   You're highlighting and notes go along, everything syncs.
[01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:47.240]   So it makes it much easier to experience these courses.
[01:23:47.240 --> 01:23:49.720]   And I love the fact, too, that it's streaming.
[01:23:49.720 --> 01:23:50.640]   That was another problem.
[01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:52.400]   As a lot of these courses have a lot of video,
[01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:53.600]   you'd have to download all of it.
[01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:55.600]   Now you can stream it right on your iPad.
[01:23:55.600 --> 01:23:58.640]   You can answer review questions right in the notes within it.
[01:23:58.640 --> 01:24:01.200]   And keep it all in one place and makes it much easier
[01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:04.000]   to just have the experience and puts forth the exposure
[01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.400]   for these things right there with an app.
[01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:10.640]   So here's Duke University core concepts in chemistry.
[01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:11.800]   You could subscribe for free.
[01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:13.040]   They do have some paid elements.
[01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:15.600]   For instance, the Wolfram general chemistry course
[01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:16.680]   assistance $5.
[01:24:16.680 --> 01:24:17.920]   So you can add that in.
[01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:22.360]   But then the rest, there's 471 pieces of material.
[01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:26.920]   Including the lectures, the notes, the syllabus.
[01:24:26.920 --> 01:24:28.160]   I mean, this is just--
[01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:30.600]   On how exciting does this get when they start doing interaction?
[01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:33.160]   I mean, you know, like when these big colleges start
[01:24:33.160 --> 01:24:34.240]   posting some of this.
[01:24:34.240 --> 01:24:35.080]   It's huge.
[01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:38.320]   Yale, my alma mater, has always done these open courses.
[01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:40.240]   I've been taking-- I mentioned this before--
[01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:42.960]   Don Kagan's course on death.
[01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:45.280]   But it's just video lectures.
[01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:46.760]   Now it'll have the notes.
[01:24:46.760 --> 01:24:47.640]   It'll have materials.
[01:24:47.640 --> 01:24:50.640]   It'll have-- you're right, tests.
[01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:53.080]   This means that-- and you don't have to, by the way,
[01:24:53.080 --> 01:24:55.560]   have an iPad, although it's sure a lot better on an iPad.
[01:24:55.560 --> 01:24:58.080]   You could do this on an iPod, Dutch, or an iPod.
[01:24:58.080 --> 01:24:59.320]   But again, it's proprietary.
[01:24:59.320 --> 01:25:00.880]   Let's acknowledge this.
[01:25:00.880 --> 01:25:02.360]   I suspect that the amount of effort
[01:25:02.360 --> 01:25:05.240]   that colleges put into making an iPad version
[01:25:05.240 --> 01:25:07.440]   probably goes a long way to making it available on the web
[01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:08.960]   as well.
[01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:11.240]   I would hope so.
[01:25:11.240 --> 01:25:13.040]   Did they get rid of the-- did they get rid of it?
[01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:14.640]   They didn't get rid of it in iTunes though, right?
[01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:16.440]   So you can download iTunes for your PC
[01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:17.520]   and take it that way.
[01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:18.440]   Yeah, it's Windows or Mac.
[01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:18.920]   That's right.
[01:25:18.920 --> 01:25:21.520]   It could be on any computer.
[01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:23.280]   So if I'm going to take core concepts in chemistry,
[01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:24.240]   look how nice this looks.
[01:25:24.240 --> 01:25:25.920]   We've got a tabbed thing.
[01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:26.960]   There's interactivity.
[01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:31.000]   You see I can actually participate in this.
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:32.880]   My course notes.
[01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:34.600]   All these other materials are available.
[01:25:34.600 --> 01:25:36.080]   I mean, this is--
[01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:38.680]   you could take a Duke University,
[01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:40.600]   one of the top universities in the world,
[01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:44.840]   introduction to core concepts in chemistry, free,
[01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:47.040]   if you have a computer.
[01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:49.680]   Isn't that a cool statement that they're making though,
[01:25:49.680 --> 01:25:53.680]   that the value thing that you're buying is the credential.
[01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:55.360]   The information is worthless.
[01:25:55.360 --> 01:25:59.200]   Well, it's funny because I served on a committee at Yale
[01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:00.480]   to digitize Yale's assets.
[01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:03.520]   And that's exactly-- as you said and as Adam said,
[01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:05.320]   it's about the connections you make.
[01:26:05.320 --> 01:26:09.000]   It's about the piece of paper, the sheepskin you get.
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:10.960]   They've always seen it as their mission
[01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:13.440]   to put the content out.
[01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:15.080]   Yale said-- and I think every university
[01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:16.280]   or many universities say this-- look,
[01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:19.760]   our job is to distribute this information.
[01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:21.200]   And we want to do it freely.
[01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:23.960]   We're not trying to make money off of it.
[01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:26.720]   But the idea of making this available--
[01:26:26.720 --> 01:26:29.200]   and they have to put a lot of money into this.
[01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:32.920]   This is not a trivial or cheap thing to do.
[01:26:32.920 --> 01:26:34.480]   It's just fantastic.
[01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:36.560]   It's in a way-- I think it's marketing for a university.
[01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:39.440]   So that might be one of the reasons they're willing to do this.
[01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:40.600]   We'll see.
[01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:42.200]   I think it fits the mission.
[01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:44.760]   Most universities are nonprofit, right?
[01:26:44.760 --> 01:26:48.560]   iPad and iPhone app development-- Stanford's put this course out
[01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:51.080]   every year.
[01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:53.640]   They updated every single year.
[01:26:53.640 --> 01:26:56.520]   In the past, they've made some of the materials
[01:26:56.520 --> 01:26:57.440]   and the lectures available.
[01:26:57.440 --> 01:26:59.080]   Now, it's all here.
[01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:00.080]   The lecture slides.
[01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:04.680]   My first iOS app, iOS 5 walk through all of this stuff.
[01:27:04.680 --> 01:27:06.240]   If you wanted to become an iOS developer,
[01:27:06.240 --> 01:27:09.400]   this is a course taught by Stanford Computer Science
[01:27:09.400 --> 01:27:11.960]   Professors and Apple employees.
[01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:13.120]   Many of them are favorite.
[01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:16.320]   Apple Apps came out of this course free.
[01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:18.560]   Fantastic.
[01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:19.160]   Just a few minutes.
[01:27:19.160 --> 01:27:20.440]   I'm going to subscribe to that one.
[01:27:20.440 --> 01:27:21.400]   I take this course every year.
[01:27:21.400 --> 01:27:23.600]   I never get any better, but I take it.
[01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:26.000]   And now I guess it's open to K through 12.
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:29.680]   I'm curious to see how that works or what's put forth there.
[01:27:29.680 --> 01:27:31.480]   But just the ability to share that course,
[01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:34.320]   work in lessons among schools I would even imagine
[01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:36.800]   is going to help everybody in the long run.
[01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:37.320]   Exactly.
[01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:38.840]   That was the first thing that struck me
[01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:42.760]   is huge to share curricula to--
[01:27:42.760 --> 01:27:45.240]   Well, you could have students doing their research papers
[01:27:45.240 --> 01:27:47.720]   in the iBooks author, for instance, where
[01:27:47.720 --> 01:27:48.840]   that's an interesting idea.
[01:27:48.840 --> 01:27:51.960]   You know, they're really able to dig into all of that
[01:27:51.960 --> 01:27:53.760]   and put together really interesting reports.
[01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:55.360]   I know if I was a teacher, that's you.
[01:27:55.360 --> 01:27:57.600]   As everyone watching the last half an hour knows,
[01:27:57.600 --> 01:28:00.560]   if I was a teacher, they'd all be building in iBooks author.
[01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:02.080]   But the--
[01:28:02.080 --> 01:28:03.680]   I'm saying that gives you the ability
[01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:05.560]   to set up a virtual library.
[01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:08.760]   Those can go into a repository, a server on the schools.
[01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:09.600]   You know, system.
[01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:11.840]   And you could have that there for the next generation
[01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:14.280]   of students coming through to do their research off of,
[01:28:14.280 --> 01:28:17.480]   and then add to and expand and then put their stuff back in.
[01:28:17.480 --> 01:28:19.120]   And I think that gets really, really interesting.
[01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:23.360]   I'd love to see Apple do a competition of like best--
[01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:26.840]   on a certain subject, best student, Bill iBook,
[01:28:26.840 --> 01:28:29.040]   you know, on physics or something like that.
[01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:29.320]   So they--
[01:28:29.320 --> 01:28:30.320]   With the IPOs.
[01:28:30.320 --> 01:28:31.520]   It can only be 10 pages long.
[01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:33.920]   You know, and then it's going to go into the iTunes library.
[01:28:33.920 --> 01:28:35.680]   It's something of thousands of students, you know,
[01:28:35.680 --> 01:28:38.280]   and maybe the grand prize is 20 max for a lab or something.
[01:28:38.280 --> 01:28:39.280]   And if most--
[01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:41.360]   It's because most people watching are really smart.
[01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:42.120]   If--
[01:28:42.120 --> 01:28:46.520]   Imagine that these guys, you know, and gals who watch--
[01:28:46.520 --> 01:28:48.160]   by the time they're like 14 or 15,
[01:28:48.160 --> 01:28:51.560]   they've now already taken college courses in computer science
[01:28:51.560 --> 01:28:53.640]   or physics or whatever they're turned on by.
[01:28:53.640 --> 01:28:56.320]   It just-- if you're motivated, if you want to learn,
[01:28:56.320 --> 01:28:58.960]   the opportunity to learn now is just phenomenal.
[01:28:58.960 --> 01:28:59.480]   Yeah.
[01:28:59.480 --> 01:28:59.800]   Absolutely.
[01:28:59.800 --> 01:29:01.560]   What a revolution.
[01:29:01.560 --> 01:29:03.720]   And so you understand it's a mixed--
[01:29:03.720 --> 01:29:06.760]   I've mixed feelings about this.
[01:29:06.760 --> 01:29:08.600]   You know, and it is such a huge opportunity.
[01:29:08.600 --> 01:29:12.360]   And education is so important to our future.
[01:29:12.360 --> 01:29:15.040]   This just in.
[01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:17.840]   Steve Jobs-Widdo will be sitting next to Michelle Obama
[01:29:17.840 --> 01:29:19.240]   at the State of the Union tonight.
[01:29:19.240 --> 01:29:20.160]   Wow.
[01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:26.160]   Don't know if that means anything, but breaking news.
[01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:29.360]   We're going to take a break and come back with more.
[01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:32.920]   Do you want to do iOS and Lion tips and all of that picks?
[01:29:32.920 --> 01:29:33.720]   I got them.
[01:29:33.720 --> 01:29:35.080]   I know what your pick is.
[01:29:35.080 --> 01:29:35.840]   No, I don't know.
[01:29:35.840 --> 01:29:38.240]   I don't know.
[01:29:38.240 --> 01:29:41.560]   And we'll leave the rumors for next week about the--
[01:29:41.560 --> 01:29:45.240]   just let me just pull you real quickly.
[01:29:45.240 --> 01:29:47.400]   If Apple's going to come out with an iPad in March, which
[01:29:47.400 --> 01:29:50.800]   they have every year up to now, wouldn't they
[01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:52.480]   announce it next month?
[01:29:52.480 --> 01:29:53.640]   Are we going to see an iPad-- are we
[01:29:53.640 --> 01:29:55.760]   going to see an Apple event next month?
[01:29:55.760 --> 01:29:57.160]   Andy?
[01:29:57.160 --> 01:30:00.840]   Would cautiously vote yes.
[01:30:00.840 --> 01:30:03.640]   A retina display makes a lot more sense when you have iBooks.
[01:30:03.640 --> 01:30:04.440]   I sure don't.
[01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:06.960]   I also noticed that all the elements in iBooks author
[01:30:06.960 --> 01:30:09.720]   are double resolution.
[01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:11.240]   Adam, you agree?
[01:30:11.240 --> 01:30:15.760]   Yeah, I think it's going to happen in the next month or so.
[01:30:15.760 --> 01:30:16.200]   Yeah.
[01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:18.560]   It's exciting.
[01:30:18.560 --> 01:30:20.960]   It's going to be very exciting.
[01:30:20.960 --> 01:30:23.440]   Virgin is named an airplane after Steve Jobs, by the way.
[01:30:23.440 --> 01:30:24.600]   Do we think that--
[01:30:24.600 --> 01:30:26.480]   Do we think that--
[01:30:26.480 --> 01:30:28.680]   See, I don't know if--
[01:30:28.680 --> 01:30:31.480]   every time we hear the name of a plane,
[01:30:31.480 --> 01:30:32.640]   what was the quote they put on?
[01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:34.520]   It's actually written on the nose of the plane.
[01:30:34.520 --> 01:30:36.200]   Stay hungry, stay foolish.
[01:30:36.200 --> 01:30:36.920]   Yeah, and exactly.
[01:30:36.920 --> 01:30:40.880]   Now, you know how many arguments they had in that border.
[01:30:40.880 --> 01:30:43.360]   My god forbid this plane should crash.
[01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:44.160]   Oh, that's the point.
[01:30:44.160 --> 01:30:45.240]   I know that one video clip is going
[01:30:45.240 --> 01:30:47.960]   to be that low-- that shredded piece of wreckage,
[01:30:47.960 --> 01:30:51.880]   stay foolish, coming out of a swamp.
[01:30:51.880 --> 01:30:55.640]   You saw that the International Bus Association,
[01:30:55.640 --> 01:30:57.680]   or whatever they call it, are pissed off about the Priceline
[01:30:57.680 --> 01:31:02.440]   ad, where William Shatner dies in a fiery bus crash.
[01:31:02.440 --> 01:31:04.040]   This stuff can-- this cuffic ruin of it.
[01:31:04.040 --> 01:31:06.840]   They're also upset about the finale of the young ones, too.
[01:31:06.840 --> 01:31:08.440]   So they hold a grudge.
[01:31:08.440 --> 01:31:09.560]   We're going to take a break.
[01:31:09.560 --> 01:31:12.240]   We've got Adam Christensen here from MacCast.
[01:31:12.240 --> 01:31:15.200]   We've got Andy Inato here from Chicago, sometimes,
[01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:19.320]   both about to fly to San Francisco for Macworld Expo.
[01:31:19.320 --> 01:31:21.520]   We've got Alex Lindsey here from the Pixel Core
[01:31:21.520 --> 01:31:23.520]   in his brand new business, iBook.
[01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:24.760]   iBookauthors.com.
[01:31:24.760 --> 01:31:25.120]   I don't know.
[01:31:25.120 --> 01:31:26.200]   What are you going to call the--
[01:31:26.200 --> 01:31:27.160]   Stevie Garage.
[01:31:27.160 --> 01:31:28.240]   Stevie Garage is going to do it all?
[01:31:28.240 --> 01:31:29.560]   That's going to be the business.
[01:31:29.560 --> 01:31:35.200]   If you need help making your next iBook, this is the man.
[01:31:35.200 --> 01:31:35.840]   Call me in a month.
[01:31:35.840 --> 01:31:36.480]   I'll bring you.
[01:31:36.480 --> 01:31:37.760]   Yeah, he's already booked a little bit.
[01:31:37.760 --> 01:31:39.280]   He's already booked.
[01:31:39.280 --> 01:31:41.200]   I'll bring my resume, my interview suit.
[01:31:41.200 --> 01:31:44.040]   If I can get half out of your time tomorrow.
[01:31:44.040 --> 01:31:46.280]   Liz, learn iBook author now.
[01:31:46.280 --> 01:31:47.280]   Stat.
[01:31:47.280 --> 01:31:49.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:31:49.320 --> 01:31:50.680]   It is-- and I don't even think of it.
[01:31:50.680 --> 01:31:52.200]   You've booked that much business already.
[01:31:52.200 --> 01:31:53.520]   That's just the only thing about it.
[01:31:53.520 --> 01:31:55.640]   To be fair, I will say that I've been talking about developing
[01:31:55.640 --> 01:31:57.640]   for the iPad with many different clients.
[01:31:57.640 --> 01:31:59.040]   No, you've wanted to do this forever.
[01:31:59.040 --> 01:32:00.120]   For-- since it came out.
[01:32:00.120 --> 01:32:01.960]   And so I kept on saying, oh, if we only have pages doing it,
[01:32:01.960 --> 01:32:02.960]   well, this is better than pages.
[01:32:02.960 --> 01:32:04.960]   And it's not the normal clients I have.
[01:32:04.960 --> 01:32:05.680]   It's different ones.
[01:32:05.680 --> 01:32:08.400]   But I've been talking to eight or 10 of them for a year.
[01:32:08.400 --> 01:32:10.520]   So it was just me saying, OK, now we can do it.
[01:32:10.520 --> 01:32:11.200]   Now we can do it.
[01:32:11.200 --> 01:32:13.080]   Because I've been hedging my-- I've been not saying anything
[01:32:13.080 --> 01:32:14.960]   about it, not calling anybody, because I didn't know
[01:32:14.960 --> 01:32:16.040]   how I was going to develop the content.
[01:32:16.040 --> 01:32:18.920]   You could have come over here and just whispered in my ear,
[01:32:18.920 --> 01:32:20.800]   you know, you might want to learn it.
[01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:22.880]   Well, there was nothing to learn until Thursday.
[01:32:22.880 --> 01:32:24.560]   So good thing to learn how to do.
[01:32:24.560 --> 01:32:26.160]   It'd be really good if you had video cameras.
[01:32:26.160 --> 01:32:26.720]   Oh, wait, you do.
[01:32:26.720 --> 01:32:27.240]   Wait a minute.
[01:32:27.240 --> 01:32:28.160]   No, I don't do that.
[01:32:28.160 --> 01:32:30.000]   Yes, see?
[01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:31.440]   This portion.
[01:32:31.440 --> 01:32:34.120]   And by the way, if we did a book, I would not put ads in it.
[01:32:34.120 --> 01:32:35.920]   Somebody was saying, don't put ads in it.
[01:32:35.920 --> 01:32:36.600]   You could.
[01:32:36.600 --> 01:32:37.640]   I'm just saying you could.
[01:32:37.640 --> 01:32:38.560]   But here's the thing.
[01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:39.800]   Is it cost money to do those things?
[01:32:39.800 --> 01:32:41.200]   So there are some people that--
[01:32:41.200 --> 01:32:41.880]   It's promotional.
[01:32:41.880 --> 01:32:43.960]   You get a free-- if you got a free book.
[01:32:43.960 --> 01:32:46.080]   For us, we would do them as promotional.
[01:32:46.080 --> 01:32:48.560]   But for other people, instead of charging people,
[01:32:48.560 --> 01:32:50.640]   if all you had to do was switch through an ad.
[01:32:50.640 --> 01:32:52.560]   But see, already, see, this is how it sucks you in.
[01:32:52.560 --> 01:32:55.520]   Because I could do it on the web with web standards.
[01:32:55.520 --> 01:32:57.680]   Or I could make it a whole an eyeball.
[01:32:57.680 --> 01:32:59.240]   Could be so much cooler.
[01:32:59.240 --> 01:32:59.840]   Yeah.
[01:32:59.840 --> 01:33:02.200]   See how it sucks you in?
[01:33:02.200 --> 01:33:05.320]   And I could sell lots of iPads for Apple.
[01:33:05.320 --> 01:33:08.000]   This show brought to you by GoToMeeting.
[01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:09.160]   Now this I'd like to sell you.
[01:33:09.160 --> 01:33:11.240]   I was talking the other day to--
[01:33:11.240 --> 01:33:12.640]   I was given a tour to somebody.
[01:33:12.640 --> 01:33:13.480]   Oh, it was our lullaby.
[01:33:13.480 --> 01:33:15.880]   It was our new web design firm.
[01:33:15.880 --> 01:33:17.920]   They're going to be doing the Tech Guy site.
[01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:19.040]   And they're a virtual company.
[01:33:19.040 --> 01:33:21.040]   As many companies are these days.
[01:33:21.040 --> 01:33:23.880]   And they have to have meetings with developers, designers,
[01:33:23.880 --> 01:33:25.840]   business people all over the world.
[01:33:25.840 --> 01:33:27.760]   And Jeff, who lives in Providence, Rhode Island, said,
[01:33:27.760 --> 01:33:28.800]   I said, how do you do this?
[01:33:28.800 --> 01:33:29.800]   He said, how do you keep everybody?
[01:33:29.800 --> 01:33:30.600]   He said, go to meeting.
[01:33:30.600 --> 01:33:32.680]   I said, oh, I love hearing that.
[01:33:32.680 --> 01:33:34.600]   Go to meeting.
[01:33:34.600 --> 01:33:36.600]   For years, we've used GoToMeeting as screen sharing.
[01:33:36.600 --> 01:33:38.320]   So you show your screen.
[01:33:38.320 --> 01:33:40.320]   It's good for the obvious use.
[01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:42.400]   I've got a keynote or a PowerPoint presentation.
[01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:44.600]   I want to show a client, make him a pitch.
[01:33:44.600 --> 01:33:45.760]   So people would use it like that.
[01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:46.800]   Very easy to install.
[01:33:46.800 --> 01:33:48.480]   The client doesn't have to have any software installed.
[01:33:48.480 --> 01:33:49.760]   Ahead of time, he just clicks a link.
[01:33:49.760 --> 01:33:51.800]   It installs itself.
[01:33:51.800 --> 01:33:52.800]   It's fast.
[01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:55.520]   It's secure.
[01:33:55.520 --> 01:33:57.040]   And then they added HD faces.
[01:33:57.040 --> 01:34:00.240]   Now suddenly, you've got video conferencing built in
[01:34:00.240 --> 01:34:02.600]   with the same platform.
[01:34:02.600 --> 01:34:03.560]   Easy to use.
[01:34:03.560 --> 01:34:06.480]   Crystal clear video, HD video.
[01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:08.080]   This is a revolution.
[01:34:08.080 --> 01:34:12.120]   Go to meeting with HD faces from Citrix is really fantastic.
[01:34:12.120 --> 01:34:14.880]   I want you to check it out.
[01:34:14.880 --> 01:34:17.880]   Just the idea of seeing the people you meet with, seeing
[01:34:17.880 --> 01:34:20.240]   their body language, their faces.
[01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:22.600]   It's how you make connections with your clients,
[01:34:22.600 --> 01:34:23.760]   with your colleagues.
[01:34:23.760 --> 01:34:26.080]   It's how you can run a business virtually, just like Lolo
[01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:27.080]   Button.
[01:34:27.080 --> 01:34:28.880]   I didn't ask their permission to use their name.
[01:34:28.880 --> 01:34:30.720]   But hey, he told me that.
[01:34:30.720 --> 01:34:31.720]   It's true.
[01:34:31.720 --> 01:34:32.320]   So here's the deal.
[01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:34.240]   You go to go to meeting.com, visit the website,
[01:34:34.240 --> 01:34:35.760]   gotometing.com.
[01:34:35.760 --> 01:34:38.280]   Click the try it free button.
[01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:40.920]   And the promo code is Macbreak.
[01:34:40.920 --> 01:34:42.400]   And you can try this free for 30 days.
[01:34:42.400 --> 01:34:45.600]   So I'm not asking you to do anything without trying it.
[01:34:45.600 --> 01:34:47.960]   All of our advertisers, we always
[01:34:47.960 --> 01:34:50.800]   ask them to give you a free trial of some kind.
[01:34:50.800 --> 01:34:52.320]   This is a good way to do it.
[01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:55.440]   Go to meeting.com, click the try it free button.
[01:34:55.440 --> 01:34:56.640]   That big orange button there.
[01:34:56.640 --> 01:34:58.640]   And enter in the offer code Macbreak.
[01:34:58.640 --> 01:35:00.280]   And you can try it free for 30 days.
[01:35:00.280 --> 01:35:01.720]   All you need is a video camera.
[01:35:01.720 --> 01:35:02.880]   Almost everybody has one now.
[01:35:02.880 --> 01:35:05.760]   If you've got one on your iMac, you've got HD already.
[01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:08.200]   Works great on the Macintosh.
[01:35:08.200 --> 01:35:11.080]   You know what's nice is that they don't need to be using
[01:35:11.080 --> 01:35:12.840]   a Mac or Windows or you using it.
[01:35:12.840 --> 01:35:17.200]   You can just-- everybody-- it's completely cross platform.
[01:35:17.200 --> 01:35:18.680]   Everybody can use it.
[01:35:18.680 --> 01:35:19.480]   Go to meeting.
[01:35:19.480 --> 01:35:20.040]   Give it a try.
[01:35:20.040 --> 01:35:21.000]   I think you'll like it.
[01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:25.320]   And we thank them for their support of Macbreak Weekly.
[01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:27.600]   So before the show, did you talk about the Academy Award
[01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:29.160]   nominations?
[01:35:29.160 --> 01:35:29.640]   No.
[01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:30.200]   They're out.
[01:35:30.200 --> 01:35:31.600]   No.
[01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:34.920]   This is number for Albert Brooks and Pat Naswald OMG.
[01:35:34.920 --> 01:35:37.360]   No.
[01:35:37.360 --> 01:35:40.840]   But I like the best picture nominees.
[01:35:40.840 --> 01:35:41.760]   The artist, which I haven't seen,
[01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:44.880]   but that's a black and white silent film.
[01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:45.960]   10 nominees though.
[01:35:45.960 --> 01:35:46.480]   I mean--
[01:35:46.480 --> 01:35:47.880]   I know too many.
[01:35:47.880 --> 01:35:50.400]   The Descendants, which is a great film with George Clooney.
[01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:53.160]   I do recommend kind of a downer, but good.
[01:35:53.160 --> 01:35:55.320]   Haven't seen it extremely loud and incredibly close.
[01:35:55.320 --> 01:35:57.920]   It sounded painful.
[01:35:57.920 --> 01:36:01.000]   Is that a Jim Carrey movie?
[01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:04.280]   No, that's the Tom Hanks movie about the child who
[01:36:04.280 --> 01:36:06.760]   was lost his father in the 9/11 attacks.
[01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:07.880]   Oh, yeah.
[01:36:07.880 --> 01:36:11.680]   But with Tom Hanks as the deceased.
[01:36:11.680 --> 01:36:12.040]   Really?
[01:36:12.040 --> 01:36:13.680]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:36:13.680 --> 01:36:15.120]   The help?
[01:36:15.120 --> 01:36:15.480]   Oh, go ahead.
[01:36:15.480 --> 01:36:17.080]   I'm sorry.
[01:36:17.080 --> 01:36:19.440]   Interesting, Bridesmaids is nominated
[01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:22.120]   for Best Original Screenplay.
[01:36:22.120 --> 01:36:23.240]   Rightly so.
[01:36:23.240 --> 01:36:23.560]   Rightly so.
[01:36:23.560 --> 01:36:24.720]   And very funny.
[01:36:24.720 --> 01:36:29.040]   You know Pixar movies nominated for animated wars.
[01:36:29.040 --> 01:36:30.840]   They must hate that because it looks like there's
[01:36:30.840 --> 01:36:33.400]   three dreamworks, right?
[01:36:33.400 --> 01:36:35.680]   Kung Fu Panda, Puss and Boots and Rango.
[01:36:35.680 --> 01:36:37.120]   Aren't those all?
[01:36:37.120 --> 01:36:38.920]   The other guys?
[01:36:38.920 --> 01:36:39.280]   No.
[01:36:39.280 --> 01:36:40.960]   They're not Disney.
[01:36:40.960 --> 01:36:43.520]   I can't remember whether Rango is--
[01:36:43.520 --> 01:36:45.600]   I think Rango's Paramount.
[01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:46.160]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:36:46.160 --> 01:36:49.440]   That's fine.
[01:36:49.440 --> 01:36:54.800]   I was also a best actor in supporting role, Jonah Hill.
[01:36:54.800 --> 01:36:56.760]   Jonah Hill is now an Academy Award nominated.
[01:36:56.760 --> 01:36:57.600]   He should be.
[01:36:57.600 --> 01:36:58.200]   He was great.
[01:36:58.200 --> 01:36:58.760]   Which is great.
[01:36:58.760 --> 01:36:59.360]   Which is great.
[01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:04.240]   It's just that three years ago, you don't picture which one
[01:37:04.240 --> 01:37:06.560]   is different from the others.
[01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:09.800]   So just goes to show the right actor in the right role.
[01:37:09.800 --> 01:37:12.840]   Jonah Hill is kind of the chubby guy who's always like,
[01:37:12.840 --> 01:37:14.120]   I got a picture of him.
[01:37:14.120 --> 01:37:15.560]   He's one of those great character actors
[01:37:15.560 --> 01:37:17.880]   that you don't know their name, but you immediately
[01:37:17.880 --> 01:37:20.920]   know them when you see them.
[01:37:20.920 --> 01:37:22.720]   And he was good in Moneyball as the Wizkid.
[01:37:22.720 --> 01:37:24.640]   He was the nerd in Moneyball.
[01:37:24.640 --> 01:37:25.480]   Good casting.
[01:37:25.480 --> 01:37:26.560]   I'll win up.
[01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:29.800]   Also, Moneyball nominated for Best Picture.
[01:37:29.800 --> 01:37:31.640]   Midnight in Paris, which I just watched last night
[01:37:31.640 --> 01:37:32.400]   and is wonderful.
[01:37:32.400 --> 01:37:33.240]   It's a Woody Allen film.
[01:37:33.240 --> 01:37:36.480]   Hugo also in Paris, two films in Paris.
[01:37:36.480 --> 01:37:37.320]   I like Hugo.
[01:37:37.320 --> 01:37:38.760]   Don't see it in 3D because you have
[01:37:38.760 --> 01:37:40.360]   to wear strange glasses and it's weird.
[01:37:40.360 --> 01:37:41.320]   You do see it.
[01:37:41.320 --> 01:37:43.400]   I'm curious to see what this will say about best
[01:37:43.400 --> 01:37:44.360]   in a photography.
[01:37:44.360 --> 01:37:47.800]   It's also nominated in cinematography category.
[01:37:47.800 --> 01:37:52.120]   Given that cinematography is defined as the photography,
[01:37:52.120 --> 01:37:53.840]   how does this look as a photograph?
[01:37:53.840 --> 01:37:56.880]   Given that it's 3D, so there's no analog
[01:37:56.880 --> 01:37:58.720]   to two dimensions at all,
[01:37:58.720 --> 01:38:00.520]   I wonder how that's going to play.
[01:38:00.520 --> 01:38:01.920]   He has the advantage.
[01:38:01.920 --> 01:38:04.160]   I mean, it is Scorsese.
[01:38:04.160 --> 01:38:05.760]   Midnight in Moneyball.
[01:38:05.760 --> 01:38:08.120]   No nomination for Andy Serkis.
[01:38:08.120 --> 01:38:08.960]   Thank you very much.
[01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:10.240]   That's a little disappointing.
[01:38:10.240 --> 01:38:15.280]   Andy is the guy who became the character actor in--
[01:38:15.280 --> 01:38:16.280]   he was Gollum.
[01:38:16.280 --> 01:38:19.000]   And then he did an amazing job in the rise
[01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:20.000]   of the Planet of the Apes.
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:21.120]   Planet of the Apes, right.
[01:38:21.120 --> 01:38:23.720]   Everyone sort of had their eye on whether or not
[01:38:23.720 --> 01:38:25.840]   this was going to demonstrate how does the Academy
[01:38:25.840 --> 01:38:30.160]   feel about motion capture actors in actual, like,
[01:38:30.160 --> 01:38:31.280]   best actor in the Apes.
[01:38:31.280 --> 01:38:34.800]   As a visual effects artist, I'm on a couple of lists
[01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:37.560]   of alumni and guys that work at high end visual effects.
[01:38:37.560 --> 01:38:42.280]   And the Andy Serkis nomination was extremely controversial.
[01:38:42.280 --> 01:38:44.760]   Or anything you talk about it because how much of it
[01:38:44.760 --> 01:38:45.760]   was his performance, how much was his computer?
[01:38:45.760 --> 01:38:47.360]   So much of that work is being done by animators.
[01:38:47.360 --> 01:38:49.840]   So the thing is that he provides some kind of backbone
[01:38:49.840 --> 01:38:50.920]   of that piece.
[01:38:50.920 --> 01:38:53.640]   But every single shot is being redone
[01:38:53.640 --> 01:38:55.400]   by a group of animators that--
[01:38:55.400 --> 01:38:57.520]   you know, he's definitely making it easier for them.
[01:38:57.520 --> 01:39:01.120]   But a lot of the shots are completely rebuilt
[01:39:01.120 --> 01:39:04.200]   that by the end of it, there's nothing left.
[01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:09.960]   And so it was animators were kind of up in arms about--
[01:39:09.960 --> 01:39:12.280]   because I think he was nominated for Golden Globes.
[01:39:12.280 --> 01:39:13.760]   I want to say Golden Globes.
[01:39:13.760 --> 01:39:17.200]   And the movie was nominated for visual effects, which
[01:39:17.200 --> 01:39:19.840]   is the animators award, isn't it?
[01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:21.320]   Yes.
[01:39:21.320 --> 01:39:22.320]   But they were just like--
[01:39:22.320 --> 01:39:23.360]   It's in there.
[01:39:23.360 --> 01:39:26.320]   So many of them that had worked on that film were just like, OK,
[01:39:26.320 --> 01:39:28.160]   so we worked on those shots.
[01:39:28.160 --> 01:39:28.760]   And--
[01:39:28.760 --> 01:39:31.520]   Yeah, why does Andy get the nod?
[01:39:31.520 --> 01:39:36.320]   I know someone who worked on Lord of the Rings.
[01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:39.000]   She was telling me about how the problem with anim--
[01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.120]   the motion capture was really, really great.
[01:39:41.120 --> 01:39:43.720]   But you get down to the fact that with a character like Gollum,
[01:39:43.720 --> 01:39:47.600]   Gollum doesn't have Andy Serca's style muscular legs
[01:39:47.600 --> 01:39:48.640]   and actual physique.
[01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:50.640]   So you have to change the motion capture
[01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:53.400]   to fit this guy who was essentially a crack addict
[01:39:53.400 --> 01:39:57.320]   with 2% body protein and 1% body fat.
[01:39:57.320 --> 01:40:01.280]   Did Brad hit get nominated for Benjamin Button, didn't he?
[01:40:01.280 --> 01:40:04.120]   Because that was all fake, too, right, wasn't it?
[01:40:04.120 --> 01:40:05.480]   A section of it was fake.
[01:40:05.480 --> 01:40:06.600]   I think the first half.
[01:40:06.600 --> 01:40:07.080]   Yeah.
[01:40:07.080 --> 01:40:08.000]   And then after that, it was--
[01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.200]   I guess there was some real acting in there.
[01:40:10.200 --> 01:40:13.080]   There's a great video on YouTube--
[01:40:13.080 --> 01:40:15.360]   that Weta released on how Andy--
[01:40:15.360 --> 01:40:17.160]   so if I can get it to run, I don't know why
[01:40:17.160 --> 01:40:18.520]   our YouTube is so slow in here.
[01:40:18.520 --> 01:40:21.160]   But that Andy shows how they did it.
[01:40:21.160 --> 01:40:23.160]   And this was with that new technique,
[01:40:23.160 --> 01:40:25.840]   where they have a camera on a stick.
[01:40:25.840 --> 01:40:26.920]   And so they were able to--
[01:40:26.920 --> 01:40:30.040]   yes, he's in a mock cap suit, but he's also getting--
[01:40:30.040 --> 01:40:31.760]   acting is captured in a camera.
[01:40:31.760 --> 01:40:33.400]   Which really makes a difference.
[01:40:33.400 --> 01:40:35.640]   So they have a 3D video with him going--
[01:40:35.640 --> 01:40:36.640]   Well, and here's the thing.
[01:40:36.640 --> 01:40:38.800]   The one thing I will say in the defense of nominating him
[01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:42.240]   is that I could see Gollum in the 8.
[01:40:42.240 --> 01:40:43.840]   You know, when I was watching "Plant of the Apes,"
[01:40:43.840 --> 01:40:45.240]   you could see expressions that felt like Gollum.
[01:40:45.240 --> 01:40:46.880]   Have you watched this making of ever?
[01:40:46.880 --> 01:40:50.880]   Because you will see how his expressions are literally
[01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:52.240]   transformed into the animation.
[01:40:52.240 --> 01:40:56.040]   It's quite a good-- I wish I could get it to play.
[01:40:56.040 --> 01:40:57.880]   Well, you can always go to YouTube and watch it.
[01:40:57.880 --> 01:41:01.520]   I think that's what YouTube wants us to tell you anyway.
[01:41:01.520 --> 01:41:04.480]   Just don't watch it on our show because they'll just pull it off,
[01:41:04.480 --> 01:41:06.040]   even though--
[01:41:06.040 --> 01:41:09.160]   anyway, he did not get the Oscar nod.
[01:41:09.160 --> 01:41:10.480]   But that's neither here nor there.
[01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:11.880]   But I think a good conversation.
[01:41:11.880 --> 01:41:13.000]   Thank you for--
[01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.120]   Turning in tech.
[01:41:15.120 --> 01:41:17.880]   Who wants to do-- I don't know, an iOS tip.
[01:41:17.880 --> 01:41:18.320]   OK, I got an iOS tip.
[01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:19.240]   Who's in the mood?
[01:41:19.240 --> 01:41:20.120]   I got an iOS tip.
[01:41:20.120 --> 01:41:21.080]   All right.
[01:41:21.080 --> 01:41:22.240]   So this is actually-- Michael Schulz
[01:41:22.240 --> 01:41:23.960]   posted this on my Twitter feed last week,
[01:41:23.960 --> 01:41:27.720]   but then someone else did the pick.
[01:41:27.720 --> 01:41:29.320]   And I didn't know this.
[01:41:29.320 --> 01:41:30.400]   There was a complaint that I had.
[01:41:30.400 --> 01:41:33.440]   And I know I'm going to sound stupid now.
[01:41:33.440 --> 01:41:41.000]   You want to find a word on the page in Safari on your iPad
[01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:42.640]   or iPhone.
[01:41:42.640 --> 01:41:47.000]   So you type it into where you would normally
[01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:50.040]  -- where you'd normally Google something or search Google.
[01:41:50.040 --> 01:41:53.040]   And I don't know why, but it just sits right over the keyboard.
[01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:53.960]   And so you don't notice it.
[01:41:53.960 --> 01:41:55.680]   But at the very bottom of that list,
[01:41:55.680 --> 01:41:58.240]   it says on this page 31 matches.
[01:41:58.240 --> 01:42:00.680]   And if you click on that, what you're going to get--
[01:42:00.680 --> 01:42:03.800]   I think there we go-- is you're going to get--
[01:42:03.800 --> 01:42:04.360]   Where is that?
[01:42:04.360 --> 01:42:05.440]   I never said that.
[01:42:05.440 --> 01:42:06.440]   Yeah.
[01:42:06.440 --> 01:42:08.400]   So that's what I was saying.
[01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:10.080]   So right at the-- when you type something in,
[01:42:10.080 --> 01:42:12.680]   you'll see the Google-- and then right at the very bottom.
[01:42:12.680 --> 01:42:13.760]   It says on this page--
[01:42:13.760 --> 01:42:14.760]   I don't know when it's happened.
[01:42:14.760 --> 01:42:15.240]   I spit you--
[01:42:15.240 --> 01:42:15.240]   I spit you--
[01:42:15.240 --> 01:42:16.480]   It's been there forever.
[01:42:16.480 --> 01:42:18.720]   And we're just-- so anyway, I felt--
[01:42:18.720 --> 01:42:20.560]   Michael Schulz sent it to me a couple of people,
[01:42:20.560 --> 01:42:21.800]   but he was the first one.
[01:42:21.800 --> 01:42:26.760]   And I was kind of-- yeah, I felt silly.
[01:42:26.760 --> 01:42:29.400]   So basically, you hit profile.
[01:42:29.400 --> 01:42:34.320]   And what it's going to do is it's easier if you just kind of
[01:42:34.320 --> 01:42:41.440]   drag down the Google list so you get rid of the keyboard.
[01:42:41.440 --> 01:42:45.480]   But then if you click on this page, 31 matches,
[01:42:45.480 --> 01:42:47.120]   you can pull this up here like this,
[01:42:47.120 --> 01:42:48.480]   and you can go and you can climb it down.
[01:42:48.480 --> 01:42:49.960]   So if you did a Google search for something,
[01:42:49.960 --> 01:42:51.600]   but you really wanted the text in the page--
[01:42:51.600 --> 01:42:52.100]   Right.
[01:42:52.100 --> 01:42:52.960]   So you just type it in there.
[01:42:52.960 --> 01:42:54.520]   But now I can just hit the forward buttons,
[01:42:54.520 --> 01:42:57.440]   and it'll jump to every time that profile in this page.
[01:42:57.440 --> 01:43:03.160]   So it's a tool that we use a lot in Safari or Chrome
[01:43:03.160 --> 01:43:04.320]   or whatever you're using.
[01:43:04.320 --> 01:43:06.880]   It's just that I couldn't figure out how to do it in my iPhone.
[01:43:06.880 --> 01:43:07.960]   And that's how you do it.
[01:43:07.960 --> 01:43:09.480]   So you just go ahead and do a search.
[01:43:09.480 --> 01:43:10.680]   And then at the bottom, you'll see that.
[01:43:10.680 --> 01:43:11.920]   It's easier to drag that right away.
[01:43:11.920 --> 01:43:13.560]   It's so subtle that's on this page thing.
[01:43:13.560 --> 01:43:13.720]   Yeah.
[01:43:13.720 --> 01:43:14.760]   And we did actually--
[01:43:14.760 --> 01:43:17.640]   we had this as a DUT tip on iPad.
[01:43:17.640 --> 01:43:18.400]   You may not have noticed.
[01:43:18.400 --> 01:43:19.960]   But once you pull up the keyboard,
[01:43:19.960 --> 01:43:22.560]   there's also a find and page search
[01:43:22.560 --> 01:43:24.440]   above the keyboard that does the same thing.
[01:43:24.440 --> 01:43:26.360]   So thank you.
[01:43:26.360 --> 01:43:28.680]   This was something-- this is a long-term complaint
[01:43:28.680 --> 01:43:31.600]   that we didn't have find and page in Safari on iOS.
[01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:34.720]   You do now, twice.
[01:43:34.720 --> 01:43:37.480]   How about a lion tip, anybody?
[01:43:37.480 --> 01:43:41.680]   This is-- I believe it's a general Mac OS tip.
[01:43:41.680 --> 01:43:44.800]   How many times do you try to resource a piece of text
[01:43:44.800 --> 01:43:46.560]   you got from the web or you got from one document
[01:43:46.560 --> 01:43:48.040]   into an email or something like that?
[01:43:48.040 --> 01:43:50.120]   And suddenly, just the other day,
[01:43:50.120 --> 01:43:52.240]   I was trying to share with somebody
[01:43:52.240 --> 01:43:53.440]   what my flight number is going to be,
[01:43:53.440 --> 01:43:55.440]   what time I expected to land in San Francisco.
[01:43:55.440 --> 01:44:01.040]   Then suddenly, dang it, it's like italicized, oblique, blue,
[01:44:01.040 --> 01:44:04.040]   and no, not only that in the mail form,
[01:44:04.040 --> 01:44:05.640]   but also now the next thing I type
[01:44:05.640 --> 01:44:07.680]   is going to be italicized blue, and no,
[01:44:07.680 --> 01:44:10.200]   but you know that if you go to the app,
[01:44:10.200 --> 01:44:12.880]   many of there is paste and match style, which means please
[01:44:12.880 --> 01:44:15.800]   ignore all formatting information with the text
[01:44:15.800 --> 01:44:18.800]   on the clipboard and just use whatever text formatting
[01:44:18.800 --> 01:44:20.120]   is already being used.
[01:44:20.120 --> 01:44:22.000]   There's actually a shortcut for that that, believe it or not,
[01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:25.800]   I only motivated myself to look up last week.
[01:44:25.800 --> 01:44:31.360]   Command-V is paste if you do study on a command option,
[01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:33.760]   Shift-V.
[01:44:33.760 --> 01:44:36.880]   So you have to hold down the command key and the option key
[01:44:36.880 --> 01:44:40.080]   with your thumb while you hold down the Shift key
[01:44:40.080 --> 01:44:41.240]   and then type V.
[01:44:41.240 --> 01:44:41.760]   Wow.
[01:44:41.760 --> 01:44:43.520]   Then it will do a paste and match style.
[01:44:43.520 --> 01:44:46.680]   Yeah, I use that all the time and it frustrates me.
[01:44:46.680 --> 01:44:48.680]   There's a few apps that don't support that.
[01:44:48.680 --> 01:44:52.600]   And it's becoming more and more prevalent as apps support
[01:44:52.600 --> 01:44:54.640]   cutting and pasting HTML natively.
[01:44:54.640 --> 01:44:56.240]   Very often, I don't want the HTML.
[01:44:56.240 --> 01:44:57.560]   I just want the text.
[01:44:57.560 --> 01:44:58.520]   Right.
[01:44:58.520 --> 01:45:02.120]   Yeah, that's actually a bug in iBooks Author right now,
[01:45:02.120 --> 01:45:03.840]   as it doesn't paste and match style.
[01:45:03.840 --> 01:45:04.600]   It doesn't do it?
[01:45:04.600 --> 01:45:06.040]   No, it has it in the menu.
[01:45:06.040 --> 01:45:06.600]   It's not working.
[01:45:06.600 --> 01:45:07.840]   It's buggy.
[01:45:07.840 --> 01:45:09.880]   But yeah, I use that probably a couple times a day
[01:45:09.880 --> 01:45:11.440]   when I'm posting, pasting something
[01:45:11.440 --> 01:45:13.760]   that I'm trying to do another document that's
[01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:15.880]   supposed to look nice.
[01:45:15.880 --> 01:45:18.040]   All right, time for your picks, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:45:18.040 --> 01:45:20.360]   Adam, do you have a pick that you could share?
[01:45:20.360 --> 01:45:22.520]   Yes, I do have a great pick.
[01:45:22.520 --> 01:45:25.960]   And it's not directly related to the iBooks thing,
[01:45:25.960 --> 01:45:27.240]   but it looks pretty much like iBooks.
[01:45:27.240 --> 01:45:29.840]   And it's a note-taking application.
[01:45:29.840 --> 01:45:33.400]   And I've used a lot of different note-taking applications.
[01:45:33.400 --> 01:45:35.960]   What I like about this one is it brings together
[01:45:35.960 --> 01:45:38.080]   a bunch of features that are in a bunch of different ones.
[01:45:38.080 --> 01:45:39.280]   And so it's called Note Shelf.
[01:45:39.280 --> 01:45:41.840]   I think it's $4.99 on the App Store.
[01:45:41.840 --> 01:45:44.080]   It allows you to set up little notebooks.
[01:45:44.080 --> 01:45:47.440]   And what's nice is you can pick a color or cover style.
[01:45:47.440 --> 01:45:49.560]   You can pick different types of papers.
[01:45:49.560 --> 01:45:51.960]   They have business papers and additional papers
[01:45:51.960 --> 01:45:52.640]   that you can download.
[01:45:52.640 --> 01:45:53.680]   They also have an app purchase.
[01:45:53.680 --> 01:45:55.960]   So you can buy new covers and things like that.
[01:45:55.960 --> 01:45:58.440]   But it comes with a wide variety of those.
[01:45:58.440 --> 01:46:00.360]   And then you get a little shelf metaphor that
[01:46:00.360 --> 01:46:01.280]   looks like iBooks.
[01:46:01.280 --> 01:46:05.960]   And you can group your notebooks into little categories
[01:46:05.960 --> 01:46:06.920]   on your shelf.
[01:46:06.920 --> 01:46:09.080]   And then just within the app itself,
[01:46:09.080 --> 01:46:10.680]   the kind of key features for me,
[01:46:10.680 --> 01:46:12.280]   it's more about handwriting.
[01:46:12.280 --> 01:46:14.600]   So I've played around with great apps like Penultimate
[01:46:14.600 --> 01:46:17.520]   and some of these for taking handwritten notes.
[01:46:17.520 --> 01:46:20.880]   But with a stylus, when you're taking handwritten notes,
[01:46:20.880 --> 01:46:25.640]   it has that zoom in feature where you can turn on the magnifier
[01:46:25.640 --> 01:46:28.360]   to find the section of the page and then write down
[01:46:28.360 --> 01:46:29.720]   at the bottom really big.
[01:46:29.720 --> 01:46:32.200]   But then it translates your writing
[01:46:32.200 --> 01:46:35.440]   into what it would be a normal sized handwriting thing.
[01:46:35.440 --> 01:46:38.520]   This is so hard sometimes on the iPad to write really small.
[01:46:38.520 --> 01:46:40.240]   So now you just write in this area at the bottom.
[01:46:40.240 --> 01:46:43.560]   And then the other feature that's built in that some other apps
[01:46:43.560 --> 01:46:46.440]   have had that I really like is it has handwriting protection.
[01:46:46.440 --> 01:46:50.400]   So you can actually set your wrist on the iPad in a defined area.
[01:46:50.400 --> 01:46:53.920]   And you can adjust the size of that area and actually write on it.
[01:46:53.920 --> 01:46:56.360]   And if you're writing in the full mode--
[01:46:56.360 --> 01:46:58.320]   so say you're in portrait mode and you're writing--
[01:46:58.320 --> 01:47:01.640]   it'll actually move down automatically.
[01:47:01.640 --> 01:47:04.560]   Your wrist protection as you move your hand down the page
[01:47:04.560 --> 01:47:05.480]   and you're writing.
[01:47:05.480 --> 01:47:07.080]   So it has all that.
[01:47:07.080 --> 01:47:08.960]   And then on top of that, it has the ability
[01:47:08.960 --> 01:47:11.480]   to reorganize your notes, move your paisers around.
[01:47:11.480 --> 01:47:15.600]   They just added Evernote and Dropbox support for syncing.
[01:47:15.600 --> 01:47:19.560]   You can write out to PDFs right into Dropbox.
[01:47:19.560 --> 01:47:20.600]   And just goes on and on.
[01:47:20.600 --> 01:47:25.040]   And I started to take all of my notes on the iPad
[01:47:25.040 --> 01:47:27.080]   by handwritten notes in this app.
[01:47:27.080 --> 01:47:29.040]   So for a long time, I've been recommending Dan
[01:47:29.040 --> 01:47:31.560]   Brichlin's Note app because it had the handwriting.
[01:47:31.560 --> 01:47:33.120]   It did also have the zoom.
[01:47:33.120 --> 01:47:35.600]   But it's always been kind of a little clunky in the--
[01:47:35.600 --> 01:47:36.600]   now this doesn't do--
[01:47:36.600 --> 01:47:38.040]   Oh, so put your handwriting--
[01:47:38.040 --> 01:47:39.120]   I'm just saying.
[01:47:39.120 --> 01:47:40.120]   So you're going to--
[01:47:40.120 --> 01:47:40.640]   You're going to--
[01:47:40.640 --> 01:47:41.720]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:47:41.720 --> 01:47:42.880]   And you can also type in it.
[01:47:42.880 --> 01:47:46.000]   And you can also put in photos and do a bunch of other things.
[01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:49.040]   But I found it really useful for just keeping all of my notes
[01:47:49.040 --> 01:47:50.360]   organized on my iPad.
[01:47:50.360 --> 01:47:54.040]   And now that for a long time, they didn't have the Dropbox
[01:47:54.040 --> 01:47:56.280]   and Evernote support that was recently added.
[01:47:56.280 --> 01:47:57.200]   And that's huge.
[01:47:57.200 --> 01:47:58.080]   And that's huge over the top for me.
[01:47:58.080 --> 01:48:00.120]   Yeah, because with Evernote, that means it's everywhere.
[01:48:00.120 --> 01:48:02.480]   I could take a note and then I can export them to Evernote
[01:48:02.480 --> 01:48:03.400]   and I have them everywhere.
[01:48:03.400 --> 01:48:04.280]   And it's just beautiful.
[01:48:04.280 --> 01:48:05.480]   I mean, it's a really beautiful app.
[01:48:05.480 --> 01:48:08.160]   They've got great covers and all the different types of papers,
[01:48:08.160 --> 01:48:08.680]   too.
[01:48:08.680 --> 01:48:10.520]   If you want graph paper, if you want,
[01:48:10.520 --> 01:48:13.240]   organize our papers, they have a bunch of different categories.
[01:48:13.240 --> 01:48:15.760]   So you use a stylus, huh?
[01:48:15.760 --> 01:48:19.240]   Yeah, I use the Pogo Sketch Plus or Pro.
[01:48:19.240 --> 01:48:21.360]   The one that looks like a paintbrush.
[01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:22.640]   It's kind of tapered on the end.
[01:48:22.640 --> 01:48:24.680]   It's got a nice little rubber tip.
[01:48:24.680 --> 01:48:26.680]   Yeah, the rubber tip.
[01:48:26.680 --> 01:48:28.840]   We saw them at CES.
[01:48:28.840 --> 01:48:31.360]   Said how much ever-- you were the guy who introduced me to them.
[01:48:31.360 --> 01:48:32.280]   Yes.
[01:48:32.280 --> 01:48:33.880]   How much we like them, Alex Lindsey.
[01:48:33.880 --> 01:48:34.560]   Thank you, Adam.
[01:48:34.560 --> 01:48:35.760]   Alex, your tip.
[01:48:35.760 --> 01:48:37.040]   I mean, the pick.
[01:48:37.040 --> 01:48:39.160]   I have to pick the, you know, my book's author.
[01:48:39.160 --> 01:48:40.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:48:40.160 --> 01:48:41.360]   I'll be sent to you.
[01:48:41.360 --> 01:48:42.920]   I won't go to do it, but I have to do it.
[01:48:42.920 --> 01:48:43.400]   Yeah.
[01:48:43.400 --> 01:48:43.920]   Because it's awesome.
[01:48:43.920 --> 01:48:44.920]   It's made it a big deal.
[01:48:44.920 --> 01:48:46.760]   It's, you know, I think it's a revolutionary app.
[01:48:46.760 --> 01:48:48.360]   And whether it becomes the thing that leads it
[01:48:48.360 --> 01:48:50.520]   or it just becomes the thing that sparks it, you know,
[01:48:50.520 --> 01:48:55.560]   sparks this revolution, I think that it's exciting to finally
[01:48:55.560 --> 01:48:56.920]   push this forward.
[01:48:56.920 --> 01:48:59.160]   And I admit that I've been impatiently waiting
[01:48:59.160 --> 01:49:00.320]   for this for a long time.
[01:49:00.320 --> 01:49:01.520]   And I don't think it's the end.
[01:49:01.520 --> 01:49:04.960]   I think 1.5 version 2.0 is going to get a lot more interesting.
[01:49:04.960 --> 01:49:07.480]   I think that there's a lot that I'm sure that they know
[01:49:07.480 --> 01:49:08.640]   needs to be added.
[01:49:08.640 --> 01:49:12.520]   But anyway, it's a very, very, very exciting app.
[01:49:12.520 --> 01:49:15.560]   And if you're trying to figure out what to do with yourself,
[01:49:15.560 --> 01:49:16.920]   I would highly suggest downloading it.
[01:49:16.920 --> 01:49:17.960]   Because I think that there is going
[01:49:17.960 --> 01:49:20.720]   to be a pretty strong demand for people who can put this
[01:49:20.720 --> 01:49:22.160]   together, not just for textbooks.
[01:49:22.160 --> 01:49:23.120]   Don't think of it that way.
[01:49:23.120 --> 01:49:24.080]   Think of it as PR.
[01:49:24.080 --> 01:49:25.520]   Think of it as training.
[01:49:25.520 --> 01:49:26.720]   Think of it as manuals.
[01:49:26.720 --> 01:49:29.440]   Think of it as, you know, all those other things.
[01:49:29.440 --> 01:49:31.120]   So it's nifty.
[01:49:31.120 --> 01:49:32.240]   Cool.
[01:49:32.240 --> 01:49:35.600]   And finally, Andy and Naco, your pick of the week.
[01:49:35.600 --> 01:49:39.000]   Mine is a really cool VNC-like service
[01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:40.720]   that was released just a couple weeks ago called
[01:49:40.720 --> 01:49:42.760]   online desktop.
[01:49:42.760 --> 01:49:45.440]   A lot of people are familiar with VNC.
[01:49:45.440 --> 01:49:48.360]   It's that basic technology that allows
[01:49:48.360 --> 01:49:51.840]   you to do remote desktop from basically Mac or Windows
[01:49:51.840 --> 01:49:55.000]   to pretty much anything that supports VNC client.
[01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.520]   There are VNC clients for iOS.
[01:49:57.520 --> 01:49:58.800]   The difficulty is that, of course, you
[01:49:58.800 --> 01:50:03.000]   have to keep a Mac or a PC somewhere in your office that
[01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:06.040]   has the right sort of holes in your firewall
[01:50:06.040 --> 01:50:08.280]   to allow you to actually access it.
[01:50:08.280 --> 01:50:10.880]   What online desktop is, it's simply
[01:50:10.880 --> 01:50:14.760]   a virtualized cloud Windows 7 installation
[01:50:14.760 --> 01:50:18.760]   that you can then simply access from an iOS app that they
[01:50:18.760 --> 01:50:19.680]   give you.
[01:50:19.680 --> 01:50:23.120]   And not only-- I've got it on the screen behind me--
[01:50:23.120 --> 01:50:26.040]   not only is it the standard Windows 7,
[01:50:26.040 --> 01:50:30.680]   but also you get a license for Microsoft Office.
[01:50:30.680 --> 01:50:31.600]   Isn't that amazing?
[01:50:31.600 --> 01:50:33.120]   It's the full office.
[01:50:33.120 --> 01:50:34.440]   And it's the full Microsoft Office.
[01:50:34.440 --> 01:50:37.240]   And it will give you a virtual keyboard that's different.
[01:50:37.240 --> 01:50:42.480]   The touch-enabled version of Windows 7 and Microsoft Office.
[01:50:42.480 --> 01:50:45.800]   So it's actually quite functional for what it does.
[01:50:45.800 --> 01:50:48.400]   But it will also-- you can dismiss the keyboard.
[01:50:48.400 --> 01:50:51.200]   And you can also use it with the regular Bluetooth
[01:50:51.200 --> 01:50:53.880]   keyboard that you've got hooked up to your iPad.
[01:50:53.880 --> 01:50:56.800]   And it's actually fast enough to--
[01:50:56.800 --> 01:50:57.880]   there are two things I like about it.
[01:50:57.880 --> 01:51:01.240]   Number one, it's fast enough that you can really actually
[01:51:01.240 --> 01:51:02.320]   type with this.
[01:51:02.320 --> 01:51:03.960]   So it solves a problem that I had when
[01:51:03.960 --> 01:51:06.600]   I was writing a bunch of books last year, which
[01:51:06.600 --> 01:51:08.040]   is there was a part of the project
[01:51:08.040 --> 01:51:12.440]   where I could keep the entire project in pages, the pages
[01:51:12.440 --> 01:51:14.760]   app, and work on it on my iPad, then come back,
[01:51:14.760 --> 01:51:16.840]   and then keep working on it on my desktop.
[01:51:16.840 --> 01:51:19.240]   There comes a point at which you have to share it with people.
[01:51:19.240 --> 01:51:21.520]   And then Microsoft, where it is, the lingua franca
[01:51:21.520 --> 01:51:23.240]   for collaborative work.
[01:51:23.240 --> 01:51:25.960]   So in order to see people's notes and people's comments
[01:51:25.960 --> 01:51:28.800]   in the work log, I'd have to then switch to Microsoft words.
[01:51:28.800 --> 01:51:31.080]   So at that point, now I have to really do everything.
[01:51:31.080 --> 01:51:33.480]   I have to travel with my MacBook Pro wherever I go.
[01:51:33.480 --> 01:51:35.600]   With something like this, it's at least credible.
[01:51:35.600 --> 01:51:38.440]   If you don't have serious heavy duty
[01:51:38.440 --> 01:51:40.280]   need for Microsoft Office, you just
[01:51:40.280 --> 01:51:42.800]   want to be able to write, edit, do some--
[01:51:42.800 --> 01:51:44.960]   you don't need to lay out a 500-page document in it.
[01:51:44.960 --> 01:51:47.600]   This is actually quite, quite credible for what it is.
[01:51:47.600 --> 01:51:50.680]   And the second thing is that it's actually--
[01:51:50.680 --> 01:51:54.480]   and this is more-- this is praise for this software,
[01:51:54.480 --> 01:51:56.720]   but it's also sort of a slap against Apple.
[01:51:56.720 --> 01:52:00.120]   It works just as well as iCloud does
[01:52:00.120 --> 01:52:04.080]   for sharing documents between your desktop and your iOS
[01:52:04.080 --> 01:52:09.880]   device, because as you can see here,
[01:52:09.880 --> 01:52:13.840]   this really is regular Microsoft Windows.
[01:52:13.840 --> 01:52:15.400]   And so you can pretty much do anything
[01:52:15.400 --> 01:52:18.000]   that you want to do in Windows with this.
[01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.960]   And it gives you two gigabytes worth of storage space
[01:52:20.960 --> 01:52:22.600]   for your office documents.
[01:52:22.600 --> 01:52:24.320]   But when it comes time, when you get home
[01:52:24.320 --> 01:52:26.560]   and you actually want to take the work that you actually
[01:52:26.560 --> 01:52:29.160]   did in your virtualized Windows 7 space
[01:52:29.160 --> 01:52:35.040]   and use it on your desktop, you simply go to the online.com
[01:52:35.040 --> 01:52:35.760]   website.
[01:52:35.760 --> 01:52:39.760]   And you see a very functional iCloud-ish sort of list.
[01:52:39.760 --> 01:52:42.280]   If here are all the documents you have inside your Windows 7
[01:52:42.280 --> 01:52:44.840]   cloud storage, you can download whatever you want.
[01:52:44.840 --> 01:52:47.440]   You can upload files from your desktop into the space,
[01:52:47.440 --> 01:52:49.360]   exactly the same way you have to do it
[01:52:49.360 --> 01:52:51.760]   if you're using documents in the cloud
[01:52:51.760 --> 01:52:53.840]   and sharing documents between your desktop
[01:52:53.840 --> 01:52:55.360]   and your mobile device.
[01:52:55.360 --> 01:52:57.240]   So it's a really, really nice solution.
[01:52:57.240 --> 01:52:57.880]   Not perfect.
[01:52:57.880 --> 01:52:59.680]   It really is like VNC.
[01:52:59.680 --> 01:53:02.560]   It's not like you're running a native operating system.
[01:53:02.560 --> 01:53:04.800]   But it's a nice little solution for a whole bunch
[01:53:04.800 --> 01:53:07.080]   of different problems that would ordinarily force you
[01:53:07.080 --> 01:53:09.520]   to carry a real laptop wherever you go.
[01:53:09.520 --> 01:53:11.960]   The other cool thing is that it is free.
[01:53:11.960 --> 01:53:14.280]   If you go to online.com and sign up for an account,
[01:53:14.280 --> 01:53:17.080]   they will give you a free 2 gigabyte space.
[01:53:17.080 --> 01:53:19.880]   They are-- it is a brand new service
[01:53:19.880 --> 01:53:22.160]   so that they're just starting to let people in.
[01:53:22.160 --> 01:53:23.640]   So chances are likely that you're
[01:53:23.640 --> 01:53:25.520]   going to be just adding your name to a list.
[01:53:25.520 --> 01:53:28.320]   You'll be informed when they're ready to start expanding it
[01:53:28.320 --> 01:53:29.240]   even more.
[01:53:29.240 --> 01:53:32.800]   They're hoping that if you start to like it
[01:53:32.800 --> 01:53:35.400]   in the near future, they'll offer a paid service,
[01:53:35.400 --> 01:53:38.400]   where I think for $20 a month, you get 50 gigabytes
[01:53:38.400 --> 01:53:39.400]   worth of storage.
[01:53:39.400 --> 01:53:43.240]   Plus, they give you priority access to the service.
[01:53:43.240 --> 01:53:45.480]   The limitation of this app is exactly--
[01:53:45.480 --> 01:53:47.720]   this free app is exactly the same as limitations
[01:53:47.720 --> 01:53:49.200]   of really any VNC.
[01:53:49.200 --> 01:53:51.600]   It sort of requires you to have a good connection
[01:53:51.600 --> 01:53:52.760]   to the internet.
[01:53:52.760 --> 01:53:55.960]   So in my house, like in a home or office internet,
[01:53:55.960 --> 01:53:57.080]   it works just fine.
[01:53:57.080 --> 01:53:59.560]   If you're at like a Wi-Fi cafe somewhere
[01:53:59.560 --> 01:54:01.680]   where they're considered-- when there are 30 people all
[01:54:01.680 --> 01:54:04.040]   working on their great American novels at the same time,
[01:54:04.040 --> 01:54:06.880]   you might have some stutters and blurps with it.
[01:54:06.880 --> 01:54:09.200]   Supposedly, when they have this paid access,
[01:54:09.200 --> 01:54:11.640]   they will give you sort of higher priority access
[01:54:11.640 --> 01:54:13.720]   to higher speed services so that, at least
[01:54:13.720 --> 01:54:15.840]   on the on-live side of things, if there's
[01:54:15.840 --> 01:54:17.600]   lots and lots of demand on the service,
[01:54:17.600 --> 01:54:19.640]   the people who are using the service for free
[01:54:19.640 --> 01:54:22.120]   won't degrade your performance if you've given them
[01:54:22.120 --> 01:54:24.440]   $20 a month for it.
[01:54:24.440 --> 01:54:26.320]   This is-- on live was originally a gaming system.
[01:54:26.320 --> 01:54:27.280]   We talked to them.
[01:54:27.280 --> 01:54:28.600]   Yeah, and it's so cool.
[01:54:28.600 --> 01:54:31.720]   They actually pay-- I asked them, is this a licensed copy
[01:54:31.720 --> 01:54:33.000]   of Microsoft Office?
[01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.520]   They said, yeah, we pay the license fee.
[01:54:35.520 --> 01:54:36.160]   That's amazing.
[01:54:36.160 --> 01:54:38.040]   What, the 40 million seat license?
[01:54:38.040 --> 01:54:39.680]   Yeah, well, I think there is a limit.
[01:54:39.680 --> 01:54:42.200]   I think if a lot of people start using this,
[01:54:42.200 --> 01:54:46.120]   you may get the warning that too many people are using it.
[01:54:46.120 --> 01:54:48.920]   By the way, I'm playing Microsoft Garden Pond.
[01:54:48.920 --> 01:54:50.560]   And this is on virtualization.
[01:54:50.560 --> 01:54:53.040]   It actually plays really well.
[01:54:53.040 --> 01:54:54.920]   This is kind of a touchscreen game
[01:54:54.920 --> 01:54:59.960]   that Microsoft devised probably for Surface.
[01:54:59.960 --> 01:55:00.520]   Yeah.
[01:55:00.520 --> 01:55:03.800]   I think you can imagine Apple actually optimizing macOS 10
[01:55:03.800 --> 01:55:05.920]   so that for an extra $100 a year,
[01:55:05.920 --> 01:55:10.800]   you could run macOS 10 virtualized remotely off the iPad.
[01:55:10.800 --> 01:55:12.080]   That's pretty amazing.
[01:55:12.080 --> 01:55:12.960]   That would be pretty cool.
[01:55:12.960 --> 01:55:14.960]   On live, it's free right now.
[01:55:14.960 --> 01:55:16.720]   You do have to have an on live account.
[01:55:16.720 --> 01:55:17.920]   Yeah.
[01:55:17.920 --> 01:55:19.560]   We're out of time, but thank you so much.
[01:55:19.560 --> 01:55:20.800]   What a great conversation.
[01:55:20.800 --> 01:55:21.720]   A great discussion.
[01:55:21.720 --> 01:55:23.360]   Absolutely.
[01:55:23.360 --> 01:55:24.720]   All is all right now.
[01:55:24.720 --> 01:55:25.880]   Yeah, you know this.
[01:55:25.880 --> 01:55:26.880]   We love to argue.
[01:55:26.880 --> 01:55:29.520]   So for all of you that are looking for controversy--
[01:55:29.520 --> 01:55:30.600]   No, no, no.
[01:55:30.600 --> 01:55:33.400]   It's good radio.
[01:55:33.400 --> 01:55:35.320]   Mac, Mac, and Daddy still love each other.
[01:55:35.320 --> 01:55:37.000]   Sometimes we simply have a discussion.
[01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:37.760]   Yes.
[01:55:37.760 --> 01:55:41.320]   Maccast.com for the best Macintosh podcast.
[01:55:41.320 --> 01:55:42.320]   Forget this one.
[01:55:42.320 --> 01:55:43.760]   Just listen to Adam.
[01:55:43.760 --> 01:55:44.760]   Just another one.
[01:55:44.760 --> 01:55:47.520]   It's for Mac Geeks by Mac Geeks.
[01:55:47.520 --> 01:55:48.440]   Maccast.com.
[01:55:48.440 --> 01:55:51.680]   And Adam will see you at Mac World Expo.
[01:55:51.680 --> 01:55:52.680]   It's exciting.
[01:55:52.680 --> 01:55:54.760]   Yeah, probably tomorrow or if tomorrow.
[01:55:54.760 --> 01:55:55.680]   Or if tomorrow's there.
[01:55:55.680 --> 01:55:56.680]   You bet.
[01:55:56.680 --> 01:55:58.320]   Alex Lindsey is at the Pixel Core,
[01:55:58.320 --> 01:56:00.240]   but if you really want to give him money
[01:56:00.240 --> 01:56:02.840]   to make an iBook for you, DV Garage.
[01:56:02.840 --> 01:56:03.960]   Is that where they should go?
[01:56:03.960 --> 01:56:05.560]   Well, that's where we're going to produce our own content.
[01:56:05.560 --> 01:56:07.320]   So our own content is going to come out of DV Garage.
[01:56:07.320 --> 01:56:08.560]   So we're making-- we're going to go back
[01:56:08.560 --> 01:56:10.600]   into the publishing business because we're now
[01:56:10.600 --> 01:56:11.760]   at the tool is here.
[01:56:11.760 --> 01:56:13.360]   The tool is there.
[01:56:13.360 --> 01:56:15.680]   And we will be--
[01:56:15.680 --> 01:56:18.200]   Pixel Core will still be doing some of the services
[01:56:18.200 --> 01:56:18.880]   at the beginning.
[01:56:18.880 --> 01:56:20.160]   It all ties together.
[01:56:20.160 --> 01:56:20.520]   I got you.
[01:56:20.520 --> 01:56:21.160]   Amazing way.
[01:56:21.160 --> 01:56:22.560]   We've been working on this for a long time.
[01:56:22.560 --> 01:56:23.560]   Yeah.
[01:56:23.560 --> 01:56:24.560]   Well, it's great to have you.
[01:56:24.560 --> 01:56:25.280]   Thanks for being here.
[01:56:25.280 --> 01:56:26.520]   Thank you.
[01:56:26.520 --> 01:56:28.320]   Andy, you about to get on a plane as well.
[01:56:28.320 --> 01:56:29.000]   Great to have you.
[01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.560]   I can't wait to see you in San Francisco.
[01:56:31.560 --> 01:56:33.880]   It will be exceptionally cool to see you guys again, too.
[01:56:33.880 --> 01:56:35.320]   Catch Andy on the Chicago Sun Times
[01:56:35.320 --> 01:56:39.480]   and his website, www.cwob.com.
[01:56:39.480 --> 01:56:40.480]   Thank you for joining us.
[01:56:40.480 --> 01:56:43.440]   We do this show every Tuesday, 11 AM Pacific, 2 PM Eastern
[01:56:43.440 --> 01:56:45.920]   time live at Twit.TV.
[01:56:45.920 --> 01:56:48.920]   And if you are of a mind to be in our live audience,
[01:56:48.920 --> 01:56:50.400]   I don't usually say this, but you can.
[01:56:50.400 --> 01:56:50.840]   It's open.
[01:56:50.840 --> 01:56:51.920]   The studio is open.
[01:56:51.920 --> 01:56:55.120]   We had people come inside a knock on the window.
[01:56:55.120 --> 01:56:57.600]   It'd be better not to do that.
[01:56:57.600 --> 01:57:01.440]   But instead to email my sister Eva, EVA at Twit.TV,
[01:57:01.440 --> 01:57:03.760]   then that's just so that you make sure that she knows you're
[01:57:03.760 --> 01:57:04.040]   coming.
[01:57:04.040 --> 01:57:07.720]   We'll set out seats and that I'm here and things like that.
[01:57:07.720 --> 01:57:09.120]   We don't have any cookies.
[01:57:09.120 --> 01:57:09.800]   We have cookies.
[01:57:09.800 --> 01:57:12.840]   And there's Alex's shoulder, for some reason that we don't.
[01:57:12.840 --> 01:57:14.280]   We don't know.
[01:57:14.280 --> 01:57:15.320]   We have cookies.
[01:57:15.320 --> 01:57:16.280]   Did you not get the cookies?
[01:57:16.280 --> 01:57:18.680]   There was a-- people brought a box of cookies on Saturday.
[01:57:18.680 --> 01:57:20.440]   For the audience, we need to bring out cookies.
[01:57:20.440 --> 01:57:21.640]   Oh, cookies for the audience.
[01:57:21.640 --> 01:57:23.600]   I thought they were supposed to bring cookies for us.
[01:57:23.600 --> 01:57:25.600]   Anyway, thank you all for being in the audience.
[01:57:25.600 --> 01:57:26.320]   We appreciate it.
[01:57:26.320 --> 01:57:27.760]   And we'll see you next time now, everybody.
[01:57:27.760 --> 01:57:31.040]   You get back to work or to Mac World Expo.
[01:57:31.040 --> 01:57:31.960]   Big time is over.
[01:57:31.960 --> 01:57:34.800]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:57:34.800 --> 01:57:38.160]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:57:38.160 --> 01:57:40.740]   (upbeat music)
