[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:06.480]   Joining us, he's back from Pokefest, which is not all about delicious
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.600]   bowls of Japanese food, but in fact, Pokemon Go. It's Mr. Renee Richie from iMorta.
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:36.480]   Now I want a sugary Pokefest. I'm in the blue room. Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.480]   are you at the Boston Public Library? No, I'm not. I'm actually like kind of near mood fabrics in
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:49.680]   the Garment District of New York City. I was at the Motorola launch event for like their new weirdo
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.840]   phone. Oh, and so I wanted to know more about that. Oh, maybe a little bit later if you like.
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.840]   Okay. Andy's tired because he spent the night on a train or something.
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.520]   No, no, it's just that I had to leave the house at like 5 a.m. to make my train to get to this
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:13.360]   thing on time. And I think listeners will have been in this position where it's like, okay,
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:20.400]   I can go to bed now and get two to three hours of sleep or I can stay up for two or three hours
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.680]   and absolutely not have to worry about oversleeping and missing my train and missing this event.
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.640]   I'm supposed to be out in New York City. I made the silly choice that got me to New York City.
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.040]   Well, I'm glad you got there and I can't wait to hear what you found out.
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.880]   I hear it's a very large city with buildings that reach to the sky.
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:46.400]   I've seen it as over 17 people Leo. I stopped counting at 30. Wow, wow, many just use the word
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:53.040]   many, many people. One and one no more than two. Also here from his studio in beautiful downtown
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:04:00.160]   Burbank. It's I don't know where Alex Lindsay. I just yeah, just Santa Fele.
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.080]   Santa Fele. It's Santa Fele. I know you're done used to calling it.
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.400]   Santa Fele. I just don't like Echo. Do you have? I know I love that. I don't like Echo either.
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.880]   And I'd like what you've done with the place. You know, it's not really my space until there's
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:19.520]   a whole lot of Sonics on the wall. I know it's got that fancy foam on the wall that that reduces.
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:23.520]   It does. He sounds like you're in a soundproof room. When I started when I started in radio,
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.000]   it was all carpet. It was like a playing am station. It's carpet.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.040]   But carpet on the walls. And then it was egg crates, but the key was not to get any egg crates
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:36.160]   that had been had a broken eggs on them. Not to mention that they're highly flammable.
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.840]   That we didn't think about that. We were just mostly thinking about Echo.
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.880]   That works as well. I might have to get some of this.
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:48.560]   Sonics is great. Yeah, I just they come in big things and you get the wrong ones. You order the
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.960]   wrong ones. You get these little one by ones. You're like, what am I supposed to do with this?
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.600]   We actually have some on the wall up here. Right. It's just a small patch up there.
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:04.560]   So we are gathered together to talk about Apple and the Macintosh and yes, the Rock did make a
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:11.120]   movie with Siri. Hey, Siri, we got to play this. We got to play this. Show me my life goals list.
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:16.000]   So remember last week, the Rock had just tweeted that he was doing the Rock versus Siri movie.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.720]   And we we were speculating, but it was obviously going to be an ad. But it's a long ad. It's
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.840]   not a is this hearing on television? Maybe a short version.
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.320]   I haven't seen it on television yet. It was dubbed a mini movie.
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:36.480]   It's three minutes and already more than six million views on YouTube in in less than two days.
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:44.320]   So they've got their money's worth. I think let's watch. This is a former professional wrestler,
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:50.720]   Dwayne Johnson. And apparently, if I click this link, nothing happens. Oh, that's because I'm on
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:56.640]   a Windows machine. Oh, yeah, you need the you the YouTube's is the problem that I
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:01.840]   I'm not it might not have HTTP streaming support. There we go.
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:07.440]   Okay, let's start over again. So I'm going to have to describe this for you watching at home.
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:14.160]   He's trimming his bonsai. This one's for earth. This one is for earth. Bingo.
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.920]   Boom. Love that one. Okay. What is he talking about? I just want we're going to we're going to
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:22.400]   be we don't know yet. That's going to come back to the end of the very one's for that.
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.000]   And then his little assistant is Santa is, you know, is sick of fanic assistance.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   By the way, while he's doing this, he is pumping iron with his right hand. He's got a cable machine
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   and somebody's shaving his head. This is all going on at the same time. Yeah, I felt good.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.920]   Hey, Siri, read my schedule. You have 25 appointments at 715.
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:46.240]   They're on the telly with so many projects in the works. It seems like Dwayne Johnson can't
[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.600]   possibly take on anymore. Well, that sounds like a challenge.
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:57.280]   So now he's headed out. Where are we going, buddy? Wayne, buddy. Hey, Siri, show me my life
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:01.760]   goals. Nice. I found 10 reminders. Thank you. My way. He doesn't even read them. He just,
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:08.480]   so that's a vadubius value. But okay. He's grabbed a leather jacket. He's apparently on a
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:12.960]   soundstage. Just grabbed a leather jacket from the rack as it goes by. He is now fully
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:18.640]   attired. He's rocked out. Siri, give me a lift ride to L.A.X.
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:22.720]   Lift can get you a lift in 60 seconds. I do like that. I didn't know you could do that.
[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:26.240]   I've never used Siri to get lift or Uber. That's Siri kit. It's what you can do.
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:30.160]   Ride hailing is one of the Siri kit features. So the lift driver drives up in the rock,
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:34.080]   peers in the window and says, "Might of our drive. I know a shortcut."
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:35.440]   You're... Yeah.
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:39.520]   The driver hops out, gets in the back seat.
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:46.640]   And the rock. Picture of young rock on the exit. The high temperature for today in Rome will be
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:57.600]   80 degrees and the low will be 59 degrees. Stop the airplane. So do I pay you? It's on me.
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:01.120]   This is your new captain speaking. Looks like we have nice weather coming up for Rome,
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:05.520]   Italy. So sit back, relax. The plane's going to Akron. This flight's going to Rome.
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:12.640]   The rock is now hijacked to flight and is painting the Sistine Seal in my last email.
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:16.560]   He's kind of floating in the air above the... Yeah, I think it's been restoration.
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:20.880]   Oh, is that it? His restoration. He would... Even he wouldn't presume to
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:25.520]   paint over Leonardo da Vinci's. Or who is it? Michelangelo's record. Michelangelo, yeah.
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:28.800]   Yeah, not that day. At 9.30 a.m. Viscum sent you an email about.
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:32.640]   Mr. Nakamura can discuss your fashion line. I'm out.
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:38.640]   Hey Siri, show me photos of my fashion line. You know Grazat, what do you think?
[00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:42.560]   It doesn't really matter what I think. What do you think? Oh, I think it's show time.
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:49.760]   Viscum Black and White. Everything in life is made up of four elements. Wind, fire,
[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:56.480]   fresh water, rock and wasion. Hey Siri, text Chef Ludo. I want to cook. Hey Siri, how many
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:03.440]   ounces in a centiliter? One centiliter is 0.34 fluid ounces.
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:09.040]   Messy. By the way, that was apparently Japanese for I smell what the rock is cooking.
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:11.920]   Siri, play my practice playlist.
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:20.480]   Let me explain it. Chinese instrument.
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:27.920]   In the do it. What a weird call that is from your manager. You're a master of this
[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:32.400]   organization instrument. So by the way, we want to be in a commercial where you're playing
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:38.320]   the instrument with the rock. Right, because she is probably an actual master. Right. She
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:41.840]   looked like she was fingering the instrument correctly. I don't know how much her country
[00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:44.560]   was doing. Let's see if she can get extremely well. Let's see if the rock is.
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:51.840]   Hey Siri, face. Oh, by the way, he's already posted a YouTube video. Should check in on that
[00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:58.400]   real quickly. It's called the King of Chinese shred, Dwayne Johnson tears up Gu Zhang.
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:08.240]   Hey Siri, say, wait a minute. I should have made note of. He's got 777 thumbs up, 59 thumbs down,
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:14.160]   and 11.3 million views, which actually this commercial is approaching already.
[00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:18.320]   What a bad idea to leave a negative comment on one of the rocks videos.
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:23.120]   Time called to Dwayne. You don't do that twice. What are you getting back to set? Everybody's
[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:27.200]   freaking out here. Now we just got the last shot. Don't worry. I'll be there. Okay. He's in space.
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:30.480]   I'm going to go get fired. Bye. Bye. Hey Siri, take a selfie.
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:35.200]   Do you seem to be wearing off Mercury or Gemini area?
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:38.400]   Are you serious? Do you hear his very funny role? If you say so,
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:43.440]   Apollo 8, EDA food. No, that doesn't look like an EDA food. It looks like an IN.
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:49.440]   Let's take that because I don't think that's a very linguistic use. Clearly, Captain Kirk knew
[00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:54.560]   the combination to his vault. It's making me a good helmet here. Apparently in the vacuum of
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:58.080]   space, but the suit is clearly on pressure, right? Look how easily he can make a fist. Megan said
[00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:02.720]   the best part of this commercial was she learned that Siri could do that. Hey Siri, take a selfie.
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:06.880]   It couldn't originally and we filed a radar. It would originally just turn on the normal camera.
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:10.320]   Oh, that's funny. We redart it and pointed it out and then it got fixed. I fixed it.
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:14.720]   Because they knew they had to do this ad. Open on cars and eclipse. I promise.
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:19.600]   That's a good line. I missed the first time through. This is one of those ads you have to watch
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:25.120]   over and over and over again. We'll be here. It's very punctual. Can I roll or do? If you say so.
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:29.200]   All right, let's roll film, please. So they're rolling the commercial without the rock because,
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:34.000]   well, you'll see. Time mechanical spider for all the Kevin Smith fans.
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:42.320]   There's the rock. There is the school home screen. Oh, was that the Wilhelm scream?
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:45.840]   Yeah, let's back up. Let's back up. I think it was.
[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:53.200]   Well, like I got back farther. Oh, that's hysterical. Only Alex Lindsey would pick that up
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.480]   and eight thousand redditors.
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:12:03.680]   That was a well scream for sure. For sure. Nice, nice catch, Alex Lindsey.
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:08.640]   We've added it to a lot of things. Google the Wilhelm scream, folks, if you want to know what
[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:16.320]   that is. There's a whole YouTube video. There it is. He emerges from the giant spider in the
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:23.600]   t-shirt and jeans he was wearing at the beginning of this commercial. This one's for earth. Oh,
[00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:28.400]   he was practicing his life. He's dead. That was amazing, man. Okay, of course you're okay.
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:33.440]   Coughton handle. Do you just seems crazy? This looks like a cost and love of money. So glad you're
[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:38.480]   back. Yes. We got a lot to do. Is this guy wearing a Darth Vader helmet back here? What's going on?
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:43.120]   Look at the shot of pit stains in the personal assistant up there. Oh, yeah. Well, he was very
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:48.480]   nervous. Very, very nervous. Yeah. Opportunity details like that. Yeah. This is they've really,
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:53.040]   they've really put the extra effort into this year. So you've got the the pit stains,
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:58.560]   you've got the Darth Vader helmet, the scissor lift, nowhere. What kind of camera? What is that?
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:06.240]   What is that here though? That looks like a jib there with... Is that the... I think that's a
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:14.400]   that's a remote control head for a remote control arm. Yeah. So it's like it's a big circular thing
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:21.120]   that basically lets you control the rotation of the camera as well as... By the way, no pits on the
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:27.280]   rock just on a point. Can I say that's one of my favorite kinds of like shots and TV movies,
[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:32.880]   anything when they have to rent super expensive camera and lighting equipment just to put on a set
[00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:38.800]   to make it look like a working movie set, even though they're not using it. Well, well done,
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:44.640]   my friends. Well done. Yeah. We do have a lot to do. Hey, Siri, create a new list. What should I call
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:50.640]   this list? Life goals. The sequel. Normally, I like sequels, but I think right now we need to push
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:56.960]   off on that and just keep you open for other projects. Hey, Siri, you're the best. Thanks.
[00:13:56.960 --> 00:14:06.800]   Mr. Big, Bald and Beautiful. I love you too. So he's named himself Mr. Big Bald and Beautiful. Wait,
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:12.880]   I gotta fix that. Hey, Siri. All three of those things is true.
[00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:29.120]   Call me Mr. Big Bald and Beautiful. Yes. There you go. Oh, I got bold. I'm not bald. That's okay.
[00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:36.320]   I like Big Bold and Beautiful. That's good. Siri, nice choice. All right. There you go. We have
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:44.160]   now deconstructed. We have smell a little loud. The rock is cooking. The rock dominate the day.
[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:48.800]   The rock versus Siri. I think Apple. Do you think Apple got their money? Okay. Budget. Alex
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:55.040]   Lindsey, what do you think? I give it three to four million. Three to four million million
[00:14:55.040 --> 00:15:02.560]   dollars a minute. Yeah, probably. Yeah. I mean, it's it's a lot of there's a lot of production value
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:06.800]   there. I mean, there's I mean, they maybe they got it done done for last, but when you look at the
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:10.400]   amount of special effects and you look at all the bits and pieces and you look at locations and
[00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:14.480]   process, they didn't do a lot of those on location. So they had to build that in a set and they had
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:20.400]   to, you know, there's a lot of there's a lot of sense in this and they had a car chase scene.
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:27.200]   I mean, yeah. Right. Now, I presume the Sistine ceiling is probably a green screen as opposed to
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:32.400]   actually building a replica Sistine ceiling. Wasn't told the location. I mean, but there's going to
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:36.480]   be some location there. I mean, that that's probably all a matte painting, other than what he's and
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:39.520]   he might have me touching anything on that wide shot. So that could be all green screen.
[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:43.520]   It's a pretty big matte. I don't know. It's not that it wouldn't be that hard to build. I mean,
[00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:46.880]   it mats aren't big. They're just whether they're detailed or not. I mean, they're just right. It's
[00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:50.960]   just the screen. Like here, you know, he could be just doing a little bit of something close up.
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:55.040]   I mean, you know, and have the rest of that behind him being pretty much where that curve is was
[00:15:55.040 --> 00:16:01.360]   probably where I would do it. He doesn't touch anything. I don't think. So theoretically,
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:04.960]   he could do it all on green screen. That would definitely it's still, you know, it's well done
[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:09.840]   effects, well done shots. You know, they're all things to be done. So I mean, I wouldn't be
[00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:13.360]   surprised if it was in the three or four million dollar range. There's an actual jumbo jet. I don't
[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:18.640]   I don't think that's fake. I don't know if there's any part of that that needed to be.
[00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:24.880]   Oh, those are real fences. This is all. But now you don't think that that's a real
[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:29.520]   a real air. Yeah, that might have been faked, huh? I think that they could have faked all of that.
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:34.880]   They probably shot the car turning, but most car commercials we see are all CG. I mean,
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:37.440]   they're almost no car commercial. Like when you see them driving through the roads, that's one
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:41.520]   thing. But when you see any of these kind of effects stuff, I mean, this is kind of a shut down
[00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:46.320]   LAX so he can drive a lift vehicle onto the runway. And you don't need to. I mean, that that
[00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:50.320]   that would easily. It's actually easier to do that and CG is that an air can.
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:53.200]   That's like they're a little worried now. Okay.
[00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:58.560]   That's a flat air acron. Air Akron. Oh, that's right. We're flying to Akron.
[00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:04.640]   But yeah, one photo or a or a or a background plate or a shot plate, you know, that would be
[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:08.640]   enough to do all that would that all actually looks now that we look at it again. It probably
[00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:12.800]   looks like it was a map. Yeah, you know what the plane the plane was moving the plane in the front.
[00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:16.240]   Yeah. Yeah, it's easy to move. I mean, if you've seen 405 the movie,
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:22.880]   I've seen four or five the movie. No, what's four or five? The movie was probably the original
[00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:30.960]   viral movie before start, maybe before YouTube existed. I do love that picture of the young
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:36.720]   around it. Yeah. With the kid in play. I hear dude. Classic.
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:44.080]   Turtle neck with a big necklace around the turtle neck. By the way, no, it's a date. Monday
[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:50.400]   July 24th. This is all happened yesterday. Amazing. It would have been funny. I think the
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:54.640]   funnier thing would have been to to the stuff he's doing on social media where he's posting it.
[00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:58.560]   It would have been funny if you posted it on Monday on Sunday, like things like like he was
[00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:03.120]   doing it was like he was actually doing it. What's going on? So part of like a social campaign,
[00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:08.240]   you see you see him actually doing all those things. And then the next day you see what how
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:12.960]   that actually all came together. I have to point out there aren't a whole lot of series screens in
[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:20.240]   here, maybe two or three. You hear series voice a lot, but not a lot of screens. I mean, I don't
[00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:24.560]   think the Apple does that well. It's not overdone. It's not how it's done. I'm going to put it in
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:27.920]   your face. Yeah. Right. All the time. All the time. Some of those CBS shows where they were showing
[00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:33.520]   off the windows phones were really, you know, living for long. I agree. Yeah. Let me pull out
[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:38.240]   a phone for absolutely no reason and show you a close up of me using it. And a cameo. I'm checking
[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:40.960]   contacts, right? Like it was like, I'm going to show you how to find my content. Oh, I know it's
[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:46.640]   ridiculous. Well, we're talking a little FaceTime cameo. That's nice. Yeah. Get that in there.
[00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:51.360]   Give a little plug for the orbit. The old system. Good reception in orbit. Yeah.
[00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:54.800]   Yeah. Actually probably the percentages quite good. It's line aside, isn't it? I mean,
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:19:00.320]   almost everything. And they did have to build. Did they build a giant spider? I think there's
[00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:04.480]   some practicals in there because he had to explode into it. You got to be able to rent a giant
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:12.560]   spider. That's got to be built somewhere. That's in somebody's catalog. A guy from what was that?
[00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:15.840]   Old Kevin Smith joke where they kept trying to force him to put a giant mechanical spider in a
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:19.680]   Superman. And then he finally dropped out and he went to watch Will Smith in Westworld and
[00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:23.360]   act three giant mechanical spider. So I'm sure it's just sitting in Lorenzo di Bonavittoral.
[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:27.920]   Well, and the other thing is with a lot of stuff, what makes those things expensive is how much
[00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:31.440]   they have to articulate. So if it doesn't have to articulate very much, it would actually not be.
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:35.840]   I mean, it'd be. She's built at a star of the hundred down. Yeah. Well, no, it can be built on
[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:40.160]   a metal. But it might cost you 50 or 100 miles. Well, you've done exactly that, right? You've
[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:44.320]   I've built some stuff, not that big, but definitely we've built a lot of that. Well, I'll
[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:49.680]   think of the dragon you built for a sword and laser, right? That was that was that was.
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:56.480]   That was I didn't build it myself. But but actually Martin who did build it. Martin was in my office.
[00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:59.680]   This one. So it's nice to see podcasts with big budgets.
[00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:04.800]   How do they shrink the rock down so small to get rid of all those miniature models?
[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:13.600]   Yeah, it's interesting. It holds up pretty well to the this is a lot of commercials wouldn't hold
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:16.480]   up to this frame by frame analysis. But it's hot.
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:18.720]   Doodle doodle do Johnson and look at doodle do.
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:23.680]   And the reality is, I mean, three to four million dollars for for a commercial high in commercial
[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:28.400]   is not really that big of a music video. Millionaire. How just to play it? Yeah, music video music
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:33.680]   video money circa 19, whatever 90 or whatever maybe but music video don't really get that kind
[00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:38.960]   of budget anymore. Right. Because then the music plus plus is really important to have a commercial
[00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:44.000]   like this because one of the difficulties of any sort of a voice assistant is that there are no
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:49.280]   menus or buttons you can just sort of like methodically go through every menu to find out what this
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:53.040]   app can do. It's like the number of times that someone has impressed me. Wait, wait, wait, what
[00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:57.360]   did you just say ask Siri to do? You can actually, Oh my God, I didn't know that.
[00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:01.360]   It's a great way to keep people on the other features that you can use. I mean, you're
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:06.880]   absolutely right that being able to have people say there's a there's probably three or four things
[00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:09.360]   in that video that I didn't even call it. Do that theory.
[00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:12.080]   Right. Turn on low power.
[00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:17.200]   Always freaks people out. Turn on low power mode. Yeah, there's nothing that there's nothing that
[00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:23.440]   he's doing in this commercial that is really fresh or revolutionary or says, my God, Siri is
[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:28.480]   amazing to anybody who's been using it for a couple of years. But again, it's like the number
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:34.480]   of people who use Siri to find out what the weather is, do simple math and turn on and turn
[00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:39.120]   off lights who have no idea what it can do. It's you need to have a magic show at some point.
[00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:43.440]   It's actually a good point because the rock. I mean, you're paying attention to the rock.
[00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:48.000]   The things he's asking Siri to do are very basic. People probably don't know.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.880]   But again, it's basic for someone who hasn't tried asking Siri to do things like that.
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:56.480]   Sort of like, Mark is to get people to use Siri is that all you have to do is remind them
[00:21:56.480 --> 00:22:02.160]   to say, because yeah, yeah, make it cool. And if the rock uses it, it must be cool.
[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:06.960]   Hey, let's take a break. We're gonna come back new Mac malware. It's been around for years and a
[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:17.040]   visit to Grant Park, Chicago, Illinois, 60601. But first a word from our sponsor PayPal.
[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:24.720]   Yeah, PayPal. You know, it's funny because when I first set up the podcast, we didn't have advertising.
[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:29.200]   We just took tips via PayPal. We still do a lot of people still subscribe to our shows
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:34.240]   a couple bucks a month via PayPal. And now we've got PayPal ads, which makes is full circle.
[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:39.360]   We've gone full circle. PayPal is doing something really cool. They're awarding three businesses.
[00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:42.960]   They really believe in the power of entrepreneurship. They're awarding three businesses.
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:50.000]   They think have major potential with 10 grand and a makeover for one of PayPal's partners.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.400]   You think you have what it takes? The future of your business can start here. I wish they'd done
[00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:59.280]   this ad 11 years ago. I would have, I would have applied. You can reach your full potential with
[00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:04.320]   $10,000 and a makeover. Here's your chance to earn some cash flow and take your business to the

[00:23:55.680 --> 00:24:04.880]   July 30th. And you find out more at paypal.com/macbreakpaypal.com/macbreak. We thank PayPal.
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:11.280]   For their support all these years, all these years. And by the way, I should also thank all the people
[00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:16.240]   who contribute. I probably shouldn't remind them. Who could treatment every month? A couple of
[00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:20.640]   by all I said was just a couple of bucks a month. That's all I ask. And people very generously
[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:26.080]   have helped support this network from day one with the PayPal subscriptions. Thank you.
[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:31.840]   It was a no brainer. Were you one of them? Yes. I was listening to Macbreak
[00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:36.240]   commuting home from work. And I said, I need more Leo in my life. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you.
[00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:42.640]   So there's a new virus in town except that apparently it's been affecting a small number of
[00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:50.720]   Macintosh computers for years. That was like purgware. It was, yeah, we call it rat. A rat.
[00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:58.240]   A remote access Trojan, right? The idea was it could take over a computer and watch you.
[00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:06.960]   They could capture passwords and take control of the mouse. You know, people have called me.
[00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:11.840]   I feel bad now because people have called me on the radio show for years saying I have a Mac
[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:19.440]   and somebody's watching me. And I almost always said, no, it's but maybe they weren't far off.
[00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:27.520]   Tell us about this. Was it firefly? It looks like I don't know too much about it, but it looks like
[00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:34.240]   it was recently discovered but is an older version of malware that would try to spy on people and
[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:38.720]   now we're going to call home. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And it would call home for the server. So they
[00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:43.600]   registered one of those servers to see what was happening and saw this sort of information. But
[00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:47.600]   it looked like it was very limited in scope because the person either only wanted specific
[00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:52.800]   things or didn't want to risk discovery. And it's unclear what sort of like, you know, all modern
[00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:58.000]   Macs, I believe, go through a secure enclave now for the camera. So it's very, very hard to get
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:03.280]   any form of access to it. But it's unclear when this started and it's been dormant apparently
[00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:08.080]   for a while to. So it was discovered by Patrick Wardle who's with the security firm, Synac.
[00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:15.920]   And it came to light, he said, in January after circulating for at least two years fruit fly.
[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:24.480]   It both malware samples capture screenshots, keystrokes, webcam images, information about the
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:30.400]   affected Mac. There's two generations of it. They also collect information of devices connected to
[00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:38.320]   the same network. Malware bytes discovered the variant one infecting four Macs. And apparently,
[00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:43.040]   Apple responded to that by updating Mac OS to, you know, when is that tool that they have that
[00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:49.120]   will delete malware automatically? I think on the name. Now there's another name, but it's a
[00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:54.160]   malware sort of detection system. You know, Apple's done a very, I think, a very good job of without
[00:26:54.160 --> 00:27:00.240]   even really making a big deal out of it protecting Mac users. Wardle's version, version two of
[00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:05.600]   fruit fly has infected a larger number of Macs. And as you say, he discovered that because
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:12.000]   after analyzing it, there he discovered that there were several backup domains
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:18.160]   that were command and control domains and they were hard coded into it. So the domains had not
[00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:22.720]   been registered. So he registered them. And he says, within two days of registering one of the
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:27.840]   addresses close to 400 infected Macs connected to the server, mostly from homes in the US.
[00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:34.480]   Now he didn't obviously take advantage of his access. He just he recorded the IP address and
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:41.920]   the user names. And I presume with the purpose of, you know, Apple contacting them or somehow
[00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:49.520]   fixing that infection. So and they don't know the mechanism for infection. As you say, Renee,
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:54.560]   it's kind of thought that perhaps it was created to spy on specific people and then abandoned by
[00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:59.840]   its creators. Yeah, I haven't seen much information on it yet. Yeah. Well, we'll find out more
[00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:06.320]   tomorrow because he's giving a presentation at Black Hat. Or was that last Wednesday? Is that
[00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:15.520]   no, that's tomorrow. Yeah. So offensive malware analysis, Patrick Wardle dissecting OS 10 fruit fly
[00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:21.200]   by a custom command and control server. But what's weird is it's been going on for a long time.
[00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:29.200]   The servers still work. People's have it on their system. Some small number of people have it.
[00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:35.120]   It's very strange because it is like usually we talk about thousands of people being in fact
[00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:44.560]   that not hundreds of the 56 AV products for Macintosh only 19 detected. And that's only because
[00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:51.360]   it was discovered. So we now know Max get viruses. That's a surprise to anybody.
[00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:54.240]   And that this weird one has been around for a while.
[00:28:54.240 --> 00:29:01.120]   Is there any concern? Cuz we're concerned. I mean, we saw it for a long time. It's an economic
[00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:04.720]   crime, right? Like you have to be worth your money to target Mac users. In this case, it sounds
[00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:08.960]   like it was a very specific intent. And he was willing to go to this trouble to do it. Right.
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:12.880]   He or she or whoever. Yeah. They also say it's written. It's written in Pearl.
[00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:19.920]   They think it's probably pretty old because nobody writes exploits in Pearl. Although at one time,
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:26.880]   it was a hack and language of choice. And so it could have been around for a very long time.
[00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:33.440]   Yeah. I mean, the thing is a lot of the stuff is really operational in nature. You're not trying
[00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:39.440]   to infect one out of every three computers on the planet and create a botnet. Sometimes it really
[00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:44.640]   is. We know that this installation that has data we're very, very interested in is predominantly a
[00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:50.480]   Mac shop. And so we really just want to infect people who are using this, the machines in this
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:56.560]   lab or in this office. So and you can make, you can roll out variants of common viruses for pretty
[00:29:56.560 --> 00:30:01.120]   much any operation that you want. So that's why you often find, excuse me, people have told me
[00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:05.760]   that you often find these sort of like siege machines, three quarters of the way built that
[00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:09.920]   they that the grass and the trees are now sort of slowly overtaking because they were built for one
[00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:14.400]   purpose, a war that never came. But there was no need to pull the infrastructure down. So it was
[00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:20.800]   just out there somewhere. Just sitting out there. Well, it's still can affect Yosemite or works on
[00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:26.080]   Yosemite. If you have it, go ahead. I'm sorry, Alex. Oh, no. And then sometimes pulling it down,
[00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:31.120]   we'll get you in more trouble. And you're exposing yourself as a hacker again to take the infrastructure
[00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:35.280]   out. So you're better off. And also given given these things are invisible, why would you want to
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:41.120]   pull it down? You never, it really is a every every time I talk to somebody about who really is a
[00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:45.760]   an expert on this kind of security. It's never about the one person who has the magic key that
[00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:51.840]   unlocks everything. It's these people who are just throwing medium size rocks constantly at
[00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:56.080]   every single target. And they will find that weakness. And now that's the practice they're going to
[00:30:56.080 --> 00:31:02.160]   expose for the next five years. So again, if they found a little way to put that little end of that
[00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:07.520]   wedge through this one installation that they want, that's a good value to them to keep things going.
[00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:11.760]   It'll be interesting to see Wardell's presentation tomorrow because he,
[00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:16.400]   instead of disassembling the malware and trying to figure out what what it did,
[00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:21.120]   he created that command and control service and then tried different commands, learned in effect
[00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:29.360]   what it could do. That should be very interesting. You know, so we'll find out more tomorrow, I guess.
[00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:39.280]   Here's his Twitter post has a picture of the screens.
[00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:48.320]   So I don't know what more to say. It should people not worry about it. Sounds like Apple's fixed it.
[00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:52.960]   Apple patches for variant one earlier in this year, but variant two. I don't know if it's been
[00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:57.680]   patched yet. Well, I think that in general, it's for whatever computer you're using or your
[00:31:57.680 --> 00:32:04.160]   iPhone or anything else. At this point, we really all have to stay visual. You just have to look at
[00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:10.880]   keeping these updates really running and not thinking that it's not going to affect you anymore.
[00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:14.880]   And so I think that there's so many hacks going out. And this is really the next big
[00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:19.200]   wild, wild west across so many places that we have to think about it. I have to admit that even
[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:25.040]   the more you use Apple Pay, the more you feel like you want that kind of security. The idea of
[00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:28.160]   every time I slide a card, I'm like, I don't know if this is really going to how long this is going
[00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:32.880]   to last, you know, where I feel safe sliding a card or using a chip. I mean, they already have
[00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:37.120]   chip readers. They have slider readers. And you feel like you really want biometrics to be
[00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:42.240]   incorporated into a lot more of what we do. I think that there's going to be some point, I think
[00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:48.080]   Apple Hut retailers are moving slowly towards whether it's Apple Pay or Samsung Pay or all these
[00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:52.400]   other ones that you have an option for. I think that we're going to move to a point where we kind
[00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:56.560]   of expect that. And there'll be a certain level of customers that just don't want to.
[00:32:56.560 --> 00:33:00.320]   If given a choice won't chop at places that don't carry it.
[00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:06.160]   Yeah. As a practical matter, for Mac users and iOS users, I think it's just down to make sure you're
[00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:10.640]   running the latest version of the OS, make sure you're running the latest patches. Because one of
[00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:17.920]   the biggest vulnerabilities to a network is not a huge breaches in security. It's the idea that
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:24.640]   there is that one Mac that's still running 10.5 10.4 because the department uses it for
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:28.800]   this one tool and they really don't want to swap out a system that's working. But
[00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:35.600]   they've lost out on five years of revolutions in nailing things down. And that's the point where
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:39.200]   that's the that's the weak point that gets people access the entire network. Should they
[00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:43.440]   should they should want so want to? But no, it's not it's not like Android. It's not like Windows.
[00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:47.360]   You don't really have to take an active stance against it. You just have to make sure that if
[00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:51.360]   there's a if there's a system update working for you, if there's a security update waiting for you,
[00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:53.520]   you download that thing and you go.
[00:33:53.520 --> 00:34:00.080]   Wardle also points out that even though there is a technique that's been known for some time on
[00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:03.840]   how you could turn on the eyesight camera on your Macintosh without turning on the light,
[00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:11.440]   this version of fruit flight doesn't employ that technique. So it's either old or they said
[00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:17.600]   it's really not that sophisticated. It's feature complete is the word or word will use. And again,
[00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:21.840]   my understanding is that they've shoved that into the secure enclave now. So it's almost impossible
[00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:28.560]   to get around that. Yeah. Yeah. If you're interested, the Wardle has a whole set of OS 10 security
[00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:35.600]   tools that you might be interested in his website objective dash S E E get it.com objective dash
[00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:43.760]   S E E dot com. Knock knock, see what's persistently installed on your Mac, task explore always useful
[00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:48.960]   block block provides continual protection by monitoring persistence locations. I don't even
[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:55.840]   know what that means. Ransom where and a lot more. This is very cool. And these are all free. So.
[00:34:55.840 --> 00:35:01.920]   And it's also not a bad idea just to put a piece of sticker or something in front of your
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:07.840]   eyesight camera. I always have something in front of the camera because mostly it's because I will
[00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:15.040]   have like a phone briefing or a web meeting briefing. And I didn't know they wanted to see the camera
[00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:20.320]   as well. It's like, Oh, I would have put on a clean shirt and shade had I known that you were
[00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:25.200]   going to be turning on my camera. That's a nice thing. Yeah. But nonetheless, it's the one way
[00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:29.360]   to be sure that the other kind of worst case scenario, they can get their microphone and they
[00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:32.640]   can get your keystrokes. But at least they're not. There's one thing they can't possibly break
[00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:37.920]   through, which is a strip of gaffer tape or even the sticker from a banana or piece of fruit on
[00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:46.400]   top of your camera lens. Yeah. Yeah. Let's see. Grant Park, Illinois. Yes. Saturday afternoon.
[00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:52.400]   The scene of mass carnage. Well, not really carnage. But if you're.
[00:35:52.400 --> 00:36:01.600]   If you're John Hanky, you probably weren't all that thrilled about the events. If you were the
[00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:10.160]   Pokemon company, you probably weren't thrilled. Yeah. Let's let's show John Hanky taking the stage
[00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:25.280]   at Pokefest to booze fix the game. 20,000 Pokemon go players there to catch very rare, never before
[00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:31.200]   seen Pokemon to fill out their pokey decks. You know, who else was there embedded reporter?
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:38.320]   Renee Richie. The biggest fear at the beginning, I'm told, was that you might have a thunderstorm.
[00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:44.080]   Yeah, there was rain early on, which I was actually not a verse to because it was so hot the day
[00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:47.600]   before. And you know, the sun, I think, was your bigger enemy than the rain. So it was cool in the
[00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:52.560]   morning. It did get hot during the day and things started off fine. Like John Hanky was walking
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:56.960]   around with his son playing the game. Everyone was, you know, having interesting time, but they
[00:36:56.960 --> 00:37:01.360]   just couldn't get people into the venue fast enough. They had a capacity of 20,000 people. I think
[00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:07.120]   it probably hit 15 to 18,000. But that's a lot of people. The biggest problem is that this park
[00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:12.480]   usually hosts things like Lala Palooza, which are way bigger than Pokefest, Pokemon Gofest.
[00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:17.680]   And Pokemon Gofest took up the, like one small corner of the park, which is usually, I think,
[00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:22.000]   four or five times bigger for Lala Palooza. And that it was all set up for that, all the infrastructure.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.640]   There was millions of dollars of equipment from all the major carriers, including antennas and
[00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:31.600]   repeaters. There was fiber around the buildings, fiber inside the park. There were dishes set up
[00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:36.080]   to beam bandwidth into the park. And they were fairly confident. I think they get upwards of 100,000
[00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:44.720]   people for Lala Palooza. But just, I think they continuously and perplexingly fail to understand
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:50.800]   just almost like the iPhone on AT&T back and they just how much data, how quickly can hit a network
[00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:56.000]   and how they have zero ability to scale that fast. They can handle 100,000 people when it's
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.280]   spread out, when all they're doing is a little bit of light streaming and snap chatting and stuff.
[00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:04.560]   But if everybody is hitting sockets over and over again for a massive multiplayer online game that
[00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:10.080]   has to be timed all the time, then AT&T went down, Verizon went down, Sprint went down.
[00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:14.320]   That's the question. People said they weren't getting any bars. So
[00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:22.240]   it had bars. They had no back. Okay. So that's the question. And we have the phone company
[00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:25.280]   said anything because I'm wondering is it their fault or an Iantic fault?
[00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:29.040]   It's both. So they all crash. So people couldn't get on. And if you could get on,
[00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:32.080]   you couldn't authenticate. And if you could authenticate, you couldn't interact. And if you
[00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:36.480]   could interact, you would freeze and crash. So those latter couple of three things are
[00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:40.960]   Niantics problems. Yeah. And there was Greg Ferrell pointed out Sunday on Twitch,
[00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:45.920]   not much of a surprise. Niantics is known for building scalable servers.
[00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:50.400]   And there was some concern that the so there are a lot of things were put in place to stop
[00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:54.320]   spoofers, which are people who faked their GPS location to play when they're not at the park,
[00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:59.040]   which is what I would have done. Right. Yeah. Totally. So you just kind of QR code to
[00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:03.360]   enable the festivities. But there was some rumors that all the code they put into sort of block
[00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:07.600]   out this spoofers ended up causing problems for anybody who was legitimately there as well.
[00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:13.760]   Did you get a Lugia? So it was interesting. So I could play in the there was the
[00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:19.440]   why everything went down. Wifi went on everything went down. I could play in the press area. I was
[00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:23.440]   fine. If I moved five feet out to that, I would just time out and there were little pockets like
[00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:27.520]   that. And because I'm roaming, I can jump to any GSM carriers. So I could just keep switching
[00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:30.960]   carriers, which most people can't do. So I could switch carriers in different areas,
[00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:35.520]   try to get a signal. Some people played just fine. There were some percentage of people who for some
[00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:39.680]   reason had no problem. A lot of people were just chanting, we can't play, we can't play. And it
[00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:45.280]   was getting really ugly as the afternoon wore on. John Hanky, though, he was fantastic. He stood
[00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:50.160]   there. He signed autographs. He took people were swinging vitriol at him. And he just stood
[00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:53.360]   there and took he did not hide the head of the CMO, the chief marketing officer,
[00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:58.720]   quickly did not hide at all. They were always upfront. The PR people like nothing is on background.
[00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:03.280]   All of his on the record record us if you want to. They made statements frequently. So they were
[00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:08.240]   top not. You could just see it like they just they just could not turn off animation. This is
[00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:15.920]   from business insider who's John talking to the crowd. I know that you guys are probably getting
[00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:23.920]   logged on this morning. It's really disenfranchising to not be able
[00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:30.320]   to bunch of millennial nerds who have the worst frustration of their life. They can't catch a
[00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:35.120]   little. Yeah. Well, and they have 13% of people who came from outside the US as well. And that's
[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:38.960]   so towards the end of the day, they came out and said they're going to do several things. One is
[00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:43.360]   they're going to refund tickets. So if you know, not obviously not airfare hotel, but they're going
[00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:48.640]   to reach the ticket. Right. I don't remember how much the ticket was. It was it was not huge.
[00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:52.320]   My money, but it was not insignificant. Yeah. It was some small amount of money. They're going to
[00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:57.680]   give you $100 worth of pocket coins in like with the in game currency. And they're giving everyone
[00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:01.840]   illusion, which was the one of the legendaries, the legendary Pokemon, which everyone was there
[00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:05.120]   to catch. It was supposed to be the big it was supposed to be this glorious big debut of a
[00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:09.920]   legendary rate. And they just they couldn't do it. And then afterwards, they sort of unleashed all
[00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:14.240]   these rates or that was a nice story. The ending to the story was actually phenomenal because
[00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:18.640]   people were super frustrated, but they extended the range of the event for two miles outside the
[00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:22.480]   park in hopes of getting rid of just, you know, it was just too many people clogged too closely
[00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:26.480]   together. And they want to disperse people out and around the park, it stayed bad. But as you walked
[00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:31.520]   away, everything started to work. And they made the catch rate, the unlock to legendary is Lucia
[00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:36.000]   and Articuno, because the mystic team won all the challenges that the most popular team
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:41.360]   on the planet. So they went all challenges. I have to be valor. So I don't I'm so popular.
[00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:47.840]   We came in second, Leo. We came in second. What color is that? Is it blue? So it's the blue ice
[00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:53.360]   blue, the red firebird and the yellow electric blue, but you and they made it 100% catch rate.
[00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:58.000]   So as long as you participated, and they were so they were probably about 10,000 people left,
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:03.280]   groups of 400 people on every corner, just having a blast catching like catching these raids,
[00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:07.360]   but this is later in the day. This is after everybody left. Yeah, after everybody left and
[00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:11.280]   went on and stayed on till about 10 o'clock at night. And people were having a blast. Everyone
[00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:15.280]   was super everyone throughout the entire thing was super nice. There were no riots, no disturbances,
[00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:19.840]   no one had to be ejected as far as I could tell. And that's I think that was a better event than
[00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:23.840]   the one they're in to plan. Like if people had just come in to Chicago, had everything else made
[00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:28.000]   available to them in that radius, you would have had a lot of happy people. And I think they did a
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.400]   pretty good job in salvaging it towards the end. One of the fundamental problems in Chicago is
[00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:36.560]   there's a lot of challenges with bandwidth, especially cellular networks. Something we've
[00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:44.480]   had some experience with in Chicago. And so I mean GPS by itself, in most of most of the area over,
[00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:48.160]   I think you've done a, have you done an event in Grant Park? I think you have.
[00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:53.440]   We've worked on, yeah, we have done, we have worked on an event in Grant Park a while ago.
[00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:59.920]   And but the, but one of the big, the big things is that the bandwidth in general,
[00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:04.960]   what you get into with older cities is that people don't want to put antennas on their older
[00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:08.960]   buildings and they don't want to give access. And so you end up with all kinds of problems there.
[00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:13.920]   The reality is it's really, really hard to go from not doing a lot of these events to growing to
[00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:18.800]   20,000 immediately because what you don't realize is for 20,000 people, you need 230 access points.
[00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:22.800]   I mean, that, you know, it's not, it just isn't going to work if you don't put a, you know,
[00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:27.120]   and you might need multiple 10 gig connections that come in. And those are all things that can
[00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:34.800]   be done in Grant Park. But you, but I would guess that even though they put stuff in, they probably
[00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:41.120]   didn't put that much in. And so, and so the, you know, being able to handle 20 or 30,000 or 100,000
[00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:45.760]   people and have them all have workable Wi-Fi is something that happens on a weekly basis at
[00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:50.320]   conferences and conventions. It is, but it takes, there's a handful of companies that do that well.
[00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:55.680]   And it is an incredible amount of work and it would have cost to do that right.
[00:43:55.680 --> 00:44:00.800]   Budget probably would have been in the 100,000 to 200,000. Of course, someone thinking that
[00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:04.240]   numbers wise, they're going to think, well, I'm charging $20,000 and there's 20,000 people coming.
[00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:08.880]   It's the whole budget, you know, to make that, to make that, you know, actually work on a big chunk
[00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:12.160]   of the budget, but it would have been worth it, you know, because it would have been worth it for
[00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:18.480]   them to lose money for X number of years to build up the idea of doing this. The people have the
[00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:22.560]   assured and they're going to have this great time and it's, but it is, it's not trivial. It's not
[00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:26.800]   like they could have just brought in a couple more Wi-Fi access points. It is a, it's people coming
[00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:30.480]   in, you know, we can have two weeks before setting up all those access points, testing,
[00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:37.040]   processing, and people who have, who deal with 50,000 or, you know, or 20,000 or 50,000 or 100,000
[00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:41.680]   people all the time. You know, there's great, there's great solutions for it. They just didn't,
[00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:45.360]   I don't, I'm going to guess that they didn't have those solutions deployed. They shouldn't have
[00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:48.720]   depended on the cell networks at all. Like they shouldn't, if you're going to do an event like that,
[00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:52.640]   you, you, you should be all, you're assuming that they're all going to hit it and you're
[00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:57.680]   ready with Wi-Fi, right? And they said they were going to make a lot. Go ahead.
[00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:01.520]   I was going to say that they, it sounded like they were going in expecting to break even or
[00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:04.640]   have a loss on this event. Like it was going to be a money loser for them. They just wanted to get
[00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:09.040]   this event out of the way. They've probably made some money on Pokemon Go.
[00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:14.160]   We're going to spend a fortune in the game, but the tickets, I think, were never meant to cover
[00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:18.400]   what they were doing in the years. Oh, no, absolutely. I think that it could have been a heavy,
[00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:21.600]   I mean, I'm just saying that when you, when you're doing something at a loss or a break even,
[00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:27.680]   you start thinking in terms of, well, like, can I really afford to put $200,000 or $150,000 into
[00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:32.560]   the Wi-Fi, right? You know, like, like, and that becomes like a budgetary conversation. I mean, we
[00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:37.920]   don't, you know, so, so we work with a lot of corporations and when, especially when it's a
[00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:42.640]   marketing thing, they, you know, there's a lot of concern about that, that, that budgetary thing,
[00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:46.880]   but in this case is a perfect example of failure is the most expensive part of a production.
[00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:52.640]   Yeah. Yeah. So did you get your Lugea? I did because they had a hundred percent catch rate after
[00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:56.960]   the event. So I went around, I spent the entire night catching. So I got, I think, four Lugea and
[00:45:56.960 --> 00:46:02.000]   three Articuno after the event. Just with one pokey ball. Since then, I've got about a 20%,
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:05.760]   like, which is normal. Normally there's like, it's about 20% chance of catching them if everything
[00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:11.680]   goes right. So it was nice to get that sort of head start at the event. This may not have been
[00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:16.880]   the worst PR ever. Certainly the 20,000 people were there. Some had maybe had a bad taste. I think
[00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:22.480]   a lot of people sounds like it, that niantic were covered and boy, they're getting a lot of
[00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:27.280]   press and a lot of people talking about how, wow, it's still hot. Pokemon goes still big.
[00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:31.760]   Yeah. And I mean, that those crowds were super impressive because I'm just a developer
[00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:35.360]   conference where, you know, 5,000 is a really big crowd. They had easily three times that.
[00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:39.360]   There were people of all ages. And again, most, for the most part, having a blast in the beginning
[00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:44.560]   and at the end of it, just that middle was incredibly painful. Yeah. And people played all over the
[00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:48.480]   city too, right? And they were nice touches like a Heracross, which usually only spawned in
[00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:52.400]   South America was there. And then there's this this Pokemon called unknown that is has a form
[00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:56.720]   for every one of the 26 letters and they had the one spelling out Chicago. Oh, you to catch at the
[00:46:56.720 --> 00:47:04.320]   end. And I said, it was like a 27,000 combat point, Pokemon, he saw. But how you're going to catch
[00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:09.360]   that? The raid bosses are all that. So the raid bosses in general have like between 25 and 35,000,
[00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:13.840]   but they shrink down when you catch them after everyone beats that shrink down to a normal
[00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:20.400]   20. I want a 27,000 something. Just to have unbalances the game. Yeah, that would
[00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:24.800]   unbalance it considerably. All right. Are you glad you went? I'm glad you went.
[00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:28.800]   Yeah, no, I mean, it was it was a lot of fun and it was a fascinating story to come. I mean,
[00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:32.880]   I was there there was Greg from TechCrunch, Alex Heath from I totally put your Greg's last name,
[00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:36.880]   Paul D's Greg. There was Alex Heath from Business Insider, a bunch of people from Polygon and The
[00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:40.880]   Verge and everything. And it was just interesting watching all of us because we had to update it
[00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:43.840]   either trying to cover it, trying to get video, trying to figure out what was going on,
[00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:47.840]   try to inform people and help them out like and tell them you had to register to get the bonuses.
[00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:54.320]   And it ended up being a big story. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And again,
[00:47:54.320 --> 00:48:01.360]   Burke is leading a cheer in the in the chatroom. Nerds, nerds. I mean, anything, anything that
[00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:04.480]   you do that no one else does that are just lame and anything that anyone else does that you don't
[00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:09.840]   do that just nerds. We this is this is a one year anniversary of the release of Pokemon Go. And I
[00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:16.480]   have to say we we had a considerable mania here at Twit for the game and we had teams and we were
[00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:19.600]   keeping track of it and everything. I haven't played it in a while, but it's still fun to play
[00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:24.000]   every once in a while, I drag it out and there's still plenty of activity around Petaloma and it's
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:28.640]   fun. And I still I find I'm still finding play because for these raids, you have to go further
[00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:32.640]   out. So I found a bunch of parks along the southern part of the island near the lakes that I'd never
[00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:37.120]   found before. They're beautiful and I wish I'd known about them way earlier. Honestly. How
[00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:43.840]   much how far did you walk? At the event I walked, oh, I don't know, 10, 15 miles just because it was
[00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:47.200]   like a round track and you had to keep walking and I kept going around the area and I'd walk
[00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:52.000]   to the venue. You can sit down and stop. You can, but it's no and if someone else I found this, you
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:56.400]   know, like heard of yeah, I heard a wildebeest everyone goes running and then five year olds
[00:48:56.400 --> 00:49:00.320]   playing soccer. They're all just but afterwards you have to walk the periphery of the park to
[00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:04.080]   catch everything else. And there was like a beautiful outdoor concert that we walked past and then
[00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:08.400]   all the way up. And I've never been to Chicago and just seeing Chicago itself was stunning.
[00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:12.080]   Like the bridges that go over the like the rivers and the overpass and all that stuff.
[00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:16.080]   I love Chicago. Yeah. And I love it even more knowing my cell phone won't work there.
[00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:21.040]   It's like that John Stewart thing I can't use my phone as a phone.
[00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:27.760]   All right. There you have it. A firsthand on the scene report from our reporter,
[00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:32.720]   Renee Richie and he flew in. He dropped the ladder. I climbed into the helicopter.
[00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:37.360]   He was to safety. All right. We've got more in a moment coming up.
[00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:42.640]   Mac Break Weekly, Annie O'Naco from the Chicago Sun Times. Renee Richie,
[00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:45.200]   who it's ironic because Andy was in Boston for this event.
[00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:52.400]   Renee Richie from Montereyall and I'm more.com and from. I wanted to stay outside the kill zone.

[00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:37.680]   I was shocked. It's not Exxon. I thought it would be Exxon. Yeah. Let me see.
[00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:44.960]   I think it's in revenue. Most profitable. Yeah, you're right. So the full list
[00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:51.600]   actually ranks Walmart as the most in revenue than Berkshire Hathaway, then Apple, then Exxon.
[00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:57.840]   But when you're talking profit, the whole thing gets rejiggered. Apple, which is number three
[00:52:57.840 --> 00:53:06.000]   overall in revenue is tops and profits by almost twice the second biggest, which is JP Morgan Chase.
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:10.400]   Now, bank's going to be all profit, right? Berkshire Hathaway is third on that list.
[00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:20.880]   Apple had $45 billion in profit. JP Morgan Chase, $24.7 billion, Berkshire Hathaway,
[00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:29.840]   24. Wells Fargo, 21, Alphabet, Google's company, 19. So that really shows you. Biggest employers,
[00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:35.600]   Apple is not really anywhere on that list. So that's another number that people often pay
[00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:43.040]   attention to is how much money you make per employee. Yeah. And Apple does quite well in that regard.
[00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:50.800]   Number three on the Forbes 500, number one in the Forbes. Most profitable.
[00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:55.440]   And number one in the title of this show. And number one in our hearts.
[00:53:55.440 --> 00:54:01.920]   Yeah. It's amazing that they're a company that makes things. They don't just move numbers from one
[00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:08.240]   computer to another to create wealth. They have to manufacture and ship things and do quality control
[00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:14.080]   and do customer service. However impressive this might be and it might not be impressive.
[00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:17.600]   It's just making money. But that's a pretty big accomplishment. Yeah.
[00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:19.920]   Not bad. They don't have dinosaurs to
[00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:25.680]   detect decay and make their money for them. Apple isn't there. And you were talking about that
[00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:32.320]   per employee. It's over. I think it's, well, this is from 2013, but really over $2 million
[00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:37.200]   per employee. Wow. And that was in 2013. Wow. Sure. It's much more now.
[00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:47.520]   Indiquent. In the past three quarters, Android owners had represented 14 to 17% of iPhone buyers.
[00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:56.400]   So that means that almost one in six iPhone buyers is coming from Android, is switching.
[00:54:56.400 --> 00:55:02.160]   Well, they're not coming from Windows phone. Well, they're switching. They're not. These
[00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:06.080]   are people not staying with Android. My last palm pre finally died after buying iPhone.
[00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:14.080]   And I was surprised to see that the iPhone 7 and 7 plus accounted for 81% of all iPhone
[00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:19.760]   iPhone sales. So I mean, I guess it makes sense. People are buying the newest iPhone, but the SE,
[00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:23.760]   we thought the SE was doing maybe a little bit more than one in five.
[00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:30.400]   By my point of view, it's not that surprising because people who are really sensitive to price
[00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:35.760]   have so many options. That's a good point. So I think that you're left with people for whom
[00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:40.480]   it's not as though I can throw away money, but I got $600 for a really good phone.
[00:55:41.360 --> 00:55:45.520]   So they just want the small phone. Our friend, Steve, our friend, Steve Kovac says,
[00:55:45.520 --> 00:55:52.000]   do not buy a smartphone this month. And I think he's right. We know that Samsung has announced
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:57.040]   they're going to have a big event. August 23rd, that will be the Galaxy Note 8 launch.
[00:55:57.040 --> 00:56:03.680]   I presume sometime between then and Apple's event in September, Google will announce a new
[00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:08.000]   Pixel phone. And of course, the squeeze, pixel, the squeeze, the pixel squeeze,
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:13.600]   pop out box, a squix box. And you know, I, it'll be really interesting to see this number a year
[00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:18.720]   from now, what percentage of new iPhone owners are buying the high end iPhone, which will probably,
[00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:24.160]   I mean, according to all reports, cost more than $1,000. How many can buy it depending on the
[00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:29.280]   their ability? Yeah, that's going to be a big issue too. We might not get ours till the spring,
[00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:33.040]   right? I mean, gosh, or you just might not, they might only make up you, you, with them.
[00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:38.480]   Can you imagine that? Like, this is, this is part of like the cost of human dignity in modern times.
[00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:45.360]   It's like, I want the new, now I know I want the new super Nintendo mini that Nintendo is coming
[00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:52.240]   out with, but I don't want to have to like, you know, do it, launch a land war against my local
[00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:58.400]   Walmart, you know, infiltrate with spies tunnel underneath to make sure that when they put one
[00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:04.880]   out, I can buy one without having to spend $400 for an eBay. It's like, all the arguments for the
[00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:10.000]   reason for Apple conceivably doing a higher price, lower edition phone are very, very sensible in
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:16.160]   many ways kind of exciting. But it's like, I hope that they can deliver on if I, but Apple,
[00:57:16.160 --> 00:57:23.600]   if I have $1,100 and I'm only $1,100, you give me a phone. I don't have to be a, I don't have to live
[00:57:23.600 --> 00:57:27.920]   in my van driving from mall to mall trying to find one. I don't have to go on.
[00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:32.800]   Like Kane from Kung Fu. Exactly. I still think I still think the apples to just
[00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:37.040]   September one apples to just say, we're going to give you the best phone we've ever made.
[00:57:37.040 --> 00:57:42.560]   It's $1,200. You can get in the front of the line right now. And we're not going to even tell you
[00:57:42.560 --> 00:57:47.120]   about it. We say $1,200. We've had $1,400. Oh, you want to be in the front of the line? That's 1,800.
[00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:50.800]   No, no, but, but I'm saying that like, we're not even going to show you what it is. We're just
[00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:53.920]   going to tell you that if you want to get in line, just, just, you just, you
[00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:57.280]   be right now and everybody would do everybody. It could be a lot of people.
[00:57:57.280 --> 00:58:01.760]   Where you have to have bought the other iPhones to qualify to buy the next iPhone.
[00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:08.000]   And then you get to buy it. I see that you skipped the iPhone 3GS. Yeah, you cannot.
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:09.440]   Yeah. Back of the line. Yeah.
[00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:14.480]   Well, that's, you know, it's interesting because that's what Ferrari does. Yeah.
[00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:19.920]   Like because literally it's like they will, it's a little production. Then it's all hand,
[00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:23.760]   really, it's a limited production cars, but then they will also make sure that,
[00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:29.520]   okay, did you buy a Ferrari from us in the past? Yes. Okay. Do you still own that Ferrari? Or did
[00:58:29.520 --> 00:58:33.760]   you sell it eight months after you bought it from us? And did you treat that car nicely?
[00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:39.440]   And so there could be, I don't know, there could be a new culture of people that have proven,
[00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:45.920]   I don't want to say loyal to your fealty. But Apple has said, you know, it turns out that you
[00:58:45.920 --> 00:58:50.560]   were really, really nice to the Apple geniuses when you had a problem. And you've been over
[00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:54.880]   backwards to be a good customer of ours. You didn't lie to us when you broke the screen.
[00:58:54.880 --> 00:59:00.560]   We, if you want, we're holding the first top 10% places for the new phone. If you want one,
[00:59:00.560 --> 00:59:03.920]   you're on the first 10% of the list. Just reply to this email the next day.
[00:59:03.920 --> 00:59:11.040]   I'm going to go into the Apple store holding my iPad 10.5, my Apple ceramic Apple watch,
[00:59:11.040 --> 00:59:16.640]   my iPhone seven. I'm saying, please, sir. So, I'm like, I'm gonna find you.
[00:59:16.640 --> 00:59:20.720]   I'm gonna get to a mobile computer. I'm a good customer.
[00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:27.600]   Your wife's rose gold puts you over the top, sir. Please. I beg of you. I've got an Apple pen.
[00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:36.960]   Apple pen. The man I brought. I'm back. I haven't bought a Mac to CX a month before you came up.
[00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:42.880]   The UCI in an obsolete. Come on. Dear, well, we'll find out it's going to be an interesting
[00:59:42.880 --> 00:59:49.680]   September. I once again have planned a vacation at a poor time leaving the country September 14th.
[00:59:49.680 --> 00:59:53.200]   Do you think I'll be able to get that iPhone 10th anniversary edition by September?
[00:59:53.200 --> 00:59:56.880]   Now that you set it on air, they're going to hold the event today. You shouldn't have told them.
[00:59:56.880 --> 01:00:02.160]   No, it's worse than that. They're going to hold the event before I leave. They're going to ship
[01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:06.080]   the phone the day after I leave. Yeah. Wait for the pot to leave the pot.
[01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:11.360]   I was able. I was very lucky. I was able to get the iPhone 7 plus before our last vacation.
[01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:16.480]   Right. Just right before it. It wasn't it was a Verizon phone. It wasn't the one I wanted.
[01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:21.760]   Carsten went out and got one and I. We traded when I got back because I wanted the piano,
[01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:26.240]   the jet black. I really, and you know what? I've never had a case on this. I'll wipe the fingerprints
[01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:31.760]   off. And it's aged very nicely. It's got a few, as they said, micro-laboration.
[01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:36.480]   Micro-brasions along the edges. But I think it's still the most beautiful phone I've ever carried.
[01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:40.720]   I mean, that is a gorgeous work. A handsome phone. Yeah. And imagine it without bezels.
[01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:46.160]   Yeah. I want the, will there be a mirror when I saw one rumor? That's.
[01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:49.360]   That's one of the rumors. Yeah. I mean, I never count. I never believe anything until Phil
[01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:53.520]   Schiller holds it up on stage. That would be such a fingerprint magnet. You know,
[01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:57.600]   I have to say the thing that's most exciting that if Apple,
[01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:01.680]   there's some challenges that I think Apple are really good at. There's some challenges
[01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:07.440]   that Apple are conceivably not really good at. One of them is that if you say that you only have to
[01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:14.000]   make 100,000 of these. So it doesn't matter if you can't source enough copies of the camera that
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:19.200]   you want. It doesn't matter if you have to throw out 40 panels for everyone that you can accept.
[01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:26.880]   This is going to be the 100,000, the 100K iPhone that we are actually going to cost 10K for.
[01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:32.880]   So do whatever you want. Money has no object. Yield is no object. Just make the coolest phone as
[01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:40.960]   Apple can define it for 2017, 2018. I wouldn't pay $10,000 to own it, but I would pay $100
[01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:47.040]   for front row seat to see it. Yeah. Actually, I wouldn't. That's hypothetical. I'd much rather
[01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:50.960]   take that $100 and spend it on clothing and clothing. If the execs were taking Hamilton,
[01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:54.640]   you'd be worth a ticket. I would definitely tune in for the live stream. If there were a
[01:01:54.640 --> 01:02:01.360]   t-shirt, I might kickstart the t-shirt. My name is Philip Schillow. You ain't seen nothing yet.
[01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:07.040]   We should have mentioned this at the top when we were talking about fruit fly, but I do hope
[01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:14.880]   you've applied 10.3.3 to your iPad, your iPhone. And yes, even your Apple watch. I was so surprised
[01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:21.200]   to get an update for my Apple watch last week. But these were updates that patched roughly
[01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:29.840]   according to the register for dozen security vulnerabilities. The 10.3.3 update, 47 flaws
[01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:36.880]   for the iPhone iPad and yes, iPod touch, including remote code execution holes in the WebKit browser
[01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:42.080]   engine. One of their biggest advantages tells the ability to update every device in every country,
[01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:47.840]   every person, all at once. Now, I have to say, I just pulled out my phone when I was looking at
[01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:52.560]   this and I have not. They don't notify you sometimes. They notify me about the watch,
[01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:54.880]   but they didn't tell me I have one for the phone too.
[01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:58.240]   They wait so usually it's a couple days because they know that people who are hyper-interested
[01:02:58.240 --> 01:03:02.080]   will do it right away and this sort of lets them load balance and then while all the crazy nerds
[01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:05.600]   get out of the way immediately, then a day or two later, they'll notify everybody.
[01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:10.560]   So you should the the picks fixes broad pwn. If you have an iPad, you probably want to do that
[01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:17.520]   right away. I mean, just don't put these off. If you're on the beta for iOS 11, what happens?
[01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:23.120]   Do they? Yeah. So they updated the developer beta, I think yesterday, not the day before,
[01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:26.640]   and the public beta was earlier today. Oh, oh, oh, so I should check. Okay.
[01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:33.200]   If you're a Mac user fixes for OS 10 Sierra, El Capitan, Yosemite as well,
[01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:39.680]   including vulnerabilities in the Intel graphics driver that allow applications to execute
[01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:44.640]   arbitrary code at the kernel level. That's never- But no more. No more Adobe updates, Leo.
[01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:48.240]   That's a nice thing. So what's the deal with flash Adobe flash? Is that
[01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:53.280]   it's fine. I was joking before and I said that DC managed to kill the flash nine times
[01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:57.840]   before Adobe had the guts to do it once. And this is really strange for me because
[01:03:57.840 --> 01:04:01.760]   some of us have been advocating that you should get off flash as fast as possible because it's
[01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:07.680]   become such a malware vector, but they really like ActiveX. They plugged a huge missing hole
[01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:12.720]   in web interactivity for many, many years. And the problem became that the web actually caught up
[01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:17.680]   and they went from being a positive to a negative, like became an anchor around the neck of the web.
[01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:22.080]   And now they're sort of finally letting it sunset after a lot of vendors started getting rid of
[01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:25.680]   them and a lot of malware attacks happened and a lot of people moved off the platform.
[01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:30.560]   But finally now Adobe has announced the end of life for flash, but only by 2020.
[01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:35.360]   Somebody tweeted on Twitter, Carolina, Milanese, they said, 2020 will go down in his history is
[01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:40.320]   the year when people can finally stop asking why iPad did not support Adobe flash.
[01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:45.040]   It was so funny. The funniest part about all of that is that Adobe had killer marketing or
[01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:48.720]   something because all the time people were saying, Apple, why don't you include flash?
[01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:54.720]   It did not exist. Adobe literally could not make flash work on mobile for years after the controversy.
[01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:59.920]   And when they did, I had it on Android and on Palm. It wasn't great. Like it did not fit their
[01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:04.320]   interactivity model and still Apple got a lion's share of the blame and anger overall.
[01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:06.160]   And every review said they're missing flash.
[01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:13.280]   I have to correct that. The first was available as I recall, it was about a year after the
[01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:17.840]   iPad before the first or maybe maybe two. I remember the first one was.
[01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:24.080]   No, I think the first one was actually the Blackberry's playbook or their first tablet.
[01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:27.600]   I remember that specifically because that was the first thing I was curious to find out because
[01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:33.040]   that was after Steve Jobs big letter about here's why flash is a terrible idea on mobile.
[01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:38.320]   Here's why it would never work. And I was like, no, the playback is actually very good.
[01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:46.080]   No, the sync is actually right on. It's sort of was nothing like what H.264 would become like.
[01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:52.480]   But it was fine. It didn't kill the battery. There were trade-offs for CPU, I'm sure. But
[01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:59.200]   it sticks out because it's one of those times where there was a big impressive letter about why
[01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:04.080]   this is why man will never ever reach the moon. And it's like, okay, keep reading because the
[01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:09.440]   second stage of the Saturn five just lit off. And now they're headed for the far more islands.
[01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:14.560]   So I thought there was a mobile before they played because the playbook had much more resources.
[01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:18.080]   And I thought they got it onto Palm or Android earlier, but I might be wrong.
[01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:23.360]   I think there was a plugin for you're right, but we're going way back.
[01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:26.880]   And I'm like, as we've established, I'm running on Hope and Kathy.
[01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:30.720]   I just remember not being able to like hover state. It was just no,
[01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:34.240]   like because it was a touch device. There wasn't the mouse over support.
[01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:40.640]   You'll see we also have to remember that that flashes a couple of things. It's for interactive
[01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:46.240]   content and like really cool media content. So the fact that you couldn't get you couldn't get
[01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:51.280]   an app like like a Netflix style app or a Netflix style app might work just fine.
[01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:53.760]   But people were using it for like courseware for like inner
[01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:57.200]   assets. Every restaurant still a lot of vertical stuff.
[01:06:57.200 --> 01:06:59.120]   Oh, yeah. Yeah.
[01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:04.640]   Yeah, it's it's the it's it is known as the jigsaw puzzle piece generator
[01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:07.840]   on websites all across this land and ours.
[01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:09.520]   Steve Johnson, associate muscle by not sharing.
[01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:14.000]   But he was like on the original iPad demonstration. He was just sitting there on the chair going
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:17.520]   through the New York Times didn't care at all about that big puzzle piece.
[01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:20.560]   Just scrolled right past it.
[01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:22.560]   Oh, I didn't notice that. Oh, that's funny.
[01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:26.480]   Oh, that's funny. And also and also should we mention that a lot of the
[01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:29.760]   a lot of the wonderful content we were missing out on the iPad were ads.
[01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:31.120]   Right.
[01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:32.000]   Flash based ads.
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.200]   So, yeah.
[01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:33.840]   That's so bad.
[01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:38.080]   Well, if people were upset about their video, like their little jutamied illicit video sites too
[01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:38.640]   was a big cause.
[01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:43.440]   For a long time, I didn't install Flash on a system in a long time. But if you use Google
[01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:48.640]   Chrome, it has Flash version of Flash built in. Google has announced at the same time
[01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:53.040]   that they are going to discontinue Flash and Chrome.
[01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:57.280]   They put interesting stat from this post on the Google blog.
[01:07:57.280 --> 01:08:03.200]   Three years ago, 80% of desktop Chrome users visited a site with Flash every day.
[01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:08.080]   Today, that number is down to 17% and continues to decline.
[01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:09.120]   That's the good news.
[01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:11.520]   WebKit.org has a good post on it too.
[01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:16.080]   And one thing I didn't realize is you have to even it does not ship with Flash installed.
[01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:19.200]   If you install it, you have to give it permission to access a website.
[01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:21.920]   And if you don't go to that website at a month, it turns it back off again.
[01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:22.720]   Oh, that's awesome.
[01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:23.600]   Yeah.
[01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:24.080]   That's awesome.
[01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:27.040]   And yes, I did just get iOS 11 public beta three.
[01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:29.120]   Pushed out to my 10.5.
[01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:30.080]   I had checked this morning.
[01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:31.360]   I did not have it yet.
[01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:33.200]   So it's coming and I'm downloading it right now.
[01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:35.840]   So that you should absolutely do that.
[01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:41.200]   The broad pwn and some other exploits that are in the wild is probably good to patch.
[01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:46.160]   And you buy by Flash.
[01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:46.960]   Buy by Flash.
[01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:48.080]   All right, P slash.
[01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:48.560]   All right, P.
[01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:51.200]   The clips app is still alive.
[01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:55.040]   And if more than alive, a million monthly unique users.
[01:08:55.040 --> 01:09:00.560]   This is the video app that app million released, a million monthly unique users.
[01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:01.920]   That's a decent numbers.
[01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:02.720]   Not a huge number.
[01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:03.360]   It's me.
[01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:04.080]   I'm Mickey Mouse.
[01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:06.000]   Yeah, they've just added the Mickey.
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.080]   So you can have brunch with Mickey.
[01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:10.720]   They've added some Pixar characters as well.
[01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:13.760]   There's yeah, there's new overlays.
[01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:14.400]   There's new poll.
[01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:15.280]   They call them posters.
[01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:17.760]   They're really sort of like those interstitial title cards.
[01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:19.520]   The one thing that I thought was really, really cool,
[01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:22.160]   was they've allowed you to do sequential overlays.
[01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:24.560]   And that's especially good if you're doing like how to videos or something.
[01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:29.200]   So now you can hold down to start adding a video, add an overlay to it.
[01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:30.880]   You know, let go add an overlay to it.
[01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:31.520]   Hold it down again.
[01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:32.400]   Add another overlay.
[01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:33.040]   Hold it down again.
[01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:34.160]   Add another overlay.
[01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:38.400]   And they'll build out over that timeline, which is super neat if you're building sort of.
[01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:40.080]   I'm going to have to go back and play with it.
[01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:41.680]   I mean, it's an absolute number.
[01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:43.040]   28 on the App Store.
[01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:46.240]   A million downloads over the first four days.
[01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:49.680]   But I feel like it's kind of, you know, got a lot of attention at first.
[01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:50.480]   And I don't know.
[01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:51.520]   I haven't used it since then.
[01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:54.960]   Which it's a darn shame because it is one of the nicest pieces of software.
[01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:56.480]   Pieces of software that Apple has ever written.
[01:09:56.480 --> 01:09:59.360]   And I would include like hypercard in that list.
[01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:04.880]   It's just what it does is unexpectedly beautiful and professional with such a small amount of
[01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:05.200]   effort.
[01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:07.840]   All you have to do is exert some creative will.
[01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:13.200]   And you can do some amazing things that kind of gets you more interested in making more videos.
[01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:18.240]   And I think that if it hasn't really taken off the way that I think it should have,
[01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:22.160]   I think it's only because of not enough people actually knowing that it exists.
[01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:27.920]   Or people being perfectly happy, holding up the camera, shooting a 30 second video,
[01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:32.320]   and not bothering to trim it one end or the other, and just simply posting it to Instagram or Facebook.
[01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:36.960]   But yeah, I mean, the stuff that Ren has been posting, she's been doing a bunch of like many,
[01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:39.280]   many Derby training videos.
[01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:42.000]   And it's like, how much money did she put?
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:43.520]   And why did she have a staff?
[01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:48.080]   And like, and remind myself, no, she has an iPhone and she has this free app.
[01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:50.720]   And also she's very, very creative.
[01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:52.880]   And she knows how to, she knows how to tell the story visually.
[01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:57.360]   But the polish of this video is like, oh, anybody has access to that.
[01:10:57.360 --> 01:11:01.440]   Anybody who has the verb of a Ren Caldwell can do some pretty amazing stuff.
[01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:04.960]   I think we're just also, there might be some people who are just waiting for like,
[01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:08.480]   sort of like we have sticker support and iMessage now for almost any sort of pack.
[01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:11.040]   Because right now the Disney stuff is cute, but you'll use it a few times.
[01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:15.440]   But once you get to be able to put sort of any animated sticker or something into your video as
[01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:18.320]   you go, I think that'll unlock a lot more potential for it too.
[01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:21.200]   I mean, sticker memes.
[01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:25.200]   Though they also made editing the, so they do automatic subtitling.
[01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:27.040]   And they made it, some people didn't know that it was theirs.
[01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:28.480]   They just assumed that you couldn't edit it.
[01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:30.400]   So they put an explicit button for that now.
[01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:33.920]   I know, when we first played with it, I couldn't figure out how to edit it.
[01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:35.760]   You had to show me or serenity did one of these.
[01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:36.240]   Oh, yeah.
[01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:36.400]   Yeah.
[01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:36.480]   Yeah.
[01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:38.240]   So yeah, there's a button that lets you edit it now.
[01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:38.480]   Good.
[01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:38.880]   Thank you.
[01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:44.880]   Future AirPods, Corinne and Apple Insider might feature automated audio pass-through.
[01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:52.400]   This is a patent application Apple published last week that describes an advanced in-ear
[01:11:52.400 --> 01:12:00.800]   headphone device that uses sensors and valves to seal out ambient noise in certain situations,
[01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:07.280]   but then letting in augmented and augmenting external sounds in others.
[01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:13.600]   So somehow knowing what you should be hearing, an in-speaker hybrid audio transparency system,
[01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:15.120]   I don't usually pay attention to patents.
[01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:16.960]   I mean, Apple patents, everything.
[01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:21.280]   If you look at what they're doing with the HomePod and the Apple AH chip,
[01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:25.120]   where they're basically deconstructing and reconstructing audio with a lot of intelligence
[01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:28.240]   about what you're listening to, it's not impossible to believe that at some scale,
[01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:31.280]   that technology will start moving into smaller and smaller devices.
[01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:31.600]   Right.
[01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:32.160]   Yeah.
[01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:37.280]   Well, and I think that we're getting to a new, kind of, this is moving towards a persistent
[01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:43.360]   headphone experience where you're not going to ever take them out, or not take them out at work,
[01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:47.360]   or not take them out at work, or not take them out for some long period of time,
[01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:52.960]   where we just want to just have it there, you know, and I think that, and then you're, you know,
[01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:55.680]   you're hearing what you want to hear when you want to hear it.
[01:12:56.240 --> 01:12:59.120]   You're listening to music, you're listening to calls, you're talking to people.
[01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:02.400]   One of the big challenges with any of these is figuring out what to do with the microphone,
[01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:06.480]   you know, so how do you, you know, because once you start sticking it really in your ear,
[01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:07.760]   you don't have anything hanging out.
[01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:11.920]   I mean, part of what makes the currently the AirPods work is the fact that they're still
[01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:15.040]   have some kind of directional mic that's going to be able to pick up your voice.
[01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:16.560]   But the, go ahead.
[01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:20.400]   Well, this was exciting about, because one of the things I was hoping was that this would become
[01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:26.720]   a new kind of form of hearing aid, and this patent actually kind of gives it some of those
[01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:31.040]   capabilities. There's two things I'm really interested in. One is that sound augmentation
[01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:36.960]   system that is activated when the headphone valve is a valve on it, is open, it picks up
[01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:42.080]   audio from the external microphone, adjusts its frequency, and that frequency adjustment
[01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:46.800]   could adjust for, for instance, inadequacies in your own hearing, and then passes it on.
[01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:51.600]   As if you're not wearing headphones. The other thing it does is it automatically adjusts to
[01:13:51.600 --> 01:14:00.480]   air pressure. So it could regulate ear pressure in during flights, no more popping ears.
[01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:04.400]   That would be a really good reason to leave your AirPods in all the time.
[01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:08.320]   Unless it doesn't work. It would also be really cool. That's really painful.
[01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:11.040]   Yeah, right. That's true. Yeah.
[01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:13.920]   But yeah, you know, there's so many different ways that you use this technology.
[01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:20.240]   I just think it's one of the most coolest things that any company could possibly do is a version
[01:14:20.240 --> 01:14:25.600]   of the Amazon Echo, but it really is an earpiece. It's not just, "Oh, well, you got this Bluetooth
[01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:30.080]   thing that can connect to Siri. I'm talking about, but I'm talking about, no, think of it more like
[01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:35.040]   a self-contained smart speaker inside your ear." And one of the things that's going to be important
[01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:41.200]   is for that assistant to be able to be heard through ambient noise. And one way to make something
[01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:45.680]   easier to hear is to make it louder, but that's dangerous. But another way is to sort of create
[01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:53.680]   a void around these words that the smart assistant is saying amongst the envelope of sound that's
[01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:59.120]   going into your ears. Similarly, just the idea of listening to music, people tend to crank.
[01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:03.040]   I'm listening to podcasts while I write my bike or take a walk. And sometimes I can't hear this
[01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:08.720]   particular speaker because they're a little bit soft-spoken, a little bit too NPR for
[01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:13.120]   someone who's walking next to traffic. And so I crank it up, and maybe it's not unhealthy,
[01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:17.920]   but if I'm killing my hearing, I wouldn't know that it's killing my hearing. But imagine it being
[01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:23.840]   able to essentially, again, create some white space around this piece of music or this piece of text
[01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:29.680]   around the ambient noise. It would allow people to hear things clearly when the volume is turned
[01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:35.760]   up to 50%. So you're absolutely right, Leo. We all say, whenever we talk about patents, that
[01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:39.520]   these are just ideas that they have. They have lawyers who are going to get paid, whether they
[01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:44.320]   file patents or not, means we'll have them file some patents. But the more you see what Apple is
[01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:48.560]   really, really proud of and excited about over the past couple of years, I think that audio might
[01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:52.880]   be the thing that's kind of like multi-touch for them, where it's like, this is a signature thing we
[01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:58.400]   can do exceptionally well. We can build physical desirable emotional products around the sound
[01:15:58.400 --> 01:16:06.320]   experience. And so we are going to put a lot of our second trillion dollars of future into
[01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:11.440]   doing being a great audio company. There's a website, of course, patentleyapple.com that covers
[01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:19.920]   Apple's patents. And last week, Apple was granted 54 patents total, including an iPhone high five
[01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:25.840]   part two. Yeah, iPhone smart dock was Siri. My only question is how much of that money will
[01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:32.000]   take to license Scarlett Johansson's voice. That's what we really want. Wireless charging.
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:37.600]   Just look at all of these. That was one of the rumors that the distance charging for the iPhone,
[01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:41.680]   it would require like a small accessory or an iPhone dock. And that would actually end up
[01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:46.000]   being part of the hub system eventually, where it would coordinate with the intelligence on the
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:50.400]   device and the other sound equipment that you had in the room. I don't know about you, but I'm
[01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:56.320]   pretty excited about disambiguating heteronemms in speech synthesis. Right after some of the
[01:16:56.320 --> 01:17:02.400]   audits is off of my list. So if you look at this list, that's really underscores what we've
[01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:06.480]   been saying, which is that Apple patents every idea they have. This is just good defense.
[01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:11.600]   It also means Apple has got a lot of point xers on the payroll. Yeah, if you get a
[01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:16.640]   building full of lawyers, they got to do something. And I patented LaPort. That's the question.
[01:17:18.160 --> 01:17:22.400]   Are you going to Santa Fe this weekend, Andy? I'm I know you're a big opera fan. In fact,
[01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:32.000]   this combines two of Andy's passions, Steve Jobs and opera. Santa Fe Opera is debuting the Steve Jobs
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:40.880]   Opera. Here's a still from it, obviously was in jobs in the garage. You've discovered the Apple one.
[01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:46.960]   Yes, I made the Apple one. I bet Appie Andy could do a very good. That's Garrett Sorensen and Steve
[01:17:46.960 --> 01:17:54.720]   Wozniak, Edward Parks, Steve Jobs. This is another scene. Oh, the black turtleneck,
[01:17:54.720 --> 01:18:01.280]   mock turtleneck makes its debut with a bunch of iPhone screens and some sycophants sitting in
[01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:03.680]   I said, are you getting it yet? Are you getting it? Yeah.
[01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:15.680]   Santa Fe Opera commissioned in 2015. I don't know. Anybody think you're excited? It's called the
[01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:20.240]   Revolution. Is this the revolution of Steve Jobs? Is that what it's called?
[01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:28.160]   Well, okay. I mean, with R and parenthesis. It's in English, so it's going to be more
[01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:33.440]   appealing to a lot of people than Italian operas myself. Let's see. This is the making of
[01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:45.040]   miniaturized and simplified the composer Mason dates. I want some clips.
[01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:54.080]   There's so many issues with the com. Oh, here we go. Here's some. Let's see if this is.
[01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:59.440]   I want singing. The thing that was. No, I don't want talking. I want singing.
[01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:04.880]   This guy talking, talking, talking, talking. Oh, here's some singing. Steve Jobs with this,
[01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:10.480]   which is Quicksilver, who's taking a lot of this here. Electronic to the more oceanic lyrical
[01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:16.080]   harmonies. They're not going to last you. Here are they. World of Co-Boon. Steve Jobs.
[01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:23.360]   Has a very. Oh, please. I guess this is just. But this is a man. This is a tease,
[01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:28.000]   promo. I think we need to go to Santa Fe this weekend. And in that tension, I think we'll.
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:34.160]   It's yeah. I mean, it's it's it's it's a challenge, I think.
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:42.720]   I think that one of the great things about opera is that it can make really broad and maybe silly
[01:19:42.720 --> 01:19:48.000]   topics seem like the most important and emotional thing in the world. So if we're talking about
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:56.880]   if we're going to have like an act to Aria, that's about. That handicap spot is nobody's but mine.
[01:19:56.880 --> 01:20:05.680]   I don't care what the cops will say. I mean, it's nice. If you put it and realize that opera
[01:20:05.680 --> 01:20:11.360]   singers, the thing that's that makes them unique is that off the career ones, they have spent
[01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:18.000]   eight years studying technique before they're even allowed to really sing any real Arias.
[01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:21.760]   That means that you've got the you've got the equipment necessary to now start to understand
[01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:28.560]   the emotion of this song. So that's why you can give them. You can give them the polywali
[01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:36.000]   wally doodle and they will find the undone, trampled depths in the well of emotion that's in this
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:41.360]   little plinky plinky folk song. So there is there is a long standing tradition of writing
[01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:46.400]   operas about current events. There's of course an opera. The reason why. Yes.
[01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:52.560]   The death of clinghopper. This is the dramatization of the
[01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:54.560]   the
[01:20:54.560 --> 01:21:05.920]   That's a terrorist singing. He's about to push clinghopper in his wheelchair off the boat.
[01:21:05.920 --> 01:21:12.880]   I'm not a big fan of modern opera, to be honest with you.
[01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:19.520]   Well, there's also there's also a Star Trek version of the the abduction from the Seragio.
[01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:27.280]   We're certainly a way where it's been hit naps by clinghoans and Kirk has the leads
[01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:32.720]   and away team to get the superior back. I don't know though. I know I know opera stars are trained
[01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:37.200]   to do this, but I don't know if any opera star should ever be forced to sing the line America is
[01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:42.560]   one big Jew. That is that is probably not something he was prepared for in his career.
[01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:48.560]   Nevertheless, that's from the opera. The death of clinghopper as performed by the
[01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:56.800]   Metropolitan Opera. I finally saw Hamilton in San Francisco.
[01:21:56.800 --> 01:22:04.720]   Yeah, my my kids. You guys still have every word. It's funny when I was sitting in the
[01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:07.680]   audience. I was saying that to the guy sitting next to me. This is the first time I've ever
[01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:12.400]   been a musical where everybody who's not seen the musical, but everybody knows every line.
[01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:19.920]   No, I they said. So, you know, we could we could do before the my wife got tickets.
[01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:24.800]   They they said, well, we really know we really love Hamilton. And I was like, okay,
[01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:29.840]   we'll sing something and literally, you know, acapella in the car. They just sang the whole song.
[01:22:29.840 --> 01:22:32.800]   You know, like, they just think the whole song the whole song with all the bad words and all the
[01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:36.720]   other things. And they, you know, they're like, they just have to they know the song. And so I
[01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:40.880]   felt like it was like this moment where it was, you know, obviously a sizable investment to take
[01:22:40.880 --> 01:22:45.440]   them to Hamilton. And but it was this, you know, they had I felt like they had earned it. It wasn't
[01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:50.240]   like me trying to expose them to a musical. It was something that they were, you know, really
[01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:54.160]   knew a lot about, you know, they knew every song every bit. They were, you know, so excited. And it
[01:22:54.160 --> 01:22:58.480]   was it was the first it's the first musical ever been to. So it was for me, it was a great,
[01:22:58.480 --> 01:23:06.560]   was it good? Amazing. Yes. So the guy who sang the part of King George for a brief time, not a
[01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:10.320]   brief time, but for a while in New York, he wasn't the original King George. He's what I saw.
[01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:17.040]   Jonathan Groff is actually in a new podcast that's a musical called 36 Questions.
[01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:19.600]   A Musical Podcast. It's a musical podcast.
[01:23:19.600 --> 01:23:25.840]   So and Groff is great. And I we listened to a little bit of it the other day. And I thought
[01:23:25.840 --> 01:23:32.000]   that when this sounds pretty good. Audible. Get your free book from all the people.
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:40.720]   I don't know how they do the ads. Even if you.
[01:23:40.720 --> 01:23:42.720]   This is.
[01:23:42.720 --> 01:23:54.560]   The music just the singers, but this is pretty cool. There's a, this is, I mean, that's a lot
[01:23:54.560 --> 01:24:00.720]   of money going into a podcast. It's not exactly what you'd expect, but if you're interested,
[01:24:00.720 --> 01:24:07.920]   it's called 36 Questions. It's a musical podcast. Believe it or not.
[01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:11.920]   And they're already up to four episodes.
[01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:19.920]   You say the price of your free. I love he was so good.
[01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:21.200]   My love not.
[01:24:21.200 --> 01:24:23.280]   Price for willing to pay.
[01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:31.680]   You will be like soon. You'll see. You'll remember you belong to me.
[01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:34.400]   Da da da da da.
[01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:36.640]   Oh, she's rise and pass.
[01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:39.280]   And see each other.
[01:24:39.280 --> 01:24:40.160]   Never seen it.
[01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:41.120]   Can see everywhere.
[01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:41.920]   And when push.
[01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:42.480]   Yeah, I can't think.
[01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:44.720]   It's because Andy can sing.
[01:24:44.720 --> 01:24:45.760]   Yeah, he can.
[01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:46.480]   I'm sitting at the tenors.
[01:24:46.480 --> 01:24:48.160]   I can not sing anything.
[01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:49.440]   Such a good song.
[01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:51.040]   Such a good sign.
[01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:57.520]   State Farm, Sue's apple over house fire caused by the effective iPhone.
[01:24:57.520 --> 01:24:59.280]   Who cares? Of course they do.
[01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:04.880]   Uh, Verizon points finger at Niantic for problems that led to bookie.
[01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:05.840]   I'm going to go via ask me.
[01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:07.280]   Ask. I knew I'd find that story.
[01:25:07.280 --> 01:25:07.440]   Yeah.
[01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:07.440]   Yeah.
[01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:08.160]   I'll follow.
[01:25:08.160 --> 01:25:08.400]   I'll follow.
[01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:08.880]   They're involved.
[01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:09.440]   It's your fault.
[01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:15.280]   I guess we're a cell phone provider, not a, not a miracle worker.
[01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:18.320]   That's my, that's my favorite line from the new Justice League trailer.
[01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:20.320]   And I'm pretty sure Josh Whedon wrote it when the flash says,
[01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:22.720]   I don't fight. I just push people and run real fast.
[01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:23.360]   That's what it seems like.
[01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:26.560]   So the trailer was interesting because there was no Superman in it.
[01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:29.520]   No, he's dead after the last movie Leo.
[01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:30.480]   Batman killed him.
[01:25:30.480 --> 01:25:32.160]   What are they going to do?
[01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:35.440]   He sacrificed himself to read the earth of doomsday.
[01:25:35.440 --> 01:25:35.760]   Okay.
[01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:37.760]   Yeah.
[01:25:37.760 --> 01:25:38.480]   But they got it.
[01:25:38.480 --> 01:25:40.720]   Well, I mean, they just, they did the Justice League with that Batman.
[01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:42.560]   Brian Singer filmed that movie already.
[01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:43.600]   So I guess I guess.
[01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:52.720]   Apple Music is going to host a live performance from Arcade Fire day after tomorrow.
[01:25:52.720 --> 01:25:55.200]   Is this the Apple Music Festival?
[01:25:55.200 --> 01:25:56.160]   Are they still doing that?
[01:25:56.160 --> 01:25:57.120]   What's happened with that?
[01:25:57.120 --> 01:25:59.680]   There was this time last year, wasn't it?
[01:25:59.680 --> 01:26:02.960]   I don't remember the timeline for it.
[01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:05.520]   I feel like Arcade Fire is, is that a Montreal band?
[01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:07.200]   I should be crucified for not knowing that.
[01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:12.800]   I think they still have, I think usually Apple Music festivals in, in September.
[01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:13.600]   Oh, is it in the fall?
[01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:17.360]   I believe it's in the fall and they, so they have a lot of experience in this area.
[01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:20.480]   It is really interesting to see how, how, how, how, how, how, how,
[01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:26.640]   Apple Music takes, you know, exclusive content development, you know, down, you know,
[01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:27.840]   how far they take this down the path.
[01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:31.840]   Well, and I'm sure it's a lost leader, right?
[01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:33.120]   Oh, yeah.
[01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:37.520]   All the money that they're not putting into Appworld, they can put into the App Planet.
[01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:38.880]   Did they, did they cancel?
[01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:40.400]   I haven't seen a second episode yet.
[01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:41.040]   I subscribed.
[01:26:41.040 --> 01:26:48.080]   They made at least four or five, but I think they're rethinking it now after the reaction.
[01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:54.400]   Apparently, Jeffrey Katzenberg has pitched Apple on a new TV service.
[01:26:54.400 --> 01:27:00.880]   He was the founder of DreamWorks, of course, in the power of the Disney's Renny songs.
[01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:01.600]   Yeah.
[01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:06.080]   New TV, he's gone also to Google and Verizon and a lot of other people,
[01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:10.240]   the proposal, which at Katzenberg says will cost $2 billion to launch.
[01:27:10.240 --> 01:27:14.800]   Chicken feed for Apple is centered around original short form content.
[01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:18.880]   It's just right for you, millennials, less than 10 minutes in length.
[01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:21.440]   The centennial is good.
[01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:23.920]   It's not even just the Lenny Olzer said.
[01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:26.000]   Like I have to admit, I'm now to a point where I'm like,
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:27.760]   I don't know if I have the energy to watch all of you.
[01:27:27.760 --> 01:27:29.280]   Nobody got time for Game of Thrones.
[01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:30.240]   You're like a nobody.
[01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:34.080]   But they said that Maestro and Alex Point knows this way, but I do.
[01:27:34.080 --> 01:27:38.000]   But mainstream television is really, so it's like series of snippets of 10 second
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:38.640]   interesting things.
[01:27:38.640 --> 01:27:39.920]   That's why they move around so fast.
[01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:42.080]   Game of Thrones has tons of storylines.
[01:27:42.080 --> 01:27:45.200]   So people never have to, they've got one for anything long as it's a good point.
[01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:46.160]   That's a good point.
[01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:46.400]   Yeah.
[01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:51.840]   My daughter, I turned it on to, I think it was, I was bouncing around looking for this
[01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:57.440]   documentary on keyboards and left it running.
[01:27:57.440 --> 01:28:00.320]   I think it was on the Smithsonian Channel or something like that.
[01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:02.240]   And it just changes every two and a half minutes.
[01:28:02.240 --> 01:28:05.520]   Like every two or three minutes, it's just like some snippet from their thing.
[01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:08.960]   And what's funny is it's the same, they use the same voiceover talent for all of them.
[01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:12.720]   So it's like the same guy talking over to them talking about keyboards,
[01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:16.240]   then talking about, you know, like I guess they must use him a lot.
[01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:17.760]   I think the sound of that channel.
[01:28:17.760 --> 01:28:18.400]   But.
[01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:21.920]   Well, then now you know why YouTube does auto play because they just keep going.
[01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:22.480]   Just keep going.
[01:28:22.480 --> 01:28:22.960]   Just keep going.
[01:28:22.960 --> 01:28:24.240]   She's quite happily stuck there and just watching.
[01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:28.160]   I don't think she would have ever watched any one of those things for more than two or three
[01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:32.080]   minutes, but she was quite happy to sit there and then it jumps to an inappropriate one.
[01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:33.200]   And suddenly you're racing.
[01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:38.720]   Well, that's when you know you're safe when you're not using, when you're not watching YouTube.
[01:28:38.720 --> 01:28:45.520]   I mean, you know, like, you know, it's, it's a, you know, and there was, um, uh, it was funny.
[01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:49.920]   I went to look at the, the, uh, rock and roll Hall of Fame, you know, the video, you know,
[01:28:49.920 --> 01:28:52.480]   that had, you know, this last one with Tupac and everything else.
[01:28:52.480 --> 01:28:56.000]   And yes was playing and, um, I guess we just want that video.
[01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:59.200]   My wife is sitting there and my, my, my eight year old daughter points up.
[01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:00.240]   He goes, is that a melodron?
[01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:02.880]   You know, she's like, and my wife was like, I don't know what the word drone is.
[01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:03.040]   Yeah.
[01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:03.200]   Yeah.
[01:29:03.200 --> 01:29:05.680]   She was like, but, you know, she was like, but yeah, Melodron.
[01:29:05.680 --> 01:29:06.320]   Don't you know that.
[01:29:06.320 --> 01:29:07.120]   Melodron.
[01:29:07.120 --> 01:29:08.080]   Melodron.
[01:29:08.080 --> 01:29:08.720]   Melodron.
[01:29:08.720 --> 01:29:09.520]   Everybody does that.
[01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:10.320]   What's that over there?
[01:29:10.320 --> 01:29:13.440]   We were talking about the mini move that was, uh, or mini-moke.
[01:29:13.440 --> 01:29:14.640]   She's like a synthesizer.
[01:29:14.640 --> 01:29:15.120]   That was a man.
[01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:18.720]   But you know, it's an hour of watching great video.
[01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:24.400]   We said last week that the Apple security was going to shut down drone videos.
[01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:26.320]   Maybe not.
[01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:30.480]   Don Knissenfeld is back with the late July update.
[01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:33.840]   Look at the landscaping on Apple Park.
[01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:35.840]   It is almost done.
[01:29:35.840 --> 01:29:39.920]   I still see piles of dirt and there's still a tarp over what we'll be doing.
[01:29:39.920 --> 01:29:40.400]   I would call it a pond.
[01:29:42.080 --> 01:29:43.600]   This is a nice sunset video.
[01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:47.520]   He's choosing the magic hour now to do his videos.
[01:29:47.520 --> 01:29:51.600]   I think he's choosing the security firms.
[01:29:51.600 --> 01:29:57.520]   After the security goes home, there's the disc.
[01:29:57.520 --> 01:29:59.120]   Well, they're actually almost-
[01:29:59.120 --> 01:29:59.920]   Steve Jobs' theater?
[01:29:59.920 --> 01:30:00.720]   Yeah, the theater.
[01:30:00.720 --> 01:30:05.280]   I still think that should be like a pop-up time or something where they push it down.
[01:30:05.280 --> 01:30:06.960]   Oh, it's a webcam.
[01:30:06.960 --> 01:30:07.440]   It's a webcam.
[01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:10.240]   Time for a new phone launch.
[01:30:10.240 --> 01:30:13.760]   Is this the secret R&D facility?
[01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:15.600]   No, I think that's Johnny's three-
[01:30:15.600 --> 01:30:16.400]   Even minutes are holiday-
[01:30:16.400 --> 01:30:16.720]   Oh, okay.
[01:30:16.720 --> 01:30:17.520]   Looks like a holiday in there.
[01:30:17.520 --> 01:30:19.760]   It does a little bit.
[01:30:19.760 --> 01:30:22.160]   I would want to be in the circle, not in the square.
[01:30:22.160 --> 01:30:25.440]   You don't want to be Paul in?
[01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:27.600]   You want to be Paul Williams?
[01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:28.720]   Set a square to block.
[01:30:28.720 --> 01:30:30.640]   Circle, guts the square.
[01:30:30.640 --> 01:30:32.240]   How?
[01:30:32.240 --> 01:30:36.800]   Yeah, notice he's on the top of the room.
[01:30:36.800 --> 01:30:39.360]   So, lucky he's flying over the road, not over there.
[01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:41.120]   Where are the coffee shops and bars?
[01:30:41.120 --> 01:30:42.800]   That's what I'm most interested to find out.
[01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:44.880]   Is this actually the campus?
[01:30:44.880 --> 01:30:46.960]   Because it looks like public streets.
[01:30:46.960 --> 01:30:47.840]   Yeah, those are public streets.
[01:30:47.840 --> 01:30:49.440]   So on the right, new buildings as well,
[01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:51.920]   but across the street from the circle.
[01:30:51.920 --> 01:30:53.840]   Well, remember there's a-
[01:30:53.840 --> 01:30:55.440]   It was a fitness center too, right?
[01:30:55.440 --> 01:30:55.680]   Yeah.
[01:30:55.680 --> 01:30:57.920]   It's interesting.
[01:30:57.920 --> 01:31:01.040]   It might be interesting to figure out what the security layout is like,
[01:31:01.040 --> 01:31:02.480]   because remember that they have to-
[01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:05.360]   in the Steve Jobs theater, for product rollouts,
[01:31:05.360 --> 01:31:09.440]   they have to have a way to get hundreds of people onto the campus and off-
[01:31:09.440 --> 01:31:11.920]   and control them and get them off the campus
[01:31:11.920 --> 01:31:14.400]   without giving them access to places they're not supposed to be.
[01:31:14.400 --> 01:31:16.560]   I'm looking for places to hide in the trees.
[01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:23.360]   So if I'm getting that campus, I'm never leaving, Andy.
[01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:24.400]   I'm never leaving.
[01:31:24.400 --> 01:31:26.320]   They're not kicking me out again.
[01:31:26.320 --> 01:31:30.080]   You know, there might be a way,
[01:31:30.080 --> 01:31:32.400]   like before they finish laying everything out,
[01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:35.920]   it's like if you can like renumber them so that there's a-
[01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:38.000]   if you just like paper over one of the doors
[01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:39.840]   and make sure that goes from like number
[01:31:39.840 --> 01:31:43.680]   office 112 to 113 without ever getting to in the beginning there,
[01:31:43.680 --> 01:31:47.920]   you could sort of like be the phantom of the spaceship campus.
[01:31:47.920 --> 01:31:49.600]   And I better be nine or 10 years,
[01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:53.520]   as long as you can like live off of whatever insects fly around.
[01:31:53.520 --> 01:31:55.680]   I think it could be done.
[01:31:55.680 --> 01:31:57.040]   I like it.
[01:31:57.040 --> 01:31:58.080]   I like the idea.
[01:31:58.080 --> 01:31:59.440]   There has to be a hallway to-
[01:31:59.440 --> 01:32:00.240]   a project that big.
[01:32:00.240 --> 01:32:02.000]   There has to be a hallway that goes nowhere.
[01:32:02.400 --> 01:32:05.600]   Like remember the the love lounge and picks our-
[01:32:05.600 --> 01:32:05.600]   Yes.
[01:32:05.600 --> 01:32:07.600]   Our little room.
[01:32:07.600 --> 01:32:07.840]   Yeah.
[01:32:07.840 --> 01:32:08.400]   Yeah.
[01:32:08.400 --> 01:32:09.680]   That's like it wasn't-
[01:32:09.680 --> 01:32:10.240]   they had a shut.
[01:32:10.240 --> 01:32:13.200]   They had a wallet off because they thought they knew they didn't need it.
[01:32:13.200 --> 01:32:15.200]   And then at some point someone says,
[01:32:15.200 --> 01:32:17.600]   "Gee, this vet looks almost big enough to crawl through."
[01:32:17.600 --> 01:32:18.560]   It was like, "Oh my God."
[01:32:18.560 --> 01:32:22.320]   There's an anti-chamber in my office.
[01:32:22.320 --> 01:32:23.760]   John Moggivitch's mind.
[01:32:23.760 --> 01:32:24.560]   All right.
[01:32:24.560 --> 01:32:24.720]   Yeah.
[01:32:24.720 --> 01:32:25.920]   I think this looks a little-
[01:32:25.920 --> 01:32:28.880]   curtail.
[01:32:28.880 --> 01:32:31.760]   I suspect he wasn't able to get as much access.
[01:32:31.760 --> 01:32:33.120]   It wasn't in the no-fly, La Porte.
[01:32:33.120 --> 01:32:33.920]   It was not in the no-fly.
[01:32:33.920 --> 01:32:34.480]   Yeah.
[01:32:34.480 --> 01:32:35.040]   Yeah.
[01:32:35.040 --> 01:32:39.440]   And suddenly the rock in an arm carrier appears-
[01:32:39.440 --> 01:32:42.720]   a jig of dust being a shouldering missile.
[01:32:42.720 --> 01:32:46.000]   He just jumps and tackles it out of the air.
[01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:47.760]   Let us take a break.
[01:32:47.760 --> 01:32:50.960]   He just arches an eyebrow in the shockwave from the eyebrow arches.
[01:32:50.960 --> 01:32:52.320]   They were joking before-
[01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:55.280]   and like someone is trying to market a product for-
[01:32:55.280 --> 01:32:57.680]   for Pokemon Go where it's a drone that extends your reach.
[01:32:57.680 --> 01:32:58.480]   So that if you don't-
[01:32:58.480 --> 01:32:59.600]   if you don't want to walk down that street,
[01:32:59.600 --> 01:33:01.520]   you can fly your drone and fight the gym.
[01:33:01.520 --> 01:33:04.160]   And I was just wondering if like another player's drone will
[01:33:04.160 --> 01:33:06.400]   knock yours out of the sky and then you have to-
[01:33:06.400 --> 01:33:07.840]   drone wars everywhere.
[01:33:07.840 --> 01:33:09.120]   That's a brilliant idea.
[01:33:09.120 --> 01:33:10.160]   I'd buy that drone.
[01:33:10.160 --> 01:33:12.720]   Boys, this is close.
[01:33:12.720 --> 01:33:13.280]   Like to the-
[01:33:13.280 --> 01:33:14.640]   you know, and I can't-
[01:33:14.640 --> 01:33:16.960]   you know, are you just too far away to-
[01:33:16.960 --> 01:33:17.200]   Yeah.
[01:33:17.200 --> 01:33:18.720]   That's like-
[01:33:18.720 --> 01:33:20.320]   already,
[01:33:20.320 --> 01:33:23.680]   already instead of like going off and engaging with reality,
[01:33:23.680 --> 01:33:28.160]   you need to engage with fake monsters that don't even exist in real life.
[01:33:28.160 --> 01:33:31.440]   Now you can't be bothered to leave your house to chase the fake monster.
[01:33:31.600 --> 01:33:33.280]   So you need a machine to chase those for you.
[01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:33.840]   No, but they were-
[01:33:33.840 --> 01:33:34.720]   They were saying that.
[01:33:34.720 --> 01:33:35.120]   They were saying like-
[01:33:35.120 --> 01:33:35.760]   You know-
[01:33:35.760 --> 01:33:37.920]   It's like maybe you need a moment of self-examination.
[01:33:37.920 --> 01:33:38.720]   That's all I'm asking.
[01:33:38.720 --> 01:33:39.280]   That's all I'm saying.
[01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:40.160]   They're saying like at first,
[01:33:40.160 --> 01:33:41.440]   if like you hear this in your Pokemon,
[01:33:41.440 --> 01:33:42.880]   you'll do any like you'll spend a week,
[01:33:42.880 --> 01:33:44.720]   you'll go anywhere to try to get it.
[01:33:44.720 --> 01:33:46.000]   And then you really want to get a good one
[01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:47.600]   and you stop getting the ones that aren't good.
[01:33:47.600 --> 01:33:50.080]   And then like eventually it's across the road and-
[01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:51.760]   I'm not going to cross the road to get that.
[01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:54.480]   It's like the five stages of weaning off of any of these things.
[01:33:54.480 --> 01:33:56.480]   We're going to take a break.
[01:33:56.480 --> 01:33:57.680]   Come back with your picks.
[01:33:57.680 --> 01:33:58.880]   Prepare your picks.
[01:33:58.880 --> 01:34:00.560]   Gentlemen and ladies and gentlemen,
[01:34:00.560 --> 01:34:02.800]   I want to tell you about Capeterra
[01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:05.200]   and a big milestone for Capeterra.
[01:34:05.200 --> 01:34:11.040]   Now 200,000 verified user reviews on Capeterra.
[01:34:11.040 --> 01:34:14.000]   Capeterra is the software search site
[01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:19.360]   that helps you find the right software for your business.
[01:34:19.360 --> 01:34:21.280]   I know, you know, if you're tasked with-

[01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:25.040]   we need to find the medical management software for our office
[01:34:25.040 --> 01:34:27.920]   or we need to find some educational software
[01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:29.680]   or some website building software.
[01:34:29.680 --> 01:34:31.440]   We need to keep track of customer service.

[01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:35.360]   What do you do? Do you just Google?
[01:34:35.360 --> 01:34:39.840]   No, you got to go to capeterra.com/macbreak.

[01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:48.000]   400 plus thousands.
[01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:49.920]   Look at it. From A/B testing.
[01:34:49.920 --> 01:34:51.760]   Let me see what's at the end.
[01:34:51.760 --> 01:34:53.600]   That's the A/B testing.
[01:34:53.600 --> 01:34:56.000]   Let me go all the way to the end of the alphabet here.
[01:34:57.120 --> 01:34:59.040]   Actually, I don't know if I can get that far.
[01:34:59.040 --> 01:35:02.800]   Scroll all the way down from A/B testing to
[01:35:02.800 --> 01:35:07.520]   what's the last yoga studio management software?
[01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:10.640]   You can find it all.
[01:35:10.640 --> 01:35:12.480]   Pick a category.
[01:35:12.480 --> 01:35:12.880]   Trucking.
[01:35:12.880 --> 01:35:14.800]   Let's say you're a trucking business.
[01:35:14.800 --> 01:35:16.160]   You need trucking software.
[01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:18.480]   You go to capeterra.com/macbreak.
[01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:22.400]   It will list all the different programs you can use.
[01:35:22.400 --> 01:35:23.040]   But wait a minute.
[01:35:23.040 --> 01:35:24.240]   You have some specific needs.
[01:35:24.240 --> 01:35:24.800]   Well, fine.
[01:35:24.800 --> 01:35:26.560]   Go over on the right and you can filter
[01:35:26.560 --> 01:35:27.280]   with the results.
[01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:31.760]   Let's only see four star rated with...
[01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:35.200]   It has to handle 10 to 50 users.
[01:35:35.200 --> 01:35:37.200]   You want a web baster on your hard drive.
[01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:38.480]   Let's make it web-based.
[01:35:38.480 --> 01:35:39.760]   Does it handle dispatch?
[01:35:39.760 --> 01:35:40.080]   Yeah.
[01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:41.760]   We need mileage tracking.
[01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:42.080]   Yeah.
[01:35:42.080 --> 01:35:43.040]   We need scheduling.
[01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:43.360]   All right.
[01:35:43.360 --> 01:35:44.320]   Let's filter the results.
[01:35:44.320 --> 01:35:46.960]   Now we're going to narrow it down to programs.
[01:35:46.960 --> 01:35:50.400]   26 of them just right for you.
[01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:51.440]   Then add them.
[01:35:51.440 --> 01:35:53.120]   Click the box here to compare.
[01:35:53.680 --> 01:35:56.880]   You can add up to four programs to the comparison chart.
[01:35:56.880 --> 01:35:58.720]   So we've added all four programs.
[01:35:58.720 --> 01:36:00.800]   And now I'm going to have a comparison chart
[01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:03.520]   that will show me the four programs I'm interested in.
[01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:05.920]   Their ratings, all the features,
[01:36:05.920 --> 01:36:11.520]   where it runs the costs, and of course user reviews,
[01:36:11.520 --> 01:36:14.560]   verified reviews from actual users.
[01:36:14.560 --> 01:36:15.520]   You got to love it.
[01:36:15.520 --> 01:36:21.600]   This is capeterra.com/capterra.com.
[01:36:21.600 --> 01:36:22.640]   You know what I love the best?
[01:36:23.520 --> 01:36:25.520]   It's absolutely free.
[01:36:25.520 --> 01:36:26.560]   There's no sign up.
[01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:29.280]   They're not going to call you.
[01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:30.320]   It's just free.
[01:36:30.320 --> 01:36:34.000]   Power up your productivity with the right business software.
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:35.840]   Where do you even start?
[01:36:35.840 --> 01:36:39.920]   I start at capeterra.com/macbreak.
[01:36:39.920 --> 01:36:42.240]   C-A-P-T-E-R-R-A.
[01:36:42.240 --> 01:36:43.200]   You don't need to register.
[01:36:43.200 --> 01:36:44.480]   There's absolutely no obligation.
[01:36:44.480 --> 01:36:47.360]   You won't get annoying follow-up emails or phone calls.
[01:36:47.360 --> 01:36:51.120]   Just the information you need to find the business software
[01:36:51.120 --> 01:36:52.080]   that's right for you.
[01:36:52.880 --> 01:36:55.200]   Capeterra.com.
[01:36:55.200 --> 01:36:57.040]   And congratulations to Capeterra.
[01:36:57.040 --> 01:37:00.480]   They just broke 200,000 software reviews.
[01:37:00.480 --> 01:37:03.840]   And there's more coming in all the time.
[01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:06.560]   Capeterra.com/macbreak.
[01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:08.000]   Don't Google it.
[01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:08.880]   Capeterra it.
[01:37:08.880 --> 01:37:12.800]   Annie and Aco, time for your pick of the week, my friend.
[01:37:12.800 --> 01:37:16.080]   Oh, I've got a new favorite app in the world.
[01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:17.280]   For the past several months,
[01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:19.520]   I've taken it upon myself to finally
[01:37:20.160 --> 01:37:27.120]   organize my music library with the MP3s that I've had since 1994, 1995,
[01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:30.080]   all the way up to the stuff that I've been ripping last week.
[01:37:30.080 --> 01:37:30.880]   And you know how it is.
[01:37:30.880 --> 01:37:33.920]   It's like you ripped half of an album and you didn't rip the rest of it.
[01:37:33.920 --> 01:37:36.560]   And maybe you put the wrong art on one.
[01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:40.800]   And then also there are people who contribute to the CD database
[01:37:40.800 --> 01:37:41.840]   aren't demented.
[01:37:41.840 --> 01:37:43.840]   I mean, if you want to know that happens all it's on.
[01:37:43.840 --> 01:37:45.280]   Oh my God.
[01:37:45.280 --> 01:37:45.920]   It's like.
[01:37:47.280 --> 01:37:50.240]   And also the great thing about having all your music
[01:37:50.240 --> 01:37:53.200]   organized is that you discover new ways to use it and enjoy it.
[01:37:53.200 --> 01:37:54.000]   And so.
[01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:59.120]   I found this app called Beattoons, B-E-A-T-U-N-E-S.
[01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:00.800]   And it's amazing.
[01:38:00.800 --> 01:38:06.320]   You launch it, you fire it up and it will look at your iTunes library
[01:38:06.320 --> 01:38:08.560]   or just folders of music that you have.
[01:38:08.560 --> 01:38:10.880]   And it will do a million things with it.
[01:38:10.880 --> 01:38:13.440]   Starting with housekeeping sort of stuff.
[01:38:13.440 --> 01:38:17.040]   Saying, well, this one is pulling its album art from iTunes,
[01:38:17.040 --> 01:38:17.840]   but it's not embedded.
[01:38:17.840 --> 01:38:22.080]   We like it to embed the art inside the mp3 file or the music file.
[01:38:22.080 --> 01:38:24.160]   And stuff like this is where.
[01:38:24.160 --> 01:38:28.800]   If my hatred of a person I've never met could kill them.
[01:38:28.800 --> 01:38:32.080]   This is where it would be lethal when you have an album by Adele
[01:38:32.080 --> 01:38:37.280]   and there are 18 tracks with Adele and there's one track where she's doing
[01:38:37.280 --> 01:38:39.120]   like a duet with Bono and so on.
[01:38:39.120 --> 01:38:42.080]   So it's, oh, this must be a compilation of various artists that no,
[01:38:42.080 --> 01:38:43.440]   it's not a compilation.
[01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:46.000]   It's an Adele album with one duet on it.
[01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:47.200]   I hate it when that happens.
[01:38:47.200 --> 01:38:47.680]   Yeah.
[01:38:47.680 --> 01:38:51.840]   So we'll do all this analysis and say, okay, well, this is flagged as a compilation,
[01:38:51.840 --> 01:38:53.200]   but it's all the same artists.
[01:38:53.200 --> 01:38:56.400]   Would you like us to unflag that as a compilation?
[01:38:56.400 --> 01:39:01.520]   I can't list all the things that will do to fix problems in your database.
[01:39:01.520 --> 01:39:04.320]   Not just duplicate tracks and stuff like that,
[01:39:04.320 --> 01:39:06.560]   but it will do incredible stuff like that.
[01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:10.640]   But let's assume that your library is in good, Nick, to begin with.
[01:39:10.640 --> 01:39:13.680]   It will also analyze the content of your songs
[01:39:13.680 --> 01:39:17.760]   to allow you to really understand relationships between music better.
[01:39:17.760 --> 01:39:20.480]   So a lot of apps will do beats per minute.
[01:39:20.480 --> 01:39:23.280]   So if you like to exercise, like I'm now trying to do,
[01:39:23.280 --> 01:39:25.600]   it was called Cadence Training on my bike,
[01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:29.840]   where it's like you're trying to never get less, fewer than 80 revolutions
[01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:32.320]   per minute on the cranks and never get more than 90.
[01:39:32.320 --> 01:39:35.760]   And so I'm looking for music that is between 80 and 90 beats per minute.
[01:39:35.760 --> 01:39:40.160]   So yes, it will show you, it will analyze the beats per minutes of all your tracks.
[01:39:40.160 --> 01:39:43.520]   But it will also do things like assign what it calls a color.
[01:39:43.520 --> 01:39:44.560]   So it will analyze it.
[01:39:44.560 --> 01:39:49.280]   And so all it means is that like all the red songs,
[01:39:49.280 --> 01:39:51.200]   it doesn't, the red doesn't really mean anything,
[01:39:51.200 --> 01:39:53.600]   but it means that if you've got 80 red songs,
[01:39:53.600 --> 01:39:55.120]   they are all similar to each other.
[01:39:55.120 --> 01:39:58.320]   And they will probably harmonize with each other very well in a playlist.
[01:39:58.320 --> 01:40:01.680]   Or you can, it's on and on and on.
[01:40:01.680 --> 01:40:06.320]   I can either stop talking after 30 seconds or I can go on for 20 minutes.
[01:40:06.320 --> 01:40:11.440]   The number of ways that this has allowed me to see relationships between the tracks
[01:40:11.440 --> 01:40:17.120]   that I have to fix problems that are deep, deep, and disturbing in my library database.
[01:40:17.120 --> 01:40:24.080]   And also find out new ways to build new playlists that allow me to really enjoy music from places
[01:40:24.080 --> 01:40:28.000]   that I try to rip entire CDs now.
[01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:29.600]   I don't leave anything behind.
[01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:33.680]   But there are always those tracks you never listen to because they're just not the hits,
[01:40:33.680 --> 01:40:36.560]   or they're just kind of deep, deep, deep on the album.
[01:40:36.560 --> 01:40:42.560]   But this will say, well, here are 81 songs that are pink with sort of mauvish overtones.
[01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:45.760]   And so, okay, give me a playlist with 20 of those songs.
[01:40:45.760 --> 01:40:51.120]   And it's the most beautifully malefluous, like, it's like a concept album because it looks like
[01:40:51.120 --> 01:40:55.120]   it was all written by the same person with the same mindset, even though you're talking about
[01:40:55.120 --> 01:40:57.520]   music that's spanning 60 or 70 years.
[01:40:57.520 --> 01:40:59.840]   And on top of all that, it's a pretty good music player in and of itself.
[01:40:59.840 --> 01:41:04.720]   If you've been sort of frustrated by how iTunes works, it will work as a nice music player.
[01:41:04.720 --> 01:41:12.800]   It will, if you want to make changes to your iTunes database, but you can also have it create,
[01:41:12.800 --> 01:41:18.000]   I think, its own library so you can sort of have it as its own special little music player.
[01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:22.720]   I was writing it in sort of suspicious mode for the first week.
[01:41:22.720 --> 01:41:26.880]   But after seeing the results it was getting, I was more than happy after making a full and
[01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:29.600]   complete backup of my music library.
[01:41:29.600 --> 01:41:35.120]   To have B-tunes apply all these things so that now all this information is tagged within the
[01:41:35.120 --> 01:41:40.320]   music files themselves. So even if I do put it into iTunes, even if I do put it into a third-party
[01:41:40.320 --> 01:41:43.920]   music player on another platform, I will get all the benefits of this stuff.
[01:41:43.920 --> 01:41:49.120]   It's not a cheap app, it's 35 bucks, but it's free for I think the first 14 days.
[01:41:49.120 --> 01:41:53.600]   And I'm talking about free free, not only the first 80 songs.
[01:41:53.600 --> 01:41:58.160]   I mean, it was grounding at thousands and thousands of songs in my library for days and days and days
[01:41:58.160 --> 01:42:03.680]   on end. But I think it's eminently worth 35 bucks. It's beautifully made. It does something that I
[01:42:03.680 --> 01:42:09.840]   don't see any other app doing. And I keep coming back to the fact that there was joy hidden inside
[01:42:09.840 --> 01:42:16.240]   my music library that I was unaware of until B-tunes showed it to me. So that's worth 35
[01:42:16.240 --> 01:42:17.760]   damn bucks of anybody's money.
[01:42:17.760 --> 01:42:21.520]   I'm going to run out and get this. This looks amazing. It's been around for 10 years. I don't
[01:42:21.520 --> 01:42:26.800]   know how I haven't heard of it. And it sounds the other thing I like, which is you especially
[01:42:26.800 --> 01:42:31.040]   hear about a legendary good piece of software. Oh, the last updated 2013.
[01:42:31.040 --> 01:42:36.400]   Okay. I'll go compatible with iOS 10.6. But no, the last update was just like two or three weeks
[01:42:36.400 --> 01:42:42.640]   ago. So it's a very, very active. I think that's partly why you appreciate them charging $35.
[01:42:42.640 --> 01:42:46.480]   Like a decent amount of money for a really great app. I think that's the reason why they've been
[01:42:46.480 --> 01:42:50.880]   around for so long. That's the reason why they keep updating it because hopefully this app
[01:42:50.880 --> 01:42:53.120]   allows them to pay themselves a decent wage.
[01:42:53.120 --> 01:42:58.640]   You get the feeling it's one guy. I keep hearing in the blog, it says, I, I, I,
[01:42:58.640 --> 01:43:04.640]   I'd love to love to know more about who's behind this. It looks like this has been a labor of love
[01:43:04.640 --> 01:43:09.760]   for some time. And there's a lot of parts. Yeah. It's a plug-in API and all sorts of
[01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:13.840]   I can't wait to try it. Thank you for the suggestion. Great. Great. Great. Great. Pick.
[01:43:13.840 --> 01:43:16.880]   B-e-a-t-u-n-e-s.com.
[01:43:16.880 --> 01:43:22.400]   Renee Richie, you pick it a week, sir. Well, first, I want to apologize. There were a lot of great
[01:43:22.400 --> 01:43:26.480]   Twitch and Mac Break weekly fans at Pokemon Go Fest who came up and set a line,
[01:43:26.480 --> 01:43:29.520]   set a low and gave their best to everybody here. And I forgot to thank them for that.
[01:43:29.520 --> 01:43:32.720]   Very good. That was terrific. It was great seeing them and their kids and, and, you know,
[01:43:32.720 --> 01:43:37.360]   everybody with them. And the, all the bonuses from the event that were unlocked, they last night,
[01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:40.800]   they extended them for another three days where everyone has until Thursday now to get
[01:43:40.800 --> 01:43:44.960]   double experience, double stardust, double candy, double everything, basically. So
[01:43:44.960 --> 01:43:49.680]   if you're playing, keep playing. My pick of the week is because RIP flash, you know,
[01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:54.560]   web still needs to be authored. I'm sorry, interactive content still needs to be made.
[01:43:54.560 --> 01:43:58.560]   And now we have HTML and Canvas and all these great, you know, CSS transformologies, great
[01:43:58.560 --> 01:44:03.760]   technologies to do it with. But most of us don't want to code that in math. So there are apps
[01:44:03.760 --> 01:44:08.560]   that are really great authoring. Adobe has its own authoring suite for HTML5. But
[01:44:08.560 --> 01:44:13.360]   hype has always been one of my favorites. It was formed by two Apple employees after they left
[01:44:13.360 --> 01:44:17.440]   the company, Jonathan Deutsch and Ryan Nielsen. Ryan Nielsen has gone back, but Jonathan Deutsch
[01:44:17.440 --> 01:44:23.760]   is still there, still working on it. It's made by Tumult. It's a fantastic app. It just lets you
[01:44:23.760 --> 01:44:27.920]   create what you'd expect to create in Flash, especially if you go back to the early days of
[01:44:27.920 --> 01:44:33.040]   macro media and you remember how you would build things and create timelines for them and animations
[01:44:33.040 --> 01:44:38.560]   and transforms and everything. And Tumult's hype lets you do that. And it's all converted into HTML
[01:44:38.560 --> 01:44:43.600]   5 coding and then you can deploy it just as you would deploy any website. And it creates beautiful,
[01:44:43.600 --> 01:44:49.600]   interactive, really good looking pages. And I've been a huge fan of theirs since they started.
[01:44:49.600 --> 01:44:57.600]   So this is all HTML5. It doesn't interest it. Yeah. And again, if you were used to building
[01:44:57.600 --> 01:45:03.040]   with Flash, I think in some ways it's made better choices. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. And it just,
[01:45:03.040 --> 01:45:07.680]   it looks gorgeous. And it performs well because you're not using a plugin, you're using all the
[01:45:07.680 --> 01:45:12.480]   native and a lot of browsers are accelerated. So you get all the advantages of writing native
[01:45:12.480 --> 01:45:20.800]   content. This looks great too. Wow. It's absolutely terrific. So Tumult T-U-M-U-L-T.com and the program
[01:45:20.800 --> 01:45:29.920]   is called hype, H-Y-P-E. They have hype three and hype pro and hype reflect. Yeah. All kinds of hype.
[01:45:29.920 --> 01:45:33.200]   People want people want more hype. Can't believe the hype in this case you can.
[01:45:33.200 --> 01:45:39.600]   T-U-M-U-L-T dot. And it's just a great group of people making it too. Nice. Nice. All right.
[01:45:39.600 --> 01:45:46.000]   We've saved the best for last, at least the most expensive. Alex Lindsey? No? No? No? I don't think so.
[01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:51.760]   So the one of the things that we're running into and we're doing a lot of AR and VR research
[01:45:51.760 --> 01:45:58.640]   right now and most of it right now has been in Unity. Unity3D.com and Unity is kind of,
[01:45:58.640 --> 01:46:04.320]   it's Unity Unreal Engine are really the two platforms that almost everybody's building
[01:46:04.320 --> 01:46:10.000]   VR and AR experiences. And we haven't had a ton of experience with Unreal. We understand that
[01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:15.200]   there are some advantages of particle systems and some other rendering advantages. But so far,
[01:46:15.200 --> 01:46:19.760]   we've done a lot of work in Unity3D and we're really happy with it. And one thing that a lot of people
[01:46:19.760 --> 01:46:26.000]   tweet towards me or email me or send things is, how can I get into the industry or how can I get
[01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:30.960]   into the next thing? I'm looking for my next job. I would definitely suggest checking out Unity.
[01:46:32.560 --> 01:46:38.720]   I'm just, as we look down the path of a lot of these platforms, as we look down in the fall
[01:46:38.720 --> 01:46:45.040]   and look into the demand, among a lot of people that I know that are in this industry,
[01:46:45.040 --> 01:46:54.080]   the demand for Unity developers, far, far, far outstrips the supply. And so, and it's free to get into,
[01:46:54.080 --> 01:46:59.120]   you can download a version that is, I think, has almost all the features in it for almost nothing
[01:46:59.120 --> 01:47:03.200]   in the rest of them are. It's still a pretty low subscription rate to get into, but you can definitely
[01:47:03.200 --> 01:47:06.640]   get into it. And there's tons of learning materials. There's stuff on lynda.com. There's
[01:47:06.640 --> 01:47:11.600]   tons of other online courses that you can take. Our guys jumped into it and jumped into it and
[01:47:11.600 --> 01:47:16.080]   didn't take them very long to be publishing stuff on your phone,
[01:47:16.080 --> 01:47:22.720]   showing little AR things on our tables, that type of thing. And so, it's a pretty straightforward
[01:47:22.720 --> 01:47:25.920]   process. There's lots of sample code. There's lots of other things that you can do there. So,
[01:47:26.640 --> 01:47:29.600]   if you're thinking about the next thing you want to do, or you're thinking about adding something,
[01:47:29.600 --> 01:47:35.680]   I thought it would be a useful thing to say that I would highly suggest checking it out and
[01:47:35.680 --> 01:47:39.600]   playing with it. It might be your next career. It's going to be a busy couple of years.
[01:47:39.600 --> 01:47:46.640]   Interesting. UNITY3D.com. And you're right. I see all of the AR kit demos that I see,
[01:47:46.640 --> 01:47:52.480]   many of them are done in Unity. So, it's obviously, it's just really easy to throw things together
[01:47:52.480 --> 01:47:59.280]   quickly and pop them up. And now, a lot of the stuff you saw with Apple was an Unreal Engine,
[01:47:59.280 --> 01:48:04.640]   was used on the Apple keynote. So, that's another one to look at. Our experience, so far, has been
[01:48:04.640 --> 01:48:09.360]   the Unreal Engine's little--the learning curve's been a little heavier. As we deal with it,
[01:48:09.360 --> 01:48:15.360]   the Unity 1 is much faster to get into. It's unsure whether either one will be a big winner or
[01:48:15.360 --> 01:48:19.920]   whether you need to know both or whatever. But AR, VR, kind of run on those two engines.
[01:48:19.920 --> 01:48:23.600]   And it's definitely worth checking out if you're looking at a career as a
[01:48:23.600 --> 01:48:29.120]   getting into college or getting out of college or long--college was long ago.
[01:48:29.120 --> 01:48:33.920]   And you're interested in this kind of thing. It's a pretty high demand industry.
[01:48:33.920 --> 01:48:36.000]   Looks like subscription is how you go.
[01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:40.000]   There was some amazing--some of the early games for the Oculus Rift--not that I'm sorry,
[01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:44.240]   the HTC Vive, where people who just took the engine and the parts that it included.
[01:48:44.240 --> 01:48:48.160]   And they made lightsaber battles and dungeon crawlers, and they were amazing.
[01:48:48.160 --> 01:48:49.920]   Yeah, yeah. It's pretty cool.
[01:48:49.920 --> 01:48:53.440]   Is the personal enough the free personal edition?
[01:48:53.440 --> 01:48:57.840]   To start with, absolutely. I mean, what you're really getting into on the larger ones is you're
[01:48:57.840 --> 01:49:02.960]   going to end up paying to support a lot more users. I mean, if you really turn it into an app,
[01:49:02.960 --> 01:49:07.120]   but the personal one's just fine to get started, to figure it out, to see if there's something you
[01:49:07.120 --> 01:49:11.280]   want to do, to see if you can build anything that you're interested in. There's no reason to go
[01:49:11.280 --> 01:49:16.000]   any higher. It just plays the Unity logo. And there's some limited--a couple other limited features,
[01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:19.520]   but there's nothing that's going to stop you from seeing whether this is a worthwhile thing.
[01:49:19.520 --> 01:49:21.760]   And then you can move on to something else if it makes sense.
[01:49:21.760 --> 01:49:26.800]   Cool. I like it that they offer a free personal edition. That's really great.
[01:49:26.800 --> 01:49:27.600]   It's a great idea.
[01:49:27.600 --> 01:49:31.280]   Fellas, we've come to the end of another gripping edition. Oh, I was going to do my pick. I forgot.
[01:49:31.280 --> 01:49:36.400]   I often skip picks, but I thought I'd mention this one because I've been looking for a good case
[01:49:36.400 --> 01:49:42.160]   for my iPad Pro. This is the 10 and a half inch. And Logitech--I think it was somebody in the
[01:49:42.160 --> 01:49:46.720]   chatroom who mentioned that Logitech has created something they call the slim combo. I got when the
[01:49:46.720 --> 01:49:52.880]   first iPad Pro came out, I got the Logitech keyboard. It was just so clunky and thick. I just decided
[01:49:52.880 --> 01:49:57.200]   to abandon it for Apple's smart keyboard. But I have been looking for something that covers the
[01:49:57.200 --> 01:50:05.680]   whole iPad and uses the smart connector. This is one of the few cases keyboard combos for the iPad
[01:50:05.680 --> 01:50:11.360]   Pro that uses that, you know, a Pogo pin smart connector on the bottom of the iPad. And I have to
[01:50:11.360 --> 01:50:19.040]   say it's a lower cost case. It's only 130 bucks compared to 160 for the Apple keyboard. It has a
[01:50:19.040 --> 01:50:25.440]   very nice physical keyboard. It's hard plastic. It's not a not a la contra or whatever Apple's using.
[01:50:25.440 --> 01:50:31.520]   The keyboard, which is really nice, is backlit, has all of the special keys that you need for the
[01:50:31.520 --> 01:50:37.920]   iPad. And the case itself has a loop for the Apple pencil. So you can keep that attached. I
[01:50:37.920 --> 01:50:42.400]   think it's a pretty nice case. You know, a couple of negatives one is that because it's detachable,
[01:50:42.400 --> 01:50:49.200]   just like the Apple smart keyboard cover, it kind of detaches and it's not the strongest grip ever.
[01:50:49.200 --> 01:50:52.800]   But that's I don't think that's anybody's fault. That's just how you have to do it.
[01:50:52.800 --> 01:50:58.000]   I do like it that instead of like with the smart keyboard, you have only one angle.
[01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:03.120]   And I always found that folding around the smart keyboard, you know, kind of complicated and at
[01:51:03.120 --> 01:51:10.640]   the same time kind of wanky. This has a hard plastic kickstand that can go pretty much any
[01:51:10.640 --> 01:51:16.320]   angle, including almost flat angle, kind of like the Surface Studio that I use here.
[01:51:16.320 --> 01:51:22.000]   So you can decide what angle you like best. And it actually works both in portrait and landscape
[01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:27.040]   mode. So if you want to, you know, watch something in portrait or do something in portrait, you can
[01:51:27.040 --> 01:51:31.360]   detach the keyboard and use the kickstand and it'll hold it up in portrait mode as well.
[01:51:31.360 --> 01:51:35.280]   So this I think for the price is probably I haven't tried them all.
[01:51:35.280 --> 01:51:43.520]   But this is my current favorite smart keyboard case for the iPad. It's Logitech's slim combo
[01:51:43.520 --> 01:51:47.280]   keyboard. I love it that it's back with. I think that's that's really, really handy.
[01:51:47.280 --> 01:51:52.960]   Have you tried this Renee? Sounds like you're I have not. It's you know,
[01:51:52.960 --> 01:51:57.120]   Trinity usually does the case review, but I like I like that use a smart connector. I like
[01:51:57.120 --> 01:52:00.320]   that it has a loop for the Apple pencil. Those are two things that are typically in high demand.
[01:52:00.320 --> 01:52:04.640]   I agree. I agree. And I don't know of a whole lot of cases that use a smart connector. A lot of them
[01:52:04.640 --> 01:52:12.160]   are designed for you to just use a Bluetooth keyboard comes in black and classical blue and
[01:52:12.160 --> 01:52:20.320]   $130 for the 10.5 inch version, $150 for the 12.9 inch version. I'm sorry, $129.99. But that's
[01:52:20.320 --> 01:52:25.200]   a I mean, that's 30 bucks cheaper than Apple's smart keyboard. And I would say it does everything
[01:52:25.200 --> 01:52:30.640]   the smart keyboard does. It's not made out of taffeta. It's not made out of taffeta. It's made out of
[01:52:30.640 --> 01:52:36.960]   hard plastic, but it's grippy. It's not as attractive as you carry that. It's nice. It looks it looks
[01:52:36.960 --> 01:52:43.360]   like a real full of folio. And I have to say, once you once you really becomes very laptop-like
[01:52:43.360 --> 01:52:48.720]   once you put the kickstand out, I don't know if I can show it to you, but I like I'll put it here.
[01:52:50.400 --> 01:52:56.320]   I think that's very highly functional. So anyway, my recommendation is slim combo till I find
[01:52:56.320 --> 01:53:02.000]   something better. We do back break weekly every Tuesday right after iOS today, 11 a.m.

[01:53:52.960 --> 01:53:58.560]   for having me. Welcome back from Chicago. Thank you. Andy Anaco from the Chicago Sun Times and his
[01:53:58.560 --> 01:54:05.120]   website CWOB.com. We didn't get to talk about that Motorola phone. You're in Boston for a briefing,
[01:54:05.120 --> 01:54:11.280]   I guess. Yeah, well, it was a small event, but yeah, so it's not that much. Is this a G and X?
[01:54:11.280 --> 01:54:20.240]   What is this? It's the Z2, I think. Oh, the Z2. Yeah, it's got the Pogo pins in the back and
[01:54:20.240 --> 01:54:26.320]   one of the features they've got is they now a 360-degree camera for this. You can attach to it for
[01:54:26.320 --> 01:54:32.560]   one of the other accessories they can do. What are all those cool stuff? They tried to take
[01:54:32.560 --> 01:54:37.600]   Android and do interesting things with it, but not the Samsung way, which is to say we decided that
[01:54:37.600 --> 01:54:41.680]   we could market this really well if we had them add with this feature in it. No, they're actually
[01:54:41.680 --> 01:54:46.240]   trying to move things forward. Cool stuff. At least they're continuing those smart backs, right? I mean,
[01:54:46.240 --> 01:54:55.520]   or not. Yeah, no, they're very, very much committed to it. I like it. It's a great idea. I just hope
[01:54:55.520 --> 01:55:04.960]   that they keep thinking of good things to do with it. I still, this is an Andy feature and I'll end
[01:55:04.960 --> 01:55:10.480]   this very quickly. I'm sorry. But an Andy feature is, oh, God, I would be so cool to have a phone that
[01:55:10.480 --> 01:55:15.600]   has a back that has a much better camera on it. They tried it when they first released this
[01:55:15.600 --> 01:55:20.880]   version of this phone with a hassle-blad back, but it took pictures that were far worse than
[01:55:20.880 --> 01:55:26.480]   whatever the internal camera did. But it's a great idea. Let's just hope that they, it's
[01:55:26.480 --> 01:55:34.800]   the relevance to our show is that anytime that any phone maker has a really great idea,
[01:55:35.120 --> 01:55:38.960]   it's an opportunity for other phone makers to figure out how they can make that relevant and
[01:55:38.960 --> 01:55:43.920]   how to improve their own products and it improves everybody's life. This is the Moto Z
[01:55:43.920 --> 01:55:52.560]   Z2 and August 10th. Is that what they said on that day? Yeah, it's taking pre-orders today and
[01:55:52.560 --> 01:55:56.320]   be available pretty much everywhere in the United States starting next week. And if,
[01:55:56.320 --> 01:56:01.760]   and they're the kind of excited to get people to buy these because if you buy one, I think you get
[01:56:01.760 --> 01:56:07.840]   a free like Pico projector back, snap on back. So you can actually be in this conference room and
[01:56:07.840 --> 01:56:13.360]   like be watching gun smoke in your conference room, so long as all the lights are off because
[01:56:13.360 --> 01:56:21.360]   these Pico projectors aren't really great for light. No, yeah, $500 unlocked. And then if you're
[01:56:21.360 --> 01:56:28.320]   at Verizon, I for some reason $408. Yeah, that's why it was weird. It's like the my
[01:56:28.320 --> 01:56:32.880]   list of questions was, okay, you just talk about for 30 minutes, you didn't say how much this costs
[01:56:32.880 --> 01:56:39.200]   like, well, because we got lots of carriers and ballpark $1,000, $8,000, $4.
[01:56:39.200 --> 01:56:43.680]   Not bad. And then of course, there's all these nice little backs.
[01:56:43.680 --> 01:56:50.240]   That's why I'm intrigued by the idea of saying we can't compete with these really,
[01:56:50.240 --> 01:56:55.760]   really good three, four, $500 phones and people who don't have $1,000 for phone aren't buying
[01:56:55.760 --> 01:56:59.840]   iPhone. So let's just go for broken, make the best $1,200 phone we can make.
[01:56:59.840 --> 01:57:02.720]   I've always liked the wood.
[01:57:02.720 --> 01:57:06.640]   I was like the wood backs. I'm gonna get one of our wood. Those are cool.
[01:57:06.640 --> 01:57:12.000]   Again, you can easily, they're like, they're like Renee with these Apple watches. I would own
[01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:16.720]   like nine of these backs. I feel like I'm in a bamboo mood. No, I'm I'm feel like I'm in a pirate
[01:57:16.720 --> 01:57:25.120]   leather mood. You just snap a coal. So they're giving, I gotta find where they're giving away
[01:57:25.120 --> 01:57:26.720]   the projector. I like that idea.
[01:57:26.720 --> 01:57:31.840]   That's it. That's a note from the from the briefing. I don't I don't have the actual details. Again,
[01:57:31.840 --> 01:57:37.680]   I came almost right from the from the briefing to hear. Right. By the way, not for sale in Germany.
[01:57:37.680 --> 01:57:42.800]   For some reason, we don't know. Can I kind of get a kind of, let's throw one piece of
[01:57:42.800 --> 01:57:47.360]   shape before we go though. I mean, a big deal about it's the thinnest phone we've ever made.
[01:57:47.360 --> 01:57:53.840]   Like, yeah, just don't look at the side that has this big camera. It's the size of a dime,
[01:57:53.840 --> 01:57:58.640]   which actually is the size of a nickel, which I don't I'm not ashamed of like camera bump
[01:57:58.640 --> 01:58:03.040]   buzz. But okay, just go easy on that. Is it a good camera though? I mean, if it's a good camera,
[01:58:03.040 --> 01:58:08.160]   that's okay. I would actually pay money for a camera bump on the MacBook. Yeah. I mean,
[01:58:08.160 --> 01:58:12.800]   for better. Well, it's it's twin lenses. I haven't actually I literally just took it out of the box
[01:58:12.800 --> 01:58:16.560]   while I was sitting down here for the show. And so I'll probably do some shooting with it in the
[01:58:16.560 --> 01:58:22.000]   limited time I had before I get my train home today. But a twin 12 megapixel camera is on the front
[01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:31.760]   there. Is this the Z two force? Yeah, I'm sorry. It's the Moto Z two force. Okay, so yeah,
[01:58:31.760 --> 01:58:36.880]   yeah, and that's the one. Yeah, and there is if there's a rebate for for that.
[01:58:36.880 --> 01:58:44.480]   That you get if you buy that Pico projector, there's a rebate, which is like $300. That's a good,
[01:58:44.480 --> 01:58:49.200]   that's actually a good deal. Yeah. Yeah. It's going in and can buy like really good speakers that
[01:58:49.200 --> 01:58:54.400]   only make it about double as thick. I like the idea of people who think that a speaker is
[01:58:54.400 --> 01:58:59.120]   ridiculous, don't have to buy it. But people like, no, no, I really like I walk around with my phone
[01:58:59.120 --> 01:59:04.240]   all the time and that would be so we'll see how it looks like you have to buy it not from Motorola
[01:59:04.240 --> 01:59:09.040]   directly, but through a partner to get the the rebate best buy has them. It's that they're
[01:59:09.040 --> 01:59:14.000]   really happy about how much you know, both of us in US, so good. I'm glad I want to see mobile
[01:59:14.560 --> 01:59:19.600]   Moto continue to succeed. I really like the Moto X and again, more people putting their own ideas
[01:59:19.600 --> 01:59:23.120]   in the phones makes their better consumers everywhere. So I'm all for it. All right.
[01:59:23.120 --> 01:59:28.160]   Hey, thank you, Andy. Thank you also, of course, to Alex Lindsey. He's at the pixel core pixel
[01:59:28.160 --> 01:59:34.960]   core.com. Follow him on the Twitter if you want to know what he's up to, a l e x l i n d s a
[01:59:34.960 --> 01:59:42.800]   why and I'll be in should be on the show, but I'll be on Pittsburgh next next week, visiting family
[01:59:42.800 --> 01:59:45.760]   and doing some work. So I'm probably going to do some kind of get together. So good.
[01:59:45.760 --> 01:59:52.160]   Excellent article on the in the New York Times about how Carnegie Mellon graduates are sticking
[01:59:52.160 --> 01:59:58.320]   around and turning Pittsburgh into the city, the place to be. You know, it's hard to get over the
[01:59:58.320 --> 02:00:02.800]   the sports culture and the I mean, like, you know, like steel town Steelers. You get kind of
[02:00:02.800 --> 02:00:07.040]   used to the Steelers and even the pirates don't make it to the world series, the it's a really
[02:00:07.040 --> 02:00:11.440]   nice baseball field and some great players with, you know, and fun to watch and then, you know,
[02:00:11.440 --> 02:00:14.640]   Pittsburgh doesn't have any of the stuff that you're used to. I mean, that you that you got used to
[02:00:14.640 --> 02:00:19.840]   when you think about Pittsburgh, there's no steel mills that's clean. It's there's great things to do
[02:00:19.840 --> 02:00:23.840]   there. There's my wife was actually kind of amazed when, you know, if you got there, she knew more
[02:00:23.840 --> 02:00:28.320]   about Pittsburgh by the end of our one year out there than I did, because she is a city girl. So
[02:00:28.320 --> 02:00:32.320]   she's like, there's art festivals and science centers and all these other things. And I was like,
[02:00:32.320 --> 02:00:38.720]   it's all the way in Pittsburgh, you know, it's a long way away from where we live. So anyway,
[02:00:38.720 --> 02:00:42.560]   so I'll be, I'll be there. I'm going to find a space to get together with whoever wants to get
[02:00:42.560 --> 02:00:47.360]   together. So awesome. Talk more about that later. Thank you, Alex. Thanks to all of you for joining
[02:00:47.360 --> 02:00:52.160]   us. Security. If you're watching live security now coming up in minutes, but for the rest of
[02:00:52.160 --> 02:01:01.360]   you back to work, because you know what? Break time is over. Bye.
