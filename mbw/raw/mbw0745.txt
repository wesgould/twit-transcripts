[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800]   Hello everybody, Leo LePort here. It's time once again for
[00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:09.000]   Mac Break Weekly's Best of 2020. One might think there wasn't much to talk about
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.700]   in 2020. Not a great year to relive and yet in the Macintosh world
[00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:19.300]   there are some amazing stories. Starting off with a terrible keyboard
[00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.000]   ending with a brand new chip and we're going to cover the best of 2020
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   next. All this year Mac Break Weekly has come to you from Twitt's

[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   This is Twitt.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   This is Mac Break Weekly, Episode 745 for December 22nd, 2020.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   Our year's best.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   Ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   Well hello! How are you? It's time for Mac Break Weekly's Best of 2020.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   And I can tell you this bottle was full at the beginning of the year and
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   it's been quite a year.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   But we did have a lot of fun with our Mac Break Weekly regulars Andy and
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   Nato Renee Ritchie, Lori Gill, Mac Break Weekly's Founder and
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   original member Alex Lindsay and of course a cast of many others who came
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   by from time to time. One of my favorite moments was right at the beginning
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   of the year, the Oscars this year. Apple had a little a cameo thanks to
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   director Tyke Tykawaka. Tyke Tykawatiti.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   I knew I shouldn't have had any of this.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Take it away Tykaw. Right after Tykawatiti wins an Oscar for best
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   screenplay for JoJo Rabbit. He goes backstage, gives a press conference
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   in which he announces he's got the world in his fingertips, the most
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   bully of all pulpits. What does he say? They ask him,
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   "What would you like the writers Guild of America to fight for?" He says,
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   "You gotta tell Apple. Those keyboards suck."
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Finally somebody's telling the truth at the Oscars.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   This is, it says he's joking. That sounds pretty serious.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   No, he's not joking. You're talking about a speech.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   He's a mad at thing. This is a good thing.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   This would have been great though if he did it in the Avengers where he's doing
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   the Quorg was going, "Thole, Thole, Apple's not making good keyboards anymore
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   Thole, can you have a talk with them?" And then Thorp put on the headset and talked to Tim
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Coke and said, "Listen, you make good keyboards.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   We'll all be over there and I'll shove this hammer."
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   Okay, and Tim would still say, "We have to be believed.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   This is the best compromise between..."
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   We have our customers love the playboard.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   I think it was the one useful thing that was said during the August.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   That's a huge, yeah the Oscars were horrible.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   But this is a huge black eye for Apple.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   And Apple, by the way, which is opening offices in Culver City along with
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   some of these other streamers because they want to be in Hollywood,
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   they had to be cringing on this.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Oh yeah.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   And yet, is there anybody who's willing to say that Tyka YTT was wrong?
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   But you could get a better keyboard.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   But you also want to point out how much dominance Apple has when he had to find
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   one person over on the side that doesn't use a Mac,
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   and they want to write everything that they do.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   If there's a silver lining, he's not willing to move to Lenovo ThinkPad,
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   which has a better keyboard. He wants to use a Mac.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   He didn't say, "I have moved over to a PC."
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   He said, "That's the bigger one of them."
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   He said, "I love Dell keyboards. That would have been a way better way."
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   We're all impressed.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   You're right.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   You've got to look at the silver lining there.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   I just can't imagine what it must have been like for those entertainment
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   journalists to hear that.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   They're cringing.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   They're talking about movies right now.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   They're cringing.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   What's going on?
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   They're probably not in their head because they're writing their articles on a Mac,
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   talking to screenwriters who all write everything on a Mac.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   So they're all these same...
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   But how about this? A dead spin.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   I also feel bad for the engineers at Apple who work on that keyboard,
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   because they're doing the best they can.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   I've complained as loudly as anybody else about it,
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   but I understand that this is somebody, some teams,
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   like this is what they do all day long.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   And just when they start to get some positive reviews
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   over the latest generation of their really bad idea for a keyboard.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   Now, again, this is all over the news because he didn't even see it as a quick
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   quick quip.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   And then let's talk about serious issues about the WGA negotiating for better,
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   for more rights and more respectability with studios.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   It's like, "No, I am on this.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   I thought I was just going to stop after one line,
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   but I've tapped into a deep-seated well of pain here.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   And you've got thousands of people nodding and saying, "Yes, I love you.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   I'm buying your t-shirt. I'm subscribing to your seminar."
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   So you don't like to be called out on a project that you work really hard on.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   You're doing your best on.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   I think honestly...
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   Andy, you're taking an empathy way too far on this one.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   I don't feel bad for the engineers.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   This is a problem.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   It couldn't be any way.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   Presumably, Apple is going to make all of the next laptops have.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   Because do we agree that the new 16-inch keyboard, at least, is usable?
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   Nobody asked him about that.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   Tyke, if you're listening, what TT, what do you think of the new one?
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   Have you...
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   You can afford to get to the new one.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   It's way too big a computer for him.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   No, but it's way too big a computer for him.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   Like a normal average writer.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   He wants an air.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   Yeah, an air or even a 13-inch.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   I mean, I don't think many people who are just writing want to carry a 16-inch laptop.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   Well, the new air, what do you think?
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   Well, they all have to be working.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   I'm really hoping because they hedged.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   They were hedging a lot about how they weren't abandoned.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   I don't know if that's just face-saving.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   Hedging about how Butterfly still has its place and it's still important.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   But this is, I think, more pro.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   Because there's no such thing as a more pro game.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   People write on smaller laptops.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   Those are pro laptops too.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   So my hope is that Magic Keyboard, all the things as fast as possible.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   And if they were holding any desire to keep the Butterfly keyboard on,
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   even for ultra thin new computers that they're working on,
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   I just hope they abandoned all those plans.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   I don't even know how you could write a whole script on the Butterfly keyboard.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   I can't wait a ton on it.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   You evidently did.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   But it's fine for me, but I don't like that other people hate it.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   If in the last act, your main character becomes an absolute psychopath and wants to kill everything in the world,
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   I think that would be an asset, but otherwise.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   No, I've written like 2 million words on those Butterfly keyboards and they don't bother me at all.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   But it is, like I said before, if other people don't like them,
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   if a large percentage of other people, there's no other manufacturer you can go to for a Mac laptop.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   So that is a complete deal breaker.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   You have to have a keyboard that maybe not every single person loves it,
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   but nobody has any problem with it whatsoever.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   I've had one.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   I got it right when it came out, the 12 inch or whatever.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   And just, you know, I could write notes on it and stuff like that.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   But I immediately was just like it became an extra laptop really quickly because it was just so.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   It drove me so crazy.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   Well, many of us ended up, you know, dragging our 2015 MacBooks.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   I still have this.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   And now I'm going to get this 2016.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   I just feel vindicated because Andy and I have been bitching about this keyboard for like a year, two years.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   And finally, you know, here's an Oscar winner actually taking the time in his press conference
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   where he's being congratulated for getting best original screenplay and that's what he's been saying.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   Some people talked about the climate.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   Some people talked about Trump. He took on an important subject here and talked about keyboard.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   Apparently, he learned that we're artificially in seminating cows.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   I didn't know that.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   So that's, you know, was Tim Cook there?
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   Like he was with Ricky Gervais?
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   I know that would be scary.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   Poor Tim had to sit through Ricky Gervais.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   I saw Jeff Bezos in the Oscar audience.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   I don't think Apple was nominated for anything.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   So there was no reason.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   Did you already said to Bezos that he thought the marriage story was fiction or something like that?
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   You know, it's like that.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   Well, at least he used his time in his Oscar speech on a problem that's actually capable of being solved.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   Something we can do so.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   You don't have to be a real cynic to think that we will never be able to figure out how to build a decent keyboard for a Mac book.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   Whereas, again, global warming, good luck, great grandkids.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   Sorry about the mess, but you're going to have to deal with it.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   I'm really Martin's comment that he didn't want to say anything bad about Amazon because he still wants to get his packages on phone.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   That was the best line in the old thing.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   Steve is a down to earth guy.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   He really means it.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   And why can't, why is anyone not hosting the Oscars?
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   Oh, because of Twitter.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   Did you read, I bet you did, because you seem like this kind of people.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   Apple's tech reports on the Mac Pro and the Mac Pro display XDR.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   You, you, of course, covered to cover, right?
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   I made so much coffee, Leo.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   I actually started, but I couldn't get very far.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   Renee, how far did you actually get in?
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   Oh, I read them.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   I read through them.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   I can't say I understood everything, but I read through them.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   There's so much technical jargon in there.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   Yeah, it's a PDF, which we will now proceed to do a dramatic reading of.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   [laughter]
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   So, introduction.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   Introduction.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   Make art a way to develop to the singular purpose.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   As you can see, the peak of the coffee red curve.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   You know what?
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   I would pay somebody to, like, audible this.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   Really?
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   I'll listen to it in the car.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   I wonder if Apple would get mad at me if I had to record it.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   Oh, you should do it.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   I will.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   Do it.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   What kind of voice do you do?
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   If they try to tell you to take it down, it would make it more popular.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   I think it should be dramatic.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   Remember to say Aluminium, Leo.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   Yeah, I'll say Aluminium.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   Up to 28 core.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   Intel Xeon W processor.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   [laughter]
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   Well, over six different drivebait.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   Oh, you can do this, Sean?
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   Oh, for perfect.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   He's expandability.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   He's going to do this, Sean.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   Connery version.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   We should do a whole bunch of versions.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   Oh, yes indeed.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   I'll do the Chewbacca version.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   [laughter]
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   [grunting]
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   What the hell is that?
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   Don Teddyback doing in the studio.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   Mac Pro?
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   His pro was designed to be the most demanding pro.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   What does design do do do?
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   What's happening right now?
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   No, you're not.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   This is all we have left, Laurie Gelt, please.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   Tell me, I'm a bit of a catch.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   So did you learn Renee anything from...
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   I mean, actually, if I had a Mac Pro, I would enjoy this.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   I'd print it out, tape it to the side.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   Did you learn anything that we didn't know?
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   I mean, there's just lots of detail.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.640]   Up until now, we were mostly getting information from people who bought them and either wrote
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:05.720]   about them on blogs or podcasted about them or YouTubeed about them.
[00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:07.320]   And they could make a lot of educated guesses.
[00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:10.480]   And some of them are really good educated guesses about what exactly Apple was doing.
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:13.800]   And while they don't totally open the kimono here, because Apple still doesn't explain
[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:18.720]   why they made the choices they made all the time, they do explain a lot of the underlying
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:19.720]   technologies.
[00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:21.240]   And it's pretty much what we expected.
[00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:26.360]   It is a miracle of engineering that applies to maybe 0.1% of computer users.
[00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:33.000]   You know, there is an expansion slot utility on the new Mac Pro that explains how to take
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.480]   advantage of the fabric, the switch fabric of PCI Express.
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:44.960]   I mean, I guess if you had a Mac Pro, if you're somebody like Alex who needs a lot of bandwidth
[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:48.120]   throughput, this would be useful to see and understand.
[00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:51.040]   When I'm working on his name, the scientist who did the review, Gruber Link, to it the
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:55.600]   other day, where he was doing modeling of wind simulations.
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:57.960]   And he said he used to take him like a room full of Mac Pros.
[00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:01.600]   He had to put a window air conditioner in the room just to be in the same room with
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:02.600]   them.
[00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:05.720]   And this ran and I forget what he said, but it was something like 14 hours on the Mac
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:06.720]   Pro.
[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:07.720]   Never got noisy.
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.600]   Fans never were annoying.
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:13.840]   And it was 28 cores and 900 and something gigabytes of RAM.
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:15.680]   And it did what a supercomputer used to do for him.
[00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:17.120]   So he was really happy with it.
[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:19.920]   But again, like that's the specific user that it was built for.
[00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:20.920]   Yeah.
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:28.040]   46 pages, including footnotes of this document is something that somebody who owns a Mac Pro
[00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.800]   and wants to get the maximum out of it.
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:30.800]   Or someone would want.
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:34.680]   Or someone looking at it or someone trying to sell it to their boss about why we should
[00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:35.680]   get it.
[00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:39.680]   Here's the paperwork to show that because what this is, is a communication to professionals
[00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:42.640]   that we didn't give up on you because there were a lot of us that were like, well, we're
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:46.720]   just going to go to PCs for everything because, and a lot of people have because they just
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:47.840]   didn't have the horsepower.
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:50.440]   The Mac Pro wasn't ever going to do that.
[00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:53.240]   The iMac, even the iMac Pro wasn't going to get there.
[00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:57.480]   And so a lot of people were looking at what happens after the Mac platform for them in
[00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:59.160]   the professional area.
[00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:01.080]   And now this says, hey, you don't have to go.
[00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:03.120]   You know, you're right because there is some sell in this.
[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:06.040]   Here's this paragraph from the display document.
[00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:07.040]   Yeah.
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:11.920]   The Pro Display XDR reimagines the potential of a reference display, overcoming many of
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:18.000]   the limitations and delivering incredible front of screen quality plus every feature requested
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   by Pro's all at an accessible price point.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   That's a little floor in where you're saying.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   Yeah, right.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.560]   But it also answers some questions because they were like people were conflating whether
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:32.240]   it was mini LED or regular LED and whether it was single layer or dual layer.
[00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:34.560]   And this just lays all of that out at least.
[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:35.560]   Yeah.
[00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:38.800]   You know, there are some benefits to doing Mac break weekly, of course.
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:44.080]   Well, one would assume that companies would like Apple would send us slews of products.
[00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:50.120]   No, that we would get access to some of the early betas of some really cool software.
[00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:54.400]   No, but we do get peanut butter.
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:14:01.040]   So the reason we were talking, Jeff, Jeff, gift, Jeff is because we have some peanut butter
[00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:02.040]   in the Mac.
[00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:03.040]   You actually got some?
[00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:04.560]   We got some peanut butter.
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:05.800]   He's been all over Twitter.
[00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:06.800]   Everybody's seen it by now.
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:13.680]   Actually, the company that makes Jeff JIF peanut butter actually spent, this is brilliant
[00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:15.360]   marketing.
[00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:21.200]   You can see it includes not only the peanut butter, but a special spoon, peanut butter
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:25.640]   spoon because that is actually how you're supposed to eat peanut butter on the one side
[00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:33.760]   they're normal label JIF creamy peanut butter, soft cheap pronunciation on the far side.
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:40.160]   And GIF animated looping images, hard G pronunciation and the gift you brand.
[00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:41.160]   They leave bread.
[00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:42.160]   Isn't this hysterical?
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:43.160]   It was an actual jar.
[00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:44.160]   Yes.
[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.920]   More than two pounds of peanut butter.
[00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:53.560]   And on the top, it says, if you've ever called a GIF a GIF, we forgive you.
[00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:55.760]   Now obviously they don't care, right?
[00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:56.760]   Okay.
[00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:57.760]   I do.
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:02.760]   I have to wonder what puts the bug up their nose to like like 18 years after this became
[00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:06.040]   this one thing to suddenly pull the trigger on this idea.
[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:09.160]   Because they finally hired someone that was less than 50.
[00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:10.160]   A millennial.
[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:11.160]   Yes.
[00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:12.160]   Yes.
[00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:13.160]   You nailed it.
[00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:15.160]   They got a millennial and I got an idea.
[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:20.200]   Is it also amazing that after all these years, we haven't replaced animated GIF GIFs with
[00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:21.760]   anything better to pick millennials.
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:22.760]   The flus.
[00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:23.760]   Right?
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:24.760]   You can do an animated ping.
[00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:25.760]   Yeah, it's just yeah.
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:29.440]   But the one uses them and GIF GIFs are still the cliche.
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:30.440]   People fire them off immediately.
[00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:33.240]   They're in Slack, they're in messages, they're on Twitter, they're everywhere.
[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:34.240]   I know.
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:35.240]   It's too bad.
[00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:36.240]   They're amazing.
[00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:37.840]   It's a terrible format, but it's really fun.
[00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:39.520]   It's encumbered for a long time.
[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:41.920]   There was this issue because it was created for CompuServe.
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:43.400]   CompuServe, yeah.
[00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:47.480]   But somebody else had the patent to the way the compression algorithm worked.
[00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:49.680]   So it was encumbered by this patent.
[00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:51.440]   And then I think there was a lawsuit.
[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:52.880]   I think that's been resolved.
[00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:54.680]   Well, patent only lasted certain.
[00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:55.680]   Yeah, but it doesn't.
[00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:56.680]   Yes.
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:57.680]   This is an ancient format.
[00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:58.680]   It doesn't.
[00:15:58.680 --> 00:15:59.680]   It doesn't.
[00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:02.560]   It doesn't actually compress very well.
[00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:06.360]   No, it's not a good one nowadays, but doesn't really know how to compress as well.
[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:08.440]   It's only 256 colors.
[00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:09.440]   I think it is.
[00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:17.480]   But I think part of the beauty of it is that it's rough and it's just short and it doesn't
[00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:18.480]   have any audio.
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:19.480]   That's a crap post.
[00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:20.480]   It's internet.
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:21.480]   It's not a crap post.
[00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:22.480]   Yeah.
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:26.680]   Well, no, it's a pre-took format because it works.
[00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:29.640]   We forget that it's nice to have things that are that like, you know, like, you know, like,
[00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:33.720]   our high tech and our high compression and have all the based on the latest research
[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:35.520]   and the latest algorithms and papers.
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:40.640]   But all we needed was we need to think it would be funny, particularly in social media,
[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:45.920]   to be able to respond to something by having that clip from return to the Jedi of Han Solo
[00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:47.720]   going.
[00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:49.440]   And it's a perfect format for that.
[00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:51.760]   Everything supports it as well understood.
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:55.560]   All you have to the built-in media players of every operating system supports it.
[00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:56.800]   No, no, no, no.
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:59.760]   Every operating system supports Ping.
[00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:03.720]   Ping is, is Ping everything supports animated pings.
[00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:05.720]   They're 24-bit, not 8-bit.
[00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:07.720]   They have 8-bit transparency.
[00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:10.080]   Do we need it?
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:11.920]   And how are you going to talk to everybody?
[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:12.920]   That's right.
[00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:14.320]   This is made it was better than VHS.
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:15.320]   Yeah.
[00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:16.320]   Yeah.
[00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:17.320]   Exactly.
[00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:21.240]   I also, I think I can't remember who what an actual, like, legitimate newspaper wrote
[00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:29.480]   about how the, that GIF as GIF, sorry, GIF has come into its, has come into
[00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:37.000]   recertancy because it is kind of the perfect format for like naughty video clips that,
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:42.160]   you know, if like, for the opening of Baywatch, you know, you just want to see like the clip
[00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:45.480]   of like the handsome buff men and women just like running in slow motion.
[00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:46.480]   You don't want to have to clip.
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:47.480]   You can say it Andy.
[00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:48.480]   Yep.
[00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:49.480]   There's no shame in Hasselhoff tech.
[00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:55.080]   Well, I don't, I have to, I don't know if this pecs have been recertified for, for, for
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:56.080]   social media yet.
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:18:01.680]   Backwards compatibility with non animated pings, simple to the code, the default image.
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:05.120]   There tend to be smaller, much smaller than gifts, but there are some.
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:06.120]   Full color space.
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:07.120]   Yeah.
[00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:08.120]   Full color space is 24-bit.
[00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:09.120]   I don't know.
[00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:15.560]   I can't, I think I, rather than this campaign, GIF versus GIF, which benefits only peanut butter.
[00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:21.000]   Why don't we have a campaign to get rid of animated gifts?
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.280]   I would argue that the young people aren't using them as much.
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:28.600]   It's kind of, it's kind of starting to get outdated.
[00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:32.880]   They're using, they're creating their own memes now and gifts aren't quite as, or ifs
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:35.840]   are quite as important as they used to be.
[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:37.160]   So you might get your wish.
[00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:40.000]   I think that they don't even know that they are gifts.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   True.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   Right.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.280]   I don't think they, like they're just the images that you insert into Facebook or they're
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:47.600]   the images that you insert into Messenger or whatever they don't.
[00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:49.920]   I don't think that they know that it is a thing.
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:51.920]   What format it is doesn't really matter anymore.
[00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:55.680]   It's just a, it's a link to a thing that does the thing.
[00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:56.680]   All right.
[00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:59.160]   Let's talk about Apple.
[00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:01.760]   He's in a bad mood now.
[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:02.760]   No.
[00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:05.120]   Can we put, can we put peanut butter on Apple?
[00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:08.040]   I have to say this, yeah, peanut butter on Apple is fixed.
[00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:12.200]   But they sent you a piece of, they sent you some peanut butter and we talked about it
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:13.880]   for like 10 minutes.
[00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:14.880]   Like that is amazing.
[00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:15.880]   Market.
[00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:17.880]   This is the second show we've talked.
[00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:19.600]   See, see, that's what I'm saying.
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:20.600]   More than their miles.
[00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:24.000]   The gg, the pixel 4, the Domino's pizza box, Tuleo, where you went on that one.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.640]   Whatever they're paying that marketing guy, not enough.
[00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:27.640]   Not enough.
[00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:28.640]   Not enough.
[00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:29.640]   Okay.
[00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:32.720]   Last, on Sunday, Twit was like three quarters COVID-19.
[00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:35.920]   I'm not going to do that to you, but there is some coronavirus news.
[00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:36.920]   We'll just give it to you.
[00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:38.080]   We'll get it out of the way.
[00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:39.720]   Very, very relevant this week.
[00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:40.720]   Yes.
[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:42.720]   Well, yeah, it's probably going to get a little relevant.
[00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:46.960]   Yeah, before it stops getting relevant.
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:50.720]   Bunch of stories in the Cofee V19 column.
[00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:53.080]   Tim Cook outlines measures.
[00:19:53.080 --> 00:20:01.120]   He sent an internal memo outlining measures that Apple's taking in response to the global,
[00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:03.920]   what may be a pandemic.
[00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:05.400]   Work from home.
[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:07.600]   He says, this is a challenging moment.
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:12.320]   Unpress it in an event, please feel what he told employees at several global offices.
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:14.720]   I imagine Italy is one of them.
[00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:17.640]   Please feel free to work remotely if your job allows.
[00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:18.640]   That's got to be tough.
[00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:22.280]   If your job doesn't allow, do you go in anyway and take a chance?
[00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:26.600]   Well, if your job allows, I think you get a large percentage of people able to work remotely
[00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:28.160]   for at least some period of time.
[00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:29.160]   Certainly.
[00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:30.160]   Coder's can work.
[00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:31.160]   The hard part, I think, is that it's not really...
[00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:32.160]   The design lab is hard.
[00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:33.160]   Yeah.
[00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:34.160]   It's culturally not.
[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:35.160]   Most people at Apple go into work.
[00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:36.880]   So it's a different culture.
[00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:37.880]   So his...
[00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:38.880]   Yeah, because...
[00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:42.280]   And I think this is something we discovered is that people who work at home often...
[00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:44.080]   Aren't doing much.
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:45.080]   It's hard.
[00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:46.080]   It's hard.
[00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:47.080]   It's hard.
[00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:49.080]   Sorry, Laurie, but it's true.
[00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:50.880]   No, no, it's not true.
[00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:52.680]   You just have the wrong people working for you.
[00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:53.680]   That's it.
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:58.520]   It does take a mentality, you know, I think to do it where you...
[00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:01.960]   I actually do more work at home because I'm not spending the time driving and I'm not
[00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:02.960]   spending...
[00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:03.960]   You know, and I work...
[00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:05.880]   I get up in the morning and start working and then I work all the way into the evening
[00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:10.760]   and there's all stops in the middle, but it's just a different kind of work.
[00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:16.800]   And also you have to be really good at being visible to the folks that you're working with.
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:21.120]   That's the problem is if we can't see what you're doing and there's no obvious output,
[00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:22.720]   then we just can't tell if you're doing anything.
[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:23.960]   My problem is they don't stop.
[00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:25.440]   Like, wake up, start working.
[00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:26.440]   Yeah, you're...
[00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:28.400]   Both of you, you and Laurie both have output.
[00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:31.400]   You've got vector, you've got articles, you've got editing.
[00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:32.400]   But if...
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:33.400]   If we were to see that...
[00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:36.880]   If we have a sales like my son, I'll use as an example who is working home on Fridays,
[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:38.120]   doing sales.
[00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:40.920]   You know, sales, there's no clear output.
[00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:43.160]   Either make sales or you don't.
[00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:44.160]   So that's...
[00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:45.160]   And I think that's...
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:46.160]   Anyway, this policy...
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:50.960]   I had a remarkable conversation where I was talking to an analyst and they said, "Well,
[00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:53.320]   start preparing for a baby boom because after a lot of...
[00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:55.840]   Oh, what do people do when they stay home?
[00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:57.320]   We have baby boom.
[00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:58.320]   So start getting...
[00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:00.320]   Start investing in all those package, consumer package goods.
[00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:01.800]   So I am the...
[00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:03.800]   I am the last baby boom.
[00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:05.120]   It was post-war.
[00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:06.120]   All the GIs came home.
[00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:08.720]   And suddenly there were a lot of babies nine months later.
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:11.280]   Then you're the Gen Xers, which were the next...
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:12.280]   Was that a boom?
[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:14.080]   They were the children of the booms.
[00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:15.080]   So they were...
[00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:16.080]   Yeah, so that was a little less...
[00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:17.080]   I was a...
[00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:18.080]   I was a Gen X.
[00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:19.080]   That was like the ripples coming off of the baby boom.
[00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:20.080]   Yeah.
[00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:21.080]   But yeah, this could be interesting.
[00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:24.920]   And then the millennials came from when Seinfeld ended and now people had nothing to
[00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:27.720]   do on Thursday nights.
[00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:30.120]   Seinfeld and Leno was a double win.
[00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:35.040]   So Cooks Mamo said, "This applies to corporate offices in the Santa Clara Valley where that
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:39.960]   is probably outside of Seattle, the West Coast's hot spot.
[00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:44.800]   Elk Grove, which is also in California, Seattle, South Korea, Japan, Italy, Germany, France,
[00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:47.480]   Switzerland, and the UK.
[00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:48.800]   Cook said Apple's making them...
[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:49.800]   This is interesting.
[00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:55.040]   A major effort to reduce human density and ensure those teams that are on site can do
[00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:57.360]   their work safely and with peace of mind.
[00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:04.720]   In other words, spread out because social distancing is another way to reduce infection.
[00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:10.080]   Apple's implementing "new efforts to maximize interpersonal space and continuing enhanced
[00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:13.360]   deep cleanings."
[00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:18.400]   Now one thing we didn't hear about is WWDC, although, and I don't know if this will be
[00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:27.160]   Jermaine, but apparently Santa Clara County, which is where Apple has banned mass gatherings.
[00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:28.160]   Well, they've...
[00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:29.960]   For now, it's a couple of weeks.
[00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:32.720]   On Thursday, was it a ban or was it just advisory?
[00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:34.280]   They released it along with...
[00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:35.280]   The ban was yesterday.
[00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:36.280]   Okay.
[00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:37.280]   That was...
[00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:43.520]   I know that on Thursday, they did a very, very long memo, basically not saying Apple, but
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:44.920]   saying Apple.
[00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:52.080]   We're encouraging large mass gatherings to be postponed or canceled.
[00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:53.080]   It's kind of a hint.
[00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:55.160]   I think it's only for two weeks, right?
[00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:56.160]   It's a short-term ban.
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:57.800]   They're going to reassess in a couple of weeks.
[00:23:57.800 --> 00:23:58.800]   Yeah.
[00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:01.240]   If the virus goes away in two weeks, they can have WWDC.
[00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:02.240]   Yeah, you know.
[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:03.240]   They can go away.
[00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:04.240]   Go away.
[00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:07.680]   Off the calendar and probably get Google I/O, which has already been canceled.
[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:08.680]   Yeah.
[00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:11.920]   Well, F8, Facebook's Developer Conference, Google I/O, Google's Developer Conference,
[00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:12.920]   both canceled.
[00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:13.920]   South by Southwest.
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:14.920]   South by Southwest.
[00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:16.200]   That was Austin saying we don't...
[00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:18.160]   We really don't want all those people coming down here.
[00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:19.160]   Right.
[00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:20.160]   And that's going to be disastrous for...
[00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:21.160]   I mean, a lot of these for...
[00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:22.160]   Well, that's the thing.
[00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:24.760]   It's a big economic hit for a city to take, but at the same time, what do you do?
[00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:25.760]   Well, it's not what you do.
[00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:28.400]   Say, "Oh, we need the restaurants business, but everybody can get sick.
[00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:29.400]   You can't do that either."
[00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:30.400]   No, no.
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:31.400]   I think it's hard.
[00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:35.920]   F8 has not... the conference that I go to probably more than any other one has not canceled yet.
[00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:39.080]   Vegas is not going to say, "Don't come to Vegas."
[00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:40.080]   Well, and I don't...
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:41.080]   Even if they should.
[00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:45.640]   My guess is the commitment for LVCC is between $10 and $20 million.
[00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:48.120]   And so they have to have LVCC release...
[00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:49.680]   That's Las Vegas Convention Center.
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:54.680]   Release NAB before NAB is going to be able to release the exhibitors.
[00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:55.680]   You know, like there's a...
[00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:56.680]   Otherwise, they'll know...
[00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:57.680]   It's like dominant NAB.
[00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:01.360]   So, you know, having people canceled, like so Ross has canceled, AJA has canceled.
[00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:03.520]   There's a bunch of other people that are not going.
[00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:07.600]   In fact, the Ross one is a 40 by 40 booth in the center of the South Hall.
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:08.600]   What's Ross?
[00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:09.600]   They've never heard of them.
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:10.600]   What do they mean?
[00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:11.600]   They're kind of between...
[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:12.600]   No, they'll hate...
[00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:15.480]   I'm going to get in a lot of trouble from Ross to say those, but...
[00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:18.720]   But they are between Blackmagic and Grass Valley.
[00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:19.720]   So Grass Valley is like the...
[00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:20.720]   So the little higher level...
[00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:21.720]   Super level.
[00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:22.720]   And then Grass...
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:24.520]   Then Blackmagic, a little lower in the Grass Valley.
[00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:25.520]   More expensive.
[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:26.520]   In price range, you know.
[00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:28.960]   And definitely there's a lot of feature sets that they have that are really good.
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:31.960]   They're usually considered like, "Oh, I can't afford a Grass Valley, so I'll..."
[00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:33.640]   You know, then they go Ross.
[00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:38.520]   And Ross has got really great stuff, but they're kind of in that niche.
[00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:39.520]   And they're really big.
[00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:40.520]   And they do a lot of infrastructure.
[00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:41.520]   How many people go to WWDC?
[00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:42.520]   Because Santa Clara says...
[00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:43.520]   It's like 100...
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:44.520]   I want to say 150,000.
[00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:45.520]   Okay.
[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:46.520]   So that's 20,000.
[00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:48.160]   That definitely is above the cap.
[00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:51.480]   They say anything more than a thousand people is banned.
[00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:52.720]   So that pretty much...
[00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:53.720]   WPC?
[00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:54.720]   Pardon me?
[00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:55.720]   There's 7,000 tickets.
[00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:56.720]   Wait, you see WWDC or NAB?
[00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:59.720]   WWDC is 5,000.
[00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:00.720]   Okay.
[00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:01.720]   But it's...
[00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:07.360]   So I think that means whether Apple announces or not, that means there's no dub dub.
[00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:11.520]   Well, they've only announced this for a few weeks and dub dub is traditionally in June.
[00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:12.520]   So...
[00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:14.680]   But the good news is Apple hasn't canceled anything yet because they never announced
[00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:15.680]   it.
[00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:16.680]   There's nothing to cancel.
[00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:17.680]   Right.
[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:18.680]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:19.680]   But that does put a lot of pressure on them.
[00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:24.240]   The fact that all these other conferences, Google I/O, it's just one month before, actually
[00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:26.880]   just a few weeks before WWDC.
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:33.320]   And so if Google is saying that out of a plurality, out of an abundance of caution,
[00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:38.760]   we're canceling the lots of humans getting together and exchanging handshakes part of
[00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:43.360]   it, what does Apple say that we think that in two and a half to three weeks, it's going
[00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:49.160]   to be better or we think that we can organize and run it in a way that is not going to
[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:51.440]   create a health problem.
[00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:53.880]   But like, but just like Alex said, they haven't announced anything yet.
[00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:58.880]   And also a lot of companies are instituting travel bans, especially the bigger ones.
[00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:00.320]   Like you're just not allowed to travel.
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:02.120]   They don't want to take on like the health.
[00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:06.000]   Yes, they're worried about the health, but also the risk of anything happening to you
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.760]   and them being held liable is just a show stopper for them.
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:10.760]   Apple.
[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:14.440]   It's just the difficulty of getting of moving people around whether companies are doing
[00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:15.440]   travel bans or not.
[00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:17.600]   Just how a lot of people are not going to walk.
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:20.760]   I want to move through this quickly because otherwise it's going to be the coronavirus show.
[00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:24.440]   Apple is giving retail and hourly employees unlimited sink leave.
[00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:26.720]   This is something every company in this country should do.
[00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:30.400]   I know a lot can't afford to, but that's the right that Apple certainly can.
[00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:31.920]   That's the right thing to do.
[00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:37.400]   Hourly employees shouldn't feel like they have to come in and risk, you know, illness
[00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:38.800]   or if they're ill come in.
[00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:40.960]   And that's the real risk because they can't afford.
[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:43.920]   And that's especially dangerous for Apple because they've been on this huge open concept
[00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:45.600]   design push for a decade.
[00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:48.280]   Like everything is open for them.
[00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:55.880]   Apple has designed its own flat pack mask for health care workers, face shields.
[00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:59.400]   And he says we can manufacture these at a million of them a week.
[00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:03.400]   I'll just play a little bit of the Tim tweet.
[00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:07.560]   Before you do this, Leo, and before we get really serious, can I just say that it looks
[00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:13.560]   like he has Apple retail version 2.0 quality shelves behind him for his sports memorabilia.
[00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:14.560]   Oh, he does.
[00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:15.560]   Just so on Brad.
[00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:18.800]   That beautiful blonde cedar.
[00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:20.960]   Yeah, it's pretty cool.
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:25.600]   He also has a war eagle, Auburn, signed basketball behind him.
[00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:27.880]   A couple of them it looks like.
[00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:33.600]   So Ray, are you accusing the CEO, Tim Cook of like pilfering stuff from the Apple warehouse?
[00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:35.000]   I think he built it himself.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.640]   I'm now asking who built the shelves in all the new store.
[00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:39.000]   He did it by himself.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.800]   Look, it's even got that nice embedded track lighting.
[00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:43.120]   Yeah, quite lovely.
[00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:47.200]   This video was better than last video because he didn't like he started and stopped it less
[00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:51.640]   awkwardly like he's improving his life into social feed content every week.
[00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:56.200]   I have to say though, I love it that it has that thing where they start in the name sit
[00:28:56.200 --> 00:29:01.000]   back and at the end they come step forward and stop it.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.840]   I'm guessing you can edit those.
[00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:06.800]   Yeah, I'm guessing that that was almost an affectation, right?
[00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:11.320]   Which is where he wanted he wanted the vertical video and clips still doesn't support that.
[00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:13.720]   Wow, that's interesting.
[00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:14.720]   That's interesting.
[00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:17.600]   Well, we'll get to the store we're supposed to be talking about.
[00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:22.280]   But while we're on this, don't you think that this is going to feed just like the iPhone
[00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:25.560]   and the success of the design of the iPhone was a response to how much Apple engineers
[00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:30.160]   hated their current like trio phones and their current Windows phones.
[00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:34.120]   Don't you think that Apple is going to have one hell of a killer like new version of
[00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:38.240]   FaceTime or a conversing app just based on like, okay, there's got to be a way that we
[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:41.560]   don't have to that our users don't have to reach up and touch something in order to
[00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:42.560]   get this.
[00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:47.280]   Can we like AI our way around deleting that automatically?
[00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:52.360]   This the face shield according to the associate executive director of the permanent medical
[00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:57.840]   group for Kaiser Permanente Northern California helps preserve valuable personal protective
[00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:01.480]   equipment for a longer period of time.
[00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:05.240]   Smita Ruayard said it really renews your energy and your spirit.
[00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:07.320]   So they were very grateful.
[00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:09.400]   Very, very grateful to have it.
[00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:11.000]   I think it's really cool.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:16.240]   And it is by the way, I want to point out the thinnest face shield Apple has ever made.
[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:18.440]   So there's a lot to be said.
[00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:19.440]   Great battery life.
[00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:20.440]   Great battery life.
[00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:22.240]   She's going to he's going to reach forward.
[00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:23.240]   Stay safe and stay healthy.
[00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:24.240]   We're not being sensitive.
[00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:25.720]   We're laughing because we're crying.
[00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:26.720]   Yeah.
[00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:27.720]   No, we're not insensitive.
[00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:28.720]   You know what?
[00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:31.720]   You have to be a little black humor in the face of all this, right?
[00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:34.280]   Yeah, that's why I'm always looking at memes.
[00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:36.160]   I'm always looking at COVID memes.
[00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:37.800]   It just makes me feel a little bit better.
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:40.200]   That's why I'm rewatching Tiger King for the eighth time.
[00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:42.760]   Oh, did those tigers test positive too?
[00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:47.880]   Apparently there were some tigers in the zoo, at least one testing positive, which is not
[00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:48.880]   there.
[00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:50.760]   They said veterinary tests are very different from human tests.
[00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:55.040]   So don't be upset that the tiger got ahead of you in line.
[00:30:55.040 --> 00:31:00.000]   Actually, you know, my son, who as you know, flew back from Bali.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.520]   He'd been in Vietnam and Thailand and Bali.
[00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:08.520]   And finally I talked to him on the March 28th to fly back.
[00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:15.840]   He flew back via Tokyo, arrived in the States, was not tested or temperature or anything.
[00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:17.120]   They said, yeah, come on in kid.
[00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:18.120]   Come on in.
[00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:20.240]   But we've been kind of sequestering him.
[00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:25.040]   We got him an Airbnb and he's staying there and he's been there now for 10 days, starting
[00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:26.680]   to come down with symptoms.
[00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:31.400]   So, you know, I don't know what it could be if it's not COVID.
[00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:34.720]   He hasn't seen or touched anything or anybody's not.
[00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:36.080]   So I'm a little nervous.
[00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:38.200]   He calls his doctor, the guy says, we know a test.
[00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:39.200]   We can't test.
[00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:40.200]   We don't have any tests.
[00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:42.760]   But we're going to tell you what I would tell anybody.
[00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:43.760]   You know, don't leave.
[00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:44.760]   Don't go out now.
[00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:45.760]   You can't go out at all.
[00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:46.760]   You can't go shopping.
[00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:47.760]   Can't do anything.
[00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:49.120]   So I'm going to be sending them food and stuff.
[00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:52.720]   And he said, and if you have trouble breathing, call us back.
[00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:53.720]   That's it.
[00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:56.000]   Chris Cuomo has been giving tips on how he's getting through it.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.720]   Like stay bundled up, but walk around, make sure you take your meds, but don't stop breathing.
[00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:00.720]   You've been--
[00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:03.920]   It's nice to be a celebrity because you can get a test if you're famous.
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:04.920]   Yeah.
[00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:07.240]   But the rest of the world is just going.
[00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:08.240]   Yeah.
[00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:09.720]   You know, I was Johnson's and ICU.
[00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:10.720]   I know.
[00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:11.720]   Terrible.
[00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:12.720]   Terrible.
[00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:13.720]   Well, that's why it's so valuable.
[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:17.720]   Part of my thinking kind of evolved a week and a half ago, the first time I read someone
[00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:21.120]   on Reddit or think I think basically went day by day, step to step.
[00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:23.360]   I'm recovered now, but here's what I was feeling.
[00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:24.880]   Here's what I was going through every day.
[00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:30.120]   And that basically gave me a template for, okay, assume that I start to feel sick tomorrow
[00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:32.680]   and I'm not a jerk, so I don't want to.
[00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:33.680]   So, so exactly.
[00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:34.760]   I don't want to leave the house.
[00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:39.440]   What will I need to have in the house to be able to take care of my-- not just-- I already
[00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:42.720]   had a couple of weeks of food, but now it's like, do you have ibuprofen?
[00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:48.040]   Do you have a gatorators or whatever for dehydration?
[00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:53.360]   Is your even-- is the house in the bedroom like clean, tidy enough that you can basically
[00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:54.880]   use it as a sick room?
[00:32:54.880 --> 00:33:01.040]   So again, not hope not the plant-- I don't know what the right word is, not expecting
[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:02.600]   the worst, but at least being ready for plantings.
[00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:06.040]   I think that's sensible and that's what we're all doing right now.
[00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:12.160]   Yeah, because if I would have-- if I had the foresight, I would have planned for running
[00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:16.360]   out of toilet paper and not having any disinfectant lives in the house.
[00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:19.440]   But you would have had to plan that long ago.
[00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:20.440]   That's the problem.
[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:22.720]   And who thought, who knew?
[00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:23.720]   We'll know next time.
[00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:24.720]   We'll be ready next time.
[00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:28.040]   Of course, we'd have to put coronavirus right in there.
[00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:31.680]   I mean, it's a big part of the story and the Apple stores as we do this are still closed
[00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:32.680]   in many areas.
[00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:36.040]   And I hope you're getting through the pandemic.
[00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:39.840]   OK, there's nothing like a cozy fire to warm your hands by.
[00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:44.000]   And yeah, when you're home, you can take off your mask.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   Apple did produce, as you saw, a million plus face shields.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   We need more.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.600]   Make more Apple.
[00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:56.280]   There was, though, a product we remember as the worst product Apple ever made.
[00:33:56.280 --> 00:34:01.480]   Now, if you asked me, could it be the iPod socks?
[00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:02.920]   Maybe.
[00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:05.500]   But they only cost a few bucks.
[00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:08.600]   This was pricey watch.
[00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:15.720]   The single stupidest product Apple has ever made, or I hope ever will make, I would actually
[00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:19.960]   nominate it as the stupidest tech product ever made by a large manufacturing.
[00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:20.960]   Wait a minute, let me think.
[00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:21.960]   What could this be?
[00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:22.960]   Don't say.
[00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:23.960]   Oh, I want to give it away.
[00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:26.160]   This is my dog hat three because four of them would be--
[00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:27.160]   I would be ungracious.
[00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:30.440]   It's an exercise in a riddle for us all.
[00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:31.440]   All right.
[00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:34.360]   The $12,000 solid gold.
[00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:35.360]   There you go.
[00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:36.360]   There you go.
[00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:38.320]   OK, I'll give that to you.
[00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:39.320]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:41.960]   Apple hasn't lost touch with the consumer with that product.
[00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:42.960]   Was it 12?
[00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:44.560]   I think it was even more than that, wasn't it?
[00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:46.840]   It was 18 caragol and it started at that.
[00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:47.840]   It went up.
[00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:48.840]   That was the cheap one.
[00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:51.160]   That was the one with the factory radio and no air conditioning.
[00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:53.160]   It was solid gold.
[00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:58.760]   And remember that Apple created a whole new section of the store with security, especially
[00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:00.880]   concierge service for it.
[00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:02.440]   The box was great.
[00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:03.960]   I'm not complaining about the box.
[00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:08.000]   If you offered me a box, I would probably pay OK money for it because it was a lovely
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   box.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.200]   Oh, you want to band with that?
[00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:12.040]   That'll be $7,000 extra.
[00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:13.040]   Yeah.
[00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:14.040]   It's like--
[00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:15.040]   You know what, though?
[00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:21.960]   They're today version of the luxury version of the Apple Watch, the ceramic.
[00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:22.960]   I'd buy that.
[00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:23.960]   It is.
[00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:24.960]   I have the titanium.
[00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:25.960]   I bought the titanium.
[00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:26.960]   Me too.
[00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:30.560]   I don't know why because honestly, I'm going to get another one the minute the new one
[00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:32.320]   comes out, so it's silly.
[00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:33.880]   Every year I say I'm buying the Nike.
[00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:35.440]   The Nike is the absolute best value.
[00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:38.000]   And they're like, oh, have you seen titanium?
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:39.960]   I know that's going to be like tungsten.
[00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:42.440]   It weighs 13 pounds, but it's the same size.
[00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:43.440]   It's tungsten.
[00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:44.800]   And I'll be like, yes, arm curls.
[00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:45.800]   It'll be great.
[00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:48.240]   The ceramic is beautiful, Laurie.
[00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:49.240]   You're absolutely right.
[00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:50.240]   It's gorgeous.
[00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:51.800]   It's so pretty.
[00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:56.480]   And I think that the Apple Watch edition as a concept was a good idea because it is a
[00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:57.480]   watch.
[00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:59.480]   It was like $12,000 when.
[00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:04.320]   And especially that there's nothing about this design that demands it be made out of
[00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:05.320]   gold.
[00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:06.320]   There's nothing of it.
[00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:10.060]   It was just, hey, I know it's not as simple as, oh, well, we used to-- we were pouring
[00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:11.060]   aluminum into this mold.
[00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:14.840]   We decided just for giggles, we'll support some-- I know it's a lot more complicated
[00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:15.840]   than that.
[00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:18.000]   I think they actually made a big deal of-- it's not just gold.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   It's arm.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:23.640]   We sampled a million different versions of gold to choose this version of gold.
[00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:25.600]   And it's like, really?
[00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:29.120]   This is really what you're spending your time on.
[00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:33.560]   So you actually saw the gold one with their own eyes.
[00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:34.560]   Not me.
[00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:35.560]   I did you.
[00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:36.560]   And it's--
[00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:37.560]   I'm not sure.
[00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:39.560]   I'll call you all wearing two of them on her wrist at the same time.
[00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:40.560]   What?
[00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:41.560]   It's surrounded by Apple people.
[00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:42.560]   No.
[00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:43.560]   She slapped both of them on at the table.
[00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:44.560]   That was our strategy.
[00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:46.800]   Do we know anybody who owns one?
[00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:47.800]   No.
[00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:48.800]   I do.
[00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:49.800]   You do?
[00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:50.800]   You do?
[00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:51.800]   I do.
[00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:52.800]   You seem advanced.
[00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:54.800]   But I don't know if there's no one.
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:55.800]   No, you have to understand.
[00:36:55.800 --> 00:37:00.280]   So at launch day, and I told a story before, Jim Dowel, and I went to the Palo Alto Apple
[00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:03.200]   store, and it was like a bonanza like you expect.
[00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:06.320]   But then afterwards, we went to the coffee shop, and we were sitting there, and there
[00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:11.680]   were these Silicon Valley nerds going, oh, which of the Apple Watch Gold watches are
[00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:12.680]   you going to get?
[00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:13.760]   Oh, I think I'm going to get this one.
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:17.680]   And it's that same conversation at the beginning of the show where certain people have enough
[00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:22.160]   zeros in their bank accounts that none of this, like they buy $25,000 plane seats.
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:24.080]   You know, they buy like $17,000 dresses.
[00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:25.080]   They wear once.
[00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:26.400]   They stay in minimum six star.
[00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:27.760]   It's a different world.
[00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:30.040]   And I'm sure they enjoyed them for the year that they had them.
[00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:32.200]   And I'm sure they're just as happy with their Nike version now.
[00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:36.400]   I'm going to guess that 90% of the people who had them were given them by Apple like
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:38.520]   Beyonce and others to wear them.
[00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:40.120]   I think they were emeritus sales.
[00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:42.920]   I heard that there were large portion of them were in places like the Abu Dhabi and
[00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:43.920]   the Dubai Apple stores.
[00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:44.920]   Yeah.
[00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:47.440]   I mean, if you're a multi-multi-billion, you're going to get a big deal.
[00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:50.680]   A billionaire, you know, $18,000 watch.
[00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:52.600]   It's like a $5 watch for you and me.
[00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:53.600]   It's nothing.
[00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:55.600]   And that's not a good look for Apple is it?
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:56.600]   Oh, it's terrible.
[00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:57.600]   Yeah.
[00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:03.960]   But also we should overlook that at that at that at that media event, there were so many
[00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:06.440]   high ranking people from the fashion world there.
[00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:08.280]   And I'm not talking about Instagram influencers.
[00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:13.240]   I'm talking about like, I think Anna Wintour was there, like leading leaders of like so many
[00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:14.240]   different designs.
[00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:18.040]   And it was on the cover of Vogue for crying out loud.
[00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:22.480]   So and we were standing the PR was so different too because I've been to several Apple events
[00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:27.000]   now, but there was a bunch of people dressed like you would see dressed on reality shows,
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:30.280]   like just completely like things coming out of everywhere going, oh, this feels like a
[00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:33.920]   fashion event doesn't it feels like a fashion event.
[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:35.320]   Was that a bad idea?
[00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:36.760]   Was it really a bad idea?
[00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:37.760]   Maybe it was a good idea.
[00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:40.440]   Maybe they were really got a lot of attention because of it.
[00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:46.880]   No, that was definitely a good idea because their whole idea was to they put so much into
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:49.040]   making this not look like a gadget watch.
[00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:54.640]   If there is one imperative of this launch, it was to not hey, it's got nixie tubes on
[00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:56.880]   it's the size of a can of tuna, but look at that.
[00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:58.240]   It's got a fly on it.
[00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:01.280]   I mean, if they have to say they have to make the quote that we know how to design something
[00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:04.840]   that people are going to want to put on their wrists because this is not going to be just
[00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:07.080]   a gadget that they use for productivity.
[00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:12.160]   This is going to be part of the style statement that they make just like I apparently made
[00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:16.560]   a style statement by putting on a sweater vest over a t-shirt today.
[00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:19.280]   They really did have to make that statement.
[00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:24.120]   This is why it was one of the worst launches from the point of view of I think was very
[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:28.000]   clear that Apple didn't know who was going to buy this.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:31.880]   They also didn't have a lot of it really, really working I think at that time.
[00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:34.520]   So we really put them on their back foot there.
[00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:40.320]   But they knew that if we get the hardware right, you can always put new electrons in
[00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:41.320]   there.
[00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:45.160]   We can't just push out an update to the style of this thing.
[00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:49.720]   And they got the style so right that no one is complaining that, gosh, it's so boring.
[00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:52.320]   It's five years and we haven't seen a new case design.
[00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:56.200]   Like no, you let us have really, really cool different straps.
[00:39:56.200 --> 00:40:02.800]   We let us upgrade from the aluminum one that I can afford five years ago to the stainless
[00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:05.600]   steel one I can afford now.
[00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:06.600]   We're good.
[00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:12.040]   Just give me custom watch faces and then we'll be perfect.
[00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:13.400]   First of all, let's get this out of the way.
[00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:15.080]   You already know it probably.
[00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:22.680]   It was funny the day before the keynote Sunday, John Prosser, Mark Gurman, another Apple
[00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:27.360]   rumor guy, all said no new hardware.
[00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:32.760]   It was clear somebody from Apple called them one by one and said, no, but no.
[00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:34.360]   Nobody from Apple called them.
[00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:35.360]   I was.
[00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:42.040]   No, if it was a Wall Street, if it would run in Bloomberg, if it had run in Wall Street,
[00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:47.080]   if it had been like BuzzFeed news, like if Walt Mossberg had tweeted it.
[00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:49.640]   But let's just say it got out.
[00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:51.640]   Like it got out earlier.
[00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:56.320]   I think it was the Apple's interest though to say ahead of time, look, this is not going
[00:40:56.320 --> 00:41:01.360]   to be about new hardware, not even Apple tags.
[00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:04.040]   Although there was some Apple tag news, so we'll get to that.
[00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:05.720]   There was a new Mac mini kindleo.
[00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:07.160]   I mean, that was new hardware.
[00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:08.160]   Yeah, that was.
[00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:09.160]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:11.760]   You can't buy it.
[00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:16.720]   I actually, I went over a developer account to see if I could get one because it'd be
[00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:20.800]   fun to have, but you have to tell them what app you're going to write with it and all
[00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:21.800]   that stuff.
[00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:22.800]   And I didn't want to lie.
[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:23.800]   That would just be.
[00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:27.920]   Do you remember Steve when he's like, introduced that cheese grater with the Pentium chip
[00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:29.880]   and he's like, and we're going to want him back.
[00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:30.880]   You don't want them floating around out there.
[00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:32.680]   They're like, we're going to get them back.
[00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:33.760]   And that's the same thing with this.
[00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:34.760]   You don't own it.
[00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:36.800]   You rent it $500 though, which is not bad.
[00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:42.920]   It's part of the universal app quick start program and the developer transition kit.
[00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:47.680]   What's interesting is it's an iPad pro with a little more RAM.
[00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:48.680]   Yeah.
[00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:49.920]   And some different words.
[00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:51.160]   You know, that's two.
[00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:52.160]   Yeah.
[00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:56.320]   That's that's I'm sure we'll get into it later, but that started me thinking that so what's
[00:41:56.320 --> 00:42:01.760]   stopping me from being able to install Mac OS on a brand new iPad, your your your your
[00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:06.480]   Apple, you're essentially telling me that a lot most of what I need is already available
[00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:07.480]   in a Mac box.
[00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:08.480]   Well, breaking a dream Andy.
[00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:09.480]   And you'll break it.
[00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:12.160]   I do think it's a ram issue, but we'll get to that.
[00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:22.360]   So the key here though is that they did and they reveal this later the whole keynote.
[00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:28.720]   All of the big Sir demos, all of the Mac demos on this and it looked perfectly normal.
[00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:29.880]   It didn't tell again, right?
[00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:30.880]   Yeah.
[00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:32.920]   Nobody said, oh boy, it looks sluggish.
[00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:33.920]   None of that.
[00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:40.920]   They then later ran Maya and final because they said final cuts ready.
[00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:42.600]   They said logic is ready.
[00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:48.320]   They showed off light room, light room adobe's been working on a shadow, the Tomb Raider kind
[00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:49.320]   of.
[00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:50.320]   Yeah.
[00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:55.000]   I mean, some of that stuff didn't look great, but you know, I mean, this is this is an
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.800]   even was emulated 1080p on an iPad.
[00:42:57.800 --> 00:42:58.800]   Yeah.
[00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:01.880]   I mean, this isn't even close to what they're going to release.
[00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:02.880]   So yeah.
[00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:08.160]   And as we suspected, not one word about not they didn't mention the ARM word at all.
[00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:09.160]   It's Apple Silicon.
[00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:10.960]   They're moving from Intel Apple.
[00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:15.000]   I went back and looked and Steve Jobs never said x86 or mentioned any instruction sets.
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:18.480]   He's like it's Intel because you knew that was a name everyone would recognize from
[00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:22.840]   when tells monopoly or duopoly or whatever it was at the time.
[00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:24.400]   And it's just that's the marketing term.
[00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:28.520]   And I think for Apple, it's a arm and 90% of the casual viewers would say what, like an
[00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:29.520]   arm.
[00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:30.520]   Yeah.
[00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:31.840]   And this is just like, oh, my iPhone and iPad chip, that's great.
[00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:32.840]   I love those.
[00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:36.840]   I think there's also a reason not to say arm because arm has maybe a bad reputation among
[00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:39.120]   people who've tried, for instance, Windows on arm.
[00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:41.280]   It's felt sluggish and I saw it.
[00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:43.680]   Well, one eye arm, there's not just that.
[00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:44.680]   Make their own chips.
[00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:45.680]   Yeah.
[00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:48.840]   And I think it's just that, but it also underscores that this is our own technology.
[00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:51.240]   We're not just jumping on this arm bandwagon.
[00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:52.240]   We are.
[00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:56.320]   And no one cares what the letters on the chip are.
[00:43:56.320 --> 00:44:00.080]   They just care about what do I get from this and why should I not be scared?
[00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:04.480]   I think that Apple really did address both of those during the keynote yesterday.
[00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:06.480]   Laurie, what is elegant?
[00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:07.480]   Are you excited?
[00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:11.120]   Are you going to get a DTK, man?
[00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:13.920]   No, for similar reasons to you.
[00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:16.200]   I don't have an app to develop on it.
[00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:19.640]   So I would just want it just to run it and see how it works.
[00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:26.520]   But I have been running Mac OS and it does give you a hint at the future of an Apple
[00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:30.200]   Silicon Mac, for sure, just visually.
[00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:31.680]   So I should point that out.
[00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:34.520]   And we should see a show of hands.
[00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:43.720]   Developer versions of the new iOS, iPad, OS TV, OS, watch, OS and OS 11 are all of
[00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:47.120]   we're all available day of who had you installed it.
[00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:49.120]   Laurie, all of them, what did you install?
[00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:53.440]   I haven't gotten to Apple watch yet, but that's just because my spare Apple watch wasn't charged
[00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:54.440]   yet.
[00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:55.440]   So I'm getting there.
[00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:56.440]   But everything.
[00:44:56.440 --> 00:44:57.600]   Oh, and haven't gotten to Apple TV yet.
[00:44:57.600 --> 00:45:02.600]   It's just a matter of the time that it takes, especially the I always have trouble with Mac
[00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:06.160]   OS installing it because I partition my hard drive this time.
[00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:09.400]   I made it a volume on my MacBook Pro.
[00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:11.320]   So it always takes a while.
[00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:13.360]   You have to delete things and redo them.
[00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:15.120]   So right now I've got them on three things.
[00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:17.120]   iPad, iPhone and Mac.
[00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:18.240]   Well, that's interesting.
[00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:26.720]   So you could use disk utility, create an APFS volume, not touch your existing Catalina.
[00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:27.720]   Yeah, that's a good question.
[00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:28.720]   Right.
[00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:30.200]   And install it into that volume.
[00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:32.480]   And now if you wanted to, it's a dual boot, right?
[00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:33.960]   You could boot into Big Sur.
[00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:34.960]   Yeah.
[00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:38.200]   Oh, I might try that because I have to, Renee, what did you install?
[00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:39.840]   Do you install them all?
[00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:41.320]   I installed it.
[00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:44.520]   So the only, yes, I installed it all and I installed them on my daily drivers because
[00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:48.400]   no matter what the pain, I feel like I'm not going to use them enough, like to be honest
[00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:51.960]   about them if I don't put them where I'm always using them.
[00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:57.040]   Except I didn't put it on my final cut editing machine because like, I know the people who
[00:45:57.040 --> 00:46:00.960]   do that, like people like Martin, like, say solve it, they do that.
[00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:01.960]   And they're like, it's fine.
[00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:04.760]   But then maybe beta two happens or beta four happens.
[00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:05.760]   Right.
[00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:08.080]   And like last year, you just couldn't launch it under beta four.
[00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:09.880]   You know, so it's like it wouldn't run.
[00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:13.120]   So I put that on a, I was lucky if I had a second computer here.
[00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:15.080]   I put it on that just so I could play with it.
[00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:18.520]   But otherwise I vastly prefer putting them on my, my daily drivers.
[00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:20.160]   Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:21.840]   Andy, did you install?
[00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:22.840]   You don't have an eye.
[00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:23.840]   Well, maybe you do have an iPhone.
[00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:24.840]   I don't know.
[00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:25.840]   No, I do.
[00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:27.360]   I installed it on one of my older iPhones.
[00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:30.040]   I have not installed it on my iPad Pro yet.
[00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:32.480]   I have not installed it on one of my old Macs yet.
[00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:33.720]   That's coming later this week.
[00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:37.920]   A lot of, a lot of, a lot of last night was, okay, I will admit something.
[00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:41.560]   I did decide to social distance.
[00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:45.200]   And so while the keynote was streaming, I was actually at the town beach.
[00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:46.200]   How ever.
[00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:48.440]   So I was like, how did yourself work?
[00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:53.440]   Because as you well know, when Apple's got an event, they vacate the beaches.
[00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:54.440]   There's no one there.
[00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:55.440]   It's great.
[00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:56.440]   Exactly.
[00:46:56.440 --> 00:46:57.440]   Have the beach to yourself.
[00:46:57.440 --> 00:46:58.440]   Yeah.
[00:46:58.440 --> 00:46:59.440]   It's just the Microsoft people and Andy.
[00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:00.440]   Yeah.
[00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:01.440]   Yep.
[00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:05.160]   But yeah, but so, so yeah, so I decided what, what, what was, what was the easiest to
[00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:08.480]   install, what had some of the most interesting things that it was?
[00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:13.720]   And unfortunately, I didn't have the wherewithal at the moment to suddenly sacrifice one of
[00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:17.560]   my Macs to the beta gods or the dev gods.
[00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:22.880]   But that, but I have to say that it really is a tie for first place between things I'm
[00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:28.480]   excited to try on the iPhone and things I'm really excited to see live click and drag
[00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:29.640]   on the, on the Mac.
[00:47:29.640 --> 00:47:34.120]   Cause that was, again, we'll talk about the stuff in depth, but that was a huge leap forward
[00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:35.120]   for the Mac yesterday.
[00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:37.680]   Here's Jonathan man.
[00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:38.680]   Hi Jonathan.
[00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:39.680]   Welcome.
[00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:40.680]   Thank you.
[00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:41.680]   How you doing?
[00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:43.200]   We're thrilled that you could come on.
[00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:48.480]   We all wanted to wish it was a happy birthday and I thought maybe, maybe Jonathan would
[00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:50.760]   have a good way to do that.
[00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:53.400]   I do have a good way to do that.
[00:47:53.400 --> 00:48:00.560]   Um, 10 years, 10 years ago, uh, after Steve used my, after Steve Jobs used my song and
[00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:07.240]   the Intenigate thing, Steve Wozniak's wife commissioned me to make him a birthday song.
[00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:13.360]   Um, and then out of the blue couple of months ago, here we are 10 years later for his, that
[00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:14.360]   was a 60th.
[00:48:14.360 --> 00:48:16.160]   This is a 70th.
[00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:17.240]   She asked me to do it again.
[00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:23.400]   So I, so I, I, uh, 10 years, all of us are 10 years older.
[00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:26.000]   And so I wrote him another song and we'll be hearing it.
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:28.960]   I'm sure tonight, but let's get a preview.
[00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:29.960]   Yes.
[00:48:29.960 --> 00:48:33.840]   Uh, yeah, I think they're going to be playing the video there, uh, that I made for him,
[00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:38.400]   but I will do, I will do you a acoustic version.
[00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:41.000]   So here, here we go.
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:47.000]   Well, happiness equals smiles minus frowns.
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:54.800]   And laughter is the most beautiful sound.
[00:48:54.800 --> 00:49:00.080]   That's the point, if it isn't fun, you get nothing done with that passion.
[00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:04.440]   Oh, oh, oh, that's the woz.
[00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:09.840]   Oh, oh, oh, oh, that's the woz.
[00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:16.440]   He likes math tricks and gadgets and raspberry pie projects.
[00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:20.640]   He made a camera that detects hummingbirds.
[00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:24.280]   Three kids, seven grandkids.
[00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:27.120]   Oh, he loves taking road trips.
[00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:30.280]   He'd give you the shirt off his back.
[00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:33.160]   You just say the word.
[00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:35.920]   Who was his god?
[00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:42.240]   Everything he could ever want, including honorary doctoral degrees.
[00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:46.440]   So on his birthday, don't email.
[00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:49.640]   No gifts, please as well.
[00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:55.720]   Please donate to his favorite charity, inspiringchildren.net.
[00:49:55.720 --> 00:50:03.240]   Oh, happiness equals smiles minus frowns.
[00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:07.360]   And laughter is the most beautiful sound.
[00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:14.400]   What's the point, if it isn't fun, you get nothing done with that passion.
[00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:19.480]   Oh, oh, oh, oh, that's the woz.
[00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:22.960]   Oh, oh, oh, that's the woz.
[00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:25.960]   Oh, oh, oh, that's the woz.
[00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:36.440]   He invented the personal computer, pouring his heart into subroutine.
[00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:47.240]   Remember when he was on dancing with the star, and Big Bang, a fearing.
[00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:56.520]   And on celebrity watch party, oh, you can clearly see, woz's tender heart is on display.
[00:50:56.520 --> 00:51:01.160]   And he's proud of being a geek.
[00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:07.680]   And feels so lucky, because Janet loves him every minute of every day.
[00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:11.960]   Ooh, Ben could never broken.
[00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:19.960]   And he loves inspiring children to be the kindest, most passionate they can be.
[00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:28.560]   He's always got time for fans, so if you can lend a hand, please donate to his favorite
[00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:33.120]   charity, inspiringchildren.net.
[00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:41.560]   Oh, because happiness equals smiles minus frowns.
[00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:45.440]   And laughter is the most, a beautiful sound.
[00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:52.920]   Who wants the point if it isn't fun, you get nothing done with that passion.
[00:51:52.920 --> 00:51:57.920]   Oh, oh, oh, that's the woz.
[00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:03.920]   Oh, oh, oh, that's the woz.
[00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:17.440]   Yeah, very nice.
[00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:19.680]   Thank you, Jonathan Mann.
[00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:23.680]   The song "A Day" man, you can follow him on YouTube.
[00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:28.440]   Unaccountably his YouTube channel is The Rock Cookie Bottom.
[00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:32.440]   But I think if you just search for Jonathan Mann, you'll be sure there's a story there.
[00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:34.520]   Yeah, there is.
[00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:37.180]   And of course, he's got a podcast at podcast.
[00:52:37.180 --> 00:52:40.000]   Jonathan Mann with two ends.net.
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:42.560]   Jonathan, thank you so much for performing for that for us.
[00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:44.080]   I can't wait till tonight.
[00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:45.640]   We got the unplugged version.
[00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:50.040]   We'll see the full mix tonight at wozbday.net.
[00:52:50.040 --> 00:52:51.240]   Thank you all so much.
[00:52:51.240 --> 00:52:52.560]   Thank you so much, Jonathan.
[00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:53.560]   Have a great day.
[00:52:53.560 --> 00:52:54.560]   Yay.
[00:52:54.560 --> 00:52:55.560]   Have a good one.
[00:52:55.560 --> 00:52:58.160]   Applause from the chat room there silent, but they're plotting.
[00:52:58.160 --> 00:52:59.160]   Trust me.
[00:52:59.160 --> 00:53:04.120]   If someone who's written a song a day for thousands of days can't find a rhyme for inspiring
[00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:07.480]   children.net, it's not possible.
[00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:12.800]   2020 was a year that kept on giving most good and bad.
[00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:17.480]   And there's one story that broke in 2020 that will probably still be around in our best
[00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:23.840]   devs in 2021, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, even probably all the way up to 2030.
[00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:28.160]   And that's the epic battle between Epic Games and Apple.
[00:53:29.160 --> 00:53:35.120]   I'm going to stay above the fray for a moment because I'm a little heated about all of this.
[00:53:35.120 --> 00:53:37.560]   And Google, let's not forget it's a three-way fight.
[00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:39.120]   Yeah, Google, I don't think.
[00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:43.360]   I'm not, you know, OK, so here's the deal you all know, but I'm just going to give
[00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:45.160]   a quick recapitulation.
[00:53:45.160 --> 00:53:50.840]   So for those who don't, on Thursday, Epic launched a missile.
[00:53:50.840 --> 00:53:53.720]   I mean, it really had clearly planned to begin this war.
[00:53:53.720 --> 00:53:57.720]   It knew it had a 30-page court pleading prepared.
[00:53:57.720 --> 00:54:03.000]   It had a 1984 style movie made.
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:09.600]   They put, they replaced the in-app purchases on, at first on iOS and then on the Google
[00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:15.760]   Play Store with a mechanism that would get around it so that you could buy credits from
[00:54:15.760 --> 00:54:20.800]   Epic directly and not pay the 30% to Apple or Google.
[00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:25.440]   Both Apple and Google immediately responded by pulling Fortnite from the Play Store.
[00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:30.560]   Now Fortnite is a free game, but the in-app purchases have been very successful.
[00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:34.160]   They've made Tim Sweeney an Epic billions and billions of dollars.
[00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:39.600]   I think Sweeney made $7 billion last year in the Fortnite DLC stuff.
[00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:41.960]   You know, dance moves, outfits, all of that stuff.
[00:54:41.960 --> 00:54:42.960]   It's very successful.
[00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:43.960]   People love it.
[00:54:43.960 --> 00:54:44.960]   It's a great game.
[00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:48.040]   And by the way, it's not exclusive to iOS or Android.
[00:54:48.040 --> 00:54:52.440]   It's probably much more played on PC or consoles.
[00:54:52.440 --> 00:55:00.480]   In fact, they even pay the 30% to both Sony and Microsoft for in-game app purchases in
[00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:02.960]   their stores.
[00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:04.840]   And they didn't pull it there.
[00:55:04.840 --> 00:55:11.120]   But remember that Tim Sweeney had started this fight when they first put Epic Fortnite
[00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:14.680]   on Google Play or on Android.
[00:55:14.680 --> 00:55:17.040]   They decided not to go through the Google Play Store.
[00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:21.280]   They said, "Well, you can sideload it because we don't want to give them 30%.
[00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:24.640]   But it turned out to be a little more, a little more complicated and be a little more risky
[00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:25.720]   to do the sideloading.
[00:55:25.720 --> 00:55:28.640]   In fact, it didn't launch well.
[00:55:28.640 --> 00:55:33.200]   Somebody, some hacker was able to get an insert malware into the downloads initially.
[00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:36.760]   So eventually they joined the Google Play Store.
[00:55:36.760 --> 00:55:40.600]   Apple's response and Google's response, as I said, to pull the game down.
[00:55:40.600 --> 00:55:47.040]   But then Apple this week went one step further and perhaps a step too far.
[00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:55.440]   Epic sued immediately and what Apple's response to that was, they sued Apple and Google,
[00:55:55.440 --> 00:55:57.760]   was to yank or threaten to yank.
[00:55:57.760 --> 00:56:00.880]   It'll be an effect August 28th.
[00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:08.400]   Epic's developer credentials, which means no Epic properties could be updated in the
[00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:15.240]   app store, including the apparently, according to Epic, the Unreal Engine.
[00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:20.680]   The Unreal Engine is not only used for Fortnite, it's used for many, many iOS games.
[00:56:20.680 --> 00:56:22.920]   And those game developers would be put on the spot.
[00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:29.600]   They would either have to replace the Unreal Engine, which is not really doable, or not
[00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:32.600]   be able to update their apps ever again.
[00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:36.760]   They could release it unsigned, but they'd have to give up their own signing privileges
[00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:37.760]   to do that.
[00:56:37.760 --> 00:56:39.560]   So that's where I want to begin.
[00:56:39.560 --> 00:56:45.560]   Because I know that both you and Laurie have dug deep into this and Andy have dug deep into
[00:56:45.560 --> 00:56:46.560]   this.
[00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:55.520]   Epic says that by doing that, this retaliatory move, they have jeopardized Unreal Engine.
[00:56:55.520 --> 00:56:59.880]   And in the legal document, they immediately filed for injunctive relief from the courts
[00:56:59.880 --> 00:57:00.880]   in the document.
[00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:06.400]   They said, "If the Unreal Engine can no longer support Apple platforms, the software developers
[00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:11.040]   that use it will be forced to use alternatives, the damage to Epic's ongoing business and
[00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:16.880]   to its reputation and trust with its customers will be unquantifiable and irreparable.
[00:57:16.880 --> 00:57:22.160]   Preliminary injunctive relief is necessary to prevent Apple from crushing Epic before
[00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:24.760]   this case could ever get to judgment."
[00:57:24.760 --> 00:57:30.080]   Is it the case that yanking the developer credentials, is that the effect it would have,
[00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:31.080]   Renee?
[00:57:31.080 --> 00:57:36.320]   So, can I answer a preface as quickly by saying that all the legal stuff is posturing, like
[00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:40.960]   everyone is taking the most extreme position possible to sort of make the most extreme
[00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:42.320]   case possible.
[00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:47.320]   And I truly do believe that all of them sincerely think that they are in the right and are rationalizing
[00:57:47.320 --> 00:57:50.520]   their behavior by telling us that they're doing it all for us.
[00:57:50.520 --> 00:57:54.760]   And there is a lot of, like just so much, all the money at stake.
[00:57:54.760 --> 00:58:03.080]   So technically, they are both Apple and Epic are using the Obi-Wan Kenobi version of the
[00:58:03.080 --> 00:58:05.480]   truth, whereas from a certain point of view.
[00:58:05.480 --> 00:58:09.000]   Like Apple is saying, "This is level playing field for all the apps."
[00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:10.400]   And this is in Apple's agreement.
[00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:14.840]   It says, "Let me give you Apple's response from last night.
[00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:19.440]   The app store is designed to be a safe and just so that everybody gets their pleadings
[00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:20.440]   app.
[00:58:20.440 --> 00:58:23.480]   The Apple store is designed to be a safe and trusted place for users and a great business
[00:58:23.480 --> 00:58:24.960]   opportunity for all developers.
[00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:29.960]   Epic has been one of the most successful developers in the app store, undeniably true,
[00:58:29.960 --> 00:58:34.360]   growing into a multi-billion dollar business that reaches millions of iOS customers around
[00:58:34.360 --> 00:58:35.360]   the world.
[00:58:35.360 --> 00:58:40.680]   We very much want to keep the company as part of the Apple developer program and their apps
[00:58:40.680 --> 00:58:42.320]   on the store.
[00:58:42.320 --> 00:58:49.080]   The problem Epic has created for itself is one that can be easily remedied if they submit
[00:58:49.080 --> 00:58:53.920]   an update of their app that reverts it to comply with the guidelines they agreed to and which
[00:58:53.920 --> 00:58:55.800]   apply to all developers.
[00:58:55.800 --> 00:58:59.280]   We won't make an exception for Epic because we don't think it's right to put their business
[00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:03.720]   interests ahead of the guidelines that protect our customers.
[00:59:03.720 --> 00:59:10.200]   But it seems to me that still would be true, but the minute they yank developer, is that
[00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:12.000]   part of the agreement?
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:17.240]   Yeah, in the agreement it says that you at first they give you a time period to fix it
[00:59:17.240 --> 00:59:18.560]   and then you lose your...
[00:59:18.560 --> 00:59:19.560]   Okay.
[00:59:19.560 --> 00:59:22.080]   But most developers, that's fine because they just can't put their app up.
[00:59:22.080 --> 00:59:26.920]   But Epic, I think both Apple and Epic forget in this that they are responsible for a huge
[00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:29.720]   dependency for the other developer.
[00:59:29.720 --> 00:59:34.800]   Yeah, and if either Apple or Epic does anything to jeopardize the Unreal Engine, it's not just
[00:59:34.800 --> 00:59:36.200]   them who suffer.
[00:59:36.200 --> 00:59:37.640]   Epic could release it as unsigned.
[00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:41.160]   You can still, we talked about this before, you can go into a terminal command.
[00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:44.800]   It reveals a little button that says don't turn off Gatekeeper and you can still install
[00:59:44.800 --> 00:59:45.800]   Unreal.
[00:59:45.800 --> 00:59:52.040]   So if Unreal lets you sign applications with your certificate inside their app and they
[00:59:52.040 --> 00:59:55.240]   require certification to be able to do that part of it.
[00:59:55.240 --> 00:59:56.920]   So it would just make it...
[00:59:56.920 --> 00:59:58.480]   It's already a really tough...
[00:59:58.480 --> 01:00:00.800]   Brandon was talking about how tough the procedure is.
[01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:05.720]   It's already really tough to spit out a finalized app and it would just make it that much tougher.
[01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:09.960]   And Epic, as we see from their pleading against Google, they hate the idea of sideloading.
[01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:10.960]   It's just not...
[01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:14.280]   They don't think normal people do it.
[01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:17.360]   And you can't sideload on iOS.
[01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:20.920]   No, you can't on Mac, though, so that's the developer part that people were concerned
[01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:21.920]   about.
[01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:27.640]   You can move on credentials, it affects the game developers downloading and installing
[01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:31.440]   Unreal Engine on their Mac in order to make an iOS app.
[01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:36.160]   It doesn't impinge on the iOS app itself.
[01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:38.320]   It's merely they can't get updates on...
[01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:39.320]   Updating it, yeah.
[01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:43.440]   Well, they can, but they'd have to go through the same sideloading process that Epic says
[01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:45.640]   is so egregious on Android.
[01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:50.280]   So basically, they contend that, again, normal people don't sideload Apple and Google make
[01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:52.120]   it seem so scary when you do it.
[01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:55.760]   And they effectively block you by not making it the default status and use things like
[01:00:55.760 --> 01:01:00.880]   Google Protect and Gatekeeper to make it almost effectively impossible in their wording to
[01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:01.880]   do it.
[01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:05.280]   So they want full access without having to go through that procedure.
[01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:07.000]   So it struck me...
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:10.360]   At least the optics of it.
[01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:11.360]   The second blow...
[01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:12.520]   It's all bad.
[01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:14.920]   It really looked like for Apple, I think.
[01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:16.200]   Well, maybe that's just my point of view.
[01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:20.040]   But for Apple, the optics of saying, "Hey, you got a nice ecosystem you got here.
[01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:23.240]   It'd be a shame if anything happened to it."
[01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:29.320]   Laurie, how are regular people going to react to this?
[01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:30.640]   I think they're going to react like I did.
[01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:32.400]   They don't know what the agreement is.
[01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:38.040]   They're going to say, "Apple, you are being dicks, or is it epic?"
[01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:43.080]   Well, no, they're going to say...
[01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:50.760]   Epic Games has really done a good job of marketing this as the tyrannical overlord that is Apple
[01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:52.040]   into a lesser degree.
[01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:54.600]   Google are the ones who are doing everything wrong here.
[01:01:54.600 --> 01:02:03.280]   The average person is not going to see this as Apple trying to adhere to its guidelines.
[01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:06.560]   They're not going to see Epic as having done something wrong.
[01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:07.560]   It's definitely...
[01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:10.600]   And unfortunately, Apple is the one who's looking the worse in this case, even though
[01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:13.360]   Google is doing the exact same thing too.
[01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:14.360]   See, Google...
[01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:16.360]   Apple is the one getting the more...
[01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:21.200]   Is less than a Google's less of a monopoly because you can sideload.
[01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:23.000]   Apple prohibits that, says you cannot...
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.200]   And they're not a development platform.
[01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:26.720]   Nobody's writing on real apps using their Android phone.
[01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:28.880]   They're doing it on Windows, or they're doing it on Mac.
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:34.160]   Also, they're a lot less stringent about collecting 30% on every transaction that happens within
[01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:35.160]   the ecosystem.
[01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:36.160]   Not on games though.
[01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:38.200]   In games, they're identical to Apple.
[01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:39.200]   Right.
[01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:43.960]   But their argument at Epic is that this is a universal thing that is just no good and
[01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:45.160]   shouldn't be allowed.
[01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:52.120]   Although, let's also admit that part of the fun is that Epic didn't just do a search and
[01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:56.560]   replace Google and Apple when they file the lawsuit against Google.
[01:02:56.560 --> 01:03:03.000]   Google's lawsuit specifically calls out, and every time I want to say this, I want to use
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:06.640]   like the Southern sweaty country lawyer voice.
[01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:10.440]   You have founded upon the principle that...
[01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:12.720]   Don't do evil.
[01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:16.400]   Well, what have you to say about this now, sir?
[01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:23.800]   But part of the lawsuit against Google mentions that, for instance, Epic tried to get a deal
[01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:29.000]   with OnePlus, for instance, to put the Epic Game Store preloaded on all of their phones.
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:36.120]   That had to have a deal in place, but Google stepped in and said to OnePlus, we would very
[01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:39.640]   much like for you not to do this deal and the deal was kibosh.
[01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:45.760]   So this underscores the fact that this was not for people on Twitter and other social
[01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:48.120]   media that are saying, "Oh, well, this is a stupid lawsuit.
[01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:50.600]   You can't possibly proceed."
[01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:55.560]   That has the idea that this was something that they did impulsively as opposed to something
[01:03:55.560 --> 01:04:00.800]   they built month by month over a period of a year to make sure that whatever arguments
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:07.080]   they make, they have Christine Varney as part of their co-counsel for office.
[01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:11.760]   Explain to me how this makes customers safer.
[01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:14.200]   How about it makes customers safer?
[01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:15.200]   This is Apple's response.
[01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:20.240]   We're trying to make Apple customers safer.
[01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:23.440]   We've proven that it's not like they've handled transactions, and this is part of Apple's
[01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:24.440]   complaint.
[01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:25.440]   It's not like they've done transactions for Amazon.
[01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:29.720]   When you buy non-digital goods, transactions are handled through the vendor, not through
[01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:31.080]   Apple, and those are secure.
[01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:35.920]   When you install apps using Gatekeeper and when you install apps using sideloading on
[01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:36.920]   Android.
[01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:40.360]   Apple says we won't make an exception for Epic because we don't think it's right to put
[01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:45.360]   their business interests ahead of the guidelines that protect our customers.
[01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:50.440]   In fact, they should say, "We don't think it's right for them to put their business interests
[01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:52.560]   ahead of our business interests."
[01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:53.560]   That's the truth.
[01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:55.320]   This is why it hurts Apple.
[01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:59.120]   This is why it hurts Apple because they have the right to do this.
[01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:00.680]   It's in the agreement.
[01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:05.160]   It looks terrible because it followed on after the lawsuit.
[01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:09.000]   They said, "Well, in that case, no developer license for you and we're going to hurt an
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.240]   entire ecosystem of people."
[01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:15.880]   You can't make the argument, despite Apple's statement, that it's protecting customers.
[01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:18.440]   It's protecting our bottom line.
[01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:21.760]   I think the optics on this could not be worse.
[01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:25.240]   Either Apple has merit, whether it's doing the right thing, whether you can argue that
[01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:30.240]   they've added so much value that it's 30% is the norm and all that stuff doesn't matter
[01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:34.600]   because the normal person is going to look at this and say, "What dicks?"
[01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:39.000]   We all watch the event, obviously.
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:43.720]   I'll tell you the one thing that really stood out for me and it's going to be an issue for
[01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:48.080]   Apple is we knew where they were going to ask a new watch.
[01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:49.720]   We knew they were going to ask a new iPad Air.
[01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:50.920]   They added some things in there.
[01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:52.880]   They did not mention tags.
[01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:54.480]   They did not mention speakers.
[01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:56.440]   They did not mention iPhone.
[01:05:56.440 --> 01:05:58.520]   We know there's more to come, obviously.
[01:05:58.520 --> 01:06:00.280]   There's more than one more thing.
[01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:06.360]   They did surprise me still when they talked about the new iPad Air because it has a new
[01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:10.320]   Apple Silicon, a 14 chip in it.
[01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:17.120]   It is now faster than the high priced iPad Pro.
[01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:25.760]   Does this mean everybody was saying on Twitter, "I guess nobody's going to buy an iPad 11-inch
[01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:28.240]   iPad Pro anymore."
[01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:29.440]   There are very few differences.
[01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:31.880]   You still get the 120Hz on the iPad Pro.
[01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:35.360]   They didn't mention that, at least for the iPad Air.
[01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:36.560]   You get Face ID.
[01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:38.280]   I'm glad to see Face ID go.
[01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:44.320]   I think the on/off button fingerprint reader sounds like a much improved solution.
[01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:48.200]   It remains to be seen how well it's going to work.
[01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:53.840]   But I think that Face ID was less essential on a big screen device than it is on a handheld
[01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:54.840]   device.
[01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:59.320]   I would like to think that this means that that gives us reason to wonder exactly how
[01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:04.520]   far ahead the new iPad Pro was going to come as soon as it's released.
[01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:07.200]   I thought maybe they'd announce it today, but they did not.
[01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:11.360]   They had just updated the iPad Pros with the new cameras, the LiDAR.
[01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:12.360]   Yeah.
[01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:17.440]   I think one of the things that's going to happen, and this might be crazy, but this is a good
[01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:23.320]   beta test for Touch ID on a button because then the iPhone will get two biometric factor
[01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:26.160]   identification for…
[01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:27.160]   You can do like…
[01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:30.400]   If you want to buy an app, you can use either finger or face, right?
[01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:34.200]   But if you want to make a transaction like a money purchase, you're going to have to
[01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:36.040]   put finger and face.
[01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:38.400]   And then there's almost no way to beat that.
[01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:41.200]   I never thought of that, but you're right.
[01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:42.200]   It's brilliant.
[01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:43.920]   Two factor biometrics.
[01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:45.080]   Two factor biometrics.
[01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:46.080]   No.
[01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:51.200]   Well, is Apple willing to make the statement that actually when we said that there's no
[01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:58.320]   better, no more secure way to authenticate on this device than Face ID, actually maybe
[01:07:58.320 --> 01:08:00.720]   you do want to do both of these at the same.
[01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:02.120]   I could really see it.
[01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:07.440]   I could really see them doing it as a belt and suspenders sort of situation because as
[01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:13.040]   we have seen, there are times when you maybe Face ID is not very, very convenient and
[01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:16.960]   there are times when taking a glove off a hand is not very, very convenient.
[01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:19.280]   But that's for the normal course events.
[01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:22.320]   I think what Doc Ruck is saying is normal course events, one or the other, but in those
[01:08:22.320 --> 01:08:26.800]   special times like you're buying something where you really want to be secure, you might
[01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:29.640]   say I want both or like you're logging into your bank.
[01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:30.640]   I don't know.
[01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:35.960]   Even like now with wearing mask and stuff like the ability to make you back right now.
[01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:36.960]   Yes.
[01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:41.000]   I want to be able to face ID until I had the rock the mass 24/7.
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:44.280]   I went to school in Japan, so I wore a mask all the time like I was using that.
[01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:45.280]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:46.280]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:50.000]   But having to wear, I mean, having to unlock my phone when I want to use Apple Pay because
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:54.440]   I don't want to touch the punchy thing, the way you call it little display.
[01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:56.080]   So I like to tap with my phone.
[01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:59.920]   And so yeah, it's great to not to be able to have to take that off there.
[01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:04.320]   Yeah, I don't mind losing my face ID to be honest with you.
[01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:09.760]   And I should mention that that on/off switch fingerprint is used by a lot of companies.
[01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:11.600]   It's used on PCs.
[01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:15.800]   It's used, I think Google uses it on some of their devices.
[01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:17.160]   Samsung uses it.
[01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:18.880]   It's on a lot of phones.
[01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:20.280]   Every time I've used it, it's very reliable.
[01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:25.320]   It's actually on the Surface Duo, the Microsoft thing.
[01:09:25.320 --> 01:09:27.520]   It's fast, it's accurate, it's very easy to use.
[01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:31.400]   And you see, it's just, what it really is is a little, and Apple showed this in the event,
[01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:33.880]   it's a little scanner.
[01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:37.280]   And you could put that on the on/off switch, and it works very quickly and well.
[01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:38.960]   I think it's just a logical place to put it.
[01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:43.480]   What was it, a OnePlus, something I had had that, and I liked it a lot.
[01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:44.480]   And the whole thing about it, it seems so small.
[01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:45.480]   It seems so small.
[01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:46.480]   It's bigger with the screen.
[01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:47.480]   I know, it does, doesn't it?
[01:09:47.480 --> 01:09:48.480]   But I think it's still good.
[01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:50.280]   But if it works, it works.
[01:09:50.280 --> 01:09:51.280]   That's great.
[01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:55.800]   I like to hear that there's already products that have success with using it so that we
[01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:58.120]   know it's an existing technology.
[01:09:58.120 --> 01:10:01.600]   It's not going to fail every third time necessarily.
[01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:03.720]   It's good.
[01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:06.200]   I'm thrilled.
[01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:09.960]   I am thrilled.
[01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:12.040]   But I am worried about the Ed 11-inch iPad Pro.
[01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:16.600]   I mean, I guess it's 150, somebody in the chat room did the numbers.
[01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:20.640]   150 bucks more for the 11-inch iPad Pro versus the Air.
[01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:27.320]   You get additional camera lenses, you get LiDAR, and you get 120 Hertz.
[01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:30.280]   So there's some benefits, but not many.
[01:10:30.280 --> 01:10:36.120]   They could make sure that the screen size is always going to be an advantage.
[01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:39.280]   They could make sure that the top storage is always going to be an advantage.
[01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:40.280]   They're ways to differentiate.
[01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:44.040]   Well, the 12.99-inch iPad Pro I could see, right?
[01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:47.080]   By the way, this is the iPad Air.
[01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:48.480]   That is a LiD.
[01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:51.800]   You can even see it is not an all-screen design.
[01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:52.800]   There's bezels.
[01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:53.800]   I definitely see bezels.
[01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:54.800]   Am I wrong?
[01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:58.720]   Let's actually hold it without buying something accidentally.
[01:10:58.720 --> 01:10:59.720]   Can we please?
[01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:00.720]   You're right.
[01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:03.720]   You do need a bezel on a tablet, I agree.
[01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:07.520]   Let's not call it an all-screen design.
[01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:12.280]   Bezels are like the smash mouth of industrial design.
[01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:17.520]   It's like, what did they ever do to get everybody so mad at it and telling everybody that,
[01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:18.520]   "Oh, this has bezels.
[01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:20.080]   It must be a piece of crap.
[01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:21.440]   Bezels are fine.
[01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:22.440]   They're wonderful.
[01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:26.360]   I know, but when you see them and you've been using, it's mostly on phones, Andy, but
[01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:33.240]   when you see a big bezel and you've been using bezel, you suddenly go, "Oh, that's
[01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:34.240]   disappointing."
[01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:36.440]   I'll give you that on the duo.
[01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:40.080]   I'll also give you that on the eighth generation iPad, which we'll be talking about later,
[01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:45.320]   I'm sure, because now that does seem a little bit weird to have all that headroom and footroom.
[01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:51.720]   But I really do think that having some air, so to speak, between the live screen and the
[01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:53.760]   actual display is a good thing.
[01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:54.760]   You need to be able to hold it.
[01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:57.240]   The phone, you can hold it, it's okay.
[01:11:57.240 --> 01:11:58.560]   You can hold it by the edges.
[01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:02.920]   But a tablet, you need to hold like you're holding a steering wheel.
[01:12:02.920 --> 01:12:04.680]   I think you're exactly right on that.
[01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:05.680]   Yes.
[01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:12.520]   So, Neil, it's an iPad and the bezels are okay.
[01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:14.120]   Thank you smash mouth, Doc Rock.
[01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:16.360]   Now I know why you got that name.
[01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:18.760]   Doc Rock, you're throwing out your GoPros.
[01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:20.720]   You're throwing out all your DSLRs.
[01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:23.320]   You're getting rid of the Canon, the Nikon, the Sony.
[01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:26.840]   It's all Apple iPhone all the time, right?
[01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:30.120]   You first dumped your name with every source.
[01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:32.680]   Swearing at me with all those words except Sony.
[01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:34.800]   I'm a Sony guy too.
[01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:36.200]   I know what you mean.
[01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:37.200]   So, yeah.
[01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:39.320]   So here's why this is a big deal.
[01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:40.880]   I'm an Ecamm guy, right?
[01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:42.880]   I teach Ecamm on my stream.
[01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:46.720]   I tell everybody if you just want to start, it's the easiest way to do it.
[01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:51.880]   One of the coolest features of Ecamm is you can just plug in an iPhone and it immediately
[01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:52.880]   works.
[01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:56.080]   If you want to start, you have no other cameras but your iPhone.
[01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:59.840]   The fact that you can just cable it up right away with the standard lightning cable and
[01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:01.400]   you're good to go is amazing.
[01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:04.760]   Now you take that and you add in this new camera.
[01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:09.160]   You add in this HDR 10 bit on the fly shooting.
[01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:10.400]   Oh my goodness.
[01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:13.760]   Now tell me what that means is a incredible stuff.
[01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:23.160]   As a videographer, they said, and to me this sounded amazing, 60 frame per second, 4K HDR
[01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:25.120]   10 bit with Dolby Vision.
[01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:28.000]   Now that's five buzz words in there.
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:33.160]   But all at the same time, is that good?
[01:13:33.160 --> 01:13:36.560]   Yes, yes, yes.
[01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:41.440]   So your bid definition covers a bunch of different things.
[01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:48.440]   And primarily, we're looking at dynamic range and we're talking about dynamic range on all
[01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:50.280]   the levels of the bits.
[01:13:50.280 --> 01:13:52.800]   So one of your forces is your RGBs.
[01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:56.920]   One of your forces is the huge saturation and luminance.
[01:13:56.920 --> 01:14:01.800]   One of your force is based off of depth color.
[01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:07.400]   Basically, it's your dynamic range, your shadows and your highlights and things like that.
[01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:11.280]   So the more bits you store, the more information about the senior story.
[01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:12.280]   Absolutely.
[01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:19.280]   And so therefore you have more ability to, when you go to edit, set photo or edit, set
[01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:21.440]   video, you have more that you're working with.
[01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:23.480]   This is why we all love RAW.
[01:14:23.480 --> 01:14:29.520]   So when you're shooting in say video RAW on any camera or things like the black magic
[01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:30.920]   camera and stuff like that.
[01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:32.320]   Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:33.400]   It's still compressed, right?
[01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:35.120]   You can't shoot RAW video.
[01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:39.160]   For the iPhone, it will be compressed.
[01:14:39.160 --> 01:14:40.840]   It will be straight RAW video.
[01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:41.840]   Is it 444?
[01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:44.200]   Yeah, no, no, you wouldn't have the room for it.
[01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:47.120]   Yeah, that itself it will burn out.
[01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:53.480]   So it is going to probably be in the ATIC Kodak or the X ABC Kodak, which is still somewhat
[01:14:53.480 --> 01:14:54.480]   so very good.
[01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:55.480]   But these are good.
[01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:56.480]   Yes, no.
[01:14:56.480 --> 01:14:57.480]   You watch it all day every day.
[01:14:57.480 --> 01:14:58.480]   MP5.
[01:14:58.480 --> 01:14:59.480]   Yeah.
[01:14:59.480 --> 01:15:00.480]   You even think about it.
[01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:01.480]   Yeah.
[01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:02.480]   You know what I'm saying?
[01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:07.920]   It's a piece of squashing something down or squeeze as my friend Diana would say, squeezing
[01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:13.040]   things down to like the MP3, original MP3 format.
[01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:14.440]   It just sounds like rubbish.
[01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:18.320]   I mean, we're at a whole different game in space with compression and things like that
[01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:19.760]   now.
[01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:26.440]   And the fact that for the most part, you can take what is the proxy footage out of Sony
[01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:28.400]   camera, how you can shoot dual mode.
[01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:31.880]   You can take the proxy footage, edit it, and throw it up online and nobody would even
[01:15:31.880 --> 01:15:32.880]   notice.
[01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:33.880]   Yes.
[01:15:33.880 --> 01:15:34.880]   Yes.
[01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:35.880]   Maybe like, oh, this is great.
[01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:39.000]   So, like, do you want to do this with an iPhone though?
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:40.000]   I mean, bro.
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:43.960]   I wish I could return my GoPro I just got.
[01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:45.720]   The hero, whatever, he, black.
[01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:46.720]   You can't.
[01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:48.400]   You didn't get it from Costco.
[01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:50.800]   Because honestly, I don't know if I needed any more.
[01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:54.760]   This iPhone, it sounds like, you know what I was waiting for at the end?
[01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:57.440]   They didn't do it, but I was waiting for Apple to say, and by the way, this entire
[01:15:57.440 --> 01:16:04.440]   presentation was shot on iPhone.
[01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:06.640]   That video, then, you know, okay, let's get to straight people.
[01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:07.920]   Do not get it twisted.
[01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:11.640]   You're not going to get your iPhone home and shoot with a shot there.
[01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:12.640]   Okay.
[01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:17.120]   The number one thing that they have that you do not have, okay, you can buy a home for
[01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:21.960]   or as an Osmo mobile for, you can buy a movie, send them a robot, you can get that balance,
[01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:23.480]   you can get all of that covered.
[01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:29.280]   But they're bringing 10K light, you know, big HDMI light, right?
[01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:34.080]   So even the stuff that they shot at night, there's probably some practical light somewhere
[01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:36.360]   to give it that extra boost.
[01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:40.920]   But you can do that right now, Prime Day, if you don't buy anything, you're into video
[01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:42.680]   creation by lights.
[01:16:42.680 --> 01:16:45.960]   The way anything else, everything else is not going to help you.
[01:16:45.960 --> 01:16:47.680]   Light is boom.
[01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:52.320]   Like this light right here that gives me all of this, you know, Genesquah, you know, that's
[01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:54.520]   like a $1,500 light.
[01:16:54.520 --> 01:16:58.480]   But it's because when you go to stream, it looks good, right?
[01:16:58.480 --> 01:17:00.760]   You can make this all ugly dude look good.
[01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:04.560]   So that and that Boston hat, come on.
[01:17:04.560 --> 01:17:05.920]   I'm really excited.
[01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:06.920]   I mean, that's one thing.
[01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:12.640]   And I have to say at this point with Google kind of, you know, they left the image processing
[01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:14.640]   hardware out of the Nipixel 5.
[01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:19.480]   I feel like they're in effect kind of saying, yeah, go ahead, Apple.
[01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:22.080]   And you could say, well, what about Samsung?
[01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:25.960]   Samsung has a lot of capability, but they are very opinionated about what they do to
[01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:27.760]   your photography.
[01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:34.280]   And I think unless you like that Samsung look, it is not a natural look.
[01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:38.240]   What the iPhone is going to give you is the best, most realistic photos.
[01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:42.240]   They're supporting some, by the way, this is some video on the website.
[01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:46.000]   There's no point in me streaming it at 720p, highly compressed.
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:47.440]   Go look at it at the website.
[01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:53.000]   If you were able to, if you have an Apple TV 4K and you have a 4K TV, I would, I'm going
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:56.720]   to go home and watch the event on 4K because I think you'll see a lot better.
[01:17:56.720 --> 01:17:58.160]   That's how I watched it.
[01:17:58.160 --> 01:17:59.160]   Yeah.
[01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:00.320]   Because I was, I was working the living room.
[01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:03.520]   I did not, I did not anticipate it being as cinematic as it was.
[01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:09.600]   And boy, did the photo and did the photo and video demos really hit home on a 4K 60 inch
[01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:10.600]   HDR TV.
[01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:14.400]   It's the first, they say first camera ever to record in Dolby vision.
[01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:16.120]   That's an HDR format.
[01:18:16.120 --> 01:18:20.920]   The playback, it supports all three HDR formats.
[01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:23.800]   I don't, I don't think any other phone does that.
[01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:27.280]   The iPhone 11 was eight bit HDR.
[01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:31.000]   This is 10 bit HDR.
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:35.680]   Dolby vision is, you know, stunning.
[01:18:35.680 --> 01:18:40.840]   The screen now, they're even calling it an XDR screen to kind of emphasize that you're
[01:18:40.840 --> 01:18:42.680]   going to get the brightness.
[01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:49.000]   The, the knits were super high, the resolution, almost 500 pixels per inch.
[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:50.360]   And you're going to get the HDR.
[01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:53.760]   So you're going to look at that screen and you're going to see what you shot.
[01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:55.800]   And it's going to look fantastic.
[01:18:55.800 --> 01:19:00.160]   I think this is an amazing camera.
[01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:06.720]   I think Apple, Apple is now making perhaps the best, certainly the best phone camera
[01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:07.720]   out there.
[01:19:07.720 --> 01:19:11.120]   And I suspect it's a camera that's going to compete even with DSLRs.
[01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:16.640]   They're offering something now called Pro Raw or Will Be, which gives you all of the bits
[01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:17.720]   off the sensor.
[01:19:17.720 --> 01:19:26.320]   That's the raw part, but also saves the computational data, the fusion engine, all the Apple image.
[01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:31.600]   Yeah, the pipeline data, which means, and it with, you know, obviously you're going to
[01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:33.120]   have to get an app that'll support this.
[01:19:33.120 --> 01:19:37.600]   I'm sure Apple's will makes you wonder if they should have kept aperture around.
[01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:40.800]   Although they did point out that Photoshop Adobe Photoshop will support it.
[01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:43.120]   I imagine Lightroom will support it.
[01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:44.120]   That's Luminar.
[01:19:44.120 --> 01:19:45.400]   You think Luminar, I'll do it.
[01:19:45.400 --> 01:19:46.400]   I hope so.
[01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:47.400]   Scott, we'll do it.
[01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:48.640]   Those boys are super, super quick.
[01:19:48.640 --> 01:19:52.960]   And then on the iPhone, you can know right away that Pro camera and I have to give a
[01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:55.080]   shout out to Umi Workshop, who's in the chat.
[01:19:55.080 --> 01:19:56.560]   He's their designer for that.
[01:19:56.560 --> 01:19:59.120]   Makes all the buttons acute.
[01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:03.720]   That that Pro camera app is already one of the dopest apps for the iPhone.
[01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:06.800]   So be able to do photo raw with that app.
[01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:09.520]   You're going to be basically like having a mirrorless camera.
[01:20:09.520 --> 01:20:12.840]   And Apple did say we have, there is a kit.
[01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:15.320]   We will expose all of the features of this camera.
[01:20:15.320 --> 01:20:17.840]   So third party camera apps can use it.
[01:20:17.840 --> 01:20:25.160]   Boy, I tell you, this is going to be, they're clearly they've pinpointed that photographer.
[01:20:25.160 --> 01:20:29.440]   They didn't even mention that you can make phone calls with this, by the way.
[01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:31.840]   They didn't show messages.
[01:20:31.840 --> 01:20:34.160]   They didn't show anything else.
[01:20:34.160 --> 01:20:35.400]   They didn't run apps.
[01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:37.680]   They, you know, they spent a little time with gaming.
[01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:41.720]   I think this was kind of their response to losing Fortnite.
[01:20:41.720 --> 01:20:44.240]   They said, oh, and now you can play League of Legends.
[01:20:44.240 --> 01:20:49.520]   It's like you play last year's game if you want.
[01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:50.520]   And oh, we have.
[01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:52.520]   That was nit picky.
[01:20:52.520 --> 01:20:55.000]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:20:55.000 --> 01:21:01.360]   I do have to say though, that demonstration and all of this camera stuff is really flexing
[01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:03.280]   the Apple Silicon.
[01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:09.320]   What they are really saying is you have a phone, you have a six core four GPU phone
[01:21:09.320 --> 01:21:11.200]   in your pocket.
[01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:16.640]   We can make, we can put in that chip 11.8 billion transistors.
[01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:17.920]   Hey, Richie is here.
[01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:22.480]   He was on Twitter on Sunday, but I think there's a little more you could talk about today from
[01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:23.480]   youtube.com/r.
[01:21:23.480 --> 01:21:26.480]   Look at that Mac mini in his hot little hands.
[01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:29.200]   Oh, I want it so badly to tell you that we could talk about it on Tuesday.
[01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:31.040]   I know I can think very seriously.
[01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:37.240]   And you were good and Apple should know you honored your embargo with verve gusto and
[01:21:37.240 --> 01:21:38.240]   integrity.
[01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:40.440]   So we have at least a hounds now.
[01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:45.480]   So yeah, I noticed when I got up this morning, quite a few reviews of Apple Silicon max,
[01:21:45.480 --> 01:21:49.000]   both the Mac book air, the Mac mini and the Mac book pro 13 and a knock.
[01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.160]   Also here from WGBH Boston.
[01:21:51.160 --> 01:21:52.960]   Good to see you Andrew.
[01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:53.960]   Good to see all of you again.
[01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:55.280]   Good to have the whole team back.
[01:21:55.280 --> 01:21:56.280]   Yep.
[01:21:56.280 --> 01:22:02.840]   And of course, Lori Gill, who I think also might have a little something.
[01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:03.840]   Not yet.
[01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:07.280]   No, my comes Friday.
[01:22:07.280 --> 01:22:10.640]   I've got a little I checked because you said right check.
[01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:16.600]   It was they were saying it will come on Tuesday a week from today on the 24th and I just checked.
[01:22:16.600 --> 01:22:20.280]   And I am UPS tells me it will be coming this Friday.
[01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:21.800]   Some people got them today.
[01:22:21.800 --> 01:22:22.800]   Some people got them really early.
[01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:23.800]   I know I saw that on.
[01:22:23.800 --> 01:22:24.800]   I read it a number of people.
[01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:33.280]   And of course, the review units, how long did you get it the day of Renee?
[01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:35.360]   I forget because FedEx was delayed for me.
[01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:40.440]   They had something it's like it's on Twitter where you see all the reviewers just complaining
[01:22:40.440 --> 01:22:44.160]   about FedEx and you're pretty certain something's arriving that day.
[01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:45.560]   Yeah.
[01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:49.120]   So you got it, but you've had it for almost a week then.
[01:22:49.120 --> 01:22:52.600]   Yeah, I've had it since I think there is Wednesday or Thursday.
[01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:53.600]   Okay.
[01:22:53.600 --> 01:22:56.520]   Why don't you have time to say benchmark it.
[01:22:56.520 --> 01:22:58.720]   Oh, I benchmarked this.
[01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:02.080]   I did the stonks version of benchmarking Leo because I knew that's only the only thing
[01:23:02.080 --> 01:23:03.080]   anyone would be asking.
[01:23:03.080 --> 01:23:07.280]   So I did the geek benches, the center benches, the GFX anything that with the word bench
[01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:08.520]   in it, I think I did a park bench.
[01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:10.080]   There's a lot of these benchmarks.
[01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:14.920]   There is a geek bench native M one benchmark, but a lot of these benchmarks are not their
[01:23:14.920 --> 01:23:15.920]   Intel benchmarks.
[01:23:15.920 --> 01:23:20.040]   So you'd be really benchmarking Rosetta to as much as anything else.
[01:23:20.040 --> 01:23:25.840]   I will hold off, let me hold off on your thoughts while we just summarize what we're
[01:23:25.840 --> 01:23:33.800]   seeing from Matthew panzerino on tech crunch from ours, Technica from a Neelite Patel at
[01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:38.720]   the verge, actually the verge had all three and had three different reviewers test all
[01:23:38.720 --> 01:23:41.080]   of them.
[01:23:41.080 --> 01:23:50.600]   And senses from everybody is whoa, these things, these things are fast.
[01:23:50.600 --> 01:23:55.360]   And of course, Matthew, who did a lot of battery testing, amazing battery.
[01:23:55.360 --> 01:23:57.640]   Whoops, I pushed the wrong button there.
[01:23:57.640 --> 01:24:01.640]   Amazing battery life as well.
[01:24:01.640 --> 01:24:02.640]   Apple's new.
[01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:03.640]   This is Matthew panzerino.
[01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:09.240]   Apple's new M one powered MacBook shows impressive performance gains that make Intel's
[01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:12.760]   chips obsolete overnight.
[01:24:12.760 --> 01:24:16.600]   Is that hyperbole in your opinion or name?
[01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:18.320]   So I managed to get all three of them as well.
[01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:19.480]   And I've been testing them all weekend.
[01:24:19.480 --> 01:24:22.040]   And there is one area that Intel still dominates.
[01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:26.160]   And I said this in my video, if you need your coffee cup kept warm by your Mac mini,
[01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:31.320]   if you need to use your MacBook Pro as a heat blanket in the winter, then you are still
[01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:35.800]   going to have to go with Intel because I pushed these things like 30 minute loops, everything
[01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:37.240]   I could do.
[01:24:37.240 --> 01:24:38.760]   And they barely get hot.
[01:24:38.760 --> 01:24:43.680]   Like it took me 10 minutes to get the MacBook Airs fan to come on and it was hard to get
[01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:48.160]   the MacBook Air to down ramp and to get the MacBook Pros fan to even come on.
[01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:53.800]   And even then it was whisper quiet while the Intel Air and the Intel MacBook Pro were gasping
[01:24:53.800 --> 01:24:56.360]   for air like they'd been sucked out into space.
[01:24:56.360 --> 01:25:01.080]   This is a room and this animated gift from Matthew panzerino kind of tells the story.
[01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:03.440]   He is launching in succession.
[01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:07.240]   Each application in his dock, there is zero bouncing.
[01:25:07.240 --> 01:25:08.240]   They all launched.
[01:25:08.240 --> 01:25:09.920]   It's just once I was an iPad.
[01:25:09.920 --> 01:25:12.160]   It feels like having an iPad.
[01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:13.160]   Are these real launches though?
[01:25:13.160 --> 01:25:18.960]   Are they ready to run or is this one of those tricks where they stop bouncing and they've
[01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:22.000]   got they render a screen but it's not really usable yet?
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:23.200]   No, it depends on the app.
[01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:27.040]   Like Photoshop and Final Cut Pro will still take a few bounces but it's not like eight
[01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:28.040]   bounce.
[01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:29.760]   Like I made this joke and I thought it was a joke at first.
[01:25:29.760 --> 01:25:35.240]   I said like a movie trailer like imagine a world with no more bouncing.
[01:25:35.240 --> 01:25:37.000]   Imagine a world where you're not waiting.
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.360]   Imagine a world without beach balls.
[01:25:39.360 --> 01:25:41.200]   It would be beautiful.
[01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:44.360]   But that's really close to what I did not get a single beach ball.
[01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:49.000]   I did not get a stammer, a stutter in Final Cut Pro did not drop a frame.
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:54.240]   These are the low power, low end, worst of any machine that's ever going to come out.
[01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:57.800]   We should say this because on Sunday now you had this on Sunday but you couldn't tell
[01:25:57.800 --> 01:25:58.800]   anybody.
[01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:04.360]   You were talking with some knowledge of a forethought but the rest of us including Alex
[01:26:04.360 --> 01:26:05.960]   Lindsey were not.
[01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:09.320]   You and Alex kind of agreed that these are not really pro.
[01:26:09.320 --> 01:26:12.040]   Even the MacBook Pro is not pro.
[01:26:12.040 --> 01:26:16.480]   I think nobody would deny that there will be the next generation and the generation after
[01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:19.480]   that and they will get faster and faster and faster.
[01:26:19.480 --> 01:26:20.480]   Yes.
[01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:24.040]   I would have to say given what I've seen in the benchmarks, even given the performance
[01:26:24.040 --> 01:26:32.760]   with admittedly only 16 gigs of RAM that this MacBook Pro for instance outperformed the
[01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:37.160]   Mac Pro in some cases.
[01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:38.160]   Almost.
[01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:42.560]   The big constraint is going to be ports for people who are our legitimate pro users.
[01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:43.560]   You just can't without a hug.
[01:26:43.560 --> 01:26:45.400]   Get a freaking dog then.
[01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:46.400]   Yes.
[01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:51.440]   No, that's what the thing with the RAM is the machines these replaced only had 16 gigabytes.
[01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:52.440]   Apple was really good.
[01:26:52.440 --> 01:26:53.680]   They did memory compression.
[01:26:53.680 --> 01:26:55.160]   They did ultra fast swap.
[01:26:55.160 --> 01:26:59.800]   Now you have a unified memory pool which operates completely differently than a traditional
[01:26:59.800 --> 01:27:02.360]   VRAM and DRAM system.
[01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:04.240]   You're not copying things back and forth.
[01:27:04.240 --> 01:27:05.400]   Everything is instantly available.
[01:27:05.400 --> 01:27:11.080]   It's a pool and we're going to have to reconceptualize how we talk about RAM on a like it's like
[01:27:11.080 --> 01:27:12.320]   talking about it on an iPad now.
[01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:14.080]   It's not like talking about it on a traditional PC.
[01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:17.920]   That was my bet and I still haven't used it.
[01:27:17.920 --> 01:27:22.740]   My MacBook Pro 13 comes on Friday but that was my bet was that you shouldn't compare
[01:27:22.740 --> 01:27:26.320]   16 gigs of RAM on this device to an Intel device.
[01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:28.800]   Especially because of the unified memory architecture.
[01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:37.960]   Panzareno even goes so far as to say, "I think Apple might phase out the notion of RAM entirely."
[01:27:37.960 --> 01:27:43.920]   You might have some sort of shared storage/RAM, some sort of obtain wouldn't be obtained.
[01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:46.040]   It's like an IBM dream for years, right?
[01:27:46.040 --> 01:27:49.240]   Like maybe a patent itself that for years but it could be possible.
[01:27:49.240 --> 01:27:56.040]   You might have up to two terabytes of RAM, let's say, except that it's RAM plus storage
[01:27:56.040 --> 01:28:01.680]   and because it's on chip, it's all equally fast.
[01:28:01.680 --> 01:28:08.800]   I just want to say, my guess was at this even before the announcement last week but at the
[01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:14.640]   announcement for sure that this was an inflection point in desktop computing.
[01:28:14.640 --> 01:28:19.920]   That everything was going to be before Apple Silicon and after Apple Silicon.
[01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:24.320]   I don't see anything at all to doubt that assessment.
[01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:30.160]   This is now, Andy, you pointed out that a number of the Intel fanboys on YouTube and
[01:28:30.160 --> 01:28:37.360]   elsewhere, Lewis Rossman and people like that, are saying, "What is their complaint?"
[01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:42.840]   A lot of their complaint is that they're, I think they took Umbridge at the, "Hey, this
[01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:48.040]   is faster than 98% of all Windows laptops released in the past year."
[01:28:48.040 --> 01:28:52.120]   Yeah, that's marketing lingo but they didn't really focus on the actual performance of
[01:28:52.120 --> 01:28:53.440]   this actual thing.
[01:28:53.440 --> 01:28:59.360]   They're also complaining about RAM expandability but they're also complaining about the GPU
[01:28:59.360 --> 01:29:02.360]   performance is not going to be as good as a dedicated GPU.
[01:29:02.360 --> 01:29:06.640]   Well, wait a minute because hold your, they obviously hadn't benchmarked it yet.
[01:29:06.640 --> 01:29:12.240]   Yeah, I mean a lot, but really to sum up, a lot of this really sounds familiar to the
[01:29:12.240 --> 01:29:16.240]   first Mac that was released and the first iPad that was released where they're trying
[01:29:16.240 --> 01:29:23.560]   to compare it to a stand, they're trying to compare it to the architecture and the sort
[01:29:23.560 --> 01:29:29.240]   of devices that they're used to when it's really, really becoming clear that Apple didn't
[01:29:29.240 --> 01:29:32.240]   just swap from one processor to another.
[01:29:32.240 --> 01:29:39.000]   They reinvented the Mac from the ground up and so there was going to be, as people continue
[01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:43.640]   to use these things, they're certainly going to be able to find, I'm sure, or rather,
[01:29:43.640 --> 01:29:48.600]   I have to believe, despite all immediate evidence that they're going to find areas in which
[01:29:48.600 --> 01:29:54.160]   this new M1 CPU is not the one ring to rule them all.
[01:29:54.160 --> 01:29:59.920]   But the thing is, as you say, it feels more like an iPad because it was designed more
[01:29:59.920 --> 01:30:02.280]   like an iPad, not just a CPU swap.
[01:30:02.280 --> 01:30:05.760]   I don't like the feels more like an iPad because that implies that somehow it's less
[01:30:05.760 --> 01:30:07.120]   than desktop computing.
[01:30:07.120 --> 01:30:09.120]   This is instantaneous though.
[01:30:09.120 --> 01:30:11.200]   The iPad is so responsive.
[01:30:11.200 --> 01:30:12.200]   To me, that's the thing.
[01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:16.640]   Whenever somebody says, "I wish I had Final Cut Pro on the iPad," I try to figure out
[01:30:16.640 --> 01:30:21.720]   what do they actually mean and there's a responsiveness and immediacy and instantality,
[01:30:21.720 --> 01:30:23.920]   instantaneous-nality to the iPad.
[01:30:23.920 --> 01:30:25.480]   You press something, it happens.
[01:30:25.480 --> 01:30:26.480]   You're never waiting.
[01:30:26.480 --> 01:30:28.400]   It never feels like it's beach balling.
[01:30:28.400 --> 01:30:32.080]   It feels like it's doing exactly what you want the second your fingers touch it.
[01:30:32.080 --> 01:30:35.720]   For the first time, that's what these Macs feel like.
[01:30:35.720 --> 01:30:38.440]   It's not just that, yes, the performance is outlandish.
[01:30:38.440 --> 01:30:42.760]   The battery life, I ran all my benchmarks on battery.
[01:30:42.760 --> 01:30:47.600]   The MacBook Air MacBook Pro were down to like 68 and 70 percent and the Intel ones were
[01:30:47.600 --> 01:30:50.000]   like 27 percent and 40 percent.
[01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:54.280]   But beyond even that, it just felt like I was getting slices of my life back.
[01:30:54.280 --> 01:30:57.800]   Just using Final Cut, without every time I go over a plug-in, it spins.
[01:30:57.800 --> 01:31:00.880]   Without every time I go over something, it stops to render without it having to load
[01:31:00.880 --> 01:31:05.760]   and not like it was like getting seconds and minutes of my life back and I was just smiling
[01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:07.520]   the whole time.
[01:31:07.520 --> 01:31:13.080]   But Laurie, can you hold your breath and wait?
[01:31:13.080 --> 01:31:18.880]   So I'm thinking about things like, so World of Warcraft just recently announced that they
[01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:19.880]   are already set up.
[01:31:19.880 --> 01:31:22.240]   Out of the box.
[01:31:22.240 --> 01:31:24.240]   Yeah.
[01:31:24.240 --> 01:31:29.200]   It made me think of things like, everybody knows that Macs aren't meant for gaming.
[01:31:29.200 --> 01:31:35.960]   But now I'm starting to think maybe Macs can be meant for gaming right now.
[01:31:35.960 --> 01:31:42.280]   Maybe this is opening up a whole new world in terms of what is possible on a Mac and
[01:31:42.280 --> 01:31:45.960]   whether or not people would be interested in playing games on a Mac.
[01:31:45.960 --> 01:31:52.480]   A lot of it has been limitations in what the Mac could do in terms of a dedicated GPU and
[01:31:52.480 --> 01:31:53.480]   things like that.
[01:31:53.480 --> 01:31:55.320]   So I don't know.
[01:31:55.320 --> 01:31:58.760]   It seems it's crazy.
[01:31:58.760 --> 01:32:03.400]   Single threaded performance better than almost anything including.
[01:32:03.400 --> 01:32:04.400]   Maybe Ryzen 3.
[01:32:04.400 --> 01:32:06.400]   Maybe Ryzen 3.
[01:32:06.400 --> 01:32:07.400]   Yeah.
[01:32:07.400 --> 01:32:15.840]   I mean, just even for mobile, this is a killer, but even for not mobile, for desktop, this
[01:32:15.840 --> 01:32:16.840]   is a killer.
[01:32:16.840 --> 01:32:19.480]   Web kit render speeds were ridiculous.
[01:32:19.480 --> 01:32:22.000]   Multi-threading is also very strong.
[01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:23.720]   Multi-core is very strong.
[01:32:23.720 --> 01:32:27.760]   And I think the GPUs are stronger than people thought too.
[01:32:27.760 --> 01:32:29.600]   Is that been your experience Renee?
[01:32:29.600 --> 01:32:30.600]   Yeah.
[01:32:30.600 --> 01:32:34.120]   I mean, so the fairly better than any other integrated graphics.
[01:32:34.120 --> 01:32:35.120]   I mean, if you're.
[01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:36.120]   Yes.
[01:32:36.120 --> 01:32:37.120]   I suppose it's going to say like compared to Intel.
[01:32:37.120 --> 01:32:38.120]   Yeah.
[01:32:38.120 --> 01:32:39.120]   Yeah.
[01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:41.440]   It's like it runs laps around it then goes and does calisthetics in the middle of the field
[01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:44.040]   while it's waiting for the Intel ones to finish.
[01:32:44.040 --> 01:32:47.880]   Like again, like some people are like, well, you didn't compare it to our DNA two.
[01:32:47.880 --> 01:32:50.000]   You didn't compare it to Ampere.
[01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:53.880]   And it makes me want to do a wellness check for our slash Android, sorry, our slash hardware
[01:32:53.880 --> 01:32:58.640]   at that point because those are like $1000 cards with literally the shield alloc carrier
[01:32:58.640 --> 01:33:00.040]   as their ventilation.
[01:33:00.040 --> 01:33:03.040]   You know, those are 300 watts of power draw.
[01:33:03.040 --> 01:33:07.000]   This is this is literally a low power system and it's doing performance that no longer
[01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:08.560]   makes you regret.
[01:33:08.560 --> 01:33:12.480]   It's like the MacBook Air just feels like you're not making any compromises anymore and with
[01:33:12.480 --> 01:33:15.480]   zero fan and that's pretty amazing.
[01:33:15.480 --> 01:33:21.680]   One of the things that distinguished 2020 for me anyway was at the end of the year, Apple
[01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:24.520]   kept announcing new products.
[01:33:24.520 --> 01:33:26.400]   First it was in a new iPad.
[01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:29.520]   Then it was new iPhones and it was new computers.
[01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:32.200]   It seems like there was always one more thing.
[01:33:32.200 --> 01:33:33.200]   Let's take a look.
[01:33:33.200 --> 01:33:38.080]   The long rumored AirPods Max came out.
[01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:46.280]   But before I tell you all the features, cut to the bottom line $549.
[01:33:46.280 --> 01:33:48.480]   Whoa, that seems a lot.
[01:33:48.480 --> 01:33:50.000]   That's the cheapest you can get on there.
[01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:51.480]   That's a lot of money.
[01:33:51.480 --> 01:33:52.480]   Yes.
[01:33:52.480 --> 01:33:54.360]   Merlin, that's a lot of money.
[01:33:54.360 --> 01:33:56.160]   It seems expensive.
[01:33:56.160 --> 01:33:57.880]   How much are they Bose quiet comforts?
[01:33:57.880 --> 01:33:59.920]   Because that's what they're going up against, right?
[01:33:59.920 --> 01:34:01.680]   They're all like $303.50.
[01:34:01.680 --> 01:34:02.680]   The Sony is...
[01:34:02.680 --> 01:34:03.680]   Yeah, the Sony says...
[01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:06.880]   There are headphones that are more expensive than this.
[01:34:06.880 --> 01:34:09.200]   You can spend a ludicrous amount of money on audio.
[01:34:09.200 --> 01:34:11.600]   You can buy a million dollar set-ups and they'll offer to sell you accessories.
[01:34:11.600 --> 01:34:13.040]   I'll be the last but I think most people...
[01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:14.040]   But I think most people...
[01:34:14.040 --> 01:34:15.040]   ...is expensive headphones.
[01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:20.000]   I have a pair of very expensive high-fi man headphones that are great because instead
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:23.560]   of buying a very, very fancy stereo, if you get really, really good headphones and a
[01:34:23.560 --> 01:34:26.440]   good input, you can get great sound.
[01:34:26.440 --> 01:34:30.600]   These high-fi men, which are magnetic planar technology, sound great, but that's not what
[01:34:30.600 --> 01:34:31.600]   these are.
[01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:33.000]   Most people don't know those.
[01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.760]   The biggest issue for me with this is most people have no idea that those headphones
[01:34:35.760 --> 01:34:36.760]   exist.
[01:34:36.760 --> 01:34:39.240]   For most people, the high-end are like the Sony's and the Bose.
[01:34:39.240 --> 01:34:45.120]   And for Apple, Apple they look at as an affordable luxury brand and then when Apple only introduces
[01:34:45.120 --> 01:34:48.920]   the high-end, like if they only introduce the Mac Pro and there's no Mac Mini or they
[01:34:48.920 --> 01:34:55.560]   only have an iPhone XS and it's not the iPhone 11, you feel like that compact has been broken
[01:34:55.560 --> 01:34:58.880]   and they're only giving you the luxury and you want them and you can't afford them and
[01:34:58.880 --> 01:35:00.520]   you get really angry, really fast.
[01:35:00.520 --> 01:35:02.600]   ScooterX says, "No, come on, guys.
[01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:03.600]   It's simple.
[01:35:03.600 --> 01:35:09.080]   Buy a Mac Pro and a Pro Display XDR on your Apple card and the cash back, you could buy
[01:35:09.080 --> 01:35:10.080]   the headphones.
[01:35:10.080 --> 01:35:11.080]   Free."
[01:35:11.080 --> 01:35:13.880]   I mean, they're computationally like they have a bunch of technology inside them that is
[01:35:13.880 --> 01:35:19.080]   expensive but people aren't used to paying for the accelerometer and the gyroscope and
[01:35:19.080 --> 01:35:21.760]   the eight different microphones and the...
[01:35:21.760 --> 01:35:25.960]   There's two H1 Apple Silicon 10-core audio processors.
[01:35:25.960 --> 01:35:28.320]   Nobody who buys headphones is used to be the same kind of thing.
[01:35:28.320 --> 01:35:30.920]   Each cup has its own 10-core processor.
[01:35:30.920 --> 01:35:32.760]   Its own 10-core system in-tack.
[01:35:32.760 --> 01:35:34.760]   It's like an Apple.
[01:35:34.760 --> 01:35:37.920]   See, that's the problem that Apple's up against.
[01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:38.920]   Nobody is...
[01:35:38.920 --> 01:35:43.120]   I think the HomePod really proved that nobody is impressed with all the stuff you put into
[01:35:43.120 --> 01:35:44.360]   the press release.
[01:35:44.360 --> 01:35:49.280]   All they care about is maybe you put $1,000 worth of incredible technology into this.
[01:35:49.280 --> 01:35:55.040]   If it only sounds $8 more expensive than something that costs half as much, you lose.
[01:35:55.040 --> 01:36:00.200]   I think that most people are going to regard this as a set of headphones for...
[01:36:00.200 --> 01:36:03.960]   I mean, that's in a positive way, for audio muggles.
[01:36:03.960 --> 01:36:07.080]   People who are just like, "I want headphones that sound good.
[01:36:07.080 --> 01:36:08.080]   I want them to be...
[01:36:08.080 --> 01:36:09.920]   You have really good noise canceling.
[01:36:09.920 --> 01:36:13.520]   I want them to sound really, really great."
[01:36:13.520 --> 01:36:19.240]   Once you get into the rarefied era of $550, yes, there are headphones that cost you a
[01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:21.960]   lot of money, but these are for the audio files.
[01:36:21.960 --> 01:36:26.400]   I'm not sure if the audio files are going to think that these headphones are in their
[01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:27.400]   class.
[01:36:27.400 --> 01:36:29.160]   Well, it remains to be seen.
[01:36:29.160 --> 01:36:30.160]   But I just...
[01:36:30.160 --> 01:36:31.160]   So that's the question.
[01:36:31.160 --> 01:36:35.280]   If you do these sound $550 good.
[01:36:35.280 --> 01:36:37.560]   If they did, I don't care about the technology, they've got to sound...
[01:36:37.560 --> 01:36:39.920]   You may have that much brand cache.
[01:36:39.920 --> 01:36:43.760]   So this is for who?
[01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:46.760]   I mean, this could be a game on the show.
[01:36:46.760 --> 01:36:48.920]   Trickleo into buying these.
[01:36:48.920 --> 01:36:50.920]   Oh, we just got to wait.
[01:36:50.920 --> 01:36:51.920]   We just got to wait.
[01:36:51.920 --> 01:36:55.520]   I mean, the most basic thing, Leo, you need it for your work.
[01:36:55.520 --> 01:36:57.280]   No, no, no, no.
[01:36:57.280 --> 01:36:58.280]   My work is broke.
[01:36:58.280 --> 01:36:59.280]   Right, try to work for me.
[01:36:59.280 --> 01:37:00.280]   It was really broke.
[01:37:00.280 --> 01:37:01.280]   I can't.
[01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:03.880]   In fact, the reason I can't buy this is because we don't have any money.
[01:37:03.880 --> 01:37:05.600]   So that's not going to work.
[01:37:05.600 --> 01:37:06.600]   So you really...
[01:37:06.600 --> 01:37:09.040]   You're the author of Secret Santa and you truly owe me.
[01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:10.280]   Oh, there you go.
[01:37:10.280 --> 01:37:11.280]   No pressure.
[01:37:11.280 --> 01:37:14.360]   I should tell Lisa this is what I want for Christmas.
[01:37:14.360 --> 01:37:16.240]   So who is it for?
[01:37:16.240 --> 01:37:17.240]   Is that the question?
[01:37:17.240 --> 01:37:23.840]   Or is should I get excited about a unique dual neodymium ring magnet motor?
[01:37:23.840 --> 01:37:25.840]   Sounds good.
[01:37:25.840 --> 01:37:26.840]   How is it rare?
[01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:27.840]   It's rare earth.
[01:37:27.840 --> 01:37:28.840]   It's rare earth.
[01:37:28.840 --> 01:37:29.840]   It's rare earth.
[01:37:29.840 --> 01:37:34.680]   You don't know how many barefoot children in Botswana were involved in the manufacturer
[01:37:34.680 --> 01:37:35.680]   of this.
[01:37:35.680 --> 01:37:36.680]   It could have been...
[01:37:36.680 --> 01:37:38.600]   That's expensive stuff.
[01:37:38.600 --> 01:37:43.720]   Actually, did Apple say now that they're getting their rare earth in economically, that can
[01:37:43.720 --> 01:37:44.720]   logically sustainably waste?
[01:37:44.720 --> 01:37:47.320]   I think they're working on reusing all the rare earth.
[01:37:47.320 --> 01:37:48.640]   I don't know how far they...
[01:37:48.640 --> 01:37:49.640]   Reusing.
[01:37:49.640 --> 01:37:51.360]   Repurposing I think is the term.
[01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:54.240]   Does it say if it does the spatial thing?
[01:37:54.240 --> 01:37:55.600]   Yes, it does spatial.
[01:37:55.600 --> 01:37:56.600]   It's spatial.
[01:37:56.600 --> 01:37:57.600]   I think that is magic.
[01:37:57.600 --> 01:38:00.160]   I mean, there's not much stuff you can use it for right now.
[01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:01.160]   Like I would...
[01:38:01.160 --> 01:38:06.360]   If I were watching Lord of the Rings on the TV and it would give me atmos in my head...
[01:38:06.360 --> 01:38:07.360]   It's different.
[01:38:07.360 --> 01:38:08.360]   It's different.
[01:38:08.360 --> 01:38:09.360]   So the TV is static.
[01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:10.360]   It doesn't move.
[01:38:10.360 --> 01:38:11.840]   And the air pods are different because...
[01:38:11.840 --> 01:38:14.920]   So with the TV, you're sitting in front of the TV and regardless of how you move, you
[01:38:14.920 --> 01:38:16.960]   expect it to come from the TV.
[01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:17.960]   But with the...
[01:38:17.960 --> 01:38:19.960]   You find yourself doing this a lot to test it out.
[01:38:19.960 --> 01:38:20.960]   You know?
[01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:21.960]   Do this.
[01:38:21.960 --> 01:38:22.960]   But the crazy part is...
[01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:24.600]   As I turned it, I finally got the firmware update.
[01:38:24.600 --> 01:38:26.240]   I was so excited to try this.
[01:38:26.240 --> 01:38:28.800]   And you notice I've been so cool when you go, "It's not working."
[01:38:28.800 --> 01:38:29.800]   Honestly.
[01:38:29.800 --> 01:38:32.200]   Because at first you go like, "Oh, it's not working."
[01:38:32.200 --> 01:38:33.760]   Which means it's so subtle.
[01:38:33.760 --> 01:38:36.120]   But you do this and you're like, "Ah, that's a witch.
[01:38:36.120 --> 01:38:37.280]   There's a witch in my iPad.
[01:38:37.280 --> 01:38:38.280]   What's happening?"
[01:38:38.280 --> 01:38:40.440]   But it sounds so freaking cool.
[01:38:40.440 --> 01:38:43.160]   And it doesn't feel like a trick.
[01:38:43.160 --> 01:38:48.280]   With those kinds of things, it's sort of like when 3D movies came out and you could
[01:38:48.280 --> 01:38:51.160]   get a TV, they mentioned this on the Bike Check podcast recently.
[01:38:51.160 --> 01:38:55.440]   It used to be there was a 3D button where it simulates 3D on a non-3D film.
[01:38:55.440 --> 01:38:57.720]   And you're like, "Oh, that's not really the thing.
[01:38:57.720 --> 01:38:59.320]   That ain't it, chief."
[01:38:59.320 --> 01:39:02.280]   But when you put these things in, you're watching a movie.
[01:39:02.280 --> 01:39:04.160]   It sounds amazing.
[01:39:04.160 --> 01:39:06.440]   I mean subtle in the best possible way.
[01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:07.440]   You've tried it.
[01:39:07.440 --> 01:39:08.440]   Everybody's tried it here?
[01:39:08.440 --> 01:39:09.440]   I have not.
[01:39:09.440 --> 01:39:11.440]   I have AirPods Prose, but somewhere.
[01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:12.440]   It's a big difference.
[01:39:12.440 --> 01:39:13.440]   You can't find them.
[01:39:13.440 --> 01:39:18.680]   Because you've got the sensors in the AirPods and you've got them in the device.
[01:39:18.680 --> 01:39:22.680]   And so the gyroscopes and accelerometers communicate with each other.
[01:39:22.680 --> 01:39:25.320]   And if you're moving the iPad, like let's say you're watching like this and then you
[01:39:25.320 --> 01:39:29.320]   lean back, your expectation now is that the audio or you're just moving it sideways.
[01:39:29.320 --> 01:39:31.560]   The audio should still come from the person speaking.
[01:39:31.560 --> 01:39:35.160]   The center channels will still be the relative, not absolute center channel then.
[01:39:35.160 --> 01:39:38.800]   So as you move it around, it is adjusting where the audio is coming from so that it
[01:39:38.800 --> 01:39:42.440]   still feels like it's coming from the device you're holding, which just doesn't have to
[01:39:42.440 --> 01:39:45.120]   happen on a television set because that's a big static object.
[01:39:45.120 --> 01:39:47.040]   And it really messes your brain at first.
[01:39:47.040 --> 01:39:50.920]   And then once your brain locks onto it, that's your new expectation or everything else sounds
[01:39:50.920 --> 01:39:51.920]   broken.
[01:39:51.920 --> 01:39:57.200]   I went into my fancy 4K movies that I had on an iOS device.
[01:39:57.200 --> 01:40:01.360]   And I think I was doing Spider-Man into the Spiderverse.
[01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:04.400]   And it was pretty trippy first time.
[01:40:04.400 --> 01:40:05.400]   So it's like surround.
[01:40:05.400 --> 01:40:08.000]   It gives you surround sound, but they're in your headphones.
[01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:14.400]   And it's like a very, very, very very, very very very very very very very very very very.
[01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:17.920]   And then you're gonna be able to see the sound of the sound of the audio.
[01:40:17.920 --> 01:40:20.160]   And then you're gonna be able to see the sound of the audio.
[01:40:20.160 --> 01:40:22.920]   And then you're gonna be able to see the sound of the video.
[01:40:22.920 --> 01:40:25.600]   And then you're gonna be able to see the sound of the audio.
[01:40:25.600 --> 01:40:28.680]   And then you're gonna be able to see the sound of the audio.
[01:40:28.680 --> 01:40:32.320]   And then you're gonna be able to see the sound of the audio.
[01:40:32.320 --> 01:40:35.160]   And then you're gonna be able to see the sound of the audio.
[01:40:35.160 --> 01:40:39.720]   Like where my head is and where I'm turning relative to the actual device itself.
[01:40:39.720 --> 01:40:43.800]   They'll always get like beautiful like standard like balanced separation.
[01:40:43.800 --> 01:40:47.240]   So it's a wonderful piece of technological magic.
[01:40:47.240 --> 01:40:52.000]   But in terms of placing the audio as though it has the illusion of originating from the
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:55.160]   device is playing from, that's not something that I really value.
[01:40:55.160 --> 01:40:58.440]   You know what stays in place when you move your head around?
[01:40:58.440 --> 01:40:59.440]   TV speakers.
[01:40:59.440 --> 01:41:00.440]   Final.
[01:41:00.440 --> 01:41:01.440]   How are you gonna say final?
[01:41:01.440 --> 01:41:02.440]   Final.
[01:41:02.440 --> 01:41:03.440]   Yeah, final.
[01:41:03.440 --> 01:41:09.920]   So you're, see, I thought it was gonna simulate a surround system with the left, right behind
[01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:11.160]   me and up above me.
[01:41:11.160 --> 01:41:12.560]   And oh, it does do that.
[01:41:12.560 --> 01:41:13.560]   In addition to that.
[01:41:13.560 --> 01:41:15.240]   It's hard to describe its depth.
[01:41:15.240 --> 01:41:19.800]   It really it's, I am when you, the words you're using remind me of like, oh, it's quadraphonic.
[01:41:19.800 --> 01:41:21.240]   It sounds like it's all around you.
[01:41:21.240 --> 01:41:25.840]   And that's true to an extent, but it's just more like it sounds very, it sounds whatever
[01:41:25.840 --> 01:41:27.240]   route the room sound.
[01:41:27.240 --> 01:41:29.160]   What do you imagine the room you're watching on TV?
[01:41:29.160 --> 01:41:30.800]   That's like what it sounds like.
[01:41:30.800 --> 01:41:32.440]   And it doesn't feel gimmicky to me.
[01:41:32.440 --> 01:41:36.880]   I mean, obviously everybody's got their own preferences, but I think it's amazing and
[01:41:36.880 --> 01:41:37.880]   I can't wait.
[01:41:37.880 --> 01:41:42.840]   I can't, that alongside like being able to add a second pair of iPods, like when, like
[01:41:42.840 --> 01:41:46.560]   when my kid and I are watching, you know, the kind of media that my wife would just assume
[01:41:46.560 --> 01:41:50.960]   we not be watching, it's gonna be really cool to get to put those in and watch that.
[01:41:50.960 --> 01:41:53.720]   I was thinking I could pair these to my Apple TV, right?
[01:41:53.720 --> 01:41:55.320]   And I could have two sets.
[01:41:55.320 --> 01:42:00.040]   So my wife and I could both be wearing headphones while we're watching TV, which is something
[01:42:00.040 --> 01:42:03.480]   that's not really, no spatial audio on Apple TV yet.
[01:42:03.480 --> 01:42:06.680]   But I think that's, oh, really, you only get spatial audio.
[01:42:06.680 --> 01:42:07.680]   It's only on iOS device.
[01:42:07.680 --> 01:42:08.880]   That's the frustrating.
[01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:10.960]   It does the app most, but not so where people get confused.
[01:42:10.960 --> 01:42:15.960]   It does the app most, but it doesn't do the relativistic thing because the TV never moves.
[01:42:15.960 --> 01:42:20.320]   So if you just move around, you don't expect that we're the source of the audio to be moving.
[01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:24.520]   But if you're watching on your iPad and you move it, it still wants to come from the same
[01:42:24.520 --> 01:42:27.680]   position for you.
[01:42:27.680 --> 01:42:29.200]   You're not convincing me yet, boys.
[01:42:29.200 --> 01:42:32.360]   And it's, and it's easy to explain to consumers.
[01:42:32.360 --> 01:42:33.360]   Exactly.
[01:42:33.360 --> 01:42:34.640]   I didn't even know that.
[01:42:34.640 --> 01:42:36.800]   You know how you wish your TV moved?
[01:42:36.800 --> 01:42:37.800]   Check it out.
[01:42:37.800 --> 01:42:38.800]   500 bucks.
[01:42:38.800 --> 01:42:39.800]   How many you want?
[01:42:39.800 --> 01:42:41.600]   How many you want to be honest?
[01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:42.600]   You're free?
[01:42:42.600 --> 01:42:48.240]   Plus you'll be happy to know we're not ruining the environment by giving you a free cable
[01:42:48.240 --> 01:42:49.240]   or free charger.
[01:42:49.240 --> 01:42:51.680]   This is extremely, extremely rare Earth.
[01:42:51.680 --> 01:42:54.880]   We recommend that you get one for your desk, one for your house, one for each of your
[01:42:54.880 --> 01:42:57.360]   watts, your yachts, including the wax yacht.
[01:42:57.360 --> 01:43:00.040]   Because you're going to want to have the separately, they'll charge separately.
[01:43:00.040 --> 01:43:01.040]   We have a separate charge.
[01:43:01.040 --> 01:43:02.040]   That's right.
[01:43:02.040 --> 01:43:07.320]   And then we have a charge adapter that will generate the feeling of power in a room that's
[01:43:07.320 --> 01:43:09.720]   $35 for the for the dongle adapter.
[01:43:09.720 --> 01:43:11.120]   I just want to point out.
[01:43:11.120 --> 01:43:12.520]   I could get 15.
[01:43:12.520 --> 01:43:18.880]   No, I'm sorry, 10 neodymium magnets for 15 bucks on Amazon.
[01:43:18.880 --> 01:43:20.920]   So you got to be careful.
[01:43:20.920 --> 01:43:21.920]   Be careful.
[01:43:21.920 --> 01:43:22.920]   Be careful.
[01:43:22.920 --> 01:43:23.920]   They use those.
[01:43:23.920 --> 01:43:24.920]   Do not swallow those.
[01:43:24.920 --> 01:43:25.920]   I know.
[01:43:25.920 --> 01:43:26.920]   Do not swallow them.
[01:43:26.920 --> 01:43:29.320]   And here that is terrifying.
[01:43:29.320 --> 01:43:36.080]   Well, it's been quite a year.
[01:43:36.080 --> 01:43:37.080]   Yes it has.
[01:43:37.080 --> 01:43:41.080]   And I hope you have enjoyed our best stuff 2020.
[01:43:41.080 --> 01:43:45.360]   Thanks to our producers, Carson Bondi and Micah Sargent.
[01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:46.360]   Thanks to our editors.
[01:43:46.360 --> 01:43:48.520]   And there've been too many to mention.
[01:43:48.520 --> 01:43:50.560]   Mostly I just can't remember their names.
[01:43:50.560 --> 01:43:56.880]   But thank you to Kevin and John and Anthony and the whole team here have put together
[01:43:56.880 --> 01:44:02.560]   this show all year long and are working hard out of their homes.
[01:44:02.560 --> 01:44:06.200]   Hey, it's going to be a good 2021, I think.
[01:44:06.200 --> 01:44:07.840]   Things are starting to look up a little bit.
[01:44:07.840 --> 01:44:09.240]   I hope you stay safe.
[01:44:09.240 --> 01:44:12.000]   I hope you have a wonderful holiday season.
[01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:17.520]   We'll be back next week with our last Mac break weekly of 2020.
[01:44:17.520 --> 01:44:22.520]   Maybe a look ahead to some of the Apple stuff we can expect in 2021.
[01:44:22.520 --> 01:44:23.520]   I'm Leo Laport.
[01:44:23.520 --> 01:44:25.600]   Thank you so much for watching.
[01:44:25.600 --> 01:44:26.960]   Happy holidays.
[01:44:26.960 --> 01:44:28.480]   We'll see you next week.
[01:44:28.480 --> 01:44:31.760]   Now I have to say it every time break time is over.
[01:44:31.760 --> 01:44:33.520]   So it's time to get back to work.
[01:44:33.520 --> 01:44:34.680]   No, I said it wrong.
[01:44:34.680 --> 01:44:44.880]   I never will get that right.
[01:44:44.880 --> 01:44:49.480]   I was looking for the rat hole music and I think it is somewhere.
[01:44:49.480 --> 01:44:51.280]   It is somewhere.
[01:44:51.280 --> 01:44:58.400]   Oh, this is the short one.
[01:44:58.400 --> 01:45:00.120]   I want the long one.
[01:45:00.120 --> 01:45:03.880]   Are you pre-up the rattle?
[01:45:03.880 --> 01:45:04.880]   There's a really long rattle.
[01:45:04.880 --> 01:45:05.880]   Oh, he could play it again.
[01:45:05.880 --> 01:45:06.880]   He could play it.
[01:45:06.880 --> 01:45:09.920]   I like to estimate.
[01:45:09.920 --> 01:45:17.560]   Then there's a long one that goes on.
[01:45:17.560 --> 01:45:24.520]   It's open in the rat hole.
[01:45:24.520 --> 01:45:34.560]   You know he's open in the rat hole.
[01:45:34.560 --> 01:45:37.920]   Let's say we got that.
[01:45:37.920 --> 01:45:38.920]   We got it.
