[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Bandwidth for Mac Break Weekly is provided by cashfly@cachefly.com.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   This is Mac Break Weekly, episode 1 for August 9th, 2006.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   WWDC Aftermath.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   This week on Mac Break Weekly, David Pogue of the New York Times,
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   Command N's Amber MacArthur from Macworld Magazine, Chris Breen from the Pixel Core, Alex Lindsey.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   And I'm your host, Leo LaPort.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   Here we are sitting around a table, well not really a virtual table, the Skype Round Table,
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   to talk a little bit about Macintosh.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   Let me introduce everybody and then Alex I want you to explain why Mac Break Weekly.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   So let's start off with Amber McIntosh, who is of course perfectly named for this show.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   Amber MacArthur, hey Amber.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   Hey Leo, how are you doing?
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   She's calling from Toronto and she's of course my co-host on Call for Help and the host of
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   Torrent on G4TechTV Canada and hosts her own podcast, Command N, the video podcast with
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   Mike Lazazra out of Toronto and many other things.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   Chris Breen is also here.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   I am the Mac Daddy from Macworld Magazine, does the Mac 911 column, wrote the best-selling
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   book on iPods, what is it called iPods Secrets?
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   Secrets to the iPod and also there's the iPod and iTunes Pocket Guide.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   Yes, which I keep actually having my pocket.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   Really?
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   Right now.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   It'll stop a bullet too.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   So put it in your breast pocket.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   I've been sitting on you all day actually.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   David Pogue, I'm so glad to have you.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.200]   Of course, is a Mac guy going way back the great New York Times columnist and reviewer.
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.360]   You have to review Windows products I know in your column in the New York Times, but I
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.000]   know where your heart lies, David.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   Don't tell anyone.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.120]   I know it's buried.
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:04.200]   And actually I just downloaded or actually bought a copy of Dragon Naturally Speaking because
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.640]   of your rave review of it.
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.520]   But more to the point because you said you could run it in parallels on a McIntosh.
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.520]   Indeed.
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.520]   I wasn't willing to do it on a Windows machine.
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.240]   But now that I know I can do it on the Mac, I'm happy.
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.000]   And of course, Alex Lindsey, who is along with Amber, one of the co-hosts of Mac Break,
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   The Video Show.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.240]   Really, the reason we thought we'd start this week is because of WWDC.
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.240]   Chris, I think you might have been the only person actually at the keynote.
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.240]   Were you there?
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.240]   Yeah, I was there.
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.440]   I was in sort of the off to the side press seats.
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.960]   So I wasn't close enough for Steve to sweat on me, but still I got the general tenor of
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:41.960]   the thing.
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.360]   Was Steve sweating or was he his usual relaxed self?
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.560]   He was pretty relaxed.
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:51.480]   And also, unlike a lot of past keynotes, he shared the stage with a lot of the Apple
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.480]   guys.
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.080]   Normally, people expect Steve to hold down the stage and then they bring in the special
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.080]   guest from Intel or the Microsoft Business unit or something.
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.520]   This time, Steve had a lot of Apple filled, made an appearance and forced over.
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.680]   Filts and making appearances a lot lately.
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:14.280]   Yeah, well, he's sort of the hardy to Steve's laurel or the other way around.
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.280]   I'm not sure what it.
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.400]   But when they team up, they do bits and Phil's always good for a bit.
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.600]   No one ever talks about Phil Schiller.
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.600]   You know, everyone talks about the cult of Steve and the personality of Steve, but Phil
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.120]   Schiller is a really cool guy.
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.840]   You know, like if you interview him, he'll give you honest answers and he'll acknowledge
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.120]   flaws and you know, he's a really cool guy.
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.080]   What's his title?
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:44.120]   He's the director of worldwide marketing or possibly the worldwide director of marketing.
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.720]   But he's a marketing guy, isn't he, David?
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.360]   Well, he is a marketing guy and that's what's so shocking about the fact that he'll be
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.360]   straight with you.
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.680]   I mean, you know, he colors everything a little bit, but in general, he'll be straight with
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:56.680]   you.
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:57.680]   So did you watch Amber?
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.880]   Did you watch the keynote on the video?
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.800]   Yeah, I've seen some of the video clips on the web and I've been reading up on leopard
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.720]   and I'm pretty excited about leopard.
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.680]   I know some people are saying, well, there's not that many new features, but I'm excited
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.320]   about spaces, some of the new features in iChat as well because I've been using iChat
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.120]   a lot more, especially with you, Leo.
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.120]   We like iChat.
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.000]   Our new Mac books, it finally makes sense not to carry around our iSight cameras.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.080]   So it seems like there's some great features just in leopard and some of the stuff that
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.040]   has come out of cleaning time machine and a few other things as well.
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.800]   So there were two announcements, two big announcements.
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:30.960]   Leopard wasn't a surprise announcement.
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.400]   We knew he'd talk about that and of course, then the new hardware.
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.680]   Let's deal with leopard first, since you brought it up, Amber.
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:39.680]   Any surprises?
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.840]   I wasn't surprised about anything that came up in leopard.
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:47.440]   I don't think there was anything that was kind of, oh, wow, this is so amazing and revolutionary.
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.920]   To me, it's more just like some basic improvements on the operating system and some things that
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.200]   are kind of neat and sort of the cool factor, really.
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.200]   Yeah.
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.200]   How about you, David?
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.840]   I mean, you're the one who has to write the missing manual for this sucker.
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.280]   Yeah, no, I'm going to have to disagree.
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:07.640]   I think with each release, they try to come up with one blockbuster feature that you just
[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.920]   have to get, like, spotlight.
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.440]   Something that will change your entire existence with the computer.
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.840]   So before you say what you think that feature is, I'd like everybody to guess.
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:18.840]   Yeah, I know.
[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:19.840]   I'm really curious.
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.560]   I'm going to guess the virtual desktops.
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.640]   I'm guessing Chris.
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:25.920]   I'm guessing time machine.
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:26.920]   Time machine.
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.080]   The time machine's going to be OK.
[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.080]   I'm guessing.
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.080]   Hold on.
[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.080]   I'm Alex says time machine.
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.480]   Amber, do you want to make a guess?
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:37.120]   Yeah, I would have to say the virtual desktop, just because I think that's probably the most
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.120]   interesting.
[00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.800]   I want to point out both of these features have been available.
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:46.040]   Well, time machine is actually a Windows thing and go back, spend around for a long
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.040]   time.
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.640]   And virtual desktops have been available on every platform, including the guitar.
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:53.440]   No, but dudes, you can't go doing that.
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.040]   That happens every time with every feature.
[00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:00.200]   There is nothing new under the sun and every time the couple of dust and cool.
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.120]   They'll say, yeah, but confabulate it.
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.520]   Yeah, but in Linux, they had this.
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:11.920]   It doesn't count if it's a third party share where, know about it and install it and troubleshoot
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:12.920]   it think.
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:17.160]   So what do you think is the one feature that it blows you away?
[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.960]   I think it's time machine.
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:19.960]   Time machine.
[00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:25.240]   Four percent of us right now have an automated invisible up to date at this second backup
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.240]   system.
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.240]   Do you know Leo?
[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.240]   I do.
[00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.040]   OK, so you're one of the four percent.
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.800]   Which means none of you do.
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.200]   My backup is every Sunday.
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.680]   I drag my home folder onto an external drive.
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.800]   I spend a lot of money to have a network attached storage device that does this automatically.
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.200]   I use super duper in the background.
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.520]   Of course, super duper.
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:49.800]   A third party share where, you know, I have to say though, a number of people made this
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:55.280]   point that once again, I think Dan Carilla made it more kind of feistily than anybody
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:59.840]   else, once again, Apple has rated the shareware community and kind of taken some of the best
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.400]   ideas for its own.
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:05.200]   And Dan, of course, guided Sherlock or Watson, which became Sherlock.
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:09.960]   And then he did a web application just before iWeb came out.
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:11.480]   He didn't do anything this time.
[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:17.200]   So to me, I think Apple might be slapping the shareware community around a little bit.
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:21.960]   Yeah, but here again, that's what everybody says, but Microsoft does it and Microsoft
[00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:26.280]   steals from Apple and everybody's upset and Apple steals from Microsoft and then Linux
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:27.280]   steals from Microsoft.
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:30.120]   I mean, look, they're just these ideas.
[00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.840]   It's about the implementation.
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:32.840]   That's true.
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:38.560]   It's about building it in and saving thousands and thousands of people from losing everything
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.040]   when their hard drive dies or when somebody deletes the wrong thing.
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:47.360]   I mean, all of these people are now going to be covered automatically and without thinking.
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:48.800]   That is an enormous change.
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.640]   Tell us what time machine does.
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:55.720]   Well, it's an automatic invisible backup system and it has something in common with system
[00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:59.880]   and restore on Windows, which is that if something goes wrong with your Mac, you can
[00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:06.240]   rewind it to when it was working well, or an individual document or an individual window
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:07.240]   in the Finder.
[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:14.280]   And it's a really cool, like, time travel visual interface where you rewind to a certain date
[00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:19.960]   and that document is now in the condition it was on June 3rd, or that window where you
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:25.040]   could have sworn you filed the precious flank steak recipe is now restored with that document
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:26.040]   again.
[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:31.520]   So, this is kind of more like go back than system restore, because go back to data too.
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.040]   System restore does not do data.
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:34.040]   Exactly.
[00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:35.520]   Well, that's pretty cool.
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:38.000]   If it doesn't eat up a lot of resources, slow the machine down.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.160]   If it really works.
[00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:42.920]   Well, it needs an external hard drive, but you know what?
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:44.600]   People should have a second hard drive.
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:45.600]   That's true.
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:46.600]   So, that's how it works.
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.720]   It automatically does it to an external hard drive.
[00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.680]   Sorry, not external, just a second one.
[00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:51.680]   Second, okay.
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:56.800]   Yeah, so it doesn't do it to a partition and, you know, so the difficulty there I think
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:00.840]   is I'm thinking of my mother as fondly.
[00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:05.920]   And I mean, is my mother going to go out and buy an external hard drive?
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:08.120]   Well, I'll buy one for her and tell her how to do this.
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:09.600]   But I do think that she should.
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.120]   Well, no, she should.
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.120]   Absolutely right.
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:14.280]   You know who it bothers me is what about laptop users?
[00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:15.840]   We don't have second hard drives left.
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:16.840]   Right.
[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:17.840]   Yeah.
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:20.560]   So, that means all of us are going to be going out and buying firewire drives or for our
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.280]   mothers who say here, you need this.
[00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:24.360]   Don't, I don't want to have to tell you why.
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.840]   Just I'm going to plug it in and.
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:27.600]   But I don't worry about it.
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:30.240]   I think that's actually one of the things that's important though, is the fact that
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:31.240]   you can plug it in.
[00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:35.800]   I mean, this is part of what when Apple does something, you could plug it in for your parents
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:37.680]   and you could tell them don't worry about it again.
[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.200]   And it just kind of runs in the background.
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.200]   Does the thing I like to do?
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:41.200]   Yeah, I like that.
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:44.520]   Because I did kind of that for my mom, but I never really was able to get it, you know,
[00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:46.280]   to be as automatic as I'd like it to be.
[00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:47.600]   So, yeah, all right.
[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:48.600]   That makes sense.
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:52.480]   I mean, the two things that I'm most concerned about, I mean, I'm really excited about it.
[00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:55.200]   But I think that the number one is we work with large files.
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:59.360]   I mean, as you know, with Mac break and other things that, you know, we deal with single
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:03.160]   files that are 200 gigabytes at a time.
[00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:09.080]   And so, and even if you're not working with files that big, if I shoot all raw, for instance,
[00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:12.440]   and I probably shoot a gigabyte or two gigabytes every couple days.
[00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:15.480]   Yeah, man, you're going to have a big extra hard drive.
[00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.640]   Well, that's what I'm, you know, how do I deal with that?
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:21.960]   And maybe how do I, I haven't seen so far with Time Machine is how we can distinguish
[00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:25.320]   folders and say these folders aren't going to be counted or they're only going to be
[00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:27.360]   done every so often or whatever.
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:29.640]   The second thing is, of course, the security.
[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:34.120]   If I want to delete something and make sure that it's really gone, what kind of controls
[00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:36.120]   am I going to have to make that happen?
[00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:40.280]   Now, yeah, you mentioned virtual desktops, which I like a lot.
[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:43.160]   I mean, to me, it's an easy, easy way to work.
[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:46.640]   Do you use virtual desktops on Windows or on Linux or anywhere else?
[00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:49.240]   You know, I don't use Windows too much anymore at all.
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:51.080]   I want to be quite honest.
[00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:54.840]   And I've used it before and I think that it'll be a great thing to have on my Mac because
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:59.320]   I'm really, I'm using the laptop a lot and I think anything that really helps me manage
[00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:02.920]   my time between different applications will be great and the idea that I can go from one
[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:05.360]   app to another and just kind of drag and drop.
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:07.160]   That's one thing that I'm definitely excited about.
[00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:10.320]   And, you know, funny enough and I'm embarrassed to say the other thing that I was most excited
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:12.160]   about was the new voice, Alex.
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:15.560]   Yeah, they finally got rid of bubbles and Victorian.
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:17.560]   Those lame voices.
[00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:18.560]   I know, it's silly.
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:23.160]   And that was just one of the things that I've read up about a lot that people keep mentioning.
[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:27.800]   So those are the type of little features I think that will kind of make a difference
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:29.640]   and impact this, the average user.
[00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:31.200]   I'll use spaces a lot.
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.200]   That's the virtual desktop.
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:36.640]   I just, I use it on Linux and it's really a great way to, unless you have a 30, of course,
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:40.280]   you guys probably have a 30 inch screens, but for me, it's a really nice way to get
[00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:41.280]   more real estate.
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:44.520]   I actually have one of the 30 inch screen laptops.
[00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:46.520]   It's a screen to carry around.
[00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:48.520]   You're so lucky, David.
[00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:54.720]   Now, they dropped the price on the 30 inch to 1999, still a lot of my range, but I guess
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:58.280]   if you wanted a lot of space, that's a good deal.
[00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:03.320]   Okay, now maybe more to the point, I mean, I think I agree with you, David, that time
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:05.640]   machine is going to be important for end users.
[00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:09.640]   I think something that was going to make a big difference is core animation.
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:13.120]   Alex, you probably know a little more about this than others since you deal with these
[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:15.000]   kinds of technologies all the time.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.160]   What do you think about that?
[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:20.400]   It's going to be really exciting and I have to admit that I don't know enough about it
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:22.720]   yet other than what they really showed there.
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:28.160]   But the main thing is that if you look at what's happened with core audio or core video,
[00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:31.280]   what you're seeing is Apple, you know, putting something into the operating system where
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:34.240]   a developer doesn't have to do all the work.
[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:37.000]   I mean, a lot of this, I've got to get, you know, instead of having to write something
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.280]   that builds all the interfaces with a camera or works with a lot of the elements that you
[00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:46.200]   would normally do with video, core video does that all for you, you can simply say, "Go
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:49.680]   get that for me and bring it over and then I can use that as an object."
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:52.600]   In the same way, you know, Apple's doing a lot of this for animation.
[00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:57.320]   So what we're able to do from what I understand, from what I've seen so far is that, you know,
[00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:02.920]   as a developer, you're going to be able to do a lot of fun animation type pieces within
[00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:08.280]   your applications and you're going to be able to cut the amount of code writing that you
[00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:13.040]   have to do, you can just tell, I want a keyframe from here to here, rather than building all
[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:17.720]   the entire class that would be required to do that on your own.
[00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:20.040]   That's my understanding of what I've seen.
[00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:25.040]   What it means for us as users is that we're going to see apps that do a lot of really
[00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:30.520]   cool things and very useful things in the not too distant future when people start accessing
[00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:35.000]   these because it not only means that it's less code to write, but it's easier for a
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.840]   programmer that doesn't know as much about animation to start adding those features to
[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:39.840]   their software.
[00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:42.280]   Yeah, but how much of that have you seen in Core Video?
[00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:45.200]   I mean, that was a big thing they did last year and they had fill up there and you're
[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:48.480]   saying, "Oh, look at this picture of a tiger, I'm going to take it, I'm going to twist
[00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:49.840]   it and turn it in."
[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:53.160]   I haven't seen any tools like that for kind of the common Joe.
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:58.680]   So Core Audio is well represented in GarageBand, but where are we seeing Core Video on sort
[00:13:58.680 --> 00:13:59.680]   of a user level?
[00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:02.080]   I have to say I agree a little bit because, for instance, the Core It's Composer, which
[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:07.400]   is an amazing thing, is underutilized by developers even.
[00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:11.400]   Well, I do think people are taking some time to get some of that stuff up.
[00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:18.160]   I know we've done some early development in both Core Audio and Core Video and especially
[00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:23.480]   with Core Audio, what I was amazed at, we were working on actually and we're in process
[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:28.400]   on something that would allow you, for instance, to record a whole lot of audio tracks at one
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:31.800]   time for something like a podcast, for instance.
[00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:36.080]   And the fact that we didn't have to write all that stuff, we didn't have to write all
[00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:38.800]   the filters, we didn't have to write a lot of the pieces that we would normally have
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:39.800]   to write.
[00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:44.480]   It was literally turn all the stuff on in Core Audio and make it go, allowed us to be
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:48.280]   working with something that we could start testing within literally a couple of days
[00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:49.680]   after we started talking about it.
[00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:55.960]   Hey, conspiracy theory time, but this Core Core Core came before the Intel move.
[00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:58.040]   Do you think they knew?
[00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:00.960]   Or is it just a coincidence?
[00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:03.440]   Because the Core chip, right?
[00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:06.880]   Well I don't think that the Core, I mean I think that the Core Audio and Core Video
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:07.880]   and Core animation is...
[00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:10.240]   What did that happen to Tiger or pre-Tiger?
[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:13.040]   Anyway, it happened pre-Intel anyway, who knows?
[00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:14.040]   Yeah.
[00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:15.040]   I don't know.
[00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:16.040]   But these are really...
[00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:17.040]   I mean these are really...
[00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:18.040]   I think this is all built into the OS, I think that's important.
[00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:19.040]   Yeah.
[00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:24.560]   What other features of the Leopard, the new spotted version of OS 10?
[00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:26.800]   There's some new stuff in the mail, yeah.
[00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:29.960]   RSS integration, is that what we're seeing?
[00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:32.280]   Yeah, there's a lot of cool stuff here and there.
[00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:35.360]   I think another big one is the iChat changes.
[00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:39.800]   I mean this is the kind of thing where they make these changes that are...
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:44.040]   They just make a change and leave you to sort out the possibilities.
[00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:50.960]   Like this thing about the green screen, they can turn you, you can put any photo or movie
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:53.320]   behind you when you're doing a video chat.
[00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:54.320]   Pretty cool.
[00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.160]   I don't know how they do that.
[00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:01.200]   Something to do with separating you from your background via proximity or something like
[00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:03.120]   the part of you that's in focus?
[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:04.920]   I can actually...
[00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:08.040]   If you don't mind, what they're doing is what's called a difference mat.
[00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:11.840]   So what they're looking for is that they take the background and they are...
[00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:12.840]   If you step...
[00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:14.560]   The reason they have you step out of it is it takes an image.
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:15.560]   Oh, but no.
[00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:16.560]   So that's how it works.
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:20.040]   So you start without you and then you go in and it knows what the difference is.
[00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:22.800]   Yeah, if you notice on the keynote, he steps out and steps back in.
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:26.920]   And then what I was going to say, which pixels have changed between what it's before and
[00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:27.920]   after.
[00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:30.440]   And it's a very old computer graphics trick.
[00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:33.840]   But there, it's great that it's done in such an easy way to...
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:36.280]   So now, Amber, when you and I chat, you won't know that I'm in my...
[00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:40.040]   Oh, no, you will know I'm in my jammies, but you'll think I'm actually in the Taj Mahal
[00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:41.040]   in my jammies.
[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:44.240]   So we have to work a way to change the jammie part.
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:48.760]   Well, the key is taking a photo of your bedroom so that you can go on vacation and tell your
[00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:49.760]   boss that you're sick and...
[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:50.760]   I'm in...
[00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:51.760]   I'm sick.
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:52.760]   That's a good idea.
[00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:55.920]   But also the screen sharing stuff is really cool.
[00:16:55.920 --> 00:17:00.840]   So you can demonstrate to somebody on the other end, you know, a document, a movie or
[00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:03.040]   what you're working on on your Mac.
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:04.600]   They can see what you're doing.
[00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:05.600]   Does anybody use...
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:09.560]   I mean, I'm just thinking back again to the four-way video conferencing that they introduced
[00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:10.560]   in Tiger.
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:11.560]   Does anybody use that?
[00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:12.560]   Or...
[00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:15.480]   I mean, every time I've tried it, it takes so much bandwidth you can't do it.
[00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:20.200]   Sometimes I think they put in these features and they're not really practicable.
[00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:24.760]   I've used it in a couple of locations where we've had where we were doing intranet stuff,
[00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:27.080]   not the internet stuff.
[00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:30.920]   It's really hard to get enough bandwidth to make the four-way work.
[00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:35.040]   But David, I actually have a question for you about the controlling the screen because
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:37.600]   that's the part I didn't see as much of.
[00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:41.720]   Are you playing a movie on their side and then giving them feedback or is it trying to
[00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:42.720]   stream the movie over?
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:43.720]   Did you...
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:46.880]   I can play a movie and you get to watch it.
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:47.880]   Okay.
[00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:48.880]   Let's see.
[00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:49.880]   So what else?
[00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:53.040]   Just task lists to-do lists.
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:59.120]   I may end up using that more than any of these other fancy-danned features, right?
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:01.000]   Sometimes you don't know what you're going to use.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.960]   Well, go back to iChat for a second because one thing they didn't talk about that is going
[00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:09.520]   to be possible in here is you're going to be able to control another person's desktop.
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:11.520]   The two of you can collaborate over a desktop.
[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:16.920]   So you've got remote desktop built into iChat now, which could be incredibly helpful if
[00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:20.520]   you're troubleshooting somebody else's Mac who isn't quite sure what they're doing again
[00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:22.320]   back to mom.
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:27.120]   She and I can set up a chat and she says, "Oh, I've lost this because she shoved it in
[00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:28.320]   the wrong folder.
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:29.600]   I can then control her desktop."
[00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:30.600]   I say, "Oh, here it is.
[00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:31.600]   See, no, don't...
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:32.600]   That's Uncle Bud's pictures.
[00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:33.600]   Don't put it in there.
[00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:34.600]   These are your pictures.
[00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:35.600]   Put them over here."
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:39.440]   And I use Apple Remote Desktop almost daily.
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:41.360]   And it's just such a useful...
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:44.400]   I mean, it's hard to imagine at this point without having it.
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:48.960]   So having it be able to at least be available one to one, I think is very, very useful.
[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:51.880]   Yeah, in such a friendly way as well.
[00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:52.880]   Yeah.
[00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:57.200]   Mom and I are accustomed to chatting to each other visually, but remote desktop would be
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:58.200]   sort of...
[00:18:58.200 --> 00:18:59.200]   What do you...
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:01.000]   Yeah, that's a really good idea.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.920]   That's a really good idea.
[00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:04.120]   Do you guys think that...
[00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:11.280]   What do you think of this whole Apple Microsoft leopard vista comparison thing that is?
[00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:12.680]   Why are they doing that?
[00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:13.680]   Why do they bother?
[00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:15.680]   It strikes me as so irrelevant.
[00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:16.680]   It makes you look...
[00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:19.040]   Frankly, it makes you look like a weenie.
[00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:20.040]   It does.
[00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:22.160]   It's like, "Oh, we're bad, isn't he?"
[00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:25.200]   And it makes frankly makes the me think they're weak.
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:27.440]   But it also makes no sense to me.
[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:29.080]   Like, two things about it.
[00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:33.240]   Number one is they say, "Oh, Apple has done five versions of macOS 10."
[00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:37.040]   And then time it took Microsoft to do one version of Windows.
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:39.280]   But like, is that necessarily a good thing?
[00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:41.040]   That's $650.
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:45.920]   $80 for five years just to keep current.
[00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:49.560]   And secondly, let's get over it.
[00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:51.560]   Windows is corporate America.
[00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:52.760]   That is the market share.
[00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:53.760]   That's the 90%.
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:56.800]   These guys buy 500 or 1000 copies at a time.
[00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:00.320]   It doesn't matter how much better the Mac is or Linux.
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:06.440]   It will never change and it makes absolutely no difference to these guys who buy the bulk
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:08.680]   copies and make up the market share.
[00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:14.720]   So for everybody to have this fantasy that it's somehow a race or an even pitted pair
[00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:18.120]   of warriors, it's ridiculous.
[00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:19.120]   Yeah.
[00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:22.040]   Well, it's not even close, really, in reality.
[00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:25.080]   Although Apple's gaining market share.
[00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:27.960]   But they're gaining market share in the cracks.
[00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:33.760]   That's individuals and small businesses, these tiny, penny-antie, one or two copy people
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:36.360]   who can make their own purchasing decisions.
[00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:41.440]   But the corporations do not when you are hired by Smith Barney, you sit down at a desk, they
[00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:43.720]   give you and it's already administered.
[00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:46.000]   So you don't get to choose.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.800]   So that's what I'm saying is that the market share thing, it can never sway more than a
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:56.200]   few tiny percent the scraps of those small numbers of people who can make their own choices.
[00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:57.200]   Should we care?
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:02.840]   I mean, do we really care whether Apple is a 3% or a 10% or a 20% of the market?
[00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:03.840]   I don't think so.
[00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:07.960]   I think the philosophies between Microsoft and Apple are very different.
[00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:11.560]   What they do, these operating systems are very different.
[00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:14.320]   And both companies are thriving and profitable.
[00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:15.840]   And they're each serving their own niche.
[00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:20.400]   I mean, I think most of us can agree that Apple does the most innovation in operating
[00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:21.400]   systems.
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:26.520]   Microsoft then sees what they like of that and implements it in the next version.
[00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:27.520]   But so what?
[00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:29.080]   Apple also steals from Microsoft.
[00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:31.440]   Anyway, my point is they both have a niche.
[00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:35.800]   They both have strengths and a following.
[00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:40.200]   And it's just not the race that we really care about.
[00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:44.960]   Well, how much of that do you think is Steve Jobs throwing meat to the audience?
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:47.520]   The people in the room who go, "Yeah, you're right, Steve."
[00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:51.640]   Because it doesn't seem to translate too much to the mainstream press.
[00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:56.360]   They pick it up a little bit, but generally they tend to focus on whatever the features
[00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:58.800]   are of the new products and put that stuff aside.
[00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:00.400]   You know, Chris is funny.
[00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:04.640]   You should mention that because once a year I get to interview Steve Jobs at the Mackerel
[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:05.880]   Expo.
[00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:11.800]   And I had just written a blog entry about how many features of Windows Vista, which had
[00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:18.000]   been announced the day before at CES, were from Mac OS X.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:23.040]   And so I started, I was halfway through a sentence about asking him his feelings on
[00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:24.040]   that.
[00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:33.640]   And he went into Steve Jobs tirade at me saying, "What's the matter with you effing media people
[00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:35.780]   that you don't hold their feet to the fire?
[00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:37.600]   You let them get away with murder.
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:40.880]   You let them get off Scott People."
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:44.280]   And I'm like, "Dude, I'm the one who just wrote about it."
[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:52.360]   And he goes, "In your blog, how do you read about the blog?"
[00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:57.120]   Well I think really that reflects maybe why this marketing campaign is that Steve is feeling,
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:02.120]   he's got a little chip on his shoulder, he's feeling a little second best to Windows, to
[00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:03.120]   Microsoft.
[00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:04.120]   I don't think he should.
[00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:08.880]   I can tell you he's super pissed at them, that he's super pissed about how many of these
[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:11.360]   good Apple ideas made their way into Vista.
[00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:12.920]   And you know, I don't blame him.
[00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:15.600]   Well, but as you pointed out, you can't be pissed about that.
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:18.720]   Look at their borrowing system restore now.
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:23.240]   I mean, cross-pollination is good for end users, right?
[00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:25.040]   So we're all happy.
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:27.400]   Photo booth, which was not much heralded when it came out.
[00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:34.480]   In fact, I think it came out in between operating system releases on the iMac with the camera.
[00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:35.480]   My kids love it.
[00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:36.640]   It's one of the coolest applications.
[00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:40.120]   It's a really fun way to show core video off.
[00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:45.280]   And sometimes, you know, it may be iChat that blows everybody away.
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:48.880]   Because it's an unexpected thing that people get excited about.
[00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:51.080]   Oh man, photo booth is just so awesome.
[00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:55.880]   Yeah, it's like my kids, when they have play dates, they gather around this thing for
[00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:56.880]   hours.
[00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:00.920]   I think we have over 12,000 saved snapshots.
[00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:04.880]   And then their parents come and pick them up and go, "What is that?"
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:08.840]   And then they sit there and make themselves look sad and skinny.
[00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:11.200]   It's kind of the stealth application on that.
[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:15.640]   I don't know why my Apple doesn't promote it a little bit more because it's frankly
[00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:18.080]   maybe the coolest thing on a Macintosh.
[00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:19.080]   I hate to say that.
[00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:20.640]   Well, front row is the same thing.
[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:26.080]   I think front row, when you show people front row and compare it to Windows Media Center,
[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:28.720]   people go, "Well, that's pretty good.
[00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:29.720]   That's pretty nice."
[00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:30.720]   Wow.
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:32.920]   Yeah, and then they spend 20 minutes with it and go, "Oh, that's pretty limited."
[00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:33.920]   It doesn't do much.
[00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:34.920]   Yeah, it doesn't do much.
[00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:35.920]   It looks good, though.
[00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:39.960]   That is something I'd like to see in Leopard and the new hardware is maybe a TV tuner and
[00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:41.640]   recording capabilities.
[00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:44.400]   That's really all that's missing at this point, I think.
[00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:48.560]   Yeah, and to get the whole sharing media ideas wonderful.
[00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:49.560]   I love it.
[00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:50.560]   I can have them.
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:51.560]   But it doesn't work.
[00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:52.560]   Oh, it doesn't?
[00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:54.480]   No, it works poorly.
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:55.480]   What doesn't work?
[00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:56.880]   Does it not play back well?
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:00.120]   Well, what it needs is a really, really fat pipe to do it.
[00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:04.960]   So if you try to do it over AirPort, yes, maybe you can do it over a strong AirPort connection
[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:08.160]   and get something you purchase from the iTunes Music Store.
[00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:10.040]   But if you've got a full-length movie, forget it.
[00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:11.760]   I'm a Gigabit Ethernet fan now.
[00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:13.560]   Yeah, you have to be a Gigabit Ethernet.
[00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:14.560]   Yeah.
[00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:15.560]   And then you do it by alias.
[00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:19.160]   You know, alias it to your, to your, over the network around it.
[00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:20.160]   Do it through it.
[00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:21.160]   I love her.
[00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:23.360]   You can send her over your network.
[00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:24.360]   Wow.
[00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:25.360]   You're perfectly fine.
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:26.360]   Wow.
[00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:27.360]   Now I am.
[00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:28.360]   It's only legal in Canada, though.
[00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:29.360]   You have to come there.
[00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:32.440]   Yeah, because you guys pay a license fee for copying.
[00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:35.080]   All your blank media.
[00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:37.560]   We can't get any TV shows or anything here on iTunes.
[00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:39.760]   So that's definitely not true.
[00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:41.920]   That was, of course, some of the announcements were new TV shows.
[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:45.160]   So you, in Canada, you don't get any of those TV shows at all?
[00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:47.880]   No, we don't get any of those TV shows at all.
[00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:52.640]   There's really nothing as far as the iTunes Music Store and the store in general.
[00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:55.840]   There's no real video content that's worth buying.
[00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:59.320]   We just don't have any of the television shows and it's just not there yet.
[00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:00.560]   And that's a huge disappointment.
[00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:03.880]   Don't you get a break on Gordon Lightfoot recordings or something?
[00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:04.880]   And Murray.
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:05.880]   All the Ann Murray you can tell.
[00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:06.880]   Easy there.
[00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:11.360]   We have good Canadian music and I have to say there's great Canadian music.
[00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:15.520]   But Ann Murray is good too.
[00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:19.720]   So now do you think that this is really just the movie companies?
[00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:24.680]   Or sometimes I think maybe Apple isn't trying as hard as they might to get into these other
[00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:27.600]   markets that just kind of saying, well, we want to get in the US market.
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:33.000]   We'll worry about the other European and Canadian markets later.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.600]   Yeah, I think that's just part of it.
[00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:36.200]   I mean, it's a small market.
[00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:40.000]   We're a huge country, but if you think about it, it's just over 30 million people, right?
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.720]   So it's just a little bit delayed and then the laws are so different in different countries.
[00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:48.000]   And so they tend to tackle the US first and then we get stuff a little bit later.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.160]   But hopefully down the road that it will happen and we will get some TV shows.
[00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:53.200]   But I think it will be a while.
[00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:59.200]   Let's talk about the hardware because of course there is a new computer, the Mac Pro.
[00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:00.520]   Not really a surprise to anybody.
[00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:02.760]   It's using the Woodcrest chip.
[00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:03.760]   That's a little bit of a surprise.
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:10.240]   Because I was kind of hoping to see a Core 2 chip in this guy, not a Core, although the
[00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:13.920]   Woodcrest is a very powerful, it's really a Xeon.
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:16.640]   Any thoughts from anybody about the Mac Pro?
[00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:18.920]   Well, I'm pretty excited.
[00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:19.920]   It's an amazing order.
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:20.920]   I saw the...
[00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:22.560]   I'm going to order one soon.
[00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:24.040]   I've been able to hold off.
[00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:27.360]   You know, the only thing that attracts me, because I have a dual G5, the only thing that
[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:29.240]   attracts me is that it's quieter.
[00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:32.360]   I don't know if you can hear my G5 humming in the background, but it's a hot day and
[00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:33.360]   it's loud.
[00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:34.360]   Yeah.
[00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:39.720]   Well, what I noticed when I saw it open was really what you can do when you don't have
[00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:43.520]   an enormous amount of cooling elements for a handful of chips.
[00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:46.400]   Well, they've got four drive bays in there, right?
[00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:47.400]   Right.
[00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:48.560]   And the ability to put in...
[00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:49.560]   Put in...
[00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:52.600]   It's four PCI Express cards.
[00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:54.760]   There's four slots there.
[00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:55.760]   You have video cards.
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:57.280]   I'm not sure whether...
[00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:01.280]   One of the things that we're going to be testing soon is whether, at least on the window
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:07.880]   side on a Intel tower, whether we can do SLI, which is, of course, stacking.
[00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:10.680]   Of course, we're a little geeky on the graphics stuff.
[00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:13.840]   The highest card that they're selling is the quadro.
[00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:14.840]   The 4500.
[00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:15.840]   Yeah.
[00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:18.880]   Which is a very, very good card.
[00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:19.880]   Is it?
[00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:23.360]   Yeah, no, that's pretty much the high end of what...
[00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:30.520]   Not the high end, but very close to the high end of what Nvidia produces and a very, very
[00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:31.520]   powerful card.
[00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:32.520]   So...
[00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:34.520]   David, are you excited about any hardware?
[00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:36.800]   Oh, did you see anything?
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:38.600]   Yeah, that was kind of my reaction.
[00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:40.520]   I was hoping for more, maybe.
[00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:44.040]   You know, I was like trying to talk to my editor about whether I should review it for
[00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:47.120]   the times and like, what would I say?
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:48.600]   You know, it looks the same.
[00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:49.600]   It's faster.
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:50.600]   Yay.
[00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:53.480]   You know, is it fast enough to run Photoshop now?
[00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:56.640]   I mean, like, I know the other Intel Max are.
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:57.640]   Right.
[00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:02.560]   So, I've been announced by the way that they're going to do Office soon, right, for the Intel
[00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:03.840]   and Universal Office.
[00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:05.320]   They're rewriting the whole thing.
[00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:10.840]   Yeah, not saying when, but that is good news, although it's news we had back in January.
[00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:11.840]   Right.
[00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:12.840]   Oh, we knew this already?
[00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:13.840]   Yeah.
[00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:14.840]   Oh, okay.
[00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:17.280]   It's not like we're seeing a huge performance hit on this.
[00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:19.800]   I mean, it runs perfectly fine after it's done anyway.
[00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:20.800]   It's an office.
[00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:22.160]   Yeah, so how fast you need to do it.
[00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:24.600]   It's really photoshop is the thing that everybody needs.
[00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:25.600]   Yeah.
[00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:26.600]   Yeah.
[00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:30.480]   So, I've got a question for you since, of course, Leopard begins with Leo.
[00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:31.520]   Oh, it does.
[00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:32.840]   This is my operating system.
[00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:36.880]   I'm going to change my name from Leo Laporte to Leo Lapurd.
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:39.560]   No, that's not good.
[00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:44.360]   Dude, you should write a book and then, you know, that could be your slogan.
[00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:45.520]   Leopard begins with Leo.
[00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:47.320]   I mean, you've got, oh, you're right.
[00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:50.000]   You've got a bumper sticker waiting to happen.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.560]   And this is it, right, because next is going to be some other cat and I'll be out of luck.
[00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:55.560]   Do we know what the next cat is?
[00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:56.560]   Ocelot.
[00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:57.560]   No.
[00:29:57.560 --> 00:29:58.560]   No, I'm just kidding.
[00:29:58.560 --> 00:29:59.560]   It could be.
[00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:04.560]   But no, there's some Norwegian guy named us who's getting very excited right now.
[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:06.560]   So you've got to be careful.
[00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:07.560]   But I do.
[00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:08.560]   But I do.
[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:09.560]   It's a bit us.
[00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:13.200]   But I do have a question for you, Leo.
[00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:18.360]   Why don't you explain to the people about Leopard being 64-bit?
[00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:20.160]   Explain exactly what that means.
[00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:25.440]   Well, this is kind of a surprise to me because I always thought everything was 64-bit.
[00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:30.160]   You know, the PowerPC chips, the G5 and the G4, are 64-bit chips.
[00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:34.200]   In fact, I was a little shocked that they went to Intel chips, which were 32-bit.
[00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:36.160]   But now the Xeon is a full 64-bit chip.
[00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:38.320]   In fact, it's really used in servers.
[00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:42.240]   I mean, there's a Dell ProLiant server that uses this woodcrest chip.
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:44.400]   There's a SGI is going to use this.
[00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:45.520]   It's not a desktop chip.
[00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:47.520]   It's considered a server chip.
[00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:52.240]   64-bit is a mixed blessing for content creators, people like you, Alex, you might get a big
[00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:56.680]   benefit out of it because you operate on big chunks of data.
[00:30:56.680 --> 00:31:00.720]   But because your pointers are bigger, because you're operating in bigger chunks, a lot of
[00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:02.280]   operations are in fact not faster.
[00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:05.040]   It might even be slower.
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:10.560]   I've never been a big, you know, we got to go 64-bit kind of guy.
[00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:14.680]   And in our end, we all believe that we do have to go 64-bit only.
[00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:16.200]   Yeah, because of what you do.
[00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:18.760]   The big pipes and being able to address a lot more memory.
[00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:24.560]   I think that the towers are really, they really are moving towards being true workstations.
[00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:28.280]   I mean, there was a point, there was this kind of lag for Apple and a lot of other companies
[00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:34.600]   where the laptops and the towers were within a ballpark of each other except for being
[00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:36.240]   able to add cards.
[00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:41.800]   As you start to look at where these new Intel towers are going, you know, 16 gigs of RAM,
[00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:45.720]   being able to add multiple graphics cards, being able to add two terabytes of storage.
[00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:47.200]   That's your advantage, isn't it?
[00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:48.200]   Wow.
[00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:52.800]   The thing is, is that a lot of this will remain to be seen.
[00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:56.600]   I can say something because I haven't seen anything, which is that, you know, we're
[00:31:56.600 --> 00:32:01.240]   really looking forward to whenever Final Cut Pro Studio comes out and the curiosity, of
[00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:05.720]   course, will be how much will they take advantage of being able to have a ton of RAM, being
[00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:09.800]   able to have really, really big video cards built in.
[00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:15.720]   Because when you look at a program like Motion, which by all reports, you're going to see
[00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:17.440]   a lot more of the Motion functionality.
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:18.440]   That's where you get the value.
[00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:19.440]   Final Cut Pro.
[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:20.440]   Yeah, that's where you get the value.
[00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:24.960]   But, you know, a word processor, most of the stuff most people do, surfing, email, it
[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:26.520]   could even be slower, frankly.
[00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:30.600]   But, yeah, and truly at this point, you really could do all of that on a laptop.
[00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:32.200]   I mean, there's not really any good reason.
[00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:33.200]   I mean, these, these are really exciting.
[00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:37.080]   I don't think anybody should buy a pro who isn't, in fact, doing pro content creation
[00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:38.080]   at this point.
[00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:39.080]   I would agree.
[00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:42.120]   That's a, that's a basically a server.
[00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:44.360]   That's what surprised me, frankly.
[00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:51.800]   I would, you know, there's actually room now in the line for a mid-range desktop.
[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:55.680]   Maybe they don't do it, but that does the core too that is more of a desktop device
[00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:58.960]   and less of a, you know, kind of massive server device.
[00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:01.760]   But I think when you look at the Mini and the iMac, those are really, I mean, those
[00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:02.760]   are, yeah.
[00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:03.760]   Those are, yeah.
[00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:06.200]   Or full computers for what they, you know, for what they are.
[00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:11.240]   Anybody disappointed that you didn't see Conro and Merrim, the core two chips announced
[00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:13.560]   that, I mean, there's nothing there.
[00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:19.080]   That puts, actually puts Matt Apple kind of squarely behind the big PC box manufacturers
[00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:23.400]   who are all doing core two chips, boxes.
[00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:24.400]   I thought for a reason.
[00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:28.120]   Well, it just means that they can come up with the, you know, Mac Pro 2 in four months
[00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:29.120]   or whatever.
[00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:30.120]   Right.
[00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:31.120]   Right.
[00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:35.720]   So Amber, you missed it, but David gave a big yawn when we started talking about the
[00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:36.720]   hardware.
[00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:37.720]   I would agree with you.
[00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:41.760]   I would, that's actually, I had kind of a big yawn as well when I started to do the
[00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:42.760]   hardware.
[00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:44.480]   Definitely a little bit disappointing.
[00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:46.680]   I mean, I mean, the speed is welcome.
[00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:47.680]   I mean, that is great.
[00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:49.800]   That is, that is the big deal, right?
[00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:50.800]   It's a lot faster.
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:51.800]   I guess, I guess.
[00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:53.160]   Particularly for people like Alex.
[00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:55.960]   For me, it was really more the extensibility.
[00:33:55.960 --> 00:34:00.200]   I mean, the limit, there's been a lot of limitations to being able to, how much RAM we can put
[00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:05.360]   in them, how much, how many cards, you know, those are things that for us is really important.
[00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:09.040]   And stuff that, to be honest with you, the, you know, the G5, just, there wasn't enough
[00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:12.720]   there, you know, and, and you wanted to almost do custom PC versions.
[00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:13.720]   PC.
[00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:15.280]   Even the quad, huh?
[00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:17.960]   The quad, you know, and I have, you know, I work on a quad all day.
[00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:23.400]   And there's, there was all kinds of mixing and matching cards where you put the cards.
[00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:25.120]   There's not enough slots for them.
[00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:26.800]   They're not the right types of slots.
[00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:31.040]   And so, this one really, you know, because we're going to, you know, have a decked out
[00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:32.040]   one pretty soon.
[00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:36.840]   You know, 60, you know, with the whole 16 gigs, probably at least one, 4,500 in there,
[00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:39.520]   if not a couple, if we can get the tests working.
[00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:42.960]   And for us, when we're, as I said, we're working in motion or working in something that really
[00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:47.120]   or, you know, is a bigger 3D app, that's going to make a big difference.
[00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:50.520]   It's the extensibility for me more, because the speed, I think, was only a modest bump.
[00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:53.760]   I mean, we're only, it's a 1.5 to 2X.
[00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:54.760]   Right.
[00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:56.320]   Well, that's because the quad was so fast.
[00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:57.680]   I mean, right.
[00:34:57.680 --> 00:34:59.280]   That was a very fast box.
[00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:00.800]   So it's really not about speed, you're saying.
[00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:01.800]   It's about extensibility.
[00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:05.960]   For me, that's, that's what, what I'm most excited about is finally a computer that
[00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:08.960]   we can really, you know, extend it, which makes it a workstation.
[00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:11.760]   If I can't extend it well, I might as well just be using a laptop.
[00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:12.760]   Right.
[00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:17.400]   Any other stories that cut people's eyes, any other news in the Apple world that you
[00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:19.520]   think we should talk about?
[00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:22.800]   Well, the parallel announcement is pretty cool.
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:25.880]   There's a new version of parallel or a beta version?
[00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:27.880]   Yeah, beta version.
[00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:32.640]   And it brings us a lot closer to pure heaven on an Intel Mac.
[00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:34.960]   That is, parallel is already very cool.
[00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:40.880]   It's a $80 program that lets you run Windows XP in a window on an Intel Mac.
[00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:44.880]   Without having to restart, you can copy and paste between them.
[00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:46.880]   You could, they see each other's files.
[00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:48.800]   It's just totally great.
[00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:50.920]   So what's in the, in the new beta?
[00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:53.680]   Well, the thing is, it's, it's really, really fast.
[00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:56.360]   It's like 90% as fast as an actual PC.
[00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:57.360]   Oh, I love it.
[00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:59.760]   But that's not fast enough for 3D games.
[00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:01.680]   So they're working on 3D acceleration.
[00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:03.480]   So you'll have the games.
[00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:08.680]   They say they have fixed the problem that stops people like Leo and me from running naturally
[00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:10.680]   speaking in parallels.
[00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:15.720]   Actually what I had written about is how well this speech dictation program works under bootcamp.
[00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:18.960]   I bet, but I used it in parallels and it seemed like it worked.
[00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:19.960]   What is it?
[00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:20.960]   Oh, really?
[00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:21.960]   Yeah.
[00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:22.960]   I wasn't able to get it to work.
[00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:27.240]   I would, like for example, take the training part and it would just every 50th word, it
[00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:30.360]   would just choke and not hear what I was saying.
[00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:34.680]   And I never did get it to actually dictate more than a half a sentence at a time.
[00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:36.600]   And you had two gigs of RAM?
[00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:37.600]   Yeah.
[00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:38.600]   Yeah.
[00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:39.600]   It was on a MacBook Pro.
[00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:41.240]   But they say they've got all that ironed out.
[00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:42.240]   It's a point.
[00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:43.880]   It's a really performance issue then.
[00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:45.880]   I think it was a USB channeling.
[00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:48.560]   Oh, because I trained it, but I didn't use a USB mic.
[00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:49.960]   So maybe that's why.
[00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:51.920]   Oh, maybe that is what I was using.
[00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:52.920]   Yeah.
[00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:57.880]   But, and they also say that they've got it working out so that you can have, you can
[00:36:57.880 --> 00:36:59.720]   install Windows Vista on it.
[00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:01.640]   Oh, that's good news.
[00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:07.360]   And of course, the beauty of Parallels is that the entire thing is one file on your
[00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:09.520]   hard drive, one icon.
[00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:13.440]   And so what people are saying is duplicate that or back that up.
[00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:19.000]   And then if you ever get viruses or spyware or whatever, who cares, throw away that file,
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:26.600]   reinstate the one you made before the infection in your golden or you can run XP in one window
[00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:31.640]   and Windows Vista in another window or you can have multiple Windows XP's all in different
[00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:34.800]   Windows or Linux or Solaris or OS.
[00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:35.800]   Whatever you want.
[00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:36.800]   All of you.
[00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:37.800]   Well, well, well.
[00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:38.800]   Come down.
[00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:39.800]   Come down to.
[00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:40.800]   No, that's not Mac Classic.
[00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:43.800]   No matter what, no Mac Classic.
[00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:44.800]   No Mac Classic.
[00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:48.880]   You know, but I'm surprised that Apple has sort of seeded this territory to Parallels
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:51.320]   with when they talked about boot camp.
[00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:54.480]   It sounds like the same thing that you're going to have to reboot to get into Windows
[00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:56.280]   and go back to the Mac.
[00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:57.760]   Which just seems really clumsy to me.
[00:37:57.760 --> 00:37:59.640]   And that's what's so great about Parallels.
[00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:00.800]   You run them both at the same time.
[00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:02.160]   Of course you need a lot of memory.
[00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:03.160]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:04.440]   But why give that to Parallels?
[00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:05.800]   Why didn't Apple come up with something like that?
[00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:06.800]   It's interesting.
[00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:09.840]   Everybody thought that they might announce that kind of virtualization in Leopard.
[00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:12.680]   They may still yet, but they didn't say anything about it at the keynote.
[00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:16.120]   Well, in fact, Phil Schiller has said emphatically no.
[00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:17.840]   They're just not going to go there.
[00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:18.840]   I wonder why.
[00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:24.080]   And I think the reason is that Parallels involves a lot more cludging and working around and
[00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:26.760]   custom coding and all that boot camp.
[00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:30.480]   I'm under the impression it turns your Mac into a genuine PC.
[00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:32.920]   It's actually running Windows.
[00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:36.560]   And you know Steve Jobs, he doesn't like imperfect solutions.
[00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:43.000]   That's why they will never release a tiny, tiny laptop that requires an external DVD player.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.400]   He just hates that concept.
[00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:48.800]   He wants the perfect all-in-one solution with no compromises.
[00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:50.240]   Well there are other choices.
[00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:54.320]   The VMware has announced it's going to do a Macintosh virtualization solution.
[00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:58.320]   Of course it's really the king of this category on other platforms.
[00:38:58.320 --> 00:38:59.840]   They're really a good company.
[00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:01.960]   I'd be very interested to see what they do.
[00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:04.120]   They're going into beta soon.
[00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:07.920]   And Trans Gaming announced something called Cider.
[00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:08.920]   Have you seen this?
[00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:14.880]   It's designed to let you play Windows games inside of OS X.
[00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:16.360]   It's not like Parallels.
[00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:19.040]   It's not a separate kind of operating system.
[00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:22.000]   You actually play the Windows game in OS X.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   Wow.
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   Wow.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   Apparently nobody heard about that.
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   I wish it had time to play games.
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:33.640]   It's based on wine.
[00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:38.080]   So what it's doing is it's emulating Windows calls without actually putting Windows on
[00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:39.520]   your hard drive.
[00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:42.440]   If Steve doesn't like Parallels, he's going to hate Cider.
[00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:47.880]   Well I think that seems to be the end direction here is to get to a point where you're just
[00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:51.200]   opening Windows applications in OS X.
[00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:53.200]   Who needs Windows really?
[00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:56.240]   And wine of course is announced that the code weavers, people who do wine, which is
[00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:59.800]   the emulation layer for Linux, doesn't have any Windows.
[00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:04.080]   It just emulates Windows calls so a program thinks it's running inside Windows and it's
[00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:05.080]   not.
[00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:07.960]   They've said that they will also be doing an OS X version.
[00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:09.440]   Oh that is so cool.
[00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:14.120]   So there are going to be a lot of ways that you can get Windows programs running on the
[00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:15.120]   Mac.
[00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:19.940]   David, relative to our earlier conversation about market share, don't you think that's
[00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:23.160]   the kind of thing that could make a difference in market share?
[00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:26.040]   Well as we know it's sort of a mixed blessing.
[00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:28.920]   Chris Breen and I were just talking about this.
[00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:31.320]   It could attract a lot of people to the Mac.
[00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:36.000]   All these switchers who don't want to go cold turkey who want to keep their old Windows
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:41.680]   program around or people who need one Windows program that's not available for the Mac.
[00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:43.080]   That's all a big win.
[00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:48.440]   The big question is, is this going to make software companies less likely to do Mac versions
[00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:50.440]   because they say, "Well why should we bother?"
[00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:53.200]   You can just open up our Windows version right on the Mac.
[00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:57.200]   That was the fear that Photoshop wouldn't bother doing anymore.
[00:40:57.200 --> 00:41:01.280]   But I can't imagine Photoshop not having a Mac native version.
[00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:02.680]   Not for a while, no.
[00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:06.200]   Especially with all the designers using it, there's no way that...
[00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:09.200]   No designer wants to run Windows just so he can run Photoshop.
[00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:12.280]   They got deep pockets so they can afford to do this.
[00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:16.000]   Let's talk about some of the smaller developers who say, "Gee, I'm on a budget.
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:17.480]   I can't do this.
[00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:19.960]   Get Windows, put on your Mac and do it."
[00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:25.320]   The argument against that scenario was that everybody who wants to run one of these Windows
[00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:30.960]   programs has to have not only an Intel-based Mac but has to buy an installer copy of Windows
[00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:37.760]   which is $150 expenditure that Adobe and whoever can't assume everybody has made.
[00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:41.920]   But now that you're talking about these systems that do not require a copy of Windows that
[00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:48.040]   just run Windows and trick them, well then that argument about people not doing Mac versions
[00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:49.960]   becomes a little scarier.
[00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:50.960]   Good point.
[00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:54.240]   Well, it's been a really an interesting week.
[00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:59.240]   Not as interesting as it could have been had we had an iPod phone or a new giant screen
[00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:00.320]   video iPod.
[00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:03.360]   Are we ever going to get any of those?
[00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:06.080]   I think that the phone thing is one of the least plausible ones.
[00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:12.560]   I know people who worked for Palm on the Trio project and their lives were a living hell
[00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:17.120]   trying to get this thing through and the reason is the people who hold the power are
[00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:20.520]   the cell phone carriers, singular Verizon, etc.
[00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:25.040]   The person making the phone has so little say.
[00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:29.640]   Verizon will say, "We're not going to stop your phone unless you do the menus like this."
[00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:33.960]   I just cannot imagine Steve Jobs putting up with that or any of these guys putting up
[00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:34.960]   with that at Apple.
[00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:35.960]   I don't remember what's one.
[00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:37.640]   I would like to have one.
[00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:42.200]   I'd also like to have a new iPod video that really had a bigger screen.
[00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:46.240]   I think I've been playing with the iPod video for a while now and I just think the screen
[00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:50.280]   is way too small and it's not a good viewing experience at all.
[00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:54.520]   Hopefully we'll see them maybe flip the iPod and go horse off.
[00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:56.240]   Yeah, wait till September October you'll see.
[00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:57.480]   That does seem likely.
[00:42:57.480 --> 00:43:02.120]   Do you say that Mr. Secrets of the iPod with any inside knowledge or just?
[00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:03.120]   None at all.
[00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:06.160]   It's just the cycle of how they do things with iPods.
[00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:08.160]   It's been about a year at that time.
[00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:11.720]   Yeah, and the Christmas season is coming up so they need to announce something hot for
[00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:12.720]   September/October.
[00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:13.720]   They will.
[00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:15.840]   It'll be under everybody's tree and they'll make a ton of money.
[00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:19.520]   My daughter lost her iPod video and I said, "Well honey, don't worry because the new iPod
[00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:20.520]   will be out soon."
[00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:26.120]   I actually like those MyView glasses I was testing out on Call for Health a while ago,
[00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:28.120]   Leo, that hooked up to the iPod.
[00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:32.120]   She's got head-mounted display and this is very geeky stuff.
[00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:33.920]   I tried that out.
[00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:38.040]   How did that, I mean did your cerebellum pop out of your head or what?
[00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:39.480]   I actually think it's great.
[00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:42.560]   I mean it just, you know, it feels a little bit more like you're watching TV.
[00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:46.720]   The only thing is you look like you're straight out of Star Trek so you kind of have to compromise
[00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:51.840]   what's more important watching what's on your iPod video or, you know, looking kind
[00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:52.840]   of silly.
[00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:56.280]   You're not like walking down the street with this thing on or driving.
[00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:57.880]   No, but you could though.
[00:43:57.880 --> 00:44:00.960]   You could walk down the street because you have your peripheral vision so you're able
[00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:03.320]   to still walk while you're watching video off your iPod.
[00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:07.280]   So it's about $269 I think for the glasses.
[00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:10.280]   So, you know, it's kind of an interesting way to watch video.
[00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:11.600]   All the kids will be wearing them.
[00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:16.120]   Now did you get any kind of headache or did you get, how long did you watch it?
[00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:19.240]   I didn't watch it for too long but what I really want to test it on is when I go on
[00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:24.280]   a long flight somewhere so to be able to fly and use them and I don't anticipate getting
[00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:25.280]   a headache.
[00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:26.280]   I think it should be okay.
[00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:29.240]   I mean anything's better than cranking your neck down and trying to watch a two inch screen
[00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:30.240]   on your iPod.
[00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:31.240]   So, this is definitely worth it.
[00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:34.880]   Not to mention the wrist is holding that thing up for three hours.
[00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:37.920]   It gets heavy Leo.
[00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:39.960]   My experiences have been actually just the opposite.
[00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:47.520]   I've tried those glasses and they're really annoying to me for extended wear and on the
[00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:53.440]   other hand I did a little math and if you can compare the two inch screen of the iPod,
[00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:57.720]   you know, 18 inches from your face and compare that with the amount of your field of view
[00:44:57.720 --> 00:45:02.800]   that a 42 inch plasma across the room fills is pretty comparable.
[00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:03.800]   Really?
[00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:08.680]   So I actually, I mean, yes it's a small screen but it's also much closer to your face so
[00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:10.480]   I actually find it pretty immersive.
[00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:13.600]   But don't you still get tired holding it 18 inches from your face?
[00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:14.600]   Come on.
[00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:16.040]   No, no, I would not hold it.
[00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:20.400]   In fact, what I generally do is what I've, of course, almost anybody would do I remove
[00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:24.760]   my loafer and I put it on the tray table in front of me.
[00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:25.760]   It works beautifully.
[00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:30.320]   You put it in the heel is that it so it's resting in the heel?
[00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:34.480]   You put it in the heel and only the screen peeks over the top of the opening and you
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:37.120]   look like a complete crazy person.
[00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:39.480]   It's a conversation starter.
[00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:42.200]   So are the my view glasses.
[00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:43.200]   That's true.
[00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:45.040]   We should get them both.
[00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:46.040]   We should get them both.
[00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:52.720]   You would do 30 inch power book and your loafer TV stand and remember whether data glasses.
[00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:56.320]   I ask you who looks who's the first person you wouldn't talk to.
[00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:59.960]   And on that note, I think we better wrap this thing up.
[00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:02.960]   This is our first episode of Mac break weekly and not our last.
[00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:06.560]   We hope we can do this every week and boy, I'm really glad we could get some of the best
[00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:10.160]   people in the business to start things off with such a bang.
[00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:12.280]   David Pogue, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:13.280]   My pleasure.
[00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:18.920]   We'll look for you in the New York Times and of course your blog online where which Steve
[00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:22.560]   apparently reads even though he belittles it.
[00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:25.280]   Maybe he has people who read it for him.
[00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:26.280]   Exactly.
[00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:29.160]   Chris Breen, any new books coming out?
[00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:34.320]   I'm working on the updates to the iPod books but still waiting to see what Apple does in
[00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:35.320]   the next month or two.
[00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:38.240]   Notice I didn't ask David that because we wouldn't have time as he gave us the list
[00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:40.240]   of books coming out.
[00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:44.520]   You actually sold the missing manuals, didn't you do it to somebody to a Riley?
[00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:48.240]   I did but I'm still obligated to do five books a year.
[00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:49.240]   Oh my God.
[00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:50.240]   All by myself.
[00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:51.640]   Oh my God.
[00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:57.840]   And I have to tell you, I am so glad that Apple delayed or not delayed but Apple is taking
[00:46:57.840 --> 00:47:01.760]   the advantage of its escape clause for the Leopard release date.
[00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:08.840]   They had said the end of 2006 or early 2007 and I'm already deep into this Windows Vista
[00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:15.240]   book and I was looking at the end of my life when I considered doing the both at once.
[00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:19.080]   So they're saying the spring 2007 now, actually a couple of months after Vista.
[00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:20.920]   So you can have some time off.
[00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:23.360]   I think we're going on a Mac Mania cruise in the fall.
[00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:25.520]   So yeah, that'll be a blast.
[00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:30.760]   Maybe a five to the Western Caribbean.
[00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:32.800]   Chris, are you going on that or you did you get a big?
[00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:33.800]   I'm not.
[00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:36.760]   I did the Mediterranean with David and how was that?
[00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:38.680]   You guys went on the Mediterranean one?
[00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:39.680]   Yeah.
[00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:41.240]   Dude, it was unbelievable.
[00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:46.600]   It was an unbelievable Spain, Italy, Monaco, France and Tunisia, Africa.
[00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:47.600]   I'm so jealous.
[00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:48.600]   I really wanted to go on that one.
[00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:52.880]   But I've already gone on three geek cruises this year, so I really had to draw the line
[00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:53.880]   somewhere.
[00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:58.080]   I'm going on the chess cruise in a couple of weeks to Alaska and then we'll do Mac Mania
[00:47:58.080 --> 00:47:59.080]   5.
[00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:00.080]   I'm looking forward to that.
[00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:04.000]   Amber MacArthur, we look forward to seeing you on Command N, Tarrant, Call for Help and
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:07.880]   Inside the Net on the twit.tv network.
[00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:08.960]   Thank you for being here today.
[00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:10.200]   Yeah, thanks for having me.
[00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:11.200]   It's been fun.
[00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:14.080]   Don't tell David we're working on a book because you know how he is.
[00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:16.400]   We won't say a word.
[00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:17.400]   Shh.
[00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:20.720]   And I'm glad you didn't post about it on your blog, Leo.
[00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:21.720]   Oh, whoops.
[00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:26.680]   I was so excited, David, because we're using subversion.
[00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:31.720]   I thought this was really wacky, which is a versioning system you like programmers use
[00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:33.200]   to keep track of versions.
[00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:35.480]   Because we're collaborating together on the book, we're going to use subversion to keep
[00:48:35.480 --> 00:48:37.880]   track of version changes and so forth.
[00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:38.880]   This will be very interesting.
[00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:39.880]   Wow.
[00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:40.880]   Yeah.
[00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:41.880]   You're so technical.
[00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:42.880]   So hip.
[00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:45.880]   I'm in terminal right now trying to set it up, Leo, so I need you after this.
[00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:48.080]   I'll give you the commands in a moment.
[00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:53.440]   And of course, Alex Lindsey, who is keeping very busy at Pixelcore with all of your projects,
[00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:56.520]   including Mac Break the Video Show.
[00:48:56.520 --> 00:48:59.240]   We just posted one on Monday.
[00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:00.240]   Automator.
[00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:01.240]   Automator.
[00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:04.240]   Oh, we got a new one coming out from us now.
[00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:09.800]   New one from Sal on Automator on using your phone for uploading stuff.
[00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:10.800]   Oh, that's cool.
[00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:11.800]   When will that be?
[00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:12.800]   It's up.
[00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:13.800]   It should be up now.
[00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:14.800]   Oh, all right.
[00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:17.360]   This is August 7th, which was a couple of days ago, DV Matt Blass.
[00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:23.040]   So by the time you hear this, Sal Saguayan will be gracing the top of Twit.tv with a
[00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:24.040]   new Mac break.
[00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:30.480]   And of course, you've got this week in media and many other adventures, Pixelcore.com.
[00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:31.960]   Anybody else want any other plugs?
[00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:32.960]   This is your chance.
[00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:34.920]   Oh, I like Zone.
[00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:36.880]   I like Zone.
[00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:37.880]   Dot com.
[00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:38.880]   No.
[00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:39.880]   Yeah.
[00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:40.880]   Is it?
[00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:41.880]   Well, it is.
[00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:43.040]   I like Zone is another podcast.
[00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:45.120]   And you guys do this other podcast.
[00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:46.920]   Yeah, it's another Pixelcore.
[00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:51.640]   Well, we have a lot of Scott Borne and Derek's story.
[00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:53.320]   And it's really, really good.
[00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:54.800]   I forget all of that.
[00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:55.800]   I was listening to it.
[00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:57.400]   I was sitting there helping to engineer some of the stuff.
[00:49:57.400 --> 00:49:58.800]   And I've been helping with some of that stuff.
[00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:00.400]   And we're going to be recording here again, I guess.
[00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:05.160]   You know, between the five of us, we must be doing like 39 blogs and podcasts.
[00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:08.240]   I think that's going to be inevitable.
[00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:12.880]   The inevitable end result of this is that five years from now, there will be one reader
[00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:13.880]   for every blog.
[00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:17.880]   Yeah, that's what I've been hoping for, a one to one correspondence between podcasters
[00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:18.880]   and podcastees.
[00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:21.760]   Do you have a podcast, David?
[00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:22.760]   I do.
[00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:23.760]   You know, it's a funny story.
[00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:29.400]   My wife did not read my New York Times columns, which is the subject of some friction
[00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:31.440]   in the relationship.
[00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:33.440]   She claimed it was because she didn't have time.
[00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:36.640]   And I'm like, but Jennifer, you read all these books every year.
[00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:38.000]   And she goes, I don't read.
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:39.000]   I listen to them.
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:40.480]   They're books on disk.
[00:50:40.480 --> 00:50:42.400]   And like, okay, fine.
[00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:46.760]   I'm going to record my column and put it in your iTunes to make you listen to them.
[00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:48.280]   And she's like, well, I love that.
[00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:50.000]   In fact, why don't you offer that to the Times?
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:51.800]   I bet there's lots of people.
[00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:54.400]   It was like a great idea.
[00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:57.120]   So now I read my column every Thursday.
[00:50:57.120 --> 00:50:58.680]   It's on iTunes.
[00:50:58.680 --> 00:50:59.840]   Podcasting baby.
[00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:00.840]   It's happening.
[00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:02.140]   I know.
[00:51:02.140 --> 00:51:03.140]   But you're right.
[00:51:03.140 --> 00:51:04.440]   We are doing too many podcasts now.
[00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:06.240]   Nobody can listen to them all.
[00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:07.240]   That is an issue.
[00:51:07.240 --> 00:51:09.240]   We're going to have to address to some point.
[00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:10.240]   All right, gang.
[00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:11.680]   Hey, thank you so much.
