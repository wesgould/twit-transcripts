[00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.280]   joining us who eclipse headquarters
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.200]   in
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.600]   Massachusetts
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:10.640]   Little bit too bright out there for me today. I wish we were I wish we're still in eclipse where that fireball was gone for a while
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:17.560]   I don't know what happened also with us Renee Richie from Montreal where they couldn't see anything I was eclipsed Leo you were eclipsed
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.160]   I'm I like seeing the data like I like seeing the traffic patterns of all the people trying to get there and then like the temperature
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:29.960]   Graph of what what it changed during the eclipse. How much you've been changed a lot, right like yeah somebody I saw one
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:35.520]   Report five degrees another one said 20 degrees. I guess depends where you were or just keep it there
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.800]   We'll fix our weather some of our team was up there our editor Anthony Nielsen our it guy Russell Tammany
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:48.480]   My studio manager Jamerby John Slain where their Anthony has everybody's working on posting their pictures
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.880]   But Anthony posted this little video
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.040]   from
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.960]   They were up in Oregon Mitchell, Oregon sitting in a field
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.160]   There's Anthony and Russell and Shannon Morse
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.160]   from tech thing and
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.160]   Watch it's gonna. This is a time-lapse. It's gonna get this is this is
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:14.080]   Pointing his camera the wrong way through the totality as it gets darker and listen to the crowds because there's other people around I guess
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.000]   And as it gets darker
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.280]   Darker
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.320]   They can even more excited
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.120]   That's pretty cool. Someone's blotting out the Sun. Yeah
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.960]   That's pretty neat and then
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.160]   And then there's also a picture Russell says I'm still processing my shots
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.200]   Let me see if I can find that this one, but he posted a picture. He took his very fancy
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:49.000]   Sony a 9 camera and a hugely expensive lens and you could see in the viewfinder there
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:54.160]   That he's getting a very nice image. So I look forward to seeing
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:01.280]   His pictures of the clips. I hope you all enjoyed. Was this a Lex Luthor planned it Superman have to save us
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.280]   I'm very
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.840]   I love the guy who posted on Facebook the day before you know
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:13.280]   There seems to be consensus among scientists that there'll be an eclipse, but can you really trust scientists and
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.800]   Maybe they're wrong and you know and anyway
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.440]   Well when you say stuff like that you start to disprove evolution so you never know it's just it only begins with the eclipse
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.360]   We don't have much to say this week, do we?
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.640]   I mean there's stuff. There's things Leo things
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.800]   There's stuff, but not much stuff. Never stopped us before
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.120]   I guess we should kick things off with
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:43.640]   Do we have any idea when apples gonna do an event have been any clues at all?
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.360]   September
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.600]   But it could be October right I mean for a while their rumors are gonna be delayed with this
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.480]   now there's no there a lot
[00:04:53.480 --> 00:05:00.040]   Now there are a lot of people that are saying that the I if there is a super splendorferous iPhone 8 coming out
[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:05.080]   That that might not ship at the same time as the iPhone 7s the updated iPhone 7
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.000]   So you never know maybe they'll have like a second
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.200]   mini event just to make that seem so special or
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.760]   Wall Street people would lose it if Apple didn't have an event like it's not really it's not reality
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.520]   It's perception management and if they didn't have a September event
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.880]   They would just be panic up and down Wall Street and there would be so many headlines Leo that I would just fall down
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.960]   But nobody there's no guarantee apples moved events before
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:36.600]   They had traditionally had a September and October event they stopped doing that but the first time was announced in January and shipped in June so
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:41.680]   Yeah, but that was that that was back in years ago
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:48.880]   It was president so I mean this at this. I mean Bernays right at the the amount of
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:55.480]   Earth that Apple is willing to move to make sure that the iPhone hits a September launched launch date is
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.840]   They'll they'll move heaven and earth
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:04.360]   They'll the the eclipse could have been just a test run for what they need to do to make sure that they get 3d touch working on the new
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:10.560]   Screen technology so don't I think you can count on an event in September whether or not there's a second iPhone event later on
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:18.280]   Is totally new territory because we've never had a situation where we're gonna there were there kind of forking the iPhone if they do
[00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:23.760]   If they do go together with this rumored idea of a super splendor for his iPhone, so yeah
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:25.480]   We do have precedent
[00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:30.060]   I mean like two years it was a two years ago where they did a mega event and they had the iPhones and because everything sort of
[00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:33.680]   Nothing was ready earlier. So they had the iPhones. They had the first iPad Pro
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.680]   They had the new Apple TV and the list just went on and on
[00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.840]   I mean the demo rooms just went on and on and not everything came out at once the iPhones came out
[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:42.440]   And they usually did and then the iPad came out
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:46.440]   I think the Apple TV came out and then the iPads came out and it was like two weeks four weeks six weeks
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.280]   So there's nothing to stop them having in a September event
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:53.400]   They're just saying this will be available in limited quantities in October or to November or whatever
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:56.640]   Yeah, it's it's hard. It's a long list of things that are stacked up
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:59.560]   We've got iPhone 7s
[00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:02.840]   We're looking they're thinking about a simple bump on the iPhone 7
[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:07.080]   We're thinking another phone called the iPhone 8 or the super splendor for his iPhone
[00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:13.240]   So that's that's called that a second product line. We've got rumors of an updated Apple watch. That's a third product. We have
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.560]   good rumors about a
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:21.720]   Updated version of the Apple TV that does at least HDR. So that's five
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:28.280]   They have a they have the home they have the home pod which they at least want to show functioning
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:35.960]   So that's number six. They might want to show off and I make sure people remember that the iMac is still a pressing concern
[00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:37.960]   So that's seven and that's
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:41.480]   Isn't the iMac Pro supposed to come out this year, right?
[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:48.600]   This year but I feel I feel like we're gonna see December 28th 2930 and there'll be five of them
[00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:53.240]   There'll be five of them on the 25. Oh, there's president the Mac Pro last Mac Pro was announced
[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:57.000]   But not really didn't really come into people's hands until January, but it was announced roughly that
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:59.400]   They ship five. I mean, that's all you need
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:02.360]   So I you're right and even that's at least seven
[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:06.440]   Things they could talk about and that's not including software
[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:11.960]   And the software they've been they've been pushing out so much now like they just put out a whole bunch of videos for ios 11 that they
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:17.160]   Don't usually do and it feels like they want to get they want to get past that part of the conversation so they can dive into that deep hardware
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.280]   pile
[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:23.400]   Well, not not only that but it feels like there's stuff that they can't show off until they show off the hardware
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:30.040]   So people already know about how the new file launcher is going to work people already know about how the new dock
[00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:36.200]   New dock work so may as well push the get those the get those videos finished and shipped out so that in
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:39.640]   September or october whenever they're going to do this they can now talk about well
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:46.760]   Here is how to put here's here's how to align the magnets on your desk so that the new ipad does hover mode correctly without falling off the table
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:49.400]   They are they did just put out
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:55.720]   Developer beta 7 right of ios 11 and the public beta is now up to six
[00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:58.680]   I was surprised to get an update so quickly after
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:03.400]   Five came out so doing it really fast. I've been hustling
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:11.080]   Which kind of does indicate that we're close to the release date. I hope they don't do what i did you see what google did yesterday
[00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:14.680]   We are you yeah, so
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:18.520]   So google says on i think thursday or friday of last week
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:23.240]   We're gonna have an event we went right after the eclipse we're gonna have an event and announcing android. Oh
[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:28.680]   And uh, so we all hands on deck when i you know that we're in a live stream it so we you know
[00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:38.440]   We we arrange to broadcast as we do i i was going to be here and then i realized i had already a prior engagement to do a radio show in san francisco
[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:44.920]   Uh, and uh i tried to get out of that couldn't and but we got jason and and florin sion came in and
[00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:48.040]   And it was it was this it was
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:50.040]   It was
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:55.960]   The countdown there was nobody on stage. There was a stage out in a park in new york city where people were watching the eclipse
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:10:01.320]   There's a lot of smoke it opens up and there's a robot cookie and oreo
[00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:06.120]   It's a superhero. Yo really the only announcement was the o stands for oreo
[00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:11.000]   And kind of apple did this imagine how pissed off people would be
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:17.560]   It's over apple apple didn't that was it. I mean, that's it. That's all they did. Nobody said anything even
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:21.320]   And i feel bad for jason florin so i come in and cover this
[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:24.680]   Non-event
[00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:26.680]   Uh, but we know we don't cook. We fell for it
[00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:32.040]   I was I was thinking oatmeal cookie because I didn't think they wanted to do a brand name again, but they they apparently did so
[00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:36.920]   But that's off the point who cares about androi we're talking about ios here
[00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:41.960]   We're talking iphone a lot of excitement about i'm excited about the new iphone
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:47.320]   Uh, and i have to say there there were there've been points in the last few years where i swear i'm not buying another iphone
[00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:48.920]   darn it
[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:54.760]   And this was probably you have to yeah, well i have to and i want to and this one's going to be expensive
[00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:58.280]   We think right over maybe did you see those videos that they found in the latest firmware?
[00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:02.840]   We had almost like webOS style card gestures. I was so excited. I don't know if they're gonna do them or not
[00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:07.320]   But that those videos were very appealing to me. Well, uh, let me see if i can find those
[00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:13.560]   Well, this was for ios 11 and iphone yeah, and it might it was those might have been there was were buried
[00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:19.320]   So there's they might have been experiments that they tried and decided not to go with or they might be something put that in the firmware
[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:24.600]   I mean i normally yells leo but since that home pod leak nothing is beyond me anymore
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:29.800]   Yeah, well no i mean but the thing is you're not going to put something in the firmware that you're not gonna
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:32.840]   I mean that's just wasting space
[00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:36.600]   Yeah, or somebody like what they destroyed my idea and i want to get publicity on it
[00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:43.000]   So we're sticking those back into the back here here are the twitter videos from uh giyama rambo
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:45.880]   Um, so this is a gesture
[00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:52.520]   Right, so you're limited in the amount of gestures bevel gestures you can do you have basic sorry bezel gestures
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:57.320]   You have basically one for each side which they're already using all those so if they put something else at the bottom
[00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:03.240]   You have to move control center to the top and that's what that showed it showed control center added to notification center in the top gesture
[00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:08.440]   Let me play it again. So now that i understand so i pull down the screen i just scroll left
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:14.280]   For your widgets right for the uh widgets or the control center other and then they scroll up
[00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:18.600]   For settings which is kind of nice. Well, he was on settings already
[00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:22.360]   To go back. Let's look at the other video then. Okay, so
[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:25.480]   I'll show you why they did that says this is also interesting so
[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:30.600]   Um, he's now just to use to get just okay. Oh, whoa. Okay. I know
[00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:35.480]   Okay, let's get this straight. So he's looking at uh instagram or something
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:36.840]   uh
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.680]   he now
[00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:45.080]   Swipes up from the bottom with his thumb and he gets recents right i've loved that ever since webOS the app switcher
[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:50.200]   And then on the okay, oh, this is interesting
[00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:54.680]   Well, okay that that would make sense if you're getting if you're getting rid of the home button
[00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:58.440]   Remember that's how you get to the launch of the app switcher is you double tap on the home launcher
[00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:00.120]   So perhaps that's a
[00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:03.240]   Perhaps that would support the idea that there's not going to be a clicky home button
[00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:07.640]   That's going to be completely virtual or just eliminated entirely and then there's a control center
[00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:10.120]   uh
[00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:11.480]   On the right
[00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:14.840]   Yeah, the car committee a mini doc mini and i get presuming you could swipe that
[00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:17.240]   Wait, is that no wait is that or is that just the
[00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:22.200]   Is that just the left edge of that card? I would guess that's the left edge of that car
[00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:26.760]   It's coming in so like it looks like it's being added to the stock at the end in case you want to quickly get to
[00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:32.680]   Right and maybe and you know, maybe you can swipe over there if they wanted more the top cut the okay
[00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:36.200]   Maybe i see i see cards populating in from the left as well
[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:42.200]   Yeah, the left is the other i think the left is the standard ones right the left is your hierarchy of reasons. Yeah
[00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:48.920]   Okay, so um these have to be in there these solve the problem right that you you have of
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:52.520]   Uh, you don't have a home button anymore
[00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:59.400]   And they were certainly interesting although it's weird that look at the look at the as look at the aspect ratio of that screen
[00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:02.280]   There's room at the bottom there for a physical home button
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:08.040]   I would expect to have seen that on something where they've made the screen larger or done something to justify
[00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:12.760]   Here's why we got rid of that that's because giermo doesn't have the new iphone. He just has the software
[00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:15.640]   Oh, okay
[00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:18.360]   Giermo needs the new iphone to really make this sing
[00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:22.040]   Um, if you take away the home button you have more screen real estate
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:23.800]   That's the reason to take away the home button
[00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:30.280]   But i'm i'm a little worried because i still find myself in apps where the only thing i can find to do to get out of a
[00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:33.560]   Particular screen is go back home your escape hatch. Yeah
[00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:39.400]   What do we do if we don't have that if if the swipe up from the bottom is now simply the home button
[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:41.560]   Essentially that does the same action
[00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:46.040]   That people get used to it. Uh, also it solves the problem that I was
[00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:51.480]   Struggling with was how do you deal with somebody who has who can't see the screen?
[00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:55.720]   Uh, how can that person then find it's it's very good to have a physical
[00:14:56.280 --> 00:15:00.760]   Clicky button or something with a physical bump on it so that you can orient it in your hand and find
[00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:03.560]   And find it in your hand correctly
[00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:07.240]   That might mitigate that by simply saying if you can't see if you can't get a good look at the phone
[00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:09.320]   You just know that swipe up from the bottom
[00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:15.400]   Although now you've run into the problem of how do I how do I make sure that i'm holding it correctly with the top side up
[00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:21.960]   In my hand just by feel so you know, this is a tough thing for these kinds of interfaces in microsoft
[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:26.840]   Learned at their peril that having kind of these hidden gestures
[00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:31.400]   Really confuses people for with windows 8 and 8.1
[00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:36.440]   They hid a lot of stuff in corners and things and you were just supposed to somehow
[00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:41.000]   Do you veos as well? Do you remember that like you had to almost do incantations to bring up the hub and to do
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.400]   And that's the dangers that you only have a very small amount of gross gestures that are easily understandable
[00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:50.600]   Basically the the eight corners of the device and really only four if you want them to be super easy to use
[00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:55.720]   And after that you're drawing patterns on the screen and it feels almost like the new doc and multitasking
[00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:59.720]   I feel like i'm i'm dealing cards when i'm using it
[00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:03.080]   But when you see people use it for the first time is like how do I hold this to put it on the side?
[00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:04.600]   How do I hold it to overlay it?
[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:08.920]   How do I set up the two apps this way and there's a much deeper learning curve for those kinds of gestures?
[00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:11.560]   I mean, it's just the way it is it's tough because you don't have
[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:14.600]   A lot of affordances you have to make it work
[00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:20.760]   Google is apparently htc's done this with their htc u11 and google is apparently going to adopt it for a pixel
[00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:22.360]   A squeeze gesture
[00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:26.760]   Yeah, where you use you pop up up up up you squeeze the phone
[00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:30.040]   And I guess that's going to be the google assistant
[00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:35.800]   I I feel like there should there needs to be something like that if you're gonna take away the home button there needs to be some
[00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:39.960]   gesture that's always available and somewhat intuitive to
[00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:42.600]   That that does the home button doesn't there
[00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:49.160]   Is a big rumor that both apple and google and other manufacturers really want to get rid of every hardware button and every port if they can because they
[00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:55.400]   Consider those areas of hardware failure and the more they can virtualize the the more reliable all of their devices will be
[00:16:55.400 --> 00:17:00.760]   And google's apparently getting there faster with ironically no user ever has said that but
[00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:07.400]   Well, remember in china there was that story about how they would put on the virtual home button because they were paranoid about the real hold but breaking
[00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:12.040]   Well, google's always had or often had both
[00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:17.960]   On screen home button and the physical home button and some of their some phones like the same song
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:24.440]   Although rumor is it will find out tomorrow the note eight is going to be announced tomorrow that that also sam's i'm going to
[00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:29.320]   Eliminate its physical home button. I mean you have to if you want more screen real estate and everybody
[00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:36.440]   Everybody see I think this is something users can have converged on more screen real estate is something we all want. Yes
[00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:42.920]   Um, maybe it really depends on the user. I think that's still a premium phone sort of feature
[00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:47.400]   We're seeing a lot of really great things happening down the three hundred dollar to four hundred dollar space
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:54.280]   And those phones are selling really well even though they just simply have a very large screen that they and they also have a certain amount of bezel
[00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:58.280]   For now. I think that deleting bezel increasing screen size is
[00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:03.560]   Right now more of a fashion thing than a practical thing. It does have practical
[00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:08.040]   Impact and that again bigger screen without making a bigger phone
[00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:15.080]   But realize that every single company that makes a really big phone also makes a more moderate sized phone because
[00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:18.840]   People don't not everybody wants anything that's even that size
[00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:21.720]   So I think I think it remains to be seen whether or not this is
[00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:26.680]   How much this is fashion and how much this is the direction that people want to go with their phones? Yeah
[00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:30.280]   uh, so
[00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:35.320]   Will the apple event be held at the new apple park
[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:40.360]   We've been talking about that. I want to go. I'd love it to be
[00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:45.320]   I don't know if they're ready for us yet. I'm trying to think well. There's new drone footage
[00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:49.160]   Oh, this came out after our show last week
[00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:51.720]   the latest 4k
[00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:55.560]   apple drone tour and let's see if we can see
[00:18:55.560 --> 00:19:01.080]   How much we think of the older drone footage and when it was barely assembled and now looking at it now
[00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:04.040]   It's almost done. I mean that the landscaping is almost done
[00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:10.200]   You can see how it really is beautiful. They call it apple park and it's starting to look more and more parked like that by the way
[00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:13.560]   Is the steve jobs theater? We're looking at in the distance
[00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:18.120]   And I think it's conceivable that this could be ready to go in a week or two
[00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:23.080]   That's the road leading to it the curvy road there right and while there's still stuff
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:30.280]   You know happening it. It looks it's drivable. It's not a big particularly if if the
[00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:35.960]   Invitation says you're we're going to reconnoiter at a ramaa in parking lot. Oh, I'd bust you in
[00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:39.400]   Yeah, San Jose and then bust you in there. Yeah bring your heart in
[00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:43.320]   But i'm not sure that even they want to deal with even that
[00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:47.560]   Something is going to have to be the first event at the app at the new apple campus
[00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:52.520]   It's going to happen eventually why i'm sure they wanted to do it for the 10th anniversary. I phone
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:53.640]   I mean what did you see?
[00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:59.960]   Well, but but but also is this the company that would want you to drive past a drive on a road that hasn't been
[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:04.840]   That hasn't been landscape hasn't been finished that looks like it's still got some planting to do
[00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:12.360]   That still has you can see you can look across the campus and still see employees beating their heads against their deaths because they've missed their cubicles
[00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:14.440]   They don't like being in within view of everybody
[00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:18.440]   And I've also heard I don't know if this is reliable or if this this will change
[00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:24.120]   But I've heard that they're really not that that precious about the 10th anniversary thing that it's 10th anniversary great whatever
[00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:29.800]   Here's what's next. It's not one of those things. Well, then if that's the case then they definitely won't have it here
[00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:34.200]   Because this is not I mean as as close as they are. It's not three weeks, sir
[00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:37.640]   I will I will make one prediction. I think that whenever then
[00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:42.840]   Wherever the next event is and maybe it's not going to be on the apple campus. You're going to see
[00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:52.440]   Five to maybe eight journalists come up with really great pictures of the apple campus right seven days after that right?
[00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:54.520]   Why seven days?
[00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:57.400]   I'm just pulling a number out. I think that I think that somebody will visit
[00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:02.600]   I think I think that over the over the two or three days they know the people are going to be there
[00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:05.480]   They're going to extend invitations to certain very very select people
[00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:08.760]   They're going to give them each a personal tour and then
[00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:15.960]   Mashable on Wednesday after the after that event are going to have a photo spread and you know and conversations with whomever
[00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:18.760]   Was leading them on the tourist and I don't believe it's going to be a group thing
[00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:24.040]   But I would be surprised if apple didn't take advantage of that the world has changed in some interesting ways
[00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:27.000]   David pogue brought together the four journalists
[00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:33.880]   Four count them four who got the iphone in 2007 before anybody else did three of them were walt mossberg
[00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:39.000]   Yeah, walt mossberg david from the wall street journal david pogue from the new york times
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:47.800]   Ed beg of usa today and steven levi of newsweek of those four only one is still at his publication
[00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:49.880]   I think ed beg still at the usa today
[00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:57.480]   And I wouldn't say any of those four were any are likely to get a pre-release of uh of any iphone that comes out
[00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:02.680]   Although steven levi did get the first article about apple park in wired magazine
[00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:07.000]   Uh, did you see john yi refuting the tree story that was hilarious?
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:13.320]   No, so which tree story there was a story that john yi was just basically pillaging every tree in san francis
[00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:17.560]   There were no trees to be bad. Yeah, yeah, he was just he was like strip mining california trees
[00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:23.080]   And he said that's ridiculous. This has been meticulously planned for yas when does not simply acquire this many trees on the spur of the moment
[00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:27.800]   Something I decided two weeks ago. Oh, no, I need trees. I need tree and you know what that's completely right
[00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:33.800]   Those people flattering themselves to think that their city trees are up to apple standards
[00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:37.800]   I don't think so well, but I have to say looking at that video
[00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:42.120]   Those are the the plantings look very nice the trees particular look very mature
[00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:45.720]   And all you have to do is get whatever else is gonna still they're still in dirt
[00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:49.560]   Although I have to say those look like mostly what pines and redwoods, right?
[00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:54.760]   Um, you can't plant anything under a redwood the needles are so acidic that
[00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:58.920]   Everything dies. All you'll have is pine needles under there. I didn't know that yeah
[00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:03.800]   So if they do plant something under there, they're gonna be replanting it on a frequent basis
[00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:06.280]   Not that i'm putting apple
[00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:10.280]   Putting that they should have put an apple tree somebody said you're right mashed potato and charamises
[00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:14.120]   What about apple trees? Wasn't it an apricot orchard that steve jobs prunes?
[00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:16.760]   Yeah prune plum orchard. Yeah
[00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:19.960]   That whole area was mostly a prune trees
[00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:23.800]   And they would keep apple employees regular as well see it's double
[00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:27.240]   In fact the big mall near there is called the prune yard
[00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:35.160]   Wow, which is not on the face of it a very felicitous name for a mall and in fact they're not doing all that well, but uh, you know, that's
[00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:36.840]   historic it was
[00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:39.560]   It was what they're yeah, they know I guess they want they don't want fruit trees
[00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:43.960]   But I think fruit trees would might have been a little bit nicer and certainly truer to uh steve jobs
[00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:47.240]   Who was for many years of fruit eterion? Yes
[00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:50.680]   Uh, all right, so let's see
[00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:56.760]   We've already said all the rumors. I've at this point. They've been so repeated that I think they're now truth
[00:23:56.760 --> 00:24:03.720]   Z Z will be very surprised if it isn't for instance an OLED screen that reaches almost to the very edges
[00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:07.160]   Of the front of the phone will be very surprised if
[00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:11.640]   They haven't replaced touch id with face recognition and if that face recognition
[00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:15.640]   If they're gonna do that it has to work so well that it just knows
[00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:18.520]   Practically, it's just your presence
[00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:22.040]   milliseconds. Yeah, well and it should work on a lot flat on the table, right?
[00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:26.280]   So you your phone you the by any point that you want to access your phone
[00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:30.520]   It should be able to see your face and know it's you and not you wouldn't have to do anything if it does that
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:35.640]   It's almost like it has like several cameras in it like an infrared camera regular camera 3d sensing camera
[00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:41.160]   It's almost you know, it's gonna happen for ar kit right? That's the other thing. This is going to be the ar phone
[00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:48.360]   Uh, that's slightly so yeah, so I mean there'll be a camera that's also worked really well with ar both front and back
[00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:51.160]   And they're doing some I've seen some awesome developer demos that aren't out yet
[00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:55.880]   But it's like they're the basic ones like ikea that we've all seen or the star wars chest that we've played
[00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:58.360]   But there are other ones I know you've seen similar demos Leo
[00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:03.080]   But these are done with ar kit where you're in the real world and you open a door and you walk into a virtual world
[00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:05.800]   And you walk back out the door you're in the real world you walk into the door again
[00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:08.440]   You're in a virtual world and they're doing something so smart
[00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:12.520]   They're they're doing all the tracking and the basic ar overhead on the cpu
[00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:19.240]   And that leaves the GPU completely open to developers for these huge textures and models and lighting effects
[00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:23.800]   And it doesn't it doesn't look totally real but it doesn't look like uncanny either
[00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:28.840]   It's like a really good a really good like a good enough lighting good enough textures good enough models
[00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:31.800]   That it feels almost like a cartoon movie world
[00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:37.320]   What and you know, we've talked a lot about what kinds of applications here's one from mody face
[00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:40.440]   For a makeup demo
[00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:43.320]   And now this is kind of like a snapchat filter
[00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:49.880]   She's doing a selfie but she could pick her lipstick shade and what's really different is how completely accurate
[00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:56.600]   I mean much more so than a snapchat a demo how completely accurate the lipstick is applied to her face
[00:25:56.600 --> 00:26:01.960]   And and I it look now what's kind of confusing about this is it looks like
[00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:04.680]   You're actually in a store
[00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:09.000]   And you are except that there are displays of you
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.080]   With with different makeup on right there in the store
[00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:20.840]   Actually when she moves into it, you could see the little error there where she actually kind of confuses the the ar kit
[00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:26.280]   And some of the apps are really honest and they show you all the dots that are continuously measuring to try to detect planes
[00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:29.000]   Yeah
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.640]   This is different eye shadow different lipstick makeup. Here's a here's another
[00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:36.360]   video. This is
[00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:43.400]   Virtual makeup counter so you've you've all seen department store makeovers. She's walked up to a
[00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:47.880]   Ar counter looks like a real counter in a store
[00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:55.080]   Even the marble on the countertop matches the marble on the floor. It's loaded up with I have to say they look a little 2d
[00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:58.440]   makeup and pictures of her
[00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:03.960]   Um, she could do she can do her own augmented reality makeover
[00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:06.360]   But I those products are very flat
[00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:11.160]   I guess that's weird. Yeah, but they don't need to be I guess I mean
[00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:16.760]   It's an interesting demo. I guess is the point but it what it proves is is
[00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:23.720]   It's the answer to the question I've asked which is what is the useful application of this and that I can
[00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:25.080]   We can think of a few now
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:31.160]   I'm I'm looking forward to more of those demos that don't just show you how to how it's going to help people sell things to me
[00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:37.400]   And it's where it's going to help people like when the one the most interesting I didn't see it as a demo
[00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:39.720]   But someone described it to me as uh where
[00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:42.120]   a
[00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:44.920]   You're you're at a concert or you're an event with somebody
[00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:48.440]   Or you're at a concert or you're an event and you want to know hey is
[00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:52.280]   Is this looks like the sort of thing that that Renee would be at?
[00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:55.720]   I said there are like the 10,000 pokemon people here in Boston
[00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:59.000]   I wonder for nays in here and I just simply activate my app hold it up
[00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:02.680]   and I will see like Renee's avatar and a pointer like
[00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:08.040]   Way in the direction that I know the boss in common is an an I could just basically because he has turned on this beacon feature
[00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:12.520]   Find him in a crowd whether it's at a rock concert or whether it's at at the beach or whatever
[00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:19.000]   Just stuff like that is really going to sell this the idea of again placing iKEA furniture in your living room
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.520]   It's going to be nice
[00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:27.560]   But I think there's going to be one of those apps that a million people downloaded then eight people actually buy things based on it
[00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:31.400]   The other thing that two things that one thing to be kind of glossed over
[00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:37.800]   I'm sure that the new iPhones are going cameras are going to be optimized to make sure they work really really well with ARKit
[00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:44.680]   But apples genius is that they're not doing it like project tango with google where you don't have to have a special phone
[00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:47.720]   You can developers are using whatever hardware they happen to have right now
[00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:49.480]   And that works great
[00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:53.320]   But the other thing is that i'm not i'm seeing a lot of demos like this
[00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:58.920]   Once developers have created something that works great and they're not apt to show
[00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:05.160]   If this is if whatever the current state of this makeup generating app is
[00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:08.040]   They are going to show it off working fine
[00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:13.960]   They're not going to show off. Oh and by the way here the 31 times during the when we're trying to capture video from this demo
[00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:17.960]   That the makeup the the lips were a little bit to the left a little little bit to the right
[00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:23.080]   Or i'm not going to show you the footage we shot when it was someone who has thinner lips or thicker lips
[00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:28.280]   Where was tracking it properly? We're seeing demos of things working. We're not seeing demos of things failing
[00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:33.000]   So it's it's going to be i'm really really excited by everything i've
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:37.960]   Everything i've spoken to every person i've spoken to about ARKit right now all the demos i've seen
[00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:44.440]   And used so far about ARKit, but remember it's still an unproven quantity until let's say four months after it's released
[00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:50.360]   When we not we can't we can't even judge it the first week that the new ios is released
[00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:52.520]   We're going to have to judge it after
[00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:59.320]   We after hundreds of thousands of copies of the software are out in public and developers can get feedback on what's working
[00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:04.120]   What's tripping things up give people one a chance to do a rev or two of this app
[00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:07.160]   That they're making with ARKit to find out how well it works
[00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:10.040]   So i'm terribly excited about what i'm going to see in january or february
[00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:15.080]   I'm also excited about just like imagine like you're commuting and you're in you're in one of the apple buses
[00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:18.280]   And you have your air pods on and you have your ipad in front of you
[00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:23.400]   And you're bored because you've done this commute a hundred times and suddenly there's this app jurassic commute or whatever
[00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:25.480]   And you press a button and your earpiece is going
[00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:31.160]   And you're welcome to jurassic commute and suddenly oh look there's a google bus
[00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:32.840]   Trenasol is love the taste of the google
[00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:34.760]   No, it's just like
[00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:38.600]   Everything changes everything changes because you're you're doing this mixed reality thing and suddenly
[00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:42.440]   You're watching an interactive simulation of dinosaurs rushing down the highway with you
[00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:45.080]   And it just it makes your commute just a little bit better. There's all sort
[00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:48.840]   People hate being bored there's all sorts of things that we can apply this technology. Oh, yeah, I mean
[00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:50.920]   Training
[00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:52.920]   a lot of people don't know that
[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:55.720]   Most of most of the land in boston
[00:30:55.720 --> 00:31:05.640]   Wasn't there until about 1870 something 1880 something when they just because boston was what is now boston was almost entirely marshland
[00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:09.080]   The city of boston is was this tiny that's described as a plum
[00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:15.800]   Just a plum attached to the mainland by one little land bridge that the british quickly took control of and that's how they
[00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:19.480]   Control people going in and at a boston all they to do is pinch off this land bridge
[00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:23.320]   And so after we got the british out we thought why don't we just sort of like
[00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:26.040]   dig
[00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:31.560]   Dirt and rocks from elsewhere and just dump them in the marsh and if we do that for enough decades
[00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:37.640]   We will now have real estate that we can build on and so I sometimes sometimes people ask me about that and i'll
[00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:44.040]   I'll give them links to photos where photos taken from boston common where you see the ocean coming right up to boston
[00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:44.760]   common
[00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:50.200]   And then suddenly you see land and then the next picture you see the public garden that was built on that land
[00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:53.480]   And then you see like one church just beyond the public garden
[00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:58.360]   And then you start to see city blocks far and farther away as the coastline gets pushed farther and farther away
[00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:04.520]   Wouldn't it be wonderful if any time you go into a city like that if you're especially a historic city like philadelphia or boston
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:10.600]   Uh, you could just simply hold up your phone and just from any spot and say well here is what this looked like 50 years ago
[00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:13.400]   100 years ago 150 years ago 200 years ago
[00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:19.480]   That's that that's from as as good as these demos are as good as apple's promotion of this is
[00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:22.040]   This is the prime example of
[00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:26.760]   Letting the public find their own version of awesome in this feature
[00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:32.440]   It's not going to be whatever apple cooks into it. It's going to be a potential that developers see and it's going to be
[00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:38.920]   A true testament to here's the crazy ones the ones that just wouldn't apple would never have predicted in a million years
[00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:42.600]   Anybody would use a arkett for this and now they're trying to
[00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:51.880]   They're trying to send this man or woman an offer package desperately because they need to bring this this this warped twisted wonderful beautiful brain inside kupertino
[00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:57.560]   That's the thing i'm most excited about is that if you have someone out who is let's say an expert at historical modeling
[00:32:57.560 --> 00:32:59.880]   They can just use our arkett to make it a reality
[00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:03.560]   They don't also have to go and build this entire ar tracking and rendering engine
[00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:09.720]   They can do what they do well and let apple handle the heavy lifting through the frameworks and that just it opens all these different developers
[00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:11.480]   Up to this opportunity
[00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:15.800]   All right, let's take a break when we come back. I have a bunch of images of iphone eight
[00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:17.720]   Uh-oh
[00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:19.720]   And we're gonna play a game
[00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:23.960]   I want you guys if it sounds if it looks right and you think it's true go ding ding ding
[00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:26.360]   If you think it's bogus you go
[00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:28.680]   Okay, we're gonna play
[00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:31.160]   I don't I don't have a buzzer to give you you just have to do with your voice
[00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:36.680]   Uh, we're gonna play that game when we return in just a second. I show today brought to you by the tracker
[00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:38.440]   a
[00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:41.480]   Lovely little device that helps you find
[00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:46.360]   The your most valued possessions. We all spend a lot of time looking for stuff
[00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:51.960]   We know we have but we have misplaced keys for me is number one. Where are my keys?
[00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:54.200]   It's kind of the refrain every morning. Where are my keys?
[00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:58.680]   Wallet number two. Well, it used to be now that I have the tracker in both
[00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:02.600]   Tracker is a bluetooth device about the size of a quarter actually have the
[00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:08.200]   Tracker bravo looks almost looks like a quarter. It's anodized aluminum a little bit lighter actually a lot lighter
[00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:15.240]   Uh, and then now they have the tracker pixel, which is even smaller and lighter and that has leds or it on it and a ring
[00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:19.800]   And and that's handy because if you leave your key like your keys fella under the couch
[00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:23.800]   The lights really help you find it plus the loud noise that comes out of it
[00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:27.720]   You can trigger that noise from your phone you pair it to your phone via bluetooth
[00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:31.160]   There's a button on the tracker you push if you lose your phone
[00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:37.000]   The tracker goes you press that button and the tracker makes the phone even if it's silenced go. Hey, I'm over here
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.160]   Well, it plays a song or whatever you choose
[00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:43.640]   It also has the best crowd sourced network in the world
[00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:47.960]   The largest crowd location network in the world with more than four and a half million
[00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:50.200]   Trackers out there
[00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:54.840]   No matter where your device is when somebody running the tracker software walks by it
[00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:57.160]   It'll ping your map
[00:34:57.160 --> 00:35:00.280]   And you'll see where your thing is even if somebody's taken it and moved it
[00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:04.120]   I put trackers on my bicycle. So if somebody steals my bike I can find out where it is
[00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:06.840]   Put it in your luggage. You never lose
[00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:09.640]   Especially hand luggage ever again
[00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:14.440]   And tracker's 30-day money back guarantee means you've got nothing to lose get it
[00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:18.920]   Keys wallets even your car and your pets
[00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:22.360]   It's kind of like find my iPhone for everything you own
[00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:25.720]   The tracker and the all-new tracker pixel
[00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:32.760]   Go there right now check it out t h e t r a c k r dot com the tracker dot com
[00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:36.840]   and load up your cart with all the devices you want and
[00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:39.400]   Take 20 percent off that order
[00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:47.080]   With a promo code mac break tell your friends to 20 percent off any order with the offer code mac break at the tracker
[00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:52.280]   Dot com t h e t r a c k r they're over 5 million devices ship now
[00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:55.160]   So I should update that say 5 million
[00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:58.120]   5 million
[00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:00.360]   5 million
[00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:02.600]   All right, you ready to play our little game
[00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:06.760]   The bunch of leaks on slash leaks from a guy
[00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:08.920]   named
[00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:12.280]   Uh the leaker. No, no, they're different names the leaker
[00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:15.720]   uh, this one has a trust score quite high. This is the
[00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:18.200]   iPhone 8
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:23.000]   Display panel before you or ding ding ding i'll show you some other images
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:27.720]   I think this looks a little fakey fake would be this would be easy to fake wouldn't it?
[00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:30.120]   What do you think?
[00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:31.160]   Um
[00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:33.160]   Not a many time. You don't know how easy it be
[00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:38.440]   Um also there are a couple of android phones that are using that style believe it or not so
[00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:44.840]   And i'm not i'm not saying i'm saying i'm unwilling to commit at this juncture
[00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:50.040]   It is close to it is close to what iphone it looks like from my understanding this i don't know if those are actual panels
[00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:54.360]   They're not it's it's what i'm expecting this from leek spinner is a camera and
[00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:56.360]   Oh
[00:36:56.360 --> 00:37:01.800]   Some apple watch band sensing module. No, it's not you think everything's an apple watch band
[00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:05.160]   I know i was gonna buy it leo is it the 3d sensing module
[00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:07.720]   Form an iphone 8
[00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:10.600]   Leek spinner is 78 accurate
[00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:13.880]   That's beyond my expertise sadly
[00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:18.040]   I was hoping for a lot of funny sounds on this one all right all right all right
[00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:20.040]   All right
[00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:26.520]   How about the ole display assembly
[00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:31.480]   With some same one same one that just put glue some stuff on it
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:36.120]   with the uh light lightning and power flex cables
[00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:38.520]   Well, it's probably compatible with what i was
[00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:41.960]   Somebody's got a bell nice handy
[00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:48.040]   Well, I just i'm just gonna say that that that tabletop that looks like a sort of woodgrain that johnny i would
[00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:51.960]   So definitely on
[00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:57.000]   All right, you see the the futility of all this how about the a 11
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:05.880]   I mean it's clearly well that's almost impossible. It's a blurry shot of an a 11. It could be a piece of cardboard
[00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:09.000]   who knows what that is uh, let's see uh the
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.960]   wireless charging accessory
[00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:15.160]   Well, I mean well
[00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:17.720]   Yeah, uh
[00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:20.680]   Could be a few more won't see that part of it. Yeah, I don't know now
[00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:25.720]   It's not it's not inconceivable that these things are leaking out because we are probably in production right now
[00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:30.360]   Actually, actually what we could what we could do the giveaway would be if we take a look at that surface and see that
[00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:35.560]   Even though the user is never going to see it that it's been painted just as well as the side of the iphone that people will see
[00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:39.080]   All right, this I don't trust at all side by side images
[00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:41.640]   of
[00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:43.640]   Mm-hmm
[00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:51.880]   Dump bump i'm guessing i'm guessing no although the mock up all the mockups i've seen of the next generation iphone have had the vertical
[00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:54.440]   camera slot
[00:38:54.440 --> 00:39:00.280]   As opposed to the horizontal camera slot that seems a fakey fake this one
[00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:03.320]   But who knows who knows
[00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:07.000]   Uh hands on the iphone. Oh, we already saw that one. Let's see
[00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:12.040]   This is all from slash leaks. They have some good stuff. Here's a here's a
[00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:16.280]   Blush gold yeah blush gold copper gold
[00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:22.280]   Now, why are they not willing to say bronze? That's clearly what we would call bronze before
[00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:28.680]   Rose gold was kind of like pink, but they didn't say well rose there was there was such a thing as rose gold
[00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:30.920]   It's has to be sort of a much that wash
[00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:37.240]   Right, it's a gold bronze though is bronze. We know what bronze is we've we've there we named an entire age after bronze
[00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:41.960]   We people have been killed with bronze tools. They are the west they saw with bronze cream
[00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:44.920]   Here the three
[00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:49.240]   The there's this is the copper gold, you know, we're seeing enough of these
[00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:52.600]   Just a bronze gold bronze gold
[00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:56.600]   Um, they tongue jet black and again look at the sensor
[00:39:56.600 --> 00:40:01.400]   But i should point out there is a brisk market for fake iphones in china
[00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:03.560]   I get them every year
[00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:06.920]   And these could easily be not actual iphones
[00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:11.480]   But the mock-ups or the fakes that somebody's making and you know to sell
[00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:16.040]   See these don't match now. They're all vertical, but I guess well, maybe these are all the new iphone
[00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:21.560]   In bronze gold black, but any but this is kind of anybody can make that it's it's it's really hard to go
[00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:25.320]   We're we're we're almost at the last week of august right now
[00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:31.240]   This is this is the time at which if we're if we're ever expecting to see genuine
[00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:37.640]   Unauthorized photos in advance. This is the time we would see it because you just can't too many people are
[00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:39.560]   Are in on at this point now
[00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:42.360]   You can't trust every it's like reading the script of the next star wars movie
[00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:46.680]   If you look at all these and then you go to the event and you say boring is because you looked at all these right?
[00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:52.040]   Yeah, or it's like I consider it like i'm gonna i'm gonna bit torrent an episode of game of thrones
[00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:54.840]   That's going to air in five days. It's like
[00:40:54.840 --> 00:41:01.880]   Okay, I mean if like what's the what's the what's the harm in waiting five days to see?
[00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:05.640]   It easy and with finished effects, right? Yeah, it's
[00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:10.920]   This I it's like this. I'm gonna say ding ding ding ding this is an x-ray
[00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:17.960]   Yeah, thank you, Andy. This is a picture of a windows xp screen. So that I give it some credibility
[00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:23.640]   Just for that right. This is their but also explain how these photos are being leaked out
[00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:27.480]   And by the way, I should point out that there that the
[00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:33.320]   rounded corner blob in the back of this x-ray looks a lot like that wireless charging module we saw
[00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:35.480]   earlier
[00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:38.760]   So I this kind of this I this looks pretty credible. This is a
[00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:41.800]   purportedly an x-ray picture of
[00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:46.600]   The iPhone it's from an iPhone that I suddenly followed a thumbtack and they were worried that it would be
[00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:51.240]   Well, but this is part of the test stage the evt stage right is that they uh
[00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:56.920]   Yeah, there was a video this morning on reddit where someone was testing the apple logo being a fingerprint reader on the back of an
[00:41:56.920 --> 00:42:00.680]   iPhone 8 and people were losing their mind. It's a silly season. Let's yeah
[00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:06.120]   It's this is the that time of year. Let's talk a little bit about that fingerprint reader
[00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:09.160]   um actually before well
[00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:12.600]   Do we have on I see if we have any rumors?
[00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:18.680]   That's that's dopey. I think it's gone. You think you guys agree. It's gonna be gone. I think it's gonna be gone in the next one
[00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:26.040]   I think you can deal with it. I think there's I think there's going to be at least a iphone that doesn't have it. Yeah. Yes
[00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:33.640]   Or it could have under the screen fingerprint technology is just not working consistently enough of them to talk about it and it gets enabled in a future update
[00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:35.720]   Oh, that's interesting
[00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:41.640]   I don't know how far along they got with it. Yeah, I'd be surprised if it were something that
[00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:45.080]   I'd be surprised if the if the
[00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:50.600]   Sensor were there but the firmware or the the software isn't ready yet
[00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:53.240]   And so they leave it disabled until there's a surprise update
[00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:59.320]   I'd be more inclined to think that they've got plan A and plan B and as soon as the
[00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:04.040]   The incredibly difficult and incredibly revolutionary plan A didn't
[00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:10.280]   Prove to be completely reliable. They went immediately to plan B. I don't think I I'm not sure that they would do it that way
[00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:13.480]   It's not as easy as like implementing a new version of bluetooth
[00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:19.480]   It's I have a hard time believing that that would work, but again, we're all just guessing at this point. Yeah
[00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:25.160]   What happens idea all the time you have uh, iOS 11 on your phone yet either of you
[00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:31.640]   Yes, I I put on my uh, I I pad pro and by the way, it works great in the beta six wdc
[00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:36.600]   I'm gonna go to reputation to maintain when you tap your home button five times
[00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:38.440]   Yes
[00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:41.960]   It uh, it says would you like me a call 911 right?
[00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:44.360]   Do it right now. Yeah
[00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:46.520]   That's the emergency and that by the that's a nice feature
[00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:48.200]   Yes
[00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:52.200]   This way. Yeah, and then it disables touch ID
[00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:54.200]   Yeah
[00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:57.720]   That's it's completely intentional. Why is that intentional?
[00:43:57.720 --> 00:44:00.120]   Uh because they wanted them
[00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:04.280]   Previously there there are times now and people were very quick to call it a cop button, but that's not it at all
[00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:10.280]   There are times now when you're going to be in a situation where you want to disable biometrics because let's say you're walking down a dark alley
[00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:13.400]   Or you're crossing a border into a region that you don't think is safe
[00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:16.440]   Uh, or you know, you're you you have an encounter at night
[00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:19.000]   You don't necessarily trust the person you're falling asleep next to
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:24.840]   Um, and you just you want to make sure that people can't access your phone biometrically and previously you had to reboot it
[00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:26.440]   Which is a little bit cumbersome?
[00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:31.400]   Uh, this just very quickly very quickly lets you put it into a secure state
[00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:35.640]   And it's really well thought out too like if you actually go through with the with the sos message
[00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:41.000]   It doesn't disable touch IDH. It's just as able as it long enough for that screen to come up and and make sure that
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:45.240]   It's the power button not the home button, right? I miss the power, but yeah the power button
[00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:49.080]   So don't be tapping your power your home button five times. Hope and something's going to happen
[00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:51.160]   That actually just launches accessibility
[00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:54.680]   Uh, so five times on the home button which is pretty imperceptible
[00:44:54.680 --> 00:44:59.560]   And then if uh law enforcement says can you unlock your phone you you say?
[00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:00.760]   I
[00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:01.560]   No
[00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:05.400]   You you need you have to get the password out of me and the presumption is
[00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:10.840]   That at least in the us the password is protected in a way that the fingerprint is not
[00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:15.640]   Courts have long held that you can well you get fingerprint when you get arrested
[00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:18.680]   Um that you know that the police can take your fingerprint
[00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:24.360]   But how sad is it that many of us are more concerned about law enforcement privacy invasions and we are about criminal behavior
[00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:27.160]   It's kind of bogus to be honest with you. I don't I don't you know
[00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:29.080]   I don't think it happens very often at all
[00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:33.960]   We were all worried about this that somehow you know this would happen you enter the united states a lot
[00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:35.560]   Do you what what kind of treatment do you get by?
[00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:37.560]   I use nexus so I
[00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:43.640]   Volent in order to have an easier uh transit between the two I voluntarily gave both retina scans and fingerprint scans
[00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:47.320]   So going into the us they want fingerprints and coming back into Canada. They want a retina scan
[00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:50.680]   And but not and you've never been hassled otherwise
[00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:55.800]   I mean it depends there are times when there's heightened security and then they ask you a lot more questions
[00:45:55.800 --> 00:46:01.080]   Or they disable the nexus and they make you go through the the regular way if they ever asked you for your phone
[00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:04.360]   No, I never asked you for social
[00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:07.160]   Network passwords or no
[00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:13.160]   I see I just also have not very often. I'm super like I'm going in and out there a day with not a day with not a lot of people like us
[00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:15.080]   It doesn't happen very often to people like us
[00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:21.800]   Actually, it's a bike a bike guy named rene richy is not liable to be hassled by I don't know he looks kind of dangerous and
[00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:24.600]   Not carrying bags to me seems like you're more dangerous
[00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:28.600]   Because no so I did I had this for a while when I was transiting like it all
[00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:34.200]   They asked me what you do for a living and previously I was in web development and that would trigger every time I get moved into another room
[00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:38.520]   And interrogated it because really thought I was going to work illegally in the u.s. Oh, they were more worried about that
[00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:46.120]   Yeah, absolutely, but and especially if I didn't shave they were just like, okay, if he get over there until I had that problem going into Canada
[00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:51.960]   Because if you if they think you're going to make money and can't into Canada same problem. They don't want you to do that
[00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:56.280]   So what I was always told is don't don't tell them you're making any money
[00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:59.320]   You're making a television appearance for free
[00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:06.680]   But if I said I am going to go up there's a paid host. It was problematic. I actually had to get a letter and a visa and
[00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:08.680]   I can't they hire a comedian host
[00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:13.400]   Precisely and so what people into tech industry and maybe I shouldn't be saying that people in tech industry in canada
[00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:16.280]   I've learned to do is say that you're going down there to train your american replacement
[00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:19.160]   And then they're super happy to let you in
[00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:25.640]   Okay, good to know I wish I was joking
[00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:31.160]   I was told also never say you're a journalist, but I you know, I don't I always say I'm a journalist. That's okay
[00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:38.520]   I'm gonna celebrate it. All right. We've got a big question here and we talked a little bit about an iOS today
[00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:40.200]   I bet you a
[00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:44.120]   Steve Gibson will talk a little bit about it on a security now later in the day
[00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:52.440]   You know where I'm going with this we're gonna take a little break and then talk about the hacker who says I have decrypted apples secure on clave
[00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:54.600]   is that
[00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:56.600]   problematic
[00:47:56.600 --> 00:48:01.480]   And meanwhile, let's watch an ad from Volvo. I don't know why this is playing on my screen. Thank you
[00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:06.200]   Alio, I just lost electricity, but I have about 45 minutes of backup. You're kidding back
[00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:10.200]   We're having a major storm here and it just everything went out, but I have about 45 minutes of all right
[00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:15.160]   All right. We're gonna move fast here because we need to have Renee's comment on this our show
[00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:17.560]   Yikes
[00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:21.160]   Thank you. You have big battery backup if you get 45 of them. Yeah, wow
[00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:26.120]   Our show today brought to you by cap terra so many times people say you're the tech guy
[00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:30.680]   You're a geek. You should know I have a medical office. What's the best software? I go. I don't know
[00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:34.360]   I am a web designer. What's the best? I don't know
[00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:37.320]   Now I have somewhere I can send them cap terra
[00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:40.360]   t-e-r-r-a
[00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:43.720]   Dot com cap terra is a totally free
[00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:50.920]   Software comparison site for business software and I don't care what business any business
[00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:56.760]   Are you running a church a construction site? Are you doing customer relationship management or e-commerce?
[00:48:56.760 --> 00:49:02.840]   Do you need help with your help desk or do you want to learn how to run a learning management system?
[00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:06.680]   Maybe you're a maintenance worker and you just can't maintain your software
[00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:11.400]   If you go right now to cap terra dot com slash mac break you will find
[00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:21.240]   400 categories of business software to choose from in almost every category hundreds of apps and the information you need to
[00:49:21.320 --> 00:49:23.960]   Choose the right one. Let's say let's say I need
[00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:27.720]   maintenance management. I don't even know what maintenance management is
[00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:31.800]   But let's say I need it go show my screen. There you go
[00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:35.960]   So I just clicked that category now of course immediately I get look at all these apps
[00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:41.080]   Somebody knows what maintenance management is there's hundreds of apps. Well, that's each by the way each
[00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:46.280]   Entry has a description and so forth, but that's not let's make it a little easier. Let's narrow it down
[00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:52.040]   Let's say we only want to see by the way. There's more than 200,000 reviews by real users on this site
[00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:54.280]   so we're gonna narrow it down to only
[00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:58.200]   Only the the apps that have four or more stars
[00:49:58.200 --> 00:49:59.960]   And how many users?
[00:49:59.960 --> 00:50:03.960]   Well, there's only two of us in the department to nine of us or whatever you pick the number of users
[00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:08.600]   Do you want this to be web based or do you want it to be installed in your hard drive?
[00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:15.000]   Let's run a web based one. That's easy. What do you need key in lock management? Sure planning calendar? Yeah preventative maintenance calendar
[00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:19.800]   Purchasing scheduling click the features you want press the filter button
[00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:23.960]   And now you've narrowed it down to just those apps that do exactly what you want
[00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:25.640]   Take a look at them
[00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:30.680]   click the add to compare button to add up to four of them to a comparison chart
[00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:34.280]   And now you can really drill down
[00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:40.920]   And find just oh, how did you hear about it? Oh on a podcast. Oh, oh, oh Mac break
[00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:45.320]   That's what you should do if they ask you. That's all we ask. It's free in every other respect
[00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:50.760]   So look at i've got a comparison chart that says, you know, exactly how much it costs
[00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:55.720]   What it's you know what it runs on what its features are screen shots
[00:50:55.720 --> 00:51:00.520]   But here's the thing that's most useful customer reviews and ratings
[00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:05.400]   You're going to love this. There's no reason to google it to ask somebody
[00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:11.160]   Just go to keptterra.com/macbreak. This is the smartest way to find business software
[00:51:11.720 --> 00:51:15.960]   Millions of people use keptterra every month and i'm i'm i'm on it emphasizes
[00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:17.960]   Not only is it free
[00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:20.840]   You don't give them your email address. You don't have to sign up
[00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:26.600]   It's just a directory of great software with great reviews by people just like you
[00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:31.560]   keptterra if you're looking for business software capterra.com
[00:51:31.560 --> 00:51:38.120]   slash mac break and if the little pop-up comes up as it did for me and they say well how'd you hear about us
[00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:41.800]   You say podcast and mac break right right yes, yes
[00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:47.560]   All right rene richy power almost out. Let's see if we can get this in under the wire
[00:51:47.560 --> 00:51:53.800]   And off again twice so far so my fingers are more. Well, it's good. You have it's actually really good. You have upc's. Yeah, upc
[00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:55.720]   um
[00:51:55.720 --> 00:51:57.240]   Guy named zirib
[00:51:57.240 --> 00:52:00.920]   Has released what he claims to be the decryption key
[00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:04.520]   for apples secure enclave
[00:52:07.080 --> 00:52:11.480]   Well, so the decryption not for the so apple's got a secure encryption processor a sep
[00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:17.720]   And this isn't the key for the sep this is the key for the obfuscation layer around the sep
[00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:22.120]   And the way i tried to describe it is if you imagine apple has this bank vault
[00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:27.160]   They've got a black curtain in front of it so that you can't tell what kind of vault it is and that makes it just much
[00:52:27.160 --> 00:52:31.400]   A little bit harder. There's always security through obscurity is generally derided
[00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:37.000]   But it's it's it's part of a good defense in depth which means you have multi layer multiple layers to your security and one
[00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:42.120]   Of the layers they had was this obfuscation this wrapper around it that made it heart made it impossible for anyone
[00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:46.840]   To see what was going on in the sep and to start poking around in it and he found the key to that
[00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:49.240]   So he's been able to pull off this curtain for example
[00:52:49.240 --> 00:52:55.320]   And now you can see the actual sep none of the security is all still there. No user data was compromised as far as we know
[00:52:55.320 --> 00:53:02.680]   No one's breached it. It's just now he and you know white hat and black hat hacker is alike can actually see what the sep is
[00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:06.040]   Well, but they can see the firmware too, right? And it means they can start to
[00:53:06.040 --> 00:53:10.200]   Bank and they can hack on it. Yeah before it was off you so yeah
[00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:14.920]   So it was obfuscated before now it's revealed and if
[00:53:14.920 --> 00:53:18.680]   I can bet there are hundreds if not thousands of hackers
[00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:24.840]   Looking at it trying to find flaws in it and the reason is there's a lot of money to be made there, right?
[00:53:24.840 --> 00:53:31.880]   Well, it's and it's not necessarily a bad thing of if we if he was able to crack through this
[00:53:32.680 --> 00:53:34.680]   Peel that curtain behind
[00:53:34.680 --> 00:53:39.560]   Peel back that curtain. That's not to say that's other people have not done it previously
[00:53:39.560 --> 00:53:44.600]   But just simply regarded that information as way too valuable to share with anybody so
[00:53:44.600 --> 00:53:53.320]   If it exposes the if it exposes another layer to let the good hackers look for vulnerabilities that apple hasn't found yet
[00:53:53.320 --> 00:53:55.640]   That's not necessarily a bad thing
[00:53:55.640 --> 00:54:01.720]   But it's nothing nothing for anybody to worry about as yet, but it's certainly a landmark data point
[00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:08.600]   Yeah, this is what zerob the checker says the fact that the by the way the secure enclave is where touch ID goes
[00:54:08.600 --> 00:54:13.480]   It's where passwords are stored. It's where all the secret stuff is stored in a secure enclave
[00:54:13.480 --> 00:54:15.480]   So that's separate from the rest of the operating system
[00:54:15.480 --> 00:54:19.400]   It's not it's not it's not the it's not the your secret stuff that could be compromised
[00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:24.360]   It's the code that apple put together to keep the stuff secret that could have been exposed
[00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:28.680]   Which means that if there is a problem in there that can be exploited now
[00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:34.440]   It's one step easier for someone to find that problem. Here's what zerob says the fact that the sep was hidden behind a key
[00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:40.120]   Worries me is apple not confident enough to push the secure enclave
[00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:43.640]   Decrypted as they did with kernals past ios 10
[00:54:43.640 --> 00:54:49.640]   Yes, that's I mean that's a false equivalency the reason they decrypted it was it was a performance enhancement
[00:54:49.640 --> 00:54:54.200]   They they found out that the act of decrypting it was doing just enough to slow down the processes
[00:54:54.200 --> 00:54:55.640]   They wanted they left it decrypted
[00:54:55.640 --> 00:55:00.520]   They thought there was no threat to user data because it didn't touch any user data and it was an advantage to performance
[00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:03.800]   So for them it was a net win where this again is at defense in depth
[00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:07.560]   I mean paradise island has that cloaking device and if you get through that cloaking device
[00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:10.360]   You still got to fight the amazon's and and you know busting to the castle
[00:55:10.360 --> 00:55:12.760]   But that cloaking device stops you from even having to do that
[00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:18.360]   And this is same way you might have a gate before you get to the alarm before you get to the front door before you get to all these other things
[00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:21.160]   It was just one more layer of protection. So now
[00:55:22.520 --> 00:55:27.720]   People will be analyzing the firmware trying to find holes in it. Zareb says I think public scrutiny will add
[00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:31.400]   To the security of the secure enclave in the long run
[00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:37.400]   Because people will be analyzing it and trying to find holes and as they do and you know, I have to point out
[00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:40.440]   It's rare that the piece of software that doesn't have flaws
[00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:43.160]   uh, they can be patched and fixed unless
[00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:50.520]   And this is the reason they'll be a gold rush trying to break this stuff down the hacker sells it to the nsa or the cia
[00:55:50.760 --> 00:55:55.160]   Or to the mafia or somebody who doesn't want to disclose it, but instead wants to use it
[00:55:55.160 --> 00:56:02.920]   Uh, and that's the real risk. This is why apple's bug bounty program is so important and really frankly why they should be spending more money not less
[00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:08.440]   They are not coming even close to you know with a hundred thousand dollars to the millions of dollars that
[00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:11.640]   A bad actor will pay or a government will pay for these
[00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:15.000]   Flaws. Yeah, also not not just paying for those flaws
[00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:20.680]   But also paying for the secrecy of these flaws because remember that if there's if there's a vending machine
[00:56:20.760 --> 00:56:25.000]   Somewhere on campus that will give you three cokes for one dollar instead of one coke for a dollar
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:28.280]   You don't want to tell anybody that exists or else they'll fix that machine
[00:56:28.280 --> 00:56:31.480]   So whenever you get a security problem with the device
[00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:37.880]   That's your if my job is to get into people's phones. I want to keep that flaw intact
[00:56:37.880 --> 00:56:41.480]   So I don't I don't want to sell it to anybody. I don't want it to give it away to anybody
[00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:43.000]   I certainly don't want to claim
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:48.120]   essentially a tesla s sticker price for uh for it because I could that's basically
[00:56:48.760 --> 00:56:52.920]   That's that's giving away my ability to charge people 300 000 a shot
[00:56:52.920 --> 00:56:56.760]   To get into things and not have to tell anybody how I was doing it
[00:56:56.760 --> 00:56:59.160]   So it's a it's a very very serious problem
[00:56:59.160 --> 00:57:04.120]   And I but I tend to think that the more people know about this flaw the more
[00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:08.520]   The greater the chance that one of the good hackers is going to expose it in such a way
[00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:12.360]   That either people are warned the hell off of trusting this or
[00:57:12.360 --> 00:57:16.280]   The manufacturer is in a position to really not only fix it
[00:57:16.280 --> 00:57:19.560]   But also make sure it's damn fixed and make sure everybody knows it's fixed
[00:57:19.560 --> 00:57:24.360]   The article in tech republic goes on to say that apple has no intention of fixing this
[00:57:24.360 --> 00:57:27.560]   That would be a big deal for apple to do because they would have to
[00:57:27.560 --> 00:57:32.520]   Change the encryption key in in all I mean it just is not going to happen
[00:57:32.520 --> 00:57:38.120]   They'll do a different key in next generation iPhones. I'm sure they'll have a next generation set
[00:57:38.120 --> 00:57:42.040]   I wasn't a big fan of tech tech republic's article on this. I thought the they they fixed it
[00:57:42.040 --> 00:57:44.120]   They they kept fixing it throughout the day, but
[00:57:44.440 --> 00:57:47.880]   It kind of veered towards the wrong story for most of it
[00:57:47.880 --> 00:57:51.240]   I think the thing it's it's it's accurate now, which is
[00:57:51.240 --> 00:57:56.200]   The secure enclave processor handles password touch ID encryption and decryption
[00:57:56.200 --> 00:58:01.160]   It doesn't release any user data or information at all
[00:58:01.160 --> 00:58:07.320]   Yep, but it does give bad guys the opportunity now to start looking at how the secure enclave processor works
[00:58:07.320 --> 00:58:10.840]   And perhaps find holes in it. But as as of right now
[00:58:12.360 --> 00:58:17.560]   It we don't know of any holes that have been apple keeps patching stuff and there'll be a secure enclave of two or three or whatever number
[00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:19.720]   They're on next I mean it's a cat and mouse game
[00:58:19.720 --> 00:58:26.600]   Would government use this could it be a value to the government to get into your phone for instance to
[00:58:26.600 --> 00:58:29.320]   unlock a locked iPhone
[00:58:29.320 --> 00:58:32.200]   I mean usually you need multiple exploits now, right?
[00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:35.160]   Like you need you need what gets you on the device you need what escalates your privilege
[00:58:35.160 --> 00:58:40.120]   You need what releases the right now is a token. It releases a yes or no token if you're if you're authenticated
[00:58:40.120 --> 00:58:45.480]   It's right. It's it's a bunch of stuff they need to do my my understanding is that this alone wouldn't do it
[00:58:45.480 --> 00:58:50.200]   The only the most the greatest use you could get would be to use this
[00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:56.520]   Use the information side of the secure enclave to create a ghost device that could pretend to be
[00:58:56.520 --> 00:58:59.640]   authentication, but it's not it wouldn't be
[00:58:59.640 --> 00:59:05.880]   There are other techniques that would be way way easier than that as far as my knowledge of this system goes
[00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:10.760]   It's too late now, but if you found a hidden apple page
[00:59:10.760 --> 00:59:14.440]   You could get a job
[00:59:14.440 --> 00:59:19.240]   This apple page was hidden in a on a web page where was it hidden?
[00:59:19.240 --> 00:59:22.520]   That's just it wasn't it wasn't really hidden. It was just
[00:59:22.520 --> 00:59:27.480]   There's if you do if you run any utility that basically does web traces that basically says here
[00:59:27.480 --> 00:59:31.320]   Here are the URLs that are being requested from the software that's on your machine
[00:59:31.320 --> 00:59:32.920]   uh
[00:59:32.920 --> 00:59:37.080]   There are a lot of machines that apple uses for iCloud for basically all of its services
[00:59:37.080 --> 00:59:42.760]   And so if you just say oh, I wonder what blah blah blah blah blah for dot apple dot whatever
[00:59:42.760 --> 00:59:48.360]   Funny let's cut that out. Let's paste it into a let's open that URL and that's literally the front page
[00:59:48.360 --> 00:59:52.120]   So it's not like this wasn't matthew broader at getting into ctech
[00:59:52.120 --> 00:59:59.480]   Astronomer anything like that. It was pretty easy. It's pretty cool. The guy who had discovered his equitica used a tool called burp
[00:59:59.960 --> 01:00:05.000]   suite a traffic analyzer intercept data between several iphone apps to see what kind of
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:12.120]   Personal data was being sent along to advertisers. That's something that's widely done with wire shark and other analyzers as well
[01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:17.000]   Among the stream of connections to analytics sites and advertisers used to track a user's app consumption
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:25.480]   There were several outbound connections to an apple server which the company uses to host iCloud data such as customers photos and videos
[01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:32.280]   And he was just smart enough to say hmm. I wonder what this us east one dot blob store dot apple dot com points to
[01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:37.880]   And it pointed to an ASCII page with a job offer. Hey there. You found us
[01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:42.200]   We're looking for a talented engineer to develop a critical infrastructure component
[01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:45.400]   That is to be a key part of the apple apple ecosystem
[01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:52.280]   How critical data capacity exabytes servers tens of thousands disks millions
[01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:55.080]   So it's a network engineer a
[01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:57.080]   Not hard to imagine
[01:00:57.080 --> 01:01:03.960]   Uh, wow, I think that's actually really clever. I wonder how many companies are doing things like that
[01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:10.120]   You know, I just think it's great. Yeah, like the like the last starfighter like greetings starfighter
[01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:14.280]   Then Robert Preston shows up takes into spaceship literally
[01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:17.000]   Yep, and I love it that has this ASCII apple
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:20.840]   And by the way the letter mostly the letters are emms capital
[01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:24.680]   So good is that funny?
[01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:28.280]   That is really cool. What do you do you make anything of that job listing?
[01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:30.920]   Uh, does it mean anything particular to any either of you?
[01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:38.120]   No, I mean anything network engineer. Yeah, good people higher level high level network architect really might be more
[01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:43.160]   Instead of a lousy old journalist, sorry
[01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:47.560]   Did you see will traffic story about acuweather along the lines of packets sniffing? No
[01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:51.160]   So acuweather is a weather app and will traffic
[01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:55.880]   Uh, you know, he's he was chronic. He was a jailbreaker and now he's doing a lot of security analysis for apps
[01:01:55.880 --> 01:02:00.680]   And he found that acuweather was sending your location data to a data uh vending company
[01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:07.160]   Every few hours are we surprised come on. This is a free program. Are you you surprised?
[01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:13.880]   And what I guess disclosure. Yeah, they should probably say but i'm sure somewhere it says your locations being shared, right?
[01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:18.040]   Oh, even when location sharing is off. Yeah
[01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:20.200]   That was the the rub. Oh
[01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:22.440]   Never mind
[01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:24.440]   Yeah, you probably shouldn't do that
[01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:30.520]   Yes, but I mean come on. I mean, we know that most of most of the free apps leak some sort of information about you
[01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:33.000]   Well, he's got a whole program now where he keeps analyzing apps
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.720]   Or this is kind of stuff and reporting and then at least you can make an informed decision
[01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:39.880]   If acuweather is valuable enough for us for you that you don't care or if you do care you can pick another weather app
[01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:42.520]   Where is that page?
[01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:45.000]   Uh, it's a it's a program i'll find it for you
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:49.720]   But it's a it's a service that he set up that just keeps scanning apps for what's this example bad ssl?
[01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:51.960]   What's will's hacker name again?
[01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:53.480]   at chronic on twitter
[01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:54.920]   at chronic
[01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:56.680]   verified.lee
[01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:59.880]   verified.lee. Oh, I know why yeah, I know that page
[01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:04.760]   V-er i-f
[01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:07.320]   Y dot l y or vr
[01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:13.880]   Dot l y yeah, it's v-er i-f y dot l y. There's not much up there right now. Okay, but he's doing a lot of good
[01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:17.160]   Okay allows you to scan the binary code of an iOS application
[01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:20.200]   To produce a human readable report. Oh, this looks good
[01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:25.160]   Yeah, report detailing all detected common security issues and a breakdown
[01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:27.560]   So would you have to jailbreak to use this?
[01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:33.800]   He was providing a lot of information from it, but i'm not sure what his actual model is for this yet
[01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:37.720]   Pre- well, let's see what the pricing is
[01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:40.280]   Yeah
[01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:44.360]   If you have to ask you can't afford it pricing no, it's a hundred bucks a month
[01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:46.360]   Yeah
[01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:50.440]   But I don't think this is this is you know end user facing no I think there's more
[01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:54.360]   Yeah, well, that's a good thank you for that. It's a good service. Yeah
[01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:57.320]   And I did not did not know
[01:03:57.320 --> 01:04:03.800]   And he's very good if you follow him on twitter. He's not sensational at all a lot of times the security stories come out and he says no stop panic
[01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:08.280]   There's no no relationship between these things or there's how do you spell his candle?
[01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:11.800]   H R O N I C. Oh
[01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:15.320]   accurately
[01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:17.960]   There he is
[01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:20.120]   Here and he just published a
[01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:26.840]   Article called 76 popular apps confirmed vulnerable to silent interception of TLS protected data yikes
[01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:31.800]   Yeah, no, it's good stuff. It's great to get like a lot of attention to this following him
[01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:37.240]   And then I always love it when you follow somebody like that you always get some great suggestions for other people
[01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:44.600]   That might be a handy to follow stiff and ester is the opposite. He's also brilliant, but he is so pessimistic. He's gloomy
[01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:50.920]   Yeah, he's like all the seppas got the seppas. You know, we don't know now. Maybe they got the whole thing and the world is ending
[01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:53.240]   It's all over. It's all over
[01:04:53.240 --> 01:04:58.680]   All right, this is good stuff. Good stuff. The info sec world is amazing
[01:04:58.680 --> 01:05:02.680]   I know I love it
[01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:05.560]   Uh
[01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:14.280]   I'm sorry. I was just reading it airpods. Good news. Did you want some? Well now you're only two to three weeks out from your very own
[01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:18.120]   This is it. This has really been an amazing story
[01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:22.920]   And I don't know if the credit goes to the massive success of airpods
[01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:28.680]   I don't see a lot of people walking around with them or just for the incredible difficulty in manufacturing them
[01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:31.400]   Some vendors have them in stock right now
[01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:39.960]   I think it's I think it's reject rate. I think that it's of especially it's a really hard problem to get that battery
[01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:46.200]   Fitting inside there and also making sure that when it's heated up and constructed again. It doesn't
[01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:49.560]   You know pull apart. It doesn't create any problems. I think
[01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:55.320]   They're having a lot of them. Any other company would just ship them all and let let the users test them
[01:05:55.320 --> 01:06:00.360]   I don't yeah, I think I think coming right on the heels of the note seven
[01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:06.920]   Ignition problem when you say oh by the way, we're gonna we have a lot of the battery can put actually inside your ear canal with
[01:06:06.920 --> 01:06:13.000]   Insert it into the thermal exhaust port reading to the core of the reactor so to speak
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.400]   I think that that's a good reason to be super careful
[01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:18.120]   But I believe it to be a question of yields as opposed to
[01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:23.800]   Strictly being able to turn out as many as they could possibly can but it's amazing. It's a hard product to make. Yeah
[01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:28.040]   Yeah, it's amazing that this thing is almost a year old and it's still not
[01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:35.880]   Welcome to store pick it up and get it next day. So I'm sure that I'm sure that various people inside apple are having kittens over this even still
[01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:41.240]   Hey, by the way, thanks to copy in our chat room who says this is nothing new burying
[01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:45.240]   Wann ads in secret parts of web pages the guardian
[01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:52.920]   Has did it in 2015 with some with a javascript based job ad buried on its page. It's aske art as well
[01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:57.800]   I guess that's the the thing to do and this article says that flicker and uber
[01:06:58.440 --> 01:07:02.040]   Have have also as well as google have also done this hiding
[01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:06.440]   Job listings in there. Here's the new york times in pinterest
[01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:13.080]   Uh have a hidden message for developers. This is cool. And it I guess the thing is you got to do it aske or it's no good, right?
[01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:18.120]   Well, you can't I don't I don't I don't think that java
[01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:22.040]   Dotjs file support emoji yet hip chat has done it
[01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:24.840]   nozilla ebay
[01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:26.840]   Pinterest
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:33.720]   Why not it's fantastic. I think it's a great idea if somebody's well so first of all if you're looking for work
[01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:38.200]   And you have some tech skills. I would start looking everywhere for hidden messages
[01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:41.160]   Yep
[01:07:41.160 --> 01:07:43.160]   What a great way to get a job
[01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:45.080]   I found your message
[01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:46.600]   Oh, you're hired
[01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:48.600]   You're hired my friend
[01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:51.320]   So thank you copy for passing that along
[01:07:52.520 --> 01:07:56.840]   And uh, yeah, I love my airpods. I'm very happy with them. I uh, I use them all the time
[01:07:56.840 --> 01:08:00.920]   It's not the sound because a lot of people still bristle at the idea of paying that much for sound
[01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:07.240]   But it's getting the sensors and the accelerometer and the chipsets in there and there's a ton of electronics in those things
[01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:10.120]   Yeah, they don't sound bad. It's not they're not like no
[01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:14.680]   But they're the breakthrough there is not the sound the breakthrough there is getting a lot of stuff stuffed into a tiny little
[01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:17.160]   hearing apparently
[01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:18.600]   yeah
[01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:20.600]   Uh, let's see
[01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:25.000]   We've already talked about the home pod firmware
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:30.760]   I give the keeps getting the yeah, the now the setup process has become obvious
[01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:35.320]   This isn't directly germane, but you know with the with a home pod coming along
[01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:40.040]   Um, I think we've talked before about how this must be scary for sonos
[01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:41.720]   Sonos
[01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:45.400]   Did something strange to me and I bet to you the other day
[01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:51.720]   It said it gave me new privacy settings. Yep in preparation for an update to come
[01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:56.680]   And apparently their new privacy policy. It says if you don't accept it
[01:08:56.680 --> 01:08:59.400]   Your device may not function
[01:08:59.400 --> 01:09:01.160]   in the future
[01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:03.160]   uh, the speculation is
[01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:04.360]   uh
[01:09:04.360 --> 01:09:06.360]   That maybe they're getting ready to
[01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:08.600]   Uh put speech in there
[01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:13.160]   Yeah, it's it's always I mean, I've never been terribly worried about
[01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:18.200]   uh about sonos because all they have to do is just make one car trip up to
[01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:21.240]   Amazon headquarters or one car trip up to google headquarters
[01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:26.280]   And put them both against each other saying we want which we're thinking about putting either
[01:09:26.280 --> 01:09:31.800]   Uh, scallop or putting in google assistant into every single sonos product
[01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:35.960]   What can you do for us and they solve that problem? Not only do they solve that problem
[01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:43.160]   There's a there's a there's a argument to be made they could leapfrog apple not maybe not for the audio quality
[01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:45.800]   But certainly from the uh smart assistant quality
[01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:49.720]   So they don't say I think they don't say you have to agree to it or we're going to turn you off
[01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:54.760]   They just say you won't be able to get further updates and that means that you'll probably get decreasing functionality over time
[01:09:54.760 --> 01:10:00.360]   But then by the way, I spent so much on sonos that I know I do i'm handcuffed
[01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:03.960]   What am I gonna do say no, I don't want do you think they'd license it leo or do you think they'd roll their own?
[01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:06.760]   I think they're probably licensed at this point like a little sister and drill
[01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:14.680]   If they want if if they really want to be competitive and I don't I cannot imagine that amazon or google would not be ecstatic
[01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:20.680]   To simply have I have a big problem solved that is to say that we will we will continue to make the $129
[01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:25.160]   A little kitchen speaker, but if someone wants the full symphonic effect
[01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:30.520]   By all means go to our partner at sonos who has the latest version of the assistant or the latest version of our voice assistant
[01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:35.320]   I don't I I don't see that as a problem. I would be surprised if there wasn't some sort of
[01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:41.560]   Red binder already on the shelf ready to be pulled down when it feels like it's the right time to execute that plan
[01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:47.080]   Sonos says users quote can opt out of submitting certain types of personal information to the company
[01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:50.760]   For instance additional usage data such as performance and activity information
[01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:55.480]   We've seen by the way this issue before but most recently with microsoft windows 10
[01:10:55.480 --> 01:10:59.320]   Where if you want to use cortana, you have to agree to give up a lot of stuff
[01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:03.160]   Mostly because everything you say to cortana has to be sent back to
[01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:08.520]   The whole office for analysis and i'm sure that's the same just too because they don't have a mic as far as an owner
[01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:11.480]   Either speaker so they use your smartphone as a mic you have a mic
[01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:13.960]   But I don't think they could use it for this
[01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:18.680]   The many saunter speakers have will adjust right they have I came on what they call
[01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:23.400]   They'll adjust their sound for the room that's true. Yeah, who sticks right? You have to have a mic to do that
[01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:25.800]   Yeah, that's true. So there's a mic in sum at least
[01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:29.320]   Um, but I think I remember when they when they put it in there everybody said oh
[01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:32.520]   Oh, there's a mic in the new sonos speakers are you gonna
[01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:36.920]   Have speech assistant they said no, it's just for the adjusting but maybe
[01:11:36.920 --> 01:11:42.360]   Yeah, I don't know that I would expect them to have an extra accessory you plug into the network to make it work
[01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:48.280]   Because think about exactly how sophisticated the antenna array is even on even on the echo
[01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:58.040]   Uh and think about how sophisticated the pickups are on on the home pod. It's not as realized that the reason the reason why voice assistance tend to fail is
[01:11:58.680 --> 01:12:01.800]   All is not always because of the intelligence
[01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:08.360]   It's because there is not a microphone that is pointed directly at wherever that command is coming from that the device can then hone in on
[01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:11.320]   Uh to make sure that it's getting that that voice accurately so
[01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:15.320]   So sonos says in order for us to provide
[01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:19.800]   The functions we will or do provide I guess the future functions
[01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:23.160]   You'll need to give us your email address your ip address your account login information
[01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:28.440]   Device data information about Wi-Fi antennas and other hardware information room names and error data
[01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:30.440]   That all makes sense
[01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:33.720]   They say we're not going to look at your library and see what you're listening to
[01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:39.800]   Yeah, but it's still valuable valuable information just the simple fact that I have labeled a
[01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:43.160]   Random collection of speakers as living room
[01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:49.560]   And a second as master bedroom and a third as the kids room that in itself is a lot of information
[01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:55.720]   Particularly when you think about how much it also contains how much money i've spent on speakers in each one of those three rooms
[01:12:56.280 --> 01:13:00.680]   It's it's I can't I wish I I wish I could even tell myself
[01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:05.880]   Whether or not this is something to get annoyed about or something. That's not a big deal on one level
[01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:09.240]   It isn't it is not a big deal because if they want to continue to add services
[01:13:09.240 --> 01:13:15.320]   They're going to have to be able to connect you to those services without having to make you click through in another agreement every single
[01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:18.120]   Time they add another service like this on the other hand again
[01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:22.520]   This is complete. This is definitely valuable information from them to have and if they if they are
[01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:25.480]   barring a federal law
[01:13:25.480 --> 01:13:30.280]   Defining my personal information as something that I owned and I simply licensed to
[01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:35.880]   Companies like sonos for my benefit and I can restrict that restrict or rescind that license at any time
[01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:41.320]   There's absolutely no reason why sonos would take a look at this big bag of money on the table
[01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:44.920]   Labeled sell and he's personal information to a tire company
[01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:50.360]   And say well, it's it's legal for us to do it. We have the data. We have his agreement. We can salt to anybody
[01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:53.000]   Why would we not pick up this big bag of money on the table?
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:56.440]   Funny
[01:13:56.440 --> 01:13:58.280]   Plex by the way is doing a similar thing
[01:13:58.280 --> 01:13:59.240]   They updated their
[01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:02.280]   The updated the terms of service essentially saying that we said we
[01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:07.240]   Previously we said that we're not looking we don't have any information on you that we're keeping now
[01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:10.120]   We're saying that we do have we are going to be keeping information about you
[01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:15.800]   That the phrasing of it suggests that it's not like they're going to market your information
[01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:19.160]   It's more like they're they're going to add new services like live tv
[01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:22.840]   Like they're going to add new services that again require access that sort of thing
[01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:27.560]   But once again every time you give something up you're not getting something back for it
[01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:33.400]   And that's so cause for concern analysts piper jafree surveyed teens and found
[01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:39.320]   Wow a big change between spring 2016 and spring 2017
[01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:43.240]   In the year intervening
[01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:45.880]   76 now teens have their own
[01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:48.440]   Phone and it's an iPhone
[01:14:48.440 --> 01:14:53.800]   And 81 expect their next phone to be an iPhone
[01:14:53.800 --> 01:15:00.840]   That is that is huge domination of a very important market segment for people who
[01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:07.960]   You know are following along you want to get those teens hooked on your iPhones early because that that means a lifetime of phone buying
[01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:14.200]   uh juseppe stuto who is the ceo from a fam smack high and ux junkie
[01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:18.840]   Says that's a good news for iam message
[01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:23.480]   And it makes sense. I mean we talk all the time about market share for what's happened
[01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:27.160]   And you know a facebook messenger, but really
[01:15:27.160 --> 01:15:30.920]   If you have 76 percent of all the teens
[01:15:30.920 --> 01:15:37.560]   And they're all using iMessage. That's the dominant messaging platform forget those other guys at least in the
[01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:41.720]   Now they're putting apple pay into it and they're increasing the value of just being inside that ecosystem
[01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:47.880]   And it's also one of the reasons so many teens do use it because if you don't use iMessage if you're on android you're left out
[01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:53.640]   You can get text messages, but you don't get the you know group messaging you don't get all the fun
[01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:56.200]   Get the laser scream don't get lasers
[01:15:56.200 --> 01:16:00.520]   And you wouldn't and i presume wouldn't get paid
[01:16:00.520 --> 01:16:05.000]   You use it well you have third party integration so like venmo and things like that
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.560]   But the built-in stuff is always nice the more you can increase the value
[01:16:07.560 --> 01:16:11.080]   I mean it's it's an old game plan and we chat is mastered this to a
[01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:18.120]   Beyond anyone else's art and science, but the more you can create value in the communications layer the more you that becomes the platform for people
[01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:20.600]   Yeah, iMessage doing okay
[01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:26.280]   Although you have to point out centennial is actually spell it i i i i p h oh
[01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:29.320]   And e when they ask their parents to buy them
[01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:31.240]   Really?
[01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:34.520]   No, well, that's you see that like the texting is now iPhone me
[01:16:34.520 --> 01:16:37.160]   Yeah
[01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:40.440]   Well kit you know it's funny because uh, I noticed this when my kids were teenagers
[01:16:41.080 --> 01:16:44.040]   They they always would add a vowel they go dad
[01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:47.240]   And
[01:16:47.240 --> 01:16:49.240]   exasperation dad
[01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:53.480]   And um, I think that this is just that turned into text
[01:16:53.480 --> 01:16:56.200]   iPhone
[01:16:56.200 --> 01:16:58.680]   Yes, iphone
[01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:01.160]   Daddy
[01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:04.920]   It's like those those people at on twitter who every christmas they retweet people who are angry
[01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:08.760]   They only got a car and an iphone for gifts so it was 69
[01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:12.840]   November 2016 April 2017 76 percent that is
[01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:15.640]   massive growth
[01:17:15.640 --> 01:17:17.880]   Methif growth
[01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:19.800]   You know
[01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:25.080]   I we were talking about this and I was today. I said really that's kind of surprising given how expensive the iphone is but megan reminded me
[01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:29.000]   There are a lot, you know, there's hand me downs. Yeah a lot of hand me
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:34.040]   There's the se in fact, I just got an offer from atnt for a free se if I signed up for two years
[01:17:34.040 --> 01:17:37.320]   So there are ways to get cheaper free iphones
[01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:42.520]   When you see a lot of older people like people who using at least I still see out and about people using iphone
[01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:47.320]   Five iphone five s that they got from their parents or their over sibling or their you know, whoever and I miss works
[01:17:47.320 --> 01:17:52.200]   Just as well on that and they've got good build quality and they generally I mean they there are problems
[01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:56.520]   Of course, but they generally seem to last for several years and they get updates for several years, right
[01:17:56.520 --> 01:18:02.600]   Uh anything else we uh, we should mention here. I'm just looking real quickly
[01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:08.200]   Apple says they're going to spend a billion dollars. We already talked about that on hollywood programming
[01:18:08.200 --> 01:18:10.440]   Netflix topped that
[01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:13.880]   Netflix announced they were going to spend $7 billion
[01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:16.920]   So can I just make a plea right now to netflix, please adopt
[01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:20.600]   Core ml because the recommendations i'm getting from you lately
[01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:25.640]   They make me super sad and I think if you could do some rene like when he doesn't like when he doesn't like when he likes rene
[01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:29.160]   Likes you could give me like thrifter for netflix you could give me much better results
[01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:33.160]   You don't you suppose you see i bet what you're not doing you're not rating every movie after you watch it
[01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:36.120]   But it still says 97 percent
[01:18:36.120 --> 01:18:39.960]   Uh, like 90s rating for you and I look at it. I said i'm never wrong
[01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:44.360]   Yeah, I have never watched anything like you sir. I would never watch anything. Yeah, no, it's completely wrong
[01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:48.440]   But you together you gotta rate your movies on netflix if you want better recommend it
[01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:54.040]   You see like I watch a lot of terra this is a thing though is that there are movies that I think are brilliant that I don't like and movies that I know
[01:18:54.040 --> 01:18:57.080]   We're horrible and I just love that i'll watch that you're confusing it
[01:18:57.080 --> 01:19:01.080]   Well, i'll watch that Schwarzenegger's sheriff movie when he's retiring for the ninth time
[01:19:01.080 --> 01:19:05.080]   We're all watched that even seagull thing which clearly got a squirrel on your head no taste
[01:19:05.080 --> 01:19:08.280]   I know but it's like it's fun to watch and I just I want it to now
[01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:12.680]   But then i'll see like a brilliant merch and ivory movie and i'll just say not not for me
[01:19:12.680 --> 01:19:17.880]   I can't take a third queen's guard in this in this sequence. Yeah, so i'm it's a tough part
[01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:22.280]   Anything to say about we got beta six in the public beta
[01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:25.240]   Vio s 11 and the developers got beta seven
[01:19:25.240 --> 01:19:28.600]   Seems like the pace the cadence has sped up
[01:19:29.160 --> 01:19:34.760]   That anything to say is there is it bug fixes at this point do we get any new features in uh in beta six
[01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:41.480]   They've been making a lot of adjustments like they famously they stopped the the x behavior on the cards in the
[01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:45.320]   In the scene view, there's already the fast apps which are on ipad
[01:19:45.320 --> 01:19:49.480]   They've added the swipe back to the notifications on iponkibor upset that you didn't have those
[01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:52.280]   They've added those back they've tuned a lot of behaviors
[01:19:52.280 --> 01:19:54.760]   Just based on feedback
[01:19:54.760 --> 01:20:00.120]   To work at a lot of these are discussions and a lot of them don't have clear winners as people who have opinions on both sides and
[01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:04.520]   Getting feedback from tens of thousands of people helps you own in on the better approach
[01:20:04.520 --> 01:20:10.120]   And it also it also shows you the stuff that's now at the bottom of the list they're they have time to get to know
[01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:12.920]   So yeah, that's it's it's a good sign that we're really close
[01:20:12.920 --> 01:20:19.080]   Well, here's another sign apple has put up as you mentioned earlier in the show rene videos on how to use ios 11
[01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:21.480]   Yep, which is kind of unprecedented
[01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:25.480]   I mean, I don't remember them doing this before with a version of ios that isn't out yet
[01:20:25.480 --> 01:20:30.360]   I would be breaking nda if I'd done this in previous years. Yeah, right? They certainly couldn't do it
[01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:33.720]   Certainly not while I was writing books on this stuff. Yeah, yes
[01:20:33.720 --> 01:20:39.720]   I mean, I think they could even said we should a working version of a feature under nda while I was writing books on this stuff
[01:20:39.720 --> 01:20:42.760]   Here's uh, here's how to use the doc apparently involves lightning
[01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:48.040]   How to harness the power of the amazing new doc must have shot that during winter
[01:20:50.920 --> 01:20:55.320]   Your hands are test like coins. Ios 11 you need a can from look from it. Look familiar rene
[01:20:55.320 --> 01:21:01.640]   For starters, you can customize your doc with even more of your favorite apps by just dragging them in by the way
[01:21:01.640 --> 01:21:07.560]   This voice sounds very young if you want to open a recent file like touch and hold an app like a teenager
[01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:10.600]   Show less
[01:21:10.600 --> 01:21:13.320]   Which tells you something that's the market apple would love to get
[01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:17.480]   They want all these kids to buy these for their school or laptop, right?
[01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:18.840]   and
[01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:20.840]   drop
[01:21:21.320 --> 01:21:24.280]   And that's how to harness the power of the amazing new doc
[01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:29.080]   Sounds like Emma ston a little bit
[01:21:29.080 --> 01:21:32.440]   Actually for all I know it really is who
[01:21:32.440 --> 01:21:37.640]   The apple certainly has the money to afford that. Yeah, lake bells for a while. I like those commercials. Yeah
[01:21:37.640 --> 01:21:41.080]   Here's uh, how to easily manage your files and folders with the new
[01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:45.080]   File app. I have to open these in a separate page for some reason on my
[01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:51.080]   Lineage and fly through your files using the new search. She's in a wind tunnel with smoke trails. What you'll need
[01:21:51.080 --> 01:21:55.160]   Ios 11 and an iPad
[01:21:55.160 --> 01:22:01.720]   And donut 11 your stuff is all in one definitely aiming at kids and just open up the files app
[01:22:01.720 --> 01:22:07.560]   Now you can manage your most recent files and folders or you can ever send your files and folders
[01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:10.680]   You can even make and manage favorites
[01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:15.320]   Donut is there anything you can search your files from a
[01:22:15.320 --> 01:22:18.680]   Different I know I know we're supposed to be focusing the tutorial
[01:22:18.680 --> 01:22:25.480]   But all I can think about is that donut money. How much money they spent making a hundred donuts
[01:22:25.480 --> 01:22:27.480]   selecting
[01:22:27.480 --> 01:22:29.480]   Three that were okay
[01:22:29.480 --> 01:22:35.640]   And then how complicated that move of hand goes in lifts up donut and and enters the frame again
[01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:37.560]   And there's a bite taken out of it
[01:22:37.560 --> 01:22:42.600]   If that wasn't if they didn't spend like one 60 amount of money that picks our spends an entire feature
[01:22:42.600 --> 01:22:48.200]   Just on that move. Oh, and finally it turned out craig had the perfect bite after all the donut
[01:22:48.200 --> 01:22:51.560]   It was the one that craig had just picked up when he wasn't supposed to but you know, it's a contractor
[01:22:51.560 --> 01:22:56.760]   Somebody like Alex Lindsay doing it. It's not you know, all right. Here's one that involves arubics cube
[01:22:56.760 --> 01:22:59.720]   And chopsticks done more quickly
[01:22:59.720 --> 01:23:03.640]   With multi-tastic. Oh, he caught the fly with a chopstick like mr
[01:23:03.640 --> 01:23:05.960]   Is on me yaki right
[01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:10.600]   Say you're putting together a keynote presentation. So that's a that's a good my generation
[01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:15.160]   Swipe up to open the dock. I don't think any teenagers remember the karate kid or do that
[01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:16.680]   It is on your screen
[01:23:16.680 --> 01:23:18.680]   Oh, yeah, the horrible new little smith version
[01:23:18.680 --> 01:23:22.840]   Not well, but jade windows are live with de jade and smiths have a chopstick fly
[01:23:22.840 --> 01:23:26.040]   Probably not
[01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:28.200]   Wow
[01:23:28.200 --> 01:23:32.280]   And he saw the rubix cube with his left hand with multi-tasking
[01:23:32.280 --> 01:23:35.080]   That's actually pretty cool. Good job hands
[01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:38.040]   Oh three of them
[01:23:38.040 --> 01:23:41.080]   Oh, that's confusing as hell
[01:23:41.080 --> 01:23:43.800]   Three armed man
[01:23:43.800 --> 01:23:47.400]   My wife was killed by a three armed man, you know though, you know now
[01:23:47.400 --> 01:23:49.400]   I now understand what the donut and this chopstick
[01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:53.160]   You go to the next video to find out what prop they use in the next video, don't you?
[01:23:53.160 --> 01:23:55.720]   That's the whole whole point of that
[01:23:55.720 --> 01:24:00.600]   How to ask a scam sign and send a document so they're making the pencil float
[01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:03.960]   Wow pencil and an ipad pro
[01:24:04.360 --> 01:24:06.360]   That was cool with iOS and three hands
[01:24:06.360 --> 01:24:11.640]   And this is super simple first black coconut notes
[01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:15.640]   I'm sorry. It's buffering
[01:24:15.640 --> 01:24:20.920]   Start by tapping the plus plus knows we're seeing diversity in the hands as well. Yes
[01:24:20.920 --> 01:24:26.520]   Diversity it's the new the new diversity. It's like a
[01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:29.960]   Well, at least the hand models are ever gonna merigone
[01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:33.880]   Okay, you're all set to sign but first
[01:24:33.880 --> 01:24:39.880]   Not so much in the in the yeah. Oh coffee ring who painted the coffee ring
[01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:43.720]   And how many times did they have to paint the coffee ring to be perfect, right?
[01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:50.520]   Look at that. Oh perfect coffee ring perfect. They're not just not just that but they had to get approvals on that ring
[01:24:50.520 --> 01:24:52.600]   Do you think?
[01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:55.640]   I bet you I'm sure i'm sure jonnie signed off on it. Yeah
[01:24:55.640 --> 01:24:59.080]   That's not exactly the ring. I was imagining
[01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:01.720]   Whoosh
[01:25:01.720 --> 01:25:04.280]   Sign and send a document
[01:25:04.280 --> 01:25:09.880]   Wow, so yes, it got to get the guy get the magnets in the right place for the hover mode
[01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:12.120]   You were right
[01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:14.760]   So there's quite a few of these had a markup stuff how to
[01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:17.960]   Get around with multi touch
[01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:22.200]   But not not only that but they're short enough that even if people don't use those features
[01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:28.040]   They're aware that these features exist and that's kind of like what we were discussing earlier about how it's difficult when you have
[01:25:28.600 --> 01:25:34.440]   A touch operating system that has features that aren't behind a button or behind a menu or something like that
[01:25:34.440 --> 01:25:38.360]   You have to you have to be taught that you can drag stuff off of
[01:25:38.360 --> 01:25:42.040]   A window tile and into the dock
[01:25:42.040 --> 01:25:46.280]   Icon and then drag it back into someplace else again
[01:25:46.280 --> 01:25:50.440]   These these these are things that people are probably not might not figure out on their own
[01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:55.320]   I mean, I myself in the share in the share sheet and just the regular ios
[01:25:55.480 --> 01:25:59.880]   It took me a long time to realize that I don't have to keep my if I want to
[01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:04.760]   Share something to drop box. I don't have to keep scroll scroll scroll sideways to reveal the drop box icon
[01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:08.600]   I could just press and hold it and then drag it to the number one position
[01:26:08.600 --> 01:26:11.880]   It took me a shockingly long time to figure that out
[01:26:11.880 --> 01:26:16.120]   Because there wasn't a there wasn't an obvious pip or an obvious guide
[01:26:16.120 --> 01:26:21.240]   On the screen to show me though, by the way, you if you hold if you're pressing hold on something it does something
[01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:25.240]   So these even if this isn't really teaching people how to do something use a feature
[01:26:25.240 --> 01:26:30.120]   They're actually going to use it's going to show them that this feature at least exists and they might remember it later on
[01:26:30.120 --> 01:26:36.040]   You know, they if they were smart they put those in snapchat by some maybe they are I don't know buy some snapchat ads
[01:26:36.040 --> 01:26:42.360]   That's where the teens are right or or they're on instagram now. Yeah, I bet they are actually i've seen apple ads i think an instagram
[01:26:42.360 --> 01:26:48.280]   The reason i think it's snapchat is i just read that nbc news, which i didn't know this they have a special
[01:26:48.280 --> 01:26:50.760]   News show just for snapchat
[01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:55.000]   There are a couple minute long news updates a couple of times a day
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:58.440]   29 million viewers in the first month
[01:26:58.440 --> 01:27:02.840]   29 and this isn't even the premier platform anymore
[01:27:02.840 --> 01:27:08.600]   If that's what i'm glad i'm glad that they're not wearing t-shirts
[01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:13.400]   I don't I don't know why that annoys the hell out of me that there's i saw a
[01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:15.720]   a
[01:27:15.720 --> 01:27:19.160]   I don't know if you call it beta, but let's sort of sort of a test show of
[01:27:19.480 --> 01:27:25.480]   This company that was bought out by a huge company media company for 12 13 million dollars
[01:27:25.480 --> 01:27:32.440]   And so here's some of the things we're working on on our new news show and it is again your basic scrawny guy who could be 22

[01:27:51.160 --> 01:27:53.800]   You could shave and you could put on a halfway decent shirt
[01:27:53.800 --> 01:28:00.120]   If you want to do don't pretend that you're just a bunch of exciting kids making your way in the big city trying to reinvent the platform
[01:28:00.120 --> 01:28:02.120]   You're not come on

[01:31:02.200 --> 01:31:07.880]   All right, we'll start with rene so you can get out of here if power goes out again rene richy your pick of the week
[01:31:07.880 --> 01:31:10.920]   I appreciate that so uh my pick of the week is the aki
[01:31:10.920 --> 01:31:15.240]   It's it's this wonderful little aki power adapter if you still have those old lighter ports
[01:31:15.240 --> 01:31:18.760]   In your car. You don't have fancy usb ports like my car
[01:31:18.760 --> 01:31:24.520]   What I like about this one is it sits flush you just put it in and it's almost invisible that it was anything ever other than
[01:31:24.520 --> 01:31:29.560]   Usb ports now it is 2.4, you know, which is it's good for most things
[01:31:29.960 --> 01:31:35.400]   Um, actually might have 4.8. I like I'm not because who uses cigarette lighters anymore, right?
[01:31:35.400 --> 01:31:37.560]   Totally this is perfect
[01:31:37.560 --> 01:31:39.960]   They exist because people made adapters to fit in cigarette writers
[01:31:39.960 --> 01:31:44.840]   Yeah, the only reason they exist and I tweeted out they were on sale yesterday. They're still on sale today
[01:31:44.840 --> 01:31:46.840]   They were on sale for even less yesterday
[01:31:46.840 --> 01:31:51.080]   And you know like mark or I'm wanting a bunch of other people started telling me how long they'd had it and how much they loved it
[01:31:51.080 --> 01:31:55.480]   So I immediately ordered several extras as stocking stuff for us because they're really cheap
[01:31:55.480 --> 01:31:58.920]   You know for electronics component, uh, and they're really useful, especially
[01:31:59.240 --> 01:32:04.040]   I've I've had a much more cumbersome version in this in my car for a long time when I pick people up at the airport
[01:32:04.040 --> 01:32:09.480]   They're thrilled because they can plug their phone in charge it because everyone leaves an airport with almost no power left on their phone
[01:32:09.480 --> 01:32:11.560]   Or if I have my god kids in the car
[01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:14.440]   Their their phones almost always run down and they can quickly plug in
[01:32:14.440 --> 01:32:17.800]   And it just it makes it useful because it's not just one cord coming out of it
[01:32:17.800 --> 01:32:20.200]   There's two cords and it's not a proprietary cord. It's usb
[01:32:20.200 --> 01:32:23.720]   So you can plug in your iphone charging a plug in micro usb it can plug in usb
[01:32:23.720 --> 01:32:28.440]   Anything to fit your multi device family friend whatever dynamic you have
[01:32:28.840 --> 01:32:33.080]   Uh, again super cheap super convenient and they set flush so you don't knock them around when you're moving
[01:32:33.080 --> 01:32:37.080]   It was not doing a thing that they've been doing lately. That's kind of strange
[01:32:37.080 --> 01:32:42.200]   So it's 999 on the amazon, but then they have the buy one get 30 off deal
[01:32:42.200 --> 01:32:46.760]   Yeah, usually it says buy two or something, but in this case buy one
[01:32:46.760 --> 01:32:54.520]   Uh or more and you can get 30 off. So I guess it is kind of a big sale. I mean that means it's uh, it's gonna be like six bucks
[01:32:54.520 --> 01:32:58.280]   So black, you know buy several they have them in white and black and alky
[01:32:58.760 --> 01:33:02.760]   Uh, is it I think a great company. They make good stuff. I get a lot of alky stuff a uk ey
[01:33:02.760 --> 01:33:09.400]   Yeah, so everyone don't listen to this my family friends. You're all getting these this year. Yeah, what a great stocking stuffer. Yeah. Yeah
[01:33:09.400 --> 01:33:12.280]   Then you have to get him a car with cigarette liners
[01:33:12.280 --> 01:33:15.160]   Well, I mean a lot of us don't how
[01:33:15.160 --> 01:33:18.200]   Our model threes have not arrived yet. We're also
[01:33:18.200 --> 01:33:20.680]   Jaunting around and cars that actually do have this
[01:33:20.680 --> 01:33:25.720]   I know lisa's card is never cigarette lighter. My card is never cigarette lighter. Well, you both have tesla's later
[01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:30.920]   No, no lisa has an Audi. It's just uh, it's just the more more recent cars. They stop putting this in
[01:33:30.920 --> 01:33:37.800]   Uh, but what you're seeing more of which I love is usb adapters. So that's that problem, right? Yeah, I love that
[01:33:37.800 --> 01:33:40.680]   Yeah, andy and aqua your pick of the week my friend
[01:33:40.680 --> 01:33:48.440]   Uh mine is kind of a weird one. It's an ios simulator of the r rpn 65 helipac packer. Oh my god
[01:33:48.440 --> 01:33:51.640]   I want
[01:33:51.640 --> 01:33:56.680]   It's yeah, I mean this is incredibly called the first pocket pocket computer
[01:33:56.680 --> 01:34:04.600]   Uh number one. There's something about a vintage shield packer calculator with that those like those lego style keys
[01:34:04.600 --> 01:34:08.280]   Uh a real vacuum fluorescent display
[01:34:08.280 --> 01:34:11.640]   Uh, there reverse polish notation
[01:34:11.640 --> 01:34:14.760]   Also, this was a notable
[01:34:14.760 --> 01:34:17.640]   Calculator because it actually had a magnetic
[01:34:17.960 --> 01:34:22.200]   Stripe magnetic card reader that you just fed cards in from left to right
[01:34:22.200 --> 01:34:26.280]   So you could like write programs probably for doing boring things like statistics
[01:34:26.280 --> 01:34:32.040]   But also doing like really really simple games and just feed it in from a motor would just like suck it in and
[01:34:32.040 --> 01:34:37.480]   And uh read in the thing you have you'd have new programs. Uh, I like it because uh,
[01:34:37.480 --> 01:34:43.000]   I have very very very dim memories of my dad having one of these
[01:34:43.800 --> 01:34:50.200]   That was bought by his company. He was an engineer and having it for a couple of years and my being
[01:34:50.200 --> 01:34:55.080]   Allowed to use it with his supervision once at the kitchen table, but otherwise
[01:34:55.080 --> 01:35:00.680]   It was way too expensive and way too fancy for like five-year-old andy to
[01:35:00.680 --> 01:35:03.480]   To get his get his mitts on
[01:35:03.480 --> 01:35:09.000]   But also it's such a beautiful simulation of an object. It's like it's it's it's exactly
[01:35:09.080 --> 01:35:13.000]   It's it's not almost like it is what I don't like these like fake calculators
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:17.960]   Where and and we chose a font that is sans serif and scott segments in it
[01:35:17.960 --> 01:35:21.640]   So it looks just and because we colored it red it looks like an led
[01:35:21.640 --> 01:35:25.800]   No, it doesn't look like an led. It looks like an led postscript font
[01:35:25.800 --> 01:35:28.280]   This is looks exactly like those old like vacuum
[01:35:28.280 --> 01:35:31.560]   Uh displays that was that were in old hp calculators
[01:35:31.560 --> 01:35:35.640]   And so it's really a lot it was a lot more fun than I thought it was going to be
[01:35:35.640 --> 01:35:39.480]   I bought it because four bucks and I wanted something to play with but then you find yourself
[01:35:39.480 --> 01:35:44.760]   Well, how do you write programs in this? And so you're stupidly you're writing programs for this thing
[01:35:44.760 --> 01:35:48.760]   And you can also it also has every single one of those hp
[01:35:48.760 --> 01:35:51.400]   Program cards that was available commercially
[01:35:51.400 --> 01:35:54.120]   What a great deal
[01:35:54.120 --> 01:35:58.280]   And and when you and when you load one in it doesn't just simply like load in the program
[01:35:58.280 --> 01:36:02.520]   It does the animation of the card sliding from left to right through the card reader
[01:36:02.520 --> 01:36:04.600]   It doesn't make the noise of the motor
[01:36:04.920 --> 01:36:08.920]   That's the only thing it's missing, but it's just such a completely satisfying experience
[01:36:08.920 --> 01:36:11.640]   Uh to use this as a desktop calculator
[01:36:11.640 --> 01:36:12.600]   I can
[01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:17.560]   Of course, it sent me then to ebay to find out how much these things cost on the secondary market
[01:36:17.560 --> 01:36:23.400]   Of the real things and decided that I don't think I want to spend 200 300 dollars for an nostalgic old calculator
[01:36:23.400 --> 01:36:28.920]   But this is for four bucks that i'm definitely in it. So it's a lot of fun for you again and it's rpn right?
[01:36:28.920 --> 01:36:30.920]   So you have to enter yep
[01:36:30.920 --> 01:36:36.120]   What you enter the number one enter eight divided by enter and then yeah and enter
[01:36:36.120 --> 01:36:39.640]   and then do the operation and then
[01:36:39.640 --> 01:36:44.120]   Wow and the pro look at this the paper tape
[01:36:44.120 --> 01:36:47.960]   This is so nicely it was limited
[01:36:47.960 --> 01:36:52.520]   It was it was a system you could plug it into a dock that had a paper tape printer and
[01:36:52.520 --> 01:36:58.680]   Yeah, it was it was quite the scene man personal investment day of the week mean standard great circle navigation
[01:36:59.240 --> 01:37:05.320]   Oh, this is you got it. You just got it. You just yeah, and these are all free once you pay the 399
[01:37:05.320 --> 01:37:10.040]   Yep, but these were this was this is thousands of dollars worth of stuff
[01:37:10.040 --> 01:37:13.160]   and i i'm a big
[01:37:13.160 --> 01:37:19.160]   Another phrase that that I tend to come back to i one of my my favorite things in this world is something that is
[01:37:19.160 --> 01:37:23.400]   Desperately foolish but executed at a very very high level
[01:37:24.120 --> 01:37:28.040]   And so it's like if you're if you're just gonna do hey i put i put my old i put my old my old
[01:37:28.040 --> 01:37:32.600]   My old calculator on the bed of my scanner and map keys on top of them
[01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:39.960]   Okay, that's lame, but if you're gonna say no i'm going to make this a perfect and flawless simulation of this device
[01:37:39.960 --> 01:37:47.400]   Almost to the if this had force if i had had forced touch it would you can even replicate that wonderful key sense
[01:37:47.400 --> 01:37:50.920]   Of an hp old calculator. So this has got all the registers
[01:37:52.280 --> 01:37:55.080]   Oh, what kind of saw what kind of programs do you write in this?
[01:37:55.080 --> 01:37:59.720]   Uh, it's it's an eight i have to have a look at it there are still people writing
[01:37:59.720 --> 01:38:06.360]   There are resources online, but it's it's an it's a it's basically a calculator programming language the hp setup
[01:38:06.360 --> 01:38:10.920]   Uh, it is not really intuitive. It's a little bit like a somewhat language
[01:38:10.920 --> 01:38:17.480]   Uh, it's more like a it's it's almost like a key logger really where it's uh, you're you're running a key
[01:38:17.880 --> 01:38:23.720]   A keyboard macro and playing it back but having to set it up inside your head of how to create registers and how to it's
[01:38:23.720 --> 01:38:29.000]   You can choose from a vintage classic hp 65 or a modern one because
[01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:36.440]   That increases the speed sick and the and the accuracy you get more registers with the modern one, which of course doesn't exist
[01:38:36.440 --> 01:38:41.880]   Uh, oh my gosh. Look at this all the new all the features you get you can add on
[01:38:41.880 --> 01:38:45.400]   Or you can say no no i want it to be as slow and cumbersome
[01:38:45.800 --> 01:38:48.280]   as the original hp 65
[01:38:48.280 --> 01:38:53.640]   This is uh, you're right, anti. This is a work of art. This is fantastic
[01:38:53.640 --> 01:39:02.360]   It's also believable. It's also preserving history. I I just the stuff that archive.org also does to make sure that old games and old max software
[01:39:02.360 --> 01:39:04.520]   Are run on web based emulators?
[01:39:04.520 --> 01:39:05.480]   I
[01:39:05.480 --> 01:39:11.160]   Would have been such a horrible thing of all this wonderful work that those engineers did and also those designers did
[01:39:11.560 --> 01:39:16.200]   Back in the 70s where it disappeared because it's just not a useful object and they're going to be fewer and fewer
[01:39:16.200 --> 01:39:20.040]   These things that actually work and the ones that do work. They're going to be like the the
[01:39:20.040 --> 01:39:22.600]   18th century
[01:39:22.600 --> 01:39:24.680]   mechanized street organs
[01:39:24.680 --> 01:39:29.480]   That used to be on every street corner, but now it's they've got they've got they've all thrown in the world
[01:39:29.480 --> 01:39:34.920]   They're still working so they're in a museum and maybe once every 10 years pbs will do a documentary and they'll take it out
[01:39:34.920 --> 01:39:40.120]   Behind the glass and actually fire it up and make it work with this you can actually play with it and see what these things were like
[01:39:40.120 --> 01:39:44.520]   I really I'm with you. I turned off everything that made it modern
[01:39:44.520 --> 01:39:52.040]   In the in the settings because it was kind of it's kind of fun to see a calculator that has to spend a third of a second thinking about a calculation
[01:39:52.040 --> 01:40:00.280]   Where the display has to blank out for a second because it just doesn't have enough power to refresh the display if it doesn't have a number to display yet
[01:40:00.280 --> 01:40:03.800]   It's just it's cool. Go to the website cu
[01:40:05.640 --> 01:40:15.000]   qv soft.ch there's Swiss because apparently they've got a hp Jones because they also make the rpn 97 pro which was a
[01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.800]   desktop calculator
[01:40:17.800 --> 01:40:20.120]   Oh my god. These guys are insane
[01:40:20.120 --> 01:40:23.560]   This is his stay have a variety of 45
[01:40:23.560 --> 01:40:26.200]   the 30s look at the 35
[01:40:26.200 --> 01:40:32.760]   The first scientific calculator from 1972. Yeah, clearly this and I betch it's this one guy
[01:40:33.160 --> 01:40:35.400]   I'm pretty be pretty sure
[01:40:35.400 --> 01:40:42.120]   Uh, that's amazing. That is amazing. Look at that and they're all very affordable
[01:40:42.120 --> 01:40:45.720]   Good pick handy. You got me all excited
[01:40:45.720 --> 01:40:51.000]   I want to show you my new camera bag. This is from a company that I like a lot
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:55.080]   Uh called think tank and they make a bunch of great camera bags
[01:40:55.080 --> 01:40:58.920]   I've been using what they they call the retrospective five for a long time
[01:40:59.240 --> 01:41:03.080]   But I wanted a little more room. So I just upgraded the retrospective seven
[01:41:03.080 --> 01:41:06.840]   Couple of reasons I like these camera bags first of all, it doesn't look like a camera bag
[01:41:06.840 --> 01:41:11.880]   It looks kind of like a beat up old canvas bag. So you're less likely to get robbed
[01:41:11.880 --> 01:41:19.720]   Man, it has all the compartments you need including this is the seven enough room for a 10 inch tablet or a mac book
[01:41:19.720 --> 01:41:24.760]   To carry that along with your camera because what basically I don't check my camera obviously
[01:41:25.080 --> 01:41:28.120]   When I fly so I need a bag that can hold my camera
[01:41:28.120 --> 01:41:31.640]   But if that's my bag then I need to have enough room to put other stuff in it
[01:41:31.640 --> 01:41:37.880]   This is fantastic all the padded dividers, you know for lenses and so forth plus a lot of pouches
[01:41:37.880 --> 01:41:42.840]   And and spaces here show me the top down view if you can
[01:41:42.840 --> 01:41:47.240]   For uh for stuff one of the things I really like about it in this outside pouch
[01:41:47.240 --> 01:41:52.120]   It also has a cover that you could put over if case it gets wet rainy
[01:41:52.440 --> 01:41:55.960]   But it is waxed canvas so it's going to be pretty water resistant
[01:41:55.960 --> 01:41:59.880]   But if it really starts to downpour you could protect your valuable gear with that
[01:41:59.880 --> 01:42:02.280]   uh, it comes with uh
[01:42:02.280 --> 01:42:08.120]   At least if you order it from the think tech site right now it comes with a little bonus where is where did I put that
[01:42:08.120 --> 01:42:12.520]   Uh memory and uh card holder and a battery card holder
[01:42:12.520 --> 01:42:17.240]   It has really loud velcro so if somebody's sneaking up behind you
[01:42:18.920 --> 01:42:21.960]   First of all, they can't easily lift the flap and they're gonna let you know
[01:42:21.960 --> 01:42:25.480]   But there are times maybe you're a wedding photographer or you're a street shooter
[01:42:25.480 --> 01:42:29.800]   You don't want that noise. This is the sound silencer covers up the velcro
[01:42:29.800 --> 01:42:33.240]   So then it's just a quiet and easy flap
[01:42:33.240 --> 01:42:36.920]   So you don't have to make all that noise when you want to access your camera
[01:42:36.920 --> 01:42:40.520]   It's got a handle and a very comfortable carrying strap
[01:42:40.520 --> 01:42:44.760]   And it's about 160 bucks. It's not very expensive. This is the retrospective 7
[01:42:44.760 --> 01:42:49.000]   But everything think tank makes uh if you ask me is are really good camera bags
[01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.240]   I had the little one which is even less conspicuous
[01:42:51.240 --> 01:42:54.840]   But I have a few more lenses. I want to carry with me on my next trip
[01:42:54.840 --> 01:42:58.040]   So I needed something a little bit bigger. I'm a big fan of the think tank
[01:42:58.040 --> 01:43:02.680]   Uh bags not expensive. They do have some leather ones if you want to get a little more fancy
[01:43:02.680 --> 01:43:06.840]   But I like the this looks like an army surplus like gas mask bag
[01:43:06.840 --> 01:43:13.000]   So nobody's gonna think your expensive camera is in there. They have other colors as well
[01:43:13.080 --> 01:43:16.760]   I chose the uh the khaki because it makes it look more like army surplus
[01:43:16.760 --> 01:43:23.880]   Ladies and gentlemen the power went out but uh rene just just like the energizer bunny just kept on kicking
[01:43:23.880 --> 01:43:28.360]   Can't stop won't stop can't stop the energizer bunny. Thank you rene richie for
[01:43:28.360 --> 01:43:29.160]   Thank you
[01:43:29.160 --> 01:43:32.920]   Gracing us as always with your brains and uh your beauty
[01:43:32.920 --> 01:43:37.320]   I'm more.com if you want to read rene's writing's got a lot of good podcasts
[01:43:37.320 --> 01:43:40.120]   There anything else you want to plug?
[01:43:40.760 --> 01:43:45.560]   No, that's it. I mean we're going we're ramping up for september event and ios 11 and hyce era
[01:43:45.560 --> 01:43:49.640]   So we're gonna have all the help and how to articles and all the coverage and it's gonna be fantastic
[01:43:49.640 --> 01:43:56.040]   Yeah, very excited. So see yeah, so will will hyce here come out probably will when the apple does its event
[01:43:56.040 --> 01:43:57.960]   That'll be part of the announcement
[01:43:57.960 --> 01:43:59.960]   Yeah, I mean they used to stagger it by a few weeks
[01:43:59.960 --> 01:44:04.440]   But then you'd have features like continuity would be on the iPhone and not on the on the mac yet and it was awkward
[01:44:04.440 --> 01:44:10.440]   So recently they've been tightening that gap a lot and I think it's ready based on the we pat it like like kregga go on
[01:44:10.440 --> 01:44:12.600]   On stage and you'll say and we're releasing it today and we're like
[01:44:12.600 --> 01:44:21.720]   Any an echo is at the chicago suntime c w o b dot com
[01:44:21.720 --> 01:44:27.400]   And also a regular on this show and we're always thrilled to have you as well my friend
[01:44:27.400 --> 01:44:30.200]   Always good to have a
[01:44:30.200 --> 01:44:36.200]   Chance to exercise my vocal abilities with a real human being face to face at least once a week once a week
[01:44:36.200 --> 01:44:37.720]   That's all
[01:44:37.720 --> 01:44:39.720]   and incidentally
[01:44:39.720 --> 01:44:44.680]   Let us know either one of you if you get an invitation to anything apple's doing in the next few weeks
[01:44:44.680 --> 01:44:47.640]   And andy we'd love you to come out and be our guests
[01:44:47.640 --> 01:44:50.920]   If if they do have enough i can make that work. Yeah
[01:44:50.920 --> 01:44:55.720]   Thank you all for being here. We do mac break weekly every Tuesday right after ios today
[01:44:55.720 --> 01:44:59.000]   Actually, you should start your day a little earlier as you get ios today and then mac break weekly
[01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:02.680]   We decided to put the two together because well that just makes sense
[01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:09.000]   Doesn't so megan maroni and i talk about ios and then here on mac break weekly. We talk about all of the apple stories
[01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:10.120]   uh
[01:45:10.120 --> 01:45:10.840]   every uh
[01:45:10.840 --> 01:45:14.840]   Tuesday 11 a.m. pacific 2 p.m. eastern time 1800 utc
[01:45:14.840 --> 01:45:19.240]   As i said come by a couple hours earlier and you can watch ios today
[01:45:19.240 --> 01:45:23.000]   If you want to be in the studio had some great members of the studio audience visiting us
[01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.800]   from calgary in uh, canada
[01:45:25.800 --> 01:45:29.400]   Yay, right
[01:45:29.400 --> 01:45:31.800]   Yep, maple leaf forever rah rah rah
[01:45:32.600 --> 01:45:34.600]   And mounties
[01:45:34.600 --> 01:45:37.080]   No, I don't think there you guys are mouties are you
[01:45:37.080 --> 01:45:44.600]   Anyway, uh nice to have you if you want to be in studio. We do ask you email tickets at twit.tv
[01:45:44.600 --> 01:45:48.520]   Uh lately a lot of people i think it's because of summertime i've been coming by
[01:45:48.520 --> 01:45:52.840]   And saying oh, I don't want to watch a show. I just want a tour of the studio and I just want to reiterate
[01:45:52.840 --> 01:45:55.640]   We don't have this the staff is all doing something
[01:45:55.640 --> 01:46:00.520]   There there's no one person sitting there waiting for you to come by so they can give you a tour
[01:46:00.920 --> 01:46:03.960]   So if you come by that's fine. It'd be better if you email
[01:46:03.960 --> 01:46:08.280]   I mean we can accommodate people who just drop in but it's a lot better if you email tickets at twit.tv
[01:46:08.280 --> 01:46:12.680]   So we can make sure that we're prepared for you and if you just want a quick tour of the studio
[01:46:12.680 --> 01:46:17.880]   You may be disappointed unless i'm not doing anything or somebody's you know got some free time because we can't
[01:46:17.880 --> 01:46:21.640]   It happens from time to time that people just don't have the time they're busy
[01:46:21.640 --> 01:46:26.040]   Everybody who's here is working hard getting their shows out for you
[01:46:26.440 --> 01:46:28.920]   So do email tickets at twit.tv and let us know
[01:46:28.920 --> 01:46:34.360]   You can subscribe to the show and get it on demand and get it downloaded to your device anytime you want
[01:46:34.360 --> 01:46:37.880]   All you have to do is go to twit.tv/mbw
[01:46:37.880 --> 01:46:42.680]   We have audio and video versions available there for direct download or streaming
[01:46:42.680 --> 01:46:49.320]   But if you subscribe on your favorite podcatcher, you'll be sure to get every episode the minute. It's available fresh
[01:46:49.320 --> 01:46:51.880]   Hot off the presses
