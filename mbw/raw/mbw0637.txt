[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.600]   I spent all day literally from noon to seven yesterday
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:10.520]   Making to lasagna's I made a red and a green pestle lasagna and bolognese
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:16.600]   But that's the side dish for the giant 15 pound ham that I will be brining
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.000]   in apple cider cinnamon and cloves
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.120]   And then baking because it's not a fully cooked ham's not one of them spiral sliced
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.520]   It's a it's a corn cob smoked ham
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:35.080]   And i'll be brining that and then uh getting up at four in the morning on Thanksgiving day to put that in the oven for eight hours
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:40.120]   So hungry right now that will be glazed with the apple cider brown sugar glaze

[00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.720]   Except for the light on the top was identical to the old brown horse you did
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.560]   Down down dive dive
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.600]   Do you have a claxon when it comes up
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.600]   Got
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.720]   I don't know if the neighbors would appreciate that Alex shall slotted enough when the flames reaches pants so

[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:30.040]   I'll be making uh, i'm gonna do cornbread stick because there's nothing to no hole in a bird to stuff stuff into so i have to make the
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.440]   Dressing on the side i'm gonna make cornbread and sausage sounds good stuffing
[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.760]   I'm making the cornbread from scratch everything's from scratch the noodles for the lasagna everything's from scratch the
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.720]   Uh, even the pesto i thought it was coming to you
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:46.120]   I know I thought I couldn't make pesto at this time of year, but I forgot we live in california
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:51.400]   Where everything is green and I was able to get some nice basil beautiful basil
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.640]   And I made a nice pesto so I had a lot of fun yesterday. It was a
[00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:00.600]   Big cooking day and then I guess really it's gonna be a big cooking week. What are you doing Renee?
[00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:06.520]   No, wait a minute. You already had Thanksgiving. I know I know it's totally not fair. I want to do over
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.840]   But you did the same thing right you did cranberry sauce and this stuff yep
[00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:15.640]   Yep turkey all of that it was great. So if spoiler alert Thanksgiving was tremendous
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:23.080]   Good to know he lives in the future and he will you be suveeding your uh, your turkey today
[00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:29.960]   I'm I'm doing my traditional like peanuts. Thanks. Happy Thanksgiving charlie brown thing where i've
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.840]   Going i'm going to be spending Thanksgiving with uh my sisters and their families
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.040]   But I will also be like cooking my own Thanksgiving dinner
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:44.600]   Like that so when I come home, I will have all the leftovers and everything I want. So yes, I'm suveeding a uh turkey bro
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.320]   A like 10 pound turkey breast
[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.880]   Um, let's see got some stuffing going
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:55.320]   Um doing lots and lots of baking that i'm going to be doing for the family thanksgiving
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.840]   But i'm going to do some extra stuff for myself. So there will be bread and stuff. So yes
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.400]   I've ever said
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:07.320]   I am convinced that the what trips almost everybody up for cooking a turkey is
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:11.640]   Wanting to make it look like that norman rockwell like movie prop like golden
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.120]   Turkey shaped thing
[00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:19.000]   Whereas if you if you just buy two turkey breasts that are incredibly easy to cook
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.800]   Even if you don't suveeding them at a bunch of drumsticks
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:26.280]   Which are so easy to cook if they're not part of the bird and just cook gravy on the side
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:31.480]   It's like you can i bet uh, Alex can you rent like one of those like uh, like fiberglass
[00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:35.160]   Like thanksgiving turkeys and just do that for the pictures and the presentation
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.920]   And then go back into the kitchen and bring out a tray of perfectly cooked
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:43.480]   Breast and and and drumstick meat that's because I think that's the best way to do it
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.160]   I think you could 3d print it maybe
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.760]   I mean that maybe that would be the key just big printer and something else that looks good
[00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:51.160]   And just keep it in that you just keep it in a box. Um, yeah
[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.360]   My my my solution is mostly I just stay out of my my mother-in-law's way
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:58.040]   She's uh from Louisiana and extremely skilled
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:03.720]   So I just uh, I just stay out of the kitchen and let my wife and my my mother-in-law do their thing
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:06.840]   And I cook a lot. I just don't cook on Thanksgiving or Christmas
[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:10.920]   Those are the two days that I just you know, just better to just clear the space do it. Yeah, just clear the space
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:16.120]   Uh, rosica 23 pound frog. We'll get to apple news in a second
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:19.160]   I hope you've enjoyed turkey talk
[00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:23.960]   but uh, I should point out the internet has been really flaky this morning and uh
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:27.240]   This has been experienced across the board by a lot of sites
[00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:32.840]   Uh facebook was down you can see here. This is down detector.com. You can see the flat line
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:36.520]   Facebook instagram, but you see last pass
[00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:45.320]   Uh, you see facebook messenger path of exile. Here's sharepoint microsoft sharepoint with big dead spot
[00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:49.880]   Um, I suspect this isn't any one particular
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:54.680]   Company I noticed people in the chat room complaining that some of them couldn't get to our website
[00:07:54.680 --> 00:08:03.720]   Uh, I think there is some big provider that's gone down. I hope it's not a an attack on the force. Yeah, hulu
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:07.720]   Um, you see this one drive. It's been a number of cloud providers
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:11.960]   Uh, I'm just I'm not sure now. Most of these guys are now kind of back up
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:18.360]   But uh, a lot a lot of people uh complaining about facebook being down. See I didn't even know even
[00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:28.040]   Website website is pretty much the big is that the the central? Uh, yeah, that flat well because that's that runs the apps everybody else is
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:35.880]   And as you notice internet service providers have been fine verizon a tnt com. Yes, it's so it's so it might be like a routing table
[00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:43.560]   Sort of problem. Yes, certain party party has in the past couple of weeks. Yeah, it's not the bgp problem where google traffic was routed through china
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:51.720]   Thanks to nigerian internet service provider these things have and then they went pakistan's pakistan tried to like shut down youtube for pakistan
[00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:53.720]   They wound up shutting it down for almost everybody
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:59.080]   That's I mean that's that's real. You've got don't know it's running your show at that point
[00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:01.240]   So it had created for such a simple
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:06.280]   Uh person to be able to cause such an international global problem
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:12.600]   It reminds it's it's the scary reminder that yes, the internet is under threat by national interests
[00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:18.520]   But also by it's also vulnerable to the fact that it was created in the 70s and 80s by hippies
[00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:25.080]   Who didn't who could not anticipate how how making things open and free and transparent?
[00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:31.080]   Which screw everybody in the 2000s once the non nerds got ahold of the internet so a ws
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:35.240]   Uh, i'm just looking at their service health dashboard. It looks like there was some
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:40.280]   issue with the the elastic complete cloud in northern virginia, which I bet a lot of
[00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:45.160]   People run on api and launch error rates, but not any down down
[00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:48.120]   Stuff so I I don't you know, I just don't know
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:52.440]   What it is. I just wanted to note that it's it's happened
[00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:57.560]   Uh, it seems to have been repaired and we don't know what the what the story is so
[00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:06.760]   Corco Maltese has weaponized the internet. Yeah doomed. Well, uh, we let me see it twit our twit website part is very complex
[00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:10.680]   Um, but part of it does run off through
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:14.760]   Not on but through amazon web services. So I don't know
[00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:18.680]   It's so complex that I don't really even understand it
[00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:23.880]   Yeah, but uh, that could be that's that's the other problem with the internet. Yeah
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:27.320]   We trust that it works, but we don't we
[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:33.720]   It's it's the we're now in the phase where remember now that you opened the lid the the hood to your car
[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:39.080]   And there's just this plastic bonnet covering everything you have no you no longer even know that okay
[00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:41.800]   That's the alternator a better or a better. It's a little battery connection
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:47.880]   There are fewer and fewer people who know what's wrong with the internet when the internet is no longer making us happy
[00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:52.040]   Yeah, according to internet traffic report internet the internet itself is working fine
[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:57.480]   But see if amazon had a problem or somebody some provider had a problem it wouldn't necessarily show up
[00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:00.040]   as an internet traffic issue
[00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:04.600]   So I don't I don't know what's going on. I don't it's complicated. It's complicated
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:09.560]   Face tech time says facebook and instagram are down and the internet goes crazy
[00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:14.440]   No, no, it's facebook being up that makes people crazy
[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:16.200]   Both
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:21.000]   That's my opinion facebook is jeez everybody uh all the fangs
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.560]   Are uh suffering they're all down including apple 20 percent
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:28.040]   Uh over the last couple of days
[00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:33.480]   Facebook amazon apple netflix google all down about 20 percent
[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:40.440]   Um, hey, they had a pretty good run. Yeah, I mean some of this could be profit taking the stock market itself has gone down
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:47.160]   There's some uncertainty maybe some of this comes from the wall street journal report and I know that we do this every
[00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:51.160]   Every year but i'm gonna repeat it again
[00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:54.120]   uh wall street journal says
[00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:55.560]   that uh
[00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:57.960]   iPhone sales suck and all the suppliers are
[00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:04.200]   Back or say apple said don't make any more but rene i'll let you you should probably have this canned
[00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:09.960]   Uh, I mean I do at this point. So there's two things one is sales could always go down any given year
[00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:14.840]   Um sales could be down we're in a mature market and most people have a smartphone and the
[00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:20.920]   The result of everyone wanting massive growth in smartphones and to have the next billion and to have massive market penetration
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:24.120]   Is at some point the market gets penetrated and there's no apple stores on mars
[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:27.880]   Uh, the the other side of that though is that historically every quarter
[00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:32.840]   Especially every big quarter there has been a run of hedge fund managers jim cramer
[00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:37.320]   Had a remarkably canned that interview about this many years ago where he said that whenever they want to make money
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:41.320]   They just call up and start a rumor saying the i don't know how that guy's not in jail
[00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:47.880]   I just don't understand i i don't know either and they and they all do it and they said that apple sites love to run those rumors
[00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:51.080]   So there's never any lack of anybody to publicize it for them
[00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:55.800]   And they get the stock to go down and they sell their shorts and they make their they make their quarter and they're super happy
[00:12:55.800 --> 00:13:01.240]   So this is today's wall street journal. I guess yesterday's wall street journal headline apple suppliers
[00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:09.640]   Suffer with uncertainty around iphone demand in recent weeks apple slash production orders for all three iphone models that it unveiled in september
[00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:15.320]   But if I remember uh you saying this last year when the same exact story was published
[00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:20.840]   Well, yeah, so they make a lot of them they announce them they sell a lot of them and then they say, okay
[00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:23.240]   We can slow down production now
[00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:26.920]   And also if you were if you were apple and you you know
[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:29.880]   There's been a lot of years where we haven't been able to get the phone quickly
[00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:36.600]   And so if I were apple i'd be telling our suppliers to be ramping up be ready for right something much larger than what i expected
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:40.920]   And then I would pull them back. It's not very nice to the suppliers to do that
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:44.360]   But it also means that as apple you have a better chance of getting
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:51.960]   Uh, what you needed quickly and have them really ready for the the kind of demand that sometimes we've had and a lot of times we can't get our
[00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:55.560]   We can't get our our phone for months because it's way behind
[00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:59.880]   So gap is notorious for not really caring so much about suppliers, right?
[00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:03.880]   Well, yeah, that because they're they want their
[00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:09.000]   Suppliers are supposed to be big boys and big girls who know how to run a business
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:09.480]   That's right
[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:15.080]   And remember that it used to be every single quarter after the after the iphone announcement quarter
[00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:23.080]   Uh, the shareholders would complain analysts would complain that wow you let the waiting lists for for ideal models was like two three four weeks
[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:27.800]   They're turning away people who had money in their hands. Why can't app why can't apple solve their supply issues?
[00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:30.280]   So apple is
[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:32.840]   Admits people trying to say oh well. This is an artificial
[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:37.400]   Suspension of demand because they wanted they like to have the pictures of all those people in line
[00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:42.840]   And no, they really want to take the money of anybody who shows up with money to throw at an apple logo
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:49.640]   And now that they're finally getting into a verb where they can figure out how to make sure that everybody who wants a phone can get them
[00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:53.800]   At the time what they want them even if they want them on day one or week number one
[00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:59.880]   Sometimes that means that that means making sure that you're your customers are happier than your suppliers
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:02.200]   So that's absolutely not a problem
[00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:07.480]   And and a lot of companies do this where they cut back, you know based on a variety of things
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:09.480]   There's no one else cares about their pride
[00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:14.760]   No one else is tracking how many that and who they called and I mean this is a very common process
[00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:17.320]   Is to ask for more than you need and then pull back
[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:20.520]   You know we're a supplier for companies that do that
[00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:24.440]   So it's it's not it's not uncommon for that kind of thing to happen
[00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:29.560]   It's just that no one else is they're not tracking every suppliers need for all these different services and goods
[00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:35.880]   Well, I don't know I watch billions and according to what I've learned about the market from hbo
[00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:44.120]   Uh, one of the things that really good investors do is go to instead of just reading the you know market
[00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:50.600]   Newspapers they go and they check and they call and they make calls and their journal says last week big suppliers of iphone components
[00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:52.920]   Including corvo
[00:15:52.920 --> 00:16:00.920]   Lamentum and japan display cut their quarterly profit estimates citing reduction and previously placed orders from a quote large customer
[00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:05.720]   Not apple wasn't named but but a third to a half of revenue in these companies according to the journal
[00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:08.280]   goat come from apple
[00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:10.840]   Foxconn
[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:14.520]   Cut over time hours typically available during peak production periods
[00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:20.120]   But again, this you know the the market might draw a conclusion that the iphone isn't selling well
[00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:23.800]   But it could as you know as we've explained there's there's could be good reasons for this
[00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:25.960]   What do you think about maybe the tenr
[00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:29.560]   Being a little disappointing because that is brand new right?
[00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:34.440]   The iphone that came out a month later. Is it maybe that the tenr isn't selling that well?
[00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:38.840]   I mean there if you look across the industry like sam san is you know
[00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:42.920]   They're rumored to be making a super phone now because they want to sort of regain the the luster of the past
[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:44.920]   Nobody's selling a ton of phones anymore
[00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:51.000]   And again, it could just be that the market is reaching a point where you have to look at the business differently the tenr seems to be popular in north america
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:56.520]   Whether it's popular or not internationally is difficult because the currency exchange is injurious
[00:16:56.520 --> 00:17:02.680]   At this point like a seven hundred fifty dollar phone in the us is a thousand dollar phone in Canada and it's worth in europe in brazil
[00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:06.680]   Yeah, and russia and places like that and that probably does tamper demand
[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:11.960]   So there's a whole and component prices one of the reasons iphones are so expensive right now is component prices are through the roof
[00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:13.800]   Which makes it unfavorable for everybody?
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:17.640]   So there's a lot of as a confluence of a lot of factors that could be putting heavily
[00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:23.960]   On the iphone, but also apple brings on new suppliers all the time and it's possible that pegatron is doing more that pegatron is doing more than
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:28.840]   then um fox con right now or it's possible that a different supply company other than japan's
[00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:34.440]   Supplies picking up other volumes and it's really hard to sort of pick and choose one or two suppliers and see what the pattern is
[00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:37.160]   And we may know the the other problem here is that
[00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:44.040]   In every single presidential administration before this a company like apple felt like they could make plans
[00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:51.080]   Two three four five even eight years in advance even very conservative plans, but still they could plan well well ahead
[00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:54.280]   And now when I talk to people who are making those kind of decisions
[00:17:54.280 --> 00:18:01.800]   They're like we're not counting on any deal that we make today being enforceable in two or three years because the downside of
[00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:07.000]   The downside of having our entire product run of a keynote product in
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:15.720]   2020 rely on our ability to access a certain supplier at a certain rate in 2020 is now kind of in question right now
[00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:18.920]   So it doesn't mean that they are not making phones anymore
[00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:23.720]   But it does mean that decisions that used to be a slam dunk are now there's a lot more math involved
[00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:25.880]   And they're not willing to again make
[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:34.920]   Gamble their entire company or all their profits for a certain quarter on being able to get access to a certain component that they desperately need from this one supplier
[00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:38.760]   So there's a lot of calculus that is new in 2018 that wasn't
[00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:45.960]   Part of the game in 2015 or 2016 particular tariffs and trade wars. I if you're an e-bike manufacturer today
[00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:50.360]   You're you're suffering. I've bought a couple of e-bikes in the last couple of months and one
[00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:54.920]   One of them the one I've talked about the super 73 these guys just sent me a note saying hey
[00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:59.480]   We're sorry. It's taken so long, but we've actually had to move our manufacturer outside the United States
[00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:03.400]   because 25 tariffs or 30 tariffs on
[00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:08.840]   Chinese made motors, which is apparently the only reasonable place to get e-bike motors
[00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:16.200]   Is killing us he said we got one shipment that we couldn't accept because it would have cost us 300 000 in tariffs
[00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:21.800]   And so what they're doing is their ship. They're trans shipping them to Germany or where they're going to make them there
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:28.360]   Where they don't have to pay that 300 000 but that slows everything down as they set up new production facilities and also by the way
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:33.640]   Cost jobs in the United States and I'll ultimately cost consumers because the tariffs just get passed along
[00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:39.480]   And Apple may have seen this coming at when they said they weren't going to talk about unit sales anymore
[00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:42.840]   You know like that. Well, that's so that's really what i'm asking here
[00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:47.160]   I know this happens every year, but what i'm really saying is maybe there is something to it this year
[00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:52.840]   Maybe because iPhone sales growth was zero close to zero over the last quarter
[00:19:52.840 --> 00:20:01.960]   Um, maybe there is and one of the things I maybe think you could draw from this is that the we saw this with the five c right and the se that
[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:09.320]   Really people who buy iPhones aren't looking for the low price leader. They're looking for they don't want to give give up features
[00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:12.680]   They want the one terabyte they want the best one. Yeah, right?
[00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:17.000]   Yeah, and I think that apple has seen that this is the market that they're I don't think that it's
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.200]   That they're being elitist, but they're the market that's buying their phone
[00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:25.800]   Are the ones that are interested in that are buying it every year are the ones that are interested in these
[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:31.880]   Bigger higher quality phones and so apple's going to sell less units and they're going to move that
[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:34.520]   Uh asp up, you know
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   Based on that because and they're really just reacting to the market that is that is working with them
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.360]   And they have that data and they have been moving towards services for years
[00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:44.520]   It's not like this is a sudden pivot
[00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:51.000]   You know, they're they're really you know, we can watch their in their their income constantly increasing around the phone
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.800]   As opposed to focusing on it and and even things like the watch are you know picking up speed? Yeah
[00:20:55.800 --> 00:21:01.560]   I think the ten hours a great choice. Uh, I don't think you sacrifice much and you save 250 bucks, but
[00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:05.880]   Um, obviously the mark maybe no I shouldn't even say that because we just don't know
[00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:10.840]   Uh, since apple doesn't really sales numbers. No one really knows unless you stood outside an apple store
[00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:16.040]   I think I just use the two x I think I use the two x on my phone way too much to want to go to an r
[00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:22.680]   That's my number. That's second lens that gives you that physical optical zoom you really that is I use that so often that
[00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:27.080]   I'm constantly reframing on my once you got used to it like for the first year. I didn't even do it
[00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:31.560]   Is yeah, you're giving up the second lens you're giving it up an OLED for an LCD?
[00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:36.920]   Although I think that's a minor trade and you're giving up 3d touch which I don't think anybody cares about
[00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:42.440]   So it's it really is the lens that people really care about I guess I don't know well
[00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:47.880]   It's it's it's variable depends on whether people really care that much about the effects
[00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:52.200]   I really think that portrait mode is a bigger sell for most people because still get portrait mode in the
[00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:59.720]   Selfie cam. Yeah, that's that's what that's what that's what I'm saying is that uh, I think that a feature like portrait mode where it's here
[00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:07.880]   Is the picture without portrait mode? Here's there's a feature with portrait mode when you talk about the zoom someone people like us who really appreciate
[00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:12.920]   Photography as opposed to taking pictures taking snapshots we can definitely see the difference
[00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:19.000]   But nowadays even when they're doing an optical zoom. They're not just blowing the pixels up like they were five years ago
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   Every phone now does a really really good job of interpolating
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.480]   Between pixels and trying to make it look
[00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:33.880]   Maybe just like a sub-optimal zoom. So I'm not I don't know if the average person who uses a uses an iPhone for photography
[00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:38.840]   Absolutely appreciates the difference between having that second telephoto lens
[00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:42.840]   And simply having a strictly digital zoom feature
[00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:46.040]   Because I really think it's features like again
[00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:52.600]   Here's like like the like the nice site feature that just came to all the pixel all the pixels cameras that there are people
[00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:58.280]   I have a pixel one like it's two years old. It doesn't have any of the advanced features of the pixel three right now
[00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:03.000]   But it's like I almost don't need to upgrade my phone now because I'm happy
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.320]   I've got a camera that can do things that couldn't do before
[00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:09.960]   And I think that's why things like portrait mode on the on the on the iPhone camera
[00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:14.920]   Are kind of more important than these hardware features in terms of making customers happy. Yeah
[00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:20.920]   Maybe that's it. Yeah, it might be apples done too good a job selling those features making people want them right
[00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:24.680]   Let's take a little break and then Renee Richie's going to apologize
[00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:30.200]   I will sorry. He was wrong. I'm gonna apologize for apologizing. I want to defend you
[00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:33.000]   Okay, I don't think you're wrong, but anyway
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:39.640]   And then we're gonna I think I'll have Alex do this and I'll do this we're gonna snap our iPads in half
[00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:41.640]   It's all uh it's all coming up
[00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:43.880]   It's all coming up next
[00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:49.000]   Our show today brought to you by rocket mortgage from quick and loans time to get a new home time to get alone

[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:23.160]   for the ninth year running fifth year running for so it's
[00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:25.880]   nine years for mortgage

[00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:39.080]   Now they've made it even better
[00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:44.520]   So one of the things that that makes quick and loans so popular with its customers is their focus on the customer experience
[00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:50.760]   And they have and we've talked about it before created rocket mortgage for people like you and me who don't want to go to the bank
[00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:56.520]   We just want to do everything online rocket mortgage is an entirely online mortgage approval process
[00:24:56.520 --> 00:25:02.600]   With with something brand new they call it the power buying process three steps with step one
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:06.280]   We've talked about it before you answer a few simple questions right on your phone
[00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:11.320]   They'll check your credit. They'll tell you what loans you qualify for you pick your loan
[00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:15.240]   You've got pre-qualified approval and all of that in about 10 minutes less than 10 minutes
[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:22.360]   Step two takes place in the next 24 hours a loan officer verifies income assets and credit and they can do that most cases without any
[00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:25.640]   Input on your part because you've already given them permission
[00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:31.320]   They took talk to you know, they have all their trusted partners. They talk to the financial institutions and they
[00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:36.600]   They verify all that information and once they've done that they'll give you a verified approval. That means
[00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:39.880]   Basically you have the strength of a cash buyer you go right to the head of the line
[00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:43.480]   You are there's no contingencies. You're you got the money, baby
[00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:46.840]   That's within 24 hours
[00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:51.800]   Took us two months to get that with the last time we got a loan from the bank
[00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:56.280]   I could tell you right now rocket mortgage from now on for us once you're verified
[00:25:56.280 --> 00:26:00.440]   And this is something new because rates have started to go up. They've uh, they've implemented
[00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:05.800]   They're all new and it's exclusive rate shield approval. They'll lock up your rate. It can't go up
[00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:08.680]   And they'll give you up to 90 days to find a house
[00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:13.320]   Without the rates going up. I don't care if rates are going up. There's won't if they go down
[00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:17.480]   Quick-end loans will lower your rate. That's nice. Either way you win
[00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:24.440]   It's exactly the kind of thinking you'd expect from the america's biggest mortgage lender to get started go to rocket mortgage.com slash
[00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:29.160]   Mac break rate shield approval is only valid on certain 30-year purchase transactions
[00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:32.920]   Additional conditions or exclusions could apply based on quick-end loans data
[00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:35.400]   In comparison to public data records
[00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:40.760]   Equal housing lender licensed in all 50 states and MLS consumer access.org number 30 30
[00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:43.240]   All you have to remember is this rocket mortgage
[00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:45.720]   dot com
[00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:50.840]   Slash Mac break. All right. Who here show a hands has bent his iPad in half to see if it'll break
[00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:59.000]   Why do no I chose to do my Huawei tablet instead like snaggy snazzy labs? I just you know, I blame youtube
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:04.920]   It's just the the incredible rush for youtube view numbers. Somebody's always got a
[00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:07.320]   try to break
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:09.800]   So with some some cherry
[00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:15.720]   Rig everything is the website that cracked the ipad pro in half
[00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:17.400]   the
[00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:23.000]   Your name is this is clearly farce like if you watch zak do that video that is not a serious video
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.560]   He's like saying it's aluminum and running his acto knife across the this side of it
[00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:30.440]   And like this is a button and cut it to me it is clearly
[00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:34.600]   Like comedy theater and then people took it super seriously
[00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:39.080]   The only thing I could take seriously is exact delses make it too much damn money
[00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:45.320]   Man, this is I always breaks my heart was the same thing with the will it blend guys. I hate seeing
[00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:47.960]   Good product on the back of it
[00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:54.920]   No, it's not serious. Yes, this hurts my well, see well the the difference is that the will it blend people
[00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:57.480]   It's it's a waste of good technology, but no one is certain
[00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:04.680]   It's not going to turn into like a 300 word piece on his on a se on a serious news blog about new concerns
[00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:07.640]   Start to arise about the durability of apples new landmark
[00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:12.520]   It's I will I will however I know he's burning the screen. Oh
[00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:16.280]   I will however say that I love to see
[00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:19.320]   extreme durability tests
[00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:25.400]   Test that actually seemed to be within the realm of what could happen because they could have given that to a needy 10
[00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:27.400]   Year old and changed the life
[00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:32.520]   Well, well, even better he could have taken the $800 food bank and changed several lives
[00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:38.280]   But what I what I'm getting at is that my my concern as someone who like
[00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:44.200]   Has a bike and puts things in a backpack and often travels and has a laptop bag
[00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:49.560]   And I buy too many books and things on the trip and I have to kind of over stuff my laptop bag or my backpack
[00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:55.240]   I'm always concerned about is there going to be so much pressure on this thing inside the backpack
[00:28:55.480 --> 00:29:01.800]   That it's going to bend something a little bit. So I would love to see I would love to see the hydraulic drill press guy
[00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:07.960]   Do that only because he has a new he has a new like extremely fine tuned drill press
[00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:13.640]   That could say here's how much pressure it took before it started to bend and then someone else could say well
[00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:18.200]   Here's how here's how much pressure is put on your backpack when okay, just
[00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:22.680]   I went for my I went for my my constitutional the other night
[00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:26.200]   I decided to stop by the supermarket to just get a sandwich for dinner
[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:32.680]   And they had like that really really great sale on diet doctor pepper that like only comes like three times a year
[00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:38.440]   But you have to buy five so I wanted to wound up having to cram like 10 liters of diet doctor pepper
[00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:44.680]   Like immense like 80 pounds worth of stuff in this backpack and my notebook was in the bag as well
[00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:46.760]   And I was pretty much okay with it
[00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:50.840]   But I'm like is this how I destroy a thousand dollar laptop that I don't even own
[00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:56.440]   Because I couldn't turn down 88 cents for two two liter bottle of diet doctor pepper
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:30:01.000]   So these are the sort of durability things we really need to start thinking about because we don't
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.760]   uh
[00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:08.120]   Apple doesn't I don't think they ever talk about the physical durability of their hardware
[00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:10.360]   And I think that that's another
[00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:13.640]   Feather they could put in their cap if they said that not only is it slimmer
[00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:17.640]   But here's how but of course we test everything to make sure that when you put it in your pocket
[00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:21.720]   It won't bend and of course we want to make sure that you'll get many years of life out of your iPad
[00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:25.080]   And believe it or not it is just as durable as any other iPad we've ever made
[00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:27.080]   I really think that should be part of the conversation
[00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:32.040]   Uh before particularly people are going to be laying out a thousand bucks potentially on an iPad pro
[00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:35.400]   I think that there's a certain level of it at some point when you start spending a certain amount of money
[00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:38.600]   I mean this I I broke down by the way. I bought an iPad. I couldn't
[00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:43.160]   I said I was gonna wait. We're not surprised and it looks pretty it looks mighty good
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:47.800]   The you know, I'm gonna end up buying one for my mom. She saw it. She said oh, I like
[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:51.880]   Yeah, Alex when you when you buy an iPad pro, that's not the system breaking down
[00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:55.080]   That's the Alex Lindsey system working exactly as it was intended to
[00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:58.040]   Not gonna do it. I'm not gonna do it. Okay, maybe I will
[00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:00.600]   so so so I
[00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:04.360]   I got it and the thing is is if you're gonna spend $1500 on an iPad, you know
[00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:05.080]   I
[00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:06.280]   I'm going to take care of it
[00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:09.400]   You know like like there's this crazy thing that if I spent a lot of money on an object
[00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:12.680]   I'm probably not gonna shove it in with a bunch of other things and when I you know
[00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:14.680]   I have a backpack that gets pretty heavy
[00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:19.960]   And it and I'll have multiple laptops and multiple iPads that are doing different things
[00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:25.480]   And I will admit that as I stack that as I stack that stuff in in and out when I'm going in and out of the airport
[00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:29.400]   I think of every screen every you know, Ben point every
[00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:33.160]   You know thing that I'm doing the way I stack the bag is thinking through
[00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:37.000]   What's gonna bend and what's gonna be under pressure and what's gonna do all those things
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.560]   Now I admit that my first job out of high school was packing electronics
[00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:46.120]   So I I thought about it early, but but I think that this idea that we can just treat
[00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:51.640]   You know relatively small things that cost a lot of money without any respect. I think is a is part of the
[00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:55.080]   You know, it's not apple's responsibility to some degree
[00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:58.440]   50 bucks on the autobox case in slap it in having travel
[00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:03.560]   My dad dropped his phone and broke it the third his iPhone like the the second day and apple
[00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:07.400]   I guess just replaced it. I mean they didn't have anything they just replaced it
[00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:09.400]   But anybody in an automatic he was an autobox
[00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:13.480]   I'm gonna pull an Andy here. There's some ice cream stores
[00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:15.400]   that if you
[00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:20.600]   Get the ice cream and it falls off the cone as you walk out the door will give you a new ice cream
[00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:26.440]   And there's some that won't right and honestly the ones that don't that seems legit
[00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:30.920]   I mean, it's not their fault, but the ones that do it's like apple where they're being extra nice
[00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:36.280]   But you can't expect I don't think what apple wants to do is have a lot of conversations about when they're when the product breaks
[00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:39.160]   Well, not well, not promising things
[00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:44.360]   But at least assuring you that when you when they start talking about how light and thin this thing is
[00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:47.800]   That's going to be part of the buying
[00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:53.160]   Decision that i'm going to make because you're absolutely right you should take extremely good care of
[00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:56.280]   Things you spend 50 dollars on let alone a thousand dollars
[00:32:56.280 --> 00:33:01.560]   But the thing is this is something that you're going to be carrying with you everywhere and you're going to be traveling with it
[00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:05.880]   And you're going to be putting it in an overhead compartment and then maybe some idiot is going to think
[00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:08.920]   Oh, well, I bet if I could just push this laptop bag all the way to the side
[00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:15.240]   I can can't deliver my particle accelerator sized box inside here because who cares about someone else's laptop
[00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:19.160]   It's like things happen and so it's good to have some sort of
[00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:22.360]   Assurance
[00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:24.360]   Board in your back to protect
[00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:26.360]   Well, I guess my real the only real question
[00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:27.160]   In my opinion
[00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:31.080]   I have a sheet of acrylic that I said I some I use for a lot of different things my travel
[00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:34.040]   But part of it is I like to have something hard and flat
[00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:36.840]   Kind of sit so that I use a Mac book for that
[00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:38.120]   I just healed it with a Mac book
[00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:41.000]   And I actually think that the one the one thing they should let through tsa
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:45.720]   Personally as someone who flies a lot is they should allow you to carry a cattle prod
[00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:53.000]   To shock anyone who thinks that it's okay to touch someone else's bag that is so uncool
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:57.640]   The flight attendants. It's okay, but when you see someone else messing with somebody else's bag without asking
[00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:01.400]   Just want a cattle prod. I just want just just a cat about just right right
[00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:03.400]   The ribs right the ribs just
[00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:06.040]   Isn't it in a common area now that is non-stirring?
[00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:08.760]   It is not it is inappropriate and wrong
[00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:14.040]   And you know it's right up there with people who take more than 10 seconds to get out of the aisle so
[00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:17.320]   Boy, we got a lot of mileage out of that
[00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:20.840]   All I really want to ask dr. Pepper ice cream and uh
[00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:23.640]   uh particle accelerators inside is
[00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:28.280]   Is the iPad more susceptible to bending than any other?
[00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:30.360]   tablet
[00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:34.920]   There was a really great video on snazzy labs where quinn did a arity of zacks video
[00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:39.400]   And he does it with a huawei tablet and he draws on the back of it and he snaps it in half
[00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:41.880]   And he does he pours out dr. Pepper. I believe
[00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:49.640]   Amish to Andy should apple should apple put as they did with one of the phones right put
[00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:51.640]   metal
[00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:57.320]   You know bars in there to protect it against bending or is that really just do that they made a whole new
[00:34:57.560 --> 00:35:00.520]   Aluminum ally they went from 6,000 to 7,000 series aluminum
[00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:04.200]   But that was also because they introduced 3d touch and needed a much higher level
[00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:06.280]   We're gonna be in order for people to be pushing
[00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:10.760]   Yeah, for not to move when you pushed it so there has been there they're doing all those sorts of things
[00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:12.680]   But it is a bit it is a much lower
[00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:17.400]   This is a thing metal bends plastic cracks glass breaks and ceramic shatters
[00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:21.720]   This is material science you pick your material and then you try to mitigate as best you can
[00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:24.360]   I'll exit and do they mitigate well or not as the
[00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:27.160]   Hydrogen from red camera
[00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:32.200]   But it's not the titanium yet. Let's go it. He's waiting wait for the titanium waiting the titanium is coming
[00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:36.280]   Would you mind if I broke this not until the titanium comes? Okay? Yeah, it's the aluminum one
[00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:40.200]   I feel like this would not I mean like I could really put some serious pressure on the latest
[00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:42.760]   I think
[00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:50.200]   The interesting thing is is that I just want to get on some hits on youtube
[00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:54.760]   Oh, sorry, I meant that I I'm from milk toast with my iPhone
[00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:59.880]   Uh, so with my iPhone I I immediately I mean I didn't buy it without buying a case for it
[00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:04.040]   Just because I'm afraid I'm gonna break it, you know and uh that thing you don't have a case on this
[00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:09.160]   I don't put a case with pistol grips on it right now. It is. Never wanted it wouldn't take to a case very well
[00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:12.360]   And number two is I don't feel like I need it like it feels like it's gonna probably
[00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:16.280]   It feels like you could murder someone with it just like counter
[00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:20.680]   Just like an old just like an old movies when someone would like fracture someone skull with a handset of a phone
[00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:24.680]   The hydrogen phone looks like you could kill somebody by hitting them over the head with it
[00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:30.840]   But but I just I just want to I just want to say just to my point when amazon introduced like they're new
[00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:34.600]   Oh my god like 80 dollar version of a color fire tablet
[00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:38.680]   Uh, which which I think we can describe as a suspiciously low price
[00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:41.640]   For a color tablet that runs a modern operating system
[00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:46.840]   They actually said here is video of it actually like in the tumbled drawer and they said here
[00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:51.320]   But feel free to like just drop it and not throw it but just drop it on the center
[00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:58.520]   This med floor if you want to uh, which is partly because they were it's selling this as this is a good tablet to give to your kids because
[00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:01.160]   Hey, it's 80 dollars if they lose it if they throw it out of the car door
[00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:06.280]   It's you're still gonna punish them for it, but you're not gonna be you're not gonna be that heartbroken about it
[00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:11.880]   But also making the point that just because it's an 80 dollar tablet that doesn't mean that it's made out of mars a pan or anything
[00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:19.880]   All i'm saying is that it would be great if apple were showing as much pride and all of the engineering that they absolutely do to make this as
[00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:25.160]   Structurally strong as they possibly can as they do with all the other great features of an ipad
[00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:27.640]   Because again, that's something that's going to be on people's minds
[00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:31.800]   Uh, and it's it's but it isn't it isn't it terrible though that when these things happen
[00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:37.560]   There are always those commenters saying you know, I'd be great if apple did some actual real words world stress testing
[00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:41.160]   Shut up. They do they do so much testing of these things
[00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:44.440]   That they're not going to make it impossible to bend but once again
[00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:51.640]   It's a nice thing to see that I re we reassure you that don't think that just because it doesn't look as strong as a generation
[00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:57.640]   One ipad it isn't as strong as a generation one ipad or at least a three seconds to bend it instead of four seconds like last
[00:37:57.640 --> 00:38:01.240]   You did it look like he pushed that zak pushed it really hard or did it look
[00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:06.920]   Look at here's my eye phone. It's my eye phone 10s. You if I just do it a little bit. It's not
[00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:09.080]   Oh
[00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:14.040]   Oh, they're going to be usually oh a million. Oh, I broke it. I broke it. I broke it three million views
[00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:17.240]   Oh my god. Okay. I didn't I said it was not made out of marga pen
[00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:19.800]   But some of them are made out of licorice. I stand corrected
[00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:24.280]   This one I can't break these are all three
[00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:27.480]   I think that's not my thing. I didn't bend the iphone 10s even the max
[00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:32.920]   You the video for that one. Yeah, it was just not not but that's a much smaller package and it's much thicker
[00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:35.160]   So i'm trying to judge this based on
[00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:39.160]   How red his fingertips are as he's pressing
[00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:43.720]   Let's let's does Alex have his pointer from the takedown he could do it right now. Yeah, let's see
[00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:45.640]   I suspect
[00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:47.960]   based on the redness of this thumb
[00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:51.400]   And that he's not pressing it that hard
[00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:54.200]   I don't know could be
[00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:55.560]   Of course I could uh
[00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:58.760]   Again giant sheet of aluminum and glass you could probably fold it if you want it
[00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:01.640]   I could just color it in a little bit
[00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:07.320]   Again in that that kind of a folding gesture if you're literally trying to fold it
[00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:12.680]   I can give the ipad a pass on that what i'm worried about is again unpacking my
[00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:17.960]   unpacking my laptop bag when I get home from a trip and seeing that there's actually a bend in the screen because
[00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:23.880]   Again, there was some pressure. There's there's pressure. Yeah, that's bad. I've seen that work in my backpack. Yeah
[00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:29.160]   Right, you put the ipad down on the table and it rocks slightly. That's not a good feeling
[00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:33.480]   Yeah, that's not a good look at and and I have to say in the past if I have to
[00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:39.320]   It's so funny because I used to always worry about this with my uh macbook air and now that I have an air again
[00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:42.360]   It's so light. I carry it sometimes by the corner
[00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:47.160]   You know down by the next to the track head like i'm carrying it around open and I go whoa
[00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:52.680]   Because I i'm pretty sure I've actually destroyed a logic board by doing that by torquing it a little bit
[00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:57.880]   Right and that's probably not a good idea, but it you just kind of tempted is to carry it around with you
[00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:04.600]   Yeah, it's it's what's what's legal legal legal legally. It's called what's an attractive nuisance. It's an attractive nuisance
[00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:08.200]   It's like it's not it's not that you're supposed to carry it that way
[00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:11.640]   But when you make something that's that light that you you want to carry from room to room
[00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:13.960]   You're not going to get people down first
[00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:19.960]   Park the heart park the hard drive heads put it to sleep once you get the light goes on close it and then put it in a bag
[00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:26.200]   No, you're going to just basically lift it by a corner and do that. So yeah, that's an attractive catch of myself doing that thing. Oh
[00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:30.680]   So far no problem, but but so that's not that much different
[00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:36.200]   Maybe they've put some rigidity bars in there to make it better, but I I'm sure i'm sure they've done tests
[00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:40.600]   I'm sure they've done engineering the problem with this kind of engineering is that you when you do the tear down
[00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:43.560]   You don't see a carbon fiber gusseted frame
[00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:45.960]   Like you do on the other side of a sports car
[00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:52.920]   You just have to see the files that they use when they when they carved out that that aluminum case
[00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:55.240]   like a Alex excuse me
[00:40:55.960 --> 00:41:02.840]   Like uh, like rene said you have to see the alloy that they came up with knowing that they're making their own special kind of metal for this case
[00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:09.960]   Uh, so that's why see even just some sort of a paper on apple site would be great. I I love the
[00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:13.400]   I like the fact that
[00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:16.680]   Google has a lot of blogs where if you don't understand how a certain
[00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:23.480]   Feature that they're they demoed works. There's going to be a paper from the ai team that explains exactly how it works
[00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:28.680]   I would be great if apple had a blog like that where they could simply not not as a promotional thing
[00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:33.640]   But basically let the people who designed their rigidity and the durability of the ipad pro
[00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:40.520]   Talk about how much work they put into it without without having to haul out that white backdrop and tar and talk just past the camera
[00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:46.200]   Toughest time bad we've ever made they've never had to do that. You know you can bend see these are like
[00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:52.440]   I think they showed their they showed their testing equipment. Right. Yeah, we call him leum
[00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:58.120]   Uh, the only they only show their work when people doubt that they do that work
[00:41:58.120 --> 00:42:03.880]   Remember the time the time that the time that uh when antenna gate happened. That's when you find out there
[00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:08.040]   They're antenna testing labs. Uh, it's really it's unfortunate
[00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:13.960]   Uh, but I think that I think apple could avoid a lot of problems if they were if they were more
[00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:20.840]   demonstrably proud of the legitimate pride that they have in a lot of the engineering that goes into these devices
[00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:26.200]   Yeah, it's kind of sad because we just gave in given zak even more hits on youtube and stuff. It just
[00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:29.640]   It's again. It's it's a fun. It's a fun video. I was expecting one of those
[00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:33.480]   I was expecting one of those horror horror or apple tree
[00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:37.240]   It really it really was one of those, you know, it's
[00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:40.280]   It's fun to watch somebody else destroy something again
[00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:46.200]   If you put past the idea that some someone who can't afford one of these things or once I again
[00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:47.560]   I think of that as
[00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:51.560]   $800 at a local food bank like as donating food is great
[00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:55.000]   But they get even better deals on food that they buy themselves
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:59.800]   So $800 would have spent what had gotten a lot helped a lot of families in your region
[00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:01.240]   But it's not again
[00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:03.880]   I I'm the person who just spent like $6 on
[00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:09.160]   Diet soda that shouldn't be drinking that probably could have bought a few meals so I shouldn't really complain at all
[00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:12.600]   Renee ritchie. I'm more my bad
[00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:18.760]   I was wrong about the iPad pro you felt obligated to re review it. Why?
[00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:21.080]   so I
[00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:25.160]   Let me give some context here when I reviewed it I reviewed the hardware because to me iOS
[00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:29.000]   12 was a known quantity. I'd already spent 20 minutes reviewing that or
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:33.400]   6,000 words reviewing that and I was up to 20 minutes and 6,000 words on this
[00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:37.400]   So I didn't want to recapitulate what I felt was a was a known quantity
[00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:38.680]   And a lot of people said yes
[00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:42.520]   But apple has escalated the hardware so it is fair to revisit the software
[00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:47.160]   And also it seems like everybody decided to review like if you go down the list on youtube names
[00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:50.520]   Literally every review is can iPad pro replace your laptop
[00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:56.360]   Which to me was like I didn't even think about it because apple so specifically from steve jobs that tim clukas said
[00:43:56.360 --> 00:43:58.360]   It's not a laptop replacement
[00:43:58.360 --> 00:44:03.320]   Um, I didn't I didn't consider that and a lot of people said you should have considered that so I decided to re review it
[00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:08.440]   I understand the confusion because like with the what's a computer add?
[00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:12.680]   Apple has kind of a lie that this is the computer of the future
[00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:17.640]   No, totally 100% but it's like an iMac and a macbook air are both computers
[00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:23.480]   But an iMac is not a laptop like there are different tools along the same spectrum that will suit different need paths
[00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:28.600]   But the minute you have what would people replace with an iPad except a laptop you aren't gonna replace an iMac with it
[00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:33.880]   I mean with some people some people are gonna want a very high end like they're gonna like I have a 15 inch man
[00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:36.600]   Pro that I use for final cup pro and I'm not gonna take it with me
[00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:38.920]   Everywhere so I use the iPad
[00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:44.520]   With the screen and the keyboard and the pencil this costs. Oh, this is what a laptop costs
[00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:45.880]   Sure, I think though
[00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:51.160]   I think the view of some people the alternate view is that it's an alternative to a laptop for people who don't need the specific areas in which a
[00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:52.600]   laptop excels
[00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:56.520]   They and they prefer the areas in which an iPad excels it is a legitimate alternative to it
[00:44:56.520 --> 00:45:03.000]   That's kind of what I said everything that a laptop has if you could buy legitimate if there's an app you use maybe it's light room
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.400]   uh that
[00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:10.120]   Sings and you'd rather use the iPad for it than a laptop than that's a good choice for you
[00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:15.000]   But it isn't I I don't I'm sure you said this it isn't a replacement for a
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:20.840]   A full laptop it only if you do one thing or two if the things you do
[00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:24.920]   Makes sense. I think it's more an adjunct. I think apples intent
[00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:27.400]   It's completely normal
[00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:33.000]   Is that you buy the apple watch the iphone the iPad and an an a laptop and maybe an iMac too and that way
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:36.280]   Also, you'll have everything people and I use this example way too much
[00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:39.720]   But there's a bunch of people for whom those traditional computers and it's a large market
[00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:41.320]   I've just never been accessible to them
[00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:42.760]   They've been confounding
[00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:48.280]   Confusing really smart people who they've been made to feel less than because they didn't understand terminals or file systems
[00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:53.880]   Or just the paradigms that have grown up through geeky computer science hippies that Andy mentioned at the beginning
[00:45:53.880 --> 00:46:00.520]   Now to a massive mainstream audience and to to a large segment of the market and I think that's where you see the sales numbers for ipad
[00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:06.840]   This is a computing device that does not have to be a traditional computer or a laptop and they prefer it that way
[00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:13.400]   My my again, we've talked about this a couple times, but where you really see that as the under 10 and over
[00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:15.320]   60
[00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:18.840]   Range when you're in an airport. Those are all ipads
[00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:22.520]   You know like you know we're all tablets and and there's there's a bunch of us in the middle of that
[00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:25.400]   And I you know that that are using computers
[00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:28.280]   But but it's like it is a replacement for a large portion
[00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:34.200]   My kid, that was Steven Sanofsky's contention is that we only think it's not a full computer because we have preconceived notions
[00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:38.520]   We're the generation that has spent a lot of time on a computer
[00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:41.720]   You know I have been you know so so we you know that that tend to
[00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:48.680]   Or maybe even I would say 15 maybe we're the last generation that wants a command line or the last generation that wants to use a mouse
[00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:52.840]   To edit text or remember the last generation that wants to actually write computer code
[00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:59.400]   But we still want to do those things but but I think that but but my kids are learning my kids are learning swift on on their iPad
[00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:02.600]   You know and they're and they're typing away and and eventually swift is going to be there
[00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:08.040]   I mean I think that for instance we're in an evolution. This is one step towards that that computer
[00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:10.040]   I mean I think that when we look at like Final Cut
[00:47:10.040 --> 00:47:17.400]   They made an announcement last week. I think it was last week that basically Final Cut is not going they said it's gonna be so they're gonna support
[00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:24.040]   The avid formats and some of the other formats for Mojave don't expect to be supported any further than Mojave
[00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:26.360]   You know for your video formats
[00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:30.680]   Now if I were building an iOS version interesting if I was gonna build an iOS version
[00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:34.920]   Or an ARM version of a laptop or an iOS version of Final Cut
[00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:37.640]   That's exactly what I would tell you in the future
[00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:42.920]   You know so I think that there is a you know we're looking at an evolution here of you know
[00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:45.800]   This may not be there yet, but I'm even now
[00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:50.360]   I've I now probably spend 50 percent of my time on my iPad
[00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:56.760]   I mean since I got actually since I got the newer one, you know, I kind of and I admit admit that I'm experimenting with that process
[00:47:56.760 --> 00:47:59.160]   But I'm finding myself much happier
[00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:02.200]   If I'm in a meeting, I don't take my laptop anymore
[00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:04.920]   I just take my lap my you know if I'm having a meeting I don't take my laptop
[00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:07.000]   There are things that I still need to do it on it
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:11.720]   Um stuff like omni-graffle and other things like that. I'm still using you know and obviously
[00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:16.680]   Uh final cut and those type those types of things, but I'm finding myself more and more
[00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:20.920]   Happy with that and part of it's just forcing myself to do it as soon as I force myself to
[00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:23.720]   I'm just going to use my iPad for this because I know that it can do it
[00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:30.680]   I immediately find that oh, this is much nicer and I can now draw in the middle of my notes and I can you know the the note taking apps or not
[00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:35.560]   uh perfect, um, but uh, but I think that um
[00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:38.440]   I think that they're getting much better
[00:48:38.840 --> 00:48:43.480]   The other thing like to me is the biggest symbol the biggest sign of all this is that at the same event apple introduced an ipad
[00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:46.600]   Pro and a macbook air because they realize that there are different
[00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:51.160]   Piscigants of the market and both those products will be hugely attractive to different people
[00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:55.720]   And the sort of part where I have a problem is if you say if you can't do all you work on an ipad pro
[00:48:55.720 --> 00:49:00.600]   Then you're just a dummy and you're not trying or if you say like there was this huge controversy and I won't name any names
[00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:02.600]   But it's all over twitter for the last four days
[00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:05.800]   Very popular tech tech media company and some of their people
[00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:09.240]   Basically said if you use an ipad pro then you're not doing f-ing real work
[00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:12.680]   And I think that's huge consulting if you name names and how said that?
[00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:17.000]   No, that's on twitter. I don't want to but it's uh, it's just not
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:20.680]   I'm looking on twitter and if I don't do twitter, I'm missing out. I guess
[00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:24.520]   Yeah, no, and I think that you know, but but they work may be different than yours
[00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:28.760]   They might be a real estate agent an architect. They might be the illustrator doing all the stuff for a star trek
[00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:34.440]   They might be uh, just there's so many deejays musicians who are doing amazing work
[00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:39.160]   And just because it's not your work does not mean it is invalid. Well, and I grant I completely grant you that
[00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:41.240]   That's why I want to know who said that and the
[00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:42.440]   the
[00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:45.080]   We should not underestimate they haven't really talked as much about it
[00:49:45.080 --> 00:49:50.920]   But but the the partnerships apple has as built with sales force and ibm have yielded huge returns
[00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:56.360]   You know and and so when you're talking about salespeople and a lot of business organics. Oh, yeah
[00:49:56.360 --> 00:50:01.560]   It's all so microsoft selling that they call them first line workers microsoft's really pushing
[00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:06.840]   It's effectively tablet version of windows right to first line workers
[00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:10.920]   Even the ones with arm processors that are really slow because they don't have the same needs
[00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:14.920]   Right and that something they hold in their hand as they're checking in people at a gate
[00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:19.400]   But it's not even just that it's like sales folks. Uh, we've had people absolutely
[00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:26.040]   Um, I definitely have had people in my company that have just decided they're using an ipad because they're not doing the the technical end
[00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:27.640]   and they're
[00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:31.800]   Totally 100 ipad, you know, so it's it's not it's it's definitely a
[00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:35.960]   Uh, it's definitely possible, you know to do to do all of that
[00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:43.080]   Okay, I've I've found the tweet but unfortunately it uses profanity and I can't read it. Yeah
[00:50:43.080 --> 00:50:51.160]   Tom wern from the verd. Okay, uh says uh, I'm quoting his tweet here niele
[00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:56.360]   Made this point on verd cast. I have not listened to that show so i'm not gonna comment on something i didn't listen to
[00:50:56.360 --> 00:51:00.280]   Uh, but the people who have replaced their laptops with the ipad are people who do
[00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:02.920]   flick all work
[00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:06.440]   Uh the rest of us hardworking people use a laptop because we have real stuff to do
[00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:11.400]   Other than some email is nielei or is this niele? No, this is tom's this tom
[00:51:11.400 --> 00:51:18.120]   Responding to nielei or paraphrasing or paraphrasing or paraphrasing so it was nielei who said it but see that's nielei right there
[00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:20.360]   That's the same. That's how he wants to be
[00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:23.080]   He wants to generate that kind of traffic
[00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:29.320]   I'm not the only reason he said that taking away the headphone jack is a hot hostile anti consumer move right
[00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:34.440]   A user hostile move it's just it's it's it's hyperbole in the service of a point
[00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:37.560]   Okay, but I think it's representative of certain where I to be fair
[00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:42.680]   I have used those exact words that I believe taking away a headphone jack unless it's impossible to include one is
[00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:45.000]   How he was right about that?
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:46.840]   I'll grant him on that one
[00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:50.200]   But I think the point being the nielei likes to use strong language
[00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:53.800]   Yeah, but I think it's representative of a certain segment of the tech community who kind of
[00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:58.520]   Like it's like anyone who lives north than you is a northerner anyone who does different work than you
[00:51:58.840 --> 00:52:05.080]   Is not a pro like oh you're just not a pro and it's sort of like how dare apple take fire from the gods and make it accessible to a
[00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:08.280]   Bunch of other people and I want to push back on that because these people are doing work
[00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:11.640]   They could never do before and it is every bit as professional. It's just different
[00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:14.680]   And also let's not let's also point out that
[00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:21.800]   Someone with if someone has three to four hundred dollars to spend on a really good computing solution
[00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:26.840]   Let's just call let's let's cut through the controversy by simply saying for something as a computing solution
[00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:31.160]   Uh, they're gonna get a lot more value from what I've seen out of a
[00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:33.880]   $329 ipad
[00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:35.960]   Then they will out of any
[00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:38.600]   300 $400 windows
[00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:43.320]   Windows notebook and many but not all three to four hundred dollar chromebooks
[00:52:43.320 --> 00:52:46.680]   And it will cover everything that they want to do
[00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:49.160]   just this there's such a
[00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:57.160]   The earlier that as adults we can glom on to one of these really important topics the better the rest of your
[00:52:57.160 --> 00:52:59.320]   Life and the lives of everybody you interact with will be
[00:52:59.320 --> 00:53:05.320]   Don't give people crap for liking the things that they like the things that are working for them
[00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:08.760]   Uh, it's if anything have them explain to you
[00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:15.720]   How excited they are and why they're happy with this thing that you want to hold by one corner because you think it's a filthy
[00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:19.480]   Thing that was swept out of of some sort of a grease trap
[00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:25.560]   It's so horrible because you'll learn something at least about either about that hardware or about how other people use technology
[00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:31.640]   In a i'm not i'm not commenting on this tweet. I want to really make it clear. I'm not commenting on this tweet
[00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:35.240]   Uh, but i'm saying that personally speaking only for myself
[00:53:35.240 --> 00:53:37.560]   Uh, I think that I do a better job
[00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:45.800]   The better I understand how other people use technology that my expectations for indian octos work are not necessarily
[00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:50.920]   Universally applicable to how other people uh approach their work or their goals
[00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:54.840]   and I when I was when I grew up I grew up on a farm and
[00:53:55.880 --> 00:54:01.640]   We all had trucks like everybody has a truck everybody's got a truck and you can't understand how you could live without a household with a truck
[00:54:01.640 --> 00:54:03.880]   That doesn't that you can't put stuff in the back up. You know
[00:54:03.880 --> 00:54:09.640]   Drives a truck. It doesn't drive a truck is doing if all work and that's kind of how we
[00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:14.360]   You know like the only thing that we had a certain area that's true
[00:54:14.360 --> 00:54:18.120]   You know the we're gonna remember the four f 150 is one of the top selling
[00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:20.280]   Cars in the united states
[00:54:20.280 --> 00:54:23.800]   So, you know, there's a lot of us out there that need to haul things we need to put things in the back
[00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:27.640]   We need to you know and but but but my mom didn't need to drive a truck around
[00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:32.840]   Uh, you know and and she she you know, but when we grew up and we I started driving a truck when I was 10
[00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:37.320]   You know like and so it was not mostly not on the road. It's a little on the road
[00:54:37.320 --> 00:54:40.200]   So anyway, so but the but the uh, but you know
[00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:45.720]   I think that we looked at it as something you had to have and no one had a house that household that didn't have a truck
[00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:48.760]   And I'm not everyone drove a truck, but it was something that you all had
[00:54:48.760 --> 00:54:50.760]   You know and because there were things to do with it
[00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:56.120]   And I think in the same way we look at computers is you know, the laptop to me is still the same way Steve jobs at it
[00:54:56.120 --> 00:55:01.880]   It's still the truck, you know, like there are there's heavy lifting that needs to be done by a laptop or a iMac or those things
[00:55:01.880 --> 00:55:07.240]   But the I really do feel like the iPads have become kind of the cars and the and the and the and the
[00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:11.400]   Is that what job said the phone has become kind of the motorcycle. Yeah motorcycle. I like it
[00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:15.960]   A Vespa maybe depending on which one you get and the Chromebooks and SUV and
[00:55:17.320 --> 00:55:23.000]   Surface is like a minivan. I like the iPad. I think the iPad especially the pricing
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:26.120]   Well, no, because there's a 329 so I shouldn't say but in general
[00:55:26.120 --> 00:55:31.320]   It's kind of like for most people I think it will be kind of like you're not your only computer
[00:55:31.320 --> 00:55:36.120]   But a second I still and I just I what I'm finding more and more is that I really just enjoy using it
[00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:42.280]   Like I just I I do too, but I find I also find myself frustrated. I've been just doing email just doing simple stuff
[00:55:42.280 --> 00:55:47.000]   I found myself frustrated. I find I find myself frustrated with my with my Mac book because I keep on touching the screen and
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:49.000]   That's true and I'm just like oh
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:51.000]   Great. Yeah. Yeah
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:57.160]   So no apology needed Renee. That's a second day to area updated review
[00:55:57.160 --> 00:56:03.080]   Yeah, and I did list a lot of what I think are still roadblocks to iOS and I didn't want to give
[00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:06.760]   I think one of the biggest problems in tech support and I said this before is people tell you the solutions
[00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:10.280]   They want rather than the problems that they have and quite often there are better solutions
[00:56:10.280 --> 00:56:15.800]   And they've thought of and there are things that I have problems with like I like I can move photos and videos in and out
[00:56:15.960 --> 00:56:20.120]   But not audio files or documents or anything like that over you know over direct connection
[00:56:20.120 --> 00:56:24.440]   And there's just a small list of things that I just keep hitting up against and I think those
[00:56:24.440 --> 00:56:27.880]   I think apple will fix those. I mean all of those could be fixed in software really
[00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:31.160]   Yeah, I mean I think iOS 12 was supposed to have quite a big iPad
[00:56:31.160 --> 00:56:34.520]   Component and it got pushed back to 13 because they did all that performance
[00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:38.840]   Like they literally took the best engineers at the company and said make performance amazing
[00:56:38.840 --> 00:56:43.160]   And that person couldn't fix performance issues and do all the new iPad stuff
[00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:44.920]   So they had to push that off to all this year
[00:56:44.920 --> 00:56:47.880]   So I think in in iOS 13 we'll see a lot of that sort of come
[00:56:47.880 --> 00:56:54.120]   There's a parallel is an earth one where j garrick has an ipad pearl that has marvelous software on it
[00:56:54.120 --> 00:56:56.760]   It just we didn't get it on this earth this year. Yeah
[00:56:56.760 --> 00:57:02.600]   What would I mean this is kind of speculative and I know rene you got to go in about 10 minutes or less
[00:57:02.600 --> 00:57:07.560]   But i got so forth already i got so 130. Okay, good. Thanks another 23 minutes, but um
[00:57:07.560 --> 00:57:10.840]   What would you do?
[00:57:10.840 --> 00:57:14.280]   I'll ask all of you uh to the ipad and to ios
[00:57:14.280 --> 00:57:20.360]   To make it. Mm. I mean I guess if you think it's everything it needs to be your answer would be zero
[00:57:20.360 --> 00:57:22.360]   But if it's not, what would you do?
[00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:27.000]   Well, I have like I made a list of six things for just for that video and one is that you know
[00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:31.400]   You can't plug in a drive and take off anything other than video and image files
[00:57:31.400 --> 00:57:34.840]   And it should you should build import export anything when you're using a keyboard
[00:57:34.840 --> 00:57:38.840]   There's no way to navigate without taking your hands off the keyboard. That's my big and that context switching is bad
[00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:43.640]   Yeah, loading web pages you get the iphone version like you go to reddit and you get the iphone version
[00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:50.360]   Of reddit on an ipad and whether it's like a forced uh desktop version or just a different decorative class for for
[00:57:50.360 --> 00:57:54.360]   ipad safari, but it is safari it should just be allowed to be safari
[00:57:54.360 --> 00:57:59.080]   Because i podcast selfishly. I just want multi track recording the way we have video recording
[00:57:59.080 --> 00:58:01.560]   Um, also you can't deploy app store apps
[00:58:01.560 --> 00:58:07.640]   Using an ipad for ipad and I think if you look at adobe's approach where they take it's real photoshop
[00:58:07.720 --> 00:58:10.040]   It's not full photoshop, but it's real photoshop
[00:58:10.040 --> 00:58:18.520]   And if you had real but not full xcode with some sort of online managed environment and developers could at least access their apps and work on subsets of their projects
[00:58:18.520 --> 00:58:23.240]   That would be tremendous and the last one is that I still can't just lend my ipad to somebody
[00:58:23.240 --> 00:58:25.640]   And I believe apple was working on a guest board
[00:58:25.640 --> 00:58:30.760]   I don't know what the status of it is but just being able to hand off my ipad to a different user and have like icloud user accounts
[00:58:30.760 --> 00:58:33.400]   Those six things would make
[00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:35.560]   And of course, yeah, I want final cut for ipad
[00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:39.480]   But just those six things by themselves would make it infinitely usable for me
[00:58:39.480 --> 00:58:42.200]   Yeah, I think for me the number one thing is mouse
[00:58:42.200 --> 00:58:47.000]   Like I I can't there's just a lot of precision where I need to have the cursor in one place
[00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:49.880]   And I need to be able to see what i'm doing while i'm doing it with the cursor
[00:58:49.880 --> 00:58:55.080]   and there's a there's just um, there are things that i'm doing with applications that
[00:58:55.080 --> 00:59:01.240]   uh require a level of precision that I can't get with the ipad and I think that's the thing that keeps me
[00:59:01.240 --> 00:59:04.520]   That's when I go back because i've been measuring that is like when do I go back to my laptop?
[00:59:04.520 --> 00:59:07.240]   When I go back to my laptop if I need to use a mouse or a trackpad. Yeah
[00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:09.800]   I
[00:59:09.800 --> 00:59:14.680]   Renee really hit it on the head. We could have written this exact same piece and the number one thing is
[00:59:14.680 --> 00:59:18.360]   Some sort I won't say necessarily a trackpad or mouse
[00:59:18.360 --> 00:59:22.120]   But an alternative way of being able to interact with the
[00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:30.920]   with the user interface without necessarily having to reach up and touch the screen because the very very very best apps that are out there
[00:59:30.920 --> 00:59:33.240]   have brilliant multi touch
[00:59:34.440 --> 00:59:35.800]   uh, vocabularies
[00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:40.200]   but also if you're really doing lots of super productive screens things the
[00:59:40.200 --> 00:59:43.560]   Uh, the glass screen the glass keyboard is going to do for it
[00:59:43.560 --> 00:59:45.320]   I really think it is
[00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:47.960]   as some sort of a way of uh of adding trackpad support
[00:59:47.960 --> 00:59:52.200]   But if they were to come up with something that was just as good that would be perfectly fine by me
[00:59:52.200 --> 00:59:54.600]   And also if all they did was have the files app
[00:59:54.600 --> 01:00:01.800]   Make the forgive the files app the own the the the sole power in the entire platform
[01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:05.080]   To simply mount a file system through usb
[01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:12.440]   Uh, if if all if I always had to go to files in order to take this usb key thing that i've got that someone just handed me
[01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:18.760]   Or take this sd card and and basically should have it the the have the files app look at it say that okay
[01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:23.080]   This is ntfs. I can deal with ntfs. Okay. This is my this is a mac file system
[01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:27.160]   I can deal with a mac file system. I don't see that there's anything wrong with this file
[01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:31.560]   I'm going to let this appear to files and then i'm going to let the files share to other apps
[01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:36.920]   I can see that that would also solve all of these like three times a year, but absolutely
[01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:40.200]   brings a workflow to a crushing halt
[01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:45.560]   Problems, uh, and the third thing is I would love to see apple be able to
[01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:47.480]   at least to
[01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:54.280]   Consider different form factors for the ipad the idea of a screen and a keyboard separated by a hinge
[01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:59.160]   Is a super powerful concept that I would love to see apple
[01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:04.200]   Do some work on and I know that there are really great third party alternatives out there
[01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:08.440]   But they almost all use bluetooth and bluetooth is not nearly as good as having a
[01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:13.480]   In having an innate connection between the two things and also the fact that there are so many
[01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:20.360]   Really sophisticated and well developed third party solutions to making an ipad work like a laptop
[01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:24.440]   Only underscores how many people want to use the ipad
[01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:28.440]   in a physical form factor the way that a laptop works so
[01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:36.120]   It's there there's solvable problems. I don't I I wonder if apple is capable of just dogmatically
[01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:44.120]   Creating a trackpad interface to an ipad. I feel as though this is like a
[01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:50.200]   Catholic in the 1950s eating meat on fridays. There's nothing stopping them from doing that
[01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:56.520]   But dogmatically it is a repugnant idea and they just don't see any reason why they would want to do that
[01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:59.000]   Which would be kind of sad
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:04.040]   I should point out before we get the emails there is a trackpad on the on-screen keyboard if you press and hold you can
[01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:08.280]   But that's the thing like they have focus ui on apple t like again
[01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:15.240]   I hate presenting solutions, but apple tv has focus ui and you can imagine a world where there are arrow keys and a capacitive touch bar
[01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:19.800]   Facebar that you can use to manipulate it all of these things make it more complex though, right?
[01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:24.520]   I think apple doesn't want to make it more complex. Don't make it more complex. We have a trackpad and software
[01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:26.200]   Yeah
[01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:29.160]   Oh, yeah, but but but the but the correct pads only for like tech selection
[01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:32.760]   It's not as though you can navigate between apps and do things like that
[01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:37.080]   I know apple tv they do because you use this here. I mean they have all these parts
[01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:43.080]   So that these things the correct pad it is it it is there may be this dogmatic thing going up for instance
[01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:46.920]   The things that I have problems with are easily fixed by apple
[01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:52.920]   Like the fact that the apple folio keyboard doesn't light up. It's like yeah, that's kind of bad
[01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:59.640]   But it feels like they intentionally didn't do that. I mean I know that bridge or logic tech and others will make keyboards that light up
[01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:01.640]   But apples does not
[01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:03.640]   It's other things like in apple news
[01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:09.000]   And this is completely personal, but my workflow is to bookmark the stories as i'm reading the news
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:13.160]   There's no easy way the share sheet doesn't offer that there's no easy way for me to do that
[01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:15.560]   It makes apple news impossible for my work
[01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:17.480]   Flow
[01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:21.080]   Uh, and actually google news does work. Although it takes an extra step
[01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:23.640]   Didn't they have a star or something that you could tap along the bottom?
[01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:25.560]   Do they take that away because I don't have it in Canada?
[01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:27.480]   I have to double check. I don't know it doesn't
[01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:29.880]   I maybe i'm not looking in the right place
[01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:34.760]   But the the issue for what I want to do is something I can do easily on a laptop
[01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:39.080]   In a browser, which is be reading a new story and then bookmark it in pinboard
[01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:41.400]   Which is the where I put the stories we're going to cover
[01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:44.600]   Uh, and that I've found that impossible do in apple news
[01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:48.920]   But I don't think it's I think it's honestly because they want to keep it simple
[01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:54.760]   They don't want to you know, it's it's more they not that they can't it's not that they can't put a lighted keyboard on the
[01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:57.160]   But for some reason dogmatically
[01:03:57.160 --> 01:03:59.640]   They have a sense of what this should be
[01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:04.520]   They they have a the apple has a point of view and that's something that I absolutely value them for
[01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:08.280]   It's just that sometimes their point of view difference differs from my own
[01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:13.560]   Uh, and unfortunately, I can't fault them and praise them for the same thing
[01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:17.960]   I they they have a good idea in their head of what an ipad is and what it isn't
[01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:22.920]   My opinion is that sometimes that limits the potential of what they could do with this platform
[01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:28.760]   But it also means that we're not going to have the the ipad centros 640 versus the ipad
[01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:33.400]   Centros 670 c version that are is kind of similar but not really
[01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:37.320]   Uh, I do like the fact that ios is really one ecosystem
[01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:41.160]   That can buy one app that works on pretty much everything and gives me the same experience
[01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:44.520]   But like I said, there's there's potential here that if apple
[01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:51.640]   If apple forgot that they ever talked about the the toaster of the the toaster fridge and
[01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:56.600]   Society that a to a fridge with a water dispenser and an ice maker though
[01:04:56.600 --> 01:04:59.240]   That's something maybe you're not actually
[01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:05.480]   Complicating things with features, but you're actually enhancing something in a way that people will actually like apple
[01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:10.520]   I thought they discontinued the think capsule or the time capsule in the airport long ago, but apparently
[01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:16.920]   They have they've they announced that they weren't doing any new development long ago now. They don't even sell it
[01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:21.960]   So which is too bad because there's still people who love that thing and it isn't that far
[01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:24.600]   Out of date or anything. I just think well
[01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:26.920]   Compared to
[01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:31.720]   That was that was a mercy killing because so many companies have been doing so much great work
[01:05:32.040 --> 01:05:36.920]   Like that went so far past what apple was doing and was it wasn't stuff that apple couldn't do
[01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:40.360]   It's just that they really weren't they really weren't interested in doing
[01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:43.240]   Doing with their own networking products
[01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:47.960]   What like makers of mesh products were doing or even just what makers of a modern
[01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:54.600]   Wi-Fi base station we're doing so that's I think these are the it's it's I call them mercy killing because I
[01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:59.400]   Shutter to think about all the people who were just thought that while i'm in the apple store
[01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:02.200]   I need a i'm by i need a Wi-Fi base station web
[01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:07.880]   The apple the apple version must be the best one since i'm also buying this mac book and also buying this mac mini
[01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:13.000]   It's like oh no, you're essentially buying a night stuck at 2015
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:21.160]   Wi-Fi router and now we've got we've got warp engines and we've got hollow decks and you're still like on impulse powers
[01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:23.240]   That's for the same amount of money

[01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:29.240]   Tim cook interview with axios
[01:08:29.240 --> 01:08:32.840]   Said some interesting things including
[01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:38.200]   This about bro culture in silicon valley o we met I thought I had the
[01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:43.160]   Had the video here we go the the bro culture in silicon valley
[01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:50.120]   Well, I would have the audio and I'm probably doing something wrong
[01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:56.200]   Different people from different. Let me let me start again. You worry about the male dominated culture out here
[01:08:56.200 --> 01:09:00.120]   I think the valley has been open and accepting
[01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:06.120]   to many different people from different walks of life, but I agree 100%
[01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:09.080]   from a gender point of view that
[01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:16.280]   The valley has missed it and tech in general has missed it. I know for one
[01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:22.600]   We spend a lot of the energy on this and are constantly asking ourselves
[01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:26.680]   How can we improve more and listening to what our folks tell us
[01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:30.280]   And I I got to believe other people are doing this too
[01:09:30.280 --> 01:09:34.280]   And uh, so I'm I'm actually encouraged
[01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:39.800]   At this point that there will be more marked improvement over time
[01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:45.400]   I wonder if johnnie. Yeah, I've told tim to wear frames that matches eyes because that's a good
[01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:49.720]   That's a good look. All right. You can see the entire interview tonight on hbo
[01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:55.880]   On axios. There's a thing. There's a thing called tripods. I was gonna. I didn't want to say but yeah, that's
[01:09:55.880 --> 01:09:58.760]   It was a little shaking at their style
[01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:01.480]   I think we're shocked by bro
[01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:03.880]   Yeah, no, that's their style obviously
[01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:09.400]   It goes along with a lot of beard and uh rolled up jeans and they're trying to compete with vice
[01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:12.600]   Right, the vice doesn't even do that. I don't think
[01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:15.080]   That
[01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:21.640]   To watch for those of you listening it was easy to listen to nice and nice audio also asked about regulation
[01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:27.080]   He said i'm a big believer in the free market, but we have to admit when the free market is not working and it hasn't worked here
[01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:29.880]   I think it's inevitable. There'll be some level of regulation
[01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:35.880]   I think all of silicon valley is kind of holding their breath and tipping and tip towing around waiting for the other
[01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:40.840]   Shoot a drop. I think that silicon valley hasn't proven that they can regulate themselves
[01:10:40.840 --> 01:10:42.200]   I mean they're trying
[01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:47.160]   But they haven't you know the problem is is that you have uh you have companies that they're making a lot of money
[01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:50.680]   And it's not just that making a lot of money. It's not just that they're getting rich
[01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:52.680]   You just have to remember that for a company
[01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:56.360]   They do have to consider this thing called payroll like we own companies
[01:10:56.360 --> 01:11:01.160]   You know, there's a thing called payroll and so changing your business model dramatically
[01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:04.840]   Is not something that you can just do especially when you have tens of thousands of employees
[01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:07.800]   Even if you have hundreds or even tens of employees, you can't just decide you're going to pivot
[01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:10.680]   You know and so for them they have a lot of money coming in
[01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:15.640]   That is related to the thing that people are complaining about and I I guarantee they're back
[01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:18.840]   They're trying to figure out how to engineer their way out of it, but they can't just decide
[01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:22.200]   Okay, this month we're not going to do that anymore because that's bringing in billions of dollars
[01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:27.000]   And that's how you pay for everything and so so I think that we have to understand that that's the issue but
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.800]   them struggling with that
[01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:33.720]   is taking longer than most people are
[01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:36.520]   Patient for so they do have they have to move faster
[01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:40.520]   But we also have to understand that there are business reasons to continue to work
[01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:43.400]   also part of the problem is that
[01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:46.600]   Oh, google and facebook and twitter particularly
[01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:52.440]   They didn't they when they designed their service and when they created their corporate culture
[01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:56.680]   They were they were not creating an infrastructure for news and communication
[01:11:56.680 --> 01:12:03.480]   Globally they were creating a fun and wacky way to send pictures of your pets and kids to friends
[01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:08.440]   And send and share links and so now that they find themselves in the terrible position
[01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:13.640]   It's kind of like a car manufacturer that suddenly finds themselves making pizzas
[01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:16.120]   Because they don't understand
[01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:17.880]   Conceptually they don't
[01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:23.080]   institutionally they don't understand that if you're selling food the kitchen has to be clean 100% of the time
[01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:29.640]   That it doesn't matter that you have standing inventory of a perishable item. You have to throw it out. You can't just keep using it
[01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:37.160]   That's the analogy that I think really works here. They don't institutionally know how to run a basic infrastructure where
[01:12:37.160 --> 01:12:42.840]   If you screw things up in the simplest of ways, we're not just talking about a couple of people
[01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:45.560]   Get get their feelings hurt
[01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:50.200]   Or or even that people couple people get killed genocide can be powered
[01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:57.320]   By a lack of attention to what people are doing with your platform and they are absolutely not set up to do that
[01:12:57.320 --> 01:13:06.040]   So this is why they are running so far behind the requirements of what needs to be done to maintain twitter and facebook and google as
[01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:12.120]   Potentially instruments of good as opposed to just this horrible horrible thing
[01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:15.800]   This this stick that anybody can grab for free and hit anybody over the head with
[01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:23.880]   Cook says regulation is inevitable of the tech industry. He also says the tech industry shouldn't
[01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:30.280]   As chewity says that regulation is not necessarily the enemy of innovation
[01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:32.920]   uh that you can have both
[01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:34.920]   and uh
[01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:37.720]   So the only the only thing i'll say about that is that that he'll talk about it
[01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:42.520]   He's talking about it in the context of privacy, but I or in or the people's lack of privacy
[01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:46.680]   But but does he think it's inevitable if they decide to say we have to have a backdoor to
[01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:51.400]   Yeah, that's like that kind of inevitable that but i'm just saying that there's that way. What?
[01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:54.920]   Really dangerous talk, you know to talk about that process of saying
[01:13:54.920 --> 01:14:00.040]   You know we think that the government should step in because the government can step in on a whole bunch of different sides of this of this conversation
[01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:03.320]   He yeah, I think he's talking about privacy more than he is
[01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:07.240]   But it's but he's they are fighting off
[01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:12.200]   regulation in other areas, um, you know with some of the stuff the governments want to do
[01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:16.760]   The part that I thought was really good on twitter when you addressed this was when georgias said that
[01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:21.720]   Mark Zuckerberg and uh, saryll samberg they just keep saying we didn't know we didn't know we didn't know
[01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:24.120]   And it's sort of like I didn't know my kid broke that window
[01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:28.520]   But you still have to pay for that window and if you didn't know your kid is breaking all the windows and that becomes
[01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:34.040]   Negligence at some point and if you want to window repair company then it starts to be a little bit malicious
[01:14:34.040 --> 01:14:38.520]   Or benevolent or something like that and that's I think the part that's gonna bite them in the butt
[01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:45.480]   Is that they they keep playing the same dodge deflect or we didn't know achucks game and that that opens up a huge vulnerability
[01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:47.880]   Well, and I will say that these companies are really big
[01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:53.960]   I don't think we understand like the scale of these companies. There is no way he would know or she would know what you don't say that
[01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:56.120]   Like I never said that they're like
[01:14:56.120 --> 01:14:59.320]   The there you know, it's it would be obvious, but I think it's
[01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:00.840]   We think of our little companies
[01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:06.120]   There's no way a company that size that they would know what communications firm was being used to to manage something like that
[01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:10.680]   That is like three layers down from from them to make that decision and it's it is a
[01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:15.160]   It's absurd that we would think that that that they would know that they would be in the
[01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:17.720]   Everything
[01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:19.720]   But it's the answer to everything. It's not the
[01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:22.920]   Thing is is that okay? I think that we
[01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:29.640]   That we think that they're making every decision there and and you know, there's this thing called delegation that happens in these companies
[01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:34.600]   There's tens of thousands of people making decisions and they're not those decisions aren't being made by that person
[01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:37.880]   You know that person's making decision making very high level decisions
[01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:41.240]   Of we need to move down this direction. You know, I don't think that
[01:15:41.240 --> 01:15:43.880]   I'm not saying they have to fix what they're doing
[01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:47.400]   I mean and I and that was a crazy idea to hire that firm to do that
[01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:50.520]   So someone needs to be you know that needs to be sorted
[01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:56.280]   I'm not saying that bad decision, but to assume that people at the very top are making decisions of that granular would be absurd
[01:15:56.280 --> 01:15:59.880]   Sandberg's responsibility for hiring them. She said she knew
[01:15:59.880 --> 01:16:02.920]   Well, I don't care
[01:16:02.920 --> 01:16:07.720]   I recuse myself from Facebook discussions because I've done what any sane
[01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:11.320]   Person should do which is get completely get Facebook out of their lives
[01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:14.840]   It's it's clearly a rogue company
[01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:17.080]   in my opinion
[01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:22.920]   Again, there's institutional character and it was not surprising to me that their reaction to this over the course of the past two years
[01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:26.840]   Has not been there is a problem. It doesn't matter how it happened. It's our response
[01:16:26.840 --> 01:16:30.040]   We are in a position where we can fix it. It's also our responsibility to fix it
[01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:34.360]   Their position is going to start and end with it's not our fault
[01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:41.720]   We got to make sure we deflect attention away even if it means that we have to put other stories into play that make google and apple and twitter look bad
[01:16:41.720 --> 01:16:47.080]   That is the unfortunately. That's the character of facebook. Um, I would also have to with regret
[01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:49.400]   say that
[01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:53.080]   Facebook still has something that no one else can provide which is
[01:16:53.080 --> 01:17:00.120]   If if there is no place else on the entire internet where if I say that oh by the way
[01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:04.920]   I am going to be in the hospital for two weeks having life-saving surgery
[01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:10.600]   And that everybody will if I tweet that all my readers and listeners will like oh my god
[01:17:10.600 --> 01:17:16.200]   I hope things work out. Well, if I put it on pictures on flicker, no one will find out about it. If I put it on facebook
[01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:19.800]   That's the only way that I'm sorry. I should I should have picked a more uplifting thing
[01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:26.040]   But like that's the only place where unfortunately all of my friends were not deep deep deep nerds
[01:17:26.280 --> 01:17:32.280]   And more importantly than that all of my family members are so if I want to find out how my niece did
[01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:37.720]   In a basketball game. I have to go on to facebook to find that and I don't know that
[01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:43.000]   It's I did make the decision a few years ago that I hate facebook
[01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:47.640]   I don't think that they're trustworthy. I'm going to limit the amount of mission the amount of information I give them
[01:17:47.640 --> 01:17:51.960]   But if I don't want to cut myself off from those kinds of interactions
[01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:55.240]   I'm going to have to have I feel as though that transaction is
[01:17:56.040 --> 01:18:00.600]   With great regret worthwhile rene has to run so before you go rene
[01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:04.280]   Uh, I would like to give you I'd like to ask you one question
[01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:07.960]   Should I buy my mom air pods or wait for an update
[01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:15.480]   For christmas, um, I mean there's always again apple has released products in december before they released a smart battery case in december
[01:18:15.480 --> 01:18:19.000]   But it is unlikely and the last rumors I heard was like a springtime
[01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:23.720]   Okay, uh and right now air pods are in stock more than they've ever been before they've always been sort of in a shortage
[01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:27.400]   They're in stock and there's amazing deals on them. Well, that's the second question
[01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:30.840]   Uh apple's event begins the 23rd
[01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:36.760]   That's all they'll say right now historically apple has not given us great deals on black friday
[01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:42.360]   Should we worry should we wait should I mean i'm not going to buy anything to black friday anyway, but
[01:18:42.360 --> 01:18:47.560]   Um, I did I did a video on this last week and like best buy is going to do a hundred bucks off home pods
[01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:50.200]   It's going to be a bunch of sales on air pods. It's going to be yeah
[01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:54.360]   So best buy amazon those sort of traditional retailers are always your best bet
[01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:57.960]   And if you if you miss one don't worry because it's not black friday anymore
[01:18:57.960 --> 01:19:02.680]   It's like black vember fest like a whole month and a half of sales there will be another one
[01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:07.640]   So just keep an eye out and probably find have a few seconds is there pick you wanted to give us before you leave
[01:19:07.640 --> 01:19:11.480]   Oh the new hue playlights. I've got them on behind me right now
[01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:14.600]   I replaced the blooms with those they're they're hard to find in stock everywhere
[01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:18.440]   And I think best buy has an exclusive so you can't get them on amazon in the us
[01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:21.320]   But you can't get them on amazon in other countries, but they are great
[01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:27.560]   You can put them on your tv behind your tv horizontal vertical and they just pump out whatever color light you want rene get out of here
[01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:35.160]   You're great guys so much i'm more dot com rene richy giving yes happy thanksgiving. Well, you think so what a happy thursday
[01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:39.000]   It's just going to be regular thursday for you
[01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:44.120]   Does do canadian celebrate black friday because that makes no sense. We do now
[01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:51.640]   Have a great every one on your cyber monday giving tuesday and i'll see you next week. Absolutely. Thank you guys
[01:19:51.640 --> 01:19:56.840]   Uh, let's take a break and then i'll get andy and Alex's pick of the week
[01:19:56.840 --> 01:20:01.640]   Uh, but first a word in honor of rene from our canadian friends at fresh books
[01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:06.120]   Fresh books is actually a great site ridiculously easy to use cloud accounting
[01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:09.480]   I don't even want to use the word counting because it sounds like it's going to be scary
[01:20:09.480 --> 01:20:15.800]   But but it's not what it really it does is it does the accounting software kind of automatically behind the season
[01:20:15.880 --> 01:20:17.320]   Why you
[01:20:17.320 --> 01:20:21.800]   Do what you want to do you're the small business owner you're in charge of your business
[01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:26.840]   You continue to do business and let fresh books do the hard stuff. It starts with invoices
[01:20:26.840 --> 01:20:32.920]   You know you gotta send those out let fresh books send professional looking invoices. It's easy to create them in seconds
[01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:38.760]   And you can always see with those invoices when not only in their fresh books dashboard when they were sent
[01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:44.440]   But also when they were viewed by your client when they were paid if they're not paid when
[01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000]   Which ones are overdue?
[01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:51.560]   So there you go by just doing that you've got your accounts receivable don't tell anybody you're doing accounting
[01:20:51.560 --> 01:20:53.640]   You just you know you're sending out invoices. That's all
[01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:59.000]   Incidentally because the minute you sign up for fresh books you can accept online payments
[01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:05.000]   That's part of the fresh books deal. You're going to get paid an average of twice as fast turns out your client
[01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:09.480]   Hates paying bills as much as you hate making bills sending bills
[01:21:09.480 --> 01:21:14.440]   So if there's a button that says pay leo now they're going to push that button just get it out of the way
[01:21:14.680 --> 01:21:16.680]   So you get paid twice as fast
[01:21:16.680 --> 01:21:19.720]   So there you go and you can also now let's see that's uh expenses
[01:21:19.720 --> 01:21:25.080]   Yeah, easy to get the expenses into fresh books take a picture with the fresh books app or the receipt boom
[01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:28.920]   It's in there it can go into the invoice, which makes it very simple
[01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:35.720]   Uh effect they'll even import expenses directly from your bank account every day if you set it up to do that
[01:21:35.720 --> 01:21:37.720]   That's part of it. It's an easy deal
[01:21:37.720 --> 01:21:40.680]   Let's see. So that's accounts receivable
[01:21:40.680 --> 01:21:43.480]   That's expenses
[01:21:43.880 --> 01:21:48.840]   I think and then revenue just by based on paid in but I think you pretty much got yes true
[01:21:48.840 --> 01:21:53.400]   Industry standard accounting and you didn't do anything except stuff you do anyway
[01:21:53.400 --> 01:21:58.920]   It's and you can generate and access real accounting reports general ledger trial balance
[01:21:58.920 --> 01:22:05.240]   You could share those reports with your counter financial advisor only impressed them. They'll say wow you're really doing a good job on those books
[01:22:05.240 --> 01:22:06.440]   That's great
[01:22:06.440 --> 01:22:09.720]   Pretty impressive. Oh, yeah, it's just you know i'm good at this i'm good
[01:22:10.040 --> 01:22:16.360]   But you not spend any extra time at all you're doing your business. You're doing your thing the stuff you love let fresh books do the stuff you don't
[01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:22.520]   They add features all the time. It's a web based app so you can create proposals with rich text content and images
[01:22:22.520 --> 01:22:26.840]   You'll now be able to accept e signatures in those proposals
[01:22:26.840 --> 01:22:29.720]   At from your clients. That's awesome
[01:22:29.720 --> 01:22:34.760]   You can send invoices estimates and proposals in multiple languages and multiple currencies
[01:22:34.760 --> 01:22:36.920]   That's what saved my life when I was billing Canada
[01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:43.160]   It's billing rogers in Canada and Canadian dollars and I kind of hated tapping to figure that all out. They just do it automatically
[01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:48.760]   Fresh books has a mobile app as I mentioned. Let you keep tapping your business no matter where you are
[01:22:48.760 --> 01:22:54.520]   And they're always adding new stuff you can search for uncategorized expenses for instance
[01:22:54.520 --> 01:22:57.960]   Something I always wanted to do it if I categorized everything they just do a search you can find them all
[01:22:57.960 --> 01:23:02.840]   Save time automate more of your workflow. They have more than 70 apps and integrations
[01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:07.720]   With fresh books more than 70 different third party applique like everlands for instance
[01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:13.080]   You with everlands you can maximize deductions autumn actually automatically capture every work mile
[01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:15.880]   They've got bulk actions

[01:23:19.240 --> 01:23:23.720]   And if there's anything you don't understand not only do they have the best support team these nice Canadian folks
[01:23:23.720 --> 01:23:27.160]   But they've got great learning hub videos you can watch
[01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:29.720]   Although I gotta tell you
[01:23:30.440 --> 01:23:34.360]   It's so intuitive you're not probably gonna need to watch those videos, but they're there if you need them
[01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:37.960]   And the year on a high note hit the ground running in 2019

[01:24:08.360 --> 01:24:15.560]   Break andy and not go you're picking a week my friend a couple of tips because you're probably gonna hear this early enough
[01:24:15.560 --> 01:24:18.840]   Before you do your Thanksgiving cooking indoor baking
[01:24:18.840 --> 01:24:25.160]   I just want to share two or three tips that I have considered game changers over the past 10 or 15 years
[01:24:25.800 --> 01:24:27.800]   One of which is crispy turkey skin
[01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:35.880]   Take it off the okay take it off the turkey and make turkey cracklins or like turkey chips instead
[01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:39.720]   You take this you take the skin off while it's still raw. Okay
[01:24:39.720 --> 01:24:44.440]   You basically put it on the put parchment paper over a cookie sheet
[01:24:44.440 --> 01:24:47.400]   Put the turkey skin on there if you want to season it a little bit
[01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:51.080]   That's fine, but it's even fine just as is another sheet of parchment paper
[01:24:51.080 --> 01:24:56.360]   And then like a heavy pot on top of it put it into like a 375 degree free heat an oven for half hour
[01:24:56.360 --> 01:25:01.560]   And you want and serve on the table this basket of like cracked just chips of turkey
[01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:05.560]   Or if you're if you're the household where you don't pass around a platter you basically
[01:25:05.560 --> 01:25:13.000]   Plates get passed forward and someone slices everyone gets like a turkey chip. It's the most wonderful thing
[01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:20.440]   Evac it's almost worth like buying extra turkeys and giving the cats all of the turkey meat just have extra of these chips
[01:25:20.840 --> 01:25:26.680]   Uh, and it's guaranteed crispy turkey skin because you cook the skin separately
[01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:32.280]   Um, the other two tips have to do with making cookies. I'm the cookie person in the family
[01:25:32.280 --> 01:25:34.600]   Uh, two game changers are two
[01:25:34.600 --> 01:25:37.400]   Uh, by making chocolate chip and oatmeal this year
[01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:38.600]   Uh
[01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:43.000]   Take it you probably have seen people like use an ice cream scoop to make sure the portions are
[01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.080]   Absolutely identical. That's nice too
[01:25:45.080 --> 01:25:50.040]   But what you want to do is you want to do it the night before make your make your dough
[01:25:50.600 --> 01:25:53.640]   To use the ice cream scoop to make these like half domes of dough
[01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:56.680]   Put them on a baking sheet and put them in the freezer overnight
[01:25:56.680 --> 01:26:01.000]   Because not only does that improve the flavor, but also it the the next day
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.160]   That's how you get like nice
[01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:07.240]   Thick chewy cookies instead of like spread out or lumpy and crumbly things
[01:26:07.240 --> 01:26:10.200]   It defrost and cooks while it blew it while it bakes
[01:26:10.200 --> 01:26:15.400]   Uh, and also it makes it so much easier that you're just reaching into the kitchen for one two three four five six seven eight nine ten
[01:26:15.400 --> 01:26:19.240]   Half domes put them on the sheet bake them go back in the freezer one two three
[01:26:20.200 --> 01:26:24.600]   And that way you can easily like make fresh cookies that morning without having to be up all night
[01:26:24.600 --> 01:26:28.760]   Uh, and then particularly with like a chocolate a really really sweet cookie
[01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:31.880]   Put some sea salt or some kosher salt on the top of each one
[01:26:31.880 --> 01:26:37.320]   Uh before you bake them they don't know where that extra hit of flavor is coming from but oh my god
[01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:41.400]   It is a game changer. So i gotta write this all down. I really like the one
[01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:43.880]   I'm trying with thanksgiving. I have so much cooking to do i
[01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:49.800]   Like yesterday I made all the lasagnas. I want a bit by bit cook everything and then pop it all in the oven at the end
[01:26:50.040 --> 01:26:53.160]   I even made it I use and this is my this is one of my tips
[01:26:53.160 --> 01:27:00.200]   I used apples reminders and notepad to make a timeline off to ask Stacy tomorrow she did a game
[01:27:00.200 --> 01:27:02.840]   But I had I've three ovens with this shirt
[01:27:02.840 --> 01:27:04.040]   She made a ganture
[01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:07.800]   But I have a june oven and up upper oven alone oven and I have a lot of stuff to do
[01:27:07.800 --> 01:27:12.680]   And all these different temperatures and I had to use a bit I made a timeline. So now on thursday
[01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:18.520]   Nine a.m. Starting at nine a.m. I'm gonna know exactly what to put in when at what temperature and i've got it all figured out
[01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.800]   You know that I have cookies because that's a good idea. I like that
[01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:27.240]   That's that's one of the that's one of the really great winds of a sous vide people talk about it for cooking
[01:27:27.240 --> 01:27:34.040]   But it's also beautiful for reheating because uh it's like mashed potatoes make them the day or day or two before
[01:27:34.040 --> 01:27:36.440]   And then just reheat them
[01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:44.600]   Most vegetables I will I can I when comes like green beans I can either have the choice of making beautiful like fully done green beans
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:51.560]   Two days before with with almonds and again and the dressing and everything and then reheat them or I can do just plain
[01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:58.280]   Boil them and then shock them butter them and throw them into a dish on the morning of it's so because the sous vide
[01:27:58.280 --> 01:27:59.720]   It's not like it's not like
[01:27:59.720 --> 01:28:04.280]   Nuclea and microwaving something or like putting something in the stove so they they all dry out
[01:28:04.280 --> 01:28:10.840]   It really is it's if it's a wet if it's a moist wet sort of thing stuffing potatoes
[01:28:12.280 --> 01:28:16.920]   Things with sauces it actually will come back right back to life right back to temperature
[01:28:16.920 --> 01:28:19.080]   How long do you sous vide the potatoes for like an hour?
[01:28:19.080 --> 01:28:22.440]   I cook them normally and I just reheat them at
[01:28:22.440 --> 01:28:27.400]   165 usually because people like really really hot potatoes
[01:28:27.400 --> 01:28:32.840]   The only thing 165 is my usual like reheat so that they're piping hot temperature
[01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:36.440]   However, if there's meat in there like a chicken or a turkey or whatever
[01:28:36.440 --> 01:28:39.080]   You've well no a meeting again
[01:28:39.080 --> 01:28:43.880]   Something that some of this already cooked we're talking about reheating the probably sometimes I forget that
[01:28:43.880 --> 01:28:49.000]   If at 165 now you're continue you're continuing the cooking process
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:52.760]   And the chicken or the pork that you cook that was perfect at 140
[01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:57.720]   Is now like a little bit tougher and a little bit drier and it's not quite so nice
[01:28:57.720 --> 01:29:01.720]   I I like to get a sous vide that would hold a 16 pound ham
[01:29:01.720 --> 01:29:04.440]   I would be cold
[01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000]   Plus like a pleasant
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.640]   Vacuum bag about the size of what a hefty bag
[01:29:09.640 --> 01:29:14.360]   I could put actually that's really all I'm missing because I could put an ANOVA and a giant tub
[01:29:14.360 --> 01:29:18.920]   I use that for ribs and a cooler. Yeah cooler or something. I could fit the ham in there
[01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:20.920]   But I need a vacuum bag
[01:29:20.920 --> 01:29:25.720]   It's a 16 pound turkey. It's in a bag now. I'm in a bag now. I wonder if it's sealed
[01:29:25.720 --> 01:29:30.520]   It's probably sealed right? Yeah, I just throw those bags right in a sous vide I have
[01:29:31.480 --> 01:29:33.480]   I take things that are vacuum bag tonight
[01:29:33.480 --> 01:29:38.520]   I've taken all kinds of things that are bagging pack and I just throw them in like I've taken like steaks that are already marinated or whatever
[01:29:38.520 --> 01:29:39.800]   And just that's a good tip
[01:29:39.800 --> 01:29:45.560]   But you know trader joe's does some really nice tri marinated tri tip in a sealed bag. I know those in yeah
[01:29:45.560 --> 01:29:47.320]   I do. Yeah, don't take the label off
[01:29:47.320 --> 01:29:51.880]   Yeah, the label usually doesn't come off you'd want to be careful about that getting sucked up into the ANOVA, but
[01:29:51.880 --> 01:29:56.360]   Yeah, it doesn't come off. It doesn't. Yeah, it's no no good tip sandy
[01:29:56.360 --> 01:29:58.360]   Thank you
[01:29:58.360 --> 01:30:01.960]   By the way, if you want to make a conversation piece out of those uh the chocolate chip cookies
[01:30:01.960 --> 01:30:08.840]   There's if you've ever made ona giri, which is the it's like a rice ball that has it's like an in a triangle
[01:30:08.840 --> 01:30:11.320]   There's a little form you can get on
[01:30:11.320 --> 01:30:14.040]   on amazon that
[01:30:14.040 --> 01:30:20.120]   Forms the the triangle, you know for the for the ona giri it makes a great form for chocolate cookies
[01:30:20.120 --> 01:30:25.720]   You know, it's just it's just different. You know, you just have a you're making chocolate chip cookies that are triangular and
[01:30:26.520 --> 01:30:29.080]   And you can just you can press it you're basically sticking that
[01:30:29.080 --> 01:30:29.960]   I don't know about that one
[01:30:29.960 --> 01:30:34.840]   But but there's ones that that you can just that have a press from the top and you can just press down on it
[01:30:34.840 --> 01:30:37.160]   And it'll form it into this nice little triangle
[01:30:37.160 --> 01:30:39.640]   About this. Yeah, I think that that one is a
[01:30:39.640 --> 01:30:43.400]   And it's
[01:30:43.400 --> 01:30:45.480]   Can I get it by tomorrow? No
[01:30:45.480 --> 01:30:47.560]   It just gives you a uh absurd
[01:30:47.560 --> 01:30:52.200]   Triangle there's no good reason but it's triangular cookies in there exactly the same actually if you're certain
[01:30:52.600 --> 01:30:57.400]   Like kitties and you search amazon for cookie molds. You're gonna find a lot better than triangles
[01:30:57.400 --> 01:31:01.960]   I know it's just there's something that the triangles are anyway. They're nice. Yeah, how about
[01:31:01.960 --> 01:31:04.520]   maybe uh
[01:31:04.520 --> 01:31:05.800]   Those
[01:31:05.800 --> 01:31:07.800]   This cookies like a triangle. I like to eat me
[01:31:07.800 --> 01:31:10.040]   How about
[01:31:10.040 --> 01:31:13.800]   The the bonus is you can make ona giri with it, which is amazing. Yeah
[01:31:13.800 --> 01:31:17.320]   How about how about making your cookies look like walnuts?
[01:31:17.320 --> 01:31:19.720]   Huh? Huh? Huh?
[01:31:19.720 --> 01:31:21.960]   That's a russian and you recognize this
[01:31:21.960 --> 01:31:27.000]   Russian cookie paste that i do it. I see i have i have an nephew with a deadly nut allergy
[01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.160]   Oh russian so i could so i could i can't
[01:31:29.160 --> 01:31:35.160]   I could start like a really really bad argument by saying do you really think that i wouldn't know
[01:31:35.160 --> 01:31:40.120]   There's there cookies in the shape of walnuts. Why would you even why would you even try to fool us with cookies?
[01:31:40.120 --> 01:31:42.120]   Take them home. Why just don't be kind of funny
[01:31:42.760 --> 01:31:48.760]   That's why i don't do christmas. Oh goodbye goodbye for him get dinosaurs. There you go dinosaur cookie molds
[01:31:48.760 --> 01:31:51.560]   He's not allergic to dinosaur is he?
[01:31:51.560 --> 01:31:54.200]   Nobody's allergic to dinosaurs
[01:31:54.200 --> 01:31:58.520]   Alex lindsey pick of the week
[01:31:58.520 --> 01:32:05.720]   So i am i'm i had a i had a reverse pick a couple couple months ago with the npr app because they took away the playlist
[01:32:06.120 --> 01:32:12.280]   Oh, man set and and i was you know my whole equilibrium had been kind of thrown off
[01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:19.080]   Uh, and so i'm i'm returning back to pick the npr app because they have added the playlist back into the app
[01:32:19.080 --> 01:32:23.000]   Not only have they added it back into the app, but it is better than it was before
[01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:27.880]   That was a great feature because you could basically line up all the shows you wanted to listen to and get a car for a long trip
[01:32:27.880 --> 01:32:31.800]   It was doing every day. Yeah, and then i stopped and literally just kind of went npr
[01:32:31.800 --> 01:32:37.320]   You know for a long time because i just because i just didn't want to there's npr has in my opinion has a lot of fat
[01:32:37.320 --> 01:32:41.960]   Um in the in the standard morning in afternoon. There's just a lot of things i don't care about
[01:32:41.960 --> 01:32:46.920]   And so there and there about every two or three are like i don't want to listen to that
[01:32:46.920 --> 01:32:51.800]   So um having to skip through them was just kind of a pain and i also like to reorder things like oh
[01:32:51.800 --> 01:32:55.000]   I think this is these are more important stories that if i don't get through all of them
[01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:58.360]   I want to make sure to listen to these ones and i want to rearrange them and so
[01:32:58.840 --> 01:33:03.560]   Um, that's all back. It's all possible in the npr up and and the best thing that they added
[01:33:03.560 --> 01:33:06.120]   Is that now when you're in the playlist?
[01:33:06.120 --> 01:33:11.320]   One of the things that you had to do before is that you had to go to the story and then add it to the playlist
[01:33:11.320 --> 01:33:15.000]   Which is a pain in the neck because once i see the title i know whether i want to listen to it or not
[01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:20.280]   I don't need to read any more description and so they've added the little check mark now that's on the on the list
[01:33:20.280 --> 01:33:21.800]   If you open up
[01:33:21.800 --> 01:33:26.600]   All things considered or if you open up morning edition or weekend edition or whatever
[01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:30.920]   They you can now have you have the little the little check mark right by the title
[01:33:30.920 --> 01:33:34.120]   And I know it seems like a little thing, but if you're building a playlist
[01:33:34.120 --> 01:33:37.240]   It's a real it's a real time saver if you're doing it every day
[01:33:37.240 --> 01:33:40.680]   And so I it's actually better than it was before
[01:33:40.680 --> 01:33:46.760]   It's a great addition and i'm back to listening to my npr every day and um acquire it's pretty it's pretty much
[01:33:46.760 --> 01:33:48.840]   You know, I listen to a lot of different news
[01:33:48.840 --> 01:33:52.360]   Sources because I think you should I don't think you should trust any one source
[01:33:52.440 --> 01:33:58.120]   But but kind of the backbone of of knowing what's going on each day is is usually listening to morning edition and
[01:33:58.120 --> 01:34:01.160]   All things considered in marketplace market place is still all one big
[01:34:01.160 --> 01:34:04.440]   Thing but for some reason market place is denser and I I just
[01:34:04.440 --> 01:34:08.440]   Stuff well, what's funny is is I have the exact opposite relationship with marketplace
[01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:10.520]   They they do all the stories separately and i'm like
[01:34:10.520 --> 01:34:12.200]   Uh, just give me all it
[01:34:12.200 --> 01:34:15.800]   I want to listen to the whole half hour because it's it's very rarely
[01:34:15.800 --> 01:34:20.840]   I don't want to be interrupted and try to figure it out. I actually so it's it's a very it's too opposite
[01:34:21.080 --> 01:34:24.920]   um relationships that I have but those are kind of the the things I listen to anyway, so it's a
[01:34:24.920 --> 01:34:29.000]   I'm putting it backwards. Great. It's it took it off because of you. I'm putting the playlist
[01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:33.240]   Uh, the playlist is better than ever. So if you if you missed it
[01:34:33.240 --> 01:34:37.480]   It's and and then it's the way to listen to npr like once you get used to building your own playlists
[01:34:37.480 --> 01:34:43.480]   Uh, you will never ever go back to listening to any in any other way in my opinion
[01:34:43.480 --> 01:34:46.520]   I will tell you something that npr told me this morning
[01:34:46.520 --> 01:34:49.400]   just uh if case you've got any
[01:34:49.960 --> 01:34:51.960]   Romaine lettuce in your fridge or do it
[01:34:51.960 --> 01:34:58.760]   Uh throw it away. You know, I don't have the cdc is saying there's an ecoli outbreak and all romaine lettuce
[01:34:58.760 --> 01:35:04.200]   Don't serve it for uh, thanksgiving all romaine lettuce should be thrown away. So just a little
[01:35:04.200 --> 01:35:06.920]   We're in a warning here. I have two picks
[01:35:06.920 --> 01:35:10.200]   One you should do one you should absolutely not do
[01:35:10.200 --> 01:35:17.240]   How about that? There you go. So first this one and actually I have a credit, but I want you to try it. Alex. It's it's a uh, free
[01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:22.680]   App noise reduction app that mutes the background noise during your calls
[01:35:22.680 --> 01:35:30.280]   The idea being you're on slack or facebook or skype and talking, you know having a business call and you in the background
[01:35:30.280 --> 01:35:36.840]   Daddy or washing machine sounds or car noise this crisp app. It's for max
[01:35:36.840 --> 01:35:42.120]   You put it on and it actually does the it's using some pretty sophisticated
[01:35:42.120 --> 01:35:46.600]   Technologies here. I'll tell you what let's play a little a little crisp
[01:35:47.160 --> 01:35:51.480]   Audio I'll turn my uh audio back on this is um
[01:35:51.480 --> 01:35:56.280]   That's street noise
[01:35:56.280 --> 01:35:58.280]   Let's should we turn on uh crisp
[01:35:58.280 --> 01:36:03.320]   But still need to make innovation a reality for a little digitize this result, but it's doing AI stuff
[01:36:03.320 --> 01:36:06.120]   Here's a screaming child in the background
[01:36:06.120 --> 01:36:11.640]   That we have nodes that has some connection between them
[01:36:11.640 --> 01:36:16.760]   This is similar to now. That's a hard thing noise reduction is good. It can constant sounds like right
[01:36:17.160 --> 01:36:18.520]   Like an airplane
[01:36:18.520 --> 01:36:21.160]   But getting rid of a child in the background
[01:36:21.160 --> 01:36:25.720]   And the way you do this you train it with your voice
[01:36:25.720 --> 01:36:29.080]   So what it's doing is it's learning what your voice sounds like
[01:36:29.080 --> 01:36:32.120]   And then taking anything out that's not your voice
[01:36:32.120 --> 01:36:35.080]   So that's a kind of an interesting
[01:36:35.080 --> 01:36:39.320]   I saw your link and I haven't gotten a chance to play with it. Yeah, I'm really curious
[01:36:39.320 --> 01:36:43.320]   I think this is you're gonna start seeing more and more stuff that uses kind of
[01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000]   Neural learning
[01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:54.760]   Little about can you hearing before we go on our trip? That's pretty amazing. So so crisp you could find it at
[01:36:54.760 --> 01:36:57.320]   K r i s p dot ai
[01:36:57.320 --> 01:37:04.200]   Yeah, I'm gonna compare it. Uh, so one of the things that we after I saw it we're gonna do next week is um
[01:37:04.200 --> 01:37:06.200]   We're gonna compare it to our cedar box
[01:37:06.200 --> 01:37:10.280]   I don't know if you've heard of cedar, but cedar is like in the in our industry is kind of the standard for
[01:37:10.280 --> 01:37:14.040]   uh noise removal ambient noise removal and uh,
[01:37:14.200 --> 01:37:19.480]   So we're gonna go head to head between crisp and cedar. We've gone head to head with cedar with every other
[01:37:19.480 --> 01:37:23.800]   Live noise reduction. Nothing comes close. Okay, you know, so it's it's all
[01:37:23.800 --> 01:37:29.240]   Um, you know, we can say oh it works differently or whatever, but cedar is really the the only one that really works
[01:37:29.240 --> 01:37:32.280]   Um, and so it'll be really interesting. We'll do a head to head
[01:37:32.280 --> 01:37:35.240]   I don't know if i'll have it ready for next show, but i'll have it ready for the show after that
[01:37:35.240 --> 01:37:39.240]   We'll do kind of that would be great where we we we would be really useful in the background
[01:37:39.240 --> 01:37:43.880]   And we'll do a couple other things and we'll play it through the cedar as well as through crisp and we'll see how they
[01:37:44.120 --> 01:37:47.080]   How they interact that's really cool. The other thing it does
[01:37:47.080 --> 01:37:50.760]   Which i'm very curious about is supposed to eliminate chopping
[01:37:50.760 --> 01:37:53.480]   in voice calls by filling by by
[01:37:53.480 --> 01:37:57.400]   Interpolating and filling in the thing that was dropped
[01:37:57.400 --> 01:37:59.400]   It
[01:37:59.400 --> 01:38:02.280]   Mm-hmm. That would have fixed a couple things on for me too
[01:38:02.280 --> 01:38:07.560]   I mean there's an interesting those are we've had issues with encoders and decoders where it drops
[01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:11.480]   Just little bits like very small slices of a body. Oh
[01:38:11.880 --> 01:38:16.520]   Um, and uh, you know, that would help me a lot. So this is mac only right now
[01:38:16.520 --> 01:38:17.960]   Um
[01:38:17.960 --> 01:38:23.480]   This is crisp and by the way, it does not as they say send the sound back to servers. It's done on device
[01:38:23.480 --> 01:38:27.640]   I'm very interested there. I think they're in brokley. Yeah, they are. I'm not sure they why they're giving it away
[01:38:27.640 --> 01:38:30.920]   But maybe because they're promoting something else. Well and also we're all
[01:38:30.920 --> 01:38:35.880]   It does say featured by Nvidia someone if they're using Nvidia technology to promote this now
[01:38:35.880 --> 01:38:37.720]   That's the thing you want to try
[01:38:37.720 --> 01:38:39.720]   This is the thing you don't want to try
[01:38:40.040 --> 01:38:42.040]   Uh, this is a shortcut
[01:38:42.040 --> 01:38:47.080]   Somebody created you know for shortcuts on iOS called shortcut roulette
[01:38:47.080 --> 01:38:50.840]   The most dangerous least helpful shortcut for iOS 12
[01:38:50.840 --> 01:38:57.960]   It's a game of chicken with your social life built entirely on shortcuts best played with two or more people when you activate the shortcut
[01:38:57.960 --> 01:39:00.360]   You don't know what it's going to do your phone might
[01:39:00.360 --> 01:39:07.240]   Do one of a hundred things for instance, maybe it'll send your last five selfies in a pdf to a modeling agency
[01:39:07.960 --> 01:39:13.160]   Maybe it'll send your nudes to a boss. Maybe you'll get lucky and it won't do anything
[01:39:13.160 --> 01:39:18.520]   I don't know if I even want to download this and i'm on a windows machine
[01:39:18.520 --> 01:39:21.400]   sure
[01:39:21.400 --> 01:39:25.000]   So it really it really is like that internet video of
[01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:31.320]   Intentionally holding a lighter up to an ipad screen only it's your future social life. Yes, exactly
[01:39:31.320 --> 01:39:34.600]   It's truly shortcut roulette
[01:39:34.680 --> 01:39:39.240]   It's just like it does say that all shortcuts can be canceled before they finally execute but
[01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:43.880]   Here's the fun part of the game the first person to cancel a shortcut loses
[01:39:43.880 --> 01:39:46.280]   So
[01:39:46.280 --> 01:39:49.560]   Play this with your friends kids it'd be great fought for the thanksgiving
[01:39:49.560 --> 01:39:52.120]   Especially with relatives. You don't like shortcut
[01:39:52.120 --> 01:40:00.920]   A strange game dr falcon only way to win is not to play exactly out about a nice play game of chess
[01:40:01.960 --> 01:40:05.240]   Uh, I I'm gonna end us with the uh apple
[01:40:05.240 --> 01:40:10.600]   Holiday ad which just came out and we can watch it all together. It's three minutes long
[01:40:10.600 --> 01:40:15.000]   So we'll make it the last bit of the show but before we do that. I want to thank rene
[01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:21.480]   Of course from imore.com. He had to take off andi and naka always a pleasure from public radio in boston wgbh
[01:40:21.480 --> 01:40:26.360]   Happy thanksgiving happy thanksgiving andi i'll be thinking of you and your suvide
[01:40:26.360 --> 01:40:31.400]   I think what i because normally with mashed potatoes you have to make them right before you put them on the table
[01:40:31.720 --> 01:40:33.960]   I'm not thinking this might work really good
[01:40:33.960 --> 01:40:39.240]   I see I have the time to do the butter and the sour cream and everything if I do them like a day ahead of time
[01:40:39.240 --> 01:40:43.160]   That's many of thanksgiving i've been spending with my ricer going like this
[01:40:43.160 --> 01:40:50.120]   I will just I will just say that my my problem with thanksgiving and other like real meals like big meals on a cooking
[01:40:50.120 --> 01:40:54.360]   Is not so much cooking everything but making sure everything is ready for the table at the same time
[01:40:54.360 --> 01:40:56.680]   And suvide will like solve that problem
[01:40:56.680 --> 01:40:58.040]   It's like just
[01:40:58.040 --> 01:41:04.520]   If you've got some funny, duddy people who don't think you can cook to begin with don't let them see that for the last 15 minutes before dinner
[01:41:04.520 --> 01:41:08.680]   You're slipping over my bags and putting things because they'll think oh great. Oh sure
[01:41:08.680 --> 01:41:14.360]   I'm just glad you're making it. Thank god. You were not just having fruits and burritos today. Like okay
[01:41:14.360 --> 01:41:19.720]   I'll tell you how much I trust you. I'm gonna actually do this on thanksgiving. That means i'm putting my life on the line
[01:41:19.720 --> 01:41:22.520]   It's like got the family coming over
[01:41:22.520 --> 01:41:28.600]   Have a great thanksgiving and the alex lizzy same to you and you're beautiful children who were so sweet malachi and isabella
[01:41:28.600 --> 01:41:31.000]   We're in the studio on saturday for screen saver
[01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:34.760]   They were so excited to be gone. They ran home and just kept on waiting for the episode to come out
[01:41:34.760 --> 01:41:36.760]   So they can see themselves on show
[01:41:36.760 --> 01:41:39.960]   So they were you can see that twit.tv/nss
[01:41:39.960 --> 01:41:45.080]   Uh, and I think isabella had fun driving our our toy tesla. She loves driving the tesla
[01:41:45.080 --> 01:41:50.680]   Yeah, you've she told she came home and and she told she told her mom that she's like I went and drove leo's tesla
[01:41:50.680 --> 01:41:52.680]   And she's like she did what
[01:41:52.680 --> 01:42:03.560]   It was it was an autopilot mode and was only on the highway where it worked really well
[01:42:03.560 --> 01:42:13.000]   Happy thanksgiving to all of our american fans for you canadians. Well, I hope you enjoyed your thanksgiving last month
[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.960]   Uh, we will be back as we are every tuesday
[01:42:15.960 --> 01:42:19.240]   We try we relate today and I apologize. That's my fault
[01:42:20.120 --> 01:42:27.640]   We try to hit 11 a.m. Pacific 2 p.m. Eastern time that would be 1900 utc if you want to watch live twit.tv/live
[01:42:27.640 --> 01:42:34.040]   You can also subscribe actually you can download it any show you miss at twit.tv/io s
[01:42:34.040 --> 01:42:39.400]   But you can subscribe in your favorite podcast app and that way you'll always get the latest version the minute it's available
[01:42:39.400 --> 01:42:41.560]   encourage you
[01:42:41.560 --> 01:42:43.240]   To do this
[01:42:43.240 --> 01:42:48.360]   It was a tough choice. I could play the wk rp as god is my witness
[01:42:48.360 --> 01:42:50.520]   I thought turkeys could fly a bit
[01:42:50.520 --> 01:42:57.480]   But I decided no that's been done and something no one's seen before would be better. This is
[01:42:57.480 --> 01:43:02.680]   Apple's holiday message to all of you happy thanksgiving everybody. We'll see you next week
[01:43:02.680 --> 01:43:09.000]   But now it's time to get back to work because break time is almost over bye bye everybody
[01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:16.120]   Wake up and smotty coffee is your cup
[01:43:16.840 --> 01:43:25.560]   I feel a empty when we talk you say it softly, but I love it when you're awfully quiet
[01:43:25.560 --> 01:43:33.880]   You see
