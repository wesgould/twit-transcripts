[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.840]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show where we cover the latest Apple news.
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.840]   I'm liking it. It sounds like my law firm, Dow Rimple, Richie and Enocho.
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.840]   I like it. Hello, Jim Dow Rimple.
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.840]   How are ya? It's getting a little cold out there.
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.840]   Oh, you know, it is getting a little bit cold, but not as cold as it is and where Renee is.
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.840]   I know poor Renee's in Morayal, Renee Richie. Jim Dow Rimple from the Loop, Loop Insight.com.
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.840]   Renee Richie from iMore.com.
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.840]   It is getting brisk out. I will give you that. I have to shut the windows and board up the doors.
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.840]   Oh, yeah. Really board up the doors. Wow.
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.840]   I don't want to be thinking.
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.840]   When the snow melts, Leo and the pass is opening and I'll get back.
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.840]   And also from Boston, where it's probably getting a little chilly too.
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.840]   Andy and Enocho, the Chicago Sun-Time.
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.840]   Yeah, it was warmer than LA when I left and then it was colder than LA when I came back.
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.840]   Also, damn kids ripped all the trees off my oak tree and just didn't even steal them.
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.840]   It just dropped them around the floor.
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.840]   Si. Who's gonna have to pick those up?
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.840]   I'll tell you who my neighbor when I blow them into their yard and he's not going to be happy about that.
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.840]   Alex Lindsey would be happy. He was telling people, "Don't go to the first few weekends of the Steve Jobs movie."
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.840]   Apparently, people took his word and didn't.
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.840]   And it opened very, very weekly. Did you see that?
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.840]   I got a big ad blocker announcement from a cult of Mac.
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.840]   I'll have to see if I can get it again.
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.840]   It says, "We don't like ad blockers."
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:25.840]   The economist, yeah. In fact, I had a guy from the economist on the triangle issue yesterday.
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.840]   I should have asked him about that. That's not his problem.
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.840]   No. He's a senior editor there, but that's not his problem.
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.840]   Steve Jobs booted off screens.
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.840]   It's almost like the 1985 Apple board is running theaters, says Cult of Mac.
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.840]   Terrible, terrible opening weekend.
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:51.840]   The James Bond movie's specter took in $73 million in its opening weekend.
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.840]   The Jobs movie, $8,000, $23,000.
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.840]   Okay, so let's just review.
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.840]   This is a talky talky talky movie about a business executive
[00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:08.840]   going up against a James Bond movie and a Peanuts 3D animated movie.
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.840]   It wasn't fair, was it?
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.840]   It's not as though this thing was guaranteed to make its money back in a dull weekend,
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.840]   but okay, this was...
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.840]   Maybe this is more of an Oscar-qualifying run before a video release,
[00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.840]   as opposed to a money making.
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:25.840]   How does it compare to social network, though?
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.840]   That's probably a fair comparison. It's another talky talky tech leader.
[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.840]   I don't know. This was talky talkier than the social network, even.
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.840]   This was like a theater theatrical play.
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.840]   It just feels like the wrong movie. They made the wrong movie.
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.840]   They made a movie that wouldn't appeal to anybody instead of one that might even just appeal to some.
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.840]   If Steve Jobs had maybe shot some people, had maybe a little...
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.840]   If he was that... I think he did in an early draft of the script.
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:50.840]   It didn't really happen, but it was based on something that was a confirmation of the time.
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.840]   If they'd shown him interesting, the iPhone and using Snapchat,
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.840]   all the kids would have gone.
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:03.840]   The movie has earned 16.6 million so far, which is not bad,
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:09.840]   but it's barely more, according to Colton Mac, than the Ashton Kutcher movie, Choms.
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:15.840]   I think we could probably all just celebrate the failure of this movie.
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.840]   It has moved out of the theaters now.
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.840]   They took it out of more than 2,000 theaters, so it's down to a few hundred now.
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.840]   When Aaron Swerken writes the inevitable Eric Schmidt movie,
[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.840]   he needs to learn a lesson from this one.
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.840]   He's better target it to his audience.
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.840]   - Eric Schmidt movie. - So when we show it on Google Campus.
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.840]   Eric Schmidt movie.
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.840]   Will he ever write an Eric Schmidt movie?
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.840]   I think it's fairly safe to say no.
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.840]   Larry and Sergey get off Scott for eight.
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.840]   He's done Zuckerberg, he's done Steve Jobs.
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.840]   I wonder if Gates...
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:49.840]   I would go see a Gates movie, and be honest with you, if they're lies, and I wouldn't mind.
[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.840]   Right?
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.840]   Let's be honest.
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.840]   How about a version of...
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.840]   Just like this Jobs movie didn't focus on his entire life,
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.840]   just some key sequences from the life.
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:07.840]   So what if Sorkin does a Bill Gates movie based solely on his arrest for speeding,
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:11.840]   and basically we make it into a remake of "Cannibal Run 2"?
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.840]   - They can show all the CS hats. - We'll give them the mustaches.
[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.840]   Imagine the bloopers.
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.840]   I guess we'll see the CS kinos, but no one would recognize the technology he talked about.
[00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:25.840]   John C. Devorak used to take Bill Gates' keynote speeches and edit everything but the gulps out.
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.840]   And then he had a three-minute video of Bill Gates.
[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.840]   You could deny Steve Bomber three times.
[00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:39.840]   - There's a movie I wouldn't go see. - Must you betray me with a zoom?
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:45.840]   But honestly, I say that in just, but I think it really underscores the problem here.
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.840]   People did idolize Steve Jobs.
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.840]   Remember when he died?
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.840]   That was a genuine outpouring of emotion.
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:56.840]   And I don't think the same feeling about, let's say, Bill Gates.
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.840]   Nothing against Bill Gates.
[00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:03.840]   But I don't think people would be as upset about a Bill Gates movie that fudged the facts.
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.840]   So Aaron, have at it.
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:09.840]   - Well, partly because there's so much less of a mythology around Bill Gates.
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:10.840]   - Maybe. - Yeah.
[00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:16.840]   And we talked about this a little bit last week where I do think that people create fictional characters
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:18.840]   based on real people.
[00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:26.840]   And they create the version of Steve Jobs or Paul McCartney or anybody that they feel as though they need in their life.
[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:30.840]   So it was going to be a hard task no matter how they did it, I think.
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:32.840]   - Yeah. - Yep.
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:33.840]   - Yeah.
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.840]   - Did you see it, Jim? - Did you see it, Jim?
[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:38.840]   - Joshua Molina, Bill Gates, it'd be fantastic.
[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:41.840]   - Oh, perfect. - I have not.
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.840]   - Yeah, so none of you have seen it.
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:44.840]   I'm the only one who's seen it.
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:47.840]   And I can't scrape it off my eyeballs.
[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.840]   (laughs)
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:50.840]   No, you know what?
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:52.840]   It wasn't probably a bad movie.
[00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:58.840]   But it just was so hard to swallow the feeling that you felt it was doing it to serve Steve.
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.840]   - Let me ask you a question.
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:05.840]   What if it was the most thinly veiled fiction ever?
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:07.840]   Like we just--
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:08.840]   - A romance, a clef.
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:11.840]   - The exact same script, exact same everything only.
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:13.840]   Instead of Steve Jobs make a bit of a different name.
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:16.840]   Instead of the products, just make up different names for these exact same products.
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:17.840]   - That would have been great.
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:21.840]   - That then thought it would have, if it were inspired by the life of Steve Jobs, would you have enjoyed it?
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:23.840]   - Well, I think that's what they should have done.
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:24.840]   In fact, I mentioned that.
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.840]   I see a Christian called Steve Blobs or something.
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.840]   It would have been a much better movie.
[00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:33.840]   Because then you could go, "Oh, well, I understand they're not trying to do anything biographical."
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:37.840]   As much as Aaron Sorkin would say, "This is not a biopic. Not a biopic."
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:38.840]   It's a biopic.
[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:39.840]   - I'm sorry.
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:40.840]   - I agree.
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:41.840]   - Kind of like how the mic--
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:42.840]   - Go ahead.
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:43.840]   - Tomorrow.
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:45.840]   All right, we're moving on.
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:46.840]   Who cares?
[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:47.840]   It's a movie.
[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:48.840]   It's over.
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:49.840]   It's done with.
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:50.840]   Tomorrow.
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:51.840]   I went today.
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:52.840]   I'm disappointed.
[00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:57.840]   I was going to buy three iPad Pros, three pencils, three even of those dumb keyboards.
[00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.840]   - [laughs]
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:00.840]   - But I couldn't.
[00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:01.840]   - No, tomorrow.
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:02.840]   - Tomorrow.
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:03.840]   - You can order tomorrow.
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:04.840]   You can't buy tomorrow.
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:05.840]   - It's official.
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:07.840]   It's been Apple put out a press release.
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:08.840]   It's not a rumor anymore.
[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.840]   But in the press release, I don't think they said 1201 Pacific.
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:13.840]   Did they say anything?
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:14.840]   - No.
[00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:15.840]   - It's like Apple TV.
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.840]   It'll kind of happen during the day when it happens.
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:18.840]   - Dang it.
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:19.840]   - It wouldn't be, though.
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.840]   It won't be one of those things where if you didn't get it in the first 10 minutes, you'll have
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.840]   to wait three months, right?
[00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:27.840]   - Maybe because I don't know if anybody would want the 32 gig version.
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:31.840]   And if you want 128 gig, and you want to have it this week, I would make it.
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:36.840]   I would make a pot of coffee and stay up just in case it goes on sale at 1201 Eastern.
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:40.840]   - Or three a.m. Eastern, Andy.
[00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:46.840]   - Well, just what if they were to say that people in Boston actually matter?
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:47.840]   - Okay.
[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:49.840]   - We got rid of B-Mug.
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:52.840]   - We got a rat rid of Mackerel Boston.
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:54.840]   We sure as hell not going to change us.
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:55.840]   - Oh, yeah, Michael, there's a 3 a.m.
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:56.840]   That's hard.
[00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:58.840]   - Like the Apple TV, I was up at 3 a.
[00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:02.840]   Well, I was in the West Coast, but I was still up at midnight at 1230.
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:06.840]   I had alarms set for every 30 minutes, and it ended up being like 530 in the morning that
[00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:07.840]   I finally went on sale.
[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:11.840]   - And I was sitting in a room with the Apple people, and we were saying, no, not yet.
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:13.840]   Well, Renee, get up another hour.
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:15.840]   - It was just you.
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:17.840]   - It was you.
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:18.840]   - It was you.
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:20.840]   - When the high-name is ran out, he finally pressed the button.
[00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:25.840]   - Renee just tweeted, "I hate to step away from the computer, but I really have to go to
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:26.840]   the bathroom."
[00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:27.840]   Okay, no, no, no.
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:28.840]   - Yeah.
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:29.840]   [laughter]
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:36.840]   - He's taken way too much joy in this.
[00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:37.840]   - Yeah.
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:39.840]   Way too much pleasure in this.
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:44.840]   - I'm not glad you're finally glad you may have that joke.
[00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:47.240]   - Well, do you know anything, Jim?
[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:49.840]   Have you heard from sources?
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:56.840]   - No, I mean, it's kind of a strange thing, because when they launch these pre-orders,
[00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:58.840]   typically they sell out.
[00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:00.840]   So then you end up waiting.
[00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:07.840]   That even happened with iPhone, if you remember back a few years ago when they decided to do
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:14.840]   iPhone pre-orders instead of having people line up at the stores, then you had to wait
[00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:15.840]   for quite a while.
[00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:17.840]   Watch was the same thing.
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:18.840]   - Right.
[00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:25.840]   - But iPad hasn't been selling as well as all of their other products, and there hasn't
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:29.840]   been the demand for iPad that there has been for their other products.
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:35.840]   So that's going to be the interesting part about the whole pre-order thing.
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:43.840]   Is the iPad Pro enough of a draw that it's going to sell out on the pre-orders, or are
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:45.840]   you going to have the pre-orders?
[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:48.840]   Those are delivered, and people can still go to the stores and buy it.
[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:53.840]   I mean, you know, there's a whole -- a lot of things that we don't know, like what the
[00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:56.840]   supply is of these things and everything else.
[00:11:56.840 --> 00:12:02.840]   But, you know, having used it, I think it's going to do pretty well.
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:07.840]   - I think the people who want it are going to be really super motivated to get it early.
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:11.840]   But the question is whether there's going to be enough people who want to get an $800
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:15.840]   13-inch tablet that it would create a run on demand.
[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:20.840]   I mean, I didn't -- I didn't stay up late to buy the Apple TV pre-order as soon as it
[00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:24.840]   went live, but I -- a couple days later, I thought, eh, maybe it would be nice to have
[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:28.840]   one place the order at like 8.30 in the morning, and by the time I got to the store,
[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:29.840]   it was ready to be picked up.
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:33.840]   - So many people are so angry who pre-ordered the Apple TV, and it got it later than it was
[00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:34.840]   available in stores.
[00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:36.840]   So it'll be interesting to see if people know -- no, I'm not going to pre-order it.
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.840]   I'm going to go to the store on Thursday or Friday.
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:41.840]   - Yeah, that's weird how they're not being really specific about it.
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:45.840]   I have -- I really do -- for professional reasons, as well as personal reasons,
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:47.840]   I do want to have it, like, as quickly as I can have it.
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:48.840]   - Right.
[00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:53.840]   - So that means pre-order -- order it online and then have it shipped, or whether that just
[00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:59.840]   simply means, again, wait until 12.01 a.m. on the day it's supposed to drop in stores,
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:02.840]   and then just simply pick it up in person.
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:08.840]   - I -- I'm going to make a prediction that it will be quickly out of stock only because
[00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:13.840]   it's -- I think Apple would love to prove that, yeah, there's been dwindling interest
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:14.840]   in the iPad.
[00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:17.840]   That's only because everybody has one, but there's going to be huge interest in a new
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:19.840]   form factor, 12.9 inch iPad.
[00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:25.840]   So one way or the other, whether it's inadequate stock or excessive demand, one way or the other,
[00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:28.840]   I think it's going to be hard to get after the first day or two.
[00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:29.840]   - Yeah.
[00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:32.840]   - It's going to be -- - I guess it's also -- even because it's hard -- it's hard to make -- it's
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:35.840]   got so much technology inside of it that it's probably -- and it's the first run,
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:39.840]   and there's almost always constraints on the first run of something that uses new screen technology
[00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:41.840]   and new input technology and all those things.
[00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:42.840]   - Yeah.
[00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:46.840]   - On top of that, I bet they don't -- I bet they don't know how -- what the demand is going to be.
[00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:49.840]   I really don't know if they have any real guesses.
[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:54.840]   I tend to think it's an urban myth that Apple intentionally constrains shipments
[00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:59.840]   of the first iPhones, but maybe -- I don't think they're constraining, but maybe they're saying
[00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:05.840]   if we have a little too few, better to say that we've sold out and people have to wait a week
[00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:08.840]   than have so many sitting by the docks that --
[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:09.840]   - That's the worst.
[00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:12.840]   - We try not to explain why they're all at Best Buy and not --
[00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:14.840]   - It changes the playbooks.
[00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:15.840]   - Yeah.
[00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:18.840]   - They absolutely don't want to have a bunch in the store window, right?
[00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:19.840]   - Yeah.
[00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:25.840]   - I mean, yeah, I don't want to be cynical or anything, but Apple's not immune to marketing,
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:30.840]   and perception would be very good for this to sell out quickly would be very good.
[00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:32.840]   So -- and maybe it is hard to make.
[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:34.840]   Why would it be hard to make?
[00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:38.840]   - Well, it's not that it's hard -- a lot of the stuff that Apple makes is not -- they don't just buy
[00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:39.840]   components off the shelves.
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:42.840]   They design the stuff that makes the stuff that they put in these products.
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:43.840]   - Right.
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:47.840]   - So we've seen that with retina displays, and we've seen that with, you know, with touch ID sensors,
[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:52.840]   and we've seen that with A-8 processors, that getting the stuff in sufficient quantity and yield,
[00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:56.840]   we've talked with the Apple Watch where they had to throw out tons of them because they just couldn't
[00:14:56.840 --> 00:15:01.840]   produce them in sufficient quantities with sufficient reliability with the Taptic Engines at first.
[00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:07.840]   So making something that the screen here is much bigger than before, it's got twice the amount of resolution
[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:12.840]   for the touch input as before, it's got to work with the pencil, it's got an A9X processor in it,
[00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:14.840]   and it's got to work with the Apple Watch.
[00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:17.840]   - So it's just the opportunity for Apple to make tons and tons of these and have a super high yield rate.
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:18.840]   It's not great.
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:25.840]   - Tim Cook in an interview with the Telegraph in England said, "I think if you're looking at a PC,
[00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:28.840]   why would you buy a PC anymore?"
[00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:33.840]   This is from Tom Warren, who covers, by the way, Windows for the Verge.
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:38.840]   He says, "No, really," Tim Cook says, "Why would you buy one?
[00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:41.840]   Is the iPad Pro a replacement for a notebook?"
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:43.840]   Wait, I guess we don't know till we get one.
[00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:45.840]   Seems to me it is not just because of the software.
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:46.840]   You need to have--
[00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:52.840]   - I don't think there's anything out there that's a replacement for the PC right now
[00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:56.840]   because I don't think that we're ready to take that step.
[00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:03.840]   And it's funny, the people that are taking that step are elderly people and younger people,
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:04.840]   like kids.
[00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:07.840]   They're the ones that are taking that step because they're the ones that
[00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:15.840]   don't want to have to deal with all the problems that we associate with PCs.
[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:20.840]   And when you look at what the iPad offers, it's a very simple interface.
[00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:24.840]   It's touch, which is why kids can outperform any adult.
[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:25.840]   - Yes.
[00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:30.840]   - They just sit down and start touching and they automatically know what's going to happen.
[00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:36.840]   And that's why those two groups of people are really excelling at using these products.
[00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:40.840]   And the rest of us are kind of stuck in this group and it is the majority,
[00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:46.840]   are kind of stuck in this group of we still need our PCs, we still need our Macs,
[00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:55.840]   and we'll use these as an add-on, a complimentary type of device that we can still use on a daily basis.
[00:16:55.840 --> 00:17:00.840]   So until that changes, and I don't think that's coming anytime soon,
[00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:08.840]   you know, iPads, tablets, all of that stuff are kind of, they're going to be a second-class citizen.
[00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:09.840]   - Renee?
[00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:11.840]   - Yeah, it's one of those statements that it's bombastic.
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:13.840]   It's like, "Oh, no, he didn't say that."
[00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:14.840]   - Oh, no, you didn't.
[00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:16.840]   - But it's what gets a lot of attention.
[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:19.840]   The thing is though that when they're referring to PC, my belief is that he's talking about Windows.
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:24.840]   He's not really talking about Macs because Apple does Mac versus PC and things like that all the time.
[00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:25.840]   - I think you're right.
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:28.840]   - And he said that he only traveled with iPad Pro and an iPhone right now,
[00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:31.840]   but beyond that, there is still an incredible amount of people.
[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:35.840]   I mean, you walk into a Best Buy, and you walk out with a PC, and you don't know how.
[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:39.840]   Like, if you're brand new to computing, whether you're young or old, they don't teach you how to use it.
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:42.840]   It's like being given someone a car without any driving lessons, and it sits there,
[00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:47.840]   and you try to do stuff, and you call your neighbor's kid for help, and it's a very frustrating, inaccessible experience,
[00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:51.840]   even for really smart people who just aren't attuned to technology.
[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:55.840]   And exactly to Jim's point, from the beginning, the iPad was supposed to be, you know,
[00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:58.840]   the job set was one of the most important things he ever worked on,
[00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:03.840]   and that's for a man who spent his entire career trying to democratize in mainstream technology.
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:07.840]   They want to make something that's super accessible, that's approachable, that's not intimidating,
[00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:13.840]   that maybe doesn't do as much as a giant honking PC, but lets you do more with it than you'd be able to do with one of those.
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:17.840]   I think this, because of the pencil, because of the keyboard, because of the size,
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:22.840]   they feel like it's their best shot yet at replacing a laptop or a netbook or a notebook,
[00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:26.840]   or one of those kinds of computers for a large amount of mainstream people.
[00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:27.840]   - Yeah.
[00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:39.840]   - I think I can see Jim's point with traveling, because these days, I often will just travel with an iPad and a phone,
[00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:46.840]   but, you know, Apple has made the 12 inch MacBooks so good and so thin and so light,
[00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:50.840]   that it's nothing just to throw that in the bag, just in case I need it,
[00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:55.840]   and that's getting back to the whole problem that I was talking about before.
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:19:03.840]   I will take that computer if I'm going away for three or four days, well, you never know.
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:09.840]   I might need to actually sit down and dig into some work, and I'll just throw it in the bag.
[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:18.840]   Chances are, when I do go, I don't use it because Dave Merck and Sean King,
[00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:22.840]   Dave's doing a terrific job on the site when I'm not around,
[00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:27.840]   so, you know, he looks after all the stuff that needs to be looked after,
[00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:29.840]   but it's still the mindset.
[00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:32.840]   If I'm going to need to do that real work, I better throw it in there,
[00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:35.840]   even though I can do a lot of it on the iPad.
[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:36.840]   - Andy?
[00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:44.840]   - Yeah, I mean, it's kind of like getting astronauts 95% of the way back to Earth.
[00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:46.840]   You don't get credit for that.
[00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:55.840]   And in so many ways, I think that right now an iPad is about 90% what a notebook is,
[00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:59.840]   but those times where I've got a file, I need to get it on the device.
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:01.840]   It's too much of a pain in the butt still.
[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:05.840]   And given that Apple is also really explicitly saying,
[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:09.840]   "Here is the sort of keyboard that we envision iPad users using,"
[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:12.840]   and it's, I think I want to reach over and get it,
[00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:15.840]   but it's a fabric covered, mechanical key switches,
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:23.840]   but really flat fabric covered bumps that are okay if you're trying to avoid typing on things.
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:27.840]   But if you, so much of work, when you're sitting down for more than a couple hours,
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:28.840]   it really is.
[00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:33.840]   I got a type and I need a way to, I need a trackpad, I need a mouse,
[00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:35.840]   and it's just not useful for that sort of stuff.
[00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:38.840]   I mean, we all, I think we all on this panel go through that.
[00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:41.840]   Every single time we pack for a trip, I was packing for it.
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:44.840]   I once took an iPad with me for one entire week in Ireland,
[00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:46.840]   and it was just fine.
[00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:50.840]   Last week, however, I was in LA for six days.
[00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:52.840]   There are a couple of things I needed to do,
[00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:57.840]   and it was just those two things, maybe less than 90 minutes worth of actual stuff
[00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:00.840]   that made me bring my 13-inch MacBook.
[00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:06.840]   And like Jim said, it's, it was a, the decision to take my iPad for a week in Ireland was back,
[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:10.840]   and was made back when my MacBook was 15 inches instead of 13.
[00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:15.840]   And even the MacBook Pro, it's a lot heavier than an iPad,
[00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:18.840]   but it's not so much bigger and heavier than I wouldn't think of taking it.
[00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:21.840]   So I think that when I heard that when I read that quote,
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:24.840]   it's obvious the sort of fire that you throw when you're being interviewed ahead
[00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:27.840]   of a major launch that you're hoping big things for.
[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:31.840]   But I did see it as specifically a broad side against Microsoft Surface.
[00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:36.840]   I think they're saying that they're aware that that surface is a tablet that's about the size
[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:40.840]   of an iPad Pro, costs about as much as an iPad Pro, and they're saying,
[00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:42.840]   "Well, why would you want it to be a PC?
[00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:46.840]   Wouldn't you want every advantage you can possibly get of having a multi-touch tablet?"
[00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:48.840]   And for them, that's an iPad.
[00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:49.840]   Here's the quote.
[00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:55.840]   " iPad Pro is, quote, a replacement for a notebook or a desktop for lots of people.
[00:21:55.840 --> 00:22:00.840]   They will start using it and conclude they no longer need to use anything else other than their phones."
[00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:04.840]   I think, though, there may be an issue with the iPad Pro in that context.
[00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:08.840]   Don't you really want software that's designed for the iPad Pro?
[00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:10.840]   Or is that not the case?
[00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:11.840]   I think that'll pass.
[00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:15.840]   Yeah, but I mean, right now, I'm not going to be able to buy an iPad Pro
[00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:18.840]   and then leave my computer at home.
[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:19.840]   There's a bunch of good stuff.
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:21.840]   Like the Office apps are being updated.
[00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:23.840]   Adobe's already got some great updates.
[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:24.840]   Procreate's been updated.
[00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:25.840]   Paper.
[00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:27.840]   I forget the name of the app.
[00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:28.840]   It's already with the software.
[00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:31.840]   So I saw paper's been updated to give you a bigger canvas.
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:33.840]   What happens if you use the old paper?
[00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:36.840]   On the 12.9 inch iPad Pro, does it just look small?
[00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:37.840]   Yeah, it just scales up.
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:44.840]   It's kind of like the iPhone iPad thing where if it wasn't designed for the iPad, it looks like an iPhone app.
[00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:47.840]   The better analogy is when they wear you to iPhone 6.
[00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:48.840]   Okay.
[00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:50.840]   And the bigger screen, you just blue stuff up.
[00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:54.840]   So it will fill the 12.9 inches, but it will look funky because it's going to be big.
[00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:55.840]   Yeah, it's still four by three.
[00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:56.840]   Yeah.
[00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:57.840]   Go ahead.
[00:22:57.840 --> 00:22:58.840]   I'm sorry, Jim.
[00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:04.840]   Yeah, it's not going to look crazy, like stupid when the app blows up.
[00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:12.840]   But clearly, like Renee said, you know, it's going to be a lot better once the apps are made for the iPad Pro.
[00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:20.840]   And I think one of the things it's not once the apps are made, it's going to be when we figure out what apps we want to be made.
[00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:22.840]   You know, that's going to be the big thing.
[00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:26.840]   Is this iPad Pro going to be a big graphics thing?
[00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:28.840]   I think clearly it will be.
[00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:30.840]   But what are the other uses?
[00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:32.840]   You know, Microsoft is in on this.
[00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:34.840]   So they're making apps.
[00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:38.840]   So productivity is obviously going to be a great thing too.
[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:44.840]   It's just the level of where we're going to go with this new product.
[00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:47.840]   I think that is going to determine a lot for us.
[00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:52.840]   Tom Warren says there's the unavoidable truth that tablets aren't replacing PCs yet.
[00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:58.840]   Apple's latest financial results says Mac sales up 3% iPad sales down nearly 20%.
[00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:03.840]   Tim Cook and DrumUp interested in the iPad Pro all day long, but Apple's giant tablet.
[00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:08.840]   I noticed the surface is not a giant tablet, but Apple was a giant tablet.
[00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:10.840]   That's your alternative not to try.
[00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:12.840]   I mean, it's the same thing with Microsoft the surface.
[00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:13.840]   I like that they're trying this.
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:16.840]   I saw the they were talking about the code app yesterday from panic.
[00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:18.840]   And that app has been updated.
[00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:20.840]   One of the big differences now is their size classes.
[00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:26.840]   So even though it's not exactly made for iPad Pro, it'll still adapt to it and code had made it for iPad Pro.
[00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:32.840]   So you have not only the split view and all the multitasking, but you can put Safari in on one side and code on the other.
[00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:36.840]   And it'll push live updates to Safari while you're coding in the other side.
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:37.840]   And that kind of stuff is terrific.
[00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:40.840]   And we're going to just see more and more of those kind of clever implementations.
[00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:41.840]   He brings up the angle issue.
[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:47.840]   He says they're not paying attention to what Microsoft has learned from surface because surface was a failure at first, especially surface artsy.
[00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:53.840]   For one thing, the angle, they only had one angle in the original Surface Pro for the screen.
[00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:55.840]   And he says, Apple's got the same problem.
[00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:57.840]   You put that keyboard on its one angle.
[00:24:57.840 --> 00:24:58.840]   That's third party keyboards.
[00:24:58.840 --> 00:24:59.840]   They'll have any angle they want.
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:00.840]   That's the big difference.
[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:03.840]   The key the kickstand on the surface was built into the surface.
[00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:06.840]   So you can have any angle you want.
[00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:07.840]   Do you think we'll need a key?
[00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:08.840]   Should I buy the keyboard?
[00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:09.840]   I really don't like that.
[00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:10.840]   Fabulous.
[00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:11.840]   I don't think so.
[00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:12.840]   No.
[00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:17.840]   I've had some time with the iPad Pro.
[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:19.840]   I've not had any time with this keyboard.
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:25.840]   But like I said, I've had experience with keyboards that are almost exactly like that based on the technology.
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:34.840]   And I've tried to do an entire day's work on them, but I have failed to do so because it's just not comfortable.
[00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:37.840]   I mean, you really do want comfort, not convenience.
[00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:44.840]   And I'm sure that Logitech and other companies are going to fill the void and give you something akin to a real keyboard.
[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:51.840]   Logitech has already announced something called the Create for iPad Pro that uses that connector on the bottom.
[00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:59.840]   That's a great thing that we have all of these third party companies that are coming out with apps and coming out with accessories and things like that.
[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:01.840]   And Apple opens up the market for that.
[00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:02.840]   Right.
[00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:03.840]   So it's a great thing.
[00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:04.840]   So defer.
[00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:05.840]   Yeah.
[00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:08.840]   I mean, what is how much is the Apple keyboard? 100 bucks, 120 bucks.
[00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:09.840]   100, 20 bucks.
[00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:15.840]   And if you look at someone like Federico Vitichy from Mac Stories who just lives on the iPad, he does everything on the iPad and he is a high functioning nerd.
[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:18.840]   Like he's doing Python and he's doing scripts and all sorts of automation.
[00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:20.840]   And I don't think he's ever going to go back.
[00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:24.840]   So there's clearly it depends on your work style as much as anything else.
[00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:26.840]   You definitely want the pencil though, right?
[00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:27.840]   Even if I'm not, I'm no artist.
[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:28.840]   So great.
[00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:29.840]   So great.
[00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:30.840]   Would I become an artist?
[00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:31.840]   Will I be a better drawer?
[00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:32.840]   It's like the Matrix.
[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:34.840]   It plugs into you and makes you an artist.
[00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:51.840]   One of the things that really attracts me to the iPad Pro is that idea that, you know, you, you, I don't travel with drawing tools because same reason why I didn't used to travel with big heavy books because the enjoyment I get out of them is disproportionate to the pain of the butt of actually
[00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:52.840]   hauling them around.
[00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:57.840]   But when you now have a tablet, a device that is a great drawing device, yes, you will take it out and draw.
[00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:06.840]   I was at the LA County Art Museum and there are a couple of galleries where the art is owned by private people and they don't allow photography and this beautiful gallery Picasso.
[00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:08.840]   It's like his entire career in there.
[00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:12.840]   And I wanted to, I wanted to remember what that was like.
[00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:16.840]   So that's part of my time stream when I go back later on and also I wanted to remember what it was.
[00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:17.840]   I liked about it.
[00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:19.840]   And so I had my iPad mini with me and I just took it out.
[00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:25.840]   I took out paper and I drew what I drew my own version of this one particular Picasso.
[00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:28.840]   And I think that's going to encourage a lot more people to do stuff like that.
[00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:37.840]   If it costs $99 to have this beautiful art kit in addition to whatever app they're running on the iPad Pro, it might make them not even professional artists.
[00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:39.840]   I don't think Apple has ever really been keen.
[00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:44.840]   I don't think this ever been Apple's point to say if you're a professional artist, you'll find this a great professional tool.
[00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:51.840]   I think Apple's point has always been we will make you want to take more pictures by giving you a camera that really works great and it's easy to get great results from.
[00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:54.840]   I think this is like the iPhone camera only with art.
[00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:56.840]   You caught me into it.
[00:27:56.840 --> 00:28:03.840]   There's a company called the IVSO that is selling a keyboard.
[00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:05.840]   There are a number of keyboards actually.
[00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:06.840]   I'm kind of impressed with this.
[00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:08.840]   This is the 1990.
[00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:09.840]   I don't know if this is any good.
[00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:11.840]   I don't know if the angle is adjustable.
[00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:13.840]   Do I want to have an adjustable one?
[00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:14.840]   This is Bluetooth by the way.
[00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:17.840]   It does not like the Logitech use that connector.
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:20.840]   You want sometimes my experience with my own iPad.
[00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:27.840]   Sometimes you do want a little bit of adjustability if only to avoid glare when you're sitting in a specific place that you can't move from.
[00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:29.840]   It gives you some flexibility there.
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:36.840]   Again, based on my experience, I think that my favorite answer will be just to have an external keyboard.
[00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:41.840]   A really good portable Bluetooth keyboard full-size, full-stroke keys.
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:46.840]   If I really want this to be a cool one of a notebook, it is sad but true.
[00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:51.840]   I can spend $40 on a Bluetooth keyboard and I'll have better keys than I have on my MacBook Pro.
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:52.840]   Yeah.
[00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:54.840]   Or let's keep my phone more comfortable.
[00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:55.840]   Or an Apple keyboard.
[00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:57.840]   I have an extra magic keyboard.
[00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:05.840]   The order that I'm at for Lisa's office, she has her own wired mouse and keyboard.
[00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:09.840]   I said, "Oh, good. Put the magic keyboard and the new mouse in there."
[00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:11.840]   You get that with the thing.
[00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:12.840]   I'll have a magic keyboard.
[00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:14.840]   Maybe I'll just use the magic keyboard for it.
[00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:19.840]   I hope they make a version like the typo keyboard as much as we made fun of their Blackberry-style iPhone thing.
[00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:22.840]   The typo keyboard for the iPad was great and it had a very, very good hinge on it.
[00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:25.840]   I'm hoping there'll be a lot of good options.
[00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:31.840]   Zag is going to make a keyboard for the Pro. That'll be $140.
[00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:33.840]   I'm looking at this as an article in Digital Trans.
[00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:35.840]   They have a number of these.
[00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:37.840]   The iconic Pro iPad Pro case.
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:41.840]   A lot of these are cases with Bluetooth keyboards in it and then, of course, the Logitech.
[00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:47.840]   I don't like those designs only because it throws away the greatest advantage of having this tablet,
[00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:56.840]   which is the times when you don't need a keyboard, now you've got this really thick and clunky and bulky thing that's for $20 coated and vinyl.
[00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:58.840]   So is your advice to wait?
[00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:04.840]   I would say definitely if you really want something, you're going to be using it as a laptop replacement.
[00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:13.840]   I would say definitely the stopgap measure would be to get a Logitech when I recommended last week the camera.
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:18.840]   I think it's the 830, but you can get these for $50 and they work great.
[00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:20.840]   And a compass stand.
[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:25.840]   I intend for that to be my main writing kit for this thing.
[00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:33.840]   And then in about six to ten months, you will see a lot of great options that will turn into a notebook sort of a fair for when you really want it to be a notebook.
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:37.840]   Who of you, Jim, I don't know, is just run off.
[00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:39.840]   But...
[00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:40.840]   Heineken Truck came by.
[00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:41.840]   The Heineken Truck came by.
[00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:43.840]   Dan Raccoon.
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:46.840]   Raccoon took his power adapter.
[00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:52.840]   In that neighborhood, the Heineken Truck comes around and has a little ring ring, tingle dingle song.
[00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:55.840]   The Heineken Man is here.
[00:30:55.840 --> 00:31:01.840]   Who of you will use the iPad Pro's?
[00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:02.840]   Oh, I will.
[00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:06.840]   The entire time I have it until I get a review finish, I'm going to entirely even on it.
[00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:08.840]   It feels like you have to.
[00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:11.840]   There are a lot of iPad Pro stands already out.
[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:13.840]   Look, I did the MacBook review only on the MacBook.
[00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:17.840]   I think it's kind of important to get proof that you're using it.
[00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:19.840]   It's not just the size of the screen, too.
[00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:22.840]   It's also iOS 9, the ability to do side-by-side stuff.
[00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:26.840]   I've been using that kind of setup on Windows 8 and Windows 10 for a while.
[00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:27.840]   And I think it works really well.
[00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:32.840]   It really is for mobile.
[00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:37.840]   It keeps the clean interface of a one-screen, one app sort of work setup while still being
[00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:39.840]   able to actually get work done.
[00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:42.840]   I will tell you something.
[00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:46.840]   There was an incident in LA last week that ended.
[00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:48.840]   Did you get married?
[00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:49.840]   New.
[00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:54.840]   I married to my genius, just like Sherlock Holmes.
[00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:58.840]   That's a 5% solution I'll get you nowhere.
[00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:01.840]   It's a contentious relationship, but we sometimes make it work.
[00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:05.840]   We oftentimes have to spend some time apart, sometimes extended time apart.
[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:06.840]   Working.
[00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:09.840]   Something happened in LA.
[00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:15.840]   The short version of it is that in my hotel room, I managed to destroy my two-year-old
[00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:16.840]   MacBook.
[00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:17.840]   Oh, dear.
[00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:19.840]   And this happened at like two in the morning.
[00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:20.840]   Oh, no.
[00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:24.840]   I had a long, long work day ahead of me and tried to fix it, tried to fix it.
[00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:30.840]   It was clear that if I could get it working again, it would not be a good productive machine
[00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:31.840]   anyway.
[00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:35.840]   And so as I'm trying to, there was an Apple Store literally a 10-minute walk away from
[00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:36.840]   the hotel.
[00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:41.840]   So I could have a brand new MacBook in five, as soon as the store opened at 10.
[00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:45.840]   And so given that I couldn't get it any earlier than that, I had some time for quite
[00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:46.840]   contemplation.
[00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:51.840]   And after you destroy a $1,500 notebook computer that was in mind shape, it does put you in
[00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:54.600]   a contemplative mood, shall we say.
[00:32:54.600 --> 00:33:00.600]   And it did occur to me that, well, boy, I was going to buy the Sandy Bridge version of
[00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:04.440]   this next year anyway, because I usually get between two or three years of life out of
[00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:05.880]   all my MacBooks.
[00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:09.800]   But what if the iPad Pro is definitely shipping next week?
[00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:15.080]   What if we were to try without, because we will not have an option like Cortez burning
[00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:16.080]   his ships?
[00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:21.400]   What if when we buy an iPad Pro next week, and that is our only notebook until Sandy Bridge
[00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:22.640]   ships?
[00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:26.000]   And boy, it was a long thought process.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:32.200]   I decided finally that I didn't, given that I had to record a podcast at 11 in the morning,
[00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:37.440]   and I had to give a presentation, I was at MacTech to deliver the closing keynote on Friday.
[00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:44.480]   I thought that I don't want to get all those things done on my iPad mini, which was the
[00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:47.640]   only computer that I, only on the computer I had.
[00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:48.640]   But it was tempting.
[00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:50.640]   And I thought I think that it could work out that way.
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:52.960]   So the intention was there.
[00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:57.840]   I finally decided that I know this.
[00:33:57.840 --> 00:33:59.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.160]   What happened?
[00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:06.920]   Well, well, actually, more importantly, well, what happened and then what did you buy?
[00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:07.920]   Okay.
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:14.440]   Well, in my, I have to say this that in my defense, I have owned Mac books and power books since
[00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:15.440]   the PowerBook 100.
[00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:16.440]   This is bad.
[00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:23.640]   When you begin with in my defense, I know I know I'm still, so it's not, so it's not
[00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:26.440]   as though I'm careless with my, with my toys.
[00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:27.440]   Okay.
[00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:32.200]   And so this is the first kill I've ever done on, on a machine.
[00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:36.640]   So it's like a lot of conferences where like you're busy at the conference until like through
[00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:40.760]   dinner, as a matter of fact, there was an outing to go see the Steve Jobs movie and then
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:42.280]   have a discussion after that.
[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:45.600]   And I begged off of that one after dinner because I knew that I'm too tired.
[00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:48.520]   I need to get three or four hours of work done and I'm already like half asleep.
[00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:53.240]   So I decided that I go back to my room, decide that I got three or four hours of work ahead
[00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:55.600]   of me, but I just need to relax a little bit.
[00:34:55.600 --> 00:35:03.600]   So I will just get into bed, answer my email and have a beverage, a beautiful cold glass
[00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:05.960]   of Diet Dr. Pepper.
[00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:08.560]   You got you're in this huge Kingsley again in my defense.
[00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:10.600]   I've done this for years.
[00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:12.440]   Huge king size hotel bed.
[00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:14.520]   They're about on the more scale.
[00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:20.000]   They're about as little bit softer than talc as far as like firmness goes.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.880]   I had the drink on a big tray.
[00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:25.840]   It was off to my left off way, way to the side.
[00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:28.720]   And I was like on my side answering my email.
[00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:37.040]   What happened was I had, I fell asleep unexpectedly at 9 30 woke up at 2 a.m. wondering why my
[00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:39.240]   Mac book wasn't screen was dark.
[00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:41.120]   The keyboard was dry.
[00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:42.120]   Everything was dry.
[00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:47.400]   It took a while for me to work out that, oh, the keyboard of the Mac book is dry, but underneath
[00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:53.200]   the Mac, there's a there's a wet spot underneath the area of that MacBook that goes through
[00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:58.080]   that thick hotel comforter and all the way through to the sheet underneath.
[00:35:58.080 --> 00:35:59.080]   And you fell asleep.
[00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:04.520]   So there was no like I fell asleep and I knocked the drink up apparently on top of the keyboard
[00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:09.240]   and then of course, the four hours it just saturated everything and then dried.
[00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:13.400]   I finally, after a couple hours of work, managed to get it to the point where it would I would
[00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:18.360]   get a startup chime, but that's all this device was capable of doing, just recycling the startup
[00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:21.720]   chime over and over and over again.
[00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:22.720]   I did bring it home.
[00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:23.720]   I'm going to try to clean it.
[00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:25.200]   I'm going to see if I can get it working again.
[00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:30.200]   But obviously once you've dumped soda into the keyboard, that keyboard shot and you know,
[00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:32.480]   maybe I can use it as a Bluetooth device.
[00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:35.400]   So, so like I said, it was an accident.
[00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:41.200]   Maybe I will reconsider my having beverages in bed policy.
[00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:46.560]   But fortunately, I let my last full backup was like the day before I'd left for this
[00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:50.560]   trip, everything that I'd done since then was on Dropbox.
[00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:52.480]   There was zero data loss.
[00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:58.640]   It was only I was only out my dignity and $2,000 for a new Mac book.
[00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:00.560]   So you got a pro?
[00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:05.720]   I did get just I replaced it as as I got a 13 inch Mac book pro.
[00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:07.120]   Nice computer.
[00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:09.760]   I know it's it's an ice computer, but it has all those connectors.
[00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:11.280]   It makes me feel so good.
[00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:12.280]   Yeah.
[00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:16.920]   I mean, I can't yeah, I've tried to get into the heirs, but they're just not they're just
[00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:22.080]   not the for some reason they're just not the environment that lends itself to to to do
[00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:23.080]   some work.
[00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:27.240]   Also, it's hard to I don't think it's I don't think you're required to have a retina screen,
[00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:32.040]   but once you are have spent two years as with a retina screen as your primary screen,
[00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:33.680]   that's really, really hard.
[00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:38.920]   And I did again, when maybe the reason why I'm so philosophical about this was that I
[00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:40.360]   do drive a really old car.
[00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:46.200]   I'm used to the idea of spending 45 minutes by the side of the road instead of three hours
[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:47.800]   at a library working.
[00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:53.800]   And then I get a toe to the garage and told that the your car needs $540 worth of new
[00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:55.800]   all's tenators and stuff to get it working again.
[00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:58.400]   And you say, okay, well, I need to I want my car running again.
[00:37:58.400 --> 00:37:59.920]   So that's that's what happens.
[00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:01.600]   And also now I have forced touch.
[00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:02.600]   That's great.
[00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:03.600]   Now I have a 10 hour battery.
[00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:04.600]   That's great.
[00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:06.880]   Now I have to a faster generation processor.
[00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:07.880]   That's great.
[00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:12.680]   And also I've managed to solve the single greatest source of pain I had with that 2013
[00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:13.680]   MacBook.
[00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:18.320]   I cheaped out and got a 256 gig SSD and boy, I did not make that same mistake.
[00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:19.320]   Yeah.
[00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:20.320]   Yeah.
[00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:21.320]   I have a 512 gig.
[00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:23.280]   Nice to see that speed in space.
[00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:26.200]   So do you want to do an experiment with the old one like try running it through the dish
[00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:27.520]   washer just to see?
[00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:33.800]   No, but what I'm going to do is see this is as I as I as I joked the other good thing
[00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:37.240]   is that this gave me a killer 15 minute open for my closing keynote.
[00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:43.920]   So as I as I said, as I said to the people at Mac tech, I was I'm like CNN or Fox news
[00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:50.360]   and that I have an opportunity to take tragedy and monetize it.
[00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:55.920]   So step to step one was using that as my opening for my keynote to a group of mostly
[00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:57.840]   a couple hundred I T people.
[00:38:57.840 --> 00:39:02.760]   But also it means that okay, I'll write a sometimes column about how I broke it and why
[00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:04.760]   it was all okay because I had backups.
[00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:10.280]   And then once I have collected myself a little bit, I of course I brought the the remains
[00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:12.520]   home with me as my check bag.
[00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:19.000]   I'm going to take it apart and I'm going to see if I can clean it up the the running stuff
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:23.120]   through dishwasher was was a pro was a good solution like in the 90s.
[00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:24.800]   But now that everything is surface mount.
[00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:29.920]   I used to fix like old motherboards, but not fixed, but clean old motherboards that way.
[00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:35.120]   But that's the final pyre Andy put it on a boat with a blade and let it go.
[00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:38.080]   But what I'm going to do is I'm going to take it all apart and never act actually never
[00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:43.640]   taken a a unibody Mac book completely apart down to the frame before.
[00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:45.120]   So that'll be a little bit of adventure.
[00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:46.120]   Oh, yeah, take pictures.
[00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:47.120]   That'll be fun.
[00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:48.120]   That's all I'll do.
[00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:49.440]   And also I'm going to clean everything with distilled water.
[00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:52.400]   You don't use tap water because it's got mineral and stuff in it and contact.
[00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:56.920]   You could probably use contact cleaner if you don't mind the info running the environment.
[00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:57.920]   We'll find out now.
[00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:04.840]   So I'll go and this week subconsciously intellectually co sponsored by I fix it because I'll have
[00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:07.720]   to I'll have their tear down died guy.
[00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:11.400]   I'm hoping that I can get it working again so that I can at least have it in the office
[00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:16.360]   even though even if the trackpad is shot, even if the keyboard is shot.
[00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:19.920]   The screen is probably okay because it was just a spill.
[00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:20.920]   Who knows?
[00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:22.560]   Maybe I can find a good deal on unfortunate.
[00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:26.160]   The keyboard and trackpad is like hard glued into this.
[00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:27.800]   That's part of the case.
[00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:29.720]   So I'd have to replace the entire thing to make it happen.
[00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:34.080]   But if I can just have this thing that I can have in the office that I can connect to via
[00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:40.400]   Bluetooth or use as a use as a VPN server or something like that.
[00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:46.320]   Also as an ongoing reminder that don't try to get enough sleep.
[00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:50.040]   Don't just get enough sleep so that you don't do that on that.
[00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:51.040]   Fall unconscious promise.
[00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:55.120]   You can't take that is an issue I think with those sealed MacBooks because you can't take
[00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:58.520]   the battery out so you can't remove power.
[00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:02.080]   And the real problem of course is is not the sticky goo.
[00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:05.560]   You can clean that up is the is the shorts that it might cause.
[00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:08.840]   And if you short anything, you know, if there's still power applied to it and the liquid short
[00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:11.840]   circuits and fries circuits, you're gone.
[00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:13.760]   Because as you say, there's surface mountains.
[00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:14.760]   You're not going to replace it.
[00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:19.200]   And when I got power back to it and I you hear the bong.
[00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:20.200]   Yeah.
[00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:21.680]   Three, four.
[00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:23.120]   That means that hard.
[00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:24.800]   Max don't have post.
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:27.080]   It's not even seeing the SSD.
[00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:31.160]   The Max can't like be five times and let you know that's what's wrong.
[00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:36.280]   There's not there's no it's it's much like the the murdered the murdered victim at the
[00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:39.960]   start of a Colombo won't tell Colombo to feel good and how to bring it back to life.
[00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:40.960]   It's dead.
[00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:42.920]   It is an ex MacBook.
[00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:48.440]   But if if nothing else by it because because the SSD is a module that's removable and
[00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:54.000]   it's actually physically on the bottom plate of the assembly, maybe I will be able to
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.040]   not like that wipe it off.
[00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:58.840]   And again, there's there's no I don't think there's going to be any data on it that I
[00:41:58.840 --> 00:41:59.840]   that it hasn't already.
[00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:03.320]   But you know, other world computing makes external cases for it.
[00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:04.800]   So you can actually have that 256 gig.
[00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:06.200]   I guess we'll have it.
[00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:10.200]   And once again, a reminder of Andy lost time.
[00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:12.560]   Don't now don't know don't not drink.
[00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:13.760]   I doctor pepper.
[00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:14.760]   Okay.
[00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:20.240]   I wish you had taken the chance and said, Nope, I'm going to replace it with a iPad pro.
[00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:24.840]   That would have been an you know what I can't will I be able to take the iPad pro and replace
[00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:29.720]   the MacBook I use for this show with it somehow so because what we need is to be able to put
[00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:30.720]   up screens.
[00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:33.920]   I would say my out adapter.
[00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:34.920]   There is.
[00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:38.080]   In a few of my out and that's all we need.
[00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:43.480]   I would say I would say that if the only things that the iPad again, I'm speculating based
[00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:46.240]   on not a whole lot of experience hands on with the iPad pro.
[00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:50.840]   I mean, trivial compared to what Renee and Jim have had.
[00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:53.360]   But I would suspect that would be the same would be true.
[00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:54.360]   That's same.
[00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:59.720]   That's true of like the iPad air to where if you if your job involves peripherals, forget
[00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:00.720]   it.
[00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:06.160]   If your job requires you to routinely get files on the device and off the device, it's not
[00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:08.600]   impossible, but it's going to be a big pain in the butt.
[00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:12.960]   And if you spend most of your time doing this and using pointers, it's going to be kind
[00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:18.520]   of a pain in the butt to use it as a as a one to one replacement for your notebook as
[00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:22.800]   something that you use only when you're traveling or only when you're spending three or four
[00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:25.840]   hours outside of the office or outside of the house.
[00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:26.840]   Very possible.
[00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:31.440]   I would I think, you know, Jason, we should try to squaw get the HDMI out.
[00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:34.240]   Although we have we can airplay I could airplay to an Apple TV.
[00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:38.160]   We have an Apple TV hooked up to the TriCaster so I could do that.
[00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:39.320]   It's the old Apple TV.
[00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:41.760]   That doesn't matter, right?
[00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:46.520]   Is there is there a latency when you do it that way?
[00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:47.520]   It's been very good.
[00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:49.920]   I mean, like you never know when it's when a radio signal is involved, but it's always
[00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:50.920]   very good for me.
[00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:51.920]   Okay.
[00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:54.240]   Well, I'll get the connector in case, but but I think maybe we'll try that.
[00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:55.640]   That'd be kind of interesting.
[00:43:55.640 --> 00:44:01.600]   And I have to say having used the surface book, having touch for this particular use and maybe
[00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:04.280]   even the ability to use the pencil to illustrate.
[00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:05.760]   I can tell a straight.
[00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:06.600]   Now we're up all goes left.
[00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:07.600]   I can tell a straight.
[00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:10.520]   I can go wouldn't that be that might be cool.
[00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:14.960]   Yeah, I got a final cup pro or you know, huge professional suite.
[00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:15.960]   You're not going to be happy.
[00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:18.000]   I have computers at home and in the office.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:19.100]   I don't need to.
[00:44:19.100 --> 00:44:23.040]   But for for this show, I'm not using Xcode.
[00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:25.920]   It's very it's very correct for how people use computers today.
[00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:27.720]   We don't have just one computer.
[00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:30.720]   And for a while, we used to be we have a desktop and we have a notebook.
[00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:33.800]   And now we have a phone and we have a tablet and we have a notebook.
[00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:36.600]   We might even still have a desktop computer somewhere in the house.
[00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:41.840]   So this iPad pro doesn't have to be doesn't have to doesn't have to do everything that
[00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:43.000]   every notebook does.
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   It only has to do everything that you do with a notebook.
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:49.680]   And like Tim Cook said that interview, there are a lot of people for whom this is going
[00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:54.320]   to be a perfectly fine replacement, whether it's a good value for them.
[00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:55.720]   Well values another matter.
[00:44:55.720 --> 00:44:56.720]   Right.
[00:44:56.720 --> 00:44:59.920]   I mean, obviously the idea would be to have a purpose build device for everything.
[00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:01.600]   I just bought the new Kindle paper white.
[00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:05.560]   They just updated the paper white because I like to read on that instead of a tablet
[00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:10.000]   or a phone because it's the screens a little easier on my eyes.
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:11.400]   But frankly, I don't need it.
[00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:14.320]   I could use a tablet or a phone to read.
[00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:21.760]   But if you can afford it and it's only like 80 bucks only, but if you can afford it, that's
[00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:23.640]   it's a it may be a preference for some people.
[00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:25.040]   It may be a preferable.
[00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:26.040]   It's lighter.
[00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:27.880]   It's backlit, but it's not too bright.
[00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:28.880]   There's lots of reasons.
[00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:31.560]   I'm strapping my pad pro to my arm like Captain America.
[00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:32.560]   You don't need anything.
[00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:35.120]   I mean, you don't need anything before you want to go.
[00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:36.120]   Yeah.
[00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:37.120]   Yeah.
[00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:39.120]   I'll say one is easy to change, but it looks good.
[00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:40.120]   Yeah.
[00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:42.200]   This was my first trip with the Nexus phones.
[00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:46.080]   And it really did make me wish that if there's one thing that I wish that the iPad Pro had
[00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:47.080]   if USB C.
[00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:50.800]   Oh, I love type C because then everything can be type C, right?
[00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:55.240]   Well, not only everything can be type C, but you can do things like decide that actually
[00:45:55.240 --> 00:46:00.680]   I'm in a situation where I really would like this iPad to be a charger for another device
[00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:06.960]   or I would like this to be a standard standard data collector or standard source of photos.
[00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:10.920]   It was it's pretty it's pretty cool once you see what USB C can do.
[00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:13.360]   And given that we're all going to be stuck with USB C.
[00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:17.720]   Yeah, it's as long as so long as one device in your travel arsenal is USB C, you're going
[00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:19.520]   to be traveling with the right cables and colors.
[00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:23.080]   I got to think the iPhone 7 will have USB type C, right?
[00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:24.080]   I know.
[00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:25.080]   I know with Apple.
[00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:26.080]   You never know.
[00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:28.680]   But boy, I just so angry when they change from doc to lightning.
[00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:33.560]   So I know that was 10 years, but they've signaled this with the MacBook because the MacBook
[00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:34.560]   is type C.
[00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:38.320]   Yeah, but they don't they're not consistent like they put USB C on the Apple TV, but they
[00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:39.320]   put lightning on their own.
[00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:41.600]   I mean, it's that was weird on purpose.
[00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:45.920]   That was not no that USB on the Apple TV really threw me at first.
[00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:50.160]   I mean, for a long time, I thought it was lightning because just as a USB logo, I should
[00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:53.760]   have told me because lightning is not USB, but but I just I wasn't thinking it's roughly
[00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:56.360]   the same shape and it's, you know, symmetric.
[00:46:56.360 --> 00:47:01.640]   And I thought, oh, that must be lightning because they put a lightning cable in the box.
[00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:02.920]   They don't put a type C cable.
[00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:05.200]   You can't update the Apple TV with that though.
[00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:08.280]   You can't do anything much with the Apple TV except kind of reset it.
[00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:09.920]   You can you can screenshot with it.
[00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:11.840]   You can't video off the screen with it.
[00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:12.840]   You can use it.
[00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:13.840]   You can hook up to X code.
[00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:14.840]   You can look up to iTunes.
[00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:15.840]   You're kidding me.
[00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:16.840]   No, it's awesome.
[00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:20.880]   Oh, I didn't know you could screenshot record screenshot in X code, which is bit of a pain,
[00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:24.240]   but you can just you plug your Apple TV into your Mac, you start quick time, you choose
[00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:27.640]   Apple TV as a source and you can record anything that's not DRM.
[00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:29.920]   That's that's not just the developer edition.
[00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:30.920]   That's the no retail.
[00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:31.920]   Wow.
[00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:32.920]   I'm thinking on the retail one.
[00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:33.920]   Yeah.
[00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:37.320]   Of course, my Apple TV is in the hutch.
[00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:39.360]   My computer is in the hutch.
[00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:42.800]   He's in the hutch and my computer is on the desk.
[00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:43.800]   Leo has a gadget.
[00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:44.800]   Don't you have a hutch?
[00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:45.800]   Come on.
[00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:46.800]   Everybody has a hutch.
[00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:47.800]   The gadget hutch.
[00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:55.240]   All right, I'll tell you one other thing you could do with that Nexus 6P there, Andrew,
[00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:56.560]   you can now listen Apple music.
[00:47:56.560 --> 00:47:58.920]   We'll talk about that in just a little bit.
[00:47:58.920 --> 00:48:01.280]   Jim Dowryple is here from the loop.
[00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:02.840]   Nice to have you, Jim.
[00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:04.920]   Did you catch the Heineken truck?
[00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:05.920]   I did.
[00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:06.920]   Okay.
[00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:07.920]   Good.
[00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:09.440]   I have no issue with that.
[00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:14.200]   We were speculating that that's why you jumped up, leapt up and ran.
[00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:15.960]   We thought the Heineken truck was going by.
[00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:17.520]   Maybe you just wanted to get up.
[00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:19.720]   But for me, that's like the ice cream truck.
[00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:20.720]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:25.000]   They wring a little whistle and I just cake off down the street chasing them.
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:29.880]   Daddy, can I have $25 for the Heineken truck?
[00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:31.880]   Daddy.
[00:48:31.880 --> 00:48:37.520]   Renee Richie from i'm where.com and of course Andy Inaco from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:39.360]   Our show today brought to you by BrainTree.
[00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:42.640]   If you're a mobile app developer, you know that one of the, and you do commerce in your
[00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:45.680]   app or on your website, that this is the sticking point.
[00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:49.600]   I mean, this is the point for you because it's where you get the money.
[00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:50.600]   Show me the money.
[00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:54.480]   But it's also the point where very frequently your customers abandon you.
[00:48:54.480 --> 00:49:01.680]   In fact, the abandonment rate of mobile carts is 70%, 70%.
[00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:06.520]   What you really want is you want to make it easy for your customers to pay.
[00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:08.440]   You want to make it secure.
[00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:10.840]   You want to make them feel good.
[00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:13.640]   That's why Uber uses BrainTree in their app.
[00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:17.760]   That's why Lyft also uses BrainTree and Airbnb and hotels tonight.
[00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:21.040]   When you get competitors using the same product, you know you got the right one.
[00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:24.200]   With just a few lines of code, you're ready to accept payments.
[00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:27.040]   Not just payments, all kinds of payments.
[00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:31.280]   PayPal, of course, is a PayPal company, but also credit cards.
[00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:34.960]   Also Venmo, another PayPal product.
[00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:36.240]   Also Apple Pay.
[00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:40.720]   When Android Pay came out last month, it was just a checkbox in your control panel.
[00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:41.720]   Boom.
[00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:42.720]   You're taking Android Pay.
[00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:45.000]   It's additional coding on your part.
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:46.600]   It's just amazing.
[00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:52.400]   We recently spoke with Anker Aria, the General Manager of BrainTree Mobile, about this V.0
[00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:57.000]   SDK and how it makes changing payment options easy.
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:02.080]   We effectively feature-proof you against other wallets that become important or the other
[00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:04.720]   wallets that we go to the integration with.
[00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:09.240]   Once you've done the V.0 implementation, if we integrate a new wallet or we offer a new
[00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:14.400]   wallet, you can enable that via your control panel and it's just a simple app update to
[00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:15.400]   your app.
[00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:17.120]   Let's say if you're running it on an iOS app to enable that.
[00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:22.880]   So very, very transparent and seamless, very easy to get going and you're not sort of rewiring
[00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:24.680]   your app, which is super critical.
[00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:26.560]   Your customers love it.
[00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:27.560]   You will love it.
[00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:30.960]   Their fast payouts and continuous support mean it's easy for you.
[00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:35.800]   If you're telling the boss, "Hey boss, I found the payment system we're going to use."
[00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:37.920]   You want it to work well, right?
[00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:41.200]   Here's another tip you can tell the boss.
[00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:42.200]   Let's hear the boss.
[00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:43.680]   Tell yourself if you're the boss.
[00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:51.200]   BrainTree gives you the first $50,000 in transactions fee-free when you go to braintreepayments.com/macbreak.
[00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:57.120]   Without scale with you from your first dollar to your billionth, GitHub started with BrainTree
[00:50:57.120 --> 00:50:58.680]   and they're still using it.
[00:50:58.680 --> 00:51:00.680]   You've used it, therefore.
[00:51:00.680 --> 00:51:04.240]   braintreepayments.com/macbreak.
[00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:05.240]   Try it today.
[00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:06.240]   It is easy.
[00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:07.560]   You're going to love it.
[00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:11.520]   More importantly, your customers will too.
[00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:17.880]   The first Apple app ever for Android was this kind of trivial move to iOS.
[00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:20.680]   But now Apple's really done an Android app.
[00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:24.600]   Apple Music, that is weird, is on Android.
[00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:29.600]   It looks to me that even if you've already tried it for three months on your iPhone,
[00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:31.440]   you get to do it again on the Android.
[00:51:31.440 --> 00:51:34.320]   You get three months trial.
[00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:36.040]   It's very much like the iPhone.
[00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:37.040]   This is the onboarding.
[00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:38.600]   So you get the red dots.
[00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:39.600]   What are you into?
[00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:45.360]   I'd say rock, metal for Jim, classic rock for me.
[00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:47.360]   If you hit it a couple of times, it makes it bigger.
[00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:50.840]   You want to make it bigger.
[00:51:50.840 --> 00:51:53.400]   Classical music, I like that.
[00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:54.400]   R&B.
[00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:57.680]   Jim, you just kind of say it about Andy's story.
[00:51:57.680 --> 00:51:58.840]   I mean, I'm still sad.
[00:51:58.840 --> 00:52:01.280]   Oh, you're still sad.
[00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:02.280]   Yeah.
[00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:03.280]   Okay, I'm over.
[00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:06.800]   Well, it is sad when anybody loses a laptop.
[00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:07.800]   That's okay.
[00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:11.760]   That's more sympathy I've gotten from humanity in the past three months.
[00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:12.760]   I'll take it.
[00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:14.560]   I'm a sympathy camel, Jim.
[00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:15.560]   I can.
[00:52:15.560 --> 00:52:18.720]   I'm sticking that in my hump, but I'm going to live off that for the next time.
[00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:23.040]   Stick that up and smoke it.
[00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:24.040]   You know, I like country.
[00:52:24.040 --> 00:52:25.040]   I don't like it.
[00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:27.080]   Now, does this do anything by the way these blurs?
[00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:28.720]   It just making me feel good.
[00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:30.160]   It biases it towards those selectors.
[00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:33.320]   Do I have to fill up the U circle or can I just do a few things?
[00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:34.640]   Because I don't want to.
[00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:38.000]   It's encouraging me to do more and I don't want to do more.
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:42.520]   All right, I'm going to say classic rock and classical are my two big red dots.
[00:52:42.520 --> 00:52:44.040]   All right, choose your favor.
[00:52:44.040 --> 00:52:46.880]   Oh, now you have to choose artists.
[00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:48.440]   I'm not going to choose Van Halen.
[00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:51.120]   I don't even know who Nio is.
[00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:52.120]   Ricard Wagner.
[00:52:52.120 --> 00:52:54.160]   I like the London Symphony Orchestra.
[00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:55.720]   I love the kinks.
[00:52:55.720 --> 00:52:58.240]   Who doesn't love BB King?
[00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:01.560]   The Berlin Philharmonic AC/DC Jim, right?
[00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:02.760]   Oh, do it.
[00:53:02.760 --> 00:53:04.160]   I pressed the back button.
[00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:06.800]   OK, that's something Apple never thought about.
[00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:08.160]   A crap.
[00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:12.000]   I'm going to do it all over again.
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:14.840]   All right, I don't want to bore you all.
[00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:17.480]   The constructive navigation elements within the line of hand use.
[00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:18.840]   That is not, you know, there's--
[00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:19.840]   Mm-hmm.
[00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:20.840]   Uh-huh-uh-uh.
[00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:22.960]   That's a problem.
[00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:24.240]   That's kind of a problem.
[00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:26.760]   I guess they suspend the rules on Android apps.
[00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:29.640]   They're allowed to only paint the side of the fence that people do see.
[00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:32.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:33.280]   Deficient.
[00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:35.480]   Now I have a whole different set of things here.
[00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:36.280]   All right, let's see.
[00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:38.400]   How different is it from the Beats 1 app from Androix?
[00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:42.040]   I never really used that one.
[00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:43.400]   I don't remember, to be honest.
[00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:44.320]   I don't remember either.
[00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:47.320]   The Beats 1 was pretty similar on Android is to iOS.
[00:53:47.320 --> 00:53:50.840]   You know, you made the sentences and all that stuff.
[00:53:50.840 --> 00:53:53.240]   I think this is a duplicate.
[00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:54.840]   Did you-- have you set it all the way up?
[00:53:54.840 --> 00:53:55.280]   Anybody?
[00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:55.520]   Andy?
[00:53:55.520 --> 00:53:56.680]   Did you set it all the way up?
[00:53:56.680 --> 00:53:59.320]   Yeah, well, actually, it didn't even ask me.
[00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:01.080]   It just-- I just logged in with my--
[00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:02.720]   Oh, cuz you--
[00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:03.240]   Oh, yeah.
[00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:04.320]   You didn't have to go through this.
[00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:06.800]   Everything that I've got on my MacBook.
[00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:13.400]   So I like the fact that it's a straightforward, seamless process.
[00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:19.280]   They managed to have incorporated only those elements of Android 5
[00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:22.240]   and 6 that you really can't get around.
[00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:24.480]   It's a very, very familiar sort of interface.
[00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:29.120]   I mean, everything that I'd seen on my iPad just a couple days ago
[00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:30.160]   is right here in front of me.
[00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:32.040]   All the stuff that I just bought is right here in front of me.
[00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:32.520]   Yeah.
[00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:33.600]   So that's nice.
[00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:34.640]   Yeah.
[00:54:34.640 --> 00:54:39.960]   So I did not renew Apple Music on the iPhone.
[00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:41.520]   So I guess--
[00:54:41.520 --> 00:54:42.680]   It's your punishment.
[00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:47.400]   Yeah, I'm getting a new look, a new feel.
[00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:49.400]   I presume Beats without paying for it.
[00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:52.800]   You get three months, the same deal, $9.99.
[00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:53.240]   I presume--
[00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:54.280]   Always on breaking.
[00:54:54.280 --> 00:54:54.880]   Worldwide.
[00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:56.880]   Well, it's Julianna Nougat.
[00:54:56.880 --> 00:54:58.800]   Oh, we're back in the club.
[00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:00.240]   Let's rock and roll.
[00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:01.240]   I'm Julianna Nougat.
[00:55:01.240 --> 00:55:02.680]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:06.160]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:07.600]   Oh, you won't believe what--
[00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:08.560]   Oh, I like Saint Vincent.
[00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:09.920]   Oh, see, this is nice upcoming show.
[00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:11.000]   All right, I don't know.
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:13.920]   It's the same, right?
[00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:15.160]   Same stuff here.
[00:55:15.160 --> 00:55:16.280]   Oh, look at this.
[00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:18.200]   NPR, ESPN.
[00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:20.120]   So there's some talk in there.
[00:55:20.120 --> 00:55:21.280]   You can make some talk into my music.
[00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:22.120]   Is connect there, Leo?
[00:55:22.120 --> 00:55:23.520]   Can you get your social on?
[00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:25.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:55:25.160 --> 00:55:26.920]   Yeah, you better fade it.
[00:55:26.920 --> 00:55:29.400]   I got to say, it does feel like a very well-written Android
[00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:30.400]   app.
[00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:31.400]   It doesn't feel like--
[00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:34.600]   We've all on both sides, the fans used apps that felt like,
[00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:38.520]   OK, they outsourced the under--
[00:55:38.520 --> 00:55:41.440]   with no budget, the porting of a certain app.
[00:55:41.440 --> 00:55:42.840]   And it sort of works.
[00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:46.080]   If this were the first time we saw Apple Music,
[00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:48.080]   our brand new music service, I think
[00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:49.920]   that they were well-funded and well-intended.
[00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:51.920]   They did a great job.
[00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:54.320]   And they didn't-- nor did they try
[00:55:54.320 --> 00:55:57.200]   to port over the iOS interface.
[00:55:57.200 --> 00:55:58.600]   It really does feel like--
[00:55:58.600 --> 00:55:59.600]   It's native.
[00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:02.280]   If you chose Android or if you've been an Android user for a while,
[00:56:02.280 --> 00:56:04.440]   this is a completely familiar user interface.
[00:56:04.440 --> 00:56:05.880]   Absolutely native, yeah.
[00:56:05.880 --> 00:56:06.840]   Feels great.
[00:56:06.840 --> 00:56:09.120]   It's the same 100 countries except for China and China's
[00:56:09.120 --> 00:56:10.360]   coming soon.
[00:56:10.360 --> 00:56:12.200]   China's a big Android country, right?
[00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:13.600]   I mean, they have a lot of--
[00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:15.720]   70% or something.
[00:56:15.720 --> 00:56:16.600]   So they don't want to do that.
[00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:17.280]   Well, there you go.
[00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:21.840]   Apple shows that it can go cross-platform just fine.
[00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:24.200]   And it'll be interesting to see.
[00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:27.040]   I mean, now that's a huge set of people
[00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:30.200]   they're adding to the mix.
[00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:32.800]   They said 11 million paid subscribers,
[00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:35.560]   but that was just with iOS and Mac.
[00:56:35.560 --> 00:56:38.280]   So now that's on Android, we'll see if that goes up.
[00:56:38.280 --> 00:56:40.120]   Should at least double, I would think.
[00:56:40.120 --> 00:56:40.920]   Yeah.
[00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:43.120]   I can't imagine how much they're budgeting for tech support,
[00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:46.600]   though, because they know that's going to be a real big problem
[00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:49.160]   with the range of hardware that they're dealing with
[00:56:49.160 --> 00:56:54.160]   and having to coexist with other apps on the device
[00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:56.720]   that don't play as nicely because it's a less controlled
[00:56:56.720 --> 00:56:58.160]   environment than iOS.
[00:56:58.160 --> 00:57:00.560]   They gave it to the iTunes on Windows T-Man B.
[00:57:00.560 --> 00:57:01.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:57:01.760 --> 00:57:02.760]   They got nothing to do.
[00:57:02.760 --> 00:57:03.200]   Good to do.
[00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:04.200]   Sure.
[00:57:04.200 --> 00:57:05.680]   You guys are too busy, are you?
[00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:06.680]   And they're used to it.
[00:57:06.680 --> 00:57:07.680]   And they're used to it.
[00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:08.520]   Is it Adele?
[00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:10.080]   Oh, what are all--
[00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:11.800]   I don't know.
[00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:13.400]   We don't punish you by firing you.
[00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:16.120]   We punish you in other ways.
[00:57:16.120 --> 00:57:17.040]   It's Siberia.
[00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:19.040]   Siberia.
[00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:24.160]   Tell me, Doug, how much do you value your Apple-funded health
[00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:24.920]   insurance?
[00:57:24.920 --> 00:57:27.840]   Because we can arrange so you can keep it.
[00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:32.760]   But you might prefer to pay for your own insulin from now on.
[00:57:32.760 --> 00:57:36.760]   Samsung, Dask, how can I help you?
[00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:38.800]   I'm looking at the Tim Cook interview with the Telegraph
[00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:40.080]   just to see--
[00:57:40.080 --> 00:57:42.160]   you talked about more than just saying you don't need PCs
[00:57:42.160 --> 00:57:43.800]   anymore.
[00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:45.200]   He talked a little bit about the iPad,
[00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:46.880]   and he cannibalizing the iPhone.
[00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:50.080]   He says, that's fine, as long as we cannibalize ourselves.
[00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:51.400]   And I think that's fair enough.
[00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:53.080]   In fact, that's one of the things Apple's done really,
[00:57:53.080 --> 00:57:54.760]   as OK, historically, done very well,
[00:57:54.760 --> 00:57:58.080]   is not worried too much about cannibalizing the iPod
[00:57:58.080 --> 00:57:59.400]   with the iPhone.
[00:57:59.400 --> 00:58:01.800]   That's when we talk about the health device?
[00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:02.840]   Yeah.
[00:58:02.840 --> 00:58:04.760]   He says-- he's talking about the Apple Watch.
[00:58:04.760 --> 00:58:06.480]   I think we'll set new sales records as quarter.
[00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:08.520]   Things are going well.
[00:58:08.520 --> 00:58:11.320]   The Telegraph says he's keen to highlight its health benefits.
[00:58:11.320 --> 00:58:13.600]   It contains sensors, which allows people to monitor activity
[00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:15.520]   levels and heart rates and recounts
[00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:17.840]   how it saved a schoolboy, quote, oh, yeah,
[00:58:17.840 --> 00:58:21.280]   this is the football player who learned from his watch
[00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:22.520]   that his heart rate was elevated.
[00:58:22.520 --> 00:58:25.240]   He mentioned it to his trainer, sent him to the doctor.
[00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:27.880]   The doctor told him he would have died the following day.
[00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:31.360]   Had he not come in, basically his organs were shutting down.
[00:58:31.360 --> 00:58:35.960]   And thanks to Apple Watch, he lives to play another day.
[00:58:35.960 --> 00:58:37.840]   And that's pretty incredible when you think about it.
[00:58:37.840 --> 00:58:38.840]   Yeah.
[00:58:38.840 --> 00:58:41.520]   You know, things that--
[00:58:41.520 --> 00:58:43.360]   that would have been a tragic story
[00:58:43.360 --> 00:58:46.560]   that we would have heard on the news where this football player
[00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:49.520]   wasn't feeling well of practice, and the next day he died.
[00:58:49.520 --> 00:58:50.440]   Yep.
[00:58:50.440 --> 00:58:50.880]   You know?
[00:58:50.880 --> 00:58:56.000]   And one life, is it worth it?
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:56.520]   Yeah.
[00:58:56.520 --> 00:58:58.960]   I mean, it's pretty incredible.
[00:58:58.960 --> 00:59:01.280]   He does say that we don't want to put the watch
[00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:02.920]   through the FDA process.
[00:59:02.920 --> 00:59:05.560]   I wouldn't mind putting something adjacent to the watch
[00:59:05.560 --> 00:59:07.680]   through it, but not the watch.
[00:59:07.680 --> 00:59:10.360]   So this is getting FDA approval as a health device,
[00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:13.680]   a government regulated government licensed health product.
[00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:15.760]   He said it would hold us back from innovating too much
[00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:17.840]   because the cycles are too long.
[00:59:17.840 --> 00:59:18.520]   Yeah.
[00:59:18.520 --> 00:59:19.720]   And that makes sense, actually.
[00:59:19.720 --> 00:59:22.160]   But you can begin to envision other things that
[00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:26.480]   might be adjacent to it, maybe an app, maybe something else.
[00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:26.960]   So that's--
[00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:28.120]   Have a health band.
[00:59:28.120 --> 00:59:28.760]   Yeah.
[00:59:28.760 --> 00:59:29.920]   Yeah, that's interesting.
[00:59:29.920 --> 00:59:30.920]   Yeah.
[00:59:30.920 --> 00:59:31.400]   Yeah, that's good.
[00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:33.400]   When you take a look at these dermal sensors that
[00:59:33.400 --> 00:59:35.880]   can actually get blood readings, the first
[00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:39.240]   come to make a really good watch that can monitor blood
[00:59:39.240 --> 00:59:42.120]   sugar levels just interactively throughout the day,
[00:59:42.120 --> 00:59:45.000]   that's going to be a transformative element, not only
[00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:47.840]   in the management of diabetes, but probably also
[00:59:47.840 --> 00:59:51.480]   in the investigation of a better treatment or even a cure.
[00:59:51.480 --> 00:59:53.800]   When you get that data hour by hour,
[00:59:53.800 --> 00:59:56.760]   minute by minute, from millions of people.
[00:59:56.760 --> 00:59:59.480]   Do you think we saw one analyst estimate
[00:59:59.480 --> 01:00:01.160]   that Apple sold--
[01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:02.080]   what was it?
[01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:02.800]   7 million.
[01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:04.040]   7 million Apple watches.
[01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:06.960]   Do you think that's reasonably accurate?
[01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:08.000]   It's fit that levels.
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:08.640]   It's pretty good.
[01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:09.140]   Yeah.
[01:00:09.140 --> 01:00:11.480]   That's not what you'd expect.
[01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:16.120]   As for the Apple TV, Tim Cook says, "Early sales are good."
[01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:19.000]   "We got out of the shoot extremely strong, very strong
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:19.640]   in the first days."
[01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:22.040]   Somebody at the telegram doesn't actually--
[01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:24.440]   telegraph doesn't actually know what out of the shoot
[01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:24.680]   means.
[01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:30.720]   Obviously, not a rodeo fan because they spelled shoot SHOT.
[01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:33.240]   What is a rodeo, actually?
[01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:33.920]   I believe it's CHE.
[01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:37.320]   I think a daily circus.
[01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:39.500]   The key gauge of the success for--
[01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:41.620]   how did that get through the editorial process?
[01:00:41.620 --> 01:00:42.300]   It's interesting.
[01:00:42.300 --> 01:00:43.540]   We got out of the shoot.
[01:00:43.540 --> 01:00:46.260]   Like somebody's shooting at them.
[01:00:46.260 --> 01:00:46.780]   Very strong.
[01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:49.060]   Maybe they figured like it's Apple.
[01:00:49.060 --> 01:00:50.760]   They probably designed it just so it could photograph
[01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:54.140]   well as a static object and it could function and prepare.
[01:00:54.140 --> 01:00:56.380]   The gauge of success is the number of apps being developed.
[01:00:56.380 --> 01:00:58.300]   Cook says it's much larger than we would have predicted.
[01:00:58.300 --> 01:00:59.620]   I would agree with that.
[01:00:59.620 --> 01:01:00.620]   Response has been very good.
[01:01:00.620 --> 01:01:02.500]   The appster grows at leaps in the app.
[01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:03.500]   Isn't that the weird thing, though,
[01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:05.060]   like we're just talking about the iPad Pro,
[01:01:05.060 --> 01:01:06.740]   where they won't say exactly when it's going on.
[01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:08.240]   Which day or what hour the pre-orders are.
[01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:10.160]   They didn't do that with the Apple TV either.
[01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:11.960]   And it makes you think, well, maybe there's not enough.
[01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:14.240]   But then you go into the store and there's thousands of them
[01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:15.240]   on the shelves.
[01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:16.700]   So it makes it curious that they won't give you
[01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:19.960]   specific time or specific days.
[01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:21.480]   Asked whether Apple wants to launch
[01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:24.200]   its own content subscription streaming service, which, of course,
[01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:25.800]   has been rumored for years.
[01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:27.280]   Cook says, quote, we will see.
[01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:29.320]   The key question for us is can we do something better
[01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:30.960]   than acts as a catalyst?
[01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:32.960]   If we conclude that we can, then we would.
[01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:34.960]   But I wouldn't do something just to do something.
[01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:37.620]   Footnote here, Time Warner is now
[01:01:37.620 --> 01:01:42.180]   doing with Roku a deal so that if you don't want a Time Warner
[01:01:42.180 --> 01:01:46.060]   set-top box, you can use your Roku as a set-top box.
[01:01:46.060 --> 01:01:49.180]   So there are companies talking to other companies
[01:01:49.180 --> 01:01:50.300]   about this kind of thing.
[01:01:50.300 --> 01:01:52.140]   That was the Xbox original plan, right?
[01:01:52.140 --> 01:01:53.860]   Like you're supposed to be able to get an Xbox
[01:01:53.860 --> 01:01:55.620]   and use that in lieu of your cable device.
[01:01:55.620 --> 01:01:58.580]   Yeah, in fact, Microsoft shut down Windows Media Center,
[01:01:58.580 --> 01:02:00.620]   which I think a lot of people use.
[01:02:00.620 --> 01:02:02.740]   Certainly, I hear from awesome.
[01:02:02.740 --> 01:02:07.500]   Because it was the best way to do a DVR with their PC.
[01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:08.240]   But they shut it down.
[01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:09.640]   They stopped developing in 2009.
[01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:13.240]   They now actively deleted if you install Windows 10.
[01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:16.000]   And everybody assumed, well, that must mean the Xbox One
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.160]   is going to take that place.
[01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:18.800]   But they still, at least in the US,
[01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:22.720]   don't have a way to record from cable.
[01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:24.000]   I think there's an over-the-air device.
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.920]   It's HDMI pass through, but I think that's all you get.
[01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:28.240]   They've got to do that.
[01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:29.720]   Because I love the Xbox One.
[01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:31.160]   And I think it'd be a great media.
[01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:31.680]   I use it.
[01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:33.920]   I want you to do deals with cable companies
[01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:35.660]   to give you that instead of a cable box.
[01:02:35.660 --> 01:02:38.340]   And the cable industry is just so intelligent.
[01:02:38.340 --> 01:02:39.480]   That's the bottom line.
[01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:40.380]   This is really hard.
[01:02:40.380 --> 01:02:41.340]   I put a picture.
[01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:42.680]   I bought an Apple TV.
[01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:43.440]   I went to my mom's.
[01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:44.240]   I installed it for.
[01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:45.280]   I got it all set up.
[01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:47.320]   I took a picture of it next to her--
[01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:50.680]   and Viditron gives you these Samsung cable boxes.
[01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:54.120]   And the Samsung cable box, it looks like a 1930s VCR.
[01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:55.960]   It's complete with this cage and these huge--
[01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:57.400]   and it doesn't have a DVR.
[01:02:57.400 --> 01:02:59.560]   Anything in it, it is just a cable box.
[01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:01.280]   Just HDMI and HDMI out.
[01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:03.480]   And it's like three feet by two feet.
[01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:05.920]   And this is what we're dealing with in the cable industry.
[01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:10.000]   I've gone from Palm Trio to an iPhone 6S.
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.360]   And we still have almost exactly the same cable boxes.
[01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:14.480]   I'm loving the Apple TV.
[01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:16.000]   The more I use it, the more I like it.
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:17.000]   The pictures look great.
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:20.120]   I like being able to talk to Siri.
[01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:22.680]   Somebody's saying in the chat room that the ethernet--
[01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:23.280]   I'm sorry, Jim.
[01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:24.000]   Hold on a sec.
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.440]   That the ethernet cable is not as fast as Wi-Fi.
[01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:26.920]   Is that true?
[01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:27.400]   Because I do.
[01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:27.960]   It's true.
[01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:29.520]   It's 10-based T instead of Gigabit.
[01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:31.520]   And Wi-Fi is AC.
[01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:35.200]   I thought, here I am.
[01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:37.160]   I'm going to do the best possible thing.
[01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:38.200]   I'm plugged in the ethernet cable.
[01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:40.640]   So I'm taking it off because it does buffer.
[01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:43.880]   The other day, I was trying to watch Fargo, the TV show.
[01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:45.800]   And it says, it's going to be 14 minutes.
[01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:46.320]   Yeah.
[01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:48.240]   That's probably not your ethernet cable buffering.
[01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:50.080]   That's probably the connection going into your house
[01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:51.080]   and buffering it.
[01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:52.080]   Yeah.
[01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:56.000]   The 10-based T is probably fast enough for 1080p.
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.200]   I want to say a bad word about Comcast.
[01:03:58.200 --> 01:03:59.320]   But I won't.
[01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:00.480]   I have Comcast business.
[01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:01.880]   It's supposed to be 100 megabits.
[01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:03.840]   But anyway, I don't know.
[01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:05.120]   Wow.
[01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:06.840]   And it's buffering?
[01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:07.360]   Yeah.
[01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:08.920]   It shouldn't be buffering, should it?
[01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:09.720]   It should not.
[01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:11.080]   No.
[01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:12.640]   And this is something I bought on iTunes.
[01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:15.000]   So I'm getting it from Apple, which does a very good job
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:16.800]   with their CDN.
[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:17.840]   So I don't know.
[01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:18.360]   I'm baffled.
[01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:23.680]   Do you just watch HD videos of confetti cannons being shot?
[01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:26.480]   That'll affect the data rate, the compression.
[01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:27.760]   I plug in because I just don't--
[01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:29.760]   I don't have to deal with anything interfering with the radio
[01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:30.280]   signal.
[01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:32.440]   I've been fine.
[01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:33.520]   Actually, I'm sorry, Jim.
[01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:35.920]   You want to say something I was going to ask for.
[01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:36.400]   No?
[01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:36.920]   No?
[01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:37.920]   OK.
[01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:39.400]   Then the--
[01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:43.840]   has anybody been finding that the radios in the Apple TV
[01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:46.400]   are not as good as in the old one?
[01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:48.080]   Here's why I asked because I find my--
[01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:50.360]   I don't know whether it's in the apps or the radios
[01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:53.160]   that I'm getting a lot of drop connections
[01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:55.560]   and lots of video for--
[01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:57.080]   but it basically would look what seemed to be
[01:04:57.080 --> 01:05:02.040]   bandwidth problems on a couple apps like YouTube and HBO Go.
[01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:06.280]   And I swapped out the Apple TV box for a Roku 3
[01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:08.040]   and did not have any of those problems.
[01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:09.720]   And I don't know whether I've just--
[01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:11.920]   it's the placement of the radios or whether it's just
[01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:13.640]   the apps being wonky because now we
[01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:16.720]   have this new diagnostic variable that--
[01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:20.000]   are these apps being written correctly in these version 1.0s?
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.360]   I had the same thing.
[01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:22.280]   We went a bunch of tests.
[01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:24.120]   And for example, Netflix will start immediately,
[01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:25.200]   but iTunes will buffer.
[01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:26.000]   The radios are great.
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.720]   As far as I can tell, the radios are doing 802.11ac
[01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:29.880]   really, really well.
[01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:32.320]   Just some apps are not doing HTTP live streaming anywhere
[01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:33.560]   nearly as well as the other ones.
[01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:36.240]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:37.360]   Oh my god.
[01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:38.920]   Is that one of ours?
[01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:39.640]   Take your order up.
[01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:43.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:46.160]   Is there a case on a hurricane with a parachute coming?
[01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:47.520]   I'm going to--
[01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:49.520]   I have to go man my--
[01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:50.760]   any aircraft on here.
[01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:51.440]   So there's all of us.
[01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:53.960]   Oh my god, it's a Bud Light strafing.
[01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:59.640]   Chinese consumer demand for the iPhones
[01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:02.520]   remain strong according to Cook.
[01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:07.040]   As to India, it's early, early, early days--
[01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:09.040]   three earlys, if you're counting.
[01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:12.600]   But it is the next huge market for us, says Tim Cook.
[01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:13.760]   I thought that was--
[01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:14.480]   I don't know.
[01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:18.240]   I can't remember a previous time where they said anything.
[01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:20.280]   It's quite so explicit about India.
[01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:24.200]   They've been often talking about untapped markets
[01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:25.360]   left for the iPhone.
[01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:28.200]   But it's good to see that their attentions are--
[01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:30.120]   India is specifically on their map.
[01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:31.760]   Not that it wouldn't be.
[01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:35.040]   But it's good to see them finally mentioned
[01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:39.480]   that they're actually thinking about India.
[01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:44.360]   Well, after they start to really tap out China,
[01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:46.680]   but once they really have those money machines running
[01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:50.840]   in China, that's the next untapped market for iPhones.
[01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:54.360]   And it's the same sort of glorious luxury brand in India
[01:06:54.360 --> 01:06:55.680]   that it is anyplace else.
[01:06:55.680 --> 01:06:57.960]   It's just that the phone market is just radically different
[01:06:57.960 --> 01:06:59.120]   there.
[01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:01.280]   And of course, because Tim Cook was
[01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:03.440]   talking to the Telegraph, which is a British newspaper,
[01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:08.500]   they asked him about the investigatory powers
[01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:12.000]   bill that's currently in front of Parliament
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:17.240]   to force companies to provide unencrypted communications
[01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:19.200]   or back doors.
[01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:22.840]   The good news, by the way, I spoke to an economist senior editor
[01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:24.920]   yesterday, and I asked him specifically about that.
[01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:27.520]   And he said, it seems to have failed
[01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:30.160]   that they finally explained to the prime minister
[01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:32.480]   that if you have a backdoor and encryption,
[01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:35.000]   it kind of breaks it for everyone.
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:38.960]   Not to mention making Britain a data island as well
[01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:41.280]   as an actual island.
[01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:43.480]   But Cook did take a chance, this opportunity,
[01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:45.680]   to say to protect people who use any products you have
[01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:46.440]   to encrypt.
[01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:47.760]   You could just look around and see
[01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:49.280]   all the data breaches that are going on.
[01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:50.840]   These are things that are becoming more frequent.
[01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:52.960]   They can not only result in privacy breaches,
[01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:54.240]   but security issues.
[01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:57.760]   We believe very strongly in end to end encryption
[01:07:57.760 --> 01:07:59.960]   and no back doors.
[01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:02.000]   We don't think people want us to read their messages.
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.480]   We don't feel we have the right to read their emails.
[01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:08.240]   Any backdoor is a backdoor for everyone.
[01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:10.760]   Everybody wants to crack down on terrorists.
[01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:12.000]   Everybody wants to be secure.
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.680]   The question is how opening a backdoor
[01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:16.320]   can have very dire consequences.
[01:08:16.320 --> 01:08:16.760]   Absolutely.
[01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:17.320]   I agree.
[01:08:17.320 --> 01:08:18.160]   Yep.
[01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:20.440]   It's hard to disagree with what Tim's saying.
[01:08:20.440 --> 01:08:26.320]   I mean, and I understand what the government wants.
[01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:28.960]   The government wants Apple to open up a backdoor
[01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:30.320]   where only they can get to.
[01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:31.920]   That does not exist.
[01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:32.600]   Yeah.
[01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:35.560]   Once the door is there, if you have a brick wall
[01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:39.400]   and there's nothing, no way, no door in that brick wall,
[01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:40.520]   nobody can get through.
[01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:43.240]   As soon as you put a door in, somebody's going to break in.
[01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:43.920]   Yep.
[01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:48.120]   And that's, I mean, the government, the British government
[01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:51.400]   or any government that thinks that this is possible
[01:08:51.400 --> 01:08:53.920]   are the stupidest people in the face of the earth.
[01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:57.360]   And they really need to, those people obviously
[01:08:57.360 --> 01:08:59.040]   do not know technology at all.
[01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:04.760]   And they need to just back up because what they're suggesting
[01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:09.320]   that technology companies do is just going to be a disaster.
[01:09:09.320 --> 01:09:10.760]   That's what our guests said yesterday.
[01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:13.120]   He said, somebody explained a camera
[01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:14.760]   and that they could just go to Iceland
[01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:17.120]   and get encryption from them instead.
[01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:19.720]   You can't-- no country is an island, really.
[01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:22.120]   In fact, Cook says that we're all connected,
[01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:25.040]   whether we like it or not.
[01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:26.040]   He says it's not the case.
[01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:28.560]   Encryption is a rare thing that only two or three rich companies
[01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:30.320]   own, and you could regulate them in some ways.
[01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:34.160]   Encryption is widely available.
[01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:35.720]   It may make someone feel good for a moment,
[01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:37.000]   but it's not really of benefit.
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:38.520]   If you halt or weaken encryption,
[01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:40.680]   the people that you heard are not the folks that
[01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:41.680]   want to do bad things.
[01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:45.040]   It's the good people, the other people, know where to go.
[01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:46.560]   By the way, exactly the line I've
[01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:50.600]   said for decades about copy protection,
[01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:53.480]   it doesn't foil bad guys.
[01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:54.360]   They know how to break it.
[01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:59.000]   It only harms honest users.
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.520]   Data and identity theft has a very real human cost.
[01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:04.040]   He argues by jeopardizing people's financial security.
[01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:08.120]   It can affect their psychology and health.
[01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:10.320]   He's confident that the British government will do the right thing.
[01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:13.440]   And as I mentioned, it seems to be the case
[01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:17.760]   that they've realized this is a non-starter.
[01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:20.760]   So that's the entire interview with the telegraph.
[01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:25.360]   We talked about Apple TV.
[01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:27.200]   Any other thoughts about Apple TV?
[01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:27.920]   Thank you.
[01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:30.720]   Last week, you mentioned the Serenity Caldwell
[01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:32.400]   had an article about Apple TV, read that.
[01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:36.560]   And then she pointed to Apple's online manual for Apple TV,
[01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:40.200]   which does not come in the box, which is a must read.
[01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:41.960]   There's all sorts of little tricks
[01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:44.760]   you could do with that clicker.
[01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:48.080]   I was using it today, and I was entering search terms
[01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:49.560]   to test out the search app.
[01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:52.120]   And I couldn't find out how to blank out what I'd written
[01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:52.960]   to write something else.
[01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:53.800]   I probably wrote Batman.
[01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:55.440]   I wanted to change it to something else.
[01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:57.240]   And you just hold down the--
[01:10:57.240 --> 01:10:59.520]   you click and hold, and it pops up a bunch of things,
[01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:01.280]   like uppercase letters and variant letters.
[01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:03.040]   But it also has a backspace, for example.
[01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:04.760]   You can just swipe left as often as you want.
[01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:06.320]   It just starts deleting stuff for you,
[01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:08.320]   which is way faster than going all the way to the other end.
[01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:11.280]   It's all these sorts of things just baked into it
[01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:12.320]   that's impossible.
[01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:14.440]   I don't know if you saw it, but there was this article
[01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:17.720]   by Bruce Toggazini, and I forget the other man's name,
[01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:19.480]   today in Fast Company about how Apple
[01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:22.760]   has abandoned obviousness in their design.
[01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:25.760]   It made it much harder for everyone to use all these things.
[01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:27.240]   But at the same time, there's these--
[01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:28.880]   I got a tweet today from someone who said
[01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:30.360]   that you can now use Siri--
[01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:32.800]   sorry, not Siri, but dictation in airplane mode
[01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:33.560]   on your iPhone.
[01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:34.440]   It does it locally now.
[01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:34.880]   Nice.
[01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:36.400]   And I tried it, and it works.
[01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:38.280]   But these things are--
[01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:40.400]   they consider these things hidden as a downside.
[01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:42.600]   But at the same time, if you had to see all of them
[01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:44.040]   immediately all the time, I think
[01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:45.560]   it would be absolutely overwhelming.
[01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:47.040]   So I'm glad it's in manuals, and when
[01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:48.600]   you've gotten used to the basic stuff,
[01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:50.600]   and you're curious, you can go and find out more,
[01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:53.600]   but you're not overwhelmed by 9,000 different buttons
[01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:54.920]   all on the screen at the same time.
[01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:57.360]   Yeah, Togg is an Apple old-timer.
[01:11:57.360 --> 01:11:58.360]   Yes.
[01:11:58.360 --> 01:11:59.360]   I have an interface.
[01:11:59.360 --> 01:11:59.860]   Yeah.
[01:11:59.860 --> 01:12:02.240]   And by the way, he wrote this article with Don Norman,
[01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:04.680]   who was one of the kings of UI design.
[01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:10.080]   He's done all the research, wrote an amazing book about design.
[01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:12.080]   And I've kind of been saying this as well.
[01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:13.760]   But this is natural.
[01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:16.800]   This is kind of mission creep that over time,
[01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:19.280]   your operating system gets crafted up.
[01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:20.680]   There have become more ways to do this.
[01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:22.440]   Apple was so famous in the early days.
[01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:25.080]   And the thing I so celebrated with the first Mac
[01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:27.280]   was the Apple user interface guidelines, which
[01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:30.360]   were so clear and crisp and really made a difference.
[01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:32.880]   It did make it a computer for the rest of us.
[01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:34.520]   And they've drifted a little bit away from that.
[01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:36.520]   I have problems a lot in iOS with going.
[01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:37.760]   I don't know what to do here.
[01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:38.760]   I don't--
[01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:40.560]   No, it's not obvious.
[01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:42.960]   It's OK to have to learn some stuff.
[01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:45.720]   Not everything can be really upfront there
[01:12:45.720 --> 01:12:49.800]   with an obvious button or an obvious menu.
[01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:51.280]   My first couple of days with Apple TV
[01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:52.920]   did have a whole bunch of frustrations.
[01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:57.440]   But when I came back home after an entire week of not using it,
[01:12:57.440 --> 01:12:59.000]   and it was no longer an alien device
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:00.200]   was something I was coming back to,
[01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:02.840]   I found that I was really warming to a lot of its differences.
[01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:04.360]   I still think there are a bunch of ways
[01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:06.000]   that they could have made it a little bit simpler
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:07.240]   and a little bit friendlier.
[01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:09.120]   But I'm liking the--
[01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:11.840]   I'm really liking the touchpad a lot.
[01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:12.440]   I'm really liking--
[01:13:12.440 --> 01:13:13.480]   Oh, it's a little twitchy, though.
[01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:13.840]   Isn't it?
[01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:15.360]   Isn't it a little touchy?
[01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:17.480]   I think a lot of it is getting used to it,
[01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:19.600]   because I've never used a touchpad in that sort of--
[01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:22.840]   And learning never to put it somewhere where you can't
[01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:24.080]   accidentally touch it.
[01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:25.760]   Well, but once you--
[01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:28.520]   it's about reading that guide.
[01:13:28.520 --> 01:13:31.200]   Once you find out that, oh, if I touch it accidentally,
[01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:34.360]   I can say, I can say, I didn't mean that by tapping the menu
[01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:36.280]   button, and it will just simply forget
[01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:38.600]   that you've swiped it at all.
[01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:42.000]   There's going to be some learning required.
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.360]   It's just another incident where you really--
[01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:46.600]   it's hard to trust on a piece of new technology
[01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:49.240]   or review that drops after 48 hours,
[01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:52.280]   because sometimes you really do need to deprogram yourself
[01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:54.440]   from something you're familiar with before you can appreciate
[01:13:54.440 --> 01:13:55.920]   what makes this thing special.
[01:13:55.920 --> 01:13:57.240]   This article is not a review.
[01:13:57.240 --> 01:13:58.160]   It's much broader than that.
[01:13:58.160 --> 01:14:01.320]   Apple is destroying design, writes talk.
[01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:02.200]   It's hyperbolic.
[01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:03.880]   Worse, it's not at all hyperbolic.
[01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:06.360]   Worse is revitalizing the old belief, the design.
[01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:07.760]   And I'm not sure I disagree with it.
[01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:09.560]   I would say this is it right on.
[01:14:09.560 --> 01:14:11.480]   Design is only about making things look pretty.
[01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:12.240]   No, not so.
[01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:15.840]   Design is a way of thinking, of determining people's true
[01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:18.680]   underlying needs, and then delivering products and services
[01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:21.480]   that help the design combines an understanding of people,
[01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:23.680]   technology, society, and business.
[01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:25.480]   The production of beautiful objects
[01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:29.120]   is only one small component of modern design.
[01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:32.600]   Apple's reinforcing the old, discredited idea
[01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:35.240]   that the designer sold jobs to make things beautiful,
[01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:37.960]   even at the expense of providing the right functions,
[01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:41.480]   aiding understandability, and ensuring ease of use.
[01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:43.760]   They say, Apple, you used to be the leader.
[01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:45.920]   Why are you now so self-absorbed?
[01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:51.960]   And then worse, why does Google follow all your worst examples?
[01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:53.760]   I'm not sure I disagree with this.
[01:14:53.760 --> 01:14:56.400]   It's a bit of a manifesto.
[01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:57.400]   There's some good stuff in there.
[01:14:57.400 --> 01:15:00.920]   The problem is that they are not wrong,
[01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:05.720]   but they get to a good point, but they do it in a wrong manner.
[01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:07.440]   You can actually have differences of opinion
[01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:08.560]   about what makes good design.
[01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:09.920]   It's not that my opinion is right.
[01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:12.880]   Even as luminaries, though, they are,
[01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:14.880]   they have a very definitive point of view
[01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:15.760]   when it comes to design.
[01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:17.280]   And there are other alternate points of view,
[01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:19.200]   which is a good thing, because if everything looked the same,
[01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:21.080]   it'd be horribly boring.
[01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:22.440]   People at Apple really do believe
[01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:24.800]   that they are doing something that is aiding usability.
[01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:26.360]   You can say it's their bad choices,
[01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:28.440]   but they're not doing choices for the wrong reason.
[01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:31.120]   They're just choices that you don't happen to like and agree with.
[01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:32.920]   And I think if you understand that,
[01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:34.400]   it helps you explain it better.
[01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:37.240]   So this article, it reads almost like U-Madboro,
[01:15:37.240 --> 01:15:39.600]   sort of like in a cliched sort of sense.
[01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:43.160]   Instead of doing a deep dive into these are the choices they made.
[01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:44.520]   I understand why they made them,
[01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:46.160]   but these are potentially better choices,
[01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:48.240]   and here's the reason why.
[01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:50.720]   Well, the example they give, and actually,
[01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:52.920]   I love it that they put this back in Apple TV,
[01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:58.600]   but another problem is the inability to recover after an undesired action.
[01:15:58.600 --> 01:15:59.440]   One way to do it.
[01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:01.600]   It's an iOS 9, and they admit that later in the article.
[01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:03.760]   So I don't know why they've spent so much time on it in the article,
[01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:04.600]   because it's already a long enough.
[01:16:04.600 --> 01:16:09.120]   It took nine iterations of iOS to bring Undo back, basically.
[01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:11.880]   And I understand.
[01:16:11.880 --> 01:16:13.560]   Yeah.
[01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:16.440]   And by the way, that was one of the things people knocked Android for,
[01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:20.200]   was the back button, but that was essentially what the Undo was.
[01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:24.200]   Back button conflated in InterApp and IntraApp.
[01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:25.200]   I understand.
[01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:26.200]   Which for some people was confusing.
[01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:27.400]   Yeah, for some people it was confusing.
[01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:28.400]   Yeah.
[01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:30.600]   So again, like it's different set of opinions.
[01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:32.000]   Some people are like, "Great, give it to me right away.
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:33.000]   I'll figure it out."
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:34.000]   That's awesome.
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:35.000]   And other people are like, "I don't even know what this is doing.
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:36.000]   Take this away."
[01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:37.800]   And these are, again, they're not bad choices.
[01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:40.400]   You just might prefer one over the other.
[01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:44.320]   I think it's an article that is absolutely well worth reading.
[01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:46.720]   Did need to be written.
[01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:53.160]   And I somewhat agree with it, although, you know, I think this is an important conversation
[01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:54.160]   to have.
[01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:56.560]   I think Apple's sometimes given a free pass on UI.
[01:16:56.560 --> 01:16:59.200]   Like, well, because nobody else is even close.
[01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:03.280]   But doesn't mean Apple shouldn't continue to lead the way.
[01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:04.280]   Yeah.
[01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:09.680]   I think that we all need a good, broad perspective on how these things work.
[01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:15.360]   Oftentimes I'll read on a blog somebody who...
[01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:19.840]   I don't know how to put it.
[01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:24.760]   They don't recognize that the same thing that they're praising Apple for right now,
[01:17:24.760 --> 01:17:29.080]   the same user interface design, the same material, the physical design, that they're
[01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:33.960]   praising Apple for right now is something that they excoriated Android or Microsoft
[01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:36.680]   or someone else for two and a half or three years ago.
[01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:38.440]   So it's possible to have blinders on.
[01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:44.680]   It's possible to ignore the fact that every piece of design, good or bad is moved towards
[01:17:44.680 --> 01:17:48.280]   a certain purpose and trying to maximize specific variables.
[01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:56.360]   And sometimes it's just not a set of variables that are relevant to how you use this device.
[01:17:56.360 --> 01:17:58.280]   They say that Apple is misunderstood.
[01:17:58.280 --> 01:18:01.120]   Deeter Rams are always referring to Deeter Rams.
[01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:07.440]   The legendary designer at Brown, but they've completely misunderstood my writings.
[01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:11.720]   I had to have Deeter Rams right there.
[01:18:11.720 --> 01:18:13.720]   What do you have to say about it in reason?
[01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:16.720]   There's a great example in the article where they say it took Apple nine generations to
[01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:20.560]   get to showing lowercase versus uppercase keys on the keyboard.
[01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:21.560]   And that's very true.
[01:18:21.560 --> 01:18:25.160]   But at the same time, there's a lot of people, and you can see this in testing, who when
[01:18:25.160 --> 01:18:27.080]   something changes like that, they lose the glyph.
[01:18:27.080 --> 01:18:31.040]   So they see a lowercase, a changed from the uppercase, and they just lose track of it
[01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:32.760]   and they have to spend time reacquiring it.
[01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:35.680]   And that's the penalty that you pay for making it distinct.
[01:18:35.680 --> 01:18:38.940]   And all of these things have to be weighed and how many people this bother, how many
[01:18:38.940 --> 01:18:39.940]   people would help.
[01:18:39.940 --> 01:18:42.640]   And I think making it arbitrarily simple as a disservice to both.
[01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:46.160]   They could say, well, it's worth it, even though it has this cost.
[01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:48.000]   But to just say it's dumb, they didn't do it in nine years.
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:49.920]   I think, again, it's shortsighted.
[01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:50.920]   Drove me crazy.
[01:18:50.920 --> 01:18:55.240]   It was actually one of the primary reasons I left iOS to be honest with you.
[01:18:55.240 --> 01:18:58.960]   I was entering passwords wrong way too often because I had no idea.
[01:18:58.960 --> 01:19:00.600]   Are we uppercase or we lowercase?
[01:19:00.600 --> 01:19:02.720]   Although the shift key was looked was to blame for that.
[01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:05.560]   Look at Gruber, who says, I turned that feature off immediately.
[01:19:05.560 --> 01:19:07.280]   I like all uppercase.
[01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:08.280]   So there's always somebody.
[01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:10.800]   I wonder if you were there always uppercase?
[01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:14.240]   I love the way that they did the lowercase uppercase.
[01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:22.040]   I mean, it's probably a very simple thing, you know, that this is the way that they wanted
[01:19:22.040 --> 01:19:23.040]   to do it.
[01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:26.120]   But for me, I thought it was great.
[01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:27.120]   I really did.
[01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:28.120]   I use it all the time.
[01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:29.120]   Love it.
[01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:30.120]   Thought it was much needed, frankly.
[01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:31.120]   Yeah.
[01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:32.120]   Yeah.
[01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:37.800]   I saw that Gruber turned it off and, you know, I just, I didn't agree with his take.
[01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:39.920]   Doesn't drink Heineken, Jim.
[01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:42.640]   Well, I like it that you have the choice.
[01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:43.640]   I think that's great.
[01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:47.920]   You have to go deep into accessibility to turn it off, but that you can turn it off.
[01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:51.560]   Now of course, that means you've got lots more settings and proliferation of settings
[01:19:51.560 --> 01:19:53.760]   is another issue and you, I don't know.
[01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:54.960]   Everything is a compromise.
[01:19:54.960 --> 01:19:55.960]   Right.
[01:19:55.960 --> 01:19:56.960]   Right.
[01:19:56.960 --> 01:19:59.080]   Series better than Google now in Cortana.
[01:19:59.080 --> 01:20:00.080]   What?
[01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:07.080]   This is not the common communal wisdom, but apparently it might be the case, at least
[01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:12.640]   lately, a survey in which Siri, Google now and Cortana users were asked to rate their
[01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:15.000]   satisfaction.
[01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:16.760]   They actually had to do some work though.
[01:20:16.760 --> 01:20:22.040]   They had seven different requests and then they would report on how well each service
[01:20:22.040 --> 01:20:24.080]   performed.
[01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:28.120]   And you could see in the graph, Siri had the lowest percentage of incorrect answers,
[01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:35.000]   just fewer follow up questions before was able to carry out the task or answer the question.
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:39.520]   When does Kung Fu Panda 3 come out?
[01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:40.520]   Was the worst?
[01:20:40.520 --> 01:20:45.200]   It didn't do that well, apparently, but it did great when it was asked to set an appointment.
[01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:47.400]   Yes, Siri does that very well, right?
[01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:48.400]   Probably better than anybody else.
[01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:49.400]   I'd agree.
[01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:52.800]   Who won the Super Bowl in 1978?
[01:20:52.800 --> 01:20:55.960]   How many calories are in a muffin?
[01:20:55.960 --> 01:20:58.560]   I think that information comes from Google, let's be fair.
[01:20:58.560 --> 01:21:00.320]   Turn Wi-Fi setting on.
[01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:01.960]   That's a nice feature.
[01:21:01.960 --> 01:21:02.960]   Send a text message.
[01:21:02.960 --> 01:21:06.080]   Where can I buy tires?
[01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:07.880]   Experts exchange did this.
[01:21:07.880 --> 01:21:13.040]   So if you want to see the Battle of the Virtual Assistance, we should probably do something
[01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:13.880]   like this.
[01:21:13.880 --> 01:21:16.640]   Do you guys agree?
[01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:21.560]   I mean, I know this is an Apple show, but you guys are objective.
[01:21:21.560 --> 01:21:22.560]   Is Siri the best?
[01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:26.800]   It depends, so my problem with these things is that you have to define best upfront.
[01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:29.160]   This is customer satisfaction, so they're doing that.
[01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:31.680]   But for example, Google now does things that Siri doesn't do.
[01:21:31.680 --> 01:21:33.200]   So is that best for you?
[01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:34.960]   Siri is really good with multiple...
[01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:37.960]   Siri's traditionally gotten really good results with other languages that are better than...
[01:21:37.960 --> 01:21:41.200]   So if you use another language, maybe that's the most important thing to you.
[01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:44.760]   So these things often depend on what you hold dear and then you try to find the service
[01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:45.960]   that best sells needs.
[01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:47.360]   I think that's fair.
[01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:52.960]   But I guess what does the Virtual Assistant that you're using work for you?
[01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:53.960]   Siri works for me.
[01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:56.520]   I use Siri on my watch all the time.
[01:21:56.520 --> 01:21:59.520]   And it's more of...
[01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:03.600]   If I'm sitting down today, who's playing in the NHL tonight?
[01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:09.240]   Because being a Canadian, I take my teeth out, I get ready for the hockey game tonight.
[01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:11.920]   Come on, come on.
[01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:17.920]   Instead of going...I'll be on the computer instead of looking on the computer or my iPad or even
[01:22:17.920 --> 01:22:21.040]   picking up my phone, I'll just press and hold the button on the watch.
[01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:23.120]   What's the NHL schedule for tonight?
[01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:24.440]   And there it is.
[01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:28.120]   And I just scroll through and say, "Oh, great."
[01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:30.160]   I think you should do these...
[01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:32.160]   I mean, they put the commands online.
[01:22:32.160 --> 01:22:39.000]   I think you should probably do these yourself and see if you are equally satisfied with the
[01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:40.000]   results.
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.680]   Are you satisfied with your Virtual Assistant?
[01:22:42.680 --> 01:22:44.080]   I'm satisfied.
[01:22:44.080 --> 01:22:45.080]   Look it.
[01:22:45.080 --> 01:22:47.240]   Nobody's Scarlett Johansson in my phone.
[01:22:47.240 --> 01:22:49.280]   That's what I want.
[01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:52.160]   I want the cute little giggle.
[01:22:52.160 --> 01:22:57.240]   I wish that some of these things would clarify what satisfaction means.
[01:22:57.240 --> 01:22:58.240]   Because there are a lot of...
[01:22:58.240 --> 01:23:00.800]   I'll do a cute little for you.
[01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:02.960]   Sorry, Andy.
[01:23:02.960 --> 01:23:04.680]   Okay, Google.
[01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:07.080]   When does Kung Fu Panda 3 come out?
[01:23:07.080 --> 01:23:09.080]   I can't even get her to respond to me.
[01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:11.360]   She's just ignoring me right now.
[01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:12.960]   She's busy listening to Apple Music.
[01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:13.960]   Yeah.
[01:23:13.960 --> 01:23:14.960]   I'm sorry.
[01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:15.960]   Sorry, Dave.
[01:23:15.960 --> 01:23:17.960]   I can't do that.
[01:23:17.960 --> 01:23:19.720]   Oh, now she's not...
[01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:23.240]   I'm on the movie says Don Knots Been In.
[01:23:23.240 --> 01:23:25.240]   That's a good question.
[01:23:25.240 --> 01:23:28.680]   Oh, just did a Wikipedia search.
[01:23:28.680 --> 01:23:29.680]   Oh, yeah.
[01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:32.960]   Say I like it when they say Don Knots has been in 43 movies.
[01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:33.960]   I know.
[01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:34.960]   My favorite is...
[01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:35.960]   Give me the internet.
[01:23:35.960 --> 01:23:36.960]   There's not an answer.
[01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:37.960]   The incredible Mr. Whipple.
[01:23:37.960 --> 01:23:42.800]   I can go to the internet myself and type in.
[01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:45.080]   So give me an answer.
[01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:49.080]   If I'd wanted to do that, I would have just said search for Don Knots movies.
[01:23:49.080 --> 01:23:51.840]   Actually, you can do that on Apple TV.
[01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:54.960]   So you're saying Apple TV doesn't have to phone home to do those searches?
[01:23:54.960 --> 01:23:55.960]   Is that what you said?
[01:23:55.960 --> 01:23:56.960]   Oh, that was the iPhone 6s ask.
[01:23:56.960 --> 01:23:57.960]   You turn off the internet.
[01:23:57.960 --> 01:23:58.960]   It would still do dictation.
[01:23:58.960 --> 01:23:59.960]   Interesting.
[01:23:59.960 --> 01:24:00.960]   Oh, dictation.
[01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:01.960]   Okay.
[01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:02.960]   Yeah.
[01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:03.960]   Let's take a break.
[01:24:03.960 --> 01:24:04.960]   I want to show you my cables.
[01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:06.720]   Yeah, cables are big, you know.
[01:24:06.720 --> 01:24:08.920]   You got to have the good cables here.
[01:24:08.920 --> 01:24:13.360]   And Corning, you know the name Corning, the Gorilla Glass folks, they make fiber optic
[01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:19.840]   cables that have none of the problems and all of the benefits of fiber optic cables from
[01:24:19.840 --> 01:24:20.840]   the past.
[01:24:20.840 --> 01:24:24.760]   You probably know about the issues of fiber optic cables, right?
[01:24:24.760 --> 01:24:30.200]   When we put in our sand downstairs with the orange fiber, the engineers said, "Don't
[01:24:30.200 --> 01:24:31.760]   touch this.
[01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:32.760]   Don't step on it.
[01:24:32.760 --> 01:24:33.760]   Whatever you do."
[01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:34.760]   Here's a...
[01:24:34.760 --> 01:24:35.760]   This is fun.
[01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:38.360]   This is the new Corning optical cables.
[01:24:38.360 --> 01:24:40.800]   They're USB 3.optical and Thunderbolt.
[01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:44.240]   I'm using the Thunderbolt now on all my Thunderbolt devices.
[01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:48.880]   Because it's not only fast, you can go much longer distances because, you know what fiber
[01:24:48.880 --> 01:24:49.880]   optics is?
[01:24:49.880 --> 01:24:52.840]   It's using light instead of electricity.
[01:24:52.840 --> 01:24:55.240]   So these cables, there's actually kind of interesting.
[01:24:55.240 --> 01:25:02.960]   In the cables, they have put a little small, but a little extension on it.
[01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:05.200]   You can see it right here.
[01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:09.440]   It looks just like a normal Thunderbolt cable, but inside here is something that converts
[01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:13.520]   the electrical signal, because Thunderbolt expects copper, to light.
[01:25:13.520 --> 01:25:17.240]   And then there's a receiver on the other end that does the same thing.
[01:25:17.240 --> 01:25:19.360]   It converts the light to electrical signal.
[01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:20.960]   That is really kind of amazing.
[01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:23.520]   They can get it into something this small.
[01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:28.680]   And then they've gone a step further by making these cables very robust.
[01:25:28.680 --> 01:25:30.080]   So we have a little tester here.
[01:25:30.080 --> 01:25:31.600]   You're going to enjoy this, Jim.
[01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:34.760]   Corning gave me this little glass thing.
[01:25:34.760 --> 01:25:37.920]   And a laser pointer.
[01:25:37.920 --> 01:25:39.520]   So you can see the blinking red light.
[01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:43.200]   Now what I'm going to do is connect this modified cable to that.
[01:25:43.200 --> 01:25:46.280]   It's modified so I can actually just plug it into the laser.
[01:25:46.280 --> 01:25:50.320]   And as you can see, on the other end, the light comes out the other end.
[01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:51.320]   But thing is, watch.
[01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:52.760]   I can tie this into a knot.
[01:25:52.760 --> 01:25:55.600]   Now, don't try this with your other fiber optic cables.
[01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:58.120]   Only if you have corning fiber optic cables.
[01:25:58.120 --> 01:26:00.120]   Worse, it's still transmitting.
[01:26:00.120 --> 01:26:02.440]   Worse, I'm going to crimp these.
[01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:03.720]   And these are little holes.
[01:26:03.720 --> 01:26:11.560]   I'm going to crimp this like crazy and show you how incredible, resistant, robust these
[01:26:11.560 --> 01:26:12.560]   cables are.
[01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:17.120]   They're good enough now that you really should be using them instead of the copper, the old
[01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:19.480]   copper based cables.
[01:26:19.480 --> 01:26:22.800]   You can get exceptional throws on the 60 meters.
[01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:24.880]   That's 200 feet on Thunderbolt.
[01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:29.360]   That means you could put your storage area network or your Drobo in a closet down the
[01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:33.440]   hall and the basement 200 feet away.
[01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:36.320]   For a USB 3, 165 feet.
[01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:37.320]   Now, look at that.
[01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:39.800]   Have I crimped this and tied it in a knot?
[01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:40.800]   Let's see.
[01:26:40.800 --> 01:26:45.440]   It takes a bending and, yep, it keeps on sending my friends.
[01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:47.280]   These cables are robust.
[01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:48.280]   You can declutter.
[01:26:48.280 --> 01:26:49.440]   You can move peripherals out of the way.
[01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:53.360]   You can improve productivity, increase security by locking up expensive gear.
[01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:57.440]   They make safes now that you can put your USB drive in.
[01:26:57.440 --> 01:27:02.160]   If you're a video professional, if you need high speed of photographer, a great way to
[01:27:02.160 --> 01:27:08.560]   get amazing cabling, 50% thinner, 80% lighter than copper cables.
[01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:10.000]   Flexible, you can walk on them.
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:11.000]   You can bend them.
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.720]   You can tie them in a knot and they keep going at full speed.
[01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:16.600]   20 gigabits per second for Thunderbolt.
[01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:19.080]   Up to 5 gigabits per second for USB 3.
[01:27:19.080 --> 01:27:22.360]   No other cable even comes close.
[01:27:22.360 --> 01:27:30.600]   Go to opticalcablesbycorning.com to learn more optical cables by corning.com.
[01:27:30.600 --> 01:27:35.200]   To learn more, these are awesome.
[01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:37.320]   Just awesome cables.
[01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:42.680]   I like doing the magic act with them.
[01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:45.440]   By the way, I take full responsibility for that terrible slogan.
[01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:46.880]   It takes a bending and keeps on sending.
[01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:48.880]   I made that up my corning.
[01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:49.880]   Corning.
[01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:52.960]   In the end, that's known as a value add.
[01:27:52.960 --> 01:27:53.960]   That's value add, man.
[01:27:53.960 --> 01:27:55.280]   You don't have to pay me for that.
[01:27:55.280 --> 01:27:56.720]   I just give it to you.
[01:27:56.720 --> 01:27:58.560]   He's got a million of them.
[01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:03.840]   I went out and bought all these cables for my Drobo and for stuff.
[01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:05.520]   Because it's night, you know, I love it.
[01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:06.520]   My Mac's very quiet.
[01:28:06.520 --> 01:28:08.640]   It was the same thing with the Mac Pro.
[01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:12.320]   And then you put spinning drives on the desk and you can hear them now.
[01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:14.560]   They're really loud when you have a quiet computer.
[01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:15.760]   Now it's for the hutch.
[01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:16.760]   It's for the hutch.
[01:28:16.760 --> 01:28:19.640]   I put them in the hutch.
[01:28:19.640 --> 01:28:20.640]   Exactly.
[01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:21.640]   Exactly.
[01:28:21.640 --> 01:28:27.120]   It's corning to the hutch in the little part.
[01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:32.120]   I'm going to put away my cables.
[01:28:32.120 --> 01:28:39.160]   But while I'm doing that, have you seen this great article in Vintage Computing?
[01:28:39.160 --> 01:28:41.680]   This will take you down memory lane.
[01:28:41.680 --> 01:28:47.080]   These strange classic Mac peripherals ever.
[01:28:47.080 --> 01:28:50.160]   Vintage Computing is a really fun site for this kind of stuff.
[01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:55.840]   Oh, I knew back Charlie was going to be there.
[01:28:55.840 --> 01:29:00.080]   So if you want to run PC compatible software on your Mac classic, well that's what you
[01:29:00.080 --> 01:29:01.080]   need.
[01:29:01.080 --> 01:29:05.440]   Remember Charlie Chaplin was the pitchman for the original IBM PC.
[01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:11.120]   So here we are in 1984 running PC software on your Mac.
[01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:15.160]   And it looks, I mean talk about hanging a bag off the side.
[01:29:15.160 --> 01:29:17.160]   Holy cow.
[01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:18.720]   Things as big as the Mac.
[01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:24.840]   Oh, I bet there's still like a hole in the drywall somewhere in the campus that represents
[01:29:24.840 --> 01:29:26.760]   where Steve Jobs punched it.
[01:29:26.760 --> 01:29:28.800]   This is the opposite of design.
[01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:33.400]   How about this?
[01:29:33.400 --> 01:29:40.400]   A phone you glue to the side of your Mac classic and then plug in somehow, I guess, via the
[01:29:40.400 --> 01:29:41.960]   serial port to make phone calls.
[01:29:41.960 --> 01:29:45.240]   It's called the Mac phone for Macintosh lovers only.
[01:29:45.240 --> 01:29:49.440]   Don't you PC folks get excited about this.
[01:29:49.440 --> 01:29:54.400]   You got to really, really love your computer to put up with the most inconvenient way to
[01:29:54.400 --> 01:29:55.720]   call your mom ever.
[01:29:55.720 --> 01:29:59.280]   By the way, this is from 1984.
[01:29:59.280 --> 01:30:02.360]   This came out with the original Mac.
[01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:06.360]   The Ergotron Mac tilt a year later.
[01:30:06.360 --> 01:30:08.120]   Even the ads making me queasy.
[01:30:08.120 --> 01:30:09.920]   It's in Bloom County.
[01:30:09.920 --> 01:30:10.920]   Yeah, it does.
[01:30:10.920 --> 01:30:14.960]   It looks like the little dancing banana junior.
[01:30:14.960 --> 01:30:21.080]   The Microsoft, this came from Microsoft Mac enhancer.
[01:30:21.080 --> 01:30:22.520]   I don't remember this one.
[01:30:22.520 --> 01:30:28.880]   That was an okay device if you needed to hook it up to peripherals that were not made by
[01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:31.400]   Apple and don't necessarily cost a fortune.
[01:30:31.400 --> 01:30:36.240]   It added the one thing the Mac didn't have, a parallel port.
[01:30:36.240 --> 01:30:37.240]   Yeah.
[01:30:37.240 --> 01:30:41.760]   Okay, but if you already had like an eps and fx 80 that you already put down in your dollars
[01:30:41.760 --> 01:30:42.760]   for.
[01:30:42.760 --> 01:30:43.760]   Exactly.
[01:30:43.760 --> 01:30:44.760]   Exactly.
[01:30:44.760 --> 01:30:45.760]   How that wasn't in the Steve Jobs movie I'll never know.
[01:30:45.760 --> 01:30:48.800]   I'll be honest, I don't remember that.
[01:30:48.800 --> 01:30:50.720]   The computer condom from Hercules.
[01:30:50.720 --> 01:30:55.600]   I get the Mac enhancer all the time in my sandbox.
[01:30:55.600 --> 01:30:58.000]   If only it would connect to the iPod Pro.
[01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.560]   The Micro Rain Mac station from 1984.
[01:31:00.560 --> 01:31:06.160]   I guess you can mount an image writer on top of your Mac.
[01:31:06.160 --> 01:31:07.160]   Micro Rain.
[01:31:07.160 --> 01:31:08.160]   It's right.
[01:31:08.160 --> 01:31:09.160]   But obviously.
[01:31:09.160 --> 01:31:13.240]   Micro Rain fist you put a Mac on your Mac machine.
[01:31:13.240 --> 01:31:15.600]   This is why kids don't understand our generation.
[01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:22.720]   The idea so you would make people buy a separate printer for every computer in a lab.
[01:31:22.720 --> 01:31:24.520]   You had to bring a printer.
[01:31:24.520 --> 01:31:25.520]   Yeah.
[01:31:25.520 --> 01:31:26.520]   Those days.
[01:31:26.520 --> 01:31:32.800]   And by the way, on the sides floppy disk drives and they called it a Mac hutch.
[01:31:32.800 --> 01:31:37.000]   I'm not kidding.
[01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:38.800]   Micro Rain.
[01:31:38.800 --> 01:31:40.240]   Some straight dry weather.
[01:31:40.240 --> 01:31:42.640]   There's field of pain.
[01:31:42.640 --> 01:31:43.880]   Micro Rain.
[01:31:43.880 --> 01:31:46.320]   All right.
[01:31:46.320 --> 01:31:48.880]   Tell me you're getting one of those.
[01:31:48.880 --> 01:31:49.880]   For my hutch.
[01:31:49.880 --> 01:31:52.920]   You don't know when the pre-order starts.
[01:31:52.920 --> 01:31:58.600]   I think it would be fun to just measure out what the volume of that whole setup is.
[01:31:58.600 --> 01:32:03.240]   And figure out how many iPads and MacBooks can I stuff in that same volume.
[01:32:03.240 --> 01:32:04.240]   And wait.
[01:32:04.240 --> 01:32:08.560]   You've been able to buy money.
[01:32:08.560 --> 01:32:10.520]   I think you come up pretty good.
[01:32:10.520 --> 01:32:14.040]   You've got all of them in there.
[01:32:14.040 --> 01:32:15.520]   All right.
[01:32:15.520 --> 01:32:16.520]   Moving right along.
[01:32:16.520 --> 01:32:20.120]   That was our humor segment.
[01:32:20.120 --> 01:32:23.400]   Did you read the court's review of streaming TV players?
[01:32:23.400 --> 01:32:29.440]   I have to say he eliminated one of my favorites which is the NVIDIA Shield Android TV device.
[01:32:29.440 --> 01:32:30.920]   Saying it's not even up to snuff.
[01:32:30.920 --> 01:32:31.920]   I'm not even going to review it.
[01:32:31.920 --> 01:32:37.120]   But he did spend 10,000 words rating and reviewing the Apple TV versus the new Roku
[01:32:37.120 --> 01:32:46.520]   versus Amazon's Fire TV versus the Google Chromecast and says the winner is Apple TV.
[01:32:46.520 --> 01:32:50.480]   I don't think it's that simple.
[01:32:50.480 --> 01:32:54.360]   The winner is Apple TV if you use iTunes for sure.
[01:32:54.360 --> 01:32:57.200]   Just as if you use Amazon streaming the winner is Roku.
[01:32:57.200 --> 01:32:58.200]   Yeah.
[01:32:58.200 --> 01:32:59.920]   You live in the US or Fire TV.
[01:32:59.920 --> 01:33:00.920]   Yeah.
[01:33:00.920 --> 01:33:02.800]   If you live in the US it's different.
[01:33:02.800 --> 01:33:05.160]   He said if I had to recommend just one would be the new Apple TV.
[01:33:05.160 --> 01:33:08.200]   I think we're very happy with the Apple TV.
[01:33:08.200 --> 01:33:13.720]   He's really saying as others have said it's the potential that the Apple TV represents
[01:33:13.720 --> 01:33:16.520]   with the app store that's going to make it the most interesting.
[01:33:16.520 --> 01:33:17.520]   Right?
[01:33:17.520 --> 01:33:22.680]   Well, and that's what we have to remember right now with Apple TV is what we've seen
[01:33:22.680 --> 01:33:25.880]   is the foundation of what's to come.
[01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:26.880]   So yeah.
[01:33:26.880 --> 01:33:27.880]   Yeah.
[01:33:27.880 --> 01:33:34.240]   What we're going to see soon should be incredible.
[01:33:34.240 --> 01:33:35.920]   Renee, you counted when they came out.
[01:33:35.920 --> 01:33:36.920]   You counted all the apps.
[01:33:36.920 --> 01:33:37.920]   Have you counted it since?
[01:33:37.920 --> 01:33:40.560]   You know how many new apps are out?
[01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:42.200]   It's like 1300 as of today.
[01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:43.200]   Wow.
[01:33:43.200 --> 01:33:44.200]   Wow.
[01:33:44.200 --> 01:33:45.600]   Let's see if I can find the number.
[01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:46.600]   I know Jeff Scott.
[01:33:46.600 --> 01:33:47.600]   We don't.
[01:33:47.600 --> 01:33:48.600]   He does slide to play.
[01:33:48.600 --> 01:33:49.600]   He's been counting them every day.
[01:33:49.600 --> 01:33:50.600]   Just to see.
[01:33:50.600 --> 01:33:52.960]   Just to show you how in fluxes all is.
[01:33:52.960 --> 01:33:56.560]   We are finally now at the point where you cannot see every single app just by searching
[01:33:56.560 --> 01:34:00.480]   for the letter A then searching for the order B, which was the only way you could do it
[01:34:00.480 --> 01:34:01.920]   for the first few days.
[01:34:01.920 --> 01:34:06.840]   Is Apple going to add some sort of navigation feature that makes it easier to, I don't know,
[01:34:06.840 --> 01:34:09.040]   feels like there should be a better way to do that.
[01:34:09.040 --> 01:34:10.040]   Well, they have.
[01:34:10.040 --> 01:34:12.920]   I mean, they haven't done this in iOS yet, but ideally it would be the same sort of
[01:34:12.920 --> 01:34:16.280]   Siri functionality that you have for movies and TV shows where you could say, show me
[01:34:16.280 --> 01:34:19.960]   racing games, show me action games, show me platformers.
[01:34:19.960 --> 01:34:21.480]   And that they can add, right?
[01:34:21.480 --> 01:34:27.320]   But you know, with Siri and the way that Apple adds new features to its products, when
[01:34:27.320 --> 01:34:33.600]   it adds something brand new like Siri on Apple TV, it typically does it very slowly.
[01:34:33.600 --> 01:34:40.840]   So it'll add what it knows, iTunes, TV shows, movies, and that's it.
[01:34:40.840 --> 01:34:44.800]   You know, it's not going to add a whole bunch of channels and, you know, lay it out there
[01:34:44.800 --> 01:34:48.400]   when there could be a problem that will affect it across the board.
[01:34:48.400 --> 01:34:52.680]   Right now they're in control of everything and they can put it out there.
[01:34:52.680 --> 01:34:58.520]   But don't be surprised in the next event when Apple TV is mentioned that they say,
[01:34:58.520 --> 01:35:02.000]   "Oh yeah, we've added Siri for sports."
[01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:07.800]   So now you can search ESPN and search for college football games or whatever and it'll
[01:35:07.800 --> 01:35:09.040]   show up.
[01:35:09.040 --> 01:35:11.800]   And that's just the way that they do things.
[01:35:11.800 --> 01:35:16.200]   There's 1,404 apps as of today, according to the last Scott from Slide to Play.
[01:35:16.200 --> 01:35:17.200]   Nice.
[01:35:17.200 --> 01:35:18.200]   Yeah.
[01:35:18.200 --> 01:35:24.040]   So we'll say that it seems as though Apple's doing a lot more of these releases where there
[01:35:24.040 --> 01:35:28.160]   are obvious features where you know that these features are going to be coming in six months
[01:35:28.160 --> 01:35:30.360]   to a year from now that aren't there anymore.
[01:35:30.360 --> 01:35:34.480]   It seems like now you can sort of count on that sort of happening where it just feels
[01:35:34.480 --> 01:35:42.600]   as though there is an empty socket inside the product that is like an iron used for
[01:35:42.600 --> 01:35:44.280]   future to go later.
[01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:45.280]   Yeah.
[01:35:45.280 --> 01:35:46.280]   Well they didn't add that.
[01:35:46.280 --> 01:35:47.280]   They didn't add that to admit.
[01:35:47.280 --> 01:35:50.200]   No, there's no staring for Apple music right now.
[01:35:50.200 --> 01:35:51.200]   Yeah.
[01:35:51.200 --> 01:35:54.800]   It seems like an odd thing to omit at launch just like support for Bluetooth keyboards
[01:35:54.800 --> 01:35:57.680]   seems like an odd thing to omit at launch.
[01:35:57.680 --> 01:36:01.800]   I don't know that that actually means anything but it does.
[01:36:01.800 --> 01:36:05.640]   There was a time where I didn't sort of expect that and now I'm just sort of...
[01:36:05.640 --> 01:36:10.160]   I'm philosophical about it to be sure, think, "Well it's a growing platform.
[01:36:10.160 --> 01:36:13.680]   It's a 1.0 and I'm sure that will happen as part of a free update that you don't even
[01:36:13.680 --> 01:36:14.680]   have to go and get.
[01:36:14.680 --> 01:36:16.480]   It will just simply land in your doorstep."
[01:36:16.480 --> 01:36:21.120]   But it seems as though when I first flight with a lot of Apple hardware is I thought
[01:36:21.120 --> 01:36:22.120]   that that would work.
[01:36:22.120 --> 01:36:23.120]   I guess it doesn't.
[01:36:23.120 --> 01:36:24.120]   Okay.
[01:36:24.120 --> 01:36:25.120]   There's two things that are...
[01:36:25.120 --> 01:36:26.120]   They're super interesting to me.
[01:36:26.120 --> 01:36:28.440]   One is there's things that they obviously just didn't have time to finish.
[01:36:28.440 --> 01:36:32.360]   Like when you look at the demo from Apple's September event you can see the podcast app
[01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:35.800]   peeking out and if you go to the developer documents that you see they actually show
[01:36:35.800 --> 01:36:40.440]   you the podcast app icon and they just didn't have time to finish it and ship it obvious
[01:36:40.440 --> 01:36:41.600]   or they changed their minds.
[01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:43.800]   But more likely it's just not finished yet.
[01:36:43.800 --> 01:36:47.520]   Siri for Apple Music is another thing because Apple Music has Siri on the iPhone and it's
[01:36:47.520 --> 01:36:49.520]   a big service and why wouldn't have it.
[01:36:49.520 --> 01:36:52.680]   Then you'd have things like the keyboard where it's like, "Is this a philosophical argument?
[01:36:52.680 --> 01:36:56.320]   Are some people saying, 'Well if you want keyboards and web browsers that's really
[01:36:56.320 --> 01:36:58.720]   a get a Mac mini with an HDMI port.
[01:36:58.720 --> 01:37:02.200]   This we want this to be purpose built for entertainment and we don't want it to bog down
[01:37:02.200 --> 01:37:03.880]   with computer conventions."
[01:37:03.880 --> 01:37:07.600]   The former I think is just a matter of time where the latter is sort of different people
[01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:10.120]   have to win different arguments.
[01:37:10.120 --> 01:37:13.960]   I thought Siri for Apple Music was that but it's in 9/1 I guess.
[01:37:13.960 --> 01:37:15.960]   It's in beta.
[01:37:15.960 --> 01:37:21.000]   It launched with Apple Music on iOS but it hasn't, yeah I think it's in the beta but
[01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:24.400]   it wasn't there at launch which is, people think that Apple had two and a half years
[01:37:24.400 --> 01:37:29.120]   to build this box but really this box is coming out hot.
[01:37:29.120 --> 01:37:31.720]   9.01 is out.
[01:37:31.720 --> 01:37:34.400]   Do we know what it changes because Apple doesn't say much.
[01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:41.400]   It has the heck out of that performance, Leo.
[01:37:41.400 --> 01:37:43.440]   I don't know.
[01:37:43.440 --> 01:37:44.720]   It will update automatically, right?
[01:37:44.720 --> 01:37:45.880]   I haven't checked my Apple TV.
[01:37:45.880 --> 01:37:46.920]   You go to software updates.
[01:37:46.920 --> 01:37:47.920]   You have to do it.
[01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:50.680]   I think you can set it to automatic but I don't think it defaults to it.
[01:37:50.680 --> 01:37:51.680]   I haven't set to automatic.
[01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:52.680]   I didn't check.
[01:37:52.680 --> 01:37:57.600]   By the way, here's the ad blocker announcement I get from going to Cultimac with UBlock
[01:37:57.600 --> 01:37:58.600]   Origin.
[01:37:58.600 --> 01:37:59.600]   Adblockers, boo!
[01:37:59.600 --> 01:38:02.200]   When you visit Cultimac while running an ad blocker you heard our business.
[01:38:02.200 --> 01:38:07.320]   You're going to do this Jim on loopinsight.com as a small business which provides a dozen
[01:38:07.320 --> 01:38:08.320]   people's livelihoods.
[01:38:08.320 --> 01:38:09.880]   We need to serve ads to survive.
[01:38:09.880 --> 01:38:14.040]   We work hard to keep ads as relevant and as high quality as the editorial doesn't always
[01:38:14.040 --> 01:38:15.040]   happen.
[01:38:15.040 --> 01:38:16.040]   We're trying!
[01:38:16.040 --> 01:38:19.320]   If you want to read the site, please, whitelist Cultimac.
[01:38:19.320 --> 01:38:22.280]   All right, all right, all right, let me do that right now.
[01:38:22.280 --> 01:38:24.200]   I'm not going to make fun of that.
[01:38:24.200 --> 01:38:25.200]   No, I sympathize.
[01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:28.560]   That's exactly the response that I hope that these sites do.
[01:38:28.560 --> 01:38:29.560]   That's the way to do it.
[01:38:29.560 --> 01:38:34.000]   The XXplain, here is why it's important for you to whitelist us and here's how to whitelist
[01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:35.000]   us.
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.200]   We thank you for whitelisting us.
[01:38:37.200 --> 01:38:41.920]   When I read that for the first time, I couldn't help but think of the "don't copy that floppy
[01:38:41.920 --> 01:38:46.840]   poster of my high school computer" a lot of sites are doing a little more subtly.
[01:38:46.840 --> 01:38:50.120]   Like the cookies announcement with a little banner saying, "Hey, we see you using an ad
[01:38:50.120 --> 01:38:51.120]   blocker.
[01:38:51.120 --> 01:38:53.120]   We'd really appreciate if you'd whitelist us."
[01:38:53.120 --> 01:38:54.120]   I think that's...
[01:38:54.120 --> 01:38:55.120]   I get the idea.
[01:38:55.120 --> 01:38:57.360]   By the way, Cultimac, I'm just whitelisted you right now.
[01:38:57.360 --> 01:38:58.560]   There you go.
[01:38:58.560 --> 01:39:02.720]   My concern is that economist thing where the company that provides the anti-ad blocking
[01:39:02.720 --> 01:39:04.560]   ends up fustooning you with malware.
[01:39:04.560 --> 01:39:05.480]   It's a careful line.
[01:39:05.480 --> 01:39:06.560]   You have to lock it.
[01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:07.560]   It's a careful line.
[01:39:07.560 --> 01:39:08.560]   It's a careful line.
[01:39:08.560 --> 01:39:09.560]   It's a careful line.
[01:39:09.560 --> 01:39:10.560]   It's a careful line.
[01:39:10.560 --> 01:39:11.560]   It's a careful line.
[01:39:11.560 --> 01:39:12.560]   It's a careful line.
[01:39:12.560 --> 01:39:13.560]   It's a careful line.
[01:39:13.560 --> 01:39:14.560]   It's a careful line.
[01:39:14.560 --> 01:39:15.560]   It's a careful line.
[01:39:15.560 --> 01:39:16.560]   It's a careful line.
[01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:17.560]   It's a careful line.
[01:39:17.560 --> 01:39:18.560]   It's a careful line.
[01:39:18.560 --> 01:39:19.560]   Everything is an attack surface.
[01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:20.560]   It is.
[01:39:20.560 --> 01:39:21.560]   Oh my God.
[01:39:21.560 --> 01:39:22.560]   Now I can't read this site.
[01:39:22.560 --> 01:39:24.960]   Jim is sort of a band called attack surface because it's a good name.
[01:39:24.960 --> 01:39:26.280]   It's a good name.
[01:39:26.280 --> 01:39:28.120]   It's a good name.
[01:39:28.120 --> 01:39:35.880]   An insider tells Apple Insider that Apple will launch new metal 4-inch iPhone with an A9
[01:39:35.880 --> 01:39:38.680]   CPU next year.
[01:39:38.680 --> 01:39:42.000]   On the other hand, I've seen other rumors that says no smaller iPhone.
[01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:43.000]   What do we think?
[01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:44.000]   The AGI securities did.
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:45.840]   I mean, they've got...
[01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:47.440]   It's hard to predict these things.
[01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:48.440]   Obviously, you have one.
[01:39:48.440 --> 01:39:49.440]   This is Bingchee.
[01:39:49.440 --> 01:39:50.440]   Whoa.
[01:39:50.440 --> 01:39:51.440]   The famous.
[01:39:51.440 --> 01:39:52.760]   I think they have two sources on this now, but they had one last...
[01:39:52.760 --> 01:39:55.120]   I believe they had one last year and they chose not to really...
[01:39:55.120 --> 01:39:56.120]   Right.
[01:39:56.120 --> 01:39:58.080]   It's one of those things that they can choose at any time.
[01:39:58.080 --> 01:39:59.640]   The market is going to...
[01:39:59.640 --> 01:40:00.640]   They're really smart company.
[01:40:00.640 --> 01:40:01.640]   They do their market research.
[01:40:01.640 --> 01:40:05.040]   And if they believe that it'll move the needle for them to have a small one again, they will.
[01:40:05.040 --> 01:40:08.160]   If they think most people are still only buying big phones these days.
[01:40:08.160 --> 01:40:11.600]   Previously, not that many people in North America were buying big phones, so they were
[01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:12.600]   happy making small ones.
[01:40:12.600 --> 01:40:16.240]   Now, people are buying big phones, so they're not making small ones.
[01:40:16.240 --> 01:40:19.800]   If you're on either side of those trend lines, then you're not going to be happy because Apple
[01:40:19.800 --> 01:40:22.600]   doesn't make three dozen phones.
[01:40:22.600 --> 01:40:25.040]   Thanks to a developer Steve Troughton-Smith.
[01:40:25.040 --> 01:40:28.720]   We have found a hidden app.
[01:40:28.720 --> 01:40:35.000]   If you search the App Store for indoor survey, you won't find it.
[01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:45.400]   But if you click the direct link, you'll find this special app that allows you to do what?
[01:40:45.400 --> 01:40:46.400]   Holders?
[01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:47.400]   Oh, the indoor survey.
[01:40:47.400 --> 01:40:49.280]   That's been around for years.
[01:40:49.280 --> 01:40:51.280]   That's just what Apple gives to your partners.
[01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:52.280]   It's for mapping, right?
[01:40:52.280 --> 01:40:53.280]   Yeah.
[01:40:53.280 --> 01:40:57.320]   It measures RF data and combines it with iPhone sensor data.
[01:40:57.320 --> 01:41:01.920]   And now you can indoor positioning without installing special hardware.
[01:41:01.920 --> 01:41:05.360]   Is this to go along with Ibekins or...?
[01:41:05.360 --> 01:41:06.760]   It's all part of Apple's Geo team.
[01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:09.440]   It's just one of those things that they've been doing indoor mapping for a couple of years.
[01:41:09.440 --> 01:41:11.680]   And this is what they provide to their partners to do it with.
[01:41:11.680 --> 01:41:17.240]   How would you find a hidden app if it doesn't show up in the search index?
[01:41:17.240 --> 01:41:18.240]   Steve couldn't find anything.
[01:41:18.240 --> 01:41:21.720]   He found folders for the Apple TV.
[01:41:21.720 --> 01:41:25.240]   He found CarPlay and the original iOS betas.
[01:41:25.240 --> 01:41:26.240]   Snakey stinky.
[01:41:26.240 --> 01:41:27.240]   He's a smart guy.
[01:41:27.240 --> 01:41:28.240]   There you go.
[01:41:28.240 --> 01:41:30.880]   And a really nice guy too.
[01:41:30.880 --> 01:41:34.760]   And he also makes an amazing app called Grace, which is designed entirely to help autistic
[01:41:34.760 --> 01:41:35.760]   children communicate.
[01:41:35.760 --> 01:41:37.320]   Oh, that's neat.
[01:41:37.320 --> 01:41:39.600]   Is that his primary app or is it just a side project?
[01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:42.880]   He does one called Speed too as well that tells you the velocity of something with your
[01:41:42.880 --> 01:41:43.880]   iPhone.
[01:41:43.880 --> 01:41:44.880]   But...
[01:41:44.880 --> 01:41:45.880]   Grace and Speed.
[01:41:45.880 --> 01:41:46.880]   If you go...
[01:41:46.880 --> 01:41:49.520]   I think it's high caffeine content is his website.
[01:41:49.520 --> 01:41:50.520]   Okay.
[01:41:50.520 --> 01:41:51.520]   That's what we'll do.
[01:41:51.520 --> 01:41:52.520]   What a plug.
[01:41:52.520 --> 01:41:53.520]   Whoa.
[01:41:53.520 --> 01:41:56.800]   I don't know what just happened, but I feel like I'm traveling to the moon.
[01:41:56.800 --> 01:41:57.800]   Visualization.
[01:41:57.800 --> 01:42:00.800]   Oh, it's visualization of nothing, by the way.
[01:42:00.800 --> 01:42:02.560]   So it's nothing's playing.
[01:42:02.560 --> 01:42:06.240]   That's what nothing looks like when you listen to it.
[01:42:06.240 --> 01:42:10.240]   It's like a Roger Waters song.
[01:42:10.240 --> 01:42:12.520]   Gladys.
[01:42:12.520 --> 01:42:14.320]   GraceApp.com Leo.
[01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:16.040]   G-R-A-C-E-A-P-P.com.
[01:42:16.040 --> 01:42:24.280]   Give Steve a little plug for his Grace app for Autism on iPhone iPad.
[01:42:24.280 --> 01:42:29.000]   And iPod Touch, but this would be great on the iPad Plus Pro.
[01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:30.000]   I'm sorry.
[01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:31.000]   Pro.
[01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:32.000]   Very cool.
[01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:33.800]   Let's take a break.
[01:42:33.800 --> 01:42:35.960]   And I would like to get your pics.
[01:42:35.960 --> 01:42:36.960]   My friends.
[01:42:36.960 --> 01:42:39.960]   Jim, you're going to pick another heavy metal band.
[01:42:39.960 --> 01:42:41.960]   Oh, you know.
[01:42:41.960 --> 01:42:43.960]   I could have a little surprise.
[01:42:43.960 --> 01:42:45.960]   We'll give you some time.
[01:42:45.960 --> 01:42:46.960]   All right.
[01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:47.960]   All right.
[01:42:47.960 --> 01:42:49.600]   Inside the beard.
[01:42:49.600 --> 01:42:56.920]   Our show today brought to you by Squarespace, the best place to host your website.
[01:42:56.920 --> 01:42:59.720]   If you go to LeoVille.com, you can see my Squarespace site.
[01:42:59.720 --> 01:43:04.120]   And I can, this is one of those times when I can say out loud, my website, and I don't
[01:43:04.120 --> 01:43:07.000]   have to worry about somebody bringing it to its knees.
[01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:11.760]   This is the cover page feature Squarespace does, which is so nice.
[01:43:11.760 --> 01:43:13.240]   And then you can click into my blog.
[01:43:13.240 --> 01:43:15.960]   In fact, I just posted for another advertiser.
[01:43:15.960 --> 01:43:20.120]   I just posted a list of every audible book I own.
[01:43:20.120 --> 01:43:21.120]   I didn't do it for them.
[01:43:21.120 --> 01:43:26.960]   I just people have been asking me with highlighted entries for the ones I particularly like.
[01:43:26.960 --> 01:43:32.160]   Squarespace lets you change your template, change your look.
[01:43:32.160 --> 01:43:38.240]   The templates are designed to be mobile responsive, which means I can look at it on any size
[01:43:38.240 --> 01:43:39.240]   screen.
[01:43:39.240 --> 01:43:42.240]   In fact, let me reduce the size of this airplay.
[01:43:42.240 --> 01:43:44.400]   I mean of this Safari or Chrome.
[01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:46.720]   And you see it just, it handles it automatically.
[01:43:46.720 --> 01:43:49.160]   It even does something sneaky with the images.
[01:43:49.160 --> 01:43:50.160]   It resettens them.
[01:43:50.160 --> 01:43:53.880]   So my face is in the image, which I think is pretty cool.
[01:43:53.880 --> 01:43:55.720]   Squarespace, they actually analyze the image.
[01:43:55.720 --> 01:43:59.680]   I didn't even, you know, they do stuff that you, it's really just so sweet.
[01:43:59.680 --> 01:44:02.280]   One of those things where you'll go, "Man, these guys know what they're doing."
[01:44:02.280 --> 01:44:07.560]   I want you to go to squarespace.com and you could try it out for yourself right now.

[01:44:13.600 --> 01:44:17.240]   You can, I love it by the way, on this cover page, I found out this, you could put animated
[01:44:17.240 --> 01:44:18.240]   GIFs.
[01:44:18.240 --> 01:44:19.240]   Actually, those are videos.
[01:44:19.240 --> 01:44:21.240]   So you could put anything in there that you want.
[01:44:21.240 --> 01:44:25.480]   This is the animated GIF of me and Gina and Jeff at Google I/O.
[01:44:25.480 --> 01:44:26.600]   And I just love, I think it's fun.
[01:44:26.600 --> 01:44:30.640]   It just kind of brings a site alive.
[01:44:30.640 --> 01:44:35.640]   Simple, powerful, beautiful, a robust platform, a site that will never go down.
[01:44:35.640 --> 01:44:37.040]   Ecommerce, you got it.
[01:44:37.040 --> 01:44:39.360]   Every site comes with powerful ecommerce capabilities.

[01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:42.760]   You don't have to do anything special.
[01:44:42.760 --> 01:44:48.240]   Their great squarespace app makes it easy to blog on iOS or Android or iPad.
[01:44:48.240 --> 01:44:50.240]   I'll probably use it on my iPad Pro.
[01:44:50.240 --> 01:44:52.560]   It might be my new blogging platform.
[01:44:52.560 --> 01:44:55.680]   And of course, incredible support.
[01:44:55.680 --> 01:45:00.560]   A whole page, a whole site devoted to support videos and instructions.
[01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:01.760]   Try it today.
[01:45:01.760 --> 01:45:05.560]   All I ask is when you decide to buy and you will.
[01:45:05.560 --> 01:45:07.080]   You use the off-code Mac break.
[01:45:07.080 --> 01:45:08.840]   You get 10% off.
[01:45:08.840 --> 01:45:15.560]   And if you sign up for the business or commerce account, an additional $100 in AdWords credit.
[01:45:15.560 --> 01:45:16.560]   That's nice.
[01:45:16.560 --> 01:45:18.760]   Squarespace.com.
[01:45:18.760 --> 01:45:19.760]   Squarespace.com.
[01:45:19.760 --> 01:45:24.600]   Use the off-code Mac break.
[01:45:24.600 --> 01:45:25.600]   Squarespace.
[01:45:25.600 --> 01:45:26.600]   Build it.
[01:45:26.600 --> 01:45:27.600]   Beautiful.
[01:45:27.600 --> 01:45:28.600]   Pics of the week.
[01:45:28.600 --> 01:45:29.600]   All right.
[01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:34.480]   Don't keep us in suspense, Mr. D. Jim Dalrymp Ball from Loop Insight.com.
[01:45:34.480 --> 01:45:42.080]   I am going to pick a band called Disturbed.
[01:45:42.080 --> 01:45:49.600]   Disturbed is a great hard rock metal band.
[01:45:49.600 --> 01:45:54.400]   They do a lot of really good just chugging music.
[01:45:54.400 --> 01:45:59.200]   The singer is crazy, but really good.
[01:45:59.200 --> 01:46:01.200]   He's really into the music.
[01:46:01.200 --> 01:46:02.200]   Love it.
[01:46:02.200 --> 01:46:03.200]   Love it.
[01:46:03.200 --> 01:46:10.160]   Put that on and go for a drive and be like a demolition derby out there.
[01:46:10.160 --> 01:46:17.440]   One of their early albums called 10,000 Fists is one of the ones that you should start with.
[01:46:17.440 --> 01:46:21.840]   And it's got a song on there that I think everybody will recognize.
[01:46:21.840 --> 01:46:23.680]   It's called Land of Confusion.
[01:46:23.680 --> 01:46:24.680]   Oh, yeah.
[01:46:24.680 --> 01:46:26.400]   It's a remake of the old Genesis song.
[01:46:26.400 --> 01:46:27.400]   Yeah.
[01:46:27.400 --> 01:46:28.400]   Love that song.
[01:46:28.400 --> 01:46:30.680]   And they do a fantastic job with this song.
[01:46:30.680 --> 01:46:31.960]   It's really, really good.
[01:46:31.960 --> 01:46:32.960]   So start there.
[01:46:32.960 --> 01:46:33.960]   Yeah, baby.
[01:46:33.960 --> 01:46:34.960]   Disturbed.
[01:46:34.960 --> 01:46:38.960]   I'm turning into Jim.
[01:46:38.960 --> 01:46:49.680]   And he and I, that's good.
[01:46:49.680 --> 01:46:51.640]   And they just put out a new album this year.
[01:46:51.640 --> 01:46:56.440]   So you can grab that new one too.
[01:46:56.440 --> 01:46:57.520]   I love it.
[01:46:57.520 --> 01:46:59.280]   Are you an angry person, Jim?
[01:46:59.280 --> 01:47:00.280]   Like you have.
[01:47:00.280 --> 01:47:02.400]   I get all my anger in my music.
[01:47:02.400 --> 01:47:03.400]   I think that's true.
[01:47:03.400 --> 01:47:04.400]   Nice person.
[01:47:04.400 --> 01:47:05.400]   I think that's really true.
[01:47:05.400 --> 01:47:07.520]   You're like the sweetest guy I've ever met.
[01:47:07.520 --> 01:47:08.520]   And I think that that's true.
[01:47:08.520 --> 01:47:13.200]   And then you listen to this agro music, but you're getting out in the agro music.
[01:47:13.200 --> 01:47:15.200]   I get it out, man.
[01:47:15.200 --> 01:47:16.880]   I don't have to worry about anything.
[01:47:16.880 --> 01:47:18.840]   I get it out there.
[01:47:18.840 --> 01:47:19.840]   Brilliant.
[01:47:19.840 --> 01:47:22.600]   I'm going to try that.
[01:47:22.600 --> 01:47:25.120]   Andy and Akko, your pick of the week.
[01:47:25.120 --> 01:47:30.560]   My pick of the week is Plex, the really wonderful media server app.
[01:47:30.560 --> 01:47:35.320]   They just released a version of the Plex app for Apple TV.
[01:47:35.320 --> 01:47:41.040]   So what it is is Plex is a free piece of server software that you put onto any Mac in your
[01:47:41.040 --> 01:47:42.040]   house.
[01:47:42.040 --> 01:47:45.680]   Or if you've got a Synology NAS on the network, you can install it on the network and leave
[01:47:45.680 --> 01:47:47.120]   that running all the time.
[01:47:47.120 --> 01:47:52.680]   And it will just simply make all of your content, your videos, your music, your pictures, everything
[01:47:52.680 --> 01:47:57.920]   available to pretty much any Plex client that you own anywhere in the world.
[01:47:57.920 --> 01:48:04.640]   So it really is, I refer to it as it's a forced multiplier for any sort of a streaming box.
[01:48:04.640 --> 01:48:06.640]   And it's available for just about everything.
[01:48:06.640 --> 01:48:07.720]   I've got it on my Roku.
[01:48:07.720 --> 01:48:13.240]   I've got it on my-- there's Plex clients that come installed on pre-installed on TVs and
[01:48:13.240 --> 01:48:15.000]   that's available for Apple TV.
[01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:20.160]   So wherever you are, whether it's inside your house or in a hotel room, no matter whether
[01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:25.840]   you're through a web browser or a tablet app or a phone app, you can access all of your
[01:48:25.840 --> 01:48:28.160]   videos, all of your music, all your content.
[01:48:28.160 --> 01:48:34.200]   It's such a great thing to have if you are like me in the habit of buying video content
[01:48:34.200 --> 01:48:42.480]   that's free of DRM, like you buy a DVD and you rip it or you buy comedy videos that are
[01:48:42.480 --> 01:48:45.200]   available without DRM.
[01:48:45.200 --> 01:48:48.080]   And suddenly you have all this content that's available everywhere.
[01:48:48.080 --> 01:48:50.120]   It's completely platform agnostic.
[01:48:50.120 --> 01:48:54.540]   And also, like if you're in a hotel room in LA and you've got good internet, you can
[01:48:54.540 --> 01:48:58.160]   just simply decide that I really want to see Moonrise Kingdom, which I have a copy of
[01:48:58.160 --> 01:49:01.200]   on Blu-ray on my server back at home.
[01:49:01.200 --> 01:49:06.120]   And it will-- because your Plex server is logged into Plex and your phone app is logged
[01:49:06.120 --> 01:49:11.120]   into Plex, you can either stream it directly from your home or you can download it.
[01:49:11.120 --> 01:49:16.920]   It also will keep an eye on certain folders so that if you have a TV capture device, it
[01:49:16.920 --> 01:49:21.840]   will automatically-- if you set up a DVR to automatically record stuff and just stash
[01:49:21.840 --> 01:49:26.120]   it in this folder on your Plex server, now suddenly you have a DVR that's-- so you can
[01:49:26.120 --> 01:49:30.960]   get Big Bang Theory or anything over the air recorded and then distribute it to you wherever
[01:49:30.960 --> 01:49:31.960]   you are.
[01:49:31.960 --> 01:49:36.480]   It's one of those really good, just like little tools that if you have that installed, you
[01:49:36.480 --> 01:49:38.040]   will find solutions for it.
[01:49:38.040 --> 01:49:42.320]   And as you continue to learn how to use it, you will find different ways to use it.
[01:49:42.320 --> 01:49:46.200]   The great thing about the Apple TV app, apart from the fact that it makes Apple TV so much
[01:49:46.200 --> 01:49:49.440]   more useful, is the fact that it is a free app.
[01:49:49.440 --> 01:49:52.560]   Normally you have to-- the server app is also free.
[01:49:52.560 --> 01:49:56.840]   Normally for some of the bonus features like the Android app, the iOS app, you have to
[01:49:56.840 --> 01:50:01.200]   have like an annual subscription or a monthly subscription to a service, but the Apple TV
[01:50:01.200 --> 01:50:02.360]   app is completely free.
[01:50:02.360 --> 01:50:06.920]   So once again, you can install this on any Mac in your house or on your Synology NAS.
[01:50:06.920 --> 01:50:12.120]   And now all the Apple TVs in your-- excuse me, all the new Apple TVs in your house will
[01:50:12.120 --> 01:50:16.400]   be able to access every single scrap of content that you have on that server.
[01:50:16.400 --> 01:50:17.400]   That is just awesome.
[01:50:17.400 --> 01:50:20.360]   That makes your Apple TV 10x more powerful.
[01:50:20.360 --> 01:50:21.360]   That's really great.
[01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:28.960]   Yeah, I mean, it's not that I certainly didn't dislike the Apple TV when I first started it
[01:50:28.960 --> 01:50:29.960]   off.
[01:50:29.960 --> 01:50:34.680]   But as soon as that app got loaded in and now I've got just hundreds and hundreds of hours
[01:50:34.680 --> 01:50:40.560]   of TV shows and movies available to me without having to rebuy them all from iTunes, that
[01:50:40.560 --> 01:50:41.560]   was a big win for me.
[01:50:41.560 --> 01:50:42.560]   Yeah.
[01:50:42.560 --> 01:50:43.560]   Yeah.
[01:50:43.560 --> 01:50:46.320]   Renee Ritchie, your pick of the week, my friend.
[01:50:46.320 --> 01:50:50.120]   I have two, but first I want to acknowledge Twitter before it loses its mind because they
[01:50:50.120 --> 01:50:53.440]   keep telling us that T-Mobile has announced that they're going to be streaming Netflix,
[01:50:53.440 --> 01:50:59.080]   HBO Go Now, Hulu, Sling, TV, ESPN, Showtime, and Vivo data free basically.
[01:50:59.080 --> 01:51:02.360]   So you can just stream those without it affecting your data plan.
[01:51:02.360 --> 01:51:06.560]   This is something they've done with music stuff, including Apple Music.
[01:51:06.560 --> 01:51:07.560]   Yeah.
[01:51:07.560 --> 01:51:10.640]   I tell you T-Mobile, there's more and more reasons to use T-Mobile.
[01:51:10.640 --> 01:51:13.600]   That's really, that's really amazing.
[01:51:13.600 --> 01:51:16.360]   They're having a big event going on right now in Los Angeles.
[01:51:16.360 --> 01:51:17.360]   Uncarrier X.
[01:51:17.360 --> 01:51:19.120]   The uncarrier X event.
[01:51:19.120 --> 01:51:20.120]   All right.
[01:51:20.120 --> 01:51:21.600]   Well, thank you for that update.
[01:51:21.600 --> 01:51:23.000]   Now your pick of the week.
[01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:27.040]   So I just want to sort of highlight two apps that make me really excited about the iPad
[01:51:27.040 --> 01:51:28.040]   Pro.
[01:51:28.040 --> 01:51:32.000]   And the first one is CODA 2, which is by our friends at Panic, CableZaster, Evan Mergen,
[01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:33.560]   Stephen Frank, all those guys.
[01:51:33.560 --> 01:51:36.960]   And what it is, they originally made CODA for the Mac.
[01:51:36.960 --> 01:51:40.960]   And I immediately switched away from Dreamweaver, which was like five, seven years ago, and
[01:51:40.960 --> 01:51:45.720]   just used CODA exclusively for web development, because you could have your text, you could
[01:51:45.720 --> 01:51:49.920]   have your FTP, you could have your preview, it would do code, everything that you wanted,
[01:51:49.920 --> 01:51:52.680]   an integrated development environment right on your Mac.
[01:51:52.680 --> 01:51:56.560]   And they had DietCODA, which was the best app name ever on iOS for a while.
[01:51:56.560 --> 01:51:58.160]   And it did some of those things.
[01:51:58.160 --> 01:52:00.200]   But then they managed to get the entire CODA.
[01:52:00.200 --> 01:52:04.320]   I don't know what kind of shoehorn, what kind of shrink ray technology they used.
[01:52:04.320 --> 01:52:08.160]   So they got the entire CODA experience pretty much right onto iOS.
[01:52:08.160 --> 01:52:11.880]   And it works great on the iPhone, like you can see in the video.
[01:52:11.880 --> 01:52:15.760]   Also works great on the iPad, but now with iOS multitasking, and especially the huge
[01:52:15.760 --> 01:52:20.800]   screen on the iPad Pro, you can have CODA running on like 70% of the screen and Safari
[01:52:20.800 --> 01:52:22.600]   running on 30% of the screen.
[01:52:22.600 --> 01:52:25.880]   And it'll push updated previews to Safari.
[01:52:25.880 --> 01:52:29.480]   So you're coding on one side and you're seeing the results on the other side.
[01:52:29.480 --> 01:52:34.000]   And it's not multi-window and they're not overlapping, but it's a really good dual
[01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.120]   display environment.
[01:52:36.120 --> 01:52:38.680]   And if you're used to using CODA, all your sites are there from the Mac.
[01:52:38.680 --> 01:52:41.120]   They've got Panic's version of sync running.
[01:52:41.120 --> 01:52:46.000]   And it's just, it is, this in transmit, it continues to redefine.
[01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:49.840]   You think that the iPad can't really do everything and then a company like Panic comes along
[01:52:49.840 --> 01:52:50.920]   and says, "Oh no, no, no, wait.
[01:52:50.920 --> 01:52:52.920]   You have not seen anything yet."
[01:52:52.920 --> 01:52:56.440]   And I'm so impressed with what they managed to keep doing.
[01:52:56.440 --> 01:53:01.360]   And on the same token, Procreate, which is a savage interactive James Kuda and his team,
[01:53:01.360 --> 01:53:05.600]   they've taken Procreate, which is a phenomenal drawing application and painting application
[01:53:05.600 --> 01:53:10.200]   on the iPad and they've increased it exponentially for the iPad Pro.
[01:53:10.200 --> 01:53:12.320]   All of their tools now work with the pencil.
[01:53:12.320 --> 01:53:17.600]   I forget that you get an enormous amount of pressure sensitivity with it, full tilt support.
[01:53:17.600 --> 01:53:22.400]   They have the canvas now, which I think is 16K by 4K on the iPad Pro.
[01:53:22.400 --> 01:53:24.360]   They've added new effects.
[01:53:24.360 --> 01:53:27.640]   If you wanted to, it'll automatically straighten lines when you draw them.
[01:53:27.640 --> 01:53:32.280]   So if you are any kind of artist and you've just, you've wanted to just draw digitally
[01:53:32.280 --> 01:53:36.720]   the way you could always just paint on a canvas, this, I've used it on the iPad, I'm
[01:53:36.720 --> 01:53:40.480]   using it on the iPad Air 2 right now and I had a chance to try it at the event on the
[01:53:40.480 --> 01:53:42.440]   iPad Pro and early version of it.
[01:53:42.440 --> 01:53:43.440]   And it's just phenomenal.
[01:53:43.440 --> 01:53:47.880]   It's again, one of those things where you take a double take at how well they've managed
[01:53:47.880 --> 01:53:49.400]   to implement it.
[01:53:49.400 --> 01:53:52.520]   So two incredible apps and they're a bunch more coming.
[01:53:52.520 --> 01:53:58.160]   So I'm super thrilled about where the iPad Pro is going.
[01:53:58.160 --> 01:54:02.680]   So you're saying that we don't know what time tonight I can buy the iPad Pro.
[01:54:02.680 --> 01:54:04.400]   It's not soon enough Leo.
[01:54:04.400 --> 01:54:08.440]   But we're going to set the timer for midnight and we're going to wake up every half hour
[01:54:08.440 --> 01:54:09.960]   until we get it.
[01:54:09.960 --> 01:54:11.600]   I have, nope, go back to sleep.
[01:54:11.600 --> 01:54:18.280]   I have, I've priced out, I have to buy three iPad Pros, one for me, one for Megan Moroni's
[01:54:18.280 --> 01:54:20.680]   for iOS today, one for my wife.
[01:54:20.680 --> 01:54:23.280]   Three pencils.
[01:54:23.280 --> 01:54:26.560]   Maybe I can get away with not getting the keyboards, but it's over 3000.
[01:54:26.560 --> 01:54:27.560]   Yeah.
[01:54:27.560 --> 01:54:31.720]   And then, and then we don't know what delivery date will be, but it will be in stores you
[01:54:31.720 --> 01:54:34.200]   say at the end of the week or Apple says at the end of the week, right?
[01:54:34.200 --> 01:54:38.080]   Yes, with my guess is Friday because, you know, that's about as end as you can get.
[01:54:38.080 --> 01:54:44.000]   So with any luck, you and I and whoever else is getting one of them, which is probably
[01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:47.880]   everybody at this table, we'll have one for next week.
[01:54:47.880 --> 01:54:48.880]   Yeah.
[01:54:48.880 --> 01:54:53.240]   And it just made me think of an awesome movie app for people who happen to own three or
[01:54:53.240 --> 01:54:54.240]   maybe five.
[01:54:54.240 --> 01:54:56.840]   I could throw a Cinerama app.
[01:54:56.840 --> 01:54:59.840]   So that that's three scripts in a row.
[01:54:59.840 --> 01:55:02.840]   Listen, how big is the bezel though?
[01:55:02.840 --> 01:55:05.320]   Can we?
[01:55:05.320 --> 01:55:08.280]   Somebody that chat says, why does Lisa need one?
[01:55:08.280 --> 01:55:09.840]   You're not married, are you?
[01:55:09.840 --> 01:55:10.840]   Yeah.
[01:55:10.840 --> 01:55:12.840]   You don't understand.
[01:55:12.840 --> 01:55:15.360]   That's not the question you need to ask.
[01:55:15.360 --> 01:55:18.200]   Here is the Apple just released the iPad Pro first.
[01:55:18.200 --> 01:55:23.480]   I think this is the first at great big universe to get us in the mood.
[01:55:23.480 --> 01:55:25.200]   Oh, God.
[01:55:25.200 --> 01:55:47.560]   Now those people of concerts are going to be even more insufferable.
[01:55:47.560 --> 01:55:48.560]   Yes.
[01:55:48.560 --> 01:55:49.560]   Do not.
[01:55:49.560 --> 01:55:51.680]   Do not hold up your iPad Pro to take pictures.
[01:55:51.680 --> 01:55:53.400]   You can hold the universe in your hand.
[01:55:53.400 --> 01:55:58.400]   The universe do not use it to take pictures, especially a car.
[01:55:58.400 --> 01:56:01.680]   You're going to block the whole freaking stage.
[01:56:01.680 --> 01:56:05.480]   On the other hand, my view was blocked, but at least now I have a big live view that I
[01:56:05.480 --> 01:56:06.480]   could at least look at.
[01:56:06.480 --> 01:56:10.960]   It's not really before a very up a refresh rate.
[01:56:10.960 --> 01:56:15.240]   You just have to tell them, could you zoom in just a little bit so I can see?
[01:56:15.240 --> 01:56:16.240]   Oh, yeah.
[01:56:16.240 --> 01:56:17.240]   You can kind of be kind of cool.
[01:56:17.240 --> 01:56:22.520]   You could actually use it to periscope in there and zoom in on it.
[01:56:22.520 --> 01:56:23.520]   Those speakers sound great.
[01:56:23.520 --> 01:56:25.560]   I mean, Jim's going to enjoy his ACDC on that.
[01:56:25.560 --> 01:56:26.640]   There's four speakers.
[01:56:26.640 --> 01:56:27.640]   Why?
[01:56:27.640 --> 01:56:31.080]   When you rotate it, they actually move at the same time as the screen.
[01:56:31.080 --> 01:56:32.440]   The timing is uncanny.
[01:56:32.440 --> 01:56:33.920]   They did an amazing job.
[01:56:33.920 --> 01:56:38.960]   You just turn it and suddenly the speakers are right where you expect them to be.
[01:56:38.960 --> 01:56:42.440]   So it's stereo even though it has four.
[01:56:42.440 --> 01:56:45.760]   There's some scientific name for it that I'm never going to remember, but it's basically
[01:56:45.760 --> 01:56:49.280]   designed to always give you great sound no matter which way you turn it or how fast.
[01:56:49.280 --> 01:56:50.680]   Left will always be left.
[01:56:50.680 --> 01:56:52.680]   Can't wait.
[01:56:52.680 --> 01:56:53.960]   Well we'll talk about it next week.
[01:56:53.960 --> 01:56:56.160]   I want to thank all of you guys for being here.
[01:56:56.160 --> 01:57:01.720]   Jim Dowl-Rimple from the loop-loop-insight.com at J-Dowl-Rimple.
[01:57:01.720 --> 01:57:05.000]   On Twitter, if you don't know how to spell it, you don't deserve to follow him.
[01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:06.560]   Thank you, Jim.
[01:57:06.560 --> 01:57:08.760]   Always a pleasure.
[01:57:08.760 --> 01:57:09.760]   Are you stealing cable?
[01:57:09.760 --> 01:57:11.480]   Because I'm looking over your left shoulder there.
[01:57:11.480 --> 01:57:12.880]   I'm not going to say it doesn't.
[01:57:12.880 --> 01:57:15.520]   Okay, never mind.
[01:57:15.520 --> 01:57:18.760]   That's probably just power to your Christmas lights that are lighting the gazillion.
[01:57:18.760 --> 01:57:19.760]   Oh yeah.
[01:57:19.760 --> 01:57:20.760]   Yeah.
[01:57:20.760 --> 01:57:28.960]   Well, I put up this fake lattice because living under the overpass in San Jose, I didn't want
[01:57:28.960 --> 01:57:32.640]   to show my neighbor Bob and his virgin air ball.
[01:57:32.640 --> 01:57:37.840]   So you've got to play around your socks at the end of the night so you don't get that
[01:57:37.840 --> 01:57:39.480]   train foot problem.
[01:57:39.480 --> 01:57:43.360]   Thanks to the homeless, Jim Dowl-Rimple.
[01:57:43.360 --> 01:57:46.440]   Thank you to the Canadians.
[01:57:46.440 --> 01:57:47.440]   Renee Ritchie as well.
[01:57:47.440 --> 01:57:48.440]   I'm more.com.
[01:57:48.440 --> 01:57:50.480]   Great to have you once again.
[01:57:50.480 --> 01:57:51.480]   Thank you.
[01:57:51.480 --> 01:57:52.480]   Renee.
[01:57:52.480 --> 01:57:54.200]   You don't want to go to the store again?
[01:57:54.200 --> 01:57:56.120]   You're going to get it online and then go to the store probably.
[01:57:56.120 --> 01:57:57.520]   You probably do both, won't you?
[01:57:57.520 --> 01:58:01.040]   No, I mean, I don't want to encourage anybody to pre-order it and then return it if they
[01:58:01.040 --> 01:58:02.600]   can get it at the store faster.
[01:58:02.600 --> 01:58:04.920]   But, you know, UPS is UPS.
[01:58:04.920 --> 01:58:10.480]   And of course, Andy Enoco from the Chicago Sun Times and his brand new MacBook.
[01:58:10.480 --> 01:58:11.480]   Yep.
[01:58:11.480 --> 01:58:16.840]   It's nice to have, at least for the first week, a keyboard that's not filled with tiny, tiny
[01:58:16.840 --> 01:58:20.120]   little arm hairs in it.
[01:58:20.120 --> 01:58:23.360]   It's a perennial problem for us furries.
[01:58:23.360 --> 01:58:31.600]   You'll find Andy's writing on the Sun Times but also his newly invigorated blog, CWOB.com.
[01:58:31.600 --> 01:58:32.960]   Thanks to Mars Edit.
[01:58:32.960 --> 01:58:36.600]   It's actually made it easier and more fun to blog so I'm doing more of that.
[01:58:36.600 --> 01:58:39.520]   I saw Daniel tweeting you about all of that.
[01:58:39.520 --> 01:58:40.960]   He's so great.
[01:58:40.960 --> 01:58:41.960]   Yeah.
[01:58:41.960 --> 01:58:42.960]   Love Daniel.
[01:58:42.960 --> 01:58:45.240]   Thanks to our audience for being here.
[01:58:45.240 --> 01:58:50.480]   We do this show every Tuesday, 11 AM Pacific, 2 PM Eastern Time, 1800 UTC.
[01:58:50.480 --> 01:58:52.600]   And our studio audience is just now arriving.
[01:58:52.600 --> 01:58:54.360]   So that's exciting.
[01:58:54.360 --> 01:58:56.200]   You might want to get here when the show begins.
[01:58:56.200 --> 01:58:59.720]   Hey, maybe you're coming for security now because that's coming up next.
[01:58:59.720 --> 01:59:01.800]   You can email us at tickets@tikasatuit.tv.
[01:59:01.800 --> 01:59:04.720]   Carla will put a chair out for you.

[01:59:18.360 --> 01:59:20.960]   And does Apple Music have pot?
[01:59:20.960 --> 01:59:21.960]   No.
[01:59:21.960 --> 01:59:22.960]   Oh, well.
[01:59:22.960 --> 01:59:23.960]   Stitcher does.
[01:59:23.960 --> 01:59:24.960]   Spotify does.
[01:59:24.960 --> 01:59:25.960]   We're on Spotify.

[01:59:32.280 --> 01:59:36.040]   Now get back to work because you know what, break time is over.
