[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.040]   We're at the Met Gala Wow
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:13.880]   Nice also with us Andy and I call let's see who he's plugging today good man. Let's see you bolder buffs
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.640]   Hello
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.280]   Renee does this does this mean that like there's like a YouTube cinematic universe like you and Marquez are like
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.920]   I think so one one mega event away from like being in the same
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.200]   It's definitely gala. It's definitely a
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.560]   World unto itself really
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:39.320]   These days I mean the YouTube stars are kind of in their own they are in their own universe
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.080]   It's very I can't I can't give names
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:48.360]   But I've heard of a couple really big events recently where they had like you know like like people at the top of Hollywood the top of the tech
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.320]   Industry and then the top youtubers like all just in the same room at the same time
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.840]   They've done even Met Gala was like that but but I have to say crossovers not easy
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.160]   For some reason I just ask annoying orange
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:06.440]   It's true and for a while YouTube had a fetish with the traditional stars
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.880]   They would all the top right video like and they didn't late night. I couldn't make it Jimmy's yep
[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:17.160]   I mean, I guess John Krasinski sort of is with his during COVID, but I really feel like it's its own
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.880]   Universe with its own stars anyway, I don't know that's just a
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:26.360]   No, no, you're right, but with YouTube you never get out you never get a day off
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:32.640]   All the people who do well are like no no no no no we're not skipping this week. We're not skipping today
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.000]   Oh, yeah, we're putting out something well and I live my life at I'm war so nothing changed
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.800]   It's sort of the same for a tick-tock like my son's trying to cross over
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.680]   Into YouTube as I have urged him to do for some time. Yeah way better monetization
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.160]   And well, maybe maybe yes, maybe no
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:54.160]   You tiktok some some people are making money. He visited
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.760]   I don't know who was a tiktok or seven million dollar house over the weekend and his garage full of cars
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:05.600]   So somebody's making money, but yeah, it's all hand. Yeah, it's not sharing the money
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.520]   They're not sharing it
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:13.740]   Well, they shared it with this guy. I have to ask saltman co it was but he's only got 20,000 YouTube subscribers
[00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:20.740]   So he's got he's got a little ways to go. It's good. That's good, right? It's not zero. Yeah, he's only got a few videos so far
[00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:22.740]   He's just he's working on it
[00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:30.320]   It's hard though. It's hard. I think to cross over I think you're each is its own thing Instagram it took time not so hard
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:36.800]   And also frankly, you know those seven cars. I'm not sure that I'd want to have a job that required that much driving
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.000]   I
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.080]   Mean having to drive from house to house building to building. I mean, that's just I did what I what kind of life is
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.960]   I did tell Hank that if he makes a lot of money, please do not invest in cars. Yeah
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.000]   Generally a bad
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   On the other hand if you were to invest your money into some mint in the box
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.800]   iPod touches right now. You might be you might be pretty loaded
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:09.860]   You might don't touch those Renee don't even open them. Don't unseal them. How many do you have? I?
[00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.840]   Got two mint in the box iPod touches here for some reason
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.160]   I don't know why I never opened them and I've got like the open versions
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:21.060]   I have the open gold version too, but it's out of reach. Wow the man is flush very duplicative
[00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:26.840]   But this is my past iPod and it is now official that after 21 years
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:33.960]   It's the end of the line for iPod Apple announced today that the iPod touch will be available while supplies last
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:40.840]   The music lives on Leo the music lives on I guess the music I guess they must have a few in the warehouse
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.600]   Yeah, that's that's such good marketing saying no no
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:48.200]   We're not we're not we're not end of life and discontinuing a product that we're having
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:53.080]   Most people wondered why was there was a prize where we're still on the on the price list anyway
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:06:00.060]   We're oh no. No, this is a limited edition opportunity to be in on the end of a term of legend
[00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:04.600]   They should have made it at least people are fighting for home like for the original home pods now
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:08.120]   They can't they're harder and harder to get and people like just give them to us give them to us
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:13.260]   They're fighting over them like they're tickle me elmo dolls or something so music is always this is great. Jaws
[00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.840]   We act jaws now of a senior vice president of worldwide marketing
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:21.740]   He took Schiller's role music has always been part of our core at Apple bringing hundreds of millions of users in the way
[00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.120]   iPod did impact it more than just the music industry
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:30.280]   This is actually sounds like hyperbole, but I think it's fair. It also redefined how music is discovered
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:34.540]   Listened to and shared today the spirit of iPod lives on
[00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:40.580]   I don't know if that's true. We've integrated an incredible music experience across all of our products
[00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:45.460]   My phone to the Apple watch to home pod many and across Mac iPad Apple TV. So
[00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:48.020]   Bye-bye
[00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:53.700]   It was introduced October 23rd 2001. I vividly remember that day
[00:06:53.700 --> 00:07:00.140]   It went through a lot of iterations the shuffle remember the shuffle
[00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:08.180]   Remember the the chewing gum buttonless shuffle the buttonless shuffle the iPod touch was the last version wide nano
[00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:15.660]   Remember this one the little clip on for sports. That's a very cool. Yeah
[00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:19.040]   What what killed the iPod touch was it just a
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:22.740]   What a feature it's a feature
[00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:29.780]   iPod touch the feature was 200 so much two hundred seventy nine bucks
[00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:36.860]   What was it I don't remember what it got down to cut down really low it is did it okay?
[00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:42.260]   It's basically an iPhone 5 like that thing is ancient. Yeah, but it was a good choice for kids
[00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:46.780]   The even one of I'm an iPhone, but you wanted to give them something
[00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:54.820]   Yeah, but it just became like Renee said just a real technological relic and even even the standalone iPods
[00:07:54.820 --> 00:08:01.380]   They for a long time they had a really important niche meaning that there are people who are out running
[00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:06.620]   They're people who are exercising who don't want like a thousand dollar phone or five hundred dollar phone filing out falling in their pocket
[00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:08.340]   To say nothing of the of all that weight
[00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:16.400]   But this beautiful little clip design that would have either a really cheap iPod that could do that could play all that digital rights managed
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:24.340]   iTunes content that they purchased or even this this poster stamp thing with a screen and a user interface that could have like Nike fitness apps on it
[00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:26.340]   That was a hell of a hell of an object
[00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:33.860]   I was a real moment for Apple design because this is I've I'm really intrigued by what Apple's
[00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:39.180]   design people can do when they're not constrained by form factors that are kind of
[00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:41.100]   dictated by
[00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:46.660]   Conventions where you can say nope. I'll be all we really need is a play and a pause button above that go nuts
[00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:53.420]   But then of course, but the the solution to the hey, I'm exercising and I want to be able to listen to music became
[00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:58.300]   Became Apple Watch plus AirPods and so even that was a sound of the market
[00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:03.860]   They couldn't compete with all the super super cheap stuff that was out there for people who actually wanted something that if it fell
[00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:07.380]   Off there if it fell off their their their t-shirt while they're running, you know
[00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:13.020]   Get a $20 thing from all the express or for from no name Amazon because you won't care about it
[00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:19.060]   Otherwise, yeah, you don't want to lose your Apple watch. Yeah right now. They're selling the 32 gig
[00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:24.980]   iPod touch for 200 bucks. Yeah, yeah 300 bucks for 128 gigs
[00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:32.060]   $400 no wonder they're killing this product for 256 gigs and you probably you know
[00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:35.140]   You have an iPhone that's got at least 32 gigs free floating around
[00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:41.020]   I can't see even buying a 32 gig version of this for a kid the kid would be insulted
[00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:45.620]   Developer camp was probably the last camera used them for was to buy 30 for a developer camp or something. Yeah
[00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:47.620]   Yeah, yeah, and also
[00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:52.180]   You want you want to talk about living in shame posting to Instagram with
[00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:54.500]   2000 with a
[00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:56.380]   iPhone 5 level camera on it. Yeah
[00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:02.780]   Yeah, you got to wonder why the thing is I always try to measure my complaints about things because you never know
[00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:10.180]   It's it'd be easy to say. Oh gosh. That was I can't believe they still sell that but there's probably a really real esoteric reason
[00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:12.980]   Why they were selling it that there was some market somewhere?
[00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:18.060]   That's that insisted that hey we need we need something to run iOS apps, but it can't be a phone
[00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:22.980]   It can't have a cellular radio in it and they kept it on the marks because it got a gun
[00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:33.840]   Well, you know Apple Apple has a camera. Yeah Apple actually will sell like a government an actual iPhone with actual iPhone branding on it
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:40.500]   That simply has all the it has a flat a flat a flat plane on the back of it instead of a cover with the iPhone's on it
[00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:45.300]   So again, I keep and given how much cost to just to do tooling on any new product
[00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:51.740]   It's so I wonder who it was who was buying just enough of these or what contract they had that required that
[00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:56.620]   Hey, if you're gonna operate in this market, you must also offer it amongst your product line a product that does this
[00:10:56.620 --> 00:11:03.140]   That said, you know what it is just paying the fines would cost more than just keeping this one little tiny product on the
[00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:05.500]   Overordered they over ordered and took them to you
[00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:14.180]   Well in a way it said I mean the iPod really was a transformational object when it came out 2001
[00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:20.620]   There were other MP3 players, but they were big they were clunky. They were unusable. What was that thing? Nope?
[00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:27.140]   No, mad. That was the famous slash dot response to the I oh, yeah iPod was it's not a nomad lame. Yeah, I
[00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:29.780]   Had a diamond Rio
[00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:32.140]   That was close to an iPod
[00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:39.540]   But let's not if you want to listen to the car you had to have you know a head unit with a trunk full of hard drives in the back
[00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:46.540]   Yeah, it was it's that's a long and wonderful fight the RAA try to have the diamond Rio
[00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:52.940]   Actually banned for sale rendered illegal saying that because it was a playback device for digital content
[00:11:52.940 --> 00:12:00.340]   Right and because the only the only way you could possibly get digital content was downloading it illegally because God got knows the technology for
[00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:04.180]   Converting a CD to an mp3 did not exist. Of course it did they said no
[00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:10.500]   It's only it's only device for piracy and they got damn close to having getting injunction to saying let's get to getting that thing
[00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:14.220]   Band and that was even this tiny little ropey. What was it a six?
[00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:18.580]   It didn't even it didn't even hold like a full CD's worth of content and that's that like
[00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:25.100]   Ancient like sticks and animal skins strapped together level of music
[00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:30.340]   Actually, I use it for audiobooks because it could play audible books. That's the that was the manors and I had diamond Rio
[00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:37.300]   All of that superseded by the iPod and it didn't how long do you remember how long it took for the iPod to take off?
[00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:40.620]   It feels like to me. It was an instant. It was an overnight. It was windows, right?
[00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:45.180]   It was it was always when yes, because it didn't support windows at first did it
[00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:49.380]   No, and so as I recall it was it was a big hit with nerds
[00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:57.100]   But a $500 music player competing with what was then 200 the big deal was the hard drive because it was the first really effective hard drive
[00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:02.140]   base player the people who are really digital music hadn't really taken off the RAA had a
[00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:06.580]   Point in that where most people were getting digital music back then wasn't by ripping CDs
[00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:10.060]   It was by going through limewire or Napster or someplace else
[00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:13.780]   But the it was a slow it was a slow take off
[00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:18.460]   But once it took off once once people discovered digital music once the tools for creating
[00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:24.900]   Creating your own music files from CDs took off. That's when things really really hit and I imagine
[00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:32.380]   Once you have windows you need you need to the windows version in order to you can't make a you can't make a lot of money by selling to just
[00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:39.500]   8 to 9% of the entire world p world desktop market you have to if you want a lot of the monies in the pockets of windows people
[00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:42.100]   And it was so big grudging like he's so what didn't want it
[00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:44.980]   They had to convince him to do it and he's like fine if you do it
[00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:46.980]   It's on you if it doesn't take off it's your fault
[00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:52.660]   And then he came out with that double cable is like the windows machines that USB is not powerful enough to actually even charge it
[00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:57.020]   You got to put two cables on the back of your windows one and we want to add a tax to the Mac users
[00:13:57.020 --> 00:14:02.060]   We're gonna charge that cable separately. It was just the whole thing was like you can always tell when Steve was slightly angry
[00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:09.900]   Tony Fidell whose book just came out actually good timing on the book Tony was the original designer hired by John Rubenstein
[00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:16.700]   Formerly it from General Magic and Phillips he had done the Phillips Vello PDA
[00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:19.420]   the Nino PDA
[00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:24.820]   Rubenstein had discovered a Toshiba little tiny quarter-sized Toshiba hard drive
[00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:31.520]   While meeting with an Apple supplier in Japan bought the rights for it and the question was now what do we do?
[00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:34.360]   Fidell hired in
[00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:41.360]   2001 as an independent contractor to work on the project then code name of a reading from Wikipedia P68
[00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:48.080]   He hired engineers from his startup fuse veteran engineers from General Magic and Phillips
[00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:50.840]   They had to do it in about eight months
[00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:53.040]   Yeah, didn't have a lot of time
[00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:59.440]   They bought so much stuff off the shelf even the OS even the software was off the shelf that they've been modified for their own uses
[00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:02.800]   The aesthetic inspired by the 1958
[00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:08.000]   Brown T3 transistor radio designed by the legendary Deeter Rams
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:14.440]   The wheelbase user interface prompted by banging all of since Beo comm 6000 telephone
[00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:21.400]   Pixo another company designed the user interface did a good job, right? But it wasn't designed inside Apple
[00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:28.080]   Although Steve I think had a lot to say about it. He's said to have dropped a prototype into an aquarium in
[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:36.440]   Front of engineers to demonstrate from bubbles leaving its housing that there is internal space to be saved. That's so savage
[00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:39.320]   also, yes, that's the
[00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:45.960]   The other the other story I remember from that from the development was that like again that this is they had a deadline and also
[00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:48.640]   Apple did not have infinite resources at that point
[00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:55.840]   They would they'd basically learn to start treading water at that point recovering from the crisis that they were in and they were and
[00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:00.000]   Steve rejected rejected one of these prototypes because it had a green display
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.400]   What it was typical at the time a green backlit LCD display?
[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:07.680]   They said no no this has a look and there's nothing green on this device
[00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:10.360]   It has to be white and so they had to somehow source
[00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:18.320]   From absolutely out of nowhere though the a very very rare like white backlit display for this like Steve
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:23.200]   We don't have time for this. We're we're building a life raft
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:28.080]   It doesn't matter like where we put the viewports for this there are not gonna be any windows
[00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:33.600]   We're trying to get off this island and survive a guy named Vinnie Chico or Chico
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:37.160]   Freelance copywriter who had been hired
[00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:40.960]   as a contractor by Apple to figure out how to
[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:43.640]   introduce this new thing
[00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:49.160]   To the public gave it the name iPod after Chico saw prototype
[00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:54.800]   He thought of the movie 2001 and the phrase open the pod bay doors. How I?
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:17:00.280]   Had no idea that we call ourselves a podcast because of
[00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:02.920]   2001 a space Odyssey
[00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:04.440]   Why Leo?
[00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:07.200]   I'm sorry Dave. I can't do that
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:13.760]   It's the EVA pods of the Discovery one spaceship and of course how never did open those doors
[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:19.960]   Wow now that same legacy is reflected in Siri because that's no series catchphrase
[00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:29.580]   Five gigabyte hard drive that was of course the tagline a thousand mechanical hard drive in your pocket a mechanical
[00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:32.760]   Tchaiba hard drive a thousand songs in your pocket
[00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:37.680]   They were really good the messaging though the meshing was so simple a dollar a song a thousand songs in your pocket the entire way through
[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:43.400]   It was that the experience was so clean and I think he was right like to compete with the Napsters and all of the free downloads
[00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:46.480]   You had to make it easy. That was the only way you were gonna ever compete with them
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:49.320]   And that got him a lot of buy-in a lot of product traction. Yeah
[00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:55.720]   We really do have him to think for that because we forget about how hard how horrified a lot of these
[00:17:55.720 --> 00:18:02.560]   Companies were about digital music to begin with Sony you would think they've they created the Walkman
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:08.920]   They created this product category and their solution was because because they were their own music distributors
[00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:15.920]   They had they started putting copy protection on CDs that would that would install essentially malware on every single PC
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:22.160]   That this this was inserted to to make it really difficult to rip the CD and they also created this
[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:28.920]   The age if you bought if you paid the money if you'd given them your money to own a Sony digital music player
[00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:35.760]   The software that was required to install music on it would instantly take a look grab all of your mp3s
[00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:41.820]   Convert them into a lock proprietary Sony format and I'm talking about the stuff you already own the stuff that you would already
[00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:48.520]   Legally actually converted from CD and made you sign it in and sign it out when you put it into the player
[00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:55.280]   This is the the the the strum are just just like we have the whole world has Steve Jobs to thank for the idea of
[00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:59.020]   Phone carriers no longer ordering phone manufacturers
[00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:02.520]   Here is the device that we want you to build for us here are the limitations
[00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:07.680]   We are going to put on you so that you don't stress our network that was Steve Jobs talked them out of that
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:12.320]   Steve Jobs had to talk an apple had to talk the music industry down from look
[00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:18.920]   People are either going to be getting your music illegally because you're not making it easy or even possible to get it digitally
[00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:23.560]   Or they're going to be buying it from you through the iTunes store. We have to make it easy
[00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:27.440]   We have to make it simple. I understand that even the argument about copy protection was
[00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:34.560]   Wasn't I don't think it was a fighting point but it was something that Apple didn't want but had to exceed two because otherwise
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:36.960]   They're not going to actually get there again. There's so
[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:42.240]   Eventually they wore them did but yeah, they wore them down on copy protection and for better or worse
[00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:46.360]   Steve said you got to be able to sell your songs
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:52.320]   Individually and a lot of this is for better for worse because a lot of artists still bemoan the loss of the album
[00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:58.680]   You know as a kind of work of art as a coherent whole but really as soon as the night
[00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:00.680]   chapters on YouTube
[00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:06.840]   Right as yeah chapters screw them as soon as 99 cents songs came out by your book by chapters
[00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:10.040]   Right people people bought start buying individual songs
[00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:12.240]   It was really the end of the album as a work of art
[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:18.440]   I think which was good and bad because some artists really put a lot of love and value and thought and preparedness into an album
[00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:21.920]   And some were like well, we need one or two hit some it was shovel yeah
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:23.920]   Yeah, and then just fill it up
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:24.280]   Yeah
[00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:30.760]   And that maybe that is as much responsible for the for the demise of the album as as Steve Jobs frankly
[00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:37.120]   Because a lot of albums are crap. I bought my sister back in 2006 the YouTube remember the YouTube version
[00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:44.200]   Yeah, I had a black back a red front. It only had 30 gigs, but it came when I say YouTube YouTube
[00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:47.200]   You - we're talking about Bono
[00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:54.200]   I came with I think did it come with the entire YouTube
[00:20:54.200 --> 00:21:01.360]   I think I think it did I remember I was at the event so I got I got great
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:04.720]   I got great like fourth row pictures of like a bono edge
[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:11.280]   Yeah, this was before people got mad about Apple preloading you to yeah, this was back in 2006 with people like you to still
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:16.720]   Right actually I like him again after after Bono and edge played the edge played in the subway and
[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:18.320]   Keve
[00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:21.840]   Over the weekend. So yeah, that was a class that was an iPod
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:25.920]   I don't know how long was available, but I think if you had an in-the-box you - iPod that might be worth
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:33.240]   Something with the white headphones like the all that's the other thing they made white headphones a signature
[00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:34.440]   Yeah
[00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:39.160]   Everybody else's headphones were black you knew immediately somebody had an iPod you sit on the subway
[00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:45.240]   There's the white headphones and of course I don't know if they did that do you think they were smart enough to say that's that's gonna
[00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:52.200]   Be our signature the white headphones. They did by the time of dance to lean into their like it seems like Steve was also very good at leaning in
[00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:56.320]   To constraints like the things that he had to put up with like I remember like with snow leopard
[00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:59.840]   They were saying he's like there's not enough new features. There's no way I'm going up on stage and embarrassing myself
[00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:04.360]   But what if we said there's no new features? Okay? There's no new features here's the here's the
[00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:10.840]   Iconic dancing iPod ads where you see those white headphones in fact, it's the only color
[00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:14.640]   It's all silhouettes the dancers and they're holding their white iPod in the white
[00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:20.280]   Headphones it really became a signature trade of era for their ad. This is 2006 this came out
[00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:26.000]   Yeah, so how about how about this for for amazing that the HP they actually licensed it to HP
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.560]   So there was an HP branded. Yeah, I remember that that flopped right
[00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:35.280]   Yeah, but still was it was a real iPod. It was what an early fan boys
[00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:37.960]   Yeah out there
[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:42.160]   Let me see if I can find the first iPod ad I think this is it
[00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:44.600]   Here let me turn the sound on go ahead
[00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:50.040]   This is the guy sitting at a classic white
[00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:55.240]   MacBook he's got a bunch of CDs in front of us. He's rocking out
[00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:57.460]   He's he's
[00:22:57.460 --> 00:23:01.820]   Waking them what updating songs on what an iPod?
[00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:08.640]   Firewire baby and now a thousand songs in his pocket
[00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:13.000]   That's pretty awesome pretty awesome
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.880]   very first time
[00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:22.400]   And I hope the music in history does forgive us the use of whatever song I'm blanking on his name
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:25.120]   But there was that fashion icon they were talking about recently
[00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:31.200]   Who had like a thousand iPods with like little labels on them with all his different music all the time loaded up for him
[00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:37.280]   Wow, yeah, well, I think my favorite iPod was this one and John let me this one
[00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:43.720]   This is the iPod classic and this was the one with a hundred sixty gigs, which at the time was massive
[00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:46.280]   still a little hard drive in here and
[00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:50.640]   I bought several one I got got
[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:56.200]   A pair that I could exchange with my mom so I put stuff on it sent it to her
[00:23:56.200 --> 00:24:00.760]   She'd send the old one back and I put new stuff on it. I hope she still has those
[00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:05.920]   John you carry this is you use this in your car, right? This is your yeah, yeah
[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:11.740]   It was a great story about the Lord of the Rings last movie was so big it couldn't fit on anything except an iPod classic
[00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:13.600]   I had a hundred sixty five bird to the studio
[00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:18.520]   Yeah, so they put the return of the king on this iPod and then they'd walk it to the fiber optic station every day
[00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:22.760]   And a couple times I thought people were following them and they would just like hurry run across or put on some
[00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:27.120]   Rock out. Yeah, they were so big. Yeah, it was it was a great
[00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:32.160]   It was a great value because it was people forget how much this it really lived up to the name iPod
[00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:36.200]   Right at the time. I really thought geez isn't that interesting where number one?
[00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:39.080]   They're not specifically labeling in a music player number two
[00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:43.800]   There's nothing even the fact that here is the play pause button the most important thing on a music player
[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:49.960]   It was this tiny little gray silk screen on a white background on one of these little orbital buttons
[00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:57.760]   And they really eventually made it into a container for what have you that it was a hard drive if you connected it to your
[00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:03.160]   To your system so that yeah, it was a great way to sort of put you needed a hard drive for work
[00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:05.360]   But you wanted your boss to buy you like a really
[00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:11.560]   Sophisticated music player iPod, but also it was a great demo of I sync because it could then sync notes. It could sync
[00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:18.920]   It could sync calendar contacts stuff like that eventually it had a screen tiny screen, but you could watch movies on right?
[00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:23.700]   Yeah, I mean, I don't know if anybody did but I remember putting TV shows on my
[00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:30.680]   I might watch them they kept making a big deal of when when video came to iTunes that hey look
[00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:35.440]   Here's the best but here's here's how to watch Shrek on your on your on a tiny little screen
[00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:42.200]   That's about even smaller than a phone screen. Yeah, but it but it looked great all of this changed in 2007 when the iPhone came out
[00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:46.480]   Yeah, or at least started the iPod into a button it was literally a button on the iPhone interface
[00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:49.080]   Yeah, they called it an iPod and of course Steve Jobs
[00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:54.120]   Famously, you know, it's an internet. It's a what do you say a communicator iPod? It's a phone
[00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:56.480]   It's an iPod internet
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:26:03.120]   Communication yeah, but yeah all three right and that really I think you know if if you look back to the beginning of the end
[00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:07.400]   As long ago as that was 15 years ago was you know the beginning of the end?
[00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:13.080]   I think that's what Tony said in his book like they were working on these three projects like they were working on the touchscreen project
[00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:18.600]   They were working on the white screen iPod project and they were working on the the like the phone sort of project
[00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:23.760]   And then they realized it really was the same thing. It was an educated device that was their biggest threat in the market
[00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:24.920]   Yeah
[00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:31.180]   But that's where apples always excel to the willingness to kind of eat their children and whoa, I don't know what's happening
[00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:37.560]   Oh, are you putting you're putting it? We're gonna have a little we're gonna have a little background dancing
[00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:45.760]   Moves though I have those moves I you know the other thing this those ads sold records
[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:50.040]   I mean if you got on if you were lucky enough to have a song on an iPod commercial
[00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:56.160]   I remember the one with a one two three or an app later Apple commercials. They really sold records
[00:26:56.160 --> 00:27:02.400]   That was a great way to think of the same one. Yeah, I still I still have music and when I go whenever go through the folder of my
[00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:07.680]   Musical library. That's just like I call it orphan tracks ones that don't belong darn part of like a whole album
[00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:10.160]   But I own it's like she where that come from. Oh, that's right
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:13.600]   It was it was an I it was an iPod ad and I liked it so much that I had to have it
[00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:17.720]   There's a song by jet that was used that was like that was like my jam for the entire year
[00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:21.280]   This was the first ad to say the very end Mac or
[00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:27.640]   PC that was around what was that 2005 and then in 2006
[00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:31.880]   See if you recognize the dancers in the upcoming ad
[00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:36.280]   Because I think this is when the
[00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:43.800]   This is a great. Oh, this is not the one I was thinking of this is a great here. It is great YouTube. Here we go
[00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:46.600]   Oh, yeah, yep. Oh, yeah
[00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:49.560]   Great YouTube every apple iPod ad ever
[00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:56.000]   2000 the Coldplay one was terrific as well. Was there a Coldplay iPod?
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:04.120]   No, but they had an iTunes or iPod. Oh really interesting. Look at this. Wow. I put I put a link to my there's a flicker
[00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:09.560]   Flicker album online of my pictures from from the YouTube event. It was oh
[00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:16.080]   Look at that. I put that I put that in the show notes if you want to use this is it is Bono and
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:21.840]   The Edge stop performing for us and silently again. Thank you music industry for making it
[00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:29.800]   Impossible play any music even if it's newsworthy on our shows and artists you can thank your labels for
[00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:33.680]   Eliminating the chance to get any promotion at all
[00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:38.560]   From a mr. Show. Yeah, the other the other cool iPod thing there
[00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:44.960]   what what an effort what Apple anniversary was it where they they gave away post like really nice art posters of
[00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:50.120]   The Macintosh lady from the Mac the 1984 commercial again the iconic
[00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:52.160]   Frame when she's got the slight chamber
[00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:59.640]   She's running through the aisle with the apple with a Macintosh t-shirt in but they added digitally added in like iPods and iPod headphones
[00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:01.640]   And an iPod clip to her waist
[00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:04.920]   My wall in another room, that's right
[00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:08.560]   The weird thing is right now like you can get a ton of music on TikTok
[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:10.880]   And I think YouTube shorts is starting to do that as well
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:14.880]   So the obviously some better they make deals some very narrow use cases they make deals
[00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:22.080]   Here was the here was the iPod that you might have watched Shrek on get ready for this one is coming up here
[00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:31.000]   Yeah, there it is. Yeah. Yeah, that's it was a very weird fatty iPod because it had a yeah
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:35.040]   It lasted a year it only lasted a year really wow. Yeah
[00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:38.360]   The old one nine to five Mac
[00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:43.320]   Famously leaked and got into whole brew. Hah ha about the sort of thing made them famous at the same time. Yeah
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:47.120]   I really didn't want to watch videos on that. I'm sorry
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:55.440]   The the whole the whole thing was like sink sink everything onto the thing
[00:29:55.440 --> 00:30:00.040]   Yeah, and also it was it was kind of magical when episode one of
[00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:06.720]   the Star Wars like obviously obviously I had to like start waiting in line like outside the theater
[00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:09.960]   I had my ticket I already I'd already gotten in line eight ten hours earlier
[00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:13.760]   Two months ago to buy but to buy my tickets the first showing first day
[00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:16.920]   But I had to get in line like ten hours earlier. I loaded up
[00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:23.400]   I think I had a palm device and I think I might have had I'd have to check to see if it was an iPod thing
[00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:29.560]   But I had the entire like original trilogy loaded up on these devices just watching it on these tiny screens
[00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:37.160]   And it was so it's it's hard for generations to understand what a weird and wonderful thing that was where now
[00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:42.920]   We just stream whatever it is to whatever device we have the idea of not only having it in a digital format to begin with
[00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:46.600]   Instead of like on DVD or on some sort of physical physical media
[00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:49.920]   But also this device in my pocket. I can just sit here
[00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:53.480]   I think there I think there were people who actually brought a TV and a VCR
[00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:57.960]   To enjoy it and entertainer the people in lobby, but I'm like screw that it's just for me
[00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:03.080]   Tony's up that would have been a big deal Tony Fadel tweeted
[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:08.320]   Anyone want to see what I unearthed when I cleaned out my garage and found photos of everything I've ever made
[00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:12.560]   In six full boxes full-home depot
[00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:21.640]   Looks like he's got a few exercise items to the no longer uses
[00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:29.680]   Let's anyway iPod it's been a really great 20 years. Thank you. Yeah, raise a glass to you, sir
[00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:38.760]   Yeah, it's still that last one one last a clip for that that it does the the product lines the product category still exists
[00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:45.520]   But now it's in the form of these thousand dollar two thousand dollar like high-end audio file like
[00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:50.200]   audio players that are the size of like a TV remote control from like
[00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:56.240]   1988 but but they've got to tell you that oh no no no this is this will do this will unwrap the
[00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:05.120]   Like 320 k bits per second like 96 bit wide path look at look at look at the alloy metal
[00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:10.560]   We made all the interconnects inside the device of we've got a totally isolated audio path between them
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:13.600]   I mean, it's like yeah, I think you've kind of lost the plot
[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:21.000]   I still I do have a Sony a 55 like digital Walkman because I do like the idea of having my entire music library on one device
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.440]   And I can't afford like a one terabyte phone or at least as of two years ago
[00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:28.760]   I couldn't so it's an interesting category, but it's nice that it's it's still there
[00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:34.560]   There's still people out there so if you want if the the the the sad irony is that if you want an iPod shuffle now
[00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:41.600]   Excuse me an iPod right now you have to buy like a Sony device that runs Android and it will well the I put
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:47.720]   It's funny cuz the iPod killed physical media and it wasn't long before the iTunes store became the number one place people want music
[00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:53.040]   Not the record store, but now streaming music and Spotify
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:58.560]   You know gets credit for this because Apple came late to the game has really replaced digital copies of music
[00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:04.160]   So Andy you might have wanted a terabyte of music in your pocket, but nowadays with streaming
[00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:11.880]   In a place. Yeah, you know connection. Here's some of Andy's pictures. You did have good seats. What camera were you using?
[00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:14.640]   Oh god, that was like a that was an ancient
[00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:21.360]   Like a spell sonic - oh no that was that was the later of these I was shooting video and pictures some of the best pictures
[00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:29.120]   I got from the video. Oh, yeah, that that was from a really really cheesy a Kodak no Kodak digital camera
[00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:30.320]   I like very much
[00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:36.320]   Wow, here's Steve with with the yeah, I could I could tell this is the Kodak
[00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:45.020]   Wow look at 2006 man like how grainy that is yeah actually I bet with AI - AI tools I could like increase that option
[00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:49.920]   Yeah, yeah, wow, but you know what that I'm looking at the the original pictures
[00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:54.120]   That was a small theater. I don't know where that was
[00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:57.480]   That was the
[00:33:57.480 --> 00:34:04.600]   Where was that I think was the San Jose the arm O'Reilly O'Mac O Conference Center
[00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:10.220]   You say you list on here. Yeah must have been San Jose. Yeah, yeah
[00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:16.720]   Okay, well what a what a great time. There's that black and red
[00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:21.160]   Yeah, beautiful you - iPod
[00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:27.080]   Oh and the iPod socks were announced as well at that event. I
[00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:31.040]   Miss those that was a crazy product
[00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:38.380]   This is this is the only this is the only argument that I will tolerate it the Apple has lost its soul since Apple since Steve Jobs
[00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:45.040]   Passed away like iPod socks. It's such a ridiculous thing, but it was such a lovely thing. It was such an Apple thing
[00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:51.480]   What yeah, I guess I don't it's bizarre. It's just bizarre
[00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:53.960]   Exactly. Yeah
[00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:58.440]   Yeah, I mean and obviously somebody convinced Steve. Yes, Steve. That's what people really want
[00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:05.960]   Socks for their iPod. We need accessories. We need accessories. I remember the Mac world Expo some years later
[00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:13.600]   Was basically the iPod accessory show right yeah, then it became the iPhone accessory show. Yeah, it's fine
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:16.800]   I went for a walk this morning with my Apple watch and my AirPods, you know, that's it
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:21.480]   I didn't have to have anything else that's right the exact same vibe that the I did the iPod used to give me
[00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:27.200]   I was super happy listening to audible just walking down this very portable. Yep. You're streaming it. You don't know is there. Yeah
[00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:35.840]   It is according to Wikipedia the longest run of any Apple product ever 20 years in active production
[00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:39.840]   Hmm, I think the Mac has lasted longer, but I guess any well
[00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:43.840]   Now the Mac has now currently dead product. Maybe that's it
[00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:49.560]   I think we're gonna have to correct Wikipedia now that I think about it. I tation needed
[00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:54.780]   Citation definitely needed Renee Richie Andy and I come glad you could be with with me for the
[00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:56.360]   goodbye
[00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:58.360]   We're here together at the end
[00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:03.320]   Every great story needs an ending that's only when you really understand that's really true
[00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:08.560]   It's not the story hasn't been told until it ends and then the full story comes out
[00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:12.400]   So I think also the also it's a classic case of the past is prelude
[00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:17.440]   This is part of his long ongoing story that began before the iPod and continues after the iPod. Yeah
[00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:21.000]   Our show today brought to you by Blue Land
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:26.480]   I tell you if you want our story and planet Earth to continue one of the first one of the things we got to do is stop
[00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:28.720]   The single-use
[00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:31.320]   Plastics we might also want to stop wasting water too
[00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:35.960]   Blue land has been a revelation for our family an
[00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:44.880]   estimated five billion plastic hand soap and cleaning bottles are thrown away every year and every single plastic bottle ever made is
[00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:49.160]   Still sitting in that landfill. They don't break down
[00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:52.000]   They stay there forever
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:58.800]   And if that's not bad enough all of those plastic bottles of cleaners and hand soap are 90% water
[00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:02.040]   You're you're driving trucks around delivering water
[00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:09.720]   That's a lose lose for the planet and for your pocketbook stop wasting water stop throwing out plastic get Blue Land's
[00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:17.480]   Revolutionary refill cleaning system instead Blue Land was founded on the belief that a cleaner planet starts by eliminating plastic waste
[00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:22.500]   While creating powerful effective cleaners for your entire home forget that notion you might have oh
[00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:26.160]   I can't have a good cleaner from trying to save the planet. That's not true
[00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:29.900]   Blue Land's idea is simple you buy the bottle once this is the
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:36.240]   Forever bottle for the multi surface cleaner. These are lightweight, but hard plastic
[00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:44.600]   But you there's also for the hand soap they are heavier because you have to pump them and so those are nice solid glass. They're great
[00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:53.800]   You buy this once and you refill it forever, which means no more plastic waste the refills are just these little tablets
[00:37:53.800 --> 00:38:00.560]   You fill this with hot water up to the line you put the tablet in it fizzes it dissolves now
[00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:03.840]   You've got excellent cleaners a multi surface cleaner
[00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:06.040]   window cleaner
[00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:08.040]   hand soap all
[00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:15.880]   Smelling great iris agave perein lemon lavender eucalyptus. I bought the Christmas package last Christmas. It was great
[00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:20.120]   Every time I wash my hands smelled like gingerbread or peppermint
[00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:23.000]   It was fantastic
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.200]   These are great beautiful
[00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:27.960]   Instagrammable bottles
[00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:35.320]   And they and they work really well the only thing you'll have to throw out is your outdated idea that eco-friendly products cost more and
[00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:37.440]   Work less
[00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:41.040]   From there and but you can also get it for a kit, which is a great house warming gift
[00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:43.200]   I might add I gave it
[00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:49.680]   I've already given it to my daughter as a house warming gift from their best-selling clean essentials kit to their hand soap duo and
[00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:56.920]   Plastic-free laundry and dishwasher tablets. We use those two in fact. I was putting clothes in the dryer
[00:38:57.560 --> 00:38:59.560]   rare moment for me
[00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:04.520]   At least at least I said could you put the clothes under I said twice so don't forget to put in the blue land wool balls
[00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:09.640]   We got three of those I said to these really help she said yeah cut static dries faster
[00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:12.720]   Don't have to use dryer sheets. Love those
[00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:17.920]   Love those and you know what sells out every time the blue land toilet tablet cleaner
[00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:24.080]   These are so cool because you put them in do the rest of your sinks and stuff come back brush out the toilet
[00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:27.520]   You're done they sell out so fast because they work so well
[00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:34.800]   Blue land stunning high quality forever bottles started just ten dollars when you buy a kit they're meant to be reused forever
[00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:43.480]   The money-saving refill tablets started just two dollars. Yes, you can get a replenishment to subscription. I do so I never run out
[00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:47.500]   Actually, it's interesting. I think because of blue land
[00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:52.640]   Everybody's washing their hands more. I noticed the hand soap runs out
[00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:56.280]   But I don't mind because I've got plenty of tablets just put another one in that's interesting
[00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:59.920]   I'm just thinking around the house. I think because it smells so good try a blue land today

[00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:31.920]   Business Insider
[00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:36.320]   Apple is planning to shake up its massive services business
[00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:39.840]   to push further into streaming and
[00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:46.320]   Advertising eddy q is getting the job of reorganizing the management structure. This is sources
[00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:49.360]   Talking to business insider
[00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:55.600]   Q is giving more responsibility of services vp Peter Stern and adds boss Todd Tiresi
[00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:59.440]   76 billion dollar business
[00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:08.560]   That's the app store that's Apple music. That's iCloud. That's Apple care Apple pay Apple news advertising Apple TV plus a crew 17 percent in the last quarter
[00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:16.600]   As we talked about last week if it were a company by itself it would be the 113th largest company on the fortune 500 list by revenue
[00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:20.400]   Behind several other independent Apple companies. Yeah, right
[00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:24.800]   One person. This is again business insider one person who has spoken directly to Q
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:29.360]   So the senior vice president of services is considering how to unleash growth
[00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:35.240]   By reorganizing the management structure and pushing harder into areas like streaming and advertising
[00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:38.120]   Yeah, growth is the enemy of us all
[00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:43.080]   But but Apple's soul come on wouldn't you rather have them struggling?
[00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:47.680]   But I just I really wish Apple was not an advertising like I love the streaming stuff. I think Peter Stern is
[00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:50.800]   Phenomenal. I think they're doing great great services products
[00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:56.040]   I think add like I know like a lot all of us depend on ads and I have nothing against ads in particular
[00:41:56.040 --> 00:42:02.200]   But I think with the positions that Apple has taken and the way that they've aligned their businesses ads are just not compatible with that
[00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:04.760]   And I fully understand Steve did I ads and he thought you know
[00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:07.400]   There's people with an Apple who believe that they can do ads right?
[00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:10.640]   But it's just it's hard to be the company that you know does ad tracking
[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:13.720]   Transparency and then offers ads like in any way shape or form
[00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:20.080]   It just doesn't pass the Caesar's wife test with me and I wish that wasn't a I know there's so much money that could be made there
[00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:22.440]   I just wish it wasn't a focus area where are the ads right now?
[00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:28.040]   They're in apps the app store and Apple is horrible Apple news is like worse to read than some websites now
[00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:30.640]   Because I know you know you know every second
[00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:37.440]   But also also I wish that Apple were a bit more transparent in where they're selling ads or where they're selling placement more than anything else
[00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:43.160]   Like I'm still kind of horrified that after so many years since the last time that the app store was reorganized
[00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:48.360]   There's still no way to say look don't sort this don't preference this don't give me any editors choice
[00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:54.560]   Don't give me anything just I will I will sit here for I have planned the entire next day and a half to look through every single
[00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:56.760]   Listing in you in the utilities category
[00:42:56.760 --> 00:43:02.080]   Just let me see everything you have without my having to do a search or anything like that and you always feel as though
[00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:09.880]   It's the Netflix effect where are you showing me what you have or are you showing me what you've been hired to promote?
[00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:11.320]   Yeah
[00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:18.120]   So Todd Teresa who's the name you may not remember was in fact the guy in charge of I add
[00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:22.720]   Which launched in 2010 shut in 2016
[00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:29.680]   Because it never really got much of the mobile ad market. So he's getting another shot. He's back in the chair
[00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:34.200]   According to a source who spoke to Apple to a business insider
[00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:42.640]   Services is going to benefit from I think considerably from sports, right?
[00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:45.200]   the
[00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:51.000]   Hollywood rumor is that that the NFL Sunday ticket deal is already done just not announced yet
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:54.400]   They want to buy NBA rights
[00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:59.080]   Which would be interesting they already have Friday night baseball
[00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:06.000]   This is Ed dresser presence of a sports TV consultancy dresser sports media
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:10.400]   The unique situation with Apple is it has a relatively small base for Apple TV plus
[00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:16.360]   The edition of Sunday ticket would allow them to increase their base subscription level of metric in the business known as lift
[00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:21.360]   It's good for your lift it just sign up some cricket. Yeah, exactly
[00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:25.400]   New subscribers additional revenue for add-on sports package
[00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:32.480]   Advertising that's another place advertising can go right you should do a deal with Ryan Reynolds for that that soccer club
[00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:36.800]   He bought with the guy from I'm blanking on his name the guy from mythic quest
[00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:39.120]   Yeah
[00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:46.240]   Yeah, I yeah, you know what I think so I think Apple is the company to make soccer big in America
[00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:52.600]   Again soccer soccer and cricket like these are these are two untapped they
[00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:57.760]   Yeah, exactly. There's you want to make a joke about you know ESPN 8 the ocho
[00:44:57.760 --> 00:45:05.760]   But we could get to get the sports that like have everything that American sports fans would want to say nothing about the people
[00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:10.920]   Who are who came here from countries where soccer and cricket are like the major sports?
[00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:15.040]   That's a huge market that they could be tapping into and I can't imagine that
[00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:22.640]   It says competitive bidding for for international cricket as it's going to be excuse me. Excuse me for you United States rights to
[00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:27.160]   International cricket the fact that you can't even watch it anywhere except for whatever's being posted on YouTube
[00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:32.800]   That's such a big opportunity. It could be a great signature for Apple. That's a really good point
[00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:38.480]   You know, I hope they're listening to us today. Yeah women's women sports
[00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:46.240]   Sports again some of them some some of them greatest amount of time I spend marching sports are like women's collegiate
[00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:49.640]   Softball that I kind of happened into through a Google recommendation
[00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:54.800]   And now it's like my god. This is like they're they're quick. They're not it's college sports
[00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:57.480]   So it's not MLB so there isn't like 80 million ads
[00:45:57.480 --> 00:46:03.280]   But also they get through it really quick the level of play is as high as any other police support good
[00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:06.720]   Yeah, and again, and this is also a category that is
[00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:09.320]   Just not being
[00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:14.800]   For sexism for whatever reason you want to mention they are not being supported with lots of corporate dollars of Apple
[00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:18.360]   Or to say that we got we are gonna we are gonna be the home of WNBA
[00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:22.640]   Wouldn't that be because a because we can snap that up for for not much money
[00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:26.880]   But also because these this is a totally ignored area of sports that needs
[00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:32.480]   That needs a that could that will be boosted by the support of a channel like Apple TV plus anyway
[00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:38.360]   Lots of things that could be doing with sports above the traditional. Hey, we're gonna we're gonna compete with Fox and CBS for
[00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:40.720]   for MLB for
[00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:43.200]   Football and for and for basketball
[00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:51.120]   I think they I think they covered this maybe on the tech news weekly, but Apple Google and Microsoft
[00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:59.040]   Together on May 5th announced that they're gonna expand support of the Fido
[00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:03.240]   Standard F I D O and the Fido Alliance
[00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:12.040]   Which is a passwordless sign-in standard? I think everybody in certainly Microsoft has been saying this for a long time
[00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:14.640]   Yeah, everybody agrees passwords have got to go
[00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:23.880]   Yeah, and the Fido Alliance seems to be the closest thing except for Steve Gibson squirrel, which unfortunately I don't know
[00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:25.880]   Nobody seems to want to adopt
[00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:33.240]   The expanded standards. This is from apples press release expanded standards base capabilities will give websites and apps the ability to offer an
[00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:35.440]   End-to-end passwordless
[00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:37.960]   Option users will sign in
[00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:45.520]   Through the same actually take multiple times each day to unlock their devices. So fingerprint face like a tone basically
[00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:48.200]   So once you're once you're logged into your device
[00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:54.880]   Then you're automatically logged in is that it to the websites or it just automatically says hello the authentication
[00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:58.080]   generates a token we know it's him because or her
[00:47:58.080 --> 00:48:03.000]   Essentially the the entity that wants to be authenticated doesn't do the authentication itself
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:07.760]   That's just simply ask hands the device you're using hey is this person who he claims to be and that's it
[00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:09.760]   This seems right because
[00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:14.320]   Exactly because the fingerprint on my phone is way better than any password that I can remember
[00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:18.960]   And if I want to have something if I want to base my login on something even more secure than that
[00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:25.200]   Saying that here is a physical device that I have to have that will only work with between these two hours in this physical location
[00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:31.920]   I can switch to that too. It is such a long overdue thing and it solves a hard problem that nobody
[00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:36.720]   No that no user likes because you have to have strong passwords
[00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:39.280]   but strong passwords is the are the enemy of
[00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:45.360]   Security because people are going to choose one two three four five six seven eight the eighth time that they have to reset their
[00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:47.120]   password I hope you
[00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:50.720]   Gives in covers is on security now today or at some time
[00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:52.800]   So there I don't want to be a pooper of the parties here
[00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:57.440]   But like they do have to be careful with this like for example Google has a very good authentication
[00:48:58.080 --> 00:49:03.680]   System they have a very bad reauthentication system the difference well first they shouldn't have both but they do
[00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:06.080]   They're both separate things and they have separate feature sets
[00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:10.400]   So for example if I go to log into my gmail account and it doesn't recognize me
[00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:12.080]   It'll say do you want to use authenticator?
[00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:14.240]   Do you want to have an SMS if you have that set up?
[00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:18.320]   Do you want to have another device like you want to get your pixel phone or your iPhone?
[00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:24.400]   And that's all great, but for the re-auth it'll just say you need to find iPhone 5 and I have no idea what iPhone 5 is
[00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:26.720]   I've known where it is might be a different part of the world might be in a drawer
[00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:29.440]   I might have sent it back to apple. Do you want to use a different method?
[00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:31.440]   Sorry, you can't well
[00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:36.400]   Like so it's like so it's like so it's obvious and maybe that's maybe I hope Google will go to this
[00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:44.720]   According to the apple press release one of the things phyto does is allow users to automatically access their credentials
[00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:51.680]   Sometimes you use the word passkey on many devices even new ones without having to reenroll every account
[00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:57.600]   So you can I guess apple or google or microsoft would act as a trusted third party
[00:49:57.600 --> 00:50:00.320]   You could say hey microsoft new device
[00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:03.840]   Please authenticate this one and then the authentication goes forwards
[00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:07.840]   It also enables enables users to use phyto authentication on their mobile device
[00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:11.520]   To sign into an app or website on a nearby device
[00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:15.040]   Regardless of independent of it os or browser
[00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:19.680]   So I have my iPhone this is now becoming and I think this is this makes a lot of sense
[00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:25.520]   This is my authenticator and I have my iPhone and I put it near my pc my windows pc
[00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:31.680]   And the pc says I see it's uleo because you've authenticated using face id that's a new that is a
[00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:37.440]   I would love to see that you for like a bank the banks are doing that are either challenging you does that then to get on the device app
[00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:43.120]   Yeah, it does it does also illustrate another possible thing that we need to watch out for that
[00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:45.680]   if government services do
[00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:51.120]   Our thing that is on the surface quite responsible and saying that hey look we're not going to allow people to access your accounts
[00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:55.840]   Access your information unless we're going to demand this higher level of authentication this higher level of security
[00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:59.360]   Which is good for most people but now you can't have a system in which
[00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:04.160]   Uh like the state government for for government benefits for your snap benefits
[00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:10.000]   They can't say oh well we won't authenticate you unless you have a smartphone with these capabilities because a lot of the people
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:13.280]   That's right services don't have these things. Yeah, there has to be a fallback
[00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:16.320]   It has to accommodate people who are not going to have the technology
[00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:20.560]   I also be concerned that it's somewhat less secure because it's single factor. It's just
[00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:22.560]   Biometrics
[00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:26.800]   So I I would hope there would be a way to say no and I want a second factor
[00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:31.360]   In addition to the biometric like one and a half because you you have to have the object as well
[00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:34.640]   So you have to be like the thing that you are your fingerprint and object that will
[00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:38.160]   So it is still two factors that you're right. Yeah, you're right. Yeah, you're right. One and a half
[00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:40.160]   I'm not gonna go all the way to do it. Yeah
[00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:43.120]   Yeah, well, I can understand that these companies would like to
[00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:45.920]   Make it easier
[00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:52.560]   They understand the current system is horribly insecure because most users reuse passwords. They don't have good passwords
[00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:57.840]   I mean, it's already so bad always if the anything better is going to be more secure
[00:51:57.840 --> 00:52:04.240]   But it is it as secure as people like us who know what we're doing who use two factors use
[00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:10.560]   A eubiqui for instance and touch id and so can we make it as secure as we want it to be?
[00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:15.120]   Yes, it's better for most people. But is it another factor if he's gonna be dumbing it down
[00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:18.720]   Yeah, my my understanding of the standard is that it's it's agnostic
[00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:23.840]   So that whatever so that if I decide that no, no, I want to have the secure
[00:52:23.840 --> 00:52:28.400]   Key plugged into a USB C port plus this other form of authentication
[00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:31.680]   Because so long as that so long as that step has been achieved
[00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:32.960]   the
[00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:34.720]   Side of the other end doesn't care how it's been achieved
[00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:38.960]   So if I and if I do want to have a password like one two three four five six seven eight and no
[00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:42.080]   Authority is preventing from doing that I could also do that
[00:52:42.080 --> 00:52:48.400]   But as soon as as soon as people say oh look people who have a phone made in the past five six or seven years
[00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:50.720]   As soon as they say well just put touch your
[00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:54.960]   fingerprint authenticate on this device and now you're you're good for pretty much everywhere you go
[00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:57.280]   How do you solve this for people who don't have a phone?
[00:52:57.280 --> 00:53:00.480]   As you as you pointed out, Andy, this is problematic
[00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:05.440]   I think I think you have to I think you have to stick to like old-fashioned like really really strong passwords
[00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:08.480]   It's it's a I don't know what this what the solution would be
[00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:10.320]   a non
[00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:12.800]   This is this is a solution that if you have technology
[00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:16.960]   Your golden if you don't have technology you kind of have to stick with the old stuff
[00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:22.080]   But you have to make sure that there is always that other door just just like every other every time there is a
[00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:30.160]   Big initiative to saying hey from now on all your government benefits can be paid electronically into uh into uh into a bank account
[00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:34.720]   Early we're gonna have a portal website so that you don't have to go to eight different sites to manage
[00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:38.160]   This is one desktop for everything you always have to have that 800 number
[00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:43.200]   You always have to have that phone line for people who just have access to a telephone and are lucky to have that
[00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:49.040]   You have to account for people who don't have a fixed address that or don't even have access to banking
[00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:53.280]   That there it's because it's these one two three percent sometimes 10 percent
[00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:58.960]   Of the population that need the services the most and are going to be suffering the most if they get shut up
[00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:06.000]   I expect to hear something from google tomorrow. We're going to be covering google. I owe keynote 10 am pacific 1 pm eastern
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:08.800]   Jeff Jarvis jason howl and I will be
[00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:14.240]   Watching the keynote so I expect google is part of this alliance. I expect to hear them say something
[00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:20.000]   I'm sure apple will as they did by the way last year ww dc. I'm sure they will go further into this
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:26.160]   Is amazing like every every week or so you see a twee go by with someone who just figured out that they could do automatic
[00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:28.000]   SMS
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:32.720]   Code filling and there's like give a raise to ever invented this and I look over at the guys account to invent it
[00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:36.400]   That is a nice feature. Isn't that a nice feature? I just love that. Yeah
[00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:44.240]   Um, and I hope that companies don't see this as a way to lock people into their devices or their phones or you know
[00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:50.880]   This really needs to be an industry-wide kind of initiative everybody about facebook so far, right?
[00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:54.480]   Yeah, yeah, right facebook and twitter. Where the hell are you?
[00:54:56.080 --> 00:54:59.120]   Make money every time so there's lots of good problems right now. Yeah, you'll have
[00:54:59.120 --> 00:55:04.800]   Musk a little the market is the market is fixing the market is fixing that right now
[00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:11.360]   Yeah, why is it with Tesla stock or twitter stock the stock is so far down. I don't know if i'll have enough money to buy twitter anymore
[00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:14.720]   Oh, yeah, yeah
[00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:16.720]   Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[00:55:16.720 --> 00:55:18.880]   We almost had a must free straighten
[00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:23.440]   The 2020s create and solve their own problems. It's yes. Yeah
[00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:26.400]   Yeah all in one massive stroke
[00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:28.000]   uh
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:31.280]   Do you think wwdc will be the uh?
[00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:34.240]   unveil of apples ar
[00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:40.080]   You know, I don't I would love it too, but I I think it's too early. Yeah. Yeah, I think we'll see the mac pro
[00:55:40.080 --> 00:55:45.200]   I just don't think we'll see the I think it's I think that's the only thing that I'd be building to bet for sure is that this
[00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:51.040]   Year there will be outside parties who have been seated with hardware and dev kits so that they can a
[00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:54.400]   dog food test their own
[00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:58.320]   Their own system outside the outside of the the company but also so that
[00:55:58.320 --> 00:56:04.320]   At the time when they first show this this thing they can't just show and here is a box
[00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:07.360]   And now here is a clown sitting on top of the but they have to show
[00:56:07.360 --> 00:56:13.440]   Something real something that is even gonna want developers to invest two or three thousand dollars in advanced hardware
[00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:17.840]   So that they can hopefully chase after the money that comes a year after the developer hardware comes out
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:23.920]   Art so that's the only thing that's the only thing I believe for sure article in protocol yanko records writing apple is a massive
[00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:31.360]   Force and ar it's also been holding the technology back. That's not what yanko's saying. That's what some are saying in ar
[00:56:31.360 --> 00:56:39.440]   Uh including immersive computing suspect a specialist christopher lepcrowski who says apple's been a drag on innovation and web ar
[00:56:39.440 --> 00:56:41.360]   primarily because
[00:56:41.360 --> 00:56:44.080]   They haven't put in the i've they haven't put it in the iphone
[00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:46.800]   um web based ar
[00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:49.040]   Support is still lacking
[00:56:49.040 --> 00:56:52.880]   Um yanko says where we need alex the company. I know
[00:56:52.880 --> 00:56:57.920]   Yeah, but he also is so bullish on it that sometimes it's like well, okay, okay
[00:56:57.920 --> 00:57:01.360]   A thousand engineers working on ar glasses at apple
[00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:06.320]   Um plans to release something according to uh everyone included mark
[00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:09.520]   A huge office in boulder colorado now this year or bolder interesting
[00:57:09.520 --> 00:57:15.920]   Uh they have that framework. They have usdz alex is always singing its praises his favorite yep
[00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:18.960]   um
[00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:23.360]   But it's interesting like if they if they were going to release the headset like actually release it in september
[00:57:23.360 --> 00:57:26.080]   I would expect developer announcement in june
[00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:32.640]   But if they're if they're if it's not going to come out until spring 2023 that I don't think we'll get the developer announcement until
[00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:36.000]   Like september or october the way they did with the apple watch
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:38.240]   lupress
[00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:40.240]   koski's complaint is
[00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:43.920]   That you that ar works on the iphone, but you have to download an app for it
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:49.520]   You have to get the ikea app or the something app he says every click you make consumers go through you lose 50
[00:57:49.520 --> 00:57:52.720]   Percent of your audience. He wants it. He wants web xr
[00:57:52.720 --> 00:57:58.080]   He wants that standard which is was developed by google meta sam san mozilla and magic leap
[00:57:58.080 --> 00:58:01.120]   But is yet to be supported on iphone
[00:58:01.120 --> 00:58:06.640]   Yeah, they supported they just don't support the same framework that everyone else is using which makes it effective
[00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:10.800]   Like you can go to apple.com press a button the utz file opens up and you can yeah, yeah
[00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:13.840]   That's right. They do that all the time with their invitations, right? Yeah
[00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:18.000]   And google is google is doing as you say
[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:24.400]   Ar through the web or at least excuse me three d through the web where now so many search results will result in hey
[00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:29.280]   Do you want to see if you do for your book report on the on the on the mountain lion?
[00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:32.720]   Hey, do you want to see is not only do you want to hear what a lot mountain lion sounds like?
[00:58:32.720 --> 00:58:36.960]   We'd like a mountain lion on your desktop that you could then play with and and turn around 360 degrees
[00:58:37.360 --> 00:58:41.440]   I think I think it is a sign that even apple and google are kind of struggling to sell
[00:58:41.440 --> 00:58:48.000]   For the moment the public on what ar is going to do for them until until they give them the whole burrito
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:52.800]   Where hey, you're here's something that you would want to wear on your face for hours at a time
[00:58:52.800 --> 00:58:59.040]   That will not block you out from reality will simply enhance reality the same way that airbuds will enhance your reality by
[00:58:59.040 --> 00:59:06.000]   Replacing all the street fights that you're hearing outside your door with uh with great music and audiobooks until they find that moment
[00:59:06.240 --> 00:59:10.000]   It's going to be hard to even sell like these 500 dollar headsets that uh oculus is having
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:14.320]   There's also there's also this thing where apple is philosophically right but pragmatically wrong
[00:59:14.320 --> 00:59:19.760]   And what I mean by that is there was this big discussion at apple when the iphone was coming out what what it should run like app kit
[00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:25.440]   Or web kit or something new and don melton who ran web kit at the times that it shouldn't be web kit
[00:59:25.440 --> 00:59:27.760]   Because it's like as much as i'm the web guy
[00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:31.760]   Native performance is always going to be better web performance is always going to improve
[00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:35.920]   But you'll always be able to do more with native and you have a native platform
[00:59:36.240 --> 00:59:38.400]   And that has continued over the years like the palm
[00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:41.440]   You know it took 20 seconds to open the palm calendar app back in the day
[00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:44.800]   And it just wasn't acceptable to apple at the time and even now
[00:59:44.800 --> 00:59:50.800]   Web apps can do phenomenal things but native is still faster and apple has two massive native platforms
[00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:56.000]   So from their point of view just running all this stuff natively, especially with a headset about to come out
[00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:57.520]   Makes so much sense
[00:59:57.520 --> 01:00:02.880]   But so few other companies have native platforms that for them the web is a pragmatic solution
[01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:08.560]   It really is code once run everywhere. It's the java. It's the air. It's the it's the electron app
[01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:12.560]   And apple just they can't get over that and the web kit team is doing way better
[01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:17.760]   They've they've announced all its experimental stuff. They're going to start supporting way more technologies and in those streams
[01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:19.680]   And i'm sure they're going to add this to the list
[01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:21.760]   I'm not sure but you know, hopefully they'll add this to the list
[01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:25.600]   But it is that divide between we have this hugely successful native platform
[01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:30.000]   Why are you all screwing around with the web and they're like because we don't we don't have your platform, sir
[01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:36.240]   ma'am, right this will be something to watch deb at wwdc apparently there is some web xr code and web kit
[01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:42.640]   um apple apparent, you know is a member of the you know w3c consortium the immersive web group
[01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:46.560]   uh, so they you know they participate but
[01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:49.280]   according to yankos article
[01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:50.720]   um
[01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:55.760]   apple promoted this new html element to display 3d content and browsers they pushed it
[01:00:55.920 --> 01:01:01.360]   But it's just a narrow part of the spec and people are saying well, why not just implement the whole spec?
[01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:03.040]   Why is apple
[01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:06.160]   Locking it out of the iphone so this would be something to watch
[01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:11.360]   Next month, uh, what apple says about sometimes it's security like they were slow with web gl
[01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:15.520]   But their implementation was the most secure of all the implementations and everybody else caught up
[01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:18.480]   Like they just weren't first but they were best and then everyone else became just as good
[01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:22.400]   Uh, the article concludes whether by choice or under pressure if apple does
[01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:24.960]   Change its heart on supporting web xr
[01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:32.560]   Industry insiders predict a massive shift for the entire industry with a new wave of innovation even before consumer grade
[01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:37.200]   AR glasses or market ready and maybe that's why apple's dragging its feet
[01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:45.120]   Maybe it it doesn't want to undermine its own statement. Yeah, it would be a new dawn for ar you'd see a lot of investment going in this area
[01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:47.600]   uh, so
[01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:49.600]   watch yeah, I
[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:53.440]   It's either apple says no, we're gonna do something proprietary
[01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:55.600]   Bad
[01:01:55.600 --> 01:02:01.360]   But you know, that's kind of apple's position with progressive web apps as well. They just really don't want those on the apple
[01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:05.360]   Uh platform. They don't want them in web kit or they're holding on
[01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:08.720]   Until they have something really secure. Okay
[01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:12.320]   And just right for maybe a some hardware
[01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:18.720]   But uh, this would be more self-serving like they might wait until they've announced and because native is the only option
[01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:24.240]   Everything will look so silky smooth and fantastic. Nobody will be able to load up a web page to show them a web page
[01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:28.720]   Oh sure you can have it now. Yeah, you can have it now. Yeah, and then and then the next year
[01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:32.640]   They'll announce the web stuff when everyone's already gaga over how well the heck, you know
[01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:37.600]   That it's you know, it's a I mean that was the the home pod the original home pod didn't have bluetooth
[01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:42.320]   And my understanding is because they thought that a bunch of us lazy reviewers wouldn't even try airplay
[01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:47.680]   We would just load up bluetooth and it would sound exactly the same as everybody else's speakers and would not justify the price tag
[01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:52.320]   And so he left it off and forced us to use airplane and say oh, it sounds really good. I kind of understand that actually
[01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:54.320]   I try to use airplane whenever possible
[01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:57.760]   It does sound better right because it's got more bandwidth and bluetooth
[01:02:57.760 --> 01:03:00.720]   All right, let's take a little break when we come back
[01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:04.640]   Will apple employees come back to work
[01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:13.280]   There is a a bit of a um revolt going on before we do that though. I want to talk about
[01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:16.320]   uh earbuds
[01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:21.840]   Everybody says when you get earbuds very important if you want good bass response to get a good fit
[01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:27.200]   But they give you five tips and you're trying the tips and you're putting them in and then they fall out when you shake your head
[01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:29.520]   And you don't know do I have the best seal
[01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:33.360]   I was so excited when ultimate ears, which makes the best
[01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:40.240]   Inear headphones in ear monitors used by musicians all over the world announced ultimate ear fits and that's what i've got in my hand
[01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:42.560]   right now
[01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:44.000]   These are
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000]   true wireless
[01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:51.040]   Headphones that are custom fitted to your ear
[01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:56.480]   But you don't have to go to an audiologist audiologist to do this when I when I got my in ear monitors
[01:03:56.480 --> 01:04:02.000]   I went to an audiologist. He fills up your ear with silicone with a little string on it. You sit you have to have
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:07.760]   Popsicle sticks in your mouth keep your mouth open while it sets five minutes later
[01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:10.320]   He pulls it out with a giant suction sound
[01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:17.600]   And now they have a mold which you then send to to a company to make in ear monitors with
[01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:22.320]   But you know that's what you choose bono does. That's what all the musicians do
[01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:26.400]   They have custom fit and I tell you with custom fit. Not only are they
[01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:32.400]   Comfort more comfortable. No one else can wear them and the sound is great because they seal your ear
[01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:38.480]   I thought that was impossible without an audiologist's involvement. This is an amazing technology
[01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:44.960]   That you get a guaranteed fit in 60 seconds here. I've got the ultimate ears when you first get the box
[01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:48.960]   They're sealed away from oxygen. You put the ue fits
[01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:51.840]   app on your phone unseal them
[01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:56.240]   So that you know air can hit them you're going to put them in your ear
[01:04:56.240 --> 01:05:00.960]   And they use this groundbreaking light form technology to mold
[01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:03.680]   So the unique contours of your ear
[01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:07.920]   And it does it in about a minute watch i'm going to do it. So don't
[01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:10.400]   Now it's i'm going to put them in my ear
[01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:15.520]   It turns the light turns blue it warms up you can feel it warming up
[01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:19.760]   And by the way, I from long experience did keep my mouth half open
[01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:22.400]   Because apparently that changes the fit
[01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:24.560]   Now
[01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:26.720]   Yeah, once you got them it fits

[01:05:54.000 --> 01:06:00.080]   It's exactly how I want it to sound but you can also use the app to set custom eq presets
[01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:04.240]   in fact, uh, you know for my older ears. I actually
[01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:09.040]   Modeled it a little bit better to fit my hearing they let you do that too

[01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:53.040]   Um, I can get you a sketch up here because I'd love for you to try these k woods in our at chat room says he saw the ad
[01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:55.920]   Uh a couple of weeks ago ordered him he says yep
[01:07:56.800 --> 01:07:59.360]   Got him in less than a week most comfortable headphones ever
[01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:03.360]   So nice really good berg get a pair for Andy will you
[01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:10.880]   Berg doesn't he has nothing so it's fine sure well, yeah, right? Okay. Yeah. Yeah, yes my how
[01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:20.880]   So, uh, we have we talked about this last week a lot of apples returned to work phase in has begun
[01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:29.360]   Uh, I think in a week or two you're gonna have to as an apple employee spend at least three days on the apple campus or an apple office
[01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:32.560]   Um up from two up from one up from none
[01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:40.080]   lots of people really, uh like the work from home thing and all I think a considerable number of
[01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:42.880]   um
[01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:46.720]   Apple employees have signed a petition somebody said as many as half
[01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:50.800]   Saying you you're not listening. We don't want to come back
[01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:54.080]   I know Steve thought it'd be great. We could all talk out to each other
[01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:59.200]   Except that by the way at apple you can't because no one's allowed to talk to anybody else about what they're working on
[01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:05.360]   Uh to be clear. These are the people who work with bits the people who've worked with atoms have been back for like a year and a half already
[01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:09.920]   The hardware folks. Yeah, this includes retail as well, right?
[01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:12.000]   But I think you couldn't really work for mom
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:13.520]   Open and close
[01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:16.160]   Apple was really good at actually opening and closing and staging things up
[01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:19.680]   But you had to have the retail so these are these are programmers essentially coders
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:24.720]   Designers that kind of thing marketing marketing PR services
[01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:31.120]   Uh already a high profile departure Ian good fellow who's apple's director of machine learning
[01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:34.560]   Sent in a note to his staff according to zoe shiffer
[01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:39.840]   Said quote I believe strongly that more flexibility would have been the best policy for my team
[01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:44.560]   Um, not exactly the same thing as saying i'm quitting because of it, but he's
[01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:48.240]   He's also been there exactly the right amount of time
[01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:53.200]   It wasn't the only thing on his list. I think it was the highest thing on his list. Yeah. Yeah, that's it
[01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:59.680]   That's a good point Leo like I wonder I wonder if he felt that he would if he would have felt that way as a regular like salaried employee
[01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:02.240]   that you know if I
[01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:03.680]   Who who doesn't have like gee?
[01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:04.080]   I
[01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:06.480]   This is this is around the time where I could start to think about hey
[01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:12.960]   I can take all the money that all the stock money that I was being given to be wooed away from google and now I can take it and go someplace else
[01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:16.080]   Yeah, exactly, but there's also but there's also
[01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:20.000]   I don't know if this is the situation at apple, but I've been hearing about
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:24.240]   companies that large companies in the bay area that have like
[01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:29.840]   Part of the tax breaks they got when they bought property where they built like in that area
[01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:34.080]   Was contingent upon them having a certain number of employees on that campus
[01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:41.680]   And that for those few companies that they will actually lose those tax benefits if they were to go to exactly the sort of work from work from home
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:46.880]   Split job that that employees really want so possibly part of this could be out of apple
[01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:51.440]   Tans where it would just cause them too much money to let most other people go from work from home
[01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:54.720]   That's interesting. I there it has always been the thesis
[01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:57.200]   the theory as to why
[01:10:57.200 --> 01:11:02.960]   Companies want their employees come back to work because they have leased and rented and bought huge amounts of
[01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:06.640]   office space and damn it we're gonna fill it
[01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:09.200]   You know our offices have been
[01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:15.680]   Mostly empty for two years. We invited people to come back a lot of people felt like they really didn't want to we weren't you know
[01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:22.160]   Adam and about it a lot of our employees can work from home, you know, obviously some people can't studio engineers can't
[01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:24.000]   um
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.240]   And then you know this new ba
[01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:30.960]   Well first it was ba2 now. It's ba. What is it two 12 22 or something?
[01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:36.240]   Yeah, there's a new one the 20 percent 25 percent spike or 33 percent spike on the 25 percent spike and
[01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:43.040]   Enough of these already. We've already had for the first time ever because I was really proud for we went two years. Nobody
[01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:47.840]   uh none of our employees got it and now people are getting it and
[01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:51.680]   Yeah, we're sending people home. We got to wear a mask in the studio again
[01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:57.200]   So there is you know, there's a couple of reasons you might know i'm coming I could work one for you know purely
[01:11:57.200 --> 01:12:02.400]   You know for health reasons, but I think we've also learned that we can get the job done maybe even better
[01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:07.040]   Yeah at home if i'm a coder. I would rather work at home on my system
[01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:11.360]   Without having employees because i peek over the partition saying what you're working on
[01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:17.760]   And without me like record years, but they also had so many people pull purchases forward because they needed new devices
[01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:20.880]   They needed new things during work from home for themselves
[01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:26.000]   So people who said that apple was way more successful during the shutdown and lockdown and work from home
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:30.400]   That's a huge distortion. You have to remove like everybody who suddenly needed a mac or needed an ipad
[01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:38.000]   We wanted to upgrade early from that list and I think it's inarguable that the the like the ios and mac o s
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:41.360]   We're not feature complete over the last two years
[01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:47.040]   And a lot of that is also a distortion because people were dealing with so much like they were they were not used to working from home
[01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:51.760]   They had no child care. Maybe at first they had the pressure of like six family members all of those things
[01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:55.920]   So I would throw out the negatives and throw out the positives and say like we really don't know
[01:12:56.240 --> 01:13:00.560]   What it would be like for a company like apple, but you do have these I did a whole video on this
[01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:01.440]   I'm not going to go over the whole thing
[01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:03.360]   But I put up a long video on this this morning
[01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:08.800]   But you have like the apple boomers who really believe in this culture that you have to be there that it works together
[01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:11.760]   That's they're going to inculturate you by dealing with everybody else on the team
[01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:18.480]   And then you have like the apple zoomers who just think that they are relics and fossils and have no idea how like modern things should work
[01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:24.080]   And it's it's a really big culture clash and unfortunately it doesn't seem like apple is paying as much attention to
[01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:26.720]   Managing it as they are managing the supply chain
[01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:31.120]   They're like legit 9,000 IQ geniuses at getting products out during the pandemic
[01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:35.520]   But all of this stuff keeps bubbling up over and over again and it doesn't seem like they have a handle on it
[01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:39.440]   So what is so one of the things we were talking about we had Alex cantorwits
[01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:46.000]   And briano woo on on sunday on twit great show and one of the things Alex thought was a little weird was
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.160]   uh
[01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:49.360]   apple's famous
[01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:54.000]   Secrecy prevents employees from talking across departments to other employees
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:14:01.440]   So some of the benefits that apple's talking about other companies talk about of this kind of mixing of ideas isn't going to happen in apple
[01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:04.560]   Anyway, oh no, it's it's engineered that way like in apple park
[01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:08.560]   Like they have those rings but you are locked into your like vertical slice of that ring
[01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:11.280]   And it's adjacent teams that are that are locked together
[01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:15.200]   So like you got to go out of your way to see anybody who's not already disclosed on what you're working on
[01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:18.080]   Is it unfortunately does not solve for that problem sieve jobs
[01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:19.280]   uh
[01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:24.080]   Reportedly when that apple ring was going to be built said we only want one bathroom per floor
[01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:27.120]   So everybody who can talk to each other is that apocryphal
[01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:29.920]   I believe so
[01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:31.920]   Just like
[01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:33.920]   Around
[01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:39.120]   Uh, no, but like like you like you go or you don't go around at apple park you go up and down like that's my understanding
[01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:43.520]   Oh interesting so you can't go around the ring you can only i mean depends on your card
[01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:46.480]   I'm guessing but like you'll hit those invisible doors. It's um wow
[01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:50.800]   I'd love to go in there once though. Of course I will never
[01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:56.400]   But uh, I would love to just see it be very cool. I saw it on the early years. Did you
[01:14:56.400 --> 01:15:00.800]   Yeah, it like when it was first opening it took some of us in for for different stuff
[01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:02.480]   Oh, you got to go inside beautiful
[01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:08.160]   It was way like it was like night and day to compare to infinite loop because infinite loop already had like a huge overcrowding problem
[01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:13.040]   By then and this was just very early like I don't think the whole the whole company certainly hadn't moved in yet
[01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:16.560]   So it was very sterile and serene and fresh and clean
[01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:21.360]   Well, yes, all the offices are until if the humans arrive till the humans arrive
[01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:29.120]   Um somebody till till the until the apple gangs each the individual apple gangs claims their turf. Yeah. Yeah
[01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:35.680]   Um, somebody said that there's a drone footage of apple of people returning
[01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:41.600]   Is that true? It's me the chat room said that there was so much on twitter about people having to commute again
[01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:43.600]   And I think like a lot of us who aren't in the bay area
[01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:49.600]   Don't understand like how long it takes to go even just a few miles in rush hour and that that's real lost time
[01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:54.320]   That's lost time. That's bad for the like it's bad for nature because they're burning all these fossil fuels
[01:15:54.320 --> 01:16:00.240]   And it's it's a huge cut into their day and a lot of them have a lot of people in in that area have like
[01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:03.440]   They don't need money anymore. They're they're there because they want to dent universes
[01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:07.120]   And they were working from beaches and ski slopes for the last two years
[01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:13.520]   Or they're seeing their kids and their pets a lot more often than they used to or they or they could take exactly an hour
[01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:17.680]   And a half off for dental employment is seven to take an entire personal day off for dental appointment
[01:16:17.680 --> 01:16:23.280]   Here's this this is this is this is the this is the flip of labor already in last 2022 that people asking gee
[01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:25.280]   Why are we doing these procedures?
[01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:28.720]   And the wrong answer is because we've already done always done it this way
[01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:32.880]   Give us a reason why I can't work from from home two or three days out of the week
[01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:34.160]   here's a
[01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:38.160]   one drone shot of uh people in the meal area
[01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:42.960]   I see all the picnic tables and line aligned to get into the cafeteria
[01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:47.120]   So um by May 23rd
[01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:49.920]   You'll have to spend three days a week
[01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:54.800]   Uh waiting in line for lunch instead of all tim asked johnnie for was a corner office
[01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:58.720]   All he said is we're making a new headquarters. Just give me a corner corner leave me showed up
[01:16:58.720 --> 01:17:04.240]   That's a real falling out right there does trip meckle cover that in the book. I wonder no
[01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:09.040]   But google. I doesn't have any corners and it's an art museum. You think are you better than the
[01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:18.640]   Fast company story how apple overcame its culture of secrecy to create air pods pro
[01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:23.280]   Uh a former hr business partner
[01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:29.040]   Uh chris deaver wrote this he joined apple in 2015
[01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:36.400]   Uh he actually talks about the the the dark sides of secrecy hoarding of critical information
[01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:39.280]   pushing personal agendas in fighting
[01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:45.200]   As a new hr business partner. I was often pulled into these escalations and was usually
[01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:48.560]   Winging about the team is not sharing
[01:17:48.560 --> 01:17:52.800]   Dad
[01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:58.320]   I remember like when news when the apple news was announced at the same time they announced a news aggregation feature in safari
[01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:03.520]   And they didn't work together and everyone's like why why not do that is because the two people had no idea what they were working on
[01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:05.520]   They were both black operations
[01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:09.440]   That's what secrecy was getting in the way dree deaver writes and what we'd seen
[01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:13.840]   With the development of the air puzzles an example of what exactly would happen when we hadn't solved for it
[01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:20.480]   Teams were innovating for months in silos only to finally converge in the 11th hour before lunch launch
[01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:27.120]   Or lunch ending up in five or six hour long daily meetings creating tremendous friction and burnout
[01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:33.200]   People were frustrated they wanted to leave or quote never work with that one person again
[01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:38.000]   Customers don't know these behind the scenes struggles of giving birth to the air pods
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:43.360]   Just like most engineers to develop the air pods didn't know the air pods would be such an explosively successful
[01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:45.760]   Meme worthy project product
[01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:50.400]   Would you remember the home pod where like the home pod was announced and it was delayed and it was supposed to run airplay
[01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:53.600]   But it turned out airplay was like a weekend project and was never meant to scale like this
[01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:58.400]   Oh, it's get to go and rewrite airplay and then they had to realize that oh core audio has so much technical debt
[01:18:58.400 --> 01:19:03.440]   We got to fix you know 20 10 years of Mac problems now as well just to get this to work
[01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:04.720]   Yeah
[01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:09.920]   That's very sad this very sad to hear because one of the hallmarks of apple as a as a business is
[01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:12.320]   For me has been how
[01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:18.480]   Little infighting that they've had compared to most other companies that I know about and compared to the apple of old
[01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:25.840]   I mean the uh 1997 apple there were people who are actively trying to undermine each other's to get access to their resources and their
[01:19:25.840 --> 01:19:28.320]   And their human power
[01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:32.720]   And it seemed as though apple had kind of beat that but the secrecy of not being not
[01:19:32.720 --> 01:19:35.360]   Left-hand not knowing what the right hand is doing. That's why
[01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:39.520]   Bad products happen. That's why you wind up with extremely brilliant
[01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:44.400]   Industrial design and technological features that the operating system is not really support
[01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:47.680]   Is not really has not really been built in order to take advantage of
[01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:51.360]   He says that they were inspired by ed catmull
[01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:57.600]   His book creative creativity incorporated and the notion of of the brain trust at pixar
[01:19:57.600 --> 01:20:01.280]   A collective team committed to egos off the table building blocks
[01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:06.000]   On the table this inspiration led to a brain trust
[01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.800]   For the development of air pods
[01:20:08.800 --> 01:20:11.680]   deeper collaboration
[01:20:11.680 --> 01:20:17.600]   A culture shift apple does that but at the executive level like they they are very good at having their weekly monday meetings
[01:20:17.840 --> 01:20:21.520]   And then having their feature meetings where the svp's get together and they figure everything out
[01:20:21.520 --> 01:20:24.160]   But then it's it's given off to the individual teams and
[01:20:24.160 --> 01:20:39.680]   About this 10 years ago. Yeah, like why doesn't find my work with serious? Well, you s
[01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:45.760]   Read people in individually remember in the early iphone days like and when steve wasn't there they couldn't read people in and they had to go
[01:20:45.760 --> 01:20:50.400]   Back and forth from the whiteboard to this unsecure room to tell them what they had just drawn on the whiteboard
[01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:55.360]   Also, there's there people make fun of management as being you know, michael scott's
[01:20:55.360 --> 01:21:01.120]   But the thing is brilliant management is all about traffic management of being the person who's aware of these people are about
[01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:07.040]   Are about to infringe into each other's lanes. They should be driving together or they should be aware of what's what's going on between each other
[01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:11.120]   So there's no it's it's one it's one of the worst ways to step on a rake possible
[01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:14.000]   And it's one of the hardest problems to solve I think in in management
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.480]   So
[01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:20.080]   They apparently tried this brain trust when developing the camera
[01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:26.080]   For the ipone phone and then uh try to apply the same approach to the next iteration of airpods
[01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:29.600]   regular cross-staff sessions transparency
[01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:35.920]   And shared voice what happened next was amazing again. This is diva writing as teams converge with leaders
[01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:39.600]   Becoming more open connected and driving higher quality collaboration
[01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:42.560]   Then ever before we spent time coaching collaborating
[01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:48.560]   And influencing key leaders and engineers driving the next frontier of airpods what emerged as a brain trust
[01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:51.680]   with regular sessions openness and connection
[01:21:51.680 --> 01:21:57.200]   Uh, and he says that was what brought to life the insanely great noise canceling airpods
[01:21:57.200 --> 01:22:01.840]   Pro so this is really an article and fast company for other I think intended for other business leaders
[01:22:01.840 --> 01:22:03.360]   Um
[01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:06.080]   Saying, you know, there's there's possible to do this better
[01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:08.240]   This is uh, chris diva
[01:22:08.240 --> 01:22:14.160]   Writing former HR. That's not even necessarily dysfunction side apple people again
[01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:18.480]   We we are so attached to the personalities that we know about in the history and the culture
[01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:21.680]   We forget that it is as I keep saying a two trillion dollar company
[01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:25.520]   And that means that there's there's so big that there are some things that they are not going to be
[01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:29.760]   Very good at in terms of management in terms of workflow in terms of all these other things that
[01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:34.000]   They have the same problems everybody else. It's not because the it's not because the company's falling apart
[01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:36.240]   It's because it's a huge freaking company
[01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:42.400]   The shanhead really weird company because they like apple uniquely amongst the giant tech companies
[01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:47.920]   Almost died like they were close to bankruptcy and a lot of the executives there still think that they're beatable
[01:22:47.920 --> 01:22:53.840]   Like they know what it's like to lose and so they uh, some of those departments have historically been so incredibly stingy
[01:22:53.840 --> 01:22:58.080]   That is like one person or one engineer who's in charge of an entirely important feature
[01:22:58.080 --> 01:23:03.520]   For a device like like famously ken kishinda made the iphone keyboard at microsoft. That would be 200 people
[01:23:03.840 --> 01:23:08.480]   Working on the keyboard for a mobile device and it creates like I think in some companies
[01:23:08.480 --> 01:23:10.720]   There's way too many cooks in the kitchen, but at apple
[01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:16.160]   There's historically been way too few and that creates whole different set of problematic, you know, the challenges
[01:23:16.160 --> 01:23:21.200]   The company the corrupt during the during the depression and has to use every yes nine times, you know
[01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:27.200]   Shanghai's covid lockdown and it's sixth week is absolutely affecting
[01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:33.200]   Apple and it is not getting any easier. This article in wall street journal for a couple of days ago
[01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:38.960]   Uh, the covid lockdown gets tougher if one person tests positive the whole building isolates
[01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:46.000]   Um quanta, which is where apple makes its laptops is one of the companies shut down
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:47.760]   um
[01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:50.080]   tighter restrictions since the beginning of april
[01:23:50.080 --> 01:23:55.760]   And uh, there's a video that was shared on twitter and youtube of workers
[01:23:55.760 --> 01:23:58.400]   rushing through the barriers
[01:23:58.400 --> 01:24:00.640]   Trying to trying to get out
[01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:03.200]   Uh, this is from a may sixth
[01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:07.360]   um trying to escape the lockdown and uh
[01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:13.200]   There's a lot of suffering going on. It's it's bad news. It's really uh, it's really bad news
[01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:19.280]   Um, so we yeah, we could talk about the supply chain shortages and how long it's gonna take you to get a
[01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:21.440]   Max studio
[01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:26.080]   Your o spread is it's not untenable. Yeah, it's not. Yeah, it's not it's unattainable
[01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:31.520]   It's unattainable and it and it's untenable and it's yeah, uh, a great human tragedy
[01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:36.800]   Just gonna cause so much pain just sticking to it. Yeah. Yeah, I'm fully convinced of that
[01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:38.720]   Although, you know
[01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:44.720]   We're still making people give facts that in wear their masks there's stuff you can do without locking the you know sealing
[01:24:44.720 --> 01:24:47.920]   Building the last mandate at least for five more days. Yeah
[01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:53.760]   Yeah, but but then again, we didn't have almost started we weren't the epicenter of the epidemic
[01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:59.040]   And so there the day the early days of the epidemic in china were pretty horrific
[01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:04.960]   Uh, and this was this was I'd like to think that the swift response that other countries had was seeing
[01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:11.920]   Exactly how badly it hit certain cities in china with a medical system that was unprepared for disease that nobody knew anything about
[01:25:11.920 --> 01:25:19.440]   So I I I can understand academically I can understand the depth and the intensity of the government's response
[01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:24.320]   But yeah, they're not they they've it seems as though they have been enforcing rules that they are not
[01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:28.800]   The government is not equipped to support the citizens and saying well, yes, we will lock you down
[01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:34.080]   But we will take care of you will make sure that you are well supplied you are well equipped that your health is well taken care of
[01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:41.600]   That we are not going to do more damage than we absolutely have to but when you're really tearing families apart and saying here's here's a bag of groceries
[01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:45.440]   That may or may not work for you. Good luck. If you need medical care. Good luck
[01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:47.440]   It's not good
[01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:50.080]   Graham tate is an australian based photographer
[01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:55.200]   Traveling in the flinders ranges with $7,000 worth of gear
[01:25:55.200 --> 01:26:00.240]   It was stolen from his car in the parking lot of his hotel fortunately
[01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:02.880]   He had air tags attached
[01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:08.400]   To the items he opened the find my app found the location of his stolen gear
[01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:14.080]   Now i'm going to insist that he did not go then to that location and you shouldn't either
[01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:16.480]   He called the police
[01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:20.320]   And was fortunate that in this case the police responded instead of saying yeah, right
[01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:23.440]   And was able to recover everything including his wallet
[01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:29.120]   His laptop is camera and gopro. The items were found in a room in the same hotel
[01:26:29.120 --> 01:26:33.760]   So yeah, so yeah puts he is nice
[01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:37.440]   It's nice to click on that story with that headline and not have it
[01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:42.480]   You're I was sort of tensing myself to for like paragraph nine to say he actually didn't own the air pod
[01:26:42.480 --> 01:26:45.600]   The air pod was slipped into the bag by another thief who intended to drop
[01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:54.000]   All right, anything else that we we should talk about weird story from Linus tech tips
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.880]   I don't know if you saw it, but he got swindled out of $90,000
[01:26:56.880 --> 01:27:01.040]   Because somebody hacked his contractor while he was busy redoing his house
[01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:06.080]   And they they jumped onto an existing thread saying that if well if you give us a bank draft for
[01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:11.840]   $90,000 will cut this much money off of the price and because it was part of the ongoing conversation
[01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:16.400]   They thought it was legitimate sent the check off a couple days later their contactor said they were hacked
[01:27:16.560 --> 01:27:19.760]   He's like, well, why didn't you tell me that earlier and then spent like a
[01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:25.280]   Few days trying to get the RCMP which is like the Canadian FBI to help and they were not helpful but a
[01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:32.160]   listener a viewer managed to get the the bank in Toronto involved and then the Toronto RCMP seemed to get involved
[01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:36.960]   But it's just like the the amount of the the quality of social engineering attacks
[01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:42.560]   Is getting so high now that like there's believe nothing. It's gonna be so careful. Send no money
[01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:46.560]   Always use a second channel to authenticate the first channel
[01:27:46.560 --> 01:27:51.360]   Oh my god, I'm terrified. I'm paying my bills by travel is checks from now on
[01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:58.640]   Can you still get travel is checks? That would be that would be a good challenge that
[01:27:58.640 --> 01:28:04.320]   That should be for the for the next I don't know if Linus tech tips is doing their
[01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:08.960]   That they they do these challenges with travelers exactly
[01:28:09.440 --> 01:28:12.880]   By bill build a thousand you have a budget of a thousand dollars
[01:28:12.880 --> 01:28:18.960]   You you have to pay with travel is check there are younger people listening Andy who do not know what travelers checks are I believe
[01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:24.400]   They don't even know who call them all than this. No god. Don't leave home without it. Not even through his movie work
[01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:28.960]   In the old days kids before atms
[01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:34.880]   If you went to a foreign land you would buy before you went you would buy something called travelers checks
[01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:37.280]   often from american express
[01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:39.600]   You would sign the front
[01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:42.160]   But not the back
[01:28:42.160 --> 01:28:45.680]   Then when you arrived in a foreign land you would go to an american express office
[01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:52.800]   And you would sign the back in front of the teller and they would give you the dollar value of the travelers checks in the local currency
[01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:58.880]   Lo and behold you also used to be able to get mail at the american express offices. Yeah, that's how old I am
[01:28:58.880 --> 01:29:03.200]   I'm looking at that. I I'm so lucky
[01:29:03.840 --> 01:29:08.000]   I'm just young enough that like the first time like when I was 20 years old
[01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:13.200]   I traveled on business like I had I had a look for an atm that supported my network back in boston
[01:29:13.200 --> 01:29:15.520]   But I was able to simply like take out money from there
[01:29:15.520 --> 01:29:21.920]   And my my dad who traveled a lot because he was he was an engineer for like electrical power companies part of his career
[01:29:21.920 --> 01:29:25.200]   It's like all the infrastructure he had taught me about like
[01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:28.880]   It was like all dad all I got to do is like
[01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:31.920]   Everything
[01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:37.040]   Believe of course you have to pay a huge exchange rate nine dollars in transaction fees as well, but
[01:29:37.040 --> 01:29:42.320]   You have to pay for transaction for travelers checks. They still offer them by the way
[01:29:42.320 --> 01:29:45.680]   CHE Q us
[01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:52.480]   For more than a century our travelers checks have helped travelers protect their money
[01:29:52.480 --> 01:29:57.200]   Anything that you would rely on when around the world in 80 days
[01:29:57.200 --> 01:30:00.800]   It was Lloyd's bank in american express
[01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:02.560]   Uh
[01:30:02.560 --> 01:30:05.200]   Wow one thing we didn't mention and it's it's not worth the whole thing
[01:30:05.200 --> 01:30:07.280]   But there's a lovely scene apple put up a
[01:30:07.280 --> 01:30:14.080]   May the fourth be with you video with skywalker audio and they have a lovely scene of their server room just replete with mac pros
[01:30:14.080 --> 01:30:19.120]   Oh, yes, this this was actually pretty cool. Let me let me let me find that
[01:30:19.120 --> 01:30:25.440]   There's nothing that r2d2 can't make adorable even when it's just his sound. Yeah, it's uh, can I you think I could play it?
[01:30:27.280 --> 01:30:30.560]   I'm on youtube. I feel like it's on youtube. I should be able to play it, right?
[01:30:30.560 --> 01:30:34.320]   Let me just play it without going full screen. You were to close your eyes
[01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:40.240]   And just listen to the sounds could you identify the movie?
[01:30:40.240 --> 01:30:43.440]   And where we are in the movie
[01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:46.560]   Everything is just so I think so
[01:30:46.560 --> 01:30:49.520]   This is the one you're talking about, right?
[01:30:49.520 --> 01:30:54.720]   Yeah, as long as we critique it. It's fair usely. Yeah, we're continuing like oh, that's Star Wars. That's holy Star Wars
[01:30:54.720 --> 01:30:56.720]   So, uh, what's he using?
[01:30:56.720 --> 01:31:01.280]   Using a um, that is a stormtrooper. I guess they couldn't afford a color or camera
[01:31:01.280 --> 01:31:04.720]   They're not apple displays. So I think that's why they keep the logos really
[01:31:04.720 --> 01:31:08.240]   Oh, they're not apple displays. Um, there's a
[01:31:08.240 --> 01:31:11.760]   There are there are mac books and they are mac pros and are they using logic or
[01:31:11.760 --> 01:31:16.560]   The old post was actually say the name postman says pro tools
[01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:19.760]   Which means you can't use a macOS monoray
[01:31:21.120 --> 01:31:24.560]   You can't even use Catalina. I love how much fun they're having
[01:31:24.560 --> 01:31:26.960]   Nice
[01:31:26.960 --> 01:31:31.440]   May the four oh, there's a film. Wait a minute. This is yeah, that's the trailer. No, it's the next the other
[01:31:31.440 --> 01:31:36.400]   Okay, trailer came out. Oh, man. There are some color parts, but again, I think they're going out of their way to not show
[01:31:36.400 --> 01:31:42.080]   They're not apple stuff. It's hysterical. Well, good. I just played the tease. You can't fault me for that. Exactly
[01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:44.720]   You're helping drive traffic
[01:31:44.720 --> 01:31:45.920]   You're being a good
[01:31:45.920 --> 01:31:50.400]   The way it works is like it's all robots like if they sense it the content ID system will flag it
[01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:51.840]   And then you just got a thing. No, I just
[01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:56.080]   I know it's the worst and they will never they will never well not never but like unless you're egregiously violating it
[01:31:56.080 --> 01:31:57.760]   They can't really do anything
[01:31:57.760 --> 01:32:02.640]   Well, they can demonetize they I mean, there's all sorts of stuff they can do and then you have to fight it
[01:32:02.640 --> 01:32:08.480]   Yeah, well, it's just like you just say no, it's wrong and then like usually within a couple days or like the same day a lot of times
[01:32:08.480 --> 01:32:14.480]   It's cleaned up. Oh, yeah, not been our experience. We'll say no, it's wrong and then they'll say come come get us big boy
[01:32:14.480 --> 01:32:20.640]   It's not a good system
[01:32:20.640 --> 01:32:24.240]   No
[01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:26.720]   All right
[01:32:26.720 --> 01:32:32.160]   I guess we could talk about the fact that apple better and google and everyone else better mind their peas and cues because
[01:32:32.160 --> 01:32:36.720]   The uk antitrust body will be able to find apple and google
[01:32:36.720 --> 01:32:40.880]   5% of their global revenue every day
[01:32:41.920 --> 01:32:46.560]   Yeah, that means in three weeks you make no money revenue cheese
[01:32:46.560 --> 01:32:50.320]   cheese
[01:32:50.320 --> 01:32:54.160]   Uh, I find it odd that you can sue based that you can find based on global revenue
[01:32:54.160 --> 01:32:59.200]   That doesn't that seems like an overreach. Yeah, well, that's that's that's that's the sort of
[01:32:59.200 --> 01:33:02.720]   Damocles that they need to have like the poison pill to make sure that people
[01:33:02.720 --> 01:33:06.960]   Companies like apple and and facebook and google aren't just gonna simply wake stuff out
[01:33:06.960 --> 01:33:09.920]   This and this shows the money that's
[01:33:10.960 --> 01:33:13.920]   Well, like all these countries are gonna say we want money. We're gonna just take it
[01:33:13.920 --> 01:33:20.400]   They they they they want they want a solution so that they actually get what they want and what they want isn't money
[01:33:20.400 --> 01:33:25.920]   They want they want people to operate by the rules that the EU and the individual local governments have actually created
[01:33:25.920 --> 01:33:32.000]   They know they know that once they start once they start asking for like 200 billion dollars from a company
[01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.880]   They they you know, they they know that at that point
[01:33:34.880 --> 01:33:39.680]   That's when you were no longer prime minister and the new prime minister is being well backed
[01:33:39.680 --> 01:33:42.720]   And they they're for they used to run the iPod division, you know
[01:33:42.720 --> 01:33:47.600]   But this just that this just comes to show you that why you should if you're interested in the subject
[01:33:47.600 --> 01:33:52.720]   You need to absolutely follow what what the EU is deciding because the EU is EU is a
[01:33:52.720 --> 01:33:59.520]   Antitrust and privacy legislation is very much being written as a template for all governments everywhere
[01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:00.960]   And so every government is looking at it
[01:34:00.960 --> 01:34:08.720]   So if if the United States government ever seriously got its act together about antitrust and was able to really develop
[01:34:09.200 --> 01:34:10.320]   broad
[01:34:10.320 --> 01:34:15.600]   Broad across the alis support for the sort of thing it would be something very very similar to what the EU
[01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:18.240]   Paston is going to be enacted in 2023
[01:34:18.240 --> 01:34:22.480]   Not that I don't realize it's complicated and nuanced and there's a lot of stuff that needs to be worked out
[01:34:22.480 --> 01:34:29.360]   But john Gruber had a fabulous noted design and security experts at the EU decided to remake apple pay article that I thought was
[01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:34.400]   typically snarky in the Gruber fashion, but I'm always I'm always wary because they
[01:34:35.120 --> 01:34:39.440]   The EU I find has really really good concepts and really terrible implementations
[01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:43.680]   And I've never seen one of their antitrust things work out the way that I as a consumer
[01:34:43.680 --> 01:34:46.720]   And I keep mentioning this but like they effectively destroyed web rendering engines
[01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:52.400]   I only have chromium and web kit now effectively. I just wish that they're their policies were
[01:34:52.400 --> 01:34:58.400]   Um, let's write we're more in the spirit of competitiveness and not in sort of the my opiate
[01:34:58.400 --> 01:35:02.480]   They always get dragged down into well. It's well. It's interesting. There was a finding this isn't part of the
[01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:08.800]   Of the 2023 act, but there was a finding that he sort of attached to it left or was passed saying that oh by the way
[01:35:08.800 --> 01:35:15.760]   The fact that the only web rendering engine that it's being allowed on ios is apple's web at rendering engine similar for google
[01:35:15.760 --> 01:35:21.280]   That's that's not going to fly either. You're going to have to allow competing web rendering engines on your platforms
[01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:26.640]   That's it. I don't I think there's going to be a lot of pain associated with these laws
[01:35:26.640 --> 01:35:31.840]   The question is is it going to achieve much much more than the pain that's going to be suffered? That's always the question
[01:35:31.920 --> 01:35:36.080]   I'm kind of I'm kind of okay if if if it's no longer
[01:35:36.080 --> 01:35:41.920]   As easy to do certain things so long as it's solving really really major problems as long as I don't have to worry
[01:35:41.920 --> 01:35:46.080]   About as long as I have more options as long as I have more opportunities. I'm perfectly okay
[01:35:46.080 --> 01:35:51.040]   I think that'll be okay for everybody the old joke was that the justice department really only cared about lowest pricing
[01:35:51.040 --> 01:35:54.320]   They didn't care about any sort of real competitiveness if you could get a lower price
[01:35:54.320 --> 01:35:59.120]   Like if amazon was willing to undercut people that was fine as long as it was lower price and the eu cared about
[01:35:59.520 --> 01:36:05.200]   Competitiveness but in an abstract where it was like a force competitiveness that wasn't always in the best interest of the consumer
[01:36:05.200 --> 01:36:10.240]   And I have this this romantic notion of them looking at a market getting the best people involved in it
[01:36:10.240 --> 01:36:14.960]   Like the brightest people who understand that market deeply and figure out laws that make it better for me as a customer
[01:36:14.960 --> 01:36:19.520]   Because sometimes the lowest price isn't what I need or want and sometimes just having a bunch of companies do it
[01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:25.520]   Isn't what I need or want there's like there's a lot of different solutions across this and I just like there's such a big and powerful thing
[01:36:25.520 --> 01:36:30.480]   I wish they were they took the process more seriously that is actually what commissioner cons
[01:36:30.480 --> 01:36:33.360]   What a lot of his her dogma is about that
[01:36:33.360 --> 01:36:38.320]   Part of part of her thesis isn't just that hey tech prims are too big they need to be knocked down a pig
[01:36:38.320 --> 01:36:41.040]   But part of it is that we need to start stop considering
[01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:48.880]   Making how much are people paying for for a pair of set of snow tires the only criteria for whether a monopoly exists
[01:36:48.880 --> 01:36:54.720]   They need to they need to ask what is what are what is the consumer experience like what is consumer options like?
[01:36:54.800 --> 01:37:01.760]   Is it is it giving them more power or is it being used to restrict their power which I think is a very 2022 attitude
[01:37:01.760 --> 01:37:03.840]   Uh
[01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:05.360]   I'm not an explorer
[01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:06.880]   Finally
[01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:10.240]   There's oh if there's a will there's a way now you could play fortnight
[01:37:10.240 --> 01:37:13.680]   On any device picking of which for free
[01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:15.600]   Speaking of which
[01:37:15.600 --> 01:37:19.040]   Uh xbox cloud gaming no subscription required
[01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:22.880]   You can play with touch or play with a controller you can use safari right
[01:37:23.760 --> 01:37:30.880]   Um, it won't work on my browser firebox. I'm epic was so happy. Yeah fortnight is everywhere. You cannot escape it
[01:37:30.880 --> 01:37:34.480]   You can get your view box
[01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:36.480]   bit on the web right there
[01:37:36.480 --> 01:37:42.640]   All right, let's take a little time out and get your picks ready if you would boys and girls
[01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:47.200]   But first a word from our sponsor and actually
[01:37:47.200 --> 01:37:51.440]   I know john's been playing with it because he's been doing some wild
[01:37:52.080 --> 01:37:59.040]   Transitions with our new tricaster to elite that is the latest tricaster that we are using
[01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:02.000]   The most complete live production system on the planet
[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:06.800]   And john has been playing with all those new features too every once in a while
[01:38:06.800 --> 01:38:14.080]   Strange things will happen new tech is an amazing company went back when I started twit in 2005
[01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:18.560]   I was looking for actually was when I started doing videos. So maybe a couple of years later
[01:38:18.880 --> 01:38:23.200]   We were looking for a way to switch video live a way I could do it at the same time as I was doing a show
[01:38:23.200 --> 01:38:30.880]   And they're just it was a no brainer. That's when we started using tricaster. We have not stopped in more than 15 years
[01:38:30.880 --> 01:38:32.960]   There you go
[01:38:32.960 --> 01:38:35.600]   The tricaster to elite is our current model
[01:38:35.600 --> 01:38:37.680]   Pretty impressive
[01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:42.480]   For instance, we've got that point tilt pan tilt zoom camera over my head
[01:38:42.480 --> 01:38:46.320]   Which is connected with one wire power over ethernet
[01:38:47.360 --> 01:38:51.120]   And ndi means that camera can feed our tricaster
[01:38:51.120 --> 01:38:57.200]   Over the network digital interface and get its power all from one cable. That's remarkable
[01:38:57.200 --> 01:39:04.240]   Uh, it's an all-encompassing digital media solution to create content for the internet mobile television distribution
[01:39:04.240 --> 01:39:11.680]   Uh late last year they released the updated version of the tricaster to elite. That's what we got the new one lots of new features
[01:39:12.160 --> 01:39:16.800]   The much loved live call connect feature now supports facebook messenger
[01:39:16.800 --> 01:39:20.400]   What's app and facetime as inputs to any production in addition?
[01:39:20.400 --> 01:39:29.040]   Selectable audio and video returns now enables the tricaster to elite operators to view an audio return like any other output allowing greater flexibility
[01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:34.080]   They've got this new neural voice isolation tool to clean your audio
[01:39:34.080 --> 01:39:39.120]   Using ai the system can cancel or reduce background noise and automatically detect voices
[01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:46.080]   Maintaining all important production quality really widely used in churches and sporting events television stations
[01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:49.440]   The tricaster to elite is an entire production
[01:39:49.440 --> 01:39:54.080]   Facility in a box increased power increased flexibility
[01:39:54.080 --> 01:39:59.600]   But simplicity so have driven some of the exciting new capabilities with variable support
[01:39:59.600 --> 01:40:05.040]   In macros the system offers a dynamic and powerful tool that allows operators to nest macros
[01:40:05.440 --> 01:40:13.120]   Deliver complex productions more easily little pro tip little secret. That's that's how I run my tricaster in my other studio
[01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:18.720]   It's all macros, baby and it'll all work tricaster to elite now supports encoding of three channels
[01:40:18.720 --> 01:40:21.920]   Anything from hd to uhd all at the same time
[01:40:21.920 --> 01:40:25.840]   Which is fantastic greater power and flexibility of productions
[01:40:25.840 --> 01:40:33.200]   They've brought the live panel builder into the tricaster meaning users can create bespoke user interfaces and customize each preset
[01:40:33.520 --> 01:40:40.880]   Within the user interface making your distributed workflows simpler more cohesive and never never compromising on quality
[01:40:40.880 --> 01:40:47.680]   Quality and creativity have not been forgotten as operators now see the resolution and frame rate of every video source
[01:40:47.680 --> 01:40:52.720]   Coming into their tricaster to ensure they can always be confident of the quality of their sources
[01:40:52.720 --> 01:40:59.120]   The ndi genlock tool allows tricaster to elite users to match outputs to a common sync pulse
[01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:05.280]   Alex lindsey will tell you how important that is so you know exactly when to send a frame of video for pinpoint accuracy
[01:41:05.280 --> 01:41:11.680]   It's perfect for remote workflows. You can now send alpha channel through one of the mix outs bringing post production closer to live
[01:41:11.680 --> 01:41:17.360]   Users can use the keying on tricaster to feed graphics or real-time 3d creation tools
[01:41:17.360 --> 01:41:23.760]   Since it's arrival in 2020 the tricaster to elite has offered incredibly powerful live production system
[01:41:24.320 --> 01:41:31.680]   The very latest updates which we have now i'm so happy to say put even more power in the hands of storytellers everywhere tricaster to

[01:42:19.680 --> 01:42:25.120]   newtech.com/twit- tv don't forget the dash
[01:42:25.120 --> 01:42:29.840]   I just love the new tech stuff and now I want to tricaster one pro
[01:42:29.840 --> 01:42:32.720]   Did we get did they give us the option?
[01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:35.360]   Did they say you can have the tricaster to elite?
[01:42:35.360 --> 01:42:37.280]   Ah
[01:42:37.280 --> 01:42:39.680]   This is brand new this new one. This just came out
[01:42:39.680 --> 01:42:48.000]   All right, okay get it. Let's get on the horn. I always want the latest visit go.newtech.com/twit
[01:42:48.560 --> 01:42:50.560]   dash tv
[01:42:50.560 --> 01:42:52.720]   now time
[01:42:52.720 --> 01:42:56.880]   For the picks of the week Andy and not co can start us off Andrew
[01:42:56.880 --> 01:43:01.680]   Uh, this is a really esoteric but interesting app I came across recently
[01:43:01.680 --> 01:43:07.920]   It's called blur screen and all it does is it will blur sections of your screen on command
[01:43:07.920 --> 01:43:11.200]   So that if you're doing like a live stream and you're doing the hey
[01:43:11.200 --> 01:43:16.880]   Or you're even recording a video recording a screen capture of hey and here's what it's like
[01:43:16.960 --> 01:43:21.920]   Here's how to log into the system and this is the point which you don't want people to see your username or your password
[01:43:21.920 --> 01:43:28.640]   Instead of like recording it to video and then using post-production you can just simply activate this this plugin
[01:43:28.640 --> 01:43:36.240]   Uh draw a rectangle on the screen and select how blurry it's going to be and then like that section of the screen is just blurred out
[01:43:36.240 --> 01:43:38.800]   It's also nice because you can activate it by hotkey
[01:43:38.800 --> 01:43:44.080]   So again if you're pre recording you can you know that this is the this is the area of the screen that I will want to have blurred
[01:43:44.080 --> 01:43:49.360]   Out when I demonstrate this part of it so you can just blah blah blah blah click this do this and then hit command B
[01:43:49.360 --> 01:43:54.880]   And now suddenly that part is blurred out while you're typing in your thing and then you go to the next part you can unblur it
[01:43:54.880 --> 01:44:00.640]   It's it seems to do a very very simple thing such a simple thing that I was surprised that I I was like there must be something else
[01:44:00.640 --> 01:44:05.520]   Like this uh out there somewhere and there kind of really isn't there a lot of individual apps for
[01:44:05.520 --> 01:44:13.440]   uh graphic designers that will make it very very easy to I'm gonna drag this image onto this app and then I can black out parts of a user ID or
[01:44:13.440 --> 01:44:20.080]   Whatever like this. This is this is the only one that I can come across that seems to be for live streamers
[01:44:20.080 --> 01:44:24.720]   It'll work with zoom. It'll work with most screen sharing sort of apps
[01:44:24.720 --> 01:44:28.880]   Or if you're or again for screen capture for for for
[01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:32.240]   Capturing what you're doing on your screen while you're doing it
[01:44:32.240 --> 01:44:34.800]   And it's not that expensive it's 20 bucks, but you own it
[01:44:34.800 --> 01:44:39.840]   It's not like 20 bucks like a year for for that and it it strikes me as something that
[01:44:40.400 --> 01:44:45.040]   If you don't need it, you will never use it, but there are people listening to what's the give the URL
[01:44:45.040 --> 01:44:47.040]   But give the URL this is exactly a solution
[01:44:47.040 --> 01:44:52.560]   It'll if most of your post processing is like now what now they've gotten the video editor
[01:44:52.560 --> 01:44:55.440]   Now I have to edit out all this stuff. I don't want people to see
[01:44:55.440 --> 01:45:00.320]   It's nice to be able to do this stuff live or in camera so to speak without having to deal with it later
[01:45:00.320 --> 01:45:02.320]   So I thought it that seems to work pretty well
[01:45:02.320 --> 01:45:06.880]   Now I can go 4k and just blur my face perfect solution here you go
[01:45:07.120 --> 01:45:11.760]   I just if I didn't shave this morning, there you go. Just blur from like here down blur screen dot app
[01:45:11.760 --> 01:45:14.400]   Bob your l-u-r-s-c-r-e-e-n dot app
[01:45:14.400 --> 01:45:17.680]   Renee red jay pick of the week
[01:45:17.680 --> 01:45:19.440]   So this just came out today
[01:45:19.440 --> 01:45:25.200]   And I always like to keep these pics super fresh if I can and it is the dgi mini 3 pro
[01:45:25.200 --> 01:45:28.480]   I have a mini 2 and the reason that the minis are so important
[01:45:28.480 --> 01:45:31.680]   Is that a lot of jurisdictions have clamped down on drones, you know as well
[01:45:31.680 --> 01:45:34.880]   They should have and for over I think it's 250 grams
[01:45:35.120 --> 01:45:37.760]   You need to basically register it with your local flight authority
[01:45:37.760 --> 01:45:40.720]   I think in some places you got to take the equivalent of a pilot's license
[01:45:40.720 --> 01:45:46.640]   But they're highly highly regulated with tons of areas that you just like people will tattle on you super fast
[01:45:46.640 --> 01:45:51.040]   So this is like a 249 or something like one gram one ounce. I forget the measurement
[01:45:51.040 --> 01:45:56.320]   Right below the legal limit so you can actually use this in a lot of areas
[01:45:56.320 --> 01:45:58.800]   And this is a caveat
[01:45:58.800 --> 01:46:01.120]   This is what my gjelgen had when we were in mexico
[01:46:01.120 --> 01:46:03.920]   And it was great because you could just whip it out anywhere
[01:46:04.560 --> 01:46:07.840]   And and get great footage because it's so light. It's so little
[01:46:07.840 --> 01:46:10.000]   There's still there's no fly zone still like for example
[01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:11.680]   The app won't let you use it near an airport
[01:46:11.680 --> 01:46:16.240]   So there are places where it's heavily risk and some some places are completely restricted just because of the government
[01:46:16.240 --> 01:46:19.280]   But it lets you use it any place where it's not dangerous to use
[01:46:19.280 --> 01:46:22.080]   And the big difference between this and the two is one
[01:46:22.080 --> 01:46:25.360]   This has higher capacity batteries if you really need to use it longer
[01:46:25.360 --> 01:46:26.480]   They are heavier though
[01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:29.920]   So you will then have to go through the whole normal drone process if you want to use those
[01:46:29.920 --> 01:46:33.120]   But you can get like 30 minutes with just the built-in batteries here
[01:46:33.280 --> 01:46:36.640]   This is iJustines a video using the M3 pro
[01:46:36.640 --> 01:46:37.520]   Yeah
[01:46:37.520 --> 01:46:38.640]   Yeah
[01:46:38.640 --> 01:46:43.120]   You need to find something you need to find somebody in your life who looks at you the way Justine looks
[01:46:43.120 --> 01:46:45.440]   At the controller that she discovers
[01:46:45.440 --> 01:46:49.200]   She didn't think there was an included controller. She sees there's a controller with a screen
[01:46:49.200 --> 01:46:52.080]   She lights up in a way that you've just got to find something you like
[01:46:52.080 --> 01:46:54.880]   Because in the past you've used an iPhone or an iPad right
[01:46:54.880 --> 01:46:57.520]   Yeah
[01:46:57.520 --> 01:46:59.520]   And a touch
[01:46:59.520 --> 01:47:05.600]   Yeah
[01:47:05.600 --> 01:47:10.160]   The great thing about iJustine is that her reputation is like you know that's a genuine like reaction
[01:47:10.160 --> 01:47:11.440]   It's not supposed to
[01:47:11.440 --> 01:47:15.680]   Now get ready to shoot the thumbnail producer because i'm going to be really a big one i go
[01:47:15.680 --> 01:47:17.120]   Oh my god
[01:47:17.120 --> 01:47:19.520]   I like it though that i don't have that i that it has
[01:47:19.520 --> 01:47:21.680]   The controller
[01:47:21.680 --> 01:47:23.600]   Has its own thing built in that's fine
[01:47:23.600 --> 01:47:26.720]   So no one tries to face time you or call your message while you're using it
[01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:31.440]   And also this has four sensors two on the top and two on the bottom for dodging like
[01:47:31.440 --> 01:47:33.600]   Uh good because i need that
[01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:38.400]   The mini two didn't so like if you were if you were flying at someplace you should be flying to it's really easy
[01:47:38.400 --> 01:47:41.840]   I know this from personal experience it would bounce off. Yeah, that's not good for a drone
[01:47:41.840 --> 01:47:44.000]   So this actually will avoid obstacles
[01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:47.360]   For you, which makes it much more useful and the camera pivots
[01:47:47.360 --> 01:47:52.640]   So that if you are doing like for example if your son is doing the tick-tock and he wants to zoom in on his cooking
[01:47:52.640 --> 01:47:56.400]   You don't have to crop anymore. You can just rotate the camera to portrait mode
[01:47:56.800 --> 01:48:00.400]   Film all your videos that way so he flies into the window right into the kitchen
[01:48:00.400 --> 01:48:03.760]   Just down on the table just in time for the flambe whatever you need
[01:48:03.760 --> 01:48:08.480]   Uh, which is great because there are shorts and reels and tick-tocks and all those things right now
[01:48:08.480 --> 01:48:10.960]   I may have to get this
[01:48:10.960 --> 01:48:12.960]   Uh, do you think i won't be able to crash it?
[01:48:12.960 --> 01:48:19.120]   No, no, you'll crash it for sure, but there's a bonus pack you can get that has extra batteries and extra propellers
[01:48:19.120 --> 01:48:22.400]   Oh, you know, hopefully it'll it'll resist at least a couple times
[01:48:22.400 --> 01:48:25.920]   I'm thinking i'd like to bring this uh with me to alaska it might be kind of fun
[01:48:25.920 --> 01:48:29.120]   Peter mckinnon had some footage he filmed on a lake in italy and it is
[01:48:29.120 --> 01:48:34.880]   Unbelievably good looking as a 48 megapixel sensor on the camera, uh, so it shoots really really crisp
[01:48:34.880 --> 01:48:40.320]   Beautiful looking video. That's a big sacrifice and a lot of these little ones is you don't have a good camera
[01:48:40.320 --> 01:48:42.960]   That's pretty impressive. Yeah, and you can do though
[01:48:42.960 --> 01:48:46.800]   It's not like first person like some drones are first person and you actually feel like you're flying it
[01:48:46.800 --> 01:48:49.520]   Um, but if you're if you're if you're a good enough video game player
[01:48:49.520 --> 01:48:52.400]   You can do those shots where like you fly through the open door right?
[01:48:52.400 --> 01:48:58.400]   You know, so you could use it really impressive. FPV is very hard to do. Yeah, uh, yeah, it's you know
[01:48:58.400 --> 01:49:04.880]   It's kind of cool if you get really good at it, but it's very very you got to really practice a lot
[01:49:04.880 --> 01:49:09.440]   And this stuff is just gorgeous looking does this have the follow me thing because that's the other thing
[01:49:09.440 --> 01:49:11.920]   Yeah, it looks like it does it has tracking. Yes. Yeah
[01:49:11.920 --> 01:49:16.480]   So I I can get on the cruise and just say follow us
[01:49:16.480 --> 01:49:19.760]   As long as it's cruise legal
[01:49:20.720 --> 01:49:26.480]   I don't know if it's cruise legal. Okay, but a lot of beaches are fine with it
[01:49:26.480 --> 01:49:32.400]   You know a lot of places a lot of parks are fine with it and like a lot of car like you there's fantastic car shots that you can get
[01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:36.640]   It's it's really nice. Wow. It's I love it that it has obstacle sensing and all
[01:49:36.640 --> 01:49:39.280]   All planes now
[01:49:39.280 --> 01:49:44.000]   This might be this might be finally the one that says you know what maybe this wouldn't be a foolish purchase handy
[01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:49.520]   It's always a full is always a foolish purchase for me right now. You have to reserve it
[01:49:49.520 --> 01:49:51.520]   You can't buy it yet
[01:49:51.520 --> 01:49:58.480]   So I'll just have to fill in my address and I think if you want it like act fast because what we've noticed about the last couple of years
[01:49:58.480 --> 01:50:01.440]   Is that you can buy things right away or have a really long wait?
[01:50:01.440 --> 01:50:06.080]   Yeah, like they made a hundred and they're not gonna make any more till 2025
[01:50:06.080 --> 01:50:12.800]   I don't know if you saw it, but like the Macbook was like, I don't know 70 70 odd days or something to get like a Mac book pro and some of the other stuff
[01:50:12.800 --> 01:50:18.080]   Crazy. Oh wait a minute. It won't be available till august. So I can't take it on the cruise. That's a relief
[01:50:18.480 --> 01:50:27.280]   You can get a map you can go to DJI mini too. I mean you're sorry. No, no, no, no, no, no, I I did order the uh snapchat selfie
[01:50:27.280 --> 01:50:28.800]   drone
[01:50:28.800 --> 01:50:31.360]   I figured I can't screw that up. There's nothing to steer with
[01:50:31.360 --> 01:50:35.440]   If it's cruise if it's if it's gonna screw up, it's just gonna have to screw itself up
[01:50:35.440 --> 01:50:44.080]   I figure Lindsey must have an ornithopter for his iPhone. Oh, wouldn't that be cool with the flapping wings? Yeah, he leave gyro
[01:50:46.160 --> 01:50:54.080]   We have come to the conclusion of this gripping thrilling edition of mac break weekly the day the ipod died
[01:50:54.080 --> 01:51:02.080]   Thousand songs in my pocket
[01:51:02.080 --> 01:51:07.200]   Andy and ako wgbh is calling when will you respond?
[01:51:07.200 --> 01:51:12.720]   I am off this week this week, but I'll be back next week until then you can see everything that I've been done for the last
[01:51:13.280 --> 01:51:15.280]   Few years on wgbh news.org
[01:51:15.280 --> 01:51:19.040]   You can stream it wherever you want to usually break up my own segment
[01:51:19.040 --> 01:51:21.520]   segments into their own actual link
[01:51:21.520 --> 01:51:28.880]   I have a plug you can watch my son salt hank in the sandwich battle tonight on access hollywood
[01:51:28.880 --> 01:51:31.600]   I know who wins, but I can't tell you
[01:51:31.600 --> 01:51:38.720]   This is his second appearance in access hollywood. I think he's becoming a celebrity
[01:51:40.640 --> 01:51:46.400]   Uh mr. Yes when you'll be the father you won't be like the star. I will be the star already am I know his dad
[01:51:46.400 --> 01:51:51.360]   Yeah, I'm the father your hank's dad. I'm hank's dad. What's what's you gonna wear to the metgal the next year?
[01:51:51.360 --> 01:51:57.360]   You know, that's a good question. I'll have to ask him. I bet he's going black chef's had I bet he's going
[01:51:57.360 --> 01:52:03.600]   Renee richy youtube.com/Renee richy you said you just did a video
[01:52:03.600 --> 01:52:07.360]   All about this whole back to work thing
[01:52:08.480 --> 01:52:13.760]   I'm looking at apples culture clash from retention through like whether people are happy with apple park
[01:52:13.760 --> 01:52:19.600]   People who have enough money. They don't have to work anymore if they don't want to people want to spend time with their rsu's if they can
[01:52:19.600 --> 01:52:27.360]   And then just what's what's gonna happen moving forward? So everything that's currently a battle. I think within apple apple for their future
[01:52:27.360 --> 01:52:31.280]   Finally is the name of the is the name of the piece
[01:52:31.280 --> 01:52:36.400]   You're gonna have to watch it. You gotta have to watch it to find out what he's talking about
[01:52:36.400 --> 01:52:38.720]   I'm trying to do videos that you won't see on any other youtube channel
[01:52:38.720 --> 01:52:39.520]   I like it
[01:52:39.520 --> 01:52:46.160]   Experimenting with not doing like b-roll. I'm trying to do the stuff that I can do good very rewarding so far. Good. That's so great
[01:52:46.160 --> 01:52:49.280]   Your point of view is what I love about your videos exactly
[01:52:49.280 --> 01:52:50.240]   So
[01:52:50.240 --> 01:52:57.760]   And we don't need to be we don't need the 13th hot take on something that really there's only there's really nothing to say about it except for to inform people
[01:52:57.760 --> 01:53:03.120]   It's happened. It's like you have such a great point of view and every time you have something to say about his topic
[01:53:03.440 --> 01:53:11.040]   It always makes me not necessarily reconsider what I thought that is something I hadn't I hadn't seen it from that this that direction before
[01:53:11.040 --> 01:53:16.400]   I'm gonna reconsider a few things. Absolutely. I get to hone them all here with you guys on Mac break. So you are my
[01:53:16.400 --> 01:53:18.720]   Exactly
[01:53:18.720 --> 01:53:25.440]   I'm so I'm so lucky that like I'm on NPR on fridays because oftentimes I'll will written like that's that part of the segment like on like
[01:53:25.440 --> 01:53:30.720]   Monday night when the news hit then like suddenly I have to actually talk about it with three very very smart people like oh
