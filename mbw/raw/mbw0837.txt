[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.680]   It's time for Mac break weekly and Ian Ocko's here Mike as Sargent's filling in for Jason Snell
[00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.240]   Joining us for Alex Lindsey from Apple insider Steven Robles
[00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:16.320]   Steven and I both have the new Apple watch ultra will get our capsule reviews on the air plus a look at the new
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.840]   AirPods to the new AirPods Pro 2 and what to expect next month
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.920]   Will there be an Apple event? Maybe not. It's all coming up next on Mac break weekly

[00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.780]   It's just me and Andy and not go today
[00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.780]   Wg big h in Boston. Hello Andrew
[00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.740]   Hello, let's see the thing is like if it were just Alex I'd wonder okay some head of state
[00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.860]   This guy yeah, and we need and then a live stream if it were just Jason
[00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.320]   I just you know I think okay well he had like an overlap he has kids he's sending a kid off to college
[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:52.480]   Both of them makes me think that what is Apple releasing tomorrow that I don't know about that everybody needs to be briefed about or live streamed
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:58.500]   Exactly and now I'm going to stop everybody from tuning out because it's just me and Andy because it isn't just me and Andy
[00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.040]   Hey, hey
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:07.560]   Welcome Michael Sergeant always great to have you Mike a filling in at the last minute from iOS today and tech news weekly and the tech guy and
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:14.640]   And of course an Apple expert your timing is excellent. Did you get your watch? Did you get your watch today yesterday?
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.880]   Well, I've got my series eight. Yeah. Oh no you were waiting for your air pods. I was waiting for my air
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:27.640]   I like him so much. I put him on a land here. Look at you. You're carrying like it's a precious heirloom
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:34.880]   Yeah, yeah, there's a precious precious heirloom. We'll talk about that in a bit also from Apple insider great to have back to our
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.800]   Microfolds Steven this time I'm gonna say his name mate right Robles. Hello, Steven
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:47.600]   All right. Thank you. It's great to be here once again. Well, doing the beard back to the show beard FM
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.080]   That's his website so yeah
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:58.880]   Everybody got their ultra as the reviews have been out for a while Steven have you had one for a while? I
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.480]   Do I got one on launch day? There's the ultra with the white ocean band right there nice
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.280]   Oh, you have the ocean band I have the gray ocean band and at some point
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.280]   I'll bring in the did it take you a while to figure out how the ocean
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:17.800]   I read the instructions I copiously read I know about the second loop and putting it through
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.240]   Yeah, I think I threw the instructions out or something because so it comes with a
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:28.360]   Removable in fact, it's not even a touch when you get it second loop for the tab end and that I
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.480]   Didn't pay attention and I just put it around the back and which means I couldn't get the tab in at all
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.020]   Like it wouldn't fit. I thought well, that's this is I don't I
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.360]   Then I figured it out. I thought oh, there's holes there
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.080]   I could just thread it through a hole and now I quite like it and it's adjustable
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.840]   So that's because this is the one size fits all band even your wet I do like it
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:54.000]   I have been using a lot of my previous solo loops with the ultra because they are fit and they fit great
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.760]   Yeah, I was concerned about my pan and quill
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.880]   What mica what are you young people call those a cuff?
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.880]   Thank you. Oh, I was concerned about that because the whole cutout for the
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.720]   Back of the watch and it actually works. So everything's fine
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.160]   So that's good. We're here to report that your ultra as huge as it might be and
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:23.040]   I put this on Lisa's my wife's wrist and it really is too big for her. I said come on you would love this watch
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.800]   So what do you think mr. Roblith? I
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:31.000]   Really like it. I mean the battery life. I've been testing it when 48 hours
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:39.800]   Yeah off charger and it was still at 28% battery, which is pretty amazing and even did some deep-sea diving in my pool
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:51.800]   They did go down to five feet and so you assume that the Apple watch ultra submerged depth app comes up went down to five feet
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:57.240]   And it saw read the water temperature depth and it was pretty accurate. So I turn you know when you setting it up
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.360]   It says well
[00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.920]   If you go in water you want to know how deep you are and how cold it is and I said well of course
[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:08.600]   I do because if I fall off the Titanic it would be nice as I sink to know how far I've sunk
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:13.640]   But I maybe I'll scuba sometime. I have scuba in the past. I like scuba diving
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:18.600]   This is really though silly for a person like me to have because it's I mean it seemed for me
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:23.440]   I have no practical use for it the most action I've had is grocery shopping with Apple watch ultra
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:29.600]   But that larger display showing my grocery list that was that was key feature right there. It's a great experience
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:34.760]   I yeah, yeah, yeah, that's a good point. It's great for grocery shopping. I'm sure Apple put that in a next ad
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:41.240]   Yeah, I was shopping in the aisle. It's safe way when all of a sudden I couldn't remember iceberg or romaine
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.560]   Then my watch came to the rescue. I
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.200]   I
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:51.220]   Reach I reached into by a bundle of romaine and then that's when the automatic spritters came on it
[00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:56.240]   They gotta have the rugged version well things could have gotten pretty south pretty fast
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.980]   Let me tell you that you know in this shot it the close it does look kind of hunky chunky
[00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:06.040]   That's why that's why I'm looking forward to like designers coming forward with like more
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:14.020]   Substantial bands like like the 70s to have like those like gauntlets sort of things that like that maybe you'll look like real beefy and real hunky
[00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:15.180]   like
[00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:18.640]   The day that the day that it was showing off. I thought that oh my god
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:26.340]   There's gonna be such a market on Etsy for like women's watch women's Apple watch ultra bands that make you look like either Wonder Woman
[00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:33.280]   or Zina if you if you're going for one of if you're going for one of those like ultra marathon likes
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:38.120]   Mucker sort of things you're gonna want to have like the the Wonder Woman bracer the zina
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:42.680]   This would be good. Yeah for a mutter. Yeah, how deep and how cold is the mud?
[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.560]   yeah, I will say I watched a
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.480]   Okay, DC Rainmaker actually is a YouTube channel
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:54.060]   I just found it this morning and he tested the depth in one of those like cylindrical water
[00:06:54.060 --> 00:07:00.620]   And yeah, he brought it down all the way to 130 feet and that's when it stops measuring depth
[00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:05.480]   That's like the maximum at least in feet 130 feet and it stayed accurate with the gauge
[00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:12.960]   It's supposed to go to a thousand I mean a hundred meters, but that doesn't mean to you to measure
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:17.840]   Yeah, it does it does this cool thing that's very safe
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:22.880]   That says like it could probably measure beyond that but the screen just simply says okay. You're below 140 now
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:29.920]   I'm out. I'm not a I'm not your your your seems like a lot you have to be a specialized a diver right to go deeper than that
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:35.560]   Or no, yeah, I think that I think that's when you need mix. Yeah, yeah, but this is cool
[00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:42.960]   So this is a hyperbaric chamber for watches or something. He's got a it's got a pump on it and it can it can increase the water pressure
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:48.120]   Huh? Yeah, it's kind of it's good video. He said that he said that he had it commissioned
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:49.160]   He had it made so yeah
[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:55.600]   It made so long ago that like the tablet that he's he's using with is using like a look at the bezel on generation outdated
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:00.240]   but he but he was hoping that he could he would like be able to like a
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:04.880]   Depth test like all these waterproof and like water resistant watches to failure
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:10.640]   And then he found out that even when he bought like these really really crappy watches like off-a-value express like they don't just like
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:17.880]   Graphically fail in a cool way. They just usually just kind of keep working until they stop. Yeah, so Apple says is water resistant
[00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:24.040]   And yet they show people swimming in it and they say you can dive is it really can you is it water proof?
[00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:26.400]   Why don't they say water proof?
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:30.400]   Kind of certification for
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:38.240]   Deepsea diving to a hundred meters. I mean, it's pretty resistant I would say unless you can only do it for 10 seconds and then
[00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:41.240]   I mean, I don't know
[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:45.320]   My understanding last time I looked into it
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:50.840]   But yeah like a year two ago is that the the difference is usually that if it's waterproof
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:54.360]   That means that it has active measure active countermeasures against ingress
[00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:58.320]   Meaning that you have gaskets that are being held together by positive mechanical seals
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:05.480]   Whereas water resistant means that there's glue there's it's at some point this glue this system could fail at which point
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:09.000]   It doesn't at which point this ages out of the water resistant system
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.080]   IP stands for ingress protection and
[00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:19.480]   I don't what is the IP rating on this is it IP 68 68? Okay, so I guess six X
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:23.320]   Can resist high pressure heavy sprays of water?
[00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:28.920]   It's not about a water so is this a way that Apple can get out of
[00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:32.400]   Waranting it if it fails under water it seems
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:38.200]   They get out of warranty it by simply expressing that it's not it's not warranty against this water. They're good
[00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:45.560]   Yeah, it has a bunch of military spec certifications which are absolutely intense if you look at the entire library of certifications that come
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:52.400]   Under this category that they're that they're qualifying under a lot of it really is does it does it resist against chemical attack?
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:59.160]   Is it resist against acid doesn't resist against again fighting the fighting aliens on the so on the USS Salaco or something like that
[00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:04.680]   But however, I was excited when I saw that certification that I learned about the certification where it's passed against
[00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:08.120]   Certain elements of that but not the really really exciting one
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:15.400]   So if you are if you are on if your procurement requirements meaning we meaning your boss will your company will will
[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:19.800]   authorize the the procurement of this device so long so it has this kind of
[00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:27.360]   Certification it will pass some kinds of these super super intense field certifications, but not others, but it does indicate it does point out that
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:34.800]   People like me or thinking oh well, I'm either I'm an adventurer or I'm just wants a really cool big fancy watch
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:40.200]   But there are a lot of people who like working the work in the energy industries like we're working on oil derricks people who are working in
[00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:48.760]   Construction that they really do need something that they can they can use all day just as a regular like regular fitness watch or just as a regular smartwatch
[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:52.040]   They just need it to be super super durable even though they're not you know
[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:55.040]   They're not skydiving off of Everest or something like that
[00:10:55.040 --> 00:11:00.200]   They just they they're operating heavy equipment. They need something that's gonna that's gonna hold up to that Apple says
[00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:08.320]   rather Wikipedia says mill standard 810 which is the Apple standard they're saying we have mill spec 810 H3 is a
[00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:18.040]   Flexible standard that it allows users to tailor test methods to fit the application as a result of vendors claim of compliance to us mill standard 810
[00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:26.600]   Can be misleading because no commercial organization or agency certifies compliance. So okay fine. It's kind of meaningless
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:33.200]   It's I know you know, it's it's you could take it out into battle. I guess I don't know
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:36.560]   Yeah, so
[00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:40.120]   But the point is made in fact didn't somebody try to hammer it and
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:45.280]   Ended up hammering destroying the table some youtuber. Yeah, that's a typical
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:52.480]   Usually the Apple watch stopped working before the screen was actually shattered and so the shock to the internal is messed
[00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:56.840]   It up before the screen would break but I mean enough hits the screen shatter too. So yeah
[00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:58.840]   I'm not gonna hit it with a hammer
[00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:01.840]   You know, I might I might take it swimming
[00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:07.360]   I might do that it's heard about my wrist if it gets hit with a hammer than anything. Yeah, that's a good point
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:11.480]   But I have to say I love it. I'm not curious Stephen what you think
[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:16.000]   Unless Andy did you get one too? No, I think it's just me and Stephen at this point. Nope just you guys
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:23.080]   I like the bigger screen because I can actually type the passcode in the first time every time
[00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:28.840]   I are using the Wayfarer the new Wayfarer watch face
[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:34.920]   I typically used a modular watch face and that's one of the weird things with the display because it's larger
[00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:42.040]   It's scaled up all the watch faces and it feels a little sparse like it's not feeling like the normal modular would feel
[00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:46.000]   So that's what weird and that's why I'm using Wayfarer because I have eight complications
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:53.360]   Which I like I love I have love my hand if I double tap the bezel I can I can see what longitude and latitude I'm at
[00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:58.840]   Which is not all that useful, but and it has it and it has a compass on it
[00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:02.600]   It also does some really interesting things you can set waypoints
[00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:05.200]   So if like breadcrumbs if your hands will incredible
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:11.960]   It'll you can drop waypoints as you're as you're hiking which means if you go on off trail at least you'll be able to maybe get back
[00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:16.600]   One of the waypoints can be where your car is parked. So for me, that's more useful
[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:20.600]   Importantly that is a that is a watch OS
[00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:29.240]   Feature and so and yours do it too. Yeah any modern Apple watch is able to do the wayfinding thing. Oh, well never mind then iOS today
[00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:31.240]   post I
[00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:36.920]   Just I just think you can't do a lot of to latitude can you I cannot but that's just easily one of the coolest features in my
[00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:42.520]   Opinion the wayfinding thing I do like to do this very cool. I was excited to see it was available multiple watches
[00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:45.840]   I just as you say Steve in my battery life
[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:51.120]   So they want you to sleep with it on five nights in a row so that you can project your ovulation
[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:57.360]   Which I'm excited about so I have been sleeping with it on only hit least a once last night
[00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:02.560]   Which was which was good because this can leave quite a mark and and
[00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:08.640]   Battery life overnight is like six percent loss actually was like more even like four percent losses very low
[00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:12.920]   I wore it overnight last night all day yesterday with a workout
[00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:16.920]   It was down to 53% after a full 24 hours
[00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:23.200]   So that bodes well for 48 hour battery life charge it up in less than an hour while I was having breakfast
[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:27.640]   This is a watch you can if you might not want to but it is certainly when you can wear all the time
[00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:30.280]   And then that's what I did I sleep with mine
[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:35.200]   I slept with my series 7 and earlier watches anyway for sleep tracking and with like the two-day battery life
[00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:42.120]   It's pretty nice. Yeah, I swear it overnight and the charger it did charge up very quickly quicker than I would have thought being a larger battery
[00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:48.040]   But if you have that faster charging capability like the series 7 did and you have a charger that supports it
[00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:53.440]   It charged up very quickly. I was surprised as little disappointed for 700 or 800 bucks. It should come with a better
[00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:56.240]   Pock comes the same puck that the other
[00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:59.720]   Lestar braided cable though. Oh, it's true. It is braided
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:05.280]   I'll watch cable. Yeah, so the old edition watches would come with that fancy, you know, ultra suede
[00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:11.320]   Table stay I still have my original with it. I got a stainless steel original. Yeah watch. I still have the box
[00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:18.680]   Yeah, that's also be testing this Apple watch ultra in the hurricane. That's actually headed my way. Oh, where are you right now?
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:25.760]   my word I am near Tampa, Florida. Oh Tampa's gonna be the first time in 100 years Tampa's had a hurricane a
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:27.960]   Joking retweeted
[00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:34.120]   I tweeted last week when I got it jokingly. I get to test it in a hurricane and now I'm regretting that tweet because I think it will be a
[00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:41.000]   You didn't test. Yes, and I unfortunately I do have to say I'm about to lose power
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.960]   I did not plan for this that's okay if you lose power
[00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:50.840]   We'll wish you well and we'll think about you as Ian. So it's making it's made landfall. Is it is it stormy out?
[00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:57.800]   Well, I'm about to lose power because there's a generator being hooked up currently and I was told it wouldn't need to have the power off
[00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:01.400]   But it's going to and so when that kicks off. I'm not sure how long I'll be out
[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:03.960]   But I'll be reporting live from the hurricane floor
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:10.720]   And I want you know how to watch ultra does neck kind of environment Wow, this is exciting
[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:12.240]   Steven
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:16.400]   Can I make one request just for I mean this would be a generous gift for us
[00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:21.680]   But if you if the if the crew says oh by the way, we're gonna be shutting off power in about 30 seconds
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:23.440]   Could you just say oh my god?
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:24.880]   The winds are starting to pick up now
[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:29.600]   I don't know how so that you get caught up in mid-sentence because that would make a really great thumbnail for the video
[00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:33.040]   That would be I mean be great for the channel. I know it's not your channel, but I mean
[00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:37.200]   I'll say the back to you to cut it off now. I'll try to time it right
[00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:41.840]   And just reach just like give the camera a little bit shake and like say wow
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:47.280]   Wow
[00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:52.000]   I hope everything works out. Okay. That was rude to me. Thank you. We'll be all right. I'll be all right
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:57.520]   Yeah, so if the power goes out, we'll understand it when you disappear appreciate. Sorry about that. No, that's better
[00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:59.920]   Do you have family in Puerto Rico as well?
[00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:06.240]   Not anymore everything we all move to New York and then um, yeah, so so known no one's there now
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:13.040]   Yeah, because it's got hit very hard and yeah our thoughts and various as they say out to our friends in Puerto Rico
[00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:19.760]   Um, yeah, I was gonna try and fly my DJI mini two drone, but I don't think it's gonna withstand those hurricane force work
[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:22.800]   I think that's gonna work
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:25.840]   Yeah, mine doesn't even like a light breeze to be actually so
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:33.120]   I know you can't take it to the beach. No, yeah. Yeah, I know here's a tear down of the ultra
[00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:36.880]   We're in which you could see the giant the very giant
[00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:43.440]   Uh battery in it. This is at the I fix it folks who do such a great job with their tear downs
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:46.320]   Um, it one thing I did learn though though
[00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:50.560]   It has temptings that might be because there's pentelobe screws in the back very visible
[00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:56.960]   Uh, do not take your watch apart apparently it's not easy to put back together
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:00.080]   Unless you're a trained professional
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:03.040]   Do not
[00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:07.440]   Anyway, the kind of the bottom line reviews Steven on the uh ultra worth it
[00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:13.280]   Well, you know, I do like the bigger screen and I was always a titanium watch guy
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:17.280]   I liked the six and seven and titanium. I thought it showed less scratches plus
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:22.080]   I like the sapphire display and you don't get that option on the series eight anymore. So if you want tatin
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:23.680]   well
[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:26.000]   There it goes. Oh bye bye Steven
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.680]   Pleasure talking to you. Good luck in the hurricane
[00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:35.440]   Holy come only that's scary. That's terrifying. I heard his you. Yeah. I heard his ups
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:37.840]   Yeah, beep beep. There goes the power
[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:40.800]   Uh, okay. We're
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:42.800]   Watch show this show the wide shot
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:44.960]   The hurricane is what happens now is
[00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:46.960]   Percums in and removes you
[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:49.920]   Way
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:52.960]   Wait, he's back. Put him back. He's in the dark. I'll last
[00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:57.440]   I'll last as long as my APC runs on my max dude. I hear the beepin
[00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:00.000]   I hear the beepin
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   It's amazing
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   It's america
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:11.600]   We're gonna call him lazzarus roblis roblis from now on that's awesome. I I have the same ups when I heard that people like
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:16.960]   What's happening in my office? I know that be so if you're hearing it folks. It's not you. It's him
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:21.760]   Uh, anyway, uh, yeah final apple watch ultra review. I really like it
[00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:25.120]   You know, whether it's worth it if you're not an adventure is hard to say
[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:30.320]   Liking the material liking the bigger screen for accessibility if you like making super large text
[00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:33.600]   Sorry about the beeping that might be a worthwhile feature
[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:36.960]   But uh, I don't know I remains to be seen i'm going to use it for the next few weeks
[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:40.480]   Without my series seven just strictly ultra and we'll see how it goes
[00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:45.120]   Uh turn on the flashlight on the watch and then that way you can just use the light
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:47.840]   You're like your beard the beard will stay on beyond
[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:51.040]   That's not that bright
[00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:54.960]   You have to keep twisting your wrist
[00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:57.840]   I
[00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:05.360]   Know that by his apple watch in the midst of hurricane Ian
[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:09.040]   Direct from tampa. It's beer good dot fm
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:11.680]   He was he was gonna be like camera as well
[00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:15.840]   I think it's gonna be like for the next apple keynote where they you know
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:20.480]   But thank god that I had my apple watch was able to light me during my live stream if
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:24.000]   I just don't want to think about what would have happened if I had not had my apple
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.680]   That's hysterical if I do my apple watch in my iphone. I can kind of you really you're well
[00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:32.800]   Well, you're well. You're probably the brightest thing in tampa. You need you need ipad for your learning. That's great
[00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:35.360]   Point out. We should point out
[00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:40.800]   It's not even raining in tampa yet. This is because they are converting your power to a generator
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:46.480]   Uh at this time so that you'll be ready when the hurricane hits, but you are actually not yet in a storm
[00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:53.920]   That's right and I think the ua pc will probably last for 10 whole minutes. So that's good. Sorry again for the the short short
[00:20:53.920 --> 00:21:00.000]   Visit but thank you again for this to me. This is the apple watch. I've always wanted. I mean I
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.360]   You know, I was very skeptical of the first apple watch. I thought that you know, it's just an accessory to your
[00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:12.160]   Phone it's not doesn't and then apple slowly added features. It made it more enticing for me like the activity tracking and
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:14.000]   uh and
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:19.920]   By now this thing is a phone. I mean it really is a phone. I can go out with it. Listen to music
[00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:24.480]   I can make phone calls. I can I mean I could do all that before I guess but with that big screen
[00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:27.040]   I just feel like it's it's got some real utility
[00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:30.640]   Um and I can always find out what longitude and latitude i'm at
[00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:36.080]   The compass is great. You know, you can see you have you set up the action button for anything yet leo
[00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:41.040]   Uh, yeah use it for a stopwatch. Uh, it's limited what you can set it for right uh steve
[00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:44.960]   Yeah, I will say oh go ahead rosemary. You can do this morning. Yeah. Yeah. Go ahead talk
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:50.640]   Um she set up a really cool thing where she created a shortcut because of course you can trigger a shortcut
[00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:55.840]   She did one where it is contextually aware so the shortcut when you hit that button it says
[00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:59.440]   If i'm in my focus mode in this specific focus mode do this
[00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:06.640]   Otherwise do this or do this or do that and so instead of the button just being like turn on something or turn off something or activate something
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:11.280]   Because it can be contextually aware. She's got a whole bunch of different things that can run
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:17.200]   And so I was thinking oh it'd be so nice. I've got an action button say and I press that button
[00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:22.240]   And it knows that I met my uh in my office and so it turns on my lights
[00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:25.760]   It turns on do not disturb it goes ahead and runs everything for me
[00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:31.040]   But if i'm uh driving and I hit the button then that could be used to do something else
[00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:35.760]   So yeah, you can get really powerful with that action button whenever you use contextual shortcuts
[00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:41.920]   It also has a shortcuts complication now. So I think start it's time to start writing shortcuts for the apple watch
[00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:46.080]   Uh, absolutely. Yeah, I'll have to think of what I could do with it. That's really interesting
[00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:50.400]   Yeah, I've haven't tried a shortcut yet, but I did program it for a swimming workout
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:54.480]   Which is helpful because once you're in the water it is difficult to use the touch screen
[00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:56.800]   And it will actually lock often
[00:22:56.800 --> 00:23:02.080]   Uh where you can't interact with it. So being able to hit that button and start a swimming workout without touching the screen
[00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:08.880]   Is really beneficial. Um, I will say I think this change with watchOS 9 to eject the water now from an apple watch
[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:11.680]   You used to be able to just roll the digital crown
[00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:17.680]   It would kind of would spin to do the sound and that's it and now you actually have to hold the digital crown and it feels like a slower process
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:21.760]   So i'm not crazy about that. That was actually a watchOS 9 change not so much a hardware
[00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:27.520]   Ultra, you know from series 7 ultra, but uh an action button for swimming two thumbs up definitely like that
[00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:30.880]   So uh workout stopwatch waypoint
[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:33.440]   Backtrack
[00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:36.160]   Dive flashlight or shortcut
[00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:43.600]   Uh, I like shortcut. I mean rather I like flashlight at a moment's notice because yeah use that on my apple watch quite a bit
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:45.680]   The red one in particular because at night
[00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:52.160]   Uh red light doesn't travel as far and the waves by oh, that's another nice feature by the way of the
[00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:55.680]   I think it's only of the uh, uh, uh, where what is it?
[00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:57.120]   Oh, yeah, you've got that special
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:01.520]   I can make it red at night, which is good if i'm wearing it at night and it doesn't bother your eyes
[00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:06.880]   Astronomy mode too, right? That's the the color you're supposed to use if you're doing an astronomy at night
[00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:11.840]   Doesn't somehow bother your eyes. So yeah, I like that feature a lot. I'm
[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:14.640]   I'm very happy now. I played the siren
[00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:23.600]   On uh on sundays let me play it for you now because it's a it's a little weird so press and hold the action button to activate siren
[00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:31.280]   Okay, and then i'm gonna press that by the way, that's another nice feature you could press and hold it medical id compass backtrack emergency call
[00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:38.800]   And siren all pop up. Let me turn on the siren folks. This is just a test. This is only a test
[00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:43.440]   Stop that loud
[00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:47.440]   It's really more uh for finding you like you're you're falling under a bush
[00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:51.200]   And they can use echolocation to find you I guess
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:57.440]   Yeah, they made it clear that the the way that it's created the frequencies are good for traveling across
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:03.760]   distances, so however they've designed it it can do a better job of being heard at a distance. Yeah
[00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:09.760]   It's not it's it's not that loud. It's not piercingly loud, which is probably a good thing
[00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:14.800]   Uh, but still maybe we should we should have warned people listening on head. Okay pick up
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:18.800]   Although to take off their headphones before you yeah burt came running in well
[00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:22.720]   He didn't really come running and he kind of lounged in are you okay? You all right?
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:25.280]   Is everything all right everything? I work it. Yeah, I'm fine
[00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:28.560]   Yes, thank you, uh, Andy
[00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:32.640]   I should have said that beforehand shouldn't I was it that loud though? I'm wearing headphones. It didn't
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:34.240]   Well, I wasn't too bad for me, but yeah
[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:38.960]   People do those boosters that they turn on on their in their podcasts. So there's a chance
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:43.440]   Sorry, hope I haven't deafened our audience
[00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:47.600]   Um, so you can tie the shortcut to your focus modes
[00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:53.760]   But what you need is like, uh, hurricane focus mode so you could set it to flashlight you need you need us some
[00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:55.760]   How
[00:25:55.760 --> 00:26:03.200]   Get super contextual with it. Yeah, it's getting super contextual only when a hurricane is directly overhead, right? And it read that focus
[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:04.320]   Right
[00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:07.200]   I feel like this is a super watch. I mean, I'm really kind of
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:14.160]   Kind of excited. I mean, I feel like I there's like stuff in here that I don't know like that shortcut thing
[00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:18.640]   That's cool. I think that what what I learned this morning is that
[00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:24.240]   If you if you were excited enough about this watch it doesn't matter how it looks because rosemary
[00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:27.200]   She's trying wearing one this morning. She's trying to look okay, huh?
[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:33.600]   And it looked okay on her wrist. She's like it is big obviously bigger than but she didn't care because now she has that action
[00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:37.760]   But now she has these extra features. She's gonna be able to use of those. Yeah, and so it's worth it. Yeah
[00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:41.200]   Um to give you an idea of the size lisa came up with this
[00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:44.320]   It's like strapping an apple ipod nano to your wrist
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:50.400]   I used to do that some people did and it's about that roughly that size, right?
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:53.440]   Yeah, but I also I just like the look of it
[00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:59.760]   You know just for when I see my series seven now or the series six it looks not not plain
[00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:02.880]   But I mean it's kind of very smooth edges a very particular design
[00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:07.200]   I actually like this kind of hardware and it feels substantial
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:11.760]   And so even if I'm not you know ice climbing or whatever it's I like it. I like looking down at it
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:18.880]   I uh, I put my series six uh to rest this morning in its little uh rubber mac and tush holder
[00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:24.240]   I went to settings. I said reset forget everything you ever knew
[00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:30.800]   And this slid it into soon soon you'll be at peace. I was just beginning to feel
[00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:32.480]   uh
[00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:39.200]   Daisy daisy you're not gonna live the two watch lifestyle like sleeping with one watch and then wearing another one during the day
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:41.280]   He actually wears one around his name at all
[00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:47.280]   No, I would it but this goes so long. I don't have to it's kind of kind of cool
[00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:52.720]   And you're right it feels like when you the ancient say this out loud when you have the old watch. It's like
[00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:56.000]   What is this a model t this feels so
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:02.160]   It feels dainty in comparison. Yeah. Yeah. What is the name of that rubber?
[00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:04.160]   I'm I'm a I'm a I'm a
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:06.880]   I'm a oh is that a logo?
[00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:13.200]   Yeah, thank you. Well, you got a good you young people have such good memories. It's my uh, what's that called ginkgo below?
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:18.080]   Are you taking that is it made of is it made out of octopus shells?
[00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:19.760]   Yeah
[00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:22.080]   Yeah, um, case it was have shells. We know
[00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:27.440]   Here it is. So this is it's actually really cool. I we do recommend this is a really cool
[00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:32.160]   The idea is like it's an old class mac classic, but it's got a watch charger in it
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:36.640]   You have to provide it and then you slide your watch into it. So I took the band off
[00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:43.200]   I reset it and I slid it into its little rubber mac the reason I did is this watch is too huge
[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:46.160]   You could stuff it in there, but it really bulges
[00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:49.440]   It will charge, but it really bulges. So
[00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:56.560]   Maybe El go Elo go has to make a new bigger one for the Oh, they need they they need to either make like a Mack two
[00:28:56.560 --> 00:29:02.920]   A version of effects for sure. Yeah, yeah or or they should or they should do like when they read when they
[00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:08.560]   Would apple like rehab refad the Apple Lisa and Lisa Mac Excel. They should make a rubber version of a Lisa Mac Okay?
[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:10.200]   Oh
[00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:16.600]   Elago. I hope you're listening. I would be those ideas for free. I love your stuff. Yeah, give me a free one and you can have that idea
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:21.100]   Is this it works with all the charges like I had the I have the
[00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:27.500]   extra capacity battery a magsafe thing and I put it on that it goes and it's great
[00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:34.040]   That's a good. That's actually how I charge it where I've been no mad stand up a charger and it goes right on that and
[00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:40.480]   Like it even works with the magsafe duo which that was some concern because the puck to charge is so close to the surface
[00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:43.240]   But it works on magsafe do charges just fine. Okay. Yeah
[00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:46.440]   Well, that's our Apple watch ultra segment
[00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:53.200]   Now let's talk about these because you got yours Mike and I got mine. This is the new
[00:29:53.200 --> 00:30:00.840]   Air pod pro 2 second generation and you can tell because we have lanyards hanging off exactly
[00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:06.040]   Yeah, oh you did the custom. Oh, yeah, I want to mine sooner. Steven has one - same
[00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:10.920]   And the engraving shows up on the iPhone screen when you pair it which is really nice. Oh what?
[00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:13.760]   What?
[00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:17.080]   I thought I wanted to get it faster. I didn't want to gram
[00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:25.240]   That's actually that's actually a more not just a cute feature. That's important because it's it's testimony to how badly
[00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:30.680]   It's like smart pairing works that you just get all of these notifications. Hey these air pods are within range
[00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:34.840]   You want to pair with them now, you know exactly which one trying to pair with it. I'm not trying to pair it. Yeah
[00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:41.840]   So I you know I I have always thought the Air pods and the pros were overpriced
[00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:44.280]   underperforming
[00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:47.040]   Look at that studio display is refusing to focus on the
[00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:50.600]   No, no, we want your face even we want your face
[00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:54.960]   Graping yeah, yeah, it is cool. Wow
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:59.080]   That's pretty nice. Yeah, if you get it engraved in person like
[00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:02.000]   Someone got at the fifth Avenue Apple store
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:07.360]   We can get engravings in person if you do that it won't show the engraving right in the card
[00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:12.080]   Right, right if you order online it has to program the magnet they have an engraver there at the
[00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:16.440]   Fit that Avenue Apple okay, it's a little stretch calling graving. They're not actually
[00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:24.280]   Inkjet printing laser edge is it etched really does your texture on it? No, no, it's not it's like a print
[00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:28.920]   You know, it's it's actually why are they they have a special Air pods for a string inkjet
[00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:35.360]   I think it goes. Oh, I see because I've got a laser printer. So this is laser. Okay. Yeah, they call it laser I
[00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:41.440]   Don't remember now. I think you added the laser. I may have added the laser in my mind. Yeah
[00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:47.840]   It's so what do we think Micah? Do you ask you first this time? What do you like? What do you think about the Air pods?
[00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:53.960]   Broke to so everything so far the fact that there's a speaker on the
[00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:58.560]   Case itself. I quite like that it's I think some people will be annoyed by it
[00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:03.560]   But I quite like that I get a little chime to let me know that it's charging on a wireless charger in particular
[00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:08.440]   Of course these now can be charged with an Apple Watch puck even an Apple Watch puck even
[00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:12.920]   Even a watch book and so I like that but
[00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:16.840]   The the chime reminds me. Oh, yeah
[00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:23.160]   I can use find my and actually here my AirPods Pro if they're lost somewhere, which is very cool
[00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:32.160]   What kind of surprised me and made me think about sort of the the history of AirPods is if you look at older AirPods
[00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:38.280]   they the grill is the grill that's kind of built into the
[00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:46.920]   inner part of the ear on previous AirPods was on the part that actually almost touches against the inside of your ear
[00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:55.400]   Apple is in these new ones moved it to the top of the AirPod and so it's just it has me curious about kind of what
[00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:58.040]   Change that made overall in terms of how
[00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:02.600]   They've improved on the active noise cancellation and everything involved with air
[00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:08.200]   But I got to tell you and then I am curious to hear more from you because you've you've got lots of different headphones and earbuds and
[00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:13.400]   Not I have them all the thing that has me most excited and I actually did let out a little
[00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:21.080]   Sound in the Steve Jobs theater whenever they announced this because this is the one thing I cared about was that you can swipe up or down to control the volume
[00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:26.680]   Finally, yes, I never knew that that it wasn't a feature
[00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:32.440]   See I always thought these are really overpriced you can get very very good
[00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:37.880]   Quality sound from say the Samsung Galaxy buds for a lot like half the price
[00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:43.720]   But I have to say I'm kind of liking these the adaptive noise cancellation is interesting
[00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:48.280]   Uh because if you turn that on you could still hear people talking to you and stuff
[00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:52.840]   But it and it and if it's a if it's a jackhammer as they showed at the event
[00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:58.360]   Uh, it'll it's a hypersensitive to that. It seems to work these seem to work pretty pretty well
[00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:04.680]   So much so that I've now hanging them from my neck at all times. It's a badge of of honor
[00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:11.720]   Um now how about the problem that we've all reported which is that they've been insensitive to if you have other
[00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:16.680]   Apple devices switching over in the middle of a phone call and yeah, I turned that
[00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:24.200]   You've got a turn I I recommend turning that off. Um, so this is a feature where you can switch between uh two options
[00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:28.600]   There's uh automatically here. Let me find it so that I'm saying it correctly
[00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:35.080]   Um connect to this iPhone or connect to this Mac or connect to this iPad and there's an option between automatically or
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:43.240]   Last connected to this iPhone I turn on when last connected to this blink on everything because then I'm in charge
[00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:45.400]   Listen, I am the captain now airpods too
[00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:52.040]   I get to choose when I connect to whatever device because yes, I don't I don't like the way that
[00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:56.680]   Apple has made some adjustments to it. It's gotten a little bit better, but not enough
[00:34:56.680 --> 00:35:00.920]   Um in fact earlier today luckily it was after I was done with iOS today
[00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:05.560]   Um it tried to connect this is an iPhone that is my camera here
[00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:06.680]   And
[00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:11.800]   Airpods tried to connect to that and it actually causes the camera to pause and as I said it was between shows
[00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:16.360]   So it wasn't a big deal, but if that happened during a show, that's kind of annoying. So I don't like that feature. Yeah
[00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:17.800]   Um
[00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:21.800]   It happened several times before this call because I'm using my Airpods pro 2 right now
[00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:27.240]   And anytime I moved like my iPad or my iPhone they would switch so quickly. It's pretty annoying
[00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:30.920]   So where do we change that? I didn't even know that was a setting
[00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:36.840]   Like uh, so if you're on your iPhone, then you launch the settings app and now in iOS 16
[00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:42.360]   You'll see up at the top right below family. Yeah is a new section that says your airpods
[00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:46.520]   Yeah, isn't I my max has showed up there too, which is kind of cool. Yeah
[00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:51.400]   So you click into that and then I'm trying to get it to show up on mine. I have it up over here
[00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:54.520]   Okay, so you have noise cancellation transparency
[00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:56.120]   Model
[00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:57.080]   Scrolling
[00:35:57.080 --> 00:36:02.040]   Connect to this phone. Oh here it is right at the top there it is connect this phone automatically when last connected
[00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:07.480]   Wait a minute choose how airpods connect to this phone airpods pro can always automatically connect to this phone
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:14.920]   Or only connect if this phone was the last device you used with them in other words. It's sticky. It stays phone
[00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:19.880]   Uh until you intentionally go to another device
[00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:27.160]   That is correct and you would want to do that on any device you use them with. Yeah, yeah, otherwise other ones might try to grab it away
[00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:31.320]   Uh because unfortunately apple sets it to automatically by default
[00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:37.640]   And that is not the fun behavior in my humble opinion. So there are also some new features on this
[00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:40.200]   one of them steven you can describe
[00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:46.680]   Is to test the tips they come with the medium tips, but there's also a small extra small
[00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:50.040]   Small and large. Did you do the one?
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.160]   Yeah, that's the you can test the ear tip fit which you could do actually with the previous models
[00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:57.720]   Um, and it will check the seal around it
[00:36:57.720 --> 00:37:00.920]   But what's new actually is the personalized spatial audio
[00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:05.960]   Which you can do with it without the airpods pro to in hand a picture will scare your ear
[00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:11.800]   With the true depth sensor and create a personalized spatial audio experience that way
[00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:15.160]   I haven't been able to tell really if it makes a big difference
[00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:19.960]   But I will say the airpods pro to the noise cancellation and transparency
[00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:23.160]   I do think it's noticeably improved from the first generation
[00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:30.600]   Especially transparency mode. I mean it you know feel like I don't have anything in my ears a lot of times when that transparency mode is on
[00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:33.400]   That's vastly improving. Yes, this is they're really a long
[00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:37.960]   Way toward an over-the-counter hearing aid to be honest with you
[00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:45.080]   Um, the quality is really good. So I did the you know, so I didn't realize this previously
[00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:47.320]   So I put them in it plays music
[00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:52.520]   And then it and it worked it said no, no your left ear is way too loose. So I pushed it in and uh
[00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:54.680]   Try a bigger
[00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:59.560]   Didn't say bigger, but so try another tip. So I tried the large tip and then it went. Oh, that's good
[00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:03.400]   I guess no leakage at all. It's true. Those were the right tips for me
[00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:08.600]   Um, so that's a good feature and then but it is a little hard to do the ear scan because
[00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:11.000]   You can't look at the phone it's awkward
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:16.200]   So I had to get a mirror and hold the mirror up so I could see what was on the phone
[00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:20.520]   So if it was seeing my ear and then if it's too close, it says it stops and you have to go
[00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:24.120]   Okay, and if it's too far it stopped so you have to get between 10 and 20 inches
[00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:28.520]   Right looking nice at your ear and then you slightly tip your head back and forward
[00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:35.000]   It took me a while works. Yeah. Well, and then that's the thing is do you notice the difference? I don't know I can
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:41.640]   I do think the tips are improved in their material because the first AirPods Pro would fall out of my ears sometimes
[00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:46.120]   And I actually got the comply foam ear tips that are like ear plug material
[00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:49.160]   Right and those really kept them in but with the AirPods Pro 2
[00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:53.400]   I've been just using the tips they come with and it actually grabs my inner ear canal
[00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:56.680]   I think better even so much as when I like pull them out of my ear
[00:38:56.680 --> 00:39:02.040]   They can almost like go inside out as I kind of as they come out. Yeah, then it makes it. It's a great seal
[00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:05.800]   Yeah, I'm very happy. I'm surprised how good these sound to be honest
[00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:08.440]   That's a question I wanted to ask mica when he was talking about the new
[00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:15.160]   You know being able to uh be use a touch command since and swiping using swipe commands to change the volume
[00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:17.160]   Do they stay in your ears when you do that?
[00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:19.800]   Uh, yeah, so I was curious about
[00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:26.520]   When I heard I did not yeah didn't move them around since they're so lightweight, but what I what's not clear to me
[00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:28.200]   Um
[00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:33.000]   I I haven't tried it without doing this, but if you look on the uh apple.com
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.160]   Slash AirPods hyphen pro page when they show that section
[00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:40.680]   Um, they use little green circles to represent like the movement, right?
[00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:46.440]   And on the back of the air pod stem you can see a green circle meaning that
[00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:52.280]   And this is the way i've done it you're meant to support it while you you see you put one finger on the back and then you rocket
[00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:56.360]   I have not tried kind of just going and putting my finger on the front and tried to move
[00:39:56.360 --> 00:40:01.560]   This is a very natural. This is kind of what you're gonna end up wanting to do grabbing it
[00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:05.000]   It'll just grab it and then your your index finger goes up and down
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:10.120]   You also will be grabbing it to change the transparency mode to to next
[00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:16.520]   Next to track. There's you know, there's a whole bunch of things and it gives you a nice little quick. Yes, sir. How do
[00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:20.760]   Oh, my man somebody's talking to me
[00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:28.120]   Uh, how do I do how do I do the schlomo? Do I
[00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:34.600]   You just say hey, you know who hey schlomo and it'll work. Yeah, you don't have to you don't have to press any buttons or anything
[00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:41.720]   No, it's nice. It's good. I'm I'm excited. I think these are these are pretty good and uh since I can drive them with my
[00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:44.760]   ginormous watch
[00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:49.880]   I think for for working out. This is gonna be a really great pair. You know leave your phone at home
[00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:55.800]   And I gotta say I love that lanyard loop on the side. Yeah, so yeah nice a lot of people in fact
[00:40:55.800 --> 00:41:00.120]   My old airpods probably ordered a case, you know a 12 south case that had a lanyard connection
[00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:03.240]   But yeah, this is nice. Are you worried about it getting banged up a little bit?
[00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:06.360]   Yeah, I I am a little bit
[00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:10.360]   I heard a case that makes this lanyard actually does also make a case
[00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:15.240]   But I'm waiting for nomad because I that's what I used to write. I used to have the nomad that was beautiful
[00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:19.800]   Yeah, sponsor on the network. Of course. We should mention but yeah, they that's what I used to use for my airpods
[00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:24.760]   So I'm waiting for them to come out with one that just supports the built-in lanyard loop. Do you need a different case?
[00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:29.880]   I've only tried choose from the old pros
[00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:33.560]   Well, so there's no speaker holes at the bottom of the case
[00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:38.440]   So you would not get as good as a fine my and I think outside of that though
[00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:42.280]   It should be the same. Let me try putting it on here and see what happens
[00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:46.840]   This is also say none. Apple's added the u1 chip to the airpods pro case
[00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:49.560]   Please add it to the apple tv remote and also maybe
[00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:52.520]   Thank you
[00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:56.360]   That's a whole thank you. I actually have a rubber case for my
[00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:59.320]   Apple tv remote that has a lanyard on it
[00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:04.680]   It does make it with an air tag inside. Yeah, it's a silicone
[00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:11.560]   Yeah, this is the fact that this is essentially an air tag now is great. You know, it won't be hard to find these right?
[00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:15.960]   Yeah, unless you have well, maybe I will get into your wall was
[00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:18.600]   Who not got an ongoing issue
[00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:19.640]   with
[00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:25.080]   With fine my where because of a something happened and the database side of things
[00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:31.640]   Fine my just does not work on my iCloud account. Oh and I have this ongoing support issue, but that's you
[00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:35.640]   Uh, that's just exactly that's just a me thing. So that's what I was saying. Yeah, um
[00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:40.760]   So that's the new in case on the new one and yeah, if it's just fine. So you technically use this okay good
[00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:45.880]   You don't have to drill out holes for this. Yeah, so find my speakers at the bottom
[00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:50.760]   Yeah, and you said you're looking for a case that has that let that's a pass through for the lanyard built into the uh
[00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:55.480]   Yeah, so I guess instead it would just kind of have a little you know oval on the side
[00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:57.640]   Yeah, yeah, yeah
[00:42:57.640 --> 00:42:59.000]   Um
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:03.400]   I might just customize this case though now that I think about I've got a drum all I can make some little holes for the speakers
[00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:05.480]   But do you have a laser engraver?
[00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:11.320]   Oh, by the way, yes, the word on the site is there's no laser mentioned anywhere. It's just engrave
[00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:14.920]   But yeah, doesn't grave not engrave implies into yes
[00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:19.720]   Not not make a raised area. That's emboss or something else. I don't know
[00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:23.160]   Well, it's not even raised though. It's just kind of like printed on
[00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:29.160]   Just like the made in california, you know designing california made in china thing on the back
[00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:34.040]   It's so if I run my finger across that I can feel it my nail across that on the back
[00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:40.120]   I can feel a slight difference in the material. Yeah, I was gonna say that if sorry if they're using if they're using a chemical process
[00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:44.440]   That actually melts a layer of plastic gray plastic into the plastic. That could be a
[00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:47.640]   Okay, I could get down with that
[00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:51.320]   Yeah
[00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:53.640]   Um, I was trying to see if I could find some uh
[00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:57.640]   Some video of how this works, but I don't
[00:43:57.640 --> 00:44:03.800]   Oh, yeah, here it is. Here it is. This is the machine that apple uses to print onto
[00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:06.520]   uh, oh
[00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:09.800]   No, it's not
[00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:15.160]   Okay, what is this? This is you know, this is how this is how plates ceramic plates are apprended
[00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:17.960]   Yeah, they have a little rubber
[00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:25.320]   Thing that they dip in the ink and then it paints right onto the plate goes full shape stamp. Yeah. Yeah
[00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:28.120]   Anyway, come on coincidentally
[00:44:28.120 --> 00:44:32.040]   I wouldn't be surprised if that's exactly though how they do this right that they have a
[00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:35.160]   That apple would design some box it goes into and it goes
[00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:37.320]   Yeah, of course
[00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:43.240]   But it just it just goes to show how weird this category is no matter who's making it that it doesn't matter how
[00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:48.440]   If you can be up there up there on stage with here's like histograms or how good the audio is and here's how
[00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:54.280]   Advanced mind technology is for making sure that it's it's doing adaptive net noise cancellation
[00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:57.400]   Here's all the other features we're doing in to cook the software to make
[00:44:57.400 --> 00:45:02.440]   Make a human speech easier to comprehend if the thing doesn't stay in your ear
[00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:09.400]   It's a bat. It's it's a fail and that's a fail for an individual person who decides that well, I g I try to pair of air
[00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:13.160]   Of air pods once they kept falling on my ears. I couldn't stand. I'm a bought a pair of soneys
[00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:18.120]   They work just fine and has nothing to do with the technology has to do with how did how this person decided to shape their ears
[00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:20.360]   and things like and for me things like
[00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:25.960]   uh having uh having a touch commands on the earbud it's actually kind of a negative because
[00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:31.880]   naturally over the course if I'm wearing earbuds sometimes for like two or three hours at a time when I'm out and about and
[00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:37.960]   Naturally, they just kind of work themselves loose and it's kind of a bummer when I can't just simply give them a little extra shove in
[00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:43.880]   Without like suddenly suddenly activating the the virtual assistant or suddenly like changing tracks like no
[00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:47.400]   I'm sorry. I just I just wanted to sort of shove it into my earhole a little bit more
[00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:51.160]   Please ignore this as a command. So it's it's a weird very weird category
[00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:57.880]   And it's it's this is why it's I think it's kind of a scramble where apple is absolutely competing with every other maker of these things to
[00:45:57.880 --> 00:46:02.280]   For for for brand loyalty at this point. Well, we rehearsed his funeral
[00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:07.000]   A few minutes ago, but now it's official the bearded teacher has no longer with us
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:11.640]   It's got you know, it's lucky. He got to hear us say all the nice things about him
[00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:14.120]   uh, but yeah his power is
[00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:15.160]   is
[00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:16.120]   kind of
[00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:21.720]   Can I say that that that was a very very generous act and his part where it's like you knowing that you have 20 minutes
[00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:27.080]   But to shut to shut down things to send final emails. Oh, by the way, I'm going to be out of power for a little bit of while
[00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:27.320]   I'm out
[00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:32.840]   I might be off the grid and he decided to like burn all that power to talk to us and talk to the listeners and the viewers
[00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:37.000]   That was a very very generous and finally his his studio just went
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:41.960]   The bearded teacher is at beard dot fm
[00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:48.120]   Thank you, steven roblis for being here as long as you could be and it's at which great actually to get his reviews
[00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:53.800]   He's also at apple insider dot com of both the new airpods pro to and the apple watch
[00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:56.040]   ultra
[00:46:56.040 --> 00:47:00.600]   Especially so who had all the heart I don't I don't have either of these pieces of hard room and talking about so yeah, it was
[00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:05.960]   Yeah, it was like it was he was a very very valuable addition to furthermore our chatroom has done
[00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:08.680]   some research
[00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:17.240]   And from white dog engraving comes this information. How does apple engraving work apple devices are engraved using high powered laser engravers?
[00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:23.720]   Lasers the apple pencil the ipod the ipod touch and the airpods are all
[00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:26.680]   engraved that way
[00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:28.440]   uh
[00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:29.720]   so
[00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:36.360]   So maybe like when it's burning it it does cause a slight bubble which is why it feels raised against the surface and that's why
[00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:42.680]   I'm saying it feels that way it is plastic, right? So it's just heating it would probably do something. This is what
[00:47:42.680 --> 00:47:47.160]   Yeah, change the color. Right. Yeah, so it's it's more like a cutter
[00:47:47.160 --> 00:47:53.320]   Than an engraver a heater, you know than an engraver. So almost like a wood what are those wood
[00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:57.560]   uh burners yeah, yeah, pretty much like that. Yeah, like a
[00:47:57.560 --> 00:48:01.560]   Glow fortune. Yeah, I think but it's it's good that that's actually legit because
[00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:05.480]   uh you the when you say engraving or embossing the
[00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:11.400]   The implication is that it doesn't matter how much this how much this thing gets rubbed on it's not going to come off
[00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:15.240]   Because it is because sometimes you get burned by that when you see oh look
[00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:20.200]   I had my name put on this things and then eight months later like half the letters are gone because it really is just a
[00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:28.280]   Flight to the surface. So yeah, you can I think you can count on apple to want to make sure that if they decide to go for personalization that your personalization
[00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:32.440]   Absolutely sticks. I'm kind of that's a cell phone. I'm kind of bummed though
[00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:36.760]   Uh, and I know you are too mica a we would have been able to still able to get them
[00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:40.040]   And be I love it that the it's more than engraving
[00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:46.760]   It's somehow burnt into the memory of the little case and and the fact that it shows up on the phone too
[00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:51.400]   That's just kind of neat. Oh now apple supports you can use your own
[00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:57.800]   Memoji as one of the engraving options. So not just emoji. I might have to buy a whole nother set of these
[00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:02.520]   Take them back. Get it get a hold back apple. Yeah, or they can be
[00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:07.640]   You could you give that to someone for for Christmas or your family members for christmas. Yeah, you just get one with you
[00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:15.560]   Throughout the tips though. Oh, man. Oh, well, why did you do that? Well, I'm thinking am I ever going to change my ear size?
[00:49:15.560 --> 00:49:16.760]   No
[00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:20.840]   So what do I need these for if you ever get stung by a beat god forbid
[00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:23.640]   What are you gonna do? Oh my god?
[00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:27.560]   Your kids all roll up and then I don't have the still need to listen to your music and I
[00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:35.800]   See mma get one of those cauliflower your deals. Uh, yeah, exactly. Would I start boxing? Yeah
[00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:41.800]   Well, I'll remember to wear protection when I do from now on steven. We wish you well. I hope everybody in Tampa
[00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:46.040]   It's does well. Uh, he hurricane earring Ian is on the way and
[00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:48.760]   yikes yikes yikes yikes. Uh
[00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:53.480]   Now our rj dj 2000 in our charam says
[00:49:53.480 --> 00:50:00.120]   Lio bor likely it's a fiber laser. They're using a small 30 watt machine could do it quite nicely and way faster
[00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:03.720]   Than a sea fiber laser. It's a fiber
[00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:12.520]   Fiber laser does it burn fiber on to i i met no i met i would imagine that it's kind of like a dot matrix printer only except for
[00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:16.040]   I speak is being is being come basically have a bundle of fibers
[00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:21.240]   In the in the shape of a matrix and that you're firing individual dots of them to create that image
[00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:24.040]   they're widely used in industry because of the
[00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:26.680]   variety of
[00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:28.840]   temperatures and frequencies
[00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:33.160]   They can they can do so burn through the device into the
[00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:40.840]   Electronics. Well, yeah, it's exactly, you know, they they set them up to do exactly what they need to do for that particular thing
[00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:42.760]   So that's cool. All right. Thank you for that
[00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:46.120]   rj dj 2000 if
[00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:51.000]   Wait a way to revive the image writer brand that could call like the the image writer laser burner
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.080]   I love one of those. That'd be so cool
[00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:56.120]   Do you think apple offers those on its repair replace program?
[00:50:56.120 --> 00:51:00.200]   I know but they do say as steven mentioned you can go to the fifth avenue store and they'll
[00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:03.960]   Engrave it as you wait, but you won't get that special programming
[00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:11.720]   Oh, no, I don't want to get the fiber laser that the apple uses i feel like i've got i've got a broken one like it's not as
[00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:13.800]   I know it's not full. It's not
[00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:15.640]   It's not true
[00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:17.080]   And again
[00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:21.320]   Because apple is really promoting fine. My is not just a oh by the way
[00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:23.400]   Just like every just like every other phone manufacturers
[00:51:23.400 --> 00:51:26.920]   There's some sort of a dingus in here that will make it be remotely if you lost your phone
[00:51:26.920 --> 00:51:30.200]   They're made they're basically turning in turning fine money to a whole platform
[00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:33.560]   So the idea of making fine. My not just the name of the product
[00:51:33.560 --> 00:51:36.920]   But also here's here's a visual identifier for what this thing looks like
[00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:42.680]   It's when it's when it's working correctly. It's a good boon when as often happens
[00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:48.760]   It's not working correctly and again. I'm on i'm on the commuter real train and my ipad keeps saying hey
[00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:54.120]   Hey, I found a new I found a pair of air pods nearby. Do you want to pair them and i say i don't own a pair of air pods
[00:51:54.120 --> 00:52:00.040]   So please no never yeah, that's it's you can see you can see you can see like even if inside your household
[00:52:00.040 --> 00:52:03.880]   If you know that hey, yeah, this is this actually my my spouse's air pods
[00:52:03.960 --> 00:52:10.360]   I don't want those paired because she is actually like two floors down applying polyurethane to to a carpentry project
[00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:12.600]   I don't think that she needs to hear
[00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:16.040]   Uh, my my here my live stream of whatever I'm doing. I'm wearing it
[00:52:16.040 --> 00:52:21.800]   You've been hanging out in the loport household a lot. I can get a fiber laser for a mere three thousand dollars
[00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:25.320]   So amazon right so I can just make my own but you can't
[00:52:25.320 --> 00:52:32.680]   I've been the idea in here. That's the magic. That is the magic. That is what I what
[00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:35.000]   See mike, meanwhile
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:41.800]   I've been thinking about you know what this image writer idea is not such a bad idea because you can obviously like you're not going to be using the print
[00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:47.960]   Carter so you can actually build a cartridge that has its own lipobattery and it has its own like laser like generator at the head
[00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:51.240]   So that is actually you're actually using the existing
[00:52:51.240 --> 00:52:57.240]   carriage and movement concern to actually to actually fire off that laser that's this is this is
[00:52:57.240 --> 00:53:03.480]   I need to I need to start working on a kickstarter proposal because I bet I could I could raise a couple hundred thousand
[00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:06.280]   Dollars for a product that I'm never ever ever going to be able to ship
[00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:13.080]   So I I think we we can safely say there were at least three pairs of thumbs up for
[00:53:13.080 --> 00:53:14.440]   the
[00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:19.160]   Ultra two pairs of thumbs up for the ultra means Stephen and three pairs of thumbs up for the earpud
[00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:22.440]   Pro two apples come up with two very nice products
[00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:27.480]   Uh, and actually I'm very happy as long as we're talking with the uh, the 14 pro max
[00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:32.520]   It's been it's been uh, I love the always on mode. I have to say even more than dynamic island
[00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:35.400]   That's it. That's a game. Tell me tell me more about that
[00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:40.440]   The reason I ask is because I've seen it go uh two ways and I'm kind of in the second camp
[00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:43.720]   Where I don't know if it's just my anxiety brain or whatever
[00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:49.880]   But every time I look at my phone and see that it's on I want to reach and hit that side button and make it go dark
[00:53:49.880 --> 00:53:51.880]   And then of course it goes bright instead
[00:53:51.880 --> 00:53:59.960]   I'm like no way to reprogram yourself. Yeah, I've got to reprogram myself and I I guess I'm always like I I'm being
[00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:03.720]   Considered of battery life, but it hasn't been an issue and so again
[00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:05.240]   It's all just retraining
[00:54:05.240 --> 00:54:11.960]   But some people just didn't have that from the get-go and I want to know you people how how did you not have any anxiety about it?
[00:54:11.960 --> 00:54:16.520]   From the start. You just like to look at your time on your phone. What's what's the deal?
[00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:18.280]   um
[00:54:18.280 --> 00:54:20.280]   I have to say there is
[00:54:20.280 --> 00:54:28.120]   There I mean you I I might have to talk to rosemary. It would be nice to have a focus mode that made it
[00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:32.680]   Really dark you can you know have a dark wallpaper black wallpaper
[00:54:32.680 --> 00:54:38.120]   And it dimmettens and I think I could do a a focus mode that would do all of that because
[00:54:38.120 --> 00:54:42.840]   Lisa married the wrong guy. She likes a bedroom that is pitch black
[00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:45.400]   Right. Oh me too. I got LEDs
[00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:49.480]   Coming out of my ass. Well, that's not quite true, but I
[00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:56.120]   We've seen the photos from burning man
[00:54:57.320 --> 00:54:59.320]   We thought it was very creative
[00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:03.240]   I was going health care and you were burning man
[00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:06.360]   Needless to say
[00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:14.200]   Leo's got the benefit of quite a brain trust here. He's a lucky lucky man as our all the listeners everywhere in the room
[00:55:14.200 --> 00:55:17.400]   There are lights lights lights lights everywhere
[00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:23.400]   And um, and this is just one more effect sheet complain last night. She says like the sun hitting me in the face
[00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:29.880]   Oh, you don't have the sleep mode turned on well, I do it's it's darker. Can it go off completely?
[00:55:29.880 --> 00:55:37.080]   Yeah on if you have um the the focus mode that's called sleep. I do well. Oh, it's not completely turn off
[00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:39.160]   Is this one called sleep?
[00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:44.280]   Well, so there's a built-in one that is called. Yeah. Yeah, I think that's the one uh, I think that's the one I have
[00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:50.040]   It's it should when it's on the charger. It should turn off. Well, it's maybe not. I don't know it's
[00:55:50.040 --> 00:55:52.840]   Uh, I didn't think it was
[00:55:53.640 --> 00:55:57.160]   I'll have to check that because mine does I know at night mine is off because I am
[00:55:57.160 --> 00:56:02.600]   Like wanting yeah, no light in the bedroom because that's not for you conducive for sleep
[00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:06.680]   Uh, let me turn on I'm gonna turn on sleep mode and then I'm gonna plug it in
[00:56:06.680 --> 00:56:11.160]   Um, and then I will lock the screen. I believe you
[00:56:11.160 --> 00:56:16.120]   Well, no, I'm I'm checking to be sure that it actually yeah. Yeah, it's completely off now
[00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:19.000]   So I'm making a new focus that is called sleep
[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:23.160]   Sleep focus while you're heading to bed together. Okay
[00:56:23.720 --> 00:56:25.720]   I thought I was using that
[00:56:25.720 --> 00:56:28.360]   People not allowed apps not allowed options
[00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:33.400]   Show on silence notifications high notification badges
[00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:36.600]   Uh, and then
[00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:42.440]   Oh, you can customize green as green on yes, so customize screen. So choose a lock screen or home screen page
[00:56:42.440 --> 00:56:48.360]   Um, but but but actually go back. Do you see right under that where it says options? Yeah
[00:56:48.360 --> 00:56:52.840]   Tap on options and make sure sleep screen is turned on. I don't have that in my
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:55.000]   That's notification options
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:57:00.120]   Then I don't know if it's the actual sleep focus or if it's one that you've just made that wall focus filters
[00:57:00.120 --> 00:57:04.280]   No, it's called sleep focus. I just selected a new one. Oh you did
[00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:11.000]   Uh, huh. Well, all right. This is a mystery because I can choose the home screen the lock screen and the watch screen
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:13.000]   But I don't see any you know off
[00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:15.080]   choices
[00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:18.840]   Interesting. I mean I could make a very dark lock screen. I ended up choosing a moon
[00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:25.400]   Um, you know because I thought well, it's night, but that's still you know even when it's dimmed which it is
[00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:27.480]   It's dimmed. It's just not off
[00:57:27.480 --> 00:57:29.880]   Yeah, so
[00:57:29.880 --> 00:57:32.040]   Here
[00:57:32.040 --> 00:57:33.720]   filter
[00:57:33.720 --> 00:57:34.680]   So
[00:57:34.680 --> 00:57:39.240]   There's this this is the one that I've got turned on right now and you should see in this options
[00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:44.520]   Section right underneath the customization. There should be an option that says sleep screen and show time
[00:57:44.520 --> 00:57:49.240]   And that says that's another options see that I was doing the first options
[00:57:49.320 --> 00:57:56.600]   Okay. Yeah, this is a new option sleep screen. This simplifies your phone lock screen to reduce distractions
[00:57:56.600 --> 00:57:59.240]   Yeah, so that's while you're winding down
[00:57:59.240 --> 00:58:03.640]   That will make it so that those uh that not as much as an off notifications
[00:58:03.640 --> 00:58:09.560]   It should then once you have locked your phone and it's charging it should turn off the phone completely
[00:58:09.560 --> 00:58:13.640]   Yes, or the display completely. Okay, so I don't have to choose a sleep
[00:58:13.640 --> 00:58:16.280]   Screen it will I will have it be
[00:58:16.920 --> 00:58:21.800]   Yeah, we'll try that tonight. We'll try that tonight. Okay. Yeah fingers crossed. Yeah
[00:58:21.800 --> 00:58:24.920]   Well yours is doing it. So it must be it must be possible
[00:58:24.920 --> 00:58:28.200]   Yeah, okay. Yeah, okay, and it is it is
[00:58:28.200 --> 00:58:35.240]   It adds so much value to this device particularly when you get dialed in correctly when they they do when they do it really well enough
[00:58:35.240 --> 00:58:40.840]   It's the it's illuminated just enough so that you can you can almost just see it through peripheral vision
[00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:42.920]   Like not through the cones of your eyes
[00:58:42.920 --> 00:58:46.680]   But like the color insensitive light more sensitive rods in your eyes
[00:58:46.680 --> 00:58:49.800]   And that's when like the times in the middle of the night where you wake up for a sec
[00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:52.120]   You just want to know oh damn I woke up
[00:58:52.120 --> 00:58:55.560]   Do I is is there any point to going back to sleep or not?
[00:58:55.560 --> 00:58:57.720]   And or gee my phone just made a noise
[00:58:57.720 --> 00:59:03.480]   But it's not supposed to make a noise is there an alert that I really need to pay attention to and these and all and always on display
[00:59:03.480 --> 00:59:09.160]   Uh, even when like if there's nothing to notify you about is really enhances the thing
[00:59:09.160 --> 00:59:16.120]   It turns into a smart display and when you talk about devices that you spend like six seven eight hundred a thousand twelve hundred dollars for
[00:59:16.120 --> 00:59:19.880]   That extra piece of value of this thing that's always going to be on your nightstand anyway
[00:59:19.880 --> 00:59:22.040]   It's just a really really great thing to have
[00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:25.800]   All right, it's all on you mica tonight's the night
[00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:29.640]   Yes
[00:59:29.640 --> 00:59:33.000]   You know in the morning
[00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:35.080]   Let's take a little break
[00:59:35.080 --> 00:59:37.160]   You're watching Mac break weekly Andy and not co
[00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:46.040]   My cusargent filling in for Jason Snell as the day off. Alex is also out and we're very grateful to Steven roblas from uh apple insider
[00:59:46.040 --> 00:59:48.120]   He filled in until his power
[00:59:48.120 --> 00:59:54.280]   His power went off our show today brought to you and I presume john ashley you're an expert in this
[00:59:54.280 --> 01:00:02.760]   By the new tech tricaster to elite that's what we do with all of our production the most complete live production system on the planet
[01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:10.280]   And some new features that have just recently come out new tech as you might know offers a full line of tricasters effect when we started to do video
[01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:13.320]   Wow, it's now
[01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:15.320]   About 14 years ago
[01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:18.760]   Uh, I was trying to figure out how we do this talk to Alex lensy
[01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:22.760]   He said no good a hardware switcher and I said I can't afford a hardware switcher
[01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:25.000]   So I said i'm getting a tricaster
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:29.000]   It was the best choice ever because as we've grown tricaster has grown
[01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:33.160]   With us so the first time out I got the you know the least expensive model
[01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:38.760]   But we've slowly improved and improved as time goes by because we have new needs new capabilities and now
[01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:45.720]   We've got the tricaster to elite. It's uh, it's an all-encompassing digital media solution designed to create content
[01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:49.000]   For the internet mobile and television distribution
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:56.520]   Late last year they uh unleashed an updated version of the tricaster to elite with a lot of new features the live call connect feature
[01:00:56.920 --> 01:01:02.360]   Which has been around for a while has now been added uh, support for a facebook messenger
[01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:11.880]   What's app and facetime as inputs to any production plus selectable audio and video return now enables the tricaster to elite operators to view an audio return
[01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:14.840]   Just like any other output allowing greater flexibility
[01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:18.440]   They have this new neural voice isolation tool
[01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:23.560]   That cleans up the audio automatically is using ai it can cancel or reduce background noise
[01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:27.880]   Automatically detect voices maintains your of course audio
[01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:32.200]   Quality it's interesting because you think tricaster is all about video, but no they realize
[01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:40.040]   And they're absolutely right audio is very very important. So they have very very good audio support lots of new
[01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:47.080]   features flexibility power, but still simple enough for even an idiot like me to use
[01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:48.680]   In fact
[01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:53.480]   One of the ways they make it simple is macros and now they've got variable support and macros
[01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:57.400]   John and others will program the macros for me so I can go in my office
[01:01:57.400 --> 01:02:04.680]   And do stuff with just a simple key press makes it so much easier for me to do the lower thirds to do all sorts of stuff that I
[01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:09.480]   Really i'm not going to be able to do on my own. It's a dynamic and powerful tool
[01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:16.520]   Allows operators now to nest macros to deliver complex productions more easily the tricaster to elite now supports
[01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:21.080]   encoding three channels and anything from hd to uhd at the same
[01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:29.880]   Time which is really awesome. They've also brought the live panel builder into the tricaster meaning you can create your own user interfaces
[01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:35.560]   Customize each preset within the user interface again a great way to have it set up
[01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:41.720]   Just right for the production you're doing and if you've got distributed workflows it makes them simpler more cohesive
[01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:45.480]   And of course you never compromise on quality with the tricaster. It's the best
[01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:48.680]   That's why so many television channels
[01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:52.120]   local sports churches
[01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:55.400]   Use the tricaster. It's a
[01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:57.400]   transformative
[01:02:57.400 --> 01:02:59.400]   technology better than broadcast
[01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:05.960]   That since it's arrival in 2020 tricaster 2 elite has offered an incredibly powerful life production system
[01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:09.560]   For almost any kind of streamer and broadcaster
[01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:14.280]   And the very latest updates have just added add even more power. I love it
[01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:16.920]   uh, the nd i gen lock tool
[01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:21.000]   Allows tricaster to elite users to match outputs to a common sync pulse
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:25.480]   So it makes it very easy to sync up your video for pinpoint accuracy
[01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:30.600]   Great, you can use it for remote workflows even alpha channel can be sent through one of the mix outs
[01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:37.960]   Which brings post production closer to live users can use the keying on a tricaster feed graphics or real-time 3d creation tools
[01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:42.120]   Uh, I don't even know what i'm saying our team does and that's the important part
[01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:45.480]   They are really good and don't forget the tricaster one pro
[01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:53.480]   It's an evolution in modern storytelling for producers content creators and publishers with future ready capabilities stream-lined
[01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:57.320]   video production system live video production system
[01:03:57.320 --> 01:04:01.000]   Including live call connect support for 4k uhd switching
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.560]   Live streaming recording and data driven
[01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:07.000]   Yeah, when we started with a tricaster 4k was just a twinkle
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:12.360]   In an engineer's eye and now it's everywhere explore the latest in the tricaster

[01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:45.720]   Tricaster for making our productions sing we couldn't do it without you. We really really appreciate it
[01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:49.640]   I don't know if this is a one-off
[01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:54.600]   Uh, or if there's a problem here. This is from a sub stack
[01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:57.320]   Uh newsletter called the runners newsletter
[01:04:57.320 --> 01:05:06.360]   Uh, and it's one guy, but he did a analysis with a lot of technology on the apple watch
[01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:13.560]   And how it measures stride and running and one thing he found he coined the term erratic mode
[01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:17.320]   Yeah, it gives you some idea of the problem
[01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:19.240]   Uh
[01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:22.600]   The biggest issue since watch os 8 is that it runs most of the time
[01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:25.320]   In what i call erratic mode
[01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:29.240]   Um, now he says he's able to get it to settle down
[01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:34.760]   For instance, if he pauses he has to cross a busy street and his running one of the reasons he
[01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:38.760]   He noticed this is because he does the exact same run
[01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:44.280]   All the time a 9.7 kilometer run through busy areas of a city
[01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:47.080]   Uh trees and water
[01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:55.080]   Uh, nikey usually logged between 9.6 and 9.8 kilometers, but sometimes had weird swings when I started using apple's workout app with watch os 7
[01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:57.560]   Results were similar
[01:05:57.560 --> 01:06:03.160]   The first 50 to 150 meters had tracking issues like it was getting started, but most of the time everything worked okay with some
[01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:08.440]   Weird measurements down then since watch os 8 i've had a lot of issues that tracking my runs
[01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:14.280]   I have logged 135 runs with watch os 8 a few more on 9 since the release
[01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:17.560]   128 of them on the same exact route
[01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:24.840]   Uh, he says when he stops of the light and presses the pause button it usually fixes the erratic mode
[01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:30.040]   So you can even see the graphs here that he has a collection of speed plots
[01:06:30.760 --> 01:06:32.920]   Where it's in erratic mode and then it fixes itself
[01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:38.280]   About 80 percent of the cases start in erratic mode it lasts about 18 minutes on average, but varies a lot
[01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:42.280]   It makes frankly the statistics kind of not so useful
[01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:48.360]   Yeah, that's concerning. Yeah, now I have to point out this is one guy. He says he contacted apple
[01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:51.560]   Uh, they gave him all sorts of things to do
[01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:57.800]   But this and this is the thing that's a little scary when support finally after many calls
[01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:03.160]   contacted an engineer they told me the errors were within their accepted margins
[01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:07.960]   Uh, sometimes
[01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:11.000]   Yeah, I I don't know about you andy, but one of the I
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:14.680]   I see a lot anytime we're looking at different
[01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:20.280]   Situations where people are contacting support and apple support is helping out
[01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:27.000]   You see all of these different possible responses and all of these different answers and and it can be just you know
[01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:33.000]   out of the blue uh one one type of answer or the other and I've I always struggle
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:40.040]   Uh about whether I should suggest that people kind of take that with a grain of salt or if well, that's true with all customer service
[01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:43.560]   I mean really and i'm sure apple's customer service guys are better trained than many but
[01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:46.200]   Ultimately, you can't hire enough people
[01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:53.720]   Who are really skilled so you give them a notebook you give them some training and they're gonna do what they're taught and trained how to do
[01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:57.960]   And that's a very they're almost on rails a very narrow scope
[01:07:57.960 --> 01:08:01.880]   But that's why when he this is the thing that's concerning. Yeah, I'd expect that from
[01:08:01.880 --> 01:08:07.400]   You know the first line support, but when they escalated to an engineer, that's the highest escalation
[01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:10.680]   You know somebody's actually working on the product and they said no no
[01:08:10.680 --> 01:08:16.600]   That's within our margin of error. We don't expect it to be more accurate than that
[01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:19.160]   That's a little bit interesting to me
[01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:22.760]   The only reason I mentioned this you know, no, you're you're right i've my
[01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:28.920]   My I react that way because there are better ways to convey the same information that
[01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:34.760]   Yeah, it's a little bit more polite. It's it's like when someone someone's telling you something you already know and you say
[01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:38.600]   I know that as opposed to I think you're right. Yes, that you're right about that
[01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:45.800]   Uh, but and also this is a customer who's unsatisfied with their product and that does sound a little bit snippy
[01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:52.760]   Um, it's both even though they even though the engineer might be absolutely correct that sometimes a customer is asking for a level of
[01:08:53.320 --> 01:08:58.200]   Purity that it's just not the thing was just not sold as nonetheless when someone is trained
[01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:02.200]   There are people there are people that are serious trainers and also they're just serious about
[01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:06.760]   Completing those rings and and getting that data logged. I have a I have a friend
[01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:12.120]   Uh, I have a friend shout out to marie at the metropolton opera. She's
[01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:15.320]   One of her she posted instagram
[01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:21.560]   Last week about the final dress rehearsals for one of the productions and she can't wear her apple watch because of course
[01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:27.960]   This isn't 1893. This is 1890 whatever and so she's wearing it strapped around her leg to make sure she gets
[01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:34.280]   For all of the steps that she's taking like well during that day and and and while being on stage
[01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:37.800]   So this is the sort of person who when they contact customer service say look
[01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:39.800]   I'm not getting credit for the workouts that i'm doing
[01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:43.960]   Either because of ego, which is fine or even because look i'm training
[01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:48.440]   I need to have this data because i'm playing to do something that is outside my normal limits
[01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:54.280]   Uh, and in two months time, I need to be prepared for that. So yeah, you'd you'd hope that they'd be a little bit more
[01:09:54.280 --> 01:09:59.160]   I don't know what's unclear is it may be that that's his watch and that we're getting better results
[01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:05.640]   But the engineer is saying yeah, sometimes some of these watches it's not very accurate or it may be
[01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:12.040]   I mean remember this is on your wrist. It's not the ideal the temperatures is a perfect example
[01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:15.080]   They don't say it's body temperature. They say it's wrist temperature
[01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:19.800]   But you'd have to look carefully to really see that they imply that they're measuring body temperature
[01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:25.560]   Uh, so I I guess if you're a runner
[01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:31.800]   Maybe you should maybe I think we need more information. Maybe you should look at a garment instead. I don't know
[01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:36.760]   Um, I have seen people say yeah, this is nice for 79.99. It's good
[01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:41.960]   It's not a garment for runner. It's not the it's not the thousand dollar garment. So I don't know if
[01:10:42.680 --> 01:10:46.200]   I don't know. I just I mean, there's a part of me that just goes
[01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:54.680]   I that that kind of makes sense because you've got one device that yes now it is more heavily focused on
[01:10:54.680 --> 01:10:58.920]   People who are active and doing all this and that and the other
[01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:04.040]   But it is also still an apple watch that has all of the other features that an apple watch has
[01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:06.680]   But if you buy a purpose built device
[01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:09.480]   Then absolutely you're going to get
[01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:14.520]   Better metrics out of that and so it's kind of it's a back and forth I think but
[01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:19.960]   With the knowledge that yes, you're spending more for this you expect it to be premium
[01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:25.480]   You expect it to do all of these things that uh, it should do and if it's not exactly accurate
[01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:30.040]   Then I guess it comes down to kind of where we're seeing health measurements go in general
[01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:34.680]   Where before it was all about this nitty gritty measurement and now it's more about trends
[01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:37.960]   And the numbers themselves aren't as important
[01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:41.560]   So if you use those data points as a runner
[01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:46.200]   From the perspective of getting the exact right number versus these sort of
[01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:50.840]   Coach messages that say oh, you know, you're running slower than you did last time
[01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:52.360]   Do you want to pick it up?
[01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:56.760]   And the stuff that the apple watch provides then yeah, I think the garment is probably a better bet for you
[01:11:56.760 --> 01:11:58.280]   Yeah
[01:11:58.280 --> 01:12:00.280]   Excellent point. Yeah
[01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:02.440]   Uh, so german
[01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:04.600]   in his latest newsletter
[01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:06.360]   speculating
[01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:10.680]   But you know when mark says something, you know, and we've talked about this when rene used to be on the show
[01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:13.400]   He would say now you have to understand mark says two different
[01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:20.840]   Categories there's I have from heard from sources and i'm thinking this is in the i'm thinking category
[01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:23.000]   But we are so close
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:29.480]   To what would be an october event that I don't I think this rises to a higher level than mark just speculating
[01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:32.840]   I feel like he's got some inside information
[01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:38.600]   He says maybe not an event next month. Maybe they'll do it all by press release
[01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:43.080]   Uh, and i'm guessing that he wouldn't have published that so close
[01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:48.600]   To the event unless he had pretty he had a pretty high confidence that there wasn't going to be an event
[01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:53.320]   I wouldn't hear i want to hear Andy first
[01:12:53.320 --> 01:12:56.200]   Okay
[01:12:56.200 --> 01:13:02.680]   Well, first of all this this another thing that uh, rene very wisely said was that there's a difference between things that he says
[01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:07.400]   In his bloomberg column and things that he says in his newsletter, and I think that he said this in his newsletter
[01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:12.120]   Uh, so that doesn't mean that he's made bloomberg has different standards for stuff in the
[01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:14.600]   publication right?
[01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:18.280]   And I think historically the the great thing about him is that he has a really
[01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:21.320]   A great track record and also a provable track record
[01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:23.240]   You can go back and see
[01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:28.840]   The correlation between things that he said and things he speculated about and things that actually happened then you go back and see how he
[01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:32.040]   Speculated and how he reported certain things so newsletter
[01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:37.640]   From from german says that he has some good information. He doesn't have an absolutely on lock
[01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:41.640]   But it's valuable enough for for people that he thought he'd mentioned in the newsletter
[01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:45.800]   Um when we think about but when we think about stuff that we're
[01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:51.800]   That apple's rumor to announce in october. We are thinking about things that could simply be
[01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:55.800]   Again, my my dream is mac benny, but just take all the really good
[01:13:55.800 --> 01:14:01.560]   Uh new ultra ultra m1's or m2 processors and basically updated from the
[01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:08.920]   Basic m1 that came out two years ago to a practical modern modern CPU doesn't even have to be a completely reinvented
[01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:13.480]   Revitalized one just give just give me something modern that can have four displays on it, etc
[01:14:13.480 --> 01:14:16.120]   Uh, we're thinking about maybe a
[01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:23.720]   Maybe an update to the ipad although that's not certainly a lock and we're wondering if there if apple's going to decide to
[01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:27.000]   Forgiet release something that could be called a mac pro
[01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:32.920]   This year although that may or may not happen and all of those things there a mac pro would have to
[01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:34.840]   We would think there would have to be an event
[01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:38.680]   But they could just simply announce it this this year and then release it later on
[01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:42.760]   So I don't think that I don't think that the idea of apple doing press releases
[01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:49.800]   Uh is out of is out of bounds here. I think that that's a that's a very practical thing for a practical thing to consider
[01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:51.400]   And also
[01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:54.520]   Realize when you say press releases we don't we're not talking about
[01:14:55.160 --> 01:15:00.040]   Everybody wakes up and suddenly at 9 a.m. Eastern time there's a press release and there's there's stuff on our inbox
[01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:04.280]   We're also talking about certain people have already been called to kupertino
[01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:08.760]   Certain people have been you have been under nda about this and testing them up for two weeks
[01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:15.160]   And there are videos that are going to suddenly appear on 12 very very important influential youtube channels all at once
[01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:21.000]   So I don't I there is nothing about this that I think is silly. I don't know I wouldn't put money on it either way
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:24.680]   Uh, but I don't think that's a silly thing for to to think about
[01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:27.640]   Micah
[01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:29.800]   I
[01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:31.960]   This is a tough one. Um because
[01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:37.480]   everything that I knew suggested that there would be some sort of
[01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:41.000]   Event happening in october that there would be
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:45.080]   Uh because let's look at like a year ago
[01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:52.040]   Um because the the argument here is that the m2 was already announced and so we know about the m2
[01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:58.440]   So we could just do press release for the rest of these devices because they're all going to basically have the m2 be at the ipads or the max
[01:15:58.440 --> 01:15:59.640]   but
[01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:06.600]   When we did it with the m1 when apple did it with the m1 they had the initial announcement of the m1 with the lower
[01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:12.680]   Specced devices, but then they had another event where they showed the m1 with that
[01:16:12.680 --> 01:16:19.640]   With the pro with the max version where you had two of them side by side and that whole thing was announced and uh, it was all very exciting
[01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:22.200]   the argument could be that
[01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:27.640]   That was a time to have an event because they were showing revealing that two
[01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:32.680]   Chips could be laid side by side and connected and they needed to explain that a little bit more
[01:16:32.680 --> 01:16:37.000]   And so this year they don't really need to explain it, but I just I don't know
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:42.840]   It's kind of a lot of devices potential devices to be announced in just press release form
[01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:45.480]   um, so it just
[01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:47.720]   It runs contrary to
[01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:54.840]   What I would expect and in that way I find it interesting if what he's saying is is true
[01:16:54.840 --> 01:16:58.840]   But yes, of course always with the caveat that this was one of those
[01:16:58.840 --> 01:17:04.280]   I think that they may not because of this that and the other I just I don't know. I think they still will
[01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:08.760]   Uh, he says apple might have not have enough fair left
[01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:14.040]   In 2022 for another big event not enough gas in the tank and it's true that those are
[01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:18.920]   You know, those are big productions. They've got to do a lot of filming and they've got to do a lot of you know
[01:17:18.920 --> 01:17:21.400]   Production and getting people out there
[01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:27.160]   Um, he does agree with you, Andy that you know, there'll be a m2 and m2 pro mac minis
[01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:29.720]   That's good news for all of us mac mini lovers
[01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:33.560]   M2 pro and m2 max 14 and 16-inch macbook pros
[01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:37.080]   M2 11 inch and 12.9 inch ipad
[01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:43.240]   Pros he also says it might be an update to the apple tv with an a14 and a ram boost
[01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:49.000]   Um, he does say I don't think the m2 based mac pro will be released
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:53.240]   In 2023. This is contrary to what apple's already promised but
[01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:57.880]   You know, he says none of these new projects products is a major departure
[01:17:57.880 --> 01:18:00.120]   from apple
[01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:03.560]   So so that's why he says he's thinking but again
[01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:07.400]   The fact that he says is so close to when we would start getting invitations
[01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:12.200]   Uh, it makes me give to think there's a higher level of certainty
[01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:15.960]   Now i've also heard from people who were at the apple event that there were winks and nudges
[01:18:15.960 --> 01:18:20.280]   That from apple employees like see you next month kind of thing
[01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:23.480]   So I so you know, I don't know what to think
[01:18:23.480 --> 01:18:27.800]   Um apple certainly could do another event they get a lot of attention for another event
[01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:29.800]   But
[01:18:29.800 --> 01:18:31.800]   You know, maybe they're tired
[01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:38.440]   Yeah, I mean it's also possible that this was given when mark is talking about this that it was a change in the plans
[01:18:38.440 --> 01:18:41.240]   It could be that uh originally that was in
[01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:47.720]   Because of the the fact that they can pre-record these and that they can you know set them up
[01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:53.720]   Uh, that part of it at least had a moments notice and because it would in theory be on their own campus
[01:18:53.720 --> 01:18:59.640]   They're not having to uh fit it around some large venue that doesn't belong to them that they have to plan out even more
[01:18:59.640 --> 01:19:01.480]   And I guess
[01:19:01.480 --> 01:19:03.160]   If you've just done it
[01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:06.440]   Then you know the logistics of how to make it happen
[01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:10.120]   So it's not as difficult to do it again. And then I guess in that way
[01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:15.160]   There's not as much what's that term when you buy a thing and then you feel like you have to buy yours for morse
[01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:22.920]   No, no, it's it's um sunk cost sunk cost. Yeah. Yeah, so there maybe is not as much sunk cost feeling about it
[01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:25.400]   They're like, yeah, we don't need to do this. So let's not do it
[01:19:25.400 --> 01:19:31.400]   They can certainly get attention. I think it's interesting what you said, Andy and mark kind of says this as well
[01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:33.000]   that
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.800]   And maybe this is a test for apple. What if we release
[01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:40.680]   early versions to mark has brownly and and iJustine and
[01:19:40.680 --> 01:19:46.360]   And let them do big splashy reveals on their channel
[01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:52.920]   Will we get enough as much attention? Will we get it as much and maybe it's a test, you know the times change
[01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:59.640]   And uh, it might be that those marquee names can bring a lot of attention that you don't have to bring people out
[01:19:59.880 --> 01:20:04.760]   Yeah, I have to I have to say that if you look at the track of who gets pre-release hardware
[01:20:04.760 --> 01:20:08.120]   It used to be okay. Well, usa today is definitely gonna get it
[01:20:08.120 --> 01:20:11.160]   Yeah, well, the while phosphor is gonna get it. Your time's gonna get it
[01:20:11.160 --> 01:20:15.480]   And now it really is like which really really popular youtube's or youtuber
[01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:21.720]   Youtubers are gonna get it and then which other and maybe joanna sternet the journal and uh, yeah
[01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:26.200]   No, which is which i want to make sure i don't that's not but they're focused on video
[01:20:26.360 --> 01:20:31.880]   No, no, no, but they're focused on people who are doing video and i think producers that they may say to themselves
[01:20:31.880 --> 01:20:36.200]   Yeah, especially for these pro devices. That's what we want to give these two
[01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:43.080]   Uh, and let them do a splashy roll out all at the same time for it. I think that's kind of intriguing by the way
[01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:45.080]   I also appreciate mark putting in
[01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:52.840]   Completely random reasons a picture of eddy q on the floor of the warriors chase arena yelling at steff curry
[01:20:53.320 --> 01:21:01.080]   And by the way speaking of courage eddy's wearing flip flops now wearing flip flops courtside is a very courageous
[01:21:01.080 --> 01:21:03.320]   That is a thing to do. Yeah
[01:21:03.320 --> 01:21:09.640]   You got to be a brave man. It bear your toes in front of steff curry and a bunch of other eight foot tall people
[01:21:09.640 --> 01:21:17.640]   That's i said i said once 20 years ago and they're bigger than you realize when you're right there
[01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:21.560]   Uh, they're huge and bare feet. I don't know
[01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:25.400]   Yeah, god god god love them
[01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:31.400]   As my as my as my mom would say or anybody at her parish would say god god
[01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:37.720]   God bless bless his heart actually eddy has a big victory to talk about i've been noticing a lot of ads
[01:21:37.720 --> 01:21:43.160]   Yeah, the super bowl halftime show featuring taylor swift brought to you by
[01:21:43.160 --> 01:21:45.560]   apple
[01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:47.720]   Apple music usually it's pepsi
[01:21:47.720 --> 01:21:51.160]   Usually it's a i mean these are that's a marquee
[01:21:52.360 --> 01:21:56.120]   Precision for a brand apple music not just apple but apple music
[01:21:56.120 --> 01:22:01.640]   So they so they basically gave the nfl the same talk that steve jobs gave to scully saying
[01:22:01.640 --> 01:22:06.120]   Do you want to do you want to sell sugar water to take little kids or do you want to help change the world?
[01:22:06.120 --> 01:22:12.760]   Yeah, ryan is also headlining so maybe say all that matters to me is that apple music was able to get riana to perform it
[01:22:12.760 --> 01:22:18.040]   Super bowl that's incredible that i mean if eddy q needed to bear his toes to make that happen
[01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:20.840]   Fantastic. Yeah, do you think that was the
[01:22:22.120 --> 01:22:24.120]   The stipulation i don't want to speculate
[01:22:24.120 --> 01:22:26.120]   Yeah
[01:22:26.120 --> 01:22:26.920]   surprising
[01:22:26.920 --> 01:22:31.080]   It's surprising this is the first time that like a a music streamer
[01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:38.200]   Uh is the first time to pran this show because they can the the reason why like pepsi and these other really big brands is because they already
[01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:43.080]   Had marketing agreements going on with prince with all these like huge huge marquee groups
[01:22:43.080 --> 01:22:49.800]   But apple music they can bring in the absolute top of the list people you're not going to have a vega stage magician
[01:22:50.280 --> 01:22:53.240]   Doing the halftime show which is what used to happen in the early 80s
[01:22:53.240 --> 01:22:58.760]   And you should definitely look up early 80s nfl halftime show if you wanted to see the epitome of okay
[01:22:58.760 --> 01:23:03.080]   Well clearly nobody's watching tv during the halftime show. It doesn't matter what we put on there
[01:23:03.080 --> 01:23:08.600]   Uh, so this yeah, that could be why did i think taylor so i saw swear to god i saw her in the ad
[01:23:08.600 --> 01:23:13.400]   But i don't see her name on here. It's ryan i think she has something to do with apple music
[01:23:13.400 --> 01:23:19.160]   Oh, maybe this like i love apple music so much and now i'm glad to see that do the host the halftime show
[01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:25.000]   Unfox featuring not me. I don't know i saw her in the ad maybe i wasn't paying close attention
[01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:30.120]   I will tell you you're not alone. I did see something about taylor swift and and apple music and stuff too
[01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:35.000]   So that came from somewhere. It's not just you didn't make it up i promise all of our schuster
[01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:40.200]   Whose apple's vice president of apple music and beat says ryan is an incredible according artist
[01:23:40.200 --> 01:23:44.200]   Is a favorite for many millions of apple music customers around the world?
[01:23:44.200 --> 01:23:47.240]   We're excited to partner with ryan a rock nation
[01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:50.120]   And the nfl
[01:23:50.120 --> 01:23:54.920]   To bring music and sports fans and mementis show what an incredible artist for the inogural
[01:23:54.920 --> 01:23:59.800]   That's interesting apple music super bowl halftime show the inogural
[01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:07.720]   First and many so over the coming months expect to see exclusive deals and sneak peeks leading up to the apple music super bowl halftime show
[01:24:07.720 --> 01:24:10.840]   By following apple music on tiktok instagram and twitter
[01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:16.840]   Yeah, and apple is also one of the one the groups that is actively actively
[01:24:16.840 --> 01:24:20.200]   Fighting to get nfl shows for their streaming platform
[01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:24.440]   Yeah, maybe this is maybe this was one of the sweeteners to the deal saying by the way
[01:24:24.440 --> 01:24:29.240]   That's why we'll be able to give you super bowl halftime shows like you wouldn't believe that's how you get in the river
[01:24:29.240 --> 01:24:33.880]   And we will be the underwriting sponsor for the next x years. No matter how this deal goes
[01:24:33.880 --> 01:24:37.240]   Maybe they're relegating so many the jettress says
[01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:41.800]   Uh, maybe they're really getting tailored to the you know the pregame tailgate party
[01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:48.680]   That would be she's done. She's done a halftime show. I'm sure before I'm pretty sure I remember her
[01:24:48.680 --> 01:24:53.720]   Uh, anyway riana. So that's a big deal. You're telling me young person. Yeah, riana
[01:24:53.720 --> 01:25:01.240]   Yes, so riana has not released a new album in a long long time and because she's been so focused on both her
[01:25:01.240 --> 01:25:03.880]   cosmetics line and her
[01:25:04.280 --> 01:25:10.520]   Fashion line. She has not done a lot of music stuff in a long time. So this is actually a huge deal that she's going to be performing
[01:25:10.520 --> 01:25:14.760]   Live for the first time in forever. Here is her tweet that kind of broke the news
[01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:17.480]   Oh
[01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:22.760]   Cool for the folks who are listening it is a football in the hand of a person who it has some
[01:25:22.760 --> 01:25:26.360]   Significant hint of to it. Yeah, and a tattoo
[01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:33.480]   I suppose that's riana's got to be riana's hand. I mean, I must be recognizable as as riana's hand
[01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:39.400]   Uh, it got 283 000 retweets 119 quote tweets and 1.8 million likes
[01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:42.040]   So obviously people looked at that and went oh
[01:25:42.040 --> 01:25:46.280]   Riana's gonna be at the halftime show
[01:25:46.280 --> 01:25:52.360]   And anybody anybody wants to throw shade at taylor swift the you're you're not me
[01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:55.480]   You're looking for you're looking forward to her october her october album as much as pretty much
[01:25:55.480 --> 01:25:58.680]   Not me. I wouldn't in a million years
[01:25:58.680 --> 01:26:03.560]   Uh, so all right. Yeah, i'm just gonna be remain puzzled by that
[01:26:03.880 --> 01:26:05.880]   Uh, let's see what else
[01:26:05.880 --> 01:26:07.880]   Uh, i'm just looking at bloomberg
[01:26:07.880 --> 01:26:14.120]   Mark's bloomberg newsletter because there was a lot of juice in this newsletter and another another news
[01:26:14.120 --> 01:26:22.040]   He says the by now pay later feature that apple announced at wwdc is mysteriously delayed
[01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:25.480]   What's the story there morning glory?
[01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:26.840]   So
[01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:32.200]   This is so for folks who may not remember apple did announce that they would be doing the thing
[01:26:32.600 --> 01:26:37.640]   That a lot of different fin tech companies are doing where you are able to
[01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:40.920]   Go online and when you find an item that is
[01:26:40.920 --> 01:26:43.080]   costly
[01:26:43.080 --> 01:26:45.480]   Say, you know $300. We'll just go with that
[01:26:45.480 --> 01:26:54.600]   The different fin tech companies will help you split that up into a certain number of payments and depending on who you use for that
[01:26:54.600 --> 01:26:59.080]   Uh, they may charge you some interest on those payments
[01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:03.160]   So it basically evens out to a loan that you're paying over time or
[01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:09.320]   Many of them do interest-free loans where you just split up the payments into a certain number of
[01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:12.600]   Actual payments paid out
[01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:17.320]   Apple said that they would be doing this with apple pay itself
[01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:21.960]   So you could uh go and anywhere where you would do an apple pay payment
[01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:28.760]   It's unclear sort of the the limits because some services will do even payments as small as like 40 bucks
[01:27:29.400 --> 01:27:30.520]   Or rather
[01:27:30.520 --> 01:27:32.600]   Full purchases as small as 40 bucks
[01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:37.640]   In this case you go through you make an apple pay payment and then instead of paying for it all right there up front
[01:27:37.640 --> 01:27:44.280]   Apple would give you an option to pay out in four equal installments with 0% APR
[01:27:44.280 --> 01:27:48.920]   So basically you would not be paying extra for it just the cost itself
[01:27:48.920 --> 01:27:55.800]   And now it seems like uh while that was meant to release with uh, ios 16
[01:27:56.520 --> 01:28:02.520]   It is and there's a setting that's available in your phone already to turn on that allow payments option
[01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:05.240]   It is not there and apparently
[01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:08.680]   Uh apple is still working to make it possible
[01:28:08.680 --> 01:28:11.000]   So coming in a future update
[01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.480]   They say may not be available in all states
[01:28:13.480 --> 01:28:18.920]   I wonder if they're legal issues or maybe they're sensitive to the fact that especially in an economic downturn
[01:28:18.920 --> 01:28:21.000]   Bnpl
[01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:25.800]   Can be a bad thing for some people yeah, excuse to buy stuff
[01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:27.400]   They can't afford well
[01:28:27.400 --> 01:28:33.560]   Another thing could be that they're part of what what's going to make this work for them is the ability to basically oh you're you'd have
[01:28:33.560 --> 01:28:39.480]   Made payments guess what your phone has been deactivated until you resume your payments kind of like what kind of weather was really chintzy
[01:28:39.480 --> 01:28:47.160]   Uh, we finance anybody car loan companies do where they put a tracker then and a disruptor on the car that says oh by the way
[01:28:47.160 --> 01:28:52.280]   We've disrupted your two days late. We're gonna give you charge you a $500 extra fee and you're stranded in the middle of nowhere
[01:28:52.680 --> 01:28:59.240]   So that's we you know, it's it's a weird thing as it'd be interesting. It would be more interesting if they made that a benefit of
[01:28:59.240 --> 01:29:05.400]   Actually, maybe it is that that's not a benefit of uh of having the apple bang for something on the apple card is it
[01:29:05.400 --> 01:29:10.040]   I know this is a separate. Yeah, this is okay as part of apple pay
[01:29:10.040 --> 01:29:15.480]   So yeah, you could yeah, you could not have an apple card and still be able to do these people would still have to qualify
[01:29:15.480 --> 01:29:18.760]   So yeah, yeah, they yes the qualification is separate
[01:29:18.760 --> 01:29:22.680]   So basically even if you didn't qualify for the full-on apple card
[01:29:22.680 --> 01:29:25.480]   It is possible that you could qualify for one of these but then again
[01:29:25.480 --> 01:29:30.840]   That's where we're looking at that sort of moral issue of they couldn't qualify for the card should we you know
[01:29:30.840 --> 01:29:37.960]   Caught the card you don't you don't have you don't have a hundred dollars to spend on a new phone. Yeah, that's
[01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:46.840]   And I don't I don't want to be make the sound condescending at all because I mean there there are a lot of reasons why people don't don't carry a credit card
[01:29:47.320 --> 01:29:50.840]   Uh, there are people who can absolutely afford a brand new iPhone
[01:29:50.840 --> 01:29:59.480]   But you're right everybody everybody who's talked about this and thinking about this that the first time that apple gets associated with payday car loans
[01:29:59.480 --> 01:30:02.120]   That's not a good look for apple
[01:30:02.120 --> 01:30:08.680]   That's the same reason why I was wondering why they really wanted to be to get into banking why they really wanted to get into having their own credit card
[01:30:08.680 --> 01:30:16.600]   It's like the first time that someone they approved someone that got in over their head that and objectively another commentator would say
[01:30:16.600 --> 01:30:23.320]   Yeah, there's a reason there's someone almost they almost almost anybody else who they would have applied to they would have given them a lower credit
[01:30:23.320 --> 01:30:26.600]   Remit limit or basically made it harder for them to get themselves in
[01:30:26.600 --> 01:30:35.080]   $3,000 worth of debt that they can't pay back. That's that when that starts happening. That's a bad bad look for apple german says i'm hearing
[01:30:35.080 --> 01:30:43.560]   That's that's versus i'm thinking i'm hearing there have been fairly significant technical and engineering challenges in rolling out the service
[01:30:44.040 --> 01:30:47.560]   And that's leading to the delay. So I don't know we'll see
[01:30:47.560 --> 01:30:50.920]   So apparently there's it's not on the sort of should we do this side?
[01:30:50.920 --> 01:30:56.040]   No, we can't make this happen for some reason. We already talked about should we do it? We just can't do it. Yeah
[01:30:56.040 --> 01:31:02.120]   Yeah, we're worried about what happens to our tires when we run over people like that over and over and over again
[01:31:02.120 --> 01:31:05.560]   Should we have metal should the boot on their necks?
[01:31:05.560 --> 01:31:10.600]   Should it be more of a pressure thing or should it be more of a spikes on it that they're inflicting the pain?
[01:31:10.840 --> 01:31:16.120]   We just don't know yet. Uh bait a lot of the block of back and forth. No bad idea. This just in
[01:31:16.120 --> 01:31:18.680]   According to tmz and people
[01:31:18.680 --> 01:31:23.880]   Taylor Swift was offered the 2023 Super Bowl halftime show but turned it down
[01:31:23.880 --> 01:31:27.000]   So riana was a second choice
[01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:32.840]   Oh, that breaks my heart or third. We don't know there could have been others, but she was at least a second or
[01:31:32.840 --> 01:31:37.240]   Okay, here's what here's what really happened and by the way when I say what it really happened
[01:31:37.240 --> 01:31:41.640]   What I'm saying is this is what happened in my mind in my head makes me happier. Yes in my head
[01:31:41.640 --> 01:31:45.960]   This is what really happened. Yes riana was asked first
[01:31:45.960 --> 01:31:50.120]   And her people were like because of course they didn't get to talk to riana face-to-face
[01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:53.480]   They her people were like uh, we'll we'll we'll run it up the chain
[01:31:53.480 --> 01:31:57.640]   Well, you know, we'll see maybe maybe and while they were doing that they're like, oh man
[01:31:57.640 --> 01:32:03.000]   We got to find somebody else and of course taylor swift is a great second choice because biancé was not going to do it again
[01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:06.600]   She's too busy. So they went to taylor swift to next
[01:32:06.680 --> 01:32:08.680]   If you can't get the queen get the princess
[01:32:08.680 --> 01:32:16.040]   Yes, and then taylor swift was like, uh, no because i'm still kind of weird about streaming music services and how you devalue my music and
[01:32:16.040 --> 01:32:20.120]   Yeah, I like you pay people more apple, but still not so great about that
[01:32:20.120 --> 01:32:24.520]   And also i've got a tour to do and while she was in the middle of saying no with this long reason
[01:32:24.520 --> 01:32:28.760]   Why because of course you wrote like a letter that's whenever riana's people came back and said actually
[01:32:28.760 --> 01:32:35.240]   Rihanna's uh ready to do this as long as uh, we can talk a lot about her cosmetics that she tells in her fashion
[01:32:36.040 --> 01:32:38.040]   large oh lord
[01:32:38.040 --> 01:32:40.280]   Regulators are according
[01:32:40.280 --> 01:32:47.960]   Uh to pew earlier in the year scrutinizing bnpl by now pay later. So maybe it's good. Yeah as they should
[01:32:47.960 --> 01:32:50.440]   Yeah, you're seeing it everywhere. I've got a family member
[01:32:50.440 --> 01:32:54.920]   Who uh, i got him. Sorry. I was just really quick anecdote
[01:32:54.920 --> 01:32:59.960]   I have a family member who a younger family member and didn't quite grasp the
[01:32:59.960 --> 01:33:02.360]   seriousness of the situation
[01:33:02.360 --> 01:33:07.080]   I didn't know that they had this because I knew about by now pay later, but I didn't know it went as far as
[01:33:07.080 --> 01:33:10.760]   Essentially an app that is a payday loan service
[01:33:10.760 --> 01:33:15.720]   Like they had to set up. Yeah, and so they ended up getting you know
[01:33:15.720 --> 01:33:21.240]   Some of their paychecks completely taken away because they had signed up for this thing and I was so
[01:33:21.240 --> 01:33:27.960]   I was very upset not at them, but at the fact that this even existed that there apparently payday loan
[01:33:28.680 --> 01:33:33.080]   Apps essentially that are out there. That's ridiculous. Go ahead. No, no, I
[01:33:33.080 --> 01:33:36.520]   I'm 100 with you. What gets me mad is that now they're sort of
[01:33:36.520 --> 01:33:40.840]   The thing is like a lot of these shifty finance financial operators
[01:33:40.840 --> 01:33:45.080]   They look shifty like you drive you realize that when you're shopping for a new car
[01:33:45.080 --> 01:33:47.400]   You wonder why one is
[01:33:47.400 --> 01:33:55.000]   in what used to be a mcdonald's that went out of business in 1978 and one is a big building with a big lot and big
[01:33:55.160 --> 01:33:58.680]   And waiting for stuff like that and maybe the payday loan the payday loan
[01:33:58.680 --> 01:34:00.680]   Operator looks a little bit shifty
[01:34:00.680 --> 01:34:04.040]   It's when like you're checking out on just making a purchase on ebay
[01:34:04.040 --> 01:34:08.840]   And it's offering to split a payment into like X portions like oh wow, that's a really great feature ebay
[01:34:08.840 --> 01:34:12.120]   Thank you. I was gonna spend 400 dollars for this thing that I needed
[01:34:12.120 --> 01:34:15.400]   But yeah, it would be easier for us to spend it in in different payments
[01:34:15.400 --> 01:34:20.520]   And then like I've never I'm not speaking ill of whatever the service ebay is using
[01:34:20.520 --> 01:34:21.640]   I've never used it myself
[01:34:21.640 --> 01:34:27.800]   But the thing is like it feels like you trust ebay you trust apple you trust this operation
[01:34:27.800 --> 01:34:31.480]   And this and this and this feels like oh if I just click this checkbox
[01:34:31.480 --> 01:34:36.920]   I was worrying about how much i'm who's gonna have to like cut back in order to afford this and all in one thing
[01:34:36.920 --> 01:34:43.880]   Great. I'll do it this way without really appreciating that well here are things that this they're not actually offering this financial service themselves
[01:34:43.880 --> 01:34:47.160]   They are basically taking a commission on another company
[01:34:47.160 --> 01:34:51.160]   That doesn't care that you can't make your rent this week because they decided that
[01:34:51.320 --> 01:34:53.960]   Hey, we've been paying on time, but you're a little bit
[01:34:53.960 --> 01:34:56.200]   You're not really getting ahead of much
[01:34:56.200 --> 01:35:01.720]   We have the ability to simply take all the money out of your account to cover the balance and the future interest
[01:35:01.720 --> 01:35:05.240]   So that's what we did good luck paying your paying your rent this month because we just took
[01:35:05.240 --> 01:35:07.720]   We just took a hundred dollars out of your account right now
[01:35:07.720 --> 01:35:12.840]   That's the sort of stuff that people are going to get get hooked by as well as mica's situation where
[01:35:12.840 --> 01:35:16.920]   You have little kids who don't you know, they they go you have kids in school
[01:35:16.920 --> 01:35:21.000]   They learn how to they learn how to maybe survive an active shooter
[01:35:21.160 --> 01:35:24.840]   They do not learn how like interest works. They don't learn how loans work
[01:35:24.840 --> 01:35:30.280]   They don't learn how personal finance works and that's a doubly a problem in our society. Yeah
[01:35:30.280 --> 01:35:33.880]   I have one word for that tree parumpa bidur
[01:35:33.880 --> 01:35:37.240]   and
[01:35:37.240 --> 01:35:40.040]   Tree parumpa bidur
[01:35:40.040 --> 01:35:46.040]   Tree parumpa bidur is the factory on the outskirts of chanai, india where apple is now manufacturing
[01:35:46.120 --> 01:35:53.240]   It's iphone 14 for the first time ever. This is the beginning of apple transferring out of china
[01:35:53.240 --> 01:35:59.080]   Uh as we've been talking about for some time now how urgent that is. It's just the 14
[01:35:59.080 --> 01:36:05.320]   It's kind of driven by the fact that india has additional terrace for phones that are not manufactured in country
[01:36:05.320 --> 01:36:10.360]   So I suspect that has something to do with that as well foxcon will though is the manufacturer
[01:36:10.360 --> 01:36:12.920]   So it will be making devices
[01:36:13.720 --> 01:36:17.320]   And it's tree parumpa bidur factory in the outskirts of chanai
[01:36:17.320 --> 01:36:23.480]   This is the big this is going to eventually lead to them fully leaving china or is this a diversify?
[01:36:23.480 --> 01:36:27.960]   Other options. We know they're going to do vietnam plants, right uh brazil
[01:36:27.960 --> 01:36:30.600]   Plants, I think it's diversifying
[01:36:30.600 --> 01:36:35.320]   Got it. Absolutely. And also this is this is significant because they've they have been doing
[01:36:35.320 --> 01:36:39.000]   Indian manufacturing before to as you say comply with tariffs
[01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:43.640]   I think this is the first time that they've been doing no the brand new current phone that was just what it is this year
[01:36:43.960 --> 01:36:52.200]   Is being is being done locally and that's that's that is a scary thing if you are a chinese manufacturer because once you start demonstrating that no
[01:36:52.200 --> 01:37:00.600]   Manufacturing in vietnam vietnam factoring in india manufacturing brazil is absolutely in the same level of quality precision and reject rate
[01:37:00.600 --> 01:37:04.200]   As we've been doing and we've been doing it for 12 or 13 years on this line of phones
[01:37:04.200 --> 01:37:09.080]   That becomes scary when when apple cra apple and foxcon they crack the formula
[01:37:09.320 --> 01:37:16.920]   Here is how to build a factory literally anywhere in the world and build things to apples apples demands and apples tolerances apples labor rules
[01:37:16.920 --> 01:37:25.480]   Absolutely everything then suddenly they're not quite looking as a superstars that are indispensable as they have been for the past 12 years 13 years
[01:37:25.480 --> 01:37:27.560]   And it's clear apple knows how to take
[01:37:27.560 --> 01:37:35.320]   A manufacturing process and bring it up to its standard. I mean, you know for a long time stuff made in china was considered cheesy, right?
[01:37:36.120 --> 01:37:42.920]   Not anymore in fact all of our iphone 14 pros both the pros and the max are still made exclusively in china
[01:37:42.920 --> 01:37:46.280]   So yeah, but to but to I mean to chinese credit like
[01:37:46.280 --> 01:37:53.160]   Manufacturing for a for a decade and a half was that was their their their their Apollo program. That was their moon shot
[01:37:53.160 --> 01:38:01.240]   They were they were investing in that part of of of the economy's future and they did and do take great pride and no
[01:38:01.240 --> 01:38:04.920]   We're yes, yes, if you buy something a cheap knockoff from all the express
[01:38:04.920 --> 01:38:07.960]   It probably was manufactured in china for next to nothing
[01:38:07.960 --> 01:38:15.320]   But we are also the same manufacturers that can do spacecraft components to the talk to to the tolerances of any requirement whatsoever
[01:38:15.320 --> 01:38:18.840]   At a speed that has never been seen before south korea did the same thing in fact
[01:38:18.840 --> 01:38:20.280]   I think it was
[01:38:20.280 --> 01:38:22.600]   That was the model for the chinese government
[01:38:22.600 --> 01:38:30.600]   They looked at how south korea went from being the back of the drugstore crappy stuff to premiere quality stuff and they said we should we can do that too
[01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:37.240]   And they start and to be and also do they they started off by taking all of the every time that american companies for instance
[01:38:37.240 --> 01:38:44.200]   Decided to shut down and move their manufacturing elsewhere guess who was buying all of their factories and buying all of their machinery and shipping it back home
[01:38:44.200 --> 01:38:46.840]   it was again the
[01:38:46.840 --> 01:38:51.000]   The expanding chinese manufacturing sector. They mean this
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:59.720]   They again it's too bad that that it's often that it's often associated with cheap tachy knockoff stuff because they really are the crème dill or crème
[01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:06.520]   In terms of we need something that's manufactured for on a certain budget to an extreme tolerance to an amount of reliability
[01:39:06.520 --> 01:39:12.360]   And we need to be able to pivot very very quickly who can do that and the answer is almost always chinese fat manufacturing
[01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:14.680]   um
[01:39:14.680 --> 01:39:16.280]   We have talked
[01:39:16.280 --> 01:39:19.240]   Months ago about app tracking transparency
[01:39:19.240 --> 01:39:23.080]   Facebook's whining about apple turning that switch on
[01:39:23.080 --> 01:39:28.440]   Uh, we'd also mentioned that facebook has other ways around it as does as do other companies
[01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:32.920]   It's just one thing that apple's turning off the apple id for advertisers idfa
[01:39:32.920 --> 01:39:37.080]   Uh, well it turns out facebook was in fact getting around it
[01:39:37.080 --> 01:39:43.400]   Uh, and they are now being sued security researcher phillics crèce found that facebook
[01:39:43.400 --> 01:39:50.600]   Was getting around apple system. Oh, this is so evil by directing any link a user clicks in the app
[01:39:50.600 --> 01:39:54.040]   To a new in app browser window
[01:39:54.040 --> 01:39:56.680]   Where meta could inject code
[01:39:57.320 --> 01:40:01.960]   Alter the external websites track user behavior online without your consent or awareness
[01:40:01.960 --> 01:40:06.760]   as a result meta is facing two class action lawsuits
[01:40:06.760 --> 01:40:09.480]   um
[01:40:09.480 --> 01:40:14.280]   Saying it violated both state and federal privacy laws including
[01:40:14.280 --> 01:40:17.080]   The wire tap act
[01:40:17.080 --> 01:40:21.720]   The california invasion of privacy act and the california violation of the unfair competition
[01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:23.480]   Law
[01:40:23.480 --> 01:40:26.840]   Meta's been injecting code into third party websites
[01:40:26.840 --> 01:40:30.120]   Uh, yes, I was like wire tapping to me
[01:40:30.120 --> 01:40:31.480]   Yeah
[01:40:31.480 --> 01:40:34.840]   To to to make sure it's completely understood that doesn't mean that they've been
[01:40:34.840 --> 01:40:37.640]   A hijacking website. It does excuse me
[01:40:37.640 --> 01:40:40.920]   That it doesn't mean that when you launch the safari browser
[01:40:40.920 --> 01:40:44.280]   Facebook has injected code into all the websites that you're doing
[01:40:44.280 --> 01:40:51.000]   It means that people who think that of tapping on a link inside of facebook posts would take them to the safari browser outside of the app
[01:40:51.160 --> 01:40:57.320]   Their hack they haven't left the app itself. They have actually entered an in app browser that facebook has complete control over
[01:40:57.320 --> 01:41:03.000]   And that yeah, this was discovered like a little while ago and it's not surprising that this is turning to a class action suit
[01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:11.000]   Surprising and disappointing that's not turning into something that the justice department isn't isn't uh, isn't trying to get into because it really is
[01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.400]   It's it's it is the definition of what the ftc
[01:41:13.400 --> 01:41:19.560]   Doesn't need uh congressional laws to uh to handle there. They are they have they're mandated to punish
[01:41:19.800 --> 01:41:26.600]   Companies for deceptive behavior and I don't think it's either they can defend themselves that this is not deceptive behavior
[01:41:26.600 --> 01:41:31.000]   Facebook claimed they lost 10 billion dollars due to application tracking
[01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:32.760]   uh
[01:41:32.760 --> 01:41:34.440]   I
[01:41:34.440 --> 01:41:39.480]   I don't I always thought it was a little disingenuous the facebook was was saying that
[01:41:39.480 --> 01:41:42.360]   But meanwhile in the background and I'm you know
[01:41:42.360 --> 01:41:47.320]   It's are you even surprised that facebook was doing this?
[01:41:47.640 --> 01:41:53.480]   It's like of course they were uh, what is shock, you know, yeah, um, I hope they get the book thrown at them
[01:41:53.480 --> 01:41:58.280]   Oh, absolutely, but every time they get the book thrown at them. It's never enough to actually make a difference
[01:41:58.280 --> 01:42:01.960]   The book thrown at them is not enough money. They have never reformed their behavior
[01:42:01.960 --> 01:42:07.080]   They apologize and they keep doing it. They are they are currently under at least two consent agreements
[01:42:07.080 --> 01:42:11.080]   Uh to settle huge huge problems going going back to kamer gen and elitica
[01:42:11.080 --> 01:42:17.240]   The fact that the fact that the justice department and then the and the ftc and all these other regulators have not just somebody said
[01:42:17.320 --> 01:42:21.480]   Guess what you have now had your fourth strike and now guess what you get the sole cookies
[01:42:21.480 --> 01:42:24.360]   You get to be a cookie man. You get the cell actually baked goods
[01:42:24.360 --> 01:42:28.360]   You can see why literally they can't they won't do that and I think facebook knows it
[01:42:28.360 --> 01:42:34.520]   They they know grandma would be upset. So they know go come on. What are you gonna do? You're gonna find us again? Okay, fine
[01:42:34.520 --> 01:42:38.280]   Uh, they're not gonna shut we can't they can't shut them down
[01:42:38.280 --> 01:42:45.000]   Uh, I mean they can I suppose yeah, you agree, but you come on. That would be a suicide
[01:42:45.560 --> 01:42:49.400]   I think that if any company could be split apart. I think it definitely could be facebook
[01:42:49.400 --> 01:42:57.000]   Yeah, google google would be extremely difficult because they are really smart at tip tip towing on just the side of the angels
[01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:04.280]   You know, they could say oh, we've been noisy little boys and get and get off because they generally stay on the right side of the line
[01:43:04.280 --> 01:43:05.320]   Facebook though
[01:43:05.320 --> 01:43:11.160]   I've never I've never had a conversation with people who currently work in facebook at any level or have
[01:43:11.640 --> 01:43:17.000]   Or formally work at facebook at any level that made me think that they have proper respect for
[01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:23.880]   Limitations to their powers ras google. I can I've I've always had conversations that said yeah
[01:43:23.880 --> 01:43:29.320]   Well, look we're in the ad business. We have to collect data now our big challenge is to figure out how to do so without violating
[01:43:29.320 --> 01:43:34.120]   All these rules and all the spirits of all these rules because if we have we can't we can't build up
[01:43:34.120 --> 01:43:36.280]   If we're gonna reinvent a new system for collecting data
[01:43:36.520 --> 01:43:39.880]   We can't do it in such a way that we have to tear it down in a year and a half anyway
[01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:44.280]   So we have to figure out how to how to continue to survive in this area facebook
[01:43:44.280 --> 01:43:48.680]   Is just look there's data out there if you try to hide it from us
[01:43:48.680 --> 01:43:52.680]   It's like you're stealing from us and we present that and we're gonna just be twice as a good luck
[01:43:52.680 --> 01:43:58.680]   And also I think it serves them to say oh, it's apples fault that we're losing money when in fact
[01:43:58.680 --> 01:44:02.200]   It isn't apples fault. They're losing money. They're doing everything they can not to lose money
[01:44:02.200 --> 01:44:06.280]   And they still are losing money for a variety of very very good reasons
[01:44:06.600 --> 01:44:08.360]   And by the way, that is that is the truth
[01:44:08.360 --> 01:44:11.640]   They're saying because they did say it in investor calls so that is that they are
[01:44:11.640 --> 01:44:13.800]   Right well
[01:44:13.800 --> 01:44:18.840]   So they said they said that we're losing here's how we're losing an immense amount of money because of apples ad tracking
[01:44:18.840 --> 01:44:21.880]   And if they say that to you know all kinds of other situations
[01:44:21.880 --> 01:44:25.640]   You could try to tear that apart as to how they're waffling or they making this up
[01:44:25.640 --> 01:44:29.240]   Or are they really secretly not finding a way to circumvent it without losing money
[01:44:29.240 --> 01:44:35.640]   They actually said this in terms in which they are under under legal obligation to the SEC to make sure that they're not
[01:44:35.720 --> 01:44:38.440]   They're not saying anything that's untrue to their investors one more way we can get
[01:44:38.440 --> 01:44:41.080]   So yeah, but you're glad you're glad that they're feeling some pain
[01:44:41.080 --> 01:44:45.160]   You're not you're not glad that honest and decent people are my or their jobs are in danger
[01:44:45.160 --> 01:44:47.960]   But no in fact, we have lots of friends who work there
[01:44:47.960 --> 01:44:51.800]   And we love them dearly doing their best they're doing their best
[01:44:51.800 --> 01:44:55.160]   I don't blame anybody but Mark Zuckerberg. Yeah
[01:44:55.160 --> 01:45:00.520]   Uh, it's a press release, but it's still a pretty cool press release the iPad pro is
[01:45:01.320 --> 01:45:05.560]   recognizing how archaeologists preserve the ancient history of Pompeii
[01:45:05.560 --> 01:45:12.760]   LiDAR is being used much more heavily now in archaeology in fact some amazing results in the deepest
[01:45:12.760 --> 01:45:16.440]   most forested area of the Amazon they're finding
[01:45:16.440 --> 01:45:24.200]   Finding ancient ruins that are long buried using LiDAR to penetrate the ground here in uh in Pompeii
[01:45:24.200 --> 01:45:27.480]   They're using LiDAR to find
[01:45:28.280 --> 01:45:32.200]   Problem is when you do these digs you start to destroy the surroundings
[01:45:32.200 --> 01:45:36.680]   So it is an alternative to archaeological excavation
[01:45:36.680 --> 01:45:42.280]   They're doing LiDAR scanning and using the iPad pro as the kind of receiver
[01:45:42.280 --> 01:45:45.800]   Um, it's really it is it's a handheld
[01:45:45.800 --> 01:45:47.880]   You know
[01:45:47.880 --> 01:45:54.600]   Supercomputer and so that's very very cool. So good. It's a press release from apple, but documenting as much as possible. Yeah. Yeah, still cool
[01:45:55.320 --> 01:46:01.160]   Dr. Baddio knew the iPad pro with apple pencil would serve as the foundation for their work
[01:46:01.160 --> 01:46:10.280]   Uh, they're using estries suite of tools esri suite of tools as well as I think estry is a um
[01:46:10.280 --> 01:46:17.640]   A mapping uh, yeah, they're a gis company esri and they're also using uh
[01:46:17.640 --> 01:46:20.200]   Concepts by top hatch
[01:46:20.200 --> 01:46:23.320]   Let's see what concepts is sketch. Oh, yeah
[01:46:23.880 --> 01:46:26.040]   Except is cool. It's like a whiteboard
[01:46:26.040 --> 01:46:29.480]   Yeah, I think if I remember correctly, I just met somebody
[01:46:29.480 --> 01:46:32.840]   uh, so I uh, Matthew castanelli and I
[01:46:32.840 --> 01:46:39.160]   set up a uh photo walk in san francisco to test out the new iphones and so we have
[01:46:39.160 --> 01:46:44.760]   Uh, this was just over the past weekend. So we had a bunch of people. Oh, I wish I'd known about that
[01:46:44.760 --> 01:46:51.400]   Oh, you're not on twitter twitter. What's that? Uh, if you were on twitter, you would have today in your
[01:46:52.120 --> 01:46:54.120]   blue bubbles
[01:46:54.120 --> 01:46:56.120]   We went
[01:46:56.120 --> 01:46:58.600]   Go for it
[01:46:58.600 --> 01:47:03.080]   That's what that's what I always blame my lack of a social I thought oh darn darn this darn this ride
[01:47:03.080 --> 01:47:08.600]   It was on sunday. So you would have been doing that to it anyway. Yeah, but it was uh, there were
[01:47:08.600 --> 01:47:14.920]   I will say there was uh, someone who actually works on the camera app at apple who was there with us
[01:47:14.920 --> 01:47:21.160]   How cool. Yeah, they apparently no boomers were allowed. No, there were there were
[01:47:21.400 --> 01:47:27.720]   All right, okay. There was a guy. He's the dean of a school where he teaches latin to fourth graders
[01:47:27.720 --> 01:47:30.440]   Wow latin. I was like oh my god
[01:47:30.440 --> 01:47:35.720]   I get to nerd out with you about latin today as we go around and take photos of you and I they they wouldn't let us learn it until
[01:47:35.720 --> 01:47:39.480]   7th grade so you know yeah, isn't that why i'm gonna wait
[01:47:39.480 --> 01:47:42.360]   It's still the cable
[01:47:42.360 --> 01:47:46.680]   They're still using the kambridge course that I learned like huck
[01:47:47.480 --> 01:47:53.240]   Out of c's we as we as do you still remember the uh, declinations of hic hicock. Oh golly. No
[01:47:53.240 --> 01:47:56.600]   No, I was drilled there drilled into my brain. I can't
[01:47:56.600 --> 01:48:05.480]   Can't remember the christmas carol. See these chronicles. So so there you go the christmas carol's yeah, but you're a latin christmas carol
[01:48:05.480 --> 01:48:12.840]   So there's tini you tini you tintin nebula new water the like tatnos wicket heat that traheya
[01:48:14.600 --> 01:48:19.960]   Jingle bells and latin ladies and gentlemen. You just heard it here first. I don't think there's another podcast in america
[01:48:19.960 --> 01:48:25.320]   We're probably not where you would hear jingle bells and latin especially in september
[01:48:25.320 --> 01:48:31.560]   Uh anyway, so the ipad is the perfect archaeology machine says dr. Emerson
[01:48:31.560 --> 01:48:36.520]   For digging up latin christmas house. That's that's how you ever been to pompeya
[01:48:36.520 --> 01:48:41.160]   You know we were supposed to go and and and they told us you won't have time to get there traffic's terrible
[01:48:41.160 --> 01:48:44.600]   So we didn't but I really oh really I really would like to really
[01:48:44.600 --> 01:48:47.560]   And it's unbelievable
[01:48:47.560 --> 01:48:54.600]   Uh, there's still there's still digging out the city that was buried by the uh, visuvian eruption
[01:48:54.600 --> 01:48:57.400]   Back in what was it? I don't know
[01:48:57.400 --> 01:49:01.000]   50 oh that was uh a couple of years ago a couple of years ago. Yep
[01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:09.800]   Uh, the uh, there's a lot they use the line our scanner and ipad pro in combination with 3d scanner app to create three dimensional maps of trenches
[01:49:10.360 --> 01:49:16.360]   Oh, it's not that kind of light art. It's not ground penetrating light art. No, no, right? They're using the light are on the ipad
[01:49:16.360 --> 01:49:18.920]   Wow
[01:49:18.920 --> 01:49:24.440]   That's what I love about when they put hardware like that just as a commodity just in every single device
[01:49:24.440 --> 01:49:32.120]   It's nice when apple says hey look we created this the software feature that's supported by photo for uh for for uh, uh
[01:49:32.120 --> 01:49:33.800]   For depth effects for refocusing
[01:49:33.800 --> 01:49:37.240]   But when they open that stuff up to third party developers say by the way
[01:49:37.240 --> 01:49:40.840]   We have light art if you want if you can think of any ways to use it here the api's for it
[01:49:40.840 --> 01:49:43.640]   You'll find people you find developers finding
[01:49:43.640 --> 01:49:50.520]   Incredible uses for this stuff and that's adds so much value to the device when you find that app. I completely now I am impressed
[01:49:50.520 --> 01:49:56.200]   Now I am impressed. It's not the so that's what they're doing in the amazon is ground penetrating light art. This is actually
[01:49:56.200 --> 01:49:59.640]   Uh using the light art is scanned the digs
[01:49:59.640 --> 01:50:06.440]   Using and this is the app they use 3d it's great a free app from lon labs 3d scanner app lighter scanner 3d
[01:50:06.520 --> 01:50:10.680]   That's amazing. I love just when people take this technology and they run with it
[01:50:10.680 --> 01:50:15.720]   And they are doing it in such a way that you hear about these new apps that maybe you didn't even hear up
[01:50:15.720 --> 01:50:21.960]   I mean I do a show every week where we're talking about apps all the time and sometimes these come up and it's just like the brilliance of
[01:50:21.960 --> 01:50:23.720]   people
[01:50:23.720 --> 01:50:29.240]   Making use of the tools they have on hand or maybe they're a little bit aspirational the tools that they want to have on hand
[01:50:29.240 --> 01:50:35.880]   They get them and they just run with it and uh, it's so inspiring. Yeah. Yeah and also and also
[01:50:36.840 --> 01:50:39.000]   I'm really really fascinated by this idea that
[01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:45.960]   We're kind of at the transition point of like where photography might have been like in 1840 1850
[01:50:45.960 --> 01:50:51.000]   Where we know this technology exists. We don't know how well it's going to be used in the future
[01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.560]   but the thing is like
[01:50:53.560 --> 01:50:55.800]   they're there with a
[01:50:55.800 --> 01:51:00.600]   Radiance fields and earth fields and the ability to say look I have I have no idea
[01:51:00.920 --> 01:51:07.000]   What could be gained by using the light our scanner on my phone to create this really coarse 3d map
[01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:13.560]   Of what this place looked like but maybe it means that in 20 30 40 years time
[01:51:13.560 --> 01:51:19.480]   I could simply drag this file onto an app or whatever is going to be an app or in 23 the years and create
[01:51:19.480 --> 01:51:23.160]   Absolutely like 12k resolution
[01:51:23.160 --> 01:51:29.160]   240 300 frame per second virtual reality reconstruction of this
[01:51:29.560 --> 01:51:34.360]   Uh, I was thinking about that while watching the uh while watching the the the queen's funeral thinking that
[01:51:34.360 --> 01:51:39.880]   This is not being broadcast. There's not going to be a VR app or an augmented reality app that will place you here
[01:51:39.880 --> 01:51:43.480]   They're not broadcasting it that way, but it made me wonder if
[01:51:43.480 --> 01:51:50.600]   Somewhere in the planning over the past like two or three years they didn't think here is where we could put a couple of very discreet
[01:51:50.600 --> 01:51:55.480]   Lidars so that if in the future historians wanted to reconstruct this or
[01:51:56.440 --> 01:52:00.040]   Reframe this or reshoot this they would have the benefit of this data
[01:52:00.040 --> 01:52:07.720]   It's like it's like we'll put this data into a time capsule where this newspaper looks like it's useless to us today or this
[01:52:07.720 --> 01:52:12.680]   This purse that that we've recovered from that was lost 50 years ago
[01:52:12.680 --> 01:52:17.240]   It's just a purse that's just filled with common stuff that people used to carry 50 60 years ago
[01:52:17.240 --> 01:52:22.200]   If it were recovered a month later, it would just be worthless except for the cash in the pocket in the in the purse
[01:52:22.200 --> 01:52:28.440]   But 50 or 60 years ago to see no here is what a teenager at this high school would have been carrying each and every day
[01:52:28.440 --> 01:52:31.080]   Then expand that to 100 years from now 200 years from now
[01:52:31.080 --> 01:52:33.720]   So that's why it got me really really interested to think about
[01:52:33.720 --> 01:52:37.400]   If if I were one of the nerds in charge of that funeral, I'd be thinking
[01:52:37.400 --> 01:52:45.000]   What could we put in or well as part of the preparations for after the casket has been draped everything's been put on it
[01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:51.800]   Let's do as good a 3d scan of it as we can so that just as people are going to be reviewing this hd footage
[01:52:51.800 --> 01:52:57.720]   Just as people are going to be reviewing the photos if they want to review a 3d examination of this they could do that too
[01:52:57.720 --> 01:53:02.600]   That's this is the sort of thing that gets my gears going and light on every single phone and ipad
[01:53:02.600 --> 01:53:07.800]   Is definitely power is part of that engine. So now by the way, the press release is actually a great article
[01:53:07.800 --> 01:53:10.760]   They've hiring they've been hiring so many good journalists
[01:53:10.760 --> 01:53:16.920]   They doesn't have a byline. I don't think but whoever wrote it obviously has experienced writing feature articles
[01:53:16.920 --> 01:53:19.640]   uh for magazines and newspapers
[01:53:19.640 --> 01:53:24.360]   But now that i've read it and instead of just looking at the pictures because the pictures are great
[01:53:24.360 --> 01:53:31.160]   That what they've been doing is scanning as they dig so that they can reconstruct the excavation from beginning to end
[01:53:31.160 --> 01:53:34.920]   And then when they find things they scan them they have a picture of a coin
[01:53:34.920 --> 01:53:39.240]   You know vassuvius erupted 79 ad but some of the things they're finding
[01:53:39.240 --> 01:53:44.680]   Might predate that from there was an earlier earthquake and so forth and so there's a coin
[01:53:44.680 --> 01:53:48.840]   Uh that they they scan and so these will be available eventually
[01:53:49.400 --> 01:53:50.840]   online
[01:53:50.840 --> 01:53:54.040]   Uh, this is the the gold coin. It's an aureus that they found
[01:53:54.040 --> 01:53:59.640]   Uh during and and so they they actually have now been able to scan that that's from uh
[01:53:59.640 --> 01:54:02.200]   uh the year 13 or 14
[01:54:02.200 --> 01:54:04.280]   Uh
[01:54:04.280 --> 01:54:09.400]   And so eventually they're going to pretty present this at an archaeological conference
[01:54:09.400 --> 01:54:14.920]   But I would hope that at some point that put it online as well. I think that must be kind of a goal at some point
[01:54:14.920 --> 01:54:16.680]   um
[01:54:16.680 --> 01:54:21.240]   Because you've got 3d scans of of this whole excavation is very cool
[01:54:21.240 --> 01:54:22.200]   They're going to
[01:54:22.200 --> 01:54:27.000]   Present at the annual archaeological institute of america uh conference in january
[01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:31.640]   Uh, there's an entire database reflecting the uh the excavation
[01:54:31.640 --> 01:54:37.960]   Yeah, and each just think about each stuff just think about what they're doing what like this masonian is doing other other institutions
[01:54:37.960 --> 01:54:40.040]   Just basically as part of their
[01:54:40.040 --> 01:54:45.400]   Acquisition process do not only catalog it not only photograph it but also produce really good 3d scans of it
[01:54:45.400 --> 01:54:52.040]   So that at the the so many exhibits of the smithsonian where if you want your own copy of this urn that was retrieved
[01:54:52.040 --> 01:54:57.640]   Uh 50 years ago from a dig site that was uh was was overwhelmed 5 000 years ago
[01:54:57.640 --> 01:55:00.360]   Downloaded 3d printed and now you have your own copy of it
[01:55:00.360 --> 01:55:04.280]   You can hold it in your hand just as people used to hold in their hands 3 3000 years ago
[01:55:04.280 --> 01:55:06.840]   It's I never get bored with this stuff
[01:55:06.840 --> 01:55:12.280]   iOS 16.1 is on its way beta 3 has gone out to developers
[01:55:12.280 --> 01:55:14.280]   um
[01:55:14.280 --> 01:55:20.440]   iPad pro models from 2018 and newer will now be able to take advantage of stage manager
[01:55:20.440 --> 01:55:23.560]   Uh, you won't be able to do the external display
[01:55:23.560 --> 01:55:29.240]   Apples removing external supply display support for stage manager on m1 ipads
[01:55:29.240 --> 01:55:35.080]   Maybe that's some of the problems the external display one of the reasons that stage manager is slow to come out
[01:55:35.080 --> 01:55:36.680]   Um
[01:55:36.680 --> 01:55:41.720]   Apples making stage manager work with a number of older devices for the first time the 11 inch ipad pro
[01:55:42.280 --> 01:55:45.400]   12.9 inch ipad pro third generation and later
[01:55:45.400 --> 01:55:48.840]   Uh as long as you have an a 12x or a 12z chip
[01:55:48.840 --> 01:55:52.280]   As as well as the m1 you'll be able to use this
[01:55:52.280 --> 01:55:58.840]   So maybe we're making some progress to getting stage manager out apple has kind of promised it will come out with ipad os next month
[01:55:58.840 --> 01:56:01.960]   We think we don't know. Yeah, that's that's the hope
[01:56:01.960 --> 01:56:08.520]   I mean, I think now we just have to see if uh, they can iron out all of the little bugs and this seems to be
[01:56:09.240 --> 01:56:13.240]   of all of the things uh stage manager in particular seems to be
[01:56:13.240 --> 01:56:23.080]   One feature where apple is doing a bit more of a dance with the folks who are using these betas and saying things about them
[01:56:23.080 --> 01:56:25.880]   Um, the changes that I keep hearing
[01:56:25.880 --> 01:56:29.640]   Uh that are that are you know making their way into the ipad after the beta
[01:56:29.640 --> 01:56:34.120]   Are a lot of the same feedback that i've seen whenever everybody tries out a new beta
[01:56:34.200 --> 01:56:42.680]   So they seem to be listening pretty clearly on this uh and you know really sort of trying to get this right and make sure that's ready and available for people
[01:56:42.680 --> 01:56:44.200]   especially because
[01:56:44.200 --> 01:56:49.800]   There have been some um issues with the uh with ios
[01:56:49.800 --> 01:56:53.720]   Uh in in the first rollout we've got that 16.0.1
[01:56:53.720 --> 01:56:59.240]   But then we just recently got 16.0.2 and there were all of these issues including one that lisa experienced
[01:56:59.240 --> 01:57:01.560]   What was that?
[01:57:01.560 --> 01:57:02.440]   Um
[01:57:02.440 --> 01:57:07.480]   Her it was uh when she did the restore her phone wouldn't start. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah
[01:57:07.480 --> 01:57:10.040]   We should mention that one more time
[01:57:10.040 --> 01:57:11.800]   Um
[01:57:11.800 --> 01:57:14.760]   Actually, I don't know if we mentioned it last week. So lisa
[01:57:14.760 --> 01:57:19.640]   Did we mention this last week or did we talk about it? We talked about it. Yeah, we talked about it on the tech guy
[01:57:19.640 --> 01:57:22.040]   Yep, that's why I feel like i've talked about this so
[01:57:22.040 --> 01:57:24.280]   There are
[01:57:24.280 --> 01:57:28.680]   Three at least ways to migrate from an old iphone to a new iphone
[01:57:29.240 --> 01:57:36.120]   You and i mica did the kind of easy and obvious thing which was uh put the two of them side by side
[01:57:36.120 --> 01:57:38.520]   Uh, which then
[01:57:38.520 --> 01:57:43.480]   Paired the sim moved the sim over and then it gives you the choice to restore from icloud
[01:57:43.480 --> 01:57:46.760]   Or copy while they're sitting side by side and you and i
[01:57:46.760 --> 01:57:49.880]   Reasonably, I think decided to use the icloud backup
[01:57:49.880 --> 01:57:51.560]   lisa did
[01:57:51.560 --> 01:57:55.880]   What john groobber recommended last year which was used the the phone to phone backup
[01:57:56.200 --> 01:57:59.240]   I always thought that's got to be slower. You have to be on the same wi-fi network
[01:57:59.240 --> 01:58:03.560]   But you know i worked actually really fast for her. She did it. She went to bed
[01:58:03.560 --> 01:58:08.680]   Uh saturday night. I think it was her friday night. She got the phone of friday. So you have friday or saturday night
[01:58:08.680 --> 01:58:10.120]   Uh
[01:58:10.120 --> 01:58:14.040]   With the process begun woke up to a dead iphone 14 pro max
[01:58:14.040 --> 01:58:17.640]   Like nothing no on off switch nothing blank screen
[01:58:17.640 --> 01:58:20.360]   Actually, she woke up to it at three in the morning and
[01:58:21.560 --> 01:58:25.480]   Said hey, hey said hey, what's wrong? That's it. I don't know. Can we do it in the morning?
[01:58:25.480 --> 01:58:32.200]   No, it's she was she told me later. She never went back to sleep. She was like so upset that her new brand new phone was dead
[01:58:32.200 --> 01:58:34.760]   But to her credit
[01:58:34.760 --> 01:58:38.600]   Before the tech i woke up the next morning she went online and found a youtube video
[01:58:38.600 --> 01:58:42.360]   That said oh, yeah, just do the full reset and they'll come back to life
[01:58:42.360 --> 01:58:48.360]   So that's the volume up volume down and then press and hold the screen on off key till you see the apple
[01:58:48.680 --> 01:58:55.240]   And it came back to life. Everything was fine. So this is apparently a known bug with the phone to phone upgrade
[01:58:55.240 --> 01:58:57.800]   Yes, and there's also another one where
[01:58:57.800 --> 01:59:03.400]   Folks who are charging their specifically with the pro models when folks are charging their pro models
[01:59:03.400 --> 01:59:08.280]   It will get between 90 and 95 charged a lot of times it seems to be at 93
[01:59:08.280 --> 01:59:11.480]   In particular and then the phone will just hard reset
[01:59:11.480 --> 01:59:18.120]   And the apple support this is what i was talking about earlier apple supporters said a whole number of things including
[01:59:18.280 --> 01:59:22.280]   Some that makes sense like uh restoring the phone from dfu mode will help
[01:59:22.280 --> 01:59:25.080]   Restoring the mo the phone from restore mode will help
[01:59:25.080 --> 01:59:30.840]   But some there was one uh support person who said delete the ufi app on your phone
[01:59:30.840 --> 01:59:34.040]   You fit right what i don't get it
[01:59:34.040 --> 01:59:39.720]   The the other one was and what ended up working for this person. Oh the ufi app did i fix it
[01:59:39.720 --> 01:59:45.160]   No, that was just random that was they they thought that that could be causing the problem for some reason
[01:59:45.160 --> 01:59:50.680]   I don't know the context of it unfortunately, but I thought I can't be on page 35 of your binder you'll find it
[01:59:50.680 --> 01:59:53.000]   Right footnotes
[01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:56.840]   Says perhaps uh so what ended up working for the person
[01:59:56.840 --> 02:00:01.560]   Like excuse me was um turning off background app refresh
[02:00:01.560 --> 02:00:04.280]   All of their apps
[02:00:04.280 --> 02:00:08.360]   And that's just not something that should be like you should not need to do that for it to work
[02:00:08.360 --> 02:00:09.560]   So
[02:00:09.560 --> 02:00:13.480]   This is uh something that I think apple will end up addressing in the next
[02:00:13.800 --> 02:00:19.880]   uh iteration as well as we continue to see these little things the 16.0.2 update fixed the
[02:00:19.880 --> 02:00:28.040]   optical image stabilization rattle that some people were experiencing on their product and snapchat. Yeah, yeah, yeah, so um
[02:00:28.040 --> 02:00:30.840]   This is a harder one to fix because
[02:00:30.840 --> 02:00:36.280]   You could fix it from from now if you figure out what's going on by putting newer uh
[02:00:36.280 --> 02:00:40.600]   Operating system or a fixed operating system on the phone, but all those phones that are
[02:00:41.320 --> 02:00:46.600]   In the stores that have been shipped out. This is this is they all you can't fix the bug. You know retroactively
[02:00:46.600 --> 02:00:48.600]   uh lisa
[02:00:48.600 --> 02:00:52.120]   Found uh a youtube video so we'll give credit to that
[02:00:52.120 --> 02:00:53.880]   um
[02:00:53.880 --> 02:00:59.880]   youtube I had a fixed frozen black screen after data transfer by web pro education
[02:00:59.880 --> 02:01:05.000]   And uh this two-minute video walked her through it and it worked for an american our chat room
[02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:08.120]   Told me a couple of days ago kiss lisa for me now
[02:01:08.200 --> 02:01:13.000]   Now I know why he said it because it it was he had the same problem and it fixed it yes
[02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.480]   Uh for her so not good
[02:01:15.480 --> 02:01:18.200]   But at least you know
[02:01:18.200 --> 02:01:21.480]   If you're doing a day at transferring a phone to phone transfer
[02:01:21.480 --> 02:01:26.600]   Uh and it goes black that's how you do it. You do a reset. I would have I would have probably tried that
[02:01:26.600 --> 02:01:31.080]   Had I been awake. Yeah, you and I definitely would have I thought when I got up
[02:01:31.080 --> 02:01:36.520]   I said um I might have to do a dfu which is one step even further down the road, but no the reset the reset worked fine
[02:01:38.040 --> 02:01:43.160]   So this is what it looks like when you have the transfer complete on your old phone and nothing
[02:01:43.160 --> 02:01:47.400]   You're on your new phone. I think it's only iphone pros
[02:01:47.400 --> 02:01:51.320]   14 pros, right? Yes. Um, in fact all of these issues
[02:01:51.320 --> 02:01:55.640]   Any of the ones that have been reported so far have all been pro models and I don't know if that's just
[02:01:55.640 --> 02:01:59.160]   This is this is the problem. It could be a selection error
[02:01:59.160 --> 02:02:04.600]   I think is the proper term here because people with pros are more likely to be people who have like twitter accounts
[02:02:04.600 --> 02:02:06.600]   And so they're talking more about it. Yeah
[02:02:06.600 --> 02:02:09.720]   I'm getting picked up by that. You know what I mean? So it could be that the non pros are having it
[02:02:09.720 --> 02:02:14.200]   And we just don't know it but as far as that goes, that seems to be the case rosemary
[02:02:14.200 --> 02:02:20.280]   Had an interesting issue with her her air pods per second generation the first one she got
[02:02:20.280 --> 02:02:25.480]   Um, you know normally that when you get a new apple device or any device that has a rechargeable battery
[02:02:25.480 --> 02:02:30.840]   They typically come around 50 to 60 charge because that's how you're meant to store those batteries
[02:02:30.840 --> 02:02:34.920]   So she got her air pods pro she opened them and they didn't do anything and so she thought
[02:02:34.920 --> 02:02:38.040]   Oh, this must just be one of those rare times where the battery didn't come charged
[02:02:38.040 --> 02:02:44.200]   She plugged it in for an hour and a half and came back and it still wasn't doing anything wasn't lighting up nothing
[02:02:44.200 --> 02:02:49.080]   And tried a whole bunch of different things. Of course, there's not a whole lot of interaction
[02:02:49.080 --> 02:02:50.760]   You can do it in your buds pro
[02:02:50.760 --> 02:02:54.280]   So she ended up having to take them in they had a the battery was just bad
[02:02:54.280 --> 02:02:57.800]   And so she had to get a new pair, but there were plenty in stock. So she was able to get one
[02:02:57.800 --> 02:03:01.480]   But I think it's worth saying to folks who are listening
[02:03:01.480 --> 02:03:04.040]   Um, I remember rene ritchie telling me this
[02:03:04.680 --> 02:03:09.000]   And especially with new device launches if you're having any issues
[02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:13.400]   Always feel free or always feel encouraged even to reach out to apple
[02:03:13.400 --> 02:03:18.680]   And if you have apple stores nearby go in to do that because they are trying to capture
[02:03:18.680 --> 02:03:26.680]   All sorts of devices that do have errors and issues so that they can you know, may iron that out in the manufacturing and ongoing process
[02:03:26.680 --> 02:03:29.160]   Uh, so it's well worth, you know
[02:03:29.160 --> 02:03:31.320]   Making sure your phone is exactly how you want it
[02:03:31.800 --> 02:03:36.440]   Because they want to make that the case too and also find those devices that are misbehaving and see if it's a
[02:03:36.440 --> 02:03:43.080]   You know a trend. Yeah, it's not just it's not just if devices are misbehaving even if you drop it and you break the screen
[02:03:43.080 --> 02:03:46.520]   You never there's sometimes our hunting hunting list
[02:03:46.520 --> 02:03:51.160]   They're basically saying look if so if they come in we we want two examples of phones with broken screens
[02:03:51.160 --> 02:03:56.200]   So we want to know how well these things are are stepping up. So yes, you absolutely drop it on your own
[02:03:56.200 --> 02:03:58.520]   Yes, you screwed up. No, it's not covered by warranty
[02:03:58.760 --> 02:04:02.680]   But they might just give you a new one because again kuberkino engineers are saying
[02:04:02.680 --> 02:04:09.880]   Please please capture as many of these devices as possible with the following specific problems because we definitely want to take a look at how well
[02:04:09.880 --> 02:04:11.960]   People are using new things
[02:04:11.960 --> 02:04:15.000]   Uh apple tv news
[02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:20.920]   apple and opra are going their separate ways the last opra project was the sindy pwati
[02:04:20.920 --> 02:04:24.040]   Documentary which just appeared on apple tv
[02:04:24.520 --> 02:04:28.280]   It was a multi-year deal sign in 2018, but the contract has run
[02:04:28.280 --> 02:04:34.920]   I guess they're there there's parting ways, you know, but they still have mutual respect for one another
[02:04:34.920 --> 02:04:37.800]   And I think this is a big story
[02:04:37.800 --> 02:04:42.920]   Uh vint skill again, of course the creator of breaking bad and better call saw
[02:04:42.920 --> 02:04:46.200]   Has mo is moving from a emc
[02:04:46.200 --> 02:04:51.000]   To apple tv plus they have landed his new tv project
[02:04:51.480 --> 02:04:57.720]   Two season order and it stars ria sehorn who is absolutely wonderful and better call saw
[02:04:57.720 --> 02:05:03.240]   Uh, so i'm really glad to see it's not going to be a breaking bad universe
[02:05:03.240 --> 02:05:09.640]   Uh show in fact, it's not even expected to be involved the underworld of drugs and crime at all
[02:05:09.640 --> 02:05:17.080]   So I don't know is it a sitcom it's a I don't know what this means a grounded genre drama
[02:05:18.520 --> 02:05:21.400]   Wow grounded drama and say that five times fast
[02:05:21.400 --> 02:05:27.240]   Yeah, but any any drama coming up vint skill again plus ria sehorn perfect as so
[02:05:27.240 --> 02:05:31.160]   That's like she for anybody who didn't watch better call saw
[02:05:31.160 --> 02:05:35.800]   I think she is the the the way that she performed the role that was written for her
[02:05:35.800 --> 02:05:42.520]   Is the reason why better call saw was previewed with people thinking? Oh, so the wacky out there outlandish
[02:05:42.520 --> 02:05:46.760]   Is going to be sort of like a comedy drama where they see the hijinks
[02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:52.840]   Which turned it into I think the relationship that they wrote between ria sehorn and uh and bob
[02:05:52.840 --> 02:05:58.760]   Oden cork kirk is what turned it into something as good as as impactful as breaking bad if not more so
[02:05:58.760 --> 02:06:02.200]   So yeah, that's super super exciting. It's like if I
[02:06:02.200 --> 02:06:05.480]   I've no I've no skin in this game because I do have the package
[02:06:05.480 --> 02:06:11.800]   I have got apple tv plus anyway, but this is the sort of thing that would have gotten me to say maybe I should sample apple tv plus
[02:06:11.800 --> 02:06:16.360]   Cause I don't want to not see that thing. Oh severance is so good. I know you love ted lasso
[02:06:16.920 --> 02:06:19.160]   Yeah, um, do you see do you see the good stuff?
[02:06:19.160 --> 02:06:21.400]   Yeah, did you see the the latest?
[02:06:21.400 --> 02:06:26.120]   Ted lasso is now going to be a playable character in fifa 2023
[02:06:26.120 --> 02:06:31.720]   As well as as well as richmond is going to be a playable club with all of the characters as players
[02:06:31.720 --> 02:06:34.040]   The fictional club richmond
[02:06:34.040 --> 02:06:41.000]   Uh, which is from the ted lasso game, uh, and he is a player or a coach. He is no it's a it's a team
[02:06:41.160 --> 02:06:47.080]   It's it's a team that's playable in fiva 2023. So yes, he is the coach of the team that got capture of sude
[02:06:47.080 --> 02:06:51.320]   Cause they also got capture of like the actual actor. They got Roy. Do they have Roy?
[02:06:51.320 --> 02:06:55.960]   Yep. Yep. At the end of this clip at the end of this clip, they have some gameplay footage

[02:07:10.920 --> 02:07:14.600]   That game just because of that
[02:07:14.600 --> 02:07:17.240]   That's awesome
[02:07:17.240 --> 02:07:22.840]   Also because now i'm i'm happy because I know that somewhere there's motion caption of jason sude
[02:07:22.840 --> 02:07:27.560]   Because do it like cabbage patching because we have we haven't seen him like on we haven't seen him on
[02:07:27.560 --> 02:07:32.440]   Ted lasso doing that except for like quote archival video footage of when his college team won
[02:07:32.440 --> 02:07:37.720]   But you know that that's one of his celebration moves as coach in this game. That's gotta be that is a brilliant
[02:07:37.960 --> 02:07:46.040]   promotional move on the part of fifa sucker is that electronic arts probably uh, what a what a great great move. Wow
[02:07:46.040 --> 02:07:49.400]   I hope they're a wonderful team

[02:07:56.840 --> 02:07:59.560]   Uh
[02:07:59.560 --> 02:08:06.120]   Anything else going on that we want to talk about i'm looking at the things you guys added
[02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:11.160]   Um, I think we've covered everything that was in our rundown for the day, which means
[02:08:11.160 --> 02:08:15.000]   If you will prepare yourselves our picks of the week are
[02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:19.320]   Imminent before we do I want to put in a plug you may have noticed
[02:08:19.320 --> 02:08:21.880]   You know because you're you're that way
[02:08:21.880 --> 02:08:24.440]   Uh that there was only one ad on this show
[02:08:24.440 --> 02:08:26.920]   Uh, and that was a house ad so
[02:08:26.920 --> 02:08:30.360]   You may have thought boy. I wonder what's going on. Well
[02:08:30.360 --> 02:08:33.960]   As you may have also noticed times are tough all over the world
[02:08:34.440 --> 02:08:41.000]   And uh, that means podcasting is getting a little tight as well a lot of our advertisers pulling back on their budgets and so forth
[02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:45.800]   Means we need to rely more and more on our club. Thank goodness
[02:08:45.800 --> 02:08:52.280]   Club twit exists. It is very easy for you to afford less than seven bucks a month
[02:08:52.280 --> 02:08:58.680]   What do you get ad-free versions of every show you wouldn't even hear this in the ad-free versions of the show
[02:08:59.160 --> 02:09:07.960]   You also get of course access to the twit plus discord, which is my frankly favorite new social network not only chatting about the shows
[02:09:07.960 --> 02:09:14.680]   Uh, but also, uh chatting about every other thing the geeks are interested in all around
[02:09:14.680 --> 02:09:18.520]   And full of animated gifs for your enjoyment
[02:09:18.520 --> 02:09:23.560]   Uh, and we do events in the club too stacy's book club is in the club the ultimate
[02:09:23.560 --> 02:09:26.760]   Uh, i'm sorry the untitled linux show, which is the ultimate linux show
[02:09:27.240 --> 02:09:32.280]   So the club is a great way to participate in shows we're preparing for the future
[02:09:32.280 --> 02:09:39.720]   That's how this week in space was born shows that are exclusive to the club like mica earso hands-on mac, which is fantastic
[02:09:39.720 --> 02:09:43.800]   We do put occasional versions of that out for the for free
[02:09:43.800 --> 02:09:47.400]   Just so people get a taste of it same with apolthorot's hands on windows
[02:09:47.400 --> 02:09:52.680]   Uh, the untitled linux show stacy hingham botham's book club dikti bartoelos gizfiz
[02:09:53.400 --> 02:09:58.680]   All of them club only they appear on the twit plus feed along with extra content that doesn't make it into the podcast
[02:09:58.680 --> 02:10:02.760]   So I think we've made a bundle of very I think useful
[02:10:02.760 --> 02:10:09.720]   Uh content for you for just seven bucks a month. You can subscribe to any individual show ad free just one show for 299
[02:10:09.720 --> 02:10:14.680]   But all of that's explained at the website twit.tv/club twit
[02:10:14.680 --> 02:10:18.680]   We really uh, I think want to put a push on over the next few months
[02:10:18.680 --> 02:10:22.360]   To get everybody who listens to the shows to a join club twit
[02:10:22.760 --> 02:10:26.840]   Um, if you can I know seven bucks a month for some people's it's a it's a stretch
[02:10:26.840 --> 02:10:32.040]   But if you can it's going to make a big difference for us as we head into a
[02:10:32.040 --> 02:10:35.480]   Recession and a difficult I think a difficult 2023
[02:10:35.480 --> 02:10:41.960]   Makes it makes a big difference to have that steady income. So twit.tv/club twit
[02:10:41.960 --> 02:10:46.760]   I really thank you and appreciate it to all our club twit members. Thank you
[02:10:46.760 --> 02:10:51.080]   Uh, even though you're not hearing this because you're a member club twit. All right now
[02:10:51.960 --> 02:10:56.760]   Time for the pick of the week andi and not go. Why don't you kick the pick off?
[02:10:56.760 --> 02:11:03.400]   Mine is a really cool site archive that people people should have on their radar just this month the steve jobs family
[02:11:03.400 --> 02:11:12.520]   Introduce the steve jobs archive is at steve jobs archive.com and it's designated to be combination a central point for
[02:11:12.520 --> 02:11:13.560]   uh
[02:11:13.560 --> 02:11:18.440]   humanitarian and social efforts that are going to be undertaken under their their
[02:11:19.320 --> 02:11:23.640]   under their their trust and foundation, but also a place where they're going to be posting
[02:11:23.640 --> 02:11:26.520]   archival files
[02:11:26.520 --> 02:11:32.040]   emails documents that related to steve jobs life and history and they started off with a bunch of
[02:11:32.040 --> 02:11:36.840]   Of stuff at the very very top of the list is an email that he sent to himself as a reminder
[02:11:36.840 --> 02:11:42.120]   Of basically what life is all about and if this is what's if this is what we're going to be seeing from this site
[02:11:42.120 --> 02:11:49.160]   You need to subscribe to the RSS feed you need a book market because it looks like the start of what's going to be a very very interesting
[02:11:49.640 --> 02:11:50.760]   ongoing
[02:11:50.760 --> 02:11:52.760]   Ongoing site. I've always said that
[02:11:52.760 --> 02:11:54.200]   steve
[02:11:54.200 --> 02:11:59.640]   Supposedly was very anti-history at least at apple. He wasn't all about hey, let's have a let's have a museum
[02:11:59.640 --> 02:12:04.680]   Hey, let's have a let's let's honor. What have we been doing in the past? Let's document and release stuff
[02:12:04.680 --> 02:12:11.400]   and that's too bad because apple has been a big big part of a whole bunch of different aspects of
[02:12:11.400 --> 02:12:17.480]   Cultural and technological history it needs to be documented so that it can illuminate and inspire other people
[02:12:17.640 --> 02:12:23.480]   So it makes me happy to see that some of his own personal archives and personal documents and comments and notes to himself
[02:12:23.480 --> 02:12:29.480]   Are in fact going to be made published where they can illuminate instruct and uh and uh uplift other people
[02:12:29.480 --> 02:12:35.880]   Very nice steve jobs archive.com. Yeah, that was the occasion of tim cook johnny
[02:12:35.880 --> 02:12:41.000]   I've and laurine pal jobs all appearing on the stage with kara swisher at the dea conference
[02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:43.800]   Um, right. It was right after the apple effect
[02:12:44.360 --> 02:12:50.760]   Uh and they announced this so yeah, I think it's a really great thing to have uh and I hope more and more stuff appears there frankly
[02:12:50.760 --> 02:12:55.880]   Yeah, I think I think that video has actually recently been posted least it's recently turned up about subscriptions
[02:12:55.880 --> 02:13:01.560]   So if you want to see the entire unedited on stage like an hour and a half long that's also a pretty good watch
[02:13:01.560 --> 02:13:02.920]   Nice
[02:13:02.920 --> 02:13:07.240]   Mike a sergeant you don't usually get to do pics of the week with us you do them all the time of course on
[02:13:07.240 --> 02:13:09.400]   Ios today
[02:13:09.400 --> 02:13:11.480]   Do you have something for us today?
[02:13:11.480 --> 02:13:18.920]   I do uh, so the app is pronounced snapper, but it's spelled x n a snapper snapper
[02:13:18.920 --> 02:13:26.040]   But they there's so because I I used to pronounce it snapper and then they added this little sub line to their
[02:13:26.040 --> 02:13:30.840]   The website that says read like snapper. I'm like, oh, I get it now
[02:13:30.840 --> 02:13:33.080]   So what does it do?
[02:13:33.080 --> 02:13:39.400]   This is a this is an app for folks who take screenshots and like to post to them places
[02:13:39.400 --> 02:13:44.680]   Which is something that I do rather frequently as I'm helping people with questions they have or I'm showing
[02:13:44.680 --> 02:13:50.440]   That zoom keeps serving up ads on my paid account even though I should not be getting ads on my paid account
[02:13:50.440 --> 02:13:53.480]   Anyway, that's a decide and so I could take screenshots
[02:13:53.480 --> 02:13:58.040]   And this lets you add sort of a pleasing background to them
[02:13:58.040 --> 02:14:01.960]   But it also has these smart features where if you take a screenshot that's a little wonky
[02:14:01.960 --> 02:14:07.560]   You can use the balance button and it figures out. Oh, this is the content that you're trying to show
[02:14:07.880 --> 02:14:12.360]   The rest of this is just background it can then sort of position it in the center
[02:14:12.360 --> 02:14:15.000]   And then make the the background larger or smaller
[02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:23.640]   You can redact text automatically and what I love too is that it has all of the different social media image sizes built into it
[02:14:23.640 --> 02:14:25.880]   So you can very quickly create
[02:14:25.880 --> 02:14:28.920]   The perfect screenshot so that it posts at full
[02:14:28.920 --> 02:14:33.720]   Size on twitter or if you're posting to instagram facebook pinterest etc
[02:14:34.120 --> 02:14:38.600]   All of those are what are there as well and it's got a built-in watermarking feature
[02:14:38.600 --> 02:14:42.600]   So it is I use a different tool for a more
[02:14:42.600 --> 02:14:46.680]   Basic screen shotting but when I want to take a screenshot
[02:14:46.680 --> 02:14:52.920]   And then just post it in a way that looks good and will work on the specific site that I'm using
[02:14:52.920 --> 02:14:56.920]   Snapper is the new one that I really like and I would recommend this
[02:14:56.920 --> 02:15:03.400]   Um, of course, you know, maybe you just want this app on its own you can get it for uh, 30 dollars as a one-time purchase
[02:15:03.800 --> 02:15:09.400]   But the real value I feel is by getting it as part of a set app subscription
[02:15:09.400 --> 02:15:14.200]   Uh, because when you do then you get access to a bunch of other fantastic mac apps that are available
[02:15:14.200 --> 02:15:19.080]   And there's you know dozens of them, but yeah, this is snapper
[02:15:19.080 --> 02:15:24.840]   And it just does a great job of uh making screenshots that look good
[02:15:24.840 --> 02:15:28.760]   Z. I'm sorry x n a p p e r
[02:15:28.760 --> 02:15:31.400]   Yes snapper
[02:15:31.400 --> 02:15:33.400]   Snapper got shot
[02:15:34.200 --> 02:15:40.440]   I have a other website actually actually says underneath it x napper read like snapper
[02:15:40.440 --> 02:15:42.920]   Yeah, they're very clear
[02:15:42.920 --> 02:15:47.640]   And sometimes you have to explain it's spelled to it, but it's pronounced char day
[02:15:47.640 --> 02:15:50.200]   uh
[02:15:50.200 --> 02:15:51.880]   bouquet
[02:15:51.880 --> 02:15:53.880]   President's
[02:15:53.880 --> 02:15:56.200]   I as you know, I have a problem
[02:15:56.200 --> 02:16:03.080]   Um, I will uh wake up in the middle of the night and start scrolling through my instagram feed and end up buying weird
[02:16:03.080 --> 02:16:04.600]   underwear
[02:16:04.600 --> 02:16:06.680]   I stopped using instagram because
[02:16:06.680 --> 02:16:10.840]   The ads were too good too good plus. I don't want to support facebook
[02:16:10.840 --> 02:16:13.560]   Well along comes the og app now
[02:16:13.560 --> 02:16:18.120]   This is brand new and I can't imagine they're going to be able to continue doing this very long
[02:16:18.120 --> 02:16:26.120]   So you might want to download it right now. Uh, it's on uh, uh, the ios uh store as well as the android google play store
[02:16:26.120 --> 02:16:28.920]   It is instagram without the ads
[02:16:28.920 --> 02:16:32.920]   without uh, it's without the algorithm
[02:16:33.400 --> 02:16:36.440]   It's just the people you follow it's kind of instagram
[02:16:36.440 --> 02:16:41.080]   It's og the old school instagram their instagram the residual gangster
[02:16:41.080 --> 02:16:46.040]   Let me show you if you have the over the shoulder shot. This is my instagram feed on the og app
[02:16:46.040 --> 02:16:51.240]   And it looks just like my instagram feed. It's even got the reels up at the top
[02:16:51.240 --> 02:16:54.280]   Uh, I can like I can comment
[02:16:54.280 --> 02:17:00.120]   The one thing as far as I can tell you I can't do is post and I which means it's taking advantage of instagram's web
[02:17:00.760 --> 02:17:04.920]   Uh, api to download this but just no ads alone
[02:17:04.920 --> 02:17:11.480]   For me makes instagram suddenly this great thing because you're free writing completely on facebook's service
[02:17:11.480 --> 02:17:15.320]   Uh, which means I think at some point facebook's going to do something about this
[02:17:15.320 --> 02:17:17.880]   But until they do
[02:17:17.880 --> 02:17:21.480]   Hallelujah, it's og instagram
[02:17:21.480 --> 02:17:24.040]   Just search for the og app
[02:17:24.040 --> 02:17:28.040]   In the app store the the developers of the app seem
[02:17:28.760 --> 02:17:34.440]   Rather optimistic about things when they were asked about it. They're like, uh, we don't see any changes coming to instagram api
[02:17:34.440 --> 02:17:36.840]   This should be fine. Yeah, it's uh, I
[02:17:36.840 --> 02:17:42.840]   I heard about this app this morning and downloaded it and uh, i love it as well. It's like, oh, it's and I was
[02:17:42.840 --> 02:17:46.360]   Impressed that they were able to still get the reels showing and everything else
[02:17:46.360 --> 02:17:51.480]   Um, so yeah, I'm impressed with it. I do wish that you could post from it, but I understand why well
[02:17:51.480 --> 02:17:53.800]   I think that's not in the api which is
[02:17:55.080 --> 02:18:02.040]   I you know instagram has a web interface, you know, you can go to instagram.com and I think it's that's kind of maybe where they're getting
[02:18:02.040 --> 02:18:03.800]   This from
[02:18:03.800 --> 02:18:09.400]   Uh, which maybe it means that instagram won't kill it because they they want people to do this the creators
[02:18:09.400 --> 02:18:12.440]   Uh, anch nanda and hardic patil
[02:18:12.440 --> 02:18:14.920]   Uh have some money
[02:18:14.920 --> 02:18:19.960]   Um because they have had previous successes in the app store. So
[02:18:20.520 --> 02:18:23.720]   Um, they they their company uni feed published the og app
[02:18:23.720 --> 02:18:25.640]   they um
[02:18:25.640 --> 02:18:30.600]   They they met while working at kirana card a grocery delivery app. You may know it better zepto
[02:18:30.600 --> 02:18:33.480]   Which raised i swear you're just speaking
[02:18:33.480 --> 02:18:36.360]   All these names
[02:18:36.360 --> 02:18:40.760]   You know, I know that he was only in the first two marks brothers movies, but oh, yeah
[02:18:40.760 --> 02:18:46.760]   He made a bigger contribution to most people say, uh, they had raised 200 million dollars in may so
[02:18:47.560 --> 02:18:51.400]   They're gonna be around it has a lot of features that are great
[02:18:51.400 --> 02:18:57.240]   You can even and this is something that doesn't work very well on instagram follow subject matter
[02:18:57.240 --> 02:18:59.240]   so uh
[02:18:59.240 --> 02:19:04.760]   You can create alternative feeds and share them with your friends for food or whatever, you know, you're interested in
[02:19:04.760 --> 02:19:08.360]   Uh without following those accounts kind of like twitter lists
[02:19:08.360 --> 02:19:11.080]   Oh, that's neat. Yeah
[02:19:11.080 --> 02:19:14.600]   Now can I can I enter a practical question at this point? Yes
[02:19:15.160 --> 02:19:20.680]   On a scale of one to 100 what are the chances that this is just a scam to get people's login credentials
[02:19:20.680 --> 02:19:24.840]   It uses the api so you use the oauth, um, you are
[02:19:24.840 --> 02:19:32.520]   So they don't see it. I hope not. I mean, I guess they could we don't know I love i love i love humanity
[02:19:32.520 --> 02:19:34.680]   I suspect people it is it does
[02:19:34.680 --> 02:19:39.640]   To an instagram and instagram page where you log in and then authorize it, but
[02:19:39.640 --> 02:19:41.000]   Okay, so it doesn't see you
[02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:45.960]   Checked this morning when I was using it to make sure it was truly the instagram site and all that kind of stuff
[02:19:45.960 --> 02:19:52.280]   Um, but I was I'm with you, uh, Andy in terms of I was I was skeptical about that too and a little worried at first
[02:19:52.280 --> 02:19:58.600]   But once I saw that it was using that form of login as opposed to just type in your user name and password here
[02:19:58.600 --> 02:20:02.920]   I would have said now i'm not doing that. Yeah. Yeah, so maybe just you know consider
[02:20:02.920 --> 02:20:07.640]   Maybe wait a little bit see I mean apple approved it. That's a good sign, right?
[02:20:08.440 --> 02:20:12.680]   Well, it has you know, I'm here in the google play store. It has over 100 downloads
[02:20:12.680 --> 02:20:17.560]   It's brand new folks. I know I know that means that that means that could be thousands
[02:20:17.560 --> 02:20:22.840]   They just have one up. Okay, but it's like okay. No, that skepticism. I think is important. It is a fair
[02:20:22.840 --> 02:20:24.200]   point
[02:20:24.200 --> 02:20:29.960]   Only reason I did is because once I saw they were making use of the official api and the only way to log in was through that
[02:20:29.960 --> 02:20:34.200]   Easily revocable option where they don't ever get access to your actual credentials
[02:20:34.200 --> 02:20:39.320]   Right. I was fine, but it was annoying that then when I went to the instagram app after that
[02:20:39.320 --> 02:20:43.480]   Um, I got all these prompts about you've logged in from a different thing
[02:20:43.480 --> 02:20:47.800]   We need to confirm that it's actually you can you tell us uh check if this is still your phone number if it's still your phone number
[02:20:47.800 --> 02:20:52.760]   We're gonna send you a code. Oh, is this still the email that you're you it made me do this whole security check out just to get back in
[02:20:52.760 --> 02:20:56.200]   Just another reason not to use the Instagram app, huh? Yeah, exactly
[02:20:56.200 --> 02:20:59.080]   I guess you have to if you want to post
[02:20:59.720 --> 02:21:04.600]   Micah, thank you for filling in on short notice for Alex Lindsey. He had to go and do some work
[02:21:04.600 --> 02:21:12.920]   That which does happen from time to time mike is the host of iOS today with rosemary orchard a must-see podcast if you use iphones or ipads
[02:21:12.920 --> 02:21:20.200]   Or I guess teav apple tv and apple watches as well. Yeah, all sorts of stuff everything but macOS I guess
[02:21:20.200 --> 02:21:22.920]   Yeah, we should call it
[02:21:22.920 --> 02:21:28.520]   Everything but mac how are you doing that weather display behind you is that a what is that?
[02:21:29.080 --> 02:21:31.720]   Oh, this is one of the most common questions I get
[02:21:31.720 --> 02:21:36.360]   This is called the tid bite t i d b y te
[02:21:36.360 --> 02:21:42.280]   And it is a really cool programmable led display. Oh, sorry. There's no e on the end. Oh, my apologies
[02:21:42.280 --> 02:21:44.680]   t i d b y t dot com
[02:21:44.680 --> 02:21:49.880]   Um, and it is yeah a little led display that you can add personal
[02:21:49.880 --> 02:21:51.240]   Um
[02:21:51.240 --> 02:21:57.640]   The coding like you can you can make your own little apps and applets. I did a little clock that was personal at night
[02:21:57.640 --> 02:22:02.680]   It shows the moon phases the phases of the moon over the next coming days. There's a chihuahua
[02:22:02.680 --> 02:22:06.600]   So obviously I had to buy it um, but it does a lot of fun stuff
[02:22:06.600 --> 02:22:08.520]   I'm gonna get this
[02:22:08.520 --> 02:22:09.640]   Yeah, I
[02:22:09.640 --> 02:22:14.040]   Everybody who's asked me then when I tell them where it is like oh I got it and I love it. It's so fun
[02:22:14.040 --> 02:22:21.560]   I asked him a while back. Now 179 bucks. Okay. Yeah, I have the law metric which is very similar, but it's a smaller display
[02:22:21.560 --> 02:22:27.160]   And it looks like not quite as programmable. So that's kind of that's very cool. I use Wi-Fi. I presume
[02:22:27.800 --> 02:22:32.680]   Yes, this looks like an eight-foot project that I keep telling myself. Oh, I should buy that panel and I should buy a teen scene
[02:22:32.680 --> 02:22:36.760]   I should then realize that it would probably it would take me a year to finally get around to it
[02:22:36.760 --> 02:22:40.840]   And then it would be half-butted and maybe I should just give these people a very reasonable amount of money
[02:22:40.840 --> 02:22:44.600]   That's not that much more than what it would cost for me to build it myself. It looks nice
[02:22:44.600 --> 02:22:48.120]   Thank you. Yeah, and it's so fun to make little projects with it
[02:22:48.120 --> 02:22:51.480]   It was kind of my encouragement to do a little bit of coding as well. So
[02:22:52.520 --> 02:22:59.160]   Well, I see open ecosystem right your own apps flash run firmware. Oh, yeah, I mean, you can actually better display
[02:22:59.160 --> 02:23:02.840]   Yeah, even yeah, it's better than I you know would have thought
[02:23:02.840 --> 02:23:07.480]   Andy and I co when are you gonna be on GBH in Boston next?
[02:23:07.480 --> 02:23:15.080]   I'm on a day early this week. I'm on Thursday at 1245 go to wgph news.org to

[02:23:22.840 --> 02:23:29.320]   I wish I wish they hadn't switched to added a youtube channel because now this another thing I actually have to shave and dress for

[02:23:35.720 --> 02:23:41.320]   For at least at least at least when i'm on friday's i'm in the library studios least I get to be in the library and that's
[02:23:41.320 --> 02:23:43.720]   Oh, very nice

[02:24:13.800 --> 02:24:20.680]   Out didn't he say he was visiting his mom. He's visiting his mom. So i was very well, then I can't complain
[02:24:20.680 --> 02:24:27.720]   I'm glad because i'm glad because this was sounding like an agatha christian novel. That's the point
[02:24:27.720 --> 02:24:31.000]   Okay, we lost two before there were none during the show
[02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:34.920]   So the murderer is either mica leo or me
