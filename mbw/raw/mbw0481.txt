[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:48.880]   once again from his lair somewhere in Silicon Valley, Jim Dow, Rimple of the Loop, Loop
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.080]   Insight.com. Hey, Jim and E.
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.560]   How you doing?
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.440]   I'm great.
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.240]   Welcome back.
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.440]   Also here, Renee Ritchie from iMourds.com.
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.440]   He's from Montreal.
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.600]   We finally got cable television up here.
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.320]   We finally have cable TV.
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.200]   And you can pay for it with your new Apple Watch.
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.840]   But first...
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.040]   Here's Mr. Andy Inacco from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.040]   Hello, Andrew.
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.040]   Hello.
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.040]   Speak sign in right now.
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.240]   I got a channel for fishing and curling.
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.240]   Woo-hoo!
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.240]   Two.
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.240]   Canum, two.
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.240]   TV.
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.960]   We were going through an old popular electronics.
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.040]   This is somebody named Cosmic Race that means it's at this.
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.680]   And it's pay TV's first battle.
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.960]   It's taking place in Etobicoke, a suburb of Toronto, Canada.
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.320]   But they mean Etobicoke and then the world.
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.200]   When they say pay TV, though, it's not cable.
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.720]   If you could see, there's a box on top of that TV set of uppercorns.
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.200]   That's a lot of stress for a writer and an actor.
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.800]   They're holding the quarter in their hand.
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.880]   It's a three hour show.
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.160]   I don't know if it's worth the next half hour at the...
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.080]   Three different programs are simultaneously delivered to the TV receiver by means of a
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.640]   compact attachment mounted on or near the set.
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.200]   The subscriber has the choice of program, if any, he wishes to see.
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.960]   It apparently involves something like that and somebody in a lab coat.
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:22.240]   So this is very scientific.
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.760]   That's the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Council.
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.560]   CRTC still looks like that.
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.280]   The custom built control console for the total TV operation in West Toronto.
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.920]   The operator can monitor all three channels at once.
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.640]   And that's just for Hockey Night in Canada, Leo.
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.640]   This is the car.
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.480]   That hit 'em.
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:44.960]   Oh, okay.
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.840]   Hey, the new iPad is here.
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:54.360]   I trust you have all received your units in the mail.
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.360]   So big.
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.360]   So big.
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.360]   So big.
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.640]   We hold them up and no one can see any of us.
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.080]   And then if you put it in, this is...
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.680]   When I went to the Apple Store, because I ordered it that night and then they said,
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.120]   "Well, just pick it up tomorrow morning in the Apple Store."
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:13.000]   They didn't have the Apple keyboard.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.680]   So I got the creative.
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.960]   Which actually I like better because it's, first of all, $20 cheaper, but it also has
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.880]   special iPad buttons.
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.920]   You know, it's got a home and I love the search button, which is great.
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.760]   But mine is laser-oblated Taffeta, Leo.
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.960]   Oh, yeah, that's pretty sweet.
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.360]   Just like in Project Runway, Taffeta.
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.360]   That's a hard material to keep in control of.
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.360]   It's Tim Gunball.
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.240]   Do you have any prom dresses and bridesmaid dresses that have to give their lives to make
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.240]   this keyboard?
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.680]   Taffeta on yours too, Andy?
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.680]   Yes.
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.880]   Well, I didn't go to prom, so I don't know what Taffeta feels like.
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:48.880]   So that's a fabric.
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.680]   Because it looks like plastic.
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.240]   It's laser-related fabric.
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.600]   So instead of having a scissors or butterflies, it just has the domes and then the structure
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.720]   of the fabric that gives it its...
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.880]   So it's a chocolate keyboard, let's say.
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:00.880]   Let's tell the truth.
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.920]   I guess it feels a lot like...
[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:03.920]   It feels like one.
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:04.920]   Yeah.
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:05.920]   It's a little bit more still.
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.720]   What's interesting about that keyboard though is that it's all molded.
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:09.720]   Right.
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:20.120]   Just to Apple just before this was all released and it was fascinating to see that there's
[00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:25.520]   no actual mechanism in there, which is something we're not used to with the keyboard.
[00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.400]   Obviously, there's a mechanism in there to make the key go up and down.
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:30.400]   Are there switches?
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.400]   What's in there?
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.400]   There's no switches, but there are no...
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.400]   It's molded.
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.400]   It's molded.
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.240]   It's molded plastic or molded fancy stuff.
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.240]   Taffeta something...
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.240]   Taffeta, taffeta, taffeta.
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:47.160]   So you can't put wires because you have to fold it and a wire would get crimped if you
[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.160]   folded it.
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.720]   So they did this thing where they actually, almost like a circuit board, they have power,
[00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.160]   ground, and data all going through the actual fabric itself.
[00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.240]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.240]   Wow.
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.320]   Well, this is a much more conventional keyboard.
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.880]   It just has keys that when you push them, it triggers a switch.
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.600]   It's a lot like the MacBook keyboard.
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:11.800]   It lights up in the back, which is nice powered by the connector so it's not a battery powered
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:12.800]   keyboard.
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:13.800]   And then you get this honkin' big case.
[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:18.600]   And by the way, if you thought the iPad was big, wrap it in the Logitech Create case.
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.520]   And now it's bigger than a MacBook.
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.400]   It's like the size of my MacBook Pro.
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.960]   It's huge and heavy.
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.520]   Yeah, but that's what...
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:30.000]   If you want a really good keyboard, I mean, this is every bit as good as what I've got
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.600]   in my MacBook Pro here.
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.440]   We're at this other keyboard.
[00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:34.440]   It's less so.
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.880]   Yeah, I mean, I could...
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:41.360]   This is so comfortable to use and backlit and scall these function keys too.
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:47.200]   I mean, the first day that I was using it as a full-time device, I was just sort of
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.760]   subconsciously like tickling this part here.
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.760]   Yeah, I expect the trackpad, don't you?
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.360]   And lots of people say that.
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:58.000]   With this, it'll do and it's great because it's so compact.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.920]   It's lighter, yeah.
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:05.080]   It's also great because unlike the Create keyboard, you can easily slap it on and take
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:06.400]   it off again.
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:10.520]   And when it's on, it's practically nothing.
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:14.800]   I have to say, at 170 bucks, it feels a little overpriced.
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.080]   Yeah, I mean, particularly...
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.040]   It's a little bit disappointing.
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.840]   It's great for an Apple product.
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:23.000]   Again, for people who aren't going to be doing hours and hours and hours of typing or are
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.800]   very, very liberal about key touch.
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:31.880]   But given it's a little bit disappointing compared to the Surface 4 Pro keyboard cover, which
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:36.960]   has something that's closer to a MacBook Pro keycaps and field mechanical keys, which
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:41.040]   is that one I certainly could work on all afternoon.
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:45.520]   But I think there's another case of Apple deciding that only we are capable of making
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:49.400]   something like this, we're asked lots of people can make something like the Create keyboard.
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:54.000]   So we'll make the ones that the ones only we can make and let third parties make solutions
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   for other people.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.800]   Despite the feeling that Logitech is barely a third party in this, they worked with Apple
[00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.040]   to make the capture work.
[00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:01.680]   It's sold in the stores.
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:04.880]   In many cases, it's the only keyboard sold in the stores.
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:05.880]   Day one release.
[00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:06.880]   Yeah.
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:09.640]   So I think it almost feels like this is official, semi-official.
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:14.280]   But you pointed out last week you could just as easily, in fact, it might even be happier
[00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:20.240]   with a stand for the iPad Pro that was, maybe you could angle and just a Bluetooth keyboard
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:21.240]   might be...
[00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:23.120]   That's definitely my choice.
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:26.000]   At least, if you're not for portability, obviously.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.280]   But if you're going to use it...
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:31.840]   And by the way, when you use the word portability and the iPad Pro in the same sentence, people
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:32.840]   go, "What?"
[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:33.840]   Because this...
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:35.640]   Do you want this in your man purse?
[00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:36.880]   Where are you going to put this sucker?
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:43.000]   No, I do have to use my laptop case, my skinniest laptop case, but still a 13-inch laptop case
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   to carry this around.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.680]   But there is something to making this as thin as possible.
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:49.840]   I mean, I've been doing a lot of sketching and just noodling around with it.
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:55.840]   And this, the create keyboard, you can fold this around so that you're just looking at
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:57.080]   it from the front there.
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:00.080]   You can also pop it out without too much difficulty.
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.560]   There's a little difficulty.
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:03.560]   It's not easy.
[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:04.560]   Well, there's a trick to it.
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:07.280]   You've got to just basically release one corner and then you can pop it out.
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.880]   The first time you do it, you will be very certain that you're about to break the damn
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:10.880]   thing.
[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:12.600]   But it can be done.
[00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:13.600]   But there's something...
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:19.520]   I think that the ideal thing for this iPad is to just keep it as thin as possible so
[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:21.640]   that when you just want to have it...
[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:26.200]   Even just having it flat on the desktop and interacting with this huge, huge control
[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:29.640]   surface, I had my stand with me.
[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:30.640]   I had all this stuff with me.
[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:35.560]   I was in Starbucks, but I found that I kind of like just having it in 2001, a space odyssey
[00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:42.240]   mode where there's just this rectangle of interactive glass almost level with the tabletop.
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:43.920]   It really is a whole new...
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:47.880]   For something that's so familiar, it really does feel like a whole new way of using an
[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:48.880]   iPad.
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:51.720]   Andy, what do you think of split screen?
[00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:52.720]   Love it.
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:55.760]   This is everything that I've been hoping for.
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:10:01.040]   It's one of the biggest things I loved about Windows 8, one of the few things I really loved
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.840]   about Windows 8, was the ability to...
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:05.720]   I don't necessarily need to have a whole bunch of overlapping windows.
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:10.480]   I really just want to have one main, versus one main pane that has the stuff I'm creating
[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:13.080]   and then something I'm keeping an eye on.
[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:14.080]   You can have that.
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:17.440]   You can have two equal columns like you see Leo doing there.
[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:24.400]   You can have one iPad size screen, one iPhone size screen, and then even the floating video
[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:26.880]   window that you can resize that floats over everything else.
[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:28.560]   That's really all I need.
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:36.240]   So yeah, this is for me, and I think any conversation about using this like a notebook has to underscore
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.840]   your personal quirks.
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:43.760]   For me, this is emphatically as good, if not better, than a MacBook Air.
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:44.760]   Really?
[00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:45.760]   Yeah, I will say that.
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:53.320]   I've come close to buying a MacBook Air or even the 2015 MacBook just because I just feel
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:58.520]   like I need to have something that's lighter than my MacBook Pro.
[00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:02.960]   But it always felt like this isn't an improvement over what I've got now.
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:07.160]   This is for the things that I would be using a MacBook Air for.
[00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:11.440]   Again, I would not be using it as my 24/7 only Macintosh.
[00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:13.280]   The MacBook Air...
[00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:15.080]   The iPad.
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:18.680]   iPad Pro is a better solution for me.
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:19.680]   Yeah.
[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:20.680]   Wow.
[00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:23.680]   That's why I have the iPad Pro and I have the 2015 MacBook.
[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.040]   I use split screen on both.
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:27.200]   They're very similar in many ways.
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:30.800]   But I have workflows that I still prefer the MacBook, like things that I want multiple
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:33.880]   windows and drag and drop and all that kind of stuff because I've been doing it for a
[00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:37.400]   decade and it's hardwired into my system and I'm so fast that way.
[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:41.720]   But when I went to Toronto yesterday for the Apple Pay stuff and I just took the iPad Pro
[00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:44.000]   with me and I forgot it was an iPad Pro.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.440]   I was sitting in a coffee shop writing the story and three hours later I forgot that
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:54.000]   I was using an iPad Pro until I decided to get up and then I unfolded it and I was using
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   the Apple keyboard.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   I was just typing away.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   We're using pages.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.200]   We're using to type into it.
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:00.200]   Notes.
[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:03.000]   I've been trying to start with the baseline.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.720]   I've been sketching in notes too and I wanted to do just the simplest thing I could at first
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:10.600]   and then after this I'm going to use Coda and I'm going to use Procreate.
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:13.360]   But I wanted to give myself a couple of days with the built-in apps and really see what
[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:14.360]   they are.
[00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:17.600]   I feel like the built-in apps are always the baseline and they give you the idea of the
[00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:19.520]   minimum you can do with the system.
[00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:23.880]   I was really pleasantly surprised and I also know it syncs with everything.
[00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:26.200]   It doesn't just sync with other iOS devices.
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.720]   I changed something in notes here.
[00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:30.400]   When I do go home to my Mac all that stuff is just there.
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:34.000]   I have five or six articles that I just wrote in there that are just as valid right now
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   in a Notes app on this iMac.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.520]   I really, really like that sort of, the whole package with this was just so great.
[00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:43.560]   Then I folded it up, pulled out the pencil and started sketching while I waited for my
[00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:44.560]   plan.
[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:46.120]   No, wait a minute on the pencil thing.
[00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:47.120]   Yes.
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:49.800]   How did you get a pencil?
[00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:52.160]   Apple provided pencils to people who are getting them.
[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.480]   I'm not the only person.
[00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:57.360]   The pencil, I got online pretty quick.
[00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:00.960]   It was like four in the morning our time and there were no pencils to be had.
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:01.960]   It said December.
[00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:03.920]   You'll get yours December 7th.
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:06.120]   People are saying on Twitter that they're getting them in stores today.
[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:07.120]   They're finding a bunch of the stores today.
[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:08.120]   So like you could go in the store.
[00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:10.440]   Well, they've always been available.
[00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:16.280]   I've been hearing that stores are getting literally one or two and not necessarily overnight
[00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:17.280]   to stock.
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:20.640]   Meaning that there's a shipment at one in the afternoon that they don't know about and
[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:22.440]   they got two pencils in.
[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:28.480]   So if you are really, really hot to get a pencil before whatever is promised to be delivered,
[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:33.040]   it is worth calling around or just if there's an Apple store on your way home, just stop
[00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:34.200]   by that Apple store.
[00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:37.920]   Just like you're looking for a limited edition short-pack Star Wars figures.
[00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:40.720]   You got to just keep dropping in and hope that you get lucky.
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:43.160]   Yes, Trinity got hers at her local Apple store today.
[00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:44.160]   All right.
[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:46.760]   So I'm going to get mine next week because I've already ordered it.
[00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:47.760]   I don't want to.
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:48.760]   But why?
[00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:49.760]   Why Apple?
[00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:54.520]   Because really truthfully, do you think this thing without the pencil is as in?
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:59.280]   I mean, the pencil seems like a very big part of this.
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:00.440]   We are not happy.
[00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:04.040]   There are no pencils and you have to believe that no one at Apple is happy that there aren't
[00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:05.560]   sufficient quantity of pencils.
[00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:09.280]   It's part of Apple's sprints for their deadline all the time and occasionally they don't make
[00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:10.280]   it.
[00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:13.280]   There are so many things that have to come together for this kind of aggressive product
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:14.280]   development.
[00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:18.160]   It's like a miracle that Windows boots up on the wide variety of hardware that it does
[00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:19.160]   every day.
[00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:22.480]   It's a miracle the iPhone comes in the way it does every year after year.
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:27.520]   We've seen sometimes like the Apple TV came in hot, the iPad Mini 3 came in hot last year.
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:31.560]   Now they just could not coordinate everything to get pencils in store on time.
[00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:37.000]   The alternative is to hold the iPad, but you can't really sell an iPad after Black Friday.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.160]   It's just not how people buy things.
[00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:42.360]   They could have held the pencils and released all the pencils at once in December.
[00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:45.360]   But it's sort of like, well, we want to get them to as many people as we can.
[00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:48.560]   So it's sort of making the best of a bad situation for them.
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:49.560]   Why though?
[00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:50.560]   I'm sure they wanted...
[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:55.520]   It's trying to be there must have something went wrong in manufacture.
[00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:58.840]   So for the watches, like we had to wait for watches, but rumor has it now that the Taptic
[00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:01.800]   engines were really hard to combine and they had really low yields on them.
[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:03.800]   So they had something went wrong with the pencils.
[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:05.600]   Yeah, it's got to be what it feels like.
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:09.440]   You don't plan to launch the iPad without the pencil.
[00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:10.440]   Right?
[00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:15.160]   Yeah, they're getting some, but they are getting some out there.
[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:19.160]   It's not only us reviewers got allocated some devices.
[00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:24.320]   It is getting out there, but it's just like you said, I ordered my iPad Pro 20.
[00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:30.520]   I think that around here finally went live like 3 10 in the morning and at 3 15.
[00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:34.760]   Whenever it was that I tried to add pencils to my order, they were just not available,
[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:38.880]   not just not available for in-store pickup at the two stores I normally shop at.
[00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:40.640]   I checked all of New England.
[00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:42.440]   I checked New York.
[00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:44.400]   Nowhere can you get a pencil?
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:45.400]   Yeah.
[00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:49.800]   But there's some people who are getting them just by again hanging out and just getting
[00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:55.760]   out wearing astronaut diapers and just staying at that store until there's a raise of excitement
[00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:56.760]   in the back.
[00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:58.480]   So they get a few in at a time.
[00:15:58.480 --> 00:15:59.480]   Yeah.
[00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:00.480]   And they should definitely work today.
[00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:05.440]   I think that once you like all really great things, once you get it, you will forget about
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:06.440]   how long you had to wait.
[00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:07.440]   You had to wait for it.
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:08.440]   It's amazing.
[00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:09.440]   It's fun.
[00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:10.440]   I was using the notes app to sketch with.
[00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:13.880]   I don't know if this can be seen or not, but here go full screen on.
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:14.880]   Oh, look at that.
[00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:15.880]   Oh, I saw that.
[00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:16.880]   You posted that.
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:18.680]   That's Tim Cook announcing the iPad Pro.
[00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:21.360]   I just started trying because you're an artist.
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:23.120]   See, for me, it's not going to help.
[00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:24.120]   I'm an idiot.
[00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:25.120]   I've got.
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:26.120]   I started.
[00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:27.760]   Like this is a friend of mine.
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:28.760]   That's a great picture.
[00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:29.920]   Color stuff.
[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:33.080]   So as an artist, this is a great platform, right?
[00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:35.160]   Leo, there's two things about it that make it terrific.
[00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:37.880]   And just for some background, I went to school for art.
[00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:42.200]   I drew every day after school for hours, went to college in a fine arts program.
[00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:46.000]   And then I worked in design where I used Wacom tablets for over 10 years.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.160]   And this is the closest thing I've ever felt to when I used to just draw with a pencil
[00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:50.160]   on paper.
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:53.320]   And it's not exactly the same way, but it's super close.
[00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:57.240]   And the nice thing is with a program like Procreate, I used to do all the kind of art.
[00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:58.360]   Like you did oils and passed out.
[00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:02.600]   And they just going to the store, buying the stuff, coming, setting up, cleaning up.
[00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:05.840]   It became as time got more and more constrained.
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:07.640]   You just I just didn't take the stuff out anymore.
[00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:09.160]   It's sitting in a closet now.
[00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:11.000]   And with this, I just pick a brush, start there.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.240]   And now I'm doing a lot of color.
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:13.240]   Yeah.
[00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:14.240]   It's like paperless.
[00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:20.720]   See, if they made a pencil version for an iPad Air or a mini, would it be as good?
[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:21.880]   So the technology you need.
[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:25.600]   So I understand, but I'm saying next generation, let's say they make.
[00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:28.280]   Do you need all that real estate is the question for an?
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:32.920]   I would love I would love an iPad Air three with the same type of 203 Hertz refresh rate
[00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:34.360]   and the electromagnetic stuff in it.
[00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:38.080]   I to be honest, I would love this in an in an iPhone six plus.
[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:41.880]   I know some people are complaining about the lack of touch ID, but these are all different
[00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:45.000]   technologies like the force press in the watch is different than the force press in the
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.280]   Mac is different than 3D touch is different than the pressure sensitive pan.
[00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:51.720]   And you start putting all those things together and you got really thick, really heavy screens.
[00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:55.120]   So they have to sort of pick and choose for now, but in a perfect world, I would have
[00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:59.960]   a little like field notes version on my phone six plus where I could sit there and doodle
[00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:01.120]   out in the park or something.
[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:03.040]   I'm a huge fan of this technology.
[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:04.040]   Yeah.
[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:05.040]   It's just amazing.
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:06.040]   Renee is absolutely right.
[00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:09.860]   I mean, I'm not really I'm not really an artist, but it just allows you to play and make
[00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:12.780]   mistakes and I've never like drawn with color.
[00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:16.880]   But I mean, if you as I just don't understand how like mixing colors works and how the tools
[00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:23.300]   work, the fact that you can just screw around work based on a photo and just make mistakes
[00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:24.820]   and make them very easily.
[00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:29.320]   This is it's it's like procreate has become like my favorite game, my favorite iPad game
[00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:33.160]   ever, because you're just got some time to kill and you just want to fool around.
[00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:37.200]   And every time I've every time I've sat down thinking I was just going to fool around for
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:41.220]   a second because oh, I want to test this out or I just want to see if this works.
[00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:42.900]   It's like three hours later.
[00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:47.240]   And now I've created something that maybe isn't great, but I'm sort of like now invested
[00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:49.220]   in it's just amazing.
[00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:57.060]   I think the thing that you have to remember with with the pencil what what Apple was able
[00:18:57.060 --> 00:18:59.700]   to do was was reduce any latency.
[00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:03.140]   And that's the big part about the pencil.
[00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:11.240]   Now, when I when I spoke with Apple about how the pencil works between the pencil and
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:19.080]   the screen and the technology that's built into both of those, the screen actually tries
[00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:22.440]   to predict where you're going to go.
[00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:26.800]   So if you're drawing a circle, it'll predict that you're drawing a circle and the pressure
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:35.760]   that you have on on that line and it will intelligently go back and backfill the line
[00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:41.140]   and the prediction so that it's it's exact to what you actually did.
[00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:46.880]   So if at the end you put a little bit more pressure on the pencil, it will backfill that.
[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:52.360]   Now that's not something you can actually see because it's happening so quickly that
[00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:55.360]   you don't see it happening.
[00:19:55.360 --> 00:20:00.360]   And that's incredible to think about that that it's predicting where you're going to
[00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:05.240]   go then goes back and backfills where you actually went but does it in an amount of
[00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:10.200]   time that's not visible to you as a user.
[00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:11.200]   That's crazy.
[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:17.840]   Here's one of the Andy's works of art.
[00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:21.080]   The two problems with the Wacom tablet I always had is first there was a separate layer so
[00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:24.320]   there was an air gap and there was parallax and once you saw it you could never unsee
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:25.320]   it.
[00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:27.760]   But also it didn't have the predictive stuff at least not when I was using it which was
[00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:32.720]   about five years ago that Jim is talking about and it's almost like once you have direct
[00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:36.320]   one-to-one manipulation with iOS like you touch something and you move it and you have
[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:38.960]   that connection anything that breaks it seems wrong.
[00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:43.080]   So they really want it to be close to instant and to do that you need the prediction.
[00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:46.400]   It's like in the old days of iPhone when you scroll safari so fast they wouldn't try
[00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:48.600]   to render the interface because that would slow you down.
[00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:51.760]   So what they did is just sort of fudge it a little bit and then render it to catch up
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:52.760]   with you.
[00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:56.400]   The thing with this is some people have complained that some apps aren't as good as others and
[00:20:56.400 --> 00:21:00.280]   Apple actually made frameworks for it so there's a coalesce touch and a predictive
[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:04.900]   touch API and developers can call those because every app is a little bit different and Pro
[00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:08.920]   Create actually lets you customize it because artists are really particular about the kinds
[00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:13.160]   of pencils and the kinds of settings that we like like we get an H pencil or B pencil
[00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:16.440]   is all sorts of different varieties and you can go in and individually adjust all those
[00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:21.400]   things to make it not just a great pencil but the great pencil that you prefer using.
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:22.400]   It's really powerful.
[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:28.120]   Here's the original that Andy, this is the original photograph that Andy used as his
[00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:31.400]   model for his pencil drawing.
[00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:33.920]   Actually, are you an artist Andy?
[00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:35.080]   Because you know what?
[00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:36.080]   Really good.
[00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:41.360]   If you're not, this is a strong case for the iPad Pro and pencil.
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:42.880]   I've never worked as an artist.
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:47.960]   I've been a doodler and it's really, it's not that, see an artist could have knocked
[00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:53.080]   that out in about 20 minutes, that took me a couple of hours but you can, it's Pro Create
[00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:57.960]   and the pencil and the iPad Pro lets you do art via the Braille method.
[00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:02.160]   You feel your way around and you, until you get the results that you want.
[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:05.840]   That is a strong case for this because it means that people who are not artists but
[00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:09.280]   have wanted to be might find this tool that helps them get into that.
[00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:10.280]   Go ahead Jim, I'm sorry.
[00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:12.120]   I also did a picture.
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:13.120]   Did you?
[00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:15.240]   How do I send it to you?
[00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:19.560]   You could put a link in the, Andy just put, first of all you got to get it online and
[00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:25.160]   then you could put a link to wherever you've stored it in our rundown on Google Drive if
[00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:29.720]   you want or just you can put it in the chat room if you want.
[00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:35.760]   I feel like in some ways, okay my reaction to this is it's a very, very niche product
[00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:39.600]   that it's going to appeal to artists.
[00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:43.320]   If there's an app that takes advantage of the real estate and makes sense for you, it's
[00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:44.640]   going to appeal to you.
[00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:50.720]   It doesn't, I mean I still prefer my mini iPad mini because it's light, it's easy to carry
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:52.120]   around.
[00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:54.880]   This is more of a production is involved with this.
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:58.320]   It's not something I feel like you're just going to carry to the couch while you're watching
[00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:00.640]   TV or maybe it is, I don't know.
[00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:05.120]   It seems like a niche product and my counsel to people has been, go try it and look for
[00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:06.480]   the apps that you want to use.
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:08.240]   Think about how you want to use this.
[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:12.240]   Does it make sense for you then that would be an appropriate product?
[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:13.720]   I absolutely agree.
[00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:16.840]   I hope that because it's expensive.
[00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:18.200]   It's expensive.
[00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:21.280]   It's especially compared to Windows tablets.
[00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:25.920]   If I, it would have been a lot more tempting to get a Surface Pro if I were a Windows user
[00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:28.720]   instead of a Mac user.
[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:32.440]   I keep, I'm just kind of struggling with that kind of recommendation for the same amount
[00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:37.360]   of money you can get a device that for a lot more people is going to be a much more, a
[00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:42.320]   much better value because it will be a full on Windows machine with USB and none of the
[00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:45.960]   inconveniences of using an iOS based device.
[00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:49.240]   For me, it's such a great thing because I always envisioned that it wouldn't be a replacement
[00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:53.640]   for anything but it would be like the difference between a horse and a bicycle where it doesn't
[00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:58.080]   do everything a horse does but it does things that this, that only this can do and that has
[00:23:58.080 --> 00:23:59.680]   been approving correct.
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:04.160]   Even now I've got the, I've got my, this is, this is Apple's loaner over here.
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:10.480]   I've got my own personal iPad Pro to the left of my, to the left of my Macbook here being
[00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:12.240]   used as a second display.
[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:15.560]   It's just a whole bunch of different nooks and crannies of my day in which this is just
[00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:20.880]   a valuable tool and people need to understand that you can't just buy it and it'll be great,
[00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:22.960]   just as great as they're using an iPad Air or something.
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:26.040]   I think it's also possible for the photographer that this might be.
[00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:27.480]   I've been playing with Lightroom.
[00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:32.520]   I liked Lightroom on the iPad on the Air and on the Mini but it was a little too small.
[00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:37.560]   This is big enough and the screen is good enough that I can really use this, you know,
[00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:42.360]   in Lightroom to reject to actually even do some retouching and so forth.
[00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:43.800]   And the Adobe apps are fantastic.
[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:45.600]   Adobe's really focused on this.
[00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:48.600]   Oh, they did such a great job.
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:55.960]   And you can tell that Apple knew that part of the success of the iPad Pro was how third
[00:24:55.960 --> 00:25:02.720]   parties were going to adopt it and support it because they worked very hard with Adobe
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:08.960]   and Procreate and other companies, software and hardware to make sure that everybody
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:12.240]   knew that these apps were coming out for the Pro.
[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:14.680]   And that's important.
[00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:20.360]   It's important for people to know not only that it's a different platform but that there's
[00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:22.800]   third party support for that platform.
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:25.720]   Leo, I uploaded the picture, my drawing.
[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:27.120]   Where can we find it?
[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:28.120]   Have you pasted it?
[00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:29.120]   It's in the chatroom.
[00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:30.440]   In the chatroom you pasted the link.
[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:31.440]   All right.
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:32.440]   There we go.
[00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:33.440]   Wrong.
[00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:35.240]   Wrong screen there, Jason.
[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:36.920]   Jason's trying to find it.
[00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:37.920]   I'm going to try this one.
[00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:39.920]   He's got it on the Skype chat.
[00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:41.520]   Ah, that's the problem.
[00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:43.760]   No, it's on the Skype chat because that let me see.
[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:44.760]   I'm trying to.
[00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:45.760]   There you go.
[00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:47.680]   Very nice, Jim.
[00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:49.520]   Jim, you're going places.
[00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:51.880]   Is that a high neck in your hand?
[00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:53.600]   That's like a mirror.
[00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:57.520]   Yeah, that's self-portrait.
[00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:59.520]   Artist with beer.
[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:01.520]   That's a beer in no ears.
[00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:04.120]   That's 10 hours of work.
[00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:07.760]   So Jim, you're more like me in this realm.
[00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:11.320]   What about the iPad Pro appeals to you?
[00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:12.760]   What would you use this for?
[00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:13.760]   Music?
[00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:17.400]   You know, I'm really looking forward to using it for music.
[00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:21.720]   But for me, it's been more of a work tool.
[00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:26.240]   That's why I asked Andy what he thought of the split screen because that has been huge
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:27.240]   for me.
[00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:28.400]   Are you going to start writing on it?
[00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:29.400]   Yeah.
[00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:31.040]   Well, I've always written on my iPad.
[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:33.640]   I've never done more research on my iPad.
[00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:43.120]   So using an iPad Pro in split screen, you have two full-size iPad side-by-side.
[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:45.240]   That's what it turns out to be.
[00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:46.440]   So that's huge.
[00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:56.760]   It's huge as a writer to be able to, you know, have two iPads side-by-side, have one open
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:27:01.880]   page for a webpage when I'm looking for information and links and things like that and have the
[00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:08.360]   other open in notes so that I can copy and paste all of that stuff in there.
[00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:15.800]   So it's a lot easier than going, you know, with the multitasking to switch apps and then
[00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:18.520]   go back again and then, you know, back and forth.
[00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:22.320]   Now you're just tapping from one side of the screen to the other and it's a lot more
[00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:23.320]   efficient.
[00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:24.320]   Yeah.
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:30.360]   And part of it also, I'm sure that you've seen this too, is that now that iOS 9 has better
[00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:36.320]   keyboard shortcuts, you switch between apps just by the same way you do in Mac OS, by hitting
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:37.720]   Command Tab.
[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:42.840]   Whenever I need to search for something, I hit Command Space to enable Spotlight.
[00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:46.600]   A lot of apps that are getting serious about this have, you've hold down the Command key
[00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:50.560]   and it will show you a pop-up of here's all the keyboard shortcuts this thing supports.
[00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:55.080]   So it's still going to be a drag for a lot of people to not have a mouse or a trackpad
[00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:57.240]   and have to reach up and tap the screen for something.
[00:27:57.240 --> 00:28:01.760]   But that's really the only limitation that is hardwired into iOS at this point.
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:04.640]   So it's a very practical thing.
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:08.580]   Even if you don't necessarily have an iPad Pro, I think it's great because of the larger
[00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:10.200]   screen and all the other things it can do.
[00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:17.240]   But even if you all you have is an iPad Air 2, to be able to run split screen apps is just
[00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:18.800]   such a leap forward for the whole platform.
[00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:23.680]   I have to be careful because I mocked Chrome OS when it came out.
[00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:26.200]   I said, "Well, you just buy a computer and use the browser.
[00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:27.880]   You've got Chrome OS."
[00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:32.480]   And so it's very tempting to say, "Well, you just buy a, you know, I don't know.
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:34.240]   There is no touch solution for Apple.
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:37.320]   So I guess this is the only way to do that."
[00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:42.960]   But actually when you, and I love my Surface Book, and in many respects you could make
[00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:44.560]   the same comments about the Surface Book.
[00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:48.880]   But the pen is not as good as Apple's pencil.
[00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:53.440]   And it's Windows, which is really as, touches an afterthought.
[00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:57.880]   At the same time as I use this, I feel like, gosh, I'd really rather use my MacBook.
[00:28:57.880 --> 00:28:59.360]   It's thinner, lighter.
[00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:02.760]   And I have, you know, I have one side by side Windows.
[00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:04.760]   I could have, you know, lots of Windows.
[00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:06.000]   It's not.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:11.200]   So I feel like I'm not sure, I feel like you, in order to make this work for you, you have
[00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:13.560]   to accept certain limitations.
[00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:15.640]   Or it could just be a difference in background.
[00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:17.320]   Like, I'm really similar to Yulia.
[00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:21.040]   And sometimes, like, I just grew up using Unix and Windows, and I used some multi-Windows.
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:22.800]   But, and I keep using this story.
[00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:25.280]   My mom's primary computer is an iPad.
[00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:29.240]   And even though it's not as powerful as her iMac, she is more empowered by it.
[00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:30.240]   It's more approachable.
[00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:31.240]   Yeah, my mom.
[00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:32.800]   I've got to get this one from my mom.
[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:37.080]   She, because she, I bought her a Note 4, because she like to use the stylist and draw
[00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:38.080]   on it.
[00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:41.520]   And she's going to flip her lid on this with Procreate.
[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:42.520]   But it's a thousand.
[00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:46.960]   But so the thing is, like, to go back to your earlier point, I love the iPad mini 4, especially
[00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:48.640]   with us, with a split screen too.
[00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:52.200]   But if you just want to read, if you want to watch Netflix, hold it, walk around with
[00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:56.120]   it, it's a much better iPad than this, because you can't hold this up for long periods of
[00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:57.120]   time.
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:00.680]   But if you want to be able to do all the things that Andy and Jim are talking about, you want
[00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:01.680]   the big screen.
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:03.960]   So for me, it's sort of, do you pride the lightness?
[00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:06.840]   Like, do you, is that the most important thing to you as a portability?
[00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:07.840]   Or is it the screen?
[00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:09.600]   And then it makes it a much easier choice.
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:10.600]   Yeah.
[00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:11.600]   Yeah.
[00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:16.200]   I'm kind of thinking, though, about how most of the people who are writing these reviews
[00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:19.800]   are people who are really hardwired to like something like this.
[00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:24.320]   We're people who, if we're, if we are full-time writers, that's what we do.
[00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:25.320]   We write.
[00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:28.800]   And writing on this device is really, really, really good.
[00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:31.840]   That might not be the same experience that other people have, where writing is maybe
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:36.160]   just a little part of what they do, and they chiefly are doing it inside messages or email.
[00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:41.280]   So that's why I really do think you should, a lot of us are pretty excited about it because
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:43.400]   it's kind of like the original iPad.
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:48.720]   If there was an iPad Pro-shaped hole in your life, this will spackle it very, very nicely.
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:53.640]   But if you try to make it fit into a MacBook Air hole, it will fit, but it will be some
[00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:54.640]   gaps.
[00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:55.640]   It was funny yesterday.
[00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:59.840]   I was on the plane and they made everyone put away their computers for takeoff and landing.
[00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:04.280]   But there was, I think, two or three iPad Pros, an iPad Air with a large set keyboard
[00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:06.080]   case and a surface with a keyboard.
[00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:07.720]   And we just could keep them out and keep working.
[00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:10.560]   Couldn't keep the tray table down, but they were just on our laps and we were still typing
[00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:11.560]   away.
[00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:13.840]   And the laptop users are fuming.
[00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:19.640]   I have to say, one thing that really is great on this, the audio quality is really remarkable
[00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:20.920]   for a device of size.
[00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:25.000]   And the crossfade when you rotate it and it goes back in reposition the highs and lows
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.960]   as fast as the animation changes.
[00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:28.880]   Yeah, it's really kind of beautiful.
[00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:30.440]   The speakers as well as the speakers.
[00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:36.160]   As a full-time gamer, I find this a lot of fun.
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:41.280]   Now, this is supposedly, this is Monument Valley, supposedly updated for the iPad.
[00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:43.280]   I'm not sure what that means.
[00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:45.000]   Monument Valley experience is extraordinarily old.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.760]   Yeah, for the iPad Pro somehow this is, it looks the same, but maybe there's some magic
[00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:49.760]   that they've done.
[00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:51.960]   By higher density, it's easy to see though.
[00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:58.640]   But even a game that's not originally designed, I'll take goat simulator for instance.
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:00.880]   It's really fun to play on a screen of this size.
[00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:03.680]   I mean, it's just a different, it's kind of a different experience.
[00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:06.240]   And that chip is so powerful.
[00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:08.240]   Yeah, it doesn't have any trouble, does it?
[00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:10.480]   It was the pop-up.
[00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:15.000]   Yes, Jim said something that was really important too.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:19.400]   I talked about how I was tempted by the Surface Pro and if I were a Windows user, it'd be
[00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:22.680]   hard not to get the Surface Pro instead.
[00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:28.800]   But the thing is that there's a ton of really great Windows desktop apps for multi-touch
[00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:29.800]   devices.
[00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:32.560]   There aren't a whole lot of apps like the kinds you can get for the iPad.
[00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:36.200]   There aren't a whole bunch that are designed specifically for multi-touch.
[00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:39.920]   Windows 10 works great as a Touch OS, but if you really want the sort of apps that take
[00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:46.640]   full advantage of having a 12.9 inch diagonal screen of multi-touch, they're just so thin
[00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:48.640]   on the ground on the Windows side.
[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:51.360]   Rest, they are everywhere in the iPad.
[00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:52.360]   Yeah.
[00:32:52.360 --> 00:33:01.640]   Well, and if you look at what Adobe did with Photoshop and Comp and all of those iPad Pro
[00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:11.880]   apps, they made it very easy using the pencil and using touch and gestures to edit and
[00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:16.280]   manipulate the content that's on your screen.
[00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:19.760]   It's easy to do, but there's not a lot of depth to it.
[00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:22.600]   That's great because I don't really think that you want to want to depth on the iPad
[00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:23.600]   Pro.
[00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:30.160]   However, when you export those images and the work, it comes up in Photoshop on your desktop
[00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:34.280]   with all of the layers in text.
[00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:35.760]   That's huge.
[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:37.160]   It's huge.
[00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:44.360]   So that's one way I think where Adobe worked with Apple as a third party to say, "We can
[00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:46.920]   do some really great things on this."
[00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:49.880]   It's amazing to me because I spent years and years using Adobe Creative Suite and using
[00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:52.280]   Photoshop and Illustrator and InDesign.
[00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:55.680]   It used to take me hours to set up, never mind putting the stuff in design, but just
[00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:56.680]   setting it up.
[00:33:56.680 --> 00:34:00.760]   The minute you see that demo and all the tools, it's finger painting, you don't have to get
[00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:04.680]   it perfect immediately, but it's so fast to get your columns, your pictures, everything
[00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:06.080]   where you want them.
[00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:09.360]   Then just like Jim said, you can go back to the desktop version to do a lot of the heavy
[00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:14.120]   lifting for now, but boy, can you get it really, really close, really, really fast.
[00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:19.680]   The time saving alone, just for everything from Adobe Fix to Adobe Comp, is remarkable
[00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:20.680]   to me.
[00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:21.680]   Which tools?
[00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:29.040]   I think I downloaded everything, Draw, Fix, Clip, Comp, Sketch, Voice, Mix, and Lightroom.
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:31.880]   I think they've all been adapted for the pro, right?
[00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:37.560]   Some are more like Comp, as you say, is really, this is about the pro, right?
[00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:41.480]   It makes me want years of my life back later.
[00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:43.400]   What do you do with Comp?
[00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:44.400]   You do page layouts.
[00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:47.200]   So basically, you can start your InDesign document right in Comp.
[00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:48.200]   Got it.
[00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:49.200]   So this is kind of a...
[00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:51.400]   Boy, you know, and there are certain things.
[00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:56.560]   This is, I think, important for the designers to really think about, as you said, Jim, what's
[00:34:56.560 --> 00:35:01.120]   appropriate for the iPad Pro and what's appropriate for the desktop and to understand that people
[00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:08.360]   are going to mix environments and use the touch in a way that really is native to the
[00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:11.200]   iPad Pro, not try to be a desktop app.
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:12.200]   Is that right?
[00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:14.320]   Well, I think so.
[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:20.240]   I mean, I think it's important that people can use the iPad and use apps that are optimized
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:21.880]   for the iPad.
[00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:29.540]   It's so much of a bonus when you can take those that work, images or whatever it is,
[00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:31.520]   and export it to your desktop app.
[00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:36.920]   So in Comp, you can sit in a meeting with people and say, you know, instead of doing it on
[00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:42.160]   a piece of paper or trying to manipulate a laptop, you can do it on the iPad Pro and
[00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:43.160]   say, "Okay.
[00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:49.680]   This is what you're suggesting," and mock up a page, export that to InDesign or Illustrator
[00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:53.400]   on your desktop and continue working on it later.
[00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:59.120]   That is where the power, I think, of third parties and Apple working together consume
[00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:02.160]   because people are going to get a lot of use out of that, I think.
[00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:04.240]   It seems very natural, you know, to...
[00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:05.720]   At least for...
[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:07.920]   It's sketching, right?
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:13.720]   But it's sketching for in the case of Comp for page layout and in the case, you know, it's
[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:15.360]   sketching for a particular medium.
[00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:17.160]   It's what we used to do on boards in the old days.
[00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:20.000]   You made a comp by putting a board up and sticking stuff on top of it.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.320]   That's why you want to get your life back.
[00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:23.400]   This is all the stuff that you don't have to do anymore.
[00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:24.400]   Yeah.
[00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:27.520]   And if people just listening who weren't watching the feed, they just showed you, you make an
[00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:31.400]   X and it put a text box there, you drew out two columns and it filled it with Laura Mipseam.
[00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:34.720]   I mean, that would have taken me at least five minutes on it.
[00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:35.720]   I know.
[00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:39.960]   So I think part of this is going to require a new way of thinking not only the part of
[00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:46.520]   users but part of developers and then they'll be a virtuous circle here because as users
[00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:48.520]   kind of find new ways to use this.
[00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:53.720]   I mean, there are things like paper from '53 that's kind of ready to go.
[00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:54.720]   There are lots of...
[00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:55.720]   All the omni stuff, Leo?
[00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:56.720]   All the omni group has always been...
[00:36:56.720 --> 00:37:03.000]   Now, that's an interesting question because I think omni-graffal and project and things
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   that are graphical.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.240]   Would you use this for focus?
[00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:07.240]   You put it in the slide.
[00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:12.040]   You put it in the split view on the right hand side that you're talking about as you're...
[00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:13.040]   Yeah.
[00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:14.040]   Yeah.
[00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:15.040]   That's an interesting point.
[00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:17.160]   Then let's not leave out Microsoft too.
[00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:20.040]   Microsoft Office, their mobile apps work exceptionally well.
[00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:21.320]   It supports split view.
[00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:23.920]   It has some keyboard shortcuts.
[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:28.240]   I've been doing most of my work in Word while I'm waiting for other apps to get updated
[00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:29.760]   or even just for iOS 9.
[00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:30.760]   Yeah.
[00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:35.200]   I would, for instance, use one of the Adobe apps, design a lovely illustration and then
[00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:36.200]   somehow...
[00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:38.200]   How would you get that into?
[00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:40.680]   Sometimes you can copy and paste and you can drag that in.
[00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:43.800]   See, this is a few things they need to work on a little bit, right?
[00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:44.800]   The idea...
[00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:48.520]   I mean, the iPad doesn't really facilitate inter-app communication.
[00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:49.520]   It's very primitive.
[00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:53.680]   Well, it's also like you have to think how would they do something like there's no keyboard
[00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:57.460]   navigation really, but could they bring the focus UI from Apple TV and let you use arrow
[00:37:57.460 --> 00:38:00.620]   keys to select different focus elements maybe?
[00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:05.900]   Could they put two fingers down on a keyboard and simulate the trackpad mode on the iPad?
[00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:09.100]   Could they do something where there's a gesture that floats something up out of the operating
[00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:13.740]   system, puts it in an extension and then paste that extension into another app so it's secure?
[00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:14.740]   But it's fun.
[00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:20.260]   I mean, all these iOS 10s next year, all these great things could be coming our way.
[00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:21.260]   Yeah.
[00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:26.420]   Sometimes you wish they would let sort of a three-quarters solution out a barn first,
[00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:30.620]   though, because the first time that even in the beta's where I was using Split View,
[00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:34.700]   you just feel as though if I can just take my fingertip and drag something from one pane
[00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:37.060]   into the other and that doesn't work.
[00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:38.060]   Yeah.
[00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:39.060]   Well, it's the two things.
[00:38:39.060 --> 00:38:40.060]   It should be able to do that, right?
[00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:43.580]   The two funnest things I had and these are not man is contradicted, but people were saying,
[00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:45.420]   "I wish I could touch the screen of my Mac."
[00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:48.260]   And then people were saying, "I don't want to have to touch the screen of my iPad.
[00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:49.740]   The keyboard should be better."
[00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:53.260]   And then they were saying, "Well, Apple should have done more to enable the iPad Pro interface,
[00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:56.820]   but Apple should have slowed down and stabilized everything before they add new features."
[00:38:56.820 --> 00:39:01.420]   So that's the thing about humans is that this stuff excites us, so we want it all at once.
[00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:03.020]   Well, and we can think of ways to improve it.
[00:39:03.020 --> 00:39:05.060]   It's more like there are just a lot of humans out there.
[00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:06.060]   Yeah.
[00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:07.060]   It's not a different way to use.
[00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:08.460]   It's not there's one way to do it.
[00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:09.460]   Right.
[00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:13.580]   It's just that there, and in the meantime, instead of having a solution that kind of works,
[00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:15.380]   you have no solution whatsoever.
[00:39:15.380 --> 00:39:16.380]   Right.
[00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:21.540]   And if in those occasions where what you want is something that's not a high priority for
[00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:25.220]   Apple because they are trying to figure out a way to make an even more expensive watch
[00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:29.900]   band before they've solved cut and paste problems, it can be a little bit frustrating.
[00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:33.180]   Well, if you follow Steve's, we talked about before, if you follow him on Twitter, Steve
[00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:36.500]   Totten Smith, he found some of the code for that kind of stuff already.
[00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:38.460]   So he just looks like it's not finished.
[00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:39.460]   Interesting.
[00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:42.940]   What apps show up in this scroll list in the sidebar?
[00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:45.780]   They have to specifically hook into this, right?
[00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:49.740]   They have to set a flag that says that they support the size class as necessary to do
[00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:50.740]   this.
[00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:56.060]   So, presumably, by the way, that's going to be an interface issue because already this
[00:39:56.060 --> 00:39:59.460]   is unmanageable and there's no way to search.
[00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:01.820]   You just have to scroll through a bunch of icon.
[00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:06.180]   That's okay because you're not it's not as though that again, this is not even alphabetical
[00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:07.180]   though.
[00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:08.380]   It's just it's it's it's okay.
[00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:10.860]   It's not a multi-windowed environment.
[00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:15.580]   This really is what two apps do you want to run and under that context, this is I think
[00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:21.300]   that's it's better to have a simpler idea than a way to create a second dock just for sidebar
[00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:22.860]   scrolling apps.
[00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:23.860]   It's recency sourced.
[00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:24.860]   I sort of.
[00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:26.300]   Yeah, it's recency, right?
[00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:28.460]   So but the recency is at the bottom.
[00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:29.460]   Yes.
[00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:30.940]   It's what comes up first.
[00:40:30.940 --> 00:40:32.140]   Oh, it is.
[00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:33.140]   It's what it first shows up.
[00:40:33.140 --> 00:40:34.140]   Okay.
[00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:35.540]   Oh, that's right because you're pulling it down, aren't you?
[00:40:35.540 --> 00:40:36.540]   Yeah.
[00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:38.020]   Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:43.220]   Yeah, I mean, I just I would caution people to really kind of think about it and play
[00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:45.620]   with it to make sure it's going to fit their use case.
[00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:49.700]   I think I think Tim Cook did a little bit of a disservice by saying, Oh, who needs a
[00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:50.700]   PC anymore?
[00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:51.700]   You got an iPad pro.
[00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:53.420]   I don't think that's the case.
[00:40:53.420 --> 00:40:58.020]   Yeah, that absolutely I cringed a little when I saw that interview.
[00:40:58.020 --> 00:41:01.860]   It's it's fun when the CEO throws a little fire for the release week of a device, particularly
[00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:04.980]   when there's clearly a Popeye and Bluto.
[00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:09.220]   I mean, there's there's there's surface pro four out there and it's not a bad tablet at
[00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:10.220]   all.
[00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:11.220]   It's really, really nice.
[00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:12.220]   Great.
[00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:16.420]   It's people are going to be really happy with this if they expect it to be a brand new thing
[00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:21.380]   as opposed to it's even better when you think of it as a compliment to something you already
[00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:25.940]   have rather than instead of buying instead of buying one of these, I'm going to buy one
[00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:26.940]   of these instead.
[00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:30.420]   I was tempted last week that it, you know, like we talked about last week, I had to replace
[00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:32.780]   my Macbook Pro unexpectedly.
[00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:35.060]   And I thought, gee, wouldn't it be nice to wait until now?
[00:41:35.060 --> 00:41:36.060]   Are you sorry?
[00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:37.060]   No, I'm not sorry.
[00:41:37.060 --> 00:41:41.940]   I don't think six months would have been a long, long time to use the iPad Pro as my
[00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:43.180]   sole mobile device.
[00:41:43.180 --> 00:41:46.540]   I'm sure I could have done it though, but it would have been a long time for me not to
[00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:47.740]   have a Macbook Pro.
[00:41:47.740 --> 00:41:48.740]   Yeah.
[00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:53.660]   And the price is steep.
[00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:56.820]   The 32 gig is 749.
[00:41:56.820 --> 00:42:00.620]   That's a limited use device probably for more for a corporate environment.
[00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:01.620]   You don't want that.
[00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:04.620]   Also, this interesting thing where Apple is now making Apple used to it famously under
[00:42:04.620 --> 00:42:05.620]   Steve Jobs.
[00:42:05.620 --> 00:42:09.820]   They had those four quadrants, you know, desktop laptop professional and now they have a bunch
[00:42:09.820 --> 00:42:11.380]   of like you said, niche products.
[00:42:11.380 --> 00:42:12.900]   And the Macbook really isn't for everyone.
[00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:14.740]   And the iPad Pro really isn't for everyone.
[00:42:14.740 --> 00:42:16.980]   And you can see that because some people aren't used to that.
[00:42:16.980 --> 00:42:19.420]   Like, but no, why doesn't this product do what I want?
[00:42:19.420 --> 00:42:22.700]   And well, but there is a Mac Pro for you or there is an iPad mini for you.
[00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:26.100]   And we kind of in condition to always get everything Apple makes or always want everything
[00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:27.100]   Apple makes.
[00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:28.260]   And now you have choices.
[00:42:28.260 --> 00:42:30.740]   It's not this one product will fit everybody.
[00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:34.340]   It's the, you have to start thinking about what your needs are.
[00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:35.340]   Yeah.
[00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:36.340]   Wow.
[00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:39.180]   How much, how much money you got?
[00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:40.180]   I don't think.
[00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:41.660]   How many people can afford?
[00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:45.780]   I mean, I spent 2000 books, close to 2000 bucks on my Macbook.
[00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:50.420]   And then here I was here, I am popping another 1000 bucks for this iPad and it'll all work
[00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:55.180]   out because I'm going to be writing stuff about about the iPad and that'll knock down
[00:42:55.180 --> 00:42:56.180]   the price a little bit.
[00:42:56.180 --> 00:42:59.700]   But first and foremost, my mind has to be that there's not a whole lot of people who
[00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:01.580]   can take a thousand dollar flutter on a device.
[00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:07.140]   They're not really sure it's going to do anything's important for them.
[00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:10.380]   I'm stuck with one because I bought it.
[00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:12.300]   Oh, a horrible thing to be stuck with.
[00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:13.300]   Well, exactly.
[00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:20.180]   You know, had it been my own money and well, it is my own money, but had it had it.
[00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:23.460]   How do you put it running Simpsons the entire time, whatever other computer you have, just
[00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:25.180]   leave it next to your running Simpsons.
[00:43:25.180 --> 00:43:26.180]   It's a, it's yeah.
[00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:29.260]   I mean, and that's another thing, by the way, this would, this would work with the software
[00:43:29.260 --> 00:43:32.380]   that allows you to do it as a second screen with your Mac, right?
[00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:33.380]   It's so great.
[00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:34.380]   It's finity.
[00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:35.380]   We're showing it off.
[00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:37.100]   You just, you can start drawing on it and you can draw right into photo.
[00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:39.100]   It's a Photoshop instead of having to use a centique.
[00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:40.100]   Wow.
[00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:41.100]   Yeah.
[00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:44.100]   There are a couple of really, which apps would you recommend?
[00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:45.100]   Look at that.
[00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:46.100]   Do what, do what is my favorite?
[00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:49.260]   It's the one if you, if you are going to be using it as a second display, that's what
[00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:51.620]   I'm using right now, super, super fast.
[00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:54.540]   You can also choose what resolution you want to use if you want to make it even faster.
[00:43:54.540 --> 00:43:56.140]   Hooked up by USB.
[00:43:56.140 --> 00:43:59.540]   It's about as fast as I would expect any external monitor to be.
[00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:00.940]   That's 16 bucks.
[00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:01.940]   That's 16 bucks.
[00:44:01.940 --> 00:44:04.740]   I think Renee was talking about an app called Astro Pad.
[00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:05.740]   Yes.
[00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:07.340]   That Ren was using.
[00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:14.180]   And it's less of a screen, second screen program so much as a mirror part of the part
[00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:19.420]   of your Mac display and make it into a multi-touch input surface that works with Apple Pencil
[00:44:19.420 --> 00:44:20.940]   and works with Bluetooth Pencil.
[00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:21.940]   So you can actually use it.
[00:44:21.940 --> 00:44:25.620]   Renee, we know more than I do about using centique devices in Photoshop and stuff like
[00:44:25.620 --> 00:44:26.620]   that.
[00:44:26.620 --> 00:44:27.620]   Yeah.
[00:44:27.620 --> 00:44:29.900]   Just let's be drawing your iPad and that shows up in Photoshop on your Mac and it's like
[00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:30.900]   the best thing in the universe.
[00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:31.900]   Oh.
[00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:32.900]   It's super fast too.
[00:44:32.900 --> 00:44:34.060]   It's not like there's a lag between the two.
[00:44:34.060 --> 00:44:35.700]   It's just, I don't know.
[00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:39.340]   There's a lot of great apps where at some point when you're reading about it or the person's
[00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:44.740]   telling you about it, the phrase "former Apple engineers works into the conversation" and
[00:44:44.740 --> 00:44:49.540]   that sort of infests all you're thinking about, "Oh, that must be why this is so fast."
[00:44:49.540 --> 00:44:50.540]   And Adobe is super seasoned.
[00:44:50.540 --> 00:44:55.700]   I was using Adobe as screens and I've always used that on my iPhones on my iPads but it's
[00:44:55.700 --> 00:44:56.900]   always been a little bit small.
[00:44:56.900 --> 00:45:00.660]   But now on the iPad Pro, I really have my whole Mac screen in there and it's easy to
[00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:03.060]   tap and do all these sorts of things on it.
[00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:08.140]   By the way, you want to blow people's minds, duet display also works on the windows.
[00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:13.060]   So you could have your iPad Pro sitting next to your windows machine or even better your
[00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:17.780]   surface and really freak people.
[00:45:17.780 --> 00:45:21.700]   And you'd more money than sense, that's for sure.
[00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:24.780]   So I think, you know, stuck with it, you're right.
[00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:25.900]   It's not a good phrase.
[00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:30.380]   I probably would not buy this for myself, not being an artist or a musician, not really
[00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:33.860]   seeing a use case forward or having to do desktop layout.
[00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:38.380]   But now that I have it, it's great for playing Clash of Clans.
[00:45:38.380 --> 00:45:43.380]   If you've always felt the iPad Air, the basic iPad line was great but a little bit too small
[00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:45.260]   for you, you've probably been hangering for this.
[00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:46.260]   Yeah.
[00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:47.260]   Yeah.
[00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:48.260]   It's just fairly specialized.
[00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:53.060]   But do all of the second display programs, you have to connect via a lightning cable,
[00:45:53.060 --> 00:45:54.060]   right?
[00:45:54.060 --> 00:45:55.060]   No.
[00:45:55.060 --> 00:45:58.700]   It also works by Wi-Fi but it's a little bit more laggy over Wi-Fi.
[00:45:58.700 --> 00:46:04.380]   Over lightning, you can't tell the difference between a practically, can't tell the difference
[00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:07.900]   between a Thunderbolt display and this.
[00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:09.380]   This will not work with it though, right?
[00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:14.180]   I mean, I can't use Serenity's solution to glue this onto my...
[00:46:14.180 --> 00:46:17.260]   I don't think this gets big enough to put the...
[00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:18.780]   You're welcome to try it.
[00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:21.140]   I hope you've got a camera running while you try that.
[00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:25.100]   Hey, actually, Jason, could you bring me a lightning cable?
[00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:27.500]   I don't know if you know where one would lie around because I'd like to know this.
[00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:30.740]   The thing that's really cool is the storage controller is so good on this machine.
[00:46:30.740 --> 00:46:35.780]   It's so underrated that it is filling all those CPU and GPU things so fast that you can
[00:46:35.780 --> 00:46:40.140]   do a high-speed transfers in a way you never could on iPads previously.
[00:46:40.140 --> 00:46:41.780]   Well, that's another question.
[00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:42.780]   Apple is...
[00:46:42.780 --> 00:46:44.060]   Oh, by the way, a couple of things.
[00:46:44.060 --> 00:46:48.020]   Tim Cook said, "When I said PC, I met Windows PC.
[00:46:48.020 --> 00:46:49.020]   Keep buying Macs.
[00:46:49.020 --> 00:46:50.420]   I'm a Mac and I'm a PC."
[00:46:50.420 --> 00:46:52.060]   I mean, that's how Apple talks about it.
[00:46:52.060 --> 00:46:54.460]   Well, no, and that's the commonly used verbiage.
[00:46:54.460 --> 00:46:56.700]   It's a PC as a Windows device.
[00:46:56.700 --> 00:46:58.460]   There's PCs in versus Macs, right?
[00:46:58.460 --> 00:46:59.460]   I'm a Mac.
[00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:00.460]   I'm a PC.
[00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:05.620]   But if you're saying we're in a post-PC era, you're not just saying post-Windows era.
[00:47:05.620 --> 00:47:07.180]   It's post-Mac and Windows era.
[00:47:07.180 --> 00:47:08.180]   Let's face it.
[00:47:08.180 --> 00:47:11.220]   That's what the implication is with something like that.
[00:47:11.220 --> 00:47:13.420]   But I think we all agree.
[00:47:13.420 --> 00:47:15.820]   Only in special cases would you want to replace your laptop?
[00:47:15.820 --> 00:47:19.420]   The analogy I use is if you have a bridge, it's an old bridge, but it's a good bridge.
[00:47:19.420 --> 00:47:21.580]   You don't destroy that and then start building a new bridge.
[00:47:21.580 --> 00:47:23.660]   You start building a new bridge in parallel.
[00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:24.660]   Yeah.
[00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:28.100]   You start fitting that bridge until it's so good that people just naturally start using
[00:47:28.100 --> 00:47:29.100]   the new version.
[00:47:29.100 --> 00:47:30.100]   And it's the smartest way to do it.
[00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:35.020]   And since all three of your writers, it sounds like you all three agree that it's a good
[00:47:35.020 --> 00:47:39.180]   for a writer, this might be a reasonable replacement.
[00:47:39.180 --> 00:47:40.180]   And for an artist--
[00:47:40.180 --> 00:47:41.880]   Obviously, for an artist.
[00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:43.340]   As would a mini, okay.
[00:47:43.340 --> 00:47:44.340]   Yeah.
[00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:46.860]   Really, you wouldn't want to write on a mini, would you?
[00:47:46.860 --> 00:47:51.980]   Again, if you think about having a portfolio, like a stable of different hardware, I mean,
[00:47:51.980 --> 00:48:00.820]   to be honest, I've been doing a lot of writing this year just on this iPad mini and a portable
[00:48:00.820 --> 00:48:05.500]   Microsoft keyboard because this will fit into a purse and it's a good way to take advantage
[00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:11.020]   of the 90 minutes that I think I might have between the meeting that I have in town and
[00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:12.660]   the dinner I'm going to be having with a friend afterward.
[00:48:12.660 --> 00:48:16.980]   And you don't necessarily want to be carrying a huge laptop bag wherever you go.
[00:48:16.980 --> 00:48:21.260]   It's really cool to think about-- you've got your notebook that is your real office.
[00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:23.540]   It does all your real work.
[00:48:23.540 --> 00:48:29.140]   Even if it's your iMac or your Mac mini, then you think about how do I best solve the problem
[00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:33.500]   of being able to do work on the road, whether I'm going to be at a coffee shop for two hours
[00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:36.420]   or in New York City for two or three days.
[00:48:36.420 --> 00:48:38.020]   For a lot of people, it's going to be a MacBook Air.
[00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:39.580]   For some people, it's going to be an iPad Pro.
[00:48:39.580 --> 00:48:42.340]   For some people, it might even be an iPad mini.
[00:48:42.340 --> 00:48:46.420]   Just definitely take some time to think about every possible solution.
[00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:50.980]   Define the problem before you buy the thing that's going to be a solution to that problem.
[00:48:50.980 --> 00:48:57.260]   All right, so I've installed-- I probably should have done this during the show.
[00:48:57.260 --> 00:49:03.780]   I installed Duet on the iPad Pro and on my MacBook.
[00:49:03.780 --> 00:49:11.700]   And now it recognizes it somehow, but it's shrunk my screen a little bit.
[00:49:11.700 --> 00:49:12.700]   Is there a setting?
[00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:17.340]   Yeah, you can go into that performance setting and choose what size display you're going
[00:49:17.340 --> 00:49:18.340]   to be using.
[00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:19.340]   Oh, OK.
[00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:20.340]   OK.
[00:49:20.340 --> 00:49:24.780]   This is display arrangement is probably what I want to do, right?
[00:49:24.780 --> 00:49:26.340]   Well, no, no.
[00:49:26.340 --> 00:49:27.780]   I don't want a mirror.
[00:49:27.780 --> 00:49:28.780]   Do you have it?
[00:49:28.780 --> 00:49:29.780]   That's probably what's going on.
[00:49:29.780 --> 00:49:31.700]   Oh, you know what the big problem is?
[00:49:31.700 --> 00:49:33.020]   Oh, my God.
[00:49:33.020 --> 00:49:38.060]   I got a real problem because I'm also feeding television.
[00:49:38.060 --> 00:49:39.820]   So now I'm feeding too many.
[00:49:39.820 --> 00:49:41.340]   It actually seems to have done something.
[00:49:41.340 --> 00:49:42.340]   I don't know.
[00:49:42.340 --> 00:49:43.660]   I don't know what it is.
[00:49:43.660 --> 00:49:47.140]   Have you launched it on the iPad yet?
[00:49:47.140 --> 00:49:48.140]   Yeah.
[00:49:48.140 --> 00:49:51.420]   What you're seeing is the iPad screen right now, believe it or not.
[00:49:51.420 --> 00:49:53.340]   I don't know why.
[00:49:53.340 --> 00:49:56.340]   Yeah, you're seeing me.
[00:49:56.340 --> 00:49:58.500]   Oh, that's green that you were showing, Jason.
[00:49:58.500 --> 00:50:00.500]   I think that's the iPad screen.
[00:50:00.500 --> 00:50:03.340]   Maybe not.
[00:50:03.340 --> 00:50:06.140]   Try moving the mouse using a trackpad on the machine.
[00:50:06.140 --> 00:50:08.460]   Oh, my God.
[00:50:08.460 --> 00:50:09.460]   That's weird.
[00:50:09.460 --> 00:50:11.900]   So now this is a this is like my laptop display.
[00:50:11.900 --> 00:50:15.980]   Oh, it is because I see I have system preferences and all of that stuff.
[00:50:15.980 --> 00:50:16.980]   Yeah.
[00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:19.300]   So I gather my windows while I may.
[00:50:19.300 --> 00:50:21.500]   Inception, you don't have to cut your way out.
[00:50:21.500 --> 00:50:24.180]   And then so this is this is a three screen solution.
[00:50:24.180 --> 00:50:25.380]   I guess I could do that.
[00:50:25.380 --> 00:50:26.380]   Let's see.
[00:50:26.380 --> 00:50:28.140]   Try open mission control.
[00:50:28.140 --> 00:50:31.020]   I don't even know how to do that.
[00:50:31.020 --> 00:50:35.540]   Open mission control on my desktop, right?
[00:50:35.540 --> 00:50:36.540]   Okay.
[00:50:36.540 --> 00:50:37.540]   Yeah.
[00:50:37.540 --> 00:50:40.740]   Are you seeing two different desktops?
[00:50:40.740 --> 00:50:44.140]   I actually, yeah, we have I have two different desktops.
[00:50:44.140 --> 00:50:46.260]   So I should choose desktop.
[00:50:46.260 --> 00:50:47.260]   I don't know.
[00:50:47.260 --> 00:50:48.260]   My mouse is die.
[00:50:48.260 --> 00:50:49.860]   Oh, no, my mouse is connected to the.
[00:50:49.860 --> 00:50:50.980]   Oh, my God.
[00:50:50.980 --> 00:50:52.620]   I've ruined it.
[00:50:52.620 --> 00:50:53.620]   Oh, my God.
[00:50:53.620 --> 00:50:55.900]   I have four desktops.
[00:50:55.900 --> 00:50:57.340]   So I don't know.
[00:50:57.340 --> 00:51:01.620]   So I should move the menus like the source menu back is a Mac, right?
[00:51:01.620 --> 00:51:03.140]   And then, then, then, then, then.
[00:51:03.140 --> 00:51:04.140]   Sorry, I started.
[00:51:04.140 --> 00:51:09.180]   Every time you every time you run another app, you create two more displays.
[00:51:09.180 --> 00:51:12.700]   So if I run an app, well, that where will that app show up?
[00:51:12.700 --> 00:51:13.700]   Nobody knows.
[00:51:13.700 --> 00:51:14.700]   Yeah.
[00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:17.340]   Quantum mechanics dictate that.
[00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:18.980]   It's like, it's throwing your cat.
[00:51:18.980 --> 00:51:24.180]   It should work exactly the same way that any other external screen works.
[00:51:24.180 --> 00:51:25.180]   Yeah.
[00:51:25.180 --> 00:51:26.180]   So it's just an external monitor.
[00:51:26.180 --> 00:51:27.180]   I get it.
[00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:28.580]   Two dimensional snowflake view of a three dimensional hologram.
[00:51:28.580 --> 00:51:31.740]   I will eventually figure this out.
[00:51:31.740 --> 00:51:33.540]   Put the menu bar over here.
[00:51:33.540 --> 00:51:36.460]   Thank you.
[00:51:36.460 --> 00:51:38.300]   Now the menu bar is over there.
[00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:40.380]   And the mouse is back there.
[00:51:40.380 --> 00:51:43.900]   And now the built-in retina display, default for display.
[00:51:43.900 --> 00:51:44.900]   I think I got it.
[00:51:44.900 --> 00:51:45.900]   I think I'm back.
[00:51:45.900 --> 00:51:46.900]   I think I'm back.
[00:51:46.900 --> 00:51:49.460]   I think I've close right or the pattern is full.
[00:51:49.460 --> 00:51:50.460]   There.
[00:51:50.460 --> 00:51:51.460]   Nice.
[00:51:51.460 --> 00:51:52.620]   I don't know what's happened, but I'm here.
[00:51:52.620 --> 00:51:56.140]   I don't know what's happened, but I'm out 18 bucks.
[00:51:56.140 --> 00:51:57.140]   But I love the idea.
[00:51:57.140 --> 00:52:00.340]   I love the idea that now, I mean, this is 12.9 inches.
[00:52:00.340 --> 00:52:01.820]   This isn't having an iPad.
[00:52:01.820 --> 00:52:03.500]   You know, this is a big screen.
[00:52:03.500 --> 00:52:09.260]   This is, so now I almost have the same size screens dual displays here.
[00:52:09.260 --> 00:52:14.300]   It's also a little bit nostalgic because remember the FET screen is actually bigger than my retina
[00:52:14.300 --> 00:52:15.300]   Mac.
[00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:17.700]   It's not a wide screen aspect ratio.
[00:52:17.700 --> 00:52:25.460]   It's Academy aspect ratio, which is fun when I've got a rip of the Blu-ray of the bandwagon
[00:52:25.460 --> 00:52:29.900]   from 1954, beautiful transfer of Academy aspect ratio.
[00:52:29.900 --> 00:52:35.180]   I'm used to seeing window boxing in this and to see this huge, huge, huge thing.
[00:52:35.180 --> 00:52:36.540]   It looks like IMAX to me.
[00:52:36.540 --> 00:52:39.580]   This looks like IMAX ratio to me.
[00:52:39.580 --> 00:52:40.580]   It's a scene, man.
[00:52:40.580 --> 00:52:42.660]   It's a comic book that are amazing on this thing.
[00:52:42.660 --> 00:52:43.940]   They are so great.
[00:52:43.940 --> 00:52:45.940]   What is comic books?
[00:52:45.940 --> 00:52:46.940]   Oh, yeah.
[00:52:46.940 --> 00:52:51.140]   As a matter of fact, I never get into comic books.
[00:52:51.140 --> 00:52:53.260]   You guys do the comic books.
[00:52:53.260 --> 00:52:54.900]   I'm going to do the music.
[00:52:54.900 --> 00:53:00.740]   So I'm going to install some guitar apps and in a tar hero and be awesome on this.
[00:53:00.740 --> 00:53:03.100]   Well, garage band looks almost full size, Jim.
[00:53:03.100 --> 00:53:04.100]   Yeah.
[00:53:04.100 --> 00:53:05.100]   Yeah.
[00:53:05.100 --> 00:53:06.100]   It's going to be great.
[00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:07.100]   Almost for certain--
[00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:08.100]   Specialized uses.
[00:53:08.100 --> 00:53:09.100]   This is great.
[00:53:09.100 --> 00:53:10.100]   Now, this is not supposed to happen, though.
[00:53:10.100 --> 00:53:12.340]   I don't think what is happening right now.
[00:53:12.340 --> 00:53:14.100]   Unless my eyesight is going.
[00:53:14.100 --> 00:53:17.100]   Oh, did you put a quarter in for the magic for me?
[00:53:17.100 --> 00:53:20.300]   That's the quarter of the painting.
[00:53:20.300 --> 00:53:22.500]   That's the Requiem for a Dream filter.
[00:53:22.500 --> 00:53:24.740]   Oh, nice.
[00:53:24.740 --> 00:53:26.500]   That's when I turned on mirroring that happen.
[00:53:26.500 --> 00:53:28.980]   I think it just got unhappy about the--
[00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:31.620]   It's version of stop.
[00:53:31.620 --> 00:53:32.620]   Yeah.
[00:53:32.620 --> 00:53:37.340]   It got BMD optimized for built-in retina display.
[00:53:37.340 --> 00:53:38.340]   OK.
[00:53:38.340 --> 00:53:39.860]   That stopped it.
[00:53:39.860 --> 00:53:40.940]   This is cool.
[00:53:40.940 --> 00:53:43.340]   This was designed by former Apple engineers.
[00:53:43.340 --> 00:53:44.340]   Indeed.
[00:53:44.340 --> 00:53:45.340]   Yeah.
[00:53:45.340 --> 00:53:46.340]   OK.
[00:53:46.340 --> 00:53:49.060]   And that's the built-in display.
[00:53:49.060 --> 00:53:50.540]   Best for built-in display.
[00:53:50.540 --> 00:53:52.540]   There we go.
[00:53:52.540 --> 00:53:53.540]   Mm.
[00:53:53.540 --> 00:53:58.460]   I will say that there might be one or two rough edges.
[00:53:58.460 --> 00:54:01.100]   The only times I've had to screw up on me--
[00:54:01.100 --> 00:54:06.420]   The only time Zuet has screwed up on me when I have tried to unplug and re-plug it in,
[00:54:06.420 --> 00:54:07.420]   unexpectedly.
[00:54:07.420 --> 00:54:09.660]   But it's one of those things where you get it working.
[00:54:09.660 --> 00:54:10.660]   It's going to work.
[00:54:10.660 --> 00:54:11.660]   I just have to get it working.
[00:54:11.660 --> 00:54:12.660]   Once it works, it's working.
[00:54:12.660 --> 00:54:16.060]   And it's also pretty well polished, where even if you've got it set up as an external
[00:54:16.060 --> 00:54:21.100]   display, if you rotate it from landscape to the portrait, it will actually change--
[00:54:21.100 --> 00:54:25.580]   without rebooting, it will change into a portrait aspect ratio, back external display.
[00:54:25.580 --> 00:54:27.500]   Oh, that's super cool.
[00:54:27.500 --> 00:54:28.500]   It's a scene, man.
[00:54:28.500 --> 00:54:29.500]   It's a scene, man.
[00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:30.820]   My mistake was trying to do this.
[00:54:30.820 --> 00:54:35.100]   I forgot I've already got a second display, which is so the camera can see.
[00:54:35.100 --> 00:54:36.100]   So that's--
[00:54:36.100 --> 00:54:38.100]   I mean, that's not what I'm trying to do.
[00:54:38.100 --> 00:54:39.100]   I will say, Conception Leo.
[00:54:39.100 --> 00:54:42.980]   I will say, you've used the duet menu bar dropdown.
[00:54:42.980 --> 00:54:46.620]   This is one of those apps where I really wish there were explicit buttons that say, okay,
[00:54:46.620 --> 00:54:50.060]   please try to connect to the display now, or please try to reconnect to the display now,
[00:54:50.060 --> 00:54:53.980]   because there are times where you need to either resurface an error or say, I don't
[00:54:53.980 --> 00:54:56.060]   know what-- Andy, I don't know why you're upset about it.
[00:54:56.060 --> 00:54:58.220]   As far as I can see, everything's connected, and it's working great.
[00:54:58.220 --> 00:55:00.140]   Okay, you think so?
[00:55:00.140 --> 00:55:01.140]   Incredible.
[00:55:01.140 --> 00:55:02.140]   Just incredible.
[00:55:02.140 --> 00:55:05.980]   Yeah, I mean, I think it's one of those things where it's a big bite, especially if
[00:55:05.980 --> 00:55:12.380]   you get the pencil and a keyboard, because it's $9.49 plus $150 to $170, depending on
[00:55:12.380 --> 00:55:13.900]   whose keyboard you get.
[00:55:13.900 --> 00:55:16.060]   Plus how much is the pencil and another $100?
[00:55:16.060 --> 00:55:19.020]   $99 bucks, yeah.
[00:55:19.020 --> 00:55:22.140]   So at that point, you could actually-- that's a MacBook price.
[00:55:22.140 --> 00:55:24.260]   You could buy a MacBook for that price.
[00:55:24.260 --> 00:55:30.420]   You could, again, or any pretty much Andy Windows notebook with the touch on the display.
[00:55:30.420 --> 00:55:32.580]   The problem with that is you have to use Windows.
[00:55:32.580 --> 00:55:33.580]   That's the only negative.
[00:55:33.580 --> 00:55:34.580]   Exactly.
[00:55:34.580 --> 00:55:36.620]   That's not a plus for Mac users.
[00:55:36.620 --> 00:55:37.620]   Yeah.
[00:55:37.620 --> 00:55:43.700]   For PC users, I've been trying to talk to real people actually use PCs and love them,
[00:55:43.700 --> 00:55:44.860]   if I can find any.
[00:55:44.860 --> 00:55:46.220]   I'm sorry, that's a smart--
[00:55:46.220 --> 00:55:47.780]   Oh, you are so--
[00:55:47.780 --> 00:55:48.780]   But, Jim--
[00:55:48.780 --> 00:55:54.220]   But, I mean, again, I try to imagine the parallel universe in which I'm as enthusiastic
[00:55:54.220 --> 00:55:58.020]   a Windows user as I am in reality as a Mac user.
[00:55:58.020 --> 00:56:02.140]   And if I would be even interested in having two separate devices, something that's been
[00:56:02.140 --> 00:56:05.420]   really hitting me over and over again, as I've been spending more time with this iPad
[00:56:05.420 --> 00:56:11.700]   Pro, is that it reminds me of so much stuff that I would really love to see in the MacBook,
[00:56:11.700 --> 00:56:16.460]   including being able to unlock the device just by-- just with the fingerprint.
[00:56:16.460 --> 00:56:21.500]   Even multi-touch on a screen that I'm using as a notebook type screen would be such a
[00:56:21.500 --> 00:56:22.500]   cool thing.
[00:56:22.500 --> 00:56:27.460]   It just really points out-- not places where Apple's missing the boat, but technologies
[00:56:27.460 --> 00:56:32.620]   that I think would really enhance the Mac that may or may never actually arrive there.
[00:56:32.620 --> 00:56:35.660]   All right, let's take a break.
[00:56:35.660 --> 00:56:37.900]   Oh, I guess one more question.
[00:56:37.900 --> 00:56:43.020]   Now that you guys have both-- have all three had it for some time, I've only had it since
[00:56:43.020 --> 00:56:44.180]   Thursday.
[00:56:44.180 --> 00:56:45.180]   Battery life.
[00:56:45.180 --> 00:56:46.180]   Phenomenal.
[00:56:46.180 --> 00:56:47.180]   Super.
[00:56:47.180 --> 00:56:48.180]   Yeah.
[00:56:48.180 --> 00:56:49.180]   Yeah.
[00:56:49.180 --> 00:56:53.220]   I think getting-- I can count on one hour for every 10%.
[00:56:53.220 --> 00:56:57.820]   And in many cases, I mean, I was just noodling around and sketching.
[00:56:57.820 --> 00:57:01.140]   And it seemed to take forever for it to go from 100% to 98%.
[00:57:01.140 --> 00:57:03.220]   It's super, super battery life.
[00:57:03.220 --> 00:57:08.020]   And it's not even-- I fix it to tear down, of course, of what was in there.
[00:57:08.020 --> 00:57:09.020]   And they were surprised.
[00:57:09.020 --> 00:57:12.300]   They were expecting to see-- it was just-- they were expecting to see nothing but battery
[00:57:12.300 --> 00:57:13.300]   in there.
[00:57:13.300 --> 00:57:17.740]   And they realized that they willingly-- Apple willingly traded off battery life, capacity
[00:57:17.740 --> 00:57:20.860]   for battery, to put in those amazing speakers.
[00:57:20.860 --> 00:57:24.220]   They've just kind of realized that, look, if people are getting 10, 11, 12 hours, they
[00:57:24.220 --> 00:57:25.220]   must be happy with it.
[00:57:25.220 --> 00:57:27.180]   But they're always going to be happy with these speakers.
[00:57:27.180 --> 00:57:28.180]   So let's think about that.
[00:57:28.180 --> 00:57:31.980]   Well, if you think about it, the real estate for the battery in here is at least 50% bigger
[00:57:31.980 --> 00:57:34.020]   than the real estate for an iPad Air 3.
[00:57:34.020 --> 00:57:35.020]   Yeah.
[00:57:35.020 --> 00:57:38.380]   And also, battery is much heavier than the empty speaker.
[00:57:38.380 --> 00:57:39.380]   Yeah.
[00:57:39.380 --> 00:57:40.380]   That's true too.
[00:57:40.380 --> 00:57:41.700]   So they've got a lot more battery life.
[00:57:41.700 --> 00:57:46.980]   They were willing to-- I think there's a 35-- what is it?
[00:57:46.980 --> 00:57:48.660]   8.5 watt hour battery in here?
[00:57:48.660 --> 00:57:50.140]   I mean, it's like a MacBook battery.
[00:57:50.140 --> 00:57:51.580]   It's the same as a MacBook battery.
[00:57:51.580 --> 00:57:52.580]   Yeah.
[00:57:52.580 --> 00:57:57.580]   But because it's a much faster processor, I'm not sure what the wattage is on the processor,
[00:57:57.580 --> 00:58:00.900]   but it's a pretty high wattage processor for an ARM processor.
[00:58:00.900 --> 00:58:03.820]   Big screen, lots of pixels, doing a lot of work.
[00:58:03.820 --> 00:58:07.700]   The architecture between a MacBook and an iPad are getting-- they're not the same, but
[00:58:07.700 --> 00:58:10.220]   they're getting really-- those terms of storage controllers and PC.
[00:58:10.220 --> 00:58:11.220]   They're getting incredibly close.
[00:58:11.220 --> 00:58:13.540]   There was a rumor that Intel was in the running.
[00:58:13.540 --> 00:58:14.900]   Intel, at least that it was in the running.
[00:58:14.900 --> 00:58:16.220]   I can't believe that's true.
[00:58:16.220 --> 00:58:17.820]   I don't understand that article.
[00:58:17.820 --> 00:58:21.260]   Because Patrick Moore is a smart guy, and that article was not a smart article.
[00:58:21.260 --> 00:58:22.260]   It's not possible.
[00:58:22.260 --> 00:58:23.860]   It was the opposite of a smart article.
[00:58:23.860 --> 00:58:24.860]   Yeah.
[00:58:24.860 --> 00:58:30.300]   Intel may want people to think that the 4M would be suitable for an iPad Pro, but I
[00:58:30.300 --> 00:58:35.340]   can't imagine Apple really considering that, especially when they have their own chip design,
[00:58:35.340 --> 00:58:41.180]   the A9X, no reason for them to abandon their system on a chip and start over with an Intel
[00:58:41.180 --> 00:58:42.180]   system.
[00:58:42.180 --> 00:58:43.180]   Intel has an amazing fab.
[00:58:43.180 --> 00:58:46.740]   They probably have the best bar none fab in the world, but Apple is giving them a run
[00:58:46.740 --> 00:58:49.380]   for the money in terms of chip design these days.
[00:58:49.380 --> 00:58:50.380]   Yeah.
[00:58:50.380 --> 00:58:51.380]   Yep.
[00:58:51.380 --> 00:58:52.780]   That was another factor in my own decision.
[00:58:52.780 --> 00:58:59.660]   I really think the A9X both-- realize that Apple is designing a CPU specifically for this
[00:58:59.660 --> 00:59:04.740]   device, and they're designing every single component around that CPU, and they're designing
[00:59:04.740 --> 00:59:10.540]   the operating system around the CPU and around the support hardware, which may or may not
[00:59:10.540 --> 00:59:14.420]   yield better performance than a Core i5 or i7.
[00:59:14.420 --> 00:59:18.140]   But I do think it'll yield better performance than the Core M processor that would be in
[00:59:18.140 --> 00:59:21.300]   the price-competitive version of the Surface Pro 4.
[00:59:21.300 --> 00:59:26.580]   The Surface Pro 4 that costs about as much as an iPad Pro is the Core M version.
[00:59:26.580 --> 00:59:30.100]   You have to spend X or $200 or $300 for the i5 and the i7 version.
[00:59:30.100 --> 00:59:32.980]   You really are getting a lot of bang for the buck.
[00:59:32.980 --> 00:59:37.180]   I've been really trying to make this thing cry over the past three or four days with all
[00:59:37.180 --> 00:59:39.740]   kinds of things that it's just not meant to do.
[00:59:39.740 --> 00:59:45.580]   And the only time where it felt a little bit slow was when I was exporting a 45-minute
[00:59:45.580 --> 00:59:52.580]   HD video from iMovie, and I suppose it was slower than it would have taken on the MacBook
[00:59:52.580 --> 00:59:55.500]   that would have taken a good hunk of time.
[00:59:55.500 --> 00:59:58.060]   So you just don't feel any delay in any reason.
[00:59:58.060 --> 01:00:00.140]   Again, I'm not just running-- I'm not running calculator here.
[01:00:00.140 --> 01:00:02.700]   I'm trying to really make this thing cry.
[01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:03.700]   Yeah.
[01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:06.900]   And we'd-- we-- Serenity did some comparisons between this and a fairly recent MacBook, and
[01:00:06.900 --> 01:00:11.140]   the ability to just do three streams of 4K that you just was not possible.
[01:00:11.140 --> 01:00:12.140]   Wow.
[01:00:12.140 --> 01:00:14.700]   And it's-- because this is an optimized chip, like they can make this chip do exactly what
[01:00:14.700 --> 01:00:15.700]   they want.
[01:00:15.700 --> 01:00:16.700]   The chip is not generic.
[01:00:16.700 --> 01:00:19.860]   It's not like something they get off the shelf that everybody uses that might have code
[01:00:19.860 --> 01:00:23.860]   that makes direct X run better that they have absolutely no need for.
[01:00:23.860 --> 01:00:27.700]   It's something that just has exactly what they want, and it's completely matched, and
[01:00:27.700 --> 01:00:29.860]   that has significant advantages for them.
[01:00:29.860 --> 01:00:31.100]   All right.
[01:00:31.100 --> 01:00:33.340]   Let's take a break more to talk about.
[01:00:33.340 --> 01:00:34.860]   As always, lots more to talk about.
[01:00:34.860 --> 01:00:35.860]   We got a great panel though.
[01:00:35.860 --> 01:00:41.020]   Jim Dalrymple is here from the loop, loopinsight.com.
[01:00:41.020 --> 01:00:42.780]   Renee Richie from imore.com.
[01:00:42.780 --> 01:00:50.020]   Andy Enochko from the Chicago Sun Times or show today brought to you by audible.com.
[01:00:50.020 --> 01:00:55.260]   I probably-- you know, pretty soon we won't have to do ads for them.
[01:00:55.260 --> 01:00:56.260]   Right?
[01:00:56.260 --> 01:00:58.700]   Because we just say audible.
[01:00:58.700 --> 01:00:59.700]   You remember, right?
[01:00:59.700 --> 01:01:00.700]   Right.
[01:01:00.700 --> 01:01:01.700]   Okay.
[01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:05.740]   If you're not a member, I don't understand what's been keeping you.
[01:01:05.740 --> 01:01:10.340]   I think at this point, really, what we'd like to do with the audible ads is presume that
[01:01:10.340 --> 01:01:14.100]   you're a member and now tell you about some great books you could get if you're a member.
[01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:18.940]   If you're not, of course, it's a great way to go to audible.com/macbreak.
[01:01:18.940 --> 01:01:21.140]   You're going to get an audio book free for 30 days.
[01:01:21.140 --> 01:01:23.260]   Actually, the book is yours forever.
[01:01:23.260 --> 01:01:28.260]   You get the 30-day free trial offer of the Audible Gold Plan.
[01:01:28.260 --> 01:01:33.620]   It's a book or a credit for a book a month plus the Daily Digest of the New York Times
[01:01:33.620 --> 01:01:34.780]   of the Wall Street Journal.
[01:01:34.780 --> 01:01:37.060]   It's a great way to get started.
[01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:40.940]   In fact, I'm a little jealous because here you can try it for free, but they're smart
[01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:44.740]   to do that because I think if you haven't started with audible yet, it's probably because
[01:01:44.740 --> 01:01:49.780]   you're thinking, "I don't know if I want to listen to books.
[01:01:49.780 --> 01:01:51.220]   Trust me.
[01:01:51.220 --> 01:01:52.660]   You want to listen to books."
[01:01:52.660 --> 01:01:55.860]   They come alive in unique and interesting ways.
[01:01:55.860 --> 01:02:02.940]   In fact, there's things an audio book can do that a book on paper or on your e-reader
[01:02:02.940 --> 01:02:05.980]   or on your iPad just cannot do.
[01:02:05.980 --> 01:02:07.460]   I'll give you an example.
[01:02:07.460 --> 01:02:12.460]   One of the books here, The Magic Strings of Frankie Presto.
[01:02:12.460 --> 01:02:17.100]   I actually really liked Mitch Oblum's first books.
[01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:19.580]   They were really awesome.
[01:02:19.580 --> 01:02:21.940]   What is it?
[01:02:21.940 --> 01:02:24.260]   Tuesdays with Morrie, I think was the first one.
[01:02:24.260 --> 01:02:28.500]   I haven't heard this one, but this is an example because this is not just somebody reading
[01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:29.660]   it.
[01:02:29.660 --> 01:02:34.900]   This is a performance with multiple narrators, a full cast performance.
[01:02:34.900 --> 01:02:38.340]   Jazz Trumpeter, Marcus Belgrave and his quintet.
[01:02:38.340 --> 01:02:39.340]   And so...
[01:02:39.340 --> 01:02:43.500]   Rachelle's band, Sideman with McCoy Tiner, Dizzy Gillespie, Ella Fitzgerald and all of
[01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:44.500]   that.
[01:02:44.500 --> 01:02:45.500]   It's like you're going to the theater, almost.
[01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:48.780]   The theater of your mind where you're hearing.
[01:02:48.780 --> 01:02:53.380]   Mitch Oblum, Roger McGwin is on this narrating, Ingrid Michelson, John Pitzer, Relly Paul,
[01:02:53.380 --> 01:02:54.860]   Stanley, George Guidol.
[01:02:54.860 --> 01:02:57.420]   Some of these names you might not recognize, you will if you're an Audible fan.
[01:02:57.420 --> 01:03:00.940]   These are some of their best readers, Mike Hodge, Robin Miles.
[01:03:00.940 --> 01:03:04.860]   So they've got these great readers bringing books to life.
[01:03:04.860 --> 01:03:10.020]   And I swear, when I listened to The Martian, I feel like I saw the movie before the movie
[01:03:10.020 --> 01:03:11.700]   was even made.
[01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:13.780]   And that's what's so great about Audible.
[01:03:13.780 --> 01:03:15.460]   So there's my cell.
[01:03:15.460 --> 01:03:17.900]   If you haven't yet, Elvis Costello has a new one.
[01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:20.100]   Unfaithful music and disappearing ink.
[01:03:20.100 --> 01:03:25.020]   If you're a fan of musicians, Audible's such a great place to hear their biographies.
[01:03:25.020 --> 01:03:28.420]   And in this case, red by Elvis Costello.
[01:03:28.420 --> 01:03:29.420]   Declan Dennman.
[01:03:29.420 --> 01:03:31.420]   You have to get that one.
[01:03:31.420 --> 01:03:33.020]   Yeah, I'm a huge fan.
[01:03:33.020 --> 01:03:36.460]   18 hours, I like to see that.
[01:03:36.460 --> 01:03:40.700]   The basement dwelling at 46A, Avon Moore Road was my first family home.
[01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:42.980]   Oh, see you, don't you really want to hear that?
[01:03:42.980 --> 01:03:43.980]   Awesome.
[01:03:43.980 --> 01:03:46.740]   Okay, Audible.com/MacBreakFirstBooksFree.
[01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:49.100]   Now Andy, what are you listening to?
[01:03:49.100 --> 01:03:50.420]   I love Andy's recommendations.
[01:03:50.420 --> 01:03:56.620]   I just finished Tim Gunn's latest memoir or nonfiction book called Tim Gunn, the Natty
[01:03:56.620 --> 01:04:00.980]   Professor, a masterclass on mentoring, motivating and making it work.
[01:04:00.980 --> 01:04:03.340]   We know you're a fan of Project Runway.
[01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:04.860]   Well, not just that.
[01:04:04.860 --> 01:04:06.220]   I'm a big fan of Tim Gunn.
[01:04:06.220 --> 01:04:07.220]   He's a character.
[01:04:07.220 --> 01:04:08.220]   I do.
[01:04:08.220 --> 01:04:13.020]   I feel as though when Mr. Rogers passed away, there was some sort of spirit of television
[01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:18.700]   kindness that was up in the ether that Tim Gunn decided to pick up and carry into his
[01:04:18.700 --> 01:04:19.700]   own TV work.
[01:04:19.700 --> 01:04:24.700]   He's just, and this is the second or third book, and it really carries that through.
[01:04:24.700 --> 01:04:29.340]   The nominal topic is about the on the subject of teaching because of course he spent decades
[01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:34.780]   as a teacher and as a dean at a fashion school of art and design.
[01:04:34.780 --> 01:04:35.780]   But it's interesting.
[01:04:35.780 --> 01:04:39.620]   It's also interspersed with fun stories from his life and his experiences over the past
[01:04:39.620 --> 01:04:41.660]   five or six years.
[01:04:41.660 --> 01:04:47.420]   Enough so that it's not just a book about how to fix the educational system, but it's
[01:04:47.420 --> 01:04:52.860]   also stories about dust ups he's had and experiences, parts of his life that he really
[01:04:52.860 --> 01:04:53.860]   enjoys.
[01:04:53.860 --> 01:04:57.900]   But also the serious parts of it are really, really fun too because they talk about, and
[01:04:57.900 --> 01:05:01.860]   even if you're not a professional teacher, you're often in the position of trying to
[01:05:01.860 --> 01:05:05.860]   mentor somebody or guide somebody, someone is counting on you to teach them how to, you
[01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:10.500]   know, how to do things, whether it's teaching them how to shave or teaching them how to,
[01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:12.860]   you know, get a job and finance a car and this sort of stuff.
[01:05:12.860 --> 01:05:16.500]   It really does talk about with lots of experience from his own experiences.
[01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:19.500]   And I think that's a very important thing to do with the work that he does.
[01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:23.100]   And I think that's a very important thing to do with the work that he does.
[01:05:23.100 --> 01:05:27.100]   And I think that's a very important thing to do with the work that he does.

[01:08:31.460 --> 01:08:33.460]   So this is the Comicsology app.
[01:08:33.460 --> 01:08:37.460]   It also works with Marvel Comics Unlimited.
[01:08:37.460 --> 01:08:39.460]   Actually, this was Marvel Comics Unlimited.
[01:08:39.460 --> 01:08:43.460]   But if you hold it sideways...
[01:08:43.460 --> 01:08:45.460]   Yep, I got it.
[01:08:45.460 --> 01:08:47.460]   Annie needs one more hand.
[01:08:47.460 --> 01:08:49.460]   I'm a prop comic today.
[01:08:49.460 --> 01:08:53.460]   If you hold it sideways, it's even bigger.
[01:08:53.460 --> 01:08:59.460]   And it's roughly the same size as the original art that the comic was based on.
[01:08:59.460 --> 01:09:01.460]   Oh, you have the original art, so...
[01:09:01.460 --> 01:09:03.460]   I have the original art.
[01:09:03.460 --> 01:09:05.460]   I had to dig through my basement.
[01:09:05.460 --> 01:09:07.460]   I'm still sneezing because this is the first time I've looked through
[01:09:07.460 --> 01:09:11.460]   for actual comic books in my collection in a long, long time.
[01:09:11.460 --> 01:09:15.460]   That's cool, though, because you're seeing basically what the art is true.
[01:09:15.460 --> 01:09:19.460]   Exactly. And on Comicsology, this is the Marvel app, and it's not as high-resolution.
[01:09:19.460 --> 01:09:23.460]   But in the Comicsology app, it's Ultra Ultra High Resolution.
[01:09:23.460 --> 01:09:27.460]   So, I'm sorry, I'm having a experiment in three-body physics here.
[01:09:27.460 --> 01:09:31.460]   And I'm not sure if you're looking at the original comic book art.
[01:09:31.460 --> 01:09:33.460]   It's just...
[01:09:33.460 --> 01:09:37.460]   Like I said, the very, very top, and I know we're about to move on.
[01:09:37.460 --> 01:09:39.460]   But for me, it wasn't...
[01:09:39.460 --> 01:09:43.460]   I'm going to spend $1,000 on this one thing.
[01:09:43.460 --> 01:09:45.460]   It really comes down to...
[01:09:45.460 --> 01:09:47.460]   I should almost open up a spreadsheet that says,
[01:09:47.460 --> 01:09:49.460]   "I'm paying $80 for the best comic book reader ever.
[01:09:49.460 --> 01:09:53.460]   I'm spending $110 for a second display for my MacBook.
[01:09:53.460 --> 01:09:57.460]   I'm spending $200 for a portable computer on and on and on.
[01:09:57.460 --> 01:10:00.460]   It adds up to, for me, way more than $1,000.
[01:10:00.460 --> 01:10:02.460]   So, it was a very good purchase for me.
[01:10:02.460 --> 01:10:06.460]   I was rereading Planetarium iBooks yesterday on the plane, and it was fantastic, too,
[01:10:06.460 --> 01:10:09.460]   because you can look at it side-by-side like a regular comic book,
[01:10:09.460 --> 01:10:12.460]   or you can just turn it and suddenly you have the absolute edition right away.
[01:10:12.460 --> 01:10:13.460]   Yeah.
[01:10:13.460 --> 01:10:15.460]   So, reading...
[01:10:15.460 --> 01:10:17.460]   Have you read an iBooks?
[01:10:17.460 --> 01:10:22.460]   Are you now just reading them horizontally because you can actually get two-page spreads
[01:10:22.460 --> 01:10:23.460]   like used in the olden days?
[01:10:23.460 --> 01:10:24.460]   It's like a real book.
[01:10:24.460 --> 01:10:28.460]   I tried, but then I'm getting older, so I wanted bigger, so I go back to board.
[01:10:28.460 --> 01:10:33.460]   It really is the same size as the large-sized print library collection,
[01:10:33.460 --> 01:10:37.460]   those weird Robert Ludlam tabloid-sized books with...
[01:10:37.460 --> 01:10:38.460]   Oh, God.
[01:10:38.460 --> 01:10:39.460]   We're old men, Renee.
[01:10:39.460 --> 01:10:40.460]   We're old men.
[01:10:40.460 --> 01:10:41.460]   I can write a...
[01:10:41.460 --> 01:10:45.460]   It's old, but reading comic books, okay, comic books from the '80s, but still.
[01:10:45.460 --> 01:10:46.460]   So, here's...
[01:10:46.460 --> 01:10:47.460]   This is...
[01:10:47.460 --> 01:10:49.460]   Let me see here.
[01:10:49.460 --> 01:10:50.460]   I have a book on here.
[01:10:50.460 --> 01:10:53.460]   Here's the Steve Jobs biography in iBooks.
[01:10:53.460 --> 01:10:54.460]   It does.
[01:10:54.460 --> 01:10:55.460]   It's kind of cool.
[01:10:55.460 --> 01:10:56.460]   Yeah.
[01:10:56.460 --> 01:10:57.460]   Yeah.
[01:10:57.460 --> 01:10:58.460]   Wow.
[01:10:58.460 --> 01:10:59.460]   That's kind of nice.
[01:10:59.460 --> 01:11:00.460]   I mean, it's like a real book.
[01:11:00.460 --> 01:11:01.460]   It's like the nine-inch book.
[01:11:01.460 --> 01:11:02.460]   Like the nine-inch...
[01:11:02.460 --> 01:11:05.460]   I forget what they call that book factor that's opened up in front of you.
[01:11:05.460 --> 01:11:06.460]   Yeah.
[01:11:06.460 --> 01:11:08.460]   What you're not going to want to do is read this in bed.
[01:11:08.460 --> 01:11:09.460]   It's way too big.
[01:11:09.460 --> 01:11:11.460]   Your knees are going to fall asleep.
[01:11:11.460 --> 01:11:12.460]   That's...
[01:11:12.460 --> 01:11:15.460]   It's also not a good potty iPad.
[01:11:15.460 --> 01:11:16.460]   I don't think.
[01:11:16.460 --> 01:11:17.460]   It's too big.
[01:11:17.460 --> 01:11:19.460]   I haven't even brought it into that room for that reason.
[01:11:19.460 --> 01:11:20.460]   Yeah.
[01:11:20.460 --> 01:11:21.460]   No.
[01:11:21.460 --> 01:11:23.460]   But living room, fine.
[01:11:23.460 --> 01:11:26.460]   If you have it on a desk, fine.
[01:11:26.460 --> 01:11:27.460]   You just gave me an idea.
[01:11:27.460 --> 01:11:29.460]   I want to go on YouTube and take some measurements.
[01:11:29.460 --> 01:11:33.460]   Is that screen exactly the same size as the knowledge navigator?
[01:11:33.460 --> 01:11:34.460]   Can we finally...
[01:11:34.460 --> 01:11:37.460]   We finally got the knowledge navigator.
[01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:43.460]   If someone kickstarted for a case for the iPad Pro that made it look like a knowledge navigator,
[01:11:43.460 --> 01:11:45.460]   only not foldable, I would...
[01:11:45.460 --> 01:11:50.460]   I'd be funding at at least the t-shirt level and maybe the early bird buying level.
[01:11:50.460 --> 01:11:51.460]   What...
[01:11:51.460 --> 01:11:56.460]   If the Comixology is not called Comixology, which is Comix, right?
[01:11:56.460 --> 01:11:59.460]   If you search for Comixology, you'll find it.
[01:11:59.460 --> 01:12:02.460]   If Comix will turn up that in a whole bunch of other apps.
[01:12:02.460 --> 01:12:03.460]   Okay.
[01:12:03.460 --> 01:12:04.460]   Here's the knowledge navigator.
[01:12:04.460 --> 01:12:06.460]   This was the video, by the way.
[01:12:06.460 --> 01:12:09.460]   I think it's dubbed from a VHS tape.
[01:12:09.460 --> 01:12:11.460]   I have it somewhere on a laser disc.
[01:12:11.460 --> 01:12:13.460]   If I had a laser disc player, I could play it.
[01:12:13.460 --> 01:12:18.460]   The video that was created by Steve Jobs was not at Apple when this was created.
[01:12:18.460 --> 01:12:20.460]   Scully, but there is the knowledge navigator.
[01:12:20.460 --> 01:12:25.460]   This was the vision for the future from somewhere in the mid-90s, I think, right?
[01:12:25.460 --> 01:12:26.460]   Yep.
[01:12:26.460 --> 01:12:27.460]   Yeah.
[01:12:27.460 --> 01:12:28.460]   So there's a lot of squiggly pastels.
[01:12:28.460 --> 01:12:29.460]   Yeah.
[01:12:29.460 --> 01:12:33.460]   He's going into his Denny's mom calls and stuff like that, but let me...
[01:12:33.460 --> 01:12:34.460]   Here it is.
[01:12:34.460 --> 01:12:35.460]   Yes.
[01:12:35.460 --> 01:12:38.460]   See now, that's a full-size knowledge navigator.
[01:12:38.460 --> 01:12:40.460]   God, that's Apple Watch.
[01:12:40.460 --> 01:12:41.460]   There's a loop.
[01:12:41.460 --> 01:12:42.460]   Yeah.
[01:12:42.460 --> 01:12:43.460]   You're the resolution.
[01:12:43.460 --> 01:12:46.460]   And this guy's talking, he says, "Your mother called."
[01:12:46.460 --> 01:12:47.460]   Oh, damn!
[01:12:47.460 --> 01:12:50.460]   But look at all the crap around it.
[01:12:50.460 --> 01:12:52.460]   There's a lot of extra crap around it.
[01:12:52.460 --> 01:12:57.140]   That's a lot of hardware, and that's something I don't think anybody imagined that this would
[01:12:57.140 --> 01:12:58.140]   be all-screen.
[01:12:58.140 --> 01:12:59.460]   Look at all this stuff.
[01:12:59.460 --> 01:13:00.460]   Yeah.
[01:13:00.460 --> 01:13:02.460]   It's kind of amazing.
[01:13:02.460 --> 01:13:03.460]   No movie.
[01:13:03.460 --> 01:13:04.460]   That's why it's...
[01:13:04.460 --> 01:13:08.460]   2001 Space Odyssey was so amazing because it's the only...
[01:13:08.460 --> 01:13:14.220]   It's the only movie that had the boldness to say, "What if we have computers that are just
[01:13:14.220 --> 01:13:18.260]   literally sheets of glass that you can pick up and put anywhere?"
[01:13:18.260 --> 01:13:22.580]   And not just like being a visionary futurist, but if you're designing a prop that has to
[01:13:22.580 --> 01:13:25.460]   communicate to the audience, this is a computer.
[01:13:25.460 --> 01:13:26.460]   Yeah.
[01:13:26.460 --> 01:13:30.140]   Like, how do you have to put that crap around it to make people think that, "Look how technological
[01:13:30.140 --> 01:13:32.740]   it's got blinking lights, it's got spinning knobs."
[01:13:32.740 --> 01:13:37.300]   But no, if technology really advances, it should just be a slate of glass, which they've
[01:13:37.300 --> 01:13:38.300]   actually amazingly...
[01:13:38.300 --> 01:13:40.300]   They've actually done.
[01:13:40.300 --> 01:13:44.100]   Yeah, none of this is functional.
[01:13:44.100 --> 01:13:46.100]   It's just plastic-cuffed.
[01:13:46.100 --> 01:13:49.220]   But you could write that.
[01:13:49.220 --> 01:13:51.300]   You could certainly write that app now.
[01:13:51.300 --> 01:13:52.300]   Yeah.
[01:13:52.300 --> 01:13:53.300]   Oh, yeah.
[01:13:53.300 --> 01:13:55.740]   It's impossible to make money off of apps anyway.
[01:13:55.740 --> 01:13:58.940]   Why not make an intentionally silly app with no purpose like that?
[01:13:58.940 --> 01:13:59.940]   It's like just entertainment value.
[01:13:59.940 --> 01:14:01.420]   It has a tie with a bow tie in it.
[01:14:01.420 --> 01:14:04.340]   And I would give you five bucks for that.
[01:14:04.340 --> 01:14:05.660]   Yeah.
[01:14:05.660 --> 01:14:07.180]   It looks like small talk, actually.
[01:14:07.180 --> 01:14:10.140]   I think it was probably influenced by a small talk because everything was supposed to be
[01:14:10.140 --> 01:14:11.140]   small talk.
[01:14:11.140 --> 01:14:12.140]   Yeah, Alan Kay was still there.
[01:14:12.140 --> 01:14:13.140]   First was modular too.
[01:14:13.140 --> 01:14:14.140]   Yeah.
[01:14:14.140 --> 01:14:15.140]   See, there's the camera.
[01:14:15.140 --> 01:14:16.140]   Look at the size of that thing.
[01:14:16.140 --> 01:14:18.140]   There's the camera on this thing.
[01:14:18.140 --> 01:14:22.940]   For those not just listening, if you search YouTube for knowledge navigator, you can watch
[01:14:22.940 --> 01:14:28.100]   this unintentionally comic video that was created by Apple.
[01:14:28.100 --> 01:14:29.940]   It's just not a recent Adam Listicor video.
[01:14:29.940 --> 01:14:30.940]   This is actually a period.
[01:14:30.940 --> 01:14:31.940]   Yeah.
[01:14:31.940 --> 01:14:33.860]   It does look like Adam Listicor stuff, doesn't it?
[01:14:33.860 --> 01:14:34.860]   Boy, he's doing great stuff.
[01:14:34.860 --> 01:14:35.860]   It's a show.
[01:14:35.860 --> 01:14:36.860]   Yeah.
[01:14:36.860 --> 01:14:37.860]   This has 1987.
[01:14:37.860 --> 01:14:40.940]   So Steve was still at Apple when this was made.
[01:14:40.940 --> 01:14:41.940]   1987.
[01:14:41.940 --> 01:14:44.340]   I'm not sure if he signed off on that though.
[01:14:44.340 --> 01:14:45.740]   I don't know what the story was.
[01:14:45.740 --> 01:14:48.300]   I always thought it was more skully than jobs.
[01:14:48.300 --> 01:14:49.780]   You're in a cycle of fun.
[01:14:49.780 --> 01:14:53.740]   I know that John Louis Gasey was still there because there was a keynote in which as a joke
[01:14:53.740 --> 01:14:57.380]   he played the part of the guy in the bow tie.
[01:14:57.380 --> 01:15:00.300]   I think they switched languages and language.
[01:15:00.300 --> 01:15:02.420]   Then suddenly he starts speaking French and there's John Louis Gasey.
[01:15:02.420 --> 01:15:11.060]   I have it on a laser disc, friend of mine produced for the original TED conferences.
[01:15:11.060 --> 01:15:13.140]   I think that the Sadams has this keynote on that one too.
[01:15:13.140 --> 01:15:14.780]   Yeah, it's a really great laser disc.
[01:15:14.780 --> 01:15:15.780]   I have the same disc.
[01:15:15.780 --> 01:15:16.780]   Yeah.
[01:15:16.780 --> 01:15:18.780]   I wish the guy has something to play at work.
[01:15:18.780 --> 01:15:20.220]   That and the original Star Wars trilogy.
[01:15:20.220 --> 01:15:21.220]   There's no...
[01:15:21.220 --> 01:15:27.860]   I also have a laser disc player in my garage just to play the original trilogy laser discs.
[01:15:27.860 --> 01:15:29.180]   But there's almost no...
[01:15:29.180 --> 01:15:31.620]   Every VHS cassette that I save.
[01:15:31.620 --> 01:15:35.180]   I should just throw every one of them out because if you want...
[01:15:35.180 --> 01:15:38.740]   They never reran the far side Halloween animated special.
[01:15:38.740 --> 01:15:42.460]   I should hold onto this VHS tape and then it's on YouTube.
[01:15:42.460 --> 01:15:43.460]   It's there.
[01:15:43.460 --> 01:15:44.460]   Yeah.
[01:15:44.460 --> 01:15:45.460]   So Apple...
[01:15:45.460 --> 01:15:46.460]   So I stand corrected.
[01:15:46.460 --> 01:15:48.500]   It was a skully production.
[01:15:48.500 --> 01:15:50.900]   As the chairman's telling me, Steve was fired in '85.
[01:15:50.900 --> 01:15:52.780]   I forgot it was that long ago.
[01:15:52.780 --> 01:15:56.020]   All the kids are listening to us talk about laser disc saying what?
[01:15:56.020 --> 01:15:57.020]   What is a laser disc?
[01:15:57.020 --> 01:15:58.020]   Well, imagine...
[01:15:58.020 --> 01:15:59.500]   It's like an album for your TV.
[01:15:59.500 --> 01:16:02.020]   It's the iPad Pro of CDs.
[01:16:02.020 --> 01:16:04.940]   Imagine a CD that's as big as a vinyl record.
[01:16:04.940 --> 01:16:05.940]   What's that?
[01:16:05.940 --> 01:16:06.940]   I don't know.
[01:16:06.940 --> 01:16:08.740]   I can't help you there.
[01:16:08.740 --> 01:16:09.740]   I'll go into the...
[01:16:09.740 --> 01:16:11.900]   I'll go and get a laser disc during the next commercial.
[01:16:11.900 --> 01:16:13.140]   We'll see.
[01:16:13.140 --> 01:16:19.740]   Tim has, by the way, said that we will not converge OS X and iOS.
[01:16:19.740 --> 01:16:21.300]   That's not going to happen.
[01:16:21.300 --> 01:16:22.540]   It's yearly reminder.
[01:16:22.540 --> 01:16:23.540]   Yeah.
[01:16:23.540 --> 01:16:28.020]   Although anything's five years from now, who knows, right?
[01:16:28.020 --> 01:16:30.220]   It might not be running either anymore.
[01:16:30.220 --> 01:16:31.220]   Right.
[01:16:31.220 --> 01:16:32.220]   Yeah.
[01:16:32.220 --> 01:16:36.340]   When he says "converge," he means that, "No, the plan is to stop running the Mac into
[01:16:36.340 --> 01:16:38.220]   the ground and stop making it after 2017."
[01:16:38.220 --> 01:16:39.220]   Yeah, I think that's more accurate.
[01:16:39.220 --> 01:16:40.220]   Don't worry.
[01:16:40.220 --> 01:16:41.220]   Don't worry about convergence.
[01:16:41.220 --> 01:16:42.220]   We have no convergence.
[01:16:42.220 --> 01:16:44.220]   No need.
[01:16:44.220 --> 01:16:48.860]   By the way, which fingers do you register with Touch ID on your iPad Pro?
[01:16:48.860 --> 01:16:49.860]   I just...
[01:16:49.860 --> 01:16:50.860]   I didn't bother with anything but my thumb.
[01:16:50.860 --> 01:16:51.860]   Yeah, same.
[01:16:51.860 --> 01:16:54.620]   It's like, I'm not going to touch it with my index.
[01:16:54.620 --> 01:16:55.620]   It's a thumb.
[01:16:55.620 --> 01:16:56.620]   No, I don't...
[01:16:56.620 --> 01:16:57.780]   I hold it like that.
[01:16:57.780 --> 01:17:03.860]   One of the most popular use cases for me is I would never guess this because I don't use
[01:17:03.860 --> 01:17:05.420]   my other iPads this time.
[01:17:05.420 --> 01:17:10.140]   I'm saying really flat, just flat on the tape.
[01:17:10.140 --> 01:17:13.740]   And just as it's like laying a magazine flat on the table.
[01:17:13.740 --> 01:17:14.740]   Yes.
[01:17:14.740 --> 01:17:17.700]   So you might use the index finger for that.
[01:17:17.700 --> 01:17:18.700]   Beats music.
[01:17:18.700 --> 01:17:19.700]   Bye-bye.
[01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:22.660]   He hardly knew ye.
[01:17:22.660 --> 01:17:23.660]   Apple says it will...
[01:17:23.660 --> 01:17:25.020]   I didn't even know this hadn't happened yet.
[01:17:25.020 --> 01:17:29.060]   Well officially faded out at the end of the month.
[01:17:29.060 --> 01:17:30.060]   No more beats.
[01:17:30.060 --> 01:17:32.180]   I like the Android version of Apple Music is here.
[01:17:32.180 --> 01:17:33.180]   Yeah.
[01:17:33.180 --> 01:17:34.180]   There's no reason for it, right?
[01:17:34.180 --> 01:17:36.860]   Well, Windows phone people get lost, but...
[01:17:36.860 --> 01:17:40.220]   Oh, that is a reason.
[01:17:40.220 --> 01:17:47.700]   And surprisingly, Pandora has just bought the assets of Artio, which is kind of folded.
[01:17:47.700 --> 01:17:48.700]   It stores.
[01:17:48.700 --> 01:17:50.020]   That's a little concerning.
[01:17:50.020 --> 01:17:52.100]   It's a harsh business.
[01:17:52.100 --> 01:17:54.420]   It's a terrible business.
[01:17:54.420 --> 01:17:58.420]   The record industry holds you by the whatever.
[01:17:58.420 --> 01:18:00.700]   And there's not much you can do.
[01:18:00.700 --> 01:18:06.780]   Chapter 11 for Artio and Pandora will buy the assets for $75 million in cash.
[01:18:06.780 --> 01:18:09.020]   I think it's great that they did that.
[01:18:09.020 --> 01:18:10.820]   Thank you, Pandora.
[01:18:10.820 --> 01:18:15.220]   What it shows you though is that Pandora wants to do a streaming service, right, Jim?
[01:18:15.220 --> 01:18:16.220]   Yeah.
[01:18:16.220 --> 01:18:18.980]   I think it's great news.
[01:18:18.980 --> 01:18:19.980]   Yeah.
[01:18:19.980 --> 01:18:20.980]   It really is.
[01:18:20.980 --> 01:18:21.980]   Yeah.
[01:18:21.980 --> 01:18:31.980]   I think Pandora has the best radio, algorithmic radio anywhere.
[01:18:31.980 --> 01:18:33.940]   There is nothing that can be Pandora.
[01:18:33.940 --> 01:18:36.740]   And I've tried every service, including audio.
[01:18:36.740 --> 01:18:40.220]   There is nothing that can be Pandora.
[01:18:40.220 --> 01:18:47.700]   And to think that they're going to take that and the assets of Artio to have on demand and
[01:18:47.700 --> 01:18:51.860]   expand that service, that's going to be incredible.
[01:18:51.860 --> 01:18:52.860]   Take my money.
[01:18:52.860 --> 01:18:53.860]   Take it.
[01:18:53.860 --> 01:18:59.500]   The same questions come up though when we Apple bought Beats, is do the contracts that Artio
[01:18:59.500 --> 01:19:03.060]   has with the labels transfer over to the new owners?
[01:19:03.060 --> 01:19:04.060]   No.
[01:19:04.060 --> 01:19:05.060]   Apparently not.
[01:19:05.060 --> 01:19:06.060]   They have to renegotiate those.
[01:19:06.060 --> 01:19:08.060]   That's correct.
[01:19:08.060 --> 01:19:09.060]   Yeah.
[01:19:09.060 --> 01:19:11.820]   And you know, that's going to be, I mean, they know that going in.
[01:19:11.820 --> 01:19:12.820]   Yeah.
[01:19:12.820 --> 01:19:17.620]   And that's going to be a bit problematic show is it?
[01:19:17.620 --> 01:19:18.620]   Yeah.
[01:19:18.620 --> 01:19:19.620]   I think.
[01:19:19.620 --> 01:19:22.940]   I think industry are easy going guys.
[01:19:22.940 --> 01:19:27.860]   So if we all work together, it seems like a big kerfuffle, but it really isn't just.
[01:19:27.860 --> 01:19:28.860]   Oh, yeah.
[01:19:28.860 --> 01:19:32.900]   Change some names and just have a sandwich together and that will do it.
[01:19:32.900 --> 01:19:33.900]   Come by.
[01:19:33.900 --> 01:19:34.900]   That's their theme song.
[01:19:34.900 --> 01:19:39.820]   There's got to be a way that those two corporate behemas can get together and find
[01:19:39.820 --> 01:19:44.460]   out a way to make sure that artists from the 60s and 70s don't get their proper royalties.
[01:19:44.460 --> 01:19:46.300]   They're united by a common love.
[01:19:46.300 --> 01:19:50.180]   A spring over music.
[01:19:50.180 --> 01:19:59.260]   So Pandora's, I don't know who is this guy is probably COO or CFO.
[01:19:59.260 --> 01:20:05.180]   In the conference call where he talked about this said that they didn't feel that while
[01:20:05.180 --> 01:20:08.900]   we are, they didn't feel that acquiring Artio made any sense.
[01:20:08.900 --> 01:20:13.900]   They acquired their intellectual property, which means basically the software that would
[01:20:13.900 --> 01:20:17.820]   allow them to do a Artio style streaming service.
[01:20:17.820 --> 01:20:22.460]   Brian McAndrews said the company expects to offer an expanded Pandora listening experience
[01:20:22.460 --> 01:20:31.260]   by late next year pending its ability to obtain the proper licenses.
[01:20:31.260 --> 01:20:33.180]   I don't let me see if I can find the number.
[01:20:33.180 --> 01:20:36.260]   I didn't realize this Pandora's also bought ticket fly.
[01:20:36.260 --> 01:20:39.900]   So they do concert ticket sales as well.
[01:20:39.900 --> 01:20:40.900]   I didn't know that.
[01:20:40.900 --> 01:20:41.900]   I didn't know that either.
[01:20:41.900 --> 01:20:46.540]   So Pandora's positioning as any of these companies would be wise to do.
[01:20:46.540 --> 01:20:48.420]   I mean, Apple doesn't have to worry with Apple music.
[01:20:48.420 --> 01:20:53.860]   It's not a core business, but Spotify and Deezer and Tidal and all these others have
[01:20:53.860 --> 01:20:59.660]   to really find other revenue sources because you cannot rely on the record industry.
[01:20:59.660 --> 01:21:01.460]   They don't like you.
[01:21:01.460 --> 01:21:03.460]   No.
[01:21:03.460 --> 01:21:13.420]   Artio was founded by the guy who did Kazza and Skype, Janice Freese, and owned partially
[01:21:13.420 --> 01:21:20.580]   by Radio Cumulus, which is a big radio group, bought a 15% stake at Get Ready for This,
[01:21:20.580 --> 01:21:25.060]   a $500 million valuation two years ago.
[01:21:25.060 --> 01:21:27.020]   Don't think they're getting their money out of that.
[01:21:27.020 --> 01:21:28.460]   Wow, things change.
[01:21:28.460 --> 01:21:30.020]   They really do.
[01:21:30.020 --> 01:21:31.780]   Pandora's struggling too.
[01:21:31.780 --> 01:21:33.500]   Yes.
[01:21:33.500 --> 01:21:36.340]   Pandora has 78 million users, mostly in the US.
[01:21:36.340 --> 01:21:39.740]   Artio, I think, was more of an international success.
[01:21:39.740 --> 01:21:42.900]   You haven't in Canada, right, Renee?
[01:21:42.900 --> 01:21:43.900]   Artio, we did.
[01:21:43.900 --> 01:21:44.900]   Yeah, not Pandora.
[01:21:44.900 --> 01:21:45.900]   Right.
[01:21:45.900 --> 01:21:46.900]   Well, maybe that.
[01:21:46.900 --> 01:21:47.900]   Well, no, let's see.
[01:21:47.900 --> 01:21:49.980]   That's part of the license agreement of the label zone.
[01:21:49.980 --> 01:21:52.180]   Yeah, and they're really hard to negotiate.
[01:21:52.180 --> 01:21:53.180]   Wow.
[01:21:53.180 --> 01:21:54.180]   Yeah.
[01:21:54.180 --> 01:21:57.700]   Artio will be winding down the audio service.
[01:21:57.700 --> 01:22:01.740]   So if you have the app, that's going to be shutting down in the next couple of weeks.
[01:22:01.740 --> 01:22:05.900]   And as I said, there won't be anything from Pandora to replace it for a while.
[01:22:05.900 --> 01:22:08.500]   That's probably good news for Apple.
[01:22:08.500 --> 01:22:10.140]   At least a few people might look to Apple.
[01:22:10.140 --> 01:22:11.660]   Artio really was nice on the iPad.
[01:22:11.660 --> 01:22:12.660]   It was really gorgeous.
[01:22:12.660 --> 01:22:13.660]   Yeah.
[01:22:13.660 --> 01:22:18.060]   And it had communities sharing and I had some nice features that seemed to fit very well
[01:22:18.060 --> 01:22:19.060]   with the iPad.
[01:22:19.060 --> 01:22:21.300]   Had a lot of fans.
[01:22:21.300 --> 01:22:22.300]   Yeah.
[01:22:22.300 --> 01:22:24.060]   Let's see.
[01:22:24.060 --> 01:22:31.700]   Tim Cook email regarding the incident in Australia, a manager at an Apple store.
[01:22:31.700 --> 01:22:39.940]   Throughout some Somali students, students, they were in school uniforms, but they said,
[01:22:39.940 --> 01:22:44.380]   "We're afraid you're going to steal from our store."
[01:22:44.380 --> 01:22:46.780]   So they discriminated against them.
[01:22:46.780 --> 01:22:51.300]   Tim Cook said it's not how we choose to do business.
[01:22:51.300 --> 01:22:54.420]   And he said this is a learning moment.
[01:22:54.420 --> 01:22:55.420]   He called it unacceptable.
[01:22:55.420 --> 01:22:58.180]   What people have seen and heard from watching the video on the web does not represent our
[01:22:58.180 --> 01:23:03.180]   Apple's values.
[01:23:03.180 --> 01:23:08.340]   None of us are happy with the way this was handled.
[01:23:08.340 --> 01:23:14.940]   Store leadership teams around the world starting in Australia will be refreshing their training
[01:23:14.940 --> 01:23:19.220]   on inclusion and customer engagement.
[01:23:19.220 --> 01:23:20.780]   Yeah.
[01:23:20.780 --> 01:23:25.380]   The employee has not returned to the store according to several sources.
[01:23:25.380 --> 01:23:33.180]   I think if we had have seen any instances of this type of behavior in other countries
[01:23:33.180 --> 01:23:39.300]   at other Apple stores, then we could reasonably assume that there's a problem.
[01:23:39.300 --> 01:23:45.260]   But the fact that it happened at one store with a couple of employees or one employee's
[01:23:45.260 --> 01:23:46.260]   security guard.
[01:23:46.260 --> 01:23:47.260]   Yeah.
[01:23:47.260 --> 01:23:48.420]   It's an isolated incident.
[01:23:48.420 --> 01:23:51.620]   I think it's pretty safe to say that this is an isolated incident.
[01:23:51.620 --> 01:23:59.220]   I mean, we've all followed Apple for many years.
[01:23:59.220 --> 01:24:05.740]   We all report on Tim and understand I think what he's about.
[01:24:05.740 --> 01:24:09.060]   And we can say what we want about Apple products.
[01:24:09.060 --> 01:24:16.180]   But I think when it comes to Tim as a person and the leader of the company, I don't believe
[01:24:16.180 --> 01:24:19.300]   that he would condone behavior like this.
[01:24:19.300 --> 01:24:21.140]   No.
[01:24:21.140 --> 01:24:22.140]   No, he does not.
[01:24:22.140 --> 01:24:23.140]   You know.
[01:24:23.140 --> 01:24:26.620]   But it is something in a large institution that you have to do over and over.
[01:24:26.620 --> 01:24:29.980]   Like you have to do this training and repeat it over and over again because you can't do
[01:24:29.980 --> 01:24:31.860]   it once and assume that it'll just stick.
[01:24:31.860 --> 01:24:32.860]   Yeah.
[01:24:32.860 --> 01:24:34.020]   It's good that they're doing that.
[01:24:34.020 --> 01:24:37.900]   One of the senior managers at the store in Melbourne greeted the same group a couple of
[01:24:37.900 --> 01:24:38.900]   days later.
[01:24:38.900 --> 01:24:43.900]   If students expressed a heartfelt apology on behalf of the store and of Apple and reassured
[01:24:43.900 --> 01:24:47.620]   them that they and their classmates would always be welcome at the store.
[01:24:47.620 --> 01:24:51.860]   This school's principal later told a reporter she delivered her message with good grace.
[01:24:51.860 --> 01:24:56.300]   And one of the students says it feels like we have justice now.
[01:24:56.300 --> 01:24:59.260]   Yeah.
[01:24:59.260 --> 01:25:04.860]   And Tim pointed out the high point store is quite diverse.
[01:25:04.860 --> 01:25:08.740]   People work in the store not only from Australia but Egypt, Italy, India and five other nations,
[01:25:08.740 --> 01:25:12.580]   15 languages including Urdu, Portuguese, Arabic and Mandarin.
[01:25:12.580 --> 01:25:18.140]   So I think it's always been clear in its hiring policies, Apple is quite diverse.
[01:25:18.140 --> 01:25:22.540]   A lot of people look like Jim Dalrymple for one thing.
[01:25:22.540 --> 01:25:26.620]   He's like a ministore.
[01:25:26.620 --> 01:25:31.540]   But you know, I have to, I do have to point out that one of our regular contributors,
[01:25:31.540 --> 01:25:38.780]   O and J.J. Stone, O, Dokta did experience what he considers a incidence of discrimination
[01:25:38.780 --> 01:25:44.380]   in an Apple store and has told that story on Twitter a couple of times.
[01:25:44.380 --> 01:25:47.660]   So I don't know, I think it probably is an isolated incident.
[01:25:47.660 --> 01:25:53.380]   I know Tim Cook would not want it to happen and is doing everything to keep it from happening.
[01:25:53.380 --> 01:25:59.700]   It's such a nice offshoot of the relationship that Apple has with its customers.
[01:25:59.700 --> 01:26:05.380]   You feel as though you know this institution well enough to think about what they would
[01:26:05.380 --> 01:26:07.340]   and would not do.
[01:26:07.340 --> 01:26:12.260]   And I think most companies are very concerned about issues like this, but you feel as though
[01:26:12.260 --> 01:26:18.180]   the senior management of Apple would be, we've got to slap this down immediately and unequivocally.
[01:26:18.180 --> 01:26:25.260]   When you see a video like that, you don't think that the headline of a larger problem
[01:26:25.260 --> 01:26:30.220]   amongst all Apple stores, it's something that is really going to upset people at the front
[01:26:30.220 --> 01:26:31.220]   office.
[01:26:31.220 --> 01:26:39.260]   Let's take a break, come back with more, some celebration in our neighbor to the north.
[01:26:39.260 --> 01:26:46.900]   And we'll join the party in the moments north of the 49th parallel there.
[01:26:46.900 --> 01:26:50.700]   Happy eating poutine and drinking molesons.
[01:26:50.700 --> 01:26:52.500]   Our episode today brought to you by my mattress.
[01:26:52.500 --> 01:26:56.020]   Oh, I had a good night's sleep last night.
[01:26:56.020 --> 01:26:57.020]   You know what we're learning?
[01:26:57.020 --> 01:26:59.460]   It's really interesting is how important sleep is.
[01:26:59.460 --> 01:27:03.900]   Not just, you know, so you're not tired in the morning, but to your overall health, a
[01:27:03.900 --> 01:27:06.660]   good night's sleep is imperative.
[01:27:06.660 --> 01:27:11.740]   And I think we're all trying to do more to improve our sleep one way, improve the thing
[01:27:11.740 --> 01:27:16.140]   you sleep on, get a Casper mattress, Casper.
[01:27:16.140 --> 01:27:22.060]   An awesome, great mattress is an amazing price premium mattresses made in the US, but because
[01:27:22.060 --> 01:27:25.700]   they sell directly to you, there's no middleman.
[01:27:25.700 --> 01:27:28.420]   That means they eliminate that massive markup that the mattress.
[01:27:28.420 --> 01:27:32.660]   And you know it's a massive markup because the mattress stores have big 200% off sales.
[01:27:32.660 --> 01:27:37.460]   Whenever you see that, you know, oh, I think there's a little room for margin in there.
[01:27:37.460 --> 01:27:42.300]   I think they're making money even when they take 200% off, not a Casper.
[01:27:42.300 --> 01:27:46.500]   Casper, you're pairing a fair price for a great mattress and they offer free delivery.
[01:27:46.500 --> 01:27:49.100]   You see it comes in a very compact box.
[01:27:49.100 --> 01:27:50.180]   That's a queen size mattress.
[01:27:50.180 --> 01:27:53.140]   I'm opening on the video for those of you watching our video.
[01:27:53.140 --> 01:27:55.580]   This is our Casper right here.
[01:27:55.580 --> 01:28:01.020]   And it comes in a tiny, not tiny, but relatively small, easily maneuvered box, which is great
[01:28:01.020 --> 01:28:06.180]   for moving when my son needed a new mattress on his third floor walk up last year.
[01:28:06.180 --> 01:28:10.940]   We got him a Casper and he was easily able to get it up the three flights, get it into
[01:28:10.940 --> 01:28:14.500]   the room, open up the box and how he loves his mattress.
[01:28:14.500 --> 01:28:17.100]   By the way, you may say, well, I got to sleep on it.
[01:28:17.100 --> 01:28:18.300]   How am I going to know I like it?
[01:28:18.300 --> 01:28:19.500]   You can.
[01:28:19.500 --> 01:28:25.100]   You have painless returns within a 100 day period, 100 days, I should say 100 nights to
[01:28:25.100 --> 01:28:26.940]   sleep on your Casper.
[01:28:26.940 --> 01:28:31.500]   If at any time in those 100 nights, you say, yeah, I want my old mattress back.
[01:28:31.500 --> 01:28:33.140]   Take the old mattress, put it back on the bed.
[01:28:33.140 --> 01:28:34.300]   Casper will send it courier.
[01:28:34.300 --> 01:28:35.300]   They'll come.
[01:28:35.300 --> 01:28:38.940]   They'll get the mattress and they'll refund you every penny you paid.
[01:28:38.940 --> 01:28:42.300]   No fee shipping or returns.
[01:28:42.300 --> 01:28:47.660]   Get a Casper mattress, $500 for a twin, $950 for the biggest size they make, the king's
[01:28:47.660 --> 01:28:48.980]   size.
[01:28:48.980 --> 01:28:51.340]   And you can save an additional 50 bucks just because you're listening.
[01:28:51.340 --> 01:28:59.180]   If you go to the website, Casper, C-A-S-P-E-R, Casper.com/MacBreak, and do use a promo
[01:28:59.180 --> 01:29:08.060]   code MacBreak, that way you'll get your $50 off an amazing mattress, Casper.com/MacBreak.
[01:29:08.060 --> 01:29:09.460]   Maybe it's not time for you to get a new mattress.
[01:29:09.460 --> 01:29:12.020]   Make a note of that though for future.
[01:29:12.020 --> 01:29:15.060]   Although I think a new mattress, you know, whether they say every 10 years, you should
[01:29:15.060 --> 01:29:17.420]   replace your mattress.
[01:29:17.420 --> 01:29:22.820]   I'm kidding, depending on how much it's used, in some cases more often.
[01:29:22.820 --> 01:29:26.780]   Casper.com/MacBreak, use the offer code MacBreak.
[01:29:26.780 --> 01:29:32.780]   And in Canada, you can pay with Apple Pay, finally.
[01:29:32.780 --> 01:29:33.780]   Finally.
[01:29:33.780 --> 01:29:34.780]   Finally.
[01:29:34.780 --> 01:29:38.580]   Renee, is there jubilation in the streets of beautiful Montreal?
[01:29:38.580 --> 01:29:42.420]   Well, I mean, it's interesting because it's coming by way of American Express.
[01:29:42.420 --> 01:29:46.700]   They're obviously, yeah, I'm sorry, Renee.
[01:29:46.700 --> 01:29:48.380]   They jumped right on the Apple Pay bandwagon.
[01:29:48.380 --> 01:29:51.180]   I remember I had a lot of credit cards that wouldn't work out of the box with Apple Pay,
[01:29:51.180 --> 01:29:53.340]   but American Express did.
[01:29:53.340 --> 01:29:54.740]   Like Apple, they're an integrated provider.
[01:29:54.740 --> 01:29:55.740]   They are their own banks.
[01:29:55.740 --> 01:29:59.100]   So it's not like you have to do with Visa and MasterCard, where every bank issues the cars,
[01:29:59.100 --> 01:30:00.940]   you got to go bank by bank.
[01:30:00.940 --> 01:30:03.980]   Granted, that's not as onerous in Canada because we have nationally charted banks and there
[01:30:03.980 --> 01:30:07.780]   aren't that many of them, but it's sort of a good thing and a bad thing because they're
[01:30:07.780 --> 01:30:09.860]   also much more powerful because they're a national bank.
[01:30:09.860 --> 01:30:11.260]   So they didn't want to move.
[01:30:11.260 --> 01:30:12.980]   So American Express did.
[01:30:12.980 --> 01:30:16.580]   And the really cool thing is American Express looked at the technology and they said with
[01:30:16.580 --> 01:30:20.300]   Touch ID and with the PIN code, this is as secure as PIN and chip.
[01:30:20.300 --> 01:30:25.660]   So we're not going to put that arbitrary $100 limit on contactless payment.
[01:30:25.660 --> 01:30:29.100]   So as soon as you're authorized, as soon as you've loaded it in, you can just use it
[01:30:29.100 --> 01:30:33.420]   any place that American Express is accepted, which includes like McDonald's and SO, which
[01:30:33.420 --> 01:30:38.700]   is our version of Exxon and a whole bunch of other places.
[01:30:38.700 --> 01:30:41.780]   And you have all this time not been able to use your Apple Watch for Apple Pay.
[01:30:41.780 --> 01:30:43.460]   You had to come here to use it.
[01:30:43.460 --> 01:30:46.540]   Yeah, it was ironic because I have a corporate card for mobile nations.
[01:30:46.540 --> 01:30:48.580]   But it's an American corporate card and I loaded it up.
[01:30:48.580 --> 01:30:52.140]   But places that take the transactions won't take American American Express.
[01:30:52.140 --> 01:30:55.380]   So it was always one thing or another.
[01:30:55.380 --> 01:30:56.540]   And now I just applied.
[01:30:56.540 --> 01:31:00.620]   I was hoping I used TD and Royal Bank and some of the other ones and they just they wouldn't
[01:31:00.620 --> 01:31:01.620]   get on it.
[01:31:01.620 --> 01:31:06.420]   And I think it's a little bit embarrassing and shows some lack of forward thinking.
[01:31:06.420 --> 01:31:08.820]   And I'm happy American Express is doing it.
[01:31:08.820 --> 01:31:10.780]   It's available in the UK.
[01:31:10.780 --> 01:31:11.780]   Yes.
[01:31:11.780 --> 01:31:13.500]   And the US now Canada.
[01:31:13.500 --> 01:31:19.060]   Australia gets it on Thursday and American Express has said Hong Kong, Singapore and Spain are
[01:31:19.060 --> 01:31:20.060]   coming next.
[01:31:20.060 --> 01:31:21.780]   Okay, that's good.
[01:31:21.780 --> 01:31:23.220]   It is a more secure way to pay.
[01:31:23.220 --> 01:31:25.660]   I think in every respect it's better for everybody.
[01:31:25.660 --> 01:31:27.940]   I don't understand why a bank would be reluctant.
[01:31:27.940 --> 01:31:31.180]   And it's anonymous because they don't get my information.
[01:31:31.180 --> 01:31:35.580]   So in order to like if I give them the transaction, the clerk doesn't know it like the vendor
[01:31:35.580 --> 01:31:38.820]   knows it because they know what I'm buying and Visa has information.
[01:31:38.820 --> 01:31:42.180]   But the clerk doesn't know the person handling transaction doesn't know they don't get my
[01:31:42.180 --> 01:31:43.180]   card.
[01:31:43.180 --> 01:31:46.340]   It doesn't have your information.
[01:31:46.340 --> 01:31:48.580]   They don't store my credit card number, which is great.
[01:31:48.580 --> 01:31:51.580]   And they like it because a credit card number is a good single identifier to do customer
[01:31:51.580 --> 01:31:52.660]   profiling.
[01:31:52.660 --> 01:31:55.020]   But it means that they now you can do loyalty cards.
[01:31:55.020 --> 01:31:58.700]   You can do reward cards and Apple Pay, but you have to offer them as a separate thing.
[01:31:58.700 --> 01:32:02.340]   And that means that to get my data, you have to give me something of value like points
[01:32:02.340 --> 01:32:03.340]   or discounts.
[01:32:03.340 --> 01:32:04.500]   And then it's a fair trade again.
[01:32:04.500 --> 01:32:08.700]   And I like that much more than you just harvesting my data for this because I choose to stop
[01:32:08.700 --> 01:32:10.860]   the shop at your establishment.
[01:32:10.860 --> 01:32:12.460]   Apple's not stopping there.
[01:32:12.460 --> 01:32:20.540]   They're interested in adding peer-to-peer payments in Apple's messages.
[01:32:20.540 --> 01:32:22.500]   So there are a number of apps that do this.
[01:32:22.500 --> 01:32:24.220]   Venmo is available in the United States.
[01:32:24.220 --> 01:32:27.140]   And PACE says very popular in Africa.
[01:32:27.140 --> 01:32:33.060]   In fact, in areas where banking isn't widely available, text message payments are very
[01:32:33.060 --> 01:32:34.060]   popular.
[01:32:34.060 --> 01:32:36.740]   And PACE is huge.
[01:32:36.740 --> 01:32:39.900]   So according to the Wall Street Journal, Apple's been talking with US banks, including
[01:32:39.900 --> 01:32:45.220]   JP Morgan Chase, US bank, Corp Wells Fargo and Citi, there's some debate as you would
[01:32:45.220 --> 01:32:46.220]   expect.
[01:32:46.220 --> 01:32:48.820]   This is from an article in Quartz.
[01:32:48.820 --> 01:32:54.580]   Some debate as you might expect about how to do the technical issues and who gets paid
[01:32:54.580 --> 01:32:55.580]   what?
[01:32:55.580 --> 01:32:59.260]   Apple apparently, according to Quartz, is willing not to make money off of peer-to-peer
[01:32:59.260 --> 01:33:01.260]   payments.
[01:33:01.260 --> 01:33:02.900]   They don't need to make money off of it.
[01:33:02.900 --> 01:33:06.140]   This is where Apple has a real advantage.
[01:33:06.140 --> 01:33:09.300]   And I guess the theory is they might implement it in messages.
[01:33:09.300 --> 01:33:13.060]   That's how you do it in text messages for MPAISA.
[01:33:13.060 --> 01:33:15.180]   So there was a job posting.
[01:33:15.180 --> 01:33:20.300]   There was a job posting according to Quartz for Apple Pay from November 2014 for a senior
[01:33:20.300 --> 01:33:28.700]   architect who had expertise in the money transfer space.
[01:33:28.700 --> 01:33:29.700]   There are smart companies.
[01:33:29.700 --> 01:33:32.060]   Anything that we can think of that would be good for them to do, they've thought about
[01:33:32.060 --> 01:33:34.060]   doing it and looked into it.
[01:33:34.060 --> 01:33:35.060]   I'm sure.
[01:33:35.060 --> 01:33:40.300]   I think Facebook's been looking at something like that with Messenger.
[01:33:40.300 --> 01:33:42.180]   It makes sense in messaging apps.
[01:33:42.180 --> 01:33:47.100]   And of course, it makes the messaging app more powerful, more important.
[01:33:47.100 --> 01:33:53.100]   Have you tried speaking of that, the Notify app that Facebook released?
[01:33:53.100 --> 01:33:55.420]   It's available in iOS, yes?
[01:33:55.420 --> 01:33:57.340]   Yep.
[01:33:57.340 --> 01:33:59.780]   I still limit my Facebook footprint later.
[01:33:59.780 --> 01:34:01.020]   I mean, I look at it up.
[01:34:01.020 --> 01:34:06.100]   It says on screen for 5% background for like 900 minutes.
[01:34:06.100 --> 01:34:13.180]   And I launched it on the iPad Pro and it's got a keyboard from 1937 on it.
[01:34:13.180 --> 01:34:18.540]   All right.
[01:34:18.540 --> 01:34:20.660]   Apple's App Store has a better search engine.
[01:34:20.660 --> 01:34:23.540]   According to TechCrunch, have you noticed the difference?
[01:34:23.540 --> 01:34:26.340]   Never was a very good search engine.
[01:34:26.340 --> 01:34:27.340]   Never.
[01:34:27.340 --> 01:34:28.340]   Never.
[01:34:28.340 --> 01:34:30.980]   It's one of those things that are like Apple does several things in parallel.
[01:34:30.980 --> 01:34:32.860]   Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's bad.
[01:34:32.860 --> 01:34:35.700]   The new news service, you have the news app where you have your news, but then you have
[01:34:35.700 --> 01:34:39.260]   the Siri news, then you have the shared links and Safari, but then you also have reading
[01:34:39.260 --> 01:34:43.300]   lists and there's no sort of sanitized version of this.
[01:34:43.300 --> 01:34:45.300]   This was broadly similar.
[01:34:45.300 --> 01:34:47.900]   There was no one good way of doing it.
[01:34:47.900 --> 01:34:51.180]   I don't know.
[01:34:51.180 --> 01:34:56.420]   It's one of those things that they just have to work their way through.
[01:34:56.420 --> 01:35:00.940]   Like app search versus spotlight search, one would do nearest neighbor, one wouldn't, one
[01:35:00.940 --> 01:35:06.940]   cared about spelling, one didn't care about spelling, one would do search widening automatically
[01:35:06.940 --> 01:35:07.940]   and one wouldn't.
[01:35:07.940 --> 01:35:11.460]   And you sort of, you don't know why you're not getting the same results because all you
[01:35:11.460 --> 01:35:13.620]   see is a search box.
[01:35:13.620 --> 01:35:19.180]   I saw your article about the App Store.
[01:35:19.180 --> 01:35:21.020]   Maybe some people were bit by this.
[01:35:21.020 --> 01:35:24.740]   A message that your app is damaged, deleted and reinstalled.
[01:35:24.740 --> 01:35:27.700]   This was due to a bad security certificate.
[01:35:27.700 --> 01:35:28.940]   Can you explain what happened?
[01:35:28.940 --> 01:35:33.820]   Yeah, so there were two different problems and that's what sort of made it confusing
[01:35:33.820 --> 01:35:38.340]   is that one Apple's original App Store, Mac App Store certificate expired and that was
[01:35:38.340 --> 01:35:40.780]   a Shaw one certificate and they replaced it.
[01:35:40.780 --> 01:35:42.620]   Some people thought they forgot to replace it.
[01:35:42.620 --> 01:35:43.620]   They didn't.
[01:35:43.620 --> 01:35:47.900]   They replaced it a while ago with a Shaw two certificate, but there was a bug in the caching
[01:35:47.900 --> 01:35:49.580]   system that didn't get the new certificate.
[01:35:49.580 --> 01:35:51.020]   It kept the old one around.
[01:35:51.020 --> 01:35:55.940]   When the old one expired, apps just refused to run and they would say that they were damaged
[01:35:55.940 --> 01:36:01.100]   and you had to either log back into the Mac App Store or delete the app and redownload
[01:36:01.100 --> 01:36:04.180]   it in order for it to see the new certificate and run again.
[01:36:04.180 --> 01:36:09.780]   At the same time, some developers to do receipt validation were using a very, very old version
[01:36:09.780 --> 01:36:11.620]   of OpenSSL prior to 2005.
[01:36:11.620 --> 01:36:15.420]   It gave you some sense of the context and that couldn't handle Shaw two.
[01:36:15.420 --> 01:36:18.500]   So it would just fail and the app would not be able to successfully run.
[01:36:18.500 --> 01:36:22.740]   So in getting a bunch of developers to update OpenSSL to support Shaw two, we're going to
[01:36:22.740 --> 01:36:23.740]   take a long time.
[01:36:23.740 --> 01:36:26.580]   So Apple rolled the certificate back to Shaw one.
[01:36:26.580 --> 01:36:30.780]   So I mean, hopefully not forever, but that at least got all the apps running again.
[01:36:30.780 --> 01:36:38.100]   We should be clear that while that shot one has not been cracked, but as the computers
[01:36:38.100 --> 01:36:43.060]   get faster, the prospect of it being crackable gets more and more real.
[01:36:43.060 --> 01:36:49.420]   And as a result, Google, Microsoft and others have started to deprecate Shaw one certificates.
[01:36:49.420 --> 01:36:54.620]   So there's a push to upgrade to Shaw two.
[01:36:54.620 --> 01:36:56.580]   All right.
[01:36:56.580 --> 01:37:00.420]   So the biggest problem was for people who had apps that they didn't want to upgrade to
[01:37:00.420 --> 01:37:04.380]   the new version and the old version was no longer available and then they had to search
[01:37:04.380 --> 01:37:06.340]   their purchased history and get it again.
[01:37:06.340 --> 01:37:09.060]   And in some cases, they had code that still couldn't be updated.
[01:37:09.060 --> 01:37:12.540]   So there were a few people who were a bit by this, but it overall has been fixed.
[01:37:12.540 --> 01:37:13.540]   OK.
[01:37:13.540 --> 01:37:14.540]   Let's see.
[01:37:14.540 --> 01:37:15.540]   What else?
[01:37:15.540 --> 01:37:19.340]   I know you've got to get out of here, Jim.
[01:37:19.340 --> 01:37:25.740]   So I'm trying to wrap this puppy up here.
[01:37:25.740 --> 01:37:26.740]   Any other big stories?
[01:37:26.740 --> 01:37:29.060]   We don't want to miss gentlemen.
[01:37:29.060 --> 01:37:30.900]   Apple TV videos just came out.
[01:37:30.900 --> 01:37:31.900]   Videos.
[01:37:31.900 --> 01:37:32.900]   What do you mean?
[01:37:32.900 --> 01:37:33.900]   YouTube.com/apple.
[01:37:33.900 --> 01:37:34.900]   They've got five Apple TV spots.
[01:37:34.900 --> 01:37:35.900]   Oh.
[01:37:35.900 --> 01:37:39.740]   Very short, but it's nice to see that they're doing it.
[01:37:39.740 --> 01:37:42.540]   YouTube.com/apple.
[01:37:42.540 --> 01:37:43.780]   There's HBO.
[01:37:43.780 --> 01:37:44.780]   Just a slash Apple.
[01:37:44.780 --> 01:37:45.780]   There's an HBO.
[01:37:45.780 --> 01:37:46.780]   There's Netflix.
[01:37:46.780 --> 01:37:50.340]   There is a.
[01:37:50.340 --> 01:37:51.580]   Crossy roads.
[01:37:51.580 --> 01:37:52.580]   Yeah.
[01:37:52.580 --> 01:37:53.580]   Happy duty.
[01:37:53.580 --> 01:37:54.580]   That's good for.
[01:37:54.580 --> 01:37:55.580]   Oh, yeah.
[01:37:55.580 --> 01:37:59.180]   You know what I love that it starts off with the color bars.
[01:37:59.180 --> 01:38:02.540]   So you make it looks like that looks like one of the keynotes, right?
[01:38:02.540 --> 01:38:04.300]   I'm surprised there's no Chinese.
[01:38:04.300 --> 01:38:06.300]   Just Apple TV.
[01:38:06.300 --> 01:38:07.300]   Apple TV.
[01:38:07.300 --> 01:38:08.300]   Sure.
[01:38:08.300 --> 01:38:10.300]   Oh, ha.
[01:38:10.300 --> 01:38:12.940]   The love crossy road on the Apple TV.
[01:38:12.940 --> 01:38:13.940]   Oh.
[01:38:13.940 --> 01:38:14.940]   Oh.
[01:38:14.940 --> 01:38:17.940]   You're gonna be your best.
[01:38:17.940 --> 01:38:18.940]   Oh.
[01:38:18.940 --> 01:38:21.340]   Oh, this is pretty straightforward, right?
[01:38:21.340 --> 01:38:22.740]   It's an easy ad.
[01:38:22.740 --> 01:38:26.020]   It's good to see because Apple TV was ignored for like it was a hobby for a long time and
[01:38:26.020 --> 01:38:29.660]   they didn't do TV spots and they didn't do a lot of marketing behind it.
[01:38:29.660 --> 01:38:30.660]   Yeah.
[01:38:30.660 --> 01:38:31.660]   So these are 15 second-day.
[01:38:31.660 --> 01:38:32.660]   The game of the one's is good too.
[01:38:32.660 --> 01:38:33.660]   Yeah, it's a very short.
[01:38:33.660 --> 01:38:36.660]   There's Ask Bobby.
[01:38:36.660 --> 01:38:38.820]   What you want to play it?
[01:38:38.820 --> 01:38:39.820]   Yeah.
[01:38:39.820 --> 01:38:41.300]   That's all you need to do, really.
[01:38:41.300 --> 01:38:44.060]   Speaks for itself.
[01:38:44.060 --> 01:38:45.420]   It's interesting though.
[01:38:45.420 --> 01:38:46.420]   They're pushing.
[01:38:46.420 --> 01:38:47.420]   Oh, one, Leo.
[01:38:47.420 --> 01:38:48.420]   Huh?
[01:38:48.420 --> 01:38:49.420]   How the HBO one.
[01:38:49.420 --> 01:38:51.500]   Okay, let me see if I can get back there.
[01:38:51.500 --> 01:38:56.100]   Disney infinity HBO now on Apple TV.
[01:38:56.100 --> 01:38:59.100]   Ha ha ha ha.
[01:38:59.100 --> 01:39:00.100]   Yeah.
[01:39:00.100 --> 01:39:03.940]   It features dragon and Kaleesi.
[01:39:03.940 --> 01:39:04.940]   Mother of the.
[01:39:04.940 --> 01:39:09.540]   Yeah, that's not a spoiler at this point because that was last.
[01:39:09.540 --> 01:39:12.060]   That was the last season.
[01:39:12.060 --> 01:39:14.020]   You didn't know there were dragons in Game of Thrones.
[01:39:14.020 --> 01:39:15.020]   Yeah, right.
[01:39:15.020 --> 01:39:16.020]   What?
[01:39:16.020 --> 01:39:17.020]   There's dragons?
[01:39:17.020 --> 01:39:18.020]   Whoa.
[01:39:18.020 --> 01:39:19.020]   All right.
[01:39:19.020 --> 01:39:20.020]   Nice.
[01:39:20.020 --> 01:39:23.540]   Oh, now we're still seeing an ad for the iPad Pro.
[01:39:23.540 --> 01:39:26.220]   It's just nice to see the game that they're putting some marketing behind the Apple TV.
[01:39:26.220 --> 01:39:30.660]   I'm embarrassed because I was watching an ad that I was sure was for my pet pro.
[01:39:30.660 --> 01:39:39.820]   It would turn out to be a surface surface.
[01:39:39.820 --> 01:39:41.740]   You got peanut butter in my chocolate.
[01:39:41.740 --> 01:39:43.740]   Let's see.
[01:39:43.740 --> 01:39:44.740]   All right.
[01:39:44.740 --> 01:39:46.220]   Let's let's take a break.
[01:39:46.220 --> 01:39:48.980]   But I'm going to let Jim go because he's got it just a couple of minutes.
[01:39:48.980 --> 01:39:51.620]   And so when we come back, we're going to do our picks of the week, but Jim, I'm going
[01:39:51.620 --> 01:39:54.180]   to let you pick your heavy metal band of the week.
[01:39:54.180 --> 01:39:55.180]   Hurley.
[01:39:55.180 --> 01:39:56.180]   You know what?
[01:39:56.180 --> 01:39:58.380]   I'm going to do something different this of course you are.
[01:39:58.380 --> 01:40:03.300]   It's it's still music, but I am going to recommend Pandora.
[01:40:03.300 --> 01:40:05.980]   And it's interesting that we just talked about it.
[01:40:05.980 --> 01:40:09.820]   But my parents were just here for three weeks.
[01:40:09.820 --> 01:40:18.020]   I tried every service out there to have like a 60s radio, something, you know, music that
[01:40:18.020 --> 01:40:21.540]   we could listen to that they would enjoy.
[01:40:21.540 --> 01:40:25.300]   And I tried everything and nothing came up with.
[01:40:25.300 --> 01:40:29.180]   Well, how many pericomo albums are there on?
[01:40:29.180 --> 01:40:33.180]   Well, no, I'm taught in 60s, 60s hit 60s.
[01:40:33.180 --> 01:40:34.180]   That's good.
[01:40:34.180 --> 01:40:37.340]   You know, my people and stuff like that.
[01:40:37.340 --> 01:40:42.300]   So Pandora killed it three weeks of listening to the station.
[01:40:42.300 --> 01:40:45.620]   Now I've been a subscriber to Pandora for for quite a while.
[01:40:45.620 --> 01:40:51.460]   So I also have Aussie station slash Megadeth, Metallica stations.
[01:40:51.460 --> 01:40:54.940]   And they just kill it every single time.
[01:40:54.940 --> 01:40:57.020]   So go get Pandora.
[01:40:57.020 --> 01:41:03.980]   Yeah, I've been a subscriber to Pandora longer than any other music service.
[01:41:03.980 --> 01:41:07.700]   But you know, I have to say the radios gotten better on a lot of these other ones.
[01:41:07.700 --> 01:41:08.700]   Still not.
[01:41:08.700 --> 01:41:09.700]   It's good.
[01:41:09.700 --> 01:41:12.820]   Doesn't even compare to what Pandora does.
[01:41:12.820 --> 01:41:13.820]   Yeah.
[01:41:13.820 --> 01:41:14.820]   Love it.
[01:41:14.820 --> 01:41:17.100]   You know what I use Pandora for?
[01:41:17.100 --> 01:41:20.980]   I don't want to buy Christmas music because then it's in my iTunes.
[01:41:20.980 --> 01:41:24.180]   So I deleted all my Christmas music.
[01:41:24.180 --> 01:41:27.100]   And I have I have so many Christmas stations.
[01:41:27.100 --> 01:41:28.580]   I have let's see.
[01:41:28.580 --> 01:41:30.860]   Okay, pay no attention to the fact that I have Enya radio.
[01:41:30.860 --> 01:41:33.260]   Don't know that's that's that's somebody else put that in there.
[01:41:33.260 --> 01:41:35.220]   Peter Gabriel radio or John Legend.
[01:41:35.220 --> 01:41:36.420]   Pay no attention to that.
[01:41:36.420 --> 01:41:42.500]   US Christmas radio, Christmas blues radio, Christmas decoration radio, Christmas choral
[01:41:42.500 --> 01:41:45.900]   classics, gospel Christmas radio.
[01:41:45.900 --> 01:41:46.900]   Good Lord.
[01:41:46.900 --> 01:41:48.580]   I have a lot of Christmas stations.
[01:41:48.580 --> 01:41:50.780]   Holy cow.
[01:41:50.780 --> 01:41:55.980]   You really can tell something about people when you look at their Pandora list stations,
[01:41:55.980 --> 01:42:00.580]   you know, quite a few Christmas stations, but they do a nice job.
[01:42:00.580 --> 01:42:06.140]   And that way you don't have to buy this crap.
[01:42:06.140 --> 01:42:07.260]   You can listen for December.
[01:42:07.260 --> 01:42:10.220]   I think I even have like a Charlie Brown Christmas station.
[01:42:10.220 --> 01:42:13.860]   It's a lot of in square reality.
[01:42:13.860 --> 01:42:14.860]   Thank you, James.

[01:42:32.180 --> 01:42:33.180]   It's not true.
[01:42:33.180 --> 01:42:34.180]   It's not true.
[01:42:34.180 --> 01:42:36.180]   Well, it's not false either.
[01:42:36.180 --> 01:42:40.820]   Keep saying it eventually the name of flip after you.
[01:42:40.820 --> 01:42:42.740]   All right.
[01:42:42.740 --> 01:42:43.740]   Thank you, Jim.
[01:42:43.740 --> 01:42:44.740]   Take care.
[01:42:44.740 --> 01:42:45.740]   Are you sure they?
[01:42:45.740 --> 01:42:46.740]   Bye guys.

[01:42:56.460 --> 01:42:57.460]   Yeah.
[01:42:57.460 --> 01:43:01.700]   Once we once we told him that we'd send him a case of Heineken every time he came on,
[01:43:01.700 --> 01:43:03.500]   it was it was a no brainer.
[01:43:03.500 --> 01:43:05.580]   I could say that now.

[01:45:16.060 --> 01:45:18.140]   And we've got it for you.
[01:45:18.140 --> 01:45:24.620]   You can do 10 days as many courses as you consume in that time, free run of the place.
[01:45:24.620 --> 01:45:25.740]   That's one of the things I like about it.
[01:45:25.740 --> 01:45:28.660]   You don't have to decide ahead of time what you want to watch when you subscribe to Linda.
[01:45:28.660 --> 01:45:29.660]   You get everything.
[01:45:29.660 --> 01:45:30.660]   Look at that.
[01:45:30.660 --> 01:45:34.300]   It's assembling MRI slices into a 3D volume.
[01:45:34.300 --> 01:45:36.460]   That's wild.
[01:45:36.460 --> 01:45:39.700]   Linda.com/macbreak.
[01:45:39.700 --> 01:45:40.700]   Wow.
[01:45:40.700 --> 01:45:45.300]   I didn't know Deak McClellan knew that stuff, but it's a Photoshop technique, so that makes
[01:45:45.300 --> 01:45:46.780]   sense.
[01:45:46.780 --> 01:45:47.940]   Linda.com/macbreak.
[01:45:47.940 --> 01:45:52.780]   Sign up for that free 10 day trial you'll get to see.
[01:45:52.780 --> 01:45:55.540]   It's a really good way to just kind of get a whole sense of what Linda can do.
[01:45:55.540 --> 01:45:57.340]   And then I know you're going to want to subscribe.
[01:45:57.340 --> 01:45:59.460]   By the way, many businesses subscribe for their employees.
[01:45:59.460 --> 01:46:00.460]   We do.
[01:46:00.460 --> 01:46:06.220]   And it's a great way to keep your employees skills up to snuff, up to tip top shape.
[01:46:06.220 --> 01:46:08.900]   So businesses, you should consider that too.
[01:46:08.900 --> 01:46:13.020]   Linda, L-Y-N-D-A.com/macbreak.
[01:46:13.020 --> 01:46:18.580]   Renee, Richie, I bet you have something wonderful to pick.
[01:46:18.580 --> 01:46:22.300]   This is something that, you know, it may not be useful to everybody, but I think it shows
[01:46:22.300 --> 01:46:25.100]   just what you can do with the iPad Pro and it's an app called You Make.
[01:46:25.100 --> 01:46:26.100]   Oh, yeah.
[01:46:26.100 --> 01:46:27.100]   They showed it.
[01:46:27.100 --> 01:46:28.300]   They were in studio because they showed it.
[01:46:28.300 --> 01:46:29.300]   Yeah.
[01:46:29.300 --> 01:46:31.740]   And they've got a terrific, you had them on, I think, right?
[01:46:31.740 --> 01:46:32.740]   Yeah.
[01:46:32.740 --> 01:46:37.940]   And they've got a video that went up, I think, within the last week that just shows sort of
[01:46:37.940 --> 01:46:43.580]   what you make on the iPad can do versus you make it on, or something similar on AutoCAD.
[01:46:43.580 --> 01:46:45.780]   And it's just, it's amazing.
[01:46:45.780 --> 01:46:50.540]   It's basically one guy was on an airplane playing around with you make, creating a car.
[01:46:50.540 --> 01:46:55.140]   The other guy was back at the office working on AutoCAD making a car.
[01:46:55.140 --> 01:46:59.020]   And this guy managed to get the basic design done on the plane trip of a few hours where
[01:46:59.020 --> 01:47:01.780]   the other guy took a couple days in AutoCAD.
[01:47:01.780 --> 01:47:05.860]   And the models, obviously you can do more on AutoCAD, but the models that they produced
[01:47:05.860 --> 01:47:11.740]   were not dissimilar enough that, you know, it just, it changes your, your conceptions
[01:47:11.740 --> 01:47:14.260]   of what's possible on these devices.
[01:47:14.260 --> 01:47:18.220]   And they actually went and built the car out of the models that they were creating.
[01:47:18.220 --> 01:47:23.420]   And it just, it shows you that what one of the things is, it's hard to know what's possible
[01:47:23.420 --> 01:47:28.100]   because you're constrained by all your previous experiences and preconceptions.
[01:47:28.100 --> 01:47:31.220]   And then you give these tools to people who just think differently.
[01:47:31.220 --> 01:47:34.100]   And they make these, these crazy, amazing apps.
[01:47:34.100 --> 01:47:39.020]   And then I'm hoping that this kind of stuff in CODA and what Andy's going to talk about,
[01:47:39.020 --> 01:47:44.340]   we're at the, we're at week one of the iPad Pro and I can't wait to see where we get
[01:47:44.340 --> 01:47:47.180]   to over the next couple of months and the next year.
[01:47:47.180 --> 01:47:52.900]   You make.xyz it's, it is available on regular iPads, but of course it's the iPad Pro that
[01:47:52.900 --> 01:47:53.900]   you want to.
[01:47:53.900 --> 01:47:54.900]   Yeah, it's free.
[01:47:54.900 --> 01:47:59.420]   There's $150 in that purchase, which is nothing for software like this.
[01:47:59.420 --> 01:48:03.340]   And we were, we were trying it out at the demo and basically they put a Coke bottle on and
[01:48:03.340 --> 01:48:07.260]   then you quickly drew the Coke bottles outline on one side, turned it into vector points.
[01:48:07.260 --> 01:48:08.820]   You could edit the vector points.
[01:48:08.820 --> 01:48:11.900]   Then you could basically, you could spin it around to make it a 3D object, pull it up
[01:48:11.900 --> 01:48:16.300]   in three dimensions, start looking at it and it was, it was just amazing.
[01:48:16.300 --> 01:48:20.660]   So you get, try it for free because you'll get a good, good sense of what, what it can
[01:48:20.660 --> 01:48:21.660]   do.
[01:48:21.660 --> 01:48:27.140]   And then if you decide this is for me, $14.99 a month or $150 bucks.
[01:48:27.140 --> 01:48:29.180]   Oh, it's not per month.
[01:48:29.180 --> 01:48:32.140]   It's just, no, no, that's for a year.
[01:48:32.140 --> 01:48:33.140]   Okay.
[01:48:33.140 --> 01:48:34.140]   Yeah.
[01:48:34.140 --> 01:48:36.260]   And I saw something, like it looks a little bit daunting at first because you're working
[01:48:36.260 --> 01:48:39.780]   in three dimensions with different tools and it's a little bit complicated, but I saw someone
[01:48:39.780 --> 01:48:42.700]   who'd been using it for about a day or two days and they were just spinning the whole
[01:48:42.700 --> 01:48:46.180]   world around and moving stuff and it was, it was, it was amazing to see that kind of
[01:48:46.180 --> 01:48:47.180]   direct manipulation.
[01:48:47.180 --> 01:48:48.180]   You know, it's funny.
[01:48:48.180 --> 01:48:52.100]   They've actually made that car that they show, because Dick T. Bartolo on when he was
[01:48:52.100 --> 01:48:53.860]   on the radio show was talking about that car.
[01:48:53.860 --> 01:48:55.500]   He said, yeah, they 3D printed this car.
[01:48:55.500 --> 01:48:58.740]   I didn't realize that was the you make car.
[01:48:58.740 --> 01:49:03.140]   It's actually was at a, it was at a concept show and it's entirely 3D printed.
[01:49:03.140 --> 01:49:05.860]   It's incredible, incredible.
[01:49:05.860 --> 01:49:09.380]   You make free to try.
[01:49:09.380 --> 01:49:12.780]   And now, ladies and gentlemen, Andy and not coz pick of the week.
[01:49:12.780 --> 01:49:16.780]   Well, just to, just to aid in the education of the, of the youths.
[01:49:16.780 --> 01:49:20.700]   So this is my Star Wars trilogy, the definitive collection on the way to the house could be
[01:49:20.700 --> 01:49:22.020]   in a box that big.
[01:49:22.020 --> 01:49:26.020]   Well, see, that's, that's, that was one of the problems of laser disc.
[01:49:26.020 --> 01:49:32.540]   This is, there's a nice book about the making of about, it only contains the original trilogy.
[01:49:32.540 --> 01:49:35.820]   And the problem with laser, well, there are a lot of problems with laser disc, but so
[01:49:35.820 --> 01:49:43.660]   this is for the entire, just this original Star Wars, the new hope.
[01:49:43.660 --> 01:49:47.300]   It requires three discs, three double side.
[01:49:47.300 --> 01:49:50.760]   Double side, because you have to stop and turn it over unless you have a fancy laser
[01:49:50.760 --> 01:49:52.500]   disc player that will do the flippant for you.
[01:49:52.500 --> 01:49:53.500]   Yeah.
[01:49:53.500 --> 01:49:56.380]   And so it's like a huge, like, off the disc, like this.
[01:49:56.380 --> 01:50:00.520]   It looks like, but the cool, but here's why, here's why we love this, because number
[01:50:00.520 --> 01:50:03.280]   one, there can be no copy protection on laser discs.
[01:50:03.280 --> 01:50:04.280]   Right.
[01:50:04.280 --> 01:50:05.740]   So feel free to make VHS tapes.
[01:50:05.740 --> 01:50:12.480]   And also every single frame of the film is recorded discreetly on this disc.
[01:50:12.480 --> 01:50:17.580]   So if you want to like single, single frame your way through it, it's like photograph,
[01:50:17.580 --> 01:50:20.440]   photograph, photograph, photograph, photograph, photograph.
[01:50:20.440 --> 01:50:25.300]   And the days when you're a VHS, and even if you had a really expensive player, you can't
[01:50:25.300 --> 01:50:32.520]   really tell what the, what the, if you really wanted to find out, I really think that Han
[01:50:32.520 --> 01:50:38.020]   had a different blaster at the middle of the movie than he did at the end of the movie.
[01:50:38.020 --> 01:50:40.180]   You can actually place this, you can actually find out that.
[01:50:40.180 --> 01:50:44.500]   You see, there are one, two, three, four, five vents on the front, mouse, or grip, and
[01:50:44.500 --> 01:50:46.700]   there were only six on the other one.
[01:50:46.700 --> 01:50:51.540]   So actually I think the laser copy was used as part of that fan recreation of episode
[01:50:51.540 --> 01:50:52.540]   four.
[01:50:52.540 --> 01:50:53.540]   Not be surprised to see.
[01:50:53.540 --> 01:50:58.940]   I keep them intact because this is the only, it is pristine.
[01:50:58.940 --> 01:51:05.120]   It has not been, it was restored, quote unquote, to make the print prettier.
[01:51:05.120 --> 01:51:07.820]   But it's essentially an analog.
[01:51:07.820 --> 01:51:11.620]   In fact, the audio is uncompressed analog audio.
[01:51:11.620 --> 01:51:14.320]   So best audio, better than a DVD.
[01:51:14.320 --> 01:51:19.660]   Yeah, short of it ever being remastered onto Blu-ray, this might be the best copy of a
[01:51:19.660 --> 01:51:24.060]   new hope that you will ever get, assuming that you are a nerd like me and you're saying.
[01:51:24.060 --> 01:51:27.220]   I used to have, when I lived in the city, we were with a couple of blocks from a laser
[01:51:27.220 --> 01:51:28.220]   disk store.
[01:51:28.220 --> 01:51:29.220]   Yeah.
[01:51:29.220 --> 01:51:33.860]   And I would go in there and yeah, even then, there were a whole lot of them, but it was
[01:51:33.860 --> 01:51:34.860]   fun.
[01:51:34.860 --> 01:51:35.860]   There were a lot of imports.
[01:51:35.860 --> 01:51:37.900]   There were audio, there were audio file ones.
[01:51:37.900 --> 01:51:42.660]   The one that really hooked me was the director's edition of the Abyss James Cameron, because
[01:51:42.660 --> 01:51:47.840]   it's not only the actual disc, but because James Cameron was coming off of success after
[01:51:47.840 --> 01:51:54.240]   success for the laser disc edition of the Abyss, a minor James Cameron movie, he actually
[01:51:54.240 --> 01:51:59.200]   convinced 20th Century Fox to let him reshoot the ending because they ran out of budget
[01:51:59.200 --> 01:52:01.160]   to shoot like the original ending.
[01:52:01.160 --> 01:52:05.280]   So for the laser disc, they actually finished all the digital effects of the original editing.
[01:52:05.280 --> 01:52:10.040]   And plus there are hours and hours of video in which they interview this, the most horrendous
[01:52:10.040 --> 01:52:14.360]   movie shoot in history, they got all the cast back to talk about what a horrible experience
[01:52:14.360 --> 01:52:18.120]   it was, how proud they were, but they were never, anyway, it was an audio file format.
[01:52:18.120 --> 01:52:22.840]   So once again, the next time you're complaining about, well, jeez, it's so hard to get movies
[01:52:22.840 --> 01:52:23.840]   onto my phone.
[01:52:23.840 --> 01:52:24.840]   Yeah.
[01:52:24.840 --> 01:52:26.340]   Try to get this on your phone.
[01:52:26.340 --> 01:52:29.640]   You get no sympathy from us old people.
[01:52:29.640 --> 01:52:33.000]   But as far as pick of the week goes, we already talked about procreate.
[01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:34.560]   I just want to enhance that.
[01:52:34.560 --> 01:52:35.880]   I underscore that again.
[01:52:35.880 --> 01:52:38.840]   Everything we said early in the show still goes, but I wanted to just.
[01:52:38.840 --> 01:52:43.680]   Is that the drawing program of choice better than 53's paper better than I?
[01:52:43.680 --> 01:52:45.200]   Well, I like it more.
[01:52:45.200 --> 01:52:51.240]   53's paper is that they made it into more of a note, of a molesky notebook sort of app.
[01:52:51.240 --> 01:52:52.240]   Now you can add text.
[01:52:52.240 --> 01:52:56.120]   You can do outlines and it's got social sharing features.
[01:52:56.120 --> 01:52:59.640]   And so they never, and they also never got rid of the idea of this is simply a sheet of
[01:52:59.640 --> 01:53:01.240]   paper that you can draw stuff on.
[01:53:01.240 --> 01:53:04.440]   And the simplicity is really the advantage of paper.
[01:53:04.440 --> 01:53:09.680]   What I like about procreate is that it kind of builds the best stuff between what Mac paint
[01:53:09.680 --> 01:53:11.480]   was originally, which is just draw.
[01:53:11.480 --> 01:53:12.480]   Don't worry about it.
[01:53:12.480 --> 01:53:13.480]   Just draw.
[01:53:13.480 --> 01:53:19.320]   But nonetheless, having enough advanced features from you might see in Adobe product so that
[01:53:19.320 --> 01:53:23.640]   if you want to make a change, if you want to do things like layers, I would never have
[01:53:23.640 --> 01:53:25.960]   been able to do that that queen portrait.
[01:53:25.960 --> 01:53:30.720]   If I have not the ability to do things in separate layers, so that, okay, the eyes are
[01:53:30.720 --> 01:53:31.720]   perfect.
[01:53:31.720 --> 01:53:32.720]   So that's on a separate layer.
[01:53:32.720 --> 01:53:33.720]   That's a lot.
[01:53:33.720 --> 01:53:34.720]   I'm not sure if I have a lot of things.
[01:53:34.720 --> 01:53:38.480]   It's, if for $5.99, you really got to have it.
[01:53:38.480 --> 01:53:42.720]   The more I use it, the more features that I find I discover with it and the more stuff
[01:53:42.720 --> 01:53:45.280]   becomes easier with it and the more ambitious I get with it.
[01:53:45.280 --> 01:53:50.160]   The reason why I wanted to talk about it again is just to say it is exactly what I hope from
[01:53:50.160 --> 01:53:52.440]   any piece of technology, any piece of software.
[01:53:52.440 --> 01:53:54.440]   I'm not, I'm not here to benchmark things.
[01:53:54.440 --> 01:53:56.680]   I'm not here to say here's how fast this is.
[01:53:56.680 --> 01:53:59.920]   And here's how this task would have taken me 53 minutes and something else took me only
[01:53:59.920 --> 01:54:01.120]   18 in this.
[01:54:01.120 --> 01:54:04.640]   What I really want is that there is something that I've been wanting to do or I've had an
[01:54:04.640 --> 01:54:10.920]   interest in that I was not enabled to explore without the use of this technology.
[01:54:10.920 --> 01:54:14.360]   And just as we discussed with Renee, I never went to art school.
[01:54:14.360 --> 01:54:16.640]   I don't know how to use these, these things.
[01:54:16.640 --> 01:54:19.800]   I don't know what the techniques are, but I can just mess around with it.
[01:54:19.800 --> 01:54:22.480]   It is so much fun to mess around with.
[01:54:22.480 --> 01:54:26.600]   And now it's like I've been posting a drawing a day from Procreate.
[01:54:26.600 --> 01:54:30.120]   They're not really great, but they're fun.
[01:54:30.120 --> 01:54:34.000]   The thing that I posted today is an abstract thing that I just wanted to screw around with.
[01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:39.200]   And as always happened, it's, I just kind of got, I started off with finally figuring
[01:54:39.200 --> 01:54:42.360]   out how to enable the art tools in the Notes app.
[01:54:42.360 --> 01:54:46.880]   It turns out that you have to update all of your notes to, to the new version of the
[01:54:46.880 --> 01:54:47.880]   iOS app.
[01:54:47.880 --> 01:54:50.640]   And that means you can't use any of your notes synced across any other device.
[01:54:50.640 --> 01:54:53.440]   It's not running El Capitan or iOS 9.
[01:54:53.440 --> 01:54:55.480]   But I finally got it going again and just did some doodling.
[01:54:55.480 --> 01:54:58.460]   And then without even really thinking about it, started on something that was kind of
[01:54:58.460 --> 01:55:01.600]   interesting, then moved it into Procreate so I'd have more tools.
[01:55:01.600 --> 01:55:05.040]   And it's not, I guess, not a great piece of art, but I had a great time drawing it for
[01:55:05.040 --> 01:55:06.560]   45 minutes.
[01:55:06.560 --> 01:55:11.680]   And it's something that helps you to develop an interest and puts you, makes you happy
[01:55:11.680 --> 01:55:14.760]   you spent that 45 minutes doing whatever you did.
[01:55:14.760 --> 01:55:15.760]   You did, you did.
[01:55:15.760 --> 01:55:17.680]   Boy, that's not only worth five bucks.
[01:55:17.680 --> 01:55:19.400]   It's also worth the hundred bucks for the pencil one.
[01:55:19.400 --> 01:55:22.400]   It's the worst worth the thousand bucks for the iPad pro.
[01:55:22.400 --> 01:55:25.880]   So I'm very, not only am I happy with it, I'm grateful for apps like that.
[01:55:25.880 --> 01:55:31.140]   So, Renee, is there a, somebody like me, no ability to draw at all?
[01:55:31.140 --> 01:55:36.100]   And I'd like to, you know, now that I'm stuck with this iPad pro, you sit.
[01:55:36.100 --> 01:55:41.140]   Is there a drawing book or program or a course that you'd recommend to get started?
[01:55:41.140 --> 01:55:45.260]   I'm going to, I'm going to, Renee's going to have a better recommendation, but I'm going
[01:55:45.260 --> 01:55:50.940]   to send you a link to a column that Roger Ebert wrote about how he became a, someone
[01:55:50.940 --> 01:55:55.900]   who sketches every single day after hearing a lecture from somebody 20 years earlier,
[01:55:55.900 --> 01:55:59.300]   who simply said that everybody can draw and just get into it.
[01:55:59.300 --> 01:56:00.300]   You just have to do it.
[01:56:00.300 --> 01:56:01.300]   You just have to do it.
[01:56:01.300 --> 01:56:02.300]   And that will get you motivated.
[01:56:02.300 --> 01:56:04.700]   That will break down any of your inhibitions about doing it.
[01:56:04.700 --> 01:56:08.300]   I will send you that link because it's, I must read something like drawing from the right
[01:56:08.300 --> 01:56:10.260]   side of the brain or something like that.
[01:56:10.260 --> 01:56:13.020]   You could do all those like, when I was a kid, I had had to draw comics, the Marvel
[01:56:13.020 --> 01:56:17.280]   way and it taught me about geometry and construction and all like really good solid basics and
[01:56:17.280 --> 01:56:18.280]   plus superheroes.
[01:56:18.280 --> 01:56:19.280]   Great.
[01:56:19.280 --> 01:56:20.740]   But it really, like Andy said, it's just you draw.
[01:56:20.740 --> 01:56:25.660]   And if you, if you're nervous to start trace, you, you start to at least develop the skills
[01:56:25.660 --> 01:56:27.940]   and Linda might have some great courses too.
[01:56:27.940 --> 01:56:28.940]   I never even heard of it.
[01:56:28.940 --> 01:56:29.940]   I haven't checked.
[01:56:29.940 --> 01:56:30.940]   Yeah.
[01:56:30.940 --> 01:56:31.940]   Yeah.
[01:56:31.940 --> 01:56:32.940]   They could.
[01:56:32.940 --> 01:56:33.940]   But the thing about procreate, that's so great for me.
[01:56:33.940 --> 01:56:36.320]   We, on the debug podcast is going to be out on Wednesday.
[01:56:36.320 --> 01:56:40.900]   We sat down and spoke to James Kuda, who's the, the CEO of Savage Interactive who makes
[01:56:40.900 --> 01:56:44.020]   procreate for about it in two hours or so.
[01:56:44.020 --> 01:56:48.700]   And he, he explained they, they built so much good stuff, like all the different, like
[01:56:48.700 --> 01:56:53.860]   you can customize that brush and the pencil and everything in there to an incredible extent
[01:56:53.860 --> 01:56:59.940]   and they did great things with the rejection and with the predictive, it's just, they,
[01:56:59.940 --> 01:57:02.460]   they care so much about that product and it really shows.
[01:57:02.460 --> 01:57:06.540]   Boy, and you want to see something that demonstrates the speed of this thing.
[01:57:06.540 --> 01:57:10.780]   If you do a Gaussian blur, it's in real time.
[01:57:10.780 --> 01:57:11.780]   Yeah.
[01:57:11.780 --> 01:57:13.580]   That's pretty impressive.
[01:57:13.580 --> 01:57:14.980]   It's magical.
[01:57:14.980 --> 01:57:19.300]   It really, it feels like, I remember the first time I picked up an Apple mouse in my hand
[01:57:19.300 --> 01:57:24.740]   and use a Mac for the first time and how I've seen things animated on a desktop computer
[01:57:24.740 --> 01:57:30.460]   screen before, but I'd never seen a mouse pointer that was just absolutely weasel like
[01:57:30.460 --> 01:57:32.260]   speed responsive.
[01:57:32.260 --> 01:57:35.140]   There is no, you are not interacting with an app.
[01:57:35.140 --> 01:57:37.620]   You are drawing on this pixel display.
[01:57:37.620 --> 01:57:38.620]   Yes.
[01:57:38.620 --> 01:57:39.620]   That's how that's this thing is.
[01:57:39.620 --> 01:57:43.780]   And with pencil, it's, so it's all of this hardware and software and operating system and
[01:57:43.780 --> 01:57:46.860]   APIs working together to produce the best experience possible.
[01:57:46.860 --> 01:57:49.300]   And it is 100% successful at that.
[01:57:49.300 --> 01:57:52.380]   Well, I get my pencil in two weeks.
[01:57:52.380 --> 01:57:53.380]   Little more.
[01:57:53.380 --> 01:57:54.380]   Almost.
[01:57:54.380 --> 01:57:56.740]   Yeah, you do, you do have two weeks to take that iPad Pro back and.
[01:57:56.740 --> 01:57:57.740]   Yeah.
[01:57:57.740 --> 01:57:58.740]   Check the stores.
[01:57:58.740 --> 01:57:59.740]   Just check the stores today, Leo.
[01:57:59.740 --> 01:58:00.740]   You might be surprised.
[01:58:00.740 --> 01:58:01.740]   It has only surprised.
[01:58:01.740 --> 01:58:05.340]   It's like popping a store and say, Hey, hey, hey, how durable are those pencils?
[01:58:05.340 --> 01:58:08.500]   I've seen some concern that maybe they're not that durable.
[01:58:08.500 --> 01:58:10.420]   I did it's, it's glossy.
[01:58:10.420 --> 01:58:15.300]   And so taking out of the box, I dropped it right on my kitchen floor and it still worked.
[01:58:15.300 --> 01:58:16.300]   Okay.
[01:58:16.300 --> 01:58:17.300]   Okay.
[01:58:17.300 --> 01:58:18.300]   I mean, take care of it.
[01:58:18.300 --> 01:58:19.300]   It's an instrument.
[01:58:19.300 --> 01:58:20.300]   Yeah.
[01:58:20.300 --> 01:58:21.300]   My mom's an artist.
[01:58:21.300 --> 01:58:23.300]   I'm, I think, and she loves her iPad already, but I think this is for her.
[01:58:23.300 --> 01:58:25.780]   This is, we're getting my mom for the holidays.
[01:58:25.780 --> 01:58:28.380]   It's going to be your Christmas present.
[01:58:28.380 --> 01:58:29.380]   Yeah.
[01:58:29.380 --> 01:58:32.420]   And expensive one of this.
[01:58:32.420 --> 01:58:34.580]   I love your mom.
[01:58:34.580 --> 01:58:35.580]   And he and I life.
[01:58:35.580 --> 01:58:36.580]   Yeah.
[01:58:36.580 --> 01:58:40.980]   So Chicago, Chicago, sometimes he is our guy, Andy Andy.
[01:58:40.980 --> 01:58:42.540]   He's the guy.
[01:58:42.540 --> 01:58:43.540]   And here's the link.
[01:58:43.540 --> 01:58:49.460]   Somebody posted it in the chatroom to the Roger Ebert column, which I will have to read.
[01:58:49.460 --> 01:58:50.740]   You can draw and draw it.
[01:58:50.740 --> 01:58:52.340]   Probably better than I can.
[01:58:52.340 --> 01:58:53.340]   Yeah.
[01:58:53.340 --> 01:58:54.340]   I had that.
[01:58:54.340 --> 01:58:55.340]   I had it.
[01:58:55.340 --> 01:58:56.340]   It was funny.
[01:58:56.340 --> 01:59:00.220]   I handed, he had his first experience with an iPad with my iPad because I saw him about
[01:59:00.220 --> 01:59:02.100]   a week and a half after it was released.
[01:59:02.100 --> 01:59:05.660]   And the first thing he did was draw my portrait with it because he was just an inverte, an
[01:59:05.660 --> 01:59:06.660]   embedded sketcher.
[01:59:06.660 --> 01:59:07.660]   Neat.
[01:59:07.660 --> 01:59:09.140]   So this would be a good place to start.
[01:59:09.140 --> 01:59:10.140]   Yeah.
[01:59:10.140 --> 01:59:11.140]   At Roger Ebert.
[01:59:11.140 --> 01:59:12.700]   Good launch pad for inspiration.
[01:59:12.700 --> 01:59:15.300]   Just don't get inside your own head.
[01:59:15.300 --> 01:59:16.300]   Yeah.
[01:59:16.300 --> 01:59:20.660]   I think the one piece of advice that he took away was that just finish every single sketch
[01:59:20.660 --> 01:59:21.660]   you start.
[01:59:21.660 --> 01:59:22.660]   Ah.
[01:59:22.660 --> 01:59:23.660]   Okay.
[01:59:23.660 --> 01:59:27.020]   Does matter if it's just a stick figure, but don't just draw the head.
[01:59:27.020 --> 01:59:29.580]   You have to draw the body and the arms and everything you intended to draw, you have to
[01:59:29.580 --> 01:59:30.580]   draw.
[01:59:30.580 --> 01:59:33.220]   Renee Richie is at imore.com.
[01:59:33.220 --> 01:59:40.060]   Boy, if you get a new iPad or a new anything from Apple, you definitely want to run, not
[01:59:40.060 --> 01:59:45.140]   walk to imore.com, download the how-to articles they do, the reviews, the news.
[01:59:45.140 --> 01:59:46.340]   It's a great site.
[01:59:46.340 --> 01:59:47.340]   Thank you.
[01:59:47.340 --> 01:59:49.820]   You must, you must visit imore.com.
[01:59:49.820 --> 01:59:52.500]   And then while you're there, check out the podcast, the debug podcast.
[01:59:52.500 --> 01:59:54.700]   I have a great many podcasts now.
[01:59:54.700 --> 01:59:57.260]   And they're always fascinating, especially for Apple fans.
[01:59:57.260 --> 02:00:00.940]   There's just really a great wealth of stuff there.
[02:00:00.940 --> 02:00:04.540]   How to use Apple Pay, a guide for your Canadians.
[02:00:04.540 --> 02:00:05.540]   Yeah.
[02:00:05.540 --> 02:00:11.900]   I mean, people laugh, but like one of the things about it is that if you just see even a wizard
[02:00:11.900 --> 02:00:15.060]   on a computer, it's intimidating for people who don't know what's going to happen next
[02:00:15.060 --> 02:00:17.180]   or what if I choose this option or that option.
[02:00:17.180 --> 02:00:19.420]   So if you just walk them through it, it eliminates a lot of stress.
[02:00:19.420 --> 02:00:20.380]   Yeah, I know I'm with you.
[02:00:20.380 --> 02:00:26.820]   I think that when I get my mom that iPad Pro, I'll get her a subscription to imore.com.
[02:00:26.820 --> 02:00:29.060]   Comes in the mail every week, right?
[02:00:29.060 --> 02:00:31.380]   Glossy, right?
[02:00:31.380 --> 02:00:32.380]   Thank you, Renee.
[02:00:32.380 --> 02:00:33.380]   Thank you, Andy.
[02:00:33.380 --> 02:00:34.380]   I'm Leo LaPorte.

[02:00:56.500 --> 02:00:57.500]   showing on the screen.
[02:00:57.500 --> 02:01:00.500]   But if you can watch a video, there's stuff to see too.

[02:01:07.860 --> 02:01:09.860]   All there is is going to halo.
[02:01:09.860 --> 02:01:10.860]   Saint Enochco.
[02:01:10.860 --> 02:01:12.540]   All you have to do.
[02:01:12.540 --> 02:01:13.540]   Thank you for acknowledging that.
[02:01:13.540 --> 02:01:15.820]   I didn't want to say that myself.
[02:01:15.820 --> 02:01:18.980]   Saint Andy, he's the patron saint of laser discs.
[02:01:18.980 --> 02:01:23.740]   All you have to do is go to twit.tv/mbw for Macbreak Weekly or wherever.
