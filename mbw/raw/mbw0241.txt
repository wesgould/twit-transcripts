[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.600]   In fact, I don't know if it's even safe to say that anymore.
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.360]   Apple's all over the place.
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.160]   Cupertino, where's that?
[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.120]   That's where the mothership landed,
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.600]   with the bearing the alien Steve Jobs some 40 years ago.
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.800]   And look what's happened ever since.
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.600]   Joining us right now from Ted Bits,
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.520]   the great Adam Anks has been covering this.
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.600]   - Out of the old. - Story, hello Adam.
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.000]   (laughing)
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.840]   He's been covering it since the mothership landed.
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.680]   (imitating motor)
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:40.640]   - Got a good enough camera.
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.560]   - How long did you celebrate your 20th anniversary, didn't you?
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.400]   - For Ted Bits.
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.400]   - 20 first will be coming up in a week or so.
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.440]   - Wow, that's amazing, that's amazing.
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.280]   - You're gonna be able to drink and drive, final.
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.440]   - Yay.
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.880]   - That's a long time to do anything.
[00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.520]   Vote, serving the star and forces, all sorts of things.
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.560]   - Let alone a weekly newsletter.
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.800]   - Yeah, yeah. - The best.
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.640]   - But as I was saying, it's just amazing.
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.240]   Back, you look back 10 years or so,
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.880]   and Apple would do about as much in a year
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.960]   as they do sometimes in one announcement now.
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:09.800]   - Yeah.
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.680]   - It's just nonstop these days.
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.200]   - Well, there's a big story about Skype five.
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.320]   We're gonna talk about it in just a second,
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.600]   but first let's welcome Andy Inaco,
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.160]   who is in his trophy room.
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.120]   I think that's pretty exciting.
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.800]   How many people realize?
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.760]   - Yes, I was known as quite the gridiron
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.520]   snapdragon great back in the day.
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.040]   Now I just use this office to inspire the youth
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.560]   of my community to dream big, go big, and be big.
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.720]   - I think we have actually the University of Colorado
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.240]   to thank for the football.
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.040]   - Football, if people didn't believe that,
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.400]   I'd say well, you can buy a lot of good trophies
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.680]   on eBay and manufacture your own.
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.160]   Yes, I'm speaking at the Commerce on World Affairs,
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.960]   the University of Colorado, the Athletic Department,
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.680]   was nice enough to offer me use of a corner of their office
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.000]   and their awesome gigabit ethernet.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.400]   So it's gonna work better than the Wi-Fi hotspot
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.000]   that was going to be my fallback position.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.080]   (laughing)
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.920]   - Goodness.
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.400]   - I'm guessing goodness.
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.320]   - We're at altitude and 3G requires oxygen
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.680]   just as much as anything else does.
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.080]   So that would have been fun.
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.280]   So once again, my grateful, grateful thanks
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.320]   to the fine folks here at the Athletic Department.
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.640]   - Yes, indeed.
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.360]   Actually, one of the things we were gonna talk about,
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.960]   you started a little bit Adam,
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.920]   is that it is a little bit, I should warn people,
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.920]   a little bit of a slow week in Apple News this week.
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.680]   I don't know if we're in between announcements.
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.440]   I guess we are, WWDC is in June.
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.840]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.000]   I mean, and honestly, if they didn't slow down a little bit,
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.720]   I think those of us in the media would just fall apart.
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.400]   I mean, it's otherwise it's nonstop for a while.
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.560]   - Some exhaustion, yeah.
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:40.400]   - Yeah, really.
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.600]   (laughing)
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.560]   - So the stories we're gonna cover today
[00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.520]   are actually kind of the silly season stories
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.520]   you usually hear in newspapers in August.
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.000]   April is a silly season for Apple fans.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.160]   - Where you'll be hearing all about
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.520]   the water skiing squirrel today on Macquarie Weekly.
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:59.880]   - Exactly.
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.160]   Actually, you know, it is funny
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.440]   because I'm looking at Macworld Magazine desperately,
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.800]   desperately trying to find a story.
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.240]   And the top story right now at Macworld.com,
[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.200]   light painting with a MacBook Pro
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.040]   and the cadaver of a executed murderer.
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.280]   So that's something we all wanna do with our Macs.
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.360]   And--
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.760]   - I think there's gonna be an iLife app for that coming up.
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.120]   So.
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.640]   - Yeah, iLife, the cadaver project.
[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.880]   Wow.
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.080]   Anyway, so that's, I guess they're having the same issue.
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.240]   Another issue, and actually you cover this week in tidbits.
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.080]   This is one of your top stories.
[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.080]   Skye, you even asked us when you said we wanna Skype you.
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.800]   You said Skype five?
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.160]   Or Skye 2.8?
[00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.160]   And I said it's 2.8 the latest.
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.640]   I guess it is, Adam.
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.520]   - It's, yeah, it was, 2.8 was out for a long time, actually.
[00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.960]   And then that, you know what, I don't know,
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.560]   month ago or so, Skype came out with Skype five.
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.200]   And it was one of those things where a few of us
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.680]   on the tidbits staff upgraded
[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.760]   and sort of there were these cries of horror
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.080]   and trying to figure out, you know,
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.880]   how to use the program and just
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.400]   massive numbers of features that had disappeared.
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.160]   Like for instance, indication of who was talking
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.240]   in a conference call, which, you know,
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.000]   they brought back in Skype 5.1.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.400]   But even still, the interface to Skype five is just,
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.160]   it's just nasty.
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.240]   And it's gonna go from a multiple window interface
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.720]   to a single window interface
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.440]   and trying to have all sorts of interface elements
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:33.280]   do double duty.
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.000]   So sidebars, sometimes things inside bars are lists.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   Sometimes they're buttons, who knows?
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.120]   - It's pretty horrible.
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.120]   It's not the best user interface I've ever seen.
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.280]   I have to say that.
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.520]   - Yeah, and it's one of those deep, rich
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.840]   and fulfilling awful user interfaces.
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.960]   Because we're not just talking about one bad idea.
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.680]   We're talking about the idea of,
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.400]   you get to the section of the project
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.040]   planning whiteboard or that meaning where they say,
[00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.000]   "Now we're gonna have a button
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.800]   where people wanna start a video call.
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.160]   This is a picture of a camera."
[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.400]   Yeah, but there must be a way
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.160]   that we can screw up that button.
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.000]   I know, let's make sure it kind of almost looks
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.080]   like a camera, but really doesn't.
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.920]   - It's, I can't even, I'm trying,
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.560]   look, I took a bullet for you guys.
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:14.400]   I took a hit for you guys.
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:15.720]   I installed it on this computer
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.720]   and I don't even know what I'm,
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.240]   I can't even figure out what I'm looking at.
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.840]   - You have to get a call to actually get the video
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.680]   button to show up.
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.700]   And it only shows up when you mouse over the main pane.
[00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:32.200]   So there's a whole lot of contextual controls.
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.600]   So that you can't see them if you're just sitting there
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.200]   looking at it or you're using a different program.
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.240]   - Look at this, okay, I am in Skype.
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.880]   I go to the window menu, I say,
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.400]   "Give me the Skype window."
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.400]   And Skype goes away.
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:48.480]   I don't understand what's going on.
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.240]   This is very confusing.
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.480]   Let's see the dial pad.
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.760]   Oh, it's floating, okay, that's nice.
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:54.880]   In fact, that's one issue,
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:57.120]   which is if you wanna monitor your contacts,
[00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.160]   they float, not only they float over Skype,
[00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.240]   they float over everything.
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:05.240]   They live on top of your UI, which is crazy.
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:06.440]   And this doesn't seem to,
[00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:08.440]   now it seems like they should go in the sidebar here,
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:10.000]   but they don't.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.040]   What goes in the sidebar is just random crap,
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.200]   as far as I can tell.
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.560]   (laughing)
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.120]   This is very confusing.
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:17.440]   - I'll show 'em cover.
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.840]   - How do you do the cover flow of contacts?
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:21.680]   - So, yeah, it's over.
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.040]   - Oh, here it is, yeah.
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:25.760]   Oh, you see, this is what you really want.
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:26.600]   This is--
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:27.880]   And how do you even go through it?
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.040]   I can't, the arrow doesn't, oh, there.
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.440]   Oh, look at that.
[00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:33.280]   There we go.
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:34.120]   - It's just--
[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:37.040]   - That's how I wanna view my contacts.
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:41.800]   This is like, user interface graffiti.
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.600]   Wait a minute, what does this button do?
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.440]   Oh, it pops up the window you can never get rid of.
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:49.240]   Holy come, holy.
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.000]   By the way, how do you make a call?
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:51.840]   I don't know.
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:52.680]   Oh, here.
[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:53.680]   Is this the button you were talking about?
[00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:54.880]   This video button?
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:55.920]   - Well, it's sorta like that.
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:56.760]   It's a different--
[00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:57.960]   - Oh, sorry, John, I'm calling you.
[00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:58.960]   I don't wanna call 'em.
[00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.840]   - And that was the button in the upper right there.
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:03.280]   - Yeah, oh, and then it moves.
[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:04.920]   Oh, cool, rhyme and nately.
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:09.080]   Let's call the Echo123 lady, the Skype lady.
[00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:09.920]   Have they changed her?
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:10.960]   Please don't change her.
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:12.800]   She's my only girlfriend.
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:13.640]   All right.
[00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:15.640]   - Here, let's try calling her.
[00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:18.400]   Hello, so now the button is there, okay.
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:19.240]   - Yep, that's good.
[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:20.080]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:20.920]   - Hello, welcome to the--
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:21.760]   - She should have a picture.
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:22.600]   - She should have a picture.
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:23.440]   - I'd like to know what she looks.
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:24.600]   What is this button?
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:25.960]   This is a confusing button.
[00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:26.960]   It looks like--
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:31.960]   It looks like an alien race somehow has invaded my Skype.
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:34.520]   Oh, add people, so I can add people to the conversation.
[00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:35.520]   Okay.
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:39.240]   - I think those might be e-world refugees.
[00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:40.360]   - They look like it, don't they?
[00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:41.360]   - A race somehow.
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.280]   - Oh, now I'm talking to myself.
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.760]   Let's see, what do these buttons do?
[00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:47.480]   Oh, that's nice, look at that, okay.
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:49.640]   - That one gives you a chat,
[00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.080]   which is very actually quite useful,
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.600]   but a little bit hard to find.
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.440]   - Oh, okay.
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:54.280]   - Then you have to--
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:55.680]   - If you said someone in your L.
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:57.000]   - Lady.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.520]   What are you doing?
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:00.960]   - Something is wrong with your audio recording settings.
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:02.960]   - After the call.
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:04.120]   - He's from my side and my side.
[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:05.120]   - Let's see if she talks back.
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:06.040]   I wish I could see her.
[00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:06.880]   - I will help.
[00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:07.880]   Thank you for using the Skype.
[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:10.520]   - They should put a bot under that.
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:11.360]   - They really should.
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:12.440]   - They should be a lyser.
[00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:13.360]   (laughing)
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:14.360]   - They should.
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:16.800]   Not talking to you, I could tell you that right now.
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.880]   - How do you feel when I gray out your camera button,
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:20.600]   even though your camera's working properly?
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:22.160]   (laughing)
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:23.520]   - Yeah, so when that was another thing
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.240]   that happened to you, Andy, this morning,
[00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:27.160]   in fact, it's happened to everybody we've used
[00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:28.840]   with the new Skype happen during Twi--
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:31.840]   Denise Howell, if you've got any other application
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:35.320]   that could even conceivably wanna use the camera,
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:37.440]   it's gonna complain.
[00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:39.000]   - Yeah, and it's frustrating because--
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.400]   And I don't even mean this as a joke.
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:43.600]   Your hobbled as a diagnostician
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:46.720]   when you try to expect Skype to do things that make sense,
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:48.520]   because one of the first things I did was think,
[00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:50.720]   okay, well, is the camera being used by another application?
[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:51.560]   - Right.
[00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:52.840]   - Well, 'cause the LED is not on.
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:54.360]   Well, let's just go to other applications,
[00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.800]   see, let's launch FaceTime, yep, that can find the camera.
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:57.640]   Great, quit that one.
[00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:59.960]   Let's go to QuickTime, yes, that can find the camera,
[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:02.120]   quit that one, and it wasn't until I decided,
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:04.120]   well, what the heck, I'm gonna quit the iMovie,
[00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:05.880]   even though it really shouldn't be the cause of the problem,
[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:08.560]   and Skype said, "Hey, look, you got a camera."
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:09.400]   - Interesting.
[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:11.560]   - Yeah, 'cause iMovie can't access the camera,
[00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:13.320]   but it isn't accessing it by default.
[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.520]   - Exactly, if the Mr. Green line is not on,
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:17.680]   the camera is available to other applications.
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.880]   I should really tell Skype that.
[00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:22.480]   - Yeah, that's kinda weird, kinda weird.
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.160]   I'm not angry with you, Skype.
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:26.160]   I guess I'm just disappointed.
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.360]   Perhaps it's too much responsibility in your hands
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:31.280]   before you were ready for it.
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:32.320]   I blame myself.
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:33.880]   - Yeah, it's our fault.
[00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:38.120]   So the question then is, how the hell did this happen?
[00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:41.600]   We've seen this before, Mac users can be a little finicky.
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:46.160]   I was joking 'cause I was in the office,
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.240]   we were talking about Adam using the earlier version
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:50.560]   of 2.8 and I said, "Oh, I better use this word perfect
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.160]   3.5 as well."
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:54.320]   - Oh, it's the best, wasn't it?
[00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.800]   - You think I'm still using NiceSwriter?
[00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:58.560]   Come on, not NiceSwriter Classic.
[00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:00.680]   I gave up on Classic long ago.
[00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:04.320]   At least, January.
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:07.240]   - Actually, if word perfect 3.5 still worked,
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:08.120]   I would use it.
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:09.480]   It was the only good word process.
[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:11.560]   - It was right now, that's the one that people want to.
[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:13.160]   - Right now.
[00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:15.720]   So it's where people are notoriously prickly
[00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:16.840]   about these kinds of things.
[00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:18.600]   - Yeah, well, we did the April Fool's,
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.760]   it was actually the follow on April Fool's joke
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:23.840]   of word 5.1 coming back to the iPad.
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:25.040]   (laughing)
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:27.280]   In 2003, we'd done the April Fool's joke
[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:29.840]   of word 5.1 coming to Mac OS X.
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:33.120]   And so this was the continuation of the joke.
[00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:36.920]   Man, people still want word 5.1 A pretty badly.
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:41.960]   - Well, I guess we've bitched enough about Skype.
[00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:43.600]   I guess, do you think,
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:45.800]   has Skype ever backed down and changed?
[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:47.520]   I think they have changed the UI back.
[00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:49.560]   I think they have done that.
[00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:51.760]   - They have admitted in a blog post
[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:55.840]   that they are aware there are concerns about the interface
[00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.280]   and they promise that they're working to update them
[00:11:58.280 --> 00:11:59.520]   in the near future.
[00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:01.440]   That's about all that they have said.
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:04.880]   They're also having this contest to do a new interface
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:08.000]   for the chat interface.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.680]   I mean, if you have a bunch of chats,
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:11.520]   you know, how you have smiley as going back and forth
[00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:13.200]   and I have a TARS and stuff.
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:15.280]   But that's only a very small part of the complaint.
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:17.000]   So Mac, actually I have no complaints at all about that.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.680]   I don't do that.
[00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:20.480]   The problem is just everything else.
[00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:21.320]   - Right.
[00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:23.080]   - Well, it really is terrible.
[00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:24.920]   And then I played with it for a little bit.
[00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:28.560]   It's just unusable and it takes over your screen.
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:30.720]   This is, you can only get it so small.
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:31.880]   - Yeah, yes.
[00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:33.600]   - Not intuitive.
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:34.440]   I've got cover.
[00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:35.920]   - Yeah, that screen, I can't even get it small enough
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:37.320]   to see the buttons at the bottom.
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:39.960]   - Yeah, yeah, my screen is so constrained
[00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:42.280]   because we're showing it on TV that I can't,
[00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:43.960]   I can't get the bottom part.
[00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:44.800]   - I know.
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.520]   - And even if I zoom it,
[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:48.680]   I still, I can kind of, but.
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:50.360]   - Yeah.
[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:52.400]   - And it's not like the changes that Apple made to iMovie
[00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:54.840]   where they made huge sweeping changes
[00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:56.360]   that were so stylistically different
[00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:59.120]   from what came before that it threw everybody up in the street
[00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:00.960]   and had to relearn iMovie all over again.
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:02.960]   But at least you could see that they felt as though
[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:04.880]   they had to bite the bullet and make a sweeping change
[00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:07.200]   that was necessary to move the product forward.
[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:10.040]   With this, I don't see anything other than
[00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:12.720]   some new guy came in, decided that he didn't like the old one,
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:14.960]   he wanted to make the new one and didn't really think it through.
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:18.040]   And about, it's not really a functional piece of software.
[00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:18.880]   - Yeah.
[00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:20.400]   - I just find the fact that I'm, okay,
[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.600]   I'm making it do something functional right now,
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:23.880]   but my point still stands.
[00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:24.720]   I'm still really.
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:25.880]   - Well, and I think we should tell it.
[00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:26.720]   Go ahead Adam.
[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:27.920]   - So there's other things like, you know,
[00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:30.360]   what if you want to have multiple windows open
[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:31.880]   because you're doing multiple chats?
[00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:33.560]   You know, this is, people do that.
[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:35.400]   You know, we're not doing it right now, but,
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:37.480]   and then there's other things like,
[00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:40.480]   the video for MacBrick Weekly doesn't do this,
[00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:43.200]   but if you're doing a multi-person video chat,
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:46.240]   it shows you two avatars up top,
[00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:48.760]   and then others down below in a list,
[00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:52.880]   and whoever is speaking shows up in one of the top two spots
[00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:54.440]   and kind of moves around.
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:57.200]   So the avatars are jumping on you all the time.
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.560]   - Yeah.
[00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:00.640]   - Geez, if only Apple would make it way
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:05.640]   that you could video call other people on a Mac and touch.
[00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:07.080]   Some people are asking quite rightly,
[00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:09.920]   well, why doesn't MacBrick Weekly use FaceTime?
[00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:14.480]   - Well, you know what, you know,
[00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:17.160]   if old man, LaPorte ever came down to the office,
[00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:20.240]   or want to spawn from a golf course, you know?
[00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:23.120]   - I'm too busy preventing my planning to bother with that.
[00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:24.320]   - Too busy counting his money,
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:26.200]   or how he could think of the poor.
[00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:28.000]   - Well, we used, you know, we built this SkyPissaurus,
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.480]   but it was running Windows XP,
[00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:32.200]   so we couldn't, we'd have to design a new SkyPissaurus
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:35.240]   with Mac Minis, we actually toyed with the ideas
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:36.960]   of using Mac Minis, maybe we should have,
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:39.040]   and maybe we will in the next generation.
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:42.480]   And then we could have used FaceTime on these.
[00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:44.640]   The other problem I have with FaceTime is,
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:48.560]   I guess if you do a portrait mode, it fills the screen.
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:49.840]   It's just, it's a, I don't know,
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:52.160]   and I don't know, I guess we could use,
[00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.080]   I see no reason why we couldn't use FaceTime.
[00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:56.680]   - And then Andy could have been coming to us handheld,
[00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:57.680]   walking around Boulder.
[00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:58.680]   - Well, we did do that.
[00:14:58.680 --> 00:14:59.600]   We have done that.
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:02.840]   In fact, Andy, at the last iPad announcement,
[00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:03.920]   or maybe it was a MacBook announcement,
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:08.360]   was giving us a video from the demo room.
[00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:09.920]   - I was doing, yep, exactly.
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:12.240]   I had the suction cup mounted iPhone
[00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:14.280]   that I was shooting another iPhone with,
[00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:17.000]   thus basically turning us into a Kleinwarp
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.400]   that almost killed all reality in time.
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:21.400]   So, but it was worth it because it's got this good footage.
[00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:23.240]   - Well, I guess basically the bottom line is,
[00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:24.720]   if you're using Skype 2.8,
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:27.320]   the last good version of Skype don't upgrade.
[00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:29.880]   You don't have to, there's no reason to upgrade.
[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:32.440]   And you'll be glad, and maybe Skype will be fixed
[00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:34.440]   at some point for Mac users.
[00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:36.840]   Let's take a break when we come back.
[00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:39.240]   I do want to talk about, you mentioned the iPhone, Andy,
[00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:43.600]   and maybe you guys have some sources that'll let us know.
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:45.880]   A, how the Verizon iPhone's doing.
[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:47.680]   B, we're starting to see some reports
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:49.920]   that the Verizon iPhone might actually be better
[00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:51.760]   than the iPhone 4 on AT&T.
[00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:56.760]   And C, with their iPhone 5, all of that.
[00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:58.640]   - Ooh.
[00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:00.520]   - Coming up in just a second, before we do that, though,
[00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:03.480]   I'd like to mention a good company that we've known
[00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:05.240]   for a long time, we've worked with for a long time,
[00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:07.120]   called Carbonite.com.
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:12.120]   They are doing God's work, protecting your data
[00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:16.280]   against the Satan that is date to destruction.
[00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:18.240]   I don't mean to be sacrilegious, I just mean this thing.
[00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:21.800]   You'll pray you had it if you don't,
[00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:23.680]   and the worst happens, 'cause it always does.
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:25.640]   You always, you know what, you're gonna,
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:28.040]   a hard drive's gonna crash, you're gonna lose your laptop.
[00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:31.000]   There's gonna be something bad happening at your home,
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.480]   and you're gonna wish you had backups
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:36.520]   of all that precious stuff on your computer viruses.
[00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:39.800]   Windows or Mac, we don't have to worry so much
[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:43.120]   about viruses, our brethren on the other side
[00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:47.360]   of the aisle do, on the groom's side.
[00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:50.160]   And that's why I recommend Carbonite for PC or Mac.
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:52.080]   It is the best way to back up your data.
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:53.360]   First of all, it's automatic,
[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:54.360]   so you don't have to remember it.
[00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:57.320]   Any good backup solution should just happen
[00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:58.920]   without you're doing anything.
[00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:00.760]   Files are encrypted during transit,
[00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:02.960]   so even, you know, uses your online access.
[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:04.880]   So even if you're at an open access point,
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:07.160]   like where Andy is, or you're at a coffee shop
[00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:10.480]   or at a university, it's 128-bit SSL,
[00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:12.000]   so it's completely safe.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.240]   You can add further encryption
[00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:14.640]   if you want triple-desk or blowfish,
[00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:17.000]   so you're really secure and private.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.240]   That's so easy to do, and the key is
[00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:20.600]   you can get your data anytime,
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:23.520]   even before disaster strikes, it's cloud storage.
[00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:25.240]   So you just log onto your Carbonite account
[00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:28.080]   on Windows, on Mac, on the iPhone app,
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:29.440]   even on Android or BlackBerry,
[00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:32.520]   and there's your data, you can get it anywhere anytime.
[00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:35.800]   And the best part is the price, $55 a year
[00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:37.880]   for all the data on your internal drive.
[00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:39.560]   All the, so if you have a laptop,
[00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:42.920]   the entire laptop drive backed up for $55 a year
[00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:46.280]   and kept back up and restored with just a click of a mouse.

[00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:17.280]   So a study, interesting study, I don't know,
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:18.240]   it's, I guess, a survey.
[00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:20.400]   There's no way you could really study this.
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:25.320]   Of the iPhone 4 says that
[00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:29.560]   fewer calls are dropped
[00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:33.600]   on the Verizon version of the iPhone 4
[00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:35.760]   than on the AT&T version.
[00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:37.840]   This is notoriously difficult to measure.
[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:40.680]   The carriers know, I think the carriers know,
[00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:43.240]   but I don't know how we find out.
[00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:45.800]   - Well, it always depends not on,
[00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:47.720]   the only thing that's important is how,
[00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:49.360]   what kind of experience that you personally have.
[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:50.200]   - Right.
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:51.440]   - And though it would take two or three months
[00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:53.160]   for us to collect, there's enough information to say
[00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:57.600]   that yes, you are more likely to have a faster data speeds
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:59.360]   on this phone instead of this other phone.
[00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:01.240]   Yes, you are more likely to complete your call
[00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:02.480]   on this phone instead of the other,
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:05.560]   but that doesn't matter if you're in a part of the country
[00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:08.200]   or that AT&T or Verizon doesn't support the carbon.
[00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:09.040]   - Well, that's the problem.
[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:09.880]   It's where you are.
[00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:10.720]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:12.800]   - I mean, I've got, this week I'm using
[00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:14.000]   addition to my regular iPhone.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.280]   I've also got the Verizon's really cool Android phone,
[00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:19.720]   the Thunderbolt, the new 4G model.
[00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:21.720]   And Bares, I'm really finding,
[00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:23.560]   released the places where I'm staying.
[00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:25.840]   I'm finding that the AT&T phone M3G
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:28.920]   is way, way, way more reliable than the Verizon 4G,
[00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:30.120]   which is showing me four,
[00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:33.400]   is showing me two bars of connectivity consistently,
[00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:35.920]   but absolutely no connection to the internet.
[00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:38.400]   This is showing me two or three bars of 3G
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:39.360]   that works perfectly fine.
[00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:41.000]   And there's no way to switch it down.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.640]   So in this, just as an example of specifically,
[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:47.040]   I'm glad that you, I'm glad that I'm seeing this chart
[00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:50.160]   that says that I made the right choice by buying Brand X.
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:51.000]   I'm very proud.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.520]   I should put, I should make that chart my lock screen
[00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:56.280]   so that I can observe it while I'm unable to connect calls
[00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:58.040]   on this supposedly superior phone.
[00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:01.200]   This is a survey from a company called ChangeWave.
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:04.720]   I'm looking at the Cult of Mac article about it
[00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:06.240]   and they have this graph.
[00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:11.240]   It does show that while satisfaction levels are identical
[00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:16.240]   between AT&T iPhone users and Verizon iPhone users,
[00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:20.960]   twice as many AT&T owners report dropped calls, 4.8%,
[00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:25.440]   dropped iPhone 4 calls on AT&T versus 1.8% on Verizon.
[00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:26.920]   - But say this is what I think is interesting
[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:30.640]   is that despite the, you know,
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:34.040]   the larger number of dropped calls,
[00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:37.240]   the satisfaction numbers in the chart really are pretty much
[00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:38.080]   identical.
[00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:39.280]   It's a percent here and there.
[00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:42.320]   And so I think the other question is,
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:46.200]   how much do people really care about making the calls?
[00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:48.200]   I mean, there was something AT&T had this thing
[00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:50.440]   where you could get a thousand free minutes
[00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:52.280]   and people were saying, yeah,
[00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:54.360]   but I've got so many rollover minutes anyway.
[00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:55.920]   - I don't need more minutes.
[00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:56.760]   - Yeah.
[00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:59.960]   Everyone's getting Skype now.
[00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:00.800]   (laughing)
[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:01.640]   - No, no, that's not right.
[00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:04.640]   - How good is the iPhone 4?
[00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:12.880]   I mean, the market share seems to be going down
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:13.880]   compared to Android.
[00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:15.440]   People are turning to the Android phone
[00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:16.920]   and the phone's like that Thunderbolt,
[00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:18.640]   you hold in your hand there.
[00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:21.440]   Is the iPhone 4 starting to look a little dated
[00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:23.120]   compared to Android phones?
[00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:24.280]   Or is it advertising?
[00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:26.880]   Why are people buying Android?
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:30.200]   - I think it's just because there are more options available.
[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:33.040]   And I don't think that Android has developed to a point
[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:35.840]   where you can actually call it one phone.
[00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:38.280]   When you buy an iPhone, there really is just one model
[00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:39.760]   that runs all the same software.
[00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:43.080]   With Android, every different model has its own little quirks.
[00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:45.800]   Every little model has its UI enhancements
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:47.520]   and downgrades to it.
[00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:49.840]   And the fact that I have this Thunderbolt
[00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:52.320]   with this really cool, much larger screen
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:54.680]   that works great in some applications,
[00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:58.120]   but in other applications, it's not optimized at all.
[00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:00.800]   I don't think it's any mystery that you can say
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:03.000]   that with all these manufacturers making all these different
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.280]   phones that no matter what kind of specific kind
[00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:07.960]   of Android phone you want, you can find exactly the one you want
[00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:10.040]   at the price you want for the carrier you want.
[00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:12.640]   But I think that really we're talking about one iPhone
[00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:15.600]   versus let's say eight or nine different Android phones.
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:17.160]   - Reminds me a lot of the early days of the Mac
[00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:19.880]   where there was one Mac, one manufacturer,
[00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:23.240]   and dozens of PC manufacturers running Windows.
[00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:24.920]   - Well, the thing that's interesting in this case though
[00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:29.000]   is you look at the App Store and the App Store,
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.480]   Apple's App Store is going gangbusters,
[00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:33.640]   billions of apps purchased and downloaded
[00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:35.800]   and huge sales for at least a small number
[00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:37.440]   of developers, things like that.
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:40.080]   Whereas you look over on the Android side
[00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:42.440]   and the Android marketplace, it's there.
[00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:45.240]   You can get apps there, but there's not nearly as many apps.
[00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:47.080]   - I don't know about that, but there's hundreds of thousands.
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:48.240]   I mean, how many apps do you need?
[00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:50.080]   There's hundreds of thousands.
[00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:54.160]   - But the point is is that if Android is so much more
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:56.080]   of the market, you would expect it
[00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:58.000]   to have a larger application.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.800]   - Well, it's behind it.
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:01.440]   - It's behind the larger one from a business.
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:03.760]   - Apple started in 2007 to collect developers.
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:06.080]   Android really only really started to take off
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:07.040]   a couple of years ago.
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:08.680]   Now, here's a couple of data points.
[00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:10.560]   - Well, let's take a look at the tickle of curves
[00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:11.720]   between the two though.
[00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:15.360]   As soon as Apple released such a comprehensive set
[00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:17.760]   of development tools and such an easy way
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:20.480]   to get to customers, that within two or three months,
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:23.040]   there were I think more significant apps for iOS
[00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:25.560]   than there are available for Android today.
[00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:28.840]   I just don't think that Google has successfully inspired
[00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:32.120]   and motivated developers to go to Android first.
[00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:35.120]   It's gonna happen, but I think that that's a real limitation
[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:36.280]   of Google for some not.
[00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:40.320]   - I mean, 150,000 apps isn't enough.
[00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:42.360]   - I'm saying 150,000 terrible apps
[00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:43.440]   and 12 really good ones.
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:46.400]   - I have to say, almost all the time,
[00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:48.760]   very few situations, Instagram is the only one
[00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:51.440]   that leaps to mind where a company doesn't,
[00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:53.080]   there's ever a note for both sides.
[00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:57.680]   There's, I mean, almost every app you've got on both platforms.
[00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:59.200]   - Those are really good points.
[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:02.000]   When you have a service or an application
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.640]   that's being supported by a huge company
[00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:05.440]   with a much, much larger strategy,
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:08.640]   like Amazon will always make a really good Kindle app
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:09.480]   for every Android size.
[00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:12.360]   - And Cloud Play right now is Android only.
[00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:15.680]   - However, then you check out, for instance, Dropbox,
[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:17.760]   the difference between the version they built for iOS
[00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:20.720]   and the version they built for Android is like night and day.
[00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.120]   And then when you go into something like,
[00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:26.920]   I've got a really cool like dashboard speedometer app
[00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:29.920]   that I use, Acemart HUD, which I still love.
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:30.760]   - Yeah, I love that too.
[00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:33.680]   - I keep looking for something that's similar on Android.
[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:36.040]   And if I can find one with all the features,
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:40.240]   it's really done in sort of an IBM PC XT CGA screen,
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:43.040]   like interface, where it's clearly being designed
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:44.960]   by some guy who knows how to draw a circle
[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:47.560]   in MS Paint, but they don't know how to make something
[00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:50.240]   look really, really good or really functioned very, very well.
[00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:52.560]   So I'm not saying that there aren't great apps for Android.
[00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:54.480]   I'm just saying that they're thinner on the ground
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:56.520]   and you can't really count on finding exactly
[00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:57.600]   the sort of app that you want.
[00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:58.640]   - Well, you do raise one issue,
[00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:01.360]   which is it's very difficult to find apps for Android.
[00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:02.800]   - Yeah. - And that's why Android,
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:05.600]   that's why Amazon is really helping out Google here.
[00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:09.000]   I do, there's a, my my review of the Thunderbolt
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.480]   is sort of taking off to be something bigger
[00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:14.000]   and bigger than just a review of the phone.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.800]   It's actually, I really do think that Android has
[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:19.360]   materially changed as an option.
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:23.120]   Now that Amazon is offering both a solution to the problem
[00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:26.480]   of getting media on the device in a very, very attractive
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:29.640]   and easy way, and they've also solved the App Store problem,
[00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:32.560]   which now this phone is so much more palatable
[00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:33.920]   to so many more people.
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:37.160]   It's an interesting development, I think.
[00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:39.320]   - So a couple of data points here that are kind of interesting,
[00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:43.080]   Major League Baseball reports that,
[00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:45.000]   even though there may be more Android handsets,
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.840]   they actually didn't talk about their sales numbers,
[00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:49.760]   but I presume that they're implying here that they sell
[00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:54.040]   more copies of MLB at that 2011 on Android than iPhone.
[00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:57.840]   They say that the in app purchases are much
[00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:00.960]   or significantly higher on the iPhone side.
[00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:03.320]   And that's, but that's true from the Mac from day one,
[00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:06.640]   is that Apple owners and iPhone owners, I think, too,
[00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:08.120]   spent more money.
[00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:08.960]   (laughing)
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:11.680]   So there's one reason developers may not want to look
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:13.320]   at raw numbers of handsets.
[00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:18.080]   Now, according to the IDC, I love this.
[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:20.320]   Forget it, it's a Windows smartphone, baby.
[00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:22.320]   (laughing)
[00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:23.960]   - It's almost hard to say, it is hard to say that
[00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:25.400]   without laughing.
[00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:29.320]   IDC said that actually the next big thing,
[00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:32.720]   next year, Windows Phone 7.
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:34.040]   - Sorry.
[00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:35.960]   - It's hard not to laugh at that, I know.
[00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:37.560]   (laughing)
[00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:38.400]   - Oh, well.
[00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:39.240]   - Oh, yup.
[00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:40.080]   - We're trying to keep the tray face.
[00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:40.920]   - I do, man.
[00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:43.240]   - I understand where they're coming from on that one.
[00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:44.320]   (laughing)
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:46.680]   - I think it's adorable that some people like to write things
[00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:47.840]   and post them on the internet.
[00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:50.880]   - The best we can figure out is their calculations
[00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:53.160]   where since Nokia sells so many phones
[00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:55.520]   and is apparently embracing Windows Phone 7,
[00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:59.240]   they just took the number of smartphone sales from Nokia
[00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:02.160]   and they just slid them over to the Windows Phone 7 column
[00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:03.720]   for next year and said, "There, it's done,
[00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:04.800]   "they're gonna win."
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:05.640]   - Yeah.
[00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:07.720]   - It's primitive, but effective.
[00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:10.080]   - To be fair, right?
[00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:13.840]   If there's one competitor to, if there's one new upstart,
[00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:15.560]   I do think that Windows Smartphone,
[00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:19.000]   the new Windows operating system has a lot of potential.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.080]   I liked it a lot.
[00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:22.520]   I'm really interested in seeing what happens next year
[00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:24.240]   when they refine it a little bit
[00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:29.240]   because not everybody is really into a mode of using their phone
[00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:30.840]   where they're gonna acquire 100 apps
[00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:32.720]   and spend all their time, you know,
[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:34.360]   work processing on their phone.
[00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:37.760]   As a do-hickey-based add-on system,
[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:39.240]   I think it's a really nice operating system.
[00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:40.920]   It's not here yet, but I don't think,
[00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:43.240]   "I'm glad that I'll be out of contract on this,"
[00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:44.760]   but quite a bit,
[00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:48.280]   "I do Windows Mobile Smartphone 7, Windows 7 Smartphone."
[00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:52.160]   But Andy, I am watching this slowly move over
[00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:54.760]   a little bit more comfortable with Android as you use that.
[00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:55.600]   And you-
[00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:56.440]   - No, no, it's not.
[00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:59.320]   It's not that I've changed.
[00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:01.120]   I really think it's that Android is-
[00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:03.000]   - It's not me.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:03.840]   - No, no, no, I'm big.
[00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:05.680]   All the complaints that I've always had about Android
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:06.520]   are still true.
[00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:09.240]   I still think that the iPhone is,
[00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:12.440]   if someone just asked me for an opinion and says,
[00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:14.200]   you can't explain it,
[00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:16.120]   you don't get to ask me any questions,
[00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:17.560]   you have to recommend one phone.
[00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:20.360]   It's obviously iOS, it's obviously the iPhone.
[00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:23.120]   However, now I can really see a lot of different people
[00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:25.200]   for whom an Android phone is going to be a better choice.
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:26.040]   If you're not,
[00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:30.160]   if for certain values where certain advantages of the iPhone
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:31.720]   are of no importance to you,
[00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:33.720]   then suddenly that opens up a lot of possibilities
[00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:34.560]   with Android.
[00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:38.080]   You have to wonder if Apple does not do a dual core iPhone 5
[00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:40.640]   in June as they would normally be wanted to do,
[00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:43.320]   and we know they're going to put that new A5 chip in it.
[00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:44.760]   If they're not going to start to look like
[00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:47.000]   they're lagging a little bit behind as more and more,
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:47.920]   you know, you don't use to,
[00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:50.360]   that phone you have there anti-assemble processor,
[00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:52.640]   but the, but, droid bionic will be out in a month.
[00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:54.160]   That's dual processor.
[00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:55.880]   There's a number of other dual processor phones,
[00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:58.360]   including the Atrix for AT&T.
[00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:00.480]   That's going to, I think rapidly become the standard
[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:03.200]   for phones, is are they going to feel behind?
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:05.480]   The question is, what does the dual processor do for you?
[00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:06.320]   - Exactly.
[00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:08.600]   - I mean, it never hurts to have more processing power,
[00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:11.400]   but you got to use it for something useful before,
[00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:12.440]   you know, you start to say,
[00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:14.120]   oh wow, we've got to have a dual prock
[00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:15.920]   to be able to compete.
[00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:19.280]   - Jamie, I mean, that's, well, that's my point.
[00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:21.920]   The people are that the developers are more attracted
[00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:25.920]   to iOS as a money-making venture than they are to Android.
[00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:29.120]   And you do see great games make their way to Android,
[00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:31.360]   but they're sending them to iOS first.
[00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:34.040]   So the dual core processors, they're, it's like,
[00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:35.560]   it's like having a really great car
[00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:36.840]   with a really great engine in it
[00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:38.960]   that you use to drive to the market and back in.
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:41.040]   It's nice to have that extra badge
[00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:42.200]   on the side of your car,
[00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:43.800]   but you got to have a way to use it.
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:46.240]   And right now, Android doesn't have a whole lot of ways
[00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:48.440]   that you can really, really squeeze those horses
[00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:49.760]   out of the CPU.
[00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:51.360]   - And the chatroom's saying,
[00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:53.240]   and I think they're absolutely right,
[00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:57.280]   battery life is going to be a real big question mark
[00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:59.200]   with a dual processor phone.
[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:00.920]   I don't know if they're going to be able to make,
[00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:02.840]   well, the battery life and the iPad is closed,
[00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:05.400]   but it's a, well, I think it's a little lower, don't you?
[00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:07.920]   - I haven't noticed honestly.
[00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:09.720]   - Yeah, I mean, it's so long that I don't notice either,
[00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:10.560]   but I think it's--
[00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:12.240]   - Yeah, it's hard.
[00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:14.480]   I didn't do a full drain to zero test.
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:17.800]   I did a series of 50% drain tests.
[00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:20.520]   And I came to the conclusion that it's about the same
[00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:21.600]   capacity as the original.
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:24.000]   If it's far off, if it's off, it's not far enough
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.440]   to make a plan about it.
[00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:28.520]   But remember that on the iPad, they have so much,
[00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:30.400]   the fact that it's a device that's big means
[00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:32.200]   they can just pack it with batteries.
[00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:36.400]   I think that if Apple decides to go for a larger screen iPhone,
[00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:37.240]   one of the reasons is that,
[00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:39.440]   but look how much bigger a battery we can put in there
[00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:40.760]   if we just make it bigger,
[00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:44.400]   we can also put it in an HDMI port.
[00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:46.720]   - Some people are saying that the Atrix battery life
[00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:51.280]   is very good, but I think PC Magazine said six hours
[00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:54.040]   and 44 minutes, that's not long enough.
[00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:56.560]   If you don't get through a day,
[00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:58.680]   maybe, I guess if you only work a six hour day,
[00:30:58.680 --> 00:30:59.760]   that's all right.
[00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:01.040]   If you don't get through a day,
[00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:02.520]   I think that's a non-starter.
[00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:06.200]   I think actually, this is one area where iPhone 4
[00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:08.320]   really does have a leg up for two reasons.
[00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:10.040]   One, it does have battery battery life,
[00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:10.880]   a better battery life.
[00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:12.800]   And two, there's a number of companies like
[00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:16.240]   Mophie and A. and Tekian that make battery cases.
[00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:17.880]   I don't see any of those for the Android phones.
[00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:19.840]   And so I can guarantee, when I need,
[00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:23.080]   when I have to be away from a plug for 12 hours,
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:24.560]   there's only one phone I can take with me,
[00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:25.840]   and that's the iPhone.
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:27.200]   - Well, I think that's probably one of the things
[00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:28.680]   you went into with the fragmentation
[00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:31.320]   of the Android market is that you're going to have
[00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:34.400]   fewer accessories because there may be a lot
[00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:37.280]   of Android phones, but you're not gonna have,
[00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:41.040]   you know, individual battery cases made for each one of them
[00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:43.280]   because the economy's just scaled just aren't there.
[00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:45.200]   - Right, exactly.
[00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:47.720]   Yeah, I mean, if you're an accessory manufacturer,
[00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:49.960]   the iPhone is a no-brainer.
[00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:52.480]   - Yeah, I mean, there's a dearth of cases
[00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:54.800]   or accessories for any Android phone.
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:58.560]   - Yeah, if the conversation got a little bit longer,
[00:31:58.560 --> 00:31:59.720]   it would have fished out of my bag.
[00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:01.880]   I'm traveling, which means that I have my...
[00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:03.200]   - Fish. - I have my...
[00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:04.840]   - What ever I travel. - Fish away, Andy.
[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:05.680]   - Go fish, Andy.
[00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:08.040]   - Go fish. - I'll have the grapple,
[00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:09.120]   but you can see me look for something
[00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:11.680]   in my own command-sized purse of a thing.
[00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:16.200]   But I just absolutely, I don't travel without this thing here,
[00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:20.320]   which is the new Trent, like huge, huge rechargeable USB
[00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:23.520]   battery pack that means that will not be stuck
[00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:25.160]   at an airport as long as anything has a USB port.
[00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:26.760]   - I have one like that from ever ready.
[00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:29.320]   - Yeah, that'll charge your phones, will it charge your laptop?
[00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:30.400]   - I won't charge my laptop,
[00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:33.600]   but it's powerful enough to give a complete recharge
[00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:34.680]   to the iPad.
[00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:39.400]   I mean, it's serious, it's like it's 11.1 amp hours.
[00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:40.960]   - Yeah, I carry one of those with me too.
[00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:43.800]   Those are very handy. - If you want extra battery,
[00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:46.000]   get some extra battery, don't mess around with it.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   But it's also a question of just being smart
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.640]   the way you design these things,
[00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:52.440]   not to turn this whole thing into a review of this phone.
[00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:56.400]   But remember that if I'm having a long, long travel day
[00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:58.040]   where I'm out of my hotel at 6 a.m.
[00:32:58.040 --> 00:32:59.840]   and I have to have a working phone
[00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:01.640]   until I get home at 11 p.m.
[00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:03.760]   I have options, I can turn off the 3G,
[00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:06.960]   I can do a whole bunch of things to consider the battery.
[00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:09.160]   But this one, you can't turn off the 4G radio
[00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:12.160]   and drop it down to something that consumes less power.
[00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:13.000]   So that's gonna become,
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.400]   as this is, I think this is one of the reasons
[00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:18.560]   why Apple decides not to play that sort of bullet chart game.
[00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:21.600]   They don't care if whatever website does a comparison
[00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:24.400]   between four phones and that there isn't the green check mark
[00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:26.400]   next to the iPhone in this category,
[00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:27.880]   they're really concerned about,
[00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:30.960]   let's produce a total package phone
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:33.280]   that makes sense as a total package.
[00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:37.120]   We don't care if this has one core instead of two cores.
[00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:39.520]   We don't care if this has 3G and 4G.
[00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:40.680]   We wanna make sure this is just
[00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:42.280]   a really good experience for the user.
[00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:43.720]   - All right, well it's that time once again.
[00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:45.840]   We have to ask this question every week
[00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:47.800]   and we've got two people who should know,
[00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:50.600]   they're on the inside, they have the insight,
[00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:54.200]   they are the seers, the peerless prognosticators
[00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:56.920]   of iPhone shipping dates.
[00:33:56.920 --> 00:34:00.840]   Will we see an iPhone 5 in June, Adam Anxt?
[00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:02.600]   (laughs)
[00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:04.440]   - I'm betting no for right now.
[00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:09.040]   It just, and usually you start hearing more wrunglings
[00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:12.640]   and we know that Apple's doing the big WWDC,
[00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:17.480]   NACWIS 10 Lion, either release or certainly something
[00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:18.920]   very close to release there
[00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:21.240]   and it feels like a little too much all at once
[00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:23.840]   and Apple likes to spread things out
[00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:24.880]   just a little bit more than that.
[00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:27.480]   - Are they gonna wait for iOS 5?
[00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:30.400]   - It feels to me as though they'll either wait for iOS 5
[00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:32.920]   or have it very close after.
[00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:35.960]   I mean they don't, usually again, they do like to mix that
[00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:39.480]   where they sometimes have had trouble is like they'll have,
[00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:43.440]   I think they've mixed with the iPod touch and the iPhone
[00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:45.400]   where they've not quite gotten them in sync
[00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:46.720]   with the iOS versions.
[00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:48.800]   And so that's the only question, but, I mean,
[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:51.400]   we often see a new iPod touch in September,
[00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:55.040]   so it feels to me like they could turn that iPod announcement
[00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:58.080]   they usually have in September into the iPhone
[00:34:58.080 --> 00:34:59.280]   and iOS 5 announcement.
[00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:01.000]   - You agree, Andy?
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:01.880]   - I'm really not sure.
[00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:03.680]   I agree with Adam in the sense that
[00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:07.040]   when you evaluate rumors or try to pronounce
[00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:08.160]   to give us the sort of stuff,
[00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:10.320]   it usually, it's not so much the data you get
[00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:13.760]   as the velocity and the tenor of the data you get.
[00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:15.880]   And I'm not getting that sort of feed,
[00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:18.720]   I'm not getting that sort of sense of the sort of stuff
[00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:21.720]   I should be hearing and should be both in front channels
[00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:23.880]   and back channels right now to think
[00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:24.960]   that there's gonna be an iPhone 5.
[00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:27.520]   I don't, but the fact of the matter is, I just don't know.
[00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:30.320]   The interesting thing though, is that if we decide,
[00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:34.000]   if we think that Apple is not going to be releasing
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:37.040]   a phone the same week that they do the developers conference,
[00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:39.720]   that allows the mind to wander a little bit.
[00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:42.240]   And think about, does this mean that the iPhone 5
[00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:43.840]   will have a certain hardware feature
[00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:46.320]   that will require a lot of developer support,
[00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:48.700]   therefore requiring developers to have two months
[00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:50.480]   of advanced notice or a month of advanced notice
[00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:51.680]   before they release the hardware.
[00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:54.880]   - So they might say show iOS 5 and say,
[00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:56.980]   "Get ready because we want you to have
[00:35:56.980 --> 00:35:59.320]   the new super duper jet pack feature."
[00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:02.360]   - Yeah, like two days, like one day, no,
[00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:04.080]   not two days later, one day later,
[00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:06.760]   someone will reveal something really, really deep,
[00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:08.760]   deep buried in the new version of Xcode
[00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:11.200]   or in some sort of documentation that says,
[00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:13.900]   "Oh, and by the way, to enable your applications
[00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:17.000]   to automatically scale to any arbitrary screen size,
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.620]   simply pass this value to your window."
[00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:21.020]   - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:21.860]   - arbitrary, what?
[00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:24.020]   - "Arbatory screen size."
[00:36:24.020 --> 00:36:26.220]   - "New field communications" seems like a good bet
[00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:28.660]   for a feature.
[00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:30.420]   I could see Apple sprints saying,
[00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:31.660]   they're going to do this by the end of the year.
[00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:33.860]   They're going to start offering a pay service
[00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:35.460]   that supports new field communications.
[00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:39.540]   That's the chip that Google put into the Google Nexus S
[00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:43.300]   and rumors are might be in a new iPhone
[00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:45.800]   that allows you to kind of wave your phone
[00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:47.660]   in front of a cash register
[00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:50.780]   and automatically debit your account.
[00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:52.100]   - Is it all on the wrist there?
[00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:53.860]   Leo, is that the wrist?
[00:36:53.860 --> 00:36:56.140]   - You know, if you want to practice,
[00:36:56.140 --> 00:36:59.260]   just get Star Wars Episode 3 and go,
[00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:00.840]   "These aren't the droids you're looking for.
[00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:01.680]   It's just like that.
[00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:02.780]   It's that same--
[00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:05.340]   - I think you beat Episode 4, 8, 8.
[00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:07.340]   - I did I say 3, 4, of course.
[00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:08.660]   Oh, God.
[00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:09.980]   - At least I didn't say Star Trek,
[00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:11.380]   which I am wants to do.
[00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:14.780]   These aren't the droids, you're, see that?
[00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:15.740]   (laughing)
[00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:17.120]   This is the droids you're looking for.
[00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:19.520]   I could totally see the Motorola ad.
[00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:20.720]   This is the droids you're looking for.
[00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:23.200]   So, as long as they're paying Lucas,
[00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:24.800]   you might as well give him more.
[00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:25.640]   (laughing)
[00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:27.680]   But that would be, and I could just,
[00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:30.880]   if anybody were to do this and do it effectively,
[00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:33.240]   it's not going to be Google, it would be Apple
[00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:38.240]   with a whole e-commerce system built in.
[00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:41.160]   - Not only that, but they're the only company that could,
[00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:43.200]   this is the only company that could simply say,
[00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:45.700]   we're going to sell 14 million phones this year,
[00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:48.220]   and every one of them is going to have this feature on it.
[00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:49.220]   And it's not going to be something
[00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:51.340]   that people have to pay an extra five or 10 bucks for.
[00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:53.220]   They're simply going to get it for free.
[00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:56.140]   So that doesn't mean that this sort of pay system
[00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:58.300]   is going to really take off in that year,
[00:37:58.300 --> 00:37:59.740]   but there might be enough of a base
[00:37:59.740 --> 00:38:02.260]   that if you go to an event, for instance,
[00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:04.780]   it might be worth the while for the t-shirt vendors
[00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:06.820]   to simply have that sort of pay system set up
[00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:09.860]   because it'll support the one most popular phone.
[00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:12.020]   But every time I see one of these alternative pay systems,
[00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:13.880]   I wish I had it with me.
[00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:15.400]   I often wear it when I travel.
[00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:19.360]   I have my son, microsystems, Java ring,
[00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:20.960]   which looks like-- - What?
[00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:22.280]   (laughing)
[00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:24.600]   - It's the most incredible-- - It's the most--
[00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:26.080]   - Remember that.
[00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:27.840]   - It's actually, if you could imagine
[00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:30.840]   like this looking like a high school or college ring,
[00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:32.760]   only has like a button on the front of it
[00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:36.320]   and says digital decoder engraved on the face of the ring.
[00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:38.400]   And actually inside this little button,
[00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:39.680]   it's just like I'm going to encapsulate it
[00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:42.640]   like little mecca wafer of metal.
[00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:45.940]   It is actually a one wire, one chip computer
[00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:48.640]   that you could tap it against a blue pad
[00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:50.720]   that would be against a coffee maker,
[00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:53.520]   a soda dispenser, a doorway for security.
[00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:56.340]   And just with that one Wonder Twin powers tap,
[00:38:56.340 --> 00:38:58.760]   it would make the content power the computer
[00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:00.500]   because it has 128 bit encryption.
[00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:02.640]   It could do things like have a conversation saying,
[00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:06.180]   yes, this is Andy likes a Coke classic,
[00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:09.100]   but only if it's at 38.4 degrees.
[00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:11.380]   If it's warmer than 40 degrees, don't bother.
[00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:13.820]   If you do have it in stock and it's that temperature,
[00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:16.660]   deduct $1.25 from the money that he's loaded
[00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:17.820]   into the syring and make the purchase.
[00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:18.820]   - When's that gonna come out?
[00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:19.860]   That sounds great.
[00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:21.760]   - Well, it's gonna come out in 1997.
[00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:24.220]   (laughing)
[00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:26.940]   Sun Microsystems gave these away at a developer conference
[00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:28.520]   where they introduced, it was an operating system
[00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:29.700]   called Java cards.
[00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:31.420]   They gave them away to all these developers.
[00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:33.500]   And at that conference, you could tap it
[00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:35.460]   against a coffee machine and it would give you the coffee
[00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:37.260]   exactly the way you like it.
[00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:39.340]   So if it had taken off, it would have been fun,
[00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:41.100]   but instead it's just a conversation piece
[00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:42.220]   that I used to make people think
[00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:44.300]   that actually graduated from high school.
[00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:47.220]   So, but the difference here is that this could work
[00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:49.660]   because it won't be something you actually have to wear
[00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:51.540]   on your wrist or on your finger.
[00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:54.220]   It would be just a feature that's inside your phone
[00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:56.100]   that you weren't aware of until you were aware that,
[00:39:56.100 --> 00:39:58.980]   oh wait, my supermarket just put up this placard
[00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:00.540]   next to every single register saying,
[00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:02.940]   you can now pay with your iPhone if you have an iPhone 5.
[00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:03.780]   - Yeah, no.
[00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:04.620]   In the words of Kim Kardashian,
[00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:06.500]   it's all about the back end.
[00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:07.860]   (laughing)
[00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:09.860]   You gotta, sorry.
[00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:13.060]   You got, you very hip reference, Leo.
[00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:13.980]   I'm very, very, well.
[00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:15.420]   - I almost said JLo and then I thought,
[00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:16.620]   no, I can update that.
[00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:22.340]   No, but you got, it means meaningless to have the front end
[00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:24.140]   if you don't have the back end, if you know what I'm saying.
[00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:26.740]   And you gotta, you, oh, I'm gonna.
[00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:28.140]   - And we have a show title.
[00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:30.400]   (laughing)
[00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:34.580]   - Anything to say, Adam, anything at all.
[00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:35.420]   - Yep.
[00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:37.660]   (laughing)
[00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:44.460]   - It's Apple's new money maker.
[00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:48.940]   - I, actually, I'm on all seriousness,
[00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:51.140]   I think that that is a feature
[00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:53.300]   that we will absolutely see by the fall.
[00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:55.660]   Do you think, you agree with Adam, Andy,
[00:40:55.660 --> 00:40:58.540]   that September, instead of an iPod announcement,
[00:40:58.540 --> 00:41:00.940]   we get iPhone 4 or 5.
[00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:03.380]   - Well, here's the thing that with iPads,
[00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:04.660]   I mean, the iPod announcements.
[00:41:04.660 --> 00:41:06.380]   - You don't need to announce iPods anymore.
[00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:08.140]   Nobody's buying iPods.
[00:41:08.140 --> 00:41:10.740]   - I mean, the whole business is going down.
[00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:13.500]   I mean, it basically had a great run.
[00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:16.300]   Apple sold a bazillion of them.
[00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:17.420]   But, you know, let's face it,
[00:41:17.420 --> 00:41:19.620]   they can't really make them any smaller at this point.
[00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:21.580]   People start, you know, losing them in the, you know,
[00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:23.220]   swallowing them and stuff.
[00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:26.380]   - Well, they tried that with the Trident gum
[00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:28.820]   and a rod pod and it was too small.
[00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:29.660]   - It took tech for a bit.
[00:41:29.660 --> 00:41:30.500]   - Yeah, it was too small.
[00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:31.340]   - It's like old play.
[00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:32.180]   - Yeah.
[00:41:32.180 --> 00:41:33.740]   (laughing)
[00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:35.620]   - So yeah, so I think that would make sense
[00:41:35.620 --> 00:41:36.700]   and they could have, you know,
[00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:38.780]   the iPhone iPod touch announcement.
[00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:40.740]   And oh, by the way, here's our latest iPod, no, no.
[00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:41.580]   - Right.
[00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:42.420]   And they may not even mention it.
[00:41:42.420 --> 00:41:44.100]   They may just say, yeah, we got that thing.
[00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:46.380]   But this would also make sense from the point of view
[00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:48.820]   of Verizon customers who got theirs in January.
[00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:50.380]   That's at least nine months.
[00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:52.340]   At least you got some time.
[00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:53.340]   What about people who say,
[00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:56.180]   "Man, maybe Apple will just start doing it every other year,
[00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:59.300]   giving you two years to use up your contract.
[00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:00.420]   You could make the same case.
[00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:03.100]   There's not a lot of new stuff to put in an iPhone.
[00:42:03.100 --> 00:42:04.580]   - Five.
[00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:05.420]   - I don't think so.
[00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:09.220]   I think Apple's very interested in keeping their lead
[00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:11.620]   that six month kind of first mover advantage
[00:42:11.620 --> 00:42:14.540]   that they keep, they have and they're not letting go of.
[00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:16.980]   And they keep leapfrogging everyone else
[00:42:16.980 --> 00:42:19.380]   who catches up and Apple jumps forward again.
[00:42:19.380 --> 00:42:21.300]   I pad iPhone.
[00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:22.140]   They're just, you know,
[00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:24.340]   I don't think they're gonna let up the pressure on that
[00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:25.180]   for a while.
[00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:26.740]   - You agree, Andy?
[00:42:26.740 --> 00:42:27.660]   - I think so.
[00:42:27.660 --> 00:42:29.780]   Especially because Android,
[00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:31.940]   the whole selling feature of an Android phone is,
[00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:34.620]   no matter what shape, size, form factor or Vogue,
[00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:35.940]   you're interested in this year.
[00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:39.180]   There is an Android phone that can suit that need,
[00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:40.420]   I mean, if you don't like,
[00:42:40.420 --> 00:42:42.820]   they're the sort of variety that,
[00:42:42.820 --> 00:42:46.140]   if you don't like the idea that this phone has a kickstand,
[00:42:46.140 --> 00:42:48.620]   you can probably find a version of this from HTC
[00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:49.700]   that has every single feature,
[00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:50.700]   but it does not have a kickstand.
[00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:51.540]   - Absolutely.
[00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:53.940]   - It can, and so, I don't think that Apple would let the,
[00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:55.860]   just watch the pitch go by for two whole years,
[00:42:55.860 --> 00:42:57.020]   waiting for a new model to come up.
[00:42:57.020 --> 00:42:58.300]   - It is moving very quickly.
[00:42:58.300 --> 00:42:59.900]   And in some ways, Apple,
[00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:02.180]   Apple's slow cycle has been a disadvantage,
[00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:03.820]   but in many ways it's been a real advantage
[00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:05.620]   as they watch the market fragmentation
[00:43:05.620 --> 00:43:07.060]   in the Android space.
[00:43:07.060 --> 00:43:09.180]   It's a, I'll tell you, it's fascinating.
[00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:10.420]   And since this stuff has to be done
[00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:12.700]   at least a year ahead of time,
[00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:15.420]   there really some interesting calculation going on.
[00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:17.020]   I will give you in a minute,
[00:43:17.020 --> 00:43:20.020]   the stunning figures from ComScore
[00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:22.300]   on Android versus iPhone,
[00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:25.860]   and more too coming up, including our picks of the week,
[00:43:25.860 --> 00:43:28.100]   but before we do anything else,
[00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:30.020]   I'm gonna mention our great friends at Citrix
[00:43:30.020 --> 00:43:33.300]   who make that wonderful suite of applications
[00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:34.420]   based on remote access.
[00:43:34.420 --> 00:43:35.900]   It starts with, of course,
[00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:37.900]   the Citrix Enterprise remote access,
[00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:39.100]   which is the best in the business,
[00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:41.580]   but there's a whole lot more.
[00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:43.940]   Go to my PC, go to webinar,
[00:43:43.940 --> 00:43:44.940]   and of course go to meeting.
[00:43:44.940 --> 00:43:47.100]   If you are traveling a lot,
[00:43:47.100 --> 00:43:52.060]   and I know there are people who just spend a whole lot of time
[00:43:52.060 --> 00:43:55.540]   getting airplanes and going to visit clients and colleagues,
[00:43:55.540 --> 00:43:58.980]   it's just obvious that you've gotta stop that.
[00:43:58.980 --> 00:44:01.780]   You've gotta start doing more teleconferencing.
[00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:04.180]   But if you've ever hosted an online meeting,
[00:44:04.180 --> 00:44:06.980]   a teleconference, you know how hard it is
[00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:08.460]   to get them started on time,
[00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:11.300]   to get it, keep it moving along,
[00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:12.900]   to make it effective, and your reputation,
[00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:13.900]   if you're the meeting maker,
[00:44:13.900 --> 00:44:16.300]   your reputation is online, on the line here.
[00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:22.180]   Go to meeting is fast, easy, reliable online meeting.
[00:44:22.180 --> 00:44:25.100]   It's easy for you to set up.
[00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:28.580]   You don't need any special help from the IT department.
[00:44:28.580 --> 00:44:31.420]   And even easier for your clients to use,
[00:44:31.420 --> 00:44:34.220]   I think that's pretty critical, don't you agree?
[00:44:34.220 --> 00:44:35.460]   You can't make them jump through hoops
[00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:37.620]   if you wanna give them a sales presentation.
[00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:39.460]   It's simple, you send them an email.
[00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:41.740]   First, here's what you do, it's free for 30 days.
[00:44:41.740 --> 00:44:44.620]   So, install GoToMeeting, Mac or PC,

[00:44:53.820 --> 00:44:55.860]   use Mac Break as your coupon code.

[00:45:01.060 --> 00:45:03.340]   Now, this is the beauty part.
[00:45:03.340 --> 00:45:05.180]   Next time you wanna hold a meeting,
[00:45:05.180 --> 00:45:06.740]   if you're on a Windows PC,
[00:45:06.740 --> 00:45:07.700]   your Outlook is integrated.
[00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:08.540]   I'm not sure on a Mac,
[00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:09.500]   I guess you have to go to the website,
[00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:10.340]   but you click a button,
[00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:12.620]   and it creates an email for you
[00:45:12.620 --> 00:45:13.940]   with all the meeting information,
[00:45:13.940 --> 00:45:15.460]   including a conference bridge.
[00:45:15.460 --> 00:45:17.300]   That comes with it for free,
[00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:19.740]   a phone conference bridge.
[00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:23.060]   They click the link, they get the software 30 seconds later,
[00:45:23.060 --> 00:45:23.900]   and it's always up to date,
[00:45:23.900 --> 00:45:25.660]   'cause each time they'll download new software,
[00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:27.060]   but very quickly,
[00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:29.180]   all they have to do is click the link in the email
[00:45:29.180 --> 00:45:30.660]   and say allow, and boom,
[00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:33.860]   they're seeing your desktop.
[00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:35.580]   They're seeing the conference bridge number,
[00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:36.220]   they can press,
[00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:37.860]   press a button and use their own speakers
[00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:40.540]   and microphone on their laptop,
[00:45:40.540 --> 00:45:43.260]   or iPad, there's great iPad app for this.
[00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:47.260]   It is just easy, simple and reliable,
[00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:49.420]   and it impresses people with your efficiency.
[00:45:49.420 --> 00:45:52.540]   They say, wow, you know, this works really well.
[00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:54.420]   In fact, that's one of the cool things about GoToMeeting,
[00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:55.780]   it kind of sells itself.
[00:45:55.780 --> 00:45:58.020]   Just try it once and you'll see why people use this.
[00:45:58.020 --> 00:45:59.540]   Reduce your meeting expenses,
[00:45:59.540 --> 00:46:02.140]   reduce the overhead and preparing meeting materials,
[00:46:02.140 --> 00:46:04.020]   free conferencing built in,
[00:46:04.020 --> 00:46:07.020]   and a very affordable $49 a month.
[00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:09.700]   That's a lot less than even one trip across town
[00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:11.740]   to hold a presentation.
[00:46:11.740 --> 00:46:13.980]   All the meetings you want to for 49 bucks a month.
[00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:14.820]   Here's what you do,

[00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:30.260]   Mac Break Weekly on the air,
[00:46:30.260 --> 00:46:32.420]   Alex Lindsey's on assignment in Paris.
[00:46:32.420 --> 00:46:35.460]   What kind of assignment?
[00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:38.820]   I think Kwasant's an expo, I believe.
[00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:39.660]   Yeah.
[00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:41.860]   He's on a Kwasant assignment, Lucky Dog.
[00:46:41.860 --> 00:46:43.780]   Is he actually working, Eileen?
[00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:46.660]   Or is he just, he's just flipping around enjoying--
[00:46:46.660 --> 00:46:47.740]   That gets some brie.
[00:46:47.740 --> 00:46:51.100]   April in Paris.
[00:46:51.100 --> 00:46:51.940]   He's son of a--
[00:46:51.940 --> 00:46:52.780]   Kicking Kami butt.
[00:46:52.780 --> 00:46:54.460]   He's cats what he's doing.
[00:46:54.460 --> 00:46:56.060]   That's what he's up to.
[00:46:56.060 --> 00:46:58.300]   He's making sure that never again--
[00:46:58.300 --> 00:46:59.780]   Godspeed, Alex Lindsey.
[00:46:59.780 --> 00:47:05.380]   Those Axis powers will never again
[00:47:05.380 --> 00:47:07.460]   threaten our nation's shores.
[00:47:07.460 --> 00:47:10.540]   And to think they'll never be a muddy metallic, Lindsey.
[00:47:10.540 --> 00:47:11.700]   They'll just simply disappear
[00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:13.500]   and the government won't be able to acknowledge.
[00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:14.340]   That's right.
[00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:15.220]   That's right.
[00:47:15.220 --> 00:47:16.060]   The Lindsey Identity.
[00:47:16.060 --> 00:47:17.900]   It's an Omaha, Nebraska, who are alive today,
[00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:21.100]   because that missile never got launched.
[00:47:21.100 --> 00:47:23.260]   That's Andy Inako Chicago Sun Times, his website,
[00:47:23.260 --> 00:47:24.820]   is cwob.com.
[00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:25.940]   Adam Banks is here too.
[00:47:25.940 --> 00:47:29.660]   And boy, he is the young looking guy,
[00:47:29.660 --> 00:47:31.820]   but that's because he runs miles and miles every day
[00:47:31.820 --> 00:47:34.820]   to maintain his youthful appearance.
[00:47:34.820 --> 00:47:37.380]   But he has the longest running journalist
[00:47:37.380 --> 00:47:41.660]   in the Mac space, in the Apple space, for 21 years now,
[00:47:41.660 --> 00:47:42.900]   tidbits.com.
[00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:45.260]   If you are not a subscriber to this free newsletter,
[00:47:45.260 --> 00:47:48.900]   you must just go right there and get it.
[00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:50.460]   Every week that comes in and that, frankly,
[00:47:50.460 --> 00:47:53.820]   that provides the grist for the mill.
[00:47:53.820 --> 00:47:55.020]   Turn in the wheel.
[00:47:55.020 --> 00:47:56.500]   Yeah, I don't know how you do it.
[00:47:56.500 --> 00:47:57.340]   Really?
[00:47:57.340 --> 00:48:01.140]   But why did you make that your full-time job?
[00:48:01.140 --> 00:48:04.900]   Um, pretty much 1992.
[00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:07.820]   That was when we invented advertising on the internet,
[00:48:07.820 --> 00:48:11.580]   which Google still hasn't thanked me for.
[00:48:11.580 --> 00:48:13.980]   Were you the first, really, to have ads?
[00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:15.180]   Yeah, yeah, 1982.
[00:48:15.180 --> 00:48:16.180]   I thank you for that.
[00:48:16.180 --> 00:48:17.180]   For sure.
[00:48:17.180 --> 00:48:18.180]   I thank you for that.
[00:48:18.180 --> 00:48:19.180]   I thank you for that.
[00:48:19.180 --> 00:48:20.180]   Really?
[00:48:20.180 --> 00:48:21.180]   Wow.
[00:48:21.180 --> 00:48:22.180]   That's amazing.
[00:48:22.180 --> 00:48:23.180]   I thank you for that, Adam.
[00:48:23.180 --> 00:48:24.180]   Yeah.
[00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:25.180]   Uh, and...
[00:48:25.180 --> 00:48:26.180]   Well, I'm a lot of talker.
[00:48:26.180 --> 00:48:27.340]   In many ways, this show wouldn't exist.
[00:48:27.340 --> 00:48:29.420]   A lot of the new media that goes on wouldn't exist
[00:48:29.420 --> 00:48:32.380]   if you hadn't proven the concept that you could, in fact,
[00:48:32.380 --> 00:48:36.540]   not be mainstream, big shot newspaper.
[00:48:36.540 --> 00:48:39.620]   And you could make a living covering stuff that people care
[00:48:39.620 --> 00:48:41.020]   obsessively about.
[00:48:41.020 --> 00:48:43.940]   I found it fascinating when blogging became a big deal
[00:48:43.940 --> 00:48:44.940]   but I was really, but...
[00:48:44.940 --> 00:48:45.940]   But how was this different?
[00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:46.940]   Over the years.
[00:48:46.940 --> 00:48:47.940]   Over the years.
[00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:48.940]   For about ten years.
[00:48:48.940 --> 00:48:51.940]   And we should give credit to your wife, Tanya, too.
[00:48:51.940 --> 00:48:52.940]   It's a lot of credit.
[00:48:52.940 --> 00:48:54.860]   All right, so Tibbets was her idea to begin with.
[00:48:54.860 --> 00:48:56.300]   So she gets all the credit.
[00:48:56.300 --> 00:48:57.300]   Yeah.
[00:48:57.300 --> 00:48:58.300]   It's funny.
[00:48:58.300 --> 00:48:59.300]   Why do we have you on the show then?
[00:48:59.300 --> 00:49:00.620]   Yeah, it hurt last time.
[00:49:00.620 --> 00:49:01.620]   Oh, okay.
[00:49:01.620 --> 00:49:03.340]   We do tag team.
[00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:05.020]   We love you both.
[00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:09.860]   So ComScore says, "ComScore is, I think, a fairly reliable source
[00:49:09.860 --> 00:49:10.860]   of information.
[00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:12.500]   They're not exactly IDC."
[00:49:12.500 --> 00:49:13.500]   Hey, sound?
[00:49:13.500 --> 00:49:14.500]   Oh, anyway.
[00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:15.500]   What was his name?
[00:49:15.500 --> 00:49:16.500]   ComScore.
[00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:18.940]   I'm not sure how they know this.
[00:49:18.940 --> 00:49:19.940]   Let me put it this way.
[00:49:19.940 --> 00:49:22.820]   I trust ComScore's ratings of websites.
[00:49:22.820 --> 00:49:26.940]   I think that they're very accurate in measuring website traffic.
[00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:32.500]   I don't know how they measure mobile handset sales.
[00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:33.860]   That's the only question mark.
[00:49:33.860 --> 00:49:38.900]   But they say somehow they know this, that Android is just
[00:49:38.900 --> 00:49:44.580]   dominating a seven point gain in market share.
[00:49:44.580 --> 00:49:48.140]   Market share in the past three months in the US.
[00:49:48.140 --> 00:49:50.380]   Rims market share is collapsing.
[00:49:50.380 --> 00:49:53.580]   Blackberry dropped five points in the last quarter.
[00:49:53.580 --> 00:50:00.020]   iPhone share increased slightly unless you include iPod touches, which I think in some
[00:50:00.020 --> 00:50:04.380]   ways you ought to because it touches really the phone without the phone.
[00:50:04.380 --> 00:50:11.620]   In any event, according to ComScore, Android is just clobbering everyone with one third
[00:50:11.620 --> 00:50:13.300]   of the market share.
[00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:16.900]   Rims 29%, Apple 25%.
[00:50:16.900 --> 00:50:25.860]   And the soon to be number one phone platform, Windows Phone 7, went from 9% to 7.7%.
[00:50:25.860 --> 00:50:31.140]   So guys, you better start running if you're going to catch up Palm 2.8%.
[00:50:31.140 --> 00:50:35.500]   So first, are these numbers reliable?
[00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:36.980]   I don't know.
[00:50:36.980 --> 00:50:38.460]   I've been...
[00:50:38.460 --> 00:50:41.060]   No, by all means.
[00:50:41.060 --> 00:50:43.300]   Adam, what do you think?
[00:50:43.300 --> 00:50:45.060]   I don't know.
[00:50:45.060 --> 00:50:46.460]   I mean, it's one of those things.
[00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:47.460]   Or does it matter?
[00:50:47.460 --> 00:50:53.420]   I mean, 25% is actually a pretty decent market share for a single platform, single phone.
[00:50:53.420 --> 00:50:57.820]   Yeah, I think the problems with this data is how it's going to be interpreted by so
[00:50:57.820 --> 00:50:58.820]   many other people.
[00:50:58.820 --> 00:51:01.820]   I've been reading a couple of pieces, actually series of pieces that have been posted on
[00:51:01.820 --> 00:51:08.380]   businessinsider.com that are using that as really as a way to justify every single
[00:51:08.380 --> 00:51:10.980]   opinion about how well Apple's day is over.
[00:51:10.980 --> 00:51:12.740]   They had an amusing run.
[00:51:12.740 --> 00:51:17.980]   But eventually the power of an open platform and not controlling your users or your developers
[00:51:17.980 --> 00:51:23.260]   proves the day without really coming up with any information to support the idea that Apple's
[00:51:23.260 --> 00:51:24.260]   day is done.
[00:51:24.260 --> 00:51:28.740]   Again, I do think that it's a reflection of the volume of handsets that are actually
[00:51:28.740 --> 00:51:32.500]   out there, not on the one platform's dominance.
[00:51:32.500 --> 00:51:33.500]   And coincidentally...
[00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:34.500]   Yeah, I mean, if you think...
[00:51:34.500 --> 00:51:36.940]   And this is always the case with Mac versus Windows.
[00:51:36.940 --> 00:51:42.900]   If you kind of rephrase the statement to say, "iPhone, one quarter of all smartphones in
[00:51:42.900 --> 00:51:46.620]   the United States are iPhones," that sounds a little better, doesn't it?
[00:51:46.620 --> 00:51:51.820]   Yeah, also when you look at Google Analytics saying that iOS is still the absolutely dominant.
[00:51:51.820 --> 00:51:56.980]   In terms of mobile devices using the web, there's so many more iOS devices that are
[00:51:56.980 --> 00:52:00.500]   being tracked using websites than any Android device.
[00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:06.220]   So I don't think it's a defensive statement to say that, "Oh, well, that other data must
[00:52:06.220 --> 00:52:07.220]   be wrong."
[00:52:07.220 --> 00:52:12.220]   But just it's an illustration that if you want to decide that one company is absolutely
[00:52:12.220 --> 00:52:17.660]   dominating the market, you can really freely choose the metric that you want to select
[00:52:17.660 --> 00:52:19.100]   as the most important one.
[00:52:19.100 --> 00:52:21.340]   Is it the number of devices that are in the field being used?
[00:52:21.340 --> 00:52:23.660]   Is it the number of devices being sold?
[00:52:23.660 --> 00:52:27.060]   And then you can start splitting hairs to say, "Well, this is an Android phone, but it's
[00:52:27.060 --> 00:52:28.620]   still running 1.6."
[00:52:28.620 --> 00:52:30.820]   Does that really count against the total of numbers of the field?
[00:52:30.820 --> 00:52:31.820]   That's a good point too, actually.
[00:52:31.820 --> 00:52:32.820]   Yeah.
[00:52:32.820 --> 00:52:37.820]   Well, here's the other thing which I find interesting is that Apple is pretty clear about their
[00:52:37.820 --> 00:52:42.860]   numbers that every six months or so there's some event and Steve Jobs gets up there and
[00:52:42.860 --> 00:52:44.460]   said, "We've sold 20 million of these.
[00:52:44.460 --> 00:52:45.900]   We've sold 30 million of these.
[00:52:45.900 --> 00:52:49.660]   We're now up to 270 billion whatever."
[00:52:49.660 --> 00:52:51.340]   The numbers always keep coming.
[00:52:51.340 --> 00:52:57.300]   I actually really appreciate that because you could accuse them potentially of lying.
[00:52:57.300 --> 00:52:58.300]   They have the numbers of only...
[00:52:58.300 --> 00:53:00.260]   There's never been any evidence of that.
[00:53:00.260 --> 00:53:03.300]   The only question would be is sell through or is it into the channel?
[00:53:03.300 --> 00:53:04.820]   Yeah, this isn't a little twist here.
[00:53:04.820 --> 00:53:07.140]   But then you look at things like the Kindle.
[00:53:07.140 --> 00:53:08.140]   How many kindles have been sold?
[00:53:08.140 --> 00:53:09.140]   No idea.
[00:53:09.140 --> 00:53:10.140]   No idea.
[00:53:10.140 --> 00:53:12.140]   How many of these HTC Thunderbolts have been sold?
[00:53:12.140 --> 00:53:13.140]   No idea.
[00:53:13.140 --> 00:53:19.180]   Unless the companies are actually telling us this stuff, I personally always wonder a little
[00:53:19.180 --> 00:53:24.700]   bit because it's not like Apple as being the leaders being shy about their numbers.
[00:53:24.700 --> 00:53:28.300]   So if these other people are beating them, wouldn't they want to share their numbers
[00:53:28.300 --> 00:53:29.300]   too?
[00:53:29.300 --> 00:53:30.300]   Well, that's true.
[00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:35.540]   Although it is, of course, dozens of companies with several dozens of handsets.
[00:53:35.540 --> 00:53:36.540]   That's why I'm kind of...
[00:53:36.540 --> 00:53:38.820]   Which might not mean that's not...
[00:53:38.820 --> 00:53:42.620]   I'm curious how ComScore even calculates this.
[00:53:42.620 --> 00:53:46.540]   They do say that the Verizon iPhone was the number one phone in February.
[00:53:46.540 --> 00:53:48.740]   Yeah, that's what it's about.
[00:53:48.740 --> 00:53:51.780]   Yeah, I mean, that's when it came out in late January.
[00:53:51.780 --> 00:53:55.460]   So I guess that's not a surprise.
[00:53:55.460 --> 00:53:57.820]   What they do is they sample...
[00:53:57.820 --> 00:54:02.100]   So this came from a sample of 30,000 US mobile subscribers.
[00:54:02.100 --> 00:54:03.820]   It's like ratings.
[00:54:03.820 --> 00:54:05.420]   It's like surveys.
[00:54:05.420 --> 00:54:07.140]   It's like it's samples.
[00:54:07.140 --> 00:54:09.460]   You know, and there's a statistical model for this.
[00:54:09.460 --> 00:54:13.260]   So I'd say they're probably close.
[00:54:13.260 --> 00:54:16.820]   But I guess the question is, does it matter to Apple?
[00:54:16.820 --> 00:54:18.660]   Who it should matter to though is developers?
[00:54:18.660 --> 00:54:22.580]   And this is the point you're making, Andy, that Henry Blodgett and authors who are, you
[00:54:22.580 --> 00:54:27.060]   know, waving the flag for Android here are saying, "Well, this is going to persuade
[00:54:27.060 --> 00:54:31.060]   developers to write for Android as opposed to writing for Apple."
[00:54:31.060 --> 00:54:35.380]   You don't see a ground swell of developers moving to the Android platform?
[00:54:35.380 --> 00:54:36.620]   Not really.
[00:54:36.620 --> 00:54:37.820]   You have to be...
[00:54:37.820 --> 00:54:38.820]   It's...
[00:54:38.820 --> 00:54:44.020]   Developers, successful developers for a mobile platform seem to fall into two different categories.
[00:54:44.020 --> 00:54:49.340]   Either the well-funded professionals that are part of an existing development team, we're
[00:54:49.340 --> 00:54:52.700]   talking about electronic arts, we're talking about the team that does the Kindle app, that
[00:54:52.700 --> 00:54:56.100]   sort of stuff, or the people who just simply like the phone that they're using and are
[00:54:56.100 --> 00:54:57.540]   fairly passionate about it.
[00:54:57.540 --> 00:54:59.860]   They do program for a living and they developed...
[00:54:59.860 --> 00:55:02.740]   They have a great idea and they actually executed it.
[00:55:02.740 --> 00:55:06.580]   The developers that I've been talking to, and this is by no means a complete sample,
[00:55:06.580 --> 00:55:12.260]   I can't find any many examples of people who are so excited about the Android platform
[00:55:12.260 --> 00:55:14.500]   that they're willing to go beyond the idea.
[00:55:14.500 --> 00:55:17.460]   If I had this cute little idea for an app, I wrote it in a couple of days and I released
[00:55:17.460 --> 00:55:18.460]   it.
[00:55:18.460 --> 00:55:22.180]   We're not seeing the sort of people who are writing apps like Feedler for iOS, which
[00:55:22.180 --> 00:55:27.340]   is a very sophisticated and very mature RSS reader app for Google Reader.
[00:55:27.340 --> 00:55:31.420]   The fact that a Google phone doesn't yet have a really great Google Reader app, as far as
[00:55:31.420 --> 00:55:33.700]   I can tell, is kind of telling.
[00:55:33.700 --> 00:55:36.220]   I can name at least four for the four iOS.
[00:55:36.220 --> 00:55:38.380]   I've seen one that was very good.
[00:55:38.380 --> 00:55:42.220]   I saw a second one that was okay and the rest are more like, "Oh, so, you know, I'm
[00:55:42.220 --> 00:55:46.460]   going to show you how to open up a webpage that's been formatted with a superimposed
[00:55:46.460 --> 00:55:47.460]   CSS style sheet."
[00:55:47.460 --> 00:55:48.460]   Good!
[00:55:48.460 --> 00:55:51.860]   What happens on day two of your Android developer course?
[00:55:51.860 --> 00:55:53.300]   Well, don't be too dismissive.
[00:55:53.300 --> 00:55:58.260]   Fred Wilson, who is a very well-known and persuasive and I think really smart venture
[00:55:58.260 --> 00:56:09.700]   capitalist, is blog A, V, C. He says that after seeing these numbers and putting up these
[00:56:09.700 --> 00:56:17.700]   com score numbers, he says that he believes the mobile OS market will play out very similar
[00:56:17.700 --> 00:56:21.340]   to Windows and Macintosh with Android in the role of Windows.
[00:56:21.340 --> 00:56:27.060]   This is the important quote, "If you want to be in front of the largest number of users
[00:56:27.060 --> 00:56:29.260]   as a developer, you need to be on Android."
[00:56:29.260 --> 00:56:30.260]   Is that not true?
[00:56:30.260 --> 00:56:33.980]   But I think there's a different, I think, I mean, the obviously analogies easy to make,
[00:56:33.980 --> 00:56:39.980]   but it's a different situation because Apple with the Macintosh never had vast percentages
[00:56:39.980 --> 00:56:42.380]   of the market to start with.
[00:56:42.380 --> 00:56:47.100]   And so Android is coming in late in this case rather than being in a situation where
[00:56:47.100 --> 00:56:53.340]   Windows was basically coming in after DOS, which had the majority of the market when
[00:56:53.340 --> 00:56:54.340]   the Macintosh was new.
[00:56:54.340 --> 00:56:56.940]   Well, I think it's a different, it's a different evolution.
[00:56:56.940 --> 00:56:58.540]   I will grant you some stuff.
[00:56:58.540 --> 00:57:02.300]   In terms of, when you're talking about EA, they're going to develop for both because it's
[00:57:02.300 --> 00:57:07.900]   a big, I'm a quarter of the market shares plenty for them to make lots of money on a
[00:57:07.900 --> 00:57:09.300]   game on iOS.
[00:57:09.300 --> 00:57:12.780]   And they still want to have that Android marketplace and they can't afford the developers
[00:57:12.780 --> 00:57:13.780]   to do both.
[00:57:13.780 --> 00:57:17.420]   And I think you're right about independent developers, Andy, that they go where their
[00:57:17.420 --> 00:57:18.420]   heart is.
[00:57:18.420 --> 00:57:19.420]   Yeah.
[00:57:19.420 --> 00:57:24.020]   And I have to tell you, if I were a developer, heart or not, I have to look at the fact that
[00:57:24.020 --> 00:57:28.300]   developing for the iPhone is developing for a single platform that I know exactly what
[00:57:28.300 --> 00:57:31.060]   the capabilities are.
[00:57:31.060 --> 00:57:33.420]   I disagree with you in terms of development tools.
[00:57:33.420 --> 00:57:34.940]   There are free development tools for Android.
[00:57:34.940 --> 00:57:36.900]   A lot of people know Java.
[00:57:36.900 --> 00:57:39.060]   Maybe it's not quite as elegant as Xcode, but it's there.
[00:57:39.060 --> 00:57:41.660]   You don't have to pay the $99 developer fee.
[00:57:41.660 --> 00:57:45.860]   I think that developing for Android is as easy as developing for the iPhone.
[00:57:45.860 --> 00:57:50.260]   But I think that people are often going to say, "Well, but I know I'm going to get 25%
[00:57:50.260 --> 00:57:51.260]   market share.
[00:57:51.260 --> 00:57:55.420]   I know these people buy in-app purchases more than Android people.
[00:57:55.420 --> 00:57:57.740]   I'm content developing for the iPhone."
[00:57:57.740 --> 00:58:05.100]   I have to categorically just oppose any commentator who's saying that, "Well, the fact that there
[00:58:05.100 --> 00:58:09.820]   are more Android handsets or iOS handsets means that it's going to be more attractive
[00:58:09.820 --> 00:58:10.820]   to developers."
[00:58:10.820 --> 00:58:15.020]   I mean, both of you guys are in jobs of having a product and selling it to people.
[00:58:15.020 --> 00:58:19.740]   You know you'd much rather sell to a market of 50,000 people, 40% of whom are willing
[00:58:19.740 --> 00:58:25.380]   to give you money than get, "Well, what if you had your own show on NBC and maybe one
[00:58:25.380 --> 00:58:26.940]   quarter of those people?"
[00:58:26.940 --> 00:58:28.860]   Well, you hit the nail on the head.
[00:58:28.860 --> 00:58:30.980]   We both opted for niche products.
[00:58:30.980 --> 00:58:32.900]   So you're exactly right, Andy.
[00:58:32.900 --> 00:58:33.900]   We did that.
[00:58:33.900 --> 00:58:34.900]   Yeah.
[00:58:34.900 --> 00:58:35.900]   Yeah.
[00:58:35.900 --> 00:58:36.900]   No, I think it's absolutely true.
[00:58:36.900 --> 00:58:42.780]   And I was going to say too, is that you, just because you were put in front of a large
[00:58:42.780 --> 00:58:44.500]   audience means nothing.
[00:58:44.500 --> 00:58:45.500]   Right.
[00:58:45.500 --> 00:58:46.500]   It really does.
[00:58:46.500 --> 00:58:47.500]   It's pretty gross.
[00:58:47.500 --> 00:58:48.500]   I've lived it.
[00:58:48.500 --> 00:58:54.100]   Now, on the flip side of that is as Apple's draconian approval process, which I think no
[00:58:54.100 --> 00:58:59.700]   developer likes, and the fact that they take 30% of revenues.
[00:58:59.700 --> 00:59:03.700]   So there are negatives on the Apple platform, but I would say on the balance sheet, there's
[00:59:03.700 --> 00:59:06.620]   going to be plenty of independents who say, "Oh, no, I'm always going to develop for
[00:59:06.620 --> 00:59:07.620]   iOS."
[00:59:07.620 --> 00:59:09.540]   Like you, Andy, I talk to them every day.
[00:59:09.540 --> 00:59:10.540]   Yeah.
[00:59:10.540 --> 00:59:14.460]   Similarly, there are a lot of people who they quite legitimately and quite correctly,
[00:59:14.460 --> 00:59:17.540]   they just respond better to Android than to iOS.
[00:59:17.540 --> 00:59:20.540]   And those are developers who are going to say, "God, it kind of frustrates me that there
[00:59:20.540 --> 00:59:22.980]   isn't a really good Google Reader RSS Reader app.
[00:59:22.980 --> 00:59:25.500]   I'm going to build a very good one that's really, really awesome."
[00:59:25.500 --> 00:59:29.500]   And that guy is where that woman is going to own the market because it will be standout
[00:59:29.500 --> 00:59:31.140]   head and shoulders above everybody else.
[00:59:31.140 --> 00:59:38.380]   I'm really keen to see six months from now how the new Amazon Android App Store changes
[00:59:38.380 --> 00:59:41.860]   things, but actually makes those really great apps a lot easier to find.
[00:59:41.860 --> 00:59:47.340]   Well, it'll be interesting because Amazon extorts the same 30% and they set the price
[00:59:47.340 --> 00:59:50.340]   and they can even give it away for free if they feel like it.
[00:59:50.340 --> 00:59:52.820]   Yeah, but freedom is the freedom doesn't equal power.
[00:59:52.820 --> 00:59:55.500]   It's just another word for nothing else to do.
[00:59:55.500 --> 00:59:56.500]   Exactly.
[00:59:56.500 --> 01:00:00.900]   And again, if I hear a number from another person, he's like, "Oh, if your books are
[01:00:00.900 --> 01:00:05.660]   on Amazon, having your book on Amazon is again basically meaningless.
[01:00:05.660 --> 01:00:06.660]   Yes, you should do it."
[01:00:06.660 --> 01:00:08.460]   There's a guy who knows, by the way.
[01:00:08.460 --> 01:00:11.180]   Yeah, no, I've had books that don't well on Amazon.
[01:00:11.180 --> 01:00:13.820]   I've had books that have done nothing in Amazon.
[01:00:13.820 --> 01:00:19.500]   And the simple fact is that being in a very large store guarantees you nothing.
[01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:24.460]   Its possibility might work out, might not work out, but the fact is that just having
[01:00:24.460 --> 01:00:28.260]   that vast audience is not a, not a purgender of anything.
[01:00:28.260 --> 01:00:31.020]   You're still responsible for selling your own product.
[01:00:31.020 --> 01:00:33.020]   Right.
[01:00:33.020 --> 01:00:35.540]   True, true.
[01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:40.140]   We asked last week, I asked last week, "Should Apple take a victory lap?"
[01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:44.420]   And I still think Apple should take the victory.
[01:00:44.420 --> 01:00:45.420]   Huh?
[01:00:45.420 --> 01:00:47.020]   Steve Jobs is like Rips off his shirt.
[01:00:47.020 --> 01:00:48.020]   Rips off his shirt.
[01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:49.020]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:50.660]   He's won the World Cup is his.
[01:00:50.660 --> 01:00:52.660]   And guess what?
[01:00:52.660 --> 01:00:56.860]   Apple, I think, did in fact take a victory lap this week with their new iPad ad.
[01:00:56.860 --> 01:00:59.900]   Let's just take a little look at this.
[01:00:59.900 --> 01:01:05.100]   Oh, let me get the sound up so you can hear it because the audio is nicely done.
[01:01:05.100 --> 01:01:07.340]   Peter Coyote, by the way, reading this.
[01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:10.220]   This is what we believe.
[01:01:10.220 --> 01:01:13.300]   Technology alone is not enough.
[01:01:13.300 --> 01:01:18.380]   Faster, thinner, lighter.
[01:01:18.380 --> 01:01:20.380]   Those are all good things.
[01:01:20.380 --> 01:01:26.060]   But when technology gets out of the way, everything becomes more delightful.
[01:01:26.060 --> 01:01:27.820]   Even magical.
[01:01:27.820 --> 01:01:30.100]   That's when you leap forward.
[01:01:30.100 --> 01:01:35.980]   That's when you end up with something like this.
[01:01:35.980 --> 01:01:39.020]   They don't even need to say what this is.
[01:01:39.020 --> 01:01:45.940]   I think they should have a five second or ten second radio spot that simply says, "Your
[01:01:45.940 --> 01:01:47.660]   mother is dying of a terminal disease.
[01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:51.140]   Do you want your doctor to be using an iPad or an Android?
[01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:52.540]   Yeah, that would do it.
[01:01:52.540 --> 01:01:54.580]   The Apple logo.
[01:01:54.580 --> 01:01:55.580]   That would do it.
[01:01:55.580 --> 01:01:57.380]   I mean, this is clearly a victory lap.
[01:01:57.380 --> 01:01:59.700]   Magical revolutionary.
[01:01:59.700 --> 01:02:01.100]   We changed the world.
[01:02:01.100 --> 01:02:04.500]   Steve Wozniak said something that today, this week that I have been saying since I saw
[01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:11.900]   the first iPad a year ago January, which is that this was the computer Apple was founded
[01:02:11.900 --> 01:02:13.900]   to build the computer for the rest of us.
[01:02:13.900 --> 01:02:15.340]   And I think that that's the victory lap.
[01:02:15.340 --> 01:02:16.660]   You just saw the victory lap.
[01:02:16.660 --> 01:02:17.620]   Yeah.
[01:02:17.620 --> 01:02:20.660]   I first realized that about a year ago.
[01:02:20.660 --> 01:02:25.540]   Once again, I had my iPad, my Bluetooth keyboard at the pizza place with Wi-Fi.
[01:02:25.540 --> 01:02:27.060]   And suddenly, I just looked at it.
[01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:32.100]   And for the first time, I saw a Mac 128, or at least the device that the original Mac
[01:02:32.100 --> 01:02:37.060]   development team would have loved to have built, the sub $1,000 computer that you can
[01:02:37.060 --> 01:02:40.980]   take anywhere and you will take anywhere that does anything you want to do and just goes
[01:02:40.980 --> 01:02:41.980]   invisible.
[01:02:41.980 --> 01:02:42.980]   Yeah.
[01:02:42.980 --> 01:02:43.980]   The banana junior.
[01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:45.740]   Yes, the banana junior.
[01:02:45.740 --> 01:02:50.260]   You just made a proposal for a great iPad stand that I definitely would buy those.
[01:02:50.260 --> 01:02:51.260]   Yes, yes.
[01:02:51.260 --> 01:02:52.260]   Those little opus.
[01:02:52.260 --> 01:02:53.260]   Oh, yeah.
[01:02:53.260 --> 01:02:54.260]   The arms.
[01:02:54.260 --> 01:02:57.620]   Oh, I do like that.
[01:02:57.620 --> 01:02:59.460]   Let's take a break.
[01:02:59.460 --> 01:03:00.460]   Yeah.
[01:03:00.460 --> 01:03:01.460]   What can you say?
[01:03:01.460 --> 01:03:03.220]   What can you say?
[01:03:03.220 --> 01:03:06.180]   Tablets says Woz are for normal people.
[01:03:06.180 --> 01:03:07.180]   Normals.
[01:03:07.180 --> 01:03:08.180]   The normals like it.
[01:03:08.180 --> 01:03:11.980]   It's not like Woz doesn't know what normal isn't anyway.
[01:03:11.980 --> 01:03:13.500]   Well, yeah, that's a question.
[01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:14.500]   But that's another.
[01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:15.500]   That's a question for another day.
[01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:19.740]   And that's the word of a man who rides a segue everywhere and pays for money from a
[01:03:19.740 --> 01:03:21.140]   gum to pad of $2 bills.
[01:03:21.140 --> 01:03:22.140]   Yeah.
[01:03:22.140 --> 01:03:28.740]   By the way, I found I was so pleased we interviewed Ray Kurzweil on Wednesday of last week.
[01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:34.260]   By the way, if you didn't hear that interview, great interview on triangulation, it's twig.tv/tri.
[01:03:34.260 --> 01:03:36.820]   And I pulled down his book, could you get that for me?
[01:03:36.820 --> 01:03:39.540]   The Singularity is near.
[01:03:39.540 --> 01:03:40.980]   I think it's that a fantastic voyage.
[01:03:40.980 --> 01:03:43.700]   It's on the right, right at the top there on the right, the black and bring me both
[01:03:43.700 --> 01:03:44.700]   them.
[01:03:44.700 --> 01:03:47.420]   And I found something in here that just kind of blew my mind.
[01:03:47.420 --> 01:03:50.620]   I guess I'd put this on the shelf a while ago.
[01:03:50.620 --> 01:03:52.260]   And thank you, Eileen.
[01:03:52.260 --> 01:03:54.260]   Look what I found.
[01:03:54.260 --> 01:03:56.300]   This is so cool.
[01:03:56.300 --> 01:04:01.660]   Two $2 bills still together.
[01:04:01.660 --> 01:04:02.660]   Autographed by Woz.
[01:04:02.660 --> 01:04:05.140]   Isn't that awesome?
[01:04:05.140 --> 01:04:07.860]   I feel like now I should do the victory lap here.
[01:04:07.860 --> 01:04:10.580]   I mean, this is so cool.
[01:04:10.580 --> 01:04:11.860]   They're autographed to somebody named Henry.
[01:04:11.860 --> 01:04:12.860]   I don't know who that is.
[01:04:12.860 --> 01:04:14.740]   Henry, I got it.
[01:04:14.740 --> 01:04:15.940]   No, that's my son.
[01:04:15.940 --> 01:04:16.940]   So isn't that nice?
[01:04:16.940 --> 01:04:18.500]   So I got to frame these.
[01:04:18.500 --> 01:04:21.100]   These are those $2 bills it was, hands out.
[01:04:21.100 --> 01:04:22.100]   He still does that.
[01:04:22.100 --> 01:04:23.100]   We did that.
[01:04:23.100 --> 01:04:24.940]   On the cruise, he had a sheaf of them.
[01:04:24.940 --> 01:04:27.180]   And he also, and I also somewhere have his metal card.
[01:04:27.180 --> 01:04:32.700]   He has a new metal card that you can still cut filet of filet mignon with.
[01:04:32.700 --> 01:04:34.180]   We're going to take a break.
[01:04:34.180 --> 01:04:35.180]   Adam angst is here.
[01:04:35.180 --> 01:04:36.180]   Andy and not co.
[01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:41.180]   We're talking about Macintosh iOS.
[01:04:41.180 --> 01:04:45.900]   The Sony president, was he the president of Sony who said that, yeah, they ordered our
[01:04:45.900 --> 01:04:48.060]   phone, the CEO.
[01:04:48.060 --> 01:04:51.700]   They ordered our phone for the iPhone five camera camera, rather.
[01:04:51.700 --> 01:04:55.220]   Yeah, you think so?
[01:04:55.220 --> 01:04:56.220]   I don't know.
[01:04:56.220 --> 01:04:57.220]   Who knows?
[01:04:57.220 --> 01:04:58.780]   It doesn't sound like he knew from the quote.
[01:04:58.780 --> 01:05:02.700]   I mean, he's like, they think we think they use some chips or something.
[01:05:02.700 --> 01:05:03.860]   It's the weirdest thing.
[01:05:03.860 --> 01:05:09.020]   The last person that I trust with the news as a source for rumor is a CEO because either
[01:05:09.020 --> 01:05:12.740]   they're smart enough to know that they can't talk about this yet, or they honestly don't
[01:05:12.740 --> 01:05:15.500]   know what's going on underneath them, but their CEO.
[01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:18.700]   So they feel as though they can talk about things that they heard on a whiteboard.
[01:05:18.700 --> 01:05:21.460]   They saw on a whiteboard that someone said that they're thinking about doing at some
[01:05:21.460 --> 01:05:25.620]   point in the future that possibly if things work out, we'll be running out the flagpole
[01:05:25.620 --> 01:05:27.300]   and see if the duck solutions.
[01:05:27.300 --> 01:05:32.940]   He was talking, he was talking about Mossberg, and he was talking about the earthquake in
[01:05:32.940 --> 01:05:33.940]   Sendai.
[01:05:33.940 --> 01:05:36.100]   It's Howard Stringer.
[01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:41.820]   And he said that their camera image sensor facility in Sendai was affected by the tsunami.
[01:05:41.820 --> 01:05:46.380]   He said something to the effect of our best sensor technology is English is built on one
[01:05:46.380 --> 01:05:47.380]   of the tsunami.
[01:05:47.380 --> 01:05:50.580]   I have to tell you what the accident is because I know people go, what the hell are you saying?
[01:05:50.580 --> 01:05:54.860]   Our best sensor technology is built on one of the tsunami affected factories.
[01:05:54.860 --> 01:05:58.420]   Those go to Apple for their iPhones or iPads.
[01:05:58.420 --> 01:06:03.460]   Isn't that something they buy our best sensors from us?
[01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:04.460]   That's it.
[01:06:04.460 --> 01:06:05.460]   That's the quote.
[01:06:05.460 --> 01:06:06.460]   Who knows?
[01:06:06.460 --> 01:06:07.460]   Who knows?
[01:06:07.460 --> 01:06:15.260]   I have that English accent in my head because I've been listening to, oh, what a wonderful
[01:06:15.260 --> 01:06:19.660]   novel by sci-fi novel by Peter F. Hamilton called The Dreaming Void.
[01:06:19.660 --> 01:06:23.740]   Both Steve Gibson and Brian Brushwood told me I should listen to this on Audible.
[01:06:23.740 --> 01:06:26.980]   And the reader has such a posh English accent.
[01:06:26.980 --> 01:06:28.940]   Now, you know how that, does it ever happen to you, Andy?
[01:06:28.940 --> 01:06:33.100]   You'll be listening to a book and you start talking like the guy who read Dangerously
[01:06:33.100 --> 01:06:34.380]   Funny, The Smothers Brothers book.
[01:06:34.380 --> 01:06:38.380]   You kind of talk like this and not in for a while, I was talking like.
[01:06:38.380 --> 01:06:42.540]   Yeah, it's part of the fun of Audible is that they always have a wide range of voice
[01:06:42.540 --> 01:06:43.540]   factors.
[01:06:43.540 --> 01:06:44.540]   I like that.
[01:06:44.540 --> 01:06:47.500]   But with The Smothers Brothers book, I have to admit that I almost bailed after the first
[01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:51.660]   10 minutes because it took me a while to get used to that voice because it wasn't really
[01:06:51.660 --> 01:06:52.660]   you sound like that.
[01:06:52.660 --> 01:06:53.660]   You're supposed to be comedic.
[01:06:53.660 --> 01:06:54.660]   Yeah.
[01:06:54.660 --> 01:06:59.460]   It's like, oh, dear, never, never have a former writer talk about a ball, dear.
[01:06:59.460 --> 01:07:00.460]   Was that the writer?
[01:07:00.460 --> 01:07:01.460]   It was no.
[01:07:01.460 --> 01:07:02.460]   I wasn't David being cool.
[01:07:02.460 --> 01:07:03.460]   He sounds pretty good.
[01:07:03.460 --> 01:07:04.460]   Exactly.
[01:07:04.460 --> 01:07:07.660]   He's the, he's, he's, he's the, you break the guest host on fresh air.
[01:07:07.660 --> 01:07:09.500]   Yeah, he is a good, David being cool.
[01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:13.100]   This is a Johnny Heller narrated Dangerously Funny.
[01:07:13.100 --> 01:07:14.100]   This is his voice.
[01:07:14.100 --> 01:07:16.860]   Just so you know what we're talking about.
[01:07:16.860 --> 01:07:19.780]   In addition, they never fail to find steady work in nightclubs.
[01:07:19.780 --> 01:07:20.780]   Yeah.
[01:07:20.780 --> 01:07:24.700]   They sound a little bit like droopy dog, but, but he was, but you know what?
[01:07:24.700 --> 01:07:26.580]   He did like Harry Belafonte's voice.
[01:07:26.580 --> 01:07:29.060]   It was actually, it was kind of fun, but let me play it.
[01:07:29.060 --> 01:07:33.580]   I got to play the dreaming void because this guy, I love his accent.
[01:07:33.580 --> 01:07:38.660]   And it's funny how you get, you know, people actually start following audible readers and
[01:07:38.660 --> 01:07:42.660]   will get all the books that they read, not the books that they want to hear.
[01:07:42.660 --> 01:07:43.660]   So this is John Lee.
[01:07:43.660 --> 01:07:44.660]   Voice groupies.
[01:07:44.660 --> 01:07:48.300]   I have to say I'm an voice groupie at John Lee from now on any books that he does.
[01:07:48.300 --> 01:07:50.740]   I'm listening to him because he's for them.
[01:07:50.740 --> 01:07:56.540]   Centurion stations growth and age could be measured loosely in the same way as any humble
[01:07:56.540 --> 01:07:57.540]   terrestrial tree.
[01:07:57.540 --> 01:07:58.540]   He's such a good reader.
[01:07:58.540 --> 01:08:02.060]   He's a good reader in rings that had been added to over the centuries.
[01:08:02.060 --> 01:08:06.500]   By the way, excellent book, but I'm going to let Andy and I have a book and let's slip
[01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:07.500]   the dogs of war.
[01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:10.500]   I'm going to let him think of a double firm.
[01:08:10.500 --> 01:08:15.220]   I'll pay a half half of the cap and make an event.
[01:08:15.220 --> 01:08:16.220]   Do you ever do that?
[01:08:16.220 --> 01:08:17.860]   You ever go into Starbucks and talk like that?
[01:08:17.860 --> 01:08:20.140]   No, because I don't know how to order coffee.
[01:08:20.140 --> 01:08:23.180]   You did that quite well, actually.
[01:08:23.180 --> 01:08:24.180]   You're learning.
[01:08:24.180 --> 01:08:27.180]   So what is your, what are you reading these days on audible?
[01:08:27.180 --> 01:08:28.660]   I'm reading now.
[01:08:28.660 --> 01:08:33.860]   This was an interesting pick for me because I was really interested in the subject matter
[01:08:33.860 --> 01:08:35.500]   of Bobby Fisher.
[01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:36.500]   Yes.
[01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:37.500]   Really.
[01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:38.500]   That was a chess player.
[01:08:38.500 --> 01:08:40.260]   That was a chess player at that time.
[01:08:40.260 --> 01:08:44.420]   The tagline on his life is that he was a genius at chess but knew practically nothing
[01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:45.420]   about anything else.
[01:08:45.420 --> 01:08:50.380]   He basically turned his entire formative years into learning nothing but chess, which meant
[01:08:50.380 --> 01:08:53.260]   that he learned nothing about other people.
[01:08:53.260 --> 01:08:54.260]   Yeah.
[01:08:54.260 --> 01:08:55.980]   Very common, by the way, I must say.
[01:08:55.980 --> 01:08:56.980]   Yeah.
[01:08:56.980 --> 01:09:00.940]   I mean, it's this, I really think of the first 18 years of your life, the whole point is
[01:09:00.940 --> 01:09:05.180]   to build an operating system for interacting with other people because that's what the
[01:09:05.180 --> 01:09:09.580]   solution for every other problem is going to be about, about figuring out how the humans
[01:09:09.580 --> 01:09:13.140]   work and basically finding that connection between you and those other people.
[01:09:13.140 --> 01:09:15.580]   Because he never did that.
[01:09:15.580 --> 01:09:18.020]   It's a, it's, so I have two different books.
[01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:22.540]   They're two different, really, really cool books about Bobby Fisher that came over the
[01:09:22.540 --> 01:09:24.380]   past three or four months.
[01:09:24.380 --> 01:09:30.700]   And I'm going to give listeners an option here that if you are interested in an exciting
[01:09:30.700 --> 01:09:36.300]   story about all of the behind the scenes intrigues between governments and personalities
[01:09:36.300 --> 01:09:44.180]   and old fashioned chess hegemony that went into the legendary match between Fisher and
[01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:51.420]   Spaske, the most spaske Bobby Fisher, which was happened in 1972 when the Cold War was
[01:09:51.420 --> 01:09:55.460]   at its most elegant and its most frustrating and its most violent, where it seems as though
[01:09:55.460 --> 01:10:01.220]   both of these, both of these countries decided to take out all of their post moon landing
[01:10:01.220 --> 01:10:08.140]   frustrations and various organ waving things and make this that either the USSR is going
[01:10:08.140 --> 01:10:10.940]   to be the greatest country in the world or the US is going to be the greatest country
[01:10:10.940 --> 01:10:11.940]   in the world.
[01:10:11.940 --> 01:10:15.780]   There's a, there's a really wonderful book about that match called Bobby Fisher Goes to
[01:10:15.780 --> 01:10:19.620]   War, How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match.
[01:10:19.620 --> 01:10:21.020]   Oh, interesting.
[01:10:21.020 --> 01:10:28.300]   It's by David Edmonds and John Ednaue, read by Sam Soussou, I don't know his name, and
[01:10:28.300 --> 01:10:29.500]   it really focuses on that.
[01:10:29.500 --> 01:10:31.420]   I actually bought both of these books.
[01:10:31.420 --> 01:10:37.540]   I liked Bobby Fisher Goes to War because the other book is called Endgame, Bobby Fisher's
[01:10:37.540 --> 01:10:42.300]   remarkable rise and follow from America's brightest prodigy to the edge of madness by
[01:10:42.300 --> 01:10:43.300]   Frank Brady.
[01:10:43.300 --> 01:10:48.660]   This was more recent and it, of course, it talks about that match, but it is a full biography
[01:10:48.660 --> 01:10:53.740]   of Fisher by a man who's been writing biographies of Fishers since the 60s.
[01:10:53.740 --> 01:10:54.740]   Oh, interesting.
[01:10:54.740 --> 01:10:56.300]   Such a more and more novel.
[01:10:56.300 --> 01:10:57.700]   So it tells the entire story.
[01:10:57.700 --> 01:11:02.780]   Now, the reason why I offer both of these books is I'm going to, if you want that story
[01:11:02.780 --> 01:11:07.660]   about the match and the excitement and the intrigue and the personalities, go for that
[01:11:07.660 --> 01:11:08.660]   one.
[01:11:08.660 --> 01:11:15.620]   Now, if you are okay with a book that will leave you feeling very, very sad.
[01:11:15.620 --> 01:11:17.380]   Oh, no.
[01:11:17.380 --> 01:11:21.060]   I feel as though you have learned something fundamental about how you would like to raise
[01:11:21.060 --> 01:11:25.260]   your kids, especially if your kids seem as though they're being very, very smart.
[01:11:25.260 --> 01:11:27.260]   Don't do this.
[01:11:27.260 --> 01:11:32.100]   Because Bobby Fisher's had a very, very his own endgame.
[01:11:32.100 --> 01:11:33.660]   He did not end well.
[01:11:33.660 --> 01:11:34.660]   Yeah.
[01:11:34.660 --> 01:11:35.660]   Yeah.
[01:11:35.660 --> 01:11:41.620]   He seemed to have some serious problems going on and absolutely inability to relate to anybody
[01:11:41.620 --> 01:11:42.620]   or anything.
[01:11:42.620 --> 01:11:48.060]   I was a chess player at the time during this whole thing and a very serious tournament
[01:11:48.060 --> 01:11:50.980]   chess player and followed this very closely.
[01:11:50.980 --> 01:11:58.420]   And it's not unusual for the greatest chess masters to get a little less.
[01:11:58.420 --> 01:12:01.900]   I don't know if it's because they think so hard or I think your thesis is probably accurate
[01:12:01.900 --> 01:12:06.020]   that in order to become a great chess master, they have to give up everything, everything
[01:12:06.020 --> 01:12:07.020]   else in their lives.
[01:12:07.020 --> 01:12:08.020]   Yeah.
[01:12:08.020 --> 01:12:09.020]   Yeah.
[01:12:09.020 --> 01:12:10.220]   It's a larger lesson.
[01:12:10.220 --> 01:12:11.220]   It does.
[01:12:11.220 --> 01:12:12.220]   You'll leave you sad.
[01:12:12.220 --> 01:12:18.140]   I think that after two or three days when the color comes back to your face, you'll sort
[01:12:18.140 --> 01:12:21.420]   of realize that there's a lesson here that is not enough to be.
[01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:26.300]   It's not enough to be that passionate and that focused and that knowing that much about
[01:12:26.300 --> 01:12:31.180]   a certain subject, that you will get much, much farther if you simply understand the
[01:12:31.180 --> 01:12:34.580]   person at the other side of that chessboard in all areas of life.
[01:12:34.580 --> 01:12:35.580]   Yeah.
[01:12:35.580 --> 01:12:36.580]   I'm with you.
[01:12:36.580 --> 01:12:38.980]   I cannot wait to read both these books.
[01:12:38.980 --> 01:12:45.020]   So endgame, Bobby Fisher's remarkable rise in fall is the one that will depress you.
[01:12:45.020 --> 01:12:49.620]   If you're interested in the politics of this, which were fascinating, I mean Spassky's side
[01:12:49.620 --> 01:12:53.220]   claimed that the Americans were using secret weapons.
[01:12:53.220 --> 01:12:55.020]   Fisher said no Spassky spying on me.
[01:12:55.020 --> 01:12:57.060]   I mean, it was an amazing story.
[01:12:57.060 --> 01:13:00.540]   Bobby Fisher goes to war.
[01:13:00.540 --> 01:13:05.860]   The Fisher Spassky matches in the '70s, early '70s were spectacular events.
[01:13:05.860 --> 01:13:07.020]   And the whole world was watching.
[01:13:07.020 --> 01:13:09.380]   Unless you were alive, then you probably don't remember this.
[01:13:09.380 --> 01:13:11.580]   But this was a big, big story.
[01:13:11.580 --> 01:13:12.580]   It was fascinating.
[01:13:12.580 --> 01:13:13.580]   Yeah.
[01:13:13.580 --> 01:13:14.580]   I understand this.
[01:13:14.580 --> 01:13:17.420]   It's been option for a movie that's currently shooting and it's going to be available at
[01:13:17.420 --> 01:13:18.420]   release in 2013.
[01:13:18.420 --> 01:13:21.220]   And I can believe after finishing this book, I can believe it.
[01:13:21.220 --> 01:13:22.220]   Oh, it's amazing.
[01:13:22.220 --> 01:13:23.220]   It's exciting.
[01:13:23.220 --> 01:13:27.260]   It's one of those great books where you had really no interest in this level of player,
[01:13:27.260 --> 01:13:29.260]   this event or this sort of thing.
[01:13:29.260 --> 01:13:32.020]   But by the time you're midway through it, you've already figured out in your mind who
[01:13:32.020 --> 01:13:34.460]   you're rooting for, who you want to be thwarted.
[01:13:34.460 --> 01:13:36.500]   Spassky was a very nice man, actually.
[01:13:36.500 --> 01:13:37.500]   Yeah.
[01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:39.180]   But he was working for the Soviets.
[01:13:39.180 --> 01:13:43.140]   The interesting thing is Bobby Fisher ended his life just a few years ago in Iceland.
[01:13:43.140 --> 01:13:44.140]   He went back.
[01:13:44.140 --> 01:13:46.180]   It was the only country that would have him.
[01:13:46.180 --> 01:13:47.180]   Yeah.
[01:13:47.180 --> 01:13:50.140]   Still beloved in Iceland because that's where the match was in 1972.
[01:13:50.140 --> 01:13:52.100]   He brought a lot of attention to Iceland.
[01:13:52.100 --> 01:13:56.180]   And so of all the countries in the world, there were very few he could choose from anymore.
[01:13:56.180 --> 01:13:58.100]   Iceland is where he ended up.
[01:13:58.100 --> 01:13:59.780]   Wow, it's just a...
[01:13:59.780 --> 01:14:00.780]   Thank you, Andy.
[01:14:00.780 --> 01:14:02.700]   A couple of great recommendations.
[01:14:02.700 --> 01:14:04.540]   Now here's the problem.
[01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:05.980]   You got to choose.
[01:14:05.980 --> 01:14:06.980]   There are...
[01:14:06.980 --> 01:14:08.540]   This is the thing.
[01:14:08.540 --> 01:14:13.180]   If nothing else, Andy's illustrated the depth of choices on Audible.com.
[01:14:13.180 --> 01:14:14.180]   Not one, but two.
[01:14:14.180 --> 01:14:17.420]   In fact, there's actually more books about Bobby Fisher at Audible.com.
[01:14:17.420 --> 01:14:20.980]   So it really is like going to an amazing bookstore.
[01:14:20.980 --> 01:14:25.300]   But with one difference, it's full of audiobooks.
[01:14:25.300 --> 01:14:30.260]   And I got to tell you, if you haven't listened to audiobooks before, this is the time.
[01:14:30.260 --> 01:14:32.780]   You know, Game of Thrones is coming to HBO.
[01:14:32.780 --> 01:14:38.580]   There's a health of the version of Game of Thrones on Audible is fantastic.
[01:14:38.580 --> 01:14:44.380]   They do always have a list of books that are being made in the movies currently.
[01:14:44.380 --> 01:14:46.420]   So it's a great way to see some great stuff.
[01:14:46.420 --> 01:14:48.020]   Here's one about Tina Fey.
[01:14:48.020 --> 01:14:49.020]   I get...
[01:14:49.020 --> 01:14:50.900]   Oh, you know, I mean, I just...
[01:14:50.900 --> 01:14:52.180]   This is the problem.
[01:14:52.180 --> 01:14:53.780]   How do you choose just one?
[01:14:53.780 --> 01:14:55.100]   Well, pick one.
[01:14:55.100 --> 01:14:56.300]   Your first one's free.
[01:14:56.300 --> 01:14:57.740]   I know you're going to want more.
[01:14:57.740 --> 01:15:00.380]   Go to Audible.com/MacBreak.
[01:15:00.380 --> 01:15:04.140]   You'll be signing up for the Gold account, which is a book a month.
[01:15:04.140 --> 01:15:05.140]   That's plenty.
[01:15:05.140 --> 01:15:06.780]   It's least for starters.
[01:15:06.780 --> 01:15:09.220]   I listened to several months now.
[01:15:09.220 --> 01:15:10.860]   I just love Audible.
[01:15:10.860 --> 01:15:12.300]   But start with one a month.
[01:15:12.300 --> 01:15:14.420]   We don't expect you to go hog-wild.
[01:15:14.420 --> 01:15:15.420]   Your first book is free.
[01:15:15.420 --> 01:15:16.420]   Your first month is free.
[01:15:16.420 --> 01:15:18.540]   And you can cancel at any time and keep that book forever.
[01:15:18.540 --> 01:15:23.340]   So, you know, there's no risk for you, but do yourself a favor.
[01:15:23.340 --> 01:15:26.260]   Every week, we recommend great books on Audible.
[01:15:26.260 --> 01:15:29.420]   Many of the show, you know, Paul Therat's a huge Audible fan and he's a huge Audible
[01:15:29.420 --> 01:15:30.420]   fan.
[01:15:30.420 --> 01:15:31.420]   I am...
[01:15:31.420 --> 01:15:34.500]   I think almost all of the people who work at Twit by now have become fans of Audible.
[01:15:34.500 --> 01:15:38.300]   So, we always have some great recommendations.
[01:15:38.300 --> 01:15:39.700]   You want to read along with us?
[01:15:39.700 --> 01:15:41.940]   Go to Audible.com/MacBreak.
[01:15:41.940 --> 01:15:42.940]   You will.
[01:15:42.940 --> 01:15:43.940]   You can thank me later.
[01:15:43.940 --> 01:15:46.940]   I get a lot of people.
[01:15:46.940 --> 01:15:48.940]   Thank me for Audible.
[01:15:48.940 --> 01:15:53.700]   And it really is something, you know, you can read in the gym, in the car.
[01:15:53.700 --> 01:15:55.020]   When you're doing the dishes, I always...
[01:15:55.020 --> 01:15:56.020]   I had Audible last night.
[01:15:56.020 --> 01:15:57.660]   I was so into the Dreaming Void.
[01:15:57.660 --> 01:15:58.660]   I couldn't...
[01:15:58.660 --> 01:15:59.660]   Like I said, no.
[01:15:59.660 --> 01:16:03.460]   And I set up my Sonos speaker system so I could listen while I was cooking dinner while
[01:16:03.460 --> 01:16:05.460]   I was doing the dishes.
[01:16:05.460 --> 01:16:09.540]   It's like, I don't need to watch TV because I am seeing this play out, you know, on the
[01:16:09.540 --> 01:16:10.540]   screen of my mind.
[01:16:10.540 --> 01:16:12.300]   It's just so good.
[01:16:12.300 --> 01:16:15.060]   Audible.com/MacBreak.
[01:16:15.060 --> 01:16:17.780]   We thank them for their support of all of our Twit shows.
[01:16:17.780 --> 01:16:21.300]   And now, let's start with our guest.
[01:16:21.300 --> 01:16:22.540]   The guest of Honor, Adam Aix.
[01:16:22.540 --> 01:16:25.300]   I bet it's hard for you to choose just one thing to recommend.
[01:16:25.300 --> 01:16:28.300]   You know, always.
[01:16:28.300 --> 01:16:30.220]   There's cool stuff out there.
[01:16:30.220 --> 01:16:35.420]   So one cool thing that I want to recommend, just because partly because it's ours, but
[01:16:35.420 --> 01:16:40.660]   partly because it's brand new and actually covering the iPad and iPad 2, we have Jeff
[01:16:40.660 --> 01:16:46.060]   Carlson's Take Control of Media on your iPad ebook.
[01:16:46.060 --> 01:16:47.300]   And I got it up here on the iPad.
[01:16:47.300 --> 01:16:48.300]   They can't see anything other than that.
[01:16:48.300 --> 01:16:50.460]   Adam's Take Control series is so good.
[01:16:50.460 --> 01:16:52.300]   Highly recommended.
[01:16:52.300 --> 01:16:58.660]   And Jeff Carlson did a fabulous job of getting this book updated for iOS 4.3 and the iPad
[01:16:58.660 --> 01:16:59.820]   2.
[01:16:59.820 --> 01:17:05.340]   So it's got stuff on how to use the new camera and just, you know, the latest versions of
[01:17:05.340 --> 01:17:06.340]   everything.
[01:17:06.340 --> 01:17:11.340]   So really nice when you can get an ebook out there, you know, weeks after the thing ships.
[01:17:11.340 --> 01:17:13.060]   So that's thing number one.
[01:17:13.060 --> 01:17:15.740]   You can go to TakeControlBooks.com to find that.
[01:17:15.740 --> 01:17:22.540]   And then the second thing I'd like to recommend is actually a Firefox add-on.
[01:17:22.540 --> 01:17:25.300]   And Firefox 4 just shipped recently.
[01:17:25.300 --> 01:17:32.620]   And one of the things they changed is they took out a feature that was in Firefox 3.6.
[01:17:32.620 --> 01:17:36.100]   And it was something called Google's Browse By Name feature.
[01:17:36.100 --> 01:17:42.100]   So if you typed in the location bar, say you typed the two words White House because you
[01:17:42.100 --> 01:17:46.780]   want to go and learn about, you know, what's going on in the White House right now.
[01:17:46.780 --> 01:17:50.860]   Google's Browse By Name feature would actually do, basically, do a search on that and say,
[01:17:50.860 --> 01:17:56.860]   well, if anyone's searching on White House, they really mean www.WhiteHouse.gov.
[01:17:56.860 --> 01:17:58.100]   And I'll take you there directly.
[01:17:58.100 --> 01:18:02.820]   It's not quite like I'm feeling lucky, which Google also has.
[01:18:02.820 --> 01:18:06.220]   And it's not doing just the domain edition.
[01:18:06.220 --> 01:18:09.660]   So if you type Apple, it's going to take it Apple.com, but it's not doing that because
[01:18:09.660 --> 01:18:11.380]   it's just adding.com.
[01:18:11.380 --> 01:18:13.860]   So it's smarter than just adding the domain.
[01:18:13.860 --> 01:18:16.540]   Is this hit by Asun of Gary?
[01:18:16.540 --> 01:18:17.540]   That is indeed it.
[01:18:17.540 --> 01:18:20.540]   And it works with Firefox 4.
[01:18:20.540 --> 01:18:21.540]   Yes.
[01:18:21.540 --> 01:18:24.580]   And there's a way of doing this manual.
[01:18:24.580 --> 01:18:27.900]   You don't need the add-on, but it's certainly easier to recommend the add-on than going
[01:18:27.900 --> 01:18:32.020]   in and about config and messing with the key world you were all with a specific URL and
[01:18:32.020 --> 01:18:33.700]   everything like that.
[01:18:33.700 --> 01:18:36.380]   But it brings that back to Firefox 4.
[01:18:36.380 --> 01:18:41.340]   So if you were using Firefox and liked Browse By Name and sudden are like Firefox and you
[01:18:41.340 --> 01:18:45.420]   use them by by name and then you switch to Firefox 4 and don't have it, well, I have
[01:18:45.420 --> 01:18:49.020]   to tell you, through me for a loop, so I was very happy to find that I could add the feature
[01:18:49.020 --> 01:18:50.020]   back.
[01:18:50.020 --> 01:18:51.020]   It's funny.
[01:18:51.020 --> 01:18:52.380]   I mentioned this just the other week.
[01:18:52.380 --> 01:18:56.340]   When we visited Google's lobby some time ago, they have a screen in one of the buildings
[01:18:56.340 --> 01:18:58.420]   that shows all of Google searches as they're going by.
[01:18:58.420 --> 01:19:00.860]   And one of the top searches was for Yahoo.
[01:19:00.860 --> 01:19:02.780]   I thought that's weird.
[01:19:02.780 --> 01:19:06.500]   And the Google guy said, "Well, actually, what we find is most people don't type in
[01:19:06.500 --> 01:19:07.660]   URLs anymore.
[01:19:07.660 --> 01:19:11.700]   They'll type in the name of the site, Yahoo.
[01:19:11.700 --> 01:19:15.740]   Click search, then they'll get the list of Google results, and then they'll click Yahoo."
[01:19:15.740 --> 01:19:17.860]   So this simplifies that, takes one step out of it.
[01:19:17.860 --> 01:19:19.500]   You type Yahoo, you go to Yahoo.
[01:19:19.500 --> 01:19:20.500]   Yeah.
[01:19:20.500 --> 01:19:23.180]   No, you don't have to see the Google search results much quicker.
[01:19:23.180 --> 01:19:26.060]   And actually, it turns out there's a way of adding this to Chrome as well.
[01:19:26.060 --> 01:19:28.860]   That's something that actually is the main reason why I wasn't using Chrome was that I
[01:19:28.860 --> 01:19:30.460]   didn't have that feature.
[01:19:30.460 --> 01:19:34.420]   And actually, honestly, the main reason why I don't use Safari, that I Safari type in
[01:19:34.420 --> 01:19:37.060]   the address bar and it kind of tells you, "Ooh, that's not a domain."
[01:19:37.060 --> 01:19:38.060]   Now it's not a domain.
[01:19:38.060 --> 01:19:39.060]   Do a search.
[01:19:39.060 --> 01:19:40.060]   Yeah.
[01:19:40.060 --> 01:19:41.860]   So how do I do it in Chrome?
[01:19:41.860 --> 01:19:45.260]   Because that's actually something I wouldn't like to do.
[01:19:45.260 --> 01:19:46.660]   Chrome is a little trickier.
[01:19:46.660 --> 01:19:48.780]   You have to-- I have to go back and look.
[01:19:48.780 --> 01:19:50.780]   I found an article on the web that explains it.
[01:19:50.780 --> 01:19:51.780]   Oh, look.
[01:19:51.780 --> 01:19:52.780]   Okay.
[01:19:52.780 --> 01:19:55.340]   I'll put a write something in tidbits actually maybe later today because I need to up for
[01:19:55.340 --> 01:19:56.340]   someone too.
[01:19:56.340 --> 01:19:57.340]   T-I-D-B-I-T-S.com.
[01:19:57.340 --> 01:20:00.340]   If you subscribe now, you'll get it later in the day.
[01:20:00.340 --> 01:20:01.900]   Thank you, Adam.
[01:20:01.900 --> 01:20:02.900]   That's great.
[01:20:02.900 --> 01:20:04.340]   Andy, you're not co.
[01:20:04.340 --> 01:20:06.180]   You're pick of the week.
[01:20:06.180 --> 01:20:10.300]   My pick of the week is something that I'm sure a lot of our listeners are already familiar
[01:20:10.300 --> 01:20:14.460]   with but it's something that I shied away from for years and years and years.
[01:20:14.460 --> 01:20:18.740]   It is a hard shell form-fitting case for your MacBook.
[01:20:18.740 --> 01:20:22.380]   And I recently got a brand new MacBook Pro and this is the first time that I decided that
[01:20:22.380 --> 01:20:24.780]   I definitely want to put a case around it.
[01:20:24.780 --> 01:20:26.580]   And this is not obviously not a bag.
[01:20:26.580 --> 01:20:31.660]   We're talking about something that is really, really tightly, tightly engineered plastic
[01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:36.740]   shells that clip onto the front screen part and to the bottom part that essentially make
[01:20:36.740 --> 01:20:42.940]   this silver aluminum thing look like it's been dipped in Hello Kitty's bathwater.
[01:20:42.940 --> 01:20:45.980]   So you get them all kinds of colors.
[01:20:45.980 --> 01:20:50.940]   You can get them in pink, red, blue, red, purple, depending on where you get them from.
[01:20:50.940 --> 01:20:53.500]   The one that I got is the is from in case.
[01:20:53.500 --> 01:21:00.060]   If you go to go in case.com, you can get them for your 13 inch or 15 inch and in a range
[01:21:00.060 --> 01:21:01.060]   of colors.
[01:21:01.060 --> 01:21:06.540]   So I shied away from them at first chiefly because I didn't like the idea of taking something
[01:21:06.540 --> 01:21:11.660]   beautiful like this and putting this bunch of sort of like shaky sort of flimsy plastic
[01:21:11.660 --> 01:21:13.900]   shells that might kind of fall off.
[01:21:13.900 --> 01:21:18.580]   But that's been fixed very, very nicely over the past three or four years when these things
[01:21:18.580 --> 01:21:20.580]   have been made from various manufacturers.
[01:21:20.580 --> 01:21:25.340]   They clip on and boy it they fit so closely that it looks like they're factory made material.
[01:21:25.340 --> 01:21:28.260]   It wasn't until I started meeting lots of other people who happened to have them on
[01:21:28.260 --> 01:21:32.740]   their MacBooks that I was very, very impressed with how tightly these things hold on.
[01:21:32.740 --> 01:21:39.340]   The other part of it, two other components is that they will keep after I do carry my
[01:21:39.340 --> 01:21:43.340]   MacBooks everywhere and they are my daily driver machine.
[01:21:43.340 --> 01:21:48.500]   And so after I used my my current machine for about two and a half, three years and by
[01:21:48.500 --> 01:21:51.580]   the time it got replaced, it was all scratched up, baffed up.
[01:21:51.580 --> 01:21:53.260]   It wasn't looking very pretty.
[01:21:53.260 --> 01:21:57.500]   Obviously these new cases will keep it looking pretty in case in two years of time when you
[01:21:57.500 --> 01:22:01.460]   replace it with a new machine, you want to see if you can get with a $500, $600 bucks
[01:22:01.460 --> 01:22:03.380]   for an eBay, it'll look nice and pretty.
[01:22:03.380 --> 01:22:08.780]   But for me, the big deal is that every single time I go through airport security, I'm always
[01:22:08.780 --> 01:22:13.140]   a little bit on edge because I've spotted somebody a little bit ahead of me or behind
[01:22:13.140 --> 01:22:18.340]   me who also had a 15 inch MacBook Pro and how careful and cautious is he or she going
[01:22:18.340 --> 01:22:23.500]   to be to make sure that he got, they got their MacBook out and not mine.
[01:22:23.500 --> 01:22:27.500]   And before I used to do, I used to make a little put stickers on it and maybe we put
[01:22:27.500 --> 01:22:30.060]   little signs on it just to differentiate them a little bit.
[01:22:30.060 --> 01:22:35.060]   But I know that this is the only deep purple MacBook Pro that's probably going to be in
[01:22:35.060 --> 01:22:36.060]   that line.
[01:22:36.060 --> 01:22:41.300]   And also has a side benefit in that the end case I like because not only is it well ventilated,
[01:22:41.300 --> 01:22:46.140]   so it's not going to cause your machine to overheat, but also the texture of this case
[01:22:46.140 --> 01:22:48.740]   is slightly rubberized and slightly grippy.
[01:22:48.740 --> 01:22:49.740]   Oh, I like that.
[01:22:49.740 --> 01:22:51.980]   Yeah, because the specs are slippery.
[01:22:51.980 --> 01:22:52.980]   They're exactly.
[01:22:52.980 --> 01:22:53.980]   Yeah.
[01:22:53.980 --> 01:22:57.540]   So obviously you're tired to be careful with your $2000 computer, but there's a time when
[01:22:57.540 --> 01:23:01.900]   you're trying to get it inside the laptop bag and it's kind of skewed a little bit.
[01:23:01.900 --> 01:23:04.900]   This is not going to slip out of your hand and drop straight to the floor, which is
[01:23:04.900 --> 01:23:06.980]   something that has never ever happened to me, not even once.
[01:23:06.980 --> 01:23:11.260]   And if someone ever said that it happened, they're damn damn well.
[01:23:11.260 --> 01:23:12.580]   These cases are only about 50 bucks.
[01:23:12.580 --> 01:23:15.140]   I feel as though it's definitely short on Asia.
[01:23:15.140 --> 01:23:17.100]   It's a worthwhile investment for me.
[01:23:17.100 --> 01:23:20.700]   Does it come in colors or is it just black and white or what is it?
[01:23:20.700 --> 01:23:26.140]   The NKs comes in six colors, black, white, clear, this clear hole.
[01:23:26.140 --> 01:23:31.860]   Yeah, the cool thing about clear is that you might kind of like to customize your machine
[01:23:31.860 --> 01:23:32.860]   side.
[01:23:32.860 --> 01:23:33.860]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:23:33.860 --> 01:23:38.660]   I used to like to, with little of number one, I wound up taking the entire, the PowerBook
[01:23:38.660 --> 01:23:39.660]   100.
[01:23:39.660 --> 01:23:43.900]   I wound up taking the entire thing apart, painting every single part of it and really cool, like
[01:23:43.900 --> 01:23:45.100]   impact plastic colors.
[01:23:45.100 --> 01:23:49.340]   I got pressed on, I got really nice Roman transfer letters and it looked awesome for
[01:23:49.340 --> 01:23:52.420]   the first two weeks, been starting to scratch it up and sort of bealy.
[01:23:52.420 --> 01:23:54.580]   And the same thing happens when you put stickers on it.
[01:23:54.580 --> 01:23:58.540]   If you buy yourself a clear case, you can put all the stickers on it you want.
[01:23:58.540 --> 01:24:02.260]   You can actually put photos of your kids between the edge of the case and the actual machine
[01:24:02.260 --> 01:24:07.060]   itself knowing that at any point in the future, you can actually remove it.
[01:24:07.060 --> 01:24:11.260]   One tip, if you get different kids, you know, just say, yeah, you get new kids, you can
[01:24:11.260 --> 01:24:12.260]   just put different pictures in there.
[01:24:12.260 --> 01:24:15.060]   When you go from family A to family B.
[01:24:15.060 --> 01:24:17.060]   Yeah, that's so awkward.
[01:24:17.060 --> 01:24:18.060]   Forget.
[01:24:18.060 --> 01:24:20.860]   The stories about the businessmen who have maintained two families.
[01:24:20.860 --> 01:24:22.460]   Yeah, I've never understood that.
[01:24:22.460 --> 01:24:23.940]   Why would you, I mean, one's tough enough.
[01:24:23.940 --> 01:24:25.940]   I don't know why you want more than one.
[01:24:25.940 --> 01:24:30.460]   No, there's a, there is a, there was a great movie with Alec Guinness called The Captains
[01:24:30.460 --> 01:24:31.460]   Dilemma or something like that.
[01:24:31.460 --> 01:24:34.540]   He was a, he was a captain, he'd sail back and forth across the English channel.
[01:24:34.540 --> 01:24:38.500]   He had a wife in France and a wife in England and he had a little picture by his bed that
[01:24:38.500 --> 01:24:40.940]   he'd just flip around when he was going the other direction.
[01:24:40.940 --> 01:24:42.500]   So this, you could do that.
[01:24:42.500 --> 01:24:43.500]   Yeah.
[01:24:43.500 --> 01:24:44.500]   Yeah.
[01:24:44.500 --> 01:24:45.500]   There you go.
[01:24:45.500 --> 01:24:46.500]   There's a, that's a pink one, if you want to pink.
[01:24:46.500 --> 01:24:47.500]   Yes.
[01:24:47.500 --> 01:24:48.500]   It's a nice case.
[01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:49.500]   It's translucent.
[01:24:49.500 --> 01:24:51.660]   So the, of course your apple logo will go through it.
[01:24:51.660 --> 01:24:54.940]   I know that's important to a lot of people that these people see that they have an apple.
[01:24:54.940 --> 01:24:56.260]   It's not just a Dell.
[01:24:56.260 --> 01:24:58.980]   And about $50.
[01:24:58.980 --> 01:25:00.140]   Thank you, Andy.
[01:25:00.140 --> 01:25:06.620]   I want to put a little plug in for a product that I've started to use pretty religiously
[01:25:06.620 --> 01:25:07.620]   now.
[01:25:07.620 --> 01:25:09.820]   I, you know, quick silver, actually quick silver might be back.
[01:25:09.820 --> 01:25:11.660]   I noticed that the, it went open source.
[01:25:11.660 --> 01:25:15.180]   You know, Alcor went to Google, wrote the Google search bar, which isn't really quick
[01:25:15.180 --> 01:25:17.340]   silver, kind of abandoned the project.
[01:25:17.340 --> 01:25:19.900]   Others have taken it on and there's a new quick silver website.
[01:25:19.900 --> 01:25:21.100]   I'm not holding my breath.
[01:25:21.100 --> 01:25:23.220]   I was looking for a replacement.
[01:25:23.220 --> 01:25:27.380]   Nothing quite like quick silver, but I did find something that is now getting really close.
[01:25:27.380 --> 01:25:28.700]   It's called Alfred.
[01:25:28.700 --> 01:25:32.260]   You got to like the little bowl or hat that you get in the menu bar with Alfred.
[01:25:32.260 --> 01:25:33.780]   It is one of, it's a launcher.
[01:25:33.780 --> 01:25:37.460]   Now, the nice thing about Alfred is the basic Alfred is free.
[01:25:37.460 --> 01:25:40.980]   You know, you press command space and you get the launch bar and you can like, you know,
[01:25:40.980 --> 01:25:44.180]   you can launch Skype or whatever by typing the first few letters.
[01:25:44.180 --> 01:25:48.340]   It'll let you do other things too with the first few letters, especially if you spend
[01:25:48.340 --> 01:25:50.220]   a little money on the power pack.
[01:25:50.220 --> 01:25:53.580]   Now, I decided when I saw this, I said, I'm going to give them as much money as they
[01:25:53.580 --> 01:25:54.580]   want.
[01:25:54.580 --> 01:25:58.460]   I bought the full $30 power pack, but it starts at 12 pounds.
[01:25:58.460 --> 01:25:59.620]   It's a British company.
[01:25:59.620 --> 01:26:05.460]   The power pack adds the ability to navigate file systems, which is very cool.
[01:26:05.460 --> 01:26:10.700]   By starting your, your Alfred search with a slash, you can actually go through your file
[01:26:10.700 --> 01:26:17.380]   system, you can move documents very easily to folders from your desktop that way.
[01:26:17.380 --> 01:26:19.500]   You can have searches built into it.
[01:26:19.500 --> 01:26:23.100]   In fact, there are a couple of websites now that have point, you know, you just click
[01:26:23.100 --> 01:26:25.700]   a button and it adds a search to Alfred.
[01:26:25.700 --> 01:26:29.420]   There's a little mini player for iTunes in there.
[01:26:29.420 --> 01:26:33.380]   Clipboard history is another feature that I really put me over the top, the ability to
[01:26:33.380 --> 01:26:38.100]   save all your clipboard stuff and get right back to it anytime you want.
[01:26:38.100 --> 01:26:39.860]   It's just fantastic.
[01:26:39.860 --> 01:26:43.860]   Your address book is actually in there, recent documents.
[01:26:43.860 --> 01:26:44.860]   You can theme it.
[01:26:44.860 --> 01:26:49.340]   You can send an email by just typing email and a name and it'll pop it up.
[01:26:49.340 --> 01:26:52.380]   This was actually important to me, not maybe not for everybody, but the ability to type
[01:26:52.380 --> 01:26:57.300]   terminal commands by just simply starting with a single key press.
[01:26:57.300 --> 01:27:02.380]   In my case, I use the greater than symbol and I can add a to do list to my to do.text
[01:27:02.380 --> 01:27:06.900]   and so forth, just with a simple terminal command, or I can do who is built into the
[01:27:06.900 --> 01:27:07.900]   terminal.
[01:27:07.900 --> 01:27:09.660]   I like the ability to do terminal commands directly.
[01:27:09.660 --> 01:27:14.420]   So he's got an API coming along, third party app integration.
[01:27:14.420 --> 01:27:18.220]   The developer really seems to be putting his heart and soul into this and I'm glad because
[01:27:18.220 --> 01:27:22.140]   I think we needed a really good launcher to replace Quicksilver and this is my vote.
[01:27:22.140 --> 01:27:23.140]   There are other ones.
[01:27:23.140 --> 01:27:24.340]   Launch bar people love launch bar.
[01:27:24.340 --> 01:27:25.580]   It's very powerful.
[01:27:25.580 --> 01:27:31.780]   This one's free to get started and I think that I have to a little tip of the hat to the
[01:27:31.780 --> 01:27:36.780]   author for making this free and then the power pack, if you need those additional features,
[01:27:36.780 --> 01:27:42.500]   he also blogs and talks a lot about what he's up to on his blog, Alfred A.L.F.R.E.D.
[01:27:42.500 --> 01:27:46.860]   after Alfred the Butler and Batman, I would guess.
[01:27:46.860 --> 01:27:50.740]   Have either of you used that or do you I bet you I know Andy, we talked to you before you
[01:27:50.740 --> 01:27:53.140]   said I don't use anything like that.
[01:27:53.140 --> 01:27:54.140]   What nothing?
[01:27:54.140 --> 01:27:58.860]   Well, only because I already use spotlight for just type of few letters and launch the
[01:27:58.860 --> 01:27:59.940]   app.
[01:27:59.940 --> 01:28:06.060]   My problem is that if the those those those utilities work incredibly great, you can get
[01:28:06.060 --> 01:28:07.700]   really, really fast with them.
[01:28:07.700 --> 01:28:12.180]   But the second you move on to a machine that does not have that installed, you are host
[01:28:12.180 --> 01:28:15.220]   because you don't have those high performance enhancements.
[01:28:15.220 --> 01:28:19.340]   Also you just don't want to get used to something better in case you can't use it.
[01:28:19.340 --> 01:28:23.660]   It's that and plus it's the time that I have to spend adapting the way that I use my Mac
[01:28:23.660 --> 01:28:27.140]   so that I instinctively go to that launch bar.
[01:28:27.140 --> 01:28:31.780]   I have to be honest with myself and say that at the end of the day goodness you saved almost
[01:28:31.780 --> 01:28:33.900]   33 minutes by using this launch bar.
[01:28:33.900 --> 01:28:36.380]   Yeah, but I probably going to waste that time anyway.
[01:28:36.380 --> 01:28:38.460]   So that's one of the neat things that Alfred does for you.
[01:28:38.460 --> 01:28:43.700]   It actually will tell you how much you've used Alfred and how much time you've saved.
[01:28:43.700 --> 01:28:47.940]   And that's kind of fun, but of course completely useless, but a nice little feature.
[01:28:47.940 --> 01:28:51.580]   That's the reason why I often will buy share where I don't really need.
[01:28:51.580 --> 01:28:54.540]   I just want to give this person money.
[01:28:54.540 --> 01:28:57.740]   These guys, you know, it's a husband and wife team.
[01:28:57.740 --> 01:29:01.100]   He I'm going to try to find his name because he's just really great.
[01:29:01.100 --> 01:29:05.980]   I follow them both on Twitter and they have a just you know, I got an email because I
[01:29:05.980 --> 01:29:09.100]   send him the I send him the full the largest amount of money I could because I just want
[01:29:09.100 --> 01:29:14.540]   to support him and I got an email thanking me and and saying, you know, we appreciate
[01:29:14.540 --> 01:29:15.900]   your support and so forth, which I like.
[01:29:15.900 --> 01:29:16.900]   These are real personal feel to it.
[01:29:16.900 --> 01:29:17.900]   What do you use Adam?
[01:29:17.900 --> 01:29:18.900]   You use it's over launch bar.
[01:29:18.900 --> 01:29:20.460]   I'm a big launch bar fan.
[01:29:20.460 --> 01:29:26.420]   I've been using launch bar since it was the only one available of this type and just,
[01:29:26.420 --> 01:29:28.900]   you know, all the others I've tried them at different times.
[01:29:28.900 --> 01:29:33.100]   There's nothing wrong with them, but they've never quite clicked for me that there's something
[01:29:33.100 --> 01:29:36.020]   about, you know, you get you get used to you get used to it.
[01:29:36.020 --> 01:29:43.980]   And when I find interesting, I'm a really big fan of being able to type at my computer.
[01:29:43.980 --> 01:29:48.180]   And that's why I was talking about the browse by name feature in Firefox because I think
[01:29:48.180 --> 01:29:50.620]   about and I don't want to do a search from launch bar.
[01:29:50.620 --> 01:29:55.700]   For instance, I somehow always go to go to to Firefox and you know, and he'll will hit
[01:29:55.700 --> 01:30:00.020]   command L and then type into the address bar, but it's saying I'm just typing stuff.
[01:30:00.020 --> 01:30:01.020]   That's how I think.
[01:30:01.020 --> 01:30:02.980]   I think in words.
[01:30:02.980 --> 01:30:07.820]   And so what I think in characters and so for me, all of these kinds of things are really
[01:30:07.820 --> 01:30:12.020]   a big, big advantage rather than having to kind of look visually for something.
[01:30:12.020 --> 01:30:13.300]   I'm not a graphics guy.
[01:30:13.300 --> 01:30:16.260]   I'm not a I'm not a visual visual thinker.
[01:30:16.260 --> 01:30:17.540]   Yeah, I'm the same way.
[01:30:17.540 --> 01:30:18.900]   I don't want to take my hand off the keyboard.
[01:30:18.900 --> 01:30:22.820]   I want to just kind of type, type, type, type, type and the even mousing around in the
[01:30:22.820 --> 01:30:24.780]   file system is a pain in the butt.
[01:30:24.780 --> 01:30:28.980]   So that's why this solves that issue with all gooey's have of having to drill through folders.
[01:30:28.980 --> 01:30:29.980]   No one wants to do that.
[01:30:29.980 --> 01:30:30.980]   So you type what you want.
[01:30:30.980 --> 01:30:33.780]   And Alfred's I think Alfred's gotten pretty darn good.
[01:30:33.780 --> 01:30:35.180]   I use launch bar for a long time.
[01:30:35.180 --> 01:30:36.180]   I love Dan.
[01:30:36.180 --> 01:30:37.980]   Of course, he's a great guy.
[01:30:37.980 --> 01:30:38.980]   Quick silver.
[01:30:38.980 --> 01:30:44.780]   Love that amazing power tool that people like Merlin man have shown me, you know, how amazing
[01:30:44.780 --> 01:30:45.780]   it is.
[01:30:45.780 --> 01:30:47.780]   But Alfred is is an up and comer.
[01:30:47.780 --> 01:30:50.620]   Andrew Pepperell, his wife, Firo, well done.
[01:30:50.620 --> 01:30:52.220]   Alfred app.com.
[01:30:52.220 --> 01:30:54.620]   And it is in the app store, probably the best way to buy.
[01:30:54.620 --> 01:30:55.620]   Oh, actually not.
[01:30:55.620 --> 01:30:59.940]   Here's the ampere you get the problem with the store because they don't allow in app
[01:30:59.940 --> 01:31:01.100]   purchases.
[01:31:01.100 --> 01:31:04.900]   If you want to buy the power pack, it still works, but you have to download it from the
[01:31:04.900 --> 01:31:08.580]   Alfred site so that you could put the power packing because they don't because Apple doesn't
[01:31:08.580 --> 01:31:10.980]   currently allow in app purchases.
[01:31:10.980 --> 01:31:13.220]   So if you want to just try the free one, no problem.
[01:31:13.220 --> 01:31:14.820]   Try it from the app store.
[01:31:14.820 --> 01:31:17.900]   And then if you want to get the power pack, you'll have to go to the website to update
[01:31:17.900 --> 01:31:19.220]   it.
[01:31:19.220 --> 01:31:21.140]   I want to thank Adam and for joining us.
[01:31:21.140 --> 01:31:23.260]   Always a pleasure to have you Adam.
[01:31:23.260 --> 01:31:24.260]   Always fun to be here.
[01:31:24.260 --> 01:31:25.260]   Tedbits.com.
[01:31:25.260 --> 01:31:28.180]   What day of the week, Tuesday?
[01:31:28.180 --> 01:31:34.140]   We usually release the email issue on Monday nights so people mostly see it on Tuesday.
[01:31:34.140 --> 01:31:35.940]   But we're posting issues on the website.
[01:31:35.940 --> 01:31:41.660]   So via RSS feed shows up in Twitter shows up in Facebook shows up in our iOS app.
[01:31:41.660 --> 01:31:45.900]   So you know, you can get tidbits throughout the week as we put stuff up.
[01:31:45.900 --> 01:31:50.100]   Oh, you're poking at the April Fool's issue.
[01:31:50.100 --> 01:31:53.820]   We had to make sure to put that little gestures hat up there at the top for something.
[01:31:53.820 --> 01:31:54.820]   And then you're going to be able to do that.
[01:31:54.820 --> 01:31:55.820]   And then you're going to be able to do that.
