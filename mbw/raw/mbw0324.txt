[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.840]   I hope I'm okay, but I'm joined by Andy Anaco, Alex, Lindsey, and Renee Ritchie.
[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.440]   We're going to talk about the new iPad mini numbers and how we're supposed to interpret
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:16.440]   them.
[00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.240]   iPhone loyalty, perhaps dropping, is the force field down and Apple's possibly breaking
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.680]   up with Intel for ARM.
[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.120]   All that and more next.

[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.240]   Do not adjust your television screens.
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.640]   I am not Leo LePorte.
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.320]   I am Sarah Lane filling in for Leo LePorte because he is in Australia.
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.720]   He's about to, I don't think he's actually gotten on his cruise ship just yet, but he's
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.320]   going to be out for the next couple of weeks.
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.920]   So you're stuck with me, but not just me.
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.000]   Do not cry.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.560]   I have the best Mac Break Weekly panel the world has ever known, starting to my left.
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.520]   Andia Notko, but not just Andia Notko.
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:47.360]   It's Andia Notko, the senior lead writer of the Chicago sometimes technology columns,
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.200]   emeritus extraordinaire PhD.
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:58.240]   And to my right, we have Alex Lindsay, the senior lead best pixel core person ever.
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:07.560]   And to Alex's right is Renee Ritchie, the editor extreme ice cream loving person, emeritus.
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.800]   Yay of I'm more at i'more.com.
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:11.800]   Hi everybody.
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:12.800]   Hello everybody.
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.640]   How's it going?
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.200]   Electricity love it.
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.200]   Isn't it fast?
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.200]   Oh, electricity is wonderful.
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.200]   It's just the best.
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.760]   This is like the first time in the studio in like a month between travel and the hurricane.
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.000]   I have not set on a proper, proper seat in a proper studio.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   It's quite nice.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.880]   Now, Andy, were you, were you affected by the storm over on the East Coast at all with
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.280]   travel, as you're mentioning?
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.280]   Not so bad.
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.240]   I got happen to get home from North Dakota just two or three days before the storm hits.
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.240]   That wasn't a problem.
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.440]   We lost power for like four days, which was a problem.
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.680]   But when you again, we look at the video of what was happening in New Jersey and in Manhattan,
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.480]   it's like, okay, I can deal with four days of working and working in the Dunkin Donuts
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.400]   10 miles away and throwing out like maybe at best $30 or $40 for the first.
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.040]   I'm no reason to complain.
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.200]   Yeah, no, Renee, you're up in Montreal.
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.200]   Is that right?
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:11.200]   Now, did you get any of the storm as it worked its way sort of northwest from the eastern
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.200]   seaboard?
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.040]   No, it actually approached the wall that we have sort of like Game of Thrones and then
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.520]   it was turned away.
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:22.400]   It was either frozen or intimidated into making an abrupt left turn and all we got was a little
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.600]   bit of rain powered out for a half an hour or so and we were back up and frozen.
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:27.600]   Well, I'm glad.
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.640]   And Alex, you were at least during the storm time you were out on the West Coast.
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:31.960]   I just saw you here.
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.200]   So I'm like, where's Alex now?
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.200]   I just saw him here.
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.600]   He works in the same building as me.
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.720]   But you weren't actually traveling during that time, right?
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:39.720]   I was during the storm.
[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.160]   I was actually flying over New York.
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.160]   We'll be down on it from Turkey.
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.600]   How we were flying from Turkey to Los Angeles, but it's dandble.
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.520]   But you flew up and over itself.
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:51.520]   You didn't actually run for it.
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.520]   Unaffective.
[00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:53.520]   Yes, I missed it.
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:54.520]   But you're not in Turkey now.
[00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:55.520]   You're in Texas.
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:56.520]   I'm not.
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.520]   I mean, I'm in Texas.
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.160]   The Turkey, Texas, there's Turkey here, but there's no Turkish coffee.
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.960]   So I'm in Houston, Texas right now.
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.880]   Well, thanks to everybody for joining me on this episode of Mac Break.
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:14.640]   Obviously, there's a lot of Mac news, but I figured we might as well start with the iPad
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:20.560]   many news because people now have their iPads, at least those who pre-ordered in time or
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:27.080]   went and got them on the second, which was last Friday.
[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:33.480]   And I don't have mine because I ordered a LTE version, which we can get to why.
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:37.760]   I think that that's the way to go, but it's certainly not the way to go if I want to be
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.320]   excited and have my mini with me.
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:40.680]   But Renee, you're holding yours up.
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:41.680]   You've got a mini.
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:42.680]   Yes.
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.120]   I ordered like you the cellular version, but then I went and stood in line and bought a
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.520]   Wi-Fi version to tide me over until it arrived.
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:48.520]   You couldn't wait.
[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:49.800]   Well, we don't know when we're getting them.
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.560]   They say mid November, but I mean, it's we're getting close to mid November.
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.520]   And I don't even have any notice of when mine is shipping.
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:00.040]   Yeah, there was originally dates put onto a lot of them, including mine.
[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.680]   And then those dates sort of mysteriously disappeared a couple days later.
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.480]   But I have the excuse of having to review it in as timely a fashion as possible.
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.960]   At least that's what I tell myself when I look at the credit card bill.
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.360]   And Andy, you've got one too.
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.200]   I mean, I guess you have the same pretty good excuse.
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.800]   You've got to have it.
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.360]   Yeah, well, I mean, and I'm doing it too parter.
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.400]   Unfortunately, I got a little bit carried away with the second part of the review.
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.120]   So instead of being up on Monday, as I hope, it's going to be up like on Wednesday.
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.920]   But I mean, I couldn't be happy with them.
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:32.240]   Now that I have it, I mean, this ultra ultra high definition, like almost magazine quality
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.360]   display, it's nice and compact.
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.080]   I can fit into tiny, tiny pockets.
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.320]   It's cost $199.
[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:37.840]   Oh, wait.
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.080]   No, this is the Google Nexus 7.
[00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:40.080]   How embarrassing.
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.080]   I'm sorry.
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.920]   OK, but I also have an iPad mini.
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.360]   And I mean, the screen is not great, but it's not bad.
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.280]   And the price is 300.
[00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:49.280]   300.
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:50.280]   300.
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.080]   Sorry, but you caught me there.
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.080]   Yeah.
[00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.840]   So it's a very cool device.
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:02.320]   It's it's Apple like kind of gave us exactly what we asked for and not something else.
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:06.160]   The we've been saying wouldn't be great if there was an iPad that was small enough that
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.960]   we didn't have to necessarily carry it inside a laptop case.
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:15.200]   Wouldn't be great if there were an iPad that were a little less expensive and cost 500
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.200]   bucks.
[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:19.760]   And so Apple said, all right, we will take the iPad.
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:22.880]   We will scale it down to 80% of its size.
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.400]   We will sell it for $329.
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:25.400]   There you go.
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:26.400]   You should be happy now.
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:31.400]   Oh, I kind of thought that you'd like tweak it a little bit because this is a mini tablet.
[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:32.400]   It's not a full size tablet.
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:33.400]   You change.
[00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:34.400]   Nope, nope.
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.720]   Again, you said you wanted a smaller iPad.
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:37.840]   So that's what we did.
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:40.840]   We took all the apps and we simply shrunk them down 80%.
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:44.080]   Yeah, but you didn't make the button figure.
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:45.080]   Smaller iPad.
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.080]   You're welcome.
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.960]   The right word consumers is your welcome.
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:53.440]   Yeah, but I mean, you made a good point where you made the joke that it doesn't have a
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:58.540]   high def screen and you said the screen isn't bad, but it isn't great.
[00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:01.640]   And that not the sort of thing that Apple is known for.
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:04.800]   Apple's not supposed to be just okay.
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.400]   That's what really surprised me.
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.480]   It was a very it's a very linear logical.
[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:10.480]   Here is what we did.
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:11.840]   We shrunk it down 80%.
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:16.120]   And it's not a bad device, but it's not an exciting device.
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:20.440]   I'm not sure that's that's necessary for every Apple device to be exciting because even
[00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:25.080]   as is a device this size for $329 that runs the library of apps.
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:29.320]   It's available for the iPad is in itself a wonderful thing.
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:34.280]   It's just that it happens to live in a world in which $200 will give you a device that
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:37.720]   in many, it's there are two very different types of devices.
[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:40.480]   It's not like you can easily get one or the other.
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:42.080]   It depends on what you're what you're looking for.
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:46.320]   But for $103 less, you get a device that's a much better book reader.
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:48.440]   I mean, the display is much, much better.
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:52.920]   It has GPS built in, which means that you can preload your maps using the built in map
[00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:55.960]   app and still use it for navigation as you go about.
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:09:01.560]   Whereas unless you you pop for the for the LTE model, you're not getting GPS on this one,
[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:02.560]   either.
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:04.800]   So it's a complicated sort of decision tree to navigate.
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:10.200]   I really do think that on a on a fundamental level, the iPad mini is just as good as the
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.200]   Nexus 7.
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.440]   The Nexus 7 is just as good as the iPad mini.
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:14.840]   It depends on what you're buying it for.
[00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:16.000]   And that's really what it comes down to.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.560]   Renee, you've obviously had time to play with your Wi-Fi only mini.
[00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:22.560]   Do you agree with Andy?
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:27.560]   Do you think it's sort of what we were expecting, but a little lackluster?
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:32.120]   No, actually, I don't agree with Andy on this rare occurrence.
[00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:33.840]   The iPad mini, there's a couple of issues.
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:37.360]   One is that Apple is still bound by the laws of physics and economics.
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:42.240]   And you can't put a 20, 48 by 15, 36 display in a device that small.
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.480]   Otherwise, the iPad 3 and 4 would be that thin.
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.000]   You've got to light that panel.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.960]   You've got to power that panel.
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:51.120]   And you've got to get a price point where you can afford to put that panel in.
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:56.560]   So we're probably 12 to 18 months away from having that device.
[00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:02.280]   So this was absolutely a compromise, but it was a compromise that Apple thought on the
[00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:05.160]   sort on total would be a good one.
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:09.880]   And for example, I took it to my mom's place on Friday because she's my barometer for normal
[00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:10.880]   people.
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.960]   I think it's really important to remember that Apple has never made stuff for geeks.
[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:18.760]   We kind of adopt Apple stuff and we use it and we wish it did certain geekier things,
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:20.840]   but Apple is a mainstream company.
[00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:23.880]   And she's had an iPad 2 going on a year and something.
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:29.840]   And for her, the screen was a huge improvement because it went from the iPad 2's 132 pixels
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:33.880]   per inch to the iPhone 3GS' 163 pixels per inch.
[00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:36.400]   So to her, the text was clear, crisper than ever.
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:37.480]   It was lighter, thinner.
[00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:42.680]   And instead of going for an iPad 3 before or an iPad 4 now, she's absolutely getting an
[00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:46.640]   iPad mini yet because the choices that Apple made with these products are the things that
[00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:48.120]   she values as a consumer.
[00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:52.280]   Okay, but you're talking about someone who's already familiar with the iPad, they're already
[00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:53.280]   heavily invested in it.
[00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:58.120]   I do think that if you're already really big into Apple and very big at iPad, the advantages
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:02.000]   of sticking with that platform and being able to use all your same apps is a very, very
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   big win.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.080]   I'm also, I'm also suggesting that Apple was required to put a 300 DPI display into
[00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:09.240]   the mini that was really never going to happen.
[00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:13.320]   But the problem is that we're talking about a consumer level item that you're absolutely
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:18.080]   spot on that people who are in here, who are coming into the store to buy a mini tablet
[00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:20.720]   are not necessarily looking for a post PC device.
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:22.400]   They're looking for a device for reading books.
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:24.360]   They're looking for a device for watching movies.
[00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:28.160]   They want access to apps, but they don't necessarily need a quarter million of them
[00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:29.160]   out there.
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:34.800]   And when you put the last part of my review talks about the differences between the iPad
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:39.760]   mini and the Nexus 7 and the Kindle Fire HD, each of which excels at something that the
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:40.760]   other two do not.
[00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:44.640]   And you have to, we also have to talk about the Kindle Fire HD because this is the device
[00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:50.000]   that when you launch it, it doesn't confront you with a patchwork of application icons
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.280]   that don't mean much to the average person.
[00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:55.360]   It says here are the last three books you read.
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.000]   Behind that, here is the movie that you're watching.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.400]   And then there, behind that, there's the website you were looking at.
[00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:01.880]   Tap this nice big kaleidoscope.
[00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:06.920]   This nice big carousel and you will get exactly the content that you want in a very high definition
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:10.560]   display at a price point of $199.
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:15.360]   I did the same test that you did, putting these devices in front of people who are just, you
[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:18.000]   know, who are not dumb people and not unsophisticated people.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.200]   They're just not as interested in technology as we are.
[00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:25.200]   And they really tended to pick up and stay with the Kindle Fire a little bit longer than
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:27.120]   I expected them to.
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:28.720]   They recognized what the iPad is.
[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:34.840]   But when it comes to, I want to spend a not great amount of money on a device for getting
[00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:40.320]   access to my content, the Fire HD has a bunch of charms that are unique to the Fire HD.
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:44.760]   I don't think that the iPad mini is a failure by any stretch of the imagination.
[00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:48.680]   But we remember a year ago, when we started talking about this, we started talking about
[00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:52.840]   how, gosh, if Apple does this for $199, they will obliterate the competition.
[00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.960]   The competition will cease to exist.
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:59.640]   And if they sell for $249, then maybe these other devices can find a niche for themselves.
[00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:03.920]   I think that there is enough distinction between the three of them.
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:07.440]   There are enough profiles that are unique to each one of them that they excel over the
[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:08.440]   others.
[00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:13.600]   And there's enough price difference between $199 and $329 that it still is a completely
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:15.080]   wide open field.
[00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:21.400]   Alex, you're obviously familiar with the argument that, hey, once you go retina, you can't go
[00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:25.840]   back to something that's sort of like the iPad 2, but maybe a little bit smaller and therefore
[00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:26.840]   looks a little bit better.
[00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:27.840]   What do you make of all this?
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:29.480]   I don't know what would happen to be honest.
[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:30.480]   I'm not a big guy.
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:34.680]   I have to admit, which is kind of odd because I'm really into resolution and we do all
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:35.960]   this production and everything else.
[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:41.680]   But I have found both with my laptop and with my iPad, with the iPad 3, I've got a couple
[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:46.200]   of iPad 2s in my home office that I use for interfaces.
[00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:51.360]   And I don't really, it doesn't really bother me.
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:55.800]   The retina, going retina or not has not been a big issue for me.
[00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:59.240]   I, one way or the other, I think that it's fine.
[00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:00.440]   I haven't gotten the mini.
[00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:02.400]   I'm very much looking forward to the mini.
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:06.800]   And I think that one of the things that is obviously to Apple's advantage is a certain
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:11.480]   buy-in that I think is occurring with people who have iPhones already.
[00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:12.840]   They're already used to the iOS.
[00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:16.560]   They're not that interested in learning how to use another operating system.
[00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:21.120]   So I think that the mini can benefit a lot from those types of folks that don't need
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:27.200]   it to be as cheap as Android but weren't ready to spend $600 or $500 on it.
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.440]   So I think there's some turnover there.
[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:31.960]   I do think it makes it, again, easier for educational markets.
[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:41.120]   I know for us, we were holding off for the mini, for the iPad mini, to use, to proliferate
[00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:46.560]   through a bunch of our systems where we're using them for live streaming just to manage
[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:48.960]   things, people staying in communication and everything else.
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:54.480]   I was a little hesitant to spend $500 or $600 on every unit to do that because we have
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:56.480]   to buy a bunch of them.
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:59.120]   And $329 makes a lot more sense to me.
[00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:03.880]   So I think that those are the decisions people are making to purchase those.
[00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:05.960]   I don't think that they're cleanly.
[00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:11.760]   Does this compete directly for $1 per pound per pound with the Nexus?
[00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:12.760]   Which I think is great.
[00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:13.920]   I have a Nexus as well that I'm using.
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:20.280]   I don't have the nook or the Kindle Fire, but in those comparisons, I think that you
[00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:23.720]   have people who have bought into the iPhone, you have companies that already are using
[00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:24.720]   iPads.
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:25.720]   They just want to expand it.
[00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:27.720]   You have schools that I think are going to look at these.
[00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:33.720]   I still think that the iPad currently is probably the best solution from a tablet perspective
[00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:34.720]   for schools.
[00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:39.320]   Primarily, I think because of being able to lock them down more effectively than some
[00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:40.840]   of the other options.
[00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:44.400]   And I think that's important from a school administration perspective, whether we think
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:48.240]   they should or not, I think that's a priority for them.
[00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:57.200]   I'm coming from the -- I don't have any other competing tablets because iOS and OS X really
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:59.840]   are my only operating systems that I'm using regularly.
[00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:05.120]   But I certainly am comparing the mini to what I could get in the fourth gen iPad, for example.
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:08.240]   Fourth gen iPad looks just like my third gen iPad.
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:10.640]   It's just kind of faster.
[00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:16.560]   But the complaint that I hear from people and it sort of came out of nowhere is how heavy
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:17.560]   the iPad is.
[00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:21.200]   Oh, you know, the iPad, it's not really very mobile and it's so heavy, it's so hard to
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:22.200]   hold.
[00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:24.280]   It's like, nobody said that a month ago.
[00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:27.640]   All of a sudden, it's, you know, there are these horrible bricks that nobody wants to
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:28.640]   use anymore.
[00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:33.320]   I will say that I use my iPhone a lot more than I use my iPad.
[00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:37.280]   So I mean, I definitely find that, you know, for instance, I love Flipboard, but I probably
[00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:42.920]   spend 90% of my time using Flipboard on my iPhone, standing in a line somewhere where
[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:48.120]   I just feel -- I do feel like the iPad is probably more bulky than I want to take out.
[00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:51.920]   So I think that for me, I think there's a high probability that once my mini actually
[00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:57.720]   shows up, I got the LT as well as I'm waiting, that I probably will end up using that more
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:59.440]   often than the iPad.
[00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:02.680]   Yeah, that's actually one of the reasons I think LTE on the mini.
[00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:06.840]   If it really is so much more portable and just kind of easy to throw into whatever small
[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:11.200]   bag you might have laying around, then that's why LTE is key for me.
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:14.240]   But then again, I've always had an LTE iPad in general.
[00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:18.520]   When I noticed that people are worried about Wi-Fi in places that I don't even think about
[00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:19.880]   it, I think, oh, gosh, I'm so glad.
[00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:21.120]   Well, I didn't always have LTE.
[00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:23.640]   I always had data connectivity.
[00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:26.120]   That's what I'm looking forward to.
[00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:27.720]   But yes, who knows?
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:33.640]   We'll get the LTE iPad minis that we ordered hopefully sooner than later.
[00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:38.640]   But let's move on to who did buy the minis, at least the minis that are available now.
[00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:44.520]   Apple announced that it sold 3 million iPads in three days over opening weekend and clarified
[00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:51.960]   to those who said, well, wait a second, 3 million iPads across the entire line?
[00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:53.480]   No, no, Apple said, no, no, no.
[00:17:53.480 --> 00:18:00.560]   Just the Wi-Fi only mini models that are now available as of Friday and the fourth gen
[00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:04.400]   full size Retina iPad that was also available as of then.
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:09.400]   So this doesn't account for anybody who's already pre-ordered the LTE iPads, et cetera.
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:11.400]   But they didn't split out the numbers.
[00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:14.680]   They didn't say this is how many minis we sold and this is how many fourth gen's we
[00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:19.520]   sold, which is obviously something that people are really curious about.
[00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:22.680]   Renee, do you think that's because the mini didn't sell that well?
[00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:23.680]   What does this mean?
[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:28.160]   No, I mean, that was a really strange story that got covered about a week ago.
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:33.120]   We saw that Android is almost like Google is almost selling a million Nexus 7s a month
[00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:34.240]   and that got widespread.
[00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:35.560]   Hallelujah coverage.
[00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:40.440]   And then Apple announced 3 million iPad 4 and iPad mini Wi-Fi as that was sort of, oh,
[00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:41.440]   they're hiding something.
[00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:42.440]   It's strange.
[00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:45.320]   But Apple's behavior is very consistent.
[00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:50.920]   They announced actual units sold to actual customers, not stuff that is shipping, that
[00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:55.840]   is wanted by carriers that they imagine are one day wish that they will sell.
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:57.880]   And they were very clear which models it was.
[00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:59.440]   They very rarely break out.
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:04.040]   They don't tell you which 11 inch MacBook Air versus 13 inch MacBook Air they sell or
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:07.840]   which iPhone 4 versus iPhone 4s versus iPhone 5.
[00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:11.800]   They sell except for the opening weekend when there's only one product.
[00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:16.760]   So we might at the next sales call get a 50% mix of that was iPad mini, the way they do
[00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:19.000]   with the iPod touch in the iPod line.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.640]   But that's probably competitive information for them and it's probably information that
[00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:27.800]   we won't get in plain granular detail at any time.
[00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:31.360]   Anybody else think that it's Apple trying to hide numbers or is this just the way that
[00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:33.520]   we're going to see numbers rolled out in the future?
[00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:35.080]   This is how many iPads we sold.
[00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:37.520]   It was great quarter, that sort of thing.
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:41.400]   They usually do break end up breaking down some of that stuff in the future.
[00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:46.200]   But I think that they, they, I don't know if we've ever had two different products being
[00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:47.480]   released at the same time.
[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:48.480]   I think that's also it.
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:51.120]   And I, and I, you know, they're probably in a knee jerk.
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:55.040]   They want to be able to tell people what happened, but they also don't want to, they're trying
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:56.560]   to figure out what the hell they, how they want to spend it.
[00:19:56.560 --> 00:20:00.880]   I have a hard time believing that a majority of those would be iPad 4s.
[00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:06.240]   I mean, I think that it seems like the, the mini would be the obvious purchase, but maybe
[00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:07.240]   that's the problem.
[00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:10.840]   Maybe, maybe it was a whole lot of iPad 4s and not so, not so many minis.
[00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:16.200]   It was interesting on a, on launch day, of course, usually launch day starts at the Sydney
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:20.000]   store in Australia because it's sort of technically the first opening.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.880]   Let's see how many people are at the store.
[00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:28.680]   That'll, that'll set the tone for how the, the, the apple riots will be in stores as
[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:30.480]   the day moves on.
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:34.120]   And Reuters had a story that said, gosh, you know, there aren't really any people lined
[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:35.440]   up at these stores.
[00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:37.320]   The Hong Kong store was kind of dead.
[00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:43.240]   There were more staff members than there were, uh, eager consumers.
[00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:48.360]   But then it seemed like conflicting reports, particularly coming out of New York City,
[00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:54.520]   which was a very strange day, uh, for an iPad mini launch day, people said, now lands
[00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:58.200]   were around the block and they're not too far from the lines around the block for people
[00:20:58.200 --> 00:20:59.600]   who are trying to get water.
[00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:03.360]   It's interesting because, I mean, it was a strange launch.
[00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:06.680]   You didn't have the cellular versions available, which a lot of people want.
[00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:09.920]   So anybody who wanted those, uh, was not going to go line up.
[00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:13.760]   So pre-orders are increasingly taking away as much as people say apple likes the show
[00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:18.160]   and the crowds and the lineups, they're increasingly doing pre-orders and more and more of the
[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:21.960]   people that I know and people I used to line up with are now pre-ordering it.
[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:25.480]   There were about a hundred people at my local apple store for the iPhone five launch.
[00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:30.440]   There were about 20 people for the iPad mini launch, uh, and it was freezing cold.
[00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:34.040]   So I don't know if I'm ever going to line up in October for an apple launch again, but
[00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:38.160]   I think just the nature of how apple is handling their launches and especially when you have
[00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:42.480]   a product coming out in stages is not favorable for big lineups on launch day.
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:45.320]   Andy, were you a line-upper?
[00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:46.800]   Uh, I was not.
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:54.040]   Uh, it's, it's, I think it's been a long time since the release of a consumer product
[00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:56.840]   item is worth like camping out for.
[00:21:56.840 --> 00:22:00.840]   Uh, I mean, the early days, the first iPad, the first iPhone, even the second iPhone,
[00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:03.840]   it's fun to be in a line full of people who are excited enough about something that they
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:05.680]   would want to get, get in a line with it.
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:10.400]   But I would like to think that we can, it's time to get rid of that metric as a, as an
[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:12.000]   indication of success or failure.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:17.080]   Uh, I think it's a, it's a, I've been at apple stores who are swanning in as a member
[00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:18.080]   of the press.
[00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:22.680]   And so I was camping out for, for two days beforehand and seeing just hundreds and hundreds
[00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:26.680]   and hundreds of people who've been lined up there for five, six, seven, eight, nine hours
[00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:29.680]   to get their hands on this thing instead of waiting two weeks.
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:34.000]   And at that point, you know, that there's, there's your parents, like they just planted
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.560]   this thing inside the back of your head.
[00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:40.720]   And occasionally that part of your logic center goes to the fore and say, but you can get it
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:43.760]   for, for without having to, without having to stand in line.
[00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:47.080]   And just like, if you're willing to wait a week, maybe a, maybe a week and a half, you'll
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:48.520]   get it eventually.
[00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:53.920]   And you will not have had to like be unshaven and have no, have, have, have a filthy smelling
[00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:56.280]   mouth at eight a.m. and a suburban mall.
[00:22:56.280 --> 00:23:00.440]   And I, what, what, what is, what is this hole in your life, son, that you think you're
[00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:02.080]   trying to fill with this iPhone?
[00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:07.480]   Don't you rather fill it with, I don't know, joy of joy of life about goodness, about
[00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:10.040]   appreciation for one's fellow fellow humans?
[00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:14.320]   Is that your or you could be Samsung's next commercial, right?
[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:15.320]   Yeah.
[00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:18.600]   You just, you're the guy who walks up to the guy in line and says, don't you want your
[00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:21.520]   life to be just fuller and more joyous?
[00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:23.520]   Don't have to do this.
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:26.960]   It's like you can, you can, you can have, you can have that time of your life back.
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:29.360]   And you know, there, I'm sorry.
[00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:34.880]   I was about to put on the clerical call and play my beloved father Andy role.
[00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:40.040]   But yeah, I think it is a long time for us to realize that go to apple.com, place an
[00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:41.520]   order when it arrives.
[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:42.760]   You'll enjoy it.
[00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:44.640]   And you'll find that you survived just fine.
[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:49.120]   You know, the last time I participated, ooh, pardon me, phone ringing.
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:50.120]   That's the car dealership.
[00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:52.120]   Apparently my car is drivable again.
[00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:53.120]   Yay.
[00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:56.080]   But won't that be nice?
[00:23:56.080 --> 00:24:00.600]   The last time I actually participated in a official launch was when the iPhone came to
[00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:01.920]   Verizon.
[00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:05.280]   And so a twit, we thought, well, we probably sent Sarah down there.
[00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:10.360]   I went to the flagship store in downtown San Francisco and we were covering it.
[00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:12.640]   We were covering it live and nobody was there.
[00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:13.840]   There was nobody there.
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:15.640]   I mean, I was there first thing in the morning.
[00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:16.640]   Yes.
[00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:17.800]   But there wasn't a line.
[00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:19.280]   I was one of three people on the story.
[00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:20.280]   It was totally weird.
[00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:21.880]   It was kind of a bust actually.
[00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:25.960]   And we thought, I mean, is this indicative that people just don't care that they don't
[00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:27.840]   hate AT&T enough?
[00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:29.200]   And that's not true.
[00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:32.400]   No, it just wasn't the sort of thing that people needed to go into an Apple store to
[00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:33.400]   do.
[00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:34.400]   Yeah, you spread a bit of Verizon.
[00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:38.760]   And it's gone over the whole gamut because for a while there was there was a situation
[00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:42.240]   where there were these huge lines and it was the only way you're going to get it.
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:45.440]   And then there were a couple where you would just show up at nine o'clock at night the
[00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:49.400]   same day and all those lines were gone and there were plenty of phones.
[00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:52.520]   So you had this kind of situation where, you know, and I know I got out of the habit
[00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:53.520]   of it.
[00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:56.020]   'cause I'm still waiting for my iPhone 5.
[00:24:56.020 --> 00:25:02.640]   I would really love it if the improv everywhere group -
[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:04.960]   I just heard that there's going to be -
[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:07.000]   and this is legitimately exciting.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.780]   I was excited when I heard about this, Oreos.
[00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:13.180]   They're making gingerbread Oreos for the holiday season.
[00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:14.320]   And not every store has them.
[00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:18.480]   I think that improv America should get 400 people together
[00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:22.240]   who will do an iPhone-like, product-launch excitement,
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:24.540]   people lining up outside one store
[00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:25.520]   that will pick at random,
[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:28.600]   that they know is getting the gingerbread cookie,
[00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:30.160]   gingerbread version of Oreos.
[00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:31.920]   Just pick a random boring product,
[00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:33.840]   like a new eight-outlet power strip.
[00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:35.720]   You're all excited about the eight-hour power strip.
[00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:37.160]   So there are 400 people.
[00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:38.680]   There are carts with coffee
[00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:39.960]   because they're all talking about,
[00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:42.120]   is I have the seven-hour pop list strip.
[00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:45.120]   I can't believe that I waste my money on that.
[00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:46.080]   I can't believe we're finally getting
[00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:47.560]   an eight-outlet power strip.
[00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:50.120]   It does seem rather silly in the abstract, does it not?
[00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:55.960]   Well, we've talked a lot about the mini and the iPads
[00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:59.760]   and in general, just the iOS experience,
[00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:02.720]   as opposed to other tablet experiences
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:04.000]   that are very good.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.880]   And you also have the option of buying.
[00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:12.960]   Apple has dropped to 50.4% of the tablet market
[00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:15.560]   as of Q3, of course.
[00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:17.760]   And that's not a huge drop.
[00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:20.680]   I mean, they're certainly still extremely dominant,
[00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:25.680]   but a drop nonetheless, Samsung has shot up to 18.4%.
[00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:30.080]   Amazon, which introduced the Kindle Fire HD,
[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:32.880]   the new one back in June, I guess it was,
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:34.920]   has shot up to 9%.
[00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:37.680]   So Amazon, it's got a ways to go,
[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:41.480]   but definitely got a boost from the new fire.
[00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:42.760]   - Those are shipping numbers, right?
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:43.920]   Not sold numbers.
[00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:45.120]   - Correct, yes.
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:47.360]   Those are shipping numbers.
[00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:52.360]   So we've talked a lot about this on TNT earlier in the week,
[00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:55.160]   TechnoStay, of course, the Daily Tech show on Twitch,
[00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:56.280]   if you're not familiar with it.
[00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:57.680]   It's a really good show.
[00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:02.040]   And this all, this looks pretty standard to me.
[00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:05.480]   This also doesn't take into account iPad mini numbers,
[00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:07.000]   so the numbers are gonna change a little bit.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:11.840]   But it also doesn't mean that particularly Android tablets
[00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:13.760]   and a lot of the Windows tablets
[00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:15.560]   that may become extremely popular
[00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:17.480]   and we've got a holiday season to contend with,
[00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:19.760]   aren't going to skew the numbers that much more,
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:21.520]   but what does everybody think?
[00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:24.800]   Andy, do you see the overall Apple numbers continuing
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:28.880]   to fall as Android takes a large chunk
[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:30.640]   and Windows catches up?
[00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:34.480]   - That has to be the case.
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:36.040]   If only if you look at how the numbers
[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:37.560]   are being put together.
[00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:40.080]   One of the reasons for Samsung's really big jump
[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:43.200]   is that they're using the Galaxy Note
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:45.800]   and the Galaxy Note 2 and classifying them as tablets.
[00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:47.800]   And though they're kind of hybrid tablets,
[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:50.440]   you could, they're hybrid devices.
[00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:51.800]   You could classify it as a phone,
[00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:54.560]   you could classify it as a tablet, but okay, whatever.
[00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:57.360]   But now that so many Windows 8 devices
[00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:00.600]   are targeting tablets specifically, so many notebooks,
[00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:04.760]   they're form, they're major manufacturer classic notebook
[00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:07.360]   form factors, but which can be converted
[00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:10.120]   into something that is very similar to a tablet.
[00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:12.480]   If they decide to log those in as tablets as well
[00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:14.560]   for the purpose of analysis,
[00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:16.400]   then you're gonna see Apple's number declining.
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:18.280]   But that's just like phony, blown up,
[00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:19.760]   blowny playing of the numbers.
[00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:22.720]   I do think that it represents a change in,
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:26.000]   if it gives us some valuable information,
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.480]   it's that it's not true that the world was waiting
[00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:32.600]   specifically for the Apple iPad,
[00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:36.520]   that it is the great tablet, it is the great brand,
[00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:37.640]   it's the most recognizable brand,
[00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:41.080]   it has international sales, region and sales force.
[00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:43.120]   But I think the success of these other tablets
[00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:46.080]   is indicating that people are very, very much
[00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:48.680]   in favor of tablets in general.
[00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:52.160]   And so as more companies come up with more devices,
[00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:54.480]   we can get some more fine grained information
[00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:56.840]   about what consumers are responding to.
[00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:59.480]   I'm really interested to see what kind of numbers we get
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:01.360]   once the first Microsoft releases numbers
[00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:03.840]   on sales of the Surface RT tablet.
[00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:08.840]   That are they, if you give a consumer a blind taste test,
[00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:10.760]   and unfortunately, I know that's impossible,
[00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:12.520]   but if you gave them a blind taste test
[00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:16.320]   between a $500 tablet that is optimized for tablet use,
[00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:20.200]   or a $500 tablet that runs a familiar operating system
[00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:23.400]   and is designed to be used with keyboards and mouse as well,
[00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:25.800]   it's more of a crossover device.
[00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:27.680]   Which one are they going to prefer?
[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:29.880]   These are questions that I've been wondering about
[00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:31.240]   for the past two or three years.
[00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:32.600]   Again, the classic question,
[00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:35.640]   are they responding specifically to the Apple iPad?
[00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:37.600]   Did Apple design something that was exactly
[00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:38.960]   what people were wanting?
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:42.600]   Or is it such a success because it was the first device
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:45.520]   of its kind and they executed that idea exceptionally well?
[00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:48.000]   Is it the idea or this articulation of the idea?
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.240]   And that's what we're going to find out
[00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:50.680]   in the next quarter, I think.
[00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:53.240]   - Renee, do you agree?
[00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:56.640]   Is it kind of like how the iPhone was the trailblazer?
[00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:59.160]   And now there are lots of other options for somebody
[00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:01.440]   who doesn't think the iPhone is exactly the phone
[00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:03.680]   that they need and want?
[00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:04.800]   - Yeah, I agree, absolutely.
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:07.920]   With Andy and I think his assessment is spot on.
[00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:09.920]   I'm always careful when they're shipping numbers though
[00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:12.160]   because, and I don't want to kick the Blackberry playbook
[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:16.280]   when it's beyond down, but they had large shipping numbers.
[00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:18.440]   - You had a pretty deep order kick it.
[00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:21.240]   - Yeah, I got in trouble when I'm digging his deeps like Dan.
[00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:23.160]   But they had huge shipping numbers,
[00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:25.320]   then they had huge sitting on shelf numbers
[00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:26.760]   and huge return numbers.
[00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:28.480]   And the overall share at the end of the day
[00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:30.080]   didn't shake out to very much.
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:32.160]   And Samsung gets a lot of orders
[00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:34.320]   and they ship a lot of product.
[00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:36.880]   And they're not always as transparent as Apple
[00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:40.800]   as about actual number of devices put in a customer's hand.
[00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:42.800]   And the Galaxy Note counting it as a tablet
[00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:47.080]   when it's sold on carriers, subsidized the way a phone is.
[00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:49.640]   Again, it makes it really difficult to measure these things.
[00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:52.440]   But the Apple didn't really just make the iPad.
[00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:55.000]   They made the first mainstream computing appliance.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.360]   It's the same thing with the Apple II and the Mac.
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:58.560]   This was just the next iteration
[00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:01.200]   of Apple democratizing technology.
[00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:05.240]   And they are often first, but they are never alone in this.
[00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:06.680]   And now other companies,
[00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:09.320]   whether it's Amazon making a more media appliance
[00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:12.200]   or Microsoft making something that's in between the iPad
[00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:15.080]   and the MacBook Air, other companies will take their shots
[00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:16.760]   and some of those shots will be successful
[00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:19.200]   and they will find customers whose needs aren't served
[00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:24.040]   by the iPad and that share will kind of solidify itself.
[00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:26.120]   So I think the iPad for the foreseeable future
[00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:27.400]   will maintain a majority share,
[00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:29.720]   but I think there will be a good battle for number two
[00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:33.600]   and then a more of a diversified ecosystem going forward.
[00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:36.200]   - Well, I think as we start to see it build up,
[00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:38.960]   I think we're also going to be looking at usage.
[00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:41.360]   So it's one thing for a lot of people to have the phone.
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:43.080]   It's another thing of how they're actually using them.
[00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:47.000]   And this makes a big difference for the app developer
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.960]   for the ecosystem because as Apple's market share drops,
[00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:51.120]   of course, the danger really is,
[00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:53.400]   is that you have more and more developers picking other things
[00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:56.800]   to develop for rather than iOS.
[00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:59.520]   And that's of course what we grew up with
[00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:02.840]   as Mac users is being that niche
[00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:06.080]   and then got used to being in the majority.
[00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:10.320]   And we may actually be going back to a minority position,
[00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:13.160]   but the question really again, most stats
[00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:18.240]   that we see right now are heavily driven into the usage
[00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:20.960]   is very, very high with iPhones, much higher than Android
[00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:23.160]   'cause a lot of people are buying them as the other phone
[00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:25.200]   and they're not really, there's a lot of Android users
[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:26.200]   that aren't putting anything on the phone,
[00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:27.600]   they're just using whatever it came with.
[00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:30.200]   It's just a bigger version of what they were already using
[00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:33.800]   before and so I think that's also another piece
[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:35.960]   to continue to watch.
[00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:38.440]   But I do think that Apple is missing an opportunity
[00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:41.000]   by not producing a lower cost one.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.240]   I think most people who are buying tablets
[00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:46.000]   are still making that choice on cost.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.640]   And I think that Apple not having a 249 version,
[00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:54.040]   I think that was where they really missed the mark.
[00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:56.800]   - Especially since they didn't go retinat
[00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:58.520]   a lot of folks said, "Ah, they go retinat,"
[00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:01.920]   then it can justify something over $300, but they didn't.
[00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:03.560]   - No, I think that they didn't,
[00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:06.320]   they obviously decided to do what they do,
[00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:07.680]   which is hang on to their margins.
[00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:11.520]   And I think that this may be one of those points
[00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:13.400]   that people look back on,
[00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:15.560]   that Apple might have been better off
[00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:17.480]   taking a little bit less of a margin
[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:19.480]   and being a little bit more aggressive
[00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:22.080]   about protecting their turf.
[00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:24.120]   - I don't know really. - Apple conflict.
[00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:27.880]   - I don't know really, it's interesting.
[00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:30.680]   I don't know, I don't have any insight information
[00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:33.000]   about Apple's long range business planning.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.160]   But it is interesting in that,
[00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:38.360]   I could easily see a business plan for the iPad mini
[00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:39.520]   that goes like this.
[00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:42.480]   They know that as soon as they put a mini tablet out there,
[00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:44.520]   it's gonna sell like gangbusters.
[00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:45.480]   They're gonna sell through,
[00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:47.240]   they're gonna have no problem moving product,
[00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:49.640]   which is not a reason to produce an inferior product,
[00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:51.560]   but it's a good reason to put something out of the market.
[00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:53.280]   If people want it and they wanna pay for it,
[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:56.000]   go ahead and let them buy it today.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.800]   Knowing that maybe a year from now,
[00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:00.480]   the cost of certain components is gonna come down,
[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:02.640]   and then they will be able to finally sell
[00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:04.720]   that retina grade iPad mini
[00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:07.160]   and keep the exact same price point.
[00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:09.560]   And then a year from, remember how excited we were
[00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:13.520]   when we went from regular iPads to retina quality iPads.
[00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:15.040]   A lot of people that had devices
[00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:16.640]   that still certainly had another year or two
[00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:17.880]   worth of life in it.
[00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:20.240]   They decide, suddenly this is my backup,
[00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:21.880]   this is my beach iPad,
[00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:24.200]   'cause I need the retina display right now.
[00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:25.760]   So it's possible that they're really thinking about,
[00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:27.400]   they're thinking about a year in the future
[00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:30.880]   where that $329 price point will serve a lot of needs today.
[00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:33.680]   It will give them great margins for the first device.
[00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:35.160]   People are still gonna be very, very happy
[00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:36.160]   with the original iPad,
[00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:37.960]   because it gives people a mini tablet
[00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:39.160]   that they don't have yet,
[00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:42.480]   which is something with a real tablet infrastructure,
[00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:44.000]   a real tablet app store up there.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.600]   And then a year from now,
[00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:49.600]   there's enough bounce in the manufacturing costs
[00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:51.760]   that they can put a much better display,
[00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:53.320]   much better camera, much better this,
[00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:54.520]   much better that into it,
[00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:56.720]   and still hold the line at $329.
[00:34:56.720 --> 00:34:58.080]   The Apple does not like to raise,
[00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:00.720]   they don't like selling things that are inexpensive,
[00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:02.640]   but they don't like to raise prices either.
[00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:04.640]   So this might be part of their game plan.
[00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:05.880]   - There's a, I just think,
[00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:07.400]   - I think one, all I was gonna say,
[00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:08.800]   all I was gonna say is that I think the one issue is,
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:10.600]   is that the danger is, is that right now,
[00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:12.760]   a lot of people are making their decisions about tablets
[00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:14.240]   that we've gone from a tablet,
[00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:18.360]   a tablet being a, you know, kind of a out there thing
[00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:21.160]   that only the techies are using to really
[00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:24.240]   the replacement for the average person's computing.
[00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:25.240]   I mean, you know, I think that's,
[00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:26.560]   I mean, within the next two or three years,
[00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:27.760]   and so I think the problem is,
[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:30.360]   is that window now is that there's a lot of people
[00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:31.960]   out there trying to figure out what they're gonna get.
[00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:32.840]   And once they get it,
[00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:34.800]   I don't think that they're necessarily going to be
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:36.280]   buying something the next year.
[00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:37.840]   And I think that that's the, you know,
[00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:41.600]   and we can see a huge market shift over the next 18 months
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:43.800]   due to a lot of people making that decision,
[00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:45.280]   not just people, but corporations
[00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:47.160]   and educational organizations.
[00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:48.800]   - Renee, what are your last thoughts
[00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:50.480]   before we go to a break?
[00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:53.320]   - Yeah, so the Apple's always got these two sides
[00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:54.160]   of the coin.
[00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:55.560]   One is that they don't want to make the mistake they made
[00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:57.160]   with the Mac where they went for profit share
[00:35:57.160 --> 00:35:58.160]   instead of market share.
[00:35:58.160 --> 00:35:59.560]   Another thing is they don't want to make crap
[00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:01.920]   like a netbook and they say these things over and over again.
[00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:03.640]   And the way they've solved this traditionally
[00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:05.920]   and the way that I imagine they'll solve this now
[00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:07.440]   is that they're still tremendously
[00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:09.720]   supply constrained for the iPad Mini.
[00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:12.080]   They will sell everyone they can make this year.
[00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:14.720]   So selling it cheaper will just compound that problem.
[00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:17.560]   But if they have a 329 iPad Mini now,
[00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:19.920]   and then as Andy said, when the retina one comes down,
[00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:22.040]   the original iPad Mini drops $100
[00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:24.800]   and you have the good iPad Mini at the price they've established,
[00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:26.120]   you have last year's iPad Mini,
[00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:29.040]   sort of like the iPad two at the budget discount
[00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:33.880]   tablet price, maybe 199, 249, whatever they pick that to be.
[00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:35.600]   And then Apple is once again,
[00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:37.000]   they're not leaving an umbrella,
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:38.440]   but they're not making crappy products.
[00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:41.680]   And I think that's the best of both worlds for them.
[00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:44.960]   - All right, well, we've got some potential Mac news.
[00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:46.840]   Apple and Intel might be breaking up.
[00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:48.920]   They've been going steady for a long time.
[00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:49.800]   We'll get to that in a minute,
[00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:53.640]   but first let's take a break and to help us enjoy this break.
[00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:55.000]   I'm gonna hand it over to Leo.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:55.960]   Leo.
[00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:58.000]   - Hi, I hope you don't mind if you,
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.600]   if I interrupt just for a moment on Mac break weekly,
[00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:02.840]   because I'd like to talk a little bit about
[00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:05.240]   one of my very favorite companies, Citrix,
[00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:07.920]   and one of my very favorite products from Citrix,
[00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:10.720]   GoToMeeting.
[00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:13.520]   Their tagline meeting is believing
[00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:17.080]   and actually studies show that's actually true,
[00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:18.840]   believe it or not.
[00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:22.400]   We form bonds of trust with people
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:24.160]   based on visual cues,
[00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:25.800]   like whether they lean forward or backward,
[00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:27.400]   whether their arms folded or not.
[00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:31.640]   Well, there are only four key visual cues.
[00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:32.720]   I was amazing study.
[00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:34.040]   I just read about it in the New York Times
[00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:35.280]   a couple of weeks ago.
[00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:37.880]   And that kind of made me think, boy,
[00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:40.640]   this is why GoToMeeting is so cool.
[00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:42.280]   GoToMeeting with HD Faces,
[00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:45.360]   not only lets you see the screen
[00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:46.880]   of the person you're meeting with,
[00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:49.200]   but also lets you see their face.
[00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:51.680]   And that means you can develop that trust,
[00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:53.600]   that link with somebody.
[00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:56.240]   It's really kind of amazing.
[00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:58.920]   If you've got a camera on your computer,
[00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:00.520]   on your iPad,
[00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:04.120]   you can actually share video
[00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:07.200]   and see each other in video conferences.
[00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:09.600]   The quality is amazing.
[00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:10.440]   Really incredible.
[00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:13.440]   Let me just show you kind of how this would work.
[00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:15.240]   This is on the GoToMeeting site.
[00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:18.080]   GoToMeeting.com.
[00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:21.160]   It's a very good example of the HD Faces video.
[00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:23.320]   I've done a bunch of meetings with HD Faces now.
[00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:24.480]   This is exactly what it looks like.
[00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:25.760]   What's cool about it?
[00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:28.920]   So you see the screen you're sharing,
[00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:31.560]   it shares the screen of all the attendees
[00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:34.040]   with pictures of everybody video.
[00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:36.280]   The person who's talking is highlighted.
[00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:38.200]   You can tell who's talking.
[00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:39.240]   You can share control.
[00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:40.400]   You can rearrange it too,
[00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:43.320]   so that the video can be bigger or smaller,
[00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:45.040]   depending on whether you want to see it.
[00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:46.920]   It's very easy to set up a meeting,
[00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:48.640]   very easy to join a meeting.
[00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:51.760]   You can set up a meeting on a PC or a Mac.
[00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:56.760]   You can join a meeting on a PC Mac or iPhone or iPad
[00:38:56.760 --> 00:38:58.240]   or Android device.
[00:38:58.240 --> 00:38:59.520]   And if you've got an iPad,
[00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:01.480]   it'll even use the camera
[00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:04.880]   and the microphone and the iPad, which is awesome.
[00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:07.840]   HD video conferencing is now highly affordable.
[00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:11.520]   In fact, just $49 a month,
[00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:14.160]   but here's how you can use it for free.
[00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:18.880]   By the way, 30 days unlimited use the apps
[00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:21.520]   on the iPhone and the iPad are free too.
[00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:23.840]   So this will cost you nothing.
[00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:25.840]   And I want you to try it on all of those.
[00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:27.640]   Visit gotomeeting.com.
[00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:29.240]   See the orange try it free button?
[00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:30.720]   That's what you're looking for.
[00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:32.980]   The offer code is Mac break.
[00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:36.160]   All right, so where it says promo code,
[00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:38.600]   I should say, M-A-C-B-R-E-A case.
[00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:40.000]   That's case insensitive.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:41.920]   Use that though, so we get credit.
[00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:45.000]   Gotomeeting.com, try it today.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:50.240]   It is the best way to meet online Mac or PC.
[00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:51.080]   That's what's nice too.
[00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:51.920]   Your clients don't have to have
[00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:53.080]   any particular platform.
[00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:55.640]   Go to meeting.com.
[00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:56.680]   The offer code is Mac break.
[00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:59.880]   Now we take you back to Mac break weekly.
[00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:01.320]   - Thank you, Leo.
[00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:03.480]   Oh, we miss you already.
[00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:07.440]   Okay, before the break, I mentioned the story.
[00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:09.680]   This has come out of Bloomberg
[00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:14.360]   that Apple might be trying to see if it is feasible
[00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:17.440]   to move away from Intel chips in the Mac
[00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:19.880]   and switch over to an ARM architecture,
[00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:22.880]   which is of course something that Apple already uses
[00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:24.920]   in mobile products.
[00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:28.120]   Andy, obviously this would be more power efficient,
[00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:33.120]   but how many years away are we from it being as powerful
[00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:36.520]   as an Intel based Mac,
[00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:39.640]   which is for power users of the utmost importance?
[00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:44.040]   - Probably there are about two or all the reports I've read.
[00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:45.760]   And as soon as I was reading this,
[00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:47.600]   I was talking to some people who are smarter than me
[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:50.080]   on most things, including chip architecture.
[00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:52.280]   They're saying that they think two years
[00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:56.600]   at the earliest, three years as a practical thing to go.
[00:40:56.600 --> 00:41:01.600]   A lot to like about this rumor in that,
[00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:05.520]   obviously they've recently reorganized to put something
[00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:08.400]   in this subtlest chip architecture and chip design
[00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:11.840]   into a Zara level position at Apple.
[00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:15.280]   Like there was a top level guy who's very much invested
[00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:16.120]   in that.
[00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:19.440]   Also, there is so much that it's hardwired deep, deep,
[00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:21.760]   deep into the roots of the operating system
[00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:23.720]   that is designed to sort of blur the lines
[00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:26.400]   between a mobile operating system
[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:27.720]   and a desktop operating system.
[00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:29.760]   And here I'm not talking about things like multi-touch
[00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:31.240]   and nice animations.
[00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:35.080]   I'm talking about the way that the CPU deals with the battery,
[00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:37.400]   the way that it handles its data,
[00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:40.240]   the way that it moves information from one part
[00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:42.320]   of the CPU to the other.
[00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:45.120]   All of this is not necessarily optimized
[00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:47.560]   towards a low-power mobile processor,
[00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:50.200]   but it's designed so that if they were to take out
[00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:54.440]   a Nittel chip, put in an ARM architecture chip
[00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:56.840]   or something like that, it would go very, very smoothly.
[00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:58.000]   It wouldn't be an upheaval.
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.600]   It would just be a very, very natural transition.
[00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:03.360]   Still, the people, this is not new information.
[00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:06.280]   I had a long conversation with an Intel designer,
[00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:09.000]   Intel designer about seven or eight years ago,
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.600]   about, say, years ago, seven or eight months ago,
[00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:13.360]   about the difference.
[00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:16.280]   He's a guy who was actually planning on developing
[00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:18.800]   more mobile-oriented CPUs.
[00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:21.720]   And he says that he was telling me that the differences
[00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:24.200]   in what you can do if you're designing a CPU
[00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:26.760]   specifically for mobile versus what you can do
[00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:30.360]   with a specifically a desktop-oriented chip
[00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:32.240]   are pretty huge.
[00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:34.440]   There's like a wall between those two functions.
[00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:39.440]   So if you're trying to make laptops and little desktops
[00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:42.080]   that are designed to cover what 80% of people
[00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:44.560]   are gonna wanna do, things like Microsoft Office,
[00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:47.000]   keeping up with the web, doing a simple math,
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.440]   playing games, that is something that a mobile processor
[00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:53.360]   can handle, but it's the people who want to edit video,
[00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:55.920]   it's the people who wanna do really good software development,
[00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:59.120]   it's the top 20% that you start to really, really get
[00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:01.960]   very, very, very, very, so overall, my take on it
[00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:04.560]   is that they've got two or three years to work on this,
[00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:09.560]   I think, but it would be a shame if Apple decided
[00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:12.760]   that it's okay to get rid of the pro market
[00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:15.840]   and simply say we are gonna address the 80% of consumers
[00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:19.560]   that have 98% of the money and create a design
[00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:22.960]   that's optimized towards mobile, optimized towards then design,
[00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:25.240]   optimized towards low power consumption.
[00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:27.560]   And if it means that there's a lot of tasks
[00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:30.240]   that a Mac can't do anymore, that's okay
[00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:32.000]   because we've decided that's not the sort of machine
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:32.920]   we need to build anymore.
[00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:35.920]   I think that would be a shame if that would happen.
[00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:37.960]   - I could definitely see it happening as a slow progression
[00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:39.840]   where you actually have it,
[00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:44.400]   'cause I still am in the camp that believes that iOS
[00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:49.400]   and OS X are probably on a merger somewhere down the path.
[00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:51.760]   So I think they're gonna end up as one operating system
[00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:53.440]   in three to five years.
[00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:55.880]   And so I think that as they look at those things,
[00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:58.560]   I could definitely see some of our air laptops,
[00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:02.480]   which are not necessarily considered high performance machines.
[00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:04.120]   I mean, they're very fast now,
[00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:05.160]   but as the arm picks up,
[00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:07.440]   you could definitely see those getting replaced
[00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:08.440]   by those chips.
[00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:11.040]   And I think a lot has changed because I think one of the things
[00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:14.480]   is that you have, before it was like everybody was using
[00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:16.720]   these trucks, everyone was driving trucks.
[00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:19.840]   And now this market has changed dramatically.
[00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:22.000]   And I think that it's kind of a brave new world
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:23.320]   in a lot of ways from chip design
[00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:27.400]   where Intel isn't the obvious choice and the obvious advantage
[00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:30.600]   that it was when Apple chose to move to Intel.
[00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:33.280]   It is, there's a lot of players there right now,
[00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:34.120]   including Apple.
[00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:36.640]   And I think that Apple has the money to invest
[00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:38.440]   in that development if they choose to.
[00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:39.840]   So I think that that's,
[00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:43.400]   and of course I think Apple continues to own its own destiny.
[00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:46.120]   So I think that it owning its own chip manufacturing
[00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:48.520]   makes a lot of sense in that realm too.
[00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:50.520]   - Renee, I mean, what does this mean for Intel's model?
[00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:52.600]   Let's say Apple says, "Hey, we've figured out
[00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:53.880]   what we're going to do.
[00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:55.920]   Our customers will, they'll get used to it.
[00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:57.760]   We're going ARM only.
[00:44:57.760 --> 00:45:00.360]   Maybe there's a power drop,
[00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:03.720]   but there's certain power efficiency ramp up
[00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:06.600]   and maybe they figure out to do a little of both.
[00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:08.080]   What happens to Intel?
[00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:09.360]   Are they screwed?
[00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:10.200]   - Yeah.
[00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:11.120]   (laughing)
[00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:12.760]   Yeah, I mean, that's an interesting question.
[00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:15.520]   I think in some ways the story is being misreported
[00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:19.040]   as Apple is contemplating a switch to ARM architecture.
[00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:22.600]   Apple, and they said this when they switched from PowerPC
[00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:24.640]   to Intel is that Apple likes options.
[00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:25.640]   And exactly what Alex said.
[00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:28.040]   Apple doesn't like their destiny to be held hostage
[00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:28.960]   by any one company.
[00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:31.000]   So if something happens with Intel,
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.160]   if Intel falls behind or they can't deliver
[00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:34.520]   the chips that Apple wants,
[00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:37.600]   Apple may have ARM ready to go as a backup,
[00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:40.680]   or they might be, they just announced 64-bit ARM chips
[00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:41.520]   for the first time.
[00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:43.400]   And those are going to be on the roadmap now.
[00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:45.640]   And Apple is going to be well positioned
[00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:48.240]   maybe to transfer part of their Mac business.
[00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:50.000]   Like maybe an 11-inch MacBook Air
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.720]   or a 13-inch MacBook Air is a good candidate
[00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:54.640]   for a 64-bit ARM chip
[00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:57.560]   because the compromises in ARM make more sense there
[00:45:57.560 --> 00:46:00.680]   where something like the latest iMac,
[00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:02.880]   the 27-inch iMac will stay on Intel
[00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:05.160]   because that's the better processor.
[00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:08.640]   Intel's never made a really mobile power efficient chip
[00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:10.320]   and they've never really tried to make
[00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:11.920]   a super powerful ARM chip before,
[00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:15.840]   but both of those things are roadmap and architecture problems
[00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:17.640]   that someone like Bob Banzfield at Apple
[00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:19.920]   is really well positioned to solve.
[00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:23.800]   So I think this is Apple having simultaneous streams
[00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:25.280]   for their Mac computing platform.
[00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:27.800]   And I think it's something we'll see maybe a little bit
[00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:30.160]   on the more portable stuff in the future.
[00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:32.040]   - Yeah, there's some folks in the chat room saying,
[00:46:32.040 --> 00:46:34.000]   our Intel being screwed,
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.960]   Apple has a small percentage of Intel's total market,
[00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:40.760]   but that's, it's a momentum shift, right?
[00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:43.160]   I mean, if Apple says we don't need Intel,
[00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:45.480]   then other companies say, well, maybe we don't either
[00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:49.320]   if we don't have to sacrifice too much power for--
[00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:52.280]   - And they buy a lot of one chip, which is huge for Intel.
[00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:53.440]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:55.880]   And you've got it in the Windows market that's stagnating
[00:46:55.880 --> 00:46:59.640]   and you see, this is the sort of thing that I'm sure,
[00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:02.840]   it matters very much to Intel, which way Apple goes.
[00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:04.160]   But yeah, Renee, I agree with you.
[00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:06.240]   This is obviously not tomorrow
[00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:08.760]   and this is Apple weighing some options.
[00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:11.280]   They've increased their R&D spending
[00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:14.080]   by one billion in fact, just this year,
[00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:15.280]   because Apple has so much cash.
[00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:16.280]   I mean, what are they gonna do?
[00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:18.160]   - Is that what it costs to keep Bob Banzfield at Apple?
[00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:19.400]   Do we have a number on that now?
[00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:20.800]   (laughing)
[00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:22.280]   - Sure, that's part of it.
[00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:24.360]   All right, shall we move on to, gosh,
[00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:25.480]   what do you guys wanna talk about?
[00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:26.480]   You wanna talk iPhone?
[00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:29.520]   You wanna talk about the fact that iPhone owner loyalty
[00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:31.280]   has declined for the first time?
[00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:32.920]   Nobody wants to stay with iPhones anymore.
[00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:33.920]   No, I'm kidding.
[00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:37.000]   Let's look and make sure I'm getting these numbers
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:39.680]   actually right before I throw out something
[00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:41.480]   that I'm going to regret.
[00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:43.880]   - A grenade in the room when you run quietly behind.
[00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:46.560]   - Yeah, for the first time since the iPhone's inception,
[00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:48.240]   this is coming from Tom's hardware.
[00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:50.120]   The percentage of the smart phone
[00:47:50.120 --> 00:47:54.280]   owners who say that they will definitely or probably
[00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:57.400]   buy another Apple handset has declined.
[00:47:57.400 --> 00:48:00.840]   This is research conducted by Strategy Analytics.
[00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:04.080]   Study found that 88% of US iPhone owners
[00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:06.440]   are still likely to buy another Apple smartphone,
[00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:10.480]   but that's a decrease from 93% last year.
[00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:13.720]   If you compare that to Western Europeans,
[00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:16.880]   that totals around 75%, but also a decrease
[00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:21.880]   from 88%.
[00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:24.160]   We're looking at 88% of iPhone users saying,
[00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:26.920]   yes, I strongly plan to buy another iPhone.
[00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:31.080]   93% doesn't even sound like that's a real number.
[00:48:31.080 --> 00:48:33.560]   So it almost sounds like people being
[00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:37.360]   maybe a little bit more honest than they were a year ago.
[00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:40.080]   These numbers scare anybody?
[00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:41.440]   - They're a bit better competition, right?
[00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:43.280]   I mean, they used to not, the iPhone used to be
[00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:45.640]   a pretty singular entity and now I could easily see
[00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:49.160]   an HTC One X or a Galaxy S3 or a Nexus 4.
[00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:51.640]   There's even the 9/20s coming out now.
[00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:53.200]   There's a lot of really good phones
[00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:56.640]   and I think people just have better choices on the market now.
[00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:58.360]   - Yeah.
[00:48:58.360 --> 00:49:02.240]   Also, we hate to, as Apple fans, people who love our iPhones,
[00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:05.520]   we hate to think that any part of the iPhone success
[00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:10.520]   is due to it being a trendy brand, the hot, trendy brand.
[00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:14.000]   And I think that a lot, if there is any percentage
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:16.280]   of Apple's success that was based on the idea
[00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:18.000]   that people want something with an Apple logo on it,
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:19.560]   that the iPhone is the hot brand,
[00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:21.880]   the hot product that you wanna have,
[00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:23.520]   you wanna be seen carrying around.
[00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:24.880]   It's been around for a few years now
[00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:27.720]   and people might have moved on to new hot brands
[00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:29.040]   and new hot designs.
[00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:31.320]   This was the summer in which when I was testing
[00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:34.180]   the Samsung Galaxy S3 that someone said,
[00:49:34.180 --> 00:49:36.160]   at Chipotle, as they were selling my burritos,
[00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:38.840]   and oh my God, is that the new Samsung Galaxy S3?
[00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:40.560]   Like, oh my God, that's the coolest phone ever.
[00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:42.000]   That's my dream phone.
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:43.840]   And I was like, really?
[00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:46.160]   I didn't wanna insult someone who was preparing my food,
[00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:47.480]   but I was like, that's the,
[00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:50.120]   I have not have guessed two years ago
[00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:51.880]   that I'd be confronted by someone who thought
[00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:54.080]   that the phone in my end, that is made by Samsung,
[00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:56.040]   is the coolest phone ever.
[00:49:56.040 --> 00:49:58.360]   But yeah, it is about a greater diversity.
[00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:00.720]   And it's also about a point that I think crosses
[00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:04.160]   different product lines that people often talk about
[00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:06.800]   how Apple creates premium products.
[00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:08.200]   They don't wanna create netbooks.
[00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:09.920]   They don't wanna create crummy products
[00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:12.040]   that people are not gonna be happy with a month
[00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:15.480]   after they ship, and that's absolutely true.
[00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:17.440]   Unfortunately, I think that if there's gonna be a problem
[00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:19.680]   for Apple moving forward, it's that they're also not
[00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:22.440]   particularly interested in building a Toyota,
[00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:25.440]   you know, a perfectly fine car, in many ways,
[00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:30.280]   a great car that a greater spectrum of people can afford.
[00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:33.880]   And also the people who could afford the $50,000 car,
[00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:36.640]   a lot of people just can't justify spending 50 grand
[00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:38.720]   on a car for what they use a car for.
[00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:43.480]   So in Europe, I think there is greater price flexibility
[00:50:43.480 --> 00:50:45.600]   that you can get Android phones that are a lot less
[00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:48.320]   expensive than the equivalent iPhones.
[00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:49.920]   I'd have to double check on that.
[00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:54.240]   But when I think it's very, very telling that the one area
[00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:56.840]   in which Apple very, very quickly lost dominance
[00:50:56.840 --> 00:50:59.680]   of the market is the one area in which you can,
[00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:02.040]   they have to compete price for price for price,
[00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:04.720]   where you can get substantially the same kind of phone
[00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:06.600]   for either exactly the same price
[00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:08.720]   or a little less expensive for the competing phone.
[00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:11.600]   And that's where they're starting to have struggles
[00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:14.000]   and getting dominance in a certain area.
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:16.320]   So Apple just needs to keep making,
[00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:19.560]   find a way to make a Toyota that people are gonna like.
[00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:20.400]   - Alex, you agree?
[00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:24.240]   Is it partly a little bit of bad press,
[00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:26.600]   some cracks in the armor that Apple's been experiencing
[00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:27.440]   this year that's?
[00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:31.680]   - I think that the distortion field is wearing off.
[00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:33.440]   (laughing)
[00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:37.720]   I think that the center of that distortion field is gone
[00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:39.200]   and we're starting to,
[00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:41.320]   I do think that there's a certain coolness
[00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:43.920]   that emitted from Steve Jobs,
[00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:47.680]   that doesn't, there's kind of more of a matter of fact
[00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:50.080]   of this is a business and they're putting stuff out.
[00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:52.480]   And I really do think that there's a certain level
[00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:57.200]   of specialness that Steve brought to a lot of what Apple's
[00:51:57.200 --> 00:51:59.080]   doing and I think that now people are looking at it
[00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:02.480]   just as the product and there's less of that visceral
[00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:06.040]   connection that they had with Apple that they had before.
[00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:08.600]   And I also think that Apple is,
[00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:11.520]   it's hard to figure out how do you do something
[00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:12.960]   revolutionary every single time.
[00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:16.240]   I mean, I'm getting an iPhone 5,
[00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:17.960]   but am I super excited about it?
[00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:21.560]   Not really, I mean, I'm interested in the LTE
[00:52:21.560 --> 00:52:25.960]   for the most part and a little faster,
[00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:30.960]   but I'm not, I kind of look at it as my job,
[00:52:31.080 --> 00:52:33.880]   given that I'm on the show and I already feel like
[00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:35.560]   I've fallen behind 'cause I'm on the show
[00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:37.360]   and I don't have a 5.
[00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:41.800]   But the, if it was my own,
[00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:43.400]   like if I wasn't doing a show on it,
[00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:44.560]   would I get an iPhone 5?
[00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:46.040]   I don't know.
[00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:47.840]   It would definitely be a little bit slower removed.
[00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:49.480]   And so I think that Apple can't either
[00:52:49.480 --> 00:52:53.040]   have to keep on doing something really stupendous
[00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:57.040]   or they're gonna continue to slide into the mix
[00:52:57.040 --> 00:52:59.040]   of a lot of other things because Samsung
[00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:00.680]   and a lot of these other groups are spending,
[00:53:00.680 --> 00:53:02.360]   they're producing great products.
[00:53:02.360 --> 00:53:04.800]   And so I took them a little time to figure it all out,
[00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:07.160]   but that's gonna continue to move forward.
[00:53:07.160 --> 00:53:11.080]   And Apple's gonna either have to really push down the hard,
[00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:13.680]   which is I think we saw an increase in R&D.
[00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:15.920]   Or, and I think, and one of the things I do think
[00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:18.960]   is gonna be interesting is I think that Johnny
[00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:20.980]   and I have taken over the human interface
[00:53:20.980 --> 00:53:24.600]   could make a radical difference in how Mac products work
[00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:26.040]   and how they look and so on and so forth.
[00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:27.600]   And I think that might actually,
[00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:30.640]   I think he is the, he's still the person
[00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:33.160]   that people could get excited about at Apple.
[00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:35.360]   And I just haven't, we haven't seen him,
[00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:37.040]   he doesn't seem to have any interest in stepping up
[00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:39.840]   to do that, but he seems like he would be a great person
[00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:43.720]   from that kind of idealistic, very focused,
[00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:46.800]   artists that I think part of us feel like we want
[00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:49.400]   to see at Apple, which we don't see right now.
[00:53:49.400 --> 00:53:51.720]   - What about the iPhone 5 coming to China?
[00:53:51.720 --> 00:53:53.480]   What about that Chinese market?
[00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:57.880]   - There are two licenses in of the three that they need
[00:53:57.880 --> 00:53:59.800]   to sell the iPhone 5 and by all accounts,
[00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:03.680]   it looks like this will be cleared by the end of this year.
[00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:06.880]   The China's state radio management approved
[00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:11.080]   the A1429 version of the iPhone 5.
[00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:16.000]   That is compatible with China Unicom's 3G network.
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:19.640]   The second is the A1442 compatible
[00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:22.600]   with China Telecom's CDMA network.
[00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:26.600]   Now, China Unicom is number two, the number two carrier,
[00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:30.520]   I believe, and China Telecom is number three.
[00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:33.840]   Then we've got the Quality Certification Center
[00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:36.520]   that approved the device last week.
[00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:39.920]   And now Apple just needs network access license,
[00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:42.440]   a lot of licenses that have to happen in China.
[00:54:42.440 --> 00:54:47.040]   From China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.
[00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:49.400]   And then, you know, it's a free-for-all.
[00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:52.480]   Apple products are wildly popular in China,
[00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:55.880]   they're wildly popular in China,
[00:54:55.880 --> 00:54:58.000]   they're wildly popular in a lot of parts of the world
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:00.720]   where you wouldn't, so where we have this kind of rush
[00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:03.040]   of all, like everything available,
[00:55:03.040 --> 00:55:06.720]   in a lot of places that I travel in the world,
[00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:10.360]   an iPhone is still very much a status symbol,
[00:55:10.360 --> 00:55:11.360]   because they're harder to get,
[00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:12.840]   they're much more expensive compared
[00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:15.440]   to the average person's income.
[00:55:15.440 --> 00:55:19.360]   I know that in a lot of these other countries,
[00:55:19.360 --> 00:55:21.080]   I mean, it's still very much a status symbol.
[00:55:21.080 --> 00:55:22.560]   So I think that China, I think,
[00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:25.280]   produced a very large percentage of Apple's income,
[00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:26.800]   you know, as I think in the last quarter,
[00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:28.120]   I believe I can't remember what the number was,
[00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:29.800]   but I thought it was like 15% or something like that,
[00:55:29.800 --> 00:55:31.800]   which is a lot given that it's just still
[00:55:31.800 --> 00:55:32.800]   a new market for them.
[00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:34.960]   So, yeah, China's a big deal.
[00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:37.640]   - So, Force Field's still very much on in China.
[00:55:37.640 --> 00:55:39.040]   - We saw it on stage.
[00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:40.040]   (laughs)
[00:55:40.040 --> 00:55:41.680]   - It's different and distinct, you know, I mean,
[00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:42.720]   I think that that's the big thing.
[00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:47.200]   And in a lot of the, anywhere, that can be the case,
[00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:49.120]   but I think that we've kind of gotten used to them,
[00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:50.720]   like everybody has an iPhone.
[00:55:50.720 --> 00:55:53.040]   Everybody has an iPhone in the United States.
[00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:55.200]   Whereas in other places where it's been hard
[00:55:55.200 --> 00:55:56.800]   and that has been a constricted supply,
[00:55:56.800 --> 00:55:59.720]   I think that it's still seen as something very special.
[00:55:59.720 --> 00:56:02.600]   - I think we saw it on stage at WWDC.
[00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:05.240]   Apple had both the OS 10 and the iOS event,
[00:56:05.240 --> 00:56:08.160]   had a featured section, one of the new tent poles,
[00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:10.120]   as they call them for both operating systems,
[00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:11.920]   was better support for China.
[00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:14.080]   And every conference call Apple has,
[00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:16.440]   after an earnings report breaks down, you know,
[00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:19.080]   how important, I believe it's their most important market,
[00:56:19.080 --> 00:56:22.240]   after the US, the head of both Brazil and Russia,
[00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:23.480]   and other developing markets.
[00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:26.120]   And Apple is really, they're introducing new stores there.
[00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:27.600]   They're getting new products certified.
[00:56:27.600 --> 00:56:29.840]   They're selling iPads, they're selling iPhones.
[00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:32.560]   And Apple's international sales,
[00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:34.720]   I think we don't sometimes don't see that in North America.
[00:56:34.720 --> 00:56:36.360]   For example, the Kindle Fire,
[00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:38.120]   we look at those results and the Kindle Fire
[00:56:38.120 --> 00:56:39.640]   is sold in six, seven countries.
[00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:42.600]   Apple's selling their devices in 90 plus countries,
[00:56:42.600 --> 00:56:44.680]   100 plus for the iPhone now,
[00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:46.880]   and China is arguably the second most important one
[00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:48.320]   for them now.
[00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:49.400]   Well, and we have to remember that, you know,
[00:56:49.400 --> 00:56:51.760]   while we think of China as the average China,
[00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:54.600]   you know, we think of the average Chinese worker making,
[00:56:54.600 --> 00:56:56.400]   whatever, working on iPhones and so on and so forth.
[00:56:56.400 --> 00:56:58.680]   We have to remember that there's a lot of people in China
[00:56:58.680 --> 00:57:01.520]   and there is more people with the means
[00:57:01.520 --> 00:57:04.480]   to buy iPhones in China than there are in the United States.
[00:57:04.480 --> 00:57:07.160]   They may be a smaller percentage of the total population,
[00:57:07.160 --> 00:57:09.160]   but there's still an awful lot of there.
[00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:13.880]   - All right, before we move into some of our iOS news of the week,
[00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:15.560]   there's quite a bit of it.
[00:57:15.560 --> 00:57:18.360]   I think it's time to check back in with Leo,
[00:57:18.360 --> 00:57:21.360]   make sure he's okay and let him talk for a couple of minutes.
[00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:23.000]   This is his show after all.
[00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:24.440]   - Hey guys, just, if you don't mind,
[00:57:24.440 --> 00:57:26.080]   I'd like to step in and mocha mention our friends
[00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:28.800]   at carbonite.com, the show brought to you by Carbonite,
[00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:31.160]   the best backup solution, not just for Max,
[00:57:31.160 --> 00:57:32.440]   but for everyone.
[00:57:32.440 --> 00:57:34.560]   Carbonite is exactly what you're looking for
[00:57:34.560 --> 00:57:37.600]   in backup, automatic, continuous and offsite,
[00:57:37.600 --> 00:57:39.960]   offsite because, you know, that hurricane
[00:57:39.960 --> 00:57:42.320]   that just went through the East Coast, man,
[00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:46.000]   fire flood hurricane earthquake tornado,
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:49.120]   things happen that mean not only you lose your computer,
[00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:51.520]   but you could lose the backup if it's sitting right next to it.
[00:57:51.520 --> 00:57:53.400]   That's why offsite backup is a key part
[00:57:53.400 --> 00:57:56.760]   of your backup strategy and Carbonite makes this really easy.
[00:57:56.760 --> 00:57:59.160]   Whenever you're online, it's automatically,
[00:57:59.160 --> 00:58:02.080]   continuously backing up your data.
[00:58:02.080 --> 00:58:03.720]   Once you get that initial backup done,
[00:58:03.720 --> 00:58:07.480]   whether it's 10, 20, 30 gigabytes, that's fine.
[00:58:07.480 --> 00:58:09.160]   You'll have that stuff in the Carbonite cloud
[00:58:09.160 --> 00:58:10.680]   and then changes are backed up.
[00:58:10.680 --> 00:58:12.720]   And so incrementally, so it's very quick
[00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:15.120]   to keep up to date all the time.
[00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:16.800]   And anytime you wanna check your data,
[00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:19.240]   see if it's there, download a copy of a file,
[00:58:19.240 --> 00:58:21.600]   use it, you can, you log on to your Carbonite account
[00:58:21.600 --> 00:58:25.400]   on any computer or your Mac, your iPad or your iPhone,

[00:58:45.840 --> 00:58:48.960]   Really great solution, Carbonite.com,

[00:58:51.480 --> 00:58:53.000]   Back to you guys.
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:58.000]   - So iOS 6.0.1 became available,
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:00.920]   easy for me to download, I don't know about y'all.
[00:59:00.920 --> 00:59:03.080]   Although it was kinda weird, it was like,
[00:59:03.080 --> 00:59:07.520]   there was an iPhone 5 issue with downloading over the air
[00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:10.240]   because I kept saying, "Isn't it supposed to download by itself?"
[00:59:10.240 --> 00:59:13.680]   And then I had to download a little app that was temporary,
[00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:17.600]   run that app so that my over the air update could work.
[00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:18.720]   But then it did.
[00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:20.680]   Does anybody else have the same issue?
[00:59:20.680 --> 00:59:21.960]   - It was all the iPhone 5s.
[00:59:21.960 --> 00:59:24.240]   It was an issue with iPhone 5 over the air updating.
[00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:26.320]   So you had to, they would give you a pop up
[00:59:26.320 --> 00:59:27.560]   that says an update's available,
[00:59:27.560 --> 00:59:30.480]   and they would first give you the iPhone 5 updater.
[00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:32.800]   And when you ran that, it would then download the little app,
[00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:35.040]   put it on your springboard for a few seconds,
[00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:40.040]   and then launch the proper iOS 6.0.1 update.
[00:59:40.040 --> 00:59:42.480]   - And this, by the way,
[00:59:42.480 --> 00:59:45.760]   this, by the way, is the advantage of not standing in line.
[00:59:45.760 --> 00:59:48.080]   Is this all sorted out?
[00:59:48.080 --> 00:59:50.160]   It's all working by the time we,
[00:59:50.160 --> 00:59:51.920]   the time I actually get my iPhone 5.
[00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:52.840]   - That's why-- - Well, it's gonna come
[00:59:52.840 --> 00:59:54.960]   with 6.0, Alex, you're gonna have to update afterwards.
[00:59:54.960 --> 00:59:56.040]   - I don't know the back story.
[00:59:56.040 --> 00:59:58.800]   Why are you waiting to get the iPhone 5?
[00:59:58.800 --> 00:59:59.640]   Or what?
[00:59:59.640 --> 01:00:00.480]   Did you wait?
[01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:01.320]   - That's the best question.
[01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:02.840]   - I'm traveling.
[01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:04.280]   So here's the problem is like, keep on going,
[01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:06.080]   "Oh, I'm just gonna go to an Apple store and buy one."
[01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:07.120]   And then they're never available.
[01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:09.480]   And I'm in a different city every time I wake up.
[01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:10.560]   So I--
[01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:12.360]   - Is it just back-ordered at this point?
[01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:13.360]   - It was back-ordered.
[01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:15.800]   And then I just wanna be able to just walk into an Apple store.
[01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:18.280]   So I walk in and they never have the,
[01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:21.200]   whatever, the 64 black, whatever that I want.
[01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:24.600]   And so I walk in occasionally when I'm in different cities
[01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:25.640]   and just see if they're there.
[01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:27.480]   And because I'm traveling so much,
[01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:29.440]   like the idea of having it sent back to my office
[01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:31.800]   or my house doesn't, it's not very compelling
[01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:33.320]   'cause I'm not gonna be there for a while.
[01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:35.920]   So that's my, so I keep on thinking I'm gonna get it.
[01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:37.440]   And then I don't.
[01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:39.800]   Here I am, another day without, another Mac break
[01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:41.040]   without my five.
[01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:42.920]   - Oh yeah, it must be tough.
[01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:45.720]   They're keyboard glitches was one of the fixes
[01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:49.040]   that came to a 6.0.1.
[01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:51.280]   I was experiencing those keyboard glitches.
[01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:53.760]   In fact, well, I can't replicate it obviously
[01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:56.520]   because it's fixed now, but it was something that happened.
[01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:59.760]   If I was, for example, searching for, I don't know,
[01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:04.200]   an app, you know, Google type thing.
[01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:08.920]   Once I was, I would be able to type in the app
[01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:10.600]   I was looking for, okay.
[01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:12.240]   And then once I was getting to the point
[01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:14.840]   where I would either download or update that app,
[01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:15.880]   this is all app store stuff,
[01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:18.360]   that's the only time that I noticed it,
[01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:21.640]   I'd get these funny little horizontal lines on my keyboard
[01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:23.160]   and they sort of be there for a second
[01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:25.000]   and then they'd go away but didn't look good.
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:28.200]   And I started, at least for me, people on Twitter saying,
[01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:29.200]   "Are you noticing this?"
[01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:32.200]   It's saying, "Yeah, yeah, I'm, that looked very good."
[01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:33.840]   Some sort of processor issue,
[01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:35.280]   but apparently it's fixed by software
[01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:38.120]   'cause I haven't seen it in a while since then.
[01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:40.120]   - Yeah, iOS 6.0.1 fixed that.
[01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:43.000]   It was basically a bug fix release as, you know,
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.720]   as the 0.1's always are.
[01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:46.360]   And it fixed a bunch of issues
[01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:48.840]   that were annoying a bunch of people.
[01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:49.880]   - We are speaking of bugs.
[01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:53.800]   We already have a preview of what's coming to iOS 6.1.
[01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:56.800]   And that's a big fat bug report button
[01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:58.760]   coming to the Maps app.
[01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:00.880]   So it's easier than ever to say,
[01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:04.080]   "Hey, Maps, you sent me to the wrong place.
[01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:05.160]   This is terrible.
[01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:07.760]   I want to report this scenario."
[01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:11.080]   I actually, okay, so can I just get this story out
[01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:12.040]   and then I'll be done with it?
[01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:14.840]   I am not an Apple Maps Hater.
[01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:17.040]   I understand it's like, I gotta get used to it.
[01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:18.440]   I have other options.
[01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:20.560]   I have many other options, actually.
[01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:24.480]   And I download other Maps apps periodically and try them out
[01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:26.200]   and just kind of see where I am.
[01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:28.680]   But especially with the integration with Yelp,
[01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:31.440]   I end up using Apple Maps fairly often.
[01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:32.960]   And I don't hate them.
[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:35.040]   But I did have a situation the other day
[01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:37.280]   where something was wrong with my car
[01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:38.560]   'cause that's the story of my life.
[01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:39.880]   I get off the freeway.
[01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:41.360]   I'm on an exit.
[01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:42.360]   I don't know where I am.
[01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:45.840]   So I look up some auto body place.
[01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:47.960]   It's just like, I want to go somewhere close by
[01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:49.920]   and get this looked at.
[01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:52.680]   And so I found something that had a fairly good rating
[01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:54.920]   on Yelp, got the turn-by-turn directions.
[01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:57.600]   And Apple Maps took me to a nearby high school
[01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:01.680]   that was nowhere near where I think I was needing to go.
[01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:03.600]   And I was sort of circling the parking lot
[01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:06.280]   and I was in an infinite loop of Apple Maps
[01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:08.920]   just telling me to keep turning left, make a U-turn.
[01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:10.240]   Turn right, turn left.
[01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:12.040]   So they wanted me to go to the high school.
[01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:15.960]   So that was a specific situation where everything's fine.
[01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:18.600]   I didn't die, but it was extremely inconvenient
[01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:20.320]   and I was extremely upset.
[01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:21.320]   So.
[01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:23.600]   - I think this bug report button is just gonna be labeled,
[01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:25.160]   tell my wife I love her.
[01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:27.360]   (laughing)
[01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:30.680]   - I'm in an infinite loop, Max did it.
[01:03:30.680 --> 01:03:31.520]   So that'd be good.
[01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:35.160]   They're making it easier than ever to help them help us.
[01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:37.520]   - Yeah, I have to admit that I got taken down
[01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:41.440]   of the wrong direction a couple times over the last week.
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:44.120]   And I first, I was like, how can Google keep
[01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:44.960]   on screwing this up?
[01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:47.280]   And I was like, oh, wait, it's not Google anymore.
[01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:48.520]   (laughing)
[01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:51.480]   So yeah, I haven't had that until I like in San Francisco
[01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:53.280]   in the Bay Area, I didn't have any of that problem at all,
[01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:55.520]   but traveling, I have definitely found some areas
[01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:57.320]   where Apple sending me to parking lots.
[01:03:57.320 --> 01:04:00.520]   - What do you guys think about the other 6.1 update
[01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:05.280]   of Siri being able to purchase movies for you?
[01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:07.000]   Will the help of a fan dango, of course,
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.560]   but being able to say Siri, buy me tickets
[01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:11.520]   for the 730 movie for two tonight?
[01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:13.600]   - That's interesting 'cause Apple is doing that thing
[01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:15.680]   where it's brokering services now.
[01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:18.520]   So we had the ability to make restaurant reservations
[01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:22.240]   with OpenTable in iOS 6.0 and now they're adding
[01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:25.040]   movie tickets and I think in different geographies,
[01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:26.640]   they'll just keep making partnership deals
[01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:28.480]   and we'll see more and more services
[01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:30.840]   getting added to Siri like that.
[01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:32.760]   Unfortunately, they're not gonna fix maps in 6.1.
[01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:34.440]   That's gonna take a massive amount of human effort.
[01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:37.280]   So that's probably B70, but you will see movie tickets
[01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:38.600]   being available.
[01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:42.080]   - Andy, you're gonna tell Siri to buy you a movie?
[01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:45.360]   - I want Siri to tell me, oh no,
[01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:48.000]   Prometheus is not the movie you're hoping it should be.
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.440]   Here's a much better movie that's playing in Wooper
[01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:51.280]   instead.
[01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:55.720]   Yeah, it's interesting in that I don't,
[01:04:55.720 --> 01:04:59.280]   the problem with Siri is that there is no user interface
[01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:02.280]   and so users have to become aware that there are other,
[01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:04.280]   there are new things they can ask Siri to do
[01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:06.280]   and make that happen.
[01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:10.160]   If this gets rolled out and people just don't know
[01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:12.400]   that they can book table reservations,
[01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:15.280]   they can book tickets, then that feature almost
[01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:18.720]   may not even have to exist because people
[01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:20.480]   are gonna actually be using it.
[01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:24.760]   But it is, you see the huge upside to Apple,
[01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:27.360]   the more things that Apple can arrange for people
[01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:29.800]   to be able to buy through Apple services,
[01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:33.120]   the more important each of those registered credit cards
[01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:35.240]   they have attached to an iTunes account becomes
[01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:37.680]   and the more valuable the whole ecosystem becomes.
[01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:39.160]   So it's not only a case, I think,
[01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:41.800]   of making things more valuable for the consumer,
[01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:45.120]   but also just giving Apple a little bit more strength
[01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:46.160]   and a little bit more control
[01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:49.760]   and a little bit more negotiating room
[01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:52.120]   with every new service that they want to bring
[01:05:52.120 --> 01:05:53.720]   into the Apple fold.
[01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:55.040]   - And I think that a lot of times I know
[01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:58.320]   that I oftentimes want to, I just want everything to be
[01:05:58.320 --> 01:06:00.840]   in like, I want to buy everything through iTunes
[01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:01.760]   just 'cause I don't want to think about it.
[01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:03.560]   I don't want to think about my credit card number.
[01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:05.320]   I mean, I do that, I have a tendency to do that
[01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:08.400]   with Amazon where I want to buy everything through Amazon
[01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:09.920]   that isn't, that I can't buy through iTunes
[01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:12.320]   because I don't want to think about all that extra detail.
[01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:13.880]   They have all my information and you know,
[01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:16.600]   I know it'll show up tomorrow for $3.99
[01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:18.880]   or in two days or whatever.
[01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:20.880]   I just want that ease of use.
[01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:22.560]   And I think that Apple being able to take advantage
[01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:24.520]   of that ease of use I think is a big deal
[01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:26.800]   as long as my kids don't get to learn how to use Siri.
[01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:29.360]   So that otherwise I'll have to see Wreck It Ralph,
[01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:31.640]   like every day for the next month.
[01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:33.640]   - I think Alex and Andy are actually highlighting
[01:06:33.640 --> 01:06:35.360]   one of the huge problems with Siri,
[01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:38.120]   which is Apple is not controlling the end-to-end experience
[01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:39.160]   with a lot of this stuff.
[01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:40.960]   And you see that with Passbook too.
[01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:43.440]   The actual Passbook app experience is fantastic,
[01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:45.640]   but often the apps that feed into it
[01:06:45.640 --> 01:06:49.040]   or come out of Passbook are barely more than web apps
[01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:52.040]   in app wrappers that need you to put PayPal details
[01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:55.320]   into tiny little web forms and otherwise make it miserable
[01:06:55.320 --> 01:06:57.320]   to get stuff into or out of Passbook.
[01:06:57.320 --> 01:06:59.920]   And with Siri they are offload to open table.
[01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:01.080]   So you have to have an open table account
[01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:02.400]   to complete your reservation.
[01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:04.360]   And you'll likely need a Fandango account
[01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:06.560]   or whatever their provider is in your country
[01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:08.040]   to use movie tickets.
[01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:10.040]   And this still doesn't address the fundamental problem
[01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:12.160]   of Siri not working that well.
[01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:13.520]   It's been given to Eddy Q now,
[01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:15.680]   but it's still quite often in purple bubble,
[01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:17.600]   purple bubble, purple bubble, nothing,
[01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:20.760]   which frustrates users and after a while they stop using it.
[01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:22.720]   And you compare that to Google now
[01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:24.200]   or even the new Google search
[01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:27.520]   where they're doing more localized voice detection
[01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:29.200]   and they're providing predictive results
[01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:30.520]   based on what they think you're gonna do.
[01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:32.680]   So you don't have to wait for you to tell them all the time.
[01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:35.440]   And it just shows again that Apple with services
[01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:37.760]   isn't great and Apple with social isn't great.
[01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:40.680]   And Apple with social services is two not greats.
[01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:42.600]   And I think they're gonna have to invest a lot of time
[01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:44.280]   and effort to catch up in that.
[01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:46.360]   - Google voice search is amazing.
[01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:47.960]   I mean, I've been playing around with that this week.
[01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:50.000]   I mean, just speed alone.
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:53.600]   It is snappy and it's the voice sounds so much better
[01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:54.440]   than Siri's.
[01:07:54.440 --> 01:07:57.600]   - It's Google's 4K. - Yeah, it really is.
[01:07:57.600 --> 01:08:00.720]   - But I think that Apple does have to,
[01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:04.000]   I mean, I think that people oftentimes complain
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:08.280]   that Apple is very controlling over how they manage,
[01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:09.840]   that you have to buy everything,
[01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:12.320]   buying apps through the App Store and buying,
[01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:13.640]   all the stuff through the iOS store.
[01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:16.160]   The reality is, they just do it a lot better
[01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:17.360]   than everybody else.
[01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:19.560]   It really is a better solution.
[01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:23.480]   I mean, if an app costs less than $100
[01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:24.480]   and it's not on the App Store,
[01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:27.640]   the chances of me buying it is very low.
[01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:28.560]   You know, it's kind of like,
[01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:29.560]   I understand production apps,
[01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:31.960]   but for little apps, I'm just kind of like,
[01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:34.880]   I'd rather buy something like it on the App Store
[01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:37.320]   so I don't have to deal with installation again.
[01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:39.760]   - But how does it make money? - I wish Apple
[01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:40.880]   would all work with iTunes.
[01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:42.680]   Like if you could just use iTunes to pay for everything
[01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:45.840]   in Passbook, or you could just use iTunes to pay for it.
[01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:47.240]   Anything that I buy from my phone,
[01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:48.760]   it would be a much better experience.
[01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:51.040]   I understand companies are loath to give Apple
[01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:53.720]   the keys to that kingdom, but it would be so much better.
[01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:57.000]   - I still think Apple should just, you know,
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:58.480]   create their own bank.
[01:08:58.480 --> 01:09:01.240]   It's like how much they would save on transaction fees.
[01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:02.160]   And when you think about that,
[01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:03.760]   they got everybody's credit card numbers
[01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:05.280]   that they just built their own bank
[01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:07.080]   and then, you know, it would, anyway.
[01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:10.480]   - That'd be great, 'cause then you could buy like new iPhones
[01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:12.440]   on a subscription service.
[01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:16.520]   Whereas the second that Chiller says,
[01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:18.680]   and it's available today, beep, hi,
[01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:20.760]   we've just charged your credit card $299
[01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:22.360]   for the 64 gig by black model.
[01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:23.480]   You're welcome.
[01:09:23.480 --> 01:09:25.400]   - Your Apple credit card, which would be available
[01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:27.680]   more exclusively than the optimum card, it'd be fantastic.
[01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:31.240]   - So how many of us have ever bought an emoji app
[01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:33.120]   for more than free?
[01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:35.320]   Like anybody here bought a 99 cent emoji app
[01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:36.920]   at any point in time?
[01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:37.840]   No? - Healthy is charged.
[01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:38.960]   - Yeah, no, I have.
[01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:41.160]   - Okay, all right, well that makes two of us anyway.
[01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:44.160]   Andy and Alex say no, why would we do that sort of thing?
[01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:46.240]   - So the first one was like a buck or two bucks, wasn't it?
[01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:47.280]   When it first came out?
[01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:50.280]   - Well, I've always seen more than one.
[01:09:50.280 --> 01:09:52.640]   I think there was some app called Emoji Free
[01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:54.560]   where I went, oh cool, this is a great emoji app.
[01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:58.200]   And then there was an emoji pro, so I'll just go get that one
[01:09:58.200 --> 01:10:00.240]   'cause that one's better somehow.
[01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:03.720]   Of course, the story now is that Emoji apps
[01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:07.680]   may not be long for this world or at least the app store world
[01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:12.680]   since native iOS 6 supports emoji more than ever before.
[01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:16.120]   Of course, emoji is something that's just built in
[01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:19.080]   as an international keyboard and you can toggle it on or off.
[01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:21.600]   But if you have it on, you're one of those annoying people
[01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:23.160]   who now text this way.
[01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:26.040]   I am one of them, many of my friends are,
[01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:28.440]   but I also have other friends who think it is just
[01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:31.920]   the stupidest thing in the world speaking of trends
[01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:33.280]   and wanting it to go away.
[01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:37.160]   But developers told Mac rumors,
[01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:39.560]   I think the story is from about last Friday.
[01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:42.520]   We're getting notices from Apple saying that our apps
[01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:44.320]   have been pulled from the app store.
[01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:47.200]   And the verbiges for the most part,
[01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:51.560]   that this is part of the app store review guidelines
[01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:54.680]   that since emoji is part of iOS 6,
[01:10:54.680 --> 01:10:58.400]   it makes sense that your app is not really all that useful
[01:10:58.400 --> 01:11:01.160]   anymore, it's really just replicating something
[01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:03.040]   that Apple's already doing.
[01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:06.840]   And it's not really giving any entertainment value
[01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:11.360]   that Apple doesn't already give as part of native iOS.
[01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:12.360]   Now some of those developers said,
[01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:14.360]   "Well, the apps are still there,
[01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:16.640]   so are they coming down?"
[01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:18.440]   In some cases, they already have,
[01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:23.240]   in other cases, it sort of remains to be seen.
[01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:25.640]   But if you search for emoji in the app store,
[01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:28.040]   you get a lot of emoji apps.
[01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:30.280]   You also get a lot of apps that aren't necessarily
[01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:32.880]   emoji apps, but have that word somewhere
[01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:34.160]   in their developer notes.
[01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:36.680]   So I think that they're getting flagged too.
[01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:39.200]   I'd be pretty upset if I was a developer who's like,
[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:42.560]   "I'm not really even an emoji app, this sucks."
[01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:43.920]   But then again, this is awesome.
[01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:44.760]   - I was trying to gain the system innocently enough,
[01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:47.480]   and I'm getting caught hoisted by my own patar.
[01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:48.800]   It's completely not.
[01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:51.040]   Yeah, that's interesting because it's one of those things
[01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:52.480]   where I think Apple doesn't have to do it,
[01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:55.880]   but they, of all the spam that they could clean out
[01:11:55.880 --> 01:11:57.960]   of the app store, and there are still tons of spam,
[01:11:57.960 --> 01:12:00.080]   they're wasting their time with emoji icons.
[01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:01.920]   And then I lose a game of letter press
[01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:03.120]   to one of my writers, Georgia,
[01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:06.080]   and she sends me an emoji, and then the screenshot
[01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:08.360]   blown up of that emoji, and then the screenshot of that
[01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:10.480]   blown up again until all you see is those horrible,
[01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:13.560]   hateful eyes, and I kind of wish they would ban all emoji.
[01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:15.400]   (laughs)
[01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:17.520]   - But it's such a good way of expressing yourself.
[01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:20.520]   Okay, well, whether or not we think emoji's a great thing.
[01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:23.280]   I mean, Andy, is it good riddance for a bunch
[01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:26.320]   of crappy emoji apps that are littering the app store
[01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:28.760]   and some that shouldn't be charging a dime?
[01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:32.840]   - Yeah, I mean, well, let's state right up at the top
[01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:35.200]   that nobody can ever be really, really thrilled
[01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:38.600]   by the idea that a piece of software that used to be available,
[01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:40.920]   that used to be perfectly okay according to Apple,
[01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:43.840]   is now for botans being removed and now you can't have it.
[01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:47.120]   That's exactly this sort of bad, bad, bad, bad, bad,
[01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:50.320]   double plus un-bad, un-good news that people thought
[01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:52.880]   was gonna happen when Apple said that we're gonna be
[01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:55.480]   controlling the app store totally for delivery of apps
[01:12:55.480 --> 01:12:56.560]   on the iPhone.
[01:12:56.560 --> 01:12:58.320]   On the other hand, this is exactly what,
[01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:01.200]   that kind of policy was meant to do well.
[01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:02.880]   Wouldn't you feel horrible if you knew that,
[01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:05.480]   oh, I just spent $1.99 on this emoji app.
[01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:06.720]   When I didn't actually need it,
[01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:08.960]   this is actually built right into the operating system.
[01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:10.240]   Why didn't Apple tell me that?
[01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:14.280]   Why did Apple try to get, is Apple so keen to get 30%
[01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:17.000]   of that sale that they're willing to sell to me
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:18.760]   all the features that are built into my phone anyway?
[01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:20.120]   What is this?
[01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:21.760]   But also, Renee is absolutely right.
[01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:23.520]   There's just so much spam on these things.
[01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:26.480]   When you try to look, it's a horrible, horrible,
[01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:30.680]   or deal, when you try to find a worthy app based on
[01:13:30.680 --> 01:13:33.280]   a logical keyword about what it does.
[01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:35.040]   Because if you look for word processor,
[01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:38.640]   you're gonna find maybe the five really good word processors
[01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:39.920]   that are available for the iPad.
[01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:42.760]   But you're also gonna find a million stupid apps
[01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:46.200]   that are just, people who just bought one of the big nerd
[01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:48.120]   ranch books and decided to write a text editor
[01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:49.640]   and charge $5 for it.
[01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:51.200]   Or people who decided, well, people,
[01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:53.520]   a lot of the top three paid apps in this category
[01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:54.440]   are word processors.
[01:13:54.440 --> 01:13:58.680]   If we say that, if we wanna sell one of our eBooks,
[01:13:58.680 --> 01:14:00.080]   if we wanna sell one of our games,
[01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:01.880]   we'll just put the word processor in it
[01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:03.640]   to try to take the search results.
[01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:06.560]   So, I mean, Apple could create its own,
[01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:10.000]   its own $100 million company that does nothing but curate
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:13.040]   and weed out all of these apps that are either pointless,
[01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:16.000]   useless, deliver no value, or at least are not gonna be,
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:17.640]   are gonna make it more difficult for users
[01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:19.560]   to find the apps they actually want.
[01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:24.480]   But where's the line, Andy? Where is the line?
[01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:27.400]   As God's chosen emissary on this plane,
[01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:29.960]   I define where that line is.
[01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:32.520]   Pray that I do not move that line further.
[01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:34.320]   It's like, you know, Apple runs a boutique,
[01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:37.160]   not a flea market, and if they used to sell bottled water
[01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:39.320]   and now they're giving you away water for free,
[01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:41.640]   they'll remove the bottled water from their selection.
[01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:44.320]   And the bottled water company will lose a source
[01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:47.360]   of distribution, but you know, there's plenty of room
[01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:48.560]   for them on the Android market,
[01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:50.600]   so we don't have to weep for all of them.
[01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:52.440]   - Well, we've got two conflicting stories
[01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:55.000]   speaking of the App Store and what could be approved
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:56.600]   or yanked.
[01:14:56.600 --> 01:15:00.280]   The Guardian writes, "We've got sources from within Google
[01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:04.920]   "who do not think that this maps app
[01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:07.560]   "that we're working on diligently
[01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:09.160]   "and we're gonna be ready with
[01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:11.040]   "by possibly the end of the year
[01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:13.760]   "is going to be approved in the App Store."
[01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:17.920]   Now, that causes a chain reaction of people saying,
[01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:19.000]   "How could Apple do this?
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.720]   "It's so selfish as the users who lose."
[01:15:21.720 --> 01:15:23.280]   - It's just that easy.
[01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:24.360]   (laughs)
[01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:25.200]   - Right.
[01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:28.240]   - This product is very, very, if you wanna create a store,
[01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:29.400]   if you wanna make sure that like,
[01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:32.760]   you feel as though I think that likely Obama voters
[01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:35.760]   are people who get upset about controversy at the App Store,
[01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:37.920]   let's put out a half of a sentence about,
[01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:40.360]   "We don't know if they're gonna release our Google
[01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:41.480]   "and maps app."
[01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:43.280]   And then just, people stay home
[01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:46.720]   and write angry diet drives about how the world works.
[01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:47.880]   Works great.
[01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:50.880]   - Given the negative reaction Apple got,
[01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:54.480]   when Google Voice was pocket vetoed,
[01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:56.680]   it was just left on a shelf and never approved,
[01:15:56.680 --> 01:15:58.880]   there were rumors of government investigations,
[01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:01.720]   there was a tremendous amount of pressure put on Apple,
[01:16:01.720 --> 01:16:03.840]   on carriers, on everybody.
[01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:06.080]   Apple took their sweet time with Google Search,
[01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:07.160]   but they approved it.
[01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:09.000]   I don't think there is any situation
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:13.320]   where Apple could not approve a legitimate Google Maps app.
[01:16:13.320 --> 01:16:15.560]   So I think this kind of story is just,
[01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:16.840]   it's fading the headline.
[01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:20.280]   - Yeah, I've seen it had a good rebuttal saying,
[01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:23.480]   "Engineers worried that Apple isn't going to approve an app
[01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:25.320]   "is just what happens.
[01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:27.480]   "That's what you do as a developer.
[01:16:27.480 --> 01:16:29.960]   "You hope that not only are you approved,
[01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:31.720]   "but then you don't get yanked at a later time
[01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:35.360]   "when Apple slightly changes their terms of services.
[01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:36.960]   "This is Apple anyway."
[01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:38.640]   - I think that at this point,
[01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:41.280]   we really do have to set aside the idea of Apple
[01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:43.600]   canning apps for strictly political
[01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:45.840]   or strictly corporate strategy reasons,
[01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:48.280]   because they've now had a long track record
[01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:49.720]   of approving and disapproving apps,
[01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:51.680]   and nobody's been able to demonstrate
[01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:53.000]   a real track record of Apple
[01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:56.520]   ever been in an app exactly for that reason.
[01:16:56.520 --> 01:16:58.480]   Sometimes those reasons make absolutely no sense.
[01:16:58.480 --> 01:17:00.380]   Sometimes they're needlessly drawn out
[01:17:00.380 --> 01:17:02.560]   and frustrating and opaque to developers.
[01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:04.160]   But I don't think that anybody can make a case
[01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:07.280]   that that's a documentable problem
[01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:09.760]   with the apps approval process.
[01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:12.080]   So I don't-- - Oh, for me it does?
[01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:14.880]   - I just, I'm just a wrap it up that I don't,
[01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:18.480]   I don't think that if Google filed a maps app
[01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:20.640]   that conform to guidelines,
[01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:22.560]   I don't think that Apple might drag their feet
[01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:23.880]   a little bit about it just to make sure
[01:17:23.880 --> 01:17:25.720]   that this is an okay app,
[01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:27.040]   but I don't think anything would prevent them
[01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:28.200]   from blocking it.
[01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:30.040]   Excuse me, anyone, they would prevent them
[01:17:30.040 --> 01:17:32.240]   from approving it for a sale app store.
[01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:33.280]   - Part of me does think though,
[01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:35.480]   that someone has a nephew that works in the app store,
[01:17:35.480 --> 01:17:37.520]   and it's sort of like Will Farrell in "Elf" dancing
[01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:39.840]   on the table where he approves tether apps,
[01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:41.840]   Willy and Nilly that get yanked later,
[01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:43.080]   and he disappro, you know,
[01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:45.160]   he approves the Pokemon app that's only a screensaver
[01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:46.280]   but costs five bucks,
[01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:49.400]   and then keeps Google search in the shelf for, you know,
[01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:50.480]   two, three months,
[01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:52.200]   'cause it's absolutely no rotten reason
[01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:54.080]   to some of the stuff that they approve or disapprove
[01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:55.760]   and the reversals that happen later,
[01:17:55.760 --> 01:17:57.120]   but exactly like Andy said,
[01:17:57.120 --> 01:17:59.000]   for the high profile stuff,
[01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:00.540]   Apple has very little leeway.
[01:18:00.540 --> 01:18:03.840]   - All right, before we get into Semivar,
[01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:05.640]   ooh, we've got some apologies,
[01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:07.400]   we've got some miscellaneous news,
[01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:09.280]   Andy, I know you're really looking forward
[01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:11.640]   to some of the legal stuff.
[01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:13.760]   - A lot on the part of Apple.
[01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:15.000]   Let's take-- - Time to change my pants.
[01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.920]   I think I just ruined the pair I learned right now.
[01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:20.800]   - Told you, he's really excited, it's so cute.
[01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:24.440]   Let's kick it over to Leo the third of four times
[01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:25.640]   during the show.
[01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:28.480]   Leo, who are you thinking?
[01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:29.320]   - Thank you guys,
[01:18:29.320 --> 01:18:32.040]   Mac Break Weekly brought to you today by hover.com,
[01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:35.320]   domain, name, registration and management,
[01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:38.920]   that's simple, that's clean, that's pure, that's honest.
[01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:39.840]   This is what you're looking for,
[01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:41.000]   you don't need a lot of upsell,
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:42.800]   you don't need a lot of sexy girls in the ads,
[01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:45.640]   you just need to register a domain
[01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:49.200]   at an affordable price to not have to click 100 times
[01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:51.840]   just to buy the domain, hover so great,
[01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:53.360]   they find their inspiration,
[01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:55.000]   I've talked with Elliot Noster, CEO,
[01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:58.040]   he says, we get our inspiration from Apple,
[01:18:58.040 --> 01:19:03.040]   the clean, aesthetic, the simple, powerful management,
[01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:06.280]   we really are trying to make something that good.
[01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:08.280]   Something that you go, wow, this is exactly right,
[01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:09.960]   this is elegant, this is easy,
[01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:11.720]   they don't believe in heavy handed upselling
[01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:14.080]   or cross selling, in fact,
[01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:15.560]   those other guys, they will,
[01:19:15.560 --> 01:19:17.080]   before you're allowed to buy a domain,
[01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:18.200]   they'll try to sell you a bunch of stuff
[01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:20.200]   including domain name privacy, right?
[01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:21.400]   That's a good thing, you don't want anybody
[01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:23.880]   to have your address, your phone number,
[01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:26.400]   hover just bundles that in, it's part of the deal
[01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:29.840]   'cause they know that you would want that.
[01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:32.840]   Who has privacy, subdomains, URL forwarding,
[01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:34.840]   all included in the price,
[01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:36.720]   they only partner with companies
[01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:39.080]   they think are offering great value,
[01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:43.480]   you're not a lot upsell, they have all the main TLDs.com.net.org
[01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:46.720]   as well as.tv.pro.moby.biz,
[01:19:46.720 --> 01:19:51.720]   even some popular country code TLDs like.ca.Asia.usn.uk.
[01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:56.160]   Hover is brought to you by two cows,
[01:19:56.160 --> 01:19:59.080]   these guys have been doing this for a long, long time,
[01:19:59.080 --> 01:20:00.440]   they know customer service,
[01:20:00.440 --> 01:20:05.440]   they know customer support call 866-731-6556-866-731.
[01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:10.440]   655-6, you will get Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern.
[01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:13.440]   You will get an expert who will solve your problem,
[01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:15.440]   who will not put you on hold.
[01:20:15.440 --> 01:20:18.440]   You can just go to hover.com, you don't even have to call 'em,
[01:20:18.440 --> 01:20:22.440]   but I do like the idea, if you have domains registered elsewhere,
[01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:24.440]   there are domain transfer service,
[01:20:24.440 --> 01:20:26.440]   there are concierge services, great,
[01:20:26.440 --> 01:20:28.440]   call that number to initiate that,
[01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:29.440]   then you don't have to do all that.
[01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:31.440]   So annoying to transfer service,
[01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:33.440]   there's no way to do that.
[01:20:33.440 --> 01:20:37.440]   So annoying to transfer domain names, they'll do it for you.
[01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:41.440]   Hover.com, now, when you use the offer code MAC break,
[01:20:41.440 --> 01:20:45.440]   you'll get 10% off your new domain name,
[01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:49.440]   or visit hover.com/macbreak,
[01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:52.440]   hover.com/macbreak,
[01:20:52.440 --> 01:20:56.440]   simplified, elegant domain name management
[01:20:56.440 --> 01:20:59.440]   and server management from Hover.
[01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:02.440]   Hover.com, use the offer code MAC break.
[01:21:02.440 --> 01:21:05.440]   Hey, thanks, Leo.
[01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:07.440]   We're back with Mac break weekly,
[01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:10.440]   Andy Enochko, Alex Lindsay, and Renee Ritchie are joining me
[01:21:10.440 --> 01:21:14.440]   nicely, since Leo Laport is on vacation this weekend next,
[01:21:14.440 --> 01:21:16.440]   by the way.
[01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:20.440]   So I mentioned that we were going to talk about some,
[01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:24.440]   well, retractions, I guess, some rewriting orders.
[01:21:24.440 --> 01:21:26.440]   This is a story from last Thursday.
[01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:28.440]   This is kind of hysterical, actually.
[01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:32.440]   Apple had been forced to make it clear that Samsung
[01:21:32.440 --> 01:21:36.440]   did not infringe on Apple's iPad
[01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:39.440]   Register design in the UK.
[01:21:39.440 --> 01:21:43.440]   So Apple went ahead and wrote an apology,
[01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:47.440]   and Samsung said, you know, that's not the apology
[01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:51.440]   that the court said that Apple had to write.
[01:21:51.440 --> 01:21:55.440]   Apparently, Samsung complained, well, no,
[01:21:55.440 --> 01:22:00.440]   Apple mentioned other comments about other
[01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:03.440]   rulings in Germany, in the US,
[01:22:03.440 --> 01:22:06.440]   and that sort of made it seem like, well,
[01:22:06.440 --> 01:22:08.440]   Apple's sort of right, even though we're being forced
[01:22:08.440 --> 01:22:11.440]   to publish this apology, and that's inaccurate,
[01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:13.440]   and that's misleading.
[01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:16.440]   And the judge agreed and told Apple, you know what,
[01:22:16.440 --> 01:22:19.440]   you've got to rewrite this, and you've got to put something up
[01:22:19.440 --> 01:22:24.440]   in the next 48 hours, and it has to be a certain font size
[01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:28.440]   so that, you know, you can't make it in white on a white background.
[01:22:28.440 --> 01:22:32.440]   There are all these things, like, no, Apple, you've got to do this the right way.
[01:22:32.440 --> 01:22:35.440]   A lawyer representing Apple said, well, wait a second.
[01:22:35.440 --> 01:22:37.440]   We thought we were complying.
[01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:39.440]   We're not supposed to be punished here.
[01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:42.440]   We're not supposed to be groveling.
[01:22:42.440 --> 01:22:46.440]   We're supposed to dispel commercial uncertainty,
[01:22:46.440 --> 01:22:50.440]   and then said, and we need more time than these 48 hours.
[01:22:50.440 --> 01:22:58.440]   We need more like 14 days to figure out the right replacement.
[01:22:58.440 --> 01:23:00.440]   And Judge said, no, you can't have that.
[01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:01.440]   You can't have that at all.
[01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:03.440]   We're not going to do this first, please.
[01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:06.440]   The guy who has the password to our WordPress is on vacation.
[01:23:06.440 --> 01:23:08.440]   We can't change the website for another week or two.
[01:23:08.440 --> 01:23:12.440]   It's just like having a four-year-old.
[01:23:12.440 --> 01:23:14.440]   It's like, did you brush your teeth?
[01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:15.440]   Yes, I did.
[01:23:15.440 --> 01:23:16.440]   Okay.
[01:23:16.440 --> 01:23:19.440]   Did you stand in front of the mirror?
[01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:21.440]   Did you put toothpaste on the toothbrush?
[01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:26.440]   Did you rub the toothbrush with the toothpaste around your teeth up and down, up and down
[01:23:26.440 --> 01:23:30.440]   for at least 30 to 45 minutes, 30 to 45 seconds?
[01:23:30.440 --> 01:23:32.440]   It's like, oh, God.
[01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:35.440]   I mean, the judge gave them such a simple and direct order.
[01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:37.440]   They decided to do it in a flippant way.
[01:23:37.440 --> 01:23:38.440]   And they're like, what?
[01:23:38.440 --> 01:23:39.440]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:23:39.440 --> 01:23:40.440]   I'm sorry.
[01:23:40.440 --> 01:23:41.440]   Is this bugging you?
[01:23:41.440 --> 01:23:42.440]   I'm not touching you.
[01:23:42.440 --> 01:23:43.440]   I'm not touching you.
[01:23:43.440 --> 01:23:44.440]   Why is this bugging you?
[01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:45.440]   I'm not touching you.
[01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:46.440]   You said not to touch you, but I'm not touching you.
[01:23:46.440 --> 01:23:47.440]   It's like, oh, for God's sakes.
[01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:48.440]   How old?
[01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:49.440]   Where are you, Apple?
[01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:50.440]   Yikes.
[01:23:50.440 --> 01:23:56.040]   Oh, I have to admit that I think that Apple returned an immature ruling with an immature
[01:23:56.040 --> 01:23:57.040]   action.
[01:23:57.040 --> 01:24:00.960]   I mean, the thing is, is this whole like you have to file whatever in public.
[01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:01.960]   I mean, that's something.
[01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:02.960]   I don't know.
[01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:03.960]   It was just when I saw it.
[01:24:03.960 --> 01:24:12.000]   It was, it was, it was, it was an idiotic ruling.
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:13.000]   It was idiotic.
[01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:14.000]   Idiotic.
[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:17.520]   I was like, I was taking a steak and for an iPad.
[01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:19.520]   But they did something wrong.
[01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:20.520]   Find them.
[01:24:20.520 --> 01:24:23.880]   You know, if they, if they broke the law, put them in jail, but having them print little
[01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:25.640]   things and they were just stupid.
[01:24:25.640 --> 01:24:29.080]   You know, so, so of course Apple did, you know, they did something stupid with it.
[01:24:29.080 --> 01:24:30.640]   It was just a stupid ruling.
[01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:31.640]   You know, so I, I'm sorry.
[01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:34.960]   I just was like watching this guy was like, you know, it's that whole like we're going
[01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:39.480]   to, I don't know, is judges thinking that they're bigger than they are or proving that
[01:24:39.480 --> 01:24:41.320]   they are as big as they think they are or whatever.
[01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:45.720]   But there's more of a control thing of a judge being stupidly creative rather than just
[01:24:45.720 --> 01:24:47.320]   following the law.
[01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:50.480]   I think they published the judges comments too when he said that the galaxy tab wasn't
[01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:53.120]   cool enough to be mistaken for an iPad.
[01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:55.560]   So Apple made sure to include that in the original text.
[01:24:55.560 --> 01:24:57.280]   Yeah, I agree with both of them.
[01:24:57.280 --> 01:24:59.240]   It was a silly ruling.
[01:24:59.240 --> 01:25:00.400]   It was a silly response.
[01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:06.160]   And now Apple has below, way below the fold on actually programmatically below the fold
[01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:12.120]   on apple.com/uk a more linear, more court approved apology.
[01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:16.120]   And I do think Denny Crane is absolutely their lawyer guiding all this.
[01:25:16.120 --> 01:25:21.560]   Yeah, there's a, there's a nice, there's a nice little updated apology.
[01:25:21.560 --> 01:25:28.960]   It's not really an apology again, but just let's clarify as ordered by the judge that
[01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:32.120]   ran in the Guardian in 14 point aerial font.
[01:25:32.120 --> 01:25:33.120]   It's very important.
[01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:34.120]   It's the aerial.
[01:25:34.120 --> 01:25:35.120]   No, Helvetica for them.
[01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:36.120]   No, no, no, no.
[01:25:36.120 --> 01:25:37.640]   We want to, we just want people to read it.
[01:25:37.640 --> 01:25:39.480]   We don't want to think about design too much.
[01:25:39.480 --> 01:25:40.760]   Make it big.
[01:25:40.760 --> 01:25:43.120]   Make it nice and black on newspaper font.
[01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:46.400]   So yeah, it's, that's what we got there.
[01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:48.320]   I'd read it, but we all know what it says.
[01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:52.920]   It's basically what they said earlier without the ha ha flippant stuff.
[01:25:52.920 --> 01:25:56.280]   Oh, Apple and Samsung, will they ever get along?
[01:25:56.280 --> 01:25:59.840]   Well you just have, have sex with each other and get it over with.
[01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:02.120]   We're just, I mean, we're just sick and tired of watching this.
[01:26:02.120 --> 01:26:04.280]   We just end the dance already.
[01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:07.160]   I know I am sick and tired of it.
[01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:10.560]   We talk about, we have Apple and Samsung patent stuff on Twitch.
[01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:11.560]   Way too much.
[01:26:11.560 --> 01:26:12.560]   Come on.
[01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:16.080]   We'll get more fun for us to cover you guys.
[01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:20.560]   Anybody excited about the official third party lightning accessories from Belkin?
[01:26:20.560 --> 01:26:21.560]   Ooh.
[01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:22.560]   No?
[01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:23.560]   That's a car charger.
[01:26:23.560 --> 01:26:25.560]   I think it's a car charger.
[01:26:25.560 --> 01:26:27.840]   Yeah, we've got a, we've got two.
[01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:31.720]   So there's a, there's, let me make sure I wait.
[01:26:31.720 --> 01:26:35.520]   Yeah, so there's a car charger and then a charge plus a sync dock.
[01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:36.520]   It's both are about.
[01:26:36.520 --> 01:26:38.280]   It's faster than Thunderbolt.
[01:26:38.280 --> 01:26:39.280]   Yeah.
[01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:44.960]   You know, I've got a little Belkin, a little Belkin iPad, or iPhone stand right now.
[01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:45.960]   I like a lot.
[01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:49.840]   The interesting thing with this is that Apple is much more tightly controlling lightning
[01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:53.240]   connectors than they ever did the 30 pin dock connectors.
[01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:54.960]   And they also have this under incredible NDA.
[01:26:54.960 --> 01:27:00.080]   Like if you think the iOS NDA is harsh, the dock connector, lightning connector NDA is
[01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:02.320]   a hundred times more strict.
[01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:06.160]   But it sounds like small part, small batch stuff will no longer be permitted.
[01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:10.640]   It'll have to go to an approved Apple manufacturer to get this stuff made.
[01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:15.440]   So it'll probably be the big companies with the most mainstream accessories.
[01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:19.520]   And then we'll see the smaller, more niche stuff like scientific instruments switch to
[01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:24.320]   either Bluetooth or 3.5 millimeter headset jack like square uses.
[01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:28.720]   So it'll be a more interesting accessory ecosystem if nothing else.
[01:27:28.720 --> 01:27:29.720]   It's funny.
[01:27:29.720 --> 01:27:34.720]   Martin Naveela, who's the general manager at Belkin's core division says people are eager
[01:27:34.720 --> 01:27:36.040]   for lightning accessories.
[01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:41.880]   And Belkin's give them a reliable way to keep their new iPhone 5 or iPad 4th gen, iPad
[01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:45.720]   mini, iPod touch, charge protected and ready to go.
[01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:50.400]   I am not sitting around finding myself eager for new lightning accessories.
[01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:57.320]   I'm more eager for accessories that don't now, that are compatible with my headphone
[01:27:57.320 --> 01:27:59.440]   jack that is on the bottom of my iPhone.
[01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:01.160]   I find that to be more of an issue.
[01:28:01.160 --> 01:28:02.480]   Do you use a dock, Sarah?
[01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:07.280]   It's a big split in the Apple community whether you use a dock or you don't use a dock.
[01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:08.280]   I don't use a dock.
[01:28:08.280 --> 01:28:09.920]   I don't use a dock either.
[01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:12.200]   No, I almost never use a dock.
[01:28:12.200 --> 01:28:13.200]   I mean, I have one.
[01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:17.880]   I the dog that I use the most often is that hotels, you know, they have the little clock
[01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:20.520]   with the little dock on it next to your bed.
[01:28:20.520 --> 01:28:24.880]   And I find now that I measure hotels, like if they don't have it, I'm a little perturbed
[01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:26.400]   that I now have to find my.
[01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:30.520]   Well, you realize though, when you get your iPhone 5, it'll be basically like none of
[01:28:30.520 --> 01:28:31.520]   the other way.
[01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:36.600]   So yeah, I've got an alarm clock with a dock as well because it's one of those alarm
[01:28:36.600 --> 01:28:38.920]   clocks that's supposed to measure my sleeping patterns.
[01:28:38.920 --> 01:28:41.600]   And so it's like, okay, a iPhone doesn't fit anywhere.
[01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:44.040]   I'll just use the iPad 3.
[01:28:44.040 --> 01:28:45.480]   So that's what I do now.
[01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:47.400]   I figure it's bigger.
[01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:50.120]   So it's probably monitoring me better.
[01:28:50.120 --> 01:28:51.640]   But yeah, I don't know.
[01:28:51.640 --> 01:28:52.640]   Lightning accessories.
[01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:53.640]   It's a real bound to happen.
[01:28:53.640 --> 01:28:55.920]   I guess Koot is to Bilkin for being first.
[01:28:55.920 --> 01:28:56.920]   Yeah.
[01:28:56.920 --> 01:28:57.920]   Yeah.
[01:28:57.920 --> 01:29:00.400]   I mean, this is just this is the exciting thing.
[01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:04.880]   So this is the exciting opportunity to replace all the cables, adapters and power accessories
[01:29:04.880 --> 01:29:09.160]   that we're working just fine for their old phone with things that have to we have to buy
[01:29:09.160 --> 01:29:11.960]   now because we were decided to go buy the new iPhone 5.
[01:29:11.960 --> 01:29:14.480]   Oh, well, not that you're bitter.
[01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:15.480]   Not today.
[01:29:15.480 --> 01:29:16.480]   I'm bitter.
[01:29:16.480 --> 01:29:17.480]   Well, I came a little bit bitter.
[01:29:17.480 --> 01:29:18.480]   Okay.
[01:29:18.480 --> 01:29:19.480]   I'm a ceiling ball of bitterness.
[01:29:19.480 --> 01:29:23.560]   I am the ever ever lapsed in gobs, sock go go go go go go go stop or love lemon lemon
[01:29:23.560 --> 01:29:25.400]   hit ball of bitterness.
[01:29:25.400 --> 01:29:26.400]   It's awesome.
[01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:30.800]   I just got the car charger stuck the lightning cable in instead of the 30 pin dock connector
[01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:32.200]   cable and I was fine.
[01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:33.200]   Yeah.
[01:29:33.200 --> 01:29:39.120]   Well, you know, I had gotten a tip on on in one of our inboxes on another show from somebody
[01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:44.920]   who said during the hurricane during Sandy, I was totally out of power, but I did have
[01:29:44.920 --> 01:29:47.280]   a mophie case for my iPhone.
[01:29:47.280 --> 01:29:53.040]   Of course, there is no mophie case for the iPhone 5, but if you've got that 30 pin adapter,
[01:29:53.040 --> 01:29:57.680]   you plug that into the bottom of the mophie, you plug the iPhone 5 into the rest of it.
[01:29:57.680 --> 01:29:58.840]   Top won't work, but who cares?
[01:29:58.840 --> 01:30:00.440]   Because all you want is power, right?
[01:30:00.440 --> 01:30:01.440]   Works like a charm.
[01:30:01.440 --> 01:30:02.440]   I tried it out.
[01:30:02.440 --> 01:30:03.440]   She was right.
[01:30:03.440 --> 01:30:09.800]   So I like the whole hack thing until mophie iPhone 5 cases come out, which well, the iPhone
[01:30:09.800 --> 01:30:15.640]   cases that can actually be on top of the iPhone rather than being a separate little unit,
[01:30:15.640 --> 01:30:19.720]   which is we'll be sooner than later, but all right.
[01:30:19.720 --> 01:30:21.360]   Should we move on to what is it?
[01:30:21.360 --> 01:30:22.360]   Okay.
[01:30:22.360 --> 01:30:25.160]   One of us used path in this group.
[01:30:25.160 --> 01:30:26.160]   I use it.
[01:30:26.160 --> 01:30:31.000]   Alex, I think I had to stop being your friend because I came to 150 friends and you never
[01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:32.840]   used it.
[01:30:32.840 --> 01:30:35.800]   I stopped using it.
[01:30:35.800 --> 01:30:36.800]   Yeah.
[01:30:36.800 --> 01:30:38.400]   That's probably why.
[01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:40.000]   No, I was.
[01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:45.400]   So for a while, I was I got into path and I was like very interested in path.
[01:30:45.400 --> 01:30:48.840]   And then I just what's interesting about it was because it was so close that I started
[01:30:48.840 --> 01:30:52.800]   really put posting a lot of pictures of my kids and cool things.
[01:30:52.800 --> 01:30:55.360]   And then I just decided that that was not a thing that I should be doing.
[01:30:55.360 --> 01:30:58.560]   Like I just made this decision like I shouldn't be that personal about anything.
[01:30:58.560 --> 01:31:01.240]   And you know, it was just I don't know what it was.
[01:31:01.240 --> 01:31:03.680]   And so I just decided to stop doing that.
[01:31:03.680 --> 01:31:07.840]   I didn't like to get into the pattern of being public even in a private space.
[01:31:07.840 --> 01:31:10.840]   So that's that's why I stopped using path.
[01:31:10.840 --> 01:31:12.720]   And then I got you.
[01:31:12.720 --> 01:31:14.920]   Are you in the path?
[01:31:14.920 --> 01:31:15.920]   I love it.
[01:31:15.920 --> 01:31:19.000]   One of the coolest designed iOS apps I've ever seen.
[01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:22.880]   I mean, the user interface helmets they've built for this are just Apple.
[01:31:22.880 --> 01:31:27.160]   Please either buy these people out or steal it or discover they haven't patented these
[01:31:27.160 --> 01:31:31.400]   ideas and then steal them for iOS seven because they're such nice ideas.
[01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:36.000]   But I'm sort of with what I love the idea behind path, which is that there's there should
[01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:40.120]   be a really, really personal and private social network that you can maintain.
[01:31:40.120 --> 01:31:41.880]   That's just for a limited number of people.
[01:31:41.880 --> 01:31:46.560]   And I love it. Unfortunately, I was unable to convince the majority of the people that
[01:31:46.560 --> 01:31:50.720]   I do want to share personal photos with to actually use it.
[01:31:50.720 --> 01:31:52.480]   And so I still use it occasionally.
[01:31:52.480 --> 01:31:57.200]   And sometimes I'll do it to like my friends have to it, my friends that's kind of that
[01:31:57.200 --> 01:31:58.200]   kind of circle.
[01:31:58.200 --> 01:32:05.240]   But unfortunately, if I want my sisters to get that little warm fuzzy feeling knowing
[01:32:05.240 --> 01:32:11.400]   that you know, the happy Halloween poster that my dad bought 18 years ago that I that
[01:32:11.400 --> 01:32:14.280]   I took from the house, like when they close the house, while here it is hanging on the
[01:32:14.280 --> 01:32:16.040]   door, isn't that lovely?
[01:32:16.040 --> 01:32:20.120]   I have to go to Facebook to post that photo to them because that's the only thing that
[01:32:20.120 --> 01:32:22.120]   they will use.
[01:32:22.120 --> 01:32:23.200]   I know.
[01:32:23.200 --> 01:32:24.360]   I don't like it.
[01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:28.440]   But sometimes if you want to maintain relationships with your relatives, you have to actually do
[01:32:28.440 --> 01:32:30.960]   things you don't like such as post a photo to face.
[01:32:30.960 --> 01:32:32.840]   And you got to get through the holidays.
[01:32:32.840 --> 01:32:33.840]   Can't use path.
[01:32:33.840 --> 01:32:36.200]   Renee, what about you?
[01:32:36.200 --> 01:32:40.360]   I use path only whenever there's an update out and I have to write about it.
[01:32:40.360 --> 01:32:44.800]   But I'm sort of like, I barely use Facebook.
[01:32:44.800 --> 01:32:46.880]   I'm trying to force myself to use app.net.
[01:32:46.880 --> 01:32:50.960]   But I find Twitter is the perfect time commitment for me because I can quickly post something,
[01:32:50.960 --> 01:32:52.960]   quickly reply to something and get out.
[01:32:52.960 --> 01:32:56.240]   I find all at Google plus path Facebook.
[01:32:56.240 --> 01:32:59.400]   There's just too much time demand and I they're great buffers.
[01:32:59.400 --> 01:33:01.280]   My family can think that they're keeping in touch with me.
[01:33:01.280 --> 01:33:03.480]   I don't have to actually speak to them on the phone.
[01:33:03.480 --> 01:33:06.280]   But I don't I just don't use them that much.
[01:33:06.280 --> 01:33:11.800]   Well, the reason I bring up path is because they just rolled out an official iPad version,
[01:33:11.800 --> 01:33:16.640]   the iOS and Android versions and and Blackberry.
[01:33:16.640 --> 01:33:19.200]   I'm not sure maybe.
[01:33:19.200 --> 01:33:21.520]   Versions have been out for a while, but there was no iPad version.
[01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:25.240]   So if you wanted to run it on an iPad, you had to run it at 2x, which was not that big
[01:33:25.240 --> 01:33:26.240]   a deal.
[01:33:26.240 --> 01:33:28.240]   But will you bring me an iPad?
[01:33:28.240 --> 01:33:29.240]   Oh, thanks.
[01:33:29.240 --> 01:33:30.240]   Great.
[01:33:30.240 --> 01:33:31.240]   Okay.
[01:33:31.240 --> 01:33:32.240]   So this is this is Chad's path.
[01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:35.600]   I hope all of your friends don't mind that I'm showing them off.
[01:33:35.600 --> 01:33:37.200]   But we've got cute cats and stuff.
[01:33:37.200 --> 01:33:44.160]   So on this on this view, I'm doing this backwards, you've got your left hand rail, which anyone
[01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:47.720]   who's used the iPhone the the the radio app is familiar with.
[01:33:47.720 --> 01:33:53.600]   Of course, on my iPhone, this expands and contracts, then you've got, oh, there's me.
[01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:54.600]   I voted this morning.
[01:33:54.600 --> 01:33:55.600]   That was a picture that I took.
[01:33:55.600 --> 01:34:00.320]   I'll go ahead and be Chad and smile at that because, you know, I was pretty cool update.
[01:34:00.320 --> 01:34:04.040]   So this is all this all works pretty normally, right?
[01:34:04.040 --> 01:34:09.440]   It's a little irksome, I think to me, you know, just to be nitpicky about design that I would
[01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:17.160]   like the pictures, the feed itself to be full screen and be able to to to to hide all of
[01:34:17.160 --> 01:34:20.160]   my activity on the left side.
[01:34:20.160 --> 01:34:21.160]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:34:21.160 --> 01:34:25.360]   Just, you know, that that would I would like that, but whatever, it's not a huge deal.
[01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:28.280]   But then if I go into landscape mode, this is where it's supposed to be kind of new
[01:34:28.280 --> 01:34:29.560]   and cool, right?
[01:34:29.560 --> 01:34:35.560]   This is path, the iPad enabled version.
[01:34:35.560 --> 01:34:38.960]   So if someone checks in somewhere, now I see a map view of it.
[01:34:38.960 --> 01:34:41.200]   This was my photo from this morning.
[01:34:41.200 --> 01:34:46.280]   If I go ahead and click it, then you see what I said about it and where I was and who liked
[01:34:46.280 --> 01:34:48.320]   it and that sort of thing.
[01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:50.080]   But it's all sort of photo based.
[01:34:50.080 --> 01:34:51.960]   It doesn't look anything like path.
[01:34:51.960 --> 01:34:56.240]   And Andy, you mentioned up, have such a beautiful design and I agree with you, but I feel like
[01:34:56.240 --> 01:34:58.880]   this view is very weird.
[01:34:58.880 --> 01:35:05.360]   Why are some of these images so tiny when the map one is so big?
[01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:06.560]   It's kind of all over the place.
[01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:10.920]   And if I want to see, hey, what what what did some, you know, who's the latest person
[01:35:10.920 --> 01:35:14.720]   that maybe liked my voting picture, there's no way I can get there.
[01:35:14.720 --> 01:35:17.040]   I can't can't bring back that.
[01:35:17.040 --> 01:35:19.000]   I have to go back into portrait mode.
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:24.000]   I hate iPad apps that don't work the same way in landscape and portrait.
[01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:27.480]   I understand if they are designed to work one way or the other.
[01:35:27.480 --> 01:35:31.800]   But when they're specifically designed different ways, depending on how you're holding it,
[01:35:31.800 --> 01:35:32.800]   I hate that.
[01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:34.720]   It makes Johnny I've cry.
[01:35:34.720 --> 01:35:37.000]   Well, I am with him.
[01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:38.880]   I cry with Johnny.
[01:35:38.880 --> 01:35:42.800]   I think Andy was right when he said that they're doing a lot of innovative interface things.
[01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:46.800]   And you can see Apple starting to steal a little bit of that, for example, in the Yacht
[01:35:46.800 --> 01:35:50.920]   section of the maps app, you know, a little bit of the stretchy image parallax effect
[01:35:50.920 --> 01:35:54.080]   when you you get photos of restaurants or photos of locations.
[01:35:54.080 --> 01:35:59.600]   But I absolutely agree with you, the navigation in the iPad app is non obvious when you're
[01:35:59.600 --> 01:36:03.480]   in landscape view and it's not clear to me what they want you to look at or why.
[01:36:03.480 --> 01:36:07.320]   Hopefully they'll make the portrait view the default one in both.
[01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:08.320]   I hope so too.
[01:36:08.320 --> 01:36:13.120]   Maybe if I complain enough, I can get the path people to pay more attention.
[01:36:13.120 --> 01:36:20.160]   This was a really cool headline, at least, London to deploy 14,000 iPad controlled smart
[01:36:20.160 --> 01:36:23.160]   street lights over the next four years.
[01:36:23.160 --> 01:36:25.160]   It's like, wow, this is the future.
[01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:28.160]   It's not as exciting as it sounds.
[01:36:28.160 --> 01:36:33.560]   The details are that London's planning to upgrade the street lighting system in Westminster
[01:36:33.560 --> 01:36:40.240]   over the next four years and has committed to spending 3.25 pounds, duraling million,
[01:36:40.240 --> 01:36:46.200]   to replace 14,000 lights with new energy efficient versions, but that the lights will
[01:36:46.200 --> 01:36:51.200]   be controlled through iPad apps that workers will have access to.
[01:36:51.200 --> 01:36:53.520]   They're actually smart street lights.
[01:36:53.520 --> 01:36:55.760]   I'm holding my little iPad.
[01:36:55.760 --> 01:37:01.960]   iPad mini, probably, if I'm a worker because you know how extremely heavy and lucky those
[01:37:01.960 --> 01:37:08.320]   regular iPads are, I can see if something needs my assistance.
[01:37:08.320 --> 01:37:16.160]   The problem is that it still involves a cockney type character in a long scarf and a stove
[01:37:16.160 --> 01:37:22.160]   type pad, climbing a ladder to the top of the street and just tapping the iPad to it because
[01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:24.920]   there's some traditions that really shouldn't die.
[01:37:24.920 --> 01:37:28.000]   These are the start to the stories that are written out.
[01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:31.320]   It's face all, with with with with with candle black.
[01:37:31.320 --> 01:37:36.280]   You see the flower girl.
[01:37:36.280 --> 01:37:38.120]   I hope he has a good night.
[01:37:38.120 --> 01:37:42.240]   If she has a good night selling her flowers, she might be able to have a cold and not die
[01:37:42.240 --> 01:37:44.120]   in the parish in the evening.
[01:37:44.120 --> 01:37:45.360]   That sort of stuff.
[01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:50.720]   I added out these these you see these headlines all the time where it's like iPads will revolutionize
[01:37:50.720 --> 01:37:54.880]   the lighting grid and then you read it like what are they going to do over in Westminster.
[01:37:54.880 --> 01:37:59.360]   Oh, they just have like an iPad app that's running a program that somehow tied into opening
[01:37:59.360 --> 01:38:05.480]   up a website that right exactly because because we all know only a device like the iPad running
[01:38:05.480 --> 01:38:08.720]   an operating system like iOS could control a light.
[01:38:08.720 --> 01:38:12.640]   Magical and revolutionary as Gordon Ramsey blows by in his Lamborghini at 100 miles an
[01:38:12.640 --> 01:38:13.640]   hour.
[01:38:13.640 --> 01:38:14.640]   Exactly.
[01:38:14.640 --> 01:38:19.320]   I still want to ask me we were getting a new refrigerator for the office and they said
[01:38:19.320 --> 01:38:20.880]   what are the what are your requirements?
[01:38:20.880 --> 01:38:22.880]   I'm like I have to be able to run it with my iPhone.
[01:38:22.880 --> 01:38:26.880]   So far we haven't gotten a new refrigerator yet.
[01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:29.440]   It's like all sounds uncomfortable.
[01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:30.440]   Here is the power switch.
[01:38:30.440 --> 01:38:33.600]   You can if you whack it upwards with your iPhone, it turns off.
[01:38:33.600 --> 01:38:36.960]   If you whack it downwards with your iPhone in your hand, it turns off.
[01:38:36.960 --> 01:38:38.160]   That'll be a thousand dollars.
[01:38:38.160 --> 01:38:41.320]   When you get obsessed with it, you know, what was funny was that I was at CES last year
[01:38:41.320 --> 01:38:44.680]   and of course I walked up to like it was like a world pool and they were showing this crazy
[01:38:44.680 --> 01:38:48.640]   high tech washer and dryer and I was like, can I control it with my iPhone?
[01:38:48.640 --> 01:38:50.400]   And she's like next year.
[01:38:50.400 --> 01:38:54.400]   So you like and that I mean what I am interested.
[01:38:54.400 --> 01:38:58.240]   I thought I was throwing her a curve and turned out not so much.
[01:38:58.240 --> 01:39:04.280]   Well, Sony is entering a, you know, ebook market not crowded enough.
[01:39:04.280 --> 01:39:10.840]   Apparently Sony wants us to have access to books that we use Sony to purchase them through
[01:39:10.840 --> 01:39:11.840]   the new reader app.
[01:39:11.840 --> 01:39:17.400]   Andy, you were mentioning that you read a lot on tablets.
[01:39:17.400 --> 01:39:22.880]   Is this more compelling to you than any other ebook reading app that you might already know
[01:39:22.880 --> 01:39:24.560]   and love?
[01:39:24.560 --> 01:39:25.560]   Not really.
[01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:28.800]   I mean, they kind of just have to do it, huh?
[01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:34.240]   Yeah, it's publishers are offering licensing terms just by anybody because they let their
[01:39:34.240 --> 01:39:37.000]   model is to sell it to don't don't like exclusivity.
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.240]   They don't like giving one distributor a whole lot of power.
[01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:42.520]   So this is very, very much in the wheelhouse of every conventional publisher and every
[01:39:42.520 --> 01:39:44.120]   conventional packager.
[01:39:44.120 --> 01:39:48.360]   But as far as the consumers go, really, there's the Kindle app.
[01:39:48.360 --> 01:39:52.960]   There's the iBooks app, which is only has an advantage over Kindle in that it's preloaded.
[01:39:52.960 --> 01:39:53.960]   Excuse me.
[01:39:53.960 --> 01:39:57.760]   It's you're instantly asked to download it and it's sort of intimately connected to
[01:39:57.760 --> 01:39:59.000]   the iTunes store.
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.760]   And then any other store kind of has trouble getting traction.
[01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:06.640]   I mean, I myself was a little bit of a Kindle bigot up until about eight months to a year
[01:40:06.640 --> 01:40:07.640]   ago.
[01:40:07.640 --> 01:40:11.560]   But when the Google placed when Google like revamped their play store and started to
[01:40:11.560 --> 01:40:14.840]   tell people, Hey, look, how much look how much content I have.
[01:40:14.840 --> 01:40:16.880]   We have available for you.
[01:40:16.880 --> 01:40:20.440]   Really almost every book you could name that you would be interested in getting from Amazon
[01:40:20.440 --> 01:40:23.480]   or iBooks is also available through Google Play.
[01:40:23.480 --> 01:40:30.760]   And this is, as a matter of fact, the most open format you can possibly get Google Play.
[01:40:30.760 --> 01:40:35.040]   All their content is DRMed for their commercial books as you know, it's that's the plague you're
[01:40:35.040 --> 01:40:36.200]   not going to get rid of.
[01:40:36.200 --> 01:40:41.000]   But they do use an Adobe format that is at least platform agnostic.
[01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:46.560]   So you can buy reader apps that work with Adobe's DRM and move it from device to device
[01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:47.560]   to device.
[01:40:47.560 --> 01:40:52.400]   So you can put on your iPad, put it on your put on almost anything except for Kindle.
[01:40:52.400 --> 01:40:53.960]   But are people really aware of it?
[01:40:53.960 --> 01:40:55.840]   So that's the so I did get that press release.
[01:40:55.840 --> 01:41:00.400]   I did start looking at it when I when I when I got that information.
[01:41:00.400 --> 01:41:05.120]   And what I what what I wound up with at the end of the day was, why am I going to recommend
[01:41:05.120 --> 01:41:11.800]   people to go to the store they've never heard of when they have these two stores that are
[01:41:11.800 --> 01:41:12.960]   absolutely in your face.
[01:41:12.960 --> 01:41:16.040]   And you know, are still going to be in business in two or three years time.
[01:41:16.040 --> 01:41:22.840]   I guess if you already had a Sony, uh, e ink reader and, you know, maybe you got it as
[01:41:22.840 --> 01:41:23.840]   a gift.
[01:41:23.840 --> 01:41:26.160]   I have who knows that that's whatever you had.
[01:41:26.160 --> 01:41:32.360]   You have a very well intention, but not very tech savvy aunt who knows you like iPads and
[01:41:32.360 --> 01:41:33.360]   they bought you right.
[01:41:33.360 --> 01:41:36.720]   I guess I could read my books on my iPhone or something.
[01:41:36.720 --> 01:41:43.160]   Uh, Alex Renee, any interest in the Sony reader app for iOS?
[01:41:43.160 --> 01:41:46.360]   I'm not even interested in, I'm just not interested in text.
[01:41:46.360 --> 01:41:49.120]   So I mean, I mean, I'm interested in words.
[01:41:49.120 --> 01:41:54.680]   I mean, I read, I read stuff, I read seven small amounts, like flipboard, you know, that's
[01:41:54.680 --> 01:41:55.680]   about the most reading.
[01:41:55.680 --> 01:41:58.960]   But if I'm going to, if I'm going to read a long book, I'm going to listen to it or I'm
[01:41:58.960 --> 01:42:00.720]   going to want something more interactive.
[01:42:00.720 --> 01:42:04.840]   I mean, but the idea, I mean, I, I, so I think that all these reading formats are fine.
[01:42:04.840 --> 01:42:07.640]   I just think that they are going to slowly fade away.
[01:42:07.640 --> 01:42:13.560]   Well, the thing that I found interesting is Andy said that, you know, the.
[01:42:13.560 --> 01:42:17.160]   See, I was, I was just waiting for, I was waiting for Andy.
[01:42:17.160 --> 01:42:18.560]   I, that was a bait Andy.
[01:42:18.560 --> 01:42:22.760]   I was just baiting you set up because I've just tried to figure out when, when, when
[01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:25.840]   exactly was the epic of the epoch of the written word?
[01:42:25.840 --> 01:42:27.600]   Was that like 4,000 words?
[01:42:27.600 --> 01:42:33.760]   The years ago, 8,000 words ago, suddenly the, sorry, man.
[01:42:33.760 --> 01:42:34.920]   I don't think the iPad.
[01:42:34.920 --> 01:42:41.360]   I just think it's, I think it's, I think the, I think the, the idea of unit asking, you
[01:42:41.360 --> 01:42:46.360]   know, information, I think is, is something that, you know, it'll survive this century.
[01:42:46.360 --> 01:42:47.360]   Very much.
[01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:51.240]   You're very bearish on the concept of focusing on anything.
[01:42:51.240 --> 01:42:56.600]   No feel as though focusing on your tent and on something is a growth industry.
[01:42:56.600 --> 01:43:01.000]   Not only, not only am I ADD, I am, I am, I am defiantly ADD.
[01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:05.680]   See, that's the whole thing is that, is it, is it, I, I make fun of unit askers.
[01:43:05.680 --> 01:43:11.080]   Well, now they have those, there's two competing apps, at least in, in the, in the, in the
[01:43:11.080 --> 01:43:16.280]   App Store that are designed for people who's, who do not want to read several versions
[01:43:16.280 --> 01:43:17.280]   of a story.
[01:43:17.280 --> 01:43:18.280]   Right.
[01:43:18.280 --> 01:43:22.120]   So Alex, you're the perfect, um, they don't want to read several versions of the story.
[01:43:22.120 --> 01:43:24.600]   No, because who's got the time, right?
[01:43:24.600 --> 01:43:28.200]   You want a, some sort of succinct, give me my little blurb.
[01:43:28.200 --> 01:43:29.200]   I want the information.
[01:43:29.200 --> 01:43:32.920]   Now what's interesting about me is that, that I'm the exact opposite of that.
[01:43:32.920 --> 01:43:37.440]   Because what I want to see is, is, if there's a piece of news, I want to see what, I want
[01:43:37.440 --> 01:43:42.440]   to see what, uh, CNN, Al Jazeera, Fox News, like I want to see all of them have to say
[01:43:42.440 --> 01:43:46.960]   about the same things that I can triangulate what is actually might actually be occurring.
[01:43:46.960 --> 01:43:49.920]   You just want everyone to say it in very few words.
[01:43:49.920 --> 01:43:53.600]   Yeah, I just want them to be, I want them to be succinct.
[01:43:53.600 --> 01:43:58.160]   You know, from like, you open up something in flip board, you see 21 pages.
[01:43:58.160 --> 01:44:00.200]   You're like, I'm not going to read that.
[01:44:00.200 --> 01:44:06.160]   So I'm on my iPhone, every 21 pages and I'll be like, no, it really needs to be eight, eight,
[01:44:06.160 --> 01:44:09.360]   eight pages on, on an iPhone, on flip board is pretty much my limit.
[01:44:09.360 --> 01:44:12.160]   So yeah, I mean, Beethoven's ninth sympathy, it's not a symphony.
[01:44:12.160 --> 01:44:15.840]   It's not a bad symphony, but you know what, you really could get that down to about 18
[01:44:15.840 --> 01:44:16.840]   seconds.
[01:44:16.840 --> 01:44:17.840]   Cause a lot of it just repeats itself, doesn't it?
[01:44:17.840 --> 01:44:19.840]   You just had too many notes.
[01:44:19.840 --> 01:44:21.840]   There's just too many notes.
[01:44:21.840 --> 01:44:24.400]   That's absurd.
[01:44:24.400 --> 01:44:25.400]   There it is.
[01:44:25.400 --> 01:44:30.800]   One thing I find interesting about what Andy was saying about Sony is that Amazon often
[01:44:30.800 --> 01:44:37.120]   tout the number of exclusive titles they have like 150,000 titles as a competitive advantage
[01:44:37.120 --> 01:44:38.680]   for their ebook reader.
[01:44:38.680 --> 01:44:42.920]   And I wonder if someone like Sony would have to have really hot, really exclusive, almost
[01:44:42.920 --> 01:44:47.720]   like platform exclusives in the video game era to try to swing some momentum their way.
[01:44:47.720 --> 01:44:52.520]   I know for example, I bought Planet Hulk on iBooks, but I had to buy Dark Knight on Kindle
[01:44:52.520 --> 01:44:53.960]   because they just didn't have it there.
[01:44:53.960 --> 01:44:58.040]   And that's the only reason why I use, I have more than one book app right now.
[01:44:58.040 --> 01:45:02.640]   So unless there's a compelling content reason to go to Sony, I don't see them going very
[01:45:02.640 --> 01:45:03.800]   far at all.
[01:45:03.800 --> 01:45:07.280]   There is a lot of fudge in that number because when they say the number of titles that are
[01:45:07.280 --> 01:45:11.160]   exclusive to Kindle, they're not talking about the New York Times bestseller.
[01:45:11.160 --> 01:45:16.440]   They're talking about some English lit majors, unfinished grad student thesis project that
[01:45:16.440 --> 01:45:22.200]   they said, oh, you mean that I can, by downloading this free app, I can turn this 800 page monstrosity
[01:45:22.200 --> 01:45:24.760]   into a book on the store and I can get money for it?
[01:45:24.760 --> 01:45:25.760]   Great.
[01:45:25.760 --> 01:45:26.760]   All right.
[01:45:26.760 --> 01:45:29.160]   Well, we've got some picks of the week.
[01:45:29.160 --> 01:45:31.640]   Renee, are you also a weekly picker?
[01:45:31.640 --> 01:45:33.200]   I know you're good.
[01:45:33.200 --> 01:45:34.200]   Good, good.
[01:45:34.200 --> 01:45:36.320]   So, so we'll have some picks.
[01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:37.720]   We do have one more break to take.
[01:45:37.720 --> 01:45:41.640]   Everybody could just have a little water and kind of regain their strength.
[01:45:41.640 --> 01:45:43.640]   And for that, we will kick it over to Leola Port.
[01:45:43.640 --> 01:45:44.640]   All right.
[01:45:44.640 --> 01:45:46.560]   We've got the new iPad mini.
[01:45:46.560 --> 01:45:47.880]   That's pretty sweet.
[01:45:47.880 --> 01:45:52.760]   Maybe you want a new iPad, take that iPad 3 and send it back and get the new iPad.
[01:45:52.760 --> 01:45:55.480]   The problem with keeping up to date and gadgets is the great cost.
[01:45:55.480 --> 01:45:58.640]   That's why I really love gazelle.com.
[01:45:58.640 --> 01:46:00.160]   Have you used gazelle?
[01:46:00.160 --> 01:46:01.440]   We've certainly talked about it enough.
[01:46:01.440 --> 01:46:06.560]   This is the place where you can go to sell your used gadgets, get cash to buy the newest
[01:46:06.560 --> 01:46:07.920]   latest and greatest.
[01:46:07.920 --> 01:46:10.440]   You know, gazelle used to do a bunch of different products.
[01:46:10.440 --> 01:46:12.440]   They realized this is what people really want.
[01:46:12.440 --> 01:46:13.440]   iPhone.
[01:46:13.440 --> 01:46:20.800]   iPad, iPod, MacBook, Mac mini or iMac or MacBook Pro.
[01:46:20.800 --> 01:46:26.920]   And they do take cell phones, the old BlackBerry rim or HTC LG Motorola or Nokia.
[01:46:26.920 --> 01:46:34.320]   Let's say you've got a Samsung unlocked Galaxy S3, which I happen to have, lying around the
[01:46:34.320 --> 01:46:35.760]   house and I'd like to get rid of it.
[01:46:35.760 --> 01:46:37.120]   It's in great condition.
[01:46:37.120 --> 01:46:44.240]   Now, I could just throw it away or I could just more likely throw it in a drawer and this way,
[01:46:44.240 --> 01:46:48.400]   I get cash for it so I can buy it, throw it in the box.
[01:46:48.400 --> 01:46:49.840]   Let's take a look at an iPhone.
[01:46:49.840 --> 01:46:50.840]   Well, I know.
[01:46:50.840 --> 01:46:51.840]   Maybe you want to get the new iPad.
[01:46:51.840 --> 01:46:53.320]   That was the example I used.
[01:46:53.320 --> 01:46:59.560]   You've got your third generation iPad and you say, "I'm ready to trade this in $495."
[01:46:59.560 --> 01:47:00.560]   Wow.
[01:47:00.560 --> 01:47:02.320]   Now, throw that in the box.
[01:47:02.320 --> 01:47:04.440]   You go through all your old stuff.
[01:47:04.440 --> 01:47:10.160]   They pay the postage on anything worth more than a buck and you get new stuff or cash if
[01:47:10.160 --> 01:47:11.160]   you want.
[01:47:11.160 --> 01:47:12.960]   Here's what happens.
[01:47:12.960 --> 01:47:16.000]   Their specialists will remove your data from it.
[01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.040]   You don't have to worry about that.
[01:47:18.040 --> 01:47:24.280]   And then they will send you either a check, a PayPal credit or, and this is the pro tip
[01:47:24.280 --> 01:47:28.960]   if you buy a lot of stuff from Amazon, get that Amazon gift card because there's a additional
[01:47:28.960 --> 01:47:31.640]   5% added to it.
[01:47:31.640 --> 01:47:33.360]   So that's a really good deal.
[01:47:33.360 --> 01:47:38.920]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E, Gazelle.com.
[01:47:38.920 --> 01:47:43.000]   Was time to move on and get the newest gadget.
[01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:44.560]   Don't fill up the landfill.
[01:47:44.560 --> 01:47:45.880]   Don't throw it in a drawer.
[01:47:45.880 --> 01:47:47.720]   Go to Gazelle.
[01:47:47.720 --> 01:47:48.720]   Pass it along.
[01:47:48.720 --> 01:47:50.400]   Recycle the easy way.
[01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:51.760]   Gazelle.com.
[01:47:51.760 --> 01:47:54.400]   Thanks, Leo.
[01:47:54.400 --> 01:47:58.840]   Hey, so we're at the picks of the weeks part of the show and I have mine.
[01:47:58.840 --> 01:48:00.800]   I'm very excited.
[01:48:00.800 --> 01:48:03.000]   So we ever go in a particular order.
[01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.080]   Renee, do you want to go first?
[01:48:05.080 --> 01:48:06.080]   Sure.
[01:48:06.080 --> 01:48:07.920]   Do you want to go last?
[01:48:07.920 --> 01:48:08.920]   I'm good to go.
[01:48:08.920 --> 01:48:09.920]   Okay.
[01:48:09.920 --> 01:48:10.920]   All right.
[01:48:10.920 --> 01:48:11.920]   We're starting on the edge.
[01:48:11.920 --> 01:48:14.160]   Renee Richie, what is your weekly Mac break pick?
[01:48:14.160 --> 01:48:18.040]   My pick of the week and I have to confess upfront that it's made by a friend of mine.
[01:48:18.040 --> 01:48:20.720]   So I'm a little bit biased, but it's a fantastic app.
[01:48:20.720 --> 01:48:23.640]   It's the new iStat 2 for iOS.
[01:48:23.640 --> 01:48:28.840]   It's made by Bajango who did iStat menu and the old iStat dashboard widget and they've
[01:48:28.840 --> 01:48:30.920]   just completely updated their app.
[01:48:30.920 --> 01:48:35.240]   So the idea is it can tell you everything that's going on with your phone, with your
[01:48:35.240 --> 01:48:40.760]   iPhone, your iPad, but you can also run the iStat server app on your Mac or Windows and
[01:48:40.760 --> 01:48:42.680]   there's even an open source Linux version.
[01:48:42.680 --> 01:48:48.280]   So you can be sitting by the pool side, umbrella, drink in hand, keeping an eye on all your
[01:48:48.280 --> 01:48:51.160]   computers back in the server room.
[01:48:51.160 --> 01:48:53.000]   You know whether you have to worry about them or not.
[01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:58.520]   I use them for my Mac Pro in my other room and I use it for my MacBook Pro if I'm not
[01:48:58.520 --> 01:48:59.520]   there.
[01:48:59.520 --> 01:49:06.360]   It's a very nerdy, very geeky, very IT administrator kind of app, but it's a phenomenal amount
[01:49:06.360 --> 01:49:07.360]   of detail.
[01:49:07.360 --> 01:49:10.840]   You can tap on a lot of stuff and get even more information about it and on the Mac you
[01:49:10.840 --> 01:49:16.160]   can even go back six months or a year and give you all the stats for your machine.
[01:49:16.160 --> 01:49:19.320]   So I've been using it quite a lot in the last week.
[01:49:19.320 --> 01:49:22.040]   499, Renee Richie loves it.
[01:49:22.040 --> 01:49:27.520]   iStat 2 is the name for iPhone and iPad.
[01:49:27.520 --> 01:49:29.680]   And iPad mini now too.
[01:49:29.680 --> 01:49:33.960]   And iPad mini as well because of course anything you can do on a big, all heavy iPad, you can
[01:49:33.960 --> 01:49:35.800]   do on the mini as well.
[01:49:35.800 --> 01:49:40.160]   Alex Lindsey, do you have one thing to say about iStat is probably one of the first apps
[01:49:40.160 --> 01:49:46.440]   that I install on any new machine that I have that I'm working on is iStat menu is because
[01:49:46.440 --> 01:49:48.120]   I need to know what's going on.
[01:49:48.120 --> 01:49:51.240]   So iStat menu is also a great one in that family.
[01:49:51.240 --> 01:49:57.080]   So as far as my recommendations, so as many people may have guessed, I travel a lot.
[01:49:57.080 --> 01:50:02.520]   And as a result, I have become very, very sensitive to bags.
[01:50:02.520 --> 01:50:05.040]   So I thought, you know, that hold my Mac stuff.
[01:50:05.040 --> 01:50:07.000]   And so I just got a new bag for a long time.
[01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:13.280]   I was using a CATA 467i and they redesigned it in a way that I did not appreciate.
[01:50:13.280 --> 01:50:16.720]   So so first I bought a whole bunch of their old ones so that we wouldn't run out of them
[01:50:16.720 --> 01:50:18.000]   because we stock up stuff.
[01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:19.240]   And then I finally found another one.
[01:50:19.240 --> 01:50:22.880]   I was at REI over the last couple days and I found this bag.
[01:50:22.880 --> 01:50:24.320]   It's very much like it.
[01:50:24.320 --> 01:50:27.320]   This is a mountain Smith bag and I think they're camera.
[01:50:27.320 --> 01:50:29.920]   Camera, camera vintage or something like that.
[01:50:29.920 --> 01:50:33.960]   But anyway, so this is made by mountain Smith, which I wouldn't expect.
[01:50:33.960 --> 01:50:35.960]   I wouldn't usually get a bag for mountain Smith.
[01:50:35.960 --> 01:50:40.960]   I mean, I just for cameras or whatever, I'd get it for hiking or something like that.
[01:50:40.960 --> 01:50:45.040]   Very much similar to the 467 where you've got three little compartments down here.
[01:50:45.040 --> 01:50:48.240]   I put all kinds of cameras and video stuff down here.
[01:50:48.240 --> 01:50:51.720]   It's great bag, great pocket selection.
[01:50:51.720 --> 01:50:56.560]   So you have a nice little area up front here that I can put things like my Wi-Fi card,
[01:50:56.560 --> 01:51:01.600]   but also a nice water protected area here as well as some areas where I keep little
[01:51:01.600 --> 01:51:07.240]   batteries that no longer will work with my iPhone 5 soon, which would be a big one.
[01:51:07.240 --> 01:51:10.760]   The nice big open container, I'll talk about that in a second, but this is a big open
[01:51:10.760 --> 01:51:11.760]   container.
[01:51:11.760 --> 01:51:12.760]   You can put a lot of stuff in.
[01:51:12.760 --> 01:51:15.440]   You can really create a big mess this way, but I'll show you how we fix that.
[01:51:15.440 --> 01:51:18.000]   And then also they've got two laptop.
[01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:19.440]   It's actually got a little separator in the center.
[01:51:19.440 --> 01:51:22.680]   So you can have two laptops, which I normally have.
[01:51:22.680 --> 01:51:26.000]   So anyway, so that it's a great bag.
[01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:27.000]   It's about 120 bucks.
[01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.160]   Yeah, there you go.
[01:51:29.160 --> 01:51:34.120]   And it actually is bigger than this 467 internally, I think, which makes it a little
[01:51:34.120 --> 01:51:35.120]   harder to get under the seat.
[01:51:35.120 --> 01:51:38.040]   You have to kick it a little harder when you push it under the seat, but it's great
[01:51:38.040 --> 01:51:39.040]   bag there.
[01:51:39.040 --> 01:51:43.920]   Now, that big area on the top is also a problem because if you start putting cables in there,
[01:51:43.920 --> 01:51:46.160]   you'll never find anything because it's too big.
[01:51:46.160 --> 01:51:49.840]   You got to always figure out a way to subdivide your big space.
[01:51:49.840 --> 01:51:53.080]   I know that I'm getting a little crazy about the packing stuff.
[01:51:53.080 --> 01:51:56.440]   But anyway, so turns out, Container Store makes these little guys here.
[01:51:56.440 --> 01:51:58.840]   Now, these are for the guys.
[01:51:58.840 --> 01:52:01.120]   You'll never find these because these are cosmetic bags.
[01:52:01.120 --> 01:52:02.120]   They try to help.
[01:52:02.120 --> 01:52:05.160]   I was going to say, you know, that looks curiously like what I put my makeup brushes
[01:52:05.160 --> 01:52:06.160]   into.
[01:52:06.160 --> 01:52:07.160]   Yes, it is.
[01:52:07.160 --> 01:52:12.360]   But let me tell you, they are so useful when it comes to putting cables in the right order.
[01:52:12.360 --> 01:52:14.400]   So these are micro mesh bags.
[01:52:14.400 --> 01:52:15.800]   And you can see what's in them.
[01:52:15.800 --> 01:52:20.120]   You can see what kind of trouble you're getting yourself into without actually having to dig
[01:52:20.120 --> 01:52:21.120]   through them.
[01:52:21.120 --> 01:52:24.240]   So anything is opaque is really not your friend because you can't figure out what you actually
[01:52:24.240 --> 01:52:25.240]   pack.
[01:52:25.240 --> 01:52:26.400]   So for instance, I speak a lot.
[01:52:26.400 --> 01:52:32.840]   And so these are like every adapter that I could possibly need to connect to a projector.
[01:52:32.840 --> 01:52:36.080]   So I've got one little bag that just does that.
[01:52:36.080 --> 01:52:38.600]   And then this is just general data cables and stuff like that.
[01:52:38.600 --> 01:52:41.880]   So I have a host of these little guys here and they're micro mesh bags.
[01:52:41.880 --> 01:52:42.880]   They're super cheap.
[01:52:42.880 --> 01:52:44.240]   They're like $6, $6, $7.
[01:52:44.240 --> 01:52:45.240]   They're at the Container Store.
[01:52:45.240 --> 01:52:47.840]   I don't know if you can order them online from the Container Store.
[01:52:47.840 --> 01:52:52.240]   I think the Container Store makes them, or well, some Chinese company makes them in Container
[01:52:52.240 --> 01:52:53.400]   Store, sells them.
[01:52:53.400 --> 01:52:56.200]   But they're little metal bags and they're really great.
[01:52:56.200 --> 01:52:57.920]   And I like them a lot.
[01:52:57.920 --> 01:52:59.040]   But yeah, they're cosmetic bags.
[01:52:59.040 --> 01:53:03.880]   So you have to get over that if you're a guy, well, some guys.
[01:53:03.880 --> 01:53:08.600]   And anyway, but they're really the bomb when it comes to keeping track of all your stuff
[01:53:08.600 --> 01:53:11.920]   and making sure that you're not going through the airport looking like an idiot.
[01:53:11.920 --> 01:53:12.920]   That's great too.
[01:53:12.920 --> 01:53:15.440]   $6 or $7, too.
[01:53:15.440 --> 01:53:18.880]   I haven't looked lately, but a variety of drugstores.
[01:53:18.880 --> 01:53:23.120]   I mean, the Walgreens down the street for me has stuff that's like that.
[01:53:23.120 --> 01:53:26.960]   Maybe not as nice of quality, but probably is only a couple of dollars.
[01:53:26.960 --> 01:53:28.880]   So that's really good for cable management.
[01:53:28.880 --> 01:53:30.800]   Certainly device management too.
[01:53:30.800 --> 01:53:31.800]   That's it.
[01:53:31.800 --> 01:53:32.800]   Thanks, Alex.
[01:53:32.800 --> 01:53:35.400]   Andy, let's kick it over to you.
[01:53:35.400 --> 01:53:37.200]   Do you have a pick?
[01:53:37.200 --> 01:53:40.320]   Yes, I do.
[01:53:40.320 --> 01:53:44.440]   I've always been disappointed with the design of the built of the iPhones built in music
[01:53:44.440 --> 01:53:46.640]   player app because it's functional.
[01:53:46.640 --> 01:53:52.040]   It works, but it just doesn't look like this product of a company that designed the iPod.
[01:53:52.040 --> 01:53:54.360]   It's just it's just very, very.
[01:53:54.360 --> 01:53:56.520]   It's not much to it.
[01:53:56.520 --> 01:53:58.480]   It doesn't do its job really, really very well.
[01:53:58.480 --> 01:54:00.600]   It does it OK, but it doesn't do it very well.
[01:54:00.600 --> 01:54:01.600]   This is an app.
[01:54:01.600 --> 01:54:05.240]   But I've just found an app called Track 8 by Ender Labs.
[01:54:05.240 --> 01:54:07.560]   It's on the iTunes store for Buck 99.
[01:54:07.560 --> 01:54:09.960]   That does nothing more complicated.
[01:54:09.960 --> 01:54:11.960]   Dang, why is this pixelated again?
[01:54:11.960 --> 01:54:12.960]   Hang on.
[01:54:12.960 --> 01:54:15.480]   Hey, give up.
[01:54:15.480 --> 01:54:21.720]   That does nothing more complicated than simply build, bring like the windows, phone, metro
[01:54:21.720 --> 01:54:28.640]   style music player to iOS and everything you got here, everything you get in Metro is right
[01:54:28.640 --> 01:54:29.640]   here.
[01:54:29.640 --> 01:54:33.760]   So you get this like side scrolling really cool interface that there we go.
[01:54:33.760 --> 01:54:34.760]   I've got it.
[01:54:34.760 --> 01:54:35.760]   I've got it up here.
[01:54:35.760 --> 01:54:39.840]   You can just by swiping left to right, go through all your different categories here.
[01:54:39.840 --> 01:54:45.160]   Here is the most my most played music and you can now can scroll up and down and see
[01:54:45.160 --> 01:54:47.040]   all the album mark of the albums I've been listening to.
[01:54:47.040 --> 01:54:48.320]   So here's Diana Domrow.
[01:54:48.320 --> 01:54:49.320]   I can tap that.
[01:54:49.320 --> 01:54:51.720]   And now I'm looking at a scrolling list.
[01:54:51.720 --> 01:54:52.720]   And hey, look at that.
[01:54:52.720 --> 01:54:57.720]   It understands that sometimes music album and track titles are too wide.
[01:54:57.720 --> 01:54:59.920]   And so we'll just simply scroll them automatically.
[01:54:59.920 --> 01:55:05.080]   And so if I just tap one and now I'm looking at this really pretty music player.
[01:55:05.080 --> 01:55:11.320]   So I just found this fairly recently and unfortunately it's completely it's now completely displaced
[01:55:11.320 --> 01:55:17.920]   the built in music player app because it does pretty much everything that the existing music
[01:55:17.920 --> 01:55:18.920]   player does.
[01:55:18.920 --> 01:55:22.000]   You can't create new playlists with it unfortunately.
[01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:26.840]   But as far as just as a playback mechanism, much prettier, much tidier, much easier to
[01:55:26.840 --> 01:55:28.960]   navigate through, I think.
[01:55:28.960 --> 01:55:32.880]   And another example of, oh, Apple, please, please, please, please, please, please steal
[01:55:32.880 --> 01:55:38.520]   some ideas from here or at least use that as encouragement to rethink how you've got
[01:55:38.520 --> 01:55:39.760]   your music player app working.
[01:55:39.760 --> 01:55:40.760]   I mean, look at that.
[01:55:40.760 --> 01:55:43.080]   So easy to find what you're looking for.
[01:55:43.080 --> 01:55:47.200]   And there's no reason why you can't develop an app that isn't both effective and also
[01:55:47.200 --> 01:55:50.240]   has a little bit of a style to it, right?
[01:55:50.240 --> 01:55:56.640]   So instead of just these stupid or these simple vertically scrolling lists of plain text that
[01:55:56.640 --> 01:55:59.640]   really doesn't help you discover the music that you have.
[01:55:59.640 --> 01:56:01.840]   So yeah, that's exactly what I did, at least on my iPhone.
[01:56:01.840 --> 01:56:04.360]   I kind of replaced the standard player with this.
[01:56:04.360 --> 01:56:05.360]   I love it.
[01:56:05.360 --> 01:56:06.360]   I think it looks great.
[01:56:06.360 --> 01:56:11.320]   I actually showed this to Leo, an iPad version sometime back, or maybe it's the iPhone version
[01:56:11.320 --> 01:56:12.400]   it was blown up.
[01:56:12.400 --> 01:56:13.720]   I don't remember if it's universal or not.
[01:56:13.720 --> 01:56:19.360]   And he goes, yeah, but who's going to want something that looks like Metro on an and
[01:56:19.360 --> 01:56:20.360]   an iDevice?
[01:56:20.360 --> 01:56:23.280]   And I was like, I don't think anybody has a problem with that, do they?
[01:56:23.280 --> 01:56:26.440]   I mean, as long as your music looks nicer.
[01:56:26.440 --> 01:56:29.840]   If nothing else, it'll give you an idea of why so many people are kind of excited about
[01:56:29.840 --> 01:56:34.360]   what the Windows 8 interface is, the Metro interface is like, or the, what they're not
[01:56:34.360 --> 01:56:38.400]   calling the modern interface is like, you can see that's a very flexible way of putting
[01:56:38.400 --> 01:56:42.000]   a lot of information on a tiny screen.
[01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.880]   And it's pretty, it's functional, it's fast and it's very, very flexible.
[01:56:44.880 --> 01:56:45.880]   So I like a lot.
[01:56:45.880 --> 01:56:46.880]   Buck 99.
[01:56:46.880 --> 01:56:47.880]   Buck 99.
[01:56:47.880 --> 01:56:48.880]   All right.
[01:56:48.880 --> 01:56:50.400]   Well, we've come to my tip.
[01:56:50.400 --> 01:56:55.360]   My tip is, I guess it's sort of how to have fun if you want to play a really fun little
[01:56:55.360 --> 01:56:56.360]   game.
[01:56:56.360 --> 01:57:04.080]   This actually comes from, it's the very first iOS app out of Amazon's Amazon Game Studios.
[01:57:04.080 --> 01:57:06.320]   I think that's the name of it.
[01:57:06.320 --> 01:57:12.160]   Developed with another company, but Amazon is putting games into the app store.
[01:57:12.160 --> 01:57:14.160]   This is called Air Patriots.
[01:57:14.160 --> 01:57:18.600]   I've actually already talked about this on i5 for the iPhone this week, but it's really
[01:57:18.600 --> 01:57:21.920]   fun and it's not hard to play.
[01:57:21.920 --> 01:57:27.280]   That's why I figure it would appeal to a lot of folks and I'll just try to turn on the
[01:57:27.280 --> 01:57:28.480]   volume as much as possible.
[01:57:28.480 --> 01:57:32.360]   But it's not so necessary for you to listen to it.
[01:57:32.360 --> 01:57:35.000]   What's more important is how the strategy works.
[01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:40.520]   And what's cool is that it is pretty much drag and place your planes in a variety of
[01:57:40.520 --> 01:57:48.560]   places around our battlefield here so that they fly directly over the tanks below and
[01:57:48.560 --> 01:57:49.720]   blow them up.
[01:57:49.720 --> 01:57:50.720]   That is pretty much it.
[01:57:50.720 --> 01:57:51.960]   I even have audio here.
[01:57:51.960 --> 01:57:53.840]   This is going to be really loud probably.
[01:57:53.840 --> 01:57:58.920]   I'm still trying to remember that I have my audio jack on the bottom of the iPhone.
[01:57:58.920 --> 01:58:01.160]   So I am flying all over the place here.
[01:58:01.160 --> 01:58:03.560]   I've got a couple different planes because I've leveled up.
[01:58:03.560 --> 01:58:07.280]   You start off with just one plane and the tanks are going by really slowly and you sort
[01:58:07.280 --> 01:58:10.160]   of think, gosh, this is almost like a game for babies.
[01:58:10.160 --> 01:58:11.360]   It's not hard at all.
[01:58:11.360 --> 01:58:13.760]   But of course it gets a lot more complicated.
[01:58:13.760 --> 01:58:16.040]   You have a variety of different weapons.
[01:58:16.040 --> 01:58:20.640]   You have a certain amount of lifeline that you need to take into consideration or you
[01:58:20.640 --> 01:58:22.000]   will lose.
[01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:23.440]   And the tanks keep coming.
[01:58:23.440 --> 01:58:28.880]   Some of them have little shields so that they won't just blow up once.
[01:58:28.880 --> 01:58:31.600]   You've got to go over them a few times.
[01:58:31.600 --> 01:58:36.680]   What's confusing and a little frustrating about these planes is that they don't go
[01:58:36.680 --> 01:58:38.200]   that fast.
[01:58:38.200 --> 01:58:46.760]   So you are sort of navigating around your battlefield and trying to stay on course.
[01:58:46.760 --> 01:58:51.320]   But it's almost like a game of centipede.
[01:58:51.320 --> 01:58:54.800]   It's like the tanks start coming and there's too many of them and they're too low and
[01:58:54.800 --> 01:58:56.680]   how are you ever going to get through it.
[01:58:56.680 --> 01:59:00.800]   So I'm on some pro level that I can't seem to get past now.
[01:59:00.800 --> 01:59:05.560]   But I figure for most folks, I'm not a huge gamer.
[01:59:05.560 --> 01:59:08.160]   I play games and I get frustrated and I don't want to play games.
[01:59:08.160 --> 01:59:09.160]   I play them anymore.
[01:59:09.160 --> 01:59:11.560]   And I'm kind of into this right now.
[01:59:11.560 --> 01:59:12.560]   And it's free.
[01:59:12.560 --> 01:59:15.040]   So it doesn't cost you a dime, which is also nice.
[01:59:15.040 --> 01:59:19.760]   So the next time you're trying to lose away some time at the airport or something like
[01:59:19.760 --> 01:59:25.840]   that and you want to give Amazon Game Studios a try and see how their game looks.
[01:59:25.840 --> 01:59:27.360]   And by the way, it's really nice.
[01:59:27.360 --> 01:59:30.800]   It's kind of hard to tell that this is this beautiful optimized for retina things.
[01:59:30.800 --> 01:59:31.800]   See, look at all these tanks.
[01:59:31.800 --> 01:59:32.800]   I'm so screwed.
[01:59:32.800 --> 01:59:35.160]   I'm not going to be around much longer.
[01:59:35.160 --> 01:59:37.000]   This is a good pick.
[01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:41.680]   So that's Air Patriots again from Amazon Game Studios.
[01:59:41.680 --> 01:59:47.120]   Probably the first of many Amazon games we'll see if it stays popular.
[01:59:47.120 --> 01:59:49.720]   I know it's popular now.
[01:59:49.720 --> 01:59:50.880]   Any of you guys played this before?
[01:59:50.880 --> 01:59:52.320]   Is it just me?
[01:59:52.320 --> 01:59:53.320]   Never.
[01:59:53.320 --> 01:59:54.320]   No.
[01:59:54.320 --> 01:59:55.320]   Have not.
[01:59:55.320 --> 01:59:56.320]   No.
[01:59:56.320 --> 01:59:58.720]   Well, I guess I'm the only one who knows how to have fun around here.
[01:59:58.720 --> 01:59:59.920]   That's fine too.
[01:59:59.920 --> 02:00:02.720]   Maybe the only one who likes to glorify war.
[02:00:02.720 --> 02:00:03.720]   That's right.
[02:00:03.720 --> 02:00:04.720]   Yeah, shoot them up.
[02:00:04.720 --> 02:00:05.720]   Not friendly.
[02:00:05.720 --> 02:00:08.720]   You heal the planet instead of trying to destroy it.
[02:00:08.720 --> 02:00:10.320]   But I'm destroying the bad guys.
[02:00:10.320 --> 02:00:11.320]   Come on.
[02:00:11.320 --> 02:00:12.320]   I'm a good plane.
[02:00:12.320 --> 02:00:13.320]   I'm a happy plane.
[02:00:13.320 --> 02:00:14.560]   Even the bad guys have mothers.
[02:00:14.560 --> 02:00:16.200]   That's well.
[02:00:16.200 --> 02:00:17.960]   What if the tanks are bad?
[02:00:17.960 --> 02:00:19.960]   The tanks could be driven by robots.
[02:00:19.960 --> 02:00:21.960]   We don't know what's happening down there.
[02:00:21.960 --> 02:00:22.960]   Oh, great.
[02:00:22.960 --> 02:00:26.080]   So devices that are programmed just to kill without remorse.
[02:00:26.080 --> 02:00:31.240]   Why don't you just stop digging your own little pit here?
[02:00:31.240 --> 02:00:33.240]   Do you notice in field runners now?
[02:00:33.240 --> 02:00:37.400]   In the field runners too, how much energy they spent making sure that you're clear that
[02:00:37.400 --> 02:00:43.000]   what you're killing are clones and not individual field runners.
[02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:45.440]   It was not clear in the first one.
[02:00:45.440 --> 02:00:48.280]   In the new one, it's very, very clear.
[02:00:48.280 --> 02:00:51.240]   No non clones were harmed in the making of this game.
[02:00:51.240 --> 02:00:52.240]   Exactly.
[02:00:52.240 --> 02:00:53.240]   Exactly.
[02:00:53.240 --> 02:00:54.800]   I'm still all my time is taken up with letter press.
[02:00:54.800 --> 02:00:56.360]   I haven't had any time for new games yet.
[02:00:56.360 --> 02:00:58.240]   The thing is just controlling my soul.
[02:00:58.240 --> 02:01:03.200]   Well, you know, Renee, I should say Renee and I are game center friends.
[02:01:03.200 --> 02:01:04.200]   We are playing.
[02:01:04.200 --> 02:01:05.440]   Are we still playing the game?
[02:01:05.440 --> 02:01:06.440]   Yes.
[02:01:06.440 --> 02:01:11.960]   See, we're almost at like a weird chess stalemate thing going on here right now because Renee
[02:01:11.960 --> 02:01:16.800]   is very good at letter press and he's figured out a way to corner me and he knows that if
[02:01:16.800 --> 02:01:21.760]   I just make one little move, I open the door for him to finish the game.
[02:01:21.760 --> 02:01:23.080]   But I can't finish you.
[02:01:23.080 --> 02:01:24.520]   You're you're spry enough to stay out of the way.
[02:01:24.520 --> 02:01:25.520]   You can't exactly.
[02:01:25.520 --> 02:01:27.320]   It's like I'm not going to beat you.
[02:01:27.320 --> 02:01:29.440]   I just keep dodging your bullets.
[02:01:29.440 --> 02:01:31.440]   So it's a rocky one or is it.
[02:01:31.440 --> 02:01:32.440]   We don't know.
[02:01:32.440 --> 02:01:35.360]   Oh, gosh, it's very, very addicting letter pressure.
[02:01:35.360 --> 02:01:40.000]   Probably should have been my pick, but I'm sure you guys have talked about that to death
[02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:41.560]   on previous episodes.
[02:01:41.560 --> 02:01:43.960]   But hey, speaking of this episode, we've gone almost two hours.
[02:01:43.960 --> 02:01:46.960]   So I guess it's time to wrap up this episode.
[02:01:46.960 --> 02:01:51.440]   Keep those pledges coming in for an hour or two of the.
[02:01:51.440 --> 02:01:53.440]   Yeah, this was nice.
[02:01:53.440 --> 02:01:57.320]   What will we episode 324 of Mac break weekly?
[02:01:57.320 --> 02:02:02.600]   What is it that Leo says who wants to play the Leo?
[02:02:02.600 --> 02:02:03.600]   That brick is over.
[02:02:03.600 --> 02:02:04.600]   Get back to work.
[02:02:04.600 --> 02:02:05.600]   You're gold bricks.
[02:02:05.600 --> 02:02:14.240]   Oh, gold bricks or old bricks play about brains on the company resources.
[02:02:14.240 --> 02:02:17.040]   You got a review coming up in three weeks.
[02:02:17.040 --> 02:02:19.640]   I would be leaning on that shovel if I was you.
[02:02:19.640 --> 02:02:21.760]   We're going to make some changes around here.
[02:02:21.760 --> 02:02:26.080]   I should probably say goodbye to all of my co-host Andy Naco.
[02:02:26.080 --> 02:02:30.320]   Thank you so much for joining us as always weekly.
[02:02:30.320 --> 02:02:31.760]   What's happening in your world this week?
[02:02:31.760 --> 02:02:33.680]   Anything exciting before we see you next week?
[02:02:33.680 --> 02:02:34.680]   Oh, God.
[02:02:34.680 --> 02:02:37.840]   A whole bunch of reviews that got backed up from the hurricane.
[02:02:37.840 --> 02:02:39.680]   So you're going to see the iPad review.
[02:02:39.680 --> 02:02:43.640]   You're going to iPad mini and the iPad for review, the last part of my Microsoft service
[02:02:43.640 --> 02:02:48.240]   review and maybe another piece about what's happening in the world of digital comics.
[02:02:48.240 --> 02:02:49.640]   Oh, very good.
[02:02:49.640 --> 02:02:51.960]   Alex Lindsay, what did I call you at the beginning of the show?
[02:02:51.960 --> 02:02:56.120]   The senior best person at Pixelcore ever, but boss man.
[02:02:56.120 --> 02:03:00.680]   I thought it was a little over the top, but I enjoyed it.
[02:03:00.680 --> 02:03:01.680]   Good.
[02:03:01.680 --> 02:03:02.680]   I'm glad.
[02:03:02.680 --> 02:03:04.320]   You're traveling in Houston now?
[02:03:04.320 --> 02:03:07.160]   Are you coming back to the day too soon?
[02:03:07.160 --> 02:03:13.000]   I'm actually back tomorrow for the day and then I'm in New York on Thursday and then I
[02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:16.440]   will be in Tel Aviv over the weekend.
[02:03:16.440 --> 02:03:19.880]   So I might try to do a tweet up if I have enough time.
[02:03:19.880 --> 02:03:22.960]   So if you're in Tel Aviv, let me know.
[02:03:22.960 --> 02:03:25.560]   But and then so hopefully it all goes well.
[02:03:25.560 --> 02:03:28.920]   Actually, I'm coming into Mac break next week from Tel Aviv.
[02:03:28.920 --> 02:03:29.920]   Wonderful.
[02:03:29.920 --> 02:03:35.440]   And then I'll be back in New York and then eventually I'll find my way back to San Francisco.
[02:03:35.440 --> 02:03:36.440]   All right.
[02:03:36.440 --> 02:03:38.600]   Well, Godspeed out there.
[02:03:38.600 --> 02:03:40.400]   Renee Richie, thanks so much for joining us.
[02:03:40.400 --> 02:03:44.320]   Renee from iMore, the editor over there who they're always breaking news.
[02:03:44.320 --> 02:03:47.520]   They've always got the best sources.
[02:03:47.520 --> 02:03:50.880]   What's the breaking news this week that we haven't read yet?
[02:03:50.880 --> 02:03:54.760]   For Apple, I mean, this got forest all stuff we've read, but now it's the time off with
[02:03:54.760 --> 02:03:58.800]   their planning for spring of next year was going to be the big thing before WWC.
[02:03:58.800 --> 02:03:59.800]   Cool.
[02:03:59.800 --> 02:04:00.800]   All right.
[02:04:00.800 --> 02:04:03.600]   So this is this is me.
[02:04:03.600 --> 02:04:04.600]   Okay.
[02:04:04.600 --> 02:04:09.760]   Another Mac break quickly is in the can now that you've had your break.
[02:04:09.760 --> 02:04:10.760]   Get back to work.
[02:04:10.760 --> 02:04:12.760]   You had gold bricks.
[02:04:12.760 --> 02:04:28.060]   [music]
