[00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:10.440]   What does he mean?

[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.040]   We will talk about what an eye watch could do, might do,
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.280]   and how much it should cost.

[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.680]   That's a good one.
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.240]   Sphere.

[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.960]   Speaking of spheres of influence,
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.960]   he influences all he was doing this week in Alex Show.
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.440]   Well, earlier, thank you for filling in for me while I--
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.200]   Well, dead dying.
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.400]   --got in here late.
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.080]   Renee Richie from iMore.com.
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.040]   Thank you for being here.
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.400]   How is it in more-- wait a minute.
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.600]   Your set has changed once again.
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.440]   I'm not in Montreal.
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.040]   I actually found a worst place to go.
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.560]   I'm in Winnipeg, Manitoba.
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.680]   Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.160]   You decide it wasn't cold enough where you were?
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.040]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.200]   Out of the freezer and into the ice.
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.360]   Winnipeg's the place where summer's three weeks long.
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.960]   Yeah, it's actually the coldest place in the world,
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.360]   sometimes during the year.
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.160]   Yeah, I had a friend played in a rock band
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.400]   who had a gig in Winnipeg.
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.080]   I actually asked him.
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.160]   I said, what's the worst place?
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.200]   He says Winnipeg.
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.080]   I won't say the name of the band, very well-known rock band.
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.720]   It was like without hesitation.
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.560]   Winnipeg.
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.240]   Winnipeg.
[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.960]   Summer or winter, Winnipeg.
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.040]   Annie Inako is here with his robotic dentistry.
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.720]   Once again, on display.
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.800]   Nice to see you.
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.240]   On that list of, once I become a psychotic trillionaire,
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.760]   I would love to go to a place like Winnipeg
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.320]   and simply say that either you love this place
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.040]   or you're really, really stuck here,
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:24.040]   I will contribute $15,000 per person up to $100,000 per family
[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.680]   if you want to move, I will underwrite your moving expenses
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.560]   and just see how many people stay in one of these places
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.200]   where, oh, risk minus 40 today.
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.760]   Well, there are a lot of places.
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.760]   It's a very odd place to choose to live, that's what I'm saying.
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.960]   I watched the Free the Whale movie last night.
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:43.760]   Really?
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.040]   No, the other one where the whales that are trapped in a lot.
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.200]   Oh, John Krasinski.
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.440]   Yeah, with John Krasinski.
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.600]   Yeah.
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.040]   I don't know why I was watching that.
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.240]   There was no child with me.
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.040]   I just--
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.320]   Renee, I wanted to feel good again today.
[00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.760]   That's it.
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.040]   I do too.
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.840]   Dem90 in the chat room says, you're now in the cold part of Canada.
[00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.280]   You had a cold or a part of Canada.
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.840]   They put that on a bumper sticker,
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.640]   but at that temperature, adhesive doesn't work.
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.680]   And then the cold part of Canada.
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.360]   But think of the great groups that have come from Winnipeg,
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.760]   Curtis B points out, including the Guess Who,
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.080]   Bachmann Turner Overdrive, and Neil Young.
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.920]   And I think out of Winnipeg is the key on that phrase.
[00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.160]   A guy who invented plain deicing lives in Winnipeg.
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.400]   Because of rise.
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.400]   I'm not even a part of him here at all.
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.720]   I've never been there, and I'd love to.
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.280]   Why are you in Winnipeg?
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.520]   I am visiting my good friend Kevin Mitchell-Luck
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:39.680]   from Cracberry.com.
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.160]   We're doing a bunch of work.
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.400]   And if you're going to work, you might as well be too cold
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:45.360]   to go outside and not work.
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.160]   Is that his apartment?
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:46.960]   It's a nice place.
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:47.280]   It looks good.
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:47.960]   Yeah, it's his house.
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.560]   You very kindly gave me his podcasting set up to use.
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:51.080]   Beautiful.
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.760]   Well, you sound good, you look good.
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.120]   And you have stairways.
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.040]   I like stairways on television sets that go somewhere or nowhere.
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.160]   Why don't we have any here?
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:04:59.760]   We should.
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.160]   I actually believe it or not.
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.000]   I was in the spec.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.880]   Believe it or not.
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.920]   The original spiral staircase from the screen savers--
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:09.440]   Oh, right.
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:10.560]   --is up the road a piece.
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.320]   A guy has it.
[00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.840]   I met a guy.
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:12.960]   He said, I have your staircase.
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.040]   I said, what?
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.280]   He said, yeah, when they took apart the set,
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.160]   they sold it off and stuff.
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.880]   And I have the spiral staircase.
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.760]   Said, I want it, but we never did manage to hook up and get it.
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:22.760]   Maybe we still will.
[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:23.160]   It'd be great.
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.160]   Then you'd be walking down the stairs
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.160]   at the open of the show.
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.160]   That's part of the show.
[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:27.660]   Right.
[00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.160]   Well, that's also a great design aesthetic.
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.120]   If you put in that plan that I want the set to look
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:36.480]   like the set of a 1983 action movie with unnecessary railings
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.080]   and balconies everywhere and a machine that does nothing
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.320]   but turn a huge gear and spit out fire every--
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.160]   Brilliant.
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:42.480]   --seconds.
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:43.720]   Brilliant.
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:44.320]   Like I said, calm.
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:45.320]   The staircase is nowhere.
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.360]   I think the reason the staircase works on television
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.720]   is that because it gives you the cue that this is a real space
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.880]   and there is more above and below.
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.480]   And that's a good cue to have, especially in a place
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.200]   which is basically a box with a thing.
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.400]   That's a nice thing to do.
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.440]   Anyway, we are not here to talk about silly things,
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.960]   like Winnipeg and staircases.
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.920]   We are here to talk about cabbages and kings.
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:09.400]   We are here to talk about Apple.
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.400]   And the reason I'm not really in a great big hurry--
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.040]   it's because it's pretty much the same stories
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.960]   we had last week.
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.880]   Tim Cook says, Apple's working on some really great stuff
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:21.240]   and some brand new products.
[00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.160]   Really great stuff.
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:28.680]   And there's lots of rules that those great things are--
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.720]   I think we've all coalesced into--
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.640]   those two great things are Apple TV and I watch.
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.280]   I don't think he even--
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.360]   this was very much like what he told all things
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.240]   D six months ago.
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:43.520]   He told this to the Wall Street Journal and part--
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.760]   it's a longer interview in which they talk about how
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.320]   Apple's buying back $14 billion in shares, which
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.760]   means Carl Icahn can stand down.
[00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:52.200]   Did you see--
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:57.640]   not many people push him to the curb.
[00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:58.240]   They did?
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.280]   Yeah, they've pushed him to the curb.
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:00.200]   He says, I give up?
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:00.720]   He gave up?
[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:05.040]   Well, that's because the ISS, the investment firm or whatever
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.120]   said that they aren't going to back him.
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.200]   And once they announced that, there
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.720]   was absolutely no chance he was going to get.
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.960]   In the 1980s, you spelled greed, Icahn.
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:15.960]   He was the guy--
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:20.920]   and he's the rebel investor, the guy who comes into a company.
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:21.680]   He has it.
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.520]   He may be one of Apple's biggest shareholders.
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:26.640]   I think he has more than 1% of Apple stock.
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:29.720]   Hundreds-- he says, I want, as a stockholder,
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.880]   he owns $4 billion in shares.
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:35.880]   I want Apple to give some of this cash, this $167 billion
[00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.840]   in cash it has in the bank, back to its shareholders.
[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:39.880]   Back to him.
[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:42.480]   Back to him, basically.
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:45.840]   This is really what's wrong with the stock market.
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.640]   Is Carl Icahn couldn't care less about anything,
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:51.360]   except I bought $4 billion with a hundred more dollars.
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.800]   I want it to be worth $8 billion now.
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:54.300]   Right.
[00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:54.800]   Please.
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.080]   I got that much on me right now.
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:59.880]   I don't bend down on the street to pick up a million dollar
[00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:02.200]   bill if I find it there in the gutter.
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:04.400]   Yeah, it's not about the long-term value of the company.
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.040]   It's about a quick pump and dump, which is sad,
[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.520]   because it affects so many companies so badly.
[00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:13.600]   But the interesting date to consider in this whole conversation
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:14.960]   is 2024.
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:15.680]   Why?
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:18.640]   At the rate Apple's buying back, they will be private.
[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:20.000]   Do you think they'll-- well, the plan
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.440]   is to buy back $60 billion worth of stock, not all the stock.
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:23.440]   I'm saying if they kept on doing it--
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:24.000]   If they kept doing it--
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   If they kept on doing it at the rate
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.240]   they're doing it at, which they could afford without--
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:28.920]   they would actually-- if they did it at the rate
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:33.480]   they're doing it now, their cash position
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:37.360]   would continue to increase if they bought 10% of their stock
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:38.120]   back a year.
[00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:40.920]   Who is ISS?
[00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:41.920]   Who is--
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:43.320]   Is that his investment company?
[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:44.600]   No, no, it's not his investment company.
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:45.160]   It's another one.
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:46.880]   Another one.
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.240]   He wrote, "Dear fellow Apple shareholders,
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:52.000]   while we are disappointed that last night ISS recommended
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.280]   against our proposal, our buyback proposal,
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:57.680]   we do not altogether disagree with their assessment.
[00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:03.480]   Basically, in their ISS said, on the spectrum of options
[00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:05.160]   for allocating capital, the board
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.640]   appears to have been sluggish only in returning access
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:10.800]   cash to shareholders.
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.760]   And even though the company has in place
[00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:15.440]   one of the largest buybacks in history--
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:17.560]   It's not one of is the largest buyback.
[00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:21.240]   We agree that this effort seems like bailing with a leaky bucket
[00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:23.640]   given the scale of the company's cash reserves.
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:30.400]   I think Apple's point of view and Tim Cook's point of view
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:33.360]   is we want the cash in case--
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:35.720]   Well, in case they decide they want to buy AT&T
[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:38.120]   or they want to buy Disney or they want to buy something
[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:40.560]   really, really big, you want to have that kind of cash
[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:41.000]   available.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.400]   It gives them a lot of freedom.
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:47.240]   Carl Icahn says, "I see money in that vault and I want some--"
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:48.920]   Anyway, he's back down.
[00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:50.960]   How old is he?
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:52.760]   How much longer do we have to put up with him?
[00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:55.000]   932, like you would.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.800]   He's an older man.
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:59.080]   Good look at fella.
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:00.720]   Nicely dressed.
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.200]   He doesn't appear to be wearing sunscreen,
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:03.960]   so that's maybe a good problem.
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:07.760]   I wonder what he plans to do with all that fast fortune.
[00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:09.160]   Probably not give it away.
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:10.560]   He's going back to the shareholders.
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:12.640]   Give it away, give it away, give it away now.
[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:14.640]   He's probably not going to go the way it bill gates.
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:15.720]   The Red Hot Chili Peppers.
[00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:16.560]   Yes.
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:18.880]   He does seem like one of those billionaires who
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:22.920]   likes it when people pay attention to the things that he says.
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:24.480]   77.
[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:25.480]   Yeah.
[00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:28.560]   When he makes all these statements,
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:30.600]   I wonder how much of this is really motivated
[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:34.000]   by this is his intense belief that this is something
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.720]   that Apple should do and how much of this
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:38.640]   is just that I get to be wise old investment
[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:39.840]   the guy who gets to--
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:40.920]   oh, well, a microphone.
[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:41.120]   Great.
[00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:43.520]   I will say something prophetic and interesting.
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.120]   Apple has not made a lot of big purchases.
[00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:48.800]   They've bought hither and little stuff.
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:51.160]   I think I think I read that they've never
[00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:53.000]   bought any company for more than a billion.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.560]   Yeah, they're fairly frugal.
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:56.280]   Tim Cook told Wall Street Journal, though,
[00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:58.000]   we have looked at big companies.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.200]   We have no problem spending 10 figures.
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:03.240]   How many is that?
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:04.360]   I have 10 figures.
[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:05.160]   That would be a billion.
[00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:06.000]   A billion?
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:06.720]   Yeah.
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:07.440]   Well, right.
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:09.600]   We have no problem spending 10 figures from range.
[00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:11.360]   But what about 11 figures?
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:12.600]   What about 11 figures?
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:15.560]   And I think that's on Instagram, I think, was this point.
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:15.880]   Right.
[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:18.480]   For the right fit that's in the best interest of Apple
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:21.560]   in the long term, no problem, none, zero.
[00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:23.280]   I think that the challenge for Apple
[00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:25.320]   would be the mix of cultures.
[00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:27.400]   I think buying a company that's that big,
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:29.520]   I think the biggest problem would be trying to assimilate
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:30.560]   that many employees.
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:33.000]   I think almost every time we see those kind of riders,
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:33.640]   it's pretty ugly.
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:34.080]   It's ugly.
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:34.880]   And Apple is--
[00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:35.200]   Especially--
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.720]   It's like a AOL time Warner.
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:38.200]   Well, especially when you have such a specific--
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:39.760]   HP Compaq.
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:42.680]   Well, and you have a very, very specific culture
[00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:47.760]   at Apple, which is very different than most other corporations.
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:49.960]   I think that that would be a difficult mix
[00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:52.120]   if you had too many people in a new company.
[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:53.560]   That's the same time.
[00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:54.880]   Although they buy a lot of companies,
[00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:56.800]   can you name the last time that they bought a company that
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.800]   really had its own public identity?
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:00.120]   They buy a lot of little companies
[00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:02.200]   that are starting up that seems to have a technology
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:04.040]   they want or--
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:05.880]   Yeah, even file makers have to name it.
[00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:06.880]   They're certainly on the rise, right?
[00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:08.560]   File maker, that was years ago, but that was probably
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:11.400]   the last big name acquisition.
[00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:13.240]   Max was probably their biggest integration,
[00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:14.080]   and that went the other way.
[00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:15.480]   Yeah.
[00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:16.840]   And even now, it's a struggle.
[00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:19.280]   I mean, they used to have this enough experienced people
[00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:21.280]   that you could do a mentor relationship with new people
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:23.040]   and really enculturate them quickly.
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:25.520]   And then they grew so fast, they had to start establishing
[00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:27.960]   an Apple University and teach more like a lecture hall
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:29.640]   because the people who were new to Apple
[00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:31.400]   started outnumbering by vast quantities
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:32.920]   that people established at Apple.
[00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:35.080]   And that's a huge problem right now,
[00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:36.400]   and any large scale purchase would only
[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:38.360]   exacerbate that problem.
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:39.840]   You're in the forest, Eddie, you.
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:41.000]   He's so funny.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.720]   He looked at Apple's 10Q, and he said,
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:48.520]   based on the app sales, iTunes sales, and all of that,
[00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:50.920]   he said, if you were to just split off iTunes
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:54.000]   into its own company, it would be 130 on the Fortune 5.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:56.800]   Figure than craft.
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:57.480]   Yeah.
[00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:57.800]   Yeah.
[00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:59.000]   You're in the gap?
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   It's doing OK.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.720]   Gross revenues, he figured out based on all this information
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:09.720]   of iTunes, is gross revenue $7 billion a quarter.
[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:14.320]   A quarter on the yearly basis, the iTunes Software Services
[00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:18.040]   Group had gross revenues of $23.5 billion
[00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:20.640]   with a growth of 34% year over year.
[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:21.480]   It's not bad.
[00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:22.200]   Take it.
[00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:23.080]   You like that kind of thing?
[00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:23.580]   Why?
[00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:24.080]   Eddy Cute.
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:25.680]   Money hand over fist.
[00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:29.400]   But really, and I don't think about running big companies,
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:31.240]   but it does raise the question.
[00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:36.680]   If you have a massive budget, I remember
[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:39.040]   when Microsoft first started taking off,
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.200]   they didn't know what to do with all the cash.
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:44.120]   They bought certificates of deposit.
[00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:45.120]   They bought CDs.
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:46.120]   Right.
[00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:47.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:48.320]   You're going to stuff it into something.
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:49.600]   It's like putting it in your mattress.
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:51.240]   It's like, what do you do with all that?
[00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:53.060]   Well, in the hard part, what makes it more complicated
[00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:56.520]   is most of it's offshore, so it's not as complicated as people.
[00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:59.280]   Well, there's a tax consequence if you repatriate it as well.
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:00.480]   Which Apple's avoided.
[00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:00.980]   Right.
[00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:03.440]   So I think 70% of that is offshore,
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:07.640]   so that means 70% of it is effectively untouchable, I think,
[00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:09.000]   unless you want to pay a fairly high--
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.760]   And you spend it on overseas.
[00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:13.080]   I mean, you can spend it on things overseas.
[00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:14.520]   But the-- yeah, that's--
[00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:17.800]   They could have bought AT&T.
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:19.320]   It's market caps $200 billion.
[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:20.520]   Well, they could have bought it.
[00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:21.080]   Yes, these folks--
[00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:21.280]   Most of them--
[00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:22.200]   --that though, or they don't want that.
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:23.040]   Yeah, you don't want that.
[00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:24.860]   I think what's more interesting though,
[00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:27.780]   is as you start to look at the Apple TV issues with that kind
[00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:32.300]   of money is Apple looking at going head to head
[00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:35.060]   with AT&T and Verizon and so on and so forth
[00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:38.460]   in specific markets, much as Google's done the fiber.
[00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:39.340]   I wish they would.
[00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:40.340]   But I mean, Apple got the money--
[00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:41.460]   But is it in their interest to go--
[00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:42.540]   I mean, look at Apple--
[00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:43.540]   OK, so here's--
[00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:45.500]   So I'm trying to put myself in Tim Cook's shoes.
[00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:46.220]   Here's the challenge.
[00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:47.620]   Apple's got a nice little business.
[00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:47.820]   Whoa.
[00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:49.860]   OK, it's got a nice little business.
[00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:54.080]   And he even says, we want to adjust for the long-term
[00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:56.440]   interest of shareholders, not for the short-term shareholder
[00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:57.480]   of the day trader.
[00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:58.800]   And what he's really saying is we
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:14:59.880]   want to plan for the long-term.
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:01.040]   So what is the long-term?
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:03.120]   You're not about bringing the stock price back up.
[00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:04.360]   It's not what you're about.
[00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:07.360]   You're about-- but you are about what's the next thing, right?
[00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:11.400]   Because you can't just coast off into the sunset.
[00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:13.440]   So--
[00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:15.600]   I don't think the information companies
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:17.760]   will get to do what the next big thing is
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:20.540]   until they start sidestepping the cable companies.
[00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:21.740]   So one last thing you want to do is
[00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:24.860]   to get into a business, an existing business, right?
[00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:27.100]   Well, I think that the--
[00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:29.300]   So you're saying, copy, copy, become a--
[00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:29.820]   You don't--
[00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:31.260]   Middleman for content?
[00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:32.660]   Well, no, no.
[00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:35.460]   A middleman for your own content.
[00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:37.460]   So the thing is is that I just don't
[00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:39.140]   think that you can do things that are aggressive
[00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:42.820]   and to prove models when you're trying
[00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:46.100]   to go through companies that have a traditional model that they
[00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:47.500]   want to maintain.
[00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:50.940]   So I think that Apple--
[00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:53.560]   In the same way that Google has done fiber
[00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:55.020]   in a handful of places to experiment,
[00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:57.560]   it puts in a normal-- if you look at what's happening in Austin,
[00:15:57.560 --> 00:15:59.760]   when Google went to Austin, it put an enormous amount
[00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:00.800]   of pressure on AT&T.
[00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:01.660]   It was now reacting.
[00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:02.500]   How about this?
[00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:03.100]   How about this?
[00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:05.940]   Sprint has now backed off the acquiring T-Mobile regulators.
[00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:07.940]   We're pretty clear that ain't going to happen.
[00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:09.780]   So yesterday, Sprint said, we're not going to buy T-Mobile.
[00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:11.980]   T-Mobile is only $18.3 billion.
[00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:14.220]   Yeah, but I don't think you want to buy any of the existing ones.
[00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:16.460]   I think you're buying baggage at that point.
[00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:19.980]   I think that looking at specific markets
[00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:23.140]   and building out your own network that supports those markets,
[00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:26.260]   that allows you to prove what's there, what happens is that also,
[00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:31.980]   when people start to see that, it creates consumer agitation.
[00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:33.620]   I mean, people get upset that they're not--
[00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:36.580]   they don't have that at where they are.
[00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:38.540]   Mark Gurman wrote a great article on 9-5
[00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:41.940]   about what you can tell what Apple's planning based
[00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:44.980]   on the hires Apple has made.
[00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:46.580]   We've talked about this a lot.
[00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:49.620]   This is going on.
[00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:50.860]   Yeah, it looks like a watch.
[00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:53.140]   So Cook said nothing.
[00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:57.180]   But every time he says that he's getting massive headlines, quote,
[00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:58.500]   "It's the Wall Street Journal a few days ago.
[00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:00.140]   There will be new categories.
[00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:01.660]   We're not ready to talk about it.
[00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:05.220]   But we're working on some really great stuff, which
[00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:07.020]   could be a paraphrase of what he said to all things
[00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:09.180]   D six months ago, right?
[00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:10.980]   He said anyone reasonable would consider
[00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:15.540]   what Apple's working on as a new category.
[00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:17.820]   He says he thinks Apple is still a growth company.
[00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:20.220]   That's kind of what investors are worried about.
[00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:21.580]   They don't want a growth company.
[00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:23.580]   But Apple's not really been showing the kind of--
[00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:25.220]   or at least its last quarterly report
[00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:30.340]   showed a slow and growth that might concern the market.
[00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:32.540]   Well, I think I think a revamped Apple TV
[00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:34.380]   in and I watch two very different markets.
[00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:36.340]   And I think that at this point, I think they're
[00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:37.580]   pretty close to the surface.
[00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:40.300]   We're seeing enough rumors that I don't think that at this point,
[00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:42.180]   I think it's more of a when than if.
[00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:43.820]   I don't know whether the Apple TV is going
[00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:45.100]   to be his actual screen or not.
[00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:47.660]   But I do think that they're going to revamp what they're--
[00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:50.580]   the hobby is going to turn into a business.
[00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:52.020]   Yeah, that's a definite.
[00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:55.540]   But I can't help but ask myself, when
[00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:57.300]   he talks about a new category, is he
[00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:59.140]   talking about a new category for Apple
[00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:02.460]   or a new category for the industry?
[00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:04.780]   I'm pretty sure it's just for Apple.
[00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:06.340]   But I wouldn't put a pass on to simply
[00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:09.100]   create something that they feel is so separate from anything
[00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:11.260]   else that's ever been made that they could call this.
[00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:13.380]   Well, this is a brand new product that really hasn't
[00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:14.620]   existed before in this form.
[00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:19.740]   I do think that one of the interesting--
[00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:24.700]   I mean, I think that a lot of the rumors with the Apple TV,
[00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:28.220]   I mean, if they open this up to games and lots of development
[00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:31.820]   and apps on your TV, I think that that is--
[00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:34.180]   it may not be an entirely new category,
[00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:36.900]   but it totally changes the offering
[00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:38.380]   that they're putting on the big screen.
[00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:39.380]   Wouldn't it be cool?
[00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:40.660]   Yeah, particularly when--
[00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:43.820]   I think that one of the least appreciated announcements
[00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:48.140]   from the last WWDC was iOS in the car.
[00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:51.500]   Because when you take this at the surface,
[00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:54.180]   you're talking about a way to make your phone integrate
[00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:56.060]   better with that little dinky little screen
[00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:57.420]   that's in your center console.
[00:18:57.420 --> 00:18:58.780]   But really, what they're talking about
[00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:01.780]   is the ability to project an operating system onto a much
[00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:06.100]   dumber device in which your iPhone is still
[00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:08.300]   critical to the process.
[00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:10.220]   Your iPad is still critical to the process,
[00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:12.460]   but you can actually put it in a place--
[00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:15.260]   interact with it in a place where it's not necessarily
[00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:16.500]   a handheld device.
[00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:18.820]   So I wonder if that really is one of the key things
[00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:21.220]   about the Apple TV, not just the idea
[00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:24.860]   of having a mirror display or even having an Apple TV display,
[00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:27.140]   but the idea of your phone essentially
[00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:30.380]   being a host for a much more rich interface,
[00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:32.860]   a much more rich experience by virtue of the fact
[00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:37.340]   that this Apple TV can simply take all of this iOS infrastructure
[00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:39.100]   and simply use that just as a way to project it
[00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:40.020]   onto a larger screen.
[00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:41.620]   When I have to admit that I've been really thinking
[00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:44.380]   about the whole TV tuner issue and being
[00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:46.420]   able to actually integrate with the cable companies
[00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:50.380]   and possibly even have a DVR or anything else that looks like that,
[00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:57.380]   I find myself irritated with the Comcast tuner that we have now
[00:19:57.380 --> 00:19:59.100]   and thinking that if Apple TV--
[00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:00.460]   that's the last little bit because I always
[00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:02.740]   go back and forth between the Apple TV
[00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:06.540]   and the standard cable tuner, being
[00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:11.340]   able to get that out of the mix, I think that it would be--
[00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:13.220]   I would never go back.
[00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:16.420]   If I could mix my cable viewing with my Apple TV,
[00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:17.380]   with everything else--
[00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:19.380]   I agree.
[00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:20.780]   As a user, I just don't want to use--
[00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:24.940]   Steve Jobs said the Isaac's in biography is terrible.
[00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:25.420]   It's crap.
[00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:26.580]   Oh my gosh, it's so horrible.
[00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:29.700]   Every time I use Comcast, I'm just like, this is amazingly bad.
[00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:30.660]   Tevo, which was better.
[00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:32.660]   We had replay, which was better.
[00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:33.820]   But they're not--
[00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:34.740]   That's not what we have.
[00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:37.460]   But this is the scale the problem an Apple faces,
[00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:39.820]   if they want to do something that ambitious with Apple TV.
[00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:41.380]   Remember that a lot of what they're
[00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:43.780]   able to do with the iPhone, version 1.0,
[00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:46.820]   was due to the fact they were able to negotiate terms with AT&T
[00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:49.060]   that were essentially, if you want this hot new phone,
[00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:51.220]   you've got to do exactly what we tell you to.
[00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:54.060]   And that includes ad infrastructure at your end
[00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:55.020]   to make stuff work.
[00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:57.180]   And the only reason why they were able to make that work
[00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:59.660]   was because AT&T was really on the ropes.
[00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:01.020]   And they were--
[00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:03.740]   I wouldn't go so far as to say that the iPhone was a lifeline
[00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:04.460]   for them.
[00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:07.500]   But if the iPhone had not worked out for them,
[00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:09.980]   they would probably have been bought out by somebody else
[00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:11.420]   long before now.
[00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:13.940]   But cable companies are doing extremely well.
[00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:18.500]   There are very few of them who have the nationwide coverage
[00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:19.980]   that an AT&T would have.
[00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:23.460]   And so if Apple wanted to do that sort of integration,
[00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:26.300]   where you would be able to put in something akin to a cable
[00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:29.620]   card inside of an Apple TV to make it into a cable tune,
[00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:33.940]   or they still have to talk to Verizon and talk to Comcast
[00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:36.220]   and talk to Cox and these few providers
[00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:38.620]   and say, we would very much like it
[00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:42.260]   so that people don't have to give pay $15 a month
[00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:44.820]   for your cable box and another $20 a month
[00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:46.420]   for this multi-room service.
[00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:49.220]   We would very much like our $99 dollar device
[00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:51.660]   to work so well with your system that you don't have
[00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:53.900]   to charge them for pretty much anything.
[00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:56.140]   And given that all these companies are still doing--
[00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:59.340]   are so well, they feel as though they can punch HBO
[00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:02.860]   and Netflix around, Apple's going to get laughed out
[00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:04.260]   of the room if they offer that sort of thing.
[00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:07.980]   Well, I mean, I think that's why I really don't think that--
[00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:12.260]   I'd be surprised if it would be anything akin to a cable box
[00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:15.220]   replacement or a tuner that works off of anything
[00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:16.100]   other than over the year broadcast.
[00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:17.340]   You don't want to deal with cable.
[00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:19.820]   Well, and here's an interesting thought from Evil IRC
[00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:21.020]   and our chatroom area, of course,
[00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:22.260]   facing a Supreme Court challenge.
[00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:25.620]   If they win, what if Apple buys Ariel?
[00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:27.980]   I think it's a complicated business.
[00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:30.020]   That's the company where you essentially
[00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:32.420]   rent a dime-sized antenna in a metro area
[00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:36.100]   and watch off-the-air TV on your Apple TV.
[00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:38.540]   Do we agree that that's the one thing missing that would make
[00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:41.620]   Apple TV a compelling product is live television?
[00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:43.420]   Apple certainly can't do it.
[00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:44.300]   Not really.
[00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:47.540]   I mean, for sports, it would be great.
[00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:50.700]   But how a bunch of live sports, like day-to-day sports,
[00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:51.220]   are even being--
[00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:52.620]   You know, it's funny, I'm watching the Olympic--
[00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:54.860]   You're probably going to demand it because as much as anything else.
[00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:56.300]   Well, even when you think you're watching it live,
[00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:57.420]   you're watching it recorded.
[00:22:57.420 --> 00:23:01.140]   I mean, I already knew one when I turned the Olympics on.
[00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:02.420]   I think that there are--
[00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:03.940]   We do a lot of live streaming.
[00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:05.460]   And there are three reasons to have live,
[00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:08.380]   and that's news-- breaking news, sports, and interactivity.
[00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:09.140]   Interactivity.
[00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:10.060]   And if you don't have one of the--
[00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:11.820]   You've got to have one of those three years not worth it.
[00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:16.700]   I'm going on record to say interactivity is key to all future media.
[00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:17.220]   Yeah.
[00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:17.900]   No, absolutely.
[00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:19.260]   That's what we do, and that's why we do it live.
[00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:20.780]   Hey, I want to show you the Chevy ad.
[00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:21.580]   I speak it in the Olympics.
[00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:24.060]   I was watching the Olympics, and I saw Siri.
[00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:24.540]   I saw Siri.
[00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:26.380]   In a Chevy ad, did you see this ad?
[00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:26.820]   I wish you had it.
[00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:29.500]   This is why you should not ask Siri to read your text messages.
[00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:31.340]   I hope that's not you getting kind of late.
[00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:34.140]   Oh, it was OK.
[00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:35.940]   Siri, do I have any new text messages?
[00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:38.980]   You have five messages from five people from Frank,
[00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:39.460]   bro.
[00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:40.740]   Last night was epic.
[00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:41.900]   They should have been proud.
[00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:43.140]   Next, from Tim.
[00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:44.540]   You ever find your pants?
[00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:45.740]   Mm-hm.
[00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:47.260]   Next, from John.
[00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:51.020]   I can't believe you got a tattoo on your--
[00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:53.220]   The Chevrolet Equinox with Siri Eyes Free
[00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:55.300]   offers enhanced integration through your iPhone.
[00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:57.700]   Is this a compelling ad?
[00:23:57.700 --> 00:23:59.340]   I can't wait to get that.
[00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:01.540]   It's a funny ad.
[00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:04.460]   I wish I know how much different that is from my old beat-up
[00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:06.660]   old beater that simply has a Bluetooth button that
[00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:07.500]   can activate Siri.
[00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:09.340]   My text is my text, sir, read to me.
[00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:10.420]   I don't think when you--
[00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:11.940]   I'm not sure, but correct me if I'm wrong.
[00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:13.700]   When you integrate Siri into the car,
[00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:15.780]   it's not like you have iOS in the car.
[00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:18.260]   You just simply have it pathway to the--
[00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:20.020]   And use your button for activating it.
[00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:21.380]   So you don't-- so it's not having to reach up
[00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:24.100]   to the home button to do that, because you have it safely
[00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:25.340]   and you've got to talk to you, have it right.
[00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:28.140]   And notice, by the way, the guy did what everybody does.
[00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:30.860]   He said, Siri, I always do that too.
[00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:31.500]   Why?
[00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:34.100]   It doesn't-- you don't need to address her when you use it.
[00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:35.940]   But it does feel more--
[00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:39.540]   Well, then it becomes like a stiller and mirror act.
[00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:40.380]   I was like, what?
[00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:43.340]   Well, how should I know who called you the last time?
[00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:44.420]   I'm talking to you.
[00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:45.500]   I'm talking to Siri.
[00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:46.180]   Siri!
[00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:48.180]   Siri, it's my phone.
[00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:49.220]   I'm talking to my phone.
[00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:50.180]   It's not your phone.
[00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:51.100]   Folks don't have that.
[00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:53.020]   You're going to tell me who Siri is right now.
[00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:54.260]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:55.780]   I mean, that's part of the genius of Siri,
[00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:57.620]   is that they gave it a very Pixar-like personality.
[00:24:57.620 --> 00:24:59.460]   And that took away a lot of the hesitation
[00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:02.620]   or discomfort from a normal person using the system.
[00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:05.780]   Although that's a form of skeuomorphism, I think, that we--
[00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:06.260]   Absolutely.
[00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:06.460]   It is.
[00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:07.500]   But I got to tell you--
[00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:09.820]   The thing that every time-- every time when a first Siri first
[00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:12.580]   came out, every time someone asked me how Siri was,
[00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:14.660]   I would ask her to open the pod bay doors.
[00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:15.940]   Open the pod bay doors, huh?
[00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:17.900]   Because the reaction was different every single time.
[00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:19.500]   And it was--
[00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:22.380]   So you know, by the way, Microsoft is also--
[00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:23.820]   Microsoft bought Tell Me, actually,
[00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:25.980]   has a fairly good voice control system.
[00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:30.060]   But they are going to add a Siri-like assistant
[00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:33.420]   to a Windows Phone 8.1 called Cortana.
[00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:35.140]   And that is a character from Halo.
[00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:36.820]   Beautiful, quite beautiful.
[00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:39.980]   And this picture doesn't do her justice.
[00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:41.620]   Voluptuous character from Halo.
[00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:43.580]   Only Microsoft can take a perfectly good idea
[00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:44.340]   and make it weird.
[00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:45.940]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:48.820]   They just, a couple of days ago, invested $15 million
[00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:49.660]   in four square.
[00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:53.020]   That'll be the location services.
[00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:55.300]   I think Microsoft's playing catch up all along here.
[00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:58.420]   In fact, we just saw an interesting story.
[00:25:58.420 --> 00:25:59.660]   We'll find out in a couple of days
[00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:01.860]   at Mobile World Congress that Nokia, which is now
[00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:05.540]   Microsoft Company, will be introducing its first Android phone.
[00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:07.180]   It's $14, Android.
[00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:08.660]   And it will be forked because it won't
[00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:11.820]   have the Google Play Store, which you really want.
[00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:16.260]   It will have its own Nokia App Store built into it.
[00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:21.340]   So I think it's pretty clear that Microsoft's not
[00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:22.620]   going to give up.
[00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:24.340]   But they're going to make as they always do.
[00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:28.500]   It's got a clugey little weirdo products.
[00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:30.300]   I don't understand--
[00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:30.940]   Yes, Siri--
[00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:32.580]   The real thread is Android.
[00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:35.020]   And in fact, much of the Siri functionality,
[00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:37.220]   many cases better than Android.
[00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:38.420]   Well, no, not really.
[00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:39.820]   They're just so different.
[00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:42.300]   I mean, I don't think you can compare Google
[00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:45.300]   now to Siri because Siri, it really is exactly what--
[00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:47.580]   I would be much more difficult to do that kind of in-car
[00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:50.460]   demo on an Android device because remember
[00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:52.860]   that Siri is really a micro app platform.
[00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:53.620]   Oh, you know.
[00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:54.900]   It's a free sort of thing.
[00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:57.900]   My Moto X knows-- first of all, knows I'm driving.
[00:26:57.900 --> 00:26:59.060]   The text message comes in.
[00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:01.900]   A very nice lady says, you've just received a text message
[00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:02.380]   from Lisa.
[00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:04.060]   Would you like me to read it to you?
[00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:05.140]   I say yes.
[00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:06.820]   I don't have to touch her.
[00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:08.020]   Look at anything.
[00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:09.580]   It reads me the message.
[00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:10.580]   I blush.
[00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:12.740]   It says, would you like to reply?
[00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:16.020]   And then I say yes and dictate the message.
[00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:18.260]   And then it reads me back the dictation.
[00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:19.180]   Which you blush again.
[00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:19.980]   Which I blush again.
[00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:22.460]   But that's very accurate, which is interesting.
[00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:22.980]   So far.
[00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:26.460]   And then sends it without any interaction except voice.
[00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:28.340]   That's a Motorola feature for one.
[00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:29.340]   I agree.
[00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:33.020]   And secondly, Siri, what I love the most about Siri
[00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:35.540]   is that it's been set up to be smart enough
[00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:37.780]   to understand that if it doesn't have enough information,
[00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:39.540]   it's not just going to bounce you back.
[00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:42.500]   You can say Siri, credit calendar appointment
[00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:44.940]   and it will say, OK, who is the appointment with?
[00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:45.500]   Where is it?
[00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:46.420]   What time is it?
[00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:48.460]   Whereas in terms of stock Android,
[00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:50.980]   you do have to make sure that it is in the format
[00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:53.460]   that this voice recognition software is expecting.
[00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:56.100]   And if you're missing something, unexpected things
[00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:57.500]   can happen.
[00:27:57.500 --> 00:27:57.900]   What about--
[00:27:57.900 --> 00:27:59.260]   So what about Google now?
[00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:01.460]   But they did create a personality
[00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:03.820]   that you expect to have a conversation with to get something
[00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:04.320]   done.
[00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:04.820]   Yeah.
[00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:05.740]   There are also different services.
[00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:08.180]   Like Siri is it as hard as sequential inference engine.
[00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:10.300]   All it does is ask a query that it remembers
[00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:12.220]   what the previous discussion was about.
[00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:15.180]   And bases the future responses on the ongoing discussion.
[00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:16.420]   And it does that very well.
[00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:18.620]   And it can link into a whole bunch of other services,
[00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:20.180]   most of which Apple doesn't exploit yet.
[00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:21.980]   But Siri is built into springboard now.
[00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:24.220]   It could theoretically have all sorts of services
[00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:25.260]   and apps hooked in.
[00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:27.100]   Where Google now pulls in tons of data
[00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:28.740]   and then learns a lot of intelligence
[00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:30.980]   about you, what your air flights are, where you're going.
[00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:32.700]   And it does that prognostication thing,
[00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:34.900]   which is really, really convenient if you're
[00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:36.940]   willing to give them the access.
[00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:38.700]   Yeah, I keep saying that the signature difference
[00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:41.020]   between these two services is that Siri
[00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:43.260]   is like the personal assistant in the next room who
[00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:45.300]   will do what you ask it to do.
[00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:50.420]   Google now is more like the valet
[00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:53.140]   in the terms of the upstairs downstairs.nabby,
[00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:55.300]   where you basically pick up your coat.
[00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:57.460]   And there's already your three tickets in the left hand
[00:28:57.460 --> 00:28:57.980]   pocket.
[00:28:57.980 --> 00:28:59.300]   And it's already been dusted down.
[00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:01.300]   And there's already a car waiting for you outside.
[00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:02.780]   It knows that this is the time that you're supposed
[00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:06.100]   to be going out to the theater with Lady whatever her name is.
[00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:08.260]   Lady Asquith, I like it.
[00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:09.700]   That's what I want.
[00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:13.460]   I think also Google now would be the one to recognize that, OK,
[00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:14.860]   I sense that your wife is in the car,
[00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:16.060]   so I'm not going to read that.
[00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:18.460]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:20.060]   I see the appointment you're going to,
[00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:22.740]   your wife is with you, will just skip this for the moment.
[00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:24.380]   Your photo copy will be--
[00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:25.980]   No, really, dictate it to me.
[00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:28.340]   No, I'm not going to.
[00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:31.300]   He also talked a little bit about Google
[00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:33.060]   selling Motorola to Lenovo.
[00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:35.860]   "I wasn't surprised," says Tim Cook.
[00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:38.740]   It was a logical transaction.
[00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:43.460]   He pointed out that Motorola was a financial disaster for Google.
[00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:47.940]   He also said that Google isn't committed to the phone
[00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:48.900]   business.
[00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:50.140]   Quote, "I think it's really hard to do
[00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:51.940]   hardware, software, and services
[00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:53.140]   and link all those things together.
[00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:54.140]   You know it's hard, Tim."
[00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:55.140]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:58.020]   If you're Apple, you know it's hard.
[00:29:58.020 --> 00:29:59.900]   That's what makes Apple so special.
[00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:01.100]   It's really hard.
[00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:03.940]   So I'm not surprised that they're not going to do that.
[00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:09.100]   I had a chance to speak to Ben Thompson earlier than we can.
[00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:10.300]   He had a really interesting take.
[00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:13.300]   And his theory was that Motorola has always been for sale,
[00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:15.460]   that Google needed to buy it because of the Motorola patent
[00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:16.180]   threat.
[00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:18.700]   But what was in it for Lenovo is when they manufacture phones
[00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:20.260]   in China, there's no IP protection.
[00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:22.180]   So it's very easy to have low-cost phones.
[00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:24.500]   But in North America, the cost of licensing IPs
[00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:27.420]   makes a phone $50, $100 more expensive.
[00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:30.100]   But now that they can cross-licensed Motorola patents,
[00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:32.820]   they can reduce the bill of goods and compete on the price.
[00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:35.740]   And Google was never interested in doing vertical integration
[00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:37.140]   for existing product lines.
[00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:38.980]   They want to do that for the future product lines,
[00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:41.580]   like robots and things like Nest2 Home Automation,
[00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:43.020]   the things that are really, really hard.
[00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:46.860]   They want to help drive forward by doing the entire widget,
[00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:48.100]   everything else, including phones,
[00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:49.740]   they're much happier to be the horizontal layer
[00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:51.460]   on top of everybody else's stuff.
[00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:53.540]   And that made a lot of sense to me, at least.
[00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:54.220]   Yeah.
[00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:55.620]   Who has been Thompson?
[00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:57.140]   He does strategicery.
[00:30:57.140 --> 00:30:58.380]   Oh, I love that site.
[00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:01.020]   What's interesting about him is he worked on Apple University
[00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:03.780]   at Apple, and then he went and worked on Windows 8 at Microsoft.
[00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:06.740]   So he has a very broad range of experiences to draw from.
[00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:11.180]   Yeah, that's a very good site we've quoted from often.
[00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:12.500]   Yeah, I mean, I think it's pretty obvious.
[00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:16.740]   Google wasn't a big loss selling Motorola.
[00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:18.940]   They got a lot of great stuff.
[00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:20.500]   And I think they got some concessions out
[00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:24.100]   of Samsung as a result of the sale that will, I hope,
[00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:26.260]   make Samsung less crappy.
[00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:27.580]   It was a good chess move.
[00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:28.580]   It was a chess move.
[00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:30.300]   It felt like that, anyway.
[00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:33.300]   Yeah, I mean, in terms of the big box of stuff
[00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:35.100]   that they got out of it, I mean.
[00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:37.060]   But at the same time, I think that there
[00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:40.700]   is more depth to this move than anybody's ever going to guess.
[00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:43.340]   I mean, the conversations that I was having with people
[00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:46.900]   I know inside Google who have been friends for years
[00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:49.980]   well before they even became employees at Google,
[00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:54.060]   talking to me about some of the work that was being done.
[00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:56.740]   Without violating any antitrust, of course.
[00:31:56.740 --> 00:32:00.540]   But the buzz that they were doing internally
[00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:04.460]   to make the Moto X as good as it possibly be,
[00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:06.900]   it left me with the impression that this wasn't simply
[00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:09.100]   a stock transaction or an IP transaction
[00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:11.460]   or simply as a way of bullying Samsung.
[00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:14.860]   It feels as though released a very large part
[00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:17.180]   of the Google-- inside the Google campus,
[00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:19.500]   this was an opportunity to create something that
[00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:21.700]   was a more Apple-like Android phone.
[00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:23.740]   And to a great extent, they actually
[00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:27.420]   succeeded with the Moto X.
[00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:30.020]   Asked about the possibility of a larger phone,
[00:32:30.020 --> 00:32:33.660]   Cook told the Wall Street Journal, quote, "What we've said--"
[00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:35.300]   I should do this in the doctor.
[00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:35.900]   You hold my hand.
[00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:39.500]   "What we've said is that until the technology is ready,
[00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:41.860]   we don't want to cross that line.
[00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:43.940]   That doesn't say we'll never do it.
[00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:47.820]   We want to give our customers what's right in all respects."
[00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:50.380]   Yeah, they don't like all that at all.
[00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:53.740]   I don't even know what he's talking about.
[00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:56.660]   There are many different parameters to measure a display.
[00:32:56.660 --> 00:32:59.220]   And we care about all those because we
[00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:03.540]   know that that's the window to the software.
[00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:05.580]   They looked at OLED and they looked at Pentile displays
[00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:06.900]   and they were kind of revolted by it.
[00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:08.100]   As they should have been, I agree.
[00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:09.940]   Yeah, they don't think it was worth doing big phones.
[00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:11.340]   It's the same thing as doing LTE.
[00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:12.420]   They're very slow in getting there
[00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:14.020]   because they wanted low-power radios.
[00:33:14.020 --> 00:33:17.740]   Can you not do an IPS LCD in a five-inch screen?
[00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:18.980]   If your Apple things are harder, it's
[00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:21.460]   the same reason Amazon tablets have higher technology
[00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:22.900]   levels than the Apple ones, because it's
[00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:24.620]   easy to make a small batch of that stuff.
[00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:28.020]   It's really hard to make 100 million of those things.
[00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:29.300]   And again, Apple's not using OLED.
[00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:30.180]   They're not going to use Pentile.
[00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:33.700]   They have to be able to make 100 million really high-quality
[00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:36.300]   LED IPS displays.
[00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:37.340]   That might be done there.
[00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:38.580]   Yeah, that might be--
[00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:42.780]   And the other consideration is that whenever they make this move,
[00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:46.740]   that will be the only source of this type of phone
[00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:48.580]   for the entire world.
[00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:54.660]   Whereas if an Android device maker or even a Windows tablet
[00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:56.300]   device maker decides to say, well, what
[00:33:56.300 --> 00:34:00.820]   if we had a new LCD technology that had yellow as a discrete color?
[00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:03.020]   If that turned out to be a terrible product
[00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:05.620]   or drive out the price or just drain the battery,
[00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:07.420]   you still have a million other devices that
[00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:09.220]   don't have that bizarre technology.
[00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:12.500]   Whereas if Apple screws up a large screen iPhone,
[00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:14.820]   every large screen iPhone on sale,
[00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:16.580]   the entire world is screwed up.
[00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:17.620]   That's not good.
[00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:19.700]   Galaxy S5, we're starting to see rumors
[00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:23.660]   that's going to be announced soon as well may have, in fact,
[00:34:23.660 --> 00:34:28.780]   a QHD screen, which would give it more than 500/4--
[00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:29.780]   is that what it is?
[00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:33.100]   Yeah, 500/4 inch screen would give it more than 500 DPI.
[00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:34.540]   Which is absurd.
[00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:36.300]   That's--
[00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:36.860]   I'll say it.
[00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:38.140]   I'll call it absurd.
[00:34:38.140 --> 00:34:39.460]   I think now, at this point--
[00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:42.140]   I think anything passed 300 is probably wasted, right?
[00:34:42.140 --> 00:34:42.820]   I mean--
[00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:45.540]   Yeah, I'd already think that's about 200.
[00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:49.340]   If you happen to have a hawk who likes to do multi-touch,
[00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:52.660]   the hawk will be chasing vermin on that screen
[00:34:52.660 --> 00:34:53.660]   to the cows.
[00:34:53.660 --> 00:34:56.780]   But that puts pressure on Apple because for one thing, Apple--
[00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:57.380]   you don't think so?
[00:34:57.380 --> 00:34:59.260]   Because I think people pay attention to numbers.
[00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:00.580]   Oh, stupid as that is.
[00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:01.220]   Apple knows that.
[00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:03.020]   That's why they said we have a 64-bit processor.
[00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:03.860]   There's a reason for it.
[00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:05.860]   I mean, Samsung's defense-- it's the same reason why they
[00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:08.100]   have a seven-inch tablet at 500 DPI.
[00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:10.740]   It's because they want one screen resolution target.
[00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:12.620]   And that has to scale down because otherwise,
[00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:14.420]   the large tablet will look silly.
[00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:17.820]   So if you have the 5-inch Galaxy S5 of that resolution,
[00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:20.860]   and then the note and the mega and whatever else--
[00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:23.300]   because they do-- is phoned at every quarter-inch screen size--
[00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:25.340]   the ones that start getting towards six and seven inches
[00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:26.340]   still look good.
[00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:27.980]   And developers have one resolution to target.
[00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:30.340]   Yeah, I had a G2 Flex.
[00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:31.620]   That's the curvy LG phone.
[00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:34.420]   It has 720p screen of six-inch phone.
[00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:37.100]   It really doesn't look good.
[00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:39.580]   You got to have some resolution there.
[00:35:39.580 --> 00:35:41.180]   Renee, is that really a problem?
[00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:44.940]   Because the Android world doesn't have a problem
[00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:48.220]   with all these completely disparate phone hardware
[00:35:48.220 --> 00:35:50.300]   from completely disparate makers that
[00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:52.380]   can choose their own resolutions on the fly.
[00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:52.860]   True.
[00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:54.260]   I don't know if it's a problem.
[00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:57.780]   I got a chance to interview Samsung.
[00:35:57.780 --> 00:36:00.620]   The product director for Samsung's mobile division.
[00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:02.020]   And that was his reasoning, is that they
[00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:04.140]   wanted to be able to present a consistent screen size
[00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:04.740]   to developers.
[00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:06.180]   Screen res, not size.
[00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:06.900]   Screen res.
[00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:07.540]   Screen res, sorry.
[00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:09.460]   Yes, consistent screen target for developers.
[00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:11.060]   And they're doing their own developer conferences.
[00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:13.500]   And they're trying to move Samsung in a certain direction.
[00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:16.660]   And that was the official corporate reason for why
[00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:17.620]   they were doing it at least.
[00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:21.820]   Anything else about the Tim Cook interview?
[00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:23.980]   We really parsed the hell out of that thing.
[00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:25.780]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:27.860]   I think we got all of that.
[00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:29.700]   Do you want to mention anything about Sapphire?
[00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:35.740]   They're firing up that Sapphire plant in Arizona.
[00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:37.140]   I do find it interesting that they're
[00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:38.660]   building it in Arizona rather than--
[00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:39.420]   Well, they bought it.
[00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:40.740]   So it's already been there.
[00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:43.460]   But I'm surprised that they're building it in the US
[00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:45.060]   rather than China.
[00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:46.940]   Well, that is interesting.
[00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:47.940]   This was a company--
[00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:48.940]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:49.620]   Sorry?
[00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:51.180]   The little glass was already in the US.
[00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:52.460]   And they acquired this company.
[00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:56.740]   This is not a new building for Apple.
[00:36:56.740 --> 00:37:00.660]   They and GT Advance are open to facility in Mesa.
[00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:05.220]   Earlier this year, according to Mark Gurman in 9 to 5 Mac,
[00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:06.740]   we learned that Apple is aggressively
[00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:10.340]   pushing to make the facility operational this month.
[00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:12.700]   And then it will produce a critical and new subcomponent
[00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:13.740]   for future Apple devices.
[00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:15.220]   We've speculated on this show that that
[00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:18.100]   might be the Sapphire on the fingerprint sensor
[00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:19.780]   or the Sapphire on the--
[00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:20.140]   Watch.
[00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:21.660]   --land's.
[00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:25.580]   But thanks to new documents and information,
[00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:28.020]   9 to 5 Mac is uncovered with the help of analyst Matt
[00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:28.660]   Margolis.
[00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:31.260]   We have a clearer picture of Apple's plans.
[00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:36.220]   Here we see some parts.
[00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:38.780]   And he says, "Appears Apple is planning
[00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:45.020]   to build Sapphire crystal displays for future iPhones.
[00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:48.300]   Not touch fingerprint readers, not lenses for cameras."
[00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:49.420]   That's a lot of Sapphire.
[00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:51.380]   That's a lot.
[00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:53.900]   That's a lot of Sapphire.
[00:37:53.900 --> 00:37:56.100]   Documents detailing inspection tool components
[00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:57.020]   explain their purpose.
[00:37:57.020 --> 00:37:57.380]   Purpose.
[00:37:57.380 --> 00:38:00.220]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:01.540]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:02.060]   I don't know.
[00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:05.660]   It doesn't really mean much to read this stuff.
[00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:06.980]   High quality Sapphire.
[00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:08.940]   Sapphire is stronger than glass.
[00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:11.940]   That gets used on high quality watches, expensive watches,
[00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:13.660]   because it doesn't scratch.
[00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:17.540]   And normally, in material science, the trade-off
[00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:19.820]   is plastic doesn't shatter.
[00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:21.340]   It's softer, but it scratches.
[00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:23.620]   If something is brittle enough not to scratch,
[00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:26.020]   it's also brittle enough to crack.
[00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:30.340]   And so finding a material that can both resist scratching
[00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:31.180]   and--
[00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:32.100]   Well, and I think that--
[00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:32.540]   I think that--
[00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:33.100]   Shatter.
[00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:34.660]   I think it'd be great to have it for iPhones.
[00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:37.580]   I still think it makes more sense for a watch
[00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:39.460]   than necessarily for an iPhone screen.
[00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:42.380]   But it'd be great to have it on an iPhone screen.
[00:38:42.380 --> 00:38:44.300]   Mark's point, I think, was they did the math on the amount
[00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:45.060]   they were producing.
[00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:46.580]   And it would take an awful lot of watches
[00:38:46.580 --> 00:38:49.500]   to use at the same time I'd glass.
[00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:51.660]   They're saying the first--
[00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:53.420]   they bought these testing units.
[00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:55.380]   The first 518 units according to Mark was
[00:38:55.380 --> 00:38:59.740]   could build between 103 million and 116 million 5-inch
[00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:02.540]   displays a year.
[00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:03.620]   5-inch displays.
[00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:04.180]   A lot of glass.
[00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:04.540]   A lot of glass.
[00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:09.660]   They're really ramping up to do a lot of something.
[00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:10.940]   And it could be just that's what they're
[00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:12.060]   going to use for all their displays.
[00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:13.140]   I mean, that could be another--
[00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:17.140]   And they've ordered over 100 tons of graphite.
[00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:18.140]   It's a lot of graphite.
[00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:18.980]   It's a lot of pencils.
[00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:21.460]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:23.780]   Boy, that would be a selling point.
[00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:29.380]   There's a few things that are kind of ignored in the specs
[00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:32.020]   Olympics because they don't really lend themselves
[00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:32.700]   to specs very well.
[00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:34.700]   But longer battery life-- I guess that lends itself
[00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:39.780]   to respect-- but better battery life and a better resilience.
[00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:43.180]   My daughter's gone through six iPhones.
[00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:45.340]   I mean, they just crack all the time.
[00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:47.260]   It's ain't dropped mine all the time.
[00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:48.220]   I'm going to curse it right now.
[00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:49.580]   But I drop mine all the time.
[00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:50.780]   I've never had a crack.
[00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:51.700]   She has a case.
[00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:53.660]   It won't crack if it hits anything but the front.
[00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:54.660]   But if it hits the front-- and this
[00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:55.980]   is true of all smartphones.
[00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:57.980]   If it hits the front, you've got a big glass panel.
[00:39:57.980 --> 00:40:02.300]   It's very difficult to protect that.
[00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:04.700]   I got to say that ever since Apple
[00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:09.020]   stopped making the dual side sandwich of the iPhone 4,
[00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:11.340]   that's when I stopped breaking phones.
[00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:12.540]   Yeah, that was a bad choice.
[00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:13.900]   For some reason-- exactly.
[00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:15.980]   I have no evidence to prove this,
[00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:18.100]   but I suspect that one of the reasons for the design
[00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:20.820]   change is that I don't think they could have--
[00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:23.340]   I don't think Apple could have been blind to the fact
[00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:26.460]   they were getting a lot of phones back with back panel cracks.
[00:40:26.460 --> 00:40:32.140]   And even when I was accidentally dropping an iPhone--
[00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:36.100]   later phones, it's like, OK, they're doing pretty OK by there.
[00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:40.060]   Although if it really--
[00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:41.300]   it would be difficult for the--
[00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:43.820]   how would Apple actually sell that point, though,
[00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:45.140]   if they say that we have a--
[00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:47.900]   our phones are not made with the Sapphire front screen.
[00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:52.540]   And they are less likely to crack than anything else.
[00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:55.340]   So are they implicitly encouraging people to say,
[00:40:55.340 --> 00:40:57.500]   please don't put your phones in those ugly cases
[00:40:57.500 --> 00:40:58.940]   that we absolutely hate?
[00:40:58.940 --> 00:41:03.020]   And can they say that without essentially saying there
[00:41:03.020 --> 00:41:06.900]   is now an expanded warranty on cracked screens?
[00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:10.860]   Well, I think they could do an ad in which they drop phones.
[00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:13.460]   Remember the old Samsonite ad where they had a gorilla
[00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:14.300]   handling the bags?
[00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:16.140]   They just have a-- give a gorilla the phone.
[00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:17.660]   He throws it and stuff, and it comes out fine.
[00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:19.020]   There's ways to demonstrate this.
[00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:20.220]   That's the problem.
[00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:23.100]   I bet that that commercial would be the most expensive thing
[00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:25.980]   Apple's made in 10 years, with all the lawyers who
[00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:27.100]   have to look at it.
[00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:29.380]   Don't say, will drop, things.
[00:41:29.380 --> 00:41:30.460]   Say if drops.
[00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:33.060]   Don't say shatter, proof, say shatter, resistance.
[00:41:33.060 --> 00:41:34.460]   Actually, don't say shatter resistant.
[00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:36.100]   If you could try not to say shatter.
[00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:40.100]   If you can say, it's the most durable phone we've made.
[00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:40.820]   Not ever.
[00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:43.140]   How about in the last three-- no, not three months.
[00:41:43.140 --> 00:41:44.300]   The last two and a half months.
[00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:45.700]   Since the Motorola rocker.
[00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:47.700]   Just say it's Sapphire.
[00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:48.260]   Sapphire.
[00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:49.860]   Say, ooh, exactly.
[00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:52.420]   I feel like-- and maybe it's just me because I
[00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:54.860]   have such bad experience because of my kids.
[00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:56.780]   Both of my kids have broken their phones many times.
[00:41:56.780 --> 00:41:57.500]   My kids have to.
[00:41:57.500 --> 00:41:58.300]   Yeah.
[00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:01.500]   But I think this is something that generally consumers would
[00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:02.780]   would--
[00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:03.300]   Oh, no.
[00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:04.140]   I think they get excited.
[00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:06.580]   That's definitely one of those things that I think that--
[00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:10.260]   More so than a 64-bit processor or a faster thing
[00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:11.780]   or even a higher DPI screen.
[00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:14.580]   Better battery life, and it doesn't break.
[00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:15.580]   That's a pretty compelling.
[00:42:15.580 --> 00:42:17.020]   I think that's what real people want.
[00:42:17.020 --> 00:42:19.580]   No, I think that the three things that you do is you have--
[00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:20.220]   it doesn't break.
[00:42:20.220 --> 00:42:22.060]   You have better battery life, and you have better--
[00:42:22.060 --> 00:42:23.740]   better low light performance on the camera.
[00:42:23.740 --> 00:42:24.340]   Ah, low light.
[00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:25.180]   That's good camera.
[00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:26.140]   That's the constant--
[00:42:26.140 --> 00:42:26.660]   Better camera.
[00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:27.540]   --is the constant issue.
[00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:30.500]   That's also a highlight that this is a feature that Apple can
[00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:33.420]   really make a lot of use of because Apple loves talking
[00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:34.260]   about materials.
[00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:36.940]   And if they say that this is not just another Rinky Dink
[00:42:36.940 --> 00:42:41.100]   blister-packed Android phone, this is a high-quality phone made
[00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:43.500]   out of the best materials that exist.
[00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:46.820]   And they're making enough they could put it in the watch, too.
[00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:47.740]   Absolutely.
[00:42:47.740 --> 00:42:48.260]   Why not?
[00:42:48.260 --> 00:42:49.180]   And I think if you look at--
[00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:50.660]   It's a slam dunk for a watch.
[00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:53.740]   Unfortunately, I'm wearing a test watch today.
[00:42:53.740 --> 00:42:54.660]   What is that?
[00:42:54.660 --> 00:42:55.980]   Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[00:42:55.980 --> 00:42:56.940]   Let's see that a little longer.
[00:42:56.940 --> 00:42:58.580]   Is that a-- that's the steel?
[00:42:58.580 --> 00:42:59.580]   That's a pebble steel.
[00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:00.260]   Pebble steel.
[00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:00.660]   Look at that.
[00:43:00.660 --> 00:43:02.020]   That's nice.
[00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:02.860]   It's my hand.
[00:43:02.860 --> 00:43:03.780]   My hand doesn't bend that way, too.
[00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:04.980]   It still looks clunky.
[00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:08.340]   I mean, I got to say, it doesn't make it a fashion statement.
[00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:11.020]   I mean, we're not talking about this watch today,
[00:43:11.020 --> 00:43:12.660]   but it's-- I'll have to say that it's
[00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:16.780]   at least within the bandwidth of what you would expect a watch--
[00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:18.220]   a man's watch to be.
[00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:20.180]   This is absolutely hopeless for--
[00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:21.180]   Oops.
[00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:22.740]   Sorry.
[00:43:22.740 --> 00:43:24.740]   Did you just start music on your phone?
[00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:26.900]   Yeah, because one of the coolest things
[00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:30.060]   about it is that it does have like a music controller.
[00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:33.060]   And so I-- and if I tried to show you how cool it
[00:43:33.060 --> 00:43:34.420]   scrolls things accidentally--
[00:43:34.420 --> 00:43:35.060]   Oh, that's neat.
[00:43:35.060 --> 00:43:35.580]   --got through there.
[00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:36.460]   Are you man enough?
[00:43:36.460 --> 00:43:37.780]   And when it gets to the end--
[00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:39.260]   yeah, so you can actually--
[00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:40.660]   That looks pretty good, correct?
[00:43:40.660 --> 00:43:41.500]   Yeah.
[00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:42.620]   There you go.
[00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:45.940]   And so as it keeps moving, it actually will update and show you.
[00:43:45.940 --> 00:43:47.140]   So I've seen a lot of pebbles.
[00:43:47.140 --> 00:43:48.980]   I have one, too, if Kickstarter guy.
[00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:52.300]   I've seen a lot of pebbles among Star Text journalist friends.
[00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:55.420]   I saw my first pebble in the wild sighting yesterday.
[00:43:55.420 --> 00:43:57.540]   I was picking up Lisa's son Michael.
[00:43:57.540 --> 00:43:59.300]   He had a play date.
[00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:01.100]   And the 16-year-old brother was watching them,
[00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:02.340]   and we were leaving.
[00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:06.020]   And the brother looked at his wrist,
[00:44:06.020 --> 00:44:07.740]   and then reached and got his phone out.
[00:44:07.740 --> 00:44:09.940]   And I said, you must-- is that a pebble?
[00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:11.380]   Because I was far enough away.
[00:44:11.380 --> 00:44:14.460]   But the fact that his phone rang after he looked at his wrist
[00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:17.780]   told me he's got a pebble on, and he did indeed.
[00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:19.900]   So that's an interesting-- this guy's kind of a geek,
[00:44:19.900 --> 00:44:22.060]   but I mean, he's a real person.
[00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:23.340]   So that's interesting to me.
[00:44:23.340 --> 00:44:26.220]   Well, this is my first time wearing a pebble
[00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:28.100]   as my daily driver.
[00:44:28.100 --> 00:44:31.100]   And I'm really digging it a lot, because you forget
[00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:33.100]   about how many times you reach into your pocket
[00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:35.740]   to touch your phone for absolutely nothing
[00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:36.980]   that Maris taking it out.
[00:44:36.980 --> 00:44:40.820]   And that includes-- that includes that, oh, the phone's ringing.
[00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:42.860]   I want to mute the-- I want to mute the-- whatever's playing.
[00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:43.900]   I just want to touch this button.
[00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:45.020]   I don't want to have to go up there.
[00:44:45.020 --> 00:44:47.540]   I don't want to have to even walk across the kitchen
[00:44:47.540 --> 00:44:50.260]   to where I left my phone to find out who's calling,
[00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:51.260]   all that kind of stuff.
[00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:53.140]   But we can talk about that later if you like.
[00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:54.580]   No, I'll-- I'll-- I'll-- I'll-- I'll-- I'll-- I'll-- I'll--
[00:44:54.580 --> 00:44:56.420]   wanted to say is that if you-- if you have my real phone,
[00:44:56.420 --> 00:45:02.460]   for some reason, the architects hate men of average height
[00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:05.820]   who wear watches, because doorknobs are exactly
[00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:07.620]   at the height of my wrist.
[00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:09.620]   And so every watch I own will usually
[00:45:09.620 --> 00:45:12.220]   have like a scratch here and here where I just simply
[00:45:12.220 --> 00:45:14.980]   grazed it against a doorknob at some point.
[00:45:14.980 --> 00:45:18.540]   So yeah, so that's-- that's why people are really, really hot
[00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:21.860]   about the idea of sapphire front faces on-- on watches,
[00:45:21.860 --> 00:45:24.380]   because we all know the famous story about--
[00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:27.180]   in the development of the original iPhone,
[00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:29.620]   very, very, very late in the game.
[00:45:29.620 --> 00:45:32.660]   Steve Jobs threw his sample iPhone at these engineers,
[00:45:32.660 --> 00:45:34.860]   showing them all the horrible scratches on the front
[00:45:34.860 --> 00:45:38.300]   and saying, we are not going to let our phone look that crappy
[00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:40.220]   after people having their pockets for three months.
[00:45:40.220 --> 00:45:42.540]   We're having a glass screen on this thing.
[00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:45.020]   And that-- I'm sure that that same--
[00:45:45.020 --> 00:45:47.100]   that same mentality is right here,
[00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:48.380]   because you don't spend all that time
[00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:50.780]   trying to develop a legitimately beautiful product,
[00:45:50.780 --> 00:45:54.140]   only to let users make it look crazy and horrible.
[00:45:54.140 --> 00:45:57.340]   So should I-- see, I've been waiting for the Apple.
[00:45:57.340 --> 00:45:59.660]   I want to just-- I mean, I figure if I buy a bevel now--
[00:45:59.660 --> 00:46:01.380]   Same as when I had my trio and I was--
[00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:02.820]   I knew that there was a phone coming.
[00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:04.260]   So for like a year, I just was--
[00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:05.260]   Yeah, I'm just dragging along.
[00:46:05.260 --> 00:46:05.760]   Yeah.
[00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:07.180]   I'm doing the same thing when I'm just dragging along
[00:46:07.180 --> 00:46:08.580]   waiting for the phone to be able to get it.
[00:46:08.580 --> 00:46:09.860]   The steel looks good, but I'm just thinking,
[00:46:09.860 --> 00:46:11.180]   I'm not going to buy-- if I buy the steel,
[00:46:11.180 --> 00:46:12.540]   I really were going to regret it in three months.
[00:46:12.540 --> 00:46:12.900]   I don't know.
[00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:15.380]   I mean, it's-- and there's so many open questions
[00:46:15.380 --> 00:46:17.700]   about how Apple would actually implement this.
[00:46:17.700 --> 00:46:19.020]   Would they actually-- do they actually
[00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:22.020]   feel like a watch like this makes sense that can actually
[00:46:22.020 --> 00:46:23.700]   control a phone directly?
[00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:26.300]   And also, would they make it open enough
[00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:27.780]   so that it would work with--
[00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:28.380]   Yeah, exactly where I am.
[00:46:28.380 --> 00:46:29.660]   --it won't be locked into an iPhone.
[00:46:29.660 --> 00:46:32.260]   But also that if Nest wants to do a controller,
[00:46:32.260 --> 00:46:37.140]   if given who they're owned by right now,
[00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:39.220]   if Nest wants to make a controller for the Apple Watch,
[00:46:39.220 --> 00:46:40.420]   would they let them do that?
[00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:42.260]   There's so far, I mean, they've got
[00:46:42.260 --> 00:46:44.460]   no problem with putting that stuff into the iOS store.
[00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:48.380]   But how open will this device be and how soon?
[00:46:48.380 --> 00:46:49.220]   What I think--
[00:46:49.220 --> 00:46:49.620]   But I think--
[00:46:49.620 --> 00:46:50.940]   --on the line, yeah, versus Gen 2.
[00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:51.820]   I think the other question, though,
[00:46:51.820 --> 00:46:53.940]   is how many Apple users really care?
[00:46:53.940 --> 00:46:55.700]   I mean, I think a lot of them, if it just fits
[00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:59.140]   into their ecosystem, I think that 50% to 60%, maybe even 70%
[00:46:59.140 --> 00:47:01.740]   of the Apple users will be like, awesome.
[00:47:01.740 --> 00:47:04.500]   But is that-- I realize that this
[00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:06.740]   is the sort of conversation you have
[00:47:06.740 --> 00:47:10.220]   when you're three hours into a pot filled weekend cabin
[00:47:10.220 --> 00:47:11.260]   with all your friends.
[00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:13.980]   But it's like, is that the proper role for Apple?
[00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:16.300]   If Apple really wants to aspire to greatness,
[00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:18.700]   do they want to create products that are only going
[00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:21.180]   to appeal to people who own other Apple products?
[00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:22.700]   Or do they want to legitimately realize
[00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:25.380]   that there are risks, there are pockets, there are desktops,
[00:47:25.380 --> 00:47:28.540]   there are notebook bags that we are not in right now,
[00:47:28.540 --> 00:47:32.100]   and we want to reach out to those people as well?
[00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:34.420]   It's more impressive for Pebble to simply say
[00:47:34.420 --> 00:47:38.180]   that we're creating a platform so that most people who own
[00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:40.700]   phones can benefit from this device.
[00:47:40.700 --> 00:47:43.180]   Nothing-- no BlackBerry, no Windows phone yet.
[00:47:43.180 --> 00:47:45.660]   Maybe they'll fix Windows phone, but a BlackBerry--
[00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:46.500]   I'm sorry, you're not--
[00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:48.500]   Well, but I think that I think if Apple only--
[00:47:48.500 --> 00:47:51.700]   if Apple only attracted people who already own iPads
[00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:56.780]   and iPhones and Macs, and a lot of them
[00:47:56.780 --> 00:47:58.940]   were really excited about it, that would be an incredible growth
[00:47:58.940 --> 00:48:00.220]   market for that.
[00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:02.980]   It would be the largest electronic watch ever made.
[00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:04.260]   They don't need to--
[00:48:04.260 --> 00:48:06.540]   I think that the issue is, at least in the first year or two,
[00:48:06.540 --> 00:48:08.020]   they wouldn't need to pay attention
[00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:11.700]   to anyone outside of their own user base.
[00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:14.460]   Just like the original iPod was Mac only at first.
[00:48:14.460 --> 00:48:17.540]   At some point, they had to prove it was a great product
[00:48:17.540 --> 00:48:20.820]   and also that they were capable of creating a great product.
[00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:23.100]   They had to do a Windows version of it.
[00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:24.460]   You've got a halo on.
[00:48:24.460 --> 00:48:27.220]   It's sort of like building, hey, we built a moon rover that
[00:48:27.220 --> 00:48:30.340]   works great in Earth gravity with lots and lots of oxygen
[00:48:30.340 --> 00:48:34.260]   around it saying that's great for someone who grew up on Earth
[00:48:34.260 --> 00:48:37.180]   and has access to Earth all the time and can control the Earth.
[00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:39.460]   Tell me-- come back to me when you can build something that
[00:48:39.460 --> 00:48:42.780]   can work outside of your own environment and ecosystem.
[00:48:42.780 --> 00:48:45.420]   But I think that that was also when Windows was so dominant.
[00:48:45.420 --> 00:48:47.860]   I think that the issue is a lot of people using these watches
[00:48:47.860 --> 00:48:49.020]   are going to be--
[00:48:49.020 --> 00:48:51.620]   they're going to be in iOS dominant and in iOS dominant world.
[00:48:51.620 --> 00:48:52.860]   I think that Apple may do it eventually.
[00:48:52.860 --> 00:48:54.700]   But I think that at least the watch
[00:48:54.700 --> 00:48:56.700]   and go two years without paying attention to anybody else
[00:48:56.700 --> 00:48:58.300]   and sell more than they can make.
[00:48:58.300 --> 00:49:00.180]   I'm not saying it wouldn't be successful.
[00:49:00.180 --> 00:49:02.940]   That's why I underscore the need to be in Colorado
[00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:04.740]   or Washington state and be very, very high
[00:49:04.740 --> 00:49:07.020]   to have this sort of philosophical discussion.
[00:49:07.020 --> 00:49:12.380]   But Apple is a company that's capable of and has achieved
[00:49:12.380 --> 00:49:14.540]   true greatness in its own time.
[00:49:14.540 --> 00:49:18.020]   And I just would hope that as they're
[00:49:18.020 --> 00:49:21.300]   creating new markets and new opportunities and new products,
[00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:23.420]   they don't feel as though everything they do
[00:49:23.420 --> 00:49:27.740]   has to be so tightly wrapped up in their own ecosystem
[00:49:27.740 --> 00:49:30.020]   that they're incapable of creating something for people
[00:49:30.020 --> 00:49:31.820]   who haven't bought into that ecosystem.
[00:49:31.820 --> 00:49:33.220]   That would be a shame, I think.
[00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:35.420]   We're going to take a break when we come back
[00:49:35.420 --> 00:49:38.940]   a new special channel for the Apple TV and lots more.
[00:49:38.940 --> 00:49:40.900]   Alex Lindsey is here from the Pixel Core.
[00:49:40.900 --> 00:49:44.780]   Renee Ritchie, iMore.com, Annie Inaco from the Chicago Sun.
[00:49:44.780 --> 00:49:47.500]   Times did you see the Super Bowl ad for Squarespace?
[00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:48.780]   I loved it.
[00:49:48.780 --> 00:49:51.460]   A better web awaits is the tagline.
[00:49:51.460 --> 00:49:55.460]   It was all the crap that you see on the web
[00:49:55.460 --> 00:49:59.060]   and then clear it away and make a beautiful, clean website
[00:49:59.060 --> 00:50:01.780]   with Squarespace.com.
[00:50:01.780 --> 00:50:05.260]   It's web hosting plus the best web content creation tools
[00:50:05.260 --> 00:50:08.620]   to give you the best of both worlds.
[00:50:08.620 --> 00:50:10.220]   In fact, I just saw Matt Cutts say
[00:50:10.220 --> 00:50:13.260]   that Google is now going to down-rank sites
[00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:16.580]   that have a lot of ads and clutter on the sites.
[00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:18.340]   You want to make a beautiful website.
[00:50:18.340 --> 00:50:19.660]   You want to go to Squarespace.
[00:50:19.660 --> 00:50:22.740]   The all-in-one platform makes it very fast, very easy
[00:50:22.740 --> 00:50:24.860]   to create your own professional website, your blog,
[00:50:24.860 --> 00:50:25.860]   your online portfolio.
[00:50:25.860 --> 00:50:29.500]   Look at this, they just added the logo creator tool.
[00:50:29.500 --> 00:50:30.980]   I'll show you the little movie.
[00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:34.660]   They're using Google Fonts and then they've
[00:50:34.660 --> 00:50:39.660]   got the Noun Project, 30,000 icons
[00:50:39.660 --> 00:50:43.700]   that you can use to design your own simple logo.
[00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:45.340]   I mean, this is what Squarespace is all about.
[00:50:45.340 --> 00:50:48.220]   It's making things easier for you to do,
[00:50:48.220 --> 00:50:52.700]   to make your site look unique without having to know CSS
[00:50:52.700 --> 00:50:55.100]   or JavaScript.
[00:50:55.100 --> 00:50:56.780]   Just really great stuff.
[00:50:56.780 --> 00:50:58.220]   Very easy to use.
[00:50:58.220 --> 00:50:59.660]   25 templates now.
[00:50:59.660 --> 00:51:01.460]   They've added more templates.
[00:51:01.460 --> 00:51:02.980]   You start with those basic templates
[00:51:02.980 --> 00:51:04.660]   and you just customize them to your heart.
[00:51:04.660 --> 00:51:05.820]   I can make this full screen chat.
[00:51:05.820 --> 00:51:07.300]   Would that be easier?
[00:51:07.300 --> 00:51:09.180]   Let's go full screen on this.
[00:51:09.180 --> 00:51:14.180]   This is a demonstration of the logo design tool here.
[00:51:14.180 --> 00:51:16.500]   So you get these icons on the left.
[00:51:16.500 --> 00:51:19.260]   Like I said, 30,000 starting point.
[00:51:19.260 --> 00:51:22.500]   You can then add text, obviously, in any of the Google Fonts.
[00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:25.220]   And there's, I don't know, 300 or 400 of those.
[00:51:25.220 --> 00:51:28.060]   It's just really, really easy to use and really gorgeous.
[00:51:28.060 --> 00:51:32.020]   But if you need some help, live chat and email support 24/7,
[00:51:32.020 --> 00:51:33.860]   plus a completely redesigned customer
[00:51:33.860 --> 00:51:36.580]   help site for easier access to self-help articles
[00:51:36.580 --> 00:51:39.100]   and video workshops.
[00:51:39.100 --> 00:51:43.540]   E-commerce is now available for all subscription plan levels,
[00:51:43.540 --> 00:51:46.020]   including the ability to accept donations,
[00:51:46.020 --> 00:51:50.380]   great for nonprofits, or maybe you're getting married in.
[00:51:50.380 --> 00:51:52.460]   You want to do a cash wedding registry.
[00:51:52.460 --> 00:51:53.700]   You don't need the little envelopes
[00:51:53.700 --> 00:51:55.820]   that you slip into the silk bags like in the godfather.
[00:51:55.820 --> 00:51:57.460]   You can just say, that's the modern way.
[00:51:57.460 --> 00:52:01.460]   Go to the Squarespace site, school fund drives, things like that.
[00:52:01.460 --> 00:52:02.820]   It starts at $8 a month.
[00:52:02.820 --> 00:52:06.460]   When you sign up for a year, you get a free domain name.
[00:52:06.460 --> 00:52:09.500]   And they've got the great apps to the Squarespace blog app,
[00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:13.140]   which lets you post, but also moderate comments.
[00:52:13.140 --> 00:52:16.340]   The new metric app lets you take a look at page views
[00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:20.020]   and other statistics, unique visitors, social media follows.
[00:52:20.020 --> 00:52:21.580]   If you look at the code, if you do know coding,
[00:52:21.580 --> 00:52:24.020]   look at the back end code, you'll see how gorgeous it is.
[00:52:24.020 --> 00:52:25.420]   We're about to rebuild our website.
[00:52:25.420 --> 00:52:26.260]   Really great stuff.
[00:52:26.260 --> 00:52:28.100]   We're going to do it on Squarespace.
[00:52:28.100 --> 00:52:28.740]   Of course.
[00:52:28.740 --> 00:52:29.700]   Our current one's on Squarespace.
[00:52:29.700 --> 00:52:31.300]   But we did it in the older--
[00:52:31.300 --> 00:52:32.820]   Oh, you got to go to Squarespace 6.
[00:52:32.820 --> 00:52:34.340]   So now, basically, what we're about to do
[00:52:34.340 --> 00:52:35.660]   is do a big upgrade.
[00:52:35.660 --> 00:52:36.820]   It's mobile responsive.
[00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:39.020]   That means the sites look great on any size screen.
[00:52:39.020 --> 00:52:40.020]   That's the way to do it.
[00:52:40.020 --> 00:52:41.740]   You start with a free two-week trial.
[00:52:41.740 --> 00:52:42.660]   You don't need a credit card.
[00:52:42.660 --> 00:52:43.660]   Just build.
[00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:45.780]   You can use the logo in everything.
[00:52:45.780 --> 00:52:47.460]   When you decide to sign up for Squarespace,
[00:52:47.460 --> 00:52:49.900]   just use our offer code Macbreak2.
[00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:50.980]   We're in February now.
[00:52:50.980 --> 00:52:52.020]   So Macbreak2.
[00:52:52.020 --> 00:52:55.740]   And you'll get 10% off and show your support for Macbreak Weekly.
[00:52:55.740 --> 00:52:57.500]   A better web awaits.
[00:52:57.500 --> 00:53:00.140]   And it starts with your new Squarespace website.
[00:53:00.140 --> 00:53:02.780]   I like their regard for aesthetics.
[00:53:02.780 --> 00:53:03.220]   Let's go ahead.
[00:53:03.220 --> 00:53:04.460]   We'll go to squarespace.com.
[00:53:04.460 --> 00:53:08.700]   And really, these guys have a great design sense.
[00:53:08.700 --> 00:53:13.020]   And in effect, you inherit it from them
[00:53:13.020 --> 00:53:15.220]   just by using Squarespace, which is great.
[00:53:15.220 --> 00:53:16.060]   Oh, this is their blog.
[00:53:16.060 --> 00:53:19.500]   Let's go to the site itself.
[00:53:19.500 --> 00:53:21.140]   squarespace.com.
[00:53:21.140 --> 00:53:24.060]   Use our offer code Macbreak2.
[00:53:24.060 --> 00:53:26.580]   I loved it.
[00:53:26.580 --> 00:53:29.980]   If you didn't see the edits on there, it's really a great ad.
[00:53:29.980 --> 00:53:31.100]   All right, continuing on.
[00:53:31.100 --> 00:53:31.780]   I didn't see this.
[00:53:31.780 --> 00:53:32.300]   Did you see it?
[00:53:32.300 --> 00:53:36.060]   There's a Beatles channel on your Apple TV.
[00:53:36.060 --> 00:53:36.860]   Beatles channel.
[00:53:36.860 --> 00:53:37.900]   Beatles channel.
[00:53:37.900 --> 00:53:39.980]   I guess for a limited time.
[00:53:39.980 --> 00:53:42.300]   I think it's a recognition of the Sullivan anniversary.
[00:53:42.300 --> 00:53:42.780]   Yeah.
[00:53:42.780 --> 00:53:45.420]   February 7th was the 50th.
[00:53:45.420 --> 00:53:46.420]   God.
[00:53:46.420 --> 00:53:48.260]   You know, as someone was--
[00:53:48.260 --> 00:53:50.820]   I was like, why is everyone talking about the Beatles?
[00:53:50.820 --> 00:53:53.980]   And they're like, it's the 50th anniversary idiot.
[00:53:53.980 --> 00:53:57.020]   You know, Steve Jobs described the Beatles
[00:53:57.020 --> 00:53:59.540]   as the model for Apple's business.
[00:53:59.540 --> 00:54:02.060]   He said, my model for business is the Beatles.
[00:54:02.060 --> 00:54:04.660]   They were four guys that kept each other's negative tendencies
[00:54:04.660 --> 00:54:05.980]   in check.
[00:54:05.980 --> 00:54:07.180]   They balanced each other.
[00:54:07.180 --> 00:54:08.900]   And the total was greater than the sum of parts.
[00:54:08.900 --> 00:54:11.300]   Great things in business are never done by one person.
[00:54:11.300 --> 00:54:13.540]   They're done by a team.
[00:54:13.540 --> 00:54:14.660]   I don't know about Ringo.
[00:54:14.660 --> 00:54:17.220]   You could leave Ringo out.
[00:54:17.220 --> 00:54:19.300]   No, I love Ringo.
[00:54:19.300 --> 00:54:19.860]   Not can I say it?
[00:54:19.860 --> 00:54:21.940]   I can't former Beato.
[00:54:21.940 --> 00:54:25.620]   I have to say that during the Grammys, I had this observation.
[00:54:25.620 --> 00:54:27.140]   I had it tweeted out that you have
[00:54:27.140 --> 00:54:31.820]   to remember that even on the worst day of Ringo's star's life,
[00:54:31.820 --> 00:54:36.140]   a star's adult life, he was still one of the Beatles.
[00:54:36.140 --> 00:54:40.300]   If he spills coffee all over himself today, slips and breaks
[00:54:40.300 --> 00:54:42.780]   his hip on the kitchen floor, and nobody
[00:54:42.780 --> 00:54:44.660]   recognized some of the ambulance comes in,
[00:54:44.660 --> 00:54:46.100]   he's still one of the Beatles.
[00:54:46.100 --> 00:54:48.260]   Still one of the Beatles always will be.
[00:54:48.260 --> 00:54:50.500]   So is Tim Cook Apple's yoko?
[00:54:50.500 --> 00:54:51.780]   No, Scott first all.
[00:54:51.780 --> 00:54:55.740]   I know.
[00:54:55.740 --> 00:54:57.220]   I don't know that we need to go there.
[00:54:57.220 --> 00:55:00.140]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:55:00.140 --> 00:55:02.820]   It's definitely one of those similes
[00:55:02.820 --> 00:55:05.460]   that you have to cut off at around 1966,
[00:55:05.460 --> 00:55:08.140]   because there was a point where all the four of these people
[00:55:08.140 --> 00:55:09.140]   hate each other.
[00:55:09.140 --> 00:55:10.980]   They couldn't even record with each other.
[00:55:10.980 --> 00:55:15.140]   Steve had a little bit of a rose colored glass,
[00:55:15.140 --> 00:55:17.380]   this view of the Beatles.
[00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:19.300]   Remember, Apple didn't get the Beatles on iTunes
[00:55:19.300 --> 00:55:22.060]   for a long, long time, it was a big deal when they do--
[00:55:22.060 --> 00:55:23.820]   That's why they stole their name.
[00:55:23.820 --> 00:55:24.900]   Yeah, Apple Core.
[00:55:24.900 --> 00:55:27.780]   Remember, they actually had a lawsuit with Apple Core,
[00:55:27.780 --> 00:55:31.140]   and they told Apple Core, wow.
[00:55:31.140 --> 00:55:32.700]   They told Apple Core that we will never
[00:55:32.700 --> 00:55:35.420]   get in the music business Apple computers did.
[00:55:35.420 --> 00:55:35.860]   Oops.
[00:55:35.860 --> 00:55:37.620]   And then they did.
[00:55:37.620 --> 00:55:39.740]   And it all started up again.
[00:55:39.740 --> 00:55:43.060]   Anyway, apparently there is footage
[00:55:43.060 --> 00:55:45.780]   from the Ed Sullivan show of the first appearance,
[00:55:45.780 --> 00:55:47.900]   available quote for a limited time.
[00:55:47.900 --> 00:55:50.580]   This isn't the new channel, you can listen to the US albums.
[00:55:50.580 --> 00:55:56.740]   So that's kind of cool.
[00:55:56.740 --> 00:56:01.180]   The new channel on Apple TV celebrating the 50 years
[00:56:01.180 --> 00:56:03.940]   anniversary of the Beatles.
[00:56:03.940 --> 00:56:05.580]   iTunes radio comes to Australia, too.
[00:56:05.580 --> 00:56:07.500]   Hello, Australia.
[00:56:07.500 --> 00:56:08.700]   And all the ships at sea.
[00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:10.500]   Yeah.
[00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:14.620]   Apple's iBooks Court Monitor, the ongoing case.
[00:56:14.620 --> 00:56:16.620]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:56:16.620 --> 00:56:18.660]   You remember that Apple did not like the Court
[00:56:18.660 --> 00:56:20.620]   appointed a monitor in the iBooks case.
[00:56:20.620 --> 00:56:22.460]   They said he doesn't know what he's talking about.
[00:56:22.460 --> 00:56:23.580]   He's never done this before.
[00:56:23.580 --> 00:56:26.700]   He's getting a lot of money, and he's really pissing us off.
[00:56:26.700 --> 00:56:29.260]   They've been-- Michael Bromwich, they've been--
[00:56:29.260 --> 00:56:31.540]   they went back to court saying no.
[00:56:31.540 --> 00:56:32.780]   There was a little stay there.
[00:56:32.780 --> 00:56:34.940]   But according to the Wall Street Journal,
[00:56:34.940 --> 00:56:38.140]   on Monday the second US Circuit Court of Appeals, Judge Cote--
[00:56:38.140 --> 00:56:47.780]   actually, the Court of Appeals reviewed Judge Cote's decision.
[00:56:47.780 --> 00:56:50.460]   And what they did is they said, Bromwich stays in place,
[00:56:50.460 --> 00:56:54.020]   but his duties are a little narrower.
[00:56:54.020 --> 00:56:55.940]   He's authorized to request interviews and documents
[00:56:55.940 --> 00:56:58.260]   of the company only to ensure that Apple has policies
[00:56:58.260 --> 00:57:01.660]   in place to prevent future antitrust violations
[00:57:01.660 --> 00:57:04.940]   and that senior executives and board members understand them.
[00:57:04.940 --> 00:57:09.900]   So they don't know if that really cut him back that much.
[00:57:09.900 --> 00:57:11.380]   Well, is his request to get Johnny
[00:57:11.380 --> 00:57:13.220]   I've on the stand probably won't go anywhere now?
[00:57:13.220 --> 00:57:14.700]   I don't know.
[00:57:14.700 --> 00:57:16.300]   Future antitrust violations?
[00:57:16.300 --> 00:57:17.860]   Johnny.
[00:57:17.860 --> 00:57:18.380]   I don't know.
[00:57:18.380 --> 00:57:18.860]   I mean, I--
[00:57:18.860 --> 00:57:21.220]   But I do think that that's what they really wanted to do
[00:57:21.220 --> 00:57:23.940]   is not have him talking to people who don't really
[00:57:23.940 --> 00:57:26.740]   have any impact on the iBook situation.
[00:57:26.740 --> 00:57:29.700]   I think they felt like he was a little bit of a loose cannon
[00:57:29.700 --> 00:57:30.820]   that they had to pay him too much.
[00:57:30.820 --> 00:57:31.940]   He didn't have the expertise.
[00:57:31.940 --> 00:57:32.940]   He's on a fish and fish.
[00:57:32.940 --> 00:57:35.660]   And now he's convening members of the board of directors
[00:57:35.660 --> 00:57:36.580]   and executives.
[00:57:36.580 --> 00:57:38.100]   And who is this guy?
[00:57:38.100 --> 00:57:40.020]   And I can understand why that would feel that way.
[00:57:40.020 --> 00:57:41.820]   And I think they probably realized
[00:57:41.820 --> 00:57:43.340]   they're going to have to put up with it.
[00:57:43.340 --> 00:57:45.620]   But I think they realized he was kind of just doing this
[00:57:45.620 --> 00:57:46.620]   judging.
[00:57:46.620 --> 00:57:47.620]   You know, I need--
[00:57:47.620 --> 00:57:48.260]   I don't know.
[00:57:48.260 --> 00:57:49.260]   Oh, yeah, he was.
[00:57:49.260 --> 00:57:50.260]   OK.
[00:57:50.260 --> 00:57:51.220]   For $1,000, this is just--
[00:57:51.220 --> 00:57:53.740]   That's what lawyers-- that's how it is.
[00:57:53.740 --> 00:57:54.740]   Just another job.
[00:57:54.740 --> 00:57:56.340]   He didn't work so hard for this cushy assignment
[00:57:56.340 --> 00:57:57.340]   to waste it now.
[00:57:57.340 --> 00:57:58.340]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:57:58.340 --> 00:58:00.540]   Right, exactly.
[00:58:00.540 --> 00:58:04.140]   All right, so we kind of talked about the watch.
[00:58:04.140 --> 00:58:07.340]   We mentioned Mark Gurman's great article.
[00:58:07.340 --> 00:58:10.540]   I think that you can make some decisions or some thinking
[00:58:10.540 --> 00:58:12.540]   about what Apple might be doing with the watch
[00:58:12.540 --> 00:58:14.540]   based on who they have hired.
[00:58:14.540 --> 00:58:18.940]   Because it really isn't merely fitness stuff.
[00:58:18.940 --> 00:58:22.340]   There's a lot of health stuff in here.
[00:58:22.340 --> 00:58:25.020]   They've been meeting with the FDA.
[00:58:25.020 --> 00:58:26.060]   You've got Bud Triple.
[00:58:26.060 --> 00:58:28.460]   You've got Bob Mansfield, two of their superstars
[00:58:28.460 --> 00:58:31.020]   on the team.
[00:58:31.020 --> 00:58:34.660]   Kevin Lynch, who they brought in from Adobe.
[00:58:34.660 --> 00:58:36.700]   And then in the fitness realm, of course, J Blonik.
[00:58:36.700 --> 00:58:38.700]   We've mentioned him before from--
[00:58:38.700 --> 00:58:40.580]   he's a guy who did the field band at Nike.
[00:58:40.580 --> 00:58:43.980]   Tim Cook on the board at Nike, so that makes sense.
[00:58:43.980 --> 00:58:48.700]   But they've also brought in health folks, a guy who
[00:58:48.700 --> 00:58:56.020]   was a scientist at Phillips Research named Roy Rayman,
[00:58:56.020 --> 00:58:58.300]   who I like his name.
[00:58:58.300 --> 00:58:59.500]   I think the bigger picture.
[00:58:59.500 --> 00:59:01.300]   He's a sleep expert.
[00:59:01.300 --> 00:59:03.900]   Well, I think the big picture here, of course,
[00:59:03.900 --> 00:59:05.740]   is that-- does it Apple's hired 100 people
[00:59:05.740 --> 00:59:06.900]   to think about watches?
[00:59:06.900 --> 00:59:08.300]   And so obviously, what they're trying to do
[00:59:08.300 --> 00:59:10.940]   is think about how to make what, at least when they come out
[00:59:10.940 --> 00:59:14.100]   the door, the best watch they could possibly make.
[00:59:14.100 --> 00:59:17.500]   That does as many things as it can well.
[00:59:17.500 --> 00:59:19.820]   I mean, they're definitely not taking this lightly.
[00:59:19.820 --> 00:59:21.140]   This isn't going to be an experiment.
[00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:23.220]   Yeah, they're throwing a lot of things against the wall.
[00:59:23.220 --> 00:59:26.020]   But it does sound like based on what the health book is
[00:59:26.020 --> 00:59:28.700]   keeping track of in iOS 8.
[00:59:28.700 --> 00:59:31.940]   German says, according to sources familiar with iOS 8's,
[00:59:31.940 --> 00:59:34.180]   health book, Apple is preparing its device
[00:59:34.180 --> 00:59:36.780]   to be able to interpret hydration.
[00:59:36.780 --> 00:59:39.300]   That's the first device I've heard of that.
[00:59:39.300 --> 00:59:42.380]   The one thing to remember is blood pressure, glucose, pulse,
[00:59:42.380 --> 00:59:43.300]   and heart rate.
[00:59:43.300 --> 00:59:44.860]   The one thing to remember about this stuff
[00:59:44.860 --> 00:59:47.940]   is that Apple doesn't just work on one device.
[00:59:47.940 --> 00:59:49.180]   Some people are saying, how can they
[00:59:49.180 --> 00:59:50.100]   do all this this year?
[00:59:50.100 --> 00:59:51.340]   The technology is not ready yet.
[00:59:51.340 --> 00:59:52.100]   It's just impossible.
[00:59:52.100 --> 00:59:52.980]   It's too late.
[00:59:52.980 --> 00:59:53.860]   Does this mean it's delayed?
[00:59:53.860 --> 00:59:56.260]   All it means is that Apple, like with every other product,
[00:59:56.260 --> 00:59:58.740]   is working on this version, next year's version,
[00:59:58.740 --> 00:59:59.940]   and then four years out.
[00:59:59.940 --> 01:00:01.500]   And whether we see--
[01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:03.140]   if a sensor technology is not ready yet,
[01:00:03.140 --> 01:00:05.340]   we'll just see it at a later point in time.
[01:00:05.340 --> 01:00:06.980]   Everything they're working on now is
[01:00:06.980 --> 01:00:09.460]   part of the product cycle of this device, not necessarily
[01:00:09.460 --> 01:00:11.380]   the specific iteration we'll see now.
[01:00:11.380 --> 01:00:12.580]   But absolutely.
[01:00:12.580 --> 01:00:14.780]   Version one will have a limited feature set
[01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:16.740]   but every feature will work perfectly.
[01:00:16.740 --> 01:00:18.020]   Or at least that will be the ideal.
[01:00:18.020 --> 01:00:20.620]   But they hired a guy with white hair and a lab coat.
[01:00:20.620 --> 01:00:23.780]   That means to me--
[01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:27.780]   this guy is an expert on measuring pulse.
[01:00:27.780 --> 01:00:29.180]   But I think a lot of this stuff is also
[01:00:29.180 --> 01:00:32.500]   you're going to be thinking about what you want three
[01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:34.660]   versions down when you make the first one,
[01:00:34.660 --> 01:00:37.300]   because you've got to think about a lot of those bits and pieces.
[01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:42.620]   I definitely agree with Renee and Andy that I don't--
[01:00:42.620 --> 01:00:44.900]   you're not going to read the tea leaves and say, oh, look.
[01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:45.980]   No, we'll get something simpler.
[01:00:45.980 --> 01:00:48.540]   I mean, we got-- the first iPhone didn't have any apps.
[01:00:48.540 --> 01:00:49.700]   First iPad, yeah?
[01:00:49.700 --> 01:00:50.060]   Yeah.
[01:00:50.060 --> 01:00:51.060]   Bigger.
[01:00:51.060 --> 01:00:52.140]   I'll put it this way.
[01:00:52.140 --> 01:00:55.820]   If any company can successfully sell a product that
[01:00:55.820 --> 01:01:00.220]   requires you to insert a catheter, I think it's going to be out.
[01:01:00.220 --> 01:01:00.820]   Wow.
[01:01:00.820 --> 01:01:01.620]   Ouch.
[01:01:01.620 --> 01:01:02.060]   Ouch.
[01:01:02.060 --> 01:01:03.940]   Oh, do you want to-- Leo, do you want the data,
[01:01:03.940 --> 01:01:04.980]   or do you not want the data?
[01:01:04.980 --> 01:01:05.660]   Yes or no?
[01:01:05.660 --> 01:01:06.140]   It's that's--
[01:01:06.140 --> 01:01:08.620]   How badly do you want the data?
[01:01:08.620 --> 01:01:09.860]   All right.
[01:01:09.860 --> 01:01:12.660]   Just bringing it up, just mentioning it.
[01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:14.180]   No, but I think it's like what we discussed
[01:01:14.180 --> 01:01:15.780]   this previously, like, past book and everything else.
[01:01:15.780 --> 01:01:17.380]   We'll see the first iteration of the technology
[01:01:17.380 --> 01:01:19.620]   that will become a lot more promising as more stuff falls
[01:01:19.620 --> 01:01:20.180]   into place.
[01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:20.680]   Yeah.
[01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:26.980]   How much do you think they're going to have to charge for this?
[01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:28.820]   I've been turning that one over my mind.
[01:01:28.820 --> 01:01:33.980]   How much could they charge for an Apple Watch, regardless
[01:01:33.980 --> 01:01:37.940]   of what it does, to make it into an attractive accessory
[01:01:37.940 --> 01:01:39.980]   to all the other Apple stuff that you have?
[01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:42.500]   Well, I think we can answer the question,
[01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:43.980]   how much could they charge?
[01:01:43.980 --> 01:01:46.540]   I don't know if we could say how much they will charge.
[01:01:46.540 --> 01:01:49.140]   Is it aimed at the Panerai Rolex card?
[01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:51.060]   Well, it's not $50,000.
[01:01:51.060 --> 01:01:54.980]   But I would say they can charge somewhere up to $500 for it.
[01:01:54.980 --> 01:01:55.460]   What was that?
[01:01:55.460 --> 01:01:55.820]   Can't exactly.
[01:01:55.820 --> 01:01:58.020]   Galaxy Gear, was that 300, 400?
[01:01:58.020 --> 01:01:58.540]   It's 400.
[01:01:58.540 --> 01:02:00.060]   Yeah.
[01:02:00.060 --> 01:02:01.220]   Look how well that did.
[01:02:01.220 --> 01:02:02.060]   Yeah.
[01:02:02.060 --> 01:02:03.820]   Actually, you know, Evan Dunn in our chat room said,
[01:02:03.820 --> 01:02:07.860]   I have a Martian, I have a pebble, and I have a Galaxy Gear,
[01:02:07.860 --> 01:02:10.300]   and I'm the one I wear all the time, Galaxy Gear.
[01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:11.420]   How much is that?
[01:02:11.420 --> 01:02:12.580]   I think it's 400.
[01:02:12.580 --> 01:02:13.060]   How much was it?
[01:02:13.060 --> 01:02:14.380]   300, 400, I think you're right.
[01:02:14.380 --> 01:02:16.180]   We have to wait for the Wall Street Journal leak,
[01:02:16.180 --> 01:02:17.740]   and then it will be exactly half of that.
[01:02:17.740 --> 01:02:21.220]   I don't know for sure.
[01:02:21.220 --> 01:02:23.620]   Can they go over 500?
[01:02:23.620 --> 01:02:25.740]   I don't think they would.
[01:02:25.740 --> 01:02:26.220]   But they could.
[01:02:26.220 --> 01:02:29.860]   Could be there $300 for the Galaxy Gear.
[01:02:29.860 --> 01:02:31.140]   Yeah.
[01:02:31.140 --> 01:02:33.140]   250 dollars for the pebble steel.
[01:02:33.140 --> 01:02:33.660]   Yeah.
[01:02:33.660 --> 01:02:35.540]   I think it'd be $399, $499.
[01:02:35.540 --> 01:02:37.580]   I think that's the range.
[01:02:37.580 --> 01:02:39.860]   Maybe, you know, now that I'm seeing that there's other watches
[01:02:39.860 --> 01:02:42.500]   or that much, I'm thinking they could go to seven.
[01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:43.740]   Oh, God, no.
[01:02:43.740 --> 01:02:44.620]   That's stupid.
[01:02:44.620 --> 01:02:45.460]   That's crazy, Pam.
[01:02:45.460 --> 01:02:46.500]   That's crazy, Tom.
[01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:47.740]   I think it depends on what it is.
[01:02:47.740 --> 01:02:49.820]   I myself am thinking.
[01:02:49.820 --> 01:02:53.620]   I myself am thinking they got a crisis under the iPhone.
[01:02:53.620 --> 01:02:58.780]   If they, for every $25 they charge above the cost of an on contract
[01:02:58.780 --> 01:03:01.980]   iPhone right now, that increases the degree of difficulty,
[01:03:01.980 --> 01:03:04.020]   I think, by a couple of percentage points.
[01:03:04.020 --> 01:03:08.380]   I don't, again, I don't put a past Apple to create a product
[01:03:08.380 --> 01:03:11.180]   that is so compelling to command a premium price.
[01:03:11.180 --> 01:03:13.140]   But I'm thinking that they should be--
[01:03:13.140 --> 01:03:15.420]   they're going to be aware of how much these competing things
[01:03:15.420 --> 01:03:18.620]   work, how much these competing things cost.
[01:03:18.620 --> 01:03:22.300]   And they have to start thinking about how much can we
[01:03:22.300 --> 01:03:26.540]   charge for a device that pretty much nobody has right now.
[01:03:26.540 --> 01:03:28.900]   I remember that when the iPad first came out,
[01:03:28.900 --> 01:03:31.020]   everybody was throwing out, it was going to be $1,000.
[01:03:31.020 --> 01:03:33.220]   Oh, it can't be a dime less than $700.
[01:03:33.220 --> 01:03:35.540]   I think I said 700, 750.
[01:03:35.540 --> 01:03:38.260]   I think that one of the reasons why Apple got the price under 500
[01:03:38.260 --> 01:03:41.740]   is that they understood that this was a brand new thing.
[01:03:41.740 --> 01:03:45.220]   That they were not going to be able to tell somebody, well,
[01:03:45.220 --> 01:03:48.780]   this is the reason why we charge $1,000 for our notebook
[01:03:48.780 --> 01:03:51.500]   is that it's $300 better than the $700 notebook.
[01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:53.060]   This is a watch that they're going to have
[01:03:53.060 --> 01:03:56.020]   to convince people that they actually want and need.
[01:03:56.020 --> 01:03:59.140]   So that's why I think that I don't know what the target really is.
[01:03:59.140 --> 01:04:02.580]   But again, I'd be really surprised if it's much above the cost
[01:04:02.580 --> 01:04:03.580]   of a new iPhone.
[01:04:03.580 --> 01:04:05.820]   And I do think there's a psychological barrier of $500.
[01:04:05.820 --> 01:04:08.460]   And I think a $499 watch would--
[01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:08.980]   That's crazy.
[01:04:08.980 --> 01:04:10.140]   --do much better than a $500.
[01:04:10.140 --> 01:04:13.540]   700 is crazy pants, $500.
[01:04:13.540 --> 01:04:15.900]   OK, tell me what it does.
[01:04:15.900 --> 01:04:17.100]   And you've got to absolutely--
[01:04:17.100 --> 01:04:18.580]   All right, well, let's think.
[01:04:18.580 --> 01:04:19.820]   You've got to pull me away for $500.
[01:04:19.820 --> 01:04:21.740]   If it does, what the Pebble Watch does,
[01:04:21.740 --> 01:04:23.580]   it can't be more than $200, right?
[01:04:23.580 --> 01:04:24.860]   It's got to be Pebble Watch price.
[01:04:24.860 --> 01:04:26.620]   But add to the Pebble-- so the Pebble Watch
[01:04:26.620 --> 01:04:28.100]   does notifications.
[01:04:28.100 --> 01:04:28.540]   It does.
[01:04:28.540 --> 01:04:29.980]   You could play, stop music.
[01:04:29.980 --> 01:04:32.020]   You can play-- actually, there's a little flappy bird game
[01:04:32.020 --> 01:04:33.660]   that you can play on it.
[01:04:33.660 --> 01:04:35.180]   You wouldn't really want to play games on it.
[01:04:35.180 --> 01:04:35.900]   It's like a snake.
[01:04:35.900 --> 01:04:37.100]   With the jobs to the iPhone, he said,
[01:04:37.100 --> 01:04:38.380]   this is one of which an iPod cost.
[01:04:38.380 --> 01:04:39.780]   This is how much a phone costs.
[01:04:39.780 --> 01:04:41.140]   And then he said, we're--
[01:04:41.140 --> 01:04:42.860]   altogether, these things would cost you this.
[01:04:42.860 --> 01:04:44.260]   And then three months later, he said,
[01:04:44.260 --> 01:04:44.780]   guess what?
[01:04:44.780 --> 01:04:46.580]   We're dropping the price by several hundred.
[01:04:46.580 --> 01:04:48.020]   And they did that with the Apple TV,
[01:04:48.020 --> 01:04:49.780]   and they did that with the iPad when it went to the mini.
[01:04:49.780 --> 01:04:51.500]   So they've got a history of putting things--
[01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:53.380]   what the market will bear and then making it cheaper.
[01:04:53.380 --> 01:04:54.740]   So let's-- OK, so it does a Pebble.
[01:04:54.740 --> 01:04:56.340]   It does a Fitbit thing.
[01:04:56.340 --> 01:04:59.740]   Maybe it adds some unusual stuff like hydration,
[01:04:59.740 --> 01:05:03.860]   measuring your hydration, heart rate, and perhaps even
[01:05:03.860 --> 01:05:05.380]   blood oxygen, that kind of thing.
[01:05:05.380 --> 01:05:06.100]   So let's say--
[01:05:06.100 --> 01:05:06.940]   I don't know if these are--
[01:05:06.940 --> 01:05:08.500]   And no, but one more thing.
[01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:10.340]   Let's say it's gorgeous.
[01:05:10.340 --> 01:05:11.660]   Let's say it really does--
[01:05:11.660 --> 01:05:14.900]   I mean, the Pebble Watch and all the others are clunky as hell.
[01:05:14.900 --> 01:05:17.700]   A guy might be able to put up with it, as you say, Andy.
[01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:20.860]   What if it's really slim, it's beautiful?
[01:05:20.860 --> 01:05:21.980]   You're not embarrassed to wear it.
[01:05:21.980 --> 01:05:23.580]   In fact, it is a piece of jewelry.
[01:05:23.580 --> 01:05:26.980]   Remember there, they've hired a lot of fashion people.
[01:05:26.980 --> 01:05:29.180]   But now you're talking about getting into even another problem
[01:05:29.180 --> 01:05:31.860]   where you've got people like--
[01:05:31.860 --> 01:05:35.420]   you got-- they're best hope us to try to sell to people like me,
[01:05:35.420 --> 01:05:36.620]   who still wear watches.
[01:05:36.620 --> 01:05:41.420]   And it was just five years ago that I bought my first watch
[01:05:41.420 --> 01:05:45.420]   that was not made out of plastic or had a Star Wars logo of some kind on it.
[01:05:45.420 --> 01:05:48.540]   And even there, I thought that $200 is a reasonable amount of money
[01:05:48.540 --> 01:05:49.420]   to pay for a watch.
[01:05:49.420 --> 01:05:51.700]   Because underneath me, there are people
[01:05:51.700 --> 01:05:53.740]   who stopped wearing watches a long time ago.
[01:05:53.740 --> 01:05:56.740]   Above me, there are people who are saying, I bought--
[01:05:56.740 --> 01:06:00.180]   how much do this-- I just paid $2,000 for a watch
[01:06:00.180 --> 01:06:05.500]   because you don't understand every piece was pulled right from the buttocks
[01:06:05.500 --> 01:06:10.540]   of the most rare, jeweled insect that science can find inside the Amazon.
[01:06:10.540 --> 01:06:13.780]   These watch aficionados, for which they are not going to give up
[01:06:13.780 --> 01:06:16.780]   their favorite watches for an electronic gadget.
[01:06:16.780 --> 01:06:19.780]   And remember that the other wearable that we're not putting into this conversation,
[01:06:19.780 --> 01:06:24.940]   we're talking about, OK, here's the $400 Samsung, here's the $250 pebble.
[01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:28.100]   Well, how about the $99 Fitbit that--
[01:06:28.100 --> 01:06:32.220]   this is-- I think it's so strong, it was because it is so affordable,
[01:06:32.220 --> 01:06:33.100]   you can take a chance on it.
[01:06:33.100 --> 01:06:36.620]   What if Apple doesn't try to compete with those and says, no,
[01:06:36.620 --> 01:06:39.900]   we're going to go after a product for the very well off?
[01:06:39.900 --> 01:06:40.820]   $2,000.
[01:06:40.820 --> 01:06:41.940]   I guess-- there you go.
[01:06:41.940 --> 01:06:43.300]   Why is that $2,000?
[01:06:43.300 --> 01:06:44.540]   It's the Porsche design block.
[01:06:44.540 --> 01:06:45.860]   You have that?
[01:06:45.860 --> 01:06:46.540]   Kevin has that.
[01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:47.780]   You dog you.
[01:06:47.780 --> 01:06:49.180]   Look at that.
[01:06:49.180 --> 01:06:50.420]   How many of those do they sell?
[01:06:50.420 --> 01:06:52.140]   I don't know, but they have a Porsche design store,
[01:06:52.140 --> 01:06:54.660]   and they have one in gold if you want to start going up to the tens of thousands.
[01:06:54.660 --> 01:06:58.180]   I'm going to guess they sold about three, one to Alicia Keys.
[01:06:58.180 --> 01:06:58.740]   But it doesn't--
[01:06:58.740 --> 01:06:59.820]   They gave her that one.
[01:06:59.820 --> 01:07:01.860]   That's part of the design market.
[01:07:01.860 --> 01:07:04.540]   But I do think that they could go after--
[01:07:04.540 --> 01:07:06.180]   OK, this is--
[01:07:06.180 --> 01:07:10.060]   Apple used to be really not a company of the people.
[01:07:10.060 --> 01:07:12.260]   I always was the computer for the rest of us,
[01:07:12.260 --> 01:07:14.980]   but it really was a computer for people who had a lot of money.
[01:07:14.980 --> 01:07:18.300]   Well, it's a company that's for people who have a lot of money.
[01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:21.740]   So what if they just embraced that and say, hey, we're Porsche, we're BMW.
[01:07:21.740 --> 01:07:23.900]   But that's why I think you look at a $4.99 range.
[01:07:23.900 --> 01:07:25.100]   And they wouldn't get away with that.
[01:07:25.100 --> 01:07:25.980]   They wouldn't-- why not?
[01:07:25.980 --> 01:07:28.180]   Who's going to stop them?
[01:07:28.180 --> 01:07:30.540]   People who have money to spend on things.
[01:07:30.540 --> 01:07:34.580]   I think even-- I think Apple understands that here is how much money we can--
[01:07:34.580 --> 01:07:38.940]   we can sell the reason why our budget MacBook is $1,000.
[01:07:38.940 --> 01:07:44.060]   But if they tried to make a $2,000, well, it's the exact same thing as our $1,000 version,
[01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:49.460]   but it is framed in pure glimmering green.
[01:07:49.460 --> 01:07:50.340]   And it is an exclusive--
[01:07:50.340 --> 01:07:51.700]   You know what's for the upper class?
[01:07:51.700 --> 01:07:54.260]   You know what's a deal breaker more for me is what we talked about earlier,
[01:07:54.260 --> 01:07:55.820]   which is the openness of it.
[01:07:55.820 --> 01:07:57.980]   All the other competitors, except for maybe the Samsung,
[01:07:57.980 --> 01:08:00.180]   but the other guys are open.
[01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:02.140]   And I have to be--
[01:08:02.140 --> 01:08:02.940]   Well, they do.
[01:08:02.940 --> 01:08:07.140]   And I don't think Apple-- it's not in Apple's blood to be an open product.
[01:08:07.140 --> 01:08:10.100]   I just-- I don't want it to be an open product.
[01:08:10.100 --> 01:08:16.900]   See, I think that as I keep talking about this, I'm more inclined to think that this--
[01:08:16.900 --> 01:08:20.500]   I'm right-handed, so I wear my watch on my left wrist.
[01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:24.340]   I'm inclined to think this is a-- Apple will make a right-risk product,
[01:08:24.340 --> 01:08:27.940]   so that this will-- you will still wear whatever your favorite watch is on this wrist,
[01:08:27.940 --> 01:08:29.900]   but there will be another device like a--
[01:08:29.900 --> 01:08:30.900]   Oh, no.
[01:08:30.900 --> 01:08:35.940]   Like a bit that puts in-- that is more like a band than an actual wrist device
[01:08:35.940 --> 01:08:40.420]   that allows you to deliver new services and new sensors
[01:08:40.420 --> 01:08:42.820]   that can then be appreciated through a device in your pocket.
[01:08:42.820 --> 01:08:44.180]   Yeah, the only thing I think--
[01:08:44.180 --> 01:08:47.460]   So I had a Nike fuel band for quite some time until I broke it.
[01:08:47.460 --> 01:08:51.300]   And I guess I feel like--
[01:08:51.300 --> 01:08:57.380]   once my Nike fuel band stopped working, I didn't have the need to go get another one,
[01:08:57.380 --> 01:08:59.540]   because I didn't like having a two-risk experience.
[01:08:59.540 --> 01:09:02.340]   So I think that was the issue, is I didn't like having both of them.
[01:09:02.340 --> 01:09:06.900]   And I did find, though, that I almost wanted to just use my Nike fuel band instead of my watch,
[01:09:06.900 --> 01:09:08.740]   as a watch.
[01:09:08.740 --> 01:09:13.540]   And that led me to definitely feel like if Apple did what the Nike fuel band did
[01:09:13.540 --> 01:09:18.580]   and did a lot of other little bits and pieces,
[01:09:18.580 --> 01:09:20.100]   I'd much rather have that than the watch that I have,
[01:09:20.100 --> 01:09:23.860]   which is in a reasonable price range to switch over.
[01:09:23.860 --> 01:09:27.860]   And so-- but I think that the--
[01:09:27.860 --> 01:09:30.500]   I guess the whole thing about-- the reason I think Apple won't
[01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:34.100]   extend is that they just wanted to work,
[01:09:34.100 --> 01:09:35.460]   especially when they first come out of the gate.
[01:09:35.460 --> 01:09:40.980]   I think maybe they look at expanding to other markets or other platforms once it's working,
[01:09:40.980 --> 01:09:45.060]   but I think the way to guarantee that it's really going to work smoothly
[01:09:45.060 --> 01:09:48.180]   is to not try to integrate with Android and a bunch of other platforms,
[01:09:48.180 --> 01:09:52.100]   because I know that we just started getting back into software development,
[01:09:52.100 --> 01:09:55.540]   and my programmer was asking me what platforms I want to develop on,
[01:09:55.540 --> 01:09:56.660]   and I was like, yeah, just a Mac.
[01:09:56.660 --> 01:09:58.980]   And when we do the iOS stuff, we're just going to do iOS,
[01:09:58.980 --> 01:09:59.860]   because I don't want to think about it.
[01:09:59.860 --> 01:10:03.300]   I don't want to think about how I'm going to work with a whole bunch of permutations.
[01:10:03.300 --> 01:10:04.100]   It's just too much trouble.
[01:10:04.100 --> 01:10:06.020]   And I don't need to.
[01:10:07.780 --> 01:10:11.620]   You know, those kind of side level of dependencies and apples, Apple really likes being able to move
[01:10:11.620 --> 01:10:14.020]   quickly, and I'll have to worry about what other people do with their stuff.
[01:10:14.020 --> 01:10:14.260]   Yeah.
[01:10:14.260 --> 01:10:16.420]   All right.
[01:10:16.420 --> 01:10:19.780]   Our show today brought to you by LegalZoom.com.
[01:10:19.780 --> 01:10:22.340]   Not all offer them, but they do let you save on your legal needs.
[01:10:22.340 --> 01:10:28.420]   And if you need to, you can access the network of legal plan attorneys in almost every state,
[01:10:28.420 --> 01:10:31.060]   pre-negotiated flat rates, very affordable.
[01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:34.340]   LegalZoom.com, are you-- I don't know, starting a new business.
[01:10:34.980 --> 01:10:40.020]   Maybe this is the year that you protect your family with a will or a durable power of attorney,
[01:10:40.020 --> 01:10:42.500]   health care directives, that kind of thing.
[01:10:42.500 --> 01:10:44.900]   Well, that's a New Year's resolution.
[01:10:44.900 --> 01:10:47.140]   I'm not going to snack.
[01:10:47.140 --> 01:10:50.420]   I'm going to exercise.
[01:10:50.420 --> 01:10:54.420]   I'm going to incorporate a form in LLC, and I'm going to make a million dollars.
[01:10:54.420 --> 01:10:58.260]   Of course, the problem is when you're starting this business, you don't have a million dollars
[01:10:58.260 --> 01:10:58.660]   to waste.
[01:10:58.660 --> 01:11:04.740]   So $99 to get you an LLC or a chapter S or C corporation, plus the state filing fees.
[01:11:04.900 --> 01:11:06.260]   That's what we did when I started to it.
[01:11:06.260 --> 01:11:10.500]   And we're still using those papers, by the way, the LLC papers from way back when.
[01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:15.300]   A million entrepreneurs now have started their businesses with LegalZoom.com.
[01:11:15.300 --> 01:11:16.660]   Trademark protection as well.
[01:11:16.660 --> 01:11:19.380]   You got to trademark your brand.
[01:11:19.380 --> 01:11:20.180]   It's so important.
[01:11:20.180 --> 01:11:23.700]   One of the nice things-- it should give you a little piece of mind.
[01:11:23.700 --> 01:11:27.620]   90% of LegalZoom customers recommend LegalZoom to their friends and family.
[01:11:27.620 --> 01:11:28.020]   90%.
[01:11:28.020 --> 01:11:31.540]   You could create a will for $69.
[01:11:31.540 --> 01:11:32.420]   A living trust.
[01:11:33.300 --> 01:11:35.780]   There are no surprise fees, no hassles, no headaches.
[01:11:35.780 --> 01:11:40.500]   It's very straightforward, very easy.
[01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:44.660]   LegalZoom step-by-step process was created by a team of experts in law and technology.
[01:11:44.660 --> 01:11:46.260]   So they've done it nicely.
[01:11:46.260 --> 01:11:48.100]   Look at all the different things you could do at LegalZoom.
[01:11:48.100 --> 01:11:50.660]   If I go to LegalZoom.com right now, browse around.
[01:11:50.660 --> 01:11:52.260]   I know there's some stuff you need to do.
[01:11:52.260 --> 01:11:52.980]   You've been putting off.
[01:11:52.980 --> 01:11:53.940]   You could do it right now.
[01:11:53.940 --> 01:11:58.900]   LegalZoom is not a law firm, but it can connect you with three-party attorneys.
[01:11:58.900 --> 01:12:03.060]   That's helpful sometimes, like with the LLC, I was trying to decide what state to incorporate
[01:12:03.060 --> 01:12:03.780]   in.
[01:12:03.780 --> 01:12:09.380]   And there's benefits to Delaware, which is where we did form the LLC,
[01:12:09.380 --> 01:12:10.740]   and there's benefits to California.
[01:12:10.740 --> 01:12:12.180]   And it would have been nice.
[01:12:12.180 --> 01:12:12.740]   They didn't have it.
[01:12:12.740 --> 01:12:13.220]   What did you do?
[01:12:13.220 --> 01:12:14.260]   I'm Delaware.
[01:12:14.260 --> 01:12:19.620]   But I would have been nice if I could have actually asked a third-party attorney.
[01:12:19.620 --> 01:12:20.180]   You can now.
[01:12:20.180 --> 01:12:21.380]   That legal plan is great.
[01:12:21.380 --> 01:12:22.820]   And it's very affordable.
[01:12:22.820 --> 01:12:23.940]   You know what makes a good neighbor?
[01:12:23.940 --> 01:12:24.900]   What?
[01:12:24.900 --> 01:12:25.860]   Good fences.
[01:12:25.860 --> 01:12:26.340]   Yep.
[01:12:26.340 --> 01:12:27.620]   That's exactly right.
[01:12:27.620 --> 01:12:28.100]   That's exactly right.
[01:12:28.100 --> 01:12:31.220]   You know, don't ask for trouble and proactive.
[01:12:31.220 --> 01:12:33.060]   And the thing is, a lot of times we get stopped.
[01:12:33.060 --> 01:12:34.420]   I mean, I come from a family of lawyers.
[01:12:34.420 --> 01:12:35.780]   And so you get stopped.
[01:12:35.780 --> 01:12:37.380]   Even I get stopped about one.
[01:12:37.380 --> 01:12:39.780]   You know, it's going to be expensive and everything else.
[01:12:39.780 --> 01:12:44.500]   And being able to find something that's going to tie some of these materials up is so important
[01:12:44.500 --> 01:12:45.140]   at the beginning.
[01:12:45.140 --> 01:12:45.540]   Yes.
[01:12:45.540 --> 01:12:47.540]   Not when you're in conflict.
[01:12:47.540 --> 01:12:49.140]   You have to do it when you're all friends.
[01:12:49.140 --> 01:12:50.260]   That's when you want to make the agreement.
[01:12:50.260 --> 01:12:51.940]   I like it.
[01:12:51.940 --> 01:12:54.420]   LegalZoom.com.

[01:13:08.820 --> 01:13:16.340]   I don't know if there's a whole lot more to talk about.
[01:13:16.340 --> 01:13:17.940]   What else should we talk about?
[01:13:17.940 --> 01:13:19.380]   Anybody got anything here?
[01:13:19.380 --> 01:13:20.900]   Iowa 7-1.
[01:13:20.900 --> 01:13:22.820]   It's going to come out in March.
[01:13:22.820 --> 01:13:23.620]   It's not going to come out.
[01:13:23.620 --> 01:13:24.180]   It is going to.
[01:13:24.180 --> 01:13:24.580]   It's not.
[01:13:24.580 --> 01:13:26.020]   It is going to come out in March.
[01:13:26.020 --> 01:13:27.060]   There's no GM yet.
[01:13:27.060 --> 01:13:30.340]   And there's no final seat for developers yet.
[01:13:30.340 --> 01:13:31.220]   GM candidate.
[01:13:31.220 --> 01:13:32.820]   So it means March probably, huh?
[01:13:32.820 --> 01:13:33.060]   Yeah.
[01:13:33.060 --> 01:13:38.180]   But do you think the beta 5 have you heard from your sources?
[01:13:38.180 --> 01:13:43.220]   Is good enough to get the job done?
[01:13:43.220 --> 01:13:48.500]   I haven't seen anyone throwing their phones into the river and outside the forest.
[01:13:48.500 --> 01:13:51.700]   I think it is much needed.
[01:13:51.700 --> 01:13:54.180]   I don't think they should delay it too much longer.
[01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:58.580]   I think they should have put out a 7.0.5 for everybody that fixed a lot of the lingering bugs already.
[01:13:58.580 --> 01:14:00.660]   Way too long for a 7.1.
[01:14:00.660 --> 01:14:02.660]   Perhaps have been waiting a little too long.
[01:14:02.660 --> 01:14:10.900]   No, just this morning, I was reading, doing some reading on my iPad and my iPad restarted twice.
[01:14:10.900 --> 01:14:11.940]   Oh.
[01:14:11.940 --> 01:14:13.460]   And it's like, oh, that's bad.
[01:14:13.460 --> 01:14:15.140]   Isn't that frustrating?
[01:14:15.140 --> 01:14:16.180]   So it's happening to you too.
[01:14:16.180 --> 01:14:17.300]   Yeah.
[01:14:17.300 --> 01:14:22.580]   And I don't blame anything larger than, again, the scale of what they were trying to do with
[01:14:23.300 --> 01:14:28.020]   iOS 7, but it's like, oh, man, I remember when this never, ever happened.
[01:14:28.020 --> 01:14:31.620]   I was so the, where the last time that this had, this would have happened would have been so long ago.
[01:14:31.620 --> 01:14:32.500]   I couldn't even remember it.
[01:14:32.500 --> 01:14:32.740]   Yeah.
[01:14:32.740 --> 01:14:34.980]   So it's not unreliable, but it's just unfortunate.
[01:14:34.980 --> 01:14:41.060]   Unfortunately, this is a humanizing moment for iOS 7 that I hope you're amazing.
[01:14:41.060 --> 01:14:42.020]   That's what 7.1.
[01:14:42.020 --> 01:14:42.420]   Yeah.
[01:14:42.420 --> 01:14:44.180]   Every respring is a punch in your apple heart.
[01:14:44.180 --> 01:14:49.620]   It's like, it's like, it's like, we have a table.
[01:14:50.900 --> 01:14:55.300]   It's like when you, when you see your favorite action star, when he knows he doesn't have
[01:14:55.300 --> 01:14:59.860]   another movie coming up for another four months, he's like, oh, he doesn't always have those rippling
[01:14:59.860 --> 01:15:01.060]   abs and that suntan.
[01:15:01.060 --> 01:15:04.020]   That really is only something that he has when it's time for OK.
[01:15:04.020 --> 01:15:05.620]   He is human after all.
[01:15:05.620 --> 01:15:06.740]   Yeah.
[01:15:06.740 --> 01:15:07.060]   OK.
[01:15:07.060 --> 01:15:10.180]   When you find out your father didn't know the answer to that one question.
[01:15:10.180 --> 01:15:11.140]   Oh.
[01:15:11.140 --> 01:15:16.980]   Or when he, when he finds out that this is, when he, like, cooking temperatures for like
[01:15:16.980 --> 01:15:21.700]   pork were recently reduced, like by the, by the USDA, like three years ago.
[01:15:21.700 --> 01:15:25.940]   And I always used to hate like my mother's pork chops, but now I'm cooking them at like,
[01:15:25.940 --> 01:15:28.980]   and so I thought I hated pork and now I'm cooking with the right temperature and like,
[01:15:28.980 --> 01:15:31.540]   oh, my mom didn't know everything about how to cook.
[01:15:31.540 --> 01:15:36.660]   This is, this is moist and tender and delicious and flavorful instead of tough and leathery.
[01:15:36.660 --> 01:15:39.300]   Oh, oh, no.
[01:15:39.300 --> 01:15:42.820]   She could, she could have made use of this information had she had it, but she didn't have it.
[01:15:42.820 --> 01:15:43.140]   OK.
[01:15:43.140 --> 01:15:44.180]   Oh.
[01:15:46.180 --> 01:15:49.460]   Um, let's see.
[01:15:49.460 --> 01:15:51.780]   And flappy birds.
[01:15:51.780 --> 01:15:52.900]   We haven't really mentioned it.
[01:15:52.900 --> 01:15:54.020]   The latest.
[01:15:54.020 --> 01:15:56.420]   Is there any new now?
[01:15:56.420 --> 01:15:59.300]   I think we need a special logo.
[01:15:59.300 --> 01:16:00.500]   Flappy Bird.
[01:16:00.500 --> 01:16:01.700]   America held hostage.
[01:16:01.700 --> 01:16:02.500]   Day 14.
[01:16:02.500 --> 01:16:05.380]   We're not talking about Bob Costas's eye infection.
[01:16:05.380 --> 01:16:07.460]   A national news story, but fine.
[01:16:07.460 --> 01:16:11.060]   If you want to have your click grabby sort of headline about flappy bird.
[01:16:11.060 --> 01:16:11.940]   Flappy Bird.
[01:16:11.940 --> 01:16:14.740]   I tuned into twit breaking news and I didn't see it.
[01:16:14.740 --> 01:16:16.100]   I was just broken hearted.
[01:16:16.100 --> 01:16:23.140]   So the latest is that Forbes sent a Vietnamese speaking reported to Hanoi to speak to Dong Nguyen.
[01:16:23.140 --> 01:16:26.740]   I don't need to explain the flappy bird flap.
[01:16:26.740 --> 01:16:27.540]   Do I?
[01:16:27.540 --> 01:16:29.140]   Well, we should probably catch everybody up.
[01:16:29.140 --> 01:16:30.260]   Would you catch everybody up?
[01:16:30.260 --> 01:16:32.020]   I'm I've done it so many times now.
[01:16:32.020 --> 01:16:32.580]   I'm sick of it.
[01:16:32.580 --> 01:16:34.420]   Lappy Bird was, was it was?
[01:16:34.420 --> 01:16:34.980]   Well, at least.
[01:16:34.980 --> 01:16:37.940]   Flappy Bird was something you tell your grandkids about.
[01:16:37.940 --> 01:16:38.260]   Yes.
[01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:41.380]   The the the the the day that flappy bird ended.
[01:16:41.380 --> 01:16:43.540]   So I get very, very difficult game evidently.
[01:16:43.540 --> 01:16:48.180]   I have not played it, but I did download it because it was because I found out that it was going to be gone.
[01:16:48.180 --> 01:16:50.740]   Constrained resources causes and increased demand.
[01:16:50.740 --> 01:16:52.660]   But you know, it picked up.
[01:16:52.660 --> 01:16:57.300]   It became very I think that there was a reporter or a YouTube channel.
[01:16:57.300 --> 01:17:01.940]   I think that really talked about it and pushed it into a well into a.
[01:17:01.940 --> 01:17:06.340]   There is some speculation that what pushed it came out in May, you know,
[01:17:06.340 --> 01:17:08.820]   right that what pushed it into the top of the.
[01:17:08.820 --> 01:17:11.060]   I'm sorry.
[01:17:11.060 --> 01:17:11.620]   Hold on a second.
[01:17:11.620 --> 01:17:12.740]   Oh, what pushed it.
[01:17:13.620 --> 01:17:15.540]   I'm pushing it.
[01:17:15.540 --> 01:17:16.580]   You only have to just say,
[01:17:16.580 --> 01:17:17.060]   Flappy Bird.
[01:17:17.060 --> 01:17:25.620]   No, I'm pushing the top was that somebody bought perhaps some reviews because all of a sudden
[01:17:25.620 --> 01:17:28.020]   reviews started appearing for Flappy Bird in December.
[01:17:28.020 --> 01:17:32.500]   And the reviews be ramped up quite quickly and then tapered off.
[01:17:32.500 --> 01:17:36.100]   And then ramped up again because people started using it.
[01:17:36.100 --> 01:17:39.220]   If you look at the early reviews, there was very certain similarity to them.
[01:17:39.220 --> 01:17:41.460]   That is a little bit of a giveaway.
[01:17:41.460 --> 01:17:46.420]   So in also Dong Nguyen, the developer has three apps, all three of which started
[01:17:46.420 --> 01:17:47.700]   getting reviews in December.
[01:17:47.700 --> 01:17:51.220]   Only one of which caught on the rest just faded away again.
[01:17:51.220 --> 01:17:56.180]   And Flappy Bird obviously had the wings to make it as a real viral success.
[01:17:56.180 --> 01:17:58.420]   So it did go viral thanks to this strategy.
[01:17:58.420 --> 01:18:03.380]   Nobody suspects that those downloads aren't real because all you have to do is look around you.
[01:18:03.380 --> 01:18:06.260]   Everybody's playing the stupid game.
[01:18:08.420 --> 01:18:13.060]   By the way, Paul Therat has the highest high score of anybody in the Twitch family.
[01:18:13.060 --> 01:18:13.700]   What's his high score?
[01:18:13.700 --> 01:18:17.940]   You want to guess what Paul Therat's high score is just at, you know, 17.
[01:18:17.940 --> 01:18:18.580]   No.
[01:18:18.580 --> 01:18:25.700]   Paul has 131 points.
[01:18:25.700 --> 01:18:27.860]   But there are others of us.
[01:18:27.860 --> 01:18:29.780]   I have five.
[01:18:29.780 --> 01:18:33.940]   I just don't know what the selling point of this game is because everybody who recommends it or
[01:18:33.940 --> 01:18:39.380]   talks about talks about this is a stupidest, most frustrating, awful trolling game I've ever
[01:18:39.380 --> 01:18:40.420]   played in my entire life.
[01:18:40.420 --> 01:18:41.540]   But you can't stop playing it.
[01:18:41.540 --> 01:18:42.100]   That's why.
[01:18:42.100 --> 01:18:44.500]   So why would I want to download it then?
[01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:46.020]   You know, they have a game.
[01:18:46.020 --> 01:18:47.300]   I want to have fun when I play games.
[01:18:47.300 --> 01:18:48.660]   They have a game like that in real life.
[01:18:48.660 --> 01:18:49.380]   It's called golf.
[01:18:49.380 --> 01:18:52.260]   Yeah, it's pretty much like golf.
[01:18:52.260 --> 01:18:52.580]   It is.
[01:18:52.580 --> 01:18:55.460]   It is like, yeah, you fail most of the time.
[01:18:55.460 --> 01:19:00.420]   You're mostly frustrated and every once in a while, you just get a tinge that you might
[01:19:00.420 --> 01:19:01.540]   not be a complete failure.
[01:19:01.540 --> 01:19:03.460]   And then you decide you have to play it over and over and over.
[01:19:03.460 --> 01:19:05.300]   But at least you're at least you're outside.
[01:19:05.300 --> 01:19:06.580]   You might even see it.
[01:19:06.580 --> 01:19:07.380]   It's an exercise.
[01:19:07.380 --> 01:19:09.940]   You argue to yourself that you're getting a tan and some exercise,
[01:19:09.940 --> 01:19:12.100]   except that you're driving around in a cart.
[01:19:12.100 --> 01:19:13.220]   A good walk ruined.
[01:19:13.220 --> 01:19:17.220]   And sometimes a girl comes up in another cart and sells you beer.
[01:19:17.220 --> 01:19:17.940]   Okay.
[01:19:17.940 --> 01:19:20.180]   I don't see where this is a valid company.
[01:19:20.180 --> 01:19:24.500]   But you know, my family's golf course has a cannon.
[01:19:24.500 --> 01:19:25.620]   What?
[01:19:25.620 --> 01:19:27.060]   A beer cannon?
[01:19:27.060 --> 01:19:28.500]   No, it's just a regular cannon.
[01:19:28.500 --> 01:19:28.900]   Does it?
[01:19:28.900 --> 01:19:30.180]   In carbide?
[01:19:30.180 --> 01:19:31.220]   What?
[01:19:31.220 --> 01:19:31.860]   Carbide?
[01:19:31.860 --> 01:19:32.580]   Carbide cannon.
[01:19:32.580 --> 01:19:33.060]   It's big cannon.
[01:19:33.060 --> 01:19:33.780]   No, no, it's a full cannon.
[01:19:33.780 --> 01:19:34.580]   No, it's not carbide cannon.
[01:19:34.580 --> 01:19:35.380]   It's a big cannon.
[01:19:35.380 --> 01:19:36.100]   It is a big cannon.
[01:19:36.100 --> 01:19:37.380]   We just don't put cannon balls in it.
[01:19:37.380 --> 01:19:38.740]   It's a vitty golf course.
[01:19:38.740 --> 01:19:40.900]   It's like, I mean, you can hear it for miles when they set it out.
[01:19:40.900 --> 01:19:42.260]   When they do, when they do the shotguns.
[01:19:42.260 --> 01:19:44.100]   Why are you getting invaded by this?
[01:19:44.100 --> 01:19:45.220]   When you do a shotgun start.
[01:19:45.220 --> 01:19:48.980]   So what happens is that when you have a tournament, you put everybody on.
[01:19:48.980 --> 01:19:51.140]   You put everybody on all the different holes.
[01:19:51.140 --> 01:19:51.620]   Sure.
[01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:54.900]   You know, you're not starting one at a time, but it's called a shotgun start.
[01:19:54.900 --> 01:19:56.820]   And so, so then they, you know,
[01:19:56.820 --> 01:19:59.060]   something that everybody on all 18 holes can hear me.
[01:19:59.060 --> 01:20:00.020]   And you can hear that.
[01:20:00.020 --> 01:20:00.500]   Nine holes.
[01:20:00.500 --> 01:20:01.060]   It's 18.
[01:20:01.060 --> 01:20:01.620]   It's 18.
[01:20:01.620 --> 01:20:03.620]   It's a big, it's a big, it's a really nice golf course.
[01:20:03.620 --> 01:20:05.700]   You have a family 18 hole golf course.
[01:20:05.700 --> 01:20:07.140]   You had a farm that wasn't making any money.
[01:20:07.140 --> 01:20:09.060]   So the best thing to do with a farm that does not make any money,
[01:20:09.060 --> 01:20:12.180]   if you don't have Marcel Lacheyle is, is make a golf course out of it.
[01:20:12.180 --> 01:20:14.180]   Do you charge people for use?
[01:20:14.180 --> 01:20:15.780]   I mean, can like people strangers use it?
[01:20:15.780 --> 01:20:16.980]   Public golf course.
[01:20:16.980 --> 01:20:17.940]   It's a public golf course.
[01:20:17.940 --> 01:20:20.340]   It's considered one of the best in western Pennsylvania.
[01:20:20.340 --> 01:20:20.980]   So it's a business.
[01:20:20.980 --> 01:20:22.420]   Pittsburgh Steelers come by and play.
[01:20:22.420 --> 01:20:23.300]   The Pittsburgh Steelers.
[01:20:23.300 --> 01:20:25.140]   Do you use the cannon on the Pittsburgh Steelers?
[01:20:25.140 --> 01:20:26.980]   Only if they're there for a shotgun start.
[01:20:28.420 --> 01:20:29.860]   Then they play bagpipes to it.
[01:20:29.860 --> 01:20:32.420]   Now you know why they're all lawyers in his family.
[01:20:32.420 --> 01:20:35.220]   My brother runs it.
[01:20:35.220 --> 01:20:41.860]   It is the craziest golf course ever because you just got to go to birdsfoot.com just to
[01:20:41.860 --> 01:20:50.420]   sign out for the newsletter just so you can get my brother's emails.
[01:20:50.420 --> 01:20:56.020]   Like the emails he sends out are the funniest emails that any company sends there to see.
[01:20:56.020 --> 01:20:57.220]   The birdsfoot story.
[01:20:57.460 --> 01:20:58.980]   Wow.
[01:20:58.980 --> 01:21:04.020]   Is there a picture of the cannon on the what do they have the the the commercial?
[01:21:04.020 --> 01:21:05.620]   So my brother Joe, this is the home.
[01:21:05.620 --> 01:21:06.820]   Is this the bird's foot story?
[01:21:06.820 --> 01:21:07.780]   Is this the commercial?
[01:21:07.780 --> 01:21:08.740]   Uh, it might be.
[01:21:08.740 --> 01:21:09.460]   Click to view.
[01:21:09.460 --> 01:21:13.220]   Oh, they see that's my the whole family.
[01:21:13.220 --> 01:21:14.100]   Here's the whole family.
[01:21:14.100 --> 01:21:15.700]   Boots, foot golf course.
[01:21:15.700 --> 01:21:16.740]   It's morning afternoons.
[01:21:16.740 --> 01:21:17.300]   Isn't that nice?
[01:21:17.300 --> 01:21:17.860]   Isn't it nice in the day?
[01:21:17.860 --> 01:21:18.500]   Is that your brother?
[01:21:18.500 --> 01:21:19.140]   Seems like five times.
[01:21:19.140 --> 01:21:20.740]   No, that's just one of our one of our.
[01:21:20.740 --> 01:21:22.260]   It's just like a half a world.
[01:21:22.260 --> 01:21:24.180]   When we bring people here for the first time.
[01:21:24.180 --> 01:21:25.620]   We shoot them with the cats, my dad.
[01:21:25.620 --> 01:21:27.300]   Is that how birdsfoot is.
[01:21:27.300 --> 01:21:29.540]   Tells the story.
[01:21:29.540 --> 01:21:31.780]   How can I do a whole hour on triangulation with you?
[01:21:31.780 --> 01:21:32.580]   And this did that.
[01:21:32.580 --> 01:21:33.140]   I know.
[01:21:33.140 --> 01:21:33.860]   I don't know.
[01:21:33.860 --> 01:21:34.420]   Come on.
[01:21:34.420 --> 01:21:36.580]   First would have built one brother's bank and movie.
[01:21:36.580 --> 01:21:38.260]   Another brother goes to call for me.
[01:21:38.260 --> 01:21:38.580]   Yes.
[01:21:38.580 --> 01:21:39.780]   When you come out of here.
[01:21:39.780 --> 01:21:41.380]   That's a sit-com family right there.
[01:21:41.380 --> 01:21:41.700]   That's it.
[01:21:41.700 --> 01:21:45.380]   I'm telling you arrested development in real life.
[01:21:45.380 --> 01:21:46.100]   Exactly.
[01:21:46.100 --> 01:21:49.380]   So they have the best the best movies going.
[01:21:49.380 --> 01:21:52.100]   My brother just goes out with a couple cameras and shoots these.
[01:21:52.100 --> 01:21:52.740]   He shoots this.
[01:21:52.740 --> 01:21:54.180]   My brother Joe.
[01:21:54.180 --> 01:21:54.580]   Oh, Joe.
[01:21:54.580 --> 01:21:55.780]   Yeah, we worked with Joe.
[01:21:55.780 --> 01:21:57.140]   We've used Joe as a camera man.
[01:21:57.140 --> 01:21:57.860]   Joe's a monster.
[01:21:57.860 --> 01:21:59.060]   He's using a 5D.
[01:21:59.060 --> 01:21:59.700]   He looks like here.
[01:21:59.700 --> 01:22:01.060]   I like the boat drive.
[01:22:01.060 --> 01:22:03.060]   Yeah, he did use a 5D for this.
[01:22:03.060 --> 01:22:03.460]   Yeah.
[01:22:03.460 --> 01:22:04.500]   I'm liking the boat guy.
[01:22:04.500 --> 01:22:05.300]   Well, he did a commercial.
[01:22:05.300 --> 01:22:06.420]   We used the FS 700.
[01:22:06.420 --> 01:22:08.980]   So we've got like a slow motion guy hitting a...
[01:22:08.980 --> 01:22:10.660]   He had a...
[01:22:10.660 --> 01:22:14.420]   Not many golf courses get a guy to come out and put a FS 700 shooting.
[01:22:14.420 --> 01:22:15.140]   There's a brother trap.
[01:22:15.140 --> 01:22:15.940]   That's my brother trap.
[01:22:15.940 --> 01:22:18.260]   I think that's one of the things.
[01:22:18.260 --> 01:22:19.300]   He is the funniest guy.
[01:22:19.300 --> 01:22:23.780]   The funniest guy I know.
[01:22:24.420 --> 01:22:25.780]   Who gets to drive that?
[01:22:25.780 --> 01:22:27.940]   My brother Rob actually used to drive it.
[01:22:27.940 --> 01:22:30.100]   There's a big fan.
[01:22:30.100 --> 01:22:30.580]   Who's Michelle?
[01:22:30.580 --> 01:22:31.940]   That's my cousin Michelle.
[01:22:31.940 --> 01:22:33.220]   She plays the backpipes.
[01:22:33.220 --> 01:22:34.500]   She plays the backpipes.
[01:22:34.500 --> 01:22:36.660]   She gets it out there with a kill and plays the backpipes.
[01:22:36.660 --> 01:22:37.780]   It's amazing.
[01:22:37.780 --> 01:22:38.740]   Serious question.
[01:22:38.740 --> 01:22:40.820]   Okay, this is not a joke.
[01:22:40.820 --> 01:22:41.620]   Serious question.
[01:22:41.620 --> 01:22:42.020]   Yeah.
[01:22:42.020 --> 01:22:45.300]   Have you ever pitched or been pitched for a reality show?
[01:22:45.300 --> 01:22:47.620]   I think we should do it.
[01:22:47.620 --> 01:22:51.620]   We have been pitched for a reality show because our family is crazy.
[01:22:51.620 --> 01:22:53.620]   We have great conditions here.
[01:22:53.620 --> 01:22:55.700]   Our crew takes pride in their way.
[01:22:55.700 --> 01:22:56.180]   Wow.
[01:22:56.180 --> 01:22:57.140]   Oh, it gets...
[01:22:57.140 --> 01:22:57.300]   Yeah.
[01:22:57.300 --> 01:22:59.940]   Does she wear a kill when she plays the backpipes?
[01:22:59.940 --> 01:22:59.940]   Yeah.
[01:22:59.940 --> 01:23:01.140]   She's coming in.
[01:23:01.140 --> 01:23:02.260]   And she's really good.
[01:23:02.260 --> 01:23:04.980]   They're dead on so we can have them.
[01:23:04.980 --> 01:23:06.340]   There's machinery.
[01:23:06.340 --> 01:23:07.220]   I know that.
[01:23:07.220 --> 01:23:08.500]   They spend a lot of time.
[01:23:08.500 --> 01:23:09.620]   There's my brother Rob.
[01:23:09.620 --> 01:23:10.420]   Running the machinery.
[01:23:10.420 --> 01:23:11.940]   And it shows through one of the...
[01:23:11.940 --> 01:23:12.660]   Family business.
[01:23:12.660 --> 01:23:13.860]   We call them three fingers Rob.
[01:23:13.860 --> 01:23:17.140]   Wow.
[01:23:17.140 --> 01:23:18.340]   That's a nice golf course.
[01:23:18.340 --> 01:23:19.940]   It's a really nice golf course.
[01:23:19.940 --> 01:23:21.620]   It's a pleasure to work with them every day.
[01:23:21.620 --> 01:23:25.460]   Nathan leads the charge with our maintenance of the golf course.
[01:23:25.460 --> 01:23:26.980]   That's as serious as my brother ever gets.
[01:23:26.980 --> 01:23:28.100]   This is so cute.
[01:23:28.100 --> 01:23:28.740]   This is so cute.
[01:23:28.740 --> 01:23:30.500]   You got a whole ad in everything.
[01:23:30.500 --> 01:23:31.060]   Yeah.
[01:23:31.060 --> 01:23:32.420]   That's the long version.
[01:23:32.420 --> 01:23:33.220]   Not the commercial version.
[01:23:33.220 --> 01:23:33.700]   Yeah, I know.
[01:23:33.700 --> 01:23:34.900]   I know you can cut it off.
[01:23:34.900 --> 01:23:36.340]   It's going to go on forever.
[01:23:36.340 --> 01:23:40.100]   So if you're in the Pittsburgh area, go to the Birds Foot Golf Club.
[01:23:40.100 --> 01:23:40.340]   Right.
[01:23:40.340 --> 01:23:42.020]   But you should sign up for the...
[01:23:42.020 --> 01:23:44.020]   Just to read my brother's prose.
[01:23:44.020 --> 01:23:46.900]   I really want to see a picture of the cannon.
[01:23:46.900 --> 01:23:48.580]   Oh, I don't know if they have any of the cannons.
[01:23:48.580 --> 01:23:49.060]   Yeah.
[01:23:49.060 --> 01:23:50.100]   You should show that though.
[01:23:50.100 --> 01:23:50.900]   Like how big...
[01:23:50.900 --> 01:23:53.860]   Like is it a surplus army surplus cannon?
[01:23:53.860 --> 01:23:54.340]   I don't know.
[01:23:54.340 --> 01:23:56.340]   It's someone that my brother knew of course.
[01:23:56.340 --> 01:23:57.300]   And I don't think...
[01:23:57.300 --> 01:23:58.260]   You know, I don't think he...
[01:23:58.260 --> 01:23:59.780]   I don't know if we actually own the cannon,
[01:23:59.780 --> 01:24:01.380]   but I know we bring it out and fire it.
[01:24:01.380 --> 01:24:02.340]   And it's a big cannon.
[01:24:02.340 --> 01:24:06.180]   I mean, you can hear it from my parents' house.
[01:24:06.180 --> 01:24:06.660]   Wow.
[01:24:06.660 --> 01:24:07.620]   It's miles away.
[01:24:07.620 --> 01:24:08.020]   Wow.
[01:24:08.020 --> 01:24:11.620]   Well, there we go.
[01:24:11.620 --> 01:24:12.660]   We've learned something new.
[01:24:12.660 --> 01:24:13.620]   There you go.
[01:24:13.620 --> 01:24:15.380]   Just when you thought you knew everything about me, there's cool.
[01:24:15.380 --> 01:24:18.340]   I will never learn everything there is to know about Alex Lindsay.
[01:24:18.340 --> 01:24:19.220]   That's for sure.
[01:24:19.220 --> 01:24:21.140]   Layers and pun layers upon layers.
[01:24:21.140 --> 01:24:22.180]   I don't know how we got into that.
[01:24:22.180 --> 01:24:23.620]   That's an epic...
[01:24:23.620 --> 01:24:24.420]   I don't either.
[01:24:24.420 --> 01:24:24.820]   Rathole.
[01:24:24.820 --> 01:24:27.460]   Because we were talking about...
[01:24:27.460 --> 01:24:30.420]   Oh, we're talking about flappy birds and we're talking about flappy birds.
[01:24:30.420 --> 01:24:31.380]   Okay, flappy birds.
[01:24:31.380 --> 01:24:31.780]   That's right.
[01:24:31.780 --> 01:24:32.980]   Let's get back on topic.
[01:24:32.980 --> 01:24:36.820]   Not that this is anywhere near as interested as Alex's golf course,
[01:24:36.820 --> 01:24:36.980]   but...
[01:24:36.980 --> 01:24:39.860]   So the guy who created it was,
[01:24:39.860 --> 01:24:41.620]   according to the Verge making...
[01:24:41.620 --> 01:24:44.340]   He said he told the Verge $50,000 a day on...
[01:24:44.340 --> 01:24:46.660]   It's an ad supported program.
[01:24:46.660 --> 01:24:50.660]   I can vouch for its addictiveness because everybody here plays it.
[01:24:50.660 --> 01:24:52.660]   And then I was talking to one of our interns,
[01:24:52.660 --> 01:24:54.100]   everybody in the high school,
[01:24:54.100 --> 01:24:55.700]   like within three days it downloaded.
[01:24:55.700 --> 01:24:57.620]   I mean, really is a viral hit.
[01:24:57.620 --> 01:24:59.700]   There's nobody questioning that.
[01:24:59.700 --> 01:25:00.100]   Right.
[01:25:00.100 --> 01:25:02.340]   But oddly enough last week,
[01:25:02.340 --> 01:25:04.340]   Dong Nguyen, the author tweets,
[01:25:04.340 --> 01:25:05.620]   "I can't take it anymore.
[01:25:05.620 --> 01:25:07.460]   I'm going to pull..."
[01:25:07.460 --> 01:25:08.660]   He tweeted this on Saturday.
[01:25:08.660 --> 01:25:13.460]   "Tomorrow I'm going to pull the program from both the Android and the iOS App Store."
[01:25:13.460 --> 01:25:14.980]   That's it.
[01:25:14.980 --> 01:25:16.020]   And then...
[01:25:16.020 --> 01:25:17.300]   By the way, it's not for sale,
[01:25:17.300 --> 01:25:18.820]   and yes, I still make games.
[01:25:18.820 --> 01:25:19.380]   Goodbye.
[01:25:19.380 --> 01:25:21.300]   Now I will say that the question is,
[01:25:21.300 --> 01:25:23.780]   is that a whole bunch of people must have downloaded it
[01:25:23.780 --> 01:25:24.820]   over the weekend, like me,
[01:25:24.820 --> 01:25:26.980]   and I'll eventually get around to selling it.
[01:25:26.980 --> 01:25:28.820]   It seems like it may increase the amount of money
[01:25:28.820 --> 01:25:30.180]   he's actually generating by all this.
[01:25:30.180 --> 01:25:30.740]   That's right.
[01:25:30.740 --> 01:25:32.180]   And then in a month he'll say,
[01:25:32.180 --> 01:25:34.100]   "You know what, people talk me into releasing it again."
[01:25:34.100 --> 01:25:35.860]   We don't know how much he sold...
[01:25:35.860 --> 01:25:38.980]   How many he sold on the App Store,
[01:25:38.980 --> 01:25:40.340]   because Apple doesn't give you that information.
[01:25:40.340 --> 01:25:42.980]   But on the Android, 50 million copies,
[01:25:43.620 --> 01:25:45.540]   50, five, zero million copies,
[01:25:45.540 --> 01:25:48.500]   presuming he sold maybe 150 million total,
[01:25:48.500 --> 01:25:50.900]   he's going to continue to reap the ad rewards
[01:25:50.900 --> 01:25:52.820]   as long as people continue to play that game.
[01:25:52.820 --> 01:25:54.660]   So he's made a lot of money.
[01:25:54.660 --> 01:25:55.940]   Robert Scoble agrees with you.
[01:25:55.940 --> 01:25:57.140]   He thinks it's a marketing ploy.
[01:25:57.140 --> 01:25:58.740]   He says, "In six months, watch," he'll say.
[01:25:58.740 --> 01:25:59.460]   He doesn't make any sense at all.
[01:25:59.460 --> 01:26:01.140]   From the creator of Flappy Birds.
[01:26:01.140 --> 01:26:01.940]   Because...
[01:26:01.940 --> 01:26:02.740]   "Fappy Birds."
[01:26:02.740 --> 01:26:03.460]   Yes, exactly.
[01:26:03.460 --> 01:26:04.020]   [Laughs]
[01:26:04.020 --> 01:26:06.340]   Especially with that Forbes article that says
[01:26:06.340 --> 01:26:09.620]   that one of the reasons why he pulled it was because he didn't want to be responsible
[01:26:09.620 --> 01:26:11.780]   for people becoming addicted to a game,
[01:26:11.780 --> 01:26:13.060]   and it really upset him.
[01:26:13.060 --> 01:26:14.180]   And that I do...
[01:26:14.180 --> 01:26:16.100]   I hope that proves to be true,
[01:26:16.100 --> 01:26:19.700]   because that's a really wonderful altruistic moment, a motive.
[01:26:19.700 --> 01:26:22.340]   But as soon as that thought completed itself in my head,
[01:26:22.340 --> 01:26:24.100]   I realized that, "Yeah, but you know what?
[01:26:24.100 --> 01:26:27.380]   You could have pulled the plug immediately without pre-announcing it
[01:26:27.380 --> 01:26:30.260]   if it really was upsetting you that badly,
[01:26:30.260 --> 01:26:33.220]   but no, you basically gave the entire world warning that
[01:26:33.220 --> 01:26:35.220]   you know that viral hit that everybody's talking about?
[01:26:35.220 --> 01:26:36.340]   You will not be able to get it.
[01:26:36.340 --> 01:26:39.700]   It goes into the Disney vault along with the song of the South on Monday.
[01:26:39.700 --> 01:26:41.540]   And the real problem is that it's too addicting.
[01:26:42.100 --> 01:26:44.020]   You know, that's great marketing.
[01:26:44.020 --> 01:26:46.020]   Well, there's also some other theories.
[01:26:46.020 --> 01:26:49.780]   One of his friends told Reuters
[01:26:49.780 --> 01:26:52.100]   that he pulled it off because he got a cease and desist from Nintendo.
[01:26:52.100 --> 01:26:54.980]   Apparently, he stole the columns directly from Super Mario.
[01:26:54.980 --> 01:26:56.500]   Oh, there's that.
[01:26:56.500 --> 01:26:58.100]   Maybe, maybe, or maybe not.
[01:26:58.100 --> 01:27:01.300]   I mean, and then Nintendo says, "Well, we don't know."
[01:27:01.300 --> 01:27:03.780]   They didn't deny it, but they didn't say they did it either.
[01:27:03.780 --> 01:27:10.260]   And then there's, of course, the additional point that when you make a lot of money
[01:27:11.540 --> 01:27:14.420]   in Vietnam and the number of people pointing this out to me,
[01:27:14.420 --> 01:27:16.180]   stand back because here comes a government.
[01:27:16.180 --> 01:27:20.340]   And in fact, the Forbes guy said our interview was delayed because
[01:27:20.340 --> 01:27:23.300]   Dong Nguyen-- whoops, that's a zero.
[01:27:23.300 --> 01:27:25.700]   Dong Nguyen had an interview with these
[01:27:25.700 --> 01:27:31.140]   assistant vice prime minister right before Vietnam, right before it.
[01:27:31.140 --> 01:27:32.660]   Clearly looking for tax revenues.
[01:27:32.660 --> 01:27:37.060]   So it may also be that he just-- he wanted a rough flight.
[01:27:37.060 --> 01:27:37.620]   It's more trouble than it's worth.
[01:27:37.620 --> 01:27:38.740]   Yeah, it's a lot of trouble.
[01:27:38.740 --> 01:27:41.460]   A lot of money's going to end up in the hands of the Vietnamese government.
[01:27:41.460 --> 01:27:44.020]   Maybe you just said, "You know, I think I might move to Bally."
[01:27:44.020 --> 01:27:49.620]   Or maybe it was like there's a famous story about Wadi Bulger here in Boston,
[01:27:49.620 --> 01:27:54.420]   where somebody who was sort of connected somewhere to him won the lottery.
[01:27:54.420 --> 01:27:57.380]   Like just won the mega box, like a million bucks in the lottery.
[01:27:57.380 --> 01:28:01.300]   And guess what? A week later, it turned out that I forgot to say that it was--
[01:28:01.300 --> 01:28:06.740]   I'm actually in a pool with Wadi Bulger and so the lottery should send the money to Wadi instead.
[01:28:06.740 --> 01:28:07.780]   Yes, send it to Wadi.
[01:28:07.780 --> 01:28:08.740]   Okay.
[01:28:11.380 --> 01:28:15.460]   The most interesting line from all this is I'm saying this is ruined by life.
[01:28:15.460 --> 01:28:19.700]   And it's like there's so many ways in which that just again,
[01:28:19.700 --> 01:28:22.260]   put on your smoking jacket, get a sifter of brandy,
[01:28:22.260 --> 01:28:26.420]   settle into your leather arm chair, lean back and wonder all the different ways in which--
[01:28:26.420 --> 01:28:34.740]   Here is-- there's an excellent aftermarket in phones with Flappy Bird installed on eBay.
[01:28:34.740 --> 01:28:38.020]   Here's a iPhone 5, 16 gigs with Flappy Bird.
[01:28:38.660 --> 01:28:45.540]   So far, 10-bit, $6,000, but you could shop around because there are a buy-it now for an iPhone 5
[01:28:45.540 --> 01:28:50.420]   for $1,000. All I got to say is that we get paid to work with a lot of ad agencies on
[01:28:50.420 --> 01:28:54.820]   viral marketing campaigns. This is brilliant. And none of them have been as effective as this.
[01:28:54.820 --> 01:28:59.300]   I think this is the case. You can't can viral. If you could--
[01:28:59.300 --> 01:29:03.780]   It wouldn't be viral. It wouldn't be good. It'd be chemical weapons.
[01:29:03.780 --> 01:29:07.380]   There's something magical that happens that no one really understands why.
[01:29:08.180 --> 01:29:10.260]   Right. Boy, a pipe and a dream.
[01:29:10.260 --> 01:29:11.780]   Employee a pipe and a dream, yes.
[01:29:11.780 --> 01:29:18.420]   At the same time, I mean, not everybody posts something on YouTube with the goal of becoming
[01:29:18.420 --> 01:29:23.540]   a viral sensation, where it would have made them very, very happy if their piano recital or whatever
[01:29:23.540 --> 01:29:27.780]   had gotten-- oh geez, 10,000 people thought this was really, really great. But if it's
[01:29:27.780 --> 01:29:31.060]   suddenly 5 million and now they're getting a phone call from the Jimmy Kimmel show and they're
[01:29:31.060 --> 01:29:36.020]   getting a phone call from the Today Show, and they're like, this was a-- I thought that maybe
[01:29:36.020 --> 01:29:39.540]   100 people, like my friends and their friends would see it. And now this is all everybody's
[01:29:39.540 --> 01:29:42.260]   talking about all across the country this weekend. Right.
[01:29:42.260 --> 01:29:45.300]   It's that that has the capability of freaking some people out. It's possible that--
[01:29:45.300 --> 01:29:50.580]   I do think this is in some form of marketing campaign. But it's certainly possible that he was
[01:29:50.580 --> 01:29:56.900]   just not prepared to have the viral hit of the entire globe this week. I can't-- I would much
[01:29:56.900 --> 01:30:03.700]   rather make a comfortable living in an anonymity that make a fortune as the face of this viral hit.
[01:30:03.700 --> 01:30:07.860]   I've already made a comfortable living. He's easily made over a million dollars.
[01:30:07.860 --> 01:30:10.260]   And in Vietnam, that goes a long way. So I suspect--
[01:30:10.260 --> 01:30:16.100]   Well, I'm talking in general. If you have-- there's some people that if you gave them the deal with
[01:30:16.100 --> 01:30:19.860]   the devil, but let's say a friendly devil that just expects you to make him a nice Thanksgiving
[01:30:19.860 --> 01:30:24.500]   dinner or some year, not so damn for all eternity. I'm saying, I will give you two-- I will go
[01:30:24.500 --> 01:30:29.140]   off you two different versions of success. You can either have the sort of success where you will
[01:30:29.140 --> 01:30:34.180]   do a line of apps that do very, very well and earn you a living of maybe a comfortable living about
[01:30:34.180 --> 01:30:40.260]   $130, $140,000 a year, but consistent for five years. Or I will give you that exact same amount
[01:30:40.260 --> 01:30:45.940]   of income as the viral hit of the planet. You will have one hell of a summer in which there will be
[01:30:45.940 --> 01:30:52.420]   t-shirts based on your game. There will be sitcom pitches based on your game. Everybody will know
[01:30:52.420 --> 01:30:56.100]   who you are and everything you went through to produce this game. There are a lot of people who
[01:30:56.100 --> 01:31:01.380]   would much rather say, I will take half that money if I get to have the anonymity of knowing
[01:31:01.380 --> 01:31:06.900]   who the hell I am. Interesting story on Bloomberg Business Week. The iPhone is a new international
[01:31:06.900 --> 01:31:14.580]   currency. Vernon Silver said, "During a business trip-- I live in Rome where domestic work is cheap,
[01:31:14.580 --> 01:31:23.140]   technology is expensive. One worker who was, I guess, doing his laundry or, I don't know,
[01:31:24.580 --> 01:31:30.580]   heard he was going to the States. She said, "Pick me up an iPhone and I'll take that instead of cash
[01:31:30.580 --> 01:31:35.620]   for the month's work." So he went to the Apple Store on Fifth Avenue, lining up. He says,
[01:31:35.620 --> 01:31:39.780]   "I was surrounded by shoppers speaking languages from around the world. The salesman looked stunned
[01:31:39.780 --> 01:31:46.820]   when I said I wanted just one unlocked iPhone." He said, "We just got a shipment. We got the gold
[01:31:46.820 --> 01:31:51.540]   model." He says, "It's the most popular in Europe, the easiest to resell. To my right, a man with a
[01:31:51.540 --> 01:31:55.380]   credit card from a Saudi bank was trying to buy his third and fourth phones of the day."
[01:31:55.380 --> 01:32:02.740]   So Silver says, "Make it two." There was one more step. The salesman grabbed a landline from behind
[01:32:02.740 --> 01:32:08.820]   the counter to connecting with my bank's anti-fraud department. He says, "Purchases from the store are
[01:32:08.820 --> 01:32:16.820]   red flags to the credit card companies." So apparently, this has become a currency. The iPhone is a
[01:32:16.820 --> 01:32:24.500]   currency. The priciest country, Brazil, and iPhone is worth $1,196. Jordan, Turkey, Romania,
[01:32:24.500 --> 01:32:30.980]   Greece, and Hungary all worth more than $1,000. I have to admit, I often thought about it. I just
[01:32:30.980 --> 01:32:34.820]   don't have the timer. I'm just too lazy. But I guess in and out of Africa all the time, and
[01:32:34.820 --> 01:32:39.380]   especially when something has just been released, I get a lot of emails from folks like, "Hey,
[01:32:39.380 --> 01:32:44.980]   I'll pay you 50% more than you paid for your iPad or iPhone," whatever. And it's been clear that if
[01:32:44.980 --> 01:32:49.860]   I brought in 10 iPads, I could definitely pay for my entire trip. It's called iPhone Arbitrage.
[01:32:49.860 --> 01:32:55.460]   Kyle Wiens of IFixit, we've talked to him many times, said he was in Cabo, and the dive leader
[01:32:55.460 --> 01:33:00.900]   offered free boat trips if Wiens ever returned to Mexico with iPhones, not for free, to sell at
[01:33:00.900 --> 01:33:05.380]   the US price. The price that Kyle paid for it, because there's such a markup in Mexico.
[01:33:05.380 --> 01:33:11.860]   iPhone Arbitrage. I just thought I'd go home. I just thought I'd go home. As long as you're
[01:33:11.860 --> 01:33:15.140]   planning to travel, you might want to pick up a couple of gold iPhones before you go.
[01:33:15.140 --> 01:33:16.500]   There you go. Just pack up your hand.
[01:33:16.500 --> 01:33:21.460]   Actually, it's interesting. This is a long-standing tradition. When I first went to
[01:33:21.460 --> 01:33:27.620]   Eastern Europe in the '60s, Levi's Blue jeans worth money.
[01:33:27.620 --> 01:33:35.380]   I have a lot of artwork in our office that I traded logo shirts for in Africa.
[01:33:35.380 --> 01:33:36.100]   But we were in Egypt.
[01:33:36.100 --> 01:33:38.340]   They didn't want the money. I said, "I'll pay you cash," and they're like, "No, no, we'll
[01:33:38.340 --> 01:33:41.780]   have a shirt." I can get the cash anywhere. I can't get that shirt.
[01:33:41.780 --> 01:33:47.620]   Right. When we were in Egypt, we were told in 2010, our guide said, "Next time you come back,
[01:33:47.620 --> 01:33:50.740]   bring a lot of ballpoint pens, we can't get them." The kids love them.
[01:33:50.740 --> 01:33:52.980]   I take whole packstones in Bob Boy.
[01:33:52.980 --> 01:33:55.620]   Yeah. You hand them out. Because they're cheap, big pens, they're cheap.
[01:33:55.620 --> 01:33:57.620]   And they prefer that to money.
[01:33:57.620 --> 01:34:00.740]   I keep on meaning to when I go there. I keep on meaning to get Pixacor one.
[01:34:00.740 --> 01:34:03.860]   They always remember me. Like 20 years later, they'll remember the Pixacor one.
[01:34:03.860 --> 01:34:04.500]   The Pixacor one.
[01:34:04.500 --> 01:34:08.340]   It'll be a cargo cult 20 years from now, worshipping the Pixacor.
[01:34:08.340 --> 01:34:13.700]   "Oh, the great God of Pixacor came to our land and gave us pens."
[01:34:13.700 --> 01:34:18.900]   By the way, Bitcoin, real quick. And then we're going to get to our Pixacor the week.
[01:34:18.900 --> 01:34:23.940]   Bitcoin, two things. One, Apple has killed the most popular Bitcoin wall of app in the app store.
[01:34:23.940 --> 01:34:26.900]   Apple really doesn't like Bitcoin. It doesn't like it.
[01:34:26.900 --> 01:34:28.180]   It wants no part of it right now.
[01:34:28.180 --> 01:34:31.540]   We want no part of it. And there is a Trojan you should watch out for,
[01:34:31.540 --> 01:34:37.460]   for OS X that targets your Bitcoin wallet. So watch out.
[01:34:37.460 --> 01:34:42.180]   Our show today brought, we're going to get to our Pixacor the week.
[01:34:42.180 --> 01:34:46.580]   Just a second, our show today brought to you by 99 Designs. That's my pick this week.
[01:34:46.580 --> 01:34:51.620]   99designs.com. We're having a little, we've used them before.
[01:34:51.620 --> 01:34:55.460]   This is a place to go where you need, if you need designs, if you need graphic designs for
[01:34:55.460 --> 01:35:01.140]   landing pages, websites, even like email templates, t-shirts, that's what we use it for.
[01:35:02.100 --> 01:35:07.540]   Car wraps, whatever. Apps. You know, if you've got the next Flappy Bird,
[01:35:07.540 --> 01:35:10.740]   you can write a program like nobody's business. But you have the design sense.
[01:35:10.740 --> 01:35:16.580]   99designs has the designers. 280,000 designers are waiting for you to go and pitch them.
[01:35:16.580 --> 01:35:22.500]   They call it a contest where you say, "Here's what I need." We just did one for our new hoodie.
[01:35:22.500 --> 01:35:26.500]   And we've got five designs. We actually like the design so much. We bought at least five of them.
[01:35:26.500 --> 01:35:31.380]   We've got so many great designs. And you can vote if you would like. In fact, let me, let me,
[01:35:31.380 --> 01:35:38.660]   if you go to our blog inside twit.tv, it's it's scroll down. There it is.
[01:35:38.660 --> 01:35:46.660]   There's links to the four designs. There's Design A, which is a beautiful four color design.
[01:35:46.660 --> 01:35:51.460]   Then there's the next design. You want to show them all? That's the vertical design,
[01:35:51.460 --> 01:35:56.020]   design C. Remember these letters because we're going to have you vote. Design E is stylized.
[01:35:56.020 --> 01:36:02.340]   These all came from 99designs designers. I love these. We actually couldn't choose. Design B is
[01:36:02.340 --> 01:36:07.140]   the graffiti design, which I really like. Design D is the steampunk. A lot of people really like
[01:36:07.140 --> 01:36:12.980]   this one too. So these will go on a hoodie that we will sell. You can cast your vote on our
[01:36:12.980 --> 01:36:24.100]   straw poll at straw poll.me/1079823. Wow, he's gotten into the millions now of straw polls.
[01:36:24.100 --> 01:36:33.620]   Straw poll.me/1079823. Or just go to inside.twit.tv. Actually, you need to because you want to see
[01:36:33.620 --> 01:36:37.540]   the designs before you vote because we don't have the pictures in the straw poll.
[01:36:37.540 --> 01:36:45.460]   I just love it. I just love it. 99designs.com. You connect to the great graphic designers.
[01:36:45.460 --> 01:36:51.380]   Right now, they're 2,390 open contests. So you create a contest, you say, I need a t-shirt or
[01:36:51.380 --> 01:36:56.740]   a logo or whatever. They have paid out. Last but not, they paid over $2 million to designers.
[01:36:56.740 --> 01:37:04.740]   $68 million total. It's a really great idea for a company. 99designs.com. Start your next graphic

[01:37:27.700 --> 01:37:33.540]   hoodie designs. I can't wait to see which one wins. Yeah, the straw poll seems to be down.
[01:37:33.540 --> 01:37:38.900]   I think we kill it every time we do this. Let's get our picks of the week. If we can do them fairly
[01:37:38.900 --> 01:37:42.820]   quickly, that would be nice. Andy and I'll call we shall start with you. Real quick,
[01:37:42.820 --> 01:37:47.380]   because this is, I'm not sure if I've actually recommended this one before. This is a
[01:37:48.180 --> 01:37:52.900]   back tubes, which is my favorite YouTube downloader for Mac. I was just this morning.
[01:37:52.900 --> 01:37:59.860]   I can't drag the window in. John Syracuse posted video to this lightning fast F1 Ferrari
[01:37:59.860 --> 01:38:05.380]   tire change pitstop. And it was so fast, I really wanted to look at it in greater detail, but it
[01:38:05.380 --> 01:38:14.740]   was going too fast. So Mac tubes can pretty much get any, sorry, I've screwed up my monitor setup.
[01:38:14.740 --> 01:38:18.420]   But the idea is that you just get the URL from the top of the address bar,
[01:38:18.420 --> 01:38:23.780]   plug it into Mac tubes. It will let you either watch the video or via a little pop up in the
[01:38:23.780 --> 01:38:28.100]   corner of the screen. It will show you all the different video files that are hosted on YouTube.
[01:38:28.100 --> 01:38:33.460]   Excuse me, the actual source video files, I'll let you download the HD version, the SD version
[01:38:33.460 --> 01:38:38.660]   of it. If you want the really awful open source compression version, let's get that. The idea,
[01:38:38.660 --> 01:38:42.740]   though, that now you can have a, now it's a quick time file that's on your desktop that you can
[01:38:42.740 --> 01:38:47.700]   then watch. And then there are lots of, there's also lots of stuff on YouTube that are like
[01:38:47.700 --> 01:38:53.460]   1970s TV shows that are technically not out of copyright, but nobody is claiming them.
[01:38:53.460 --> 01:38:59.140]   And so if you're going to, if you're going to be able to watch this old like Tony Randall TV show
[01:38:59.140 --> 01:39:03.700]   of which there were four episodes, this is your only opportunity to do it, which is to watch it
[01:39:03.700 --> 01:39:08.100]   on YouTube. And you can also download it in case it goes away later on. So I use it all the time
[01:39:08.100 --> 01:39:12.660]   for stuff like that. And also, again, I really need a super slow-mo through a Ferrari pit change.
[01:39:12.660 --> 01:39:18.740]   It's free. It's an open, I believe it's a creative commons or open source project,
[01:39:18.740 --> 01:39:23.940]   or at least a lot of the sources of it are common, common or open source. I've been using it for
[01:39:23.940 --> 01:39:30.740]   years. So very, very quiet little app, but it works great. Very nice. Mac tubes. Always good to
[01:39:30.740 --> 01:39:34.420]   have some way to get those videos. Renee Richie, your pick of the week.
[01:39:37.140 --> 01:39:44.420]   Oops, you're muted, dude. Unmute. Sorry. My pick of the week is threes. You might not like me
[01:39:44.420 --> 01:39:48.580]   for recommending it because I can't stop playing it. I've been losing sleep over it, but it's a load
[01:39:48.580 --> 01:39:55.780]   of fun. I play this in lieu of floppy bird. Much more satisfying than floppy birds. Absolutely.
[01:39:55.780 --> 01:40:00.500]   So basically the red and the blue numbers you can combine together. So two and one makes three.
[01:40:00.500 --> 01:40:04.660]   Then you can combine any pairs. So for example, there's two twelves there. I could combine those.
[01:40:04.660 --> 01:40:10.260]   I could combine two threes and you want to basically get the highest number you can. Every time you
[01:40:10.260 --> 01:40:15.940]   combine something, its value goes up. It's a lot of fun. I wouldn't say it's a math game. Some people
[01:40:15.940 --> 01:40:20.260]   call it a math game, but you're really just adding some matching game with numbers. Yeah, absolutely.
[01:40:20.260 --> 01:40:25.060]   You play it. It's again, you have one chance as soon as you run out of as soon as the screen is
[01:40:25.060 --> 01:40:30.340]   full and you can no longer match any tiles. The game is over. I've gotten to about 9,000. Some
[01:40:30.340 --> 01:40:37.460]   people in my game center, Q or like 27,000, something like that. It's quick. So you can get in and out.
[01:40:37.460 --> 01:40:42.260]   It's incredibly fun. It's addictive in the right way. It's not maddening. It's actually
[01:40:42.260 --> 01:40:49.860]   enjoyable. And it filled that floppy bird hole in my heart. It is the greatest game ever. Brian
[01:40:49.860 --> 01:40:54.580]   brush would show it to me on Twitter. I recommended it yesterday and I'm at the day. It is very
[01:40:54.580 --> 01:40:58.820]   addictive and very hard to stop. And the best thing about it, there's no in-app purchases. There's no
[01:40:58.820 --> 01:41:02.900]   in-app ads. They just ask you for a small amount of money upfront and then just let you play.
[01:41:02.900 --> 01:41:07.860]   What are you showing their Chad? Please, you've been in bed wherever you want.
[01:41:07.860 --> 01:41:15.140]   Yeah, this is a new viral way of sharing stuff. It's a gift that just plays over and over again.
[01:41:15.140 --> 01:41:21.860]   So I've been seeing this on Google plus. It's in effect an ad for three. It's on their website.
[01:41:21.860 --> 01:41:26.820]   And it's just a gift so they could throw it absolutely anywhere. Very clever. And it kind of shows how
[01:41:26.820 --> 01:41:33.540]   it works and everything. This is the thinking person's flappy bird. And it is spreading just
[01:41:33.540 --> 01:41:38.580]   about as fast. Is something about it? It's really satisfying. And I hope more developers take up
[01:41:38.580 --> 01:41:42.340]   this model because it shows you can have a successful game without doing incredibly. It's not freemium.
[01:41:42.340 --> 01:41:49.860]   It's about 99. And that's it. Knowing app purchases. Oh boy. Gosh. I pray this is a success. Alex
[01:41:49.860 --> 01:41:54.900]   Lindsey, your pick of the week looks like a cable. I got a cable. It turns out I think Thunderbolt is
[01:41:54.900 --> 01:42:02.500]   the future. No. So I hesitated to recommend anything in this area for a while or because I really
[01:42:02.500 --> 01:42:06.500]   wanted to test a lot of the stuff. So one of the hardest things to do with what we do with live
[01:42:06.500 --> 01:42:13.780]   streaming Hangouts and so on and so forth is getting regular video. So cameras, your HDMI
[01:42:13.780 --> 01:42:19.620]   camera or your SDI camera or your switcher into Wirecast or Hangouts or Skype or whatever.
[01:42:20.500 --> 01:42:26.260]   And we have a lot of different interfaces. And we have kind of decided that this is not the only
[01:42:26.260 --> 01:42:31.540]   one we use but definitely the one we're using now the most which is the Blackmagic Ultra Studio
[01:42:31.540 --> 01:42:37.860]   Mini Recorder. I hold it in my hands now, Mr. Chad. So you can show the world. So this is about $150.
[01:42:37.860 --> 01:42:42.740]   It's tiny. It's tiny. It's you just have a Thunderbolt. So you need a Thunderbolt computer. But you can
[01:42:42.740 --> 01:42:48.180]   take STI or HDMI. You plug the Thunderbolt in. So this comes from the computer like my Mac Pro.
[01:42:48.180 --> 01:42:52.260]   Let's say. And you plug it in. And you plug it in. And the video interface, the Apple video interface.
[01:42:52.260 --> 01:42:55.860]   And it does. That'll, that'll, they had to reverse engineer this, you know.
[01:42:55.860 --> 01:43:03.060]   There's the box for it. So the, so it is, it's a Thunderbolt to, and it's SDI to and and
[01:43:03.060 --> 01:43:10.500]   and HDMI or and or HDMI to Thunderbolt. So the, so it's basically just a very inexpensive way for
[01:43:10.500 --> 01:43:15.940]   you to get either your switcher output or your camera output, whether it's a little HDMI camera
[01:43:15.940 --> 01:43:22.580]   or a or an SDI camera or SDI feed into your computer. And so you would hook, okay. Oh,
[01:43:22.580 --> 01:43:26.820]   into your computer. So that's what that way you want to get your video camera. Let's say your,
[01:43:26.820 --> 01:43:30.900]   your G 10 like these little cameras that you can. Oh, it comes this way. Yeah, it goes in. It goes
[01:43:30.900 --> 01:43:35.540]   this way. Yeah, exactly. So it goes in the SDI or HDMI port and out the Thunderbolt port.
[01:43:35.540 --> 01:43:40.180]   Into your computer. So that whether, and this will just show up on your Hangouts on Sky. Do we use
[01:43:40.180 --> 01:43:47.220]   these John? He says we tried it for Tom.
[01:43:47.220 --> 01:43:54.260]   Compatibility with Skype. Oh, Skype doesn't like. So a lot of Blackmagic stuff Skype doesn't see
[01:43:54.260 --> 01:43:58.340]   for some reason. We haven't figured that out. Why? Well, to play with, we don't do Skype very
[01:43:58.340 --> 01:44:01.220]   much. We're mostly doing Hangouts. That's our company works with our apps though. Works great
[01:44:01.220 --> 01:44:07.380]   with our TC and all that. Yeah. And and so and we use two different ones. We use the AJA IO XT.
[01:44:08.180 --> 01:44:11.380]   The reason we like the AJA IO XT is because AJA has a great
[01:44:11.380 --> 01:44:16.660]   interface that lets us know what the video pipe is. And that's not what you get with this. But
[01:44:16.660 --> 01:44:22.420]   this is one tenth the price. So, you know, so we have, so we use both of those. Most kids will
[01:44:22.420 --> 01:44:25.540]   have one of one of the other and we'll use this. But if we're having any trouble, we'll put the
[01:44:25.540 --> 01:44:30.180]   IO XT in, but the IO XT is bigger and some more sensitive and so on and so forth. So it's,
[01:44:30.180 --> 01:44:34.020]   so anyway, that's the Ultra Studio Mini recorder. But if you're trying to get started and you want
[01:44:34.020 --> 01:44:39.940]   something inexpensive to get your your video in for live streaming, this is a great solution.
[01:44:39.940 --> 01:44:45.060]   So, you know, have you seen, thank you, that is from Blackmagic Ultra Studio Mini recorder.
[01:44:45.060 --> 01:44:47.220]   How much? 145.
[01:44:47.220 --> 01:44:52.900]   And I was just going to ask you about this. Uber conferences begin a lot of press lately.
[01:44:52.900 --> 01:44:56.740]   Just start testing it. This is WebRTC. In other words, it's Google Hangout compatible.
[01:44:56.740 --> 01:45:02.980]   Conferencing. Well, or not. I haven't done, I haven't used the Uber conference from the from the video.
[01:45:03.860 --> 01:45:07.780]   I've been using the phone version. I was saying phone calls in Uber conference.
[01:45:07.780 --> 01:45:13.220]   The Uber conference phone is just awesome. And they have these, what's really cool is the
[01:45:13.220 --> 01:45:18.260]   funniest song, you know, it's I'm waiting on the conference call, you know, like, they use that
[01:45:18.260 --> 01:45:24.500]   we enjoy. There's no pin which drives me crazy. I hate pins. So by the way, I do too, because you
[01:45:24.500 --> 01:45:28.500]   always I'm on get the number then you got to go, Oh, what's the pin? Well, and the problem is you
[01:45:28.500 --> 01:45:32.580]   can't just click on something and get there. And I'm on probably five or six conference calls a day.
[01:45:32.580 --> 01:45:36.980]   You get a phone number. So it's your call. So Uber conference works great. They now have
[01:45:36.980 --> 01:45:42.740]   integration with Hangout. So you can have you can have people in a Hangout, but then one of the
[01:45:42.740 --> 01:45:47.380]   people can be a phone call to Uber conference. And then you can be integrating. So it's not doing
[01:45:47.380 --> 01:45:52.900]   video then not that I know of. Okay, but it but it but it uses Hangouts as the back end.
[01:45:52.900 --> 01:45:56.340]   Well, you can now integrate it with Hangouts. Uber conference works on its own as well. So
[01:45:56.340 --> 01:45:59.460]   Uber conference can just go there and I have the pro plan. So I can have a hundred people
[01:45:59.460 --> 01:46:02.900]   10 bucks a month. It's 10 bucks a month. It's nothing. And so there's a free plan that is
[01:46:02.900 --> 01:46:07.780]   actually does a lot of free plan does 10 10 people. So for most people, that's fine. We do a lot of
[01:46:07.780 --> 01:46:11.860]   things that require a lot of people wanted to ask you about. Yeah. So I like a lot of wrestling.
[01:46:11.860 --> 01:46:17.380]   So we're experimenting with this mostly because it integrates with Hangouts and we're always looking
[01:46:17.380 --> 01:46:22.180]   at anything that touches Hangouts. We pay a lot of attention to. We have like six pro accounts
[01:46:22.180 --> 01:46:31.780]   with go to meetings. So and then we also use team speak. And so but for this is one of the easiest
[01:46:31.780 --> 01:46:35.940]   ones and because it ties into Hangouts, it's a great solution. So I just wanted to mention
[01:46:35.940 --> 01:46:41.540]   that congregate if you didn't get to play Flappy Bird at all, congregate with a K has a flappy
[01:46:41.540 --> 01:46:46.660]   flash flappy that you can play and I'll wait a minute. Was it exactly the same? It's exactly the
[01:46:46.660 --> 01:46:50.500]   same. It's funny. It's a lot of clones too. Yeah, there's a lot of clones. But I mean,
[01:46:50.500 --> 01:46:55.220]   this is exactly the same. It's like Flappy Bird online. I don't know. Actually, there's a ton of
[01:46:55.220 --> 01:47:00.420]   them on Flappy Bird. I mean, on the congregate, there's more than one. So that's weird. But I was
[01:47:00.420 --> 01:47:04.260]   just playing it. I don't know what happened. Oh, I have to watch an ad. That's why. Anyway,
[01:47:04.260 --> 01:47:10.020]   if you really say, what was this all about? I wouldn't if I were you. You're part of a high school
[01:47:10.020 --> 01:47:16.180]   history class in 10 years. Yeah. Flow. There's one Flappy Bird died IO. That's good. Thank you,
[01:47:16.180 --> 01:47:24.660]   chat room. This is from SJF and six. Oh, there it is. Forget congregate. Just do flappy bird.io.
[01:47:24.660 --> 01:47:30.340]   That's pretty much the same, isn't it? Is it getting any? Are you getting any sound? No.
[01:47:30.340 --> 01:47:36.900]   Oh, are you getting me? That made me be my my machine. And I guess they paid for it with that
[01:47:36.900 --> 01:47:43.860]   little Amazon ad in the right there. That's Max McDonald. Oh, good kid. Enough of that.
[01:47:43.860 --> 01:47:47.220]   Ladies and gentlemen, thank you all for being here. Thank you to Andy and I code the Chicago
[01:47:47.220 --> 01:47:51.700]   Sun times, my friend. Great to see you again. And your little robot dentist friend.
[01:47:51.700 --> 01:47:57.780]   We thank Andy for being here. We thank Alex Lindsey for joining us with his golf club in canon.
[01:47:57.780 --> 01:48:02.340]   I want video of the canon. Okay, we'll work on that. We'll get some video in the canon.
[01:48:02.340 --> 01:48:08.980]   Pixel core.com. When he soon. It's this month, this month, you'll be able to start up against
[01:48:08.980 --> 01:48:15.780]   the end. We'll be opening back up. Yep. And the exquisite corpse and Mr Renee Richie of iMore.com
[01:48:15.780 --> 01:48:22.180]   and a little tip of that to crackberry.com for the use of the of the facilities facilities of the hall.
[01:48:22.180 --> 01:48:30.500]   Apparently squishy bird.com says F and done is even better. All right. All right. We do this. We do
[01:48:30.500 --> 01:48:36.900]   this score. We do this show every to every Tuesday 11 a.m. Oh, squishy bird. It's full screen.
[01:48:37.620 --> 01:48:39.620]   Oh, this is but watch out because if you don't.
[01:48:39.620 --> 01:48:52.020]   Oh, no. Oh, am I trying to get squished? You're you're the thing. You're the thing.
[01:48:52.020 --> 01:48:56.980]   Oh, they reversed it. They've they've turned the tables like angry pigs. Right.
[01:48:56.980 --> 01:49:03.140]   We do the show 11 a.m. Pacific every Tuesday. That's a 2 p.m. Eastern time.
[01:49:03.860 --> 01:49:09.540]   1900 UTC on Twitter TV. Please tune in live. That way you can feed us things like squishy bird.
[01:49:09.540 --> 01:49:14.100]   But if you can't make it here live, we always have on demand audio and video available after the
[01:49:14.100 --> 01:49:20.820]   fact of Twitter TV slash m be W or wherever you subscribe to finer net casts like iTunes. That
