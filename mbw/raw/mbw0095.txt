[00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.100]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, a time to talk about all things Mac
[00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.100]   and touch with a crew of Macintosh aficionados.
[00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.100]   Don't ask us to talk about Windows.
[00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.100]   We don't care.
[00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.100]   Starting with ladies first, Justine.
[00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.100]   I almost said ladies first, Merlin Mann.
[00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.100]   Ladies first, Justine Azeric of iJustine.com.
[00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.100]   Hi, Justine.
[00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.100]   Welcome.
[00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.100]   How are you?
[00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.100]   Welcome to the Bay Area.
[00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.100]   Yeah, I'm excited.
[00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.100]   You finally left Pittsburgh.
[00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.100]   Yeah, it's about time.
[00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.100]   Yeah.
[00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.100]   [ Laughter ]
[00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.100]   Oh, Alex Lindsay, Elle Pittsburghian.
[00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.100]   What do you say?
[00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.100]   Are you down there, you know?
[00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.100]   Are you Pittsburgh?
[00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.100]   Are you Pittsburghundians?
[00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.100]   What are you?
[00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.100]   Pittsburghans?
[00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.100]   Pittsburghers?
[00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.100]   Yeah.
[00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.100]   We're Yins guys.
[00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.100]   Yins?
[00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.100]   Yeah, Yins.
[00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.100]   It's like y'all, but it doesn't sound as nice as not as warm.
[00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.100]   Yins?
[00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.100]   So used in a sentence.
[00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.100]   It's, "Hey, Yins guys, go down there."
[00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.100]   Y'know, so down there, it's all mario, permanis, y'know.
[00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.100]   And I was like, "Hey Mario!"
[00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.100]   That's pretty much how it sounds.
[00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.100]   I love the mid-Atlantic accent.
[00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.100]   It's just weird.
[00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.100]   It's like, what?
[00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.100]   It doesn't, it has no, you can't say, "Oh yeah, it's kind of a New Jersey."
[00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.100]   And they took a left turn.
[00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.100]   It's not.
[00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.100]   It's nothing like...
[00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.100]   It's Maryland/Pennsylvania.
[00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.100]   It's just weird.
[00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.100]   A lot of people who haven't gone anywhere for a long time and they've developed their own little accent.
[00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.100]   And it's the same in Boston or New York.
[00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:10.100]   It just, y'know, it has its own little...
[00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.100]   Yeah, but why does Baltimore sound just like Pittsburgh?
[00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.100]   Why is that?
[00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.100]   I don't know.
[00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.100]   I don't know.
[00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.100]   That's a rat hole.
[00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.100]   A rat hole we don't want to sink into.
[00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.100]   Merlin Mann is back from his world tour speaking engagements.
[00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.100]   He's made his...
[00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.100]   Guys, I missed you guys.
[00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.100]   It's nice to be back.
[00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.100]   We missed you.
[00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.100]   Missed you very much.
[00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.100]   I have an Ohio accent.
[00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.100]   I have, I think...
[00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.100]   But you're from Florida.
[00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.100]   Well, kind of from Florida.
[00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.100]   I mean, really, I mean, when I learned how to talk theoretically, I was in Ohio and I think
[00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.100]   that sticks.
[00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.100]   And I still say things.
[00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.100]   People still have to say, "Well, I say like, "Worshington."
[00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.100]   Or "Cage."
[00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.100]   I say "Cage."
[00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.100]   And that's really annoying.
[00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.100]   My mom does that.
[00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.100]   When you say sticks, you don't mean STY acts.
[00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.100]   You mean it's stuck.
[00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.100]   See, this is what makes me think that I have an aphasia because I'm constantly pronouncing
[00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.100]   everything wrong.
[00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.100]   Everybody's always correcting me.
[00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.100]   People that I get into this thing where I really flick I'm losing my mind.
[00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:03.100]   Because if you take like, D-O-N as in Don Knots, and D-A-W-N as in Tony Orlando and Don,
[00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.100]   those literally sound identical.
[00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.100]   Don and Don.
[00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.100]   Don.
[00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.100]   Don.
[00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.100]   Don.
[00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.100]   So anyway, I should probably get some help.
[00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.100]   This is actually a real nice mishmosh, a papa ria of accents, because also from Baston,
[00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.100]   Andy Inatko is here from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.100]   I have no idea what you're talking about.
[00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.100]   Yeah, it has no accent.
[00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.100]   My favorite accent is the Chicago accent.
[00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.100]   How come, you know, you write for the Chicago Sun Times, you should say Chicago.
[00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.100]   Well, I mean, I live in Boston.
[00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.100]   I try to keep at least a thousand miles per myself and my editors at all times.
[00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.100]   It just keeps the relationship that much sweeter.
[00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.100]   But, no, I mean, my mother's from Boston.
[00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.100]   She packs a cat and have it yad.
[00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.100]   My father is from Pennsylvania.
[00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.100]   He parks the car in Harvard Yard.
[00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:51.500]   And my theory is that the two are sort of canceled each other out, leaving myself with sort of
[00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:59.900]   a Canadian, Ohio, Washington state, you know, sort of sort of Patois.
[00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.100]   This week in accents, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.100]   I've been approached to be the talking clock for Verizon.
[00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.020]   Have you really?
[00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.020]   It is 12.07 p.m.
[00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:10.820]   Is it because you're so regular?
[00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:16.340]   The weather is north-melt-froul, or something from the north-northwest.
[00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.580]   When it's disgusting, the parameter is falling, but not too siptously.
[00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:21.580]   So don't get served.
[00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.380]   But just take a little jacket tomorrow.
[00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:24.540]   You could really do that.
[00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:25.540]   You really could.
[00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:26.540]   Sounds good.
[00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:27.540]   Yeah.
[00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:28.540]   I guess you got that style.
[00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:29.540]   I read it.
[00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:30.540]   I'm left.
[00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:31.540]   You have a dream.
[00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:32.540]   You pursue the dream.
[00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:33.540]   You achieve the dream.
[00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.620]   I'm at step two right now.
[00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.700]   You had a dream and now it's pursuing you.
[00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.980]   I lived my dream on Monday.
[00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.980]   I was in Newark visiting with the folks at Audible.
[00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:44.980]   Love you all.
[00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:50.580]   In fact, I think I sent everybody Audible accounts for their one-year anniversary of
[00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.860]   our show that they've been advertising with the show.
[00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.420]   And I read an Audible book while I was there.
[00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.100]   So that was fun.
[00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.420]   I did a children's fairy tale, which we're going to give away, I guess.
[00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:06.220]   So that was actually living a little bit of a dream.
[00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.300]   So you're doing the voice horror for that?
[00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:09.980]   I mean, you're reading, doing the reading.
[00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:10.980]   How is that process?
[00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:11.980]   Sorry, I showed you that.
[00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:13.260]   It's exactly what you think it is.
[00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:14.780]   You sit in a voice booth.
[00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.780]   You have a producer on the other side of the glass.
[00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.820]   Actually, in this case, the engineer was doubling as a producer.
[00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.340]   But commonly, you have an engineer and a producer.
[00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.580]   And as you read, if you do something wrong or whatever, the producer says, "Can you do
[00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:26.580]   that again?"
[00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.060]   And you just do it again.
[00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.060]   So it's something the engineer did.
[00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.980]   Do you do as long as you can?
[00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:32.980]   Right.
[00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:33.980]   Okay.
[00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:37.900]   You keep going until you screw up, which in my case wasn't very long.
[00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.100]   And then they say, "Can you do that again?"
[00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:40.100]   And you do it again.
[00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.100]   In some cases, you do it a few times.
[00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.580]   I decided to do two straight throughs as they could take the best from it.
[00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.380]   But it was really fun.
[00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:50.620]   But they say it's about two hours for every hour of book.
[00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.860]   Takes twice as long to read it.
[00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.700]   Somebody who's a cop who's been doing it, who knows what they're doing.
[00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.020]   It's fun, though.
[00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.060]   It's really an interesting process.
[00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:03.180]   I just mentioned in passing that I already have to go to the bathroom.
[00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:04.700]   We went on for 20 minutes.
[00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:05.700]   Banana.
[00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:06.700]   Go ahead.
[00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:07.700]   You may go.
[00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:08.700]   I'll be fine.
[00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:09.700]   I'm fine.
[00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:10.700]   I got that taken care of.
[00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:11.700]   Don't worry.
[00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:12.700]   That's very good.
[00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:13.700]   We bought you by astronaut drivers.
[00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:14.700]   NASA has that secret.
[00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:15.700]   Why don't you have that secret?
[00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.700]   Because y'all be in the audience.
[00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:20.700]   And because it's auto trapping, it'll just be our little secret.
[00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:21.700]   Yay.
[00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:22.700]   Yay.
[00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:27.540]   Let's talk about some Mac news.
[00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:32.060]   You know, we're in that limbo, that interregnum between the announcement of iPhone 2 and the
[00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:34.940]   release of iPhone 2 in July 11th.
[00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:38.860]   And of course, in that intervening time, people have found lots of reasons to complain.
[00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:41.740]   We talked a little bit about it last week, the actual cost.
[00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:43.020]   Although this is nothing new.
[00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:45.260]   This is what a phone costs.
[00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:46.420]   Although AT&T was clever.
[00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:50.660]   They made it actually cost a little bit more, even though it's upfront cost is lower.
[00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:54.460]   I thought that was a nice manipulation, I thought.
[00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:55.460]   Well done.
[00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:58.340]   I think even if it's a perfect phone, we're still going to complain about it anyway.
[00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:01.020]   So I don't think we're ever really going to win.
[00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:03.100]   Has anybody looked at or played with the instinct?
[00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:05.980]   Because there are now, because now we're starting to finally, it took a year, but we're finally
[00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:09.420]   starting to see credible competitors for the iPhone.
[00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:10.540]   And the instinct is pretty close.
[00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:14.740]   You scroll with your finger, you know, it has visual voicemail.
[00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:16.260]   It does some things better than the iPhone.
[00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:23.180]   It has turn by turn GPS, which so far the iPhone 2, they say won't have.
[00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:24.500]   But at the same time, it's a little narrower.
[00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:27.060]   It doesn't have the beautiful elegant operating system.
[00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:28.060]   Yeah.
[00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:34.140]   One of the big problems with it, I found, is just that it doesn't get the touch quite
[00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:35.140]   right.
[00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:36.460]   It's there and it works.
[00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:41.540]   But whereas the iPhone almost seems to predict where you want it to go, the Samsung, there's
[00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:45.180]   always just that fraction of a second where it's trying to catch up with you.
[00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:47.420]   And that sort of cheeses the experience.
[00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:53.500]   It's so much of it is it could be as good as the iPhone if they put an extra six weeks
[00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:57.500]   just going through the OS and just metaphorically just looking for nail heads and need to be
[00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:58.500]   hammered down.
[00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:00.900]   Little places where the pain isn't quite right.
[00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:02.820]   Do you think they get that?
[00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:05.740]   Do you think they know that's what's wrong?
[00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:06.740]   I don't think so.
[00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:11.660]   Well, the question is, it's not does Samsung know that that's wrong?
[00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:14.500]   It's do the users really care?
[00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:17.580]   There's anybody who uses an iPhone will know immediately.
[00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:22.580]   Well, again, I mean, there are functions that we enjoy that we can really, really appreciate.
[00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:25.380]   But there are some people who just want a phone that works and just want a certain
[00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:27.380]   box full of features.
[00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:31.500]   I have friends who are real car nuts who will tell me about the clunk of a car door and
[00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:34.860]   how they have this new high performance chip put in.
[00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:39.620]   And I'm the guy who has cars with 75,000 miles on it that the key goes there, the gas
[00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:43.020]   goes there, the vector of motion is that way towards the hood.
[00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:44.020]   That's all I care about.
[00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:45.020]   Yeah.
[00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:46.020]   I think you're right.
[00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:49.420]   I think that we perhaps, you know, this you're talking to the enthusiast group right
[00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:50.420]   here.
[00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:51.980]   We know, we know we would feel the difference.
[00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:52.980]   We would notice the difference.
[00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:57.120]   But I think overall, I think when you're looking at whether it's the phone or the software,
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:00.820]   one of the things that I know when we're doing software development now, we're really digging
[00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:06.440]   into this idea that the future is not more features or more power or more speed generally.
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:11.180]   What the future is is making sure that whatever you're making software, phones, whatever,
[00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:13.540]   is really, really easy to use.
[00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:16.540]   And that's obviously something that Apple's been ahead of and it's something that was
[00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:21.420]   eye opening when we would talk to some of the folks there, we'd get how clear how clear
[00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:24.020]   their vision was in that area.
[00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:29.900]   And so I think that that's the thing that, you know, that these sprint or Samsung, I mean,
[00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:32.460]   this is a huge stretch from what they've had fast.
[00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:37.220]   So I think they're happy they just got there, but they're still, you know, pretty far behind.
[00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:41.060]   Is there any credible iPhone competitor?
[00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:44.560]   Not really because I don't think there's really any phone that's in its class.
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:48.300]   Every other touch based phone is in the business of trying to be a phone.
[00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:53.100]   Whereas I think the iPhone is trying to be a totally new platform for computing.
[00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:57.420]   I don't think there's any competitor that has quite that kind of ambition.
[00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:01.180]   I'm not a big fan of the plastic either because I actually did get to play with it for a while.
[00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:02.180]   Oh, yeah.
[00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:03.180]   You've touched the new iPhone.
[00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:04.180]   Yeah.
[00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:09.140]   It feels a little bit lighter, but the plastic just kind of loses that little Apple touch
[00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:10.140]   that.
[00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:11.980]   So I don't know.
[00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:14.380]   I mean, I'm going to get it, of course.
[00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:16.700]   That's really, that's really all the magic.
[00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:20.740]   It could be made out of human skin and we'd still be buying it.
[00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:21.740]   Yeah.
[00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:23.900]   Now some of us seem more anxious to actually.
[00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:25.780]   Nobody that I know, that's fine.
[00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:30.620]   I had an iPhone and a fine Kianti.
[00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:33.100]   So what else did you notice about it, Justin?
[00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:35.900]   Any other differences lighter, cheaper feeling?
[00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:37.500]   It felt a little bit lighter.
[00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:40.420]   And I mean, but it looks identical to the other one.
[00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:41.900]   Everyone's like, what's it look like?
[00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:46.580]   Like, we'll see in the other iPhone because it's pretty much exactly the same.
[00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:49.900]   And, you know, I mean, if you have an iPhone, you'll be able to upgrade to many of those
[00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:50.900]   features anyway.
[00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:55.220]   Somebody, somebody, I'm at lunch, I'm at lunch at that fine cafe.
[00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:58.620]   We went to the other day, the car de la fatoria.
[00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:01.100]   And guy pulls me over, says, just got one question.
[00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:02.100]   A2DP.
[00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:05.900]   And I said, no, he said, damn.
[00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:09.380]   It's funny how there are some people who are just aware of these things.
[00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:10.380]   Right.
[00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:13.700]   That's the stereo Bluetooth headset that you would think for crying out loud, the things
[00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:16.500]   in iPod that it would support and it still doesn't.
[00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:17.500]   Right.
[00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:18.500]   Oddly enough.
[00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:21.780]   But that's, they could fix that, I guess.
[00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:26.620]   I think all that marketing around radio waves, I kind of like having regular headphones with
[00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:29.140]   wires going into my phone and my phone being away from my head.
[00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:31.060]   Yeah, at least you can use regular headphones.
[00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:32.060]   Yeah.
[00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:33.060]   Yeah.
[00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:36.580]   So Greenpeace has made a list of the green companies.
[00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:38.020]   Once again, Greenpeace hates Apple.
[00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:39.780]   Let's face it, they just hate Apple.
[00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:40.780]   I don't know why.
[00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:41.780]   Okay, we hate Greenpeace.
[00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:42.780]   Yeah, screw it.
[00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:43.780]   That's the nature.
[00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:45.460]   They should get in their boats to go sail some whales.
[00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:52.300]   I don't, they, so the number one greenest company, Sony Ericsson, leading with almost
[00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:55.780]   top marks on toxic chemical phase out, but bad on recycling.
[00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:57.300]   I think they just make this crap up.
[00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:02.980]   Sony, then Nokia, then Samsung, then Dell, Toshiba, Acer, Panasonic, Motorola HP, finally
[00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:07.860]   number 10 spot Apple right in the middle between bad and better.
[00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:14.820]   The bottom Nintendo, Microsoft LG Fujitsu, Apple, they say increasing number of products
[00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:21.420]   free of the worst toxic chemicals, low scores on energy except for good energy efficiency
[00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:22.420]   and products.
[00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:24.980]   So I guess they mean low scores and energy in making them.
[00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:26.660]   I don't know what there's.
[00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:30.940]   Yeah, I, I, you know, just trying to put public pressure on all these guys.
[00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:31.940]   So they say maybe.
[00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:32.940]   Yeah.
[00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:33.940]   Well, they're 11.
[00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:34.940]   I'm sorry.
[00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:35.940]   11.
[00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:36.940]   11.
[00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:44.740]   They have, they have eliminated brominated flame retardants and PVC pyativinal plastic.
[00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:48.580]   I thought Apple was making a big deal about how green they are or is this just a, just
[00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:49.820]   a public city stunt?
[00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:54.500]   Yeah, there's a, there's a way that you get, you get placement for press release inside
[00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:56.060]   a newspaper TV show.
[00:12:56.060 --> 00:13:00.420]   You don't get it by saying that, that symbion is, is the green is, is the worst company.
[00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:04.300]   You get it by saying that the most popular company that everybody knows about is, is
[00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:05.300]   doing a bad job.
[00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:06.300]   Right.
[00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:07.500]   I don't know that Apple can do better.
[00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:12.420]   I'm sure that they can, but I, they're, they're, they're, they're organizations where they
[00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:16.100]   just have that sort of implicit credibility with a release like this.
[00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:17.740]   I don't think that Greenpeace is one of them.
[00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:18.740]   Yeah.
[00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:23.100]   Speaking of kind of suspect press releases, I supply does this every time there's a new
[00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:24.100]   Apple product.
[00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:27.620]   I supply looks at the supply chain, looks at all the parts and then does an estimate on
[00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:28.780]   the costs.
[00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:29.900]   They say it costs Apple.
[00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:32.900]   And again, they're doing this based solely on what they think the parts would add up
[00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:33.900]   to.
[00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:40.140]   It costs Apple about $173 to make an iPhone, which means I guess even at $190 bucks, they're
[00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:42.180]   making some money.
[00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:43.180]   How much does it include?
[00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:44.780]   That doesn't include what they make off of AT&T.
[00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:46.460]   They don't make anything off AT&T anymore.
[00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:47.460]   They chain apparently.
[00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:50.900]   Although I have to say, and Scott pointed this out, by the way, Scott's not with us.
[00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:52.820]   He couldn't be here today, but he'll be back next week.
[00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:57.740]   Scott pointed this out last week that every, all the blogs, all the news sources are speculating
[00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:00.980]   on what AT&T's contract will be and so forth.
[00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:03.860]   But as the facts come out, it's very different.
[00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:09.320]   For instance, I saw a story that said AT&T will include minutes, SMS minutes with their
[00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:11.300]   plan and they will have a $20 plan.
[00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:13.860]   So I just, I think we just don't know.
[00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:18.460]   And Gadget says now that it's going to be not 6 p.m. but 8 a.m. when they start selling
[00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:19.460]   the phone.
[00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:21.220]   I don't think anybody knows seriously.
[00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:23.020]   They're just making this crap up.
[00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:24.020]   Every website says something different.
[00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:26.820]   I'm going to just write an entry and just make up everything.
[00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:27.820]   They are.
[00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:28.820]   Yellow submarine.
[00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:29.820]   It's not too late.
[00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:30.820]   Merlin, yellow submarine.
[00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:34.220]   I think that's what a lot of people don't understand is I don't think I said specifically
[00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:35.700]   it was going to be on a date certain.
[00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:36.700]   You didn't say when.
[00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:39.140]   I said it would.
[00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:40.140]   I record stay.
[00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:42.740]   When are the Beatles going to for crying out loud?
[00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:46.620]   They said Paul McCartney said we will have Beatles albums on iTunes.
[00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:49.940]   He didn't say it quite like that.
[00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:51.660]   That was a little rougher.
[00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:52.660]   That was a little rougher.
[00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:53.660]   That was roughly.
[00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:55.860]   I got to tell you, that was a little rough.
[00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:56.860]   Surfall.
[00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:57.860]   Wow.
[00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:01.780]   You didn't say it quite like that, but I was looking at his eyes and I could see that's
[00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:02.780]   what he was thinking.
[00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:03.780]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:08.020]   I just think I think they're just trying to come up with a non socially awkward way to
[00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:11.620]   break a to Ringo that he's really not wanted at the real live presentation.
[00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:12.620]   Please.
[00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:13.620]   Can I come?
[00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:14.620]   I think there's a lot of.
[00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:15.620]   I think there's a lot of.
[00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:16.620]   I'll rub yellow submarine.
[00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:18.100]   We'll fix your to go plate Ringo.
[00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:22.100]   It's just that you know, it's not you know, I'm your friend.
[00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:23.100]   I want you there.
[00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:24.100]   It's Steve.
[00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:25.100]   You know, it's just Steve.
[00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:27.540]   You know, please, please, Paul.
[00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:29.980]   You never let me come anywhere.
[00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:33.980]   I love there was a there's a moment in the family guy.
[00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:38.100]   I can't remember what the context was, but it's like, this is how they treated Ringo
[00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:42.260]   whenever he brought in a song and they had the Beatles playing and Ringo's look over
[00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:45.340]   up to song and John says, Oh, that's great Ringo.
[00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:46.540]   Look what I'm going to do.
[00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:51.820]   I'm going to put it right on the refrigerator so we can see it every time we look at it.
[00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:53.740]   And it's oh boy.
[00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:54.740]   Thank you.
[00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:55.740]   That's tough.
[00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:59.340]   Kind of unfairness though, Ringo, first of all, is one of the best drummers in rock and roll.
[00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:02.100]   Is he really he wasn't just a just a journeyman?
[00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:06.380]   Oh, no, he's completely understated and he knows exactly what to leave out.
[00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:07.380]   He's exquisite.
[00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:09.900]   But second, you know, that's tough competition.
[00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:12.820]   Like two of the greatest songwriters of the last like 200 years.
[00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:13.820]   I mean, that's tough.
[00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:14.820]   It is tough.
[00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:16.020]   No, you're well, not that not to step it.
[00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:21.900]   They were only he was only he and Harrison were only given one song per album because you
[00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:23.540]   know, it wasn't just their talent.
[00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:25.700]   It was just the idea that, you know, we're going to be making.
[00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:28.300]   A hundred million dollars off this song.
[00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:29.740]   We like to keep that money for ourselves.
[00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:30.740]   We like the money.
[00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:32.060]   Good money, money, good.
[00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:36.820]   Well, and then I mean, look at Sir Paul kind of moves the order of names after, you know,
[00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:38.060]   John passes away.
[00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:39.980]   I thought that was a little tacky.
[00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:41.900]   He's getting more of the money though, that way.
[00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:44.340]   Anyway, where are the Beatles songs?
[00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:45.340]   Where are they?
[00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:47.540]   They were supposed to be this year, right?
[00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:48.540]   That's what we heard.
[00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:51.300]   Well, well, how do we know they were supposed to be this year?
[00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:53.060]   That's what Paul said.
[00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:54.060]   Sure.
[00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:55.060]   Well, okay.
[00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:58.660]   Oh, if you're going to go for if you're going to go with that kind of information, that
[00:16:58.660 --> 00:16:59.660]   kind of source.
[00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:03.100]   If we're going to be if we're going to Wikipedia this, you know, we're going to go with sources
[00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:04.100]   like that.
[00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:06.220]   All right, let's face it.
[00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:08.180]   We know nothing.
[00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:12.380]   So according to I supply getting back to the cost of the iPhone, the most expensive component
[00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:14.220]   is the memory.
[00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:18.980]   I'm surprised to hear that the flat eight gigs of flash is $22.80 touch screen, which
[00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:20.860]   I would have thought would be the most expensive.
[00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:24.140]   I supply estimates is 20 bucks.
[00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:28.100]   All the other chips and components add up to $164.
[00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:31.220]   Apple's paying nine bucks for the assembly of the device.
[00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:36.500]   It was small Chinese family doing that and then a total of 173 bucks for the whole thing.
[00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:42.660]   They're making it on high again in China.
[00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:46.340]   But I figure, you know, I figure ATT is underwriting the phone, right?
[00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:49.220]   So they may be paying Apple 300 bucks.
[00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:53.060]   You got to figure they're paying them more because Apple's lost this monthly, supposedly
[00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:56.380]   lost this monthly fee they're going to get or we're getting from AT&T.
[00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:59.700]   So they must make more upfront.
[00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:02.100]   I think that I'm sure that they're making some more money.
[00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:07.340]   I think that Apple's, my guess is that their primary focus is on making sure that it becomes
[00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:08.980]   a standard, you know, like the iPod.
[00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:13.700]   You get people who like me who, you know, if they can't figure out how a certain music
[00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:18.420]   service is going to fit easily into the iPod, they just don't do it.
[00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:20.100]   And I think that that's where they need to get that.
[00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:25.940]   And by the way, I have Twitter this a couple times that Merlin was, I hate saying this.
[00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:27.420]   Just really hate saying this.
[00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:29.340]   Merlin's not here now.
[00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:31.060]   He's right.
[00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:32.060]   He was right.
[00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:33.060]   Yeah.
[00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:34.060]   Yeah.
[00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:36.860]   I'm buying a lot of stuff from Amazon.com now.
[00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:37.860]   Oh, really?
[00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:39.780]   It's not that painful, huh?
[00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:40.780]   It got easy.
[00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:41.980]   It got easier after I got used to it.
[00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:42.980]   Oh, music.
[00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:43.980]   Yeah.
[00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:44.980]   Yeah.
[00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:46.420]   It's 256 bit and it's not.
[00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:47.420]   There's no.
[00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:48.420]   Here's what happened is like, it wasn't just Merlin.
[00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:50.700]   Hey, dude, I said it too.
[00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:51.900]   Can I get a little credit here?
[00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:53.340]   Oh, did you, did you say that to?
[00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:54.340]   Okay.
[00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:55.340]   Leo, you were right too.
[00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:56.340]   Okay.
[00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:57.340]   I said it.
[00:18:57.340 --> 00:19:00.020]   I said, here's the thing is I got a thing where I had five computers that were linked
[00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:03.620]   in and I couldn't use some of my songs and I was like, okay, I'm not doing this anymore.
[00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:05.140]   I just like all the time.
[00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:06.580]   I was like, okay, this is, this is crazy.
[00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:12.180]   And so, so now I always check first on Amazon before I buy the stuff from iTunes.
[00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:14.780]   So, and it's just the DRM's got to go.
[00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:15.780]   It does sound.
[00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:19.220]   I mean, I have really dead ears, but it sounds a lot better to me too.
[00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:20.220]   Well, then remixes, especially.
[00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:27.500]   I just bought Genesis, Duke, Trick of the Tale and Abacab and they're all like these remastered
[00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:30.180]   ones and they just sound, they sound great.
[00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:31.180]   Yeah.
[00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:32.180]   Really, really good.
[00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:34.260]   Better than I heard them in a long time.
[00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:36.060]   So it was really good.
[00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:41.540]   I bought a lot of iTunes stuff and I continue to and I, you know, I love iTunes, but it's,
[00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:46.460]   I got to admit, I'm not even like that guy about the whole like DRM thing, but it, I
[00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:48.580]   run into real world problems.
[00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:52.940]   And I, you know, I don't think I'm atypical for somebody who consumes media today, but
[00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:53.940]   I don't know.
[00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:57.620]   It's just hard for me to believe that DRM is going to be around for too, too long.
[00:19:57.620 --> 00:20:01.020]   I just, and I just, I feel like these, the companies, of course, the music companies
[00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:05.220]   are trying to hold Apple back by not giving them the DRM, okay, you know, for iTunes and
[00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:06.220]   and that's frustrating.
[00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:13.300]   I mean, I know it's not Apple would love to pull all that DRM off tomorrow, but until
[00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:17.100]   they do, I'm getting much more comfortable with the Amazon experience.
[00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:18.860]   I'm gonna have to stick with it.
[00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:19.860]   Yeah.
[00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:20.860]   That's great.
[00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:21.860]   I think on Amazon, I'm surprised.
[00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:22.860]   I don't.
[00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:26.940]   I mean, I'll randomly buy some DVDs, but other than music, I mean, I pretty much stick
[00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:27.940]   to iTunes.
[00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:29.020]   So yeah, you should try it.
[00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:32.300]   It's really, I mean, I think it's a really remarkable store.
[00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:34.460]   And so now I'm glad to hear you Alex, you're liking it.
[00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:37.780]   It seems like you of all people would have gotten on to that bandwagon right away.
[00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:41.020]   Yeah, I was just like, oh, you know, usually when I want to, a lot of times when I buy
[00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:43.940]   songs, it's just like they pop into my head and it's really easy to be sitting in front
[00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:46.660]   of iTunes and I just go click, click, click, click, and I buy it, you know, and I still
[00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:48.060]   do a fair bit of that.
[00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:52.500]   You know, I just, in my head, I'm sitting in front of iTunes and I buy probably five or
[00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:54.500]   ten songs a month that way.
[00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:55.500]   What are you saying?
[00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:56.500]   I'm sorry.
[00:20:56.500 --> 00:21:00.940]   I'm just gonna say that also Amazon, how am I gonna put this?
[00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:04.020]   iTunes is great because you got in the habit of thinking about, okay, I go to iTunes to
[00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:07.340]   buy music and then increasingly go there to buy movies or whatever.
[00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:10.020]   But Amazon, it's weird.
[00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:12.940]   It's kind of become like the Wikipedia retail for me.
[00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:16.420]   We're like, it's kind of the first place I go, partly because I will say honestly, I'm
[00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:17.900]   an Amazon Prime guy.
[00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:20.300]   So I look for a place where I get free shipping.
[00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:21.860]   So that's where I start.
[00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:23.660]   I want to like identify a pattern though.
[00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:27.340]   And that pattern for me is I tend to start looking for stuff that I'm thinking about
[00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:31.660]   buying, you know, at Amazon.
[00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:36.260]   Even before I go somewhere like one of those price comparison sites, I'll frequently go
[00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:37.260]   to Amazon.
[00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:41.420]   So anyway, I just think that, yeah, I could be searching for something, find a book that
[00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:44.900]   I like and then suddenly I go, oh, you know, actually, you know, this makes me think of
[00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:46.820]   this, you know, record or whatever.
[00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:52.460]   And then I can jump over to the hit click on the MP3 downloads link and I'm done, you
[00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:53.460]   know?
[00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:55.460]   Yeah, as Amazon Prime is heroin.
[00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:57.420]   I mean, you know, it's just like--
[00:21:57.420 --> 00:21:58.420]   It's really a marketing.
[00:21:58.420 --> 00:21:59.420]   Brilliant marketing.
[00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:04.020]   We pay them 75 bucks to guarantee that we'll be using Amazon for the rest of the year.
[00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:05.020]   Yeah.
[00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:06.020]   Yeah.
[00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:07.020]   And mine is not even free shipping.
[00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:10.660]   It's that I can get it overnight in for $3, which I get microwapes.
[00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:11.740]   I've had a microwave sand.
[00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:12.740]   I've had shelving sand.
[00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:13.740]   I mean, there's no way.
[00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:16.100]   I don't even know how they make any money on that because I get the whole--
[00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:17.100]   Well, they make money.
[00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:18.100]   Oh, it all works.
[00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:19.100]   Oh, sure they do.
[00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:22.300]   I'm sure they make money on everybody else, but I order really big items for $3 and they
[00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:23.540]   show up the next day, you know?
[00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:24.540]   That's incredible.
[00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:27.420]   It's incredible for $3.
[00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:32.820]   So somebody said in the stick am chat room that the iPhone 2.0 goes gold on Friday.
[00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:35.220]   I'm not sure where they heard that rumor.
[00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:38.300]   But that would be about right if they're going to make it by July 11th.
[00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:41.740]   That gives them only two weeks to get the thing out the door.
[00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:46.260]   They got to start making them, you know, actually putting the firmware on there.
[00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:49.780]   I'm surprised that in fact, if it weren't done earlier.
[00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:50.780]   Yeah.
[00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:55.300]   Yeah, it's going to be-- you know, all of us will be on the kind of the bleeding edge
[00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:56.900]   where we're bleeding a little bit more than we're cutting.
[00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:58.340]   I'm not-- I think I'm not going to get one.
[00:22:58.340 --> 00:22:59.340]   I'm going to watch.
[00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:00.340]   I'm going to watch you guys bleed.
[00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:02.860]   I'm going to wave all the-- it's kind of interesting.
[00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:07.580]   If there is a component of in-store activation, that's also an opportunity for a last minute
[00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:09.580]   firmware patch for everyone.
[00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:10.580]   Yeah.
[00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:11.580]   That comes out.
[00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:12.580]   That could be part of the deal.
[00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:16.380]   Yeah, I'm kind of upset because I'll be on vacation and the nearest Apple store is five
[00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:17.380]   hours away.
[00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:20.180]   So I'm going to be on North Carolina.
[00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:23.300]   So I'm going to be like, you know, mom, I'm going to take the family mini van.
[00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:24.820]   I'm going to go for a little road trip.
[00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:26.780]   I'll be back later.
[00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:31.260]   Now, when she said the nearest Apple store is five hours away, how many of us were thinking
[00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:33.100]   Central America?
[00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:37.020]   Because we're so used to having multiple Apple stores within, like, drive--
[00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:40.820]   I can't imagine that North Carolina is not the end of the universe.
[00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:41.820]   I don't understand.
[00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:42.820]   Well, but you've got to understand.
[00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:44.300]   She's talking about Cape Hatteras, right?
[00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:45.780]   Yeah, well, we're going to the Outer Banks.
[00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:47.300]   So I'm going to go into the beach.
[00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:48.300]   So, you know.
[00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:49.300]   Yeah.
[00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:52.940]   And so we go to Raleigh, where will you go to-- what's that?
[00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:53.940]   Where's the Apple store, Raleigh?
[00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:54.940]   I don't know why.
[00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:55.940]   I don't know why there's--
[00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:56.940]   It's got to be what at Raleigh, Durham.
[00:23:56.940 --> 00:24:03.340]   I think there's one-- I think my guess is in Newport or not in Norfolk.
[00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:05.140]   Yeah, there's three in North Carolina.
[00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:06.860]   You just wanted to say Norfolk.
[00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:10.780]   No, I'm-- let's say Pittsburghians go to Hatteras all the time.
[00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:13.020]   That's like the place for-- if you're in Pittsburgh area--
[00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:14.020]   Ohio, everywhere.
[00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:15.980]   Like there's little OSX stickers everywhere.
[00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:17.260]   I mean, no, OSX, OBX.
[00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:18.260]   OBX, yeah.
[00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:19.780]   OBX stickers everywhere in Pittsburgh.
[00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:21.620]   So we all know everything about Hatteras.
[00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:24.980]   So, as Del Hokey says, go to the Norfolk MacArthur mall.
[00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:26.380]   They have an Apple store there, right there.
[00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:27.380]   There you go.
[00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:28.380]   Yeah.
[00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:29.380]   That's the place to go.
[00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:30.380]   MacArthur Center mall in Norfolk.
[00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:31.380]   There you go.
[00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:32.380]   There you go.
[00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:33.380]   8 AM.
[00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:34.380]   You mean you're leaving at 3 AM?
[00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:35.380]   Is it 8 AM?
[00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:36.380]   So we know now it's 8 AM or--
[00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:38.340]   Shh, that's what they're saying on a gadget.
[00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:39.340]   Who knows what?
[00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:40.340]   That's the word.
[00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:41.340]   Who knows what?
[00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:43.500]   You could go to an AT&T store too, though, right?
[00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:47.060]   So the line starts at 11 or 5 o'clock in the afternoon than they before.
[00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:48.060]   Yeah, I'd have to.
[00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:49.060]   And that's going to be a real line.
[00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:51.060]   If you have to activate, that's going to be--
[00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:52.060]   Oh, that's going to be a nightmare.
[00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:53.060]   Really?
[00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:57.060]   So maybe it would be better go to an AT&T store because people are planning up at the end.
[00:24:57.060 --> 00:25:00.060]   Another thing you could do is wait a day or two.
[00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:01.060]   No.
[00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:02.060]   You guys are--
[00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:03.060]   You guys are what I'm doing, Merlin.
[00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:04.660]   You guys are really weird.
[00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:06.060]   Why do you need to sit in?
[00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:08.860]   But it's a part of the experience, isn't it?
[00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:09.860]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:12.780]   And if you're buying electronics, is that really--
[00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:20.260]   So we are going to be doing live coverage starting probably 5 AM because I got to cover
[00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:23.260]   the East Coast on Twit Live.
[00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:27.340]   And I guess we're going to talk to anybody who's in a line at the Apple Store or an AT&T
[00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:33.580]   and can get online with your Mac book, Call Me on Skype, and we'll call Twit Live as the
[00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:38.900]   Skype handle and we'll talk to people in line all over the world.
[00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:40.140]   I think that'd be fun.
[00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:42.140]   And I guess we're going to see some Pixelcore people and they're going to--
[00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:43.140]   What are you laughing at, Merlin?
[00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:44.140]   I'm just answering.
[00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:45.140]   But I'm laughing too.
[00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:46.140]   I'm just not laughing.
[00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:49.740]   I'm just saying, yes, Twit listeners, we're going to have live coverage of people standing
[00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:50.740]   in a line.
[00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:51.740]   It's going to be great.
[00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:55.420]   No, we see that way you get the experience of having it drive to Norfolk Mall.
[00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:59.580]   We've been inspired by Super Bowl coverage where they start 12 hours early just to start
[00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:02.380]   up-- just to make sure the people have their butts in the couch.
[00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:03.940]   Okay, okay, okay.
[00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:05.580]   And we're giving away iPhones every hour.
[00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:06.580]   How about that?
[00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:07.580]   Okay, that'll--
[00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:09.820]   Okay, now he's pulling out the big guess.
[00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:10.340]   Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:12.340]   the old iPhone or the new good one?
[00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:13.340]   The new--
[00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:15.020]   Well, what we're going to do-- I think Audible's going to do this.
[00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:17.540]   I got Audible to sponsor our coverage.
[00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:22.780]   So I think what's going to happen is we'll give away a certificate, a gift certificate
[00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:23.780]   for a new phone.
[00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:25.740]   So you'll stuff to go in because you have to activate it.
[00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:26.740]   Yeah, okay.
[00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:30.180]   And we'll probably give away some books to go on the new phone.
[00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:31.180]   See?
[00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:35.340]   Yeah, by the way, I've been teaching a bunch of my friends that bit.
[00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:36.340]   What bit?
[00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:39.780]   Oh, is that the old iPhone?
[00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:40.780]   [laughter]
[00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:42.780]   Yeah, so cool.
[00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:47.500]   It's coming into me telling you to get you see such angry Apple people and people.
[00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:48.500]   Yeah, you know what?
[00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:50.740]   Actually, no, it's the current iPhone.
[00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:52.020]   And when the new one comes out, I will get it.
[00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:54.940]   But I can't get it till it comes out.
[00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:56.820]   Oh, you got the old one still.
[00:26:56.820 --> 00:26:57.820]   That's great.
[00:26:57.820 --> 00:27:02.020]   No, you got to do it with the tone of voice and the head tilt.
[00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:03.860]   Oh, you got the old one.
[00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:04.860]   Oh, yeah.
[00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:08.660]   I remember using-- how's that working for you?
[00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:09.660]   It's cold.
[00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:11.660]   That edge network.
[00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:12.660]   Fastest.
[00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:13.660]   So cold.
[00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:17.060]   You get bad.
[00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:19.780]   Now, we should mention HSDPA is far from everywhere.
[00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:20.780]   It's not in Hatteras.
[00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:23.460]   I guarantee you that.
[00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:25.260]   You know, people should check their coverage maps.
[00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:28.860]   If you look at the coverage map, it's actually not very wide spread.
[00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:31.980]   AT&T is not exactly put it everywhere.
[00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:38.220]   AT&T, yeah, my coverage with them and service altogether hasn't been exactly.
[00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:39.220]   Yeah.
[00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:40.220]   And you'll get edge most places.
[00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:45.100]   I mean, you're not going to get HSDPA except in the big metros, I think.
[00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:47.340]   But if you look at the list, I'm not getting it up here in Petaloma.
[00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:48.340]   I can tell you that.
[00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:49.340]   You may not want to--
[00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:53.260]   Yeah, you may not want to be moving up here.
[00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:55.020]   I can handle it, I think.
[00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:56.020]   It's going to be--
[00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:57.020]   The key is you just need city Wi-Fi.
[00:27:57.020 --> 00:27:58.020]   You know, Petaloma is not that big.
[00:27:58.020 --> 00:27:59.020]   Wi-Fi.
[00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:00.020]   We do have city Wi-Fi, but it doesn't work very well.
[00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:01.020]   But we do have city Wi-Fi.
[00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:02.020]   That's what happens.
[00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:03.020]   At least you have it.
[00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:05.020]   Just like downtown area.
[00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:06.020]   Right.
[00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:08.020]   Delafetoria has Wi-Fi.
[00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:09.020]   That's all I can.
[00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:11.900]   So I'm on the AT&T coverage viewer page.
[00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:12.900]   So am I, actually?
[00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:17.380]   Look at HSDPA though, you got to go to the high speed.
[00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:19.220]   It's not their cell coverage map.
[00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:21.300]   There's a little thing that you can check.
[00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:22.300]   Yeah.
[00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:25.060]   They actually don't even do a map, they say, by city.
[00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:27.100]   OK, I see it.
[00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:28.100]   Wow.
[00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:29.100]   I see it.
[00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:30.100]   I see it in selected areas.
[00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:31.100]   It's in selected areas.
[00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:32.100]   I'll tell you, Leela Porte.
[00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:38.540]   I'll tell you, Leela Porte, that is a pretty short page given to the number of cities.
[00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:42.420]   Yeah, I don't know why people are making such a big deal about this 3G.
[00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:45.580]   Because most people will not get 3G service.
[00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:48.140]   But Justine, if you were still in Pennsylvania, you'd have it.
[00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:51.980]   You get Allentown, Harrisburg, Northeast Scran, Philadelphia Pittsburgh, Redding, and State
[00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:52.980]   College.
[00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:53.980]   Lots of clubs.
[00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:55.820]   Rhode Island, Rhode Island is just Providence.
[00:28:55.820 --> 00:28:57.580]   That's probably not too hard.
[00:28:57.580 --> 00:28:58.580]   Wow.
[00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:00.980]   Wisconsin has Madison and Milwaukee, and that's it.
[00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:02.340]   Yeah, there's a lot of areas.
[00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:03.340]   Look at Vermont.
[00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:04.340]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:05.340]   It's not on the list.
[00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:06.340]   Oh, yeah.
[00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:09.820]   You can't even get AT&T in Vermont.
[00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:15.020]   And even if you're trying to use an iPhone, you still have to say, "Hi, Hazel.
[00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:17.580]   I'd like Klondock 5, 11, 8."
[00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:18.580]   Which is OK.
[00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:19.580]   I dig that.
[00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:20.580]   Well, it's an upgrade.
[00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:22.860]   Because two years ago, you'd say, "Sparky, this is radar.
[00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:26.500]   Get back this through, huh?"
[00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:27.500]   I don't mind that.
[00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:28.500]   I like that.
[00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:29.500]   Then they listen in.
[00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:30.500]   It's fun.
[00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:32.700]   Look at Alaska, not much coverage in Alaska.
[00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:34.700]   I had to say, I'm kind of surprised.
[00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:38.660]   That seems pretty parsimonious given how heavily they're publicizing this.
[00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:40.660]   Well, they say they're rolling it out fast, right?
[00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:42.500]   That's because nobody's looking at the coverage.
[00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:43.940]   They're just like, "Oh, right.
[00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:44.940]   3G."
[00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:45.940]   Yeah.
[00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:46.940]   We should probably look at that.
[00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:47.940]   Yeah.
[00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:48.940]   That's a pretty big aspect.
[00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:49.940]   I have now.
[00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:51.340]   But it is an interesting cross-section.
[00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:53.860]   I was like, Bellingham, Washington.
[00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:54.860]   I've been there.
[00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:55.860]   It's not that big.
[00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:56.860]   I'm kind of surprised that it's covered about.
[00:29:56.860 --> 00:29:57.860]   Ah, yeah.
[00:29:57.860 --> 00:29:58.860]   But a lot of Microsoft is up there.
[00:29:58.860 --> 00:29:59.860]   They're probably trying to.
[00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:00.860]   Yeah.
[00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:01.860]   There we go.
[00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:02.860]   All right.
[00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:03.860]   Yeah.
[00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:08.460]   Basically, if you're living near any place that Walt Mossberg does, you're going to get
[00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:12.660]   deferred vacations or takes back his blockbuster videos or anything like that.
[00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:13.660]   You're great.
[00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:16.260]   It's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, sweetened coverage.
[00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:18.460]   Like, they're just following him on the transmitter.
[00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:21.260]   Like, anywhere near his morning commute, there you go.
[00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:25.260]   Anywhere along the guy, 95 connector in the northeast, you're good.
[00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:28.020]   Ah, let's see.
[00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:29.420]   What other stories are there?
[00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:31.540]   It's kind of a slow, kind of a slow week.
[00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:32.540]   Maybe not.
[00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:33.540]   I don't know.
[00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:34.540]   Oh, I've, what I almost forgot.
[00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:35.540]   Big story.
[00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:36.540]   Huge story.
[00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:39.100]   Well, a virus, Mac Trojan horse in the wild.
[00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:42.060]   This is, this is not a drill, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:44.660]   This is the real deal.
[00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:51.820]   This Trojan is taking advantage of a known flaw in Apple's Remote Access agent, the
[00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:54.260]   ARD agent.
[00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:56.260]   And you get that you have to get, it's a Trojan.
[00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:59.340]   So you have to somehow, they have to get you to run an application either emailing it to
[00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:03.980]   you, sending it to you via iChat, maybe making you go to a webpage where it downloads and
[00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:06.900]   then you open it, but you have to open that application.
[00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:12.940]   Once you do, it takes advantage of this hole in the ARD agent and all of a sudden a hacker
[00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:17.580]   can get into your system, get full remote access, take pictures with the iSight, put
[00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:21.940]   files on your system, download other files from your system, share your computer, all
[00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:22.940]   of that stuff.
[00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:23.940]   That's pretty rough.
[00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:28.540]   That whole taking pictures with the iSight thing, that always freaked out.
[00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:32.260]   Before I go to sleep at night, I close my MacBooks and like, "I don't really know."
[00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:35.300]   So if they take a picture, does a light have to go on?
[00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:39.300]   Would you have a signal that somehow you're, I think they would have to go on.
[00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:43.740]   Any time that the camera is, power goes to the camera, power also goes to the LEDs, that's
[00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:44.740]   impossible.
[00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:46.500]   As far as I know, that's impossible to defeat.
[00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:50.060]   But that's always what I thought was one of the greatest features of the iSight camera.
[00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:55.260]   There was a manual iris that you could manually reach over and there's a physical block over
[00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:56.260]   the lens.
[00:31:56.260 --> 00:31:57.500]   Yeah, that was a good thing.
[00:31:57.500 --> 00:31:58.500]   I missed that.
[00:31:58.500 --> 00:31:59.820]   Dude, you don't have that anymore.
[00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:03.460]   You could put a little piece of tape over it, I guess, black, electrician's tape.
[00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:06.740]   I like, I like scotch tape myself so that they can see that something's there, but it's
[00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:07.740]   all blurry.
[00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:11.700]   It's like the front of my shot.
[00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:13.580]   And then you dance around naked and tease them.
[00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:14.580]   Is that what you do?
[00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:15.580]   Yes.
[00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:16.580]   That's what I like to do.
[00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:17.980]   I frustrate to do that, Alex.
[00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:18.980]   It's very frustrating.
[00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:19.980]   Great, that, when he does that.
[00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:21.860]   There's a fix for this that was going around.
[00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:25.660]   It's a, you know, just a little modest fix, but you know, there's something you can run
[00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:26.660]   from the terminal.
[00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:27.660]   Yeah.
[00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:28.660]   Or you can do it yourself.
[00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:33.540]   Move the ARD agent out of your system folder, zip it up, put it somewhere else until Apple
[00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:36.780]   fixes this, but you will lose remote access.
[00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:40.580]   But if you're not using remote access and most people aren't, get rid of it.
[00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:41.580]   Right.
[00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:42.580]   Get rid of it.
[00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:47.740]   And the reason this is a story, there have been conceptual viruses, but this one's actually
[00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:48.740]   out there.
[00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:50.380]   It's it's a, it's a, it's a conclusion horse.
[00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:51.380]   It's not a virus.
[00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:52.380]   Yeah.
[00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:53.380]   Okay.
[00:32:53.380 --> 00:32:54.380]   No point.
[00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:55.380]   Is that a fair distinction?
[00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:57.900]   I mean, in this case, it's a very fair distinction because you have to get on your system and you
[00:32:57.900 --> 00:33:00.860]   somehow you have to activate it.
[00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:05.100]   So could you, could you do something like, could you put JavaScript in a page that would
[00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:06.980]   automatically execute this?
[00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:09.660]   I would require a flaw in the browser.
[00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:15.180]   So, and they remember, remember that Safari people dinged it because it would open automatically
[00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:17.260]   so-called safe file formats.
[00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:18.260]   Yeah.
[00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:23.300]   Uh, for instance, that was, you know, a secure, you know, kind of a minor security flaw would
[00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:26.180]   automatically open and install widgets early on.
[00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:27.420]   I think they've taken care of that.
[00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:30.300]   And I don't, I don't know if there were remote execution exploits.
[00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:34.740]   There was that one that the, the guy at the hack conference told everybody about, but
[00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:35.740]   that's been.
[00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:38.180]   I'm not trying to, I'm not necessarily trying to whistle past the graveyard, but I'm generally
[00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:41.300]   curious about how, how you'd get this Trojan.
[00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:45.220]   So like you think you're downloading something that's share where or something in you.
[00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:46.220]   So could be like.
[00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:47.780]   Or somebody sends it to you in a chat room.
[00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:50.900]   Um, but it just is like a shell script.
[00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:51.900]   I mean, what was it?
[00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:54.860]   It is an apple, it's apple script and some other stuff.
[00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:55.860]   Okay.
[00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:56.860]   It's a pretty big deal.
[00:33:56.860 --> 00:33:59.820]   I mean, once you get in, it's, you know, according to this, it's like once you get
[00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:01.180]   a blog or anything, it's not.
[00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:03.020]   So I mean, clearly they get root.
[00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:04.620]   I'm just curious about what it looks like.
[00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:08.660]   I mean, does it, does it look like one of those wacky things that gets attached to email
[00:34:08.660 --> 00:34:13.900]   messages or does it, you know, I have to say, now I'm, now I'm looking at a article security
[00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:14.900]   fix.
[00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:18.420]   This is Brian Krebs, excellent security column in the Washington post.
[00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:22.020]   And he says, even though secure Mac and intigos say they have spotted this in the wild,
[00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:25.820]   he says, I want to stress there's absolutely no evidence this Trojan is spreading in the
[00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:26.820]   wild.
[00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:29.700]   So, so that's important.
[00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:30.700]   That's an important distinction.
[00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:36.020]   Cause we've seen Trojan concept Trojans before, but the real question is, is it out there?
[00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:37.020]   Do you have to worry about it?
[00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:38.860]   And you're right, Merlin, you have to do something.
[00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:41.700]   Again, I just want to be super clear about what I'm trying to say here.
[00:34:41.700 --> 00:34:45.980]   I'm not, first of all, I think we all have a really, I think we have a false sense of
[00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:48.940]   security because we use a Mac and I think it's a false sense of security about stuff
[00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:51.220]   that we don't even realize it's that false about.
[00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:55.540]   I mean, you start realizing how powerful the underpinning Unix underlying Unix system
[00:34:55.540 --> 00:34:56.540]   is.
[00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:59.300]   I mean, if you haven't spent time in the terminal and know how you can destroy your life, you
[00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:01.900]   don't really know how sharp the knife you're holding is.
[00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:05.100]   So I mean, there's all kinds of ways there's ways you could send somebody stuff.
[00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:09.500]   You could have a webpage that's got a really popular post on it that has one line of terminal
[00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:11.780]   code that somebody copy and paste and changes their life.
[00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:14.180]   So there's all kinds of ways that you can mess stuff up.
[00:35:14.180 --> 00:35:18.060]   I just, I just want to clarify, you know, kind of kind of what this looks like for a
[00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:19.940]   normal person.
[00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:22.980]   And I'm sorry, there's a car honking outside.
[00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:24.980]   And don't worry about it.
[00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:25.980]   I enjoy it.
[00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:26.980]   It's musical.
[00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:27.980]   But yeah.
[00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:32.340]   And so, you know, I think that getting in the habit of thinking that this is not something
[00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:37.500]   that the quote unquote stupid windows users only get on, you know, is a smart.
[00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:38.500]   That's the key.
[00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:39.500]   That's the key.
[00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:43.860]   I think that, you know, whether this is really a problem or not, it's, it's a little warning
[00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:48.380]   signal that, you know, guys, we got to be aware and you can't, for instance, open email
[00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:49.780]   attachments just because you're using a Mac.
[00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:54.780]   You can't just say, Oh, good.
[00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:57.780]   Look, somebody sent me an accord of COVA pictures.
[00:35:57.780 --> 00:35:58.780]   What I think about.
[00:35:58.780 --> 00:35:59.780]   So I've got a, I've got a, I've got a random.
[00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:00.780]   Sorry, that was very dated, wasn't it?
[00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:01.780]   Should be somebody like that.
[00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:03.780]   Somebody recently, but I've had a kind of a lock.
[00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:07.060]   I had a little rant brewing about this and I'm trying to think about whether it's worth
[00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:12.740]   doing a post about, but I have this sense that the, the iPhone does so many great things.
[00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:15.820]   But one thing the iPhone, I think does poorly is password management.
[00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:19.340]   And so if you're using something like one password, you know, you're going to, you're
[00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:23.860]   going to hopefully mitigate some of the, you know, big problems that you can avoid by having
[00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:25.020]   secure passwords.
[00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:28.900]   My sense is in talking to people anecdotally, A, people are not locking their iPhones and
[00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:32.060]   B, people are really dumbing down their passwords.
[00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:35.580]   So what I tend to start thinking about is, okay, well, so if you've changed your dot
[00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:40.980]   Mac password or if you change the password on your AP, your, your, you know, your internet,
[00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:44.740]   your wireless to be really easy to type, I just wonder if that's a pattern you start
[00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:45.740]   reviewing other places.
[00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:47.740]   And I, and I don't know if that's the thing.
[00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:52.460]   Because if you, if you have back to my Mac turned on on the off chance that it does work
[00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:56.420]   one afternoon and you have a trivial password on your computer, your world's going to change
[00:36:56.420 --> 00:36:57.420]   really fast.
[00:36:57.420 --> 00:37:00.820]   I mean, they're handing you a bunch of extremely sharp knives on a Mac.
[00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:05.740]   And I think a lot of people have got such a, such a confidence that then nothing's ever
[00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:10.020]   going to happen to them that they have no idea what they're like a couple inches away from
[00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:11.220]   if something goes wrong.
[00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:12.740]   That's well, here's, here's an example.
[00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:15.780]   And this again from Brian Krebs at the, the Washington Post, he's the real, the real flaw
[00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:23.620]   is the Apple remote desktop agent ARDA will execute anything, any command from Apple script
[00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:28.020]   as root regardless of whether you are administrator, regardless, it won't ask you for administrator
[00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:29.020]   password.
[00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:30.340]   It just, this is a real flaw.
[00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:31.540]   So that's how this works.
[00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:35.340]   It sends a shells command to the art, art agent.
[00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:38.460]   And the reason that they do that, I'm sure I mean, in the person to ask of course, will
[00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:43.580]   be Sal, but the, I think that the reason that they probably do that is, is because when
[00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:46.620]   we're running Apple scripts, I know we, we would have a problem with, we have a lot of
[00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:47.620]   Apple scripts.
[00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:49.260]   So we run that create folders and so on and so forth.
[00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:53.980]   And if it, and if it was a problem, yeah, you want to hit it and then have it do whatever
[00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:54.980]   it's supposed to do.
[00:37:54.980 --> 00:37:58.220]   And probably enough people were like, Oh, this is a pain in the neck that they made
[00:37:58.220 --> 00:38:01.100]   sure that that didn't run up all the time.
[00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:08.180]   So I executed, he gives us a little terminal command using the ARDA agent saying it's
[00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:14.220]   OSA script dashy, which means execute an Apple script, single quote, tell app quote,
[00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:19.780]   ARDA agent quote, to do shell script quote, who am I end quote, and it comes back, your
[00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:20.780]   root.
[00:38:20.780 --> 00:38:22.980]   Now I'm not logged in as root.
[00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:26.020]   I don't have root privileges, but it's telling me I'm root.
[00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:28.260]   So it's a ARDA agent is running as root.
[00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:29.620]   That's the flaw right there.
[00:38:29.620 --> 00:38:33.580]   And the fact that you can then script it is a huge flaw, but that's also easy for Apple
[00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:34.580]   to fix.
[00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:39.860]   I just ran who am I and it says I'm sexy hot Latin lover 82.
[00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:41.460]   Don't have a sweet lady.
[00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:42.460]   Interesting.
[00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:43.460]   That's weird.
[00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:46.060]   You might want to log out of that right away.
[00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:48.900]   Who are you people?
[00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:49.900]   Yeah.
[00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:53.060]   So anyway, you know, you're saying the lyrics, you buy that at all because I agree with you
[00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:54.780]   100% and that's the thing.
[00:38:54.780 --> 00:38:58.380]   And it's very easy for us to whistle past that graveyard because we haven't really
[00:38:58.380 --> 00:38:59.380]   had any real problems.
[00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:02.300]   Yeah, you know, we've had all these years where it really felt like for a long time,
[00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:05.620]   you know, people were trying to find some sustainable way to be not again, not perfect.
[00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:07.180]   You're never going to be perfect with this stuff.
[00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:09.940]   But on the one hand, you got the IT guys were telling you to change your password every
[00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:12.820]   week, which you then, you know, tape onto your monitor.
[00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:17.060]   But I just I wonder, I wonder if the iPhone ends up having a net effect of making people
[00:39:17.060 --> 00:39:18.060]   a little less secure.
[00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:19.540]   Oh, I'm sure it will.
[00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:22.380]   In fact, there's some I've seen a number of studies now that say these smartphones are
[00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:23.780]   really problems in general.
[00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:25.580]   I mean, the blackberry has similar issues.
[00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:28.380]   And as they try and move into enterprise markets, I said enterprise.
[00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:31.980]   And they try to move in and they're going to have a lot of questions about the IT guys
[00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:33.500]   are going to be like, how do I lock this down?
[00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:34.500]   Right.
[00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:37.060]   Like, how do I, you know, so when I especially something with the iPhone, we want one of
[00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:40.740]   the big problems without the cutting paste, I know we've complained about this before,
[00:39:40.740 --> 00:39:46.540]   you tend to make we used to have a 128 bit 128 character hash for, you know, our Wi-Fi
[00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:47.540]   here.
[00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:52.580]   And it got significantly shortened after I couldn't, there's no way you I can't see the
[00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:57.380]   characters, you know, when I'm typing into the Wi-Fi thing and on an iPhone.
[00:39:57.380 --> 00:40:01.300]   So I'm trying to log into the iPhone, I have to type 128 random characters without being
[00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:06.460]   able to see them on a, on a, on the little typewriter that comes with the iPhone.
[00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:07.900]   And after that, we shortened it.
[00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:09.820]   Okay, this isn't going to work.
[00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:13.940]   And that, so we're actually reducing some of our security based on the fact that we wanted
[00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:16.180]   to log in with the, with the, with the iPhone.
[00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:20.620]   And I wish there was even a longer character that you can put in to lock your iPhone too,
[00:40:20.620 --> 00:40:23.980]   because I mean, yeah, it's hard to time people actually, this is kind of funny because this
[00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:29.460]   weekend, I went up to Clear Lake and my friend's sister, she was watching me type of my iPhone
[00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:31.980]   and she watched me type in my key code.
[00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:35.500]   And I set it down and I saw her pick it back up, typing my key code and just, she just
[00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:36.500]   started playing with my iPhone.
[00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:38.540]   She even knows she was hacking you.
[00:40:38.540 --> 00:40:40.660]   No, when she's like, I was like, how did you do that?
[00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:41.980]   She's like, I saw you type it.
[00:40:41.980 --> 00:40:42.980]   Oh, she did.
[00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:43.980]   She was.
[00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:44.980]   Yeah.
[00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:46.980]   So there has to be something a little more difficult because I'm going to have pretty much my entire
[00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:47.980]   life in my iPhone.
[00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:49.380]   Yeah, but really show of hands.
[00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:50.380]   How many of you lock your iPhone?
[00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:51.940]   I'm surprised you lock your adjusting.
[00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:54.580]   I like buying a minute, one minute time.
[00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:55.580]   Yeah.
[00:40:55.580 --> 00:40:56.580]   You all lock your iPhone.
[00:40:56.580 --> 00:40:57.580]   Heck yeah.
[00:40:57.580 --> 00:41:01.060]   You don't Andy?
[00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:06.060]   I don't because I mean, I know that there's security problems.
[00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:08.660]   I know that for heaven's sake.
[00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:12.260]   Chris, Chris, Chris, Chris, Chris, your phone is calling and complaining.
[00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:14.700]   You definitely lock me.
[00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:15.700]   Hello, Andy.
[00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:21.900]   For me, for me locking a phone is one of those features where I will turn it on and I will
[00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:26.460]   use it and then I will basically Illinois me once too often they'll turn it back off
[00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:27.460]   again.
[00:41:27.460 --> 00:41:31.260]   So what I'm hoping for is something that's a little bit better than having to type in
[00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:32.260]   a pin.
[00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:37.100]   What I would, a real Apple solution would be not having to remember that I have to type
[00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:39.620]   to type in one, eight, eight, four.
[00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:45.220]   If it were something as simple as a gesture that I can make on the screen, a line that
[00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:51.100]   I can trace on the screen that doesn't require that section of my brain that processes numbers
[00:41:51.100 --> 00:41:53.620]   to be used, then maybe I would use it.
[00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:54.620]   I like that.
[00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:56.660]   Or even maybe like a retina scan or something.
[00:41:56.660 --> 00:41:57.900]   I think it's a little bit good.
[00:41:57.900 --> 00:42:00.660]   I think I think a little thumbprint just put your little thumbprint up against the
[00:42:00.660 --> 00:42:01.660]   against the screen.
[00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:02.660]   That would be awesome.
[00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:03.660]   I don't do any of that stuff.
[00:42:03.660 --> 00:42:06.420]   I don't think if somebody gets my phone, so what?
[00:42:06.420 --> 00:42:07.420]   I lose it.
[00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:08.420]   Depends on what you have on it.
[00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:09.420]   I lose it every day.
[00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:10.980]   I have your all your phone numbers.
[00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:13.180]   I've just seen some phone number on is that?
[00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:16.620]   Oh, actually, I recently had to get my change.
[00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:17.620]   Did you?
[00:42:17.620 --> 00:42:21.660]   The internet got my phone number and they were ordering me pizzas and kidding.
[00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:22.660]   Oh boy.
[00:42:22.660 --> 00:42:24.940]   We have a video to prove it.
[00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:26.940]   The internet is such a bad boy.
[00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:27.940]   I know.
[00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:28.940]   They weren't even paying for the pizzas.
[00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:29.940]   Oh, no, that's not nice.
[00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:32.940]   I mean, if you're going to order a just an expensive buy it.
[00:42:32.940 --> 00:42:35.340]   Dude, come on.
[00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:38.060]   You know, I gave out my son's cell phone on Twitter now.
[00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:40.700]   I didn't even think that that those kinds of things could happen.
[00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:41.700]   What?
[00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:43.700]   Are you out of your mind?
[00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:45.980]   He told you what Leo is 78 years old.
[00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:47.780]   I don't know if everybody knows that.
[00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:49.940]   You know, people do listen to this, right?
[00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:50.940]   Yeah, couple.
[00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:52.460]   No, but actually pretty funny.
[00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:53.460]   Yeah.
[00:42:53.460 --> 00:42:56.820]   Because he made me do it anyway.
[00:42:56.820 --> 00:42:59.780]   But I look at scobles on friend feed saying, hey, I'm in New York.
[00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:00.780]   Here's my cell phone.
[00:43:00.780 --> 00:43:01.780]   Call me.
[00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:04.020]   Some people will do anything for attention.
[00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:05.580]   Well, that's weird.
[00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:12.820]   I mean, just during this podcast, right now, some guy sciped me 15 times.
[00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:15.860]   No matter how many times I click, I'm trying to keep focused on the conversation.
[00:43:15.860 --> 00:43:16.860]   It's very frustrating.
[00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:18.420]   No matter how many times I click deny, he keep going back.
[00:43:18.420 --> 00:43:22.780]   I finally texted saying using a word that would give us the explicit tag, do something
[00:43:22.780 --> 00:43:26.380]   to yourself that would be biologically futile that would cause you to not interrupt me
[00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:27.380]   anymore.
[00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:32.380]   And he was annoyed and angry that, hey, man, if you know, it just goes, you know, yeah,
[00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:33.380]   exactly.
[00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:34.380]   It's like, what?
[00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:35.380]   How many?
[00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:36.380]   What?
[00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:37.380]   Just tell me what the threshold is.
[00:43:37.380 --> 00:43:40.140]   Tell me how many times I have to click decline before you get the.
[00:43:40.140 --> 00:43:41.860]   I turn into like a social network.
[00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:43.300]   It's everything's a social network.
[00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:45.860]   Now, you don't need to contact me.
[00:43:45.860 --> 00:43:46.860]   You don't need to.
[00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:51.420]   I think like, you know, if you put a new garbage can on a pal street, I think within an hour
[00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:53.220]   it's going to have 150 friends.
[00:43:53.220 --> 00:43:54.220]   You know, it's weird.
[00:43:54.220 --> 00:43:56.220]   When is this going to end?
[00:43:56.220 --> 00:43:57.820]   That's the best quote ever.
[00:43:57.820 --> 00:43:59.820]   This is San Francisco.
[00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:00.820]   Thanks for the ad.
[00:44:00.820 --> 00:44:01.820]   A con.
[00:44:01.820 --> 00:44:07.660]   Another thing too is when they got my number, they called AT&T and reported my phone stolen.
[00:44:07.660 --> 00:44:10.100]   So AT&T shut off my service.
[00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:12.900]   And I called and they said, well, it's going to be a fee to reactivate.
[00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:14.220]   And I was like, you know what?
[00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:17.260]   You're not going to charge me and you're going to change my number right now.
[00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:18.260]   Okay.
[00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:19.260]   So.
[00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:20.260]   Did they ask you how your number got out?
[00:44:20.260 --> 00:44:23.700]   I mean, did they do they understand that you're an internet superstar and that's what happened?
[00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:25.940]   Do you know who it started off with?
[00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:26.940]   Do you know who I am?
[00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:27.940]   I would just love you.
[00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:29.940]   I think it would be great.
[00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:35.460]   Like you can get services like Grand Central and VIA talk and all these places that will
[00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:39.340]   enable you to kind of virtualize your phone experience.
[00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:42.620]   I think we need, I don't know what this looks like.
[00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:48.460]   Maybe something beyond the typical, you know, 10 digit or, yeah, there's a 10 right with
[00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:49.460]   the 10.
[00:44:49.460 --> 00:44:51.580]   And maybe something beyond that.
[00:44:51.580 --> 00:44:53.420]   Maybe it's something where I don't know what this looks like.
[00:44:53.420 --> 00:44:56.700]   But I think you should be able to basically change your phone number the same way that
[00:44:56.700 --> 00:44:57.900]   you would change a password.
[00:44:57.900 --> 00:45:00.060]   I think there should be like, you should be able to throw away.
[00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:03.980]   You should have some root like way that people get to your phone and then I think you should
[00:45:03.980 --> 00:45:04.980]   have a numerable way.
[00:45:04.980 --> 00:45:06.380]   That's actually a great idea.
[00:45:06.380 --> 00:45:07.380]   That wrote away.
[00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:08.980]   We do that with email addresses, right?
[00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:09.980]   You use a redirector.
[00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:10.980]   You'll have a one box.com.
[00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:12.940]   Like it's something, you know, somebody calls me.
[00:45:12.940 --> 00:45:14.580]   All of my stuff gets wired through.
[00:45:14.580 --> 00:45:15.580]   Yeah.
[00:45:15.580 --> 00:45:16.580]   Incredibly rigid.
[00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:18.460]   Well, of course, now people will test it.
[00:45:18.460 --> 00:45:22.140]   I do, I do as much as possible try to minimize the amount of unnecessary phone calls that
[00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:23.140]   I get.
[00:45:23.140 --> 00:45:25.940]   And that's by design because I don't want to sit around and talk on the phone all day.
[00:45:25.940 --> 00:45:30.020]   But you know, so sometimes I've got to give out myself number and then it's like, you
[00:45:30.020 --> 00:45:33.820]   know, you know, I, I just want to take the much better.
[00:45:33.820 --> 00:45:39.100]   The much better solution is if we were able to sort of do the same thing with phone numbers,
[00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:44.140]   what we do with email addresses where I can give out a public email address that if there's
[00:45:44.140 --> 00:45:48.180]   a problem with that email address, I can simply change it because I'm the, the purpose of
[00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:50.900]   that address is just afforded to my real address.
[00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:58.300]   I have, I have to keep my old phone number that I've had since like 1989 because there's
[00:45:58.300 --> 00:46:03.620]   still people, especially in PR, my, my name is in so many PR databases that it just will
[00:46:03.620 --> 00:46:06.500]   never, you know, filter out there.
[00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:09.780]   Just this year, there was one important announcement I didn't get from Apple because they called
[00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:10.780]   that old phone number.
[00:46:10.780 --> 00:46:14.740]   Or at least it got, it got delayed because right now if you call that old phone number,
[00:46:14.740 --> 00:46:19.460]   you just get a message saying, don't leave a message, email me at this address.
[00:46:19.460 --> 00:46:22.500]   If you're a human being, if you're a computer, don't bother.
[00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:27.540]   If I have the ability to simply tell AT&T or tell Verizon or tell whatever company, anytime
[00:46:27.540 --> 00:46:31.260]   someone calls that number, just kick it forward to this number without having to pay an extra
[00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:32.260]   10 bucks a month.
[00:46:32.260 --> 00:46:33.580]   I think we're almost there.
[00:46:33.580 --> 00:46:37.100]   I mean, that's, that's the whole point of the, all of this kind of meta social networking.
[00:46:37.100 --> 00:46:40.860]   I think that we're very close to having something like that.
[00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:44.340]   Maybe even already, you know, use an internet site that forwards you through.
[00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:46.140]   You never have to give out your actual number.
[00:46:46.140 --> 00:46:49.500]   Well, and I mean, like, I, not to turn this into a 43 folders thing, but I think this
[00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:53.740]   goes straight to an issue that almost everybody's suffering from right now, which is trying
[00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:57.140]   to figure out how you allow people to have access to you.
[00:46:57.140 --> 00:47:00.380]   But how do you regulate that in a way that's saying you don't ever want to, you don't want
[00:47:00.380 --> 00:47:03.660]   to get to a point where you say, okay, nobody can ever contact me because, you know, even
[00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:07.260]   if you don't do client work, you still have, there's great people out there and you want
[00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:08.260]   people to contact you.
[00:47:08.260 --> 00:47:12.660]   But what we need, what we need though is a way to regulate how, where, when and for how
[00:47:12.660 --> 00:47:14.020]   long people get at us.
[00:47:14.020 --> 00:47:15.020]   And that's where that fails right now.
[00:47:15.020 --> 00:47:17.380]   So I don't have a way to queue up SMS.
[00:47:17.380 --> 00:47:18.380]   It just keeps interrupting me.
[00:47:18.380 --> 00:47:19.380]   It dings all the time.
[00:47:19.380 --> 00:47:22.500]   I don't have a way to say like, it's, it's very, it's very, very easy.
[00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:25.620]   One of the, one of the bits of my father's wisdom that I will carry with me too, the
[00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:29.620]   end of my days is, you know, with a phone would ring and the kids would like scramble
[00:47:29.620 --> 00:47:30.620]   to get it.
[00:47:30.620 --> 00:47:35.060]   He'd say, sit down, the phone is there for our convenience, not the rest of the world's.
[00:47:35.060 --> 00:47:37.500]   You just have the ability to simply say, you know what, it's ringing.
[00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:38.740]   I'm just going to let it ring.
[00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:39.740]   I totally agree.
[00:47:39.740 --> 00:47:40.740]   I just demand.
[00:47:40.740 --> 00:47:43.860]   What I hear people saying when I go and speak to a group and they have me come in and
[00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:47.780]   talk about things like email is that this is, there's simply no condition anymore where
[00:47:47.780 --> 00:47:49.500]   they cannot be available.
[00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:50.500]   And now, I mean, I'm sorry.
[00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:53.100]   I don't want to turn this into a whole rant about my deal, but I think it's something
[00:47:53.100 --> 00:47:54.100]   people are suffering from.
[00:47:54.100 --> 00:47:58.020]   And I think having some way to start collecting this stuff and not just, I'm not saying like,
[00:47:58.020 --> 00:48:00.140]   hey, we need another plug in for Outlook.
[00:48:00.140 --> 00:48:02.020]   It's more like, you know, we really need.
[00:48:02.020 --> 00:48:06.500]   You know, maybe, maybe we need just, I use the answering machine to screen all the calls
[00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:07.500]   at home.
[00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:09.700]   I wish we had that kind of screening capability on a cell phone.
[00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:10.700]   Yeah.
[00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:11.700]   Maybe something like that.
[00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:14.300]   And I say, hey, who's calling you want to talk to him?
[00:48:14.300 --> 00:48:16.620]   I know, I know, kills me when people turn off caller ID.
[00:48:16.620 --> 00:48:18.060]   I just, I won't answer the phone.
[00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:19.380]   Oh, no, that's blocked.
[00:48:19.380 --> 00:48:20.780]   You can't get through to me without calling.
[00:48:20.780 --> 00:48:21.780]   Yeah.
[00:48:21.780 --> 00:48:22.780]   Yeah.
[00:48:22.780 --> 00:48:25.780]   And that, do you do that thing where the phone company will say this person is not accepting?
[00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:27.420]   That's not used by a talk.
[00:48:27.420 --> 00:48:28.780]   It'll say, hi, you're blocked.
[00:48:28.780 --> 00:48:31.860]   You go call from a number where, or say who you are, and then I will decide if we can
[00:48:31.860 --> 00:48:32.860]   talk to you.
[00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:33.860]   Yeah, the phone company will do that for you too.
[00:48:33.860 --> 00:48:37.620]   I think I'm a big jerk, but like, get ready guys, because it's going to be like this all
[00:48:37.620 --> 00:48:38.620]   day long.
[00:48:38.620 --> 00:48:39.860]   Your phone is going to be ringing all the time.
[00:48:39.860 --> 00:48:42.700]   So it becomes more easy programmatically to contact you.
[00:48:42.700 --> 00:48:47.340]   And the other thing is, is that I found that I lent my brother my laptop.
[00:48:47.340 --> 00:48:49.620]   He had to do some training down in Cupertino.
[00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:53.540]   And so he had my laptop and I was using my Mac mini, which just checks all my mail, but
[00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:54.540]   doesn't have my rules.
[00:48:54.540 --> 00:48:57.660]   My rules, for some reason, when I did the sink, didn't have it.
[00:48:57.660 --> 00:49:02.500]   So I didn't realize, I didn't realize what my rules had been doing, you know, because
[00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:06.540]   suddenly it was just this, I can understand now why people get upset when they get all
[00:49:06.540 --> 00:49:10.300]   this email, because it was suddenly this incredible flow of email, because I get like
[00:49:10.300 --> 00:49:12.140]   400 or 500 emails a day.
[00:49:12.140 --> 00:49:16.020]   But I only have to look at about, you know, 50 of them, you know, 50 or 60 of them are
[00:49:16.020 --> 00:49:19.180]   actually critical, mission critical that I have to look at.
[00:49:19.180 --> 00:49:21.820]   And I have all these codes, like the different people that I talked to, I said, put this
[00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:24.300]   in the subject or put that into this or put this into this.
[00:49:24.300 --> 00:49:26.420]   And that, and it sorts everything.
[00:49:26.420 --> 00:49:30.300]   And you know, so there's, you know, that helps me a lot.
[00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:34.740]   And I didn't realize how much it helped me until I was suddenly without it.
[00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:35.740]   I didn't want to create them again.
[00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:38.620]   I mean, there's 60 rules, you know, that say, if this person emails, you put it in this
[00:49:38.620 --> 00:49:42.100]   folder, if they put this in the subject, put it in that folder, if it's according to this
[00:49:42.100 --> 00:49:44.100]   project in front of those rules, I love my rules.
[00:49:44.100 --> 00:49:45.100]   Oh my gosh.
[00:49:45.100 --> 00:49:48.740]   And people who don't use rule, I mean, well, I use I'm, I use a fast mail.
[00:49:48.740 --> 00:49:51.420]   Yeah, you use fast mail too, right, Merlin?
[00:49:51.420 --> 00:49:56.300]   And fast mail has this great, spamsive scripting language for the, for the, I'm actually trying
[00:49:56.300 --> 00:49:57.740]   to move all the way over to Gmail.
[00:49:57.740 --> 00:50:00.580]   What the thing that I wish mail, that's why I didn't move to Gmail because of this.
[00:50:00.580 --> 00:50:02.380]   Does that have spams or say something?
[00:50:02.380 --> 00:50:04.580]   Just indifference to Microsoft.
[00:50:04.580 --> 00:50:08.740]   There's one thing that Outlook does straight out of the box that every email program should
[00:50:08.740 --> 00:50:09.740]   be able to do.
[00:50:09.740 --> 00:50:10.940]   And I will share that with you now.
[00:50:10.940 --> 00:50:16.100]   You should be able to create the most basic rule in the world, which says, let me know
[00:50:16.100 --> 00:50:18.380]   if I was the sole recipient of this message.
[00:50:18.380 --> 00:50:22.180]   Like, nobody else, the two line, nobody on the CC line.
[00:50:22.180 --> 00:50:23.180]   But you know what?
[00:50:23.180 --> 00:50:24.180]   How about this?
[00:50:24.180 --> 00:50:27.420]   How about create a mailbox that shows just stuff I received today that I was the recipient
[00:50:27.420 --> 00:50:28.420]   of.
[00:50:28.420 --> 00:50:29.420]   And you can't do that.
[00:50:29.420 --> 00:50:30.420]   It's not, I should do a post about this.
[00:50:30.420 --> 00:50:32.220]   It's hard to do without basically like Apple scripts.
[00:50:32.220 --> 00:50:33.220]   You can't script it.
[00:50:33.220 --> 00:50:34.220]   Yeah.
[00:50:34.220 --> 00:50:36.420]   There's no, if you go and look at the things you can search on in mail, it's not easy
[00:50:36.420 --> 00:50:37.420]   to do.
[00:50:37.420 --> 00:50:38.740]   But to me, that's step zero.
[00:50:38.740 --> 00:50:41.820]   Step zero is, okay, let me first start by looking at just the stuff that somebody took
[00:50:41.820 --> 00:50:43.500]   the time to write just to me.
[00:50:43.500 --> 00:50:47.940]   And I hear people at, you know, kind of mid-level through the C levels who are saying, like,
[00:50:47.940 --> 00:50:51.500]   this is literally the only way they get through their day is focusing first on stuff that
[00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:52.500]   was just to them.
[00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:53.500]   Because that's the most important.
[00:50:53.500 --> 00:50:54.500]   Yeah.
[00:50:54.500 --> 00:50:55.500]   And we're moving that way with phones.
[00:50:55.500 --> 00:50:57.580]   I mean, if you look at Grand Central, I use got email.
[00:50:57.580 --> 00:51:01.740]   A lot of these digital phone systems really give you a lot of those capabilities to control
[00:51:01.740 --> 00:51:05.460]   who gets through how, what box they get, where they go.
[00:51:05.460 --> 00:51:08.140]   You can screen callers with Grand Central, which is really cool.
[00:51:08.140 --> 00:51:09.140]   Yeah.
[00:51:09.140 --> 00:51:10.820]   I throw down a, can I throw down, I'll shut up after this.
[00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:12.820]   Can I throw down a Mac Break Weekly Challenge, Leo LePor?
[00:51:12.820 --> 00:51:14.380]   Yes, you can, Merlin, Matt.
[00:51:14.380 --> 00:51:15.380]   I'm Mac, Brooke.
[00:51:15.380 --> 00:51:18.820]   My Mac, because this is easier than typing this myself, my Mac Break Weekly Challenge
[00:51:18.820 --> 00:51:25.860]   to you, the nation, is how would you using either Gmail or preferably even Mail.app, but
[00:51:25.860 --> 00:51:29.100]   tell me how you would, you would filter out stuff that was just to you.
[00:51:29.100 --> 00:51:30.100]   Is it even possible?
[00:51:30.100 --> 00:51:32.020]   And tell us again why you think that's important.
[00:51:32.020 --> 00:51:33.020]   What is it about this stuff?
[00:51:33.020 --> 00:51:36.060]   Because I get a lot of stuff that's to me, but then they see other people.
[00:51:36.060 --> 00:51:37.620]   You don't want to see that stuff?
[00:51:37.620 --> 00:51:38.620]   Here's the thing.
[00:51:38.620 --> 00:51:41.860]   On one end of the continuum, I just did a bit on this for Spark, the CPC Spark show that
[00:51:41.860 --> 00:51:42.860]   I contribute to.
[00:51:42.860 --> 00:51:46.220]   I think on the one end of the continuum, it's very easy to make decisions about junk mail.
[00:51:46.220 --> 00:51:47.220]   Right?
[00:51:47.220 --> 00:51:48.220]   Well, never need junk mail.
[00:51:48.220 --> 00:51:49.700]   It has no use in every way you get rid of it.
[00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:51.940]   Then you get into the, you get into kind of the bacon, right?
[00:51:51.940 --> 00:51:54.700]   You get into the like the Facebook stuff that's on the page by the YouTube stuff.
[00:51:54.700 --> 00:51:58.460]   Then you get into what I started to call turkey bacon, which is like bacon, but from
[00:51:58.460 --> 00:51:59.460]   your family.
[00:51:59.460 --> 00:52:02.900]   And it's all the like, you know, hyponermic needles in the ball pit and McDonald's kind
[00:52:02.900 --> 00:52:03.900]   of stuff.
[00:52:03.900 --> 00:52:04.900]   Right.
[00:52:04.900 --> 00:52:06.500]   You know, Obama's Muslim kind of stuff.
[00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:08.420]   And I think after that point, it's just, you know,
[00:52:08.420 --> 00:52:10.180]   Jared's dead kind of stuff.
[00:52:10.180 --> 00:52:13.420]   Yeah, but then you get into, he's not dead, by the way.
[00:52:13.420 --> 00:52:14.420]   He's fine.
[00:52:14.420 --> 00:52:15.420]   No, no, no.
[00:52:15.420 --> 00:52:18.780]   Anyway, but then you get into stuff where, okay, all of a sudden, okay, there's lots of
[00:52:18.780 --> 00:52:20.060]   mailing lists.
[00:52:20.060 --> 00:52:23.300]   There's lots of stuff where if you have anybody that's reporting to you, you're going to get
[00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:24.980]   CC'd on everything.
[00:52:24.980 --> 00:52:28.380]   You're going to start seeing all this stuff where, you know, just kind of the bonehead
[00:52:28.380 --> 00:52:32.100]   filter stuff where they've, it's two 96 people.
[00:52:32.100 --> 00:52:34.060]   And I'm not saying you shouldn't read that email.
[00:52:34.060 --> 00:52:36.220]   No, but it doesn't need to be the first thing you read.
[00:52:36.220 --> 00:52:38.020]   It just about qualifies as bacon.
[00:52:38.020 --> 00:52:39.020]   Yeah.
[00:52:39.020 --> 00:52:41.940]   And I think based on that's the first rule should be is it's just to me.
[00:52:41.940 --> 00:52:43.260]   And then there are all tons of stuff.
[00:52:43.260 --> 00:52:45.940]   So just one tip that I will offer.
[00:52:45.940 --> 00:52:48.260]   Use a dress book to create groups.
[00:52:48.260 --> 00:52:52.300]   If you create a dress book groups, you can then filter based on those groups in Mail.app.
[00:52:52.300 --> 00:52:53.700]   And a lot of people don't know that.
[00:52:53.700 --> 00:52:56.780]   So you could say, show me stuff that I've received today that's from people that meet
[00:52:56.780 --> 00:52:58.260]   this criteria.
[00:52:58.260 --> 00:52:59.500]   That's one way.
[00:52:59.500 --> 00:53:02.580]   But I think any way that we can start putting up filters that let us be a little more sensible
[00:53:02.580 --> 00:53:05.900]   about what's really an emergency and what's really important is going to be huge.
[00:53:05.900 --> 00:53:07.300]   I kind of do that Merlin.
[00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:11.780]   The way I do that is with Civ on on on the fast mail, which is an IMEP server.
[00:53:11.780 --> 00:53:16.180]   And what I do is I filter, I put all the filters up front.
[00:53:16.180 --> 00:53:23.060]   And then if it trickles through all of those filters and then it just has to me in it,
[00:53:23.060 --> 00:53:24.860]   it will finally end up in the Leo mailbox.
[00:53:24.860 --> 00:53:30.820]   So by putting that as the last rule, you actually, so you, that's my way of doing it.
[00:53:30.820 --> 00:53:33.300]   It's a little upside down, but you pre filter everything.
[00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:34.300]   You kind of do it in the opposite order.
[00:53:34.300 --> 00:53:35.300]   You want to read it.
[00:53:35.300 --> 00:53:37.300]   Does it make sense?
[00:53:37.300 --> 00:53:38.300]   Yeah, it does.
[00:53:38.300 --> 00:53:41.300]   And I got to tell you, I kind of move away from fast mail because Gmail so much is doing
[00:53:41.300 --> 00:53:42.300]   what I need to do.
[00:53:42.300 --> 00:53:43.300]   It doesn't have Civ.
[00:53:43.300 --> 00:53:44.300]   It needs Civ.
[00:53:44.300 --> 00:53:45.300]   You're right.
[00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:46.300]   Well, there's an open source program.
[00:53:46.300 --> 00:53:47.300]   I don't know why they implement.
[00:53:47.300 --> 00:53:48.300]   Don't implement that.
[00:53:48.300 --> 00:53:49.300]   Yeah.
[00:53:49.300 --> 00:53:51.780]   It would be really, it would be really useful because all of that you're applying a very
[00:53:51.780 --> 00:53:55.340]   basic, you know, if you know the first thing about programming, civil instantly makes sense
[00:53:55.340 --> 00:53:56.340]   to you.
[00:53:56.340 --> 00:53:57.340]   It's, you know, it's.
[00:53:57.340 --> 00:53:58.340]   It's a riot.
[00:53:58.340 --> 00:54:04.100]   It riot 2003 in the IRC chat says Gmail has indicators for messages sent only to you.
[00:54:04.100 --> 00:54:06.660]   They do and they have that on the iPhone too, which is pretty useful.
[00:54:06.660 --> 00:54:10.100]   And the worst, how does that, how do you get that?
[00:54:10.100 --> 00:54:14.660]   There's just a setting that you can say just label as two messages, which is pretty cool.
[00:54:14.660 --> 00:54:18.580]   But the worst thing that you get are the PR messages that kind of feel like they're addressed
[00:54:18.580 --> 00:54:19.580]   to you.
[00:54:19.580 --> 00:54:20.580]   I hate those.
[00:54:20.580 --> 00:54:21.580]   I hate them.
[00:54:21.580 --> 00:54:22.580]   Yeah.
[00:54:22.580 --> 00:54:23.580]   Or they just do you.
[00:54:23.580 --> 00:54:26.900]   Is there some PR you like to get in others you don't like to get it, Justine?
[00:54:26.900 --> 00:54:30.700]   Yeah, but some of it, I mean, it's, it's just interesting too, because some of the people
[00:54:30.700 --> 00:54:34.260]   will make it seem like it's to you, but it's actually to a whole list of people that just
[00:54:34.260 --> 00:54:35.260]   I did.
[00:54:35.260 --> 00:54:36.260]   I did.
[00:54:36.260 --> 00:54:37.820]   I stole a trick from Matt Howie and Gina, Japan.
[00:54:37.820 --> 00:54:38.900]   And I'll just be dead honest.
[00:54:38.900 --> 00:54:44.020]   I created a rule in Gmail that has an array basically with pipes that basically just
[00:54:44.020 --> 00:54:51.020]   deletes from about 100 different PR companies, just delete it automatically.
[00:54:51.020 --> 00:54:52.500]   Is vision one of those companies now?
[00:54:52.500 --> 00:54:53.500]   Oh, you know what?
[00:54:53.500 --> 00:54:54.500]   Don't get me started talking about Sitchin.
[00:54:54.500 --> 00:54:57.300]   It's a boil the ocean bottle and it's a shame that you've got to do that.
[00:54:57.300 --> 00:54:59.100]   But I mean, there's actually, there is neat stuff.
[00:54:59.100 --> 00:55:00.940]   I should say Gina's written about this on Life Hacker.
[00:55:00.940 --> 00:55:04.660]   She written some great stuff about, I think really Life Hacker's coverage of Gmail and
[00:55:04.660 --> 00:55:06.860]   Firefox is some of the best around.
[00:55:06.860 --> 00:55:10.220]   And the stuff she said about how you can automate this stuff, you know, once you get
[00:55:10.220 --> 00:55:14.420]   comfortable with writing logical stuff in the full message area of Gmail, there's all
[00:55:14.420 --> 00:55:15.420]   kinds of stuff you can do.
[00:55:15.420 --> 00:55:18.580]   Well, I'm going to take a look at this, Merlin, because I, you know, I am the only reason
[00:55:18.580 --> 00:55:22.500]   I still pay and I pay a lot for a fast mail is because of that SIV capability.
[00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:26.860]   If you think I could do the same thing with pipes and stuff like that?
[00:55:26.860 --> 00:55:28.300]   No, not nearly.
[00:55:28.300 --> 00:55:30.580]   I mean, dude, I just, I used to be really.
[00:55:30.580 --> 00:55:32.380]   How do you live with that SIV?
[00:55:32.380 --> 00:55:34.220]   I used to be so tight wound about the stuff.
[00:55:34.220 --> 00:55:36.540]   I'd go into the custom view, you know, there's.
[00:55:36.540 --> 00:55:37.940]   I have a long SIV script.
[00:55:37.940 --> 00:55:39.420]   I have a custom SIV script.
[00:55:39.420 --> 00:55:40.420]   Yeah.
[00:55:40.420 --> 00:55:41.420]   And Leo's got it.
[00:55:41.420 --> 00:55:45.620]   I mean, if there's a cascade for how it evaluates all of that, it's pretty, it's pretty amazing.
[00:55:45.620 --> 00:55:50.580]   You can get down to like people when it matches this criteria, return this message, like right
[00:55:50.580 --> 00:55:52.100]   this person back with this mess.
[00:55:52.100 --> 00:55:53.580]   So you could actually use it to automate.
[00:55:53.580 --> 00:55:54.580]   Oh, you can.
[00:55:54.580 --> 00:55:58.660]   And there are wikis with this, although the people who really do this use proc mail, I
[00:55:58.660 --> 00:56:00.580]   mean, that's what you really want to do is you want to be a Linux server.
[00:56:00.580 --> 00:56:02.420]   It's like, well, the nicest tapping on the server.
[00:56:02.420 --> 00:56:03.420]   Right.
[00:56:03.420 --> 00:56:05.420]   So if it's before it gets before it gets to the phone.
[00:56:05.420 --> 00:56:06.420]   Yeah.
[00:56:06.420 --> 00:56:07.420]   Yeah.
[00:56:07.420 --> 00:56:09.900]   Actually, I am really curious about the Gmail feature.
[00:56:09.900 --> 00:56:10.900]   I will look for that.
[00:56:10.900 --> 00:56:11.900]   I've spent a fair amount of time.
[00:56:11.900 --> 00:56:12.900]   I've never seen that.
[00:56:12.900 --> 00:56:13.900]   So where is it?
[00:56:13.900 --> 00:56:16.500]   Can you remember where that is, Justine on Gmail?
[00:56:16.500 --> 00:56:17.940]   Is it the settings?
[00:56:17.940 --> 00:56:18.940]   Is it?
[00:56:18.940 --> 00:56:20.380]   Is it so it's not a rule?
[00:56:20.380 --> 00:56:21.380]   It's let's see.
[00:56:21.380 --> 00:56:22.380]   Filter.
[00:56:22.380 --> 00:56:23.380]   Is it a filter?
[00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:26.340]   Well, oh, I see you're saying so show indicators.
[00:56:26.340 --> 00:56:30.700]   Just play an arrow by messages sent to my address and a double area arrow by messages sent
[00:56:30.700 --> 00:56:31.700]   only to me.
[00:56:31.700 --> 00:56:35.420]   Yeah, I do have that check, but I don't think there's a way to filter based on that.
[00:56:35.420 --> 00:56:36.900]   I don't know about the filter.
[00:56:36.900 --> 00:56:39.260]   The filter's not as sophisticated as they need to be.
[00:56:39.260 --> 00:56:41.900]   It's just funny because I mean, there's all the stuff we've got to do that again, boiling
[00:56:41.900 --> 00:56:43.860]   the ocean to try and make this stuff work.
[00:56:43.860 --> 00:56:49.900]   And I understand what like if people just don't write the email, like just give us kind
[00:56:49.900 --> 00:56:51.100]   of some stuff here.
[00:56:51.100 --> 00:56:52.100]   That's not going to happen.
[00:56:52.100 --> 00:56:57.220]   I think for me, for me at least the best solution would be for me to go back in time 15, 20
[00:56:57.220 --> 00:57:02.340]   years and just make sure that you set up separate email accounts for every different
[00:57:02.340 --> 00:57:04.780]   aspect of your life and keep that stuff compartmentalized.
[00:57:04.780 --> 00:57:05.780]   It doesn't work.
[00:57:05.780 --> 00:57:07.780]   All it takes is fine.
[00:57:07.780 --> 00:57:12.620]   Well, because I mean, every time I try to be, I really should be one of these guys who
[00:57:12.620 --> 00:57:17.660]   creates all these just ninja level Apple scripts and uses an app like mailsmith, which is
[00:57:17.660 --> 00:57:23.900]   really, really good at sifting a big fire hose of incoming email into different destinations
[00:57:23.900 --> 00:57:25.420]   and actions.
[00:57:25.420 --> 00:57:30.460]   But it'll always be a kind of go back to the time of the to something I was saying earlier,
[00:57:30.460 --> 00:57:35.980]   all that has to happen is that first time it just fails for you, at which point the first
[00:57:35.980 --> 00:57:40.500]   time that there's like an invitation to say, hey, you know, we'd like to send you out
[00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:42.380]   to China to give a talk.
[00:57:42.380 --> 00:57:43.380]   What is this coming?
[00:57:43.380 --> 00:57:46.420]   Hey, how come I didn't get this like this first day?
[00:57:46.420 --> 00:57:47.420]   It's actually perfect.
[00:57:47.420 --> 00:57:48.660]   It's a perfect example.
[00:57:48.660 --> 00:57:52.260]   It was because it was from it was because it was about China because with someone you
[00:57:52.260 --> 00:57:55.740]   never heard from before and was phrasing the way of a pitch.
[00:57:55.740 --> 00:57:56.740]   And I'm sorry.
[00:57:56.740 --> 00:58:00.420]   I thought I was doing you a favor by basically choosing you out of this really great opportunity.
[00:58:00.420 --> 00:58:06.500]   You know, that's why, you know, there's all these at the meatpacking plant, there are
[00:58:06.500 --> 00:58:09.580]   all these sensors and all these different arrays and all this technology to make sure
[00:58:09.580 --> 00:58:12.940]   there aren't any screws or bolt heads or hooves left in the hamburger meat.
[00:58:12.940 --> 00:58:16.100]   But there's still a couple of like 60, 70 year old ladies at the end of the processing
[00:58:16.100 --> 00:58:20.020]   line that just visually looks at everything coming off the line to make sure that there's
[00:58:20.020 --> 00:58:21.860]   nothing that got missed.
[00:58:21.860 --> 00:58:22.860]   So we need to.
[00:58:22.860 --> 00:58:28.700]   I mean, I mean, somebody that the ultimate filter is just a more email looked at by somebody.
[00:58:28.700 --> 00:58:31.020]   I actually that's me.
[00:58:31.020 --> 00:58:35.660]   I mean, my approach still tends to be there are a couple of filters in place that does
[00:58:35.660 --> 00:58:40.860]   some of the bulk sorting, but it still comes down to me eyeballing pretty much every piece
[00:58:40.860 --> 00:58:45.540]   of email that comes in just to make sure that, you know, and I'm telling you, once a week,
[00:58:45.540 --> 00:58:50.060]   I have these really, really severe draconian spam filters on.
[00:58:50.060 --> 00:58:54.860]   And once a week, I'll find at least one piece of email that I'm like, Oh, thank God, I
[00:58:54.860 --> 00:58:56.260]   didn't miss that one.
[00:58:56.260 --> 00:58:58.380]   Merlin, you pay you pay somebody to do this?
[00:58:58.380 --> 00:58:59.380]   You said you got somebody.
[00:58:59.380 --> 00:59:05.380]   Well, I finally broke down and got this totally amazing assistant who helps me with that.
[00:59:05.380 --> 00:59:06.380]   I do that too.
[00:59:06.380 --> 00:59:08.380]   I have somebody answering my.
[00:59:08.380 --> 00:59:09.380]   Well, yeah.
[00:59:09.380 --> 00:59:10.380]   And she's.
[00:59:10.380 --> 00:59:13.380]   A human is always going to be better than an automated filter.
[00:59:13.380 --> 00:59:16.380]   But you know, but you got you're exactly right, Andy.
[00:59:16.380 --> 00:59:20.380]   I mean, anyway, we're probably going on too long ago about this, but I think this is like
[00:59:20.380 --> 00:59:22.380]   a such a primary problem that people are struggling with.
[00:59:22.380 --> 00:59:23.380]   I know it's a problem.
[00:59:23.380 --> 00:59:24.380]   I'm just struggling with anyway.
[00:59:24.380 --> 00:59:25.380]   And I think that's a good thing.
[00:59:25.380 --> 00:59:28.380]   It's like, you're right, it's like anything.
[00:59:28.380 --> 00:59:32.380]   If people want, especially with email programs, like, okay, quick thing.
[00:59:32.380 --> 00:59:35.380]   This last week, NPR's had this whole crazy like, yeah, email, everybody's freaking out
[00:59:35.380 --> 00:59:37.380]   series on a morning edition.
[00:59:37.380 --> 00:59:41.380]   And, you know, it's something they've mostly written it from press releases from companies
[00:59:41.380 --> 00:59:43.380]   that have some solution that's going to fix this stuff.
[00:59:43.380 --> 00:59:48.380]   And like every one of these solutions that people come up with still doesn't, isn't
[00:59:48.380 --> 00:59:50.380]   going to fix the basic human problem.
[00:59:50.380 --> 00:59:53.380]   And it's a problem of every productivity application too, which is that you're there
[00:59:53.380 --> 00:59:55.380]   because you're good at thinking about stuff.
[00:59:55.380 --> 00:59:59.380]   And you can automate a certain amount of this, but you're right, Andy, as long as you still
[00:59:59.380 --> 01:00:04.380]   have to look for earrings and bolts and 1% of the beef, it's still going to be a huge
[01:00:04.380 --> 01:00:05.380]   job.
[01:00:05.380 --> 01:00:08.380]   But, you know, but I got to say, let's look at it this way, though.
[01:00:08.380 --> 01:00:13.380]   Like when you rather have a mechanism that goes, well, out of the 15,000 tons of beef
[01:00:13.380 --> 01:00:17.380]   that got processed today, you know, we took out everything that's definitely rotten.
[01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:18.380]   And that's what I'm looking for.
[01:00:18.380 --> 01:00:22.380]   I'm looking for something that like helps harden my security on stuff that I know I never
[01:00:22.380 --> 01:00:23.380]   need to see.
[01:00:23.380 --> 01:00:26.380]   Yeah, I mean, I can afford to do that on my iPhone.
[01:00:26.380 --> 01:00:28.380]   It's an absolute necessity on my iPhone.
[01:00:28.380 --> 01:00:33.380]   But if not for the, I mean, there's a special account that my iPhone picks up that has
[01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:38.380]   essentially whitelisted email and stuff that is just obviously not not spam.
[01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:42.380]   But there's always, like, I can afford that because I know that when as soon as I get
[01:00:42.380 --> 01:00:47.380]   home, I can go back to that iMac that has every single email that came in in one big
[01:00:47.380 --> 01:00:51.380]   pile that could just simply quickly scan to make sure there wasn't anything I missed.
[01:00:51.380 --> 01:00:53.380]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[01:00:53.380 --> 01:00:57.380]   I think this is a great subject and I would love to do a whole show on it.
[01:00:57.380 --> 01:00:59.380]   I mean, it's clearly a problem for everybody.
[01:00:59.380 --> 01:01:00.380]   Well, not everybody.
[01:01:00.380 --> 01:01:02.380]   Everybody who gets a lot of email, which isn't everybody.
[01:01:02.380 --> 01:01:05.380]   You know, we could do maybe a couple of theme shows.
[01:01:05.380 --> 01:01:08.380]   It may have to do them all in a row, but it would be kind of fun to talk about, like,
[01:01:08.380 --> 01:01:11.380]   you know, I mean, I'd love to share stuff like that I do with Adian.
[01:01:11.380 --> 01:01:16.380]   Adian is an IAM program that lets you just be visible to certain groups of people, you
[01:01:16.380 --> 01:01:19.380]   know, or look at things you can do with things like mail tags.
[01:01:19.380 --> 01:01:23.380]   And there's all these different things that can at least take the edge off some of this.
[01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:24.380]   I think that'd be a great series.
[01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:28.380]   Yeah, I mean, everybody's still waiting for you to do a productivity show, Merlin.
[01:01:28.380 --> 01:01:30.380]   You're doing everything but a productivity show.
[01:01:30.380 --> 01:01:34.380]   I guess that's what you go give speeches about, but and many of those speeches are
[01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:35.380]   online and great.
[01:01:35.380 --> 01:01:37.380]   Oh, I'll show a productivity show.
[01:01:37.380 --> 01:01:40.380]   But I mean, seriously, that's what we want.
[01:01:40.380 --> 01:01:42.380]   We want Merlin's productivity show.
[01:01:42.380 --> 01:01:44.380]   Don't you do one?
[01:01:44.380 --> 01:01:45.380]   Do you do one?
[01:01:45.380 --> 01:01:46.380]   Am I missing some?
[01:01:46.380 --> 01:01:49.380]   You used to do some podcasts of 43 folders.
[01:01:49.380 --> 01:01:50.380]   You still do this?
[01:01:50.380 --> 01:01:51.380]   Yeah, no, I should.
[01:01:51.380 --> 01:01:52.380]   I should do that.
[01:01:52.380 --> 01:01:53.380]   We got cameras.
[01:01:53.380 --> 01:01:57.380]   I think it should be an audio show because that's more productive, frankly, right?
[01:01:57.380 --> 01:02:00.380]   There's a lot of stuff out there about tools.
[01:02:00.380 --> 01:02:03.380]   And then I think there's a fair amount of stuff about their about advice.
[01:02:03.380 --> 01:02:06.380]   But I think what people struggle with is really like, show me where's the nexus of
[01:02:06.380 --> 01:02:10.380]   taking all these great tools and then figuring out how to use them in a sustainable way.
[01:02:10.380 --> 01:02:11.380]   Well, and that's what Lifehacker is.
[01:02:11.380 --> 01:02:15.380]   I mean, Lifehacker is really about tools and merging the meshing, the
[01:02:15.380 --> 01:02:18.380]   merging the meshing them together to make something.
[01:02:18.380 --> 01:02:23.380]   Between us, all of us, like probably are employing a lot of strategies that other people would find useful.
[01:02:23.380 --> 01:02:25.380]   It might be interesting to kind of collect those.
[01:02:25.380 --> 01:02:26.380]   Yeah, I think that's great.
[01:02:26.380 --> 01:02:27.380]   Well, we'll do some specials on those.
[01:02:27.380 --> 01:02:28.380]   Thanks, user.
[01:02:28.380 --> 01:02:29.380]   Yeah.
[01:02:29.380 --> 01:02:30.380]   Cool.
[01:02:30.380 --> 01:02:35.380]   I have a feeling that as we get closer to July 11th, there'll be less and less Mac news just because everybody's kind of
[01:02:35.380 --> 01:02:37.380]   holding their breath waiting for the iPhone to come out.
[01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:40.380]   And that maybe the next couple of weeks we could do something like that.
[01:02:40.380 --> 01:02:44.380]   I'd love it if you'd any time you want to come up here, Merlin, and we could do a couple
[01:02:44.380 --> 01:02:48.380]   hours at Twit Live just answering questions and talking in a less formal fashion.
[01:02:48.380 --> 01:02:49.380]   That would be fun too.
[01:02:49.380 --> 01:02:50.380]   Great idea.
[01:02:50.380 --> 01:02:51.380]   Really loved it.
[01:02:51.380 --> 01:02:54.380]   That's, I think that's what we need to do is respond to people's questions.
[01:02:54.380 --> 01:02:57.380]   Okay, Merlin's, like, now I want to know, well, how do you use Addium?
[01:02:57.380 --> 01:02:59.380]   That would be a really good thing.
[01:02:59.380 --> 01:03:00.380]   Yeah.
[01:03:00.380 --> 01:03:01.380]   Yeah, no, exactly.
[01:03:01.380 --> 01:03:04.380]   Addium's nice because it's open source and people write little plugins for it.
[01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:05.380]   I mean, it's, that's great.
[01:03:05.380 --> 01:03:08.380]   I understand why people use it, but Addium, which I don't have open right now.
[01:03:08.380 --> 01:03:09.380]   Oh, Addium.
[01:03:09.380 --> 01:03:10.380]   Don't open it now.
[01:03:10.380 --> 01:03:11.380]   You're bandwidth's already dying.
[01:03:11.380 --> 01:03:13.380]   You're getting your email or something.
[01:03:13.380 --> 01:03:14.380]   Don't open me.
[01:03:14.380 --> 01:03:15.380]   Yeah.
[01:03:15.380 --> 01:03:16.380]   Don't open anything else.
[01:03:16.380 --> 01:03:19.380]   There's a setting under here, privacy settings.
[01:03:19.380 --> 01:03:20.380]   We use Addium.
[01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:21.380]   Yes, I totally use it for that.
[01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:23.980]   For these accounts, make me available to these people.
[01:03:23.980 --> 01:03:27.380]   Like you could say like only a certain contact list group.
[01:03:27.380 --> 01:03:30.380]   So anyway, so you're still available, but you're not available to everybody.
[01:03:30.380 --> 01:03:33.380]   No, because I am as useless if you're available to everybody.
[01:03:33.380 --> 01:03:36.780]   Well, and there are some security settings in, in, in, uh, I chat.
[01:03:36.780 --> 01:03:39.380]   They're just not, they're just a little hard to do quickly.
[01:03:39.380 --> 01:03:40.980]   You just want to drag and drop on.
[01:03:40.980 --> 01:03:44.300]   I feel like we're, we're, we're talking to Apple here and I have to type stuff in.
[01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:48.540]   I just want to be able to drag stuff over and move it over and say, this is what I want.
[01:03:48.540 --> 01:03:49.740]   And it's not quite that easy.
[01:03:49.740 --> 01:03:50.740]   It's even like skyping.
[01:03:50.740 --> 01:03:52.860]   You're getting skyped and people are like, I want to talk.
[01:03:52.860 --> 01:03:56.260]   I'm going to talk like I'm actually kind of busy right now and the do not disturb means
[01:03:56.260 --> 01:03:57.820]   nothing to people.
[01:03:57.820 --> 01:03:59.060]   We're going to do open lines.
[01:03:59.060 --> 01:04:02.620]   Actually, after this show for those watching on Twit Live at about one o'clock, we'll do
[01:04:02.620 --> 01:04:03.620]   a 130.
[01:04:03.620 --> 01:04:06.980]   We'll do open lines for a little while before we get to floss weekly.
[01:04:06.980 --> 01:04:08.540]   That's the time to call in.
[01:04:08.540 --> 01:04:13.420]   Anybody who ever wants to come up here and have chocolate and wine and, and you've been
[01:04:13.420 --> 01:04:16.260]   up here, Justine, you've been up here at Alex Merlin.
[01:04:16.260 --> 01:04:17.260]   Yes.
[01:04:17.260 --> 01:04:18.260]   Love to get you over here.
[01:04:18.260 --> 01:04:19.260]   I don't, I don't drink, but I love chocolate.
[01:04:19.260 --> 01:04:22.100]   I'll get you chocolate chocolate and try tip sandwiches.
[01:04:22.100 --> 01:04:23.180]   We'll have beef.
[01:04:23.180 --> 01:04:28.340]   I have a little cart that we could put a blimp on and we'll have beef.
[01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:30.820]   Let's pause and then we're going to get our picks in just a little bit, but it's time
[01:04:30.820 --> 01:04:35.500]   to mention the great folks at audible.com who make this show possible.
[01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:41.860]   We have a special URL for those of you who are not yet members of Audible, audible.com/macbreak.
[01:04:41.860 --> 01:04:46.020]   By the way, when I met with them on Monday, the first thing I said is, all right, there's,
[01:04:46.020 --> 01:04:49.940]   you know, we want to get you new members, but what about the wonderful people who have
[01:04:49.940 --> 01:04:52.060]   listened to shows who have already joined?
[01:04:52.060 --> 01:04:56.380]   I want something for them and we're going to do some treats for existing Audible members
[01:04:56.380 --> 01:04:57.380]   too.
[01:04:57.380 --> 01:04:58.860]   That's something I know everybody would like some hat.
[01:04:58.860 --> 01:05:02.940]   Well, I think what I want to do is a half off book every week, but we'll tell you about
[01:05:02.940 --> 01:05:03.940]   that later.
[01:05:03.940 --> 01:05:04.940]   Well, this is your chance.
[01:05:04.940 --> 01:05:09.460]   If you're not a member, this is why you want to join go to audible.com/macbreak.
[01:05:09.460 --> 01:05:16.380]   Audible that has 50,000 books, radio shows, debates, meetings, speeches, all sorts of
[01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:18.060]   audio content heavy on the books.
[01:05:18.060 --> 01:05:21.460]   Of course, they've they've added a ton of science fiction lately.
[01:05:21.460 --> 01:05:24.900]   It is a great place to get your reading done.
[01:05:24.900 --> 01:05:27.220]   And Andy, if you don't have a pick, I have a pick.
[01:05:27.220 --> 01:05:28.220]   It's up to you.
[01:05:28.220 --> 01:05:29.220]   I didn't ask you ahead of time.
[01:05:29.220 --> 01:05:34.980]   Well, I have a pick on a book that I just started listening to yesterday's, but I guess
[01:05:34.980 --> 01:05:36.460]   I'm guessing yours is going to be better.
[01:05:36.460 --> 01:05:38.060]   So why don't you go?
[01:05:38.060 --> 01:05:44.900]   My book is called Things I've Learned from Women Who Have Dumped Me.
[01:05:44.900 --> 01:05:48.540]   And that was that was that was actually on my short list this week, by the way.
[01:05:48.540 --> 01:05:49.540]   Doesn't that look good?
[01:05:49.540 --> 01:05:50.540]   I own the book.
[01:05:50.540 --> 01:05:51.540]   I've read the book.
[01:05:51.540 --> 01:05:52.540]   I like the book.
[01:05:52.540 --> 01:05:53.540]   Go ahead.
[01:05:53.540 --> 01:05:56.180]   It's the former executive producer of the Daily Show and the Colbert Report.
[01:05:56.180 --> 01:06:01.900]   This together, Ben Carlin, and it has some, you know, Andy Richter, Dan Savage, Steven
[01:06:01.900 --> 01:06:06.300]   Colbert's in it, Nick Hornby, who let me play a little bit of this just so you can hear
[01:06:06.300 --> 01:06:07.300]   here.
[01:06:07.300 --> 01:06:08.300]   You know, I never know.
[01:06:08.300 --> 01:06:11.780]   And I had another thing I said, guys, you got to give me excerpts that are the best part.
[01:06:11.780 --> 01:06:16.060]   So in my role as a British citizen and someone who has studiously learned nothing from the
[01:06:16.060 --> 01:06:21.220]   trail of failed relationships behind me, it is an honor and a contractual obligation to
[01:06:21.220 --> 01:06:26.860]   read Nick Hornby's introduction to you now, due to his inability or unwillingness to bother
[01:06:26.860 --> 01:06:30.340]   to turn up and read it himself.
[01:06:30.340 --> 01:06:31.340]   I love Nick Hornby, by the way.
[01:06:31.340 --> 01:06:35.380]   At the time of writing, I've been happily married for 13 months to a woman.
[01:06:35.380 --> 01:06:41.580]   He's a guy I wrote about a boy and all the way down and he's just great.
[01:06:41.580 --> 01:06:42.580]   What was that?
[01:06:42.580 --> 01:06:43.580]   The one that they made them?
[01:06:43.580 --> 01:06:44.580]   A fidelity.
[01:06:44.580 --> 01:06:45.580]   High fidelity.
[01:06:45.580 --> 01:06:47.220]   I love that movie, but he's the books even better.
[01:06:47.220 --> 01:06:50.860]   I've been listening with eight years, thanks to the audiobook you're currently listening
[01:06:50.860 --> 01:06:54.180]   to, the implications of this are now clear to me.
[01:06:54.180 --> 01:06:58.860]   Not only have I learned nothing whatsoever for the best part of a decade, but also the
[01:06:58.860 --> 01:07:02.580]   things I did learn are beginning to fade disastrously from the mind.
[01:07:02.580 --> 01:07:07.540]   If you want relationship advice from some of the most, the funniest and yet saddest in
[01:07:07.540 --> 01:07:11.700]   some ways people, men on the face of the earth, things I've learned from the women who've
[01:07:11.700 --> 01:07:15.380]   dumped me, that could be nice.
[01:07:15.380 --> 01:07:17.620]   I think even Justine should listen to this.
[01:07:17.620 --> 01:07:18.820]   It sounds pretty entertaining.
[01:07:18.820 --> 01:07:22.660]   I think you would learn how to dump, which is always a good thing to do.
[01:07:22.660 --> 01:07:23.660]   Not through email.
[01:07:23.660 --> 01:07:24.660]   I hear that's not a good thing to do.
[01:07:24.660 --> 01:07:25.660]   Email text, not good.
[01:07:25.660 --> 01:07:26.660]   Who was it?
[01:07:26.660 --> 01:07:30.100]   Was it Kevin Federline who got dumped by text, Brittany?
[01:07:30.100 --> 01:07:32.300]   Yeah, and someone shot video of him doing it.
[01:07:32.300 --> 01:07:33.300]   He was on TV.
[01:07:33.300 --> 01:07:37.140]   He got the message on TV was on a much music in Canada, in Toronto.
[01:07:37.140 --> 01:07:42.340]   He was on the TV show and the video of his face falling as he sees this text message from
[01:07:42.340 --> 01:07:45.140]   Brittany saying, "You're out of here, dude."
[01:07:45.140 --> 01:07:46.140]   It's cold.
[01:07:46.140 --> 01:07:47.140]   It's really cold.
[01:07:47.140 --> 01:07:49.140]   It's just, you know, Web2L.
[01:07:49.140 --> 01:07:50.140]   It's how we...
[01:07:50.140 --> 01:07:53.140]   Come on, Justine, have you ever broken up with a guy in text message?
[01:07:53.140 --> 01:07:54.140]   She has.
[01:07:54.140 --> 01:07:55.140]   I know she has.
[01:07:55.140 --> 01:07:57.380]   I can tell, listening to it.
[01:07:57.380 --> 01:07:58.380]   I know you have.
[01:07:58.380 --> 01:07:59.380]   Moving on.
[01:07:59.380 --> 01:08:04.860]   Things we've just learned from women who have dumped me.
[01:08:04.860 --> 01:08:06.420]   It is our pick of the week.
[01:08:06.420 --> 01:08:07.420]   Here's how you do it.
[01:08:07.420 --> 01:08:11.860]   You go to audible.com/macbreak, you sign up, you get a credit tour to free book, it could
[01:08:11.860 --> 01:08:14.460]   be this or any of the 50,000 other titles.
[01:08:14.460 --> 01:08:18.180]   Hey, after a couple of weeks, if you feel like, "I don't know if this is for me," you
[01:08:18.180 --> 01:08:19.180]   can cancel.
[01:08:19.180 --> 01:08:20.740]   No cost, no obligation to you.
[01:08:20.740 --> 01:08:22.340]   But let me tell you something.
[01:08:22.340 --> 01:08:23.900]   I know you're going to want to listen to this.
[01:08:23.900 --> 01:08:25.340]   Now I know audiobooks aren't for everybody.
[01:08:25.340 --> 01:08:29.900]   There's some people who just really still like to hold up a paper book and this doesn't
[01:08:29.900 --> 01:08:33.980]   eliminate it, but there's just times when you want to learn, when your mind is ready,
[01:08:33.980 --> 01:08:38.980]   but your eyes are busy doing other things like driving, working out, gardening, cleaning
[01:08:38.980 --> 01:08:39.980]   house.
[01:08:39.980 --> 01:08:41.420]   I don't get to drive as much as I used to.
[01:08:41.420 --> 01:08:46.940]   So I do a lot of audible walking to work while I'm doing boring stuff like the treadmill.
[01:08:46.940 --> 01:08:47.940]   I love Audible.
[01:08:47.940 --> 01:08:49.740]   Audible.com/macbreak.
[01:08:49.740 --> 01:08:51.420]   Thank them so much for their support.
[01:08:51.420 --> 01:08:55.380]   The way you can do it is by signing up today.
[01:08:55.380 --> 01:08:57.780]   I'll let you know about the iPhone thing that they're going to do.
[01:08:57.780 --> 01:08:58.780]   That's going to be fun.
[01:08:58.780 --> 01:09:00.740]   All right, time for our picks, Justine.
[01:09:00.740 --> 01:09:02.900]   I'm going to start ladies first with you.
[01:09:02.900 --> 01:09:04.780]   You got a good pick for us.
[01:09:04.780 --> 01:09:05.780]   Right.
[01:09:05.780 --> 01:09:06.780]   Kind of.
[01:09:06.780 --> 01:09:09.020]   It's actually a really fun website that I just found today.
[01:09:09.020 --> 01:09:16.300]   It's called Camaroid and it uses your webcam and you can use all these really interesting
[01:09:16.300 --> 01:09:17.300]   effects.
[01:09:17.300 --> 01:09:25.460]   It's C-A-M-E-R-O-I-D and you can save them, download them and just use your eyesight.
[01:09:25.460 --> 01:09:30.580]   But so it's kind of like a photo booth but without with the web or?
[01:09:30.580 --> 01:09:34.020]   Yes, and I love websites that have simple sign up.
[01:09:34.020 --> 01:09:36.380]   All I had to do was enter my email address and I was logged in.
[01:09:36.380 --> 01:09:37.380]   Yeah, that's much better.
[01:09:37.380 --> 01:09:39.460]   Yeah.
[01:09:39.460 --> 01:09:42.780]   And are there any wacky pictures of Justine on the Camaroid?
[01:09:42.780 --> 01:09:45.140]   I just started taking some, yeah.
[01:09:45.140 --> 01:09:47.060]   Can we search for them?
[01:09:47.060 --> 01:09:49.740]   You can, they should just show up on the main page, I believe.
[01:09:49.740 --> 01:09:50.740]   Oh boy.
[01:09:50.740 --> 01:09:51.740]   Oh boy.
[01:09:51.740 --> 01:09:53.740]   It's time scans, good times.
[01:09:53.740 --> 01:09:54.740]   C-A-M-E-R-O-I-D.com.
[01:09:54.740 --> 01:09:55.740]   That.
[01:09:55.740 --> 01:09:58.740]   I'm going to actually mention something.
[01:09:58.740 --> 01:10:03.220]   I think we've ever mentioned before but you gave me the idea, Merlin Man, because we're
[01:10:03.220 --> 01:10:08.940]   going to try, this is how Merlin and Lonely Sandwich and Scott do, You Look Nice Today,
[01:10:08.940 --> 01:10:13.580]   which is their fantastic, wonderful, funniest podcast I've ever heard.
[01:10:13.580 --> 01:10:15.820]   You look nice today.com.
[01:10:15.820 --> 01:10:18.580]   You want to know how it sounds so good?
[01:10:18.580 --> 01:10:20.740]   They record locally.
[01:10:20.740 --> 01:10:21.740]   Can I tell this?
[01:10:21.740 --> 01:10:22.740]   Merlin, I was just giving away a secret.
[01:10:22.740 --> 01:10:23.740]   No, it's not double-ending, Leo.
[01:10:23.740 --> 01:10:24.740]   It's not double-ending.
[01:10:24.740 --> 01:10:25.740]   Double-ending, man.
[01:10:25.740 --> 01:10:27.740]   He's so in with it in the hip.
[01:10:27.740 --> 01:10:29.340]   Oh yeah, we do a double-ending.
[01:10:29.340 --> 01:10:31.500]   I just learned that term like a couple of weeks.
[01:10:31.500 --> 01:10:36.740]   So what you do is you do what we're doing right now, which is a Skype call, but you each individually
[01:10:36.740 --> 01:10:42.580]   record your own audio and then you then then sandwich edits it all together into a show.
[01:10:42.580 --> 01:10:45.380]   Yeah, you can think of Skype as being a monitor, basically.
[01:10:45.380 --> 01:10:48.260]   But what happens as a result is your show always sounds like you're all together.
[01:10:48.260 --> 01:10:51.540]   I mean, sounds so, except the first one, where, where, sandwich is like across the room.
[01:10:51.540 --> 01:10:52.540]   He didn't, I don't know.
[01:10:52.540 --> 01:10:54.980]   I think he was talking in, I think he was talking into a MacBook, I'm not sure.
[01:10:54.980 --> 01:10:56.180]   He was not into it.
[01:10:56.180 --> 01:10:58.540]   He was talking at it from a distance.
[01:10:58.540 --> 01:11:00.500]   It sounded like he was over here.
[01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:03.060]   Anyway, you use call recorder, right?
[01:11:03.060 --> 01:11:05.020]   Yeah, the E-cam, said what's called.
[01:11:05.020 --> 01:11:06.340]   Yep, E-cam's call recorder.
[01:11:06.340 --> 01:11:07.700]   And I actually have been using this.
[01:11:07.700 --> 01:11:11.020]   I always use it as a way to back up.
[01:11:11.020 --> 01:11:14.380]   But now I'm thinking maybe this is how we should do Mac break weekly, since you're all
[01:11:14.380 --> 01:11:16.860]   using Macs.
[01:11:16.860 --> 01:11:20.540]   And he's finally giving up on the Asus, right?
[01:11:20.540 --> 01:11:25.860]   Again, until I take it out back, dunk it in kerosene, set it on fire and find new one,
[01:11:25.860 --> 01:11:30.540]   which is the only way to properly troubleshoot any open source base machine.
[01:11:30.540 --> 01:11:31.540]   Yeah, it's not working.
[01:11:31.540 --> 01:11:32.540]   It's not working.
[01:11:32.540 --> 01:11:36.500]   And it's decided that, you know, three months was a long time for an open source computer
[01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:37.500]   to keep working.
[01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:39.220]   Oh, you're going to get something.
[01:11:39.220 --> 01:11:41.460]   You better get those filters going there, boy.
[01:11:41.460 --> 01:11:42.940]   You're going to get some email.
[01:11:42.940 --> 01:11:43.940]   I'll do that.
[01:11:43.940 --> 01:11:44.940]   That's easy.
[01:11:44.940 --> 01:11:45.940]   I'll just set up.
[01:11:45.940 --> 01:11:49.540]   If the send client is E-max, just put it right into the, into the, into the, into the
[01:11:49.540 --> 01:11:50.540]   trash file.
[01:11:50.540 --> 01:11:52.580]   That's a good idea.
[01:11:52.580 --> 01:11:53.580]   Use your agent, E-max.
[01:11:53.580 --> 01:11:54.580]   Bye-bye.
[01:11:54.580 --> 01:11:57.360]   This, this message written in Lisp.
[01:11:57.360 --> 01:11:59.900]   So a call recorder is, you could try it for free.
[01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:00.900]   And I, I recommend it.
[01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:02.260]   It's only $15 to buy.
[01:12:02.260 --> 01:12:06.460]   And it, what's great, really, it's very easy to use because it is, once you install it,
[01:12:06.460 --> 01:12:08.780]   it just automatically opens when you open Skype.
[01:12:08.780 --> 01:12:10.220]   You can even set it to automatically record.
[01:12:10.220 --> 01:12:11.900]   So you don't even have to think about it.
[01:12:11.900 --> 01:12:16.460]   It gives you a variety of different formats to record into compressed and uncompressed.
[01:12:16.460 --> 01:12:18.260]   The quality is excellent.
[01:12:18.260 --> 01:12:20.820]   And people have asked me for a long time, how do you get both ends?
[01:12:20.820 --> 01:12:25.140]   This records the whole conversation, your side and your caller's side.
[01:12:25.140 --> 01:12:28.540]   So great for just saving stuff, great for recording podcasts.
[01:12:28.540 --> 01:12:32.420]   If you're in litigation, your wife's leaving you, maybe she dumped you and you want recording
[01:12:32.420 --> 01:12:35.340]   of that conversation, this is the way to do it.
[01:12:35.340 --> 01:12:36.500]   Yeah, but what?
[01:12:36.500 --> 01:12:39.820]   You remember to tell her that you're recording it.
[01:12:39.820 --> 01:12:40.820]   Yeah.
[01:12:40.820 --> 01:12:42.580]   Well, it depends on the state.
[01:12:42.580 --> 01:12:44.660]   Some states, I think it's, I think it's extra off.
[01:12:44.660 --> 01:12:45.660]   I think it's a federal thing.
[01:12:45.660 --> 01:12:48.180]   I think that, Lynette Tripp, remember to travel.
[01:12:48.180 --> 01:12:49.180]   Yeah.
[01:12:49.180 --> 01:12:51.380]   Yes, she did it in one state where it was legal.
[01:12:51.380 --> 01:12:52.380]   Okay.
[01:12:52.380 --> 01:12:54.180]   That's how you do it.
[01:12:54.180 --> 01:12:56.820]   It's not in every state.
[01:12:56.820 --> 01:13:00.340]   You have to check your local laws, ladies and gentlemen, about recording people without
[01:13:00.340 --> 01:13:01.340]   their knowledge.
[01:13:01.340 --> 01:13:05.620]   But if you're doing a podcast, I think they're probably expecting to get recorded.
[01:13:05.620 --> 01:13:10.020]   ECA, double M.com, they do a number of really good programs.
[01:13:10.020 --> 01:13:15.300]   I really like E-Cam, including a USB driver for cameras that in theory don't work with
[01:13:15.300 --> 01:13:16.300]   a Mac.
[01:13:16.300 --> 01:13:19.340]   I think it's all recorders, the program, and I hope it instilled your Thunder Merlin,
[01:13:19.340 --> 01:13:22.580]   but you reminded me what a great program this is, and I've been using it for a long
[01:13:22.580 --> 01:13:23.580]   time.
[01:13:23.580 --> 01:13:28.380]   Yeah, it's, if it's something where, I appreciate you saying that about the show, it's something
[01:13:28.380 --> 01:13:33.060]   where, I mean, I think if you wanted to sound like something that you would hear on the
[01:13:33.060 --> 01:13:35.500]   radio, it's something you kind of got to do.
[01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:38.660]   Just as Alex Slinsey will tell you, Skype can be very independent.
[01:13:38.660 --> 01:13:39.660]   Right.
[01:13:39.660 --> 01:13:40.660]   And it's not, it's not perfect.
[01:13:40.660 --> 01:13:42.380]   It's not perfect every time.
[01:13:42.380 --> 01:13:46.020]   And I think for very large groups of recording, it's still going to be hard because you,
[01:13:46.020 --> 01:13:48.780]   it's almost like trying to get a photo with 100 people where no one's blinking.
[01:13:48.780 --> 01:13:49.940]   It's like statistically possible.
[01:13:49.940 --> 01:13:53.300]   Like the more people you go to the call, the more likely that somebody forgot to record
[01:13:53.300 --> 01:13:54.780]   or that it'll be messed up.
[01:13:54.780 --> 01:13:57.580]   But yeah, I think it's very, the quality is great.
[01:13:57.580 --> 01:13:58.740]   It also records video, right?
[01:13:58.740 --> 01:14:00.740]   I haven't used that, but I think it records video as well.
[01:14:00.740 --> 01:14:01.740]   Same deal.
[01:14:01.740 --> 01:14:02.740]   You can also, yeah, exactly.
[01:14:02.740 --> 01:14:03.740]   And what is it?
[01:14:03.740 --> 01:14:05.580]   There's something cool that you can do with that.
[01:14:05.580 --> 01:14:06.580]   You have record video.
[01:14:06.580 --> 01:14:10.540]   You can have different people half and half like on the screen.
[01:14:10.540 --> 01:14:11.540]   I find stuff.
[01:14:11.540 --> 01:14:12.540]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:14:12.540 --> 01:14:13.540]   It's pretty neat.
[01:14:13.540 --> 01:14:15.420]   I must say they do a great job.
[01:14:15.420 --> 01:14:18.420]   And very reliable and it hasn't caused any problems with my Skype.
[01:14:18.420 --> 01:14:19.420]   So I highly recommend it.
[01:14:19.420 --> 01:14:24.580]   It's Ecamm, Mac only, of course, ECAMM.com's call recorder.
[01:14:24.580 --> 01:14:26.300]   That's my pick of the week.
[01:14:26.300 --> 01:14:27.780]   Merlin, you got one for us?
[01:14:27.780 --> 01:14:29.700]   Yeah, you know, I'm so lame.
[01:14:29.700 --> 01:14:32.860]   I'm always like talking about the same stuff over and over, but there's something momentous
[01:14:32.860 --> 01:14:36.780]   happened this week with an application that we've talked about before that I am starting
[01:14:36.780 --> 01:14:39.420]   to really like.
[01:14:39.420 --> 01:14:40.420]   And that's Evernote.
[01:14:40.420 --> 01:14:45.380]   Oh, now, now, give me credit for this because you were skeptical when I said, "I'm going
[01:14:45.380 --> 01:14:46.380]   to say it was a good thing."
[01:14:46.380 --> 01:14:49.700]   Well, I'm in the business, Leo, or if you can call it a business of being skeptical
[01:14:49.700 --> 01:14:51.980]   about this stuff because there's a lot of tools out there.
[01:14:51.980 --> 01:14:52.980]   Yeah.
[01:14:52.980 --> 01:14:57.460]   And I mean, and I think there's a big difference between making best use of the technology
[01:14:57.460 --> 01:15:00.500]   and figuring out something that's actually useful to people.
[01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:04.620]   Also, in fairness, Evernote didn't used to have quite such a cool web app and quite
[01:15:04.620 --> 01:15:05.620]   - Oh, no.
[01:15:05.620 --> 01:15:07.820]   - didn't have any OS 10 app.
[01:15:07.820 --> 01:15:09.660]   But just to quickly review, Evernote's an app.
[01:15:09.660 --> 01:15:13.620]   It's a functionality that lives out there, I think, mostly in the cloud.
[01:15:13.620 --> 01:15:15.340]   And you send stuff to it.
[01:15:15.340 --> 01:15:19.940]   You type notes, or you send photos, you do whatever, and you can send stuff from a web
[01:15:19.940 --> 01:15:22.140]   page, you can paste stuff in.
[01:15:22.140 --> 01:15:24.500]   It's kind of hard to explain without using it, but it's a little bit like Devin think
[01:15:24.500 --> 01:15:27.940]   if you ever use something like Devin think on the Mac or maybe a little bit like the
[01:15:27.940 --> 01:15:32.340]   Yajimbo, which is just throw stuff at it and it automatically syncs everything.
[01:15:32.340 --> 01:15:37.340]   So I can sit there and I can throw a whole bunch of things I want to read, for example,
[01:15:37.340 --> 01:15:39.420]   into Evernote and take it on a plane.
[01:15:39.420 --> 01:15:40.420]   I can tag it.
[01:15:40.420 --> 01:15:41.420]   I can read it.
[01:15:41.420 --> 01:15:42.420]   I can move stuff around.
[01:15:42.420 --> 01:15:45.060]   It's just all this, just anyway, it's just a fantastic application.
[01:15:45.060 --> 01:15:51.020]   So the thing I think that's the real sexy is that if you send it a photo and it can detect
[01:15:51.020 --> 01:15:57.460]   any text in the photo, it will do basic OCR such that you can find that photo again based
[01:15:57.460 --> 01:15:59.820]   on searching for text in the photo.
[01:15:59.820 --> 01:16:03.620]   So you can like, you know, the bummer is it doesn't turn into a text file or a PDF as
[01:16:03.620 --> 01:16:07.340]   a result of that, which I think we kind of surprised if it didn't eventually do, but
[01:16:07.340 --> 01:16:09.340]   it's really cool.
[01:16:09.340 --> 01:16:11.460]   And they just went, they just did a couple of things.
[01:16:11.460 --> 01:16:14.220]   First of all, it's no longer a private beta.
[01:16:14.220 --> 01:16:17.020]   You can now sign up at Evernote.
[01:16:17.020 --> 01:16:19.180]   And they've also redone the web app.
[01:16:19.180 --> 01:16:22.340]   And it's really pretty and fun to use.
[01:16:22.340 --> 01:16:25.500]   And I'm trying to right now as I'm kind of screwing around here, I wanted to show you
[01:16:25.500 --> 01:16:29.060]   I've just posted some stuff public where you guys could go and people could go and see
[01:16:29.060 --> 01:16:30.060]   what it looks like.
[01:16:30.060 --> 01:16:31.060]   So how would they do that?
[01:16:31.060 --> 01:16:32.860]   Let me go look at it.
[01:16:32.860 --> 01:16:35.860]   Evernote.com/merlin or something like that.
[01:16:35.860 --> 01:16:36.860]   Selfless in post.
[01:16:36.860 --> 01:16:40.100]   I mean, I mean, Evernote.
[01:16:40.100 --> 01:16:44.900]   I used on Windows for a long time as kind of a substitution for Microsoft's OneNote, which
[01:16:44.900 --> 01:16:47.900]   is arguably a better program on Windows.
[01:16:47.900 --> 01:16:49.140]   But I really liked Evernote.
[01:16:49.140 --> 01:16:50.140]   I liked its model.
[01:16:50.140 --> 01:16:53.580]   And when they came out with this cloud-based version, so they have Windows clients, Mac
[01:16:53.580 --> 01:16:57.260]   OS X clients, you can even look it on your iPhone and smartphones.
[01:16:57.260 --> 01:16:58.940]   It lives both on your computer.
[01:16:58.940 --> 01:16:59.940]   It sinks.
[01:16:59.940 --> 01:17:00.940]   So it lives on your computer.
[01:17:00.940 --> 01:17:01.940]   It sinks with the cloud.
[01:17:01.940 --> 01:17:03.340]   So you can go to it on the web as well.
[01:17:03.340 --> 01:17:05.620]   I'm glad they finally went public because I just think this is.
[01:17:05.620 --> 01:17:06.620]   Yeah.
[01:17:06.620 --> 01:17:07.620]   And it's free.
[01:17:07.620 --> 01:17:08.620]   That's a great app.
[01:17:08.620 --> 01:17:11.620]   I'll send you guys right now through the little tube that connects us.
[01:17:11.620 --> 01:17:14.500]   I'll send you a URL and I'll read it out to everybody else if you want to look.
[01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:21.780]   If you go to Evernote.com/pub/merlinman/merlinman.
[01:17:21.780 --> 01:17:23.020]   That's a terrible rule.
[01:17:23.020 --> 01:17:26.820]   You'll land on my public page where you can see stuff that I've thrown up, including
[01:17:26.820 --> 01:17:29.260]   you can see where you can go and win and you can make a thing.
[01:17:29.260 --> 01:17:30.260]   Oh, that's cool.
[01:17:30.260 --> 01:17:31.260]   Look at that.
[01:17:31.260 --> 01:17:32.260]   Do list items.
[01:17:32.260 --> 01:17:33.260]   Actually, let me go fix that to you.
[01:17:33.260 --> 01:17:34.260]   I screwed that up.
[01:17:34.260 --> 01:17:35.260]   But if I re-sync.
[01:17:35.260 --> 01:17:39.500]   So anytime you sync, it goes and it does all the OCR on your photos and stuff.
[01:17:39.500 --> 01:17:40.500]   And if you go--
[01:17:40.500 --> 01:17:41.500]   So you're doing this not on the web.
[01:17:41.500 --> 01:17:42.500]   You could do this locally.
[01:17:42.500 --> 01:17:45.340]   I'm doing this on a desktop app and syncing.
[01:17:45.340 --> 01:17:48.500]   Now, I can also go in and say on that high Mac break weekly, people think you just saw
[01:17:48.500 --> 01:17:54.820]   I could say I could tag that Leo Laport and tag that.
[01:17:54.820 --> 01:17:56.060]   Evernote.
[01:17:56.060 --> 01:17:59.260]   And all of that stuff can be exposed through searches that you can save.
[01:17:59.260 --> 01:18:00.980]   It sinks right away too.
[01:18:00.980 --> 01:18:01.980]   It's very fast.
[01:18:01.980 --> 01:18:06.980]   Yeah.
[01:18:06.980 --> 01:18:09.260]   And if you reload, you should see some tags.
[01:18:09.260 --> 01:18:10.820]   Now, it's getting slow.
[01:18:10.820 --> 01:18:11.820]   But anyway, it's pretty bad.
[01:18:11.820 --> 01:18:12.820]   I like it a lot.
[01:18:12.820 --> 01:18:15.300]   And like I said, I'm really glad that it's something that finally people can use.
[01:18:15.300 --> 01:18:17.380]   And again, it's part of this along the trends.
[01:18:17.380 --> 01:18:18.580]   I just don't want to just clarify.
[01:18:18.580 --> 01:18:21.940]   So if you send a photo to Flickr, you could also send it to Evernote.
[01:18:21.940 --> 01:18:25.860]   You could do stuff like it could send stuff from Jot into Evernote.
[01:18:25.860 --> 01:18:27.500]   It also does audio.
[01:18:27.500 --> 01:18:29.660]   So anyway, there's all kinds of sexy here.
[01:18:29.660 --> 01:18:32.420]   And I think it's a really promising application.
[01:18:32.420 --> 01:18:33.420]   And I'll be interesting.
[01:18:33.420 --> 01:18:37.300]   Oh, and then finally, finally, you can now buy for $5 a month.
[01:18:37.300 --> 01:18:39.060]   I think you can buy extra space, which I did.
[01:18:39.060 --> 01:18:42.420]   500 megabytes for-- yeah, or 45 bucks a year.
[01:18:42.420 --> 01:18:43.540]   So it's a big week for them.
[01:18:43.540 --> 01:18:44.540]   At least check it out.
[01:18:44.540 --> 01:18:46.940]   I think it's really impressive.
[01:18:46.940 --> 01:18:48.380]   It's not perfect, but none of these things are.
[01:18:48.380 --> 01:18:49.620]   It's very flexible.
[01:18:49.620 --> 01:18:50.460]   There's a lot to it.
[01:18:50.460 --> 01:18:53.300]   And if you live in lots of different places and don't want to have to think about this
[01:18:53.300 --> 01:18:57.380]   stuff too much, I think it's actually a really useful application.
[01:18:57.380 --> 01:19:00.980]   I've been using it since the early beta since I talked about it before.
[01:19:00.980 --> 01:19:02.660]   And it's gotten better and better.
[01:19:02.660 --> 01:19:03.980]   And they've been very responsive.
[01:19:03.980 --> 01:19:05.140]   I've actually corresponded with them.
[01:19:05.140 --> 01:19:07.580]   And I said, guys, you got to support PDF.
[01:19:07.580 --> 01:19:08.020]   They did.
[01:19:08.020 --> 01:19:09.140]   You got to support encryption.
[01:19:09.140 --> 01:19:10.100]   They did.
[01:19:10.100 --> 01:19:12.580]   I am-- actually, by the looks of those tags, I've updated.
[01:19:12.580 --> 01:19:15.100]   Now, my request for them--
[01:19:15.100 --> 01:19:16.460]   there's no easy way to do this right now.
[01:19:16.460 --> 01:19:20.620]   My request is to have some kind of an import robot for bringing in all my delicious bookmarks.
[01:19:20.620 --> 01:19:23.700]   Because I'd love for this to start being where I start writing and writing stuff.
[01:19:23.700 --> 01:19:24.820]   Where I can bookmark stuff.
[01:19:24.820 --> 01:19:27.220]   But it captures stuff like tags and a URL.
[01:19:27.220 --> 01:19:29.020]   And then I can write the whole post right in here.
[01:19:29.020 --> 01:19:29.540]   Oh, yeah.
[01:19:29.540 --> 01:19:30.540]   I see the tags.
[01:19:30.540 --> 01:19:31.540]   That's cool.
[01:19:31.540 --> 01:19:32.540]   That's really neat.
[01:19:32.540 --> 01:19:33.740]   It does have a bookmark.
[01:19:33.740 --> 01:19:35.500]   You can't-- does have a share this capability.
[01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:36.500]   So you can go the other way.
[01:19:36.500 --> 01:19:37.500]   You can share it with the Google--
[01:19:37.500 --> 01:19:38.980]   And you have to imagine.
[01:19:38.980 --> 01:19:41.580]   I mean, given-- you get some kind of a system that works.
[01:19:41.580 --> 01:19:43.980]   And the first question people ask is, how do I get my whole team on this?
[01:19:43.980 --> 01:19:47.020]   So you have to wonder at some point if they're going to introduce sharing--
[01:19:47.020 --> 01:19:48.940]   Well, that's the other thing that's very interesting.
[01:19:48.940 --> 01:19:51.180]   I think there's a huge revenue opportunity for them.
[01:19:51.180 --> 01:19:52.860]   They're smart to give away the basic.
[01:19:52.860 --> 01:19:56.500]   But don't you think business is going to absolutely want to--
[01:19:56.500 --> 01:19:57.740]   I'll totally do that.
[01:19:57.740 --> 01:19:58.540]   Yeah, and pay for it.
[01:19:58.540 --> 01:20:01.540]   And I'd be totally willing to pay for this from my work group to be able to--
[01:20:01.540 --> 01:20:06.500]   This is a base camp from 37 signals, but even better, I think.
[01:20:06.500 --> 01:20:07.500]   I'd say similar.
[01:20:07.500 --> 01:20:08.500]   It's kind of like backpack maybe.
[01:20:08.500 --> 01:20:09.500]   Backpack.
[01:20:09.500 --> 01:20:10.020]   That's a better.
[01:20:10.020 --> 01:20:11.020]   Yeah.
[01:20:11.020 --> 01:20:12.020]   Yeah.
[01:20:12.020 --> 01:20:13.020]   Good pick.
[01:20:13.020 --> 01:20:14.020]   Ever note--
[01:20:14.020 --> 01:20:15.020]   Ever note.com.
[01:20:15.020 --> 01:20:16.380]   I'll try to never mention it again.
[01:20:16.380 --> 01:20:17.380]   Sorry to keep bringing them up.
[01:20:17.380 --> 01:20:18.380]   No.
[01:20:18.380 --> 01:20:19.380]   I think it's worth it.
[01:20:19.380 --> 01:20:20.380]   I think this is--
[01:20:20.380 --> 01:20:22.820]   What do you use it for, Justine?
[01:20:22.820 --> 01:20:24.700]   I'm going to take a lot of photos.
[01:20:24.700 --> 01:20:29.260]   I mean, most of mine are private, but it's stuff that I just search for and it will recognize
[01:20:29.260 --> 01:20:31.700]   the text in the photo, which is awesome.
[01:20:31.700 --> 01:20:32.700]   Yeah.
[01:20:32.700 --> 01:20:37.820]   I did a recent brainstorming session, and I sent all the photos of the whiteboard to
[01:20:37.820 --> 01:20:38.820]   scrap my iPhone.
[01:20:38.820 --> 01:20:40.420]   And I was able to go in.
[01:20:40.420 --> 01:20:44.580]   And again, it would be really super cool if it was like a scan snap where it OCR them
[01:20:44.580 --> 01:20:46.260]   as well into full text.
[01:20:46.260 --> 01:20:49.260]   But it's great to be able to go and find those notes in a pile.
[01:20:49.260 --> 01:20:51.580]   And I think one of the things is a very GTD concept.
[01:20:51.580 --> 01:20:54.780]   But this idea that once you get really good at collecting information, it's easy to feel
[01:20:54.780 --> 01:20:55.980]   buried by it.
[01:20:55.980 --> 01:20:58.940]   And there's so many affordances for lightweight organization of this stuff.
[01:20:58.940 --> 01:21:03.780]   Like show me just images that I uploaded in the last day that aren't tagged or whatever.
[01:21:03.780 --> 01:21:06.580]   And so there's all kinds of ways to expose this stuff that's--
[01:21:06.580 --> 01:21:07.820]   Do you use Jot?
[01:21:07.820 --> 01:21:10.940]   I would love it if I could Jot to ever note.
[01:21:10.940 --> 01:21:11.940]   I think you can.
[01:21:11.940 --> 01:21:12.940]   I mean, Jot's added a whole bunch of stuff.
[01:21:12.940 --> 01:21:14.300]   I wish I could Jot to Omni Focus.
[01:21:14.300 --> 01:21:15.300]   That's my big thing.
[01:21:15.300 --> 01:21:16.300]   But I love Jot.
[01:21:16.300 --> 01:21:18.300]   I use it all the time.
[01:21:18.300 --> 01:21:23.180]   It was time this morning because I was a Jot to remember the milk, which is my to-do list.
[01:21:23.180 --> 01:21:28.500]   And it takes me 18 seconds to put a new to-do item on there from start to finish using
[01:21:28.500 --> 01:21:29.500]   the cell phone.
[01:21:29.500 --> 01:21:30.900]   So I press the auto dial for Jot.
[01:21:30.900 --> 01:21:32.500]   It says, who do you want to Jot?
[01:21:32.500 --> 01:21:33.500]   I say, remember the milk.
[01:21:33.500 --> 01:21:34.980]   I say, remember the milk.
[01:21:34.980 --> 01:21:35.980]   Sure.
[01:21:35.980 --> 01:21:36.980]   And it says, remember the milk?
[01:21:36.980 --> 01:21:37.980]   And I say, yes.
[01:21:37.980 --> 01:21:38.980]   Beep.
[01:21:38.980 --> 01:21:41.060]   Remember to call Merlin.
[01:21:41.060 --> 01:21:42.060]   And then I hang up.
[01:21:42.060 --> 01:21:43.060]   And it's in my, remember them.
[01:21:43.060 --> 01:21:44.060]   It's kind of remarkable.
[01:21:44.060 --> 01:21:45.060]   You know--
[01:21:45.060 --> 01:21:46.260]   I wish they had a power user mode.
[01:21:46.260 --> 01:21:48.580]   I wish there was one where it would just beep, beep, click, beep.
[01:21:48.580 --> 01:21:49.580]   I don't want to say yes.
[01:21:49.580 --> 01:21:50.580]   Yeah.
[01:21:50.580 --> 01:21:51.580]   Five things.
[01:21:51.580 --> 01:21:52.580]   And it would just send.
[01:21:52.580 --> 01:21:53.580]   There might be.
[01:21:53.580 --> 01:21:56.380]   I think that's one of the-- hey, we just added another pick, JOTT.com.
[01:21:56.380 --> 01:21:57.380]   That's also a free service.
[01:21:57.380 --> 01:21:58.380]   And--
[01:21:58.380 --> 01:22:03.100]   So you call a phone number and people on the Indian subcontinent basically turn the thing
[01:22:03.100 --> 01:22:05.820]   that you said with your voice into words and send it someplace.
[01:22:05.820 --> 01:22:08.020]   You know, somebody should write a novel.
[01:22:08.020 --> 01:22:09.020]   I think Nicholson--
[01:22:09.020 --> 01:22:10.020]   I should clarify, though.
[01:22:10.020 --> 01:22:11.020]   It's not AI.
[01:22:11.020 --> 01:22:12.020]   You know, it's a human.
[01:22:12.020 --> 01:22:13.020]   It's just people type.
[01:22:13.020 --> 01:22:14.020]   It was just pretty cool.
[01:22:14.020 --> 01:22:19.260]   So a fucking baker should write a novel about a lady who does JOTT notes.
[01:22:19.260 --> 01:22:20.820]   There's a novel in there somewhere.
[01:22:20.820 --> 01:22:25.940]   There's a novel of someone getting back to your audible book.
[01:22:25.940 --> 01:22:29.540]   There's a novel of some girl using JOT to, you know, break up with a boyfriend.
[01:22:29.540 --> 01:22:30.540]   And him using JOT to call her back.
[01:22:30.540 --> 01:22:32.500]   Who do you want to JOTT sit there?
[01:22:32.500 --> 01:22:33.500]   My evil boyfriend.
[01:22:33.500 --> 01:22:35.340]   I forgot to show you the best part of the demo.
[01:22:35.340 --> 01:22:37.580]   If you go to that crummy page, I sent you that every--
[01:22:37.580 --> 01:22:40.980]   I bookmarked that, by the way, an M-B-W-I-D as so you can go straight to it.
[01:22:40.980 --> 01:22:44.140]   Go type in F-I-E-L-D in a search.
[01:22:44.140 --> 01:22:45.140]   OK.
[01:22:45.140 --> 01:22:46.140]   And do a search.
[01:22:46.140 --> 01:22:47.140]   F-I-E-L-D, yeah.
[01:22:47.140 --> 01:22:49.500]   Oh, look, field notes.
[01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:52.420]   And it shows that it says field on that thing you took a picture of.
[01:22:52.420 --> 01:22:55.420]   I think it's almost like a Flickr photo where it puts a note over it.
[01:22:55.420 --> 01:22:56.420]   Wow.
[01:22:56.420 --> 01:22:57.420]   Yeah.
[01:22:57.420 --> 01:22:59.380]   I haven't really played with a recognition.
[01:22:59.380 --> 01:23:00.380]   So it's pretty good.
[01:23:00.380 --> 01:23:01.780]   Yeah, but you've got to sync.
[01:23:01.780 --> 01:23:05.300]   It's got to sync to the server and then come back before it'll work locally.
[01:23:05.300 --> 01:23:08.340]   But if it's out in the cloud, it works great.
[01:23:08.340 --> 01:23:09.340]   Yeah.
[01:23:09.340 --> 01:23:12.660]   Justin, you do a lot of photos for the text?
[01:23:12.660 --> 01:23:13.660]   I do.
[01:23:13.660 --> 01:23:17.700]   I mean, I take so many photos and I also take photos of receipts and stuff like that because
[01:23:17.700 --> 01:23:21.500]   I'll forget and lose them or where I purchase the thing.
[01:23:21.500 --> 01:23:22.500]   Wow.
[01:23:22.500 --> 01:23:23.500]   And that seems to work out pretty well, too.
[01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:24.500]   You do that with your iPhone?
[01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:25.500]   Is it good enough?
[01:23:25.500 --> 01:23:26.500]   Yeah.
[01:23:26.500 --> 01:23:27.500]   Wow.
[01:23:27.500 --> 01:23:29.980]   This is a productivity show today.
[01:23:29.980 --> 01:23:30.980]   Well, I mean, I'll tell you.
[01:23:30.980 --> 01:23:35.180]   It's probably another revenue stream that's pretty obvious here is Evernote, just basically
[01:23:35.180 --> 01:23:38.780]   some regular expressions that look for an ASIN or not an ASIN.
[01:23:38.780 --> 01:23:40.220]   Like for an ISBN.
[01:23:40.220 --> 01:23:43.060]   And then when you get back home, you click on that and buy it from Amazon.
[01:23:43.060 --> 01:23:47.420]   We've been begging for that and borders has been going, no.
[01:23:47.420 --> 01:23:48.420]   The dream.
[01:23:48.420 --> 01:23:49.420]   The dream.
[01:23:49.420 --> 01:23:50.420]   No.
[01:23:50.420 --> 01:23:55.700]   Mr. Andy and I co a pick from you, my friend.
[01:23:55.700 --> 01:23:56.700]   Yes.
[01:23:56.700 --> 01:24:01.900]   This was a recommendation that someone emailed to me yesterday that quickly became one of
[01:24:01.900 --> 01:24:03.580]   my favorite apps ever.
[01:24:03.580 --> 01:24:08.860]   It is an ebook reader, actually just a huge ebook solution called stanza.
[01:24:08.860 --> 01:24:11.020]   S-T-A-N-Z-A.
[01:24:11.020 --> 01:24:16.140]   And you can download it from, oh goodness gracious, of course I tabbed away from it.
[01:24:16.140 --> 01:24:22.100]   You can download it from lexcycle.com L-E-X-C-Y-C-L-E.com.
[01:24:22.100 --> 01:24:27.620]   There are a whole bunch of really bad, really half baked book reader apps for the Mac that
[01:24:27.620 --> 01:24:30.940]   you know, where, oh look, it reads a text file.
[01:24:30.940 --> 01:24:34.140]   And when I tap the space bar, it goes to the next page.
[01:24:34.140 --> 01:24:35.220]   Wow.
[01:24:35.220 --> 01:24:37.540]   I remember my first basic program too.
[01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:40.900]   And only $39.
[01:24:40.900 --> 01:24:46.820]   But first of all, just as a book reader, stanza is awesome because it really does a great
[01:24:46.820 --> 01:24:53.020]   job of breaking down these really, really weird online formats like books from Project
[01:24:53.020 --> 01:24:57.900]   Gutenberg, where I, one of the reasons why I always keep BB at it handy is so that I
[01:24:57.900 --> 01:25:03.820]   can run simple Apple scripts that just take all these forced line feed formatting, formatted
[01:25:03.820 --> 01:25:08.220]   Gutenberg books and turn it into a format that's going to flow from page to page really,
[01:25:08.220 --> 01:25:09.220]   really easily.
[01:25:09.220 --> 01:25:12.180]   So it really does a good job of breaking it down, turning it to something that looks
[01:25:12.180 --> 01:25:14.100]   like it was a weird process.
[01:25:14.100 --> 01:25:20.340]   Secondly, it's really keyed very well to reading books on a computer screen.
[01:25:20.340 --> 01:25:25.540]   Instead of giving you one narrow column and just having to tap the space bar, you know,
[01:25:25.540 --> 01:25:31.820]   every 30 seconds, or instead of giving you these huge, long, wide widths of windows,
[01:25:31.820 --> 01:25:36.060]   where you feel as though you need to, you know, carve up, you know, give your eyeballs
[01:25:36.060 --> 01:25:40.860]   or rest after every line, it will actually do a two page spread page after page after
[01:25:40.860 --> 01:25:43.140]   page also really nicely formatted.
[01:25:43.140 --> 01:25:44.860]   There are a bunch of different themes you can apply.
[01:25:44.860 --> 01:25:49.020]   So if you want it to auto scroll like a teleprompter, it'll auto scroll that way.
[01:25:49.020 --> 01:25:53.580]   If you want light text in a dark background, it'll do all that kind of cool stuff.
[01:25:53.580 --> 01:25:55.900]   But that's just features as a book reader.
[01:25:55.900 --> 01:26:01.300]   It also does an awesome job translating ebooks from one format to another.
[01:26:01.300 --> 01:26:07.340]   If you have an Amazon Kindle device, you need Stanza because it will easily and quickly
[01:26:07.340 --> 01:26:12.900]   translate anything you throw at it into not just a format that the Kindle can read.
[01:26:12.900 --> 01:26:14.180]   I mean, it'll can read text files.
[01:26:14.180 --> 01:26:20.140]   It can read PDFs, but it will actually translate it into a properly formatted Amazon book format
[01:26:20.140 --> 01:26:21.740]   file.
[01:26:21.740 --> 01:26:28.620]   And so just in the last 24 hours, I've converted about 18, 19 different books to Kindle format.
[01:26:28.620 --> 01:26:33.260]   And some of these were books that I'd already quote unquote converted, you know, by using
[01:26:33.260 --> 01:26:37.100]   BB edit or some other Apple script to convert it into a format that's going to work really,
[01:26:37.100 --> 01:26:38.740]   really well.
[01:26:38.740 --> 01:26:44.780]   And then email into the Kindle, but the versions that are created by Stanza are way, way better.
[01:26:44.780 --> 01:26:46.100]   It's still in beta.
[01:26:46.100 --> 01:26:48.740]   You can obviously download a fully functional copy.
[01:26:48.740 --> 01:26:53.860]   I think here on the side, it says that there are going to be that's going to be 15 bucks
[01:26:53.860 --> 01:26:57.300]   when it's actually, no, actually, there is a there is a buy now button, but 15 bucks
[01:26:57.300 --> 01:26:59.860]   is dirt cheap for what you get with this app.
[01:26:59.860 --> 01:27:04.940]   I mean, it is again, one of those things where you didn't realize there was this missing
[01:27:04.940 --> 01:27:09.140]   piece to one of your favorite bits of technology until you downloaded the SAP and realized
[01:27:09.140 --> 01:27:13.180]   that, oh, the Amazon, the Kindle is now that much more useful right now.
[01:27:13.180 --> 01:27:14.180]   Cool.
[01:27:14.180 --> 01:27:19.180]   And it's from Lex cycle.com.
[01:27:19.180 --> 01:27:21.500]   Revolution and reading $15.
[01:27:21.500 --> 01:27:23.580]   Is there a try before you buy?
[01:27:23.580 --> 01:27:25.220]   I believe it's fully functional.
[01:27:25.220 --> 01:27:29.020]   I haven't paid yet and I really need to pay for it because I like it so much, but it will
[01:27:29.020 --> 01:27:30.020]   export.
[01:27:30.020 --> 01:27:33.580]   It'll read that I can't see anything that's been turned off, at least in this beta.
[01:27:33.580 --> 01:27:38.460]   So you can tap dance all over it before you let go of a single penny.
[01:27:38.460 --> 01:27:41.620]   How is the how is the iPhone as a reader?
[01:27:41.620 --> 01:27:42.620]   It's good.
[01:27:42.620 --> 01:27:46.380]   As a matter of fact, when I first reviewed the Kindle, that's one of the things that I wrote
[01:27:46.380 --> 01:27:51.300]   about that the experience of I didn't think that it was necessarily superior to reading
[01:27:51.300 --> 01:27:56.140]   a book on the iPhone with obviously the Kindle is bigger.
[01:27:56.140 --> 01:27:59.460]   It has those nice big cozy buttons that you'll accidentally push all the time, but you'll
[01:27:59.460 --> 01:28:00.460]   get the hang of it.
[01:28:00.460 --> 01:28:03.220]   But it's not a back it's not a backlit screen.
[01:28:03.220 --> 01:28:05.540]   Also paging from one to one page to another.
[01:28:05.540 --> 01:28:09.900]   You get that because the technology of the display, it has to reverse itself, like invert
[01:28:09.900 --> 01:28:13.820]   itself to clear out all the pixels before it can redraw it with the iPhone.
[01:28:13.820 --> 01:28:17.780]   You just give it a casual flick of your thumb and you know, you use an iPhone, you know,
[01:28:17.780 --> 01:28:21.300]   that it's very, very, very, very real, very, very tangible.
[01:28:21.300 --> 01:28:25.460]   The screen is backlit, so you don't have to worry about lighting or anything like that.
[01:28:25.460 --> 01:28:27.580]   All we need are really good book readers.
[01:28:27.580 --> 01:28:31.380]   And if you've jailbroken your phone, you know, that there are some really great readers out
[01:28:31.380 --> 01:28:32.380]   there.
[01:28:32.380 --> 01:28:34.980]   The only limitation really is the size of the screen.
[01:28:34.980 --> 01:28:40.340]   You end up having to page a lot more often than you can on the Kindle and certainly a
[01:28:40.340 --> 01:28:46.020]   lot more than you would with Stanza on your MacBook or any other kind of laptop.
[01:28:46.020 --> 01:28:50.620]   I'm really, I mean, there's, I do have, you know, cash in an envelope taped underneath
[01:28:50.620 --> 01:28:51.620]   my desk.
[01:28:51.620 --> 01:28:56.060]   These are the app, the registration fees for apps that I will just plain flat out buy as
[01:28:56.060 --> 01:28:59.380]   soon as I find one that's good when the app store opens.
[01:28:59.380 --> 01:29:03.580]   And one of those apps is going to be a book reader that just lets you put arbitrary text
[01:29:03.580 --> 01:29:06.940]   documents or arbitrary book format documents on the device and read it.
[01:29:06.940 --> 01:29:07.940]   It's just a figure.
[01:29:07.940 --> 01:29:08.940]   That's it.
[01:29:08.940 --> 01:29:09.940]   That's an app that they've got in the where.
[01:29:09.940 --> 01:29:11.700]   I mean, it's got to be somebody's got to be doing it.
[01:29:11.700 --> 01:29:16.420]   I'm looking for this is going to be, I'm absolutely certain that there's going to be
[01:29:16.420 --> 01:29:21.220]   18 really awful ones, three that are good and one that's great.
[01:29:21.220 --> 01:29:26.380]   And four months after the app store opens, they'll be only the one or the two because
[01:29:26.380 --> 01:29:32.740]   it's an easy, it's as easy as hell application to write really difficult and really subtle
[01:29:32.740 --> 01:29:34.500]   to write it correctly.
[01:29:34.500 --> 01:29:35.500]   Right.
[01:29:35.500 --> 01:29:36.500]   Right.
[01:29:36.500 --> 01:29:39.340]   Finally, my friends, Mr. Alex Lindsey with a pick.
[01:29:39.340 --> 01:29:40.340]   Hello, Alex.
[01:29:40.340 --> 01:29:42.700]   Hello, I have.
[01:29:42.700 --> 01:29:44.980]   So this one is actually cost money.
[01:29:44.980 --> 01:29:49.940]   I've been doing a lot of them that are fairly free, but it is a great little app.
[01:29:49.940 --> 01:29:54.340]   And I actually, when I was talking to Ken Giacado, he was doing a class actually right in the
[01:29:54.340 --> 01:29:57.340]   other side of this wall on doing panoramas.
[01:29:57.340 --> 01:29:59.260]   So building big panoramas.
[01:29:59.260 --> 01:30:02.860]   And there's a lot of tools floating around that can do this.
[01:30:02.860 --> 01:30:06.460]   Photoshop, of course, does basic panoramas and does it really, really well.
[01:30:06.460 --> 01:30:08.460]   The new Photoshop will put these basic ones in.
[01:30:08.460 --> 01:30:11.180]   But if you want to go all the way up, so if you want to be able to look all the way up
[01:30:11.180 --> 01:30:15.900]   and all the way around, one that has, you know, was really rough a couple of years ago,
[01:30:15.900 --> 01:30:21.700]   but has gotten a lot better over time is a little program called PT GUI.
[01:30:21.700 --> 01:30:24.780]   Tell me a sandwich.
[01:30:24.780 --> 01:30:25.780]   Yeah.
[01:30:25.780 --> 01:30:26.780]   Yeah.
[01:30:26.780 --> 01:30:36.500]   But you know, what this is, is it's a GUI in front of another, basically a shell project.
[01:30:36.500 --> 01:30:39.300]   And it just makes it a lot easier for you to do it.
[01:30:39.300 --> 01:30:43.220]   So now what you can do is you can take, you know, a bunch of different photos.
[01:30:43.220 --> 01:30:46.100]   You could build a, if you wanted to have a really high resolution photo with a small
[01:30:46.100 --> 01:30:49.020]   camera and you want to take a whole bunch of photos in a couple of rows, two or three
[01:30:49.020 --> 01:30:53.060]   rows, or if you want to shoot all the way around, or if you want to really build a proper
[01:30:53.060 --> 01:30:58.460]   360 degree panorama, this is the, this is a good tool to, to check it out.
[01:30:58.460 --> 01:30:59.460]   It's a really great tool.
[01:30:59.460 --> 01:31:02.300]   And it's, you know, a lot of people that I know are using it.
[01:31:02.300 --> 01:31:05.580]   And so, and so I started, it's not just a panorama, though, that you could stitch a
[01:31:05.580 --> 01:31:08.500]   large square, for instance, out of it.
[01:31:08.500 --> 01:31:09.500]   Exactly.
[01:31:09.500 --> 01:31:11.820]   So you could, you could do a large, you could build that up.
[01:31:11.820 --> 01:31:15.140]   Because there were a lot of times when I was in Australia that I wanted to do like larger
[01:31:15.140 --> 01:31:17.660]   buildings and this would be, this is perfect for that.
[01:31:17.660 --> 01:31:18.660]   Exactly.
[01:31:18.660 --> 01:31:24.660]   One of the things that, that the Photoshop CS3's stitching doesn't really, it does really
[01:31:24.660 --> 01:31:25.780]   well if you have one row.
[01:31:25.780 --> 01:31:28.380]   I mean, exceptional, well, if you're doing one row.
[01:31:28.380 --> 01:31:32.820]   But if you, as soon as you want two rows or three rows up, it gets a little hairy.
[01:31:32.820 --> 01:31:35.180]   So, so this is a great application to do it.
[01:31:35.180 --> 01:31:38.060]   There's a, there's a basic version and a pro version.
[01:31:38.060 --> 01:31:42.380]   And the pro version is a little bit, you know, the basic version, I think it's $127.
[01:31:42.380 --> 01:31:45.900]   And going up, because it's all pegged to the Euro, not the dollar.
[01:31:45.900 --> 01:31:49.460]   And, and the, the pro version is $239.
[01:31:49.460 --> 01:31:53.900]   And a really great deal if, if it's something that, if, something that you're really serious
[01:31:53.900 --> 01:31:54.900]   about.
[01:31:54.900 --> 01:31:57.620]   And I got to say, once you start shooting panoramas, whether it's just basic ones going around
[01:31:57.620 --> 01:32:02.620]   or, or other ones, you know, you just really want to have that opportunity, you know, that
[01:32:02.620 --> 01:32:04.580]   option all the time.
[01:32:04.580 --> 01:32:10.500]   The pro version will handle high dynamic range images, HDRs, as well as it has some tonal
[01:32:10.500 --> 01:32:11.500]   mapping built into it.
[01:32:11.500 --> 01:32:15.220]   So it, it, if you really, what that's good for is if you want to build a pano in your
[01:32:15.220 --> 01:32:18.500]   house and you want to be able to see out the windows and all the detail out the windows
[01:32:18.500 --> 01:32:23.580]   and see the shadow areas in your, in, you know, in your house and you can get all of
[01:32:23.580 --> 01:32:27.940]   that in one or you, you take a couple different shots and it puts it together for you.
[01:32:27.940 --> 01:32:33.460]   So it's anyway, that's called, it's called PT GUI and you can find it at PT GUI.com.
[01:32:33.460 --> 01:32:36.540]   And if you, if you're interested in panos, you should definitely check it out.
[01:32:36.540 --> 01:32:40.860]   There's a down, you can download a, a demo version and play with it.
[01:32:40.860 --> 01:32:42.380]   With yourself.
[01:32:42.380 --> 01:32:43.380]   Play with it yourself.
[01:32:43.380 --> 01:32:45.260]   Very careful how you say that, please.
[01:32:45.260 --> 01:32:47.300]   I know it came out a little quick.
[01:32:47.300 --> 01:32:51.140]   And yeah, that, that didn't, that didn't, not exactly what I meant.
[01:32:51.140 --> 01:32:52.140]   That's not what I meant.
[01:32:52.140 --> 01:32:54.140]   I didn't mean that.
[01:32:54.140 --> 01:32:55.800]   Great pick all around.
[01:32:55.800 --> 01:32:56.800]   Great picks.
[01:32:56.800 --> 01:33:00.980]   And you know, sometime Merlin add that jot to our list of productivity tools.
[01:33:00.980 --> 01:33:03.560]   Uh, I'd love to see how you use jot.
[01:33:03.560 --> 01:33:04.560]   Yeah.
[01:33:04.560 --> 01:33:05.560]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:33:05.560 --> 01:33:07.100]   I mean, they keep adding out periodically.
[01:33:07.100 --> 01:33:08.100]   They don't have ever known.
[01:33:08.100 --> 01:33:09.260]   I just checked and I sent them a note.
[01:33:09.260 --> 01:33:10.260]   I sent them an email.
[01:33:10.260 --> 01:33:12.480]   Oh no, no, no, no, but, but, but you can.
[01:33:12.480 --> 01:33:14.840]   I see the custom, but I don't know how I would do that.
[01:33:14.840 --> 01:33:18.920]   The hack is that you just make it a, you know, email contact.
[01:33:18.920 --> 01:33:20.880]   You can create ad hoc people to send stuff to you.
[01:33:20.880 --> 01:33:21.880]   Okay.
[01:33:21.880 --> 01:33:22.880]   I just have email it to ever not.
[01:33:22.880 --> 01:33:23.880]   Yeah.
[01:33:23.880 --> 01:33:24.880]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:33:24.880 --> 01:33:25.880]   I'll figure that out.
[01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:27.080]   Cause right now I use it for, you can Twitter with it.
[01:33:27.080 --> 01:33:28.080]   You can, you can do it.
[01:33:28.080 --> 01:33:32.120]   I mean, I could, I, and now that I know that you're on it, I can jot you.
[01:33:32.120 --> 01:33:34.320]   I could say jot Merlin man and send you a note.
[01:33:34.320 --> 01:33:35.320]   Yeah.
[01:33:35.320 --> 01:33:36.320]   It's great.
[01:33:36.320 --> 01:33:39.880]   To be honest, I use it all the time where, like you care, where my wife will be, um, watching
[01:33:39.880 --> 01:33:41.400]   our daughter at home while I'm away.
[01:33:41.400 --> 01:33:46.760]   It's just easier to call her than email her and, uh, rather easier to email her than call
[01:33:46.760 --> 01:33:49.360]   her and cause she'll have a computer, but her phone will be off.
[01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:50.360]   Can you have a text?
[01:33:50.360 --> 01:33:51.360]   Can you do it?
[01:33:51.360 --> 01:33:52.360]   Have it sent text as well?
[01:33:52.360 --> 01:33:53.360]   SMS.
[01:33:53.360 --> 01:33:55.360]   Uh, no, that would be cool.
[01:33:55.360 --> 01:33:56.360]   I don't know.
[01:33:56.360 --> 01:33:57.360]   Maybe I don't.
[01:33:57.360 --> 01:33:58.360]   There must be some way to do that.
[01:33:58.360 --> 01:34:02.560]   Send it to a, you know, email it to some portal that would then SMS it.
[01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:03.560]   That's a good one.
[01:34:03.560 --> 01:34:06.480]   Oh, you know, you know, we should mention we didn't mention this kind of huge.
[01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:11.320]   Did you guys see the thing about the AT&T site, the secret AT&T site you can go to?
[01:34:11.320 --> 01:34:14.920]   No, to shut off SMS's that aren't from real phones.
[01:34:14.920 --> 01:34:15.920]   No.
[01:34:15.920 --> 01:34:19.120]   So if you start getting this, actually you can whitelist and blacklist.
[01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:20.720]   Um, I know.
[01:34:20.720 --> 01:34:22.120]   Justine wants to know more about that.
[01:34:22.120 --> 01:34:23.120]   How do you do it?
[01:34:23.120 --> 01:34:24.120]   Seriously.
[01:34:24.120 --> 01:34:27.280]   Um, it's, well, I did all this out in post.
[01:34:27.280 --> 01:34:28.280]   My ATTSMS.
[01:34:28.280 --> 01:34:35.040]   I could probably, uh, I can, I bet if we, if we search for it in Google news, you could
[01:34:35.040 --> 01:34:36.600]   probably, so as a recent news story?
[01:34:36.600 --> 01:34:37.600]   Yeah.
[01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:38.600]   Yeah.
[01:34:38.600 --> 01:34:40.200]   But there's a, there's a site where you go in and you got to like register for it, but
[01:34:40.200 --> 01:34:44.000]   you go in and give your phone number and a password and then you can go in.
[01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:47.160]   There's like shut off all because I guess it can detect whether it's from a real phone
[01:34:47.160 --> 01:34:48.160]   or from like a domain.
[01:34:48.160 --> 01:34:49.160]   Oh, that would be great.
[01:34:49.160 --> 01:34:51.600]   It's like only send me stuff from real phones.
[01:34:51.600 --> 01:34:54.600]   So then I guess you might not get stuff like Twitter, but you could definitely go in and
[01:34:54.600 --> 01:34:55.600]   whitelist and blacklist.
[01:34:55.600 --> 01:34:56.600]   You could tell.
[01:34:56.600 --> 01:34:58.800]   You know, you're getting anything from Twitter anyway.
[01:34:58.800 --> 01:35:00.560]   I don't know what's going on with Twitter.
[01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:01.560]   All that shuts off.
[01:35:01.560 --> 01:35:03.920]   All that's off off off off off off off off off off off off off off off off off off off off.
[01:35:03.920 --> 01:35:07.080]   And they got, by the way, the Twitter just got a big infusion of money.
[01:35:07.080 --> 01:35:09.160]   No one knows exactly how much I'm sure you do, Meron.
[01:35:09.160 --> 01:35:10.160]   But no, it's not.
[01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:11.160]   Oh, hi.
[01:35:11.160 --> 01:35:12.160]   Oh, hi.
[01:35:12.160 --> 01:35:13.160]   You're in with all that stuff.
[01:35:13.160 --> 01:35:14.160]   You're in with all that stuff.
[01:35:14.160 --> 01:35:15.160]   You're in with all that stuff.
[01:35:15.160 --> 01:35:16.160]   You're in with all that stuff.
[01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:17.160]   You're in with all that stuff.
[01:35:17.160 --> 01:35:18.160]   You're in with all that stuff.
[01:35:18.160 --> 01:35:19.160]   You're in with all that stuff.
