[00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.920]   Apple needs and with us three of the biggest best Apple journalists in the world
[00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.840]   starting with Andy Inako of the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:56.840]   Hey, host Skipper.
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.400]   It's good to see you.
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.280]   Good to see you have Memorial Day, Memorial left on your screen.
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.600]   Yes, this was in the Boston Common yesterday.
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.480]   They had the soldiers and sailors monument that's on the top of a hill.
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.480]   So they had the entire hill covered with flags.
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.640]   I think the number was actually significant to the number of New Englanders or
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.200]   someone's lost.
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.000]   And so you have two thoughts.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.280]   Number one, and yeah, when you do, it's not like this was announced.
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.280]   I was just, as a matter of fact, I was across the street in the public garden.
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.840]   And I saw, oh, that hill that I've seen all the time that's usually green is now
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:32.960]   white and red and blue.
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.000]   That's interesting.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.520]   And I'm T.C. the enormity of, well, here are X thousand objects identical to this
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.760]   number we keep throwing about.
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:40.920]   That's how many of those are.
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:41.960]   That brings you home.
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:42.480]   Yep.
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.560]   I came here for an interesting picture, but now I'm appropriately a little bit
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.880]   mowing-colly.
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.760]   Probably not good to have the scroll on top of it because some might confuse it
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.720]   not knowing it was Memorial Day, you know, when they watch it in six months and
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.560]   think that's how many squirrels were on your lawn or something.
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.720]   Very patriotic squirrel.
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:58.720]   Yes.
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:04.480]   Also with us from Australia, where it is early in the morning, Mr. Alex Lindsay,
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.120]   just coming up on 4.30.
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.120]   Good day.
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.760]   Yeah, it's a little early this morning, but I usually get up pretty early anyway.
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.600]   Tell me you're there for fun, not work.
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:14.600]   Work.
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.360]   I don't really travel for fun.
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.680]   For fun as I do barbecue.
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.680]   Fun is staying home.
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:21.680]   Yeah.
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:22.680]   Yeah.
[00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:23.680]   So we're here there.
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.520]   Seabit here in Salesforce was doing some work here.
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.520]   Also fun.
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.320]   So I was I was here helping with that.
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.320]   Fun.
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:30.320]   That's awesome.
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.120]   Also from Montreal joining us right now, Mr. Renee Richie of iMore.com.
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.120]   Hi Renee.
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.120]   Hi Leo.
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.120]   How's it going?
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.120]   Good.
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.240]   I'm hoping you can gin up some rumors for us because it's kind of a slow week in the
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.240]   math world.
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:46.040]   We have F1 coming up next week, so I'm going to say Apple is going to release a race car.
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.720]   This is the lull before the storm.
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.720]   Of course, WWDC now two weeks away.
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:55.800]   And I think that it's pretty likely that, you know, everybody's just waiting now, although
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.680]   often this is when you get the most fervent rumor mongering.
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.160]   Is there a drumbeat going on stage the first time this year, Leo, what did apples take
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.160]   in the stage?
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.160]   Yeah.
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.160]   Yeah.
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.160]   That's what I mean.
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.160]   I mean, this is it's been six months, seven months.
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.720]   Well, usually it's like next week is the most interesting thing because if there's actual
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.280]   hardware that they're going to be showing off, that's usually the window during which
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.080]   it's now not really possible from the lockdown every single person who has to hold and touch
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.600]   this object before the show begins.
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.120]   So that's the time when you see your picture.
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.800]   You're at least you don't necessarily believe it, but at least you're in that time frame
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.720]   where you're thinking, okay, this is not the most it's not the most ridiculous thing in
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.440]   the world to think that this is a picture of a retina iPad mini, which it's still it's
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.840]   still not the right time for an iPad, retin iPad mini.
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.960]   But at least you're saying this is purports to be that thing.
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:46.960]   You're at least willing to.
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.280]   Okay, let me look at this critically as opposed to simply nodding and smiling and then saying
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.800]   it's kind of an attack.
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.120]   Retin a Mac mini Andy.
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.120]   You've nailed it.
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:02.360]   Well, I think that's the note screening on that logo is just you just can't go back to
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.760]   the old silk screen logo.
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.240]   I read them.
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.640]   I think that it's interesting that the WWDC has really become the big event.
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:10.640]   I mean, for for Apple.
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:14.160]   So I think it's interesting that it's a developers conference that is that was really what's
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.640]   getting, you know, highlighted not only highlights of course what Apple is releasing, but also
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:22.800]   their developers and how successful the developers are and how popular WWDC is.
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.680]   But I think that I think if I'm unless I'm mistaken, I think this is the really the biggest
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.840]   event of the year for now that you know, Apple doesn't go to Mac world and doesn't go to
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:29.840]   anything else.
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:33.160]   This is the one time where the, you know, the only scheduled one.
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.160]   Yeah, calendar.
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.160]   Yeah.
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:40.160]   I would say I would say the September rollout is as significant only because everybody's
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.720]   expecting here specifically here's something.
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.520]   Consumerie that they're going to have to show off at this point if they keep the street
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.120]   going because they're going to be releasing stuff for the holidays.
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.160]   Whereas we've been, we've been seeing cool things at WWDC to show here's what the new
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.200]   operating system is going to be like for both iOS and Mac OS.
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.080]   And sometimes that's going to be a good thing.
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.200]   And sometimes that's going to be another one of those.
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.200]   Nod.
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:02.200]   Take the free tote bag.
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.040]   Walk out and blog about it moments.
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.360]   So what do we know?
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.360]   What don't we know?
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.360]   What do we know about what we don't know?
[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:12.240]   Everything we know that we don't know about what we know is that we know that it'll be
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:18.440]   10 a.m. Pacific time on June 10th, which is a Monday, which is exactly the same time
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:23.040]   Microsoft is having their next Xbox press conference at E3.
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.280]   We'll, you know, I'm trying to think, Chad, and I think what we're going to do is we're
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:30.640]   going to cover both and we'll do left channel, right channel audio.
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.840]   Audio in the left channel will be from the Microsoft.
[00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:33.840]   Exactly.
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.720]   And the audio in the right channel would be from W.D.
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.880]   And that way you won't or will and we'll do a little picture and picture maybe the Microsoft
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.520]   because I think people are going to really want to know what Apple has to say.
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.480]   We already kind of know a little bit about the Xbox.
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.080]   It just makes lots of sense.
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.080]   Why not?
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.360]   Is this going to be like dark side of the moon sinking up to?
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:52.080]   Yeah, it's going to be amazing because I'm going to have Tim Cook.
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.920]   Audio from one, the visuals from the other.
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:54.920]   Exactly.
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:57.000]   Just do that for five minutes and see how well it syncs up.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.400]   It'll be amazing about Tim Cook and whoever Steve Baumer going.
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.440]   And now we'd like to show you the new Xbox one.
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.440]   Why not?
[00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:06.200]   And it'll be just fabulous.
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.200]   It'll be the first Xbox Nano.
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:09.200]   The Xbox Nano.
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.320]   It all mesh together.
[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:12.320]   We will be doing live care.
[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:16.120]   I think we'll probably do live coverage at WWDC with it with an eye out on the Microsoft
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:17.120]   thing.
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:21.880]   We will have Jeff Gersman in a soundproof box going in hushed voices and now they're
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:28.440]   revealing 10 a.m. Pacific means we'll do it right after we'll do it early TNT and we'll
[00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:29.520]   do that.
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.200]   And I will be here and Tom will be here.
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.760]   But Annie is going to be at the event, right?
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:34.760]   I am Renee.
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:37.880]   And Renee is going to be at the event.
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.960]   So what we're going to do is Mac break weekly will be at its usual time the next day on
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:41.960]   Tuesday.
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:43.680]   But you guys will be live in studio with us.
[00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:44.680]   I'll be awesome.
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:45.680]   Yeah.
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:48.200]   And you said our first meet space episode.
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:49.920]   It'll be the first meet episode.
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:53.160]   Yes indeed.
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:58.040]   I guess, you know, we know the only thing we're I think everybody agrees that we're sure
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:00.880]   about is iOS seven.
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:01.880]   We'll be talked about.
[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:02.880]   Yes.
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:06.680]   And I think that one of the other things is probably pretty prevalent as far as people
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:13.000]   expecting is a new you know, in iOS seven, the Johnny I've version of the of our new
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.160]   icons and everything else.
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:17.120]   I think a lot of people are expecting to have to see what he plans to do.
[00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:22.520]   Have there been any leaks at all of of what that might be people talking about it, but
[00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:26.840]   no one's got any screenshots of it that I know they're seeing now more monochrome.
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:27.840]   It sounds like more money.
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:31.760]   I heard I've heard from two people now that it's kind of silver and black Mark German
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:33.480]   from nine to five, Mac heard white and black.
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:36.400]   That could just be a difference in how people describe what they saw.
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:37.400]   Hmm.
[00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:38.400]   The interesting.
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:39.400]   I'm sorry.
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:40.400]   Go ahead.
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:41.400]   Go ahead.
[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:42.720]   I was going to say it does sound like he is taking it.
[00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:45.800]   You know, iTunes went very colorless and it does sound like they're pulling a lot of the
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:50.200]   color out of the palette and then they're going to use color selectively to sort of
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:53.040]   highlight differences in the apps.
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.040]   Hmm.
[00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:58.720]   But I haven't been hearing what I've been hearing a lot about consistency from app to
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:03.280]   app and one person sort of described and this is not a really great source, but was describing
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:09.240]   to me as making sure there wasn't quite so many jarring differences from one experience
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:15.000]   to the other throughout the built in built in apps and which I which I thought to be
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:22.760]   kind of interesting because I like I would be disappointed if the iPhone experience became
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:27.440]   every single app looks so similar to each other that there aren't a whole lot of visual
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:32.000]   cues that this list view you're in right now is the notes app list view versus this list
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   view I'm in right now is the mail app view because especially when I'm dealing with a
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.680]   tiny handheld device, you know, like a phone, I need some sort of a cue to remind myself
[00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:44.600]   like when I first wake it up that this is the this is the space that I'm in right now.
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:49.200]   And if there was two consistent, yeah, it would I'm not sure if it would be more difficult
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:53.640]   to use, but it would be something that have to get used to is maps a model for what we
[00:09:53.640 --> 00:10:01.760]   might see maps is the most recent Apple app and it is certainly flatter podcast to right.
[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:06.000]   I think looking we're looking for flatter than the maps app and to Andy's point, I know
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.240]   in previous management at Apple, knowing what app you're in the minute you hit it was more
[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:14.560]   of an importance like if you were in the contacts view in game center, you would never mistake
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:18.160]   that for the contacts view and phone or the contacts you and find my friends.
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:22.520]   So if they are sort of, you know, snow leoparding the thing and making it more consistent, I'd
[00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:24.360]   also worry about that usability level.
[00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:25.360]   I don't know.
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:28.440]   You know, I'm thinking about Windows phone where there is Microsoft has enforced a very
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:31.240]   standard consistent UI.
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:33.360]   And I think it works pretty well.
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:35.760]   It makes it the phone feel more unified.
[00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:40.040]   It's a little monotonous and a little like the information density is very low.
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:42.640]   It's a little monotonous and I have gotten lost once or twice.
[00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:43.640]   Have you?
[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:44.640]   Okay.
[00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:45.640]   Now, of course, this is only Apple's own apps.
[00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:48.200]   Third party apps are going to go where they go.
[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:52.960]   Well, in some ways, if Apple goes very flat and third party apps don't, in some ways,
[00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:57.840]   they're their their applications make pop out a little bit more, you know, within the
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:58.840]   interface as well.
[00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:01.280]   Remember folks, this is all about style, right?
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:02.280]   Design styles change.
[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:04.280]   Fins came in, fins went.
[00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:06.720]   Chrome went in, came in, Chrome went.
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:14.840]   And some of it was some of it was informed by perhaps even prompted by changes in technology.
[00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:19.240]   You know, cars look different today because we can use computer design and different materials
[00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:22.000]   to make them more curvy, for instance.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.600]   But I think a lot of it is just design style.
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:31.520]   And the style was skeuomorphism and aqua and lickable, Steve Jobs, lickable interface,
[00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:33.240]   which is very colorful, right?
[00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:39.240]   And then what happens is, you know, in order to keep things fresh and cynic might say,
[00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:43.120]   in order to keep people buying because you don't want to have the old design.
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:47.760]   And since we can't really change technology as fast as me might like to, especially now
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:52.640]   with a mobile is pretty mature, especially on the Apple side.
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:55.520]   Maybe it's time to, you know, use the design to drive people to new problems.
[00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:59.960]   But I think there's also, I kind of, when I was, I just feel like that Johnny Ive has
[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:02.120]   been sitting there working on the hardware for a long time.
[00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:06.000]   And I don't know if it's, if it's a general flow of Apple more than Johnny Ive just wanting
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.400]   to get his two cents in.
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:12.800]   I mean, I think it's, I think that the skeuomorph, the rumors are that he, that whole look is
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:14.480]   kind of driven him crazy for a long time.
[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:17.440]   And now that he has the ability to move it, he's going to.
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:20.720]   Well, there's, there's, there is the problem of having too much, you know, wickety whack
[00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:24.880]   on the interface stuff that really doesn't do anything except for make it look pretty.
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:29.760]   And the problem is that functional is something that you can really prove in a lab looks pretty
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:32.280]   as something that's going to be very, very subjective.
[00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:36.640]   But I think that one of the big drivers for this is not just the need for change, which
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:40.560]   is important enough, but also the fact that more and more of Apple device, Apple devices
[00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:44.440]   are really, really high intensity, high resolution displays.
[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:51.480]   Now that's moving farther across the desktop OS situation as we go.
[00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:58.720]   And the thing is that when you have a tooled leather background, now and it's on a 300
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:05.960]   DPI 400 DPI retina level display, that's a lot more, that's a lot more distracting.
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:09.500]   And that's a, then it would be like a lower resolution.
[00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:13.720]   Higher resolution is something that makes fonts stand out a lot, lot better.
[00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:16.760]   You really do notice how much crisper letters are.
[00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:20.400]   And not only do you have a problem of adding more detail to background stuff, like again,
[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:24.560]   that brush metal that tooled leather sort of look, but also now you're increasing the
[00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:27.040]   load of how big an app has to be.
[00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:31.120]   If you're going to have all of these super, super, super high density retina graphics,
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:35.340]   and now your entire interface is based on having these super, super high density elements.
[00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:39.280]   Now you're basically taking an app that used to be kind of compact and could be downloaded
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:43.980]   easily over a cell network and making it huge and not really adding any functionality to
[00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:44.980]   it.
[00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:49.340]   So I do think that the prime mover is going is really, we've had this interface for a
[00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:50.340]   long time.
[00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:53.860]   We need to freshen up a little, but I think there's also this, it's also been moved a
[00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:57.100]   little bit by the increase in the quality of the displays across the map, at the Apple
[00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:58.100]   line.
[00:13:58.100 --> 00:13:59.100]   I think Andy's right.
[00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:03.180]   I mean, Windows phone and Android famously went flat because they wouldn't have to composite.
[00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:04.180]   They wouldn't have to mask.
[00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:07.420]   They wouldn't have to do a lot of the heavy graphics lifting and it increased performance.
[00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:11.720]   And with iOS, they were fine because they have a really good open GL layer and they have
[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:13.400]   a really good compositing.
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:16.960]   But by getting rid of a lot of that stuff, they become even faster.
[00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:21.160]   And I know some designers I've spoken with who are big fans of the rich sort of textures.
[00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:24.780]   They're still anticipating a lot of work because they think where Apple goes, so will the market
[00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:28.600]   and a lot of people will be coming to them to get their apps redesigned to look more,
[00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:32.640]   you know, quote unquote modern, like whatever iOS seven is going to look like.
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:34.440]   I still think I would go the other way though.
[00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:36.800]   So I think everyone goes flat.
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:41.360]   I would make mine really look really 3D so that if you look at your iPhone and you see
[00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:46.340]   like one app like sticking out like a little mountain in two years or three, it'll be something
[00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:47.340]   else.
[00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:48.340]   I think it's just what happens.
[00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:49.340]   This is design.
[00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:50.940]   Design is very style driven.
[00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:51.940]   It's just like tradition.
[00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:52.940]   It's trending.
[00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:57.380]   Alex, this is something that I suddenly want to ask you with your experience.
[00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:01.860]   Are we getting close to the point where you're not hiring a graphic designer to design a
[00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:02.860]   user interface?
[00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:07.820]   Now you're pretty much wanting to go into TV and video and film to hire a set designer.
[00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:12.540]   So it really understands how light interacts with surfaces and how to draw attention to
[00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:16.360]   one thing over the other because the lighting effects we're seeing even in the simple to
[00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:20.620]   do list app is something that you would like to see in an American international picture
[00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:23.680]   from 1964 like kicks butt from the movie.
[00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:28.720]   The guys that work on a lot of those icons are, you know, they're doing heavy 3D to do
[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:29.720]   those.
[00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:33.280]   And those are designers that could get a lot of work somewhere else.
[00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:35.040]   They're not building them the way they used to.
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:38.760]   Most of those are 3D rendered in a variety of applications.
[00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:41.560]   So you really are for the scumorphic.
[00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:47.000]   So if scumorphic goes away, then that changes a little bit.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.960]   But I think that you definitely have to think more and more.
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:56.680]   And I think that for graphic designers, they just have to become, they have to widen their
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:57.920]   understanding of what's going on.
[00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:59.760]   That used to be something that you could just work in Photoshop.
[00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:03.280]   But now, for instance, a lot of times when you see people build interfaces that are only
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:08.080]   in Photoshop that aren't really using 3D, even if they're fairly flat, it looks like
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:09.080]   Photoshop.
[00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:10.080]   That looks like a Photoshop trick.
[00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:12.560]   You know that little emboss or the little edges.
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:15.000]   And people still, you still see that on websites.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.360]   And you either have to do a lot of work in Photoshop to make that work or you have to
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:21.760]   start adding 3D tools to the system.
[00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:25.360]   And a lot of them are using stuff like Cinema 4D or Strata.
[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:30.320]   And graphic design realms, those are the two probably most popular to make that work.
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:32.640]   We just interviewed Chris Harris for Iterate.
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:35.120]   And he does a lot of work for the BBC in HarperCollins.
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:37.680]   He did Wonders of the Universe and Atlas.
[00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:40.880]   And he calls himself an app director because he said companies like that don't understand
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:42.240]   what a developer is.
[00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:47.240]   And he does a lot of his user experience work in motion and then hands that off because
[00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:50.440]   it gives people something they can relate to better in terms of those kind of cinematic
[00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:51.440]   visuals.
[00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:52.440]   Yeah.
[00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:53.440]   I think we'll see more of that.
[00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:55.520]   But I think that Flinzy is the 3D guy.
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:58.640]   You designed Princess Leia's Starship.
[00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:00.040]   I didn't design anything.
[00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:01.040]   I just implemented it.
[00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:02.040]   You implemented it.
[00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:03.800]   But that is very 3D, right?
[00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:06.640]   I mean, it's CGI for a movie.
[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:12.640]   And that was the one in episode one rather where it was so beautiful and reflective.
[00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:15.000]   All I did was make that thing fly around.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   You did something.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.720]   You flew a Starship Alex.
[00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:22.320]   You did more than I did.
[00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:25.920]   But the point being that's not going to ever change because you're modeling 3D objects
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:28.360]   in space for a movie to make them look real.
[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:32.440]   In a lot of ways, 3D is becoming more and more important for everything from e-learning
[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:33.440]   to corporate communication.
[00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:35.640]   I mean, the way we use it now is so different.
[00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:36.800]   I mean, I'm using motion capture.
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:40.160]   We have, I mean, right next to where you're sitting, we have a big motion capture studio
[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:44.040]   with the 36 cameras that we use for mostly corporate work.
[00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:45.040]   Right.
[00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:46.040]   And e-learning.
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:47.520]   And so it's not going to go away.
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:48.520]   Yeah.
[00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:49.520]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:52.280]   And so no, I think that the 3D, I mean, it may go away from the user to the user.
[00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:58.480]   And I think that, you know, Apple has a, you know, a specific, you know, view of that.
[00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:04.800]   And so it's one of those things that I guess I feel like my experience with interface
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:08.040]   design is that we tried a lot of flat stuff and then we always found ourselves back.
[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:09.240]   You know, we'd go to flat.
[00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:10.240]   We'd be flat for a while.
[00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:11.240]   This is in the 90s.
[00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:13.880]   And then we'd end up back in Schumorfism because people like to touch things.
[00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:17.800]   So it'll be interesting to see, you know, how that flow goes.
[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:18.800]   Okay.
[00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:20.520]   Because it was easier for us.
[00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:21.800]   It was easier to do in Photoshop.
[00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:23.400]   So we didn't want to do it in 3D.
[00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:24.400]   Right.
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:26.520]   So, you know, we would prefer to do everything flat.
[00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:29.720]   And then we just found that when we did, when I was working, I did a bunch of interface
[00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:32.160]   design for a broader bun product.
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:36.120]   And we just found that when we showed them the flat version, which we did a lot of work
[00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:39.520]   on and then we showed them the 3D version, which I rendered out of 3D models and with
[00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:41.120]   3D models and everything else, they prefer them.
[00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:49.080]   I guess that's my point, which is it's hard to make a case that the new anti-scuomorphic
[00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:51.600]   mode is better.
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:55.040]   It really to me seems more like it's style.
[00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:56.040]   I agree.
[00:18:56.040 --> 00:19:00.080]   I mean, and I think it makes a lot of sense for if you look at all the other design that
[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:04.840]   Apple has, I think that that flat view for poor Apple makes a lot of sense.
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:08.440]   I don't know if it's necessarily going to make a lot of sense for all of the developers.
[00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:11.120]   And I think that as I said, if everyone goes one direction, oftentimes the best thing to
[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:12.120]   do is go the other.
[00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:13.120]   Right.
[00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:16.600]   So it makes you a handful of developers, you know, going the other direction with the design.
[00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:17.600]   Right.
[00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:21.560]   Also, Apple has a really specific responsibility because they make the devices for the people
[00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:25.960]   who don't really want to have to learn a whole lot that want things that work and seem consistent
[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:27.000]   across the board.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.520]   And you can make the case that advanced users are going to want to replace whatever the stock
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:34.920]   calendar app is with something more muscular with the stock email app.
[00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:39.520]   But I think the majority of iPhone users will use the exact same notes app, the exact same
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:43.240]   mail app, the exact same this that and the other that came pre-installed in the device.
[00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:46.200]   So for that reason, it really is important for all of these to look like they were designed
[00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:50.240]   by the same hand and are designed to interoperate with one another.
[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:53.320]   And it's interesting to juggle the priorities because for a lot of people, the interface
[00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:54.320]   is the app.
[00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:57.680]   And just by inter just by changing the interface, it will look like a whole new experience.
[00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:01.120]   Meanwhile, there's iCloud and there's Siri and there's all these things that Apple has
[00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:04.960]   to devote a lot of infrastructure time to that aren't as sexy and people don't always
[00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:05.960]   notice as much.
[00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:09.640]   So balancing those things, given how small their teams are now tight, their deadlines
[00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:13.960]   are is going to be interesting.
[00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:19.200]   But we know it's going to be as Mark Gurman on a nine to five Mac calls it black and white
[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:21.200]   and flat all over.
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:22.200]   Flatter.
[00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:27.600]   I don't know if it's going to be black and white, black and silver maybe black and black
[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:28.600]   and black.
[00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:33.880]   Well, because the weird thing is, this is another legendary conversation that I had
[00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:39.480]   at a conference like four or five years ago, where a gallery painter was telling me about
[00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:42.840]   how when he paints white, he never uses white.
[00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:47.800]   And when he paints black, he never uses black, he wants to combine colors that will look
[00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:51.200]   black at first glance, but your brain will process as something different.
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:52.200]   It's deeper than that.
[00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:53.200]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:54.200]   It's so vertical.
[00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:55.200]   Yeah.
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:56.920]   Yeah, or or something a little bit more subtle.
[00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:58.120]   Well I was out car shopping.
[00:20:58.120 --> 00:20:59.440]   You can't buy a black car.
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:01.440]   You can buy a black pearl.
[00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:03.400]   We can have one with gold flex.
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:04.400]   I'm not kidding.
[00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:09.440]   Gold flex, green flex, blue flex, but it's they all look black to the immediate eye, but
[00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:10.440]   it is.
[00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:12.360]   It's a deeper, richer kind of a thing.
[00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:15.400]   And when you're buying the batmobile, you want it to really pop.
[00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:16.400]   Right.
[00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:18.400]   I don't want matte black.
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:21.400]   Does anybody, they do make black cars.
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:26.400]   I saw a matte black, a matte green khaki green nook.
[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:28.640]   Oh, I guess that was an army vehicle.
[00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:29.640]   Never mind.
[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:30.640]   No, I saw one.
[00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:36.000]   I saw a defender 90, a Range Rover, defender 90, black and I was like, I need that.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.800]   It's the stealth rover.
[00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:40.400]   I mean, like nature is not a nature is filled with textures.
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.000]   There's not a lot that's really flat in nature.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.920]   And our eyes typically use the density of a texture to sort of pull elements apart and
[00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:47.520]   visually distinguish them.
[00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:48.520]   Right.
[00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:52.120]   And if you look at even Hollywood has gone texture nuts, the new Superman suit is completely
[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:53.120]   textured.
[00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:54.520]   Yeah, it's very true.
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:56.240]   And those are almost visual overload.
[00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:58.760]   So there seems to be a balance somewhere between total flat.
[00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:04.760]   And in fact, they probably in modern sci fi would not make Princess Leia's Starship so perfect
[00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:06.640]   and shiny, they distress it.
[00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:08.600]   Well, there was a lot of distress in that.
[00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:11.760]   If you if you go back and look, believe me, I work really.
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:12.760]   I know you did.
[00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:14.200]   So I'm I defer to you.
[00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:16.800]   There were 14 there were 14 passes of distress.
[00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:17.800]   Oh, so they do.
[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:19.760]   So they look pretty damn shiny though.
[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:23.720]   I mean, they so they have little dings and dents from when it's at the grocery store parking
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:27.080]   lot and somebody opened their Starship next door and yeah, like what one of the jobs was
[00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:28.080]   killer.
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:31.840]   The hard part is is that when you start talking about distress on a ship, you you deal with
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:37.280]   this issue where, you know, the specular or the reflections actually pick up the distress
[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:38.280]   first.
[00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:39.920]   And so you have to build it build all the stuff out.
[00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:42.760]   But if you actually look at it going by, you'll see all this little specs of stuff of
[00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:44.960]   the stuff and scratches and everything else.
[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:46.200]   And that's actually that was most of the work.
[00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:47.520]   It's easy to make and the computer.
[00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:48.520]   It's easy to make things look clean.
[00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:52.520]   It was what was hard was to make it look because all of that gives a scale.
[00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:55.880]   So if we don't have if you don't have all those little specks, you have no idea how big
[00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:58.360]   the object is and how and it doesn't feel like you touch it.
[00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:02.400]   But I became kind of obsessed with I almost wrecked a couple of times taking pictures
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:06.600]   of of gas tankers going by and goes like, Oh, that's exactly what I want.
[00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:08.520]   And those, you know, right.
[00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:14.000]   So it's but but that is that I mean that that subtle texture is the key although Apple hasn't
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.240]   used a lot of that in there.
[00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:16.240]   I don't know.
[00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:17.640]   I haven't seen Apple use a lot of grunge.
[00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:22.040]   There was but again to talk about trend there was a time when sci-fi was all about shiny
[00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:26.400]   and new and then it became more much more realistic by the time a blade runner where
[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:29.320]   stuff was battered and beaten and kind of grungy.
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:30.320]   Yeah.
[00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:31.640]   And Superman's going through the same transition.
[00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:32.640]   Okay.
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:38.440]   But but isn't part of that the idea that Superman was originally created in the,
[00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:42.400]   excuse me, the first Superman movie was in the 70s for people who grew up seeing that
[00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:46.920]   very flat right comic book sort of textures.
[00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:51.120]   I think that now you need to you need to add those kind of textures to Superman's costume
[00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:54.560]   a because the people who are going to be wanting to see it today are the people who grew up
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:59.200]   like in the 90s when digital coloring allowed you to do cool things with Superman's outfit.
[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:03.880]   And also the same reason why like Captain America's like tunic top it used to be just
[00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:07.240]   sort of we're not going to we don't have the we don't have the printing technology to tell
[00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:08.560]   you what it's made of.
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:10.360]   But back in the 90s or early 2000s.
[00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:11.360]   Okay.
[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:13.120]   Now we're going to draw it so that looks like it's chain mail.
[00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:14.660]   So it's not just some Gody top.
[00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:16.880]   It's actually gives the guy some protection.
[00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:21.240]   And so now people want to think that no, this is some sort of alien space age material
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:22.480]   that Superman is wearing.
[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:24.400]   He's not just wearing like refer God's sake.
[00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:26.240]   So that fabric is made.
[00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:27.240]   Yes.
[00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:28.680]   So that's a that okay there you go.
[00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:33.760]   So it is a style informed by capability by technological capability.
[00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:35.920]   And the two work together.
[00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:37.960]   But styles change and things will change.
[00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:40.040]   And so some of this is style.
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:43.200]   You know, the other thing is that a smartphone isn't real life.
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:48.280]   And so you can you can use design to do things differently.
[00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:53.040]   Making it more like real life seems like the most simplistic way of helping people use
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:54.040]   it.
[00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:56.080]   There might be better, more sophisticated ways.
[00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:57.080]   And that's way.
[00:24:57.080 --> 00:25:00.920]   There's actually authentic school of design.
[00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:02.960]   The authentic, you mean digitally authentic.
[00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:03.960]   Yeah.
[00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:06.520]   It's like a digital medium.
[00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:07.920]   Let's be digitally authentic.
[00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:08.920]   It's like calculator apps.
[00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:10.720]   Why does a calculator app have to look like a calculate?
[00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:11.720]   Right.
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:13.520]   Probably the least efficient way of making a calculator app on a computer.
[00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:15.880]   And in the early days of Superman, they would have.
[00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:18.480]   But in the later days of Superman, now we can try something else.
[00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:20.480]   Well, and if you look at, you don't need.
[00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:25.280]   I believe it was propeller had put, you know, the app they have on the on the on the on the
[00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:26.280]   on the reason.
[00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:29.680]   You're talking about reason or no, there's an app on the iPad that is a mute.
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:30.680]   It creates music.
[00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:33.920]   I think I recommended it a couple of weeks ago, but it it is probably a month ago.
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:37.920]   But what's interesting about it is it does that completely like it doesn't look like any
[00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:39.960]   instrument and you can make music out of it.
[00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:47.200]   And yet propeller had first big product reason had a rack with cables that would swing the
[00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:49.000]   ultimate skeuomorphic design, right?
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.600]   It's sort of onboarding people because the theory was that people didn't really know
[00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:54.000]   how to deal with digital and you had to kind of help them there.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.160]   But now, you know, they were digital immigrants.
[00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:58.440]   You know, to everything that you could to make them feel at home.
[00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:03.040]   And now people are being born digitally native and they don't need those sort of handholding
[00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:04.560]   to get them onto the digital platform.
[00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:05.560]   I love it.
[00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:06.560]   I love it.
[00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:08.840]   All right, let's take a break.
[00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:10.880]   I presume there are other rumors.
[00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:12.400]   I know we're going to see new Macbooks.
[00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:18.760]   We got to see new Macbooks and I'm curious what Renee's heard with his ear to the ground.
[00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:24.760]   One of the one of the confirming facts is that you can't, you know, the stock has dwindled
[00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:27.400]   now with Macbooks.
[00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:31.480]   Which ones are not which ones can you not get anymore?
[00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:33.480]   I was the heirs last week.
[00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:34.480]   It's theirs.
[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:35.480]   Okay.
[00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:39.320]   So that would indicate probably a new air coming out.
[00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:40.560]   But we'll talk more about that in just a bit.
[00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:46.360]   You're watching Mac Break Weekly, Renee Ritchie, Andy Inaco, Alex Lindsey from Down Under.
[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:48.440]   Our show today brought to you by Squarespace.
[00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:52.000]   Squarespace is very design centered, design focused.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:57.080]   It's a site for people and hosting for people who want to create their own sites.
[00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:59.160]   You can find out more at squarespace.com.
[00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:02.520]   Their newest designs are very modern.
[00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:05.160]   And I think you're going to see how styles change.
[00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:09.560]   They've got in-house designers that are working all the time to add features, to add templates.
[00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:12.360]   They just added the momentum template, which is just gorgeous.
[00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:15.080]   It's a full bleed template.
[00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:16.760]   So your pictures go edge to edge.
[00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:18.160]   And you might say, "Well, wait a minute.
[00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:20.240]   What happens when I go from that 27-inch display?
[00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:21.920]   Look, that dog looks great on a full screen.
[00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:23.600]   But what about an iPhone?"
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:24.640]   Well, that's the beauty of it.
[00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:27.040]   Every design at Squarespace is mobile responsive.
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:33.080]   That means it automatically reformats to fit the screen that it's on.
[00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:34.960]   And your site always looks great.
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:36.640]   You don't have a separate mobile site.
[00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:39.280]   You just have a site looks great everywhere.
[00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:42.640]   That's called design functional design, really great stuff.
[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:44.360]   They have a new calendar feature.
[00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:49.840]   The events collection allows you to share schedule updates.
[00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:51.440]   I'm telling you, Squarespace is incredible.
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:53.240]   So they've got this great content management software.
[00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:55.520]   It's easy to use, easy to design.
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:56.800]   You don't have to be a coder.
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:28:02.240]   If you are, though, they have a developer platform that includes an IDE with syntax colored code
[00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:03.240]   and so forth.
[00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:05.280]   But you don't need to know that.
[00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:07.480]   It's all drag and drop.
[00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:08.680]   And then they've got the best hosting.
[00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:10.800]   It never goes down, always wonderful.
[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:15.480]   And best of all, you don't pay extra if suddenly your site gets popular.
[00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:16.480]   That's the worst thing.
[00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:21.120]   And most hosts, all of a sudden you get slashed, audited, or in the old days, dug or, you know,
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:22.120]   twitted.
[00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:24.760]   And suddenly you've used up all your bandwidth.
[00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:25.760]   We see it all the time.
[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:30.560]   Sites say, sorry, can't serve for the next two weeks because we're done or worse.
[00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:34.600]   They keep serving and you get a massive bill, not with Squarespace.
[00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:39.360]   With Squarespace, the unlimited plan, which is only, show it again, $16 a month when you
[00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:43.960]   buy a year plan, $20 if you go month to month.
[00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:46.240]   And yes, you can go month to month.
[00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:47.400]   Is unlimited bandwidth.
[00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:48.480]   You'll never get a bandwidth bill.
[00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:50.520]   You can be the most popular site in the world.
[00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:54.720]   Unlimited pages, galleries and blogs, unlimited contributors.
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:29:00.960]   You could create an iMore plus crackberry plus everything else for $16 a month.
[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:02.320]   You want to sell stuff, no problem.
[00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:05.800]   They've added commerce now for 24 bucks a month.
[00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:08.040]   And they don't take a chunk of your sales.
[00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:12.160]   You have unlimited physical or digital and/or digital products.
[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:14.720]   You get a mobile store, of course, inventory tracking.
[00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:17.960]   They even do things like calculate the tax, help you with shipping.
[00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:20.880]   Coupon controls mean you can say, hey, I'm going to be on Twitter.
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:22.320]   I'm going to do a 20% off deal.
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:23.440]   Here's the offer code.
[00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:24.440]   Set that up.
[00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:26.360]   Take you 30 seconds.
[00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:27.960]   I just think Squarespace is amazing.
[00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:30.480]   Now you don't have to take my word for it because without a credit card, you can try
[00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:31.480]   this right now.
[00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:34.480]   Just go to squarespace.com and click the get started button.
[00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:35.880]   You pick your template and get going.
[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:36.880]   Try that momentum template.
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:38.200]   Here's the beauty part.
[00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:39.200]   You import all your content.
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:42.160]   They've got importers for all the blogs into momentum.
[00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:43.200]   And you say, well, that's OK.
[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:44.200]   What else have they got?
[00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:49.200]   You pick a new template and it all just, boom, with a push of a button reformats.
[00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:51.520]   It's modern, folks.
[00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:52.520]   It's easy.
[00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:54.720]   Now, after a couple of weeks, you say, this is great.
[00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:56.720]   It's working for me and you decide to buy.
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:57.760]   Please use our offer code.
[00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:01.800]   That's when we'd ask you to use Mac break in the number five for the month of May.

[00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:06.720]   That way they know you heard it on Mac break weekly in the month of May.
[00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:07.720]   And we get credit for it.
[00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:11.000]   And you will get, as a thank you, 10% off.

[00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:14.000]   You're going to save a lot of money.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.280]   Mac break five the offer code.
[00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:16.280]   Please try it.
[00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:17.280]   Squarespace.com.
[00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:20.840]   Just keeping the back of your head when it's time for you to set up a new website, when
[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:21.760]   it's time for you to--
[00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:23.560]   I mean, there's lots of good reasons, too.
[00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:26.400]   Baby being born, a wedding.
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:30.160]   Ryan in Veronica, they used a professional wedding site and it was such a pain.
[00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:31.920]   They went to Squarespace, added it up and running.
[00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:34.240]   And the last time I talked to Ryan, he said, I think it's still up and running.
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:35.240]   Of course it is.
[00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:36.240]   It's always going to be.
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:36.960]   It lives forever.
[00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:38.640]   Squarespace.com.
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:40.600]   Mac break five is the offer code.
[00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:42.640]   We're talking about Mac and Tasha's.
[00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:44.240]   ReneeRitchie, iMore.com.
[00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:51.160]   You seem to be among the best connected blogs out there since the death of Think Secret.
[00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:55.400]   What rumors do we know?
[00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:56.400]   What do we know what don't we know?
[00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:59.080]   I think it's safe to say there'll be new MacBook Airs.
[00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:04.360]   There'll be something based on that Intel Haswell platform, which came out this week.
[00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:09.600]   Given the last WWDC, they had the Retina MacBook Pro and they had new MacBook Airs.
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:10.840]   The MacBook Airs are due and update.
[00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:13.080]   The Retina MacBook Pros are due and update.
[00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:15.240]   Haswell is in the pipeline.
[00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:16.800]   I haven't heard anything about iOS devices.
[00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:19.720]   I heard stuff about that early in April and that seemed to be delayed.
[00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:24.120]   I'm not delayed, but it seemed to not be ready to move forward.
[00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:28.720]   I would be really surprised if we didn't see new Macs with the Haswell chipset, which
[00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:33.560]   I'm really looking forward to because I love my Retina Mac, but the GPU is just not powerful
[00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:34.920]   enough for that screen.
[00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:38.120]   I will upgrade in a hot second if they announce the WWDC.
[00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:42.040]   I'm saving space on the credit card and on my desk for anything.
[00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:46.920]   Remember those days, Alex, that we'd be talking about whatever Apple has.
[00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:51.120]   You'd put it in an order with Travis down at the Mac store in San Francisco.
[00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:52.760]   Say, "I'll take two of each."
[00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:56.840]   Yeah, I don't know what it is, but I don't know what it is, but I won't.
[00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:59.080]   Give me one with the largest capacity.
[00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:00.920]   Yeah, just whatever.
[00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:03.920]   Remember, it was the largest capacity that's in the store.
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:04.920]   So there's a special one.
[00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:05.920]   Right.
[00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:06.920]   I don't care.
[00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:07.920]   I don't care.
[00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:08.920]   I don't care.
[00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:09.920]   No BTO for you.
[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:12.080]   But Haswell, the biggest difference Haswell will make is improved battery life.
[00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:15.920]   And I would love to see a MacBook Air with 10 hours.
[00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:19.360]   I would love to see retina, but I have a feeling that's not what we're going to see, right?
[00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:21.440]   You can never have too much battery, Leo.
[00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:22.640]   It's the one thing that we've proven.
[00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:27.760]   I guess I don't really think about battery that much, but I guess where I go in the world,
[00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:30.440]   I'm constantly conscious of where I'm going to plug in.
[00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:32.920]   Well, and that's kind of the irony because I never unplug.
[00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:34.320]   I mean, I don't really need battery life.
[00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:35.320]   I'm either here or at home.
[00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:36.640]   I'm always plugged in.
[00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:39.720]   But the times you travel, you want to be able to get in the plane.
[00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:42.920]   You're going to Australia, 20 hour flight.
[00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:46.280]   Maybe you have plugs in the seat, but you just would like to be able to do it for a while
[00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:47.280]   without having to plug in.
[00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:51.280]   It's so weird because in the airplanes, Air Canada has USB, but no Wi-Fi.
[00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:55.600]   American are able to have Wi-Fi, but no USB or power.
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:57.600]   Some of the press power is coming in.
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:01.200]   I think we're going to see power standard in a lot of at least, I mean, everything economy
[00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:02.200]   plus up.
[00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:05.320]   But I mean, often, I mean, I think a lot of times they're really, I think power in the
[00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:08.760]   next five years is going to be something that is in almost every seat.
[00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:10.240]   You know, for the, I think it's all.
[00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:11.240]   I think it knows this too.
[00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:12.240]   It's a live blogging.
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:13.720]   Sometimes they have power on ethernet.
[00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:14.720]   Sometimes they don't.
[00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:17.440]   And then you're, you're watching your battery go down while the guy on the stage is still
[00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:18.440]   talking and.
[00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:19.440]   Yeah.
[00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:23.000]   I mean, that's, as a matter of fact, that's one of the reasons why like I, I, I like the,
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.440]   the Samsung Galaxy because it has a pop up battery and I can essentially have 24 hour
[00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:29.920]   battery life with like $40 for the extra batteries.
[00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:33.840]   But I think that part of the problem is that you look at the devices that people are being
[00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:35.240]   trained to use every single day.
[00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:39.560]   And now people are using more and more tablets that because of their lower power requirements
[00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:45.440]   are sort of training them to get to not deal with power outlets for six to eight hours
[00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:46.960]   over the course of a workday.
[00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:52.200]   And so I don't think that I think the difference between a laptop that works for five hours
[00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:54.920]   and one that works for eight hours is huge.
[00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:59.880]   One that works eight hours and 10 hours is just as huge as one before that every hour
[00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:02.200]   above 10 is not, that's not quite necessary.
[00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:05.200]   But everybody really wants the, when you, when you mentioned them that this is a device
[00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:10.200]   that if it's charged up at the beginning of the day, you will not even have to think about
[00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:16.440]   finding the one seat at the Panera Bread that's near the power outlet.
[00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:22.120]   Because if this, I've, I have very few moments where I really wish ill upon a human being
[00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:23.760]   that I don't know anything about.
[00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:30.200]   But if I, if I, if I know that dude, all you're doing is you're reading a paperback book and
[00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:33.520]   you're sitting at the only table that's next to an outlet.
[00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:38.440]   Dude, I will buy you, I will buy you the entire chocolate Bobco over the, I'm talking about
[00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:40.880]   a $14 party Bobco over there.
[00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:45.320]   If you will just move one table over and let me sit, have you ever done that?
[00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:46.320]   I have never done that.
[00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:48.240]   I've never had the guts to do that.
[00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:52.480]   It was, there's a Bobcat in it for you.
[00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:56.640]   Maybe, maybe we should make that like a part of the, we'll add that to the social contract
[00:34:56.640 --> 00:35:00.720]   that if you are sitting next to a power outlet and you're not using that outlet, I will
[00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:05.520]   buy you a pastry item, let's say above $1.49 less than $4.
[00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:07.560]   The getchards are the same thing.
[00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:10.880]   It's just sometimes you really need power and there's just one guy sitting there at the
[00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:11.880]   plug and not doing anything.
[00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:13.400]   What is that Alex?
[00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:14.400]   Alex has the solution.
[00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:19.280]   So that this is something that I, I, I, I should make this my pick, but, but I, I carry
[00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:22.640]   something that looks like this at the almost any time I'm traveling.
[00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:23.640]   So this one had, this is, I don't know.
[00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:27.560]   So just to describe it for people listening, it's a, and I have one just like you plug it
[00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:32.400]   into the wall, it adds three power ports, but also two USB outlets for charging.
[00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:37.680]   Yeah, two, you're buying it now and the big ones that we all have one or you know, a,
[00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:38.680]   you know, a, a, a.
[00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:39.680]   This is Chad's.
[00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:40.680]   Oh, this is nice.
[00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:43.040]   Three going either direction, which is even smaller than that.
[00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:45.920]   And it doesn't, you know, the, the advantage of the cube, by the way, is that it works
[00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:47.400]   at 240 and one and one 10.
[00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:50.120]   The problem with this one is I brought it over to Australia and if I actually plugged
[00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:51.500]   it in, that smoke would come out of it.
[00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:54.740]   This is the one from a, Chad has the one from monsters, monster power.
[00:35:54.740 --> 00:35:55.980]   It wouldn't be a little too big.
[00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:58.060]   That's the, I do like the fact that it has a cord.
[00:35:58.060 --> 00:35:59.060]   Yeah.
[00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:01.140]   Because then you can hang it up with all, it's only got one USB port.
[00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:02.140]   Yeah.
[00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:08.540]   One thing is, is that almost nobody, if you have one with three or even two, almost nobody
[00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:12.100]   will argue with you if you walk over and you get kind of share on your face and you go,
[00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:16.940]   oh, is it okay if I just sit between the usual, the usual deal I offer because I use
[00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:18.420]   that monsters to go cable.
[00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:21.660]   The one, the one, the great things about it is that it is a little bit larger, but the
[00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:22.660]   outlets are spaced away.
[00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:23.660]   Right.
[00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:24.860]   So we'll have no problem putting power brick in there.
[00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:29.140]   And the usual thing I offer, especially if that guy looks like he could like really kick
[00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:33.300]   my butt if he's, you know, he's having a bad day, I will like actually approach holding
[00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:37.460]   this in my hand making a clear with their three outlets here, say, I, if you let me plug
[00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:41.140]   this in, I will let you have two of these outlets in exchange for the one outlet that
[00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:42.140]   you're using right now.
[00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:43.140]   Don't shoot.
[00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:44.140]   Don't shoot.
[00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:45.140]   I've got power.
[00:36:45.140 --> 00:36:46.140]   See power.
[00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:47.700]   And then you're not the guy who took the outlet.
[00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:51.220]   You're the guy that brought two extra outlets to the part allowed him to charge his phone
[00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:53.140]   and his, and his laptop at the same time.
[00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:54.140]   Right.
[00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:56.060]   There is never enough battery life.
[00:36:56.060 --> 00:36:59.940]   We've all got strategies for solving this problem.
[00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:03.540]   We'll having has well make enough of a difference that we won't have to wheel abandon this.
[00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:04.540]   No.
[00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:06.940]   So we've kind of, well, basically it's like spam.
[00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:08.180]   We never fix spam.
[00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:10.220]   We just figured out ways to not have to see it.
[00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:11.220]   Deferring the problem.
[00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:12.220]   We deferred the problem.
[00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:13.220]   Yeah.
[00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:16.700]   Well, but the, and, but the other thing worth noting is that Intel is really solidifying
[00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:19.540]   their position as one of the most influential companies out there.
[00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:21.260]   They're not just a parts supplier.
[00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:25.420]   They have the power to direct the motion and the direction of the industry.
[00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:29.100]   Every time that they've, every time that they've added a new processor, they have made it
[00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:34.900]   a little bit easier for low, for high power consumption devices to compete with low power
[00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:36.420]   consumption devices.
[00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:40.220]   And whereas two years ago, we were making fun of Intel based ultra books because okay,
[00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:43.460]   great, they're kind of thin, but they have three spinning fans.
[00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:47.900]   They last for two and a half hours, you know, on, on battery, but by largely by virtue of
[00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:51.020]   the fact that they have this new really cool optimized processor.
[00:37:51.020 --> 00:37:53.700]   Now they're getting closer and closer to MacBook Air specs.
[00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:59.380]   By the way, these, if you search Amazon, the power to go power strips from a 10 to 15 bucks
[00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:00.380]   are not expensive.
[00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:01.580]   Buying all of them.
[00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:02.580]   Yeah.
[00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:03.580]   Yeah.
[00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:04.900]   I own the Belkin, which is a little more expensive.
[00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:07.820]   And that's not as functional because it actually plugs right into the wall.
[00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:08.820]   It's a swivel.
[00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:10.700]   I've always bring that for travel, but I bring that for the hotel.
[00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:13.020]   So I'm going to have to get now an airport power store.
[00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:15.180]   You don't work very well on the flights, by the way.
[00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:16.700]   The, the, actually I bought it.
[00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:24.060]   I had to buy a 60 watt adapter because your 85 right now will turn your airport power
[00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:25.780]   off 70, 70 watt.
[00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:26.780]   Right.
[00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:27.780]   Right is the Mac.
[00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:28.780]   Here's a good one.
[00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:29.780]   Look at this.
[00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:34.900]   This is from Mac Ally portable power strip with USB 2.0 hub and charger.
[00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:35.900]   Thirty five bucks.
[00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:37.300]   This does it all.
[00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:39.020]   It's got five USB ports.
[00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:40.380]   Not seeing your screen.
[00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:41.460]   It's a, you're not seeing my screen.
[00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:42.460]   Oh, this is nice.
[00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:43.460]   This is, can you see it now?
[00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:44.460]   There you go.
[00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:45.460]   I want to see this.
[00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:46.460]   This is nice.
[00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:47.460]   I'm going to have to order this.
[00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:48.460]   Thirty five bucks.
[00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:49.460]   It's got a cord.
[00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:51.340]   It's only too prong.
[00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:53.340]   It's not grounded.
[00:38:53.340 --> 00:38:54.340]   Oh, you're right.
[00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:55.340]   It's not grounded.
[00:38:55.340 --> 00:38:56.500]   What the hell?
[00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:57.940]   What is wrong with them?
[00:38:57.940 --> 00:38:59.300]   Well, that's, that's okay.
[00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:02.580]   I still have one of those adapters I got from my grandma's house.
[00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:08.540]   Like the one that has the little metal tab for you to ground it to a cold water pipe.
[00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:09.540]   Yeah, that's, that's handy.
[00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:10.540]   I'll say this.
[00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:13.900]   Like you're, you're sometimes as a consumer, you really are influenced by design.
[00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:17.860]   One of the reasons why I bought that monster, uh, uh, outless to go is that the first time
[00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:24.060]   I saw that, wow, someone thought of having the little cord wrap around and then it plugs
[00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:25.060]   into itself.
[00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:26.580]   So it doesn't, isn't that cool?
[00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:30.100]   I, I want to give you $20 monster.
[00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:31.100]   Yeah.
[00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:32.100]   Here's a Mac.
[00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:33.100]   Here's a Mac ally.
[00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:34.100]   There's the monster for 15 bucks.
[00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:37.060]   We're, for those of you listening, we're just showing Amazon screens.
[00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:41.580]   Here's a Mac ally that has, uh, three prong, but see, it says not the court.
[00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:42.580]   I want the cord.
[00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:43.580]   Yeah.
[00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:48.700]   And also the, the, another factor is that when you have those two prongs or sticking side
[00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:52.780]   of outlet and the entire weight of that is dangling off the outlet, not all of these
[00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:55.180]   outlets can like hold that in place.
[00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:58.940]   Whereas if you have the, if it's a wire and it's a three prong, you get better connection
[00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:01.180]   and also better mechanical connection.
[00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:03.500]   We got to get quirky to workie.
[00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:06.940]   They, they just got to be the perfect portable power.
[00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:09.500]   Has had one job and they had not coming through.
[00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:12.780]   How can they not do that for us?
[00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:19.700]   Um, now I'm, now I'm gross to name it's on.com looking at affordable power adapters, but let's
[00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:26.300]   get back to rumors for a Mac, WWDC, which June 10th, it's a, it's two weeks from, from
[00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:27.300]   yesterday.
[00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:28.300]   What else?
[00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:32.140]   I guess one of the questions also is we had the mountain lion preview early in the year
[00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:34.260]   last year and there was a lot of stuff early in the year.
[00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:36.580]   There was, um, the education event.
[00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:40.340]   There was the mountain lion preview and this year there was no OS 10 preview and we heard
[00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:45.340]   that engineers went over to iOS to help get that ready in time and what that means for
[00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:50.660]   OS 10.9 because we should, if Apple sticks to their, their new yearly release schedule,
[00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:52.340]   we should be seeing 10.9 as well.
[00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:57.180]   Do we need, um, to be honest, do we need another, uh, OS 10?
[00:40:57.180 --> 00:41:00.020]   I'm, I'm pretty content with mountain lion.
[00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:02.100]   I would like them to decouple the built in apps.
[00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:06.780]   So we no longer have to wait for entire system updates to fix things like messages or, you
[00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:07.900]   know, anything that goes wrong.
[00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:09.580]   Any of the individual apps.
[00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:12.460]   They can't push out an update to messages.
[00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:13.460]   They haven't.
[00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:17.100]   I mean, on the, on iOS, they've never updated mail or Safari or anything out of the main
[00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:21.460]   product cycle and I don't know if they've done that on OS 10, but I don't remember,
[00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:25.220]   for example, specific, not OS tied messages dot app update.
[00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:26.220]   Huh.
[00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:27.220]   And Google does that now.
[00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:28.220]   I think Blackberry does that now.
[00:41:28.220 --> 00:41:29.580]   It'd be nice if Apple did that.
[00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:30.580]   Yeah.
[00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:32.580]   I know I don't remember ever seen that on iOS.
[00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:34.420]   I think I've seen that before on Mac OS.
[00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:38.620]   So I don't think it's quite as locked in, but it's, I still think that I think there's
[00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:41.740]   a progress, you know, the real reason to do it is there's a progression where we're merging
[00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:42.740]   the operating systems.
[00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:45.460]   And so 10 nine gets us closer to seven iOS.
[00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:50.140]   If I'm, if I'm Apple, the other thing I'm looking at is, is Windows eight and it's, you
[00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:53.300]   know, kind of being pummeled in the marketplace.
[00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:57.740]   And that is mostly getting pummeled because of the, of the merging of a desktop and a
[00:41:57.740 --> 00:41:58.740]   tablet.
[00:41:58.740 --> 00:41:59.740]   Yeah, but I think I'm probably trying to force it.
[00:41:59.740 --> 00:42:01.980]   So the whole thing is, is that what Windows did is just like, we're going to force you
[00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:02.980]   all down this path.
[00:42:02.980 --> 00:42:06.380]   But if you're looking at what Apple's doing over a series of years is that more of the
[00:42:06.380 --> 00:42:10.100]   icons look the same, when your power goes out on your laptop, it now looks like your
[00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:14.140]   iPhone, when you're, you know, like all these things are just, they're what they're not
[00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:17.820]   doing is trying to, what people don't like to do, what Apple got in trouble with, with
[00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:20.740]   Final Cut was just changing everything all the time.
[00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:21.740]   Yeah.
[00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:24.580]   Rather than, rather than the slow progression where you, you know, it's kind of like sneaking
[00:42:24.580 --> 00:42:25.980]   up on a horse where you, I'm not in hurry.
[00:42:25.980 --> 00:42:27.900]   I don't want him to sneak up on me.
[00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:30.940]   I'm going to kick him in the, I just think I don't, I don't think it's really wanted
[00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:31.940]   or not.
[00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:34.580]   I think it doesn't make sense to maintain two operating systems over a long period of time.
[00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:43.980]   But Apple's in a much tougher boat because they have created a system by which the latest
[00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:47.180]   operating system is the default operating system that makes it very, and they make it
[00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:51.500]   very difficult for someone to stick with the old operating system by putting requirements
[00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:53.940]   on the app store that require the brand new features.
[00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:59.380]   And so we're asked Microsoft, I use the word failure of Windows 8 and Windows 7 and Windows
[00:42:59.380 --> 00:43:04.540]   Vista advisedly because they really have about two years to allow a new operating system
[00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:08.780]   to grow whole because they have no problem with somebody sticking with Windows, with Windows
[00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:10.580]   7 or legacy systems.
[00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:15.020]   And they actually do know that there's, since they're selling so many to businesses, is
[00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:18.300]   going to take a while for them to certify a brand new operating system for whatever they're
[00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:19.300]   going to do it with.
[00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:23.020]   So they have a little bit more freedom to say, okay, people didn't, people really do want
[00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:24.180]   that start button.
[00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:25.180]   No problem.
[00:43:25.180 --> 00:43:27.420]   Well, next year we'll put, we'll make sure we put a start button back in.
[00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:31.540]   We're asked if Apple were to do something really, really radical and really steam off
[00:43:31.540 --> 00:43:34.300]   most of their users.
[00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:39.780]   Those users might find themselves in a position where I can't use the latest best apps anymore
[00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:42.580]   because I absolutely hate OS 10.9.
[00:43:42.580 --> 00:43:46.140]   There's something broken about it in terms of what my workflow is that now I can't really
[00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:47.820]   use and I want to stick with 10.8.
[00:43:47.820 --> 00:43:50.580]   But Apple's making it really difficult for me to stick with 10.8.
[00:43:50.580 --> 00:43:54.020]   And now here it is, my laptop is three years old right now and it's time for me to buy
[00:43:54.020 --> 00:43:55.020]   a new one.
[00:43:55.020 --> 00:43:57.660]   Well, just for the heck of it, let's take a look at what's going on on the Windows side.
[00:43:57.660 --> 00:44:00.500]   Let's see what's going on on other operating systems.
[00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:05.060]   So I mean, it's, I agree with you that there's going to be more of a merging of the minds.
[00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:11.940]   I'm not sure if we're that close to one operating system for everybody, but it's, Apple really
[00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:14.220]   has to be a little bit more ginger when they make those steps.
[00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:17.980]   Isn't it also, I mean, it's silly to say, well, we said we were going to do it every
[00:44:17.980 --> 00:44:19.940]   year, whether we need to or not update it.
[00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:23.300]   I mean, well, they don't think it's bound by that stuff.
[00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:26.980]   Yeah, they can say, hey, we said that, but there's nothing we're, you know, here's the
[00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:27.980]   spin.
[00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:29.720]   It's perfect.
[00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:30.720]   We could stop.
[00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:34.700]   No, no, we think this is the best operating system.
[00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:35.700]   10.8.5.1.2.
[00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:43.500]   The best ever thing that my understanding is, and this might not be a very good one, is
[00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:46.820]   that there's no real drive to merge iOS and OS 10.
[00:44:46.820 --> 00:44:50.740]   There is a drive to make sure that OS 10 looks enough like iOS so that whatever halo
[00:44:50.740 --> 00:44:55.700]   effect they have of people moving from iPhones and iPads to the Mac will be incredibly easy
[00:44:55.700 --> 00:44:57.300]   and incredibly familiar.
[00:44:57.300 --> 00:45:00.520]   But the architecture of OS 10 is going to stay the same.
[00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:04.640]   And then you sort of iOS will just increase, sorry, we'll just keep getting better and
[00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:07.560]   better until it subsumes more and more functionality.
[00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:12.360]   And then one day the need for OS 10 will drop to near zero, almost like how OS 10 replaced
[00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:14.960]   the previous generation, OS 9 and things.
[00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:17.520]   There won't be a convergence, but one will make the other obsolete.
[00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:18.520]   Absolutely.
[00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:21.080]   That's we've seen, I'll be getting back to Microsoft.
[00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:26.120]   All I have to do is look at how Microsoft launched Surface, the difficulties of merging
[00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:31.240]   a mobile operating system with a desktop operating system where you have two Surface
[00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:34.640]   RT and Surface Pro, they look very similar to each other.
[00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:40.720]   And the start screen is identical, but you're dealing with an operating system now, Windows
[00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:45.620]   RT that really can't do all the heavy lifting that Windows 7 can do.
[00:45:45.620 --> 00:45:50.460]   And so that's why it's not really a good buy for very many people, especially in a world
[00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:54.060]   that has an iPad in it and so many really great tablet apps for it.
[00:45:54.060 --> 00:45:58.660]   And they've learned so much, the architecture for iOS was built so much later than OS 10
[00:45:58.660 --> 00:46:02.180]   and they're probably going to want to continue building on that and not have to keep around
[00:46:02.180 --> 00:46:03.380]   OS 10's core.
[00:46:03.380 --> 00:46:06.820]   You know, on all the decisions, good and bad, they made a decade ago.
[00:46:06.820 --> 00:46:11.060]   Well, is the issue perhaps that they did take, I mean, this was only a rumor that they
[00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:14.140]   did take developers off OS 10 to work on iOS.
[00:46:14.140 --> 00:46:17.660]   Does that mean that we won't get an OS 10 merely because they don't have the horses
[00:46:17.660 --> 00:46:19.660]   to do it?
[00:46:19.660 --> 00:46:20.660]   What's in your wish lab?
[00:46:20.660 --> 00:46:22.540]   I mean, the interesting thing to me is instead of thinking about whether we'll get it or
[00:46:22.540 --> 00:46:26.180]   not or what are the obvious steps like there's things that you could point to for years
[00:46:26.180 --> 00:46:29.940]   in iOS and say Apple really, Apple really needs to handle multitasking.
[00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:30.940]   They really need to do something better.
[00:46:30.940 --> 00:46:31.940]   Right.
[00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:32.940]   But there's nothing like that anymore.
[00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:34.260]   I don't think that's my point.
[00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:37.420]   That was my starting point was that they don't need to update it.
[00:46:37.420 --> 00:46:38.940]   So why why even bother?
[00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:43.980]   Well, there's always going to be there's always the the back of the drawer sort of features
[00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:46.580]   that have been rattling around inside Apple for years and years and years.
[00:46:46.580 --> 00:46:51.540]   All the features that both actual usable features and fixes that they've been meaning to get
[00:46:51.540 --> 00:46:53.180]   to for a long, long time.
[00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:55.660]   But now they've announced iCloud.
[00:46:55.660 --> 00:46:57.220]   So now iCloud really has to work.
[00:46:57.220 --> 00:46:59.980]   So they're not going to work on that simple esoteric feature that will only make things
[00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:06.060]   a little bit more stable but won't be noticed front face and center by the actual users.
[00:47:06.060 --> 00:47:07.580]   So I'll get there.
[00:47:07.580 --> 00:47:11.020]   I really think that the next time we're going to see a really major update like in terms
[00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:14.340]   of wow, this is a totally different thing from what I've used it before.
[00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:17.820]   I really think it's going to be motivated by brand new hardware and opportunity that
[00:47:17.820 --> 00:47:23.980]   they have either in manufacturing or in display technology or in just simply a newly architected
[00:47:23.980 --> 00:47:29.940]   CPUs that allows them to really not just make a step forward but to really reinvent
[00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:30.940]   Mac OS.
[00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:35.700]   I don't think right now there's anything that's being released in 2013 or even early 2014
[00:47:35.700 --> 00:47:38.140]   that would allow them to make that kind of really big step.
[00:47:38.140 --> 00:47:40.940]   Here's a quote from our chatroom web 2762.
[00:47:40.940 --> 00:47:43.020]   I'm presuming this is job speaking.
[00:47:43.020 --> 00:47:46.980]   Teddy told me the most important idea in advertising Teddy would be Ted Chiat I presume
[00:47:46.980 --> 00:47:47.980]   is new.
[00:47:47.980 --> 00:47:49.500]   It creates an itch.
[00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:52.500]   You simply put your product in there as a kind of Calamine lotion.
[00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:54.580]   It certainly sells products.
[00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:55.980]   You want the new one.
[00:47:55.980 --> 00:47:57.300]   I think they'll certainly be a 10.
[00:47:57.300 --> 00:47:59.140]   I mean, we've had 10.9 in server logs.
[00:47:59.140 --> 00:48:01.060]   We've had iOS seven and server long time.
[00:48:01.060 --> 00:48:02.060]   Never mind.
[00:48:02.060 --> 00:48:03.060]   It's mad men.
[00:48:03.060 --> 00:48:05.060]   Don Draper speaking.
[00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:06.060]   Okay, go ahead.
[00:48:06.060 --> 00:48:07.060]   Absolutely.
[00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:08.900]   They're absolutely working on 10.9.
[00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:11.220]   The question is what is how big will it be?
[00:48:11.220 --> 00:48:14.340]   Will they fix things like full screen apps on multiple monitors?
[00:48:14.340 --> 00:48:15.860]   Will they fix messages?
[00:48:15.860 --> 00:48:19.340]   Will there be a new finder that's finally written in a modern programming language?
[00:48:19.340 --> 00:48:21.140]   Is all these things they can tackle?
[00:48:21.140 --> 00:48:23.340]   Is finder how to date?
[00:48:23.340 --> 00:48:24.340]   Yeah.
[00:48:24.340 --> 00:48:28.540]   Didn't they cocoaize it already or is it not cocoa?
[00:48:28.540 --> 00:48:29.540]   I think it is.
[00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:30.540]   I think it is.
[00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:31.540]   And I think it's multitasking.
[00:48:31.540 --> 00:48:33.540]   I think they did fix finder with 10.9.
[00:48:33.540 --> 00:48:36.940]   I don't know what, seven, six.
[00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:39.820]   I think it was a fairly recent change.
[00:48:39.820 --> 00:48:42.540]   It was carbon for a long time.
[00:48:42.540 --> 00:48:47.100]   I would have to turn to my research assistant, Google, to verify it.
[00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:51.860]   But I remember some big announcement saying that we finally got the last bits of it.
[00:48:51.860 --> 00:48:54.380]   It's been a hybrid for years and years and years.
[00:48:54.380 --> 00:48:55.900]   I think that they only fairly recently.
[00:48:55.900 --> 00:48:58.660]   No leopard was the first cocoa based finder.
[00:48:58.660 --> 00:48:59.660]   Okay.
[00:48:59.660 --> 00:49:02.060]   But it is kind of, you're always going to need a file navigator.
[00:49:02.060 --> 00:49:05.460]   So long as you're going to be exposing the file directories to the user, you're going
[00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:07.420]   to need to have something as simple as that.
[00:49:07.420 --> 00:49:10.940]   But I think that the time has long passed for Apple to give us something that's a little
[00:49:10.940 --> 00:49:15.420]   bit more useful than that, to make the default way of navigating something like Siri, something
[00:49:15.420 --> 00:49:17.060]   like, you find your feels pretty crappy.
[00:49:17.060 --> 00:49:21.900]   Give me the word document that I opened last week and it had something to do with circuses
[00:49:21.900 --> 00:49:22.900]   in it.
[00:49:22.900 --> 00:49:23.900]   And oh, okay.
[00:49:23.900 --> 00:49:24.900]   It's probably this one.
[00:49:24.900 --> 00:49:25.900]   Great.
[00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:26.900]   There's natural language.
[00:49:26.900 --> 00:49:27.900]   And there's all sorts of things.
[00:49:27.900 --> 00:49:29.540]   Like a FaceTime is still single user.
[00:49:29.540 --> 00:49:31.660]   There's no FaceTime conference calling yet.
[00:49:31.660 --> 00:49:33.740]   There's a lot of features that would demo very well.
[00:49:33.740 --> 00:49:36.380]   And it's always nice to think of what's Apple going to show in the commercial because
[00:49:36.380 --> 00:49:38.380]   those will be the big tent pole features.
[00:49:38.380 --> 00:49:41.620]   And there's certain things that will demo really well that they could easily.
[00:49:41.620 --> 00:49:45.220]   Google's really doing great with this new contextual voice search.
[00:49:45.220 --> 00:49:48.060]   And I would, I would, I would got to think that that's something that Apple could build
[00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:51.060]   into spotlight and put Siri in the desktop.
[00:49:51.060 --> 00:49:54.340]   I think that's, I think it's a lot of work and I think it's a lot of engineers they don't
[00:49:54.340 --> 00:49:55.340]   have.
[00:49:55.340 --> 00:49:56.900]   They'd like to, but they can.
[00:49:56.900 --> 00:49:57.900]   Is that what you're saying?
[00:49:57.900 --> 00:49:58.900]   I don't know.
[00:49:58.900 --> 00:49:59.900]   I don't know if they can, they can do that.
[00:49:59.900 --> 00:50:02.460]   I think that I think one thing that they can do with, with what they have with FaceTime
[00:50:02.460 --> 00:50:06.860]   is I do think Google was now really taking the lead in the, I want to communicate with
[00:50:06.860 --> 00:50:11.700]   anyone, however I want to communicate with them, whether it's voice or video or text
[00:50:11.700 --> 00:50:15.580]   and merging that experience and moving it away from cellular and everything else.
[00:50:15.580 --> 00:50:18.900]   And I think that, and we've talked about this before, but I think Apple has to sometime
[00:50:18.900 --> 00:50:22.180]   in the near future get to a point where I can do the same thing I was doing where I
[00:50:22.180 --> 00:50:25.620]   was, when I'm calling over Wi-Fi and I, I'm much more sensitive about it when I'm here
[00:50:25.620 --> 00:50:29.740]   in, in Australia where I just want people to have my phone number that I have in the
[00:50:29.740 --> 00:50:32.220]   US and when they call it, it comes to me over Wi-Fi.
[00:50:32.220 --> 00:50:35.220]   If I'm connected, if they're on an iPhone and I'm on my phone, it's all Wi-Fi.
[00:50:35.220 --> 00:50:37.780]   Have you guys done, have you guys done this yet?
[00:50:37.780 --> 00:50:40.100]   This is, can you see my screen?
[00:50:40.100 --> 00:50:43.620]   This is the Google, the new Chrome.
[00:50:43.620 --> 00:50:44.620]   Who is Andy Inako?
[00:50:44.620 --> 00:50:48.500]   Oh, I'm not going to like this.
[00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:49.500]   No internet connection.
[00:50:49.500 --> 00:50:50.500]   Well, there you go.
[00:50:50.500 --> 00:50:51.500]   And that's what's wrong.
[00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:54.860]   Well, you know, they, they probably saw last week's show when I lost my gig of Ethan.
[00:50:54.860 --> 00:50:58.300]   Who is Andy Inako?
[00:50:58.300 --> 00:50:59.300]   Who is his Indian Echo?
[00:50:59.300 --> 00:51:00.300]   No, that's wrong.
[00:51:00.300 --> 00:51:01.300]   Let's try it again.
[00:51:01.300 --> 00:51:03.300]   Who is Andy Inako?
[00:51:03.300 --> 00:51:06.140]   Listen.
[00:51:06.140 --> 00:51:10.980]   According to Wikipedia, Andy Inako is a 47 year old technology journalist for the Chicago
[00:51:10.980 --> 00:51:13.700]   Sun Times and tech author.
[00:51:13.700 --> 00:51:14.700]   Pretty cool, huh?
[00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:16.500]   Now, one thing was wrong.
[00:51:16.500 --> 00:51:19.340]   Well, anyway, you're a little older, but that's okay.
[00:51:19.340 --> 00:51:21.100]   So our little younger, I'm not sure.
[00:51:21.100 --> 00:51:22.620]   Google takes 10 years off.
[00:51:22.620 --> 00:51:23.620]   Yeah.
[00:51:23.620 --> 00:51:27.260]   So I, no, but I think that that is the beginning of something significant and that's coming
[00:51:27.260 --> 00:51:28.260]   from my browser.
[00:51:28.260 --> 00:51:30.500]   Wouldn't that be something spotless?
[00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:32.620]   That's Siri's voice for crying out loud.
[00:51:32.620 --> 00:51:33.940]   Well, it's licensed from nuance.
[00:51:33.940 --> 00:51:37.420]   I know, I know, I know, but I'm just saying that's what the operating system, that's where
[00:51:37.420 --> 00:51:39.420]   the operating system used to go.
[00:51:39.420 --> 00:51:40.420]   Yeah.
[00:51:40.420 --> 00:51:41.420]   I think that's pretty amazing.
[00:51:41.420 --> 00:51:42.420]   I think that's pretty amazing.
[00:51:42.420 --> 00:51:44.100]   We're in here for a good interview.
[00:51:44.100 --> 00:51:46.340]   technology for, for WWDC.
[00:51:46.340 --> 00:51:48.460]   We haven't really heard a lot of watches.
[00:51:48.460 --> 00:51:55.060]   I think the TV and the watcher just bogus, bogus, full of bogusness.
[00:51:55.060 --> 00:51:56.580]   Wall Street demands a new product.
[00:51:56.580 --> 00:51:59.900]   Apple is doomed unless they release a new product every six months whole new category
[00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:00.900]   every year.
[00:52:00.900 --> 00:52:01.900]   So Apple, let's not.
[00:52:01.900 --> 00:52:02.900]   Wait a minute.
[00:52:02.900 --> 00:52:05.220]   Didn't Tim Cook tell all things D?
[00:52:05.220 --> 00:52:06.700]   We've got lots of new categories.
[00:52:06.700 --> 00:52:08.460]   Some, what did he say exactly?
[00:52:08.460 --> 00:52:11.020]   No more, more than one new category coming this year.
[00:52:11.020 --> 00:52:14.140]   Refrigerators and I think Apple refrigerator be.
[00:52:14.140 --> 00:52:16.220]   We've got a new category of Mac.
[00:52:16.220 --> 00:52:18.420]   We're going to make it in Texas, right?
[00:52:18.420 --> 00:52:19.420]   Yeah.
[00:52:19.420 --> 00:52:20.420]   That's this year.
[00:52:20.420 --> 00:52:21.420]   Both of those were this year.
[00:52:21.420 --> 00:52:25.900]   I still think that the Texas Mac, I still think it's going to be some, some kind of Mac
[00:52:25.900 --> 00:52:26.900]   pro server.
[00:52:26.900 --> 00:52:27.900]   It's a pro.
[00:52:27.900 --> 00:52:28.900]   It's a modular pro.
[00:52:28.900 --> 00:52:29.900]   Something low yield.
[00:52:29.900 --> 00:52:30.900]   Yeah.
[00:52:30.900 --> 00:52:32.900]   It's going to have higher margins.
[00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:33.900]   Yeah.
[00:52:33.900 --> 00:52:35.060]   You know if you're going to do it here.
[00:52:35.060 --> 00:52:37.140]   So I think that, I think that, that's good for us.
[00:52:37.140 --> 00:52:40.780]   I mean, for the, those of us who've been waiting for the truck.
[00:52:40.780 --> 00:52:45.860]   And new categories, maybe I just, I know, I know Renee's adamant that though, I watch
[00:52:45.860 --> 00:52:46.860]   his reel.
[00:52:46.860 --> 00:52:50.020]   Because you know, they move it out of prototyping and it's in the product pipeline, but I have
[00:52:50.020 --> 00:52:53.500]   no idea how far along it is or, you know, and you can cancel things up until they're
[00:52:53.500 --> 00:52:54.500]   announced.
[00:52:54.500 --> 00:52:55.740]   Apple's very good about not pre-announcing.
[00:52:55.740 --> 00:52:59.380]   So until they see up on stage and hold it up, nothing's for certain.
[00:52:59.380 --> 00:53:03.660]   Well, Cook is, somebody in the chat, I'm saying Cook takes the stage tonight on All Things
[00:53:03.660 --> 00:53:04.660]   D11.
[00:53:04.660 --> 00:53:07.460]   There will be no new product announcements at All Things D.
[00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:11.900]   No, but, but he might, he's been dropping hints like crazy.
[00:53:11.900 --> 00:53:16.580]   We need to because they've been such a long time without product announcements and they're
[00:53:16.580 --> 00:53:20.500]   getting so much attention from Wall Street that his job as CEO as its job is to, you
[00:53:20.500 --> 00:53:22.020]   know, raise money in a sure Wall Street.
[00:53:22.020 --> 00:53:24.020]   And that's what he's going to do when he's given a microphone.
[00:53:24.020 --> 00:53:30.020]   ABC, this is such a big story that Joanna Stern on ABC is live blogging his All Things
[00:53:30.020 --> 00:53:34.140]   D appearance tonight.
[00:53:34.140 --> 00:53:35.780]   That's hysterical.
[00:53:35.780 --> 00:53:38.260]   That is how that is how this ridiculous this has become.
[00:53:38.260 --> 00:53:43.620]   Well, I think part of it is that, you know, Wall Street keeps on going crazy and Apple
[00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:48.340]   is seems to have this kind of almost smug air to them like, yeah, it's okay, but you
[00:53:48.340 --> 00:53:49.500]   know, we're working on it.
[00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:52.620]   You know, like they're not, they don't seem like they're concerned at all.
[00:53:52.620 --> 00:53:56.460]   It's not like they're, you know, they, you know, like they've got something up their
[00:53:56.460 --> 00:53:57.460]   sleeve.
[00:53:57.460 --> 00:54:01.100]   I mean, that's what it feels like when you see their reactions is that they feel like
[00:54:01.100 --> 00:54:04.820]   they have, and of course they may just be projecting, but it definitely feels like something's
[00:54:04.820 --> 00:54:05.820]   coming.
[00:54:05.820 --> 00:54:08.860]   I honestly don't believe that they would make any product that they didn't completely
[00:54:08.860 --> 00:54:13.460]   100% believe in because they have, I mean, they have, they have the one thing that they
[00:54:13.460 --> 00:54:18.300]   can always put the Nyan, yeah, thing in their back pocket, which is here are the numbers.
[00:54:18.300 --> 00:54:20.140]   Here's how much we sold last quarter.
[00:54:20.140 --> 00:54:22.060]   Here's how much we sold the quarter before that.
[00:54:22.060 --> 00:54:24.620]   Now, is that this number significantly higher than that number?
[00:54:24.620 --> 00:54:28.700]   Drop the mic, walk off the stage, two pack fades back into from the 3D.
[00:54:28.700 --> 00:54:32.260]   Yeah, but this is Cara Swisher and Walt Mossberg interrogating him.
[00:54:32.260 --> 00:54:34.940]   He doesn't have control of the pace of the flow tonight.
[00:54:34.940 --> 00:54:39.660]   So, but I do think it's reasonable given the things that he has said in the last month
[00:54:39.660 --> 00:54:42.060]   or so that more tidbits will drop.
[00:54:42.060 --> 00:54:43.860]   I don't think there'll be any announcements of any kind.
[00:54:43.860 --> 00:54:44.860]   Why would they, why would they?
[00:54:44.860 --> 00:54:45.860]   You'll pull some threads, Leo.
[00:54:45.860 --> 00:54:48.540]   He'll pull on some threads, not all the way.
[00:54:48.540 --> 00:54:49.540]   Yeah.
[00:54:49.540 --> 00:54:50.540]   Little more out.
[00:54:50.540 --> 00:54:51.540]   Little areas of interest.
[00:54:51.540 --> 00:54:56.340]   I can't believe that all these gadget blogs are live blogging this tonight.
[00:54:56.340 --> 00:54:57.340]   That is amazing.
[00:54:57.340 --> 00:55:01.740]   It's the first time Ten Cook has been on a stage that was outside of an investor sort
[00:55:01.740 --> 00:55:03.300]   of experience all year.
[00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:07.460]   I mean, people are thirsting for him to say something at this point.
[00:55:07.460 --> 00:55:09.260]   Let's discuss this though.
[00:55:09.260 --> 00:55:15.340]   Let's say that they do intend to introduce and I watched this year.
[00:55:15.340 --> 00:55:19.820]   Do they do the iPad thing and saying we're going to show it off and then tell you what
[00:55:19.820 --> 00:55:25.700]   day it's going to be available and use those six weeks to build up just incredible lines
[00:55:25.700 --> 00:55:30.220]   around the block, camping for two weeks, hype, or is it going to be and it's available
[00:55:30.220 --> 00:55:34.780]   today and they announced it in September, which do you think they would do?
[00:55:34.780 --> 00:55:37.180]   One question is do they need to have CC approval on a watch?
[00:55:37.180 --> 00:55:38.780]   Because they do because it has a radio.
[00:55:38.780 --> 00:55:43.540]   If it's a new advice that they'd have to do that, it doesn't necessarily, I asked someone
[00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:46.860]   about this about an iPad a while ago.
[00:55:46.860 --> 00:55:50.300]   If it is sufficiently redundant, they wouldn't necessarily have to do it.
[00:55:50.300 --> 00:55:55.580]   If it uses a technology or a component that's already been used, they can make the case
[00:55:55.580 --> 00:55:57.980]   that no, we've already established that this is okay.
[00:55:57.980 --> 00:55:58.980]   It's an iPod.
[00:55:58.980 --> 00:56:05.340]   It's an iPod and there's no attention to the strappy thing around it.
[00:56:05.340 --> 00:56:08.940]   I think the interesting thing is if there's a developer platform attached to it, one of
[00:56:08.940 --> 00:56:13.420]   the reasons the iPad was introduced early was to give developers several weeks head start
[00:56:13.420 --> 00:56:18.860]   to make apps so that Apple could announce a large and voluptuous app store when the product
[00:56:18.860 --> 00:56:19.860]   was shipped.
[00:56:19.860 --> 00:56:25.820]   If the iWatch is more like an Apple TV where it's select channel partners and very carefully
[00:56:25.820 --> 00:56:28.580]   controlled by Apple, then they don't need to give developers any time.
[00:56:28.580 --> 00:56:32.620]   But if they do want them to be able to support even just a widgeting system of some kind,
[00:56:32.620 --> 00:56:34.140]   then they'll need to give them more runway.
[00:56:34.140 --> 00:56:38.460]   I still think that a watch is such a stupid and product that nobody's going to watch once
[00:56:38.460 --> 00:56:43.140]   they try it, that they better pre-sell it like crazy so they can really maximize the sale.
[00:56:43.140 --> 00:56:45.860]   If you could do your Google now stuff on your watch, you'd be happy.
[00:56:45.860 --> 00:56:46.860]   I would.
[00:56:46.860 --> 00:56:50.660]   Actually, I'm sorry that Renee and I were talking over that.
[00:56:50.660 --> 00:56:54.500]   We're going to want to isolate that statement so that it could be used in remixes later
[00:56:54.500 --> 00:56:55.500]   on.
[00:56:55.500 --> 00:56:57.900]   So if you could, we'll go 3-2-1 and you say the exact same things.
[00:56:57.900 --> 00:56:59.500]   We'll have nice clean audio of that.
[00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:03.500]   Not that we'll use it against you later, but we might.
[00:57:03.500 --> 00:57:06.700]   3-2-1.
[00:57:06.700 --> 00:57:11.860]   I would get rid of the watch that I'm quite happy with right now in a heartbeat for something
[00:57:11.860 --> 00:57:13.940]   I have a pebble and I am not impressed.
[00:57:13.940 --> 00:57:14.940]   I don't wear it anymore.
[00:57:14.940 --> 00:57:16.420]   Well, see, I won't be a pebble.
[00:57:16.420 --> 00:57:17.940]   That's what everyone said about.
[00:57:17.940 --> 00:57:19.500]   Why would anyone want to?
[00:57:19.500 --> 00:57:21.660]   How can you build a new phone that's going to work?
[00:57:21.660 --> 00:57:22.660]   I mean, because it's going to be a good thing.
[00:57:22.660 --> 00:57:23.660]   Well, I carried a blackberry.
[00:57:23.660 --> 00:57:24.660]   Happy to have it.
[00:57:24.660 --> 00:57:27.060]   But once the iPhone came out, I was happy to replace it.
[00:57:27.060 --> 00:57:30.060]   Yeah, but how many tablets were you happy with before the iPad came out?
[00:57:30.060 --> 00:57:31.060]   Yeah, I bought a few.
[00:57:31.060 --> 00:57:34.460]   How many screen devices were you happy with before the iPhone came out?
[00:57:34.460 --> 00:57:38.540]   It's like, I do think that there, I've been trying to gauge my own interest to my own
[00:57:38.540 --> 00:57:40.740]   excitement about an Apple Watch.
[00:57:40.740 --> 00:57:45.540]   But I find that when I place myself in an alternate future in which Apple is saying,
[00:57:45.540 --> 00:57:49.420]   this is a wristwatch that does cool things, but we decided to make a cool wristwatch,
[00:57:49.420 --> 00:57:51.220]   I get really excited about it.
[00:57:51.220 --> 00:57:56.580]   When I hear them trying to explain that this is a brand new category of device, the likes
[00:57:56.580 --> 00:58:00.340]   of which have never been, we removed every pain point of wearing a watch.
[00:58:00.340 --> 00:58:04.100]   I think, oh, so it's going to be $300 and it's kind of kind of worked, but not really
[00:58:04.100 --> 00:58:06.620]   worked incredibly well.
[00:58:06.620 --> 00:58:11.740]   I do like the idea of a watch that runs iOS that gets a couple of weeks of battery life
[00:58:11.740 --> 00:58:16.700]   at least and is primarily a timepiece and does only articulates its screen in ways that
[00:58:16.700 --> 00:58:20.140]   make sense for someone going like this for about five seconds.
[00:58:20.140 --> 00:58:22.500]   And it may not be called a watch.
[00:58:22.500 --> 00:58:25.900]   Sorry, I watch is just an easy, the same way the iPhone isn't really a phone, but phone
[00:58:25.900 --> 00:58:29.420]   makes it so understandable to the mainstream and I watch may not be a watch, but the term
[00:58:29.420 --> 00:58:33.740]   watch or even if they just call it an iPod nano generation X, it just makes it, it's
[00:58:33.740 --> 00:58:36.780]   just an easy way for people to refer to it for now and might be an easy way for Apple
[00:58:36.780 --> 00:58:40.860]   to market it in the future, but it would be a new thing nickname in our chat room says,
[00:58:40.860 --> 00:58:42.340]   it's I love this.
[00:58:42.340 --> 00:58:43.500]   It's an iPod.
[00:58:43.500 --> 00:58:44.780]   It's a timepiece.
[00:58:44.780 --> 00:58:46.780]   It's a thing you wear on your wrist.
[00:58:46.780 --> 00:58:47.780]   Are you getting it?
[00:58:47.780 --> 00:58:48.780]   It's an iPod.
[00:58:48.780 --> 00:58:49.780]   It's a timepiece.
[00:58:49.780 --> 00:58:51.340]   It's a thing you wear on your wrist.
[00:58:51.340 --> 00:58:53.540]   It doesn't have the same.
[00:58:53.540 --> 00:58:54.540]   It needs to know.
[00:58:54.540 --> 00:58:55.540]   We need to do that.
[00:58:55.540 --> 00:58:56.540]   We need to do that.
[00:58:56.540 --> 00:58:59.900]   Do we think Apple would ever go after like the glass market?
[00:58:59.900 --> 00:59:00.900]   Look at this.
[00:59:00.900 --> 00:59:06.700]   And this is the most recent Apple ad the music ad.
[00:59:06.700 --> 00:59:07.700]   What is that?
[00:59:07.700 --> 00:59:09.620]   Oh, dear Lord.
[00:59:09.620 --> 00:59:10.620]   What is that?
[00:59:10.620 --> 00:59:12.100]   The guy's tapping on the table.
[00:59:12.100 --> 00:59:13.780]   He's got headphones coming out of something.
[00:59:13.780 --> 00:59:15.140]   Oh, I guess it's something on his lap.
[00:59:15.140 --> 00:59:17.300]   He's wearing something that Apple would never design or let's not.
[00:59:17.300 --> 00:59:21.780]   I know if it's that, you know, no, no, the new secret product is the tattoo on his left
[00:59:21.780 --> 00:59:22.780]   forearm.
[00:59:22.780 --> 00:59:23.780]   Now that's not forgot.
[00:59:23.780 --> 00:59:27.580]   We gave a random actor our watch and let him use it in a commercial and then didn't
[00:59:27.580 --> 00:59:28.580]   remove it in post production.
[00:59:28.580 --> 00:59:32.620]   Well, that's a big mistake because we're paying attention to this stuff now.
[00:59:32.620 --> 00:59:36.540]   Apple is very impish that way where they like to sort of have these hidden Easter eggs
[00:59:36.540 --> 00:59:38.900]   about teasing future products.
[00:59:38.900 --> 00:59:42.940]   Remember when like, remember when like everyone was doing like the forensic analysis on I
[00:59:42.940 --> 00:59:49.820]   think the Martin Scorsese, a Siri ad saying, Oh, do you notice that the aspect ratio of
[00:59:49.820 --> 00:59:53.140]   the phone he's holding is not correct for an iPhone 4s?
[00:59:53.140 --> 00:59:54.780]   Actually, yes, it is.
[00:59:54.780 --> 00:59:57.180]   He's just not holding it directly.
[00:59:57.180 --> 01:00:02.220]   Apple would not forget that he gave a production sample of an unannounced product.
[01:00:02.220 --> 01:00:03.220]   They would really.
[01:00:03.220 --> 01:00:04.220]   Yeah.
[01:00:04.220 --> 01:00:05.220]   Okay.
[01:00:05.220 --> 01:00:06.220]   Anything stop it.
[01:00:06.220 --> 01:00:08.300]   Dude, dude, that's a Dell move.
[01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:10.460]   That's not an Apple move.
[01:00:10.460 --> 01:00:11.460]   Okay.
[01:00:11.460 --> 01:00:14.500]   Well, let's take a break and come back.
[01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:16.660]   You could tell me why I would want an Apple watch.
[01:00:16.660 --> 01:00:17.660]   Maybe it's not a watch.
[01:00:17.660 --> 01:00:21.500]   It's just something you wear on your wrist that reminds you of a watch.
[01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:25.700]   A little bit of category, but it does something so much more and I'd like to know what that
[01:00:25.700 --> 01:00:27.700]   is, but don't tell me yet because we're going to take a break.
[01:00:27.700 --> 01:00:28.700]   Okay.
[01:00:28.700 --> 01:00:29.700]   Let's go.
[01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:31.500]   We're going to talk about Gazelle.
[01:00:31.500 --> 01:00:33.360]   Actually, this is a perfectly appropriate time.
[01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:34.560]   We know something.
[01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:39.100]   We know something is happening and we know that may involve things you want to buy.
[01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:43.540]   We also know that you may want to get rid of old things that are no longer shiny.
[01:00:43.540 --> 01:00:45.620]   That's what Gazelle was made for.
[01:00:45.620 --> 01:00:46.980]   I had somebody call me on the radio show.
[01:00:46.980 --> 01:00:50.820]   I don't want to go to all the trouble to eBay, but I got this phone.
[01:00:50.820 --> 01:00:56.380]   I said, very simple, G-A-Z-E-L-L-E Gazelle.com.
[01:00:56.380 --> 01:00:57.380]   They'll buy it from you.
[01:00:57.380 --> 01:00:59.340]   In fact, they'll give you a very good price.
[01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:03.340]   $10 extra right now for the iPhone 4S because they know people are going to definitely be
[01:01:03.340 --> 01:01:05.220]   looking for something.
[01:01:05.220 --> 01:01:08.140]   The thing is, this is not a commitment to sell, by the way.
[01:01:08.140 --> 01:01:12.220]   This is merely getting a quote from Gazelle that's good for 30 days on any of these items.
[01:01:12.220 --> 01:01:13.220]   They've added some new tablets.
[01:01:13.220 --> 01:01:15.860]   Look at all the new tablets they take now.
[01:01:15.860 --> 01:01:21.420]   Not just the iPad, but also Samsung, Google Nexus, Kindle Fire, Surface.
[01:01:21.420 --> 01:01:23.820]   Had enough of that Surface and Asus tablet.
[01:01:23.820 --> 01:01:25.660]   Hey, just chat, just see, because I broke my Surface.
[01:01:25.660 --> 01:01:29.500]   I wonder, they probably won't give me any money for a broken Surface RT.
[01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:30.740]   Yeah, probably.
[01:01:30.740 --> 01:01:31.740]   It's broken.
[01:01:31.740 --> 01:01:34.220]   Yeah, that's all they have.
[01:01:34.220 --> 01:01:35.180]   Do they have the choice of it?
[01:01:35.180 --> 01:01:36.180]   64 gig.
[01:01:36.180 --> 01:01:39.540]   They have the choice of it doesn't work.
[01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:41.940]   They sometimes they'll buy stuff that doesn't work.
[01:01:41.940 --> 01:01:42.940]   Broken.
[01:01:42.940 --> 01:01:44.820]   Yes, see, they're not going to take it.
[01:01:44.820 --> 01:01:45.820]   Crunchy.
[01:01:45.820 --> 01:01:48.420]   They're not going to take it.
[01:01:48.420 --> 01:01:49.420]   Please take it.
[01:01:49.420 --> 01:01:50.420]   Please.
[01:01:50.420 --> 01:01:51.420]   Oh, $19.
[01:01:51.420 --> 01:01:52.420]   Ow.
[01:01:52.420 --> 01:01:53.420]   Ow.
[01:01:53.420 --> 01:01:57.100]   Hey, at least they pay me, right?
[01:01:57.100 --> 01:01:58.340]   Most of your stuff is working.
[01:01:58.340 --> 01:01:59.340]   It will get more money.
[01:01:59.340 --> 01:02:02.940]   And actually, they will buy non-working iPhones for a lot more money because they can reuse
[01:02:02.940 --> 01:02:03.940]   the parts.
[01:02:03.940 --> 01:02:04.940]   Ipods, tablets.
[01:02:04.940 --> 01:02:10.740]   Let's take a 3G iPad, because I think there's a lot of people want to get rid of their iPad,
[01:02:10.740 --> 01:02:12.620]   because they know a new iPad's in the market.
[01:02:12.620 --> 01:02:13.620]   Get an offer on that $32.
[01:02:13.620 --> 01:02:14.620]   Turn a box.
[01:02:14.620 --> 01:02:15.620]   Look at that.
[01:02:15.620 --> 01:02:19.780]   It's $200 gigabyte WiFi only for $200.
[01:02:19.780 --> 01:02:20.780]   I'm telling you, go there.
[01:02:20.780 --> 01:02:22.260]   It's just fun to see what your stuff is worth.
[01:02:22.260 --> 01:02:25.740]   Go through that drawer, the gadget drawer, the closet, the stuff under your bed.
[01:02:25.740 --> 01:02:27.340]   It's collecting dust.
[01:02:27.340 --> 01:02:28.340]   Turn it into cash.
[01:02:28.340 --> 01:02:31.860]   You can get a check, of course, but they'll pay pallet to you if you need it right away.
[01:02:31.860 --> 01:02:37.460]   And even better, if you're an Amazon buyer and I always buy stuff on Amazon, get an Amazon
[01:02:37.460 --> 01:02:39.860]   gift card because they'll bump that up 5%.
[01:02:39.860 --> 01:02:42.580]   Give you back the Amazon affiliate fee.
[01:02:42.580 --> 01:02:47.140]   Gazelle locks in the quote for 30 days, so this is not a commitment to sell just a...
[01:02:47.140 --> 01:02:49.220]   You're just finding out what it's worth.
[01:02:49.220 --> 01:02:54.060]   However, you might be surprised at the thousands of dollars under your bed right now.
[01:02:54.060 --> 01:02:59.180]   Gazelle has paid over $100 million to half a million customers over the last few years.
[01:02:59.180 --> 01:03:03.100]   Go there now, find out what your old gadgets are worth and maybe get some money for your
[01:03:03.100 --> 01:03:04.260]   new gadget.
[01:03:04.260 --> 01:03:08.300]   Gazelle, G-A-Z-E-W-L-E.com.
[01:03:08.300 --> 01:03:13.580]   All right, if I were gonna...
[01:03:13.580 --> 01:03:19.940]   Look, you know I have a watch fetish and I have bought many a watch, some of them somewhat
[01:03:19.940 --> 01:03:22.020]   expensive watches because I like watches.
[01:03:22.020 --> 01:03:23.740]   Hatterize and Rolex is all?
[01:03:23.740 --> 01:03:27.020]   Yeah, that kind of thing, although not that expensive.
[01:03:27.020 --> 01:03:30.900]   But that's jewelry.
[01:03:30.900 --> 01:03:35.580]   So if I could have jewelry with functionality, I might be even more interested.
[01:03:35.580 --> 01:03:37.940]   I'm willing to wear a watch.
[01:03:37.940 --> 01:03:40.740]   Here's the situation.
[01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:46.620]   You've really put your finger on it, that there are such a wide price range of watches.
[01:03:46.620 --> 01:03:51.140]   There's a lot of people that expect that will never want to pay more than 30 bucks for a
[01:03:51.140 --> 01:03:53.580]   watch and they never want to buy it outside of a drugstore.
[01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:59.780]   But there's so many people who will buy $100, $200, $300 for not even a particularly spectacular
[01:03:59.780 --> 01:04:01.260]   wristwatch.
[01:04:01.260 --> 01:04:04.940]   How many of those people could be accessed if you simply pitch this to them as, "It's
[01:04:04.940 --> 01:04:05.940]   $129.
[01:04:05.940 --> 01:04:07.580]   It's a really cool watch."
[01:04:07.580 --> 01:04:11.220]   It does other things, but for now focus on the fact that it has a really cool face, it
[01:04:11.220 --> 01:04:15.860]   has beautiful Apple design and maybe it's not going to be the watch that you will wear
[01:04:15.860 --> 01:04:19.740]   every single day, but it will be in your two or three watch rotation.
[01:04:19.740 --> 01:04:21.820]   Don't you think that Apple could sell it?
[01:04:21.820 --> 01:04:23.860]   Assuming they're not going to charge stupid prices for it.
[01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:27.180]   Don't you think they could sell it as it's just a really cool timepiece?
[01:04:27.180 --> 01:04:34.700]   And by the way, if you move, if you stroke two fingers against the bezel like this, you
[01:04:34.700 --> 01:04:36.740]   will open up a drawer that will make it do cool things.
[01:04:36.740 --> 01:04:38.780]   And before then, it will just be a really cool watch.
[01:04:38.780 --> 01:04:40.980]   Will they do that?
[01:04:40.980 --> 01:04:43.820]   That puts them in the jewelry business.
[01:04:43.820 --> 01:04:44.820]   It's our gadget business.
[01:04:44.820 --> 01:04:46.060]   It's not a gadget.
[01:04:46.060 --> 01:04:47.060]   It's jewelry.
[01:04:47.060 --> 01:04:48.060]   It doesn't have to.
[01:04:48.060 --> 01:04:49.060]   Jewelry.
[01:04:49.060 --> 01:04:50.060]   Well, how about just a cool watch?
[01:04:50.060 --> 01:04:51.060]   A cool watch is jewelry.
[01:04:51.060 --> 01:04:52.060]   Okay.
[01:04:52.060 --> 01:04:58.820]   So if I go upstairs and get my Millennium Falcon wristwatch, the one that I think I'd
[01:04:58.820 --> 01:05:02.700]   die cast Millennium Falcon, like a pocket watch, we have to pop open the top.
[01:05:02.700 --> 01:05:05.380]   Would you identify that as jewelry or as a cool watch?
[01:05:05.380 --> 01:05:08.460]   Well, that's something else, but I don't think they're going to sell Millennium Falcon
[01:05:08.460 --> 01:05:09.460]   watch.
[01:05:09.460 --> 01:05:10.460]   It's a cool watch.
[01:05:10.460 --> 01:05:14.300]   Millennium Falcon wristwatch is a cool watch.
[01:05:14.300 --> 01:05:15.900]   I think Andy is right about the price point.
[01:05:15.900 --> 01:05:17.500]   So I mean, you do have the drugstore watches.
[01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:20.340]   You do have the Rolex's and the Panerai's and Apple's probably not going to appeal to
[01:05:20.340 --> 01:05:24.300]   either of those audiences, but they could probably make a case the same way.
[01:05:24.300 --> 01:05:28.020]   You know, Steve Jobs made his case for the iPhone by looking at what was wrong with styluses
[01:05:28.020 --> 01:05:29.020]   and hardware keyboards.
[01:05:29.020 --> 01:05:32.380]   And he made his case for the iPad by pointing out there's sometimes something that needs
[01:05:32.380 --> 01:05:36.820]   more than a smartphone, but less than a tablet where they could say these, you know, this
[01:05:36.820 --> 01:05:38.180]   is an Apple watch.
[01:05:38.180 --> 01:05:42.980]   Looks, you know, Johnny I beautiful, but also, you know, is all your Siri cards or in widgets
[01:05:42.980 --> 01:05:43.980]   are there.
[01:05:43.980 --> 01:05:47.300]   All your notification center stuff is there will give you this functionality because
[01:05:47.300 --> 01:05:50.060]   with Apple, the form is supposed to dictate the functionality.
[01:05:50.060 --> 01:05:54.140]   And that could be intriguing enough that it gets sort of the Apple TV like hobby foothold.
[01:05:54.140 --> 01:05:57.140]   And all it really does is enhance the value of Apple's ecosystem.
[01:05:57.140 --> 01:06:01.620]   So when you buy an iPhone or iPad and you also want to have a watch, you can get all
[01:06:01.620 --> 01:06:04.620]   these extra things to go along with it for how much?
[01:06:04.620 --> 01:06:08.460]   I, you know, as with Apple, it'll probably start.
[01:06:08.460 --> 01:06:10.660]   It'll be like the eye, the original iPhone or the original iPad.
[01:06:10.660 --> 01:06:14.220]   It'll be a little bit too pricey and a little bit too big and a little bit not perfect.
[01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:18.660]   And then generation two and three will make it thinner and lighter and much more fantastic
[01:06:18.660 --> 01:06:22.140]   and we'll all make blog posts saying this is the eye watch that Apple should have shipped
[01:06:22.140 --> 01:06:23.140]   to start with.
[01:06:23.140 --> 01:06:27.820]   That's that's, but that's kind of a difficulty where if they do follow that program, if it's
[01:06:27.820 --> 01:06:30.900]   too expensive to start with, it will always be too expensive.
[01:06:30.900 --> 01:06:33.420]   They will always put more features into it and they'll make it thinner and they'll prove
[01:06:33.420 --> 01:06:34.420]   the battery life.
[01:06:34.420 --> 01:06:37.820]   But it will, if they, if it starts off with a $300 watch, it will never be anything other
[01:06:37.820 --> 01:06:39.260]   than a $300 watch.
[01:06:39.260 --> 01:06:44.820]   I think they really do have to not only get a below $200, they have to get $200 and you've
[01:06:44.820 --> 01:06:47.500]   got change left over for dinner in a movie after that.
[01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:48.500]   What was then the square now?
[01:06:48.500 --> 01:06:50.300]   It was $149 starting.
[01:06:50.300 --> 01:06:51.300]   Yeah.
[01:06:51.300 --> 01:06:54.260]   Hey, won't we want you can't make anything good for $149.
[01:06:54.260 --> 01:06:58.260]   I felt the wristwatch cost $38 Leo.
[01:06:58.260 --> 01:07:03.940]   You're not going to get me in that conversation.
[01:07:03.940 --> 01:07:07.340]   That's, I think I already got you.
[01:07:07.340 --> 01:07:09.820]   Yeah, I learned my lesson.
[01:07:09.820 --> 01:07:10.820]   I'm not a state.
[01:07:10.820 --> 01:07:14.300]   It's a lecture in the position of saying that a Millennium Falcon wristwatch isn't cool.
[01:07:14.300 --> 01:07:15.300]   Well, that's fine.
[01:07:15.300 --> 01:07:18.860]   Maybe I just won't, you know, maybe one that I bought for you is not going to maybe I'll
[01:07:18.860 --> 01:07:19.860]   just go along to that.
[01:07:19.860 --> 01:07:23.020]   I'm not saying Apple's not going to do it, but I don't, I find it difficult to think
[01:07:23.020 --> 01:07:24.380]   that of what they could do.
[01:07:24.380 --> 01:07:25.980]   You know, for instance, you say Google now cards.
[01:07:25.980 --> 01:07:26.980]   Yeah, that would be cool.
[01:07:26.980 --> 01:07:28.380]   Apple doesn't have anything like that.
[01:07:28.380 --> 01:07:33.620]   Well, they have notifications, which is so, which is really ambitious and really flexible
[01:07:33.620 --> 01:07:37.780]   that they could push a notification of that form to pretty much anything with a screen
[01:07:37.780 --> 01:07:38.780]   and a pulse.
[01:07:38.780 --> 01:07:41.940]   And so if they just used it as a target, it's just a cool watch and it's just a target
[01:07:41.940 --> 01:07:44.340]   for notifications, that could be cool enough.
[01:07:44.340 --> 01:07:48.620]   And they've also demonstrated with their own in house apps that third party apps can
[01:07:48.620 --> 01:07:53.260]   only push very boring notifications, but Apple and Apple internally can build ones that
[01:07:53.260 --> 01:07:56.220]   have functionality and have really nice design to them.
[01:07:56.220 --> 01:07:58.740]   So they don't have, they have to add a lot of functionality.
[01:07:58.740 --> 01:07:59.740]   They're notifications.
[01:07:59.740 --> 01:08:01.900]   Their notifications aren't that functional at this point.
[01:08:01.900 --> 01:08:06.180]   Well, look at the ones that Apple that Apple produces for their own apps.
[01:08:06.180 --> 01:08:08.900]   You know, they can actually, they can tell you the weather, they can tell you these talk
[01:08:08.900 --> 01:08:11.980]   times, they can, well, forgive me because I stopped using the iPhone.
[01:08:11.980 --> 01:08:17.020]   Will Apple Maps tell me that what the traffic's like on the way home ahead of time?
[01:08:17.020 --> 01:08:20.460]   Like say, this would be good time to leave because don't do predictive yet.
[01:08:20.460 --> 01:08:22.180]   They will, they will update you in real time.
[01:08:22.180 --> 01:08:24.540]   If you've got the whole point of Google now is predicted.
[01:08:24.540 --> 01:08:25.540]   Right.
[01:08:25.540 --> 01:08:28.100]   But we're not talking about Google now, we're talking about a mechanism for taking a piece
[01:08:28.100 --> 01:08:32.020]   of information and putting it on a small screen of arbitrary size.
[01:08:32.020 --> 01:08:36.140]   The notifications network system that they have for iOS is very muscular and it really
[01:08:36.140 --> 01:08:37.620]   can't handle that sort of stuff.
[01:08:37.620 --> 01:08:41.060]   If they wanted to go into that direction, all they would have to do is decide what they
[01:08:41.060 --> 01:08:42.740]   wanted to fill that little box with.
[01:08:42.740 --> 01:08:45.780]   They wouldn't have to build a brand new box for it.
[01:08:45.780 --> 01:08:49.380]   And by the way, it probably isn't just a thing that has a strap.
[01:08:49.380 --> 01:08:51.820]   It probably is the bracelet, right?
[01:08:51.820 --> 01:08:54.220]   If they want a lot of battery in it, it has to be.
[01:08:54.220 --> 01:08:58.300]   I don't know because how many different, how many different risks are you going to have
[01:08:58.300 --> 01:08:59.620]   to support with one size?
[01:08:59.620 --> 01:09:06.940]   If you look at this, I mean, this is the Nike, the Nike fuel band works and Fitbit has one
[01:09:06.940 --> 01:09:07.940]   too.
[01:09:07.940 --> 01:09:10.420]   And I wouldn't, but here's this was thicker.
[01:09:10.420 --> 01:09:11.780]   It wouldn't, it really wouldn't bother me.
[01:09:11.780 --> 01:09:18.820]   What if it were half an inch wide and very thin and a flexible screen chock full of
[01:09:18.820 --> 01:09:20.180]   battery so it lasts a long time?
[01:09:20.180 --> 01:09:24.900]   Also, Alex, you're ignoring something in that that your Nike band does not have a specific
[01:09:24.900 --> 01:09:28.060]   face that has to be facing the right way at all times.
[01:09:28.060 --> 01:09:29.060]   So we can't really revel in that.
[01:09:29.060 --> 01:09:30.060]   Well, it does.
[01:09:30.060 --> 01:09:31.060]   It has a display.
[01:09:31.060 --> 01:09:32.580]   Yeah, but you're not checking it there.
[01:09:32.580 --> 01:09:35.220]   You're not, yeah, but you're not checking it like several times a day.
[01:09:35.220 --> 01:09:36.220]   Are you?
[01:09:36.220 --> 01:09:37.220]   Yeah.
[01:09:37.220 --> 01:09:38.220]   I do mine.
[01:09:38.220 --> 01:09:43.740]   I, I, I, there's the worst part is I probably check my Nike band like 10, 15 times a day
[01:09:43.740 --> 01:09:45.180]   because I'm constantly managing.
[01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:50.100]   Hey, if you, once you start setting the goal at 5,000, you know, on, on your Nike fuel
[01:09:50.100 --> 01:09:52.100]   band, you do check it all the time.
[01:09:52.100 --> 01:09:55.660]   I am on record is saying there's no Apple TV.
[01:09:55.660 --> 01:09:58.740]   I'm going to go on record, even though everybody says there's an eye watch, including Renee
[01:09:58.740 --> 01:10:00.060]   Richie, who has very good sources.
[01:10:00.060 --> 01:10:02.060]   I don't think there's an eye watch.
[01:10:02.060 --> 01:10:04.100]   Do we get that on tape?
[01:10:04.100 --> 01:10:09.420]   I don't think there's either a T and I've said from the beginning, there's not a TV.
[01:10:09.420 --> 01:10:10.940]   And I don't think there's a watch.
[01:10:10.940 --> 01:10:13.620]   I think it's a dumb, both of them are dumb products.
[01:10:13.620 --> 01:10:14.900]   I think both of them exist.
[01:10:14.900 --> 01:10:19.340]   The question is, as Renee says, will they actually, and I, I do believe that they're
[01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:23.580]   making watches in the same quantity that Google now has copies of Google class enough that
[01:10:23.580 --> 01:10:28.660]   they could put many copies of these out there and see how well they work in the real world.
[01:10:28.660 --> 01:10:31.700]   But yeah, I mean, Apple is notorious for weed.
[01:10:31.700 --> 01:10:32.700]   It's not a real thing.
[01:10:32.700 --> 01:10:33.700]   It can be boxed.
[01:10:33.700 --> 01:10:36.980]   It could be shrink wrapped until they decide they want to ship it.
[01:10:36.980 --> 01:10:40.180]   What do we think of the different approaches that because I think that this is too very,
[01:10:40.180 --> 01:10:44.780]   very classic, a very classic contrast here is the way Google is doing glass and the way
[01:10:44.780 --> 01:10:49.260]   that Apple does what it does is that, you know, you know, Google really opens itself
[01:10:49.260 --> 01:10:53.300]   up to other people like Apple if they decided that glass was really working to do something
[01:10:53.300 --> 01:10:54.620]   like that.
[01:10:54.620 --> 01:10:59.380]   But at the same time, also, obviously Google is getting an enormous amount of feedback,
[01:10:59.380 --> 01:11:02.420]   you know, over it by by doing maybe even more important publicity.
[01:11:02.420 --> 01:11:03.420]   Oh my gosh.
[01:11:03.420 --> 01:11:06.620]   Yeah, just eight of them to my glass glass glass glass glass.
[01:11:06.620 --> 01:11:10.780]   That's absolutely exactly the way they would have to do a product like that, especially
[01:11:10.780 --> 01:11:13.220]   they're saying that we're not shipping this yet.
[01:11:13.220 --> 01:11:14.780]   We are we have this cool idea.
[01:11:14.780 --> 01:11:17.900]   We want to put it out there and see what people want to do with this.
[01:11:17.900 --> 01:11:22.380]   That way they can always roll back on their ambitions and they can always make their ambitions
[01:11:22.380 --> 01:11:25.140]   exceed what they originally had depending on what kind of feedback.
[01:11:25.140 --> 01:11:27.780]   Wow, but that would be a big shift in strategy.
[01:11:27.780 --> 01:11:30.820]   I think of that cannot think of Apple ever doing that.
[01:11:30.820 --> 01:11:31.820]   Right.
[01:11:31.820 --> 01:11:32.820]   That would be a huge shift in strategy.
[01:11:32.820 --> 01:11:33.820]   It's, it's, it's, it's not how it will be.
[01:11:33.820 --> 01:11:34.820]   It's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's not how it
[01:11:34.820 --> 01:11:35.820]   will be done.
[01:11:35.820 --> 01:11:36.820]   Microsoft does it all the time.
[01:11:36.820 --> 01:11:37.820]   Apple's never done that.
[01:11:37.820 --> 01:11:38.820]   They've said, here's what it is.
[01:11:38.820 --> 01:11:39.820]   You like it or not?
[01:11:39.820 --> 01:11:45.060]   Well, I mean, they've talked about the Apple TV being a hobby for a long time and it's,
[01:11:45.060 --> 01:11:47.580]   it's now become, I mean, that's only cause it didn't sell.
[01:11:47.580 --> 01:11:51.460]   They didn't say here, try this for a few months and we'll come back and fix it.
[01:11:51.460 --> 01:11:53.620]   They sold it hard and it didn't sell.
[01:11:53.620 --> 01:11:54.620]   So now it's a hobby.
[01:11:54.620 --> 01:11:55.620]   Yeah.
[01:11:55.620 --> 01:11:57.700]   For Tiger Woods golf was a hobby until he started making money.
[01:11:57.700 --> 01:11:58.700]   Yeah.
[01:11:58.700 --> 01:12:01.300]   When they made him a hockey puck, when they made him a hockey puck, I think that's when
[01:12:01.300 --> 01:12:03.660]   it really, you know, it changed pretty dramatically.
[01:12:03.660 --> 01:12:04.820]   I don't know that.
[01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:09.100]   I don't see a lot of rocus and boxes and everything else.
[01:12:09.100 --> 01:12:12.660]   When I, you know, when I go to, whether it's corporate, you know, I mean, literally like
[01:12:12.660 --> 01:12:14.700]   corporate boardrooms and people's houses.
[01:12:14.700 --> 01:12:17.940]   What I see are lots of little Apple TVs, you know, and the corporate rooms are just using
[01:12:17.940 --> 01:12:20.140]   it to sink their iPads for presentation.
[01:12:20.140 --> 01:12:24.500]   Yeah, they, Apple really turned it into a dongle for, yeah, it's iPad.
[01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:25.740]   For some of the things, yeah.
[01:12:25.740 --> 01:12:26.740]   Yeah.
[01:12:26.740 --> 01:12:27.740]   I mean, that's come on.
[01:12:27.740 --> 01:12:28.740]   Really, that's what it is.
[01:12:28.740 --> 01:12:29.740]   Otherwise you buy a Roku.
[01:12:29.740 --> 01:12:31.260]   And that's what an eye watch could be.
[01:12:31.260 --> 01:12:34.340]   It could be another dongle, a very similar to the Apple TV is just a way to make your
[01:12:34.340 --> 01:12:36.340]   iPhone and iPad experience better.
[01:12:36.340 --> 01:12:37.340]   Yeah.
[01:12:37.340 --> 01:12:38.340]   Doesn't make it better.
[01:12:38.340 --> 01:12:39.340]   That's my question.
[01:12:39.340 --> 01:12:40.340]   Why does it better?
[01:12:40.340 --> 01:12:42.620]   Because it's on my wrist than here in, because you don't have to check your phone.
[01:12:42.620 --> 01:12:44.620]   Your notifications are just there.
[01:12:44.620 --> 01:12:45.620]   That's all I was to do.
[01:12:45.620 --> 01:12:46.620]   iOS seven could be.
[01:12:46.620 --> 01:12:49.660]   They did a lot of interesting things with iOS six that we haven't seen yet.
[01:12:49.660 --> 01:12:52.740]   And iOS seven could have a better version of notification center.
[01:12:52.740 --> 01:12:54.660]   It could have a lot of engines in series.
[01:12:54.660 --> 01:12:58.220]   Anything that they announced for iOS seven is going to be interesting just in terms of
[01:12:58.220 --> 01:12:59.860]   where else they could use that technology.
[01:12:59.860 --> 01:13:01.700]   So that's one thing we'll be looking for on June 10th.
[01:13:01.700 --> 01:13:02.700]   You're absolutely right.
[01:13:02.700 --> 01:13:06.780]   They, it, that, I mean, because you said it, Andy, if they could put predictive technology,
[01:13:06.780 --> 01:13:10.060]   the Google now cards on there, you know, that would be great.
[01:13:10.060 --> 01:13:13.540]   You know, you got an appointment coming up as one thing, but saying the weather tomorrow,
[01:13:13.540 --> 01:13:15.900]   bringing umbrella, your traffic conditions are bad.
[01:13:15.900 --> 01:13:16.900]   You might want to go somewhere else.
[01:13:16.900 --> 01:13:18.420]   I see you're at the airport.
[01:13:18.420 --> 01:13:22.500]   Here is your barcode for your, your ticket.
[01:13:22.500 --> 01:13:23.500]   Those things would be valuable.
[01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:26.620]   And they have Google can do that though, because you're going through Gmail and Google
[01:13:26.620 --> 01:13:27.620]   has your mail.
[01:13:27.620 --> 01:13:31.700]   Well, I mean, Google has a huge advantage, but Apple's advantage is that the Google can
[01:13:31.700 --> 01:13:34.740]   put Google now in, but any manufacturer can just take it out or they could replace it
[01:13:34.740 --> 01:13:36.580]   with S voice or they could do anything they want.
[01:13:36.580 --> 01:13:37.580]   Yeah.
[01:13:37.580 --> 01:13:39.420]   Apple would deploy it across every iOS device.
[01:13:39.420 --> 01:13:43.500]   So it might not have as many features or we don't have as much deep integration or Apple
[01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:47.180]   might not choose to do those things, but Apple has access to your calendar and access to your
[01:13:47.180 --> 01:13:49.220]   location and access to the weather.
[01:13:49.220 --> 01:13:52.780]   And they could put together a pretty compelling thing that suddenly, I don't know how many,
[01:13:52.780 --> 01:13:54.860]   but 100 million users would have all at once.
[01:13:54.860 --> 01:13:55.860]   Right.
[01:13:55.860 --> 01:14:00.140]   And by the way, Google Glass has all of those and I'm not still not compelled to buy it.
[01:14:00.140 --> 01:14:03.620]   So it's got to be partly that's because you're wearing it here, which is kind of, that's
[01:14:03.620 --> 01:14:06.020]   so that's okay because you can't buy it.
[01:14:06.020 --> 01:14:07.020]   I did buy it.
[01:14:07.020 --> 01:14:09.020]   I'm making 100 bucks and I'm making Jason wearing.
[01:14:09.020 --> 01:14:10.020]   Sorry.
[01:14:10.020 --> 01:14:11.020]   The Royal you.
[01:14:11.020 --> 01:14:12.020]   Yes.
[01:14:12.020 --> 01:14:18.780]   This royal we did buy at 1500 bucks later.
[01:14:18.780 --> 01:14:19.780]   I don't know.
[01:14:19.780 --> 01:14:22.980]   I mean, you're so let me ask you this Renee.
[01:14:22.980 --> 01:14:26.340]   Are you dead certain it will be announced and I watch will be announced this year?
[01:14:26.340 --> 01:14:27.620]   No, I am.
[01:14:27.620 --> 01:14:29.580]   I'm all I have heard is that it has left the lab.
[01:14:29.580 --> 01:14:32.580]   There's a lot of things that are in the last really crazy things are allowed.
[01:14:32.580 --> 01:14:36.540]   I've heard the TV has not left the lab, but the watch has taken the next step.
[01:14:36.540 --> 01:14:41.700]   Yes, which is and there's a long step between that between the lab and being a product.
[01:14:41.700 --> 01:14:47.260]   Part of the reason I'm cranky is I want to believe I really would love to see Apple come
[01:14:47.260 --> 01:14:51.940]   out with a brand new product category that just I want to see the next iPhone.
[01:14:51.940 --> 01:14:52.940]   I want to see the next iPad.
[01:14:52.940 --> 01:14:54.220]   I want that new product.
[01:14:54.220 --> 01:14:55.620]   I want to believe big time.
[01:14:55.620 --> 01:14:57.380]   I'm having a hard time believing that's all I'm saying.
[01:14:57.380 --> 01:14:59.500]   How long it took from purple to get to the phone.
[01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:00.500]   I mean, that was years.
[01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:01.500]   I think two and a half years.
[01:15:01.500 --> 01:15:02.500]   Well, before the phone.
[01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:03.500]   Yeah.
[01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:04.500]   Yeah.
[01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:05.500]   It's all about the eye kitchen.
[01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:06.500]   The what?
[01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:11.900]   The eye kitchen refrigerators, stoves, ovens that all sync with your iPad.
[01:15:11.900 --> 01:15:18.980]   That is those are shows that many a company has cast their boat upon and the company that
[01:15:18.980 --> 01:15:19.980]   can do it is Apple.
[01:15:19.980 --> 01:15:24.460]   Well, I mean, I saw it sounds like I did the tour with the sorry, it's yes, I did the
[01:15:24.460 --> 01:15:28.580]   tour with Samsung and LG and they showed us all the Android powered fridges and phones
[01:15:28.580 --> 01:15:29.580]   and watch it.
[01:15:29.580 --> 01:15:34.300]   Sorry, the fridges and the little Roomba rip offs and the stoves that you could do and
[01:15:34.300 --> 01:15:37.620]   Apple doesn't have an appliance manufacturing wing the way those companies do and Apple
[01:15:37.620 --> 01:15:40.740]   doesn't typically license iOS the way that Android is licensed.
[01:15:40.740 --> 01:15:44.500]   So for Apple to make an appliance play, they'd have to if they stick with their old model
[01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:45.500]   have to get into.
[01:15:45.500 --> 01:15:51.780]   By the way, maybe maybe supporting this according to Fos patents, Apple has filed a complaint
[01:15:51.780 --> 01:15:57.100]   not only against the Galaxy S4, but apparently identified two patents infringed by Google
[01:15:57.100 --> 01:15:58.340]   now.
[01:15:58.340 --> 01:16:01.020]   And this is the first time Apple's really taken on Google directly.
[01:16:01.020 --> 01:16:03.860]   They've always been using proxies.
[01:16:03.860 --> 01:16:05.580]   So that's interesting.
[01:16:05.580 --> 01:16:10.460]   If Apple says, I know we have a patent on stuff Google now is using and these are like
[01:16:10.460 --> 01:16:16.020]   Siri, I think Siri patents probably, but that's intriguing.
[01:16:16.020 --> 01:16:17.020]   Yeah.
[01:16:17.020 --> 01:16:18.020]   Let's see.
[01:16:18.020 --> 01:16:20.780]   Let's see how far they get with that.
[01:16:20.780 --> 01:16:22.420]   Yeah, I'd be very interested.
[01:16:22.420 --> 01:16:26.900]   But also, I think that given how important not only and the good and how important Google
[01:16:26.900 --> 01:16:31.060]   now is that's a check that any company that's invested in that would be more than happy
[01:16:31.060 --> 01:16:32.060]   to write.
[01:16:32.060 --> 01:16:34.060]   They'll fight that to the very end.
[01:16:34.060 --> 01:16:35.060]   Oh, yeah.
[01:16:35.060 --> 01:16:38.940]   And then if there's a $1.2 billion judgment saying, great, goodbye.
[01:16:38.940 --> 01:16:39.940]   Yep.
[01:16:39.940 --> 01:16:43.820]   No, I think Google's invested in now and this is and one of the reasons Apple has attacked
[01:16:43.820 --> 01:16:48.340]   other companies besides Google is it's a little nerve wracking to say, okay, now we're going
[01:16:48.340 --> 01:16:49.340]   to take on Google.
[01:16:49.340 --> 01:16:52.300]   But that's clearly what the goal of all the Android.
[01:16:52.300 --> 01:16:57.140]   I mean, it's not the Samsung's a tiny company you can who will roll over for you by any means.
[01:16:57.140 --> 01:17:01.540]   Also, I mean, this the from the Google I/O keynote, one of the things that really hasn't been
[01:17:01.540 --> 01:17:06.820]   talked about is that every single they've they've talked about so many different products,
[01:17:06.820 --> 01:17:08.100]   no hardware whatsoever inside.
[01:17:08.100 --> 01:17:13.020]   They talked nothing about product about nothing but software products and every single one
[01:17:13.020 --> 01:17:16.940]   of them conveys information to the user in the form of cards.
[01:17:16.940 --> 01:17:22.300]   Even if it's a big huge like double retina screen, there's always the key information
[01:17:22.300 --> 01:17:25.540]   on that map about here is whether here's the restaurant, here's the ratings, here's
[01:17:25.540 --> 01:17:28.380]   other it's presented in the form of a card.
[01:17:28.380 --> 01:17:33.340]   It is designed to be really the molecule of information that Google can deploy to any
[01:17:33.340 --> 01:17:38.260]   device of any kind with any limitations that this device might have.
[01:17:38.260 --> 01:17:43.340]   So I mean, it's it's going to be a signature of Google's design aesthetic.
[01:17:43.340 --> 01:17:46.380]   And so really this is this is the checkbook is open.
[01:17:46.380 --> 01:17:51.140]   They're just using the course to negotiate the price for assuming assuming that courts
[01:17:51.140 --> 01:17:55.260]   agree that that some of their technology does infringe fine.
[01:17:55.260 --> 01:17:57.260]   We'll write the check and we'll move forward.
[01:17:57.260 --> 01:17:58.900]   I'm just waiting for the Google now phone.
[01:17:58.900 --> 01:17:59.900]   Forget the Facebook phone.
[01:17:59.900 --> 01:18:01.740]   The Google now phone is really interesting.
[01:18:01.740 --> 01:18:03.580]   It's kind of called Android.
[01:18:03.580 --> 01:18:08.460]   Oh, I know what you're saying is in fact, I said that to the Google plus folks, you know,
[01:18:08.460 --> 01:18:12.660]   you need to do a I don't until Bradley Harwoods you need to do with Google plus what Facebook
[01:18:12.660 --> 01:18:16.740]   did with Facebook home and I would I would love that I would love plus and now just to
[01:18:16.740 --> 01:18:19.860]   be the home screen experience with the lock screen experience and make it make let Motorola
[01:18:19.860 --> 01:18:22.780]   make the hardware and just let it let Google take Android back.
[01:18:22.780 --> 01:18:26.100]   I think that's I would be he let me put it this way.
[01:18:26.100 --> 01:18:28.100]   He went, Hmm.
[01:18:28.100 --> 01:18:36.420]   I think he gave me a pretty good non confirmation confirmation that Google now in the same style
[01:18:36.420 --> 01:18:39.620]   that Facebook home Google plus and now would be on the phone.
[01:18:39.620 --> 01:18:45.540]   I think that's absolutely in the future and not too far off either.
[01:18:45.540 --> 01:18:47.500]   John Stewart.
[01:18:47.500 --> 01:18:51.460]   This is the portion of the show where we get us pulled from YouTube.
[01:18:51.460 --> 01:18:54.860]   Like to do that on every episode.
[01:18:54.860 --> 01:18:59.660]   Would it help if like the three of us hum a public domain song while this video was out
[01:18:59.660 --> 01:19:04.420]   so that listeners could still hear the audio but to a scanner would seem as though we're
[01:19:04.420 --> 01:19:05.420]   doing battle.
[01:19:05.420 --> 01:19:08.540]   We have tried every stupid I don't even want to do tricks anymore, right?
[01:19:08.540 --> 01:19:15.580]   I want to I now want to I want to just say in your face, YouTube, take us down now.
[01:19:15.580 --> 01:19:17.260]   And then of course they do.
[01:19:17.260 --> 01:19:18.900]   So maybe that's not the best at it.
[01:19:18.900 --> 01:19:19.900]   But we've tried.
[01:19:19.900 --> 01:19:20.900]   What have we done chat?
[01:19:20.900 --> 01:19:22.060]   We've like we've angled it.
[01:19:22.060 --> 01:19:23.540]   We've small screened it.
[01:19:23.540 --> 01:19:24.540]   We've done all sorts of stuff.
[01:19:24.540 --> 01:19:25.540]   What's the sound?
[01:19:25.540 --> 01:19:26.540]   Yes, the sound is the sound.
[01:19:26.540 --> 01:19:27.540]   The content idea is sound.
[01:19:27.540 --> 01:19:29.700]   Alright, so it's so chat.
[01:19:29.700 --> 01:19:32.660]   Can you play the do you have the yeah, John Stewart.
[01:19:32.660 --> 01:19:34.700]   I don't I can't I don't have it front of me.
[01:19:34.700 --> 01:19:37.700]   You have you have the John Stewart bit.
[01:19:37.700 --> 01:19:38.700]   Cool face.
[01:19:38.700 --> 01:19:40.460]   Okay, everybody hum the battle him or the public.
[01:19:40.460 --> 01:19:41.460]   Mona.
[01:19:41.460 --> 01:19:42.460]   Some accountability.
[01:19:42.460 --> 01:19:43.460]   For out maps.
[01:19:43.460 --> 01:19:44.460]   Come on.
[01:19:44.460 --> 01:19:45.460]   80 some crazy.
[01:19:45.460 --> 01:19:46.460]   This is not working.
[01:19:46.460 --> 01:19:54.460]   No, I think it's just annoying to the viewer.
[01:19:54.460 --> 01:19:57.980]   I think it's a little Hudson River.
[01:19:57.980 --> 01:20:07.180]   Actually, Apple CEO Tim Cook was called in to face the wrath of senators wondering how
[01:20:07.180 --> 01:20:12.460]   Apple had avoided paying taxes on 44 billion dollars in income in the last four years.
[01:20:12.460 --> 01:20:16.580]   In part by stashing over a hundred billion dollars in nearly tax free offshore subsidiaries.
[01:20:16.580 --> 01:20:18.660]   Go get them new boys.
[01:20:18.660 --> 01:20:21.060]   I'm very proud of Apple.
[01:20:21.060 --> 01:20:23.060]   We love the iPhone and the iPad.
[01:20:23.060 --> 01:20:24.660]   I got one right here.
[01:20:24.660 --> 01:20:28.380]   You've managed to change the world, which is an incredible legacy.
[01:20:28.380 --> 01:20:32.460]   I've rasmed my husband until he converted to a MacBook.
[01:20:32.460 --> 01:20:33.460]   Your products are great.
[01:20:33.460 --> 01:20:35.300]   My granddaughter even knows how to use it.
[01:20:35.300 --> 01:20:37.740]   I love Apple.
[01:20:37.740 --> 01:20:40.500]   I love Apple.
[01:20:40.500 --> 01:20:43.340]   I.
[01:20:43.340 --> 01:20:44.820]   I want to I f**k you.
[01:20:44.820 --> 01:20:45.820]   I want to.
[01:20:45.820 --> 01:20:47.780]   Who are those people?
[01:20:47.780 --> 01:20:50.140]   What the hell was that?
[01:20:50.140 --> 01:20:51.180]   What is the opposite?
[01:20:51.180 --> 01:20:52.580]   What the hell was that?
[01:20:52.580 --> 01:20:55.780]   What is the opposite of a genius bar?
[01:20:55.780 --> 01:21:01.740]   Apparently, there is nothing Apple can do to get as mad at them.
[01:21:01.740 --> 01:21:06.500]   Dodging taxes, they got suicide prevention nets outside their health factories.
[01:21:06.500 --> 01:21:11.620]   We could find out they're using kitten hearts, the power iPhones.
[01:21:11.620 --> 01:21:17.180]   And we'd be like, well, if it doubles battery life, I'll take two.
[01:21:17.180 --> 01:21:18.700]   In fact, the hearing was less.
[01:21:18.700 --> 01:21:23.180]   We're angry at you for breaking curfew and more like, what time do you think you should
[01:21:23.180 --> 01:21:24.180]   get home?
[01:21:24.180 --> 01:21:31.180]   If you were in our position, how important do you think it is that we change the tax?
[01:21:31.180 --> 01:21:33.420]   I'm not a big fan of the Daily Show anymore.
[01:21:33.420 --> 01:21:36.300]   Another country in one of these emerging markets from...
[01:21:36.300 --> 01:21:37.300]   Why not?
[01:21:37.300 --> 01:21:38.300]   You don't like kitty cats?
[01:21:38.300 --> 01:21:44.500]   No, because this is Senate testimony, which goes on forever and forever and forever.
[01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:45.980]   And you just chop it up.
[01:21:45.980 --> 01:21:50.860]   Well, and also it's like, okay, so you found points during this proceeding where they
[01:21:50.860 --> 01:21:54.660]   said, we love Apple, hey, I've got my phone, but we can't stand how you're doing your
[01:21:54.660 --> 01:21:55.660]   thing.
[01:21:55.660 --> 01:22:01.700]   It's not so much slanted as it's a comedy show and they're trying to do comedy.
[01:22:01.700 --> 01:22:03.260]   But it's like, okay, fine, whatever.
[01:22:03.260 --> 01:22:04.460]   It makes me, I haven't seen it.
[01:22:04.460 --> 01:22:10.700]   It makes me want to seek out the online and find the actual testimony to see what the
[01:22:10.700 --> 01:22:17.900]   senators actually said.
[01:22:17.900 --> 01:22:22.540]   Ted conference talk, the points that Ted speakers may say.
[01:22:22.540 --> 01:22:27.700]   Interesting if true, which is how I regard like Daily Show.
[01:22:27.700 --> 01:22:29.820]   Okay, interesting if that actually happened.
[01:22:29.820 --> 01:22:30.820]   He did say it.
[01:22:30.820 --> 01:22:37.580]   And you have to give him some credit for saying, well, who made these arcane tax, Apple's
[01:22:37.580 --> 01:22:38.580]   not breaking the law.
[01:22:38.580 --> 01:22:40.180]   Who made these arcane tax laws?
[01:22:40.180 --> 01:22:41.940]   Congress, why did they make them?
[01:22:41.940 --> 01:22:47.540]   Well, it wasn't you and me that encouraged Congress to make these laws that let offshore
[01:22:47.540 --> 01:22:49.980]   corporations go without paying taxes.
[01:22:49.980 --> 01:22:53.180]   Exploration tax credits stay in place and the big agra makes sure that equipment depreciation
[01:22:53.180 --> 01:22:54.580]   credits stay in there.
[01:22:54.580 --> 01:22:57.620]   Because that's the rub of this entire exercise.
[01:22:57.620 --> 01:23:01.460]   Corporations are the only reason the tax code is so complicated in the first place.
[01:23:01.460 --> 01:23:04.980]   Those offshore loopholes didn't get carved out by poor people.
[01:23:04.980 --> 01:23:06.580]   Yeah, that's the real point.
[01:23:06.580 --> 01:23:08.620]   And I think that that's a legitimate point.
[01:23:08.620 --> 01:23:11.220]   We got the best Congress money can buy to quote, will not.
[01:23:11.220 --> 01:23:14.540]   Well, I mean, I think that also the issue is that the it's very difficult.
[01:23:14.540 --> 01:23:15.540]   It's not just tax code.
[01:23:15.540 --> 01:23:17.540]   I mean, how do you make that actually work?
[01:23:17.540 --> 01:23:22.180]   They're taking oftentimes simple loopholes that are actually there for a reason.
[01:23:22.180 --> 01:23:23.180]   And then they.
[01:23:23.180 --> 01:23:27.380]   Yeah, I think they're there for a reason is right.
[01:23:27.380 --> 01:23:30.660]   There's some companies can offshore their income and not pay taxes on.
[01:23:30.660 --> 01:23:34.060]   I mean, the reason but the way Apple's doing it is mostly because they're manufacturing
[01:23:34.060 --> 01:23:35.060]   everything over shore.
[01:23:35.060 --> 01:23:36.060]   So what, you know, offshore.
[01:23:36.060 --> 01:23:38.660]   But what's happening is they're paying their offshore.
[01:23:38.660 --> 01:23:43.060]   So it's a literary for the hardware that's coming back in.
[01:23:43.060 --> 01:23:47.580]   And so, you know, so they're basically taking the money that they made out outside of the
[01:23:47.580 --> 01:23:50.380]   country and keeping it there.
[01:23:50.380 --> 01:23:51.380]   Or the subsidiary.
[01:23:51.380 --> 01:23:52.380]   I don't think that's the case.
[01:23:52.380 --> 01:23:54.460]   They're not making them in Ireland.
[01:23:54.460 --> 01:23:55.460]   They're making.
[01:23:55.460 --> 01:24:01.020]   They have a $30 billion entity in Ireland that has zero employees, but made $30 billion.
[01:24:01.020 --> 01:24:02.940]   And that's why it pays no taxes anywhere.
[01:24:02.940 --> 01:24:05.260]   Well, no, but that's not about manufacture.
[01:24:05.260 --> 01:24:08.460]   That's about using a tax loophole offshore your private company.
[01:24:08.460 --> 01:24:09.460]   I know of use.
[01:24:09.460 --> 01:24:10.460]   They all do it.
[01:24:10.460 --> 01:24:11.460]   Yeah.
[01:24:11.460 --> 01:24:15.560]   And but it doesn't, but it gets them off the hook to say it's legal and Congress made
[01:24:15.560 --> 01:24:16.560]   these laws.
[01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:19.540]   But I think Stuart makes the more salient point, which is why these laws were made.
[01:24:19.540 --> 01:24:23.660]   And they were not made Alex because they serve some purpose.
[01:24:23.660 --> 01:24:27.260]   They were made so that corporations could use them to not pay taxes.
[01:24:27.260 --> 01:24:28.260]   Yeah.
[01:24:28.260 --> 01:24:29.260]   Well, I mean, well, definitely.
[01:24:29.260 --> 01:24:33.940]   I think that a lot of the, but a lot of these tax, these tax loopholes are built with,
[01:24:33.940 --> 01:24:37.540]   it's something that remotely looks like sometimes reasonable level.
[01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:41.740]   I mean, sometimes I don't think we give, we give people tax with enough math.
[01:24:41.740 --> 01:24:43.260]   You can get around an awful lot of taxes.
[01:24:43.260 --> 01:24:47.540]   I mean, so the thing is, is that it's, you know, there, we, we give people tax tax credits
[01:24:47.540 --> 01:24:50.140]   or tax breaks for their houses, you know, because we want people to buy.
[01:24:50.140 --> 01:24:51.140]   Right.
[01:24:51.140 --> 01:24:53.620]   And that's one that benefits you and me, but I don't think there's any case where either
[01:24:53.620 --> 01:24:57.340]   you or my company could put money into Ireland and not pay any taxes anywhere.
[01:24:57.340 --> 01:25:00.260]   It's probably also a differentiation between money that Apple earned outside the US and
[01:25:00.260 --> 01:25:02.100]   money that Apple sheltered outside the US.
[01:25:02.100 --> 01:25:03.100]   Absolutely.
[01:25:03.100 --> 01:25:08.300]   And the tax community, though, I do have to say that I find it amusing that people who,
[01:25:08.300 --> 01:25:12.260]   when people are using BitTorrent to download their music and everyone, and they say, well,
[01:25:12.260 --> 01:25:15.180]   they should just change the business model because it's broken.
[01:25:15.180 --> 01:25:20.460]   And then they complain about offshore taxes is a little, well, okay.
[01:25:20.460 --> 01:25:24.660]   So you're saying that nobody can complain unless, you know, he, he who is without seeing
[01:25:24.660 --> 01:25:28.100]   shell cast the first stone that people in the tech industry who talk, who've been talking
[01:25:28.100 --> 01:25:31.420]   about BitTorrent for a long time and are, and are just, you know, like this, the music
[01:25:31.420 --> 01:25:35.460]   industry is stupid and they should just figure it out.
[01:25:35.460 --> 01:25:38.900]   And then they, and then they are abhorred by what Apple has done legally.
[01:25:38.900 --> 01:25:42.540]   I, I'm not saying I don't have a problem with either one.
[01:25:42.540 --> 01:25:45.340]   So, so the thing is, I don't bro with Apple did I don't bro, you know, but I'm just saying
[01:25:45.340 --> 01:25:48.440]   that when people say that they're very upset about it, I just find it to be a little bit
[01:25:48.440 --> 01:25:52.900]   of a contradiction because, you know, you know, I think that the one of the big reasons
[01:25:52.900 --> 01:25:57.500]   that all of this is occurring is because United States corporate tax is one of the highest
[01:25:57.500 --> 01:25:58.600]   in the world.
[01:25:58.600 --> 01:26:01.260]   And that is, that is a, a lot of these companies.
[01:26:01.260 --> 01:26:02.260]   I would bring it back.
[01:26:02.260 --> 01:26:03.260]   Nobody pays it.
[01:26:03.260 --> 01:26:08.620]   Maybe the highest in the world, but that's kind of for show because nobody pays it except
[01:26:08.620 --> 01:26:09.620]   you and me.
[01:26:09.620 --> 01:26:12.580]   But, but the issue is, is that the reason that they don't, they don't even try to pay
[01:26:12.580 --> 01:26:14.420]   it is because it's so high.
[01:26:14.420 --> 01:26:17.860]   You know, and so the thing is, is that is that it's not even a, I mean, you know, the,
[01:26:17.860 --> 01:26:20.260]   if it was lower, there's a lot of inconvenience.
[01:26:20.260 --> 01:26:23.980]   Apple is borrowing money here so that they can, so they can keep their money offshore.
[01:26:23.980 --> 01:26:27.700]   Now, there's some place where that math starts to make sense for them to just bring it all
[01:26:27.700 --> 01:26:28.700]   back.
[01:26:28.700 --> 01:26:29.700]   Right.
[01:26:29.700 --> 01:26:32.500]   And what I'm thinking is, is that, is that, you know, I, I get that it makes good politics.
[01:26:32.500 --> 01:26:34.980]   No, another thing in the politics that they make 35%.
[01:26:34.980 --> 01:26:39.060]   We're pushing it to the, to the, to the corporate taxes and what we're not getting is any money
[01:26:39.060 --> 01:26:40.420]   out of that because we're.
[01:26:40.420 --> 01:26:41.420]   Yeah.
[01:26:41.420 --> 01:26:44.740]   And so it's very convenient for Apple to say you see if they just lower the tax rates,
[01:26:44.740 --> 01:26:45.740]   everything would be fine.
[01:26:45.740 --> 01:26:51.220]   Meanwhile, lobbying hard to make sure that those tax rates are mean nothing because they've
[01:26:51.220 --> 01:26:53.460]   got loopholes that have, last and avoid paying tax entirely.
[01:26:53.460 --> 01:26:56.460]   Not big enough because some of the Congress people are telling them they're not putting
[01:26:56.460 --> 01:26:58.020]   enough money into Washington to avoid these.
[01:26:58.020 --> 01:27:00.020]   Yeah, but don't you think that's for show?
[01:27:00.020 --> 01:27:02.940]   Is Apple not lobbying hard for show?
[01:27:02.940 --> 01:27:06.420]   No, no, don't you think that that, that whole congressional hearing is pure show?
[01:27:06.420 --> 01:27:07.420]   Yes.
[01:27:07.420 --> 01:27:10.540]   So, yeah, it has nothing to do with changing the law and the law will not change because
[01:27:10.540 --> 01:27:14.820]   Apple and other corporations and I, you know, I bet you Apple did not do the lobbying for
[01:27:14.820 --> 01:27:15.820]   these tax laws.
[01:27:15.820 --> 01:27:19.940]   I bet you it was other corporations like General Electric that lobbied for these tax laws.
[01:27:19.940 --> 01:27:23.420]   But to Alex's point, when you get to 99 cents songs, people stop stealing and maybe if you
[01:27:23.420 --> 01:27:26.820]   get to a tax rate that Apple, whoa, sorry, Alex.
[01:27:26.820 --> 01:27:28.220]   No, no, absolutely go ahead.
[01:27:28.220 --> 01:27:29.220]   Keep on going.
[01:27:29.220 --> 01:27:32.540]   No, I was going to say when you at 35% might have a lot of companies at bulk, but if it's
[01:27:32.540 --> 01:27:35.140]   at a different rate, you might have a lot of companies who just think it's easy to pay.
[01:27:35.140 --> 01:27:37.940]   I think 0% is always favorable even over five.
[01:27:37.940 --> 01:27:43.180]   But the thing is, I don't know a lot of people who steal music anymore because we have Spotify.
[01:27:43.180 --> 01:27:44.620]   We have, you know, iTunes.
[01:27:44.620 --> 01:27:47.540]   We have all these things that make it cheap and easy for us to get that, you know, get
[01:27:47.540 --> 01:27:52.420]   that handle that process, you know, and are the music, is the music industry making as
[01:27:52.420 --> 01:27:53.620]   much money per unit?
[01:27:53.620 --> 01:27:54.620]   No.
[01:27:54.620 --> 01:28:01.020]   Are we really stealing that the way many of us did in the distant past?
[01:28:01.020 --> 01:28:02.300]   You know, that has changed a lot.
[01:28:02.300 --> 01:28:06.100]   And I think that that is the issue is that, you know, they're not going to be able to
[01:28:06.100 --> 01:28:07.100]   solve this.
[01:28:07.100 --> 01:28:09.980]   And part of why they're not going to be able to solve it is because states are competing
[01:28:09.980 --> 01:28:12.900]   against states and countries are competing against countries for these corporations.
[01:28:12.900 --> 01:28:17.980]   These are multinational, you know, international companies that can play all these countries
[01:28:17.980 --> 01:28:18.980]   off of each other.
[01:28:18.980 --> 01:28:23.060]   And they're not going to be able to sort that out because the individual countries and the
[01:28:23.060 --> 01:28:27.380]   individual states have a vested interest, the smaller ones have a vested interest in
[01:28:27.380 --> 01:28:31.260]   making this available to them, you know, you know, so that these countries are in
[01:28:31.260 --> 01:28:32.260]   coercion.
[01:28:32.260 --> 01:28:36.020]   Ireland is saying, why are we being blamed for this?
[01:28:36.020 --> 01:28:37.020]   It's not a.
[01:28:37.020 --> 01:28:38.020]   Ireland.
[01:28:38.020 --> 01:28:39.020]   Ireland.
[01:28:39.020 --> 01:28:40.020]   Come on.
[01:28:40.020 --> 01:28:41.020]   Ireland is a structure.
[01:28:41.020 --> 01:28:43.180]   They, Ireland built the infrastructure.
[01:28:43.180 --> 01:28:44.420]   Of course they did.
[01:28:44.420 --> 01:28:47.020]   That was the Irish miracle, which collapsed.
[01:28:47.020 --> 01:28:50.140]   But what we do, but what we do in the United States, for instance, you know, we're in the
[01:28:50.140 --> 01:28:53.020]   film industry, you know, and in California, you don't get any subsidies.
[01:28:53.020 --> 01:28:59.940]   But in, in, you get 25% in tax credits, 40% tax credits in other states, whether it's
[01:28:59.940 --> 01:29:03.900]   whether it's actually we get, we get a reduced sales tax in the Bay Area if you're in the
[01:29:03.900 --> 01:29:05.380]   film or video industry.
[01:29:05.380 --> 01:29:06.380]   That's nothing.
[01:29:06.380 --> 01:29:07.380]   I know.
[01:29:07.380 --> 01:29:08.380]   But believe me, I take advantage of it.
[01:29:08.380 --> 01:29:14.540]   We always say we're in the yeah, but we're talking about we're talking about 25% tax credits
[01:29:14.540 --> 01:29:17.340]   on your production or hundreds of millions of dollars, not just the equipment because
[01:29:17.340 --> 01:29:20.740]   they want the film industry to take another million.
[01:29:20.740 --> 01:29:25.620]   So the thing is, is that all the, but this is a very similar, this is a microcosm of the
[01:29:25.620 --> 01:29:30.060]   exact same thing where states have decided it's in their best interest to pull work to
[01:29:30.060 --> 01:29:34.180]   their state by producing tax incentives to do that.
[01:29:34.180 --> 01:29:35.180]   Ireland did that.
[01:29:35.180 --> 01:29:36.180]   Exactly.
[01:29:36.180 --> 01:29:37.980]   And other countries do that because it brings a lot of money.
[01:29:37.980 --> 01:29:38.980]   It hurt them in the long run.
[01:29:38.980 --> 01:29:39.980]   It hurt them badly.
[01:29:39.980 --> 01:29:44.020]   In fact, the country really suffered economically in the last few years because of this very
[01:29:44.020 --> 01:29:45.020]   low corporate tax rate.
[01:29:45.020 --> 01:29:47.060]   But that's another matter entirely.
[01:29:47.060 --> 01:29:51.260]   Actually, somebody from Ireland says you're wrong.
[01:29:51.260 --> 01:29:53.540]   The Irish miracle collapsed because of property taxes.
[01:29:53.540 --> 01:29:54.540]   All right.
[01:29:54.540 --> 01:29:55.540]   Well, I don't know.
[01:29:55.540 --> 01:29:56.540]   I'm not an expert.
[01:29:56.540 --> 01:30:00.820]   Let's watch the Windows 8 ad that takes iPad Siri in vain.
[01:30:00.820 --> 01:30:03.940]   This is another YouTube killer here.
[01:30:03.940 --> 01:30:10.260]   Sorry, I don't update like that.
[01:30:10.260 --> 01:30:12.140]   By the way, I'm sorry.
[01:30:12.140 --> 01:30:15.660]   I can only do one thing at a time.
[01:30:15.660 --> 01:30:18.060]   I guess PowerPoint isn't one of those things.
[01:30:18.060 --> 01:30:25.660]   You should be just play chopsticks.
[01:30:25.660 --> 01:30:27.780]   So I think, oh, and this is the selling point right here.
[01:30:27.780 --> 01:30:32.980]   iPad 699 Windows RT or Windows 8 Pro 499.
[01:30:32.980 --> 01:30:35.500]   There's only one device, the Vivo, the Asus Vivo.
[01:30:35.500 --> 01:30:36.860]   That's that cheap.
[01:30:36.860 --> 01:30:41.660]   But our Windows guys, Paul Therott and Mary Jo Foley, thought that that was a brilliant
[01:30:41.660 --> 01:30:45.100]   ad that worked very effectively to make people want to buy Windows.
[01:30:45.100 --> 01:30:46.100]   You agree?
[01:30:46.100 --> 01:30:49.700]   I don't know if it made people want to buy Windows, but it's exactly sort of ad that
[01:30:49.700 --> 01:30:51.900]   Microsoft has to put forth.
[01:30:51.900 --> 01:30:56.300]   They have to produce the ad of the underdog that's having trouble convincing people to
[01:30:56.300 --> 01:30:59.060]   buy an RT tablet instead of an iPad.
[01:30:59.060 --> 01:31:01.820]   And if you want to do that, you say, well, here are things you absolutely positively
[01:31:01.820 --> 01:31:03.100]   cannot do with an iPad.
[01:31:03.100 --> 01:31:07.940]   You can do with our product that costs just as much money and by our view does more.
[01:31:07.940 --> 01:31:10.180]   So from that point of view, I thought it was a brilliant ad.
[01:31:10.180 --> 01:31:13.100]   You're not going to fight an iPad on iPad grounds.
[01:31:13.100 --> 01:31:14.940]   You're going to fight it on Windows RT grounds.
[01:31:14.940 --> 01:31:17.940]   And you've actually got a couple clubs in your bag for that.
[01:31:17.940 --> 01:31:19.020]   It's a droid does commercial.
[01:31:19.020 --> 01:31:22.060]   It's very similar to what Motorola was running against the iPhone earlier.
[01:31:22.060 --> 01:31:26.380]   But the tablet market is interesting because by and large, everyone has tried to compete
[01:31:26.380 --> 01:31:29.540]   with the iPad by offering a more computer-like experience.
[01:31:29.540 --> 01:31:30.780]   And every one of them is fizzled.
[01:31:30.780 --> 01:31:34.740]   And it might just be that the iPad struck the right balance of just enough computing
[01:31:34.740 --> 01:31:37.180]   to appeal to a very, very large audience.
[01:31:37.180 --> 01:31:42.020]   And those people are intimidated off put or not desirous of a more computer or more
[01:31:42.020 --> 01:31:44.020]   desktop-like tablet.
[01:31:44.020 --> 01:31:45.100]   And that's why they're not doing well.
[01:31:45.100 --> 01:31:49.180]   And no amount of I'm a Mac, I'm a PC advertising will change that.
[01:31:49.180 --> 01:31:54.900]   They will have to make a more user-friendly, simpler, more wide encompassing product.
[01:31:54.900 --> 01:31:55.900]   Not compromised.
[01:31:55.900 --> 01:31:56.900]   Yeah.
[01:31:56.900 --> 01:32:02.420]   I mean, because if you buy an iPad, it's not because you don't have being able to do PowerPoint
[01:32:02.420 --> 01:32:07.060]   and more than one thing at once is probably not on your list of checkboxes.
[01:32:07.060 --> 01:32:09.660]   Your mother has never not once asked for either of those features.
[01:32:09.660 --> 01:32:13.300]   Again, I do PowerPoint and have two things going at once, right?
[01:32:13.300 --> 01:32:15.500]   Now the price is pretty compelling.
[01:32:15.500 --> 01:32:22.380]   Of course, they use a 64-gig iPad for $699 to compare against a 64-gig Windows 8 tablet.
[01:32:22.380 --> 01:32:26.460]   And they've got a space you have left on iOS after the operating system is significantly
[01:32:26.460 --> 01:32:27.460]   more than here.
[01:32:27.460 --> 01:32:28.460]   Right.
[01:32:28.460 --> 01:32:32.660]   I'd like to see Microsoft do a similar ad, but only compare.
[01:32:32.660 --> 01:32:37.700]   Here is a convertible tablet that runs actual Windows 8.
[01:32:37.700 --> 01:32:43.860]   And so you can get this tablet from Apple that runs a sort of subset of what your desktop
[01:32:43.860 --> 01:32:46.420]   apps would do and recontextualize it.
[01:32:46.420 --> 01:32:49.420]   It works with a keyboard, even though it doesn't really work very well with the keyboard.
[01:32:49.420 --> 01:32:52.300]   No mouse, no controls like that.
[01:32:52.300 --> 01:32:55.260]   Or for the exact same amount of money, you can have the machine that runs the exact same
[01:32:55.260 --> 01:32:58.700]   operating system you have inside your office and inside your home PC.
[01:32:58.700 --> 01:33:00.260]   And it also will be nice and detachable.
[01:33:00.260 --> 01:33:01.940]   You can read comic books and watch movies.
[01:33:01.940 --> 01:33:03.700]   And you can also play chopsticks on it.
[01:33:03.700 --> 01:33:05.980]   Actually, that's a better selling point, isn't it?
[01:33:05.980 --> 01:33:06.980]   Yeah.
[01:33:06.980 --> 01:33:09.660]   But not having Windows might be the biggest feature of the tablet market right now.
[01:33:09.660 --> 01:33:13.700]   And there's no Windows 8 commercial can address that because it runs Windows and people might
[01:33:13.700 --> 01:33:14.700]   be running.
[01:33:14.700 --> 01:33:17.140]   Well, that is, by the way, that tablet is not an RT tablet.
[01:33:17.140 --> 01:33:19.700]   That's a Windows 8 Pro tablet for $450.
[01:33:19.700 --> 01:33:20.700]   Really?
[01:33:20.700 --> 01:33:21.700]   Yeah.
[01:33:21.700 --> 01:33:23.700]   No, it's not an RT tablet.
[01:33:23.700 --> 01:33:27.940]   I think my problem is that I still have a hard...
[01:33:27.940 --> 01:33:30.700]   When I look at the Windows tablet, I have a hard time seeing my kids or my parents using
[01:33:30.700 --> 01:33:31.700]   it.
[01:33:31.700 --> 01:33:32.700]   And I think that...
[01:33:32.700 --> 01:33:34.260]   I think a lot of the...
[01:33:34.260 --> 01:33:37.580]   They're definitely going to get some of the converted, but I don't know how big that
[01:33:37.580 --> 01:33:38.580]   converted market is.
[01:33:38.580 --> 01:33:42.220]   A lot of them have already jumped on Android, have already jumped on iOS.
[01:33:42.220 --> 01:33:44.820]   And they're invested in those platforms.
[01:33:44.820 --> 01:33:48.340]   And so the early adopters that I think are technologically driven that would have picked
[01:33:48.340 --> 01:33:53.500]   this up have already picked their winner, so to speak.
[01:33:53.500 --> 01:33:56.060]   And it will be much harder to pull them out.
[01:33:56.060 --> 01:33:57.060]   And the new people...
[01:33:57.060 --> 01:34:01.420]   I just don't think it's a compelling product for an average consumer.
[01:34:01.420 --> 01:34:02.420]   Here is a follow-up video.
[01:34:02.420 --> 01:34:04.820]   I don't know if this is an ad or...
[01:34:04.820 --> 01:34:05.820]   It's a minute long.
[01:34:05.820 --> 01:34:08.540]   It might be an ad, it might be just a follow-up video.
[01:34:08.540 --> 01:34:11.540]   But it speaks directly to a hardware comparison.
[01:34:11.540 --> 01:34:14.300]   This is also from Microsoft.
[01:34:14.300 --> 01:34:16.300]   iPad versus Windows.
[01:34:16.300 --> 01:34:18.300]   Vivo TabArt.
[01:34:18.300 --> 01:34:20.140]   Oh, that's an RT.
[01:34:20.140 --> 01:34:21.140]   That is an RT tablet.
[01:34:21.140 --> 01:34:22.140]   Yeah.
[01:34:22.140 --> 01:34:24.420]   See, the cheapest Surface Pro is $899.
[01:34:24.420 --> 01:34:25.420]   Yeah, you're right.
[01:34:25.420 --> 01:34:26.660]   Well, they're not comparing it to Surface.
[01:34:26.660 --> 01:34:28.180]   They're comparing it to an Asus.
[01:34:28.180 --> 01:34:29.460]   But this is an RT tablet.
[01:34:29.460 --> 01:34:30.460]   That's a different one.
[01:34:30.460 --> 01:34:31.460]   Yeah.
[01:34:31.460 --> 01:34:34.620]   I thought the Vivo was Windows 8 Pro.
[01:34:34.620 --> 01:34:36.620]   It's an Apple...
[01:34:36.620 --> 01:34:37.620]   It's an Apple...
[01:34:37.620 --> 01:34:39.700]   The MacBook Air comparison.
[01:34:39.700 --> 01:34:40.700]   No, it isn't.
[01:34:40.700 --> 01:34:41.700]   Really not.
[01:34:41.700 --> 01:34:44.540]   Yeah, I think Apple has a salient point when they say that they don't want to please you
[01:34:44.540 --> 01:34:48.580]   by giving you a cheap price day one for a product that may or may not be good on day 100.
[01:34:48.580 --> 01:34:50.940]   They want to give you a product that you'll enjoy for the lifespan of that product.
[01:34:50.940 --> 01:34:52.740]   I have to say though, this is pretty compelling.
[01:34:52.740 --> 01:34:55.860]   If you wanted the features like an SD card, I mean, that's compelling.
[01:34:55.860 --> 01:34:59.340]   I don't know if people will look at that and say, "Well, God, I don't need an SD card,
[01:34:59.340 --> 01:35:01.660]   but that's a much better device."
[01:35:01.660 --> 01:35:08.340]   I love the iPad, but that presumes that someone has $400 or $500 or $600 or $700 to spend on
[01:35:08.340 --> 01:35:13.780]   a computer that doesn't do as much as the notebook that they might need for their day-to-day use.
[01:35:13.780 --> 01:35:17.220]   That's fair, but it may let them do more than they could do on that notebook.
[01:35:17.220 --> 01:35:19.020]   I mean, the potential of the device is not the same.
[01:35:19.020 --> 01:35:20.020]   It's not the same.
[01:35:20.020 --> 01:35:21.020]   It's the potential of the person to use that device.
[01:35:21.020 --> 01:35:24.460]   I mean, I think a lot of people do more and a lot of people can do as much on an iPad
[01:35:24.460 --> 01:35:27.620]   as possible where they can't do the same potential on a desktop.
[01:35:27.620 --> 01:35:29.100]   That's why parents do it.
[01:35:29.100 --> 01:35:31.940]   Right, well, a lot of people can, but when you...
[01:35:31.940 --> 01:35:38.100]   I think it's the difference between basic day-to-day equipment and the thing that you
[01:35:38.100 --> 01:35:41.180]   can use that's better than this in some circumstances.
[01:35:41.180 --> 01:35:45.580]   I mean, there's a reason why Toyota sells a lot of four-door sedans.
[01:35:45.580 --> 01:35:47.020]   They're not the prettiest things out there.
[01:35:47.020 --> 01:35:50.740]   They're not the most high-performance things out there.
[01:35:50.740 --> 01:35:56.300]   But when you need to get yourself and two or three kids and some groceries on two hours
[01:35:56.300 --> 01:35:58.900]   over the errands, you don't want the two-seater Tesla.
[01:35:58.900 --> 01:35:59.900]   You want something that's...
[01:35:59.900 --> 01:36:01.380]   You don't want the motorcycle.
[01:36:01.380 --> 01:36:03.100]   You want something like that.
[01:36:03.100 --> 01:36:08.820]   I'm not using this as a way to disparage the iPad, but I'm saying that we have to give
[01:36:08.820 --> 01:36:13.860]   attention to the market that they have X dollars to spend on a home computer that has to do
[01:36:13.860 --> 01:36:15.980]   a lot of things.
[01:36:15.980 --> 01:36:22.380]   I am the guy who travels with an iPad and not my 15-inch $2000 MacBook Pro.
[01:36:22.380 --> 01:36:27.740]   I know where I speak of the things that iPad can do, but when you talk about an average
[01:36:27.740 --> 01:36:32.580]   user who said that, "Well, no, you can't actually use the iPad for this long as you
[01:36:32.580 --> 01:36:33.580]   work around here.
[01:36:33.580 --> 01:36:34.580]   Oh, you have a file?
[01:36:34.580 --> 01:36:38.700]   Okay, here are the steps you have to take in order to get that file off of this common
[01:36:38.700 --> 01:36:40.820]   device you have right now and put it onto that iPad.
[01:36:40.820 --> 01:36:42.340]   Oh, no, you can't just stick it in there.
[01:36:42.340 --> 01:36:47.420]   You have to... everything's so tightly sandboxed that you can't just introduce a file.
[01:36:47.420 --> 01:36:48.420]   Things like that.
[01:36:48.420 --> 01:36:49.420]   So I think there's...
[01:36:49.420 --> 01:36:52.180]   I think you're absolutely right, but I think those people are buying in instead of another
[01:36:52.180 --> 01:36:55.020]   Windows PC and not necessarily instead of an iPad all the time.
[01:36:55.020 --> 01:37:00.540]   So it splits that market rather than it competes directly with the iPad.
[01:37:00.540 --> 01:37:05.660]   I think that we're going to be arguing in circles around each other.
[01:37:05.660 --> 01:37:11.980]   But again, we're kind of close to the end of the show.
[01:37:11.980 --> 01:37:17.020]   I see this as being a more interesting thing that's going to happen in 2013 and 2014 when
[01:37:17.020 --> 01:37:20.860]   Windows 8 gets its act together a little bit better, manufactured right now.
[01:37:20.860 --> 01:37:27.540]   If you want to buy a Windows 8 full-core Windows 8 convertible tablet for the price of
[01:37:27.540 --> 01:37:32.140]   an iPad, you are talking about an Adam processor, not something that's really, really muscular
[01:37:32.140 --> 01:37:34.420]   like a Surface Pro processor.
[01:37:34.420 --> 01:37:41.420]   But I think in 2014 when all these things come together and now I spent $850 for my 64
[01:37:41.420 --> 01:37:48.980]   gig iPad with 3G LTE, when you take that amount of money and see, well, what can I buy for
[01:37:48.980 --> 01:37:50.820]   that in the Windows 8 space?
[01:37:50.820 --> 01:37:54.660]   And when they can finally say, well, here's something that's as well built as an iPad,
[01:37:54.660 --> 01:37:59.380]   does has the same basic range of software as an iPad, but also can be used as your one
[01:37:59.380 --> 01:38:02.700]   and only notebook computer as you travel with.
[01:38:02.700 --> 01:38:04.140]   That's going to be an interesting argument to make.
[01:38:04.140 --> 01:38:05.140]   I agree with that.
[01:38:05.140 --> 01:38:06.140]   I agree with that.
[01:38:06.140 --> 01:38:08.060]   I guess the question is, do they have that much time?
[01:38:08.060 --> 01:38:10.300]   I mean, I think a lot of people that would buy it.
[01:38:10.300 --> 01:38:15.260]   I mean, I think that the issue is that this market is moving very, very fast between Samsung
[01:38:15.260 --> 01:38:17.180]   and Google and Apple.
[01:38:17.180 --> 01:38:20.740]   And I feel like they're just tripping along trying to figure this out.
[01:38:20.740 --> 01:38:26.780]   And again, when I look at the average consumer, when I say average consumer, I think of my
[01:38:26.780 --> 01:38:32.180]   parents and my kids, and they are using tablets way more than they would ever use a laptop.
[01:38:32.180 --> 01:38:37.620]   And my parents never use the computer to sync their iPad.
[01:38:37.620 --> 01:38:42.540]   I mean, that's what they do with it.
[01:38:42.540 --> 01:38:44.740]   And my kids wouldn't touch it.
[01:38:44.740 --> 01:38:47.060]   We'll never know what a keyboard looks like.
[01:38:47.060 --> 01:38:50.500]   Like a physical keyboard, my kids will never grow up with that.
[01:38:50.500 --> 01:38:52.500]   And so, so I think that that--
[01:38:52.500 --> 01:38:54.500]   They're mobile native.
[01:38:54.500 --> 01:38:56.500]   They're not transitioning from computer to computer.
[01:38:56.500 --> 01:38:57.500]   They're not going to understand that.
[01:38:57.500 --> 01:38:59.500]   Wait until they get in the high school, Alex, then say that.
[01:38:59.500 --> 01:39:00.500]   They're not--
[01:39:00.500 --> 01:39:06.220]   I don't think they have the sort of tasks that require them to use something that's different
[01:39:06.220 --> 01:39:07.220]   from what I'm saying.
[01:39:07.220 --> 01:39:08.220]   I don't think that they're ever going to--
[01:39:08.220 --> 01:39:10.820]   I don't think my kids are ever going to know how to use a mouse.
[01:39:10.820 --> 01:39:11.820]   I don't think they're ever going to know how to--
[01:39:11.820 --> 01:39:13.460]   Real life on a keyboard.
[01:39:13.460 --> 01:39:14.460]   No.
[01:39:14.460 --> 01:39:15.460]   Oh, keep a--
[01:39:15.460 --> 01:39:16.460]   Mouse on away.
[01:39:16.460 --> 01:39:18.300]   Mouse I might give you keyboard.
[01:39:18.300 --> 01:39:19.300]   No.
[01:39:19.300 --> 01:39:21.460]   Until-- and it's not only a question of having--
[01:39:21.460 --> 01:39:22.460]   Well, I'm voice-free.
[01:39:22.460 --> 01:39:24.220]   I mean, physical keyboard, like we have it here.
[01:39:24.220 --> 01:39:27.060]   It's going to be some kind of-- you know, there'll be some kind of input device, but
[01:39:27.060 --> 01:39:29.740]   I don't know what that's going to look like, but I don't think it's going to look like
[01:39:29.740 --> 01:39:30.740]   this keyboard.
[01:39:30.740 --> 01:39:33.780]   I mean, I-- you know, it's-- I think that that-- I mean, we're talking-- my kids are
[01:39:33.780 --> 01:39:34.780]   three and five.
[01:39:34.780 --> 01:39:35.780]   We're talking 10 years out.
[01:39:35.860 --> 01:39:39.380]   We look at what happened in the last 10 years and where we're going with voice activation
[01:39:39.380 --> 01:39:40.900]   and everything and contextual information.
[01:39:40.900 --> 01:39:41.900]   I just don't see how that--
[01:39:41.900 --> 01:39:43.900]   Well, they dictate those-- those papers?
[01:39:43.900 --> 01:39:46.500]   How are they going to write those papers?
[01:39:46.500 --> 01:39:47.500]   I do.
[01:39:47.500 --> 01:39:48.500]   I mean, 10-page paper.
[01:39:48.500 --> 01:39:49.500]   How are you going to write that?
[01:39:49.500 --> 01:39:50.500]   Not with a glass keyboard.
[01:39:50.500 --> 01:39:51.500]   You're going to either dictate it.
[01:39:51.500 --> 01:39:52.500]   Right.
[01:39:52.500 --> 01:39:58.740]   I'm just saying the keyboard at this point is 135 years old, I think, and it survived
[01:39:58.740 --> 01:40:01.820]   through transitions of all kinds of things to hook it up to.
[01:40:01.820 --> 01:40:06.100]   I think that we're-- 10 years is a very, very long time of technology terms.
[01:40:06.100 --> 01:40:10.660]   It would be-- I still think it would be a really impressive feat if not only someone
[01:40:10.660 --> 01:40:14.940]   came up with something that was as multi-- as useful and multi-purpose as a keyboard, because
[01:40:14.940 --> 01:40:18.780]   remember, it's not just for putting text in very, very fast, but also moving around an
[01:40:18.780 --> 01:40:20.780]   app very, very fast.
[01:40:20.780 --> 01:40:25.260]   We'd also need a sort of a cultural twist where I am going to want-- I've got eight hours
[01:40:25.260 --> 01:40:30.180]   worth of work to do and I want to sit here speaking into a microphone for eight hours.
[01:40:30.180 --> 01:40:33.340]   I don't even want to be speaking into this microphone for 90 minutes.
[01:40:33.340 --> 01:40:39.820]   And I admit that most people who've emailed me know that my emails are very short.
[01:40:39.820 --> 01:40:41.540]   They're very, very short.
[01:40:41.540 --> 01:40:42.540]   That's because I'm not typing them.
[01:40:42.540 --> 01:40:44.980]   If they're really long, you get a long email from me.
[01:40:44.980 --> 01:40:50.460]   It means that I dictated it because I have damage that was done to my hands from my work
[01:40:50.460 --> 01:40:51.460]   in the past.
[01:40:51.460 --> 01:40:59.500]   And so I can't-- if I type a two-page paper, I can't move my hands for days.
[01:40:59.500 --> 01:41:02.580]   So anyway, so if you get something long for me, it means that it's dictated.
[01:41:02.580 --> 01:41:05.580]   And so I'm very-- I just deal with this all the time.
[01:41:05.580 --> 01:41:09.420]   And there is a lot of stuff that's still kind of rough when you deal with Dragon Software,
[01:41:09.420 --> 01:41:13.540]   for instance, where you're going change that or Backspace or remove that.
[01:41:13.540 --> 01:41:17.180]   And there's a lot of things you move around and do it, but it's still even with that.
[01:41:17.180 --> 01:41:19.940]   And I do edit it with the keyboard.
[01:41:19.940 --> 01:41:25.900]   It is-- I just find myself-- especially even text now, if I'm not sitting in a public place,
[01:41:25.900 --> 01:41:30.060]   it is so much faster when you just hit speak it and I speak the text and then I hit go.
[01:41:30.060 --> 01:41:32.980]   And it's just faster and easier than typing it all out.
[01:41:32.980 --> 01:41:33.980]   I'm the same one.
[01:41:33.980 --> 01:41:34.980]   So 10 years is a long time.
[01:41:34.980 --> 01:41:35.980]   You're right.
[01:41:35.980 --> 01:41:36.980]   Who knows what it will be?
[01:41:36.980 --> 01:41:37.980]   Who knows it will be in 10 years.
[01:41:37.980 --> 01:41:38.980]   Direct brain input.
[01:41:38.980 --> 01:41:39.980]   I would like that.
[01:41:39.980 --> 01:41:40.980]   But you have to think in Russian.
[01:41:40.980 --> 01:41:46.780]   We're going to take a break when we come back, your picks and tips of the day.
[01:41:46.780 --> 01:41:48.140]   I'm going to pick for you right now.
[01:41:48.140 --> 01:41:49.140]   Look at this.
[01:41:49.140 --> 01:41:50.140]   Go to meeting.
[01:41:50.140 --> 01:41:51.660]   They're giving away a webcam.
[01:41:51.660 --> 01:41:53.220]   I'm going to tell you about that in just a second.
[01:41:53.220 --> 01:41:55.340]   Chris, let me tell you about go to meeting.
[01:41:55.340 --> 01:42:01.580]   The best way to hold meetings with colleagues and clients who are not in the same room with
[01:42:01.580 --> 01:42:02.900]   you-- in fact, it happens all the time.
[01:42:02.900 --> 01:42:04.460]   Work is on the go these days.
[01:42:04.460 --> 01:42:07.060]   Alex is in Australia.
[01:42:07.060 --> 01:42:08.180]   Renee is in Montreal.
[01:42:08.180 --> 01:42:11.420]   This is pretty much business as usual.
[01:42:11.420 --> 01:42:14.620]   And while you can't get rid of meetings, the best way to meet is to meet online.
[01:42:14.620 --> 01:42:18.620]   And frankly, maybe better than meeting face to face because with the screen sharing, you're
[01:42:18.620 --> 01:42:19.980]   seeing the same page.
[01:42:19.980 --> 01:42:24.860]   Literally on the same page and now with the HD Faces Video Conference, you're seeing
[01:42:24.860 --> 01:42:27.860]   people in crystal clear, high deaf video.
[01:42:27.860 --> 01:42:31.020]   With go to meeting from Citrix, your team is just a click away.
[01:42:31.020 --> 01:42:34.900]   I know teams that actually keep go to meeting running all day long because they collaborate
[01:42:34.900 --> 01:42:35.900]   all day long.
[01:42:35.900 --> 01:42:39.140]   You can do that because go to meeting is flat rate.
[01:42:39.140 --> 01:42:43.140]   You pay one low flat monthly rate for as many meetings as you want as long as you want.
[01:42:43.140 --> 01:42:47.620]   You can launch or join a meeting from anywhere using your computer, your smartphone, your
[01:42:47.620 --> 01:42:49.940]   tablet, you can even present from your iPad.
[01:42:49.940 --> 01:42:52.060]   That is awfully slick.
[01:42:52.060 --> 01:42:53.380]   I want you to try go to meeting free.
[01:42:53.380 --> 01:42:54.540]   See that orange go to meeting?

[01:43:02.300 --> 01:43:07.460]   And I'd like to give you a webcam just to kind of emphasize the fact that go to meeting
[01:43:07.460 --> 01:43:14.460]   with HD Faces really helps with the face to face in the meeting.
[01:43:14.460 --> 01:43:15.980]   This is the go to meeting webcam.
[01:43:15.980 --> 01:43:18.060]   These are nice webcansis inside here.
[01:43:18.060 --> 01:43:19.060]   You can see it.
[01:43:19.060 --> 01:43:20.060]   It's a Logitech.
[01:43:20.060 --> 01:43:21.060]   Very nice.
[01:43:21.060 --> 01:43:22.820]   Here's the deal.
[01:43:22.820 --> 01:43:24.700]   We want you to tweet us.
[01:43:24.700 --> 01:43:27.020]   This is what we do always with these go to meeting giveaways.
[01:43:27.020 --> 01:43:30.980]   If you could have a meeting with anyone famous living or not using go to meeting with HD
[01:43:30.980 --> 01:43:34.460]   Faces, who would you like to see with HD Faces and why?
[01:43:34.460 --> 01:43:36.420]   We do ask that you use two hashtags.
[01:43:36.420 --> 01:43:40.060]   It's going to mean you have to be fairly succinct in your answer because we're going
[01:43:40.060 --> 01:43:45.020]   to search via hashtag and randomly pick a winner from those entries on Twitter.
[01:43:45.020 --> 01:43:47.540]   #MacBreakWebcam and #GoToMeeting.
[01:43:47.540 --> 01:43:51.380]   Hash, can you put that on the screen chat so people can see it?
[01:43:51.380 --> 01:43:54.540]   Do you have an extra, a little take a take a line and do that.
[01:43:54.540 --> 01:43:57.020]   #MacBreakWebcam #GoToMeeting.
[01:43:57.020 --> 01:44:01.900]   Who would you like to meet with from any time in history living or not and why?
[01:44:01.900 --> 01:44:03.820]   Contest ends June 13th.

[01:44:10.700 --> 01:44:13.540]   on the following Tuesday, June 18th.

[01:44:20.140 --> 01:44:21.700]   Contest is only open to US residents.
[01:44:21.700 --> 01:44:26.380]   I'm sorry, that's just the way it has to be because of lawyers.
[01:44:26.380 --> 01:44:28.340]   But do try GoToMeeting free today.
[01:44:28.340 --> 01:44:29.340]   That's available to anybody.
[01:44:29.340 --> 01:44:31.540]   GoToMeeting.com, use the offer code MacBreaken.
[01:44:31.540 --> 01:44:36.980]   Again if you want to tweet to us, who would you like to meet using GoToMeeting?
[01:44:36.980 --> 01:44:39.260]   Anyone famous living or not?
[01:44:39.260 --> 01:44:40.660]   Who and why?
[01:44:40.660 --> 01:44:43.420]   #MacBreakWebcam #GoToMeeting.
[01:44:43.420 --> 01:44:47.860]   Make sure you get those hashtags in there because otherwise we won't be able to find your entry.
[01:44:47.860 --> 01:44:50.500]   Leo do you want to know how we use GoToMeeting?
[01:44:50.500 --> 01:44:52.140]   Yeah how do you use it?
[01:44:52.140 --> 01:44:53.500]   We use it every day.
[01:44:53.500 --> 01:44:54.940]   That's how it is.
[01:44:54.940 --> 01:45:00.380]   Well so we use GoToMeeting as actually the backbone for our comm system.
[01:45:00.380 --> 01:45:06.260]   So we do a lot of events where people are in many countries at one time and sometimes
[01:45:06.260 --> 01:45:08.380]   we have teams that are at every location.
[01:45:08.380 --> 01:45:11.900]   So literally there's a person there with a camera and gear and everything else.
[01:45:11.900 --> 01:45:15.620]   And to keep a back channel so that we can all talk together and we can have our producers
[01:45:15.620 --> 01:45:18.860]   be able to just call in and be on the same channel.
[01:45:18.860 --> 01:45:22.260]   We actually use the GoToMeeting and one of the big reasons is because we can have IP.
[01:45:22.260 --> 01:45:27.820]   So we'll have sound devices, device or whatever and we'll actually take that XLR out and route
[01:45:27.820 --> 01:45:32.500]   it back into these big comm systems that we have that tie everybody back into the room.
[01:45:32.500 --> 01:45:34.940]   So if you ever see those shows where everyone's got a little headset.
[01:45:34.940 --> 01:45:38.900]   So the backbone that we use to actually connect all those people, when it's really complex
[01:45:38.900 --> 01:45:41.660]   we use another really expensive piece of software that's like thousands of dollars.
[01:45:41.660 --> 01:45:46.220]   But when we're doing simple events, which is 90% of them, we actually use GoToMeeting
[01:45:46.220 --> 01:45:51.980]   to tie all those locations together for international productions and national productions.
[01:45:51.980 --> 01:45:54.180]   And so it's great.
[01:45:54.180 --> 01:45:58.300]   It pays for itself every month.
[01:45:58.300 --> 01:46:03.820]   And because we tie so many locations together we actually have another version of it that's
[01:46:03.820 --> 01:46:04.820]   more robust.
[01:46:04.820 --> 01:46:08.020]   But it is GoToMeeting from Citrix.
[01:46:08.020 --> 01:46:13.020]   And that's pretty good.
[01:46:13.020 --> 01:46:18.020]   We use Google Hangouts a lot too.
[01:46:18.020 --> 01:46:19.140]   We use the screen sharing too.
[01:46:19.140 --> 01:46:25.380]   So while we're doing the Google Hangout, this is literally just for the audio so that while
[01:46:25.380 --> 01:46:30.980]   we're doing the Google Hangout for instance, we've got all of the producers working everywhere
[01:46:30.980 --> 01:46:37.980]   on an audio backbone that's easy to interface and nice and clean and very low bandwidth.
[01:46:37.980 --> 01:46:39.860]   And everything else is not the actual event.
[01:46:39.860 --> 01:46:42.980]   We don't actually use GoToMeeting for the actual like the way most people would think
[01:46:42.980 --> 01:46:43.980]   of it.
[01:46:43.980 --> 01:46:45.620]   We just use it as this kind of geeky back end.
[01:46:45.620 --> 01:46:46.620]   That's cool.
[01:46:46.620 --> 01:46:52.860]   That ties in all of our pro comm systems and these clear comm systems that we just have
[01:46:52.860 --> 01:46:57.660]   these little interfaces that tie it back into the comms and ties people from all over the
[01:46:57.660 --> 01:46:59.260]   world together for productions.
[01:46:59.260 --> 01:47:01.580]   Anyway, I just thought that people might find that.
[01:47:01.580 --> 01:47:02.580]   Thank you, Coley.
[01:47:02.580 --> 01:47:03.580]   Interesting.
[01:47:03.580 --> 01:47:04.580]   It's goToMeeting.com.
[01:47:04.580 --> 01:47:06.420]   Use the offer code MACBRAKE.
[01:47:06.420 --> 01:47:12.820]   And then we'll put the Twitter tags up for you later so you can get them because they're
[01:47:12.820 --> 01:47:13.820]   complicated.
[01:47:13.820 --> 01:47:14.820]   I want you to get them right that way.
[01:47:14.820 --> 01:47:16.900]   You can be in the drawing for the webcam.
[01:47:16.900 --> 01:47:20.980]   Let us get your picks of the week starting with you and D and not co.
[01:47:20.980 --> 01:47:22.660]   My pick is kind of something simple.
[01:47:22.660 --> 01:47:24.460]   I've got it on the screen behind me.
[01:47:24.460 --> 01:47:26.980]   Google Trends is the Google product that we'll show you.
[01:47:26.980 --> 01:47:30.420]   Here's what people are searching for on Google, the topics that they were looking at.
[01:47:30.420 --> 01:47:33.700]   So they recently updated a few days ago and one of the features they added was this really
[01:47:33.700 --> 01:47:37.460]   cool full-screen web app mode.
[01:47:37.460 --> 01:47:42.060]   I'm always looking for cool things to have a screen doing when I need the computer to
[01:47:42.060 --> 01:47:44.860]   be on, but I'm not actually using it right now.
[01:47:44.860 --> 01:47:46.620]   And so it's cool to be seeing.
[01:47:46.620 --> 01:47:50.420]   Here's what people are searching for on Google, the entire world.
[01:47:50.420 --> 01:47:52.700]   Liberace was a big trending topic.
[01:47:52.700 --> 01:47:54.500]   Did you watch that last night?
[01:47:54.500 --> 01:47:55.980]   That was a terrible movie, boy.
[01:47:55.980 --> 01:47:59.060]   I didn't think it was terrible.
[01:47:59.060 --> 01:48:02.340]   I thought it was really cool seeing Michael Douglas doing a role that you don't really
[01:48:02.340 --> 01:48:04.860]   typically see him in.
[01:48:04.860 --> 01:48:06.820]   I don't know.
[01:48:06.820 --> 01:48:07.820]   It was interesting.
[01:48:07.820 --> 01:48:09.820]   Also Rob Lowe with like his--
[01:48:09.820 --> 01:48:10.820]   Rob Lowe was awesome.
[01:48:10.820 --> 01:48:12.460]   He stretched like absolutely.
[01:48:12.460 --> 01:48:13.460]   That was good.
[01:48:13.460 --> 01:48:14.700]   That was scary.
[01:48:14.700 --> 01:48:16.420]   I thought it was fun.
[01:48:16.420 --> 01:48:18.180]   Bill Murray was good in it.
[01:48:18.180 --> 01:48:19.180]   It was just a boring story.
[01:48:19.180 --> 01:48:22.140]   Bill Murray was a Seymour.
[01:48:22.140 --> 01:48:23.140]   The lawyer.
[01:48:23.140 --> 01:48:24.420]   No, no, no, that was Dan Aykroyd.
[01:48:24.420 --> 01:48:25.420]   I mean, did I say Bill Murray?
[01:48:25.420 --> 01:48:26.420]   Dan Aykroyd, thank you.
[01:48:26.420 --> 01:48:27.420]   Dan Aykroyd, right.
[01:48:27.420 --> 01:48:28.420]   All Riser was in it.
[01:48:28.420 --> 01:48:29.420]   All Riser was in it.
[01:48:29.420 --> 01:48:30.420]   Yeah.
[01:48:30.420 --> 01:48:31.420]   A lot of that's a little camera.
[01:48:31.420 --> 01:48:32.420]   I enjoyed it.
[01:48:32.420 --> 01:48:33.660]   I expected it to like it.
[01:48:33.660 --> 01:48:36.980]   I expected it to like it because it was going to be just like 90 minutes of camp, two hours
[01:48:36.980 --> 01:48:37.980]   of camp.
[01:48:37.980 --> 01:48:40.260]   But it was actually very, very sweet story.
[01:48:40.260 --> 01:48:41.260]   Yeah.
[01:48:41.260 --> 01:48:45.580]   It's a weird watching Matt Damon and Michael Douglas make out.
[01:48:45.580 --> 01:48:47.780]   That is a very, very beautiful couple.
[01:48:47.780 --> 01:48:48.780]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:48:48.780 --> 01:48:51.500]   I'm like cheated on Ben Affleck.
[01:48:51.500 --> 01:48:52.500]   Yeah.
[01:48:52.500 --> 01:48:56.980]   You know, I don't think Liberace could have gotten, you know, done at the Liberace even
[01:48:56.980 --> 01:48:58.460]   like the peak of his earning power.
[01:48:58.460 --> 01:49:01.380]   He could have rated, you know, a Matt Damon.
[01:49:01.380 --> 01:49:04.180]   I don't want to be grudging for anything, but you know.
[01:49:04.180 --> 01:49:09.300]   And that's, you know, I'm not gay, but him getting out of the polls like, all right,
[01:49:09.300 --> 01:49:11.340]   I do understand the appeal.
[01:49:11.340 --> 01:49:12.820]   Nice, nice cheeks.
[01:49:12.820 --> 01:49:14.540]   Of being into guys.
[01:49:14.540 --> 01:49:15.540]   Yes.
[01:49:15.540 --> 01:49:16.540]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:49:16.540 --> 01:49:18.580]   It's fun.
[01:49:18.580 --> 01:49:20.180]   It's fun to, this is Google Trends.
[01:49:20.180 --> 01:49:22.100]   Chad's getting us back on topic.
[01:49:22.100 --> 01:49:27.540]   Google.com/trans and there's a checkbox where you can see the full live.
[01:49:27.540 --> 01:49:28.900]   Yeah, you can select it.
[01:49:28.900 --> 01:49:32.540]   You can select the region of the world, including the entire world, and you can choose to have
[01:49:32.540 --> 01:49:35.660]   just one big tile or the whole big Brady bunch sort of--
[01:49:35.660 --> 01:49:40.220]   You're doing the global one I can tell, Chad, because I'm seeing all sorts of interesting
[01:49:40.220 --> 01:49:41.220]   internationals.
[01:49:41.220 --> 01:49:42.780]   It's a weird moon man languages, you know.
[01:49:42.780 --> 01:49:43.780]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:49:43.780 --> 01:49:47.580]   You have Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Russia.
[01:49:47.580 --> 01:49:48.580]   That's cool.
[01:49:48.580 --> 01:49:50.500]   Really neat, United States, UK.
[01:49:50.500 --> 01:49:51.500]   All regions.
[01:49:51.500 --> 01:49:52.500]   You must be doing all regions.
[01:49:52.500 --> 01:49:53.500]   PG-friendly.
[01:49:53.500 --> 01:49:56.340]   I just switched to Canada, see what they're talking about.
[01:49:56.340 --> 01:49:57.340]   Currently.
[01:49:57.340 --> 01:50:02.500]   Ottawa Race Weekend, Skagit River Bridge, Halifax Mooseheads.
[01:50:02.500 --> 01:50:04.660]   Yep, that's got to be the Canadian one.
[01:50:04.660 --> 01:50:05.660]   Yep, yep.
[01:50:05.660 --> 01:50:07.900]   Let's go to Montreal, speaking of that.
[01:50:07.900 --> 01:50:09.660]   And Renee Ritchie, your pick of the week.
[01:50:09.660 --> 01:50:13.820]   Now, I was certain that I picked this before, but I searched and I couldn't find it.
[01:50:13.820 --> 01:50:18.140]   So I apologize if it's a repeat, but it's especially valuable this time of year.
[01:50:18.140 --> 01:50:21.860]   And it's an app called Glassboard, and it's by Brent Simmons, who did NetU's Wire.
[01:50:21.860 --> 01:50:22.860]   Love it.
[01:50:22.860 --> 01:50:23.860]   Love it.
[01:50:23.860 --> 01:50:24.860]   Yeah.
[01:50:24.860 --> 01:50:27.620]   It's iOS, it's Android, and it's the web.
[01:50:27.620 --> 01:50:29.900]   And it creates sort of private rooms.
[01:50:29.900 --> 01:50:30.900]   And there's a free tier.
[01:50:30.900 --> 01:50:32.100]   There's also a paid tier.
[01:50:32.100 --> 01:50:34.620]   I pay for it so I can have unlimited rooms.
[01:50:34.620 --> 01:50:37.100]   But it's incredibly useful at conferences.
[01:50:37.100 --> 01:50:39.380]   I'm getting a room ready for WWDC.
[01:50:39.380 --> 01:50:42.700]   So we're going to have several people from I'm more there.
[01:50:42.700 --> 01:50:44.300]   And we can keep track of what everyone's doing.
[01:50:44.300 --> 01:50:46.700]   We're going to have people at E3, and I can have a room for that.
[01:50:46.700 --> 01:50:50.700]   Can I ask you, though, now that Google Hangouts is out, if it doesn't hangouts, kind of do
[01:50:50.700 --> 01:50:53.980]   the same thing, the text-based?
[01:50:53.980 --> 01:50:58.460]   It does, but there's going to be times when I'm busy enough and I'm going to want to silence
[01:50:58.460 --> 01:50:59.460]   Google Hangouts.
[01:50:59.460 --> 01:51:04.540]   And so few people are going to be-- or so specific people will be in Glassboard that
[01:51:04.540 --> 01:51:08.780]   I can leave that on when I turn off Twitter and I turn off Google+, especially when I'm
[01:51:08.780 --> 01:51:12.220]   roaming or when I'm live blogging or doing something else.
[01:51:12.220 --> 01:51:16.100]   So it just becomes an urgency filter for me.
[01:51:16.100 --> 01:51:20.980]   And the other nice thing is the way it's built, we're starting to use it to do beta testing
[01:51:20.980 --> 01:51:26.500]   for the third version of the iMore app, because people can ask for features, they can log
[01:51:26.500 --> 01:51:29.620]   problems, they can add images, they can annotate things.
[01:51:29.620 --> 01:51:32.460]   And it goes to a very specific group of testers.
[01:51:32.460 --> 01:51:35.900]   And you can just leave it open doing those things where Google Hangouts, I'm going to
[01:51:35.900 --> 01:51:37.860]   do a bunch of other stuff with.
[01:51:37.860 --> 01:51:39.660]   So I'm a huge fan of it.
[01:51:39.660 --> 01:51:42.820]   Brent does amazing software, and it's been very useful so far.
[01:51:42.820 --> 01:51:44.020]   Yeah, I love it.
[01:51:44.020 --> 01:51:49.180]   I just wonder how much I have a feeling he kind of ran into a buzz cell with Google Hangouts.
[01:51:49.180 --> 01:51:53.740]   As did what's app and every other kind of text based group.
[01:51:53.740 --> 01:51:57.820]   The other thing is that a lot of people don't want to use a Google product for something
[01:51:57.820 --> 01:52:00.820]   that could be very private back-channel communications.
[01:52:00.820 --> 01:52:04.420]   So I like that product because there's a way that it's private, private, private, they're
[01:52:04.420 --> 01:52:05.420]   not going to sell ads.
[01:52:05.420 --> 01:52:08.340]   They have no interest in who you're talking to and what times and when.
[01:52:08.340 --> 01:52:11.980]   ICON has a lock on it so you know that it's private and you have very granular control
[01:52:11.980 --> 01:52:13.820]   over who gets access to what.
[01:52:13.820 --> 01:52:16.140]   It's encrypted, so that's good.
[01:52:16.140 --> 01:52:17.140]   Yeah.
[01:52:17.140 --> 01:52:18.140]   It is encrypted or not?
[01:52:18.140 --> 01:52:20.020]   I believe it is.
[01:52:20.020 --> 01:52:22.020]   I think last time I checked it out, it was.
[01:52:22.020 --> 01:52:23.020]   Sure privately.
[01:52:23.020 --> 01:52:26.780]   No privacy settings because everything is private.
[01:52:26.780 --> 01:52:30.340]   As private by default, which is nice because I've made mistakes on Google Hangouts.
[01:52:30.340 --> 01:52:33.780]   And ironically, Google Hangouts is so much easier to use on mobile and now it's much
[01:52:33.780 --> 01:52:37.100]   more complicated on the web and this just keeps it all in one simple place.
[01:52:37.100 --> 01:52:40.140]   I do want to see the word encrypted, which I don't see.
[01:52:40.140 --> 01:52:41.140]   I'll check with him.
[01:52:41.140 --> 01:52:42.140]   Yes, Brent.
[01:52:42.140 --> 01:52:43.340]   Of course, it's got to be encrypted.
[01:52:43.340 --> 01:52:48.020]   I mean, that's the big story with Skype is that apparently what we thought were encrypted
[01:52:48.020 --> 01:52:50.900]   chats are not on Skype.
[01:52:50.900 --> 01:52:55.060]   So that would be an opportunity for a company like Glassboard provided they were encrypting.
[01:52:55.060 --> 01:53:00.140]   Also, they tend to be very responsive to the particular needs of their users where Google
[01:53:00.140 --> 01:53:01.540]   Hangout is going to have to apply.
[01:53:01.540 --> 01:53:02.540]   Right.
[01:53:02.540 --> 01:53:03.540]   It's such a large crowd.
[01:53:03.540 --> 01:53:06.500]   They're going to make a bunch of concessions for that and Glassboard has an incredibly small
[01:53:06.500 --> 01:53:08.980]   focus so they can be very specific to that.
[01:53:08.980 --> 01:53:10.460]   I'm just looking at it.
[01:53:10.460 --> 01:53:11.460]   I think it is encrypted.
[01:53:11.460 --> 01:53:13.140]   It sure does imply that it's encrypted.
[01:53:13.140 --> 01:53:15.620]   I'll double check, but I believe I asked before.
[01:53:15.620 --> 01:53:17.060]   I'm looking at the privacy statement.
[01:53:17.060 --> 01:53:21.100]   It does seem like they don't just let you put a lock on an icon.
[01:53:21.100 --> 01:53:22.100]   Come on.
[01:53:22.100 --> 01:53:27.420]   "Incryptic Glassboard data is decrypted only on our production servers."
[01:53:27.420 --> 01:53:31.060]   So it's encrypted, but they have access.
[01:53:31.060 --> 01:53:34.780]   I'll follow up on that just to make sure.
[01:53:34.780 --> 01:53:35.780]   No, no.
[01:53:35.780 --> 01:53:37.300]   That's the story.
[01:53:37.300 --> 01:53:38.300]   It's using encryption.
[01:53:38.300 --> 01:53:44.140]   There are certificates, but CPLabs employees, some, a restricted number have access to the
[01:53:44.140 --> 01:53:45.340]   certificates.
[01:53:45.340 --> 01:53:49.100]   They're strictly prohibited from using that access except in the case of catastrophic
[01:53:49.100 --> 01:53:52.780]   system failure or in compliance with law enforcement.
[01:53:52.780 --> 01:53:56.300]   So just so you know, you should know, that's what it means.
[01:53:56.300 --> 01:53:57.700]   Unfortunately, that's the stat.
[01:53:57.700 --> 01:54:01.060]   I mean, this Google Hangouts is the same, but that's the status nowadays with everything.
[01:54:01.060 --> 01:54:02.540]   And I think it's unfortunate.
[01:54:02.540 --> 01:54:08.300]   And Skype, of course, has never implied that it's any different either.
[01:54:08.300 --> 01:54:12.380]   Glassboard, Brett Simmons is available, Android, iOS, and of course on the web.
[01:54:12.380 --> 01:54:15.940]   And now, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Alex Lindsey's pick of the week.
[01:54:15.940 --> 01:54:20.100]   So I don't think that I've talked about this in the past, but a lot of people ask about
[01:54:20.100 --> 01:54:21.300]   what I put on my laptop.
[01:54:21.300 --> 01:54:26.580]   So we have a lot of laptops and we drop them, bang them, smash them.
[01:54:26.580 --> 01:54:30.900]   And one thing that we, there's two different cases that we use that I use for my laptops.
[01:54:30.900 --> 01:54:34.220]   The ones that I put most of my computers on are these spec cases.
[01:54:34.220 --> 01:54:35.220]   Have you seen them?
[01:54:35.220 --> 01:54:36.220]   I love those and I use them.
[01:54:36.220 --> 01:54:37.220]   Yeah.
[01:54:37.220 --> 01:54:38.220]   I love them too.
[01:54:38.220 --> 01:54:40.540]   You know, it really does make a difference.
[01:54:40.540 --> 01:54:44.100]   These unibody Macs are fragile, in my opinion.
[01:54:44.100 --> 01:54:46.500]   I mean, compared to how I guess how we use them anyway.
[01:54:46.500 --> 01:54:47.860]   That's the aluminum dings.
[01:54:47.860 --> 01:54:51.100]   I don't think they're fragile in terms like they would smash.
[01:54:51.100 --> 01:54:55.700]   No, they don't smash, but you get lots of dings and you can very quickly, I've had this
[01:54:55.700 --> 01:54:57.060]   one go off the table.
[01:54:57.060 --> 01:54:58.060]   Yeah.
[01:54:58.060 --> 01:55:03.180]   And it would have left one of those nasty dents, you know, in the lower corner or something
[01:55:03.180 --> 01:55:04.180]   where it hit.
[01:55:04.180 --> 01:55:08.020]   And instead, it's protected by this and just a lot less scratch, especially if you think
[01:55:08.020 --> 01:55:12.340]   you're ever going to send this to, you know, Gazelle or something like that.
[01:55:12.340 --> 01:55:17.020]   Like at this point, I buy these when I'm buying my Mac, you know, like it's, I wanted
[01:55:17.020 --> 01:55:18.620]   to be pristine when it goes in.
[01:55:18.620 --> 01:55:23.860]   Now, another one that I really gotten kind of into is this, this in case.
[01:55:23.860 --> 01:55:25.420]   So the cool thing about this in case is the texture.
[01:55:25.420 --> 01:55:26.420]   Yeah, look at that.
[01:55:26.420 --> 01:55:27.740]   It looks like a crocodile.
[01:55:27.740 --> 01:55:31.620]   So this is my, this is my little air that I use in economy.
[01:55:31.620 --> 01:55:36.380]   And, and it's just, I really like the, the, the popped area.
[01:55:36.380 --> 01:55:37.380]   I don't know.
[01:55:37.380 --> 01:55:39.820]   It sticks out and I can grab it and, you know, it's, I don't know.
[01:55:39.820 --> 01:55:40.820]   I like it.
[01:55:40.820 --> 01:55:44.900]   You can't put stickers on it like you can with the other one, but, but it's, it's really
[01:55:44.900 --> 01:55:45.900]   cool.
[01:55:45.900 --> 01:55:46.900]   And this is made by in case.
[01:55:46.900 --> 01:55:48.380]   Well, those are pretty, they have some pretty designs too.
[01:55:48.380 --> 01:55:49.380]   Yeah.
[01:55:49.380 --> 01:55:53.700]   So I think those are two, but, but I highly suggest, you know, you know, I, I've gotten
[01:55:53.700 --> 01:55:56.620]   to the point where we use them so much and they protected our computers so much from
[01:55:56.620 --> 01:56:00.300]   things when you see a bare computer, you're just, you just want to grab on to somebody
[01:56:00.300 --> 01:56:02.500]   and say, stop the insanity.
[01:56:02.500 --> 01:56:04.620]   Get a case.
[01:56:04.620 --> 01:56:05.620]   You know.
[01:56:05.620 --> 01:56:11.580]   And the other thing is that like every, I was not a fan of these cases until like after,
[01:56:11.580 --> 01:56:13.860]   after airport security got a little bit more tight.
[01:56:13.860 --> 01:56:17.940]   And the first time I had to like think twice before figuring out which of these tubs that
[01:56:17.940 --> 01:56:20.140]   has an identical aluminum vacuum.
[01:56:20.140 --> 01:56:21.140]   Oh, okay.
[01:56:21.140 --> 01:56:22.140]   Sorry.
[01:56:22.140 --> 01:56:24.220]   And the other thing, that's what that was, that was, I'm sorry.
[01:56:24.220 --> 01:56:27.140]   That was when they had the tie books and that when they made that change, that's when I
[01:56:27.140 --> 01:56:28.420]   started putting stickers on them.
[01:56:28.420 --> 01:56:29.420]   But it's the same thing.
[01:56:29.420 --> 01:56:30.420]   I've always put a case on these things.
[01:56:30.420 --> 01:56:33.220]   You get these, you get these cases and then you throw stickers all over it.
[01:56:33.220 --> 01:56:36.740]   Like the one that I'm talking on right now has stickers all, you know, a couple of stickers
[01:56:36.740 --> 01:56:37.740]   on the back.
[01:56:37.740 --> 01:56:44.220]   And so it's very clear that it's my, it's my case and which is important for us too.
[01:56:44.220 --> 01:56:45.220]   And so it's great.
[01:56:45.220 --> 01:56:49.220]   You're not feeling like you're going to have to get rid of all that, that gum later off
[01:56:49.220 --> 01:56:51.020]   of your, off the back of your computer.
[01:56:51.020 --> 01:56:53.100]   So anyway, that's it.
[01:56:53.100 --> 01:56:54.660]   Very nice ladies and gentlemen.
[01:56:54.660 --> 01:56:57.340]   This concludes this edition of Mac Break Weekly.
[01:56:57.340 --> 01:57:00.300]   I want to thank Alex Lindsey of the Pixel Corp for joining us as always.
[01:57:00.300 --> 01:57:04.900]   This time in the very early hours of the morning from Austria, we're in Austria, Sydney.
[01:57:04.900 --> 01:57:05.900]   I've been Sydney.
[01:57:05.900 --> 01:57:06.900]   I'm right off of Darling Harbor.
[01:57:06.900 --> 01:57:07.900]   It's so beautiful.
[01:57:07.900 --> 01:57:08.900]   Isn't that a beautiful city?
[01:57:08.900 --> 01:57:09.900]   It is really.
[01:57:09.900 --> 01:57:13.420]   I mean, I walk everywhere and people are like, you know, you can get a cab.
[01:57:13.420 --> 01:57:15.580]   You know, I'm like, oh, it's just a gorgeous walk.
[01:57:15.580 --> 01:57:18.300]   You know, it's just, it's a Sydney is stuff.
[01:57:18.300 --> 01:57:19.300]   We were there in the spring though.
[01:57:19.300 --> 01:57:21.100]   You're in there in the fall.
[01:57:21.100 --> 01:57:23.660]   It's like the, yeah, it's, but it's not, it's still 70 degrees out.
[01:57:23.660 --> 01:57:24.660]   I mean, it's not.
[01:57:24.660 --> 01:57:25.660]   Yeah.
[01:57:25.660 --> 01:57:26.660]   Yeah, it's very pleasant.
[01:57:26.660 --> 01:57:27.660]   It's a little chilly in the evening.
[01:57:27.660 --> 01:57:28.660]   It's been raining a little bit here and there.
[01:57:28.660 --> 01:57:34.020]   But overall, I mean, it's just such a, especially in this one little area here is just, just
[01:57:34.020 --> 01:57:35.900]   this unbelievable place to just walk around.
[01:57:35.900 --> 01:57:36.900]   I love Australia.
[01:57:36.900 --> 01:57:40.900]   I wish it were closer, but on the other hand, that keeps out the riff-raff.
[01:57:40.900 --> 01:57:42.860]   Like us.
[01:57:42.860 --> 01:57:43.860]   Like us.
[01:57:43.860 --> 01:57:46.060]   It's a long way to go.
[01:57:46.060 --> 01:57:49.300]   Yeah, it's a, it's a great, great, great location.
[01:57:49.300 --> 01:57:50.460]   We're thrilled you could be here.
[01:57:50.460 --> 01:57:51.460]   Thank you.
[01:57:51.460 --> 01:57:52.460]   And now, now the sun is up.
[01:57:52.460 --> 01:57:53.460]   You can go out and enjoy the day.
[01:57:53.460 --> 01:57:55.460]   Not yet, but it'll be here eventually.
[01:57:55.460 --> 01:57:56.460]   Any day, right?
[01:57:56.460 --> 01:58:01.500]   Yeah. From Montreal, where it's always snowing, Mr. Renee.
[01:58:01.500 --> 01:58:02.500]   Renee Richie.
[01:58:02.500 --> 01:58:05.300]   No, I bet spring is sprung in Montreal.
[01:58:05.300 --> 01:58:06.460]   It's, you know, it's too extreme.
[01:58:06.460 --> 01:58:08.500]   It's either minus 40 Celsius or plus 40 Celsius.
[01:58:08.500 --> 01:58:09.500]   Right.
[01:58:09.500 --> 01:58:10.900]   You take it very few days in between.
[01:58:10.900 --> 01:58:14.860]   When I was in Toronto, Amber MacArthur was always saying, it's patio weather.
[01:58:14.860 --> 01:58:17.180]   That meant, that was meant it was above freezing, basically.
[01:58:17.180 --> 01:58:18.180]   Yes.
[01:58:18.180 --> 01:58:19.180]   Yeah.
[01:58:19.180 --> 01:58:20.180]   Amber is very smart about it.
[01:58:20.180 --> 01:58:21.180]   Patio weather.
[01:58:21.180 --> 01:58:22.180]   Thank you, Renee.
[01:58:22.180 --> 01:58:23.180]   Renee is at imore.com.
[01:58:23.180 --> 01:58:25.380]   They also do a crackberry.
[01:58:25.380 --> 01:58:29.580]   What is the Android Central and WP Central for Windows Phone?
[01:58:29.580 --> 01:58:31.300]   Oh, you do a Windows phone say?
[01:58:31.300 --> 01:58:32.300]   Yes, sir.
[01:58:32.300 --> 01:58:33.300]   You know, I'm going to have to check it out.
[01:58:33.300 --> 01:58:36.140]   I got the Lumia 928, the Verizon version.
[01:58:36.140 --> 01:58:38.180]   It's actually kind of a nice phone.
[01:58:38.180 --> 01:58:40.420]   I'm getting the 925 as soon as it's available.
[01:58:40.420 --> 01:58:42.420]   Yeah, the 925 is going to be even more beautiful.
[01:58:42.420 --> 01:58:43.420]   It's all aluminum.
[01:58:43.420 --> 01:58:44.420]   Yeah.
[01:58:44.420 --> 01:58:45.420]   Yeah.
[01:58:45.420 --> 01:58:47.540]   I keep thinking, I wish they could put Android on.
[01:58:47.540 --> 01:58:49.900]   Everyone's making good phones now, Leo.
[01:58:49.900 --> 01:58:51.340]   You know, that's the good news.
[01:58:51.340 --> 01:58:55.340]   No matter who your carrier is, there's something great that you have to check out.
[01:58:55.340 --> 01:58:56.340]   It's a choice.
[01:58:56.340 --> 01:58:57.340]   Yeah.
[01:58:57.340 --> 01:58:58.340]   It's just fabulous.
[01:58:58.340 --> 01:58:59.340]   Yeah.
[01:58:59.340 --> 01:59:00.340]   And that's kind of the bottom line.
[01:59:00.340 --> 01:59:04.500]   Mr. Andy Inaco, who will probably never use a Windows phone, but nevertheless, if you
[01:59:04.500 --> 01:59:06.580]   do, I'm sure there'll be a lot of attention.
[01:59:06.580 --> 01:59:12.980]   HTC is coming out with rumored one in July that will have Nokia's new like peer review
[01:59:12.980 --> 01:59:18.940]   image sensor for like 20 megapixel, 40 megapixel sensor, a down samples down to 22.
[01:59:18.940 --> 01:59:25.300]   And if it's good, and if it's good, like, oh, I would like a camera.
[01:59:25.300 --> 01:59:26.900]   That's better than the iPhone's camera.
[01:59:26.900 --> 01:59:28.380]   This camera I have is the Lumia.
[01:59:28.380 --> 01:59:29.620]   I have to say it is the best camera.
[01:59:29.620 --> 01:59:30.820]   I do like the HTC one.
[01:59:30.820 --> 01:59:33.700]   That's an interesting choice because it's a four megapixel camera.
[01:59:33.700 --> 01:59:38.180]   They went the other way better, better, not more better pictures, not more megapixels.
[01:59:38.180 --> 01:59:39.180]   That's what everybody's doing.
[01:59:39.180 --> 01:59:41.060]   I'm pretty happy with the images on it.
[01:59:41.060 --> 01:59:43.020]   Does it do good low light?
[01:59:43.020 --> 01:59:44.020]   Much better low light.
[01:59:44.020 --> 01:59:45.020]   Yeah.
[01:59:45.020 --> 01:59:47.100]   Some say doesn't do good to do as well in bright light.
[01:59:47.100 --> 01:59:48.180]   I think it does well in bright light.
[01:59:48.180 --> 01:59:49.180]   It's just four megapixels.
[01:59:49.180 --> 01:59:52.580]   So it's not going to be, you're not going to make a poster out of it.
[01:59:52.580 --> 01:59:53.580]   Right.
[01:59:53.580 --> 01:59:56.740]   So two micron pixels is an interesting way to go.
[01:59:56.740 --> 01:59:59.180]   I'm very curious what Apple is going to do with the iPhone 5S.
[01:59:59.180 --> 02:00:05.980]   There's got, they've got to do something that makes you go, oh, they've made a big step forward.
[02:00:05.980 --> 02:00:07.980]   And I just don't want to be a filler-shiller camera segment.
[02:00:07.980 --> 02:00:09.820]   There's always a filler-shiller camera segment.
[02:00:09.820 --> 02:00:15.700]   It's interesting because I was not planning on taking a walk through the park yesterday.
[02:00:15.700 --> 02:00:17.020]   So I didn't have my camera with me.
[02:00:17.020 --> 02:00:18.020]   And I just, oh, damn it.
[02:00:18.020 --> 02:00:20.620]   Not only do I have just a camera phone, I don't have my iPhone with me.
[02:00:20.620 --> 02:00:22.100]   It's just the Samsung.
[02:00:22.100 --> 02:00:24.420]   And when I got home and put these on a big screen, it's like not bad.
[02:00:24.420 --> 02:00:25.700]   Actually, those are very good pictures.
[02:00:25.700 --> 02:00:26.700]   Not bad.
[02:00:26.700 --> 02:00:27.700]   They're fine by me.
[02:00:27.700 --> 02:00:29.340]   Yeah, a lot of detail.
[02:00:29.340 --> 02:00:30.340]   Colors pretty accurate.
[02:00:30.340 --> 02:00:32.500]   Not quite as accurate as the iPhone 5.
[02:00:32.500 --> 02:00:34.580]   But, but, but, I'm sorry, we're starting a new topic.
[02:00:34.580 --> 02:00:39.860]   I will, I'll button this by saying, if you spend a small amount of money for aperture,
[02:00:39.860 --> 02:00:44.780]   the 30% quality difference between any two cameras can be completely negated because you
[02:00:44.780 --> 02:00:47.820]   can fix any color problem, any sharpness problem.
[02:00:47.820 --> 02:00:51.580]   If the pixels are there, you can make a great, great photo out of it.
[02:00:51.580 --> 02:00:52.580]   I agree.
[02:00:52.580 --> 02:00:53.580]   I agree.
[02:00:53.580 --> 02:00:54.580]   Yeah.
[02:00:54.580 --> 02:00:55.580]   And there you go.
[02:00:55.580 --> 02:00:56.580]   There you have it.
[02:00:56.580 --> 02:00:57.580]   That's the button.
[02:00:57.580 --> 02:00:58.580]   He's the man at the Chicago Sun.
[02:00:58.580 --> 02:00:59.580]   Huh?
[02:00:59.580 --> 02:01:00.580]   Unbutton the button.
[02:01:00.580 --> 02:01:01.580]   Go ahead.
[02:01:01.580 --> 02:01:02.580]   Huh?
[02:01:02.580 --> 02:01:03.580]   You can unbutton the button.
[02:01:03.580 --> 02:01:05.580]   Which one is one?
[02:01:05.580 --> 02:01:07.580]   Thank you for joining us.
[02:01:07.580 --> 02:01:12.220]   We do Mac for a weekly 11 AM Pacific, 2 PM Eastern time 18, no 1900 UTC.
[02:01:12.220 --> 02:01:13.300]   I've been doing it wrong all this time.
[02:01:13.300 --> 02:01:15.860]   It's now eight hours plus eight hours to get to UTC.
[02:01:15.860 --> 02:01:19.300]   1900 UTC on Twitch.tv every Tuesday.
[02:01:19.300 --> 02:01:23.500]   But if you can't be here on Tuesday mornings or early afternoons or in the middle of the
[02:01:23.500 --> 02:01:26.780]   night, if you're in Australia, please get the on demand version.
[02:01:26.780 --> 02:01:32.860]   Audio and video always available after the fact of Twitch.tv/mbaw.
[02:01:32.860 --> 02:01:34.220]   And we will be doing live coverage.
[02:01:34.220 --> 02:01:39.500]   As I mentioned in two weeks, June 10th, our coverage will begin at 10 AM Pacific, 2 PM
[02:01:39.500 --> 02:01:48.740]   or 1 PM Eastern time, 1800 UTC on Monday, June 10th of the www WWDC keynote.
[02:01:48.740 --> 02:01:50.260]   I'm going to tune in for that.
[02:01:50.260 --> 02:01:51.660]   And we will not be live blogging.
[02:01:51.660 --> 02:01:54.860]   I mean, Tim Cook on all things D tonight.
[02:01:54.860 --> 02:01:57.580]   You just have to watch Joanna Stern do it at ABC.
[02:01:57.580 --> 02:01:59.500]   I'll be watching too.
[02:01:59.500 --> 02:02:06.260]   I'm not live blogging for one line about something in a new product, some cagey line.
[02:02:06.260 --> 02:02:08.820]   But I will be looking with interest to see what he says because he will say something
[02:02:08.820 --> 02:02:09.820]   tonight.
[02:02:09.820 --> 02:02:10.820]   Thanks everybody.
[02:02:10.820 --> 02:02:11.820]   We'll see you next time now.
[02:02:11.820 --> 02:02:14.020]   Get back to work because break time is over.
