[00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.800]   Security flaw and a look at what?

[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:51.240]   Joining me right now Chicago Sun Times columnist tech reporter and man about town
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.360]   Andy and Aiko who is a is a
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:02.360]   Fitting out his new studio. I love the framed poster of the woman in the 1984 commercial wielding this ledge hammer
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.360]   That is where'd you get that?
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:10.040]   Oh, that's like if you if you look carefully, that's the doc for the anniversary of the iPod
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.680]   They doctored it and added like an iPod. She's wearing an iPod headphones to her on her hip. Yeah
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.000]   And so that's it's it's I'm at I'm at the stage of moving into the new office in the new place where
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.280]   Like my artwork is now like leaning against walls where I might be panging it up
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.920]   It depends if I find better places for it. So it
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.560]   It would give me give me another eight months and I'll finally have nails and walls
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:40.440]   But yes, that's that's a that's a very good candidate is he gonna be shelves or the 1984 lady plus my mac break weekly
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:48.600]   To jonal for that. Yeah, he gave us a wooden so handsome carved versions of our mac break weekly album art and each one had
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.360]   the hosts
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.760]   So it says leo loport and nanny and not co as if
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.560]   Renee richie does not exist. Don't worry Renee. We're not giving you short shrift
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.480]   Renee rich
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.360]   I'm more dot com yeah
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.080]   He has one that says leo loport and Renee richie and
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.800]   You will and is it next week your new studio?
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:11.640]   You still in the old so i'm moving out i'm moving out on friday on thursday and then i'm moving to the next place next friday
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.920]   So you won't you'll see me at some interim place. Maybe george's place next week and then I should be in the new place
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.320]   At least partially said i'll be at andy status
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:25.640]   By the yeah, when that time comes we will acknowledge your new studio. I promise. Thank you. Thank you. We're working on it leo
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.680]   Meltdown inspector
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:35.240]   Uh, what about mac break one week ago? Uh, we kind of actually it's funny right after mac break weekly steve talked about both
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.120]   Problems but in such a
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.600]   Even tone that I didn't
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.600]   I didn't really get the consequences
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.480]   But now we know of course the next day
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:52.280]   The researchers revealed the story. We only knew that something was going on at least right at least a week before the embargo
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:58.040]   Right right well and at least because the linux folks were working on it in public as as open source projects do
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.960]   They redacted commons and stuff but people but smart people were able to look at and go
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:10.360]   They're fixing something pretty significant here. Yeah, yeah, uh, the significance is of course it affects every modern processor
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.960]   In you know all intel processors since 1995 amd 2
[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:20.520]   For about a minute amd got to skate but no it turns out amd 2
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:23.320]   They were all so busy trying to make it sound like it wasn't
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:29.080]   No, like intel was saying everybody it's not just us and amd you saying it's not us and the
[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.680]   Just I think arm was a little honest so they manufactured
[00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:38.520]   The only as far as I know the only computers doesn't affect is your apple watch apple was a great pain to say does not affect the apple watch
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:45.160]   Yeah, and the razberry pie because they're so dumb neither one does speculative execution. Yes
[00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.320]   It's not dumbly. We don't make them feel bad
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:56.680]   Slow this this is this is like that dystopian future in which the resistance has to does everything with play and written notes and typewriters
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:02.920]   That'll start the only way that the system. Yeah, it's the galactica the apple watches the galactica of the tech world
[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.560]   so um
[00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:12.440]   And we've covered it. I think by now I think on every show except this one because we're making full circle and steve's gonna do a full breakdown on
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.680]   Security now today, but just in brief
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.680]   Uh, it takes advantage of a flaw in um all modern processors
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:19.880]   They look ahead
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:24.200]   They say is andi gonna take a left turn or right turn at the next intersection the processor guesses
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:31.080]   I think it's the left turn and then and this is critical loads the level one cache with data that it will need if it
[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:36.760]   Andi takes a left turn and that data is not invisible to other processes running on the processor
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.120]   So the processor can snoop into the future a little bit
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:46.200]   And if that clump of data and the cache happens to contain a password credit card or something of value
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.760]   It can be extracted
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.360]   Uh, it is not analogy
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:55.320]   That reality I heard was imagine like leo every day at midnight goes and makes a snack puts together a sandwich
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.880]   So his computer decides i'm gonna make the sandwich for leo
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:02.120]   It's faster, but then leo just sleeps through the night like oh, we have to quickly put everything back in the fridge
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.880]   But you can see that someone has potted through all the cold drinks and cheese. Yes. Yeah, yeah
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.400]   I was
[00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.680]   Last week I was using the devil doubles where where's prada?
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.080]   I think where you have a really demanding boss
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.720]   You know that when she comes in at 8 15 in the morning
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.120]   She's got to either want coffee or tea
[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.480]   But you're really good assistant so you decide to make you don't know which one it's going to be
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:26.200]   But you know it's going to be one of these two so you make both and then you get rid of the one you don't have to use
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:29.320]   Then you know it's I think I think that it's it's
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:33.960]   There should be like a compilation of analogies made to
[00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:40.360]   Explain one of the most complicated things about system architecture so that it's actually reachable and relevant
[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:46.840]   In any event it's well actually maybe maybe randal gets the the nod for his xk cd column
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.680]   It which which actually boils it down to the most important advice
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:57.480]   So it's a kind of a normal guy and a smart woman the the meltdown spectra exploits use
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.880]   Speculative execution. What's that?
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:02.120]   Well, you know the trolley problem
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:08.120]   Well for a while now cpu has basically been sending trolleys down both paths quantum style while awaiting your choice
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.520]   Then the unneeded phantom trolley disappears
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:15.640]   The phantom trolley isn't supposed to touch anyone but it turns out you could still use it to do stuff
[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.200]   And it can drive through walls
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.280]   That sounds bad
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:23.720]   Honestly, I've been assuming we were doomed ever since I learned about ro hammer
[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.320]   What's that?
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:30.440]   If you toggle a row of memory cells on and off really fast you can use electrical interference to flip nearby bits and
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:33.560]   Do we just suck at computers?
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:39.800]   Yep, especially shared ones. So you're saying the cloud is full of fenn trolleys armed with hammers
[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:43.000]   Yes, that's exactly right
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:48.360]   Okay, I'll um install updates good idea
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:55.400]   Update the good news is in the apple ecosystem. It's a kind of homogenous ecosystem
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.960]   So apple has been able to patch
[00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:04.440]   Everything right they've begun to mitigate so back in december they pushed out ios
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:10.280]   And macos updates and they pushed out new ones already so meltdown is part is mitigae
[00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:12.200]   These things we don't I think we don't know for sure
[00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:19.320]   They're going to keep doing mitigations for these things but they've at least begun to mitigate meltdown and now yesterday in safari for ios
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:25.880]   And macos and going back three versions of macos they've done mitigations for specter apple tv doesn't have web kit surface
[00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:28.600]   So it doesn't need those they pointed out and this was a little scary that
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:33.080]   Specter is can be done through a browser and javascript
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:36.600]   So browsers have to be patched to prevent that
[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:39.400]   And the reason that's scary
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:46.520]   Is think about the attack surface here you you either have to get somebody to get some program on your some rogue program on your system
[00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:49.720]   That's running at the same time as you're doing other stuff to do the snooping
[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:53.560]   If you're on a shared system like on a web server or
[00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:57.640]   You know, um, I cloud and you've got one
[00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:02.280]   Services amazon web services azure azure you've got multiple
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:08.360]   People using the same processor then and one of those people could be rogue and see all and look at the cash
[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:13.000]   As it's loaded for all the other processes that's really the most risky attack
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.800]   Vector but if so if you think about that's really how this happens
[00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:22.680]   But it's scary to think that it could be done in a browser because that means you could go to a website with some malicious
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:26.040]   JavaScript whether it's a malicious site or not this happens all the time
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:31.240]   Injecting an ad fund. Yeah, well, I just saw a really interesting article
[00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:34.840]   Where I think this is on the mediums back channel
[00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:42.280]   Was one of the how no was hacker noon where he says, I'm I'm not saying I did this. Yeah, yo god
[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:48.280]   That was really interesting. He's basically basically. Yo, sorry. You do it. You do it
[00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:57.400]   No, but just basically he's he he initiated a hypothetical scenario under the term sounding is oh, he'd actually done it
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:05.400]   But where you have an open source project and he basically wrote a simple like little javascript tool for adjusting the color of text
[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:14.120]   And it also has a payload that does something malicious and rather than you know writing this as a malicious piece of software and putting in an app store
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:18.680]   He just simply added it to a very malicious code to what would be a very popular?
[00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:27.640]   Course the tool of suites that developers might use to deliver ads for to deliver web pages for and so once people start subscribing and using this
[00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:31.960]   This this code code package. They're essentially unbeknownst to them
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:38.760]   It was helping spread this malignancy on his behalf. So essentially, that's how you could get
[00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:46.040]   a simple javascript exploit in the field to uh to deploy through amazingly
[00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:49.320]   Diverse ray of channels without having the hey, just
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:54.360]   Hey guys, don't there's an app called pokemon harvester don't download this one app
[00:10:54.360 --> 00:11:00.840]   Because it's this code that is being downloaded by ad servers and used in the background of so many sites you might be using
[00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:04.760]   So that's a good example of how you know a really legitimate site
[00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:07.800]   Using node for instance might
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:13.320]   By loading a package that decided to use colored syntax coding
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:18.760]   Yeah, uh, you know third hand load in this little and it doesn't take much
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:23.400]   Malicious javascript that would then take advantage of specter. That shows how fast this was changing
[00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:27.000]   It's like the initially they were like meltdown is bad, but we can mitigate it
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:32.680]   Uh, potentially specter is worse, but it's also much harder to exploit and oh no javascript proof of concept
[00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:38.600]   Yeah, the next day bad news and it's just it's moving so quickly and it's one of the reasons that the mitigations are continuing
[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:45.560]   Uh, because what I think happens initially the first mitigation you do is you say well stop speculative execution or stop
[00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:49.480]   Yeah, allowing one process to see the l one cache of another process
[00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:53.240]   But in every case it has a severe impact on performance
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:59.640]   I think also an xte can say this much better than i but uh, they are they can't fix meltdown and specter because they're
[00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:02.840]   Their chip architectures all they can do is try to prevent known
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:08.360]   Exploits for them, but they can't prevent unknown exploits for them and so now they're stopping the javascript stuff
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:14.360]   But someone could have been something else. So they have to it's like forward forward moving security and protection
[00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:20.840]   Well, I mean ultimately you fix it by uh by changing how processes perform, but you don't want to you don't want to impact performance
[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:28.040]   As the register predicted 5 to 30 apple pointed out that it's fixed for safari which pushed out yesterday on ios
[00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:34.040]   Uh and macos, uh is at worst 1 to 2 percent nothing you'd notice on two of the benchmarks
[00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:40.600]   It was 0 percent on one it was 2.5 percent the worst i've seen is epic games put out a thing on one of their games saying that it was being impacted
[00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:46.760]   For close to 20. Yeah, fortnight. Yeah, it's being you're you're generally talking about super high performance apps
[00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:52.840]   Of most people they can they can benchmark and see a difference, but they probably won't notice a difference
[00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:55.240]   But this is going to be a big big problem for like gaming
[00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:57.640]   Um, uh
[00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:00.520]   Of course this came right before ces right before
[00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:03.560]   Uh, the ceo of intel has the big
[00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:11.000]   Colored stage a huge jumbo screens keynote, uh, and yeah, he decided to address that he decided to slip that into
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.120]   Into ryan krazanich what did he say about the ceo of intel?
[00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:17.000]   He talked about all the money was going to get him from the stock sale. Yeah, he sold
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:23.240]   Huge amount of stock right before after intel new but before intel disclosed he says he didn't know
[00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:29.720]   I don't think I don't I that would be so stupid and so easily prosecuted that I can't imagine he did it on purpose
[00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:35.720]   But anyway, that's right. Well, also at that level you could you have a way to do profit taking that is not going to get you in jail
[00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:38.120]   There's a there's a way to do that
[00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:40.120]   It's a little suspicious that he sold the max
[00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:44.040]   Either way
[00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:44.920]   Sorry
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:46.920]   That's that's hard
[00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:48.920]   Basically he he was a hey
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:52.680]   Suffice say it's a 180 from what intel was saying when this news first came out
[00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:58.760]   That it's essentially acknowledging the the scope of the problem thanking its many partners for helping them to
[00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:04.040]   To address it and promising these that intel will have updates for more than 90
[00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:10.360]   Of systems that could be affected. Excuse me of cp as it could be affected and the rest of them by the end of january
[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:13.080]   Here's bran krazanich at ces
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:20.040]   This is the key name that he gave and this is the two minutes that he devoted to specter melton
[00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:26.440]   Before we start, I want to take a moment to thank the industry for coming together for another purpose
[00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:30.440]   Saving our bus security research findings
[00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:33.320]   reported as meltdown and specter
[00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:42.280]   In the collaboration among so many companies to address this industry-wide issue that we cause several different processor
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:44.680]   Architecture's has been mostly truly remarkable
[00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:49.720]   The security is job number one for intel and our industry
[00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:56.760]   So the primary focus of our decisions and discussions have been to keep our customers data safe
[00:14:56.760 --> 00:15:06.120]   As of now we have not received any information that these exploits have been used to obtain customer data
[00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:11.640]   And we're working tirelessly on these issues to ensure it stays that way
[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:15.960]   You know the greatest thing he's got superimposed over his head
[00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:19.000]   Keeping data safe
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:24.040]   Now i'm not sure that they can tell great again. Yeah, it's very much
[00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:26.840]   you know truth is
[00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:29.080]   Truth is lies and victory is
[00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:34.920]   It's spacecraft. It's you know, don't don't pay no attention what he's saying. We're keeping data safe
[00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:41.160]   The best thing you can do to make sure your data remains safe is to apply any updates
[00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:44.520]   from your operating system vendor
[00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:49.000]   and system manufacturer as soon as they become available
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.680]   for our processors
[00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:55.640]   and products introduced in the past five years
[00:15:55.640 --> 00:16:02.520]   Intel expects to issue updates for more than 90 of them within a week
[00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:05.720]   And they're remaining by the end of january
[00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:12.200]   We believe the performance impact of these updates is highly workload dependent
[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:14.920]   as a result
[00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:21.480]   We expect some workloads may have a larger impact than others. This was the same line they use in the press release
[00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:27.640]   Yep, which is kind of fudge words because of course. Yeah, if there's no workload, it will not impact it
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:31.160]   Uh, it's workload dependent doesn't really say anything
[00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:35.080]   Yeah, also it's I mean despite what I said a moment ago
[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:43.160]   It really if it's a big big problem if the only people that are going to be affected by a speed hit or the people that really depend on speed
[00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:48.040]   That's the more you'll notice day as fast as you checked your email yesterday
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:56.680]   That's that cursor when you when you're when you're screwing around that that curse will be blinking in that empty microsoftward window just as fast as it was
[00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:02.360]   My using working with the industry to minimize the impact
[00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:08.440]   On those workloads over time. So intel amd arm
[00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:16.120]   And the arm manufacturers like qualcom exe no s uh sam song and of course apple will probably do microcode patching
[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:18.040]   and
[00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:22.360]   I'll wait and see what steve says about this, but that modifies the processor's performance that would
[00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:26.200]   Probably take a hit but it'll also be the best way to mitigate this because
[00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:32.920]   When we talked about this last week steve said, you know wouldn't be so hard and probably wouldn't be so hurtful to tell processes
[00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:35.000]   You don't get access to this ring zero
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.680]   Information you don't get access to this. This is system information and just prevent that they should never have had access to that
[00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:44.040]   And that was the implication we got from line us torvalds
[00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:50.520]   Um messages on the linux mailing list. He's the creator of linux and he was very critical of intel
[00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:53.640]   He said how long we have to put up with intels crap
[00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:59.480]   So he blamed intel he felt like intel did not implement speculative execution properly
[00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:03.960]   Uh, but we should again say its other processors are also suffering the same thing. So I
[00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:07.960]   I'm not technical enough to know, but i'm sure steve will explain it to us
[00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:10.600]   Um
[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:14.280]   A story this big it really does take a week to figure out exactly how bad
[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:17.560]   Realistically all these things are what the what the solutions are going to be
[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:21.960]   But i'm glad i'm glad i didn't have to write about it tuesday night because tuesday night
[00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:25.320]   All I was all I was reading from like the papers and the
[00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:32.760]   The technical papers and like technical boards is that that sounds like the worst thing that could possibly happen and that computers are now over
[00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:35.240]   It's this is
[00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:38.280]   I didn't get to play tuesday night because I was just sorting through stuff as it happened
[00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:41.320]   I think the tuesday show kind of said that they don't to get rid of your mac
[00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:42.520]   It's not safe
[00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:43.480]   But uh
[00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:49.400]   They were a lot of apples sent like a lot of places just covered it as an apple story apples slowing down computers again apple hit by a crushing
[00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:52.600]   CPU bug that's terrible. Yeah, um
[00:18:52.600 --> 00:19:00.360]   I gotta say we have an advantage being in the apple ecosystem or one has an advantage being in the apple ecosystem
[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:05.320]   I use everything but microsoft's had a hell of a time fixing this first problem was
[00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:07.880]   some antiviruses
[00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:10.280]   need access to kernel code and
[00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:16.760]   So when the patchers applied to machines running many of the biggest antiviruses including my microsoft's defender
[00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:19.160]   They got a blue screen of death
[00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:21.640]   uh, so then they told
[00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:28.360]   antivirus was to fix this and when you fix it set a registry key so that we know we can apply the patch
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:34.760]   Which that sort of half worked a lot of people fixed it, but then set the registry key
[00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:42.200]   So there are a lot of people who couldn't update their windows today microsoft said we're whole we're halting the update entirely
[00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:45.640]   Because we're getting blue screens on some a m d processors
[00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:47.480]   so
[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:51.560]   The advantage of being a heterogeneous system that we're not targets
[00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:59.720]   You know what you're fixing you control the ecosystem almost entirely certainly on ios apple can you know patch it and patch it effectively
[00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:04.360]   Uh, there as far as I know there've been no problems on macos with these patches either
[00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:12.040]   And no, I mean it was a small blender where apple initially reported that meltdown had been mitigated on high sierra sierra and
[00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:15.800]   On el capitan and then the next day the last two were gone
[00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:20.680]   Yeah, hi so you so you want to be running the latest operating system and you want to be running the latest version
[00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:21.880]   My guess is we'll get though
[00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:26.280]   There must my guess is something went wrong with those patches where they weren't they weren't ready when they thought or they were
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:30.200]   Something different about them and they had to pull them or they had they didn't release them that to update the page
[00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:32.760]   And hopefully we'll get them soon because there are some computers
[00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:38.360]   I just can't run iosierra and there's some environments where you're just you're the your company does not allow you to upgrade for a certain amount of time
[00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:42.120]   And we got supplemental updates if you're already running 10 13 2
[00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:46.680]   You will have gotten a supplemental update yesterday, which I think fixes the safari problem
[00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:51.560]   iOS also got an update which apple eventually said yeah that fixes the safari
[00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:55.480]   Yeah 11 dot 2 dot 2 yeah, so you want to do this security notes like they don't
[00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:59.080]   They said you kick the little security link and it always takes you to the previous security link
[00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:03.800]   I don't know why that's the case, but if you actually typed in the new version you would get the security page
[00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:07.560]   I'll do that that's better. Yeah, because I was trying to read what there was doing
[00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:12.920]   And I understand apple doesn't want to be too forth right on what they're fixing because that's an announcement too bad guys
[00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:15.000]   This is where you should look
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.880]   They were good with this. I mean they credit they they named the bug they used the proper code they credited the researchers who found it
[00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:25.000]   I wired had a phenomenally good story about the history of this bug and sort of like the three or four teams
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.960]   That all found it at the same time because kizer was like
[00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:34.520]   Kaiser was the system where you separate the kernel space from the user space and they were saying they were trying to propose this and people like
[00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:39.800]   Now we don't need that that's dumb. We don't suddenly everyone was interested in it and they go, but it has a performance problem
[00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:42.520]   Yeah
[00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:48.200]   And they're like why are they looking and then suddenly they're like oh, this is why and someone at google's like oh
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:51.080]   I was writing these tests to see about this and oh
[00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:56.680]   And they I think Intel said they were all disclosed within like a month or so of each other one of these different teams
[00:21:56.680 --> 00:22:01.960]   The synchronicity of this is very interesting. I think it was brian Krebs who wrote about it and Krebs and security who
[00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:08.200]   Said it's not unusual now. He he actually invoked liveness and newton who came up with calculus at the same time
[00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:12.840]   Implying that there's just you know, it's kind of an insight. It's in the zeitgeist. I don't think it's that
[00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:18.360]   I think rohamer was the trigger that there was an earlier timing attack that had a similar impact
[00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:22.120]   And I think what happens is security researchers go. Oh, that's an interesting avenue
[00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:26.360]   And they all kind of start seeing well, let's see what else we can do with that
[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:29.320]   So they were using it as an argument that
[00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:36.600]   Governments that find these exploits should disclose that because they don't they can't they can't predict that other people aren't looking for the same exploits
[00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:38.840]   And if they sit on them, then we're all less secure
[00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:44.040]   precisely that's the that's the real the real key on this is
[00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:49.000]   And then the thing that we really wonder about now is
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:57.960]   Well, did this did the three letter agencies know about it and this isn't a bug. It's an ended. Yeah, and it's his 90 95
[00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:00.280]   Yeah
[00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:06.200]   And then if if they knew about it now on the other hand, this is it makes sense in a way
[00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:08.600]   Uh
[00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:13.240]   Because it's going to be most useful in a targeted attack because the information you get is really just kind of this
[00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:15.480]   You don't control what information you're going to get
[00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:19.960]   It is kind of a different attack than an attack that lets somebody for instance get root access to your system
[00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:24.040]   Uh, it is it is an attack that extracts information
[00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:27.560]   from your system and you can't really be sure what it is
[00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:29.880]   Um
[00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:34.360]   That you're going to get it's it's it's hard to figure out how to how to weaponize this
[00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:36.920]   properly because
[00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:42.280]   I was talking to an engineer who was saying that one of the difficulties is that would be very very difficult to keep an eye on that cash
[00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:48.520]   In such a way that you weren't just just by the performance degradation that your malware would be inflicting
[00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:51.640]   Red flags wouldn't be set up, but it's
[00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:56.600]   People who are motivated to do bad things will figure it out
[00:23:57.320 --> 00:24:03.000]   And this is the list from the uh, u.s. Uh, computer emergency response team of
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.240]   CPU hardware vulnerable to side channel attacks
[00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:11.480]   Star dot star. Um, yeah, I could basically say all of them
[00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:14.440]   I mean even in video
[00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:15.480]   Yeah
[00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:20.440]   Yeah effect net app and raspberry pi and technicolor not affected those are the three
[00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:23.160]   Everybody else qualcom
[00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:25.720]   Everybody else affected red hat
[00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:33.720]   Synology everybody else and the real problem is there are some platforms and this is where you're glad you're running an iPhone like android
[00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:37.800]   That the vast majority of devices will never be patched period
[00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:43.080]   So the three letter agencies good news you can continue to use this to attack the bad guys
[00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:45.960]   As as unless they're using android
[00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:47.960]   um
[00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:49.960]   This is this is uh
[00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:55.240]   It's serious. It's difficult to exploit, but it's serious enough because it affects so many
[00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:58.280]   Systems it's so universal
[00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:03.080]   Uh, any one move on anything else you want to say before we wake up call
[00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:05.640]   I mean we survived harp bleed we're surviving meltdown inspector
[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:11.480]   But it's a continual reminder that we built this thing so fast that we didn't really stop and shore up the foundations and that you know
[00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:16.120]   Companies should pay attention to security as they're as they're optimizing for performance. Yep. Yeah, yeah
[00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:19.240]   but the and the only thing i've been telling people is that
[00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:22.520]   You can't it is a big problem
[00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:25.160]   We can't really predict the damage that could be done by this
[00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:31.880]   But it just reminds you that this is why you should make sure that you keep it close on your financial statements every single month
[00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:37.480]   Make sure you check your credit reports make sure that you rotate your passwords regularly. There's just good hygiene
[00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:39.800]   Uh that if you
[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:45.560]   Doesn't matter what happens outside in the real world you can mitigate how badly you can be affected by it
[00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:50.600]   Uh nuke you can't you can't do anything about a nuclear missile coming in arcing towards you
[00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:55.240]   Uh, so that's true, but it also means that well the pressure's off of you. You don't have to worry about it
[00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:57.800]   It's nothing you can do about it. You'll be obliterated before you know, but
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:02.360]   Yeah
[00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:07.880]   Actually you said something that's very interesting. I just want to highlight this and i'm sure steve will talk about it
[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:10.120]   uh
[00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:14.120]   For a long time there's been kind of a general advice just change your passwords a lot in fact
[00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:20.040]   Some companies have policies every three six months change your passwords and the national institute of standards nist
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.320]   retracted that about a year ago saying well, we just kind of the guy who wrote it 30 years ago
[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:26.920]   Just kind of made it up
[00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:32.600]   And in fact there are real reasons not to require password changes tends to make people use less
[00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:39.160]   uh, forgettable passwords less in other words less secure passwords or maybe add a number to their password and wrote and there
[00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:42.120]   It's just maybe not the best policy except now that maybe
[00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:46.520]   Now that we know there are ways to exfiltrate passwords that might be very widespread
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.560]   It is good advice again to periodically change your password. So I think we're going to have to change our
[00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:54.120]   changed recommendation because of this
[00:26:54.120 --> 00:27:00.280]   Yeah, well, it always goes about saying that again don't use one two three four five six
[00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:03.160]   Don't even use one two three four five six seven eight as your password
[00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:07.720]   Uh, there's a reason why they publish a list of here all the passwords that we keep finding online
[00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:11.960]   And they're typically the the the same 20 in the first 50 every single year
[00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:14.440]   Uh, but and yes, you're right
[00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:17.800]   If you if you're trying to impose a password policy on other people
[00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:22.280]   You have to really keep in mind that you have to give you have to create something that is practical
[00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:25.960]   Because people will always find the path of least resistance
[00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:29.960]   They're like water flowing from the strumma mountain to the to the valley
[00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:32.440]   They will not take the long way around they will carve
[00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:38.360]   Rock channels through rocks to make sure that they can have a password that does not stop them from being able to get done
[00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:39.960]   What they need to get done
[00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:43.480]   Uh, but that doesn't mean that you can't implement them in a in a wise way
[00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:49.560]   That makes it work, but you know, but I think that the especially in the world that we're in right now
[00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:53.880]   Uh, one of the most important defenses you have against all kinds of maliciousness
[00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:59.240]   Maliciousness going out there is to make sure that if someone grabbed a password file a month ago
[00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:05.160]   If that's only that's only be good for them for the next two or three days because you're scheduled to change the part the passwords
[00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:09.480]   Of anything that's important basically every four to six weeks. So that's it's
[00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:15.800]   You just like to not have to worry about things and rotating passwords frequently is one of the ways you don't have to worry about things as much
[00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:18.680]   Yeah, I really think it's changed recommendation. The good news is
[00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:25.720]   A password vault certainly last pass, you know, make that easy and that's yeah, maybe my job tonight to go home and uh and do something
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:28.200]   I don't really do that often because I think it's a
[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:33.640]   Unnecessary why I used to think it was a well. I'll use leo's passwords leo use and he's passed. Yeah, we should really use my
[00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:39.560]   It also is interesting then now we're seeing calls for and i'm not sure this is the right idea
[00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:44.760]   Uh, this is uh, jason pearlow writing at zd net y entails x86 must die
[00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:48.920]   Our cloud centric future depends on open source chips
[00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:52.120]   The theory being if chipped architectures were open
[00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:56.280]   People other people could look at them find flaws faster
[00:28:56.280 --> 00:29:01.480]   Not that there wouldn't be flaws, but you'd find harply harply got found fast enough. Yeah, see
[00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:08.440]   I'm not sure I agree with this but uh, I think that's probably what line of stormfalls was was saying is we we need to have open source
[00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:10.680]   chips and
[00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:14.680]   I think there is definitely uh, maybe some drum beat now to get rid of x86
[00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:19.800]   There's just too much math and there's not enough people looking at it all the time. Yeah, and we're so dependent on it
[00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:21.880]   Well, and I mean I don't want to
[00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:29.160]   Create a straw dog here, but it is also the case that there's incentive for companies like intel to make their processors faster
[00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:35.240]   And even if it involves cutting corners and when you do that in secret, you don't know if they've cut corners
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:38.680]   And I don't know if this was a corner cutting. It certainly was a
[00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:44.760]   Massive performance improvement which intel desperately needed in the mid 90s as you remember. Yep
[00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:50.280]   All right. Well again when gamers want 4k video at 120 frames per second
[00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:53.320]   There are not a whole lot of ways to get that done
[00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:58.920]   So making your computer safe has to be second to making sure that no other shooter is going to get the drop on you
[00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:03.720]   Yeah, so with as with everything it's you either there's no such thing as a low fat muffin
[00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:07.480]   They're just gonna they're gonna remove the fat but they're gonna add in something that's just as bad for you
[00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:13.160]   Well, I had this conversation earlier in the week where someone was like what I was explaining that with some of these issues is because we want desktop class
[00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:19.800]   Performance and all these devices we want like main mainframe performance and desktop devices desktop and mobile and what will you sacrifice?
[00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:23.960]   Yeah, we could make chips that are much easier on batteries, but they would be much slower
[00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:26.760]   And will you give up your machine learning and your ar and your
[00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:32.440]   60 frame per second 4k video and your shooter games and your 3d and the answer is no
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:37.640]   But all these things how it's easier for us. We can just say we want everything but to balance those things is non trivial
[00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:42.040]   Let's take a break. There's still a lot to talk about including uh
[00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:45.720]   Our one weekend review of the iMac pro
[00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:52.840]   But first well, I guess it's gonna be mine because I don't think either of you have yours yet mine mine. I should get mine that my review
[00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:54.840]   I'm just waiting so excited
[00:30:54.840 --> 00:31:00.920]   Mac break weekly brought to you by fresh books with a year end and the new year resolutions
[00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:05.320]   I'll tell you what this one of the big resolutions for every
[00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:11.800]   Small business or new business would be to make a start a fresh start with your accounting software keep your books right with
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:16.440]   Fresh books. I know you're saying but leo I thought fresh books was
[00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:21.320]   Invoicing software. Well, it is it's but it turns out if you keep track of
[00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:23.640]   money
[00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:29.560]   Oh, do you money received expenses? You're pretty much doing your books without even thinking about it. And that's what I love about it
[00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:35.240]   Fresh books intuitive dashboard gives you quick access to spending outstanding balances
[00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:41.560]   And something that a lot of people in business. I know I didn't never know till tax time your profit
[00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:44.120]   Are you making a profit today?
[00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:45.960]   What's your total profit?
[00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:49.480]   You get all the accounting reports you need when tax time comes around you'll be very happy
[00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:56.200]   And with fresh books, yes, you can make invoices really easily beautiful invoices that get you paid
[00:31:56.840 --> 00:32:01.240]   Faster because you can now with fresh books accept credit card payment from your clients online
[00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:04.760]   That means you're going to get paid on average twice as fast
[00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:09.560]   And no more chasing clients for payments or waiting in line at the bank accepting credit cards
[00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:12.840]   Is as easy as can be your clients even prefer it
[00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:17.080]   See what it see what invoices now that with air miles
[00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:21.640]   We even get people wanting to pay for advertising with credit cards. It's really interesting
[00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:23.800]   There's a big sea change in the way people pay bills
[00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:29.640]   See what invoices have been sent which ones have been paid most importantly which ones have been viewed no more
[00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:34.760]   I didn't get your invoice. Yes. You did. I saw you read it. You can also see what's out
[00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:39.640]   Outstanding what's overdue and automatically even send little reminders
[00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:42.200]   Makes it much easier to do the job you need to do
[00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:47.160]   And now this is a new feature that what I thought I love fresh books because they're always adding stuff like every week
[00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:52.440]   There's something new you can now create proposals in fresh books rich text content images
[00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:54.920]   customizable sections

[00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:04.120]   It gets you started with the proposal on the process of doing the work billing them
[00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:07.000]   Time and hours expenses. It's all in there
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.640]   Know what you did when you did it

[00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:38.600]   For making mac break weekly possible
[00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:44.120]   So I have no real use for the iMac pro, but I love it
[00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:47.400]   Leo is the best home theater theater you've ever
[00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:53.240]   No, I don't use it as a home theater computer. I use it as my main machine at home on my desktop
[00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:55.880]   um, and I've got
[00:33:55.880 --> 00:34:00.360]   Two cinema displays on left and right. I did have to get dongles because it only it has lots of ports
[00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:05.000]   But not the right ports it doesn't have a display port and it doesn't have thunderbolt to port
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:09.560]   And of course my cinema displays are ones display port once thunderbolt too
[00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:14.040]   So I had to buy the expensive apple dongles. Okay same thing for drives
[00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:19.560]   I must meant I don't have any thunderbolt three drives and actually this is something I learned to my my sadness
[00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:23.000]   I had an a kiddio thunderbolt three rate array
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:26.120]   But it was only windows compatible
[00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:28.920]   apple blocks it
[00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:34.120]   And and I don't I don't know if there's a technical reason to block it because I noted there is a hack
[00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:36.600]   A kernel extension you can use
[00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:39.000]   That will let it work, but I wasn't going to do that
[00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:44.200]   And when I contacted the kiddio, they said we can't fix it in firmware. You need to buy new hardware
[00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:49.240]   So be aware if you have thunderbolt three enclosures and you really want to use them with your iMac pro
[00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:51.640]   Make sure they're Mac compatible
[00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:57.080]   Um, that's too bad, but that's the way it is. There's nothing faster though. Even that I don't think as as fast
[00:34:57.080 --> 00:35:02.040]   As that internal drive we benchmarked it here. Yeah, three and a half gigabytes a second. I mean it's
[00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:08.680]   Unbelievable. Yeah, I took a motion pro project that Anthony nelson created for tech news weekly
[00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:15.320]   Uh, it he does it. He renders it on his macbook pro admittedly. He doesn't have you know the latest in grade
[00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:18.680]   I don't know if he has he might have a 2016 2017
[00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:25.000]   Anyway, he says it takes all night to do and that's minus motion blur. He says I don't even turn on motion blur
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   I could that wouldn't render in weeks
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:31.160]   Uh, I rendered it with motion blur in an hour on the iMac pro
[00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:35.560]   That's the kind of thing that changes your life if you're doing that kind of thing
[00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:37.560]   played
[00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:41.560]   Uh, very popular game this epic game that was slowed down by the way. That's how I know the name fortnite
[00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:44.680]   That's one of those battle royale games 100 players and everyone
[00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:50.280]   Exits, it's really a great game. It's really fun, but I I played it because it uses metal
[00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:53.400]   Uh apples, you know
[00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:56.280]   To the metal
[00:35:56.280 --> 00:36:00.840]   Programming for the gpu and uh, I turned it up everything up all the way
[00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:03.880]   Everything all the way turn it to 11 turn it to 11
[00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:09.480]   It you know as most games do it. It says well, this is what I'm gonna pick for your machine. I turned it even higher
[00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:15.960]   Uh turned off the frame rate gaining. I turned everything up and it didn't barf
[00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:23.160]   It pretty much stuck 60 frames a second. It's you know, it can go faster if I turned it down. I can go faster, but 60s plenty
[00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:25.960]   fluid action looks gorgeous
[00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:30.600]   And best of all I kept other things running in the background
[00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:37.240]   And this is the biggest change in how I use it and I think this is actually a legitimate reason to want an iMac pro
[00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:39.720]   Even if you're not doing you know motion
[00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:44.120]   Blur in motion projects or rendering 8k video
[00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:48.440]   You don't there's so much ram on this. This is I got the rene a rishi model
[00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:55.000]   The 64 maybe 64 gigs of ram 10 processors because it's the fastest single processor clock speed
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:59.400]   Terabyte hard drive because I thought I was be able to use these high speed external drives
[00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:01.400]   I'll have to get some if I'm gonna do that
[00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:02.840]   um
[00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:07.640]   And you just don't close anything. Yep, so you're playing fortnight, but you still got light room
[00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:10.840]   You see everything's running in the background all the time
[00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:19.560]   And I look at the processors. No problem. Nothing's nothing is maxed ever. I have never maxed anything GPU or processor
[00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:25.080]   It's I remember when the first uh when the garbage can came out the trash can came out guy english used to run batman ark
[00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:29.720]   I'm asylum on one of those gpu's and laura kroft whom later on the other gpu and just leave them
[00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:32.840]   Sleeve them going yeah, and you can even more that now. Yeah
[00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:35.480]   You just you feel like there's breeding program
[00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:40.440]   You feel like there's just a lot there's so much headroom that you don't really have to ever think about it
[00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:47.000]   Jason snell was on the new screen savers. We talked a lot about it, uh, and he uses isotope to um, yeah
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   Process audio and he says that's a very slow overnight another overnight program much much much faster in a sine mat pro
[00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:58.120]   So one of the things Jason talked a lot about he got a briefing from apple about is the t2 chip
[00:37:58.120 --> 00:38:01.800]   I know you've written about this, uh as well. Yeah, this is
[00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:04.680]   Not affected by meltdown
[00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:12.040]   By the way, yeah simultaneously more and less than we thought it was it's less in the sense that it is not a dual processor architecture
[00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:15.320]   You're not getting an arm chip and you're not running ios
[00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:18.200]   But it's doing some really interesting things
[00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:22.040]   For instance the the memory on this has no controller
[00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:26.040]   It's just bare chips the controllers in the t2 processor
[00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:30.600]   It's subsumed almost all the controllers on the inside that usually ran on the mac
[00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:34.600]   Uh the imaging controller the disk controller the storage controller the memory controlled all of that
[00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:37.320]   Just went right into the t2 chip to make it efficient and secure
[00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:40.760]   I don't have a face id or touch id but
[00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:43.720]   If I had the right kind of camera, I could do face id
[00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:48.440]   And if I had a fingerprint reader, I could do touch id because that's what does it right the t2 is what does it?
[00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:52.360]   So I I believe that you I don't think you could do touch id because as a security enclave
[00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:55.240]   It does not have the neural net work like it's not an a
[00:38:55.240 --> 00:39:00.360]   Okay, I know so it wouldn't do face id but if apple shipped a magic keyboard with touch id
[00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:07.720]   They can put an a 11 in it. Yeah, the the iMac pro got sort of this awkward phase where apple's moving from touch id to face id
[00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:11.640]   And it does I don't think they're gonna maybe they'll make some but I don't know if they're gonna make much more touch id
[00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:15.880]   And they're not ready yet to do face id wide so this sort of shipped in between otherwise
[00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:20.680]   I think if this had shipped a year earlier, it would have come with a magic keyboard with touch id. Yeah, actually i'm kind of
[00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:26.200]   Apple's always good at making sure you buy into the ecosystem the apple watch unlocks it just fine
[00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:29.560]   And that's really all I really need I have touch id on my mac
[00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:32.920]   Pro like I think you do too and I don't even like I before I reach for it it goes
[00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:36.520]   Like I feel a little and the little there is a lot gives you the taptic feedback
[00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:36.920]   Yeah
[00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:42.680]   And in a way I am using face id to unlock the mac because the the watch is unlocked by the phone
[00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:48.200]   Which is unlocked by face id and because the as long as I keep the watch on it now is authenticated
[00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:51.240]   Using face id it authenticates the mac so it all works
[00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:56.920]   As seamlessly as one would ever want it's a nice to trust chain because as long as you opened your phone
[00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:59.960]   The watch trust you as long as the watch is on your wrist and feel your pulse
[00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:04.200]   You know the computer trust the watch and the computer just opens for you
[00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:08.360]   The t2 is also used for the face time camera. So it's a 1080p camera
[00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:16.360]   But it's it it recognizes faces to the degree that it exposes not for the background not for the highlight but for the face
[00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:19.560]   It has the image signal processor from my forget
[00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:22.920]   I think it's the a the an i of the a 10 inside it
[00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:26.040]   So it does everything that you'd expect the image signal processor and an iphone to do
[00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:30.920]   But on a 1080p camera iced that camera on site or sorry facetime camera on your iMac pro
[00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:37.480]   It's really is cool. You get the i've never gotten a better image autofocus auto white balance auto exposure
[00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:41.400]   It knows faces the t2 also controls the fans
[00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:43.320]   and
[00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:49.000]   I tell you even when where i'm taxing this thing 100% as as hard as I can which was with the motion
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:50.440]   Project
[00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:53.560]   It gets hot you can feel it, but you never hear the fans is very
[00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:58.200]   It also secures the camera and the microphone so that they can't be sort of hacked the way people worry about face
[00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:01.320]   You know cameras being taken over that's all inside the secure enclave now
[00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:04.280]   And it's sort of hardened against any infiltration into it
[00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:10.680]   It does a very I think a very good job with the microphones as well. It's got how many four mics
[00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:17.000]   Yeah, and it's got those big boomin speakers and this yeah, I haven't heard the speakers. I hooked it up immediately to my
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:21.400]   Audio engines, but uh, it sounds good for an iMac like it's not
[00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:25.960]   It's sort of like when the ipad went to ipad pro the iMac went to pro gave it those sort of big booming speakers
[00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:28.920]   You know what I should investigate is what DAC it's using for audio
[00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:37.480]   Because I have external DACs. I have a phiodac. I have some very good external DACs for converting the digital audio to analog for the speakers
[00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:39.960]   But I just plugged my speakers into the headphone jack
[00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:44.040]   Um, I am I'm I would guess apples using a good DAC
[00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:51.880]   I would be shocked if they were their audio team has been really on fire lately because we complained for years that apple the company that invented the ipod
[00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:54.760]   Had crappy speakers on the mac crappy speakers on the iphone
[00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:59.480]   Grabbing speakers and ipad and now the ipad speakers are great the iphone speakers have gotten better and better
[00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:03.080]   And they're even ramping up the mac speakers and i'm glad they're putting that time and attention into it
[00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:05.960]   And the t2 also secures the boot, right?
[00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:07.640]   Yep
[00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:11.640]   So it goes right from the beginning of the boot chain step by step each one secures the other one
[00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:16.840]   So it's sort of like the security chain we just spoke about so from uh, ef efi is it the right way?
[00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:19.160]   Yeah, I think it's called efi. Yeah
[00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:23.080]   Everything from the boot sector all the way up. It just verifies one step after the other on the chain
[00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:28.440]   So if you wanted to install linux or something on it to the metal you'd have to turn this off
[00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:31.560]   But there is a startup security utility that lets you
[00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:39.560]   Control this turn on firmware password protection choose if you want full security no security medium security
[00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:41.880]   disallow booting from external media
[00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:46.120]   So that's nice if you're using an environment with something might come along with a usb drive with
[00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:51.160]   Something bad on it. You can keep it from booting to that all of this is really nice and i and
[00:42:52.520 --> 00:42:56.840]   Jason did confirm what you told me and what we experienced when we turned on the iMac Pro
[00:42:56.840 --> 00:43:01.160]   It starts with file vault enabled because the t2 secures the disk
[00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:06.040]   And then you can add file vault as well so that even if somebody took the whole machine
[00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:08.120]   There's no way they could get into your data
[00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:13.480]   Yeah, it does it all in hardware the t the t2 chip does hardware and krypte krypt live on the data as you're reading and writing it
[00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:15.480]   Which is really cool. It's very
[00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:17.880]   I you know except for the price
[00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:21.560]   It's definitely the computer you want
[00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:28.120]   Um, but I mean there the downside is that they are using expensive like they're using zon w processors and they're using
[00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:30.680]   Ecc ram so they're using expensive
[00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:33.160]   Yeah, yeah
[00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:39.400]   And you probably don't like the whole thing about this is apple plays around at the high end and those technologies filter down
[00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:45.080]   Well, hopefully they filter down to the low end scooter x says that in the teardown the i fix it teardown
[00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:47.080]   Which is definitely worth looking at
[00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:50.520]   They identify the deck as a serous logic
[00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:55.000]   Uh, deck i don't i'm not familiar with dax but any audio
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:00.280]   File will be able to tell us if it's good as the cs 42 l83
[00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:02.600]   audio
[00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:05.400]   That's more and more custom silicon in there. Yeah, look at all this stuff
[00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:07.800]   I you know
[00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:11.480]   It's probably mostly psychological, but I have I have definitely bonded
[00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:16.280]   With the slate gray i'm heck pro when you spend $8,000
[00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:19.480]   Yes, certain incentive to like it
[00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:22.040]   You bought its love, um
[00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:25.320]   Don't let it into your head leo. That's what it wants
[00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:28.680]   Leo i'm space gray
[00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:32.680]   Here's some interesting uh news some exciting news apple, uh is
[00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:36.520]   adding features to serie as they get ready for
[00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:44.200]   the release of the home pod. This is the standalone speaker that was delayed. It was supposed to come out the end of the last year
[00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:48.920]   uh according to apple on track for an early 2018 release
[00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:54.600]   But the new version of beta version of iOS 11 to 5 sports
[00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:58.280]   A new feature in serie. Hey serie. Give me the news
[00:44:58.280 --> 00:45:02.840]   Will pop up one of us select few podcasts
[00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:09.160]   You can switch between fox news npr and cnn. I guess you get to choose it. It's kind of like the flash
[00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:12.360]   briefing on amazon's echo devices
[00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:15.720]   So that's you know, I expect to see more
[00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:19.960]   Uh features, uh if it's going to compete with amazon echo
[00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:26.840]   Um, the default is a daily news recap by the washing and post but you can choose others
[00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:28.840]   I wish you could choose more than just those four
[00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:33.480]   I'm surprised at new york times uh daily briefing on there. I love the daily. That's
[00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:38.840]   Love that that's uh, that's really that's I would even have say that's kind of an important
[00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:41.240]   Uh, newscast now to uh these days
[00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:43.640]   Yeah, listen, but yeah, they don't
[00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:46.920]   If they if they don't really let you have your everyone everyone has
[00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:49.960]   If this is going to be what you get you news from in the morning
[00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:53.400]   Then they got to make sure that they support pretty much everything
[00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:55.800]   if
[00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:59.880]   Maybe not to full bore loony, but just one full
[00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:02.680]   I want my alan's dammit
[00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:03.880]   Uh, they does
[00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:05.320]   I'm looking at the
[00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:09.000]   Images from nine to five mac and I notice on the right under settings
[00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:14.360]   It looks like you could switch on the daily as one of their choices as well as tech memes top news
[00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:16.520]   so, uh
[00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:18.840]   It looks like you can add more which is nice
[00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:23.720]   That's I I use that on my amazon echo all the time. I really like
[00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:27.480]   Having uh kind of you can you say good morning echo. It'll tell you your
[00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:30.760]   The day the the weather forecast
[00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:35.800]   It'll tell you what appointments you have and then it'll give you your in flash briefing and by the way we offer
[00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:40.760]   uh, twitter offers uh content for flash briefings from all of our shows so
[00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:47.320]   Uh, if you do use the amazon flash briefing, make sure you go into the settings and and look up twit because we have some good content
[00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:49.880]   This show
[00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:51.800]   Andy
[00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:53.800]   I I just really hope that
[00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:59.320]   2018 becomes the year of seria. I hope that they make seria as important to
[00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:04.120]   They're messaging as important to their tech lineup as anything else that they're doing right now
[00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:09.080]   Because they're really in danger of getting lapped by by their two competitors here
[00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:11.400]   um google which doesn't
[00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:18.040]   Usually the the huge huge companies like like google don't have a huge presence at ces
[00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:22.600]   Because they tend to use the use their own events to announce and show off really cool things
[00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:31.880]   But they are using ces to show off google assistant and not only to announce partnerships with a whole bunch of new hardware manufacturers to do more
[00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:36.200]   uh, more amazon more amazon echo type
[00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:40.760]   Devices that have built-in screens and can show youtube videos and stuff like that
[00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:44.920]   But also launching an entirely new like marketing site that says here is exit
[00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:47.080]   Here is everything you can do with google assistant right now
[00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:54.280]   Um, and also putting a button in the google assistant app on uh on the google search app that will just give you a rundown of here
[00:47:54.280 --> 00:48:00.120]   If you have no idea what google assistant can do for you here it is topic by topic purpose by purpose
[00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:03.800]   Things you can say things that we'll work with and i not
[00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:06.600]   It's hard to know what the real
[00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:13.480]   Uh, what the real functionality gap is between syri and the competitors i know i do believe it's there and i do believe it's substantial
[00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:14.360]   But
[00:48:14.360 --> 00:48:19.320]   Unless apple really gets on their horse right now and starts saying here are things that syri can do
[00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:25.880]   And no, it's not just that we added a simple read a news podcast feature that's been in all of our competitors for a couple of years now
[00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:30.680]   They really do get the they're i think they're creating the impression that syri is just the
[00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:34.280]   Is just what you get when you have all apple products?
[00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:39.000]   It's not the good stuff you could get if you were not using apple products. Yeah, i mean
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:47.560]   At a real apple can't sit back much longer they're both you're right google is going coming on real strong they said they activated
[00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:52.760]   Uh six million new google assistant devices, uh at the holidays
[00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:57.240]   Which means they're catching up rapidly to echo echo is not sitting still though
[00:48:57.240 --> 00:49:03.800]   One of the other things we see at sees this year is echo everywhere in fact i just ordered this from anchor
[00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:10.600]   This is the roav viva. Yes, uh, which puts echo in your car
[00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:16.200]   In a really interesting way as a cigarette lighter adapter it offers two usb ports, but it also
[00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:22.600]   Has a microphone and an echo and you could pair it to your if your car supports a 2dp
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:26.280]   Bluetooth streaming which almost all modern cars do you pair it to your
[00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:29.480]   Bluetooth streaming and now you've got you've echo enabled your car
[00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:33.800]   These guys are you know these are mature products that are getting
[00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:39.800]   Ubiquitous and apple's just kind of waiting not it's not it's not just that it's not that people
[00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:44.440]   associate these assistance with the google home product or the amazon Alexa like
[00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:52.360]   You know a cylinder product it really is like that time when phones moved from clicky keyboards to multi touch
[00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:57.640]   And there were a couple of companies notably that don't really exist anymore except for a sticker
[00:49:57.640 --> 00:50:04.760]   You can license to put on your on your selfie stick that we're really really late in figuring that out and how important this is
[00:50:04.760 --> 00:50:09.800]   A voice assistant is an app platform. It's a services platform
[00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:14.600]   It is an entirely new mode of computing that can translate to watches to phones to
[00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:19.560]   In car devices to audio devices to kitchen devices to pretty much everything that's out there
[00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:25.880]   And the longer apple takes to really land that point that we want you want to start investing
[00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:31.960]   In siri the more the hardest can be from the catch up. It's not just the idea that
[00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:38.040]   I've spent a few hundred dollars now on google home devices or a few hundred dollars on echo devices
[00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:42.360]   It's that the more you use these things the more you sort of program yourself to save
[00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:45.400]   Before I want magic voice to do something. What do I say?
[00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:48.120]   Is it is it slo mo is it alio?
[00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:52.360]   Is it giermo and it's more and more as I moved into this new place
[00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:57.640]   It's giermo and you really it's remind me again, which one's giermo?
[00:50:57.640 --> 00:51:00.920]   That's the google one
[00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:05.400]   I'm doing I get I'm doing a solid for all of our listeners
[00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:12.200]   Alleo she gear. It's the first initial alleo show giermo and slo mo. Okay. I got it. Okay
[00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:18.440]   There was I think it's not your mo. It's alleo she to be honest with you. That's fine
[00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:20.520]   It's you know, I will say that
[00:51:20.520 --> 00:51:22.200]   Okay, it used to be slo mo
[00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:27.960]   It used to be yeah, exactly. It's uh, it used to be that I had a I had a house with like
[00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:29.640]   Uh much too big house for me
[00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:32.440]   So I had like a big I had a big first four and a big second floor
[00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:35.160]   And so it was like having two cats that fight
[00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:41.560]   So I had I had the the the the amazon devices on the first floor and the google devices on the on the second floor
[00:51:42.040 --> 00:51:49.400]   And now that it's like a smaller space where it's a little bit more compact and actually the first place I've moved into since this
[00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:53.560]   Since I really had an opportunity to choose between one or the other
[00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:56.760]   Really when it comes head to head for me, it becomes google
[00:51:56.760 --> 00:51:59.640]   Uh, it could have been amazon, but it really comes down to google
[00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:04.760]   I'm not going to I can't imagine what apple could ship at this point that would get me to switch
[00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:06.200]   uh
[00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:07.960]   And so I hope that apple is again
[00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:14.360]   I it would have to it would be something that says that not only have they really updated siri to be a powerhouse
[00:52:14.360 --> 00:52:19.160]   But also that they're there they have a whole they have a whole future plan for it
[00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:23.560]   That's more than making my other apple devices more useful
[00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:29.400]   To me it's super interesting because I think there's a lot of there's series still is this problem where like nigh out of ten
[00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:33.000]   I only use siri I try to use google assistant and I hit this brick wall where it says
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:37.000]   You have to enable us to monitor your web and app activity and I just say no and it says well
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:39.160]   You can't use us and we agree to try again next year
[00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:43.320]   Um, but so I mostly use siri but like nine out of nine out of ten times is fine
[00:52:43.320 --> 00:52:50.120]   One time it just acts like I found that one server in the back of the closet that nobody's patched and has no idea how to answer any query
[00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:53.720]   And I think until you get over that that's really hard and these are you really
[00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:59.000]   Taught us that and I didn't realize that the the different surfers on this siri
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:05.880]   Server farm of different capabilities and the effectiveness of siri can very much depend on which server randomly you get
[00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:10.120]   And also the vice I mean there's a whole there's a whole like the different devices can do different things like
[00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:14.840]   Siri and apple tv is one of the most advanced assistants in the world because it can actually do multilingual
[00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:20.440]   It can understand when you're switching languages, but it's only in a few countries and there's you don't know like there's no home kit on the mac
[00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:24.520]   You can't use home kit on your mac was eerie for no reason like just because apple hasn't done it yet
[00:53:24.520 --> 00:53:30.280]   And that's all frustrating if you hit it and these like we saw messaging becoming a an actual operating system
[00:53:30.280 --> 00:53:34.760]   Especially with we chat in china and voice is going to be the operating system of cloud-based
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:41.320]   Computing because it's just the easiest way to interface with abstracted networks in the sky and there's a huge battle for it
[00:53:41.320 --> 00:53:45.960]   Um in microsoft ad cortana and google has assistant and amazon has alexa
[00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:53.240]   I still i'm using siri, but I saw this fascinating study from ben baharen in carolina millenese of creative strategies
[00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:56.520]   They do great work because they have huge sample sizes of real users
[00:53:56.520 --> 00:54:00.520]   And there's a sort of discussion about how embedded in this is apple far behind
[00:54:00.520 --> 00:54:03.560]   I have people made their choices are a lot of people using these
[00:54:03.880 --> 00:54:08.440]   Um, and I had a bunch of different analysts on to talk to and some of them think like this is just open
[00:54:08.440 --> 00:54:13.400]   It's like open season right now. Nothing is settled everything is wide open and others think that people are making choices
[00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:19.320]   But what I loved about their study is like the vast majority of people who have either a google or an amazon product
[00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:21.880]   uh the top three for um
[00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:25.240]   For amazon was set a timer check the weather play a song
[00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:28.680]   Yeah, top three for google where play a song check the weather set a timer
[00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:31.720]   And this is like the only one that even approached 60 percent of people
[00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:35.480]   When you get to anything advanced like even a sports score barely hits 10 percent
[00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:38.680]   Uh add an item to your to-do list is like 5 percent
[00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:44.280]   Yeah, so in some ways it still is really nascent technology for us where it's going to be where the rubber is going to hit the road is
[00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:46.440]   I believe home automation
[00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:50.840]   And uh apple which really had a plan there with home kit
[00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:56.040]   This is where it's going to really come down because it turns out talking to your lights and your
[00:54:56.760 --> 00:55:02.520]   Garage door and your tv is really I think is going to end up being the kind of the thing
[00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:08.040]   That's to me you're right those first three skills a better interface for those but it's a much better interface
[00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:12.760]   And so I feel like that's really where the rubber is going to hit the road and and I think the analysts who say it's not
[00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:16.920]   That's not yet over is probably right. There's a still a
[00:55:16.920 --> 00:55:20.360]   Opportunity for apple with home kit, but they think about this going
[00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:25.960]   We saw at ces for example cola and moan are putting out home kit controlled showers and baths
[00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:32.600]   And amazon Alexa controlled, but these are all still responsive technologies. They're still like, you know, I wake up in the morning and I say
[00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:37.960]   Um syri or or do dad start the shower for me, but we're gonna get to a point
[00:55:37.960 --> 00:55:45.720]   And but maybe like I think google might have the advantage here because despite amazon's wife
[00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:48.520]   But it's like they might you might get up and it'll say hey
[00:55:48.520 --> 00:55:50.680]   I just noticed you got up do you want us to start your shower?
[00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:55.560]   We started your shower for you and when you start rolling the prescience in and the machine learning and starts figuring out
[00:55:55.800 --> 00:55:57.960]   How to do things preemptively to make your life easier
[00:55:57.960 --> 00:56:03.000]   We haven't really seen any of that yet and also mostly these are single tat like do this do that
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:08.040]   Which is not how you it should be like um, we have chains and things, but you still can't get chaining
[00:56:08.040 --> 00:56:10.520]   But but stream of consciousness training chaining
[00:56:10.520 --> 00:56:13.560]   And there's a whole bunch of stuff and also the multi personal assistant
[00:56:13.560 --> 00:56:18.600]   Which google is beginning to unlock but I don't want like if andy and i were roommates and I want to say read my messages
[00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:21.880]   I shouldn't get and these messages. No, so like it and that's advanced voice record
[00:56:21.880 --> 00:56:27.080]   It's just so much that we still have to do a lot google's ahead in those particular realms. I think yeah
[00:56:27.080 --> 00:56:30.200]   Yeah, and i do i don't think the the race is over yet
[00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:35.480]   But it's and this is and this is one of the difficulties that apple has culturally
[00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:38.760]   That sometimes you do really have to talk about here's what we're researching
[00:56:38.760 --> 00:56:40.040]   Here's what we're working on
[00:56:40.040 --> 00:56:46.760]   I don't think they should be as foolish as all the stuff we're seeing is ce s which here is a magical self-driving bus that will serve churros
[00:56:47.160 --> 00:56:52.280]   That you will never see anywhere outside of this this keynote event right here right now
[00:56:52.280 --> 00:56:56.280]   but when google google knows that they really have to
[00:56:56.280 --> 00:57:05.480]   Make sure that their assistant looks like a platform that's worth investing in both as developers and as users and as hardware manufacturers
[00:57:05.480 --> 00:57:12.360]   They they spend a lot of time explaining about changes their improvements that they're making just a simple simply to their voice system
[00:57:13.160 --> 00:57:19.960]   And how they're showing you here is actual human recorded voice here is the synthetic voice we built based on that professional
[00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:24.360]   Voice artist's voice here is how well it does inflections on its own
[00:57:24.360 --> 00:57:27.000]   I was using it just the other day where
[00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:30.360]   There's little inflections where it understands
[00:57:30.360 --> 00:57:37.320]   All the different ways that you said a human being says the word okay, which is to say that I acknowledge that okay
[00:57:37.320 --> 00:57:42.920]   This is this is the end of our vocal transaction. I hope I hope I've pleased you
[00:57:42.920 --> 00:57:46.840]   I will not be talking to you about this in the future or
[00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:52.520]   Okay, meaning that I've heard your request. I mean more information from you on and on and on and on
[00:57:52.520 --> 00:57:56.920]   It's it's stuff like that that really that is the part of the secret sauce that makes all this work
[00:57:56.920 --> 00:57:59.560]   it's just kind of frustrating when
[00:57:59.560 --> 00:58:05.560]   Google is making sure you know that now you can chain commands together and there are ways that you can
[00:58:05.560 --> 00:58:09.160]   Make a command like, you know, put the house to sleep
[00:58:09.160 --> 00:58:12.840]   I'm going to bed right now and make things work and apple
[00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:16.280]   They're willing to let you know that gosh when they have their their own four hundred
[00:58:16.280 --> 00:58:20.040]   Dollar smart speaker that competes with the other four hundred dollar smart speakers
[00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:22.040]   I've been around for the past year and a half
[00:58:22.040 --> 00:58:25.400]   You'll be able to pick music in a much better way
[00:58:25.400 --> 00:58:31.880]   Like okay, that's nice. It's that's a step forward, but that's not that's treating it like a feature and not like a platform
[00:58:31.880 --> 00:58:34.920]   They should make sure that they're treating Siri like a platform
[00:58:35.640 --> 00:58:41.000]   Don't know who they need to send to what the conference to give what kind of keynote, but they're
[00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:43.480]   Lut they're not creating the emotion that they're doing
[00:58:43.480 --> 00:58:48.760]   Yeah, I have to say there was one in marriage slo mo has and that's the apple watch
[00:58:48.760 --> 00:58:53.160]   I was just thinking the one time I use Siri all the time is when I have my watch
[00:58:53.160 --> 00:58:59.960]   Challenges and other stuff get over like i've been married a really good point to that apple like again
[00:58:59.960 --> 00:59:04.520]   I won't use google because I believe that they should be paying I believe my data is valuable enough
[00:59:04.680 --> 00:59:07.080]   That it's not worth them. Just give me free services. They should pay me for it
[00:59:07.080 --> 00:59:08.360]   And that might be a crazy view
[00:59:08.360 --> 00:59:11.480]   But it's mine, but apple like my choice is not to use google
[00:59:11.480 --> 00:59:16.360]   But to use apple but I would like a hybrid where maybe apple does take a lot more of my personal data
[00:59:16.360 --> 00:59:21.480]   But gives me a lot more personal assistance and doesn't store it and doesn't use it for marketing and doesn't use it
[00:59:21.480 --> 00:59:23.480]   For you know to power adsense or anything
[00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:25.160]   But just it takes the data
[00:59:25.160 --> 00:59:29.080]   Collects it does a bunch of stuff on it and then disperses it when it wants to like right now
[00:59:29.080 --> 00:59:30.200]   I feel like I have to choose all or nothing
[00:59:30.200 --> 00:59:34.280]   I have to give everything to google or I have to go with apple who doesn't want to take anything
[00:59:34.600 --> 00:59:37.400]   And I don't sort of get the ideal that I want from either of them
[00:59:37.400 --> 00:59:40.920]   And the challenge on the google side is they seem philosophically insistent that they're
[00:59:40.920 --> 00:59:44.200]   Insistent that they're assistant have no personality that it be computer
[00:59:44.200 --> 00:59:47.000]   And there's a lot of people um carolina was talking about this too
[00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:52.840]   They just feel off put they would much rather speak to an amazon or apple assistant that has a name and feels like a character
[00:59:52.840 --> 00:59:55.080]   Like a like a funny robot
[00:59:55.080 --> 00:59:58.040]   And not something cold like yeah, they called like google
[00:59:58.040 --> 01:00:00.680]   So they all have these false awful things that I wish they'd get passed
[01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:05.240]   I think if if you take the long view it is early days for all of these
[01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:07.960]   They're only slightly useful now
[01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:11.720]   And there's still plenty of opportunity for apple to get in the game
[01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:16.440]   But i put zero on their own hardware and that's always a bit like you when the new version comes out
[01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:18.920]   You will try the new feature so you always have another chance
[01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:21.800]   Right to introduce yourself to people but you've got to take those chances
[01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:23.880]   You've got to take those chances
[01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:27.560]   I'll say this it is the one of the things that kind of put me off initially
[01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:29.320]   uh
[01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:34.360]   Selecting the google assistant as my default home speaker system was that it's
[01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:38.440]   Bum bum bum bum okay giermo
[01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:41.880]   That's four syllables
[01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:44.760]   It's it's it's less personable to say
[01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:49.480]   Okay name of software product by corporation name
[01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:51.960]   uh link to it
[01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:55.080]   however, isn't it interesting that that uh
[01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:57.960]   both shlomo and
[01:00:57.960 --> 01:01:00.920]   Alliosham sorry to regret those choices, but
[01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:03.160]   That uh
[01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:07.880]   But the thing is uh, it's gender non-specific that it is yes
[01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:11.720]   It's a female voice because it's a female voice, but you could very trivially
[01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:17.000]   You don't have to recast the character by saying oh by the way, here's a male voice or here is a here is a
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000]   English
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:25.320]   In english, excuse me a british sounding voice that nonetheless uses american idioms and
[01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:27.240]   american language
[01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:28.680]   it's
[01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:31.800]   I wouldn't say that's a transformative and a hugely positive thing
[01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:36.200]   I do think it's a positive thing that we don't have all of our servants be women
[01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:39.080]   That makes sense
[01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:41.560]   But i slow mo my slo mo's a guy
[01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:46.200]   Yeah in england it defaults to a guy different different geographies tested differently for
[01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:49.640]   I use i use that male schlomo. Alexa doesn't
[01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:52.600]   Allioshia doesn't have a male kind of practice
[01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:55.240]   Uh, no allioshia is always a woman
[01:01:55.240 --> 01:01:58.280]   Alexei
[01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:00.520]   That's all about be brilliant
[01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:05.480]   Actually, that's a really good idea. Yeah, the pixel core has an Alex just not amazon. Yeah. Yeah
[01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:08.280]   Um, let's take a break
[01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:12.520]   Lots more to talk about coming up in just a little bit, but first
[01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:19.640]   A word from texture. It's like so nice to have it on your ipad or your iphone or any tablet or android device
[01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:22.680]   And and have great reading always available
[01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:25.560]   For you. I'm looking at the highlights section right now
[01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:29.800]   Which is the first thing that pops up on texture and that there's some really great curated
[01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:31.240]   uh
[01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:37.000]   Articles stories just for me include things that are unique to me like an insider's guide to the bay area
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.720]   Um new and noteworthy stories
[01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:44.920]   If you like politics, man the best coverage anywhere if you're curious about gossip
[01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:48.040]   Did you know gwyneth paltrow is going to give marriage a second shot?
[01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:57.160]   What and you get what and you get and you get by the way every page that's in the magazines on the new stand plus back issues
[01:02:57.160 --> 01:03:02.280]   Plus bonus features. Oh consumer reports ranking the tastiest pizzas
[01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:09.400]   Now i now i've got to read this and the user interface is great what it's it's really good for
[01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:10.680]   um
[01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:14.760]   photography magazines like national geographic or shutterfly because you can you know
[01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:19.160]   Pictures on an ipad look 10 times better than the printed versions of the pictures
[01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:23.320]   So you can really if you like pixel peeping you can really get it with that pizza look
[01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:30.440]   You can really get into it. I am just a huge fan of texture. Yes, you get consumer reports
[01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:36.760]   The national geographic vanity fair the new yorker. Yes, you get wired in pc magazine all the magazines
[01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:39.320]   Huge huge
[01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:45.080]   Uh, there's always an article, you know, there's i have a go to maybe five or six magazines that i look at every month
[01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:48.040]   Uh, some of them are weekly like the new yorker look at every week
[01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:49.400]   but
[01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:50.280]   then
[01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:57.240]   Because you have 200 magazines you discover new stuff you find more magazines and the things like the cooking magazines like bon appetit
[01:03:57.240 --> 01:03:59.880]   I I wouldn't probably subscribe to them
[01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:05.880]   But the fact that if I need a recipe I can go there see images get great recipes that are tried out by really good chefs
[01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:12.840]   Look at all recipes better homes and gardens. What is that chatellene? I love that clean eating cooking light
[01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:15.880]   Diabetic living eating well
[01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:18.680]   Food and wine
[01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:26.680]   Draft if you're a beer lover food magazine from the food network living. I mean there's plenty of recipes alone
[01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:29.800]   I mean this is wine enthusiast weight watchers
[01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:32.360]   And and it doesn't stop there
[01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:37.800]   There's stuff in my industry like ad age and billboard that I would never I couldn't afford to subscribe to all these magazines
[01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:40.360]   But the fact that I could say check the billboard charts
[01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:44.280]   Just as kind of part of my texture subscription that makes it fantastic

[01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:28.840]   texture.com/twit I ordered I mentioned I ordered this rove
[01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:31.000]   Viva
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:38.040]   Which is puts amazon's echo in your car. I will get have it early february that comes and I will give you for sure review of it
[01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:45.800]   But uh, so many automobiles now are going to have and there are a few places where voice makes sense home automation
[01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:47.640]   In the car
[01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:53.160]   And I have to say I use seria my apple shlomo on my apple watch all the time
[01:05:53.160 --> 01:06:00.680]   So it's clear that a lot of what makes or breaks these voice activated devices is uh the in the environment
[01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:02.760]   Maybe
[01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:07.400]   I want that I want that system to be where I yes available to me whenever I want to use it
[01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:12.360]   And I agree when I even on my android rear watch that's probably one of the most useful things to do
[01:06:12.360 --> 01:06:14.520]   Also, I feel like you feel like dick Tracy
[01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:19.640]   Well, but yeah, you have you really don't that's the problem with watches is the user interface is too small a screen
[01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:22.200]   There's no you good user interface voice is
[01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:25.720]   The best user interface and certain I don't know if I should say this or not
[01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:30.760]   But I was I was driving to another city over the holidays and in the middle of the drive
[01:06:30.760 --> 01:06:34.680]   I got a comment on a story and I was sitting there and I was bringing my mom with me
[01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:37.080]   And as we're driving
[01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:40.280]   I just saw the thing come up and I said, you know, read the message and I got the message
[01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:45.560]   And then I told uh seria to open up the app and my mom can can help me with some of this stuff
[01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:48.600]   But we basically cut and pasted it I kept telling seria to open different apps
[01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:53.000]   We would paste the thing in and actually got it up and weed it out and into the story
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:57.160]   Well, I would try with the city using a series and a tapping assistant
[01:06:57.400 --> 01:07:00.520]   Uh, and I like again, I dictate whole into drafts
[01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:02.760]   I dictate whole article ideas and it's not perfect
[01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:06.440]   But it's enough that I don't forget what I want to say and it's it's not trivial
[01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:09.480]   But it's easy to take that and then turn into a finished product when I get home
[01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:14.040]   Otherwise, I think nine I ten times I'd forget what I wanted to say or not, you know, not be able to work on it
[01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:17.240]   If you have an apple watch and an iOS device
[01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:23.800]   Uh, I got to give you guys a plug you had merlin man on in the creator agile tortoise the creator of drafts on
[01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:29.160]   And this is it's not immediately obvious how you might use this
[01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:32.440]   Just get it and trust me
[01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:36.440]   Because basically I dump everything i'm trying to remember
[01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:38.600]   Into my watch
[01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:41.560]   If somebody asked me to do something if I make an appointment if i'm trying to
[01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:44.520]   Remember a tv show or a book. I just tell my watch
[01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:49.480]   It then ends up in drafts on ios and then I process it at the end of the day
[01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:51.960]   It's time shift for text
[01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:56.040]   It's and it's a really good example of voice and the watch being
[01:07:56.040 --> 01:07:58.840]   I think I I mean
[01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:03.160]   It's it's incredibly useful and I'd almost entirely use it on my watch
[01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:05.720]   At least as the input device
[01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:09.480]   I use it on my phone when i'm driving. I got what that car mount i mentioned last week
[01:08:09.480 --> 01:08:12.520]   I just have it in there and I can just say yo shlomo
[01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:17.000]   And then it just does things for me and some of the times it makes amazingly comedic errors
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.240]   But most of the time people don't even know that i'm using it
[01:08:19.240 --> 01:08:23.240]   I'll tell you if somebody is watching who works with gregorovich or
[01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:26.200]   alayosha
[01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:29.080]   We might as well make it all russian right
[01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:33.960]   Then you should consider the car mount subs you should consider
[01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:41.320]   Adding a drafts like capability to those devices because that's that would to me be incredible
[01:08:41.320 --> 01:08:44.680]   I mean you kind of do it with shlomo where you say remind me too
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:48.840]   But I don't but the point of drafts is it doesn't just do remind it does everything
[01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:54.440]   You later decide where it goes. What do you want is somewhere you just dump snippets of voice
[01:08:54.440 --> 01:09:01.480]   Well, they become texts snippets of voice to text in a in a thing that you can then process later
[01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:03.720]   You know it's like l3 cash for your brain. Yeah
[01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:10.200]   He actually uh, what's his name greg pierce. Yep greg pierce should really uh do an echo
[01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:12.360]   skill
[01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:13.560]   For drafts
[01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:15.480]   I bet he could
[01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:17.160]   That would be a little
[01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:21.960]   I do actually on your recommendation. I have it on my have it on my mac and I have it on my ipad
[01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:28.360]   The only I just wish it were on my phone. I just wish I could get it to work on the voice assistant that I want to use
[01:09:28.360 --> 01:09:35.480]   It's because you're using android. Yeah, you see I miss it on wind. It's it's moving me back into the mac
[01:09:35.480 --> 01:09:38.520]   I miss it on android. I miss it on the window. You need it
[01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:43.400]   What we're gonna get it. You know what? Let's talk to greg. Let's get it on the echo
[01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:47.160]   I'm sure he's listening. Greg you're
[01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:49.720]   Because I because it's I mean it's good enough to do it on my watch
[01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:51.480]   But it would be really nice if I could just say it out loud
[01:09:51.480 --> 01:09:56.120]   Yeah, hey sugar home first. I think I think that would be the smart move
[01:09:56.120 --> 01:09:59.640]   Only because I I use google home before I use
[01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:06.200]   Well, this is by the way one of the reasons echo has an advantage is because the api and the skills
[01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:09.960]   I mean they have 25,000 skills. I mean that that is a huge advantage
[01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:14.600]   For echo it's kind of like a massive app store and I don't know
[01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:16.840]   Google skills
[01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:21.080]   They didn't have all the services that apple and google have built and they have to figure out a way to make an assistant that could
[01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:24.680]   Be useful without having their own messaging service and they're all everything else to build around
[01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:29.720]   So you talked to apple about this. I thought this was really interesting. They're two activist investors
[01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:31.400]   Yeah
[01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:35.880]   At apple there's jad the janice fund which I think everybody knows they're kind of one of the
[01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:42.760]   Noisiest of the activist investors and then there's calsters, which is the california teachers pension fund
[01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:46.200]   And they wrote a letter to apple saying
[01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:52.920]   You better start thinking about smartphone overuse and addiction among kids
[01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:56.680]   Because if you don't address this now it could come back to bite you
[01:10:57.480 --> 01:11:02.040]   I can't I think it's unprecedented for shareholders of a company to tell the company
[01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:05.160]   Your product is dangerous. You got to do something about it
[01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:10.120]   It's both the best and worst thing for apple because apple far and away
[01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:15.320]   I mean microsoft doesn't mention anything you see but apple's been doing parental controls for years. I don't they're very good at it
[01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:20.840]   Yeah, I don't I don't think google has much of anything in terms of this and there's no like shareholder activists about google
[01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:23.960]   It's like immediately when there's a problem. It's apple's problem
[01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:27.960]   Immediately when we want something we want it from apple and I think that's great in terms of mind share
[01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:30.360]   Um, but apple has done a
[01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:35.960]   There's there's some interesting parts of this one is that apple's done a ton of stuff with parental controls with restrictions
[01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:39.160]   And they have since ios 2 and I think macos tiger
[01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:43.560]   They could always be better apple also has configurator and they have classroom for education
[01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:48.840]   Which if you want you can use on your kids or anybody's iphone or ipad
[01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:53.160]   But those are meant to be it solutions and you sort of need to know
[01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:59.960]   It things or like a phrase your spears can manage the heck out of an iphone or anyone who does it can use configurator to do some
[01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:05.320]   Amazing things with an iphone, but those aren't really accessible to parents and we need something that's a little bit
[01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:10.120]   Better or more granular like I think a lot of people just want timeouts for example
[01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:16.200]   Like shut this device down after so long but it has to be much easier to use than enterprise like mobile
[01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:22.200]   Solution and and and actually was megan moroni on ios day earlier who reminded me this apple
[01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:31.000]   Simply with their don't text while driving feature, which they put in ios 11 has is easily the best and the business on this stuff
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.160]   I mean they've really done a good job. I think
[01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:37.400]   but uh totally and I wanted to have the pressure is starting a
[01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:38.920]   a
[01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:44.200]   socially responsible investing fund and sting and his wife are on the board and stuff like that so they have
[01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:47.080]   There's this is kind of promotional for for jana
[01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:48.040]   uh
[01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:52.920]   California state teachers retirement system. I think probably because their teachers has some interest in this
[01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:57.000]   This is the same thing with accessibility like please please make this an industry discussion
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:01.080]   I yes, I can I can't count how many times i've seen accessibility on an apple stage
[01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:05.080]   I don't think i've almost ever seen it on a google stage or other companies
[01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:08.840]   And this is not what about it. This is something that I want as a consumer of all these companies
[01:13:08.840 --> 01:13:11.160]   I want them all held to apple like standards
[01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:15.800]   It is better for all of us if they do that apple gets all the heat because they got the most successful
[01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:20.920]   And good just give give that heat to everybody please. I want them all to be doing this for me
[01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:24.040]   Yeah, apple did say they're gonna make more stuff
[01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:30.360]   Yeah, and google has had a lot of a lot of coverage in uh about accessibility and stuff like that in the reference
[01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:35.880]   but uh, what I it's it does they do but and I absolutely agree that they
[01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:39.080]   This really should be a complaint about all
[01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:42.040]   phones in general all devices in general
[01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:47.000]   And not just about apple and sees it have figured out why they decided to highlight apple in this
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:51.480]   But this is this is going to be a bigger and bigger problem. I mean, I've been recently i've been taking a look at
[01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:53.480]   child
[01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:55.000]   activity trackers
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:59.960]   Like you know the fitness bands that are designed for children and that okay, that's kind of okay
[01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:07.880]   That's nice that you're sort of able to make sure that your kids have have an awareness of how much they're active or not active during the day
[01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:09.880]   But these add
[01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:16.120]   horrifying features to me where it has things like chore tracking and reward tracking so that
[01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:17.400]   as
[01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:23.160]   If they if they make their basically their their parents can monitor what they're doing and uh, they can communicate
[01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:28.440]   between the devices so that they get certain rewards if they do certain chores and
[01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:31.560]   that's uh
[01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:36.360]   For for lazy butts like me that can be a very handy way to you know
[01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:41.160]   To kick me in the butt and say, you know, you are you are going to clean the floors today
[01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:43.880]   You're going to move the first row the way you're going to dry them up. You're going to wet them up
[01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:50.760]   You're going to do all that stuff and because it's on the schedule and I won't let you I won't let you access instagram until you actually get this done
[01:14:50.760 --> 01:14:52.200]   Okay, fine
[01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:55.480]   But when you're talking about giving this to like a seven eight nine year old kid
[01:14:55.480 --> 01:15:01.160]   Where they're being trained that the reason why i'm making my bed in the morning is because I want to many
[01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:07.000]   Mouse to do the little dance and I want to be able to get tokens that can use to play a game on my phone later on
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:11.480]   I really do I want to see some studies into what that does to
[01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:20.120]   This kid as an adult when they are always linking if I do this for a tangible and immediate and clear reward
[01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:24.280]   As opposed to there no the reason why you clean your room regularly is because
[01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:29.000]   If you don't in a month, you will not be able to see the you won't be able to find anything you own
[01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:33.000]   You won't be able to you'll you'll be honored by Phil
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:39.800]   There is no immediate tangible reward to cleaning a room except for having a clean room in an orderly life for someone who has no kids
[01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:44.920]   You're you're right on Andy and I think there are a lot of parents who in fact we didn't do this will not tie
[01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:46.280]   uh
[01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:49.560]   Rewards to chores. That's just your requirement. That's just your job
[01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:54.120]   You just have to do that's part of being in the family because they don't want to create that connection
[01:15:54.120 --> 01:15:56.520]   But the point here is not that apple would do that either
[01:15:56.840 --> 01:16:02.840]   What apple needs to do and what they're calling on apple to do and every company do is to provide the tools parents need to choose
[01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:05.400]   How they do this
[01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:06.200]   Right?
[01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:09.560]   It's about empowering parents not about putting in stuff
[01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:14.440]   Absolutely, I mean that it's it's good that we continue to have conversations about
[01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:20.200]   What happens when you have a human being that is still in development that their their brain is still cooking
[01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:24.200]   They're still writing their their their their uh their operational software
[01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:28.520]   And if they're usual inner if there's a layer of glass between their
[01:16:28.520 --> 01:16:31.320]   Their brains and their perceptions of reality
[01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:35.800]   What effect does that have in 20 years time? It's at least it's worth studying
[01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:40.920]   No, I always defer to Georgia on stuff like this because she's way smarter than me, but uh, she has kids
[01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:45.480]   She has kids and she's she's got a degree in education and she's a full-time therapist, but
[01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:50.520]   The the interesting thing with this is that apple can only offer technological solutions to this
[01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:54.840]   And when you talk about the effects of screen time on children even on adults, but on children too
[01:16:54.840 --> 01:16:58.840]   Uh, it has to be a balance there has to be parenting apple can't make a cyber babysitter
[01:16:58.840 --> 01:17:04.280]   nor should they make a cyber babysitter for you the most powerful way to prevent your kids having screen time is to prevent them
[01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:09.160]   From having screen time and this is not new. This is don't put the computer in their room put it in the living room
[01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:12.920]   This is don't give them cause and access to a phone because you can put a time out on it
[01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:15.160]   But if they don't have the phone they can't be using the phone
[01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:21.640]   So I think there it's it's a larger societal question about the roles and responsibilities of parenting and the children that we're raising
[01:17:21.640 --> 01:17:26.840]   And how technology and what the technology companies can do to help with it, but there's still ultimately parenting issues
[01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:33.080]   Jimi iovine leaving apple in august, uh, exactly
[01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:37.880]   Exactly when uh his stocks vest
[01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:41.480]   Supposedly reportedly reportedly
[01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:48.840]   Uh, remember of course that iovine and dr. Dray sold beats to apple for 3.2 billion dollars, uh, four years ago and
[01:17:48.840 --> 01:17:53.320]   You'll spend more time with his money. Yeah, but you know, he's also 64
[01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:55.560]   I mean, it's not inappropriate for him to retire
[01:17:55.560 --> 01:18:00.600]   Well, and he rolled out apple music and now apple's getting into uh entertainment that is beyond just music
[01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:05.960]   So he might have been there and done what he needed to do and they're done that apple. Yes speaking of that apple's really expanding
[01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:10.840]   Uh, they ordered a documentary from the producer of rock of ages
[01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:16.760]   They're uh, they gave an order to a series order to a show about extraordinary homes
[01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:22.200]   They're developing a video series with the creator of cereal
[01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:25.640]   Uh based on the novel are you sleeping?
[01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:34.040]   And they've picked this is all this is all this week and they picked up reese weather spoons thriller, uh, starring octavia spencer
[01:18:34.040 --> 01:18:40.760]   Clearly apple is spreading its billion dollars around and I bet you it's going to be more
[01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:45.000]   Than a billion dollars by the time they're done. They realize if they're going to compete with the eight billion that netflix is spinning
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.960]   Although netflix has done too much maybe
[01:18:47.960 --> 01:18:54.360]   It's it's it's so much original stuff on netflix. You don't even know they have different problems like netflix is their product
[01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:59.000]   And they have to always have enough content that you want to maintain your netflix and they're losing movies because it's got to be
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:05.320]   Right. So yeah, and they and but they it's like uh hbo wants you to sign up for game of throwing but netflix wants you to be there for bright and for
[01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:08.360]   Stranger things it always has to be something where apple again
[01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:14.040]   This is a vehicle to make more money off of i for now to make more money off of iphones by creating a ritual overall ecosystem
[01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:18.360]   They just have to have enough and i don't know if they keep calling it apple music when it starts having all this video content
[01:19:18.360 --> 01:19:22.040]   But they have to have enough that when you buy an iphone you're like, well look at all this extra stuff
[01:19:22.040 --> 01:19:24.120]   I get with it and that's a much smaller
[01:19:24.120 --> 01:19:31.880]   Entertainment space to solve for yeah, it's it's once the it's it's easy to make fun of them at this stage to because they're
[01:19:31.880 --> 01:19:34.600]   They're starting to raise so many years late, but
[01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:39.400]   The best time to start any great idea is three four years ago and they have to start some time
[01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:43.080]   uh, and look at look at what amazon prime the amazon prime
[01:19:43.080 --> 01:19:45.640]   Service has done where
[01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:51.720]   I still i still associate with free two-day shipping but the list of things i get for free simply by having this account
[01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:54.760]   uh, is kind of staggering and once they when they
[01:19:54.760 --> 01:19:56.440]   uh
[01:19:56.440 --> 01:20:02.280]   Sometimes a really great series can be a very valuable loss leader so to speak i
[01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:08.840]   The marvelous mrs. Maisel got me making sure that the amazon video app is on every single device i had
[01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:11.800]   It was golden clothes and jeff basil
[01:20:11.800 --> 01:20:14.040]   In the alatino
[01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:16.360]   And i loved amy shriman paladino's top hat
[01:20:16.360 --> 01:20:18.680]   Yeah
[01:20:18.680 --> 01:20:21.080]   And just like uh just like the crown
[01:20:21.080 --> 01:20:24.120]   Like if there if there's a system yep
[01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:30.120]   Oh god and and it reminds you how valuable that subscription is and if that if you're on given that
[01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:34.600]   Given that every single music service has pretty much the same collection of albums even when they have
[01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:39.240]   Have exclusives they don't have those exclusives forever all you have to do is
[01:20:39.240 --> 01:20:45.960]   Maybe it's going to be all you have to do is extend the free period from 30 days to 60 to 90 days
[01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:49.560]   And then make sure that every 60 to 90 days
[01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:53.800]   You have some sort of original content that is
[01:20:53.800 --> 01:21:00.120]   Everybody is talking about that sweep in the golden glows but not only that but on twitter everybody and on instagram
[01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:06.520]   Everybody that is on facebook everybody that's in your social circle is asking you have you started with watching the marvelous mrs
[01:21:06.520 --> 01:21:07.720]   Maisel yet
[01:21:07.720 --> 01:21:11.320]   No, okay watch the first episode no no watch episode four
[01:21:11.320 --> 01:21:13.720]   And then get back to me and then
[01:21:13.720 --> 01:21:19.960]   I've finished it and it is very very good deserved and she is uh really great bresnahan
[01:21:19.960 --> 01:21:25.480]   Deserve to your golden globe too. She's just 26 years old. We're gonna see a lot more of her. She's a superstar
[01:21:25.480 --> 01:21:28.760]   Uh ces is going on. Oh who knew
[01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:32.920]   Yep, we're not there team there. We're not there apple doesn't have a
[01:21:32.920 --> 01:21:39.800]   Booth there but boy apple has a presence there a lot of home kit support coming out bellkin has announced its wemo line
[01:21:39.800 --> 01:21:45.720]   Uh, well, finally starting a january 14th. There'll be a wemo bridge for 40 dollars
[01:21:45.720 --> 01:21:53.720]   Um, and uh that that'll allow you to control with home kit. We must switch insight light switch dim many dimmer and motion
[01:21:53.720 --> 01:21:56.600]   and so
[01:21:56.760 --> 01:22:00.520]   That's good news if you're all in on uh on home kit and syri
[01:22:00.520 --> 01:22:07.000]   Let's see what i'm so much okay stuff in the last week. Lio nano leaf made a 12 sided apple home kit remote
[01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.080]   That looks like a 12 sided die
[01:22:09.080 --> 01:22:17.160]   Uh, if that's if that's not if that's not like rubberized and make sure that you can actually use it in gaming
[01:22:17.160 --> 01:22:20.280]   They're just idiots. I think that they there should be a class action suit
[01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:25.080]   That is like that is an attractive nuisance if they do as you play dnd your lights and everything changed
[01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:30.440]   Well, it really does tempt you to say well, I've got this programmed with 12 different scenes
[01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:32.440]   Let's see what we get today
[01:22:32.440 --> 01:22:39.800]   Uh apple watch users can control select world pool washers dryers in ovens early this year
[01:22:39.800 --> 01:22:43.720]   Not sure why you'd want to set your wash
[01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:44.760]   What am I?
[01:22:44.760 --> 01:22:48.760]   No, one of my worst ces memories was two years ago when I walked into showstoppers
[01:22:48.760 --> 01:22:54.680]   And there was this pr woman there and she was just like make it stop make it stop and the person's looking at her
[01:22:54.680 --> 01:22:58.600]   She goes this effin android dishwasher was texting me all night. I could not
[01:22:58.600 --> 01:23:09.320]   It's not about controlling stuff. It really is about communication
[01:23:09.320 --> 01:23:16.280]   Like the only reason why I have like the bluetooth app on my suv devices just to know just to know it has has the device come up to temp
[01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:23.560]   Right yet, and then just to know and also has it turned off has the oven turn is the is the oven up to temperature when when cooking
[01:23:24.120 --> 01:23:30.040]   Peats and stuff like that. So that's cool stuff and this is home automation is one of those few categories
[01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:35.000]   We're almost nobody is interested in creating something that is that is
[01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:39.240]   Exclusive to one platform because they know that things are really in flux right now
[01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:41.800]   There's huge competition and so there is
[01:23:41.800 --> 01:23:44.440]   Unless there is a deep
[01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:48.840]   Deeply disturbing technical reason why you can't make something work with home kit
[01:23:48.840 --> 01:23:53.080]   They're going to make sure that it works with every single platform that's conductive use of it
[01:23:53.800 --> 01:23:56.280]   I did talk to a developer though who makes a
[01:23:56.280 --> 01:24:04.280]   Device would be very appropriate for home kit who said it's very it's so much easier for us to implement amazon's echo support
[01:24:04.280 --> 01:24:06.840]   Uh, we're working on home kit, but it's not
[01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:09.880]   Any security previously from
[01:24:09.880 --> 01:24:16.200]   Apple's gonna do away with the mfi chip, but I think they're still going to maintain the end end encryption port. Yeah
[01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:18.920]   uh net atmo
[01:24:19.400 --> 01:24:24.040]   Is adding home kit to it's a welcome indoor camera by the end of march
[01:24:24.040 --> 01:24:30.040]   Uh, I mean, I really of course you want all iot devices to support home kit
[01:24:30.040 --> 01:24:34.440]   But again, it requires some investment both in time and money for the company
[01:24:34.440 --> 01:24:39.720]   My thing now is I bought a ton of home kit stuff for the place i'm moving into and a lot of them have their own subscription services
[01:24:39.720 --> 01:24:43.240]   Well, they'll store all your data for you and i'm like nope nope nope nope nope
[01:24:43.240 --> 01:24:48.520]   And I wish I had alternatives like I wish I could just store like I don't need logic tech or I don't need nest to store video for me
[01:24:48.520 --> 01:24:53.720]   Just let me point it at my home server and they like no no web dev api for you and it really adds up
[01:24:53.720 --> 01:25:00.840]   It really adds up. It's not but I also I don't want my video of my home being stored anywhere on the internet. Thank you
[01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:07.160]   That's that's all right. I got fortunately after cleaning out like my old house and all the closets and all the garage boxes
[01:25:07.160 --> 01:25:13.160]   I came across like all the avios like ethernet webcams that I like put away like three or four or five years ago
[01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:18.360]   Not knowing that when I when I set up the new when I the next time I move i'm going to enjoy
[01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:27.240]   Just just like when he says all I want is something that connects to my network that allows me to look out the window to see if the ups truck is pulling up the street
[01:25:27.240 --> 01:25:33.800]   I don't need I don't need motion tracking. I don't want you to I don't have to have to sign into an account to make that happen
[01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:39.000]   I just want to hold up my phone and realize that no I can stay in bed for another eight minutes
[01:25:39.720 --> 01:25:45.000]   Father robert bao is there the digital jessuit is it ceso is dik d bar tollo scott wilkinson
[01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:48.200]   and
[01:25:48.200 --> 01:25:53.320]   Who else we have a number of people down there and we will have reports throughout the week tech news weekly will have
[01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:59.240]   Reports and of course father robert bao is going back from vegas on saturday and co-hosting the screen savers with me
[01:25:59.240 --> 01:26:03.000]   So we will have more drives away than electric supercar
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:09.000]   We decided i just i you know we used to go down there when you do a big booth and stuff
[01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:14.120]   Not only was it horrifically expensive, but at this point it's the show is so over covered
[01:26:14.120 --> 01:26:16.680]   How many people did you send down there?
[01:26:16.680 --> 01:26:23.320]   Uh, we sent we actually cut down hugely for the same reasons you mentioned we sent two from android central two from windows central
[01:26:23.320 --> 01:26:29.240]   Michael fissure mow mr. Mobile and then assistant went and uh, my boss kevin went because he had to manage the whole thing
[01:26:29.240 --> 01:26:31.320]   I think some maybe eight people yeah, i know baiter
[01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:37.400]   Yeah, i mean we sent twice as many down spend half a million dollars on equipment and storage and hotels and food
[01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:40.920]   And gadgets got its own trailer the verge of his own trailer
[01:26:40.920 --> 01:26:44.680]   It is trailers for their trailers now. Yeah, there's more than amply covered
[01:26:44.680 --> 01:26:50.600]   So i feel like we can do we send a few people down, but we can do is as well as we need to just by sitting here and looking
[01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:56.920]   Every year it's a lot of the same like every year it was 3d tv's and every year it was 4k tv's and then every year it was drones
[01:26:56.920 --> 01:27:04.120]   I'm very interested in scott wokenson before he left on saturday said i can't tell you because i'm in barcode
[01:27:04.120 --> 01:27:07.080]   But there is a new tv technology which will be shown at ces
[01:27:07.720 --> 01:27:11.400]   Uh, then we'll talk about it saturday on the tech guy shawt. I don't know what that is
[01:27:11.400 --> 01:27:16.440]   But i know i got jealous because i have that lg olet tv in the new l lg olet tv is colorier
[01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:19.480]   It has more color because higher color depth or something
[01:27:19.480 --> 01:27:22.280]   So i know i'm missing the color that i didn't know i was missing
[01:27:22.280 --> 01:27:30.040]   I every time i sit down and watch my now almost two years old lg b i guess it's a b 16
[01:27:30.040 --> 01:27:35.240]   I don't know it's it from 2016 i have the seven c yeah, six c i have six b six i have
[01:27:35.800 --> 01:27:40.360]   I think god i bought it it is just gorgeous and now there's so much content
[01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:42.840]   I was watching a chance in amazon
[01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:47.880]   Uh show last night in 4k hdr just looks great
[01:27:47.880 --> 01:27:54.200]   I went to itons leo and i pressed the button and it said you've got the hdr version of die hard and harry potter
[01:27:54.200 --> 01:27:57.000]   And the fifth element and my christmas was just done
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:00.920]   I knew what i was doing and i have it in the dark end room with a surround system
[01:28:00.920 --> 01:28:06.280]   We only sit about eight feet from the screen so it pretty much fills your vision and it's it's a better experience
[01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:11.240]   When the movies do are yeah amazing in fact now that blader on our 2049 is out
[01:28:11.240 --> 01:28:14.680]   I'm going to give it a second chance because i saw it in the movie theater in 3d
[01:28:14.680 --> 01:28:20.280]   It was dim dark and i couldn't i didn't like it, but i know everybody else loved it
[01:28:20.280 --> 01:28:24.440]   So i want to watch it again i was like i'll hold me i love the beginning didn't didn't lend the ending for me
[01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:26.600]   Yeah, i love it
[01:28:26.600 --> 01:28:32.040]   I like i like the whole thing but i'll i'll i'll i'll give you two with like an opportunity to advise me now
[01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:36.920]   It's time for me to buy a new tv because the old one is 10 years old now
[01:28:36.920 --> 01:28:38.920]   It still works
[01:28:38.920 --> 01:28:41.880]   But you know the it has fluorescent backlighting and now you get
[01:28:41.880 --> 01:28:47.800]   In dark scenes like in blade runner there's like sort of an instagram effect happening at the edges of the screen
[01:28:47.800 --> 01:28:55.800]   And i'm going back to my usual tv buying algorithm, which is i want to buy all it has to be is like have 4k and hdr
[01:28:56.440 --> 01:29:01.880]   And cost no not under $500 but not more than a thousand dollars
[01:29:01.880 --> 01:29:07.480]   So i'm probably going to be getting like a tcl like a six it costs like 600 or 700 bucks
[01:29:07.480 --> 01:29:09.480]   I don't know why i was i was like
[01:29:09.480 --> 01:29:13.560]   Maybe between 50 and 60
[01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:19.960]   I think that's 55 55 is about g olet isn't i think that 55 inch old that has come down
[01:29:19.960 --> 01:29:24.440]   Yeah, you get last year's model when the new one comes out and save
[01:29:25.240 --> 01:29:30.680]   And uh, the pan i mean it's really i was just running circles and they support Dolby vision
[01:29:30.680 --> 01:29:33.960]   Which a lot of other tv's don't which is just but in your budget
[01:29:33.960 --> 01:29:37.880]   Remember and this is something people forget everything has to be upgraded
[01:29:37.880 --> 01:29:43.560]   You need a new av receiver that supports 4k. You need a roku a chrome cast and apple tv
[01:29:43.560 --> 01:29:48.680]   Everything has to support 4k or you just there's no point. Well i did i did future proof
[01:29:48.680 --> 01:29:53.640]   I got when I bought my av receiver. I bought the cheapest one. They'll support 4k and all the uh,
[01:29:54.120 --> 01:29:58.600]   and all the uh, the the content content perfection standards of that
[01:29:58.600 --> 01:30:01.800]   my tv boxes the
[01:30:01.800 --> 01:30:06.360]   Nvidia shield which are perfect works very good for the hdr
[01:30:06.360 --> 01:30:09.080]   It's just i'm always it's every time that i
[01:30:09.080 --> 01:30:13.640]   From from time to time a company will send me like a two or three thousand dollar tv
[01:30:13.640 --> 01:30:18.280]   In you know a box the size of a mattress and it's nice
[01:30:18.280 --> 01:30:23.400]   But I don't it never blows me away that this is I can I can say
[01:30:23.960 --> 01:30:29.800]   When I put it side by side with uh with a normal budget sort of tv said
[01:30:29.800 --> 01:30:37.160]   I can definitely see the improvement but it's not like the difference between like sd and hd where it's like I never want to go back again
[01:30:37.160 --> 01:30:39.560]   So it's always hard to press you
[01:30:39.560 --> 01:30:42.600]   Oh, no hdr
[01:30:42.600 --> 01:30:47.480]   hdr absolutely no i've had a couple of hdr sets in the office for a couple of years and that's like
[01:30:47.480 --> 01:30:50.280]   It's it's almost I love it because it's almost like
[01:30:50.760 --> 01:30:55.000]   Uh, it's a it's a people pleasing feature. It's like the the reason why
[01:30:55.000 --> 01:31:00.920]   You can buy an $800 tv that looks as good as a $4,000 tv might have two years ago
[01:31:00.920 --> 01:31:06.040]   Just the ability to say let's make sure that there are actual blacks here. Let's make sure there's detail in the whites
[01:31:06.040 --> 01:31:11.640]   Uh, that's just like though. It's even more important than 4k. I think this is you will absolutely notice it if it's your
[01:31:11.640 --> 01:31:15.960]   Oh, I agree 100 percent. It'd be nice to get all led, but that's what really puts you out of the price range
[01:31:15.960 --> 01:31:20.440]   The b6 that I have the 2016 55 inch lj is $1,500
[01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000]   But I noticed that sony selling
[01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:31.080]   A 2016 4k hdr 55 inch for 848 bucks. This is a very nice one. It's just lcd. It's not
[01:31:31.080 --> 01:31:37.480]   Oh, led if you can afford o led it's worth it, but uh, but you know, there's this is
[01:31:37.480 --> 01:31:41.320]   That you'd be very micro led ships in volume. Ha ha if it
[01:31:41.320 --> 01:31:43.480]   If it
[01:31:43.480 --> 01:31:46.920]   Trust trust me if if I were to steal a tv out of someone else's house
[01:31:47.320 --> 01:31:52.680]   I would definitely be going for the o led it's just it's it's hard for me to see the different as good as the difference is to say
[01:31:52.680 --> 01:31:55.160]   Yes, but what can I do for a thousand dollars?
[01:31:55.160 --> 01:32:00.680]   Here's like the better speakers that I can get and here's all the movies that I could buy and you know here and here's uh,
[01:32:00.680 --> 01:32:06.200]   I'm actually I'm actually thinking one of the one of the silly things I'm gonna I'm gonna buy this year is maybe a turntable
[01:32:06.200 --> 01:32:14.040]   Because I still can't get I can't get the the movie soundtrack to the musical 1776 anywhere
[01:32:14.680 --> 01:32:16.680]   They've got the broadway cd which is
[01:32:16.680 --> 01:32:23.240]   Some different cast members as the different songs and so maybe this would be the most expensive single album
[01:32:23.240 --> 01:32:29.560]   I've ever bought my life to buy a record player just so I can get 1776, but it will be a fun adventure
[01:32:29.560 --> 01:32:31.880]   That's that's what that's why I mean about getting value for money
[01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:33.720]   I don't think I will get value for the extra thousand bucks
[01:32:33.720 --> 01:32:39.160]   I've spent for o led as much as I would get by spending two or three hundred dollars for another component
[01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:43.000]   That would be kind of fun to have it's true that micro led. I don't know when that'll be out
[01:32:43.080 --> 01:32:49.400]   But that could be the big thing. That's the technology scott was talking about. I'm guessing he didn't tell us
[01:32:49.400 --> 01:32:53.080]   I'll see like a $25,000 one first and then we'll all look it and go. Ah
[01:32:53.080 --> 01:32:57.080]   That's the idea though is it's direct view. They're basically doing what o led does
[01:32:57.080 --> 01:33:02.520]   But they're doing it with with leds and they're using gallium nitride instead of the organic
[01:33:02.520 --> 01:33:07.400]   Stuff in the um in the which means it'll last longer
[01:33:07.400 --> 01:33:12.600]   But you know you you hear about these things. It doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be in the store
[01:33:13.400 --> 01:33:16.920]   Yeah, no, that's that's 25,000 then all led to 25,000
[01:33:16.920 --> 01:33:21.480]   Just so by the time you're ready for a new tv. Maybe you'll get a micro led to led
[01:33:21.480 --> 01:33:27.880]   That's always the most fun part of ces year after year after year the who who wants to win the crown as the best
[01:33:27.880 --> 01:33:34.360]   Stupid tv out there where this gets out because because like sam sum will have now we have the the
[01:33:34.360 --> 01:33:37.400]   273 inch
[01:33:37.400 --> 01:33:42.120]   12k display and actually this has like uh this has actually like servo
[01:33:42.440 --> 01:33:45.720]   Servo controlled pixels to make it not just 3d with classes
[01:33:45.720 --> 01:33:50.520]   But it will make sure that like the the cars will actually like stick out and crawl and create shadows
[01:33:50.520 --> 01:33:55.000]   They're natural to the lighting and you know that they're people that have that kind of a money
[01:33:55.000 --> 01:34:00.920]   And they will but they buy a new tv every eight months or they they hire people to replace their tv's every eight months
[01:34:00.920 --> 01:34:08.520]   But they only have to ever make the one because it's never going to be on the market for anywhere actually interestingly enough in 2014 apple
[01:34:09.320 --> 01:34:13.880]   Bought a company called luxvue that does micro led
[01:34:13.880 --> 01:34:17.080]   The rumors that apple watch will be the first one to adopt
[01:34:17.080 --> 01:34:23.880]   Yeah, so you might see micro led displays from apple at some point they've had this for three years
[01:34:23.880 --> 01:34:26.280]   um
[01:34:26.280 --> 01:34:28.280]   But we don't know why
[01:34:28.280 --> 01:34:31.480]   Let's take a break. That's our ces update
[01:34:31.480 --> 01:34:37.000]   And i'm sure there'll be much more coming up our back of the book the picks of the week
[01:34:37.480 --> 01:34:42.440]   But first i got a pick for you and it's on my watch or a keychain. It's on everything i've got
[01:34:42.440 --> 01:34:48.040]   Uh, it's on my bike. It's in my luggage. It's called the tracker and it's the best way
[01:34:48.040 --> 01:34:52.600]   To make sure you can find the stuff you own but you can't find
[01:34:52.600 --> 01:34:57.880]   Don't spend hours every day searching for your keys or your remote controls
[01:34:57.880 --> 01:35:02.040]   Get the tracker. This is the new tracker pixels about the size of a dime really lightweight
[01:35:02.040 --> 01:35:03.480]   It's the smallest lightest
[01:35:03.480 --> 01:35:05.480]   Bluetooth tracking device on the market today
[01:35:06.040 --> 01:35:10.440]   But like all the tracker's replaceable batteries mean it goes and goes and goes
[01:35:10.440 --> 01:35:16.040]   You put it on whatever you need to keep track of your keys your wallet. It's small enough to fit in your wallet
[01:35:16.040 --> 01:35:18.600]   your remote control of course
[01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:23.400]   And uh, it has powerful led lights is great for remote because a lot of times the remote
[01:35:23.400 --> 01:35:25.720]   You can't find it because it slipped down behind the cushions
[01:35:25.720 --> 01:35:29.640]   Well, the lights make it easy to find it also has a very loud alarm now
[01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:33.800]   The alarm is useful for a couple of reasons one is two-way separation alerts
[01:35:34.200 --> 01:35:37.960]   So you put the tracker app on your phone. That's how you find your tracker to stuff
[01:35:37.960 --> 01:35:41.880]   But also if you leave your tracker stuff behind your phone can howl at you
[01:35:41.880 --> 01:35:47.400]   If so it basically is like find my iphone for your keys or whatever you've attached your tracker to
[01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:50.280]   I love that idea vice versa too
[01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:52.680]   If you can't find your phone you press the button in the tracker
[01:35:52.680 --> 01:35:55.720]   You don't have to go to the computer and fire up find my i-f
[01:35:55.720 --> 01:35:59.960]   I just press the button in the tracker the phone even if it's silenced will make loud noises
[01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.880]   And the crowd locate network is something unique
[01:36:03.880 --> 01:36:09.960]   Five million trackers out there means that everywhere in the world there are people running the tracker app and when
[01:36:09.960 --> 01:36:13.400]   They see your purse or your keys
[01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:20.440]   Or your luggage when they walk by with the app running on their phone the the app without you know, just automatically
[01:36:20.440 --> 01:36:23.400]   Says I saw them they're right here
[01:36:23.400 --> 01:36:25.320]   It's awesome
[01:36:25.320 --> 01:36:27.640]   th e t r a c k r

[01:37:01.640 --> 01:37:06.120]   slash macbreak and I personally thank tracker
[01:37:06.120 --> 01:37:09.640]   More than once helping me find my stuff
[01:37:09.640 --> 01:37:15.080]   My favorite story I told it earlier today is when I lost my keys in my scottie vest shirt
[01:37:15.080 --> 01:37:17.400]   Oh no
[01:37:17.400 --> 01:37:20.760]   Because it's got so many pockets and I couldn't find my keys
[01:37:20.760 --> 01:37:23.800]   And I thought I left them somewhere and I was looking all over them
[01:37:23.800 --> 01:37:27.240]   I went to the bar I thought I left them at and then I realized oh wait a minute
[01:37:27.240 --> 01:37:28.520]   I have the tracker on them
[01:37:28.520 --> 01:37:31.400]   I pressed I opened the phone press the trapper tracker button
[01:37:31.400 --> 01:37:34.520]   And my shirt starts making like oh I've had them all along
[01:37:34.520 --> 01:37:40.920]   All right time for your picks of the week let's start with Andy and I go Andy
[01:37:40.920 --> 01:37:46.040]   Uh one of my favorite things I've put onto my mac in quite a long time
[01:37:46.040 --> 01:37:51.000]   Uh flexy but they're the makers of Fantasticell came out with a contact manager
[01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:51.560]   Excuse me
[01:37:51.560 --> 01:37:53.240]   Contact utility called card hop
[01:37:53.240 --> 01:37:53.800]   Love it
[01:37:53.800 --> 01:37:54.600]   That
[01:37:54.600 --> 01:37:57.320]   Oh my goodness, it's everything it's you can
[01:37:57.320 --> 01:37:59.960]   And this this is true of this
[01:37:59.960 --> 01:38:03.240]   What I'm about to say is true of mac os is true of windows true of everything
[01:38:03.240 --> 01:38:07.640]   You can always tell the stuff that nobody at the company wants to work on and the
[01:38:07.640 --> 01:38:12.200]   Contact manager at any operating system. Nobody thinks that's a cool thing to work on
[01:38:12.200 --> 01:38:13.720]   So that's why it looks like
[01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:14.200]   20
[01:38:14.200 --> 01:38:20.520]   2004 2005 card hop is a menu lit that will essentially make the make your mac os
[01:38:20.600 --> 01:38:24.840]   Contact's database as useful as a phone app. You just type in
[01:38:24.840 --> 01:38:29.240]   The part a partial name. It will immediately populate here is the here is the contact
[01:38:29.240 --> 01:38:31.000]   You're looking for what do you want to do with it?
[01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.720]   Just by clicking I want to send a message. I want to send an email
[01:38:33.720 --> 01:38:35.960]   I want to call this person. I want to edit this sort of thing
[01:38:35.960 --> 01:38:39.640]   It doesn't it doesn't matter how you put that information into the database
[01:38:39.640 --> 01:38:45.640]   It will surface it for you. So it's not as though you forgot to put you forgot to put the company name where it should have been
[01:38:45.640 --> 01:38:49.560]   Uh, it's good for organizing. It's good for exporting. I just
[01:38:50.360 --> 01:38:54.600]   It's not it's not a complicated app. It's just a simple drop down from your menu bar
[01:38:54.600 --> 01:39:00.280]   But it works exactly you the way you would hope a context database would work. I got to say that
[01:39:00.280 --> 01:39:08.520]   I've so I had written off the bill the mac os built in context app so long ago that now I just go into my mail client
[01:39:08.520 --> 01:39:14.040]   And look for an email that that person has sent me that will probably have a phone number attached to the end of it
[01:39:14.040 --> 01:39:17.160]   Because it's that's that kind of search works a lot better for me
[01:39:17.160 --> 01:39:19.800]   but card hop is
[01:39:20.200 --> 01:39:23.400]   Quickly corrected that behavior. It's 20 bucks a stock sheet
[01:39:23.400 --> 01:39:30.040]   But oh my goodness you will totally is if you go directly to flexibets.com you can download a free like 21 day trial
[01:39:30.040 --> 01:39:34.120]   But you will probably as I did spend the 20 bucks
[01:39:34.120 --> 01:39:39.400]   Very very quickly and then forget about any amount of money you spend for it's really superb
[01:39:39.400 --> 01:39:46.920]   I use it and fantastic health too together on my mac and either and by the way we're talking about drafts
[01:39:47.640 --> 01:39:55.560]   Work so great because I could just send stuff and all of the flexibets stuff has kind of natural language and interprets
[01:39:55.560 --> 01:40:02.680]   And yeah, exactly such. It's just killer. I can't I can't believe that even in this day and age
[01:40:02.680 --> 01:40:08.440]   I'm thinking I wish the context and stuff like that worked though as well as it did in my newton message pad in the late 90s
[01:40:08.440 --> 01:40:13.960]   Like why why can't I just type and anti-nocco 1313 makkenberg lane
[01:40:14.840 --> 01:40:23.320]   Tulsa, Oklahoma 617 4441414 like okay, you know what there's enough information here that I bet you can figure out that that
[01:40:23.320 --> 01:40:25.960]   Bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum
[01:40:25.960 --> 01:40:30.680]   That's probably a phone number that looks like an address doesn't it that looks like a first name in the last name
[01:40:30.680 --> 01:40:34.520]   Why should I even have to tab between fields to tell it where things should go?
[01:40:34.520 --> 01:40:41.320]   And the way that you can simply add just cut and paste things from a web page or wherever or an email into card hop and boom
[01:40:41.320 --> 01:40:48.120]   You've got a contact. Oh my goodness. Why are we waiting so long for this to happen? Apple just never buy it buy it buy it buy it
[01:40:48.120 --> 01:40:50.200]   Bite make it rain
[01:40:50.200 --> 01:40:53.960]   Fly them in first class get Michael and fly them in fun higher. Yeah, exactly
[01:40:53.960 --> 01:40:58.680]   I want my favorite thing about an iPhone card hop. I really I'm sure they're working
[01:40:58.680 --> 01:41:03.080]   Yeah, I keep asking but my favorite thing about it is that humans aren't great at context switching
[01:41:03.080 --> 01:41:04.680]   So if I say I want to contact Andy
[01:41:04.680 --> 01:41:08.680]   I like I have to go and find the app and then I forget what I want to do because then I got to find Andy in the app
[01:41:08.680 --> 01:41:11.480]   And with this is just like I type Andy and then I can make him phone
[01:41:11.480 --> 01:41:16.760]   I can send an email like it's like it's person first and it's it's the way my brain works and it's just so much faster
[01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:19.960]   I'm using something called full contact on iOS right now
[01:41:19.960 --> 01:41:23.480]   But I would replace it with card hop as soon as I as soon as I can I mean you
[01:41:23.480 --> 01:41:27.240]   It apples contact and calendar are bare minimum
[01:41:27.240 --> 01:41:31.400]   They work you could tell the stuff that Steve Jobs is just isn't used instead of Steve Jobs
[01:41:31.400 --> 01:41:36.680]   It's what we used to call a third-party opportunity. Yes, I agree. They're not bad
[01:41:36.680 --> 01:41:39.320]   This is that nice about creating a third-party opportunity
[01:41:39.320 --> 01:41:43.560]   You can more already apple like they sure lock enough apps you can more you already them right back
[01:41:43.560 --> 01:41:45.800]   Renee your pick of the week
[01:41:45.800 --> 01:41:48.440]   My pick of the week. So this this is just for fun. This is for lol's
[01:41:48.440 --> 01:41:51.560]   This is from CES and as far as I know it's not quite available yet
[01:41:51.560 --> 01:41:57.160]   But I saw it and I just I thought it would be fun to share and that is colder announced a bunch of uh, I don't know
[01:41:57.160 --> 01:42:00.120]   I pronounce it color color. It's called color. It's called color connect
[01:42:00.120 --> 01:42:03.240]   So they make all these bathrooms. I want the toilet
[01:42:03.960 --> 01:42:09.320]   Oh, yeah, so seriously, there's a mirror that you can have different lighting settings if you want to do different makeup effects
[01:42:09.320 --> 01:42:13.160]   There's a bath and you could say schlomo or alexi whatever
[01:42:13.160 --> 01:42:19.480]   Um bath oil gray hot and then it'll just bubble or sorry bubbles. Oh gray hot and it'll just do it for you
[01:42:19.480 --> 01:42:24.440]   The toilet will flush for you. It'll warm for you. The shower will place music for you
[01:42:24.440 --> 01:42:29.960]   It it does it'll have like the per-anil control like like you can mesh it with your lighting and your music
[01:42:30.200 --> 01:42:33.000]   So you walk into the shower and it's like boom boom boom boom boom
[01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:37.560]   Uns on lasers as you're going and I know like these are early days
[01:42:37.560 --> 01:42:42.840]   It's not star trek yet, but you can go to the faucet and say eight ounces of you know 30 degree water
[01:42:42.840 --> 01:42:44.920]   I know it does in celsius and fahrenheit like
[01:42:44.920 --> 01:42:49.480]   1973 degree water and it was just for the exact amount for you
[01:42:49.480 --> 01:42:51.800]   Yeah, and again, like these are the first generations
[01:42:51.800 --> 01:42:55.400]   They probably don't have the longevity that will eventually have with these products
[01:42:55.400 --> 01:42:57.800]   Um, but just that we have this stuff now
[01:42:58.360 --> 01:43:01.000]   Yeah, yeah, mommy potty warm hot don't have to touch it
[01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:06.040]   Uh, hey, hey device, uh flush toilet seat down wall
[01:43:06.040 --> 01:43:12.920]   So wash my buttocks you could actually work out in your shower with all this nonsense
[01:43:12.920 --> 01:43:16.200]   It's just this is the future leo and it's coming soon
[01:43:16.200 --> 01:43:19.880]   I already saw the future ever been in airport bathroom where none of the
[01:43:19.880 --> 01:43:26.600]   Hand activated devices work. You can't turn on a faucet. You can't get soap. You can't get towels
[01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.720]   Nothing works the internet is down. You can't shower
[01:43:29.720 --> 01:43:33.560]   I've seen the future and it's got some problems
[01:43:33.560 --> 01:43:37.880]   I think all this stuff is manual though too. So you can go full on galactica if you want to
[01:43:37.880 --> 01:43:40.840]   But it'd be nice like in the morning you wake up and you say shower
[01:43:40.840 --> 01:43:45.320]   You know shower 20 degrees or whatever again, whatever it is in fahrenheit 23 countries that use it
[01:43:45.320 --> 01:43:47.160]   I can't I can't understand anymore leo
[01:43:47.160 --> 01:43:51.320]   But uh, but it would be nice when this stuff begins preempt like it knows that when you wake up
[01:43:51.320 --> 01:43:54.760]   And as soon as it detects your phone lifting it knows you're awake
[01:43:54.760 --> 01:43:56.760]   You're gonna want to shower and it turns it on for you
[01:43:56.760 --> 01:43:58.920]   And it turns the lights on and starts brewing the coffee
[01:43:58.920 --> 01:44:04.920]   And it just starts helping like the predictive execution stuff that we're getting it would just we're getting one step closer to that
[01:44:04.920 --> 01:44:09.080]   I can see this happening. I can and I wouldn't mind it
[01:44:09.080 --> 01:44:11.720]   The connected pooper as long as it works
[01:44:11.720 --> 01:44:16.280]   Because I also can see a vision where the batteries are down and everything
[01:44:16.280 --> 01:44:21.720]   You gotta go on there. I can't I just I've just I've just got great advice for apple
[01:44:21.800 --> 01:44:24.600]   Okay, we we talked about how syree seems to have fallen behind
[01:44:24.600 --> 01:44:29.960]   With here is how they they reclaim all of that and then take a lead that no one can match them
[01:44:29.960 --> 01:44:32.760]   Stephen friday is a big fan of apple things
[01:44:32.760 --> 01:44:36.760]   You have steven friday in his jeeps voice for all this whole automation stuff
[01:44:36.760 --> 01:44:40.120]   So you're a bathmulter is at the appropriate temperature
[01:44:40.120 --> 01:44:42.920]   Oh, he's Jarvis. Even friday is Jarvis
[01:44:42.920 --> 01:44:46.760]   You've you've seen the steven friday alarm clock, right?
[01:44:46.760 --> 01:44:49.000]   Yes, I have I own the steven friday
[01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000]   Do you I'm so jealous
