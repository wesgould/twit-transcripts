[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.760]   And we have the six colors guy here. Did you bring your graphs?
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.160]   I always have my charts and graphs with me.
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.360]   You have charts and a pointer?
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.440]   No, it's all on my iPad now. It's all digital charts and graphs.
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:47.200]   Nell is here. I loved your state of Apple article. You did the report card.
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.600]   Oh, they're the report card.
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:48.640]   Yeah, the report card.
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.320]   And that was, I presume, followed up by, have you done your graphs for the Apple?
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.800]   Yes, I did that too. Yeah, of course. You've got to do those.
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.160]   Is that all later for you?
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.840]   Oh, no, I've got it all scripted. I just put in the numbers and run an Apple script
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.080]   in it all or a shortcut if I'm on iOS and it just outputs all of them. See, there they are.
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.880]   Yeah.
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.480]   Highly. I think that's your report card.
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.800]   Oh, yeah, that's true. That's the report card.
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.720]   I got a template. I can chart anything.
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.640]   Please don't chart me. Please don't chart me.
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.000]   That's Annie and that goes in short.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.640]   I'm short. Annie, of course, with WGBH Boston,
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.280]   Boston Public Radio and at nyco.com, H and A T K O dot com.
[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.880]   Soon to be, are you moving? Are you moving soon to be elsewhere?
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.560]   Did you say you were setting up another site, Andrew?
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.320]   Yes, I did say that.
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.240]   That's not even that.
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.080]   Okay. I haven't, I haven't announced anything yet because I'm still building stuff and still
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.360]   I don't want another fire festival situation in my hands.
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:47.040]   You can buy tickets now, the entire Instagram community is turning green,
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.520]   waiting for Andy's new website.
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.440]   And you'll be able to buy things on the site using Andy bucks and most people are
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.880]   putting at least $2,000 into their Andy bucks account so that they'll have the funds ready
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.720]   when we make things available for sale.
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.760]   We were talking about the dueling fire festival documentaries, one on Netflix and one on Amazon
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.520]   Prime and that was, yeah, that was one of the things they did try to quickly raise money.
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.600]   Put some money in the wallet, please.
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.040]   Electronic wallet of happy fund bucks.
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.200]   You'll be only able to spend at fire festival.
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.680]   And ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Alex Lindsey from the Pixel Corp.
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.600]   Man, this is an embarrassment of riches today.
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.320]   Renee has the day off and so we replaced him with Jason and Alex.
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.400]   Andy, you're outnumbered.
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.280]   Well, I'll guess that's true.
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.000]   But see, I have that sort of distance from the campus.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   That's necessary for rational thought.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.720]   Very clever.
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:46.480]   If you were in LA right now, you would see these, you know, the Grammys are Sunday.
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:54.480]   You'd see these Memoji billboards going up featuring Grammy nominees all over Los Angeles.
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.160]   There's a Casey Musgraves.
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.760]   That's an interesting way to both promote the Grammys and Memojis.
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:09.440]   Apple, I presume, went to the artists to get permission to do these.
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:10.880]   It's kind of cool.
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.160]   One of them is upside down.
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.120]   I don't know who that is.
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.120]   If I want to buy one, they finished it.
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.160]   We're like, oh, no.
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.360]   It does kind of demonstrate that the Memojis look nothing like the person.
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.520]   It's kind of the anime version of the person.
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.480]   Kind of.
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.040]   Kind of.
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.920]   It's their, well, also the Memoji version of me didn't have to shave a half hour ago.
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.160]   So that's not the thought it's handy.
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:32.800]   Do you use it?
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.160]   We were talking about this in iOS today.
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.240]   Do you use anybody use Memojis still?
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.760]   No, I don't.
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:38.800]   It was funny.
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.080]   I was thinking about this the other week.
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.360]   I think Megan also was tweeting about it today or yesterday.
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.200]   And I noticed that it was because of the sound.
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.640]   I just want to go turn the sound off.
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.960]   Like if I, when I was doing my kids, I just want to do expressions.
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.840]   She said that when you're smiling and you're not saying anything,
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.280]   you still get mouth sounds.
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.160]   We get liz now and you hear that whatever's going on in the train or whatever.
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.160]   But you just want to do something funny and send it.
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.600]   You just don't want to say anything.
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:00.080]   Right.
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.040]   About 90% of the time.
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.680]   Stiff, you tongue out.
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.840]   And literally one little button and I would use it all the time.
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.120]   ASMR emoji.
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.640]   ASMR.
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:10.160]   But that's the thing that bothers me.
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:15.680]   So you can, if you pose for an image, you can actually drag it out like a sticker.
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:16.880]   And that works.
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.160]   But I want to do the expression.
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.840]   Yeah, you want to do the animation without sound.
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.240]   Like a wing or some kind of funny expression.
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.600]   But then I means I have to embed audio into it, which I don't want to do.
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.080]   And I feel like that, I think Apple will fix that.
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.320]   Yeah.
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:28.960]   Probably.
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.160]   I don't think I'm the only one.
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.640]   So this, maybe this is going to get you going because there are three new
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:38.960]   and emoji characters in the beta that came out today, the 12.2 public beta.
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.800]   There's the shark with his soulless eyes.
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.080]   And emoji shark.
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.320]   I'm kind of surprised that Apple hasn't timed
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.240]   and emojis with movie releases.
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.480]   You know, with Pixar releases or a wish.
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:53.520]   Especially the opportunity.
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:54.720]   There's such an opportunity to have.
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.880]   No, well, because they sure don't want to
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.840]   fix our character like saying naughty things.
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.600]   Oh, maybe not Pixar.
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.280]   But I do think that there would be.
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:06.800]   There's got to be some.
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.240]   A Gilbert's got free emoji.
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.040]   That'd be OK.
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:14.320]   I'm surprised that this is one of those features that's linked to iOS updates.
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:15.120]   Right?
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.760]   Like I'm constantly surprised at what they choose.
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:22.000]   Like, you know, we can't add new and emoji without doing an entire iOS update.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.360]   And I can't decide whether that's just a decision that they made that they have to
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:30.000]   live with or whether it goes in the same bin as emoji updates.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.360]   As like reasons people actually will update their phone.
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.800]   They're not going to update the phone for their security update necessarily.
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.160]   But they might do it to, you know, because of the FOMO of some new
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.920]   and emoji or new emoji.
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.400]   And maybe there's a whole bunch of people that we don't know
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.720]   that are using an emojis every day all day.
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:47.920]   And we just are missing out.
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:48.960]   We might be just too old.
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.200]   There will be an out.
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:54.000]   And in addition to the shark, there will be an owl giraffe.
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.320]   And the one I'm most excited about the warthog.
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:00.560]   I just, I just, I just, I will jump right back onto an emojis when I get a
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:01.440]   for five seconds.
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:05.600]   No, no, no, I'm going to, I'll use it all day when I get a honey badger.
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:06.800]   Honey badger.
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.160]   I would, I would have you really excited.
[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.880]   Oh, we get all these messages from Alex saying honey badger don't care.
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:14.240]   Yeah, honey badgers are so 2018.
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:15.680]   Alex, I don't care.
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:16.160]   I don't care.
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.480]   So here's what else is in 12.2.
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:19.760]   Do you use the beta Jason?
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:20.320]   Anybody use?
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:23.680]   Uh, not of these interim betas because I'm always worried they're going to trash my phone.
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:24.080]   Me too.
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:25.760]   In the summer, summer of betas.
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:26.240]   Yes.
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:27.360]   I used to do the public beta.
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.320]   I think on the last phone I did, but I just decided on what's ability.
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.440]   I don't, I don't, it's not worth it to mean no ahead of time.
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:37.280]   Unless there's like a really major feature, which they very rarely roll out in these interim
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:37.680]   updates.
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.200]   Apple news in Canada.
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:42.720]   Almost everybody is working on iOS 13 at this point in Apple.
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:43.120]   Right.
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:44.960]   So this is the end of this.
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:48.880]   New screen mirroring icon and control center, new full screen Apple TV remote control center
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:49.280]   interface.
[00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:52.960]   New speakers and TVs and home app settings, more detailed Apple wallet.
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:53.520]   Yes.
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:57.680]   Actually, the most interesting thing I think in there is this idea that just they made these
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:01.920]   announcements that they're going to do airplay support and home kit support in a bunch of TVs.
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:02.240]   Right.
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:07.760]   This beta enables TV control in control center.
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:08.320]   And the whole app you've got.
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:12.320]   So you can turn on the TV and change the volume of the TV and do all sorts of television
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.480]   set things that you previously couldn't do.
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:14.880]   That's good.
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:19.440]   Because I keep forgetting I don't have to use my funky little Apple TV remote.
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.280]   I can use the one on the, you can use your watch.
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:21.840]   You can use your watch.
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:22.720]   Or even the watch.
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:23.120]   Yeah.
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:23.520]   You can.
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:28.080]   And presumably, in addition to the phones that have been announced, people who do like plugins
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:33.440]   for home bridge, which is that great piece of software that makes anything a home kit device,
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:39.600]   I would imagine that they will jump on this for other smart TVs and try to bridge the gap
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:43.680]   so that you could do like on and off input control, volume control, stuff like that,
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:46.160]   directly over home kit.
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:51.680]   New privacy setting in Safari, you can turn off motion and orientation data.
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.680]   We learned this.
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:54.960]   That's really interesting.
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:56.960]   There are companies using this information.
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:59.680]   It will break some apps if you turn it off.
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:05.040]   I don't know if it's off by default, but it is a setting in iOS settings in Safari.
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:06.400]   Yeah.
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:07.440]   It's really interesting.
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:11.520]   There's also, there's in addition to like a website tracking, there's also paper from
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:17.920]   researchers at MIT demonstrating that it is possible to get a good guess as to what
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:20.800]   someone's on lock code is based on gyroscope data.
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:21.920]   Wow.
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:22.640]   Maybe that's it.
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:23.360]   So, wow.
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:29.280]   It's an example of the holistic approach to security that Apple has,
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:32.000]   where I'm sure that they're aware of the real possibilities,
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.160]   but they're also like there is no legitimate reason for most websites that are not involved
[00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:38.400]   in AR to have access to that data.
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.160]   So we're just going to block it by default.
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.880]   That kind of makes sense because that's why they didn't in Safari,
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:49.920]   because you could, if you're malicious in Safari, pop up what looked like maybe the unlock code screen
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:52.160]   and then watch the motion data.
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:55.440]   And if you were sophisticated enough, I guess figure out what your unlock code was.
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:58.080]   So, or at least how many digits.
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:00.800]   Whereas an app, if you downloaded the app, it's less of an issue.
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.840]   I wonder though, if they'll, is that it?
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:08.400]   That's not currently a permissions in the apps, motions and orientation data.
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:11.680]   I don't think they just want to have control so that you, if you're a developer,
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:15.600]   you're going through the Apple rules and engagement as opposed to just anybody.
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:15.760]   Yeah.
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:16.640]   Anybody able to do it.
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:20.800]   Safari will also warn now about websites that don't support HTTPS.
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:25.360]   This has been coming for a while on the desktop, of course, and that's a big,
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:28.160]   big deal in terms of security.
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:29.120]   Yeah.
[00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:34.480]   That's the address bar is another big point of vulnerability.
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:40.320]   Google, for instance, is rolling out changes so that if someone types in like
[00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:45.840]   Amazon instead of Amazon's, you know, it's not going to take you to someone who bought that
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:48.640]   address thinking that, oh, someone's going to be able to,
[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:50.560]   someone's going to mistakenly type in this URL.
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.400]   Maybe we can get their login credentials.
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:56.880]   And so there's a lot of changes across a couple of different companies.
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:01.840]   They're trying to make the address bar a little bit more robust as a point of attack.
[00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:05.840]   When will this come out?
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:08.800]   If they're doing public, it's a couple of weeks later or a month later or.
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:14.320]   Anywhere from as short as a week, I've seen, but mostly about a month.
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:14.640]   Okay.
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:20.560]   And I presume iOS 13 is slated for the fall with release of new files.
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:23.840]   Yeah, I would imagine that they're starting to do their turnover now where they're going to start
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:24.400]   moving ahead.
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:27.440]   I've heard a couple of people talking, somebody was talking about how there aren't,
[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:32.640]   there haven't been any updates to shortcuts lately, which is an Apple app that's in the store.
[00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:37.040]   And that's, you just get the feeling that engineers are turning their attention to working on.
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:42.160]   Because if you think about it, June is when they need to have a shippable public beta of iOS 13.
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.200]   So this is about the time when they all start switching over.
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:49.040]   And they might do bug fixes on the old version, but they're really all about the new versions
[00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:51.680]   that we're not going to see for six months, five months now.
[00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:59.440]   Kind of a surprise that one of the things that Apple is allowing in iOS 12.2 is AT&T's
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:01.840]   5G designation.
[00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:06.240]   Now, I've seen the headline saying Apple approves of it.
[00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:07.440]   That doesn't mean they approve of it.
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:09.760]   They just mean they're not, they're not blocking it.
[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:16.240]   I'm not surprised at all because I remember very distinctly getting 4G on my iPhone back in the day
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:22.320]   when it's when it wasn't an LTE iPhone because I happened to have near my house one of their
[00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:24.480]   upgraded 3G towers.
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:28.800]   And it said 4G and still occasionally I see that when I am not in an LTE area.
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:35.520]   It says 4G and I laugh and laugh because that's AT&T's enhanced 3G that they called 4G.
[00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:39.600]   And I don't know whether Apple's policy is just to kind of go along with whatever their carrier
[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:43.040]   are providing and this is carrier branding so they need to do it.
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:49.520]   But it's not new because they did the same AT&T gimmick the last time AT&T decided to
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:51.840]   jump the gun and claim to be a G ahead.
[00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:57.920]   So just to be clear, I saw the one headline that said Apple's endorsing it.
[00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:01.280]   It's not that they're not, they're endorsing it, they're just not prohibiting it.
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:02.800]   But I wouldn't expect them to prohibit it.
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:05.920]   The carriers are allowed to designate whatever they want.
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:07.040]   I presume up there.
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:11.120]   I mean, maybe they could say no, although I don't know the details of their contract,
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:13.600]   whether they negotiated that in or not.
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:19.600]   But instead they did the work in iOS to enable that little 5G, whatever thing.
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.920]   It's ironic because no iPhone supports 5G.
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:24.800]   Like no phone in existence currently supports 5G.
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:26.320]   That's how AT&T gets you.
[00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:28.000]   Like no, no, we do.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:28.640]   We totally do.
[00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:29.440]   We added a G.
[00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:30.000]   It's right here.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:30.560]   What do you mean?
[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:31.440]   You see what I'm talking about.
[00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:35.040]   It's a Nigel Tuffnell approach to speed upgrade.
[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:39.600]   So you know how like most phones are 4G, a week ago, 1G more.
[00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:46.160]   According to ours, Technica AT&T's 5GE stands for Evolution.
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:49.040]   But it's really 4G LTE.
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:53.920]   Advanced LTE features, but they've been in the LTE spec for years,
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:58.080]   like 256K QAM, by 4MIMO.
[00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:02.800]   It's literally what they did with 3G, where there was the most advanced 3G at the time,
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:06.400]   which was much faster than sort of your generic 3G.
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:10.240]   And they decided to brand that 4G, even though it wasn't 4G.
[00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:16.000]   What I'd like to know is with someone who has this 5GE is testing it,
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.840]   like does it actually have better speeds?
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:22.800]   Because it actually may be two or three times faster than the current LTE.
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:27.040]   And it's an AT&T's best interest to make sure that it's faster.
[00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:28.480]   Well, here's a it's not enabling it.
[00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:29.120]   It's already there.
[00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:30.320]   It's already as fast as it is.
[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:31.280]   It just doesn't say it.
[00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:32.880]   It doesn't update the size of it.
[00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:33.520]   It's just not really able to.
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:35.920]   AT&T is the laggard here.
[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:39.680]   Verizon T-Mobile and Sprint have all supported these standards for some time.
[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:41.680]   So they just don't label it 5G.
[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:42.160]   Yes, exactly.
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:44.240]   See, but AT&T said, we're going to go through all the trouble of putting this in.
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:45.600]   We might as well get something for it.
[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:50.720]   AT&T says, well, 5G Evolution is our first step on the road to 5G.
[00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:51.280]   Oh, boy.
[00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:54.960]   Which is, you know, that road, by the way, is going to be a really long road.
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:56.160]   That's right.
[00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.880]   I mean, that road to 5G is like a decade away.
[00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:02.720]   AT&T says, it's a real 5G network.
[00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:05.120]   We'll be available nationwide in early 2020.
[00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:06.320]   So it's a year off.
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:08.880]   In Bination-wide, we mean the center of cities.
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:10.480]   About 12 cities.
[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:11.200]   About 12 cities.
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:13.680]   But across the nation, it will be 12 cities.
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:15.200]   Oh, very important distinction.
[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:15.680]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:17.280]   Like everywhere in the nation.
[00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:17.600]   Yeah.
[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:19.120]   Verizon and Boston will have it in LA.
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:19.760]   Exactly.
[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:20.240]   And they're right.
[00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:21.200]   A couple in between.
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:21.920]   12 other cities.
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:22.560]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:23.120]   That's what this is.
[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:24.320]   Supertino.
[00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:24.960]   Yeah.
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:25.840]   I read that map.
[00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:27.920]   It's just this is going to be like red dots.
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:33.120]   I just hope that doesn't poison people's idea of 5G.
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:34.880]   Because if they think, oh, I've got this 5G phone, well,
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:38.240]   actually, it doesn't seem much faster than what I've got right now.
[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:43.040]   Because we're talking about with real 5G, much, much, much, much faster.
[00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:48.800]   And also much, much, much lower latency, which means that you could do things like a self-driving
[00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:51.520]   car that's not even necessarily self-driving.
[00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:56.240]   It could be piloted remotely by somebody just as almost just as accurately as somebody
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:57.520]   actually in the cockpit.
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:59.840]   So this is 5G is interesting.
[00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:03.040]   A, because of all the infrastructure that's going to have to be built in to make it work,
[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:06.000]   but also of all the new stuff that it's going to enable.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.760]   So I'd hate for people to think, oh, why bother like it?
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:11.920]   Why bother installing all this new infrastructure?
[00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:15.520]   Why bother all this new support?
[00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:20.720]   If all I can do is I'm still getting 480p streaming video on Netflix because they still
[00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:22.240]   won't give me 4K on my phone.
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:30.400]   So AT&T says they're 5GE, which is, again, as we hasten to point out, is not 5G of any--
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:33.600]   It's like crab with a K. It's not actual crab.
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:34.640]   It's really LTE.
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:36.160]   It gets average speeds.
[00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:41.040]   They say of about 40 megabits, although open signals measurements last year said that
[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:44.320]   AT&T's average 4G speed was 15, not 40.
[00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:49.280]   But even at 40, that's nowhere near the gigabit speeds 5G promises.
[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:50.160]   And we're not going to get gigabits.
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:51.520]   We're not going to see that.
[00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:52.080]   Yeah.
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:52.640]   I mean, yes.
[00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:59.440]   My grumpy feelings about this being a marketing ploy by AT&T are tempered by the fact that 5G
[00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:04.160]   is also kind of a marketing ploy and not entirely real and not something the most
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:06.720]   consumer's will be affected by for a long time.
[00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:11.200]   And so in the end, it's sort of like, you know, they all are trying to market stuff because
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:15.120]   they're trying to get churn in the industry and get people to believe that they've got
[00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:20.240]   the best network and planting seeds now that they can harvest later in a super bull ad next year.
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:22.400]   And, you know, it's all the cellular industry.
[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:25.680]   Like at some point, there are no heroes here.
[00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:27.200]   Well, not only that.
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:28.960]   Well, have you seen Verizon's?
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:29.960]   This really annoys me.
[00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:32.720]   The Verizon ads that were on the Super Bowl.
[00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:37.160]   We love first responders and they had the Chargers coach and all the people who saved
[00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:38.160]   his life.
[00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:44.080]   And as if, oh, but you know, that time when we cut off firefighters, high speed access
[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:48.960]   for the middle of the fire, in the middle of the worst fire in California's history,
[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:49.960]   that didn't really happen.
[00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:50.960]   I was a big misunderstanding.
[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:53.960]   It was just a misunderstanding.
[00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:56.080]   We never do it again, they said.
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:57.920]   We love first responders.
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:01.760]   So when I see this and that I just think these guys, just all of them, they're just
[00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:05.320]   all horrible people, horrible people.
[00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:08.960]   Yeah, this is the USA Today's headline.
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:14.600]   Verizon Super Bowl ads honor California's firefighters after throttling their data speeds.
[00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:20.400]   And I think that this is actually why T-Mobile has done so well, even though they're network.
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:21.760]   They seem more honest, don't they?
[00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:25.720]   Well, it's just that they're really, they're much more customer-centric.
[00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:31.360]   I mean, Verizon and AT&T have this, you know, they're the incumbents and they do all this
[00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:32.360]   crazy stuff.
[00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:34.840]   And T-Mobile does its own version of a lot of those things.
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:43.800]   Although John Ledger was not loathe to Don Maroon T-Mobile T-shirts and book the Trump
[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:49.200]   Hotel in Washington, D.C. the day after they asked for the merger was sprint.
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:50.400]   They were not above doing that.
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:51.400]   I think what I like-
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:53.680]   Sitting in the lobby, T-Mobile-
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:56.280]   See, what I like about him is that he's just open about it.
[00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:58.120]   He's like, there's no, there's no artifice there.
[00:18:58.120 --> 00:18:59.200]   He is just a shameless-
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:01.200]   He does live streams of slow cooking.
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:03.200]   Like, like it doesn't, he does like, parent's go to the lobby.
[00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:06.440]   That's exactly the kind of thing you would do if you wanted people to think you were a
[00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:07.440]   real person.
[00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:12.000]   You come down from your penthouse, you put on a T-shirt, you're a long-haired wig, and
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   you do slow cooking.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.880]   But I think that what's interesting is that he is, and I think he's an imperfect solution
[00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:18.880]   for this, but he-
[00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:21.680]   I'm a T-Mobile customer, I should say.
[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:25.800]   I think that he is an example, though, of where corporations are going to start having
[00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:29.400]   to go, where they're CEOs, their leaders have to be a lot more person, will have to be a
[00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:30.400]   lot more connected.
[00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:31.400]   These singers, they're lead singers.
[00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:35.360]   Yeah, and they have to really be out there and actually, you know, they can't be completely
[00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:36.360]   separated.
[00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:37.360]   They can't be disconnected.
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:39.000]   Or they hire a front man.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.880]   But they have to find somebody that's going to be, that people will connect to the company
[00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:42.880]   and connect to it.
[00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:47.680]   Because right now, what happens is with Twitter storms and everything else, you know, you've
[00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:49.560]   got to get ahead of it and stay ahead of it.
[00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:53.120]   And not get ahead of it like when it happens, but you have to spend years building trust
[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:54.120]   with people.
[00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:55.120]   Yeah, they're doing it.
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:56.120]   And that's going to come through authentic engagement.
[00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:58.840]   It's not going to come from, you know, another marketing campaign.
[00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:00.760]   Speaking of which, what is a T-Mobile Tuesday today?
[00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:01.920]   Is it tacos or socks?
[00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:02.920]   Tacos.
[00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:03.920]   Tacos.
[00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:04.920]   [laughs]
[00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:09.320]   You know, this was a very disappointing Super Bowl.
[00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:10.320]   Indeed.
[00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:12.080]   Not merely the commercials were horrible.
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:13.600]   The worst game ever.
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:16.000]   But commercials were not...
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   Microsoft was nice.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.840]   It was hard to touch your heart.
[00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:21.840]   Where were the Clydesdales?
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:23.080]   They weren't there.
[00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:24.080]   They were, but they weren't great.
[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:26.320]   They used to drone and some special effects.
[00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:27.320]   They had a dragon.
[00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:28.320]   Fly around.
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:31.120]   That was my favorite ad was the Game of Thrones ad that murdered the entire--
[00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:32.120]   That was very puzzling.
[00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:33.120]   That was very puzzling.
[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:37.120]   You know, actually the upper hand there were like, "Okay, here's what we're going to do.
[00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:39.040]   We're going to kill everybody in your ad campaign.
[00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:40.040]   Are you okay with that?"
[00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:41.040]   It's like, "Sure, great.
[00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:42.040]   Dragon?
[00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:43.040]   Yeah, let's do it."
[00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:45.720]   Was it an ad for Game of Thrones or was it an ad for beer?
[00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:48.880]   It was an ad for Game of Thrones where the Bud Light people were like, "You can use our
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:52.080]   stuff and we'll, yes, we'll collaborate with you."
[00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:57.800]   But apparently, Hia was searching for a partner they could do an ad like that for.
[00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:01.480]   And Bud Light apparently was okay with them and then said, "Well, can you just injure the
[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:02.640]   Bud Knight and not kill him?"
[00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:04.680]   And they're like, "No, that's not negotiable.
[00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:05.680]   He's going to die."
[00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:08.520]   I wonder if they went to Progressive and ask, "Can the dragon kill Flo?"
[00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:10.920]   And they'd be like, "No, we need to have that."
[00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:12.400]   "I would have dug that."
[00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:13.400]   "I would have dug that."
[00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:14.400]   Well, that's interesting.
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:17.800]   I thought I was very confused as I'm sure everybody at home was.
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:19.960]   "What is it that you're watching a Bud Light commercial?"
[00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:21.520]   "It's got the Bud Light Knight."
[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:26.040]   By the way, we've already seen 100 Bud Light commercials having to do with high fructose
[00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:28.760]   corn syrup for some reason.
[00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:34.720]   And then the Bud Light Knight and he's jousting and he gets knocked off his horse and then
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:39.080]   a dragon comes and fries him to a crisp.
[00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:43.080]   And it says, "Winter is coming" or something, Game of Thrones, April 14th.
[00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:44.920]   It's like, "What did I...
[00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:45.920]   I was very confused."
[00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:46.920]   Well, it was worth it.
[00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:49.760]   Maybe it's because I had a couple of Bud Lights before the year.
[00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:57.840]   I like the teaser for the new CBS Twilight Zone where go to color bars and then CBS Network
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:21:59.280]   has been knocked offline.
[00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:00.280]   That was good.
[00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:01.280]   It was cool.
[00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:04.160]   Not only was it appropriate, but later on there's...
[00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:10.560]   Someone had the memo that was absolutely sent with top priority to every technician in the
[00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:15.480]   CBS Network saying, "Warning, at eight seconds into this commercial, you're going to see
[00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:16.480]   color bars."
[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:21.400]   And a car run that says that CBS is off the air, "Do not do anything.
[00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:23.040]   This is part of the commercial.
[00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:25.600]   Do not switch back to your local broadcasting.
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:27.560]   Nothing is going to freak out."
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:31.720]   This guy is probably just watching his sports bets on Monitor 3.
[00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:32.720]   That's only...
[00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:33.720]   Oh, crap.
[00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:34.720]   There was a controversy.
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:39.240]   I'm trying to remember what company it was where they did a couple of seconds of dead
[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:40.240]   air in the UK.
[00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:42.960]   It was a minute of dead air in the UK.
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:47.800]   I'm really upset people because they thought something went and banged on the TV.
[00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:54.160]   When I saw this coming, I saw, "Oh, they quickly showed that it wasn't really...
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:55.800]   Here's the Budnight.
[00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:58.640]   He just got knocked down."
[00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:02.240]   This is kind of a surprise because we've been watching these commercials this whole
[00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:03.240]   time.
[00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:06.880]   It's a clever reference to Game of Thrones, and it turns out no, it is actually Game
[00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:07.880]   of Thrones.
[00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:08.880]   Yeah, oh, there's the Hound, right?
[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:10.840]   Yeah, that's the Mountain, I think.
[00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:15.960]   He tears his head off the Budnight, and then the drag comes over and everybody did that.
[00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:17.920]   Your commercials are stupid.
[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:19.560]   You've been hijacked.
[00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:21.120]   Your commercial's been...
[00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:22.120]   What?
[00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:25.520]   And the Budlight King dies horribly.
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:26.520]   Yes.
[00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:28.800]   I thought that was hysterical.
[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:30.800]   Especially for people who hate that commercial.
[00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:31.800]   I was unclear.
[00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:32.800]   Yeah.
[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:36.200]   That's why Flo would drink the imported beers and yolk, really.
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:37.200]   What if you kind of get...
[00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:39.120]   You know, it's lovely.
[00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:42.400]   I want the pear mead with my nice mouth feel.
[00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:43.400]   I want that.
[00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:44.400]   Never mind.
[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:45.400]   We're from Northern California.
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:46.400]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:47.400]   We're the people they're mocking.
[00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:48.400]   I know.
[00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:50.520]   Well, they know people with good taste don't drink their beer already, so they...
[00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:51.880]   Why not market to them?
[00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:52.880]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:53.880]   Right?
[00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:55.600]   Like, let's we admit it, which is what they do, so great.
[00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:56.600]   Good for them.
[00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:58.560]   All right, anything else to say about 12.2?
[00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:02.640]   Believe it or not, that's the conversation we're having right now.
[00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:05.280]   This is only so much you can say about, "Oh, good.
[00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:09.680]   No micro updates to Apple TV at device, which you're probably not using."
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:11.360]   Dude, we got 21 minutes out of it.
[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:14.600]   I think we've done our job here today.
[00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:16.720]   So let's take a break and there is still much to talk about.
[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:18.400]   I'm not stretching.
[00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:20.120]   I have so much material.
[00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:22.120]   We've got the first quarter results.
[00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:23.120]   We could be.
[00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:25.400]   We've got the quarterly results and we've got graphs.
[00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:30.200]   We've got the FaceTime, you know, Scuttlebutt.
[00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:31.200]   And we've got...
[00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:34.280]   Facebook, Apple's new Glass Panel MacBook keyboards.
[00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:35.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:36.280]   Oh, that's a good one.
[00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:37.280]   A bunch of winners.
[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:45.040]   Winner, winner, chicken dinner, but first a word from ZipRecruiter, the best way to hire.
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:50.240]   And we know that right here because we use them and it's always amazing when we go online
[00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:52.760]   with ZipRecruiter and place an ad.
[00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:56.880]   How fast we get great responses and now I understand why.
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:57.880]   ZipRecruiter's smart.
[00:24:57.880 --> 00:24:59.880]   You know what's not smart?
[00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:05.040]   A job board that will send you a hundred million resumes for candidates that just aren't qualified.
[00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:07.640]   What a waste of time to have to go through all of those.
[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:08.640]   You know what is smart?
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:12.240]   Going to ziprecruiter.com/macbreak and hiring the right person.
[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:17.640]   Of course, we've mentioned many times one post on ZipRecruiter goes to 100 plus job boards
[00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:19.200]   and all the social networks.
[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:20.760]   But it's more than that.
[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:25.720]   Unlike other job sites, ZipRecruiter finds qualified candidates for you.
[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:31.440]   That's why we immediately within a few hours of posting get really good candidates.
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:32.920]   It's powerful matching technology.
[00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:33.920]   Here's what they do.
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:36.240]   They go through thousands of resumes.
[00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:41.200]   They already have actually they're being when they say thousands, they're being humble.
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:43.520]   It's millions of current resumes.
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:47.640]   They identify people with the right skills, education, and experience.
[00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:50.280]   We even got people local.
[00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:54.000]   Like we said, no, we want them to be near here and we got people from Petaluma.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.440]   It's awesome.
[00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:59.080]   Then it goes to them and it says, "You should, this is a great job you should apply to."
[00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:04.240]   So you're going to get qualified candidates fast often within 24 hours.
[00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:08.160]   That's why ZipRecruiter is rated number one by employers in the US.
[00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:12.440]   That's from trust to pilot compared with other hiring sites.
[00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:14.280]   Over a thousand reviews.
[00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:15.840]   Number one.
[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:17.520]   Right now you can try ZipRecruiter for free.
[00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:20.160]   You got to go to ziprecruiter.com/macbreak.
[00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:24.800]   I'm not kidding.
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:27.640]   You will get responses so fast.
[00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:28.800]   Not junk.
[00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:30.000]   You only get the best.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.680]   Of course, this is a recruiter interface.
[00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:33.360]   Makes it very easy.
[00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:35.160]   You can have screening questions.
[00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:39.440]   You can have multiple choice or even essays and screen out people who just aren't right
[00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:41.880]   for the job without you even looking at them.
[00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:46.440]   They pre-format their resumes so they all look great and similar in the interface.
[00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:47.440]   They don't go to your inbox.
[00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:48.520]   They don't go to your phone number.
[00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:50.520]   They come right into that interface.
[00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:53.800]   You can screen them, rate them, and hire the right person fast.
[00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:57.240]   ziprecruiter.com/macbreak.
[00:26:57.240 --> 00:27:01.760]   ZipRecruiter is the smartest way to hire.
[00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:07.240]   Apple said we're sorry about the FaceTime bug and I love this and we're going to give
[00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:08.480]   the kid the bug bounty.
[00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:10.840]   Good for them.
[00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:11.840]   Yeah.
[00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:14.960]   So this actually was this last week.
[00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:17.880]   It feels like this has been a thing of broke on Tuesday.
[00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:18.880]   Yeah.
[00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:26.560]   So at the time we were kind of puzzled about this report that a mom and a 14-year-old
[00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:29.040]   had discovered it a week earlier.
[00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:30.040]   We weren't sure.
[00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:33.480]   In fact, I think we mentioned we said something like, "Well, the Twitter account might be
[00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:34.480]   new.
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:35.480]   We don't know."
[00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:37.160]   It turns out, no, she's real.
[00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:43.200]   Grant Thompson and his mom founded a week before the security researchers did a week before
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:45.880]   9 to 5 Mac proved it.
[00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:52.320]   His mother tweeted Apple and then I think later went to Apple's support.
[00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:57.440]   Apple's support about January 22nd directed them to file a radar bug report in order
[00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:58.440]   to do that.
[00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:02.360]   By the way, I think we kind of, and everybody misreported that they said, "No, you have
[00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:03.360]   to be a developer."
[00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:07.640]   No, they said, "Go fire a radar bug report," which is where bug reports get filed.
[00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:11.800]   It turns out though in order to do that, you have to register a developer account, which
[00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:12.880]   is not a huge.
[00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:14.640]   Do you have to pay?
[00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:18.080]   It used to be 99 months, right?
[00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:19.080]   Okay.
[00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:23.920]   Can't use the basic developer account for just a lot of what things out.
[00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:28.440]   Yeah, just don't know if you're just an Apple ID, but yeah, the knee-jerk reaction of so
[00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:30.800]   many people at Apple is file a radar.
[00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:34.520]   And this is like, the problem is this is a security hole, right?
[00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:35.920]   They should not get tossed in radar.
[00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:40.280]   Anybody who's used radar, Apple's bug reporter knows that, at least from the outside, it
[00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:43.960]   appears to be a black hole where bug reports, I thought you were going to say, Leo, where
[00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:48.960]   bug reports go to die, because that's kind of what happens with so many things filed
[00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:49.960]   to radar.
[00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:50.960]   And it is...
[00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:53.560]   I hear this complaint though, we've had exactly the same claim that Microsoft, remember there
[00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:59.880]   was a terrible Windows bug that deleted data, and Microsoft apparently knew about it for
[00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:03.520]   months, or well, it had been reported for months, but Microsoft paid a lot.
[00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:09.640]   Yeah, but like a zero-day security exploit that lets you listen in or see people in their
[00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:12.960]   homes feels like a little bit of an escalation.
[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:18.160]   Yeah, but I think when you have a confirmation that somebody at Apple actually saw this report
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:23.760]   that this person tried to file, it seems like the first thing you do is, gosh, I work at
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:28.000]   Apple, I have access to an iPhone, I should try it right here, and then file your own
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.560]   bug report when you find out that, oh, dear, this is real.
[00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:34.600]   It's when they...
[00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:35.600]   I think was...
[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:38.320]   Did Tim Cook directly post on Friday to...
[00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:42.280]   I think it was one of the Mac blogs about, okay, looks like we're not going to have our
[00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:46.320]   fix this week, likely promise, but it's going to be here next week.
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:50.880]   By the way, since I got your ear, I do understand that this should have been escalated much
[00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:51.880]   more quickly.
[00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:57.160]   Now, we're going to be looking at our process for receiving these bugs and escalating it.
[00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:58.160]   They apologize.
[00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:01.200]   They did acknowledge that, yeah, we should not have...
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:04.280]   They told us we didn't do anything, and that's a problem that we should fix.
[00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:09.120]   The mom, Michelle Thompson, says that on Friday, an unnamed Apple executive flew out to see
[00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:14.320]   them in Tucson, and he may, in fact, get Apple's bug bounty, which could be something like
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:15.320]   $25,000.
[00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:17.080]   Yeah, no, it's good.
[00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:23.000]   I think, look, this is troubling because this was a huge issue with a lot of fallout
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.400]   and seemed to just fall through the cracks.
[00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:30.920]   At the same time, I do think, and again, I'm trying to say this is a big thing, we don't
[00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:36.160]   understand, I think, most of us, the scale of one of these big companies in terms of what
[00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:38.240]   comes in over the transom.
[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:42.920]   It's not like there's a person sitting at a desk with a telephone waiting for it to ring,
[00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:47.560]   and then suddenly a kid from Tucson calls in like a slightly somebody to talk to.
[00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:51.720]   It's more like just thousands of calls, and it's mostly garbage, right?
[00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:53.880]   It's like 99.9 percent of it is not...
[00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:57.120]   I can't figure out how to turn off my Wi-Fi.
[00:30:57.120 --> 00:31:02.520]   Like 2 percent of its bugs, and 0.01 percent of it is actual legit security issues, and
[00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:04.440]   the challenge is how do you filter that out?
[00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:05.440]   And they failed.
[00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:06.920]   They totally failed here.
[00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:11.640]   And it's too bad, but it is a brutal test of one of these big companies.
[00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:15.960]   You have a lot of people out there answering those phone calls, and we can't expect every
[00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:20.680]   person that picks up the phone to treat it like an executive would.
[00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:25.160]   Every person that's handling customer support when you call is going to treat it as if Tim
[00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:28.320]   Cook would treat it when someone called and said there's a problem.
[00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:31.320]   This is one of, as Jason said, a whole bunch of calls.
[00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:32.760]   And they literally may not know.
[00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:36.760]   It may not register how dangerous or bad this could be.
[00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:37.760]   And it is.
[00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:42.560]   I have a feeling this was probably connected to the group call.
[00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:43.560]   Yeah.
[00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:47.160]   And LZ was around until 12, 1, 3, or whatever it was came out.
[00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:48.160]   I've got to get rid of it.
[00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:49.160]   Group calling is...
[00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:51.560]   I have a lot of experience with group calling.
[00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:54.160]   He's the expert.
[00:31:54.160 --> 00:32:01.360]   Group calling is super complex as far as how you manage everybody hearing everybody else,
[00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:04.440]   because it's all mixed minuses, and it's all going back and forth, and it's all dealing
[00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:07.160]   with multiple data rates.
[00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:08.160]   And that's a FaceTime.
[00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:13.840]   When they say, "Oh, we got up to 32 people in FaceTime," that is an incredible feat.
[00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:19.240]   And I know that there is an enormous amount of attention that was spent on other group
[00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:23.760]   calling platforms to make sure that exactly what we saw there didn't happen.
[00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:25.320]   Do you think that all they talked about was that?
[00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:26.840]   That actually is a legit question.
[00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:31.280]   Do you think that that was a bug that should not have slipped through?
[00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:33.560]   It's a bug that you don't think about until you do it once.
[00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:34.560]   It quietly would have known.
[00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:35.560]   What you're saying?
[00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:37.560]   It happened in other platforms.
[00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:40.200]   It's just that no one knows.
[00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:41.200]   We had issues where...
[00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:45.560]   Those who don't know what happened is if you added yourself to the group call with...
[00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:50.040]   I call Alex, but I add myself, make it a group call, and then when the call comes in, I answer
[00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:54.680]   it on my second account, and it turns out that answers it on Alex's account, even though
[00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:57.880]   he has it picked up, and I can hear and see what's going on in Alex's account.
[00:32:57.880 --> 00:32:58.880]   I think it's telling...
[00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:00.320]   He picks up our hands up.
[00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:04.800]   It's telling that this is a feature that got delayed, which means it probably because of
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:08.360]   QA problems, because of quality issues.
[00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:11.440]   You've got to wonder, did it get fully tested because it got delayed?
[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:14.080]   Was there pressure to put it out there?
[00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:18.960]   I don't want to undermine the complexity of these issues at the same time, given what
[00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:25.280]   was required to duplicate this bug and knowing people who are software testers and QA engineers,
[00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:30.040]   like pushing the wrong button at the wrong time and adding yourself and all that.
[00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:33.240]   This is like software testing 101 stuff.
[00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:35.400]   So I'm kind of shocked that this bug got delayed.
[00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:36.800]   Yeah, that's what really surprised me.
[00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:42.000]   That was not something that, oh, if you put this special file in a special directory,
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:47.360]   it activates X, or if you happen to have had it plugged into Firewire instead of lightning,
[00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:52.440]   no, again, this is like the monkey scripts that you usually put together, or at least
[00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:58.200]   I was aware of people putting together, that's just monkeys pushing random buttons automatically.
[00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:02.880]   And then the script reports back if something happened, it was not anticipated.
[00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:06.200]   So that was very, very surprising to me.
[00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:11.240]   And also, like I mentioned this last week, when we were quickly talking about it, that
[00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:17.840]   this is why I think that you are inviting bad mojo on yourself when you buy a huge billboard
[00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:23.360]   saying that the iPhone is the bastion of security and privacy, which is, again, this
[00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:25.360]   was an accident.
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:28.320]   Like Alex said, other platforms have had this problem.
[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:35.360]   But when you're going to really slam dunk that point so hard, it really invites God
[00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:39.760]   to say, hey, wouldn't it be funny if we made this happen on all their phones?
[00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:42.320]   I guess it was all everyone would talk about for an entire week.
[00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:45.920]   I guess I would say, though, I appreciate the fact that they did that because it does raise
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:48.480]   the bar and it means that they're going to have to play at a harder thing.
[00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:51.120]   And something like this looks particularly bad because of that.
[00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:53.760]   And I think that that's good because it means Apple is going to have to keep on moving down
[00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:54.760]   that path.
[00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:58.080]   I think they're there's too much to acknowledge it and they didn't they didn't try to deny
[00:34:58.080 --> 00:34:59.080]   it.
[00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:00.480]   They said, this is a problem we should have solved.
[00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:04.000]   And we were moving to solve it as opposed to, I can't believe that you think this is
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   a problem.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   I mean, this isn't a problem.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.800]   Do you realize how few people were affected by this thing that you call a problem?
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:09.960]   So funny, you think it's a problem.
[00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:14.280]   And I think that I think that their secrecy is part of the problem too, because what happened
[00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:20.920]   is that for other platforms that are group calling, we would file two or three pretty
[00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:23.200]   rough bugs a week.
[00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:26.440]   And we would literally say, if you do it this way, this way, this way, this way, this way,
[00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:27.440]   this is what's going to come out.
[00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:32.000]   And it's because we were doing all these uncontrolled events, the guys that are testing it, they
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.920]   get into a zone of, oh, you click this and click this and click this.
[00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:38.320]   And then what we were doing was clicking a different order than they were.
[00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:41.520]   And when they're testing it, they get into this pattern of this is how they do it.
[00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:45.080]   And until it goes out into the public, you don't think of another pattern.
[00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:48.720]   Like you don't even think another pattern would be possible when you do it until you
[00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:49.720]   do it.
[00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:51.520]   I'm going to be in the rare position of defending Apple here.
[00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:53.080]   I'm just on the other side.
[00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:54.240]   But bugs happen.
[00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:56.080]   Bugs slip through.
[00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:57.960]   Bugs are hard to get.
[00:35:57.960 --> 00:35:59.520]   Apple did respond.
[00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:05.760]   And I also understand why Grant Thompson and Michelle Thompson's report was missed.
[00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:10.560]   I think once it became public in a way that Apple had to pay attention to, they responded
[00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:11.560]   very quickly.
[00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:15.040]   I think shutting down group FaceTime was a big move, right?
[00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:16.840]   Because you're breaking a feature for a lot of people.
[00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:18.760]   And it was absolutely the right thing to do.
[00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:19.760]   Without hesitation.
[00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:20.760]   And they did it.
[00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:21.760]   Yeah.
[00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:25.440]   Grant, by the way, says he also feels the same way.
[00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:27.280]   He was on CNBC's Squawk Box.
[00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:31.160]   He said he'll still use Apple products every now and then something like this just falls
[00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:33.400]   through the cracks and can be found.
[00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:36.280]   He says, I believe Apple's still trying to protect user privacy.
[00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:43.160]   I love it that his mom said if he did get some bug bounty money for what he found, we'd
[00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:47.400]   certainly put a good use for his college because I think he's going to go far hopefully.
[00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:51.480]   This is actually a field he was interested in before and even more so now he gets 25
[00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:52.480]   grand.
[00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:56.480]   I think you've guaranteed this guy's going to be a security researcher when he gets
[00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:57.480]   out of school.
[00:36:57.480 --> 00:36:58.480]   Yeah.
[00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:00.480]   For $25,000, he's not going to go very far in college.
[00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:01.480]   That's what's cool.
[00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:02.480]   That's my boy.
[00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:03.480]   Unfortunately.
[00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:04.480]   Yeah.
[00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:05.480]   That's what's cool.
[00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:11.080]   No, I think that Apple handled this as well as they could given everything.
[00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:16.120]   I wish the way the story had gone is that they had found out and shut down group FaceTime
[00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:19.120]   and everybody's like, "Oh, group FaceTime is down.
[00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:20.120]   What's going on?"
[00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:22.760]   And then they would say, "Well, we found a bug and we're fixing it and in the meantime
[00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:24.200]   it's going to be down for a week."
[00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:25.400]   Every company wishes that.
[00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:26.400]   That's responsible disclosure.
[00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:27.400]   Sure.
[00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:28.960]   And it just didn't work out this time.
[00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:34.800]   What I really want is for Apple to, and I'm sure they're doing this, to look at every
[00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:39.520]   point of failure in this, because that's the thing that they need to get better, is
[00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:42.640]   like, "How did we fail to get this?
[00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:48.400]   What process was missing to get this report at all of these different points flagged as
[00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:49.800]   potentially enormous?
[00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:54.440]   Like, did we not have enough QA resources to duplicate this?
[00:37:54.440 --> 00:38:00.240]   Did we shunted into the wrong bin in our support or our bug reporter?
[00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:04.320]   Like that, to me, it's the learning experience here.
[00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:05.880]   Because this is going to happen again.
[00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:09.960]   Something's going to come in off, probably comes in on the transom every few months,
[00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:11.200]   every few weeks.
[00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:12.760]   They need, and they failed here.
[00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:14.000]   They completely failed.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.120]   So how do they learn from that and change their processes to be better?
[00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:20.160]   They're not going to be perfect, but they could at least make them better than they were
[00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:21.160]   this time.
[00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:24.480]   New York Attorney General, Leticia James and Governor Andrew Cuomo have announced their
[00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:26.480]   intent to investigate.
[00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:27.480]   You won't.
[00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:28.480]   You won't.
[00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:31.400]   You know, investigation doesn't mean prosecution.
[00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:33.160]   I mean, these are politicians.
[00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:39.200]   This is publicity that is the most traditional and transparent being a publicity hound that
[00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:40.200]   you could possibly do.
[00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:43.280]   I'm amazed that it's the governor and the attorney general.
[00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:46.640]   Usually it's the attorney general's who use this because they're trying to be governor.
[00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:48.320]   Because they want to be governor.
[00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:51.160]   And Andrew Cuomo has forgotten he's already governor.
[00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:52.160]   Exactly.
[00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:57.960]   And then the lawsuit from the Texas, from lawyer in Texas is a little more interesting
[00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:05.720]   because he's claiming that because of this, because of this bug, a private deposition
[00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:11.600]   was not could have been, but was eavesdropped upon, which makes me think that how did you
[00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:14.560]   know that someone was eavesdropping on this?
[00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:18.880]   So unless this is a lawyer trying to make more money from suing Apple than he could have
[00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:23.040]   with other thing he was taking a deposition on, I'd like to see exactly what the, what
[00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:24.040]   he's actually saying happened.
[00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:29.480]   Well, that's why I wasn't too perturbed about it because you can't just listen indefinitely,
[00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:30.480]   right?
[00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:32.520]   I mean, mighty long time.
[00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:33.520]   Really?
[00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:38.520]   And so if the person falls until the call doesn't hear notifications, he won't know that he's
[00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:41.280]   in a FaceTime call until later.
[00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:45.080]   I mean, he didn't choose to see that you were in a FaceTime call.
[00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:52.360]   I, I got the impression that at best you might get 20 seconds because the face, well, maybe
[00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:55.960]   not though, if you, okay, you have to, you're now in the call.
[00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:57.880]   Yeah, I guess the call has to be terminated.
[00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:01.280]   I mean, I think the, the answer there is going to be that they'll do some discovery and find
[00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:02.600]   out if that actually happened.
[00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:08.120]   And if it did, I imagine Apple will probably have to pay damages, but I, you know, the
[00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:09.760]   funny thing, well, it's not funny.
[00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:15.520]   I say that is that so many of these bugs that are publicly disclosed are known, right?
[00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:17.680]   They're known, but not publicly.
[00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:21.560]   And the question is not, I mean, maybe there's something involving a deposition or something
[00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:22.560]   like that.
[00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:26.320]   But I think also the question is, are there state agents that were using this to spy on
[00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:27.320]   people?
[00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:32.520]   Because, you know, oftentimes it's known and all the spy agencies are using these kinds
[00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:35.000]   of approaches and then they don't, you know, they don't want it.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   Yeah, that's the point.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   It's not known by Apple.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:40.600]   It's known by three letter agencies who are damned if they're going to tell anybody.
[00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:41.600]   Exactly.
[00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:44.480]   So that's scary where you're listening to a political dissident or, you know, whoever
[00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:46.440]   and you're spying on them against their knowledge.
[00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:50.000]   I guess, you know, we're all sitting here with iPhones that could be in a FaceTime call
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   right now.
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:55.400]   You know, this is what this is what I get when people say I'm never going to have a never
[00:40:55.400 --> 00:41:00.160]   going to have an old never going to have a, you know, any of these assistants in my house.
[00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:02.000]   I don't want a microphone in my bedroom or something.
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:07.240]   It's like every device you own is a microphone and a camera, like every single one.
[00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:10.080]   And that's just be aware of it.
[00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:15.040]   If you want security, if you want security, you leave all the electronics at the door.
[00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:19.680]   Yeah, it's it's it's also why you imagine with everything you imagine, what is the worst
[00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:25.320]   case, not even likely, but even out outlying scenario, how bad is it and how bad would
[00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:31.680]   it be to my life if I suddenly found out that I was exploited that my technology was exploited
[00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:32.680]   that way.
[00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:37.920]   And that is why I have a little tab of gaffer's tape blocking every single camera that saw
[00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:39.120]   my laptop and everything else.
[00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:41.760]   Because this thing is right right next to my bed.
[00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:44.760]   And it's like in my living room and it moves around with me.
[00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:53.600]   And normally it's there to prevent me from showing up in a in a group meeting, unshaven
[00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:57.640]   and a t-shirt that I slept in because I didn't know this is going to be a video conference
[00:41:57.640 --> 00:41:58.640]   call.
[00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:00.800]   That's me more than any of the other stuff.
[00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:02.600]   That's a real danger.
[00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:06.960]   But also because of because of situations like this, there is no way you can get around
[00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:11.960]   a piece of piece of gaffer tape actually physically blocking the lens.
[00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:19.000]   And I think that you might see an actual, advertising feature on laptops and other devices that
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:22.360]   know there is an actual slide that covers the camera that you can turn on.
[00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:23.360]   It's quite a few.
[00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:24.360]   Yeah.
[00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:25.360]   Yeah.
[00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:29.280]   And here's a physical switch that electronically isolates the microphone surgery from everything
[00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:30.280]   else.
[00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:32.800]   Even Facebook's portal shipped with a crappy piece of plastic you can put over there.
[00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:36.200]   I mean, even if you go all the way back to eyesight, the eyesight, you just turn the
[00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:37.200]   little bezel and it closed.
[00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:38.200]   I remember that.
[00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:43.480]   And not only that, but there would be an actual white dot like the the iris was actually white
[00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:48.480]   to actually see, okay, I can I can actually change into my dinner clothes because I can
[00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:53.560]   see that I can see physically that there is no camera pointed at me that can actually
[00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:54.560]   show off my eyes.
[00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:57.360]   This is a little bit of a narcissistic point of view though that somebody might want to
[00:42:57.360 --> 00:42:59.160]   see you changing your clothes.
[00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:01.760]   No, but I don't want to see you changing your clothes.
[00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:02.760]   No, that's.
[00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:03.760]   Yeah.
[00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:07.000]   I mean, there are actual search engines for look for searching.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:11.240]   No, there are actual search engines that will find you open exactly open webcams.
[00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:13.600]   I do flatter to be honest.
[00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:17.400]   Oh, God, don't don't put that in the show.
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:19.240]   They could broadcast everywhere.
[00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:25.000]   That's like, I just want everybody know I do not put tape over any of the cameras.
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   They're all wide open.
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:29.280]   So we're going to see if we can get some press out of this.
[00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:34.800]   What was that CEO with the with like the the private information locking?
[00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:38.440]   Hey, I put my actual city life was a number on a billboard.
[00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:40.600]   I dare you to try to go down.
[00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:41.920]   Oh, it didn't go well.
[00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:44.080]   It didn't go well.
[00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:50.600]   What a surprise hackers actually a pretty pretty skilled Apple spanked Facebook and Google
[00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:51.600]   this week.
[00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:56.520]   It turns out both Facebook and Google were using enterprise certificates, which a lot
[00:43:56.520 --> 00:44:04.040]   of companies use by the way to do internal applications on iPhones and Android devices.
[00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:08.640]   Those certificates allow people to bypass the Apple store.
[00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:14.760]   Facebook was and Google were both using it to get apps that essentially broke Apple's
[00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:18.720]   privacy policies by spying on the users of the app.
[00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:21.440]   Now it was of course they were billed that way.
[00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:24.080]   And in fact, users were paid for using the app.
[00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:27.040]   And the at least with Facebook, the intent was pretty clear.
[00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:29.080]   It was aimed at 13 to 35 year olds.
[00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:30.080]   It's market research.
[00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:31.080]   They want to watch everything you do.
[00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:32.080]   They want to know what kids are doing.
[00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:34.080]   So they can buy that company.
[00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:35.080]   There's the big issue.
[00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:37.560]   There's a big difference between how each of them did it.
[00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:42.000]   Well, and Facebook actually was nasty because they had an app almost identical Apple Colo
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:48.560]   novo, which in the app store in the app store and Apple yanked and said to be a VPN privacy
[00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:51.800]   solution that was actually in addition to being a VPN.
[00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:54.880]   It was a VPN through Facebook where Facebook got to look at all the data.
[00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:55.880]   Right.
[00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:59.880]   And I'm a spanked him at that time and pulled it off the app store and Facebook said, oh,
[00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:00.880]   we'll never do that again.
[00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:06.240]   Then it turns out that this new Facebook app was basically the same code.
[00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:07.240]   Yes.
[00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:08.240]   Rebranded.
[00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:11.120]   And so that's why I think Apple took this a little bit farther.
[00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:14.480]   And the enterprise certificate, the thing you need to know about it is that it is, as
[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:20.480]   you said, the goal is you use it for your internal, your employees and what both of these companies
[00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:23.720]   did and the Google and Facebook stories are indeed different.
[00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:28.720]   But both of them were using it as a method to distribute apps to people who are outside
[00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:29.720]   their company.
[00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:32.520]   And that's in the Google store, by the way.
[00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:33.760]   And that's still there.
[00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:34.760]   Sure.
[00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:37.280]   So that was in violation of Apple's terms, which is, you know, the only way you get to
[00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:40.880]   bypass the app store is if you agree, it's only for your employees.
[00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:42.360]   And they didn't do that.
[00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:46.560]   And in addition, they were using this to get around an app store rejection.
[00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:49.200]   And that was when Apple turned off the certificate.
[00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:51.200]   Which had an app's big impact.
[00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:54.720]   Nobody Facebook knew it was for lunch and they couldn't call their bus.
[00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:57.400]   They couldn't Google people couldn't get the bus.
[00:45:57.400 --> 00:45:59.440]   So there were apps that stopped working.
[00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:03.560]   In both cases, Apple restored access a day or two later.
[00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:05.840]   But it messaged, I mean, it's a shot across the ballot.
[00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:06.840]   Message is very clear.
[00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:07.840]   Don't mess with this.
[00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:08.840]   Yeah.
[00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:11.800]   Because I think that the conversation that happened after this is, this is your enterprise
[00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:12.800]   apps.
[00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:13.800]   What happens if we turn off the other ones?
[00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:14.800]   Uh huh.
[00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:17.520]   You know, like, like, let's be clear, like, don't do the, you know, and I think the problem
[00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:23.360]   is is number one is that by giving them all that data is that all their friends, all
[00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:24.840]   that, you know, it's not just their data.
[00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:28.600]   When you touch somebody and you give away all the communication that they're having,
[00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:30.880]   you're giving away the communication that they're having with their friends.
[00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:32.600]   And their friends did not agree to that.
[00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:36.680]   And I do want to point out though, this happens every single time you say, yes, download
[00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:38.120]   my contacts list.
[00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:39.120]   Yes.
[00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:42.960]   We were just talking about this on iOS today, the TikTok.
[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:46.320]   First thing you can't really even add people on TikTok until you give them your contacts.
[00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:49.960]   At which point you are giving up your friends.
[00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:50.960]   Yeah.
[00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:56.080]   If I go in and if I, if I'm going to use a Facebook login, which I don't use anymore,
[00:46:56.080 --> 00:46:57.240]   but I would always go in and turn it off.
[00:46:57.240 --> 00:47:00.120]   And if it wouldn't let me go in because I was turning off friends, I was like, I'm not
[00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:01.120]   going to use it.
[00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:02.120]   I don't want to play.
[00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:03.120]   Well, I'll see.
[00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:06.640]   I mean, the other thing is that we're, most people are thinking mostly about how, okay,
[00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:10.800]   well, the Facebook is using this to scrape more information about individuals for advertising
[00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:11.800]   profiles.
[00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:16.480]   But we forget that it was, it's not just that, but in Facebook's case, it's the ability
[00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:20.840]   to see all the other apps on the user's phone and how much time they're spending on each
[00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:22.280]   one of them.
[00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:27.720]   When the, the, the previous iteration of this app is one of the reasons why Facebook decided
[00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:31.600]   to buy WhatsApp because they were able to see through this app that my God, people are
[00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:35.080]   using this, this thing called WhatsApp that we've never heard of instead of the Facebook
[00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:36.080]   messenger.
[00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:37.080]   This is good.
[00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:39.480]   We should, we should buy out this company while we still can.
[00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:40.480]   And they're also doing it.
[00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:41.480]   There are an accident.
[00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:46.440]   Five percent of the users of this bad app, not on Ava, but the subsequent bad app were
[00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:47.440]   our teenagers.
[00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:50.040]   Now Facebook's got their parents permission.
[00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:51.040]   Yeah, sure.
[00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:54.600]   Yeah, but which they, which they, which they have to do, you can't even do a study as a
[00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:58.800]   research group to do a study unless you have a signed document from parents saying you have
[00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:02.960]   my permission to get access to this information from my 14 year old.
[00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:06.920]   And so Facebook, this is, this is kind of like what I was mentioning earlier about at
[00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:09.360]   least Apple when they screwed up, they said, we screwed up.
[00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:10.360]   Here's how we screwed up.
[00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:12.920]   We're going to try not to screw up and we're going to try to fix these things.
[00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:18.000]   Books at all, but no, nobody used, nobody under the HR 18 unless they had a signed document
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:23.160]   from their, and number one, they were actually being advertised without being told to, without
[00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:25.560]   being told this was a Facebook research app.
[00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:28.920]   Number one, directly with the name of the app was Facebook research app.
[00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:34.560]   So, but no, because you can have a third party saying here, we want to do research on Facebook.
[00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:37.320]   That was another, another case.
[00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:41.440]   They're also, well, then, yeah, and why, how come you didn't know this was related to
[00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:45.320]   Facebook until you actually tried to sign up for this thing.
[00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:49.320]   But the other thing is that, so, oh yeah, we had, we had signed things for everybody.
[00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:53.840]   But of course, as if they don't think they don't know that everyone who's writing about
[00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:57.480]   this story is then going to try to sign up for this and well, guess what?
[00:48:57.480 --> 00:48:59.040]   I'm 14 years old.
[00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:00.040]   Click a checkbox.
[00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:01.040]   Great.
[00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:02.040]   You're in.
[00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:03.160]   Do I have my parents permission?
[00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:04.160]   Absolutely.
[00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:05.160]   Click, checkbox and you're in.
[00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:07.440]   I don't know if that is the case.
[00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:09.240]   So go ahead and try that.
[00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:11.840]   I don't want to impune them improperly.
[00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:16.200]   The key facts about this market research program are being ignored according to Facebook.
[00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:19.160]   Despite early reports, there was nothing secret about this.
[00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:22.200]   It was literally called the Facebook research app.
[00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:25.120]   Now, they say also, it wasn't spying.
[00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:28.640]   All the people who signed up to participate went through a clear onboard process asking
[00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:32.800]   for their permission and were paid to participate $20 a month in gift cards.
[00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:36.040]   Finally, less than 5% of the people who chose to participate were teens.
[00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:37.560]   All of them with signed.
[00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:38.560]   I don't know what that means.
[00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:39.560]   Parental consult.
[00:49:39.560 --> 00:49:43.400]   I'd like to have the job of writing the apology/explanation blog post.
[00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:44.400]   I think it's a whole department.
[00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:45.400]   It's a gross industry.
[00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:46.400]   It's a gross industry.
[00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:47.880]   I think it's a growing department.
[00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:51.240]   I think so when this story broke, I heard from a lot of people who were very cynical
[00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:54.640]   about what Apple's response would be and they said because they're and I know a lot of
[00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:55.640]   I know a lot of apps.
[00:49:55.640 --> 00:49:59.720]   Could Apple have spanked them a little less hard or did they have?
[00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:01.360]   I think Apple, I don't know the details.
[00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:04.400]   My guess is they probably could have just shut down this one app and they did a little
[00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:09.760]   bit more and I think Apple is trying to put a little daylight between bad actors within
[00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:12.360]   Facebook and the rest of the Facebook employees.
[00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:16.760]   We've seen this where employees of some of these companies, Google included but especially
[00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:21.040]   Facebook, have morale is down a little bit because of things that their company has done.
[00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:24.360]   It's certainly the case with Facebook.
[00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:26.040]   How do you hit them where they live?
[00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:31.200]   When you're a Facebook employee and some jerk in some group that is doing market research
[00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:34.640]   or spying or whatever you want to call it and got kicked out of the app store and decided
[00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:39.920]   to use the enterprise certificate, they have caused you to not get your lunch or miss your
[00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:45.000]   bus or the app that you're testing stopped working for a couple of days.
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:48.080]   Wouldn't you be frustrated at the bad actors within your company?
[00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:52.680]   I think that's part of what Apple's doing here is trying to get some people at Facebook
[00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:57.960]   to be mad about because I think Facebook obviously has this very laissez-faire attitude of like
[00:50:57.960 --> 00:51:00.920]   well you know enterprise certificate, use it for whatever instead of saying you guys
[00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:05.040]   can't screw up our enterprise certificate with your market research and somebody didn't
[00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:07.240]   tell them no and now everybody knows it.
[00:51:07.240 --> 00:51:10.520]   That certificate was used for internal taste testing of the Facebook app and Instagram
[00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:11.520]   and it all broke.
[00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:12.520]   And all of that stuff is two things.
[00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:17.080]   So if I'm a developer of one of those apps, I would be mad at those people within Facebook
[00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:18.560]   and the people who enabled them.
[00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:25.440]   Let me remember again that these companies are sprawling, you know, they're not a monolith.
[00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:30.080]   It's not like that Mark decided that he wanted to have this app activated in.
[00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:31.920]   You know, it was some group that did that.
[00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:33.280]   It probably didn't even get up that high.
[00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:35.320]   It was someone who just worked, you know, they're trying to get something done.
[00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:36.680]   Oh, I'm guessing this got up that high.
[00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:37.680]   Oh, got that up when it went.
[00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:42.120]   I bet that Mark said we really need to figure out what the kids are using and that we need
[00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:43.440]   to make an initiative to do this.
[00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:44.440]   That sounds like something.
[00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:45.440]   Maybe.
[00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:46.920]   That's got to be from the top.
[00:51:46.920 --> 00:51:51.840]   No, Mark, the market research is not a stupid thing to do although it's a weasily way to
[00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:53.320]   do it with the VPN.
[00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:57.680]   I think it's that we's the novel was weasily because it didn't say it's a Facebook research
[00:51:57.680 --> 00:51:59.160]   app, but this isn't weasily.
[00:51:59.160 --> 00:52:00.160]   This is very upfront.
[00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:01.280]   We want to know what you're up to.
[00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:05.240]   If you want 20 bucks a month, just it's just that on iOS, they couldn't do it without violating
[00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:09.920]   Apple's terms and they decided they decided they didn't care and when that's a big point
[00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:13.280]   and when they asked the kids about it, you know, there's there was an interview, I think
[00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:15.840]   on NPR where they were asking all these kids and the kids were like, well, they're looking
[00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:16.840]   at all of our data anyway.
[00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:20.280]   Like they were like, we figured we'd get 20, 20 bucks of gifts for them.
[00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:23.000]   The kids, it wasn't like the kids felt like they were wronged.
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:25.920]   They were just kind of like, man, you know, the people are looking at everything we do
[00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:26.920]   all the time.
[00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:27.920]   It doesn't matter.
[00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:32.680]   It's really Apple's get it wrong here, but Apple's doing, I think the right thing in sending
[00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:37.520]   a signal to both Google and Facebook, you've got to adhere to our privacy policy.
[00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:38.520]   Right.
[00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:42.320]   And the fact that both these apps are still in the app store on on on Android is very
[00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:43.720]   telling.
[00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:47.920]   And I think this privacy, I mean, obviously this privacy war is going to continue both
[00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:51.360]   from the government trying to get in Apple trying to, you know, close it up.
[00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:55.360]   These guys trying to people trying to maintain control over data or keep that data going
[00:52:55.360 --> 00:52:59.400]   because there's just, you know, the whole internet runs on our data.
[00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:04.040]   So there's a lot, there's a lot of app developers who assumed that Apple wouldn't do anything
[00:53:04.040 --> 00:53:11.600]   here because they feel very much like small developers get the letter of the law, you
[00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:16.200]   know, used to kick them out of the store from stupid reasons and then they have to appeal
[00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:18.320]   and that big developers do all sorts of things.
[00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:19.600]   In a way, that's the case.
[00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:24.360]   If this had been an individual developer, if Mark Gorman had done this, it would be Bob
[00:53:24.360 --> 00:53:25.360]   I kid.
[00:53:25.360 --> 00:53:26.760]   The entire, all the apps would disappear from the apps.
[00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:27.920]   Or yeah, I think so.
[00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:31.960]   But I disagreed when my friends were like, Oh, they're not going to do anything because,
[00:53:31.960 --> 00:53:37.240]   first off, politically, like when will there be a better time to be seen as being in opposition
[00:53:37.240 --> 00:53:38.240]   to Facebook?
[00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:39.640]   When would there be a better time?
[00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:42.040]   This is Facebook is on the outs here.
[00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:44.760]   This is going to make you look good to do this.
[00:53:44.760 --> 00:53:47.920]   And yeah, it can be a slap on the wrist, which is what it is.
[00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:49.480]   And Facebook's going to have to take their lumps.
[00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:50.480]   They're really good at it.
[00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:53.320]   They've been taking their lumps the last two years.
[00:53:53.320 --> 00:53:57.040]   It just turns out moving fast and breaking things eventually catches up.
[00:53:57.040 --> 00:54:00.280]   You know, I think that's the, that's the hard part that Facebook has to, you know, work
[00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:04.920]   through is that, you know, just going to some ways, Apple's book, Apple and my Pixel, because
[00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:06.720]   I thought 20 bucks a month.
[00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:07.720]   Yeah.
[00:54:07.720 --> 00:54:12.840]   Well, in some ways, I mean, I think the, the, the hard part is is that in some, sometimes
[00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:17.920]   you feel like Apple moves so slowly to be careful that it's like, you know, it's, it's,
[00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:22.000]   this monolithic, you know, process, but at the same time, who would you rather be with?
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:23.000]   Well, yeah, exactly.
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:27.000]   It's just stability, you know, versus, you know, sometimes versus innovation.
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:31.240]   Well, yeah, we're not going to get 5G on an iPhone until after many Android phones have
[00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:32.240]   it presumably, right?
[00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:33.240]   Right.
[00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:37.000]   Well, and, and even like when we get back to the group calling, Apple, you know, is, is
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:40.440]   going to eventually release group calling for all of us to use, but it's not something
[00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:42.440]   Google's been doing that for a long time.
[00:54:42.440 --> 00:54:45.640]   You know, and, and, but there was, you know, there was a lot of lumps in, in, in the,
[00:54:45.640 --> 00:54:51.960]   there's a lot of arrows in the back of the, of the, you know, it out in the front there.
[00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:54.760]   Okay, let's talk about glass panel keyboards.
[00:54:54.760 --> 00:54:58.960]   Then we'll take a break and we'll talk about quarterly results.
[00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:01.280]   Jason will illustrate in color.
[00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:02.280]   Oh boy.
[00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:03.280]   Oh boy.
[00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:04.280]   In color.
[00:55:04.280 --> 00:55:08.880]   This is a report from Mac Rumor's Apple's exploring a new keyboard design to rep.
[00:55:08.880 --> 00:55:09.880]   I hope they are.
[00:55:09.880 --> 00:55:10.880]   Patents.
[00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:11.880]   This is patents though, right?
[00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:12.880]   Yeah.
[00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:13.880]   So what's the reality of it?
[00:55:13.880 --> 00:55:20.000]   Last year we saw a patent where Apple said, what if the touch bar was the entire keyboard?
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:21.000]   And this patent is okay.
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:23.680]   What if the touch bar was not the entire keyboard?
[00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:26.480]   But what if we still made it like a gas glass panel?
[00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:29.480]   My podcast co-host Mike Hurley made the joke yesterday.
[00:55:29.480 --> 00:55:32.080]   It's like, oh, you don't like dust in your keyboards, huh?
[00:55:32.080 --> 00:55:34.320]   What if there was no keyboard?
[00:55:34.320 --> 00:55:36.080]   It's the, it's the, what is it?
[00:55:36.080 --> 00:55:38.880]   It's the conduction stove top of keyboards.
[00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:39.880]   Yeah.
[00:55:39.880 --> 00:55:43.880]   The idea here is that it's got, it's got, it's a glass panel, but it's, you can, you
[00:55:43.880 --> 00:55:46.760]   can feel the keys and they might actually move a little bit.
[00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:48.680]   Molded in the shape of a keyboard.
[00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:49.680]   Yeah.
[00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:50.680]   Yeah.
[00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:54.040]   It's Andy and I'm waiting for the picture of Andy's face horrified.
[00:55:54.040 --> 00:55:56.760]   Well, you can plot Apple's history with keyboards, right?
[00:55:56.760 --> 00:56:01.440]   Like, and this is the scary part is the question, all the controversy about the Mac book keyboard,
[00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:05.840]   the question is, did Apple look at that and say, oh, we went too far?
[00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:08.440]   Or did Apple say, aha, we did not go far enough?
[00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:11.600]   Or did they decide a long time ago that they were going to this place and they just kept
[00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:15.240]   on making the keys thinner and thinner and thinner to train us on?
[00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:16.640]   It could be, right?
[00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:19.360]   So that's, that's, for me, that's the question because I have no doubt there are people in
[00:56:19.360 --> 00:56:23.960]   Apple are like, how can we reinvent the keyboard and eliminate travel and make it this completely
[00:56:23.960 --> 00:56:24.960]   new thing?
[00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:27.680]   I have to admit, I'm fooled by my trackpad every time.
[00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:28.680]   It's not moving.
[00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:31.880]   It feels like it's moving because of the, of the haptic engine.
[00:56:31.880 --> 00:56:33.440]   Could you do that with keys?
[00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:34.440]   Possibly.
[00:56:34.440 --> 00:56:37.200]   I might feel I know Andy and I won't be happy, but.
[00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:38.360]   And I won't be happy either.
[00:56:38.360 --> 00:56:39.360]   Oh, you like a real click keyboard.
[00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:41.360]   Oh, yeah, I like a real clicky keyboard.
[00:56:41.360 --> 00:56:45.520]   Yeah, my home keyboard is as much movement as possible.
[00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:49.520]   And I do think that the lack of reliability in the Mac book keyboard where a lot of people
[00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:55.080]   complain about dust getting in and all that is competing with the lack of travel that
[00:56:55.080 --> 00:56:56.920]   is traditional in keyboards.
[00:56:56.920 --> 00:57:00.720]   And the question also is, does Apple not care about the one, but cares a lot about the other?
[00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:01.720]   It's my sense.
[00:57:01.720 --> 00:57:05.840]   Maybe I'm wrong and I don't talk to enough people, but that most people surprisingly,
[00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:10.600]   like my wife don't mind the lack of travel, but everybody who has a stuck key is going
[00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:11.600]   to mind that.
[00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:12.600]   Right.
[00:57:12.600 --> 00:57:15.240]   Well, and I think that may be the truth is that we may complain about the lack of travel.
[00:57:15.240 --> 00:57:16.600]   We're your all writers.
[00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:17.600]   You're all banging.
[00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:18.600]   Exactly.
[00:57:18.600 --> 00:57:20.160]   We it's our, it's our, it's our instrument.
[00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:22.840]   Also also defined as people who use keyboards.
[00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:25.240]   Well, I don't like it.
[00:57:25.240 --> 00:57:26.240]   I don't like it.
[00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:31.440]   I don't, I don't think that I have never, I shouldn't say never, but I have very, very
[00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:37.320]   rarely talk to somebody who said that, who said that I just, I just switched the new
[00:57:37.320 --> 00:57:41.520]   MacBook and boy, that new keyboard is much better than the old one.
[00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:45.560]   If you give me the opportunity to buy a MacBook that had the old keyboard, did it?
[00:57:45.560 --> 00:57:49.520]   I would say no, because I love this new one so much.
[00:57:49.520 --> 00:57:52.200]   It's always, it's better than I thought it would be.
[00:57:52.200 --> 00:57:57.600]   I guess I can live with it or the stuff that I'm getting with the new, my new 20, 2018
[00:57:57.600 --> 00:58:01.480]   MacBook Pro is worth giving up a more comfortable keyboard.
[00:58:01.480 --> 00:58:06.120]   Really, and Jason makes a, of course, the, the critical point that this is just a patent,
[00:58:06.120 --> 00:58:10.120]   but I'm, I'm amazed that they're even continuing to go down this path.
[00:58:10.120 --> 00:58:15.320]   This is definitely the wily coyote of human interface engineering that if you just keep
[00:58:15.320 --> 00:58:20.200]   failing and failing and failing, just fix all the things that you keep failing at until
[00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:24.320]   this is one big 10 layer burrito of fail.
[00:58:24.320 --> 00:58:27.560]   Or you could just simply say, now let's see.
[00:58:27.560 --> 00:58:33.800]   The problem here, let's go on the whiteboard, is that we want a keyboard that feels natural,
[00:58:33.800 --> 00:58:39.960]   doesn't get broken, has a, has, resist us against dust.
[00:58:39.960 --> 00:58:45.320]   It looks like we're actually looking at the keyboard we had the first time four years
[00:58:45.320 --> 00:58:46.320]   ago.
[00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:48.520]   Yeah, I like it.
[00:58:48.520 --> 00:58:54.280]   I mean, it's, I honestly, the current keyboard is, is a pile of garbage as far as I'm concerned.
[00:58:54.280 --> 00:58:57.680]   It does, it doesn't add any features that affect consumers.
[00:58:57.680 --> 00:58:59.320]   It's all for Apple.
[00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:02.400]   And so, but I'm just saying, one of the most guys choices.
[00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:05.880]   Using iPad Pros with Apple's keyboard, which is not the greatest.
[00:59:05.880 --> 00:59:09.200]   I would prefer this to the MacBook keyboard by far.
[00:59:09.200 --> 00:59:10.200]   Wow.
[00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:14.040]   But the, I like the idea that Apple and other tech companies say, you know, let's not just
[00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:16.680]   accept that the current, whatever is good enough.
[00:59:16.680 --> 00:59:18.480]   Let's, what, could we reinvent this?
[00:59:18.480 --> 00:59:21.120]   Could we make a better mouse trap here?
[00:59:21.120 --> 00:59:23.280]   And Apple clearly is trying that with the keyboard.
[00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:26.960]   The problem is, do they start believing their own PR and they're like, no, no, we've really
[00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:27.960]   reinvented the keyboard.
[00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:33.000]   And I think it's exacerbated by the fact that on a PC laptop, if you don't like the
[00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:36.920]   keyboard on one company's laptop, you can buy a different company's laptops.
[00:59:36.920 --> 00:59:42.200]   On MacBooks, there's only one manufacturer and there's only one keyboard now.
[00:59:42.200 --> 00:59:46.400]   There's only one keyboard, which means it really has to have broad appeal.
[00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:51.400]   And I, I do hear, I, Andy, I do know people who like this keyboard or at least professed
[00:59:51.400 --> 00:59:52.400]   to like it.
[00:59:52.400 --> 00:59:56.920]   But I also know a lot of people who hate it and polarizing is not what you want in the
[00:59:56.920 --> 01:00:01.680]   only keyboard that is purchaseable for an entire laptop line.
[01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:03.760]   And that's why I just think it's incredible.
[01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:09.440]   You can't even buy an external keyboard made by Apple that doesn't have this cockamangy,
[01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:11.000]   super flat design.
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:15.400]   And it's like, that's where, that's where every joke that we've had to suffer since
[01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:21.040]   day one as Mac users, but you know, Apple, Apple, they're all about style over substance.
[01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:22.600]   We said, no, it's not the Macintosh.
[01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:25.640]   It looks stylish, but it's also a very powerful computer.
[01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:30.160]   But it comes down to, again, an external keyboard that can be as big as anybody wants
[01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:31.160]   it.
[01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:35.240]   You don't have to put these, these crappy flat keys on it, but Apple decided to put these
[01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:37.800]   same crappy flat keys on it.
[01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:39.200]   That's style over substance.
[01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:42.400]   That's everything that we've been making fun of for 10 years.
[01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:43.400]   Yeah.
[01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:49.040]   Well, and I, I do think as a creative professional, what those keys mean to us changes every
[01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:50.960]   app that we jump into.
[01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:56.200]   And I can see that as a, you know, I would be interested in something not as my, what I
[01:00:56.200 --> 01:01:02.680]   write in, but as a, as if I'm jumping from editing to 3D to, to something else, having
[01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:04.960]   those keys actually change their display.
[01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:08.400]   Rather than, you know, a lot of us have had those little rubber things that you put over
[01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:12.840]   top of your keyboard that is like now your final cut keyboard or cinema 4D keyboard or
[01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:14.680]   your illustrator keyboard.
[01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:18.760]   But imagine them all changing that entire interface, changing every single time.
[01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:22.360]   And if you got rid of the ridges of the keys, I could see an argument of, well, I could
[01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:23.400]   just change the whole interface.
[01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:28.160]   Like I'm touching thing, you know, I have like, I have little virtual dials or I have,
[01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:31.560]   you know, something like that all, that all kind of become part of that.
[01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:36.360]   I know that one of the things that we've built is stuff that integrates with two different
[01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:37.360]   touch screens.
[01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:41.120]   So you're one screen controlling the other screen and you're able to design that interface
[01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:42.240]   and it with a lot more freedom.
[01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:46.960]   I'm not saying that that's what I want for my day to day laptop, but I can see how a conversation
[01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:50.320]   around that could generate this idea of moving to a glass top.
[01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:52.160]   See, that's the difference that I'm talking about.
[01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:56.720]   If you decided to Intel's been trying to get manufacturers interested in that kind of
[01:01:56.720 --> 01:02:00.880]   a thing where you have two glass, a notebook that's two glass panels, one of which can
[01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:04.920]   be a keyboard when it needs to be the other or could be just another touch surface if
[01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:05.920]   you need it to be.
[01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:10.960]   At least you're saying that, yes, we're taking away from you this beautiful natural field
[01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:14.960]   mechanical keyboard, but we're also saying that when you're gaming, you can actually
[01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:19.160]   have a game controller there or you can have a jog shuttle or you can actually when you
[01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:23.080]   want to read a comic book, you can have two pages of a book in front of you when you open
[01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:24.840]   it this way.
[01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:29.040]   What I always get kind of what I think is a hard and fast rule is that if you take something
[01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:36.400]   away from me as a hardware manufacturer, you have to give me something back in its place.
[01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:39.760]   And if you're telling if the answer to the question, why did you make this change is
[01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:44.920]   that because we think stylishly it looks better or because that allows us to save them any
[01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:50.600]   factoring step and you're not making it cheaper for me to buy in return, that is not that
[01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:53.080]   that's that don't make me solve an Apple problem.
[01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:54.520]   That sounds like an Apple problem.
[01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:57.280]   You solve it and you give me a real keyboard.
[01:02:57.280 --> 01:03:01.440]   You don't make me have to suffer because you don't want to make your your baseboard
[01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:06.760]   two millimeters thicker or you don't want to figure out a way to put a really good keyboard
[01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:10.920]   in the same space and to and to what Jason said again.
[01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:16.800]   I have to I had a had a little bit of a scare a couple of months ago where there was a possibility
[01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:19.440]   that my Macbook Pro my 2015 was broken.
[01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:26.280]   I thought I knew it was just a similar a storage module that could just swap in and be good.
[01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:30.640]   But if it didn't if that didn't fix the problem, I was going to be screwed because there's
[01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:32.840]   no way I could buy a new Macbook.
[01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:37.560]   Whereas and I knew exactly which model of Windows 10 notebook I would probably have
[01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:43.000]   to swap it with in addition to buying a new couple of Mac minis around the house to replace
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:48.120]   the function of the of the Macbook Pro because instead of one machine that can do it all
[01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:51.440]   for me, which would be the Macbook Pro, the fact that this is a terrible keyboard that
[01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:58.760]   I don't like meant that I could switch over to Lenovo Carbon X1 which has a magnificent
[01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:03.840]   keyboard that Apple hasn't been as good as for more than five years.
[01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:08.440]   I don't think these are choices that Apple would be making if they were actually competing
[01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:14.080]   for consumers when they know that the if you have the it's not are we making a keyboard
[01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:16.200]   as good as the one we're replacing.
[01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:20.760]   It's a it's a question of I know it's not as nice as the one that we're replacing, but
[01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:24.280]   is it so bad that someone's going to switch from Mac to Windows, but I think it's more
[01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:25.280]   than just switching.
[01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:27.800]   It's also I mean the same problem they're having with the phone is just upgrades, you
[01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:32.400]   know, and so the you know how fast we upgrade like I haven't I'm still hanging on to my
[01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:36.280]   2015 because I'm really I really want my MagSafe.
[01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:40.560]   And it's not an inserting something into the into the USB C is not enough.
[01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:44.640]   I travel a lot and I and I and I use that the MagSafe was is the thing.
[01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:48.800]   All the other stuff doesn't matter to me, but the MagSafe was like where the line was
[01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:53.320]   and I haven't upgraded yet and and and I think that but that costs the money when I don't
[01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:58.640]   you know when I have you know I have 40 laptops you know in within the company you know it's
[01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:03.200]   not it's not like a you know us deciding we're not upgrading is is not a trivial you know
[01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:07.320]   number when it comes to that you know and and you know because we just don't want to
[01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:09.040]   we don't want to give that up.
[01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:13.240]   I still use the keyboard you recommended Andy years ago, dust keyboard.
[01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:19.320]   That's what I have my on my I'm Mac Pro and on my other Macs I'm using these code keyboards
[01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:26.120]   from WAST, which I really like and now I know they've added some colored key combinations
[01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:31.880]   which I'm now I'm thinking I'm I'm envious of Jason's little mini keyboard has color
[01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:36.680]   accommodation is that a code what is that I like the clicky Leopold but the clicky
[01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:39.880]   keyboard clicky oh it's it's probably cherry switches.
[01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:40.880]   We'll talk about that.
[01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:43.600]   It's a cherry brown.
[01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:47.680]   We even can talk about the cherry colors but it's funny that this iPad keyboard is using
[01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:50.200]   butterflies butterfly switches.
[01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:51.200]   Why do you like it more?
[01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:56.100]   It is it has a different feel more travel or is I think it's not I but it it does
[01:05:56.100 --> 01:06:02.080]   doesn't have it I build a 20 page document on in pages with this I don't love it.
[01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:07.000]   To me it doesn't have the dead stop that the laptop keyboards have.
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.400]   It's got a little more give when you spring to it.
[01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:10.400]   Yeah.
[01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:11.400]   Yeah.
[01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:15.320]   I mean everybody's back book here the new Mac 2018 Mac book here is to me just enough above
[01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:16.480]   acceptable that I can use.
[01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:21.000]   I think their third take it is keyboard is definitely better than the first two.
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:26.460]   Again I keep coming back to the fact that apples the solo vendor in its market and as
[01:06:26.460 --> 01:06:28.860]   a result you need to make a keyboard that's not polarizing.
[01:06:28.860 --> 01:06:32.260]   It's got to be crowd pleasing everybody's got to find it okay and what they did is they
[01:06:32.260 --> 01:06:36.580]   made a keyboard that I think a third of the people like a third of the people don't care
[01:06:36.580 --> 01:06:39.980]   and a third of the people hate and that's a problem because a third of your market can't
[01:06:39.980 --> 01:06:42.140]   buy a laptop keyboard.
[01:06:42.140 --> 01:06:46.980]   Well and most likely that third of the market is are the power users that are really connected
[01:06:46.980 --> 01:06:47.980]   to you more than anyone else.
[01:06:47.980 --> 01:06:50.820]   Because we all have opinions about keyboards right that's why they make a billion different
[01:06:50.820 --> 01:06:55.800]   keyboards the problem is Apple is the single vendor and they got you got to get the Mac
[01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:59.800]   book keyboard right and it has to be right for as many people as possible acceptable
[01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:01.720]   for as many people as possible.
[01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:05.580]   And sometimes I wonder how important it is to them because I know that my behavior at
[01:07:05.580 --> 01:07:17.560]   this point is that I go home and I work on my iMac and then I take my iPad pro around
[01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:22.060]   and I open up my laptop when there's just something weird that I can't quite can I haven't figured
[01:07:22.060 --> 01:07:24.280]   out how to connect to my iPad but that's about it.
[01:07:24.280 --> 01:07:27.860]   I mean it's just like a compatibility with some file or I have to open up you know do
[01:07:27.860 --> 01:07:33.220]   this thing or I have to do a quick edit with final cut but you know I think that you know
[01:07:33.220 --> 01:07:36.260]   and I don't know whether Apple looks at that as a trend or not but you know to me there's
[01:07:36.260 --> 01:07:40.720]   my work at home and then there's my iPad for literally 95% of my time that I'm outside
[01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:42.840]   of my house.
[01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:49.420]   I did somebody's reminding me I bought an ancient antique IBM model M keyboard.
[01:07:49.420 --> 01:07:54.300]   I haven't used it on anything yet I have it very loud.
[01:07:54.300 --> 01:07:58.380]   It's really feels good but I just haven't found the right place to use it.
[01:07:58.380 --> 01:08:01.100]   The only sensitivity I have with my clickety-clack is when I'm on a conference call.
[01:08:01.100 --> 01:08:03.500]   Oh you can't use it and I can use them on the air.
[01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:04.500]   Exactly.
[01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:09.100]   Because it's too it sounds like I'm like booking air while the reservation is in between
[01:08:09.100 --> 01:08:10.700]   calls or something.
[01:08:10.700 --> 01:08:11.700]   Yeah.
[01:08:11.700 --> 01:08:13.160]   Alright let's take a little break.
[01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:20.520]   Six colors coming up and we'll show you the one thing that Jason Snell could not do on
[01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:21.520]   his iPad.
[01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:24.640]   That's an esoteric one but sure I like it.
[01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:26.840]   It's actually the main reason I use BB edit.
[01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:27.840]   Alright.
[01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:28.840]   It's the main reason.
[01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:31.560]   Our show today brought to you by Atlassian.
[01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:33.160]   I'll tell you the reason we use Atlassian.
[01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:34.760]   We are in Atlassian house.
[01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:40.640]   We love Atlassian here at Twit and we use it because it's a collaboration a set of collaboration
[01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:49.160]   tools that help our team work together but also stay connected to us and other members
[01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:51.660]   of the team document what they do.
[01:08:51.660 --> 01:08:57.240]   It all starts and everybody who's ever developed knows if you're an agile developer you certainly
[01:08:57.240 --> 01:09:00.140]   know Atlassian's JIRA.
[01:09:00.140 --> 01:09:06.000]   That's probably how you know Atlassian but do you know they have many other tools not
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.480]   just for developers.
[01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:13.760]   Atlassian offers an affordable reliable set of tools for teams of all sizes in many areas
[01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:19.800]   of the enterprise from dev ops to agile from IT apps to ops to ITSM and whatever is next.
[01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:25.640]   For instance we use JIRA kind of to keep track of issues and their resolution and who's
[01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:26.920]   responsible for it and all that.
[01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:28.160]   It's very good for that.
[01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:32.840]   We use confluence though with JIRA to document changes document workflow.
[01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:34.000]   That's really important.
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:35.040]   JIRA ops.
[01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:37.520]   This is something relatively new.
[01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:42.640]   Ops Genie and Status Page that helps you detect incidents coordinate response efforts to resolve
[01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:46.000]   issues faster to keep customers or stakeholders updated.
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:50.920]   If you've got a code base you sure know about Bitbucket and if you don't you better go find
[01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:51.920]   out about it.
[01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:58.520]   Atlassian forms the backbone of effective cross team project planning, organization and communication
[01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:01.920]   and your teams love using it.
[01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:05.280]   They can choose the tools that's right for their current framework while trusting that
[01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:10.000]   as you grow Atlassian will grow with you and of course it all integrates with JIRA and
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:14.160]   confluence so that way you don't have to move from platform to platform.
[01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:17.440]   Look at the companies the best IT teams in the world that use Atlassian.
[01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:18.760]   We love Atlassian.
[01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:23.280]   You will love Atlassian and the nice thing is you can try Atlassian because all of their
[01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:31.720]   apps are easy and free to try at Atlassian.com/IT.
[01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:39.040]   Find the tools that are right for your team at Atlassian.com/IT.
[01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:44.760]   This made my heart just to go pit a pat when I saw this on sixcolors.com.
[01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:47.560]   BB edits, very fancy grip.
[01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:49.000]   Let's talk about regular expressions.
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:50.000]   People love that.
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:53.720]   This is -- so I put together the sixcolors report card where I talked to 55 different
[01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:56.560]   people about how Apple did in 2018.
[01:10:56.560 --> 01:10:59.680]   I had this moment where I realized I had to go back to my Mac to finish it even though
[01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:02.160]   I was working on my iPad because I do a lot of work on my iPad.
[01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:03.760]   What was it that the iPad couldn't do?
[01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:05.240]   Because you do most of it on the iPad.
[01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:13.240]   So there are some settings numbers as -- has some features especially in editing chart formatting
[01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:15.720]   that you just can't do on the iPad version.
[01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:18.240]   You have to do it only on the Mac version.
[01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:22.480]   I didn't realize that and I added a new data set and I realized I want to turn this circle
[01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:25.760]   into a triangle or whatever and it's like, "Nope, go back to your Mac for that."
[01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:29.800]   Also fonts, there are ways to install custom fonts on iPads.
[01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:31.480]   You can use third-party apps to do it.
[01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:34.200]   They get installed as like a font certificate.
[01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:35.360]   It's super weird.
[01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:36.360]   You can do it.
[01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:41.960]   But I didn't have them installed and I had changed the font to my logo font and I realized
[01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:43.160]   I didn't have it on my iPad.
[01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:47.480]   So I had to take all of the screenshots on my Mac.
[01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:50.400]   Then the big one was I had to do a lot of text processing.
[01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:55.840]   So I needed to flip around the attribution in my story because somebody pointed out I
[01:11:55.840 --> 01:11:59.400]   was quoting people with their name at the end and then quoting somebody else with their
[01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:02.240]   name at the end and people were getting confused about who said what.
[01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:06.240]   And I wrote a little regular expression that just flipped it around so that it quoted them
[01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:08.200]   with their name at the beginning.
[01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:09.200]   And --
[01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:10.200]   Tell me the truth.
[01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:12.680]   Did you have to go to your regular expression reference?
[01:12:12.680 --> 01:12:13.680]   I didn't.
[01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:14.680]   You knew how to do that.
[01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:15.680]   I know how to do that one.
[01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:16.680]   That's impressive.
[01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:17.680]   And I was very educated.
[01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:19.480]   But there are apps that will do this on iOS.
[01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:24.440]   But I didn't have them and my text editors of choice on iOS don't have that feature.
[01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:29.000]   And then the one that really got me is BB Edda has this sort lines command where I was able
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:33.840]   to -- I had a list of 55 names and I needed to be an alphabetical order by last name.
[01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:39.280]   And I was able to do that in BB Edda with the sort lines command in like five seconds.
[01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:41.120]   And I -- for the life of me couldn't figure out how to do that.
[01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:42.800]   I still need BB Edda.
[01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:48.120]   And I have to say I keep that grep box checked all the time in my fine and replace because
[01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:50.040]   regular expressions are so powerful.
[01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:51.040]   And you got to learn them.
[01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:52.040]   They look weird.
[01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:53.040]   You can't really check them until you learn them.
[01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:54.040]   But once you --
[01:12:54.040 --> 01:12:55.040]   Oh boy.
[01:12:55.040 --> 01:12:56.400]   It saves you so much time.
[01:12:56.400 --> 01:13:00.320]   I frequently have situations where I've -- you know, every year on Christmas card list
[01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:03.200]   I have to import it from a spreadsheet and munch it around.
[01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:04.200]   Yeah, exactly right.
[01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:05.100]   It looks like real addresses.
[01:13:05.100 --> 01:13:08.920]   And having those -- that grep tool makes so much -- so much of it.
[01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:14.440]   Because literally here I'm looking for a quote -- text and quotation marks followed by comma,
[01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:17.520]   close quote, said a name, period.
[01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:20.480]   And find that and then it grabs them and it flips them.
[01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:25.080]   And I was able to go through in about two minutes and completely redo the entire 5,000
[01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:26.080]   word story for the quotes.
[01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:27.080]   It was right.
[01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:30.760]   Now the only thing that would press me more is if you use said, awk and grep.
[01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:31.760]   The command line.
[01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:33.600]   Yeah, no, that's too far for me.
[01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:35.800]   That's why I have to be at it.
[01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:41.080]   You know, I used to know how to do this and said, but I have probably lost that since
[01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:42.080]   I had BB edit.
[01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:46.080]   You know, this is the fourth or fifth time we put up that graphic.
[01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:49.960]   For Jason, for the benefit of people who are just listening by podcasts, you want to read
[01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:52.600]   out what that grep is just so they don't feel it left out?
[01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:53.600]   Oh, yeah, sure.
[01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:56.840]   Well, it is a quote mark followed by -- what is it?
[01:13:56.840 --> 01:13:58.240]   Period, asterisk question mark.
[01:13:58.240 --> 01:13:59.240]   Parenthesis.
[01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:00.240]   You got to put those in parentheses.
[01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:02.040]   It is not human readable.
[01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:04.800]   And then bracket comma question mark back slash dot.
[01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:08.560]   Once you learn it, you look and you say, oh, it's going to grab a bunch of text that's
[01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:13.480]   in quotes followed by a period question mark or comma followed by a close quote.
[01:14:13.480 --> 01:14:17.200]   And then the word said followed by a bunch of letters and a period.
[01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:20.360]   Like you can -- once you learn it, you can recognize it.
[01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:22.400]   The question mark makes it lazy, right?
[01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:23.600]   So it doesn't have to happen.
[01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:26.920]   BB edit is free to try from barebones.com.
[01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:28.360]   It's got a pretty good documentation.
[01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:33.640]   And the BB edit manual has a great chapter on how to use pattern matching with grep that
[01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:36.120]   will teach you almost everything you need to know.
[01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:39.960]   So if people are curious about processing their text and saving time and learning this
[01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:44.680]   stuff, you can get BB edit for free to try it out and you can learn it from the name.
[01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:47.120]   So basically -- so you understand what's happening here.
[01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:49.560]   This is the quote is the first part.
[01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:52.440]   And this is the attribution is the second part.
[01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:53.920]   And what he does is he flips them.
[01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:56.080]   So backslash two is the second part.
[01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:57.520]   Or two said number one.
[01:14:57.520 --> 01:14:58.520]   And then that's that.
[01:14:58.520 --> 01:14:59.520]   And so he's just flipping it.
[01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:01.440]   I do a lot of that for things like, oh, I forgot.
[01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:04.240]   I want to put all of these names in boldface or something like that.
[01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:07.520]   And if you can -- if there's a pattern, all the names are at the beginning, followed by
[01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:11.800]   a colon, beginning of a paragraph, you can grab that and then put bold tags around it.
[01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:12.800]   It seems to be --
[01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:14.720]   It's not my skewer, but the ability to do this is really great.
[01:15:14.720 --> 01:15:17.360]   Not only that, but like it does seem obscure.
[01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:20.320]   And especially if you haven't done regular expressions before.
[01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:25.800]   But the thing is it might take you -- sometimes it might take me like 15 or 20 minutes to
[01:15:25.800 --> 01:15:27.880]   get the regular expression right.
[01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:33.400]   But that's balanced against what might have been like two hours on a long manuscript,
[01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:36.080]   making the exact same change one at a time.
[01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:40.400]   And I would much rather -- even if it were a half hour of getting the reg expert right,
[01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:45.320]   at least that is interesting intellectually stimulating work, whereas when you're just
[01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:49.160]   doing it one at a time, looking at search, replace, search, replace, search, replace,
[01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:52.000]   imagine you get so numb that you will miss so many of them.
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:55.680]   And you'll imagine going through this document, 5,000 word document, looking for every time
[01:15:55.680 --> 01:16:01.560]   somebody said, "said name," and then select it and cut it, and then select inside the
[01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:04.640]   end of the quote and put a period instead of a comma, and then move to the beginning
[01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:09.280]   of the quote and paste it and change where the set is and put another comma.
[01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:14.400]   And also, not only is that super boring and you don't want to do that, you will make mistakes.
[01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:16.000]   You will introduce mistakes.
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:17.280]   And it's just a waste of time.
[01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:21.560]   So once you learn pattern matching and grab, it will save you time.
[01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:22.560]   It's the best.
[01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:23.720]   It does feel pretty old-fashioned.
[01:16:23.720 --> 01:16:24.720]   This --
[01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:30.200]   One of my favorite computer books of all time is Jeffrey Freels, Mastering Regular Expressions.
[01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:33.440]   The first edition was about a quarter-inch thick.
[01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:35.040]   I don't know if I have the second or third edition.
[01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:36.040]   I see you as a new edition.
[01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:40.160]   The one I have is about three inches thick, so suddenly he found a lot more to say about
[01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:41.160]   it.
[01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:45.440]   It is all on one subject, regular expressions.
[01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:48.000]   But if you know this, I don't know.
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000]   Pearl does it, Python does it, which is do it.
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:53.400]   Yeah, it's portable to just about anywhere you go.
[01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:54.400]   It's pretty.
[01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:58.960]   I know it's nerdy, but whenever we talk about on this show or on other tech podcasts about
[01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:02.480]   things like scripting and automation and stuff like that, there is a bar you have to
[01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:04.200]   clear and it's a little scary.
[01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:08.000]   But I'd say if you're watching this show, you're listening to this podcast.
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:13.320]   You might -- yeah, this is the stuff that you put in an hour's work and you have to find
[01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:15.720]   that hour, but you will get back like 50 hours.
[01:17:15.720 --> 01:17:19.800]   That's how I got into coding was -- I mean, admittedly it was --
[01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:20.800]   Rep?
[01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:22.440]   No, it was Dungeons & Dragons.
[01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:26.840]   I was tired of rolling all the dice for non-player characters because they get killed so quickly.
[01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:31.920]   So I just wrote a -- my first basic program was to generate the character from scratch.
[01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:34.960]   Like I hit a button and then it just printed out.
[01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:41.080]   And the -- but pretty much my whole programming and everything, even up until now when I use
[01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:45.320]   numbers to build stuff, it's I don't want to do this more than once.
[01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:48.880]   If I'm going to -- if I do anything that looks like I'm going to do it repeatedly, I'm going
[01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:51.080]   to figure out how to get something to do it for me.
[01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:52.080]   Right, right.
[01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:59.440]   So my first dive into Red Air was every time I had a comic book database and I needed to
[01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:00.960]   like change the output a little bit.
[01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:06.160]   I could either rebuild the entire database or I could just grip the text file, comma
[01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:11.400]   delimited whatever text file I had into what I needed it to be for whatever comic
[01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:13.960]   con I was going to next week.
[01:18:13.960 --> 01:18:19.520]   And it's just like you guys were all saying that it takes time to learn this, but you're
[01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:25.040]   not just -- when you do something manually, one hour of time is a total sunk and lost
[01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:26.440]   cost.
[01:18:26.440 --> 01:18:30.960]   When you spend one hour learning how to automate it, even if it would have taken you one hour,
[01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:35.280]   you've actually invested one hour's time into being able to do this in a half hour the next
[01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:37.520]   time and then 15 minutes the next time.
[01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:42.280]   And then as you -- as these techniques start to really take hold of your brain, now it's
[01:18:42.280 --> 01:18:45.800]   like 30 seconds and people wonder why you keep taking early lunches.
[01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:52.440]   I worked at a broadcast company and my first job was as an intern to do -- you won, you
[01:18:52.440 --> 01:18:56.560]   know, when we sent you a t-shirt, you know, like it was like, you -- everybody had done
[01:18:56.560 --> 01:18:59.840]   it for the last five years had typed that letter in.
[01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:05.760]   And you know, we had typed that letter to the -- and so the whole job, the whole internship
[01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:10.080]   job was to type those letters and to send those shirts.
[01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:14.880]   And I just figured out a whole mail merge to not only, you know, grab the names and print
[01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:17.520]   it out, but also print the label and everything else.
[01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:23.840]   And so I took a job that took, you know, six hours a day and got into about a half an hour
[01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:24.840]   that I did it.
[01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:27.840]   And then that allowed me to learn Photoshop because there was nothing else to do.
[01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:31.480]   You know, they literally had no idea what to do with me because I -- yeah.
[01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:35.000]   And I looked for things and then I finally -- I learned Photoshop.
[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:36.000]   I learned Quark.
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.720]   I learned Illustrator because there was nothing else to do with -- from my intern.
[01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:42.320]   I can't tell you how many nerds I know who have told me that same story, which is this
[01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:43.320]   job.
[01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:47.120]   And then you're like, "Hmm, let's all be the judge of that."
[01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:51.520]   And within a week you have -- I mean, the dark version of that is that they continue
[01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:55.280]   to pull down a paycheck for years doing one hour of work a week.
[01:19:55.280 --> 01:19:58.240]   But the nice version of that is they're like, "Guys, I'm an intern.
[01:19:58.240 --> 01:19:59.760]   I'm going to leave at the end of the summer.
[01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:00.760]   Here's a tool.
[01:20:00.760 --> 01:20:04.120]   You can do this without ever hiring another intern, I guess, or having them do something
[01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:05.320]   more useful with their time.
[01:20:05.320 --> 01:20:06.320]   It's great.
[01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:07.320]   I love it.
[01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:08.320]   I love it.
[01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:09.680]   I didn't know -- I've ruined the show, Leo.
[01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:11.160]   I've made it all about regular expressions.
[01:20:11.160 --> 01:20:12.560]   Oh, that didn't ruin it.
[01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:15.160]   As far as I'm concerned, that's a big improvement.
[01:20:15.160 --> 01:20:16.160]   But --
[01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:17.160]   That's a good idea.
[01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:18.160]   We have to move on.
[01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:19.160]   Oh, no.
[01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:20.160]   Alas.
[01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:24.320]   I want to -- I want to -- now let me see if I can find your six colors.
[01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:30.560]   Because the most recent article is about this and using the Mac and BB Edit to put out
[01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:32.160]   your report card.
[01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:33.160]   Where are your --
[01:20:33.160 --> 01:20:34.160]   Yeah, keep scrolling.
[01:20:34.160 --> 01:20:35.160]   Keep scrolling down and you'll get --
[01:20:35.160 --> 01:20:37.160]   You've got to pin them to the top.
[01:20:37.160 --> 01:20:38.160]   You've got to pin them to the top.
[01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:39.160]   It's blogs.
[01:20:39.160 --> 01:20:40.160]   It's blogs.
[01:20:40.160 --> 01:20:42.160]   Leo blogs work where you put them at the top.
[01:20:42.160 --> 01:20:44.160]   I always have to go through this.
[01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:45.160]   You're right.
[01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:46.160]   I should probably --
[01:20:46.160 --> 01:20:47.160]   I should --
[01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:48.160]   There it is.
[01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:49.160]   There it is.
[01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:50.160]   Yeah.
[01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:51.160]   By category.
[01:20:51.160 --> 01:20:55.160]   You've got iPhone 62% services 13%.
[01:20:55.160 --> 01:20:57.160]   That's telling, isn't it?
[01:20:57.160 --> 01:20:58.160]   Services are growing.
[01:20:58.160 --> 01:20:59.160]   iPhone is there.
[01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:01.560]   So this was the horrible quarter for Apple, right?
[01:21:01.560 --> 01:21:07.680]   The idea here is that they actually had to restate their earnings because it was a
[01:21:07.680 --> 01:21:08.960]   worse quarter for iPhone sales.
[01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:11.680]   They thought mostly because of China, although not entirely.
[01:21:11.680 --> 01:21:15.080]   It was still their second biggest revenue quarter of all time.
[01:21:15.080 --> 01:21:18.640]   But only their third biggest iPhone revenue quarter of all time, which tells you something
[01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:23.080]   that the rest of the business did really well and the iPhone kind of hit an air pocket
[01:21:23.080 --> 01:21:26.680]   and did poorly, did very poorly.
[01:21:26.680 --> 01:21:27.680]   Yeah.
[01:21:27.680 --> 01:21:30.640]   I mean, it's not $38.9 billion of revenue.
[01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:31.880]   That's the four quarter average.
[01:21:31.880 --> 01:21:32.880]   So you want the --
[01:21:32.880 --> 01:21:33.880]   Oh, that's the rolling average of that.
[01:21:33.880 --> 01:21:34.880]   You want the actual number.
[01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:35.880]   It's a quarterly number.
[01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:37.480]   Two billion dollars they made on iPhones, right?
[01:21:37.480 --> 01:21:38.480]   I wish I had that problem.
[01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:41.520]   And it's a 20 billion profit that quarter.
[01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:45.680]   Like, Apple does not need you to do a GoFundMe for them, right?
[01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:47.560]   It's not an issue.
[01:21:47.560 --> 01:21:49.680]   But it is -- this is the holiday quarter.
[01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:51.680]   It's the biggest quarter.
[01:21:51.680 --> 01:21:54.280]   iPhone sales or iPhone revenue was down.
[01:21:54.280 --> 01:21:55.280]   There's no doubt about it.
[01:21:55.280 --> 01:21:56.280]   And it's going to be --
[01:21:56.280 --> 01:21:57.280]   You notice how peaky this is.
[01:21:57.280 --> 01:21:59.080]   And each of these peaks is the big quarter.
[01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:00.280]   That's why I do that average.
[01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:01.280]   Yeah, that makes it --
[01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:02.280]   Because it takes out the seasonality.
[01:22:02.280 --> 01:22:07.280]   But if you draw a line going from each of the big quarters, you see that 52% of the
[01:22:07.280 --> 01:22:11.280]   iPhone C2 is actually worse than it's been for two big years.
[01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:12.280]   Right.
[01:22:12.280 --> 01:22:17.080]   Although interesting parallel is it did go down the year after the iPhone 6 came out.
[01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:20.720]   And I'm starting to feel like this is just something we all need to acknowledge, which
[01:22:20.720 --> 01:22:25.080]   is every three or four years, Apple comes out with a completely new phone sign.
[01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:26.080]   Yeah, this is an S-year.
[01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:27.080]   And there's a huge pin up demand.
[01:22:27.080 --> 01:22:28.080]   Yeah.
[01:22:28.080 --> 01:22:29.480]   And then the rest of the time, they kind of don't.
[01:22:29.480 --> 01:22:35.080]   Also, Apple said the two biggest selling phones last quarter were the 10R and the 10S Max,
[01:22:35.080 --> 01:22:36.080]   not the 10S.
[01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:37.680]   And what do those two phones have in common?
[01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:39.120]   They weren't for sale last year.
[01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:40.280]   They're new in a way.
[01:22:40.280 --> 01:22:43.520]   They are different in some way that maybe somebody's like, "Oh, I can see.
[01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:44.520]   I can get a bigger ten."
[01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:45.520]   The 10S is basically a 10.
[01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:49.520]   10S and the 10 are, you know, inside they're a little different, but they look exactly the
[01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:50.520]   same.
[01:22:50.520 --> 01:22:52.920]   And there are a lot of people who want something new.
[01:22:52.920 --> 01:22:56.240]   And Apple always talks about that as part of the Chinese market, and that's true.
[01:22:56.240 --> 01:22:59.760]   But I think it's true more generally like, "Oh, that phone is totally new."
[01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:01.760]   And last year, they had that with the 10.
[01:23:01.760 --> 01:23:03.680]   And this year, they don't have it as much.
[01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:08.440]   And so are we really surprised in an era where everybody's already got one and that the buying
[01:23:08.440 --> 01:23:13.040]   cycle is lengthening, that people would look at that phone and be like, "Yeah, whatever."
[01:23:13.040 --> 01:23:20.280]   It is telling that you had a 15% year over year drop in revenue.
[01:23:20.280 --> 01:23:25.280]   And I will say that the 10 was a stunning jump forward from the eight.
[01:23:25.280 --> 01:23:28.880]   You know, like the, you know, like, and that's the problem is is that I went up, I mean,
[01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:29.880]   I'm on the show.
[01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:32.680]   I mean, I got a new phone.
[01:23:32.680 --> 01:23:36.080]   If I wasn't on this show, I probably would not have bought a new phone.
[01:23:36.080 --> 01:23:38.400]   And I probably would have been just happy with my 10.
[01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:41.240]   I think that's the problem is it was such a, it's such a solid phone.
[01:23:41.240 --> 01:23:42.240]   Right.
[01:23:42.240 --> 01:23:45.240]   And so that makes it even more cyclical where like everybody rushed out who wanted a big
[01:23:45.240 --> 01:23:47.240]   iPhone and got that iPhone 6 Plus when it came out.
[01:23:47.240 --> 01:23:51.280]   They're like, "Oh my God, finally a big iPhone."
[01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:54.520]   But then it, that was it for a while, right?
[01:23:54.520 --> 01:23:56.640]   And the 10, I think there was a lot of pent up demand.
[01:23:56.640 --> 01:23:59.320]   Everybody was really excited about the 10, but it's also $1,000 phone.
[01:23:59.320 --> 01:24:01.800]   And the next year, you're like, "I don't need another $1,000 phone.
[01:24:01.800 --> 01:24:03.360]   It's pretty much the same."
[01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:07.640]   And the 10R, I think, did pretty well because it is different.
[01:24:07.640 --> 01:24:13.840]   And it makes me wonder if the long run strategy for Apple with iPhones is going to be to have
[01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:19.320]   the iPhone line kind of be a mix and have different ones kind of get different features
[01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:20.320]   year by year.
[01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:22.680]   So there's always something a little bit fresh and a little bit different.
[01:24:22.680 --> 01:24:24.760]   That would be smart if you want to sell more phones.
[01:24:24.760 --> 01:24:25.760]   What would you think?
[01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:27.920]   The problem is what do you add that you don't already have?
[01:24:27.920 --> 01:24:32.200]   Well, like the SE going away, I think there's an opportunity for them to do another kind
[01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:36.120]   of low end and/or small phone that doesn't currently exist in the product line.
[01:24:36.120 --> 01:24:37.120]   They could throw that in there.
[01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:38.120]   You could do three cameras.
[01:24:38.120 --> 01:24:41.920]   But the fact is, I mean, the fact is we don't live in the era where every year there's going
[01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:45.360]   to be a new smartphone that completely blows away all the smartphones of the year before.
[01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:51.560]   It's a much more boring, flat, incremental increase in smartphone tech.
[01:24:51.560 --> 01:24:54.160]   And that's just, that's where we are now.
[01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:58.160]   And all of us have to deal with it, all the phone makers have to deal with it.
[01:24:58.160 --> 01:25:03.120]   And what Apple gets, they lose all of that dramatic growth that Wall Street loved.
[01:25:03.120 --> 01:25:06.480]   What they get is this annuity, which is they're going to be making billions and billions of
[01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:09.240]   dollars on iPhones for the foreseeable future.
[01:25:09.240 --> 01:25:12.480]   And they can use that money to invest in whatever the next big thing is.
[01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:13.480]   Exactly.
[01:25:13.480 --> 01:25:18.640]   And they have a lock on the most profitable customer base, arguably in the world as a
[01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:19.640]   group.
[01:25:19.640 --> 01:25:22.680]   You know, like, so the thing is that there's an enormous amount of opportunity to continue
[01:25:22.680 --> 01:25:25.800]   to serve that market and make more money on it.
[01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:31.000]   You know, it's a, because those are the, that's the group that spends the most money.
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.920]   Services, of course, Tim Cook keeps pointing to services.
[01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:39.520]   And we're actually really what Apple wants the press to think about is revenue per customer.
[01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:42.360]   And services is a big part of how they keep that revenue up.
[01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:46.120]   Because if you have an iPhone, oh, they also mentioned installed base for the first time.
[01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:47.600]   They're really going to install this.
[01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:52.000]   They can't talk about sales numbers anymore because they stop reporting those.
[01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:53.880]   And they also don't want to because they look bad.
[01:25:53.880 --> 01:25:54.880]   It's not that they can't.
[01:25:54.880 --> 01:25:56.880]   But the install base looks good and continues to grow.
[01:25:56.880 --> 01:26:01.280]   900 million, 900 million iPhones, which, which means get ready for that press release
[01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:03.840]   in a year or two where they announce a billion iPhones and use.
[01:26:03.840 --> 01:26:04.840]   That's inactive use.
[01:26:04.840 --> 01:26:05.840]   Inactive use.
[01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:06.840]   Yeah.
[01:26:06.840 --> 01:26:11.320]   And Cook pointed out, or maybe it was Luca pointed out that we're seeing hand me downs
[01:26:11.320 --> 01:26:14.800]   that people buy a new iPhone, but they don't take the old one out of service.
[01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:15.960]   It gets handed down.
[01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:16.960]   My kids have my own ones.
[01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:17.960]   Yeah.
[01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:21.960]   And I think that's the, my kid has my 10 services up again.
[01:26:21.960 --> 01:26:24.840]   This is the four quarter average, not the quarterly average.
[01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:25.840]   That's a chart.
[01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:32.040]   I made a new chart that's going to debut later, which is the, which is that year over year
[01:26:32.040 --> 01:26:33.040]   growth for services.
[01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:36.800]   And it's hilarious because all of the others, you've got to plot it with the chart in the
[01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:39.600]   center because some quarters are down and some quarters are up.
[01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:41.280]   The services just goes up.
[01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:42.280]   You can start at zero.
[01:26:42.280 --> 01:26:43.280]   It just goes up.
[01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:44.680]   It keeps going up.
[01:26:44.680 --> 01:26:46.040]   It's a huge part of their business.
[01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:49.120]   It is now bigger than their Mac and iPad business.
[01:26:49.120 --> 01:26:50.680]   It's a very, that's a nice curve.
[01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:54.720]   And it's then it's moved out by the average, but like it just, they go up every single
[01:26:54.720 --> 01:26:56.560]   quarter and this is.
[01:26:56.560 --> 01:26:58.200]   10.4 billion for this year.
[01:26:58.200 --> 01:26:59.200]   This is part of their strategy.
[01:26:59.200 --> 01:27:03.720]   But I have to point out a good chunk of that comes from Google, right?
[01:27:03.720 --> 01:27:04.800]   I don't know what that counts.
[01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:05.800]   It counts in services.
[01:27:05.800 --> 01:27:06.800]   You mean the like the search revenue?
[01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:07.800]   It's Google.
[01:27:07.800 --> 01:27:08.800]   Google gives or then.
[01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:09.800]   I think it was.
[01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:11.440]   I think it was app store revenue, right?
[01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:14.000]   Because the app store is such a huge revenue generator.
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:15.960]   And then they give you know, you know, percent of it a bad.
[01:27:15.960 --> 01:27:19.040]   Looking at this and then, and then the claim was that Google last year gave them nine
[01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:22.400]   billion for the to be the default search engine in so far.
[01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:23.400]   Two billion.
[01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:24.800]   And this year was 12 billion.
[01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:25.800]   So it can't be in there.
[01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:27.440]   No, because this number is only 10.
[01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:29.800]   That is probably amortized across the product lines, right?
[01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:33.360]   That's probably goes into like it's part of the iPhone revenue or something like that.
[01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:36.640]   But yeah, still they made almost 11 million in in services.
[01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:37.640]   10.9 billion.
[01:27:37.640 --> 01:27:42.160]   And this is why they're going to come out with a video service this year and a news reading
[01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:46.800]   service this year and who knows what else they're going to do because they want to,
[01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:51.960]   you know, these valuable customers like Alex said, they want to be able to provide things
[01:27:51.960 --> 01:27:54.280]   that go beyond the hardware.
[01:27:54.280 --> 01:27:57.000]   And you know, that leads Apple into a pretty weird place.
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:02.760]   I think you could argue, but it also sort of is the nature of the tech industry today,
[01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:03.760]   I think.
[01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:07.960]   And we've never had, and this could be scary and it could be good, but we've never had
[01:28:07.960 --> 01:28:14.000]   one organization handling distribution for movies, music, print, all going through the
[01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:15.440]   same pipeline.
[01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:19.600]   The opportunities to intermingle those things.
[01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:28.360]   So having really interesting media rich products products in the texture platform that happened
[01:28:28.360 --> 01:28:33.800]   to tie into the movie platform that happened to tie into the to the radio podcast, radio
[01:28:33.800 --> 01:28:36.240]   platform, all of those things.
[01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:39.720]   No one's because it's always been disparate organizations that don't really understand
[01:28:39.720 --> 01:28:41.720]   what they're doing.
[01:28:41.720 --> 01:28:44.240]   They they just don't that doesn't happen.
[01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:47.280]   You know, they don't this the movie industry doesn't understand the print industry.
[01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:49.160]   The print industry doesn't understand the movie industry.
[01:28:49.160 --> 01:28:52.080]   You know, there's all this this bit this back and forth.
[01:28:52.080 --> 01:28:54.480]   And I think that there's going to be a really interesting opportunity where we start to see
[01:28:54.480 --> 01:28:59.840]   that tie in much tighter between those platforms where, you know, and I think that that's especially
[01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:03.240]   because next month we're going to hear about Apple's streaming service.
[01:29:03.240 --> 01:29:07.200]   Yeah, I think the services are getting so complex now that I am starting to believe that
[01:29:07.200 --> 01:29:13.240]   there will be some sort of bundle, some sort of Amazon Prime equivalent for Apple services.
[01:29:13.240 --> 01:29:15.120]   What would you include in that bundle?
[01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:18.080]   Oh, I mean, I think the the news service is a good example.
[01:29:18.080 --> 01:29:24.720]   The texture thing, which is magazines, news and magazines, Apple music, video, Apple music,
[01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:32.160]   iCloud, backups, storage, I think scary version is Apple doesn't change your Apple music.
[01:29:32.160 --> 01:29:36.960]   Apple music costs and they put the movies and the print into it.
[01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:41.360]   And that's that is the version that everyone would if it doesn't scare them to death.
[01:29:41.360 --> 01:29:42.360]   Google did that.
[01:29:42.360 --> 01:29:47.440]   That Google music, they just said, okay, we're going to throw in YouTube red.
[01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:50.240]   And now it's YouTube premium as part of your subscription.
[01:29:50.240 --> 01:29:52.560]   I think that's a smart strategy and I could see Apple do it.
[01:29:52.560 --> 01:29:54.600]   But adding the magazines and adding the other bits and pieces.
[01:29:54.600 --> 01:29:55.600]   That's a lot more.
[01:29:55.600 --> 01:30:02.440]   I think the challenge is Apple spending a billion dollars a year, probably on video content.
[01:30:02.440 --> 01:30:05.520]   They want that money back somewhere.
[01:30:05.520 --> 01:30:09.040]   And that's the question is like just adding it to Apple music and giving it free.
[01:30:09.040 --> 01:30:11.880]   It's not giving it for free.
[01:30:11.880 --> 01:30:13.760]   It is saying that we're going to have revenue.
[01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:15.480]   It's increasing the value of Apple music.
[01:30:15.480 --> 01:30:17.400]   You've got a lot of existing Apple music surprises.
[01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:19.160]   I just will see.
[01:30:19.160 --> 01:30:20.920]   I'm a little bit skeptical of that.
[01:30:20.920 --> 01:30:22.760]   It certainly would be simple to do it.
[01:30:22.760 --> 01:30:29.000]   A hundred million users paying, let's say ten bucks a month, is still a billion dollars
[01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:30.760]   a month of revenue.
[01:30:30.760 --> 01:30:36.080]   So, Prime can do this because they have a revenue generator kind of underneath it, which
[01:30:36.080 --> 01:30:39.200]   as long as you're a Prime member, you're going to buy more stuff from Amazon.
[01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:41.120]   So we're going to make more money.
[01:30:41.120 --> 01:30:46.600]   What could Apple do with a bundle that would give them incremental income on top of the
[01:30:46.600 --> 01:30:48.400]   services they're selling in the bundle?
[01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:53.840]   Maybe sell more iPads, iPhones, phones, Macs.
[01:30:53.840 --> 01:30:54.920]   I don't know.
[01:30:54.920 --> 01:30:57.840]   What's the underlying revenue growth there?
[01:30:57.840 --> 01:31:02.080]   I still think that Apple is in a perfect position to become a bank.
[01:31:02.080 --> 01:31:03.840]   No, I'm not going to get it.
[01:31:03.840 --> 01:31:04.840]   Apple Pay.
[01:31:04.840 --> 01:31:05.840]   Apple Pay is part of the services, right?
[01:31:05.840 --> 01:31:08.240]   That's the service that is the gift that keeps on giving.
[01:31:08.240 --> 01:31:13.320]   I now, anytime someone lets me do Apple Pay, I now use Apple Pay because I'm not going
[01:31:13.320 --> 01:31:16.200]   to change my credit card any time I want underneath it.
[01:31:16.200 --> 01:31:19.320]   But not just at merchants, but peer to peer Apple Pay.
[01:31:19.320 --> 01:31:20.320]   I give you money.
[01:31:20.320 --> 01:31:21.560]   I give you money.
[01:31:21.560 --> 01:31:22.560]   That is...
[01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:24.280]   Well, huge revenue opportunity.
[01:31:24.280 --> 01:31:28.760]   And if you look at a company that has that much cash, that could actually, the only reason
[01:31:28.760 --> 01:31:32.640]   they'd want to take your money for savings is to loan money to other people buying their
[01:31:32.640 --> 01:31:33.640]   products.
[01:31:33.640 --> 01:31:35.200]   It is a completely closed cycle.
[01:31:35.200 --> 01:31:36.200]   That's interesting.
[01:31:36.200 --> 01:31:40.280]   And Apple is the only company in the world that could do that.
[01:31:40.280 --> 01:31:45.360]   I think ultimately the story is going to be just that it is the Apple ecosystem.
[01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:47.760]   So we can simplify it for you.
[01:31:47.760 --> 01:31:48.760]   You pay us.
[01:31:48.760 --> 01:31:49.760]   You get everything.
[01:31:49.760 --> 01:31:50.760]   Just buy everything.
[01:31:50.760 --> 01:31:53.480]   What that means is that people who are right now kind of like, "Oh, pick and choose.
[01:31:53.480 --> 01:31:55.120]   I'll have Spotify over here."
[01:31:55.120 --> 01:31:58.480]   It's like, "No, you're just going to be all in on Apple."
[01:31:58.480 --> 01:32:01.840]   And that their advantage is going to be that people are not going to choose the competition
[01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:04.640]   because it's just a better deal to get it all from Apple.
[01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:06.960]   And they're already in there.
[01:32:06.960 --> 01:32:07.960]   Yeah.
[01:32:07.960 --> 01:32:11.400]   I mean, if you look at the number of people that use iPhones and then you look at how many
[01:32:11.400 --> 01:32:17.000]   it's, 38 million or 40 million B of A customers, Apple didn't have to play very hard.
[01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.120]   And people will say, "Well, they don't want to deal with regulations."
[01:32:19.120 --> 01:32:21.080]   Well, they're dealing with a lot of regulations for health.
[01:32:21.080 --> 01:32:24.360]   I mean, the health is more complicated than banking regulations.
[01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:28.320]   So they're not afraid of doing that because the reason you do some things is not because
[01:32:28.320 --> 01:32:32.840]   it's easy but because it's hard because it makes it very hard for everyone else to follow.
[01:32:32.840 --> 01:32:38.960]   When Apple has the wherewithal to weather that regulation storm in a way that other companies
[01:32:38.960 --> 01:32:40.160]   just wouldn't be able to do it.
[01:32:40.160 --> 01:32:45.000]   And I think that that health, banking, those are the reasons that you get really serious
[01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.880]   about privacy.
[01:32:47.880 --> 01:32:51.680]   I always look at Mac revenue because I'm just that kind of guy.
[01:32:51.680 --> 01:32:55.160]   And I have to say this is the biggest Mac, quarterly Mac revenue ever.
[01:32:55.160 --> 01:32:58.200]   It is the biggest Mac quarter ever in terms of overall revenue.
[01:32:58.200 --> 01:32:59.200]   That's mine, boggling.
[01:32:59.200 --> 01:33:04.480]   And Apple says that it's the most install base, I think, for iPad and Mac ever.
[01:33:04.480 --> 01:33:07.200]   iPad revenue also very strong.
[01:33:07.200 --> 01:33:11.560]   This is the funny thing is that lost in the iPhone loss, which is understandable because
[01:33:11.560 --> 01:33:15.240]   it's almost two thirds of their business, is the fact that the Mac and the iPad had really
[01:33:15.240 --> 01:33:16.240]   good quarters.
[01:33:16.240 --> 01:33:18.440]   It's not surprising when you think about the fact that you got the Mac.
[01:33:18.440 --> 01:33:19.440]   They had new products.
[01:33:19.440 --> 01:33:20.440]   They had new products.
[01:33:20.440 --> 01:33:21.440]   Yeah, imagine that.
[01:33:21.440 --> 01:33:23.480]   You release new products that people want to buy and they're going to give you money
[01:33:23.480 --> 01:33:24.480]   for them.
[01:33:24.480 --> 01:33:30.520]   This is the best iPad year over year, quarterly growth in six years, they said.
[01:33:30.520 --> 01:33:32.440]   But it was a dramatically better iPad.
[01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:33.440]   I mean, I think that was the thing.
[01:33:33.440 --> 01:33:35.000]   I mean, you had a pent up demand for it.
[01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:36.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:37.000]   Yeah.
[01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000]   And the Mac mini, $329 iPad.
[01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.400]   Well, the revenue numbers, right?
[01:33:41.400 --> 01:33:48.160]   That's the revenue numbers are aided by the $1,000 iPad and the $7.99 iPad.
[01:33:48.160 --> 01:33:51.800]   But the Mac mini and the MacBook Air too, which, you know, we, a lot of people roll their
[01:33:51.800 --> 01:33:53.760]   eyes at and say, oh, who cares about those products?
[01:33:53.760 --> 01:33:55.320]   Like it mattered.
[01:33:55.320 --> 01:33:58.920]   There was a lot of pent up demand for those products and the Mac sales show it.
[01:33:58.920 --> 01:34:02.160]   Is there any graph you're particularly fond of that I haven't?
[01:34:02.160 --> 01:34:04.800]   No, they're all just, you know, colorful bar charts.
[01:34:04.800 --> 01:34:05.800]   I don't know.
[01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:06.800]   Okay.
[01:34:06.800 --> 01:34:08.960]   Let's talk about wearable home accessories only because that's gross too.
[01:34:08.960 --> 01:34:12.040]   A little magic trick, which is this used to be called other products and they've decided
[01:34:12.040 --> 01:34:13.040]   to rebrand as.
[01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:15.040]   But there's nothing different.
[01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:17.120]   It is the exact same same.
[01:34:17.120 --> 01:34:18.120]   Same basket.
[01:34:18.120 --> 01:34:19.120]   But it's just the watch.
[01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:20.120]   It's the AirPods.
[01:34:20.120 --> 01:34:21.120]   It's the hobby.
[01:34:21.120 --> 01:34:23.720]   But they've decided to market it a little bit instead of calling it other.
[01:34:23.720 --> 01:34:26.040]   Well, and that's also more accurate.
[01:34:26.040 --> 01:34:27.040]   Yeah, it is.
[01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:28.040]   Right.
[01:34:28.040 --> 01:34:31.440]   AirPods and the watch especially, but also like cases and stuff like that.
[01:34:31.440 --> 01:34:33.040]   Also a record quarter, four point.
[01:34:33.040 --> 01:34:35.640]   Now this is, I'm sorry, this is the fourth quarter average.
[01:34:35.640 --> 01:34:37.720]   So that's the year that is the record.
[01:34:37.720 --> 01:34:39.400]   Yeah, seven point three billion.
[01:34:39.400 --> 01:34:43.040]   So all other aspects of their business are actually doing extremely well.
[01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:45.680]   I don't think that's your way to a new iPhone.
[01:34:45.680 --> 01:34:47.520]   It'll show up like this, right?
[01:34:47.520 --> 01:34:48.520]   Possibly.
[01:34:48.520 --> 01:34:51.960]   Like a very different, if they do, if they do it improve, you know, whether it's in 19
[01:34:51.960 --> 01:34:53.440]   or in 20, that'll happen.
[01:34:53.440 --> 01:34:57.480]   But I think that the, what's interesting, I don't think it's a coincidence because I
[01:34:57.480 --> 01:35:01.640]   think Apple has known, they started talking about services four years ago.
[01:35:01.640 --> 01:35:07.240]   Apple has known for a long time that the smartphone era of explosive growth is over.
[01:35:07.240 --> 01:35:08.240]   Yeah.
[01:35:08.240 --> 01:35:09.680]   And so the question is, how do we keep growing the company?
[01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:10.840]   What else can we do?
[01:35:10.840 --> 01:35:15.800]   I don't think it's an accident at all that all of these other product lines are showing
[01:35:15.800 --> 01:35:18.240]   really good signs right now.
[01:35:18.240 --> 01:35:21.040]   That's one of the ways they counterbalance as much as they can.
[01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:22.040]   Cut it out.
[01:35:22.040 --> 01:35:26.440]   The fact that the iPhone sales, again, are not crashing, but they're not going to be
[01:35:26.440 --> 01:35:27.840]   going up, up, up.
[01:35:27.840 --> 01:35:30.080]   Well, the up, up was not from the US market.
[01:35:30.080 --> 01:35:31.440]   It was from China, you know, maybe up.
[01:35:31.440 --> 01:35:32.440]   Not for a long time.
[01:35:32.440 --> 01:35:33.440]   Yeah.
[01:35:33.440 --> 01:35:37.440]   And so of course, what they got surprised in in the last quarter was that China slowed
[01:35:37.440 --> 01:35:38.920]   and cooled off so quickly.
[01:35:38.920 --> 01:35:39.920]   Yeah.
[01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:40.920]   But they could see it happening.
[01:35:40.920 --> 01:35:41.920]   But they could see it happening.
[01:35:41.920 --> 01:35:47.840]   If you look at the regional year over year growth, China plummeting, if you look at the
[01:35:47.840 --> 01:35:50.040]   regional four quarter average, China going down.
[01:35:50.040 --> 01:35:51.040]   Yeah.
[01:35:51.040 --> 01:35:52.040]   And it's not going to be a long time.
[01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:55.680]   China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, revenue is back
[01:35:55.680 --> 01:36:00.960]   below Europe because Apple has definitely had a challenge in China with iPhone.
[01:36:00.960 --> 01:36:02.280]   I'll show you Tim Cook's favorite chart.
[01:36:02.280 --> 01:36:03.800]   I'll show you right here.
[01:36:03.800 --> 01:36:05.600]   This is total Apple profit.
[01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:06.600]   Money money money.
[01:36:06.600 --> 01:36:08.560]   20 billion dollars in three months.
[01:36:08.560 --> 01:36:10.040]   Walk away with that.
[01:36:10.040 --> 01:36:12.680]   That's almost double what Google made in three months.
[01:36:12.680 --> 01:36:14.960]   Again, you know, Apple doesn't need to go fund me.
[01:36:14.960 --> 01:36:15.960]   They're going to be fine.
[01:36:15.960 --> 01:36:18.640]   Gonna be fine, kids.
[01:36:18.640 --> 01:36:20.640]   That would be my favorite chart.
[01:36:20.640 --> 01:36:21.640]   20 billion.
[01:36:21.640 --> 01:36:22.640]   This is profit.
[01:36:22.640 --> 01:36:26.240]   Well, I love the press that talks about the end of Apple.
[01:36:26.240 --> 01:36:29.520]   You're like, yeah, they're doing okay.
[01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:33.720]   I mean, if they just coasted for the next decade, they would still be making more than
[01:36:33.720 --> 01:36:34.720]   almost everybody else.
[01:36:34.720 --> 01:36:35.720]   That's the big thing about this.
[01:36:35.720 --> 01:36:40.840]   And I know Andy and I have talked about this a lot, this idea that one of Apple's greatest
[01:36:40.840 --> 01:36:43.240]   threats is its success because it's true.
[01:36:43.240 --> 01:36:49.600]   It could do nothing, literally nothing for about 40 years and still pay everybody.
[01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:55.400]   So the challenge is how if you're Tim Cook, I mean, that's why he has one of the hardest
[01:36:55.400 --> 01:37:00.440]   jobs I would say in the tech industry because he has to figure out how to have Apple keep
[01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:05.920]   what makes Apple unique while also making it a very, it is a very different company
[01:37:05.920 --> 01:37:10.680]   than when Steve Jobs was in charge of it already, just in terms of scale.
[01:37:10.680 --> 01:37:11.840]   And how do you manage that?
[01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:18.440]   How do you navigate having this world where the services is a big part of the mix?
[01:37:18.440 --> 01:37:22.760]   It's hard because they have huge resources and they have to choose what to do with them
[01:37:22.760 --> 01:37:23.760]   and what path to walk.
[01:37:23.760 --> 01:37:29.040]   I mean, it's a good problem to have to make $20 billion in a quarter, but still, who are
[01:37:29.040 --> 01:37:30.040]   they now?
[01:37:30.040 --> 01:37:34.040]   And because they aren't the old Apple, they kind of can't be at the scale they are.
[01:37:34.040 --> 01:37:35.040]   Okay.
[01:37:35.040 --> 01:37:36.520]   We buried the lead once again.
[01:37:36.520 --> 01:37:42.080]   The most important story of the week, emoji 12.0 have been announced.
[01:37:42.080 --> 01:37:50.040]   59 new emojis 75 if you include gender variation 230 when you include all the skin tone options
[01:37:50.040 --> 01:37:53.360]   starting with the yawning emoji.
[01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:56.360]   And then I don't know what we're going to characterize this emoji as.
[01:37:56.360 --> 01:37:59.160]   It's a little bitty emoji.
[01:37:59.160 --> 01:38:01.680]   It's a fingers showing size.
[01:38:01.680 --> 01:38:04.960]   Just keep that away from the eggplant emoji and you'll be okay.
[01:38:04.960 --> 01:38:05.960]   I like this one.
[01:38:05.960 --> 01:38:06.960]   Hearing aid emoji.
[01:38:06.960 --> 01:38:09.000]   I don't know when I would use it though.
[01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:10.000]   What?
[01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:11.760]   I can't hear you.
[01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:12.760]   What?
[01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:13.760]   I don't know.
[01:38:13.760 --> 01:38:16.640]   It's also not obvious what it is if you've never worn or seen that known anybody with
[01:38:16.640 --> 01:38:17.640]   a hearing aid.
[01:38:17.640 --> 01:38:20.720]   It's not clear what's wrong with his ear.
[01:38:20.720 --> 01:38:21.720]   What is she doing?
[01:38:21.720 --> 01:38:24.400]   There's a person waving her finger at you.
[01:38:24.400 --> 01:38:25.400]   Oh, I know.
[01:38:25.400 --> 01:38:27.040]   That's the Virgin America.
[01:38:27.040 --> 01:38:29.240]   No smoking finger wave.
[01:38:29.240 --> 01:38:30.640]   She's deaf.
[01:38:30.640 --> 01:38:31.640]   Oh, sorry.
[01:38:31.640 --> 01:38:32.640]   Yeah.
[01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:34.880]   That goes with the hearing aid.
[01:38:34.880 --> 01:38:35.880]   Okay.
[01:38:35.880 --> 01:38:36.880]   So they're tapping their ear.
[01:38:36.880 --> 01:38:37.880]   Okay.
[01:38:37.880 --> 01:38:41.000]   See, that just shows you how emojis are not immediately obvious.
[01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:46.360]   But if you're used to ASL, right, that would be, I can't, I don't, I'm deaf.
[01:38:46.360 --> 01:38:47.880]   Okay, I get it.
[01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:48.880]   Sorry.
[01:38:48.880 --> 01:38:50.040]   Is that ASL or is that a universal sign?
[01:38:50.040 --> 01:38:52.680]   I don't know because the different sign languages had different signs too.
[01:38:52.680 --> 01:38:53.680]   I don't know.
[01:38:53.680 --> 01:38:55.880]   I imagine that Jeremy at Emojipedia will explain all.
[01:38:55.880 --> 01:38:57.440]   He'll explain and we'll have Jeremy on.
[01:38:57.440 --> 01:38:58.440]   I'm sure.
[01:38:58.440 --> 01:38:59.440]   About the cultural background of all these signs.
[01:38:59.440 --> 01:39:01.160]   A lot of this was for people of differing abilities.
[01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:04.360]   Here's a prosthetic limb, an arm and a leg.
[01:39:04.360 --> 01:39:05.640]   People and chairs.
[01:39:05.640 --> 01:39:08.600]   And by the way, motorized and unmotorized.
[01:39:08.600 --> 01:39:10.840]   Nice to have the distinction there.
[01:39:10.840 --> 01:39:14.600]   Here is somebody with a cane.
[01:39:14.600 --> 01:39:15.600]   What's the deal with these people?
[01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:17.680]   I don't know.
[01:39:17.680 --> 01:39:18.680]   They're hair disabled.
[01:39:18.680 --> 01:39:19.960]   What is the, I don't know.
[01:39:19.960 --> 01:39:21.320]   Here's somebody kneeling.
[01:39:21.320 --> 01:39:22.960]   Is that a yoga position?
[01:39:22.960 --> 01:39:26.080]   I don't, sometimes I wonder what, what is new about these?
[01:39:26.080 --> 01:39:27.080]   I don't get it.
[01:39:27.080 --> 01:39:29.280]   What's new about those people standing?
[01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:31.960]   Do they never have that before?
[01:39:31.960 --> 01:39:36.320]   Now they have people standing and you can mix and match both genders and colors as they
[01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:39.320]   hold hands.
[01:39:39.320 --> 01:39:43.040]   Very, very wonderful, inclusive.
[01:39:43.040 --> 01:39:45.760]   Yes, standing, kneeling.
[01:39:45.760 --> 01:39:46.760]   Standing and kneeling.
[01:39:46.760 --> 01:39:47.760]   Okay.
[01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:49.400]   We didn't have that before.
[01:39:49.400 --> 01:39:50.400]   Nope.
[01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:51.400]   Okay.
[01:39:51.400 --> 01:39:52.400]   We've had holding hands for some time.
[01:39:52.400 --> 01:39:53.400]   We have a slaw.
[01:39:53.400 --> 01:39:54.400]   We have a slaw.
[01:39:54.400 --> 01:39:57.640]   We've got, maybe they're the ones that work better when they place next to other emojis
[01:39:57.640 --> 01:39:58.640]   like a campfire.
[01:39:58.640 --> 01:40:00.480]   Ah, that's it.
[01:40:00.480 --> 01:40:05.280]   And now we have for your delectation, the really the new icons.
[01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:09.080]   And these are seeing eye dogs to different kinds or maybe, oh, wait a minute, one of
[01:40:09.080 --> 01:40:10.080]   us animals.
[01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:11.080]   One's a service animal.
[01:40:11.080 --> 01:40:12.080]   One's a seeing eye dog.
[01:40:12.080 --> 01:40:13.080]   Okay.
[01:40:13.080 --> 01:40:14.080]   Got it.
[01:40:14.080 --> 01:40:15.080]   A flamingo on one leg.
[01:40:15.080 --> 01:40:16.080]   Okay.
[01:40:16.080 --> 01:40:17.080]   Now you're going to have to help me with your animal.
[01:40:17.080 --> 01:40:20.120]   Lord, that a lemur or a sloth?
[01:40:20.120 --> 01:40:21.760]   That's in the sea otter, right?
[01:40:21.760 --> 01:40:22.760]   Yeah.
[01:40:22.760 --> 01:40:23.760]   Still no honey bad.
[01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:24.760]   Rangutan and still.
[01:40:24.760 --> 01:40:25.760]   Still no honey badger.
[01:40:25.760 --> 01:40:26.760]   Skunk, I know.
[01:40:26.760 --> 01:40:29.440]   A waffle with butter, butter by itself.
[01:40:29.440 --> 01:40:31.840]   I think it's supposedly is baked potatoes, but that's disgusting.
[01:40:31.840 --> 01:40:32.840]   I don't know what that was.
[01:40:32.840 --> 01:40:33.840]   I thought that was a coconut.
[01:40:33.840 --> 01:40:34.840]   Yeah.
[01:40:34.840 --> 01:40:35.840]   What is that?
[01:40:35.840 --> 01:40:36.840]   I don't know.
[01:40:36.840 --> 01:40:37.840]   Maybe it's a coconut.
[01:40:37.840 --> 01:40:38.840]   Maybe it's a baked potato.
[01:40:38.840 --> 01:40:39.840]   That's bagel gate.
[01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:40.840]   Garlic.
[01:40:40.840 --> 01:40:44.160]   Garlic, these are the official reference emojis from the Emojis.
[01:40:44.160 --> 01:40:46.320]   The consortium, we didn't see the apples.
[01:40:46.320 --> 01:40:47.880]   No, no, no, I don't think these are official.
[01:40:47.880 --> 01:40:52.040]   I think these are Emojipedia commissions and artists to do this as references.
[01:40:52.040 --> 01:40:56.120]   I think, I think, and, you know, the story of just as words, right?
[01:40:56.120 --> 01:41:01.080]   It's on the committee, but I think the consortium just does, like, those patent illustrations,
[01:41:01.080 --> 01:41:02.840]   does, like, little outlines and words.
[01:41:02.840 --> 01:41:03.840]   Oh, okay.
[01:41:03.840 --> 01:41:06.000]   And then Jeremy Burge is the one who commits this art.
[01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:07.000]   Okay, these are Jeremy's emoji piece.
[01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:10.920]   This is the thing that's not widely known is that there is no reference emoji per se.
[01:41:10.920 --> 01:41:14.680]   In terms of the art, there's kind of emoji fragmentation.
[01:41:14.680 --> 01:41:20.240]   The all of the major vendors are on the emoji committee, so I think they have all, they're
[01:41:20.240 --> 01:41:21.240]   all converging.
[01:41:21.240 --> 01:41:22.240]   Yeah, way in.
[01:41:22.240 --> 01:41:23.240]   Yeah.
[01:41:23.240 --> 01:41:24.240]   But they all have to do their own art.
[01:41:24.240 --> 01:41:28.800]   And artists to make the emoji PDF version, because he knows people are interested in this.
[01:41:28.800 --> 01:41:32.320]   And we won't see this until October, probably on iOS.
[01:41:32.320 --> 01:41:33.320]   Yeah.
[01:41:33.320 --> 01:41:34.320]   And then sometimes it's 12 points.
[01:41:34.320 --> 01:41:35.320]   Yeah.
[01:41:35.320 --> 01:41:36.320]   Yeah.
[01:41:36.320 --> 01:41:37.320]   I'm really unhappy with the garlic.
[01:41:37.320 --> 01:41:39.600]   I think that the garlic, that's Jeremy.
[01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:40.600]   This is Jeremy.
[01:41:40.600 --> 01:41:45.080]   So, Jeremy, I'm sorry, but, Carson, would you look that up?
[01:41:45.080 --> 01:41:46.600]   Is that a potato or a coconut?
[01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:47.600]   What is that?
[01:41:47.600 --> 01:41:48.600]   There's an onion.
[01:41:48.600 --> 01:41:50.280]   And he's a juice box.
[01:41:50.280 --> 01:41:55.760]   I love this Urban Matei Cup, which will only be recognized in some South American countries.
[01:41:55.760 --> 01:41:59.760]   But I have a Paraguayan Urban Matei Cup that looks just like that.
[01:41:59.760 --> 01:42:01.000]   I don't even know what's next to it.
[01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:02.000]   Perlin and Oyster.
[01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:03.560]   Perlin and Oyster.
[01:42:03.560 --> 01:42:04.560]   Or a Lugi.
[01:42:04.560 --> 01:42:05.560]   I don't know.
[01:42:05.560 --> 01:42:06.560]   Yeah, I know.
[01:42:06.560 --> 01:42:07.560]   I look at it.
[01:42:07.560 --> 01:42:08.560]   I don't know.
[01:42:08.560 --> 01:42:09.560]   I don't know.
[01:42:09.560 --> 01:42:10.560]   Guy in a parachute.
[01:42:10.560 --> 01:42:11.560]   Tidy Whiteys.
[01:42:11.560 --> 01:42:12.560]   A safety coat.
[01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:14.920]   That's a falafel.
[01:42:14.920 --> 01:42:15.920]   That's a falafel.
[01:42:15.920 --> 01:42:16.920]   Neither an eggplant.
[01:42:16.920 --> 01:42:19.160]   I just recognize it out of its key.
[01:42:19.160 --> 01:42:21.680]   Yeah, without a pita, I don't know.
[01:42:21.680 --> 01:42:22.680]   That's a falafel.
[01:42:22.680 --> 01:42:24.200]   Or some hummus.
[01:42:24.200 --> 01:42:27.560]   And is this a saree?
[01:42:27.560 --> 01:42:35.720]   This, but Toshu's a snorkel and mask bathing suits for men and women and Corwatt gets its
[01:42:35.720 --> 01:42:36.720]   own.
[01:42:36.720 --> 01:42:37.720]   It's not even a temple.
[01:42:37.720 --> 01:42:38.720]   In the temple.
[01:42:38.720 --> 01:42:39.720]   Yeah.
[01:42:39.720 --> 01:42:40.720]   Hindu.
[01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:42.560]   Hindu temples, not anchor what?
[01:42:42.560 --> 01:42:47.600]   There's a cane, wheelchairs of two different varieties, Deathoscope.
[01:42:47.600 --> 01:42:48.600]   What is that?
[01:42:48.600 --> 01:42:49.600]   Blood.
[01:42:49.600 --> 01:42:53.640]   Drop of blood and a Band-Aid to go with the hypodermic.
[01:42:53.640 --> 01:42:54.640]   Huh.
[01:42:54.640 --> 01:42:55.640]   Finally.
[01:42:55.640 --> 01:42:56.640]   You don't need some blood, Raisa.
[01:42:56.640 --> 01:42:57.640]   You can use your blood emoji.
[01:42:57.640 --> 01:42:58.640]   Yes, straight edge razor.
[01:42:58.640 --> 01:42:59.640]   Wow.
[01:42:59.640 --> 01:43:01.640]   I think that that may be a controversial one.
[01:43:01.640 --> 01:43:02.640]   And the axe.
[01:43:02.640 --> 01:43:03.640]   As with the axe.
[01:43:03.640 --> 01:43:04.640]   It's just razor.
[01:43:04.640 --> 01:43:05.640]   Razor.
[01:43:05.640 --> 01:43:07.240]   Companies are free to use their own.
[01:43:07.240 --> 01:43:08.240]   Interesting.
[01:43:08.240 --> 01:43:10.240]   And then this one's called the Lizzy Borden, right?
[01:43:10.240 --> 01:43:11.240]   The axe.
[01:43:11.240 --> 01:43:12.240]   Exactly.
[01:43:12.240 --> 01:43:13.240]   We've got a kite.
[01:43:13.240 --> 01:43:17.200]   We've got a yo-yo, a chair, and a finally, ladies and gentlemen, a banjo.
[01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:19.200]   We've needed that for so long.
[01:43:19.200 --> 01:43:20.200]   Long last.
[01:43:20.200 --> 01:43:21.960]   A sweaty ice cube, I guess.
[01:43:21.960 --> 01:43:23.520]   I don't know.
[01:43:23.520 --> 01:43:24.520]   What is this next one here?
[01:43:24.520 --> 01:43:25.920]   Is that a candle lamp?
[01:43:25.920 --> 01:43:28.520]   It's like an olive oil lamp.
[01:43:28.520 --> 01:43:29.520]   Saturn?
[01:43:29.520 --> 01:43:30.520]   It's not a card.
[01:43:30.520 --> 01:43:31.520]   Do we have Jupiter right now?
[01:43:31.520 --> 01:43:34.160]   I think I'd be, if I were in the Mars contingent, I'd be very upset.
[01:43:34.160 --> 01:43:36.000]   I wonder if that's a planet emoji.
[01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:37.000]   It's a planet emoji.
[01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:38.000]   Yeah.
[01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:39.000]   Yeah.
[01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:40.000]   But that is a ring to planet.
[01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:41.000]   Ring to ring.
[01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:42.000]   Oh, how many rings?
[01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:43.000]   Odds are there?
[01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:44.000]   There's some Saturn.
[01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:45.000]   There's this particular solar system.
[01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:46.000]   There's the one big one that you've heard of.
[01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:47.880]   Are there women?
[01:43:47.880 --> 01:43:49.600]   Are there some unknown ringed planets?
[01:43:49.600 --> 01:43:53.040]   Well, Jupiter, Jupiter, Uranus, Neptune all have rings.
[01:43:53.040 --> 01:43:54.480]   But you just can't see them?
[01:43:54.480 --> 01:43:55.480]   Yeah.
[01:43:55.480 --> 01:43:56.480]   Do we have rings?
[01:43:56.480 --> 01:43:57.480]   No, we don't.
[01:43:57.480 --> 01:43:58.480]   We got a ring too.
[01:43:58.480 --> 01:43:59.480]   We don't.
[01:43:59.480 --> 01:44:00.480]   That's a lie, don't believe it.
[01:44:00.480 --> 01:44:01.480]   Don't believe the ring, the ring people.
[01:44:01.480 --> 01:44:04.080]   Did you know that the rings are a relatively late phenomenon?
[01:44:04.080 --> 01:44:05.080]   Yes.
[01:44:05.080 --> 01:44:06.080]   That's wild.
[01:44:06.080 --> 01:44:08.120]   I thought, oh, that must be millions of years old.
[01:44:08.120 --> 01:44:10.160]   No, it was like 2004.
[01:44:10.160 --> 01:44:11.160]   Or something.
[01:44:11.160 --> 01:44:12.160]   Interesting.
[01:44:12.160 --> 01:44:14.440]   The lamp is a dia lamp.
[01:44:14.440 --> 01:44:15.440]   A dia lamp.
[01:44:15.440 --> 01:44:17.520]   It's another hindu.
[01:44:17.520 --> 01:44:19.320]   A dia lamp.
[01:44:19.320 --> 01:44:20.320]   Okay.
[01:44:20.320 --> 01:44:25.840]   A white heart and a copper heart to go with the red, white, blue hearts.
[01:44:25.840 --> 01:44:28.320]   And are these emoji or just colors?
[01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:31.840]   Those are color orange circle, yellow circle, green circle.
[01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:32.840]   Oh, yeah.
[01:44:32.840 --> 01:44:33.960]   Just more shapes with colors.
[01:44:33.960 --> 01:44:35.360]   Shapes with colors.
[01:44:35.360 --> 01:44:36.880]   Your favorites in here, guys?
[01:44:36.880 --> 01:44:38.080]   You got one that you really like?
[01:44:38.080 --> 01:44:40.080]   You're going to be using a lot?
[01:44:40.080 --> 01:44:44.920]   I think the waffle for me is something I'm going to find many, many uses for a waffle.
[01:44:44.920 --> 01:44:46.920]   I don't know.
[01:44:46.920 --> 01:44:48.760]   I don't know.
[01:44:48.760 --> 01:44:51.440]   I think the razor has Sweeney Todd.
[01:44:51.440 --> 01:44:52.440]   There's a very sweetie.
[01:44:52.440 --> 01:44:53.440]   Yeah.
[01:44:53.440 --> 01:44:56.440]   Especially combined with the blood drop, I think you could really have some fun.
[01:44:56.440 --> 01:44:59.080]   Next up next to a pie and a blood drop next to me.
[01:44:59.080 --> 01:45:00.080]   Oh, excellent.
[01:45:00.080 --> 01:45:02.280]   I'm going to be using the little itty bitty.
[01:45:02.280 --> 01:45:03.280]   Itty bitty.
[01:45:03.280 --> 01:45:04.280]   Yeah, just a little.
[01:45:04.280 --> 01:45:05.280]   Little, just a little.
[01:45:05.280 --> 01:45:06.280]   Just a little.
[01:45:06.280 --> 01:45:07.280]   It's called the just a little.
[01:45:07.280 --> 01:45:08.280]   What is the?
[01:45:08.280 --> 01:45:09.280]   Okay.
[01:45:09.280 --> 01:45:10.280]   Now, Carson, what are the names?
[01:45:10.280 --> 01:45:11.280]   What's the name of that?
[01:45:11.280 --> 01:45:13.320]   You're looking at the text description.
[01:45:13.320 --> 01:45:14.320]   What is the name of that?
[01:45:14.320 --> 01:45:15.320]   I think that'll be the next time.
[01:45:15.320 --> 01:45:19.240]   It's known as pinching hand, like skin tone, medium light skin tone.
[01:45:19.240 --> 01:45:20.240]   Pinching hand.
[01:45:20.240 --> 01:45:21.240]   Pinching hand.
[01:45:21.240 --> 01:45:22.760]   I think it was like, are you mad?
[01:45:22.760 --> 01:45:25.040]   In context, did someone ask, are you mad?
[01:45:25.040 --> 01:45:26.800]   And then you send that back.
[01:45:26.800 --> 01:45:27.800]   Yawny face.
[01:45:27.800 --> 01:45:28.800]   Yawny face.
[01:45:28.800 --> 01:45:32.040]   I realize that people, you know, they were probably listeners who were like, why are
[01:45:32.040 --> 01:45:33.360]   they talking about emoji?
[01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:36.080]   But because I always hear from those people, the emoji curmudgeons.
[01:45:36.080 --> 01:45:37.080]   But like, emoji.
[01:45:37.080 --> 01:45:38.680]   Don't be emoji curmudgeon.
[01:45:38.680 --> 01:45:39.680]   People use it.
[01:45:39.680 --> 01:45:40.680]   It's expressive.
[01:45:40.680 --> 01:45:42.040]   It is the solution to the thing.
[01:45:42.040 --> 01:45:45.520]   You know, we've been online, all of us, for a long time now.
[01:45:45.520 --> 01:45:49.800]   And one of the things you find when you go online is that text doesn't do it, right?
[01:45:49.800 --> 01:45:53.680]   Like text, it's really easy to be misinterpreted with text.
[01:45:53.680 --> 01:45:58.800]   And emoji really has kind of found this place where it's more expressive.
[01:45:58.800 --> 01:45:59.800]   I look at it.
[01:45:59.800 --> 01:46:01.480]   It's so much easier to communicate.
[01:46:01.480 --> 01:46:02.480]   It's a line to really emoji.
[01:46:02.480 --> 01:46:03.480]   We started with emoji.
[01:46:03.480 --> 01:46:04.480]   And then we went to text.
[01:46:04.480 --> 01:46:05.480]   And now we're going back to emoji.
[01:46:05.480 --> 01:46:10.400]   You know, like, you know, I look at my daughter will send me this long string of emojis.
[01:46:10.400 --> 01:46:12.400]   And I'm like, it looks like hieroglyphics.
[01:46:12.400 --> 01:46:15.800]   You know, like, it's just like a whole, you know, there's a whole little process there.
[01:46:15.800 --> 01:46:17.200]   Some rejects.
[01:46:17.200 --> 01:46:21.040]   The why you know fingers together.
[01:46:21.040 --> 01:46:24.120]   Why you know, apparently, and kissy chef.
[01:46:24.120 --> 01:46:25.120]   I don't.
[01:46:25.120 --> 01:46:26.120]   These are, these are much requested.
[01:46:26.120 --> 01:46:27.400]   Chef's kiss is not.
[01:46:27.400 --> 01:46:31.680]   You have to give Apple some credit for the people of disabilities, emojis.
[01:46:31.680 --> 01:46:35.760]   That was a big push from Apple.
[01:46:35.760 --> 01:46:40.320]   Flamingo, sloth, triceratops, and dog faces were requested.
[01:46:40.320 --> 01:46:45.160]   And for some reason, the white heart, which did in fact get in there, was highly requested.
[01:46:45.160 --> 01:46:47.160]   No Wi-Fi symbol.
[01:46:47.160 --> 01:46:49.000]   These are the already approved ones.
[01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:50.920]   So there you go.
[01:46:50.920 --> 01:46:51.920]   Badger.
[01:46:51.920 --> 01:46:52.920]   Where's our Badger?
[01:46:52.920 --> 01:46:53.920]   It didn't make it.
[01:46:53.920 --> 01:46:54.920]   I think we started to improve.
[01:46:54.920 --> 01:46:55.920]   I think we started to improve.
[01:46:55.920 --> 01:46:58.440]   Oh, no, the Badger's been approved, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:46:58.440 --> 01:47:00.480]   But it's not a honey Badger.
[01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:01.480]   It's just a Badger Badger.
[01:47:01.480 --> 01:47:04.520]   Well, you just put the beehive emoji in the badger.
[01:47:04.520 --> 01:47:06.040]   You can make it.
[01:47:06.040 --> 01:47:08.480]   That's really part of the fun of emojis is the creative.
[01:47:08.480 --> 01:47:09.480]   Making a rebus.
[01:47:09.480 --> 01:47:12.080]   Creative emoji rebus.
[01:47:12.080 --> 01:47:13.080]   Wow.
[01:47:13.080 --> 01:47:14.080]   Wow.
[01:47:14.080 --> 01:47:15.080]   Okay.
[01:47:15.080 --> 01:47:17.800]   Have we covered this to your satisfaction?
[01:47:17.800 --> 01:47:34.880]   Adn
[01:47:34.880 --> 01:47:37.840]   And that's what you're going to see in every country that demands that.
[01:47:37.840 --> 01:47:38.840]   I think so.
[01:47:38.840 --> 01:47:43.000]   Apple has reached a deal with France to pay a half billion dollar, happily in Euro fine.
[01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.920]   I mentioned that earlier.
[01:47:45.920 --> 01:47:47.720]   In back taxes.
[01:47:47.720 --> 01:47:49.120]   We didn't mention it in the show though.
[01:47:49.120 --> 01:47:50.520]   I think I mentioned it before the show.
[01:47:50.520 --> 01:47:57.360]   If I did, I apologize if I've already said that.
[01:47:57.360 --> 01:48:02.240]   Did you do the Apple Heart Month activity challenge on your watch?
[01:48:02.240 --> 01:48:03.240]   No.
[01:48:03.240 --> 01:48:04.240]   Me neither.
[01:48:04.240 --> 01:48:09.320]   I will admit though that I find myself each day trying to figure out how I'm going to close
[01:48:09.320 --> 01:48:10.320]   my rings.
[01:48:10.320 --> 01:48:11.320]   It does work.
[01:48:11.320 --> 01:48:12.320]   It does work.
[01:48:12.320 --> 01:48:13.320]   Like I'm just like, oh, I'll walk a little bit more.
[01:48:13.320 --> 01:48:14.320]   I'll do this.
[01:48:14.320 --> 01:48:16.400]   That notification at 11.45 PM.
[01:48:16.400 --> 01:48:19.400]   You just want just a mile and a half walk or close that ring.
[01:48:19.400 --> 01:48:21.040]   I'm going to run out that door.
[01:48:21.040 --> 01:48:22.040]   I don't go.
[01:48:22.040 --> 01:48:23.040]   I don't go that far.
[01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:24.040]   Okay.
[01:48:24.040 --> 01:48:25.040]   That's a little over the top.
[01:48:25.040 --> 01:48:26.640]   Apple music is free now on American flights.
[01:48:26.640 --> 01:48:27.640]   Yeah.
[01:48:27.640 --> 01:48:31.040]   And I would imagine they're going to preload all their video originals on there too, right?
[01:48:31.040 --> 01:48:32.040]   When those come out.
[01:48:32.040 --> 01:48:34.800]   I imagine every airline will jump on that.
[01:48:34.800 --> 01:48:36.400]   This is the way of marketing now.
[01:48:36.400 --> 01:48:37.400]   Very smart.
[01:48:37.400 --> 01:48:38.440]   Netflix is a similar deal with somebody.
[01:48:38.440 --> 01:48:40.800]   You have to subscribe to Apple music to be able to listen.
[01:48:40.800 --> 01:48:41.800]   I bet you do.
[01:48:41.800 --> 01:48:42.800]   I don't think you do.
[01:48:42.800 --> 01:48:47.520]   I think they have curated playlists that you can listen to without being a subscriber.
[01:48:47.520 --> 01:48:52.760]   Apple music subscribers can stream over 50 million songs, but I bet you're right that
[01:48:52.760 --> 01:48:55.600]   if you're a non-subscribers, it's like some curated playlists.
[01:48:55.600 --> 01:48:56.600]   Something like that.
[01:48:56.600 --> 01:49:01.640]   But the idea is that, yeah, if you are a customer, you can use the plain Wi-Fi to listen to that.
[01:49:01.640 --> 01:49:03.160]   I'm paying for a plain Wi-Fi.
[01:49:03.160 --> 01:49:04.640]   I think that actually is great.
[01:49:04.640 --> 01:49:07.560]   It actually does make me, well, it does two things.
[01:49:07.560 --> 01:49:10.200]   Either make me want to fly American or have an Apple music subscription.
[01:49:10.200 --> 01:49:11.200]   I already have the Apple music subscription.
[01:49:11.200 --> 01:49:13.000]   I just load all my songs all the time.
[01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:14.000]   I do.
[01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:15.000]   Any playlists I just like.
[01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:16.000]   I know.
[01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:17.000]   Isn't that a pain?
[01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:22.400]   Your Beats One Global Live Stream are curated playlists as well.
[01:49:22.400 --> 01:49:25.160]   So that's I think for people who are not members.
[01:49:25.160 --> 01:49:26.160]   Yeah.
[01:49:26.160 --> 01:49:30.120]   Because you could Beats One if you're not a member, right?
[01:49:30.120 --> 01:49:31.600]   This is what I meant by Apple.
[01:49:31.600 --> 01:49:33.160]   It's not the same company it used to be.
[01:49:33.160 --> 01:49:39.200]   They're making like online content deals from online to airline now.
[01:49:39.200 --> 01:49:42.480]   I've never really talked about the numbers and how many people will listen to Beats One,
[01:49:42.480 --> 01:49:45.080]   but I bet you it's a really large number.
[01:49:45.080 --> 01:49:47.880]   We don't think, I mean, I probably listen.
[01:49:47.880 --> 01:49:49.680]   The guys used to listen to it in the shop.
[01:49:49.680 --> 01:49:55.640]   That's the radio station, the Juulian, and Tanuka, and Zane, Zach, Lo, and all those.
[01:49:55.640 --> 01:49:56.640]   Yeah.
[01:49:56.640 --> 01:49:58.880]   I bet you that number though is big.
[01:49:58.880 --> 01:49:59.880]   Compared to radio stations.
[01:49:59.880 --> 01:50:04.040]   You know, like when you think of a regular terrestrial radio station and you're in LA
[01:50:04.040 --> 01:50:09.560]   or New York market, you might have 10 million or 5 million or whatever the queue is.
[01:50:09.560 --> 01:50:12.120]   I bet you the number is much bigger than that.
[01:50:12.120 --> 01:50:21.320]   JP Morgan says at Bank Analyst Note that Apple should take its 250 billion in cash and buy
[01:50:21.320 --> 01:50:22.320]   Netflix.
[01:50:22.320 --> 01:50:23.320]   Disney.
[01:50:23.320 --> 01:50:27.080]   JP Morgan, thank you for the suggestion.
[01:50:27.080 --> 01:50:33.360]   Because the most important thing to do when you have a big, big pile of cash is to spend
[01:50:33.360 --> 01:50:34.360]   all of it.
[01:50:34.360 --> 01:50:36.160]   Spend it so you can make more.
[01:50:36.160 --> 01:50:37.160]   What's that business value?
[01:50:37.160 --> 01:50:42.240]   Spend it on a company that has gone into a large amount of debt in order to get market
[01:50:42.240 --> 01:50:46.800]   share, buy buying content, the business that you are also now buying content.
[01:50:46.800 --> 01:50:50.040]   I think we're in agreement that Apple should not buy Netflix.
[01:50:50.040 --> 01:50:55.600]   Yeah, I mean, they could, but I think- They could buy an island's nation.
[01:50:55.600 --> 01:50:56.600]   They could.
[01:50:56.600 --> 01:50:57.600]   They could buy.
[01:50:57.600 --> 01:51:03.720]   I think Canada would be less than that, but they should.
[01:51:03.720 --> 01:51:04.720]   Probably not.
[01:51:04.720 --> 01:51:05.720]   Stay away.
[01:51:05.720 --> 01:51:08.440]   You think that's what my Netflix?
[01:51:08.440 --> 01:51:09.440]   Disney.
[01:51:09.440 --> 01:51:10.440]   Disney.
[01:51:10.440 --> 01:51:11.440]   No.
[01:51:11.440 --> 01:51:12.440]   Oh, that's all we need.
[01:51:12.440 --> 01:51:13.440]   Disney's more than 200 billion.
[01:51:13.440 --> 01:51:16.120]   I like the eye rolls that Andy is doing.
[01:51:16.120 --> 01:51:19.640]   Like I can feel them all the way across the country.
[01:51:19.640 --> 01:51:25.800]   It's just that they're not creative stewards of the things that they buy.
[01:51:25.800 --> 01:51:29.560]   They always go for the most commercial thing they can possibly go for as opposed to something
[01:51:29.560 --> 01:51:33.480]   like Netflix or Hulu or one of these streaming services that needs to have a certain amount
[01:51:33.480 --> 01:51:34.600]   of character to it.
[01:51:34.600 --> 01:51:39.040]   It has to do some things that are really kind of out of the, not only have the hits, but
[01:51:39.040 --> 01:51:43.400]   also has to get some things that are sort of out of the normal realm of what most people
[01:51:43.400 --> 01:51:46.920]   are looking for because there's going to be that 10% of everybody that's looking for
[01:51:46.920 --> 01:51:49.280]   something that they've never heard of before.
[01:51:49.280 --> 01:51:54.200]   And I think it would be dangerous if Disney were to buy it and plug Netflix into its-
[01:51:54.200 --> 01:51:55.200]   No, no, I'm not talking about Disney.
[01:51:55.200 --> 01:51:56.200]   There's obviously buying Netflix.
[01:51:56.200 --> 01:51:57.920]   I'm talking about Apple buying Disney.
[01:51:57.920 --> 01:52:01.080]   Apple, we just looked at Disney's market cap for 85 billion.
[01:52:01.080 --> 01:52:04.160]   Apple could buy 51% of Disney.
[01:52:04.160 --> 01:52:05.160]   Just take it over.
[01:52:05.160 --> 01:52:10.480]   I mean, the thing is, is that there's so many crossovers for Apple when it comes to experience
[01:52:10.480 --> 01:52:14.800]   at the Disneyland and Disney World and AR and tying and all the stuff and using it as a
[01:52:14.800 --> 01:52:18.480]   big, you know, there's that there's all the Disney characters they could be using for
[01:52:18.480 --> 01:52:19.480]   things.
[01:52:19.480 --> 01:52:21.680]   Then there's just buffing up the content.
[01:52:21.680 --> 01:52:22.680]   Apple.
[01:52:22.680 --> 01:52:23.680]   What would they do with it?
[01:52:23.680 --> 01:52:27.680]   I think we really are to get that IP otherwise.
[01:52:27.680 --> 01:52:29.600]   Star Wars and their Marvel owner.
[01:52:29.600 --> 01:52:34.680]   A reconceptualization of what Apple is beyond even what we've talked about today, right?
[01:52:34.680 --> 01:52:41.480]   Which I can't say it's not possible because I feel like with Amazon and Google and Apple,
[01:52:41.480 --> 01:52:44.320]   these companies are so enormous that who's to say that they won't-
[01:52:44.320 --> 01:52:45.320]   Spotify is-
[01:52:45.320 --> 01:52:46.320]   And they continue swallowing other companies.
[01:52:46.320 --> 01:52:49.520]   Spotify is buying gimlet for 200 million.
[01:52:49.520 --> 01:52:51.360]   Odd sell, twit for 100 million.
[01:52:51.360 --> 01:52:54.360]   No problem.
[01:52:54.360 --> 01:52:59.440]   Apple could buy Disney if they were to decide that they don't care about being a technology
[01:52:59.440 --> 01:53:01.560]   company or a design company anymore.
[01:53:01.560 --> 01:53:08.320]   If they wanted to redefine themselves as sort of a 3M, just we are a company that buys
[01:53:08.320 --> 01:53:09.320]   other companies.
[01:53:09.320 --> 01:53:12.240]   We don't actually make anything.
[01:53:12.240 --> 01:53:13.480]   But that's not the character of Apple.
[01:53:13.480 --> 01:53:17.120]   I don't think they would give half a damn about owning Disney.
[01:53:17.120 --> 01:53:20.000]   I think we all agree that the JP Morgan analyst is full of it though.
[01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:21.000]   Yeah.
[01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:22.000]   That's not going to matter.
[01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.600]   This is maybe this last words that we're going to come back to this.
[01:53:24.600 --> 01:53:28.560]   In six months when Apple owns Netflix and we'll be like, "Oh, no, I know.
[01:53:28.560 --> 01:53:30.800]   I was the one who said Apple will never buy Beats.
[01:53:30.800 --> 01:53:31.800]   What is that?
[01:53:31.800 --> 01:53:32.800]   That's crazy.
[01:53:32.800 --> 01:53:34.600]   That's a false rumor."
[01:53:34.600 --> 01:53:38.000]   Which was immediately debunked like three minutes after I said it.
[01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.280]   All right, let's take a final break.
[01:53:40.280 --> 01:53:44.360]   And then if you would, I think Jason has a rather elaborate pick of the week.
[01:53:44.360 --> 01:53:45.800]   Oh, do you want to mention this?
[01:53:45.800 --> 01:53:46.800]   We have a-
[01:53:46.800 --> 01:53:47.800]   Breaking news.
[01:53:47.800 --> 01:53:48.800]   Breaking Angela Aron's-
[01:53:48.800 --> 01:53:49.800]   The Apple Retail Chief is leaving apparently.
[01:53:49.800 --> 01:53:50.800]   Oh, okay.
[01:53:50.800 --> 01:53:55.840]   So I misunderstood the import of that press release.
[01:53:55.840 --> 01:53:59.080]   They've got a new executive in charge of retail and people-
[01:53:59.080 --> 01:54:00.080]   Right.
[01:54:00.080 --> 01:54:01.080]   Deirdre O'Brien.
[01:54:01.080 --> 01:54:05.960]   But I didn't understand she was, "Oh my goodness, replacing Angela Aron's."
[01:54:05.960 --> 01:54:06.960]   Yeah.
[01:54:06.960 --> 01:54:08.200]   That is a big deal.
[01:54:08.200 --> 01:54:12.800]   It's five years Angela Aron's has been at Apple Retail just longer than after being CEO
[01:54:12.800 --> 01:54:15.600]   of Burberry, but she's leaving and they have a new-
[01:54:15.600 --> 01:54:19.760]   And it was only in October that Angela Aron's appeared on stage.
[01:54:19.760 --> 01:54:21.240]   And a fine Burberry coach.
[01:54:21.240 --> 01:54:25.720]   You know, she has been the best dressed person on stage at Apple events ever.
[01:54:25.720 --> 01:54:26.720]   And I will miss that because-
[01:54:26.720 --> 01:54:29.280]   This has to be a surprise for Apple, right?
[01:54:29.280 --> 01:54:30.280]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:54:30.280 --> 01:54:34.640]   What if you're wonderful if like best part of her tenure, she took upon herself to like
[01:54:34.640 --> 01:54:39.760]   dress the other people on stage by saying, "You know, maybe you could like-
[01:54:39.760 --> 01:54:40.760]   I don't know.
[01:54:40.760 --> 01:54:43.680]   You're the CEO of a big company just dressed up a little bit."
[01:54:43.680 --> 01:54:49.040]   Deirdre O'Brien is an in-house promotion.
[01:54:49.040 --> 01:54:50.920]   She's been at Apple for 30 years.
[01:54:50.920 --> 01:54:53.840]   Yeah, and was the head of what they call people, which is because-
[01:54:53.840 --> 01:54:54.840]   HR.
[01:54:54.840 --> 01:54:56.840]   It was personnel, then it was HR.
[01:54:56.840 --> 01:55:00.400]   Now it's people, but that also includes things like Apple University.
[01:55:00.400 --> 01:55:02.320]   And of course, it seems weird.
[01:55:02.320 --> 01:55:07.640]   It is also true though that the vast majority of Apple's employees are retail employees.
[01:55:07.640 --> 01:55:09.640]   So you know, they have a lot of-
[01:55:09.640 --> 01:55:13.800]   So, but I do have to wonder if this is a temporary appointment until they can find
[01:55:13.800 --> 01:55:15.160]   somebody with the kind of retail.
[01:55:15.160 --> 01:55:18.760]   You know, they had a very bad experience prior to Angela Aron's with Tom Johnson, who
[01:55:18.760 --> 01:55:20.160]   came from JCPenney.
[01:55:20.160 --> 01:55:22.360]   He wasn't a good match or went to JCPenney.
[01:55:22.360 --> 01:55:23.360]   No, no, no, no, no.
[01:55:23.360 --> 01:55:24.680]   Ron Johnson started it and he was good.
[01:55:24.680 --> 01:55:27.840]   It was the guy from the reseller in the UK.
[01:55:27.840 --> 01:55:28.840]   Dick's.
[01:55:28.840 --> 01:55:31.160]   That guy was a disaster, bad fit.
[01:55:31.160 --> 01:55:34.960]   He was out of there and then they went to Angela Aron's who gave up a CEO job.
[01:55:34.960 --> 01:55:37.360]   It was always kind of a fascinating choice, right?
[01:55:37.360 --> 01:55:39.160]   She gave up a job, a CEO of Burberry.
[01:55:39.160 --> 01:55:41.200]   She got paid a lot more in order to come to Apple.
[01:55:41.200 --> 01:55:44.720]   Yeah, but still you're going from being a CEO to not.
[01:55:44.720 --> 01:55:46.720]   Running the show from the chance of nobody.
[01:55:46.720 --> 01:55:50.480]   I wonder if that's that's that's big, big vision, little bond versus little vision,
[01:55:50.480 --> 01:55:51.480]   really big bond.
[01:55:51.480 --> 01:55:53.040]   Well, we'll see where she goes next, right?
[01:55:53.040 --> 01:55:55.640]   But I think maybe maybe she said, I'll give you five years.
[01:55:55.640 --> 01:56:00.440]   Maybe that was a whole store personal and professional reasons.
[01:56:00.440 --> 01:56:04.080]   Tim Cook said, I want to thank Angela for inspiring and energizing our teams over the
[01:56:04.080 --> 01:56:05.080]   past five years.
[01:56:05.080 --> 01:56:09.600]   She's been a positive transformative force for both Apple stores and the communities
[01:56:09.600 --> 01:56:10.600]   they serve.
[01:56:10.600 --> 01:56:13.360]   We wish her the very best as she begins a new chapter.
[01:56:13.360 --> 01:56:16.760]   My parents said the last five years have been the most stimulating, challenging and fulfilling
[01:56:16.760 --> 01:56:19.640]   of my career through the team's collective efforts.
[01:56:19.640 --> 01:56:21.560]   Retail has never been stronger, I would agree.
[01:56:21.560 --> 01:56:25.200]   Yeah, and she had to clean up the mess that was made by everybody.
[01:56:25.200 --> 01:56:31.960]   I would say that they, you feel like the retail is been under her guidance has been,
[01:56:31.960 --> 01:56:33.160]   you know, hitting on all cylinders.
[01:56:33.160 --> 01:56:37.880]   I mean, they really, I mean, the stores get more and more interesting and they, you know,
[01:56:37.880 --> 01:56:38.880]   it's a better experience.
[01:56:38.880 --> 01:56:41.040]   So I think she's done a good job.
[01:56:41.040 --> 01:56:42.040]   Absolutely.
[01:56:42.040 --> 01:56:45.320]   And I do wonder what's next for Angela Arance.
[01:56:45.320 --> 01:56:46.640]   But that's a breaking news.
[01:56:46.640 --> 01:56:48.400]   Just came in Apple press release.
[01:56:48.400 --> 01:56:55.400]   Arance is leaving in April, just a few months from now after five years at Apple.
[01:56:55.400 --> 01:57:01.920]   Let us, let us pause to think about what that means and prepare our picks of the week.
[01:57:01.920 --> 01:57:07.560]   And I will talk a little bit about where I hang my hat on the web and that's wordpress.com.
[01:57:07.560 --> 01:57:09.800]   Such a big fan of wordpress.com.
[01:57:09.800 --> 01:57:12.480]   How many big publications use wordpress.com?
[01:57:12.480 --> 01:57:14.040]   Maybe people don't know that.
[01:57:14.040 --> 01:57:15.160]   Courts, fortune.
[01:57:15.160 --> 01:57:19.440]   I just saw another site I was reading that is based on wordpress.com.
[01:57:19.440 --> 01:57:25.000]   I can't remember the name, but actually it could be almost anybody because 33 of the
[01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:32.120]   percent of the entire web, 33 percent of the entire web is on wordpress.
[01:57:32.120 --> 01:57:37.400]   That's a pretty astounding statistic because wordpress is great.
[01:57:37.400 --> 01:57:40.840]   I mean, there's nothing you can't do with wordpress.
[01:57:40.840 --> 01:57:43.920]   Ecommerce, publishing, or just your own personal blog.
[01:57:43.920 --> 01:57:50.360]   If you're a business, if you're an individual, you need a place on the internet that's yours.
[01:57:50.360 --> 01:57:54.320]   A place where no one can say boo to you.
[01:57:54.320 --> 01:57:58.400]   No Mark Zuckerberg can say, "Well, we don't like what you're doing."
[01:57:58.400 --> 01:58:00.360]   It's not enough to have a Facebook page.
[01:58:00.360 --> 01:58:02.280]   You should have that for your business or a Twitter feed.
[01:58:02.280 --> 01:58:03.280]   Yeah, you should have that.
[01:58:03.280 --> 01:58:05.760]   But you really need a place to link back to.
[01:58:05.760 --> 01:58:08.680]   It's your home on the web at wordpress.com.
[01:58:08.680 --> 01:58:13.640]   Great site building tools that will make your site look unique and match your aesthetic.
[01:58:13.640 --> 01:58:17.800]   They have thousands of themes, I should say.
[01:58:17.800 --> 01:58:23.540]   They do have a great team of wordpress experts to support you 24/7.
[01:58:23.540 --> 01:58:27.360]   Wordpress.com lets anyone pursue whatever it is they love by launching a site that's
[01:58:27.360 --> 01:58:31.760]   free to start and has room to grow.
[01:58:31.760 --> 01:58:35.640]   No two week trials, no hidden fees with Wordpress.
[01:58:35.640 --> 01:58:37.200]   You own your own content forever.
[01:58:37.200 --> 01:58:46.640]   You can upload images, videos, text of course, photos, and download them to at any time.
[01:58:46.640 --> 01:58:48.960]   It will grow with you no matter where you want to be.
[01:58:48.960 --> 01:58:53.320]   I actually started with the free tier 12 years ago, worked my way up.
[01:58:53.320 --> 01:58:56.640]   Now I have a business plan and I just love it.
[01:58:56.640 --> 01:58:58.800]   I just love it.
[01:58:58.800 --> 01:59:03.120]   It's your home.
[01:59:03.120 --> 01:59:10.480]   I love it.
[01:59:10.480 --> 01:59:37.200]   It's your home.
[01:59:37.200 --> 01:59:43.720]   Let us know.
[01:59:43.720 --> 01:59:49.560]   The first one is the -- it looks like you're having a dental procedure at this point.
[01:59:49.560 --> 01:59:52.560]   It's something called the Luna display which is not here.
[01:59:52.560 --> 01:59:56.880]   I should disclaimer they are a sponsor of some of my podcasts but I actually bought on their
[01:59:56.880 --> 02:00:00.360]   Kickstarter before they were a sponsor.
[02:00:00.360 --> 02:00:03.200]   What I find fascinating about this product if you haven't heard about it is it's from
[02:00:03.200 --> 02:00:09.040]   the same people who have done a bunch of other things involving using your Mac as a graphics
[02:00:09.040 --> 02:00:12.320]   tablet via the iPad and they built some great tools for it.
[02:00:12.320 --> 02:00:14.240]   I used Duet to do this.
[02:00:14.240 --> 02:00:17.960]   This is interesting because there's a hardware component you plug it into either a display
[02:00:17.960 --> 02:00:23.280]   port or USB-C port but what has happened since the Mac Mini was released is that a lot of
[02:00:23.280 --> 02:00:27.560]   people who love their iPad but also use a Mac have bought a Mac Mini and plugged one of
[02:00:27.560 --> 02:00:33.680]   these things in and anywhere in their house they can get a very low latency, very high
[02:00:33.680 --> 02:00:37.920]   quality Mac image on their iPad.
[02:00:37.920 --> 02:00:39.760]   So what is the range on this?
[02:00:39.760 --> 02:00:41.800]   If it's on your local Wi-Fi network it works.
[02:00:41.800 --> 02:00:43.200]   You can't take it out of the network.
[02:00:43.200 --> 02:00:47.000]   It doesn't have to be anywhere in the house.
[02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:48.920]   It doesn't have to do a software keyboard.
[02:00:48.920 --> 02:00:53.680]   I still have screens which is the app I use for remote access and I use that if I need
[02:00:53.680 --> 02:00:57.840]   to type on a software keyboard but if you've got a hardware keyboard, if you've got that
[02:00:57.840 --> 02:01:02.320]   keyboard that comes with the iPad Pro, people are starting to use this product for what
[02:01:02.320 --> 02:01:08.640]   it was not intended for which is as kind of like turning a Mac Mini as a good example
[02:01:08.640 --> 02:01:13.160]   into kind of a headless Mac and then you just use your iPad.
[02:01:13.160 --> 02:01:14.920]   It really works.
[02:01:14.920 --> 02:01:19.840]   I'll do things like airdrop myself things where I'll just turn on airdrop and drag a
[02:01:19.840 --> 02:01:24.160]   file in and then hold my iPad kind of near the Mac Mini and the file comes over and anyway
[02:01:24.160 --> 02:01:28.920]   it is so full disclosure they have sponsored some of my podcasts but I bought one before
[02:01:28.920 --> 02:01:33.560]   that and I think it's fascinating that a lot of people who are really into the iPad now
[02:01:33.560 --> 02:01:37.660]   still need access to the Mac and are kind of using this as their Mac access point is
[02:01:37.660 --> 02:01:43.120]   via this sort of screen control remote control and you just touch the screen to interact
[02:01:43.120 --> 02:01:44.120]   with the interface.
[02:01:44.120 --> 02:01:46.800]   So if you want to pull down a menu you suddenly the Mac is a touch.
[02:01:46.800 --> 02:01:47.800]   Oh my goodness, a touch.
[02:01:47.800 --> 02:01:49.800]   You mean the Mac interface actually works on.
[02:01:49.800 --> 02:01:50.800]   On a touch screen is shocking.
[02:01:50.800 --> 02:01:52.880]   Use the applicants with it.
[02:01:52.880 --> 02:01:57.040]   The other product and the one that I brought with me is this is a stand from a company
[02:01:57.040 --> 02:02:01.040]   called Clear Look which I had never heard before I bought this stand.
[02:02:01.040 --> 02:02:02.520]   They sell it on Amazon.
[02:02:02.520 --> 02:02:09.200]   I am always pursuing new iPad stands because I enjoy using an external mechanical keyboard
[02:02:09.200 --> 02:02:10.200]   with my iPad.
[02:02:10.200 --> 02:02:11.600]   It's great to be expensive segments.
[02:02:11.600 --> 02:02:16.520]   I stand up oftentimes at the bar in my kitchen and write articles.
[02:02:16.520 --> 02:02:17.520]   I love this stand.
[02:02:17.520 --> 02:02:20.000]   It is rotatable.
[02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:21.560]   So of course you can write articles.
[02:02:21.560 --> 02:02:25.480]   I love writing articles in vertical mode instead of horizontal.
[02:02:25.480 --> 02:02:26.480]   It's very nice.
[02:02:26.480 --> 02:02:30.200]   But if you're using a side by side multitasking you can do it in horizontal as well.
[02:02:30.200 --> 02:02:31.200]   You just turn it.
[02:02:31.200 --> 02:02:33.000]   It tilts.
[02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.240]   I've written about a couple stands like this.
[02:02:35.240 --> 02:02:41.120]   What makes this stand different and why my friend Mike Hurley recommended it to me is
[02:02:41.120 --> 02:02:44.360]   it is 18 inches of height that you can get.
[02:02:44.360 --> 02:02:49.200]   So many iPad stands are so low down it's very stable because there's kind of a heavy base.
[02:02:49.200 --> 02:02:53.480]   This is the 12.9 iPad that I'm using here.
[02:02:53.480 --> 02:02:57.440]   So many of them are so low that you can use them but you end up hunched over and it's
[02:02:57.440 --> 02:02:58.440]   no good.
[02:02:58.440 --> 02:03:02.320]   This one you can get up at a good ergonomic height and use it.
[02:03:02.320 --> 02:03:03.960]   I use it all the time.
[02:03:03.960 --> 02:03:04.960]   Also I've got this Leopold.
[02:03:04.960 --> 02:03:08.480]   I got this Leopold mechanical keyboard here.
[02:03:08.480 --> 02:03:10.080]   One of the unstated things that...
[02:03:10.080 --> 02:03:11.080]   Which kind is this?
[02:03:11.080 --> 02:03:12.080]   This is a Leopold FC660.
[02:03:12.080 --> 02:03:13.920]   I like its name.
[02:03:13.920 --> 02:03:16.920]   It's a little mini keyboard but one of the nice things that I hadn't really thought about
[02:03:16.920 --> 02:03:22.440]   before about the new iPad Pro is USB-C even though yeah it doesn't do a lot of things
[02:03:22.440 --> 02:03:24.120]   in terms of storage and all of that.
[02:03:24.120 --> 02:03:28.600]   It has enough power coming out of that port now that pretty much any USB device that's
[02:03:28.600 --> 02:03:32.160]   bus power will work with it including every keyboard I own.
[02:03:32.160 --> 02:03:34.360]   So this I don't have to do anything.
[02:03:34.360 --> 02:03:35.560]   I can just plug this in.
[02:03:35.560 --> 02:03:39.040]   I'm using a dongle here to do it and it works great.
[02:03:39.040 --> 02:03:40.040]   It works just fine.
[02:03:40.040 --> 02:03:43.680]   So this is my setup at home when I want to take a break from my iMac.
[02:03:43.680 --> 02:03:47.320]   I just use this Clearlook stand and the big...
[02:03:47.320 --> 02:03:49.520]   It's hard wired to connect it which is awesome.
[02:03:49.520 --> 02:03:53.520]   Yeah you can use a Bluetooth keyboard if you want but this is harder to find good mechanical
[02:03:53.520 --> 02:03:57.440]   Bluetooth keyboards and I have a bunch of these USB ones laying around so I just use
[02:03:57.440 --> 02:03:58.440]   those.
[02:03:58.440 --> 02:04:00.360]   Do those stands break down well?
[02:04:00.360 --> 02:04:01.360]   This one...
[02:04:01.360 --> 02:04:02.360]   Well I mean it's going to have the big...
[02:04:02.360 --> 02:04:04.000]   I wish he means can I put it in my suitcase.
[02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:05.960]   Yeah yeah it's this one doesn't...
[02:04:05.960 --> 02:04:06.960]   You can unscrew it.
[02:04:06.960 --> 02:04:09.800]   You can actually take the base off of it so you could do that.
[02:04:09.800 --> 02:04:10.800]   Cool.
[02:04:10.800 --> 02:04:11.800]   Yeah.
[02:04:11.800 --> 02:04:13.280]   I might get some of these Leopolds too.
[02:04:13.280 --> 02:04:17.640]   We were talking about the code keyboards and the DOS keyboard and this is a pretty nice
[02:04:17.640 --> 02:04:18.640]   keyboard.
[02:04:18.640 --> 02:04:20.840]   I'm using a different mechanical keyboard at my Mac now.
[02:04:20.840 --> 02:04:23.960]   This is my old one so I've kind of repurposed it to the iPad.
[02:04:23.960 --> 02:04:26.320]   There are a bunch of good mechanical keyboards out there.
[02:04:26.320 --> 02:04:27.320]   I have a bunch of keyboards on there.
[02:04:27.320 --> 02:04:28.320]   Yeah it's a problem.
[02:04:28.320 --> 02:04:30.160]   It's a good problem to have.
[02:04:30.160 --> 02:04:31.160]   Yeah.
[02:04:31.160 --> 02:04:32.160]   Chair Brown.
[02:04:32.160 --> 02:04:34.760]   I think I might use my IBM and keyboard.
[02:04:34.760 --> 02:04:38.160]   There is nothing like using an old style clicky keyboard with an iPad.
[02:04:38.160 --> 02:04:41.120]   You practically have to raise your arm to type with it.
[02:04:41.120 --> 02:04:42.120]   It is amazing.
[02:04:42.120 --> 02:04:43.120]   Such to keep travel.
[02:04:43.120 --> 02:04:44.120]   Very nice.
[02:04:44.120 --> 02:04:45.840]   Okay I just bought a lot of stuff I shouldn't.
[02:04:45.840 --> 02:04:46.840]   You're welcome.
[02:04:46.840 --> 02:04:48.320]   I think you just bought...
[02:04:48.320 --> 02:04:50.080]   I just made me buy a Mac Mini.
[02:04:50.080 --> 02:04:52.760]   That's the thing that's really scary.
[02:04:52.760 --> 02:04:57.040]   Because now I'm thinking I want to use a Mac Mini anywhere in the house.
[02:04:57.040 --> 02:04:58.600]   You can use it with any Mac.
[02:04:58.600 --> 02:04:59.600]   I guess I could just...
[02:04:59.600 --> 02:05:00.600]   I already have an iMac Pro.
[02:05:00.600 --> 02:05:01.600]   Yeah.
[02:05:01.600 --> 02:05:02.600]   Could I plug into the back of that?
[02:05:02.600 --> 02:05:05.120]   Yeah the challenge there is that that screen is so much larger than your iPad screen.
[02:05:05.120 --> 02:05:06.120]   Yeah.
[02:05:06.120 --> 02:05:07.920]   It's going to have to be scaled down.
[02:05:07.920 --> 02:05:09.920]   Oh.
[02:05:09.920 --> 02:05:12.240]   How big a screen does the Luna display support?
[02:05:12.240 --> 02:05:13.240]   Any size.
[02:05:13.240 --> 02:05:14.240]   Any size.
[02:05:14.240 --> 02:05:16.960]   So that 12.9 iPad Pro will do a wonderful job.
[02:05:16.960 --> 02:05:22.160]   Hey maybe I'll just get one of these and see how well it works in the iMac.
[02:05:22.160 --> 02:05:23.160]   I can try.
[02:05:23.160 --> 02:05:26.640]   It's a very clever thing because what they're doing is they're fooling the unlike a lot
[02:05:26.640 --> 02:05:27.760]   of the software solutions.
[02:05:27.760 --> 02:05:32.480]   The hardware dongle basically fools the Mac into thinking that it's got an external monitor
[02:05:32.480 --> 02:05:35.680]   attached and that turns on all the hardware acceleration.
[02:05:35.680 --> 02:05:38.320]   Which is why it works better.
[02:05:38.320 --> 02:05:39.320]   Right.
[02:05:39.320 --> 02:05:42.800]   All right.
[02:05:42.800 --> 02:05:43.800]   I broke Leo.
[02:05:43.800 --> 02:05:48.000]   You can use it with mini display port too if you had a really old Mac liner.
[02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:51.160]   Yes I tried that with my Macbook Air and it did not want to go into random mode.
[02:05:51.160 --> 02:05:52.160]   Not a good choice.
[02:05:52.160 --> 02:05:53.160]   Shocker.
[02:05:53.160 --> 02:05:54.160]   Not a good choice.
[02:05:54.160 --> 02:05:55.160]   But it did work.
[02:05:55.160 --> 02:05:56.160]   I'm buying one.
[02:05:56.160 --> 02:05:57.160]   Okay.
[02:05:57.160 --> 02:05:58.160]   So that's 180 bucks you cost me.
[02:05:58.160 --> 02:05:59.160]   All right.
[02:05:59.160 --> 02:06:00.160]   You're welcome.
[02:06:00.160 --> 02:06:01.160]   All right.
[02:06:01.160 --> 02:06:05.000]   I know he's going to have something inexpensive like Coca-Cola or something.
[02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:08.400]   Yeah I do have something cheap.
[02:06:08.400 --> 02:06:10.760]   This is actually not unrelated to the iPad.
[02:06:10.760 --> 02:06:15.200]   A lot of people, especially artists that I know they love the Apple pencil.
[02:06:15.200 --> 02:06:17.560]   They love the art tools on the iPad.
[02:06:17.560 --> 02:06:22.240]   What they don't like is drawing on a sheet of like slick glass.
[02:06:22.240 --> 02:06:25.240]   And a friend of mine who is a professional artist Chris Eliopolis.
[02:06:25.240 --> 02:06:30.720]   As a matter of fact he has a brand new book out today in a series of kids books called
[02:06:30.720 --> 02:06:33.600]   "Ordinary People Change the World."
[02:06:33.600 --> 02:06:38.960]   He drew the book "I Am Billie Jean King" which is being released today.
[02:06:38.960 --> 02:06:39.960]   Tells her story.
[02:06:39.960 --> 02:06:42.520]   How many times do I have said that?
[02:06:42.520 --> 02:06:43.520]   Yep.
[02:06:43.520 --> 02:06:44.520]   And tells all the answers.
[02:06:44.520 --> 02:06:45.920]   He's drawn all these books in the series.
[02:06:45.920 --> 02:06:49.840]   But basically to communicate that this is not just like someone like me who just doodles
[02:06:49.840 --> 02:06:50.920]   for fun.
[02:06:50.920 --> 02:06:56.320]   He started recommending this screen cover called Paper Like that he says absolutely
[02:06:56.320 --> 02:06:58.480]   just makes his it really really helps out.
[02:06:58.480 --> 02:07:03.280]   It really makes the surface of the iPad underneath the Apple pencil feel like he's
[02:07:03.280 --> 02:07:05.360]   drawing on paper again.
[02:07:05.360 --> 02:07:07.080]   He absolutely loves them.
[02:07:07.080 --> 02:07:11.840]   You get two for something like $33.
[02:07:11.840 --> 02:07:16.280]   I assume like most screen covers, yes it's two but they give you two because they assume
[02:07:16.280 --> 02:07:19.160]   you're going to screw up one when you try to apply it.
[02:07:19.160 --> 02:07:25.120]   But it does give you all the stuff that you need to actually apply the thing correctly.
[02:07:25.120 --> 02:07:29.400]   And so I feel what he's saying.
[02:07:29.400 --> 02:07:33.240]   There are a lot of people I know like myself included that I love these tools.
[02:07:33.240 --> 02:07:41.240]   But there's something about like the texture feedback of like a pencil against paper that
[02:07:41.240 --> 02:07:44.880]   they have something with a little bit of grit, a little bit of teeth to it has got to really
[02:07:44.880 --> 02:07:45.880]   really help.
[02:07:45.880 --> 02:07:50.040]   And for $33 for pack of two it's got to be if nothing else it'll keep the glare off
[02:07:50.040 --> 02:07:51.040]   your screen.
[02:07:51.040 --> 02:07:53.360]   It'll protect your screen a little bit.
[02:07:53.360 --> 02:08:00.320]   And it has the the thumb of endorsement of superstar superstar artist Chris Iliopolis.
[02:08:00.320 --> 02:08:07.320]   So what else do you want?
[02:08:07.320 --> 02:08:12.520]   I always thought that Apple would eventually change the stylus just a little bit so that
[02:08:12.520 --> 02:08:14.520]   we would get more of that bite.
[02:08:14.520 --> 02:08:15.520]   But they never did.
[02:08:15.520 --> 02:08:18.720]   Or at least give you like interchangeable tips for like different kind of feel.
[02:08:18.720 --> 02:08:19.720]   Didn't they promise interchangeable tips?
[02:08:19.720 --> 02:08:20.720]   That's what they're there.
[02:08:20.720 --> 02:08:23.720]   Well they swappable swappable just in case one words.
[02:08:23.720 --> 02:08:24.720]   But like a different kind.
[02:08:24.720 --> 02:08:25.720]   But I thought they promised you.
[02:08:25.720 --> 02:08:26.720]   I thought so too.
[02:08:26.720 --> 02:08:29.720]   Does the centique feel a little more like paper or some of the other.
[02:08:29.720 --> 02:08:30.720]   What do you have?
[02:08:30.720 --> 02:08:31.720]   I don't draw my iPad.
[02:08:31.720 --> 02:08:33.400]   I have one of the best.
[02:08:33.400 --> 02:08:38.080]   I want to thank Aaron Mayler who was I was texting back and forth and he said he goes
[02:08:38.080 --> 02:08:42.400]   oh I just downloaded this and he's like holy smokes it works.
[02:08:42.400 --> 02:08:47.120]   And so this is one of the best uses of AR I've seen in quite some time.
[02:08:47.120 --> 02:08:50.440]   And it's the new update to the Warby Parker.
[02:08:50.440 --> 02:08:51.440]   Have you seen this?
[02:08:51.440 --> 02:08:52.440]   The Warby Parker.
[02:08:52.440 --> 02:08:53.440]   I glass it.
[02:08:53.440 --> 02:08:56.280]   So the biggest problem with Warby Parker is you is you're ordering all these.
[02:08:56.280 --> 02:08:57.280]   You have to order a bunch of boxes.
[02:08:57.280 --> 02:09:06.120]   So they're now using your 3D camera on your iPhone to match your.
[02:09:06.120 --> 02:09:07.120]   No.
[02:09:07.120 --> 02:09:08.120]   It is AR and it works.
[02:09:08.120 --> 02:09:09.120]   Look at this.
[02:09:09.120 --> 02:09:10.120]   So it looks like your glasses.
[02:09:10.120 --> 02:09:11.120]   Oh that's cool.
[02:09:11.120 --> 02:09:12.120]   I can turn my head.
[02:09:12.120 --> 02:09:13.120]   You're wearing glasses.
[02:09:13.120 --> 02:09:15.120]   And it's like I can say oh and then you can just go like this.
[02:09:15.120 --> 02:09:16.600]   Oh I'd like to try different pair of glasses.
[02:09:16.600 --> 02:09:18.000]   That's like really good.
[02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:19.440]   I wish there was some way we could show that.
[02:09:19.440 --> 02:09:20.440]   You'd have to come over here.
[02:09:20.440 --> 02:09:21.440]   Give it to me.
[02:09:21.440 --> 02:09:22.640]   I can try them right?
[02:09:22.640 --> 02:09:23.640]   Yeah.
[02:09:23.640 --> 02:09:24.640]   I can try them on.
[02:09:24.640 --> 02:09:25.640]   Let me see here.
[02:09:25.640 --> 02:09:26.640]   Let me see.
[02:09:26.640 --> 02:09:27.640]   I can try them for me.
[02:09:27.640 --> 02:09:31.080]   Just swipe over.
[02:09:31.080 --> 02:09:34.320]   These are the Benson's.
[02:09:34.320 --> 02:09:37.200]   I look like Benson in these.
[02:09:37.200 --> 02:09:38.200]   Do they have any?
[02:09:38.200 --> 02:09:39.200]   Oh that's a good look.
[02:09:39.200 --> 02:09:40.200]   I think that's good.
[02:09:40.200 --> 02:09:41.200]   I look like an intellectual.
[02:09:41.200 --> 02:09:42.200]   Right?
[02:09:42.200 --> 02:09:44.400]   But I mean it's a defendant.
[02:09:44.400 --> 02:09:50.560]   But the thing is is taking advantage of really understanding where you're a defendant.
[02:09:50.560 --> 02:09:53.120]   I take the fifth on that.
[02:09:53.120 --> 02:09:56.360]   I didn't know.
[02:09:56.360 --> 02:09:57.360]   I don't remember.
[02:09:57.360 --> 02:09:58.960]   Oh I want some Haskell glasses.
[02:09:58.960 --> 02:10:00.360]   Do they help me program?
[02:10:00.360 --> 02:10:01.360]   Those are nice.
[02:10:01.360 --> 02:10:02.360]   There's a guy named.
[02:10:02.360 --> 02:10:05.560]   If you're trying your head a little bit you're really going to see the tracking.
[02:10:05.560 --> 02:10:06.560]   I mean it is.
[02:10:06.560 --> 02:10:08.560]   Yeah there's reflection too.
[02:10:08.560 --> 02:10:11.200]   There's like the highlights off the top.
[02:10:11.200 --> 02:10:15.520]   It really I mean it is really really really well done.
[02:10:15.520 --> 02:10:17.520]   These make me look like Gary Lewis.
[02:10:17.520 --> 02:10:18.520]   Nice.
[02:10:18.520 --> 02:10:21.640]   Yeah so a good use AR.
[02:10:21.640 --> 02:10:22.640]   Yeah.
[02:10:22.640 --> 02:10:23.840]   This is called their virtual try on.
[02:10:23.840 --> 02:10:24.840]   Or be used to be a sponsor.
[02:10:24.840 --> 02:10:26.880]   They're not anymore so I don't have to say that.
[02:10:26.880 --> 02:10:29.240]   Or be Parker.
[02:10:29.240 --> 02:10:31.840]   My problem is I have a giant head.
[02:10:31.840 --> 02:10:34.160]   And so most glasses kind of look too small.
[02:10:34.160 --> 02:10:38.160]   I mean these are the I hope this is not like stretching the glasses frame to make it look
[02:10:38.160 --> 02:10:42.680]   like well I may be but I think that it they don't they don't have to they would be able
[02:10:42.680 --> 02:10:43.680]   to do it.
[02:10:43.680 --> 02:10:49.760]   Also I know so the temples of the frames don't actually plunge strictly into your skull.
[02:10:49.760 --> 02:10:50.760]   Yeah.
[02:10:50.760 --> 02:10:53.760]   Well you don't need to know what it looks like over your ear or maybe you do.
[02:10:53.760 --> 02:10:54.760]   I don't know.
[02:10:54.760 --> 02:10:58.280]   I'm sure that they had an issue with the tracking was not quite you know the ears are going
[02:10:58.280 --> 02:10:59.280]   to be.
[02:10:59.280 --> 02:11:02.880]   Does this make me look even if even if you're going to get four and check it I think that
[02:11:02.880 --> 02:11:08.920]   your is great it would be it's just really the thirst and thirst and look.
[02:11:08.920 --> 02:11:13.200]   It doesn't show you how good you look when you whip them off dramatically to make a point.
[02:11:13.200 --> 02:11:14.200]   Exactly.
[02:11:14.200 --> 02:11:18.080]   You can't but try it.
[02:11:18.080 --> 02:11:20.960]   I am not going to take this anymore.
[02:11:20.960 --> 02:11:24.320]   Point point thirst and wide.
[02:11:24.320 --> 02:11:26.040]   I see I need the thirst and wide.
[02:11:26.040 --> 02:11:27.040]   That's what I need.
[02:11:27.040 --> 02:11:33.840]   Does it help you does it will also show you what you look like with contacts.
[02:11:33.840 --> 02:11:34.840]   Very nice.
[02:11:34.840 --> 02:11:39.480]   That's Warby Parker and it's it's actually a really great glasses store by mail that
[02:11:39.480 --> 02:11:42.320]   are a lot less expensive because they're not all but like sodica.
[02:11:42.320 --> 02:11:43.320]   Yeah.
[02:11:43.320 --> 02:11:44.320]   And they're really good.
[02:11:44.320 --> 02:11:45.320]   Yeah.
[02:11:45.320 --> 02:11:46.520]   My daughter is a Warby customer.
[02:11:46.520 --> 02:11:48.000]   Very cool.
[02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:51.520]   I was committed to changing to worry Parker specifically because I'm tired of going and
[02:11:51.520 --> 02:11:56.040]   paying incredible sums of money for a nonplistic crisis for plastic.
[02:11:56.040 --> 02:11:57.040]   Right.
[02:11:57.040 --> 02:12:00.200]   And so but I but I kept on going oh I don't know which ones I want to order and when
[02:12:00.200 --> 02:12:03.200]   this case when when Aaron sent this to me the other day or yesterday I was just like
[02:12:03.200 --> 02:12:04.200]   oh I nice.
[02:12:04.200 --> 02:12:05.200]   Now I'm done.
[02:12:05.200 --> 02:12:06.200]   Thank you.
[02:12:06.200 --> 02:12:10.040]   Probably within the next couple weeks you'll see me with Warby does do prescription sunglasses
[02:12:10.040 --> 02:12:14.160]   Patrick I have prescription warbies that I wear and I love them.
[02:12:14.160 --> 02:12:15.160]   They also do monocles.
[02:12:15.160 --> 02:12:16.160]   Oh.
[02:12:16.160 --> 02:12:17.960]   Do they have a monocle try on because I don't know.
[02:12:17.960 --> 02:12:19.960]   I use my Warby monocle frequently.
[02:12:19.960 --> 02:12:20.960]   Not even.
[02:12:20.960 --> 02:12:21.960]   That's it.
[02:12:21.960 --> 02:12:24.400]   I mean done.
[02:12:24.400 --> 02:12:27.880]   I don't know if there's a past nay option however.

[02:13:34.280 --> 02:13:35.280]   I think so.
[02:13:35.280 --> 02:13:36.280]   Unclothes.
[02:13:36.280 --> 02:13:37.280]   It's a concrete movie.
[02:13:37.280 --> 02:13:39.880]   It's a big box.
[02:13:39.880 --> 02:13:40.880]   Nice.

[02:13:57.760 --> 02:13:59.560]   It's pretty much how it works.
[02:13:59.560 --> 02:14:00.560]   Yeah.
[02:14:00.560 --> 02:14:01.560]   Thank you, Andrew.
[02:14:01.560 --> 02:14:05.240]   We're trying to get a fitting war is happening, but it doesn't work yet.
[02:14:05.240 --> 02:14:07.520]   I bid $200.
[02:14:07.520 --> 02:14:10.400]   We are all available for purchase by Spotify.
[02:14:10.400 --> 02:14:11.400]   That's right.
[02:14:11.400 --> 02:14:12.400]   That's right.
[02:14:12.400 --> 02:14:13.400]   Leo.
[02:14:13.400 --> 02:14:16.640]   Take my Android podcast and go to relay FM.
[02:14:16.640 --> 02:14:18.760]   Oh, that's a good idea.
[02:14:18.760 --> 02:14:20.200]   You should definitely do that.
[02:14:20.200 --> 02:14:21.200]   Don't.
[02:14:21.200 --> 02:14:22.200]   Yeah.
[02:14:22.200 --> 02:14:24.320]   You're supposed to say counter off or counter off.
[02:14:24.320 --> 02:14:25.320]   I apologize.
[02:14:25.320 --> 02:14:26.680]   I didn't realize that was how it worked.
[02:14:26.680 --> 02:14:28.760]   I'm sorry, Andy.
[02:14:28.760 --> 02:14:31.280]   Don't ever threaten to take Mac break weekly somewhere else.
[02:14:31.280 --> 02:14:32.920]   So that would be my heart.
[02:14:32.920 --> 02:14:33.920]   Break my heart.
[02:14:33.920 --> 02:14:35.800]   Hurley doesn't get this show.
[02:14:35.800 --> 02:14:37.040]   Thank you, Andy.
[02:14:37.040 --> 02:14:38.360]   Thank you, Alex.
[02:14:38.360 --> 02:14:39.360]   Thank you, Jason.
[02:14:39.360 --> 02:14:41.240]   Most importantly, thank you all for being here.
[02:14:41.240 --> 02:14:42.880]   We do this show every Tuesday.
[02:14:42.880 --> 02:14:46.440]   We're on 11 AM Pacific, 2 PM Eastern time, 1800 UTC.
[02:14:46.440 --> 02:14:48.160]   We have a live stream.
[02:14:48.160 --> 02:14:53.360]   Unlike all those other podcast networks, we have video.
[02:14:53.360 --> 02:14:57.000]   We were stupid enough to turn this into a TV station.
[02:14:57.000 --> 02:15:00.440]   So if you have to wear pants, that's why you have to wear pants when you're on this
[02:15:00.440 --> 02:15:03.000]   show, go to twit.tv/live.
[02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:06.640]   You can watch and listen if you insist to a live stream.
[02:15:06.640 --> 02:15:11.240]   And if you are on the live stream, you really ought to be in the chatroom at IRC.twit.tv.
[02:15:11.240 --> 02:15:16.440]   That's all the other kids watching live or at least a good portion thereof.
[02:15:16.440 --> 02:15:22.760]   As with those other guys, we also offer downloadable, I call it on demand.
[02:15:22.760 --> 02:15:31.520]   You might call it a podcast at our website, twit.tv/mbw for Mac break weekly, twit.tv/mbw.
[02:15:31.520 --> 02:15:39.640]   And while you may be searching for some other show, material or the incomparable on your
[02:15:39.640 --> 02:15:41.040]   podcast client.
[02:15:41.040 --> 02:15:44.820]   You could also search for a Mac break weekly and subscribe to it that way you get it each
[02:15:44.820 --> 02:15:49.240]   and every Tuesday of the minutes available, hot off the presses and you would never lack
[02:15:49.240 --> 02:15:52.720]   for something fabulous to listen to.
[02:15:52.720 --> 02:15:53.720]   Right?
[02:15:53.720 --> 02:15:57.120]   Thanks for being here but now I'm sorry to say it's time to get back to work because
[02:15:57.120 --> 02:15:59.160]   break time is over!
[02:15:59.160 --> 02:16:01.520]   Bye bye.
[02:16:01.520 --> 02:16:02.480]   "Krikey, krikey, krieeey!"
[02:16:02.480 --> 02:16:03.480]   "Krikey!
[02:16:03.480 --> 02:16:04.480]   Krikey!"
[02:16:04.480 --> 02:16:13.120]   "Krikey! Krikey! Krikey!"
