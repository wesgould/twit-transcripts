[00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:43.660]   Okay, but for historic reasons we call it Mac break weekly and that's Renee Richie who's laughing right now
[00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:48.780]   He's got he's at i more calm very smart. You put no word from Apple at all in there
[00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.780]   Just an eye but now they're dumping the i-lego. I should have gone with Apple logo more
[00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:58.140]   But then I would just know there's no good answer for this can't win no from Montreal has the weather
[00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.980]   It's slowly getting better
[00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.020]   Winter is still here not patio weather yet
[00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.100]   It is if you're if you want to come out of your igloo and take a couple steps out and chill your beverage nicely
[00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.100]   It's beautiful patio weather fit it on
[00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:22.580]   Beverage and from Rwanda mr. Alex Lindsey of pixel core calm and he's in his classroom in Rwanda
[00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.700]   Yes, kill golly
[00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:31.020]   Yeah, I mean golly for the next 10 days so lots of beans and classes and how much are you got a little snow there and kill golly
[00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.700]   You know, there's not a lot of snow here
[00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.540]   low low in the lower 60s and high in the
[00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:44.620]   Lower 80s and it's kind of just a nice and humid little rain in the afternoon. That's pretty much it. It's probably that way
[00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.940]   You're round isn't that pretty much it's pretty much the same the whole time
[00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.340]   It's just matter whether it rains more or not. I mean we're pretty close to the equator
[00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.020]   So Singapore's like that. It just yeah, it never changes
[00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.180]   Yeah, it's a pretty big shift
[00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:03.020]   I was driving through freezing rain to get to the airport, you know from my flights got canceled over the weekend from Hilton
[00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:07.220]   Had I thought I'd go for a warm vacation that turned out to be very cold and then and then
[00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.620]   Drove through it. So it was quite a thing. I got on the plane
[00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.420]   It was freezing got off the plane and it was cozy nice
[00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:19.500]   Yeah, but you know really the king of this is the man who has is is in snowbound New England
[00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:26.700]   Mr. Andy and not co from the Shakira. So we are attempting to shake ourselves from our icy chains and reclaim the freedom
[00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.780]   That is our birthright as the Patriots the founders of our freedom of America more tea in the harbor, sir
[00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.820]   And we threw the tea in the harbor just bounce off and skid that would be an all empty gesture at best
[00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:42.260]   I saw pictures of Niagara Falls frozen. Wow. I thought Wow. Yeah, that's that's
[00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:48.340]   Somebody did somebody did some like drone flights over Boston likes of a Boston common and Fenway Park
[00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.220]   And it really does look like oh, so that's what's gonna look like in
[00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:56.340]   Years when we're all dead and now and then another dinosaur is reclaimed after
[00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.700]   After 100 inches of snow. It looks like abandoned
[00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.660]   Man here it is
[00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.580]   By drone. I love these drones. I gotta tell you
[00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:11.660]   We get such great footage. So did you get any while we're watching?
[00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.660]   Oh
[00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:18.620]   Doesn't that look like fun while we're watching
[00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:27.100]   I guess probably see Ben Franklin wandering that is speaking hell that's like one of the oldest parts of John Hancock and there's the bunker Hill Memorial
[00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:32.220]   This is what I can't I think it's amazing what we could do with public art and that's these guys
[00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:37.260]   George Washington there is my stand one of my standard test shots only there's normally not
[00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:39.900]   Greener. Yeah, yep
[00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.380]   Just thinking how cool it would have been to have a drone in the in the revolution
[00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:48.940]   Mmm, I want to think of these things. You know the footage why others just think of the footage ramparts, you know
[00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:50.940]   Did you Andrew did you get a?
[00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:57.860]   invitation from the the fruit company I did not I believe Apple will know that Logan was gonna be shut down this weekend anyway
[00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.900]   We're getting another storm. So they they decided to be proactive and make sure that they don't even tempt me with an
[00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.740]   Nobody from Boston got an invitation this year. That's that's what I keep telling right?
[00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.620]   You know you're weird because you're on and off we were talking about this
[00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.540]   on
[00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:19.940]   Twitter tweet I think that you're with Jason Snell who's going of course and I thought you know
[00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:24.900]   One thing that I thought was kind of cool is that even Joe Jason Snell is no longer editor chief of Mac world, you know
[00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.260]   You know he's a blogger now six colors his blog
[00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:34.020]   They still invite him which I think is awesome. Yeah, and he said it really is about the relationship not about the publication
[00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:39.700]   But he said you're not a case because sometimes you get invited sometimes you don't and that's a tip
[00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:40.660]   Yeah, and that's well
[00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:45.740]   That's why I think a lot of people make a mistake of thinking that there's like a formal blacklist or there's a good list
[00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.300]   I'm not even nice or or or not. He listened a good and a nice list
[00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.380]   There are just a lot of variables most of which you won't understand
[00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:57.740]   And so again every every time there's an event I anticipate maybe getting invited
[00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.980]   Maybe not it's either way I can do my job. So it's really not a problem Renee you did in fact
[00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:04.580]   I know you and serenity are coming down for the yes, sir
[00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.300]   It's exciting
[00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.700]   You're there they're taking mercy on me and getting me out of this one. Yeah
[00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:13.460]   Yeah, thank goodness
[00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.420]   The I was actually want to find the the invitation
[00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:22.540]   I want to find an invitation that has the text on it because a lot of so did yours
[00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:26.260]   They'll just look like that it to head of the bottom. It's that spring. Yeah. Yeah, there it is
[00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:33.620]   So I've seen some I guess maybe some publications put that information up spring forward. It says with what looks like the NBC peacock
[00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:37.620]   Must see TV and
[00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:43.380]   Apple will hold a press event March 9th. You're invited. It's the Herbo Boina Center, which is a smallish place
[00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:45.380]   That's what the iPad was announced
[00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:47.780]   and
[00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:49.780]   And it will be Monday
[00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:51.420]   Yep
[00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:55.020]   Tony empecific, I think given spring forward it is the day after
[00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:00.300]   We enter summertime here in the United States, but I think given the name that the title spring
[00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:05.220]   That's it assume it's a watch isn't that when clocks go back? I think spring
[00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:10.020]   But spring I believe is March 20th. We've been very focused on that date of late. Oh, I thought
[00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:17.140]   Yes spring is March 20th. I'm sorry, but I summertime we go into our daylight savings time on March 8th
[00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:21.660]   I was told as I'm completely exactly right. Yeah according to no no less a source than Google
[00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:28.020]   I'm Sunday at you search for and a day like savings. You get a card that says Sunday March 8th 2 a.m
[00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:31.900]   And I'm and I'm bitter about that twice a year. Yeah, I know like
[00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:36.220]   Why why was it was it you who said I just want the Sun?
[00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:41.220]   Overhead at noon no matter what time of year. I just don't want to change my watch
[00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:48.620]   I don't want to figure out what my offsets are I don't want it because they're different countries are different offs that I don't
[00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:54.940]   Know it's Sunday for us, but I don't know if it's Sunday everywhere is it Sunday in Wales that you change your time? Yes
[00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:59.860]   Well, the Welshman in front of me so I would know
[00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:04.020]   The worst the worst thing is like the worst thing is like when you're flying
[00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:08.740]   I'm glad when the I'm glad that I don't have to at least fly to San Francisco on
[00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:13.820]   Like daylight savings day because I want to go clocks go back because I had like I had a conference
[00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:20.140]   I went to like three years in a row in which my travel day was that Sunday and so I was also like flying three time zones west
[00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:22.540]   So I would lose like four hours
[00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:28.420]   And I was just an absolute and because of Sunday flight schedules the only way to get a flight out
[00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:31.420]   That's gonna really work is gonna be to leave the house at six or seven in the morning
[00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:34.180]   And there'd then to be there'd be a reception at 8 p.m
[00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:38.260]   And I would be an absolute frickin wreck and I have to speak in front of like
[00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:43.400]   500 people at 9 a.m. On Monday the next day so I looked and felt my best on that
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:49.000]   And you have an invitation we are gonna broadcast of course because Apple is streaming it good news
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.080]   We will do our usual snark our mysteries theater science theater 3000 version
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:59.160]   10 a.m. Pacific 1 p.m. Eastern 1800 UTC. Oh
[00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.760]   No, it's 1700 UTC
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:09.440]   There's gonna be so many people missing it by an hour I know and Andy you said you could could you could join us
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:14.440]   Absolutely watch live with us yay, and then the next day a week from today
[00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:16.280]   We'll do Mac break weekly with a
[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:22.080]   Serenity and Renee in studio. Yeah, you guys are gonna come up both both of whom will be wearing
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:27.440]   suspiciously long sleeves out of the camera range so okay, so obviously it's the watch
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:34.640]   Although Tim Cook said at the earnings call that it won't be available till April so we know it's an announcement for a product
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:39.560]   That will ship through weeks later or thereabouts or as much as
[00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:41.800]   Six weeks later, I guess
[00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:46.960]   Yeah, that's all it's the same day or ten days later or you know, it's unusual to have the event
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:49.880]   I think that far is it possible that the it's ready
[00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:55.600]   The rumor was that it was that it was a tentatively scheduled for March
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:59.640]   But they pushed it to April because they wanted a little bit more time and I'm happy for Apple to take every minute of that
[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:02.160]   Oh, yeah, let's get it right absolutely. Yeah
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:05.880]   And on the total totally crazy side it may not be the watch
[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:08.600]   Oh, come on stop it. Just stop it knock it off
[00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:14.080]   That would just be showing off wouldn't it, you know, like yeah, we've got this big watch going
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:17.360]   But let me show you this other time we have all the watch we'll do that in a couple of weeks
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:24.680]   Seriously though if you if they had a minor piece of news that they knew that they're not gonna get any attention for if they just simply
[00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:27.400]   Say well, here's what we're actually gonna be doing with beats. Here's the new beats music app
[00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:31.960]   They know if that's a way to get not only like 500 people to fly out for this event
[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:36.360]   But also to be paying attention because okay, but this is twice to the watch how okay?
[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:39.680]   So the music is music plays in the watch like that I wouldn't be shocked
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:44.040]   But I think that this this is such an important launch for Apple and such a unique one for them too
[00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:51.880]   Because they have never you really have to go back to the iPad for when else have they launched something when there is no
[00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:57.400]   Indication that people actually want this not even in any indication that people understand what this is
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:59.560]   I mean Leo you and I were smart watches every day
[00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:03.240]   We know how cool they are but we still have I still have problems explaining to people
[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.760]   Here's why I love wearing this watch every single day
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:14.960]   So they really need to spend a lot of time crafting a Game of Thrones scale story with texture and effects and special guests and
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:21.560]   Flying dragons and everything they can do to make the case for why you want to spend 350 dollars for a new gadget wristwatch
[00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:26.040]   Yeah, yesterday in the New York Times big article the Apple watch is nearly ready
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:32.560]   But is the public there is a considerable question mark over whether people want a smart watch
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:37.400]   I wonder if we're overthinking this I wonder if the mere fact that Apple is making a way like who makes your phone Apple
[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:41.480]   Who makes your tablet Apple Apple as a watch now? Oh, that's interesting. Let's go take a look at it
[00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:44.080]   Oh look shiny. I wonder if we're if it's a good idea
[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:51.000]   Thank you this and the well I think that the fact that we then we go back to the iPhone where a lot of people were willing to buy it
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.320]   Not only because it was cool because it was a cool apple gadget despite the fact that it really wasn't ready for mass consumption
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:01.680]   For at least two years after that so it's there's there's I don't see any way that this is not going to be a big hit
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:10.120]   The question is if it's going to be a system the question is the how soon do they get normal people to start buying these as opposed to Apple fans?
[00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:17.800]   We're just excited about the next Apple product it so is this a fair headline selling a smart watch to an uninterested public we're interested
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:20.320]   Uninformed rather than I'm interested
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:25.040]   Well, and I think that a lot of it's gonna one of the advantages that that Apple has is of course
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:31.280]   they're gonna get this huge surge of of the you know the believers that they want to try it out and get ahead of everything and
[00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:36.340]   That makes it easier to develop for you know, you know that that you have a lot of one large
[00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:39.600]   Group of people that are all doing the same thing at the same time
[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:44.480]   And I and I do think that when you start to see the kind of things being able to you know
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:49.320]   You I think we're gonna see companies that change the security system so you walk up and just open the door
[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:55.880]   You know, you know, you don't have to have a number of hotels are already adopting Apple watches
[00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:59.320]   Not only is a way to to open the door which they showed at the event
[00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:03.840]   But to check in just bypass the front. I need I need to watch to tell me what room I'm in so I can remember
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:09.840]   I'm in this would be nice. That would be good. Go to this and NFC NFC might be the killer
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:16.280]   component inside this watch because you can do so many things with NFC that you can't do through through radio and
[00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:21.840]   That is the sort of feature that if I can open a door just by tapping my watch against it or hopefully
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:23.640]   So that's a sapphire crystal on it
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:28.800]   But just by proximity a lot of people I think that that's no one's gonna spend 350 dollars for that one feature
[00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:32.880]   But that's worth a hundred and three dollars at least and that makes it a lot more palatable
[00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:35.840]   And the thing I like so much about that technology is that a lot
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:39.400]   I've used Bluetooth trusted objects or Bluetooth trusted devices before and I don't really like them
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:43.200]   They're deal-breakers for me because you know if I grab Phil Nickinson's little dongle off his shirt
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:43.800]   I'm Phil Nickinson
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:48.160]   I can unlock all his stuff and what I like about things like touch ID and with the Apple watch is either
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.440]   It's a fingerprint or it has to maintain skin contact
[00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:54.760]   So once it's authorized it knows that it's on you take that watch off as useless for somebody else
[00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:58.640]   But that watch on me could unlock my house could unlock my car could unlock my Mac
[00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:01.800]   Could unlock one password for me. So there's a lot of potential
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.480]   I think once you make the sensors not you know brilliant
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:07.200]   But a little bit smarter and they start to understand all that information
[00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:12.200]   Fingerprints gonna be so important going forward and Apple really led the way with that
[00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:16.600]   We've seen fingerprint readers before but none of them as good as touch ID Samsung announced this week
[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:24.960]   It's a galaxy s6 which will be available next month and it has a new fingerprint reader that doesn't require a swipe
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:27.400]   Yes, it's for shameless. Oh
[00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:30.680]   Come on, that's no, I'm so disappointed in that phone
[00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:37.480]   Like an iPhone and I love the I love the new HTC. I love the new Motorola
[00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:39.680]   I think they're doing it like the HTC one yes, it's iterative
[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:43.400]   But I like a lot about HTC to begin with the Motorola. I think they're really pushing things down market
[00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:46.480]   Sam's talking about the E yeah, the absolutely the model
[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:51.280]   Yeah, you know people who are interested in those kinds of phones making smartphones accessible to more people in more parts of the world
[00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:53.000]   I think they deserve tremendous credit
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.560]   Samsung is a company and based not just on all the inside stories that are floating around how they how they're working internally as a company
[00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:04.840]   These days but to me like I don't ever want to care more about my phone than the person who makes it and the the the
[00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:07.240]   Intent of Samsung to me is so directionless
[00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:09.320]   I don't know who to recommend that phone to anymore
[00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:13.840]   It used to be if you wanted a removable battery if you wanted waterproofing if you wanted certain features
[00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:20.040]   They took the stylus the removable battery the SD card and waterproof and it looks like there's no reason that phone has to look from any
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:24.880]   Angle like an iPhone there's no reason there's no reason that the that Samsung pay has to look like Apple
[00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:29.560]   I mean there's all of that stuff to me just shows an absence of design culture and I want people who are
[00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:34.000]   No, but he else has done the curved thing around the edge like that's interesting
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   But I want that yeah, that's that's way more
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.680]   I can't wait to get the galaxy note edge the galaxy note has always been a way more interesting film for me than the galaxy
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:46.320]   And they're straight galaxy. Yeah, I'm looking forward to the note again this year. Yeah, that won't be a fall probably
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:49.720]   But no, it's just it's just that what else are you?
[00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:56.400]   It's unmistakable that this design direction of the new galaxy S6 is
[00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:59.080]   Certainly influenced by by the iPhone
[00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:02.280]   We can even go as far as it was a rip off of a lot of different design elements
[00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:09.160]   But when you get into like little details like I just I I just don't like it when there's a comment like of course
[00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:12.040]   A fingerprint ID that works by actually touching it
[00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:17.920]   Of course they rip that off from the from the iPhone as opposed to know for years. That's been the desired
[00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:23.760]   Way to make fingerprint ID work. They just now have a component that is not made by Apple that makes up
[00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:30.280]   On this because it I thought Apple really owned this that's just that's a stupid lawsuit
[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:36.080]   But there was also like a couple of people are saying oh and guess what let's see the iPhone 6 has a bumped out camera lens
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:47.360]   Everything is a remix copy for just copy for this all I'm asking I think the note really does copy for it
[00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:49.680]   Takes good ideas and makes better ideas out of them
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:51.760]   But I think the galaxy S series isn't is not
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:57.560]   I'm gonna buy the edge. I think that's really cool looking there. You see how close the bottoms are Johnny
[00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:59.560]   I've said they got the lightning port wrong
[00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:06.520]   Fake Johnny abs right hey, but look at John Grover's tweet point wrong in the sense that this cable does not make any money for Apple ever
[00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:12.280]   Look I'm actually a little disappointed. They don't do the new USB
[00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:17.280]   What is it see yeah because that would have been reversible that would have been nice
[00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:19.440]   But I'm then I think nobody has that cable yet. So
[00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:27.680]   John Grover tweets the picture from Android Authority of how you register a fingerprint on the Samsung Galaxy S6
[00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:33.320]   Looks familiar rights Grover can't quite put my finger on where I've seen something like this before
[00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:39.920]   It's you registering the fingerprint just exactly as you do on the Samsung pay looks the same and s voice look the same
[00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:45.680]   The good news about this though is that you don't have to push it is very much like touch ID
[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:52.120]   And I'm encouraged because I thought Apple might have with their acquisition of authentic really kind of own
[00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:56.120]   You know snap that up and owned the idea that you could just push your put your finger
[00:17:56.120 --> 00:18:00.840]   I get like a year to two years advantage by doing technology even like when you look at unibodies on max
[00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:05.280]   They get about a year or two years head start by owning the technology and then everyone else sort of catches up
[00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:06.480]   And I think it's great the same size
[00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:09.840]   The way are you gonna yell an apple if they do a curved screen next year?
[00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:12.680]   Samsung's gonna build it
[00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:15.920]   Somebody said that too when we were doing the Samsung of it
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:22.480]   Maybe it was you Andy that one of the things that Samsung's making is a demo of all the parts you can get for your phone
[00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:27.040]   I think that was part of the keynote where they say list over here
[00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:29.920]   They went to the technical section with the thing here's all the components that go into it
[00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:31.400]   They didn't say it explicitly
[00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:37.600]   But I think that was not it was it was not an accent. They're saying oh and here's the Samsung made CPU and here's the Samsung made type of
[00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:41.720]   Rammer using and here's the Samsung made I don't think that I don't think that was a dig against other manufacturers
[00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:43.880]   But it did it was part of the ongoing
[00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:46.600]   Picture they wanted to paint of we are people
[00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:49.320]   We don't just make phones we make components that go into phones
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:52.480]   And so we're not so please ignore the how much this phone looks like
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:56.440]   I have to say I'm kind of with you Andy
[00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:02.680]   If there's an innovation from somebody whoever it is and it really is good such as touch ID
[00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:06.560]   I want to see it on more phones as long as they're not violating patents
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:12.840]   I want to see more it's I think it's I think it's I think it's I think it's I think it is tasteless when you see something as bold as
[00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:16.040]   The way that they did s force voice the way that they're doing the fingerprint
[00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:20.280]   Registration stuff like that but even even when like I'm testing an Android phone
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:24.000]   I'm thinking things like gee I really hope Apple steals this idea for the iPhone
[00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:29.320]   Because I want I want the best phone possible and I also want the best phone possible for all consumers
[00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:34.640]   So I don't care if they are even I don't care if they're even just saying outright in the keynote
[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:38.720]   Yeah, we really like the way that Apple did their camera assembly
[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:44.320]   So we did one just like it because we wanted to have the best camera assembly we could possibly have be nice if they just admitted it
[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:46.320]   Right I was
[00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:51.760]   When I say shameless I don't mean that isn't as intentionally as an insult one of my favorite quotes from Buffy ever was when Cordelia said
[00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:57.520]   Like shame is something to be proud of you can absolutely be incredibly successful in business when you're shameless
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:59.120]   I just think that you know last year
[00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:01.640]   I said something similar about the galaxy has five people said I was dumb
[00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:04.880]   I think the galaxy has five now is not widely regarded
[00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:07.120]   I think next year this won't be widely regarded
[00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:11.520]   I think like you're gonna be shameless you better be successful because otherwise all you are shameless
[00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:15.840]   Oh, I think that they're they're playing they're playing Apple's game against Apple
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:18.360]   like you know that they're playing right up against them rather than
[00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:23.520]   All the other things that distinguished that phone from from what the iPhone was so there was a lot of things
[00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:26.960]   They it wasn't you know with the the battery the you know
[00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:33.360]   All the other things that it had and I think that going head to head with Apple is probably in my opinion not probably the best
[00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:36.720]   Made for Apple well
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:39.760]   Waterproof maybe the Apple watch will be
[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:44.640]   Apparently visiting German Chancellor Angela Merkel Tim Cook
[00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:50.080]   Mentioned that he wears his Apple watch constantly even in the shower
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:56.920]   You know and Tim there's no accidents with Tim obviously knows everything he says is gonna be parsed
[00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:00.960]   Okay, but look who's saying that he can afford to buy a new watch every single day
[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:06.480]   I just call Johnny and say I showered with it again. Can you send me another one?
[00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:11.200]   You shower you peel off and you watch you put it on exactly what?
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:14.840]   Alright, so we know 350 bucks for the the sport one
[00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:20.120]   Which is not gonna be the most beautiful one. It's gonna have like a plastic band right well
[00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:26.080]   I don't remember can the sport one have the like the Milanese band. It's unclear
[00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:31.960]   All the bands are theoretically interchangeable although I don't know if Apple specified whether they'll be technically interchangeable between
[00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:38.720]   Collections, I think there is some like I was thinking earlier today about the reason for being for this the Apple watch edition
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:43.400]   Why Apple would make a gold watch $10,000 gold maybe 10,000 baby five?
[00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:47.480]   I mean who knows but it's definitely gold so it's gonna be at least as pricey as gold is pricey
[00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:53.840]   But it gets a lot of the coverage I've been looking at has been people guessing about prices specifically about the edition when Vogue is
[00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:56.920]   Hatted on the cover or in an exhibit it's been the Apple watch edition
[00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:59.960]   I think the aluminum one you say no one's gonna want it
[00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:04.320]   But I think sports people are gonna love it and I think people will like the idea that it's aspirational
[00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:07.200]   Yes, there's a gold one out there sitting at the top getting a lot of attention
[00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:10.200]   But you can have essentially the same watch for three hundred and fifty dollars
[00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:16.840]   It's that old you know everyone drinks the same coke argument. Don't give it a little I think it'll the least expensive one will outsell
[00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:18.840]   The others three to one or four to one
[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:23.520]   But I think people will you're right people will look at the other ones. Hey gosh. I wish I could afford that
[00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:29.240]   And will they be happy with the sport? Will they be happy with the sport version? Yeah? I?
[00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:34.160]   Think well, I think that the sport version is gonna be the the default for most people it is
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:38.000]   I think this I think the stainless steel one is gonna be the actual aspirational one
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.760]   And I think the gold one is going to be I just don't understand
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:47.240]   Like you and I think that this is yeah
[00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:53.200]   I mean not not just I'm and I hope I'm not being in delicate and saying that you're crazy if you buy a gold Apple watch
[00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:55.200]   But I'm saying that there are people who understand
[00:22:55.200 --> 00:23:01.100]   That there are people who can be moved up from hey, this the stainless steel one is made out of a harder material
[00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:03.880]   It's probably longer lasting. It's a little bit classier than aluminum
[00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:09.680]   There are very few people who can be talked up from stainless steel to gold or from sport to gold the people who
[00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:15.040]   The people who are gonna be buying the gold watch or the people who I think would never have considered buying anything but the gold watch
[00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:21.660]   Kept so we'll go and Kevin Rose is here Jason for our 10th anniversary twit on April. What is that April?
[00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:27.280]   I think it's the 19th 19th
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:30.520]   It's a more around there. He'll be wearing one. We'll get to see one then. Oh
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:34.200]   So watch right here, and I think you can afford it
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:38.840]   So no matter how much it costs that kind of thing the Apple watch edition is for people who want an Apple watch
[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:44.160]   But happen to wear gold watch and they think about $10,000 watch the way some with the Lamborghini thinks about gas right?
[00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:48.520]   What do we know do we have any speculation here? We are less than a week away
[00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:54.240]   I think I really would love to get the stainless steel one, but do we know what that's gonna cost?
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:56.240]   I don't want to pay it under bucks for
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:24:01.140]   Unknown I'm good. Yeah, I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. I mean it's not it's not based on anything other than what
[00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:07.160]   Price I think the market will bear it's a thousand isn't it? It's gonna be a thousand between 500 and a thousand seems like
[00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:12.560]   I think six or seven hundred dollars seems like the right depending on the band more than that some bands will be more expensive
[00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:19.220]   That's what that's what makes this so interesting because especially when you get into the edition. It's you feel as though
[00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:21.760]   I'm of two minds. I can see Apple
[00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:28.440]   Serenely standing back while everybody speculates ten thousand dollars twelve thousand dollars fifteen thousand dollars and then having a price
[00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:34.420]   That's just under five just so that it will seem not as expensive as it should as it might have been
[00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:38.520]   Despite the fact that it's still a five thousand dollar electronic gadget that no one's really sure that they actually I
[00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:44.560]   I have it exactly or I could see them saying look we're not we're not gonna take over the market for gold watches
[00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:51.060]   But man, we can really elevate the entire brand if everyone knows that there's an eighteen thousand dollar version of this watch
[00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:53.780]   And I know some I don't have one and I don't know someone who has one
[00:24:53.780 --> 00:25:00.060]   But my uncle works with somebody at his firm who has one and boys at cool and that's then that's where I
[00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:05.500]   Want to see the dry erase board where the numbers at Apple whether try to figure out what to change
[00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:12.060]   So it keeps going up and keeps going down and you see all these like little ghost images of like two two and then like three cross throughs
[00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:14.240]   on it
[00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:19.940]   42 millimeter cost more than that what is the other size 38 38? Yeah, and it sounds like a very small amount
[00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:23.820]   But it's basically 10% of the size of that device is the gold watches gonna cost more
[00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:27.820]   I'm just one thing people who are watch phatics should notice that apples measuring vertically not horizontally
[00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:31.100]   Which I think is the norm in the industry, so it's 42 millimeters high not wide
[00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:37.300]   Yeah, which makes I was talking I was talking to watch makers about the trying to throw in the pictures and give them impressions of when I was
[00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:43.580]   When I worked in in September and they really open eyes to here's how little gold goes into the case of
[00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:47.100]   A watch like that. We really are talking like a pocket watch case
[00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:52.660]   And it's really they gave me numbers that were all over the map for how many grams or ounces of gold would have to go into a case
[00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:57.180]   Like that so that's why I throw up my hands. I don't know I absolutely have no idea
[00:25:57.180 --> 00:25:59.820]   I thought I thought I get some sort of a ball park
[00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:05.060]   You get a minimum if you know you knew it was gonna be eight grams of gold or whatever and you'd get a minimum that for the gold alone
[00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:07.380]   Yeah, I'm really interested to see if there's
[00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:13.660]   When you're thinking about the gold I'd be really interested to see if there's any any thought of the anti-theft kind of things
[00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:15.660]   That you see with the iPhone as well
[00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:19.500]   You know that yeah, some kind of activation lock knows who you are
[00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:24.940]   It's you know, so theoretically unless you unlock it and make it available to someone else it could just
[00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:27.580]   Not work for anybody else
[00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:31.580]   Will the guts be the same
[00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:41.340]   Yes, it's the S1 chip. Yeah, it seems like the only difference again is the the the sapphire glass on the higher end models on the stainless steel and the gold model
[00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:47.420]   It doesn't make any sense unless they can say that this is the exact same watch only in different cases
[00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:53.180]   I don't think that they I think that's that causes way more problems for them. They can solve yes, it's hard to develop for it's hard to
[00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:56.100]   We don't know capacity yet though. I mean if there's a difference in the amount of
[00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:59.620]   Flash storage in different models, but they haven't said anything about that yet
[00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:07.460]   I think that's that's even that would even kill their whole argument if they if they say that the gold version of this watch
[00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:11.980]   Does anything that the stainless steel or even the sport one doesn't do then?
[00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:18.420]   I think they've lost their argument over the specialness over addition that this is designed this is
[00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:25.180]   Luxury and even more than that. This is fashion. We're not charging you an extra X thousand or ten thousand dollars
[00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:33.660]   For an extra feature for more RAM the ability to have more more apps resident the ability to stream more music directly via Bluetooth from the watch
[00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:39.020]   We are telling you that we have designed an item of sophistication and elegance and that's why we are asking you an extra
[00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:42.500]   X thousand or ten thousand dollars for exclusive Rolex watch face
[00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:49.940]   Well, it's exciting anything else any surprises Monday
[00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:54.100]   I don't know if the watch is the only thing that they're gonna talk about
[00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:58.300]   You know, I think that there's I'm telling you it's not about the watch that that peacock
[00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:02.300]   It really is about an NBC deal for the Apple TV is really what this is all about
[00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:08.700]   That you guys miss the whole thing that would be a beautiful place to sneak that sort of thing in but I thought about this last week
[00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:12.020]   And thinking well, what's what could they really release and they're?
[00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:17.100]   Rumors of an iPad Pro and they wouldn't want that to be overshadowed by Apple watch
[00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:21.500]   They're rumors of a compact retina air. I think that too
[00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:23.500]   They would not want it to be overshadowed by the watch
[00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:28.980]   It would have to be an announcement that is so simple that this is the only way to get people to pay that much attention to it
[00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:32.860]   But not so big that we should be toward the Apple TV
[00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:37.460]   I would expect some beats news maybe because especially if the baby watch can play music
[00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:42.580]   Although the stuff is supposed to be iOS 8.4 and still have 8.2 and 8.3 rollout yet
[00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:47.140]   And to Alex's point the iPads traditionally had or at least one year
[00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:51.980]   They had Apple TVs with them the original iPad sorry the original iPhone introduction had you know Apple TV
[00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:56.020]   Yeah, but times have changed now. They have many more events than they used to
[00:28:56.420 --> 00:29:01.300]   They're completely capable of having two events in two months. We know that from last year
[00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:03.900]   But they do two spring events that'd be super interesting that would be
[00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:11.380]   Yeah, I like a retin air or or or some kind of you know the pro model
[00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:18.860]   Or and an Apple TV think between this and the watch it also just shows Apple's ability to continue to do stuff
[00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:23.620]   So I think that there's a there's a statement that that makes if they're if they do that and if they're looking at releasing in April
[00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:29.020]   You're still looking at you know three four or five weeks of run is assuming that it's ready to ship
[00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:31.420]   relatively soon is nothing in the spring
[00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:35.260]   We had two years and nothing in the spring and now we don't know where they're gonna fit all these products
[00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:42.500]   Yep, because the problem is is that after the watch and I think you have to give up six weeks, you know before you do anything major
[00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:43.420]   so
[00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:45.420]   You know you're now starting to push
[00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:52.540]   The you know any any other announcements into June which might make sense when you're looking at WWDC, but but otherwise otherwise
[00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:55.660]   It seems like you might have to push some stuff out that you might want to get out earlier
[00:29:55.660 --> 00:30:02.580]   You know the the pro you know the the air or to the whatever they're gonna call it, you know the pro version of the iPad is
[00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:08.300]   Is going to they're gonna want to get that out in the spring because they want people to be thinking about it for the fall
[00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:15.060]   Tim Cook said some other things in Germany. He wasn't a public event. He was talking to employees
[00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:17.420]   But he did say
[00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:23.740]   They'll be it sounds like they're gonna show a host of apps on Monday in addition to the watch itself
[00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:27.620]   And that would make a lot of sense. These aren't apps that would be on the watch standalone, but these are
[00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:32.340]   Phone apps that will have a watch presence Panera bread
[00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:40.780]   Will an early Apple pay partners working to jump on the Apple bandwagon according to Mark Gurman at 9f5 Mac
[00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:46.520]   Salesforce comm cook said is also developing you've done some stuff for salesforce
[00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:49.180]   A lot of stuff for salesforce. They're also
[00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:55.860]   Software for the Apple watch you know they and they've been salesforce has been way ahead of iOS development from day one
[00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:57.820]   I mean and they have issued I don't know
[00:30:57.820 --> 00:31:02.140]   I don't know what to every employee but to many many people and all their sales staff and everything else all have iPads
[00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:08.420]   And so this is this is an easy move for them a lot of their development is all based around you know pushing the iOS
[00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:12.020]   And this is a perfect solution for a for a sales, you know salesperson
[00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:15.900]   So so I think that it makes a lot of sense for them. Apparently you're interesting because
[00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:18.780]   Go ahead Renee. I was gonna say the
[00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:23.780]   Actionable notifications as far as I understand if you've implemented the iOS 8 style that'll just work
[00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:30.340]   So if you have a favorite communications app that sends you push notifications now that has like that reply or or mark is red buttons
[00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:34.700]   Those should just work on the Apple watch it'll be able to pull those in and you can set them the way you like them
[00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:37.620]   If you want to make a glance you have to build that that's like a little widget
[00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:40.660]   It's like building a widget for the today view notification center
[00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:41.460]   So it's a little bit of work
[00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:46.380]   But if you just want to have persistent information instead of information that comes and goes based on an alert system
[00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:49.820]   You can do that and then if you want more interactivity you can build a watchkit app
[00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:54.820]   Which is like a remote view that displays on the watch instead of on the phone and that's even more work
[00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:57.140]   But it gives you more capability on the phone
[00:31:57.140 --> 00:32:01.700]   And I think the interesting thing will be to see apps figure out exactly what they need and how they need it
[00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:05.300]   But Apple's been bringing in developers since before the event we saw Twitter
[00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:10.740]   I think maybe even Facebook at the event back in September and they've been bringing developers in over and over again since then
[00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:13.780]   So we should see some some really well thought out well honed stuff
[00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:20.420]   Apparently german says a hundred developers have been invited to kupertino to polish up their apps prior to the launch
[00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:26.420]   That's not a surprise because I've been seeing a lot of interfaces and a lot of people have been showing me interfaces and my notes back
[00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:29.780]   Have been you're this screen is a lot smaller than you think it is
[00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:33.860]   Yes, I think it is going to be like developing for the iPad where there's so many
[00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:40.620]   I did not meet a developer before the iPad came out who did not have some sort of like cardboard or resin model of the
[00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:46.620]   iPad that they were sticking screenshots into to get some sort of feel for what this will feel like to use
[00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:53.340]   And I don't think that it's easy to figure out how this is how an interface is going to interact with when you scale it down to this size
[00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:55.340]   But that said it's no accident that
[00:32:55.340 --> 00:33:02.620]   During the September event the one of the big things they were showing off with look at this huge constellation of circular app icons
[00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:05.980]   And look how easy it is to zoom through all of the different app icons
[00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:10.940]   You will be able to pick from when you launch this app. This is a very apple approach to this sort of product
[00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:15.900]   It's not about putting cards notifications and having Google now sort of have a presence on your wrist
[00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:19.020]   It really is you have to have a targeted app platform
[00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:20.860]   That's what apple does so very well
[00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:23.180]   And that's the strength of the things that they make
[00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:27.260]   And one of the big things that they didn't I think really smartly is on if you go to apples developer stuff
[00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:32.060]   They really try to help you see you know like this is a watch people aren't going to be sitting there playing with it for hours
[00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:34.620]   They're not going to be look your app is going to surface to them when they need it
[00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:40.060]   Either a notification will come up or they'll know they have to go and check some sort of delivery information or reference information
[00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:44.060]   So make sure that your experience is not app centric but action centric
[00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:46.540]   And also make sure that there's handoff on the watch for example
[00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:48.460]   So anything that might be too long or too fussy
[00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:52.140]   Just send it back to the phone if it's if the watch is supposed to save people time
[00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:56.220]   Not be there to fuss with so give that back to the watch they can do it much more easily on a big screen
[00:33:56.220 --> 00:34:00.700]   The developers have been this is funny. It was almost prophetic the article
[00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:04.060]   Mark wrote about developers coming to kapertina was from February 16th
[00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:09.820]   He said it was as if something urgent was motivating apple like an event was imminent
[00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:15.100]   The developers were traveling to kapertina on an urgent timeline
[00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:22.220]   They said that a sense of secrecy surrounds the meeting the different developers in the room were not identified by name
[00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:27.820]   But by unique numbers so that other developers in the room wouldn't know what others are up to
[00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:35.020]   Some leaks coming out of this mark scottam all developers in attendance called the watch's digital crown
[00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:37.260]   Quote really nice
[00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:41.020]   But one said that force touch takes time to get used to
[00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:46.380]   Another developer said the taptic engine vibrating features not as impressive as expected
[00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:50.620]   I've heard good things about the force press the problem with the force press
[00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:53.260]   I think some people it's supposed to be like a second click
[00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:58.300]   But I think some people must took it for a hamburger button and just thought they could put every function you wanted as soon as you hit that
[00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:02.700]   Screen with light up with buttons, which is something you know that's fiercely fiercely looked down upon
[00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:06.380]   Right and I'm sure that one of the reasons those developers there is to get spanked about stuff like that
[00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:08.780]   I think it's so important for apple
[00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:13.580]   I think this is the thing that that a lot of will miss is that it's so important to make sure that they come out of the gate with some
[00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:15.660]   Great apps. They don't need they don't need thousands of great apps
[00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:20.940]   But a hundred of them would be you know be enough to show some great examples because that's gonna set the pace for everyone else
[00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:23.580]   I think that a lot of times when when developers don't
[00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:27.100]   Figure that out and just kind of throw it out there and hope that people develop for it
[00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:31.340]   You know you get a lot of really geeky stuff that doesn't really work and then that affects the entire platform
[00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:37.340]   And I can verify that employees or in the stores are getting training because we've seen an abnormal number of
[00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:43.340]   Retail employees in our studios last few weeks coming to kubertino for training
[00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:49.580]   Um, what about the rumor that there's gonna be a big kind of look change to the apple store
[00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:51.820]   Somebody pointed out that johnny. I've said well
[00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:56.140]   I would never want to buy an apple watch unless i'm standing on carpet
[00:35:56.620 --> 00:35:58.620]   But
[00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:04.620]   Tristy will destroy the device and you have to buy another one for 12 000
[00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:08.380]   And then nico daman in our chat room had a very good point
[00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:14.460]   Probably no pre-orders because this is something you're gonna want to go into the store right and get it
[00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:19.180]   And oh, I think that I think there's a lot of people that are ready to order it
[00:36:19.180 --> 00:36:24.140]   I think that's but don't you I mean are they gonna size it or you just get a band and then you figure it out
[00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:29.580]   Besides it yourself they pop off. Yeah, okay. Yeah, um, yeah, I mean i'm by its side unseen
[00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:33.020]   Does even I see yeah
[00:36:33.020 --> 00:36:37.740]   Yeah, it'll be interest. I'm so interested to see what the packaging is like for the edition
[00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:42.300]   I'm so interested to see what the sales experience is supposed to be like if it really can be
[00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:46.220]   You know you walk in your methador by someone in a t-shirt holding a phone
[00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:51.500]   They swipe your credit card. We've been extended for five seconds. They hand you a box. They said you're on your way
[00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:56.940]   They're gonna do it the same way they do the phones when the phones come out, you know lines out front and the countdown you go in and
[00:36:56.940 --> 00:37:01.820]   Take all the watches. I mean there's something special about those events, especially for new products when they launch
[00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:03.180]   I know what it's gonna happen
[00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:07.660]   I'm gonna be number four in line and I'm gonna get to the front there because they well we've sold out of the
[00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:12.300]   $350 and the $5,000 version, but there's plenty of additions left. Would you like?
[00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:20.140]   Oh, I'll take it. I do that with the phone sprint. I gotta have a sprint. All right
[00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:24.780]   I'll take it. You still have the blue rubber band. Okay. We'll give you the go station with the blue rubber band
[00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:30.860]   You all gonna buy right you're all gonna buy watches, right? You could buy the cheap ones
[00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:32.940]   All right because your cheap skates
[00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:34.540]   I know some people who want to get multiple ones
[00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:39.580]   They want to get like an addition to wear out fancy and once they're buying the edition extra 350 bucks for the sport to wear to the gym
[00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:41.580]   Is nothing for them. Oh my god
[00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:45.820]   Yeah, one free risk field. Yeah, there's a power reserve mode
[00:37:47.180 --> 00:37:53.980]   Apparently according to the New York Times that says well when you when you get low on power will continue to show the time
[00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:57.020]   but uh so that's good because
[00:37:57.020 --> 00:38:00.620]   Sometimes people do wear wristwatches to know what time it is
[00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:06.860]   That's crazy talk the code name was apparently gizmo or sounds delightful. I like gizmo
[00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:09.580]   Like that. Yep
[00:38:09.580 --> 00:38:12.700]   This is from that uninterested public story
[00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:17.260]   What else because you can't feed it after midnight or can't
[00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:20.460]   I think any illusions to grab
[00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:29.020]   Any other anything else to report. I mean, this is all this is the traditional and I apologize because I know people go, oh
[00:38:29.020 --> 00:38:34.220]   The the last show before an apple event all it is is sitting around by what are they gonna say?
[00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:34.860]   What are they gonna?
[00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:38.940]   I was going through my photos and I saw one with the hay theory interface and I've kind of forgotten about that
[00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:41.660]   But the idea that I'll just be able to lift the watch up and say hay theory
[00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:46.060]   What's the weather? I mean that that sort of thing to me is it is much better than plotting kind of poke around
[00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:49.100]   Does it have a speaker on the watch? Yep. You can do phone calls in the watch
[00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:51.500]   You can
[00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:55.580]   It's like it's better not to do them for long periods of time just hand them off to your phone, but you can do them
[00:38:55.580 --> 00:38:57.900]   Yeah
[00:38:57.900 --> 00:39:01.820]   Yeah, that's I have a I have a piece that's in both my editor right now
[00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:05.420]   That's just basically an anticipation of the watch announcement last next week
[00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:09.580]   Here is everything that I've learned in over six months of wearing a smartwatch every day
[00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:14.700]   And really the ability to just not even work with an interface but just raise your thing up your wrist and just
[00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:18.300]   Please do this thing for me wait three seconds for to acknowledge
[00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:22.620]   Okay, I'm doing that thing for you then put your wrist back down that in itself is just a killer feature
[00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:27.820]   I use that so at least two-thirds the times I use this watch when I'm not just checking the time
[00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:30.860]   It's doing giving it a voice command so dick Tracy
[00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:38.220]   I do I do find it amazing how quickly they sucked all the energy out of the mobile congress
[00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:41.420]   Is that funny? I mean
[00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:46.380]   Good timing. I'm over and over again. Nice job. Yeah, they do it over. Yeah, not yeah, not only there's no no accident there
[00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:50.140]   You know, you know the that that they you know, they have iPhoto
[00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:52.780]   Or I'm sorry, uh, iPhone
[00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:57.660]   Bill board on ice on there and found something that they won't tell you about and everything else on the days that
[00:39:57.660 --> 00:39:59.820]   It really takes, you know, it takes a lot of energy
[00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:02.220]   I just got to be very frustrating to be in Barcelona
[00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:07.020]   We're also learning how apple hid the apple watch including making Samsung
[00:40:07.660 --> 00:40:09.660]   uh, like cases
[00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:12.700]   For their employees to wear those are gone by the way
[00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:15.500]   We now know when you see somebody wearing an apple watch it's obvious
[00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:20.140]   But they wanted to make them look like galaxy gear smart watches. It's pretty funny
[00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:24.860]   Um the last thing you got the last person you're gonna look at is the person who actually bought a galaxy gear
[00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:28.540]   So that's yeah, I was brilliant. Oh god that guy don't be that guy
[00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:34.060]   Also international sales and I know our audience, you know, a large they're a great ad. What?
[00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:36.780]   There'd be a great ad with rob loh
[00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:40.860]   Watch versus the sam say don't be the same. I'm sorry. I
[00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:44.380]   Um, even run android it runs something other than android
[00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:47.420]   Tizen
[00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:54.060]   Uh apple watch, uh, maybe in available internationally quickly, which is good news. I think for a lot of people who?
[00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:55.260]   Um
[00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:57.020]   Including rene richy
[00:40:57.020 --> 00:41:00.540]   According to unnamed employees at this uh, german event
[00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:05.260]   Tim said that the apple watch would be available in april outside the us
[00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:10.780]   Best press briefing ever. Yeah, this because he's in germany you can assume germany is one of those countries
[00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:13.260]   Um
[00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:16.780]   You know, it's not really a question. I don't think there's any reason when it couldn't be available
[00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:19.020]   I don't even know I guess it would have to get uh
[00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:25.180]   The equivalent of fcc approval in every country, but uh, it's not as complicated as usually manufacturing like the ipad
[00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:27.500]   I think it took 30 days to go international maybe 60 days
[00:41:27.580 --> 00:41:32.300]   But it was it was manufacturing constraints and the apple watch the hardware as far as I know has been ready for a while
[00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:37.180]   So that's why i'm not too worried about the software taking time because the more time that takes the more apple watches
[00:41:37.180 --> 00:41:39.580]   They can make and hopefully that means more countries they can ship
[00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:42.780]   One analyst now saying 15 million in
[00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:48.620]   2015 we the leak was that the apple's making will have five million
[00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:55.740]   Ready and we agreed last week the supply would be constrained unless centers from tidbits did the math on the amount of gold
[00:41:55.740 --> 00:41:59.980]   It would take to hit the wall street journals numbers and I think it was most of the gold that was currently on the market
[00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:06.780]   You're kidding. We'll see we'll see how that what really was hold up. Well, they're not all look. Okay. What is the percentage? It's going to be
[00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:09.420]   75% sport
[00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:12.380]   It's going to be uh the 25
[00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:14.220]   24.9
[00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:15.900]   percent
[00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:18.940]   Stainless steel and 0.01 or 0.1
[00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:21.660]   Addition right it's going to be a tiny fraction
[00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:25.100]   Well, i'm going to be one sixth. I think which is six. No
[00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:31.980]   That's rubbish. That's pretty high. Yeah, that's well. It depends on how much it costs but if it at a thousand or fifteen hundred dollars, maybe
[00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:35.580]   Um, which I think still pretty high priced but pay for watch but
[00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:40.460]   Um at six thousand dollars or five thousand dollars. I think you're definitely looking at yeah
[00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:44.620]   There was a million in the first quarter. We sounded ridiculous a million additions
[00:42:44.620 --> 00:42:48.140]   Yeah, 850,000 to a million additions in the first quarter. It sounds pretty
[00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:51.660]   I mean, I could see I could see a surge at the very beginning
[00:42:51.980 --> 00:42:55.100]   Yeah, because that because again, I'm trying to get right away
[00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:59.980]   I'm trying to get my head in the space of somebody who would pay that much money for
[00:42:59.980 --> 00:43:01.820]   For a device like this
[00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:05.740]   And i'm thinking that I want to be seen as one of these people who not not only can afford this
[00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:12.140]   But I also had the connections to find the store that had these for sale and set one of my assistants and beat him or her savagely
[00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:14.940]   Until he they found me the one with the serpentine band that I wanted
[00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:17.420]   They I think that's going to be an early sort of thing
[00:43:17.740 --> 00:43:23.660]   It's going to be interesting to see six to eight to ten months later is it still going to be a desirable thing to have
[00:43:23.660 --> 00:43:27.980]   But yeah, it's ridiculous to think that one out of every six of these is going to be an additional watch
[00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:34.300]   It's everything is possible and I'm prepared to simply I'm prepared to admit that wow I did not expect that boy was I wrong
[00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:39.180]   But I just don't I would like not to believe that I live in a world where one out of six
[00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:45.260]   Of these watches when there's a really beautiful stainless steel one and an affordable aluminum one would be the solid gold one
[00:43:45.580 --> 00:43:50.780]   It's going to be like Ferrari you're going to have to buy the midnight blue first to get on the list to buy the red one to get on the list
[00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:52.460]   To buy the blue
[00:43:52.460 --> 00:43:59.500]   How how long is it going to take for somebody to come up with some sort of like a vinyl product that will let you turn an aluminum one
[00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:03.260]   Well, you can I think you can analyze them right you can
[00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:07.500]   Know you're going to see him on the ward shows you're going to see the hollywood
[00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:11.100]   Royalty will be wearing them right i'm cardassian day one
[00:44:11.100 --> 00:44:13.180]   But you know I have to
[00:44:13.180 --> 00:44:16.140]   Keeps I keep the keep these off the cardassians
[00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:23.580]   To never aware of these watches the gold iphones code name was cut well the informal code name was cardass
[00:44:23.580 --> 00:44:25.660]   Yeah, that's funny
[00:44:25.660 --> 00:44:27.580]   Yeah, no, yes
[00:44:27.580 --> 00:44:33.180]   One of my friends actually uh anodized a an iphone six an iphone five for kim cardassian a gold one
[00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:37.420]   And she was using it so much that they started, you know, jokingly calling it the cardassian instead apple
[00:44:37.420 --> 00:44:40.460]   We're gonna take a break
[00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:47.180]   I actually have to revise my numbers because uh even one in a thousand additions would I think be very high
[00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:49.900]   Um, do you think it'll be well anyway?
[00:44:49.900 --> 00:44:53.740]   We'll see what in so many mac pros compared to macbook areas are there
[00:44:53.740 --> 00:44:56.460]   My mac pro my mac pro
[00:44:56.460 --> 00:44:59.580]   By the way slows down a lot
[00:44:59.580 --> 00:45:02.940]   That's making you doing on it leo. I don't know nothing
[00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:08.700]   I'm kind of mad. I get a lot of beach. I'm gonna have to have rebuild or something. I tuned it doesn't count
[00:45:09.820 --> 00:45:12.940]   At least the mac pro and the mac area are two very different machines
[00:45:12.940 --> 00:45:16.620]   You could say that I need a mac pro for what I do this. This is why I again
[00:45:16.620 --> 00:45:21.580]   I hope I hope I'm not speaking so clumsily as to make fun of anybody who's interested in the addition
[00:45:21.580 --> 00:45:28.300]   I'm just saying that I have so confused by trying to picture who would want to buy this as opposed to somebody else
[00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:30.380]   That I have to realize that I have no idea
[00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:36.540]   I'm I have to I have to I have to purge her. I have to I have to basically say that I acknowledge my humility here that I have no idea
[00:45:36.540 --> 00:45:41.340]   Who's gonna buy this? I think it's people who just buy gold watches, Andy. I think they just they that's
[00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:46.940]   Bickel bit just it's just don't even spend on you. Kevin rose kim kardashian Kanye
[00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:50.780]   This is not this is not a representative sample
[00:45:50.780 --> 00:45:53.180]   I know but I've spoken to about a dozen people
[00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:54.940]   I know and friends of friends
[00:45:54.940 --> 00:45:58.300]   I know who who think of nothing of spending 15 thousand dollars on a watch
[00:45:58.300 --> 00:46:04.620]   They really like and there's just not a lot of interest from those people in this watch the things they like about expensive watches
[00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:09.180]   It's not well, I just want to have the same thing that everybody else has but I want it in gold
[00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:11.740]   They it's by the way, this just in
[00:46:11.740 --> 00:46:17.900]   275 pounds of gold were stolen yesterday in an armored truck heist worth 4.8 million dollars
[00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:21.660]   I think we know where that gold is on its way to kubertino
[00:46:21.660 --> 00:46:31.100]   Gold looks so good though, doesn't it? I'm somebody said just buy this sport watch and a gold bar and you'll be ahead
[00:46:31.100 --> 00:46:33.660]   Sounds like a classic joker caper to me
[00:46:34.540 --> 00:46:36.540]   I showed it. They brought to you by
[00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:38.700]   Fresh books
[00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:42.380]   Fresh books is the easy to use invoicing software that I used
[00:46:42.380 --> 00:46:47.100]   You know freelancing is tough being a small business tough
[00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:50.060]   If you have to do all the book work including the invoices
[00:46:50.060 --> 00:46:52.700]   That end of the month doesn't look good
[00:46:52.700 --> 00:46:57.260]   It's just a pain in the butt to fire up word or excel or numbers or whatever it is you use and
[00:46:57.260 --> 00:47:01.820]   Prinham and mailham and all that stuff and then you got to keep an eye on them and his people
[00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:06.140]   As accounts age and they get behind you got to make the the embarrassing phone call
[00:47:06.140 --> 00:47:08.860]   Fresh books solves all of this first of all
[00:47:08.860 --> 00:47:12.220]   It makes your invoices beautiful professional
[00:47:12.220 --> 00:47:16.060]   easy to send out and easy to pay
[00:47:16.060 --> 00:47:18.860]   Which is really a big deal in fact
[00:47:18.860 --> 00:47:23.900]   On average fresh books customers get paid five days faster
[00:47:23.900 --> 00:47:27.580]   Because your it turns out your client doesn't doesn't mind paying you
[00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:31.020]   It's just it's it's as much of a pain in the butt for them to do the book work is you
[00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:34.860]   So they just if they see that pay me button right there on the invoice they go, okay
[00:47:34.860 --> 00:47:41.020]   Fresh book integrates with all your apps google apps pay pal stripe mailchipped fun box and payroll
[00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:44.540]   They've got an api too, which means anybody can develop more apps
[00:47:44.540 --> 00:47:50.060]   That's why there is really a rich and growing ecosystem of fresh books users fresh books customers

[00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:56.940]   and if a client should be slow to pay no mo no matter because uh
[00:47:57.420 --> 00:47:59.740]   Fresh books will automatically send out reminders
[00:47:59.740 --> 00:48:03.900]   And it says it just eliminates that difficult conversation

[00:48:37.100 --> 00:48:43.660]   When you go to fresh books dot com slash mac break fresh books dot com slash mac break if they do uh, I think there's a
[00:48:43.660 --> 00:48:46.940]   Place on the uh form where they say how did you hear about us?
[00:48:46.940 --> 00:48:49.340]   Make sure you tell them mac break weekly, will you
[00:48:49.340 --> 00:48:52.220]   fresh books dot com slash
[00:48:52.220 --> 00:48:54.780]   Mac break we love them
[00:48:55.020 --> 00:49:00.380]   Always very grateful to fresh books all right enough about the watch we're all excited live coverage once again
[00:49:00.380 --> 00:49:07.660]   Monday the apple stream begins at 10 a.m pacific 1 p.m. Eastern time 1700
[00:49:07.660 --> 00:49:10.140]   UTC we will be here
[00:49:10.140 --> 00:49:14.460]   Uh shortly before that with me and andi and I imagine there'll be quite a few others on our team
[00:49:14.460 --> 00:49:22.220]   Uh as we watch with interest to see what apple announces and then a very special mac break weekly one week from today
[00:49:23.100 --> 00:49:26.700]   Renee and uh serenity will be in studio with us and we'll be uh
[00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:29.660]   figuring out what it all means
[00:49:29.660 --> 00:49:35.340]   They're not going to have them available there. You're not going to like walk away with that would be I want you to
[00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:40.540]   Some people were talking about that because apple I don't I've never gotten a pre-release review unit from apple
[00:49:40.540 --> 00:49:45.820]   But it always seems like those are a week out. I don't know if apple's ever given that view units to anything a month out
[00:49:45.820 --> 00:49:50.220]   That's that would be pretty long. They've done it before where
[00:49:50.940 --> 00:49:55.980]   Again, there is the seek there there is a meeting on site in which you get stuff a couple weeks before there
[00:49:55.980 --> 00:50:01.100]   Sometimes have done stuff where you meet them in a neutral city
[00:50:01.100 --> 00:50:06.540]   So to speak so I think either people either some people are going to be leaving with the early hardware
[00:50:06.540 --> 00:50:11.100]   Or some people are going to be making trips to new york and or san francisco in the near future
[00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:17.820]   I was a very jolly boy this morning when my i'm telling i'm telling you rene make sure you join whatever airlines frequent flyer program
[00:50:17.820 --> 00:50:20.540]   Just in case you'll be back
[00:50:21.420 --> 00:50:26.460]   Uh, I would strongly suggest if you're in the public beta for your 70 that
[00:50:26.460 --> 00:50:34.140]   You get you get over to your updates and see what you got. I got up this morning my mac pro said hey 10 point 10.3
[00:50:34.140 --> 00:50:38.140]   It's in beta still but the public beta and it includes photos
[00:50:38.140 --> 00:50:44.700]   So serenity wrote an ice article about this including how to get it if you're not already in the public beta
[00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:50.220]   Program and now we know a little bit more about photos. What's uh, what's new rene in apples photos?
[00:50:50.220 --> 00:50:56.380]   Which is basically a replacing aperture as far as we can tell yes replacing i photo and aperture is probably more
[00:50:56.380 --> 00:51:02.220]   It's it's sort of like an i photo plus it doesn't have all the features that aperture has and apple's not pretending that it does
[00:51:02.220 --> 00:51:05.020]   It might get extensibility, you know photo plugins at some point
[00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:09.500]   There's none in it right now i played with a little bit before I came in this morning felt very much like i photo
[00:51:10.140 --> 00:51:15.260]   Yeah, it's it's based very similarly on the photos app for ios so much though that they're using ux kit
[00:51:15.260 --> 00:51:18.940]   Which is sort of like a bridging framework to actually develop it which is really interesting
[00:51:18.940 --> 00:51:24.220]   But it's if you take the ios version of photos that you're used to and you add more advanced
[00:51:24.220 --> 00:51:28.700]   A few more advanced editing features and of course the scale and power of the mac to it
[00:51:28.700 --> 00:51:31.580]   Then you'll have a pretty good idea what you can do with photos for west
[00:51:31.580 --> 00:51:37.020]   For when I launched it asked me you want to import your i photo library. I said yes. It did that fairly quickly
[00:51:37.020 --> 00:51:39.180]   um
[00:51:39.180 --> 00:51:40.540]   and
[00:51:40.540 --> 00:51:42.060]   I don't know
[00:51:42.060 --> 00:51:42.700]   What happens?
[00:51:42.700 --> 00:51:47.020]   Do you lose any data if you're using aperture and it supports your aperture of
[00:51:47.020 --> 00:51:52.780]   Data it'll do both it'll import it and it's also very space conservative when it does it because it references the existing files
[00:51:52.780 --> 00:51:56.940]   But once you've imported them if you can still go back and use i photo or use aperture
[00:51:56.940 --> 00:52:00.860]   But the changes you do to those will not be reflected in photos dot app and vice versa
[00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:06.700]   So it's not a common database anymore. No, it's it's brought in but then they remain two separate things just for people who don't
[00:52:06.780 --> 00:52:12.540]   Who want to play with it, but don't want to commit to it yet. Yeah, that may change on release. We don't know do when will release be
[00:52:12.540 --> 00:52:13.820]   Do we know?
[00:52:13.820 --> 00:52:19.820]   Yeah, they said the spring which to me sounds again like an april sort of thing and they also advise that if you want if you have multiple
[00:52:19.820 --> 00:52:23.500]   Light you can have multiple libraries on photos. You can do the same sort of you know alt click
[00:52:23.500 --> 00:52:25.420]   I think it's alt and and open it
[00:52:25.420 --> 00:52:30.700]   But if you want to reconcile your libraries first do that in aperture before you move them over. Okay, that's good to know
[00:52:30.700 --> 00:52:36.060]   Uh and your stacks projects and events will be converted to albums
[00:52:36.700 --> 00:52:41.500]   Mm-hmm. So you don't lose any organization your ratings become keywords, which will irks some people
[00:52:41.500 --> 00:52:45.020]   But it's it's it's your ratings free world in photos. Oh, that's interesting
[00:52:45.020 --> 00:52:50.060]   So like one star will actually be one star as a keyword in that photo. Oh god. That's really annoying
[00:52:50.060 --> 00:52:52.780]   Okay, um
[00:52:52.780 --> 00:52:56.220]   And then you have an option at least in the beta
[00:52:56.220 --> 00:53:01.500]   To turn on iCloud photo library. Yes, also in beta. Do you recommend that?
[00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:06.780]   You have to go all in you my photo stream is not going anywhere apple said that my photo stream
[00:53:06.780 --> 00:53:10.300]   Which is the one that does the 1000 photos or 30 days is going to stay available
[00:53:10.300 --> 00:53:15.100]   So if you're used to using that you can what iCloud photo library does is it gives you near line capability
[00:53:15.100 --> 00:53:18.700]   So if it's not your main photo library any macbook error or other mac
[00:53:18.700 --> 00:53:24.700]   You have or any iOS device can download optimized versions of the photos that you use most frequently or your favorites
[00:53:24.700 --> 00:53:27.900]   And leave the rest in the cloud and then get bring those to you on demand
[00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:31.740]   And that means that you won't you won't have your entire device clogged up with photos anymore
[00:53:31.900 --> 00:53:35.340]   So it has some advantages. It's much more stable than iCloud has been traditionally
[00:53:35.340 --> 00:53:38.220]   It's based on cloud kit, which knows a very stable framework
[00:53:38.220 --> 00:53:42.780]   Uh, but it is beta. So I you know, don't don't throw your main library in there yet
[00:53:42.780 --> 00:53:49.020]   Too late do it do it everywhere because otherwise it won't sink too late. So now i'm logging and I haven't put i don't have
[00:53:49.020 --> 00:53:51.580]   1033 on this
[00:53:51.580 --> 00:53:53.580]   laptop and I don't have
[00:53:53.580 --> 00:53:56.220]   Obviously i photos, but I do have the photos
[00:53:56.220 --> 00:53:59.020]   beta in my iCloud
[00:54:00.380 --> 00:54:03.740]   Should I open it? You will not blow up nothing will happen
[00:54:03.740 --> 00:54:08.780]   Will I lose everything that I've worked on? Oh, I see it's preparing my library
[00:54:08.780 --> 00:54:11.740]   Uh, and this will work the same on ios
[00:54:11.740 --> 00:54:18.540]   Yep, so and a lot of people are amazed because you really do have all your photos with you on every device
[00:54:18.540 --> 00:54:20.860]   It of course, you depending on how much iCloud stories you have
[00:54:20.860 --> 00:54:23.900]   But if you throw, you know a terabyte ad and just put all your photos in there
[00:54:23.900 --> 00:54:29.420]   They really are just on every device and every edit you make is non-destructive and sync between every device and every favorite is
[00:54:30.220 --> 00:54:33.660]   Actually, it is i'm using it on everything and it's working terrifically
[00:54:33.660 --> 00:54:37.100]   Well, I know some people have had a few issues with it here there and apple's following up with them
[00:54:37.100 --> 00:54:40.460]   But it's been great for me. I don't even i don't even worry about my photos where they are
[00:54:40.460 --> 00:54:43.660]   Well, I don't worry about the butt photos anymore because you delete them in one place
[00:54:43.660 --> 00:54:46.300]   They delete them across the board right i hope remember leo
[00:54:46.300 --> 00:54:48.860]   Deleted photos album for 30 days
[00:54:48.860 --> 00:54:52.220]   Don't look at and then delete them again then delete them
[00:54:52.220 --> 00:54:57.020]   Can we get some clarification are you talking about photos taken by sitting down with your butt?
[00:54:57.020 --> 00:54:59.020]   Yeah, that's what i meant of your butt
[00:54:59.580 --> 00:55:01.660]   Who would take photos of their behind?
[00:55:01.660 --> 00:55:05.260]   There's a selfie stick for that. Well, let's let's do a google image search
[00:55:05.260 --> 00:55:08.460]   Yeah, we we might get some hits
[00:55:08.460 --> 00:55:11.340]   Oopsies
[00:55:11.340 --> 00:55:16.540]   Apparently didn't delete them everywhere. Okay, so um good to know good to know
[00:55:16.540 --> 00:55:19.260]   It hasn't been as fat the jason close your eyes
[00:55:19.260 --> 00:55:24.300]   Only jason said that library hasn't been as fast as thinking for me as photo stream was it
[00:55:24.300 --> 00:55:26.460]   Sometimes takes a little while for the sync to happen
[00:55:26.940 --> 00:55:31.820]   But the you know, this is kind of cool. So now i'm working on the web in here. Can I edit this?
[00:55:31.820 --> 00:55:35.420]   I don't believe there's any editing tools available. No, I don't see I see
[00:55:35.420 --> 00:55:37.820]   I can make it bigger or smaller
[00:55:37.820 --> 00:55:43.020]   Um, I can hard it. I can download it. So if I had photos on here, I could
[00:55:43.020 --> 00:55:45.740]   Modify it. That's cool
[00:55:45.740 --> 00:55:49.260]   Yeah, and I actually think I cropped this but I maybe I didn't
[00:55:49.260 --> 00:55:51.580]   Um, maybe I didn't save the crop
[00:55:51.580 --> 00:55:55.180]   I'm not sure if it if it if it respects all like again though, it's all very beta
[00:55:55.180 --> 00:56:00.060]   I'm not sure if the web viewer yeah honors all the edits that you make how much is a terabyte? Let's say of storage
[00:56:00.060 --> 00:56:03.580]   I forget the price. I think it's
[00:56:03.580 --> 00:56:09.020]   999 for half a terabyte and 1999 for a terabyte, but I'm I'd have to download that yeah
[00:56:09.020 --> 00:56:09.900]   Yeah
[00:56:09.900 --> 00:56:13.660]   Yeah, the one thing is there's still one competitive at all with anyone else when it comes to well
[00:56:13.660 --> 00:56:16.460]   I mean there's a few niche boutique players at target specific needs
[00:56:16.460 --> 00:56:21.020]   But if you're talking about the drop boxes or the google drive to the microcell ever have cloud editing. I mean
[00:56:22.060 --> 00:56:26.060]   Google does aviary does it is there they have I work in the I work stuff
[00:56:26.060 --> 00:56:31.660]   Just went public anybody who wants to now whether you have an apple device or not can get a gigabyte of storage and use I work on the cloud for free
[00:56:31.660 --> 00:56:34.220]   So, I mean never say never
[00:56:34.220 --> 00:56:38.860]   Right. I work doesn't have any photo editing yet, but but that but what you're pointing out is that you could
[00:56:38.860 --> 00:56:41.660]   Um, and optimization
[00:56:41.660 --> 00:56:43.980]   Does what does it reduce the resolution?
[00:56:43.980 --> 00:56:47.740]   Yeah, so if you want to on your main mac or if you have a lot of room
[00:56:47.740 --> 00:56:51.020]   You can make sure that you keep the original version of a file even if it's a raw photograph
[00:56:51.020 --> 00:56:53.340]   On your on the cloud and on the device
[00:56:53.340 --> 00:56:57.260]   But if you want to maintain if you want to keep storage minimum storage requirements low
[00:56:57.260 --> 00:57:02.540]   You can optimize it and that means that it'll bring down a screen size resolution version and keep the original on the cloud for you
[00:57:02.540 --> 00:57:05.660]   And it'll do more moving stuff around back and forth and I
[00:57:05.660 --> 00:57:10.780]   Serenity checked and when you do delete the photo locally
[00:57:10.780 --> 00:57:16.780]   It says delete from all devices this photo will be leaked from all your devices. There's no way to delete it just locally
[00:57:17.500 --> 00:57:19.500]   We're still following up on that
[00:57:19.500 --> 00:57:21.820]   They want to they very much want to manage it for you
[00:57:21.820 --> 00:57:25.660]   So when you have something like when you have a near line system and it's a word that you use in databases a lot
[00:57:25.660 --> 00:57:29.740]   But it's not it's not consumer driven first and apple did this with itunes match as well
[00:57:29.740 --> 00:57:34.700]   They basically are going to determine the photos you access the most the ones you favorite and the ones you do more recently
[00:57:34.700 --> 00:57:37.580]   And put those on your phone and leave the other ones in the cloud
[00:57:37.580 --> 00:57:42.620]   And they don't want you messing with that sort of algorithm by arbitrarily deleting things that they're trying to download or upload
[00:57:42.620 --> 00:57:46.220]   Uh in the background. It's like a fusion drive. They're trying to manage all that for you
[00:57:46.380 --> 00:57:51.100]   It's almost like saying I want to delete this from the ssd but not the hdd in my fusion drive to them
[00:57:51.100 --> 00:57:53.740]   It's one logical volume got it on it
[00:57:53.740 --> 00:57:56.380]   Photo stream has not gone away
[00:57:56.380 --> 00:58:03.180]   Is or is just going to replace it maybe eventually but apple said they're going to keep my photo stream around for a long time to come
[00:58:03.180 --> 00:58:04.700]   Oh, all right
[00:58:04.700 --> 00:58:09.340]   And that family sharing the photo sharing is nice that that feature will continue then as well
[00:58:09.340 --> 00:58:11.660]   Yeah, yeah, I like that
[00:58:11.660 --> 00:58:17.820]   and then uh, I highly recommend imore.com because runny's got a review of all the editing tools and
[00:58:17.820 --> 00:58:21.740]   Some great pictures of her roller derby career
[00:58:21.740 --> 00:58:28.300]   She's doing a column one at every Tuesday. She's doing another aspect of the photography good timing. I like Tuesday. Yeah
[00:58:28.300 --> 00:58:33.180]   Uh, and you could still uh print books and calendars
[00:58:33.180 --> 00:58:37.260]   Not in ios but you could do it in the desktop app
[00:58:37.820 --> 00:58:42.060]   Yeah, the photos the photos that app for mac and i have a whole bunch of new things including squares that are
[00:58:42.060 --> 00:58:47.820]   Um, you know like like the instagram generation of photos square prints. Yes, that's kind of yeah
[00:58:47.820 --> 00:58:49.900]   Yeah, and they have a new feature that's really cool
[00:58:49.900 --> 00:58:54.620]   It'll just automatically you set a size and it'll automatically fit all photos to that size on one of the edges on me
[00:58:54.620 --> 00:58:56.540]   That's neat
[00:58:56.540 --> 00:59:00.860]   Friends everyone who hasn't printed books and i've done a couple of them. They are big
[00:59:00.860 --> 00:59:03.340]   family, uh, you know
[00:59:03.340 --> 00:59:08.220]   And apple you a lot of a lot of credit for those and so easy apple contracts with somebody to do this
[00:59:08.220 --> 00:59:10.220]   But they do but they're really good
[00:59:10.220 --> 00:59:13.180]   It's so easy to throw one together. You know i've done ones for birth
[00:59:13.180 --> 00:59:16.380]   You know when when my kids were born i've done ones on vacation
[00:59:16.380 --> 00:59:19.820]   You just take a bunch of photos and you i mean literally i'd be in the evening
[00:59:19.820 --> 00:59:23.100]   I'd throw them a couple more pages together while hum-hong vacations what i do
[00:59:23.100 --> 00:59:24.540]   And um
[00:59:24.540 --> 00:59:29.020]   And then you're done and you send it out before you get on the plane and by the time you get home like a day or two later
[00:59:29.020 --> 00:59:31.500]   There's the book. You know, it's great. It's great. I love it
[00:59:32.140 --> 00:59:36.460]   And i have tried other services that print books and the quality varies widely
[00:59:36.460 --> 00:59:41.020]   So and it's more it's more clunky. I have to say that there's just none none that are as easy
[00:59:41.020 --> 00:59:46.220]   And i've tried a bunch of them because i want to you know test them and uh haven't found one is smooth and as easy
[00:59:46.220 --> 00:59:51.340]   But if you haven't done it and you do a lot of stuff in iPhoto i would definitely suggest printing a little one and you'll get kind of addicted
[00:59:51.340 --> 00:59:53.180]   Yeah
[00:59:53.180 --> 00:59:54.220]   Yeah
[00:59:54.220 --> 00:59:56.540]   And and the prints are just the qualities just superb
[00:59:56.540 --> 01:00:00.140]   I used to know who they use for their i don't know who they use now
[01:00:00.140 --> 01:00:03.420]   But i haven't done any prints at all just books. So i don't know how the prints
[01:00:03.420 --> 01:00:06.140]   I think i said the book is really just bound prints
[01:00:06.140 --> 01:00:07.820]   Right
[01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:08.460]   Right
[01:00:08.460 --> 01:00:09.660]   So
[01:00:09.660 --> 01:00:11.340]   I know I sent some to my mom and she was happy
[01:00:11.340 --> 01:00:14.540]   Oh, there's like it's not a real photo until it's printed. Yeah, yeah
[01:00:14.540 --> 01:00:17.260]   I sent her one of those things those pieces of paper
[01:00:17.260 --> 01:00:20.300]   We tried some you know, I think i think lisa had a coupon for some
[01:00:20.300 --> 01:00:24.140]   I can't remember the name of it some other photo book printing service
[01:00:24.140 --> 01:00:26.700]   So it was just very disappointing
[01:00:26.940 --> 01:00:30.620]   It felt like it was all low res images and stuff get used use the apple stuff
[01:00:30.620 --> 01:00:37.260]   If you've got it be it be great if they if there was some sort of service that would say we will give you the first one way below cost
[01:00:37.260 --> 01:00:43.740]   Because the thing that that always that made me always timid about that stuff is that the minimum buying is something like 28
[01:00:43.740 --> 01:00:46.140]   Like 30 dollars for like a hardcover book
[01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:50.620]   And so many times i'll get prints back even if I just spend a dollar 80 for prints like, okay
[01:00:50.620 --> 01:00:55.420]   That's not as intense as it was on my monitor. I've said it's not that's not what i wanted. Isn't it?
[01:00:55.420 --> 01:01:00.700]   Yeah, and you don't want to spend I just spent 35 dollars on something that I really just have to kind of chuck in the trash now
[01:01:00.700 --> 01:01:03.500]   You know, we've been doing is metal prints
[01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:09.180]   And really they're not printed on metal. I don't think I think or maybe they are I don't know, but they're great
[01:01:09.180 --> 01:01:14.460]   They're just metal the glass ones are nice too. The glass. Yeah. Yeah, I don't how are they doing that?
[01:01:14.460 --> 01:01:18.060]   Are they printing out a film and then putting it putting it on the glass or no?
[01:01:18.060 --> 01:01:20.940]   I really like them. It's fun
[01:01:21.420 --> 01:01:25.820]   Because people are using photos on glass now. So it's kind of a weird juxtaposition of the real world in the virtual world
[01:01:25.820 --> 01:01:29.740]   Metallic prints really look great. And so when we have a special photo
[01:01:29.740 --> 01:01:34.380]   We'll print it on metal that way after the zombie apocalypse something of us will live on
[01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:38.620]   You can use it as a weapon in the zombie apocalypse. Yeah, you can cut a zombie with that. Oh, it totally can't
[01:01:38.620 --> 01:01:44.620]   You totally can't but then crack addicts are gonna burp in your house to seal your pictures to reclaim the metal for recycling
[01:01:44.620 --> 01:01:48.700]   No, no, that's the mad max universe. That's a different universe
[01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:52.140]   Zombie mad box
[01:01:52.140 --> 01:01:58.780]   Just when you when you when you hear them pulling the siding off the walls and outside then you know
[01:01:58.780 --> 01:02:01.420]   Time to hide the photos
[01:02:01.420 --> 01:02:06.860]   Are sure they brought to you by gazelle if you're ready you're getting ready
[01:02:06.860 --> 01:02:11.820]   You want to be trying to get some money together so you can buy yourself that nice edition watch
[01:02:11.820 --> 01:02:15.340]   Or maybe you see a phone you'd like or a tablet
[01:02:15.900 --> 01:02:22.940]   Time to go to gazelle.com there the folks will give you a top dollar for your existing phone so you can buy a new one
[01:02:22.940 --> 01:02:26.300]   They buy I for even buy broken iPhones and iPads
[01:02:26.300 --> 01:02:30.380]   They'll also buy Samsung they'll buy blackberries. They'll buy
[01:02:30.380 --> 01:02:37.100]   Surface tablets google tablets pretty broad range of things go to gazelle.com
[01:02:37.100 --> 01:02:40.700]   You know, there's no obligation so it's easy to find out what your stuff's worth
[01:02:40.700 --> 01:02:43.580]   In fact, it's guaranteed that price for 30 days
[01:02:43.580 --> 01:02:49.340]   So you can even you know take your time deciding maybe waiting till I don't know an apple watch comes out
[01:02:49.340 --> 01:02:54.220]   How long before they buy apple watches on the gazelle side? I wonder
[01:02:54.220 --> 01:02:59.340]   Probably pretty quickly the next thing is you can not only trade in your old stuff get top dollar
[01:02:59.340 --> 01:03:01.820]   By the way, they turn it around fast. They pay the shipping
[01:03:01.820 --> 01:03:06.700]   If you forget to wipe your data or you can't because it's broken. They'll do that for you. Don't worry
[01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:11.740]   Um, you can get a PayPal credit, which is almost instant you can get a check mail to you
[01:03:11.740 --> 01:03:15.500]   But the best thing to do I would get the Amazon gift cards because they bump those up by 5%
[01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:22.220]   And then after you sell all your stuff time to buy the new stuff gazelle now sells the best the cream of the crop
[01:03:22.220 --> 01:03:24.140]   on the trade-ins
[01:03:24.140 --> 01:03:26.780]   They with their certified pre-owned
[01:03:26.780 --> 01:03:30.140]   Products there's there's two categories
[01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:35.980]   Certified like new which is new basically somebody got something and they never used it or whatever
[01:03:35.980 --> 01:03:39.900]   And then there's certified good. They may show a little gentle signs of wear
[01:03:40.220 --> 01:03:44.860]   But uh, you get even better savings on those and and one thing I know all the devices
[01:03:44.860 --> 01:03:51.660]   Of either quality but put through that rigorous 30 point inspection. So they are working fully there in every respect
[01:03:51.660 --> 01:03:55.900]   Doing great and you of course have a 30 day risk-free return policy
[01:03:55.900 --> 01:04:02.780]   So there's no risk involved in and if you lose a device, you don't want to go out and buy buy it again for full retail go to gazelle
[01:04:02.780 --> 01:04:08.220]   Gazelle.com they buy they sell they're called gazelle

[01:04:48.140 --> 01:04:50.860]   Yeah, you look as always you look fabulous
[01:04:50.860 --> 01:04:55.020]   It's as if it's like johnny applecy for bandwidth whatever Alex goes
[01:04:55.020 --> 01:04:58.300]   bandwidth improves
[01:04:58.300 --> 01:05:03.580]   You understand that that's a requirement of it's around mac break that that I have to know where the good bandwidth is on tuesday
[01:05:03.660 --> 01:05:08.620]   You know, we when I was in when I was in roan a couple weeks ago. I made them install an internet jack
[01:05:08.620 --> 01:05:15.820]   Into the hotel room because it was oh m g. That's what I said. They said I said on the website. It says
[01:05:15.820 --> 01:05:21.180]   Hardline and you didn't and there's no hard line here. It's because i'm guy came in and put it in but but it was uh,
[01:05:21.180 --> 01:05:24.460]   But yeah, so it's not by accident. We picked carefully
[01:05:24.460 --> 01:05:30.860]   Um apple pay fraud one wouldn't think it's possible
[01:05:31.660 --> 01:05:36.780]   Experts say it's a haven for rampant credit card fraud, but this is the register
[01:05:36.780 --> 01:05:42.060]   Writing I spent most of yesterday trying to track that story down. Is it true?
[01:05:42.060 --> 01:05:47.500]   It's what's going on. It was not just a register a recode the story about that the guardian wall street journal just put their version live
[01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:51.900]   So basically what's happening is there's a standard social engineering attack that people use on banks
[01:05:51.900 --> 01:05:59.580]   It's a either identity theft or they get fraudulent cards approved and then they go on buying sprees the difference now is that they're taking those cards and adding it to apple pay
[01:05:59.580 --> 01:06:04.140]   And then going on their buying spree. So it apple pay is 10. That apple pays fault
[01:06:04.140 --> 01:06:09.580]   No, in fact apple pay is so secure the only way you can attack it currently that we know of is to trick a bank
[01:06:09.580 --> 01:06:15.340]   Into authorizing you and the problem is that you know apple will we'll send the device ID the last four numbers of your credit card
[01:06:15.340 --> 01:06:19.500]   Your telephone number your last few transactions and other information from your account
[01:06:19.500 --> 01:06:25.500]   In an encrypted way to the bank that already has that information but they want you to be able to compare the device information
[01:06:25.820 --> 01:06:30.940]   What the people are saying basically with what they have and the bank can check that and they can choose to immediately approve it
[01:06:30.940 --> 01:06:35.980]   Demand a call demand a visit they have all sorts of things and some banks just chose not to do anything with it
[01:06:35.980 --> 01:06:39.580]   So they were subject to again the same kind of fraud attacks that they have over there
[01:06:39.580 --> 01:06:43.660]   Anything else but apple pay makes for a better headline. So this is really bs in fact
[01:06:43.660 --> 01:06:50.460]   At the end of the article they point out that every other mobile payment system including currency and samsung's loop pay
[01:06:50.460 --> 01:06:53.100]   We'll have exactly the same potential risks
[01:06:53.820 --> 01:06:56.540]   Because it's not the apple pay that's been cracked
[01:06:56.540 --> 01:06:59.260]   It's the bank's authentication process
[01:06:59.260 --> 01:07:02.700]   Which they're not using the resources available to them the same way they don't do it
[01:07:02.700 --> 01:07:06.220]   If you may if you take if you fill in a form and send it to them and they send you a card without checking it
[01:07:06.220 --> 01:07:09.900]   You're no more liable than you would be for anything for a credit card either
[01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:12.060]   I mean, it's the same thing if the bank has bad
[01:07:12.060 --> 01:07:16.700]   You know lack security that doesn't make you more liable because it's apple pay
[01:07:16.700 --> 01:07:21.020]   I mean there was a suggestion that you could buy more expensive things because retailers trust apple pay more
[01:07:21.020 --> 01:07:25.020]   But again the retailers can escalate the same way they can with any purchase if it's out of pattern
[01:07:25.020 --> 01:07:29.740]   They can require a phone call they can require a check a physical card check and they do that already
[01:07:29.740 --> 01:07:31.900]   It's just they have to make sure that they've all those practices
[01:07:31.900 --> 01:07:36.700]   So it really comes from this one guy charion abraham a mobile payment specialist
[01:07:36.700 --> 01:07:40.700]   Who says fraud enabled by apple pay is rampant
[01:07:40.700 --> 01:07:46.220]   And the banks are the banks were shocked according to one article shocked that this was possible shocked
[01:07:47.020 --> 01:07:51.740]   Because they've never seen anything like that before fraud, you know and and this specific kind of fraud
[01:07:51.740 --> 01:07:56.460]   Criminal gangs are handing smartphones to low ranking members who use them to commit fraud
[01:07:56.460 --> 01:07:59.020]   Particularly at apple stores
[01:07:59.020 --> 01:08:05.820]   So it could be the crooks are buying high-end iPhones with it could be not this is just like i'll just make something up
[01:08:05.820 --> 01:08:11.500]   That crooks are buying high-end iPhones with embedded payment features in order to further the fraud
[01:08:11.500 --> 01:08:12.860]   I think that's irks about this though
[01:08:12.860 --> 01:08:15.820]   Is that apple published all the stuff that they do for apple pay to make it secure?
[01:08:15.820 --> 01:08:22.380]   And it doesn't look like any of the articles just did the basic research of looking at the website before publishing well, and it's serious people yeah
[01:08:22.380 --> 01:08:26.300]   They're all pointing out apple pay has not been cracked
[01:08:26.300 --> 01:08:31.180]   Not absolutely on apple pay
[01:08:31.180 --> 01:08:37.740]   Although you might be able to dazzle. I think maybe you dazzle the clerk by uh, well you have an edition watch you should be able to
[01:08:37.740 --> 01:08:39.740]   buy anything
[01:08:39.740 --> 01:08:43.340]   Yeah, may just pass that over your your silly terminal. Ah
[01:08:45.180 --> 01:08:50.140]   Also nfc transactions have been around for a couple years. So it this this this is a battle harden technology
[01:08:50.140 --> 01:08:55.260]   And if there were a flaw and they all use pretty much the same system even samson's
[01:08:55.260 --> 01:09:00.140]   Uh new samson pay system uses pretty much the same system where you you get you get a burner
[01:09:00.140 --> 01:09:02.300]   Uh credit card number every time you use it
[01:09:02.300 --> 01:09:05.500]   So it's it's that's not the weak point of this whole thing as usual
[01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:10.220]   The weakest point in any financial services thing is the dope at the end of the customer service line, right?
[01:09:10.220 --> 01:09:13.500]   Oh, of course. We will say of course we'll send you a new okay. I'm sorry. That's all right
[01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:17.740]   We will but tomorrow be fast enough to activate your new account link to this the earl bank account
[01:09:17.740 --> 01:09:22.220]   And again, you're not liable the bank is liable
[01:09:22.220 --> 01:09:24.620]   uh particularly for that dopey
[01:09:24.620 --> 01:09:29.740]   I'm trying to find the 18 page. Maybe they didn't put it online the 18 pages of
[01:09:29.740 --> 01:09:32.940]   beauty shots of the apple watch and vogue
[01:09:32.940 --> 01:09:37.660]   Did they not the few they're just a few yeah, I guess I'll have to buy a vogue
[01:09:38.940 --> 01:09:42.060]   Isn't it interesting that all of this stuff is in vote like vote
[01:09:42.060 --> 01:09:47.020]   No, it's in self magazine. Um, so I get in a sporty context. Yeah
[01:09:47.020 --> 01:09:49.980]   Where they know they're marketing
[01:09:49.980 --> 01:09:54.860]   Well, it shows like one of the interesting things about the watch to me and not to digress back to that topic is that there's multiple ways
[01:09:54.860 --> 01:09:56.620]   Like you have the sport version, right?
[01:09:56.620 --> 01:09:59.820]   There are a lot of people who love athletic watches and they get dive watches only different things
[01:09:59.820 --> 01:10:05.500]   And they're they're appealing to that and some people like high end watches and some people just want notifications and some want authentication
[01:10:05.500 --> 01:10:07.980]   Is there's a lot of different ways that could appeal to different people?
[01:10:08.060 --> 01:10:13.580]   Yeah, yeah, um, apple passes sam sangh in uh q4
[01:10:13.580 --> 01:10:16.860]   smartphone sales
[01:10:16.860 --> 01:10:19.340]   This is some uh good news
[01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:22.620]   Boy, this is mind-boggin. These are this is global by the way
[01:10:22.620 --> 01:10:26.300]   1.9 billion mobile phones were sold in q4
[01:10:26.300 --> 01:10:32.380]   Oh, no, I'm sorry overall in 2014. Okay. That's a little better not in a quarter, but in all 12 months
[01:10:32.380 --> 01:10:35.100]   uh, so uh
[01:10:35.100 --> 01:10:37.020]   That's pretty impressive sam sangh
[01:10:37.420 --> 01:10:42.700]   Isn't that 1.9 billion almost almost one out of three people in the world bought a phone most of those
[01:10:42.700 --> 01:10:47.100]   I'm willing to better not high end expensive phones most of those are the inexpensive phones
[01:10:47.100 --> 01:10:50.780]   Microsoft's been focusing on those with its windows phone market
[01:10:50.780 --> 01:10:56.300]   You mentioned rene the moto the new second generation moto e which is only a hundred fifty nine dollars
[01:10:56.300 --> 01:11:00.620]   Unsubsidized and is really pretty much everything the moto x was
[01:11:00.620 --> 01:11:03.340]   Um, well, not everything
[01:11:04.060 --> 01:11:09.580]   The the moto g and the moto e are great and that they remind us that premium smartphones are premium smart fries
[01:11:09.580 --> 01:11:15.740]   And that you can get but you can get by just fine with a moto g and not miss a whole lot of uh, what you'd be getting with a
[01:11:15.740 --> 01:11:21.260]   With a better phone. I'm comfortable with the e is you want to especially, you know, if it's your first phone or a kid or you don't have a
[01:11:21.260 --> 01:11:25.420]   Lot of money the e compared to what you used to get yeah for a hundred fifty bucks. It gives you an off
[01:11:25.420 --> 01:11:26.860]   This is a second generation
[01:11:26.860 --> 01:11:31.740]   And once you stop just simply being a well, I have an account with verizon i've or account with
[01:11:32.060 --> 01:11:38.060]   AT&T I simply replaced my phone every two years and I use the data plans they give me once you start shopping around you can
[01:11:38.060 --> 01:11:41.740]   You'll be shocked at how much money you're spending that you don't necessarily have to be spending
[01:11:41.740 --> 01:11:48.860]   If you go on like t-mobile or some other different plan that are aggressively trying to get people to break out of like 10
[01:11:48.860 --> 01:11:54.140]   Year old service habits not contracts, but service habits and get new customers
[01:11:54.140 --> 01:11:58.860]   So uh last in the fourth calendar quarter the holiday buying quarter
[01:11:59.500 --> 01:12:03.580]   Globally 367.5 million devices were sold
[01:12:03.580 --> 01:12:10.780]   Of those as we know apple sold 75 million sam song only 73 million
[01:12:10.780 --> 01:12:17.340]   Uh, a quarter for apple though. Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's such an app. What is it? It's an aberration
[01:12:17.340 --> 01:12:23.580]   Uh, I'm sorry. I it's possible that that's an aberration because there is so much pent up demand for
[01:12:23.580 --> 01:12:29.420]   Pent pent up consumer expectation for a larger screen iphone. Yeah, it'll be interesting to see what the
[01:12:29.980 --> 01:12:34.300]   How the iphone seven uh sells assuming they're making one of course that is an unknown product
[01:12:34.300 --> 01:12:39.820]   Into the hot sounds Andy market share, you know, so phones sold up to that point including that quarter
[01:12:39.820 --> 01:12:45.820]   Uh sam's not still has a wide lead 29.5 to apples 17.8
[01:12:45.820 --> 01:12:49.900]   Lenovo 5.8 while way which is sold
[01:12:49.900 --> 01:12:55.580]   Pretty much mostly in China. I think 5.7. Shao me 2 and others
[01:12:56.620 --> 01:13:02.220]   The biggest category 39.3. There are lots of other people in this business even though we don't see them
[01:13:02.220 --> 01:13:04.780]   And market share is just one metric. I remember when palm
[01:13:04.780 --> 01:13:09.740]   Price the central to sell at every one of those cost the money and it was almost debilitating when they sold up
[01:13:09.740 --> 01:13:14.460]   A large number of them apple makes such good profits that even if they don't have a market share advantage
[01:13:14.460 --> 01:13:18.300]   They have a huge profit share advantage and they might count customer satisfaction or web usage or some
[01:13:18.300 --> 01:13:23.100]   Some other metric just as highly. I'm sorry. I apologize. I was reading the four
[01:13:23.660 --> 01:13:28.620]   13 market share. I completely reversed now. So that was that was a year ago
[01:13:28.620 --> 01:13:31.260]   This year apple 20 percent of the market
[01:13:31.260 --> 01:13:34.860]   Samsung 19 percent of the market just a few
[01:13:34.860 --> 01:13:40.380]   Half a percent dividing the two for this quarter for the quarter
[01:13:40.380 --> 01:13:44.220]   That's right. Yeah, but that includes all unit. I don't know if that's unit sold
[01:13:44.220 --> 01:13:48.940]   Oh, maybe it is. Yeah, it's unit sold. It's hard because not everyone declares units the same way
[01:13:48.940 --> 01:13:52.300]   Not everyone breaks them out. Some are sell in some are sell through it's really a mess
[01:13:52.860 --> 01:13:59.660]   Yeah, it's it's even more impressive when you start to come you realize that the android phone market isn't one market the way that the iPhone market is
[01:13:59.660 --> 01:14:04.140]   It really is about three four or five. There are people who are buying android 2.3
[01:14:04.140 --> 01:14:10.620]   Practically disposable phones. There are people who are buying service phones and then they're the people who are buying the iPhone like
[01:14:10.620 --> 01:14:16.140]   Really big impressive smartphones. So it's it's hard to really break it down into market share that way
[01:14:16.140 --> 01:14:17.820]   It's anyway slice
[01:14:17.820 --> 01:14:22.620]   It's it's hard to find a way to look at apple sales of iPhones and not say nope
[01:14:22.620 --> 01:14:25.660]   That's exactly the way that I would like to be in business. Yeah, no kidding
[01:14:25.660 --> 01:14:30.220]   for the whole year 2014 Samsung sold 307
[01:14:30.220 --> 01:14:31.900]   597
[01:14:31.900 --> 01:14:33.020]   thousand
[01:14:33.020 --> 01:14:37.660]   Units apple sold 191 million iPhones in one year
[01:14:37.660 --> 01:14:39.980]   Wow
[01:14:39.980 --> 01:14:44.620]   Lenovo 81,000 wal-y68. I'm sorry 81 million wal-y68 million
[01:14:45.580 --> 01:14:48.620]   LG 57 million, but still the the little guys
[01:14:48.620 --> 01:14:53.100]   sold far more that right there that you were just showing off just
[01:14:53.100 --> 01:14:59.180]   Illustrates what a bad year it was for Samsung right 30 market share in 2013
[01:14:59.180 --> 01:15:05.260]   24 a year later 24 a year later and all of that went into the other category which right now
[01:15:05.260 --> 01:15:09.180]   That's a good point. Jason. How makes a very good point others did well
[01:15:09.180 --> 01:15:14.860]   You know it's the low-end market though that really is is beefing up market shit. Yeah. Yeah, show me and
[01:15:15.660 --> 01:15:23.580]   Well, not even show me interesting to see things like the what is that the the yep phone or whatever there's this
[01:15:23.580 --> 01:15:28.540]   Yeah local entrance. They're very small phone companies all over the all over the world
[01:15:28.540 --> 01:15:33.100]   If you talk about operating system in 2014
[01:15:33.100 --> 01:15:35.980]   1 billion android devices were sold
[01:15:35.980 --> 01:15:38.780]   and of course 191 million
[01:15:38.780 --> 01:15:44.060]   iOS devices 35 million windows phones 7.9 million
[01:15:44.860 --> 01:15:50.620]   Blackberries in 20 the the orange thing to me is to look at how many total units sold across all platforms
[01:15:50.620 --> 01:15:53.100]   Across all sellers basically
[01:15:53.100 --> 01:15:55.740]   200 and 44
[01:15:55.740 --> 01:15:59.980]   But basically look look at look at the number on the left and the temperature on the on the right
[01:15:59.980 --> 01:16:03.580]   That a lot of people came into this marketplace at the same at the same time
[01:16:03.580 --> 01:16:07.340]   And when you look at it's kind of impressive that Samsung
[01:16:07.340 --> 01:16:13.900]   Did not pick up any of those people no sales pretty much it's not that it's not the just the percentage went down
[01:16:14.140 --> 01:16:16.140]   If you look at the number of how many they sold
[01:16:16.140 --> 01:16:21.420]   Lots of new people came into the market and Samsung got almost none of the phone that they saw phones
[01:16:21.420 --> 01:16:27.260]   They released in 2014 they went from 300 million to 307 million. Yeah
[01:16:27.260 --> 01:16:31.260]   uh, but boy a lot of phones sold 1.2
[01:16:31.260 --> 01:16:36.700]   Really 1 1.2 4 billion phones sold in 2014
[01:16:36.700 --> 01:16:39.340]   It's hard to wrap your
[01:16:39.340 --> 01:16:46.220]   Eyes your head around the idea of 1.2 billion of anything being manufactured and sold that it's not like a cheeseburger or
[01:16:46.220 --> 01:16:48.700]   You know a coke a can of coke. Yeah
[01:16:48.700 --> 01:16:50.780]   Wow
[01:16:50.780 --> 01:16:55.500]   It's a good business nice work if you can get it. I'll tell you on that Leo enterprise share
[01:16:55.500 --> 01:16:59.660]   I made the wrong choice by choosing to manufacture words and ideas instead of actual
[01:16:59.660 --> 01:17:02.780]   And it's hard to charge for words and ideas. That's the problem
[01:17:02.780 --> 01:17:05.420]   Uh, in enterprise ios
[01:17:06.140 --> 01:17:12.780]   73 percent enterprise share in q4 android dropping to 25 percent windows phone flat at 1 percent
[01:17:12.780 --> 01:17:16.700]   Um, that's kind of interesting. Isn't it now is that that's global. Yeah
[01:17:16.700 --> 01:17:22.780]   So 73 of global device activations in enterprise in q4
[01:17:22.780 --> 01:17:28.780]   Where ios isn't that interesting? Is that the ibm deal or is that just the way it's why there's an ibm deal?
[01:17:28.780 --> 01:17:34.620]   Yeah, it's why there's an ibm deal. Yeah, well and and I think it's interesting because I think it went when that when it started
[01:17:35.260 --> 01:17:38.300]   There was a real question of whether apple is going to be able to get into the enterprise
[01:17:38.300 --> 01:17:39.260]   It was a lot of yeah
[01:17:39.260 --> 01:17:42.380]   To it that and people weren't sure if this was going to be a successful market for them
[01:17:42.380 --> 01:17:47.260]   And they've obviously uh turned that around to the point where blackberry is in the other category
[01:17:47.260 --> 01:17:49.420]   I'm blackberry
[01:17:49.420 --> 01:17:53.660]   Historically apple's not done well in enterprise byod changed everything
[01:17:53.660 --> 01:17:58.700]   It buyers are no longer the ones responsible right decision right when the end users get to choose
[01:17:58.700 --> 01:18:01.500]   They choose ios
[01:18:02.140 --> 01:18:06.060]   That's uh ben tomsen's famous thing about buying for experience and not buying for checklist
[01:18:06.060 --> 01:18:08.220]   Yeah, yeah
[01:18:08.220 --> 01:18:12.380]   I had somebody in the studio the other day and he had a blackberry
[01:18:12.380 --> 01:18:14.860]   um bold
[01:18:14.860 --> 01:18:20.220]   As well as a more recent samsung, uh, I think a note for I said, what are you what are you doing?
[01:18:20.220 --> 01:18:22.220]   The bold he said work gave it to me
[01:18:22.220 --> 01:18:23.580]   This is
[01:18:23.580 --> 01:18:24.940]   Workful
[01:18:24.940 --> 01:18:30.460]   When I was when I was flew out there last time I was in the plane and all the seats around me were taken over by a company
[01:18:30.460 --> 01:18:36.700]   That was flying out from meetings and all of them had Lenovo laptops running windows 7 and blackberry
[01:18:36.700 --> 01:18:42.940]   Blackberry zed 30s, but they all also had iPhones which was an really odd combination
[01:18:42.940 --> 01:18:46.380]   apple launching a new ad campaign saying
[01:18:46.380 --> 01:18:51.900]   Our camera phone is the best shot on iphone 6 you want to see the pictures they are
[01:18:51.900 --> 01:18:55.580]   Gorgeous and hard to believe they're captured with a phone
[01:18:57.500 --> 01:19:02.940]   They're amazing. It's a lot of those are really amazing photographers. I mean this yeah, that is gorgeous. It's it's
[01:19:02.940 --> 01:19:06.700]   This said that was with the with visco cam
[01:19:06.700 --> 01:19:10.220]   Yeah, I've always thought that the real strength of
[01:19:10.220 --> 01:19:15.420]   Uh the iphones particularly iphone 6 as a as a camera platform is necessarily the imager
[01:19:15.420 --> 01:19:20.220]   But everything around it like how fast you can launch the app how fast it takes pictures
[01:19:20.220 --> 01:19:24.060]   The way that it puts meat features into the camera app that are actually meaningful
[01:19:24.460 --> 01:19:29.900]   Because these aren't as impressive because you can you can basically give any professional photographer
[01:19:29.900 --> 01:19:32.860]   Even i'm sure you can even give them a moto g
[01:19:32.860 --> 01:19:37.260]   And say we need some great demo photos and they'll know great. I know exactly
[01:19:37.260 --> 01:19:40.620]   I'll go twilight when there isn't a whole lot of difference between light and dark
[01:19:40.620 --> 01:19:45.260]   I'll go to this beautiful place where I know there's a lot of like sub level detail
[01:19:45.260 --> 01:19:49.340]   Uh, it's really is the experience of of holding your hand
[01:19:49.740 --> 01:19:52.220]   Uh, my thoughts really about the iphone 6
[01:19:52.220 --> 01:19:59.420]   Compared to the iphone 5 is that it's the first camera that really feels camera phone that really feels like using a camera
[01:19:59.420 --> 01:20:02.860]   It long past god passed the point where it's taking pictures that are
[01:20:02.860 --> 01:20:04.780]   Uh in many cases as good as a camera
[01:20:04.780 --> 01:20:09.020]   This is the one where I get into the same sort of picture taking mindset with the iphone as I do
[01:20:09.020 --> 01:20:12.300]   Uh with uh any uh conventional camera that I use
[01:20:12.300 --> 01:20:15.980]   That is a big difference uh instead of just thinking oh, i'm going to take a snapshot
[01:20:16.060 --> 01:20:17.660]   This is an insta-matic
[01:20:17.660 --> 01:20:20.940]   You you and I think this is probably part of the reason for this campaign
[01:20:20.940 --> 01:20:24.460]   Uh, you you could say hey now you know, this is actually a good camera
[01:20:24.460 --> 01:20:27.580]   So i'm going to pay more attention and i'm going to do the you know do it
[01:20:27.580 --> 01:20:31.180]   Have you can have high expectations of the work you can get out of it
[01:20:31.180 --> 01:20:32.060]   Right
[01:20:32.060 --> 01:20:36.540]   Do they mention if any this all the stuff is jpeg straight out of the camera or is there any post-processing?
[01:20:36.540 --> 01:20:41.820]   In many cases there is for instance the black and white images. Obviously, this is snap seed
[01:20:41.820 --> 01:20:45.660]   Um, what's on the phone though as far as I know everything else yeah
[01:20:45.660 --> 01:20:49.340]   They're and they're and they're being very upfront like this is all in camera
[01:20:49.340 --> 01:20:53.740]   They tell you the app and the accessories. Yeah, well, so that's nice. I mean they're I think pretty
[01:20:53.740 --> 01:20:57.420]   I don't think it's deceptive. No, no, no, no, but it's like first is I
[01:20:57.420 --> 01:21:00.300]   On my android phones. I just started doing things like well
[01:21:00.300 --> 01:21:06.380]   What if I just shot hdr all the time right as like oh every single picture now comes up much better than it used to be
[01:21:06.380 --> 01:21:08.540]   Right, uh, it really is all about it
[01:21:08.540 --> 01:21:14.940]   Old adage about about cameras and not just the camera itself. It's also knowing how to use it properly
[01:21:15.580 --> 01:21:17.580]   Yeah, I mean a picture like this
[01:21:17.580 --> 01:21:23.580]   It's gorgeous. That's that's a pro. You could tell right. I mean these are pros really gorgeous
[01:21:23.580 --> 01:21:27.260]   That's mgm the biggest soundstage. They've rolled in the club back props
[01:21:27.260 --> 01:21:32.220]   What do we have anything from brigadoon still in storage? We need
[01:21:32.220 --> 01:21:35.980]   There are a couple amateurs and created well, so yeah, no in fact
[01:21:35.980 --> 01:21:42.540]   I'm guessing a lot of these are amateurs because the photo credits are often in fact in no case include their last name
[01:21:43.260 --> 01:21:47.500]   And yeah, they scoured the the social like the instagram from instagram right
[01:21:47.500 --> 01:21:50.540]   Kind of amazing. They are
[01:21:50.540 --> 01:21:55.900]   It's a little deceptive because they're printed so beautifully at such a large size that that makes it look good too
[01:21:55.900 --> 01:22:01.500]   I wouldn't I wouldn't say to such they're showing it off as best as they can this is done with an all-clip macro lens
[01:22:01.500 --> 01:22:02.540]   Isn't that great?
[01:22:02.540 --> 01:22:09.100]   I just think that sometimes this can do more harm than good because I'll tell you why I've I've just got the new olympus
[01:22:09.660 --> 01:22:12.460]   DEM 5 mark 2 that was just released
[01:22:12.460 --> 01:22:14.860]   That just arrived a couple of days ago
[01:22:14.860 --> 01:22:21.020]   And I'm trying to figure out how to take test photos with it because any photos I take with this camera are going to be really
[01:22:21.020 --> 01:22:26.540]   Not tell the story because I've been using the older brother of this for an entire year
[01:22:26.540 --> 01:22:31.340]   And I know how this camera works and also I don't take snapshots. I really
[01:22:31.340 --> 01:22:35.660]   I spend way too much time trying to compose something and getting the lighting right
[01:22:36.060 --> 01:22:39.500]   And so I feel as though I'll be convincing. I think you see a gallery like this
[01:22:39.500 --> 01:22:42.860]   You might then take pictures the way that you take pictures
[01:22:42.860 --> 01:22:47.820]   Then wonder gee how come my sky is like all blown out and how come mine isn't quite so sharp as that?
[01:22:47.820 --> 01:22:49.820]   How come my colors aren't as good?
[01:22:49.820 --> 01:22:50.780]   um
[01:22:50.780 --> 01:22:52.700]   It really I mean the iPhone 6 is
[01:22:52.700 --> 01:22:57.500]   I think the best in class camera you can get when you talk about the entire system
[01:22:57.500 --> 01:23:01.580]   Uh, and so but although I you know, we're starting to see uh, you know
[01:23:01.580 --> 01:23:03.020]   uh
[01:23:03.020 --> 01:23:10.380]   comparisons between the iPhone 6 the note 4 camera and uh, uh, and blind taste at tests and uh, so forth
[01:23:10.380 --> 01:23:15.580]   But it's getting more complicated. It's more complicated. Exactly now that we're getting 16 megapixel
[01:23:15.580 --> 01:23:18.540]   Cameras like as the norm on a lot of android phones
[01:23:18.540 --> 01:23:27.580]   Some of the advantages of of apples post processing is being blunted a little bit by virtue of the fact that this camera is just
[01:23:27.820 --> 01:23:34.220]   Collecting a lot more information than the iPhone camera is despite the fact that the iPhone cameras doing a better job of post processing
[01:23:34.220 --> 01:23:37.900]   So it's going to be interesting next year. I think to see
[01:23:37.900 --> 01:23:42.060]   Because if there's if there's one thing I would love to see in the next iPhone camera
[01:23:42.060 --> 01:23:48.220]   It really is at least 12 megapixels. Yeah, because yeah, they're starting to fall behind aren't they? I mean, uh, it's
[01:23:48.220 --> 01:23:52.460]   They very wisely decided not to play them more megapixels game
[01:23:52.460 --> 01:23:56.220]   But the fact the matter is that if you get I would much rather have a 16 megapixel
[01:23:56.220 --> 01:24:03.260]   Megapixel image that's not quite as good as an eight megapixel image because I can crop down a 16 better
[01:24:03.260 --> 01:24:05.740]   Than I can with an eight right
[01:24:05.740 --> 01:24:08.940]   Well, and I I'm still I still would like to see better low light performance
[01:24:08.940 --> 01:24:12.540]   I think the low light's gotten a lot better in the you know the last iteration
[01:24:12.540 --> 01:24:14.860]   But I I think they could still keep on going that direction
[01:24:14.860 --> 01:24:18.380]   I think that the average person the number one thing that they have trouble with is
[01:24:18.380 --> 01:24:23.980]   Inside taking pictures of their kids or their family or whatever and being grainy or blurry or you know
[01:24:23.980 --> 01:24:28.140]   And it's no accident. These are all taken in daylight outdoors. Yeah, yeah, right
[01:24:28.140 --> 01:24:31.340]   Things like the if they had one button that simply said hi
[01:24:31.340 --> 01:24:34.860]   I'm taking pictures of my hyperactive kid do what you have to do
[01:24:34.860 --> 01:24:37.740]   I think that would lead to so much better photography
[01:24:37.740 --> 01:24:43.660]   Just to say like throw throw detail out the window through exposure out the window just freeze my little kid
[01:24:43.660 --> 01:24:44.860]   Yeah
[01:24:44.860 --> 01:24:49.740]   Still this such a great display apple.com slash iphone slash world dash gallery
[01:24:49.740 --> 01:24:53.740]   Uh, go these are um just gorgeous images and all
[01:24:53.820 --> 01:24:57.980]   Taken well curated too. It's just an it's just a lovely selection of photos. Yeah
[01:24:57.980 --> 01:25:05.980]   It's nicely done. Although remember sam sang at their event made a very big point of comparing shots from the galaxy s6
[01:25:05.980 --> 01:25:08.620]   with the iphone six
[01:25:08.620 --> 01:25:11.580]   But I think I think you really nailed it Andy. It's uh
[01:25:11.580 --> 01:25:17.260]   It's deceptive because you can you can be very aware of a camera's capabilities and and play to them
[01:25:17.260 --> 01:25:20.460]   I don't want to say deceptive because that that that announces intent
[01:25:20.620 --> 01:25:26.460]   I'm saying that I don't want people to get discouraged when they take pictures with their phone and they don't get pictures as good as the one that
[01:25:26.460 --> 01:25:32.300]   As good as the one out of every 1000 that the curator of this collection picked out because they were so impressive
[01:25:32.300 --> 01:25:39.100]   I know that even I even I myself it's gets so discouraging that why why are my shots not as sharp as the ones i'm seeing
[01:25:39.100 --> 01:25:41.180]   Why is mike the color in my shots not as good?
[01:25:41.180 --> 01:25:46.060]   And then you talk to the people who take those pictures they tell you how they got the shot that way and you realize that oh
[01:25:46.540 --> 01:25:52.460]   So it's actual experience and knowledge and practice that helps you out so many of these are just straight from the camera
[01:25:52.460 --> 01:25:54.540]   That's kind of yeah kind of cool
[01:25:54.540 --> 01:25:56.460]   You're a good dog
[01:25:56.460 --> 01:25:58.460]   Who's you?
[01:25:58.460 --> 01:26:03.420]   I can't resist a can yeti. All right. Let's see one of the thing go ahead one of things is that's really
[01:26:03.420 --> 01:26:04.860]   um
[01:26:04.860 --> 01:26:08.380]   Been interesting about this is from the time when we went went from film and in some ways
[01:26:08.380 --> 01:26:10.140]   I always felt like being a film photographer
[01:26:10.140 --> 01:26:13.340]   You know what made you a professional was to be able to afford to buy all that film
[01:26:13.420 --> 01:26:18.780]   I mean, you know, you know the to get a number of iterations right because a photographer would always tell you if they got one or two
[01:26:18.780 --> 01:26:21.580]   Great images out of one roll of film
[01:26:21.580 --> 01:26:23.500]   They'd be they're quite happy with that
[01:26:23.500 --> 01:26:29.660]   And and so when we moved to digital and finally got to a point where we could buy digital cameras that would let us take lots and lots of photos
[01:26:29.660 --> 01:26:33.100]   And it's not just that we could take lots of photos, but we could iterate very quickly
[01:26:33.100 --> 01:26:35.100]   We could see what we did at that moment
[01:26:35.100 --> 01:26:40.220]   And I think that this is the next step and one of the reasons we're going to continue to see better better pictures from these phones
[01:26:40.220 --> 01:26:44.380]   Because it's what we're carrying every day and we're taking pictures all the time
[01:26:44.380 --> 01:26:49.340]   And you know and it's just and I think it and as you keep on looking at it and with a little bit of critical
[01:26:49.340 --> 01:26:54.060]   You know a critical eye and some review. I think a lot of people can become very good photographers
[01:26:54.060 --> 01:26:55.900]   And I think this is just a representation of that. Yeah
[01:26:55.900 --> 01:26:59.100]   Yeah, really it's quite amazing. I mean
[01:26:59.100 --> 01:27:01.580]   No
[01:27:01.580 --> 01:27:04.300]   I remember very well people saying
[01:27:04.300 --> 01:27:10.060]   People saying oh, you know, I'll never shoot digital because it just doesn't carry the same quality and resolution
[01:27:10.060 --> 01:27:11.020]   as film
[01:27:11.020 --> 01:27:14.620]   Oh, how far we've come and now we're at the point. These are camera phone pictures
[01:27:14.620 --> 01:27:18.780]   That absolutely rival film pictures in every respect
[01:27:18.780 --> 01:27:25.580]   You know you make you make fun of people taking selfies you make fun of people using cameras in places where they should be looking at this wonderful vista or whatever
[01:27:25.580 --> 01:27:28.380]   And judging people for it. I would never
[01:27:28.380 --> 01:27:35.900]   What a beautiful thing that so many people are taking pictures as they go and creating art and creating something just as an
[01:27:36.220 --> 01:27:40.700]   Instidental thing not because they're putting on their pith helmet and their tripod and they're $8,000
[01:27:40.700 --> 01:27:42.380]   But just because hey, that looks cool thing
[01:27:42.380 --> 01:27:44.380]   I'll get a picture of it that is just awesome
[01:27:44.380 --> 01:27:48.860]   And who hasn't had that experience of taking a picture then getting back and looking at your iPhone going wow
[01:27:48.860 --> 01:27:54.300]   I got a great one exactly. Yeah, I mean one of the things that I love is my my photo stream is on my
[01:27:54.300 --> 01:27:57.340]   On my tv at home, you know shows up on tv
[01:27:57.340 --> 01:28:03.820]   And when I and I just find it fascinating to come home and you just forget all these different photos that that pop up
[01:28:04.220 --> 01:28:07.820]   You know from the you know from the past and it's it's kind of it is a lot of fun

[01:31:19.900 --> 01:31:23.260]   Kill dolly. I had Alex lindsey
[01:31:23.260 --> 01:31:28.060]   I had a request on twitter as to what I use for time lapse
[01:31:28.060 --> 01:31:32.780]   And um the the app that I've been using the most for time lapse photos is lapse it
[01:31:32.780 --> 01:31:36.940]   Have you have you seen laps it? See I've been using hyper hyper lapse all the time
[01:31:36.940 --> 01:31:38.940]   So I haven't really looked for anything better
[01:31:38.940 --> 01:31:43.180]   Well hyper lapse is great when you're when you're trying when you're taking a video and then compressing it
[01:31:43.180 --> 01:31:46.940]   But you may want to leave it. I don't know if I would use it like sit and uh
[01:31:46.940 --> 01:31:54.300]   I'm sure if I would use I use hyper lapse a lot so I will say that but um, but I like the settings and time lapse or in laps at
[01:31:54.300 --> 01:31:55.660]   I'm sorry and um
[01:31:55.660 --> 01:32:01.260]   And it's just it's a really easy one where you can very quickly build up a you know you set up your settings of exactly
[01:32:01.260 --> 01:32:04.300]   This is more for slowing it down than speeding it up
[01:32:05.180 --> 01:32:09.980]   Well, it'll speed it up because you're setting setting. Oh, I see you're watching a flower bloom or something like that
[01:32:09.980 --> 01:32:13.100]   Yeah, right right so it's and and um
[01:32:13.100 --> 01:32:16.540]   Uh, you know, I've used it for a bunch of time lapses of us building
[01:32:16.540 --> 01:32:19.980]   You know building some of our setups and everything else and and it's just a it's a great one
[01:32:19.980 --> 01:32:21.900]   You just hook your phone to a I hook it to a tripod
[01:32:21.900 --> 01:32:26.700]   I put a little rig and throw it on a tripod and then I and then and I go and the time lapse is good
[01:32:26.700 --> 01:32:30.460]   I I guess I feel like I use time lapse mostly as a quick and easy
[01:32:30.460 --> 01:32:34.860]   I'm just gonna capture something in video and then I'm gonna hold it really still and then I'm going to
[01:32:35.020 --> 01:32:38.940]   Then it's going to turn it into something magical. This one is gives me a lot more control
[01:32:38.940 --> 01:32:42.860]   You know, then then that would then I think that lap then um
[01:32:42.860 --> 01:32:46.620]   Then that gives me so so anyway laps it is the it's um, you know
[01:32:46.620 --> 01:32:52.620]   You have different ways of encoding it and how many frames per second and and you know what the frame intervals are and and you're so
[01:32:52.620 --> 01:32:57.660]   Instead of saying six times faster eight times faster. You're you know able to kind of you know set that up
[01:32:57.660 --> 01:33:03.100]   So so anyway, um now there's a it's free with a buck 99 pro version. What do you get?
[01:33:03.740 --> 01:33:08.940]   If you spend a little more money, does it uh, I don't remember right? I immediately bought it right?
[01:33:08.940 --> 01:33:10.860]   Yeah
[01:33:10.860 --> 01:33:12.620]   Yeah, I do that too. I
[01:33:12.620 --> 01:33:16.780]   You end up with two apps otherwise you buy the one basically and you're like, oh, I just want the pro version
[01:33:16.780 --> 01:33:21.180]   Yeah, so you know, it's usually some little thing but I but I uh I had the pro version for again
[01:33:21.180 --> 01:33:26.220]   It's the price of a coffee not even a cappuccino right price of a copy for the quote-unquote pro version
[01:33:26.220 --> 01:33:28.220]   Yeah, it is is half a coffee there
[01:33:28.220 --> 01:33:33.420]   So so I you know, it's um, that's the that's the best one the one that I've been the most happy with um and again
[01:33:33.420 --> 01:33:35.020]   Yeah, I use I use both of those a lot
[01:33:35.020 --> 01:33:38.940]   But uh, this is the one where I'm trying to like set I'm gonna set it on a tripod and I'm gonna then
[01:33:38.940 --> 01:33:45.340]   Capture whatever we're gonna capture for the next hour or two. Um, you know, this has been a great solution lapse it
[01:33:45.340 --> 01:33:47.740]   lapse it calm
[01:33:47.740 --> 01:33:49.900]   And they have an android version too. So that's nice
[01:33:49.900 --> 01:33:53.740]   Renee richy. What do you got for us? I got a couple things
[01:33:53.740 --> 01:33:56.860]   I'm pretty sure I didn't pick this previously it came out a couple weeks ago
[01:33:56.860 --> 01:34:01.500]   But it's the new version of calc bot from tap bots, which was introduced
[01:34:02.140 --> 01:34:05.900]   I think it was February 19th, but it was an older app. They gave it a complete makeover
[01:34:05.900 --> 01:34:10.540]   Um, it now has you know, iOS 8 style design and functionality
[01:34:10.540 --> 01:34:15.420]   Uh, and it just it's it's clean. It's it's really nice. There's a single in-app purchase
[01:34:15.420 --> 01:34:19.500]   To give you conversion features which used to be in a separate app called convert bot
[01:34:19.500 --> 01:34:25.340]   And uh tap bot as a company now has has done a re as on a makeover and they're only going to be focusing on a couple apps
[01:34:25.340 --> 01:34:30.860]   Going forward because they're a really small team there, you know, uh to iOS developers one Mac developer
[01:34:31.340 --> 01:34:34.940]   But they're doing great work. Tell me they're not giving up on uh tweet bot
[01:34:34.940 --> 01:34:39.020]   No tweet bot is getting a lot of their attention. They announced tweet bot for which is going to be
[01:34:39.020 --> 01:34:43.260]   Iphone iPad and or universal. I don't know if they've made that clear or not yet
[01:34:43.260 --> 01:34:49.180]   But it's gutsy of them because twitter just really doesn't like the ecosystem the third party ecosystem
[01:34:49.180 --> 01:34:54.540]   It's so confusing now. It's hard to tell they were staunchly forward at the beginning then they were staunchly against it
[01:34:54.540 --> 01:35:00.220]   It was sort of like when you send your significant other to college and then they leave you for a hotter looking
[01:35:01.100 --> 01:35:04.380]   When they graduate, has that happened to you? It sounds like a pain point there
[01:35:04.380 --> 01:35:09.660]   Well, no, but I mean that's essentially like the icon factory with twitterific and tweet bot and tweedy all help build up twitter
[01:35:09.660 --> 01:35:14.380]   And then they decided they wanted to appeal to celebrities in the mainstream and and basically did all they could to
[01:35:14.380 --> 01:35:18.140]   And monetize and monetize really yeah, absolutely
[01:35:18.140 --> 01:35:22.460]   Um, the second app I wanted to bring up was uh, there's a new version of vesper which is john
[01:35:22.460 --> 01:35:27.100]   Uh groover, david whiskus and brent simmons app and full disclosure
[01:35:27.100 --> 01:35:33.660]   They're all friends of mine, but they make a note taking thought collection app for the iphone and it just went universal as well
[01:35:33.660 --> 01:35:39.100]   So now it's iphone and ipad which means you can also sync now between iphone and ipad
[01:35:39.100 --> 01:35:44.140]   And um, the nice thing about this well depending on your point of view is they they raised their price
[01:35:44.140 --> 01:35:48.300]   You they tried going down. They were initially five bucks. They went down to three bucks
[01:35:48.300 --> 01:35:53.180]   Now they've gone back up to nine bucks, but it's on sale for around i think seven or eight dollars right now
[01:35:53.660 --> 01:35:59.180]   And uh, the big advantage they've decided that they just can't build this app they can't sustain this app at low prices
[01:35:59.180 --> 01:36:05.260]   Brent famously took a job at omni, um because you know, he wasn't making enough off vesper to make it his full-time job
[01:36:05.260 --> 01:36:10.300]   And they would rather make a sustainable app or not make an app at all and I have no problem spending
[01:36:10.300 --> 01:36:16.220]   Uh, you know five ten dollars, you know for an omni group is a great example of developers that price their apps
[01:36:16.220 --> 01:36:22.780]   For sustainability for an app that I use every day all day, you know from weeks and months and years on end
[01:36:23.420 --> 01:36:30.620]   And they're they're big hope out of this. I saw an interview with john groover on jason snell's six colors site where he was hoping other developers
[01:36:30.620 --> 01:36:34.060]   Um can start doing more of this and there've been a few who've done it
[01:36:34.060 --> 01:36:39.020]   And so far all the feedback i've seen is that they sell less copies, but they make more money
[01:36:39.020 --> 01:36:42.220]   And they're overhead for everything else is lower when they do this
[01:36:42.220 --> 01:36:45.500]   And it's going to come to a point where we have to pay not just for the apps
[01:36:45.500 --> 01:36:49.980]   We have but for the apps that we want and for the developers that we enjoy to keep making these apps
[01:36:50.460 --> 01:36:53.260]   Because there there really are you know, not a lot of alternatives
[01:36:53.260 --> 01:36:55.660]   Um, I mean there are there are a lot of free alternatives
[01:36:55.660 --> 01:36:59.340]   But if you if you want apps from these kinds of people you've got to pay for those apps
[01:36:59.340 --> 01:37:05.420]   So i'm hoping that like like the like uh cube ranch there are going to be other developers who say this is what it costs to make this app
[01:37:05.420 --> 01:37:08.700]   This is what we're charging and like everyone joined in the race to the bottom
[01:37:08.700 --> 01:37:13.020]   We hope you join the race to sustainability. I agree with you and eight bucks is nothing
[01:37:13.020 --> 01:37:16.780]   Yeah
[01:37:17.500 --> 01:37:20.460]   I just I just concur like I was just thinking about overcast
[01:37:20.460 --> 01:37:25.900]   Where I mean my one of my one of my many comments about it positive was that i'm glad that
[01:37:25.900 --> 01:37:32.380]   Marco is actually charging real money for this as opposed to 99 as opposed to get the whole thing for 99 cents
[01:37:32.380 --> 01:37:39.260]   Uh because I I feel very very positive when I feel like i'm helping this person continue to do something
[01:37:39.260 --> 01:37:43.420]   They love doing which is to continue to make this app. I don't want them to feel as though
[01:37:43.420 --> 01:37:48.300]   Well, that was two years of my life and I made a whole pile of six thousand dollars from it
[01:37:48.300 --> 01:37:51.260]   Which is good enough for me to cover the moving expenses for the job
[01:37:51.260 --> 01:37:55.340]   I'm going to have to take and the other on the other coast because I can't make a living off of app development
[01:37:55.340 --> 01:37:58.220]   And selfishly I want apps to cost a little bit more
[01:37:58.220 --> 01:38:02.220]   I'm not not a lot more but but a reasonable amount of money because I want to know they're going to be around
[01:38:02.220 --> 01:38:04.380]   You know like I want to know that that's a good business
[01:38:04.380 --> 01:38:08.300]   And they've got money to develop and they've got they can maybe hire other programmers to make it even better
[01:38:08.300 --> 01:38:12.060]   When it's free and I don't understand how they're going to make money with it or 99 cents
[01:38:12.060 --> 01:38:16.220]   And I'm not sure, you know, it actually worries me that the app isn't going to be successful long term
[01:38:16.220 --> 01:38:18.860]   And I'm going to get myself I'm going to get a whole bunch of data into it and
[01:38:18.860 --> 01:38:22.700]   Then it's going to be gone or never updated, you know, like uh
[01:38:22.700 --> 01:38:27.420]   What was it the one that we we miss all we still miss it's not it's not glimpse at some
[01:38:27.420 --> 01:38:30.060]   Uh, I'm not mind
[01:38:30.060 --> 01:38:31.580]   Well, uh, yeah, it's so many
[01:38:31.580 --> 01:38:34.380]   You forget
[01:38:34.380 --> 01:38:36.220]   See it's it's gone. It's already gone
[01:38:36.220 --> 01:38:39.660]   And so but it's but it was free and of course we were very excited about it
[01:38:39.660 --> 01:38:43.260]   We used it every day to became part of our our system and then and then it just one day
[01:38:43.260 --> 01:38:48.220]   They just like, you know turn off the switch. Yeah, well they get sold in the company that buys them turns them off or is
[01:38:48.220 --> 01:38:50.060]   Right
[01:38:50.060 --> 01:38:52.060]   Andy and ico your pick of the week
[01:38:52.060 --> 01:38:55.420]   Uh two two picks hopefully two quick ones
[01:38:55.420 --> 01:39:00.620]   Uh, this happened to arrive today is at long last the bandwagon on blu ray just cut loose today
[01:39:00.620 --> 01:39:06.860]   I pre-ordered this in december as soon as I found out that it was available because it is not just as
[01:39:07.260 --> 01:39:13.180]   Definitively my favorite musical ever and it might be it's definitely one of my top 10 or 15 movies ever
[01:39:13.180 --> 01:39:16.460]   And I've said and I got my mail like 10 15
[01:39:16.460 --> 01:39:22.460]   I thought do I have enough time to rip this before the show because I can't use the cpu for something other than streaming video
[01:39:22.460 --> 01:39:28.300]   And it finished about 10 minutes before and I spent 10 minutes watching the mp4 file and single stepping through the dance
[01:39:28.300 --> 01:39:32.060]   Oh good happens. It's such a beautiful beautiful book book by george s koffman
[01:39:32.060 --> 01:39:34.700]   Which makes it a great musical
[01:39:34.700 --> 01:39:37.180]   um
[01:39:37.180 --> 01:39:42.780]   Actually, it's uh, maybe i'm wrong. No, no, it's a beddie kompton and uh, it off green. So that's a classic
[01:39:42.780 --> 01:39:45.100]   Oh, okay, if i've been sent to manna manna manna
[01:39:45.100 --> 01:39:47.100]   Manelli arthur free production
[01:39:47.100 --> 01:39:54.220]   Uh, and I don't think that there's ever been a better movie made. It's just just exceptional and oscar lefant is so funny
[01:39:54.220 --> 01:39:57.580]   And I just love him in that exactly neurotic pill popping
[01:39:57.580 --> 01:39:58.540]   Yeah
[01:39:58.540 --> 01:40:01.660]   Sad sack and this is the one with god of shine on my shoes
[01:40:02.380 --> 01:40:08.220]   Yeah, exactly and I saw my heart. Yeah, and I I don't want to replay the entire movie for everybody but i'm agreeing
[01:40:08.220 --> 01:40:12.380]   I love this love it so much. Yeah. Oh and the girl hunt ballet who could forget that
[01:40:12.380 --> 01:40:17.100]   See I could shereeze I keep watching that and trying to make logical sense of it
[01:40:17.100 --> 01:40:20.380]   I think it's like bird man where you're not supposed to
[01:40:20.380 --> 01:40:24.140]   Not supposed to try to work out what just enjoy it sit back and enjoy it
[01:40:24.140 --> 01:40:31.420]   But the the the dance between friday staran sinteries in central park it's amazing both not just as in a beautiful dance
[01:40:31.500 --> 01:40:36.140]   But it's also the what it represents and the role that it plays in the story
[01:40:36.140 --> 01:40:39.180]   I don't think there has ever been a single better
[01:40:39.180 --> 01:40:44.940]   musical a dance number in any movie ever. It's is that dancing in the dark is that the one exactly? Yeah
[01:40:44.940 --> 01:40:50.700]   I again I was single stepping through it and even when you're playing it at like one 20th speed
[01:40:50.700 --> 01:40:54.780]   It's still gorgeous and you still have no idea how these two people
[01:40:54.780 --> 01:40:59.420]   Managed to do something that beautiful so it's a good. It's a good blue blue right to get
[01:40:59.980 --> 01:41:03.100]   It's it's good. I wish that it were like remastered blue ray
[01:41:03.100 --> 01:41:06.460]   We went to the original camera inter negative and they struck a brand new print
[01:41:06.460 --> 01:41:08.940]   I think but it's it's better than it was before that
[01:41:08.940 --> 01:41:11.820]   I think this was the first time I've seen the bandwagon where I recognize it
[01:41:11.820 --> 01:41:17.820]   Oh, so friday staris supposed to have like reddish hair. I did not know or excuse me. He's wearing reddish hair red way. Look at that
[01:41:17.820 --> 01:41:19.660]   exactly
[01:41:19.660 --> 01:41:24.060]   Well, it really is the bird man of uh 1953 so I think you should
[01:41:24.060 --> 01:41:29.740]   Because it kind of has some similarities and also shot in one contiguous shot. Yes
[01:41:29.740 --> 01:41:32.220]   One take that was it's amazing how they did that
[01:41:32.220 --> 01:41:37.660]   Vissanti menali said do we do want to do one more for safety and then they also look we've been dancing for two and a half hours now
[01:41:37.660 --> 01:41:40.220]   What you got is good enough
[01:41:40.220 --> 01:41:46.780]   There's this such thing as overthinking this for some incentive. Um, but my my iOS pick is this really cool
[01:41:46.780 --> 01:41:47.820]   uh
[01:41:47.820 --> 01:41:50.940]   app alphabet app for toddler is called the metamorphobet
[01:41:50.940 --> 01:41:53.420]   uh, and it is just a
[01:41:53.420 --> 01:41:55.660]   multi-touch like alphabet book
[01:41:55.660 --> 01:41:59.420]   In which they go from letter to letter and you touch and interact with it
[01:41:59.420 --> 01:42:04.940]   You have letter c and then it turns into something related to the letter c you have to see it in three dimensions
[01:42:04.940 --> 01:42:09.420]   and now cone and it says cone oh
[01:42:09.420 --> 01:42:13.980]   And it turns into
[01:42:13.980 --> 01:42:19.980]   Toddlers are going to suddenly think that the ipad is real life. Yeah, it's it's it's like a busy box
[01:42:19.980 --> 01:42:22.380]   And it keeps morphing into other things
[01:42:22.620 --> 01:42:24.620]   and
[01:42:24.620 --> 01:42:28.140]   Now cone becomes a car
[01:42:28.140 --> 01:42:34.540]   And the caterpillar is driving the car
[01:42:34.540 --> 01:42:37.820]   You know
[01:42:37.820 --> 01:42:44.700]   And you can play with the car, but it's it's like it's it's supposed to appeal to like people kids who are like pre-verbal and they're just tactile
[01:42:44.700 --> 01:42:49.340]   But it's like oh look the cat goes driving the car. I wonder what he becomes next
[01:42:51.260 --> 01:42:54.460]   Anyway, my question is how many people stare at you when you're at the train station
[01:42:54.460 --> 01:42:58.300]   Like
[01:42:58.300 --> 01:43:00.300]   And the kid wants a copy of it and
[01:43:00.300 --> 01:43:04.700]   And here's when they when they do laugh at you just look at them and just go see
[01:43:04.700 --> 01:43:12.060]   Yes, it's you almost want to keep a copy so that if you get stuck behind like a crying like kid like on an airplane
[01:43:12.060 --> 01:43:17.980]   Let them borrow your ipad and let this and at least the noises will be make or at least or at least oh as approved
[01:43:17.980 --> 01:43:20.140]   door
[01:43:20.140 --> 01:43:23.900]   Done. Oh look you can make the sun bounce up and down
[01:43:23.900 --> 01:43:27.660]   Oh, what's this now?
[01:43:27.660 --> 01:43:30.540]   Oh look
[01:43:30.540 --> 01:43:34.060]   Anyway, yes, that's see we're all kind of mesmerized by this
[01:43:34.060 --> 01:43:37.020]   It really does it really does plug into our like
[01:43:37.020 --> 01:43:45.420]   Ooh a daydreams, you know, you know, I bet you this is also really popular at colleges where there's a lot of acid and being fast around
[01:43:45.420 --> 01:43:47.820]   Around 4.20 pm am I right?
[01:43:48.540 --> 01:43:50.540]   Yeah, they're like, oh, dude
[01:43:50.540 --> 01:43:57.660]   Wow, that is deep and just 14 hunk force of uh of uh tablet apps for those of you who haven't seen the bandwagon
[01:43:57.660 --> 01:44:04.300]   I just have a little clip of that famous fredestaire sid Shreese moment where they're dancing in central park and it's just
[01:44:04.300 --> 01:44:07.340]   It's so it's so beautiful. It's
[01:44:07.340 --> 01:44:09.820]   See it's the precision of
[01:44:09.820 --> 01:44:11.980]   Every new one is considered
[01:44:11.980 --> 01:44:16.860]   That's actually a gilder radner and steve martin from i think like the 80s
[01:44:17.660 --> 01:44:22.700]   Uh and uh, hey, this just came in from nine to five mac a leak of apples
[01:44:22.700 --> 01:44:26.140]   Uh apple watch retail pitch
[01:44:26.140 --> 01:44:28.780]   Would you do you we got a minute?
