[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:28.040]   This is MacBrake Weekly, episode 29th for the week of February 12, 2007,
[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.720]   the new born identity.
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.320]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:42.560]   Hey, everybody.
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:43.840]   This is Alex Lindsay.
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.200]   And I'm stepping in.
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.360]   Leo is out.
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.920]   We've got the usual suspects, John Foster.
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.200]   Good evening, everyone.
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.840]   Or good morning, wherever you happen to be GMT-wise.
[00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:55.760]   Scott Borne.
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.720]   Hey, I'm in San Francisco this time.
[00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.280]   So don't be gig harboring me.
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.760]   Gig gig gig gig gig gig gig and Merlin Mann.
[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:02.800]   I'm next to Scott Borne.
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.920]   So don't be San Franciscoing me.
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.400]   So this is the first time I think Scott's
[00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.160]   been in the studio with us here.
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.720]   Oh, no, we've--
[00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:12.440]   No, second.
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:13.160]   Second time we did one.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.560]   We did that one around the table and talked about Genesis.
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.160]   It was beautiful.
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.480]   We haven't talked about Genesis in weeks.
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:19.680]   They're on the road with Genesis.
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.240]   They're on tour now.
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.520]   Genesis is a rock band.
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.880]   Yeah.
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.000]   But they're on tour minus Peter--
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.440]   Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.920]   I know this has nothing to do with a Mac.
[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:26.920]   First rattle of the evening.
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.920]   Never did it.
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.320]   The police are going on tour.
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.840]   That has something to do with a Mac.
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.200]   You know why it has something to do with a Mac?
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.440]   Sting uses a Mac.
[00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.000]   Yeah.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.640]   I actually know that because of friend of mine
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.880]   does IT for Sting.
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.120]   Do you realize how awesome they look for their age?
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.920]   Like, you know--
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:42.400]   That's what money does.
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.040]   Andy Summers is not a young man.
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.000]   He was in the animals.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.880]   He was 42 when the police were around.
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:47.920]   Andy Summers is in his early--
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.400]   Police broke up in '84.
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:49.880]   Right now.
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.840]   So Andy Summers got in mid '60s now.
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.320]   Can I just say after the Grammy thing?
[00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.320]   I mean, the performance was OK.
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.840]   It was fine.
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.880]   But I mean, more than anything, Stuart Copeland
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.080]   is still so hardcore.
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.580]   Yeah.
[00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:59.760]   I'm just here to say.
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.000]   He was hardcore when he was in--
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.480]   He's incredible.
[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.400]   He was hardcore when he was in Oysterhead.
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.600]   It was one of the best performances
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.360]   I've ever seen a drummer do.
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.320]   He's amazing.
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.760]   It's Stuart Copeland and Neil Pert.
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.960]   I'm sorry, I'm still kind of an old--
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:13.720]   We're going deep cat music.
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.520]   --log on the Mac music show here, folks.
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.200]   That's awesome.
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.240]   Let's come back to a whole music episode.
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.880]   One long, pointless, non-Mac music around.
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:21.880]   Well, no.
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.480]   As long as the musicians use a Mac,
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.560]   then we can talk about that.
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.060]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.640]   We should have Mac using the musicians that
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:28.640]   aren't actually on the show.
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.640]   But we're going to talk about them anyway.
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.720]   This weekend lame.
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.080]   For those of you at home, lame is
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.560]   a MP3 encoder that doesn't violate the--
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.240]   And now we've ruined the entire day.
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.920]   Boswell to Mike Johnson.
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.240]   So speaking of musicians and music,
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.600]   there's been a lot of different reactions.
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.440]   We didn't talk about it on this show,
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.040]   but we talked about some of the other shows related to Steve's
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.800]   letter to the industry.
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.160]   Basically laying out--
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.280]   Steve, I don't think we need to go into this in too much detail,
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.920]   but he basically said, there are three options.
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.560]   We can stay the course.
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.600]   Stay the course.
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.440]   We can license fair play.
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.360]   But that won't work.
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.440]   But that won't work.
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.720]   And or we can just make everything DRM-free.
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.240]   I want to know one thing.
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.600]   As he gave this speech--
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:14.400]   You give a speech.
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.200]   You just put it up there.
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.640]   What type did you--
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.000]   Was he on an aircraft carrier and did he have the words
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.040]   mission accomplished behind him?
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.840]   No.
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:22.760]   Just checking.
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.680]   No, because if he would have done that,
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.920]   he would have said, well, we're going to try this again.
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.560]   We're going to try this again.
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.600]   Anyway, he would have landed a custom van dressed in Elvis,
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.840]   maybe.
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.680]   So he laid it out there.
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.760]   And everybody said, you first.
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.400]   Well, I think that the situation is,
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.320]   I think he's also saying it has to be all or nothing.
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.240]   So of course, this is a good chess play.
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.960]   I mean, the thing is that Apple's basically telling
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:51.040]   the four big companies that you have to release everything
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.160]   for free, or we're not going to do anything, which gives them
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.880]   a fair bit of time because immediately Warner Brothers,
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.960]   the CEO of Warner Brothers or whatever, came up and said,
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.160]   well, he's crazy.
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.680]   DRM is the way to go.
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.040]   Microsoft released another DRM option.
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:09.280]   This also, though, allows him to keep on pushing, of course,
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.160]   at pushing towards--
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.960]   in Europe, pushing-- well, you shouldn't
[00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:14.760]   be paying attention to us.
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.440]   You should be paying attention to the record companies.
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.600]   Talk to them.
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:17.920]   Don't talk to us.
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.000]   Is it going to work?
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.320]   I think it actually has a chance of working only
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.840]   because I think it's going to work in another way, Alex.
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.040]   We haven't talked about the negotiation strategy here
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.960]   that Apple might be employing.
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.920]   Because keep in mind, there's a lot of pressure on Apple
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.160]   to charge more for the songs in the next round.
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.600]   A lot of these licenses are up for me negotiation.
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.040]   This could be simply a ploy saying,
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.280]   hey, we might just go a whole new direction, which
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.360]   gets the music companies to backpedal and say,
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.920]   hey, we'll just stick with what we got going on.
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.040]   99 cents is great.
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.480]   Let's just sign another five-year deal.
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.040]   They might figure that's all they can get.
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.600]   Do you think he really wants it to be DRM-free?
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:54.520]   I don't think he cares.
[00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.400]   I just think he wants a business model where he's in control.
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.560]   And he gets to set the rules.
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.040]   And he's worried that the record companies are going to--
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.800]   they're going to start to exert their influence
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.360]   and feel their oats.
[00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.320]   I mean, they made these deals quite some time ago.
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.800]   And nobody really knew what was going to happen.
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.000]   Now everybody's saying, hey, I like my apple pie.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.280]   But oh, that's another apple pie I could have a piece of.
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.040]   And I think that that's actually got more to do with it
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.120]   than the European thing.
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.640]   I do think it helps satisfy, like you said,
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:29.120]   I think it helps satisfy the interest in the European movement
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.480]   against Apple's proprietary system.
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.720]   And I do think it creates a new scapegoat,
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.520]   as you suggested, that being the record company.
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.240]   But I think that's actually got less to do with it
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.400]   than the money negotiations that they're involved in.
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.640]   That's my personal opinion.
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.280]   I think it definitely puts them on backpedaling.
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.600]   It leaves the record companies backpedaling.
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.800]   They're now hunkering down.
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.240]   They're no longer--
[00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.480]   we saw them pop up their feathers a lot
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:56.360]   and talk about how they're going to expect more from Apple
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.120]   in the next round.
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.800]   And now they're mostly just trying to defend DRM.
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.200]   What do you think, Merlin?
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.640]   Well, I said this on Twitter the other day.
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.280]   But I think that I think it's a classic piece of Steve
[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.720]   in the sense that he's done two things here.
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.520]   One thing is he's regained control of the conversation.
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:12.760]   And he's so good.
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.480]   I mean, he-- when I say he, it's a metonymy, I guess,
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.400]   for Apple in some way, or whatever, actually wrote that
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:16.920]   and put it up.
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:17.760]   And it might have been Steve.
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:18.240]   I don't know.
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.160]   It's not the point.
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.760]   The point is that they've regained control
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.880]   of this conversation in the public forum.
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.320]   And it basically thrown down.
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.880]   It's a hilarious kind of offensive move
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.160]   that they're so good at, which is everybody's over here
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.200]   having this conversation.
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.760]   And he suddenly throws it out on the gauntlet
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.280]   and then steps away and lets everybody fight it out.
[00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.280]   And however he comes up, he'll probably
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.480]   be smelling like a rose.
[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.440]   You know?
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.480]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:44.720]   I don't know about the negotiating stuff.
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.760]   Here's the question I have for all of you.
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.800]   Is that Steve's talking about no DRM.
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.080]   He's got the record companies going--
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:52.720]   backing up.
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.080]   He just wants to deal.
[00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.960]   EMI's talking about releasing a large portion
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.800]   of their catalog of DRM-free.
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.000]   The record companies, I think, understand--
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.080]   some of them understand that DRM is kind of a dead end for them.
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.040]   It's a mess.
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.120]   This is a big mess that they're not
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:09.880]   going to be able to get out of.
[00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.640]   But the other thing that's interesting
[00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.200]   is this whole beetle agreement mixed in
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.400]   with all of this whole conversation, which
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:19.880]   is that Apple no longer needs to go through--
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:23.560]   with Apple, the problem they had is they couldn't sell the music.
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:25.440]   They could sell-- they could be sellers of the music.
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:26.680]   And that was what was up there.
[00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.400]   But they couldn't be the label themselves.
[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:32.200]   The question is, is that with all this talk going,
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:35.120]   and with Apple lining up with the--
[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.400]   lining the beetles up and getting that all out of the way
[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:40.640]   forever, could Apple start direct publishing
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:42.200]   for artists themselves?
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:45.360]   Of course, look at the popularity of the iPod shuffle.
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.880]   So imagine you'd be being able to go in to a store,
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:52.160]   pay $79 and get a shuffle that's preloaded
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.640]   with a band's new album.
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:56.720]   For example, the Red Hot Chili Peppers,
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:59.600]   or the new U2 album, or the new Sticks album.
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.760]   And this isn't that far off when you look at the Baronega
[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:02.080]   ladies.
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:06.320]   The Baronega ladies are selling Del Salue a stick.
[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:09.000]   And this is Scott's favorite band, I think.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.800]   So they'll sell you a US drum stick, a thumb drive,
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.720]   with all of their-- whatever that album is.
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:15.440]   And people are paying it.
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:16.560]   They're happily paying it.
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.200]   But that doesn't play.
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:19.680]   You can't stick headphones into that.
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:20.600]   You're a USB player.
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:21.400]   You've got--
[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:22.400]   This is the next thing.
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:26.040]   And I think this is with the idea of different colors
[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:28.320]   and the idea that you could actually badge those things
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.520]   as your favorite band.
[00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:31.800]   Here's an idea.
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:35.120]   You're one of Merlin's favorite bands, like Sticks,
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:36.080]   for instance.
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:39.480]   And you decide that--
[00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:41.520]   Especially in the middle period sticks.
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:42.440]   Yeah.
[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.120]   Before they totally let Dennis take over.
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:46.320]   You decide that you really don't like your record
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:48.480]   company more and your deal's up.
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:51.800]   And you call up jobs and you go, hey, I got an idea.
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:55.520]   And then the kids in the band next door
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:58.280]   that are about to start a new record contract with the same
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:00.600]   label go, now wait a minute, Sticks left them.
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:01.680]   Maybe I don't need them.
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:04.520]   And all of a sudden, you get new and old artists gravitating
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:05.240]   towards Apple.
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.120]   I mean, look what they did to retail.
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:09.360]   I mean, I'm old enough to remember why that's the bigger
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:09.880]   question.
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:14.200]   When you went into a computer store in the early '90s--
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.560]   And paid a lot.
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:18.520]   You bought a wrap on somebody other than Apple.
[00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:20.560]   They didn't compete with their dealers.
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.680]   Then they just kind of ran their dealers out of business.
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:23.960]   This is actually a fascinating topic.
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:25.280]   I'll just give a little--
[00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:26.920]   well, I shouldn't give too much of a peek.
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:28.920]   But I didn't interview with a friend of mine the other day
[00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:32.840]   who's a pretty successful indie rock performer.
[00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:36.760]   And he was saying that the next record that he puts out,
[00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:39.800]   they're not putting any money into print publishing,
[00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:41.240]   into print ads at all.
[00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:44.400]   Which if you think about it, it's a pretty big step
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:45.560]   for somebody to take.
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:47.600]   Because what he's saying, he's saying all of this stuff
[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:48.600]   is a John Bader slice.
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:51.440]   So he's saying all of this stuff that people are spending
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:52.240]   all of this money on.
[00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:54.920]   You spend $2,000 to get a little ad in magnet.
[00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:58.840]   You do all this graft to get yourself on the end cap at
[00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:00.360]   Tower or wherever or Virgin.
[00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:00.960]   Tower doesn't exist.
[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:01.560]   I understand that.
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:06.960]   But the point of it is, so what is a label grade for?
[00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:08.960]   What a label is grade for is taking somebody like Michael
[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:12.760]   Jackson or Brittany Spears or somebody and pushing them
[00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:14.800]   through the machine in a really big way.
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.600]   To say, I'm going to throw such a huge amount of money
[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:18.120]   at this because I want to hit the very
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.640]   fattest end of the curve.
[00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:21.800]   But the question like you're describing for the stickses
[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:24.240]   or whoever of the world, I think that's a really
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:25.080]   interesting question.
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:27.480]   What do you do when a label doesn't want you?
[00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:30.160]   And you don't want to have to get into the plastic disk
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:30.520]   business.
[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:32.120]   Look at Jonathan Colton.
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:33.280]   Look at Jonathan Colton.
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:36.160]   Here's a guy who recently on his blog
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:39.400]   compared himself with a band that had been signed.
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:42.040]   And the band that had been signed were actually touring.
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:44.120]   They were making like $1,500 a month.
[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:45.040]   There's Dresden dolls.
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:45.400]   Yeah.
[00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:46.200]   And he was like--
[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.960]   Who are like a pretty well-known indie band?
[00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:51.080]   They're pretty well-known and signed.
[00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:52.080]   And signed.
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:53.480]   But I mean, they had like a record deal.
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:54.480]   They had a record deal.
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:55.480]   They're a professional band.
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:56.280]   They're a professional band.
[00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:58.040]   And he's like, I make way more money than that.
[00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:59.760]   They make $1,500 a month.
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.800]   And they're a tiny amount of money.
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:06.200]   My examples from Pittsburgh, the affordable floors.
[00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.480]   They were signed by Universal in the early '90s.
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:12.200]   Had a great album, a great single called Wedding Ring.
[00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:15.760]   And they're really, really great guys.
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:18.000]   And Universal went through a shift.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.600]   They went through this restructuring.
[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:22.920]   And the album got locked up.
[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:23.680]   And basically--
[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.280]   They're still under contract at that time.
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:26.480]   They can't do anything.
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:28.240]   They can't take the music that they recorded
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:29.080]   and take it anywhere else.
[00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:30.120]   They're not going to release it.
[00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:31.360]   They're not going to promote it.
[00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:33.360]   And that's the real risk is 80% of the bands that
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:34.200]   go into the machine.
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:35.040]   I mean, I had this--
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:37.360]   I was talking to somebody about this last week.
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:39.040]   When I worked for Sony Music, I knew
[00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:40.160]   that 80% of the people who were--
[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:42.520]   I wasn't A&R. I was promotion.
[00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:44.160]   But I was afraid of sending people to--
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.240]   I mean, you wanted to do it because it was Sony Music.
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:48.640]   It was one of the big four.
[00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:50.280]   And it could be there to tick it out.
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:52.840]   But the problem is that 80% of the bands that signed,
[00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:56.080]   this was the end of their career as a musician.
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:57.840]   They were literally going to lock them--
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:59.920]   going to be locked into Never Never Land.
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:01.840]   Never be able to do anything with their content
[00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:03.240]   and never get anything out of it.
[00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:04.240]   They'd be in Hawk.
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:05.960]   I mean, this was something we talked about on Twim
[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:09.480]   a little bit was this Courtney Love's long thing that
[00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:10.640]   came out in 2000.
[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:11.840]   I guess we didn't talk about that.
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:12.840]   It was on the bill.
[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:13.320]   It was on the bill.
[00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:16.160]   2000 left this-- did the math for people
[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:18.600]   of how indie band get started.
[00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:22.840]   And it was basically your--
[00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:25.720]   you sell your soul unless you get to millions
[00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:26.880]   and millions and millions of copies.
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:28.400]   Your bankrupts the whole time.
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:28.680]   Yeah.
[00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:30.160]   The conventional wisdom--
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:31.720]   we should probably wrap back around actual max stuff.
[00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:34.000]   But the conventional wisdom on a lot of this stuff--
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.040]   are you talking to anybody who does this for any length of time?
[00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:38.640]   Is the only serious, minding, dependable money?
[00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:42.640]   A lot of, let's say, authors, independent musicians,
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:43.880]   is on back catalog.
[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:46.440]   And having enough stuff out that it starts to build up.
[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:48.040]   Eventually you, they call it earning back.
[00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:50.440]   You earn back over time, whatever your advance or whatever
[00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:52.520]   it was, and all the production costs, all of which
[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:54.880]   the bands are paying themselves.
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:57.760]   But it isn't whatever record company comes along,
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:59.800]   waves of magic wand, and videos get made.
[00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:01.280]   That comes out of your pot.
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:04.280]   And I think a lot of people don't always know that.
[00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:06.080]   And there is still a value to management
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:08.240]   and some of what the record company brings,
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:10.560]   only because there's a lot of artists who buy themselves
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:11.520]   or knock on it.
[00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:12.680]   Artists don't want to be-- here's what it comes down to.
[00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:14.440]   Artists don't want to be merchants.
[00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:15.520]   But at the point--
[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:17.600]   So the people who are merchants on their behalf
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:19.720]   no longer have a lot to offer them.
[00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:20.880]   There's certainly a point where you've
[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:24.560]   got to look at whether you could do an analogous job
[00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:25.560]   on your own.
[00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:28.040]   Well, it's just like Mac users don't want to be IT professionals.
[00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:29.640]   They want their Mac to work.
[00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:31.160]   They don't want to have to configure the server.
[00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:33.760]   They don't want to have to mess with the back end.
[00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:35.520]   They just wanted--
[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:37.720]   And artists typically, what they want is they want someone
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:38.960]   to write them a check.
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:40.480]   Why don't you super quick last thing on this though?
[00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:42.000]   What do you make of the things Steve said
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   that I thought was kind of interesting?
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.640]   What do you make of him saying, OK, well then,
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:46.640]   why don't you put DRM on CDs?
[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:48.360]   Because the thrust of his point was--
[00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:49.400]   Well, they would have.
[00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:51.080]   They would have if it had existed back then.
[00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:52.280]   But I think his point is that you guys
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:54.040]   are all worried about people stealing your music.
[00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:56.040]   And yet every CD you put out is completely clear.
[00:13:56.040 --> 00:14:00.400]   OK, well, this is one of the failings of DRM on CDs.
[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:05.920]   It's back in 1993 when they came up with hybrid CDs.
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:07.840]   So you could have a data track.
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:09.040]   Is that Red Book now?
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:10.560]   Yeah, well, no, it's a data track.
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:14.320]   So like an ISO 9660 or a hybrid of that, which
[00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:17.480]   is a 9660 and a Mac track.
[00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:22.680]   So if you put that CD into some kind of CD players,
[00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:24.960]   older CD players, you'd play the data track
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:26.480]   and you would actually ruin speakers
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:28.560]   because it would go--
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:32.000]   and that whole noise would be damaging.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.920]   So they had a huge backlash of that.
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:39.000]   So that was the death of data track CDs.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.240]   And so if you add the idea that we're
[00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:44.840]   going to now have DRM CDs when everyone's like,
[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:46.040]   but I have a CD in my car.
[00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:47.680]   You try to play it in your car and it won't fit.
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:48.680]   It won't play.
[00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:49.520]   Yeah.
[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:51.960]   And so they've already told everybody,
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:53.920]   here's this great new format and we're
[00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:55.160]   going to put it in everything and we're
[00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:58.320]   going to have 250 million of them around the world
[00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:02.440]   or around California anyway.
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:04.440]   And suddenly, you can't play the music
[00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:05.840]   that you buy in the store.
[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:07.680]   They would have got the big finger from everybody.
[00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:09.520]   And this has been the bottom line of what
[00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:11.440]   Apple has made possible and what everyone else seems
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:12.200]   to have trouble with.
[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:16.240]   As soon as people go, I can't play the song.
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:18.800]   Whatever service they're using is worthless.
[00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:20.680]   I mean, I got started to get frustrated with iTunes
[00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:22.760]   when I had enough computers in the office that I had accidentally
[00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:25.840]   registered five computers and suddenly I can't play the song.
[00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:28.680]   And that is when I stopped buying every--
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:30.320]   I started-- when iTunes first came out,
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:31.920]   I was buying just buying songs.
[00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:32.360]   And then look at--
[00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:32.880]   No, this is fine.
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:33.400]   This is fine.
[00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:33.900]   This is fine.
[00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:36.280]   And suddenly, I hit the wall and went, OK,
[00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:37.920]   I'm going back to CDs.
[00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:39.600]   And then it just wasn't worth it.
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:41.480]   And then look at the Sony debacle from last year
[00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:45.880]   where they put the rootkit on the CD.
[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:47.360]   That was so crazy.
[00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:49.400]   Let's bring this all back to Max.
[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:52.360]   And where I think this might be relevant is this.
[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:56.200]   If Apple were-- and this is just fantasy on our part
[00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:58.880]   at the moment-- but if Apple were to get into the music
[00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:01.480]   publishing business directly and compete with the record
[00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:04.000]   companies because the record companies get to be somebody
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.400]   they don't want to deal with, the benefit to end users
[00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:10.200]   might end up being cheaper songs because if Apple doesn't
[00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:14.480]   have to pay-- the word is they pay the lion's share that $0.99
[00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:14.920]   to the--
[00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:15.440]   I don't think so.
[00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:16.920]   I think the songs stay the same.
[00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:18.440]   You think they wouldn't give them any kind of--
[00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:19.960]   Apple doesn't like it being confusing.
[00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:21.240]   They don't want you to think about it.
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:22.920]   So Apple's going to want it to be $99.
[00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:24.040]   Apple will just make more margin.
[00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:24.680]   $99.
[00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:25.200]   $99.
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:25.880]   It's not $99.
[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:26.360]   Yeah, it's actually--
[00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:27.440]   That'll be what the labels want.
[00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:29.600]   Well, yes.
[00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:31.680]   But what I think is interesting is
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:35.440]   Apple is really poised to really have a vertical market,
[00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:37.720]   which is the-- I mean, this is like
[00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:39.600]   Croups level vertical market, which
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:42.600]   is that I'm sitting there as an independent producer working
[00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:44.880]   in GarageBand that came with my iMac.
[00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:46.840]   And I'm just a little artist that I got it.
[00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:49.240]   And instead of saying Publish to iTunes--
[00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:50.840]   I mean, instead of saying Publish to--
[00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:52.680]   it says Publish to iTunes Music Store.
[00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:54.840]   Like literally, I can go straight from GarageBand
[00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:57.200]   or straight from Soundtrack or straight from Logic.
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:57.840]   And literally--
[00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:00.520]   It's associated with your email address and--
[00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:01.000]   Or whatever.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.520]   I set it up after register and account.
[00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:05.720]   And I can send that song and make it available, even send it
[00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:07.040]   out to the RSS or whatever.
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:09.360]   That becomes-- that is an incredible--
[00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:11.120]   iTunes marketplace.
[00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:11.720]   Exactly.
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:14.400]   If somebody figures out how to do that,
[00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:16.360]   that's the next eBay, the next YouTube.
[00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:17.560]   That's the next really big deal.
[00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:20.440]   I know that Apple hasn't done that yet,
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:23.760]   because the touch that's involved in doing that
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:25.960]   and keeping track of millions of micro payments--
[00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:27.160]   That's what Apple doesn't want to do.
[00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:29.600]   That's why they're happy for City Baby to do that.
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:30.960]   You manage the micro payments.
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:32.460]   Apple doesn't want to deal with anything
[00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:34.280]   where they're-- But if someone came up with a system that
[00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:36.040]   would allow you to tie all that stuff together
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:38.440]   and you-- and Apple became a publishing company,
[00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:40.800]   and then we created music and we set it out
[00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:43.080]   through GarageBand or whatever, that could be brilliant.
[00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:44.040]   That could be big.
[00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:45.720]   That could change the way everything works.
[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:49.440]   And that could take the power away from the RIAA
[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:51.440]   and their evil millions.
[00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:54.360]   Well, and I think that the thing that the RIAA still brings
[00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:55.920]   to it, and I think that the thing that we have to get--
[00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:56.960]   we have to figure out around.
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:58.240]   It's not just making the music.
[00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:01.680]   It's also how do I make sure people actually know that I made it.
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:03.440]   And that's the thing that's still--
[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:05.680]   That's what the label's supposed to come in.
[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:07.160]   And that's where they do come in.
[00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:10.160]   I'm not saying that there's not other ways around it,
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:12.360]   but they still come in and they still spend a lot of money
[00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:13.640]   and they still do a lot of things,
[00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:14.640]   and they pull a lot of strings.
[00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:16.960]   I used to be the person that pulled them for them.
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:18.920]   There was still a lot of things got on the radio
[00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:21.880]   because I knew a guy and I took them out to dinner
[00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:23.200]   once a month and there was--
[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:25.320]   Well, the short tail works.
[00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:26.360]   There was no pull.
[00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:27.640]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:29.240]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:30.440]   The short tail--
[00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:31.960]   The short tail does work.
[00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:34.720]   The problem is getting into the short tail is so tough.
[00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:36.680]   The long tail's easier.
[00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:39.120]   And the filtering and all that other thing--
[00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:40.160]   I mean, that's another issue.
[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:42.360]   But I think that this is a very interesting discussion,
[00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:45.480]   not only because being older than anyone else on the panel.
[00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:48.200]   I've seen this happen over and over in different versions
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:50.800]   through the years where one company has gotten started
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:53.880]   in a industry where they ended up branching
[00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:55.960]   into all the other parts of that industry
[00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:57.280]   and basically dominating it.
[00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:59.480]   And when I think that this wasn't possible until Apple
[00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:02.000]   solved its issues with the Beatles,
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.440]   I think that a lot of the stuff you could see the stuff moving,
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:07.280]   but it wasn't there like clean--
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:08.640]   it wasn't a clean shot until then.
[00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:11.400]   Can I talk about something else that just came out of my mind?
[00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:13.000]   Let us know, Scott.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.400]   Tell me about your mother.
[00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:18.360]   It's sort of-- well, I have to say iPhone related,
[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:19.200]   but--
[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:20.120]   Oh, man.
[00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:22.200]   It's relevant because--
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:24.440]   You may take a drink.
[00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:27.520]   Now, we went a long time in the show before I said iPhone.
[00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:29.680]   But this is sort of on topic because did you guys
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:33.680]   hear that Apple is in talks allegedly with electronic arts
[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:37.400]   to develop games for the iPhone?
[00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:40.160]   We have not heard any definitive word about games
[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:41.160]   to the iPhone.
[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:42.160]   Where did you hear this?
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:43.160]   From a reliable source.
[00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:44.160]   Jeez, here we go.
[00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:45.160]   And--
[00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:46.160]   Friend of a friend of a friend.
[00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:47.160]   No, come on.
[00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:50.240]   All of my iPhone predictions have generally been pretty spot on.
[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:52.080]   So I'll defend that and say--
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:53.080]   All of them?
[00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:54.080]   All of them.
[00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:55.080]   And then pretty spot on.
[00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:56.080]   I said pretty spot on.
[00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:57.240]   Yeah, I think it would be easier for you to say a lot of them
[00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:58.240]   and--
[00:19:58.240 --> 00:19:59.240]   OK, a lot of them have been pretty spot on.
[00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:00.920]   We could acknowledge the fact you're basically throwing darts
[00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:01.920]   in the dark.
[00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:04.400]   And eventually one of them is going to hit somebody in the ass.
[00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:07.760]   This has been reported by a major Wall Street analyst, my friend.
[00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:08.760]   Oh, it's an analyst.
[00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:09.760]   An analyst.
[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:10.760]   A Wall Street firm.
[00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:11.760]   A Wall Street firm.
[00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:12.760]   A Wall Street firm.
[00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:16.360]   And it infected Apple stock price the other day.
[00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:19.240]   So it's relatively reasonably true.
[00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:23.840]   And I just think that what could be interesting to maybe morph these conversations together
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:29.560]   is what if Apple allowed you to publish your own games to the iPhone using the same model
[00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:34.240]   where they had the iPhone marketplace and you could be a content creator that was offering
[00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:38.280]   your own games and your own ringtones and all kinds of stuff that can move on that same
[00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:39.280]   pipeline?
[00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:42.520]   I think Apple's definitely going to allow you to develop your own applications, your own
[00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:45.360]   games and your own music for the-- well, I don't know about the music, but your own
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:49.920]   games and applications for the iPhone, but you're going to have to go through them at
[00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:50.920]   every moment.
[00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:52.680]   I think that's the cost.
[00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:53.680]   I think that's the cost.
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:54.680]   Is it Apple will make that available?
[00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:55.680]   They want their cut.
[00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:56.680]   Well, I think they want their cut.
[00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:57.680]   They're all quality control.
[00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:01.640]   I think it's more quality control than their cut, in my opinion.
[00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:03.720]   The World Wide Developer Conference got announced.
[00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:04.720]   It did?
[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:05.720]   Yeah.
[00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:06.720]   June the 10th through the 14th.
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:07.720]   And we'll be there.
[00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:10.400]   And what do you think is going to happen at the World Wide Developer Conference?
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:11.400]   I know what's going to happen.
[00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:15.600]   I'm going to take a wild guess that, oops, I have to say it again, the iPhone is going
[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:16.600]   to be shipping.
[00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:17.600]   It's going to be storing them.
[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:21.440]   And if it's shipping, it'll be shipping when you buy us a phone.
[00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:23.440]   Oh, he's so--
[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:24.440]   You know what, Alex?
[00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:25.440]   Big words.
[00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:27.440]   Big words when it was Mac World for now.
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:30.880]   Don't even give him the attention.
[00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:32.840]   That's what he craves.
[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:34.240]   Don't even give him the attention.
[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:38.040]   All you guys made fun of me forever about the iPhone.
[00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:39.520]   And now you all want one.
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:40.520]   It's yours.
[00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:41.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:42.520]   Now it makes sense.
[00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:43.520]   I want my free one that I was promised.
[00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:45.600]   Just make sure you're not listening to it on New York Streets.
[00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:46.600]   That's--
[00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:47.600]   Yes.
[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:48.600]   Yes.
[00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:49.600]   Because you could get a ticket.
[00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:50.600]   A $100 fine.
[00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:51.600]   So--
[00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:52.600]   Well, it's proposed.
[00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:53.600]   It's not really.
[00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:54.600]   It's not really.
[00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:56.320]   I'd like to do some name calling too.
[00:21:56.320 --> 00:22:01.960]   The New York State Senator Carl Kruger is expected to introduce legislation that would
[00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:06.240]   impose a $100 fine for people who continue to use their electronic gadgets, such as
[00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:10.360]   iPods, Blackberries, and video games, while crossing the street.
[00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:12.360]   But did he specifically mention the iPhone?
[00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:15.680]   He didn't, but I have a feeling that there's anything with headphones in your--
[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:17.680]   Third way to sneak it in so--
[00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:18.680]   That's good.
[00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:19.680]   That's good.
[00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:20.680]   Let me take another drink.
[00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:24.920]   The idea of nanny laws-- and this is continuous throughout our government, where everyone goes,
[00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:26.080]   "There ought to be a law."
[00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:27.080]   Yeah.
[00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:29.440]   You know, "There ought to be a law against using iPhones on a car.
[00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:31.920]   There ought to be a law against using iPhones while crossing the street."
[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:34.200]   "There ought to be a law while using iPhones in an elevator."
[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:40.640]   "There ought to be a lot about using iPhones in the restroom, as we saw from that phone
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:41.640]   guy the other day."
[00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:42.640]   Yeah.
[00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:43.640]   Yeah.
[00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:46.640]   But this is like trying to stop suicides by outlying blood stains on sidewalks.
[00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:52.720]   It completely misses the-- first of all, it's very difficult to social engineer human behavior.
[00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:53.720]   Right.
[00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:56.720]   And this is just the most transparent kind of stupid-- oh my gosh, let's see, I'm a
[00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:59.520]   planet-- the most transparent kind of stupid jack-ass move.
[00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:01.760]   It's just-- I mean, this is-- it's forever headlines.
[00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:02.760]   It's ridiculous.
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:03.760]   I mean--
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:07.080]   If you watch people crossing the street in San Francisco, they don't look both ways
[00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:08.080]   before crossing the street.
[00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:09.080]   San Francisco is a little different.
[00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:12.840]   But the idea being is that they've been told that they are safe.
[00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:13.840]   We have to see-- in San Francisco--
[00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:18.440]   --every city has a different pact between pedestrian and driver.
[00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:23.760]   Every city, it differs-- and in San Francisco, I think the pact is that as long as we stay
[00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:27.160]   out of the crosswalk when the light is green, they need to be cool with not hitting us.
[00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:28.160]   Right.
[00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:29.640]   Whereas in New York, apparently, it's every man for himself.
[00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:31.640]   Well, in San Francisco, you don't even have to do it.
[00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:32.640]   I mean, you go out of a tenderloin.
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:37.680]   You can slam on people's cars and throw quarters to walk slowly during the green.
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:40.160]   You're now no longer a pedestrian that has any kind of rights.
[00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:43.440]   In San Francisco, you can just kind of walk slowly and stare at the cars and even yell
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:44.680]   at them while they're trying to get around.
[00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:45.680]   Actually, in San Francisco, we hiss.
[00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:46.680]   We're a big hiss in town.
[00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:47.680]   Yeah.
[00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:50.840]   I think the strategy is to move in a group.
[00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:52.240]   Oh, that is good.
[00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:54.920]   I'll tell you where the strategy to move in a group is.
[00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:56.760]   We're doing a little bit of a rattle.
[00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:57.760]   Rattle?
[00:23:57.760 --> 00:23:58.760]   You might take a drink.
[00:23:58.760 --> 00:23:59.760]   In Mumbai.
[00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:00.760]   Oh, yeah.
[00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:01.760]   Right.
[00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:03.640]   You always make sure that there are at least two people on each side of you and then you
[00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:05.040]   just wait for them.
[00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:06.040]   They know what they're doing.
[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:07.040]   You don't know what you're doing.
[00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:09.720]   You just wait for them to start running across the street because there are no stoplights
[00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:13.000]   and everyone just is going and then they just move in and they just move in as a group.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.560]   It's like little schools of fish.
[00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:16.560]   Wow.
[00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:21.000]   As soon as we all go, it's too many for the cars to hit and they'll stop.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.600]   Can we do rattle music?
[00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:23.600]   Rattle.
[00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:24.600]   We should have a little theme song.
[00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:25.600]   We need a rattle.
[00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:26.600]   I will do it.
[00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:27.600]   Anyway, I would like to challenge.
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:28.600]   I would like to challenge.
[00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:29.600]   But I guarantee.
[00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:32.600]   For a long period of time, I'm still going to be able to wear my headphones.
[00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:35.120]   I did not read the whole article.
[00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:38.120]   I've just seen the headline.
[00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:40.040]   I mean, so what?
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:41.960]   Some guy got killed in a crosswalk.
[00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:45.800]   One person got killed and so the thrust of this is now everybody has to...
[00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:49.440]   Just another example of your government working hard to make you work harder.
[00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:50.720]   Actually, you know what it is?
[00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:52.560]   It's the MacGyver effect.
[00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:53.920]   How's that?
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:55.720]   There was a show on called MacGyver.
[00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:56.720]   Oh, really?
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:57.720]   This guy.
[00:24:57.720 --> 00:24:58.720]   There was this guy.
[00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:01.080]   Because you're too young, Merlin, to actually remember MacGyver.
[00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:02.640]   You can make this out of toothpicks.
[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:04.240]   There's so much older than you think I have.
[00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:05.240]   Quit this.
[00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:06.240]   I didn't have anything to do with...
[00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:07.240]   I was talking in case I was listening.
[00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:09.120]   I remember a cuckler, Fran and Ollie.
[00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:10.720]   They would come out and it was a puppet show.
[00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:13.960]   Very enjoyable to watch and there'd always be a lesson and one of them was a dragon.
[00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:15.480]   It was a dragon and there was a lady.
[00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:16.480]   I don't remember what the other...
[00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:20.040]   I don't remember what the other puppet was but they were on the television.
[00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:22.080]   Sometimes they were on the radio but I didn't like it this much because I couldn't see
[00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:23.080]   the puppets.
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:26.640]   You know, I'm such a MacGyver guy that I carry solder in my wallet.
[00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:31.640]   I was trying to explain for our listeners that may not be familiar with MacGyver.
[00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:35.200]   MacGyver would every week get into some kind of a situation where he would get out of
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:37.360]   it by stuff that was available.
[00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:38.360]   Right.
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:42.920]   So, in the military, what would happen is some genius that runs like the stockade would
[00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:47.480]   watch an episode of MacGyver and watch MacGyver use a toothpick to do something.
[00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:52.160]   He would then run through the military prison and ban all toothpicks.
[00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:55.800]   Because clearly that could be used as a security threat and I have a friend that used to work
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:59.320]   at the military prison and he would say, "Well, the latest MacGyver thing is..."
[00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:03.480]   And then they would tell me something just asinine but because this guy saw it on MacGyver.
[00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:04.840]   So that's what's happening in New York.
[00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:10.040]   One guy gets killed wearing an iPod and we don't know by the way that the iPod had anything
[00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:11.800]   to do with it but he gets killed.
[00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:18.760]   So now they want to make a law and it's what I like to call the good intentions with bad
[00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:19.760]   interests.
[00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:20.760]   You know how I blame Scott?
[00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:22.120]   I'm going to join Pat and Oswald on this one, Hippies.
[00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:23.120]   I blame Hippies.
[00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:28.920]   That's Hippies and children of Hippies making laws, crazy frickin laws that make no sense.
[00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:34.440]   I think that the law should be, look both ways before crossing the street.
[00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:36.280]   I think the law should be, you're on your own.
[00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:37.280]   Whatever you need to get rid of.
[00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:38.280]   You're what I learned.
[00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:40.240]   I learned, I learned, I learned in probably the first grade and I still use it to this
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:41.800]   day every time I cross the street.
[00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:45.720]   You look to your left, you look to your right and you look to your left again.
[00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:46.720]   That's what you need to know.
[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:47.720]   That should be the law.
[00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:48.720]   You got to look three times and then you're good to go.
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:52.920]   I think we should send an email campaign in New York with those pieces of advice.
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:55.440]   Send your letters to Attorney General.
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:58.720]   I believe the woman was named Fran and she would talk to the dragon who might have been
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:26:59.720]   Kukla or Ali.
[00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:00.720]   I can't remember but they were puppets.
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:01.720]   I do remember that.
[00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:02.720]   Made the on television.
[00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:04.400]   It was a children show but I enjoyed it.
[00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:05.400]   Heck are you imitating?
[00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:06.400]   I don't know.
[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:07.400]   That's not my usual Scott voice.
[00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:08.400]   That's not my usual Scott voice.
[00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:09.400]   That's not me.
[00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:10.400]   I can do it.
[00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:11.400]   I have a Scott voice.
[00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:12.400]   That's fun.
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:13.400]   That's what it's called.
[00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:14.400]   That's the one Scott voice.
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:15.400]   I haven't heard the Scott voice.
[00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:17.400]   I've heard you do the Thurston Hall the third voice.
[00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:18.400]   Let's save it for another time.
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:19.400]   We're behind.
[00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:20.400]   I'm sure.
[00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:22.520]   We haven't really talked about much Mac news on this show.
[00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:26.080]   So Microsoft, we're going to want to talk about Mac stuff.
[00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:28.080]   Let's talk about Microsoft.
[00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:31.920]   Microsoft slugs Mac users with a Vista tax.
[00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:36.640]   So evidently, according to the licensing, even if you can install Vista on Bootcamp,
[00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:38.480]   is it Bootcamp or just parallels?
[00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:39.480]   Parallel.
[00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:40.480]   Just parallels.
[00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:42.480]   So basically, you have to get-
[00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:43.480]   It's the whole virtualization.
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:48.720]   Virtualization is only licensed in the higher end.
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:53.720]   So you really have to get the Enterprise edition to be licensed to use the virtualization.
[00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:54.720]   D-D-D-D-D-D.
[00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:59.400]   These are the voyages of a starship Vista.
[00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:04.020]   It's chronicles a five-year mission to get developed in a way that is not called short
[00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:05.020]   horn.
[00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:06.920]   You boldy decide which version I should buy.
[00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:07.920]   I don't know.
[00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:08.920]   Spock.
[00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:09.920]   Spock.
[00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:10.920]   Why does it-
[00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:11.920]   Spock.
[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:12.920]   Why does it-
[00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:18.520]   You know, that's the sound of about ten skip buttons being hit.
[00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:27.920]   There are now officially 1.397 million reasons not to run Windows on a Mac.
[00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:28.920]   Well-
[00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:30.920]   And that was 1.397 and 1.
[00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:31.920]   You run it-
[00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:32.920]   You run it on Bootcamp.
[00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:33.920]   That's the deal.
[00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:34.920]   So I haven't done this.
[00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:35.920]   Bootcamp is where it's on its own partition, right?
[00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:37.420]   Yeah, and that's still fine.
[00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:39.120]   parallelization thing.
[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:41.320]   This is the case of don't ask, don't tell.
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:42.320]   Right.
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:43.320]   You know, you can be-
[00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:44.320]   There's a lot of things.
[00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:45.320]   I think Matlock might disagree.
[00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:46.320]   There's a lot of sounds.
[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:48.320]   There's a lot of things that we do on our computers that we don't have.
[00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:50.720]   We don't tell anybody about.
[00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:53.000]   I don't want to hear any more details, John.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   Thank you.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   Scott, do you know anything on your computer that we-
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:58.080]   No, nothing.
[00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:00.000]   It's Christmas.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   Here's what I think about running Windows.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.360]   Here's what I think about running Windows.
[00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:07.200]   It's Valentine's Day.
[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:08.200]   Here's-
[00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:11.200]   What's he doing with that flashlight?
[00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:16.000]   I'm a joke that nobody knows.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   So stop.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   Okay.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.440]   Here's what I would like to make an analogy that will resonate, I believe.
[00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:26.440]   If you want to run Windows on a Mac, and gosh, I can't think of why you'd want to do that,
[00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:29.400]   then if we were to look at the corresponding-
[00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:31.000]   I'm a Mac, I'm a PC ad.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   You know what that would be like?
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.560]   I'll tell you what that would be like.
[00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:35.400]   The Mac guy would be standing there.
[00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:39.920]   The PC guy would be standing there, and a beautiful girl would be standing there to represent
[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:45.720]   this thing of running Windows on a Mac, and she would be a transvestite.
[00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:48.960]   We're going to get letters now.
[00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:52.000]   No, I might want to run XSI on my Mac.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   There's apps.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   There's a lot of reasons.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.720]   You know who needs the reason to do that is people who are on Windows right now.
[00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:00.440]   So a lot of the folks, I mean what I'm hearing from folks is they're-
[00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:01.440]   We've talked about this a lot of Mac.
[00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:02.440]   They want a Mac, and they can't have it.
[00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:05.720]   Well, I think what a lot of people are saying is that there's this for-
[00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:10.120]   It's been bubbling up for a long time that they've been kind of quietly thinking.
[00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:11.840]   You quietly think that they've been thinking-
[00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:12.840]   You can't.
[00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:13.840]   You know.
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:15.400]   I'll see you outside, buddy.
[00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:17.120]   You still get some industry standards.
[00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:21.040]   But you've got people who are saying, you know, "I'm ready to make the switch," but I
[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:24.480]   have these apps that I still need to be able to run, whether that's my favorite sound,
[00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:28.520]   you know, processing thing or outlook or whatever, or I can only log in.
[00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:31.680]   How many people do you know who are like, "Oh, I've got to have ABC software to log
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:32.680]   in this place?"
[00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:37.160]   But you know, these people- this is like eating Chef Boyardee and saying you went to an Italian
[00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:38.160]   restaurant.
[00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:39.160]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:40.160]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:41.160]   No, no, no.
[00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:42.160]   No, no, no, no.
[00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:43.160]   No, no, no, no.
[00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:44.160]   It's a fact I like it.
[00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:45.160]   It's a fact I like it.
[00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:46.160]   It's a fact I like it.
[00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:47.160]   It's a fact I like it.
[00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:48.160]   It's a fact I like it.
[00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:49.160]   It's a fact I like it.
[00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:50.160]   It's a fact I like it.
[00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:51.160]   It's a fact I like it.
[00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:52.160]   It's a fact I like it.
[00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:53.160]   It's a fact I like it.
[00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:54.160]   It's a fact I like it.
[00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:55.160]   It's a fact I like it.
[00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:56.160]   It's a fact I like it.
[00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:57.160]   It's a fact I like it.
[00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:58.160]   It's a fact I like it.
[00:30:58.160 --> 00:30:59.160]   It's a fact I like it.
[00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:00.160]   It's a fact I like it.
[00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:01.160]   It's a fact I like it.
[00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:02.160]   It's a fact I like it.
[00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:03.160]   It's a fact I like it.

[00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:09.160]   It's a fact I like it.
[00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:10.160]   It's a fact I like it.
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:11.160]   It's a fact I like it.

[00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:20.160]   It's a fact I like it.
[00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:21.160]   It's a fact I like it.

[00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:29.160]   It's a fact I like it.
[00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:30.160]   It's a fact I like it.
[00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:31.160]   It's a fact I like it.
[00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:32.160]   It's a fact I like it.
[00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:33.160]   It's a fact I like it.
[00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:34.160]   It's a fact I like it.
[00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:36.160]   I like it.
[00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:37.160]   I like it.
[00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:38.160]   It's a fact I like it.
[00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:39.160]   It's a fact I like it.
[00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:40.160]   It's a fact I like it.
[00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:41.160]   It's a fact I like it.
[00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:42.160]   It's a fact I like it.

[00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:48.160]   It's a fact I like it.
[00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:49.160]   It's a fact I like it.
[00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:50.160]   It's a fact I like it.
[00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:51.160]   It's a fact I like it.
[00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:52.160]   It's a fact I like it.

[00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:57.160]   It's a fact I like it.
[00:35:57.160 --> 00:36:04.160]   It's a fact I like it.
[00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:07.160]   It's a fact I like it.

[00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:09.160]   It's a fact I like it.
[00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:10.160]   It's a fact I like it.
[00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:11.160]   It's a fact I like it.

[00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:21.160]   It's a fact I like it.
[00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:22.160]   It's a fact I like it.
[00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:23.160]   It's a fact I like it.
[00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:24.160]   It's a fact I like it.
[00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:25.160]   It's a fact I like it.
[00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:26.160]   It's a fact I like it.
[00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:27.160]   Boom.
[00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:28.160]   Boom.
[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:29.160]   Boom.
[00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:30.160]   Boom.
[00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:32.160]   It's from believe it or not,
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:34.160]   VOS games and it's pretty cool.
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:35.160]   A couple of things.
[00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:39.160]   You can control it by using Apple remote.
[00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:40.160]   That pretty much useless.
[00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:41.160]   Wow.
[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:44.160]   That kind of useless remote control that you get.
[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:45.160]   I don't know.
[00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:49.160]   I've never used front row for anything other than just demonstrating it from 30 feet.
[00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:52.160]   It does make a cool demo for your friends.
[00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:53.160]   It does.
[00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:54.160]   Look.
[00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:55.160]   I can control my math.
[00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:56.160]   I can go back to work.
[00:36:56.160 --> 00:37:02.680]   Anyway, you can use the remote control to record, pause, rewind, increment the track.
[00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:07.040]   It keeps track of takes so it automatically increments that stuff.
[00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:08.440]   Up to 10 tracks?
[00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:10.080]   Up to 10 tracks at a time.
[00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:15.240]   In demo mode it works only with two tracks which is fine for doing the one on one recording.
[00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:17.280]   How much is it?
[00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:23.560]   It's not very much money for two tracks, 30 bucks and it's $260 if you want to fork over
[00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:25.560]   for all 10 tracks.
[00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:26.840]   Is there a link between?
[00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:28.120]   Is it like $30 per two?
[00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:31.920]   No, it's either pro or basic.
[00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:33.920]   It's either pro or basic.
[00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:37.880]   The cool thing about it is you get two discrete tracks.
[00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:42.160]   Unlike in Quicktime Pro where if you're doing recording you've got to make sure your mixer
[00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:45.040]   is fanned out over to the right and then fanned out.
[00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:46.880]   Hand left and right.
[00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:48.400]   You've got to remember to do that.
[00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:52.000]   Otherwise you get one track and it's worthless for doing that.
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.720]   You don't have to remember to do the pan left, right?
[00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:55.720]   You have to just treat tracks.
[00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:57.520]   It has a couple other things that are really cool.
[00:37:57.520 --> 00:38:01.640]   It has better meters than the Quicktime meters.
[00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:03.960]   You can do RMS hold.
[00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:07.760]   The meters are really, these look like the standard pro.
[00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:13.120]   They're the core audio meters but they're, they put nice little clickies in it.
[00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:15.840]   They put a little line so it makes it look much more accurate than it actually.
[00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:21.960]   I mean it's accurate but you know, well because if I record more lines on it.
[00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:26.040]   If I'm recording a garage band I basically get this one meter and it feels really slow
[00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:29.720]   to me and it's really small and it doesn't really give me the info that I want.
[00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:30.720]   And if I'm watching the wave.
[00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:31.720]   You don't have any history.
[00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:32.720]   Is the other thing.
[00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:33.720]   Yeah.
[00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:34.720]   If I'm watching.
[00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:37.040]   I like a meter that you can see like where if you've made changes you can.
[00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:43.600]   So if I'm watching the waveform history, if I'm doing pan left right, one of the things
[00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:46.960]   is going to, one of the channels is going to look correct and the other channel is not
[00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:50.200]   going to look correct because of the way that stupid thing draws.
[00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:51.920]   Anyway, it's annoying.
[00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:55.280]   Plus you can name all the channels in advance so you don't have to worry about when you
[00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:56.280]   go to.
[00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:57.920]   And where is this available John?
[00:38:57.920 --> 00:38:59.760]   It's available from.
[00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:01.000]   The US games.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:06.040]   The US games dot NL dot NL the 30 day demos.
[00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:08.920]   Also I can jam jam or continue a sink against time code.
[00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:09.920]   Yeah.
[00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:11.280]   Time code is less interesting to me.
[00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:12.280]   I like it.
[00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:14.440]   I know but it made me happy.
[00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:16.160]   Yeah.
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:17.160]   That's what I know.
[00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:18.160]   It looks cool.
[00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:19.680]   I'm actually going to try and download this and give it a.
[00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:23.480]   It's something that I, you know, it's basically lightweight and it's better than quick time
[00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:24.480]   pro.
[00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:27.440]   Although I'm actually interested because I have to admit I have there's no love loss
[00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:28.800]   here with two base.
[00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:30.960]   We like you base but I don't.
[00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:32.440]   But I said that to give you a hard time.
[00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:33.440]   It's a pain.
[00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:34.440]   It's a pain to install.
[00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:35.440]   It's a pain to set.
[00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:38.160]   It's a pain to use because we've lost stuff before.
[00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:39.320]   Well, we've lost.
[00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:42.360]   I've only lost of once and one I didn't realize what I was doing.
[00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:47.960]   Well, the the biggest thing is is that is that boom recorder does not use the space bar
[00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:50.960]   to stop.
[00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:54.000]   This was a problem for Alex one on a twin.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   We had weird.
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.360]   I hit the space bar and it stopped recording and I just hadn't realized it.
[00:39:57.360 --> 00:39:59.040]   That's a pretty wide convention.
[00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:00.040]   Yeah.
[00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:01.600]   We know why there's no computers allowed in this.
[00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:02.760]   Well, no, Alex still has.
[00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:03.760]   I still have my.
[00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:06.800]   No, this looks this looks really great because right now my big problem is is that we use
[00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:13.160]   Cubase LE because because soundtrack doesn't do multi track and so it's a great big bummer
[00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:15.160]   and maybe they'll fix that in the next.
[00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:21.240]   The the boom recorder though looks like it would be a great solution for grabbing that
[00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:22.240]   stuff.
[00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:24.760]   I have to admit I'm stuck with Cubase right now because I know it's solid and it'll do
[00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:27.320]   it every time if as long as I don't hit the space bar.
[00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:32.000]   Scott, my pick is not a piece of software.
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.640]   It is a piece of hardware sort of.
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:36.120]   It's actually a bean bag.
[00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:37.840]   So it's not particularly hard.
[00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:39.600]   It's a high-pod bean.
[00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:45.040]   It's actually called an omni pod and you can find it at http colon slash slash omni
[00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:52.360]   and I dash pod.com and I've been playing with this thing because I have two uses for it.
[00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:57.280]   One, it's it's like the world's easiest to transport camera holder because you don't
[00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:58.640]   have to have a big tripod.
[00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:01.680]   This little bean bag thing will fit almost anywhere.
[00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:05.400]   You screw your camera onto it and you've got the stability of shooting with a tripod
[00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:10.040]   but this thing will fit in your pocket and it has a non slip surface surface.
[00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:13.160]   Well, that was easy for me to say a non slip surface on it.
[00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:17.640]   So you can put it anywhere it doesn't fall off and it has the camera mount built right
[00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:18.880]   into it so it's very solid.
[00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:23.560]   So I actually walked around and like stuck it on top of cars on top of garbage cans
[00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:25.160]   and you got a rock solid shot.
[00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:26.720]   You could shoot like a 15th of a second.
[00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:27.720]   Is it heavy?
[00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:28.920]   It's not particularly heavy.
[00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:29.920]   That's what I liked about it.
[00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:31.000]   Where's the stability coming from?
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:36.560]   It just comes because it dissipates the energy of the camera over this these little beads
[00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:37.920]   inside the bean bag.
[00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:41.560]   So why wouldn't I just go to Jeffery's Toys down the street and buy a bean bag?
[00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:47.440]   You could but it wouldn't have a camera tripod mount screwed into it and it has this special
[00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:48.920]   surface that doesn't slip around.
[00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:51.000]   It's only 30 bucks.
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.600]   It's not terribly expensive but how I use them and some of you guys may have seen me
[00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:55.600]   doing this.
[00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:59.800]   I use it to support my little pocket digital field recorder because you get this thing
[00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:00.960]   called handling noise.
[00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:01.960]   You may have experienced that.
[00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:03.400]   I experienced that with the zoom.
[00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:04.400]   With the zoom.
[00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:07.280]   You're holding these little pocket field recorders and you're passing them around trying to get
[00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:09.280]   an interview and you hear this handling noise.
[00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:14.240]   If you screw one of these things to the bottom of your handheld recorder, you grab onto
[00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:20.360]   it by the bean bag, then you can move it around and there's no transference of any kind.
[00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:22.160]   Scrub it by the bean bag.
[00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:26.160]   Now you can also just set it on a table and you have a nice solid platform.
[00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:27.720]   So I use it for music.
[00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:29.880]   I use it for photography.
[00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:33.640]   It's called Omnipod, O-M-N-I-P-O-D dot com.
[00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:35.600]   It's about 30 bucks.
[00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:39.400]   If you're interested in photography and you want a simple way to put your camera someplace
[00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:43.760]   and take pictures with low light or if you want to do digital field recording, that is
[00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:44.760]   my pick.
[00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:45.760]   I'm sticking with it.
[00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:50.200]   Cool thing is about that is that you can actually not draw attention to yourself when
[00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:52.000]   you're trying to photograph stuff.
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:56.400]   One of the dumbest things you can do is set up a tripod because that's like, "Notice
[00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:57.400]   me."
[00:42:57.400 --> 00:42:58.400]   It's also San Francisco Law.
[00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:02.880]   If you put down a tripod, my friend Ben Durba told me this.
[00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:05.040]   You can drive around on a truck with a tripod.
[00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:07.640]   So if Ben and I drive around on a truck, we can go anywhere.
[00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:08.640]   You can stop it.
[00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:09.640]   It's all broken.
[00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:10.640]   Yeah, Alex, we have a truck.
[00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:13.560]   There are lots of places that ban tripods because of liability concerns.
[00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:16.760]   There's a great place that you can shoot butterflies down in Florida.
[00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:19.360]   It's a garden full of like a zillion butterflies.
[00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:24.320]   But they've got about 92 old ladies that are volunteers there and they strip search every
[00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:26.320]   person 12 times for tripods.
[00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:29.640]   I mean, there are no tripods allowed, but you can bring in the bean bag and you're cool
[00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:30.640]   to go.
[00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:34.240]   So butterflies and strip search find old lady, where do I sign up?
[00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:36.240]   Speaking of Valentine's Day.
[00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:38.240]   It's Christmas.
[00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:39.240]   Merlin.
[00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:49.400]   My software pick is the airport utility which shipped with my airport extreme that arrived
[00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:50.400]   yesterday.
[00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:51.400]   Wow.
[00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:52.400]   It's that good.
[00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:53.400]   That is so late.
[00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:54.400]   Yeah, I know.
[00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:55.760]   I didn't have software.
[00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:57.360]   I got an airport extreme.
[00:43:57.360 --> 00:43:58.960]   And you know, actually the software is really good.
[00:43:58.960 --> 00:43:59.960]   I've got to say.
[00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:01.960]   It's the N enabler.
[00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:06.080]   It's the N is the airport extreme with N that they've just started shipping.
[00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:07.960]   I arrived yesterday, like I say.
[00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:09.200]   I'll tell you what I like about it.
[00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:11.040]   One reason I got it.
[00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:16.440]   I'm still trying to figure out I was getting 14 megabits per second with the WRT54G and
[00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:17.440]   on my cable.
[00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:20.280]   And then I hooked this one up and I was getting like 2.5.
[00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:21.880]   So I think I need to rejigger.
[00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:23.120]   But I will tell you this.
[00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:24.120]   Here's what I love about it.
[00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:25.120]   Why does that make it a great app?
[00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:26.120]   That's what I'm asking.
[00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:29.160]   You're trying to recommend a great app here and you're saying I did it in the report.
[00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:32.320]   This is where a piece of text you'd see that I'm at the beginning third of a paragraph.
[00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:35.960]   So if I can just, if I could go ahead and...
[00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:39.280]   Now the reason I like it is what's nice about it though is it's easy to configure.
[00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:41.400]   Now this is the kind of thing that makes John roll his eyes at me.
[00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:48.640]   But I found it very hard to get WPA working with my airport expresses over the WRT54G.
[00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:49.640]   I know it's possible.
[00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:50.640]   But it's kind of hard.
[00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:53.120]   You've got to be using just a couple more initials and numbers.
[00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:54.880]   Those are all actually, I actually know what all this means.
[00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:55.880]   You don't have to download and install DDU.
[00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:56.880]   Here's what this means.
[00:44:56.880 --> 00:44:58.040]   Download and install DDU right.
[00:44:58.040 --> 00:44:59.840]   And then it will totally work.
[00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:01.120]   I should work with this VASsoft.
[00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:03.960]   I've just never got it working.
[00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:05.520]   Scott would have no idea if everything would go.
[00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:06.840]   You've got to get a new Johnson rod.
[00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:08.960]   From Mr. Your Flugo horn doesn't have enough...
[00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:09.960]   Valves.
[00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:10.960]   ...collectic fluid.
[00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:15.160]   So you're going to want to go ahead and drain that all the way down and bring in the WPA
[00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:18.040]   for the build down on that.
[00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:20.360]   But I'll tell you why I like it is it's very easy to configure.
[00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:24.120]   I'm about to two and a half megabits a second.
[00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:26.080]   One sixth of my former bandwidth.
[00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:27.080]   But I'll work that out.
[00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:29.880]   It's very easy to configure airport expresses of which I have four.
[00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:34.760]   And it's in the graphical interface for the airport utilities is really nice.
[00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:38.760]   I got to say this unit's beautiful.
[00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:40.200]   It's the same kind of rough...
[00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:44.360]   I haven't seen the Apple TV or anything but it's that same kind of...
[00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:45.360]   Six and a half inches.
[00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:46.360]   Six and a half inches.
[00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:47.360]   With roundy corners.
[00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:48.360]   That's right.
[00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:49.360]   It's very attractive.
[00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:50.640]   Oh, one thing I should mention.
[00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:51.960]   It turns out it's got...
[00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:54.000]   It's not as many ports as I thought.
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   One of those ports.
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.400]   This thing just continues to be a...
[00:45:57.400 --> 00:45:58.400]   So in closing.
[00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:02.040]   I'd like to recommend this even though it kept on getting worse and less than I wanted.
[00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:03.040]   Wait a minute.
[00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:05.360]   Let's just summarize for everybody why this is Merlin's pick.
[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:06.680]   It's slower bandwidth.
[00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:07.680]   It's slower bandwidth.
[00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:08.680]   Yeah.
[00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:09.680]   Number two, it has fewer ports than it is.
[00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:10.680]   It's got fewer ports than it is.
[00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:11.680]   I thought it did.
[00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:14.240]   Also sky it's a lot more expensive than my other one.
[00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:15.240]   It's a lot more expensive.
[00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:18.040]   Man, can I get three or four of these?
[00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:19.040]   And there's some more.
[00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:20.040]   Oh, there's more.
[00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:21.880]   So in closing my particular week.
[00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:24.320]   My Apple stock just tanked on account of you.
[00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:25.320]   Oh gosh.
[00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:27.360]   You lose more than a day that I'll make in my lifetime.
[00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:29.560]   I'm not that worried.
[00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:32.360]   So anyway, it's always looks promising.
[00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:36.720]   So Merlin's going to report back to us why he's recommended it next week.
[00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:37.720]   Can I just say one thing?
[00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:41.440]   I have been half understanding computers for 20 years.
[00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:42.440]   So I always...
[00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:45.320]   I've come to realize how often it is the nut behind the keyboard.
[00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:46.560]   Pilot error as they say.
[00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:49.120]   So I'm sure it's a configuration thing on my part.
[00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:52.040]   Also I upgraded to Cat 6 cables, which is speeding things up.
[00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:53.040]   I got this.
[00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:54.040]   Oh, you know what, John?
[00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:55.040]   I forgot about this offline.
[00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:56.360]   I got the gigabit switch.
[00:46:56.360 --> 00:46:58.000]   Definitely sped things up.
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   And I went...
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   And this is...
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.080]   Oh God, I'm having a bring for it.
[00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:04.400]   So it probably would be a good thing to talk about offline.
[00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:07.400]   I upgraded to either they're saying either 5e or 6.
[00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:08.400]   5e or 6.
[00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:09.400]   I went with 6.
[00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:11.400]   And I definitely was getting faster.
[00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:15.200]   In the last five minutes, you've used more acronyms, model numbers.
[00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:16.200]   And just wild combinations.
[00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:17.200]   How about...
[00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:18.200]   How about...
[00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:19.200]   How about KMA?
[00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:22.200]   Can you guess what that one is?
[00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:26.080]   So speedtest.net is my new favorite place to go check your bandwidth.
[00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:28.000]   And so in getting my new switch up and my new...
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   I used to use...
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   That's actually a great site.
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:31.000]   I used to use speed test on that.
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   I used to use speed test on that.
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   I used to use speed test on that.
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:34.920]   And now here's why I love speed test.
[00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:36.480]   Is it remembers your previous tests?
[00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:38.120]   And so you can kind of graph them over time.
[00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:40.640]   And that was the most confusing thing I've ever...
[00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:42.520]   That was the worst recommendations ever.
[00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:45.160]   So anyway, my sucky router is easy to test.
[00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:46.760]   Alex, what's your pick of the week?
[00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:47.760]   Banana.
[00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:48.760]   Alright.
[00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:49.760]   KMA.
[00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:50.760]   KMA.
[00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:53.240]   I have one that is not quite...
[00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:54.800]   You're going to be disappointed.
[00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:55.800]   Uh-oh.
[00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:56.800]   What percentage of an...
[00:47:56.800 --> 00:47:57.800]   It's one seventh of an Alex.
[00:47:57.800 --> 00:47:58.800]   A hundred bucks.
[00:47:58.800 --> 00:47:59.800]   A hundred bucks.
[00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:00.800]   What is it?
[00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:02.800]   Mine was more expensive than Alex's.
[00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:03.800]   Yeah.
[00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:05.120]   It's called movie logger.
[00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:06.120]   And I'm just starting to play with it.
[00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:09.800]   So I have to admit that I'm just digging into it, but it looks very, very promising.
[00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:10.800]   So what?
[00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:12.280]   This keeps track of all the movies that aren't very good.
[00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:13.280]   Yeah.
[00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:15.760]   So is this a port of that old Newton app?
[00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:16.760]   It is not...
[00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:18.800]   I mean, the great thing about the Newton app was...
[00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:20.480]   And there was one for the Palm Pilot.
[00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:23.920]   Where you could be sitting on set doing this stuff, getting time code live, and it was
[00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:25.280]   keeping track of all of that.
[00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:26.280]   And I don't think it does...
[00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:30.000]   It doesn't do that because it's not on the live process.
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:34.800]   But as I said, the big thing here is that you're going to want to...
[00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:39.800]   You know, a lot of this stuff, it can export to the XML, which means that you can bring
[00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:41.440]   a lot of stuff back into Final Cut.
[00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:43.760]   So, you know, and convert that data.
[00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:46.080]   The great thing, one of the great things, this is just an underlying thing.
[00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:50.360]   One of the big reasons that we use Final Cut Pro Studio for pretty much the entire pipeline
[00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:55.360]   here is specifically because of the XML backend.
[00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:58.720]   We will use an Apple app, even when sometimes another app will...
[00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:02.720]   We think might do a little bit better because I have that XML, which means, for those of
[00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:06.320]   you listening, XML is cool because it means it's a text document.
[00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:08.720]   The entire project file is a text document.
[00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:12.600]   If I want to write a Python script that says, "Change all this stuff, move the keyframes,
[00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:18.040]   do all this other stuff," I can do all of that stuff by just hashing through text.
[00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:19.040]   But I don't have to...
[00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:20.680]   And it's very modestly sized, pound for a pound.
[00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:21.680]   Yeah.
[00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:22.680]   I don't really care about the size.
[00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:24.920]   I don't care if it's 10 times every bottom line that you get a hold of it.
[00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:28.680]   Or even like an iMovie where it's going to store all of your movie stuff in that one
[00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:29.680]   file.
[00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:30.680]   And the big thing is...
[00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:34.680]   So anyway, by XML is like the magic bullet and this thing supports that.
[00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:37.560]   But what it lets you do is, as I said, you can go through it, you can figure out what
[00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:39.920]   clips you want to keep, what you don't want to keep.
[00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:40.920]   It's a great way to...
[00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:44.040]   You don't want to have Final Cut for your producer, for instance.
[00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:46.080]   We've got a producer that's working on our show.
[00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:49.240]   I don't want every person that needs to log to have Final Cut.
[00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:53.680]   And I also don't want everyone to be opening quick time and writing stuff down in FileMaker
[00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:55.320]   or trying to figure out how to...
[00:49:55.320 --> 00:49:56.320]   This is the way you manage it.
[00:49:56.320 --> 00:49:57.320]   You actually annotate this?
[00:49:57.320 --> 00:49:58.320]   Can you go like, "This is the point."
[00:49:58.320 --> 00:49:59.320]   That's what you're doing.
[00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:00.320]   You're annotating it.
[00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:01.320]   And it's keeping track of the time.
[00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:02.320]   I'm totally going to use this.
[00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:03.320]   Oh, it is...
[00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:04.320]   It's nifty.
[00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:07.160]   There's another app called CatDV, which isn't too bad to doing this.
[00:50:07.160 --> 00:50:08.840]   I think this is a lot cleaner.
[00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:10.720]   I think the interface is cleaner than CatDV.
[00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:14.160]   I think CatDV is interesting because it will...
[00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:18.920]   CatDV will actually catalog enormous numbers of tapes so that you can always go back to
[00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:20.480]   them and find what you wanted.
[00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:23.240]   And it'll keep low-res versions and do a lot of that stuff.
[00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:26.920]   The issue is that we don't do that much anymore.
[00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:30.280]   We pull stuff off tapes and then we put the tapes somewhere in dry storage, but we're
[00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:33.600]   never going to open them again unless something really bad happens.
[00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:34.920]   So having this stuff work through...
[00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:36.800]   It's a nice clean interface.
[00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:37.800]   It is...
[00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:39.160]   As I said, I haven't gotten...
[00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:43.560]   I'm sure that a week or two from now, I'll have all the things I don't like about it.
[00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:47.320]   But I just started playing with it and I'm pretty excited.
[00:50:47.320 --> 00:50:48.320]   That's it.
[00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:49.320]   Movie Log?
[00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:50.320]   Movie Logger.
[00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:54.280]   And the company that makes it is a company called Digital Heaven.
[00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:57.680]   And Digital Heaven makes a bunch of cool...
[00:50:57.680 --> 00:51:01.920]   They make a lot of stuff that's wrapped around taking advantage of this kind of stuff.
[00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:06.600]   So Final Print, which prints out the key images from one edit.
[00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:09.200]   Movie Logger, they have some Final Cut plugins.
[00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:14.000]   They want called Automotion, which automatically builds lower thirds.
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:18.280]   So you have a database of 60 people and you have the template of the lower thirds and you
[00:51:18.280 --> 00:51:22.560]   run it through it and it builds 60 lower thirds like that.
[00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:26.080]   And if you want to change them, you change the database, change the lower thirds.
[00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:27.080]   That's it.
[00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:31.640]   Well, speaking of exciting, Alex, March 28th, what's happening?
[00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:38.600]   On March 28th, Scott Born, Leo Laporte and myself will be at the Zeeum.
[00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:41.200]   The Zeeum, by the way, is right next to the Moscone Center.
[00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:45.200]   It's this beautiful theater and we're going to be talking about podcasting.
[00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:47.560]   And that's Moscone Center in San Francisco.
[00:51:47.560 --> 00:51:48.560]   That's correct.
[00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:49.560]   And we're going to do a conference.
[00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:51.200]   It's like a seminar, a three-day seminar.
[00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:53.240]   You are going to reveal secrets.
[00:51:53.240 --> 00:51:58.520]   You have never, ever before revealed in public about doing video for the web and podcasting.
[00:51:58.520 --> 00:51:59.520]   Pretty much.
[00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:03.320]   Find out all of the companies that are dead to Alex.
[00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:07.480]   So it is literally going to be a bleed from your ears.
[00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:11.720]   When we put it together, it was just like, I was like, I don't even know.
[00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:14.600]   I guess it's super dense.
[00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:15.600]   Intensive.
[00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:19.720]   And Leo, of course, being probably the most recognized podcaster, he's going to share
[00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:20.800]   a lot of stuff.
[00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:22.240]   I'm going to talk about audio.
[00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:23.240]   It's three days.
[00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:24.240]   It's $2.99.
[00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:27.440]   We've already sold like the first day, 10% of the seats.
[00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:28.440]   Yeah.
[00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:29.440]   It's moving pretty quickly.
[00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:31.560]   So you can get information at Pixel Core.
[00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:32.760]   You can get information at Pixel Core.
[00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:36.040]   You can also, we're going to have, by the time this show goes up, we'll have, it'll
[00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:38.640]   actually be on probably on Twit.tv and it'll definitely be in the show notes.
[00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:41.560]   We'll have a link to the main page.
[00:52:41.560 --> 00:52:48.000]   And it's being made possible by Pod Dango and bswusa.com.
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:49.560]   Everybody stop by and say hi.
[00:52:49.560 --> 00:52:50.560]   So it's not $700.
[00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:51.560]   No, it's not.
[00:52:51.560 --> 00:52:52.560]   It could have been.
[00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:54.560]   It's less than half an Alex.
[00:52:54.560 --> 00:52:59.000]   And Ed has said it's really a lot of the, all the stuff we've been learning over the
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:00.760]   last two years of doing this.
[00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:02.280]   And we're going to do some live shows.
[00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:06.760]   Brad, we're doing that iLife Zone show.
[00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:10.480]   We're going to be doing an episode of Mac Break and I believe we're going to have Leo
[00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:12.440]   doing Twit with the guys.
[00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:15.200]   And it's great doing it in the theater.
[00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:17.880]   It's this gorgeous, super comfortable theater.
[00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:18.880]   We're really excited.
[00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:20.440]   It's kid-friendly.
[00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:21.440]   It is kid-friendly.
[00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:22.440]   How about that?
[00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:24.120]   Unlike the show.
[00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:25.560]   Unlike the show, yes.
[00:53:25.560 --> 00:53:26.560]   This specific show.
[00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:27.560]   The show is fine.
[00:53:27.560 --> 00:53:28.560]   Just fine.
[00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:32.040]   Alex is going to cut out a whole lot of that stuff toward the end.
[00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:35.000]   I'm cutting nothing out.
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:36.560]   They're going to complain on the forum.
[00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:38.360]   There goes the gleaned egg.
[00:53:38.360 --> 00:53:39.360]   We didn't say anything.
[00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:40.360]   Did we actually say anything?
[00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:41.360]   I don't think we did.
[00:53:41.360 --> 00:53:42.360]   KMA.
[00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:45.320]   That's a campground where you can go and...
[00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:47.680]   Yeah, exactly what that is.
[00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:49.560]   I didn't say the rest of it.
[00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:51.000]   John, where can people talk to you?
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:54.480]   If you want to talk to me, you have to go to twit.tv/forms.
[00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:57.800]   You have to pay two bucks and you can type questions by...
[00:53:57.800 --> 00:54:01.440]   Every time you say that, I imagine you being like a carnival barker who's standing out
[00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:05.120]   in front of a straw boater, collecting a couple bucks from each person who wants to
[00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:06.120]   go in.
[00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:08.120]   Come on in and come into the forums.
[00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:09.120]   Come in and whine about the sound quality.
[00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:12.200]   I didn't want to be a restroom with the guy with the little...
[00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:15.960]   We could also go to my other new venture, but I'm not going to talk about it.
[00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:16.960]   Awwww.
[00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:17.960]   You want me to?
[00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:18.960]   Well, save that for next month.
[00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:19.960]   Come on.
[00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:20.960]   It's Christmas.
[00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:25.120]   It's beerschool.com where you can learn all about how you and your friends can learn
[00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:27.200]   to drink more than one kind of beer.
[00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:29.640]   Finally, something you really know a lot about.
[00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:32.080]   I know a lot more about beer than I know...
[00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:33.080]   No, it's not true.
[00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:34.400]   John has a PhD in beer.
[00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:36.440]   I should get an honorary degree.
[00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:37.440]   Yeah.
[00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:38.440]   Yeah, that's my fault.
[00:54:38.440 --> 00:54:39.440]   That's cool.
[00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:44.920]   I probably ought to mention my newest endeavor, applephoneshow.com.
[00:54:44.920 --> 00:54:49.960]   For some reason, people got the idea that the iPhone and me would make a great blog and
[00:54:49.960 --> 00:54:50.960]   podcast.
[00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:56.680]   So, Chris Breen from Macworld Magazine is going to bring the regular news from the Macworld
[00:54:56.680 --> 00:54:58.000]   news desk about the iPhone.
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:54:59.560]   And I'm going to do a blog about it.
[00:54:59.560 --> 00:55:01.480]   We're going to have a show that launches in March.
[00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:04.120]   It's an audio podcast all about the iPhone.
[00:55:04.120 --> 00:55:06.960]   Now, some people seem to think that's what Mac Break Weekly is all about.
[00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:08.400]   But, you know, we're going to reduce our time.
[00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:09.680]   Get to extend the brand, Scott.
[00:55:09.680 --> 00:55:10.680]   We got to extend the brand.
[00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:15.120]   You know, we're going to take the drinking game over to applephoneshow.com.
[00:55:15.120 --> 00:55:16.120]   And if you go...
[00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:18.560]   You and John should do a thing together where we have iPhones in in beer.
[00:55:18.560 --> 00:55:19.560]   Yeah.
[00:55:19.560 --> 00:55:20.560]   Well, you know what?
[00:55:20.560 --> 00:55:21.560]   I know how to sync an iPhone.
[00:55:21.560 --> 00:55:22.560]   There you go.
[00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:25.400]   You need to fire your entire writing staff, John.
[00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:30.160]   Just top down.
[00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:32.120]   Guys, you got to go.
[00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:33.520]   Where can they find that?
[00:55:33.520 --> 00:55:35.080]   ApplephoneShow.com.
[00:55:35.080 --> 00:55:40.560]   And the podcast will be available in March at pedango.com.
[00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:41.560]   Merlin Man.
[00:55:41.560 --> 00:55:44.760]   I closed all my sites this week.
[00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:47.400]   As you know, I have 119 websites.
[00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:48.400]   And you know what I said this week?
[00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:49.400]   I said screw it.
[00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:50.400]   I'm closing them down.
[00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:51.400]   I'm shutting the doors.
[00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:52.400]   That phone guy is gone.
[00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:53.400]   All gone.
[00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:54.400]   Gone.
[00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:57.320]   I've said everything that I wanted to say.
[00:55:57.320 --> 00:55:58.840]   I've repeated myself a lot.
[00:55:58.840 --> 00:55:59.840]   MerlinMan.com.
[00:55:59.840 --> 00:56:01.480]   That was the first one to go.
[00:56:01.480 --> 00:56:03.040]   That thing was dead weight.
[00:56:03.040 --> 00:56:04.120]   Blah, blah, blah.
[00:56:04.120 --> 00:56:05.120]   Here's me.
[00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:06.120]   Blah, blah.
[00:56:06.120 --> 00:56:09.560]   Hey, look, I'm on the iPod.
[00:56:09.560 --> 00:56:10.560]   Yeah.
[00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:11.880]   Yeah, so they're all closed down.
[00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:12.880]   But anyway, yes.
[00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:20.560]   If you want to find me, go to twit.tv and ask John to give me a call on his Facebook.
[00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:22.760]   Hey, Alex.
[00:56:22.760 --> 00:56:26.080]   You know, Alex, I get sick of asking you this question each week.
[00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:27.680]   I know the kids get sick of hearing it.
[00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:31.720]   When are you going to have some kind of an internet presence to which we can send people
[00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:35.720]   beyond one of those photos of you that somebody took on the Pixel Corp page?
[00:56:35.720 --> 00:56:38.120]   When are you going to start giving back to the kids in the community?
[00:56:38.120 --> 00:56:40.120]   Alex, whenzkma.com.
[00:56:40.120 --> 00:56:41.120]   Oh, Jesus.
[00:56:41.120 --> 00:56:45.120]   I, the Pixel Corp is my thing.
[00:56:45.120 --> 00:56:46.960]   You should get on Twitter.
[00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:48.480]   Twitter will be the perfect medium for you.
[00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:49.480]   No.
[00:56:49.480 --> 00:56:50.480]   No.
[00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:51.480]   Dead to you?
[00:56:51.480 --> 00:56:52.480]   Dead to me.
[00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:53.480]   I'd like to say it dead to me.
[00:56:53.480 --> 00:56:54.480]   I'd like to say DTM.
[00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:56.480]   I mean, I'm now shortening it.
[00:56:56.480 --> 00:56:57.480]   It's just DTM.
[00:56:57.480 --> 00:56:58.480]   DTM.
[00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:02.080]   We were, we had trouble with free, we were trying to do a show with free conference call
[00:57:02.080 --> 00:57:03.080]   the other night, other day.
[00:57:03.080 --> 00:57:05.120]   Uh oh, is it, is it DTM?
[00:57:05.120 --> 00:57:08.520]   For the third time I couldn't call through and I just emailed it out.
[00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:10.320]   I didn't even, I didn't even, I didn't even.
[00:57:10.320 --> 00:57:11.320]   Is that worse than Skype?
[00:57:11.320 --> 00:57:12.720]   No, no, actually that's so bad.
[00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:13.720]   Pre-conference.
[00:57:13.720 --> 00:57:14.720]   DTAOU.
[00:57:14.720 --> 00:57:15.720]   Really?
[00:57:15.720 --> 00:57:16.720]   Dead to all of us.
[00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:17.720]   Yeah.
[00:57:17.720 --> 00:57:18.720]   Is that worse than Skype?
[00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:19.720]   What's worse?
[00:57:19.720 --> 00:57:20.720]   Skype.
[00:57:20.720 --> 00:57:21.720]   So it's a dead to me, dead to me throw down.
[00:57:21.720 --> 00:57:22.720]   So it's call or Skype?
[00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:23.720]   This can be a whole show.
[00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:26.120]   See, Skype is protected by the Leo Aura.
[00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:31.000]   So I can't, I can't kill it off yet, but, but, but free conference call is definitely
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:32.000]   DTM.
[00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:35.440]   But those of you at home that can't see it, Alex does have a little Skype voodoo doll with
[00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:37.520]   pins in it on his desk.
[00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:38.840]   You were so frustrated last week.
[00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:39.840]   He looks so sad.
[00:57:39.840 --> 00:57:42.520]   Look at, see this is what happens when you use Skype.
[00:57:42.520 --> 00:57:46.200]   It's, this little statue has its head cut off.
[00:57:46.200 --> 00:57:48.280]   I was, I don't like Skype.
[00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:52.160]   This has been Mac Break Weekly or something that resembles it.
[00:57:52.160 --> 00:57:54.160]   Break time is over.
[00:57:54.160 --> 00:57:55.160]   Actually we're broken.
[00:57:55.160 --> 00:57:57.160]   So let me get this one.
[00:57:57.160 --> 00:57:58.160]   This one, this one has been broken.
[00:57:58.160 --> 00:58:03.120]   You guys are going to do a seminar with podcasters about podcasting at which you're
[00:58:03.120 --> 00:58:05.120]   going to do a podcast.
[00:58:05.120 --> 00:58:06.120]   Wouldn't it be more fun?
[00:58:06.120 --> 00:58:07.120]   It could be any better.
[00:58:07.120 --> 00:58:09.840]   Well, you know what, if you, we're going to do it for three hours straight.
[00:58:09.840 --> 00:58:10.840]   Have a suggestion.
[00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:11.840]   Three days.
[00:58:11.840 --> 00:58:14.420]   (upbeat music)
[00:58:14.420 --> 00:58:17.000]   (upbeat music)
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:24.000]   (upbeat music)
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:29.000]   (upbeat music)
[00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:39.000]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
