[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.320]   new iPhones later this year.
[00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.600]   And perhaps Apple TV for gaming.

[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.440]   Renee Ritchie, hello Renee.
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.120]   >> Yo, it's so good to see you again.
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.480]   >> It's such a happy Tuesday.
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.200]   >> Lovely to see you again.
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.600]   How are things in Renee Land?
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.320]   >> I almost completely moved in.
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.760]   You can see this area is quasi-finished and the rest of the place actually exists now.
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.960]   So I'm way less stressed and much happier.
[00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:42.960]   >> Good.
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:43.960]   It looks beautiful.
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:44.960]   >> Thank you.
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.960]   >> And of course he's doing this not for us but because Vector is now on video.
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.120]   >> Well, it was inspired by you, Leo.
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.960]   Like I said, 95% of the stuff in here was completely inspired by stuff that you did.
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.480]   If you had told me I would have said don't do video whenever you do video.
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.680]   That's an amazing amount of complexity and expense.
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.680]   >> Or way less content for way less content.
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.680]   >> Yes.
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.600]   But you know what, I like it and I think one of the reasons I'm glad we do videos because
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.520]   I think you develop bonds with people that when you can see them even if you don't watch
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.760]   it every day, you see them once.
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.320]   Now you kind of get the sense of space.
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.320]   >> Remember Scott Forestel's like you can look into your son's eyes and say how are you
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.320]   doing?
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.320]   >> How are you doing son?
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.080]   >> I miss Scott Forestel.
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.200]   >> What's the difference between the two of you?
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.200]   >> I'm not sure.
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.200]   >> I'm not sure.
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.200]   >> I'm not sure.
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.200]   >> I'm not sure.
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.200]   >> I'm not sure.
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.200]   >> I'm not sure.
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.200]   >> I'm not sure.
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.200]   >> But I'm sure you're doing it.
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.200]   I'm sure you're doing it.
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.200]   >> I'm sure you're doing it.
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.200]   >> I'm sure you're doing it.
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.200]   >> I'm sure you're doing it.
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.200]   >> I'm sure you're doing it.
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.200]   >> I'm sure you're doing it.
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.200]   >> I'm sure you're doing it.
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.200]   >> I'm sure you're doing it.
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.200]   >> I'm sure you're doing it.
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.200]   >> I'm sure you're doing it.
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.200]   >> I'm sure you're doing it.
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.200]   >> I'm sure you're doing it.
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:58.080]   >> I'm sure you're doing it.
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.560]   >> Lovely to have both of you.
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:05.520]   Today we will be discussing many things in the Appleverse, including Apple following
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:12.560]   in the footsteps of Amazon, I think, by creating it while starting to work on its own health
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.360]   services for its employees.
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.360]   >> Yeah, that's great news.
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.640]   >> I mean, it's sad that we need to do it, but it's great news.
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.840]   >> Yeah, exactly.
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.800]   It's a sign that you really, if you have that kind of scale and you really want to deliver
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.800]   the goods for your employees, you really have to create your own health service.
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.240]   Otherwise, you spend not only is it a good thing to do if your employees, if you do it
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:38.920]   right, but also it actually saves you money because there's so few, fewer follow-ups,
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.000]   you're basically responsible for everything.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.680]   You're no longer responsible for fixing other people's mistakes.
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.680]   >> Apple is launching, it's going to be called AC Wellness.
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.440]   I wonder if it'll be called AppleCare for you, for your body.
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.000]   >> And AppleCare Plus, if you're really in here.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.280]   Two clinics, both in Santa Clara County, where Apple's headquarters is, but Apple has how
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.160]   many tens of thousands of employees in that area, like 45,000 or something.
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:09.560]   They're advertising for doctors, health coaches, and of course, it's Apple, designers.
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:15.160]   >> Well, I love that they're thinking a lot about prevention too, because the US, we
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.600]   all know the state of the US, healthcare, and Canadian healthcare, a lot of the preventative
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.480]   healthcare workers opted out of Medicare.
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.520]   So we really don't have a lot of preventative health.
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:23.880]   We have it, but you still have to pay for it.
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:24.880]   It's not included in Medicare.
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.880]   >> You don't get preventative healthcare in Canada?
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.920]   >> Very little, if you have a problem, you can go there and they'll fix it.
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:31.920]   And it's amazing.
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.480]   >> They don't pay for checkups.
[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:38.400]   >> They pay for very basic stuff, but there's a whole slew of preventative medicine that
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.160]   countries, like the Scandinavian countries pay for, that just aren't covered in Medicare.
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.480]   And it's a whole historical thing about different medical unions not wanting to join
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.480]   in and all these things.
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:52.180]   >> Seems like a mistake, because you save money on healthcare if you do preventative
[00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:53.180]   care.
[00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.720]   That's less expensive and presumably a lot less expensive than a heart attack.
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:58.720]   >> Absolutely.
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.040]   And if you start covering things like Apple's going to be doing a wide range of fitness
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:05.880]   consultations and planning and dietary consulates, and that's a literally say, it's any's on
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.200]   the dollar to what you'll pay for actual medical treatments.
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.200]   >> Yeah.
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.200]   Yeah.
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.160]   There's a lot of weird math behind that.
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:18.960]   As I looked into this about a month ago for a different story, it turns out that encouraging
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.040]   people to come in, basically setting up an infrastructure so that if someone says, gee,
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.480]   I somehow don't feel right, I'm going to have a doctor look at me, setting up a cheap way
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:31.000]   to have that happen does pay off, setting up so that people who are particularly people
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.600]   who have high risk of certain cancers get their screenings on a timely basis.
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.760]   Like again, if you're both your parents had a certain type of cancer, you should probably
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:44.960]   be and this person is covered under your policy, it is probably a good idea to pay for the
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.120]   relatively inexpensive cancer screenings that can catch a stage one or stage two before
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.560]   it gets to a stage four.
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:55.760]   It's other, but it's other things like wellness programs are kind of an interesting balance
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.680]   point where there's a lot of money, you put a lot of money into the wellness program,
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:05.040]   but you don't necessarily get it back in terms of better health for the client or fewer or
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:10.400]   fewer claims because there's so much of this that's based on genetics.
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:15.920]   But yeah, remember that HMOs, however, were first proposed as, hey, look, if we're going
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:21.200]   to have instead of having the old fashioned style of insurance, if we have our providers
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:25.880]   be actually actively involved in our health, it could only be that if you're investing
[00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.720]   in this person's health, there'll be fewer claims, but actually kind of turned out to
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:34.400]   be the reverse of that where the HMOs created their own brand of problems once they figured
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.280]   out where the loopholes are and how to, again, ban people from coverage.
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:39.840]   So look at this.
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:41.040]   This is very progressive.
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.040]   Apple's hiring.
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:48.280]   If you go to acwellness.com/careers, of course, traditional doctors and nurse practitioners,
[00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:52.760]   but also health partners who works in direct partnership with the primary care physician
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:57.800]   to help patients improve their health and wellness through sustainable behavior change,
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:04.080]   health partner behavioral health, clinical exercise coach.
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.080]   Care navigator.
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:08.480]   A care navigator sets the tone for the patient experience.
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:12.760]   It sounds like a receptionist, whether it's the patient's first phone call or their first
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:14.800]   interaction with a team member entering the center.
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.360]   Yeah, it's a receptionist.
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:18.840]   Medical assistant works with the care team.
[00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:19.840]   Oh, yes.
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:20.840]   It's a botanist, my favorite word.
[00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:21.840]   It's a botanist.
[00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:22.840]   It's funny that they're calling.
[00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:25.240]   I mean, that's the people who obviously draw blood for blood tests, but I guess they must
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.240]   need me to a lot of them.
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.240]   I don't know.
[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:32.320]   Medical assistant works with the care team to create a frictionless experience for patients
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:36.640]   of the Wellness Center, coordinating care, nurse coordinator.
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.440]   Again, frictionless.
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:39.440]   There's a lot.
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.920]   They're really working on lubricating the experience.
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:46.520]   You blasted aluminum hot clothes, Leo.
[00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:48.120]   It's real.
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:50.240]   I guess it's a necessity.
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:57.720]   I wonder though, we've seen Apple, Google, Microsoft with ambitions in health back when
[00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:02.320]   there was an initiative to get all the patient health records digitized.
[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:04.920]   I think everybody saw that as a gold rush.
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:12.240]   And then both Apple and Google decided to pull out of it, realizing they were pitfalls.
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:17.440]   But I wonder now, if the next big thing for these giant corporations is creating healthcare.
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:22.440]   First, I mean, Amazon, you've got to think Amazon is not merely thinking about healthcare
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:25.920]   for its employees, but ultimately about creating a business.
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:29.400]   There are healthcare retail transactions to get a piece of their Leo.
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:32.080]   Wouldn't you want to have Apple healthcare?
[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:33.880]   I buy it.
[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:38.520]   Again, it's always going to be great for the first five years.
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:42.480]   It's in 10 years when the numbers are really coming in and they figure out what this is
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:43.480]   costing them.
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:50.160]   Only a company like Google or Apple or Amazon could do this because remember that you can't
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:54.720]   create a healthcare program with the idea that is going to be profitable or even break
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:55.720]   even.
[00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:59.560]   So you're creating a covenant with people that says that if you're giving us this money every
[00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:03.400]   single month for taking this money out of your paycheck, we will have your back if you
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:04.440]   get into a health problem.
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:08.840]   And so eventually after 10 years, you get enough data in this system to figure out where
[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.480]   the huge losses of money are.
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:18.880]   And frankly, in the less ethical arenas, what people can be sort of put off and stalled
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:20.600]   before it pay.
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:24.760]   If someone's basically coming to you for what's going to be $830,000 for the treatment and
[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:29.600]   you figure that will only cost you about $380,000 to litigate your way out of this.
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:33.640]   At some point, the person who's in charge of making sure that that part of the operation
[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:38.800]   doesn't sink the company is going to opt for the evil option.
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:44.360]   So it's going to be, I think these things could work really well if it's all with an
[00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:45.360]   Apple.
[00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:47.200]   You remember how many employees an Apple has?
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.640]   They can do it at that scale.
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:52.720]   It would be a lot more difficult once you try to make it bigger than that.
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:59.920]   Once you're trying to provide health care for people that aren't quite so dependent on
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:01.640]   you for your livelihood.
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:05.720]   As part of an integrated service, which we all know Apple is so good at, that could
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:06.720]   work really well.
[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:09.360]   It'll be a totally separate business if they're doing it outside.
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:12.520]   But the data collection would be valuable in and of itself.
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:14.320]   There's a precedent for this, of course.
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:18.920]   My health care comes through a company called Kaiser Permanente, which was founded by Henry
[00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:23.720]   Kaiser, an industrialist in the '30s, for his workers.
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:28.520]   They form an insurance consortium and it's an HMO.
[00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:29.920]   It's in the Western States.
[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:40.880]   It ended up being, I was just looking at numbers, they have 64 billion in revenue, 208,000
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:43.280]   employees, 21,000 physicians.
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:48.720]   It's a massive health care system created privately, but by a company.
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:51.800]   And so there is a precedent for Amazon and Apple to do this.
[00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:58.520]   This is what AC Wellness Network is saying on their web pages is the Apple Wellness Network.
[00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:03.920]   Believes in having trusting accessible relationships with our patients, enabled by technology,
[00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:07.320]   promotes high quality care and a unique patient experience.
[00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:11.880]   This is fostered by an environment of continuous learning and teamwork, which in turn allows
[00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:16.040]   us to work with our patients to achieve exceptional health outcomes.
[00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:20.840]   The center offers a unique concierge-like health care experience for employees and their
[00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:21.840]   dependents.
[00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:30.560]   Now, it may be, you know, there's such competition for talent between Facebook, Amazon, Apple,
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:32.800]   Google, especially in Silicon Valley.
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:39.360]   It's bitter that anything you can do, that's why you got free food and ping pong tables
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:40.360]   and all this.
[00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:45.440]   They're really trying to make it up, you know, especially for the smart engineering
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:48.720]   students coming out of college, they're trying to make it a desirable pick.
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:50.280]   And of course, number one is stock options.
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:54.880]   I think most people working at these companies, looking at the value of the stock and Apple's
[00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:56.720]   got a good shot there.
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:12:02.360]   But I would imagine something like this, health care for you and your dependents that's better
[00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:04.920]   than you can get otherwise would be great.
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:09.240]   And I imagine it also at a certain scale saves Apple money.
[00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:12.880]   But I still love the fantasy that this might become available to people who don't work
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:14.880]   for Apple at some point.
[00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:18.960]   If that were their only goal, then they could, they have enough employees that they could
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:22.640]   muscle an insurance company, just like they were the muscle AT&T when they had the, when
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:26.720]   they were introducing the iPhone to give us concessions, give our, give our iPhone customer
[00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:31.680]   service that like no other service plan on any other, any other phone anywhere.
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:36.240]   So if they did want to go to Kaiser Permanente or whoever and say, here are our terms, you
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:38.600]   have to cover cancer screenings.
[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:41.960]   You have to have a super, super, super low deductible.
[00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:46.720]   You have to have walk-ins so that people can, a flat fee of $15 anytime.
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:49.040]   They've just got a, hey, I'm just kind of not feeling right.
[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:50.680]   I need to get something checked out.
[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:56.440]   And then any of these companies would be thrilled to get these 100,000 employees on
[00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:57.440]   their roles.
[00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:01.440]   So it's, I don't think that they're, they're up to anything, anything quirky here.
[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:06.120]   But you also have to think about all the information they get about how American healthcare works
[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:08.640]   or how the world, even the world wide healthcare works.
[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:13.200]   Not by, not by stealing information from their, from their employees, but just by simply
[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:14.600]   being at the top of this pyramid.
[00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:20.200]   I, I, yeah, there's, it's, I mean, I could make the presentation to Tim Cook.
[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:25.240]   This is, these are the 12 great reasons for you to do this.
[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:26.480]   It doesn't surprise me at all.
[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:28.480]   And you know, the first one is the most obvious.
[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:30.120]   It's, it'll help you with hiring.
[00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:33.160]   It's good for your employees, but there are a lot of benefits to Apple.
[00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:37.360]   There's also the Cook Doctrine, the one that Horace did you define so well where, you
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:41.640]   know, Tim Cook likes to enter areas where he believes that Apple can offer a unique,
[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:46.120]   differentiated experience and significantly change the way the industry currently works.
[00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:49.520]   And it, it, it, it, healthcare has all the hallmarks of that.
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:53.080]   And to do it at a retail scale, at a, at a commercial scale for everybody is hard, but
[00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:57.440]   to start it at least on a, on a company scale like you said, makes all the sense in the world.
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:00.440]   It's inter, it is very interesting, isn't it?
[00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:02.640]   Because we've been talking, we've been talking for a while.
[00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:03.880]   What, what's Apple's next thing?
[00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:08.120]   And Apple's obviously, that's a big, big challenge for them corporate.
[00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:11.080]   You know, 70% of revenues come from the iPhone.
[00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:16.280]   You can't, you know, you, you have a duty as Tim Cook and the, the executives at Apple
[00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:19.840]   to think of, well, what happens 10 years from now?
[00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:24.640]   And I, I like this a lot better than self-driving cars to be on.
[00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:27.600]   I think there's something there and something that's cool.
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:29.000]   It folds in technology they're already making.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.520]   They're pushing heavy on fitness and health with Apple watch and, and with next generation
[00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:36.640]   products and all of that will fold right into the, the, the new upcoming patient records
[00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:38.280]   for iOS and for watch OS.
[00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:39.960]   It all folds in very neatly for them.
[00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:44.040]   Even if you don't make it a business, there's businesses that could come out of it.
[00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:48.800]   You know, it helps the watch, but also, you know, you could, you know, one of the things
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:56.440]   Apple could do is, is create Apple based healthcare software and hardware for medical practices
[00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:57.600]   and hospitals, right?
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:58.600]   That's, that could be a big business.
[00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:00.320]   There's lots of ways you can go with this.
[00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:01.320]   Anyway, I like it.
[00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:02.320]   I thought it was very interesting.
[00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:05.920]   I'm not seeing that even it could pay off for ordinary people.
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:09.640]   Even if it just turns into lobbying efforts, if they see the pain points in the system
[00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:13.920]   and somebody say, here is a, here is a law that would prove that in our, us being our
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:20.240]   own healthcare provider prevents us from having two families under one, under one matriarch
[00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:22.840]   or patriarch that needs different kinds of service.
[00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:26.200]   If you were to remove this, we could actually give better healthcare to these people for
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:29.320]   less money and suddenly getting that, that, that law passed.
[00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:31.280]   Yeah, really cool.
[00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:38.400]   Lots of rumors about Apple and I think we have to give credit to Mark Gurman and Bloomberg,
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:39.400]   right?
[00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:41.840]   If Mark says it, it's better than if Mingchi Quo says it.
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:45.160]   Is that, is that, well, I mean, I love Mark, but this, this is the Mingchi Quo rumor.
[00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:46.160]   Yeah.
[00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:47.160]   Oh, is it?
[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:48.880]   Oh, so Mark's regurgitating it, huh?
[00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:49.880]   Well, it's not regurgitating.
[00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:52.840]   Like it's, I guess like you call this like one source and then you get two sources and
[00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:56.720]   then you get the case leaks and then you get the, the manufacturing renders and it's all
[00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:01.600]   part, it is, it is part of the seven seal on your way to iPhone, apocalypse.
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:02.600]   Is it credible?
[00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:09.480]   We're talking about the Apple plans giant, giant high end iPhone and a lower priced model.
[00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:11.080]   In fact, you're right.
[00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:16.600]   Mingchi Quo also said three phones this year, the largest iPhone ever.
[00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:19.520]   I think they said 6.5 inches, right?
[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:23.560]   The largest screen, I think last I heard it was still roughly the same size as a plus
[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:26.560]   iPhone because that's, you know, they're a limits to the human hand, but it will be
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:27.560]   the largest screen ever.
[00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:31.120]   So imagine an iPhone eight with an edge to edge screen and that's basically what you're
[00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:32.120]   talking about.
[00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:33.120]   Yeah.
[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:34.840]   There were, there were, there were a lot of complaints from users about how they love
[00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:39.280]   the iPhone 10, but the screen feels smaller to them than the iPhone eight plus the iPhone
[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:40.640]   seven plus screen that came from.
[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:45.520]   So I can certainly believe that it's funny because Lisa and I both playing with our iPhone
[00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:49.720]   10s, just the other day said, but this, I love the Scott sides of the screen.
[00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:54.640]   It's not as big as, but again, it might be hand feel as opposed to screen.
[00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:58.680]   It's also optical because Apple made a deliberate choice not to use the split view controller.
[00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:02.360]   Like for the iPhone, I'll bring all the way back to iPhone six and six plus.
[00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:04.920]   iPhone six was a standard iPhone, just a little bit bigger.
[00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:07.840]   iPhone six plus got a split view controller, got more columns.
[00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:11.240]   They used more of the real estate than when they went to the iPhone 10 because it's a
[00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:13.920]   little bit, I mean, it's taller, but it's not as wide.
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:17.120]   And they felt it was a better experience to stick with that single view, that single
[00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:18.200]   column view.
[00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:22.000]   So it's, it's, it doesn't do as much, doesn't feel as much like a mini iPad.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.440]   And I think what people want is to go back to that feeling like you have a tiny
[00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:25.440]   tablet in your hand.
[00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:26.440]   Yeah.
[00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:29.600]   And of course it would cannibalize that probably iPad sales, which have been coming coming
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:31.000]   back.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.120]   But I would love a six and a half inch iPhone.
[00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:35.120]   Bring it on.
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:38.560]   I don't think Apple is, I don't think Apple's precious about the iPad mini is a product that
[00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:41.720]   they had to be convinced to make to begin with.
[00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:45.360]   I think they, I think they really want to try to get some of those Galaxy Note sales back.
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:49.800]   Now that now that the Samsung has a model that doesn't ignite, I think that they realize
[00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:53.320]   that that bites into their, that's biting into the purchase, that there's a, that there
[00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:59.920]   is a niche for people who have need for a high, a larger productivity minded phone.
[00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:04.560]   I don't think they'll go so far as to make it work with Apple pencil, though, when that
[00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:05.560]   be interesting.
[00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:07.200]   But I think that's where they're going to go.
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:08.200]   Yeah.
[00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:09.200]   Well, it'd have to be a smaller pencil, right?
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:10.200]   A little stylist.
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:12.200]   You don't have to go to the top pencil.
[00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:15.640]   I'm going to kick this around with the phone.
[00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:16.640]   It's too big.
[00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:17.640]   It's not the sketch.
[00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:18.640]   The Apple pencil sketch.
[00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:19.640]   Sketch.
[00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:20.640]   I like it.
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:21.640]   I like it.
[00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:22.640]   And that's one of three.
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:26.480]   So there's this six and a half inch, largest iPhone ever.
[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:30.480]   It actually would be bigger than a Galaxy Note even.
[00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:35.400]   Then a say, an upgraded size, a hands at the size of the current iPhone 10.
[00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:38.720]   And then a replacement for the SE, which is admittedly getting a little long in the
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:43.880]   tooth, a less expensive model with some of the flagship phone's key features.
[00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:45.880]   All three would have Face ID, for instance.
[00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:49.320]   There is an S, there is an SE replacement, which is not this phone.
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:52.880]   This phone is designed for people who want a less expensive.
[00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:56.200]   It's almost like the iPhone 5C strategy, but instead of going for pop art, they're keeping
[00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:59.040]   the same characteristics of an iPhone 10.
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:03.080]   But there's a limit to how much OLED that Apple can actually consume in any given cycle.
[00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:06.520]   And also to the price that you can charge for those sort of premium, because all that
[00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:08.280]   is still a super expensive technology.
[00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:12.040]   So by making an iPhone 10 that has an LCD screen, for example, and doesn't have every
[00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:15.400]   one of the brand new bells and whistles, you'll reduce the price.
[00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:19.280]   I think one of the challenges they have now is the iPhone 6S, iPhone 7, iPhone 8, and
[00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:20.280]   the 8 are all on the market.
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:23.920]   They all look identical and there's very little differentiation for the iPhone 8.
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:28.360]   But if you get one of those into the new form factor, then you have a lower cost option.
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:31.440]   And I think that'll promote a lot more upgrades than it would if they just kept around the
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:32.640]   8th for another year.
[00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:33.640]   Okay.
[00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:34.640]   Yeah.
[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:39.280]   Well, it's also going to be keen to see, remember that I was surprised last year to see exactly
[00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:42.840]   how big the iPhone line is right now.
[00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:46.880]   They didn't really clear any of the wheat away from the field as they brought in these
[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:47.880]   new models.
[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:51.960]   So my guess has always been that they wanted to, they did the math and figure out that
[00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:56.800]   it was cheap enough to keep, given component costs that they already have on hand, given
[00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:00.960]   the stuff that they already have, it might be okay to simply keep the line as thick as
[00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:01.960]   possible.
[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:06.240]   And then that will tell them what phone do they need to make that they're not making
[00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:11.600]   already as a new product and or what can we, what do we not dare cancel?
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:16.400]   So I wonder if we're going to be back to a three or four iPhone lineup because when
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:21.160]   you have the idea of having so many annual phones still on the price list, you've got
[00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:24.640]   to wonder why that why that's so and how long it's going to last.
[00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:27.680]   I think the SE, I mean, some people who buy the SE, some people just wanted an expensive
[00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:31.400]   iPhone, but some people still really want that very small one handed iPhone.
[00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:35.240]   And the next generation of that sounds more like what an iPhone six or seven or eight
[00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:36.920]   size device, but with a full screen.
[00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:41.000]   So you sort of, you sort of, well, maybe an iPhone SE thing, but what a full size screen.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.360]   So you get that 4.7 inch screen, but in that small form factor.
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:51.320]   So Mark is repeating the, you know, rumor that we've, we've, we've said, well, that
[00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:55.960]   may not be true that the iPhone 10 hasn't sold all that well.
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:21:03.040]   He's, he's saying Apple sold 77.3 million iPhones in the final quarter of 2017.
[00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:04.960]   Analysts projected 80 million.
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:11.520]   So that's off by almost 3 million, not a huge difference, a million a month.
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:12.520]   Is that now credible?
[00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:14.920]   Now that Mark saying it?
[00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:15.920]   It's hard.
[00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:18.240]   I mean, it's hard, but they're, they're also more expensive than Apple's making much more
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:19.320]   profit off each one.
[00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:22.080]   So it's, I find that kind of stuff hard to tell.
[00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:23.560]   We'll eventually get numbers on it.
[00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:26.240]   I don't think it matters if they're within a few percentage points.
[00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:27.240]   Yeah, that's awfully close.
[00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:28.240]   Yeah.
[00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:29.240]   Yeah.
[00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:30.240]   Exactly.
[00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:33.120]   And it's like, is that the fact that they created a brand new product and they sold gangbusters
[00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:35.880]   of them just fewer than analysts thought they would.
[00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:37.080]   How big is that problem?
[00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:39.080]   I don't think it's very, very big.
[00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:41.880]   They were sitting on shelves and they sold half.
[00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:46.600]   But it might be a signal, so it's like, it's, it's, it's, it's different when you have
[00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:51.920]   introduced a new phone and then all of a sudden the price drops from $650 to $500.
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:54.240]   And then there's a special deal somewhere you get $500.
[00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:55.240]   Yeah.
[00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:56.240]   Exactly.
[00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:57.240]   That's what, that's when you start to worry.
[00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:58.440]   I don't think we're in that kind of situation.
[00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:02.520]   It might be a signal though from consumers that Apple pushed price too far.
[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:07.840]   It's interesting because Samsung just announced it's S9 and S9+, and while that might have
[00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:13.120]   been an opportunity for Samsung to reach Apple price levels, they didn't.
[00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:17.760]   They went with 720 bucks for the 9 and 840 bucks for the plus.
[00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:21.560]   So still significantly below the iPhone 10 selling price.
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:24.960]   Actually, the marketing thing, it's like you want to, you want to sell it for the most
[00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:27.960]   you can without losing too many customers that you're making less money if you sold it for
[00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:28.960]   it.
[00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:32.560]   So if Apple calculates that, they'll sell 3% less, but they'll make 20% more money.
[00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:33.560]   That's a good deal for them.
[00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:37.160]   If Samsung calculated that if they increase the price, they'd sell 50% less.
[00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:38.160]   That's not a good deal for them.
[00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:39.800]   So it's always on a model by model basis.
[00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:40.800]   Yeah.
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:43.840]   And with Samsung, they also have two other variables in there.
[00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:47.480]   Number one, they already have a $1,000 phone that they don't necessarily want to cannibalize.
[00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:52.600]   So if you're basically now charging $950 for a standard phone that doesn't have a stylist,
[00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:56.640]   doesn't have some of the features that the note has, that's a problem for them.
[00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:59.840]   But then you also have the problem where Apple can command that kind of price because they're
[00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:05.560]   putting technologies in there that really set it apart and make it feel special.
[00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:11.080]   I think that Samsung would have 3D face detection if they had the engineering and the manufacturing
[00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:13.840]   in order to actually put that in the phone this year.
[00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:18.320]   They don't shy away from putting in an incomplete, not quite finished product that at least
[00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:19.440]   demos well.
[00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:22.560]   So I think that it's significant that they have not made that move.
[00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:27.200]   So if they were to put these next generation pieces of hardware inside that phone, that
[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:29.080]   would sort of enable them to kick up the price a little bit.
[00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:33.640]   I think right now, all these factors, including the fact that they're responding to the iPhone
[00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:38.920]   10 means that it's very much in their best interest to keep the prices down for now.
[00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:41.200]   Mark, is this horrible tweet from a former Samsung?
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:43.040]   I guess an embittered former Samsung employees.
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:44.040]   Oh, great.
[00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:45.520]   Samsung finally went up the iPhone 8.
[00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:50.960]   And I just, although Samsung at that event on Sunday and we covered it, we streamed it.
[00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:51.960]   You can watch it.
[00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:56.080]   Our Android Live specials, Father Robert Balisera and Ron Richards from all about Android.
[00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:59.280]   Apple got a few jabs from Samsung.
[00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:05.800]   They mentioned No-notch, they mentioned headphone jack, they mentioned and we've kept the fingerprint
[00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:08.280]   reader, but we still have face recognition.
[00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:12.160]   They did also attempt to duplicate Apple's Animojis.
[00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:13.160]   I'm not sure why.
[00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:14.920]   And they didn't do it as well.
[00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:19.360]   Apple had an emoji that was, I never saw it, but I heard about it.
[00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:20.360]   That was very similar to that.
[00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:22.640]   And they didn't ship it because they considered it too creepy.
[00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:26.160]   It's a new, it's basically you.
[00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:30.200]   So you take a picture of yourself and then it turns it into like a bitmoji, it turns it
[00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:32.200]   into the kind of one.
[00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:35.560]   Yes, if you wonder us, if Snap never really trademarked Bitmoji, because they would have
[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:36.880]   done great with this.
[00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:37.880]   Yeah.
[00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:43.320]   Well, frankly, whatever Apple does with Animojis or Samsung does, Snap's been doing it for
[00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:45.320]   a long time anyway.
[00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:46.960]   So it's not.
[00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:51.360]   And people have played with the Samsung version, say it's not as responsive as the Apple Animojis.
[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:52.360]   I couldn't care less.
[00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:55.840]   I used Animojis a lot for a day and I used them since.
[00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:59.440]   It was interesting technologically that Samsung didn't put the fingerprint reader underneath
[00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:01.360]   the screen because we've heard about so much.
[00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:05.040]   And operating at Apple or Samsung scale is very different than operating at small-batch
[00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:06.640]   phone manufacturers scale.
[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:09.040]   But they didn't get the same fingerprint scanner underneath the glass.
[00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:10.640]   They did move it, which was great.
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:15.280]   And they did finally allow you to have both iris and facial scanning at the same time,
[00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:16.640]   which is great.
[00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:20.360]   But it seemed like this is what Apple gets blasted for and it used to get blasted for
[00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:23.920]   in the quote unquote S years where they sort of fixed up what they got wrong the first
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:24.920]   time.
[00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:25.920]   And it's not phone and people will like it.
[00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:26.920]   I'm going to order it.
[00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:27.920]   It looks pretty good.
[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:30.720]   And the camera, they're going straight at Apple with the camera.
[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:33.000]   F1.5, F2 points.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.400]   How do they do that?
[00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:36.920]   Because HTC tried and they couldn't get rid of the distortion.
[00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:39.560]   So I'm super curious to see what Samsung can do at 1.5.
[00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:45.760]   It may be just that soft, you know, all phone, all cameras, even our high-end Sony Alpha
[00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:49.720]   cameras have distortion and errors in the sensors.
[00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:51.520]   They're corrected in software.
[00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:56.320]   So it may just be they got good enough to correct any distortions in the lens.
[00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:59.520]   Apparently one lens has both apertures available to it.
[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:01.320]   Yeah, it's like a mechanical switch, right?
[00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:02.520]   You see it moving.
[00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:03.520]   Yeah.
[00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:10.800]   That's super interesting because the easiest way to get more light into a picture is to
[00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:12.520]   put more light into the sensor.
[00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:16.000]   So you would want a smaller f-stop.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.720]   But there's also what if you're in an actual sunny day, then that becomes a problem because
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:25.080]   you get more artifacts, more problems with the smaller sensor, excuse me, but the smaller
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:26.080]   aperture.
[00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:27.400]   So I hope this works out.
[00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:30.840]   I hope we see how well this works because if it works, you know that Apple is going to
[00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:33.920]   be looking more hard at that in the next year or next too.
[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:37.600]   Dual lenses, just like the Note 8 portrait mode, just like Apple.
[00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:40.800]   You know, it looks like a good camera.
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:42.480]   I'll be very interested to play with it.
[00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:45.000]   I'll be getting it in a couple of weeks and I'll let you know.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.920]   I'm not as a mess in this, but what Andy said earlier, I'm getting the feeling that
[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:49.600]   the Note is more of the flagship phone now.
[00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:54.360]   As a higher price point, it has more features and that sort of makes it okay that I think
[00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:58.720]   this doesn't reach as far as the Note 8 or at least the Note is going to come in quasi-eclipse
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:00.320]   this come the fall.
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:03.760]   Yeah, particularly, again, 3D face scanning.
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:08.800]   It just opens up so much stuff, so much stuff that kind of works if you don't have 3D scanning
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:11.880]   works if you have 3D scanning.
[00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:15.800]   And it's not just the case of being able to source as many components.
[00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:19.920]   It's also having actual physical room on the device.
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:24.480]   I will never stop joking about how, oh well, once again, it turns out that Samsung had
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:28.760]   room for IP68 and a headphone jack and all the other cool stuff they wanted to put in
[00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:29.760]   there.
[00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:35.360]   But I also don't see in this new model where they would have had room to put in the sacrifice
[00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:38.240]   for the extra sensors and the extra readers to do it right.
[00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:39.240]   I'm not.
[00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:42.040]   They could have added a notch, Andy.
[00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:45.200]   I was looking hard at the 9.
[00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:49.240]   I know it doesn't have a notch, but I don't miss it.
[00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:50.880]   It has to be.
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:54.080]   It's funny we've come around saying do you miss the notch?
[00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:56.280]   Well, no, I'm saying that.
[00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:58.480]   Well, Andy, you see he is going to support it, right?
[00:27:58.480 --> 00:27:59.480]   Yes.
[00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:03.840]   But we've seen other phones where they've tried to do edge to edge by saying, well, what if
[00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:08.000]   we actually just put a circle of nothingness near the top of the screen, but we let it
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   go to the edge?
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   And that's interesting.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.680]   Having a iPhone.
[00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:15.480]   Oh God, that's not that is weird as hell.
[00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:17.240]   Who's doing that?
[00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:18.720]   Is there an edge to edge camera?
[00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:21.600]   But in order to take a selfie, you have to pop up a little pop up camera.
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:23.160]   That would be weird.
[00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:24.160]   Nobody's doing that, right?
[00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:25.160]   You just made that up.
[00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:26.160]   Yeah, that was a concept.
[00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:27.480]   There was a concept phone at NWC.
[00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:28.480]   Interesting.
[00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:29.480]   Yeah.
[00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:33.320]   But also the essential phone had this idea of saying what if we have a much, much better
[00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:36.360]   sensor that clicks on magnetically under pogo pins.
[00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:38.400]   And that's an interesting idea.
[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:43.160]   But I don't think that anybody who's buying anybody who's buying a modern phone at regular
[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:48.360]   premium prices, I don't think they're bothered by image quality to that extent anymore.
[00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:54.640]   They would spend an extra $125 to $200 for a better, attachable camera and be remembered
[00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:58.640]   to put this camera in their pocket when they go out for the course of the day.
[00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:03.360]   Not Steven Sonneberg, at least he's just shooting with iPhones now.
[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:04.360]   Yeah.
[00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:05.360]   Yeah.
[00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:11.200]   I guess, well, wait and see, but I'm looking forward to trying the camera.
[00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:16.120]   I think one of the things that's happening that's interesting, Android's been, it feels
[00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:21.080]   like the Apple can hit laps Android that Andrew and caps up and then Apple laps Android
[00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:22.840]   and that Android catches up.
[00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:29.080]   And it feels like one of the reasons that Samsung might want this note eight S nine note
[00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:33.760]   nine kind of stagger step is to give it a chance to see what I'm sure they're not saying
[00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:34.760]   this.
[00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:36.000]   And then Apple does.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.960]   And then, okay, well, we only have six months to the next phone.
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:42.560]   We can kind of get there quickly.
[00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:44.840]   Everybody's watching everybody else.
[00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:45.840]   Apple's watching.
[00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:47.520]   It's not just, it's not copying.
[00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:52.360]   It's more like you can't, you can write a play, you can rehearse a play, you can do all
[00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:55.280]   this sort of stuff when you're writing a play, you don't know what you have until you put
[00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:57.880]   up front of an audience to see how the audience reacts to it.
[00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:02.480]   So the reaction in the field to this, any new features that Apple puts in the next phone
[00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:05.760]   is going to be carefully monitored, not just by Apple, but by everybody else.
[00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:11.480]   So that's why I kind of like the idea of, I will again, continuously joke about how Samsung
[00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:14.480]   doesn't hesitate about putting out a feature that's not really quite there yet.
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:15.760]   Just have a good demo.
[00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:19.720]   But nonetheless, you just look at how people react to that or people buying more phones
[00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:23.480]   and are they being affected when you do all that market research about what made you go
[00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:25.880]   for the Samsung Galaxy Omega.
[00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:30.520]   And they say, well, the thing is, I really like the idea of that PICO projector that's
[00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:35.800]   actually also part of a camera so you can project things onto your dog while it's moving.
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:39.880]   And yes, it does at work, but okay, let's work on PICO projection technology for the
[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:40.880]   next one.
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:41.880]   Apple.
[00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:44.760]   One thing that still endures me about Samsung though is they have the event, the event is
[00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:45.760]   starting.
[00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:48.400]   I'm about to watch the live stream and then the embargo lifts and suddenly all these
[00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:49.400]   videos go up there.
[00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:50.840]   I don't know where to look anymore.
[00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:54.240]   And then they're just, they're so excited but so awkward.
[00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:57.400]   And then they put, they say, hold up your badge, put your phone in front of it and now
[00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:59.520]   everyone's hands are full and then they're waiting for them to clap.
[00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:01.160]   And you're like, no, just calm down.
[00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:02.560]   That was pretty funny, wasn't it?
[00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:03.560]   You knew.
[00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:04.560]   I was listening.
[00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:07.320]   We did the stream, but I was listening to the stream because I was driving somewhere.
[00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:11.280]   And you knew that the reason there wasn't clapping is because people were going, I have the
[00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:13.040]   phone in my hand, I have my badge in my hand.
[00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:14.040]   What am I going to?
[00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:15.280]   And the guy on stage is going, right?
[00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:16.280]   Right?
[00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:17.280]   Right?
[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:20.280]   But that, but I did want to applaud because that was really cool.
[00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:21.280]   That was really cool.
[00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:22.280]   That was really cool.
[00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:26.800]   You held up your badge, you shot the picture with with any Android phone.
[00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:30.320]   I presume, and maybe even an iPhone, if you had the Samsung app on there and you would
[00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:35.520]   get an augmented reality in your hand of the Samsung Galaxy S9 so you could turn it over.
[00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:36.760]   You could see the front and back.
[00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:37.760]   That's clever.
[00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:38.760]   Very clever.
[00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:39.760]   Oh, and the color is handy.
[00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:40.760]   We got, there's purple.
[00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:41.760]   I ordered the orchid.
[00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:42.760]   I believe it's not.
[00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:43.760]   Orchid.
[00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:44.760]   Sorry.
[00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:45.760]   It's not lilac.
[00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:49.200]   I think they called it orchid, but I'm not sure.
[00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:52.640]   So Apple's next generation, of course, will be the A12.
[00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:53.640]   Let's see.
[00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:54.640]   They did bionic.
[00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:57.240]   It's a version, zippity doo-dah.
[00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:59.240]   I don't know what they're going to call it.
[00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:00.240]   It's just branding.
[00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:01.240]   That really is.
[00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:04.200]   They have a bunch of people in a room and they thought I think of a cool word.
[00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:10.560]   But benchmarks are starting to come out of the 845 new Qualcomm chip and then Samsung
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:15.160]   has its own Exynos chip in the international version of the S9, the 9810.
[00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:20.760]   Interesting benchmarks from a non-tech understanding, of course, that these were based on the,
[00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:22.840]   you know, whatever that pre-production phone was.
[00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:25.840]   They were able to get their hands on at the MWC.
[00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:27.640]   But not great results.
[00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:34.640]   And if you really look at the benchmarks consistently across the board, Apple's way ahead of the
[00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:35.640]   competition.
[00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:38.240]   Monsoon is the A11.
[00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:39.240]   That's on top.
[00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:40.640]   I think Sasha Sagan explains this really well.
[00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:43.720]   I think people assume that Samsung phones are going to use Samsung chips, but they're
[00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:45.400]   actually completely separate companies.
[00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:47.360]   They just both licensed the Samsung name.
[00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:50.920]   In the US because of CBMA licensing, they have to use the Qualcomm chips.
[00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:54.440]   I mean, they could use Qualcomm modems the way Apple does, but it doesn't matter to them
[00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:55.440]   as much.
[00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:58.560]   But I think it would be great if they, I mean Huawei and one of the Chinese companies
[00:32:58.560 --> 00:32:59.680]   is doing their own silicon now too.
[00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:02.840]   I just think it'd be such a great world of Samsung was super serious on integrating
[00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:04.160]   silicon as well.
[00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:08.600]   I will, you know, we don't, I don't see 845 benchmarks yet, but we'll look at those.
[00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:14.400]   But my guess is this performance of the iPhone in almost, as far as I could tell, every single
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:17.160]   benchmark is significantly ahead.
[00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:18.960]   The light blue is the S9.
[00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:19.960]   Yeah, single.
[00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:24.880]   And that's what Apple optimized for, single thread as they should because in most cases,
[00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:25.880]   that's what's going on here.
[00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:27.480]   And the UI is the responsiveness.
[00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:30.200]   That's what gives them that really tactile feeling.
[00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:37.160]   Here's a couple of benchmarks where the 845 is fast, but these are not compared to Apple
[00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:39.360]   because for some reason there's no Apple results in there.
[00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:43.800]   I guess these particular benchmarks don't work on iOS.
[00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:53.040]   And everyone that iOS is part of Qualcomm and Samsung are significantly farther behind yellow.
[00:33:53.040 --> 00:34:00.600]   I mean, orange bar is Qualcomm's 845 and the blue bar is the S9 with the new X and
[00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:03.000]   S chip and there's no color for the Apple bar.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:04.200]   It's just the one on the top.
[00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:08.120]   It's just, it's just, it's just the one at the top.
[00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:09.120]   That's all.
[00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:11.800]   That's from a company that 10 years ago wasn't making silicon.
[00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:12.800]   Pretty impressive.
[00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:17.840]   I got to say, now they're all based on ARM designs, but it's not, you know, the design.
[00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:19.400]   It's how you implement it.
[00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:20.400]   It makes sense.
[00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:21.400]   Apple went wide and slow.
[00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:22.400]   Yeah.
[00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:23.400]   Wide and slow.
[00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:24.400]   Yeah.
[00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:25.760]   Bunchmarks aren't terribly impressive.
[00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:27.720]   It's what it does with that processing power.
[00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:34.920]   And every spot in the iPhone experience, you see features that you're not going to get
[00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:38.480]   the benefit of the CPU by looking at a higher number on a benchmark.
[00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:41.400]   You're going to get it by how quickly you can take HDR photos.
[00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:47.880]   You're going to get it by how rarely it's stumped by a really badly coded web page that because
[00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:51.960]   it can actually, it can actually sort of navigate its way around loopy code.
[00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:57.680]   This is Samsung has really nice CPUs, but they don't do much with them.
[00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:00.120]   That is very much user facing.
[00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:01.120]   Yeah.
[00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:03.120]   Pixel phone is different.
[00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:08.640]   According to Apple, german Apple is considering a gold color option for the updated iPhone
[00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:11.080]   10 and the larger model.
[00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:13.400]   They can China Leo and big phone's are they in China.
[00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:14.720]   Big gold phone will be huge.
[00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:20.200]   They couldn't, according to german, they couldn't do gold for the current iPhone 10.
[00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:21.200]   And so good.
[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:22.200]   I don't think that's technical.
[00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:26.440]   I think that's just in order to get enough of every phone that you need to scale.
[00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:28.280]   And this phone was not designed to stand.
[00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:32.080]   And you need something to get people to buy a new phone.
[00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:37.200]   And we've said, we told you for the last few weeks, Leo, it worked well last time.
[00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:38.200]   Just make it gold.
[00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:40.080]   And that's, well, I have to have the gold rose gold.
[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:41.080]   Remember, I have to have it.
[00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:42.080]   Yeah.
[00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:43.080]   Yeah.
[00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:44.080]   Violet gold.
[00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:45.080]   I'm not even joking.
[00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:47.880]   I wish that there were that were an annual finger in March.
[00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:51.720]   You will see the same phone that was that was released in September, but it will be a
[00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:53.840]   new vibrant color for spring.
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:57.240]   You'll get all the people who are on the fence and maybe they didn't buy.
[00:35:57.240 --> 00:35:58.240]   They didn't.
[00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:00.800]   They weren't really seduced by the, oh my God, the new phone.
[00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:01.800]   Oh, I got to get the new phone.
[00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:03.040]   Oh, my friends have a new phone.
[00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:06.680]   And then, you know, the hooks sort of removed from your from your heart.
[00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:09.360]   And now you find that you're still doing fine with your iPhone six.
[00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:13.240]   But as soon as you mean, there's a purple version of the iPhone 10.
[00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:14.240]   Catching.
[00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:20.840]   German points out, of course, that Apple's plans could change, but they make prototypes.
[00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:24.720]   And these are based on prototypes that they may or may not end up making.
[00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:29.120]   He says in some regions, Apple's considering off our dual SIM, which is something they've
[00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:31.520]   never offered, but everybody else does.
[00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:37.480]   And if you're in Asia or a lot of places, people move around in Europe from country to
[00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:40.960]   country, they would like more Sims.
[00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:43.000]   Let's see what else updated operating system.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:50.600]   I press possibly iOS 12 code name piece, including an upgraded augmented reality capabilities,
[00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:53.760]   deeper integration of Siri digital health monitoring.
[00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:56.960]   And finally, the ability to use an emojis in FaceTime.
[00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:58.960]   We've talked about that before.
[00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:03.000]   So no new home screen for you, but you can use an emoji in FaceTime.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:10.440]   LCD on the less expensive phone, the top two would be continuing to use OLED.
[00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:14.360]   Aluminum edges on the less expensive phone, staying on the top two.
[00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:18.320]   Last backs on all three.
[00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:19.960]   Not flashier stainless steel.
[00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:21.640]   Is this a stainless steel back?
[00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:24.240]   No, he's talking about the edge.
[00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:25.240]   It's hard.
[00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:27.800]   I mean, Qualcomm has technology to do inductive charging through metal, but I don't think
[00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:29.760]   I've seen ever seen anybody.
[00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:35.560]   I am so funny how Apple, of course, made wireless now the thing again.
[00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:36.640]   They invented it last year.
[00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:38.080]   They invented it last year.
[00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:39.080]   Thank you, Apple.
[00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:41.320]   Oh, that's me.
[00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:42.320]   Sorry.
[00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:44.080]   I'm trying to take the case off my phone.
[00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:45.960]   I started playing a reggae.
[00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:48.960]   Don't mess with me, man.
[00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:51.560]   Didn't know that was a feature of iOS 11.
[00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:55.960]   Yeah, you please both sides and it starts playing Bunny Whaler.
[00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:56.960]   Call 911.
[00:37:56.960 --> 00:38:01.280]   I'm going to place you something soothing while you waste the MPs.
[00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:07.840]   Okay, I think that's the entire german rumor for that one.
[00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:11.760]   Although there was an earlier rumor that Apple is planning to also release an upgraded
[00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:13.560]   air pod.
[00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:14.880]   Come on.
[00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:18.360]   What will be new in the air pods?
[00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:19.360]   Water resistance.
[00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:20.360]   Water resistance.
[00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:21.360]   A series better.
[00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:22.360]   Sorry.
[00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:23.360]   Your slow mo.
[00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:24.360]   Touchless Siri.
[00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:25.360]   Yeah.
[00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:26.360]   Yeah.
[00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:27.360]   Slow motion.
[00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:34.480]   By the way, I do have to say Samsung announced 960 frame per second slow mo audio on that
[00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:36.280]   new video.
[00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:40.240]   That's a selling point by itself.
[00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:41.880]   Apple tops it 240, right?
[00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:43.040]   Yeah, although it's continuous.
[00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:46.760]   I think Samsung's catching 0.2 seconds, but I still want those 0.2.
[00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:51.920]   Well they say they can do it because they put memory and DRAM into the sensor on the
[00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:52.920]   camera.
[00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:54.720]   So that's great.
[00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:58.400]   So it's Samsung's biggest problem is that they still have no idea what silicon is underneath
[00:38:58.400 --> 00:38:59.400]   everything else that they do.
[00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:00.400]   They don't know.
[00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:03.520]   It's either Qualcomm or Exynos, which means they can't specifically target an Apple can
[00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:06.800]   make an image signal processor because it knows it's Apple silicon.
[00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:07.880]   It's going to hit over and over again.
[00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:10.600]   So Samsung has to do its best to sort of abstract that away.
[00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:12.720]   We saw Google doing that with the Pixel core.
[00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:14.840]   I know the pixel is it called the Pixel core or something like that?
[00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:15.840]   The visual core image.
[00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:16.840]   Yeah.
[00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:17.840]   Yeah.
[00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:18.840]   Image core something like that.
[00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:21.060]   And now Samsung is putting DRAM out of the thing because it just doesn't have its own
[00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:22.060]   consistent silicon to hit.
[00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:23.360]   So I think it's great that they're doing it.
[00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:26.160]   I just wish they would do their own silicon.
[00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:27.160]   Air pods are produced.
[00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:30.360]   I've not noticed by the same people that do the home pods.
[00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:32.920]   So maybe the new AirPods will leave a ring on your furniture.
[00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:33.920]   I don't know.
[00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:34.920]   We know if these don't.
[00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:35.920]   Does anyone test it?
[00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:36.920]   I don't know.
[00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:40.640]   Well, they'll be a W2 chip.
[00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:41.640]   I'm scanning through this.
[00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:44.920]   The W2 chip is in the Apple Watch series three.
[00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:51.160]   So I don't know if they would call this Apple Watch W1P or if you call it W3 or.
[00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:57.480]   You know, I think it's early to do new AirPods if they were to put them out in this first
[00:39:57.480 --> 00:39:58.480]   half of the year.
[00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:01.880]   But at the same time, they're selling like, you know, hotcakes.
[00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:02.880]   They can't fast.
[00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:06.080]   And I think people really want like especially runners who like either sweat a lot or run
[00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:07.720]   in the rain really want the water.
[00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:08.720]   Water is just in speech.
[00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:09.720]   Yeah.
[00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:10.720]   High demand.
[00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:11.720]   Yes.
[00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:12.720]   That's where they're failing at this point.
[00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:13.720]   Yeah.
[00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:15.960]   Also, also, I think they're going to want to try to figure out how to keep them a little
[00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:20.160]   bit cleaner because that's where people who now are using them daily for like nine, 10,
[00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:22.520]   11 months, that's where they're saying now.
[00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:23.520]   I don't know.
[00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:26.280]   I don't know why this these sounds so much worse.
[00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:28.560]   And then they read online.
[00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:32.880]   If you give a little bit of mouth to mouth to your ear pods, you will actually suck up
[00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:36.040]   some of the crud that's been sucked in there and then we'll thank you.
[00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:37.040]   Kind of win-checked wipers.
[00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:38.040]   Yeah.
[00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:39.040]   Exactly.
[00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:41.000]   Apple, it says this is interesting.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.960]   CNBC found this tidbit in Apple's security guide, the iOS security guide, which Apple
[00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:48.080]   puts out every year or so.
[00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:54.560]   In past years, the security guide kind of hinted that they were using Amazon Web Services
[00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:57.760]   in Azure for iCloud storage.
[00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:05.720]   This most recent security guide says it's Google's cloud replacing Amazon and Microsoft.
[00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:06.720]   I couldn't get excited.
[00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:10.680]   I mean, as far as I understand, Apple just does this the way they all tie one semiconductor
[00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:13.560]   is going to make the A9 and then Samsung's going to make the A10.
[00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:14.560]   They take competitive bids.
[00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:17.000]   They try to get the best rates and they try to get the best storage that they can.
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:22.040]   If that is Google one year and Amazon, the next Microsoft, they'll go if someone makes
[00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:23.040]   them a better deal.
[00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:24.040]   Yeah.
[00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:27.720]   I'm sure it's absolutely bidding in competition because who wouldn't want it?
[00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:31.160]   Google's coming on hard because Google has not traditionally been in those conversations.
[00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:35.120]   A lot of them are still about Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services and Google is competing
[00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:36.120]   hard for that.
[00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:37.680]   So if they may not be able to deal with it, go ahead.
[00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:41.600]   We should probably mention at this point, Google Cloud Services and Amazon Web Services
[00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:46.840]   are both advertisers from time to time on our network.
[00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:49.160]   I use all of them myself.
[00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:56.160]   This is why this sort of sports team mentality is just so useless when you're trying to say,
[00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:57.160]   "Oh, well, Apple is the top.
[00:41:57.160 --> 00:41:59.040]   Is everything with Samsung is the best at this?"
[00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:00.040]   So yeah, you know what?
[00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:03.800]   Apple always for every component, they make the best decision they can possibly make for
[00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:05.400]   this product and for its users.
[00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:08.680]   So it is going to be chips from a whole bunch of different manufacturers.
[00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:12.600]   And when they decide to do their own silicon, it's not because that they are thumbing their
[00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:17.640]   nose at Qualcomm or somebody else, it's because they see an opportunity that they are leaving
[00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:21.640]   on the table because they don't control that part of the experience.
[00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:24.680]   And but it certainly is a good indication for Google.
[00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:31.040]   They really are, they are rowing the dice very, very hard on being the infrastructure that
[00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:34.840]   every other company wants to rely on to power all of their services.
[00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:40.200]   So when you see Google, you see the numbers, Facebook is not in trouble, but you see some
[00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:44.400]   troubling early signs of how people are disengaging from Facebook.
[00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:49.200]   And given that right now, people only interact with Facebook through an app that gives them
[00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:51.520]   access to a social network long term.
[00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:52.920]   That's a problem for Facebook.
[00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:57.720]   Whereas Google when they have their engagement is up because they are people are engaging
[00:42:57.720 --> 00:43:01.400]   in all kinds of different Google services that patch into everything else, what everything
[00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:02.400]   else there is.
[00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:07.080]   And they're also making sure that in the future cloud services are going to be a competitive
[00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:12.840]   thing that Google offers, machine learning services are again, another thing that offered
[00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:14.560]   competitively by Google.
[00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:19.600]   They're working so hard on making sure that the entire world, when they are running AI
[00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:23.920]   and machine learning models, they are using Google services in order to create that.
[00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:29.080]   So this is what this is why Google is probably going to be alongside Apple in the next five
[00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:34.200]   years and a lot of other companies, even Facebook, could suddenly be holding on to a lot of
[00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:38.200]   valuable personal information and they're in a position where they need to start paying
[00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:39.760]   off dividends for people.
[00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:44.960]   And they start looking at, you know what, our users did click through an agreement that
[00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:48.520]   says that we could sell whatever we want for whatever reason.
[00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:50.160]   We just never thought we'd be that desperate.
[00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:53.000]   So that's another thing in Google and Facebook.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:59.920]   >> Should also, by the way, thanks to Scooter X who passed along the actual germane text
[00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:03.360]   from Apple's iOS security guide.
[00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:09.680]   Each file is broken into chunks and encrypted by iCloud using AES 128-bit encryption and
[00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:14.760]   a key derived from each chunk's contents that uses SHA-256.
[00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:18.680]   The keys and data stored by Apple and the user's iCloud account, the encrypted chunks
[00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:23.600]   of the file are stored without any user identifying information, including using third-party
[00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:29.120]   storage services like S3, Amazon service and Google Cloud Platform.
[00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:31.600]   So it doesn't mean they're not using Azure anymore.
[00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:37.560]   But maybe it does, but they are certainly using Amazon and Google and it doesn't matter.
[00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:44.560]   Now, interesting point here, the keys to all of this are held by Apple and if you're
[00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:51.560]   in China, you might want to know that as of the end of the month, Apple will move the iCloud
[00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:55.360]   keys to the Chinese servers, not starting next week.
[00:44:55.360 --> 00:45:00.280]   >> Yeah, next week by the end of the month is tomorrow.
[00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:07.440]   So a couple of things to raising human rights fears, it's, I guess, the case.
[00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:14.440]   In the past, Chinese authorities had a service, subpoena on Apple in the US to get that information.
[00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:20.840]   But Apple did give it to them, but they had to go through the US courts.
[00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:24.080]   Now they'll just do it, whatever the rules are in China.
[00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:27.480]   And I am told that it's often done without warrant or subpoena.
[00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:28.480]   >> Exactly.
[00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:29.480]   It's really an open door thing.
[00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:36.440]   That this is a government that if you say things that are unpopular, you're under arrest.
[00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:41.920]   That's not as bad as the situation in Turkey or even Russia, but it is a situation where
[00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:44.760]   they don't like people saying things that are unpopular.
[00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:49.000]   And they have all kinds of tools to smack you back down if you do.
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:50.960]   They've locked up journalists.
[00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:51.960]   It's a bet.
[00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:56.480]   I have to say that I don't see that Apple had any real choice in the matter, as Tim Cook
[00:45:56.480 --> 00:46:02.400]   often says that our policy is to submit to whatever the local laws in the region that
[00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:04.080]   we're operating in.
[00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:11.480]   And many human rights organizations agree that if a company like Apple, hypothetically
[00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:16.280]   in this situation, they can do more good for the people of China by staying in there and
[00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:20.680]   giving them communication services than they would by simply pulling out because of this
[00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:21.680]   one thing.
[00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:27.120]   However, my only disappointment here is that I really does underscore that Apple's biggest
[00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:33.920]   face, Tim really has to start balancing all of these signs.
[00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:38.480]   All of these would seem to be concessions towards China and wanting to look good to the
[00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:43.240]   Chinese government with statements that there are limits to how far we're going to go, that
[00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:48.200]   we think that privacy and security are important things for everybody, not just when it becomes
[00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:54.520]   inconvenient for us, they should mention that it becomes a problem when governments try
[00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:57.720]   to weaponize the phones in people's pockets.
[00:46:57.720 --> 00:47:02.840]   So it's going to be the longer that Apple puts off having a really good policy statement
[00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:06.240]   about that, the weaker their position is going to be.
[00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:10.760]   Apple and Google and Facebook, these companies, they have the power of nation states and they
[00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:14.600]   really are going to have to have their own state department really to make sure that they
[00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:15.960]   know that we have power.
[00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:18.400]   Not going to just simply let anybody use that power.
[00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:21.000]   You can't count on us to do the certain sort of thing.
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:24.040]   We will use that power tactically and strategically when we have to.
[00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:28.640]   So Apple says, while we advocated against iCloud being subject to these laws, we were
[00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:31.800]   ultimately unsuccessful.
[00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:36.640]   They decided it was better to offer iCloud under the new system in China because discontinuing
[00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:41.320]   it would they do a bad user experience and actually lead to less data privacy and security
[00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:42.320]   for its Chinese.
[00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:43.320]   I mean, there's a lot.
[00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:46.120]   I did a whole 15 minute video on this yesterday.
[00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:49.200]   So there's a lot of impact, but the short version is there's several issues involved
[00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:50.200]   here.
[00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:53.720]   One is that iCloud absolutely has security and privacy components, but it also has data
[00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:55.160]   retention components.
[00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:58.000]   And for a lot of people, that's incredibly important that you know that the photos that
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:47:59.520]   you're taking are backed up.
[00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:02.520]   The thesis that you're writing is backed up that your personal notes, all of those things,
[00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:06.320]   if you lose or break or destroy your phone, you just get a new phone and that all comes
[00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:10.400]   back down and removing that ability from people is a direct hit to the functionality of that
[00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:11.400]   phone.
[00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:14.760]   It's unclear if Apple pulled out whether like who would do that would be 10 cent or would
[00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:16.400]   it be China Telecom.
[00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:18.440]   There's no really good solution for that.
[00:48:18.440 --> 00:48:20.360]   And also data is incredibly valuable.
[00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:24.440]   And we're talking about China right now, but there is a huge movement to repatriate data.
[00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:25.440]   People don't like the idea.
[00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:29.320]   And I know this always strikes Americans at odds as odd, but people don't like the idea
[00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:31.680]   internationally of America holding the keys to all the data.
[00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:35.520]   And I know for a lot of people outside the US, especially after San Bernardino and other
[00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:40.360]   things, and all the Snowden information, there was a huge amount of backlash against
[00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:42.240]   America holding all that data.
[00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:45.760]   China probably feels that the NSA has direct access to all the data of Chinese citizens
[00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:46.760]   right now.
[00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:50.160]   The same way the FBI believes that all the Huawei equipment gives China direct access
[00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:53.080]   to the American to American citizens data.
[00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:55.560]   And this is going to be something that plays out over years.
[00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:57.720]   And right now it's America and China and major markets.
[00:48:57.720 --> 00:49:02.760]   But when France passes a law that says you have to have localized data and you have to
[00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:07.200]   have a backdoor or when in the UK as part of their data, because they have a huge surveillance
[00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:10.520]   state and to their credit, they're transparent about it, not that it makes it great, but they're
[00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:11.760]   transparent about it.
[00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:14.920]   When they start passing these laws, we're going to be looking at a place where almost
[00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:17.200]   every country is going to want ownership of their data.
[00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:18.200]   It is so valuable.
[00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:21.240]   Google and Facebook spend billions of dollars acquiring it all the time.
[00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:23.040]   And these countries are realizing that value.
[00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:27.080]   And I think beyond the politics and the security implications, we're just seeing the very tip
[00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:30.160]   of the iceberg of sort of nation state ownership of data.
[00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:34.000]   >> Well, GDPR becomes the law of Europe in a couple of months.
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:39.800]   And this is going to be a similar issue where there are very strict privacy rules.
[00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:45.320]   Apple has said, Noreen Keral, who's vice president and chief litigation counsel at Apple, last
[00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:50.520]   fall said it will be a heavy burden, the heavy processing requirements and corporations
[00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:53.080]   doing business in Europe are just tremendous.
[00:49:53.080 --> 00:49:56.080]   It really does pose a challenge.
[00:49:56.080 --> 00:49:58.920]   >> And Microsoft is in front of the Supreme Court right now, but whether the US government
[00:49:58.920 --> 00:50:00.520]   can subpoena data on external servers.
[00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:02.880]   I mean, the whole thing is in turbulence.
[00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:05.080]   >> Yeah, they're arguing that today, aren't they?
[00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:10.920]   >> Yeah, I mean, I hate to say something quite this heavy, but I lately I've been sort of,
[00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:17.600]   if anything, 2016 and 2017 has made many of us keener students about the history of the
[00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:21.800]   1920s and 30s that we maybe skipped over that in high school.
[00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:27.400]   And I wish I weren't so aware that everything we're seeing about how we're manipulating data
[00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:31.560]   that we're asked this used to be sort of a one world community, that there is the Internet.
[00:50:31.560 --> 00:50:35.440]   You can't do anything about the Internet because the Internet is everywhere and nowhere at once.
[00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:38.600]   Now we see so many more laws and rules being placed to say that, no, no, no, this is the
[00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:39.600]   French Internet.
[00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:41.960]   And we have the, we have this is the American Internet.
[00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:47.200]   We have the ability to rule about what a French person's data is worth inside America.
[00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:52.000]   And Google is now dealing with the problem of the right to be forgotten.
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:56.120]   Basically, you take down notices of just stuff from the search engine that you just don't
[00:50:56.120 --> 00:51:03.800]   like, and not only is this mind boggling to people like us who grew up watching the Internet
[00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:09.840]   so free that if you just wanted to walk, walk into a server, it probably had an open
[00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:13.760]   door in the form of a guest account that was there specifically so that you can go, you
[00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:18.360]   can go into German university servers and just see what's there to the idea where no,
[00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:20.640]   no, no, this this Internet belongs to me.
[00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:25.320]   If there is an embarrassing picture of me from spring break 1992, I don't want it there
[00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:27.080]   anymore, you have to take it down.
[00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:30.680]   Or excuse me, you have to make sure people can't find it easily.
[00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:33.440]   That is that can be rather troubling.
[00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:38.040]   I so long as I don't have a big problem, so long as people have the ability to make their
[00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:40.680]   own choices, I don't have a problem.
[00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:45.720]   I wouldn't have a problem with China so long as people wanted to have their data stored
[00:51:45.720 --> 00:51:47.200]   elsewhere, they could do that.
[00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:49.280]   But of course, they don't have that option.
[00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:53.320]   So there's going to be so much trouble in the next 10 years over this.
[00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:54.720]   It's an interesting process that Apple is doing.
[00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:57.840]   So basically from the beginning of January for eight weeks, they're sending emails and
[00:51:57.840 --> 00:52:01.760]   push notifications that alert people that if you are in China and you are a Chinese
[00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:06.000]   citizen and you are using an iPhone within the country, they are going to start move,
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:07.960]   they are going to try to move your account to China.
[00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:11.840]   And you can say, you can agree to it, or you can say, no, I'm not really a Chinese person
[00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:15.600]   work in China subject to Chinese laws and refuse to have it migrated.
[00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:19.520]   If you don't do anything, they basically put up an agreement and you have to choose.
[00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:22.760]   There's no way sort of ignore it or not make a decision about it.
[00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:26.720]   So you have those two options, either turn off iCloud and stop using it, allow it to
[00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:30.400]   be migrated or say, no, no, I'm not really subject to these laws.
[00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:33.480]   And then they're still maintaining like the device is the same, the same hardware encryption
[00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:34.480]   on the device.
[00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:37.520]   The passcode is still no way to crack it, even Apple doesn't have that.
[00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:40.440]   And Apple maintains that they're still going to have control over the keys and controls
[00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:41.720]   over the data.
[00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:46.440]   But we like it's hard to believe that because we've seen in America, FISA courts and national
[00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:50.200]   security letters try to get around what people can say about who has access to what data
[00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:51.200]   anyway.
[00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:53.840]   So this is more of a beginning than an ending to me.
[00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:58.880]   Yeah, and what worries me is that naughty people are going to find ways to do naughty
[00:52:58.880 --> 00:52:59.960]   things.
[00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:06.240]   Like our own government, we surveillance surveillance organizations for surveillance organizations
[00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:11.000]   within the United States are specifically prohibited from conducting surveillance on its own citizens
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:12.560]   within its own borders.
[00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:18.560]   However, they are still free to tell, again, tell Francis electronic apparatus.
[00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:23.040]   By the way, we'd really like you to keep tabs on Andy Anatko's emails.
[00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:26.680]   And then we'd like you to give those emails to me.
[00:53:26.680 --> 00:53:28.680]   That's perfectly fine.
[00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:35.880]   I really think that if the next amendment to the United States Constitution is going to
[00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:41.840]   have to be Bill of Rights 10.5, in addition, that simply defines that here is what your
[00:53:41.840 --> 00:53:47.480]   rights are as an American citizen to the data that you generate simply by living here.
[00:53:47.480 --> 00:53:52.000]   And I believe that I should have the ability just like I can just like I have the ability
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:56.040]   to check my credit report, I can tell I can take a look at any person who has any scrap
[00:53:56.040 --> 00:54:00.000]   of data on me and simply ask them, send me I can do a file I can do a FOIA request and
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:03.800]   simply say, give me all the information you have on me that you've collected through my
[00:54:03.800 --> 00:54:05.960]   web browsing or through my bank transactions.
[00:54:05.960 --> 00:54:08.440]   So let me correct something that's incorrect.
[00:54:08.440 --> 00:54:12.000]   Maybe it's not right for me to be able to wipe out something that I don't like, but at least
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:13.000]   allow me to see that.
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:19.680]   Okay, for one thing, I don't know why you think I'm pro gun from, you might have might
[00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:21.280]   have seen you visit a couple of sites.
[00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:25.520]   I do I don't think it's I don't think it's guns should be illegal, but I'm not pro gun
[00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:27.520]   in the sense that I think that everybody should have them.
[00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:32.240]   Don't tell people that I'm pro gun, particularly if I'm applying for a home loan or something.
[00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:38.680]   And since so much of this data is being put to so many really bad uses, I really do believe
[00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:44.200]   them by being absolutely sincere here that just as revulsed as we are by pictures taken
[00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:49.920]   in the 1900s 1910s of five six year old children, their faces blackened with soot because they're
[00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:53.760]   spending 12 hours a day in a coal mine instead of in a classroom.
[00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:57.040]   There are going to be people 100 years from now that are going to be repulsed that we
[00:54:57.040 --> 00:55:02.320]   allowed big corporations and data aggregators to control so much of our lives without us
[00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:05.280]   having any idea or any power over that.
[00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:10.240]   I would like that to be a basic human right, not certainly up there with a right of freedom,
[00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:14.840]   right to jury trial, right to free speech, right to religion to the religion you want
[00:55:14.840 --> 00:55:16.640]   to honor.
[00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:21.440]   But that's going to be something that we've proven year after year that we desperately
[00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:22.440]   need.
[00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:23.440]   And it's nice.
[00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:25.920]   I mean, companies like Apple, they have the luxury because their business model is not
[00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:29.320]   made on retaining data that they can make data and accessible even to themselves.
[00:55:29.320 --> 00:55:30.320]   And that was initially the plan.
[00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:34.360]   I think iCloud was supposed to go completely invisible to Apple, but then they ran into
[00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:38.120]   brick walls, like the original version of two factor authentication.
[00:55:38.120 --> 00:55:42.080]   People lost their recovery keys and then they lost all their data and Apple was forced
[00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:44.840]   to refactor that in a way that was more convenient and less secure.
[00:55:44.840 --> 00:55:47.640]   And the same thing with backups, everyone once Apple didn't create backups, but then
[00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:49.600]   people can't get their backups anymore.
[00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:52.480]   And to them, they care more about the photos up in their backups and they do about some
[00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:55.520]   theoretical thread of another country getting access to their photos.
[00:55:55.520 --> 00:55:59.440]   And you have all these different agendas to service and it creates something that is
[00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:00.440]   so difficult.
[00:56:00.440 --> 00:56:04.840]   I still think that our smartphones, for example, are the closest things to cybernetics that
[00:56:04.840 --> 00:56:09.760]   we have right now and they deserve a privilege that is far greater than spousal or clerical
[00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:11.960]   or legal or medical privilege.
[00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:14.360]   But we just don't have laws for that kind of stuff yet.
[00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:17.960]   And it's not clear we're going to be getting laws anytime soon.
[00:56:17.960 --> 00:56:20.560]   If you want to view paradise, simply look around and view it.
[00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:21.600]   This is ever since I was a kid.
[00:56:21.600 --> 00:56:24.440]   I thought that was a very aspirational thing.
[00:56:24.440 --> 00:56:27.760]   The idea that we are, and you don't dream about paradise, we're here.
[00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:29.440]   We just need to not screw it up.
[00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:34.160]   At least that's the takeaway I got from that deeply disturbing later scene.
[00:56:34.160 --> 00:56:39.440]   But I mean that the idea of having a phone that tracks data on us everywhere, the idea
[00:56:39.440 --> 00:56:44.160]   that I can finally get ads, but none of the ones I hate, only the ones that I'm actually
[00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:45.160]   interested in.
[00:56:45.160 --> 00:56:51.600]   I don't mind that Amazon knows that I was looking at stand mixers for a long time.
[00:56:51.600 --> 00:56:55.160]   I don't mind getting a push notification saying, you know how you have these two different
[00:56:55.160 --> 00:56:57.720]   stand mixers in your wish list right now?
[00:56:57.720 --> 00:57:00.120]   One of them is that the lowest price has ever been on.
[00:57:00.120 --> 00:57:01.520]   That's good tracking.
[00:57:01.520 --> 00:57:06.480]   That's the idea of a phone collecting enough data on me that it can, in my watch, collect
[00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:10.760]   enough data that I can say, I'm not saying you're about to have a massive heart attack.
[00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:15.880]   I'm saying that maybe you want to have something checked out right now.
[00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:18.760]   If I can get that's paradise, that's wonderful.
[00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:21.120]   That's how beautiful life can be.
[00:57:21.120 --> 00:57:26.120]   We have to find a happy medium between trusting this device to collect so much information
[00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:30.760]   that I can enhance my life in a myriad ways and creating so few legal restraints against
[00:57:30.760 --> 00:57:36.840]   everybody collecting that data and exploiting it that you feel like you've got a home release
[00:57:36.840 --> 00:57:40.480]   collar around you at all times.
[00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:46.560]   I wonder if at some point, I mean, you have one idea of the future Andy, which is some
[00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:51.960]   utopian future where somebody, I don't know, who has intervened in this.
[00:57:51.960 --> 00:57:57.760]   John Luke Picard, we hope.
[00:57:57.760 --> 00:58:04.840]   I wonder, who knows what's going to happen, but I wouldn't be surprised to see a move
[00:58:04.840 --> 00:58:11.200]   from techies to create a, maybe for all I know it's already happened, a dark web that
[00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:16.640]   is outside the FCC's anti net neutrality rules.
[00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:23.520]   It is outside of these corporate spying that is kind of much more like the Garden of Eden
[00:58:23.520 --> 00:58:25.520]   Internet we had 20 years ago.
[00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:27.720]   Elon Musk could build it on Mars.
[00:58:27.720 --> 00:58:31.280]   Well, you know what, the truth is it's easy to build it right now.
[00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:34.320]   There is a dark net.
[00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:35.680]   I wouldn't be at all surprised.
[00:58:35.680 --> 00:58:41.040]   I think that there are probably a number of highly technologically sophisticated people
[00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:46.560]   like the folks at Signal, like Moxie Marlin Spike and others who are thinking about that.
[00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:53.280]   Why do we need an internet that is infested with corporate and government interests?
[00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:58.240]   Why don't we just have a heavy net?
[00:58:58.240 --> 00:59:03.520]   It's the same reason why we need a AAA and we need garages because we don't want to learn
[00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:04.840]   about how this stuff works.
[00:59:04.840 --> 00:59:06.640]   We just wanted to help our lives.
[00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:09.840]   And unfortunately, sometimes you really have to make that investment.
[00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:16.160]   If I want to know exactly what, when I click on a link in this browser, what is the chain
[00:59:16.160 --> 00:59:23.520]   of events that happens between that and getting the latest picture of John Cleese with a teacup
[00:59:23.520 --> 00:59:26.720]   on his head at a press event.
[00:59:26.720 --> 00:59:28.360]   People don't know how this stuff works.
[00:59:28.360 --> 00:59:32.320]   They don't realize that part of this is public infrastructure that they paid for.
[00:59:32.320 --> 00:59:34.360]   Some of it is privately controlled.
[00:59:34.360 --> 00:59:40.000]   Some of it is public infrastructure that has had private controls imposed upon it.
[00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:46.600]   One of the demos that I sometimes do for people when they want to know about this, like just
[00:59:46.600 --> 00:59:51.000]   casually, is that I will go to that page on Google that simply shows them all of the
[00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:54.160]   information that Google has been collecting about them.
[00:59:54.160 --> 00:59:58.840]   And the weird thing is, this isn't some sort of pirate thing that's been going on.
[00:59:58.840 --> 01:00:03.960]   This isn't like what ProPublica has been doing, treating the Google search engine and the
[01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:08.120]   search, excuse me, the Google and Facebook ranking algorithms as black boxes that's trying
[01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:09.960]   to probe them to figure out how they work.
[01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:13.480]   This is something that Google has put as part of their service saying, we want you to know
[01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:14.800]   what we're collecting.
[01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:17.680]   And their flabbergasted, my God, there's a map.
[01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:22.320]   I can click on a calendar and find out where I and my phone were every single day of the
[01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:23.320]   week.
[01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:25.120]   Like, okay, now you know it's collecting that.
[01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:27.960]   Now if you push this button, we'll stop collecting that information.
[01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:35.200]   So there's a certain amount of basic hygiene that kids need to be taught at an early age.
[01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:37.000]   They need to learn about money.
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.560]   They need to learn about personal hygiene.
[01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:43.280]   They need to learn about basic manners.
[01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:46.640]   But they also need to learn about this is what the internet is.
[01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:48.840]   This is where people get your information.
[01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:51.960]   And this is how you make those choices.
[01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:54.960]   I've been blathering on about this because as though I think that's the most important
[01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:56.720]   thing in the world, I kind of do.
[01:00:56.720 --> 01:01:00.440]   But on the other hand, my favorite browser is Chrome because I like the trade.
[01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:01.920]   I like the features it gives me.
[01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:05.760]   I don't necessarily, I could put a box on my home network that runs all of my traffic
[01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:06.880]   through a tour router.
[01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:09.040]   I don't because I don't like the speed hit.
[01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:12.920]   As long as people know about that and they have the right to say no, that's good.
[01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:15.440]   But they can't, freedom is useless without knowledge.
[01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:18.520]   And this is one of those situations.
[01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:26.880]   So this is from a tweet that Serenity Caldwell passed along from Vlad Zvov.
[01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:29.200]   I was about to hold it up.
[01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:32.280]   This is, he's at Mobile World Congress, the Verge.
[01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:33.560]   You could show my screen.
[01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:37.440]   Small notch, 26% smaller than Fruitphone X.
[01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:39.800]   I want a Fruitphone X now.
[01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:41.440]   We're kind of reaching here.
[01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:42.440]   Who is this?
[01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:43.440]   You know, is this Nokia?
[01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:44.440]   Who's too soon?
[01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:47.320]   I can't tell, but I do know that Brad Ellis is going to be super upset about their lack
[01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:51.360]   of super ellipses in the proper form.
[01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:52.520]   This is interesting.
[01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:58.320]   So there's on the left there, smaller notch, although not nearly as elegantly curved as
[01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:00.160]   the Fruitphone X on the right.
[01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:03.400]   It probably doesn't have all the same components in it either.
[01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:05.320]   Isn't that funny?
[01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:07.920]   This is competitive notching.
[01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:09.720]   Yeah, competitive notching.
[01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:10.720]   Vlad blew it.
[01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:12.920]   It's not that it has a smaller notch, it has bigger horns.
[01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:14.480]   I mean, that's the whole story.
[01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:15.800]   He's totally very the league.
[01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:16.800]   Bigger horns.
[01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:17.800]   Bigger horns.
[01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:20.240]   I have to figure out who's talking.
[01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:23.240]   Have you decided on ears or horns?
[01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:24.840]   I keep having to pause a second.
[01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:27.840]   I know you say horns because of Craig Federighi.
[01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:31.880]   It feels like I'm 99% sure that when he first saw that he called them horns.
[01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:34.000]   Boy, it feels like horns too.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.560]   Now that you say that, it's like a little bit of, yeah.
[01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:39.080]   I like ears because kitty cats have ears.
[01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:41.440]   I think they're unofficially called ears now.
[01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:44.280]   I just, I like them.
[01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:48.000]   Scooter X says, this is the Zen, Asus Zen Phone 5.
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.680]   This is the Asus keynote.
[01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:51.680]   Gosh.
[01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:52.680]   Bless you.
[01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:56.600]   That's too bad because Asus has been doing some really great stuff with their phones,
[01:02:56.600 --> 01:02:57.600]   particularly getting cracks.
[01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:02.200]   Cracks me up, they're putting a notch on there and then they're saying, but it's a 26%
[01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:03.200]   small.
[01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:04.200]   It's like, what the hell?
[01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:06.280]   I mean, the essential phone has a smaller notch than that.
[01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:07.280]   Yeah, really.
[01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:10.880]   50% bigger than the essential phone notch.
[01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:14.440]   Yeah, that's kind of sad.
[01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:16.720]   Also go fruit phone.
[01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:20.720]   How many discussions were had at what level before they changed that slide back and forth
[01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:21.720]   because I spoke to a trademark?
[01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:22.720]   You can't say apple.
[01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:23.720]   It's a trademark.
[01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:24.720]   They could just say blackberry.
[01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:25.720]   Just do it.
[01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:26.720]   I mean, come on.
[01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:30.480]   The show today brought to you by Rocket Mortgage Quick and Loans.
[01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:31.480]   Great lender.
[01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:36.000]   One of my favorites, actually one of your favorites, according to JD Power, number one in customer
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:39.280]   satisfaction, eight years running.
[01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:41.440]   That's pretty darn good.
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:45.360]   And now I think I'm even more in love with quick and loans because they've created a
[01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:50.440]   mortgage approval process entirely online made for us geeks.
[01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:54.640]   You could do this whole thing on your phone.
[01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:57.040]   It's called Rocket Mortgage.
[01:03:57.040 --> 01:04:00.080]   Quick and Loans realized the mortgage experience wasn't keeping up with the times.
[01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:01.080]   It was dated.
[01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:04.400]   It needed a client focused technological revolution.
[01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:08.800]   So they created Rocket Mortgage, gives you the confidence you need when it comes to buying
[01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:12.960]   a home or refinancing your existing home loan.
[01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:14.760]   Very simple.
[01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:16.400]   You don't have to.
[01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:21.000]   You know, if you go to a bank to get a loan, which is what I did the last time, big mistake,
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:25.360]   you fill out an application that is so long, so in depth and so complicated that you need
[01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:30.840]   to reference materials to answer some of those questions, not with Rocket Mortgage.

[01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:08.560]   Term rate, down payment and boom.

[01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:01.200]   We weren't finished.
[01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:02.360]   It's also got Zen emoji.
[01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:03.360]   Oh Lord.
[01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:04.360]   Oh Lord.
[01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:09.800]   The gift that keeps on giving as we speak.
[01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:10.800]   People are competing with Apple.
[01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:12.960]   That's best they can in Barcelona.
[01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:15.800]   Apple, this is another one from the chat room.
[01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:16.800]   Thank you.
[01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:17.800]   You guys are great from Pat and Lee Apple.
[01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:20.840]   I don't normally cover Apple patents, but that thought this was interesting.
[01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:25.440]   Apple files, major Apple TV logo trademark update.
[01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:31.560]   You see there it is focused on all things related to gaming, including a video game
[01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:32.560]   console.
[01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:35.760]   We'd heard rumors that Apple might be doing a video game console.
[01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:36.920]   Wouldn't be the first they did.
[01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:37.920]   What was the name of that one?
[01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:41.160]   Pippin, Pippin, two electric boogaloo.
[01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:43.160]   That was such a failure.
[01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:47.040]   Hey, they run for 500 bucks now.
[01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:51.240]   I almost bought one when they were when they were up to 300 because I thought it was such
[01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:53.360]   an odd thing that I wanted for my collection.
[01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:56.160]   The Apple Pippin, did they ever sell it or did they just?
[01:06:56.160 --> 01:06:57.160]   Oh yeah.
[01:06:57.160 --> 01:06:58.160]   No, Ben.
[01:06:58.160 --> 01:06:59.160]   I sold it.
[01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:00.160]   I think mostly in Japan.
[01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:01.160]   Yeah.
[01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:04.440]   And there and obviously they did so well that it is easy to find one mint inbox still.
[01:07:04.440 --> 01:07:09.320]   The patent, which relates to next generation gaming technology, is signed by one Norman
[01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:15.760]   Wang, his former senior software engineer at Sony and its PlayStation division.
[01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:20.520]   I mean, as you talked about, you think, or as Apple maximizes the amount of people who
[01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:24.400]   are going to buy iPhones, they have to start increasing the, like, what the common strategy
[01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:28.160]   is you get one thing really down and then you annex nearest neighbors and you do things
[01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:30.640]   like health and you do things like fitness.
[01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:32.080]   And then what else is proximity?
[01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:35.760]   Well, gaming and entertainment and you start adding those categories because you can't
[01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:38.000]   get any, there's not enough people to get, add more people.
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.480]   So you try to get more from all the people that you have.
[01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:41.480]   Yeah.
[01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:47.160]   But it's Apple in a position where they can really have that many businesses under the
[01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:48.800]   same roof anymore.
[01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:55.240]   It seemed more, we all know that it's all about these six to eight people in a conference
[01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:59.880]   room that are making all the decisions for everything at Apple as though it is one ecosystem
[01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:00.880]   together.
[01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:05.640]   But we're starting to get into places where, when you talk about Google, you're talking
[01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:09.920]   about breaking them up because the government is applying antitrust laws with Apple.
[01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:16.400]   It's like, can you really have these people integrating healthcare into the same ecosystem
[01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:17.920]   as earphones?
[01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:21.720]   Can you really have someone making a really great game platform that doesn't care what's
[01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:22.960]   happening?
[01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:26.920]   That does what it has to do to be an amazing game platform without figuring out how it
[01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:32.800]   enhances the iOS brand or how it enhances gaming on the phone.
[01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:37.120]   I think that there should be a couple of more pirate flags hanging up in Cupertino these
[01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:38.120]   days.
[01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:44.480]   What people may not know, when you register a trademark, you register in a category.
[01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:45.960]   And that trademark applies to that category.
[01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:47.760]   For instance, we have, this is our trademark.
[01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:53.280]   Twit is a trademark in the category of entertainment and the nature of visual and audio
[01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:54.880]   performances.
[01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:58.760]   And by the way, Andy, if you want to do more singing, musical, variety, news and comedy
[01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:00.320]   shows.
[01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:02.880]   So you're welcome.
[01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:03.880]   By the way, we got that one.
[01:09:03.880 --> 01:09:04.880]   I'm just looking here.
[01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:05.880]   Look at that.
[01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:06.880]   2006.
[01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:10.960]   Well, the first use in commerce, 2005, May 1st.
[01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:18.840]   But the point being that the Apple's trademark, which I think was for video hardware, has
[01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:22.780]   been updated to include video game consoles.
[01:09:22.780 --> 01:09:24.840]   This is the Apple TV trademark.
[01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:29.360]   Holders for game consoles, video output games, namely video output game machines for use
[01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:34.320]   with televisions, apparatus for electronic games adapted for use of an external display
[01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:36.560]   screen or monitor.
[01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:41.000]   Sometimes Apple, you look at these trademark and patent filings and it's just defensive
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.120]   to keep other people from getting into this.
[01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:48.440]   But this feels like Apple is maybe thinking about moving into this.
[01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:52.280]   There's a huge question for me is that Apple, people always say that Apple doesn't get hardcore
[01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:53.280]   gaming.
[01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:56.140]   They're hardcore gaming to the extent that they have many hardcore gamers among their
[01:09:56.140 --> 01:09:57.140]   CDR leadership.
[01:09:57.140 --> 01:10:00.880]   And they realized early on that the biggest profit to be made in gaming was casual gaming.
[01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:03.720]   It took the least amount of effort to make the most amount of money and given everything
[01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:06.720]   else they were focusing on, that just made the most sense for Apple as a business.
[01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:09.640]   That's why you have iOS as a monster game platform.
[01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:13.960]   You don't have them really competing for Call of Duty or for any of the big things we
[01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:16.280]   think of as classic consoles.
[01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:21.560]   But so the questions I have is does this mean that Apple has video games on the Apple TV?
[01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:24.240]   I've had that since they announced the SDK a couple of years ago.
[01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:28.240]   They didn't do a great job because they forced people to have the Siri controller and that
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:30.680]   led a lot of top studios to say, okay, bye, see ya.
[01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:32.840]   And they never really recovered from that.
[01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:35.720]   But the interesting thing to me is are they going to promote hardware that can provide
[01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:38.040]   more like people called AAA games?
[01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:41.480]   And it's Apple going to get some first party experience here because Apple doesn't make
[01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:43.480]   its own controller and Apple doesn't make its own game.
[01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:46.760]   And that means that developers hit all those APIs first.
[01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:48.680]   They have all the problems with the system.
[01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:51.680]   If Apple made their own games, I don't think we would have seen the Siri controller as
[01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:52.680]   first among equals.
[01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:57.880]   I don't think we would have seen the restrictions to the on-demand resources that we saw that
[01:10:57.880 --> 01:10:59.920]   really hobbled a lot of initial games.
[01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:03.720]   And if Apple made their own controller and you had the option to buy an Apple TV with
[01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:06.920]   a controller, then it would be a much more serious video purchase for people.
[01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:09.880]   So I think like the regards of the trademark, I'd want to see how Apple starts to position
[01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:13.120]   themselves before I go, oh, Apple's getting back into video games.
[01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:19.080]   By the way, don't try to use your first generation Apple TV to access the iTunes store.
[01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:20.080]   They're going to-
[01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:21.080]   That's from 2007.
[01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:22.080]   I'm okay with that.
[01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:23.560]   They're going to cut you off.
[01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:25.280]   And when does XP invest?
[01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:26.280]   Yeah.
[01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:27.280]   You've got to get those things.
[01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:29.880]   One of the biggest, and I don't want to get off my attention, one of the biggest problems
[01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:34.040]   with iTunes right now is this Apple's XP and they have people who are buying iPods who
[01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:39.760]   connect them over dock cables to Windows machines and they've got to sync them.
[01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:43.000]   So the more stuff they can get off that platform, the faster we can get off of iTunes or the
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:44.000]   platform.
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.480]   Oh, do you think that'll ever happen though?
[01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:46.480]   I don't see any indication.
[01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:47.480]   You say?
[01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:50.560]   There's billions of dollars going through there every day, Leo.
[01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:52.000]   You don't replace that bridge.
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:53.720]   You very slowly build a new bridge.
[01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:58.080]   Well, but I think that's long overdue for Apple to simply say that, okay, you had a
[01:11:58.080 --> 01:11:59.880]   great ride with your iPod classic.
[01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:00.880]   Now it's over with.
[01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:06.680]   I agree with you that the original clip size to post your stamp iPod and down with a color
[01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:10.440]   screen was awesome, but that's over with now.
[01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:12.160]   I still have most of my iPods.
[01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:18.800]   I still love them, but I'm still, I'm actually, as I've been going through like closets full
[01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:23.120]   of stuff as every time I pull out like fifth generation iPod, I'm one step closer to buying
[01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:28.240]   that kit that lets you replace the spinning micro hard drive with an SD card.
[01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:34.840]   So I would kind of like to have a full 256 gigabytes of storage on this really cool remote
[01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:36.640]   controlled size device.
[01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:40.240]   But yeah, iTunes is a recurring theme year after year.
[01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:44.920]   Even when I started doing this show like 10 years ago, I think that was a recurring theme
[01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:48.480]   about how awkward iTunes has become.
[01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:52.920]   And it really needs to be, it needs to be destroyed and replaced with something equally
[01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:54.480]   unlikely and improbable.
[01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:57.360]   Well, good news for HomePod.
[01:12:57.360 --> 01:13:01.400]   This is from NPD, one of the, you know, analyst groups.
[01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:08.280]   They say day one sales of the HomePod outpaced all other smart speaker first day pre-orders,
[01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:13.640]   kept the Echo Dot, which was so inexpensive that it had a lot of pre-orders at 40 bucks.
[01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:19.960]   This is NPD has some sort of monitoring service called checkout that Apple doesn't say, of
[01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:22.720]   course, but so this is the only data point we're going to get.
[01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:25.960]   But very good first day sales for the HomePod.
[01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:26.960]   I'm not surprised.
[01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:31.000]   Really though, it's really day two and week two and month two and year two that are going
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:32.000]   to matter in the world.
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:33.000]   And with Apple Watch?
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:34.000]   Yeah.
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:35.000]   Yeah.
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:40.840]   It's not even a fight between the Echo Dot and the HomePod, not just because of Apple
[01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:44.800]   auto quality, but let's see how many people when they're polled six months later, are
[01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:46.600]   you still using it on a regular basis?
[01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:54.200]   I think there are a lot of people who have Echo Dots that they unplugged it two months
[01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:58.040]   later so that they have room to plug in something else and they forgot to plug it back in and
[01:13:58.040 --> 01:14:02.200]   then not until they finally do their spring cleaning where they pull out the furniture
[01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:03.200]   from the wall.
[01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:05.800]   Well, they find, oh, it actually fell under the bed three months ago and I forgot about
[01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:06.800]   it.
[01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:11.160]   So how big of an impact can you have in an individual user's life is the most important
[01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:12.160]   metric to me?
[01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:13.160]   Yeah.
[01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:15.120]   Good news for law enforcement.
[01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:20.680]   According to Forbes Cybersecurity, the feds can now probably unlock every iPhone model
[01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:27.600]   in existence, celebrate the Israeli company that is the go to, they're the go to guys
[01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:32.040]   when you've got a locked mobile device you want to get into are telling customers they
[01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:36.840]   have the ability to get around security of all devices running iOS 11, including the
[01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:37.840]   iPhone 10.
[01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:39.400]   I call it shenanigans.
[01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:40.400]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:43.080]   How many are they talking about iPhone 11.0?
[01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:46.000]   Are they talking about the one that was released three four weeks ago?
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:50.640]   There's a reason why these updates, these data updates come so frequently and why on
[01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:52.160]   the iPhone, that's the reason.
[01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:56.520]   That's the one thing where I'll give, always give the OS provider the benefit of the doubt
[01:14:56.520 --> 01:15:00.160]   and always apply these updates immediately because I really usually think that it's because
[01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:04.480]   they found security vulnerability that they figure out how to patch and it's less value.
[01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:08.560]   This kind of a thing is much less valuable on an Apple phone than on an Android phone
[01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:13.200]   because with an Apple phone, it's part of the culture that you apply, that you keep applying
[01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:14.480]   patches as they come in.
[01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:16.000]   You don't wait for them to build up.
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:19.840]   No, nor do you have to wait for someone to release a patch.
[01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:24.040]   So this, okay, it's nice marketing, but oh well.
[01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:28.840]   What is marzipan besides a delicious almond flavored tree?
[01:15:28.840 --> 01:15:30.920]   That's homestarts girlfriend.
[01:15:30.920 --> 01:15:35.600]   So marzipan was a story broken by Mark Gurman.
[01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:40.240]   We talked about him previously and it was a, he heard that Apple was working on a framework
[01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:43.640]   that would allow essentially iOS apps to run on macOS.
[01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:48.360]   Now my understanding is that sort of like what we saw with APFS, the Apple file system,
[01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:51.960]   Apple had several internal candidates and eventually APFS one was swift.
[01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:55.400]   They had several different languages they were looking at and eventually swift one.
[01:15:55.400 --> 01:16:00.120]   My understanding is that when Apple put together, for example, there used to be separate messages
[01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:03.840]   team for Macs and a separate messages team for iOS and those teams merged.
[01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:07.240]   So now the engineering resources are shared, but they still make separate interfaces.
[01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:09.280]   But that creates a lot of pressure on Apple.
[01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:10.280]   How can they optimize?
[01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:13.640]   How can they better produce apps that work on both iOS and macOS?
[01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:18.040]   Because right now it breaks my soul that I see Leo sent you fireworks on the Mac and
[01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:20.400]   I still two years later don't have fireworks.
[01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:23.800]   It's a problem that Apple has to solve and marzipan was one of the ways, I don't know
[01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:26.160]   if it's going to end up being the way that they eventually announced.
[01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:31.640]   But the idea of it is that it will allow developers to more easily share code between
[01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:33.400]   iOS and macOS development.
[01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:36.480]   And Craig Hockenberry, he gave this great explanation.
[01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:39.440]   We were saying right now they can share the data back and forth.
[01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:40.440]   And that's great.
[01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:45.680]   If he or Sean, his development partner, Sean Herbert, fixed something on the iOS version
[01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:49.040]   is automatically fixed on the Mac version and vice versa.
[01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:50.760]   But they don't really share the model.
[01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:53.720]   So like the great, like the rendering, everything they've built around those apps.
[01:16:53.720 --> 01:16:55.240]   It's still separate.
[01:16:55.240 --> 01:16:58.360]   And of course the interfaces are never going to be the same because you have a mouse and
[01:16:58.360 --> 01:17:04.000]   a menu and a pointer on macOS and you have multi-touch and your finger and the different
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:05.680]   sorts of view controllers on the iPhone.
[01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:09.640]   But if Apple could just make it easier for developers who put a lot of work into an iOS
[01:17:09.640 --> 01:17:14.120]   app to bring those apps to the Mac, the idea is that it will result in more and better
[01:17:14.120 --> 01:17:15.120]   Mac apps.
[01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:18.680]   And for example, I spoke to Greg Pierce who does drafts, the wonderful drafts app and
[01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:19.920]   he doesn't have a Mac app.
[01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:23.160]   And I asked him, said, if this was real, would he like it?
[01:17:23.160 --> 01:17:28.120]   And he said, well, if it's just running an iPad app in a simulator, I'd do it because
[01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:30.080]   there'd be like three people who want it.
[01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:32.880]   But what I really hope is that they would be away from me to not have to go and learn
[01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:34.560]   app kit, for example.
[01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:38.080]   And you have the coordinate system backwards or have the colors be different and I have
[01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:39.480]   to solve for all of those things.
[01:17:39.480 --> 01:17:43.520]   But if it was just easier for me to take drafts and make a Mac interface for it and run it
[01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:45.280]   on the Mac, he'd be all over it.
[01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:49.960]   I think that is sort of the, I think that's a huge appeal to this is just to make it so
[01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:54.200]   that the millions of iOS developers can sort of share that love back to the Mac.
[01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:58.240]   You talked to, you had, boy, I mean, you had Lauren Britter from Tweety Paul, out of
[01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:02.960]   Tweetbot, Craig Hottenberry of Twitterific, but also from Halide, which you've talked
[01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:06.840]   before about a great camera app, Bents and Dosti, Greg Pierce of drafts.
[01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:09.120]   And so these guys are developers.
[01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:10.920]   They know what's possible.
[01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:13.440]   They also know what they would like.
[01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:14.440]   And I think they agree.
[01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:15.440]   It was clear.
[01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:19.640]   This is on the vector podcast that, hey, it's not that hard to do.
[01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:24.520]   They're already working in unified environment with Xcode and a lot of the underlying libraries
[01:18:24.520 --> 01:18:28.880]   are similar and be there would be, they would love to do it.
[01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:30.960]   As would Apple, right?
[01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:31.960]   Go ahead, Andy.
[01:18:31.960 --> 01:18:34.800]   Oh, no, I was just, I was just going to say that.
[01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:38.040]   Yeah, I don't, I don't listen to many tech podcasts because there's so many of them and
[01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:41.520]   usually podcasts are for like house cleaning and relaxing.
[01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:43.200]   But I definitely downloaded and listened to that one.
[01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:44.640]   And boy, was that a solid?
[01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:46.360]   That was a really good show.
[01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:48.280]   I just wanted a compliment for that.
[01:18:48.280 --> 01:18:49.280]   Absolutely.
[01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:52.900]   And the developers on really gives it some heft because these are people who would be working
[01:18:52.900 --> 01:18:53.900]   with MARTs.
[01:18:53.900 --> 01:18:54.900]   Yeah.
[01:18:54.900 --> 01:18:58.820]   Well, and I just like just speaking personally, I was familiar with a couple of those points
[01:18:58.820 --> 01:19:00.680]   of view, but not all of them.
[01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:03.440]   And so just, I was, I was thinking more large scale.
[01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:06.120]   I wasn't thinking about something as small scale as I forgot.
[01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:08.120]   I forget who was talking about this.
[01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:09.220]   And I'm going to paraphrase it.
[01:19:09.220 --> 01:19:14.360]   But it's kind of like when you have having iOS and Mac apps that you're developing side
[01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:19.880]   by side, just the fact that the UK recipe for this cake calls for caster sugar.
[01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:23.760]   If it just said, if everyone just decided that powdered sugar is what we're going to
[01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:27.920]   call this one thing, it's not necessarily a different recipe.
[01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:30.840]   They're just trying to render fonts in a specific way.
[01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:36.160]   If they just simply call this routine the same thing on both platforms so that you just
[01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:40.040]   simply cut and paste between libraries, just that would be a big thing.
[01:19:40.040 --> 01:19:42.440]   So it's again, very much worth a listen.
[01:19:42.440 --> 01:19:45.480]   Now, Renee, the person who actually had this conversation perhaps, you should.
[01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:50.760]   Well, next time you get all these guys together, ask them if they'd like Apple to support progressive
[01:19:50.760 --> 01:19:51.760]   web apps.
[01:19:51.760 --> 01:19:54.680]   Because I think this is something Apple's missing the boat on a little bit.
[01:19:54.680 --> 01:19:57.600]   Christina Warren touched on that quite a lot because she's at Microsoft now.
[01:19:57.600 --> 01:19:58.960]   She was my first post for the episode.
[01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:01.240]   Microsoft and Google are big proponents of this.
[01:20:01.240 --> 01:20:02.240]   Yeah.
[01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:06.760]   Apple has had a different approach because Apple, Microsoft is doing this with the Edge
[01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:09.240]   now, but Microsoft had a native app platform.
[01:20:09.240 --> 01:20:11.840]   Google had Android, but never really had a native app platform for Chrome.
[01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:15.800]   It really behooved them because they own the browser, sort of do these progressive web
[01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:16.800]   apps.
[01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:20.240]   And Apple's thing was, and this goes all the way back to the early days of Safari and
[01:20:20.240 --> 01:20:25.360]   Don Milton, and when they were discussing using WebKit as a primary interface for the iPhone,
[01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:29.160]   for example, that web apps are good at one thing and native apps are good at one thing.
[01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:31.200]   And they don't want to make, you know, native apps try to run on the web.
[01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:32.880]   They don't want to make web apps run native.
[01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:36.680]   They think that they have platforms that do both those things very well separately.
[01:20:36.680 --> 01:20:40.320]   But when you're in a world where the web is increasingly, and we talked about this because
[01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:43.920]   there's some sentiment in the Mac community that Mac apps are being left behind, but it's
[01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:47.760]   not really Mac apps, it's desktop apps, all the big revolutionary apps are not appearing
[01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:49.160]   on the Mac or on Windows anymore.
[01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:51.200]   They're appearing on Android and iOS.
[01:20:51.200 --> 01:20:54.640]   It's like the Ubers and the Lifts and the Instagrams and all those apps that are changing
[01:20:54.640 --> 01:20:55.640]   the world.
[01:20:55.640 --> 01:20:57.200]   And sort of the web is becoming more accepted.
[01:20:57.200 --> 01:21:00.960]   In the old days, you turn your nose up at a Java app or an Air app.
[01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:04.840]   And now Slack is probably the most important desktop app right now, or the most important
[01:21:04.840 --> 01:21:05.840]   new desktop app right now.
[01:21:05.840 --> 01:21:10.280]   And it's, it's a electron app, you know, and a lot of other similar tools are electron
[01:21:10.280 --> 01:21:12.480]   apps, and that's becoming increasingly a thing.
[01:21:12.480 --> 01:21:16.240]   And if people aren't familiar, an electron app is basically Chrome wrapped around a specific
[01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:17.240]   web page.
[01:21:17.240 --> 01:21:20.400]   So it feels like a native app and gives you some of the abilities of native app.
[01:21:20.400 --> 01:21:23.400]   But if you hit like command R, it'll still reload like a web page.
[01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:25.080]   That's the big tell.
[01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:26.240]   And I think that's a really true debate.
[01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:29.560]   I think Apple would still kind of turns and nose up a little bit at that because you don't
[01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:30.560]   get the performance.
[01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:34.520]   They got a native code, but as the world moves to Weblio, I think the desktop, the
[01:21:34.520 --> 01:21:38.960]   desktop, if something like Marzipan doesn't help reclaim the desktop for native apps, then
[01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:41.080]   I think aggressive web apps are more of the future.
[01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:46.680]   My feeling Marzipan is an old fashioned way of dealing with this kind of something like
[01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:55.520]   Java and swing, where you have kind of, you attempt to make native tools for both platforms
[01:21:55.520 --> 01:21:58.720]   and then an underlying shared code base.
[01:21:58.720 --> 01:22:01.720]   And I know I think progressive web apps is a much more modern way to do it.
[01:22:01.720 --> 01:22:04.080]   And Apple's going to get pressure to do it.
[01:22:04.080 --> 01:22:08.480]   If it does end up starting to take hold, they're going to have to do it.
[01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:13.880]   But until they support it in Safari and iOS with service workers, I don't know, you know,
[01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:15.280]   that's a big stopping point for it.
[01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:16.920]   And I'd like to see them support it.
[01:22:16.920 --> 01:22:20.080]   It means that true cross platform development is possible.
[01:22:20.080 --> 01:22:24.760]   It opens up a, I think of, for instance, you know, I'm interested in it because we could
[01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:32.400]   make a Twit mobile website that would you'd go on an Android phone or an iPhone or some
[01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:37.400]   other device, as yet unnamed, go to that site.
[01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:39.560]   It would download pieces of the code.
[01:22:39.560 --> 01:22:43.400]   It would start working offline as a podcast app.
[01:22:43.400 --> 01:22:47.200]   And it would be, I don't believe that it can't be as performant as a desktop app.
[01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:50.440]   I think that's, I mean, we saw Facebook try they threw out the app.
[01:22:50.440 --> 01:22:51.880]   Basically Facebook does, right?
[01:22:51.880 --> 01:22:55.240]   Well, but they, but they threw out, I forget, they were using a lecture.
[01:22:55.240 --> 01:22:57.240]   They threw out Joe's app that he made for iOS.
[01:22:57.240 --> 01:23:00.360]   So even the iOS app and they reprogrammed that it's a progressive web app because, hey,
[01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:01.440]   we're a web company.
[01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:04.040]   And then Mark Zuckerberg had to come out and go, yeah, it sucks.
[01:23:04.040 --> 01:23:06.080]   Well, but it was, that was early days.
[01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:10.320]   And if you don't have support on the platforms, that's why it's important Apple supports it.
[01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:13.360]   If you don't have support in the platforms, it is going to be just a wrapper around a
[01:23:13.360 --> 01:23:14.520]   website.
[01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:16.800]   That's not what PWA is.
[01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:17.880]   So but Apple has to support it.
[01:23:17.880 --> 01:23:23.080]   They have to put service workers on iOS and I'm sure they won't be for competitive reasons
[01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:24.280]   more than anything else, frankly.
[01:23:24.280 --> 01:23:26.480]   I mean, I think then it's just it does.
[01:23:26.480 --> 01:23:30.040]   Again, I understand the appeal to it, but to me, it's the same thing as right when it's
[01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:34.600]   deployed anywhere and that it makes life easier for developers at the expensive user experience.
[01:23:34.600 --> 01:23:38.920]   And I think no matter what we do, native apps are still a much better experience, much more
[01:23:38.920 --> 01:23:39.920]   performance.
[01:23:39.920 --> 01:23:42.600]   They leverage the hardware and especially the unique elements of hardware way better
[01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:44.000]   than progressive web apps.
[01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.720]   And I think it's just in Google's vested interest to get everybody in progressive web
[01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:49.760]   apps, but I don't think it's necessarily an end user interest yet.
[01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:52.200]   Maybe five, we always say that in five years, they'll be great.
[01:23:52.200 --> 01:23:53.800]   Five years never show up.
[01:23:53.800 --> 01:23:54.800]   Yeah.
[01:23:54.800 --> 01:23:55.800]   Yeah.
[01:23:55.800 --> 01:23:58.000]   If Mars depends, the whole point is just to make it less expensive and less trouble
[01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:01.040]   for developers to create apps for Mac or iOS.
[01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:02.040]   I'm all for it.
[01:24:02.040 --> 01:24:06.480]   It may not be the reason why I found this podcast so enlightening for me personally is that
[01:24:06.480 --> 01:24:10.800]   I was always thinking about it maybe a couple of extra steps ahead as opposed to solving
[01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:12.520]   an immediate problem.
[01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:14.680]   And so really that's all that's all it needs to do.
[01:24:14.680 --> 01:24:18.200]   And I think that it will help both both platforms.
[01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:23.760]   Google is working on a new operating system called Fuchsia, which I always mispronounced,
[01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:28.040]   but it's a they've been releasing code.
[01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:32.120]   They've been releasing functional binaries that people can build.
[01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:38.200]   They have not talked about it as the future of Google app development.
[01:24:38.200 --> 01:24:41.960]   But this is what we're this when I see this sort of stuff being built, I've not been able
[01:24:41.960 --> 01:24:42.960]   to build it myself.
[01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:43.960]   I don't have the hardware for it.
[01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:47.760]   But when I see people explain it, if this really does look like next generation stuff
[01:24:47.760 --> 01:24:52.440]   where a screen is just a screen is just a screen, which requires a whole new attitude
[01:24:52.440 --> 01:24:56.320]   towards what a document is, what data is and what an application is.
[01:24:56.320 --> 01:25:01.000]   So that's how big that's that you really have to turn that flip that table all the
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.640]   way over to make something that radical.
[01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:08.200]   And if Windows has taught us anything, it's that people are okay with something that does
[01:25:08.200 --> 01:25:09.880]   the job and is perfectly functional.
[01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:16.720]   The fact that they really have to they have to get doctors strange to create an evil incantation
[01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:21.520]   in league with Mephisto to get people to stop using Windows XP for God's sakes to get
[01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:24.080]   people to stop using Vista for God's sakes.
[01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:27.920]   That shows when you have a system that simply works and it's it doesn't it doesn't simply
[01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:29.360]   break down and stop.
[01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:32.120]   And the company does nothing to simply unplug it.
[01:25:32.120 --> 01:25:34.040]   People will continue to want to use it people.
[01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:39.120]   So I think that people are going to have to create a need for a next generation operating
[01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:46.120]   system before this actually becomes a productive thing.
[01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:49.840]   I obviously live in a utopia that will never exist, but we're.
[01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:54.360]   We're getting there with legal lead.
[01:25:54.360 --> 01:25:57.120]   Everything seems like you don't.
[01:25:57.120 --> 01:25:59.040]   Let's let's do our picks of the week.
[01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:05.840]   What do you say, gentlemen, perhaps starting with would maybe you have one?
[01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:07.040]   I don't see one in here.
[01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:11.840]   I thought I usually sneak it in there before we do it.
[01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:12.960]   You could sneak it in later.
[01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:13.960]   That's why I'm giving you a chance.
[01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:15.360]   I can go to Andy and let you.
[01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:19.800]   No, I don't know if I've picked this before, but I've been using it a lot lately.
[01:26:19.800 --> 01:26:20.800]   Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:21.800]   Don't tell us what that is.
[01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:22.800]   Okay.
[01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:25.800]   It's a hockey.
[01:26:25.800 --> 01:26:30.920]   Oh, it's the new NHL hockey puck.
[01:26:30.920 --> 01:26:33.520]   It's the new wired hockey puck.
[01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:36.080]   The Internet of Things hockey puck.
[01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:37.080]   No, no, no.
[01:26:37.080 --> 01:26:38.080]   I've seen those before.
[01:26:38.080 --> 01:26:40.320]   You put it underneath the cushion in your chair.
[01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:43.320]   And so when you're playing those video games, it gives you a rumble in a very special place.
[01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:44.960]   It makes you feel like you're connected to the action.
[01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:46.520]   It's actually I want this.
[01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:48.600]   I want this badly actually.
[01:26:48.600 --> 01:26:49.600]   This is a...
[01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:53.640]   Now, is it just USB or does it support Thunderbolt 3?
[01:26:53.640 --> 01:26:57.160]   So I mean, one of the problems with USB Thunderbolt 3 is that it's the same connected.
[01:26:57.160 --> 01:26:58.160]   I know, it's very confusing.
[01:26:58.160 --> 01:27:00.760]   It's joined by one connector, but separated by two standards.
[01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:03.080]   It's like British and American English.
[01:27:03.080 --> 01:27:05.840]   And you're supposed to be able to talk to each other, but just nobody knows what Hyde
[01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:07.840]   Park or baseball is.
[01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:09.800]   So it connects over...
[01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:10.800]   I'm going to say USB.
[01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:11.800]   It's called the Art.
[01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:12.800]   I don't know if I can.
[01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:13.800]   Pub from Boorish Design.
[01:27:13.800 --> 01:27:15.800]   Boorish Design, yes.
[01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:18.240]   You would buy it and like it.
[01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:21.680]   And this solves the problem of...
[01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:23.840]   Apple is all in on USB...
[01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:29.280]   USB C and Thunderbolt 3 to the extent that the MacBook Pro does not have any legacy ports.
[01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:30.280]   Even the IMAC...
[01:27:30.280 --> 01:27:32.840]   I'm using an IMAC Pro to talk to you on this podcast right now.
[01:27:32.840 --> 01:27:34.840]   And it has a dazzling array of ports.
[01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:41.400]   It has four USB C, four USB SD card slot, but it doesn't, for example, have an HDMI port.
[01:27:41.400 --> 01:27:42.400]   So it's no matter...
[01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:45.440]   I just realized that no matter what port I want, there's just never going to be enough.
[01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:47.520]   It doesn't have a Thunderbolt 2 port either.
[01:27:47.520 --> 01:27:50.880]   So what's nice about this is you plug it in and I'm going to plug this in.
[01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:51.880]   I'll give you a little adapter.
[01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:55.600]   via the USB C plug there, yeah.
[01:27:55.600 --> 01:27:56.600]   USB C plug.
[01:27:56.600 --> 01:27:58.760]   And then as I turn it around, it has HDMI.
[01:27:58.760 --> 01:28:03.120]   I was playing with the HTC Vive on the IMAC Pro earlier today.
[01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:05.800]   And I needed Thunderbolt 2 or HDMI and I hadn't either.
[01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:07.600]   So I broke this baby out.
[01:28:07.600 --> 01:28:13.160]   So you have USB C there, you have HDMI, you have SD card.
[01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:16.320]   If you need another one or the MacBook Pro, you have doesn't have it.
[01:28:16.320 --> 01:28:19.760]   It has Thunderbolt 2 or Display port, you know, because, you know, why?
[01:28:19.760 --> 01:28:22.320]   Why I ever have one connect for two different standards?
[01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:27.920]   And then you have two normal USB type A connectors as well.
[01:28:27.920 --> 01:28:31.160]   And it doesn't look like, like, it's not the neatest smallest tuck it in next to your
[01:28:31.160 --> 01:28:32.760]   computer and make it disappear.
[01:28:32.760 --> 01:28:34.040]   I wanted to own the Hub Lio.
[01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:36.160]   You know, like you own the horns on the iPhone 10.
[01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:37.160]   I wanted to own the Hub.
[01:28:37.160 --> 01:28:39.360]   If I was going to have a Hub, it wasn't going to be this thing that sort of flopped right
[01:28:39.360 --> 01:28:40.360]   next to my computer.
[01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:44.160]   It was going to be something that looked great and sort of sat there proudly in its own
[01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:45.160]   right.
[01:28:45.160 --> 01:28:47.200]   It's like a satellite, it's like a docking station.
[01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:50.240]   It's like the Deep Space Nine for my enterprise of a computer.
[01:28:50.240 --> 01:28:51.320]   And it just sits there.
[01:28:51.320 --> 01:28:55.680]   And I've been using it on Mac Break Weekly when I use my MacBook Pro because I put the
[01:28:55.680 --> 01:28:58.520]   web camera in and I put my microphone in.
[01:28:58.520 --> 01:28:59.520]   And I'm using it now.
[01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:04.000]   I was using it just before for the HTC Vive, like I said, because I needed multiple USB
[01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.080]   and HDMI and Thunderbolt 2.
[01:29:06.080 --> 01:29:10.400]   And it's just great to have all the ports you want in this little Canadian style hockey
[01:29:10.400 --> 01:29:11.400]   website.
[01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:15.400]   The Canadian style hockey puck of a design, I mean, you can't make better than a hockey
[01:29:15.400 --> 01:29:16.400]   puck.
[01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:17.400]   Tim Hortons has tried.
[01:29:17.400 --> 01:29:19.400]   And I just, I found it really helpful and really useful.
[01:29:19.400 --> 01:29:20.400]   So I've been carrying it.
[01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:21.400]   $135.
[01:29:21.400 --> 01:29:22.400]   Yeah.
[01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:26.240]   It doesn't have Thunderbolt 3, but it does have a second port so you could charge while
[01:29:26.240 --> 01:29:28.400]   you're using it, which is nice.
[01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:33.280]   I spent a lot of money for this, you know, crazy Thunderbolt 3 dock from other world computing,
[01:29:33.280 --> 01:29:34.280]   but that's from my iPad Pro.
[01:29:34.280 --> 01:29:35.280]   I love that one too.
[01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:36.280]   Yeah.
[01:29:36.280 --> 01:29:37.280]   But it's 300 bucks.
[01:29:37.280 --> 01:29:38.280]   It's twice as expensive.
[01:29:38.280 --> 01:29:41.000]   But it, you know, so if you need Thunderbolt 3, this is what's...
[01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.960]   I have to, I explain this on the radio show.
[01:29:43.960 --> 01:29:45.720]   It feels like every week now.
[01:29:45.720 --> 01:29:46.720]   It's terrible.
[01:29:46.720 --> 01:29:51.400]   It looks like Thunderbolt, but it's, you could be, it's just USB-C.
[01:29:51.400 --> 01:29:54.600]   And you need the right, and why, like why did they do this to us?
[01:29:54.600 --> 01:29:55.960]   Like, I don't understand.
[01:29:55.960 --> 01:30:00.280]   But then obviously because it supports HDMI and Thunderbolt 2, that's more than just USB
[01:30:00.280 --> 01:30:02.280]   3.1 port.
[01:30:02.280 --> 01:30:03.280]   Yeah.
[01:30:03.280 --> 01:30:05.400]   So it supports video, it supports power, I presume, right?
[01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:06.400]   You could power it.
[01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:07.400]   Yep.
[01:30:07.400 --> 01:30:08.400]   Yeah.
[01:30:08.400 --> 01:30:10.920]   It supports data at 3 point, USB 3.1 speeds.
[01:30:10.920 --> 01:30:12.560]   Not Thunderbolt 3 speeds, that's all.
[01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:13.560]   Yeah.
[01:30:13.560 --> 01:30:14.560]   That's pretty nice.
[01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:16.760]   And I think about the whole thing, like I spent a week just looking for Thunderbolt 3
[01:30:16.760 --> 01:30:20.000]   things, Leo, and so many things that people say are Thunderbolt 3 are really just USB-C.
[01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:21.000]   And the cables are hard.
[01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:22.200]   I mean, it's just, it's not driving.
[01:30:22.200 --> 01:30:23.200]   Especially drives.
[01:30:23.200 --> 01:30:25.840]   I mean, if you're going to get a Thunderbolt 3 drive, you're going to spend thousands of
[01:30:25.840 --> 01:30:26.840]   dollars.
[01:30:26.840 --> 01:30:29.240]   And you think you're getting one because the connector looks the same way you realize
[01:30:29.240 --> 01:30:32.760]   it's just USB-C and it only goes with USB 3.0 or 3.1 speeds.
[01:30:32.760 --> 01:30:33.760]   Very frustrating.
[01:30:33.760 --> 01:30:35.480]   You just want to end it all.
[01:30:35.480 --> 01:30:38.760]   The other one, the computing dock really works very nicely.
[01:30:38.760 --> 01:30:39.760]   Yeah.
[01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:43.280]   If you buy an iMac Pro, that means you have so much money, you don't mind the $300.
[01:30:43.280 --> 01:30:44.480]   And it's matching space gray.
[01:30:44.480 --> 01:30:45.480]   It's space gray.
[01:30:45.480 --> 01:30:46.480]   Yeah.
[01:30:46.480 --> 01:30:50.120]   Am I about mine before I've got the iMac Pro, so mine's silver?
[01:30:50.120 --> 01:30:51.360]   I think I should.
[01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:52.360]   That's what my trackpad is.
[01:30:52.360 --> 01:30:54.680]   I have the iMac Pro, but I won't use it.
[01:30:54.680 --> 01:30:55.680]   It's sitting here.
[01:30:55.680 --> 01:30:58.480]   I'm not going to use it because this is the Thread and Apple's design Afghan.
[01:30:58.480 --> 01:31:00.800]   It's just the worst thing ever.
[01:31:00.800 --> 01:31:01.800]   I know.
[01:31:01.800 --> 01:31:04.240]   But my trackpad is silver like an animal and I have to sit here using it.
[01:31:04.240 --> 01:31:08.880]   I should trade you my black or whatever, space gray trackpad.
[01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:10.880]   I actually have the mouse and the...
[01:31:10.880 --> 01:31:12.040]   Did I get the trackpad?
[01:31:12.040 --> 01:31:13.040]   Maybe not.
[01:31:13.040 --> 01:31:14.040]   Maybe I only had the keyboard and mouse.
[01:31:14.040 --> 01:31:16.400]   You should have the trackpad and sell it on eBay.
[01:31:16.400 --> 01:31:18.400]   That's how you make the whole rest of it.
[01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:20.200]   Hey, it's for the rest of it.
[01:31:20.200 --> 01:31:22.440]   Andy and I go, you're pick of the week.
[01:31:22.440 --> 01:31:29.400]   I got a really goofy iOS app that I really, really like that I stole from Flow Ions recommendation
[01:31:29.400 --> 01:31:30.400]   last week.
[01:31:30.400 --> 01:31:33.840]   I think on Android, on the Android show because I was watching her demonstrate it.
[01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:39.120]   It's a camera app called KDPro and it emulates an old timey codec disposable.
[01:31:39.120 --> 01:31:41.440]   Oh my God.
[01:31:41.440 --> 01:31:44.600]   And I love it.
[01:31:44.600 --> 01:31:48.000]   So it doesn't do anything good.
[01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:53.040]   It basically gives you all the cool, all the limitations that make photography interesting.
[01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:57.080]   Number one, you don't get the full screen viewfinder.
[01:31:57.080 --> 01:32:02.640]   You just get this little eyehole sort of, just like you're looking through like an eyehole
[01:32:02.640 --> 01:32:03.640]   viewfinder.
[01:32:03.640 --> 01:32:04.640]   You just get it.
[01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:08.840]   When you click the button, you have to actually operate a thumb wheel to advance to the next
[01:32:08.840 --> 01:32:09.840]   frame.
[01:32:09.840 --> 01:32:14.360]   Number three, there are only 24 frames on the on the roll.
[01:32:14.360 --> 01:32:17.440]   So as soon as you take 24, you're done.
[01:32:17.440 --> 01:32:19.440]   And it's not like, oh, I took a picture.
[01:32:19.440 --> 01:32:21.120]   Now let's go into Instagram.
[01:32:21.120 --> 01:32:24.560]   No, you have this mode you can turn on.
[01:32:24.560 --> 01:32:25.880]   I suggest you turn on.
[01:32:25.880 --> 01:32:28.360]   That gives you the full experience.
[01:32:28.360 --> 01:32:33.800]   Instead of getting the photos instantly, you can either pretend it's the 1990s and you
[01:32:33.800 --> 01:32:34.960]   have to wait one hour.
[01:32:34.960 --> 01:32:39.800]   So you've dropped an hour photo counter or another or another option like you can pretend
[01:32:39.800 --> 01:32:43.800]   it's 1980s and you have to wait a full day to get your pictures.
[01:32:43.800 --> 01:32:49.880]   You literally will not see your 24 pictures until 24 hours have elapsed.
[01:32:49.880 --> 01:32:55.000]   And you can also do like Lomo stuff like make like give me like lens distortion effects
[01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:58.000]   as a cheap plastic lens and have like light leaking in.
[01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:03.020]   You can even do have like on the old timey cameras, they'd have like a time and date
[01:33:03.020 --> 01:33:07.320]   stamp by having actual LEDs inside it that would actually burn the date and the time
[01:33:07.320 --> 01:33:08.320]   into it.
[01:33:08.320 --> 01:33:12.480]   So you can actually have time and date statement, but realize that it will actually be burned
[01:33:12.480 --> 01:33:13.480]   into the pixels.
[01:33:13.480 --> 01:33:17.320]   You will need Photoshop to get this time and date out of it.
[01:33:17.320 --> 01:33:19.400]   It's free for a buck.
[01:33:19.400 --> 01:33:23.680]   For a buck, you get rid of ads and there are a couple of extra simple features, but oh
[01:33:23.680 --> 01:33:24.960]   my goodness, it's so much fun.
[01:33:24.960 --> 01:33:32.000]   It's like there are times I don't collect vintage cameras or anything like that.
[01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:33.000]   Yeah.
[01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.640]   Where do you take the picture?
[01:33:35.640 --> 01:33:37.400]   Is there a button?
[01:33:37.400 --> 01:33:40.200]   Yeah, there's a, where is it?
[01:33:40.200 --> 01:33:41.200]   Hang on.
[01:33:41.200 --> 01:33:42.200]   Is it the top button?
[01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:47.560]   I think you're using the, yeah, hang on.
[01:33:47.560 --> 01:33:48.560]   Where my thumb is?
[01:33:48.560 --> 01:33:49.560]   Where am I?
[01:33:49.560 --> 01:33:50.560]   Yeah.
[01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:51.560]   Oh, okay.
[01:33:51.560 --> 01:33:53.720]   Oh yeah, I took two pictures that won't get for a day.
[01:33:53.720 --> 01:33:54.720]   Until tomorrow.
[01:33:54.720 --> 01:33:55.720]   These are the ways.
[01:33:55.720 --> 01:33:59.940]   And then you have to wind it with forced touch and you see, and you actually see the
[01:33:59.940 --> 01:34:01.920]   little counter at the bottom.
[01:34:01.920 --> 01:34:02.920]   Oh, MG.
[01:34:02.920 --> 01:34:08.080]   Now there are in at purchases, but I think this has got everything you never want.
[01:34:08.080 --> 01:34:13.680]   And it is fun because, again, I don't collect old cameras, but sometimes I will like, I
[01:34:13.680 --> 01:34:16.520]   have a couple of weird ones that I kind of like that are old.
[01:34:16.520 --> 01:34:20.120]   And sometimes I will like go to the expense of buying a roll of film because it's fun
[01:34:20.120 --> 01:34:24.680]   to walk around saying that, no, no, no, you have exactly 24 frames of film.
[01:34:24.680 --> 01:34:27.520]   On this, you have this one cartridge.
[01:34:27.520 --> 01:34:30.080]   Once you're done with this, you have no more pictures to take.
[01:34:30.080 --> 01:34:35.200]   If you see David Hasselhoff rescuing a child from a burning U-boat, you will not be able
[01:34:35.200 --> 01:34:38.200]   to take pictures of David Hasselhoff because you took all the pictures you could take with
[01:34:38.200 --> 01:34:39.200]   this.
[01:34:39.200 --> 01:34:41.360]   So it's just a lot of fun.
[01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:47.960]   It's a way for adults to explain to their kids how bad life might have been in the 1990s.
[01:34:47.960 --> 01:34:51.720]   And why there are so few pictures of their parents doing embarrassing things at parties
[01:34:51.720 --> 01:34:54.440]   because you would run out of pictures by the time you got that drunk.
[01:34:54.440 --> 01:34:57.520]   This is for his touch to wind it and actually clicks.
[01:34:57.520 --> 01:34:59.520]   That's so great.
[01:34:59.520 --> 01:35:00.760]   But you have to turn that on.
[01:35:00.760 --> 01:35:03.400]   You know, that's in the advanced features.
[01:35:03.400 --> 01:35:06.360]   Turn on the wine film manually and develop time.
[01:35:06.360 --> 01:35:07.360]   Yeah.
[01:35:07.360 --> 01:35:10.440]   So, you know, by default, I think all of those should be default.
[01:35:10.440 --> 01:35:11.440]   The wake rate.
[01:35:11.440 --> 01:35:12.440]   The wake rate.
[01:35:12.440 --> 01:35:13.440]   Or should be a default.
[01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:14.440]   I agree.
[01:35:14.440 --> 01:35:20.240]   They should go to the photo head on the 70s show to get them developed.
[01:35:20.240 --> 01:35:21.240]   Yeah.
[01:35:21.240 --> 01:35:24.320]   You actually remember a photo.
[01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:25.320]   Hutt.
[01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:26.320]   Aren't you a Rene Richie?
[01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:27.320]   Oh, I remember.
[01:35:27.320 --> 01:35:28.320]   I remember.
[01:35:28.320 --> 01:35:29.320]   Oh my God.
[01:35:29.320 --> 01:35:30.320]   Okay.
[01:35:30.320 --> 01:35:31.400]   Jenny picks the developers.
[01:35:31.400 --> 01:35:34.120]   This app I'm giving you the 2.0 feature.
[01:35:34.120 --> 01:35:38.840]   You want your I'm telling you you should create like a Pokemon go sort of thing where you designate
[01:35:38.840 --> 01:35:40.800]   on Google apps, Google maps.
[01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:42.440]   We're like 24 hour for.
[01:35:42.440 --> 01:35:47.160]   So you and only through AR to actually see the little chaos kiosk and only when you buy
[01:35:47.160 --> 01:35:52.680]   geolocation, you're within 50 yards of this place, can you actually drop off the film
[01:35:52.680 --> 01:35:56.480]   to be developed and then you only get them back when you go back to that location.
[01:35:56.480 --> 01:35:57.480]   You have to be in the mall.
[01:35:57.480 --> 01:36:01.040]   I remember when the mall got sent for more wonderful useless features.
[01:36:01.040 --> 01:36:03.440]   I remember when the mall got a one hour photo place.
[01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:04.440]   Leo, that was exciting.
[01:36:04.440 --> 01:36:06.440]   Oh, you do remember that.
[01:36:06.440 --> 01:36:07.440]   Okay.
[01:36:07.440 --> 01:36:09.920]   I'm just hoping that Jenny picks is actually a woman named Jenny.
[01:36:09.920 --> 01:36:11.840]   I'm just I wish it would be.
[01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:13.200]   I just hope it is.
[01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:14.200]   I hope so.
[01:36:14.200 --> 01:36:15.200]   That is awesome.
[01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:19.280]   Mine is not nearly as exciting and fun as you guys.
[01:36:19.280 --> 01:36:20.280]   You've got some fun stuff.
[01:36:20.280 --> 01:36:23.880]   I just have a tip really for people who use affinity photo.
[01:36:23.880 --> 01:36:30.240]   The company that does affinity photos, Serif is offering for a limited time some free stuff.
[01:36:30.240 --> 01:36:34.960]   So you got to go create a affinity photo account.
[01:36:34.960 --> 01:36:39.840]   If you don't already have one and then you can download for free the live filters macro
[01:36:39.840 --> 01:36:45.920]   pack the studio retouch brush pack and the luminance brush pack and add it to your affinity
[01:36:45.920 --> 01:36:46.920]   photos.
[01:36:46.920 --> 01:36:51.360]   I think this is only a few more days available but definitely take advantage of this because
[01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:54.640]   once you once you add it, you're going to get some nice features is kind of clever.
[01:36:54.640 --> 01:36:58.960]   They actually say open it and affinity photo and you have the new library catawax.
[01:36:58.960 --> 01:37:03.120]   If you cat it categories if you use affinity photo, which you should it's really amazing
[01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:04.120]   product.
[01:37:04.120 --> 01:37:07.560]   It's nice of Serif to offer this for free.
[01:37:07.560 --> 01:37:08.560]   Thank you, Serif.
[01:37:08.560 --> 01:37:09.480]   So great.
[01:37:09.480 --> 01:37:11.960]   We are out of time.
[01:37:11.960 --> 01:37:15.000]   Well not really but we're definitely show we're out of stories.
[01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:16.000]   How about that?
[01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:19.600]   Renee Richie is at imore.com gosh man he's doing great work.
[01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:23.080]   I hate to plug it but I know you're going to probably stop listening to us and start
[01:37:23.080 --> 01:37:25.920]   listening to imore.com/vector the great vector.
[01:37:25.920 --> 01:37:26.920]   It's so short though Leo.
[01:37:26.920 --> 01:37:28.280]   That's a nice thing is it's super short.
[01:37:28.280 --> 01:37:29.680]   Right back to Mac break.
[01:37:29.680 --> 01:37:32.000]   Yeah, which is not.
[01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:35.400]   All sorts of great useful stuff and now with video.
[01:37:35.400 --> 01:37:36.400]   Yeah.
[01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:37.880]   Good job Renee.
[01:37:37.880 --> 01:37:39.360]   Congratulations.

[01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:15.400]   Is that a new?
[01:38:15.400 --> 01:38:16.640]   Did you coin that?
[01:38:16.640 --> 01:38:17.640]   I liked it.
[01:38:17.640 --> 01:38:22.880]   When I'm embarrassed by talking about, well embarrassed by what I'm talking about because
[01:38:22.880 --> 01:38:23.880]   it's so serving.
[01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:24.880]   Yes.
[01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:25.880]   Sometimes.
[01:38:25.880 --> 01:38:26.880]   Flog roll.
[01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:27.880]   I'm going to flog roll.
