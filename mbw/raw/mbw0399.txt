[00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.700]   I just leave on during the entire show upstairs on watch so that I don't
[00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.400]   have to wait for the colors to warm back up when I come back three hours
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.700]   later.
[00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.900]   I've not turned it off but I put it on screen saver mode.
[00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.200]   So you sir are a great American.
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.900]   I'm just given guy a big old hug today.
[00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.400]   A great citizen of the world.
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.400]   Also with us from Canada from Montreal home of the better bagel.
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.800]   Mr. Renee Richie and smoke.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.900]   If I'd known it was Earth Daily I would have put a giant green leaf on my head.
[00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.300]   Oh it's not Earth Day in Canada.
[00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.200]   Canada like everything else they're doing it 15 days later.
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.800]   We have to wait for the thaw.
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.000]   Yeah we can do Earth Day when it's still permafrost.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.600]   Actually I think it is Earth Day in Canada.
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.500]   I went to Whole Food this morning and of course at Whole Food I didn't I
[00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.100]   wasn't thinking that it was Earth Day except that I saw the Google Doodle that
[00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.200]   has a bird and then I must be Earth Day.
[00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.900]   But I went to Whole Food and they're all wanting funny hats.
[00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.500]   That's how they're commemorating Earth Day.
[00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.900]   That's a funny hat Earth Day.
[00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.200]   So funny hat day.
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.000]   No it's Earth Day.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.200]   Oh now I get it.
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.700]   Well hello everybody welcome.
[00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:16.300]   That's my favorite opening comment from Leo on a show reading the show.
[00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.300]   It's like oh boy.
[00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.100]   Anybody story from the weekend we could talk about.
[00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.100]   There is you got a movie clip anything.
[00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.600]   There is so nothing.
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.300]   No no.
[00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.500]   Some cool things happen this over the weekend.
[00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.300]   We got a new Apple TV update.
[00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.000]   So it's good to see it's good to see some some new channels there.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.500]   Oh okay I didn't know that that's good.
[00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.900]   Okay.
[00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.300]   Yeah I just added that that's that just dropped yesterday.
[00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.900]   I just added that.
[00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.700]   What's what's in that new Apple TV?
[00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.800]   Now you got your A&E channel now you got your history channel now you got your
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:49.600]   lifetime channel.
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.400]   So they made it added channels.
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.200]   Exactly.
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.000]   So you get so Tim Gunn arriving on the Apple TV to me that is that has to be a big
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.300]   update.
[00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.500]   That has to be a valuable upgrade right.
[00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.600]   And some of these were actually apps that were available on Roku.
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.100]   But given that you don't have the option of adding things manually to the Apple TV
[00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:10.400]   any more content is more content is more valuable stuff before you jump up.
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.700]   Enjoy and and satisfaction.
[00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.200]   You should know that even though the Apple TV has lifetime A&E in the history
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.600]   channel you can only watch it if you are a subscriber of direct TV Verizon
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.200]   files or cable vision optimum.
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.200]   Yeah.
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.200]   So I'm a Comcast customer.
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.000]   I see those.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.400]   I see those icons press the button.
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.000]   It says great login.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.800]   Oh sorry your XFINITY.
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:33.600]   We can't help you.
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.600]   Yeah.
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.400]   You like to add more providers eventually please be patient and just ignore this icon for now.
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.000]   Who is that?
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.500]   Is that the is that Comcast not making a deal with the history channel?
[00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.500]   Is it Apple not making a deal with Comcast?
[00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:54.500]   What's the who how why yeah I happen to know somebody who was an executive in the cable industry
[00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:59.300]   throughout the 90s and I and he left to preserve his sanity and I tried.
[00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.200]   I tried to ask him a couple of years ago about what is going to have to happen.
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:10.000]   And he basically explained it to me that a lot of it is really a case of executives in place right now
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.100]   simply don't like this don't like the the business model of Internet TV.
[00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.700]   They don't want the business model of Internet TV.
[00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:21.600]   They're making so much money off of the old business model that there's just no pressure on them to actually change.
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:28.100]   And so he feels as though a lot of people are going to have to retire out of the system and you're going to get the first generation of people who grew up.
[00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.400]   Yes.
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:40.400]   Or really are relying on this this mode of television because I mean you think about the amount of pushback to some really great ideas coincidentally I think today's today or yesterday is the day probably today is the day that the areas.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.600]   Today between yeah arguments.
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:43.400]   Yes.
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:43.700]   Yes.
[00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:48.300]   Her between the networks and the cable companies in the Supreme Court to defend the idea that.
[00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:53.500]   Two that the area of service is going to be should be legal and should be allowed to proceed.
[00:05:53.500 --> 00:06:01.300]   And this is a fight that Ariel has wanted for so long that they didn't they could have gone through intermediate courts to get there.
[00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:08.500]   But as soon as the cable company said we want to we want to be heard from the Supreme Court area said bring it on because we've been winning and we've been winning.
[00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:16.100]   We've had a couple of losses but we want the Supreme Court to basically allow us to run rough shot over the entire country and it's such a great service.
[00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:28.000]   It's so well in tune with the way that people would want to watch TV from now on the ability to simply stream any local channel to pretty much any studly device they have that I really think I'm really fighting for.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:37.800]   I think I think it's something that consumers really really should win because I'm always on the side of the consumers and this is just holding the service back is not something that is that people.
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.300]   It's going to be in their best interest. Sorry for the suffering.
[00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.100]   So three fifty four.
[00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:54.300]   Sebelius Secretary of Health and Human Services versus listening now right now to the Supreme Court of the United States of America versus.
[00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:55.900]   Beleus Mr Clement.
[00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:57.000]   Oye.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:57.700]   Oye.
[00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:58.200]   Oye.
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:59.300]   Actually I love it.
[00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:00.900]   I wonder if you said that this morning.
[00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:01.500]   No.
[00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:04.500]   That's my favorite part of the whole thing.
[00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:11.500]   So if you go to this is this is these are our oral arguments from March twenty fifth.
[00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.600]   On a stoga woodspend corporation.
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.900]   Sebelius versus the hobby lobby stores.
[00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:18.900]   That was a big case.
[00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:20.100]   Oh man.
[00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:32.600]   It's it's it's pretty this one's pretty interesting because one justice had recuse himself for reasons that they didn't explain which means that it's an eight justice panel and if it if it goes across party lines.
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.200]   If it's a tie the the wind goes to a Rio.
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:38.500]   So it's it's going to be interesting it.
[00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.300]   Same thing happened.
[00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:43.300]   They just did a decision this morning.
[00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:56.300]   I got it and the first the Wall Street Journal said it was seven or two and they said whoops no six to two because a judge recused him or herself as well on the number with that one was so we won't we won't hear a decision. These are oral arguments now.
[00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:57.600]   Right.
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:58.500]   Is that right.
[00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:59.800]   Right.
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:11.400]   So I don't I don't know what the timetable is but it's not going to be a good movie style ending it's going to take a while for the curriculum and then and then when they when they write the decision that's what we're going to figure out exactly what what we'll bring people have.
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:29.600]   But the this is this is almost like apple Samsung in terms of acrimony we've had network say that CBS said that well if very old wins this we're going to take as we're not going to be a broadcast network anymore we're going to go to cable so go to hell and Fox and other networks have said well if you have very old wins this case.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.700]   We're not going to be broadcasting the World Series on free TV.
[00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:35.800]   We're going to put it like yeah it's pretty pretty.
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:53.000]   Which is both pathetic and also they make so much money off of certain stuff transmissions that this is this is like this is like you know the little kids say well if I don't get cake and since the cake for dinner I'm going to leave and never come back and the mom says okay.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:10.600]   So if you go to supreme court.gov you I presume in a couple of weeks you'll be able to hear the oral arguments that are going on right now for the area case and there is also OEA.org OYZ.org which is from the Chicago
[00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:19.200]   Kent College of Law University of Chicago Kent College of Law and they do have a little bit of video with one of their professors at IIT Chicago
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:23.600]   Kent College of Law explaining the ins and outs of this case.
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:27.600]   So this is a big case for everybody who's watching.
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:40.000]   I mean this is you know it reminds me so much Andy of the music industry where the executives in the music industry 10 years ago basically I was told this by somebody in the music industry.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.500]   They just said we know it's we know it's going to happen.
[00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:44.300]   We know copy protection is dead.
[00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:46.000]   We know that everything is going to be digital.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.100]   We know all this is going to happen.
[00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:53.600]   We just don't want to have it happen on our watch and we're just going to sit here and with every penny out there.
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:10:06.900]   Just keep it the way it is as long as we can then retire and then as you said the younger guys are going to get gals are going to come in who have a little bit more vision and and this log jam will break.
[00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:08.800]   Meanwhile your Apple TV.
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:11.500]   This isn't the big running.
[00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:13.300]   This is not the big update we've been expecting.
[00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:16.500]   This is just no no this is just the channels they do this all the time they come to partnership.
[00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:19.500]   We didn't get those channels in Canada but it's an international issue.
[00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:32.300]   We had an app on the I to on the iOS app store for each of our network CTV global city TV and CBC and they were great that you could just basically watch any show and then why little.
[00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:42.000]   No it was on the next day but you could watch them on demand and little by little they've just been ruined first they went to only three episodes because they realized that stacking prevented them from having.
[00:10:42.500 --> 00:11:06.500]   Replay replay rights and territory replay rights then they lock the last two episodes unless you subscribe to the cable company but in Canada every network is owned by a distributor Rogers own Shaw right global zone global zone is owned by Bell and no sorry CTV zone by Bell and global zone by Shaw and you can only subscribe using the networks that owns them which is ridiculous and none of them are owned by a Quebec company so you can't get any of them in Quebec.
[00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:10.800]   Which is why cable company should not own the companies that make the content.
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:23.300]   No and they turned off airplay was working beautifully and all of them they crippled airplay no longer works on it and they those apps have now become almost unusable and it's going to take an extinction level event before you know or some young upstart to to really push this aside.
[00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:36.000]   Some of this also I would bet has to do with you you kind of said it the agreements that they've made for rights with the production companies that made the content and so forth that they're older agreements and those agreements don't include the product.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.600]   Don't include this kind of streaming etc etc etc etc.
[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:59.200]   I forget if someone was explaining that even in a case of Comcast and NBC when it's owned by the same company the studio will refuse the right like the broadcast the distribution company will want to distribute the shows they'll want to stack them by Netflix but the studio will not because they get repeat rights and they get money for all these different versions of the same program.
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:05.400]   Did you see the Netflix ad I saw this morning. Oh I love the Netflix ad.
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:09.400]   Actually I guess it's not a new ad let me see if I can find it here.
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:10.800]   I love them yelling at Comcast.
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.400]   This is it this is it.
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:15.000]   Can you get my can you get my audio.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.800]   What.
[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:21.400]   Oh I believe that just happened.
[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:23.400]   I cannot believe that just happened.
[00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:25.800]   This was going to be our thing.
[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:26.600]   What are you doing?
[00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:28.200]   You watched ahead.
[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:29.200]   No.
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:33.200]   Okay I've watched it on my way to work.
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:37.200]   Got some episodes at my desk and I started season two when you were sleeping.
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.200]   Season two.
[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:45.200]   That's a conversation had in my house as a matter of fact.
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:47.200]   That's what I love.
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:51.200]   You can do that and yeah I understand they don't have the agreements they don't.
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:54.200]   Well I'm with consumer interest imagine that.
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:57.900]   But it's such a great ad because it really is totally identifiable.
[00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:00.000]   That's why we love Netflix.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.280]   Why we like House of Cards because we can.
[00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:07.720]   And they have a good sense not to really season two until after we hit all season one.
[00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:09.520]   One hopes.
[00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:10.520]   It's so much.
[00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:15.200]   Isn't this funny this is even this happens a lot but it's really notable how the interests
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:20.560]   of the consumers the people are buying the content are so unaligned with the people who
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:22.360]   make it and distributed.
[00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:30.680]   Well that's why I think this area of decision I hope they win is such a big deal because
[00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:35.640]   cable vision got the right to use DVRs but that also got the original cable vision of
[00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:40.320]   Verdict from the Supreme Court that established that if you are just providing the hardware
[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:44.600]   that someone can use to take the recording that they have a right to and streaming it
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:47.480]   to another place that's not rebroadcasting.
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:51.200]   That's the basic principle that one of the basic principles that area was founded upon.
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:55.560]   But if Ariel can win this that means that they've essentially paid all the money to settle
[00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:59.440]   this legal issue and that will give a lot of other companies the freedom to produce
[00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:00.440]   stuff like this.
[00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:06.400]   I also hope that it will provoke networks to find a way to say well look if other companies
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:10.600]   we're not going to this is now legal we cannot stop that now.
[00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:13.840]   Well we can do is make sure that we're the guys who are getting the money for this service
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:16.280]   as opposed to funding other startups.
[00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:22.080]   So maybe we'll start to create a CBS app or an ABC or an NBC app that streams pretty much
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:24.120]   everything the entire feed.
[00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:28.480]   But as when I said there's just so many legal agreements that ties between the network
[00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:32.600]   network own shows producers and independent networks local networks that I appreciate
[00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:37.480]   that might be a lot simpler than simply having the desire to do it or having a 31 year old
[00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:43.240]   executive finally getting it and then flipping a switch on this kind of service.
[00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:45.960]   It seems pretty obvious when you refer to the cable vision case that was the case where
[00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:50.880]   a company was doing a DVR in this cloud.
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:54.880]   So just actually which is what area it does as well where you could say hey I want you
[00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:59.560]   to record this for me and the Supreme Court ruled positively on that.
[00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:03.640]   Right but the networks have the exact same disagreement they said that no no no you're
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:07.080]   rebroadcasting this content and you're not allowed to rebroadcast.
[00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:13.640]   Supreme Court said that no this is a hardware this is a service that the customer who streams
[00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:20.600]   their DVR show is has a right to that recording because of the way that the law is right now.
[00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:24.800]   It's not being there the the cable company is not creating the recording it is the user
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:28.800]   who's creating the recording on cable equipment and the only person who is able to actually
[00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:33.560]   receive that is the subscriber to that DVR service and so one two three means that this
[00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:36.000]   is not a rebroadcast.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.400]   You know and that's I mean I'm no lawyer and well I'm sure they'll talk about it on
[00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:43.600]   this weekend law but it seems to me like well okay that proves it's okay for area to
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:50.120]   do what it's doing but I do know that this current Supreme Court seems to rule very strongly
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:54.600]   in favor of incumbent businesses and not so much in favor of upstarts.
[00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:59.800]   What we need is an antenna on Apple Compass 2 for every American.
[00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:01.800]   So we all get Cupertino TV.
[00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:07.720]   Right but again that's why this this eight justice panel is so interesting because again
[00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:12.880]   if it the the the rulings that tend to favor business over the over consumers and the public
[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:19.560]   interest tend to be going five four so if that is sort of a I want to say political division
[00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:24.400]   but at least an ideological division now it could be a four four decision and once again
[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:28.320]   if it's if it's a tie essentially area wins as far as I understand.
[00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:31.560]   We don't know which justice recues herself or himself.
[00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:34.960]   We do add a storm member they didn't they didn't say were the reasons why they recues
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:37.040]   themselves that's the only error of mystery.
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:41.760]   Okay I mean this I think is as important as the beta max case as important as the cable
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:45.880]   vision case this is a big case we'll watch with great interest and I'm with you.
[00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:49.120]   I deeply hope that the Supreme Court does the right thing.
[00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:56.240]   Yeah it's really interesting to because Ariel it's clear that part of their business plan
[00:16:56.240 --> 00:17:00.960]   is and here is the forty here is the sixty percent of our operating expenses and investment
[00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:05.200]   we're going to be spending on the big lawsuit that's definitely going to happen because
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:10.040]   about a year ago they may they announced really ambitious plans city by city by city to expand
[00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:13.840]   the service and those were put on hold they're supposed to be expanding.
[00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:17.040]   Right now it's the northeast and parts of the Midwest they've gotten Boston they've gotten
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:21.840]   Chicago but it was supposed to expand into other New England states and other midwestern
[00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:27.760]   states by the end of last year and that basically put a put a whole kibosh on that so if they
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:31.840]   win I think it's going to be about a week before the suppress release from Ariel saying
[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:37.400]   good news Dayton Ohio you're going to be getting Ariel soon.
[00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:43.680]   The justice I think I found it here apparently the justice that recuse himself did so because
[00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:50.320]   he has stock in one of the plaintiffs let me see here.
[00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:52.800]   I've got an old New Yorker article that should.
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:55.000]   Bob Comcast after a reason Bob.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:02.040]   Bob Justice Alito recuse himself from the petition decision possibly because of his stock
[00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:06.040]   holdings which suggests he may recuse himself from the case.
[00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:11.320]   Alito is one of the justices that does support incumbents over up starts so that might be
[00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:19.080]   good might be a vote out of the out of the pot that would be against area.
[00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:26.600]   But watch with interest I'm sure.
[00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:31.360]   And when we're going to see an apple is apple okay apples probably saying well let's see
[00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:35.400]   what happens there because wouldn't it be great to do a deal with Ariel.
[00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:37.280]   Well TV and area that would be amazing.
[00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:40.200]   An area where they don't have to deal they don't have to deal with all the agreements
[00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:43.920]   they'd have to do to get all these license agreements in place.
[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:48.120]   You got to think there's an engineer in a closet in Cupertino who's got it working right.
[00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:51.920]   They've already got they've got already got an Ariel app on Roku and it works brilliantly.
[00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:56.640]   Yeah so an area is initially came out on I pedal it was an iPad app so I don't think
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.640]   this is a challenge at all.
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:18:59.640]   Yeah.
[00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:03.960]   And imagine I mean Ariel has not only the ability to watch TV now you have to live in that city
[00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:04.960]   right.
[00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:05.960]   Exactly.
[00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:10.680]   They were really really careful to make sure they crossed their eyes and dot their T's
[00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:12.920]   with all the legal stuff here.
[00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:13.920]   They don't mean that.
[00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:17.320]   They dotted the eyes and crossed the T's but thank you.
[00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:22.040]   See it's always a big risk to make a joke like that because hopefully people will understand
[00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:23.040]   that you did that on purpose.
[00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:24.040]   Yes.
[00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:26.040]   As opposed to you really doesn't know what the.
[00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:27.720]   Isn't that a crisis.
[00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:32.680]   I once made a binomial theorem joke to people who have like PhD's and math and my god the
[00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:36.160]   relief I have no he really does know what the binomial theorem is.
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:37.640]   He was trying to be funny for it.
[00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:39.360]   It's a math joke.
[00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:42.680]   But yeah I mean there are heaps of restrictions on how you can use the service.
[00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:47.880]   It really is only there to reproduce what you would be able to do if you were had an old
[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:49.680]   fashioned TV with a set of rabbit ears.
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:53.440]   If Ariel gets in every Metro I mean here in Petaluma for instance I think we're technically
[00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:56.280]   in the San Francisco Metro but I can't get any of those stations.
[00:19:56.280 --> 00:20:02.280]   If I could have rented in a tenant in San Francisco I wouldn't need would need Comcast.
[00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:03.280]   Right.
[00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:04.280]   That's exactly why there people.
[00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:09.200]   But you can't do this like Boston has Ariel Chicago has Ariel so if I were to spend a
[00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:12.960]   weekend in Chicago that doesn't mean that I can get access to the DVR content that I
[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:14.120]   recorded in Boston.
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:19.680]   I can get access to whatever live TV is streaming in Chicago because of that.
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:22.680]   Oh that you said so the interesting that I didn't understand that because I have watched
[00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:31.200]   Long Island I mean New York television in Petaluma on somebody who had Ariel in Manhattan and
[00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:35.880]   had her iPad here and she said here you want to see Ariel and that did work.
[00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:40.320]   It's not you're saying it monitors where you are and will not allow you to watch DVR
[00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:42.440]   content if you're not in town.
[00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:45.640]   I've tried to I've tried that earlier and it didn't work.
[00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:47.080]   Oh I mean that's good.
[00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:51.520]   But and also because it's been explained to me that again if they were to allow you to
[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:57.640]   be in San Jose and watch TV from someplace else then that is not rabbit ears style reaction.
[00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:02.640]   No that makes sense.
[00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:06.920]   I'm at the point where I have to basically look at all my notes from like about a year
[00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:11.920]   ago but there really is a complicated system where it's simple if you're in your actual
[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:15.440]   reception area it's complicated if you're outside of your reception area because again
[00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:21.200]   as soon as someone as soon as a network can make the case that you're letting people watch
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:25.680]   TV that they're not entitled to actually watch that's when the whole thing starts to go
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:26.680]   prefluey.
[00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:29.600]   Oh oh and they're playing blocks it.
[00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:34.360]   Anna Marie Cox just tweeted I guess a transcript from the ongoing conversation.
[00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:36.800]   Justice Scalia what would the difference be?
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:42.680]   I mean you could take HBO right you could carry that without performing Mr. Justice.
[00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:45.520]   No HBO is not over the air.
[00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:48.120]   It's a it's a private service Mr. Justice.
[00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:50.960]   They don't watch TV folks.
[00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:57.760]   Well they're big time torners you know there's also they're still watching Falcon cress.
[00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:02.280]   Justice Scalia says no about that red wedding.
[00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:10.760]   Wow we'll keep book so I guess there this is a this is coming out bit by bit from reporters.
[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:12.880]   Justice Scalia what would the difference be?
[00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:15.360]   I mean you could take HBO you could carry that without performing.
[00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:18.560]   No HBO is not over the airwaves.
[00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:26.560]   We see when you hear stuff like this but I should caution people you cannot and I've
[00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:30.960]   this seen this before you can't really judge how this is going from the oral arguments because
[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:35.000]   justices take all sorts of positions and they're really trying to challenge the attorneys
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.880]   but they may not feel one way or the other but cross your fingers here.
[00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:40.880]   Cross your fingers on this one.
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:44.880]   If Apple so that would be one reason Apple might wait on Apple TV.
[00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:45.880]   Let's see what happens.
[00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:51.480]   The other is I presume they're ongoing conversations with Comcast right.
[00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:58.600]   Although those are obviously non starters but Apple seems to keep going back pulling
[00:22:58.600 --> 00:22:59.600]   the threads.
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:02.440]   They have a tense interest.
[00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:09.520]   Yeah okay so would you say one should not hold out for our new Apple TV.
[00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:13.400]   I'd still like an SDK for WWDC I think that'd be a nice gift for everybody.
[00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:19.880]   I mean I've been spending more time with Apple TV specifically because I've spent two months
[00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:24.400]   not using Apple TV at all so make sure that I've got I've still got like my I understand
[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:27.760]   exactly how well it works and what it does and what it doesn't do because sometimes the
[00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:33.400]   streams get crossed a little bit and man am I hurting back to go back to the Roku or
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:40.120]   even the fire TV because I never realized how often my Apple TV insists that I wait for
[00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:46.520]   something before I I've never see a progress progress wheel on any of the streaming boxes
[00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:52.080]   but it seems like nothing starts in the Apple TV before a you know I shut up and wait here's
[00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:56.600]   a black screen enjoy this meditate on the on the guru meditation deal and that's what
[00:23:56.600 --> 00:24:03.280]   you got an Apple Apple doesn't keep something on the price list if they are ready to abandon
[00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:06.480]   it they will just simply cut that cut that cord and there there've been so many times
[00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:10.960]   when we've just not seen a lot of movement on a certain product and then it's because
[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:16.680]   it's just not a high priority but at some point they produce this huge update to it that
[00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:20.200]   that where it's it's like two years worth of incremental updates that the hit all at
[00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:23.920]   once I'm sure that's what's going to happen with Apple TV it's way too valuable a product
[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:28.920]   Walt Mossberg says Apple is like a movie studio we'll find out what the hell he's talking
[00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:36.200]   about just a second it's actually basically an apology an apology for Apple from recode
[00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:40.520]   hey speaking of recode have you guys been watching Silicon Valley the TV show I have
[00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:47.720]   not I have not can you not can you not get it in Canadian I'm probably the Canadian HBO
[00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:51.880]   might have it but I don't know what channels in on Leo HBO okay maybe how to look right
[00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:58.320]   after G.O.T. you got Silicon Valley it's a comedy by Mike judge the beavis and butthead
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:05.600]   and more important more to the point office space guy and I really like it and apparently
[00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:13.760]   Twit made a fair reminder appearance in the third episode thanks to can I say his name
[00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:19.200]   you think chatter this won't get him in trouble no I don't think so no Eric Nelson who's a
[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:26.960]   VFX artist it's not like it was absurd for a company yeah yeah he he's a fan of Twits
[00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:31.840]   and in the third episode it's actually a very funny scene do we have the do we have a not
[00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:37.520]   the video but I wonder if we have the image I think he sent us the image didn't he yeah
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:44.640]   let me see here here it is in the third episode they're reading about the plot is that there's
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:52.240]   this young guy doing a startup called Pied Piper and then he's living in an incubator
[00:25:52.240 --> 00:26:04.160]   and this real I want to use a bad word bad guy dim wad who is his landlord and 10% owner
[00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:11.960]   of this company gives interviews to all the big tech things about the company in a very
[00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:15.600]   inappropriate way and but what's interesting is apparently in the script it called for
[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:22.640]   him giving an interview to Cara Swisher in all things D and so Mike Eric who knows a
[00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:26.480]   little bit better said no no it's it's recode now so I was I was I'm watching the show and
[00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:32.280]   all of a sudden I see there's recode a Cara Swisher fake Cara Swisher article but then
[00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:38.680]   look if you look really closely I don't you probably can't but and I missed it so there's
[00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:45.360]   three tabs there there's the Verge is the second tab what's the third tab Twit nice I thought
[00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:49.440]   that was I mean I would never have seen it I doubt anybody else did but he said well I
[00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:54.000]   first of all I thought we should make it recode and then second and I did mention that I guess
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.680]   and then a second of all put a twit in there he said we'll try to get you in the third season
[00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:05.360]   too as an Easter egg yeah I like that I like that well it's it's important that they couldn't
[00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:09.680]   like actually incorporate you guys in the script because it's not as though you have production level
[00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:15.280]   broadcast quality studio able to stream like that I mean it would take a visionary show
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:21.520]   to see that opportunity there HBO might not be that show I was just so thrilled because I it's
[00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:26.480]   actually if you guys get a chance to see it's very very good shows very funny and as you can tell
[00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:31.120]   it's authentic I mean yes you know I was kind of like I get this little freeze on when they said
[00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:36.800]   look Cara Swisher just wrote about it and recode I went what really whoa that's very authentic so
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:41.760]   that's neat that's nice I liked it anyway thank you Eric for sneaking us in there that's good did
[00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:46.960]   she write about that experience because I would if if I were approached like that I would like
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:51.440]   okay but I have to write the fake copy because I won't have you I won't have you having a lead
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:58.320]   paragraph with the leads off with a word so or right so right so this is the night
[00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:03.760]   or an apple is doomed headline I have to say I didn't write that I didn't even fake write that
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:10.160]   word just in from the Los Angeles Times Justice Alito did not recuse himself
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:19.360]   so fears of a 4 4 tie on the area case are unfounded all nine judges are sitting on the case
[00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:25.120]   damn and blessed yeah actually I'm on it's unfortunate who wins in a tie
[00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:34.400]   uh usually defendant I was I was reading about this a couple of weeks ago to prepare for the
[00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:38.800]   for it and uh that's that's when they were speculating there would be that there would
[00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:44.480]   be a recusement and that if it were a tie that basically would go to ario but he recuses himself
[00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:48.000]   and he's creating anything with the law or or engine maintenance I have to have
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.880]   have data in front of me to read off of to make sure that I remember everything's correct
[00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:58.880]   well anyway he's there
[00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:04.800]   Los mele times does mention that for the record an earlier version of this post referred to
[00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:12.320]   Justice Samuel Alito as Thomas Alito we apologize for the error you recuse himself
[00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:19.040]   he Thomas is not on the case just so you know a tie refers backwards to the lower court ruling
[00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:23.200]   so of course the Supreme Court only hears these things on appeal or mostly only hears the
[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:27.760]   modbular our cases where it would here be the first to hear a case but in this case it's an
[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:36.080]   appeal so it would basically uh uh basically an approval of the lower court ruling which was
[00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:45.520]   in favor of ario I don't know so complicated I don't remember who appealed this
[00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:53.120]   uh let me see if I can find this area's been largely winning there was one big loss in Denver
[00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:57.040]   but the because yeah but yeah okay so they won this the court of appeals for the second circuit
[00:29:57.040 --> 00:30:01.920]   in New York sided with ario and it is that decision the judges are trying to overturn
[00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:08.240]   so a tie would be in arios favor so Alito uh sitting uh sitting back in Thomas or Samuel
[00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:12.160]   is bad is bad for business uh good for the networks
[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:19.280]   every oh every oh every hill every oh our show today brought to you by the guys who brought us

[00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:10.480]   Um yeah I I am trailing dandreper because he's my personal hero even though he is about the worst
[00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:19.360]   human alive. And he's my 50s guru. While Mossberg who has I asked uh Liz Gaines when she was
[00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:24.000]   on the other day is Walt Rice writing less she said no he didn't you know he didn't wall is not
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:28.480]   what you call you know a blogger in the sense that he files several stories a days he says he
[00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:33.840]   does think pieces he does personal technology reviews he wrote uh today published an article
[00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:42.080]   uh about apple while apple why apple is like a movie studio he says you know and this isn't a
[00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:47.360]   response of course to this kind of drum beat that apple better have a hit apple better had a hit
[00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:53.200]   has apple lost its greatness is it you know over at you know is it the haunted empire blah blah blah
[00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:59.200]   um he says the most useful way to think about apple is to see it as a movie studio studios release
[00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:06.000]   blockbuster franchise movies every few years and then try to live off a series of sequels until the
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:14.240]   next big successful franchise uh then he's something about spider-man and then he says look at in this
[00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:20.320]   way you're almost new iPhone 5s and iPad air their mirrors sequels iterations of apple block
[00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:25.280]   busters that rock the world when they first appeared but you should not assume that because
[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:33.440]   they are kind of you know like spider-man 2 um that they are the end of the line for apple he says
[00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:37.280]   sometimes as with the godfather part 2 the sequel is considered to be better than the original
[00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:44.000]   sometimes as in godfather part 3 it's not sequels can make more money sometimes much much more
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:51.280]   than the original this has been true of apples follow on ipods iPhones and ipads um but after
[00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:55.520]   a while audience interest in sequel wanes competitors come up with a luring new things
[00:34:55.520 --> 00:35:00.400]   then you'd better have a whole new franchise because you cannot live forever on sequels jobs
[00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:05.360]   understood as well by the way what we should mention was fairly close to steve at the end
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:10.720]   uh it's one reason why he maintained a drum beat of game changers over a dozen years from the iMac
[00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:17.680]   to the ipad that rocked his competitors and upended other industries as well and that's why apples
[00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:23.600]   like a movie studio steve built it that way and i guess given that steve also ran a real movie
[00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:30.640]   studio pixar that makes a lot of sense um cook has done just enough the way i just want to point
[00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:40.480]   out that won't cause steve jobs mr jobs he calls tim cook cook okay don't just say cook has done
[00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:45.440]   just enough to keep his sequels appealing i still believe that when you combine hardware
[00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:51.520]   software and the ecosystem the ipad iphone i'm sorry iphone ipad and macbook air remain best in class
[00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:57.200]   cook has had some dangerous moments that did him no favors the awful quality of the initial
[00:35:57.200 --> 00:36:04.800]   maps service the more recent self-rebooting bug on ios 7 yeah uh high quality reliability
[00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:10.000]   can't be taken lightly so he he goes on he says sequel time's almost up it's time for a new
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:16.160]   franchise he does not weigh in on whether apple will have another blockbuster but he says now is
[00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:22.800]   the time it may be that you know the watch the wearable it may be mobile payments it may be
[00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:29.200]   he mentions apple tv this could this one could be a real franchise but if apple settles for just
[00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:34.160]   something too much akin to its current tv product it might just be a sequel sometime in the next six
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:39.600]   to eight months he concludes i expect we'll see if cook that cook fellow that guy won't go on walks
[00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:47.680]   with me walled they're either they're both mr or than their needers anyway we'll see if cook is the
[00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:53.120]   kind of producer who grinds out too many sequels or the kind who brings forth an original godfather
[00:36:53.120 --> 00:37:02.320]   or spider-man your thoughts uh it felt like a bit of a stretch i mean it's it was it was an
[00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:08.560]   entertaining read but it's always apples not unique in the idea that when they have a successful product
[00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:13.200]   they try to leverage people's like of that product and keeping improving it improving it the first
[00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:17.600]   version of anything kind of stinks and so you don't really cancel something after one iteration
[00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:21.440]   unless it's you know the apple hi-fi something that people don't want don't like i think that's
[00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:26.080]   really an important point that it isn't at all like the movie studio that movie sequels are almost
[00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:30.240]   always worse than the original because you're making something you know taking an idea stretching
[00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:37.120]   back say again berserk speck godfather part two yeah part two okay empire strikes back really
[00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:42.160]   better than the original sounds and lamps okay okay there are few exceptions that are notable
[00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:46.960]   listen to a nerd movie but they're notable because they're exceptions right matrix uh
[00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:54.480]   rocky two three four five six oglue electric boogaloo okay but in technology sequels are almost always
[00:37:54.480 --> 00:38:00.720]   better because at just as you say you have a chance to refine improve learn from the customer
[00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:08.720]   so i that's i would throw this mr mr mr mott walt muzberg i know tim kudal i don't you all know tim book
[00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:14.800]   i don't i don't know that it merits a craig virgson style terrap the blue sheet throw it behind your
[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:20.000]   back but i mean it's it's it's it's a good piece in that it's something that the people really
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:25.440]   for stupid reasons have to be reminded of that the fact that apple has not blown your mind and
[00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:29.440]   five and five years or four years doesn't mean that they're resting on the lawyers if they
[00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:34.880]   it's it's part of the success of producing something great is that you get to keep producing that
[00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:39.600]   great thing that everybody loves and also would you really love it if every three or four years
[00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:43.600]   apple completely changed their desktop strategy so that everything you've learned everything
[00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:47.920]   you've mastered over three or four years is now out the window or even worse that now there's
[00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:52.240]   nobody you can actually call for help because nobody has more than two or three years worth
[00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:58.000]   of expertise in any apple product so it's it reminds me of that that famous you know that that
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.600]   jet Bartlett speech one of the next ten words those first ten words are easy apple needs a new
[00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:05.360]   hit product right tell me what it is tell me what it is right now and i'll ask you to become the
[00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:09.520]   CEO of apple but making you know the iphone is boring should they make it a triangle with a
[00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:14.240]   triangular iphone be better for you less boring it's just it's one of those refrains that gets
[00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:18.640]   mashed up a batch of over and over again and it's i think it's almost mind-numbing at this point
[00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:24.400]   and i really don't think technology follows that same pattern i really don't um you know what
[00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:29.680]   happens is a technology gets mature and then you can only make incremental improvements
[00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:36.480]   because to do otherwise is to change something that is refined mature and nice uh windows 8-1
[00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:43.600]   would be or windows 8 would be a good example of what not to do to a mature solid product but
[00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:47.360]   again like what is that product is a watch does not have the addressable market of a phone uh
[00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:51.920]   right a television set does not have the margins of a phone a payment system can make a lot of money
[00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:55.920]   for apple but it's not a sexy front-facing consumer product that you it's more like an
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:40:01.920]   iTunes play it's not an iPod play so it's it's really hard the the iphone was a confluence of so many
[00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:06.480]   different things that it's hard to see anything else being that big and that valuable for any
[00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:10.960]   company and i joked on twitter over the week that what what what should have apple should apple
[00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:15.200]   have taken all their iphone profits and bought xon i mean that there's very few things that make
[00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:20.480]   that kind of money in this world i've been reading as i mentioned several times dog fight fred vocal
[00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:25.120]   stein story of google and apple and the google apple wars and it becomes very clear when you
[00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:29.760]   read that i think it's a fair even-handed book by the way it becomes very clear when you read that
[00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:35.920]   that both the ipad and the iphone occurred in a time a period of time that was the only period
[00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:41.040]   of time they could have occurred people had tried to do both things and the technology just wasn't
[00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:47.040]   there now that does not in any way diminish apple's single-minded persistence at making a great product
[00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:54.720]   but uh it's more than you you had the times have to be right and i'm not in and um is there is it
[00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:59.680]   obvious what the next product is i don't think it's uh watch to be honest there'll be there'll be
[00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:03.440]   there'll be things like an i watch could be like an apple tv where it increases the value of the
[00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:08.080]   overall apals ecosystem and makes the iphone or the ipad more valuable but there's no single
[00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:14.480]   a watch a car none of those things are like an iphone the ipad isn't like an iphone right yeah
[00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:18.640]   we also have to acknowledge that one of the reasons why apple could be so successful with the iphone
[00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:23.280]   is that they were probably the only major tech company that had no investment and no development
[00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:28.400]   of of phones at that point so they were the only company that was truly free to create something
[00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:33.040]   brand new and start off with a blank slate they were able to start off with what is the best phone
[00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:38.880]   we can design in 2007 blackberry we it's there were a lot of reasons why they failed but one of them
[00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:44.080]   is that they were so successful at building phones that were designed to be great for 2001-2002
[00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:48.400]   and once you say hi we're blackberry we're going to create something that's completely
[00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:53.040]   incompatible with everything else you've used before using a completely new interface that you
[00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:57.920]   have never seen before and so nothing you love about our existing products will be applicable
[00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:03.680]   to this new one wow that would have flopped so big and so hard always that at an excellent point
[00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:08.720]   and so so not not only that but also apple another advantage that apple has is that
[00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:14.720]   they'll get lots of people on board quickly they're because they have said they've earned so much
[00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:19.920]   currency with their users that if you drop a brand new device in my in my lap that i don't
[00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:24.880]   maybe completely get on first first viewing the fact that it's an apple product will
[00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:28.160]   lead me to think that perhaps there's something about this that i'm not getting right now but i
[00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:32.640]   will get in the future i will stick with this that's not sort of sort of thing you get from from
[00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:37.680]   a microsoft product or no key a product or anything like that so it's there's so many big factors to
[00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:42.240]   that and uh the innovation and the really great design of the first iphone is just part of it yeah
[00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:47.600]   this is time i do not envy apple at this point this is a very tough world there
[00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:53.520]   and a lot of the people they're more like blackberry now than they were in 2007 right they
[00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:58.480]   they have these big heads so they because they they've always been a company that says
[00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:06.320]   is or excuse me after 19 after their recovery from the 1997 era they are they are a company that they
[00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:10.160]   they know what they want to do they know where they're headed and now they and they have enough
[00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:15.360]   of a safety cushion monetarily that they can essentially keep driving towards that target
[00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:20.720]   even if people aren't going to be jumping on board with them immediately uh they are they they are
[00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:28.080]   they are willing to even dead tell their investors that if you don't like what we're doing with this
[00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:32.480]   company if you think that we're not pursuing opportunities your sell your stock we will buy
[00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:36.480]   it from you as you can see we are buying lots of our stop back because that's how much we like
[00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:41.600]   apple stock right now so black blackberries problem was that they really never they really
[00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:46.240]   never had that ability to say here is where we absolutely want to go in five years their only
[00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:50.640]   plan was we want to continue to sell phones and make lots and lots of money at that that's not how
[00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:55.680]   apple succeeded apple succeeded by saying that it is okay for us to do a brand new style of computer
[00:43:55.680 --> 00:44:01.120]   that is not does not run Mac OS because it can't this this new tablet computer will fail if it runs
[00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:05.200]   a desktop operating system we're going to create a brand new product category that's not something
[00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:09.280]   that a company that is fixated on just making the next successful product is going to be able to
[00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:14.560]   pull off it's a bit unfair to say Tim you know Tim Cook is blamed for maps a project that started
[00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:20.080]   under Steve Jobs he's also one of the reasons why the products that Steve Jobs was therefore were
[00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:24.640]   manufactured so efficiently and were available at the price that they're available for it's very
[00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:29.200]   it's very difficult to unwind who did what in those relationships uh so you know saying you know
[00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:34.000]   Tim Cook hasn't done anything or nothing's happened since Steve Jobs or problems have happened post Steve
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:37.840]   Jobs when lots of problems happen with Steve Jobs I think all of that is a little bit disingenuous
[00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:49.440]   all right apple is going to put shazam into iOS 8 so that's good yep that's that's that's a big
[00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:56.160]   deal with I was just using uh google now's music search feature just the other week and uh before
[00:44:56.160 --> 00:45:00.800]   the show start I was talking about stuff that there there are very few things that really makes me
[00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:07.040]   feel like my god I am living in the future this is something where if if a 1982 technology company
[00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:11.680]   wanted to do like a speculative this is what the future is going to be like in the year 2000
[00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:15.920]   and you'll be able to simply and the ability to be sitting in a restaurant hearing a piece of music
[00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:19.920]   about to ask the waiter what is that song and then realizing wait a minute I can just simply go
[00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:24.560]   google now tap the microphone hold it up and there not only is that the song but here is the button
[00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:29.680]   on where to buy it uh it's such a candy feature such an important feature that yeah that's that's
[00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:33.600]   once it's important for them to have it but it's surprising they haven't put it in yet
[00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:41.520]   I'm glad they're doing that now this is rumor right Renee but what are people seeing this code in
[00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:46.080]   their beta versions is that why no there's no beta version yet this is iOS 8 stuff this is
[00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:49.840]   stuff that apples rumored to I think a lot of times the stuff you rumored now have been rumored
[00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:54.080]   for a couple of years right people have wondered why apple hasn't bought a shazam like company because
[00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:58.320]   it is such a basic it is such a basic feature that competing devices have but you know apple
[00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:02.080]   typically goes through their list and is that famous Greg Jaws we act line of yeah yeah we know
[00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:05.760]   cut and paste is really really important and it's on the list I just can't tell you how high up how
[00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:09.760]   high up it is on the list yeah this is sort of the same thing do we know if google does its own
[00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:17.040]   a recognition in google now or if they license another companies I don't know i'm gonna guess they
[00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:23.680]   do their own but i don't it doesn't seem like a really complicated thing well you know it reminds
[00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:28.720]   me of that tv show silicon valley have i mentioned that on a well with the awesome taste in web tabs
[00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:37.120]   with that yes the company pie piper this guy's starting the the idea he came up with is that any
[00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:41.920]   recording artist can go to piper and play the song he's about to compose into it see if anybody
[00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:47.840]   else has used that riff before and they're all blown away because this guy can search this
[00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:52.000]   huge database of songs in such a quick period of time turns out he can he has this amazing
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:58.560]   compression algorithm right and that's what turns out to be so valuable but yeah that that
[00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:03.360]   i don't know how easy that is because you've got a lot of songs in the world there's 20 million
[00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:08.880]   songs in the in the iTunes category catalog right that music dna project that fingerprints
[00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:13.200]   at all the songs and they all use that to do they do they do they do a hash i guess they must do a
[00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:20.400]   hash but even if it's what you have to compare the hash you just made with 20 million hashes that's not
[00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:28.080]   that that seems like a lot of work compute intensive yes if it's if it weren't more clever than we're
[00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:31.840]   making it out to be then that's what an entire data center would be doing doing nothing but pattern
[00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:38.880]   matching uh it's it's interesting it's and it's and it's above my uh my college math skills there's
[00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:44.480]   there's a matrix matrix calculus is like yeah maybe not maybe i'll just ask somebody with what
[00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:51.200]   the answer is to that one um but yeah it's it's gonna be great to say Siri what song is this uh
[00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:59.040]   incidentally uh just came in over the wire over the trans of a 23 megabyte update to ios 7 7.1.1
[00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:05.760]   is out further improvements to touch id fingerprint recognition fixes a bug that could impact
[00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:10.800]   keyboard responsiveness fixes an issue using bluetooth keyboards with voiceover enabled
[00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:16.640]   boy that seems like i mean they just released an update and the security i looked at security
[00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:20.160]   updates not available yet but there's probably released in os 10 security i think there's a little
[00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:24.880]   heart bleed in there somewhere don't you think a little something something something something
[00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:32.400]   on the heart bleed side of things i don't know anyway uh while apple doesn't say how urgent it is
[00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:36.880]   or anything it is an update you probably want to get an apple the nice thing about apple the users
[00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:42.320]   they pretty much do these right away at 23 megabytes is not gonna break the budget as they say
[00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:53.280]   speaking of court cases a court rules that rockstar has to fight google not in texas where all
[00:48:53.280 --> 00:49:00.720]   great patent lawsuits are filed because east texas is is very favorable to the plaintiff a rocket
[00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:11.040]   docket yeah but in fact in california as google wished um the rockstar is a patent role that is
[00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:19.360]   paid for by intellectual ventures but also apple microsoft sony erics and and blackberry
[00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:23.840]   they bought the nortail pads four and a half billion dollars worth of nortail patents
[00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:29.680]   and formed this company rockstar that spends a lot of time reverse engineering stuff to see if
[00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:34.640]   they can sue them rockstar suit google and seven companies that make androids smart fall out of
[00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:40.480]   the phones uh on halloween google immediately countersuit saying hey can we do this in california
[00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:48.160]   u.s. district judge claudia wilkin agreed with google using this is quoting ours technica using
[00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:52.640]   sharp language that suggests rockstar won't have an easy time litigating this case the first thing
[00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:58.080]   she did was dispense with the idea that rockstar's co-plaintive texas based mobile star should be
[00:49:58.080 --> 00:50:02.880]   treated as something separate and distinct from rockstar quote the circumstances here strongly
[00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:08.800]   suggest that rockstar formed a mobile star as a sham entity for the sole purpose of avoiding
[00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:15.120]   jurisdiction in all other fora except more mobile stars state of incorporation delaware and claimed
[00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:23.360]   principal place of business texas a mere day oh this is a little sharp-tongued a mere day before
[00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:30.240]   it initiated litigation against google's customers rockstar freshly minted mobile star with no california
[00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:35.200]   contacts and assigned the asserted patents to that subsidiary this happens all the time by the way
[00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:39.840]   this is the shenanigans it goes on the effect if you've ever listened to the this american life about
[00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:46.080]   the podcast i mean sorry the uh in patent troll i don't know why the word podcast snuck in there
[00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:51.120]   the patent trolls in east texas they've got all these dummy offices down there
[00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:58.000]   so that they can sue in east texas so the venue moved to california that's a that's a victory for
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:07.120]   google and i think that uh based on this judges uh ruling you got to figure that when you're the
[00:51:07.120 --> 00:51:12.720]   lawyer and the judges referring to your actions as a sham corporation not going to go well that she
[00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:18.720]   by the way she also pointed out that the majority stakeholder rockstar is apple which put 2.6 billion
[00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:26.080]   into the 4.5 billion dollar purchase of north house patents and owns she says at least 1,147
[00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:33.920]   of the 2,000 patents she said uh hey you know you're owned by a california corporation i think you
[00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:41.440]   should do it california okay okay this is not a judge asking if hbo is a broadcast channel is
[00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:46.720]   what is this is what we're getting at here she also apparently read the isax and biography of
[00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:52.960]   steve jobs another quote from the ruling google and apple's rivalry in the smartphone industry is
[00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:58.800]   well documented apple's founder stated that he viewed android as a quote rip off end quote of
[00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:04.000]   iphone features and intended to quote destroy android by launching quote a thermonuclear war
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:10.480]   straight out of isaxon defendant's litigation strategy of suing google customers is consistent
[00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:15.600]   with apple's particular business interest this quote scare the customer and run tactic
[00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:21.120]   advances apple's interest in interfering with google's android business wow finally a judge
[00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:26.320]   that kind of sees through this whole thing yeah rockstar senior management is based in ontario
[00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:34.720]   canada my fault my bad sorry that's where nortell was yes it also has a small office in plano
[00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:38.560]   texas of course in the east district of texas well it gets cold in toronto
[00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:42.640]   who wants to be there when you could be in plano
[00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:47.840]   well that's interesting uh you know the same things happening in the podcast lawsuits
[00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:52.400]   uh i think one of the big networks which is being sued by the podcast role is trying to do
[00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:57.280]   preemptively or maybe maybe there was a preemptive lawsuit trying to change the venue to uh
[00:52:57.280 --> 00:53:03.360]   uh either new york or boston where they feel they get a fairer hearing that he's texas so that's
[00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:12.560]   interesting this is not an unusual this uh don't get me started so many of the headaches apple uh
[00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:18.080]   uh of course the rumors are strong that apple will sometime perhaps sooner than later
[00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:22.160]   release two new lifons of four point seven inch and what a five inch
[00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:26.880]   you didn't hear leo the unannounced five point five inch iphone is now delayed
[00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:32.480]   how can you delay something you never announced as of this morning they've had production problems
[00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:36.160]   with the unannounced iphone and it's going to be delayed now oh well never mind
[00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:42.320]   well to continue to continue rene's uh brilliant west wing uh analogies this is like though this
[00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:46.720]   is like the one where uh where josh liven like stumbling through a press conference
[00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:53.280]   hinted at a super top secret budget solution proposal and and the president is say after a say
[00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:57.760]   not only did you announce that you had that i have a super top secret solution the economy
[00:53:57.760 --> 00:54:05.600]   but you also do not agree with this plan yeah so yes top secret plan exclusive fabrication on the
[00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:11.360]   five point seven five one inch iphone they're they're having a problem with yields on the display i
[00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:16.080]   mean it was it was much like a column that i wrote in 2012 about how i don't think that apple is
[00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:20.880]   going to have the savvy know how to go to heaven it's amazing every year apple is rumored to be
[00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:25.200]   making a new device that new mr device is then rumored to be delayed and apple releases it at
[00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:31.600]   the same time they released the rumor device from last year so will apple do a four point seven
[00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:38.080]   that seems credible yes four point seven is i've said this before it is just the right size current
[00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:44.240]   iPhones are four inches little a little smaller not a lot you can still hold four point seven in
[00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:48.880]   your hand still do the thing that apple wants to do which is navigate with your finger with holding
[00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:54.560]   it in one hand um i like four point seven and as you pointed out rene that wouldn't require a new
[00:54:54.560 --> 00:55:00.240]   scale right they could anything up till five i mean if they go to exactly five it'll be the same
[00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:05.040]   pixel per inch as the ipad air which means it can keep making the same panels
[00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:09.360]   four point seven though i do think is better i mean i have a couple of five inch phones behind
[00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:12.560]   me and they they just feel a little bit too big i think four point seven is a nice thing just
[00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:19.840]   ordered because just for completeness understand that i just ordered the six inch no kia 1520
[00:55:19.840 --> 00:55:24.800]   it's a beautiful phone it's he is a big look at my head but it's beautiful it is it is a lovely
[00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:28.960]   phone and for people who are doing lots of reading during their commutes uh hopefully on the subway
[00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:34.400]   not in their cars it is a nice happy medium between having a full-size pad and a small size one but
[00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:39.600]   i mean at some point like leo you should like get like you know how like in uh in uh in uh in
[00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:45.200]   machine shops they got like the socket wrench set that has like every single size socket lens from
[00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:48.720]   oh i could do that i can't do that with phones at this point yeah yeah i have a
[00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:52.880]   samsung graphic they had someone put a graphic up on twitter of all the samsung displays and
[00:55:52.880 --> 00:55:57.120]   there was this missing inch between i think seven and eight there's an entire inch without a samsung
[00:55:57.120 --> 00:56:02.240]   display size in between it how could that be i it's it's impossible somebody must be fired
[00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:08.640]   they missed one inch fired that's pretty funny they've got everything but one at quarter inch
[00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:13.760]   intervals everything at quarter inch at four inches all the way up to 12 inches i think that's
[00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:18.080]   pretty cool but that that's clearly a concerted effort right that doesn't happen by accident no
[00:56:18.080 --> 00:56:22.960]   that's the same sam's song's idea is that anybody who wants to buy a phone that has money in their
[00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:26.960]   hand their their goal is to take money out of that hand and put the phone they want in that
[00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:31.680]   hand which is a perfectly valid way to go out about your business and it's also you know
[00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:36.880]   it's a brute force method of marketing but it's been working very well for them so far and
[00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:42.480]   and so i mean there's years you know i i would be addressing that rumor though i'd be really shocked
[00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:48.320]   if apple uh it didn't do a larger screen iphone but i'd be just a shock if they didn't also have the
[00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:53.920]   standard size iphone five sized uh screen there too uh because it's a great form factor people
[00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:58.400]   like it accessories work great with it and it's also the people who just don't want a larger phone they
[00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:02.480]   they there's reasons why you can buy smaller screen dandroid devices that's because a lot of
[00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:06.880]   people like the smaller phones love the people who don't have these you know big greasy workmen
[00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:17.040]   mitts like i have philip elmer de witt writing in fortune uh this week analyst estimate that i
[00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:24.800]   pad sales were down the average of of 19.3 million that's the average of analyst's guesses uh
[00:57:24.800 --> 00:57:32.800]   okay so apple hasn't said and it ranges from horris deadayu of asymco who says 21.8 million
[00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:37.760]   ipad sold all the way down to a guy from the bray berm group says 15 million but if you put
[00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:44.800]   the average at 19.3 de witt says this means ipad sales are slowing down but as i mentioned when
[00:57:44.800 --> 00:57:50.240]   we talked about this on ipad today yesterday if you look at the graph yeah they're slowing down
[00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:56.800]   from the peak when the new ipad came out but last two quarters of ipad sales still beat every other
[00:57:56.800 --> 00:58:05.200]   quarter but two since the ipad was released so i i would take that slow down yeah right not a
[00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:09.280]   bad business but it's a wall speed is insanely well wall speed is based on future expectations not
[00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:13.520]   current or an i understand we don't we don't pay attention to it yeah i mean if if sports were
[00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:17.760]   ported the same way that like businesses reported will we be saying that med kavlessi actually came
[00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:22.400]   in fifth in the boston marathon based on what sports analyst predicted the finishing time would
[00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:27.920]   be and we thought he would finish that so much better time so even though he won very very really
[00:58:27.920 --> 00:58:32.160]   didn't point that he only managed to cross the finish line first you're right that's a perfect
[00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:36.080]   analogy you can do it faster next year so we're gonna down rank and right now just it we're
[00:58:36.080 --> 00:58:41.680]   gonna build in depreciation for next year we've always known this but uh wall street journal confirms
[00:58:41.680 --> 00:58:48.480]   what many have thought that apple and google uh vi to offer game manufacturers exclusivities or to
[00:58:48.480 --> 00:58:53.760]   buy exclusivity on their platforms we know plants versus zombies came out on the app store
[00:58:53.760 --> 00:59:01.760]   on apple three or four months before it came out on android apparently um basically google and
[00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:07.040]   apple both offer companies promotional boost premium placement on the home pages and featured
[00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:14.160]   lists there's there i do know from our own experience with the shows that getting featured on iTunes
[00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:19.040]   is huge and it's got and that's for podcasts it's got to be even worse for apps with her
[00:59:19.040 --> 00:59:24.240]   millions of possibilities and nobody would even know your game existed unless you got featured
[00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:29.680]   look at Beyonce Leo she blanketed the iTunes music store for brilliant two weeks one such a
[00:59:29.680 --> 00:59:34.480]   brilliant move and i would imagine that she talks to apple and apple talk that's different
[00:59:34.480 --> 00:59:40.320]   with iTunes because iTunes music is the king um but in the i would say the android app store
[00:59:40.320 --> 00:59:45.200]   versus the iTunes apple app store they're they're kind of neck and neck at this point
[00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:49.840]   not in rev in downloads and numbers yeah but not in revenue still although they're catching up
[00:59:49.840 --> 00:59:54.080]   androids of course been much behind but they are catching up but that's an acceleration curve if
[00:59:54.080 --> 00:59:58.960]   you're behind it you and you're growing your acceleration is inevitably faster right um zep
[00:59:58.960 --> 01:00:03.840]   they quote uh they referred to zepto lab sequel to cut the rope which was introduced in december
[01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:08.480]   zepto labs and apple agreed to a three-month window of exclusivity in exchange for the store
[01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:13.760]   prominently promoting the game according to a person familiar with the matter and then in android
[01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:20.720]   late march there you go interesting though uh for a long time companies were very
[01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:26.560]   loath to make an android version at all they really wanted to keep on apple's good side and
[01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:30.560]   there was always this kind of notion that apple may look you know may only feature you if you're
[01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:36.320]   in fact they even have a section uh you know ios exclusives um and you want to you know you want
[01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:41.120]   to get in that section i do note that in every one of these cases while apple had an exclusive
[01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:46.640]   for a month or two or three these companies did not forgo android they came out on android
[01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:51.600]   eventually last night i got to watch son of the batman on itunes and i tweeted about it and people
[01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:55.360]   like it's not available on google play yet but it's part of apple's you know one week early release
[01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:59.840]   program and we've seen that i mean the star trek into darkness went to target in walmart and all
[01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:04.240]   these different stores with different you know special features because everyone is so keen to
[01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:08.560]   get whatever advantage they can and the distribution is so tight like there there aren't that many
[01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:12.480]   app stores i think amazon is doing something similar with air app star but those are your only
[01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:16.480]   points of getting onto users so everyone's going to try to manipulate those it's good for the artist
[01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:20.320]   because of they can get a great deal from amazon or apple they get more promotion it's good for apple
[01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:24.960]   or amazon or google because it makes them at least for a short period of time look more attractive i
[01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:29.040]   think it's just how business has always worked that way none of the companies involved would
[01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:35.360]   comment of course um seventy according to app ani i don't know who they who she is when she's at home but
[01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:40.080]   i guess that's some company that does this the metrics come out there they're exactly they
[01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:44.560]   they they they track sales of uh mobile apps according to app ani and a 70 percent of
[01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:51.680]   the revenue on uh mobile apps is in video games 70 percent this is the category you know
[01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:56.720]   uh yeah if it really it really does feel like it's almost meaningless for any platform to boast
[01:01:56.720 --> 01:02:01.680]   about the size of their app library or how much money it's generating because it is just so
[01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:06.880]   lopsided into games and then not only that but so lopsided towards in app purchases that it's hard
[01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:12.320]   to make the case if you're trying to get developers to support your team as opposed to somebody else's
[01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:17.600]   based on the amount of revenue it's like okay if you're making a game in which people have to pay
[01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:22.560]   an extra three dollars to put more popcorn into the movie theater machine then yes definitely
[01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:25.840]   you should get this platform over another if not you're better off just trying to build
[01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:30.640]   grown audience and trying to make your hundred dollars a day however you can it's interesting too
[01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:35.600]   i mean will apple eventually need exclusives the console business for years had mario and sonic
[01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:40.480]   and halo and those really helped build up uh stickiness for the platforms google and other and
[01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:45.600]   amazon and other companies have bought a lot of previous ios apps like you know snapseed fantastic
[01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:50.720]   all the nicks of went to to google apple so far hasn't been buying they bought syrian and a few
[01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:54.640]   others chomp but they haven't been wholesale buying very popular apps and they've been losing
[01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:58.240]   them to companies that are willing to buy them so i wonder if we'll actually see first party
[01:02:58.240 --> 01:03:02.480]   exclusives at some point if this curve continues boy that really does underscore the power of that
[01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:06.480]   though because when you say mario i know immediately nintendo when you say sonic i know immediately
[01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:12.160]   sega when you say halo i know immediately microsoft xbox i mean they are so tightly tied
[01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:18.080]   to those platforms but i have to point out when the xbox one in playstation four came out last year
[01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:24.800]   uh the exclusives were very limited and i think i continue to be i don't think i really think
[01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:29.280]   the promotion is more important than x than exclusivity if you can if you can that's the one
[01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:34.960]   carat the both these stores can hang in front of you because we both know how we all know how hard
[01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:40.800]   it is to even if you have an intention of finding a specific app for ios how hard it is to find
[01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:46.480]   that one app i mean even when microsoft came out with microsoft office man i did so many keyword
[01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:50.080]   searches looking for that app because i want to get the legitimate version of it because of the
[01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:55.200]   actual official version of it and really i i had to go to microsoft.com and find their launching page
[01:03:55.200 --> 01:04:00.720]   for it in order to find it to say to say nothing of if you have a game that has gonna have any
[01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:05.440]   measure success whatsoever next in the next weekend after your number one there's going to be a
[01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:09.600]   hundred clones that have every single keyword that someone's going to search for so if you want to
[01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:13.760]   get some if you want to offer developer something of value it really is going to be we will give you
[01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:18.480]   one of those spotlight uh... spotlight uh... slots inside our carousel so that people will
[01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:25.760]   see you whether they're looking for you or not app Annie also reports this is he how come i have
[01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:32.000]   never heard her name before is this suddenly she's like everybody in these things apple come out
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:38.640]   tomorrow at your bottom download that tomorrow they'll be game app Annie says that the google play
[01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:44.560]   star saw forty five percent more downloads than the app store on ios in the first quarter
[01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:53.040]   forty five percent more downloads worldwide revenue though as you mentioned apple is comfortably
[01:04:53.040 --> 01:05:00.480]   ahead according to Annie this is this is a global hundred fifty countries um downloads are up revenue
[01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:07.280]   up but not as much in fact the the graphs is kind of interesting um you know you really
[01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:12.720]   can see the difference is that because most of these and red apps are free or people aren't
[01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:18.320]   are cheap on and i don't i mean if you've got more downloads the seems to me the revenue should
[01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:25.520]   catch up i think it partly has to do with the fact that if you have an iphone you only have a
[01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:29.840]   super premium two hundred dollar no two hundred dollars with contract phone or even if you have
[01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:34.480]   a cheap one it was once a two hundred dollars for premium contract phone android covers just as
[01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:39.520]   we talked about covers every single spot on that board and so you have a lot of people who have no
[01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:43.040]   intention of putting any more money into this phone that they paid forty nine dollars for
[01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:47.040]   and even then they're upset they didn't get it for free and that's just that's just in the u.s.
[01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:51.840]   worldwide uh where the different disparities between uh pricing of phones is so much more
[01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:56.400]   wild than it is here in the u.s. you have people who just did not buy this phone with the intention
[01:05:56.400 --> 01:06:01.040]   of spending more money on apps we're not they're not as app uh obsessed as we are in the u.s i think
[01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:06.560]   you must know my friend app Annie because that's exactly what app Annie said she said uh
[01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:12.640]   android app download volume is growing thanks to explosive growth in emerging markets in
[01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:20.560]   mexico smartphone adoption grew 75 percent last year um so that you know so that makes sense that
[01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:25.200]   you might have more downloads but you may not have more revenue downloads are also strong in
[01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:31.680]   brazil and russia now both in the top three yeah that's why a lot of these observations based on
[01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:35.920]   well here's a here's a percentage of users who are actually using the web with our devices versus
[01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:40.560]   uh competitors devices here are the number of phones that are out there here's much how much
[01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:45.760]   revenue each one is being being used for it's almost becoming meaningless as android starts
[01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:51.440]   to saturate every single device with a screen and some sort of a cpu on top of it because you just
[01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:56.720]   don't know why people are buying those things i've always uh i've always liked i've never really
[01:06:56.720 --> 01:07:01.920]   understood that metric of here's how much the how much web use is being done on ios devices versus
[01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:07.360]   android devices particularly ipad versus android tablets i would like to see that broken down by
[01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:12.400]   category to see how well that stands up i don't doubt that there is uh there's some merit to that
[01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:18.560]   comparison uh given that uh ipads are just so much more useful than almost every other uh android
[01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:24.800]   tablet i've ever used but it's it's hard it really is like a russia russia test at this point you can
[01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:28.960]   make any point you want to make about any figure you want to dig up about any segment of the mobile
[01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:33.200]   device market at this point yeah and that's to Andy's point they just it's an immature set of
[01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:37.760]   analysis and they're not segmenting the smartphone market the way they do like the auto market apple
[01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:41.440]   has zero percent of the under four hundred dollar phones right apple has zero percent of the cheap
[01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:45.520]   tablets that people buy in asia to watch videos on and if you broke down those numbers it'd be
[01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:49.680]   much more informative for everybody trying to do their job but it's either not in the best interest
[01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:52.640]   of the metric companies or they haven't developed at the point where they can offer those kind of
[01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:58.640]   statistics yet what would you suggest is categories price yeah well i mean it's the same thing as
[01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:02.960]   cars like you don't compare the cherry car sold in china to the bmw it's it's ridiculous but that's
[01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:07.760]   what happens in the phone market so yeah based on the premium market the discount market you know
[01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:11.440]   and you can start doing verticals for them as well like people who buy devices with specific
[01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:15.520]   purposes like an android powered video player probably shouldn't be counted in the same
[01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:20.160]   category as either a samsung or an apple tablet because it's not it's not the same device it just
[01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:24.320]   happens things that happen to run android you know a co-op benedict evidence that's the barely
[01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:30.000]   debug stack of drivers of this decade yeah it's just powers so many things it does including cars
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:38.880]   and so the ios app store top countries by downloads us china japan the uk and russia top countries by
[01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:45.840]   revenue pretty much the same us japan china united kingdom and australia
[01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:51.120]   so that's where the money comes from that's who downloads very different from the picture on
[01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:56.640]   android where top countries by download united states brazil russia south gria and india
[01:08:56.640 --> 01:09:01.920]   top countries by revenue japan united states south gria japan united kingdom it's almost a
[01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:06.640]   different list what's interesting is today apple also enabled uh brazil specific ratings for the
[01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:11.120]   app store for games and that was a huge point of contention i think for a long time it kept games
[01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:14.960]   out of brazil because they wouldn't support their rating system which you know skews also because
[01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:19.840]   that skews downloads it skews piracy levels because if you can't get games that greatly changes the
[01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:24.240]   equation you mean like the reviews ratings or the the mature ratings yeah the mature the yeah
[01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:30.960]   who there was a brazilian system for game ratings it's different yeah is it is it more sexy or less
[01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:38.720]   sexy i know there it caused a lot of distribution problems for i understand the bottom of the
[01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:41.040]   market is a lot fuller uh
[01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:44.640]   hey oh

[01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:40.000]   Ohio who heard about 99 designs in the show he decided it was time for a makeover of their logo
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:45.680]   the church's logo within days they had over a hundred logo options to look through took them a
[01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:49.440]   while took about a month to go through all the options choose the winning design the designer
[01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:54.800]   got paid he's point church received a fantastic new logo they loved one that respected their heritage
[01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:59.840]   but was fresh and modern i think that's just so cool and pastor Chadwick he can't say enough about
[01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:05.520]   how great the 99 designs project uh and processes thanks to mac break weekly and 99 designs
[01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:10.320]   for helping our church move into the 21st century with a great looking design it's a great way to

[01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:23.040]   really neat we talk about branding a lot you know it's a term that gets thrown around all the time
[01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:28.400]   uh what is branding it's your it's your it's the gut feeling people have about your company it's
[01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:34.560]   what you know what comes to mind when they say twit uh you know uh branding leverages
[01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:38.800]   the fundamental you know truths about your company to create emotional connections with
[01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:44.560]   your audience and design is absolutely critical in communicating that because most of the times
[01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:50.640]   it's a nonverbal thing you say so much with your design not just hey here's how we look
[01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:56.080]   here's what our logo is but you know what are we saying about our brand about our company about
[01:11:56.080 --> 01:12:01.360]   our business about who we are and it gets communicated in a nonverbal and very very powerful way by
[01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:06.000]   design that's why pastor Chadwick was so happy he wanted to kind of say we're traditional we've got
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:11.680]   a heritage but we're we're also modern this is just so cool so here's the deal go to 99 designs

[01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:50.240]   their support of Mac break weekly I need you to explain this in gadget story to me
[01:12:50.240 --> 01:13:00.560]   this is okay so Siri right you talk to Siri she sends your speech to to Apple servers probably
[01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:08.240]   North Carolina where they're interpreted and they come back to you so somehow quartet of freshmen
[01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:15.520]   at the University of Pennsylvania at a hackathon in fact invented something called
[01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:23.440]   Google spelled like the number G-O-O-G-O-L-Plex offending everybody Google and Apple in the process
[01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:29.040]   from Alex Sands, AJ Patel, Ben Shoe and Gagangupta
[01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:37.280]   this intercepts you have to change your Wi-Fi connections proxy settings it intercepts your
[01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:44.640]   Siri requests and it gives Siri more capabilities you can play tunes and Spotify turn up the heat
[01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:55.280]   on your Nest thermostat even start your Tesla I got to say I have to think there's that Apple's
[01:13:55.280 --> 01:14:01.040]   gonna shut this sucker down is this something you get on the app store and did Apple even approve
[01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:07.120]   this in the app store no you just change your settings right yeah I mean they've been jail
[01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:12.560]   break stuff that is this a jail break no but there has been jailbreak versions of Apple doesn't
[01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:17.680]   expose APIs for Siri right all of that stuff is internal and Apple does partnership deals but
[01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:21.280]   if you break into that either by jailbreak or you do I think this is probably I mean Steve Gibson
[01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:25.440]   can explain it better than me this is probably a man in the middle basically you're allowing
[01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:30.240]   a man in the middle attack yeah and then they're they're just exploiting things like Apple has to
[01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:34.560]   do this stuff slowly because if you just start exposing APIs there's all this this chance for
[01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:38.320]   collision like change my calendar well it's fantastic all gonna change it is calendar gonna
[01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:42.480]   change it right is awesome calendar gonna change it but if you're just having fun you can you can
[01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:49.200]   open up you can just open the floodgates and it turns out Googleplex has its own API so you can
[01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:57.040]   actually modify Googleplex to work with other stuff you can you can tell it what to do if it
[01:14:57.040 --> 01:15:04.640]   hears certain things this seems so illegal somehow I don't know and Gadget says hey it's an easy thing
[01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:09.200]   to change these settings I've never tried it but it's easy thing to change these proxy settings
[01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:19.840]   and you can do it the website is is better than Siri.com oh god they're asking for trouble if you have no
[01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:25.440]   repercussion worries you can do anything I guess when you're a college kid what yeah no jailbreaking
[01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:29.120]   no download it takes 30 seconds so you go to should I try this
[01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:35.680]   do you want all your Siri queries intercepted right well that's part of it is this is going to
[01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:44.320]   go through somebody right yep so um okay so I'm going to settings Wi-Fi click the i on the
[01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:53.360]   Wi-Fi setting you want you scroll down and uh http proxy is auto okay that's normal but now I
[01:15:53.360 --> 01:16:01.120]   can put in a URL there wasn't a URL there before so the URL is http I'm really gonna regret this
[01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:09.440]   aren't I colon slash slash you move your iPad down just oh you can't see it okay totally but her
[01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:16.880]   then Siri and he's gonna be turning down the lights in the studio soon dot com
[01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:27.200]   okay and that's it that's not that hard and then uh now any request I make will go
[01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:32.720]   will be rerouted through totally better than Siri but actually I got to point out
[01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:39.440]   not just your Siri requests everything you now do on the internet goes I can't recommend this no
[01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:48.240]   this but it's but it's interesting that people are showing off what the what Siri could do
[01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:54.800]   with just by people who don't even work for Apple so it's we'll get there you can tell it to play a
[01:16:54.800 --> 01:17:00.240]   song on Spotify you can tell it to turn on your lights on hue you can make it warmer you say you
[01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:07.200]   can literally say oh but you have to say Google Plex well now that's weird let me try this so now
[01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:11.760]   I press and hold google Plex turn on my lights
[01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:20.880]   yeah see it said this didn't work at all am I supposed to say Google Plex
[01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:30.240]   first time you use Google Plex you must select continue when prompted and create an account
[01:17:30.240 --> 01:17:37.360]   okay so I have to create an account first all right wow first time you I believe it's totally
[01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:43.120]   dot better than Siri dot did I do the wrong oh I left out a dot so I don't know who I'm sending
[01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:51.120]   my traffic so I can bet you there are some people who are doing that right I put a dot
[01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:55.760]   between totally and better there probably is already some Russian hacker who's who's getting
[01:17:55.760 --> 01:18:02.560]   getting my traffic not pay for more donuts now totally dot thank you's Chad you young people are
[01:18:02.560 --> 01:18:12.400]   good at this stuff totally dot better than siri dot com right is it a GPS no no let's try it
[01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:16.720]   that would be too secure google plex play demons
[01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:28.240]   this is not what's the way ah cannot verify here we go cannot verify server identity
[01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:34.880]   because it can't see google dot com because I'm now going through better than siri so I have to
[01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:43.920]   place continue and I have to sign up this is run this this Java it seems so wrong please enter
[01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:51.280]   iTunes password now we find that credit card numbers make wonderful secure plexus
[01:18:51.280 --> 01:18:57.600]   social security numbers also launch codes for nuclear vessels also with plexus oh the
[01:18:57.600 --> 01:19:04.720]   whistles whistles whistles we love whistles okay we're using name
[01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:10.480]   password should be like something really bad audience Leo does this so that you don't have to
[01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:16.400]   I yeah I'm gonna really regret this you know you probably could have launched Spotify and then
[01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:21.440]   played that song a lot sooner than this that's I hope Steve Gibson isn't watching wait a minute
[01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:27.520]   password control I did the wrong thing and it is and Chad do you have like a bucket of benzene
[01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:32.480]   that you can have really oh dump dunk his iPad into after he's done with this just to be sure
[01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:36.560]   I'm just worried you're gonna forget and then like okay let me open up the bank of america
[01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:43.200]   all right my account was made now login okay don't show this again I gotta
[01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:50.240]   your fake password given them your password Leo oh man this is such a bad idea
[01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:58.160]   I'm all set I can now use Google plex okay now what was it I supposed to do I forgot
[01:19:58.160 --> 01:20:05.680]   shall I say play music or something uh see I don't have Spotify on here that's the part of the
[01:20:05.680 --> 01:20:12.960]   problem um Google plex turn on my lights
[01:20:17.200 --> 01:20:25.440]   wait a minute oh did you see that okay so that's weird so it pulled up a web it did a web search
[01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:31.440]   and then Google plex noted that the web search was for Google plex turn on my lights I see and so
[01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:37.120]   it intercepted so intercepted the Google search noted the search term which will do every time you
[01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:44.000]   search on the internet looked for the words Google plex and said ah this one's for me and then
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:48.560]   tried to parse it and of course since I don't have you on here I have to add that to my account or
[01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:56.160]   something like that okay this is a very bad idea yeah change your settings now please oh
[01:20:56.160 --> 01:21:01.600]   I'm glad you reminded me you know delete that totally better than serie.com should be all I have
[01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:06.880]   to do right I'm still gonna it doesn't change the proxy settings to lotto I could just turn it off I
[01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:11.680]   don't use a proxy I would I would just nuke it yeah turn it off okay just just reinstall iOS
[01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:17.280]   drop it into the bucket set the bucket on fire if I want to take it outside first but
[01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:23.200]   nuke it for more but it's the only way to be sure I think is an exercise I'm sure these guys
[01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:27.600]   are completely benign I'm sure as an exercise this is very interesting and and good and I hope
[01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:33.120]   they get an A in the project actually they came in second you open up a hole it's hard to tell if
[01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:36.880]   anyone else is going in that hole that's that's my only problem so I'm sorry they didn't even take
[01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:42.800]   second they took third prize I sure like to see first a second place if that was third prize because
[01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:49.840]   that's a pretty nice hack that's a sweet hack by the way Jeff Needles was watching as well and
[01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:53.280]   yeah he's the one who told us he's one thank you Jeff
[01:21:53.280 --> 01:22:02.640]   Project Tango is a Google smartphone technology that uses apples prime sense technology
[01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:08.320]   it's an experimental smartphone from google that incorporates 3d sensors that allow users to map
[01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:16.320]   indoor and outdoor environments but if you look carefully at the chip here it's a prime sense
[01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:22.400]   Capri PS 1200 3d imaging system on a chip that apple owns because it acquired the company that
[01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:28.480]   made it last year do you imagine if there was a Samsung chip in an apple device oh wow oh wait
[01:22:28.480 --> 01:22:38.720]   wait wait there is so prime sense did connect so this is kind of the vision capabilities of connect
[01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:44.720]   but I presume apples you know licensing it right to other people oh they have existing contracts
[01:22:44.720 --> 01:22:48.560]   still making it yeah all right oh the company oh cool
[01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:55.040]   and Microsoft doesn't use prime sense anymore and it's connected in your face because they don't
[01:22:55.040 --> 01:23:02.720]   because apple owns it do you believe the stories that we hear that uh yahoo
[01:23:02.720 --> 01:23:09.120]   no yahoo's never said this there's no evidence of this it's pure speculation in the part of
[01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:15.840]   kara swisher and recode that yahoo may be planning to dump google and default to yahoo mobile search
[01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:21.280]   you would need a yahoo mobile search for us wouldn't they yeah this seems like
[01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:27.120]   I mean I'm sure you would love to be the default search apparently according to her sources
[01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:33.040]   there are two internal projects at yahoo aimed at building a viable mobile search engine and a
[01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:38.640]   monetization program uh and of course they want to convert convince apple to use it
[01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:45.360]   funded apples got to fund it no I'm just saying you know that oh yeah that's how that
[01:23:45.360 --> 01:23:51.440]   yeah if you don't have any customers you don't have any funding um first of all you've got google
[01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:57.520]   which is everybody everybody wants it have something that yahoo makes up yahoo doesn't even do their own
[01:23:57.520 --> 01:24:05.360]   search bing does doesn't seem credible yeah well if if they're wording it in terms of she wants to
[01:24:05.360 --> 01:24:12.240]   try to get apple to use yahoo services yeah oh hell yeah but yeah that's that's a credible idea
[01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:16.320]   that there's movement in place unless unless it involves apple making a massive investment in
[01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:22.080]   yahoo search technology i mean they they really are like they're they're like the indian space
[01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:27.200]   program at this point they have potential to do stuff if they were to create an industry to
[01:24:27.200 --> 01:24:30.080]   be at the level of what other people are doing right now but they don't have it right now
[01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:35.680]   tanny solomon poo pooze the whole thing he says first of all yahoo has no search technology
[01:24:35.680 --> 01:24:38.880]   that's kind of a problem and i guess you know you could get somebody to
[01:24:38.880 --> 01:24:44.960]   write something get some college kid people pays apple i think in 2012 it was a billion dollars
[01:24:44.960 --> 01:24:48.000]   that's the other problem there's a lot of money changing hands
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:52.160]   um so wouldn't be apple given yahoo money be vice-versa
[01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:59.280]   um apple and all sleep and these the and these are all rational companies apple for for all the
[01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:03.280]   famous you know growing thermonuclear against google stuff they're not going to cut off access
[01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:07.200]   to a service that is both financially very good to them and also very good to their users
[01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:12.960]   that's where Eric said he said the media treats this like high school like i i hate you and google
[01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:17.360]   hates apple and then there's nothing he says it's not we're grownups this is business
[01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:23.200]   and even if we're suing a company we still do business with them yeah even if samson and apple
[01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:28.240]   are bitterly fighting over patents apple still uses samson chips because we're grownups this is
[01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:32.960]   in high school if we say dumb things in front of cameras we're still grown maybe then
[01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:38.960]   apple building new data centers to shrink their carbon footprint as is everybody
[01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:43.840]   although i have to say apple seems to really be gaining some traction on this campaign to
[01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:48.560]   to promote the fact that it's environmentally sensitive green piece has given it high marks
[01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:52.960]   right in fact didn't even give green piece even use apple as an example did you see the Tim Cook
[01:25:52.960 --> 01:25:56.960]   narrated video they put up yesterday Leo yeah apple dot com slash environment it's interesting
[01:25:56.960 --> 01:26:00.800]   using Tim Cook too because it really plays into that Tim Cook as moral as you know moral
[01:26:00.800 --> 01:26:06.480]   or ethical center of apple i think he is don't you think i think that's his i think that's his
[01:26:06.480 --> 01:26:11.280]   differentiation from steve jobs is steve never wanted to give any money to charity for instance
[01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:15.760]   and cook immediately that's one of the things he changed right away steve was think different
[01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:22.160]   and tim really seems to be we believe and a powerful ideal she said better right before i
[01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:26.720]   end you know just look at the world and want more than anything to change it for the better
[01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:37.440]   to innovate improve to reinvent to make it better i love that Auburn accent that's soft
[01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:46.000]   Auburn accent and better can't be better if it doesn't consider everything our products our values
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:53.760]   and an even stronger commitment to the environment for the future to use greener materials less
[01:26:53.760 --> 01:27:01.440]   packaging to do everything we can to keep our products out of landfills changes that will really
[01:27:01.440 --> 01:27:09.520]   get people as well as well as well i think to us better is a force of nature the most
[01:27:09.520 --> 01:27:14.720]   unrecyclable products to build in the industry never imagined well they're all recyclable data
[01:27:14.720 --> 01:27:19.680]   centers yeah i mean they're they're recyclable and certainly in the sense you can take it back
[01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:23.920]   to an apple store and they'll if it's a working thing they'll give you a gift card for for something
[01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:28.080]   and if it's a not working thing they'll dispose of it properly and they'll you know that they're
[01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:31.280]   but only apple knows how to do that because it's all loose like a couple not on an
[01:27:31.280 --> 01:27:37.280]   right and and also they i really i really like this ad campaign i put or this ad i
[01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:42.880]   particularly like the the access they gave to steve levi about the their how they're
[01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:46.000]   trying to make as many of their data centers and even the stores as possible
[01:27:47.200 --> 01:27:53.120]   work it completely on renewable energy because it really just remind me of uh the fact that
[01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:57.760]   apple is a unique company i can't think of another company that if they started if they produced a
[01:27:57.760 --> 01:28:03.520]   spot like this i think that 40 percent of of your brain would be skeptical skeptical about okay
[01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:07.680]   well they're trying to they're trying to reposition themselves as this they're trying to attract
[01:28:07.680 --> 01:28:11.920]   that and they're trying to get people's attention off of the fact that they killed that that whale
[01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:16.960]   and run on a corporate retreat three months ago i mean other companies like sam song would if
[01:28:16.960 --> 01:28:22.080]   they wanted to pivot towards environmentalism they'd make a phone out of hemp and then stop
[01:28:22.080 --> 01:28:26.880]   making it a year apple is that you when you when you see stuff like this you really do know that apple
[01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:31.040]   does believe in this sort of stuff and it's an expression of the fact that they are running one
[01:28:31.040 --> 01:28:37.040]   company with one focus and one one heart one mind and one set of hands as opposed to you got this
[01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:41.840]   one kind of wacko guy who's kind of interested in this and they let him run wild as a distraction
[01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:47.040]   uh it's it's it's it really is a very positive thing and i'm very it's a ad that i really really like
[01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:53.840]   absolutely the other cool thing about the that they gave they gave c would be the their new vice
[01:28:53.840 --> 01:28:59.200]   president charge of greenery for lack of a better word took took leave you on a tour of their data
[01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:03.920]   centers and their their lot of their power sources but for me the most interesting part of that was
[01:29:03.920 --> 01:29:10.080]   uh when she came on board as the new vp uh asked just basically asking around about well what are we
[01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:15.840]   doing that could be improved a couple of employees said you know how we keep saying that we're doing
[01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:19.920]   a good job but we make so many things out of aluminum that but we're doing we're only getting
[01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:24.320]   them from very very good sources and we're not damaging the planet yeah i don't like the way
[01:29:24.320 --> 01:29:28.240]   we're calculating those numbers i think we're doing not as good a job as we're telling people
[01:29:28.240 --> 01:29:32.400]   and she did not it and turned out that yep there is there was no deceit but they were using a method
[01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:36.720]   of calculating a certain number that was not good and so that's one of the reasons why they fell off
[01:29:36.720 --> 01:29:40.960]   of one of their promises last year not because that they didn't do the job that they were promising
[01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:45.280]   to do to the environment but because they had to adjust their the the numbers that they were shooting
[01:29:45.280 --> 01:29:51.040]   for with this new realistic budgeting system so there's there's it's it's a great thing because
[01:29:51.040 --> 01:29:57.040]   one of the things that makes apple unique is that to an extent you buy into not just this actual
[01:29:57.040 --> 01:30:01.280]   product that you're buying or this actual service that you're using you're buying into a company that
[01:30:01.280 --> 01:30:06.080]   you believe has a set of values that intersects with values that you have or at least that values
[01:30:06.080 --> 01:30:11.120]   you approve of so i'm glad that they're getting they're they're talking a little bit more about how
[01:30:11.120 --> 01:30:16.800]   they're it's not just about again engineers in the middle of a on front of a white background
[01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:21.440]   talking about false tolerances and about how every part has to interact particularly with every other
[01:30:21.440 --> 01:30:25.600]   part but they're saying no here's things we're actually doing beyond trying to make you buy a new
[01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:29.760]   phone that we could easily get away with but we're not going to try to get away with it because we
[01:30:29.760 --> 01:30:38.320]   actually do think this stuff is important uh but it's a lossy i just remember i just was talking
[01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:45.040]   about how much i liked what are you laughing at no i'm sorry i'm just i'm just complete the headline
[01:30:45.040 --> 01:30:50.480]   because i'm just so i'm fine and i'm really happy with it this little big disc it's tiny it's cute it's
[01:30:50.480 --> 01:30:59.040]   a very fast thunderbolt to ssd external drive uh lacy is uh being acquired by seagate and oh by the
[01:30:59.040 --> 01:31:04.800]   way they have been their credit cards they've been breached for a year i'm i'm just laughing
[01:31:04.800 --> 01:31:10.080]   because i'm i'm really about only two more of these announcements away from saying i am not and i'm
[01:31:10.080 --> 01:31:14.560]   no longer going to use anything to get anything except for just bartering i'm going to have i'm
[01:31:14.560 --> 01:31:19.760]   going to have goats and sheep and if you want me to buy one of your phones your cars tell me how
[01:31:19.760 --> 01:31:24.800]   many sheep or goats you want will make that exchange because it's just not possible to do any
[01:31:24.800 --> 01:31:29.520]   stuff any sort of modern electronic institution uh for money changing that's not going to be
[01:31:29.520 --> 01:31:34.160]   completely hacked out the french hardware company confirmed last week that malware
[01:31:34.160 --> 01:31:40.480]   successfully made its way through to access sensitive customer information from transactions
[01:31:40.480 --> 01:31:47.680]   on its website virtually according lacy virtually everyone who's shopped on lacy's website in the last
[01:31:47.680 --> 01:31:55.600]   year is at risk it's a cold fusion flaw adobe's cold fusion software cold fusion by the way used
[01:31:55.600 --> 01:32:03.600]   by a lot of sites uh for their uh for their e-commerce and this is probably one of the great
[01:32:03.600 --> 01:32:08.400]   many sites some of which you don't even know customer names addresses email addresses
[01:32:08.400 --> 01:32:16.240]   credit card numbers card expiration dates use your names and passwords they got it all
[01:32:16.240 --> 01:32:21.760]   storing from the time well and none of it is hashed apparently or in any way obfuscated
[01:32:21.760 --> 01:32:28.000]   which is very bad practice even if even if you have a bug a bug it shouldn't be yeah
[01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:34.000]   that's why i hope that google and apple do expand their the reach of uh the right the
[01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:38.240]   iTunes wallet and the google wallet because at this point i think that's those the only two
[01:32:38.240 --> 01:32:43.920]   transactors that have i've never ever been burnt burned on even once and if there were if there
[01:32:43.920 --> 01:32:48.560]   were one store where i could buy something using my iTunes account or google wallet another store
[01:32:48.560 --> 01:32:53.520]   offering the same thing that that i couldn't use that for i would almost certainly uh opt for the
[01:32:53.520 --> 01:32:56.960]   one that uses iTunes or google wallet even if it costs a little bit more and i had to wait two
[01:32:56.960 --> 01:33:05.360]   days to get it steve gipson is coming up on security now he has tweeted that the ios update is nothing
[01:33:05.360 --> 01:33:11.040]   major just fixes bugs i guess he's looked into the security uh i don't you know i don't know steve
[01:33:11.040 --> 01:33:14.560]   if you can be sure of that because apple does not often does not reveal
[01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:19.600]   the security have a link but you click on it and almost always take two days before there's an
[01:33:19.600 --> 01:33:24.240]   update on it yeah he does say however that and i didn't know this i'm gonna do it right now there
[01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:31.680]   is an a os 10 update uh that just came out that he says you should absolutely install
[01:33:32.720 --> 01:33:39.840]   a sap i don't i don't see it here oh here it is security update 2014 002 1.0
[01:33:39.840 --> 01:33:48.160]   safari includes safari 703 it may be these are new safari certificates one of the ways
[01:33:48.160 --> 01:33:52.880]   certificate revocation or heart bleedies be the only way really it's being effectively handled is
[01:33:52.880 --> 01:34:01.680]   by updating certificates um certificate authorities and so forth so um that may be one of the things
[01:34:01.680 --> 01:34:06.560]   this is requires a download and a restart it's about 80 megabytes so i'm doing it right now
[01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:11.360]   and uh i'll ask steve about google plex
[01:34:11.360 --> 01:34:20.320]   this is really that's where i'm getting my update as a matter of fact um
[01:34:20.320 --> 01:34:28.240]   what is this how to leak the iphone six a beginner's guide from phonecruncher.com
[01:34:31.280 --> 01:34:39.040]   wow this is a tutorial on if you are going to leak the iphone yeah the picture must be blurry
[01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:47.120]   we've seen enough leaked images of smartphones and indeed uh the iphone five and iphone six to
[01:34:47.120 --> 01:34:53.360]   know that a proper leaked image has to be blurry have you ever seen it perfectly in focus hd gallery
[01:34:53.360 --> 01:34:59.920]   of leaked pictures no um if you're going to leak your own picture start with the basic stance
[01:35:00.720 --> 01:35:05.600]   obviously you'll most likely be standing still when taking pictures so we suggest swaying to the
[01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:10.560]   side slightly just as you take the snap to add some motion blur ideally you want to ensure the
[01:35:10.560 --> 01:35:15.680]   actual product you're photographing is barely recognizable only partly in view you could
[01:35:15.680 --> 01:35:21.120]   go to do a pretty good job with the iphone four include blueprints if there's one key element to
[01:35:21.120 --> 01:35:25.760]   any legit looking leads pictures it's blueprints no whether the plans are actually of the product
[01:35:25.760 --> 01:35:32.960]   you're photographing is irrelevant nobody really knows what blueprints say a factory setting is ideal
[01:35:32.960 --> 01:35:38.080]   recent leaked images of the iphone six have clearly been taken in a production line
[01:35:38.080 --> 01:35:44.000]   warehouse yeah so if you're playing a leaking your own four six images we suggest you do the same
[01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:52.160]   post-emones signo weibo yeah if your leaked image offers a very slight glimpse of some
[01:35:52.160 --> 01:35:57.760]   workers and overalls that certainly adds to the impact and obnoxious watermark must be visible
[01:35:57.760 --> 01:36:03.840]   here's one from nowhere else dot fr yeah there are some sites that take the sign
[01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:07.360]   away about watermarks one and then whatever tiny site republish it and watermarker that add
[01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:11.840]   a third layer of watermarks on top of it just so you can't see anything in the
[01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:16.160]   putting a watermark over your images that cherry on the cake when it comes to leaked gadget pictures
[01:36:16.960 --> 01:36:22.880]   the ultimate iphone six leaked image we've produced this what we believe is the ultimate
[01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:28.480]   iphone six image after weeks of research we've included photo blur blueprints a factory setting
[01:36:28.480 --> 01:36:35.680]   and of course a nice big watermark the actual iphone six is included but it's tough to identify
[01:36:35.680 --> 01:36:38.480]   thanks to the slight tilt and the blurring
[01:36:43.600 --> 01:36:46.000]   it's it's funny because it's true
[01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:52.160]   i'm not going to do the washington post story about sam san
[01:36:52.160 --> 01:36:56.400]   saying oh steve jobs just died it's an opportunity
[01:36:56.400 --> 01:37:03.920]   okay i just did it uh it's a business it's a business yeah it's a deep paraphrase i mean right
[01:37:03.920 --> 01:37:08.640]   i read it you need to know the context in which it is right i don't think anybody's that quite

[01:40:41.360 --> 01:40:46.480]   all right now and he and i goes pick of the week ladies and gentlemen uh please don't roll your
[01:40:46.480 --> 01:40:50.160]   eyes audiences this is an android app but it's an android app that lets you use android phones with
[01:40:50.160 --> 01:40:54.960]   the mac very very very very well oh that was close uh there you go this is a really cool app called
[01:40:54.960 --> 01:41:01.200]   droid naz and it is the absolutely easiest way to share files between an android device and
[01:41:01.200 --> 01:41:06.320]   pretty much anything apple makes uh this is really the entire interface you tap this button that says
[01:41:06.320 --> 01:41:13.360]   start server and i've got my mac mirrored here so watch what happens if you look down here hopefully
[01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:21.600]   after it takes a second for the server to start announcing via bonjour on network if you look down
[01:41:21.600 --> 01:41:28.080]   here and once there you go my phone the nexus five shows up right here as a standard samba server
[01:41:28.080 --> 01:41:35.760]   and if i click on this here is the entire file storage of this thing uh of this device which i
[01:41:35.760 --> 01:41:41.120]   can then that just simply browse so if i want to pull photos off of it movies off of it documents
[01:41:41.120 --> 01:41:47.520]   downloads if i want to take files off of it put files onto it it's just all through this regular
[01:41:47.520 --> 01:41:53.920]   finder interface it sets it really just sets sets itself up as a completely standard
[01:41:53.920 --> 01:42:01.440]   samba server and so it really will work with absolutely everything uh the other cool thing about
[01:42:01.440 --> 01:42:07.680]   it is that once again it is a standard smb server uh which means that here let me see if i can find
[01:42:07.680 --> 01:42:15.920]   something cool uh here's the photos there you go uh here's the photos uh thingy uh folder that's
[01:42:15.920 --> 01:42:21.120]   the technical name and this is all happening over wi-fi so it's not this not the fastest thing in the
[01:42:21.120 --> 01:42:28.640]   world uh but uh i should not try to demonstrate while i go at the same time uh but uh here we go
[01:42:28.640 --> 01:42:35.760]   let's take a look at the cool screenshot that i made maybe uh there you go and actually i've just
[01:42:35.760 --> 01:42:40.800]   realized the lack of wisdom of randomly showing you pictures off my phone so i'm gonna do that but
[01:42:40.800 --> 01:42:48.480]   uh but trust me trust me that uh hey let me let me try let me try something else let me try something
[01:42:48.480 --> 01:42:52.720]   else i guess the idea you got you got the idea you can go in both directions right i can copy files
[01:42:52.720 --> 01:42:56.800]   to the phone and exactly you're navigating all the way now are you using kickback because supposedly
[01:42:56.800 --> 01:43:02.800]   the kickcat update made it weird about copying files to this sd card nope it works okay if i
[01:43:02.800 --> 01:43:07.680]   don't have an sd card you're on an axis file never right that right exactly here you go actually
[01:43:07.680 --> 01:43:13.200]   hear about this uh yeah so here you have an sd card this may give you fits now the other the
[01:43:13.200 --> 01:43:17.040]   other really cool thing is that again it's a standard smb server so we'll also work on your
[01:43:17.040 --> 01:43:21.760]   ipad and on your iphone if you've got a third party app that will mount network file shares so
[01:43:21.760 --> 01:43:26.400]   it's just like it's the times when you like you take a picture like on your non-apple phone and you
[01:43:26.400 --> 01:43:31.360]   want to edit it in iPhoto it used to be that okay so i guess that just for the just to move this one
[01:43:31.360 --> 01:43:37.360]   picture i'm going to have to upload it into dropbox and then go into my ipad which is only a wi-fi
[01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:42.960]   ipad and i can then find a way to download it from dropbox if i have this all i have to do now is just
[01:43:42.960 --> 01:43:49.120]   simply start the server open up my server my client app on uh on my ipad and then simply
[01:43:49.120 --> 01:43:55.200]   and simply move it to move it that way it's just that easy now the only bummer associated with it
[01:43:55.200 --> 01:44:01.520]   is has nothing to do with the app has nothing to do with android uh mavericks really broke smb in a
[01:44:01.520 --> 01:44:07.600]   really really hostile way uh so that it's possible that if you're running mavericks you will launch
[01:44:07.600 --> 01:44:12.960]   this app uh start the server and then uh your mac will be able to find it but won't be able to
[01:44:12.960 --> 01:44:17.040]   connect to it and then you'll have to like do a work around or two of which have been published
[01:44:17.040 --> 01:44:22.160]   uh uh in scads and scads and scads since mavericks came out to get that to work but otherwise it
[01:44:22.160 --> 01:44:27.360]   works just fine uh and the last the last thing i'll i'll show you about it that's really cool is that
[01:44:27.360 --> 01:44:32.320]   it understands that i'll stop the server so i can get back here it understands that there are different
[01:44:32.320 --> 01:44:37.440]   you know you might not want the entire contents of your phone to be visible so right now i've got
[01:44:37.440 --> 01:44:42.480]   it on the home setting which is okay i trust everybody on this network it's just you know me and my stuff
[01:44:42.480 --> 01:44:47.520]   dog so i'll let the entire thing if you tap on office suddenly you don't get access to the
[01:44:47.520 --> 01:44:53.120]   camera roll or the or the entire contents of the device if you're in a public internet cafe all you
[01:44:53.120 --> 01:44:58.160]   can get are things you've downloaded in music and you can adjust these for each situation
[01:44:58.160 --> 01:45:02.080]   uh so it's not as though you will start this and suddenly you've got this immense security
[01:45:02.080 --> 01:45:07.920]   hole on your device and of course as soon as you tap stop uh it stops being a uh a samba server and
[01:45:07.920 --> 01:45:13.040]   now it's just regular uh regular phone so it's a free app uh it's a really wonderful wonderful
[01:45:13.040 --> 01:45:17.360]   thing and it's it's one of those things where it's simple it works you can use it in a myriad of
[01:45:17.360 --> 01:45:21.280]   different ways and if you have this just on your device there will be a time where it will save
[01:45:21.280 --> 01:45:25.760]   your bacon because you'll be thinking oh man if only my if only i could do an easy blue tooth
[01:45:25.760 --> 01:45:30.560]   transfer but i can't oh wait i have i can start i can establish my phone as a samba server and that's
[01:45:30.560 --> 01:45:38.960]   how i can get all my data on their tooth suite cool droid and nasa from code sector and uh
[01:45:38.960 --> 01:45:44.320]   how much is it cost free free is a good price free is a very good price thank you Andrew
[01:45:44.320 --> 01:45:49.520]   mr rene richie your pick of the week my pick of the week is an oldie but a goodie a perennial
[01:45:49.520 --> 01:45:53.840]   favorite it's one password they just announced new versions today i'm going to check the exact
[01:45:53.840 --> 01:46:00.320]   number i believe it's 4.5 for ios and 4.3 for os 10 that's correct yeah and the new version is uh
[01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:04.800]   it's been in beta for a while but it's basically their ios 7 makeover it might seem late to be
[01:46:04.800 --> 01:46:10.400]   doing an ios 7 makeover but they last updated right after ios 7 or right before or right around ios 7
[01:46:10.400 --> 01:46:14.880]   launching and it was already a really good looking app so they just tweaked it slightly uh to make
[01:46:14.880 --> 01:46:22.480]   it more ios 7e and the update for the mac greatly improves the one password mini uh they're also
[01:46:22.480 --> 01:46:26.560]   doing they did a sale when harp bleed came out they're doing a sale when these versions come out
[01:46:26.560 --> 01:46:34.080]   i was using it all weekend to change a ton and a ton of passwords because of harp bleed and it
[01:46:34.080 --> 01:46:39.360]   really does i am almost completely dependent now on one password when i install a new machine
[01:46:39.360 --> 01:46:44.160]   or a new phone or a new tablet i add drop box because that's where my one password database is
[01:46:44.160 --> 01:46:49.600]   and then i add one password and then i can log into everything and it lets me use these 20 character
[01:46:49.600 --> 01:46:55.360]   long pseudo random passwords for all these different services so hopefully when something is
[01:46:55.360 --> 01:46:59.840]   compromised it's one thing that gets compromised and it's really hard to compromise it there's a
[01:46:59.840 --> 01:47:04.640]   bunch of really good password managers last pass data vault all sorts of things i've always been
[01:47:04.640 --> 01:47:09.120]   using one password i like how it works works really well for me and these new versions i've been
[01:47:09.120 --> 01:47:13.680]   beta testing them both for a while and they've been exceptionally good and it's a great company they
[01:47:13.680 --> 01:47:18.880]   go above and beyond for their customer service so i'm always happy when a new version launches i
[01:47:18.880 --> 01:47:24.560]   wrote a column last week in which not only recommended uh one password but i also said that this is
[01:47:24.560 --> 01:47:29.760]   this is maybe we're at the tipping point now where it's no longer simply a good idea or a convenience
[01:47:29.760 --> 01:47:35.280]   to use a password manager and now you just the only these these these these harp bleed bugs and
[01:47:35.280 --> 01:47:40.000]   other problems keep coming up so often the easiest way to address these as they come up is just
[01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:44.800]   simply have a password manager generate a new absolutely bulletproof random password that you
[01:47:44.800 --> 01:47:48.880]   never have to deal with never have to mess with because it's all being done for you and the fact
[01:47:48.880 --> 01:47:55.200]   that uh one password is 50% off it's it's normally about a 70 dollar app 60 dollar app yes but not
[01:47:55.200 --> 01:48:01.520]   not bucks on the iPhone and right for the for the for the map you also buy a bundle where you'll get
[01:48:01.520 --> 01:48:05.600]   the version for your Mac for your for your mobile devices and stuff like that really good deal and
[01:48:05.600 --> 01:48:10.800]   you really should jump in right now is it is not windows or uh android or is it it's it's a totally
[01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:14.160]   cross-platform it is i think the android the new android version is really good i'm not sure if
[01:48:14.160 --> 01:48:18.080]   it's still in beta or not but i've seen it and it's fantastic and they have windows versions as
[01:48:18.080 --> 01:48:22.480]   well okay yeah the google play store version right now kind of stinks but they are working on that
[01:48:22.480 --> 01:48:27.040]   new edition that actually brings it up to stuff sure you guys like it and i used it for many years
[01:48:27.040 --> 01:48:32.480]   but i guess i'm really happy with last pass and it's a lot less expensive yep so uh and as far as
[01:48:32.480 --> 01:48:38.800]   i know does everything this one does yeah well it's i don't think it's quite a slick uh
[01:48:38.800 --> 01:48:45.120]   maybe not as much as you could use yeah and and also and also uh it's the the biggest advantage of
[01:48:45.120 --> 01:48:48.560]   last pass as far as i'm concerned is that if you have to manage a group of people in a group of
[01:48:48.560 --> 01:48:53.920]   computers it does things that uh one password just isn't inclined to do one password is for one person
[01:48:53.920 --> 01:48:58.080]   at a time uh last passes for you can do the entire family's passwords you can do your entire
[01:48:58.080 --> 01:49:03.200]   businesses passwords um my pick is something i already picked but i just want to give you an
[01:49:03.200 --> 01:49:09.920]   update i did uh get a swap on the mac pro and i it was it's been i got it on friday i sent the old one
[01:49:09.920 --> 01:49:17.040]   back and uh by the way right before the old one went back it started it stopped recognizing another
[01:49:17.040 --> 01:49:23.120]   memory slot so it was like it was clearly not in a good shape um and i'd forgotten what it was like
[01:49:23.120 --> 01:49:27.680]   to use a mac and not be terrified that it was gonna crash at any moment it's like simply you just
[01:49:28.080 --> 01:49:33.760]   you just use the computer and you feel great so it was like using mac OS 9.2 all over again i
[01:49:33.760 --> 01:49:38.640]   i happen to have a lemon i think uh but apple is very good about replacing it and the new one is
[01:49:38.640 --> 01:49:42.800]   just great and i really do like this computer especially if you're willing to spend a little money
[01:49:42.800 --> 01:49:49.280]   and get that little uh little big disc from lassi the thing is so fast just feels good using it
[01:49:49.280 --> 01:49:55.040]   best home theater pc ever will be apple ref asked me i guess he listens to this show
