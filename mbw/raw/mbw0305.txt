[00:01:49.400 --> 00:02:04.400]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show that covers the latest news from Apple iOS, Mac OS. And anything else, OS. Starting with Andy Inako on, I'm trying to think of something clever, but I could not actually come up with anything clever there.
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:12.400]   Andy Inako is here from the Chicago Sun, times the celestial waste of bandwidth. And he has behind him a Howlin Wolf. Is that a three-wheel-f-moon?
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:21.400]   No, it isn't. It's Beesa Burton, a really good graphic novel by Evan Dorkin and Jill Thompson.
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:28.400]   It's great for grownups, one of my favorite books. I happen to see it in my, I've got a folder for cool things to put on the back.
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:44.400]   There's a great, I'm going to do that a few weeks ago. Good stuff. Good stuff. Stay. We've got a couple of non regulars with this. So I want to make regulars because they're great for starting with on the way to the right. Mac OS can can Ray is here. It's good to have you on can great to have you back.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.400]   Thank you very much. Leo. I appreciate it. I also have a graphic novel behind me, by the way, actually a few of them.
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.400]   Look at that. Look at that. I can see you want to anything you want to plug. Anything particular you'd like. You also have a book about world art.
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:05.400]   I do have a book about world art. It's called World Art. Ask for it by name. And a handbell. You're not one of them guys who plays in a bell ringing crew, are you?
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:15.400]   No, I'm not. It's actually surprising though, the number of bells we have around the house. Don't ask me why. As my fiance. I don't know. I don't own one. And yet I can tell you where there are ten.
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:30.400]   You can. When she feeds you. Does she ring a bell? No. Okay, so she's not operating. No, nor have I ever tried, you know, ringing a bell for anything I want. Okay. I'm just saying.
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:43.400]   Because I like her and I want to stay in the house. Yeah, if you want to stick around, you might want to learn how to respond to the bell. Salivate appropriately. Also here, Rene Richie from iMore.com. It's great to have you, Rene.
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:58.400]   Oh, it's great to be here, Leo. Thank you. What is iMore.com? iMore.com. We're part of Mobile Nation. So, Android Central, Crackberry.com. We are the iPhone and iPad specific site within Mobile Nations. Thank God. I think we're going to say you're the Android specific site. And we got you on the wrong show.
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.400]   No, no, not this week.
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:12.400]   iPhone 5 iOS 6. In fact, we're going to talk about iOS 6. Ed Boer and iMore. Get it? I don't have graphic novels, but I do have the movie versions of the graphic novel. So I hope Andy includes me in the club anyway.
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.400]   I think that counts. Well, I'm excited about Dark Knight Rising, Batman Rising, whatever you call it.
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:29.400]   All right, so I tell you what I'm excited about. And this is a little self-centered, a little self-serving, but Apple today has released an app for podcasts.
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:39.400]   We knew that if come iOS 6 anyway, they said, or the rumors where they would separate podcasts out of iTunes and give them the ghetto of their very own. Just as they did with videos.
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:46.400]   And that was kind of weird when they did with videos. I didn't expect, and all of a sudden my videos were gone, and then I had to go to a separate app.
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:54.400]   I'm hoping that this won't get to us, but will in fact promote podcasts. You can download it now. It's free. It's on iPad and iPhone.
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:01.400]   It also has radio, which is fantastic. And I think a nice interface.
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:08.400]   But I'd sure love it if they would pre-populate it with some great podcasts like Twit.
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:14.400]   I'm just saying, let's type in Twit in the search and make sure that we show up.
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:20.400]   But I think this is good, Andy. Isn't it? You do podcasts also for a 5x5 and not Cosomonec?
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:28.400]   Yeah, you're absolutely right. There's always been sort of an awkward marriage between podcasts and the iTunes app and the music player app.
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:34.400]   The fact that you have to really spread your experience across two different apps really shows you how can pop complicated and cumbersome.
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:49.400]   And it really got to be. If you go over to an Android podcast or app or a really great app for iOS called Cast, I kind of switched most of my podcast listening over to this dedicated app because it's just so much simpler to have acquisition and listening and archiving of the exact same app.
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.400]   So yeah, this is a huge thing.
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:06:03.400]   They now have the feature podcast and the charts have been moved out. I do think that the nice thing about moving it out of iTunes is also that iTunes said subscribe and had a button that said subscribe.
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:12.400]   And there was always that concern because you're buying something when you buy music that maybe somehow subscribe is going to charge you.
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.400]   So that's a good from our point of view.
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:24.400]   And also just discovery. I mean, how many times do you have your favorite podcast, but then you sort of realize I'm kind of in a rut and also my favorite guest have an update today.
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:32.400]   I want to find something brand new. And so to build the more of a store interface than just the simple, do you know what you're looking for?
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:37.400]   We'll let you search for it by topic. It's an SQL database or something. This is clearly a big improvement.
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:43.400]   Huge. It looks like they're also doing audio and video. So that's kind of nice too.
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:52.400]   My favorite. I've only had about 10 minutes to play with it. My favorite part so far is the fact that you can actually subscribe on your phone.
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:07:00.400]   And on the iPad. So now now I can it'll automatically download. This is something that was always missing. You had to sync, which is crazy.
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:12.400]   You could well you could go. You could explicitly go from a podcast you're already subscribed to to that listing in the iTunes app and then select an episode to download it and then go back into the iTunes, the music player app.
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:17.400]   I mean, it's mentioned here is just a great step forward.
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:25.400]   This is interesting. They call this top stations and they kind of make it look like it's like a little weird radio dial.
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:31.400]   Isn't that kind of interesting? If you start playing a podcast later, then you hit the album art. You'll get a wonderfully skewomorphic old tape deck playing.
[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:35.400]   You're kidding. A little rabbit in turtle. Let me play it. It's not puffy leather, but it's close.
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:43.400]   So let's subscribe to one of my favorite shows. It's on the radio. So if I so okay, I start play it.
[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.400]   Yeah, top the top of the artwork.
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:53.400]   You can't it's a little dark. Let me look at you can cut. It's very dark, but you can see there's turning wheels.
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:08:00.400]   Be able to reel. Oh my goodness. That's just that is skewomorphic. And then look, there's a little turtle and a rabbit.
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:10.400]   That is really cute. I'm kind of glad they did that. You can't read. It's kind of dark in here for some reason, but maybe my iPads turned way down.
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:15.400]   Let's turn up. They make the whole thing a giant screen. Their designers are very careful not to give you data driven apps.
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:21.400]   They give you something old world to kind of latch on to, especially if you're a mainstream user. I think it makes a big difference.
[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:27.400]   It's just really kind of neat. There's something to look at on the iPad because you have a lot of space.
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:37.400]   It does have airplay, which is really great. I presume it has airplay for video as well. This is good news.
[00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:48.400]   This really takes this non true. I'm going to I don't like the word podcast. We'll say non traditional media or non broadcast media and puts it front and center if you're interested in this kind of thing.
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:54.400]   And I do hope that they'll make this part of the build for iOS six. So you'll get it automatically. I presume they will just as they have it.
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:09:00.400]   No, I think it's going to be like iTunes U. I think they're keeping the extra stuff off the phone and letting you download.
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:06.400]   I guess that makes sense. So we're just going to have to push everybody to download it.
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:12.400]   This is very exciting. The one thing that I wish and this is such a nitpicking thing. I mean, what's really cool.
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:20.400]   And I remember you talking about this years ago at that event in Gillian's like 2007 2008 maybe was how Apple sort of adopted podcasts and the iTunes.
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:28.400]   And then mostly seem to forget about it. I mean, there have been a couple of updates to the podcast section of iTunes, but mostly they haven't done a whole lot.
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:36.400]   It's really exciting to see them do something because once they made themselves the de facto, you know, sort of destination for podcasts for most people.
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:45.400]   They've kind of left it alone. The one I mean, if you wanted a nitpick, the one thing that I wish is that it was part of the iOS six launch when they launched the next iPhone.
[00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:53.400]   Because when we heard that they were going to do their own app for it, I thought that's going to be exciting. There's going to be this whole room of press and they're going to mention podcasts in front of them.
[00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:59.400]   And maybe, you know, the parts of the press that have forgotten that podcasts exist will suddenly remember and you know, they'll be like a day of stories.
[00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:05.400]   But you know, front and center on the app store is fantastic. And of course, I mean, name a podcast or at least a tech podcast.
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:08.400]   It's not going to be talking about it over the next week. It's really exciting.
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:12.400]   There's a reason if you're a podcast or a podcast listener.
[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:17.400]   I think they're basically using this to kind of prototype their new background downloading service.
[00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:25.400]   You've heard rumors that they're going to be downloading maps, downloading a lot of stuff, almost like PowerNap on Mountain Lion, but doing it on iOS when you're not otherwise busy.
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:30.400]   And that technology is not public facing yet. So I think this is their big test ground for that.
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.400]   And we'll hear about it more with iPhone 5.
[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:39.400]   You know, we got the message almost a year ago that we should increase the size of the album art to six to what was it.
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:42.400]   Remember something a lot bigger and we did. Thank God.
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:44.400]   16 by 16.
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:45.400]   Sixteen hundred pixels.
[00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:49.400]   Because look at this poor guy. I don't know who even know who it is. He doesn't have his name on it. It's fuzzy.
[00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:55.400]   But Orvis got the message. And if I go back to ours, our stuff really looks nice.
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:59.400]   It fills that tablet. Oh, we got to do iPad today.
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:04.400]   Ironically, for some reason, the album art has not been updated on that.
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:08.400]   But this is nice. I'm very, very happy. Thank you, Apple.
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:14.400]   You know, I said when iTunes started doing podcasts, I said, it's the best thing that happened in podcasting and the worst thing.
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:21.400]   Because, and it's true, 90% of all podcasts are downloaded via iTunes. I mean, it's just it dominates.
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:25.400]   And you live or die by iTunes. So this is huge. This really does help.
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:31.400]   What's interesting that Andy's pointed us out on past shows is that Apple continues to decouple iTunes on iOS.
[00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:34.400]   Well, it's this huge monolith on OS 10 and on Windows.
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:37.400]   They're making it increasingly dispersed and decoupled on iOS.
[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:39.400]   Why are they doing that, you think?
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:47.400]   I think that iTunes on Mac suffers for being iTunes on Windows, and it's just easier for them to bundle everything like Core Animation, Core Audio.
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:51.400]   Make that one big app and you have to support one app on Windows.
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:55.400]   We're on iOS. It's their new OS, their new playground, and they can be architected.
[00:11:55.400 --> 00:12:00.400]   I want to take a break. We're going to come back when we talk front page of the Sunday Times.
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:05.400]   I mean, lots of the times really feels like it's going after Apple somehow.
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:12.400]   I don't know why. Front page, Apple employees make less than cost co-employees.
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:17.400]   What? Anyway, we're going to talk about that.
[00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:22.400]   Are Apple employees just highly paid slaves?
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:27.400]   But first, a word from Citrix and go to meeting.
[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:33.400]   If you are doing online conference calls, online meetings, and I think most of us in business are these days,
[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:35.400]   because everybody's spread all out and everything.
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:37.400]   You've got to take a look at the new Go to Meeting.
[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:40.400]   I say new for two reasons. First of all, they've added video.
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:44.400]   You probably know that. We've talked about that a lot. HD faces, they call it.
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:47.400]   It lets you see the people you're meeting with.
[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:51.400]   You start a meeting on a PC or a Mac.
[00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:57.400]   You've got the screen sharing. They've always had that, but now you can also see and hear the meeting participants
[00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:00.400]   and hide that video. It's crystal clear. It really looks good.
[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:05.400]   As you can see in this video that we're showing you from the Go to Meeting site, it works on an iPad.
[00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:12.400]   You have to start the meeting on a desktop, but you can attend a meeting on an iPad, and it uses the camera and the iPad's mic and audio.
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:17.400]   It really makes it great to attend a meeting using your iPad.
[00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:22.400]   Now, I think if you're using Go to Meeting for sales or training or collaboration, this is a big selling point.
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:29.400]   Sales especially. You could say to your client, "Hey, you've got an iPad.
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:33.400]   The app is free. Just download it and we'll join the meeting."
[00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:37.400]   You could send them a calendar invitation. They click the calendar invitation and ICal.
[00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:42.400]   It opens Go to Meeting and they're in the meeting. It could not be easier.
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:44.400]   You could try it free for 30 days right now.
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:48.400]   If it's at go to meeting.com and use the offer code, I'm sorry, promo code, Macbreak.
[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:52.400]   It says promo code on the site, so we want to make sure you use the word promo code right there.

[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:05.400]   25 attendees per meeting.
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:10.400]   And free product training at 24/7 support. All part of that free trial.
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:14.400]   Host from a Mac or a PC. Go to meeting.com. Use the offer code, Macbreak.
[00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:17.400]   And we thank them for their support of Macbreak weekly.
[00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:26.400]   What do you think, Andy? Why did the Times put that in the front page of the Sunday Times?
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:27.400]   Is this a...
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:28.400]   He's disappeared.
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:32.400]   I think he went to get a job at the Apple Store. How about you, OSKEN?
[00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:33.400]   Mac OSKEN? Can Ray?
[00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:34.400]   Yes.
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:39.400]   Apple's retail army long on loyalty, but short on pay. Is it a scandal?
[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:42.400]   No. It's a way... I mean, well, forgive me.
[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:47.400]   I talked about it on Monday's edition of Mac OSKEN briefly. It's a way to sell papers.
[00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:48.400]   I mean, they know...
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:49.400]   Front page like...
[00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:50.400]   And what a bunch of...
[00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:51.400]   Yeah. Okay.
[00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:55.400]   Tropical Storm Debbie bearing down on the Gulf Coast. This is what I said Monday.
[00:14:55.400 --> 00:15:01.400]   Presidential race in the U.S. first ever democratic election in Egypt, forest fires in the West.
[00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:09.400]   Jerry Sandusky. Ugh. Ugly, horrible. And I know that story ended on Friday, but there's a chance to have a national dialogue about what happened to those kids.
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:17.400]   And what above the fold front page, Sunday edition of the New York Times, is it sometimes it sucks to work in retail.
[00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:21.400]   Apple employees make $11.25 an hour.
[00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:24.400]   Oh, I am so sorry.
[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:25.400]   Golly.
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:26.400]   Golly G.
[00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:33.400]   There was one thing in there that did resonate, but still, it just...
[00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:35.400]   Well, the issue is...
[00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:37.400]   Sandusky on Sunday was in sports.
[00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:38.400]   Sandusky on Sunday was in sports.
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:39.400]   Yeah, that's crazy.
[00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:45.400]   And this business story, which I think is what you could call it, or if you wanted to be generous, you could call it a technology story.
[00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:49.400]   This business story or technology story was on the front page from the New York Times.
[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:55.400]   And when real things were happening in the world, and I'm not saying that this is not potentially an issue for Apple retail workers,
[00:15:55.400 --> 00:16:01.400]   although if you read the article and you read some of the follow-ups like The Great Peace and 9-5 Mac,
[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:09.400]   there's a survey of some of Apple retail and their reactions both in the New York Times piece and just some other questions.
[00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:14.400]   I mean, they seem to be... they seem to say, you know, it's a job.
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:16.400]   They know what they're getting into.
[00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:26.400]   I'm sure before they take the job, the manager says, and by the way, you'll be getting $11 an hour, and they say, okay, thank you, because you're not flipping burgers.
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:29.400]   You're not stocking boxes of toilet paper.
[00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:34.400]   You're selling... you're selling Macs and iPads to a happy bunch of people.
[00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:40.400]   You know, they're 40,000 Apple employees, they say in this article, 30,000 of them work in Apple retail.
[00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:43.400]   Now, here's the legitimate... I guess legitimate point.
[00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:51.400]   And I just think it's how well run Apple. As Apple is selling... if you do... if you divide the retail store revenue by the number of employees,
[00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:57.400]   each employee brings Apple $473,000 a year.
[00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:02.400]   They're worth that much. Meanwhile, they're getting paid like $30,000 a year.
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:07.400]   And in typical electronics and appliance stores, it's less than half that per employee.
[00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:10.400]   Apple has far more employees. I mean, you walk into a mess by it.
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:13.400]   You're lucky to find one or two people on the floor. Apple has 30 people.
[00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:16.400]   Good point. You can't go into an Apple store without talking to employee.
[00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:21.400]   You actually cannot enter the door. You immediately are accosted.
[00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:26.400]   And they're nice. I mean, I don't mean that in a bad way. They say, "Can we help you? Would you like to make an appointment?
[00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:32.400]   What are you here for?" And in fact, you look at AT&T, they're copying that model now. It's a good model.
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:39.400]   And also, if you're comparing their wages to the wages of Costco, you're comparing them to pretty much the gold standard
[00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:46.400]   for employee compensation. I don't think there's any retail employee that has treated better or paid better than at Costco,
[00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:50.400]   which is why Costco retains employees like nobody's business.
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:58.400]   That said, you do have to... You hope there's at least some sort of a pre-briefing that Apple store employees go through
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:04.400]   that starts and ends with a phrase. You do realize you're going to be working in a mall electronic store.
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:09.400]   You're not going to be part of the design team working for Johnny Ive on the iPhone 7.
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:14.400]   Because sometimes there is a certain rate of burnout in Apple store employees.
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:19.400]   And sometimes there is that disconnect between the idea that it's a great place to work.
[00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:26.400]   The store is run very, very well. You're going to be supported extremely well by management when you need to make decisions
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:31.400]   to satisfy customers. But at the end of the day, you are a retail employee at a mall electronic store.
[00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:38.400]   And if you lose sight of that and you start thinking that you're part of the Apple dream, that's going to lead to heartbreak within six to nine weeks.
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:45.400]   It's funny, every person I've ever met who works in Apple store, the way they introduce themselves is I work for Apple.
[00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:49.400]   Yeah. It is... I don't care. It's still a prestigious job.
[00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:54.400]   By the way, Apple's response to this article was to give a raise to its employees. They won't say how much.
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:19:00.400]   But the Times reports that a salesman in the San Francisco flagship store and vocal labor activist said he was given
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:05.400]   a raise of $2.82 an hour to $17.31 an hour.
[00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:10.400]   You planned for the Times. Sorry. Was it a response? It was in the works for a while.
[00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:19.400]   Oh, okay. This is like when the Times ran its story about the party supply chain after Apple had already joined the FLA.
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:24.400]   Right. And there seemed to be a certain amount of, well, now there's New York Times has shed this light on this.
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:31.400]   Well, I remember reading my first story about how bad things were at Foxconn in 2006, I believe.
[00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:34.400]   Or actually doing my first story on Mac OS can about that in 2006.
[00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:36.400]   And I'm sure they were bad at Foxconn before that.
[00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:42.400]   I mean, the New York Times did not change Apple's. I mean, maybe they're prodding.
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:46.400]   And certainly you can say that looking into it overall does that.
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:51.400]   But it's kind of weird that they ran their expose on the party supply chain right after Apple had said that.
[00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:58.400]   And they ran their plans for giving the raises and the meetings they were had this weekend.
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:01.400]   And those were rumored a couple of weeks ago before this.
[00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:02.400]   They're chasing you.
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:05.400]   And to Ken's point, the title does not match the article.
[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:09.400]   If you read the title, it sounds far more lekbaity than the actual article.
[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:20.400]   And that's my problem with the entire Eye Economy series is that the packaging they are using does a disservice to the material which has social and cultural value that they are trying to push forward.
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:26.400]   There's one other thing that we're skipping over the same way the New York Times article skipped over it.
[00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:31.400]   I mean, Andy, you're right. They're working on electronics and an electronic sealer in the mall.
[00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:37.400]   There's one article that says, but the benefits and the 401K are great.
[00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:38.400]   Yeah.
[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:39.400]   And it's right at the beginning.
[00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:46.400]   And I don't remember having a 20-something job where I could say that those were actually two things that were really great about my job.
[00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:47.400]   Yeah.
[00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:58.400]   I was at TEDx Boston last week and happened to be waiting in a group with a bunch of Apple store employees and talk to them about it.
[00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:07.400]   And they're telling me that they did get a raise that was larger than they were expecting, but it was like a raise that was pretty much on schedule and on track.
[00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:11.400]   And most people that I know the Apple store do have their feet on the ground that way.
[00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:12.400]   I mean, I agree.
[00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:13.400]   It's a non-story.
[00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:22.400]   You never that there's so many I've been in or Jason to meetings where they just were newspaper discusses what goes on the front page.
[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:24.400]   And there's so many different factors that go into it.
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:32.400]   It's with there is a there is a great deal of motivation to get a headline that's going to make people want to pick up the paper and read it.
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:35.400]   But so much of it comes down to well, what did we play up yesterday?
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:38.400]   What story is come was on the way up with stories on the way down?
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:43.400]   What story is going to help us to get eyeballs on other related stories that we've got in play right now?
[00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:54.400]   So I wouldn't I wouldn't necessarily guess as to New York Times as motives, but yeah, I don't think I think I think it's a friend page story for a Sunday papers, not a friend page story for Monday or Tuesday and Wednesday paper.
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:22:05.400]   There is one right for magazines 10 years ago from martial arts magazines and they would say plainly that a magazine with Bruce Lee on the cover would sell 10 times the copies of anything else.
[00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:08.400]   And Apple now is the equivalent of Bruce Lee on the cover.
[00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:09.400]   They get so much attention.
[00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:16.400]   They get so much free marketing, so much free discussion that the equal and opposite negative reaction to that is they put up with stories like this.
[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:17.400]   Yeah.
[00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:21.400]   So next Sunday's New York Times will be where would Bruce Lee be today?
[00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:24.400]   We're here at an Apple store.
[00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:33.400]   I know, you know, I guess I'm I just feel like if you don't like it, get a different job.
[00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:39.400]   And with unemployment, especially among young people so high, I think people are probably fairly happy to have this job.
[00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:41.400]   It's more than minimum wage, a lot more.
[00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:45.400]   Especially the specialists and geniuses get a lot more and they say that in the article too.
[00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:47.400]   And admittedly, it's a stressful job.
[00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:49.400]   I mean, you know, of course, it's stressful.
[00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:50.400]   You go in the Apple store.
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:51.400]   It's it's crazy busy.
[00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:52.400]   I'm sure they work hard.
[00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:54.400]   They work long hours.
[00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:58.400]   You know, is Apple now here's the question and I think this would be more to the point.
[00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:05.400]   I don't see any of this in the article is Apple requiring them to work more hours than they're paid for.
[00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:09.400]   You know, some some retail places like Nordstrom, you stick around afterwards.
[00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:12.400]   You write thank you notes and, you know, off the clock.
[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:15.400]   I mean, if Apple's doing something like that, then I'd like to hear about it.
[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:20.400]   If there was a there was a mention in the article about somebody trying to bring a class action lawsuit
[00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:25.400]   and they were unable to bring a class action lawsuit about whether or not the employees actually got the breaks that they were entitled to.
[00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:32.400]   And so there was a lawyer quoted and I can't remember who he was who said that he was able to get a good settlement for 10 of his plaintiffs.
[00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:35.400]   So, I mean, they I mean, they kind of mentioned that, but not really.
[00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:36.400]   There's one other thing to.
[00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:42.400]   That sounds like innuendo, by the way, that does not sound like a very hard fact.
[00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:46.400]   That's a disappointing innuendo from the nation's newspaper of record.
[00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:48.400]   All the nuisance.
[00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:52.400]   Yeah, there's there's one other thing to keep in mind about Apple retail right now though.
[00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:53.400]   It's in transition.
[00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:55.400]   And they they don't have Ron Johnson anymore.
[00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:59.400]   They do have John Browett who knows what he's going to do with it or what it's going to be like.
[00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:05.400]   But to talk about it right now is like, is like saying, well, that ships crooked, you know, when it's in when it's in a turn.
[00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:10.400]   I mean, it's there is the potential that it's going to change quite a bit.
[00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:11.400]   That's a good line.
[00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:12.400]   I like it.
[00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:13.400]   We don't really know yet.
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:14.400]   Thank you.
[00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:21.400]   I mean, I was I was scared, honestly, when when they said that the guy from Currys and PC world and Dixon's was going to be taking over Apple retail.
[00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:27.400]   But everything that we've heard about what he's done with retail employees so far now, I don't work for Apple Apple retail, obviously.
[00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:35.400]   So I can't say from the inside, but all the articles that were getting coming out of it really sound like he's taking a keen interest in Apple retail employees.
[00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:38.400]   And again, that was sort of that was also a very small part.
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:42.400]   I mean, what what the what the Times piece is looking at is years and that's what they've got.
[00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:43.400]   They've got the history, right?
[00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:47.400]   But I mean, they're there and I'm not looking for a full-up piece on Browett.
[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:57.400]   I guess, though, if they're going to do an assassination piece, maybe they talk about, well, maybe here's one reason that it shouldn't die or here's, you know, here's a bit on why these things, you know, might change or might be different going forward.
[00:24:57.400 --> 00:25:00.400]   Look, I worked at McDonald's when I was that age.
[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:02.400]   There are bad jobs for $5 an hour.
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:04.400]   I can't even it was less than that was 350 an hour.
[00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:05.400]   They're bad jobs.
[00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:07.400]   When you're young, you're starting out.
[00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:11.400]   And I don't think working in an Apple store is is on the level of bad jobs that there are.
[00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:12.400]   There are bad jobs.
[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:15.400]   You could be laying road, you know, asphalt.
[00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:17.400]   You could be working on a roof.
[00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:20.400]   You could be working at Walmart for $9 an hour.
[00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:22.400]   Chad, you could be Chad for Christ's sake.
[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:23.400]   You could work a twit.
[00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:25.400]   This guy, this poor guy, I pay you what?
[00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:27.400]   $3 an hour, no benefits.
[00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:28.400]   And he worked 12 hours a day.
[00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:29.400]   I pay him for eight.
[00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:31.400]   That is a bad job.
[00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:33.400]   Times expose a Sunday on Leola Port.
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:37.400]   [laughter]
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:41.400]   I mean, it's just normal that, you know, that when you're young and starting out, you have bad jobs.
[00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:45.400]   It seems to me a little whiny and it's a little disappointing that the New York Times has run
[00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:50.400]   yet another hit piece as if Apple, I mean, there are far worse employers in America.
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:51.400]   Look at Walmart.
[00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:53.400]   They even mention this.
[00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:55.400]   I mean, come on.
[00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:57.400]   Walmart doesn't give you benefits.
[00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:59.400]   It's $8 an hour.
[00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:00.400]   All right.
[00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:01.400]   All right.
[00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:06.400]   I don't want to defend Apple if they're indefensible, but I just, this seems like a hit piece to me.
[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:07.400]   That's the problem.
[00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:12.400]   The New York Times is making people defend Apple when there could actually be issues with profit
[00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:15.400]   sharing and how the company is run and how retail is run.
[00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:18.400]   And that's the issue with how New York Times is treating us.
[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:25.400]   9 to 5 Mac had a Q&A.
[00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:29.400]   Retail employees respond to New York Times profiles, share life inside the Apple store.
[00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:33.400]   I think this is a good place to go.
[00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:38.400]   Read the Q&A from a 9 to 5 Mac.
[00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:44.000]   That's real Apple employees talking and presumably kind of a random, a good random sampling,
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.160]   not just cheerleaders or whatever.
[00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:49.880]   It's also, by the way, pretty positive.
[00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:53.480]   You know, it's things like my experience is fun, challenging, emotionally, and mentally
[00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:54.480]   rewarding.
[00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:56.120]   I've met, this is another response.
[00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:59.280]   I've met the most impactful people of my life while working at Apple and far many ongoing
[00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:02.400]   friendships working at Apple's probably friends that would otherwise have known.
[00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:05.400]   I mean, it's like, you know, this is a good first job, I think.
[00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:09.400]   And I don't think these people are, you know, 40-year-olds for the most part.
[00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:10.400]   They're kids.
[00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:11.400]   They're 20-some-
[00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:13.400]   It doesn't look bad on a resume.
[00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:15.400]   Yeah, that was the other thing that they kept saying.
[00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:18.400]   And, I mean, they did actually mention that in the New York Times piece.
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:21.800]   It's weird because the New York Times piece does seem very slanted against Apple or at
[00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:25.400]   least against the way Apple has treated it to retail employees.
[00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:30.200]   But, I mean, you do have people saying, "Yeah, you know, I have three years of Apple under
[00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:31.200]   my belt."
[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:33.200]   And even though it's retail, what people see is Apple.
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:35.920]   And they're impressed that they got in, they're impressed that they were able to stay, and
[00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:37.480]   then they were able to go on and make more money.
[00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:38.480]   I think that's true.
[00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:42.440]   I mean, it's a much, like you said, it's a much better for, how did that McDonald's
[00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:44.520]   stint do for you, Leo, on your resume?
[00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:45.520]   I mean, it's a much more--
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:46.520]   Good to know my resume.
[00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:49.200]   But, you know, actually, I learned to work at McDonald's.
[00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:52.560]   I mean, that was a good first job for me.
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:54.280]   One of the things I learned is you're always doing something.
[00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:55.280]   You're always working.
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:56.280]   You're always tidying up.
[00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:57.280]   You're cleaning.
[00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:58.280]   You're doing something.
[00:27:58.280 --> 00:27:59.280]   I learned to be responsible.
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:00.520]   I was actually a great first job.
[00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:02.920]   I was from 16 to 18, something like that.
[00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:04.560]   And it was a very good first job.
[00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:08.320]   And I came home smelling like Greece and exhausted.
[00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:12.920]   And I learned to hate people.
[00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:17.440]   And I gained about 40 pounds because I kept eating those damn big Macs.
[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:18.440]   But other than that--
[00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:22.440]   Honestly, I wasn't knocking the job at McDonald's.
[00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:24.440]   No, it was a good job.
[00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:25.440]   Difficult work, right.
[00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:28.480]   But it's not something that you put on your resume necessarily thinking, "Well, this is
[00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:29.480]   going to get me in the door."
[00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:30.480]   No, it didn't.
[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:35.840]   And what both the 9 to 5 Mac piece and the New York Times piece had Apple retail employees,
[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:39.960]   or former Apple retail employees saying was, "Yeah, this looks great on my resume.
[00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:41.520]   Maybe I didn't enjoy it every day.
[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:42.520]   Maybe I should have made more money."
[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:46.440]   And of course, ideally, you want everybody to make more money.
[00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:49.600]   I mean, that's-- but it's not like the Walmart thing.
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:51.520]   It's not like the $8 an hour.
[00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:52.520]   And you get no benefits.
[00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:54.960]   Or you get no benefits for the first year.
[00:28:54.960 --> 00:29:00.920]   There are a lot of worse jobs as all I'm saying.
[00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:04.160]   And I bet you most of the people who get jobs at Apple stores are happy to be there.
[00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:05.880]   For a couple of years, it's not a career.
[00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:08.160]   You're happy to be there for a few years and you move on.
[00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:09.160]   It's like working a twin.
[00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:10.600]   I swear to God.
[00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:11.600]   It's exactly the same.
[00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:14.120]   Why do you think I hire young people?
[00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:16.120]   No sane adult would work here.
[00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:17.840]   Same amount of Apple equipment in this work.
[00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:19.520]   I got some volunteers.
[00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:22.760]   Hey, one good thing about the New York Times.
[00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:29.360]   You're going to bring starting Thursday the entire paper to the flip board and the pay
[00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:30.360]   wall too, by the way.
[00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:34.280]   You still have to be a paying subscriber.
[00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:36.480]   But I subscribed to the New York Times.
[00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:41.360]   I'm not-- I didn't call up saying, "I'm canceling my subscription."
[00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:42.640]   I still like it.
[00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:44.840]   And I love the idea that I'll be able to read it on flip board.
[00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:48.960]   It's interesting, though, because it sounds as if almost the times of saying our digital
[00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:52.840]   strategy as a standalone app didn't work.
[00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:56.000]   Maybe flip board is the right thing to do.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.200]   Is that what you're saying, Andy?
[00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:02.720]   I think it's more of a case of them saying we won eyeballs wherever they are.
[00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:06.840]   And given that flip board has become one of the most dominant media apps on the iPad,
[00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:10.480]   which is the dominant e-reader device on the market right now, it makes sense for them
[00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:11.480]   to do that.
[00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:14.680]   Also, flip board has done a really great job of making their platform accessible to other
[00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:15.680]   magazines.
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:16.680]   As everybody knows.
[00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:17.680]   And the audio was like--
[00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:22.520]   Yeah, I mean, it's just amazing start to finish.
[00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:27.240]   You have a site like Bloing Bloing or a publication like Wired who wants to take the effort to
[00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:30.520]   make a better reading experience for flip board users.
[00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:34.880]   It doesn't take a whole lot of work on their own end to make that happen.
[00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:39.600]   And suddenly, it increases the value of flip board, increases the value of the magazine.
[00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:43.400]   So this is just nothing but a win-win for the New York Times.
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:46.200]   They're investing a hell of a lot of money in New Media right now.
[00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:55.400]   They had-- I was told about a software product that they put a seven-figure budget into,
[00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:58.840]   but then had a sort of can when the iPad came out because they were planning on different
[00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:00.880]   forms of digital distribution.
[00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:03.380]   Some of them key to custom hardware.
[00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:08.320]   Some of them key to a different content platform so they could redeploy it wherever they wanted
[00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:09.480]   to.
[00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:13.400]   And it's impressive that they took that big of a gamble, also impressive that they flush
[00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:17.360]   that amount of money away if that story is true.
[00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:21.720]   The source is pretty good, but I didn't actually get to see the actual thing.
[00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:26.200]   So it doesn't surprise me that this is just another extension of a larger policy of wherever
[00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:27.200]   the eyeballs are.
[00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:30.000]   We want to make sure that they can land on a copy of the New York Times.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.120]   Too bad about the paywall, but yeah.
[00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:33.760]   They actually-- you're exactly right.
[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:35.760]   They call it an "NYT" everywhere.
[00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:37.640]   It's their digital strategy.
[00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:38.640]   And that makes sense.
[00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:40.640]   I think that was always our strategy.
[00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:45.600]   Why not be everywhere your readers or listeners or viewers want to see you?
[00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:48.000]   Those are the paywall with it.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   It's almost like the cable companies who would rather not have a TV channel app on the iPad.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.720]   They would rather you log in with your cable company ID.
[00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:58.160]   They want the exposure, but they don't want to lose a traditional cash system that's attached
[00:31:58.160 --> 00:31:59.160]   to it.
[00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:02.200]   Well, actually the case of HBO, I think it's because they have to.
[00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:05.640]   I think they would love to sell it to you directly, but they can't.
[00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:07.720]   Yeah, there are a lot of complications there.
[00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:12.000]   Among them, it really works well for HBO to make that available through Verizon, through
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.400]   Comcast, because that way Verizon and Comcast are responsible for piping that content to
[00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:17.400]   the user.
[00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:22.000]   Whereas if HBO were to attach that, now they have to figure out who are they going to subcontract
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.800]   that job to how they're going to make it reliable.
[00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:26.720]   Do they really want that kind of trouble?
[00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:33.080]   All for the interests of hoping to build a brand new business that within five to ten
[00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:39.800]   years would only poison their immediate relationships with existing cable companies.
[00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:44.320]   It's a complicated issue of the best way for newspapers to get people to pay for their
[00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:45.320]   content.
[00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:49.160]   New York Times is in a position where they can actually make a strategy like this work.
[00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:52.360]   There really is only one New York Times, just like there really is only one Wall Street
[00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:54.360]   Journal.
[00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:58.600]   They don't have the same problems that a Boston Globe or a Seattle pie or a Chicago
[00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:02.440]   or a Sun Times would have, where if the Sun Times went exclusively behind a paywall,
[00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:03.440]   well, who cares?
[00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:07.280]   There are a million other places they can get not the same content, not the same sort of
[00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:11.360]   stellar, wonderful research Pulitzer Prize winning content, including commentators such
[00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:18.040]   as the world's never around Roger Ebert and the slightly less renowned Andy Nacho.
[00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:19.840]   But you know what I mean?
[00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:22.880]   New York Times is pursuing this because it's a viable idea for them.
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:29.440]   And I think actually in an absolutely perfect world, the newspaper business with complete
[00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:36.280]   foresight would have probably been better suited if they said we would rather create
[00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:42.000]   a distinction between the sort of content that's created on the web for free versus
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.040]   the sort of stuff that we want to ask you to pay for.
[00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:50.120]   I think that they made sort of a structural problem by saying that everything that's
[00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:53.400]   on the web is just as good as everything else on the web and that really isn't actually
[00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:54.400]   true.
[00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:55.800]   There's no other answer they could have made.
[00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:59.120]   I mean, I'm not saying that they should have done that to begin with, but I don't really
[00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:02.580]   think that the New York Times is necessarily backwards by putting everything behind a
[00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:04.080]   paywall.
[00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:07.000]   It's really a big victory for Flipboard.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.200]   Flipboard recently added audio from NPR.
[00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:17.560]   They added Google+, because really initially Flipboard was Twitter's feeds kind of magazineified.
[00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:20.120]   And now it's got Google+, it's got actual magazines.
[00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:21.520]   I look at what the New Yorker's doing.
[00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:25.720]   The New Yorker's free, but it's the same basic content, not from their Twitter feed, but
[00:34:25.720 --> 00:34:28.160]   it's on their webpage and you can see it's branded and everything.
[00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:29.960]   What is that say about in New Stanley?
[00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:33.840]   Are you not going to go to Newstand anymore and just go directly to Flipboard?
[00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:34.840]   That's how I do it.
[00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:37.760]   I don't even go, you know, that's how I read Tech meme.
[00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:42.680]   I don't even go to the web anymore, you know, and I think what it does is it changes and
[00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:48.160]   yeah, Flipboard on the iPhone and Andy showing it on Android, that's the Samsung Galaxy S3.
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:52.360]   And it's just by the way, on Android is exactly the same incredible experience.
[00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:53.360]   It's really nice.
[00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:54.360]   Same thing.
[00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:55.360]   Yeah.
[00:34:55.360 --> 00:35:00.080]   Of course, they're still having a wait and see attitude on me, brooming to Android tablets.
[00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:03.280]   But once they make that transition, boy, that'll be a big step.
[00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:08.160]   And I've set it up so that I can now, this is kind of now getting a little weird because
[00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:12.400]   I used to be able to on Flipboard retweet and I have a special, what I've set it up is
[00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:16.960]   a special Twitter account, links for Twitch, links underscore 400 score, Twitter, and by
[00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:21.600]   retweeting it, it would then be sucked up by pinboard, which is our bookmarking app
[00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:23.640]   and shared and it would become part of our rundown.
[00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:25.880]   So that's a nice workflow for me.
[00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:29.160]   But it's interesting because if, and this is a little disappointing, if you go to Google
[00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:31.800]   Plus, they, I guess it makes sense.
[00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:34.240]   They don't have a retweet button on Google Plus.
[00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:36.240]   They have a Google Plus one button.
[00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:38.760]   So I can no longer broke my workflow.
[00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:43.520]   And I hope Flipboard doesn't do that where they reach out to these publishers.
[00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:46.800]   And then the publishers customize Flipboard in such a way that it's really not the same
[00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:49.640]   experience on all the tiles.
[00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:50.640]   That will be a little disappointing.
[00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:54.840]   Google Plus is in there when they have a Google Currents product as well on iOS.
[00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:59.280]   Yeah, this is, this current is their kind of fake Flipboard.
[00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:03.720]   This is some, this Flipboard, I think is this with the New York Times now, I mean, I think
[00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:06.640]   these changes make Flipboard the app to beat at this point.
[00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:12.560]   They are the kind of the iPhone of news reading apps, don't you think?
[00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:13.560]   Absolutely.
[00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:15.720]   So the question is, who's going to buy them?
[00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:17.280]   Yeah, that's interesting.
[00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:19.920]   And there have been a lot of rumors about that.
[00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:24.320]   But they would, they would be in a really bad position to, I'm sorry, it would be a stupid
[00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:26.160]   move for them to be bought out.
[00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:30.640]   Given that they're one of those few startups where they have a terribly viable business
[00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:36.200]   on their hands, given that they are the printing presses for that every single, that a publication
[00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:39.480]   as prestigious as the New York Times is clamoring to work with.
[00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:43.480]   It seems as though the smartest thing to do to make sure that they don't get screwed
[00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:46.320]   is to make sure that they get to control their own destiny.
[00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:47.320]   Yeah.
[00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:54.640]   I agree, but when somebody comes along with a hundred million or billion dollars, the crazy
[00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:57.440]   stupid money, they'd be crazy stupid to turn it down.
[00:36:57.440 --> 00:37:03.000]   But wasn't, didn't we all read that really cool article about, about the, what happened
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:07.920]   to Flickr after it was absorbed by Yahoo and suddenly had to become an arm that supported
[00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:13.920]   the interests of Yahoo instead of growing to be the Instagram of all mobile users.
[00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:18.520]   So I could just see a million different ways in which, in which a flip board would absolutely
[00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:22.080]   die if it were ever purchased by Google or purchased by somebody else.
[00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:24.840]   Well, you already see that with Google+ integration.
[00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:28.120]   You could also see a bunch of old media saying, no, seriously, this is where it's going, we
[00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:29.120]   need to buy it.
[00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:30.120]   I mean, couldn't you?
[00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:31.120]   Yeah.
[00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:33.520]   There are plenty of ways that they could screw it up when it's done.
[00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:37.840]   But I mean, at the beginning, they say, I'm sure Mike, we've got this much money.
[00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:38.840]   Let's do it.
[00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:42.240]   I'm sure Mike, MQ is fighting off offers all the time right now, the guy, the guy, the
[00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:43.400]   flip board.
[00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:49.960]   But how many media companies would be willing to use flip board successfully for their own
[00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:50.960]   specific uses?
[00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:56.200]   They certainly wouldn't want you to, they, a competing wire service or computing communication
[00:37:56.200 --> 00:38:00.560]   service would not want a flip board to help out New York Times would not want to flip
[00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:04.120]   board to help out non-clear channel outlets.
[00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:07.400]   And I think flip board would be smart enough to say unless there was that crazy stupid
[00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:09.040]   offer, but there will be.
[00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:14.120]   We would much rather take $5 off of every single human being on the planet than take
[00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:19.120]   $1,000 from 10 people who probably are not going to be good for that money eight months
[00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:20.120]   from now.
[00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:23.000]   And that's the state of many conglomerated communications companies.
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:27.800]   If Facebook would pay a billion dollars for Instagram, see, that's what it was going to
[00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:28.800]   say.
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:29.800]   How much is flip board?
[00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:31.320]   I'm not arguing that it's a good idea.
[00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:34.080]   I'm not arguing that it would be good for flip board or for the consumers.
[00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:36.400]   I'm saying there's a lot of dumb money out there.
[00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:39.560]   And this is one that's pretty obvious.
[00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:44.240]   What I'm just going to say is flip board celebrates the best of the app economy.
[00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:49.800]   If you do an app that is beautiful, that is elegant, that really redefines the user
[00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:55.000]   interface and initially flip board did not have content relationships, they just kind
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.240]   of said, we're going to do it.
[00:38:57.240 --> 00:38:59.880]   And very quickly they developed these relationships.
[00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:05.000]   It was that or die because of course they're scraping Twitter initially.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   But it was so gorgeous.
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:11.440]   And it just shows if you have a great idea and you can execute, path is another example,
[00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:16.160]   you can execute well, there is no entrenched interest that you can't beat.
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:21.360]   I mean, what happened to Zinnio and all these great, some, you know, let's not say great
[00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:25.560]   incumbent magazine racks that could have done it and didn't.
[00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:28.960]   Well, also you have to make so many smart decisions early on.
[00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:33.440]   I was talking to the developers of it like the week before it was released for a story.
[00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:36.760]   And they were very, very clear about how they felt as though the entire system would
[00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:40.160]   absolutely fail if they made enemies out of content providers.
[00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:44.440]   They needed to be able to have that face to face discussion with every single blogger,
[00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:49.640]   every single commercial website too and say, no, we're going to help you get eyeballs to
[00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:50.640]   your articles.
[00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:53.680]   And that's why it doesn't scrape any content whatsoever.
[00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:56.800]   It'll grab the first paragraph, paragraph and a half.
[00:39:56.800 --> 00:40:01.160]   But the whole point of it is to feed you, to feed the reader all the way back into the
[00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:03.920]   original webpage so that they will get those ad impressions.
[00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:08.480]   They will get the Google hits that they need.
[00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:13.960]   And I haven't been talking to, there's a lot of debate about how much the flip board effect
[00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:15.880]   is helping all these different sites.
[00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:20.560]   But I don't know any commercial operator who isn't very, very grateful for all the traffic
[00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:21.560]   that flip board brings them.
[00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:24.760]   So that was an absolutely critical hit for them to make.
[00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:26.440]   And it can be done wrong.
[00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:30.120]   I remember readability that collected money.
[00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:31.120]   Yeah.
[00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:34.360]   In fact, I thought I paid them money because I thought, oh, this is good because the idea
[00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:37.320]   was readability, which is like Instapaper or read it later.
[00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:43.720]   It was a place you would send articles to read later in a nice form, a magazine style.
[00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:46.480]   And they asked for money and they said, we'll give it to the authors.
[00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:48.960]   And they pissed John Gruber off.
[00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:52.440]   They pissed all these authors off because they said, Gruber said, they're collecting money
[00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:53.440]   for me.
[00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:54.440]   They didn't ask me.
[00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:56.440]   They're not giving it to me.
[00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:58.560]   Yeah, forced agency.
[00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:02.360]   So it shows you can do it wrong.
[00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:09.040]   Meanwhile, Marco Arment is beloved by publishers because Instapaper does it better.
[00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:10.800]   I guess does it right?
[00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:11.800]   I don't know.
[00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:16.160]   So there's still people are upset with him because it's not a scraper per se.
[00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:20.640]   It's just a different kind of web browser, but it does make it harder for webmasters
[00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:24.080]   to web operators to track what's happening.
[00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:25.080]   That's where you're right.
[00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:26.080]   Flipboard did it exact.
[00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:27.600]   Knew that this was an issue.
[00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:28.600]   Yeah.
[00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:31.280]   And I think I do think Instapaper does it in a harmless way.
[00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:35.560]   I mean, it's such a great idea for an app that you kind of have to do it.
[00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:39.040]   And there's no way getting around that kind of problem.
[00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:43.720]   And honestly, if you are upset with the idea of the content of your website being viewed
[00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:48.920]   by an alternative browser that might strip out the ads, you're going to have to invest
[00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:51.520]   in different infrastructure that makes that harder to do.
[00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:55.520]   And it's interesting that you have Instapaper and you have pocket and you have readability,
[00:41:55.520 --> 00:41:57.520]   but your flipboard is really differentiates itself.
[00:41:57.520 --> 00:41:58.520]   It's by itself.
[00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:01.520]   There's no none of the immediate competitors are competitive at this point.
[00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:02.520]   But there are.
[00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:07.640]   I mean, like as you said, current, which is Google Plus's response, there's pulse, but
[00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:09.320]   none of them have the UI.
[00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:10.320]   That's the thing.
[00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:11.320]   The UI is what it looks like.
[00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:16.800]   In addition to the UI, they hired a fantastic designer to make sure that it looked like
[00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:17.800]   a magazine.
[00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:19.200]   It looked like e-text.
[00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:22.880]   That was what everybody went gaga over when they first saw it.
[00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:24.920]   This wasn't just an RSS feed.
[00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:27.360]   This wasn't just Google Reader with some better fonts.
[00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:33.240]   If you hired some person to actually lay out these articles into a magazine format, they
[00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:36.680]   would probably give you something that was very, very similar, if not identical to what
[00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:37.920]   you got with flipboard.
[00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:43.040]   There's so many basic decisions that were spot on that made this the success that it
[00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:44.040]   is.
[00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:45.040]   It's all in the details.
[00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:46.040]   You know, flipping is delightful.
[00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:49.440]   I mean, you have a good user experience performance is fantastic.
[00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:51.120]   That's a good word delightful.
[00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:54.520]   If you can make an app that's delightful, you got something.
[00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:58.640]   Instagram was delightful, immediately delightful, like you go, oh, I feel good.
[00:42:58.640 --> 00:42:59.880]   And you want to do it again.
[00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:01.240]   Yeah, I want to do it again.
[00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:02.240]   That's right.
[00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:05.520]   I got to ask a question to see if I'm the only idiot here.
[00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:09.920]   Sometimes when you're reading a real magazine, you'll be turning a page, but you might spot
[00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:10.920]   something on the page.
[00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:12.440]   You didn't see before you started turning it.
[00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:14.400]   So you sort of turn your head to see it.
[00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:15.720]   Sometimes I do that with flipboard too.
[00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:17.760]   I'll start turning the page and I'll see a tweet.
[00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:21.240]   And actually, even though it makes no sense, I'll cock my head like this.
[00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:25.120]   As though I'm actually physically turning a page.
[00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:27.120]   That's how well designed this app is.
[00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:28.120]   Bingo.
[00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:32.240]   And Jayce Calhoun is saying in a chat, "My thought skeomorphism was bad.
[00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:35.240]   I don't think flipboards skew morphic at all.
[00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:40.240]   If you had stitching, leather, and a page turn, maybe there's not a page turn on this.
[00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:42.240]   There's no fake skeomorphism."
[00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:43.480]   This stuff is all very deliberate.
[00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:45.080]   I mean, they want to move you through the app.
[00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:46.080]   It's digital.
[00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:47.080]   Very specific way.
[00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:48.080]   Yeah, it's really authentic.
[00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:49.080]   And that's why it works.
[00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:50.840]   It's native to digital.
[00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:52.080]   You can't do this in paper.
[00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:53.080]   It's native.
[00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:54.240]   That's what you want.
[00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:57.280]   And by the way, Andy, I think you'll agree, it really is nice on Android.
[00:43:57.280 --> 00:44:01.320]   I think that there was an exclusive with the Galaxy S3 initially, but I do believe you
[00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:03.160]   can get this now for all Android phones.
[00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:04.680]   Yeah, it's released for everything.
[00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:06.600]   It's just the same.
[00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:11.640]   In fact, in some ways, I like the iPhone, Android, up flip a little bit better.
[00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:13.200]   It just seems more, it's something about it.
[00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:14.200]   It just fits that.
[00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:17.440]   Again, it's native to the platform.
[00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:19.040]   Really nicely done.
[00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:21.520]   Really, really well done.
[00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:23.480]   And look what I found on Flipboard.
[00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:27.360]   Woman hit with milkshake loses $2,000.
[00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:29.640]   This is not a Mac story, but this is a great story.
[00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:34.000]   A woman who was struck with a milkshake, a bunch of teenagers drove by through a milkshake
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   at her.
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.080]   She threw her handbag at them.
[00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:40.080]   It flew in the window and they drove off.
[00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:43.800]   She had $2,000 in it.
[00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:48.920]   The alligator skin person, the money is gone.
[00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:52.720]   Well, that was rather impetuous.
[00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:53.720]   One, two, three.
[00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:55.960]   They threw a milkshake at her.
[00:44:55.960 --> 00:45:02.280]   She threw a person at them and flies in the window and they got it.
[00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:03.280]   I'm sorry.
[00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:05.200]   I shouldn't laugh.
[00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:11.240]   But who carries $2,000 in their alligator skin purse after all?
[00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:12.440]   But they shouldn't throw kids.
[00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:14.280]   Don't throw milkshakes at your elders.
[00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:17.560]   They've been watching too much glee or something.
[00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:19.800]   Hey, I've been doing it slowly.
[00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:20.800]   It's bit by bit.
[00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:25.120]   I finally got all our stuff off of that other domain registrar.
[00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:29.360]   It was pulling teeth literally because they lock you in and you got to wrench it out of
[00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:30.360]   them.
[00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:33.000]   I finally got all the domains moved over to hover.com.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:36.600]   This is domain registration, refreshing domain.
[00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:37.600]   Done right.
[00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:38.600]   It's smooth.
[00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:39.600]   It's easy.
[00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:40.600]   It's elegant.
[00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:41.600]   They don't upsell you.
[00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:44.800]   In fact, one of the things most of the other registrars, you buy the thing.
[00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:46.040]   Oh, it's only $8.
[00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:48.960]   By the way, you know everybody could see your address on the internet.
[00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:50.560]   Would you like to buy privacy?
[00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:51.800]   No, hover.
[00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:53.440]   It's all part of it.
[00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:54.440]   You get the privacy.
[00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:55.440]   You get the domain management.
[00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:59.080]   They're not upselling because they don't sell web hosting.
[00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:00.960]   They sell domain name registration.
[00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:02.280]   I want you to try hover.
[00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:03.840]   Oh, they've redesigned the site.
[00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:04.840]   Look at that.
[00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:06.840]   Hover.com.
[00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:10.520]   A very nice transfer process, by the way.
[00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:14.160]   I wish I had done their concierge service.
[00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:15.920]   You could transfer them by hand if you want.
[00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:17.520]   That's what I did.
[00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:20.520]   Or for, I think it's $25.
[00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:22.360]   They'll transfer all your domains for you.
[00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:29.880]   Although, my sense is if you call this number in the upper right hand corner 86731-6556,
[00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:33.480]   if you call that number and say, "Hey, Leo said you'd help me transfer my domain, so
[00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:35.400]   do it for free."
[00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:36.400]   They have been doing that.
[00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:38.800]   I should not make offers for them.
[00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:44.480]   Now you do pay $10 for transferring the domain, but you get an additional year for the $10
[00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:47.960]   so it's a good deal.
[00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:49.720]   And of course, all the existing time left.
[00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:52.920]   So if you've got half a year left, you get a year and a half for $10.
[00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:55.520]   That's a great deal.
[00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:57.160]   And you get the Domain Valet service.
[00:46:57.160 --> 00:46:59.720]   You get the one-year domain registration.
[00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:02.840]   You get the domain management tools, the no-weight telephone support.
[00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:07.680]   If you reach them during regular business hours, and once you get online, they will
[00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:08.680]   finish the call.
[00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:11.880]   Then we'll transfer you over to somebody or put you on hold.
[00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:16.360]   They now have domains in addition to the .com.net.co.ca.org.
[00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:21.560]   They've got a number of country-specific ones like .it.
[00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:26.920]   We really try to get TW.it, but they won't do a two-letter, unfortunately.
[00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:30.360]   They've got .asia.es.us.de.pro.
[00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:33.880]   I like that.
[00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:34.880]   Leo.pro.
[00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:36.240]   I like that.
[00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:37.600]   Somebody's probably got it.
[00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:39.000]   Triple X.
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:41.880]   What could I put on a domain, Leo. triple X?
[00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:42.880]   .tv.
[00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:46.120]   I want you to visit hover.com.
[00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:50.880]   And by the way, when you go to Macbreak.com and when you register your domain, use the
[00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:51.880]   offer code Macbreak.
[00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:56.960]   You'll get 10% off your first purchase at hover.com.
[00:47:56.960 --> 00:47:58.840]   I'm a big fan.
[00:47:58.840 --> 00:47:59.840]   It's just clean.
[00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:00.840]   It's just simple.
[00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:04.280]   It's just straightforward from the folks at Tukows who have kind of taken as their mission
[00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:12.080]   to take these difficult environments like cell phones and domain registration.
[00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:16.880]   Just make it clean, easy, straightforward.
[00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:17.880]   Macbreak.hover.com.
[00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:19.280]   Try it today.
[00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:25.000]   And don't forget to use the offer code Macbreak to save 10%.
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:30.880]   So Apple bought Chomp, which was an app recommendation service.
[00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:33.960]   Apparently, somebody explained this to me.
[00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:37.360]   Renee, can you explain that they incorporate it into this search?
[00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:41.920]   Because developers are saying the search results are better now.
[00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:45.280]   You don't know if it's actually Chomp technology they're using, but they seem to have changed
[00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:49.720]   the algorithm before it was weighted heavily on what the title of the app was and what
[00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:50.720]   the keywords were.
[00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:54.880]   So even if it wasn't really relevant to your search, if you were looking for an app, you
[00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:58.120]   might get a game just because the same title was in there.
[00:48:58.120 --> 00:49:02.880]   And now it seems to be weighing the number of downloads, the ratings, perhaps a lot,
[00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:07.760]   a greater stretch of factors in presenting apps to you when you search for them.
[00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:08.760]   Good.
[00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:16.040]   So TechCrunch quotes Ben Sand, who has a best parking app.
[00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:20.040]   He said suddenly he's at the top of searches, including things like Chicago parking, DC
[00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:24.520]   parking, SF parking.
[00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:28.240]   And he's ranking ahead of other apps with names that match more closely.
[00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:32.560]   So he thinks Apple's now putting emphasis on downloads.
[00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:38.680]   So the more downloads you have, the more likely you'll show up in an appropriate search.
[00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:40.440]   It's more contextually aware.
[00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:43.560]   If you're looking for Chicago parking, it guesses that you're not looking for a game
[00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:44.560]   that just has parking.
[00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:45.560]   It's a title.
[00:49:45.560 --> 00:49:46.560]   Thank God.
[00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:47.560]   Yeah.
[00:49:47.560 --> 00:49:48.560]   Absolutely.
[00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:50.320]   And apparently this is what Chomp did.
[00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:55.960]   According to Chomp's description, quote, "Chomp's proprietary algorithm learns the functions
[00:49:55.960 --> 00:50:02.880]   and topics of apps so you can search based on what apps do, not what they're called."
[00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:04.880]   Apple has not commented on this as usual.
[00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:05.880]   They don't want any way.
[00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:09.880]   They don't want to be able to do it.
[00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:11.880]   They don't want to be able to do it.
[00:50:11.880 --> 00:50:13.880]   They don't want to be able to do it.
[00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:15.880]   They don't want to be able to do it.
[00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:17.880]   They don't want to be able to do it.
[00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:19.880]   They don't want to be able to do it.
[00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:21.880]   They don't want to be able to do it.
[00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:23.880]   They don't want to be able to do it.
[00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:25.880]   They don't want to be able to do it.
[00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:27.880]   They don't want to be able to do it.
[00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:29.880]   They don't want to be able to do it.
[00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:31.880]   They don't want to be able to do it.
[00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:33.880]   They don't want to be able to do it.
[00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:37.880]   It was hard to find Apple apps on occasion, which is kind of stupefying.
[00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:39.880]   I have one question.
[00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:44.120]   I don't know if anybody knows yet because it's so new, but where you're saying it's
[00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:47.640]   weighted pretty heavily on ratings and on downloads.
[00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:50.120]   What does this do for discoverability?
[00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:55.000]   Is there anything sort of -- and I'm not looking for a reason to beat up on Apple or beat up
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:58.680]   on the app store or anything like that, but it almost feels like it gets a little bit
[00:50:58.680 --> 00:51:02.840]   harder now because if the one trick that you had was coming up with a cool name or a name
[00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:06.760]   that was really going to say to people what it is, if that trick doesn't work any more,
[00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:10.600]   then what does that do for discoverability going forward?
[00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:11.600]   Right.
[00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:12.800]   How do you break through with it?
[00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:18.120]   There's a lot of entrenched incumbents and it makes it definitely harder.
[00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:19.640]   It's discoverably different.
[00:51:19.640 --> 00:51:22.960]   It'll be hard to tell if it's better or worse until we've used it for a while and a lot
[00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:24.400]   of people hammer on it.
[00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:29.480]   But absolutely, before, if you had the name, read it later, it would show up because it's
[00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:30.480]   a very apt name.
[00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:33.280]   But now it's going to weigh a lot of factors.
[00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:37.840]   I think the breakthrough apps will have a hard of time.
[00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:39.480]   I just got Leo.pro.
[00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:45.360]   I'm sorry.
[00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:48.440]   Ken Ray is here from Mac OS Ken.
[00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:49.440]   It's MacOSKen.com.
[00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:51.400]   It's a great podcast.
[00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:52.400]   Every -- oh, no.
[00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:59.440]   Somebody got Leo.pro in the time of -- Chatham told me -- you guys, you're too fast for me.
[00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:03.880]   I can get L-E-L-M-O.com for $1,500.
[00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:06.800]   Why would I want L-L-M-O?
[00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:08.280]   L-L-M-O.com.
[00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:10.080]   Leo's MacBook.pro.
[00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:12.880]   Now we got it.
[00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:14.880]   Tech Leo.pro is available.
[00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:16.880]   Leohost.pro.
[00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:19.000]   Leo -- When they put that screen up.
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:20.000]   Yeah.
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:21.000]   It's all gone now.
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:23.720]   How about fire Leo.pro?
[00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:25.040]   Chad?
[00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:29.840]   How much is that?
[00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:30.840]   $15?
[00:52:30.840 --> 00:52:35.040]   Need a five minute domain registration delay on the feed.
[00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:37.760]   Yeah, really.
[00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:40.280]   Here's a rumor from CNET.
[00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:43.680]   Three iPad model lineup could cut entry price to $2.99.
[00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:46.920]   I don't -- this is Josh Lowensen writing in CNET.
[00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:48.440]   Oh, this is from January.
[00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:49.440]   Who sent me this?
[00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:51.080]   Get out of here.
[00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:52.080]   That's old news.
[00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:56.080]   I think it's come up again because of the Rupert Nexus tablet for $200.
[00:52:56.080 --> 00:52:58.240]   It's going to probably be announced this week.
[00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:03.320]   Apple -- I don't think Renee Apple wants to chase that down to the bottom.
[00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:06.800]   I did not believe it, but we have a really, really good source that is saying Apple has
[00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:13.480]   a seven inch iPad ready to go $200 to $250 and they're likely to release it in October.
[00:53:13.480 --> 00:53:14.480]   Really?
[00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:15.480]   Yes.
[00:53:15.480 --> 00:53:17.280]   Just for that reason, like an iPad mini market.
[00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:20.160]   Well, it wouldn't just be the Nexus.
[00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:24.600]   Google's rumor to be releasing and I think it's a pretty accurate rumor.
[00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:27.400]   A tablet built by -- was it Asus or Acer?
[00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:28.400]   Yes.
[00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:29.400]   Asus.
[00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:30.400]   Asus.
[00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:31.400]   A seven inch tablet by Asus.
[00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:35.000]   They showed it earlier this year and then it disappeared magically.
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:38.480]   At Google I/O, we will know we're going to do coverage, live coverage of Google I/O
[00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:44.760]   930 AM Pacific 1230 Eastern time on Wednesday.
[00:53:44.760 --> 00:53:46.000]   And Gina Trapani will be there.
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:49.160]   So maybe she'll come back with one of those because usually they do that.
[00:53:49.160 --> 00:53:51.160]   They put them under the seat or something.
[00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:52.160]   Yeah.
[00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:53.160]   But I agree.
[00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:54.160]   I can see it.
[00:53:54.160 --> 00:54:00.680]   Well, it depends on how firmly you believe in the canard that Apple doesn't care about
[00:54:00.680 --> 00:54:01.680]   the competition.
[00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:05.520]   They only care about what's -- what making awesome products that are best for Apple.
[00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:09.840]   I think that's absolutely true, but I think they also realize that the only leverage that
[00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:14.560]   any other tablet manufacturer has is a seven inch tablet that costs a lot less money.
[00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:15.560]   I think they would do it.
[00:54:15.560 --> 00:54:19.360]   And not this is not even just to slam the door on the competition, but also because the
[00:54:19.360 --> 00:54:24.600]   fact that these tablets are so popular truly demonstrates that consumers want this sort
[00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:25.600]   of device.
[00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:28.880]   If they're making any sort of a vote about what they don't like about the iPad, they're
[00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:33.480]   voting that it kind of stinks to have this device that as wonderful as it is makes me
[00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:35.480]   carry around a special little bag for it.
[00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:41.480]   They also -- it's -- it's -- I've had iPads for over two years now and I'm still at a
[00:54:41.480 --> 00:54:46.200]   loss to explain in one sentence what it is that an iPad does.
[00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:51.280]   So people are defining seven inch Android tablets as these are little media devices
[00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:56.000]   that are relatively affordable relative to a notebook computer that allow me to read books,
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:59.360]   surf the web, get email, run some nice apps and some play some games.
[00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:03.240]   That's -- it's not there to challenge any desktop OS I have, but it certainly has -- it's
[00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:04.440]   interesting niche.
[00:55:04.440 --> 00:55:08.800]   So Apple could certainly be looking at the sales figures on the Kindle Fire and say
[00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:12.520]   that maybe this is something that maybe we're leaving money on the table by not catering
[00:55:12.520 --> 00:55:13.520]   to this market.
[00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:16.600]   I think that they'd be smart enough though not to call it an iPad mini.
[00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:20.840]   I think they would actually call it an iPad touch, maximum or pro maximum.
[00:55:20.840 --> 00:55:22.280]   >> Well, interestingly, we --
[00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:25.680]   >> Yeah, the ad nodal iPod touch.
[00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:28.600]   >> As soon as we heard the story, we asked about the iPod touch because it hasn't really
[00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:32.840]   been updated in quite a while and they said no, the iPod touch is staying.
[00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:36.280]   This is mostly just take the air out of the lower end market.
[00:55:36.280 --> 00:55:39.880]   And Andy said it's exactly like the original iPod mini or iPod nano.
[00:55:39.880 --> 00:55:45.360]   >> iPad, iPod Magnum for the extra.
[00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:47.200]   >> Wait a minute.
[00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:51.400]   So you're saying -- forgive me, you're saying on the marketing side then they wouldn't put
[00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:53.440]   it in the touchline because I'm kind of with Andy on that.
[00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:56.520]   I mean Steve Jobs so famously hated, you know, stuff.
[00:55:56.520 --> 00:55:58.120]   And I know it's Tim Cook's company.
[00:55:58.120 --> 00:55:59.640]   I know it's not Steve Jobs anymore.
[00:55:59.640 --> 00:56:03.840]   But if you want to freak people out, make a 7-inch iPad that Steve Jobs said everybody
[00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:04.840]   would hate.
[00:56:04.840 --> 00:56:07.640]   On the other hand, I mean, I don't think anybody's really going to be fooled.
[00:56:07.640 --> 00:56:11.880]   A 7-inch iPod touch would be a 7-inch iPad in a lot of ways.
[00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:12.880]   >> That's what everyone else said.
[00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:14.960]   >> Everyone wants a video on an iPod.
[00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:16.800]   He said they're never going to make a phone.
[00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:19.320]   I mean, I don't think you can take what Steve Jobs says literally.
[00:56:19.320 --> 00:56:22.040]   It's more -- he's a marketing expert.
[00:56:22.040 --> 00:56:25.640]   He's giving you answers that are good for Apple.
[00:56:25.640 --> 00:56:26.640]   >> I don't know.
[00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:30.360]   >> I'm almost the link in the chat room because we went over the reasons, at least that we
[00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:32.280]   heard as to why they're doing it.
[00:56:32.280 --> 00:56:36.280]   Because I was not a believer, but after listening -- and we checked it a couple of times over
[00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:37.280]   it made sense.
[00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:43.880]   And so far, it's exactly like the other iPad just smaller, which does bring up issues about
[00:56:43.880 --> 00:56:46.760]   touch pockets and how apps are designed.
[00:56:46.760 --> 00:56:49.880]   But it solves a lot of the compatibility problems at the same time.
[00:56:49.880 --> 00:56:54.280]   >> You know, this is exactly the kind of thing that Apple would do.
[00:56:54.280 --> 00:56:59.320]   And all of the quibbles and all the things Steve said, everything would be immediately
[00:56:59.320 --> 00:57:00.320]   forgotten.
[00:57:00.320 --> 00:57:01.320]   And people go, "Oh, it's so cute."
[00:57:01.320 --> 00:57:03.720]   >> Oh, I got to have that.
[00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:07.120]   I bet you would sell to iPad owners.
[00:57:07.120 --> 00:57:08.120]   Seriously.
[00:57:08.120 --> 00:57:15.920]   >> If anybody in a coffee shop with an iPad and a mini iPad, I got to check their watch
[00:57:15.920 --> 00:57:17.960]   for the iPad and Nana watch.
[00:57:17.960 --> 00:57:22.880]   And I want to see what tattoos they have because that's -- that's -- that's -- I mean, it's
[00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:28.400]   one thing to say that I bought an iPad 3 and I still have my iPad, my first iPad and sometimes
[00:57:28.400 --> 00:57:29.400]   it's cool to have two screens.
[00:57:29.400 --> 00:57:31.280]   Okay, I do that all the time, too.
[00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:35.700]   But anybody who has original iPad who has a -- has a 7-incher, that's kind of an odd
[00:57:35.700 --> 00:57:36.700]   choice, I think.
[00:57:36.700 --> 00:57:37.700]   >> It's so cute, though.
[00:57:37.700 --> 00:57:40.120]   And you can keep in your pocket.
[00:57:40.120 --> 00:57:41.120]   >> And you can keep in your pocket.
[00:57:41.120 --> 00:57:42.600]   >> Finally an iPad for my dog.
[00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:43.600]   >> Yeah.
[00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:44.600]   >> No.
[00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:47.560]   >> If you walk into an airplane and you see people with iPads and a few people with kindles
[00:57:47.560 --> 00:57:50.000]   and smaller tablets, Apple wants their money, too.
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:51.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:55.120]   Well, there's not been a lot of evidence that anybody else is buying these things.
[00:57:55.120 --> 00:57:58.280]   A kindle -- the Kindle Fire is the only one that's selling and we don't know numbers,
[00:57:58.280 --> 00:58:03.560]   but it seems to be -- it's selling well, but -- and when you see people with -- with
[00:58:03.560 --> 00:58:07.800]   -- with e-book readers, I mean, you're absolutely right, you don't -- you see millions and millions
[00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:12.600]   of kindles out there, even the standard e-ink versions of them.
[00:58:12.600 --> 00:58:17.320]   So if you tell people that for just $100 more than this $99 Kindle touch, you can have an
[00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:19.920]   actual iPad that runs iOS software.
[00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:22.120]   A lot of people are going to find that extra hundred bucks.
[00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:23.120]   >> Mm.
[00:58:23.120 --> 00:58:24.120]   That's a very interesting -- >> That's a very interesting --
[00:58:24.120 --> 00:58:26.240]   >> -- tablet PC didn't sell before the iPad.
[00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:29.760]   I think the iPad money would redefine sales for lower-end tablets.
[00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:30.760]   >> Yeah.
[00:58:30.760 --> 00:58:33.200]   See, and that's why -- and this is just conjecture in my part.
[00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:34.200]   I acknowledge that.
[00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:39.240]   I just wonder if Apple would want to use the iPad brand on such a device.
[00:58:39.240 --> 00:58:44.920]   I think that if they were to make a seven-inch tablet, they would be very explicitly positioning
[00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:48.520]   it as an entertainment device, as a content device.
[00:58:48.520 --> 00:58:53.560]   And I think that commercials for the -- for a seven-inch iPad would be all about reading
[00:58:53.560 --> 00:59:00.480]   and all about games and all about little things and the seven-inch version of Flipboard.
[00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:02.240]   It wouldn't be about drawing things on it.
[00:59:02.240 --> 00:59:08.040]   It wouldn't be about editing keynote presentations.
[00:59:08.040 --> 00:59:12.720]   I just wonder -- and I put it more strongly than that -- I wonder if they wouldn't rather
[00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:16.000]   simply underscore that position by saying it's an iPod.
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:21.400]   It's the best iPod we've ever made because just as the realm of the iPad has grown, so
[00:59:21.400 --> 00:59:24.120]   has the screen of the iPod.
[00:59:24.120 --> 00:59:26.560]   >> Here's a really interesting report from a fortune.
[00:59:26.560 --> 00:59:29.440]   Thanks, Ron, in the chatroom for passing us away along.
[00:59:29.440 --> 00:59:35.440]   According to Philip Elmer DeWitt writing in Fortune Magazine, Apple's iPhone, he's no
[00:59:35.440 --> 00:59:39.160]   longer Verizon's best-selling phone.
[00:59:39.160 --> 00:59:41.840]   >> That's been already contradicted, though.
[00:59:41.840 --> 00:59:44.360]   They had another analyst come up for it and say, "No, no, no, wait.
[00:59:44.360 --> 00:59:46.200]   It's still the number one selling phone on Verizon."
[00:59:46.200 --> 00:59:48.800]   So it's a bit of an analyst fist-fight at the moment.
[00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:49.800]   [ Laughter ]
[00:59:49.800 --> 00:59:55.280]   >> Yeah, cana cords Michael Walkley told Apple Insider, "No, I don't believe it."
[00:59:55.280 --> 01:00:03.040]   However, Walkley based his comments and checks conducted in April and May and Duradla or
[01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:08.000]   Durad, Durad LA, covers June and that is what they're basing it on.
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:13.000]   >> Isn't it incredible that a phone from 2011 running CDMA might get outsold by a modern
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:16.200]   phone with LTE on America's best LTE network?
[01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:21.120]   >> The Droid Razor Max is their number one selling phone and then the Galaxy Nexus number
[01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:25.320]   three with the iPhone writes back down in the middle.
[01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:26.320]   >> That's advertising for you.
[01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:27.480]   And that kind of backs up.
[01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:35.360]   We were talking before the show about Microsoft and the potentially unhappy Microsoft phone
[01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:41.600]   buyers, particularly Lumia 900 buyers because they have a very, very, very nice phone that
[01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:44.720]   won't run the next version of Microsoft's phone OS.
[01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:47.080]   >> Yes, Microsoft announced last week.
[01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:50.280]   And the contention was by the panel, nobody knows, nobody cares.
[01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:53.080]   And I think this proves you're right.
[01:00:53.080 --> 01:01:00.080]   If people are buying the Droid Razor Max, no, is that sales within Verizon stores or sales
[01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:02.160]   overall?
[01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:05.320]   Because that's, I think, if that's true, then that's just the--
[01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:06.320]   >> Retail outlets.
[01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:07.320]   >> Okay.
[01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:09.440]   And I'll retail off those including Apple stores.
[01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:10.960]   >> Verizon retail outlets.
[01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:15.440]   >> Yeah, I see, I think that if you're coming into the Verizon store, you really aren't mind
[01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:18.000]   locked into any specific model phone.
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.000]   >> Good point.
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:22.400]   >> I think people who want an iPhone, their first impulse is not, I'm going to go to a
[01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:23.720]   specific carrier store.
[01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:26.960]   Their first impulse is, I'm going to the mall, I'm going to the Apple store.
[01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:28.280]   >> Good point.
[01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:33.400]   If it doesn't include Apple store sales, there's a big chunk missing, isn't it?
[01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:39.720]   >> That said, the latest figures that I've seen was something like 18 point lead, percentage
[01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:45.520]   point lead, adoption for usage of Android devices over iOS devices in the US.
[01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:52.680]   So it's not as though, it's not as though iOS and Android are, the iPhone and Android
[01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:56.600]   phones are kind of neck and neck and chasing you for the top spot.
[01:01:56.600 --> 01:02:02.680]   People are, for whatever reason, be it marketing, be it choice, be it features or whatever.
[01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:06.560]   People are buying more Android phones than are using more for Group phones than iOS.
[01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:08.520]   But yeah, I think that's interesting.
[01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:12.360]   >> That's interesting to tell the difference between what you buy at an Apple store versus
[01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:13.360]   a carrier store.
[01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:18.040]   >> Well, and also, as Andy and I have been talking in the Galaxy S3, which just came
[01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:21.760]   out and so isn't in those numbers yet, that's going to be a very challenging phone, especially
[01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:24.440]   since it's sold on all four carriers.
[01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:30.040]   It's thinner, bigger screen, better screen in some ways than the iPhone 4S.
[01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:33.360]   This is going to be a very compelling Android phone and I suspect that when you add this
[01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:36.600]   number and that's going to be a big number.
[01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:41.520]   >> It's going to be a challenging phone until this fall though, right?
[01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:42.520]   >> Well, we'll see.
[01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:44.520]   >> I mean, that's a good question.
[01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:46.760]   >> And I'm not, and don't misunderstand me, I'm not bashing the phone.
[01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:47.760]   I don't have one.
[01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:48.760]   You and Andy do.
[01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:50.280]   I'm not saying it's not a good phone.
[01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:54.120]   But when they release the next iPhone, I mean, what?
[01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:55.600]   >> Yes, I agree.
[01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:59.480]   >> I mean, it's, we're, as was just pointed out, we're in the middle of the cycle right
[01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:00.480]   now.
[01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:01.480]   We're sort of in the low.
[01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:02.480]   >> Right.
[01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:05.480]   And everybody knows, I think everybody's paying attention knows there's a new iPhone coming.
[01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:07.280]   >> And Android is competitive this year.
[01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:09.360]   I mean, the HTC One X is a fantastic phone.
[01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:10.360]   >> Beautiful phone.
[01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:12.000]   >> It's on a singular Android phone anymore.
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.000]   >> Yeah.
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:16.200]   All right, well, I'm going to tell you why I'm not buying the next iPhone in just a minute.
[01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:17.360]   We're going to take a break right now.
[01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:19.480]   Great panel with us.
[01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:23.800]   Andy Inaco from the Chicago Sun Times couldn't do this show without Andy.
[01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:25.880]   Alex Lindsey is on assignment.
[01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:28.360]   Where, you know, this is like where's Waldo?
[01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:29.640]   Where's Alex this time?
[01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:30.640]   >> London still.
[01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:31.640]   >> London still.
[01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:33.040]   He seems to have got stuck in London.
[01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:34.040]   >> Yeah.
[01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:38.320]   >> Also with us for the first time, I'm really glad to have him from iMore.com or an A-Ritchie
[01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:39.520]   editor in chief.
[01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:40.520]   Good to have you.
[01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:41.520]   >> To be here.
[01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:42.520]   >> And Ken Ray, of course.
[01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:43.520]   Mac OS Ken.
[01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:44.520]   Always.
[01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:46.920]   What a great, you know, this is a nice team.
[01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:47.920]   I like this panel.
[01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:48.920]   This is fun.
[01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:49.920]   We're having fun.
[01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:55.520]   And I'm very curious what you all have to say about the 19-pin connector.
[01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:57.640]   But first, a word from carbonite.
[01:03:57.640 --> 01:04:03.400]   I got to say whatever you carry, whatever you use, backup is everything.
[01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:07.800]   You know, nobody wants to think about losing a laptop.
[01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:12.520]   Nobody wants to think about a hard drive failing or fire or flood or theft or tsunami.
[01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:13.600]   But these things happen.
[01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:19.080]   And if your data is not protected, something much worse than losing the hardware can happen.
[01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:20.760]   You can lose your data.
[01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:22.680]   Think about what's on your hard drive.
[01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:28.040]   The pictures of your child being born, your wedding, your vacation, your financial records,
[01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:30.240]   your emails, there's so much stuff now.
[01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:31.600]   My life is on my hard drive.
[01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:32.640]   That's why I use carbonite.
[01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:38.000]   Make sure everything is backed up automatically, continuously, securely.
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.360]   You can even make it so private that even carbonite can't open.
[01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:43.960]   They have a complete, strong encryption system that only you have the keys.
[01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:46.520]   Of course, SSL whenever you're connected to the internet.
[01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:49.840]   And that's nice because it means carbonite's backing up whenever you're online, even at
[01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:54.920]   an insecure, high-fifi hotspot, carbonite's secure, carbonite's protected, and carbonite's
[01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:55.920]   backing up.
[01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:57.800]   When you make changes, they're backed up instantly.
[01:04:57.800 --> 01:04:59.040]   I want you to check it out.
[01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:00.440]   You can do it for free for two weeks.
[01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:01.440]   You don't need a credit card.
[01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:04.560]   You just need the offer code MACBRAKE.
[01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:09.600]   Carbonite.com, promo code MACBRAKE or offer code MACBRAKE.
[01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:15.600]   If you try it for two weeks and you like it, you could buy it for as little as $59 a year
[01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:18.360]   for each computer.
[01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:22.840]   All your personal data on a computer for $59, less than $5 a month, and we're going to give

[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.200]   and so forth for the PC users.
[01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:41.680]   That's carbonite.com.

[01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:50.040]   you buy.
[01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:51.560]   I am not going to buy.
[01:05:51.560 --> 01:05:53.200]   I'm going to say it now.
[01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:55.320]   You guys have to talk me off the ledge.
[01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:57.520]   Apple, I think we all agree now.
[01:05:57.520 --> 01:05:58.520]   We've seen the pictures.
[01:05:58.520 --> 01:06:00.320]   We've seen the prototypes.
[01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:03.560]   A new connector, no more 30-pin connector.
[01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:13.880]   A 19-pin mini connector, which will mean that I have $200 radio that the dock of the phone,
[01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:14.880]   30-pin dock.
[01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:16.720]   I have a Sonos dock.
[01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:19.560]   I have 830-pin cables.
[01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:21.760]   I have all of this stuff.
[01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:25.240]   I'll be a $30 adapter for you, Leo.
[01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:26.840]   Well, now this is an interesting question.
[01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:29.400]   The first thing I thought, "Oh, it's an easy thing to do."
[01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:34.760]   Apple just makes a little thing that snaps on the bottom that turns the 19-pin into 30-pin
[01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:36.960]   and adds maybe half an inch to the height.
[01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:38.040]   I thought, "Oh, that's easy."
[01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:39.040]   And guess what?
[01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:41.320]   I guarantee you, Apple won't do that.
[01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:43.520]   Oh, but someone will license the connector to the adapter.
[01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:44.520]   Somebody will do it.
[01:06:44.520 --> 01:06:45.520]   They'll be enough.
[01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:47.800]   I have to say I'm a little bit ambivalent here.
[01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:52.560]   Number one, Apple can't maintain the same connector forever just to make sure that your
[01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:55.280]   three-year-old car connector continues to work.
[01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:58.600]   But I can't get a new car because my phone connector changed.
[01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:01.400]   Oh, you got sweetheart deals with Ford.
[01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:02.800]   Oh, for goodness sake.
[01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:05.440]   You can have flex things and Apple colors in your running.
[01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:06.960]   Ford was smart enough not to put a...
[01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:10.960]   There are cars and headends that have 30-pin connectors, but Ford just has a USB port.
[01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:12.440]   So that's smart.
[01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:13.440]   Yeah.
[01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:19.200]   I mean, just last week, I finally did the work on my 10-year-old car, so I don't have
[01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:21.600]   to use a cassette adapter anymore.
[01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:25.360]   And I was in exactly the same position you were in where I do the next step, which is
[01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:26.920]   the hardware and a dock connector.
[01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:30.440]   But I knew that no, I shouldn't do that yet just until I find out.
[01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:36.840]   I mean, you can't expect Apple to always maintain compatibility with previous models.
[01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:44.800]   On the same note, though, Apple, if this is true, when they introduced this, they had
[01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:50.480]   damn well better make it clear that there's a productive, practical, functional reason
[01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:52.480]   why they made this change.
[01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:57.560]   Because if it's just a video of Johnny Ive making his explaining hands going, "And
[01:07:57.560 --> 01:08:01.600]   that way we have a smaller hole, nothing, nothing blemishes."
[01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:04.600]   You know he's going to say that.
[01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:10.840]   If it's a purely a design decision, Apple did a stupid, stupid thing.
[01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:13.480]   I believe I more actually broke this story back in February.
[01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:14.520]   I'll put the link here.
[01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:17.960]   And we checked into it a lot before we posted it because it was...
[01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:20.480]   Again, I did not believe it at the time.
[01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:22.160]   And we got a really good story back.
[01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:25.240]   The first part is that they are desperate for space and then you iPhone.
[01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:29.320]   It's the same reason they're looking at nano-sims and other space saving technologies.
[01:08:29.320 --> 01:08:31.640]   They need to cram an LTE radio in there.
[01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:36.160]   They need to cram a much bigger battery and they don't have the size of an iPad to do
[01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:37.160]   it in.
[01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:38.400]   So space is at a super premium.
[01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:41.400]   And at the same time, they're moving into wireless technology.
[01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:42.760]   They have AirPlay.
[01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:44.600]   They have Wi-Fi sync now.
[01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:49.080]   So they don't believe that the dock connector is as useful to as many people.
[01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:52.400]   And in a typical Apple move where they want to drive us kicking and screaming into the
[01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:59.560]   future, they believe that by doing this, we'll get to the Wi-Fi disconnected model faster.
[01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:03.880]   That points to another thing that would annoy me.
[01:09:03.880 --> 01:09:08.360]   This is the Galaxy S, the S3 versus the iPhone.
[01:09:08.360 --> 01:09:09.360]   And you know what?
[01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:10.360]   When I switch back to...
[01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:13.520]   I've been using this for almost an entire week just to get used to it and so I can write
[01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:14.520]   my review.
[01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:17.640]   And when I switch back to this, the iPhone looks small.
[01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:18.640]   It looks dinky.
[01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:19.880]   It looks inadequate.
[01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:22.800]   I like the extra room I have for touch typing.
[01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:25.240]   I like the extra room I have for reading things.
[01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:29.520]   Why would Apple be so absolutely violently opposed to making a phone that's a little
[01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:32.800]   bit larger just for the...
[01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:36.560]   If they're at the point where they have to redefine a dock connector just to have an
[01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:40.880]   extra little bit amount of space to put more chips in there, isn't that an indication
[01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:43.120]   that maybe you should consider...
[01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:47.360]   Maybe you should consider listening to millions and millions of users who have said...
[01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:48.360]   Who have had the option of...
[01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:53.760]   Who basically drove smaller Android handsets out of the market and switched to these instead.
[01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:55.600]   There are three prototypes, right?
[01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:57.840]   For the iPhone 5, now there's three prototypes.
[01:09:57.840 --> 01:10:01.320]   One is three by five inches, which is the same as the current size.
[01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:02.400]   Two of them are four inches.
[01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:04.760]   The one of the four inches is 16 by nine.
[01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:08.840]   So they don't want to make it wider because they want to maintain an easy one-handed use
[01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:09.840]   model.
[01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:12.080]   They want to be able to touch all areas of the screen with your thumb.
[01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:15.400]   If you're holding it in one size and because of the way the antennas built, there's not
[01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:16.880]   a lot of room sideways.
[01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:21.360]   So they're going to go up and it won't be much bigger and it will still require a lot
[01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:24.800]   of battery and a lot of LTE radio.
[01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:27.200]   It looks like they're not going to go any bigger than four inches.
[01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:28.720]   And Apple's a really agile company.
[01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:32.960]   It was the famous story of Steve Jobs changing the screen from plastic to glass in three
[01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:37.480]   weeks so they can decide up until July when they're going to go to.
[01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:40.720]   So one of the things that lends that story credibility is that these vary...
[01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:42.000]   I mean, they couldn't be faked.
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:45.640]   These videos of the case with a little 19-pin connector on it.
[01:10:45.640 --> 01:10:46.640]   But they're one of the prototypes.
[01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:47.640]   They're not.
[01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:48.640]   It's just...
[01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:49.640]   It hasn't chosen yet.
[01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:50.640]   Right.
[01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:51.640]   Exactly.
[01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:52.640]   So I just want to say...
[01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:54.680]   By the way, Dan Dierks has created a straw poll.
[01:10:54.680 --> 01:10:55.680]   Straw poll.me/694.
[01:10:55.680 --> 01:10:59.040]   We'll Leo buy the new iPhone.
[01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:00.360]   I'm 9% yes.
[01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:02.520]   I am not going to buy the new...
[01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:05.080]   Let's see.
[01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:06.720]   You could not cast your vote.
[01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:10.400]   I've already voted on the poll apparently.
[01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:11.400]   That was me.
[01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:12.400]   I voted.
[01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:13.400]   John voted.
[01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:14.400]   I used up our IP address.
[01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:15.400]   But you can click results to see.
[01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:16.400]   Let's see.
[01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:17.400]   Yeah.
[01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:18.400]   See, it's pretty...
[01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:19.400]   This is Chicago.
[01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:20.400]   You can only vote once.
[01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:21.400]   Yeah.
[01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:26.400]   Of course I'm going to buy the new iPhone, but I'm not going to be happy about it.
[01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:28.360]   You're going to buy it in protest?
[01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:29.560]   Well, I'm just saying...
[01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:33.280]   You know, a good example, this company called Renew, I reviewed the clock.
[01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:34.960]   It's a sleep clock.
[01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:38.240]   And it's nice you can put the iPad or the iPhone on the 30-pin connector.
[01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:39.520]   By the way, what about the iPad?
[01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:41.280]   Are they going to do that to the iPad next year too?
[01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:42.280]   Yeah.
[01:11:42.280 --> 01:11:46.320]   All future iOS products will have the micro-doc or mini-doc, whatever they call it.
[01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:51.880]   So this stupid clock that was $200 fortunately added by the Magic Doc.
[01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:52.880]   The Magic.
[01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:53.880]   Oh, yeah.
[01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:54.880]   It just works.
[01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:57.400]   You're welcome customers.
[01:11:57.400 --> 01:11:58.400]   We listen to you.
[01:11:58.400 --> 01:11:59.400]   Yeah.
[01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:01.880]   I don't know the last time I actually used the doc on my iPhone.
[01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:06.360]   I think when I have to install a beta from a developer who is not using test flight, I
[01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:07.360]   do it.
[01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:11.920]   And there's a beta, but after that, everything now is over the air or airplay or Wi-Fi sync.
[01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:13.680]   It's just very easy now.
[01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:14.680]   Yeah.
[01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:15.600]   The biggest drag to me is charging.
[01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:20.040]   I mean, I've had so many iPads and iPhones and iPads at this point.
[01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:23.880]   I haven't had as many as a lot of people I know, but I've had so many that I'm almost
[01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:27.000]   never without a way to charge.
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.840]   And yeah, that'll change with the next iPhone, I guess.
[01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:31.640]   I'll have one cord that I'll be able to do that with it.
[01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:32.640]   It comes with...
[01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:34.400]   I don't worry, I could buy more for $30.
[01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:37.080]   Does Apple sell an adapter?
[01:12:37.080 --> 01:12:40.480]   I guess they could make a small adapter that would snap on.
[01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:41.480]   Yeah.
[01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:46.120]   I am sure that someone's going to make sort of an iPhone case that in addition to giving
[01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:50.800]   you, you know, Titoro on the back of it also gives you transmogrifies the old style doc
[01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:53.360]   connector to the new style doc connector.
[01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:54.360]   It's a third party.
[01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:58.720]   Apple, Apple, once again, is good in that they're providing third party opportunities
[01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:03.960]   for other upstart startups to start making profits off of off of iPhone stuff.
[01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:04.960]   Right.
[01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:05.960]   I'm just...
[01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:06.960]   Exactly.
[01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:08.960]   You're getting your price.
[01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:10.480]   I should really try.
[01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:11.880]   I'm the opposite.
[01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:15.440]   I almost never Wi-Fi sync.
[01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:19.040]   The only time I do it is when I know that there's a fresh podcast where I know there's
[01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:21.960]   something brand new that I want to get, I'm away from my desktop.
[01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:26.440]   And the reason why I don't do that is because when I try doing Wi-Fi syncing for the first
[01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:29.520]   week and a half, so many inconsistencies popped up.
[01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:32.320]   So many times where I thought something was on there but wasn't.
[01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:35.880]   And I knew that if I actually take out the cable and actually connected, then that's
[01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:39.240]   the only way that I know that this data is going to be on there when I expect it to be.
[01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:40.720]   So maybe I should try it again.
[01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:45.720]   But it was the ultimate bad user experience where you stop using a feature because it
[01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:49.240]   failed to work the first three times that you expected it to work.
[01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:52.640]   It's a Hobson's choice because iTunes desktop will do that to you anyway.
[01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:53.640]   Yeah.
[01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:57.600]   Everything got so much more reliable once I turned off iCloud syncing and turned off
[01:13:57.600 --> 01:14:02.240]   iTunes match and simply said, let's do the same stupid way of copper pushing a
[01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:05.280]   electron from iTunes directly to the phone.
[01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:10.680]   Only then and only then was able to predict when a song or podcast would actually appear
[01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:13.120]   on the phone as I directed it to.
[01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:15.040]   I was the opposite and it's funny.
[01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:19.440]   On New Year's Day, I got hit by a firework, which is an odd story, but it hit mostly my
[01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:22.160]   phone and it turned the screen into like sandpaper.
[01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:23.760]   The phone saved your life, Renee.
[01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:25.000]   The phone saved.
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:26.000]   I could have been burning.
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:27.000]   I could still be burning.
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:28.680]   Holy cow.
[01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:31.840]   But it turned the screen into sandpaper and I went to the Apple store and I was ready
[01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:36.320]   to pay whatever the $200 is to replace it and they did it as a warranty exchange and
[01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:40.160]   they just gave me a stern lecture about taking better care of my Apple products.
[01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:42.000]   You got hit by a firework.
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.800]   I don't think you could have avoided that.
[01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:48.000]   I typed in my iCloud password and I left the store with my iPhone.
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:52.480]   It was a bit for bit identical to what I'd walked in off and that's a feature that none
[01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:54.440]   of their competitors are providing.
[01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:56.280]   That's what I went all in on iCloud.
[01:14:56.280 --> 01:14:58.920]   You can mostly do that with Android.
[01:14:58.920 --> 01:14:59.920]   They've had that for a while.
[01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:02.280]   There's no Google store to walk into to do it.
[01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:04.040]   Just to swap out the phone.
[01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:05.040]   That's absolutely true.
[01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:06.040]   That's absolutely true.
[01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:07.600]   No, it is one of the nice things about getting a new Android phone.
[01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:11.160]   You log into your Google account and all the apps even can't be onto it.
[01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:14.960]   It's kind of a nice feature.
[01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:18.680]   It won't be a thunderbolt 19-pin port.
[01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:19.680]   There's no reason to do that.
[01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:20.680]   It can't.
[01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:22.240]   It's not a PCI architecture.
[01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:23.240]   Okay.
[01:15:23.240 --> 01:15:24.240]   They can't.
[01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:26.240]   The hardware doesn't support it.
[01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:28.720]   I'm sure they're going to do this.
[01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:30.320]   We had Ryan Block on Twitter on Sunday.
[01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:33.160]   It was a good Twitter, by the way, if you didn't hear it.
[01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:37.520]   We had Padre, SJ, Father, Robert Balaser, and Larry Magadan.
[01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:40.120]   Ryan, you know, Ryan's with Gadget.
[01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:41.280]   He said, "No, it's time."
[01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:42.440]   He says, "That 30-pin connector.
[01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:43.440]   What is it?
[01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:44.440]   10 years old?
[01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:45.440]   It's time.
[01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:46.440]   You got to...
[01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:47.440]   It's too big.
[01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:48.440]   It wastes space.
[01:15:48.440 --> 01:15:49.440]   You got to update it.
[01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:50.440]   You just got to bite the bullet.
[01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:52.760]   If your Apple's good at this, they just bite the bullet and they make the change.
[01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:57.920]   When Apple fanboys like me go, "Yes, master.
[01:15:57.920 --> 01:15:59.920]   Whatever you say, master.
[01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:00.920]   What is thy will?
[01:16:00.920 --> 01:16:03.080]   I'll buy it."
[01:16:03.080 --> 01:16:07.040]   I'm already in line today for the new mini connector.
[01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:11.000]   First one with the unboxing video on the mini that you'll see to dock connector.
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:12.000]   You know I'll buy it.
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:13.000]   Actually, it's going to be...
[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:14.640]   There's one on the universe 1,500 bucks.
[01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:18.280]   If it weren't for the Galaxy S3, it would be a no-brainer.
[01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:23.240]   But at this point, I've been carrying the Galaxy instead of the iPhone.
[01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:28.200]   I'm not right up there with you yet.
[01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:36.360]   I will say that if Apple ever did something with the iPhone that steamed me sufficiently,
[01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:40.640]   part of my decision on whether to upgrade to the next iPhone or not would be affected
[01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:44.720]   by the fact that I know that there are plenty of Android handsets out there that will make
[01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:45.720]   me just as happy.
[01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:46.720]   Exactly.
[01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:49.600]   And that's why Apple has to be a little more careful than in the past.
[01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:54.080]   Now, here's something I think will make part of the decision for me.
[01:16:54.080 --> 01:16:56.480]   Maybe Renee, you know this.
[01:16:56.480 --> 01:16:59.480]   Will there be NFC in the new iPhone?
[01:16:59.480 --> 01:17:01.000]   I have heard there might be NFC.
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.520]   I haven't seen any real solid information on it.
[01:17:03.520 --> 01:17:08.840]   But if you look at what Apple did at WWDC, especially with a past book, past book is
[01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:13.520]   one of those wonderful abstracted APIs that right now has the QR codes but could very
[01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:17.080]   easily be swapped in for RFID, NFC.
[01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:20.800]   And Apple, I think one of the large reasons for the App Store success was the iTunes cash
[01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:24.760]   register because they could take credit cards in so many countries around the world.
[01:17:24.760 --> 01:17:27.920]   Plugging those things together seems like an obvious move for Apple.
[01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:28.920]   I like NFC.
[01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:31.640]   I've got NFC in some of my Android phones.
[01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:36.880]   We even have Samsung sells these for their expensive three bucks a pop.
[01:17:36.880 --> 01:17:39.360]   Little NFC stickers, we have one in the door when you walk in.
[01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:45.240]   And as you walk in, I can tap my phone on the sticker and it checks me in on four square.
[01:17:45.240 --> 01:17:48.640]   And I can see the real value of NFC is pretty apparent.
[01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:53.240]   But I don't think it can succeed if you don't get Apple along for the ride, right?
[01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:54.240]   Yeah.
[01:17:54.240 --> 01:17:59.240]   I mean, someone's trying to figure out a way to make it actually integrate into people's
[01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:00.240]   lives.
[01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:06.080]   I happen to have had lunch a few days ago with someone else who had an S3.
[01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:11.840]   And so this was our first opportunity to actually try these features that used NFC chips to
[01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:14.160]   directly send a URL from a web page.
[01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:17.640]   So if I'm telling you, hey, there's a really good web page tap and it hits on the other
[01:18:17.640 --> 01:18:18.640]   guy's phone.
[01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:25.280]   It took us about five minutes of looking like such a door to holding our 100-way power
[01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:26.280]   phones to try.
[01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:28.080]   Okay, is it working now?
[01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:29.080]   No way.
[01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:30.080]   It's telling me to say, okay, wait, hang on.
[01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:32.080]   Wait, okay, don't let go yet.
[01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:33.080]   Don't let go yet.
[01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:38.240]   If a company does it as simply as just simply tap, oh, I've held this on a buffer.
[01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:39.400]   Do you really want to accept it or not?
[01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:40.400]   Great.
[01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:41.960]   Do you want to accept everything from this guy from, yep, great.
[01:18:41.960 --> 01:18:45.000]   If it works that easily, it'll be great.
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:49.040]   Otherwise, they're competing with the idea of just a share button that says email.
[01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:52.160]   Everybody knows what to do with the URL when it hits into an inbox.
[01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:55.600]   Everybody knows what to do with a photo when it hits into into a box.
[01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:59.760]   Once you say it's simple to connect, boom, but then you have to take seven steps to decide,
[01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:01.880]   okay, do you want to share this five-piece?
[01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:04.200]   Asa, do you want to share this via iCloud?
[01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:06.400]   Yeah, it's early, though.
[01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:13.600]   When I can walk in, I use Square Cardcase, I guess they call it Pay with Square now.
[01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:14.600]   There's a coffee shop down.
[01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:16.400]   There's only very few people do it.
[01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:21.320]   But when they do it, it's so cool because I walk into the coffee shop.
[01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:29.160]   If stores that I use, like Chipotle used Apple Store payment system as a former payment,
[01:19:29.160 --> 01:19:33.640]   I would be using that all the time, not only because it's so, I feel so much more secure
[01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:37.280]   than handing over my plastic, but also because I know that they would do it in such a way
[01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:41.520]   that I would, well, maybe the downside is that I would get a monthly chart of, here's
[01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:44.680]   how much you spent on Peritos last month.
[01:19:44.680 --> 01:19:48.080]   Here's the calorie count of all the Peritos you ate over the past three and a half weeks.
[01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:49.080]   Well, that's what Square does.
[01:19:49.080 --> 01:19:50.640]   I mean, in emails you had a map.
[01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:51.640]   This is where you bought it.
[01:19:51.640 --> 01:19:52.640]   This is what you paid for.
[01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:55.960]   You have a button to tip the guy, although it's a little annoying because the smallest
[01:19:55.960 --> 01:19:57.480]   tip is a buck.
[01:19:57.480 --> 01:20:00.440]   But I guess that's maybe making it.
[01:20:00.440 --> 01:20:03.800]   It can be done so well, especially if you were able to integrate it with Mint and other
[01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:09.320]   like online banking systems where every purchase that you make automatically goes in
[01:20:09.320 --> 01:20:13.840]   and is categorized because you already said, "Oh, Starbucks is entertainment," or an option
[01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:16.560]   button for this is a, yeah, I would be all over that.
[01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:21.800]   But only I would not be one of the first 10,000 people to be all over that because the first
[01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:25.320]   50,000 criminals would be the first ones to be all over that.
[01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:28.600]   And then that's when I would jump in after I realized that, okay, it's kind of safe.
[01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:29.600]   Just don't lose your phone.
[01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:30.600]   Apple's very good at that.
[01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:31.600]   I mean, they don't give you multitasking.
[01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:34.840]   They give you Pandora and Tom and Skype and they won't give us NFC.
[01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:37.160]   They'll give us Starbucks or Chipotle.
[01:20:37.160 --> 01:20:42.480]   But the only question for me is, will it be like FaceTime or Siri where Apple introduces
[01:20:42.480 --> 01:20:47.600]   this George Jetson technology we've been waiting for and it takes the market a long time to
[01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:50.600]   actually make it a mainstream product?
[01:20:50.600 --> 01:20:52.960]   Well, if anybody could push it over the top, it's Apple.
[01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:54.880]   That's why I'd love to see it in the new iPhone.
[01:20:54.880 --> 01:20:59.920]   I think that then you have, you know, this, you've got an installed base, a massive installed
[01:20:59.920 --> 01:21:00.920]   base.
[01:21:00.920 --> 01:21:03.280]   You've got somebody really working on making it easy to use.
[01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:07.240]   I think merchants jump in the bandwagon then and I think it's snowballs.
[01:21:07.240 --> 01:21:10.640]   And I think if Apple doesn't do it, it probably is stillborn.
[01:21:10.640 --> 01:21:11.880]   I think it just stops.
[01:21:11.880 --> 01:21:15.160]   And so it really is, it's Apple's market to make at this point.
[01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:16.800]   Well, I think that, I think that you're right.
[01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:18.040]   I think that's exactly how they would do it.
[01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:21.800]   They wouldn't do it as the, they're not, they wouldn't do it to compete with MasterCard
[01:21:21.800 --> 01:21:22.800]   or Visa.
[01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:26.640]   They would do it by saying, now, now you're your Apple, your Apple ID works in Starbucks.
[01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:29.960]   Now your Apple ID works in a, you're a past hood.
[01:21:29.960 --> 01:21:32.040]   What's up, your coupon when you walk in the store.
[01:21:32.040 --> 01:21:33.040]   Right.
[01:21:33.040 --> 01:21:34.040]   Right.
[01:21:34.040 --> 01:21:36.960]   And then the big deal would be the first time they say, and now your password works in
[01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:39.600]   JCPenney and that works in Target.
[01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:43.240]   JCPenney would probably, obviously, be the first one to go because they have an in there
[01:21:43.240 --> 01:21:44.240]   at the company.
[01:21:44.240 --> 01:21:46.040]   But the first time that it would be.
[01:21:46.040 --> 01:21:47.040]   Yeah.
[01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:50.840]   I, I think this is very, very interesting.
[01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:54.760]   And I hope Apple does support it because I think it will change everything.
[01:21:54.760 --> 01:21:55.760]   And you won't be carrying a wall.
[01:21:55.760 --> 01:21:58.200]   I mean, that's why they did the past, what is it?
[01:21:58.200 --> 01:21:59.200]   Past book.
[01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:00.200]   That's why they did it, right?
[01:22:00.200 --> 01:22:01.200]   Yeah.
[01:22:01.200 --> 01:22:04.520]   And you have a whole API stack, past kit behind it.
[01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:06.720]   And it looks really like a typical Apple thing.
[01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:09.040]   It's really well abstracted and thought out.
[01:22:09.040 --> 01:22:14.040]   And I think it's, they'll have partners at first, like same way they announced at WWDC.
[01:22:14.040 --> 01:22:15.520]   And then it'll roll out from there.
[01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:19.720]   And if they do folks buy Apple stock, because that's a license to make money.
[01:22:19.720 --> 01:22:22.240]   I mean, that's just, if you take one million dollars, it's billions.
[01:22:22.240 --> 01:22:23.240]   It's instant.
[01:22:23.240 --> 01:22:24.240]   Yeah.
[01:22:24.240 --> 01:22:27.440]   Maybe we'll get 30% off of every burrito that I buy.
[01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:29.600]   They'll try if they thought they could get away with it.
[01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:30.600]   They would.
[01:22:30.600 --> 01:22:33.360]   Hey, we're giving you 70% Chipotle.
[01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:35.720]   We're rolling in burrito books.
[01:22:35.720 --> 01:22:38.680]   We're bringing you in new business and new awareness.
[01:22:38.680 --> 01:22:41.680]   All you have to do is make sure that everyone of your burritos is put not in one of those
[01:22:41.680 --> 01:22:44.240]   red plastic baskets, but inside a box of sand.
[01:22:44.240 --> 01:22:47.560]   We want to improve the experience for your users.
[01:22:47.560 --> 01:22:50.560]   All we ask is that you stay out of our way.
[01:22:50.560 --> 01:22:51.560]   Yes.
[01:22:51.560 --> 01:22:54.200]   Last story that we're going to get to our picks of the week.
[01:22:54.200 --> 01:23:04.800]   Judge Posner with prejudice throws out Apple's lawsuit against Motorola with prejudice.
[01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:09.280]   Is it Judge Posner or is it Apple that is in the wrong?
[01:23:09.280 --> 01:23:13.920]   Fospatent's Florian Mueller says, "Apple's riff off claims are right."
[01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:16.640]   Judge Posner's decision doesn't prove there was no ripoff.
[01:23:16.640 --> 01:23:21.440]   He just can't see that the patents were shown to him and the related infringement allegations
[01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:25.880]   and damages substantiated a ripoff of the illegal kind.
[01:23:25.880 --> 01:23:31.040]   So is it Posner's mistake?
[01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:34.480]   It's, I mean, they just, Apple didn't show, Apple's lawyers did not present compelling
[01:23:34.480 --> 01:23:35.480]   damages at the judge.
[01:23:35.480 --> 01:23:36.480]   That's a bad job.
[01:23:36.480 --> 01:23:37.480]   Okay.
[01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:38.480]   Yeah.
[01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:40.840]   Or the patents just weren't good enough to have compelling damages.
[01:23:40.840 --> 01:23:44.240]   I mean, you can legally rip somebody off, illegally rip somebody off.
[01:23:44.240 --> 01:23:45.240]   Right.
[01:23:45.240 --> 01:23:46.400]   Apple didn't prove that it was an illegal ripoff.
[01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:48.400]   But there is no appeal.
[01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:54.480]   Posner's, well, although Mueller says there is 100% certainty of appealing appeal, I thought
[01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:57.840]   because he ruled with prejudice, there wasn't going to be an appeal.
[01:23:57.840 --> 01:23:59.440]   No, they can appeal to a higher court.
[01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:01.520]   They can't come back to his court.
[01:24:01.520 --> 01:24:02.520]   He's court.
[01:24:02.520 --> 01:24:03.520]   Got it.
[01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:04.520]   Yeah.
[01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:07.000]   I think his quote was something like, "It would be stupid of me to throw this case out
[01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:10.200]   and give you guys a chance to come back and argue the same argument again."
[01:24:10.200 --> 01:24:11.200]   Right.
[01:24:11.200 --> 01:24:13.240]   So yeah, you take it somewhere else.
[01:24:13.240 --> 01:24:14.480]   It's not selling here.
[01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:15.480]   Interesting.
[01:24:15.480 --> 01:24:19.920]   I got the feeling he was just sick of it, which, you know, I kind of, I really enjoyed
[01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:23.920]   reading how he's been writing about it lately or how he's been talking about it lately.
[01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:24.920]   Thank you.
[01:24:24.920 --> 01:24:26.680]   Well, and a funny kind of way.
[01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:30.200]   And really, Leo, aren't we all cranky with the IP lawsuit at this point?
[01:24:30.200 --> 01:24:31.200]   Yes.
[01:24:31.200 --> 01:24:35.080]   I mean, I know they're probably maybe necessary or something.
[01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:36.080]   I don't know.
[01:24:36.080 --> 01:24:37.080]   I'm tired of them.
[01:24:37.080 --> 01:24:38.080]   Yep.
[01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:43.200]   So, you know, if I had a hammer, sure I'd hammer in the morning, but if I had a hammer and
[01:24:43.200 --> 01:24:47.840]   a robe, you know, I'd probably do the same thing just because, come on, especially with
[01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:49.520]   this one because he's right.
[01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:52.280]   Who can prove damage is exactly right in this case?
[01:24:52.280 --> 01:24:54.240]   I love what he said to Motorola.
[01:24:54.240 --> 01:24:57.680]   Motorola was trying to block Apple from, aren't they?
[01:24:57.680 --> 01:24:59.480]   And this is actually still going before the ITC.
[01:24:59.480 --> 01:25:04.800]   They're trying to block import of the iPad and the iPhone because Apple is using patents
[01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:06.400]   that are standards essential.
[01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:07.400]   Oh.
[01:25:07.400 --> 01:25:08.400]   They have to.
[01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:11.360]   I mean, they have to use them if they're going to make the phones and Motorola is trying
[01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:13.920]   to stop them from using them.
[01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:19.920]   And the judge, Posner, Posner, Mr. Richard, let's say, I was like, come on, guys, you
[01:25:19.920 --> 01:25:20.920]   can't do that.
[01:25:20.920 --> 01:25:21.920]   And you know you can't do that.
[01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:23.320]   This is why I'm sick of the law, do you?
[01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:25.320]   Get out, get out, get out, get out.
[01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:26.320]   Got off my lawn.
[01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:27.320]   Get off my lawn.
[01:25:27.320 --> 01:25:29.720]   Get out of my court.
[01:25:29.720 --> 01:25:32.400]   That's why being a judge is a good job.
[01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:35.120]   But they have to work so hard in the stress.
[01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:36.680]   I just think they're underpaid.
[01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:38.800]   I think they're like Apple store employees.
[01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:45.520]   Like just like Apple store next Sunday and an all new New York time.
[01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:50.520]   Federal judges, poor underpaid, overworked federal judges.
[01:25:50.520 --> 01:25:55.400]   We're going to take a break at our iOS tip or lion tip or tips or picks and all that
[01:25:55.400 --> 01:25:56.400]   stuff.
[01:25:56.400 --> 01:25:57.400]   I don't know.
[01:25:57.400 --> 01:26:03.360]   You can in Renee that you've got to pony up at this point.
[01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:04.920]   So get ready.
[01:26:04.920 --> 01:26:07.160]   Just pick something, anything.
[01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:10.800]   Don't worry about it if we've done it before because nobody listens to every show.
[01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:14.160]   So anything's new if it's new to you.
[01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:19.000]   But first is a word from our friends at Ford Motor Company.
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:20.000]   I heard a sentence.
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.280]   I was at a Ford event last week and I heard a sentence.
[01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:25.520]   I think it was from Ford's CTO or might have been from Prasad, the guy opening the Silicon
[01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:26.680]   Valley Bureau there.
[01:26:26.680 --> 01:26:28.400]   Just made something click.
[01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:29.920]   They said the car is a platform.
[01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:35.160]   We see the car as a platform like iOS is a platform like Windows is a platform.
[01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:38.680]   Something we give you the tools, we give you the basics, we give you the sensors, we give
[01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:45.240]   you the platform and then they want developers to develop for the platform.
[01:26:45.240 --> 01:26:47.680]   And I think I was so inspired by that.
[01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:50.480]   It's such a great way to think about what they're up to.
[01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:52.160]   They said we don't know.
[01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:53.160]   Car is adorable.
[01:26:53.160 --> 01:26:54.160]   Good.
[01:26:54.160 --> 01:26:55.160]   You're going to have it for years.
[01:26:55.160 --> 01:26:56.560]   We don't know how you want to use it in a few years.
[01:26:56.560 --> 01:26:59.480]   So what we do, and we don't know how we want to use it even.
[01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:05.800]   So what we do is we build in capabilities and then give you an API, they call it AppLink,
[01:27:05.800 --> 01:27:09.280]   that lets you, the developer, write stuff for it.
[01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:10.280]   I think this is just great.
[01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:16.360]   If you go to Ford.com/technology, you can see what Ford is up to with their technology
[01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:17.360]   platform.
[01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:18.360]   This is another thing.
[01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:22.680]   I mean, here's a car company that has a page about their technology.
[01:27:22.680 --> 01:27:24.720]   And page, there's pages.
[01:27:24.720 --> 01:27:25.880]   There's so much to talk about.
[01:27:25.880 --> 01:27:30.360]   Take a look at the MyFord mobile app, for instance, for their electric vehicles.
[01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:34.120]   This 20, this fantastic 2012 Ford Focus.
[01:27:34.120 --> 01:27:35.120]   Here's the deal.
[01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:38.440]   So you go to your EV Certified Ford dealer, bring your phone because you could put the
[01:27:38.440 --> 01:27:39.920]   app on there.
[01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:43.920]   And then it tells you things like this, as you're driving, the state of charge, when
[01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:49.160]   you've got it in the garage, the app will tell you how far charged the battery is.
[01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:53.320]   You can even press a button, say, only charge at the lowest possible prices.
[01:27:53.320 --> 01:27:58.880]   And the phone talks to the utility company and finds out what the best charging times
[01:27:58.880 --> 01:28:03.580]   are and sets the charging time for that time to save you money.
[01:28:03.580 --> 01:28:11.880]   You can use the phone to find charging stations as you drive around to tell you the most eco-friendly
[01:28:11.880 --> 01:28:14.640]   route, the route that will save you money.
[01:28:14.640 --> 01:28:15.640]   Look how beautiful this is.
[01:28:15.640 --> 01:28:20.520]   Now, by the way, this is so cool because this is a virtual screen, right?
[01:28:20.520 --> 01:28:21.520]   I don't know.
[01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:27.120]   It would be physical, but these are all virtual and programmable and they can change.
[01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:28.920]   Just really sweet stuff.
[01:28:28.920 --> 01:28:31.040]   This is a state of the art.
[01:28:31.040 --> 01:28:37.280]   Yeah, the 4.2 inch LCD instrument cluster screens on either side of the speedometer in
[01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:43.120]   the 2012 Ford Focus that tell you everything you need to know.
[01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:46.360]   And they even have some little gamification.
[01:28:46.360 --> 01:28:51.360]   They have a more MyFord Mobile website where you can see how much CO2 you've saved by
[01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:53.760]   driving your 2012 Ford Focus Electric.
[01:28:53.760 --> 01:28:55.960]   And then who's the leader?
[01:28:55.960 --> 01:28:57.440]   They have leaderboards.
[01:28:57.440 --> 01:28:58.920]   I love this.
[01:28:58.920 --> 01:29:04.320]   Encouraging us to save money and drive more efficiently.
[01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:10.080]   My Ford Mobile app is available on Android Blackberry and of course iPhone and is just
[01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:14.720]   one of many ways Ford is making a state of the art statement and technology.
[01:29:14.720 --> 01:29:16.640]   They just opened their Silicon Valley Bureau.
[01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:18.280]   They're reaching out to developers.
[01:29:18.280 --> 01:29:19.560]   It is a platform.
[01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:22.800]   It's just exactly the way to look at it.
[01:29:22.800 --> 01:29:25.480]   You'll never think of cars the same way again.
[01:29:25.480 --> 01:29:30.760]   And next year the 2013 Ford Fusion Energy Plug-in Hybrid.
[01:29:30.760 --> 01:29:33.560]   I tell you.
[01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:35.560]   All right.
[01:29:35.560 --> 01:29:39.680]   Thank you, Ford, for your support, by the way, of all of our shows here at Twin.
[01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:44.560]   And let me just say thank you, Apple, as I've been looking at this iPod or a podcasting
[01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:45.560]   app.
[01:29:45.560 --> 01:29:48.520]   This is going to be huge for podcasts.
[01:29:48.520 --> 01:29:53.400]   I think we'll see an immediate bump in download numbers just because we are featured.
[01:29:53.400 --> 01:29:59.240]   And by the way, folks, do me a favor if you like our shows.
[01:29:59.240 --> 01:30:03.480]   Subscribe in the podcasting app.
[01:30:03.480 --> 01:30:08.360]   And kind of support us because I think that there's the leader.
[01:30:08.360 --> 01:30:11.280]   One of the things we suffer from a little bit is older podcasts.
[01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:17.160]   We don't get into the top lists because of the catalog because these are based on who's
[01:30:17.160 --> 01:30:18.880]   been subscribing the most recently.
[01:30:18.880 --> 01:30:20.520]   And I think most of you are subscribing.
[01:30:20.520 --> 01:30:21.520]   And some based on...
[01:30:21.520 --> 01:30:22.520]   Yeah.
[01:30:22.520 --> 01:30:24.000]   It's like a billboard, a magazine.
[01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:25.800]   These are the charts.
[01:30:25.800 --> 01:30:27.400]   So I'd like to get on the charts.
[01:30:27.400 --> 01:30:30.920]   So if you're downloading the app, subscribe.
[01:30:30.920 --> 01:30:33.680]   And somebody said, "Oh, Leo's not going to like this.
[01:30:33.680 --> 01:30:35.760]   It's got a 30 second skip in it."
[01:30:35.760 --> 01:30:36.760]   Well, that's fine.
[01:30:36.760 --> 01:30:37.920]   What am I going to do?
[01:30:37.920 --> 01:30:41.360]   There's also going to 10 second rewind.
[01:30:41.360 --> 01:30:43.000]   And I love the...
[01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.400]   I guess it is the Sumorphism of the tape, really.
[01:30:45.400 --> 01:30:46.880]   I just love that.
[01:30:46.880 --> 01:30:49.080]   I downloaded the iPhone version of it during the show.
[01:30:49.080 --> 01:30:50.640]   I was really pleased.
[01:30:50.640 --> 01:30:55.920]   As soon as you launched it for the first time, it imports all of your existing podcasts,
[01:30:55.920 --> 01:30:58.680]   podcast subscriptions from the Music Player app.
[01:30:58.680 --> 01:31:03.600]   So it was like, "Oh, somebody that was the part that I was saying."
[01:31:03.600 --> 01:31:06.960]   That was the part that I was saying looked kind of metro at first glance.
[01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:07.960]   Right, yeah.
[01:31:07.960 --> 01:31:09.200]   It looked like the tiles at first glance.
[01:31:09.200 --> 01:31:11.640]   But yeah, that really is neat because...
[01:31:11.640 --> 01:31:17.920]   Look, there, PUD has to sort of stop listening to just because I haven't been syncing with
[01:31:17.920 --> 01:31:18.920]   my computers.
[01:31:18.920 --> 01:31:19.920]   Right.
[01:31:19.920 --> 01:31:20.920]   So when I think about it, I'll go and download another one.
[01:31:20.920 --> 01:31:24.640]   But now the bugle, audio newspaper for a visual version.
[01:31:24.640 --> 01:31:25.640]   Love that.
[01:31:25.640 --> 01:31:26.640]   Love that.
[01:31:26.640 --> 01:31:30.440]   I'm now subscribed to it on my phone, which means my bugle listening will go back up exponentially.
[01:31:30.440 --> 01:31:32.240]   Yeah, I think that should help us.
[01:31:32.240 --> 01:31:33.240]   It's going to be fantastic.
[01:31:33.240 --> 01:31:34.240]   It's going to be fantastic.
[01:31:34.240 --> 01:31:36.040]   On an iPad, all the videos will be fantastic.
[01:31:36.040 --> 01:31:37.600]   Yeah, get all our videos on the...
[01:31:37.600 --> 01:31:38.600]   That's what you do.
[01:31:38.600 --> 01:31:40.600]   Get all the videos on the iPads.
[01:31:40.600 --> 01:31:42.640]   Subscribe to the audio on your iPhone.
[01:31:42.640 --> 01:31:43.640]   That's all I ask.
[01:31:43.640 --> 01:31:44.640]   That's the both worlds.
[01:31:44.640 --> 01:31:46.680]   For each and every show that we do.
[01:31:46.680 --> 01:31:49.360]   And make sure you listen and watch each and every one.
[01:31:49.360 --> 01:31:50.360]   Thank you.
[01:31:50.360 --> 01:31:51.360]   And leave them all ratings.
[01:31:51.360 --> 01:31:52.360]   Bye, sorry.
[01:31:52.360 --> 01:31:53.360]   Go on, Michael.
[01:31:53.360 --> 01:31:54.360]   No, I think this is good.
[01:31:54.360 --> 01:31:56.600]   Can I second that for this other show that I...
[01:31:56.600 --> 01:31:57.600]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:31:57.600 --> 01:31:58.600]   MacoEsken.com.
[01:31:58.600 --> 01:31:59.600]   Yeah, subscribe.
[01:31:59.600 --> 01:32:00.600]   Listen.
[01:32:00.600 --> 01:32:01.600]   Yeah.
[01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:03.600]   No, I think can you agree?
[01:32:03.600 --> 01:32:05.960]   This is a huge step forward for podcasting.
[01:32:05.960 --> 01:32:06.960]   Yeah, it's very...
[01:32:06.960 --> 01:32:08.320]   I mean, it's very exciting.
[01:32:08.320 --> 01:32:10.480]   I mean, seriously, when was the last time?
[01:32:10.480 --> 01:32:14.320]   The last time I remember there being big attention on podcasting as a whole was when
[01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:19.560]   CBS launched KYOU Radio in San Francisco.
[01:32:19.560 --> 01:32:20.560]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:32:20.560 --> 01:32:21.560]   You ever remember that?
[01:32:21.560 --> 01:32:22.560]   Yeah.
[01:32:22.560 --> 01:32:23.560]   Quietly killed about a year ago, I think.
[01:32:23.560 --> 01:32:26.600]   Well, no, they killed it as a broadcast thing like two or three years ago.
[01:32:26.600 --> 01:32:28.960]   They finally killed their web stream about a year ago.
[01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:31.880]   It was all podcast radio.
[01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:32.880]   Yeah.
[01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:36.880]   And I'm sure you guys know this, but iTunes, we have 10 shows on iTunes now and the iTunes
[01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:37.880]   team is fantastic.
[01:32:37.880 --> 01:32:38.880]   They are.
[01:32:38.880 --> 01:32:42.320]   They do everything I can to feature you, to get artist pages set up, to get special event
[01:32:42.320 --> 01:32:43.400]   pages set up.
[01:32:43.400 --> 01:32:44.600]   They're doing a lot to help us.
[01:32:44.600 --> 01:32:47.920]   No, they reach out to us all the time and we have a great relationship.
[01:32:47.920 --> 01:32:50.600]   They're really nice guys and they do agree with you 100%.
[01:32:50.600 --> 01:32:54.160]   And I don't want to sound like I've been complaining about how they've been because
[01:32:54.160 --> 01:32:57.160]   I've been lucky enough to be featured a few times as well.
[01:32:57.160 --> 01:33:00.080]   And they've been really great with what they've had.
[01:33:00.080 --> 01:33:01.560]   It is neat to see something new.
[01:33:01.560 --> 01:33:06.000]   It's neat to see something that is going to draw more attention to podcasts because,
[01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:09.960]   I mean, for the people who are already podcasters and for the people who are already into podcasting,
[01:33:09.960 --> 01:33:13.120]   it's been a good place to go.
[01:33:13.120 --> 01:33:17.240]   But now, this is the first thing that's going to kick a bunch of people in that direction,
[01:33:17.240 --> 01:33:21.320]   which is kind of funny because, I mean, what it's going towards is actually making it less
[01:33:21.320 --> 01:33:26.120]   accessible in some ways automatically because from all the reports, it's coming out of iOS
[01:33:26.120 --> 01:33:27.120]   6.
[01:33:27.120 --> 01:33:29.040]   It's for, I mean, iTunes and iOS 6.
[01:33:29.040 --> 01:33:33.000]   So it's not going to be available for everyone automatically the way it is now and yet it's
[01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:36.800]   going to be more prevalent, at least over the next month or so, as people get hit to
[01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:38.800]   the fact that Apple's got a new app out there for it.
[01:33:38.800 --> 01:33:41.160]   Well, we're going to push it like crazy.
[01:33:41.160 --> 01:33:42.920]   I will also push it like crazy.
[01:33:42.920 --> 01:33:45.360]   Hopefully we'll get a nice big iBook style.
[01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:46.360]   Please download this now.
[01:33:46.360 --> 01:33:47.360]   Pop up in some.
[01:33:47.360 --> 01:33:48.360]   Wouldn't that be nice?
[01:33:48.360 --> 01:33:51.920]   Anyway, let's get our picks of the week starting with Andy.
[01:33:51.920 --> 01:33:53.240]   That'll be our iOS tip.
[01:33:53.240 --> 01:33:55.240]   Get the podcast app.
[01:33:55.240 --> 01:33:57.880]   Unless Andy, you have one you'd like to do a lion tip.
[01:33:57.880 --> 01:33:59.440]   You'd like to do our OS 10 tip.
[01:33:59.440 --> 01:34:00.440]   You can give us our.
[01:34:00.440 --> 01:34:01.840]   No, I have a lot.
[01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:05.200]   I had a lion tip last week we didn't do and also one of those.
[01:34:05.200 --> 01:34:06.200]   Well, let's do it.
[01:34:06.200 --> 01:34:07.200]   Let's do it.
[01:34:07.200 --> 01:34:09.400]   Well, it's good to have one on deck for like I'm ready for next week.
[01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:10.920]   Well, do you want to do one now?
[01:34:10.920 --> 01:34:11.920]   Okay, I'll do.
[01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:13.200]   Okay, I'll do a simple one now then.
[01:34:13.200 --> 01:34:14.200]   I got one too.
[01:34:14.200 --> 01:34:15.800]   I'll do one if you don't want to do one.
[01:34:15.800 --> 01:34:16.800]   Okay.
[01:34:16.800 --> 01:34:17.800]   Well, okay.
[01:34:17.800 --> 01:34:19.840]   I'll then now I've been put up a shout out mode.
[01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:23.720]   But this is a really cool, really simple one that kind of makes you sort of smack your
[01:34:23.720 --> 01:34:26.120]   heads and what I figured out this before.
[01:34:26.120 --> 01:34:29.720]   You see that you see the row of really cool dedicated function keys on the top of your
[01:34:29.720 --> 01:34:33.960]   keyboard for getting, you know, for adjusting the volume, for adjusting the screen brightness,
[01:34:33.960 --> 01:34:40.400]   for getting into getting into launch pad expose and dashboard, that sort of stuff.
[01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:46.000]   Well, you know that there are also settings pages for those inside system preps.
[01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:50.520]   What you probably didn't know is that if you hold down the option key on the keyboard,
[01:34:50.520 --> 01:34:55.080]   then touch that function key, it will take you immediately to the system preps for that
[01:34:55.080 --> 01:34:56.080]   feature.
[01:34:56.080 --> 01:34:57.080]   No.
[01:34:57.080 --> 01:34:59.440]   So if you hit off, you hold on the option key and type one of the volume keys, I'll take
[01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:01.480]   you into the sound settings.
[01:35:01.480 --> 01:35:04.760]   If you told on the option key and hit when the brightness things will take you immediately
[01:35:04.760 --> 01:35:09.640]   to the screen settings, even the keyboard brightness key will take you to immediately
[01:35:09.640 --> 01:35:11.000]   to the keyboard settings.
[01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.400]   Oh, Andy, I know.
[01:35:13.400 --> 01:35:20.000]   I got this just by sort of like it just, I don't know why I just popped into my head.
[01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:24.040]   Like one day, I wonder what happens if you hold out the option key and type these like,
[01:35:24.040 --> 01:35:26.320]   Oh my God, that's actually very clever of them.
[01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:27.920]   Why didn't I know about this?
[01:35:27.920 --> 01:35:29.080]   Oh my gosh.
[01:35:29.080 --> 01:35:31.160]   I echo M. Lewis in our chat room.
[01:35:31.160 --> 01:35:32.960]   A tip of the hat, sir.
[01:35:32.960 --> 01:35:33.960]   Well played.
[01:35:33.960 --> 01:35:34.960]   Like healthy.
[01:35:34.960 --> 01:35:36.560]   I had no idea.
[01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:37.800]   That's going to save me so much time.
[01:35:37.800 --> 01:35:41.880]   So if we want to go, for instance, to display control panel instead of clicking around, I
[01:35:41.880 --> 01:35:47.600]   just press option and the brightness key, there's a display control panel option and
[01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:54.720]   expose key gives me the expose settings, the mission control settings.
[01:35:54.720 --> 01:35:56.440]   Keyboard light gives me the keyboard settings.
[01:35:56.440 --> 01:35:59.280]   Boy, this is great.
[01:35:59.280 --> 01:36:01.680]   Playback or audio gives me the sound control.
[01:36:01.680 --> 01:36:02.680]   That's boy.
[01:36:02.680 --> 01:36:03.680]   That's nice.
[01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:04.680]   Okay.
[01:36:04.680 --> 01:36:05.680]   Thank you.
[01:36:05.680 --> 01:36:06.680]   You win.
[01:36:06.680 --> 01:36:07.920]   I'm not going to show mine.
[01:36:07.920 --> 01:36:09.680]   Go ahead.
[01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:15.560]   No, actually, for those of you who have retina displays, and I know that's a tiny fraction,
[01:36:15.560 --> 01:36:20.440]   but one of the first things you notice immediately is my wallpaper looks crappy.
[01:36:20.440 --> 01:36:23.160]   Apple does have some, you know, standards, but I like to use the Apple wallpaper.
[01:36:23.160 --> 01:36:25.160]   I always have some nature scenes and stuff.
[01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:27.240]   And all of the stuff was old.
[01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:32.520]   So I found a website highly recommended called interface lift.
[01:36:32.520 --> 01:36:34.080]   And I'm sure you all know about it.
[01:36:34.080 --> 01:36:36.720]   interfacelift.com.
[01:36:36.720 --> 01:36:41.080]   And they have, they're very smart.
[01:36:41.080 --> 01:36:48.760]   28, there it is, 2880 by 1800 wallpapers that are gorgeous.
[01:36:48.760 --> 01:36:50.560]   And it's free to download.
[01:36:50.560 --> 01:36:55.360]   They do have a downloader, which I did, which I think is worth, or penny a, a penny a page.
[01:36:55.360 --> 01:37:00.000]   And in this case, they now have 278 retina quality wallpapers.
[01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:01.760]   They also have other sizes.
[01:37:01.760 --> 01:37:06.640]   But if you, if you want to do the bulk download services, a penny, so it'd be $2.78 to get
[01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:08.760]   all of them.
[01:37:08.760 --> 01:37:12.000]   And I did that because it was really worth, it was really, really worth it.
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:15.560]   They have great stuff in every resolution too.
[01:37:15.560 --> 01:37:17.680]   And it's sorted by resolution.
[01:37:17.680 --> 01:37:19.640]   And that's nice.
[01:37:19.640 --> 01:37:20.640]   Really nice.
[01:37:20.640 --> 01:37:26.120]   So interfacelift.com free if you want to do it one by one, onesie Tuesday.
[01:37:26.120 --> 01:37:28.880]   Now though, there's, there's more new ones all the time.
[01:37:28.880 --> 01:37:31.400]   So I have to download more of them.
[01:37:31.400 --> 01:37:32.520]   All right.
[01:37:32.520 --> 01:37:36.480]   Now your pick of the week, Mr. Renee Ritchie.
[01:37:36.480 --> 01:37:39.240]   My pick is from app cubby and David Barnard.
[01:37:39.240 --> 01:37:41.440]   And it's called launch center pro.
[01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:44.400]   It's a new version of a launch center app he had out previously.
[01:37:44.400 --> 01:37:47.360]   But I mean, this really puts the pro in pro.
[01:37:47.360 --> 01:37:49.400]   And basically with iOS, you can launch apps.
[01:37:49.400 --> 01:37:52.800]   The entire reason we have the home screen and no widgets.
[01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:57.040]   Oh, nothing else basically is because Apple wants you not to hang around and play in the
[01:37:57.040 --> 01:37:58.520]   home screen, but go into apps.
[01:37:58.520 --> 01:38:03.600]   And what David did is he put together this launch center pro and you can launch actions.
[01:38:03.600 --> 01:38:07.440]   So you can hit a button and launch a Google search based on your clipboard, or you can
[01:38:07.440 --> 01:38:11.280]   launch an action into omni focus, or you can launch a tweet.
[01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:15.560]   And we didn't get any sort of contracts or intents with iOS six.
[01:38:15.560 --> 01:38:19.800]   So there's two inter app communication, but there are these URL schemes.
[01:38:19.800 --> 01:38:25.560]   So apps can take information from a URL and he's busy cataloging the bit Jesus out of
[01:38:25.560 --> 01:38:28.640]   all these URLs and adding them into launch center pro.
[01:38:28.640 --> 01:38:33.160]   So any app that surfaces these, he can grab them and you can directly do things in those
[01:38:33.160 --> 01:38:35.080]   apps right from launch center.
[01:38:35.080 --> 01:38:36.280]   And it's in my doc now.
[01:38:36.280 --> 01:38:40.840]   And I used it all through WWDC and it saved me a tremendous amount of time and
[01:38:40.840 --> 01:38:41.840]   aggravation.
[01:38:41.840 --> 01:38:42.840]   Very nice.
[01:38:42.840 --> 01:38:43.840]   How much is that?
[01:38:43.840 --> 01:38:44.840]   Two ninety nine.
[01:38:44.840 --> 01:38:45.840]   Yes.
[01:38:45.840 --> 01:38:46.840]   And well worth it.
[01:38:46.840 --> 01:38:49.760]   App copy launch center pro.
[01:38:49.760 --> 01:38:52.280]   Ken Ray got a pick for us.
[01:38:52.280 --> 01:38:54.960]   I'm going to revisit one that you guys actually did about a year ago.
[01:38:54.960 --> 01:38:58.520]   And I know because I was on the show where you and done did it.
[01:38:58.520 --> 01:39:00.960]   I'm going back to Spotify.
[01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:03.560]   And the reason I'm doing that is because they it was really cute.
[01:39:03.560 --> 01:39:06.600]   They put out an iOS update this week.
[01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:11.480]   And there was a joke at the bottom of the iOS update that fixes this fixes this fixes
[01:39:11.480 --> 01:39:12.480]   this.
[01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:13.880]   And I was thinking that this was fiction.
[01:39:13.880 --> 01:39:16.000]   This update allergic to nuts.
[01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:21.720]   And so I and so I posted that just a screenshot of that on Instagram and said, you know, I
[01:39:21.720 --> 01:39:22.720]   think there it is.
[01:39:22.720 --> 01:39:24.040]   This version is allergic to nuts.
[01:39:24.040 --> 01:39:27.880]   And and I thought, you know, I posted that because I thought it was funny and somebody
[01:39:27.880 --> 01:39:31.120]   wrote to me and said, okay, is this really better than iTunes match?
[01:39:31.120 --> 01:39:35.120]   There are people who don't know the difference between the two.
[01:39:35.120 --> 01:39:37.120]   So it's just sort of a reintroduction.
[01:39:37.120 --> 01:39:38.880]   Spotify is a subscription music service.
[01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:40.720]   You don't have to pay, but that has ads.
[01:39:40.720 --> 01:39:45.200]   You can pay $4.99 and then you get it out free and you pay $9.99 I think a month and you
[01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:46.600]   get it on portable devices.
[01:39:46.600 --> 01:39:49.360]   So like I've got it on my iPad and on my iPhone.
[01:39:49.360 --> 01:39:50.880]   I pay for it.
[01:39:50.880 --> 01:39:51.880]   It's well worth it.
[01:39:51.880 --> 01:39:55.440]   They've also added a radio feature now to the iOS version, which is great.
[01:39:55.440 --> 01:40:00.120]   They've added the radio feature and then on the desktop side, I'm really a fan of the
[01:40:00.120 --> 01:40:05.080]   social side of it, which when you and Don McAllister were talking about it last year,
[01:40:05.080 --> 01:40:06.800]   I was kind of like, well, I don't really care.
[01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:08.520]   But it turns out I really do enjoy that.
[01:40:08.520 --> 01:40:11.240]   I'm liking, you know, seeing what my friends are playing and discovering music through
[01:40:11.240 --> 01:40:13.200]   some of the stuff that they do.
[01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:16.120]   They've also added their app stores section in the past year.
[01:40:16.120 --> 01:40:18.080]   It doesn't cost anything.
[01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:22.280]   Most of the apps I am not that big a fan of, but there's one that I love called, I believe
[01:40:22.280 --> 01:40:25.640]   it's, oh, is it, it might be tune wiki.
[01:40:25.640 --> 01:40:26.640]   I can't remember.
[01:40:26.640 --> 01:40:27.640]   Yeah, I think it is.
[01:40:27.640 --> 01:40:28.840]   Basically when you start a song.
[01:40:28.840 --> 01:40:33.000]   Yeah, when you start a song, you click on the tune wiki app and it plays for you as
[01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:37.640]   long as the publisher has not ripped them down, which does happen occasionally.
[01:40:37.640 --> 01:40:42.280]   But it runs the lyrics right along with the song as it's going.
[01:40:42.280 --> 01:40:45.760]   So you can use it as sort of a cheap karaoke machine if you want to, or you can finally
[01:40:45.760 --> 01:40:49.480]   understand, you know, what they're saying at that one part that you just always make
[01:40:49.480 --> 01:40:52.000]   up noise when that part of the song comes along.
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:56.600]   So that's, I mean, that's, and that's, and it's honestly one of the apps that I use most
[01:40:56.600 --> 01:41:00.600]   because I keep music playing while I'm writing.
[01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:02.240]   I love, I love Spotify.
[01:41:02.240 --> 01:41:06.120]   In fact, I, yeah, but I use it, I use it on my Sonos, but you could use it with Airplay
[01:41:06.120 --> 01:41:07.840]   with your Apple TV as well.
[01:41:07.840 --> 01:41:08.840]   Which I do.
[01:41:08.840 --> 01:41:09.840]   Yeah.
[01:41:09.840 --> 01:41:10.840]   Yeah.
[01:41:10.840 --> 01:41:11.840]   No, it's great.
[01:41:11.840 --> 01:41:13.280]   It's Spotify is a great music service and the radio is kind of Pandora like.
[01:41:13.280 --> 01:41:15.920]   So that's pretty cool.
[01:41:15.920 --> 01:41:18.520]   Andy, your pick of the week.
[01:41:18.520 --> 01:41:22.840]   Mine is a, is a kind of esoteric little camera app that I really, really like.
[01:41:22.840 --> 01:41:27.400]   It's called Huellis H-U-E-L-E-S-S buck 99.
[01:41:27.400 --> 01:41:32.640]   And what it is, I've got it on the screen back behind me, it is a exclusively black
[01:41:32.640 --> 01:41:34.240]   and white camera app.
[01:41:34.240 --> 01:41:36.000]   And you think, oh, well, what's the point of that?
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:40.240]   Because every, every app that I have has a special cute, cute Instagram, like black
[01:41:40.240 --> 01:41:41.440]   and white photo mode.
[01:41:41.440 --> 01:41:45.600]   Well, the difference is that this actually shows you the world in black and white.
[01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:49.800]   And if you're interested in black and white photography, you appreciate that part of it
[01:41:49.800 --> 01:41:53.840]   is understanding how good or how different an image looks when you strip out the color.
[01:41:53.840 --> 01:41:56.880]   So you frame and you can, you compose an image a little bit differently.
[01:41:56.880 --> 01:42:00.360]   You see the scene a little bit differently when you see it black and white.
[01:42:00.360 --> 01:42:04.200]   And the other really cool thing, I'm going to zoom in so you can see the effects.
[01:42:04.200 --> 01:42:10.440]   People of a certain age who learned how to photograph in black and white also learned
[01:42:10.440 --> 01:42:17.280]   that there's sort of a standard suite of filters, actual physical filters that have cool effects.
[01:42:17.280 --> 01:42:20.800]   So this actually will mimic the effect of having red, green and blue, red, green and
[01:42:20.800 --> 01:42:21.960]   yellow filters.
[01:42:21.960 --> 01:42:26.480]   So here's the same image that I had on the background right there, just to show you the
[01:42:26.480 --> 01:42:27.480]   difference.
[01:42:27.480 --> 01:42:29.440]   Right now there's no filter applied.
[01:42:29.440 --> 01:42:33.440]   So now I'm going to, that's what that looks like with a red filter.
[01:42:33.440 --> 01:42:38.440]   And then if I change that to a green filter, the tones are a lot different.
[01:42:38.440 --> 01:42:41.720]   I change now to a blue filter becomes completely different.
[01:42:41.720 --> 01:42:45.840]   So you can do things like if you want to, if you, how many times you've taken a picture
[01:42:45.840 --> 01:42:51.480]   of a sky like an hour before there's a thunderstorm and you think, Oh my God, such beautiful
[01:42:51.480 --> 01:42:55.280]   like 10 Commandman style wrath of God type clouds.
[01:42:55.280 --> 01:42:57.280]   Then you take a picture of it with a regular camera.
[01:42:57.280 --> 01:42:59.600]   Oh, that just doesn't look nearly as cool.
[01:42:59.600 --> 01:43:04.000]   Well, you can drop in a filter that makes it makes the clouds wider and makes the blues
[01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:07.080]   of the sky almost like black as night.
[01:43:07.080 --> 01:43:09.800]   And so you get immense contrast between the two.
[01:43:09.800 --> 01:43:13.360]   You can use oftentimes a filter to sort of soften tones and skin.
[01:43:13.360 --> 01:43:18.840]   If you want to get that sort of herberates effect when you're taking a picture of somebody,
[01:43:18.840 --> 01:43:20.360]   it's a fun thing to play around with.
[01:43:20.360 --> 01:43:24.360]   If you get into the mindset of taking pictures of black and white, you'll find yourself
[01:43:24.360 --> 01:43:26.920]   thinking, Hey, that kind of might be a good scene.
[01:43:26.920 --> 01:43:28.680]   You wonder what it looked like in black and white.
[01:43:28.680 --> 01:43:30.520]   And then you realize, Oh, it looks great in black and white.
[01:43:30.520 --> 01:43:33.800]   I wonder what it looked like with a green filter apply that would make that would make
[01:43:33.800 --> 01:43:36.120]   the leaves look really, really different in this scene.
[01:43:36.120 --> 01:43:37.240]   Oh, wow, looks really cool.
[01:43:37.240 --> 01:43:38.520]   Let's take that picture too.
[01:43:38.520 --> 01:43:40.080]   So it's buck 99.
[01:43:40.080 --> 01:43:44.520]   It sort of underscores that there's no one really great camera app for the iPhone.
[01:43:44.520 --> 01:43:48.400]   It's more like you will have the sort of a little gun belt of apps, each of which does
[01:43:48.400 --> 01:43:51.560]   one really cool thing that you'll cycle through.
[01:43:51.560 --> 01:43:54.200]   But if you keep remembering that you have a cool black and white camera somewhere on
[01:43:54.200 --> 01:43:56.520]   that gun belt, you'll probably wind up using it a bit.
[01:43:56.520 --> 01:43:57.520]   Thank you, Andy.
[01:43:57.520 --> 01:43:58.520]   Very nice.
[01:43:58.520 --> 01:44:04.360]   I want to show something that maybe you guys remember as Greplin, which was about the worst
[01:44:04.360 --> 01:44:06.000]   name for an app ever.
[01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:07.760]   It's an iPhone app.
[01:44:07.760 --> 01:44:09.720]   They've renamed it and reversioned it.
[01:44:09.720 --> 01:44:11.720]   And it really is actually pretty spectacular.
[01:44:11.720 --> 01:44:12.720]   It's free.
[01:44:12.720 --> 01:44:16.800]   It's called Q, C U E. Know what's next.
[01:44:16.800 --> 01:44:19.560]   Now you're not going to like this if you're one of those people who says, I don't want
[01:44:19.560 --> 01:44:23.000]   to upload my contact information in the cloud or whatever.
[01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:24.400]   I don't care about privacy.
[01:44:24.400 --> 01:44:26.120]   So I put Q on my iPhone.
[01:44:26.120 --> 01:44:32.480]   And what it does is you give it email, you give it your LinkedIn, your Facebook, everything.
[01:44:32.480 --> 01:44:35.200]   I don't know if you might have to zoom in on this one.
[01:44:35.200 --> 01:44:37.240]   And then it makes up a page for you each day.
[01:44:37.240 --> 01:44:38.400]   You see, this is the 26th.
[01:44:38.400 --> 01:44:41.880]   So it's building the page from all of my contacts for my calendars and everything of
[01:44:41.880 --> 01:44:42.880]   what I'm doing.
[01:44:42.880 --> 01:44:44.040]   It says up next to it photo.
[01:44:44.040 --> 01:44:45.880]   Oh, gosh, I better hurry up.
[01:44:45.880 --> 01:44:46.880]   It shows.
[01:44:46.880 --> 01:44:53.640]   And if I say who scheduled that meeting, for instance, I can tap that and I can see who's
[01:44:53.640 --> 01:45:00.280]   scheduled a meeting and I can see if that meeting's been canceled, I can text.
[01:45:00.280 --> 01:45:02.600]   It's got my texts in there.
[01:45:02.600 --> 01:45:04.240]   It crashed.
[01:45:04.240 --> 01:45:06.160]   It's got a lot of phone numbers, which I'm now showing.
[01:45:06.160 --> 01:45:08.200]   So I probably shouldn't do that.
[01:45:08.200 --> 01:45:09.200]   It builds.
[01:45:09.200 --> 01:45:11.400]   Let me show the screenshots from the app page.
[01:45:11.400 --> 01:45:12.880]   That's probably a better idea.
[01:45:12.880 --> 01:45:13.880]   But this is all live.
[01:45:13.880 --> 01:45:17.800]   So if you're going to be late for a meeting, for instance, you can click the name of the
[01:45:17.800 --> 01:45:20.320]   organizer and send them a text.
[01:45:20.320 --> 01:45:25.600]   You see if an event is a flight, for instance, they'll show you the confirmation code.
[01:45:25.600 --> 01:45:27.120]   It gives you a lot of information.
[01:45:27.120 --> 01:45:29.680]   It's kind of like a calendar on steroids.
[01:45:29.680 --> 01:45:34.280]   And it lets you interface between your contacts or calendars and everything that's going on.
[01:45:34.280 --> 01:45:35.440]   It's really sweet.
[01:45:35.440 --> 01:45:39.520]   It's really kind of cool.
[01:45:39.520 --> 01:45:40.960]   It's called Q and it's free.
[01:45:40.960 --> 01:45:41.960]   It does.
[01:45:41.960 --> 01:45:42.960]   It syncs with eye cal.
[01:45:42.960 --> 01:45:43.960]   It syncs with all of you.
[01:45:43.960 --> 01:45:46.960]   You tell it what you want to sync with.
[01:45:46.960 --> 01:45:50.720]   It's free for $4.99 a month or $50 a year.
[01:45:50.720 --> 01:45:56.080]   You can have it synced with more professional stuff like LinkedIn.
[01:45:56.080 --> 01:45:58.440]   But the free thing is very, very capable.
[01:45:58.440 --> 01:46:01.920]   Facebook, Twitter, it's really kind of a neat app.
[01:46:01.920 --> 01:46:02.920]   Try it.
[01:46:02.920 --> 01:46:04.320]   Do the free thing and see if you like it.
[01:46:04.320 --> 01:46:10.160]   It's formally called Greplin, now called Q. No, C-U-E.
[01:46:10.160 --> 01:46:13.200]   DMX, C-U-E.
[01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:16.160]   And yeah, it'll let me send the chat room a message when I know I'm going to be late.
[01:46:16.160 --> 01:46:17.160]   That's right.
[01:46:17.160 --> 01:46:19.200]   I wish I could.
[01:46:19.200 --> 01:46:22.720]   If you all, you know, if that would be kind of cool, what I need is an email address to
[01:46:22.720 --> 01:46:23.720]   the chat room.
[01:46:23.720 --> 01:46:25.480]   I would do that.
[01:46:25.480 --> 01:46:26.480]   Get me one of these.
[01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:31.120]   By the way, these are some of the interface lift desktop images that just look so good.
[01:46:31.120 --> 01:46:33.280]   I love my retina display.
[01:46:33.280 --> 01:46:34.880]   I can't put it down.
[01:46:34.880 --> 01:46:38.560]   I go to bed with it at night.
[01:46:38.560 --> 01:46:39.560]   Tell it all your secrets.
[01:46:39.560 --> 01:46:40.560]   I do.
[01:46:40.560 --> 01:46:41.560]   Do each other's hair.
[01:46:41.560 --> 01:46:43.560]   Are you happy with the Anki model Leo?
[01:46:43.560 --> 01:46:44.560]   Because I've been waiting for a second.
[01:46:44.560 --> 01:46:45.560]   Yeah, I got the base model.
[01:46:45.560 --> 01:46:46.560]   I got the 8 gig.
[01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:47.880]   I got 256 gig hard drive.
[01:46:47.880 --> 01:46:50.160]   I didn't pay more than the base model.
[01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:51.880]   And yeah, it's very, boy, it's fast.
[01:46:51.880 --> 01:46:56.760]   I was showing before the show, I was showing benchmarks for the hard drive spectacular.
[01:46:56.760 --> 01:46:57.760]   Very fast.
[01:46:57.760 --> 01:46:58.760]   Luscious.
[01:46:58.760 --> 01:47:00.760]   And not too, people are worried about it being hot.
[01:47:00.760 --> 01:47:01.680]   It's not hot.
[01:47:01.680 --> 01:47:04.720]   I know, you know, somebody said, oh, it's too heavy.
[01:47:04.720 --> 01:47:05.720]   It's not that heavy.
[01:47:05.720 --> 01:47:06.720]   Come on.
[01:47:06.720 --> 01:47:08.440]   What do we turn to a bunch of panty waists?
[01:47:08.440 --> 01:47:09.880]   It's only four and a half pounds.
[01:47:09.880 --> 01:47:10.880]   Be a man.
[01:47:10.880 --> 01:47:11.880]   Pick up your MacBook.
[01:47:11.880 --> 01:47:12.880]   Be a man.
[01:47:12.880 --> 01:47:13.880]   Get over it.
[01:47:13.880 --> 01:47:16.680]   Oh, if we're panty waists, we used to be milk toast.
[01:47:16.680 --> 01:47:17.680]   That's right.
[01:47:17.680 --> 01:47:20.360]   We've gotten better.
[01:47:20.360 --> 01:47:26.080]   Mr. Ken Ray does a podcast every day called Mac OS Ken at Mac OS Ken.com.
[01:47:26.080 --> 01:47:32.200]   You must subscribe in the new iTunes Podcasts app and listen to him and come back soon because
[01:47:32.200 --> 01:47:33.200]   you're great.
[01:47:33.200 --> 01:47:34.200]   I love having you on.
[01:47:34.200 --> 01:47:35.200]   Thanks a lot, Leo.
[01:47:35.200 --> 01:47:36.200]   I appreciate it.
[01:47:36.200 --> 01:47:37.200]   Great to see you.
[01:47:37.200 --> 01:47:38.200]   Same thing with Renee.
[01:47:38.200 --> 01:47:39.200]   Boy, you're fantastic.
[01:47:39.200 --> 01:47:40.200]   I'm more.com.
[01:47:40.200 --> 01:47:41.200]   Renee, Richie, Editor-in-Chief there.
[01:47:41.200 --> 01:47:42.200]   I-M-O-R-E.com.
[01:47:42.200 --> 01:47:45.520]   You said you do podcast too.
[01:47:45.520 --> 01:47:46.520]   We do.
[01:47:46.520 --> 01:47:48.520]   In fact, we have the 300th episode of our show tomorrow.
[01:47:48.520 --> 01:47:51.600]   If you search for mobile nations, you'll find a whole lot of them.
[01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:52.600]   Fantastic.
[01:47:52.600 --> 01:47:53.600]   That's great.
[01:47:53.600 --> 01:47:54.600]   Congratulations on episode 300.
[01:47:54.600 --> 01:47:55.600]   You're very much.
[01:47:55.600 --> 01:47:58.960]   Leo, you gave us a bunch of advice on how to do it right at Mac world a couple of years
[01:47:58.960 --> 01:48:01.520]   ago and we implemented all of it and it's been fantastic.
[01:48:01.520 --> 01:48:04.520]   Stop telling people how to do this stuff.
[01:48:04.520 --> 01:48:06.960]   Anyway, great to have you, Renee.
[01:48:06.960 --> 01:48:07.960]   Please come back soon also.
[01:48:07.960 --> 01:48:08.960]   Absolutely.
[01:48:08.960 --> 01:48:10.400]   And we can't get rid of Andy Inako.
[01:48:10.400 --> 01:48:15.000]   He's the star of the show at Chicago Sun Time, Celestial Waste of Bandwidth, Mr. Inako.
[01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.040]   Always a pleasure.
[01:48:17.040 --> 01:48:18.040]   Always a slice, Leo.
[01:48:18.040 --> 01:48:19.040]   Thanks for being here.
[01:48:19.040 --> 01:48:20.040]   Thank you all for joining us.
[01:48:20.040 --> 01:48:24.520]   We do Mac break weekly when Leo shows up on time at 11 a.m. Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern
[01:48:24.520 --> 01:48:25.520]   time.
[01:48:25.520 --> 01:48:26.520]   We welcome you into the audience.
[01:48:26.520 --> 01:48:27.520]   We're going to set up a new email.
[01:48:27.520 --> 01:48:31.600]   I think I want to set up tickets at twit.tv because that just makes more sense.
[01:48:31.600 --> 01:48:35.760]   I have you emailing my sister right now, but how is going to remember Eva at twit.tv?
[01:48:35.760 --> 01:48:37.720]   So tickets, but we'll set that up.
[01:48:37.720 --> 01:48:38.880]   But you don't have to get tickets.
[01:48:38.880 --> 01:48:39.880]   You just show up.
[01:48:39.880 --> 01:48:41.240]   Just that way, we'll have a chair for you.
[01:48:41.240 --> 01:48:44.320]   Otherwise, you're sitting on the floor.
[01:48:44.320 --> 01:48:49.040]   But to come, you know, being in the chat room or listening live, you don't even, you could
[01:48:49.040 --> 01:48:52.000]   arrange your own beverage and seed as well.
[01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:55.880]   That's 11 a.m. Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern time, 1,800 UTC on twit.tv.
[01:48:55.880 --> 01:48:59.240]   After the, every Tuesday, after the fact, we got audio and video for you.
[01:48:59.240 --> 01:49:00.720]   Just go and download it.
[01:49:00.720 --> 01:49:06.440]   We will do live coverage of Google I/O tomorrow, 9 30 a.m. Pacific, 12 30 Eastern time.
[01:49:06.440 --> 01:49:13.200]   If you want to find out what Google's up to TNT coming up this afternoon with the latest
[01:49:13.200 --> 01:49:16.960]   tech news 3 p.m. Pacific, but we're going to get ready right now for twit photo.
[01:49:16.960 --> 01:49:17.960]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:49:17.960 --> 01:49:18.960]   I'll see you next time.
[01:49:18.960 --> 01:49:19.960]   Now get back to work.
[01:49:19.960 --> 01:49:20.960]   Break time is over.
[01:49:20.960 --> 01:49:21.960]   Yay.
[01:49:21.960 --> 01:49:22.960]   Bravo.
[01:49:22.960 --> 01:49:23.960]   Yes.
[01:49:23.960 --> 01:49:24.960]   White clap.
[01:49:24.960 --> 01:49:25.960]   Golf golf.
[01:49:25.960 --> 01:49:32.960]   White clap.
[01:49:32.960 --> 01:49:35.540]   (upbeat music)
[01:49:35.540 --> 01:49:38.120]   (upbeat music)
