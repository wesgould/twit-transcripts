[00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.900]   Apple Music comes to Facebook Messenger?
[00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:09.900]   What?
[00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.400]   Well, let's talk about the very interesting Marco Arment article about what Apple did
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.900]   wrong with the Mac Pro and what they should do next.
[00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.700]   And a question for Nvidia.
[00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.800]   Are you thinking Hackintosh?
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.000]   It's all coming up next on Mac Break Weekly.

[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   The latest news from Apple is starting to my right, Renee Richie from iMore.com and the
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   great Frozen North, which is apparently melting.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   It's melting and it's melting so fast that the snow has turned to water before the ground
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   can unfreeze.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   So now there's just water everywhere and my hot has turned to Dagobah.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Oh, interesting.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Usually I can walk along the beach.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Now there's no beach.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   It's just trees that are underwater.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   And it's like dirty, muddy spring water.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   We learn so much on this show.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   It's Meteorological Weekly, Brave Weekly.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   Also from the Great Northeast and the Inako and the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Great to have you.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Somewhere in New England.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Yes, we had an undisclosed location.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Marathon South, I will say.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Is today the Marathon?
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   No, yesterday was the Marathon.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   I didn't get my finishers battle, but I didn't even try Cap.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   You know who might have gotten a finisher's medal.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   She's a runner along with her husband.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   They've both been on the show, but I've never had Tonya angst on the show when I'm here.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Tonya, it's so great to have you from tidbits.com.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   Hi, it is great to be here from Ithaca, New York where it is mud season.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   So if you're a trail runner, you're very muddy and I am a trail runner.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   So there's a lot of mud.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Mud and daffodils going on here.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   Don't show us your legs.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   They're all covered with mud.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   Look at all those numbers behind you.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Wasn't that a moving and important picture from 1967 of the first woman to run in the Boston Marathon
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   who registered with just her initials so they didn't know she was a woman.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   It was an all male event at the time.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   And there's a picture that's very famous of the race official.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   I think actually the creator of the race trying to physically take her out of,
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   get out of my race, he said.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   She was able to run on it.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   Give me that number.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   Give me that number.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   She was able to run on and that number, Catherine Switzer, appeared 261 once again yesterday
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   in the Boston Marathon as she ran it legally and officially.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   Which is just such a great story, such a wonderful story.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   And so she was a pioneer that made it possible for women to run in the Boston Marathon.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   She showed that they could actually finish.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   See, Tonya, the men were just looking out for you women focus.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   You had to prove that you were not too frail.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   We just didn't want anything to happen when we were done.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   We didn't want to get beat.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   Let's just say running culture has changed a lot.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   This was before Title IX.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   This is 1967.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   We were still mired in some.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   We had a few prejudice.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   Hidden runners.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   They retired that number, by the way, 261.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   That's pretty cool.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   Wow, there's actually a lot to talk about in the Apple world today.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   I'll start with something that just happened.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   We were right before the show streaming the live keynote, Mark Zuckerberg and company at
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   the Facebook Developers Conference, F8.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   And towards the end they talked about the Messenger platform and announced that Apple
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   Music and Spotify, both will be making Messenger bots that you can play music, live stream
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   music from your Facebook Messenger.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   If you have a subscription, Apple Music is...
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   Oh, my dreams are made real.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   Is it?
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   No.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   I'm trying to figure out who wants this.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   It's like such a traditional technology.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   I don't know.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   It just seems like we can do this and this is where it fits now so we'll do it and it's
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   not a long term.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   I just can't imagine sitting there typing my music all day.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   It seems like maybe I'm old.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   But there are a lot of people who use Facebook as their front door to the entire Internet.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   And so the most...
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   The more things that can be done by sharing, the most of the things being done by that
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.360]   feed, the less their chances of ever stepping out into the real world where they can actually
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.840]   do things unobserved.
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.080]   But yeah, it's a very smart move for Apple.
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.480]   You don't want to prevent people from being able to access your service wherever they happen
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.120]   to access music from.
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.120]   So I'm with you.
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.600]   I would never use it that way, but I'm glad that it's the people who can use it that way
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.120]   and like to can use it that way.
[00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.440]   It's like a text-based adventure.
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:54.880]   I pick up Apple Music.
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:55.880]   I turn left.
[00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:56.880]   I talk along the forest.
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:57.880]   I play title.
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:58.880]   All right.
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:05.520]   You have to tell us, Tonya, what's your favorite music app?
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:11.720]   My favorite music app right now is Spotify for everything in the house.
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:20.000]   But I'm using Apple Music on my iPhone/AppleWatch a lot because I have Bluetooth earbud to my
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.440]   watch and I can listen to tunes while I run.
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.440]   I do like that actually.
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.840]   Bluetooth with the AirPods particularly.
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.240]   Can you run with the AirPods?
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:36.560]   You know, I don't have an AirPod yet, but I have this like $10 cheapo thing.
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.880]   It charges on like a four inch long USB cable.
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.000]   And it's just this little earbud thing.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.440]   You stick it in your ear.
[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.760]   And if you lose it in a stream, you don't care because it was 10 bucks.
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:48.760]   Right.
[00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:49.760]   Yeah, 160 bucks.
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.800]   You really don't want to lose those AirPods.
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:52.800]   It's really cool.
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.400]   We had Brian Hall on the podcast this week and he was formally head of service.
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:58.920]   And Microsoft, but now he's a doppler and he was talking about how augmented reality
[00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:02.080]   through audio is coming faster than through video, which is what we talked about recently
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.080]   as well.
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.680]   And when you have like instant access to all your music in a little tiny thing that sits
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:08.560]   in your ear, it really is transformative.
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:14.840]   The other thing of course that in fact was the topic number one at F8 was Facebook entering
[00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:19.680]   the augmented reality space, something, you know, we've long heard rumors Apple was going
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:20.680]   to do.
[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:24.440]   And I think the pressure is on Apple now to announce something at its developers conference
[00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:27.040]   in June, WWDC.
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:33.560]   Facebook is going to basically enable the camera in the Facebook app to be an augmented reality
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:40.400]   tool and provide a platform for developers to add augmented reality capability within
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:41.400]   Facebook.
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:45.920]   Of course, you know, this begs the question of, you know, our developers burned by Facebook's
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:48.560]   multiple attempts to be a platform.
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:50.280]   Nevertheless, it's pretty exciting.
[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:51.880]   It looks pretty cool.
[00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:55.320]   Or maybe you don't think so, Tanya, you're laughing at it.
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:58.000]   Well, you know, I skim through the F8 thing.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.560]   So I didn't, I haven't watched the whole thing carefully yet, but it, I mean, it's going
[00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:04.760]   to have a lot of potential.
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:07.040]   It seemed kind of soft, more like right now.
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:08.800]   Yeah, it's kind of silly.
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:09.800]   Yeah.
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:14.160]   Just like for fun or, you know, you can imagine like middle school kids just getting in there
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.440]   and just going nuts with it.
[00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:21.600]   But I think where augmented reality gets really excited is in certain professions where being
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:27.200]   able to work on something, you know, with your hands or talking to other people is enhanced
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:32.280]   by being able to see something on an augmented reality, you know, display how they get that
[00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:36.240]   working so that you have access to more streams of information at once.
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:38.040]   That seems really interesting.
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:39.040]   Yeah.
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:42.960]   But, you know, putting beards and hats on photos is cool in Facebook, but it doesn't really
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.920]   rock my world.
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:49.560]   I think Facebook's ambitions for this, of course, go way beyond just another Snapchat
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:50.560]   filter.
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:53.440]   And because yesterday, Snapchat must have seen this coming.
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:56.120]   Snapchat announced their new world filters.
[00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:59.960]   So Snapchat's had for a long time filters that you turn on yourself, you know, turn yourself
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.200]   into something silly.
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:04.560]   But now when you go into the Snapchat filters, it says, "Turn your, you know, use the back
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:07.560]   camera and you can impose things on your world."
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:12.400]   Not in any way, nearly as sophisticated, however, as what Facebook was talking about.
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:14.720]   Facebook said, you know, "We know what the objects are.
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.040]   We can map around them.
[00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:18.440]   It could be a game, but it could be for business.
[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:24.320]   It could be, you know, it could be, you could add a second coffee cup next to the first coffee
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:25.320]   cup."
[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.080]   So we'll see how sophisticated it is.
[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:30.200]   And of course, it's going to be up to developers to implement it.
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.200]   But you know, it's interesting.
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.200]   But you know, it's interesting.
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.200]   You can have virtual hosts.
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:35.440]   You can just map back with me with three virtual Facebook hosts.
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:39.320]   You know, we've always thought instead of using, we call the screens you guys live in
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:43.440]   if you've ever seen the Twitter videos, avatars.
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:47.440]   And the idea of this was it would be like you're sitting at the table, but it's, you know,
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:53.240]   it's clearly you're inside a, you know, like zod and imprisoned inside a TV set.
[00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:57.840]   But we've always thought it would be kind of interesting to have a 3D hologram of you
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:58.960]   actually sitting at the table.
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.600]   We actually know we could do it.
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.920]   I've just been lazy.
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:04.920]   But it would be possible.
[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:06.920]   I like that they could do it with bubblegum.
[00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:07.920]   Yeah.
[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:11.920]   When you get the 3D hologram sitting at the table thing, I definitely want in on the beta
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:13.160]   test deal.
[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:16.240]   It's kind of creepy, but kind of fun too, right?
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:18.840]   You'd have to send somebody out to scan you, Tanya.
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:21.440]   Well, you know, that could happen.
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:22.440]   Yeah.
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:25.760]   And you wouldn't, you know, you could change hairstyles, change outfits.
[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:26.760]   You could be.
[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:27.920]   I always wanted to have blue hair.
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:28.920]   Perfect.
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:31.400]   You can start there easily, easily achieved with this technology.
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:32.400]   Yeah.
[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:33.400]   No problem.
[00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:34.400]   Yeah.
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.960]   But Tanya's just, was actually absolutely the mark.
[00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:40.840]   It seems as though the places that are really doing great things where they are right now,
[00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:45.360]   are people who are not trying to create the next Snapchat for VR or the next TV show or
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.520]   magazine or game.
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:52.160]   It's the people who can figure out a real specific need that it can address directly.
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:58.320]   Oddly enough, Google Glass, which of course, as an experiment, it was an experiment.
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.320]   But it's actually, Google never killed it.
[00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:04.800]   They kept it alive and saying that anybody who wants to buy it and develop on it.
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:07.960]   And so now they're actually a bunch of companies who are having some success by selling it to
[00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:11.920]   the medical field where, again, it's not for everybody in every situation.
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:18.040]   But when a doctor is forming a consultation, being able to have three or four people, other
[00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:22.160]   specialists all around the world, being able to see what this person sees and also throw
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:26.040]   in what they're doing into chat so they can ask their questions.
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:30.840]   I particularly want to bring it up because I had to search it to make sure I remembered
[00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:31.840]   it.
[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:36.640]   There was an actual story yesterday from the marathon where there was a visually man who
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:39.800]   was visually impaired who was wearing Google Glass.
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:45.560]   And essentially streaming his entire run to a helper or friend who was basically, again,
[00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:48.800]   watching his point of view and warning him that, okay, you need to turn left over here
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:52.520]   or, okay, there is a big, big, big pothole right in front of you.
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:56.320]   You may want to burr left in the next 20, in the next 20 yards.
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:58.200]   So that's, I'm excited.
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:03.080]   If I'm not yet excited about any one thing I've seen in AR, I'm excited when I hear about
[00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:08.720]   this other, this other avenue has decided to open up and basically allow clever people
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:14.800]   to figure out how to put AR into Facebook or figure out how to use AR creatively in
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:18.520]   YouTube because Google isn't going to figure out Facebook is going to figure out.
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:23.160]   It's going to be three people who suddenly decide that they wanted to go on three hours
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:26.080]   of sleep for four months because they have a great idea.
[00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:29.320]   And that's going to be the idea that's going to absolutely crack it for everybody.
[00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:33.200]   Not to belabor the point, but because this is, after all, Mac break weekly, but it's
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:39.400]   pretty clear that Facebook is responding to Snapchat.
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:42.160]   Remember that when Instagram became a threat they bought Instagram, when WhatsApp became
[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:46.080]   a threat they bought WhatsApp, they tried to buy Snap and Snap wouldn't sell.
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:47.920]   In fact, it was a wise decision.
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:52.480]   Evan Spiegel and company made more money through the IPO than Facebook would have offered them.
[00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:59.720]   So now, if you threatened by Snap and I presume Facebook is, the next step is to crush them.
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:01.800]   And this is clearly a response.
[00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:04.320]   And in fact, the markets responded.
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:08.400]   Snap had a big jump in the market yesterday after they announced their world filters.
[00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:12.720]   And most of those gains have been erased in the stock market as soon as Mark Zuckerberg
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:15.560]   took stage and started talking about his response.
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:18.800]   I mean, Google couldn't buy Facebook and so they tried it to do all sorts of social
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:20.000]   networks and it never worked.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.160]   And now Facebook is not the upstart anymore as the incumbent and there's people on their
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:25.160]   heels.
[00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:30.280]   Well, it's interesting because Facebook, there's a good story on Matt Honan in BuzzFeed today
[00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:35.080]   about how, you know, when you remember when Google did Google+, Facebook went, "Wah!"
[00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:41.680]   And they, and they battened down the hatches and they went, you know, 24/7 to find a response
[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:42.680]   to that.
[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:43.680]   Apparently the same...
[00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:44.680]   Dennedy identity.
[00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:45.680]   Yeah.
[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:50.680]   Apparently the same thing happened with Snap and Snapchat and, and that this is the, this
[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:55.080]   is the result of that, you know, six months ago saying, "We got to find a way to beat
[00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:56.580]   these guys."
[00:13:56.580 --> 00:14:03.620]   What's interesting is, anything Facebook does is within the walled garden is Facebook.
[00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:07.340]   Apple has an opportunity, by the way, Microsoft's ahead of everybody, although they don't have
[00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:10.840]   a consumer facing product yet, they have been doing HoloLens for a while.
[00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:12.000]   It'd be very interesting.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.940]   I think Apple and Microsoft are traditionally platform companies.
[00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:16.940]   Facebook's not.
[00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:21.940]   It's a social network, not a, but it may turn itself into a platform company.
[00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:26.540]   Does app, what does Apple announce in June or does Apple announce something in June?
[00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:28.780]   In response to this?
[00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:31.020]   I don't know what they can really announce.
[00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:36.220]   If, if, where the, where Facebook's announcements are really relevant to an Apple show is that
[00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:40.420]   Facebook is again, one of those places that they try to create a version of the web that
[00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:44.220]   are, that's comfortable to people that are not comfortable in the broader web.
[00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:48.900]   There are a lot of people that are very, very comfortable making the, making Facebook their
[00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:51.300]   portal to the entire internet.
[00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:54.700]   And the more they can do without leaving that familiar screen that they understand how,
[00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:56.260]   they understand how the screen works.
[00:14:56.260 --> 00:15:00.540]   The screen gives them photographs of their adorable grandchildren and nieces and nephews
[00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:02.340]   and, and stuff like that.
[00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:03.340]   The better it is for them.
[00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:09.260]   So it's going to be, I think it's, it's less a question of how can Apple create an augmented
[00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:13.460]   reality thing that's going to keep people from going away to other places.
[00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:17.740]   I think it's going to be more like, how can they make sure that they are still, they can
[00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:22.740]   still get money from people who don't necessarily own an Apple product as their primary device.
[00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:28.780]   Because remember that as much as we love the, love the Mac, it's still really a tiny minority
[00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:31.660]   of the desktops that are out there worldwide.
[00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:37.060]   The iPhone is, is still not the most popular phone platform in the world, which means that
[00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:40.620]   if Apple is going to continue to be as successful as they have been, they're going to have to
[00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:45.180]   make sure that they live in the world that they live in and not in a, a walled garden
[00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:46.180]   for themselves.
[00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:47.580]   I think they've grown up though.
[00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:51.220]   I mean, in the old days, we saw them try to make ping a social network for music and they
[00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:54.540]   were plans to make a social network for photons and it was just kind of awkward and like your
[00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:58.420]   dad's or your mom's social network trying to make one, not trying to live on one.
[00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:01.940]   And I think we've seen with clips, for example, a way where they didn't want to be Instagram,
[00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:04.660]   they didn't want to be Snapchat, they just wanted to make a front end that would let
[00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:08.260]   people sort of assemble videos that could live there or could live anywhere else more
[00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:09.260]   easily.
[00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:13.460]   And now I think their primary concern is even though they're not the most popular or the
[00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:17.620]   most numerous mobile platform, they still own the premium market and they want to make
[00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:21.660]   sure that people who do want to invest in iPhone or iPad have a really phenomenal Facebook
[00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:23.020]   or really phenomenal Instagram.
[00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:26.340]   They have really great cameras, really great sensors.
[00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:29.780]   And I watch people, for example, playing reality games out there and they're playing
[00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:33.140]   versus people with Android phones and all you hear is complaints, "Ah, it's glitching,
[00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:34.140]   I can't dodge."
[00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:37.620]   I'm, and they get really upset and a lot of them say, "I'm going to buy an iPhone,"
[00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:40.940]   because the people, even with an iPhone 6, they're playing smoothly, flawlessly.
[00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:44.340]   They're not missing dodges, they're not missing opportunities, they're getting great photos
[00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:47.860]   and that starts to matter to people more because the social, the peer group comes into play.
[00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:50.860]   And I think of Apple can constantly get the best of breed technology, the best of breed
[00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:51.860]   integration with those things.
[00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:56.500]   And they have a really compelling story in the premium end where they like to operate.
[00:16:56.500 --> 00:17:03.300]   Yeah, it feels like comparing Facebook to Apple, it's kind of like comparing, you know,
[00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:06.780]   like Apple's to Chinese food or something.
[00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:14.300]   They don't really seem similar pieces of produce or vegetables, fruit.
[00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:21.540]   So, I think Apple is going to have their usual mix of hardware and software improvements.
[00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:25.180]   It's all going to get better, it's going to work more smoothly together.
[00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:30.220]   Facebook will probably work on it, but I can't think that Apple is putting a lot of thought
[00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:35.740]   right now into how to compete with Facebook because they're just so very different.
[00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:42.180]   So, but if you credit the rumors and if you credit Robert Scobel, that Apple's going to
[00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:44.820]   make a big push into AR this year.
[00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:49.060]   So, you think that Apple, so you would, so if you were building a platform, then you
[00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:53.100]   go to the developers conference and say, "Hey developers, look what we've got."
[00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:56.740]   It's coming out in the iOS 11 this fall.
[00:17:56.740 --> 00:17:57.940]   AR kit.
[00:17:57.940 --> 00:17:58.940]   AR kit.
[00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:00.780]   Get to work.
[00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:02.180]   That's essentially what Facebook did to that.
[00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:03.180]   Get excited.
[00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:04.180]   Get excited.
[00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:05.180]   You don't anticipate something like that.
[00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:06.180]   Go develop it.
[00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:07.180]   You don't think they'll be AR kit.
[00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:08.180]   We will know.
[00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:09.180]   We will know.
[00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:10.180]   We will know.
[00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:11.180]   We will know.
[00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:16.420]   And sometimes they turn into real things with real apps, for real people pretty quickly,
[00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:21.040]   and other times it takes a really long time before we really see anything that would help
[00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:23.680]   Apple to compete beyond just attracting developers.
[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:25.600]   So you know, Tom will tell.
[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:34.340]   But can you do this with an iPhone, I ask you, this is transformative technology?
[00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:38.400]   This turns out you can do that, absolutely.
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:39.560]   Just perfectly well.
[00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:42.100]   This is actually, was done on an iPhone with Snapchat.
[00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:43.780]   This is their world filter.
[00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:45.380]   And the rumor is the camera is going to be even better.
[00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:48.700]   They'll have two cameras on the front as well, so you can do your depth selfies with
[00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:52.140]   proper form modeling and that sort of stuff appeals to people because, oh look on the
[00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:56.220]   new iPhone, I can have those rabbit ears perfectly placed and they track 100% with me.
[00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:57.460]   We're on the old iPhone or that Android phone.
[00:18:57.460 --> 00:18:58.460]   They're kind of janky.
[00:18:58.460 --> 00:18:59.460]   It looks like that ear is on my nose.
[00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:00.460]   Yeah.
[00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:03.820]   What was the number one app on Mac for years?
[00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:04.820]   Photo booth.
[00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:05.820]   Right?
[00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:08.420]   Because you could do those weird transformations.
[00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:12.760]   In the Apple store, everyone was using the, the, the photo with app.
[00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:14.360]   It was just a demo app of choice.
[00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:15.360]   Right.
[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:16.360]   All right.
[00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:17.360]   We're going to take a little break, come back.
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:23.100]   We will talk about Mark German's new article, kind of listing all of the rumors about what
[00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:26.560]   we will see with the 10th anniversary iPhone.
[00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:29.200]   And we'll talk about what that could mean.
[00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:31.640]   And Marco Arment's very interesting.
[00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:36.560]   I thought very well thought out article about the Mac Pro, what it should have been, what
[00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:38.360]   it could be.
[00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:39.360]   That's all coming up.
[00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:41.200]   Renee Richie is here from imore.com.
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:43.360]   Andy Naco from the Chicago Sun times.
[00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:46.160]   We welcome for the first time I've been here, Tonya.
[00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:47.160]   Thanks.
[00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:48.960]   Hey, congratulations.
[00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:49.960]   tidbits.
[00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:54.400]   I thought, you know, yesterday was, uh, twits 12th anniversary.
[00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:56.960]   I thought that was a long time in this business.
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:58.720]   You're celebrating what?
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:01.240]   27 years of doing tidbits.
[00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:02.240]   27.
[00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:03.240]   Oh my.
[00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:05.320]   What day is the actual anniversary?
[00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:08.320]   The actual anniversary was Monday.
[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:11.440]   Yesterday, just like us.
[00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:13.160]   Only you're 15 years older.
[00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:14.160]   Yeah.
[00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:16.520]   Well, we, uh, we started a really long time ago.
[00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:23.200]   So we actually had to convert tidbits to the web because there was no web when we started
[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:24.200]   the thing.
[00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:25.200]   Wow.
[00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:30.080]   So we published in a email format called C text structure enhanced text.
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:32.200]   It was a very new and exciting thing then.
[00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:37.000]   You actually can still read tidbits in a structure enhanced text if you so wish.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.160]   The Mac was only six years old when you started.
[00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:41.160]   Something like that.
[00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:42.160]   Yeah.
[00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:44.920]   I mean, that's she's, uh, that's really impressive.
[00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:45.920]   Well done.
[00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:46.920]   27 years old.
[00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:47.920]   Yeah.
[00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:49.920]   That means you started it when you were 15.
[00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:52.120]   Uh, a little older than that.
[00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:53.120]   Yeah.
[00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:55.120]   But you and Adam were pretty.
[00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:56.120]   Yeah.
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:59.520]   I mean, this was, was this something that you started just like right out of college?
[00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:01.560]   We were a couple of years out of college.
[00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:08.760]   I was working at Cornell University selling Mac and Tasha's next and IBM PCs to folks
[00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:10.400]   who wanted them there.
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:18.320]   Adam was doing independent consulting, making like databases and backups for local firms.
[00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:24.760]   And we just felt that the world needed a newsletter about what was up with Apple computer and
[00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:27.000]   other stuff, you know, like the HP desk jet.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.680]   We thought that was pretty cool when it came out.
[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:30.680]   I remember.
[00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:32.680]   And in Jet Trainer.
[00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:33.960]   So we started the thing.
[00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:37.960]   We actually distributed it as a hypercard stack.
[00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:40.920]   And it was like immediately popular.
[00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:43.320]   We were crashing computers all over the internet.
[00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:44.320]   It's so great.
[00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:47.880]   It's actually big, you know, distribution system going on for what the internet could
[00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:48.880]   do.
[00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:51.240]   And it's, it just, it just kept going from there.
[00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:58.000]   We, we really haven't ever had like a big business plan or we've always just been small
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.200]   and informal and it's still popular and we still get up in the morning and we decide
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:04.360]   what to write about it.
[00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:05.360]   It's pretty fun.
[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:09.960]   It's a real testament though to the quality of your journalism, your integrity that you're
[00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:11.360]   still going strong.
[00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:16.080]   And 27 years later, you've got to take control books imprint and, and, and I love that.
[00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:20.000]   I mean, you know, Twit is in a way modeled over what you're doing.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.720]   It's, it's not, we're not trying to take over the world.
[00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:23.880]   We're not trying to be, you know, CNN.
[00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:26.320]   We just, we just like our little corner of the universe.
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:27.800]   And I think that's fantastic.
[00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:28.800]   Well done.
[00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:30.320]   Congratulations to you both.
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:31.560]   That's great.
[00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:33.720]   Our show today brought to you by Gazelle.
[00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:37.280]   We haven't heard from them in a while, but you know, as we're starting to talk about
[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:43.440]   the new iPhone, Samsung Galaxy S8s coming out this week, might be time to think about
[00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:50.040]   Gazelle, the trusted online marketplace for both selling your old gear and buying your
[00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:57.320]   new gear, trade in your old device for cash or buy a certified pre owned device or do
[00:22:57.320 --> 00:23:02.320]   both for trade ins, go to Gazelle.com, find your device and get an instant quote.
[00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:04.960]   They are locked in, not you.
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:07.200]   They are locked in for 30 days.
[00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:11.360]   That means you have 30 days to get a new device to transfer the data over and then pull the
[00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:12.440]   trigger.
[00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:13.740]   Shipping is free.
[00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:15.600]   Payments are fast.
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:21.120]   You can get paid in by check by PayPal credit or of course, Amazon gift cards.
[00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:24.840]   I just, and all in all, this is a, as painless a way as, as you can do it.
[00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:25.840]   Your offer is free.
[00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:30.360]   Your offer is guaranteed and no wonder people love Gazelle so much.
[00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:37.040]   Two billion plus trade ins, $175 million paid out to customers, but you might wonder,
[00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:39.920]   well, what happens to all those nice devices?
[00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:48.400]   Those lightly used, gently used iPhones, well, or iPads, you can buy as well as Gazelle by
[00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:50.280]   a certified pre owned device.
[00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:57.560]   You've got a great selection, iPhone 5 through 7 plus, they have iPad, Airs, Minis, Pros,
[00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:03.240]   regular iPads, laptops too now, MacBook Airs and MacBook Pros.
[00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:04.640]   Great place to go to get a MacBook.
[00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:10.240]   If you don't want the touch bar, you know, some of these, some of these slightly used
[00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:11.960]   MacBooks are a great deal.
[00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:14.040]   They even have Samsung Galaxy phones.
[00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:16.440]   Every device fully inspected.
[00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:18.440]   They have a 30 point test.
[00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:22.080]   They put all the devices through, they include even cosmetic things like scratch screens.
[00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:26.520]   They make sure that that device is going to be loved by you and it's always backed by
[00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:28.040]   a 30 day return policy.
[00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:31.840]   And of course, while they work with every carrier in the US, they're sold without carrier
[00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:33.760]   contracts and that's nice too.
[00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:38.280]   In fact, if you decide you want to buy there, they have financing at checkout through a
[00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:39.280]   firm.
[00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:41.280]   You just give them basic information.
[00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:42.280]   Approval is instant.
[00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:46.120]   You'll get to pay it off at three, six or 12 months with easy monthly payments through
[00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:48.800]   a bank transfer, a check or a debit card.
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:53.040]   All you have to do is check that box that says financing with a firm at checkout.
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:57.840]   Get the best value on certified pre-owned devices to buy or to sell.
[00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:03.240]   It is Gazelle, G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.com.
[00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:05.240]   Give new life to use electronics.
[00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:06.360]   Let's not put them in the landfill.
[00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:07.800]   Let's bring them to Gazelle.
[00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:10.760]   And if you're buying, especially if you're buying a replacement phone or a phone for a
[00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:14.320]   kid or you just want to save some money, a great place to get your certified pre-owned
[00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:15.320]   devices.
[00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:20.600]   All late model, Gazelle.com, G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.
[00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:22.800]   That's where all my kids' phones come from, Gazelle.
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:24.160]   I thought I could buy.
[00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:28.360]   Last place I'm going to buy a new phone for.
[00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:36.360]   The Audacity to say yes says Marco Arment in a design culture of no.
[00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:45.200]   I thought Marco did a stunning job of really breaking down what happened with Apple.
[00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:51.600]   The 2013 Mac Pro, he gave us a list of the factors that led to its failure was more expensive
[00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:53.560]   than its predecessor.
[00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:57.760]   But it took out features that many customers still needed.
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:03.320]   He says incidentally, parenthetically, the 2016 MacBook Pro has a similar problem.
[00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:07.320]   We know because Apple said it was designed to accommodate precisely two, not one but
[00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:11.400]   two GPUs, each relatively low heat output.
[00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:15.200]   But it turned out, I thought this was quite a Stute CPU.
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:17.320]   Heavy users didn't need the second GPU.
[00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:22.720]   GPU heavy users needed hotter and frankly more recent GPUs.
[00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:27.200]   The only configuration you could get was either over-spect and over-priced for some
[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:30.800]   users or underpowered for other users.
[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:36.800]   Of course, less than a year after its release, it missed the 5K Retina revolution on the
[00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:38.440]   desktop.
[00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:41.920]   And sad to say, and this really bugged me.
[00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:49.360]   It was beaten in CPU performance by the new generation iMacs and Apple never updated it.
[00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:51.680]   So he says the last factor was poor timing.
[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:53.120]   It could have been fixed with regular updates.
[00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:56.440]   But the first two are just major design flaws.
[00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:59.000]   They made the wrong choices.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.280]   He says, I understand why Apple went down that path.
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:05.720]   It's all in the context that led to my favorite line ever spoken in an Apple keynote.
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:08.840]   Can't innovate anymore my...
[00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:10.640]   By Phil Schiller.
[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:11.640]   And a haunt him forever.
[00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:14.120]   He's never going to let live that down.
[00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:15.440]   He said this is...
[00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:19.280]   MacPro is the worst place in the entire Apple product line to drastically remove capabilities
[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:23.000]   and versatilitys and then not update it for over four years.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:31.080]   Overly aggressive minimalism fails most spectacularly when there's no clear consensus among consumers
[00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:32.280]   on what can be removed.
[00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:38.960]   He points out there's four different or more five different categories for MacPro users.
[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:41.600]   And they each had different needs.
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:46.440]   And by cutting out features, they kind of failed everybody.
[00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:48.640]   Video creators need as many CPU users.
[00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:53.760]   Possible audio creators need one fast CPU but fast interfaces.
[00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:59.720]   Photographies need lots of cores, lots of storage, lots of RAM and of course great displays.
[00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:07.400]   More developers, Mac gamers, PC builders all have different requirements.
[00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:13.360]   And so the MacPro, the preceding MacPro, the Cheesegrader Mac could fulfill those needs
[00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:18.600]   with different configurations, not the new MacPro.
[00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:24.360]   So he says if you were going to distill those requirements down to a single word it's versatility.
[00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:30.160]   Exactly what the 2013 MacPro didn't offer.
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:33.280]   This is what I've been going on and on about.
[00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:38.440]   If Apple lets people down it's because they keep trying to predict what makes sense for
[00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:42.840]   people and saying good news, we solved all your problems and anything we took away that
[00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:47.360]   you think you need, don't worry, you're wrong, you don't need this and we're going to prove
[00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:48.360]   you wrong.
[00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:50.200]   And then start to piss people off frankly.
[00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:59.000]   Well, some people are, I don't know if it's a Titanic or Exodus from Apple products but
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.080]   I don't think they've been proven to be right.
[00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:05.720]   I think that you need to have at least one product that says you have the ability to
[00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:08.720]   figure out what this is for for yourself.
[00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:17.520]   And it also leads it to make some, I still think silly choices.
[00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:23.040]   There was John Syracuse, I had a great tweet just a few days ago.
[00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:29.600]   It was a caption simply, I've got a six hour flight and plenty of music to listen to and
[00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:36.040]   then it's a picture of of course an iPhone 7 at the bottom of it and him holding a headphone
[00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:38.680]   jack and I don't have an adapter.
[00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:44.200]   Yeah, it's like, I mean, I won't keep harp.
[00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:48.520]   I still think it's a stupid stupid thing for them to have done, particularly since other
[00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:52.920]   makers that are that are punching at that same weight class have not had a problem adding
[00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:54.800]   features while keeping a headphone jack.
[00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:58.800]   I really think that it's a cultural thing inside engineering that they have to say that,
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:02.640]   look, I know that you've taken great pride in saying, hey, we skate to where the puck
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:07.040]   is going to be, not where the puck is, but you seem to be spending a lot of time just
[00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:10.280]   standing on the ice with the stick in your hand while there seems to be a lot of action
[00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:14.040]   on the other side of the rink where things have happened and you can't just keeping,
[00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:16.640]   continue to have faith that, hey, we know it's better.
[00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:21.800]   We're calling the right shots and everything is falling our way when you have a number
[00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:26.880]   of really public failures in which people are saying, this is not the product for us.
[00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:30.560]   It's now two years later and it's still not the product for us.
[00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:36.640]   And again, I'll just say again, 2016 MacBook Pro and please cut copy paste things I've
[00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:39.160]   been saying for the past three or four months about that.
[00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:43.360]   I just, I hope that they listen to advice like Marcos and say that, look, you have to,
[00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:47.520]   you have to allow people to find their own version of awesome in your products and you
[00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:51.040]   can't do that when you start, start taking away things that they're telling you that
[00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:54.160]   they need our own Patrick De La Hatti puts it very succinctly.
[00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:59.360]   He says, Apple is skating to where they think the puck will be, but we're playing baseball.
[00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:06.840]   Actually, let me read you, let me read you and then we'll continue on to finish the thought
[00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:11.640]   because remember the title of this is the audacity of yes.
[00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:16.200]   And Apple's really been all about since that famous moment when Steve Jobs comes back to
[00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:21.920]   Apple from his, his wandering in the desert with next and says, we've got to learn to
[00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:24.320]   say no, no is the most important word.
[00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:28.760]   He says, I hope that Apple has learned this and is confident enough in its own abilities
[00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:36.000]   and innovation to stare down a minimalist design culture of no and ship a maximum viable
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:42.400]   product at the top of its line that says yes to everything we can throw at it.
[00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:48.840]   Is it really a kind of a redefinition of Apple and its culture, I think?
[00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:49.840]   You agree, Renee?
[00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:51.920]   Yeah, no, it's a really great piece.
[00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:54.080]   Marco has a tendency to knock it out the park every once in a while.
[00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:55.080]   That's definitely one of them.
[00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:59.240]   He might have learned from overcast, which was quite a minimalist podcast app, right?
[00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:02.600]   Well, I think he absolutely did because famously he didn't want a settings button and then
[00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:05.600]   all the hoops he had to jump through in order to not use the settings button was more work
[00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:07.040]   than just having a settings button.
[00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:10.120]   So he added a settings button and everyone learns those sort of lessons.
[00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:13.280]   But with Apple, I mean, the danger of their thing is Steve Jobs used to say, we only have
[00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:17.000]   one, we have one swing every year, but that's all Babe Ruth needs.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.640]   But once in a while, you miss those swings.
[00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:21.760]   And if you're in the habit of hitting them, it's even worse because you start to lose
[00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:22.760]   the conception.
[00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:25.120]   Like if everyone's telling you you're wrong all the time and you succeed anyway, you start
[00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:27.520]   to think, I don't listen to those people because you're telling me I'm wrong all the
[00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:28.520]   time.
[00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:32.080]   And then you have a culture that's very dominated by alpha designers and they have agendas
[00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:33.800]   and they have the chance to slip things in.
[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:37.040]   Like I'm pretty sure that headphone jack has been on their chopping block for years and
[00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:38.680]   they were just never allowed to do it.
[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:41.320]   And finally they say, well, if we do this and they were given the green light and they
[00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:43.920]   wanted to kill that for years, finally they can kill it.
[00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:47.040]   Someone wanted that Mac Pro design for years, finally have a chance to do it.
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:50.080]   And you make a lot of calls on them, you get right and obviously some of them you get
[00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:51.080]   wrong.
[00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:54.520]   But when you make so few products, like Apple makes so few products, every time you get it
[00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:58.040]   wrong, it's a disaster of a scale.
[00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:02.000]   It wouldn't hurt so much.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.760]   If they hadn't had a Mac Pro, that was really pretty much perfect.
[00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:06.760]   Why did they get me that?
[00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:10.960]   So Apple has often left an older product on the market while they've introduced something
[00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:12.120]   new that was controversial.
[00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:15.320]   And I think Andy spoke well to this either it was last week or the week before.
[00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:18.280]   Like just leave that cheese grater on the line and say, this is something new.
[00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:19.280]   We're trying.
[00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:21.640]   We're betting big on OpenCL, but we know the market's not there yet.
[00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:24.320]   So we're going to keep the old cheese grater running.
[00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:25.720]   Update that as much as you need it.
[00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:28.960]   And if you start noticing they're updating the cheese grater more and not updating the
[00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:31.640]   new Mac Pro at all, you can read those tealies.
[00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:32.640]   Yeah.
[00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:33.640]   Yeah.
[00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:35.520]   Tonya, your thoughts?
[00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:37.920]   Used to sell next computers.
[00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:42.920]   I used to sell next computers, which was really fun.
[00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:45.160]   I wish you don't have any lying around still, do you?
[00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:46.160]   Leftovers.
[00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:49.000]   Just a couple t-shirts and a couple stickers.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.960]   Oh man, I would love to have one of those.
[00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:52.640]   I thought it was a great article.
[00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:57.480]   I loved the way Marco laid out some of the different needs of some of the high end users.
[00:33:57.480 --> 00:34:03.160]   I mean, the thing is with Apple and Macintosh and the ethos and the culture that's been
[00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:08.360]   created around it, these pro users, they might not be a very big percentage of the actual
[00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:10.360]   users of Apple products.
[00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:12.120]   But there are most creative folks.
[00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:16.520]   There are photographers, our videographers, the folks who do all the great things with
[00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:17.520]   music.
[00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:21.440]   If they're not using Macs, then something is really wrong.
[00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:26.320]   And I thought it was great that Apple has kind of realized, hey, wait a minute, we have
[00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:30.440]   to make something that maybe is a little bit more of an erector set Macintosh where things
[00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:36.040]   can be customized in a lot of different ways and that they've actually come out in public
[00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:37.840]   and said, hey, we're working on this.
[00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:38.840]   It's really great.
[00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:42.080]   I can't figure out how Apple lost track of that to begin with.
[00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:48.920]   And I fear that it speaks to some deeper problem within the closed confines of Apple that we
[00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:54.920]   don't really know what's going on there because it seems pretty obvious that these super high-end
[00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:59.240]   users have really special needs, but that they're really special to Apple.
[00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:02.840]   Without them, Apple sort of loses an arm.
[00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:05.120]   So I thought it was a great article.
[00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:11.960]   I hope everyone at Apple reads it and takes it to heart and that we can have products
[00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:17.000]   from Apple that are very simple and kind of one-trick ponies that are good for a lot
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.680]   of people who don't have very fancy needs.
[00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:24.200]   But I think Apple could take their design capabilities and all their resources and make
[00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:30.120]   the most amazing machines for these professional people that would let them just do incredible
[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:36.560]   artistic works for us all and also for scientists who need just incredible data-crunching capabilities
[00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:39.360]   and tools for working with that creatively.
[00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:41.240]   So there's so much potential.
[00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:42.560]   And I love the article.
[00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:47.720]   I think it's something that everyone should go read if you haven't already.
[00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:54.160]   It crystallizes things we've been saying with far more words over the last few weeks.
[00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:59.080]   If you do want to play with the next cube, parenthetically, apparently you can go to
[00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:01.520]   the Living Computer Museum in Seattle.
[00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:04.520]   Paul Allen has assembled quite a collection.
[00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:08.480]   This is Steve Jobs' personal Macintosh.
[00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:10.920]   There's was with Paul Allen.
[00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:15.200]   But there's also a next cube, a running next cube you could actually play with.
[00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:22.240]   He's got three Apple ones, including Jobs' personal Apple one that they've got running.
[00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:26.360]   So pretty neat stuff.
[00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:28.520]   Didn't Steve throw that one away?
[00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:29.520]   Yeah.
[00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:31.520]   I think I remember that story.
[00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:36.000]   There was like, you're renovating his office, we're moving to the office and there's just
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.600]   boxes and boxes of what he's doing to be crap on the aisle.
[00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:42.320]   And so I came around and said, "Steve, this is an original Apple one.
[00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:44.120]   Should this be in a museum?"
[00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:45.120]   And he was very anti-museum.
[00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:48.200]   So I'll take this crap out of my office.
[00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:50.440]   I will take Steve Jobs' original Apple one.
[00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:51.440]   Thank you very much.
[00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:52.440]   You're right.
[00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:54.040]   This was back in 1985.
[00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:55.720]   Stop Jobs had been fired.
[00:36:55.720 --> 00:37:02.240]   An engineer, one of the company's first employees, Don Hotmacher, saw the Apple one and grabbed
[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:03.240]   it.
[00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:10.640]   Don passed away last year and his wife has given it to the museum, which is just fantastic.
[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:14.320]   The team, it says, had their suspicions, but a tag inside the metal chassis.
[00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:19.680]   And in fact, it had a chassis at all since these all came just as bare boards suggested
[00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:21.160]   it was more than a rare Apple one.
[00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:23.480]   It was the rare assigned BF.
[00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:32.120]   That's Bill Fernandez, employee number one, five April, 77.
[00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:39.240]   This definitely, according to the experts, was Steve's actual Apple one.
[00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:41.240]   You can see it working.
[00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:42.240]   How long that keyboard?
[00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:43.240]   That's pretty cool.
[00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:46.360]   The living computer museum up in Seattle.
[00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:50.280]   I might have to make a trip up there to see that.
[00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:56.120]   It's nice that Paul Allen's recognizing how important this stuff is and is preserving
[00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:57.120]   it.
[00:37:57.120 --> 00:37:58.280]   Interesting.
[00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:03.920]   We talked last week about NVIDIA making a updated 1080.
[00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:12.640]   It's high-end video card that would work with a Mac Pro.
[00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:16.920]   I think we probably missed the real import of all this.
[00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:22.240]   It isn't because it won't work in a cheese grater Mac, a 2012 cheese grater Mac, but
[00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:26.720]   probably overpowered that Titan XP for a cheese grater Mac.
[00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:27.720]   It's for hacking.
[00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:30.000]   Trying it today, Leo.
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   Are you?
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   I ordered one.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   It arrives today.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   How much was it?
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   It was like $1,000 Canadian.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   I got a TI.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   I didn't get the XC.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   So the XP is $1,200.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   Yeah.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:43.080]   Well, I mean, the Canadian dollars just play a million.
[00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:45.200]   But I brought the cheese grater out of mothballs.
[00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:46.200]   I updated it.
[00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:48.120]   It wouldn't go all the way to CRS.
[00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:49.360]   What's updated to LCAP.
[00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:51.440]   I was actually doing that as the show started.
[00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:52.440]   Oh my god.
[00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:53.440]   Great.
[00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:54.440]   I want to hear how it works.
[00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:56.640]   But after the show, that card's going in and we're going to see what we can do.
[00:38:56.640 --> 00:39:02.680]   But I have to admit that now that upon reflection, somebody observed this in an article, this
[00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:06.480]   probably wasn't intended for Apple Macintosh.
[00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:09.360]   This is a Hackintosh board.
[00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:11.320]   Interesting, huh?
[00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:14.720]   I mean, they can't say that.
[00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:23.320]   Unless it's a board for some cheese grater-like PCI Express Mac Pro that's coming out later
[00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:24.320]   this year.
[00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:25.320]   That's really tested.
[00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:26.320]   Yeah.
[00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:28.640]   It's interesting though, because I don't imagine the Hackintosh market is worth much investment
[00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:29.640]   on its PS4.
[00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:30.640]   Well, yeah.
[00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:33.120]   I mean, of course, it won't work with the trashcan Mac.
[00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:35.520]   So it's kind of a puzzle.
[00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:39.240]   Are there a GPU box or EGPU boxes you could shove it in?
[00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:41.560]   I don't know how those stores are still kind of wanting it.
[00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:44.080]   You could use an EGPU box.
[00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:45.680]   That really wouldn't give you much throughput though.
[00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:48.400]   I don't think that would be the market.
[00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:50.800]   Well, maybe it is the market for it.
[00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:53.600]   Hidden in plain sight.
[00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:55.520]   Yeah, don't you think that's intriguing?
[00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:57.520]   I don't know what that means.
[00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:02.360]   It's just such diversity amongst people who are buying cards like that that I can't imagine
[00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:06.480]   there isn't a market for anything that you'd like to create.
[00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:07.840]   It's so I-- you're right.
[00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:10.320]   I can't think of specifically who this be targeted.
[00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:17.080]   But again, the build your own community is like, I've got my own really weird ideas about
[00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:23.440]   what I need to have a productive day with my little plastic pal can help me do.
[00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:28.040]   And this card seems to be exactly the missing thing in my entire life.
[00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:31.000]   And you may as well make it as some of all nerds.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:39.200]   It's not, it's not up to me as the manufacturer to decide whether something is useful.
[00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:44.360]   My lowly job is to just manufacture it and then let the users decide how to make good
[00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:45.360]   and--
[00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:47.240]   And it isn't to be, you know, complete.
[00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:49.280]   It's not a whole new card.
[00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:51.200]   You have to do drivers, obviously.
[00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:52.800]   That's probably the largest effort.
[00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:54.480]   And then the connectors are slightly different.
[00:40:54.480 --> 00:41:00.800]   The power connectors and the-- not the EPCI connector.
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:02.400]   That's the same, right?
[00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:05.600]   But I think you need a special-- as I remember because I did upgrade--
[00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:06.600]   Find out.
[00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:10.560]   Well, I did upgrade my cheese grater with an update with the best card I could put into
[00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:12.160]   it a couple of years ago.
[00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:14.720]   And it's actually a decent card.
[00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:17.880]   We use it for as a Windows machine to game with.
[00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:18.880]   And it's pretty good.
[00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:19.880]   Yeah.
[00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:21.600]   I'm tempted, but that's a lot of money to spend.
[00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:22.600]   Well, good.
[00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:23.600]   I'll read your article.
[00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:24.600]   For science.
[00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:25.600]   For science.
[00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:26.600]   Thank you for doing it.
[00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:29.000]   I think George's husband is going to do it for us because he's, you know, into that kind
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   of stuff.
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   On it.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   He's a V.R.
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   off of it.
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:34.320]   Well, that's part-- that's one of the things that's missing, right?
[00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:38.120]   It doesn't have-- no Mac has sufficient GPU to run an Oculus Rift.
[00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:41.920]   And the folks at Oculus said, "We're not going to ever do a Mac version.
[00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:42.920]   There's no market.
[00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:43.920]   Former guy at Oculus.
[00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:44.920]   Yeah.
[00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:45.920]   Palmer Lucky, who's now?
[00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:49.120]   Luckily enough, just living on the beach in Germany.
[00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:50.120]   Yeah.
[00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:51.120]   Spending more time with his money.
[00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:52.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:54.120]   He's left to spend more time with his money.
[00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:56.720]   Did they wrote that in the memo because that would be awesome?
[00:41:56.720 --> 00:41:57.720]   That's the famous saying.
[00:41:57.720 --> 00:42:00.120]   It's like, we're inviting you to spend more-- you and your family to spend more time
[00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:01.120]   with your money.
[00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:02.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:03.120]   That would be awesome.
[00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:04.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:08.120]   Apple's working-- oh, let's do the German article, actually.
[00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:09.120]   I'll tell you what.
[00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:10.520]   We're going to take a break.
[00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:11.520]   Come back.
[00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:16.320]   Mark German has synopsized all the rumors for the iPhone.
[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:17.820]   And it's because it's Mark German.
[00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:21.120]   You know, it gets a lot of credibility.
[00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:23.520]   What will we see in September?
[00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:25.520]   We'll talk in just a moment.
[00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:28.320]   But first a word from WordPress.
[00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:31.120]   Love the word, press.
[00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:36.280]   I'm setting up my WordPress blog, leooport.blog, going to move everything over to WordPress.
[00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:41.360]   And I have to say, now I've ran WordPress hosted for years.
[00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:43.680]   And this is my first experience with WordPress.com.
[00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:44.680]   And it is awesome.
[00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:47.240]   And one of the things I love about WordPress.com, you see, it's a little plain.
[00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:50.640]   I still have to-- I have to dress it up a little bit.
[00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:56.200]   Although it was so fun because I totally was able to import all my content going back
[00:42:56.200 --> 00:43:02.120]   to my earliest blogging experiences, I think in 2001, I have to go to the archives to see
[00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:03.120]   that.
[00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:09.720]   But it's really nice when you could take your blog and just move it over, lock stock and
[00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:11.240]   comments.
[00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:16.520]   So WordPress.com is nice because, of course, they're hosting it.
[00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:17.640]   They keep it up to date.
[00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:19.080]   They apply all the patches.
[00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:25.480]   They offer dozens, many, many, many themes of all different kinds.
[00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:27.600]   And you're in a community.
[00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:33.520]   So WordPress.com drives traffic to your site, which is awesome.
[00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:37.280]   If you're a small business, you don't have a website, you kind of miss in the boat, right?
[00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:41.480]   If you're a photographer and people can't see your portfolio online, if you're a restaurant
[00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:45.840]   and people can't book online or see a menu online, if you're a plumber and people can't
[00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:49.480]   just look you up, it's like not having a phone number.
[00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:50.840]   You got to have a website.
[00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:55.320]   And when you create a website at WordPress.com, you can make a big impact on that business.
[00:43:55.320 --> 00:44:00.760]   27% of all websites run on WordPress.
[00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:03.880]   Does that tell you something?
[00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:05.520]   Hundreds of customizable themes.
[00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:08.960]   You pick a template, it's easy to change a template at any time.
[00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:12.680]   Built-in search engine optimization, built-in social sharing, they've got a publicized
[00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:16.080]   feature that automatically shares posts to all your social media networks.
[00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:20.320]   And of course, to the network at WordPress.com, you can even share previously published posts
[00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:24.040]   so you can go back in time, have a throwback Thursday if you want.
[00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:30.320]   And when you build your site on WordPress.com, you're going to get great support 24/7.
[00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:31.320]   Answers to your questions.
[00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:35.400]   There are great developers who, I mean, they're more developers for WordPress than any other
[00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:39.840]   platform who can help you, designers who can help you.
[00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:40.840]   And we're going to help you.
[00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:45.080]   We're going to get you 15% off any new plan purchase right now.
[00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:48.280]   WordPress.com/MacBreak.
[00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:54.680]   And that's why 27% of the websites in the world run on WordPress.
[00:44:54.680 --> 00:44:59.960]   Including many of the biggest publications, WordPress.com/MacBreak.
[00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:04.000]   15% off your brand new website.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:08.480]   I've known these guys since they were in beta.
[00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:13.520]   And I love these guys and have been a fan of WordPress forever.
[00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:17.440]   I believe this is the first time they've ever advertised on podcasts.
[00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:20.880]   They were a little nervous about it, but I got to tell you, I'm just so happy.
[00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:24.000]   Give them a big hug.
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:27.800]   WordPress.com/MacBreak.
[00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:34.960]   And the Inako Chicago Sun Times, ReneeRitchieImore.com, Tanya Inkst, who is briefly sitting
[00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:37.800]   down and not running from tidbits of Hong Kong.
[00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:38.800]   Brief.
[00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:39.800]   She's running.
[00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:40.800]   She's running.
[00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:41.800]   We just can't see it.
[00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:42.800]   It's a treadmill chair.
[00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:45.360]   It's muddy out there.
[00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:49.360]   Mark Gurman, who's now, of course, at Bloomberg.
[00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:51.200]   Big article.
[00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:59.040]   Sources say Apple to unveil three iPhones this fall, including a revamped iPhone with an
[00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:05.360]   all-screen front curved glass and a stainless steel frame, a long side upgrade to the current
[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:06.760]   models.
[00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:07.760]   This is not...
[00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:12.400]   I didn't read anything in here that we hadn't read in other places, but when it's all put
[00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:15.320]   together, I think you get a fairly complete picture.
[00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:20.680]   And of course, one of the things Gurman refers to is this week, the new Samsung Galaxy S8
[00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:22.680]   and S8 Plus come out.
[00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:27.680]   OLED screens, almost edge to edge, certainly edge to edge left and right, almost edge to
[00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:32.200]   edge top to bottom, built-in home button underneath the screen.
[00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:34.240]   A lot of really kind of raising the ante.
[00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:37.680]   And a lot of things that I think everybody expects Apple to do.
[00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:41.120]   Apple's made a deal with Samsung, which is...
[00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:42.960]   Samsung kind of owns OLED screens.
[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:44.760]   They made a deal with Samsung for...
[00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:46.320]   I think the number keeps going up.
[00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:47.920]   The last number I saw, 100 million.
[00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:48.920]   All the rest.
[00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:49.920]   Whatever was left.
[00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:51.080]   Whatever they aren't using.
[00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:53.080]   We'll take it all.
[00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:55.080]   Amazing.
[00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:59.920]   That many, but that's the problem Apple's facing.
[00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:02.960]   Yeah, it's not unique to Apple.
[00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:03.960]   Either Google.
[00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:09.320]   I think last week there was a news item that they have put something like $800 million
[00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:16.120]   investment into, I think it's LG because they need to have some sort of source for any kind
[00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:19.160]   of OLED screen for the next version of their Pixel phone.
[00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:22.880]   And so they're basically saying, what if we were to buy a company essentially that makes
[00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:23.960]   OLED screens?
[00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:26.480]   We don't care what kind of screens they are.
[00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:30.520]   If you have some machine with the letters O, L, E, and D in it, we will give you money
[00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:33.440]   to just say, please sell us screens at the end of the year.
[00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:38.160]   So yeah, this is going to be a problem for a lot of companies.
[00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:44.640]   So Apple kind of broke the mold a little bit with the iPhone 7.
[00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:48.920]   That was the third year in a row, really, pretty much for that design.
[00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:51.880]   So this next one is going to be a big deal.
[00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:53.920]   Although maybe I'm reading this wrong.
[00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:58.800]   I'm reading from this and other rumors that there'll be three phones, two of which will
[00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:01.120]   be very much like the iPhone 7, right?
[00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:02.120]   Yeah.
[00:48:02.120 --> 00:48:05.480]   I mean, there's still a constraint on how many iPhone 8, let's call it iPhone 8 for the sake
[00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:06.480]   of experience.
[00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:09.920]   There's going to be a limit on how many iPhone 8s they can make and the technology in it
[00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:11.400]   is going to be expensive.
[00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:13.760]   And they've shown some elasticity with iPhone pricing.
[00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:17.320]   Like they bumped the price of the plus model up $20 this year and you got a much better
[00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:18.480]   camera for it.
[00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:23.200]   But if there's only one iPhone and it starts $100 more, that's a problem, especially when
[00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:27.680]   people are used to getting iPhones at certain price points and a choice in different sizes.
[00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:30.960]   And this is the opposite of the Mac Pro thing where they're not just, can't innovate anymore,
[00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:32.120]   my ass, here's the iPhone 8.
[00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:34.000]   It's your only choice for iPhones.
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:35.000]   Yeah.
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:40.640]   They are going to keep the iPhone 7 and 7 plus and rev them to iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s plus.
[00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:42.920]   And that also takes a tremendous burden off the iPhone 8.
[00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:44.920]   It does not have to be everything to everybody.
[00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:46.200]   Does not have to be the same price point.
[00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:47.880]   It doesn't have to be as inexpensive.
[00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:49.080]   And also it's a risk.
[00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:51.600]   Apple's betting big on this and there's a lot of new technologies in it.
[00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:54.960]   So if it's not as audacious as they hoped it would be, it's also, you know, you've got
[00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:58.720]   the other two iPhones that are exactly what you thought they were going to be in it.
[00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:00.480]   It de-stressed the situation quite a lot.
[00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:06.520]   We now this may be completely out of left field, but we have seen a number of articles.
[00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:12.640]   CNBC also reported this that Apple's having trouble with this fingerprint sensor, this
[00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:15.480]   embedded fingerprint sensor.
[00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:20.640]   And according to an analyst at Pacific Crest, they put it out in their newsletter.
[00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:25.920]   There may be a delay or they may listen to this.
[00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:31.960]   The anticipated move to a full screen OLED panel, I'm quoting Pacific Crest, in the coming iPhone
[00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:36.840]   8/X eliminates the physical home button, which necessitates a move to a virtual home
[00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:40.520]   button and an optical fingerprint sensing solution to read fingerprints of the OLED
[00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:41.520]   panel.
[00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:46.600]   At this point, says Pacific Crest, we do not believe Apple's optical fingerprint module
[00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:51.200]   provider has firm orders for production.
[00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:54.640]   It's not so a financial analyst, I would just disregard them on mass.
[00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:58.000]   But the basic idea is that Apple always has multiple prototypes, some are audacious and
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:49:59.400]   some are conservative.
[00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:01.560]   And moving the type of, they've already virtualized the home button.
[00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:02.800]   The physical home button is gone.
[00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:04.520]   It's a virtual home button now.
[00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:06.080]   And that part works fine.
[00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:08.440]   It's getting it underneath the screen that's proving a challenge.
[00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:09.680]   Samsung had the same thing.
[00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:11.280]   They wanted, I think it's called Synaptics.
[00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:14.000]   They're the technology they use for their touch ID sensor.
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.640]   They wanted it under the screen in the Galaxy S8 and they just couldn't do it.
[00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:20.120]   The technology wasn't there, so they had to put it on the back instead and they put it
[00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:21.760]   in an actual little camera thing.
[00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:25.240]   Apple's trying the same thing, Apple bought the company that makes their technology authentic
[00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:26.760]   several years ago.
[00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:30.680]   And they're launching six months after Samsung and maybe they will solve this problem.
[00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:34.840]   And the more audacious prototype does in fact try to solve the problem by putting the touch
[00:50:34.840 --> 00:50:36.240]   ID sensor under the screen.
[00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:39.040]   And it remains to be seen how that'll work for accessibility.
[00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:40.320]   Like will it be haptics?
[00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:41.320]   Will it be a little divot?
[00:50:41.320 --> 00:50:43.720]   Like how are they going to solve for where's the home button?
[00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:45.920]   If you're hard or have no vision.
[00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:49.520]   But the more conservative prototypes are on the back because that's where you go if you
[00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:51.600]   can't put it on the front because of all this.
[00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:57.200]   The specific question extrapolated this is kind of a shocking statement that they think
[00:50:57.200 --> 00:51:02.400]   that it's possible there will be no fingerprint sensor on the iPhone 8 and they'll rely on
[00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:04.680]   biometric instead.
[00:51:04.680 --> 00:51:05.680]   What is biometric standard?
[00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:07.680]   I mean, that's the one step.
[00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:09.560]   I'm so happy with it on the GSA.
[00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:11.560]   Everyone's really loving it on the GSA.
[00:51:11.560 --> 00:51:14.040]   It's been a long winter.
[00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:15.080]   We could all use a good laugh.
[00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:16.080]   Thank you financial.
[00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:17.080]   Okay, good.
[00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:21.920]   But everything, Renee really, really had it on point.
[00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:23.400]   You'd be surprised.
[00:51:23.400 --> 00:51:27.680]   My specific knowledge is usually of what goes on behind the scenes.
[00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:33.200]   I was usually like three or four models back, but it's always surprising to me at how late
[00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:35.920]   what might think to be a critical decision is finalized.
[00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:39.560]   Like they will have several different kinds and there are going to be people arguing for
[00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:43.000]   one point or another and things that might have seemed like, well, we're definitely not
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:46.040]   moving forward with a new phone unless it has this feature.
[00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:49.240]   And then they finally decide that, okay, here's everything we will have to do to make this
[00:51:49.240 --> 00:51:51.040]   work and all the risks we're going to take.
[00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:55.680]   And then out of what seems like a very late date, boom, that feature is gone.
[00:51:55.680 --> 00:52:02.480]   My usual line of thinking is that if there's rumors of something being in trouble, it's
[00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:04.280]   not really for the new iPhone.
[00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:10.200]   I usually don't give that a lot of credibility until about June, sometimes even July, because
[00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:14.880]   I feel as though the design is not 100% up in the air, but the idea of are we going to
[00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:19.920]   have a physical, are we going to remove the home button or from the front of the screen?
[00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:24.000]   Are we going to move it or are we going to make it completely embedded inside the glass?
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:28.960]   That I believe that could be finalized as late as June or July.
[00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:33.600]   So yes, I've no doubt that anything they're doing that is that out of the woods is going
[00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:34.760]   to be hard to engineer.
[00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:38.440]   I do think that one of the brilliant, one of the reasons why I love this idea of Apple
[00:52:38.440 --> 00:52:44.600]   having a third phone called the iPhone 8 is because if they say from jump that, by the
[00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:47.600]   way, we're making this in limited quantities.
[00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:49.720]   This is a special edition of the phone.
[00:52:49.720 --> 00:52:53.800]   It sort of sets people up to think that you may not be able to get this or you may have
[00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:55.560]   to wait a few months to get yours.
[00:52:55.560 --> 00:53:00.720]   I think that it's quite okay for people to say, look, you are a maker of phones.
[00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:02.320]   You make the iPhone 7.
[00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:06.280]   You had all of this news out about how you're launching the iPhone 7.
[00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:10.200]   Why can I not buy an iPhone 7 within a week of the date that you have launched this or
[00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:12.000]   within a month of the date that you have launched it?
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:14.800]   Why do I have to get the four gigabyte storage version?
[00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:18.120]   Because that's the only one that anybody has anywhere in North America.
[00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:21.640]   But if you're saying that we have the super special iPhone 8, you're going to wait till
[00:53:21.640 --> 00:53:22.640]   January to get it.
[00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:26.520]   We're going to charge you two or $300 more to get it.
[00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:30.960]   Yeah, then you in some ways it will make you feel even more special for having spent $200
[00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:35.520]   or $300 to say that, I have one of these and you don't have one of these.
[00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:39.840]   You only have the best in class iPhone 7s.
[00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:43.240]   I have the better than best in class one.
[00:53:43.240 --> 00:53:46.640]   John Gruber famously said that one of the iPhone's strengths was affordable luxury and
[00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:48.120]   it was like that coke line.
[00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:51.960]   Everybody drinks the same coke, the president and the janitor drink the same coke.
[00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:56.200]   And now everybody, people in China, everybody has seen the iPhone as a status symbol that
[00:53:56.200 --> 00:53:57.200]   was affordable.
[00:53:57.200 --> 00:54:01.960]   And now you run the risk of an iPhone edition thing where maybe there's resentment towards
[00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:02.960]   their not being affordable.
[00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:05.560]   Yeah, iPhone has never been affordable.
[00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:06.560]   That's not a good argument.
[00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:10.520]   It has always been started off as being crazy expensive.
[00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:14.760]   They had a level of bill that was so high that for other people to meet it, they other
[00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:17.800]   boats sort of had a rise in the water with it.
[00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:22.640]   But now we're talking about a $700, $800 phone that is jockeying against other super
[00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:25.040]   premium $700 and $800 phones.
[00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:30.200]   But in a marketplace where you can get a really good phone for two or $300, and this is not
[00:54:30.200 --> 00:54:35.200]   a cut rate budget phone, but one that if you're okay with having some sort of bezel
[00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:39.080]   on the screen, if you're okay with having a camera that simply takes really good pictures
[00:54:39.080 --> 00:54:42.840]   and low light and cannot take pictures that see through time.
[00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:48.200]   If you're okay with having a oh my God filthy vulgar plastic somewhere on the body instead
[00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:53.400]   of having a make build out of a single block of pure unobtainium, perhaps we can sell you
[00:54:53.400 --> 00:54:54.400]   a phone for 250.
[00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:56.880]   And the cheap ones go for 100 bucks.
[00:54:56.880 --> 00:55:01.200]   So the idea of it's always been a it's I really think this is actually a smart way for apple
[00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:02.200]   to go.
[00:55:02.200 --> 00:55:09.560]   I think they are they are conceptually or even physically able to make an affordable anything.
[00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:14.960]   But I do think that in a world in which it's going to be really hard for me to put one,
[00:55:14.960 --> 00:55:20.560]   two, three, four premium $800 phone side by side and point to one of these and say that
[00:55:20.560 --> 00:55:23.560]   this is objectively better than all the rest.
[00:55:23.560 --> 00:55:26.320]   It's all going to be do like the styling at this point.
[00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:28.800]   I think that for apple to say we're going to do what we do best.
[00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:31.960]   We're going to make phones where we're going to charge you a couple hundred dollars more,
[00:55:31.960 --> 00:55:35.240]   but I keep coming back to the phrase, the Cartier cigarette box.
[00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:41.280]   The really as a beautiful, joyful item that you just enjoy holding in your hand and taking
[00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:46.000]   out of your pocket and looking at and then putting on your putting on your nightstand.
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:51.280]   Most of the most of the reviews of the people who had the Galaxy S8 early are coming out
[00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:52.920]   today or yesterday.
[00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:58.200]   And most of the people who most of the the praise for it isn't anything about the features
[00:55:58.200 --> 00:55:59.200]   it has.
[00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:00.440]   It's oh my God, it looks so beautiful.
[00:56:00.440 --> 00:56:03.680]   It's what I think seen it actually start this is the most beautiful phone I've ever held
[00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:04.680]   in my hand.
[00:56:04.680 --> 00:56:07.280]   So but Apple can totally fight that battle.
[00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:11.120]   It's like, oh my God, you're giving us you're giving us home field advantage.
[00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:14.840]   And you and when you let us start off with an invisible man on second, if you want to
[00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:19.240]   fight us on beautiful styling, we are willing to fight that battle.
[00:56:19.240 --> 00:56:23.240]   So they're their idea of saying we're going to we're going to create another version that's
[00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:27.840]   another leap ahead, not necessarily in features, but we are going to have like again something
[00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:32.120]   like in addition where you will not believe how beautiful an object this is.
[00:56:32.120 --> 00:56:35.400]   That is such a such a strong play for Apple to make.
[00:56:35.400 --> 00:56:38.440]   So I hope that they do go forward with that sort of thing.
[00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:41.840]   I mean, I have to hard pressed.
[00:56:41.840 --> 00:56:46.320]   I mean, this iPhone seven plus in jet black is as close.
[00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:47.320]   I mean, what do you think, Tony?
[00:56:47.320 --> 00:56:51.640]   I mean, isn't that as close to an object of perfection?
[00:56:51.640 --> 00:56:52.640]   It's hard to imagine.
[00:56:52.640 --> 00:56:56.280]   What would you do in a next generation iPhone to make it more beautiful?
[00:56:56.280 --> 00:57:01.480]   I mean, it is Apple's job to convince us that no matter what their phone is, that it's
[00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:02.480]   beautiful.
[00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:06.520]   In fact, it is so much more beautiful than the beautiful one they had a year ago that
[00:57:06.520 --> 00:57:11.800]   it's time to shell out another 500, 600, 700, 800 dollars for this more beautiful thing.
[00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:12.800]   How do you do that?
[00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:15.960]   Well, it's marketing magic, right?
[00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:20.440]   Yeah, the phones have been totally beautiful for like a decade.
[00:57:20.440 --> 00:57:22.480]   It's like Charlie Brown with the football, right?
[00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:26.200]   Every year we go in and we're like, I have a beautiful phone and then Apple announces
[00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:30.080]   their new phones and somehow three hours later, your phone isn't beautiful anymore.
[00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:31.880]   You need a new one.
[00:57:31.880 --> 00:57:33.480]   Oh, dear.
[00:57:33.480 --> 00:57:34.920]   I hope that doesn't happen.
[00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:36.800]   You know, actually it's edge to edge screen.
[00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:37.800]   It's distance charging.
[00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:40.440]   You know, the old bag of tricks Leo, it's two cameras in the front.
[00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:46.400]   I think it's OLED may be critical because you can look at an OLED screen and I mean, I
[00:57:46.400 --> 00:57:49.800]   don't think there's anything wrong with the iPhone seven LED screen at all.
[00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:56.240]   But OLED jumps at you a little bit more and I think people put those side by side.
[00:57:56.240 --> 00:57:58.440]   That might be, I guess that might be sufficient.
[00:57:58.440 --> 00:58:03.600]   Yeah, it'll be more visually awesome in some important way for sure.
[00:58:03.600 --> 00:58:05.760]   It's because that's what Apple does.
[00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:09.360]   I just, I mean, I, it's so team, right?
[00:58:09.360 --> 00:58:15.440]   But this is so close to just a perfect black slab as an object.
[00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:19.760]   It's a perfect, it is just so perfectly black and smooth and shiny.
[00:58:19.760 --> 00:58:20.760]   Yeah.
[00:58:20.760 --> 00:58:22.160]   And this is the jet black.
[00:58:22.160 --> 00:58:25.600]   This is the, you know, the piano black when the shiny one.
[00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:30.560]   And that's my only point of reference, but I just feel like that's just man, that is
[00:58:30.560 --> 00:58:31.560]   really nice.
[00:58:31.560 --> 00:58:32.560]   I bezel.
[00:58:32.560 --> 00:58:33.560]   You know, they're going to delete the bezels.
[00:58:33.560 --> 00:58:35.560]   Oh, that's a mezel.
[00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:36.560]   Yeah.
[00:58:36.560 --> 00:58:41.200]   And I, I would have been the person saying, okay, less bezel who cares or not who cares,
[00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:46.200]   but okay, that's nice, but who cares until I actually held like a true bezel is phone
[00:58:46.200 --> 00:58:47.200]   with a curved screen.
[00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:49.360]   It's like, well, I'm not going to lie to you.
[00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:50.360]   This is, ask me Friday.
[00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:51.360]   Ask me Friday.
[00:58:51.360 --> 00:58:54.880]   It's like a lot of happy chemicals and going through my brain right now.
[00:58:54.880 --> 00:58:55.880]   It is a very sadder.
[00:58:55.880 --> 00:58:56.880]   It's a matter of all.
[00:58:56.880 --> 00:58:57.880]   Friday, I get an eye.
[00:58:57.880 --> 00:59:03.680]   A Samsung Galaxy S8 plus the bigger one, which is the same size as that this, but a 6.2 inch
[00:59:03.680 --> 00:59:07.360]   screen, a considerably larger screen on the same size body.
[00:59:07.360 --> 00:59:08.680]   I'll hold them side by side.
[00:59:08.680 --> 00:59:13.520]   Actually, on the new screensavers, we're going to have the S8, the S8 plus and I will,
[00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:19.320]   I'll hold it up to date as beautiful as the S7 was as beautiful as the Note 7 was.
[00:59:19.320 --> 00:59:24.200]   This is still kind of, it's close to the screen.
[00:59:24.200 --> 00:59:27.080]   I'm not someone who gets excited about, oh, good.
[00:59:27.080 --> 00:59:29.480]   Another phone, another rectangle with rounded corners.
[00:59:29.480 --> 00:59:31.120]   How exciting.
[00:59:31.120 --> 00:59:37.480]   But the jet black one, that was, I think that's the most beautiful phone that Apple has made.
[00:59:37.480 --> 00:59:41.800]   Or excuse me, it's maybe side by side with, I think, the iPhone 4 and 5.
[00:59:41.800 --> 00:59:47.480]   I still like that aluminum frame design, but man, that is a design that is worth waiting
[00:59:47.480 --> 00:59:50.480]   an extra month and a half for if you're on the waitlist for it.
[00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:51.480]   And you may be.
[00:59:51.480 --> 00:59:53.280]   But it's also, it's a personality thing.
[00:59:53.280 --> 00:59:58.000]   So just speaking for me, I don't really like the black phones.
[00:59:58.000 --> 00:59:59.840]   I don't like the slate grade look.
[00:59:59.840 --> 01:00:01.920]   I like the lighter aluminum look.
[01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:03.320]   I like the white.
[01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:04.480]   I don't like rose gold.
[01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:11.520]   Apparently some people do, but it seems like Apple does sort of create an aesthetic and
[01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:13.680]   sort of try to persuade you that you like it.
[01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:17.120]   But I think it's also really important that they have some different colors and different
[01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:18.120]   models.
[01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:20.560]   Oh, I agree 100%.
[01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:23.000]   What show, do you have your phone there, Tanya?
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.200]   Yeah, and I've got this case.
[01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:26.200]   See, that's the thing.
[01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:27.200]   Funny case.
[01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:28.200]   Right.
[01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:29.200]   You put it in a case.
[01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:30.200]   So.
[01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:32.200]   And I put it in a case because it's too slippery.
[01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:33.200]   Yes.
[01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:35.960]   I'm always carrying it around the house going like, hey, Siri this, hey, Siri that.
[01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:36.960]   And we have tile.
[01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:39.280]   So I don't want to drop it.
[01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:42.080]   And I bought a case ahead of time for the Samsung.
[01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:45.400]   But this one I've never put in a case because you can't.
[01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:46.840]   It feels like sacrilege.
[01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:47.840]   Right.
[01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:54.920]   I think that's another vote in favor of having the super wonderful iPhone edition that this
[01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:58.960]   is going to be the one where you just, it seems like sacrilege to put it in a case of
[01:00:58.960 --> 01:00:59.960]   any kind.
[01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:06.520]   Or you need to just sit around looking beautiful and one to use in a kind of a practical way,
[01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:08.320]   you know, like on a trail run.
[01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:09.320]   Oh, yeah.
[01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:12.640]   But see, I don't ever go, I don't ever go out of the house or risk my life for lemon
[01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:13.640]   anyway.
[01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:14.640]   So.
[01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:16.280]   The fake jewelry that you what color?
[01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:17.280]   Galaxy.
[01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:21.280]   I got the orchid, which is I don't know what it's kind of a slightly purple.
[01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:22.280]   Yeah.
[01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:23.280]   I like that one.
[01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:24.280]   Nice.
[01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:28.200]   I just, I mean, you get black, silver or whatever orchid is.
[01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:30.760]   And the only reason I got to work it is because it's not black or so.
[01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:33.720]   You know, it's, you know, it's well, because I have to show people, right?
[01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:34.720]   Yeah.
[01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:39.280]   Apple, Apple's making like such incredibly good like iPads and iPhones and even like,
[01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:42.720]   and some of their MacBooks are really nice.
[01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:46.640]   It's odd, but the thing that I'm looking most looking forward to is them sort of breaking
[01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:51.160]   free of the stultifyingly boring colors.
[01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:53.280]   And hey, look, it's a rounded rectangle.
[01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:59.680]   Like, oh, it's like, it's like, it's like, we're delaying this product for seven weeks
[01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:04.960]   because, you know, we thought it was done, but then we found some scattered grams of joy
[01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:05.960]   in the design.
[01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:11.040]   We just have to make sure we quash all of the joy from this to make sure that it seems
[01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:15.200]   like something that you'll be issued at a job that you are sad to find out you will
[01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:16.720]   definitely have for the rest of your life.
[01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:24.440]   I'll have to see because, but when I look at the pictures, it feels more like a device
[01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:30.000]   and the S7 plus feels like something alien technology might have come up with and left
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.000]   behind by accident.
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.000]   I'm HR.
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.840]   You know, it's just.
[01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:40.200]   This feels like something, you know, kind of a computer, but maybe that's a picture.
[01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:48.560]   So I'll let you know when I hold it in my hot little hands.
[01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:54.680]   You know, so what the theme of this show is Apple's challengers.
[01:02:54.680 --> 01:02:57.320]   You've got Facebook challenging it on augmented reality.
[01:02:57.320 --> 01:03:03.080]   You've got Samsung challenging it on phone design and capability and really, and the
[01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:05.680]   question and they just you get deafening silence from apples.
[01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:08.240]   What are they going to do to respond?
[01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:13.880]   I think the most one of the most important paragraphs in Mark Gurman's article at Bloomberg
[01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:20.800]   is Apple has tested multiple prototypes, including some versions that use curved glass
[01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:22.360]   and stainless steel.
[01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:27.240]   In other words, it's in at this point, it's still too early to know what they're going
[01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:28.240]   to ship.
[01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:29.240]   They're right.
[01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:33.400]   So every year, I mean, there were iPhone four prototypes with NFC in them, which was way
[01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:34.560]   before iPhone four ship.
[01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:39.160]   There was an iPhone four prototype that was big way before the iPhone six ship.
[01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:42.280]   They literally have the money to test everything.
[01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:48.040]   Andy, what you said, like June is when if they're going to manufacture these in quantity
[01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:54.840]   for a September or maybe October ship date, when do they have to start manufacturing?
[01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:57.520]   I feel like it's between two and three months.
[01:03:57.520 --> 01:04:02.760]   I feel like they have to have this as we knock the drop deadline is two or three months before
[01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:05.040]   they intend to at least announce.
[01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:07.640]   So that would be July for an October ship date.
[01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:10.480]   Well, and they have a lot of wiggle room.
[01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:14.600]   They have a lot of wiggle room because historically, sometimes it's kind of early September and
[01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:17.560]   sometimes it's really moving into late October.
[01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:23.320]   Nobody would really get to hung up on them if it was anywhere in that window.
[01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:27.400]   And I'm sure there are project managers at Apple right now with these huge, you know,
[01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:32.680]   spreadsheets or whatever they're using with like plan A, plan B, plan C, plan K.
[01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:37.360]   You know, what if, what if, what if they'll start sorting it out and sooner or later if
[01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:41.160]   they haven't sorted it out, some, you know, big grown up with a big stick is going to
[01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:46.760]   come in and say, okay, folks, you know, June 15th, nobody leaves, nobody eats until we
[01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:48.080]   have a plan that we can do.
[01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:51.480]   I do wonder though, and everyone's got to be terrified of that because you know the big
[01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:53.720]   stick is made out of one stick of milled aluminum.
[01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:57.880]   That's kind of the seven S and the seven S plus will ship.
[01:04:57.880 --> 01:04:59.840]   So that gives them some wiggle room.
[01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:06.880]   They have time, but, but do you think Apple now at this point is kind of at least somewhat
[01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:11.400]   fatalistic about the fact, well, you know, look, we couldn't get the air pods out on time.
[01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:15.400]   We couldn't, are they kind of just saying, well, it'll be constrained supply.
[01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:20.680]   We know we won't be able to ship as many phones as we could sell until January.
[01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:23.280]   They just kind of like, that's the way it is.
[01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:24.280]   They were not happy about any of that.
[01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:28.760]   I believe they made internal changes that have, you know, that's why they say that, but
[01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:30.680]   it keeps freaking happening.
[01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:35.120]   So I mean, that's why they've got to execute if they want to stay at the top of the heap,
[01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:36.120]   they've got to execute.
[01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:37.120]   They've got to get people.
[01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:40.800]   Don't you think they said that before and before and before and it still happens.
[01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:45.160]   Sometimes we say, well, as an Apple just waiting it a little bit better and they did
[01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:48.160]   that with the like they changed the tip of the pencil at the last minute because it felt
[01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:50.000]   a little bit better and that resulted in delay.
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.800]   Do we want them to get it out on time or do we want them to take their time and get it
[01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:53.800]   better?
[01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:55.880]   And there's people internally clashing on that issue too.
[01:05:55.880 --> 01:05:59.160]   It's embarrassing when it happens in public, but you know, it's the same.
[01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:01.720]   We in this same show have argued both sides of that thing.
[01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:04.560]   So I can only imagine what it's like when you're shipping the product.
[01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:05.920]   Yeah, I mean, it's true.
[01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:11.680]   It's true that by delaying the the air pods and making them so constrained, they, I'm sure
[01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:15.280]   they hate that because that is literally they're leaving money on the table.
[01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:19.280]   There is whenever one of the simple rules of business is that when someone is approaching
[01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:23.400]   you and giving you with their money in the hand, the first thing you do is take the money
[01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:26.600]   out of that hand, put a product in their hand and get them out the door before they think
[01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:27.840]   twice about it.
[01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:30.800]   So there's definitely there's there's nobody thinking that this is this is still a third
[01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:33.720]   rail and they're still really embarrassed about it.
[01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:40.200]   However, there we I do think that it's time to get rid of the culture that says that if
[01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:44.880]   this product is shipping on October 3rd, you have to have it by October 8th.
[01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:49.120]   It's okay for some it's okay to have to wait a couple months to get something.
[01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:53.880]   This is not this is not the technology that will the was the new version of the Apple
[01:06:53.880 --> 01:07:00.560]   Watch that can help diabetics observe their their their blood sugar, then it will be critical
[01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:02.920]   for people to have it as early as possible.
[01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:06.280]   But when it's something that oh, it's a new case design, the camera is a little bit better
[01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:10.080]   and has a little bit more application RAM, that it's okay to wait a couple months for.
[01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:14.960]   But the other thing is it is it is the difference between playing in the NFL and just playing
[01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:17.560]   a flag football league after work.
[01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:21.840]   It's like the big companies they are able to not only ship on time, but also make sure
[01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:24.240]   that they shipping in quantity on time.
[01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:30.960]   So this is something that Apple continues to have to solve this problem to continue to
[01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:34.040]   prove that they are playing in the NFL.
[01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:39.080]   It's interesting you should mention diabetes because CNBC had the story that Apple has
[01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:43.560]   a secret team working on the whole.
[01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:50.440]   For treating diabetes, a group of biomedical engineers looking for non prick sensors,
[01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:55.960]   non invasive sensors that can do continuous blood sugar monitoring course, type two diabetes
[01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:57.360]   is epidemic in this country.
[01:07:57.360 --> 01:07:58.360]   I have it.
[01:07:58.360 --> 01:08:02.320]   A lot of people have it because we've been eating so poorly.
[01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:09.120]   Thanks to revised dietary recommendations that turned out to be wrong from some years
[01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:10.680]   ago.
[01:08:10.680 --> 01:08:12.720]   And so I think this is a great business.
[01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:19.520]   Apparently this was an initiative was according to CNBC envisioned by Steve Jobs.
[01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:21.200]   He wanted to do this.
[01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:25.960]   CNBC quotes three people familiar with the matter.
[01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:29.720]   The initiative is far enough along with Apple has been conducting feasibility trials at clinical
[01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:35.400]   sites across the Bay Area and has hired consultants to help it figure out the regulatory pathways.
[01:08:35.400 --> 01:08:39.120]   Of course, you would have to have FDA approval for something like this if it were going to
[01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:40.680]   be used by physicians.
[01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:43.920]   The efforts have been going on for at least five years.
[01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:47.680]   Jobs envisioned wearable devices like smart watches being used in modern important vital
[01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:51.800]   science oxygen levels, heart rate and blood glucose.
[01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:58.640]   They acquired a company in 2010 called Core, which does something like this in their Core
[01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:03.400]   CEO Bob Messerschmitt is now on the Apple Watch team.
[01:09:03.400 --> 01:09:04.400]   Would make sense.
[01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:09.080]   You know, this would I'll tell you what that one thing alone would sell millions of
[01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:10.080]   Apple watches.
[01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:12.760]   No matter what the price.
[01:09:12.760 --> 01:09:18.560]   That opens the when I read that it does open now some ethical questions.
[01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:22.080]   If you have some technology that could this this is one of the holy truly one of the holy
[01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:25.960]   grill technologies for management of diabetes.
[01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:30.360]   And it's it's been pursued by a lot of different companies by a lot of different industries
[01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:31.880]   for a lot of years.
[01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:38.560]   So if they were to crack this and is it ethical would it be ethical for Apple to hold a patent
[01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:44.520]   on this technology and limit it to solely to Apple products.
[01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:51.040]   It feels a little bit like saying that we have a we have a cure for these three types
[01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:55.800]   of cancer, but you can only order the drug through an Apple TV.
[01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:56.800]   Wow.
[01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:57.800]   Yeah.
[01:09:57.800 --> 01:10:00.120]   Nobody would do that that you couldn't do that.
[01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:01.120]   Yeah, I took it.
[01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:03.560]   Like this whole article was weird to me because I'm pretty sure this has been reported on
[01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:05.120]   since before the Apple Watch came out.
[01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:09.920]   It is like the Josh Lyman secret plan to fight inflation that you no longer support.
[01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:13.000]   It's just entirely not like it's it's so public knowledge.
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:16.240]   And they had an article a while ago saying that the FDA approval process was why Jeff
[01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:19.440]   Williams was in charge of health devices, not just Apple watch because they'd have to
[01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:20.760]   spin off other devices.
[01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:24.720]   If the regulatory process became so encumbered that they couldn't ship Apple watch in a regular
[01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:28.200]   basis, basically you'd have the consumer Apple watch and then you'd have specialty health
[01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:32.080]   products that could ship it a slower schedule because it requires so much approval.
[01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:35.960]   I think the biggest takeaway here is that Apple is getting closer, but close can be years
[01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:36.960]   still.
[01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:39.320]   And I think the other thing is that we've seen with like fingerprints, they all were
[01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:42.600]   terrible and then touch ID came out and now on all phones are pretty good.
[01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:44.440]   And a lot of people are trying to crack this technology.
[01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:47.640]   And I think one of them, whether it's Apple or someone else will crack it and then everyone
[01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:49.680]   else will quickly crack their versions of it as well.
[01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:51.440]   That tends to be what I think we see in technology.
[01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:54.960]   So I don't think it'll be bottled up at Apple at all, but I think it would be super great
[01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:58.760]   for everyone who wants to wear an item like this on their wrist.
[01:10:58.760 --> 01:10:59.760]   Yeah.
[01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:02.040]   I read the article and I immediately thought, well, wait.
[01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:03.760]   How many people have diabetes?
[01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:08.400]   And I went and looked on the American Diabetes Association website and I had no idea.
[01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:14.800]   It's one in 10 Americans, folks over 65, 25% approximately have this condition.
[01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:16.040]   So holy wow.
[01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:19.520]   I mean, that is a lot of people who could really benefit from this.
[01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:21.280]   And that's just the people who have diabetes.
[01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:23.160]   I immediately started to think about athletes.
[01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:27.480]   I'm thinking, whoa, I wonder if you had a sports watch that did this, if you could actually
[01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:33.480]   predict or get some feedback about when you need to start eating a gel or having some
[01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:34.480]   kind of a snack.
[01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:39.920]   So I think there's going to be not just medically for people with diabetes, but in the whole
[01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:44.200]   sports watch industry, there could be a lot of interest in a technology like this.
[01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:45.760]   So it's going to be really interesting.
[01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:50.640]   Would you be interested, for instance, in a VO2 max monitor that could measure your oxygen
[01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:51.640]   blood oxygen?
[01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:52.640]   Oh, totally.
[01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:53.640]   Yeah.
[01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:55.080]   Every runner once wanted those.
[01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:56.080]   Right.
[01:11:56.080 --> 01:11:58.320]   So heart rate's really important.
[01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:02.880]   I think there are VO2 max sensors in ear sensors and other ways to measure that.
[01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:04.480]   I don't know how accurate they are.
[01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:05.880]   Yeah, there may be.
[01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:06.880]   They're not.
[01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:07.880]   It's not a mainstream thing.
[01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:11.640]   They have mainstream heart rate sensors, but either they're not very good or they're
[01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:12.640]   kind of awkward.
[01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:14.600]   So people use them, but they don't love them.
[01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:19.360]   Apple watches is the best non, you know, breastbone heart rate sensor I've used.
[01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:21.240]   I mean, it's very accurate.
[01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:26.800]   I think that kind of like the serious athletes aren't necessarily.
[01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:28.360]   They need better than that.
[01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:29.360]   Interesting.
[01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:32.200]   Yeah, it's kind of more like it's good.
[01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:34.000]   It's just they can work on it.
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:35.000]   Really?
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:36.000]   You don't think so.
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:37.000]   That's interesting.
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:38.000]   It's not accurate enough.
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.320]   For me, I don't I don't wear the Apple watch tight enough.
[01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:42.560]   It just it doesn't it doesn't really get it.
[01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:43.560]   Yeah.
[01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:44.560]   Yeah.
[01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:45.560]   Some people have a garment for the GPS.
[01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:49.440]   I mean, some people would really escalate every every independent aspect of their training.
[01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:50.440]   Right.
[01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:51.440]   Yeah.
[01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:53.080]   And if you're serious, but you have like a chest strap, right?
[01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:54.080]   That goes around.
[01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:55.920]   It's like really it gets every every.
[01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:56.920]   Yeah.
[01:12:56.920 --> 01:12:57.920]   Those are the most accurate, obviously.
[01:12:57.920 --> 01:12:58.920]   Yeah.
[01:12:58.920 --> 01:12:59.920]   Yeah.
[01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:03.400]   But this is this is just the ability to just keep track of all kinds of data just on a
[01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:05.200]   continuous basis.
[01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:09.480]   Blood oxygen level, the first thing that comes to mind is of course, people who are training,
[01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:14.560]   but also if you have asthma, if you have if you have history of heart disease, this
[01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:18.640]   is this is the ability to not only give you a warning saying that, okay, you really want
[01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:23.200]   to slow down right now because I'm not seeing what I'm liking or the ability to simply
[01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:28.640]   once you once you have traded the amount of paperwork you need with your doctor to say,
[01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:32.520]   I'm going to give you access to my health records that I'm that I've been storing in
[01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:36.800]   my watch to say that not only not only can I say, well, geez, I was feeling kind of tired
[01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:41.360]   after I was lifting some heavy boxes, but also saying here is you can actually just pull
[01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:42.360]   out your your iPhone.
[01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:48.360]   Did to didn't here's the graph of blood oxygen levels for the past three weeks say, yeah,
[01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:53.320]   why don't you call why should call your your wife or husband and have make help tell them
[01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:56.080]   you're not going to be home tonight to have him bring some pachamas.
[01:13:56.080 --> 01:14:00.480]   We're definitely going to want to keep you under observation for the next 36 hours.
[01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:06.040]   It's this sort of incidental data collecting that again, not not connected to I don't
[01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:07.040]   like what my phone is saying.
[01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:08.680]   I'm going to the emergency room right now.
[01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:12.160]   That would be that would be a disaster for health care, but the ability when your doctor
[01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:17.200]   has a question to be able to answer it with a chart on your phone that will not it's not
[01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:18.200]   just saving lives.
[01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:26.520]   It's like alerting a alerting somebody to his condition before their lives need to be
[01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:27.520]   saved.
[01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:33.280]   When a stent can solve a problem, but before would have been, no, you had a you had a sort
[01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:38.520]   of heart attack where all we can do is keep you from.
[01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:42.960]   You know, it's their their their coronary events that boards there are no solutions,
[01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:46.880]   and it's horrible to know that to think that at some time during this person's medical
[01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:52.880]   history, it could have been detected and headed off many years in advance.
[01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:58.800]   That's the sort of stuff that if Apple were to do that, I love Apple is absolutely I believe
[01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:05.280]   that Apple is absolutely sincere about their their corporate mandate to improve lives through
[01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:06.280]   technology.
[01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:09.600]   And I still think that health is what there is where they're really, really spike in the
[01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:10.680]   ball there.
[01:15:10.680 --> 01:15:15.320]   Just health kit, just research kit, those alone are really, really great things.
[01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:20.720]   And I'm sure that they're not satisfied with the Apple watch as a style device and as
[01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:24.440]   a sports sports, sports training device.
[01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:30.640]   I really think that that is that is their Mac, right 1.0 of the idea for this watch.
[01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:31.920]   They really want it to be.
[01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:35.520]   This is something that you put on your wrist and it will be collecting information that
[01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:40.200]   belongs to you, but will help you in a myriad of different ways and once they have the ability
[01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:45.560]   to just through shining light through your skin to be able to figure out that here is
[01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:48.800]   some data that is going to be very important in three years time.
[01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:51.240]   That's so in line with their mandate.
[01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:54.920]   There was a great story in the daily mirror, I think in the UK, it was terrifying, but
[01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:58.800]   terrific at the same time where someone had an accident in the vehicle spun around and
[01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:01.240]   their, I guess their phone flew away and they couldn't reach anything, but they held
[01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:05.160]   down the button on their Apple watch and it automatically called 911 for them.
[01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:08.240]   And that's a situation where you're literally helpless and you have a device on your wrist
[01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:10.960]   and they can get you emergency treatment and save your life.
[01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:15.040]   And I think those kinds of features and try to publicize them as much as possible.
[01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:17.920]   Those are the kinds of features that wearable technologies excel at because your phone won't
[01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:18.920]   go flying away.
[01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:19.920]   You won't drop it.
[01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:20.920]   It won't be under your seat.
[01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:21.920]   It won't be in your pocket.
[01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:23.880]   It's right there and you can get to it.
[01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:29.560]   Apple, yeah, to watch, you could use the emergency button right on the wrist.
[01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:31.240]   Yeah, right.
[01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:36.320]   Apple has apparently is still working on a self-driving car or maybe they applied for
[01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:41.360]   this a while ago, but they've, they now have permission from the California Department
[01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:50.040]   of Motor Vehicles to test five, I'm sorry, three Lexus RX 540 H SUVs, six drivers approved
[01:16:50.040 --> 01:16:53.680]   for testing autonomous vehicles.
[01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:55.720]   Like, ever.
[01:16:55.720 --> 01:17:00.720]   Chinese ride hailing service DD Chu Xing, which Apple is a big investor, they put a
[01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:05.280]   billion dollars into it recently set up a self-driving car lab near Apple's headquarters.
[01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:08.080]   So maybe this is not something Apple's doing.
[01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:09.560]   Maybe it's DD or I don't know.
[01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:13.040]   Even if they're working on software, they'll need to test it on the road.
[01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:14.040]   Yeah.
[01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:15.040]   Right.
[01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:18.960]   Also, Google's next generation self-driving cars are Lexus SUVs.
[01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:23.080]   Lexus has also announced, I think, that they're going to have their own self.
[01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:27.080]   They're going to, not autonomous, but a lot of self-driving features by 2020.
[01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:30.280]   So it could be that they just tap, this happens to be a platform that has all the sensors
[01:17:30.280 --> 01:17:31.280]   they need.
[01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:35.200]   It's a good platform to simply test software on because they don't have to really,
[01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:39.920]   excuse me, because they don't have to, they don't have to turn it into a time traveling
[01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:43.080]   DeLorean in order to actually test off the software.
[01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:45.960]   I want to DeLorean now.
[01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:47.960]   Thank you, Andy.
[01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:48.960]   I do too.
[01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:50.960]   I kind of have a DeLorean.
[01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:52.520]   I have a Tesla, a lot of X.
[01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:54.520]   That's about as close to it.
[01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:55.520]   It's a DeLorean.
[01:17:55.520 --> 01:17:56.520]   It's a deep mouth.
[01:17:56.520 --> 01:18:02.040]   I frequently say when I put people in it, we're going, we don't need any roads.
[01:18:02.040 --> 01:18:05.360]   Why is it, it's got that really huge screen dead center.
[01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:08.760]   I know it's facing the wrong way, but why is it on Easter egg that will like just turn
[01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:10.560]   that into a flux capacitor stream.
[01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:13.520]   I'm sure it's a really good thing.
[01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:17.440]   No, that's my, that's my only lack of faith in Elon Musk that he does.
[01:18:17.440 --> 01:18:19.440]   That was not like in version 1.0.
[01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:21.600]   He has never in his life on any time.
[01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:23.680]   Not enough of a sense of humor.
[01:18:23.680 --> 01:18:26.120]   Tree huggers unite.
[01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:31.520]   Apple is apparently buying all the good trees.
[01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:33.280]   All that handles trees.
[01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:35.720]   I just Google have anything else for this.
[01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:38.120]   Now they're building literally a walled garden.
[01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:43.280]   Hey, apparently in San Francisco, they're building a transit center, which has a four
[01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:49.360]   and a half acre green roof that's going to feature 469 trees.
[01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:53.160]   But according to the San Francisco Chronicle, quote, buying trees is a surprisingly cutthroat
[01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:57.680]   business and it's been especially challenging to locate desirable specimens because Apple
[01:18:57.680 --> 01:19:05.280]   has been buying up 3000 trees for its new Cooper, Tina headquarters when the folks building
[01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:07.640]   the transit center found a tree they liked.
[01:19:07.640 --> 01:19:12.400]   They tag it with a locking yellow tag so that nobody else like Apple could get it.
[01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:16.040]   Eventually, all the tag trees were moved to a nursery in Sanal where the Transbay team
[01:19:16.040 --> 01:19:17.040]   leased four acres.
[01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:18.040]   They got all the good leaves.
[01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:19.040]   They're fighting.
[01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:20.040]   They're fighting.
[01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:24.400]   Like manned flash wars all over again.
[01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:31.440]   Well, you know, you got a big campus and you tell you what, we'll trade you eight trees
[01:19:31.440 --> 01:19:33.480]   for 10,000 OLED screens.
[01:19:33.480 --> 01:19:36.600]   Eight perch for three elm.
[01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:39.840]   Apple is opening up to workers later this month.
[01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:46.320]   And apparently there's 3.4 million square feet of offices and 3.5 million square feet
[01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:47.320]   of parking.
[01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:50.240]   I'll fill the supercars.
[01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:54.120]   11,000 parking spots for 14,000 people.
[01:19:54.120 --> 01:19:56.960]   So somebody's going to have to carpool.
[01:19:56.960 --> 01:19:58.440]   They got the bikes.
[01:19:58.440 --> 01:20:00.720]   Or you just can't all work at once.
[01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:03.200]   So 28, shift workers.
[01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:04.200]   Yeah.
[01:20:04.200 --> 01:20:06.800]   I mean, we just find the Chinese factories.
[01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:07.800]   Actually a good percentage.
[01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:11.760]   I didn't know this, but a good percentage of Apple's staff uses alternate transportation,
[01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:14.400]   including vans and carpools, 28%.
[01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:18.040]   So you know, you don't really need all those parking spaces.
[01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:21.720]   That's all for the journalists who are going to be arriving in September for the first.
[01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:25.600]   No, I think that's all for like the senior executives with a $300,000 car.
[01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:27.720]   You know, we're going to park across three spaces.
[01:20:27.720 --> 01:20:28.720]   They don't get things.
[01:20:28.720 --> 01:20:30.040]   That was probably part of their thinking.
[01:20:30.040 --> 01:20:31.600]   And there's nine cars in storage.
[01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:33.200]   I mean, come on, how many cars?
[01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:34.200]   Apple is it?
[01:20:34.200 --> 01:20:40.440]   I did read someone who was writing about, maybe they're just being a Debbie Downer.
[01:20:40.440 --> 01:20:44.880]   But they're saying, it's nice that they keep proclaiming that this is going to be an energy
[01:20:44.880 --> 01:20:45.880]   neutral building.
[01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:47.920]   It's one of the greatest buildings ever.
[01:20:47.920 --> 01:20:54.680]   But they're kind of faulting Apple on having so many parking spaces that to be one of the
[01:20:54.680 --> 01:20:58.400]   next generation sort of green ideas they could have done is saying that we're going
[01:20:58.400 --> 01:21:03.400]   to specifically have fewer parking spaces that we would have put in this building if
[01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:09.680]   we had built it 10 years ago as a way of sort of forcing us to create other solutions for
[01:21:09.680 --> 01:21:17.680]   ride sharing to increase a public transportation infrastructure to basically make it keep fewer
[01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:22.960]   of our employees commuting in a gas burning vehicle every single day, which is an interesting
[01:21:22.960 --> 01:21:23.960]   way of thinking about it.
[01:21:23.960 --> 01:21:27.360]   It just goes to show that green has so many facets to it.
[01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:30.640]   And there's always going to be a way that as good as you're doing, there's always going
[01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:32.640]   to be a way to improve it on some level.
[01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:33.640]   Apple.
[01:21:33.640 --> 01:21:36.120]   You'll think every strip mall there with two teratorn down for parking space and they'd
[01:21:36.120 --> 01:21:39.600]   rent out to Apple employees for 10 bucks a head.
[01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:44.680]   Apple told Bloomberg that 96% of its energy comes from renewable waste resources, wind
[01:21:44.680 --> 01:21:51.320]   and solar, and they're trying hard to get all of their suppliers to do the same.
[01:21:51.320 --> 01:21:57.240]   There are a total of seven Apple suppliers now that say we use solely renewable energy
[01:21:57.240 --> 01:22:01.840]   to manufacture components for iPhones and so forth.
[01:22:01.840 --> 01:22:03.640]   That's pretty remarkable.
[01:22:03.640 --> 01:22:08.120]   Their goal is to use only renewable energy throughout the world.
[01:22:08.120 --> 01:22:12.520]   They already do so in 24 countries, including the US.
[01:22:12.520 --> 01:22:16.640]   The Apple and its suppliers expect to generate over 2.5 billion kilowatt hours per year of
[01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:19.360]   clean energy by the end of next year.
[01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:23.120]   And of course, that's why there's solar panels all over the new headquarters.
[01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:29.200]   In fact, so many, they'll generate excess power and they plan to sell it, which is another
[01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:30.200]   little profit center.
[01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:32.880]   The another billion dollar business for Apple.
[01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:34.240]   Pretty soon it's real money.
[01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:37.240]   We have that going on right here at Tinbits as well.
[01:22:37.240 --> 01:22:40.840]   Adam and I in our very own backyard have gone net zero.
[01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:42.760]   We have three huge solar panels.
[01:22:42.760 --> 01:22:48.640]   We drive one conventional car and we have an electric leaf for other cars.
[01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:53.400]   So we literally can get up in the morning, get in our car and drive on photons.
[01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:54.400]   Isn't that nice?
[01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:56.600]   And we can even sell extra back to the grid if we have any.
[01:22:56.600 --> 01:22:57.600]   It's pretty fun.
[01:22:57.600 --> 01:22:58.600]   We've been doing the same thing.
[01:22:58.600 --> 01:23:01.760]   It's happening with Apple, but it's happening all over.
[01:23:01.760 --> 01:23:04.480]   We have 30 panels on our roof.
[01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:05.920]   Tesla in the garage.
[01:23:05.920 --> 01:23:12.000]   Lisa still has a what Tesla fans call an ice car, an internal combustion engine car.
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:15.520]   But she's going to you like the leaf because she wants to buy the new leaf when our lease
[01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:16.520]   runs out.
[01:23:16.520 --> 01:23:18.920]   I have driven the Tesla and I have driven a leaf.
[01:23:18.920 --> 01:23:22.680]   I would say that the Tesla is so fun to drive.
[01:23:22.680 --> 01:23:26.680]   The leaf is also very fun to drive, but the cost difference between the two is kind of
[01:23:26.680 --> 01:23:28.480]   the difference of how fun they are to drive.
[01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:32.120]   That's why Lisa's buying a leaf.
[01:23:32.120 --> 01:23:34.480]   Yeah, it's a great car.
[01:23:34.480 --> 01:23:36.560]   It's very seems to be quite reliable.
[01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:39.440]   It's incredibly peppy on the hills.
[01:23:39.440 --> 01:23:45.720]   And it's just so fun to be like waiting in the high school pickup line for your kid,
[01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:46.720]   right?
[01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:51.280]   And all the other cars are these huge SUVs and they're idling and all this.
[01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:57.760]   And your car, you can play the radio and you can have the heater going and you're using
[01:23:57.760 --> 01:24:00.360]   just this tiny little durable of electricity.
[01:24:00.360 --> 01:24:02.480]   It doesn't smell, it doesn't make noise.
[01:24:02.480 --> 01:24:04.200]   We've really enjoyed this car.
[01:24:04.200 --> 01:24:11.920]   I have to say, when I pick up at school, opening the gull wing doors is always a big shuttle.
[01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:15.800]   It's a little more of a scene.
[01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:18.840]   And Michael always knows which car to get into.
[01:24:18.840 --> 01:24:25.360]   But Leo, I have to say that having the dry ice pods that's overkill, I think that's
[01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:26.920]   less impressive than ostentatious.
[01:24:26.920 --> 01:24:33.320]   I like to play really loud, you know, the final countdown as I open the data.
[01:24:33.320 --> 01:24:34.320]   Yeah.
[01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:39.360]   Let's take a break and we will get to your picks.
[01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:42.600]   I don't know if they warned you, Tanya, but we'll be looking for a pick.
[01:24:42.600 --> 01:24:45.120]   It can be a take control book, anything you want.
[01:24:45.120 --> 01:24:46.680]   I've got a pick going.
[01:24:46.680 --> 01:24:47.680]   Nice.
[01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:48.680]   So do I.
[01:24:48.680 --> 01:24:49.680]   I have a good one.
[01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:52.960]   But first a word from the tracker.
[01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:53.960]   A coin side.
[01:24:53.960 --> 01:24:54.960]   I have my tracker.
[01:24:54.960 --> 01:24:56.200]   Yeah, here it is right here.
[01:24:56.200 --> 01:24:57.200]   A coin side.
[01:24:57.200 --> 01:24:58.880]   I have actually trackers all over the place.
[01:24:58.880 --> 01:25:03.840]   But my favorite place to keep my trackers on my keys and then I lock my chain, my keys
[01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:05.280]   to my briefcase.
[01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:08.040]   That way it does double duty.
[01:25:08.040 --> 01:25:09.880]   I probably shouldn't tell you that in an ad for the tracker.
[01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:12.040]   No, you should get one for each.
[01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:13.560]   But but that you can do that.
[01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:15.000]   In fact, the tracker is so cool.
[01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:19.600]   It's a little quarter sized, anodized aluminum, very light, replaceable battery.
[01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:23.240]   So you don't have to throw it out when the battery dies like the other guys.
[01:25:23.240 --> 01:25:25.040]   This is awesome.
[01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:28.920]   And you know, the worst thing is when you lose your keys, you don't notice it till you're
[01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:31.440]   late for work or you're almost late.
[01:25:31.440 --> 01:25:33.040]   And then you're going, where are they?
[01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:34.040]   Where are they?
[01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:36.120]   It's the stress it adds to your life with a tracker.
[01:25:36.120 --> 01:25:38.720]   You never have to worry about losing things.
[01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:44.760]   You can locate not only keys, but wallets, bags, computers, bicycles in seconds.
[01:25:44.760 --> 01:25:46.280]   The tracker pairs to your phone.
[01:25:46.280 --> 01:25:49.240]   You can track up to 10 devices at once in the tracker app.
[01:25:49.240 --> 01:25:50.280]   They have family sharing.
[01:25:50.280 --> 01:25:54.600]   So you can have several phones tracking the same tracker, Bravo.
[01:25:54.600 --> 01:25:55.600]   This is nice.
[01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:58.400]   I track Michael's backpack and he does two on his phone.
[01:25:58.400 --> 01:26:00.320]   But that way he can't say, I don't know where my backpack is.
[01:26:00.320 --> 01:26:01.960]   I can say, I know where it is.
[01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:03.160]   Shows up right on the map.
[01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:07.640]   And you know, I love the trackers GPS crowdsourced network.
[01:26:07.640 --> 01:26:09.440]   Now the tracker itself is not a GPS device.
[01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:10.840]   It's Bluetooth LA.
[01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:12.440]   Your phone has the GPS.
[01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:15.160]   But if you lose your device and somebody takes it somewhere else, you know, it's out
[01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:17.640]   of the range because it's only about a hundred foot range.
[01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:23.320]   Don't worry because there are four and a half million trackers out there all over the world.
[01:26:23.320 --> 01:26:27.680]   And whenever anybody running the tracker app runs across the tracker, it automatically
[01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:29.840]   sends a signal to me.
[01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:33.200]   So if somebody, you know, accidentally carries my keys off, I'll find them again.
[01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:34.920]   I'll know exactly where they are.
[01:26:34.920 --> 01:26:38.160]   And if you know where it is and you're approaching it, there's a distance indicator now in the
[01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:40.880]   tracker app that shows you if you're getting closer to your items.
[01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:42.400]   I love that.
[01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:44.480]   Warmer, warmer, colder, warmer, warmer.
[01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:46.480]   There's a 30 day money back guarantee.
[01:26:46.480 --> 01:26:48.040]   So there's no risk.
[01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:49.040]   Try it today.
[01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:50.480]   Go to the tracker.com.
[01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:56.040]   Use the promo code MAC break and you'll get a free tracker Bravo thrown into your order.
[01:26:56.040 --> 01:26:59.560]   Just an extra tracker for whatever you might be losing.
[01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:00.560]   Stop losing your stuff today.
[01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:04.840]   Go to the tracker, T-H-E-T-R-A-C-K-R.com.
[01:27:04.840 --> 01:27:10.440]   Use the promo code MAC break to add a free tracker Bravo to your order.
[01:27:10.440 --> 01:27:11.440]   These things are great.
[01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:12.440]   These things are awesome.
[01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:15.160]   That's your just got one.
[01:27:15.160 --> 01:27:16.760]   It's just, it's a nice feeling.
[01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:20.120]   And there's a little button you press at your iPhone will scream if you press the button
[01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:21.120]   and it's just it's in fact.
[01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:22.680]   Give it to her for a birthday.
[01:27:22.680 --> 01:27:25.040]   She said she lost her wallet for her the last time.
[01:27:25.040 --> 01:27:27.440]   Does she have an echo?
[01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:30.360]   Because if she has an echo, you can actually tell the Amazon echo.
[01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:31.360]   Find my keys.
[01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:32.560]   It's really fun.
[01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:33.560]   It's really good.
[01:27:33.560 --> 01:27:35.280]   I love it.
[01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:37.600]   All right.
[01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:39.840]   Time for our picks of the week.
[01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:42.560]   Why don't we kick things off with you, Tanya?
[01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:43.760]   Alright.
[01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:46.840]   My pick of the week, it's a little predictable.
[01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:51.120]   My pick of the week is the Strava Apple Watch app.
[01:27:51.120 --> 01:27:53.360]   I'll tell you why this is cool.
[01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:55.400]   This is the one I've been wondering which is the best.
[01:27:55.400 --> 01:27:58.640]   So for your runner, this is good.
[01:27:58.640 --> 01:28:00.480]   So I run.
[01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:06.960]   I also bicycle a lot and my go to app for these activities is Strava.
[01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:10.160]   And this is because first of all, it does so much.
[01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:14.640]   It has a zillion features for analyzing your workouts and every way imaginable.
[01:28:14.640 --> 01:28:18.600]   But more important, it's the social networking site for athletes.
[01:28:18.600 --> 01:28:22.640]   And I have probably like 50, 60, 100 friends on Strava.
[01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:26.680]   And we're all social networking in there about what we do and what we're going to do next.
[01:28:26.680 --> 01:28:28.120]   So it's pretty compelling.
[01:28:28.120 --> 01:28:32.880]   But even if you're not a trail runner or a cyclist like I am, you might just like to
[01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:34.280]   walk.
[01:28:34.280 --> 01:28:39.160]   And the best part about Strava, like the features it just grabs you is that it creates kind
[01:28:39.160 --> 01:28:44.600]   of a breadcrumb trail on a map of where you were during your walk, your run, your skate,
[01:28:44.600 --> 01:28:46.400]   your ski, whatever it is.
[01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:50.360]   And then you share that among other things with your friends on Strava.
[01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:51.840]   And it's very fun.
[01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:53.280]   It's just a huge fun.
[01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:58.600]   So to get that breadcrumb map, you've got to have a mobile GPS or a mobile device.
[01:28:58.600 --> 01:29:02.680]   Could be an iPhone, but it could be any kind of smartwatch or whatever.
[01:29:02.680 --> 01:29:07.520]   And it's got to have a GPS chip, no GPS chip, no map.
[01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:12.640]   So that was a huge problem with the series one Apple watch because didn't have a GPS
[01:29:12.640 --> 01:29:13.640]   chip.
[01:29:13.640 --> 01:29:18.400]   You could get Strava to work from it kind of sort of, but you had to have your iPhone
[01:29:18.400 --> 01:29:20.240]   with you at all times.
[01:29:20.240 --> 01:29:24.200]   If you have your iPhone with you, you might as well just run Strava from the iPhone.
[01:29:24.200 --> 01:29:27.200]   There's not a huge benefit to running it on the watch.
[01:29:27.200 --> 01:29:32.840]   So when the series two Apple watch comes out, it's got the GPS chip.
[01:29:32.840 --> 01:29:34.520]   So yay, step one.
[01:29:34.520 --> 01:29:41.040]   But now Strava has to remake their app to work well on the watch and to be able to communicate
[01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:43.280]   with the GPS chip.
[01:29:43.280 --> 01:29:45.000]   So they have done so.
[01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:48.200]   And I'm very happy to report that it works very well.
[01:29:48.200 --> 01:29:53.680]   Seems to be giving me basically identical data to what I was getting from the iPhone.
[01:29:53.680 --> 01:29:59.680]   But also to what I get from my Garmin SportsWatch and the Garmin SportsWatch is, I would say
[01:29:59.680 --> 01:30:03.320]   it's kind of the gold standard of sports watches to use a Garmin, but there are other
[01:30:03.320 --> 01:30:06.400]   sports watches that are actually really good and people like them too.
[01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:08.960]   But nobody would sort of argue with a Garmin.
[01:30:08.960 --> 01:30:12.240]   So I've been really enjoying using it.
[01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:16.760]   I find that when I go biking, I don't even need to take my Garmin anymore.
[01:30:16.760 --> 01:30:19.280]   And I can just wear one watch, the Apple watch just pushed the button.
[01:30:19.280 --> 01:30:20.480]   It works really well.
[01:30:20.480 --> 01:30:24.360]   I think they did a good job with the internals of getting it to work.
[01:30:24.360 --> 01:30:26.160]   But the interface, it's very simple.
[01:30:26.160 --> 01:30:30.280]   It's very clean for kind of what you can do on the Apple watch.
[01:30:30.280 --> 01:30:31.880]   I think they did a great job.
[01:30:31.880 --> 01:30:37.160]   So if you are a walker or an athlete and you're thinking about using Strava and you have an
[01:30:37.160 --> 01:30:42.200]   Apple watch, I recommend downloading the app, getting it installed and giving it a try.
[01:30:42.200 --> 01:30:43.200]   Very nice.
[01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:48.600]   I've been trying a lot of other ones like Runkeeper and I will try Strava.
[01:30:48.600 --> 01:30:53.840]   And I know by the way, when I join Strava, Adam seems to go out and run all the time.
[01:30:53.840 --> 01:30:58.240]   I guess I'm not following you, but man, Adam is out there all the freaking time.
[01:30:58.240 --> 01:31:01.280]   He's running, he's riding, he's going around.
[01:31:01.280 --> 01:31:02.280]   Man.
[01:31:02.280 --> 01:31:03.280]   Yep.
[01:31:03.280 --> 01:31:07.720]   We're having a good time and you can see Adam has got friends giving a little substances
[01:31:07.720 --> 01:31:08.720]   and stuff.
[01:31:08.720 --> 01:31:11.000]   So when you get on, I want a friend request on Strava.
[01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:12.000]   I will.
[01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:13.000]   Nice.
[01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:14.000]   Really cool.
[01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:15.000]   Strava.com.
[01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:19.960]   Renee Richie, your pick of the week.
[01:31:19.960 --> 01:31:21.240]   So mine is as funny as it sounds.
[01:31:21.240 --> 01:31:24.960]   It's also quasi outdoorsy and workouty related.
[01:31:24.960 --> 01:31:29.240]   As things have thought here, I've gotten back into the parks and I use the, I use using
[01:31:29.240 --> 01:31:34.080]   the Pokemon Go Apple Watch Workout app because as funny as it sounds, I find hiking really,
[01:31:34.080 --> 01:31:35.160]   really boring.
[01:31:35.160 --> 01:31:38.280]   And if I can gamify it, that just makes it much more interesting to me and I'm much more
[01:31:38.280 --> 01:31:40.120]   likely to spend more time doing it.
[01:31:40.120 --> 01:31:43.160]   And I've actually forgotten, I've gotten lost and forgotten how much time I've been out
[01:31:43.160 --> 01:31:46.680]   there and ended up walking like 10 K when I didn't really mean to just because it's
[01:31:46.680 --> 01:31:47.680]   so much fun.
[01:31:47.680 --> 01:31:50.880]   You see deadlines, you see like things in front of you, you have like small goals.
[01:31:50.880 --> 01:31:54.080]   But the problem with having even the Apple Watch app is it doesn't actually catch any
[01:31:54.080 --> 01:31:55.400]   little Pokemon for you.
[01:31:55.400 --> 01:31:58.960]   It'll tell you when they're there, it'll, it'll hatch eggs and stuff for you, but it
[01:31:58.960 --> 01:32:01.280]   won't let you spin polka stops and we'll let you catch things.
[01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:03.560]   And you're, so you're always looking at your screen, you get the notification, you pull
[01:32:03.560 --> 01:32:04.560]   your phone out.
[01:32:04.560 --> 01:32:08.720]   And I hate that because it returns me to that sort of crunching Bill Gates stature that I'm
[01:32:08.720 --> 01:32:09.720]   trying to get out of.
[01:32:09.720 --> 01:32:12.640]   I just stand up like a human being, like a super person again.
[01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:14.360]   And I don't want to be slave to my phone screen.
[01:32:14.360 --> 01:32:18.320]   So I got this from my God sons and myself over the Easter holidays.
[01:32:18.320 --> 01:32:19.480]   It's called a Pokemon Go Plus.
[01:32:19.480 --> 01:32:22.600]   It's a little accessory made by the Pokemon company.
[01:32:22.600 --> 01:32:26.280]   And all it is is a Bluetooth accessory and it pairs to your phone.
[01:32:26.280 --> 01:32:30.440]   And whenever there's a polka stop or a Pokemon there, it flashes with a light and you press
[01:32:30.440 --> 01:32:32.640]   that light and it'll try to catch it for you.
[01:32:32.640 --> 01:32:36.520]   And it's very easy to keep on your wrist or to keep on your hand and you can walk like
[01:32:36.520 --> 01:32:37.520]   it.
[01:32:37.520 --> 01:32:38.520]   You actually bought that.
[01:32:38.520 --> 01:32:39.520]   I can't.
[01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:40.520]   I bought several of these.
[01:32:40.520 --> 01:32:46.720]   So it was so much fun because I wanted to take them to a new park every weekend.
[01:32:46.720 --> 01:32:49.280]   That's my goal for the summer because I've discovered so many of these things.
[01:32:49.280 --> 01:32:52.160]   Like there's just so many around me that are really nice that I never noticed.
[01:32:52.160 --> 01:32:54.560]   I just was driving past on the highways all the time.
[01:32:54.560 --> 01:32:57.960]   But there are acres and acres and acres of really beautiful land and they said that
[01:32:57.960 --> 01:32:58.960]   they'd come with me.
[01:32:58.960 --> 01:32:59.960]   And that's great.
[01:32:59.960 --> 01:33:01.560]   And this is sort of just an extra motivator.
[01:33:01.560 --> 01:33:04.600]   So instead of again, instead of having them slave to their phones, I have their phones
[01:33:04.600 --> 01:33:07.640]   in my backpack and they have a little button they can press and later on they can check
[01:33:07.640 --> 01:33:10.320]   and see all the stuff that they got when they were out.
[01:33:10.320 --> 01:33:11.320]   And they really enjoyed it.
[01:33:11.320 --> 01:33:13.160]   And there's a Pokemon event going on right now.
[01:33:13.160 --> 01:33:16.720]   It's their spring event where you get like double experience points and you can hatch
[01:33:16.720 --> 01:33:18.440]   a bunch of extra eggs.
[01:33:18.440 --> 01:33:21.000]   And they're loving it because they were on holiday in Quebec.
[01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.600]   You know, Easter is a big thing because Quebec is a really religious province.
[01:33:23.600 --> 01:33:27.680]   So they've had four days off of school and we've gone to a new park every day and they
[01:33:27.680 --> 01:33:28.680]   just press this little button.
[01:33:28.680 --> 01:33:29.680]   We're running around.
[01:33:29.680 --> 01:33:30.680]   We walked around the lake.
[01:33:30.680 --> 01:33:33.920]   We walked along a long a riverside.
[01:33:33.920 --> 01:33:34.920]   And it was phenomenal.
[01:33:34.920 --> 01:33:35.920]   And nobody was looking at their phones.
[01:33:35.920 --> 01:33:38.080]   We were chatting, we were talking, you know, everyone's in a while, they were pressing
[01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:39.080]   this little button.
[01:33:39.080 --> 01:33:42.160]   And then when they got home, they got to look at all the stuff they managed to collect,
[01:33:42.160 --> 01:33:45.320]   almost like a scavenger hunt while they were out.
[01:33:45.320 --> 01:33:46.320]   It's not inexpensive.
[01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:50.920]   It's about $40 Canadian, which I guess is like 12 bucks US or whatever it is these days.
[01:33:50.920 --> 01:33:52.480]   And it pairs very simply.
[01:33:52.480 --> 01:33:56.520]   And if you have kids who share phones, because you don't have a phone for the kids, obviously,
[01:33:56.520 --> 01:33:57.520]   it pairs per phones.
[01:33:57.520 --> 01:34:00.320]   You don't have to worry about unparing it and repairing it, which is because they switch
[01:34:00.320 --> 01:34:01.320]   accounts.
[01:34:01.320 --> 01:34:03.520]   So it's really easy to set up and use.
[01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:04.880]   And they had a blast with it.
[01:34:04.880 --> 01:34:07.480]   And I find it like a little bit much all the time.
[01:34:07.480 --> 01:34:11.080]   But when you're out with a family and friends and stuff and you're all just walking, it
[01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:12.080]   was awesome.
[01:34:12.080 --> 01:34:14.200]   We had a lot of fun with it.
[01:34:14.200 --> 01:34:16.200]   Very nice.
[01:34:16.200 --> 01:34:17.200]   How much is it?
[01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:18.200]   It's Canadian.
[01:34:18.200 --> 01:34:21.760]   It was like 40 bucks, but I ordered it off Amazon and that was the total.
[01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:24.560]   So when it first came out, they...
[01:34:24.560 --> 01:34:25.560]   You couldn't buy it.
[01:34:25.560 --> 01:34:26.560]   It could get out of stock forever.
[01:34:26.560 --> 01:34:29.880]   And now it's in stock again, which is how I managed to pick it up.
[01:34:29.880 --> 01:34:30.880]   Nice.
[01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:33.360]   And for people who are actually serious about the game, I managed to get like 2 million
[01:34:33.360 --> 01:34:35.040]   experience points over the weekend with it.
[01:34:35.040 --> 01:34:38.840]   So you can level up fast, folks.
[01:34:38.840 --> 01:34:40.480]   2 million.
[01:34:40.480 --> 01:34:42.480]   You be you, Renee.
[01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:43.480]   Never, never.
[01:34:43.480 --> 01:34:45.880]   I mean, again, so it's pretty...
[01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:46.880]   I'm not even...
[01:34:46.880 --> 01:34:48.280]   I don't even mean that as an insult.
[01:34:48.280 --> 01:34:50.280]   I mean, just...
[01:34:50.280 --> 01:34:58.760]   That is so satisfying to me because you are so enjoying your innate renee-ness with this
[01:34:58.760 --> 01:34:59.760]   device.
[01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:00.760]   Okay, I didn't mean the way that said.
[01:35:00.760 --> 01:35:05.960]   I'm out and enjoying myself more than I have been in years and it's a lot of fun to me.
[01:35:05.960 --> 01:35:09.160]   Andy and I co-stole my pick of the week, so I'll share this with you.
[01:35:09.160 --> 01:35:10.160]   Go ahead, Andy.
[01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:12.640]   Well, we'll make it a great pick of the week.
[01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:14.680]   There's another awesome miss in this.
[01:35:14.680 --> 01:35:15.680]   Archive.org...
[01:35:15.680 --> 01:35:23.160]   The Internet Archive has the holy task of preserving all creation, all knowledge, all
[01:35:23.160 --> 01:35:27.000]   humanity in digital form and any form they can get it at.
[01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:31.440]   And for a while, they've had the ability to even preserve video games by having emulators
[01:35:31.440 --> 01:35:34.720]   for old arcade systems and old game platforms.
[01:35:34.720 --> 01:35:41.400]   Recently, however, just this month, they introduced in web browser Macintosh emulation.
[01:35:41.400 --> 01:35:48.840]   So it's not just they have System 6, System 7, MacRite, MacPaint, Dark Castle, all the
[01:35:48.840 --> 01:35:53.120]   old games that you know and love, a lot of the old productivity stuff, the legendary
[01:35:53.120 --> 01:35:59.600]   Microsoft basic that was the first big turf fight between Apple and Microsoft over the
[01:35:59.600 --> 01:36:01.600]   future of reality.
[01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:06.400]   But you also, you don't have to like, you go, you don't have to download all these emulators
[01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:10.320]   and these sort of not quite legal places to make it run.
[01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:15.920]   You just simply double click it and within your web browser, it will launch an emulator,
[01:36:15.920 --> 01:36:19.480]   tiny emulator because it's only a tiny Mac screen.
[01:36:19.480 --> 01:36:25.720]   And I'll be darned it is the exact experience of booting up a Mac, seeing the happy Mac,
[01:36:25.720 --> 01:36:27.400]   seeing it boot into the game.
[01:36:27.400 --> 01:36:32.840]   Your mouse is the app is the virtual Mac's mouse.
[01:36:32.840 --> 01:36:37.160]   For gaming, it's a little bit hit or miss because some of the audio doesn't work quite
[01:36:37.160 --> 01:36:38.160]   right.
[01:36:38.160 --> 01:36:45.080]   But Leo is playing Dark Castle right now and it will be such a nostalgia like bullet to
[01:36:45.080 --> 01:36:49.400]   the brain of hearing these sounds and seeing these things like for the first time.
[01:36:49.400 --> 01:36:52.840]   Since 1986, 1987 for old timers.
[01:36:52.840 --> 01:36:59.400]   But even people who weren't really mastering their ABCs back then just to be able to play
[01:36:59.400 --> 01:37:04.000]   with Mac paint and Mac right and see that, oh my God, you have to hold down the mouse
[01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:08.840]   button to keep the menus down like, oh my God.
[01:37:08.840 --> 01:37:11.800]   The only thing that could have made it better is that I can't figure, I don't think there
[01:37:11.800 --> 01:37:15.800]   is a way that you can write in Mac right and it's actually fast enough that you can, it'll
[01:37:15.800 --> 01:37:18.200]   actually keep up with normal typing.
[01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:21.800]   I wish that there were some way to get the files out again.
[01:37:21.800 --> 01:37:28.120]   Because again, it literally is an emulated Mac with virtual floppy disks.
[01:37:28.120 --> 01:37:31.480]   So you're booting off the fake Mac right disk.
[01:37:31.480 --> 01:37:35.600]   You are double clicking on the Mac right icon to grade it.
[01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:39.000]   You are saving files and the files appear on that virtual disk.
[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.200]   But when you shut down, of course, that disk goes away.
[01:37:41.200 --> 01:37:44.920]   I really wish there was a way that I could sort of drag it out of the emulator and onto
[01:37:44.920 --> 01:37:47.480]   something else because it would be.
[01:37:47.480 --> 01:37:53.480]   I have used Mac emulators on Raspberry Pi and those things are a lot of fun.
[01:37:53.480 --> 01:37:58.160]   It would be kind of fun to just if I'm having this order day where I just need to distract
[01:37:58.160 --> 01:38:03.160]   myself and trick myself into working to say, you know what, I will spend today in Mac right
[01:38:03.160 --> 01:38:08.000]   in 1985 and that's going to be my work environment.
[01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.720]   Unfortunately, you can't, Apple talk there.
[01:38:10.720 --> 01:38:14.840]   If you go into the control panel, you can't turn Apple talk on and off.
[01:38:14.840 --> 01:38:20.960]   But there is no way that I can tell to get it to see the other computers on your network.
[01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:22.960]   Maybe they'll have them flipped on the future.
[01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:25.800]   I'm crazy do you want to get here?
[01:38:25.800 --> 01:38:28.480]   Apple talk you want Apple talk to work.
[01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:30.360]   I just I want the whole thing.
[01:38:30.360 --> 01:38:33.800]   I don't want to be just like 52% ridiculous.
[01:38:33.800 --> 01:38:36.800]   I want to be 100% impractical and insane.
[01:38:36.800 --> 01:38:37.800]   I want to have this.
[01:38:37.800 --> 01:38:39.280]   I want to have everything.
[01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:46.360]   And I will also say that it's I just love the idea of just like a piece of music is and
[01:38:46.360 --> 01:38:49.600]   doesn't become trash just because it's 230 years old.
[01:38:49.600 --> 01:38:54.160]   And the culture that it was designed to entertain is long dead and buried.
[01:38:54.160 --> 01:38:59.240]   It's worthy of preservation so that people can still listen to it because it is a piece
[01:38:59.240 --> 01:39:01.160]   of art, a piece of craftsmanship.
[01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:05.440]   And since the expression of someone's worldview and I think software is the exact same thing.
[01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:10.080]   So it really is wonderful that someone can again fire up Mac paint and maybe they don't
[01:39:10.080 --> 01:39:15.960]   understand why this was revolutionary at the time to be able to draw with a mouse and see
[01:39:15.960 --> 01:39:18.320]   black pixels on a white background.
[01:39:18.320 --> 01:39:22.840]   But they will have at least some of the experience of what people went through and what it was
[01:39:22.840 --> 01:39:26.080]   like for those people who survived the 80s.
[01:39:26.080 --> 01:39:30.600]   If I could just get these lemmings not to fall splat I'd be much happier.
[01:39:30.600 --> 01:39:36.840]   Oh well what's next beer run.
[01:39:36.840 --> 01:39:41.880]   They also have shuffle pucker shuffle puck which was my favorite game of the entire 80s.
[01:39:41.880 --> 01:39:47.400]   I would oh my god like that the amount of exercise that Renee gets in Pokemon go that's
[01:39:47.400 --> 01:39:52.360]   how much exercise I got with shuffle puck because it's air hockey and it uses like your
[01:39:52.360 --> 01:39:54.960]   mouse as your air hockey stick.
[01:39:54.960 --> 01:39:59.080]   And so you're actually sliding something on a flat surface just like you would it responds
[01:39:59.080 --> 01:40:03.880]   to like putting English on the ball and it was like oh I would just I would play this
[01:40:03.880 --> 01:40:08.760]   game like in the student in my the student computer lounge and just be like standing
[01:40:08.760 --> 01:40:14.360]   up at this desk cursing the thing because I'm in full John Mackin row mode.
[01:40:14.360 --> 01:40:17.800]   Say no come on I hit that time.
[01:40:17.800 --> 01:40:24.920]   Yeah by the way hyper card also available if you boot up the a 7.0.1 system compilation
[01:40:24.920 --> 01:40:29.520]   it has hyper card in it which is as well as shuffle puck in fact that we played shuffle
[01:40:29.520 --> 01:40:33.640]   puck on Twitter on Sunday it was so fun to see that again.
[01:40:33.640 --> 01:40:38.080]   Man how cool to be able to put to create your own disk files locally.
[01:40:38.080 --> 01:40:41.680]   It would not be nice to introduce them into their like like for hyper card to great be
[01:40:41.680 --> 01:40:46.560]   able to like load up your own hyper card stacks or save this anyway it's I'm looking forward
[01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:52.480]   to the evolution of this I think this is 100% of the great a great thing to happen in April
[01:40:52.480 --> 01:40:56.760]   and it leaves me like throwing my wallet at the screen because I just want you people
[01:40:56.760 --> 01:40:59.920]   to have money you did wonderful things that made me happy.
[01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:04.680]   Jason Scott gets credit for at least uploading it and I presume for writing the emulation
[01:41:04.680 --> 01:41:11.320]   and this is the system 7 booting cannon fodder risk shuffle puck and if I get the mouse to
[01:41:11.320 --> 01:41:17.280]   move you can see that hyper card is also in the app folder as well as Mac draw Mac paint
[01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:24.560]   Microsoft works so this is like everything this is like a compilation the system 7 compilation
[01:41:24.560 --> 01:41:30.400]   it's way it's fun to see this again isn't it though yeah actually maybe it's just a hyper
[01:41:30.400 --> 01:41:35.880]   card player not a hyper card creator you like iPhone running in the holodeck one yeah put
[01:41:35.880 --> 01:41:38.480]   this on an iPhone I'd be happy that that would be hyper card to put that so that's the
[01:41:38.480 --> 01:41:44.720]   Claris edition at a player in addition to hyper card regular so maybe there's another
[01:41:44.720 --> 01:41:48.680]   hyper card this one is nice because it has two hard drives you know yeah here you go you
[01:41:48.680 --> 01:41:54.720]   got the whole eight whole eight megabytes of storage the other thing that's really great
[01:41:54.720 --> 01:41:59.840]   about this is it's not an April Fool's joke right it's really doing it's real it is April
[01:41:59.840 --> 01:42:04.400]   and it's it's not a joke it's for real soon but Andy I think what's going to come is they're
[01:42:04.400 --> 01:42:09.780]   going to start a monthly subscription service 1299 a month and then you will be able to
[01:42:09.780 --> 01:42:14.000]   get your stuff in and out just like you were just driving through the whole you know apple
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:18.080]   talk you know control panel or whatever they called it back then things but it's a desk
[01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:23.520]   accessory I believe it would be yeah interesting 99 a month actually Jason is one of the archivists
[01:42:23.520 --> 01:42:33.360]   April 1st hey oh never mind you can read fun things like that in tidbits you better subscribe
[01:42:33.360 --> 01:42:37.280]   I don't know why you wouldn't be in oh my god that would be that would be so cool Tony
[01:42:37.280 --> 01:42:41.240]   if you went at him just found a way to like work with them so the people could read like
[01:42:41.240 --> 01:42:47.960]   the tidbits of 1985 1986 in the hypertext work didn't have an app yeah didn't you have a
[01:42:47.960 --> 01:42:53.680]   hypercard app yeah we have the first hundred the first hundred issues so a little over
[01:42:53.680 --> 01:42:59.600]   two years were in a hypercard stack we we ran into this little problem where we didn't
[01:42:59.600 --> 01:43:05.800]   anticipate that we would go out to a hundred issues we we only for two digits for two digits
[01:43:05.800 --> 01:43:11.640]   so a couple things started to change around that digits that's that's funny thank you
[01:43:11.640 --> 01:43:16.600]   Tony for being here great to have you don't forget tidbits.com become a sustaining subscriber
[01:43:16.600 --> 01:43:24.520]   and help keep this amazing resource alive for 27 more years that is just really fantastic
[01:43:24.520 --> 01:43:30.480]   and don't forget the the book series to the take control book series is really a great
[01:43:30.480 --> 01:43:35.560]   resource if you want to learn something about almost anything tidbits.com
