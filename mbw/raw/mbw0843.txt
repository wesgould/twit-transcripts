[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly. Alex Lindsay's here. Andy Inacco. Jason Snell. We're going to talk
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   about a bunch of different things. Apple's slowdown in China and why it's a delicate balancing act.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:22.800]   Emails inside Apple tell us why there never will be eye messages on Android and Apple's building a
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.240]   live television advertising network. Should Apple be in the ad business? That and a whole lot more.

[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:43.360]   together and talk about the latest Apple news with three of my favorite Apple pundits, Jason Snell,
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:49.920]   six colors dot com. Hello, Jason. Hello, Leo. Good to be here. Nice to see you in the rain.
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:59.520]   You said you had an inch. I made it through the rain. No singing. We've had the singing already.
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:08.800]   Here comes the rain again. Oh, no. Also, Andy and I co-wj, B.H. Boston. Good to see you, Andrew.
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.040]   That's good. I'm only happy when it's rain. I'm really only happy when it's complicated.
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:20.800]   Well, it was complicated earlier. We're moving. We are using Zoom right now, but we're using Zoom
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:28.960]   with a different computer for each participant. That's how we did the isolated audio and video.
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.880]   There is a new Zoom technology, which Alex has been talking a lot about, called Zoom ISO.
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:39.200]   We tried it this morning. It didn't work too well. We're starting a little late. This is Alex
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.640]   Lindsay, who is the mastermind behind Office Hours.Global, and the king of Zoom ISO. He's
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.560]   what it told us all about it. We use a lot of Zoom ISO. Our pipeline is a little different,
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:55.120]   but it's, but we, I shot a video of you demonstrating your pipeline, which I said to John.
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:02.560]   That's the little pipeline, because that's eight. In Office Hours, we can go up to 20 people at one
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.640]   time. I have to say, in our preliminary testing, it really is much better. There's
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:14.080]   almost no latency, which means we don't have those interruption problems that have plagued us
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:20.480]   since 2004. Since the Bush administration.
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:27.360]   Bush administration. To be frank, we want to thank Andy Carlucio, who is the event engineering
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.840]   manager at Zoom. He came by, provided us with some equipment, showed us how to set it up.
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.640]   He did a great job. Thank you, especially to Alex Lindsay, who has been the master of that.
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:42.880]   And next week, you will hear the new improved Zoom ISO version of Mac break weekly.
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:51.040]   So, biggest Apple news of the week, Apple admitting that COVID shutdowns in China
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:58.960]   are impacting the manufacturer of iPhone 14 Pro and Macs. I guess they don't really care too much
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:05.600]   about iPhone 14, because nobody's buying that. This is the quote from their press release.
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:11.280]   "COVID-19 restrictions have temporarily impacted the primary iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:17.680]   Macs assembly facility located in Zhengzhou, China. The facility is operating at significantly reduced
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:26.240]   capacity." And this is of course due to COVID-19. We expect lower iPhone Pro 14 Pro and 14 Pro
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:32.000]   Macs shipments than we previously anticipated. You will receive longer wait times to get your new
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.080]   products. So, if you hadn't ordered and received, I guess, if you'd ordered and got a date,
[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:43.040]   you probably cool. But if you're ordering now, you may not get it. I don't know. I haven't looked.
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:48.640]   Jason, has people started complaining about this? I mean, they're definitely, those dates are
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:53.600]   pushing back. So, we're definitely seeing some of that happening. And this is like, this happened
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:05:00.080]   actually in the spring, but it was in Shanghai and it was the Mac assembly facility. And it actually
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.400]   drove Macsales down for a quarter and then they rebounded last quarter. But there was that period
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.000]   in there where if you tried to buy a Mac, it would say you need to wait a month or two,
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.680]   which is really unprecedented. The Tim Cook machine, every one that comes off the assembly
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:19.840]   line is bought at that moment. That's the dream for Tim Cook. And the Mac stuff was hard,
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:26.160]   but the Mac is only a portion of Apple's revenue. The iPhone is more than half of Apple's revenue
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:33.440]   most of the time. And this is the most popular product, right? The iPhone 12 Pro, 14 Pro. So,
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:39.920]   this is brutal. I mean, like, they're, this came out on a Sunday. It is sort of mandated that this
[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:44.880]   is a material effect on their business. But I think what it is strongly suggesting is that when
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:50.720]   they report their results in three months, iPhone sales are going to be hit by this because people
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:55.360]   are, it's, this is their quarter. This is their highest quarter for everything, including the iPhone
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:59.760]   and their most popular iPhones are not going to be available or in limited quantities. And
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:04.560]   maybe they can spin things up, but you get the sense from what's happened before when they,
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:10.240]   when they sort of taper off, everything kind of stops and then it doesn't just flip back to 100%.
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.280]   There's a whole process they have to go through to get back up to speed.
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:19.600]   I just tried to order an iPhone 14 Pro December 9th delivery, which isn't the worst. I mean,
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:24.960]   it's a month. You know, that's not, it's not like next year. It's just not Tim Cook's ideal, right?
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:30.560]   Yeah, you want to make as many as you can sell. And I think, I think that we, I think that there
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:36.000]   are so many issues right now with China production, Chinese production that, that I think that you're
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.560]   seeing Apple and a lot of other folks starting to try to diversify. Now, some of it's required.
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:48.240]   So Brazil and India require them to build some of it in their country to sell into that market.
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:53.440]   But I think that you're also looking at Vietnam is benefiting from kind of a move out of China.
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.160]   And I think that you'll see a lot of companies continue to do that. I think that there's a lot
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:02.560]   of concern, as we've talked about before, around doing it all between the variety of issues with
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:08.560]   COVID to infrastructural issues that China is starting to experience to Taiwan. There's just a lot of
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:13.840]   risk that that is getting applied to everybody's production that's happening in the country.
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:20.080]   There is it was an interesting piece in Financial Times yesterday. Apple's bargain with Beijing
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:27.760]   access to China's factories and consumers. And the point of it was that Tim Cook has played a very
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:38.240]   canny game meeting with President Xi many times pre pandemic to basically get free reign in China,
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:47.440]   which has benefited them hugely in terms of sales. And of course, it means that it's important.
[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:54.080]   Chinese manufacturing is important. And I think it may also mean that,
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:58.080]   do you think it might mean that Apple might be slow to pull out of
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:04.160]   full manufacturing out of China? For everyone, it's five to 10 years.
[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:07.920]   And I don't think they're diversifying. I don't think it's going to be like,
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:11.520]   oh, we're not going to do any more work in China. I think that they just need to move it from 100%
[00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:16.880]   down to 30%. I think it would make a big difference in the ability to flex if they needed to.
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:21.760]   Yeah, it was an interesting article because it did make the point that
[00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:28.160]   Apple has not Apple succeeded not only getting getting into a good relationship with China,
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:34.160]   but also tying a lot of Chinese manufacturing prestige with Apple. So they're very, very much
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:41.120]   in a slightly symbiotic relationship where they benefit each other, which is why Tim Cook has
[00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:46.880]   this back channel pipeline to the person who can get things done. So if you need manufacturing,
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:53.200]   if you need a problem solved, if you need a factory opened, if you need diversions of resources to
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:57.680]   make sure that your product line remains free and flexible, you're going to get it. It also made
[00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:04.880]   the good point that sanctions against China from the US has hurt Chinese phone makers and actually
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:09.680]   enhanced Apple and made the Apple, I think they're saying the number one tech company,
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:15.200]   if not the number one phone manufacturer in China right now with some Jason Snell-like graphs to
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:19.360]   back up the point. Yeah, this is actually the interesting graph. Huawei, remember when Huawei
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:26.640]   was banned in the US, Chinese consumers, patriotically jumped on Huawei and you could see that they
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:34.960]   had as much as like 27% of the market in the first half of 2020. It is plummeted and Apple has grown
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:41.120]   commensurately. Huawei's chair of the Chinese market says the financial time is plummeted
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:50.000]   from a high of 29% in mid 2020 to just 7% 2022. And while Apple's chair jumped from 9% to 17%.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.520]   Well, I think also the Huawei phones, I've had some Huawei phones and they're just not very good.
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:10:02.000]   I mean, that's the problem is you're competing for a, you know, if you're competing in the luxury
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.160]   market, the Huawei phones just aren't really competitive with even other Chinese phones.
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:12.480]   It's a, the iPhone is the prestige brand that as you have more people going,
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:17.200]   as the middle class is getting a little bit more the same way that the middle class in the United
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:20.880]   States was in the 50s and 60s saying, Hey, I want to make sure that I've got the great car. I've got
[00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:25.840]   the great house. I've got the great whatever. I've got the new washing machine. The thing that
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:30.720]   the middle class wants are prestige Apple phones and not domestic made, you know,
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:36.080]   though domestic made label common phones that they can get with their current stuff.
[00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:41.520]   And a symbiosis here is, I think really interesting, the idea that it's very easy to look at China
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:45.920]   and say, well, China is this giant country. And so like Apple needs China and China doesn't need
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:50.480]   Apple. And that's not true. Right. Like it goes both ways. And that's the reason Apple has escaped
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:54.400]   in times when, especially during the Trump administration, right, there was all of the
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:11:00.320]   cyber rattling and like we're gonna, we're gonna nobody buy anything from these various Chinese
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:06.000]   companies. And it would have been so easy for them to be like, well, fine, Apple is now out of China.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.240]   And that didn't happen for a reason for because they've cultivated this relationship. But it does.
[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:15.920]   And you know, from Chinese perspective, it gives them manufacturing prestige. It does. It makes
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:20.880]   the people in China really happy. They love having the ability to buy an Apple product. And if that
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:25.280]   went away, they would be a little less happy and as much power as the Chinese Communist Party has,
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:31.600]   you don't want to make the people really angry with you, right? Like you want to have some level
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:35.280]   where they feel like they're comfortable. And so they're not going to rock the boat.
[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:40.400]   So there's a lot going on in that. It's funny now though, to look at it and think the problem is
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:44.880]   that if it gets out of balance at all, Apple has all their eggs in that basket. That's the right,
[00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:50.480]   like it's not all they are doing some iPhone manufacturing in India and some in Brazil. And
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:54.080]   I've heard about a bunch of stuff that they're trying to spin up in Vietnam. And like they are
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:12:00.400]   trying it seems like the Shanghai shutdown actually back in the spring was one of those moments where
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:07.120]   they realized they actually need to start moving on not relying only on China. But
[00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:12.960]   that relationship, yeah, benefits China and benefits Apple. It really is symbiotic in a very
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:20.480]   strange way. It still underscores the problems that the risks that Apple is taking, where what
[00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:25.520]   happens if China decides to invade Taiwan? What if they decide to even increase their
[00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:32.960]   crackdowns on Hong Kong? What if there is their human rights violations that become on the world's
[00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:38.720]   scale kind of like Russia's invasion of Ukraine? Is that going to how dangerous how
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:44.880]   caustic will that relationship become for Apple to be so closely tied with China? So it's a dancing
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:48.880]   act for sure. They're cut between a rock and a hard place though. If they want this Chinese
[00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:54.640]   market, it's been I know from these colorful graphs at six colors dot com. The China market has been a
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:59.840]   big propellant in Apple's success over the last couple of years. And the growth there is very
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:05.920]   important to Apple. This is also from the Financial Times. Apple's worked hard to satisfy the tastes
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:11.680]   of Chinese customers. When local competitors rolled out smartphones with bigger screens like the Huawei
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:16.800]   Honor, more advanced cameras with low light photography. Xiaomi's stuff is pretty amazing.
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:22.720]   And a dual SIM card slot was Apple's Chinese employees who pushed the Cupertino based company
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:28.000]   to follow suit said one person close to the China operations. I might question that. I think there's
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.920]   been pressure, global pressure towards in those directions. But Tim Cook himself has credited
[00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:40.400]   feedback from Chinese customers for a quote, ton of features. This is Cook speaking now,
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:49.040]   including night mode and a QR code reader. Again, I'm quoting from FT even 5G in a lot of ways
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:55.280]   said Cook was energized in China, because China so far ahead in the coverage model for 5G. So
[00:13:55.280 --> 00:14:01.200]   list. So we this is Tim Cook finishing up. He was telling this it was on a social media interview
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:05.600]   with a 22 year old Chinese student. So we listened very carefully to our customers.
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:11.040]   Yeah. And it's a big customer base. Right. So they listen a lot to the United States.
[00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:13.760]   They also want to China because it was the two of their biggest customers.
[00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:18.640]   By the way, we should also point out that Brazil facility is built not just to diversify,
[00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:22.720]   but because Brazil has a huge tariff on stuff, not tariffs, Maine and Brazil.
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:25.840]   And India is the same way. Same thing with India. So it's what I was saying.
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:28.960]   Yeah. But it also gives Apple a little plausible deniability when China goes,
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:31.360]   why are you making iPhones somewhere other than here? They're like, well,
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:35.840]   we have to. And you know, tariffs are. We don't want to.
[00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:41.280]   President Xi understand. And right now, I thought is 90 production is 95% in China.
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:46.800]   Right. And we comply with all local laws. And we're forced to China. I'm sorry.
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:53.680]   And we're forced. And I think that the thing is, is that the COVID breakdowns and everything else
[00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:57.840]   also give them a little cover to just start stepping away going, well, this was really a big deal for
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:01.680]   us. We lost billions of dollars. We need to make sure that we can keep on doing it. So I think that
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:04.880]   they've got a little coverage. I think that the big thing that I think most people are worried
[00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:08.720]   about is Taiwan. You know, after, you know, how do you, you know, because it just was
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:14.240]   un-hannable to stay in Russia when after they went into Ukraine, some companies held out for a
[00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:18.320]   little while, but it looks, it's just the damage to the brand is so heavy. And for Apple, it would be
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:22.960]   devastating. You know, if China went into Taiwan, Apple would have to stop. Like they would have to,
[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:27.680]   like they wouldn't be able to maintain their brand if China's going into Taiwan. And so they
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:32.160]   have to figure out a way that they're going to be able to, and services help them too. Like services
[00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:35.840]   are something they don't need to do in China. I'll tell you what. So that's, that's, that's the
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:40.800]   issue. If you wanted to appoint a diplomat to China, Tim Cook could be a pretty good choice, right?
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:46.720]   And we did that also. Because he's really, he feels like he's a very calm, rational
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:52.320]   actor. I think he acts in the best interest of his company. And to some degree, the US, I think he
[00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:59.680]   can, he considers that you have to compare Apple's success in China with meta and alphabet and
[00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:05.200]   Netflix, all of which are banned in China. He's also been able to save, let's save this relationship.
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:09.120]   He looks at where his lines really can be. Like, you know, he'll give you the cloud data,
[00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:13.840]   but he won't give you the phone data. He will, he'll look at also how to delay things in one,
[00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:20.080]   in the EU, they were able to delay the USB-C ruling until it didn't matter anymore. You know,
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:24.080]   and I think that he did a pretty good job at managing his relationship with Trump.
[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:28.960]   He's obviously not a big, probably not. I would doubt that Tim Cook voted for Trump, but he was
[00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:37.120]   able to maintain a relationship with him that kept, kept Apple out of the mix of all the fighting
[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:43.120]   back and forth that Trump did with China. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That is true. It's, it is a deal with it.
[00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:49.760]   You do have to be concerned about it, making deals with the devil. The legitimacy that he gave
[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:55.840]   Trump by sitting right next to him and participating in this sort of stuff, when you might want to
[00:16:55.840 --> 00:17:00.320]   have put some distance and not sort of help people, you allowing Trump to use an Apple
[00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:06.720]   manufacturing facility in Texas for a really, really, really bad photo op about how the benefits
[00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:12.880]   that Trump is building to bring jobs out of, bring manufacturing out of, out of Asia and back into
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:22.000]   the United States. And those are almost philosophical questions, questions to have. But it's, the other
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.600]   difference is that Apple is not in a business where it really threatens China. Apple is in a
[00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:32.480]   business of manufacturing hardware, where this is something that benefits China by, again,
[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:37.840]   giving them lots of manufacturing jobs, giving them very, very well paying, very high manufacturing
[00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:42.560]   jobs where workers are treated extremely well compared to pretty much every other manufacturer.
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:47.280]   It's, whereas it's impossible for Google to participate, it's impossible for Twitter to
[00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:51.600]   participate. It's impossible for Facebook to participate because their product is all about
[00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:57.360]   free access to information and free access to, to people forming groups with each other,
[00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:01.520]   which are, which is anathema to what the government wants its people to be able to do.
[00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:06.880]   So yeah, Apple definitely has a leg, several legs up on every, every other major United States
[00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:11.760]   tech company in that regard. Yeah. Yeah, I think the big concern is the, I mean, and we've touched
[00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:16.080]   on it here, but Ben Thompson on Strutechary this week wrote about the, you refer to it in a good
[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:20.160]   way, the Black Swan event, right? The idea of the thing that is almost the unexpected event that
[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:25.760]   nobody thinks will occur or could occur, but it occurs anyway. And that is that the Black Swan
[00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:32.160]   event for Apple is what Andy said about China attacks Taiwan. It's similar to Russia and Ukraine.
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:37.680]   You end up in a situation where it's untenable for Western companies to be in China anymore.
[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:43.680]   What happens to Apple? And it's not good, right? It's really not good. And that is the, and Apple
[00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:46.720]   is the most, you know, one of the most valuable companies in the world, one of the most powerful
[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:53.600]   companies in the world. But if they lose their Chinese manufacturing, let aside the size of the
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:57.600]   accessible market for their products, if they lose their manufacturing base in China,
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:04.880]   you just have a situation where suddenly there are no more iPhones or Macs available for years.
[00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:10.160]   Like it's, Apple's got the cash they can survive, but that is, that is an event so catastrophic.
[00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:14.800]   Well, yeah, well, and that's the thing. It's an event so catastrophic that it's like saying,
[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:19.040]   well, it's a very low chance we're going to be hit by a meteor or an asteroid or a comet.
[00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:23.360]   But if it does happen, we all die. Right? Like, it is that kind of an event.
[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:28.800]   Yeah, the math that I often use when I talk about, you know, the mathematical definition for me for
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:34.560]   risk is the chance of something happening multiplied by the impact, you know, like the consequences,
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:38.240]   you know, and so, yeah, you're absolutely right. The chances are very low, but the consequences
[00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:43.120]   are so devastating that the risk is very high. And I think that the, that it is,
[00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:47.920]   I think that Apple has to keep moving away. I think that they also have to start thinking
[00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:52.560]   about their cash position. They spend a lot of money on dividends. They spend a lot of money on
[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:57.360]   buybacks. And they have to start thinking about making sure that they have the cash position
[00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:02.800]   to weather a pretty heavy storm. And I think a lot of companies that are heavily invested in China
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:07.200]   need to think about it because, you know, China has not given up on Taiwan. And we can see in
[00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:12.800]   Ukraine again, you, they're not going to be able to, if China goes into Taiwan, these companies are
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:16.400]   not going to be able to maintain their brand and maintain the production at the same time.
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:18.240]   Yeah, there's some, that's we withering.
[00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:23.200]   There's some interesting economic pressure on China now because as we've cut off high-end chip,
[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:31.120]   US high-end chips to China, they may well be eyeing Taiwan as the way to get that back,
[00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:36.000]   you know, take over Taiwan, you get TSMC, you get a number of foundries that make those high-end
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.240]   chips. NVIDIA did an interesting thing this week. They announced that they were going to continue to
[00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:46.800]   sell a lower-end A100 chip to China to end around those restrictions.
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:52.640]   I don't think that, I don't think, I think that from a speech many years ago, I think that would
[00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:56.480]   be ashes in their mouth. If they went, they went to the Taiwan thing and they were going to get TMS.
[00:20:56.480 --> 00:21:00.720]   Yeah, no, yeah, I guess, I think it was a good way to put it. Yeah, it would just, it would be,
[00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:03.760]   there'd be nothing left by the time they got there because no one would be doing any work with them,
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:07.280]   you know, and so, you know, going in that way would be, would be brutal.
[00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:14.400]   Yeah, this is Ben Thompson talking about this, points out that China focused on manufacture,
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:20.640]   labor-centric components like assembling an iPhone, and less so on the high technology things like
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:29.920]   chips. And so they are now in a tough position because of being cut off, China's going to have to.
[00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:34.720]   Well, and the trouble they have is they have a lot of tough positions. You know, they have a,
[00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:42.160]   they have their, they have a population bomb that is massive, like atomic size, you know, that is
[00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:46.240]   going to be, because they went to one child, they can't get people to start having kids again,
[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:50.560]   you know, and they, and they're, you know, they can't restart that system and it is, you know,
[00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:54.720]   they're going to, they're becoming extremely top-heavy. So it is, they're not in a stable place and
[00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:59.680]   it's not a good place for a company to be, for Apple or anybody else to have 95% of their
[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:04.400]   production in China would made sense 10 years ago, made sense five years ago, does not make sense
[00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:07.360]   anymore. And they, and although as, as, as,
[00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:13.200]   slowly Ben points out China has unlimited money and infinite motors motivation to figure this out.
[00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:18.640]   For instance, they can throw money at it because one of the issues with chip production is yield,
[00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:23.600]   right? They don't have to worry if they've got a low yield that just make more of them, right?
[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:29.360]   Things like that. Maybe, maybe. I don't know. They don't have the technology. And that was a big
[00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:35.280]   part of getting TSMC down to those smaller, you know, five, seven, five and three nanometer.
[00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:42.800]   And not all of its brute force. Like, it's not like, no, brute force and high loss may not,
[00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:48.320]   may not be enough to, to, to, to turn the corner there. And so there, you know, they've got a lot of,
[00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:52.720]   China's got a lot of trouble coming in the next decade. And so it's just, but that's bad
[00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:58.160]   for anyone. Right. Because trouble, trouble means president, she has to start shaking the tree
[00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:05.040]   instability. Yep. Yeah. Well, this isn't a geopolitical podcast. I'm sure there are others who will do
[00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:09.680]   a better job. It's an Apple podcast. So, but it turns into geopolitics very, very easily. Yeah,
[00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:15.280]   because when you, whenever you're talking about a tech company with the reach of Apple or Microsoft
[00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:20.000]   or Google, it doesn't take long before you find out that you think that the simplest thing they
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   decide to do can move mountains, even even let's not get into the rat hole of, of Elon Musk's
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:32.240]   acquisition of Twitter. But one of the one of the 10 Titanic things about this is how does this
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:36.480]   affect so how does this affect the world's richest man who wants to continue to be the world's
[00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:43.760]   richest man who now has a fully armed and operational battle station for propaganda for any government
[00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:49.760]   that he wants to do business with? It's like, Oh, dear. Remember, remember, remember, we would
[00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:54.880]   have long, long and let's just arguments about, yeah, but you know, I think that go, I don't think
[00:23:54.880 --> 00:24:01.360]   anybody needs a five megapixel camera on an iPhone. I mean, if you do the, I'm glad that there was
[00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:05.200]   a time we didn't really have to think that much about human rights. And now we really do have to
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:11.360]   an interesting battle speaking of that last night because we had a blood moon event. We had a lunar
[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:17.120]   eclipse and there was a battle, I think, in many social networks between iPhone and pixel seven
[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:22.880]   photos of the eclipse. I think the pixel seven one, I hate to say it, but it was close. It was
[00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:29.040]   definitely close. Let's take a little break. Andy Enoco, Alex Lindsey, Jason Snow, thrilled to have
[00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:34.240]   you guys here. As always for Mac break weekly and all of you are showed today brought to you by
[00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:44.240]   Colide for teams who use slack. Colide is the best way to get your IT in order. I think IT
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:49.920]   admins, I know, I know a lot of them. A lot of you are in IT and that you probably know this
[00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:55.840]   syndrome. You feel like, you know, we have to, we have to tighten all the nuts down. We got to
[00:24:55.840 --> 00:25:03.920]   baton all the hatches. You know, we're going to put crazy glue in the USB ports. But we also have
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:10.960]   to protect performance and employees for privacy. And you're too, you're caught between a rock
[00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:16.400]   and a hard place. You got to turn your, you know, safeguard your company data against hacks and
[00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:21.920]   breaches, but you can't turn your workplace into 1984. And I think sometimes users really feel
[00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:26.960]   that way with traditional MDMs because then the IT team has complete access and control over
[00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:33.680]   company devices, perfectly legal and reasonable. But here's the problem. Employees get frustrated.
[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:42.400]   So they instead of using their work machines, start using their private machines and they
[00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:49.280]   bring them into the office, the BYOD big time. Or if they continue to use their work laptops
[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:53.920]   for personal activities, then there's a huge privacy concern there. Because suddenly you have
[00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:58.960]   access to their photos and their browser history. Before you know it, your end users are complaining
[00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:03.600]   about all the security agents slowing down their laptops developers are, you know, because these
[00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:08.480]   guys, you know, the engineers are frustrated by the lack of autonomy. They know there's a better way.
[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:12.720]   People start secretly working on their personal devices just to get things done in the state
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:17.760]   private. It's easy to fall into the trap of top down security. But Coline wants you to know it's
[00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:24.320]   not the only option. Colide K-O-L-I-D-E is an endpoint security solution built around honest
[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:31.600]   security. And I love this philosophy. Employees aren't your biggest security risk. They're your
[00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:37.440]   biggest allies. But you have to turn them into allies, right? And you do that by having a
[00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:43.200]   relationship based on transparency and informed consent and enrolling them in effect in being
[00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:48.240]   your allies saying, you know what, we're all in this together. We want to keep the company data
[00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:53.440]   secure and private want to keep our network secure. And it takes all of us to do that.
[00:26:53.440 --> 00:27:00.400]   Colide works by notifying your employees of security issues via Slack. So if you're a house
[00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:06.080]   that uses Slack as we are, this is great. It educates them on why, you know, why you need to do this.
[00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:10.480]   It'll give them step by step instructions on how to resolve the problems themselves. In fact,
[00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:17.760]   it all starts. The relationship starts with a Slack DM saying, hey, I'm Coline. Let's get this
[00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:24.240]   installed together. So it's it's teamwork from the very, very start. For IT and security teams,
[00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:28.080]   you're going to love Colide because you get the total visibility and it's completely cross
[00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:34.080]   platform, Mac, Windows and Linux devices. It actually can address high risk issues that you
[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:39.520]   can't really solve through brute force or automation because you're and now your end users are helping.
[00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:44.160]   And they can see exactly why and how every piece of data is being collected because
[00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:51.280]   Colide has a user privacy center and an open source code base. So everybody wins in this scenario.

[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:33.840]   Thank you, Colide, for supporting Macbreak. Weekly. Of course, the other big story of the week is Apple
[00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:41.840]   and Ads. And we talked last week about the gambling ads and Apple's decision to put a
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:49.360]   halt on that. Now 9 to 5 Mac reports Apple is building an advertising network for live television.
[00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:56.480]   This is part of the Major League soccer deal. So it looks like they're going to be selling ads
[00:28:56.480 --> 00:29:02.880]   into the soccer games, the football games, pardon me, the European football games.
[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:08.320]   But it's American, so it's soccer. Major League soccer. We call it soccer.
[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:14.080]   Must be offensive to the ear to people around the world who call it football.
[00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:17.840]   They need to quiet down because soccer is a term invented in England.
[00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:22.880]   Really? To association football. Soccer is short for association football. It's an English term.
[00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:26.960]   And they like to get Americans with it and say, "Oh, soccer is cool. Football is like,
[00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:32.320]   well, we've got our own football. So to differentiate, we use a different European soccer term that
[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:39.120]   you invented, by the way, sir, with your top hat and your monocle. And we'll call it soccer in
[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:44.880]   America. Okay? So that's just how it has to be. The proper response to any gaff like that is
[00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:49.520]   that yeah. And you stole like three cores of the stuff in the British Museum. Give the
[00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:55.120]   Elgin marbles back and then we'll talk about soccer versus football. Apple has a 10-year deal,
[00:29:55.120 --> 00:30:00.400]   as you know, with the Major League soccer MLS. And by the way, you'll have to sign up for a
[00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:05.840]   separate subscription to watch those games. It's complicated. It's complicated, right? They're
[00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:10.240]   going to make some of them available for free and you don't even need to be a TV+ person.
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:14.480]   They're going to be make more games available for TV+ subscribers. But if you want
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:20.320]   all of the games, you have to buy basically an annual pass to see all the MLS games. So it's
[00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:25.520]   this weird kind of multiple tiers and then they're going to produce the games with MLS. And unlike
[00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:32.000]   Major League Baseball, where that deal MLB network, their cable network produced and sold the ads
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:37.680]   for that for the for those games for MLS, it looks like Apple wants to sell the ads themselves,
[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:43.120]   which brings us to this story. Three tiers, by the way, we have ads, even if you're paying for
[00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:47.840]   Major League soccer, you're still going to get some ads. And the name Todd Tiresi, once again,
[00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:54.640]   Surfaces. He's like a money man. He is the company's vice president of advertising platforms.
[00:30:54.640 --> 00:31:02.560]   And he's been in the hot seat for the last few weeks. So Apple's reaching out to advertisers.
[00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:07.520]   They're going to do it themselves. Is that a problem? I don't think so. I mean, one of the
[00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:13.600]   things about soccer is you can't really have ads in the middle of the game. You got to wait. And
[00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:19.200]   it's not like football where there's a pause every five seconds, right? Or baseball or baseball,
[00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:22.640]   you're plenty of room for ads in football and baseball, which is, I think, why they thrived on
[00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:30.000]   our shorts, to be honest. Meanwhile, F1 racing and soccer, those international sports, there's
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.560]   no room for an ad. What do they, how do they, who made these rules up? I think that I think
[00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:39.200]   there's a couple of places that you can put ads. One is if you, you can put them in the graphics.
[00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:43.600]   That's what they do, right? Yeah. And they also in soccer, they put them, they replace the
[00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:50.000]   LEDs that are in the background with, you know, they have that tool has been, man, I saw them demo.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.080]   It's not green screen, right? But it's some way, no, no, this is smart replacement. Yeah,
[00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:58.640]   they're keying stuff in. And what they do is they have to, they have to figure out what the
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:02.800]   camera has to be calibrated to the field. The cameras that do it are calibrated to the field.
[00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:06.160]   So it has a 3D representation and knows where it is and so on and so forth.
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:11.440]   And there will be an ad. So the camera can move and the ads don't move the ad hand until weirdly.
[00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:16.640]   Pan and tilt, except for, I mean, there are a couple cameras, I think that you get to
[00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:22.000]   lemon tree data, like a spider cam. You can get telemetry data from the cable cam.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.920]   But generally it's fixed cameras doing pan and tilt, which is a lot easier to do.
[00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:30.640]   And so anyway, you can, but that's how, and it's the similar technology to how they're putting in the,
[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:34.640]   you know, first down markers on foot, on American football. But they, but they've been doing those
[00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:38.640]   replacements for a long time. And it was a big, it's been a big, you know, people get upset about it
[00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:44.560]   because people sponsored for a long time, people sponsored those LEDs that went along there to
[00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:48.320]   get the broadcast. And then the broadcast took it away. They were like, well, we don't get any
[00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:51.440]   money from that. So we're not going to, we're not going to, you know, we'll just replace it. And so,
[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:55.520]   and you see that in baseball as well in the background, but, you know, behind the batter,
[00:32:55.520 --> 00:33:00.560]   those places. So they insert a lot of those things into those. Hopefully, Apple won't
[00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:04.720]   be as garish as a lot of folks are with those. But who knows with this? I mean, I'd feel like
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:10.960]   Apple doing ads is garish. So. Well, but that, but that if it does show something that they could
[00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:17.280]   do very, very well, they, they, they would not want to get involved in deciding who gets to do
[00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:24.880]   NFL or MLB style ads where again, now, and now here's, and now here's a very, very shady ad for,
[00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:30.960]   for an investment firm. But the idea of having a, having a tiled interface where you have the,
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:35.360]   the live game, but you also have a tile where you're inserting ads, that's something that Apple
[00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:41.120]   could do very, very well through Apple TV and through the Apple TV plus app. They could even,
[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:49.280]   we could also start to see where the line is between Apple not being involved in a filthy business
[00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:54.800]   because they're principled and Apple not being involved in a filthy business simply because
[00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:59.760]   they can't compete and they know they can't compete and they don't have a platform in which they can
[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:05.760]   compete. Meaning that if they, if they had a, if they had a way to do AdSense like with Google,
[00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:11.360]   the way that it could actually compete with Google and someone showed Tim Cook the, the, the,
[00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:15.280]   the spreadsheets and the charts that said that here's how much, here's, here's how many tens of
[00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:20.720]   billions of dollars we would be clearing within the first three years. How principled would that
[00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:26.160]   stance be? So if Apple size to create their own ad network, are they going to create the warm and
[00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:30.640]   fuzzy, hippie, crunchy version of it that says, yes, it's ads, but it's nothing bad about ads.
[00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:34.000]   We're not tracking information. We're not tailoring things specifically to people.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.400]   Or are they going to simply say, well, great. Now we have a swimming pool full of cash. It's
[00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:44.480]   time to put on our speedos and dive right the hell in. It's, you know, everybody, look, everybody's
[00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:49.600]   doing ads. I have YouTube TV. Maybe not doing ads quite that well, but I watch on YouTube TV.
[00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:56.080]   I'll be watching the World Series or whatever. And where the cable, you know, the network show will
[00:34:56.080 --> 00:35:01.520]   go to local ads, you know, for our local casino and the plumber down the street.
[00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:08.000]   YouTube TV often doesn't have anything to put there. So they put like bears in a field and they say,
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:12.960]   enjoy this moment of quiet. Like, wow, it's, it's, it's, it's kind of pathetic.
[00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:19.120]   I have a Fubo TV and they are do they do geo targeting. I end up with a target.
[00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:24.960]   My local cable company knows exactly where I live, right? And they sell ads in the, in the county
[00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:31.200]   region. Fubo is close enough, right? Like they'll do targeted Bay Area ads that they'll roll in there.
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:35.360]   And that that means I guess they're using a better ad network than YouTube TV that really
[00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:39.120]   really enjoy this moment. How is that possible?
[00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:43.920]   They have birds singing and stuff. I know you'd think they'd be really good at this.
[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:47.680]   And I'm sure Google thought they would be really good. Microsoft is now putting ads in
[00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:52.640]   Windows much to the consternation of Windows users. In fact, somebody just pointed out,
[00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:57.680]   you're now going to add when you shut down. So it's like, you can't escape. There's nowhere
[00:35:57.680 --> 00:36:02.240]   and I think that nowhere to go. The thing that's going to happen is as everyone just keeps on
[00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:06.400]   trying to add more and more and more ads, people are going to get more and more upset about it.
[00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:13.120]   So you know, and the, what's funny is like for a lot of people, the only thing they watch in
[00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:17.360]   the Super Bowl is ads. Like if the Steelers aren't playing for me, all I care about is the
[00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:21.760]   thing is you're getting the Super Bowl for free. Well, you're not really, you could be if you're
[00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:25.760]   watching broadcast, but you're, you know, the kind of the feeling is, well, I'm getting this for free.
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:29.920]   So I don't mind an ad. You're getting Twitter, Mac break weekly and all these shows for free.
[00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:35.040]   So I don't, you know, that's how they, that's how they pay for it. But when you're paying for a
[00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:39.120]   service and it gives you time to go to the bathroom, I guess.
[00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:42.880]   Yeah, you get another beer, get a stock, you know, like, like when there's no, when there's no,
[00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:48.960]   that's what I had. That's the problem with foot soccer and F1. You can never go to the bathroom.
[00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:56.080]   I always, I always watch it on delay. That's why. So you're not alone. Basic apple guy
[00:36:56.080 --> 00:37:01.120]   at basic apple guy.com. I don't know who this guy is. You guys do. He's good. He's funny.
[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:07.440]   He, he's bitching about ads and made some sample ads for products of his own in the app store like,
[00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:15.920]   I am rich. If you buy this app, $999.99 cents. Clipart casino, bad graphics, but good dopamine rush.
[00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:23.680]   Black mirror casino, play stupid games, win stupid prizes and Ghostbusters, a dating site for
[00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:31.120]   people who have been ghosted. But he, it's all in a way of shiny gem fun time. It's not gambling.
[00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:40.480]   If it's gems, right? Spreadsheets equals some you and me all. But he is actually with all this humor
[00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:48.400]   in their spurs talking about the problem of this. And apple is now worth more this week.
[00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:56.320]   Apple's stock was successful enough to make it worth more than meta Google and Amazon combined.
[00:37:56.320 --> 00:38:03.520]   Meta Google and Amazon combined. If you ask somebody, if you walk down the street and you said,
[00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:06.960]   what's the most valuable company out there? They might start with Amazon, maybe then Google,
[00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:13.360]   maybe then Apple, meta obviously is worthless now. So, but, but Apple's worth more than all three
[00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:18.320]   combined. Yeah. To be fair, Apple had some help from Mark Zuckerberg on that one.
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:25.040]   Yes. No, I agree. You could take meta out of the equation at this point. But the point being,
[00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:32.160]   they have enough money. Do they really need to be dipping into this sewer, sewage stream?
[00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:37.200]   And I think that that's the problem is really that it just takes some of the sheen off of a very
[00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:43.840]   shiny logo. You know, like, and you're just, you don't need to do that. Like you're making a
[00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:48.720]   lot of money. And, you know, I think that it's, you know, I would keep on building up the services,
[00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:52.400]   keep on building up the, you know, they're doing a lot of things that work really well.
[00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:57.760]   And it just feels like an, I just keep feeling like it's an unforced error, you know, to go down
[00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:03.280]   this path. And we've said this before. This is the quote from basic apple guy in the pursuit of
[00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:08.480]   more ad revenue. He's kind of echoing Marco Armin in this ad has inflicted damage to one of
[00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:14.080]   its core values. I'm sorry, Apple, but great products don't come plastered with giant ads
[00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:18.320]   for cheese, jingles and hookup apps. There's a lot of goodwill to be lost in the relentless
[00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:23.680]   pursuit of more ad revenue. And I just hope the company have long admired, realizes that before
[00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:28.480]   it's too late. I think we all agree on that. Yeah. I think, I think the TV thing, I mean,
[00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:33.040]   honestly, ads during televised sports is one of those things that I don't think is a big deal. I
[00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:38.240]   think it's much more to start talking about placing ads in Apple Maps or wherever else, right? Like,
[00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:44.640]   I think there are more and less natural places, although I do wonder if they do an, if they do a
[00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:51.280]   free tier of Apple TV plus with ads, which is probably going to come at that point. Then if I pay
[00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:55.920]   for the no ad tier, are they still going to try to slide all these ads past me? I assume they are
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:40:00.640]   for like soccer. And I don't, I don't like that idea, but there are places I think that are,
[00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:04.480]   like, I'm not one of those people is like, I'm just allergic to ads. I never want to see an ad
[00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:10.400]   anywhere. Like some ads are fine and ads in general, it is this corrosion of like inserting ads where
[00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:16.000]   you're crowding out, like, like when between football plays or even, you know, on soccer matches at
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:23.360]   halftime, I'm not missing anything. No, that's fine. And you paid a lot of money for the MLS
[00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:28.240]   rights. I'm okay with that. But on their user interfaces, when they're literally pushing things
[00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:34.640]   that you want to see out in order to do something kind of gross that you probably don't want to see
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:40.240]   and get it in your face, that's where it becomes really corrosive to the product. And, and I feel
[00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:44.720]   like, and I know we talked about this last week, but like, I get this gut feeling that whoever,
[00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:50.160]   there's nobody there to look at the big picture and say, we need to turn away some incremental
[00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:54.960]   revenue because the in the long run, it hurts our product and our brand. It seems like everybody's
[00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:59.520]   just like, Hey, if you can make more money, Todd, bring it, do whatever you need to.
[00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:05.440]   Here's a screen grab from a basic apple guy of the stocks app. And you're, you know, you're looking
[00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:11.600]   at all this red. And, and in some of its apple, yeah, stocks going down in the middle of it, a
[00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:19.360]   giant display ad for a Canadians crave Armstrong cheese, Armstrong cheesy jingle contest. Tell us
[00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:26.880]   why you love Armstrong cheese and win. And I have to say, when you juxtapose this with apple slips,
[00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:31.360]   even as key banks as sell through remains healthy and apples unionization movement is at risk of
[00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:36.080]   losing momentum. And you see that ad you kind of think, maybe apples in financial trouble, you know,
[00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:39.760]   why are they putting cheesy? Dads in the middle of my stocks app.
[00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:44.240]   And again, I think that the problem really is, is they get apple gets the benefit of the doubt
[00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:47.840]   a lot, except for Andy, Andy doesn't give them the benefit of the doubt. But, but mostly we'll give
[00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:52.800]   them apple the benefit of the doubt a lot of the time like, oh, they're, they're, you know,
[00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:56.000]   their business model is, is to take care of their user. I'm not saying that they're, it's
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:00.240]   altruistic. It's just that that's their business model is privacy and taking care of their users and
[00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:05.600]   so on and so forth. And it just doesn't feel like that's what's happening. And once they, you know,
[00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:11.280]   they say trust, you know, trust arrives on foot and leaves on horseback, you know, and, and they,
[00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:16.160]   they're really getting dangerously close. And I think that they're going to, I think that they,
[00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:19.440]   there's a high probability they go over that where they lose a lot of that trust. And it's very hard
[00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:26.080]   to get back. Yeah. Yeah. And I, it's not so much that I had distrust of apple. It's just that I,
[00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:31.760]   I could ve, I felt as though I could absolutely see how putting that, putting that Johnny, I've
[00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:37.040]   designed aluminium halo over their heads about how we're not like other companies. We're not
[00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:41.120]   blah, blah, blah, blah. How much it's always that question? How much is that? It's because we have
[00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:45.360]   principles and we have lines that we refuse to cross versus we just haven't figured out a way that
[00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:50.960]   we can monetize it that makes sense for us. And so when you do, I, I'm, I'm pretty much on the same
[00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:55.360]   basis as most of the people in this conversation where ads are just something that that in many
[00:42:55.360 --> 00:43:00.320]   cases has to have to happen unless you want to pay $9 subscription fees every single month for
[00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:06.080]   pretty much everything you ever do. And most people do not want to do that. Ads are a fact of life.
[00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:11.600]   And so this, this sort of thing makes it difficult for apple to do ads in a way that is,
[00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:18.240]   that could conceivably be even better and more respectful of people's privacy
[00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:23.280]   than than the way any other ad network can do it. Now we're, we're all face, now we're all here
[00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:26.960]   having a four week conversation about it. What does this mean that apple's considering going
[00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:31.840]   into advertising? Have they, have they lost the faith? No. So this is, this is why you don't put
[00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:36.480]   up big huge banners. Again, advertising yourself with a halo over your head that you yourself
[00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:40.160]   installed and pointing at it saying, Hey, we're not like other people because in the end, you
[00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:44.480]   are two trillion dollar company. Yeah. And they're making premium products, right? That's part of
[00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:49.440]   the story here is the brand. It's a premium brand. It's a clean, well-lided place. It's a nice
[00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:53.360]   place to be. It's nicer than the competition. And when you get to the point where you start
[00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:57.840]   putting ads everywhere, you lose that. And I know, I, you know, there's this concept of like,
[00:43:57.840 --> 00:44:02.560]   well, what if they put the ads there, but you can pay to get rid of them? Well, it's like,
[00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:06.160]   well, that's really chintzy, right? That's like Amazon's Kindle thing where they have ads
[00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:10.320]   unless you pay a little extra. And it's like, I don't like that either. I don't think that sends
[00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:14.720]   the right message to say, you know, if you can afford it, you don't need to see ads. But our
[00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:19.440]   default is that it's going to be junky. Like it really pushes aside the whole brand promise,
[00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:22.560]   I think when you start junking things up like that, I think when you start to have it,
[00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:25.920]   if you have free product and then you're charging for it, I think it makes sense,
[00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:29.280]   you know, then your brain adds against it. You're free product and then you have ads against it.
[00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:33.360]   I think it, I think in some ways people go, Oh, that's what I get. But I will say, as a user,
[00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:40.240]   if I pay for a service, then I get ads. I'm out. The only place that I put up with that is YouTube
[00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:44.000]   TV, you know, is the, because that's my cable. I mean, essentially my cable network.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:48.560]   But that's because, you know, they're, what are they going to put there? They're going to be a
[00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:53.920]   gap, no matter what, because it's live television. So I kind of understand it there. And so, but,
[00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:59.600]   and it's, but I rest of it. Like if I, I think I did Hulu and Hulu started putting ads in,
[00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:02.160]   at some point they were testing it and I was like, well, I'm done with that.
[00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:10.080]   Well, yeah, I do tend to see it as not, not that you have to pay extra, not to have, you know,
[00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:14.240]   I feel as though that's an okay deal. I don't know why Netflix, for instance, is getting
[00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:19.200]   absolutely such vitriolic flow back, but oh, then Netflix promise they never do ads and
[00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:22.720]   how they're doing ads and how I can't use the service anymore. And it's like, no, they're giving
[00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:27.760]   you a cheaper tier because they realize that obviously people are sharing passwords so much.
[00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:32.320]   It's because there are, there are obstacles that maybe we can address by having a lower price tier
[00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:37.200]   of service. And here is one way that we're going to do that. To me, I have actually always been
[00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:41.680]   grateful for Hulu's and other platforms ability. So look, give us a few bucks more a month and
[00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:47.440]   you will never see an ad because I, the reason why the reason why I subscribe to YouTube Red
[00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:52.480]   is that I just never, ever, ever want to see an ad. I will, I will deal with like embedded ads
[00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:56.800]   because I know that I know that these, these creators, this, this is what's helping this creator
[00:45:56.800 --> 00:46:01.040]   make their, make their cause play for Halloween and show me this video of how they made it.
[00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:05.680]   But I just don't want to be given one, two, three, four ads in a row, particularly really,
[00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:11.360]   really tacky ads that make me angry. So it's, it's a hard, it's a hard line to, it's a hard line to
[00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:16.800]   follow. And with Apple, it's also going to be the problem of if we, if we, if I've been trained
[00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:22.880]   since the get go that Apple services are places where I don't see ads, how clear are they going
[00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:26.960]   to have to be that I'm looking at an ad to make sure that I'm not thinking that, oh, well, this is
[00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:32.320]   just an algorithmic suggestion. No, this was something that was actually placed there for, for my eyes to,
[00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:37.520]   to behold, it's, it's a, it's a tough road to go. I don't necessarily blame Apple for getting it to
[00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:42.480]   ads because again, it's, here is a, here's a, I've always subscribed to the big pile of money theory,
[00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:46.480]   which is that if there is a big pile of money on a table and you tell a company that by the way,
[00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:49.840]   there is a big pile of money here and you can take it and there's nothing illegal about it,
[00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:54.000]   they're going to try to take that big pile of money. This is what a business is in business for.
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:58.640]   But again, Apple is going to have to address some realities and do a lot of messaging to make sure
[00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:03.680]   that they're not aligning themselves with the very bastards that they've been beating up every,
[00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:10.160]   every quarter and every year at WWDC. And to be clear, I don't think Apple's giving our information
[00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:15.200]   to advertisers, but I should point out, neither does Google, neither does Meta. That's not how it
[00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:20.480]   works. That's the crown jewels. They don't give those, oh yeah, Leo, he's 66 years old and he lives
[00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:25.120]   in Petaluma. They don't give that information to advertisers. What they tell advertisers is if
[00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:30.880]   you want to reach 66 year old men living in Petaluma, we have 25 of them or whatever. And you can buy
[00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:37.680]   an ad for that. So, and I wouldn't be surprised to see Apple kind of muddy the waters by saying
[00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:42.640]   something like that. Oh, we never give your information to third parties as if that somehow,
[00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:48.800]   you know, make that makes it okay. But you shouldn't be worried about that. That's not the issue at all.
[00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:52.240]   But of course, what you should be worried about is that if even if they're not sharing that
[00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:57.360]   information with side parties, they're still an ad network has to collect that information
[00:47:57.360 --> 00:48:02.640]   somehow. So there has to be a mode in which they are tracking you and identifying you, we
[00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:07.200]   are identifying your movements and trying to figure out what you're interested in, who you are,
[00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:11.600]   and what you're likely going to be interested in the future without even specifically seeing you
[00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:19.520]   do a search in the Apple search bar for hardwood, thousand piece puzzle pieces.
[00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:24.640]   They're this is the seriously, the successful ad networks get that by figuring out that,
[00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:28.400]   oh, you've been listening to Fleetwood, Mcallod. I bet he's I bet they'd be interested in like
[00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:33.760]   timing puzzle. Right. Yeah, and they're very good at that. They've gotten very good at that.
[00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:41.600]   I guess, you know, some of this comes from my wish that we didn't have to fund things with
[00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:48.400]   advertising. I mean, we do. Six colors happens because of advertising. I mean, you may have a
[00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:53.840]   premium subscription product, but we have a premium subscription product chief of the club,
[00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:58.240]   to it and yeah, I make more money, I think, from the subscription product than I do from the ads at
[00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:02.480]   this point. That happened very quickly because the ads kind of went away and though they're back
[00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:07.520]   now, but it's not the same. But yeah, it is. That's the truth of it. And so the question is,
[00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:11.120]   how do you build a product? It does seem we'll feel like when we're going to streaming,
[00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:15.680]   right? All the streaming services, it feels like this is just the new model is in a lot of places,
[00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:22.880]   you can take a discount, essentially, in C ads or you can pay extra to not see them. And my
[00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:29.600]   understanding is that they make that in many cases, they make more money from the user who's
[00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:33.760]   paying extra than they do from the users who are seeing ads. And as long as that's the case,
[00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:38.160]   companies will be more motivated to do that. But you know, if that were the case here, I would
[00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:44.080]   not have ads. I mean, we just we don't the club as as wonderful as the club is and as active as
[00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:50.560]   our members are, they don't really cover anywhere near the the the nut. We have a three and a half
[00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:55.120]   million dollar a year and not. There's no way they're covered. And not and your whole audience
[00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:58.960]   isn't going to pay. That's the other part of it. Yeah, it's a fraction of the premium model,
[00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:04.320]   right? That's which which is, you know, we give it away with ads. And if you want to pay to not see
[00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:09.120]   the ads, you can do that too. And it's not a bad it's not a bad model. It's just, you know,
[00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:12.320]   it depends on what your product is. Every product is different. When I started that work,
[00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:17.600]   I really wanted it to be a customer. I didn't want to do ads for three years. I resisted.
[00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:24.480]   And it's just grow without the ads. It's also a scalability issue for streaming companies,
[00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:31.120]   because you know, I can like the problem you end up with for a lot of streaming is that I
[00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:35.200]   getting eight dollars a month from you or $20 a month from your $15 a month from you, I don't get
[00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:39.680]   more money because you watched it more. It just eats, you know, bits aren't free. Those bits that
[00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:46.320]   take the video from their server to your house. There are tolls on the way there. And if we start
[00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:52.160]   to push that, you know, so one of the advantages of advertising admittedly is that is that you are,
[00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:56.640]   if you're generating revenue from the content that goes out, so it's cash positive and gets to the
[00:50:56.640 --> 00:51:02.560]   person, you're hoping that you're making money on their interaction with that, those bits,
[00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:07.680]   as opposed to it being a flat fee, you know, because it is, it's not a significant number
[00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:12.480]   per minute, but it adds up. We have hundreds of millions of people watching.
[00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:15.680]   I think maybe Lisa has she's super smart, but I don't think we've calculated
[00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:25.120]   the seven bucks a month versus the ad revenue we get. Like, are we replacing, if you pay me seven
[00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:30.480]   bucks and of course, Patreon takes a couple of them. But so let's say we make five bucks a user.
[00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:35.840]   Are you worth five bucks to the ad in our ad supported network? And I don't, I mean, I figure
[00:51:35.840 --> 00:51:41.120]   it's probably something like that. But it's, I don't know. I really don't know. And you're right. And
[00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:46.880]   then the, you know, if you watch every single one of our shows, the model for the model for
[00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:54.080]   broadcasting is more like magazines than it is the model for broadcasting broadcasting.
[00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:58.480]   A broadcaster puts out a signal in the old days. Right. And it doesn't matter how many people
[00:51:58.480 --> 00:52:04.960]   listen. It doesn't cost them more. Every single download costs money. So it's a complicated
[00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:09.440]   equation to be honest. Thank God. I have somebody who knows spreadsheets.
[00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:16.480]   Me too. Oh man. I'd hate to have to figure this out. I do know. I mean, one of the things that
[00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:20.960]   we're coming up against is a big crunch for next year. We don't, I don't think we will be able to
[00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:27.120]   cover our expenses. And there's no magical pot of gold that we can pull, pull the expenses from.
[00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:33.680]   So, you know, I mean, I think of the best and the best, I'm, what I'm looking a little bit,
[00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:38.400]   what's really interesting happening right now in front of our eyes is this, what's this
[00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:43.760]   problem, this dumpster file that's going on at Twitter and the mass migration, more than a million
[00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:49.520]   people have left Twitter to go to Mastodon, which is a, an un, there's no ad support. It's, it's a,
[00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:56.320]   it's a distributed social network. We have one to it social, which until this migration
[00:52:56.320 --> 00:53:02.720]   cost me 15 euros a month. So it's not then right now I have to pay at least 100 bucks a month. And
[00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:08.320]   as if it continues, I'm going to have to pay more and more and more. And yet I think it's superior
[00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:14.720]   in every respect to Twitter because it is ad free. And it's kind of locally moderated. So it has a
[00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:20.480]   local, more local tone to it and things like that. And I'm thinking, wouldn't it be nice if we could
[00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:29.680]   just do everything that way, you know, but even Microsoft feels like, like Apple, like every other
[00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:35.440]   tech company, we got to supplement our income with ads. Yeah. Is that cool? Or is that necessary?
[00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:42.000]   It's, it's necessary. It wasn't, it's within living memory, certainly that the big question was,
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:47.520]   oh my God, Apple, you're having so much success with the iPhone. But if they're, they're again,
[00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:55.360]   Blackberry was a huge, was a huge manufacturer until they got tanked. Nokia was a huge manufacturer
[00:53:55.360 --> 00:53:59.360]   until they got tanked. What happens if someone comes along and tanks the iPhone business,
[00:53:59.360 --> 00:54:04.320]   the, the ability of Apple to do exactly what they want to do, including work on self driving cars,
[00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:08.960]   including work on VR AR headsets is based on their ability to simply tell stockholders,
[00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:12.800]   hey, if you don't like what we're doing, sell your stock. I'm sure there will buy it from you when
[00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:17.600]   there are people who will buy it as well. And so if they, if they leave money on the table,
[00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:21.520]   when they're trying to transact at that, at the level in which they're trying to transact,
[00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:27.200]   that's almost wrong for them to do. It'd be wrong if they did it in a very unethical and
[00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:32.000]   skeevy way. But I don't begrudge them for saying, look, here is a way we can make tens of billions
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:36.320]   of dollars by simply walking up to this table with an empty pillowcase and a rake. Yeah.
[00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:42.880]   It's a very, I feel like we're going through an interesting, well, in many, many, many ways,
[00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:51.840]   an interesting, you know, kind of juncture in, in history. The internet has clearly mixed everything
[00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:56.720]   up. And, and I think Apple is probably like every company just trying to figure out,
[00:54:56.720 --> 00:55:01.600]   why do they raise the costs a few bucks on Apple one and things like that? Not because it,
[00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:07.440]   is it because it costs them more? It is two things, right? The TV is, they say it's because
[00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:11.600]   they're spending more money on TV output. So they want to make more money there to fund that.
[00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:17.440]   For music, they say that it's entirely that the licensing went up. And so the labels
[00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:21.760]   want more money. And the way they say that it's hilarious, they basically are like, yeah,
[00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:26.000]   we got to pay the labels money. But at least some of that goes to the artists. But for the TV,
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:30.080]   it's just they're spending a lot of money on TV. And they, they, I, and they intentionally
[00:55:30.080 --> 00:55:33.360]   underpriced it, right? Because they were going to launch with very little content and they've got
[00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:37.200]   more now and they've got aspirations. So they're spending more. Part of the problem is,
[00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:43.280]   it's opaque. So, and that's the whole problem with inflation is, is, you know, who's, who's
[00:55:43.280 --> 00:55:48.080]   raising prices? Because they can, who's raising prices? Because they have to. And it's not,
[00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:52.480]   it's a completely opaque. We just don't know. We just don't know. And then so then that lends
[00:55:52.480 --> 00:56:00.720]   your mind to wander. Hey, here's an interesting email thread. This comes from a Twitter account
[00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:08.160]   called internal tech emails, a battle between Eddie Q, Phil Schiller and Craig Federighi over
[00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:13.280]   the direction of messages on Android. Now I should point out this is nine years ago.
[00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:20.560]   Eddie, and I, I'm, I am presuming that these are genuine. They come from, according to this
[00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:26.240]   Twitter account from Discovery in, you know, a variety of trials and it kind of makes sense.
[00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:33.760]   Eddie Q wrote, we really need to bring a message to Android. This is because of a rumor published
[00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:39.200]   in Apple Insider that Google is going to buy WhatsApp. I have had a couple of people investigating
[00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:44.880]   this, but we should go full speed and make this an official product. Google will instantly own
[00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:51.520]   messages with this acquisition. It's actually makes me wonder why Google didn't buy WhatsApp
[00:56:51.520 --> 00:56:58.080]   because Google has basically seeded the messaging world to a bunch of crap. To which,
[00:56:58.080 --> 00:57:05.360]   let's see what's, let's see. The first message is 908 PM. You know, these guys have a work ethic.
[00:57:05.360 --> 00:57:12.160]   To which 18 minutes, 28 minutes later, Phil Schiller replies, and since we make no money on
[00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:18.480]   iMessage, what will be the point? To which Eddie responds half an hour after that,
[00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:23.520]   do we want to lose one of the most important apps in a mobile environment to Google?
[00:57:23.520 --> 00:57:28.560]   They have search, mail, free video, growing quickly in browsers. Yes, they now dominate.
[00:57:28.560 --> 00:57:33.520]   We have the best messaging app and we should make it the industry standard. Like, you know,
[00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:38.640]   I kind of agree. I don't know what ways we can monetize it, but it doesn't cost us a lot to run.
[00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:45.360]   Who are you rooting for at this point? Eddie or Phil? I'm rooting for Eddie. To which
[00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:51.920]   Craig Federighi the next morning at 7 AM pipes in. Do you have any thoughts about how we would make
[00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:57.440]   switching to iMessage from WhatsApp compelling to masses of Android users who don't have a bunch
[00:57:57.440 --> 00:58:04.320]   of iOS friends? iMessage is a nice app service, but to get users to switch social networks,
[00:58:04.320 --> 00:58:09.360]   we'd need more than a marginally better app. That's why Google's willing to pay a billion dollars
[00:58:09.360 --> 00:58:15.040]   for the network, not for the app. That's a very good point. In absence of a strategy to become the
[00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:22.800]   primary messaging service for a bulk of cell phone users, I am concerned the iMessage on Android
[00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:29.360]   would simply serve to remove an obstacle to iPhone families, giving their kids Android phones.
[00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:35.440]   We saw this now kind of validates this because we did see that last sentence all over the news
[00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:41.520]   when it came out in the battle with Epic. Now we see the context of it. What do you think?
[00:58:43.040 --> 00:58:49.360]   I don't blame Apple for not doing an iMessage client. It would be an immense amount of work
[00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:56.000]   and a massive amount of support. As they said in the thread, how do we monetize this? How do we
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:59:01.840]   support all these users? We remember that Android is actually the lion's share of the mobile market.
[00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:08.400]   We won't get into the argument again. I just wish that the Apple would take more steps to make
[00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:16.720]   the conversations between iPhone users and Android users much better and much richer, much more safe,
[00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:21.600]   better pictures, better videos, better everything. I think they could do that
[00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:29.200]   by simply switching from, without having to switch to messages from Google.
[00:59:29.200 --> 00:59:34.240]   But simply they say, "Look, right now our fallback when you're not talking to an iMessage user
[00:59:34.240 --> 00:59:38.960]   is SMS. Now we're going to use RCS. And if RCS is there, then we switch back to SMS."
[00:59:38.960 --> 00:59:44.800]   But yeah, it would have been a great thing. I think that if they knew exactly what a hash
[00:59:44.800 --> 00:59:49.040]   that Google was going to make out of messaging over the next six years, it would have aligned.
[00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:56.960]   Exactly. I mean, honestly, officially Hangouts was killed. It was already announced, was officially
[00:59:56.960 --> 01:00:01.920]   killed. And I've always remembered myself that every time that Google cancels another messaging
[01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:06.080]   platform, it's time for me to check the batteries of my smoke detectors. So there was something good
[01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:11.520]   that comes out of that indecision. But I'm okay with them not having an iMessage compatible app.
[01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:15.600]   I just think that there are a few excuses for them not supporting an open standard that
[01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:20.000]   yes, one that Google has provided, but one that will actually make a better experience between
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:24.320]   their iPhone users and their and the Android community. Alex thoughts on that email exchange?
[01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:33.120]   I guess I would say that you just saw the context of them thinking through that process. I think
[01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:40.960]   that that email or that one comment at the end makes much more sense and is less powerful
[01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:47.200]   in context of the conversation. So I think that I think it stood out a lot when it was just cut
[01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:52.800]   out. And that's what all you saw when you see the overall conversation. It is just one comment
[01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:57.040]   in a lot of reasonable things. I think that iMessage would be really hard for Apple to...
[01:00:57.040 --> 01:01:03.600]   I think it has the most to do with just innovation. The reason Apple can build an M1
[01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:09.600]   is because they own everything. And the reason Intel will have a hard time
[01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:14.080]   is because they don't own everything. And so if you want to keep on moving a technology forward,
[01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:21.760]   if you're small, you can't do what Apple's doing because you can't grab on. No one's going to pay
[01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:26.560]   attention to you. But once you're big, there's a lot of advantages to being by yourself and not
[01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:30.240]   having to deal with other people's needs and other what other people want to do with your product
[01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:34.000]   and being able to have all your teams just work together and make all of those things integrate,
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:38.640]   especially if, "Oh, we want to put AR into this. We want to put this into this." And just say,
[01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:43.600]   "Listen, we're going to focus 100% on this. The other stuff is we'll send you texts."
[01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:52.560]   And we got that working. But them, with no company, is it unlimited resources. There are a
[01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:57.840]   certain number of really good programmers that are out there. And so where are they going to put
[01:01:57.840 --> 01:02:01.840]   those folks to handle all of those problems? And you hear all the time about companies taking this
[01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:05.600]   team and moving them over here because they needed to get something fixed. That tells you
[01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:12.480]   that it's not just about available people. They have to find the right people to do that. And so I
[01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:17.760]   think that I don't think Apple would make any more money with it. I don't think that they would
[01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:23.520]   not be able to innovate the way that they want to. And so I think that it makes sense for Apple to
[01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:28.480]   just stick with building for their own platforms. I mean, I think as an app, I don't think that
[01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:32.240]   they're users. I think if you ask Apple users, not Android users, but Apple users,
[01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:38.400]   is it important for you for Apple to develop for the Android platform? I would argue probably
[01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:46.480]   somewhere between 90 and 99% would say, "Nope. An Apple is going to look at what 90% of their pop,
[01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:52.960]   what 90% of their audience that wants 90% of the time." And there's no,
[01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:58.640]   I don't know Apple users that, I know a lot of Apple users like me that will text less to people
[01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:04.080]   who have green bubbles because it means it's not on everything. For me, it's like, "Oh, I gotta go
[01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:10.480]   find the phone that is connected to that thing." And so I think that's a little bit of a thing.
[01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:17.200]   But none of us would want to give up forward momentum on any innovation to include the Android
[01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:23.200]   platform. So I think that that's a very small, maybe vocal on Twitter or whatever, but a very,
[01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:31.520]   very tiny percentage of users really care. But how do you feel about support for RCS?
[01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:36.640]   If you ask the Apple users, "Hey, you know how your brother and your aunt, when they send you
[01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:41.760]   pictures, they look like crap compared to the pictures that you get from your sister,
[01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:46.080]   would you like those pictures to be better? Would you like the video they sent you to be better?"
[01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:50.480]   They would probably say, "Yes." And when the answer is, "Well, they Apple could do that without
[01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:55.040]   sacrificing innovation, without having to create a new app." They would absolutely sacrifice
[01:03:55.040 --> 01:04:00.720]   innovation. Absolutely. Anytime you incorporate another platform,
[01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:06.160]   in another protocol, you give up innovation. That is an absolute, I mean,
[01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:11.760]   as someone who's done this many, many times, anytime you add another platform that you have to support,
[01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:14.800]   you're now spending resources on something. Instead of moving forward, you have to go,
[01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:20.960]   "Well, will this product work over here as well as over here?" And so there is,
[01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:26.160]   you would absolutely get it. So the question really is, are you willing to get less out of iMessage
[01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:32.480]   over time because you want to get better photos from your cousin? And the answer again would be
[01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:38.000]   probably, "No. No, no one cares." Apple users don't care about Android users. They just don't care.
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:44.960]   I will say that I'm 100% certain that you're 100% wrong.
[01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:53.120]   We should do a poll sometimes. We should get something about how it would hold back Apple
[01:04:53.120 --> 01:05:00.400]   innovation. The general response I have to things like that are that a company, the scale of Apple,
[01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:05.280]   can do truly whatever it wants to do. Whatever it brings is a priority.
[01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:10.400]   It's not. I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm, I feel as though if they can,
[01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:14.320]   if they can create all these projects and fund all these projects that they're working on right
[01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:19.920]   now that are speculative in nature, some of which have succeeded, some of which we don't have
[01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:23.600]   failed, some of which we don't know whether it's going to succeed or fail, I think that this simple
[01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:28.240]   thing of not only giving a better experience for iPhone users who talk to people who are not
[01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:34.080]   necessarily an iPhone using iPhones and also giving them a more secure experience, I think that that's
[01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:38.400]   absolutely worth it. And the last thing being that I think that I think it's dramatic that you
[01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:44.480]   say that there are people that like it limits your, it limits how much you want to talk to people
[01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:48.640]   who are quote, "grain bubbles" unquote. That is the smoking gun. That is the reason for it.
[01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:53.680]   If I were, if I were higher up at Apple and I, and I were hearing users talk about things like that,
[01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:58.800]   I hear about that a lot, I would say, okay, we at least have to improve this experience for,
[01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:02.320]   for these people to make sure that they are still talking to their whole community of people.
[01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:06.800]   They're, they're, their users aren't clamoring. Like, you know, pure Apple users aren't sitting
[01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:11.040]   at the door clamoring. Like if we only had RCS, I mean, they just, they just don't care. Like they
[01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:16.960]   don't like, you know, most users don't know, which is why they pose it that way though, as a question
[01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:22.160]   about, but it's experience, right? I've worked in, I've worked in so many engineering teams,
[01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:27.600]   and I can just tell you, like, so for instance, I did a lot of stream, I do a lot of streaming,
[01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:32.080]   we added Android and Windows to some of this platform stuff that we were doing. It was like
[01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:36.720]   being thrown into a hot pit of tar. Like, like, like, you know, and so the thing is, is that it is
[01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:41.840]   every time we add a protocol, especially with basically substandard platforms like Android and
[01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:47.120]   Windows, you get, you get thrown into there and all the, all the services, all the services that,
[01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:52.400]   like, because when we built the, when we built the app that I built, the, it was, we built it only
[01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:58.240]   for the Apple platform first, because I just wanted it to work. And three months, it's fine.
[01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:03.280]   It's working perfectly. Everything. And really within the first three weeks, it was working.
[01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:08.880]   And it's very complicated app. We, then we add Android and Windows, and a year later,
[01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:13.600]   it's not, it's not really working. You know, and so the thing is, is that it is, it's just
[01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:18.880]   their, their protocols are just trash. You know, and so the thing is, is that, is the dealing with
[01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:24.560]   their goofiness about how they do those things is so frustrating that I would never, as a user,
[01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:28.880]   knowing what that means on the other side of, of supporting something that Google builds,
[01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:34.000]   I would never touch that. I would never, never, I'd be like, no, no, like any app, I won't build,
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:37.680]   I won't build Android and Windows apps anymore after that experience, because it was just such a
[01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:42.320]   horrible experience, you know? Yeah. Well, just again, we're not talking about building
[01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:46.000]   Android and Windows as we're talking about supporting protocol. And also the thing is that it's not a
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:50.000]   standard. It's not a standard. Look, it's kind of a standard, isn't it? It's a lot of things.
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:55.360]   Yeah. The carrier's now all supported. But the, but the other, but the other thing is that so,
[01:07:55.360 --> 01:08:00.400]   if you were the, if you were in charge of Safari, you'd say that, no, we're not going to support this
[01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:04.880]   protocol for local storage. No, we're not going to support this certificate protocol. We want to
[01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:09.680]   build our own certificate protocol. Like Apple does this all the time on the Safari team, and it
[01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:13.040]   doesn't seem to, the things that are actually back are actually Apple.
[01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:18.640]   Well, the kitty cat principle, the kitty cat principle is that your cat is really nice to you
[01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:22.400]   as long as it's small and you're big. If it was a pig, it would eat you in a heartbeat. You know,
[01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:27.680]   like, you know, and so, the thing is, is that when you're, when you're, when you're, when you're a
[01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:31.440]   little, when you're a little in a market, then you do what you need to do to live in that market.
[01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:35.040]   When you're big in that market, you don't, you only do what you, what you have to do.
[01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:39.920]   Like, you know, it doesn't help you do that process. And so, so that, that also does some
[01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:45.040]   important Apple look good saying if Apple was getting, we care, we care. I'm sorry, I'm interrupting.
[01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:49.200]   Go ahead. Well, I want to interrupt and say, yeah, I think you both have made your points.
[01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:54.880]   Good points. Exactly. We should also mention, by the way, that we're talking about almost entirely
[01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:58.960]   North America centric approach here, because in most of the world, people don't use, yeah,
[01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:02.800]   they don't use I message at all. It's really only in the US where that is taken up at all.
[01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:07.440]   I know I'm going to come in the middle here and say, I think Apple should probably support RCS,
[01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:11.680]   because I think it would make the iPhone user experience better because iPhone users have to
[01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:15.760]   deal with people who have Android phones. And that experience is not very good. And they should
[01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:19.920]   make it a little bit better. It can still be a green bubble. It can still not support all the
[01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:25.280]   features. It can still not sell and say it's as good as I message, but it would be, I would argue
[01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:30.640]   a better user experience for iPhone users to not have quite as much of a mess when they're trying to
[01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:35.520]   do a group conversation. And there are people on there who are using Android phones and all of that.
[01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:40.960]   At the same time, I think Craig Federighi is absolutely right, which is, I message is part
[01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:45.920]   of Apple's lock-in strategy. It is a feature that Apple has built four people in its ecosystem,
[01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:51.120]   two differentiates itself from others. And it worked. And it's not a public utility.
[01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:55.520]   And so I don't think that extending iMessage elsewhere makes any sense. But I do actually
[01:09:55.520 --> 01:10:03.040]   agree with Andy. I think that Apple could make iPhone users lives better by supporting RCS instead
[01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:08.080]   of SMS. Because keep in mind, Apple's already supporting a weird carrier centric.
[01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:14.320]   - SMS is a bad experience. - It's just one from decades ago. They could probably put a little bit
[01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:20.080]   bit of effort in there to make it a little bit better for people who are in these heterogeneous
[01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:26.560]   messaging conversations without undercutting iMessage. - And I will admit, to the point that
[01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:32.080]   was made earlier, my son found, you know, got an Android phone. I got one message from it,
[01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:36.160]   and I bought him an iPhone. - There you go. - No, I don't want that.
[01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:41.680]   - My daughter is 30, so I don't have a choice. - And she will not use iPhones.
[01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:48.080]   And we message almost every day. And for the most part, it's fine, especially now that reactions
[01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:53.360]   get translated properly. And, you know, if I send her a meme emoji, it just shows up on her phone as
[01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:58.080]   an image that I send her. I don't think it's the end of the world. And we have group chats that
[01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:03.360]   she's a part of, and the rest are iPhone users. And it all seems to work. So I don't think it's,
[01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:08.160]   I don't think most users are in a lot of pain, but maybe they are. I don't see why you couldn't
[01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:13.840]   just add RCS. What really gratified me reading that full thread for the first time,
[01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:20.880]   because we kind of saw parts and pieces of it in the spring, is that that discussion is going on
[01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:26.080]   inside Apple. And I think in a civilized and intelligent way. And I understand at EQ saying,
[01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:32.000]   you know, this could be bad if Google buys WhatsApp. It turned out, interestingly,
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:36.640]   meta bought it. I don't know. It wasn't as bad if meta bought it. I don't know. I guess because
[01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:43.200]   Google has the phones. - Right. And I think that a lot of us are using so many messaging apps now.
[01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:48.400]   I think that's the other thing that's going on. I mean, 80%, maybe 90% of my interactions are
[01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:53.120]   in Discord. Like I don't, like I, that's, that's where I have all my messages with my daughter.
[01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:58.480]   We're a problem. We would just move to somewhere. We would move to Telegram or to WhatsApp. And
[01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:04.640]   we haven't. And so my thinking is, I guess it's, it's working fine. It's working. Good enough.
[01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:10.480]   Hey, what about this? Actually, let me take a break. And then I'll ask you,
[01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:14.800]   if we need the word, hey,
[01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:20.640]   it's for horses. Hey, it's for horses, my friend. That's my fourth grade teacher would say.
[01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:28.480]   This show brought to you today by a well rested chief to it because I have my cozy eight sleep.
[01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:34.320]   I tell you, as it gets colder and colder, I am more than I even said this to Lisa last night.
[01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:39.840]   Thank you, eight sleep. Because we had the, it was, it was freezing and we didn't have to turn
[01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:46.960]   the heat on in the house. We just had our eight sleep pod cover on our bed, go up to 10. And we were
[01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:51.440]   toasty warm all night. In fact, I will admit one of the reasons I was late for the show today is
[01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:58.960]   because I didn't want to get out of bed. Cause it was so cozy in there. Eight sleep is awesome.
[01:12:58.960 --> 01:13:05.120]   Cool. When it needed to be cool, warm, when you needed to be warm, it's the only way to make
[01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:11.120]   your bed both warm and cool with the pot cover or by the way, they sell a mattress too. We like
[01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:16.560]   our mattress. So we just, we put the sleep pod on top of it like it's like a fitted sheet. But
[01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:23.440]   then what's cool is it dynamically cools or heats each side of the bed separately to maintain the
[01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:29.120]   optimal sleeping temperature for what your body needs. So you can go as cool as 55 or as hot as
[01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:36.480]   110, both of which are noticeable. Right. But boy, when it was really hot in the summer,
[01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:40.800]   the worst thing in the world is to wake up in the middle of the night, sweating hot and uncomfortable.
[01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:48.640]   Right. In fact, it turns out that is the number one complaint people have in sleeping poorly is
[01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:54.320]   it's too hot. But with eight sleep, it's monitoring the room temperature. It's monitoring you
[01:13:55.440 --> 01:14:00.000]   and how you're tossing and turning or whatever and adjusting the temperature dynamically throughout
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:05.600]   the night. I always start warm. It cools it off as I go into my deepest sleep, which helps me.
[01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:09.600]   Apparently I didn't realize this, but it really helps you sleep more deeply. And then
[01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:14.400]   it's almost an alarm function. I say, okay, I want to wake up at eight 30 and it starts warming it up.
[01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:19.440]   And actually I wake up very naturally. It's warm and it's cozy. This holiday season, give the
[01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:26.080]   never ending gift of better sleep. Consistent good sleep can reduce the likelihood of serious
[01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:32.000]   health issues, decrease the risk of heart disease, lower your blood pressure, even reduce the risk
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:39.760]   of Alzheimer's. And you'll fall asleep in record time because you're so cozy. So comfy clinical
[01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:47.920]   data shows eight sleep users experience 34% more deep sleep. And I will, I will vouch for that.
[01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:53.360]   I know when I've had a good night's sleep and if I look at my eight sleep stats and I see,
[01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:59.360]   oh yeah, you got an hour and a half deep sleep, even 50% more deep sleep makes a huge difference.
[01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:05.760]   I feel like I'm moving better, my physical recovery is better, my hormone regulation,
[01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:11.120]   my mental clarity. It's not a holiday miracle. It sounds like one, this would be a great holiday
[01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:17.680]   gift for your family. If better sleep is on your wish list, look no farther than the new pod
[01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:23.200]   three, they've actually doubled the sensors. So they they they're even more accurate. And I
[01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:30.000]   I mean, especially now that it's getting cold in the winter, cold and damp. And I just, and we don't
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:33.600]   and literally we don't, you know, and I don't like to heat the house at night because then it gets
[01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:37.920]   too hot in the middle of the night, right? It's warm at first, but then it's to this is perfect.
[01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:44.080]   It just does it for you saves me money on on heating the house. I just heat our our comfy bed.
[01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:48.080]   Lisa has a different, you know, she likes it a lot hotter. I have a little, I like it to be a
[01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:51.920]   little cooler, but that's fine. We each get our own settings for a limited time.

[01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:58.400]   She got it at six months later. She told me, oh, you got to get this thing up. I was slow. I
[01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:05.360]   we've had it now for a little more than a year. I, I, when we travel, I go, where's my eight sleep?
[01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:09.120]   You need it. Eight sleep.com slash Mac break. In fact, if the only thing I would say to eight
[01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:14.560]   sleep is can you make a portable one so I can take it to hotels? It would really be nice.
[01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:21.760]   Eight sleep.com slash Mac break. Thank you. Eight sleep for your support of our show.
[01:17:21.760 --> 01:17:26.800]   Tom and our chair, I'm said, but I like the ads you guys do because yeah, we try to pick sponsors
[01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:31.600]   that we use and like and can we always very careful, make sure it's something we can say,
[01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:36.080]   you know, we can recommend. So I guess some ads aren't the end of the world, but yeah,
[01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:39.680]   I want that one now. I went after the show last week and went to the eight sleep websites like,
[01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:44.640]   Oh, tell me more about this. So nice. I am not. This is not me making something up.
[01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:49.360]   Tell Lisa. Tell Lisa that I need one. How about that? Let her know. We all, we all like one.
[01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:55.360]   Chris is present. That's a great idea. I spend this ad like looking at the site.
[01:17:55.360 --> 01:17:58.400]   I know we don't have to share the same bed though. It's going to be what happens.
[01:17:58.400 --> 01:18:03.360]   You see it in a bed. Yeah. I know you guys were going to send you one eight sleep for the three of
[01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:08.800]   you. You can work that out. Yeah. It's a real Charlie on the chocolate factory. Sleep head to
[01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:18.080]   toe. That's all I'm saying. Just sleep. I did. I did. I did. So Mark Gurman says, I don't know.
[01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:25.920]   I don't know. Do I don't know how seriously to take this? Apple is working to remove hay from hay
[01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:31.760]   Siri. I'll solve it. That'll solve. And by the way, they say this might take, it might not
[01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:40.640]   happen next year. Might take till 2024. Well, first of all, what? In fact, you know, can I make a
[01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:46.640]   suggestion? Apple take all that engineering time and make it so that we can have a custom phrase,
[01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:54.800]   which I had on my 2013 Moto X phone because I got to tell you, yeah, series waking up. I watch a show.
[01:18:55.600 --> 01:19:02.640]   I live in a very hostile environment because I have Google assistant Amazon's Echo and Siri.
[01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:09.680]   Oh, and Sonos too. And so there's always some machine talking back to the TV almost all the time.
[01:19:09.680 --> 01:19:13.520]   It's annoying. And then you yell at it and says, what I couldn't hear you. What can I do for you?
[01:19:13.520 --> 01:19:19.440]   What would it? It's like, no. So taking the hay off seems like the wrong direction.
[01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:28.240]   Yeah. On my Moto, I had the wake up was help me Obi-Wan Kenobi. That works great because it was very
[01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:33.920]   rarely heard in real world. Also eight syllables, you know, and AI is not going to mistake that for
[01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:38.800]   anything else. It's it sounds like I'm making a joke. I say, ooh, that's turns from three syllables
[01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:44.640]   into two. But that actually is a very, very significant increase in the problem of separating
[01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:49.920]   an intentional, an intentional command from something that was just part of another word that was
[01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:55.120]   that was said, like a Google, for instance, uses the has been doing a lot of that kind of stuff
[01:19:55.120 --> 01:20:00.640]   in trying to simplify the access to the Google assistant. But a lot of that is powered not just
[01:20:00.640 --> 01:20:06.960]   with AI, but also with here is a smart speaker that can kind of sense if someone is in the room or
[01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:13.920]   not, and sense if they are face if that if the if the source of the of the command is being directed
[01:20:13.920 --> 01:20:19.600]   towards this microphone or not. Oh, it's totally smart about that. In fact, I have to edge towards
[01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:26.400]   the bathroom. If I want the bathroom speaker to respond when I say, Hey, you know who hey, Google,
[01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:32.080]   instead of the bedroom one, because if the bedroom response is not as good as speaker, so I will
[01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:36.800]   actually literally face the other way and take a couple of steps towards the bathroom and say,
[01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:42.560]   no, this one's for you, which is ridiculous. And especially when you consider it's well,
[01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:48.480]   especially when you consider that Apple doesn't let you specify that when I when I when I introduce
[01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:53.760]   a new Google device that's activated for the assistant. And the first time I give it a command,
[01:20:53.760 --> 01:20:58.560]   I will one of my devices, my phone, my whatever will say, Hey, we'll actually say,
[01:20:58.560 --> 01:21:04.400]   did the correct device respond to your command? What should this device be doing? When here's a
[01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:09.840]   command like that, whereas Apple devices don't have that kind of capability. So it becomes it
[01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:14.000]   becomes really, really complicated. I wish them well with it. It's it does make it more personable
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:19.600]   because I don't eat. We joke around like, Hey, as for horses, but it is a subtle thing that we
[01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:28.560]   don't necessarily say. Hey, layout. No, well, no, I have the Amazon Echo. You can have a broad
[01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:34.720]   range of trigger words. It could be echo could be computer. It can be a le X a and you can add
[01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:40.800]   voices. So I have Melissa, I can have a Melissa, I can have a Samuel. So and I can have Ziggy. So
[01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:49.760]   the one in my office is Ziggy. But if I forget, if I don't say, Hey, Siri, it will think Ziggy will
[01:21:49.760 --> 01:21:55.040]   think if I say Ziggy Siri. So sometimes both of them answer because they're so Siri and Ziggy are
[01:21:55.040 --> 01:22:02.000]   so close together. So just make it more customizable. Longer is better. Apple saying, no, no, no,
[01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:08.640]   we don't we want to make it shorter because then it's more efficient. That seems like the wrong.
[01:22:09.920 --> 01:22:13.040]   Am I alone in this? No, I think we'll get a lot more.
[01:22:13.040 --> 01:22:22.560]   Yeah. Yeah. This is this is a correction. Yeah, I mean, we are TV is in the same room as the
[01:22:22.560 --> 01:22:27.120]   as one of the home pods. Yeah, it's not constant, but it is weird. It'll be like, and it's usually
[01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:30.480]   some quiet part of the movie and you're in there and suddenly you're here. I don't understand what
[01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:36.240]   you just. Yeah, my Amazon Echo. My Amazon Echo does that all the time. Yep. And you know, it is
[01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:41.440]   again a three syllable trigger phrase and it does it all the time and it starts talking to itself.
[01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:46.720]   I actually find that the Echo does it more than the home pod does. Well, it did it more than
[01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:53.440]   it's a race because of my name. Oh, God, you can change the thing though. You can change the
[01:22:53.440 --> 01:22:59.280]   wake word in Amazon's ecosystem and you can't say that's a problem. Yeah, Ziggy's good. I like
[01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:04.560]   Ziggy. But again, Ziggy is a long series set up in the next to each other because Ziggy
[01:23:04.560 --> 01:23:14.080]   is used. Yeah, I I feel like I feel like we're going the wrong direction. That's all I can say,
[01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:19.680]   Apple. And I don't know why it takes a year and a half to change it from a to just dropping the
[01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:25.120]   hey, why does that take so long? I do think that's a non trivial problem. I just they say that. I just
[01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:31.760]   hope that this is I just hope that this isn't a case where they they have a long list of priorities
[01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:35.600]   and they could choose chosen any of them. And this is the one they chose to focus on.
[01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:39.200]   I'm sure that's not the situation, but it's like when I think about the complaints that I have
[01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:44.880]   about about slow mo it's never about oh, I just I just I'm by the time I get to the actual command
[01:23:44.880 --> 01:23:50.480]   by after saying three syllables activated my mouth is parched. I lose my brain of thought.
[01:23:50.480 --> 01:23:55.040]   It's like no, it's like please please be smarter. Please don't say when I when I ask you to do
[01:23:55.040 --> 01:23:58.960]   something that you've done like two or three times before here. Here's information about turn
[01:23:58.960 --> 01:24:03.520]   on the bedroom lights from Wikipedia. Like no, that's really now playing turn on the
[01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:08.640]   bedroom lights from fraudulent bands like no, I really think you know what I want you to do.
[01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:17.920]   Yeah, just being she quote the other rumor guys saying now that Apple's VR glasses could be pushed
[01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:26.400]   back to as late as 2025 or 2026 amid design issues. Wow.
[01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:32.880]   Well, I mean, I think isn't the core question of this product always been what is the right
[01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:38.320]   time to the end enter the market? And then I feel like Apple that they have their track records
[01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:42.800]   actually pretty good right where they don't really release a product until they can make an
[01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:46.720]   impact. And one of the rumors has been that this product that's supposed to come next year
[01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:54.480]   is going to cost you know, $2,000, $2,500. And you know, is it going to be good enough?
[01:24:54.480 --> 01:24:59.440]   Is it going to be a real product or is that going to be purely aspirational? And I felt like
[01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:06.080]   in general, Apple doesn't like to release purely apps aspirational products, right? They want to
[01:25:06.080 --> 01:25:11.680]   they want to sell product. They want to send sell millions of products. And this this might
[01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:16.800]   be a positive way to take this is maybe somebody inside Apple finally looked at this product and
[01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:22.240]   said, why are we releasing it now? Our only competition is meta. We've seen meta's thing now.
[01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:27.680]   It's fine. It's not going to change the world. We've got time to make a product that is not
[01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:32.320]   because if they release a product and it's a loser, right? Like, sorry, Newton fans, but like the
[01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:38.320]   new they did it too soon. They did it too soon. And they couldn't come back from it. And I think
[01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:46.160]   that there is a great amount that Apple has historically exercised of self limitation to say,
[01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:51.280]   we're not ready some discipline to say this product is not up to our standards. And if that's what's
[01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:56.560]   happening here, then I say, great, right? Because I don't want that overpriced VR product that is
[01:25:56.560 --> 01:26:02.160]   kind of a loser, you know, Apple devoting time to that, if it's not ready, it shouldn't ship.
[01:26:02.160 --> 01:26:07.520]   And I think that they're still ground to be laid before, you know, groundwork to be laid before the
[01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:12.240]   before you actually put out the device. So one of the big problems that all of these,
[01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:15.840]   that all of the products so far come out is that there just isn't enough content, you know,
[01:26:15.840 --> 01:26:19.760]   and there's not enough to do with it. And I think that, you know, Apple has done pretty good job
[01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:26.320]   with reality, you know, a lot of the reality kits, you know, the converter and the, you know,
[01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:31.200]   and so on and so forth to make that work. But there's a lot more that can be done for, and I still think
[01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:39.360]   that adding USDZ to keynote will make a huge difference in how much content, sheer content,
[01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:44.080]   is available that eventually goes into AR and can go into AR almost immediately. So, you know,
[01:26:44.080 --> 01:26:48.320]   the thing is, is that when keynote and the office apps suddenly have what we already have in
[01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:52.720]   messages, which is I can send you a model, you click on it and immediately shows up at scale,
[01:26:52.720 --> 01:26:59.520]   in front of you, ready to go, you know, that it changes the size of the market that 3D models live
[01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:06.640]   in by 100X. And what suddenly happens, like what we're seeing with spatial audio, when Apple
[01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:12.800]   released spatial audio to music, suddenly everybody is trying to remix all of their albums into
[01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:19.120]   spatial. And, you know, in LA and New York, they're just gangsters. I mean, like, you know, just
[01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:25.360]   it's just going crazy. And so, I've tried to get all of that to capture that market. And if you see
[01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:30.240]   when they add, and the reason you would use the 3D models is you think about all that clip art,
[01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:34.400]   clip art being what if the clip art can be exactly what you want, what if it can rotate around,
[01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:38.320]   what if you can, even if you're not going to use the 3D, you can rotate that phone to be exactly
[01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:41.680]   where you wanted it, you can put something else in the 3D thing and then let it go. And then it's
[01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:46.240]   just in the slide, but it's no longer, you no longer have to find photos on iStock. You know,
[01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:51.040]   you literally have photoreal objects that are that you're putting into your presentations
[01:27:51.040 --> 01:27:54.880]   and into your pages documents and even into numbers. I don't know why you would do that, but
[01:27:54.880 --> 01:28:00.960]   they'll do it all at the same time, I'm sure. But that market suddenly becomes massive and all
[01:28:00.960 --> 01:28:06.880]   these products get made for it, those products happen to be very useful and it helps standardize
[01:28:06.880 --> 01:28:09.840]   the market on 1 3D platform, which would be useful for Apple.
[01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:15.440]   So let me correct myself. It's not Ming Chi Quo. It's Jeff Poo, who's an analyst at High
[01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:21.520]   Tongue International Tech Research. I misquoted. So that was different analysts, same information.
[01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:26.320]   But this is all a good conversation. There's an engineer who I think still works at Google,
[01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:31.040]   the name of Warren Craddock, who posted a very interesting thread on Twitter a couple months ago,
[01:28:31.040 --> 01:28:37.600]   starting off with, he worked on the Litro Lightfield camera, he worked on Google Glass,
[01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:42.160]   he also worked on the Google clips, like that little clip-on camera that automatically takes
[01:28:42.160 --> 01:28:48.320]   pictures and puts it onto Google Photos for you. And he's had so many interesting things to say about how
[01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:57.200]   development teams can continue to go forward because they're convinced the technology is really cool,
[01:28:57.200 --> 01:29:02.240]   they can convince themselves that this is going to find its purpose and ignore like the biggest
[01:29:02.240 --> 01:29:08.080]   problems with it, specifically with Google Glass. He said Google Glass actually had two fatal flaws,
[01:29:08.080 --> 01:29:12.560]   number one, it didn't really do anything very useful and two, you looked stupid while wearing it.
[01:29:12.560 --> 01:29:18.880]   But the culture and the on the team like ignore those flaws, they tried to come up with a reason
[01:29:18.880 --> 01:29:24.240]   for them to exist, they couldn't. So they released the developers, hoping that developers would come
[01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:30.240]   up with a reason for people to want to use Google Glass, even the developers fail to find that reason.
[01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:35.040]   But the internal thinking that, no, no, there has to be something here, there has to be something here.
[01:29:35.040 --> 01:29:40.480]   And possibly that we've just invested too much of our faith in this, too much of our
[01:29:40.480 --> 01:29:45.760]   innovation into this to simply admit that this was a bad idea to begin with. So if this isn't a
[01:29:45.760 --> 01:29:52.080]   really, really, really thorough sort of rumor to investigate, but I would not be at all disappointed
[01:29:52.080 --> 01:30:00.080]   to learn that any company that's working on real effective AR VR is delaying three or four years,
[01:30:00.080 --> 01:30:04.960]   if only to decide that, hey, let's wait for this new display technology to mature,
[01:30:04.960 --> 01:30:13.600]   let's wait until we can manufacture it for less than $1,000. And or let's not try to sell boats
[01:30:13.600 --> 01:30:18.880]   in Nebraska, let's wait for our market to let's let's try to sell boats in Rhode Island, let's try
[01:30:18.880 --> 01:30:24.000]   to sell boats in Florida, let's wait for them to be a market for this thing before we decide to try
[01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:29.040]   to say, Hey, yes, if if you had a large body of water, this would be a wonderful way to travel
[01:30:29.040 --> 01:30:33.760]   across it. It doesn't exist yet. But hey, maybe we'll create one because they're so popular now.
[01:30:33.760 --> 01:30:39.680]   I've been playing the Quest Pro, the $1,600 meta thing actually.
[01:30:41.040 --> 01:30:45.760]   Micah just stole it from me. He's not mean every see it again, because he had the Quest too. And I
[01:30:45.760 --> 01:30:51.280]   wanted and I said, you know, give this a try. It's it's actually really fun, but it's not a world
[01:30:51.280 --> 01:30:56.880]   changing product. And and Meta is trying to make it more of a productivity tool. And there is more
[01:30:56.880 --> 01:31:02.800]   AR capability because now you have color pass through. So you can, you know, have your desktop
[01:31:02.800 --> 01:31:07.200]   floating in your real world. But it's not that compelling of a product. I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:31:07.200 --> 01:31:12.080]   I wonder, I mean, Andy's absolutely right. The I'll throw in there. Also, there's the corporate
[01:31:12.080 --> 01:31:16.000]   chess game, right, which is like, we need to build this product because our compit competitors are
[01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:19.200]   building this product and we need to stop them. And that is not necessarily a reason to have a
[01:31:19.200 --> 01:31:23.520]   product. And like I said, Apple historically has been pretty good with the discipline here.
[01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:27.440]   But yeah, I also wonder when you talk about technologies and component technologies,
[01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:30.560]   you've got a whole team of people working on this product. I wonder if they get to the point
[01:31:30.560 --> 01:31:34.640]   where they say, okay, we have tried out this new emerging technology that it's not going to be
[01:31:34.640 --> 01:31:39.440]   able to be mass produced at the price that we want for another year or two. And it's a game changer.
[01:31:39.440 --> 01:31:44.400]   And and I can also see them making and I don't know what that technology is, but I could see the
[01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:50.400]   people inside making the argument, we don't have to launch this now. And if we do, this other thing
[01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:57.040]   is going to make it irrelevant in a year or two. So let's wait. And again, historically, and today's
[01:31:57.040 --> 01:32:01.840]   Apple is different from historic Apple, but historically Apple has shown great restraint and
[01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:06.640]   said, we're going to move at the right time when the right tech is there for our first generation
[01:32:06.640 --> 01:32:13.600]   product to be. Yeah, a first generation product, but pretty good and a good start and not a step back,
[01:32:13.600 --> 01:32:17.920]   but a step forward. And I wonder if that is happening here. I'll also point out, just to throw it
[01:32:17.920 --> 01:32:22.800]   into the Apple car rumors, we've been talking about for a million years now. I take that as a
[01:32:22.800 --> 01:32:27.360]   sign of a healthy company that they've spent a lot of money on that and not done a product,
[01:32:27.360 --> 01:32:32.320]   because there's no product there, at least not yet. I think that that's a good sign. So I'm not
[01:32:32.320 --> 01:32:36.400]   saying that like, I hope that this product doesn't come out next year. I'm just saying like, if it
[01:32:36.400 --> 01:32:43.040]   doesn't, I suspect it's because they have had the discipline to say, it's just not time. It's not
[01:32:43.040 --> 01:32:47.440]   our time for this product. It might even be fully ready, fully made, but it's just not the right time.
[01:32:47.440 --> 01:32:48.880]   Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah, everybody.
[01:32:48.880 --> 01:32:52.720]   Look at the price. And I say, forget it. Nobody's going to buy this because it's just we can't,
[01:32:52.720 --> 01:32:57.040]   we got to get the price down further or we got to get this feature. And it's cost too much right
[01:32:57.040 --> 01:33:02.160]   now. I mean, it could be some very simple. And I'll throw out there. I wouldn't put it past them at
[01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:06.240]   some point to do if they have a product that's sort of ready to go and they're not going to do it
[01:33:06.240 --> 01:33:12.320]   to it some point, maybe do like a developer kit or something that is actually that hardware,
[01:33:12.320 --> 01:33:17.120]   but to sell it to the general public, they want to, they want it to be a winner, right? And if they
[01:33:17.120 --> 01:33:21.520]   think it's going to not be a winner because it's going to be too expensive, then don't release it.
[01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:26.880]   Just there's no reason to release it. I don't think that it's about money. They could put out a 25
[01:33:26.880 --> 01:33:30.640]   hundred dollar product. They're one of the few companies that could and probably sell a lot
[01:33:30.640 --> 01:33:36.000]   of those products, probably more than anybody sold up until now in this vertical.
[01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:39.360]   Yeah, I paid 16-hour bucks. I don't even like meta.
[01:33:39.360 --> 01:33:42.080]   Right. But what if it's a good enough at 25 hundred?
[01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:44.640]   No, it's a good point. It's the value proposition. It's the value proposition.
[01:33:44.640 --> 01:33:49.920]   Yeah. Exactly. And I think that that that do they have the content that's going to make it
[01:33:49.920 --> 01:33:56.560]   that's going to move the needle? Do they have the, again, the tech, is it going to be 8k per i?
[01:33:57.200 --> 01:34:04.000]   That's really, it has to be over 6k per i and preferably closer to 8k per i or it's just not going
[01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:10.240]   to turn the corner on a 2500 dollars to your point. And so those are the things that it has
[01:34:10.240 --> 01:34:14.960]   to be able to process. It's a big thing. I think that we've seen some rumors where they're talking
[01:34:14.960 --> 01:34:21.600]   about an M1 or M2 or M series for each i to keep that kind of flow throughing. And then you have
[01:34:21.600 --> 01:34:26.400]   battery issues, then you have connectivity issues, but you're really looking at,
[01:34:26.400 --> 01:34:31.840]   you got to be able to support probably 4 million polygons per i and 8k per i. And that's a,
[01:34:31.840 --> 01:34:38.800]   that is a, it's a lot. And I think that that's where this, in the longer you wait and as meta
[01:34:38.800 --> 01:34:43.360]   keeps on making it better, that has to, that bar, they keep moving. But really, I don't think
[01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:47.440]   it's going to go much over that as far as what the requirements look like. Maybe more on the
[01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:51.520]   polygonal side to get more detail, but, and the current phone does that, but it's different to
[01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:57.440]   have a phone than a, than a headset. Yeah. And you, and you still went up with the problem where
[01:34:57.440 --> 01:35:01.120]   if you're trying to make it a consumer product, how do you get over on the fact that you look
[01:35:01.120 --> 01:35:05.600]   stupid while wearing them? And you don't have a really good argument for why anybody needs this.
[01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:10.160]   It's a, I mean, there's a, the, the saving grace has always been that there are lots of
[01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:14.800]   corporations, lots of verticals that would love to have this sort of stuff, like government,
[01:35:14.800 --> 01:35:18.240]   any, any company that's in, that does, spends a lot of money on training and maintenance,
[01:35:18.240 --> 01:35:24.000]   medicine. So you can, you can, you can do very, very well with a $2,000, $3,000 headset that
[01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:27.920]   serves those needs. But when you're trying to, when you're trying to create the next iPhone,
[01:35:27.920 --> 01:35:31.680]   it's going to be really, really super hard. You're going to have to, you're going to beat
[01:35:31.680 --> 01:35:37.360]   saber is awesome. The idea of, of having a, having a virtual screen in front of you and a virtual
[01:35:37.360 --> 01:35:42.000]   screen to your left while you're, while you're on an airplane, that's awesome. That's cool. That's,
[01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:47.200]   that's great. It's just great. But you're not going to get people to keep this thing on their faces
[01:35:47.200 --> 01:35:51.040]   and spend any kind of money for it until you tell them that this is something you can,
[01:35:51.040 --> 01:35:55.360]   this is something that will solve problems for you and create opportunities for you. And no,
[01:35:55.360 --> 01:35:58.640]   I don't think anybody's cracked that yet. And I think that one of the things that,
[01:35:58.640 --> 01:36:03.200]   that one of the big questions is how long are you going to put those on, on your head to your
[01:36:03.200 --> 01:36:06.720]   point? And I think that there's a lot of discussion that happens around that because
[01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:11.440]   right now the setup, every time I set something, every time I put the headset on,
[01:36:12.080 --> 01:36:15.920]   the setup of, of, am I back in the environment that I'm in? This is something that Apple could
[01:36:15.920 --> 01:36:22.320]   potentially crack because they own all the devices where I'm on Apple TV. I'm watching MLS.
[01:36:22.320 --> 01:36:27.440]   I want to see some extra thing during the ad. Let's say the ad that Apple sells me.
[01:36:27.440 --> 01:36:31.840]   I put that thing on. It has to, it knows that I'm watching that. It knows who I am. And it
[01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:35.760]   immediately goes, I'm going to give you something. I don't have to sit there and hit buttons and do
[01:36:35.760 --> 01:36:39.920]   things and everything else. I watch something for a minute or two minutes or five minutes or whatever.
[01:36:39.920 --> 01:36:45.120]   And then I take it off. But the only reason that that works, the put on take off process is if you
[01:36:45.120 --> 01:36:50.240]   get rid of the setup. And right now, for most of these headsets, putting something on now,
[01:36:50.240 --> 01:36:55.840]   like especially if you're new at it, is a whole bunch of debris that you have to work through
[01:36:55.840 --> 01:36:59.920]   before you get to what you're trying to do. And that's the, and I think Apple, again,
[01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:03.760]   because it has the whole ecosystem, can solve that, but they have to, or they have to say,
[01:37:03.760 --> 01:37:09.120]   I'm going to give you long form, which I think that even they probably are taking time.
[01:37:09.120 --> 01:37:15.760]   I really have reservations on the eye health related to someone who's developed 360 for the last
[01:37:15.760 --> 01:37:20.240]   almost 10 years now, the eye health of keeping the headset on for a long time. I'm not certain
[01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:25.840]   that's a good idea. It's, you know, for two hours or three hours watching a movie on it. I have some,
[01:37:25.840 --> 01:37:31.760]   I definitely have some concerns and forcing your eyes to do that. I'm not sure that 50 years from
[01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:35.440]   now or 20 years from now will think that was a good idea. We made lots of those mistakes in the
[01:37:35.440 --> 01:37:41.120]   last 100 years. So we talked last week about Evans Hanky saying she's going to leave as Apple's
[01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:47.280]   head of design. A number of articles coming out now in a variety of places saying this,
[01:37:47.280 --> 01:37:55.120]   this design role is hard to fill and the, and the turn style revolving doors haven't, haven't helped.
[01:37:55.120 --> 01:38:01.360]   But since Johnny, I've left, in fact, even since Steve Jobs died, it's been a problem.
[01:38:02.960 --> 01:38:08.560]   Is this a problem? We should be concerned about Bloomberg is saying the company is struggling
[01:38:08.560 --> 01:38:16.480]   to find the new design leader. Yeah, I don't know this brain. I think brain drain in general is a
[01:38:16.480 --> 01:38:20.320]   problem at Apple, right? You've got a lot of people who've been there a long time, who've gotten paid
[01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:25.680]   a lot in Apple shares, those shares are with a lot of money. They don't need to maybe work on
[01:38:25.680 --> 01:38:30.000]   and work the hours and under the pressure. And like, I think that there is a brain drain
[01:38:30.880 --> 01:38:36.160]   that is a broad issue, not just with a design group. It does also sound in this case like that
[01:38:36.160 --> 01:38:40.320]   story by Grumman, like he keeps listing names after names after names. People have left. We
[01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:44.640]   didn't even know that. It was Johnny, Johnny built a team and they were a tight team for a lot of years.
[01:38:44.640 --> 01:38:50.560]   Ork and Dorfer, Julian Honig, McLussell Vonto, Daniel de Ullius, all left in 2019.
[01:38:50.560 --> 01:38:55.520]   And they had four people go to love from right from there to stay with Johnny. Like it's Johnny's
[01:38:55.520 --> 01:39:00.560]   team. It was a tight team. Apple benefited it from it greatly. And they broke up, right? Because
[01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:06.880]   Johnny left and the band broke up eventually. And Evans Hanky was still there. But like,
[01:39:06.880 --> 01:39:11.920]   this is the challenge is what do we learn about Apple, right? One, we've learned that people from
[01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:15.760]   the outside don't really flourish at Apple, generally, because Apple is its own thing. And
[01:39:15.760 --> 01:39:18.960]   then you've got a lot of people there who've got a lot of institutional knowledge, but they've
[01:39:18.960 --> 01:39:23.120]   also got a lot of stock options. And they've made a lot of money. And they've been grinding it for
[01:39:23.120 --> 01:39:28.320]   a decade or more. So they may not be inclined to stay. And you end up in this situation where
[01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:35.040]   how do you build a new team is you've got to find somebody who gets Apple, who is a leader,
[01:39:35.040 --> 01:39:39.040]   and is going to be able to assemble the next team. And you know, there's some speculation in
[01:39:39.040 --> 01:39:43.360]   there about it. But it is certainly a quandary. And I think it's one of those things that's
[01:39:43.360 --> 01:39:48.000]   usually invisible to us on the outside. But I think is a constant problem now for Apple is
[01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:54.160]   how do you build up the farm team so that they're ready to take over when you've had these,
[01:39:54.160 --> 01:39:58.640]   these, these groups that have been together for years and have made all this stuff happen.
[01:39:58.640 --> 01:40:04.400]   How do you manage to make that kind of seamless transition to the next generation? And it seems
[01:40:04.400 --> 01:40:11.040]   like with Johnny leaving, they're kind of at loose ends really to find out who they are going to have
[01:40:11.040 --> 01:40:16.800]   lead it. Yeah, and that's kind of surprising because in key positions, one of the things that I think
[01:40:16.800 --> 01:40:21.520]   we all appreciate about Apple is that they do appreciate culture and continuity that they're
[01:40:21.520 --> 01:40:25.440]   not going to simply, they rarely simply say, you know what, we need to shake things up. We're going
[01:40:25.440 --> 01:40:29.520]   to bring in this person who used to work for, used to work for Dell and they're going to be
[01:40:29.520 --> 01:40:34.080]   their head of the head of a keyboard researcher or whatever. It's no that someone who has been
[01:40:34.080 --> 01:40:37.920]   the company for 10 years understands exactly how Apple works, how it likes to do things, what
[01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:42.960]   its priorities are, what its resources are and can fit and excel within that environment.
[01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:47.520]   And so the idea of not having someone who's not having an answer to the question, what happens
[01:40:47.520 --> 01:40:53.520]   when Johnny I get to eat, eat, feed and decides to and decides to leave, that's a little bit
[01:40:53.520 --> 01:40:57.840]   surprising to me that they didn't have that ready to go. Although the article was, did,
[01:40:57.840 --> 01:41:05.360]   did maybe show off a possible benefit to all this that in the vacuum of leadership there,
[01:41:05.360 --> 01:41:10.240]   without a very, very strong personality who's heading the design team, operations was able to,
[01:41:10.240 --> 01:41:17.280]   has been able to assert a firmer hand saying that, well, no, we are, we are not going to have like
[01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:23.360]   round keycaps. We're going to have something that is actually very, very practical and expensive and
[01:41:23.360 --> 01:41:28.000]   uncomplicated and doesn't really screw up the user experience for lots of people. I don't care if
[01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:35.120]   the design makes you want to make the design of a traditionally placed USB port makes you want to
[01:41:35.120 --> 01:41:38.640]   throw up in your mouth, unquote, we are going to have it because that's what people want and that's
[01:41:38.640 --> 01:41:43.200]   what will make this a very, very sane and practical design. So I would like to see a little bit more
[01:41:43.200 --> 01:41:48.400]   of that. I would also like to see colors in the, in the MacBook Airline. I like to see a little
[01:41:48.400 --> 01:41:55.040]   bit of Apple craziness, but I'm kind of glad that in the recent years we have seen a resort, a return
[01:41:55.040 --> 01:41:59.280]   to wow, that is actually a very good looking, but also practical and functional design that I can
[01:41:59.280 --> 01:42:03.280]   work with as to rely on as a $2,000 computer that's going to make me money.
[01:42:03.280 --> 01:42:09.040]   Hanky hasn't been in charge long enough to, German points out to oversee the end to end development
[01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:16.160]   of any released product. It shows you how long it takes to make an out product. Yeah, that's right.
[01:42:16.160 --> 01:42:23.840]   Yeah. But they also, he says, there, there's more focus on cost than before. Do you think that's
[01:42:23.840 --> 01:42:30.880]   chasing some designers out that they don't want to be constrained by cost? I mean, my first off,
[01:42:30.880 --> 01:42:36.320]   I think that they were constrained by cost always. Maybe right. I think that there's some unrealistic
[01:42:36.320 --> 01:42:39.680]   thought there. It may be that the, I mean, that was obviously the narrative in that trip
[01:42:39.680 --> 01:42:44.640]   MacBook book was that the people in charge of operations had more upper hand than the designers,
[01:42:44.640 --> 01:42:50.000]   but I think always designers have constraints that they have to work in and that that's just
[01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:55.200]   kind of part of it. My guess is that this is, this seems very much like a natural exodus of a
[01:42:55.200 --> 01:42:59.360]   long team that's breaking up over time, but you do want a strong leader, right? I mean,
[01:42:59.360 --> 01:43:05.280]   a strong design leader, like the operations people are not going to be designing products.
[01:43:05.280 --> 01:43:10.960]   You need a strong design lead to say, here's what matters and here's what doesn't matter,
[01:43:10.960 --> 01:43:18.240]   even under those constraints. Yeah. Well, we'll watch with interest, Apple's design is super
[01:43:18.240 --> 01:43:23.760]   important to Apple's. Yeah. And I think that, yeah, to Jason's point, I mean, I think a strong
[01:43:23.760 --> 01:43:29.600]   leader keeps a lot of people and when there's just the rest of them working together. And then
[01:43:29.600 --> 01:43:33.840]   if there's, it's not so much that there aren't resource constraints, but there could be more,
[01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:38.640]   a more practical view of some of those things. And when they, when they get constrained and they
[01:43:38.640 --> 01:43:42.560]   don't have that one person keeping them excited and keeping them focused, I could definitely see
[01:43:42.560 --> 01:43:45.440]   them looking for greener pastures because they don't, they don't need to work anymore. I mean,
[01:43:45.440 --> 01:43:49.040]   if you've been there for Apple for 20 years on Gold Handcuffs, the Gold Handcuffs turn into
[01:43:49.040 --> 01:43:53.200]   golden wings at some point and then you just decide, do I really want to do this? Yeah.
[01:43:53.200 --> 01:44:03.760]   There's a few other small stories. I guess we could talk about the level lock that was
[01:44:03.760 --> 01:44:11.520]   picked in 30 seconds is a $300 Apple home kit lock. Every lock can be picked in 30 seconds.
[01:44:11.520 --> 01:44:16.560]   Yeah. No, not, well, not exactly true. I have the same problem with another smart look that I
[01:44:16.560 --> 01:44:22.480]   tried out. My pick of the week a while ago was a, a simple like $20 lock picking sec from the lock,
[01:44:22.480 --> 01:44:26.240]   the lock picking lawyer, the same people who did this video about this other smart lock. And when
[01:44:26.240 --> 01:44:31.760]   you find, when you discover that all this is, is like a tiny little bent piece of metal acting as a
[01:44:31.760 --> 01:44:36.640]   leaver and a tiny little punched out piece of metal that just has like a little wave at the end of it.
[01:44:36.640 --> 01:44:42.320]   And you are opening it in three seconds. I mean, just three, it's not like, not like you've got the
[01:44:42.320 --> 01:44:47.840]   stethoscope against the door and your, your sandpaper. I'm saying that like after seeing like a
[01:44:47.840 --> 01:44:53.200]   simple video on how to use this, you're opening this lock in three seconds. And then you go to
[01:44:53.200 --> 01:44:57.200]   a locksmith and say with this, I went to a locksmith with this lock because I wanted to put on my door
[01:44:57.200 --> 01:45:03.920]   and say, can you upgrade this lock for me? And the idea of wave picks have been around for decades.
[01:45:03.920 --> 01:45:09.920]   Lock manufacturers know how to build lock sets that defeat them. And so for all of like $30,
[01:45:09.920 --> 01:45:14.800]   I upgraded this thing. They took out the old core put in a new core so that I can't pick it as a
[01:45:14.800 --> 01:45:19.520]   novice in five minutes, excuse me, in five seconds. So yeah, this is kind of a big deal. I appreciate
[01:45:19.520 --> 01:45:24.000]   what they're saying where people most of it's, it's not people who are picking locks who are getting
[01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:28.080]   into doors. They're people who are climbing into windows and taking advantage of unlocked doors.
[01:45:28.080 --> 01:45:33.120]   But still, I, I'm, I've always said that was my, that was their response. The company's response
[01:45:33.120 --> 01:45:39.360]   to the, the videos. My biggest, my biggest fear is not like the professional cat burglar. My
[01:45:39.360 --> 01:45:44.960]   biggest fear are like the, the knuckleheads, the chowderheads, who like at some point in the last
[01:45:44.960 --> 01:45:49.200]   five years saw a YouTube video about this, they bought a wave pick and they decided, Hey, I wonder,
[01:45:49.200 --> 01:45:53.920]   Hey, I wonder if I can open up this door. Hey, look, I can. Oh yeah, I think that I think that my
[01:45:53.920 --> 01:45:58.400]   neighbor Andy's gonna is out for the day because I don't see his bike parked outside. I think I'll
[01:45:58.400 --> 01:46:01.520]   just walk through and see what's around here. It's like, that's the, that's the kind of knucklehead
[01:46:01.520 --> 01:46:06.080]   that I'm most afraid of. That's the, was the point of the video was this is a kind of rudimentary
[01:46:06.080 --> 01:46:12.400]   technique and expensive locks should not be vulnerable to $350. Yeah. It should be,
[01:46:12.400 --> 01:46:16.720]   you need a higher quality of burglar in order to break into lock picking lawyer. I love the,
[01:46:16.720 --> 01:46:22.960]   I do feel like the best, the best locks, best smart locks to get are either ones that let you use your
[01:46:22.960 --> 01:46:29.360]   own key way or whatever they call it, or the ones that don't have a key. Yeah. At all. Yeah.
[01:46:29.360 --> 01:46:33.760]   Because then you have to use, I mean, and then people, yeah, they'll break their window or
[01:46:33.760 --> 01:46:38.880]   whatever, but the, it, because yeah, there are, if the lock picking lawyer as taught us anything is
[01:46:38.880 --> 01:46:44.800]   that it, you know, you can get into any lock. And so maybe this one is, is easy, but like, again,
[01:46:45.520 --> 01:46:50.320]   the lock is there to just a people from bar. It's like putting, you know, back in the day,
[01:46:50.320 --> 01:46:55.840]   putting a club on your car. It is, it is to dissuade people from choosing to break into your house.
[01:46:55.840 --> 01:47:01.920]   Go to the next town. Yeah. Go to the open window door. Level says only 4% of houses are, are
[01:47:01.920 --> 01:47:08.320]   entered by a lock pick. 38% are entered by unforced entry through an open window or door.
[01:47:08.320 --> 01:47:14.240]   And, uh, lock picking lawyer says, oh, and watch me use a bump key to do this as well.
[01:47:14.800 --> 01:47:22.000]   So yeah. Yeah. I mean, I'll, I'll, I'll say go ahead. But clearly they spent their money on, on,
[01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:26.960]   on their tech and they've not spent it. I, I agree with Andy. The, the mismatch here is it's a $330
[01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:31.360]   lock that they obviously spend very little on the locking mechanism. And it's a lock. It's a lock.
[01:47:31.360 --> 01:47:36.880]   It's a good, good luck. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It just doesn't take that much skill. Like it's,
[01:47:36.880 --> 01:47:42.080]   it's to get most, most locks and, and even with skill, it's so much easier to go through a window
[01:47:42.080 --> 01:47:45.520]   or, or, or something else than, than to go through a lock. I mean, it's, you know,
[01:47:45.520 --> 01:47:49.440]   how do you know this? Yeah. Yeah. I'm like myself out of the house a lot. Oh, okay. Good.
[01:47:49.440 --> 01:47:54.000]   So when I was a kid, when I was a kid, I, I could, I could open a combination lock faster
[01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:57.760]   without the, without the combination than with the combination of the, with the combination.
[01:47:57.760 --> 01:48:01.120]   I had to remember what it was without the combination. I just listened to the gates,
[01:48:01.120 --> 01:48:04.000]   you know, you just go, I go this way, this way, this way, this way, this way, they don't die.
[01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:09.040]   And, um, and so, uh, so it, it's not, you know, but I spent a lot of time, you know, watching TV and
[01:48:09.040 --> 01:48:12.720]   having picking locks. It was a good, fast time. Yeah. So the, um,
[01:48:12.720 --> 01:48:17.520]   their hacker, past time, it's like the first, oh yeah, the first level of hacking. I got my
[01:48:17.520 --> 01:48:21.280]   son. I got my son. I got my son. The first, they now make the first locks. Go ahead. So you can
[01:48:21.280 --> 01:48:25.680]   see it while you're doing it. Oh, it's great. Yeah. It's great. Yeah. Yeah. Magic, magic and
[01:48:25.680 --> 01:48:30.880]   lock picking are two of the common, like cultural, when you learn that, like, all dry, every lock,
[01:48:30.880 --> 01:48:36.320]   every lock is a lie and that people can be fooled with magic with very, very simple tricks. It
[01:48:36.320 --> 01:48:41.520]   changes your outlook on the entire world. But, but yeah, but this, this is, but the, I mean, the
[01:48:41.520 --> 01:48:45.680]   last thing I'll point out is that do you remember, like the time where you'd be walking down the
[01:48:45.680 --> 01:48:50.720]   street and you see, wow, that's, I keep seeing a lot of big white plastic, big pens that the end
[01:48:50.720 --> 01:48:54.880]   is kind of like all scratched up and flared out. I wonder why that is. And that's because like,
[01:48:54.880 --> 01:49:00.960]   it became, it became, it spread like wildfire, the knowledge that a big pen was exactly, if you
[01:49:00.960 --> 01:49:06.080]   just jam it into a bike block with a circular keyway and just keep rubbing it, it will pop open
[01:49:06.080 --> 01:49:10.080]   and now, now the bike locks don't work that way. But that's the sort of thing you're afraid of.
[01:49:10.080 --> 01:49:14.480]   Again, not the professionals, but the people who are like, are, who will steal a bike if they find
[01:49:14.480 --> 01:49:17.920]   out, hey, wow, there's this really easy, I'm not, I'm not going to invest the time, money and
[01:49:17.920 --> 01:49:22.160]   expertise to learn how to pick a circular keyway. But if I find out from somebody that, hey, there's
[01:49:22.160 --> 01:49:26.240]   a cool trick that you can just take this big pen in your pocket and open up any bike lock,
[01:49:26.240 --> 01:49:29.680]   that turns them into a knucklehead who will probably take your bike and then just simply throw it
[01:49:29.680 --> 01:49:32.800]   into a ravine after they don't have that because they weren't interested in stealing it anyway.
[01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:37.440]   The lock is a lie, says Andy. Every lock is a lie.
[01:49:37.440 --> 01:49:47.360]   Ufi has launched a fine-mind compatible smart tracker, Ufi, which is Anchor's
[01:49:47.360 --> 01:49:51.360]   consumer electronics division. It does some good stuff. Nobody's too late.
[01:49:51.360 --> 01:49:56.480]   Yeah, well, it works with a fine-mind, right? So it's a little cheaper than an air tag.
[01:49:56.480 --> 01:50:00.800]   It's also, it looks like a little bigger and bulkier than an air tag.
[01:50:01.600 --> 01:50:09.600]   Apple has officially certified the security smart track link. So it's a, it's a, it's a made for
[01:50:09.600 --> 01:50:16.240]   iPhone thing. 1999 is a single, single unit, 40 bucks for a two-pack at the bundle for 50 bucks.
[01:50:16.240 --> 01:50:23.440]   It includes a yard sign saying protected by Ufi security, which is pretty funny since this
[01:50:23.440 --> 01:50:31.680]   isn't a lock. So yard size saying burglars, please Google Ufi and how to override for instructions
[01:50:31.680 --> 01:50:37.200]   on how to break into our home. It can play an alarm and as a replaceable CR2032 battery,
[01:50:37.200 --> 01:50:41.600]   it can last up to a year. Hey, I have to replace, I did get a notice from my air tags, it's been a
[01:50:41.600 --> 01:50:45.600]   year to replace the battery. Is that pretty easy to do? Did you just unscrew it?
[01:50:45.600 --> 01:50:51.440]   Yeah, I think so. And don't, and don't buy the one, don't buy the one with the bitter coating,
[01:50:51.440 --> 01:50:54.880]   because it's actually too thick. The one that keeps kids from eating batteries, you need to buy the
[01:50:54.880 --> 01:51:00.640]   ones without the bitter coating. No bitter coating. No tolerance. Yeah. I even know they
[01:51:00.640 --> 01:51:05.200]   wear batteries with a bitter coating. They do. You haven't been tasting your batteries? Well,
[01:51:05.200 --> 01:51:10.240]   your little kids are. And so they make them with bitter coating. But those those don't have the
[01:51:10.240 --> 01:51:15.760]   tolerances. Yeah, send it back. Waiter. I need a new battery, a sweeter battery than this one.
[01:51:15.760 --> 01:51:20.080]   So I just unscrewed your coated truck. Shoulder coated batteries. That's the next,
[01:51:20.080 --> 01:51:26.080]   next big thing. Oh, man. Yeah. All right, let's take a break and come back with your picks of the week.
[01:51:26.080 --> 01:51:31.680]   Boys and girls, our show today brought to you as all our shows are by the wonderful folks
[01:51:31.680 --> 01:51:40.000]   in Club Twit. Thank you, Club Twit members. If you're not a member, let me encourage you. It is
[01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:46.080]   really becoming more and more important. We're facing quite a shortfall in 2023 and Club Twit,
[01:51:46.800 --> 01:51:52.480]   the burden is on you to make up the difference. But I have to say, I think you get value for
[01:51:52.480 --> 01:51:58.880]   dollar at $7 a month. You can get a yearly plan. It's $84. It's not it's not less expensive. You can
[01:51:58.880 --> 01:52:04.960]   also get a corporate plans. Those are discounted for large numbers of people. What do you get?
[01:52:04.960 --> 01:52:09.360]   Add free versions of all of our shows. We don't need to put an ad in there. We don't need to
[01:52:09.360 --> 01:52:14.160]   track you. We don't need to do anything because you're paying us, which is nice. You also get the
[01:52:14.160 --> 01:52:21.760]   bonus content, which will include, I believe today, Andy's rendition of, what was it you were
[01:52:21.760 --> 01:52:30.640]   singing? It was a medley of Tom Jones hits Tom Jones singing, Prince San Kiss. It's quite good,
[01:52:30.640 --> 01:52:35.440]   quite good. And I think we had a hand dancing from the other panelists.
[01:52:35.440 --> 01:52:39.600]   There's a lot going on. It was a lot going on. That should be part of the show.
[01:52:39.600 --> 01:52:40.800]   We had some technical difficulties.
[01:52:40.800 --> 01:52:44.480]   That'll be technical difficulties are the best kind. Turn into magic.
[01:52:44.480 --> 01:52:49.440]   As soon as we found out that the news that the news zoom hardware, the news zoom software
[01:52:49.440 --> 01:52:53.280]   we're going to be using next week allows us to synchronize much, much better. Yeah, there was
[01:52:53.280 --> 01:52:58.800]   there's a slow EDM going on. That was great. So that will be part of the trip plus feed. Plus,
[01:52:58.800 --> 01:53:03.280]   we also put shows that we don't put out in public. There are club only shows like Hands on Mac,
[01:53:03.280 --> 01:53:10.080]   Mike a Sargent's great show. Hands on Windows with Paul Therat, the untitled Linux show. We also
[01:53:10.080 --> 01:53:14.640]   have the Gizfizz, Stacey's book club. There's a lot of stuff that we do in the club. And I have
[01:53:14.640 --> 01:53:21.200]   to say it all centers around our wonderful discord, which is the best social network ever. If you want
[01:53:21.200 --> 01:53:27.520]   to hang out with a few thousand people who are Twitch listeners and viewers who are interesting,
[01:53:27.520 --> 01:53:34.800]   savvy, cool and marvelous dancers, this is the place to be. It's not just discussions about the
[01:53:34.800 --> 01:53:39.120]   shows, by the way, we have all the geek topics in there and you can add more if you want. It really
[01:53:39.120 --> 01:53:43.440]   is a lot of fun. So seven bucks a month, you get the discord, you get the ad free versions of all
[01:53:43.440 --> 01:53:47.680]   the shows, you get shows we don't put out anywhere else, you get content from pre and post shows we
[01:53:47.680 --> 01:53:51.600]   don't put out anywhere else. I think that's a good deal. We're trying to make it really valuable to
[01:53:51.600 --> 01:53:58.960]   you because it is so valuable to us. If you want if we want to think of what Twitch's going to look
[01:53:58.960 --> 01:54:05.680]   like in the years ahead, the club is a very important part of this. So thank you club members.
[01:54:05.680 --> 01:54:13.760]   And if you're not a member, twit.tv/clubtwit and I thank you in advance. Somebody wants an
[01:54:13.760 --> 01:54:21.120]   all ad channeling club twit. Beat you to it. It's not a it's not a podcast, but there is a section
[01:54:21.120 --> 01:54:27.600]   in the club twit discord called all the ads. Somebody said, well, I want the ads. So we just put
[01:54:27.600 --> 01:54:35.280]   all the ads into the all the ad section. So there's, you know, if you want the ads, you get the ads.
[01:54:35.280 --> 01:54:43.040]   If you want them, but only if you want them. Twit.tv/clubtwit. Now pick of the week time. I'm going to
[01:54:43.040 --> 01:54:51.840]   start because there's been a big move away from Twitter of late into something we've been doing
[01:54:51.840 --> 01:54:57.360]   for a long time. In fact, if you look at my lower third for the last few years, it's not said at
[01:54:57.360 --> 01:55:02.560]   Leo report on Twitter. It said, twit.social/atleo. That is our
[01:55:02.560 --> 01:55:08.960]   Mastodon instance open to all, but it's pretty much designed for people who listen
[01:55:08.960 --> 01:55:14.800]   to our shows. I have it in the advanced mode. So it looks a lot like a tweet deck. And it's become
[01:55:14.800 --> 01:55:22.640]   a Elon free microblogging network that's really, really great. You're all welcome to join it.
[01:55:22.640 --> 01:55:26.800]   But I see a lot of people join us during just a joint of from Wall Street Journal saying,
[01:55:26.800 --> 01:55:31.760]   well, what's the iOS app? Because the web is great. On your desktop, there's a web app. There actually,
[01:55:31.760 --> 01:55:38.240]   there are also apps for Mac OS for the desktop. But if you want to use it on iOS, there are maybe
[01:55:38.240 --> 01:55:44.000]   a half dozen different Mastodon apps because it's an open source project. It's open. There's a strong
[01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:48.720]   API uses activity pub. So a lot of people have written apps, but this is the best one. It's open
[01:55:48.720 --> 01:55:55.200]   source and free from Metabolist. It's called meta text. So more, this is more informational. It
[01:55:55.200 --> 01:56:00.880]   also supports the iPhone, the iPad as well as the iPhone. So it's really a nice way
[01:56:00.880 --> 01:56:07.520]   to use Mastodon. So if you're in our Twitter social Mastodon or any other Mastodon,
[01:56:07.520 --> 01:56:12.960]   and you want to participate in that in lieu of Twitter or even, I guess you could do both.
[01:56:12.960 --> 01:56:20.800]   But why? Meta text from Metabolist. Really, really good. Alex Lindsey, your pick of the week.
[01:56:21.920 --> 01:56:28.240]   Yeah. So I was, I'm on a lot of lists. And one app that started to bubble up among CG artists
[01:56:28.240 --> 01:56:34.400]   and that I opened up and really enjoy is called Nomad. Nomad is a 3D sculpting program. If you've
[01:56:34.400 --> 01:56:41.120]   ever heard of something like Form Z, not Form Z, but Zbrush, I got the Z's mixed up, but Zbrush,
[01:56:41.120 --> 01:56:45.360]   it is very much like Zbrush. It works on your phone. And so basically, what you can do is simply
[01:56:45.360 --> 01:56:51.040]   paint in 3D. So you're basically, you can just sculpt with your finger and start building models.
[01:56:51.040 --> 01:56:55.680]   And there's a lot of professional tools, again, similar to simplified version
[01:56:55.680 --> 01:57:00.240]   from what you would see in something like Zbrush. But it's a great little app that runs on your
[01:57:00.240 --> 01:57:05.360]   phone. There's a couple other ones. There's Forger that also works on the iPad. But you can see
[01:57:05.360 --> 01:57:09.840]   some of the tools, some of the stuff here, and the people are sculpting. This is sculpting with
[01:57:09.840 --> 01:57:16.320]   their finger on a phone. That's so cool. And so anyway, so there's, it's a really,
[01:57:16.960 --> 01:57:21.600]   I'm going to apologize ahead of time that even if you're not, if you don't see yourself as a
[01:57:21.600 --> 01:57:26.560]   sculptor, these apps can suck up an enormous amount of your time. Oh, it has a life.
[01:57:26.560 --> 01:57:31.680]   It's so much fun. Yeah. And so there's so much fun to use. And you're simply just kind of,
[01:57:31.680 --> 01:57:35.840]   and unlike clay, you can go do something else very quickly without having to wash your hands.
[01:57:35.840 --> 01:57:42.000]   And you can undo and you can do all those other things. And I've been playing with some version of
[01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:49.120]   these for the last 20 years. And it's just really the fact that you can do something at the level
[01:57:49.120 --> 01:57:56.480]   that this app is working at is pretty amazing. So it's called Nomad and it's available on iOS.
[01:57:56.480 --> 01:58:01.520]   There might be a desktop version, but it's what I'm playing with is on the phone,
[01:58:01.520 --> 01:58:06.720]   which is kind of amazing. Also, as a side note, I just wanted to say that Zoom had,
[01:58:06.720 --> 01:58:10.480]   Zoomtopia had their keynote today. And they mentioned something that I thought Leo,
[01:58:10.480 --> 01:58:16.480]   you'd like to know in addition to Zoom, I so yes, it's not shipping yet, but they announced that
[01:58:16.480 --> 01:58:22.320]   they're going to have double end recording. Oh, good. So we don't do that, you don't do that here,
[01:58:22.320 --> 01:58:26.400]   but but for ladies who do podcasts. Oh, yeah. It's like, you know,
[01:58:26.400 --> 01:58:30.400]   a lot of people under Jason, right? Everything is deep. Yeah. So that's where you're going to
[01:58:30.400 --> 01:58:36.000]   both ends. And then you send your file up to the host or the editor, and then he puts it together.
[01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:39.760]   And it sounds like you're all in the same room. We get such good results to zoom. I don't even
[01:58:39.760 --> 01:58:44.720]   feel like we need to do that to be honest. Yeah, because a lot of folks that get on generally
[01:58:44.720 --> 01:58:49.680]   have good connectivity, but what if you have not a connectivity? So we double in some things where
[01:58:49.680 --> 01:58:53.920]   when we watch it live, it's breaking up and it's doing all kinds of other things. And then
[01:58:53.920 --> 01:58:58.000]   when we get the file back, we're like, Oh, it's quite nice. Yeah, that's the way to do it. Yeah.
[01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:02.720]   Yeah. So so that's just another little side tip. I'm not a real tip tip. Yeah, absolutely.
[01:59:02.720 --> 01:59:06.800]   By the way, it's nomad sculpt. If you're looking for it, there are other nomads in the abstract.
[01:59:06.800 --> 01:59:12.720]   It's funny. There's a lot of nomads. And I thought nomads sculpt. That's just what I searched.
[01:59:12.720 --> 01:59:16.480]   I was like looking for it when someone said, Oh, no, man, no, man, no, man. And I just thought,
[01:59:16.480 --> 01:59:20.000]   well, it'll be some kind of sculpture. You're smart, but just in case.
[01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:27.520]   $15. And it's a, you know, but not a subscription. No, in that purchases just a 15 bucks.
[01:59:27.520 --> 01:59:32.080]   That's I don't know. I haven't seen any in that purchase. And it doesn't say any apps.
[01:59:32.080 --> 01:59:36.080]   It doesn't. Yeah. So and it's, and it is got any notice.
[01:59:36.080 --> 01:59:45.040]   Because what we get. Yeah, exactly. And I don't, I mean, it's so full featured. I can't, I'm again,
[01:59:45.040 --> 01:59:49.760]   kind of amazed of how much got packed into a phone and then how smooth it works. Yeah.
[01:59:49.760 --> 01:59:53.200]   It's really cool. Yeah. Really neat. Andy, pick of the week.
[01:59:53.200 --> 01:59:58.640]   Mine is a keyboard that just came out a couple of months ago from DOS keyboard.
[01:59:58.640 --> 02:00:04.480]   Don't do this to me. I bought the DOS last time. Oh, no. So this is, so this is the Mac Tiger,
[02:00:04.480 --> 02:00:11.280]   who are pretty board? Yes. Which is to me, it's a, it's a nice kind of hybrid between the sort of
[02:00:11.280 --> 02:00:16.720]   like ultra clicky, clicky, clicky, clicky, clicky, like full throw keyboard that people like be
[02:00:16.720 --> 02:00:21.920]   tend to favor and like the flat kind of keyboard that you get from the Apple's Magic Keyboard or
[02:00:21.920 --> 02:00:27.360]   the keyboard that's on your notebook. So they are like full throw, there are full throw mechanical
[02:00:27.360 --> 02:00:32.640]   keys. However, they are half height keys, but it is that they feel great. They are cherry MX
[02:00:32.640 --> 02:00:37.280]   switches, which meet very, very high quality switch. It's two and a half pounds because it's
[02:00:37.280 --> 02:00:42.320]   mounted on a base plate of pre-frameulated amylite, or I don't know what metal it is, but basically,
[02:00:42.320 --> 02:00:50.480]   basically, that was great. Yeah. Yeah. It's aluminum unibody stainless steel top. Exactly.
[02:00:50.480 --> 02:00:56.160]   But the, for me, that's, that's kind of like a, a, an absolute like, nested necessity because I
[02:00:56.160 --> 02:01:02.160]   hate cheap plastic keyboards that like skid across the, because I get across the USB on the back.
[02:01:02.160 --> 02:01:07.440]   It also, right. It's hard, it's hardwired USB cable, but it also has, it also has two high speed
[02:01:07.440 --> 02:01:12.560]   USB-C pass throughs for charging and for just like cooking up like cameras and phones and things
[02:01:12.560 --> 02:01:18.320]   like that. And it duplicates exactly the layout of the Apple Magic Keyboard. So all the keys are
[02:01:18.320 --> 02:01:24.000]   exactly where you'd expect them to be if you're moving, if you're switching between a, between a
[02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:28.960]   mobile keyboard and this one or a magic keyboard. I also like, you know, I call me almost soft,
[02:01:28.960 --> 02:01:34.480]   but I liked having like an actual knob for volume. And so it's actual, actual volume knob and
[02:01:34.480 --> 02:01:38.240]   you turn the knob and you see that. Yeah. Yeah. Because I'm not like, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah,
[02:01:38.240 --> 02:01:39.760]   dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah,
[02:01:39.760 --> 02:01:43.680]   the old dust keyboard that I bought, and your recommendation had that. And I really loved that.
[02:01:43.680 --> 02:01:47.520]   Yeah. Yeah. I mean, there, there are a lot of creature comforts to it. And also the, the, the
[02:01:47.520 --> 02:01:51.600]   keyboard that I do most by typing on is a code keyboard that I bought like five or six, seven
[02:01:51.600 --> 02:01:56.480]   years ago, which is still going great. The, the, the, the loomed back, the back,
[02:01:56.480 --> 02:02:01.920]   aluminum, illumination on the letter D is flickering a little bit. So I could, I call it, I say that
[02:02:01.920 --> 02:02:06.960]   my D is not very tenacious, but it's still very, very worthy of keyboard. But I get it. I get it.
[02:02:06.960 --> 02:02:12.720]   I got it. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. But the only, but that, that does bring up the
[02:02:12.720 --> 02:02:17.120]   only complaint that I kind of have, excuse me, my code keyboard doesn't have like Mac specific key
[02:02:17.120 --> 02:02:20.640]   caps on it. If you're, if you're building your own keyboard, of course, you can order custom key
[02:02:20.640 --> 02:02:24.720]   caps and have all the Mac stuff on it. I have to remember that like the Windows key is the command
[02:02:24.720 --> 02:02:29.760]   key. And I, I, I twinge a little bit as a, as a, as a curious. The only thing I don't like about
[02:02:29.760 --> 02:02:34.080]   it is that this isn't a cheap keyboard. It is, it's, I think it's, I think it's priced correctly for
[02:02:34.080 --> 02:02:41.200]   how it's built. But for $220, I wish, I really wish we're backlit. That's something that feels
[02:02:41.200 --> 02:02:46.720]   like it should be table stakes for a keyboard, the cost more than 200 bucks. Because I don't, and
[02:02:46.720 --> 02:02:51.200]   honestly, you don't, if you don't have a backlit keyboard, you don't recognize how important it is
[02:02:51.200 --> 02:02:55.760]   until the first time you have to switch to a non backlit one. And you're realizing that,
[02:02:55.760 --> 02:02:59.520]   oh, I have to put another light on my desk just to make sure that I can find the home keys really,
[02:02:59.520 --> 02:03:04.240]   really nicely without having to flash flood light with everything. But, but I think that this is a
[02:03:04.240 --> 02:03:09.600]   really, really good substitute for people who are not into spending three, four, five hundred dollars
[02:03:09.600 --> 02:03:14.640]   on like the ultimate. Oh, no, if it's not like the blah, blah, blah, with solid gold, springback
[02:03:14.640 --> 02:03:19.760]   keys, blah, blah, blah, and custom colors and that sort of stuff is a very, very nice upgrade for
[02:03:19.760 --> 02:03:24.720]   people who do lots and lots and lots of writing, lots and lots of work on the keyboard and have
[02:03:24.720 --> 02:03:29.760]   sort of had this idea in their head that maybe this keyboard they've got on their notebook or
[02:03:29.760 --> 02:03:35.200]   the keyboard they've got on the low profile, Logitech or magic keyboard, just and cutting for them.
[02:03:35.200 --> 02:03:39.760]   It will take like any keyboard is going to take you a day or two to get used to just simply the
[02:03:39.760 --> 02:03:45.280]   fact that it's a different keyboard than what you're using. But after that, it's not at all
[02:03:45.280 --> 02:03:49.200]   difficult to use. It's just any keyboard. And like I said, nice, nice transition for a lot of
[02:03:49.200 --> 02:03:54.240]   people. I wonder why Apple doesn't make a mechanical keyboard. It'd be interesting to see what they
[02:03:54.240 --> 02:03:58.960]   would do. I think they do well because, you know, I don't know, maybe because it's just so well
[02:03:58.960 --> 02:04:02.320]   covered like elsewhere. Yeah. So when you when you're dealing with a keyboard or a mouse, they're
[02:04:02.320 --> 02:04:07.520]   free to make like the really wacky, super ultra design looking one because they know that if people
[02:04:07.520 --> 02:04:13.360]   don't like it, hey, there's, I mean, my mouse, my mouse of choice is like this cheap like $35
[02:04:13.360 --> 02:04:20.400]   like Logitech wireless mouse, because it's sculpted nicely has extra buttons on it. I really like it.
[02:04:20.400 --> 02:04:26.160]   I can't use the magic mouse. It's just absolutely unusable to me. But I'm glad that as a sculptural
[02:04:26.160 --> 02:04:30.560]   object, at least during the journey I've period, they might they made something that they wanted
[02:04:30.560 --> 02:04:34.960]   to make. And it's a very aptly looking mouse. But I've come to like the magic mouse only because I
[02:04:34.960 --> 02:04:40.320]   can swipe on it. It's the charging is ridiculous because you have to charge it in the butt. But
[02:04:40.320 --> 02:04:45.920]   the swiping is nice. I don't know. Yeah, I just I just can't like I said, I love the fact a lot of
[02:04:45.920 --> 02:04:51.040]   a lot of the stuff I'm doing is that my desk, right? They're fantastic. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I mean,
[02:04:51.040 --> 02:04:54.640]   my hand is resting on the mouse and scrolling through things that I'm reading or looking through
[02:04:54.640 --> 02:05:00.320]   it an archive to find the thing I want to do. I can't like hold this thing like it's a like it's a
[02:05:00.320 --> 02:05:06.960]   piece of like it's a piece of like French marzipan pastry. I have to hold it delicately by the edges
[02:05:06.960 --> 02:05:11.680]   and hope nobody I didn't need to touch it there. I did touch it there. And now I click someplace I
[02:05:11.680 --> 02:05:18.320]   just I'm glad people who like it like it. I'm I don't like it. So I'll I'll take my $35 vulgar
[02:05:18.320 --> 02:05:23.840]   plastic mouse. I need the other reason I like it. I'm a lefty. And so a lot of logic tick mice are
[02:05:23.840 --> 02:05:31.440]   righty mice and I exactly. Yeah, I like that ambiguous mice mouse. Thank you, Andy. Jason.
[02:05:31.440 --> 02:05:37.120]   By the way, I just bought the keyboard. Jay took me no time. Took me no time. I love my old
[02:05:37.120 --> 02:05:44.880]   desk boot, but it got dust, dust, dust keyboard, that's a good guy. I have some boots from DOS,
[02:05:44.880 --> 02:05:50.560]   but but the keyboard is what we're talking about. Got snagged by somebody and now I I miss it. So
[02:05:50.560 --> 02:05:58.720]   I'm going to get a new one. Thank you. Mr. Jason Snell. Yes, sir. Okay, so
[02:05:58.720 --> 02:06:04.000]   remember RSS before there was all this Twitter nonsense people just read things on blogs and stuff.
[02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:11.280]   Okay, well, so when Google Reader died, a few different companies kind of emerged as alternatives.
[02:06:11.280 --> 02:06:16.960]   One of them is Feed Bin. It's still out there. It is a web interface for RSS. It also will sink
[02:06:16.960 --> 02:06:22.560]   to RSS clients. There are many popular RSS clients. It's $5 a month, $50 a year, but the reason I
[02:06:22.560 --> 02:06:27.920]   wanted to mention it is not only yes, is RSS still a thing you can get in a lot of places and that
[02:06:27.920 --> 02:06:34.320]   there's value in that. But my favorite feature of Feed Bin is it comes with an email address
[02:06:34.320 --> 02:06:40.240]   and you can send all of your newsletters that because everybody's got a newsletter.
[02:06:40.240 --> 02:06:46.400]   Send all your newsletters to your Feed Bin email address and they show up in the Feed Bin reader
[02:06:46.400 --> 02:06:51.840]   or in your RSS reader of choice. So every morning when I wake up and I get my cup of tea and I get
[02:06:51.840 --> 02:06:56.400]   my little English muffin and I'm sitting there reading stuff, I'm using Net Newswire on iOS on
[02:06:56.400 --> 02:07:01.680]   an iPad and I'm reading newsletters from sub stack and elsewhere, all of which have just been poured
[02:07:01.680 --> 02:07:08.240]   right in aside my RSS feeds in Net Newswire. Thanks to Feed Bin and that is why I pay $50 a
[02:07:08.240 --> 02:07:13.760]   year for Feed Bin is I really love the idea of giving. I was not reading my newsletters in my
[02:07:13.760 --> 02:07:17.600]   email client. My email client is not a place I want to be in general. We already established
[02:07:17.600 --> 02:07:24.320]   before the show, I try not to even read my email that often. I definitely don't want to sit there
[02:07:24.320 --> 02:07:30.240]   and read newsletters in there. So I forward them all. I'm using Gmail. You verify your Feed Bin
[02:07:30.240 --> 02:07:36.160]   address and Gmail and then set up some rules and suddenly all my emails are coming straight into
[02:07:36.160 --> 02:07:42.240]   Feed Bin. I think technically my sub stack username now or user ID is literally my Feed Bin address
[02:07:42.800 --> 02:07:48.080]   because that was the easiest way to do it was just to change my address on sub stack to be
[02:07:48.080 --> 02:07:54.480]   Feed Bin. So if you want to do newsletters but you are frustrated about, and sub stack has their
[02:07:54.480 --> 02:07:58.800]   own app, if you're only doing sub stack you could just use the sub stack app. But if you want to
[02:07:58.800 --> 02:08:04.480]   pick and choose and get them from all over, maybe try the Feed Bin email service because I use it
[02:08:04.480 --> 02:08:08.400]   and love it and it has become a regular part of my life. My life is my day and everything.
[02:08:08.400 --> 02:08:15.360]   So they do have an iPad and iOS reader app Feed Bin does. Yeah, you can use Feed Bin's app. You can
[02:08:15.360 --> 02:08:20.800]   use Reader. You can use Net News Wire. I love Net News Wire and so I just have been using that
[02:08:20.800 --> 02:08:25.440]   and it's gotten me into RSS reading as well. But yeah, Feed Bin's got one too and then they've got
[02:08:25.440 --> 02:08:32.160]   their web app that you can use from anywhere. Okay. Wow. Now you got me, you know, I still use
[02:08:32.160 --> 02:08:37.680]   RSS every day all the time because that's how we do our beat checks. You know, that's how I look
[02:08:37.680 --> 02:08:43.040]   for news. You can follow people in Mastinon and RSS. You could follow YouTube channels in RSS.
[02:08:43.040 --> 02:08:49.360]   So having a good RSS reader is great. I love this idea of having my newsletters go to it though.
[02:08:49.360 --> 02:08:54.400]   Literally anything you can send via email you can stick in there which is pretty great.
[02:08:54.400 --> 02:08:59.040]   I really like that. Yeah. Feed Bin at Feed Bin dot com.
[02:08:59.040 --> 02:09:05.840]   Thank you, Mr. Snell. You'll find Jason at SixColors dot com is incomparable. Podcasts are

[02:09:21.600 --> 02:09:27.680]   Sure is. Here is talk about nerdy nerdy things that are not technology. Give yourself a break
[02:09:27.680 --> 02:09:33.040]   after listening to many tech podcasts. We are talking about fun stuff over there. So that's,
[02:09:33.040 --> 02:09:39.440]   you know, it's all good stuff. You can find something that you care about. If it's a movie or a TV
[02:09:39.440 --> 02:09:43.920]   show or whatever, you can find something about it over there. Or just actual play D&D.
[02:09:43.920 --> 02:09:48.960]   Total party kill. We play D&D on the internet. We're not using Zoom ISO yet, but we will probably
[02:09:48.960 --> 02:09:56.160]   very soon because we roll like that. Thank you, Alex. Yeah. Yeah. It's cool. Zoom ISO is awesome.
[02:09:58.080 --> 02:10:03.040]   As soon as we use it, and even if we don't use it, the singing before we use it is fantastic.
[02:10:03.040 --> 02:10:08.240]   That's the best. Thank you, Andy. Enocho, WGBH in Boston. When can we hear you there?
[02:10:08.240 --> 02:10:16.160]   Thursday at 1230. I'm at the BPL studio. So come on down to the BPL and watch it live. Or if you
[02:10:16.160 --> 02:10:20.400]   can't come into Boston on Thursday afternoon, the day before Labor Day, the day before
[02:10:20.400 --> 02:10:27.520]   Veterans Day, go to WGBHNews.org to stream the audio live or later. Or go to the WGBH News
[02:10:27.520 --> 02:10:32.880]   YouTube channel to also see the video streamed live or later. Nice. Thank you, Andy.
[02:10:32.880 --> 02:10:39.920]   Mr. Alex Lindsey, boy, you got to check out officehours.global. His amazing world swallowing
[02:10:39.920 --> 02:10:49.200]   thing. Sabado Gigante. What's up on office hours these days?
[02:10:49.200 --> 02:10:54.320]   You know, we had a great session because ZoomTopia is this week. Like when Apple does something,
[02:10:54.320 --> 02:10:59.280]   it's a lot of Apple stuff. This week we're thinking a lot about Zoom. So we had actually
[02:10:59.280 --> 02:11:05.120]   someone who's building entire events and has built this whole OBS platform using the SDK. So
[02:11:05.120 --> 02:11:08.960]   he was on this morning talking through that. Tomorrow we're going to talk about what we saw in the
[02:11:08.960 --> 02:11:13.680]   keynote. Thursday, members, Andy and other folks from the Zoom team are actually going to come on
[02:11:13.680 --> 02:11:20.320]   and answer our questions. And then on Friday, we're talking, we've made a big move last weekend,
[02:11:20.320 --> 02:11:24.800]   which is that we had a small rack and we had to move all the hardware that runs our show to a
[02:11:24.800 --> 02:11:29.520]   large rack. And of course, because we're on every day, we had 24 hours to do it or really more like
[02:11:29.520 --> 02:11:33.920]   22 hours to do it, not that we were counting. And that all went well. But we're going to talk
[02:11:33.920 --> 02:11:37.520]   about that. We're going to talk about what we're doing with our what we call office hours 2.5,
[02:11:37.520 --> 02:11:42.240]   which is, you know, us adding, you know, fully integrating all the Zoom ISO stuff. So we have
[02:11:42.240 --> 02:11:47.120]   all the isolated feeds so that we can, you know, re sync, re sync everybody's audio,
[02:11:47.120 --> 02:11:51.920]   have control over all of those bits and pieces. So that's our, that's kind of our next, our next
[02:11:51.920 --> 02:11:57.360]   thing. It's the R&D lab for everything we do here. That's for sure. We, you know, we have a lot of
[02:11:57.360 --> 02:12:04.080]   fun. You must watch office hours dot global for more information or for an invite to join the show
[02:12:04.080 --> 02:12:11.280]   live as a participant. And of course, if you want a higher Alex 090 dot media is the, is the
[02:12:11.280 --> 02:12:17.680]   business, the business end of the stick. Thanks to Andy Carlecio from Zoom, who has helped us a lot
[02:12:17.680 --> 02:12:22.480]   with his zoom ISO. He came by Friday and he's a pretty smart guy. Yeah, we really appreciate his
