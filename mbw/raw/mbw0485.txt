[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.840]   Some big deals, including a very big deal with Tete.
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.280]   It's all coming up next.

[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.760]   And there is zero.
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.480]   But actually, you know, there's more than we think.
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:55.160]   Let's introduce the panel and then we'll dig right into this starting with Andy Inako
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.000]   and his brand new Fez.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.800]   They call him a Sheppo.
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.960]   And by the way, I'm so grateful to the Fezorama folks because what you ran into him, right?
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:05.960]   At a Comic-Con?
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.760]   Yeah, at the New York Comic-Con.
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.960]   And he showed you his new Sheppo design.
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:18.480]   He showed me the Sheppo and I was like, if he had had them at that booth for my big melon,
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.160]   I would have bought like three of them.
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.160]   And so...
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.160]   But it didn't fit, right?
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.320]   Didn't fall because...
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.720]   I think he only had a few and he only had like mediums and like I said, I got this huge
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:28.720]   melon.
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.800]   So, but yeah, thank you for my official Twitch Sheppo.
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:39.200]   Well he redesigned them on with your input to fit.
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.840]   I don't know what stage the design was.
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.920]   The ones that I was trying on, they sat a little bit high, like a little bit more Fez-like.
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.920]   But again, this is always the way that when I saw that design, that's the way I always
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.120]   imagined it like sitting.
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.520]   He just got a slightly rakish angle like that.
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.360]   I think exactly right.
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.120]   And he does offer these, I'm trying to find it here, but he does offer these Twitch Fez-as
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.120]   on his...
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.120]   I saw him last night.
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.360]   As a matter of fact, when it arrived yesterday, I liked it so much that I thought, okay, well
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.680]   I should probably buy a second or a third one because if I wear this around the office
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.280]   because I enjoy it, I'm probably going to mess it up and then I'm going to want to have
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.160]   one for weddings and weddings and formal occasions, that's always perfect.
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.960]   So under special editions, they have the traditional Twitch Fez with gold tassel and
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:32.400]   the logo and then they have a low profile and then this new one, the Twitbrick, Ashipo.
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.920]   And by the way, he made for all of our hosts.
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:35.920]   Renee, you're going to get one.
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.080]   Jim, you'll get one too.
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.080]   He made for our hosts.
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.160]   And you've got Andy and an Amel, Twit pin.
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.160]   Yeah.
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.160]   It's like hold your tassel.
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.320]   It's around the tassel here.
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.840]   To tie your tassel down.
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:46.840]   Yeah.
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:47.840]   Nice.
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:48.840]   Civilized human.
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.720]   It's a nice thing.
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.200]   It is actually a pin.
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.200]   So if you want to make, if you know you're coming to an organization of very twitchy political
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.400]   people, just wear this on your lapel and don't explain what it means and just see if they
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.400]   just all freak out about you.
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.400]   And then when do you win?
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.400]   I knew you would.
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.400]   I knew you would.
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.880]   Kind of secret handshake or something when they try and shake your hand.
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.480]   Thank you to, I can't remember his name.
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.520]   Maybe I do this every time, our two friends from Fez and Rama for doing that.
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:25.520]   And because you're in Canada, Renee, yours probably is being held at customs for inspection.
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.840]   But I'll get 1.3 of them when they arrive.
[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.720]   And because Jim Dowl, you're in a San Jose.
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:33.960]   I don't know what.
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.400]   I want to make sure you're on the list.
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.280]   Maybe you're our newest regular.
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.280]   No, no, no, no.
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.280]   You don't have to find your house.
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.280]   Yeah.
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.280]   Anyway.
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.040]   Oh, that's Jim Dowrymple.
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.320]   My God, from the lulik.
[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.320]   Loop insight.com.
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.480]   Look at him.
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.240]   You would look so good in a Fez, Jim, with that beard.
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.960]   I'm telling you, you just you need that.
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.560]   You should have a linen suit as well.
[00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.520]   The Fez and the God.
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.280]   Can you imagine the black bird has escaped?
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.520]   Oh, you'd be great.
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.720]   A thin Sydney green street.
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:08.720]   Awesome.
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.000]   Let me buy you a drink.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.800]   We have much that we must despise.
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.720]   But I don't know, Rick.
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.720]   You're ship always so beautiful.
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.400]   Sydney's Alrable now from the loop.
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.760]   I might not say anything.
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.040]   I'll just sit there and look at you.
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.480]   Exactly right.
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.240]   Exactly right.
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.640]   Awesome.
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:37.040]   And they're Richie from iMour.com and Montreal.
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.640]   It looks a little chilly up there.
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:39.640]   Are you getting chilled?
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:40.640]   No.
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:41.840]   It's unseasonably warm.
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.000]   I don't know what's going to happen, Leo.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.560]   We're going to be flooded by the polarized caps any minute.
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.560]   So the--
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.200]   Apple stock.
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:48.880]   No, no.
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.840]   Apple stock not soaring.
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.440]   GoPro stock soaring.
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.160]   I probably wouldn't affect the Apple stock on rumors
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.600]   that Apple may just buy the whole damn thing.
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:02.120]   Credible?
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.480]   I have no guess.
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:07.720]   Why would Apple buy GoPro?
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.640]   Of course, remember, I'm the one who said Apple would never
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:10.120]   buy beats.
[00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.200]   That's a phony rumor.
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.360]   So I'm the wrong guy to ask.
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.280]   I mean, there's just been so many changes in all the things
[00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:19.080]   that I think--
[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:20.520]   I would think that Apple would do.
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.080]   And five years ago, I'd definitely say, well,
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.480]   why would they want to get into such a niche accessory market?
[00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:28.040]   They do have a video distribution channel,
[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.520]   but I think Apple could build that just as easily.
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:31.760]   It's not as though it's--
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.240]   it's not like Vimeo or anything like that.
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:38.200]   So honestly, I have absolutely no idea.
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.160]   I wouldn't say yes, I wouldn't say no.
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.920]   Can't just talk about the maybe someone
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.800]   who just wanted to build a pro for, though.
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.040]   Yeah, I don't see how it really fits their business.
[00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:48.480]   Although they're doing-- GoPro is doing a drone.
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:53.000]   I mean, but couldn't Apple do all of these things?
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.160]   I don't know why Apple needs a drone.
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.360]   No, Apple doesn't need a drone.
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.560]   They don't need really a camera.
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.680]   And-- or I guess, you know, it might be--
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.360]   if I'm going to make a case for it,
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.280]   it would be similar to the Beats acquisition,
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:10.040]   a lifestyle acquisition, kind of a hip--
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:12.760]   a way of acquiring hipness.
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:14.960]   You know, Apple certainly has a very strong brand,
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:19.200]   but among youth, perhaps not as strong as among people,
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:23.360]   a little older, that's one of the excuses for the Beats
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.880]   acquisition and could well be a reason why it go--
[00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:29.120]   I mean, certainly GoPro is popular with the kids.
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.720]   And anybody wearing a squirrel suit?
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:33.440]   Ah.
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:34.880]   You like the squirrel suit?
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:36.840]   You want to fly in a squirrel suit?
[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:39.480]   Get the Apple Pro.
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.720]   Maybe Apple wants to reassure the Pro market
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.120]   that they're still involved.
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:44.880]   Well, it's just so confusing because someone could just
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:46.920]   merely want to move GoPro stock as well.
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:47.560]   Ah, that's exactly right.
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.120]   It's an easy way to do it.
[00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:49.560]   So--
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:50.560]   They moved it, but not a lot.
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:52.920]   I-- GoPro is already down almost--
[00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:56.200]   I think it was 82% over its peak this summer.
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:57.680]   Stock's been tumbling, so it would
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.680]   be a relatively expensive acquisition.
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:02.280]   And it only went back up 8% because of the rumor.
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:03.000]   All right.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:03.840]   We'll defer this.
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:05.480]   For working on camera stuff, and there's
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:07.120]   something super interesting that GoPro has.
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.600]   It doesn't even have to be GoPro's cameras.
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:10.120]   It could be a technology that they have that Apple thinks
[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:12.600]   would go well with their--
[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.680]   the camera company is really--
[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:15.880]   is PrimeSense, sorry.
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:17.560]   And the other camera technology they've been buying,
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.200]   then it might make sense for them.
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:22.840]   And that's where it would make sense exactly.
[00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:25.480]   And it's about technology not necessarily
[00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:30.080]   about a GoPro camera or what it's doing.
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:33.080]   So you make the case that the Beats acquisition was about,
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:36.280]   really, the streaming technology, not the headphones.
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:36.680]   And the towel.
[00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:38.480]   Oh, it definitely wasn't about the headphones.
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:40.600]   I'd make the argument it was more about Jimmy
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:41.320]   than anything.
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:41.960]   Yeah.
[00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:42.480]   Jimmy, I have--
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.100]   The headphones are frosting on the accessory
[00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:46.520]   pilot at Apple stores.
[00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:50.160]   There is a GoPro Apple Watch app, which actually is good,
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.080]   because if you want to control the GoPro
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:55.240]   while you're skateboarding.
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:56.440]   Yeah, while you're skateboarding, you really
[00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:58.120]   want to be like holding like this,
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:02.200]   and then having your other hand tied up like that.
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.640]   Problem, the reason GoPro stock--
[00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:05.800]   It'll make for a much more dramatic video, that's for sure.
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:07.200]   Yeah, as you tumble.
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.920]   The reason GoPro stock has been telling us,
[00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:10.720]   I would guess, is because there's a lot of competition.
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.400]   It's not hard to do what GoPro does.
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:14.120]   Really, GoPro is like Red Bull.
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:16.520]   It's an example of a company that makes essentially
[00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:20.760]   a commodity product, that it makes sexy--
[00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.280]   like Beats headphones, too, frankly,
[00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:24.400]   that it makes sexy by virtue of its positioning
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:25.520]   and advertising.
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:27.160]   It's Marslelet-ly.
[00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:30.760]   Stock's not been doing well.
[00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:33.480]   Well, all this stuff you've got to phase out five years ahead
[00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:35.120]   from now, what does GoPro look like?
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.080]   What do Beats look like?
[00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:37.200]   And then you can start to--
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.560]   if they are commodity, if they are going to go,
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:40.000]   if they are meaningless, then they
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.440]   going to try and get as much value from their company
[00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:43.480]   as they can now.
[00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:46.000]   What do you think, guys, the Beats acquisition?
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.680]   What do you think now?
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:49.480]   It's more than a year later.
[00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:53.320]   Good deal, Jim Dauerple.
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:55.880]   Oh boy, it may not be the best one to ask about this.
[00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:57.240]   You hate Apple Music.
[00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:59.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.840]   I don't hate it.
[00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:04.080]   I wish it was better.
[00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:04.440]   Yeah.
[00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:12.000]   And I wish that Apple had have taken more time
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   to get it right the first time.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.440]   And based on what I've seen, they just haven't.
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:24.120]   I mean, if you look at it, we're five months into Apple Music,
[00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:28.320]   and we just got the ability to download songs.
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:32.320]   And that was built into the app from the very beginning.
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.560]   It just never worked.
[00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:44.040]   And things like that, that's not the Apple that I've known
[00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:45.800]   over the last 20 years.
[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:51.000]   I want it to work.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.840]   I really do.
[00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:55.600]   And I continue to try.
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:11:00.480]   But there's still things in there that just make it
[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:03.480]   so that it doesn't work all that well.
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:08.560]   $3 billion August of last year, of course,
[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:12.080]   it was the foundation for Apple Music.
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.960]   And Apple does sell Beats headphones in its stores.
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:18.760]   In fact, Apple gave all its retail store employees Beats
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:19.760]   headphones.
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:20.800]   And subscription.
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:24.160]   And it means Apple Music subscriptions, which seems like--
[00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:25.440]   Let me give you guys a phase.
[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:27.240]   That's worth more than--
[00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:27.800]   Nine months.
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:28.300]   Not even a year.
[00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:30.120]   It's nine months, because an interesting amount of time.
[00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:31.080]   They didn't give in a year.
[00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:32.080]   They gave them nine months.
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:32.800]   It's nine months.
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:33.480]   Yeah.
[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:35.000]   Huh.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:35.880]   Interesting.
[00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:37.240]   $100.
[00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:40.280]   It's just hard to point out something that maybe it's not
[00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:44.680]   long enough for that investment to have real visible rewards.
[00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:47.640]   But no, there's nothing visible to me right now.
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:49.320]   Well, they acquired this wonderful brand.
[00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:51.720]   And that brand has enhanced Apple in some way.
[00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:55.800]   Or they acquired the roots of a music platform.
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:59.440]   And that music platform has taken off like a ball of fire.
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:00.400]   But it's possible.
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:02.000]   It's one of those, as Jim was saying.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.200]   I mean, you acquire the technology that you have.
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:07.720]   You acquire the people that they have.
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:10.240]   And that is something that years down the road
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:12.400]   will make them a stronger company.
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:15.120]   It does-- I mean, you think about how Google operates.
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.880]   And they are still an ad-based company.
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:20.320]   But they also have just investments in so many other
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:22.600]   companies and so many other fields.
[00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:25.760]   One thing that's kind of on my radar now is maybe one of the
[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:28.440]   many shifts that Apple is getting into is that they don't
[00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:31.560]   feel as though they have to necessarily make everything.
[00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:34.640]   But if there's money to be made and they could just simply
[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:37.600]   write a check and acquire an ownership stake in another
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:43.440]   company, imagine if it wasn't to acquire GoPro hardware or
[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:44.560]   technology or even people.
[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:47.080]   It was just that we feel as though if we own this company
[00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:48.240]   and we just simply let them--
[00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:51.880]   we create a new company that is nothing but for Apple
[00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:54.200]   investments and other companies.
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:55.360]   We could own GoPro.
[00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:57.920]   We could have leadership of GoPro.
[00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:59.520]   But it would still remain its own brand.
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:00.920]   We wouldn't have to redesign anything.
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:03.640]   And we wouldn't have to make it GoPro by Apple or anything
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:04.800]   like that.
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.000]   I'm not suggesting that's what they're doing.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.960]   But it's something that in my new sense of humility about
[00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:14.560]   saying, myself, you know nothing about Apple, you can't
[00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:16.440]   predict anything about what they would do under any
[00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:17.560]   circumstances.
[00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:19.760]   At least I have to start considering stuff like that.
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:21.960]   I don't have to tell myself that people tell me.
[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:25.320]   Of what Apple does though, usually when they acquire a
[00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:30.960]   company, it's for a specific technology that they want to
[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:33.720]   build into something that they already have.
[00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:38.280]   So in the GoPro, range, that's what I would think.
[00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:40.440]   I don't know if there's any company that they really
[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:44.960]   bought over the last little while.
[00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:47.800]   It's just a company by Apple just because they--
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:49.720]   >> Filemakers the last one, I think.
[00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:50.720]   >> What?
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:53.320]   >> Filemakers probably the last one.
[00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:57.520]   >> Well, I mean, yeah, and that was in like 1860.
[00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:00.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:03.520]   >> Yeah, I mean, as far as GoPro goes, I think that it smells
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:06.080]   more like someone trying to influence the stock or anything
[00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:07.840]   else, it just doesn't make any sense.
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:11.360]   But all I'm saying is that there are times five years ago
[00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:12.360]   when I would have--
[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:14.880]   I feel as though Apple, what they would do at any
[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:16.960]   circumstance would be a lot more--
[00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:20.520]   was a lot more predictable than the Apple of today.
[00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:21.520]   And so--
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:22.520]   >> That's right.
[00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:24.720]   >> If I'm making the pie chart of things that are possible,
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:28.120]   now there's at least a visible sliver of maybe they just want
[00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:30.520]   to own the company because they think it's a good product
[00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:32.520]   and they want to start making money in that space.
[00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:36.720]   I don't think it's likely, but it just goes to show how much
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:38.280]   Apple has changed that your point--
[00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:40.560]   I'm willing to consider stuff that I would have thought would
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:43.200]   be silly for all the reasons that Jim mentioned a minute ago.
[00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:45.480]   You're not going to do what I did with Beats.
[00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:47.840]   You're smarter than that.
[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:49.240]   >> Never, never.
[00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:50.080]   >> I still--
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:51.080]   >> I still--
[00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:52.920]   >> It's popular brand, but I just--
[00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:56.080]   and so on showed me there are $250 Beats headphones just
[00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:57.200]   two weeks ago.
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:02.800]   And it's like I've had $300 headphones and really expensive
[00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:03.160]   headphones.
[00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:06.800]   And I'm not an audio file, but I feel as though I can hear
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:09.800]   the difference between-- that extra $150 or $200
[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:14.440]   will get you between that and my bog standard Sony
[00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:15.880]   studio headphones here.
[00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:19.120]   And these cost me about $60.
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:21.400]   I really couldn't tell the difference between these
[00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:24.360]   and those $250 Beats, whereas I can tell the difference
[00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:29.120]   between ones that are supposedly as good but it's
[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:30.200]   the same amount of money.
[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:32.920]   So I still don't get Beats, but--
[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:36.160]   >> Jim, do you wear headphones?
[00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:37.320]   >> I do.
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:39.600]   >> I would bet you're kind of an audio file.
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:42.200]   What do you recommend anything?
[00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:45.560]   >> I use Futuresonix.
[00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:46.840]   >> OK, and every one of those.
[00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:47.680]   OK, good.
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:50.720]   >> Futuresonix are the original--
[00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:55.880]   I think actually you may be using the in ear where--
[00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:57.120]   >> Yeah, I'm using it.
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:00.720]   >> --we're using it to the ear ear.
[00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:03.920]   The guy who made Futuresonix invented those.
[00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:07.720]   >> Ah, way back.
[00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:09.640]   He is the original.
[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:12.680]   When you hear your monitor, your monitor
[00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:17.520]   is a trademarked product of Futuresonix.
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:22.760]   So they are the absolute best on the market.
[00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:26.400]   There is nothing better.
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:28.160]   I know that there are other companies
[00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:31.440]   that make those ear monitors or try
[00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:38.520]   to make the in ear monitors like Marty does at Futuresonix.
[00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:42.760]   But none of them are as good as what he does.
[00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:46.400]   >> Yeah, because I had Ultimate Ears, which was the better
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:50.520]   known brand name, obviously copying Futuresonix.
[00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:53.280]   And then the guy who was that Ultimate Ear
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:54.760]   left after Logitech bought them.
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:56.680]   And now these are from JH Audio.
[00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:57.480]   Same idea.
[00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:00.200]   Molded, you have to go to audiologist.
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:02.240]   And they pour wax in your ear or something.
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:05.040]   >> It's the technology even inside.
[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:06.440]   >> Yeah, the drive-ups.
[00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:07.320]   >> Yeah.
[00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:10.320]   That makes Marty so much better.
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:12.400]   >> Yeah, I was disappointed, actually, in the audio on these.
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:14.360]   These were very expensive.
[00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:19.360]   And, you know, hey, six drivers, they sound muddy.
[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:21.240]   >> So, yeah.
[00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:25.440]   And I guarantee you, if you tried the Futuresonix--
[00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:27.440]   >> I will.
[00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:30.240]   >> You will be amazed at the sound quality.
[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:34.360]   I mean, I have literally heard things in songs
[00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:37.520]   that I've been listening to for 30 years
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:39.720]   that I hadn't heard before.
[00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:43.480]   And the thing is with the technology
[00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:47.720]   and the way that Marty designs the drivers,
[00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:50.800]   you don't have to have the music up as loud.
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:51.720]   >> Right.
[00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:53.640]   And that's what you want, right?
[00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:54.440]   >> Right.
[00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:56.800]   You know, you've got great bass.
[00:17:56.800 --> 00:18:00.200]   You've got clarity like you wouldn't believe.
[00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:03.120]   And, you know, when you put in the Apple headphones,
[00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:07.000]   you always, you know, sometimes you get a good song on there
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.920]   and you wish you could turn it up
[00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:10.480]   just another couple of notches
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:12.560]   just to crank the music up.
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:13.400]   >> Yeah.
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:16.520]   >> Well, with Futuresonix, I actually have it, you know,
[00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:19.320]   at that point, and it's still only three quarters
[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:20.160]   of the way up.
[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:21.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.640]   >> You know, so there's lots of room
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:26.320]   and the clarity of the sound that you're hearing
[00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:27.160]   is incredible.
[00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:29.480]   Now they have the year monitors,
[00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:30.560]   which are,
[00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:36.280]   those are, I think, about $1,200.
[00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:37.640]   >> Yeah, that's about--
[00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:39.120]   >> Those are very high-end.
[00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:40.600]   Now, they also have
[00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:46.920]   more consumer-oriented model, GS10.
[00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:47.760]   And--
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:48.880]   >> They look more like Ettomodix.
[00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:51.760]   They're kind of, you don't have to mold them.
[00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:52.960]   >> But you can, if you want.
[00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:53.840]   >> Oh, you can, huh?
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:56.880]   >> Yeah, they have foam earpieces
[00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:58.520]   that you can put in your ears.
[00:18:58.520 --> 00:18:59.360]   >> Right.
[00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:01.240]   >> But you can also go to an audiologist,
[00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:03.520]   which I've done with a set of these,
[00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:04.840]   the previous set,
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:06.760]   and had a mold made
[00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:09.840]   and put these headphones,
[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:11.240]   'cause it's just a post.
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:14.040]   But the drivers and the technology and everything,
[00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:16.120]   you know, it's still high-end stuff,
[00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:18.080]   but they're only a couple hundred bucks.
[00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:20.680]   So if you have a choice to go,
[00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:23.000]   you're gonna spend a couple hundred dollars
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.440]   on a set of headphones,
[00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:28.520]   then I would buy the GS10s.
[00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:30.840]   >> I've been buying Ettomodix in this style.
[00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:31.720]   I'm gonna, in the next set,
[00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:34.000]   I'll buy it, I'll get some of these spectrums.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.280]   >> Okay, well, you need to stop buying that stuff
[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:37.520]   and get a good set.
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:39.160]   >> I like Ettomodix, really?
[00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:40.400]   Is that, oh, really?
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:41.240]   Okay.
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:42.080]   >> Oh, yeah.
[00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:42.920]   >> Oh, good.
[00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:44.560]   >> And that's it, there is just,
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:48.160]   there is no comparison on the market.
[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:49.360]   >> Oh, exciting.
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:50.960]   >> 'Cause I have a set of these, too.
[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:51.800]   >> Yeah.
[00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:53.640]   >> And they're amazing.
[00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:54.640]   >> Okay.
[00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:55.920]   >> Talk me into it.
[00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:58.680]   >> Just go, just right now, just go buy them
[00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:00.280]   because you will tell them.
[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:01.120]   (laughing)
[00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:01.960]   >> Now, they don't make,
[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:03.200]   it's one of the things Ettomodix does,
[00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:05.120]   they make them with microphones,
[00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:09.280]   so you can use it in replacement for your Apple phone.
[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:11.720]   >> Yeah, and people, people have asked me about that
[00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:15.080]   with the future sonic stuff, and honestly,
[00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:18.480]   I mean, when you look at future sonic,
[00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:20.280]   and the things that they do,
[00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:25.280]   everything that they do is about audio quality
[00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:28.240]   going into your ears, and safety, too.
[00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:33.240]   They also support here, which is a foundation to support
[00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:40.560]   hearing, and hopefully not hearing loss.
[00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:47.160]   And I mean, future sonic does the,
[00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:52.040]   they engineer the cable going from your music player,
[00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:54.240]   your iPhone, or whatever, up to your ears,
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:57.800]   so that when you touch it, it's not making noise,
[00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:01.120]   and they just do everything, everything, everything,
[00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:01.960]   everything.
[00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:05.080]   >> I will order a pair based on your recommendation.
[00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:05.920]   >> Do it.
[00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:06.800]   >> Yes.
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:09.480]   I guarantee you will not be unhappy with them.
[00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:10.800]   You will love them.
[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:14.360]   >> You have any hoverboard recommendations?
[00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:15.240]   (laughing)
[00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:16.320]   >> Yes, don't get one.
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:17.360]   >> Okay, thank you very much.
[00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:19.280]   Jim Dowerim, everybody.
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:23.000]   Hey, I are evil IRC, and are not so evil IRC.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.080]   Chatroom says, this is why Renee, it's nine months.
[00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:29.480]   Three months free plus nine months makes a year.
[00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:30.320]   >> Ah, okay.
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:32.680]   >> So they, so it doesn't take you off.
[00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:33.520]   >> Yeah, it makes sense.
[00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:34.640]   They're topping you off.
[00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:35.680]   Let's take a break, we'll come back.
[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:38.280]   There's lots more Apple music news.
[00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:40.880]   Other stuff, too, coming up in just a bit.
[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:43.240]   I'm going to buy these future sonics.
[00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:45.080]   I think you talked.
[00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:46.520]   Santa Jim has spoken.
[00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:50.280]   >> I actually like headphones because I like to listen
[00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:53.320]   on airplanes and, you know, I don't want to crank up
[00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:55.360]   the music too loud in the house.
[00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:58.000]   So I have, I'm kind of a headphone fanatic,
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.840]   but I've never even heard of these guys, so get them.
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:05.200]   >> Our show today brought to you by Slack.
[00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:08.880]   If you're a developer, I know you know the name Slack.
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:12.280]   I think even lots of people in just normal life
[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:13.040]   know the name Slack.
[00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:17.240]   Sarah Lane has friends who use Slack
[00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:19.760]   instead of any other messenger
[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:21.520]   as their like personal messenger.
[00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:23.400]   'Cause it's so good, it's so good, it's so fun.
[00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:25.280]   It's so easy to use, but it's really intended
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:27.960]   for creating teams for productivity.
[00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:30.640]   It's really about replacing email,
[00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:32.920]   which is clearly broken.
[00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:35.280]   With a system that keeps you in touch,
[00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:37.840]   puts all your work communications in one place,
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:40.480]   integrates all the tools you use
[00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:43.240]   and services you use right into it.
[00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:44.680]   It's designed to make your work life
[00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:46.160]   simpler, more pleasant, more productive.
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:48.360]   And I think really that's a high testimonial
[00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:50.720]   if people use it, but they're for fun too.
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:53.920]   I've seen teams transition to Slack from,
[00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:57.360]   like we do, we use it with our web design team
[00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:59.160]   from a siloed collection of communication tools
[00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:01.240]   they put together, you know, you've seen it.
[00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:04.240]   Oh, we got email for this, I am for this Skype for this.
[00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:05.880]   Putting all these conversations
[00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:09.040]   which are spread out all over into a single organized,
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:13.000]   searchable view helps decisions get made faster
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.360]   and also increases transparency.
[00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:17.040]   There's a record, but it's not, you know,
[00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:20.560]   you can control that, you have ultimate control.
[00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:22.440]   This was created by Stuart Butterfield.
[00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:24.120]   Remember, Flickr, right?
[00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:27.320]   He's the guy who created Flickr, left Yahoo
[00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:29.520]   and kind of thought about things
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:31.120]   for a couple of years and created Slack
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:33.340]   and it's taken over the world.
[00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:35.840]   Probably because of all the integrations,
[00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:37.960]   nearly 100 integrations including Dropbox,
[00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:42.120]   GitHub, Trello, MailChimp, Google Drive, Hangouts.
[00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:45.800]   You can drag and drop to share files, images, PDFs.
[00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:47.400]   I do this all the time.
[00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:49.280]   We're doing this with the web team.
[00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:51.920]   I'd make an animated GIF of the screenshot
[00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:53.240]   and I drag that in.
[00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:57.000]   Oh yeah, and it's also a lot of fun
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.480]   because of the various bots.
[00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:03.000]   We had an Alex Trebek bot that you could play Jeopardy with.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   There's a Jiffy bot that puts animated GIFs
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.520]   in the stream when anybody says,
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:11.600]   for instance when somebody says, that's nice,
[00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:14.840]   it bit me, Borat shows up.
[00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:17.120]   It's fun, that's the point.
[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:20.760]   It's fun, it's enjoyable and it really gets things done.
[00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:22.840]   They're more than one and a quarter million active users
[00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:24.720]   every single day.
[00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:26.760]   And of course it's cross-platform iOS
[00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:29.520]   but also Android, Mac, Windows,
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:33.080]   big companies, government agencies use Slack, NASA,
[00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:36.760]   universities like MIT, the Wall Street Journal,
[00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:40.200]   Salesforce, Zappos, eBay, Dow Jones, Airbnb, Expedia,
[00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:42.560]   and to it Samsung, if I read the whole list,
[00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:43.680]   we'd be out of here.
[00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:44.920]   It'd be sunset.
[00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:47.320]   Slack recently surveyed their customers
[00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:50.720]   and found out that they report, the customers report,
[00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:53.320]   a 32% productivity increase,
[00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:56.720]   a 48.6% reduction in internal email,
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:59.160]   mine is a larger than that.
[00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:01.600]   God, I don't wanna use email at all, I love Slack.
[00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:04.480]   25.1% fewer meetings.
[00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:06.600]   That's enough to sell it right there for me.
[00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:11.080]   You could try it for you right now at slack.com/macbreak.
[00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:13.320]   You'll also get a $100 credit toward a paid plan
[00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:18.320]   when you convert, but you have to go to slack.com/macbreak.
[00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:24.280]   Teams of all kinds love Slack.
[00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:25.600]   I know you will too, I love it.
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:29.600]   Slack.com/macbreak, we thank you for their support.
[00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:30.440]   Macbreak.
[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:31.560]   Weekly.
[00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:33.280]   You run mobile nations off Slack, it's amazing.
[00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:34.120]   Yeah.
[00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:37.240]   It's really interesting, 'cause now, of course,
[00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:39.880]   it's kind of everybody, I think you don't have to explain
[00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:42.520]   why this is better than other forms of communication.
[00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:45.360]   But when Stewart did this, it was like a light bulb
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:48.120]   went off for people, it was like, wow,
[00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:50.440]   it really is a huge improvement.
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:56.280]   Speaking of Apple Music, some Apple Music in the news,
[00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:59.360]   I saw an ad yesterday for the Taylor Swift concert,
[00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:02.800]   I was watching what else, The Voice,
[00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:05.200]   and Apple got a big exclusive.
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:08.400]   They got Taylor Swift to release her,
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:11.600]   now 1989, the World Tour is over, the album is out,
[00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:14.440]   but if you didn't get to see the concert,
[00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:17.800]   December 20th, Apple has exclusive rights to the video
[00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:21.160]   and a big Apple Music marketing campaign,
[00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:23.800]   which I think I saw one of the first ads.
[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:24.640]   It was an ad in the story,
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:25.480]   onto the story of the other day,
[00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:27.400]   and it was part of where the shelf of all the headphones
[00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:30.400]   were, that was a big four by four Taylor Swift plaque.
[00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:31.240]   - It's interesting.
[00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:32.480]   - It's never seen before in the retail.
[00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:33.320]   - Yeah.
[00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:34.280]   - Isn't it interesting?
[00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:38.800]   I mean, she was the one who famously on Tumblr said,
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:40.680]   I love Apple, but get it together,
[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:43.160]   and that was about the free tier, I think, right?
[00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:44.400]   What was it about, I forgot?
[00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:46.440]   Oh yeah, the first three months they were gonna play artists,
[00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:47.280]   right?
[00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:50.160]   So, immediately, Eddie Q that day called,
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:51.960]   it was a Sunday called Taylor Swift on a Sunday,
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:54.640]   he said, I'm so sorry, Taylor, please don't do that.
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:56.920]   And then changed the rules, and maybe at that time,
[00:26:56.920 --> 00:27:00.080]   Eddie said, and if ever we can do anything for you,
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:02.720]   like give you millions of dollars for an exclusive,
[00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:03.760]   just let me know.
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:07.320]   This is the kind of thing you need
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:09.360]   to make Apple music succeed, yes?
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:12.560]   - I know.
[00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:14.320]   - And the point I have is that there's different
[00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:16.480]   constituent parts, like when Jim mentioned
[00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:17.480]   they hired them for the talent,
[00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:19.480]   you get Trent Reznor and Hebrew gives you Beats One,
[00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:22.040]   so there's Beats One, which I think is pretty good.
[00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:24.080]   Many people complain about mistakes with Beats One
[00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:25.160]   or problems with Beats One.
[00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:26.480]   It just kind of plays there,
[00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:29.280]   and then you have the Apple music service.
[00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:31.280]   But I think Taylor Swift is what you do to get people
[00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:33.760]   to try it maybe, who maybe have had stated
[00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:35.360]   to try it for now.
[00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:40.360]   - Look, what Apple needs to do to get this to work
[00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:45.240]   is to fix the F.
[00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:46.600]   - Make the make it work.
[00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:47.600]   - Yeah.
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:49.920]   - Once it works, people will use it.
[00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:51.440]   - You know what Jim, I'm gonna disagree with you
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:53.400]   and I'm at my peril, 'cause I know you could
[00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:58.400]   eat me with your beard, but most people are not like you.
[00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:01.320]   Most people don't own music.
[00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:04.840]   Most people use Apple music to supplant their music collection.
[00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:06.280]   That's how they listen to music,
[00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:08.720]   and for them, the experience is not like
[00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:10.720]   your experience at all, right?
[00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:13.680]   - Well, if that's the case,
[00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:16.320]   then if you come to Apple music with nothing,
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:18.720]   with no music, then you're probably gonna have
[00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:20.080]   a pretty good experience.
[00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:21.160]   - And I think that's when they're aiming at it.
[00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:22.560]   - I'll admit that, yeah.
[00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:28.560]   And if the goal is to buy subscribers,
[00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:35.920]   because you have a superstar video that you pay for,
[00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:39.640]   then okay, and if that's more important
[00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:44.000]   than making the service work, then great.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   - Well, it isn't.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:49.840]   I'm sure Apple would like to get Jim Tower ball up their back
[00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:53.480]   and fix the portion of Apple music that doesn't work for you,
[00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:56.040]   which is integration with an existing library, right?
[00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:57.480]   - Well, and the rest of it.
[00:28:57.480 --> 00:28:59.320]   - And everything else.
[00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:01.480]   I mean, I'm not an Apple music subscriber,
[00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:04.160]   because I have Spotify and Google music,
[00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:08.040]   and actually Google music responded to Apple's 1499 family plan
[00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:10.880]   with their own version of that, which is basically identical.
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:14.600]   So thank you, Apple, for pushing these other guys.
[00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:17.040]   I'm sure Spotify will do the same thing.
[00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:21.040]   But I really think all three of these services are more geared.
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:23.800]   Well, Spotify, for instance, doesn't do any of that
[00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:26.800]   integrating of your existing music collection.
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:28.160]   - No music locker.
[00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:32.800]   - No, and I'm not saying that that's easy for Apple to do.
[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:36.120]   I'm sure that's extremely difficult for Apple to do.
[00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:41.440]   And the only reason I'm being hard on Apple
[00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:43.960]   is because I care so much about music,
[00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:45.960]   and I know that Apple can do better.
[00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:47.400]   I know that they can't.
[00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:50.560]   They released iTunes that changed the music industry.
[00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:55.560]   And to release Apple music in the state that it was
[00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:58.840]   and say, here are the things that you can do
[00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:03.840]   when you actually can't, that's wrong.
[00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:05.920]   It's wrong, it's wrong for them to do.
[00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:10.920]   It's wrong for them to put that out there.
[00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:14.360]   And basically, we beta tested it.
[00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:17.080]   It trashed a lot of our libraries.
[00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:19.080]   And they never called it a beta.
[00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:22.160]   Or else beta would have been good.
[00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:23.600]   Whatever it was.
[00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:26.000]   And that upsets me.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.640]   It does, it really does.
[00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:29.200]   - It should not change the name from Beats.
[00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:30.640]   - No, especially because iCloud Music,
[00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:32.240]   I grew up photo library launches a beta
[00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:33.640]   that had a very clear beta sign on that.
[00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:34.960]   They had a clear beta sign on Siri.
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:37.080]   They've had a clear beta sign on many of their products.
[00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:38.400]   And they could have well done with one.
[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:39.720]   - I would say Apple's photos
[00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:42.680]   has shared some of the same flaws that Apple Music does.
[00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:46.440]   I mean, that's where I have a similar experience to you, Jim.
[00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:48.040]   Missing photos.
[00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:52.920]   - See, for photos, and people will complain about photos,
[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:54.200]   that works great for me.
[00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:56.920]   But it's all in what you use.
[00:30:56.920 --> 00:31:01.920]   I mean, for me, I'm still finding bugs in Apple Music.
[00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:07.240]   And like I said before, the fact that we're five months
[00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:12.160]   into the service and we can finally download songs,
[00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:15.880]   that's not acceptable, not acceptable at all.
[00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:18.720]   And all this time, Apple's been working
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:20.720]   on getting Taylor Swift.
[00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:22.800]   To me, that's kind of like,
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:27.320]   I don't know, that distraction.
[00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:29.360]   Like look over here, don't look at our service
[00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:31.240]   'cause it doesn't work, but look over here.
[00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:32.080]   See what we got?
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:34.480]   Ooh, Taylor Swift, ooh.
[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:36.520]   I don't care.
[00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:39.600]   I wouldn't care if it was Aussie that they had.
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:41.240]   I want the service to work.
[00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:43.960]   - Well, and that's the interesting thing.
[00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:48.960]   - And then I'll look at whatever artists you wanna sign up
[00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:53.560]   and pay millions of dollars and do all that kind of stuff for.
[00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:55.920]   But right now, I could care less.
[00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:57.400]   I just wanted to work.
[00:31:57.400 --> 00:31:59.920]   - But as I said, I don't think you're an outlier.
[00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:01.520]   I think there's a significant number of people
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:02.360]   in your situation.
[00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:04.000]   I'm on in that situation
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.840]   'cause I have a large music collection.
[00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:08.600]   And I haven't had the problems you've had,
[00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:11.760]   but I of course, I'm not a subscriber to Apple Music.
[00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:13.520]   I continue to pay for iTunes Match,
[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:15.480]   which works okay for me right now.
[00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:20.000]   But I do think that most of the people they're aiming at
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:23.480]   are younger, they don't have big music collections.
[00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:26.640]   They're just using it as people use Spotify
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:28.040]   as a streaming music service
[00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:30.560]   that provides them all the music they want for rent.
[00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:31.400]   - Yeah.
[00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:36.200]   Then if that's the case, then my contention is,
[00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:39.960]   don't come out and tell me that I can bring my library
[00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:45.720]   and make a new app that is not part of iTunes.
[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:47.160]   And here is Apple Music.
[00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:49.160]   It's a streaming service.
[00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:51.960]   And if you wanna listen to your own music,
[00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:53.800]   you have iTunes.
[00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:55.240]   But they didn't do that.
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:58.080]   They said, you can bring your music library.
[00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:01.520]   You can do all this wonderful stuff and you can't.
[00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:02.360]   - Right.
[00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:06.160]   - So I'm not asking Apple Music to do anything
[00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:08.520]   that Apple didn't say it could do.
[00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:10.960]   But it can't do it.
[00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:11.800]   - Yeah, no, no.
[00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:13.840]   - So that's my problem.
[00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:17.960]   And if Apple had to come out in July and said,
[00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:23.440]   Apple Music cannot work with your existing library,
[00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:25.840]   but you can still play your iTunes stuff.
[00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:29.040]   And we have a streaming service here with radio
[00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:34.040]   and with Playlist and all of this great stuff.
[00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:38.560]   And you can listen to 35 million songs.
[00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:40.680]   I would have been fine.
[00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:42.640]   I would have been fine with that.
[00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:44.840]   But the fact that I put in
[00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:48.160]   Led Zeppelin One and Led Zeppelin Two
[00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:52.040]   from my own collection, put those into iTunes
[00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:55.800]   and Apple Music changes the name to Led Zeppelin Mothership,
[00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:57.800]   which is their greatest hits album.
[00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:00.640]   I don't, why?
[00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:04.600]   Why would you change the name of my albums
[00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:08.320]   to something that they're not?
[00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:09.560]   I don't understand that.
[00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:13.480]   And that just happened a few weeks ago.
[00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:15.840]   I mean, this stuff isn't old.
[00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:18.280]   I mean, this is still ongoing.
[00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:21.000]   And these are the problems that I have with it.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:25.480]   I just, I expect more care from Apple.
[00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:30.920]   I wonder if we're going to see a shooting war
[00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:35.480]   between Apple, Spotify, DZER, title.
[00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:39.640]   What was, it was title was, which one was the JZ one
[00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:41.040]   that had the line up of stars.
[00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:42.840]   Wasn't that all about getting exclusives?
[00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:44.600]   I don't see that happening, by the way.
[00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:46.680]   Getting exclusives with all these stars.
[00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:47.760]   I hope we don't see that.
[00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:50.200]   I don't want to see the siloing of music where,
[00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:52.200]   oh, well, if you want Beatles music, you need iTunes.
[00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:54.840]   But if you want, and if Taylor Swift, you need iTunes,
[00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:55.960]   but if you want Rolling Stones,
[00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:57.760]   you got to go to Spotify.
[00:34:57.760 --> 00:34:59.920]   Situation like that is not good for music.
[00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:02.600]   Although I can see that happening.
[00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:04.480]   I'm sure.
[00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:06.760]   I don't know if I see that happening only because
[00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:08.560]   if you're at this sort of level
[00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:11.040]   where you can swing that kind of exclusivity deal,
[00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:12.200]   you're also smart enough to know
[00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:13.840]   that it is not your best interest a lot.
[00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:14.680]   It's temporary.
[00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:15.680]   Yeah.
[00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:18.640]   You're a platform, particularly one that is only,
[00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:21.280]   that's on a mobile platform that's very, very lucrative,
[00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:25.280]   but you're basically leaving a lot of,
[00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:27.240]   you're not just leaving a lot of listeners,
[00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:28.600]   a lot of money on the table.
[00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:30.280]   You're leaving behind a lot of the listeners
[00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:33.440]   who aren't in the uppermost economic classes.
[00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:34.960]   And unless you can tell yourself
[00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:37.040]   that every single one of your users
[00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:42.040]   can afford to buy a $600 to $800 premium luxury brand phone,
[00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:46.000]   you have to acknowledge the other sides of the market.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.200]   Although the Android music, excuse me,
[00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:51.480]   the Android version of the Apple Music app is working great.
[00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:53.640]   There's always going to be a question as to,
[00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:56.680]   we're trying to move people onto a different platform.
[00:35:56.680 --> 00:36:00.120]   The, it's very strange.
[00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:03.280]   I mean, Apple will always have a really huge advantage
[00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:04.720]   in that it is the default app.
[00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:07.000]   It's the music app that comes pre-installed
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.400]   on all this different hardware.
[00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:10.440]   And so for that reason,
[00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:13.640]   I don't mean this to sound in a minimalizing way,
[00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:16.600]   but Apple Music doesn't have to perform
[00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:19.600]   at the same level as Spotify or as Pandora
[00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:21.040]   or as another one of these apps
[00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:23.400]   that people have to actually seek out and go get.
[00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:24.920]   It just has to be good enough
[00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:27.000]   that whoever started using it
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:30.120]   never has a really great reason to stop using it.
[00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:35.120]   And if this is a user that is happy to rent music from Apple
[00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:37.880]   and doesn't have a large library
[00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:40.400]   or even a medium-sized library to deal with,
[00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:42.560]   to begin with, it's possible they'll never get
[00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:44.320]   to that point of enough is enough.
[00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:46.280]   I'm mad as hell on, I'm not going to take it anymore,
[00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:47.600]   then get them onto the Apple store
[00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:49.720]   to start looking for alternatives.
[00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:51.440]   My biggest fear was always that it was going to be
[00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:53.160]   sort of split apart by labels.
[00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:56.120]   iTunes got a spoil because you can get artists
[00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:58.320]   from any label, you get movies from any studio.
[00:36:58.320 --> 00:36:59.640]   But then in the early days of comic books,
[00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:02.200]   it looked like you needed maybe a Marvel app and a DC app.
[00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:04.120]   And then maybe his Warner is going to make an app
[00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:05.400]   and you have to subscribe to Warner's
[00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:08.400]   to get their content and Disney's going to have their own app
[00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:10.400]   and then Universal Music will have theirs.
[00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:12.200]   And suddenly you're going to have to almost pay
[00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:14.760]   for every service as a direct from the label
[00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:16.040]   or studio service.
[00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:17.120]   It looks like we've dodged that,
[00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:18.320]   but in the back of my mind,
[00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:21.120]   we've seen carrier exclusives and platform exclusives,
[00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:23.760]   but my fear is that it's going to go to studio
[00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:25.000]   exclusivity at some point.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.840]   - Jim's not the only person who hates Apple Music,
[00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:30.240]   chief financial officer of Pandora,
[00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:35.200]   Mike Herring in an analyst call talking about
[00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:39.520]   Pandora's troubles, called to investors,
[00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:41.720]   said this quote about Apple Music.
[00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:44.040]   Apple spends a lot of their real estate on this phone
[00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:45.720]   trying to drive people to music.
[00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:46.880]   You can't even get it off.
[00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:50.240]   It's like a permanent thing on there and still,
[00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:52.200]   no one subscribes.
[00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:53.960]   Well, I guess a few million people do,
[00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:57.280]   but the reality is to get people to choose to do that
[00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:58.200]   is a much bigger trick.
[00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:00.800]   You have to have a great product.
[00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:03.200]   He said Pandora's trying to bring back the music in this.
[00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:04.920]   Remember Pandora's getting to the streaming business
[00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:08.320]   we think because they bought the intellectual property
[00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:10.440]   of the failed RDO.
[00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:11.280]   - Quote.
[00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:13.440]   - Go in, you'll love this quote, quote.
[00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:17.320]   I mean, Steve Jobs eviscerated the music industry
[00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:18.760]   with the launch of iTunes.
[00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:20.120]   I'm not sure people would agree with that.
[00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:22.040]   And it's been downhill ever since.
[00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:23.920]   And the download was supposed to save it
[00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:24.760]   and that didn't happen.
[00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:26.960]   Now on demand streaming is supposed to save it.
[00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:28.280]   We'll see if that happens.
[00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:30.400]   I think what really needs to happen is
[00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:31.560]   we need to think broadly,
[00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:34.960]   how do we drive engagement overall as a music industry?
[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:36.480]   And that message is starting to make sense.
[00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:38.720]   Well, no one questions that Taylor Swift
[00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:40.320]   is driving engagement.
[00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:42.560]   Some artists are good at that.
[00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:47.560]   - See, I think that this Pandora already has a story
[00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:53.000]   that the RDO thing is gonna cause Apple some problems.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.920]   And more problems than what I think Apple believes they will.
[00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:57.760]   - Interesting.
[00:38:57.760 --> 00:38:59.080]   They'll be a strong competitor.
[00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:00.800]   - I think they will.
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:02.160]   - Pandora's strong right now.
[00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:04.200]   It's number one, isn't it?
[00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:09.080]   - Pandora has the best algorithmic radio out there.
[00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:12.560]   I know that people use Spotify and people,
[00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:15.000]   I've tried everyone of them and tried Google.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:16.600]   I tried Deezer.
[00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:19.560]   I tried everything that's out there
[00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:24.560]   in my search for what's going on with Apple music.
[00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:28.520]   And Pandora is by far the best.
[00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:32.880]   And the thing that Pandora is missing
[00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:36.400]   is the on demand music, but they're gonna have that now.
[00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:41.400]   So when you take Pandora's quality of on demand radio
[00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:48.600]   and put that with the ability to have on demand music,
[00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:52.120]   I mean, that's gonna be killer.
[00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:54.840]   I pay for Pandora now.
[00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:57.360]   I pay for Apple music too.
[00:39:57.360 --> 00:40:02.080]   But I pay for Pandora now and it's pretty amazing.
[00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:05.160]   And the fact that I'll be able to go into Pandora
[00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:08.680]   and just say, yeah, I want these bands and artists
[00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:13.520]   and albums and songs, it's gonna hurt Apple.
[00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:17.440]   And I honestly don't believe at this point
[00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:20.560]   that Apple considers them to be any kind of a competitor
[00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:24.000]   because Apple has all these celebrities
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.280]   that it can bring to the table.
[00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:28.360]   But when it comes right down to it,
[00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:31.720]   people just want a service that will work.
[00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:35.160]   They, you know, the celebrities are fine,
[00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:38.520]   but if the service doesn't work like you expect,
[00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:42.600]   I mean, the other night, I was out
[00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:45.960]   and I went to play radio on Apple music
[00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:49.960]   and it came up and said, this format is not supported.
[00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:51.240]   - It's own format.
[00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:53.400]   - Its own format wasn't supported.
[00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:57.560]   So then I just started pressing radio stations, all of them.
[00:40:57.560 --> 00:40:59.320]   And I got the same message.
[00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:01.280]   This format is not supported.
[00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:05.960]   And I had coverage, you know, I wasn't in a non-coverage area.
[00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:11.800]   It just, this form, okay, well then I'll put on Pandora.
[00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:13.640]   - Mm-hmm. - It worked.
[00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:16.680]   In the same area, you know?
[00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:21.680]   So you can have as many celebrities as you want.
[00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:27.080]   But if you can't even play your own music format,
[00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:28.080]   you got a problem.
[00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:34.840]   - Mike Herring was a little apologetic after his outburst.
[00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:35.680]   I know how he feels.
[00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:39.200]   Sometimes you get, you know, you get lit and you get going
[00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:41.520]   and then you realize, oh my God, I'm on an analyst call.
[00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:42.720]   Just said that.
[00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:45.920]   He tweeted, although, I don't have Twitter's the right venue
[00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:46.960]   for this, but he tweeted,
[00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:49.800]   "Offering sincere apologies for my recent careless
[00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:53.040]   and inappropriate comments about Apple and Steve Jobs.
[00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:56.240]   Please know my own bone-headed comments
[00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:59.160]   don't reflect Pandora's perception of her partners
[00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:00.680]   and Apple.
[00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:01.720]   I feel terrible. - The only issue
[00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:03.120]   with those companies is they, again,
[00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:04.840]   I, when they don't have ancillary income,
[00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:07.200]   I worry about how long-term their viability is.
[00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:08.840]   And also Pandora's not done a great job
[00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:10.440]   of going international.
[00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:12.680]   The services like Spotify have done a much better job
[00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:14.440]   of moving to many more countries.
[00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:15.280]   - They started in the start.
[00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:16.120]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:17.840]   And I don't know how successful you can be.
[00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:19.440]   Like, I was just trying to find out what other countries
[00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:20.920]   they were in and I don't see any evidence
[00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:21.920]   that they're in many countries at all.
[00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:23.120]   - Do you have it in Canada?
[00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:23.960]   - Not as far as I can tell.
[00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:25.360]   - You don't have Pandora?
[00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:26.200]   - I don't think.
[00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:27.120]   We didn't have it for many, many years
[00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:28.200]   and I still see it still here now.
[00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:29.800]   - No, I don't think you do.
[00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:31.200]   - I think Slack made a huge effort,
[00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:32.760]   Slack made a huge effort to get here
[00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:33.800]   and Apple Music launched here
[00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:35.800]   and Google brought Google Music here last year, I think.
[00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:37.400]   Amazon has been bothered.
[00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:39.640]   - It's an issue of negotiating with the record labels, right?
[00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:40.480]   That's what you do.
[00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:42.800]   - Yeah, but again, Apple did 100 countries at launch
[00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:43.800]   and other companies like,
[00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:45.360]   they tell me and I believe them how hard it is
[00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:46.960]   to negotiate that stuff.
[00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:49.120]   And again, Amazon hasn't done a great job of it either,
[00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:50.400]   but if Apple can do 100 countries,
[00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:51.400]   I think other companies can do
[00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:52.240]   a set of at least the thoughts of it.
[00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:54.600]   - Is that Jimmy and I have been or Eddie Q?
[00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:55.600]   - Yes.
[00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:56.440]   (laughing)
[00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:57.280]   Or both.
[00:42:57.280 --> 00:42:59.520]   I got Jimmy online one, Eddie online two.
[00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:01.160]   Who do you wanna talk to?
[00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:02.480]   - Apple's always been one of the best
[00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:03.880]   at doing international support.
[00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:04.720]   - Yeah.
[00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:07.840]   - Well, they're Apple, they got their Apple, right?
[00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:12.480]   They got the clout and they got Iovine.
[00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:17.320]   Cloud and Iovine, it sounds like a law firm.
[00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:21.840]   Apple's also making some acquisitions.
[00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:25.600]   They bought a chip fab in North San Jose,
[00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:27.960]   although the chip experts say,
[00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:29.840]   not big enough probably to make chips,
[00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:32.200]   probably more for prototyping.
[00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:33.040]   Chips 18.
[00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:34.560]   - It's a small fab on a big process.
[00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:37.360]   - Yeah, 70,000 square foot building,
[00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:40.040]   which sounds big to me, but is not that big for a fab.
[00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:43.320]   18.2 million dollars is cheap if it's a,
[00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:44.840]   you know, it's not a production fab,
[00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:47.080]   but was a manufacturing facility
[00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:50.280]   for a small semiconductor company called Maxim.
[00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:52.640]   So.
[00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:55.120]   - And Apple's chip strong, what, 14 and 16 nanometer now?
[00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:57.680]   - Yeah, I wonder what the process, Maxim.
[00:43:57.680 --> 00:43:59.160]   - That's a 350 to 180.
[00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:03.120]   - Oh my God, bulk production of 350 nanometers, 180 nanometers.
[00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:06.160]   - What, they can go down to 90,
[00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:07.560]   but that's not state of the art anymore.
[00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:09.160]   So what, this is, yeah, you make sense though.
[00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:12.320]   You might prototype at a plant like that, right?
[00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:16.080]   We got the A9X, let's see what the A10 can do.
[00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:18.160]   You're gonna have to make a really big--
[00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:19.240]   - It's a stuff full of people
[00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:19.920]   'cause they're running out there,
[00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:20.800]   still running out of space.
[00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:23.040]   And I don't know what's next, putting people on platforms
[00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:24.560]   and helicoptering them out there every morning.
[00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:25.960]   - Yeah.
[00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:28.960]   Have they been fab-lessed up to now though, right?
[00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:31.680]   - Yeah, they design chips and they're fab by,
[00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:34.640]   yeah, Taiwan semiconductor or Samsung.
[00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:37.640]   - They have opened according to Bloomberg,
[00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:39.440]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:41.560]   they have opened a secret laboratory.
[00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:46.800]   Now we know, if it's in a mountain, all bets are off.
[00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:47.640]   - Okay, no.
[00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:50.600]   - Apple owns secret laboratory in Taiwan
[00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:53.920]   to develop new screens.
[00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:57.000]   That's interesting, it's a production lab
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:00.600]   where engineers, according to people with knowledge
[00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:03.800]   of the facility, are building or working on
[00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:06.640]   screens for iPhones and iPads.
[00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:08.960]   This is one area where Samsung really has had
[00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:09.960]   an advantage, haven't they?
[00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:12.680]   Because they make the OLEDs,
[00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:14.840]   they can reserve the best screens for themselves.
[00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:16.760]   And I think you could really argue that the Note 5
[00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:19.880]   and the S6 are the best screens on the market.
[00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:21.640]   They're really gorgeous screens.
[00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:22.680]   - It's a hard thing though,
[00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:25.120]   because Samsung also makes the chips for Apple
[00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:26.640]   and Samsung's chips, I think,
[00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:28.400]   and arguably aren't as good as Apple's right now.
[00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:30.880]   They ended up making, the design is very important too.
[00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:33.920]   Apple's a smart company, they're working on CPUs,
[00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:36.280]   GPUs, modems, almost everything that goes in that phone,
[00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:38.200]   they have at least a team exploring that.
[00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:39.440]   And I think at a certain point,
[00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:41.880]   you have to move to where that stuff is gonna be made
[00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:44.440]   and produced so that you can interface better with the,
[00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:45.280]   'cause I don't think they're gonna build
[00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:47.440]   a giant screen factory anytime soon, but--
[00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:50.480]   - Apple buys displays, not just from Samsung,
[00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:54.560]   but from LG, I think the cinematists plays are sharp,
[00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:55.840]   or were?
[00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:59.080]   - Yeah, and they send them multi-source from several companies.
[00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:02.080]   - So it makes sense, Apple's big enough,
[00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:04.560]   they should make everything what they'd like to.
[00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:07.040]   - So interestingly, 'cause right now,
[00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:08.760]   people say Apple's gonna go to OLED,
[00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:09.720]   because it makes a lot of sense,
[00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:11.960]   but then Touch ID, sorry, the 3D Touch now works
[00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:14.320]   on measuring the distance between LED back lights,
[00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:15.800]   and OLED doesn't really have that.
[00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:18.240]   And there's Quantum Dot looming on the future,
[00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:20.560]   which sort of has some of the advantages of OLED
[00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:22.360]   without the disadvantages, like longer life
[00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:23.840]   for all the different elements and things like that.
[00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:25.600]   And it's such an influx industry,
[00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:26.880]   I think it makes a ton of sense that Apple
[00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:28.560]   has really boots on the ground in an area
[00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:30.000]   where they can sort of have a hand
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:31.520]   in developing what they wanna use next.
[00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:33.800]   - Samsung's Galaxy S7 rumor has it,
[00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:37.520]   will have something, sounds a lot like 3D Touch.
[00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:43.000]   Maybe there's a way to do it with an OLED, I don't know.
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:43.840]   - The Macs do it differently,
[00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:45.160]   the Macs have four pressure centers,
[00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:46.440]   the watch has a difference,
[00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:48.240]   so I think the watch uses a horizontal mechanism,
[00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:49.160]   because it's such a small screen,
[00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:51.320]   you can shoot horizontally across it.
[00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:53.280]   So there's all these different ways of implementing it,
[00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:55.000]   which is, again, what makes it such an interesting point
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:56.400]   in time? - Yeah, yeah.
[00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:57.960]   - What do you have a bad thing for Samsung?
[00:46:57.960 --> 00:46:59.600]   Or at least, I think we would be a bad thing
[00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:03.360]   for Samsung users, without support from the core Google team,
[00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:05.560]   you'd basically be having an enhancement
[00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:08.280]   just to Samsung's skin on Android,
[00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:10.760]   which would be, in a way, would be good for Android
[00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:13.120]   because it would be, excuse me, good for Samsung,
[00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:14.920]   because it would be differentiating their phones
[00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:17.000]   from Nexus devices and other devices.
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:20.840]   But like a lot of things that Samsung puts into their phones,
[00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:23.240]   it really is like a closed cell.
[00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:26.320]   And you have something that only Samsung is kind of supporting,
[00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:28.400]   and only Samsung is developing.
[00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:31.000]   There's gonna be a limit to developer support
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:32.720]   from outside of that cell.
[00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:36.920]   And also, Samsung sometimes gets bored
[00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:41.920]   with fantastic ideas that they had in 2013 or 2014 and 2015.
[00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:44.960]   So it's possible that you might like this feature
[00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:46.960]   that you have in your Galaxy S7,
[00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:49.960]   but by the time the Galaxy S8 is rolled out,
[00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:52.560]   they decided that it wasn't worth adding the hardware for it,
[00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:55.400]   and then you're basically, are stuck on this one island.
[00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:58.640]   So unless it's supported by Core Android,
[00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:00.160]   I just don't see that as being a good thing
[00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:01.760]   for users in general.
[00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:05.920]   - And one more music story,
[00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:06.760]   and then we'll move on.
[00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:11.120]   Apple Music is now available on Sonos in beta.
[00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:13.120]   - Nice.
[00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:16.440]   - I think that's, you gotta have that.
[00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:18.600]   But I don't know how big is, I don't know how big is it.
[00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:20.000]   - My Apple TV is connected to, sorry,
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   my Sonos system is connected to my television,
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.240]   so I've just always used Apple TV to play.
[00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:25.080]   - Right.
[00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:26.800]   - Yeah, we're using it.
[00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:27.960]   - I don't know how.
[00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:31.280]   - I've been testing out the Apple Music on Sonos
[00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:32.360]   for the past couple of weeks.
[00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:33.200]   - As it said.
[00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:37.760]   - Well, I mean, that all comes through the Sonos system.
[00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:40.120]   - Right. - I know it's great.
[00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:44.760]   And the Apple Music app works just like any other service
[00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:46.720]   on Sonos.
[00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:47.560]   - Yeah.
[00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:52.560]   - You know, there's nothing really special about Apple Music
[00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:56.440]   on Sonos, but then again, you know,
[00:48:56.440 --> 00:48:59.040]   there's nothing really special about any of the services
[00:48:59.040 --> 00:48:59.880]   on Sonos. - No.
[00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:00.880]   - They don't look the same.
[00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:02.920]   - Yeah, kind of a crappy UI too.
[00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:03.760]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:06.200]   The Sonos UI is not great.
[00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:09.200]   - You know why I have high hopes?
[00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:11.680]   And it's very limited right now in services
[00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:13.320]   is the Chromecast audio,
[00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:19.240]   which I have now put everywhere and is just as added
[00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:21.760]   a Sonos like multi-room capability.
[00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:26.480]   So the secret sauce for Sonos, in my opinion,
[00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:29.560]   'cause it's really expensive,
[00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:31.520]   is you can have it play in multiple rooms
[00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:33.120]   without latency or echo.
[00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:35.320]   So there's the party mode.
[00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:38.360]   And no one has been able to duplicate that
[00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:40.560]   until now.
[00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:42.920]   And I think the Chromecast with audio is really interesting
[00:49:42.920 --> 00:49:45.760]   because it has optical out as well as analog out.
[00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:49.600]   You can, I'm putting it into my stereo system via optical.
[00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:51.240]   It's good quality.
[00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:53.920]   You control it with the phone or the tablet,
[00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:56.400]   which means that you have a nice UI.
[00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:58.760]   You know, Spotify works with it
[00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:01.040]   and I'm using the Spotify app.
[00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:03.600]   So I have the Spotify UI,
[00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:07.760]   which is far superior to the Sonos Spotify experience.
[00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:10.480]   So I'm hopeful, and by the way, much less expensive
[00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:11.720]   and you can choose your speakers
[00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:13.640]   is basically for 25 or 30 bucks,
[00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:17.800]   you're adding internet audio to any speaker system you want.
[00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:21.760]   So if you have good speakers, this is a good way to go.
[00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:23.120]   The problem is it's very late.
[00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:25.880]   It's Pandora, Spotify,
[00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:28.240]   and then some weird things like iHeartRadio and stuff.
[00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:30.040]   It's a very limited set.
[00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:31.520]   But remember Chromecast when it came out,
[00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:36.080]   it had a very few players and is more and more all the time.
[00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:38.240]   So I have high hopes for Chromecast audio.
[00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:40.680]   - Yeah, I mean, it's nice to give people
[00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:42.240]   sort of a gentle buy-in.
[00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:45.800]   Sonos is certainly the best wireless home system.
[00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:47.920]   I also love the fact that you can start small
[00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:51.600]   and then grow it out as you, over the course of several years.
[00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:54.000]   The problem is though, the buy-in is still gonna be
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:56.640]   a minimum of $200 for a single speaker
[00:50:56.640 --> 00:50:58.600]   that requires a wired connection,
[00:50:58.600 --> 00:51:01.280]   I think still to a network.
[00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:02.920]   It really only starts to really open up
[00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:05.240]   once you buy the box that lets you create
[00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:06.880]   a Sonos wireless network.
[00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:07.720]   So it's good that some people--
[00:51:07.720 --> 00:51:09.920]   - No, you can do it regularly.
[00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:12.240]   - When do they start doing that?
[00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:14.080]   - I don't know.
[00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:15.040]   - Was that to start?
[00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:18.160]   - I don't have the special Sonos box,
[00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:21.240]   but no, it's wireless.
[00:51:21.240 --> 00:51:23.040]   - Some of the components can do it too.
[00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:24.400]   Like you can plug right into the sound bar
[00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:25.920]   and that'll emulate what the box does.
[00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:27.240]   - Yeah, you don't need any point,
[00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:30.320]   your Sonos connect or because any of the speakers
[00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:32.520]   can be connected to your router
[00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:36.200]   and become the base station for Sonos.
[00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:38.800]   So you don't have to buy the Sonos connect to get on.
[00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:40.560]   - They do have a booster.
[00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:41.640]   - I'll have to check in.
[00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:45.720]   I remember setting up one Sonos device that needed old days.
[00:51:45.720 --> 00:51:48.200]   - No, I think it was one of the modern niche devices.
[00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:51.040]   It wasn't the old like VCR cabinet.
[00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:52.360]   Maybe the smallest speaker.
[00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:53.960]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:55.600]   I'll have to double check on that.
[00:51:55.600 --> 00:51:58.160]   But the smallest speaker still costs about 200 bucks
[00:51:58.160 --> 00:51:58.960]   to get in.
[00:51:58.960 --> 00:52:02.680]   So it's cool that people can buy this $30 little device
[00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:05.640]   and hook it up to a very decent pair of speakers
[00:52:05.640 --> 00:52:08.520]   that's probably already in their closet somewhere
[00:52:08.520 --> 00:52:11.320]   doing nothing and at least get a taste for what is nice,
[00:52:11.320 --> 00:52:13.360]   the nice CD of being able to walk into any room
[00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:15.960]   and just be able to connect effortlessly to audio
[00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:17.880]   without having to deal with Bluetooth.
[00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:20.840]   - It's really, if you use the services that it supports,
[00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:24.160]   which is Pandora, Google Play Music also,
[00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:29.000]   iHeartRadio, NPR One, Rhapsody,
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:33.080]   TuneIn Radio and Spotify.
[00:52:33.080 --> 00:52:37.320]   Those services, if those are like the music services you use,
[00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:38.240]   this is great.
[00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:40.960]   I use it all the time and it's not Bluetooth.
[00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:44.840]   You control it from the phone, but the Wi-Fi,
[00:52:44.840 --> 00:52:48.560]   it's Wi-Fi and the Wi-Fi is coming into the Chromecast.
[00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:51.200]   And because it has optical out, you don't have to use it.
[00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:52.400]   It's DAC.
[00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:54.680]   If you have a good DAC in your stereo
[00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:56.640]   and you probably have a better DAC in your stereo
[00:52:56.640 --> 00:52:58.800]   than the Chromecast would have,
[00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:00.960]   you can, it can sound really, really good.
[00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:01.800]   It's, it's.
[00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:03.760]   - It makes me wish there was a little AirPlay stick
[00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:05.560]   that Apple doesn't exemplar with an AirPlay stick.
[00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:06.400]   - I think so.
[00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:08.600]   - You can buy the AirPlay Express, right, to do that.
[00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:09.440]   - Yeah.
[00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:11.960]   - And use its DAC because there's only analog out.
[00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:14.560]   Or no, is there digital out of the Express?
[00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:16.040]   - I think there's still is. - I think here is, yeah.
[00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:16.880]   Okay.
[00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:21.840]   Anyway, I, yeah, I become more and more a fan of Chromecast audio.
[00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:25.680]   I've now attached one to every set of speakers in the house.
[00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:29.240]   - Yeah, I mean, I did, I had been starting to do that
[00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:33.000]   with Chromecast video after I accidentally,
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:35.120]   accidentally wound up with three of them.
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:39.400]   Because I bought a couple, when it was first announced,
[00:53:39.400 --> 00:53:44.040]   I didn't necessarily know if Google was going to be sending me one.
[00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:46.360]   I thought, okay, look, 22 bucks at start.
[00:53:46.360 --> 00:53:47.920]   It may as well order one. - Cheap, yeah.
[00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:49.440]   - And then I wanted, and then I wanted to get one.
[00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:51.240]   That was going to arrive in three days.
[00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:53.000]   And I found another source that could deliver it to me
[00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:54.240]   like the next day.
[00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:55.680]   So I could like get started on an early.
[00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:57.000]   So I wound up ordering two.
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:58.760]   And then of course, as soon as I made that second order,
[00:53:58.760 --> 00:54:00.240]   I got like the phone call from Google saying,
[00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:01.400]   "Hey, we like to send you."
[00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:02.240]   (laughing)
[00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:04.520]   - I have more Chromecast audio than I am.
[00:54:04.520 --> 00:54:05.360]   - I have inputs.
[00:54:05.360 --> 00:54:07.120]   - Exactly, it's like you.
[00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:09.040]   - Well, the great thing is I got like at least two of those
[00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:10.240]   like on the Christmas tree right now.
[00:54:10.240 --> 00:54:12.120]   You just paint like angel decorations on
[00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:13.720]   and they make really good ornaments.
[00:54:13.720 --> 00:54:16.800]   But the cool thing is like once you just, as a default,
[00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:19.080]   you have these plugged into pretty much every screen
[00:54:19.080 --> 00:54:20.480]   or every device that you have,
[00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:24.240]   you find yourself using it because it's just so easy
[00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:25.440]   to use it that way.
[00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:27.360]   Especially because I don't know the name of the technology,
[00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:29.080]   but it's a standardized TV technology.
[00:54:29.080 --> 00:54:31.960]   Where as soon as the device lights up
[00:54:31.960 --> 00:54:35.520]   with a need to serve video or audio,
[00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:37.880]   it then will, your TV will automatically switch
[00:54:37.880 --> 00:54:40.080]   to HDMI 3 if that's was plugged into.
[00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:42.520]   So you don't even have to pick up the TV remote.
[00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:45.520]   If I just start watching something on my notebook
[00:54:45.520 --> 00:54:48.640]   or on my tablet and I suddenly start to get into it enough
[00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:50.040]   that I actually want to see it on the big screen,
[00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:53.160]   use tap one button and now it's on the screen.
[00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:55.600]   So if Chromecast audio goes the exact same way,
[00:54:55.600 --> 00:54:57.120]   that's kind of the ideal.
[00:54:57.120 --> 00:55:00.560]   I love to be able to simply walk into my bathroom
[00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:02.560]   and be doing my morning ablutions
[00:55:02.560 --> 00:55:04.800]   and just be able to pick up where I was,
[00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:06.680]   the podcast where I was leaving off,
[00:55:06.680 --> 00:55:08.320]   touch a button and now it's playing through
[00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:10.560]   the speakers I've got in the shelf in my bathroom.
[00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:11.560]   - The Apple TV does that.
[00:55:11.560 --> 00:55:12.960]   It works with CEC nicely.
[00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:15.040]   So it'll grab my TV and start playing,
[00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:17.320]   which is I really like that feature.
[00:55:17.320 --> 00:55:20.160]   You don't have to get, okay, now I gotta get the A of,
[00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:22.720]   the receiver remote and press that button.
[00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:25.600]   Here's the Chromecast audio, Jason.
[00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:27.880]   And I like it also 'cause it looks like a little,
[00:55:27.880 --> 00:55:31.200]   a little freckers. - That's a nice little touch.
[00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:32.560]   It's cool, comes a little.
[00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:34.040]   - You can't even know what that is anymore.
[00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:36.040]   - I don't know, but it's cool looking, you know?
[00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:38.520]   - The weird thing is if you hold it the right way
[00:55:38.520 --> 00:55:42.000]   and you put your fingers over like those little spots,
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:43.600]   exactly like, "Hey, look, look, mom,
[00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:45.800]   "you bought me a Beats device, awesome."
[00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:48.080]   I wonder if that's accidental or in purpose.
[00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:52.640]   This is a really, so I feel like it's very innovative
[00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:54.920]   and boy, if I were Sonos, I'd be terrified
[00:55:55.960 --> 00:56:00.600]   because it's really up to the Sonos right now.
[00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:03.320]   You probably, if you're a Spotify or whoever's,
[00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:05.280]   you know, you're making it deal with Sonos
[00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:07.280]   to get on their software.
[00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:10.720]   It's, you know, there's a significant integration issue.
[00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:11.800]   You don't need to do that.
[00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:13.320]   You don't have to ask Google's permission
[00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:14.400]   to be on Chromecast audio.
[00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:16.520]   You just have to enable it on your app.
[00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:18.720]   - If you're in any business that has connected bits,
[00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:20.000]   you should be terrified of Google.
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:21.360]   - Yeah, no kidding.
[00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:25.680]   Yeah, this is a great stocking stuff.
[00:56:25.680 --> 00:56:27.920]   It's less priced 35, but as Andy pointed out,
[00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:30.280]   I think he's shopping around you and getting it for a good deal.
[00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:31.680]   Good deal less.
[00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:33.920]   I just, there's a great stocking stuffer.
[00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:37.280]   Do you use these, Jim, being a music buff as you are?
[00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:39.400]   You probably don't need one.
[00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:41.280]   Oh, Jim has disappeared.
[00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:42.120]   Stumped off.
[00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:43.920]   (laughing)
[00:56:43.920 --> 00:56:46.000]   All right, let's take a break.
[00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:49.680]   Somebody find out, Rimble, and we'll be back with more.
[00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:51.040]   I also have the battery case.
[00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:52.440]   We talked about this last week, right,
[00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:53.680]   but I have one to show.
[00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:54.520]   - Wait one.
[00:56:54.520 --> 00:56:55.400]   - I'm nice and happy.
[00:56:55.400 --> 00:56:56.240]   You got the white one?
[00:56:56.240 --> 00:56:57.240]   No, I got the black one.
[00:56:57.240 --> 00:56:59.720]   And you've written a defense of the hump.
[00:56:59.720 --> 00:57:00.560]   - Not a defense.
[00:57:00.560 --> 00:57:01.720]   I just believe if you wanna hate on it,
[00:57:01.720 --> 00:57:03.040]   you should hate on it informed.
[00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:05.120]   And I think, once you know what is doing
[00:57:05.120 --> 00:57:08.040]   and why it's doing it, at least you can hate it intelligently.
[00:57:08.040 --> 00:57:10.840]   - All right, hate on it informed in a moment.
[00:57:10.840 --> 00:57:11.680]   - Yes.
[00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:12.520]   - So, it's smart.
[00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:14.280]   Why is Leo talking about a Google product
[00:57:14.280 --> 00:57:16.040]   at an Apple show?
[00:57:16.040 --> 00:57:17.920]   'Cause we don't live in a vacuum, children.
[00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:19.080]   - It's also compatible with your Apple show.
[00:57:19.080 --> 00:57:20.400]   - It works with your iPhone.
[00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:21.240]   - Yeah.
[00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:22.400]   - It works with anything, yeah.
[00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:24.440]   That's what I really like about it.
[00:57:24.440 --> 00:57:26.040]   Our show today brought to you by Texture.
[00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:27.200]   I like magazines too.
[00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:28.880]   Can I talk about magazines?
[00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:31.880]   How about if you can read those magazines
[00:57:31.880 --> 00:57:35.120]   on your iPhone or iPad or tablet?
[00:57:35.120 --> 00:57:36.120]   It's Texture.
[00:57:36.120 --> 00:57:38.680]   I want you to go get the Texture app right now,
[00:57:38.680 --> 00:57:41.880]   download it, and then go to texture.com/macbreak
[00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:45.960]   and sign up for 30 days free.
[00:57:45.960 --> 00:57:49.400]   I, you know, we don't think of magazines much
[00:57:49.400 --> 00:57:50.440]   'cause everything's on the internet,
[00:57:50.440 --> 00:57:54.400]   but I love the idea that I can go to my Texture app
[00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:57.880]   'cause most of, even great, great magazines,
[00:57:57.880 --> 00:58:01.880]   like, well, you see The New Yorker and People and Us,
[00:58:01.880 --> 00:58:04.760]   you don't read cover to cover consumer reports.
[00:58:04.760 --> 00:58:07.240]   You know, almost every magazine has one article
[00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:09.360]   I wanna read, but I don't wanna go buy the magazine
[00:58:09.360 --> 00:58:11.160]   or subscribe to it for that one article,
[00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:14.760]   that one recipe, that one tip, Architecture.
[00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:17.880]   I love, see, for instance, I love architectural digest.
[00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:20.600]   I love reading about houses.
[00:58:20.600 --> 00:58:23.600]   They have dwell as well.
[00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:25.560]   But I'm probably not gonna buy those magazines
[00:58:25.560 --> 00:58:26.680]   just 'cause of the clutter.
[00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:29.000]   I don't want all the magazines on the other house.
[00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:30.120]   This is great.
[00:58:30.120 --> 00:58:32.680]   You can dip into a magazine.
[00:58:32.680 --> 00:58:35.280]   And boy, if you're doing a flight or anything where,
[00:58:35.280 --> 00:58:36.680]   you know, go to the doctor's office,
[00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:38.680]   don't read their old highlights for children.
[00:58:38.680 --> 00:58:40.680]   Have your own magazines.
[00:58:40.680 --> 00:58:42.800]   Exactly the magazines you want.
[00:58:42.800 --> 00:58:46.040]   All the latest issues, not only back issues
[00:58:46.040 --> 00:58:49.160]   but the one on Newstands right now.
[00:58:49.160 --> 00:58:50.240]   I love it.
[00:58:50.240 --> 00:58:52.320]   Look at the list of magazines.
[00:58:52.320 --> 00:58:55.000]   Kids magazines too, yes, absolutely.
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:58.400]   Magazines for food, for sports, pretty much everything.
[00:58:58.400 --> 00:59:00.280]   So here's the deal.
[00:59:00.280 --> 00:59:04.680]   They have curated content so you don't have to browse
[00:59:04.680 --> 00:59:05.520]   through them, but you can.
[00:59:05.520 --> 00:59:08.080]   These are magazines that are identical to the magazine
[00:59:08.080 --> 00:59:10.200]   you would read page to page, but they have
[00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:11.160]   additional bonus features.
[00:59:11.160 --> 00:59:12.920]   There's video and other stuff.
[00:59:12.920 --> 00:59:15.360]   They have a curated collections that will allow you
[00:59:15.360 --> 00:59:17.440]   to dive deeper into articles from magazines
[00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:20.200]   like the biggest, you know, fortune and fast company
[00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:23.960]   news, we can rolling stone, wired and a whole lot more.
[00:59:23.960 --> 00:59:28.920]   And you can, with the automatic download feature,
[00:59:28.920 --> 00:59:30.760]   have instant access to all your magazines,
[00:59:30.760 --> 00:59:33.000]   even when you're in the air, when you're offline.
[00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:36.880]   Therefore, for you Canadians, McLean's.
[00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:39.880]   There's one Canadian man.
[00:59:39.880 --> 00:59:42.520]   No, he's a player.
[00:59:42.520 --> 00:59:47.000]   Marie Claire, and Maxum is very continental.
[00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:48.640]   Oh my goodness.
[00:59:48.640 --> 00:59:52.280]   Textured.com/macup, Macbreak.
[00:59:52.280 --> 00:59:53.280]   Go there right now.

[00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:56.760]   Oh, by the way, this is a great gift too.
[00:59:56.760 --> 00:59:59.880]   We had, for years, we got National Geographic.
[00:59:59.880 --> 01:00:02.000]   Every year, a grandparent, that was his, you know,
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.360]   standard gift to the kids.
[01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:06.560]   Wouldn't it be cool for not much more to give them,
[01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:10.240]   not just National Geographic, but dozens of other magazines too,
[01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:11.400]   at your fingertips?
[01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:14.840]   That's a texture, a great gift idea that they'll be opening,
[01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:17.960]   a gift they'll be opening from you every day.
[01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:23.800]   Textured.com/macbreak.
[01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:26.040]   30 days free.
[01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:27.600]   Thank you, texture for that.
[01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:29.600]   You may remember we were doing ads for next issue.
[01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:31.320]   That's the rebranded.
[01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:32.760]   Same thing, next issue.
[01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:35.840]   Let's see.
[01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:39.600]   What else should we talk about?
[01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:42.920]   Oh yeah, we were gonna, I was gonna ask you
[01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:47.240]   your explanation for the hump, the bump, the hump,
[01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:48.080]   the bump, the bump.
[01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:48.920]   This thing?
[01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:50.400]   Yeah, that thing.
[01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:52.800]   So I bought this for Henry, 'cause he, I don't,
[01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:55.760]   everybody I know has a six plus or six S plus
[01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:59.360]   because we want the battery life, but the six is so woeful.
[01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:02.520]   This is a good, now why the hump?
[01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:04.720]   So there's a couple, first of all,
[01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:06.360]   this is what it looks like compared to a mophie,
[01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:07.600]   just so you can see what the mophie has.
[01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:09.720]   Yeah, the mophie has the hump, they just surround it
[01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:10.560]   with extra jump.
[01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:11.520]   They just tapered, yeah.
[01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:15.200]   So it's interesting, 'cause all design is about compromise,
[01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:17.720]   and you've got to compromise on, for example,
[01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:19.720]   on the mophie, it's got all this extra stuff on it
[01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:21.720]   to make it smooth, but it means it can't do
[01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:23.080]   certain things functionality wise.
[01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:24.880]   So for example, with the Apple case,
[01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:26.400]   because there's no battery in this area,
[01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:28.160]   I can just peel this whole thing up.
[01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:29.920]   It's a one piece design, I don't have to remove it,
[01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:31.680]   I don't have to take it off, I don't have to do that.
[01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:33.040]   I put it back on.
[01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:35.360]   Also, it doesn't cover, if you notice on the back
[01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:37.640]   of the iPhone, there are these antenna lines
[01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:39.560]   that show you where the antenna is,
[01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:41.120]   and it does not put battery over that.
[01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:43.160]   And battery, as well as providing power,
[01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:44.400]   is also a thermal insulator,
[01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:46.560]   and is also not radio transparent.
[01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:49.600]   So the nice thing about having no cover there
[01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:50.960]   is it doesn't interfere as much,
[01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:53.760]   and also Apple used that area to put in
[01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:56.720]   a couple passive antennas.
[01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:58.400]   So it tries to route the signal,
[01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:00.120]   so not only doesn't lose signal,
[01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:02.080]   but it tries to make the signal as good as possible
[01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:03.040]   when you're using it.
[01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:04.040]   And that's really important,
[01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:06.400]   because in a lot of these cases, you drop signal.
[01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:07.760]   You can actually see the bars go down,
[01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:09.440]   and you put them on, and that means the radio
[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:11.720]   has to amp up power to maintain that signal,
[01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:13.160]   and then while you are powering it,
[01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:15.680]   you're also losing more power than normal at the same time.
[01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:17.800]   And that means Apple can get away with a smaller battery.
[01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:18.640]   One of the complaints is,
[01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:20.240]   "Oh, Apple's providing a much smaller battery,"
[01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:21.240]   which is true,
[01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:24.240]   but they're also losing less power when you put it on.
[01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:26.120]   The other thing they're doing is,
[01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:27.640]   because Apple owns the whole widget,
[01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:29.200]   they own complete integration,
[01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:31.440]   your iPhone actually knows that it's in this case,
[01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:32.840]   and not connected to an outlet,
[01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:34.480]   which isn't true with other cases.
[01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:37.280]   Other cases, it just knows it's charging or not.
[01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:38.480]   And when an iPhone is charging,
[01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:39.680]   it starts to do a lot of things,
[01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:42.440]   like it runs backups, it starts opening up the networks,
[01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:44.200]   you can do many more connections,
[01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:46.520]   it basically removes a lot of the restrictions
[01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:48.120]   that iOS normally runs under.
[01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:49.680]   But with this case, it keeps those in place,
[01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:52.200]   so it won't do all the background tasks,
[01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:53.280]   it won't do all the updates,
[01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:55.560]   it won't start downloading a lot of apps,
[01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:57.720]   it'll do everything it can to maintain battery life.
[01:02:57.720 --> 01:02:59.240]   So again, you get a smaller battery,
[01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:01.920]   but you also get better battery life from it.
[01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:03.840]   And all of these things require,
[01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:04.840]   not necessarily require the hump,
[01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:07.000]   but you get them as a benefit of having the hump.
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.240]   And my thing is that,
[01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:10.400]   when people see this, like,
[01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:11.760]   "Oh, Apple has lost its design,
[01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:13.760]   "Apple no longer knows what good design is."
[01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:15.080]   But I think the proper way of looking at it
[01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:18.880]   is that Apple is historically a pretty good design company.
[01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:20.640]   And if they're willing to make these concessions,
[01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:22.880]   it might be important functionality-wise,
[01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:25.160]   people complain Apple's always form over function,
[01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:27.280]   and then when they do something functional over form,
[01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:29.960]   we hate it, which kind of gives a bit of a mixed message,
[01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:31.560]   which is very human.
[01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:33.440]   But so they make all these,
[01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:36.080]   the end result is that you have a very slim,
[01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:38.360]   very portable battery case that provides as much
[01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:40.160]   if power efficiency is possible,
[01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:41.960]   in a smaller package as possible.
[01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:43.800]   It's just not that great looking.
[01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:45.840]   In fact, you can absolutely call it ugly.
[01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:47.560]   So you choose, "I want something nice to looking
[01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:49.960]   "that has these other drawbacks, or I want this."
[01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:51.560]   But it doesn't look that great.
[01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:53.440]   You can make an informed decision, you might still hate it,
[01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:54.400]   but there are reasons.
[01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:55.240]   It's not just, "Oh, we're gonna make
[01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:57.440]   "the ugliest battery case possible ever."
[01:03:57.440 --> 01:03:58.720]   - Thank you, Renee.
[01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:00.320]   I think that's well put.
[01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:01.640]   - Uh-oh, Jim, Jim,
[01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:03.720]   I hear kind of faintly in the background.
[01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:04.820]   Is that us or Jim?
[01:04:04.820 --> 01:04:07.920]   Speak again, Jim.
[01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:08.920]   - Speak again?
[01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:09.760]   - Yeah, there you go.
[01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:14.760]   - Okay, so I don't necessarily think that it's ugly at all.
[01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:20.040]   And people have been emailing me like crazy
[01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:21.200]   over the past couple of days
[01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:23.440]   since I posted my thing about it.
[01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:28.440]   But to me, a battery case is by definition,
[01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:30.240]   a functional thing.
[01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:33.320]   You have it specifically for a battery.
[01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:38.320]   So you put it on and you get a little bit of a problem.
[01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:42.760]   You get a longer battery charge.
[01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:44.720]   I don't think that something like that
[01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:45.840]   has to be beautiful.
[01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:48.600]   I don't think Apple, you know,
[01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:52.720]   completely abandoned design over functionality on this.
[01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:57.040]   In fact, if you put the phone flat on a table,
[01:04:57.040 --> 01:05:00.360]   it actually works better with the Apple case,
[01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:02.400]   you know, being able to touch the screen and everything
[01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:04.680]   than it does with a lot of the other cases.
[01:05:04.680 --> 01:05:08.120]   So there are some, a lot of functional things
[01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:12.400]   and Renee ran through a lot of them.
[01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:17.400]   And I just think if I'm running out of battery
[01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:19.920]   and I need a case to put on there
[01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:21.880]   and Apple's case offers, you know,
[01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:25.200]   25 hours of battery life,
[01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:26.600]   I'm gonna put it on.
[01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:28.080]   I don't care, you know,
[01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:31.800]   it can have bones and trees sticking out of it.
[01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:32.960]   It doesn't matter.
[01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:36.680]   Give me 25 hours of battery life and I'm great.
[01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:40.680]   And, you know, when you look at what Apple put together for this,
[01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:42.920]   I don't necessarily think it's as bad
[01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:44.480]   as what everybody is saying.
[01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:50.040]   - Well, I got one for my son, so I'm a believer.
[01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:51.040]   - I got one for me.
[01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:51.960]   - Yeah.
[01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:54.480]   - If I had a six, I might, yeah.
[01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:56.160]   - I mean, the thing is-- - I was saying,
[01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:58.120]   on top of all the other technical things
[01:05:58.120 --> 01:06:01.160]   he was talking about, remember that because it tries
[01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:04.200]   to not add more bulk from the standard silicone fitted case
[01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:06.160]   that Apple makes, it means that any stand
[01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:08.080]   or any charger that is designed to accommodate
[01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:10.240]   that old case will still help that just as well.
[01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:12.280]   So you don't have to throw out old stuff.
[01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:14.520]   My personal preference is,
[01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:18.040]   if when I know I'm gonna be out for long enough
[01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:19.520]   that that's gonna be a factor,
[01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:21.600]   I'm the guy who would much rather just have
[01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:24.560]   a battery extender in my pocket because
[01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:27.920]   I don't like any bulk on that phone whatsoever.
[01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:29.680]   I like to just have it in my shirt pocket
[01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:32.000]   and easy to take out and easy to put back in.
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:33.400]   And the other cool thing is that
[01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:35.720]   when you have a battery extender is that oftentimes
[01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:39.200]   this is not the only USB power device that you have.
[01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:40.000]   It's not just your phone,
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.960]   you might also have a tablet or some other stuff.
[01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:44.320]   And it's really cool to have like a source of power
[01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:45.880]   that could charge or power everything.
[01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:49.160]   Sometimes even in my bag, I'll have an actual LED lamp
[01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:51.800]   that plugs directly into a USB port
[01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:53.760]   and it becomes not just a flashlight,
[01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:56.680]   but it becomes like a work light or a task light.
[01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:58.600]   So that's just my own preference.
[01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:00.960]   - I have the Mophie Power Station Duo
[01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:03.360]   that has those two giant USB plugs on.
[01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:04.200]   And that's my t-shirt.
[01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:08.280]   I got the one from Anker that's 20,000 milliamp hours
[01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:11.080]   that can fully recharge an iPad Pro
[01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:12.360]   and plus have enough left over
[01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:14.000]   for three recharges of a phone.
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:15.520]   (laughing)
[01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:19.240]   That's one of the reasons why I like the iPad Pro
[01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:21.480]   because it's just so cool to like,
[01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:23.480]   I'm gone for two days and for two days,
[01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:25.920]   I don't have to ever fight anybody
[01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:28.000]   for a seat anywhere near a power plug
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.600]   'cause I've got enough electrons
[01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:31.920]   to see me through for two whole days.
[01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:32.760]   - And the other question was,
[01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:34.080]   why didn't Apple just make the battery
[01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:35.440]   and the iPhone 6S plus,
[01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:36.880]   sorry, the 6S bigger to begin with?
[01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:38.080]   And they did that with the 6 Plus.
[01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:40.520]   So the 6 Plus is their long battery phone.
[01:07:40.520 --> 01:07:41.600]   And when you look at this,
[01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:43.000]   you can tell like this is something
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:44.760]   that is bigger and lasts much longer,
[01:07:44.760 --> 01:07:46.480]   but if you don't need it, you can also just pull it off.
[01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:48.000]   And if they built that into the phone,
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:49.760]   you wouldn't be able to pull it off when you didn't need it.
[01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:51.720]   Most people don't need that sort of battery all the time.
[01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:52.560]   - Right.
[01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:57.040]   And people have said that this is an admission by Apple
[01:07:57.040 --> 01:08:01.320]   that the battery isn't sufficient on the iPhone 6.
[01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:02.760]   I don't believe that.
[01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:05.080]   I believe that this is an admission by Apple
[01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:07.400]   that people are buying battery cases.
[01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:08.240]   - That's it.
[01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:09.840]   And it's a business, yeah.
[01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:13.320]   - Yeah, I mean, when I'm home,
[01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:16.320]   I don't run out of battery.
[01:08:16.320 --> 01:08:20.840]   It's only when I'm away and mostly away
[01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:23.560]   and at a conference where I'm gone all day
[01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:25.440]   and then at night, you have dinners
[01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:28.080]   and you have drinks and you have all this stuff
[01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:29.280]   that you have to go to,
[01:08:29.280 --> 01:08:32.520]   that's usually the time that I'll run out of battery
[01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:34.560]   and it's usually only towards the end of the night.
[01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:36.960]   So if I have a case like this
[01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:41.960]   that I can just strap on and away you go,
[01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:43.600]   I'll be good.
[01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:46.160]   - Yeah, I asked a bunch of normal people
[01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:49.320]   and like my best friend has an iPhone 6S
[01:08:49.320 --> 01:08:50.480]   and he gets down to about,
[01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:52.920]   used to get down to about 50% at the end of the day,
[01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:55.080]   but now he's streaming music on his way to,
[01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:57.360]   during his commute and he's down to 30% at the end of the night.
[01:08:57.360 --> 01:08:59.720]   And that's like from 7 a.m. to midnight.
[01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:03.160]   And he just uses it to keep track of text messages,
[01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:06.000]   check maps every once in a while and it's fine for him.
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:06.840]   - Yeah, it depends.
[01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:08.800]   You definitely don't want to get caught on the wares.
[01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:13.800]   I actually had to use my iPhone 6 Plus
[01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:16.800]   as a battery extender yesterday
[01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:19.040]   because I was using my Android phone
[01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:22.520]   as a Wi-Fi hotspot for like hours and hours and hours
[01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:23.600]   and that really did.
[01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:25.720]   It didn't destroy the battery, but I had,
[01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:27.880]   I was down to 20% and I still had to do
[01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:30.240]   like an hour long phone briefing with somebody.
[01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:32.080]   And so just fortunately,
[01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:34.640]   I always have like a SIM extraction tool
[01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:36.280]   in my wallet at all times.
[01:09:36.280 --> 01:09:38.280]   So I had to go into the library
[01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:41.520]   and just swap the SIMs and these two phones,
[01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:45.040]   or rather take the SIM out of my Android phone
[01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:47.840]   with 20% battery, put it into the empty SIM slot
[01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:51.280]   of the iPhone that had about an 82 or 88% battery
[01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:52.800]   that I was just using as a camera,
[01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:55.080]   just to make sure that I could like have this
[01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:57.720]   hour long phone briefing for switching back again.
[01:09:57.720 --> 01:10:00.000]   So you don't want to be caught on a wares like that.
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:01.680]   - Yeah, my whole thing is tell people the cases,
[01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:03.240]   luckily all you want, but also inform them
[01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:04.080]   on all the benefits.
[01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:06.000]   That way they can make an educated buying decision.
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:07.640]   Cause it's really not about us in the tech press going,
[01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:08.800]   "Oh, I'm going to go get Apple.
[01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:10.200]   I'm going to tell them that their design sucks."
[01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:11.040]   Ha ha ha.
[01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:12.880]   It's about helping all our readers or all our viewers
[01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:14.640]   or all our listeners make better choices.
[01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:16.760]   And you got to give them information to do that.
[01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:17.600]   - Yeah, I agree.
[01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:19.280]   - Did that information come out through briefings
[01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:21.360]   or through their own public statements?
[01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:23.360]   - I, I, I, I went and sought it out.
[01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:24.200]   I talked to a bunch of it.
[01:10:24.200 --> 01:10:26.800]   I did a whole thing on, on battery life earlier in the year.
[01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:29.120]   And then I started looking at why it was designed this way.
[01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:30.720]   And one of the things I try to do is figure out
[01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:31.560]   what's the alternative.
[01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:33.760]   So if, if you do B instead of A, what is the benefit
[01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:35.080]   and what is the cost?
[01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:36.320]   And then once I whittle that down,
[01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:37.880]   I start fact checking it with people.
[01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:39.040]   But there's always a consequence.
[01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:40.560]   Everyone thinks, well, they could just do this.
[01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:42.480]   It's like in programming, just flip the bit.
[01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:43.320]   Just flip the bit.
[01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:44.240]   Everything will be great.
[01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:47.200]   But atoms are even harder to work with than bits.
[01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:49.520]   - At the same time, it is part of Apple's responsibility.
[01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:51.400]   I don't think that Apple did a design failure
[01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:54.040]   in designing it with that, that putting a design
[01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:55.680]   that people would think was unattractive.
[01:10:55.680 --> 01:10:58.200]   I think their only real failure was not communicating.
[01:10:58.200 --> 01:10:59.800]   Here's why we made the choices we did.
[01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:02.600]   Here is the, we know that we know that numerically
[01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:05.400]   other competing battery packs are less expensive.
[01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:09.880]   And the actual battery inside has, has a greater capacity
[01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:11.000]   than what we're selling you.
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.400]   But here's why we're telling you that this is a good design
[01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:15.120]   and why you might want to consider this
[01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:16.720]   as an alternative to a Mophie.
[01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:18.520]   - You needed a Shiller keynote.
[01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:20.240]   - Yeah. (laughs)
[01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:21.280]   - Well, I'm just grateful to them
[01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:24.880]   'cause we've got an hour-seater content out of this battery case.
[01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:27.960]   - We want to fit a Rege touch for this one.
[01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:30.000]   - But in the absent that, I feel like it's my job.
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:31.200]   They should absolutely tell us.
[01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:32.680]   And we complain about that with other companies.
[01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:34.720]   Like when they don't tell you what the talking points are,
[01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:36.840]   it's we end up inventing them 'cause we just don't know.
[01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:38.320]   And it's in their best interest to tell us
[01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:39.840]   'cause then we stay as close to the,
[01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:40.800]   if their message makes sense,
[01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:42.440]   they get their message out there.
[01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:44.520]   So absent that though, I feel like we've got to start
[01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:45.280]   hunting this stuff down.
[01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:47.960]   - That's always been our responsibility.
[01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:50.680]   But the problem is that it takes us two or three days
[01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:54.000]   to get emails returned, to find the right person to talk to.
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.480]   Meanwhile, people are just looking at this thing
[01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:59.120]   and making a snap judgment based on what they're seeing.
[01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:03.320]   So I mean, it is our, the first thing that you do is,
[01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:05.160]   when you're taking notes,
[01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:06.640]   you're gonna be thinking like that is okay,
[01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:09.680]   talking point one, talking point three, talking point four,
[01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:14.280]   drink, but it's, you're trying to do the best job you can
[01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:17.520]   for the purpose of the customers and the users
[01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:18.600]   and the real people out there.
[01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:22.760]   It's just, it's just bad that sometimes it feels like,
[01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:24.160]   not, this is not just for a Apple,
[01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:26.920]   sometimes it feels like we have to carry water
[01:12:26.920 --> 01:12:29.720]   for these companies and explain, okay,
[01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:33.240]   you think that this design and this Android phone is stupid,
[01:12:33.240 --> 01:12:35.400]   but let me show you what, let me explain to you why
[01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:37.960]   there is this bump with that camera lens goes.
[01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:39.280]   I know that you think it's ugly,
[01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:41.680]   but here is what Nokia was able to do
[01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:43.880]   by putting that ugly bump in there.
[01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:47.000]   And you wish that you were just simply quoting something
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.120]   that someone official had said.
[01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:53.000]   You don't wanna be in the job of doing a company's PR for them.
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.560]   And sometimes when you're just trying to be fair
[01:12:55.560 --> 01:12:58.880]   and trying to present your readers with the most accurate
[01:12:58.880 --> 01:13:01.440]   and complete rundown of what this thing is,
[01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:04.440]   you feel like you're saying, okay, I know,
[01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:06.120]   a hundred people are saying this is ugly,
[01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:08.480]   now I'm gonna tell you why it's a beautiful design
[01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:10.120]   and why it's not stupid.
[01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:12.600]   And like you're committed to truth, beauty and wisdom
[01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:13.880]   at all times, but it's like,
[01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:17.680]   if they send me a fruit bouquet,
[01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:19.160]   the company sends me a fruit bouquet saying,
[01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:21.560]   well, thank you very much for doing our work for us.
[01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:24.400]   I'm gonna have to change jobs because I feel dirty.
[01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:27.760]   - There was a great post by Alex Lindsey on Facebook.
[01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:29.720]   A publication put up this article saying,
[01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:31.880]   "Even Apple doesn't wanna use Final Cut Pro anymore."
[01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:32.720]   - Oh yeah.
[01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:35.520]   - Because there was a job listing for a position
[01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:38.840]   in Culver City at the Beats office using Adobe or Avid.
[01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:40.080]   And they said, "This is proof positive
[01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:41.080]   that Apple's not using it."
[01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:42.840]   And Alex went on Facebook and he goes,
[01:13:42.840 --> 01:13:45.040]   "If you'd spent two minutes thinking about it
[01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:46.440]   or asking anyone of us in the industry
[01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:48.880]   would have told you that this is an acquired company
[01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:50.800]   with an existing pipeline.
[01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:52.680]   It takes a really long time to change that
[01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:54.120]   and it'd be worse if you tried to impose
[01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:55.320]   your own homegrown software on it."
[01:13:55.320 --> 01:13:57.680]   So, and then he walked you through it XYZ,
[01:13:57.680 --> 01:14:00.760]   but it doesn't always like just reach out to these people.
[01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:02.760]   They're there, they will help you with these stories.
[01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:05.400]   - Incidentally unbox their unboxing therapy.
[01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:09.360]   Does it tear down of the iPhone 6S smart battery case?
[01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:11.080]   And as you can see in this close up,
[01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:15.680]   we now know it is 1,877 milliamp hours.
[01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:17.240]   - Bigger than the iPhone batteries.
[01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:19.240]   - That is bigger than the iPhone 6 battery?
[01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:20.080]   - Yeah.
[01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:21.640]   - So it's more than double?
[01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:23.440]   - Yeah, although you don't get that puddle minute.
[01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:24.840]   - Yeah, there's overhead.
[01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:28.560]   But I think what that says is Apple was conservative
[01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:30.200]   and it's estimated, 'cause they didn't even say
[01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:31.760]   you could double the battery life.
[01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:32.920]   They said almost.
[01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:37.160]   - It charges my iPhone about 80%, like 70, 80, 79, 80%
[01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:38.000]   when I put it on at zero.
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.040]   - Oh, that's accurate then.
[01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:41.720]   Let's see what else.
[01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:46.000]   Oh, if you think winning a Tony is a good thing,
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.840]   you know what, you'd really wanna get the best of 2015
[01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:50.040]   in the iTunes store.
[01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:52.880]   I bet you sells more records than a Tony award.
[01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:56.080]   According to Apple, the best artist, Drake, best album,
[01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:58.840]   Kendrick Lamar's "To Pimp a Butterfly."
[01:14:58.840 --> 01:15:02.400]   Best song, "I Can't Feel My Face" by the weekend.
[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:05.120]   Best new artist, Bryson Tiller, we were mentioned
[01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:08.960]   as one of the best podcasts of 2015.
[01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:12.520]   - Thank you, Twit was the Twit podcast,
[01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:16.000]   not Mac Break Weekly, I'm sorry to say, but thank you Apple.
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:17.880]   - I think they meant to say Mac Break Weekly.
[01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:19.720]   - It was a special guest.
[01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:22.440]   - It was a minor overshack, that's all it was.
[01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:23.320]   - They couldn't give it to two,
[01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:24.840]   they wanted to give it to both, but it would be on some.
[01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:26.520]   - I'm sure that that's the case.
[01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:28.040]   I'm sure that that's the case.
[01:15:28.040 --> 01:15:31.000]   In the best of 2015 podcasts, we are featured
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:34.520]   in the classics, the best classic podcast was not Twit,
[01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:36.400]   but in fact, WTF by Mark Merritt.
[01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:37.880]   Hey, getting a president, an interview
[01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:39.360]   that was sitting present in the United States,
[01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:40.560]   probably helped.
[01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:44.640]   Best new podcast was "Gimlet's Mystery Show,"
[01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:47.320]   which I'm not familiar with, and you don't see us
[01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:50.120]   right in the front there, but if you drill down
[01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:52.400]   a little bit into classics, I think,
[01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:53.920]   yeah, there it is, Twit is there.
[01:15:53.920 --> 01:15:56.480]   Right in between "On Point with Tom Ashbrook"
[01:15:56.480 --> 01:15:59.880]   and "Risk, True Tales, Boldly Told."
[01:15:59.880 --> 01:16:04.040]   Discovery is really a big deal, not just for podcasts,
[01:16:04.040 --> 01:16:05.740]   but for everybody in the iTunes store
[01:16:05.740 --> 01:16:09.940]   that wields immense power when it comes to music sales.
[01:16:09.940 --> 01:16:10.980]   So-- - It apps up as well.
[01:16:10.980 --> 01:16:12.260]   There's a lot of really good stuff this year.
[01:16:12.260 --> 01:16:13.780]   - I bet you if you asked Kendrick Lamar,
[01:16:13.780 --> 01:16:16.940]   would you rather win a Tony Grammy
[01:16:16.940 --> 01:16:20.500]   or be the best of 2015 on iTunes?
[01:16:20.500 --> 01:16:21.580]   I think it'd be pretty clear that--
[01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:23.340]   - Grammy has no buy now button during the show.
[01:16:23.340 --> 01:16:24.740]   - There's no buy now button.
[01:16:24.740 --> 01:16:28.660]   - Stephen Sondheim is still upset that he has the E-GOT,
[01:16:28.660 --> 01:16:30.100]   but he doesn't have the B-GOT.
[01:16:30.100 --> 01:16:30.940]   - You need a B-GOT.
[01:16:30.940 --> 01:16:32.940]   - He's the final B-best of iTunes.
[01:16:33.900 --> 01:16:36.980]   Or I could maybe be a E-GOTY.
[01:16:36.980 --> 01:16:39.380]   - Oi, a GOT.
[01:16:39.380 --> 01:16:40.820]   - A GOT, I got a GOT.
[01:16:40.820 --> 01:16:42.900]   Nice.
[01:16:42.900 --> 01:16:45.180]   Let's see, Swift.
[01:16:45.180 --> 01:16:46.260]   - It was a tough job this year
[01:16:46.260 --> 01:16:49.220]   because they had Apple didn't just launch two new products,
[01:16:49.220 --> 01:16:50.300]   they launched two new app stores.
[01:16:50.300 --> 01:16:53.020]   So instead of just iPhone and iPad and Mac,
[01:16:53.020 --> 01:16:55.380]   they also had Apple Watch and Apple TV to consider this year.
[01:16:55.380 --> 01:16:58.020]   - Oh yeah, well, did they do a best of Apple TV?
[01:16:58.020 --> 01:16:59.820]   - Yeah, it's a little bit harder to find.
[01:16:59.820 --> 01:17:01.740]   Like you can find iPhone and iPad in iTunes,
[01:17:01.740 --> 01:17:03.500]   but you have to go to the Watch app on the Apple,
[01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:05.300]   on the iPhone to see the Watch apps.
[01:17:05.300 --> 01:17:06.340]   You have to go to the Apple TV,
[01:17:06.340 --> 01:17:07.980]   I think to see the Apple TV apps.
[01:17:07.980 --> 01:17:08.820]   They did all of them.
[01:17:08.820 --> 01:17:09.660]   - You see what they're doing.
[01:17:09.660 --> 01:17:11.260]   - I really like the new Apple TV.
[01:17:11.260 --> 01:17:13.020]   - I do too, I'm very happy with it.
[01:17:13.020 --> 01:17:14.260]   I am too.
[01:17:14.260 --> 01:17:18.300]   I only bought one at first, then I realized I have three TVs.
[01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:19.140]   (laughing)
[01:17:19.140 --> 01:17:19.980]   I bought two more.
[01:17:19.980 --> 01:17:20.820]   Well, we have all the Apple TVs.
[01:17:20.820 --> 01:17:22.100]   - The whole family is getting them for Christmas.
[01:17:22.100 --> 01:17:23.500]   - Yeah, basically it was good.
[01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:25.020]   So let me look at the Watch app.
[01:17:25.020 --> 01:17:26.500]   Where can I am?
[01:17:26.500 --> 01:17:28.140]   - In the Watch Store, they should have a best of,
[01:17:28.140 --> 01:17:30.740]   if you go to the button that says featured, the bottom.
[01:17:30.740 --> 01:17:31.580]   - Okay, there's a store.
[01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:32.660]   - And then there should be a banner that tells us stuff.
[01:17:32.660 --> 01:17:33.780]   - Oh yes, that stuff.
[01:17:33.780 --> 01:17:35.020]   Yes, so the same thing with the TV,
[01:17:35.020 --> 01:17:36.740]   you'd have to go to the TV.
[01:17:36.740 --> 01:17:41.420]   The best Watch app of 2015, Dark Sky, I'd agree with that.
[01:17:41.420 --> 01:17:43.420]   Best game rules, I don't know that one,
[01:17:43.420 --> 01:17:45.060]   I'll have to try that.
[01:17:45.060 --> 01:17:47.460]   Best apps, pacemaker, your personal,
[01:17:47.460 --> 01:17:49.020]   is that your personal pacemaker?
[01:17:49.020 --> 01:17:49.860]   No, it must be.
[01:17:49.860 --> 01:17:50.700]   - That's DJ, it's amazing.
[01:17:50.700 --> 01:17:51.860]   - Oh, it's good, okay.
[01:17:51.860 --> 01:17:53.100]   City mapper, I agree.
[01:17:53.100 --> 01:17:54.540]   That's really great on the Apple Watch,
[01:17:54.540 --> 01:17:58.340]   actually Pocket Yoga, Elevate, MLB.
[01:17:58.340 --> 01:18:01.420]   So if you're looking for apps to put on your watch,
[01:18:01.420 --> 01:18:02.580]   that's a great source.
[01:18:02.580 --> 01:18:04.300]   If you're looking for apps to put on your Mac,
[01:18:04.300 --> 01:18:06.300]   the app of the year is Affinity Photo,
[01:18:06.300 --> 01:18:09.940]   I don't even know that one, a $40 photography photo.
[01:18:09.940 --> 01:18:11.500]   Pillars, is it good?
[01:18:11.500 --> 01:18:12.500]   You like it?
[01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:16.300]   - Affinity is a super, super replacement for Photoshop.
[01:18:16.300 --> 01:18:17.780]   - Oh really?
[01:18:17.780 --> 01:18:20.140]   - Giving a whole bunch of really nice advanced features,
[01:18:20.140 --> 01:18:22.580]   not just layers and not just paint brushes,
[01:18:22.580 --> 01:18:24.340]   but nicely designed.
[01:18:24.340 --> 01:18:27.740]   As usual, there are a bunch of really nice apps
[01:18:27.740 --> 01:18:29.020]   that are kind of like Photoshop,
[01:18:29.020 --> 01:18:31.140]   only a couple of generations out of date.
[01:18:31.140 --> 01:18:33.740]   This one is great because Adobe,
[01:18:33.740 --> 01:18:38.060]   I don't think they'll ever do a truly macOS focused version
[01:18:38.060 --> 01:18:40.020]   of it because it always has to be multi-platform.
[01:18:40.020 --> 01:18:42.020]   This is developers who wanna make something
[01:18:42.020 --> 01:18:44.020]   that is emphatically a Mac app.
[01:18:44.020 --> 01:18:47.780]   It just oozes cocoa from every port.
[01:18:47.780 --> 01:18:51.300]   - And it's a 20% off right now
[01:18:51.300 --> 01:18:53.340]   because of their pick as app of the year.
[01:18:53.340 --> 01:18:55.980]   You don't see my screen, Jason?
[01:18:55.980 --> 01:18:58.780]   That's all right.
[01:18:58.780 --> 01:19:01.980]   It's only for people watching that video anyway.
[01:19:01.980 --> 01:19:04.580]   The other stuff, I mean, okay,
[01:19:04.580 --> 01:19:07.220]   when I say it looks like Photoshop, I mean it's dark.
[01:19:07.220 --> 01:19:09.140]   - Pro apps are darkly, are you?
[01:19:09.140 --> 01:19:11.420]   - Pro apps, you know it's a pro app 'cause it's dark
[01:19:11.420 --> 01:19:12.860]   and it has kittens.
[01:19:12.860 --> 01:19:13.780]   Oh look, it's got--
[01:19:13.780 --> 01:19:15.540]   - Big walnut and chrome and stereo equipment
[01:19:15.540 --> 01:19:16.940]   in the early 80s.
[01:19:16.940 --> 01:19:18.620]   - Yes, exactly, it all must be high.
[01:19:18.620 --> 01:19:22.060]   It looks like it's got curves and layers.
[01:19:22.060 --> 01:19:23.220]   This looks good.
[01:19:23.220 --> 01:19:24.060]   I'm not supposed to--
[01:19:24.060 --> 01:19:25.940]   - The iPhone app of the year was in a photo app too,
[01:19:25.940 --> 01:19:29.340]   and light so it's like a Renaissance period for photo apps.
[01:19:29.340 --> 01:19:31.780]   - Yeah, well, we're good to reason.
[01:19:31.780 --> 01:19:33.180]   I haven't played Pillars of Eternity,
[01:19:33.180 --> 01:19:35.580]   either game of the year either.
[01:19:35.580 --> 01:19:37.860]   Man, I got some down, I got some down.
[01:19:37.860 --> 01:19:39.500]   Oh, this looks good.
[01:19:39.500 --> 01:19:40.340]   - Yeah.
[01:19:40.340 --> 01:19:41.980]   - Got some downloading to do, is it?
[01:19:41.980 --> 01:19:43.140]   Oh, ooh, ooh.
[01:19:43.140 --> 01:19:44.660]   - Best iPhone game was Lara Croft,
[01:19:44.660 --> 01:19:45.660]   so that's making a comeback.
[01:19:45.660 --> 01:19:46.940]   - Really?
[01:19:46.940 --> 01:19:48.860]   I hear good things about the new Tomb Raider,
[01:19:48.860 --> 01:19:51.980]   so it must be piggybacking on that.
[01:19:51.980 --> 01:19:54.380]   - They're doing an origin sequence,
[01:19:54.380 --> 01:19:56.740]   starting with the Big Reboot that a couple of years ago,
[01:19:56.740 --> 01:19:57.900]   and it's just terrific.
[01:19:57.900 --> 01:20:01.140]   She's no longer the--
[01:20:01.140 --> 01:20:01.980]   - Like the--
[01:20:01.980 --> 01:20:05.260]   - Sexy, sexy Tomb Vixen.
[01:20:05.260 --> 01:20:07.220]   Now she survives a plane crash,
[01:20:07.220 --> 01:20:10.820]   and she has to battle her way through rainy stuff.
[01:20:10.820 --> 01:20:14.060]   Oddly enough, what I like about the new games is that,
[01:20:14.060 --> 01:20:16.740]   she's more of an Indiana Jones character
[01:20:16.740 --> 01:20:17.940]   where she's not invincible,
[01:20:17.940 --> 01:20:20.300]   like she falls down and she gets hurt,
[01:20:20.300 --> 01:20:23.100]   and you're like, oh, that really, really hurt.
[01:20:23.100 --> 01:20:24.860]   So you really do learn about it.
[01:20:24.860 --> 01:20:27.300]   You have respect for the character,
[01:20:27.300 --> 01:20:29.940]   as opposed to just having fun with the gameplay.
[01:20:29.940 --> 01:20:31.580]   - Yeah, this is a pillar of the journey.
[01:20:31.580 --> 01:20:33.980]   It looks a lot like Diablo.
[01:20:33.980 --> 01:20:35.620]   Three, actually.
[01:20:35.620 --> 01:20:37.660]   Have you played it, Renee?
[01:20:37.660 --> 01:20:39.140]   - When it first came out, I looked at it.
[01:20:39.140 --> 01:20:41.020]   I didn't have the luxury of playing two games,
[01:20:41.020 --> 01:20:42.580]   but I mean, it was beautiful.
[01:20:42.580 --> 01:20:44.140]   - I wanna buy it, I'll buy it.
[01:20:44.140 --> 01:20:47.700]   - The runner up on iPhone were Periscope and Rayman.
[01:20:47.700 --> 01:20:49.620]   - And I saw that, and I thought it was interesting.
[01:20:49.620 --> 01:20:51.020]   I agree with it, by the way, on Rayman.
[01:20:51.020 --> 01:20:52.460]   That's really fun, but that's a classic,
[01:20:52.460 --> 01:20:53.540]   in many ways.
[01:20:53.540 --> 01:20:55.260]   But Periscope, I thought, was interesting.
[01:20:55.260 --> 01:20:59.100]   That Apple made it pick between Miercat and Periscope.
[01:20:59.100 --> 01:21:00.780]   - Yeah, I would have gone Miercat, I think,
[01:21:00.780 --> 01:21:02.940]   because it was a little bit first.
[01:21:02.940 --> 01:21:05.460]   - Yeah, Periscope's owned by Twitter, though,
[01:21:05.460 --> 01:21:08.700]   and probably is the one with staying power, I would guess.
[01:21:08.700 --> 01:21:10.900]   - And then the robot factory was the iPad app,
[01:21:10.900 --> 01:21:13.260]   and Game of the Year for iPad was Prune,
[01:21:13.260 --> 01:21:14.100]   which we featured on the show.
[01:21:14.100 --> 01:21:15.020]   - Oh, love Prune.
[01:21:15.020 --> 01:21:16.100]   That's a fun game.
[01:21:16.100 --> 01:21:19.580]   - Here is-- - I just don't get the play games.
[01:21:19.580 --> 01:21:21.740]   - Oh, man, you gotta get a better job, man.
[01:21:21.740 --> 01:21:23.260]   - I just-- (laughing)
[01:21:23.260 --> 01:21:24.100]   - You're boss, Jim.
[01:21:24.100 --> 01:21:25.180]   You just tell your boss to shove it.
[01:21:25.180 --> 01:21:26.020]   - Tell the boss.
[01:21:26.020 --> 01:21:27.860]   - My boss is such an ass, you know.
[01:21:27.860 --> 01:21:29.500]   - Isn't it terrible when you work for yourself,
[01:21:29.500 --> 01:21:31.260]   because then when you play a game,
[01:21:31.260 --> 01:21:32.660]   you're stealing from yourself.
[01:21:32.660 --> 01:21:33.500]   - I know.
[01:21:33.500 --> 01:21:34.340]   - So that's no good.
[01:21:34.340 --> 01:21:35.740]   - I feel so guilty.
[01:21:35.740 --> 01:21:37.060]   Why don't you do it when you're so tired
[01:21:37.060 --> 01:21:38.220]   that you just wanna fall asleep,
[01:21:38.220 --> 01:21:39.300]   and the phone hits you in the head.
[01:21:39.300 --> 01:21:41.380]   - But the great thing is, like, all your friends
[01:21:41.380 --> 01:21:43.420]   and family who aren't self-employed,
[01:21:43.420 --> 01:21:46.020]   they think that you're some kind of workaholic,
[01:21:46.020 --> 01:21:49.860]   because the times when I've been asked,
[01:21:49.860 --> 01:21:52.620]   like, "Oh, I'll be visiting friends,
[01:21:52.620 --> 01:21:55.780]   "or my family, like, on the afternoon on Christmas day."
[01:21:55.780 --> 01:21:56.940]   So how do you spend the morning?
[01:21:56.940 --> 01:21:59.420]   Like, "Oh, well, I wrote for about two or three hours,
[01:21:59.420 --> 01:22:00.860]   "and then I checked my own box."
[01:22:00.860 --> 01:22:03.580]   My God, it didn't even take Christmas morning off
[01:22:03.580 --> 01:22:04.700]   for God's sakes.
[01:22:04.700 --> 01:22:06.100]   Like, well, 'cause I had nothing to do
[01:22:06.100 --> 01:22:08.340]   for two and a half hours, and I like my job.
[01:22:08.340 --> 01:22:11.820]   So why not be able to goof off on Friday
[01:22:11.820 --> 01:22:15.660]   as I wanted to do by working on Christmas morning?
[01:22:15.660 --> 01:22:18.420]   - Are you curious about the evolution of Swift?
[01:22:18.420 --> 01:22:20.900]   - Here's a really cool visualization.
[01:22:20.900 --> 01:22:25.300]   It's a video on Vimeo that starts in July 2010
[01:22:25.300 --> 01:22:29.460]   with Chris Latner creating the very first bits.
[01:22:29.460 --> 01:22:32.900]   And it looks like this is kind of a visualization
[01:22:32.900 --> 01:22:36.460]   of the commits, other people coming on the team,
[01:22:36.460 --> 01:22:38.540]   making commits to different pieces.
[01:22:38.540 --> 01:22:40.980]   You could see what they're working on.
[01:22:40.980 --> 01:22:41.820]   - Really good visualization.
[01:22:41.820 --> 01:22:43.900]   - This is really cool.
[01:22:43.900 --> 01:22:44.940]   I don't know how they do this,
[01:22:44.940 --> 01:22:46.900]   but is that your sense of this, Renee,
[01:22:46.900 --> 01:22:49.780]   is this is the commits to the CVS?
[01:22:49.780 --> 01:22:50.620]   - I mean, it's what it looked like.
[01:22:50.620 --> 01:22:52.460]   It went from one person knowing it to five people,
[01:22:52.460 --> 01:22:54.140]   knowing that the entire company company company.
[01:22:54.140 --> 01:22:54.900]   - Yeah, and you can see they're working
[01:22:54.900 --> 01:22:56.860]   on different branches of it.
[01:22:56.860 --> 01:22:58.460]   I don't know what tool they use to do this.
[01:22:58.460 --> 01:23:00.060]   If it's an automated tool, I want it,
[01:23:00.060 --> 01:23:01.940]   because I'd love to run this in a lot of different
[01:23:01.940 --> 01:23:03.780]   open source projects and so forth.
[01:23:03.780 --> 01:23:06.180]   The fun to see the evolution of Linux, for instance.
[01:23:06.180 --> 01:23:08.420]   - On this topic, John Gruber scored a 30 minute interview
[01:23:08.420 --> 01:23:10.700]   with Craig Federicki on the talk show last night.
[01:23:10.700 --> 01:23:11.540]   - Nice. - So you can listen
[01:23:11.540 --> 01:23:13.460]   to Craig talking deeper than he did
[01:23:13.460 --> 01:23:15.860]   on the text interviews.
[01:23:15.860 --> 01:23:17.580]   - Great. - It was really interesting.
[01:23:17.580 --> 01:23:19.260]   And then John Syracuse that finishes off the show
[01:23:19.260 --> 01:23:20.580]   by analyzing everything Craig said.
[01:23:20.580 --> 01:23:21.940]   (laughing)
[01:23:21.940 --> 01:23:24.220]   - Did we mention that Swift is open source now?
[01:23:24.220 --> 01:23:25.540]   In fact, there's a Linux implementation.
[01:23:25.540 --> 01:23:28.740]   Yeah, 'cause I showed the IBM workshop.
[01:23:28.740 --> 01:23:30.740]   - And apparently the mailing list
[01:23:30.740 --> 01:23:31.900]   and everything that's happening on GitHub,
[01:23:31.900 --> 01:23:33.740]   it is open source in the best sense of the word.
[01:23:33.740 --> 01:23:34.580]   - It looks like.
[01:23:34.580 --> 01:23:35.660]   - Here's the open source stuff.
[01:23:35.660 --> 01:23:37.660]   Don't go. - No, yeah, it looks like it.
[01:23:37.660 --> 01:23:39.140]   They've done the right thing.
[01:23:39.140 --> 01:23:41.020]   Good, well, I have to listen to a Gruber's interview
[01:23:41.020 --> 01:23:42.940]   with Craig Federicki.
[01:23:42.940 --> 01:23:45.220]   Meanwhile, I'm mesmerized.
[01:23:45.220 --> 01:23:46.700]   We were up to 2013 now.
[01:23:46.700 --> 01:23:48.380]   It still hasn't been announced.
[01:23:48.380 --> 01:23:50.420]   This is all still behind the scenes.
[01:23:50.420 --> 01:23:54.540]   Top secret, but more people are working on it
[01:23:54.540 --> 01:23:56.380]   and branches are expanding.
[01:23:56.380 --> 01:23:59.620]   - Anybody looking at this wanna say,
[01:23:59.620 --> 01:24:00.980]   oh, cool, this is Linux.
[01:24:00.980 --> 01:24:02.780]   I know this.
[01:24:02.780 --> 01:24:04.300]   (laughing)
[01:24:04.300 --> 01:24:05.540]   - I'm just worried about Star Wars spoilers
[01:24:05.540 --> 01:24:06.380]   as I watch this.
[01:24:06.380 --> 01:24:10.460]   - Well, it's written in, you see objective C headers,
[01:24:10.460 --> 01:24:12.780]   you see C++ headers, it looks like.
[01:24:12.780 --> 01:24:15.500]   You see, isn't that what CPP is?
[01:24:15.500 --> 01:24:17.860]   It's interesting.
[01:24:17.860 --> 01:24:22.380]   I don't know why is CPP Objective C or C++?
[01:24:22.380 --> 01:24:24.380]   I don't know what that is.
[01:24:24.380 --> 01:24:27.940]   Text, you see rest files, map files.
[01:24:27.940 --> 01:24:31.820]   There's some Python, some shell, some CSS in there.
[01:24:31.820 --> 01:24:34.460]   They're using CMake, Vim.
[01:24:34.460 --> 01:24:37.020]   This is great.
[01:24:37.020 --> 01:24:38.020]   This is fun to watch.
[01:24:38.020 --> 01:24:39.540]   (laughing)
[01:24:39.540 --> 01:24:42.060]   This is my idea of a first person shooter, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:24:42.060 --> 01:24:42.900]   (laughing)
[01:24:42.900 --> 01:24:44.300]   - Looks like that Steve Gibson video game
[01:24:44.300 --> 01:24:45.820]   for people who can't see it in there.
[01:24:45.820 --> 01:24:48.500]   - Yeah, you ever wondered how development,
[01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:52.580]   iterative development works in open source projects?
[01:24:52.580 --> 01:24:53.660]   Wow, this is really cool.
[01:24:53.660 --> 01:24:55.460]   So the little people are moving,
[01:24:55.460 --> 01:24:58.500]   sometimes they move from branch to branch,
[01:24:58.500 --> 01:25:00.700]   start working on something else.
[01:25:00.700 --> 01:25:01.540]   - Wow.
[01:25:01.540 --> 01:25:04.580]   - So, it's implemented in C++.
[01:25:04.580 --> 01:25:06.220]   Who would have thunk it?
[01:25:06.220 --> 01:25:07.420]   - It's a rebro, first person.
[01:25:07.420 --> 01:25:08.420]   - I wouldn't have thought that.
[01:25:08.420 --> 01:25:10.980]   I would have thought I would see a subjective C.
[01:25:11.980 --> 01:25:12.980]   - Huh.
[01:25:12.980 --> 01:25:14.740]   - I think the compiler team has always worked in--
[01:25:14.740 --> 01:25:15.580]   - C++?
[01:25:15.580 --> 01:25:16.740]   - Yeah, C++.
[01:25:16.740 --> 01:25:17.580]   - Interesting.
[01:25:17.580 --> 01:25:20.180]   - Hmm.
[01:25:20.180 --> 01:25:21.700]   - That makes sense, actually.
[01:25:21.700 --> 01:25:23.260]   That's kind of the power tool for--
[01:25:23.260 --> 01:25:25.820]   - Although they say that Swift is designed to write
[01:25:25.820 --> 01:25:28.060]   everything from operating systems to high level scripts,
[01:25:28.060 --> 01:25:29.980]   and maybe one day that'll change.
[01:25:29.980 --> 01:25:30.820]   - Right.
[01:25:30.820 --> 01:25:34.580]   - Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:25:34.580 --> 01:25:35.420]   (laughing)
[01:25:35.420 --> 01:25:36.260]   - It's messed up.
[01:25:36.260 --> 01:25:37.100]   - It's just a ton of kids there.
[01:25:37.100 --> 01:25:38.700]   - I can't stop watching.
[01:25:38.700 --> 01:25:40.700]   - It's fascinating.
[01:25:40.700 --> 01:25:42.820]   Okay.
[01:25:42.820 --> 01:25:44.860]   - If this were a game pick of the week,
[01:25:44.860 --> 01:25:46.740]   I would probably spend $2.99.
[01:25:46.740 --> 01:25:49.740]   - This would be such an awesome game.
[01:25:49.740 --> 01:25:50.660]   It's like a simulator.
[01:25:50.660 --> 01:25:52.020]   You got to move Latner to this node
[01:25:52.020 --> 01:25:52.860]   if you wanna make sure that this doesn't happen.
[01:25:52.860 --> 01:25:53.780]   - Oh my God.
[01:25:53.780 --> 01:25:55.900]   Oh yeah, we're losing--
[01:25:55.900 --> 01:25:57.140]   - They're gonna get rid of++
[01:25:57.140 --> 01:25:58.500]   and go straight to plus, move Chris over here.
[01:25:58.500 --> 01:25:59.980]   (laughing)
[01:25:59.980 --> 01:26:01.700]   - Oh no, you forked it.
[01:26:01.700 --> 01:26:02.980]   - Oh no, overloading.
[01:26:02.980 --> 01:26:03.820]   Move it over here.
[01:26:03.820 --> 01:26:06.300]   - And I get, if you slow it down,
[01:26:06.300 --> 01:26:07.580]   you could probably read a little bit more
[01:26:07.580 --> 01:26:09.580]   about what they're actually doing here.
[01:26:09.580 --> 01:26:11.620]   - Go back and do this with WebKit.
[01:26:11.620 --> 01:26:13.820]   - Yeah, neat.
[01:26:13.820 --> 01:26:16.940]   Objective-C files are .m for some reason.
[01:26:16.940 --> 01:26:19.380]   Probably goes, has something to do with the next.
[01:26:19.380 --> 01:26:26.820]   It was probably Avi's BMW license platers.
[01:26:26.820 --> 01:26:31.780]   All right, now that it's illegible, I can move on.
[01:26:31.780 --> 01:26:33.860]   (laughing)
[01:26:33.860 --> 01:26:36.900]   People are doing things.
[01:26:36.900 --> 01:26:38.220]   - Same fractal pattern as I think.
[01:26:38.220 --> 01:26:39.420]   - Things are happening, yeah.
[01:26:39.420 --> 01:26:41.980]   It is, so anyway, this is iOS dev weekly,
[01:26:41.980 --> 01:26:44.660]   had the article and probably explains
[01:26:44.660 --> 01:26:46.140]   how they generated this.
[01:26:46.140 --> 01:26:51.660]   Open source Swift program, it's in here somewhere.
[01:26:51.660 --> 01:26:55.820]   Move and write along, couple of,
[01:26:55.820 --> 01:26:58.180]   I guess we're down to the seeds and the stems.
[01:26:58.180 --> 01:27:02.140]   Mackeeper, oops.
[01:27:02.140 --> 01:27:06.740]   But we've recommended against Mackeeper from day one, right?
[01:27:07.580 --> 01:27:10.540]   But what's sad is the people who are bit by this
[01:27:10.540 --> 01:27:12.740]   are the most vulnerable people,
[01:27:12.740 --> 01:27:14.700]   the people who were sucker enough to buy Mackeeper
[01:27:14.700 --> 01:27:15.540]   in the first place.
[01:27:15.540 --> 01:27:17.700]   - You probably have the same password in many places.
[01:27:17.700 --> 01:27:18.540]   - Yeah.
[01:27:18.540 --> 01:27:19.380]   - You have good security, yeah.
[01:27:19.380 --> 01:27:22.580]   - So Mackeeper, staying true to its heritage,
[01:27:22.580 --> 01:27:27.720]   has stored all the customer information,
[01:27:27.720 --> 01:27:30.380]   13 million, I surprisingly sold 13-million copies,
[01:27:30.380 --> 01:27:34.660]   13 million owners information on a MongoDB
[01:27:34.660 --> 01:27:36.500]   that was on an open share.
[01:27:36.500 --> 01:27:40.860]   So a security researcher using a search engine
[01:27:40.860 --> 01:27:42.580]   that we just, we talk about a lot,
[01:27:42.580 --> 01:27:43.580]   the show-down search engine,
[01:27:43.580 --> 01:27:46.180]   we talk about a lot on security now.
[01:27:46.180 --> 01:27:48.020]   He just was searching around with showed
[01:27:48.020 --> 01:27:51.380]   and found the Mongo database and said,
[01:27:51.380 --> 01:27:52.860]   oh, it's all here.
[01:27:52.860 --> 01:27:55.300]   And in 13 million customer records
[01:27:55.300 --> 01:27:56.420]   were accessible by this guy.
[01:27:56.420 --> 01:27:59.940]   By the way, as far as, this is what Mackeeper says,
[01:27:59.940 --> 01:28:02.100]   as far as they know, he's the only person ever access it
[01:28:02.100 --> 01:28:03.500]   and they talked to him on the phone
[01:28:03.500 --> 01:28:04.780]   and he says he's not gonna do anything with it.
[01:28:04.780 --> 01:28:05.980]   So that's good news.
[01:28:05.980 --> 01:28:08.660]   A selection of, for these customers,
[01:28:08.660 --> 01:28:12.740]   IP addresses, usernames, passwords,
[01:28:12.740 --> 01:28:15.260]   they were hashed, but really crappily hashed
[01:28:15.260 --> 01:28:17.300]   using empty five with that salt.
[01:28:17.300 --> 01:28:20.140]   So easily crackable, especially if you use,
[01:28:20.140 --> 01:28:22.380]   one, two, three, four, five, six is your password.
[01:28:22.380 --> 01:28:26.140]   Phone numbers, email addresses, system information,
[01:28:26.140 --> 01:28:29.100]   software licenses, activation codes,
[01:28:29.100 --> 01:28:32.060]   all on the open internet.
[01:28:32.060 --> 01:28:32.900]   - Wow.
[01:28:32.900 --> 01:28:34.140]   - What the, what?
[01:28:35.060 --> 01:28:38.140]   - Certainly do you get to scamware, but you get hacked
[01:28:38.140 --> 01:28:38.980]   for your phone. - Yeah.
[01:28:38.980 --> 01:28:41.860]   That's kind of the gift that just keeps on giving.
[01:28:41.860 --> 01:28:42.900]   - Yeah.
[01:28:42.900 --> 01:28:46.780]   - Anyway, if you bought Mackeeper from Chrome Tech,
[01:28:46.780 --> 01:28:48.460]   I don't know what to say.
[01:28:48.460 --> 01:28:49.300]   (laughs)
[01:28:49.300 --> 01:28:50.140]   Jokes on you.
[01:28:50.140 --> 01:28:53.140]   What is Mackeeper was supposed to be like,
[01:28:53.140 --> 01:28:54.980]   to clean up utility kind of thing?
[01:28:54.980 --> 01:28:57.340]   - Yeah.
[01:28:57.340 --> 01:29:02.340]   - And it was one of those like catch all utilities
[01:29:02.900 --> 01:29:06.100]   that increases your system performance, finds dead space,
[01:29:06.100 --> 01:29:09.100]   that sort of stuff, but it was,
[01:29:09.100 --> 01:29:13.940]   it advertised so widely that I think almost everybody
[01:29:13.940 --> 01:29:16.740]   in this conversation would get asked about it
[01:29:16.740 --> 01:29:19.180]   by friends and neighbors like a couple of times a month.
[01:29:19.180 --> 01:29:21.580]   And I always have to be diplomatic and say,
[01:29:21.580 --> 01:29:25.420]   well, it's definitely a utility.
[01:29:25.420 --> 01:29:27.500]   Let me steer you towards some free utilities
[01:29:27.500 --> 01:29:29.020]   that are much better than that.
[01:29:29.020 --> 01:29:31.740]   - It wasn't, it wasn't, well now you could say it was bad,
[01:29:31.740 --> 01:29:34.060]   but it wasn't, it wasn't that it was bad so much,
[01:29:34.060 --> 01:29:38.020]   it's just not really anything we would recommend.
[01:29:38.020 --> 01:29:40.900]   - They actually approached, I believe I shouldn't say this.
[01:29:40.900 --> 01:29:42.540]   I think they approached this for advertising.
[01:29:42.540 --> 01:29:43.860]   Didn't we ask you, Renee?
[01:29:43.860 --> 01:29:45.900]   - I wasn't sure if it was Mackeeper or the other one.
[01:29:45.900 --> 01:29:47.260]   - I can't remember.
[01:29:47.260 --> 01:29:48.100]   - I can't remember who it was.
[01:29:48.100 --> 01:29:49.340]   - They're too, they're similar.
[01:29:49.340 --> 01:29:51.100]   That's why I'm kind of being cagey about features.
[01:29:51.100 --> 01:29:53.260]   I don't want to mistake one for the other.
[01:29:53.260 --> 01:29:56.540]   But there's a lot of those utilities
[01:29:56.540 --> 01:29:58.100]   are actually very well intentioned
[01:29:58.100 --> 01:29:59.740]   and they don't cost a lot of money.
[01:29:59.740 --> 01:30:03.260]   But the thing is, in general,
[01:30:03.260 --> 01:30:06.220]   they don't really work well unless you have a team
[01:30:06.220 --> 01:30:09.540]   that is just on top of it day by day by day.
[01:30:09.540 --> 01:30:11.220]   Every single change that Apple makes
[01:30:11.220 --> 01:30:12.660]   to the system directory.
[01:30:12.660 --> 01:30:16.380]   So that utility is not deleting or removing things
[01:30:16.380 --> 01:30:18.140]   that are actually important,
[01:30:18.140 --> 01:30:20.620]   just because the app doesn't recognize it.
[01:30:20.620 --> 01:30:22.460]   And meanwhile, you have manual utilities
[01:30:22.460 --> 01:30:26.780]   like a freebie that's released by Omni Group
[01:30:26.780 --> 01:30:29.500]   that is a lot safer.
[01:30:29.500 --> 01:30:32.460]   So it basically just helps you to recognize stuff
[01:30:32.460 --> 01:30:33.460]   on your drive, for instance,
[01:30:33.460 --> 01:30:34.620]   that's taken too much space.
[01:30:34.620 --> 01:30:35.460]   - I use--
[01:30:35.460 --> 01:30:36.900]   - But it doesn't do anything without your direction.
[01:30:36.900 --> 01:30:40.500]   - For years, I would use a MicroMats Tech Tool Pro.
[01:30:40.500 --> 01:30:42.820]   I don't know if you need that anymore,
[01:30:42.820 --> 01:30:44.020]   but they still make it.
[01:30:44.020 --> 01:30:45.580]   You guys have an opinion on that?
[01:30:45.580 --> 01:30:47.900]   You don't have to be diplomatic.
[01:30:47.900 --> 01:30:49.820]   I just don't see a real need for it.
[01:30:49.820 --> 01:30:52.220]   I mean, I still have, I haven't have it here
[01:30:52.220 --> 01:30:54.500]   'cause I was using it a couple of months ago.
[01:30:54.500 --> 01:30:57.820]   I mean, I think the only tool that I actually rely on
[01:30:57.820 --> 01:30:59.260]   is disc warrior.
[01:30:59.260 --> 01:31:01.140]   - Go, alsoft, good old alsoft.
[01:31:01.140 --> 01:31:01.980]   - Is that still around?
[01:31:01.980 --> 01:31:02.860]   Wow.
[01:31:02.860 --> 01:31:05.460]   - Yeah, yeah, and now it comes on a USB.
[01:31:05.460 --> 01:31:06.300]   - That's awesome, that sounds--
[01:31:06.300 --> 01:31:07.580]   - You can boot off of it.
[01:31:07.580 --> 01:31:11.820]   And it's the classic, if there's, once you are in over your head
[01:31:11.820 --> 01:31:13.300]   and trying to fix something,
[01:31:13.300 --> 01:31:15.260]   this is what will either tell you
[01:31:15.260 --> 01:31:19.300]   that it's worth to struggle on or just have a good Irish
[01:31:19.300 --> 01:31:21.860]   right wake for this drive because unless you wanna give
[01:31:21.860 --> 01:31:24.500]   a couple, give a thousand dollars to drive savers,
[01:31:24.500 --> 01:31:25.460]   this is untouched.
[01:31:25.460 --> 01:31:28.380]   God was offended by the presence of something
[01:31:28.380 --> 01:31:32.180]   on that drive and so he or she raised his or her hand
[01:31:32.180 --> 01:31:34.820]   and made his or her displeasure known.
[01:31:34.820 --> 01:31:36.780]   - I'm glad that a disc warrior is still around.
[01:31:36.780 --> 01:31:37.620]   That is--
[01:31:37.620 --> 01:31:40.140]   - This disc warrior was always the best in my opinion.
[01:31:40.140 --> 01:31:44.700]   You know, I've been using that for so many years.
[01:31:44.700 --> 01:31:46.180]   - Last from the past.
[01:31:46.180 --> 01:31:47.180]   - Yep.
[01:31:47.180 --> 01:31:49.380]   - Generally speaking, modern operating systems
[01:31:49.380 --> 01:31:51.820]   don't really require these kinds of maintenance utility.
[01:31:51.820 --> 01:31:52.660]   - Somebody call me.
[01:31:52.660 --> 01:31:55.060]   - I think in July there was a whole--
[01:31:55.060 --> 01:31:55.900]   - Right, right.
[01:31:55.900 --> 01:31:57.300]   - There was like a vulnerability in Mackeeper
[01:31:57.300 --> 01:31:58.540]   that opened you up to malware.
[01:31:58.540 --> 01:32:00.180]   And not only is it not helping you,
[01:32:00.180 --> 01:32:03.740]   but it's creating extra surface area for attack,
[01:32:03.740 --> 01:32:04.940]   which is really what you don't want.
[01:32:04.940 --> 01:32:06.220]   - Great, great, great.
[01:32:06.220 --> 01:32:07.940]   And generally speaking, I think most of you tell,
[01:32:07.940 --> 01:32:11.500]   you know, the only thing, a hard drive recovery utility,
[01:32:11.500 --> 01:32:13.020]   you know, on the, you know, there's,
[01:32:13.020 --> 01:32:16.420]   on the windows side, there's a lot of good file unerasers
[01:32:16.420 --> 01:32:18.140]   and things like Spinrite.
[01:32:18.140 --> 01:32:19.620]   There are fewer of those on the Mac side,
[01:32:19.620 --> 01:32:22.420]   but modern operating systems don't need to be defragged.
[01:32:22.420 --> 01:32:23.860]   They don't, somebody called me up and said,
[01:32:23.860 --> 01:32:25.980]   "What kind of maintenance should I do to my new,
[01:32:25.980 --> 01:32:27.660]   "my new piece, my Windows 10 PC?"
[01:32:27.660 --> 01:32:30.100]   And I said, "Well, you don't need to change the oil.
[01:32:30.100 --> 01:32:32.540]   "Maybe you want to check the sparks once in a while."
[01:32:32.540 --> 01:32:34.100]   I don't, there's nothing you need to do, really.
[01:32:34.100 --> 01:32:36.220]   - People switching always ask for what's your favorite
[01:32:36.220 --> 01:32:37.220]   antivirus, what are you running?
[01:32:37.220 --> 01:32:38.060]   Like, it keeps saying nothing.
[01:32:38.060 --> 01:32:38.900]   - No, no, no, no.
[01:32:38.900 --> 01:32:41.660]   - It keeps telling people that the amount of effort
[01:32:41.660 --> 01:32:43.420]   that you want to put into these utilities,
[01:32:43.420 --> 01:32:46.140]   put that money and effort into a good backup scheme.
[01:32:46.140 --> 01:32:46.980]   - There you go.
[01:32:46.980 --> 01:32:51.980]   - Because there is, I totally, totally toasted my Mac book
[01:32:51.980 --> 01:32:56.940]   while I was in a hotel room 3,000 miles away.
[01:32:56.940 --> 01:32:59.500]   Because I had a complete backup that was recent,
[01:32:59.500 --> 01:33:01.740]   I was disappointed that I had to go to the Apple store
[01:33:01.740 --> 01:33:04.740]   next to the hotel and spend $2,000 on a new laptop,
[01:33:04.740 --> 01:33:06.940]   but it was never, oh my God, what about my data?
[01:33:06.940 --> 01:33:07.780]   What about this?
[01:33:07.780 --> 01:33:12.340]   It's like, okay, well, I've lost maybe about two kilobytes
[01:33:12.340 --> 01:33:15.780]   of data that I could probably reconstruct from memory.
[01:33:15.780 --> 01:33:20.180]   So again, the ability to just say, oh, damn it,
[01:33:20.180 --> 01:33:23.140]   look at this, this hard drive is completely unrecoverable.
[01:33:23.140 --> 01:33:25.180]   Damn, it's gonna take like a whole day
[01:33:25.180 --> 01:33:27.820]   if I spend the extra $4 for Amazon to deliver
[01:33:27.820 --> 01:33:30.180]   a new hard drive and it might be as much as two hours
[01:33:30.180 --> 01:33:33.020]   after that before I have all of my data back.
[01:33:33.020 --> 01:33:35.860]   Oh, why must Andy always get the fuzzy end of the lollipop?
[01:33:35.860 --> 01:33:39.100]   I mean, any answer that involves you have all of your data
[01:33:39.100 --> 01:33:43.140]   still good is a pretty good solution.
[01:33:43.140 --> 01:33:45.980]   I never thought when I woke up this morning,
[01:33:45.980 --> 01:33:48.460]   I would ever hear a fuzzy end of the lollipop.
[01:33:48.460 --> 01:33:50.060]   (laughing)
[01:33:50.060 --> 01:33:52.260]   That's why every day it's worth getting up,
[01:33:52.260 --> 01:33:53.420]   you never know.
[01:33:53.420 --> 01:33:54.260]   What's going on?
[01:33:54.260 --> 01:33:55.900]   I need an Andy word that there's something today.
[01:33:55.900 --> 01:33:56.940]   I'll tell you one other thing,
[01:33:56.940 --> 01:33:59.180]   if you're an app developer, remember the app store
[01:33:59.180 --> 01:34:02.660]   is closed as always, December 22nd through 29th
[01:34:02.660 --> 01:34:05.020]   the Christmas week, they let them go home
[01:34:05.020 --> 01:34:06.660]   and so they will not be accepting app
[01:34:06.660 --> 01:34:08.580]   or app update submissions.
[01:34:08.580 --> 01:34:11.140]   So you might wanna get,
[01:34:11.140 --> 01:34:14.100]   hurry up with that big bug fix and get it out.
[01:34:14.100 --> 01:34:15.660]   And then take a break, relax, have a relax.
[01:34:15.660 --> 01:34:16.500]   And then relax.
[01:34:16.500 --> 01:34:19.220]   Yeah, that's what they're doing in the app store.
[01:34:19.220 --> 01:34:22.260]   How big is that group, do we know?
[01:34:22.260 --> 01:34:24.340]   It depends, there's a whole bunch of different people there.
[01:34:24.340 --> 01:34:26.020]   There's the actual app review team
[01:34:26.020 --> 01:34:28.260]   and then there's developer relations
[01:34:28.260 --> 01:34:31.140]   and there's evangelism and there's story editorials
[01:34:31.140 --> 01:34:32.420]   for management.
[01:34:32.420 --> 01:34:35.580]   Yeah, you wanna get a Tesla iPhone case?
[01:34:35.580 --> 01:34:38.380]   Now you can. (laughing)
[01:34:38.380 --> 01:34:40.860]   Tesla's using leftover upholstery leather.
[01:34:40.860 --> 01:34:42.100]   What's cars?
[01:34:42.100 --> 01:34:45.260]   To make iPhone cases with the Tesla imprint,
[01:34:45.260 --> 01:34:46.460]   it's made-- - It's aspirational.
[01:34:46.460 --> 01:34:47.860]   - I like it.
[01:34:47.860 --> 01:34:50.060]   Can't afford a car, get an RFID blocking
[01:34:50.060 --> 01:34:52.140]   leather iPhone wallet case.
[01:34:52.140 --> 01:34:55.500]   They have them for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus
[01:34:55.500 --> 01:34:57.540]   and I presume that means the 6S and 6 Plus.
[01:34:57.540 --> 01:35:00.900]   And they're not expensive, only $45.
[01:35:00.900 --> 01:35:03.580]   They'll even add credit card slots for an additional 5.
[01:35:03.580 --> 01:35:05.740]   - Does it block Apple Pay?
[01:35:05.740 --> 01:35:08.180]   - It's an RFID blocking, I think that's actually
[01:35:08.180 --> 01:35:09.660]   a good thing, right?
[01:35:09.660 --> 01:35:10.660]   - Yeah, I just don't know how far
[01:35:10.660 --> 01:35:12.460]   'cause NFC is a subset of RFID.
[01:35:12.460 --> 01:35:13.740]   - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:35:13.740 --> 01:35:14.660]   - It blocks Apple Pay.
[01:35:14.660 --> 01:35:16.580]   - Oh, I bet it does.
[01:35:16.580 --> 01:35:18.780]   Well, that's what you got the watch for, right?
[01:35:18.780 --> 01:35:21.380]   They also make Tesla Cliffs,
[01:35:21.380 --> 01:35:23.260]   which are, by the way, touchscreen friendly.
[01:35:23.260 --> 01:35:25.900]   So I guess they've got capacitive fibers in there.
[01:35:25.900 --> 01:35:28.460]   - That's so funny.
[01:35:28.460 --> 01:35:29.300]   - That would be funny.
[01:35:29.300 --> 01:35:31.580]   That would be a real like American,
[01:35:31.580 --> 01:35:34.820]   like 1983 automotive industry sort of thing
[01:35:34.820 --> 01:35:37.740]   to sell like Chrysler gloves that can't,
[01:35:37.740 --> 01:35:39.780]   for the Chrysler touchscreen and the entire car
[01:35:39.780 --> 01:35:40.860]   could not be operated with.
[01:35:40.860 --> 01:35:42.420]   - Without a Chrysler glove.
[01:35:42.420 --> 01:35:45.460]   - And you know, Apple can't put project
[01:35:45.460 --> 01:35:47.180]   Titan gloves in cases out there yet.
[01:35:47.180 --> 01:35:48.900]   So it's just totally unfair competition.
[01:35:48.900 --> 01:35:50.100]   - It's just not right.
[01:35:50.100 --> 01:35:53.060]   I think that's pretty funny.
[01:35:53.060 --> 01:35:56.660]   Let's see, Seize and Stem's, a couple more things.
[01:35:56.660 --> 01:35:59.700]   Oh, Samsung's going to the Supreme Court.
[01:35:59.700 --> 01:36:03.660]   Remember Samsung wrote a check for $548 million last week
[01:36:03.660 --> 01:36:05.980]   and they asked, "Hey, if this gets overturned
[01:36:05.980 --> 01:36:08.820]   by the Supreme Court, can we get our money back?"
[01:36:08.820 --> 01:36:13.820]   Apple said, "No, but the Supreme Court is going to be petitioned."
[01:36:13.820 --> 01:36:17.460]   Actually, I think this might be an interesting case
[01:36:17.460 --> 01:36:20.740]   because it extends beyond the narrow realm
[01:36:20.740 --> 01:36:25.420]   of Samsung versus Apple, but more to how a jury
[01:36:25.420 --> 01:36:28.020]   is to understand what a design patent is.
[01:36:28.020 --> 01:36:32.060]   Samsung said they weren't given the information they need.
[01:36:32.060 --> 01:36:34.620]   They weren't competent to make the decision
[01:36:34.620 --> 01:36:37.060]   on the design patent.
[01:36:37.060 --> 01:36:39.020]   - Yeah, Anna, our round wreck is different
[01:36:39.020 --> 01:36:40.140]   than their round wreck, yeah.
[01:36:40.140 --> 01:36:41.620]   It's whole core of data order.
[01:36:41.620 --> 01:36:44.260]   - I don't disagree with this
[01:36:44.260 --> 01:36:46.740]   and I think the Supremes might take it up.
[01:36:46.740 --> 01:36:48.900]   We don't know yet, but I could see them taking up
[01:36:48.900 --> 01:36:51.380]   on that larger issue.
[01:36:51.380 --> 01:36:52.740]   Sometimes they prefer not to.
[01:36:52.740 --> 01:36:53.580]   They say what do you want to do?
[01:36:53.580 --> 01:36:55.260]   - Samsung should just pay.
[01:36:55.260 --> 01:36:56.540]   - Oh, they did.
[01:36:56.540 --> 01:36:57.380]   They wrote the check.
[01:36:57.380 --> 01:36:58.220]   - Just pay.
[01:36:58.220 --> 01:36:59.060]   - Yeah, they did.
[01:36:59.060 --> 01:36:59.900]   - But it's not done.
[01:36:59.900 --> 01:37:01.980]   They wrote the check, but it's not done.
[01:37:01.980 --> 01:37:04.860]   I wonder if it is a check.
[01:37:04.860 --> 01:37:06.180]   How do you?
[01:37:06.180 --> 01:37:07.380]   - Maybe we saw it was a wire transfer.
[01:37:07.380 --> 01:37:08.620]   They had it up on Twitter earlier.
[01:37:08.620 --> 01:37:09.780]   - It was a wire transfer.
[01:37:09.780 --> 01:37:12.580]   - Yeah, they paid it today, I think.
[01:37:12.580 --> 01:37:13.420]   - That's cool.
[01:37:13.420 --> 01:37:15.660]   Huh.
[01:37:15.660 --> 01:37:18.540]   All right, take a break.
[01:37:18.540 --> 01:37:20.940]   Get ready, your picks of the week next.
[01:37:20.940 --> 01:37:23.260]   And Jim, I want you to pick your favorite
[01:37:23.260 --> 01:37:24.780]   Metal Christmas song.
[01:37:24.780 --> 01:37:28.260]   - Oh.
[01:37:28.260 --> 01:37:30.980]   - Yeah, see, a challenge.
[01:37:30.980 --> 01:37:33.340]   - What plays at Casa del Rumpel on Christmas morning?
[01:37:33.340 --> 01:37:38.020]   - I remember going to a celebrity skins concert,
[01:37:38.020 --> 01:37:40.340]   Christmas concert, it was awesome.
[01:37:40.340 --> 01:37:44.060]   I don't know, you probably don't remember that.
[01:37:44.060 --> 01:37:45.780]   I don't know if you call them Metal.
[01:37:45.780 --> 01:37:47.780]   I don't think they were more like punk.
[01:37:47.780 --> 01:37:51.820]   They wore Christmas presents on their feet though,
[01:37:51.820 --> 01:37:54.740]   and they sang the most amazing punk
[01:37:54.740 --> 01:37:56.700]   Carol of the Bells I've ever heard.
[01:37:56.700 --> 01:37:59.180]   - Our show today brought to you by this.
[01:37:59.180 --> 01:38:00.500]   Wait a minute, let me get it for you.
[01:38:00.500 --> 01:38:03.900]   My Drobo, God, I love the Drobo.
[01:38:03.900 --> 01:38:05.580]   This is the new Drobo mini.
[01:38:05.580 --> 01:38:09.140]   You know, it's funny, I have it, I can't take it home
[01:38:09.140 --> 01:38:11.460]   'cause we do the Drobo ads and I wanna show you the Drobo,
[01:38:11.460 --> 01:38:13.820]   but I love this.
[01:38:13.820 --> 01:38:15.380]   Drobo, you know about Drobo,
[01:38:15.380 --> 01:38:18.540]   it's the safe, simple, expandable storage solution
[01:38:18.540 --> 01:38:20.580]   for all your needs.
[01:38:20.580 --> 01:38:23.620]   They offer a family of external storage arrays.
[01:38:23.620 --> 01:38:25.300]   Add your own drives, you can even order them
[01:38:25.300 --> 01:38:26.820]   with drives preloaded.
[01:38:26.820 --> 01:38:28.300]   This is the Drobo mini.
[01:38:28.300 --> 01:38:30.180]   It's lightweight, it's portable.
[01:38:30.180 --> 01:38:33.340]   So if you're a video editor, a photographer,
[01:38:33.340 --> 01:38:35.060]   you need a lot of storage.
[01:38:35.060 --> 01:38:37.380]   I just, by the way, all Drobo cases have
[01:38:37.380 --> 01:38:40.780]   this wonderful magnetic front piece.
[01:38:40.780 --> 01:38:42.300]   And the lights, I should plug it in
[01:38:42.300 --> 01:38:43.740]   'cause the lights that go all the way around it
[01:38:43.740 --> 01:38:45.260]   tell you exactly what's going on.
[01:38:45.260 --> 01:38:47.260]   Very easy to remove the front piece
[01:38:47.260 --> 01:38:49.740]   and see the drives in action.
[01:38:49.740 --> 01:38:51.180]   These are the drive bays.
[01:38:51.180 --> 01:38:54.700]   Even swap 'em while the Drobo is working,
[01:38:54.700 --> 01:38:56.420]   which is fantastic.
[01:38:56.420 --> 01:38:59.140]   Drobo makes amazing stuff.
[01:38:59.140 --> 01:39:02.260]   This is just over two pounds, four drive bays.
[01:39:02.260 --> 01:39:04.100]   Each drive could be up to two terabytes.
[01:39:04.100 --> 01:39:06.140]   That means eight terabytes.
[01:39:06.140 --> 01:39:09.500]   If you get the 5D, you got five three and a half inch drives
[01:39:09.500 --> 01:39:12.580]   in a maximum capacity of 64 terabytes.
[01:39:12.580 --> 01:39:15.260]   And both of them have something underneath here,
[01:39:15.260 --> 01:39:16.660]   which is so cool.
[01:39:16.660 --> 01:39:17.660]   Let me pry this open.
[01:39:17.660 --> 01:39:20.420]   I need a finger nail.
[01:39:20.420 --> 01:39:21.740]   I need a penny.
[01:39:21.740 --> 01:39:26.740]   But under here is the optional MSATA SSD acceleration bay,
[01:39:27.620 --> 01:39:29.500]   which accelerates small file reads.
[01:39:29.500 --> 01:39:32.300]   It's kind of like it's a disk cache in here.
[01:39:32.300 --> 01:39:34.460]   So if you've got image library software
[01:39:34.460 --> 01:39:39.340]   like Lightroom or Apple Photos, Aputure, iPhoto,
[01:39:39.340 --> 01:39:42.340]   bring me a, I need a quarter is what I need.
[01:39:42.340 --> 01:39:44.500]   Like a little, just a, I don't know if a screwdriver
[01:39:44.500 --> 01:39:46.740]   might, it's plastic, let's see.
[01:39:46.740 --> 01:39:47.660]   Yeah, I guess this will work.
[01:39:47.660 --> 01:39:50.700]   I wanna unlock it and show you the little MSATA card in here.
[01:39:50.700 --> 01:39:52.540]   This is so cool.
[01:39:52.540 --> 01:39:53.940]   I love this.
[01:39:53.940 --> 01:39:56.180]   You know, this adds a little bit to the expense.
[01:39:56.180 --> 01:39:59.900]   But you know, if you're a pro, time is money, right?
[01:39:59.900 --> 01:40:01.820]   You don't, I go too far.
[01:40:01.820 --> 01:40:03.780]   You don't want to, there it is.
[01:40:03.780 --> 01:40:06.540]   You don't, you know, the speed with which you can work
[01:40:06.540 --> 01:40:09.780]   with those files makes a huge difference.
[01:40:09.780 --> 01:40:11.140]   This is a little MSATA card.
[01:40:11.140 --> 01:40:12.900]   I think this is how big is this one?
[01:40:12.900 --> 01:40:15.500]   64 gigs or no, 250 gigs.
[01:40:15.500 --> 01:40:19.180]   That acts like a cache for the drives in here.
[01:40:19.180 --> 01:40:21.300]   Everything's so thoughtful in the Drobo.
[01:40:21.300 --> 01:40:25.020]   Two Thunderbolt ports or USB three.
[01:40:25.900 --> 01:40:29.580]   Even, I love this, the power cable is locking.
[01:40:29.580 --> 01:40:31.860]   'Cause the last thing you wanna do if you're working
[01:40:31.860 --> 01:40:34.020]   on the last few minutes of a big edit
[01:40:34.020 --> 01:40:37.540]   in your hotel suite at CES.
[01:40:37.540 --> 01:40:39.740]   And the power, and you trip over the power cord
[01:40:39.740 --> 01:40:42.140]   and pulls out, that's not good.
[01:40:42.140 --> 01:40:45.820]   So the power cord twists and is lockable, which is awesome.
[01:40:45.820 --> 01:40:47.580]   I really love the designers at Drobo.
[01:40:47.580 --> 01:40:50.220]   They make their stuff better and better and better.
[01:40:50.220 --> 01:40:53.500]   The 5N, that's for network attached storage.
[01:40:53.500 --> 01:40:56.420]   As a media server, a file server, a backup solution,
[01:40:56.420 --> 01:40:58.700]   you just plug it into your switch or your router.
[01:40:58.700 --> 01:40:59.540]   You're ready to go,
[01:40:59.540 --> 01:41:01.540]   absolutely back updated to two different
[01:41:01.540 --> 01:41:03.620]   cloud service providers.
[01:41:03.620 --> 01:41:07.500]   Built in, or, or, and I really like this,
[01:41:07.500 --> 01:41:09.180]   use BitTorrent Sync.
[01:41:09.180 --> 01:41:10.940]   Isn't that cool?
[01:41:10.940 --> 01:41:12.580]   That's in the software.
[01:41:12.580 --> 01:41:15.100]   It also works with Plex, the new Apple TV2.
[01:41:15.100 --> 01:41:20.300]   So take your choice, the Mini, the 5D, the 5N.
[01:41:20.300 --> 01:41:24.940]   All of them reliable because of Drobo's better than RAID,
[01:41:24.940 --> 01:41:27.380]   beyond RAID technology.
[01:41:27.380 --> 01:41:30.180]   And you can expand on the fly, you can mix and match drives.
[01:41:30.180 --> 01:41:32.300]   You know, usually with RAID, the smallest drive
[01:41:32.300 --> 01:41:34.300]   determines the size of the array.
[01:41:34.300 --> 01:41:37.060]   Not with Drobo, you can have heterogeneous drives in there
[01:41:37.060 --> 01:41:38.420]   and it'll use every byte.
[01:41:38.420 --> 01:41:43.340]   And Drobo's have an external, or internal EUSB device
[01:41:43.340 --> 01:41:45.780]   where data is copied if there's a power failure.
[01:41:45.780 --> 01:41:48.500]   So should you knock the cable out?
[01:41:48.500 --> 01:41:49.620]   You're not out of luck.
[01:41:49.620 --> 01:41:51.380]   It predicts against long outages as well.
[01:41:51.380 --> 01:41:53.140]   I really like the Drobo.
[01:41:53.140 --> 01:41:54.940]   Those colored lights in the front make it very easy
[01:41:54.940 --> 01:41:56.900]   to figure out what's going on inside your Drobo.
[01:41:56.900 --> 01:41:58.980]   And when you need more storage,
[01:41:58.980 --> 01:42:01.140]   the nice thing is you can populate it with drives
[01:42:01.140 --> 01:42:03.180]   you got lying around and as you need more storage,
[01:42:03.180 --> 01:42:05.220]   go out and get a bigger drive, pop it in.
[01:42:05.220 --> 01:42:06.820]   You don't have to power down.
[01:42:06.820 --> 01:42:09.300]   And everything's working again.
[01:42:09.300 --> 01:42:11.980]   Thunderbolt, gigabit, USB3 connections,
[01:42:11.980 --> 01:42:14.020]   Drobo.com/trit to learn more.
[01:42:14.020 --> 01:42:16.500]   And if you're gonna get yourself a Drobo for the holidays,
[01:42:16.500 --> 01:42:19.020]   make sure you use our offer code TWIT100.
[01:42:19.020 --> 01:42:21.620]   You'll save 100 bucks off the purchase of a Drobo mini,
[01:42:21.620 --> 01:42:24.820]   Drobo 4bay or Drobo 5N.
[01:42:24.820 --> 01:42:29.340]   DROB.com/twit.
[01:42:29.340 --> 01:42:33.180]   And don't forget the offer code TWIT100 to save 100 bucks.
[01:42:33.180 --> 01:42:35.500]   Drobo.
[01:42:35.500 --> 01:42:38.620]   Andy Inaco, your pick of the week.
[01:42:38.620 --> 01:42:42.940]   My pick of the week, I don't have a heavy metal
[01:42:42.940 --> 01:42:43.740]   favorite Christmas song.
[01:42:43.740 --> 01:42:45.580]   I do have a favorite Scott Christmas song.
[01:42:45.580 --> 01:42:47.220]   It is of course, "Oi to the World."
[01:42:47.220 --> 01:42:48.820]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:42:48.820 --> 01:42:50.260]   Did you say "Oi to the World"?
[01:42:50.260 --> 01:42:52.260]   "Oi to the World."
[01:42:52.260 --> 01:42:55.300]   There's originally written by the Vandals,
[01:42:55.300 --> 01:42:58.100]   but it was covered by no doubt for Christmas albums.
[01:42:58.100 --> 01:42:59.460]   Oh, that sounds good.
[01:42:59.460 --> 01:43:03.940]   One of those yearly AIDS tribute Christmas songs.
[01:43:03.940 --> 01:43:05.020]   Oh, Andy.
[01:43:05.020 --> 01:43:06.260]   Just throwing it out there.
[01:43:06.260 --> 01:43:07.620]   I just want to--
[01:43:07.620 --> 01:43:10.020]   But for actual pick of the week is this thing here,
[01:43:10.020 --> 01:43:12.220]   it's called the Ring Video Doorbell.
[01:43:12.220 --> 01:43:14.060]   Oh, you don't have to pick that.
[01:43:14.060 --> 01:43:16.100]   I have to just claim this.
[01:43:16.100 --> 01:43:17.340]   They're a sponsor.
[01:43:17.340 --> 01:43:18.980]   You don't know that.
[01:43:18.980 --> 01:43:20.820]   I did not know they're a sponsor.
[01:43:20.820 --> 01:43:21.980]   I just got this in the office.
[01:43:21.980 --> 01:43:23.500]   It's so awesome.
[01:43:23.500 --> 01:43:24.700]   I have one too.
[01:43:24.700 --> 01:43:25.660]   It's such a cool idea.
[01:43:25.660 --> 01:43:27.620]   So basically, this is a doorbell
[01:43:27.620 --> 01:43:31.220]   that you can just mount on your door,
[01:43:31.220 --> 01:43:32.980]   like any other doorbell.
[01:43:32.980 --> 01:43:39.900]   But the cool thing is that it has a HD video camera right here.
[01:43:39.900 --> 01:43:42.140]   And when someone rings the doorbell at the front there,
[01:43:42.140 --> 01:43:43.700]   they get an audio thing so they know
[01:43:43.700 --> 01:43:45.180]   that the doorbell has been pushed.
[01:43:45.180 --> 01:43:48.100]   Meanwhile, you get an alert on your phone somewhere else
[01:43:48.100 --> 01:43:49.260]   in the house.
[01:43:49.260 --> 01:43:53.100]   The camera gets turned on, and you can now see who is there.
[01:43:53.100 --> 01:43:54.540]   And just like getting a phone call,
[01:43:54.540 --> 01:43:56.900]   if it's someone you don't want to talk to,
[01:43:56.900 --> 01:43:59.260]   like if it's a salesperson or something,
[01:43:59.260 --> 01:44:02.700]   you can just decline the doorbell.
[01:44:02.700 --> 01:44:05.460]   And they'll just give up and walk away.
[01:44:05.460 --> 01:44:07.620]   Or if you're putting on your shoes
[01:44:07.620 --> 01:44:09.220]   because you've been expecting the delivery
[01:44:09.220 --> 01:44:11.580]   of your new Apple Pencil, but you've got to sign for it,
[01:44:11.580 --> 01:44:13.500]   you can then activate the phone and say,
[01:44:13.500 --> 01:44:14.580]   okay, I'm on my way down.
[01:44:14.580 --> 01:44:17.620]   And you have actually a two-way audio,
[01:44:17.620 --> 01:44:21.220]   one-way video conversation with whoever's there at the door.
[01:44:21.220 --> 01:44:22.780]   It's also as a motion detector,
[01:44:22.780 --> 01:44:25.100]   so it'll also put an alert on your phone
[01:44:25.100 --> 01:44:27.900]   whenever it detects a car pulling into the driveway
[01:44:27.900 --> 01:44:30.860]   or someone walking up to the doorstep.
[01:44:30.860 --> 01:44:33.220]   So you can also just use it as a peep,
[01:44:33.220 --> 01:44:35.260]   all just to see what's going on there.
[01:44:35.260 --> 01:44:37.540]   And also, it's also security too,
[01:44:37.540 --> 01:44:41.020]   because it will record when there's motion.
[01:44:41.020 --> 01:44:43.860]   It will record video of what's going on there.
[01:44:43.860 --> 01:44:46.140]   And also send you an alert to what's happening.
[01:44:46.140 --> 01:44:51.140]   And for $30 a year, it will store all that stuff in the cloud
[01:44:51.140 --> 01:44:54.380]   so that once that stuff gets recorded,
[01:44:54.380 --> 01:44:55.940]   it will be safely in the cloud.
[01:44:55.940 --> 01:44:59.740]   You can look at it remotely, or if something bad is happening,
[01:44:59.740 --> 01:45:01.460]   has happened, someone broke in,
[01:45:01.460 --> 01:45:03.140]   or someone, when those kids, you know,
[01:45:03.140 --> 01:45:07.540]   TP'd your trees, you can probably send the video
[01:45:07.540 --> 01:45:09.180]   to the proper authorities.
[01:45:09.180 --> 01:45:11.180]   It installs pretty well.
[01:45:11.180 --> 01:45:14.140]   If it has its own built-in battery,
[01:45:14.140 --> 01:45:16.220]   so if you don't mind unscrewing it
[01:45:16.220 --> 01:45:17.820]   from this mounting plate that you screwed
[01:45:17.820 --> 01:45:18.660]   into the side of your house
[01:45:18.660 --> 01:45:20.740]   and recharging it once every couple of months,
[01:45:20.740 --> 01:45:23.540]   you can do that, or you can actually just use the wiring
[01:45:23.540 --> 01:45:26.580]   that's in your existing doorbell and power it that way.
[01:45:26.580 --> 01:45:28.020]   And there's the only downside is
[01:45:28.020 --> 01:45:29.580]   that there's a little bit of latency
[01:45:29.580 --> 01:45:32.780]   with the between the doorbell and the doorbell
[01:45:32.780 --> 01:45:34.220]   and the phone app.
[01:45:34.220 --> 01:45:37.900]   So if you really are dealing with like a UPS driver
[01:45:37.900 --> 01:45:40.300]   who has got written up last week
[01:45:40.300 --> 01:45:43.500]   because he's been taking 48 seconds per delivery
[01:45:43.500 --> 01:45:45.900]   and he's to get that down to 32.
[01:45:45.900 --> 01:45:49.220]   He might give, he or she might give up after like four seconds.
[01:45:49.220 --> 01:45:52.100]   He might already be back in the truck by the time you get
[01:45:52.100 --> 01:45:53.660]   downstairs and you get the alert.
[01:45:53.660 --> 01:45:55.580]   It's not like a long latency, but again,
[01:45:55.580 --> 01:45:57.940]   if it's a possibility, someone just, you know,
[01:45:57.940 --> 01:46:01.220]   giving up too soon, but you can buy like a little accessory.
[01:46:01.220 --> 01:46:04.620]   That's just a radio receiver, just regular like doorbell
[01:46:04.620 --> 01:46:05.580]   sound thing.
[01:46:05.580 --> 01:46:09.180]   And so it'll just be a sound ringing throughout the house
[01:46:09.180 --> 01:46:12.500]   that doesn't require access to Wi-Fi or access things like that.
[01:46:12.500 --> 01:46:13.500]   Cool stuff.
[01:46:13.500 --> 01:46:15.940]   It's a 200 bucks, which is not terribly cheap,
[01:46:15.940 --> 01:46:18.580]   but given the amount number of times where
[01:46:18.580 --> 01:46:21.940]   I have had to take up residency in like the living room
[01:46:21.940 --> 01:46:23.540]   because I know that I'm going to be getting
[01:46:23.540 --> 01:46:25.940]   an important delivery and I don't want to afford
[01:46:25.940 --> 01:46:28.300]   to be somewhere else in the house and not hear the doorbell
[01:46:28.300 --> 01:46:31.020]   or not hear the someone knocking at the door,
[01:46:31.020 --> 01:46:32.860]   that's pretty much the kind of device
[01:46:32.860 --> 01:46:35.540]   I've been looking for for a good long time.
[01:46:35.540 --> 01:46:37.300]   Fantabulous.
[01:46:37.300 --> 01:46:39.780]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:46:39.780 --> 01:46:48.940]   Boy, that kind of boy.
[01:46:48.940 --> 01:46:51.020]   I thought it was like, it's like--
[01:46:51.020 --> 01:46:52.940]   Hey, it's like--
[01:46:52.940 --> 01:46:54.300]   That kind of boy.
[01:46:54.300 --> 01:46:55.980]   Yes.
[01:46:55.980 --> 01:46:56.900]   That's funny.
[01:46:56.900 --> 01:46:58.940]   Yeah, the Ring doorbell, once again,
[01:46:58.940 --> 01:47:00.460]   a little disclaimer, they are an advertiser,
[01:47:00.460 --> 01:47:01.620]   but Andy didn't know that.
[01:47:01.620 --> 01:47:02.820]   I was not aware of that.
[01:47:02.820 --> 01:47:05.420]   So this is in no way a paid announcement.
[01:47:05.420 --> 01:47:06.940]   One thing that really impressed me about them,
[01:47:06.940 --> 01:47:08.740]   is Georgia got one too, and she hates anything
[01:47:08.740 --> 01:47:09.740]   to do with the cloud.
[01:47:09.740 --> 01:47:10.980]   She's a huge privacy advocate.
[01:47:10.980 --> 01:47:12.700]   So she said, can I just turn all that cloud stuff off?
[01:47:12.700 --> 01:47:13.420]   They said, yep, no problem.
[01:47:13.420 --> 01:47:14.500]   Just use it locally.
[01:47:14.500 --> 01:47:15.220]   Whatever you like.
[01:47:15.220 --> 01:47:16.860]   And here's the irony of it.
[01:47:16.860 --> 01:47:21.220]   My Apple watch just rang with the Ring video doorbell.
[01:47:21.220 --> 01:47:23.860]   There's motion at my front door.
[01:47:23.860 --> 01:47:27.180]   You want to talk about like really bad timing.
[01:47:27.180 --> 01:47:30.700]   They sent me FedEx that arrived like, let's say,
[01:47:30.700 --> 01:47:34.420]   4 o'clock in the afternoon, like on Friday.
[01:47:34.420 --> 01:47:38.060]   Like 2 o'clock for the only the second time
[01:47:38.060 --> 01:47:41.260]   that I've been living here, actual Jehovah's Witnesses
[01:47:41.260 --> 01:47:42.340]   came to the door.
[01:47:42.340 --> 01:47:43.340]   Quick hug.
[01:47:43.340 --> 01:47:44.340]   Quick hug.
[01:47:44.340 --> 01:47:46.620]   I almost wish that I'd like taken one of their magazines.
[01:47:46.620 --> 01:47:49.780]   So I called-- look, can you come back at 2 p.m.
[01:47:49.780 --> 01:47:53.740]   on Monday so I can take some screenshots of this phone?
[01:47:53.740 --> 01:47:55.020]   They were fine.
[01:47:55.020 --> 01:47:56.180]   They were wonderful people.
[01:47:56.180 --> 01:48:00.140]   It was as friendly and fast a transaction as possible,
[01:48:00.140 --> 01:48:02.460]   saying, oh, I'm sorry, I don't like to discuss this sort of thing.
[01:48:02.460 --> 01:48:03.460]   They're also--
[01:48:03.460 --> 01:48:04.060]   No, they're sweating.
[01:48:04.060 --> 01:48:04.980]   They're very kind.
[01:48:04.980 --> 01:48:07.260]   Again, they were polite as hell.
[01:48:07.260 --> 01:48:08.180]   And you get--
[01:48:08.180 --> 01:48:12.340]   And the Wake magazine is great to keep in your waiting room
[01:48:12.340 --> 01:48:13.700]   for--
[01:48:13.700 --> 01:48:14.660]   I have texture, I don't think.
[01:48:14.660 --> 01:48:16.580]   Yeah.
[01:48:16.580 --> 01:48:18.660]   Renee Richie, your pick of the week.
[01:48:18.660 --> 01:48:20.540]   So my pick of the week, actually,
[01:48:20.540 --> 01:48:22.060]   I was hoping to pick it last week.
[01:48:22.060 --> 01:48:24.460]   But once again, it didn't come up quite in time for the show.
[01:48:24.460 --> 01:48:26.540]   But it's DJ Pro, not for the Mac this time,
[01:48:26.540 --> 01:48:28.100]   but for the iPad Pro.
[01:48:28.100 --> 01:48:29.580]   It's made by the same company.
[01:48:29.580 --> 01:48:32.820]   Algorithm, they've been doing Mac DJ software for a long time.
[01:48:32.820 --> 01:48:34.820]   They made the iPad and the iPhone app.
[01:48:34.820 --> 01:48:36.620]   And they decided because they are--
[01:48:36.620 --> 01:48:37.260]   they're insane.
[01:48:37.260 --> 01:48:37.740]   I'm just going to say it.
[01:48:37.740 --> 01:48:38.260]   They're insane.
[01:48:38.260 --> 01:48:40.860]   They decided to make a version that works on the iPad.
[01:48:40.860 --> 01:48:42.860]   And they take full use of all the features.
[01:48:42.860 --> 01:48:45.580]   So you get-- and I stuck a video in the doc
[01:48:45.580 --> 01:48:46.940]   too, if you want to look at it at the same time.
[01:48:46.940 --> 01:48:51.140]   But you can do four turn tables on the iPad Pro version.
[01:48:51.140 --> 01:48:51.640]   Whoa.
[01:48:51.640 --> 01:48:52.740]   It multitasks.
[01:48:52.740 --> 01:48:55.540]   Apple's music app doesn't do multi-tasking yet,
[01:48:55.540 --> 01:48:57.380]   but DJ Pro does.
[01:48:57.380 --> 01:48:58.460]   It's got all the effects.
[01:48:58.460 --> 01:49:01.180]   It takes maximum use of all that screen size.
[01:49:01.180 --> 01:49:05.260]   It is-- it makes me wish that I had any musical talent at all.
[01:49:05.260 --> 01:49:06.220]   And I absolutely do not.
[01:49:06.220 --> 01:49:07.500]   But I'll still sit there playing with it
[01:49:07.500 --> 01:49:08.580]   and making horrific sounds.
[01:49:08.580 --> 01:49:11.260]   But it's so much fun that I can't stop doing it.
[01:49:11.260 --> 01:49:13.780]   And you can play your music.
[01:49:13.780 --> 01:49:15.220]   But really, if you are a professional,
[01:49:15.220 --> 01:49:17.460]   they got full keyboard shortcut support
[01:49:17.460 --> 01:49:21.260]   so that-- I didn't expect any of that in a DJ app.
[01:49:21.260 --> 01:49:23.540]   But they have tons and tons of keyboard shortcuts
[01:49:23.540 --> 01:49:25.620]   because they think that people with iPad Pros
[01:49:25.620 --> 01:49:27.620]   will use it with the keyboard.
[01:49:27.620 --> 01:49:30.660]   And it's still got the Spotify integration.
[01:49:30.660 --> 01:49:34.340]   And they got rid of this moreific rendering
[01:49:34.340 --> 01:49:36.900]   on the actual records, which I kind of missed.
[01:49:36.900 --> 01:49:39.740]   But they replaced it with this jog sort of functionality,
[01:49:39.740 --> 01:49:41.220]   which is really, really good.
[01:49:41.220 --> 01:49:43.700]   And I got to watch one of their demos.
[01:49:43.700 --> 01:49:46.380]   And it was really impressive what people can do with this.
[01:49:46.380 --> 01:49:47.660]   And it really shows--
[01:49:47.660 --> 01:49:48.620]   they're one of those companies.
[01:49:48.620 --> 01:49:49.940]   It used to be--
[01:49:49.940 --> 01:49:51.780]   I forget the name of the company that I bought by EA,
[01:49:51.780 --> 01:49:52.940]   that made the real racing game.
[01:49:52.940 --> 01:49:54.900]   And the minute a new hardware came out,
[01:49:54.900 --> 01:49:56.900]   they would push the limits of that platform.
[01:49:56.900 --> 01:49:59.660]   And that kind of feels what algorithm is doing now with DJ.
[01:49:59.660 --> 01:50:02.220]   And I'm just super impressed by it.
[01:50:02.220 --> 01:50:05.900]   So if you have an inner mixer, an inner MC in you,
[01:50:05.900 --> 01:50:07.500]   give this a try.
[01:50:07.500 --> 01:50:11.180]   So I'm just running my ring video.
[01:50:11.180 --> 01:50:12.260]   And I'll ring a turntable.
[01:50:12.260 --> 01:50:14.900]   They're out front.
[01:50:14.900 --> 01:50:18.940]   Here they come with my Christmas gifts.
[01:50:18.940 --> 01:50:19.700]   That is awesome.
[01:50:19.700 --> 01:50:21.460]   And you know, that is exactly what
[01:50:21.460 --> 01:50:25.780]   I was thinking the iPad Pro with the right app
[01:50:25.780 --> 01:50:28.180]   for the right person is exactly made for.
[01:50:28.180 --> 01:50:31.740]   You saw it was docked onto the physical turntable--
[01:50:31.740 --> 01:50:35.620]   not record turntable, but those metal controls.
[01:50:35.620 --> 01:50:36.820]   It's compatible with all of those.
[01:50:36.820 --> 01:50:39.020]   I can totally see.
[01:50:39.020 --> 01:50:41.460]   I mean, that makes so much sense.
[01:50:41.460 --> 01:50:42.500]   I hope we see more of those.
[01:50:42.500 --> 01:50:44.540]   That's on sale, I guess.
[01:50:44.540 --> 01:50:45.420]   Yeah, it's on sale.
[01:50:45.420 --> 01:50:47.100]   Because it's on sale right now.
[01:50:47.100 --> 01:50:47.940]   Yeah, it's around $20.
[01:50:47.940 --> 01:50:50.300]   I forget what's going to go to like $30 or $40 or something.
[01:50:50.300 --> 01:50:52.020]   But just buy it.
[01:50:52.020 --> 01:50:52.660]   Gift it.
[01:50:52.660 --> 01:50:53.100]   It's great.
[01:50:53.100 --> 01:50:54.780]   I want to encourage more of that soft part.
[01:50:54.780 --> 01:50:57.860]   If you had DJ Pro for the iPad, is it the same?
[01:50:57.860 --> 01:50:58.660]   Or this is--
[01:50:58.660 --> 01:50:59.660]   No, so this is--
[01:50:59.660 --> 01:51:00.940]   So DJ Pro is a new app.
[01:51:00.940 --> 01:51:02.740]   Like I still have DJ for the iPad.
[01:51:02.740 --> 01:51:03.940]   I still have DJ for the iPhone.
[01:51:03.940 --> 01:51:05.740]   I think DJ for the iPhone is free, if not close,
[01:51:05.740 --> 01:51:06.420]   to free right now.
[01:51:06.420 --> 01:51:09.300]   It's sort of like a celebration of this launch.
[01:51:09.300 --> 01:51:13.460]   But this is as fully featured as the Mac app, if not more.
[01:51:13.460 --> 01:51:14.180]   Nice.
[01:51:14.180 --> 01:51:15.780]   Wow.
[01:51:15.780 --> 01:51:19.100]   I really hope to see more apps like this for the Mac Pro.
[01:51:19.100 --> 01:51:20.260]   Because that's really--
[01:51:20.260 --> 01:51:22.660]   This is what it's-- and if you're a DJ having that--
[01:51:22.660 --> 01:51:24.700]   all that screen-- I mean, this is just great.
[01:51:24.700 --> 01:51:27.140]   And all the storage.
[01:51:27.140 --> 01:51:32.820]   Mr. Jim Dau Rimple, have you a-- have a VAWA pick for us?
[01:51:32.820 --> 01:51:34.500]   I do, but it's not a Christmas pick.
[01:51:34.500 --> 01:51:35.740]   I don't like Christmas songs.
[01:51:35.740 --> 01:51:36.740]   OK.
[01:51:36.740 --> 01:51:37.780]   Right on.
[01:51:37.780 --> 01:51:40.900]   I don't care about metal bands singing Christmas songs.
[01:51:40.900 --> 01:51:43.740]   You'd like the celebrity skin version of Carol the Bells.
[01:51:43.740 --> 01:51:44.940]   I know you would.
[01:51:44.940 --> 01:51:48.300]   I've got an older band pick today.
[01:51:48.300 --> 01:51:49.820]   OK.
[01:51:49.820 --> 01:51:53.620]   Very good hard rock.
[01:51:53.620 --> 01:51:57.260]   It's a band called King's X.
[01:51:57.260 --> 01:52:00.460]   And the album specifically that I want to recommend
[01:52:00.460 --> 01:52:03.020]   is called Dogman.
[01:52:03.020 --> 01:52:07.780]   And it was put out in 1993, this album.
[01:52:07.780 --> 01:52:12.100]   And the first song, Dogman, is just incredible.
[01:52:12.100 --> 01:52:14.020]   It's a great band, great album.
[01:52:14.020 --> 01:52:17.980]   I think a lot of people, based on the feedback I get
[01:52:17.980 --> 01:52:20.700]   from recommending things like Blackstone Cherry.
[01:52:23.180 --> 01:52:26.020]   I think a lot of people really like this.
[01:52:26.020 --> 01:52:27.620]   It's great.
[01:52:27.620 --> 01:52:31.220]   It is not on Spotify, but it is on--
[01:52:31.220 --> 01:52:32.860]   looks like YouTube.
[01:52:32.860 --> 01:52:34.460]   And I see it on Google Play Music.
[01:52:34.460 --> 01:52:37.460]   That sounds good.
[01:52:37.460 --> 01:52:41.340]   I like it.
[01:52:41.340 --> 01:52:47.380]   Which album did you recommend?
[01:52:47.380 --> 01:52:48.140]   Dogman.
[01:52:48.140 --> 01:52:49.140]   Dogman.
[01:52:49.140 --> 01:52:50.460]   $9.49.
[01:52:50.460 --> 01:52:51.780]   I'm the Google Play Store.
[01:52:51.780 --> 01:52:54.660]   I wonder if I have the closet on the edge of the store.
[01:52:54.660 --> 01:52:56.780]   Very nice.
[01:52:56.780 --> 01:53:01.500]   Jim Dowlrimple is at the loop, loopinsight.com
[01:53:01.500 --> 01:53:04.540]   at J. Dowlrimple on the Twitter.
[01:53:04.540 --> 01:53:08.980]   Hey, I meant to ask you, anything you've heard about that March
[01:53:08.980 --> 01:53:12.060]   rumored, Mark Gurman's rumored March Apple event,
[01:53:12.060 --> 01:53:14.900]   any confirmation or anything you've heard about it?
[01:53:14.900 --> 01:53:18.460]   There's all kinds of rumors going around.
[01:53:18.460 --> 01:53:20.020]   You can never tell what's happening.
[01:53:20.020 --> 01:53:21.460]   All right.
[01:53:21.460 --> 01:53:22.340]   Nothing to say here.
[01:53:22.340 --> 01:53:23.180]   Nothing to see here.
[01:53:23.180 --> 01:53:25.220]   Move along.
[01:53:25.220 --> 01:53:26.580]   Renee Ritchie.
[01:53:26.580 --> 01:53:28.420]   He is at imore.com.
[01:53:28.420 --> 01:53:31.300]   Great place to go to get your not only great text,
[01:53:31.300 --> 01:53:34.020]   but great podcasts.
[01:53:34.020 --> 01:53:36.340]   Anything you want to plug?
[01:53:36.340 --> 01:53:38.740]   We've got another episode of Deebok going up later tonight
[01:53:38.740 --> 01:53:41.540]   or tomorrow with Don Melton and Nitin Gennatra
[01:53:41.540 --> 01:53:45.140]   our back talking about how you manage teams at Apple,
[01:53:45.140 --> 01:53:47.540]   which I thought was very interesting.
[01:53:47.540 --> 01:53:49.740]   Yeah, but that's interesting.
[01:53:49.740 --> 01:53:50.620]   Thank you, Renee.
[01:53:50.620 --> 01:53:52.380]   Great to see you.
[01:53:52.380 --> 01:53:55.540]   I like your shelf decoration, as always.
[01:53:55.540 --> 01:53:57.340]   I have a Lego Leo.
[01:53:57.340 --> 01:53:58.180]   Is that Lego?
[01:53:58.180 --> 01:53:59.020]   I don't know what that's Lego.
[01:53:59.020 --> 01:53:59.940]   I don't know what it is.
[01:53:59.940 --> 01:54:00.260]   Looks like--
[01:54:00.260 --> 01:54:00.780]   Oh, my god.
[01:54:00.780 --> 01:54:01.780]   Hold them up.
[01:54:01.780 --> 01:54:03.220]   That was a good thing.
[01:54:03.220 --> 01:54:04.140]   Which way?
[01:54:04.140 --> 01:54:05.540]   It's not coordinated this way.
[01:54:05.540 --> 01:54:05.940]   There we go.
[01:54:05.940 --> 01:54:09.140]   It's an elf on the shelf.
[01:54:09.140 --> 01:54:12.140]   And also, Andy, not go from the Chicago Sun times
[01:54:12.140 --> 01:54:16.700]   and wearing a very sporty little chapel to a chapel
[01:54:16.700 --> 01:54:19.020]   from Fezal Rama.
[01:54:19.020 --> 01:54:20.100]   Great to see you.
[01:54:20.100 --> 01:54:23.260]   I lead not through cruelty but through justice.
[01:54:23.260 --> 01:54:25.900]   Is it snowing in Boston yet?
[01:54:25.900 --> 01:54:26.700]   Hell no.
[01:54:26.700 --> 01:54:30.340]   I've actually got that big window open, that big window open,
[01:54:30.340 --> 01:54:33.820]   and the door open because it's so--
[01:54:33.820 --> 01:54:37.620]   It's not like in the '80s, but it's like in the high '50s.
[01:54:37.620 --> 01:54:41.740]   And it's like I just needed to cool down the house.
[01:54:41.740 --> 01:54:45.300]   I'm just saying that your children will all be OK,
[01:54:45.300 --> 01:54:47.100]   but your children will be definitely
[01:54:47.100 --> 01:54:49.540]   teaching your grandchildren how to kill people
[01:54:49.540 --> 01:54:50.580]   for gasoline.
[01:54:50.580 --> 01:54:51.580]   That's what's going to happen.
[01:54:51.580 --> 01:54:55.860]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:54:55.860 --> 01:54:56.980]   It's fun to do this show.
[01:54:56.980 --> 01:54:57.940]   I love you guys.
[01:54:57.940 --> 01:55:01.140]   If you want to join us live, you can watch it every Tuesday,
[01:55:01.140 --> 01:55:06.980]   11 AM Pacific, 2 PM Eastern time, 1900 UTC on live.twit.tv.
[01:55:06.980 --> 01:55:09.780]   You could be in the chatroom at IRC.twit.tv.
[01:55:09.780 --> 01:55:14.100]   Participate or get it after the fact.
[01:55:14.100 --> 01:55:17.500]   Audio and video available at twit.tv/mbw for Mac,
[01:55:17.500 --> 01:55:19.380]   right weekly.
[01:55:19.380 --> 01:55:21.020]   Podcast apps everywhere.
[01:55:21.020 --> 01:55:22.020]   Have it.
[01:55:22.020 --> 01:55:25.940]   Apple TV, there's now four Twit apps on the Apple TV store.
[01:55:25.940 --> 01:55:28.420]   You can watch us and or download us there.
[01:55:28.420 --> 01:55:30.340]   It's all free.
[01:55:30.340 --> 01:55:31.420]   Not the apps, but us.
[01:55:31.420 --> 01:55:33.140]   We're cheap.
[01:55:33.140 --> 01:55:33.780]   The apps are cheap.
[01:55:33.780 --> 01:55:35.100]   We're free.
[01:55:35.100 --> 01:55:37.060]   And I thank you for joining us.
[01:55:37.060 --> 01:55:39.740]   We're doing-- how's the best of coming along there?
[01:55:39.740 --> 01:55:41.740]   Should we get some more submissions, Jason Elle?
[01:55:41.740 --> 01:55:44.420]   I would always love to get more submissions.
[01:55:44.420 --> 01:55:47.340]   Twit.tv/bestof, help me out.
[01:55:47.340 --> 01:55:48.100]   Yeah.
[01:55:48.100 --> 01:55:48.740]   Please.
[01:55:48.740 --> 01:55:49.500]   Yeah.
[01:55:49.500 --> 01:55:51.980]   A lot of work putting those together.
[01:55:51.980 --> 01:55:53.100]   I've got help, thankfully.
[01:55:53.100 --> 01:55:55.100]   I don't know how I'd get it all done if I didn't have help.
[01:55:55.100 --> 01:56:00.500]   We will be here next week on the 22nd as we approach
[01:56:00.500 --> 01:56:03.380]   the holiday of Christmas, which I know
[01:56:03.380 --> 01:56:05.900]   is celebrated in many lands.
[01:56:05.900 --> 01:56:09.100]   But we will not be here the following December 29th.
[01:56:09.100 --> 01:56:11.060]   That will be the best of.
[01:56:11.060 --> 01:56:13.020]   So, twit.tv/bestof.
[01:56:13.020 --> 01:56:14.260]   Oh, you know what?
[01:56:14.260 --> 01:56:18.060]   You got to have in there from 2015, this or that, whatever.
[01:56:18.060 --> 01:56:19.780]   We'd love that help.
[01:56:19.780 --> 01:56:20.580]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:56:20.580 --> 01:56:21.700]   Get back to work.
[01:56:21.700 --> 01:56:23.220]   Break time is over.
[01:56:23.220 --> 01:56:26.180]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:56:26.180 --> 01:56:29.540]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:56:29.540 --> 01:56:32.120]   (upbeat music)
[01:56:32.120 --> 01:56:34.700]   (upbeat music)
