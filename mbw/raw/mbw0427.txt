[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.200]   Andy Inako has the day off. Wow, he hasn't he hasn't not been here in ages but fortunately
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:52.200]   Alex Lindsey is here from DC, the nation's capital. How's it going? It's going well. I see
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.200]   you I see you've got the crane up and you're starting to rebuild the capital. We're building
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.200]   the new that's the new office actually. So we thought it would be really great if it was
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.200]   right next to the camera. Right there. Right there. Right there. Right there. Right
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:10.200]   to see you Alex and it's fitting because it's an election day in the US. So I'm feeling very
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.200]   patriotic. I'm here in DC. Do you see them now? Watch their setting up for their coverage
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.200]   tonight and all that. Yeah, so we're the the office that I'm in is actually Eurovision
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:27.200]   which is all the European TV networks are all all right here like on this floor. So the
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.200]   DC is up on the fourth floor I think or fifth floor and so it is mass chaos here. This is
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.200]   the one safe room that isn't being used up in the whole the whole building right now.
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.200]   It's a big day. Yeah. Also with us from Montreal where they are not voting today but we'll be
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:48.200]   voting several times in the next few weeks. Renee Richie, if I'm more.com. Hi Renee.
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.200]   Alex looks so good it feels like we're all in his studio. Yeah, you know I think Alex
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:58.200]   is sucking all the bandwidth out of this show. I think so. It's all going downhill. Anyway
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:05.200]   great to have you Renee. Thank you. We are going to talk about Apple's annual report which
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:11.200]   came out just right after our show unfortunately. Did it or did it not come out right after
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.200]   our show came out Tuesday at 3.46 a.m. I guess we had I guess we talked about it a little
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:23.200]   bit last week. In fact we did. So forget it. Nothing to say here moving on. Starwood
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.200]   Hotels is going to let you this is good for you. You you big travelers and both of you
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.200]   I know travel quite a bit. I can't wait. You're going to be able to use your iPhone or your
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:39.200]   Apple Watch should you get one to open the door. In fact. You won't even have to go to
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.200]   the front desk. Oh that's so awesome. And it will tell you what the room is. You know I
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.200]   stay in a lot of different rooms and one of my big my big challenges is remembering every
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.200]   night which room I'm in. I used to be really good at it. I used to have like a really good
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.200]   short term memory where I could remember where that was and now I get there and I'm like
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.200]   I think that was last night's room and this room is something different. I can only imagine.
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.200]   And so having it on my iPhone and being able to just say you're in 3.18 and walk up to
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:10.200]   the room and click it would be awesome. They should give you walk in directions. Turn left at the
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:17.200]   back. I beacons. I beacons. This way Alex. You're bed. You're heavenly bed awaits. So it's
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.200]   not all the Starwood property. Starwood is a lot. I think Sheraton is Starwood, Westin
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:27.200]   is Starwood. It's going to be at the W which is a fancy Western. So fancy. They don't need
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:34.200]   the Esten. The element. I don't know what the element is and aloft. Aloft is kind of their
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:44.200]   hip. They're hip hotels that are usually they took over something that was not as high end.
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:49.200]   It's like a boutique. It's a little bit more boutique but really driven towards business
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.200]   travelers and so on and so forth. They're cool. There's nothing about them that are really
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:57.200]   snazzy. It doesn't feel like big things but they figured out what all the amenities that
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.200]   most of us want that are traveling all the time and so it works out well.
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:07.200]   There's one right across from Cupertino. Which I'm sure is like $1,000 a month. The entire
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.200]   South Bay is super expensive and then the weekend is cheap. The Vero wanted vacation.
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.200]   The South Bay and Cupertino and Mountain View. That's a place to go over the weekend because
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:20.200]   like $10 a night. But the hotel eight is like $300 a night during the week.
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:25.200]   It's like where I used to stay in Toronto. The Drake where it was an old flop house. It was
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.200]   on Queen Street. It was at the very end of Queen Street. It used to be like where bums lived.
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.200]   And then they fixed it up and started charging $1,000 a night.
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:38.200]   Exactly. Do you remember that Alex? We did a show on the roof. It was really swanky.
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:45.200]   They just made it all look shiny. Is it Jhurudeviv? Hotels that are in all over San Francisco
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:51.200]   are kind of like that. But not quite as nice. The Drake was much nicer. That was a great
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.200]   trailer. That was a great... The Shrager does these things.
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.200]   I can't remember what we did. We were on the roof. We did one show. Might have been this
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.200]   show. I can't remember. But we were up on the roof. I think it was Twit on the roof.
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:05.200]   It's like, you know... I also remember that hotel for its restaurant where they showed
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:10.200]   in a loop old computer chronicles episodes. Right. And I remember sitting there with
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:15.200]   Amber saying someday we'll be on that wall. You probably were for exactly.
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:21.200]   I think we are. There's the old call for help episodes. Anyway, sorry. I got distracted.
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:26.200]   So here's how this will work. And it's going to be soon after booking a reservation at
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:34.200]   a keyless hotel. You have to be an SPG member, Starward Preferred member. You'll be
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:39.200]   invited to opt in to keyless and then you'll register your phone. You'll have to have
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:45.200]   the Starward app on there. Approximately 24 hours before arrival. Alex will receive
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:50.200]   his or her room number, giving him time to memorize it, and a Bluetooth key.
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:57.200]   via the app. I guess that'll just be... I don't know what. A Bluetooth.
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.200]   Probably some sort of token that lasts for as long as your reservation lasts.
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:06.200]   Clever. Upon arrival at the hotel, you can completely bypass the front desk where
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:12.200]   available. Just walk to your room. Where there's no front desk available, you still have
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:19.200]   to bypass it. And go directly to your room. Then, after ensuring your Bluetooth is enabled,
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:24.200]   the desk simply opens. This has as bad as currency. Opens the SPG app. Taps the
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:30.200]   smartphone on the door lock. Wait for the green light. It just depends on how quickly
[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:35.200]   that order is required. You know that. It might be a video unless you're sitting there
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:39.200]   waiting. I think it probably has a better chance than some of the keys that we use now.
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:45.200]   You get these keys. You have to do it like six times to try to. It'd be so cool if you could use touch ID.
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:51.200]   Just tap it. Then, no one could get in your room. And they have NFC. I mean, here in
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:55.200]   DC, they have NFC hotels with Meridian and a couple other ones where you just take your
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:59.200]   card and you don't slide anywhere. I prefer that. Yeah, in London, when we stayed in London,
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:04.200]   they had that. I prefer that because the Mag Strips gets demagneted, demagnetized right
[00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:15.200]   away. Yes. Aloft is in Harlem. Cupertino, Beijing, Cancun, downtown New York. That's
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:20.200]   probably, you know, that's south of how. The usual Honsley Hollywood. Hollywood. Oh, the W Hollywood.
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:25.200]   I've stayed there. That's actually good. That's a fun hotel. Looks like you, the place they
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:33.200]   put make porn movies. W Singapore, W Hong Kong, W Doha and Element Times Square. Sounds
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:38.200]   nice. There's some people who are worried about security for this kind of stuff, but it doesn't
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:42.200]   seem any less secure than just trying to carry around a card with you. And if you go in and
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:47.200]   lock the door and put the bolt on the door, you'll be as safe as anything. Yeah, I mean,
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:50.200]   you kind of, when you hear this kind of thing, you say, well, I wonder how long that's before
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:54.200]   that's hacked. But they all get hacked. Yeah. And, you know, and there's their, their
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:59.200]   their user act and the security guys all have your, your, it's can get all good into your car.
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:03.200]   And the other guys that work maintenance and the, and the people who are cleaning your room.
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:08.200]   I mean, you know, hotels are not the most secure locations in the world. Yeah.
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:12.200]   You kind of keep that in the back of your head. So you do tap the smartphone on the door
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:17.200]   lock, but I guess because it's Bluetooth or is it using NFC? Because Apple doesn't, Apple,
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:22.200]   doesn't Apple lock down NFC to pay? Yeah. The NFC is currently only available to Apple.
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:28.200]   So pay using NFC. It's probably using BT four point BTLE. BTLE. Yeah, it says based on
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.200]   Bluetooth,
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:35.200]   not NFC. It'll work with all iPhones from the four S onward. That's the good news because
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:39.200]   if we're NFC would only work with the six. And of course, you'll have the option of a
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:45.200]   physical key. In case your iPhone battery doesn't know, that's a good point. I can't
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:51.200]   get in my room. My iPhone battery is dead. I actually would have that problem often.
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:55.200]   Yeah. By the time you check it out, a lot less with new one. This makes it, then I had this
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:10:00.200]   one. This makes it look fun. Here's the ad from SPG. Is this it?
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:15.200]   Even a dog to get into your room. I want that to taste.
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:20.200]   You better. And if you're, oh, this happens to me all the time. My arms are full with
[00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:27.200]   dropping bags. But now I can just wave my phone. Who's this? Oh, this is, this is from
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:31.200]   the shining. That's the kid going down the line. Oh my God, it's the shining. Watch out.
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:38.200]   Don't open this door. That's kind of cool that they have that little. I like this. They're
[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:42.200]   playing to the hip crowd, right? Sorry, but I lost my phone in my room and I can't get in
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:43.200]   here.
[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:51.200]   I get in here. He's the cool guy. They're the band. Yeah, that's the manager, the road manager,
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:57.200]   obviously. And then who's this? Oh, Miley Cyrus is there. Wow, this is a very hip ad.
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:04.200]   Open up and cross check. Oh, this is funny.
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:15.200]   Yeah, that's what is the sport. What I'm really amazed at is the hell.
[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:18.200]   We've got children present. We're going to close that.
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:24.200]   Well, what I'm amazed at is just being able to open your door has opened up all these other
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:27.200]   possibilities of fun at a hotel that just didn't exist. I mean, I think it's quite amazing.
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:34.200]   I have never had that much fun in my life. Wow. And it's awesome.
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:38.200]   And just because of the last, you don't even need to be curious about it.
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:44.200]   All right. So that's cool. They say it'll be in 150 hotels by the end of next year.
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:46.200]   It's just rolling out in these few at first.
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:52.200]   If I have an Android phone or they're discriminating against me.
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:56.200]   You have Bluetooth on the Android phone. They just need to make an app.
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:12:00.200]   I bet they, they're not pushing this.
[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:07.200]   By the way, the law, a loft in Silicon Valley, Jeff is reminding us is one with the robot that brings you stuff.
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:13.200]   They never mentioned that much lately. Oh, idea. I had no idea. There was a, there was a hotel with a robot
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:15.200]   that brings you stuff. A loft, Cupertino.
[00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.200]   Yeah.
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:20.200]   So you say, I need a toothbrush. I forgot mine.
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:24.200]   They take a $50,000 robot. They put a toothbrush on his head.
[00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:30.200]   And then I have to admit, I would feel a lot, I wouldn't feel as bad about asking for a tooth, a toothbrush.
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:36.200]   If, if I robot brought it, I always feel bad when some dude comes up and brings me a toothbrush.
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:39.200]   But you don't mind bothering a robot.
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:43.200]   No, no, I don't mind bothering a robot at all. In fact, I might better things.
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.200]   Explain about it being late.
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:54.200]   Disney, now Bonnie World is absolutely right in the chatroom. She's pointing out that Disney World has those magic bands with RFID
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:13:00.200]   and you don't have to open an app. You just go, it would be, you know, I think a key with RFID is actually a little bit easier.
[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:04.200]   But this has a cool factor, right?
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:11.200]   We do not think that the Apple Watch is going to be out before Chinese New Year.
[00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:18.200]   That was the thinking Ben Thompson of Stratecary on Twit last week said, I think, you know, he's in Taiwan, so he's very tuned into this.
[00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:26.200]   Given the size and port of the Chinese market, that Apple will announce the eye watch right before the February 19th Chinese New Year.
[00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:29.200]   Because that would be a very popular gift in China.
[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:36.200]   Remember that the Apple Watch showed up in China Vogue, its first appearance.
[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:46.200]   But Apple's retail senior vice president Angela Arendtz has apparently sent a video to the crew saying it's going to be a busy, busy time.
[00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:51.200]   No, this is, we're in a sprint. We are sprinting a marathon.
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:55.200]   Going into the holidays, we'll go into Chinese New Year.
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:02.200]   And then we've got a new watch launch coming in the spring.
[00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:06.200]   It's a pep talk she was giving, but that is a little bit of a leak.
[00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:11.200]   I know you've got your finger on the pulse of the Apple rumor mill. Mark Griman had this.
[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:13.200]   What do you think, Renee Richie?
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:15.200]   When are we?
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:16.200]   I thought I was always going to be spring.
[00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:18.200]   I didn't know that was really up for debate.
[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:23.200]   Apple has fairly set schedules even when they've announced things in January.
[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:28.200]   They've shipped in March or April and this always appeared like a spring launch.
[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:33.200]   Chinese New Year is more important in terms of manufacturing because they get holidays and then the factory is shut down.
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:34.200]   Just I believe they do.
[00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:42.200]   So they probably wouldn't try to do anything over that period, which means there's usually a healthy distance between Chinese New Year and when products are released.
[00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:47.200]   But it's also unsure whether this will be an international launch where the iPad, you know, for the iPhone, those both debuted in the next year.
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:51.200]   It took a couple of months for them to go international after that.
[00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:54.200]   There's no indication that the Apple watch will be any different.
[00:14:54.200 --> 00:15:01.200]   I mean, I believe on the US website, it says coming early 2015 and everywhere else just says coming 2015.
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:03.200]   What does early mean to you though?
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:05.200]   What is the spring?
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:06.200]   First quarter.
[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:10.200]   January, February, March, April, May.
[00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:12.200]   First or second quarter, March or April?
[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:15.200]   Again, that's when the iPad launched and when the Apple TV launched.
[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:18.200]   It's just the room more recent version of the Apple TV.
[00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:23.200]   That's just Apple tends to do things according to, they're not predictable, but they do follow patterns.
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:25.200]   Plus it's time.
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:26.200]   I mean, why put it out in January?
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:30.200]   If no one's going to expect it, everyone will just spend their money for the holidays.
[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:31.200]   Take the time.
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:33.200]   You know, use as much time as you can to get it as good as you can.
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:36.200]   The analysts say, look, you already missed the Christmas season.
[00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:38.200]   So it doesn't really, after that, it doesn't matter.
[00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:44.200]   But when you liked, normally the first three months of the year are the slowest time for Apple.
[00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:47.200]   Wouldn't you love to have a product in January, February, or March?
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:52.200]   Even if it's just the last few weeks of March, so you could kind of boost up revenues for that quarter?
[00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:54.200]   Yeah, last few weeks of March makes a lot of sense.
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:55.200]   Again, that's when the iPad debuted.
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.200]   But also we don't know how many they're going to be able to make it first.
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:03.200]   And if you put it out during a high volume quarter like Christmas or Chinese New Year, if you're going to launch in China,
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:04.200]   you have to be able to supply all of those.
[00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:09.200]   And Apple has been constrained before with Rhett and then we don't know what the constraints will be with the watch, if any.
[00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:10.200]   With iPhone 6 was constrained.
[00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:12.200]   iPhone 6 plus very constrained.
[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:15.200]   So I think the spring is when they launch these new things for a reason.
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:22.200]   I think it lets them get enough space after the holidays, but they don't have to meet crazy amounts of demand.
[00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:24.200]   And it's just a good quarter to launch things in.
[00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:30.200]   And there were rumors, I don't know how credible that there are supplies, minor, I think they said supply issues.
[00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:31.200]   I don't know what parts they're.
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:34.200]   All the time, they're Apple announced the product and then they're constrained.
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:37.200]   They're not going to make the deadline and then they launch anyway.
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:40.200]   And I know it's just kind of boilerplate, right?
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:45.200]   And one of the reasons that they have so much trouble with supply issues, a lot of people will say,
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:47.200]   "Why doesn't Apple just sort this out?"
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:50.200]   They should just be able to make one of the biggest companies out there.
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:54.200]   But the thing to understand is that the way they make everything is the hardest way possible.
[00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:56.200]   Not because they do a lot of things.
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:58.200]   What makes it so hard?
[00:16:58.200 --> 00:16:59.200]   What's what do they do?
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:04.200]   So they make decisions about, for instance, when they first came out, I think I mentioned this in another show,
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:07.200]   but when they first came out with the trackpad for the Macs,
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:11.200]   they decided that they really wanted to be a certain way and it wouldn't have the buttons
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:14.200]   and have a certain surface to it and the failure rate on that was,
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:18.200]   and this is something we don't usually calculate into the cost of the product when we think of margins and everything else,
[00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:21.200]   is the failure of the trackpad was 40%.
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:22.200]   That was the rumor.
[00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:25.200]   So 40% of the ones they were making weren't working.
[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:30.200]   And when you look at the fit and finish of a lot of the products that Apple makes,
[00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:35.200]   they do things that are very difficult, whether it's thinness, the way that the glass bevels,
[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:39.200]   the way everything fits together and the fact that everything fits perfectly together
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:45.200]   and the QA is really high also means that a lot don't come out the other end.
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:52.200]   They literally may get a lot made and then some certain percentage, especially at the beginning,
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:56.200]   while they're still sorting out mass production, because you really can't know what the problems are going to be meant
[00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:58.200]   with mass production until you're doing it.
[00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:02.200]   I'm sure that they've sorted out most of those issues, but I think that makes it very difficult.
[00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:05.200]   And the watch is packing a lot into a very small piece.
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:09.200]   So I imagine there's going to be a lot of issues when they get started on.
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:11.200]   Of course, when you have a new category, you don't know how well it's going to sell.
[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:16.200]   And you can't, I don't think you can assume the Apple watch is going to sell at the same clip as the iPhone,
[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:17.200]   or even an iPad.
[00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:20.200]   Well, nothing's going to sell the same clip as the iPhone.
[00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:21.200]   That's that classic thing, right?
[00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:24.200]   The iPhone is the most valuable consumer electronics business ever.
[00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:26.200]   The iPad doesn't sell as well as that.
[00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:27.200]   Nothing else does.
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:30.200]   So the question is really, is it going to sell probably better than an Apple TV,
[00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:34.200]   maybe not as well as an iPad, and where does it fall in those range between the two?
[00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:38.200]   Is it more like a hobby or is it more like a tertiary device?
[00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:39.200]   What is it?
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:43.200]   That's actually a greater question, more interesting, frankly, than the rumor question,
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:45.200]   because who cares, all these rumors?
[00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:49.200]   And as somebody that Charon pointed out, even the idea that would ship by Valentine's Day
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:53.200]   or by Chinese New Year is merely something analysts made up.
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:56.200]   He said, I like the quote.
[00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:59.200]   Let me give him credit.
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:05.200]   Analysts are the only people who can be 100% wrong, 100% of the time and still have a job.
[00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:08.200]   Analysts and weathermen and weathermen.
[00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:13.200]   So, yeah, here's a larger issue.
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:18.200]   And maybe a more interesting issue is how Apple sees this watch.
[00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:19.200]   Is it seen as a...
[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:23.200]   Do they wait, for instance, to say the Apple TV is a hobby and wait and see how it sells,
[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:28.200]   or do they kind of say, you know, we know this isn't a front-line product for us.
[00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:33.200]   But it's something we'd like to... A category we're interested in, what do you think?
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:35.200]   I think they're going to go full-bore on it.
[00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:37.200]   I think that they spent a lot of money on design.
[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:40.200]   I think they've spent a lot of money on PR.
[00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:44.200]   I think that they've waited and probably put this announcement off quite a few times.
[00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:47.200]   I think that this is... I think they definitely see this as a large category.
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:48.200]   A lot of people see it as a large category.
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:53.200]   I think that watches and wearables are probably one of the biggest things we see at CES in January.
[00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:57.200]   So, I think that, you know, figuring out ways to have us be able to do a lot of those things.
[00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:00.200]   And I think that it completes a lot of things that the iPhone starts, you know,
[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:04.200]   when it comes to making payments, when it comes to going into your hotel room,
[00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:08.200]   using it for getting through security on your door, you know, at an office.
[00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:12.200]   All of those things are great with a phone and much better with a watch.
[00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:18.200]   I have to say, I'm a little more convinced to the category having worn the Moto 360 now for about six weeks.
[00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:22.200]   I actually... I do use it, and I would miss it if it weren't on my wrist.
[00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:26.200]   I mean, it's a lot of time where one too, right? You agree? You feel a... Jason Howles.
[00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:30.200]   Yeah. I mean, I completely agree.
[00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:33.200]   There have been a couple of days where I've accidentally not charged it,
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.200]   and I authentically miss it the next day.
[00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:38.200]   Yeah. Yeah. Which is kind of weird because, right, like, what are we using it for?
[00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:40.200]   Everyone's doing it a while. I look at it for the time.
[00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:46.200]   But I think what it is is siphoning off the important notifications that wake you up.
[00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:49.200]   You know what I mean? Otherwise, it's just this phone that's in your pocket,
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:53.200]   and you almost like continue to ignore it because it goes off,
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:58.200]   or you're just so used to it being there and going off and just ignoring it.
[00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:00.200]   If it's on your wrist and you've set it up properly,
[00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:02.200]   and I'm sure the Apple Watch is going to do the same thing,
[00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:05.200]   then those notifications actually become very useful.
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:12.200]   Actually, that's actually a big point, which is that it takes you a while to kind of configure it...
[00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:16.200]   Yes. ...to make it useful. So out of the box, it may not be that useful.
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:19.200]   For instance, I think out of the box, all notifications come through,
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:21.200]   and you don't... Who cares about half of them.
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:24.200]   But if you configure it so that the really important stuff is that you're notified about,
[00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:26.200]   I think it actually could be very useful.
[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:28.200]   And it does the steps in the heart, right?
[00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:32.200]   It says, "Get up and get off your butt," and stuff like that. I think that's good.
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:36.200]   Yeah, but it's interesting because the Apple TV was cast as a hobby
[00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:39.200]   because of an entrenched media television sort of network
[00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:41.200]   that Apple was going to have a very hard time moving anywhere.
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:44.200]   So they always wanted to set expectations like we're feeling this area out,
[00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:47.200]   but because of cable companies, we're only going to be able to go so far.
[00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:50.200]   With the iPhone, almost everyone was moving to mobile phones.
[00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:53.200]   They just had to convert people from mobile phones to iPhones.
[00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:55.200]   And that's different than not everybody wears a watch.
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:58.200]   Not everybody wants a smart watch. A lot of people wear watches as jewelry
[00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:01.200]   or where Rolex is or Panorize or Omega is.
[00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:04.200]   So there's not this entrenched base of people who are going to naturally
[00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:08.200]   as part of the replacement cycle all move over to smart watches.
[00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:10.200]   So it's a little bit different. It's not quite the same as both.
[00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:14.200]   It might be more like the iPad where it's this extra thing that nobody really got right before,
[00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:17.200]   and there's a market for it. But it's not like the phone where you have to have it.
[00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:19.200]   It's sort of like, do you want this instead of a laptop?
[00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:23.200]   And it'll be a little bit more nuanced and a little bit less, a little bit more complicated.
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:25.200]   I do think notifications are interesting.
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:28.200]   I think for a lot of people, notifications start off being interesting
[00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:31.200]   and quickly become interruption. So you turn them on and you realize,
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:34.200]   "Oh, this is stopping me from living my life." And you turn them off again.
[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:37.200]   But the sort of passive modes where it is just logging things
[00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:40.200]   where notifications aren't really notifying you, but they're keeping track of things
[00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:43.200]   so when you want to go there, you can see them without pulling them off.
[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:45.200]   You can see them without pulling out your phone.
[00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:48.200]   It's sort of like this is a little shuttlecraft and your starship is your phone.
[00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:51.200]   And it's going to be dependent on that to begin with.
[00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:54.200]   The same way an iPhone was utterly dependent on a Mac or a PC to begin with.
[00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:56.200]   But over time, it'll get more and more independent,
[00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:59.200]   and then it'll be able to do all these sort of useful tasks,
[00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:01.200]   these passive tasks for us in the background.
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:03.200]   And it won't bother us. It won't disturb us. It won't take over our lives.
[00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:08.200]   But it'll just let us, you know, control our Apple TV or find out who the last person was who called us
[00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:11.200]   or see how many miles we watched, all of that when we want it to.
[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:14.200]   Not a hobby, in other words.
[00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:17.200]   I don't know. It'll make a lot more money than a hobby.
[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:20.200]   Yeah. I think it's a big category.
[00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:23.200]   I mean, I think a lot of people are trying to figure out what to do with their fitness bands
[00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:25.200]   and the fitness bands are trying to get to being a watch,
[00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:28.200]   but I think it's going to be hard because building the platformer,
[00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:31.200]   it's not going to like the iPhone and like the iPad.
[00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:35.200]   I mean, the iPhone started off as just being ahead because it was a really great interface,
[00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:38.200]   but really what made it as popular as it is is the platform, you know?
[00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:41.200]   And I think that, and of course the iPad was able to build on that,
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:43.200]   and I think that the platform is going to work.
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:48.200]   I think that it's going to be, you know, and I think that's going to be the hard part for the Fitbits
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:52.200]   and a variety of other ones that are trying to move into that is can they build a platform
[00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:54.200]   that's as compelling as what Apple's able to do.
[00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:57.200]   You saw the HP Chrono Wing.
[00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:02.200]   At least HP did one thing right. They got a designer, Michael Bestchan.
[00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:04.200]   I really want the computer to make it.
[00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:06.200]   I want the 3D computer. I don't know about the one.
[00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:09.200]   3D computer. I don't know that one.
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:13.200]   HP has, you know, came out with this computer that's a mixture of 2D and 3D.
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:15.200]   Don't forget it. You really want that?
[00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:17.200]   It's looking like a lot of fun.
[00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:18.200]   It was fun.
[00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:20.200]   I build those. I build those from scratch.
[00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:21.200]   I build stuff like that.
[00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:23.200]   Well, another 3D, but all these other things.
[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:26.200]   It's kind of like the postcard where it's looking at you or whatever.
[00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:28.200]   You don't want that.
[00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:29.200]   Trust me.
[00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:30.200]   So this is the...
[00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:32.200]   Apple is hiring apparently.
[00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:34.200]   Go ahead.
[00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:36.200]   Go ahead.
[00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:40.200]   So, see, Apple is apparently hiring a dedicated evangelist for WatchKit,
[00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:43.200]   like to just help developers get applications moved over to the Watch.
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:45.200]   Because it's not a one-to-one transport.
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:48.200]   You have to re-evaluate and reimagine your application for the Watch.
[00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:49.200]   And that'll be a big deal.
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:51.200]   You know, Twitter is a really great experience.
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:53.200]   If a bunch of the apps that you use every day and love on your phone
[00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:54.200]   are a really great experience,
[00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:56.200]   then that makes the Watch more valuable to you.
[00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:58.200]   That could be as much of a hold-up as anything else.
[00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:01.200]   You want it to launch with some useful stuff.
[00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:06.200]   So this is the Chrono Wing Smart Watch from HP.
[00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:08.200]   This is all LCD, by the way.
[00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:09.200]   There's no physical.
[00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:11.200]   But it does have a bunch of buttons.
[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:14.200]   No touchscreen, no microphone.
[00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:16.200]   Just a bunch of buttons.
[00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:19.200]   And apparently the Yankees beating the Red Sox,
[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:23.200]   I think HP doesn't understand that that is a loaded thing to say.
[00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:26.200]   7 to 2.
[00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:28.200]   9th inning.
[00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:33.200]   So this is a notification watch, not a health watch.
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:38.200]   I think everybody's doing it all out before Apple does.
[00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:40.200]   Because they know once Apple does it.
[00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:42.200]   Well, but I think the problem they have,
[00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:45.200]   and I think this is exactly why Apple made announcement,
[00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:47.200]   was Apple, all others, just a lot of people.
[00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:51.200]   I mean, Samsung talked about how their quarterly earnings were lower
[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:53.200]   because everyone was waiting for an iPhone.
[00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:57.200]   And in the same way, Apple really has kind of sandbag
[00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:58.200]   in the industry.
[00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:00.200]   Everyone's going to put out a whole bunch of ideas.
[00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:03.200]   But anybody who's really serious about this
[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:05.200]   is maybe not going to buy the Apple Watch,
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:07.200]   but they're not going to buy something else before it comes out.
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:08.200]   They're going to want to see it.
[00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:11.200]   So you were talking about the HP Sprout?
[00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:14.200]   Yeah.
[00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:15.200]   Okay.
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:17.200]   It's not exactly a 3D.
[00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:20.200]   It's a virtual reality, augmented reality computer.
[00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:23.200]   But it can scan, and then they have 3D printers coming out as well.
[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:24.200]   Right.
[00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:25.200]   You have a...
[00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:26.200]   So there's a lot of...
[00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:27.200]   Yeah.
[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:28.200]   I would want one of these.
[00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:29.200]   This is cool.
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:30.200]   See?
[00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:31.200]   Yeah, no, this is cool.
[00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:34.200]   And of course it'll be available sometime.
[00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:36.200]   Oh, it's next week.
[00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:37.200]   Yeah.
[00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:38.200]   You know what this looks like?
[00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:39.200]   You can get something like this for the iPad.
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:40.200]   It's really cool.
[00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:43.200]   What is the name of that little hood you put over your iPad camera,
[00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:46.200]   and then it has 70 bucks?
[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:47.200]   You've seen that.
[00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:49.200]   Your kids would love this.
[00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:51.200]   What's the name of a chatroom?
[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:53.200]   You know what I'm talking about?
[00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:56.200]   iPad hood.
[00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:59.200]   Well, it uses the camera.
[00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:05.200]   Oh, I'm never going to find it that way.
[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:06.200]   We should order one.
[00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:07.200]   It was a Kickstarter, I think.
[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:08.200]   And now it's out.
[00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:10.200]   And you have little actual real world blocks.
[00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:13.200]   The iPad camera can see them.
[00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:16.200]   And then you can do a tan gram, for instance.
[00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:19.200]   And it'll show it on the screen, and you try to match it, and it goes bing,
[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:20.200]   and you get it right.
[00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:22.200]   So they're already doing this on the iPad.
[00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:25.200]   It's kind of the mix of real world and digital world.
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:27.200]   I think with this PC, I think that will be interesting,
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:29.200]   is this is getting away.
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:30.200]   Finally, someone's doing something.
[00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:34.200]   I don't know if it's going to work or not, but someone's finally doing something
[00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:37.200]   that is different than keyboard and a mouse and everything else.
[00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:40.200]   They're going to experiment with it, and it gives them a little R&D,
[00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:41.200]   at least, to work with.
[00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:42.200]   Yeah.
[00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:43.200]   Here's the Osmo.
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:45.200]   This is actually really cool.
[00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:47.200]   It's available for 70 bucks.
[00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:49.200]   You play on the iPad with real people and real objects.
[00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:51.200]   They have several games.
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:53.200]   Let me make this full screen so you can see it.
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:28:00.200]   This little thing, all that really is the mirror that goes on your iPad's camera.
[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:02.200]   And now, so she's going to do the tan gram.
[00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:04.200]   So it puts a tan gram on the screen.
[00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:10.200]   She arranges it, and it kind of knows what she's doing, because it's got the camera.
[00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:13.200]   And then there's other ones for, like, have you seen this, Alex?
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:14.200]   I have seen it.
[00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:15.200]   It looks pretty cool.
[00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:18.200]   I think it's available now, 70 bucks.
[00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:22.200]   And they have a variety of little games besides that that you can do.
[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:26.200]   There's a word game.
[00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:28.200]   And this is cute.
[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:32.200]   They show little kids doing it.
[00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:34.200]   I want to get past the tan gram, though.
[00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:35.200]   There's the words, too.
[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:38.200]   Yeah, tan gram, I think the problem for me is that when I was in school,
[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:40.200]   that was kind of detention for me.
[00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:42.200]   So how about this?
[00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:45.200]   This one, you draw a picture, and it's a physics.
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:48.200]   You actually create a physics game with real markers.
[00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:49.200]   That's cool.
[00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:50.200]   Now, that's awesome, right?
[00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:51.200]   Yes.
[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:52.200]   Yes.
[00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:54.200]   I think this is really interesting.
[00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:56.200]   So HP's just stealing this copy.
[00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:57.200]   I'm sorry.
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:58.200]   Of course, they don't have a 3D print.
[00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:01.200]   Oh, look, the dinosaur becomes part of the game.
[00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:03.200]   You put a little rubber dinosaur on the piece of paper.
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:05.200]   See, I know, I like it.
[00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:06.200]   Now, how much would you pay?
[00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:07.200]   I'm going to order this.
[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:13.200]   Well, and whether it's this or Osmo, what's really interesting is this is being able to add,
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:17.200]   you know, using really this interface that can constantly be upgraded, can constantly
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:18.200]   be improved.
[00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:22.200]   So you just have to figure out how do we get it into that computer.
[00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:25.200]   And I think that we're going to see a lot of these things where we're trying to figure
[00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:28.200]   out how to just get stuff into the computer because then we're able to constantly improve
[00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:32.200]   it rather than constantly building hardware devices and shipping out different kinds
[00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:34.200]   of blocks to schools and everything else.
[00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:36.200]   A lot of it's going to come more and more virtual.
[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:38.200]   I'm excited about the iWatch.
[00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:39.200]   I'll buy one.
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:40.200]   I'm also skeptical.
[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:42.200]   I'm excited and skeptical.
[00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:43.200]   Which one, Leo?
[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:45.200]   Stainless steel aluminum rose gold.
[00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:46.200]   Oh, rose gold.
[00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:48.200]   No, of course not.
[00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:52.200]   But I don't want the, I don't want the sport one either.
[00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:56.200]   So I think the middle one, we don't, this, the least expensive already 350 bucks.
[00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:58.200]   We don't know what the middle one's going to be.
[00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:01.200]   What do you think the stainless steel one's going to be?
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:05.200]   Uh, closer to a thousand.
[00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:06.200]   Yeah.
[00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:07.200]   Shh.
[00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:09.200]   This, this habit of mine is very expensive.
[00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:11.200]   Very expensive habit.
[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:13.200]   It's for the listeners, Leo.
[00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:15.200]   I'm doing it for you.
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:16.200]   Yes.
[00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:18.200]   Just for you.
[00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:25.200]   According to other information, not, it's not a rumor, but they're telling the Apple, folks
[00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:29.600]   at the Apple store employees will get extra training to sell the watch and you will be
[00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:31.200]   able to try it on.
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:38.200]   It'll be more like going to a high end, a dress store and you'll get to, well, I don't
[00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:39.200]   know.
[00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:40.200]   What do you think?
[00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:44.680]   Does this watch make me look fat and try different bands, different accessories, different
[00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:45.680]   colors?
[00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:46.680]   Let go with my eyes.
[00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:47.680]   Let's go with mine.
[00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:50.080]   So no, they're pointing out that normally when you go to the Apple store, everything's
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:52.520]   tethered with a cable.
[00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:56.120]   But I don't know if this won't be, but I think it probably won't be if you're going to be
[00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:57.120]   able to try it on.
[00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:59.560]   It needs some interesting remodeling.
[00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:02.800]   Yeah, it's a whole new thing, isn't it?
[00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:03.800]   They're going to end up looking like Macy's.
[00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:09.120]   They're going to have glass cases, haughty people standing behind them, the watches in
[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:10.120]   their watch.
[00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:12.560]   Well, once you start charging those back kind of money for a watch, you really are buying
[00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:13.560]   your way into that.
[00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:14.560]   You have to.
[00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:15.560]   I mean, that's kind of part of the part of the thing.
[00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:18.280]   If someone's going to spend that kind of money, it's not something that's a well-known
[00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:21.520]   thing like a tablet or a phone or something like that.
[00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:25.840]   So you really have to, you're going to have to be able to put it on and take a look at
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:26.840]   it.
[00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:29.280]   I mean, I ordered everything online, so I don't need that.
[00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:31.480]   But I think a lot of people are going to want to.
[00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:36.120]   I remember, Lisa drags me into expensive jewelry stores.
[00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:37.840]   I remember going to a jewelry stores.
[00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:39.680]   It probably was in London.
[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:42.160]   And as she said, well, can I try that ring on?
[00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:44.360]   And the woman says, that ring?
[00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:45.360]   Yes.
[00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:47.640]   She has to get a key, get a manager.
[00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:49.080]   We get ushered into a separate room.
[00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:52.280]   They practically lock the door behind us for to try it on.
[00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:55.080]   I said, well, just, you know, out of curiosity, how much?
[00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:56.080]   $250,000.
[00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:59.280]   No wonder.
[00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:03.200]   But if you have a $10,000 watch, just going to like some Joe comes in with, you know, off
[00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:04.520]   the street and I go, well, try it on.
[00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:05.520]   See what you think.
[00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:07.440]   Go look at it in the sun.
[00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:08.920]   You can't do that, right?
[00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:11.520]   It's a different buying experience.
[00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:12.520]   It's a very different experience.
[00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:16.720]   So they're going to have to redo the stores and it'll be interesting to see what they
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:17.720]   do.
[00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:18.920]   All right, let's take a break.
[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:19.920]   We got a great one.
[00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:21.440]   I got a lot some more to talk about.
[00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:23.840]   And we got the best guys here in the business to do it.
[00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:24.840]   I miss Andy.
[00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:25.840]   We love Andy.
[00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:26.840]   Taking the week off.
[00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:32.760]   Richie from imore.com and the debug podcast, which is an awesome podcast and so much more.
[00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:34.760]   It's all at imore.com.
[00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:39.320]   Alex Lindsay, who has nothing to plug because he now works for the federal government in
[00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:44.680]   a secret role coming to you from undisclosed locations.
[00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:47.440]   Yeah, I can't figure out where the hell is he?
[00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:48.960]   See, I got, I even have the.
[00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:51.000]   Did you zoom in the Capitol building?
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.240]   Yeah, do that.
[00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:53.240]   Would you do that?
[00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:55.800]   I think you zoomed in the Capitol building.
[00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:56.800]   Are you?
[00:32:56.800 --> 00:33:01.000]   Then they move your little cube out farther on the.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.160]   Yeah, you know, it's out on the.
[00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:07.560]   You know, and, you know, it's, you know, it's, there is a place on that roof there because
[00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:08.560]   I've been there.
[00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:11.680]   Actually, you're now you're on a different one because that used to be the White House
[00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:12.680]   behind you.
[00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:13.680]   Yeah.
[00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:15.400]   Well, yeah, this is a different picture.
[00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:16.960]   So what?
[00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:17.960]   I know, I know.
[00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:18.960]   But it's one thing.
[00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:19.960]   Right.
[00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:20.960]   Go ahead.
[00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:21.960]   Exactly.
[00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:24.400]   It's, you know, well, the, you know, there's, there's feeds.
[00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:27.560]   Um, you know, in this building, there's feeds from all over the place.
[00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:29.800]   So, oh, so what else can you put you behind you?
[00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:30.800]   Can you put the White House?
[00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:34.200]   Can you be like, can you be like in the, in the press?
[00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:35.200]   Oh, I'll see.
[00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:36.200]   I'll see if I can get the.
[00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:37.200]   Okay.
[00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:39.200]   I'll do an ad while you figure out where else you could be.
[00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:44.440]   I showed it in ruchyway squarespace.com squarespace.
[00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:49.760]   The place to make your next website because Squarespace does it the way you would do it.
[00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:51.720]   If you thought about it, how could I do this?
[00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:53.600]   Well, I'd want to have the best hosting right.
[00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:54.600]   Whatever goes down, perfect stuff.
[00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:56.600]   Don't have to worry about security.
[00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:58.400]   You know, everything's managed for you.
[00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:01.160]   But you know, if I'm going to do that, I also want to be able to run the best software.
[00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:04.760]   I don't want to have to, you know, be a geek and install it and all and kind of, I want
[00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:08.360]   it to just be great software, great hosting kind of married to get.
[00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:09.800]   Oh, you're talking Squarespace.
[00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:16.080]   Now, would you perhaps want 24/7 support directly from the Squarespace offices, the developers,
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:17.080]   the people who do square.
[00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:18.400]   Yes, of course you would.
[00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:20.400]   And that's what you get with Squarespace.
[00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:25.840]   24/7 chat or email, you can, there also is a great self-help site because I know a lot
[00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:27.720]   of us can, I'm, oh, I just, I can figure it out.
[00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:29.240]   Just point me in the right direction.
[00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:34.400]   So they've got video workshops, a beautiful help portal.
[00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:36.280]   And you can do so much.
[00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:37.760]   They're constantly improving their platform.
[00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:40.600]   They just released Squarespace 7.
[00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:44.640]   Makes it even easier to get your unique website started.
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:48.840]   It's now all in, more all in one, more all inclusive, easier to navigate or navigate
[00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:51.480]   and operate in a seamless experience.
[00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:55.560]   For instance, Squarespace 7 allows you to live at it on one screen.
[00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:57.600]   You don't have to go back and forth to see the preview mode.
[00:34:57.600 --> 00:35:01.080]   You're actually working on the site directly, dragging and dropping.
[00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:02.080]   And that's the site.
[00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:04.480]   You can even preview the designs in device mode.
[00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:08.080]   So you, the nice thing about all Squarespace sites is that they work great on any size
[00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:09.080]   screen.
[00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:11.360]   So if you want, you could say, put this in device mode and you can see what it looked
[00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:14.680]   like on a tablet or on a mobile phone.
[00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:20.400]   Then access to professional stock photography from Getty as little as $10 per image for
[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:21.840]   your site.
[00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:24.680]   Instant branded email set up with Google Apps.
[00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:27.160]   So you're small, it's great for a small business.
[00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:30.120]   And you get that automatically when you sign up for Squarespace account.
[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:33.520]   And then templates that are designed for specific professions.
[00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:39.240]   So if you're a musician, if you're an artist, an architect, a chef, they've got a design
[00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:45.400]   category with templates designed for those industry groups, the new Horizon template,
[00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:47.680]   for instance, that's laid out for bands.
[00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:52.120]   So that it's already got a place for tour dates and a music player on it.
[00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:57.840]   So you could put your songs up there, a merch store, e-commerce on every template, by the
[00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:01.480]   way, and not just e-commerce, the best e-commerce anywhere.
[00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:02.480]   That's the horizon.
[00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:04.680]   Yeah, there it is.
[00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:07.240]   So this is for bands.
[00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:10.480]   And there's also a developer platform now out of beta.
[00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:16.920]   So you can, if you don't have to be a CSS or JavaScript or HTML guru, but if you are,
[00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:17.920]   you will love it.
[00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:21.800]   You'll be using the same platform Squarespace uses internally for its own site.
[00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:25.960]   So you have absolutely amazing control.
[00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:28.200]   Easy to use, easy to set up.
[00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:31.120]   You could try it free for two weeks, no credit card needed and it all starts.
[00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:32.920]   Look at that, look at that.
[00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:33.920]   $8 a month.
[00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:36.200]   You know, a lot of bands say, "I don't want you to look.
[00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:38.520]   You want a band site, but who's going to do it?"
[00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:39.520]   And we don't.
[00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:41.480]   And they can go, you can go to these very expensive labels.
[00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:42.840]   Have these very expensive solutions.
[00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:45.440]   No, go to Squarespace, $8 a month.
[00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:49.000]   And when you sign up for a year, that includes your domain name, Squarespace site, let's
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:50.920]   say you become the Beatles.
[00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:53.160]   It doesn't matter.
[00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:57.680]   Bandwidth is free and they can handle as much bandwidth as you can, as many users as you
[00:36:57.680 --> 00:36:59.880]   can throw at it.
[00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:03.720]   They've got great apps to portfolio, note, metric, blog.
[00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:08.680]   By the way, the Noten blog apps now on Android 2, which I am very happy about.
[00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:13.240]   Squarespace, to begin using Squarespace 7, existing customers, go to the Settings tab
[00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:15.200]   and you can activate all those new features.
[00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:16.760]   That's nice.

[00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:36.680]   So, Alex, where else can you be in the world?
[00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:37.680]   Alex, Lindsay?
[00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:38.680]   Everybody's busy.
[00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:41.680]   All the switches are busy right now because of the elections.
[00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:42.680]   Yes.
[00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:44.680]   So you're stuck in the cap.
[00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:45.680]   Stuck in the cap.
[00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:46.680]   Stuck in the cap.
[00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:47.680]   It's going to be hard.
[00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:50.680]   There's a lot of congestion here in DC due to the election.
[00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:57.680]   I just love Alex is like, it's like knowing a fantasy visit video wizard, like just some
[00:37:57.680 --> 00:37:58.680]   guy.
[00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:00.680]   And it's just always amazing to see what you're doing.
[00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:01.680]   You should wait.
[00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:05.680]   I've gotten very, Andy has the, he really got me thinking about that.
[00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:08.680]   Train camp 3,000, the future of video podcasting.
[00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:10.680]   I've been working on my own version of that.
[00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:12.680]   Oh, Andy's not going to be happy.
[00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:14.680]   Well, I'll send Andy one if he likes.
[00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:15.680]   I'll send Renee one.
[00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:18.680]   So right now it's a little bit of hardware.
[00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:21.680]   It's going to be like a jib and it's going to float.
[00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:22.680]   Yeah, something like that.
[00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:24.680]   Yes, steady cam for a mini cam.
[00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:25.680]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:29.680]   So you have to have gloves and virtual, you know, get an Oculus.
[00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:32.680]   I have an Office 365 subscription.
[00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:37.680]   I confess I use, you know, because some people need me to use Microsoft Office and it's cheap.
[00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:39.680]   It's like seven bucks a month.
[00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:46.680]   Plus, by the way, you get unlimited now unlimited one drive storage, not a terabyte, but unlimited.
[00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:51.680]   But I still can't, I should because I know people want to know I can't bring myself to download
[00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:52.680]   Outlook from the Mac.
[00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:55.680]   It's because you looked at it first.
[00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:56.680]   No, I hate Outlook.
[00:38:56.680 --> 00:38:57.680]   I hate it.
[00:38:57.680 --> 00:38:59.680]   What do you think?
[00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:05.680]   I have to admit that I'm on the verge of getting rid of all local mail apps.
[00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:09.680]   You know, I think that I work on different computers and the biggest, one of the biggest things
[00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:12.680]   I get concerned about when I think about losing my computer, like if I misplaced it or whatever,
[00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:13.680]   is all my email.
[00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:17.680]   And so, you know, part of me is just thinking I'd rather just log in and just get it all
[00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:18.680]   on the web.
[00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:23.680]   You know, once you get kind of used to that process, I think that it's actually a pretty
[00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:24.680]   doable thing.
[00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:28.680]   So, I'm kind of on, I haven't decided yet, the only problem I get into is when I'm on a
[00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:30.680]   plane, not being able to read my email.
[00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:35.680]   But outside of that, you know, now that most of these flights all have Wi-Fi anyway, I've
[00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:40.680]   been thinking of just ditching the whole, you know, email client altogether just to make
[00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:42.680]   sure that I can, you get it faster.
[00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:45.680]   I know if you're on Google Mail, you know, that a lot of times the delay between when
[00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:48.680]   you get it on the web and when you get it on an Apple Mail, for instance, can be minutes,
[00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:51.680]   which to me seems like an eternity sometimes.
[00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:53.680]   Someone will be on the phone saying, "I just sent it to you.
[00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:54.680]   I'm on the web.
[00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:55.680]   I can get it right then."
[00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:57.680]   Otherwise, I can kind of wait around until I'm out.
[00:39:57.680 --> 00:39:58.680]   People still need outlook though.
[00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:03.680]   There's some businesses, like Premiere Radio will send me a calendar, invites an outlook,
[00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:05.680]   and I say, "What do you think?
[00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:06.680]   Who uses this?
[00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:07.680]   What are you crazy?"
[00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:08.680]   Enterprise.
[00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:10.680]   But it's enterprise, exactly.
[00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:13.680]   So, tell me, Renee, that you installed Outlook on the Mac.
[00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:15.680]   No, I can't do it, Leo.
[00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:18.680]   I worked the enterprise for so long and it was so painful.
[00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:20.680]   Once I got out, I just ran and never looked back.
[00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:24.680]   All right, that means I have to download it and install it.
[00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:26.680]   I saw the interface that leaked and it was just horrible.
[00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:28.680]   It was like a button explosion.
[00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:30.680]   It was not human.
[00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:31.680]   You know what?
[00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:35.680]   They say, "Now it looks the same as it does on Windows."
[00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:36.680]   Oh.
[00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:38.680]   That's a selling point.
[00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:42.680]   We're a producer without a look and every time she opens it, I'm like, "What is this?
[00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:43.680]   What are you doing?
[00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:44.680]   I don't understand.
[00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:45.680]   This is horrible.
[00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:47.680]   This is a horrible life."
[00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:48.680]   Yeah.
[00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:49.680]   Well, okay.
[00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:53.680]   You have an inability to say no to features, which is not always the best thing.
[00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:57.680]   But if you're an enterprise, exactly right.
[00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:00.680]   You know, R's Technica says the new Outlook for Mac shines.
[00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:02.680]   Lee Hutchinson writing.
[00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:06.680]   But he does say licensing confusion gets in the way.
[00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:08.680]   Outlook for Mac.
[00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:11.680]   Because they have an office for the Mac in four years.
[00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:14.680]   I mean, we really are due for an office upgrade.
[00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:15.680]   That will come later.
[00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:16.680]   You need an update that I were.
[00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:17.680]   Right.
[00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:20.680]   Apple's not doing it either.
[00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:22.680]   Do people not do work anymore?
[00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:23.680]   Is that it?
[00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:25.680]   Oh, I mean, they just did update iWork.
[00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:26.680]   They took it.
[00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:27.680]   They put it over the mic.
[00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:28.680]   They stripped everything out.
[00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:29.680]   Yeah.
[00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:30.680]   Yeah.
[00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:31.680]   Yeah.
[00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:32.680]   That's not an update.
[00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:33.680]   The cost is compatible now and moving forward.
[00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:34.680]   They're going to update it.
[00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:35.680]   Yeah.
[00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:37.680]   It does seem like there's no pressure on productivity.
[00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:38.680]   Yeah.
[00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:40.680]   Like nobody really needs it anymore.
[00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:43.680]   What the hey, who needs productivity?
[00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:44.680]   We've got Photoshop.
[00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:45.680]   We're fine.
[00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:46.680]   I'm installing.
[00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:47.680]   Believe it or not.
[00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:48.680]   I'm installing.
[00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:54.680]   Well, I find that, you know, when we want to be collaborative, we typically are using Google.
[00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:58.680]   When we want to go fast and make it look pretty, then we use the Apple products.
[00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:05.680]   And the Windows products are kind of this kind of bad middle ground that don't seem to really make any sense if you're an Apple user.
[00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:08.680]   Unless you have to integrate with, you know, enterprise.
[00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:09.680]   Yeah.
[00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:11.680]   They're compatible.
[00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:16.680]   So I've run the installer and just silently quit and that's all.
[00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:19.680]   I don't know what I'm now supposed to do.
[00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:21.680]   That's it?
[00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:23.680]   What do I do?
[00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:24.680]   Ouch.
[00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:25.680]   Look.
[00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:26.680]   Oh, there we go.
[00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:28.680]   I guess it just didn't know there.
[00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:30.680]   Oh, I see.
[00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:33.680]   They're product deactivate.
[00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:34.680]   Thank you.
[00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:37.680]   This must be that licensing hell that they're talking about.
[00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:40.680]   So, okay, don't show my screen.
[00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:43.680]   I have to sign in to my office.
[00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:45.680]   365.
[00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:46.680]   Anyway.
[00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:50.680]   Ours Technica says the issue is it's great.
[00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:51.680]   It's great.
[00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:52.680]   Wonderful.
[00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:54.680]   Love it.
[00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:57.680]   And licensing is a nightmare.
[00:42:57.680 --> 00:43:02.680]   It can only be used if you have certain, not all, Office 365 subscriptions.
[00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:09.680]   If you don't pay for a monthly subscription or you buy a box, they call that the perpetual
[00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:14.680]   version, you're going to have to wait until next year to get the new outlook.
[00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:18.680]   Oh, not all subscriptions are eligible, apparently.
[00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:20.680]   So you have to have the right licensing.
[00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:21.680]   Let me see if mine is.
[00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:22.680]   I'm just curious now.
[00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:27.680]   I had the similar problem with Adobe because I got the retina iMac and I wanted to put Photoshop on it.
[00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:31.680]   But I already had it on to Max and I can't pay them more money to add another license after
[00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:35.680]   either create a second account or you have to log off of one machine, go log into another
[00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:39.680]   machine which I never remember to do and then they get cranky if you do it too often.
[00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:46.680]   Yeah, at least Microsoft with the office, some of the office subscriptions, the one I have,
[00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:48.680]   lets you install it in five different machines.
[00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:49.680]   So that's nice.
[00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:50.680]   Yeah.
[00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:53.680]   That's kind of where I got it.
[00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:54.680]   Okay.
[00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:56.680]   Sign in to activate office.
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:57.680]   Sign in failed.
[00:43:57.680 --> 00:44:02.680]   And Renee, so Photoshop gets cranky if you go in two different computers.
[00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:03.680]   I haven't had that happen yet.
[00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:04.680]   How many can you install it?
[00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:06.680]   I thought it was just for one.
[00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:07.680]   It's two.
[00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:09.680]   If you can do two and if you're on a machine, it's not licensed.
[00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:14.680]   You can tell to forget all the other licenses, but it doesn't like you to do that more than once every 24 hours.
[00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:18.680]   But then you can log out of a machine if it's near you and then go log in.
[00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:19.680]   Okay.
[00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:20.680]   That's good to know.
[00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:21.680]   I thought it was just one.
[00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:22.680]   That's good.
[00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:23.680]   You can get it.
[00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:27.680]   Once you install it, you can have two of them running at any point in time.
[00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:35.680]   I guess I don't do it often enough to run into that problem, but I very frequently am on another computer and I just log in as myself until I forget the other ones.
[00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:37.680]   I'll figure I'll get back to them later.
[00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:38.680]   Yeah.
[00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:50.680]   As long as they have LastPass, because of course I gave it some long hash and it's the one place that doesn't, LastPass doesn't work as well because Adobe's got their crazy cloud weird flash thing that they've installed.
[00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:54.680]   Yeah, I use it when the password is the same problem. You have to cut and paste like an animal.
[00:44:54.680 --> 00:45:02.680]   You can just like, oh, I feel like when you're used to LastPass and anything does anything other than the way it was supposed to work, you're just like, oh, what am I doing here?
[00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:03.680]   This is stupid.
[00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:05.680]   One of these people they hate.
[00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:06.680]   We just want to work.
[00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:07.680]   Why do we jump?
[00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:07.680]   I know.
[00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:08.680]   I know.
[00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:09.680]   I just want to go to click and have it go away.
[00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:10.680]   So.
[00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:13.680]   Oh, I give up.
[00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:15.680]   I'll install.
[00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:17.680]   I'll talk about it next week, I guess.
[00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:18.680]   I should have.
[00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:19.680]   I feel bad.
[00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:20.680]   I'm not going to install it.
[00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:23.680]   This is the thing to talk about is the fact that it's paying the next week.
[00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:26.680]   Well, that you have to download a group of ninjas around their way to help you, Leo.
[00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:33.680]   It's because you have to, the licensing means you log into your account, right, because it's a subscription.
[00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:37.680]   And I've had problems with doing this in the past, but that's, you know what?
[00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:40.680]   It's me and every, and you know, this happens to me all the time when I use Microsoft products.
[00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:44.680]   I think that my mind doesn't work this that way.
[00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:46.680]   And other people go, oh, this is obvious.
[00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:49.440]   And Lee Hutchison wrote this as the senior reviews editor.
[00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:50.440]   He likes it.
[00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:51.440]   So it must be good.
[00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:52.440]   Yes.
[00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:53.440]   Yes.
[00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:57.560]   Although one upshot of Microsoft's confusing licensing, he writes is born out at ours.
[00:45:57.560 --> 00:46:01.640]   Many of us at ours use Max with the enterprise version of Office 365.
[00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:06.640]   But we found that most of the staff was unable to upgrade.
[00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:07.640]   That's ours.
[00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:08.640]   Technica.
[00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:11.320]   That's not like, that's not like the business guy at somewhere, whatever.
[00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:12.320]   That is ours.
[00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:14.320]   Technica is having trouble upgrading their thing.
[00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:15.960]   That is so maybe I don't feel so bad.
[00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:19.560]   The problem appears to be that while Office 365 consumer accounts have access to the new
[00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:24.360]   outlook, not all tiers of Office 365 commercial accounts do.
[00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:27.600]   And even if you have the new outlook because of a personal consumer subscription, it will
[00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:32.760]   not allow you to connect to an exchange server account that is not licensed at the appropriate
[00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:33.760]   Office 365 level.
[00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:35.760]   That's such a headache.
[00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:37.760]   No shame on you.
[00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:43.560]   Just imagine someone like waving this big red flag or we might have wanted to not make
[00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:45.040]   it hard to actually upgrade.
[00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:47.600]   I could have caused brighter the pattern is full.
[00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:50.480]   This is why people use LibreOffice.
[00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:55.200]   So Trent Reznor, many people, you know, think of Beats, they think of Dr. Dre.
[00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:57.960]   They think of Jimmy Iovine.
[00:46:57.960 --> 00:47:03.480]   But they don't think of Trent Reznor, who is the front man for nine inch nails.
[00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:08.320]   He is in fact, chief creative officer.
[00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:13.680]   He just, he declined to have a headphone named after him.
[00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:17.840]   And it would have been a good headphone though, the Reznor.
[00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:18.840]   The Reznor.
[00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:19.840]   I'm declining.
[00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:20.840]   He says no.
[00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:26.000]   But he is going to do some stuff at Apple.
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:34.480]   He says that he gave an interview to Billboard saying he is fully in it right now on an unannounced
[00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:36.280]   music project.
[00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:40.040]   Reznor's role is described as an evolution of his role at Beats.
[00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:41.400]   Quote, it's related to that.
[00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:46.800]   Beats was bought by Apple and they expressed direct interest in me designing some products
[00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:48.000]   with them.
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:51.600]   I can't go into the details, but I feel like I'm in a unique position where I could be
[00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:52.600]   of benefit to them.
[00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:57.240]   That does mean some compromises in terms of how much brain power goes towards music and
[00:47:57.240 --> 00:47:58.240]   creating.
[00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:01.480]   I think there's one reason that you don't see Dre a lot and Cupertino because he's still
[00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:04.240]   in the studio recording and producing people.
[00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:05.920]   But Reznor says it's very creative work.
[00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:11.720]   It's not directly making music, but it's around music.
[00:48:11.720 --> 00:48:12.720]   I'm fully in it right now.
[00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:13.720]   It's challenging.
[00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:14.720]   It's unfamiliar.
[00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:20.560]   It's kind of everything I asked for and the bad thing is it's everything I asked for.
[00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:25.600]   He says he believes streaming music is the right model for music distribution.
[00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:27.360]   And he's been he's been not in a channel.
[00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:28.960]   It's been way ahead of this for a long.
[00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:29.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:48:29.960 --> 00:48:30.960]   Yeah.
[00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:33.240]   So one of the things that they did in the early, you know, I don't know how long ago,
[00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:38.520]   five or six years ago was was they released, they actually put their album up on bit on
[00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:42.520]   bit torrent and let everybody download it.
[00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:47.640]   And then they had a CD that went out for $15, but then they did a collector's edition
[00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:51.920]   that I think there was three thousand copies at $250 each and they signed the album and
[00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:56.800]   they signed the CD and they made an album and then in the CD and there was all this extra
[00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:59.680]   stuff in it and they sold out of that in like a week or two.
[00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:03.200]   And then they also do GarageBand products so you could remix projects.
[00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:05.200]   You took a whole song.
[00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:11.360]   They bounced an entire Pro Tools so they didn't build it in GarageBand, but they took they
[00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:15.840]   took one of their songs and they bounced all the tracks out of Pro Tools and put it all
[00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:20.280]   into GarageBand and it is like a master's course in how to mix it.
[00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:21.280]   Awesome.
[00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:24.280]   You know, like it was it was both overwhelming and exciting and you just you could just sit
[00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:28.040]   there and just dig into it for hours of looking at how they, you know, the transitions and
[00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:29.640]   how they're setting everything up.
[00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:33.800]   So he's definitely, you know, really seeing that there's got to be new and interesting
[00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:36.960]   ways of engaging listeners.
[00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:37.960]   And there is a lot of tears.
[00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:40.840]   You know, I think that one of the things that the music industry thinks of is everybody
[00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:46.160]   just buying singles or albums, but what about the, you know, the higher quality, the 24-bit
[00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:47.160]   audio?
[00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:50.680]   What about releasing albums that you can remix or pieces that you can remix and charging
[00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:53.760]   people a premium, there's a certain group of people that would do that.
[00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:57.880]   And I think that those are all things that I think he more than almost anybody out there
[00:49:57.880 --> 00:49:59.400]   would be thinking about.
[00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:00.760]   I think it's very interesting.
[00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:06.320]   He sounds like he's redesigning the Beats streaming music thing.
[00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:12.120]   He says, the quote, "The right streaming service could solve everybody's problems."
[00:50:12.120 --> 00:50:17.400]   And this coming, you know, a day or two before it was announced today, Taylor Swift has pulled
[00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:19.560]   all her music off Spotify.
[00:50:19.560 --> 00:50:22.400]   Artists don't like streaming because they make so little money on it.
[00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:25.760]   Well, but part of it is that it's a tiny little market right now.
[00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:28.320]   So of course, people aren't making enough money because not everybody's doing it.
[00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:32.440]   But once you have, you know, at 17 million or 15 million users, yeah, that's a drop in
[00:50:32.440 --> 00:50:37.600]   the bucket, but you're getting, the artists are getting a percentage of the entire bucket.
[00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:43.000]   And so, and so the thing is, is as that as you end up, and the trajectory is regardless
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:48.200]   of what artists want or wish for, you know, 80% of the market is going to be subscription
[00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:50.040]   in the next, you know, probably five years.
[00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:53.600]   And so, but as that happens, the other thing is, is that you now are going to have a lot
[00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:56.480]   of the pot that they're all sharing is going to be a lot bigger.
[00:50:56.480 --> 00:50:59.680]   And I think that that is, you know, I think a lot of more artists are going to make a
[00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:02.240]   lot more money that way in the long term.
[00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:05.520]   I think discoverability is still a challenge with a lot of these things.
[00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:06.520]   Right.
[00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:11.920]   But I tell you, I think that the music industry will be very happy to hear that it's not a
[00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:18.080]   label guy, not an R&D guy, not a tech guy, but a musician who is giving them input on
[00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:21.480]   what a streaming music service should be.
[00:51:21.480 --> 00:51:26.680]   Those are the people who it needs to, it needs to serve us as listeners, but it needs to
[00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:28.600]   serve them as creators.
[00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:31.240]   It's also, it's great that it comes from a creator.
[00:51:31.240 --> 00:51:35.240]   It's also a musician who's told the music industry where to go for all time.
[00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:36.240]   It's for you.
[00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:37.240]   Right.
[00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:38.240]   Yeah.
[00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:39.240]   So, so he's right on.
[00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:40.240]   You guys are all crazy.
[00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:41.240]   This is, this, this whole thing doesn't make any sense.
[00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:47.320]   And so, you know, I am going to revise my, my down signal on, on the beats acquisition
[00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:51.560]   because I've thought this was dumb in every respect, but I didn't count Trent Reznor
[00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:52.560]   in.
[00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:56.360]   And the fact that they got Trent and that he's going to work on a new, and they'll be, you
[00:51:56.360 --> 00:51:58.680]   know, there's, I don't know if they're going to rebrand it.
[00:51:58.680 --> 00:52:03.640]   He's shamed throughout the beats name, but a new subscription service from Apple early
[00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:10.720]   next year with the support of the mute of the musicians would be very exciting.
[00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:12.600]   I don't know how you can make musicians happy though.
[00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:15.680]   Apple's making noises about reducing the price.
[00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:19.880]   Spotify's already got their family planned down to five bucks a month.
[00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:26.440]   Well, I think, you know, I think that, that Apple, while it didn't go off well, I think
[00:52:26.440 --> 00:52:31.360]   the kind of thing that Apple, an Apple subscription service can, can do is what, what they saw
[00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:34.840]   with YouTube where, you know, there's big launches and Apple can do a lot of things that
[00:52:34.840 --> 00:52:37.120]   a lot of other subscription services can't do.
[00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:40.960]   I, I think that the, the, the, the YouTube, the YouTube one didn't go as well.
[00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:42.760]   Yeah, they can force it down.
[00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:45.360]   Well, but they didn't, you know, I think that, I think that is, they didn't really force
[00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:46.360]   it down.
[00:52:46.360 --> 00:52:47.360]   It's people who said that they wanted auto.
[00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:48.360]   I didn't get it.
[00:52:48.360 --> 00:52:49.360]   You know, you know, it didn't get, didn't get, didn't.
[00:52:49.360 --> 00:52:51.080]   And I turn on auto demo because I don't buy that much music.
[00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:53.000]   And when I do, I wanted to go on my phone.
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:54.000]   Right.
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:55.000]   Right.
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:56.000]   Yeah.
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:57.640]   So, so, you know, it's, I didn't do it because I'm on Spotify.
[00:52:57.640 --> 00:53:01.800]   So, so the, you know, I don't, I don't know, but I, but when Spotify, I download almost
[00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:02.800]   everything.
[00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:06.880]   And if they, if a YouTube, a YouTube album showed up on, in my, on my phone, I guess
[00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:10.040]   I, I wouldn't think that that was an upsetting thing.
[00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:13.080]   I mean, I think a lot of people made a lot of hay out of that for nothing.
[00:53:13.080 --> 00:53:17.480]   But the, but I think that there is, Apple can do a lot of those things and be aggressive
[00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:22.760]   about exclusive, you know, pay people that in ways that Spotify can't to have exclusive
[00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:24.640]   releases on their, on their platform.
[00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:27.600]   I think that, again, I think one of the big things that a lot of people are starting to
[00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:32.160]   talk about, not just for the music, but for video and everything else is really thinking
[00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:36.280]   about, you know, how the tastemakers are, you know, renumerated as well.
[00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:39.440]   I think that's part of the calculation that needs to be figured out is that it's no longer
[00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:40.440]   going to be radio.
[00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:43.760]   It's no longer going to be product placement, you know, from music and so on and so forth.
[00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:46.720]   What you have to figure out is how you get the 18 year old kid that everyone's listening
[00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:48.200]   to their mixes.
[00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:49.800]   How does he get to do that full time?
[00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:53.920]   And I think that figuring out a way to spread that out so that you have the kids that are
[00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:58.160]   figuring this out or the adults that really know jazz or whatever and having them actually
[00:53:58.160 --> 00:54:02.640]   get a little bit of kind of that, of that pot so that they can make that their business,
[00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:05.200]   you know, that is the, to me, that's the future of radio.
[00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:06.960]   Well, isn't that what pizza is all about?
[00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:12.120]   Isn't that what Ioween said, is it all about human, human created playlists?
[00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:16.040]   It is, but I don't think it's going to be a human created playlist by a bunch of employees
[00:54:16.040 --> 00:54:17.040]   of beats.
[00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:21.040]   I think it's going to be figuring out ways that humans can figure out those playlists.
[00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:25.760]   You know, my brother, for instance, has a great taste in rap music and these underground
[00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:29.120]   rap and all kinds of edgy stuff.
[00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:32.800]   And I love, you know, he makes me mixes and he always asks me what I want for Christmas.
[00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:33.800]   I'm like, I just wanted to mix.
[00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:36.800]   You know, and I would, you know, I mean, I think that there are people out there who
[00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:41.360]   out there like that that can make those, you know, that we want to listen to, that we want
[00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:42.640]   to get those mixes from.
[00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:43.640]   And yes.
[00:54:43.640 --> 00:54:44.640]   So I don't know, I do.
[00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:46.120]   I mean, because I don't want to listen to the radio.
[00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:47.120]   I don't want to listen to it.
[00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:48.120]   Right.
[00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:51.720]   I mean, there needs to be some discovery system and it probably is almost always somebody
[00:54:51.720 --> 00:54:54.800]   you know saying, hey, you would like this ultimately, right?
[00:54:54.800 --> 00:54:55.800]   Yeah.
[00:54:55.800 --> 00:55:00.640]   Even if it's a DJ on a, I don't think these exist anymore on an album or in a rock station.
[00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:01.640]   Well, I mean, and that was the thing.
[00:55:01.640 --> 00:55:03.920]   I mean, I think we, you know, talked about it at one point in time.
[00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:07.160]   You know, there was, you know, a lot of us when I was a music director for a radio station,
[00:55:07.160 --> 00:55:10.040]   you know, Mike Halloran in, in, in San Diego.
[00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:11.880]   I mean, all of us looked at his plate.
[00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:12.880]   Right.
[00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:15.680]   You know, like, you know, and all of us picked every, I mean, when he picks something, all
[00:55:15.680 --> 00:55:17.760]   the rest of us at least listened to it seriously.
[00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:19.560]   He says he gets bigger.
[00:55:19.560 --> 00:55:23.320]   I am, I am on the side of streaming music says Trent Reznor.
[00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:26.440]   And I think the right streaming service could solve everybody's problem.
[00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:29.400]   Owner ownership is waning.
[00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:30.400]   I think that's true.
[00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:30.400]   Remember Steve
[00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:32.840]   Jobs was the one who said, Oh, no, you want to own that record.
[00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:34.560]   He says, no, everybody's comfortable with the cloud.
[00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:37.120]   Now your documents, who knows where they are.
[00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:38.680]   They are there when you need them.
[00:55:38.680 --> 00:55:40.800]   That's what you were just talking about with your email.
[00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:44.640]   The idea that I've got my records on the shelf is Trent Reznor.
[00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:48.200]   Doesn't feel as important even to me as it used to.
[00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:51.840]   I just think we haven't hit quite the right formula yet.
[00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:53.440]   By the way, he grew up in North Pittsburgh.
[00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:54.440]   Did you know that?
[00:55:54.440 --> 00:55:55.440]   I did.
[00:55:55.440 --> 00:55:58.240]   I, in the middle of a cornfield.
[00:55:58.240 --> 00:55:59.400]   I don't know about that.
[00:55:59.400 --> 00:56:00.400]   So it says right here.
[00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:01.400]   It says it right here.
[00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:04.640]   You got, I didn't know that you got, I knew that he was, he was from Pittsburgh.
[00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:07.960]   I didn't know I, he's a farm boy like you.
[00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:09.160]   He's a farm boy.
[00:56:09.160 --> 00:56:10.160]   Yeah.
[00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:14.440]   He, the, his, his best album still was pretty hate machine in case anyone's wondering.
[00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:18.400]   Well, but and Trent, and by the way, the, the occasion for this interview and billboard
[00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:20.160]   is that he's turning 50.
[00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:23.760]   And so, you know, the kids today are not thinking of Trent Reznor as a hip guy.
[00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:26.440]   Yet he's doing music for films.
[00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:28.040]   He did the social network.
[00:56:28.040 --> 00:56:30.920]   Did great soundtrack for the social network.
[00:56:30.920 --> 00:56:35.080]   His most recent is Gone Girl, another fincher film.
[00:56:35.080 --> 00:56:39.560]   So he's definitely in, you know, making music that people are listening to, even if you don't,
[00:56:39.560 --> 00:56:42.040]   even if it's not nine inch nails.
[00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:49.040]   He did, by the way, he says, I was with Bono during the fated release of the U2 album.
[00:56:49.040 --> 00:56:50.440]   He says, I was with Bono that day.
[00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:51.520]   I was at the Apple event.
[00:56:51.520 --> 00:56:54.640]   We were hanging out after they did it.
[00:56:54.640 --> 00:56:56.680]   There's an immense sense of pride toward the album.
[00:56:56.680 --> 00:56:58.040]   He just spent several years making.
[00:56:58.040 --> 00:56:59.480]   He was very proud of what he did.
[00:56:59.480 --> 00:57:02.240]   But I think the misstep was the wording.
[00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:06.320]   If it would have been, here it is, if you want it, come get it.
[00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:09.560]   This is by the way, what I said, because Apple has a mechanism for that.
[00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:12.800]   I'm assuming the momentum of the situation led to the oversight and not thinking people
[00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:14.120]   might feel intruded upon.
[00:57:14.120 --> 00:57:16.040]   So he's a little sensitive to that.
[00:57:16.040 --> 00:57:21.720]   But I think, I think also guys that have moved out of alternative rock or, or any other
[00:57:21.720 --> 00:57:26.120]   cons, you know, whether it's Stuart Copeland or, or Danny Elfman or, or, or Trent Reznor,
[00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:28.120]   they really see this as a business.
[00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:30.320]   What is you have to make a living?
[00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:31.320]   Exactly.
[00:57:31.320 --> 00:57:36.120]   And so they're, they're figuring it out and they know that, that selling songs for them
[00:57:36.120 --> 00:57:40.360]   long ago probably hasn't been the thing that primarily paid their bills, you know, making
[00:57:40.360 --> 00:57:42.080]   music is still paying their bills.
[00:57:42.080 --> 00:57:44.520]   But they're looking at it from a different angle.
[00:57:44.520 --> 00:57:50.440]   Well I, I, I, I, I for one am thrilled that, I would hope that more musicians would get
[00:57:50.440 --> 00:57:51.440]   involved in this discussion.
[00:57:51.440 --> 00:57:56.600]   And I would guess at Jimmy Iovine, Dr. Dre and Trent Reznor could probably bring in a
[00:57:56.600 --> 00:58:00.120]   pretty big crew of people and say, what is it that you need?
[00:58:00.120 --> 00:58:01.120]   But I think it's interesting.
[00:58:01.120 --> 00:58:05.160]   I mean, they're basically acknowledging, look at people don't buy records.
[00:58:05.160 --> 00:58:06.160]   They listen to streaming music.
[00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:08.360]   So how do we make this work for musicians?
[00:58:08.360 --> 00:58:12.120]   And once you, and once you change over to, to, to subscription service, I mean, it took
[00:58:12.120 --> 00:58:14.920]   me a little while and I didn't quite get it and I had a couple of false starts.
[00:58:14.920 --> 00:58:18.120]   But once you get into subscription services, you, you stop really, you really.
[00:58:18.120 --> 00:58:19.120]   Oh yeah, I love it.
[00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:20.120]   I'm buying songs.
[00:58:20.120 --> 00:58:21.120]   I mean, I like the hybrids.
[00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:23.600]   So, so I have to say I use Google music.
[00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:28.160]   Amazon would be the same where you can actually not so much with Amazon, but with Google music,
[00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:33.040]   you've got the subscription, but all your, it's kind of like iTunes match plus subscription.
[00:58:33.040 --> 00:58:36.840]   And I think that's something Apple could do where all, all of everything you've ever bought
[00:58:36.840 --> 00:58:40.840]   and everything you've ever owned and digitized is in the cloud and available to you on all
[00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:45.040]   your devices, plus this great streaming music service.
[00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:48.200]   And you know, maybe that's the key because I don't think a musicians, musicians aren't
[00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:51.760]   going to be happy unless they make more money, period out of this stuff.
[00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:56.560]   So maybe if it ties into kind of here you like this, maybe you'd like to give some money
[00:58:56.560 --> 00:59:00.200]   to the artist and get some extra stuff or maybe you'd want to download it, that kind
[00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:01.200]   of thing.
[00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:03.560]   Well, and I think also we're looking at different generations of musicians.
[00:59:03.560 --> 00:59:06.800]   I mean, I think the next generation of musicians aren't really, when you talk to them, a lot
[00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:10.160]   of them aren't thinking about making millions from their, from their, their pretty, you know,
[00:59:10.160 --> 00:59:14.280]   the flat in the era is going to be, yeah, it's going to be, it's going to be their concerts.
[00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:15.600]   It's going to be the t-shirts.
[00:59:15.600 --> 00:59:20.480]   It's going to be a lot of the other stuff that happens around their music and not even selling
[00:59:20.480 --> 00:59:21.480]   directly.
[00:59:21.480 --> 00:59:25.040]   I understand why Taylor pulled her stuff out of Spotify.
[00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:26.040]   Is that a mistake though?
[00:59:26.040 --> 00:59:27.640]   I mean, there is promotional value to it.
[00:59:27.640 --> 00:59:31.440]   It's like saying you guys can't play it on the radio anymore.
[00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:36.080]   You know, I think that she's, she's in a unique position because she has a very, uh,
[00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:40.880]   She's a brand new album and their brand new album and very young and very, it is interesting.
[00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:44.840]   I think that I think it's a, it's a great, it's a big experiment to see, you know, how that,
[00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:45.840]   how that turns out.
[00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:49.920]   I think her, her label seems to be doing a lot of experimentation of holding back certain
[00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:53.520]   songs in Europe and, and taking it out of Spotify.
[00:59:53.520 --> 00:59:57.680]   And I think that they're experimenting with, and they can afford to because, you know, they,
[00:59:57.680 --> 01:00:02.280]   they have, you know, 16 year old girls that are saving up all summer to see her four times,
[01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:04.400]   you know, so they can, and she's making a lot of money.
[01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:06.840]   I mean, I'm sure she's making money on her album, but I'm sure she's making more money
[01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:07.840]   on her concerts.
[01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:10.560]   So, so I think that they're getting forward to experiment.
[01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:14.200]   I, you know, I, I'm not sure if it's going to work, but I think that she's one of the
[01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:16.760]   few artists that can afford to do it without paying a heavy price.
[01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:17.920]   Well, and she's super savvy.
[01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:23.720]   I mean, if you look at her Instagram feed, she really used Instagram, I think quite nicely
[01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:26.160]   to promote the album.
[01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:31.080]   She now, now it's pictures of her and people buying the CD.
[01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:35.000]   But before that, it was, it was pictures of the lyrics.
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.880]   It's kind of an interesting.
[01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:42.280]   This is before the album came out was pictures of the lyrics in different, in different forms
[01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:44.000]   and to promote it.
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:49.800]   And they would say, here's the bonus track, two days till release, one day to release.
[01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:54.080]   I mean, she really, I think did a great job in promoting this.
[01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:58.360]   She really, and they have, I mean, they have very, very, we've gotten, had the opportunity
[01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:04.200]   to work with a variety of artists and, and a lot of them have very savvy teams, whether
[01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:08.400]   it's Alicia Keys or Taylor Swift, Bruno Mars.
[01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:12.000]   I mean, these, these guys are all, you know, folks that, that spend a lot, they have a
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:13.520]   big team that's working on it.
[01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:16.720]   They're, they're, they're, they think through that as well and they have a lot of control
[01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:17.720]   over it.
[01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:20.720]   But they've got some incredible teams that are behind them that are planning this stuff
[01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:21.720]   out for a year.
[01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:23.480]   Look what else she's done.
[01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:28.040]   The physical CD of the new album comes with 13 Polaroids.
[01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:34.480]   There are five different sets, 65 and all collect all five with a handwritten lyric from
[01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:36.040]   1989 at the bottom.
[01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:39.320]   I mean, this is how you sell physical objects, right?
[01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:40.320]   Right.
[01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:41.320]   Brilliant.
[01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:44.680]   You might sell five CDs to a true fan and wants all the Polaroids, right?
[01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:48.160]   Well, that gets back to exactly what Trenton Resner did with his album, where he had, you
[01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:52.880]   know, instead of just selling music, he sold the experience and sold, made a lot of money
[01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:53.880]   doing it.
[01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:54.880]   Yeah.
[01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:58.000]   So I think that looking for ways to, to add value, I think this got, this got out.
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:03.240]   Like for instance, when Apple started releasing, having stores and all the Apple resellers
[01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:04.800]   were like, well, you're cutting into our business.
[01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:06.920]   Well, Apple wasn't cutting into the value ad business.
[01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:10.240]   So we provide stuff for the video market or the business market, what they were doing
[01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:12.760]   and saying, you can't just sell Apple stuff.
[01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:13.760]   You can't just sell that.
[01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:18.880]   You need to that, you know, truly add value, be a value added reseller of our.
[01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:22.160]   And I think that, you know, I think that there's a lot of places for artists to make
[01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:26.520]   a lot of money from their, you know, working with their fans and providing goods that their
[01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:28.200]   fan really want, their fans really want.
[01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:30.040]   And I think that there's a huge opportunity there.
[01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:35.480]   And I think that thinking about it in, in, in, I want to sell songs is a very my optic,
[01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:38.280]   you know, view of, of what's possible.
[01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:41.480]   Let's talk Pete Calc.
[01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:43.920]   I like the peak out folks.
[01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:46.480]   Um, actually it's a guy.
[01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:47.960]   It's a single guy, right, Renee?
[01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:50.280]   James Thompson, James Thompson.
[01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:53.560]   He is, he's really supported the podcast movement.
[01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:59.040]   He, for instance, sponsored Jason Snell's page.
[01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:02.780]   It's just a calculator, but he did something I think very interesting.
[01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:11.000]   He made the calculator work in the notifications bar so that you could install the app and
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:16.480]   then you would get an iOS a widget that would have a calculator in it.
[01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:23.120]   Apple yanked the app saying notification center widgets on iOS cannot perform calculations.
[01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:26.800]   The weird thing is it was already in the store.
[01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:29.280]   It had already been approved.
[01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:30.720]   I, is it back now?
[01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:31.720]   What's the latest?
[01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:36.040]   So, I mean, it's a, it's a complicated issue and it goes to the core of how the app store
[01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:39.280]   works or doesn't work, uh, depending on your point of view.
[01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:43.560]   So Apple announced extensibility, which, and part of that is today view widgets and
[01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:46.080]   they have it on both Yosemite and on iOS.
[01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:48.440]   Apple made their own calculator widget on Yosemite.
[01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:52.040]   They did not make one on iOS, whether you can read anything into that or not, you know,
[01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:53.560]   depends on your point of view.
[01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:58.000]   So James Thompson took peak balcony, managed to get the entire calculator portion.
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.760]   It's, it does a lot more than just calculations.
[01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:01.800]   The very sophisticated scientific engineering calculator.
[01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:06.080]   But he put the basic calculator functionality in an iOS eight widget.
[01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:09.440]   It got approved by the app store and it got featured by the app store.
[01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:13.000]   Uh, now one of the things that I don't know if everybody knows that the app store isn't
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.000]   one thing.
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:18.200]   So for example, developer relations in app review are under Phil Schiller, who's a senior
[01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:22.800]   vice president of marketing, where app store management and app store reviewer under eddy
[01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:25.200]   Q, who's a senior vice president of services.
[01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:28.400]   So Apple featuring something doesn't say anything about the review process.
[01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:29.400]   Oh, it wasn't.
[01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:31.080]   So they didn't reject it.
[01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:35.800]   Well, it was approved and then by Schiller's review team and then it was featured by eddy
[01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:40.040]   Q's editorial team, but the editorial team has no review purview.
[01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:43.600]   So it being featured means nothing other than they saw it thought it was good.
[01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:44.600]   Put it up on the store.
[01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:45.600]   Yeah.
[01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:46.600]   Yeah.
[01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:47.600]   They like it.
[01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:50.920]   Someone else, maybe more senior in the review team then said, wait a minute.
[01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:53.200]   This is not what we intended the widgets to be.
[01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:58.840]   We wanted them to be very quick, very light interactions or information on iOS on on your
[01:04:58.840 --> 01:04:59.840]   somebody.
[01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:03.200]   It's a different thing, but on iOS, we don't want anything as full functional as a calculator
[01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:04.200]   here.
[01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:06.840]   We didn't expect anybody could do it because frankly, James Thompson, he worked on the
[01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:07.840]   finder at Apple.
[01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:08.840]   He's not easy.
[01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:09.840]   Oh, really?
[01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:10.840]   Really?
[01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:11.840]   All right.
[01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:13.880]   He managed to get an entire calculator and they, this is one of those situations where
[01:05:13.880 --> 01:05:18.360]   it sounds like Apple has this category called unanticipated where they didn't think anybody
[01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:19.360]   could do it.
[01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:21.920]   And then they saw it and they were like, this is not what we wanted.
[01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:22.920]   So they called them.
[01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:23.920]   They didn't yank the app.
[01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:24.920]   They just said, we needed to remove this.
[01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:25.920]   Remove the widget or we will.
[01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:26.920]   Or we will.
[01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:27.920]   Yeah.
[01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:31.960]   And then, you know, you can go back and you know, he was very classy about it.
[01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:32.960]   He mentioned it on Twitter.
[01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:36.400]   He didn't go running to the press or anything, but a lot of us picked it up and we we talked,
[01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:40.520]   we looked into the story and then Apple, I know TechCrunch got an email about it.
[01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:42.040]   I got an email about it too.
[01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:43.920]   They said, then we moved it up the chain.
[01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:46.120]   I don't know if it went all the way to Phil Schiller or not, but they moved it up the
[01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:49.120]   chain and they evaluated it and they said, wait a minute, we're going to say this is
[01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:50.120]   okay.
[01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:51.120]   We weren't sure about it.
[01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:52.120]   We took a little bit of time.
[01:05:52.120 --> 01:05:53.120]   We thought it over.
[01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:54.120]   Good.
[01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:55.120]   I decided this is fine.
[01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:59.000]   But you know, this, this, this keeps happening where it gets through review and then later
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.800]   they sort of deal with it.
[01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:04.400]   It's hard to say what the solution is though, because no developer wants, you know, several
[01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:08.720]   weeks of them trying to make up their mind before the app is approved.
[01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:12.360]   One new versions of iOS come out, developers are encouraged to use these new features because
[01:06:12.360 --> 01:06:16.880]   they'll get featured, but if they use them too far beyond what Apple expected, they might
[01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:21.760]   get rejected and there's so many apps to get reviewed by the time a new OS version comes
[01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:24.520]   out that the reviewers are going as fast as they can anyway.
[01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:26.800]   So sort of a confluence of all the worst aspects.
[01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:28.680]   I can understand how that could happen.
[01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:31.360]   What would their objection to the calculator be though?
[01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:34.000]   Well, he would just remove the widget and it would go back to normal.
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:37.120]   Yeah, understand, but why wouldn't you want to end the notifications?
[01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:39.000]   They just originally thought it was too heavy for iOS.
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.360]   They didn't, they didn't want full apps.
[01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:42.840]   They didn't want anything, they didn't want you to be able to go to notification center
[01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:44.000]   and stay there.
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:47.040]   They were fine with you entering a formula and then getting booted into the calculator
[01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:48.040]   app.
[01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:52.800]   So you could put a tip calculator in notifications or the eBay app would tell you what that it's
[01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:55.400]   supposed to just be, you go there, you press a button in your back out, not that you're
[01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:57.800]   staying in there for any length of time.
[01:06:57.800 --> 01:07:00.920]   And part of this, at least the way I think is that there's no, there's no sort of central
[01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:01.920]   app store.
[01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:07.080]   Like Angela Aaron's runs Apple retail and Apple online, but there's no vice president
[01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:11.640]   of app store whose only job it is, is to make the app store awesome, like a really passionate,
[01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:16.400]   really high profile, really engaged individual who just wants to handle all these things.
[01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:18.960]   So you have like a bunch of different teams working on things.
[01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:22.400]   And I think it might be who of Apple as the app store makes more money when we see that
[01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:26.960]   every year for them to have this sort of a dedicated person in charge of that.
[01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:28.440]   Got it.
[01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:29.600]   Make it smoother for everybody.
[01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:30.600]   I agree.
[01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:31.600]   They should have that.
[01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:33.880]   Get on there and do that.
[01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:36.080]   Angela Aaron's is in charge of it now though, right?
[01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:37.080]   That's her.
[01:07:37.080 --> 01:07:41.160]   In charge of Apple store, not app store, app store is the services eddy Q, the editorial
[01:07:41.160 --> 01:07:45.120]   is eddy Q, the management is eddy Q, the review and the developer relations is still
[01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:46.120]   a killer.
[01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:49.840]   The frameworks are Craig Federicki.
[01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:52.360]   So it's no, you need, yeah, you need one person.
[01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:53.360]   Yeah.
[01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:54.360]   One person.
[01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:55.360]   You need an app store.
[01:07:55.360 --> 01:07:56.360]   You need an app store.
[01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:57.360]   You need an app store.
[01:07:57.360 --> 01:07:58.360]   Yeah.
[01:07:58.360 --> 01:08:00.960]   Because this happens again and again, and it's a little confusing to users and it's got
[01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:04.240]   to be terrible for developers who just don't know what the rules are.
[01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:07.520]   And frankly, it's bad for Apple too because they get negative publicity and people think
[01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:08.520]   they don't know what they're doing.
[01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:11.680]   And they actually, a lot of the people there used to be indie developers.
[01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:16.080]   They care about all these things too, which is getting navigated in the app stores not
[01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:17.080]   easy.
[01:08:17.080 --> 01:08:18.080]   All right.
[01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:19.080]   Well, now I get it.
[01:08:19.080 --> 01:08:20.080]   And by the way, it's back.
[01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:22.440]   They say, yeah, you can have a calculator widget.
[01:08:22.440 --> 01:08:23.440]   All right.
[01:08:23.440 --> 01:08:27.320]   If you insist, but please don't put a word processor in there.
[01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:30.920]   Well, that's the thing is like once you allow calculators, what's the next person going
[01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:33.040]   to try and it's a very blurry.
[01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:34.960]   Some things are very black and white.
[01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:35.960]   You can't have this.
[01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:36.960]   You can't have that.
[01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:37.960]   Things that are on the borderline.
[01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:40.680]   Like because the widgets are incredibly constrained.
[01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:44.400]   They can't use a lot of memory because you need the memory to run the main application.
[01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:47.880]   And what can you really fit in there and what can some developers fit and not others?
[01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:49.920]   And it's going to be interesting to see it.
[01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:50.920]   Jacob.
[01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:53.680]   Patrick Delahandy says he wants doom in the notifications.
[01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:59.760]   Christian Bale is out.
[01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:04.240]   Seth Rogen is in Christian Bale who was rumored to be playing Steve Jobs in the new Aaron
[01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:08.880]   Sorkin movie jobs based on the Walter Isaacson's biography.
[01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:14.600]   Perfect choice for casting, but Bale says, I'm not right for it too bad back to the drawing
[01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:16.160]   board.
[01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:21.440]   But Seth Rogen apparently is in according to variety to play was.
[01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:22.440]   I think that's great for was.
[01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:24.800]   I think that's a much better pick than we've seen any other movie.
[01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:25.800]   Much more sympathetic.
[01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:26.800]   Yep.
[01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:30.040]   I actually sent an email to was and he said he likes it.
[01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:31.040]   Nice.
[01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:33.440]   He's happy with the choice.
[01:09:33.440 --> 01:09:34.440]   I would be.
[01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:38.480]   I'd be honored.
[01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:40.680]   Apple is opening a there it is.
[01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:42.520]   He kind of he's was he?
[01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:43.520]   You know what?
[01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:47.240]   It's not about the looks and I think people focus on how much they look like that character.
[01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:49.040]   It's about the persona.
[01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:52.960]   And that's why Bale was so good for jobs because here's this artistic genius who is
[01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:58.520]   a little prickly, a little unpredictable, Bale had that volatile, you know, kind of you
[01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:00.520]   don't know what he's going to do.
[01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:01.520]   Perfect for jobs.
[01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:02.760]   It's not about a physical look.
[01:10:02.760 --> 01:10:08.320]   It's about the feeling and Rogen has that cuddly, you know, friendly, kind of slightly
[01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:11.280]   goofy persona that is exactly right.
[01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:15.840]   First, I think Steve Wozniak.
[01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:18.760]   Apple's opening a Seattle software office.
[01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:21.240]   They probably care about that in Seattle.
[01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:24.040]   Apple's opening a university in China.
[01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:27.800]   They probably care about that in China.
[01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:31.160]   Apple's going to offer free beats music on Southwest Airlines.
[01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:34.040]   You already can get dish TV on Southwest with their Wi-Fi.
[01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:36.080]   Now you'll be able to get beats music.
[01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:37.400]   They need to do more deals like that.
[01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:38.400]   Get people.
[01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:39.760]   I mean, that's how you have to introduce people to beats.
[01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:42.720]   And I love the headphones on the airplane.
[01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:44.200]   Yeah.
[01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:46.760]   Rock it out, man.
[01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:49.480]   It's all the kid airplanes are wearing these days.
[01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:52.720]   And again, those are the kind of things that Apple can get very aggressive about in ways
[01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:56.760]   that, you know, it's hard for a lot of their competitors to do.
[01:10:56.760 --> 01:10:57.840]   They can spend a lot of money on them.
[01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:01.160]   Who's going to say no to that?
[01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:03.440]   Right.
[01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:07.600]   Storyfromfiercewireless.com.
[01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:11.240]   Remember we talked a little bit about the sim that's in the iPad that lets you choose
[01:11:11.240 --> 01:11:12.240]   your carrier.
[01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:15.520]   Anybody but for Ryzen, they didn't want to play.
[01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:22.280]   And which is such a great idea because you could also, if it wasn't AT&T who locks it,
[01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:25.080]   you could switch months a month and so forth.
[01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:32.280]   But don't expect that to show up in phones, iPhones according to an Apple exec.
[01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:36.040]   Jaws, Greg Jawswieac, he's the Vice President of iPhone, iPod and iOS.
[01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:38.000]   So I think he knows what he's doing.
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:41.680]   He says the sim makes more sense for the iPad than for the phone because most iPhones
[01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:46.080]   by far are sold through carriers.
[01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:47.080]   That's a good point.
[01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:50.280]   It's about the customer experience he said at Recode Mobile.
[01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:55.640]   We ultimately don't know who you're going to use as the carrier and we want to make
[01:11:55.640 --> 01:11:56.640]   it as easy as possible.
[01:11:56.640 --> 01:11:58.280]   Always talking about the iPad thing.
[01:11:58.280 --> 01:12:00.720]   That's because they sell it retail through the stores.
[01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:03.920]   It'd probably still be better for consumers if they had Apple Sims in the phones but it's
[01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:06.520]   not better for carriers who are in the intermediary.
[01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:11.120]   I think really that's the subtext of this is we have more clout with the iPad than we
[01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:12.120]   do with the iPhone.
[01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:17.360]   Well I think you remember Leo and they had a patent for a completely virtual SIM card
[01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:21.600]   and the carriers went bananas before they even floated it.
[01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:22.880]   No, we're not doing this.
[01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:24.880]   It'll be a backlash.
[01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:26.080]   Slowly we move.
[01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:34.600]   He does think that perhaps the Apple SIM card will be available at some time.
[01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:39.360]   But he says anything that's new people want to stop and evaluate it.
[01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:43.040]   Some countries still have dual SIM phones because in some places in India there's just no reception
[01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:45.200]   in one area and there isn't another where people have to.
[01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:51.360]   It would be great for consumers if we could have this technology.
[01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:56.200]   Apple is rapidly approaching 1 billion iOS devices sold.
[01:12:56.200 --> 01:13:01.440]   Customers have downloaded 85 billion apps from the App Store.
[01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:07.040]   Jaws says Apple has a naive belief that if we just make a better product or better experience
[01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:09.040]   that we'll be a market for it.
[01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:12.600]   It seems like a good, that doesn't seem naive.
[01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:14.560]   If you build it they will come.
[01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:16.120]   All right, let's take a break.
[01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:17.120]   Come back.
[01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:20.080]   We're going to get your tips and picks my friends.
[01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:22.720]   But first word from Linda.com.
[01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:24.280]   Why do love Linda.com?
[01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:27.760]   We had Bert Monroi yesterday on triangulation.
[01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:28.760]   Everybody loves Bert.
[01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:36.040]   He is the Photoshop guru and he does a weekly show about Photoshop that is so great.
[01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:38.200]   I just love it so much.
[01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:40.400]   It's free for the first week too.
[01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:45.080]   You don't even have to have a Linda.com account which I think is so cool.
[01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:47.520]   L-Y-N-D-A.com.
[01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:51.840]   You're going to want to make an account because Bert also has courses on the thing.
[01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:53.080]   Let me show you Bert's courses.
[01:13:53.080 --> 01:14:00.920]   He has courses on how he made his newest painting which he just released which is an Amsterdam
[01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:01.920]   misty calls.
[01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:05.360]   He has the pixel playground which you can go see free.
[01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:08.440]   But the Amsterdam, he has the dreamscapes which are wonderful.
[01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:12.480]   He takes pictures and retouches them to make them dreamscapes.
[01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:15.600]   But then he also has the Amsterdam misty.
[01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:16.600]   How he did it.
[01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:19.720]   The making of Amsterdam misty natural elements.
[01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:21.920]   The making of Amsterdam misty structures.
[01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:24.800]   He did a little bit of that yesterday on triangulation.
[01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:29.240]   If you saw that I think you probably immediately signed up for a course at Linda.com.
[01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:30.480]   Actually, that's the nice thing.
[01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:33.320]   You don't just sign up for a course at Linda.com.
[01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:35.760]   You get free run of the place.
[01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:39.920]   You can take any of their thousands of courses all beautifully produced.
[01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:45.440]   Let me just show you the making of Times Square.
[01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:52.440]   My connection with Bert other than Twit and Tech TV is he actually taught me Photoshop.
[01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:54.840]   He did a class in 1992.
[01:14:54.840 --> 01:14:57.960]   You cannot get somebody better to teach you Photoshop.
[01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:05.680]   There was a class in South San Francisco for going from Photoshop 2.5 to 3.0.
[01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:08.040]   Production value on Linda.com is awesome.
[01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:10.440]   If you want to learn Photoshop from Bert Munwri, you can.
[01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:15.200]   He is obviously on a green screen set because he's actually in the painting right now.
[01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:16.200]   It's amazing.
[01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:18.280]   It looks great.
[01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:20.040]   How did he make this?
[01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:23.080]   Well, he did it with some amazing Photoshop techniques.
[01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:25.720]   There's no one better to teach you Photoshop than Bert Munwri.
[01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:27.840]   But I got to say that's what's great about Linda.com.
[01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:33.160]   They're learning how to use applications from the masters.
[01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:36.520]   They're not just very proficient at the program.
[01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:38.600]   They don't just do it in real life.
[01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:41.040]   They also are great teachers.
[01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:44.440]   I don't know how Linda.com does it, but they come up with the best.
[01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:47.720]   These are high quality videos, not like homemade YouTube videos.
[01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:51.320]   They break the courses up into bite-sized pieces so you can learn at your own pace.
[01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:54.000]   Watch a little bit of the time.
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:58.680]   Those include searchable transcripts so you can find the part you're looking for and jump
[01:15:58.680 --> 01:16:03.640]   right to it, playlists, and you can get certificates of course, completion, which you can use on
[01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:05.520]   your LinkedIn profile.
[01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:08.840]   Whether you're a beginner, an intermediate, or an advanced user, Linda.com will have a
[01:16:08.840 --> 01:16:10.840]   course for you.
[01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:14.720]   While you're on the go, you can learn with Linda's iPhone, iPad, and Android.
[01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:15.800]   We're doing Lightroom right now.
[01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:18.400]   Lisa and I are doing a Lightroom course on Linda.com.
[01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:23.960]   The best part is it's 25 bucks a month for unlimited access to over 100,000 video tutorials.
[01:16:23.960 --> 01:16:25.840]   You can get a premium plan too.
[01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:29.800]   That means you can download courses and watch them offline.
[01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:34.080]   Premium plan members can also download project files and practice along with the instructor.
[01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:37.640]   Great stuff for Photoshop users, but yeah, if you're interested in photography, they've
[01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:39.120]   got amazing stuff.
[01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:42.240]   Of course, there's a cover composition and exposure.
[01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:47.320]   Intermediate course is on lighting and using Photoshop and the GIMP to enhance photographs,
[01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:51.160]   advanced tutorials on things like color correction and of course mastering the Adobe Creative
[01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:52.160]   Cloud.
[01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:54.280]   That's where Bert Munroy comes in.
[01:16:54.280 --> 01:16:57.040]   What a genius.
[01:16:57.040 --> 01:17:03.600]   Some of our favorite people, Derek Story, Ben Gold, some of the best people are teaching
[01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:04.600]   at Linda.com.
[01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:06.400]   25 bucks a month.
[01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:10.640]   Tell you what, apparently you still don't believe me because you haven't signed up.
[01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:12.400]   What if I gave you a free seven day trial?
[01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:16.880]   You just go to Linda.com/MacBreak and now you've got the run of the place.
[01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:19.840]   In fact, I think really the challenge is going to be, "Oh, I want to learn that.
[01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:21.400]   Oh, I'd love to learn that.
[01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:29.240]   If you're a developer, you can learn Java, C. You can learn how to write for iOS, for Android,
[01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:35.320]   design patterns, game design, programming foundations, PHP, Python, Ruby.
[01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:36.320]   It just goes on and on.
[01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:38.240]   It's such a great resource.
[01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:39.240]   We love them.
[01:17:39.240 --> 01:17:40.840]   I'm really glad to have a Linda account.
[01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:42.800]   I've had a Linda account for years.
[01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:48.320]   L-Y-N-D-A-Linda.com/MacBreaktryit for a week today.
[01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:49.320]   You're going to love it.
[01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:50.320]   Here's a good one.
[01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:51.320]   The next software.
[01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:56.160]   These are those Google plugins now, like Silver Effects Pro, which is the best black and white
[01:17:56.160 --> 01:17:58.600]   tool ever.
[01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:00.520]   Learn how to use these tools.
[01:18:00.520 --> 01:18:04.000]   You'll be so thrilled it will give you such satisfaction.
[01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:05.560]   Linda.com/MacBreak.
[01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:07.400]   We thank them for their support.
[01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:10.560]   They've got a swished programming language course already.
[01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:11.560]   Wow.
[01:18:11.560 --> 01:18:13.560]   Let's see here.
[01:18:13.560 --> 01:18:19.400]   Alex Lindsey, do you have a pick for us this week?
[01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:20.400]   I do.
[01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:27.160]   I do a lot of animation of logos and stuff like that.
[01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:30.400]   A lot of things that have to be done very quickly.
[01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:35.000]   One of the secrets of this is the company called XaxWorks.
[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.080]   They just released their new version.
[01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:38.520]   It's called Pro Animator.
[01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:44.480]   This is a standalone piece of software that basically lets you bring in outlines.
[01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:50.240]   You can have your Illustrator or EPS file and pop it into 3D and animate it and stuff
[01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:55.320]   like that for your, whether it's education or corporate or this is the secret weapon for
[01:18:55.320 --> 01:18:59.480]   a lot of, almost every broadcast house I know.
[01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:03.320]   If you're looking for a way to do it, and they make plugins for After Effects and so
[01:19:03.320 --> 01:19:06.040]   on and so forth, but they make the standalone one and they just released it and it's got
[01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:11.120]   all kinds of incredible new things for everything from what's called ambient occlusion, which
[01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:16.560]   pays attention to whether objects are close to each other and it starts creating drop shadows,
[01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:20.880]   a lot of what's called instant scene, which takes a whole bunch of objects and does it
[01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:23.640]   automatically throws them out there for you.
[01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:30.080]   There's a lot of these cool animations that are really, you don't have to become this
[01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:34.240]   Maya animator or a Cinema 4D animator to do this stuff.
[01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:36.040]   You can get a lot of this stuff very quickly.
[01:19:36.040 --> 01:19:43.720]   If you're thinking about a quick animation for your website or for your industrial video
[01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:46.960]   or for broadcast, because as I said, a lot of this is used for broadcast, it's used for
[01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:53.120]   titles or movies, all of this stuff is stuff that is very corporate video and so on and
[01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:54.120]   so forth.
[01:19:54.120 --> 01:19:58.160]   It's just really much easier to do it here if you're not really going to make the commitment
[01:19:58.160 --> 01:20:02.320]   to really becoming a 3D guru.
[01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:06.960]   I've used it since version one, so I'm always excited every time and this is probably one
[01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:10.520]   of the biggest upgrades he's come out with.
[01:20:10.520 --> 01:20:17.520]   So anyway, this is a pro animator from Zaxxworks and it's a great value.
[01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:25.880]   Z-A-X-W-E-R-K-S dot com.
[01:20:25.880 --> 01:20:26.880]   X works.
[01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:31.120]   Man, and it's only how many Alex's.
[01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:32.120]   I think it's about one.
[01:20:32.120 --> 01:20:35.120]   I can't put it back to it, but it's about one Alex.
[01:20:35.120 --> 01:20:36.760]   It actually looks cool.
[01:20:36.760 --> 01:20:40.800]   Let's go look at the, we're looking at the website, the demo reel.
[01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:41.800]   It's amazing.
[01:20:41.800 --> 01:20:44.480]   And when you look at this image-based rendering, what's happening there, you literally just
[01:20:44.480 --> 01:20:47.440]   take a, you know, you take a sphere with your iPhone or whatever and you can throw it on
[01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:50.480]   there and say, "This is what I want to light my objects with," so that when you put them
[01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:53.840]   back in front of the, in front of those things, it looks like they're in the scene.
[01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:55.840]   It's really cool.
[01:20:55.840 --> 01:21:00.120]   Mr. Rene Ritchie, you're pick of the week.
[01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:05.200]   So like you Leo, I've been playing with the new Retina 5K iMac and one of the things I
[01:21:05.200 --> 01:21:07.280]   wanted to do was test the gaming on it.
[01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:11.680]   And I noticed that Batman Arkham City had been updated to support the new Retina iMac,
[01:21:11.680 --> 01:21:13.080]   so I downloaded it.
[01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:14.080]   And then I wanted to control it.
[01:21:14.080 --> 01:21:15.600]   And the keyboard, Woodley, wasn't doing it.
[01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:18.240]   And I have a trackpad, not a mouse, and that was horrible.
[01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:21.240]   So I went and got an Xbox 360 controller.
[01:21:21.240 --> 01:21:23.760]   I plugged it in, and of course it didn't work.
[01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:27.720]   And I went to the usual place to get the usual driver that made it work, but it hadn't
[01:21:27.720 --> 01:21:29.680]   been updated since Snow Leopard.
[01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:33.400]   And while it continued working in Mavericks, it no longer worked in Yosemite.
[01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:36.160]   Some people said try an older one, but that didn't work either.
[01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:39.640]   So I did some searching around, and I found a GitHub repository that had an unofficial
[01:21:39.640 --> 01:21:42.760]   version of the unofficial version of the driver.
[01:21:42.760 --> 01:21:44.400]   And I downloaded it, and I installed it.
[01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:46.760]   It makes a pain right in system preferences.
[01:21:46.760 --> 01:21:52.400]   And once you have that installed, your Xbox 360 controller just shows up, and then you
[01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:57.240]   can use it to play whichever game support, game pads on the Mac.
[01:21:57.240 --> 01:22:01.760]   And the Xbox 360 is quite a good controller, at least I've always loved it since Halo.
[01:22:01.760 --> 01:22:06.840]   And I used it and I was playing Arkham Asylum in 5K, admittedly not at a fantastic frame
[01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:11.360]   rate, but I was playing Arkham City in 5K with an Xbox controller.
[01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:12.360]   So it was fantastic.
[01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:13.360]   That is neat.
[01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:17.640]   Now somebody says in the chatroom that PS3 and 4 controllers just work out of the box.
[01:22:17.640 --> 01:22:21.560]   Yeah, if you have one, I did not have one, and I was going to go buy one, but then I saw
[01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:22.560]   this and I had a bunch of 360 controllers.
[01:22:22.560 --> 01:22:25.200]   I have lots of 360 controllers lying around.
[01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:28.080]   You don't know if there's an Xbox One controller mod.
[01:22:28.080 --> 01:22:29.560]   I do not.
[01:22:29.560 --> 01:22:30.560]   I don't have an Xbox One.
[01:22:30.560 --> 01:22:32.560]   I happen to have 360s lying around.
[01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:35.600]   Yeah, that's it, because it was just an extra controller and I had a bunch of Macs.
[01:22:35.600 --> 01:22:38.680]   And with this driver, I could literally put one controller on every Mac and I'll have
[01:22:38.680 --> 01:22:39.680]   to worry about it.
[01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:40.680]   Right.
[01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:41.680]   Right.
[01:22:41.680 --> 01:22:43.800]   All right, very cool.
[01:22:43.800 --> 01:22:48.280]   Now have you seen, you're going to like this Renee, because you're a comic book guy.
[01:22:48.280 --> 01:22:49.760]   And I was hoping Alex would be here for this.
[01:22:49.760 --> 01:22:54.080]   Have you seen my new keycaps on my lapi-tuppi?
[01:22:54.080 --> 01:22:56.720]   They are completely impossible to use.
[01:22:56.720 --> 01:22:58.880]   But if you're into comic books...
[01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:00.040]   So nice.
[01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:01.040]   You're going to love these.
[01:23:01.040 --> 01:23:02.040]   These are from Killer Duck Decal-tuppi.
[01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:03.040]   Yeah, you can zoom in.
[01:23:03.040 --> 01:23:04.840]   I'll hold it still for you, Jason.
[01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:07.080]   I would never be able to type again.
[01:23:07.080 --> 01:23:08.080]   Well, you can...
[01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:09.560]   Every letter is there.
[01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:10.560]   Every number.
[01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:12.560]   You just, they're all done with comic books.
[01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:13.800]   W is for Wolverine.
[01:23:13.800 --> 01:23:15.040]   Yeah, W is Wolverine.
[01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:17.240]   B is for Batman.
[01:23:17.240 --> 01:23:18.240]   You see?
[01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:19.760]   And they have the little letters on there.
[01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:22.040]   It isn't just Marvel or DC.
[01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:23.280]   It's all mixed up.
[01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:27.880]   You know, as a comic book fan, you will, of course, immediately recognize many of these.
[01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:29.560]   Snicked and bam for like fight or flight.
[01:23:29.560 --> 01:23:30.560]   That's amazing.
[01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:33.280]   I love snicked and bamf.
[01:23:33.280 --> 01:23:35.400]   And pow!
[01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:38.200]   These are from Killer Duck Decals.
[01:23:38.200 --> 01:23:40.000]   What is snicked from Bampf?
[01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:41.000]   What is that from?
[01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.680]   A snicked is Wolverine popping his claws with his neck claw on teleporting away.
[01:23:43.680 --> 01:23:46.800]   That's the Adam Antian claws snapping at him.
[01:23:46.800 --> 01:23:47.800]   What is Bampf?
[01:23:47.800 --> 01:23:50.240]   Bampf is Nightcrawler teleporting.
[01:23:50.240 --> 01:23:54.600]   So, the snicked is on the shift key and Bampf is on the cast lock key.
[01:23:54.600 --> 01:23:56.160]   But you see, you can kind of see.
[01:23:56.160 --> 01:23:57.960]   I actually figured it out.
[01:23:57.960 --> 01:23:59.040]   They're a little hard to apply.
[01:23:59.040 --> 01:24:00.040]   There they are.
[01:24:00.040 --> 01:24:01.040]   That's Killer Duck Decals.com.
[01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:02.840]   They're a little hard to apply.
[01:24:02.840 --> 01:24:05.240]   But it's only 12 bucks.
[01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:06.640]   There's Shazam Leo.
[01:24:06.640 --> 01:24:08.040]   Shazam!
[01:24:08.040 --> 01:24:10.680]   That's on the return, of course.
[01:24:10.680 --> 01:24:13.040]   I'm a big fan of these.
[01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:16.840]   If you go to Killer Duck Decals, you'll see they have other skins as well.
[01:24:16.840 --> 01:24:17.840]   But 12 bucks, man.
[01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:19.120]   And they came very fast.
[01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:22.960]   They came in a couple of days after I ordered them.
[01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:24.800]   And I thought, wow, this is pretty cool.
[01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:28.240]   If you're a comic book fan, you'll enjoy it.
[01:24:28.240 --> 01:24:29.240]   It's a little bit of a type.
[01:24:29.240 --> 01:24:31.400]   Well, you can see the letters are there.
[01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:32.560]   It takes a little getting used to it.
[01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:35.040]   It helps if you're a touch typist.
[01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:38.240]   Or if you know exactly what Wolverine is.
[01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:40.240]   I'm ordering all the M is for Magneto's helmet.
[01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:41.240]   It means terrifically.
[01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:43.240]   Isn't that awesome?
[01:24:43.240 --> 01:24:46.240]   I is Iron Man.
[01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:47.560]   Who is P?
[01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:48.560]   Is that Skeletor?
[01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:49.560]   Punisher.
[01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:50.560]   Punisher.
[01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:52.320]   It's got to be pfft.
[01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:53.320]   Illiterative.
[01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:58.320]   Spiderman.
[01:24:58.320 --> 01:24:59.320]   Green Lantern.
[01:24:59.320 --> 01:25:00.320]   I love this.
[01:25:00.320 --> 01:25:01.320]   The Joker.
[01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:03.560]   It just gives you a little happiness.
[01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:05.320]   You was for Ultra Boy.
[01:25:05.320 --> 01:25:06.320]   Yeah.
[01:25:06.320 --> 01:25:07.320]   12 bucks to buy.
[01:25:07.320 --> 01:25:11.320]   Really, the cost is the effort to slowly one by one.
[01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:12.320]   Put these on.
[01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:15.000]   And I think your registration is quite good, Leo.
[01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:16.400]   You did a good job there.
[01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:19.280]   I was listening to security now while I did it.
[01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:21.200]   Some people knit.
[01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:24.240]   And people put on keycaps.
[01:25:24.240 --> 01:25:25.320]   And yes, they peel right off.
[01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:29.040]   It's kind of that 3M stuff that you can get off.
[01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:31.160]   So if you change your mind.
[01:25:31.160 --> 01:25:32.920]   I'm ordering them now.
[01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:34.920]   I thought you might.
[01:25:34.920 --> 01:25:35.920]   H is for Havoc.
[01:25:35.920 --> 01:25:37.160]   Now I know what's up.
[01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:38.160]   Get Jason Snell for the holiday.
[01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:39.560]   Oh, Jason Snell would love these.
[01:25:39.560 --> 01:25:41.040]   Andy Inaka would love these.
[01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:42.040]   Yeah.
[01:25:42.040 --> 01:25:44.560]   I know we have major comic book fans in our audience.
[01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:45.560]   So I thought I'd mention this.
[01:25:45.560 --> 01:25:50.560]   killerduckdcals.com.
[01:25:50.560 --> 01:25:52.560]   I don't see a Superman.
[01:25:52.560 --> 01:25:53.560]   Hmm.
[01:25:53.560 --> 01:25:54.560]   Hmm.
[01:25:54.560 --> 01:25:55.560]   Licensing.
[01:25:55.560 --> 01:25:57.360]   Well, there's some DC stuff.
[01:25:57.360 --> 01:25:59.480]   There's Batman.
[01:25:59.480 --> 01:26:02.760]   There's Captain America on the sea.
[01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:03.760]   I don't.
[01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:04.760]   That's Marvel, isn't it?
[01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:05.760]   I don't see a...
[01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:06.760]   You've got a lot of obscure ones.
[01:26:06.760 --> 01:26:07.760]   Oh, yeah.
[01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:08.760]   There's some...
[01:26:08.760 --> 01:26:09.760]   You've got to be...
[01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:10.760]   If you're a real comic book fan, you'll go, "Whoa."
[01:26:10.760 --> 01:26:12.560]   L is for Lobo, Zettis for Zorro.
[01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:13.560]   Yeah.
[01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:14.960]   E is for Electro.
[01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:16.960]   [Laughs]
[01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:18.560]   Pylus Chirli and Arto the Ninja Turtle.
[01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:20.280]   Oh, there's a Ninja Turtle on here.
[01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:21.280]   Look at that.
[01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:22.280]   Oh.
[01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:23.800]   You don't even see them after a while.
[01:26:23.800 --> 01:26:24.800]   You just kind of...
[01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:25.800]   Oh, look.
[01:26:25.800 --> 01:26:26.800]   [Laughs]
[01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:31.320]   Our show is every Tuesday, 11am Pacific.
[01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:33.720]   That is 2pm Eastern time.
[01:26:33.720 --> 01:26:35.720]   And now because of...
[01:26:35.720 --> 01:26:37.760]   We've retreated from daylight saving time.
[01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:41.320]   We are now at 1900 UTC.
[01:26:41.320 --> 01:26:45.800]   If you can figure out what time zone you're in, you can figure that out.
[01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:48.080]   1900 UTC on Tuesdays.
[01:26:48.080 --> 01:26:51.000]   But we always make automated audio and video available after the fact.
[01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:54.120]   You can get it at twit.tv/mbw.
[01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:57.320]   You could use our fabulous Twit apps on every platform.
[01:26:57.320 --> 01:26:58.320]   Of course, iOS.
[01:26:58.320 --> 01:27:00.160]   There's several on iOS.
[01:27:00.160 --> 01:27:03.600]   Android, even Windows Phone, Roku, you bet.
[01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:06.080]   Or just your favorite podcaster.
[01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:07.760]   There's so many great apps out now.
[01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:12.960]   In fact, if you want to see a review of some of the big ones, including Marco Arment's new
[01:27:12.960 --> 01:27:16.240]   one, Overcast, we did that to this week's iPad today.
[01:27:16.240 --> 01:27:20.800]   Look at some of the podcatchers out there.
[01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:24.600]   Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:27:24.600 --> 01:27:27.160]   Thank you, Alex Lindsey, Pixel Core.
[01:27:27.160 --> 01:27:28.160]   Thank you.
[01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:29.160]   Where are you going next?
[01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:30.480]   I'm coming to San Francisco next.
[01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:31.480]   So I'll be...
[01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:32.480]   So next week?
[01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:33.680]   I'll be there next week.
[01:27:33.680 --> 01:27:39.520]   And on Friday, now I know that Mark Zuckerberg is doing his own question answer on Thursday,
[01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:42.360]   but on Friday I'm going to follow that up with my question and answer.
[01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:43.360]   Awesome.
[01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:44.360]   Ask Alex.
[01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:50.920]   If you can get a little calendar thing and everything else, but it's bit.ly, just ask
[01:27:50.920 --> 01:27:51.920]   Alex 5.
[01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:53.760]   It'll be at 2 p.m. on Friday.
[01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:54.760]   We're just keeping...
[01:27:54.760 --> 01:27:59.120]   It's mostly just testing our system, but if you have questions about video or anything
[01:27:59.120 --> 01:28:02.480]   else, generally, Pittsburgh, I'll answer it.
[01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:04.280]   You think you're going to do this on a regular basis?
[01:28:04.280 --> 01:28:05.280]   That's neat.
[01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:06.280]   I've been...
[01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:09.280]   We use it a lot of times when we have a lot of new features in Hazoo.
[01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:11.480]   You know, our question and answer system.
[01:28:11.480 --> 01:28:16.800]   So I'm thinking of trying to make it a weekly thing, just kind of this random hodgepodge
[01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:17.800]   of things.
[01:28:17.800 --> 01:28:20.040]   So far, I haven't quite got to weekly, but I've got...
[01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:21.040]   This is the fifth one.
[01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:23.240]   So we're slowly moving down that path.
[01:28:23.240 --> 01:28:24.240]   Excellent.
[01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:26.200]   Renee Ritchie, iMore.com.
[01:28:26.200 --> 01:28:31.840]   Great to read everything there, but also the debug podcast is a must listen to each and
[01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:32.840]   every week.
[01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:34.200]   You do such a good job, Amor.
[01:28:34.200 --> 01:28:35.360]   iMore.com/debug.
[01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:40.000]   Anything you want to plug?
[01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:45.440]   Well, we relaunched Vector recently, so it went from an interview show to a panel show,
[01:28:45.440 --> 01:28:50.480]   so we have one designer, one developer, one psychoanalyst, and one media person, and
[01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:52.800]   we discuss human side of technology.
[01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:56.280]   And John Syracuse around too is the current debug.
[01:28:56.280 --> 01:28:57.280]   Yes.
[01:28:57.280 --> 01:28:58.760]   Always fun stuff.
[01:28:58.760 --> 01:28:59.760]   Yes.
[01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:02.680]   He explains why we're wrong about so many things.
[01:29:02.680 --> 01:29:05.920]   If it's coming from John, I believe it.
[01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:06.920]   Yes.
[01:29:06.920 --> 01:29:09.640]   Hey, thank you both of you for being here.
[01:29:09.640 --> 01:29:11.280]   Andy and I hope we'll be back next week.
[01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:12.280]   We will be back here next week.
[01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:14.040]   I hope you will be too.
[01:29:14.040 --> 01:29:17.320]   But meanwhile, time to get back to work because you know what?
[01:29:17.320 --> 01:29:18.720]   Take time.
[01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:19.120]   It's over.
[01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:29.520]   [Music]
