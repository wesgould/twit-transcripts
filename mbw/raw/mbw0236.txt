[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.000]   Welcome to live coverage of Apple's March event.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.600]   We believe the iPad 2 announcement, Leo LePorte here.
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.800]   Tom Merritt also here in the field with us today
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.760]   at the announcement to Sarah Lane.
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.880]   Andy Inako is in.
[00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.600]   Right now, the Urboblanes Center for the Arts, where--
[00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.600]   It's raining.
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.120]   It's raining at the Urboblanes Center.
[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.320]   A few minutes there.
[00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.320]   There she is.
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.080]   Hi, Sarah Lane.
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.760]   Hey.
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.200]   There is.
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.000]   We know that there's wine.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.840]   Not going to be the red on display, of course.
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.120]   So everyone, let's get you to that idea and don't expect it.
[00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.880]   But then there's some mumblings and grumblings.
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.360]   In the 11th hour last night, I know
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.880]   the business insider was reporting
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.640]   on a possible social networking kind of an aspect
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.960]   of the iPad.
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.600]   And possibly, I was 4.3.
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.400]   I have no idea what any of that means,
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.040]   but I'm excited about it.
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:12.600]   I'm hoping that given Apple's somewhat tumultuous first
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.760]   quarter in a working for the company anyway,
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.160]   that they come up with a bang.
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.400]   So we'll just have to see.
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.840]   I'll be following along with everybody else
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.160]   who got my laptop and my iPad in my pocket.
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.800]   So do we know if it was going to be our live stream?
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.280]   Or we just all jumped up?
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.360]   I'll just be refreshing and gadget like the rest of you.
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.360]   Leo, Tom, back to you guys.
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.160]   Thank you, Sarah Lane.
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.880]   Sarah is at the Urboblanes Center for the Arts.
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.120]   Sorry about that sound issue.
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.400]   We're going to start over again.
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.120]   Take two.
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.080]   Welcome to our live coverage of the March Apple event.
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.920]   What will most likely be an iPad 2,
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.680]   but we will find out in just a few minutes
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.200]   when Apple takes a stage in about 10 minutes.
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.680]   I'm Leo LaPorte joining me right now.
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:56.400]   Tom Merritt.
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.080]   Morning, Leo.
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.680]   Out at the event at the Urboblanes Center
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.840]   for the Arts in San Francisco,
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.080]   Sarah Lane and Andy Ennaco, who has already gone in.
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.640]   Sarah doesn't want to be seen.
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.080]   Andy Ennaco, who has already gone in,
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.560]   and will be covering it from the inside.
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.400]   We don't know yet if there's a live stream,
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.960]   but I don't think there is.
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.160]   Of course, we'll keep our eye peeled for that.
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.480]   And we also don't know exactly who's going to be live blogging,
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.960]   although I imagine it'll be the usual cast of characters,
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.560]   GDGT and Gadget Gizmodo.
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.840]   Actually, not Gizmodo, because they don't get invited
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:32.840]   to these events anymore.
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:33.520]   Not anymore.
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.040]   Not anymore.
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.440]   Not since they went to the--
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.920]   The Dark Side.
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:36.480]   The beer garden.
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.920]   Yeah.
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.560]   Andy is going to tweet from inside.
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.640]   So, Lisa, you just got to be sure of that.
[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.360]   I'd say there's a 98% chance we're
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.720]   going to get an iPad 2 announcement.
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.800]   No, big question is, what is it going to be?
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:48.880]   So what's your prediction?
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.320]   My prediction is, we'll get an iPad 2 announcement.
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.640]   It will be front and rear facing camera,
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.480]   slimmer, faster processor, maybe longer battery life,
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.200]   and available for pre-order immediately,
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.680]   but shipping in April.
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.080]   That's all guess.
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.920]   I agree 100% with you.
[00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.400]   There's no insider information there.
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.000]   No.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.240]   But I think it's completely reasonable.
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.600]   Don't expect a Retin display.
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:10.600]   No Retin display.
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.840]   Perhaps a higher resolution display, but I doubt it.
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.920]   I think you're to see what Apple will call the A5, which
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.920]   will basically be that dual processor core-text or arm
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:21.600]   design.
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.680]   ST-Carts slot?
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.840]   No.
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:27.160]   I don't think so.
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.360]   That one, I'd say there's closer to 50% chance, maybe 45%
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.440]   chance, but I don't think so.
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.080]   They don't like to do that.
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.160]   But there have been some credible case manufacturers out there
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.120]   saying, making cases with an SD card slot,
[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.920]   but they could just be guessing.
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.320]   They may not know at all.
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.960]   The question is whether we will get an iOS update.
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.560]   Will they talk about a new iOS?
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.560]   That might happen.
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.400]   And will we get any teases on anything else,
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.040]   like an iPhone 5, anything like that?
[00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.360]   If it gets a small percentage chance,
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.760]   but we might hear something.
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.680]   I've heard big rumors that the iOS 5, the next version of iOS,
[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.600]   will have some substantial changes
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.760]   and some real usability enhancements.
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.560]   I've heard this from people who are on the inside who say,
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.880]   you ought to see it.
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.040]   I don't think you're going to see thunderbolt in it.
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.400]   I don't think there's any reason for that.
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.200]   I think it should be a 30-pin connector USB.
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.440]   Well, and I think when thunderbolt is enabled on an iPad,
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.600]   it's going to be the 30-pin connector to thunderbolt.
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.800]   They're not going to get rid of that 30-pin connector.
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.520]   There's no reason for me to display point.
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.880]   Andy, we should say Andy Inako is inside.
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.320]   Here's his picture from inside.
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.320]   This is exactly what it looked like
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.360]   at the initial Apple iPad announcement.
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:40.160]   In the front row are Apple dignitaries, officials,
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.920]   people like the board, Al Gore's on the Apple board,
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.120]   people like that will be in the front row.
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.120]   Apple usually stacks these audience
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.120]   with a number of Apple employees for the applause lines.
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.640]   You could see the journalists,
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:55.120]   those are the ones with the laptops begin here
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.800]   in the third or fourth row.
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.080]   There's no laptops in the first few rows
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.840]   because those aren't journalists.
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:01.680]   Those are Apple people.
[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.000]   Those are the people who clap.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:03.840]   Yup.
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:04.840]   A lot of times people get confused,
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:06.480]   why are all the journalists applauding?
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:07.480]   That's not objective.
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:08.760]   It's not them, it's the employees.
[00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:12.120]   Yeah, I almost always make a point of not applauding,
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:17.000]   Steve's applause lines were there to be objective.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.080]   Behind where Andy is standing right now
[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.240]   to take this picture is a big row of cameras.
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.040]   So while Apple doesn't stream it live
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:27.680]   and well, I presumably don't allow it live streamed
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.680]   although again, I've never seen any restriction against that.
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.920]   Well, when I was at CNET, we would ask every time.
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:34.920]   Well, there was your mistake.
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:37.400]   Can we come do a live stream and they would say,
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.760]   no, you can send a camera, you can't stream it live.
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.760]   They invite the cameras in,
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:45.160]   but only for taping for later use.
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.520]   Beatles music is playing right now.
[00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:49.360]   Not a surprise.
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.160]   Apple, I think, made a deal with the Beatles
[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.700]   in order to get the Beatles on iTunes.
[00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:58.320]   So I'm not surprised to see that at all.
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.920]   Dicks are folks are there according to Mac rumors
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.320]   or Mac room. That's interesting.
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:03.160]   Yeah.
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.360]   So what blog do you wanna follow?
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.840]   I've got Macworld and Gadget open.
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.560]   I'll see if Ryan Bloch's doing his GDGT.
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.200]   Yeah, that's always a good one too.
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.040]   Before we go much further though,
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:17.320]   I would like to thank our friends at GoToMeaning.
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:20.680]   GoToMeaning is the place to go.
[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.760]   GoToMeaning.com to get the great online meeting software.
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:26.040]   Go to Meetings, the best.
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:28.400]   Most of us nowadays are working with people,
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:32.840]   clients, customers, colleagues, acquaintances
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:34.480]   that are spread out all over the country,
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.000]   all over the world.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.960]   An app developer in New Mexico and agency in New York,
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.680]   a project manager in London,
[00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:45.480]   a production company in LA or a Ireland,
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:47.720]   your programmers in Bangalore,
[00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:49.880]   your assembly line in Taiwan, how do you meet with them?
[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:51.800]   Well, you could fly there and I know people do,
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:55.600]   but that's a lot of time, a lot of money, a lot of stress.
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.560]   Why not meet with them online with GoToMeaning?
[00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.880]   It's as good as an in-person meeting.
[00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:01.400]   They have a great iPad app by the way,
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.440]   that means it's really simple.
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:07.960]   Even anywhere you can get Wi-Fi, even on the production floor,
[00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:09.600]   you can go down there and they can talk to you,
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:10.480]   you can have your meeting there.
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:11.680]   It's amazing.
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:13.560]   Everyone logs into GoToMeaning.com,
[00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:16.040]   even if they don't have the software.
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.600]   They get the software, it's about a minute later,
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.920]   they're ready for your meeting,
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:21.000]   which is good, you don't want clients
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:21.840]   to jump through hoops.
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:23.400]   Absolutely secure.
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:26.560]   Mac or PC, it's great for product reviews,
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:30.000]   for sales presentations, for training, for collaborating.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.880]   I use it all the time.
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:34.240]   We have several accounts.
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:36.480]   It's just the best, as John G. in our chat room says,
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:38.840]   GoToMeaning is the best way to do meetings period.
[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.240]   I agree.
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.960]   That's why I want you to try it free.
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:51.960]   For 30 days, go to GoToMeaning.com/Macbreak.
[00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:54.000]   Try it free for 30 days right now.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.360]   I know you'll like it.
[00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:01.280]   We continue with our live coverage of the iPad 2 announcement.
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:06.080]   We do have our camera at Live at the Erba Buena Center
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.720]   for the Arts where this announcement, as you can see,
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:10.200]   there's an apple and a lot of colored dots.
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.920]   That means absolutely nothing.
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:13.440]   It's pretty.
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:14.760]   They do a different one every time.
[00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:16.360]   It looks like a circus to me.
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:21.160]   The invitation that went out to the press
[00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:25.520]   had a calendar icon from iCal with the number two,
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:27.520]   which is today, March 2nd.
[00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:29.080]   But it could also mean iPad 2.
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:30.680]   And then it was peeled back a little
[00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:33.080]   and you could see the iPad behind it.
[00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:34.280]   So it was a dead giveaway.
[00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:36.400]   They're going to talk about the iPad.
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:42.040]   Some rumors that they might have a white iPad.
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:42.520]   Oh, right.
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:44.800]   We saw some pictures of white faces,
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:47.480]   but I don't know if I'd, you know, for the device,
[00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:49.680]   but I don't know if I'd believe that.
[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:52.280]   I think that's a very low possibility.
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:53.080]   It's possible.
[00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:55.080]   We haven't even seen a white iPhone yet, though.
[00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:56.240]   Right.
[00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:58.800]   So why, yeah, how would they be able to do that?
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.520]   It looks like GDGT is not doing live coverage.
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:02.880]   Johnny Ives is there.
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:05.200]   Jaws is there.
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:08.320]   Tim Cook, Phil Schiller, no sightings of Steve Jobs, though.
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:15.320]   Jaws is Greg Jawswiak, who is soft, is the OS 10 guy, right?
[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:16.080]   Yeah.
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:19.840]   And Josh Topolsky on the Engadget blog says he's just being Jaws.
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:20.680]   Which is what?
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:23.280]   I don't know.
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:25.560]   It's just Jaws being Jaws, man.
[00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:28.000]   Well, I'll let you cover it with the Engadget blog.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.760]   I'm going to, I'll probably do the Twitter thing.
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:31.320]   The nice thing, oh, that's good idea.
[00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:33.280]   The nice thing about the Macworld blog is they've got cover
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:34.920]   at live going, so it just automatically--
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:36.000]   I like freshes and get that.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.120]   --cepts it manually.
[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:39.480]   They're brave because last year at the iPad event,
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:40.560]   cover it live broke.
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.760]   And all the people who were doing live blogging
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:44.440]   at the iPad event last time.
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:47.040]   I'm sure Macworld and CNET and everybody else
[00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:49.120]   who used cover it live got on the phone to cover it live
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:51.640]   and said, hey, are you going to work?
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:54.200]   Well, I don't think we'll see the excitement about iPad 2
[00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.840]   that we saw about iPad 1.
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:57.600]   It was really an unknown quantity.
[00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:58.760]   Yeah, this is the follow up.
[00:10:58.760 --> 00:10:59.520]   This is the sequel.
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:00.720]   It's the sophomore year.
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:04.000]   And so we're not going to feel the same amount of excitement
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.240]   or expect a huge surprise, which is
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:08.800]   why I wonder if they won't spikes this up somehow
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:12.400]   with a separate announcement, with something maybe teasing
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:14.800]   a new iOS at the very least.
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:18.200]   I doubt we'll see anything like an Apple TV or even an iPhone
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:19.600]   5T's.
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.880]   But you think they'd want to do something
[00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:25.240]   to make this more press-worthy than just,
[00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:26.600]   here's the next iPad.
[00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:28.200]   Because to me, that's something they could send out
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:28.920]   in a press release.
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:30.400]   And we've got a front and rear facing camera
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:31.320]   and we've got a new process.
[00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:33.160]   Right.
[00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:36.720]   We are going to start this thing in about two minutes.
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:38.400]   Apple usually starts on time.
[00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:40.640]   I mean, they're very rarely late.
[00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:43.440]   Right now, I understand they're playing Beatles music.
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:44.200]   Robert Scobulls--
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:46.520]   They say they want a revolution.
[00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:47.640]   They want a revolution.
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:48.440]   Apparently, that's one of the--
[00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:52.440]   And Sarah Lane is out in front of the event right now.
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.240]   Andy has gone inside, as we mentioned.
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:55.120]   But Sarah's outside.
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:58.440]   And she's going to snag people as they come out.
[00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.600]   I'm hoping they'll do a demo room they usually do.
[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:04.360]   And if we can, Andy will either Skype or FaceTime to us
[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:05.320]   from the demo room.
[00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:08.360]   So I'm hoping that at the end of this event now or an hour
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:11.680]   and a half from now, we will have the first real pictures
[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:14.480]   of iPad 2.
[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:18.200]   Because that would be awfully nice.
[00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:21.360]   I'm keeping an eye on Apple's events page,
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:23.680]   apple.com/apple-events.
[00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:25.720]   That's where you have archived versions
[00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:27.320]   of all the previous announcements.
[00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:29.440]   And I don't see any indication they're going to be live.
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:31.000]   Weird because they streamed the last two events.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.120]   But I think that this event--
[00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:33.480]   I don't know.
[00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:36.120]   Maybe they want to keep the excitement alive.
[00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:39.080]   And maybe this is just a press conference.
[00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:41.160]   It's just an announcement.
[00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.360]   And they don't feel that this is a big enough event
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:44.440]   to warrant that kind of--
[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:45.640]   Not the case, of course.
[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:48.960]   It's the biggest event Apple does after the iPhone event,
[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:50.360]   right?
[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:50.800]   It is.
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:51.640]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:56.760]   But if it's just iPad 2, they may not want to oversell it.
[00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:58.520]   That's-- Apple's very good at sensing
[00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:03.120]   how to build the hype to the peak pitch.
[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:06.280]   Nintendo announcement going on right next door, by the way.
[00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:08.080]   Satoru Iwata, the CEO of Nintendo.
[00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:08.920]   Let's go to Sarah Lane.
[00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:10.840]   She's right out in front of the studio.
[00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:11.200]   And we can--
[00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:13.960]   Well, I'm watching the sweet live stream.
[00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:15.040]   So it was kind of funny.
[00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:16.880]   I was just sitting there going, look, it's Leo and Tom.
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:19.680]   And then I realized, oh, they're sort of tossing him in here.
[00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:21.880]   So we're still outside, here we're going to--
[00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:25.040]   right after we tossed back to the two of you gentlemen
[00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:28.600]   in the studio, an unnamed man, have no idea who he is
[00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:31.080]   or what he knows, came up to Lynn and I and said,
[00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:33.040]   I just saw Steve Jobs pull up on an asking Martin
[00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:34.520]   on the side of you, here we're going to right here.
[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:35.160]   Interesting.
[00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.760]   He didn't seem too crazy, but then again,
[00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:39.360]   could have been a lie, not sure.
[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:44.480]   That said, I did just see on Twitter that Ryan Block said
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:47.080]   he was kind of getting the feeling that Jobs was
[00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:47.880]   doing this thing.
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:50.840]   So if that's the case, I know it's going to make a lot of people
[00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:54.560]   happy and I know everyone's sort of hoping that's the case
[00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:57.320]   because it means he's feeling up for it.
[00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:01.000]   But as far as I know, I'm kind of just following along
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.080]   outside of you ever going.
[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:05.560]   So there's an element of excitement because we're here.
[00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:09.360]   But I'm literally doing what I could be doing from anywhere.
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:12.280]   So I'm in the same boat as the rest of you.
[00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:14.160]   I hope there's a live stream.
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:17.080]   Oh, hey, look, I can see myself on the twit.
[00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:19.000]   Yes, we're watching you, Sarah.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   That's like the piece.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.320]   All right, guys, I think this thing is about to start.
[00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:23.920]   So I'm going to toss it back to you.
[00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:25.640]   Let's hope for some good news.
[00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:26.560]   Thank you, Sarah Lane.
[00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:29.960]   She's at Erba Buena Center, where the Center for the Arts
[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.040]   were Steve Jobs.
[00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:35.760]   Perhaps we'll take the stage and talk about we think I had two.
[00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:37.680]   But again, anything's up for grabs.
[00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:39.480]   You might talk about OS 10 Lion.
[00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:42.040]   Everyone knows Steve Jobs drives a Mercedes CL class,
[00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:43.320]   not only Austin Martin.
[00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:43.720]   Right.
[00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:44.880]   I think it's BS.
[00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:45.160]   I think--
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:45.800]   But we'll see.
[00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:46.560]   That was BS.
[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:48.640]   Whether he's there or not, I think we don't know.
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:52.080]   But I think that guy was probably just full of it.
[00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:53.280]   Aston Martin.
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:54.440]   My Aston Martin.
[00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:55.440]   My Aston Martin.
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:15:02.760]   Keeping an eye out for--
[00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:05.840]   Oh, they've got a chair on stage, which Jason Snell
[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:08.960]   at Mackerel points out is the same chair they used
[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:10.360]   during the iPad launch last year.
[00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:11.680]   It was a comfy chair.
[00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:12.160]   Yeah.
[00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:17.400]   An iPad sitting and using chair, because they really
[00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:18.240]   want to emphasize--
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:20.440]   Yeah, they want the lean back sort of experience.
[00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:22.160]   Well, it gadgets down.
[00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:23.200]   You're kidding.
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:25.360]   Well, it was down for a couple of refreshes back now.
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:29.200]   I wonder if--
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:30.560]   let me look at some of the other sites.
[00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:31.880]   Ladies and gentlemen, our presentation
[00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:32.800]   will begin shortly.
[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.840]   Please switch devices to silent mode
[00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:36.320]   as just come across the--
[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:37.000]   And I wonder--
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:37.520]   The one.
[00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:38.960]   --are they saying stop using the Wi-Fi?
[00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:40.640]   Please turn off your Wi-Fi's.
[00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:41.160]   Yeah.
[00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:44.400]   That was a big problem, as most of you will remember.
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:45.840]   Lights are dimming.
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:48.840]   When they were doing the demo of--
[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:50.400]   what was that a demo of?
[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:51.320]   I don't even remember now.
[00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:55.320]   Yeah, which one was it?
[00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:57.200]   Was that an iPhone?
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:58.360]   Were you asked everybody to turn off the--
[00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:00.840]   I remember Google having trouble at Google I own shortly
[00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:01.800]   after that.
[00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:06.600]   I think it was an iPhone, because they wanted to show 3G.
[00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:07.240]   Yeah, maybe.
[00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:07.760]   Yeah.
[00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:09.840]   It's funny how quickly we forget.
[00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:11.200]   It was always FaceTime.
[00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:11.680]   That's right.
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:12.600]   That's what it was.
[00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:13.600]   It was-- thank you, chatroom.
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:16.960]   Of course, the chatroom knows.
[00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:19.520]   We're seeing Steve Jobs apparently.
[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:21.040]   We are?
[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:22.000]   Who's with the statroom?
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   Steve is on stage.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.480]   So a lot of applause for Steve Jobs.
[00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:27.560]   That is fantastic.
[00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:29.160]   Very glad to hear that.
[00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:31.520]   I think it's a good way of showing
[00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:32.960]   that he's just on medical leave.
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:33.800]   He's not dying.
[00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:34.640]   It's important.
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:35.080]   You know?
[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:37.360]   He wants to come out and say, hey, folks, I'm OK.
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:38.760]   I think that's fantastic.
[00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:40.760]   Big, big applause, of course he's getting.
[00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:46.440]   Standing-- oh.
[00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:49.720]   Here comes the sun was the last song they played right
[00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:50.440]   before he came on.
[00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:51.280]   Which one here comes the sun?
[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:52.120]   Yeah.
[00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:55.080]   And something great to announce today.
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.280]   Of course.
[00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:59.720]   So for those of you who are watching on video, of course,
[00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:02.640]   look at ours, Technica also having difficulty keeping
[00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:04.440]   their live stream up.
[00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:05.360]   So--
[00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:06.160]   Their live blog?
[00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:08.120]   Live blog up.
[00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:09.400]   Wow.
[00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:10.960]   And Gadgets got a picture of Steve.
[00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:14.320]   And he looks like the last time we saw him to me
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:14.920]   in this picture.
[00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:19.200]   It's interesting.
[00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:23.120]   There's so much interest in this that people just
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:24.800]   are bringing sites down right and left.
[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:26.320]   Starting out with iBooks.
[00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:28.200]   Yeah, they always start with numbers.
[00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:31.640]   And they're talking about the number of books downloaded.
[00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:34.000]   The iBooks Store.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.440]   17,000 new books coming to the Books Store from Random House.
[00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:40.360]   We heard that a couple of days ago.
[00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:41.360]   100 million books.
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:43.760]   2,500 publishers via iBooks Store.
[00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:45.120]   Does that include indies?
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:45.960]   Mostly.
[00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:47.800]   I mean, like individuals?
[00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:50.480]   Yeah, because not very few of the big ones.
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:52.040]   Big boys are on there.
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:53.040]   And Gadgets.
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:53.520]   Oh.
[00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:56.600]   Over 100 million books downloaded.
[00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:58.120]   Wow.
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:17:59.920]   Yeah, and Gadgets where I saw that picture.
[00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:02.440]   I will get a picture of Steve up on the screen for you
[00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:06.200]   from Engadget.com.
[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:07.560]   They are also live blogging.
[00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:17.080]   And we are going to keep bringing you the stuff
[00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:17.960]   as it comes across.
[00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:21.600]   But it comes across in dribs and drabs in different amounts.
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:23.480]   And we're not getting a live stream this year.
[00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:25.640]   So if anybody finds one out there, by all means,
[00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:27.200]   put it in the chat room.
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:29.920]   We are usually pirate live streams of something.
[00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:32.400]   Steve does look thin, but no different, as you said,
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:33.320]   from last year.
[00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:41.200]   If you can't watch the audio feed, maybe you have to go to work,
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:43.400]   or you're at work, and they don't want you watching video.
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:44.720]   We do have a live--
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:46.160]   I'm sorry, if you can't watch the video feed,
[00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:50.080]   we do have a live audio feed at twit.am.
[00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:53.120]   It requires an ice-cast compatible client, like Winamp.
[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:55.680]   That would work, or iTunes.
[00:18:55.680 --> 00:19:00.240]   Launch the URL twit.am/listen in most of those clients.
[00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:02.880]   And they'll automatically recognize the stream and begin it.
[00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:05.360]   Few more numbers, $200 million accounts created
[00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:08.320]   for the three stores, iTunes, App Store, and iBooks.
[00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:10.600]   And a total of $2 billion has been paid out
[00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:12.600]   from the App Store to developers.
[00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:14.160]   $2 billion with a B.
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:17.400]   $2 billion, yeah.
[00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:19.520]   Steve says, a lot of people try to copy this.
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:21.960]   I think we're way ahead.
[00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:23.720]   He says, we don't know Amazon's numbers,
[00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:27.360]   but we do believe we're bigger than Amazon, even on this.
[00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:29.120]   And now the iPhone, an update on the iPhone.
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:30.680]   And by the way, it says, lastly, now I
[00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:32.520]   don't know if that's ours, Technica, or--
[00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:34.360]   No, Mackerel says that too.
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:36.680]   I think lastly, in these updates--
[00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:38.440]   Before the big news.
[00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:40.320]   And it's all good.
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:42.000]   $100 million, the iPhone.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.040]   Personally, about the $100 million
[00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:44.840]   the iPhone should have got a little party or something.
[00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:47.240]   No kidding.
[00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:50.520]   You are 100 million the customer.
[00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:52.520]   So my guess is we're going-- and they've done this before.
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:54.800]   We're going to see Steve as MC, and he's
[00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:58.680]   going to hand it over to Tim Cook and Phil Schiller.
[00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:02.160]   And I think that's a great way to approach this.
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:04.160]   And it's nice for Steve to bring the good news.
[00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:05.160]   Yeah.
[00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:11.880]   And these Apple and Apple--
[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:12.360]   Here's the quote.
[00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:15.360]   Today we're here to talk about Apple's third post-PC
[00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:17.080]   blockbuster product.
[00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:18.880]   First was the iPod in 2001.
[00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:20.520]   I think you could fill in the gaps here.
[00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:22.000]   Second, of course, iPhone.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.840]   And in 2010, the iPad.
[00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:27.360]   So it is an iPad announcement of some kind.
[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:29.160]   And they're pointing out the most of the revenue
[00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:31.560]   comes from post-PC products.
[00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:33.560]   And that really has changed the character, in my opinion,
[00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:34.800]   the character of Apple Computer.
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:35.760]   It's really become about this.
[00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:37.560]   Well, that's why they're not called Apple Computer.
[00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:41.280]   They dropped the computer name very significantly.
[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:42.800]   This is following the template.
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:46.880]   We get numbers at the beginning, and then we ease into some
[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:48.600]   minor announcements, and then a major announcement.
[00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:52.000]   This is from ours Technica's live feed Steve Jobs on Stave
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.920]   Klendecker taking that picture for ours.
[00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:59.440]   He said magical, finally.
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:02.520]   Our most advanced technology in a magical and revolutionary
[00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:04.600]   device at an unbelievable price.
[00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:07.000]   Makes me a little angry that Apple requires people to do
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.520]   this kind of third-hand live blogging.
[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:13.240]   They're in effect streaming it live just by hand when Apple
[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:15.680]   could have sent the video out.
[00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:18.280]   Y'all, they even have a slide here that says our most
[00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:20.480]   advanced technology in a magical and revolutionary device.
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:21.680]   At a point in poking fun.
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:23.840]   He's like, people laughed at us for using the world magical,
[00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:26.840]   but we think it is.
[00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:30.080]   Now they're claiming 15 million iPads sold in 2010.
[00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:31.040]   That's a big number.
[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:31.800]   That is a big number.
[00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:34.320]   That's a huge three times what I predicted, and I thought I
[00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:35.520]   was being bullish.
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:36.680]   I thought you were too.
[00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:39.000]   I mean, at the time, I thought it was going to do better than
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.600]   most people thought, but I still didn't think it was going
[00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:42.600]   to do that well.
[00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:43.960]   And I still wonder why.
[00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:46.800]   I mean, I use it for a lot of things, but I don't see it as
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:50.280]   a replacement, as an incremental device that people have
[00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:51.320]   decided they need.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.640]   They've sold more than any tablet PC ever.
[00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:58.480]   I think that's--
[00:21:58.480 --> 00:21:58.880]   That's a safe bet.
[00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:00.040]   That was an easy bet.
[00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:02.080]   That was not a tall order.
[00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:03.600]   Not a difficult thing.
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:07.520]   9.5 billion in revenue.
[00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:10.760]   And Apple's most successful product ever,
[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:12.840]   according to Steve Jobs.
[00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:15.960]   And that, for whatever reason, that is why Apple is where
[00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:18.160]   it is today, is because they have topped themselves.
[00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:21.640]   The iPhone topped the iPod and the iPad has now topped the
[00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:24.000]   iPhone.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.320]   90% market share.
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:28.000]   And he says, Steve says, competitors are flummoxed.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.240]   Well, that's because there wasn't anybody in the
[00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:29.920]   marketplace.
[00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:31.080]   Or flummoxed.
[00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:34.200]   That's a great word.
[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:36.360]   Well, and they were because everyone said nobody wants a
[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:36.880]   tablet.
[00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:37.720]   Everyone's tried.
[00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:40.080]   Microsoft has been tammering at this.
[00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:43.640]   How are you going to get people to buy a tablet?
[00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:45.320]   And you see him everywhere.
[00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:47.760]   Oh, now he's talking trash about the Samsung Galaxy
[00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:48.160]   Tab.
[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:49.400]   Yeah, I saw that.
[00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:51.680]   That's interesting.
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:56.640]   He never liked that seven inch screen.
[00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:58.480]   Here's another picture of Steve.
[00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:01.920]   This is from the Engadget blog.
[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:09.040]   15 million iPads sold in 2010, more than every tablet PC ever
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:11.400]   sold $9.5 billion in 2010.
[00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:12.920]   90% market share.
[00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:13.760]   Competitors flummoxed.
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:15.480]   He actually put that on the slide.
[00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:22.960]   65,000 iPad specific apps.
[00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:27.560]   Now he's showing off some of the iPad specific apps.
[00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:30.680]   He's responding to a quote from Samsung that said, in terms
[00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:33.440]   of sellout, we believe it was quite small.
[00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:36.880]   Samsung disputed that later.
[00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:40.560]   So you can take that as you will, whether it was mis-
[00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:42.080]   translated or misquoted or not.
[00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:43.720]   It's interesting that Steve would feel even the need to
[00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:44.760]   mention that there is a little--
[00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:46.720]   Yeah, it is a little very rarely does Steve do that.
[00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:48.280]   In fact, I can't think of another time where Steve is
[00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:52.560]   mentioning a competitor that is not typical.
[00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:53.880]   Usually best not to mention him.
[00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:54.880]   It's just a free ad.
[00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:56.120]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:58.880]   And you end up probably looking worse than you would if he
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:23:59.400]   didn't.
[00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:05.880]   Now he's going to show off some iPad apps.
[00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:10.200]   It strikes me.
[00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:10.920]   He's just very silly.
[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:14.560]   I feel like we're doing a baseball game by Telegraph.
[00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:17.200]   It's just very silly that Apple--
[00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:19.440]   Yeah.
[00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:23.760]   That Apple requires reporters to do this silly stuff.
[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:25.760]   Well, that's why I was so pleased that they actually did
[00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:28.240]   stream the last couple, because I'm like, why wouldn't you?
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:28.760]   Why wouldn't you?
[00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:31.040]   If you're not going to let anybody else stream it yourself,
[00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:33.320]   that's perfect.
[00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:38.320]   Lots more self-congratulatory pros coming from Steve.
[00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:40.440]   There's never been anything like this.
[00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:44.200]   We're launched with thousands of apps, incredible, magical
[00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:45.040]   user interface.
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:47.760]   Our competitors trying to launch the most 100 apps.
[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:49.680]   Oh, and he shows the Honeycomb logo when he says that.
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:50.320]   He's being generous here.
[00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:53.120]   You know, that's not strictly--
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:54.680]   That's a stretch.
[00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:55.880]   That's a spin.
[00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:58.560]   Hundreds of Apple stores now, and that enables us to roll
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:24:59.960]   this technology out so fast.
[00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:04.280]   He's showing off the new Apple store in Chicago.
[00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:05.680]   They were built for moments like this.
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:07.320]   We have hundreds of Apple stores now.
[00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:09.760]   Without them, we wouldn't have been so successful.
[00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:12.320]   It is true that that has been that retail strategy has been
[00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:14.000]   a huge success for Apple.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:19.360]   And Microsoft quickly trying to copy it, rolling out stores
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:21.480]   in a lot of places right next to Apple stores.
[00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:24.240]   He's now showing a self-congratulatory video.
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:27.760]   Apparently, it's not working about how the year of the--
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:29.720]   2010 was the year of the iPad.
[00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:31.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:33.080]   That was the year of the rabbit.
[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:35.280]   Is the year of that?
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:35.560]   Oh, no.
[00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:36.280]   Now's the year of the year.
[00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:36.800]   Look at this.
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:37.440]   Look at this.
[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:38.840]   This is a Honeycomb beater.
[00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:40.120]   Yeah, the number 100--
[00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:43.960]   I have to say, I am frankly a little surprised.
[00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:47.840]   It shows that he's actually stung by the success of Android.
[00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:49.000]   I would say.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.560]   Phil Schiller taking the stage.
[00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:52.120]   Oh, no, I'm sorry.
[00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:52.640]   He's on the video.
[00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:54.400]   He's on the video, OK.
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:57.040]   No one predicted this was be as successful as it's been.
[00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:57.960]   That's true.
[00:25:57.960 --> 00:25:59.840]   In 10 years of retail, I've never seen anything
[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:01.960]   like the launch of the iPad, says Ron Johnson.
[00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:05.720]   Actually, it's true.
[00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:06.400]   It is true.
[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:07.520]   I mean, because we were just saying that.
[00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:08.600]   Even we didn't expect--
[00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:10.640]   You and I, being some of the more optimistic,
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:12.280]   didn't expect it to be nearly as good.
[00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:13.960]   And most people just thought it was going to flop.
[00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:15.880]   Dismissed it entirely.
[00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:18.960]   You're watching Breaking News coverage of Apple's March
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:19.320]   event.
[00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:22.200]   Now we know an iPad announcement to come.
[00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:23.640]   Our Breaking News coverage brought to you
[00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:27.000]   by our friends at Slingbox.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.800]   Slingbox available at Best Buy at Amazon.
[00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:30.800]   And learn more at slingbox.com.
[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:34.240]   Let's watch your TV anywhere, including on the iPad directly.
[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:40.520]   We will go into Mac Break Weekly right after this.
[00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:43.640]   I'm hoping that Andy will get a chance to Skype us or FaceTime
[00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:46.640]   us from the demo room and be able to give us a first look
[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:50.600]   at whatever new iPad is available.
[00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:54.720]   Engage it says, "The gist of the video, the iPad is magical."
[00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:55.320]   Yes.
[00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:56.240]   And revolutionary.
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:56.760]   That's all you need to know.
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:57.840]   Did I say revolutionary?
[00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:58.800]   I meant to say that.
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:00.720]   And we mean revolutionary.
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:11.160]   Of course, when we say 15 million iPads sold,
[00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:12.680]   let's put that in context.
[00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:15.800]   It's somebody in 4970, the chat room is pointing out.
[00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:21.600]   There were only 375 million PCs sold in that time.
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:24.160]   Of course, the iPad only had nine months.
[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:26.960]   So it would have been 20 million at that rate.
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:28.400]   Yeah, if you extrapolate.
[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:31.840]   But still, it's probably more than one computing device
[00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:33.160]   from one company.
[00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:35.320]   And it's probably more than all tablet PCs
[00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:37.240]   sold in the 10 years previous.
[00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:38.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:43.000]   I think that's a fairly safe guess.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.880]   They're just showing a lot of people using iPads now.
[00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:47.960]   It's a big celebratory iPad video.
[00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:56.400]   People in schools talking about the iPad and Chicago schools.
[00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:59.080]   Dan Morin at Macworld says, "It's strange that none of the people
[00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:03.440]   in this video appear to use cases on their iPads."
[00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:04.720]   I think the first thing Apple says
[00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:06.600]   is, can you take the iPad out of the case?
[00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:14.320]   This is the laggy part for us in reporting
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:17.480]   when we don't have a stream to show you, because it's--
[00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:18.800]   it's probably all very visual.
[00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:21.000]   So there's not a lot of information coming across.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:27.960]   Our own Andy and Aco, as I mentioned, is in the talk right now.
[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:31.640]   We can't talk to him directly because, of course, Apple forbids
[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:34.720]   that, but-- or we presume forbids that.
[00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:37.840]   But we will talk to him immediately after.
[00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:39.200]   And I'm hoping we will get a stream,
[00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:41.760]   if Apple doesn't prevent us from doing that, from the demo room
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:47.120]   so we can see this magical and revolutionary device in action.
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:50.320]   Now, the Salesforce CEO is on the video screen.
[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:55.040]   Yeah, they were showing a hospital, very sick people using iPads.
[00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:55.720]   That's actually true.
[00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:58.480]   I mean, I think that that's one of the big markets for iPads,
[00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:00.120]   is people who don't like or wouldn't
[00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:04.160]   use traditional computers, including older people, kids,
[00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:08.480]   little kids, really little kids sometimes.
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:10.120]   People who are ill or are bedridden.
[00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:19.320]   Rob's agent, our chat member, says, why don't you just call Andy
[00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:20.840]   and not say anything.
[00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:22.320]   I don't want to put Andy in the same position
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:24.560]   that I was in of getting banned for life.
[00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:26.880]   He has other outlets that he covers this for,
[00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:28.560]   including the Chicago Sun times.
[00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:30.960]   And frankly, I've tried that with other people.
[00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:33.080]   And when I worked at CNET, we're like, let's try this.
[00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:35.160]   And you can't get a good audio stream.
[00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:35.640]   You can't hear much.
[00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:38.640]   Yeah.
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:42.640]   We'll just live with Apple's restrictions.
[00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:50.640]   By the way, still in the video with lots of good examples
[00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:53.480]   of iPad doing good works in schools and hospitals
[00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:58.240]   and working with autistic kids, stuff like that.
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:02.280]   Yeah, Web 854 points out one of the stills from the video
[00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:05.680]   shows what looked like a white iPad in a hospital.
[00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:08.480]   I think it may have just been reflective
[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:10.880]   or had a cover or something like that.
[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:14.720]   So I know it's like there is--
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:16.120]   Somebody is streaming it on quick,
[00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:18.280]   so I'm not going to mention that.
[00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:20.200]   We'll just see what we can get.
[00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:24.040]   It looks like it's just a clip rather than the whole stream.
[00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:27.160]   Oh, let me know if that's how it would be.
[00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:28.200]   It is from the beginning.
[00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:29.760]   OK.
[00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:32.440]   Can you fast forward and get the--
[00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:33.360]   Well, let's at least see.
[00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:36.440]   This is Steve Jobs taking the stage moments ago
[00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:38.600]   to a standing ovation.
[00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:44.520]   This might be one moment where I would be applauding
[00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:47.120]   on my feet.
[00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:49.440]   Yeah, because you're not applauding some--
[00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:50.920]   Yeah, let's just try not to.
[00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:53.720]   It's good to see the guy up on his feet.
[00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:54.720]   Yeah.
[00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:59.360]   And we got something ready to announce today.
[00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:01.920]   Before we get to it, I've got a few updates.
[00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:04.520]   This is, by the way, about 15 minutes old.
[00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:07.440]   This is a quick video that somebody has shot.
[00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:09.040]   So at least we can see.
[00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:10.360]   Yeah, so that's it.
[00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:13.840]   Steve's back on stage now after the video.
[00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:17.720]   People are saying that a video is actually very emotional.
[00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:18.240]   Well, of course.
[00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:19.520]   Apple's brilliant at this.
[00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:22.360]   By the way, 2011, year of the copycats.
[00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:23.320]   That's a stage.
[00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:24.320]   I like it.
[00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:26.240]   I like it.
[00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:26.960]   He's probably right.
[00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:28.480]   Not the year of the rabbit.
[00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:30.640]   The year of the copycat.
[00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:31.440]   I think that's true.
[00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:32.800]   In fact, we saw that at CES.
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:37.640]   It was the tablet electronics show as a Cara Swisher.
[00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:39.360]   Now, that's the kind of snarky you can get away with,
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:41.760]   because it's just true.
[00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:45.040]   Everybody is trying to copy that success.
[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:46.760]   But Steve says, and now we're going to get to the meat
[00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:47.760]   of the matter.
[00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:50.080]   We aren't resting on our laurels.
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:51.640]   And gadget's now down, according to the--
[00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:54.880]   Today, they're introducing iPad 2.
[00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:56.160]   All right, so what is the name?
[00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:59.000]   We have a name, iPad 2.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.440]   All new design.
[00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:03.520]   Not tweaked, not marginal improvements.
[00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:06.120]   Completely new design.
[00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:09.200]   Designed to make your old iPad look obsolete.
[00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:09.920]   We're not making this up.
[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:10.840]   We're reading this up.
[00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:13.720]   But that part I made up.
[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:14.800]   First, it's faster.
[00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:16.720]   So we are getting a faster processor.
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:18.240]   That was to be expected.
[00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:21.400]   It's the A5, exactly as we called it,
[00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:25.920]   which will be based on the ARM A8 processor, probably
[00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:27.080]   a dual core processor.
[00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:28.960]   Yep, dual core.
[00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:31.160]   It'd be interesting to see what they do with a GPU,
[00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:34.400]   because of course, the Tegra 2 has the advantage of NVIDIA GPU
[00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:36.040]   hardware.
[00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:37.680]   Nine times faster graphics.
[00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:39.160]   Really gone all out in the graphics.
[00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:42.040]   Twice the CPU speed, nine times faster graphics.
[00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:43.280]   That's very interesting.
[00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:44.200]   What is the graphics?
[00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:45.680]   Same low power as the A4.
[00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:51.240]   So I'm looking at ours Technica right now.
[00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:53.760]   Tom is looking at Engadget and Macworld.
[00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:54.680]   And Macworld.
[00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:59.880]   It's funny how they both-- one of them seems to be faster,
[00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:01.280]   and then the other one gets ahead.
[00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:02.320]   They kind of go back and forth.
[00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:03.920]   Little shot at Motorola here.
[00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:06.400]   He says the first dual core tablet to ship in volume.
[00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:07.760]   I mean, the zoom is out.
[00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:09.320]   I don't know if it's shipping in volume.
[00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:11.040]   I don't know what that means.
[00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:12.600]   It's going to be a huge improvement.
[00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:16.920]   This is Jackie Chang writing for ours Technica right now.
[00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:18.840]   Dual-core processors, two times faster CPU,
[00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:20.440]   nine times faster graphics.
[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:22.960]   Same low power as A4.
[00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:25.680]   I would have to disagree about unless it comes out today
[00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:28.160]   that it is not the first dual-core tablet to ship in volume.
[00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:29.680]   The zoom is dual core.
[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:30.640]   Rear camera.
[00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:31.640]   Rear in front.
[00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:33.240]   Four videos, as Steve.
[00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:37.000]   Also built-in gyroscope.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.640]   The back is still metal.
[00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:40.160]   Jackie's looking at it right now.
[00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:42.160]   Everybody needs a gyroscope.
[00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:43.000]   Gyroscope.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.720]   Is that different from an accelerometer?
[00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:46.720]   Well, it's the accelerometer.
[00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:47.720]   Gyroscope gives you 3D.
[00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:48.720]   The compass.
[00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:49.720]   Yeah.
[00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:50.720]   Oh, OK.
[00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:51.720]   Not 3D, but three-dimensional.
[00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:52.720]   Three dimensions.
[00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:54.880]   Back and front camera.
[00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:55.880]   And dramatically thinner.
[00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:59.960]   And of course, again, this is exactly what one would have predicted.
[00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:06.160]   One being you, Tom Merritt, based on the information we have, but also on what just makes sense
[00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:08.840]   for Apple.
[00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:11.720]   One third the size of the iPad.
[00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:12.720]   Wow.
[00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:14.520]   No, I'm sorry.
[00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:15.520]   Take that back.
[00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:17.240]   One third thinner.
[00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:18.240]   That's slightly different.
[00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:21.160]   That makes a lot more sense, to be honest.
[00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:22.160]   One third thinner.
[00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:24.440]   One third the size would be a seven inch.
[00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:25.440]   Yeah.
[00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:26.440]   Which we know is useless.
[00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:28.680]   One third thinner is in, yeah, according to Steve Jobs.
[00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:31.120]   One third thinner is about the most you could do, in fact.
[00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:32.520]   Andy's got a live blog up, too.
[00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:33.520]   Does he?
[00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:34.520]   That did not go, Doctor.
[00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:35.520]   Oh, OK.
[00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:37.320]   8.8 millimeters thick.
[00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:40.520]   8.8 millimeters thick.
[00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:43.520]   That is thinner than the iPhone 4.
[00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:44.520]   Wow.
[00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:45.520]   OK.
[00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:48.080]   Yeah, I'm going to buy one.
[00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:49.080]   That's OK.
[00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:51.640]   You convinced me, Steve, right there on that one.
[00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:56.360]   There's the front facing camera.
[00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:57.360]   There's the thinness.
[00:34:57.360 --> 00:34:58.360]   Wow.
[00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:04.440]   Now, they're doing the little beveling that they do with the air to kind of make it appear
[00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:05.440]   thinner.
[00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:07.160]   I like the way that feels, too, when you hold it.
[00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:09.040]   I don't mind it.
[00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:10.040]   1.3 pounds.
[00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:11.880]   So it's actually lighter.
[00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:13.280]   And lighter.
[00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:17.960]   Front facing camera, back facing camera, A5 processor for dual core.
[00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:22.640]   The weight of the iPad has always been one of my issues in trying to hold it and read.
[00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:26.280]   I don't know that 0.2 pounds makes a lot of difference, Steve says it does.
[00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:28.800]   Well, it's certainly a complaint that people who use the kindles still.
[00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:29.800]   It comes in two colors.
[00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:30.800]   Uh-huh.
[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:31.800]   Maybe we do have a white.
[00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:32.800]   We have a white iPad.
[00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:35.720]   Black and white shipping from day one.
[00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:36.720]   No weight for the white.
[00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:37.720]   No weight for the white.
[00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:38.720]   All right.
[00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:39.720]   So that was one I didn't think was going to come true.
[00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:41.720]   That's kind of a surprise.
[00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:44.000]   Nothing approaches this.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:48.960]   Audience is laughing on the shipping from day one because they of course know that Apple
[00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:53.440]   also promised a white iPhone which never shipped almost a year ago.
[00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:55.480]   You know, it's just hilarious that people care.
[00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:56.480]   Right.
[00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:57.480]   Two colors.
[00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:58.480]   Do you really want to?
[00:35:58.480 --> 00:35:59.480]   I don't know.
[00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:00.480]   I don't know.
[00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:01.480]   There's a picture of it.
[00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:02.480]   White and black.
[00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:03.960]   I think AT&T and Verizon from day one as well.
[00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:04.960]   Oh good.
[00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:05.960]   That's big news.
[00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:08.200]   So Verizon does get iPad two.
[00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:10.640]   And the way he said it was there are models that work with.
[00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:12.240]   So we may not have a hybrid.
[00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:15.600]   We may have a CBM and a GSM.
[00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:16.680]   So there you have it.
[00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:20.840]   I don't detect a higher res display.
[00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:21.840]   But hard to tell.
[00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:22.840]   That's hard to tell.
[00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:23.840]   No evidence of that.
[00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:24.840]   No LTE.
[00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:26.840]   It will be 3G on Verizon only.
[00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:30.440]   Yeah, that makes much like the iPhone.
[00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:31.960]   Did not expect an LTE.
[00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:37.320]   Now they're claiming the battery life will not be any shorter.
[00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:38.320]   Here's from ours.
[00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:39.320]   Technically.
[00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:41.600]   But yeah, adding all this stuff something has to give.
[00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:42.840]   You think it'd be battery life.
[00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:44.640]   But it's not.
[00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:45.640]   That is classic.
[00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:46.640]   And it's still Steve talking.
[00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:48.520]   I want to point out Steve is there.
[00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:50.520]   He's doing it.
[00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:54.720]   That's very 10, 10 hour battery life as before.
[00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:58.480]   Same 10 hour battery life as before.
[00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:00.600]   One month of standby.
[00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:01.600]   This is this.
[00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:02.600]   But hasn't lost.
[00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:06.440]   That's his way of saying that the battery hasn't lost anything to try to make that
[00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:08.000]   sound like a positive.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.400]   You actually have no improvement in that area.
[00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:15.360]   So we're hearing now on our live breaking coverage of Apple's Spring event at the Erbobuina
[00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:16.680]   Center for the Arts.
[00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:19.720]   There is a new iPad iPad 2 one third thinner.
[00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:21.200]   A little bit lighter.
[00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:27.400]   Dual core processors, cameras front and back.
[00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:28.840]   Starting price again.
[00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:29.840]   499.
[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:30.840]   Look at that.
[00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:31.840]   And that is also not unexpected.
[00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:33.280]   So no price cut.
[00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:34.280]   That's pretty typical.
[00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:35.280]   Apple doesn't usually drop the price.
[00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:37.600]   It's going to be just as expensive as it was last year.
[00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:38.840]   That'll be for the Wi-Fi device.
[00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:41.960]   There will be Verizon devices as well as AT&T.
[00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:45.040]   1632 and 64 gig models.
[00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:46.840]   Same memory configurations.
[00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:48.840]   Yep.
[00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:53.200]   People were hoping I know for more memory but that frankly doesn't surprise me either.
[00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:57.040]   There's only so much NAND flash in the world that Apple can buy up.
[00:37:57.040 --> 00:38:00.480]   I still don't think you need to buy the 3G version.
[00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:05.160]   Now I had this argument and as people said no but we want to put movies and TV and oh
[00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:08.200]   I'm sorry you were talking about the not the memory size but the 3G.
[00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:13.600]   Yeah I do agree with going with the big memory but I don't think you need 3G.
[00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:16.480]   Here are the price points in full.
[00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:19.880]   It Wi-Fi goes from 4.99 to 6.99.
[00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:21.840]   Wi-Fi plus 3G.
[00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:23.920]   It's exactly the same as it was last year.
[00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:24.920]   6.29 to 8.29.
[00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:31.720]   So you pay a $120 premium for the 3G.
[00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:37.600]   So shipping on March 11th.
[00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:38.600]   There you go.
[00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:40.440]   Wow so a lot earlier than I expected.
[00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:41.440]   There you go.
[00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:44.200]   That is 8 days, 9 days from now.
[00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:45.200]   That's interesting.
[00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:47.120]   So presumably pre-order.
[00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:48.720]   Let's let me go to stored.apple.com.
[00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:49.720]   I'm curious.
[00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:50.720]   Yeah.
[00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:52.440]   It probably isn't up yet.
[00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:53.440]   Don't all go there.
[00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:54.440]   Yeah exactly.
[00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:55.440]   No.
[00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:56.440]   Still down.
[00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:57.440]   Please turn off your browsers.
[00:38:57.440 --> 00:39:00.760]   Don't all go there.
[00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:08.640]   But I have to say the thinness, the improved speed and the cameras especially video on
[00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:11.440]   the back which the iPod touch does it do video on the back.
[00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:13.480]   I think this is going to be dramatic.
[00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:17.320]   Now if you've been saying well what about an iPad 1 price drop.
[00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:19.360]   They have already started clearing them out of the stores.
[00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:22.480]   I don't think you'll see iPad 1s.
[00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:25.880]   They discontinued them and they were clearing out the stock over the last few days.
[00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:30.560]   Shipping March 25th in non-US countries like Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan
[00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:31.560]   and UK.
[00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:32.640]   Now he's moving on to accessories.
[00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:35.600]   So I think that that is the full lineup.
[00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:36.920]   Unless we get a one more thing.
[00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:37.920]   That's the big thing.
[00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:38.920]   That's the big deal.
[00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:43.480]   So they are going to do an A5 processor presumably based on the new arm, the dual core arm.
[00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:47.480]   They say they have improved graphics performance by how many times did they say?
[00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:48.480]   Nine times.
[00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:52.760]   Significant improvement in graphics performance.
[00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:53.760]   No new configurations.
[00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:58.800]   Here's the countries by the way that Australia, Canada, France, Germany and the UK will get
[00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:00.520]   it on the 25th.
[00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:01.520]   He says it's entirely redesigned.
[00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:03.480]   Frankly, these look like incremental.
[00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:08.200]   Accessory cable that delivers HDMI mirrored video output.
[00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:12.280]   Now if that's what I think it is, it means that we don't have to wait for an application
[00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:14.760]   to send data out the video port.
[00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:17.920]   We will be able to see 1080p.
[00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:19.120]   It works with all apps.
[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:22.600]   That means you'll be able to basically broadcast your iPad.
[00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:24.280]   That is I think something we all want.
[00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:25.280]   With a cable, yeah.
[00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:26.280]   With a cable.
[00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:28.840]   Well, for instance, your iPad today show, that's going to be a huge.
[00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:31.400]   Absolutely show you the iPad finally.
[00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:33.360]   This is something that even the iPhone still doesn't do.
[00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:35.760]   You can charge your iPad while using the cable.
[00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:36.760]   They see a mic.
[00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:38.560]   This is great.
[00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:39.400]   I lean order one.
[00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:43.720]   We need them for iPad today.
[00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:44.920]   There's a picture of the--
[00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:48.200]   Although this is one of those things where it's like, why didn't they have the-- you know,
[00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:49.880]   there's no reason they couldn't have this before.
[00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:51.480]   This isn't an advanced in technology.
[00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:53.080]   Yeah, it might be a chipset issue.
[00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:54.080]   Just a feature they added.
[00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:55.280]   39 bucks for that cable.
[00:40:55.280 --> 00:41:02.000]   This is probably something that the new graphics card allows that wasn't allowed previously.
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.480]   Makes it so that it doesn't hurt the battery.
[00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:05.200]   Certainly, 1080p is new.
[00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:07.000]   It wasn't able to do 1080p before.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.080]   You needed a better GPU.
[00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:10.640]   Probably a better CPU as well.
[00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:12.640]   Which one do you want?
[00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:13.840]   Well, let's get the Wi-Fi.
[00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:15.400]   No, I don't want white.
[00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:17.880]   What are smart covers?
[00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:19.240]   I've said smart covers.
[00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:21.120]   They said something about that must be the next time.
[00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:22.120]   There's a smart cover.
[00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:23.120]   What is that?
[00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:24.720]   So there's the dongle.
[00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:25.720]   That's the HDMI dongle.
[00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:29.040]   That's the dongle, which gives you-- you see a 30-pig connector and HDMI.
[00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:30.960]   It looks like full HDMI, not mini HDMI.
[00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:32.960]   So you can charge it with that charge that you want.
[00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:33.960]   That's great.
[00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:41.680]   That actually-- that really broadens the potential applications for-- is CNN live streaming this?
[00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:42.680]   Is that true?
[00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:47.600]   Smart covers apparently are thinner than cases, so it allows you protection without adding
[00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:49.320]   weight to the product.
[00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:52.320]   Oh, well, that's smart.
[00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:57.200]   But there's a cover to cover the glass.
[00:41:57.200 --> 00:41:58.200]   Life ends.
[00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:00.520]   It bends and folds around.
[00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:02.440]   There are some Ustream live streams now.
[00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:08.360]   So somebody else is going to get banned.
[00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:13.200]   So this time they designed the cover-- the case, they're calling it a cover right alongside
[00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:18.160]   the iPad so that it isn't as bulky and weird.
[00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:21.640]   And it still works as a typing statement.
[00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:23.640]   Is that-- can I help?
[00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:26.920]   Oh, it's an ad.
[00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:27.920]   Great.
[00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:28.920]   Thank you, Google.
[00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:30.920]   Get out of there.
[00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:31.920]   Get out of there.
[00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:36.480]   He's got 6,000 viewers on this pirated live stream.
[00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:38.520]   And I'm sure Google's happy about them all watching the ad.
[00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:43.880]   The new cover uses magnets to adhere to the iPad.
[00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:45.520]   Is that-- well, I guess it's Flash memory.
[00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:46.520]   It doesn't matter.
[00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:48.320]   I always get weird about magnets around the computers.
[00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:51.760]   I don't like magnets.
[00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:55.200]   They grasp an auto-align so it's always in perfect alignment.
[00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:58.640]   Third part of the case is always better anyway.
[00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:00.640]   Oh, this is a guy--
[00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:02.640]   So right now, I already tell you this.
[00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:03.640]   This is great.
[00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:05.720]   They got the price point.
[00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:11.440]   This guy is doing his own commentary with video that he's getting from somewhere else.
[00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:13.440]   Looks like he's getting it from a gadget.
[00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:14.440]   Mm-hmm.
[00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:16.000]   They're going to have to meet that price point.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:17.400]   I love it.
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:18.400]   So where-- Bravo.
[00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:19.400]   I don't know who that is.
[00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:20.400]   He's got 60s.
[00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:21.640]   He's got more viewers than we do.
[00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:22.640]   So he's using-- So he's using--
[00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:24.880]   He's using the images from GenGAD.
[00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:26.840]   I don't know what that live video stream is.
[00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:30.640]   I don't know what he's doing, but he's doing a better job than we are.
[00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:31.640]   Good for him.
[00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:32.640]   Let me see what else we can get.
[00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:34.800]   There is apparently another fee that Justin--
[00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:36.720]   If he had a CNN is feeding it live.
[00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:42.440]   I don't know how CNN is doing that.
[00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:43.440]   Maybe this is just one more time.
[00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:44.440]   Now they're going to show--
[00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:45.440]   Steve Jobs to screw me.
[00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:48.640]   They're showing a video on how the third party case works.
[00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:49.640]   So we're--
[00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:51.640]   You're not missing a ton right now.
[00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:52.640]   Yeah.
[00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:55.440]   It comes in polyurethane or leather.
[00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:57.440]   Mm-hmm.
[00:43:57.440 --> 00:43:59.080]   So this is something Apple's going to sell.
[00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:01.080]   Yeah, this is so much money on their case.
[00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:06.440]   They made so much money on their case last year on their pathetic case.
[00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:07.440]   I find it fine.
[00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:09.040]   I don't know why you hate it so much.
[00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:11.840]   I mean, it's not-- I'm not unwaving about it.
[00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:12.840]   You're using it.
[00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:14.400]   It just seems overpriced for a piece of rubber.
[00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:15.400]   I'll give you that.
[00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:16.400]   That money's long gone.
[00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:18.400]   I don't like the weird edge.
[00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:21.400]   But this thing that sticks out on the edge of that thing.
[00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:22.400]   What's that all about?
[00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:23.400]   Yeah, it hurts my hand.
[00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:24.400]   Yeah.
[00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:25.400]   I don't get that.
[00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:31.400]   The video is mostly showing a hand folding up and down the cover.
[00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:35.400]   They put more energy into the other video, I think.
[00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:36.400]   Okay.
[00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:37.400]   Smart cover.
[00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:38.400]   That's good.
[00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:39.400]   It's smart.
[00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:40.400]   It's a cover.
[00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:43.400]   Steve likes the video so much.
[00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:47.400]   He says it's reminding him of Pixar's short.
[00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:51.400]   Microfiber lining cleans the screen while it's closed.
[00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:52.400]   That's smart.
[00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:55.400]   That's actually very smart because that's one of the things people complain about.
[00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:57.400]   But the iPad is it gets so smudgy.
[00:44:57.400 --> 00:45:00.400]   The magnets are in the iPad itself.
[00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:01.400]   What?
[00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:02.400]   Really?
[00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:05.400]   And there's magnets in the hinge of the smart cover.
[00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:09.400]   This is Apple saying you're going to buy our cover.
[00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:10.400]   Uh-huh.
[00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:16.080]   You're going to buy our cover.
[00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:21.120]   And the leather one will be more expensive than the polyurethane, which will also be overpriced.
[00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:22.120]   Have they named a price yet?
[00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:23.120]   Oh, here we go.
[00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:25.120]   Polyurethane $39 leather case $69.
[00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:26.280]   Yeah, it's a little overpriced.
[00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:29.680]   Five polycolor colors, five leather colors.
[00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:33.000]   I always think blue leather is just an abomination personally.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:36.240]   Well, you know you're going to go for the leather one.
[00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:37.440]   Oh, yeah.
[00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:39.200]   I want brown leather.
[00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:40.600]   I want it to look like a cow.
[00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:42.640]   We think people are going to love these cases.
[00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:44.720]   Of course we do.
[00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:46.320]   We're going to love you when you buy them.
[00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:48.040]   Ah, now we're talking about iOS 4.3.
[00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:49.840]   Ah, that's okay.
[00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:51.600]   So there's some substance left.
[00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:53.120]   So CNN's really got it live?
[00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:55.160]   Mm, I can't bring it up.
[00:45:55.160 --> 00:45:57.440]   On TV or on web?
[00:45:57.440 --> 00:45:58.440]   There's a stream.
[00:45:58.440 --> 00:45:59.440]   There's a stream.
[00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:02.680]   Somebody, I mean the chat room's claiming it, but I can't get it to the...
[00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:04.080]   It's so smart, I'm sure.
[00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:05.880]   So here comes Scott Forestall on the stage.
[00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:08.400]   He's going to talk about iOS 4.3.
[00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:10.040]   Getting enhancements and new features.
[00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:11.040]   That's cool.
[00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:13.680]   CNN is at the late, 15 minutes late feed.
[00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:14.680]   That's probably what Apple is.
[00:46:14.680 --> 00:46:15.680]   It's a lot.
[00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:16.680]   Really?
[00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:17.680]   Yeah.
[00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:18.680]   Really?
[00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:19.680]   Yeah.
[00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:20.680]   Apple.
[00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:21.680]   Really?
[00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:22.680]   Really?
[00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:23.680]   It's like, I don't even understand.
[00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:24.680]   I can't even think of what they're watching.
[00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:25.680]   Why would you?
[00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:26.680]   I can't.
[00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:29.320]   I mean, they're sitting here making us do telegraph baseball.
[00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:32.280]   Scott Forestall is coming out on stage.
[00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:33.280]   [laughs]
[00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:34.280]   [claps]
[00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:38.800]   Reenactment.
[00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:42.800]   This reenactment brought to you by our friends at Slingbox.
[00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:45.960]   As always with our breaking news coverage, Slingbox is the thing.
[00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:51.840]   You can watch your home TV on your iPad or your iPod Touch with Wi-Fi, laptop, any smartphone.
[00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:57.400]   Go to slingbox.com and find out more and you can pick up a Slingbox at Best Buy and Amazon.com.
[00:46:57.400 --> 00:47:02.240]   We thank Slingbox for their support of our live news coverage.
[00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:08.680]   They claim that iOS 4.3 will run JavaScript two times as fast as they've taken the nitro
[00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:12.400]   JavaScript engine from OS 10 and moved it on to iOS.
[00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:16.120]   All of your music, movies, TV shows that are stored in iTunes and your computer can be
[00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:20.320]   watched directly on your iOS device.
[00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:23.800]   Wireless streaming.
[00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:26.240]   I guess this is using AirPlay, I'm not sure.
[00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:27.240]   It must be.
[00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:31.560]   Wireless streaming over your home Wi-Fi network from your computer to your iPad, iPhone, and
[00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:32.560]   iPod Touch.
[00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:33.560]   That's actually pretty fantastic.
[00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:35.520]   This makes a great portable TV device.
[00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:39.840]   Now you'll be able to watch Slingbox when you're on the robe, when you're at home, you
[00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:42.000]   can watch whatever is on your...
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:43.920]   So this is just like Apple TV, right?
[00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:46.320]   Yeah, basically turns it into an Apple TV, doesn't it?
[00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:49.920]   That's pretty cool.
[00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:50.920]   So you can go...
[00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:51.920]   It's really two-way.
[00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:55.800]   AirPlay gets iOS to your TV and this is kind of reverse backwards airplane.
[00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:57.280]   Yeah, right.
[00:47:57.280 --> 00:47:59.360]   Your iPad becomes a television.
[00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:00.360]   Right.
[00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:04.600]   Just like with Slingbox app.
[00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:06.800]   Yep.
[00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:10.280]   So we're going to bring Lisa Bettany and she's here to join us for our Mac Break Weekly,
[00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:11.280]   which we'll begin soon.
[00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:16.560]   Actually, we'll probably begin Mac Break Weekly when Andy comes out and if Andy can get into
[00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:20.720]   the demo room.
[00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:23.040]   So AirPlay, even better in iOS 4.3.
[00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:27.160]   If you're sharing photos, you can now use all of the cool built-in slideshow transitions
[00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:29.760]   from Apple TV on your iPad.
[00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:33.280]   Also now apps, oh, this is big.
[00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:34.280]   Let me repeat that.
[00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:35.280]   Yes, say that again.
[00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:41.320]   Apps and even websites can AirPlay Play, AirPlay Video in addition to audio.
[00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:43.960]   Apps and even websites can AirPlay Video.
[00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:50.040]   That means you could have a Hulu app, airplane to your TV from your iOS device.
[00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:54.680]   So this is in effect adding apps to the Apple TV, something we've wanted for some time.
[00:48:54.680 --> 00:49:00.480]   And with HDMI, this is really turning the iPad into a home theater PC.
[00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:02.160]   Very interesting.
[00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:09.040]   So Al Jazeera English app, for instance, could just be transferred to my television.
[00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:10.560]   And I can watch that.
[00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:11.560]   Right.
[00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:12.560]   The BBC Radio app.
[00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:13.880]   Could go right to my speakers.
[00:49:13.880 --> 00:49:14.880]   Right.
[00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:15.880]   Right.
[00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:17.200]   So this is very interesting.
[00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:21.640]   This is essentially adding apps to the Apple TV.
[00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:27.440]   I think that that's-- it kind of explains why they didn't do that in the first place now.
[00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:28.440]   Right.
[00:49:28.440 --> 00:49:29.840]   You're just going to toss them across the network.
[00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:30.840]   Yeah.
[00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:35.040]   That makes a lot of sense.
[00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:37.400]   Personal hotspot only works on iPhone 4.
[00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:40.400]   Let's you share your iPhone's 3G connection over Wi-Fi to other devices.
[00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:42.440]   That was available on the Verizon iPhone.
[00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:43.440]   Right.
[00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:49.000]   So I think they're just saying that's coming to all iPhone devices in iOS 4.3.
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:56.120]   Oh, you can now use the slider switch for mute or rotation.
[00:49:56.120 --> 00:50:00.960]   There will be a user-settable preference in iOS 4.3.
[00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:04.240]   That doesn't sound like a big deal to anyone who doesn't use that.
[00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:09.680]   But if you do use it, I hated it when they took that away because I liked that lock.
[00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:12.360]   And I will definitely switch that back.
[00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:15.480]   I kind of thought they'd do that.
[00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:18.960]   And they've got new software to take advantage of the cameras on the iPad starting with
[00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:22.240]   photo booth.
[00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:30.200]   That makes sense.
[00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:35.720]   You're watching live coverage of Apple's announcement.
[00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:41.840]   And yes, it is an iPad 2 just to recap running a new A5 processor, dual-core processor with
[00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:43.840]   improved graphics performance as well.
[00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:49.640]   In fact, Steve says nine times faster, same battery life, same price point, but one-third
[00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:50.640]   thinner.
[00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:53.200]   It will come in white and black.
[00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:58.920]   It will be available March 11th in just a little more than a week.
[00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:02.400]   So this is and some and now we're hearing some very interesting improvements before three.
[00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:03.400]   Does he say one four three?
[00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:04.400]   He'll be available.
[00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:05.560]   Now we haven't got that yet.
[00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:08.000]   Lisa Bettany is now joining us in the studio.
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:09.000]   Hi, Lisa.
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:10.000]   It's great to see you.
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:11.000]   Well, I just I filled you in.
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:12.000]   I filled you in.
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:13.000]   Is that all?
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:14.000]   I'm excited.
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:15.000]   Yeah.
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:17.480]   I'm really excited.
[00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:19.520]   Cameras front and back and they say video cameras.
[00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:21.600]   They didn't give us specs on the.
[00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:26.800]   That is really honestly when when the original iPad came out, that's I poo-pooed the iPad
[00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:28.160]   because it didn't have a camera.
[00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:34.240]   So I'm really excited to have that because I use I haven't been using it as much as I
[00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:36.960]   would if it had a camera.
[00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:39.960]   I'm just envisioning people taking pictures with it though.
[00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:40.960]   It's kind of bulky.
[00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:43.640]   I have to take pictures of the Samsung and it's kind of weird.
[00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:44.640]   Yeah, it's a little bit.
[00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:45.640]   It's like a giant camera.
[00:51:45.640 --> 00:51:48.320]   It feels like a kid camera.
[00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:52.640]   But you bought to to its advantage, you really could see what you're taking a picture of
[00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:54.160]   because it is a big screen.
[00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:55.640]   Yeah, no, amazing.
[00:51:55.640 --> 00:52:01.600]   And obviously to to be able to FaceTime and I use Skype a lot using a video.
[00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:02.760]   So that will be.
[00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:05.760]   Steve's about to actually Scott's about to talk about FaceTime for the iPad.
[00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:10.560]   By the way, he says Facebook is a photo booth rather is incredibly fun on the iPad too.
[00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:11.560]   And I guess so.
[00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:12.560]   It's fun on the Mac.
[00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:15.280]   It's odd that he would think that.
[00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:17.200]   But that makes sense if you're going to put a camera in.
[00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:18.800]   Of course, you put photo booth on it.
[00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:23.000]   FaceTime between two iPads, between an iPad and an iPhone iPod touch, between an iPad
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:24.000]   and a Mac.
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:25.000]   This is silly.
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:26.000]   This is like a photo booth.
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:32.080]   Tom is using the new laptop and they now call it the FaceTime HD camera, not the iPad
[00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:33.080]   side anymore.
[00:52:33.080 --> 00:52:34.080]   Oh, what?
[00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:35.080]   And it's much higher resolution.
[00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:36.640]   It'll now do 720p.
[00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:37.640]   Right.
[00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:44.280]   So you're FaceTiming with somebody from the new MacBook to somebody with equivalent capabilities.
[00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:46.000]   You should get much better video quality.
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:47.000]   Have you tried it?
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:48.000]   I haven't tried.
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:50.400]   I haven't had a chance to try it because I just launched it this morning.
[00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:51.400]   I finished the data transfer.
[00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:52.400]   Oh, look.
[00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:53.400]   Photo booth.
[00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:54.400]   Mic right up there.
[00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:55.400]   Yawn.
[00:52:55.400 --> 00:52:56.560]   I just noticed the mic is up by the camera.
[00:52:56.560 --> 00:52:58.200]   Well, that's where it should be, right?
[00:52:58.200 --> 00:52:59.200]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:00.800]   Scott Forest all demonstrating.
[00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:02.040]   This is now I'm not sure.
[00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:03.600]   I'm not clear if this is for three.
[00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:06.440]   He's demoing or this has now gone back to the.
[00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:09.040]   This is new software to take advantage of the camera.
[00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:10.400]   So they're back into the iPad.
[00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:12.400]   Will the iPad ship with four three?
[00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:14.080]   I guess it will.
[00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:15.840]   They haven't made that clear yet.
[00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:17.840]   No.
[00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:22.200]   And I don't know if this stuff comes on iPad or if it's apps that they'll be making available
[00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:23.200]   to the app.
[00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:32.960]   I think the huge deal to have this I AirPlay sharing apps, video back, the HDMI cable,
[00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:38.160]   I think turns this in some ways into a home theater iPad.
[00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:40.200]   And that's why you can charge with the HDMI cable.
[00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:43.720]   They announced a $30 HDMI cable that mirrors the display.
[00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:47.000]   So anything that's going on in your iPad will be seen on your TV.
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:49.520]   It'll charge at the same time as you've got the HDMI hooked up.
[00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:52.240]   So that means you sit it next to the TV.
[00:53:52.240 --> 00:53:53.680]   It's almost is Apple TV.
[00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:54.680]   You can run apps.
[00:53:54.680 --> 00:53:56.960]   Of course, you won't be able to control it.
[00:53:56.960 --> 00:53:59.680]   You'd have to actually kind of reach for it and have a cable.
[00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:02.840]   That would be your remote control.
[00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:03.840]   I guess.
[00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:04.840]   Yeah.
[00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:05.840]   It's a very expensive remote control.
[00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:06.840]   Yes.
[00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:07.840]   But it has to be connected.
[00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:08.840]   You know, it's not wireless.
[00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:09.840]   Yeah.
[00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:10.840]   It's not wireless.
[00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:13.240]   So were you surprised that the price didn't go down?
[00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:14.240]   Yeah.
[00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:15.240]   Well, I'm not shocked.
[00:54:15.240 --> 00:54:16.240]   No, no, no, no.
[00:54:16.240 --> 00:54:17.240]   Apple always does this.
[00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:18.240]   This is exactly what they do.
[00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:19.240]   They improve.
[00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:21.160]   They've done this from time immorale.
[00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:22.160]   They keep the prices same.
[00:54:22.160 --> 00:54:23.560]   They give you more bang for your buck.
[00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:25.240]   I wouldn't say surprised, but disappointed.
[00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:27.040]   Yeah, a little bit.
[00:54:27.040 --> 00:54:30.040]   What you thought maybe competition for the tablets was going to drive that price down.
[00:54:30.040 --> 00:54:31.040]   I just didn't say that.
[00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:32.760]   I put it as hope rather than thought.
[00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:33.920]   Yeah, Apple doesn't work that way.
[00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:34.920]   Apple has to work that way.
[00:54:34.920 --> 00:54:39.520]   4-3 will come out March 11th with concurrent with the new iPad.
[00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:42.160]   It's exciting.
[00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:46.800]   So that means presumably they'll push it out to the iPhone because some of these improvements
[00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:47.800]   were iPhone specific.
[00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:51.480]   Yeah, it's all iPads, iPhones, and third and fourth generation iPod touches.
[00:54:51.480 --> 00:54:54.920]   He said iPhone GSM though.
[00:54:54.920 --> 00:54:56.480]   Free download March 11th.
[00:54:56.480 --> 00:54:58.600]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:54:58.600 --> 00:55:03.840]   So iPad GSM iPhone and iPhone 3GS and third and fourth generation touch.
[00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:06.960]   That means no Verizon update.
[00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:09.480]   Oh, dear.
[00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:13.080]   But Verizon already has some of those features, but that's weird that there's off-cycle.
[00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:14.440]   Oh, dear.
[00:55:14.440 --> 00:55:16.440]   Oh, dear.
[00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:17.440]   More.
[00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:20.320]   Steve has come back on stage and asked Scott Forest all leaving the stage and he's going
[00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:22.760]   to show some more apps, some new apps.
[00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:25.080]   I movie for iPad.
[00:55:25.080 --> 00:55:26.080]   Oh, of course.
[00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:27.480]   That's a great product.
[00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:32.280]   Yeah, finally, like that the iPhone version not so hard to use, but still cool that you
[00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:33.280]   could do it.
[00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:34.280]   Yeah, very cool.
[00:55:34.280 --> 00:55:36.480]   But if you have a bigger screen, you can do some actual editing.
[00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:40.120]   So photobooth and FaceTime come with iOS 4.3, it sounds like.
[00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:41.120]   Yes.
[00:55:41.120 --> 00:55:42.120]   The way they're presenting this.
[00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:43.120]   Is that right?
[00:55:43.120 --> 00:55:44.120]   I'm getting in line actually.
[00:55:44.120 --> 00:55:48.680]   I have to say, there's enough significant improvements.
[00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:55.800]   The camera, the software, the fact that it mirrors.
[00:55:55.800 --> 00:55:58.840]   I movie is apparently coming independently of iOS.
[00:55:58.840 --> 00:56:01.760]   Yeah, they'll charge five bucks or whatever.
[00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:07.920]   I can see a lot of new apps bringing up like photobooth type apps.
[00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:08.920]   Right.
[00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:11.920]   Taking a daily shot of yourself, that kind of thing.
[00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:12.920]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:13.920]   People are like.
[00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:15.920]   Well, that's what you're doing with mostly 365, right?
[00:56:15.920 --> 00:56:16.920]   Kind of, yeah.
[00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:17.920]   And it's not self-portraits.
[00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:21.000]   I see a lot of more self-portraits.
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:24.040]   I see a lot more of that kind of thing happening.
[00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:25.040]   I don't know.
[00:56:25.040 --> 00:56:29.480]   I'm wondering how people are going to use this as an actual camera.
[00:56:29.480 --> 00:56:32.240]   I think it's more for video conferencing and that sort of thing.
[00:56:32.240 --> 00:56:33.240]   Yeah.
[00:56:33.240 --> 00:56:36.160]   Well, one thing we don't know yet is what the resolution of the camera is, what the capabilities
[00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:38.440]   are, whether it'll shoot 720p video.
[00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:46.240]   But if it shoots 720p video, which I'm guessing it's going to, that makes it a very interesting
[00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:47.240]   product.
[00:56:47.240 --> 00:56:48.240]   Yeah.
[00:56:48.240 --> 00:56:50.080]   Yeah, it does.
[00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:54.520]   I mean, definitely the limitations of the front-facing camera on the iPhone.
[00:56:54.520 --> 00:56:58.360]   It's been something I've been pretty disappointed in.
[00:56:58.360 --> 00:57:04.720]   But if they've done something to improve that, and then obviously we have iPhone 5 hot on
[00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:09.080]   the tail of this, so it'll be interesting to see what this brings out.
[00:57:09.080 --> 00:57:12.440]   New UI for iMovie on the iPad.
[00:57:12.440 --> 00:57:13.440]   That makes sense.
[00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:15.520]   Might as well take advantage of that screen real estate.
[00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:20.720]   When you launch it, it comes up in movie poster format with thumbnails.
[00:57:20.720 --> 00:57:24.800]   They will update it for the iPhone 4 and iPod touch as well.
[00:57:24.800 --> 00:57:26.400]   The interface is a universal app.
[00:57:26.400 --> 00:57:27.400]   Yeah.
[00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:30.040]   Timeline down below.
[00:57:30.040 --> 00:57:35.080]   Randy Ubeos, chief architect of video, is on stage right now.
[00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:37.480]   Talking about this.
[00:57:37.480 --> 00:57:46.400]   So iPad 2, March 11th, concurrent with that, a free update for all iOS devices to 4.3 with
[00:57:46.400 --> 00:57:50.920]   some interesting new features, including kind of two-way airplay.
[00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:57.720]   So now you'll be able to broadcast app video to your television, which means if presumably
[00:57:57.720 --> 00:58:02.600]   if you had Hulu Plus on your iPad or iPhone, you'd be able to put that on the TV.
[00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:03.600]   I need a TV.
[00:58:03.600 --> 00:58:04.600]   You know what that's going to be though.
[00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:05.600]   It's going to be app by app.
[00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:10.240]   Each app and Hulu won't activate that.
[00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:11.440]   They could probably disable it, sure.
[00:58:11.440 --> 00:58:13.760]   They'll probably say, "I'm not going to allow that with this app."
[00:58:13.760 --> 00:58:14.760]   Right, yeah.
[00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:15.760]   No, they do that.
[00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:19.680]   Because that's the whole point of Hulu Plus is it's mobile, not big screen.
[00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:21.040]   Not your TV.
[00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:22.360]   Even if I'm paying 8 bucks a month.
[00:58:22.360 --> 00:58:23.360]   Yes, I know.
[00:58:23.360 --> 00:58:24.360]   Isn't that ridiculous?
[00:58:24.360 --> 00:58:26.880]   I'm just guessing that.
[00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:31.520]   Still getting a demo right now of the new iMovie 4 iPad and iPhone.
[00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:37.080]   There's a precision editor, which it does need, of course, with pinch full control over transitions.
[00:58:37.080 --> 00:58:38.080]   Tap on a clip.
[00:58:38.080 --> 00:58:41.280]   You get handles to choose a segment of the clip you want to include.
[00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:44.560]   There's a camera button on the right that lets you use the iPad to his camera to record
[00:58:44.560 --> 00:58:45.560]   real time.
[00:58:45.560 --> 00:58:46.560]   Or you can pull it from...
[00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:51.080]   That's right into the iMovie, just like iMovie on the desktop.
[00:58:51.080 --> 00:58:56.800]   I think it's just going to allow a lot more people to make their own little movies.
[00:58:56.800 --> 00:59:00.520]   I see it popping up a lot more on Facebook.
[00:59:00.520 --> 00:59:06.240]   Friends that aren't necessarily video people or photography people, just putting up little
[00:59:06.240 --> 00:59:09.320]   clips, actually creating little videos.
[00:59:09.320 --> 00:59:10.640]   Do you have a funny size?
[00:59:10.640 --> 00:59:13.680]   This is going to be weird though to be holding up this.
[00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:14.680]   All right.
[00:59:14.680 --> 00:59:19.960]   Let's shoot the video now.
[00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:21.200]   What are the dimensions?
[00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:22.200]   Is it a lot smaller?
[00:59:22.200 --> 00:59:24.800]   It's thinner, but the same size.
[00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:27.240]   One-third thinner, same size.
[00:59:27.240 --> 00:59:31.120]   Same memory capabilities.
[00:59:31.120 --> 00:59:32.120]   Just faster though.
[00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:36.560]   I think a lot of this comes from the faster processor, the better GPU, that kind of thing.
[00:59:36.560 --> 00:59:37.560]   How does that feel?
[00:59:37.560 --> 00:59:38.560]   It feels weird.
[00:59:38.560 --> 00:59:39.560]   Yeah.
[00:59:39.560 --> 00:59:47.520]   It feels a little weird.
[00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:52.960]   They are definitely pitching this as the big use case for the iPad 2, which is the camera,
[00:59:52.960 --> 00:59:57.800]   the ability to shoot video, the ability to share video, edit video, because they are
[00:59:57.800 --> 01:00:02.840]   spending quite a bit of time on iMovie to show you all of the ways that you can take
[01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:03.840]   best advantage of these cameras.
[01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:10.680]   I still think, and Chatham, if you've seen it, we haven't seen specs on the camera's
[01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:12.400]   resolution or capabilities.
[01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:15.840]   I went back through, kind of scrolled back through to see if they had implied it even
[01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:16.840]   anything.
[01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:17.840]   Yeah.
[01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:18.840]   I haven't.
[01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:19.840]   Four-three, by the way, right?
[01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:21.680]   They haven't changed the aspect ratio.
[01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:23.280]   No, that's a little weird as well.
[01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:24.760]   You'll be editing in four-three.
[01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:31.040]   Well, I mean, when you're doing that type of video editing, I mean, I guess it would
[01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:33.080]   be nice to have 60 min.
[01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:38.120]   Some of these pictures look like they might be 69, but they're showing in the iMovie demo.
[01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:41.760]   Voiceover recording system, so you could do your own audio tracks.
[01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:42.760]   That's kind of cool.
[01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:50.200]   Let's go back to the beginning here, and I'm going to bring out my project settings, and
[01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:53.040]   switch to one of my other new themes called Neon.
[01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:55.000]   It's a really bold theme.
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.280]   We've got this fade out to black as well.
[01:00:57.280 --> 01:01:02.200]   When I tap away, you can see the really nice bold opening title that we have.
[01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:07.840]   We also have a great theme transition, really nice lower thirds.
[01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:13.320]   The music automatically switched when I switched themes, which is the default, but I can mix
[01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:14.320]   and match.
[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:15.840]   So I can go back to my audio bin.
[01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:18.200]   I can choose a song for my iTunes library.
[01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:20.880]   This is somebody sitting exactly where I was sitting.
[01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:24.440]   This is someone who is experiencing their last invitation.
[01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:25.440]   Yeah.
[01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:29.480]   And you can hear his voice kind of talking to my background.
[01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:31.440]   Doesn't that look 69?
[01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:33.840]   It's hard to tell.
[01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:41.640]   I've used iMovie at all on the iPhone.
[01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:42.640]   I have.
[01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:43.640]   It's very tough to use.
[01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:46.680]   It's such a small interface that you just, it's really tough, but I haven't done anything
[01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:47.680]   major with it.
[01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:49.280]   Are there people making movies with it?
[01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:50.280]   I know.
[01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:51.280]   I know.
[01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:52.840]   I've seen like crops up on Vimeo.
[01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:59.100]   People are doing amazing things, like even processing their iPhone movies with like Red
[01:01:59.100 --> 01:02:01.120]   Bullet and other cool like effects.
[01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:02.120]   That's crazy.
[01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:04.320]   And it's crazy that this is possible.
[01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:10.720]   I mean, I take a lot of video just out and about, but I never actually do anything with
[01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:11.720]   it.
[01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:15.920]   And I think that if I did have it on the iPad, I might be more inclined to do so.
[01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:17.600]   I think it's very intriguing.
[01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:21.360]   You're going to allow you to share the share button, let you send to YouTube, Facebook,
[01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:23.120]   Vimeo, CNN and iTunes.
[01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:31.320]   So you can, you can publish right in and start selling your videos, your vacation videos.
[01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:36.960]   And that is the new version of me on the iPad 2.
[01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:40.200]   There we go.
[01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:41.200]   You fool.
[01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:47.200]   I don't know who that is, but I'm not going to, I'm not going to aid in a bet.
[01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:51.520]   His stream just died, by the way.
[01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:57.120]   Probably is the Apple people rushed over and grabbed it from him.
[01:02:57.120 --> 01:02:58.360]   He's just frozen right there.
[01:02:58.360 --> 01:02:59.360]   Steve's back on stage.
[01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:00.360]   That's not Steve.
[01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:04.960]   I don't know what it is either.
[01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:05.960]   I'm sure.
[01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:11.240]   But I feel for him because I know exactly what's going on right now.
[01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:13.400]   Let's refresh that Apple store, see if we can buy it yet.
[01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:17.000]   I imagine it'll, it'll, it'll come back up immediately.
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:20.880]   Are they going to withhold the white one for a little bit here?
[01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:22.560]   They say the same time.
[01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:25.320]   Both of them will, and he got a big laugh when Steve Jobs said that.
[01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:27.320]   He said both available at launch.
[01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:28.320]   Yeah, all right.
[01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:29.880]   I believe it when I see it.
[01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:31.480]   Would you buy a white one?
[01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:33.720]   I like black electronics.
[01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:34.720]   Me too.
[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:36.120]   I'm a bit of a, I'm a bit of a boy.
[01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:39.360]   I like, you know, I like steel and I like, you know.
[01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:40.360]   I'm with you.
[01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:42.560]   And I think it's white's just weird looking.
[01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:43.560]   Maybe it's for doctors.
[01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:45.760]   But the chick's dig it.
[01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:48.080]   Lisa, apparently not a chick.
[01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:49.080]   That's what she just said.
[01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:53.800]   I movie $5 available March 11th in the App Store for the unified app.
[01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:56.160]   And next up is GarageBand for iPhone.
[01:03:56.160 --> 01:04:01.880]   Oh, I think that's a real opportunity as well to do some really interesting stuff.
[01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:06.200]   Well, now this is interesting because if I can connect a decent mic, eight track recording
[01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:09.080]   and mixing, 250 plus loops.
[01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:12.440]   Of course you can record a, attach a good mic.
[01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:16.240]   We in fact were able to attach good mics using the USB adapter.
[01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:19.760]   Seemed like a loophole in Apple's adapter, but maybe it wasn't.
[01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:22.760]   Maybe that's just the beginning.
[01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:26.560]   And then you can do podcasting with your iPad out on the go.
[01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:33.800]   Compatible with the Mac version, you can email AACs right off the iPad.
[01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:37.960]   Let's get the Verizon version of this.
[01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:43.120]   I don't know what I'm saying.
[01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:44.680]   The Verizon version of the iPad.
[01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:46.480]   Eileen, just tie me to the mast.
[01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:50.360]   And no matter what I say, do not let me press buy.
[01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:51.360]   Okay?
[01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:53.800]   It's time to the mast.
[01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:55.440]   It's not a time.
[01:04:55.440 --> 01:05:00.520]   No matter how much you beg, no matter how much I beg, do not let me press the buy button.
[01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:05.040]   I can, I can build, I can spec, but do not let me press the buy button.
[01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:07.160]   Touch instruments, grand piano organ.
[01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:08.640]   Guitar drum bass.
[01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:11.360]   This actually sounds fantastic.
[01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:15.400]   Guitar amps and effects, eight track recording and mixing.
[01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:18.240]   Obviously that probably means overdubbing, right?
[01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:22.600]   I don't know how you do eight track recording into the, maybe you could 250 plus loops.
[01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:23.600]   Very.
[01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:27.800]   I hope they got some new loops because I'll be honest.
[01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:28.800]   Oh yeah.
[01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:29.800]   Well, they've been selling loops for a long time.
[01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:31.560]   You have to hear those everywhere.
[01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:32.560]   Yeah.
[01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:33.560]   I do.
[01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:34.560]   And you hear them everywhere.
[01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:35.560]   Yeah.
[01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:36.560]   In actual movies.
[01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:39.160]   And I'm like, guys, I know what you're doing.
[01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:42.160]   They really, they really should buy some buy some commercial loops.
[01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:43.800]   Don't use the free stuff.
[01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:46.560]   You can tap the keys just like a real piano.
[01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:48.440]   There's a button for a sustained pedal.
[01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:49.440]   Wow.
[01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:50.440]   That's cool.
[01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:51.440]   You play the piano.
[01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:52.440]   You play the guitar.
[01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:53.440]   I play the guitar.
[01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:54.440]   Yeah.
[01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:55.440]   You could strum your iPad.
[01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:56.440]   I, I've tried that with the iPhone.
[01:05:56.440 --> 01:05:57.440]   The whole.
[01:05:57.440 --> 01:05:58.440]   Yeah.
[01:05:58.440 --> 01:05:59.440]   It's, it's impossible.
[01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:01.320]   It's like, yeah, well you don't get the feedback you need, right?
[01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:02.320]   Yeah.
[01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:03.320]   It doesn't.
[01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:04.320]   Yeah.
[01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:10.760]   So, I don't know how that would be since it doesn't have pressure sensitivity.
[01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:12.240]   I guess you can sustain by holding.
[01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:14.920]   Well, you tap it softly for quiet notes harder for louder.
[01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:15.920]   So that would work pressure.
[01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:16.920]   Dynamic pressure.
[01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:18.520]   Oh, it's how fat the finger is.
[01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:19.520]   Yeah.
[01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:23.440]   That's actually, somebody did simulate pressure on the iPad by exactly that.
[01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:26.320]   They used the accelerometer to measure the force of the top.
[01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:27.320]   Oh, okay.
[01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:28.320]   So hit it hard.
[01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:29.320]   Yeah.
[01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:30.320]   Hahaha.
[01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:31.880]   Interesting.
[01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:33.680]   That's very, that's a very interesting approach.
[01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:34.680]   All right.
[01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:40.240]   Coming up in just a little bit, we will continue with our coverage, our live coverage of the
[01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:43.600]   iPad to announcement, Annie and Akka, who's inside.
[01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:44.920]   I believe we'll be coming out.
[01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:48.480]   Sarah Lane is waiting for him to tell us what he thinks and then going off to the demo
[01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:53.800]   room so we can, he can get some hands on with the new iPad too.
[01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:58.840]   But before we go there, I do want to mention our friends at audible.com.
[01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:07.000]   We love audible, audible is the place to go for 75,000 books and all kinds.
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:08.400]   Now I want you to get the subscription.
[01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:09.400]   You get the gold account.
[01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:11.160]   That's a book a month.
[01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:14.520]   Not nearly enough in the long run.
[01:07:14.520 --> 01:07:16.760]   But it will get you started.
[01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:19.360]   First book is free because you get your first month free.
[01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:20.400]   So this is for you Lisa.
[01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:25.080]   So you, if you want to, let's see, let's pick something that will help Lisa sleep.
[01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:26.080]   Yes.
[01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:28.560]   Something, something sleep-ifying.
[01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:31.440]   The problem is I really enjoy thrillers.
[01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:33.280]   Oh, you like this.
[01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:34.280]   Okay.
[01:07:34.280 --> 01:07:35.280]   Yeah.
[01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:36.280]   Tim Curry.
[01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:37.280]   You know who that is?
[01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:38.280]   Frank Frank infertor.
[01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:48.800]   You know, he's a guy who did, he was a, anyway, let me play you some, this is he recorded journey
[01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:51.840]   to the center of the earth, which is the classic Jules Verne sci-fi.
[01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:54.980]   Let me just play you a little bit of Tim Curry.
[01:07:54.980 --> 01:07:55.980]   This I think you know.
[01:07:55.980 --> 01:07:56.980]   You remember a visit.
[01:07:56.980 --> 01:07:57.980]   Oh, that woke me up.
[01:07:57.980 --> 01:08:02.320]   It celebrated chemist, paid me in 1825.
[01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:07.560]   Not the least since I only came into the world 19 years afterwards.
[01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:09.000]   Oh, I like that.
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:10.480]   He's not doing Frank infertor.
[01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:15.400]   He's not a sweet transvest.
[01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:16.400]   Let's see.
[01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:18.880]   Something to, something to put Lisa to sleep.
[01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:25.240]   If you go to Audible, see this is the hard part is you go to audible.com/macbreak and sign
[01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:26.240]   up for that account.
[01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:27.240]   Your first one is free.
[01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:29.140]   Here, this is good.
[01:08:29.140 --> 01:08:30.740]   This will put you asleep.
[01:08:30.740 --> 01:08:32.340]   I listen to this.
[01:08:32.340 --> 01:08:34.900]   It's the the dyline llama.
[01:08:34.900 --> 01:08:35.900]   How to be compassionate.
[01:08:35.900 --> 01:08:38.300]   Oh, okay.
[01:08:38.300 --> 01:08:39.300]   Compassion always puts you.
[01:08:39.300 --> 01:08:41.500]   Not the zombie thriller I was hoping for.
[01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:42.500]   They do have.
[01:08:42.500 --> 01:08:45.380]   And I was incorrect them for a better future.
[01:08:45.380 --> 01:08:48.660]   He begins by explaining how caring for others.
[01:08:48.660 --> 01:08:49.740]   Okay, that's not good.
[01:08:49.740 --> 01:08:50.740]   You want zombies?
[01:08:50.740 --> 01:08:52.100]   Yeah, I like zombies.
[01:08:52.100 --> 01:08:54.060]   You read Pride and Prejudice and zombies?
[01:08:54.060 --> 01:08:55.060]   No, I haven't.
[01:08:55.060 --> 01:08:56.060]   It's good.
[01:08:56.060 --> 01:08:58.860]   Yeah, because it's Jane Austen.
[01:08:58.860 --> 01:09:00.560]   So it's very sleepifying.
[01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:01.560]   Plus zombies.
[01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:03.560]   Anything that makes the zombies in there.
[01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:05.600]   I'm like, there's so many good zombie books on here.
[01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:08.440]   There's World War Z in oral history of the zombie war.
[01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:09.840]   You've read that, right?
[01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:12.280]   Here's Pride and Prejudice and zombies.
[01:09:12.280 --> 01:09:15.000]   Now with ultra violent zombie mayhem.
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.000]   Listen to this.
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.000]   You're going to let Catherine grail.
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.080]   I got, Kellgren reads this and she's so good.
[01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:20.080]   She's so British.
[01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:21.280]   Mr. Bingley.
[01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:23.680]   He had always intended to visit him.
[01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:27.580]   So to the last, always assuring his wife that he should not go.
[01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:28.580]   You're getting sleepy, aren't you?
[01:09:28.580 --> 01:09:32.500]   Until the evening after the visit was paid, she had no knowledge of it.
[01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:33.500]   It was then...
[01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:35.580]   Oh yeah, it is sleepy.
[01:09:35.580 --> 01:09:37.340]   It's like mom reading to you.
[01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:38.340]   Yeah.
[01:09:38.340 --> 01:09:39.340]   It's like mom reading to you.
[01:09:39.340 --> 01:09:40.340]   Yeah.
[01:09:40.340 --> 01:09:41.340]   You're not asleep.
[01:09:41.340 --> 01:09:42.340]   Yeah.
[01:09:42.340 --> 01:09:43.340]   He's suddenly addressed her weird.
[01:09:43.340 --> 01:09:44.340]   Yeah, feeling better already.
[01:09:44.340 --> 01:09:45.340]   I'm feeling good.
[01:09:45.340 --> 01:09:46.340]   I want you to check it out, audible.com.
[01:09:46.340 --> 01:09:47.860]   We're going to get least an account.
[01:09:47.860 --> 01:09:48.860]   You get your account.
[01:09:48.860 --> 01:09:50.460]   Your first one's free.
[01:09:50.460 --> 01:09:53.660]   I think Pride and Prejudice and zombies would be great if you haven't read that yet.
[01:09:53.660 --> 01:09:56.120]   Maybe exploring the center of the earth with Tim Curry.
[01:09:56.120 --> 01:09:58.560]   There's so many great choices.
[01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:01.560]   Audible.com/MacBreak.
[01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:06.560]   It plays on your new iPad, plays on your old iPad, your iPhone, your all the iPods, all
[01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:08.760]   the zooms even.
[01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:14.120]   Not, you know, it's not a bad thing to dedicate a device to your books.
[01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:16.720]   Like I have one iPod that's just got all my books on it.
[01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:18.080]   Then that's my book iPod.
[01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:20.480]   And I keep that in the car.
[01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:22.680]   Audible.com/MacBreak.
[01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:23.680]   We love them.
[01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:24.680]   We know you will too.
[01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:25.680]   Give them a try today.
[01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:28.300]   Apparently if you go to apple.com/ipad they've updated it for the new one.
[01:10:28.300 --> 01:10:29.300]   Ooh.
[01:10:29.300 --> 01:10:30.300]   Let me do that.
[01:10:30.300 --> 01:10:32.420]   I think it is.
[01:10:32.420 --> 01:10:35.260]   Now you got to tell me that stuff before you tell them in public.
[01:10:35.260 --> 01:10:36.260]   Yeah, I know.
[01:10:36.260 --> 01:10:37.260]   I'm sorry.
[01:10:37.260 --> 01:10:38.260]   No, they worked.
[01:10:38.260 --> 01:10:39.260]   It worked.
[01:10:39.260 --> 01:10:40.260]   Yeah, it came up for me too.
[01:10:40.260 --> 01:10:41.260]   Yeah.
[01:10:41.260 --> 01:10:42.260]   Yeah, that's good.
[01:10:42.260 --> 01:10:46.220]   And there's that how to buy button that you're not allowed to press.
[01:10:46.220 --> 01:10:47.220]   Lesson your hand more.
[01:10:47.220 --> 01:10:51.620]   Let's see if we get those specs for the camera here.
[01:10:51.620 --> 01:10:52.620]   Ten more about the cameras.
[01:10:52.620 --> 01:10:53.620]   Ten hour battery.
[01:10:53.620 --> 01:10:54.620]   Yep.
[01:10:54.620 --> 01:10:56.200]   Honestly, the battery is so amazing on the iPad.
[01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:59.360]   Yeah, they didn't improve the battery, but as long as they don't reduce it.
[01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:00.360]   That's not a big deal.
[01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:01.360]   Yeah.
[01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:03.000]   Still looking for specs.
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000]   This is just all the crap they're going to put on there.
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:06.000]   Oh, the white one looks so different.
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:07.320]   It's like a tech specs.
[01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:10.640]   7.31 inches, 9.5 front camera.
[01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:17.240]   Back camera is a little bit offset right under the on/off button.
[01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:21.160]   The front facing camera is right in the center as it should be.
[01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:22.160]   There's a little bit of a scoop.
[01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:27.620]   You can buy iPad 2 at your favorite Apple retail store starting at 5 p.m. on March 11.
[01:11:27.620 --> 01:11:28.620]   I guess we'll be there.
[01:11:28.620 --> 01:11:29.620]   March 11.
[01:11:29.620 --> 01:11:31.620]   So the evening launch instead of a morning launch.
[01:11:31.620 --> 01:11:34.620]   That's much nicer for us night owl people.
[01:11:34.620 --> 01:11:35.620]   Yeah, right.
[01:11:35.620 --> 01:11:39.060]   Because honestly, I have not made a launch in a very long time.
[01:11:39.060 --> 01:11:40.980]   We're trying to get a schedule for mostly photo.
[01:11:40.980 --> 01:11:45.060]   And Lisa won't do an 11 a.m. show because it's too early.
[01:11:45.060 --> 01:11:46.060]   Hi.
[01:11:46.060 --> 01:11:47.060]   When do you get up?
[01:11:47.060 --> 01:11:48.060]   I'm up all night.
[01:11:48.060 --> 01:11:49.060]   She's on the lion time.
[01:11:49.060 --> 01:11:51.660]   We had a conference call with her at three in the afternoon.
[01:11:51.660 --> 01:11:53.040]   The other day she was still in her jammies.
[01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:54.040]   I know.
[01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:55.040]   I'm sorry.
[01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:56.040]   I'm revealing your secrets.
[01:11:56.040 --> 01:11:58.120]   Yeah, I'm a night owl.
[01:11:58.120 --> 01:11:59.120]   That's OK.
[01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:02.080]   9.7 inch display still 1024 by 768.
[01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:04.040]   So still for three.
[01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:06.560]   One gigahertz dual core A5 custom chip.
[01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:07.560]   All right.
[01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:08.560]   Here we go.
[01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:11.960]   Yes, 720p HD recording 30 frames a second with audio.
[01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:12.960]   Not bad.
[01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:15.880]   Still camera has a 5x digital zoom front recording VGA.
[01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:17.720]   That's about what you'd expect.
[01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:20.140]   They don't say what the resolution of the back camera is.
[01:12:20.140 --> 01:12:22.660]   But if it can shoot 720p, that's good.
[01:12:22.660 --> 01:12:25.300]   And 30 frames per second is pretty decent.
[01:12:25.300 --> 01:12:27.220]   Interesting.
[01:12:27.220 --> 01:12:30.980]   3-axis gyro.
[01:12:30.980 --> 01:12:31.980]   That's new.
[01:12:31.980 --> 01:12:38.900]   Accelerometer ambient light sensor digital compass won't have GPS unless you buy the
[01:12:38.900 --> 01:12:41.020]   3G model.
[01:12:41.020 --> 01:12:42.980]   Here's a picture of the garage band.
[01:12:42.980 --> 01:12:44.540]   They're still talking about that.
[01:12:44.540 --> 01:12:45.540]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:12:45.540 --> 01:12:47.540]   Why do you say that?
[01:12:47.540 --> 01:12:52.200]   Not having-- because I mean, the whole thing with sharing pictures now is that you have
[01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:56.320]   the GPS and you're sharing your location and you're checking in.
[01:12:56.320 --> 01:12:57.320]   Well, that's the way-- yeah.
[01:12:57.320 --> 01:12:58.320]   But that's the way the old one was too.
[01:12:58.320 --> 01:12:59.320]   Yeah.
[01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:01.520]   Virtual drum kits too.
[01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:04.200]   So now you finally, you can play like Keith Moon.
[01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:06.360]   Well, except for being dead.
[01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:09.120]   I know about this white one.
[01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:10.120]   It looks--
[01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:11.120]   John Bonham.
[01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:16.200]   I don't know who you would like to play like.
[01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:23.660]   I'm thinking nothing yet on this website about whether you can reserve video mirroring
[01:13:23.660 --> 01:13:25.120]   and video out support.
[01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:28.640]   I think this is one of the most interesting parts of the story is that you can finally
[01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:35.220]   mirror the display at 1080p if you're playing back high def videos.
[01:13:35.220 --> 01:13:37.280]   You do have to spy a special cable.
[01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:44.160]   Video out supports 576p and 480p with the Apple component cable, 576 and 480i with the
[01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:45.360]   Apple composite cable.
[01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:46.360]   That's what you'd expect.
[01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:51.840]   H.264 video 720p 30 frames a second playback.
[01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:53.640]   Now, I don't know what it records in.
[01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:56.080]   I would guess-- I don't know.
[01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:58.640]   It doesn't say what it records in.
[01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:01.520]   Well, the camera's capable of 720p.
[01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:02.520]   30 frames.
[01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:05.360]   Could be H. could be-- well, they could be MJ pig.
[01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:08.120]   They sometimes they use that too.
[01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:09.120]   Yeah.
[01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:14.000]   I wonder if there will be one more thing.
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:17.880]   Smart instruments allow you to be musical even if you've never played an instrument.
[01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:18.880]   Thank God.
[01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:20.920]   Because I need a smart instrument.
[01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:21.920]   Smart guitar pre-picks that.
[01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:23.160]   Look at the Tarte words.
[01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:28.560]   That would be fun to tap your iPad.
[01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:30.560]   That would be fun.
[01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:31.560]   Yeah.
[01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:33.000]   Oh my gosh.
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.160]   He just said campfires will never be the same.
[01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:36.160]   Oh dear.
[01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:37.160]   Please.
[01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:38.160]   Please.
[01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:41.000]   Do not bring your iPad to campouts.
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:42.000]   Please.
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:43.000]   I beg of you.
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:44.000]   Yeah.
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:45.000]   Please.
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:53.160]   Well, we are getting a perfectly normal Apple announcement.
[01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:54.480]   It's precisely what we expected.
[01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:58.520]   The thing that's interesting and that was unexpected is that it's Steve Jobs doing it.
[01:14:58.520 --> 01:15:01.080]   And Lisa, you brought up the pertinent question at this point.
[01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:02.080]   Will there be one more thing?
[01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:03.240]   Will there be one more thing?
[01:15:03.240 --> 01:15:05.400]   Steve likes the one more thing.
[01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:07.680]   Any guesses?
[01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:08.680]   My guess is there will not.
[01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:10.800]   Yeah, I'm guessing not.
[01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:11.800]   But we'll see.
[01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:15.440]   I don't think of anything that would make sense for them to come out.
[01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:17.760]   He could mention the iPhone 5, I suppose.
[01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:18.960]   I don't see any reason to do that now.
[01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:19.960]   Yeah.
[01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:20.960]   I'll be out for a few months.
[01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:22.920]   He could say iPad 3 this fall.
[01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:25.360]   That would be bad because it would be animalized sales.
[01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:27.960]   That's kind of a style.
[01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:28.960]   The ice cream.
[01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:29.960]   Ah, I got one for you.
[01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:31.960]   Oh yeah.
[01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:33.360]   T-Mobile and Sprint iPhone.
[01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:34.360]   Ah, there you go.
[01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:35.360]   What do you think?
[01:15:35.360 --> 01:15:36.360]   Well, no.
[01:15:36.360 --> 01:15:37.360]   Or T-Mobile and Sprint.
[01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:38.840]   If he were going to do that, he would have announced the iPad.
[01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:39.840]   T-Mobile and Sprint iPads.
[01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:44.560]   Well, no, he is not going to do that after the fact.
[01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:47.440]   So Lisa, do you think he could play that?
[01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:48.920]   Strum that?
[01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:51.080]   I can maybe strum that.
[01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:53.080]   Strum or not?
[01:15:53.080 --> 01:15:57.120]   It's probably a disadvantage if you know how to play an instrument, to be honest.
[01:15:57.120 --> 01:15:59.160]   Because it's just going to confuse the hell out of you.
[01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:01.520]   Yeah, it's like when you try to play rock band.
[01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:03.000]   If you actually know what you're doing.
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:04.000]   I know it's so fascinating.
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:05.000]   You're like, oh, I can't.
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:10.680]   Where's the high?
[01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:13.680]   It's a little bit like that with connect and dancing too.
[01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:15.400]   I wouldn't know that.
[01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:21.440]   The dancing and connect is so like, according to connect, I'm an amazing dancer.
[01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:22.440]   Yeah, me too.
[01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:27.480]   Because I can do, you know, I mean, it's just, you're right.
[01:16:27.480 --> 01:16:28.480]   It's not dancing.
[01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:30.840]   I don't know what it is exactly, but it's not dancing.
[01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:31.840]   It's jazz-icized.
[01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:32.840]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:33.840]   I mean, that's what it is.
[01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:34.840]   I mean, that's what it is.
[01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:37.560]   Jackie Sorenson's aerobic dancing.
[01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:40.640]   You're watching live coverage of Apple's iPad 2 announcement from Slingbox.
[01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:42.680]   We're going to start Mac Break Weekly in just a little bit.
[01:16:42.680 --> 01:16:44.880]   I have a feeling they're about to wrap up.
[01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:47.440]   Andy Inaco will go to the demo room immediately.
[01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:52.440]   We'll try to get live video from the demo room so that we can see this in action for
[01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:53.440]   the first time.
[01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:55.760]   I want to touch it.
[01:16:55.760 --> 01:17:00.480]   Given that it's coming out in just nine days, March 11th availability, once again.
[01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:01.480]   It's up to eight tracks.
[01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:09.600]   I'd be shocked if they didn't have it in a demo room for everybody to play with.
[01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:13.040]   Trim and drag the region to layer the song, sports update track, still talking about GarageBand.
[01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:14.600]   They said they're going to talk about two more apps.
[01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:15.600]   They talked about iMovie.
[01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:16.600]   They're talking about GarageBand.
[01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:22.760]   So we expect after this they'll probably wrap it up.
[01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:25.560]   They're talking about GarageBand for quite a while.
[01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:26.560]   Hmm.
[01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:28.200]   I have to say.
[01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:29.800]   Do you use GarageBand?
[01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:30.800]   Never.
[01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:39.800]   My son, who really is into making this kind of music, did, but found it frustrating after
[01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:40.800]   a while.
[01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:45.600]   I gave him a copy of LogicExpress and it uses that.
[01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:46.600]   And reason.
[01:17:46.600 --> 01:17:51.840]   I think that it's a great starting point, but he quickly became frustrated with the limitations
[01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:52.840]   of GarageBand.
[01:17:52.840 --> 01:17:54.640]   He's much happier with LogicExpress.
[01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:57.880]   I actually use GarageBand all the time to do voiceovers.
[01:17:57.880 --> 01:17:58.880]   Really?
[01:17:58.880 --> 01:17:59.880]   I do voiceovers in all my videos.
[01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:00.880]   Recordings that way.
[01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:04.320]   Yeah, I just plug in a USB mic and then just record it.
[01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:05.320]   It's fine for that.
[01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:08.840]   Yeah, and I don't need anything fancy.
[01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:10.120]   There are plenty of other choices, though.
[01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:15.480]   There's Feltip Sound Studio, there's Amadeus Pro, there's of course Audacity.
[01:18:15.480 --> 01:18:19.400]   So there are lots of choices for something like that.
[01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:20.800]   There's a built-in mixing board.
[01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:22.280]   They're still talking about GarageBand.
[01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:23.280]   They love it.
[01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:24.600]   Swipe over track icons to get your mix.
[01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:31.120]   See, Henry using this for ad hoc dubstep mixtounds.
[01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:37.640]   I think it's the younger generation that's just using these tools to make their YouTube
[01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:41.280]   videos and do that kind of thing.
[01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:42.280]   It's a good start.
[01:18:42.280 --> 01:18:45.280]   Like all the iLife software, that's what it's good for.
[01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:46.600]   It's a starting point.
[01:18:46.600 --> 01:18:51.200]   One thing that's very gratifying to me is that it is more and more.
[01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:56.640]   When the iPad came out, I was really of the opinions and I never really changed it.
[01:18:56.640 --> 01:19:00.120]   It was a consumption device, more than a creation device.
[01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:01.800]   Yeah, you could create, but it was hard work.
[01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:08.440]   You had to really kind of mess with it to use pages or keynote or numbers.
[01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:13.480]   But now I think with the camera, with these programs, it is much more of a content creation
[01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:14.480]   device.
[01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:19.000]   Apple's moving it more into that computer space and less into that read-only space.
[01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.600]   They say you'll be able to plug in your guitar to the iPad.
[01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:22.600]   Wow.
[01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:23.600]   Oh, that's going to cool.
[01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:24.600]   Yeah, see that you use that.
[01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:25.600]   No, no ideas.
[01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:28.320]   You can record your voice and your guitar.
[01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:33.520]   You can email songs or send it to your iTunes library and then it'll sync into iTunes.
[01:19:33.520 --> 01:19:34.520]   Wow.
[01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:35.520]   I guess.
[01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:41.960]   I really can't believe how long they're talking about garage.
[01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:42.960]   Wow.
[01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:43.960]   I guess.
[01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:45.960]   Steve's back on stage.
[01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:46.960]   Hey, Steve.
[01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:47.960]   You know what?
[01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:48.960]   I'm not going to buy this stuff.
[01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:49.960]   No.
[01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:50.960]   Yeah.
[01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:51.960]   Really?
[01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:52.960]   Yeah.
[01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:54.960]   Well, it's about time because if he weren't, I think it'd just be sad.
[01:19:54.960 --> 01:19:58.080]   It was really sad if he came up and goes, you know, that one wasn't so good.
[01:19:58.080 --> 01:19:59.520]   I'm less than impressed.
[01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:00.520]   Go back and try it again.
[01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:01.520]   Yeah, you're fired.
[01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:02.520]   You're all fired.
[01:20:02.520 --> 01:20:04.440]   Oh, they're long.
[01:20:04.440 --> 01:20:06.160]   That's during South by Southwest.
[01:20:06.160 --> 01:20:07.160]   What?
[01:20:07.160 --> 01:20:08.160]   Yeah, March 11th.
[01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:09.920]   Well, we'll get it because that's the Friday.
[01:20:09.920 --> 01:20:10.920]   Oh, you're right.
[01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:11.920]   I'm on a plane.
[01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:12.920]   I know.
[01:20:12.920 --> 01:20:13.920]   I'm on a plane.
[01:20:13.920 --> 01:20:14.920]   Son of a bee.
[01:20:14.920 --> 01:20:15.920]   What is wrong with you, Apple?
[01:20:15.920 --> 01:20:16.920]   Don't you know?
[01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:17.920]   I'm on a plane.
[01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:20.800]   I'll overpay for cases, cables, and products.
[01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:24.400]   Why do you make me overpay on a day when I'm flying?
[01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:25.400]   We leave that evening.
[01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:26.960]   Well, that's when it goes on sale.
[01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:27.960]   5 p.m.
[01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:28.960]   Oh, no, you'll be.
[01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:30.360]   I'm on a plane exactly then.
[01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:31.960]   Oh, we can stop on the way.
[01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:33.480]   I think your flights at the worst.
[01:20:33.480 --> 01:20:34.840]   Is there an Apple store in Austin?
[01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:35.840]   Yes.
[01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:36.840]   It's going to be busy.
[01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:37.840]   Yes, it is.
[01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:38.840]   That's all I could say.
[01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:40.800]   Actually, there's a let's go to the Apple store in Austin.
[01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:41.960]   Yeah, let's do it.
[01:20:41.960 --> 01:20:42.960]   Field trip.
[01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:43.960]   We've got the live view.
[01:20:43.960 --> 01:20:44.960]   Yeah.
[01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:45.960]   Are we doing anything Friday?
[01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:51.280]   We're going to give you live coverage from Austin, Texas, of the iPad 2 launch.
[01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:54.280]   Lisa Bettany, Tom Merritt, and I will be there.
[01:20:54.280 --> 01:20:55.280]   Absolutely.
[01:20:55.280 --> 01:20:56.680]   Well, you get it like nine.
[01:20:56.680 --> 01:20:57.680]   Oh, crap.
[01:20:57.680 --> 01:20:59.440]   Well, they haven't said that yet.
[01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:01.520]   We just found the 5 p.m. thing on the website.
[01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:03.720]   I'll be there.
[01:21:03.720 --> 01:21:05.400]   Somebody in the chat room is saying, "This is boring.
[01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:08.360]   Can you put security now on?"
[01:21:08.360 --> 01:21:10.160]   Wow.
[01:21:10.160 --> 01:21:11.160]   That's hardcore.
[01:21:11.160 --> 01:21:12.160]   We're bantering.
[01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:14.160]   We've been talking about the harassment.
[01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:18.960]   There's 40,000 people watching this?
[01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:23.800]   Well, I think it is kind of boring right now because that's all they were talking about.
[01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:25.200]   Okay, now they're doing the recap.
[01:21:25.200 --> 01:21:30.240]   iPad 2 recap, FasterLider, thinner cameras, gyro, iOS 4.3 with FaceTime and photo booth.
[01:21:30.240 --> 01:21:35.560]   I movie and garage band available for $5 each over $65,000 apps, 3G on AT&T and Verizon.
[01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:36.560]   You're so good.
[01:21:36.560 --> 01:21:37.560]   You're so good.
[01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:41.440]   Same 10-hour battery life, same prices starting at $4.99.
[01:21:41.440 --> 01:21:42.960]   Black and white smart covers.
[01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:45.560]   We think 2011 is going to be the year of iPad 2.
[01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:50.520]   I'm going to go to the live view camera in just a moment as soon as they decide to put
[01:21:50.520 --> 01:21:51.520]   it down.
[01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:53.120]   Right now it's kind of...
[01:21:53.120 --> 01:21:55.120]   We're at Urban Boy...
[01:21:55.120 --> 01:21:56.120]   Whoa!
[01:21:56.120 --> 01:21:57.120]   Hey!
[01:21:57.120 --> 01:21:58.120]   We're at Urban Boy.
[01:21:58.120 --> 01:22:01.320]   Now, have some excitement for play.
[01:22:01.320 --> 01:22:02.320]   I like this.
[01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:03.320]   A lot of vans out there.
[01:22:03.320 --> 01:22:05.920]   They're playing a video on stage of the iPad.
[01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:06.920]   Hipster feet.
[01:22:06.920 --> 01:22:09.760]   We're giving the Hipster feet view in San Francisco.
[01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:11.200]   We're right out front of the Urban Boy.
[01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:13.200]   I saw some checks, set up for the Vans.
[01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:14.200]   Wait, one more thing?
[01:22:14.200 --> 01:22:15.200]   Is that one more thing?
[01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:18.400]   They're playing a video, so they'll play the video and they'll come back and they'll
[01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:19.960]   either say goodbye or do one more thing.
[01:22:19.960 --> 01:22:21.120]   I think that's all we've got left.
[01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:22.520]   Or John Mayer will appear.
[01:22:22.520 --> 01:22:23.520]   Oh God.
[01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:24.520]   Jack Johnson.
[01:22:24.520 --> 01:22:25.520]   Hello.
[01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:26.520]   Who knows?
[01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:28.320]   They did talk a lot about garage band, so we might get a musician.
[01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:32.800]   Jonathan Ive in the video, how amazingly mind-blowing the new design is.
[01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:35.360]   I did it, and it's blowing my mind.
[01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:37.960]   Imagine how you'll feel.
[01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:38.960]   I'm Jonathan Ives.
[01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:41.320]   I'm not even allowed in England in it, it's blowing my mind.
[01:22:41.320 --> 01:22:43.560]   It's just blowing my mind.
[01:22:43.560 --> 01:22:47.000]   When I woke up and I designed it, I was blown.
[01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:52.720]   Meanwhile, back to the center for the arts.
[01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:56.360]   It's this door that people will come out of when this is over.
[01:22:56.360 --> 01:22:58.440]   Yes, we have it.
[01:22:58.440 --> 01:23:00.840]   We have it first.
[01:23:00.840 --> 01:23:04.720]   This door, people will come out of this door in moments.
[01:23:04.720 --> 01:23:05.880]   Let's expand the focus.
[01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:11.200]   This very door, the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts door.
[01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:14.880]   I'm standing in front of the door at the Erba Buena Center for the Arts, where Johnny
[01:23:14.880 --> 01:23:18.000]   Ives is about to be blown away.
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:19.000]   Out the door.
[01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:23.000]   Out the door.
[01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:24.000]   That's the demo room.
[01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:25.000]   Oh, sorry.
[01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:26.000]   There it is.
[01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.320]   There's the camera you've all been waiting for.
[01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:33.400]   Actually, it's just a big hole in the back.
[01:23:33.400 --> 01:23:37.000]   Rigid, sturdy, even more precise.
[01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.120]   God it's hard not to make a dirty joke there.
[01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:40.880]   Sorry, Lisa.
[01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:44.080]   Let's go back to that revolutionary magical door.
[01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:49.040]   Here's the door, out of which the iPad 2 will emerge.
[01:23:49.040 --> 01:23:50.040]   There's Sarah Lane.
[01:23:50.040 --> 01:23:51.320]   Look, you see her dodo case?
[01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:52.320]   You can't miss it, can you?
[01:23:52.320 --> 01:23:53.320]   Yeah, I know.
[01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:54.320]   It's like a beacon.
[01:23:54.320 --> 01:23:56.160]   She's watching us in about 10 minutes.
[01:23:56.160 --> 01:23:57.760]   She's going to jump up and down, saying, I'm on camera.
[01:23:57.760 --> 01:23:59.440]   I'm on camera.
[01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:00.920]   There is a bit of a wave.
[01:24:00.920 --> 01:24:03.800]   Oh, people emerging.
[01:24:03.800 --> 01:24:04.800]   People emerging.
[01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:06.640]   Does he have an iPad 2?
[01:24:06.640 --> 01:24:07.640]   No.
[01:24:07.640 --> 01:24:09.400]   Strangely dressed hipsters emerging from door at the Buena
[01:24:09.400 --> 01:24:10.480]   Center.
[01:24:10.480 --> 01:24:11.480]   This just in.
[01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:13.680]   Man in a suit wears tennis shoes.
[01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:14.680]   Flash.
[01:24:14.680 --> 01:24:17.600]   I bet he's off to Samba Bartirum.
[01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:18.600]   Just a guess.
[01:24:18.600 --> 01:24:20.800]   Probably a B bar.
[01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:26.440]   And then Sarah will just hit the shoe.
[01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:27.440]   Yep.
[01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:28.440]   That's a size of it.
[01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:29.920]   Well, they're playing the video on stage right now, so there's
[01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:31.920]   nothing to talk about.
[01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:32.920]   Yep, apple.com.
[01:24:32.920 --> 01:24:39.280]   We do have those tech specs for the new iPad, just to recap.
[01:24:39.280 --> 01:24:43.640]   Same size, same screen resolution, same memory.
[01:24:43.640 --> 01:24:47.160]   Faster processor, dual core A5.
[01:24:47.160 --> 01:24:48.840]   Front and back facing cameras.
[01:24:48.840 --> 01:24:51.280]   We don't yet know the resolution of the back camera.
[01:24:51.280 --> 01:24:53.280]   Front cameras, VGA resolution.
[01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:56.960]   Back camera can shoot 720p video at 30 frames per second,
[01:24:56.960 --> 01:24:57.480]   plus audio.
[01:24:57.480 --> 01:24:58.760]   That's good.
[01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:01.760]   One third thinner, 0.34 inches, a little bit lighter.
[01:25:01.760 --> 01:25:04.640]   We point through those camera.
[01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:06.280]   New iOS to come out with it.
[01:25:06.280 --> 01:25:10.240]   iOS 4.3-- or is it 4.4?
[01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:11.240]   4.3.
[01:25:11.240 --> 01:25:12.240]   4.3.
[01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:13.240]   Yep.
[01:25:13.240 --> 01:25:14.240]   Which you'll have some--
[01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:15.240]   Is the RAM more?
[01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:16.240]   Same RAM.
[01:25:16.240 --> 01:25:17.240]   Well, we don't know.
[01:25:17.240 --> 01:25:18.240]   They never talk about RAM.
[01:25:18.240 --> 01:25:19.240]   Never mention that.
[01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:20.240]   Same storage, but not.
[01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:21.240]   Same storage.
[01:25:21.240 --> 01:25:22.320]   We don't know if the RAM is more-- you know, more RAM would
[01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:23.320]   help, but it has only 256.
[01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:25.680]   They did just said the graphics processor was nine times
[01:25:25.680 --> 01:25:26.680]   faster, too.
[01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:28.080]   They didn't give us any details.
[01:25:28.080 --> 01:25:29.080]   They never have.
[01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:30.280]   And they didn't mention the word ARM, even though we're
[01:25:30.280 --> 01:25:33.280]   pretty sure this is a Cortex-A8.
[01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:35.640]   We have 10-hour battery life.
[01:25:35.640 --> 01:25:38.440]   Two Apple stores in Austin, by the way, to choose from.
[01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:39.440]   Right.
[01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:40.600]   So we will be-- Lisa, you and I.
[01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:43.320]   What we'll do is-- now, when are you flying in?
[01:25:43.320 --> 01:25:46.080]   I'm flying in Thursday night, so I'll see you be there.
[01:25:46.080 --> 01:25:47.080]   So I'll see you be there.
[01:25:47.080 --> 01:25:48.080]   So I can--
[01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:49.080]   Why don't you go to the Apple store, be there, and I'll meet
[01:25:49.080 --> 01:25:50.080]   you there.
[01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:51.560]   And we'll all buy iPads.
[01:25:51.560 --> 01:25:52.560]   Mm.
[01:25:52.560 --> 01:25:53.560]   It'd be exciting.
[01:25:53.560 --> 01:25:56.960]   It'd be a moment in television history.
[01:25:56.960 --> 01:26:00.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:01.840]   I'll catch up as soon as I get there.
[01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:04.640]   Garageband, I believe--
[01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:07.560]   well, we know iMovie will be on all iOS 4.3 devices,
[01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:08.680]   including the iPhone.
[01:26:08.680 --> 01:26:10.760]   Because of the Retina display, which is very close in
[01:26:10.760 --> 01:26:13.040]   resolution to the iPad, I would expect that they will also
[01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:13.880]   do Garageband.
[01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:14.720]   Why wouldn't they, yeah?
[01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:15.280]   Yeah.
[01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:16.520]   But we don't know.
[01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:18.600]   You know what didn't come with the camera?
[01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:19.280]   What didn't come?
[01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:20.960]   A flash.
[01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:21.460]   Mm.
[01:26:21.460 --> 01:26:21.960]   Interesting.
[01:26:21.960 --> 01:26:22.360]   Do flash.
[01:26:22.360 --> 01:26:23.160]   Don't mind that.
[01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:23.760]   Yeah, I don't.
[01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:24.720]   I would do that.
[01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:25.280]   Bad joke.
[01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:27.320]   To be honest, it's not--
[01:26:27.320 --> 01:26:28.600]   We don't like flashes.
[01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:30.840]   No, the flash on the phone actually kind of annoys me,
[01:26:30.840 --> 01:26:33.040]   because I forget that it's all on or something.
[01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:34.080]   And I just turned it off.
[01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:35.440]   And then you have that delay?
[01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:35.960]   Yeah.
[01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:36.880]   The delay bugs me.
[01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:38.080]   Yeah, yeah, me too.
[01:26:38.080 --> 01:26:39.880]   I mean, I do use it, but--
[01:26:39.880 --> 01:26:43.200]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:26:43.200 --> 01:26:45.440]   We're hearing.
[01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:46.520]   Oh, this is the video.
[01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:47.240]   It's a blue cup.
[01:26:47.240 --> 01:26:50.360]   We've made advances in both form and function.
[01:26:50.360 --> 01:26:51.120]   How much is that?
[01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:51.640]   40 bucks?
[01:26:51.640 --> 01:26:52.280]   It's so sick.
[01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:52.640]   39.
[01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:54.120]   It's so beachy.
[01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:54.620]   Woo!
[01:26:54.620 --> 01:26:55.820]   I'm at leather now for 70.
[01:26:55.820 --> 01:26:56.560]   I can't think of that.
[01:26:56.560 --> 01:26:57.780]   It's a great product.
[01:26:57.780 --> 01:27:00.720]   That has defined an entire category,
[01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:02.540]   and has then been completely redesigned
[01:27:02.540 --> 01:27:04.120]   in such a short period of time.
[01:27:04.120 --> 01:27:05.640]   I'm just blown away by what I've done.
[01:27:05.640 --> 01:27:06.640]   It's just with the iPhone.
[01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:08.740]   In just a year ago, very few people
[01:27:08.740 --> 01:27:11.460]   had actually held an iPad in their hands.
[01:27:11.460 --> 01:27:14.520]   And now, with iPad in the hands of millions of consumers,
[01:27:14.520 --> 01:27:18.260]   it truly has become a blockbuster post-PC device.
[01:27:18.260 --> 01:27:20.060]   Apple's really rolled out the promotional engine on this.
[01:27:20.060 --> 01:27:21.560]   I've had two really build-ons.
[01:27:21.560 --> 01:27:24.420]   I mean, they always do this, but two self-congregations
[01:27:24.420 --> 01:27:26.960]   and graduate-story videos in one event.
[01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:29.320]   It has an all-new dual-core A5.
[01:27:29.320 --> 01:27:30.820]   I don't know of any other company
[01:27:30.820 --> 01:27:33.700]   that's been able to pull off two self-congratulatory videos
[01:27:33.700 --> 01:27:34.820]   in a single event.
[01:27:34.820 --> 01:27:37.140]   We built an front-facing camera, a facetime
[01:27:37.140 --> 01:27:40.300]   and photo booth, and a rear-facing camera that shoots HD video.
[01:27:40.300 --> 01:27:41.380]   These videos are so well-known.
[01:27:41.380 --> 01:27:44.220]   And we've been able to do all of this, but still maintain it.
[01:27:44.220 --> 01:27:46.500]   Trying to make my own videos with the five-offs.
[01:27:46.500 --> 01:27:47.620]   It's hard to do.
[01:27:47.620 --> 01:27:48.120]   Really?
[01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:49.120]   So hard.
[01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:51.220]   You need a soft box to do it.
[01:27:51.220 --> 01:27:52.220]   Just crash it.
[01:27:52.220 --> 01:27:52.720]   Yeah.
[01:27:52.720 --> 01:27:53.820]   We can do it on your studio.
[01:27:53.820 --> 01:27:54.820]   We can do it on your studio.
[01:27:54.820 --> 01:27:56.820]   We can do exactly this in the studio.
[01:27:56.820 --> 01:27:57.820]   We can do it on the studio.
[01:27:57.820 --> 01:27:58.820]   We can do it on the studio.
[01:27:58.820 --> 01:27:59.820]   Steve is back on stage now.
[01:27:59.820 --> 01:28:00.820]   And eliminated the edge.
[01:28:00.820 --> 01:28:02.820]   But I'm not done with Johnny Ives.
[01:28:02.820 --> 01:28:06.820]   But with the breakthroughs we've made with Unibody Engineering,
[01:28:06.820 --> 01:28:09.820]   it's rigid, sturdy, and even more precise.
[01:28:09.820 --> 01:28:11.820]   While the back of the product is made of--
[01:28:11.820 --> 01:28:14.820]   All Steve's saying is that this is a giantly forward
[01:28:14.820 --> 01:28:16.820]   and it will define the category for years to go.
[01:28:16.820 --> 01:28:17.820]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:28:17.820 --> 01:28:19.820]   Without compromising the iPad size and weight.
[01:28:19.820 --> 01:28:21.820]   And we'll set you a cheap rubber cover
[01:28:21.820 --> 01:28:23.820]   for five times what it cost us to make.
[01:28:23.820 --> 01:28:25.820]   It's like a cover at the same time.
[01:28:25.820 --> 01:28:26.820]   Imagine the profit.
[01:28:26.820 --> 01:28:27.820]   We've built in magnets.
[01:28:27.820 --> 01:28:28.820]   We've built in magnets.
[01:28:28.820 --> 01:28:29.820]   Together.
[01:28:29.820 --> 01:28:30.820]   It attaches my--
[01:28:30.820 --> 01:28:31.820]   My bad, my bad.
[01:28:31.820 --> 01:28:32.820]   That's $3.
[01:28:32.820 --> 01:28:33.820]   That's pretty cool.
[01:28:33.820 --> 01:28:34.820]   Wait a minute.
[01:28:34.820 --> 01:28:35.820]   It just snaps right on with the magnet.
[01:28:35.820 --> 01:28:36.820]   Oh, I didn't really know.
[01:28:36.820 --> 01:28:37.820]   You've opened the cover.
[01:28:37.820 --> 01:28:38.820]   It immediately wakes up.
[01:28:38.820 --> 01:28:39.820]   I don't like it.
[01:28:39.820 --> 01:28:40.820]   I mean, it doesn't look like--
[01:28:40.820 --> 01:28:42.820]   I wanted to wrap around, not just be in a full round cover.
[01:28:42.820 --> 01:28:43.820]   Oh, look at that.
[01:28:43.820 --> 01:28:44.820]   Oh, come on.
[01:28:44.820 --> 01:28:45.820]   This is what you do videos.
[01:28:45.820 --> 01:28:47.820]   That's magical and revolutionary.
[01:28:47.820 --> 01:28:48.820]   It's magnetic.
[01:28:48.820 --> 01:28:49.820]   It's magnetic.
[01:28:49.820 --> 01:28:50.820]   It's magical.
[01:28:50.820 --> 01:28:51.820]   There are ten colors.
[01:28:51.820 --> 01:28:53.820]   Five and polyurethane.
[01:28:53.820 --> 01:28:54.820]   And five and--
[01:28:54.820 --> 01:28:55.820]   It's a magic knit.
[01:28:55.820 --> 01:28:56.820]   And a line die.
[01:28:56.820 --> 01:28:59.820]   I might get a red and lime die leather cover for $70.
[01:28:59.820 --> 01:29:01.820]   I'm not buying that for a good time.
[01:29:01.820 --> 01:29:02.820]   I'm Johnny, I think I've ever seen it.
[01:29:02.820 --> 01:29:03.820]   It's all made of money now.
[01:29:03.820 --> 01:29:05.820]   It's at the same time, increasing its functionality.
[01:29:05.820 --> 01:29:08.820]   Ace Detective Apple Store is up now.
[01:29:08.820 --> 01:29:09.820]   Your Apple Store is up now.
[01:29:09.820 --> 01:29:11.820]   You brought FaceTime to the ice.
[01:29:11.820 --> 01:29:12.820]   It's not up for me.
[01:29:12.820 --> 01:29:13.820]   I kept trying to reload.
[01:29:13.820 --> 01:29:15.820]   Video calling on the iPhone 4.
[01:29:15.820 --> 01:29:16.820]   Maybe a certain service.
[01:29:16.820 --> 01:29:18.820]   Big iPad display.
[01:29:18.820 --> 01:29:19.820]   Really changed it.
[01:29:19.820 --> 01:29:20.820]   It's interesting.
[01:29:20.820 --> 01:29:24.820]   Maybe a little more compelling to have a big screen like that for FaceTime.
[01:29:24.820 --> 01:29:25.820]   And more expressive.
[01:29:25.820 --> 01:29:28.820]   There's a rear-facing HD video camera.
[01:29:28.820 --> 01:29:29.820]   So you can share the features.
[01:29:29.820 --> 01:29:31.820]   FaceTime uses the rear camera as well.
[01:29:31.820 --> 01:29:32.820]   That's good.
[01:29:32.820 --> 01:29:33.820]   As it does on the iPhone, of course.
[01:29:33.820 --> 01:29:35.820]   But FaceTime is just the beginning.
[01:29:35.820 --> 01:29:38.820]   You optimize the iOS to take advantage of the A5.
[01:29:38.820 --> 01:29:41.820]   I think we stand up pretty good chance being edited in this market.
[01:29:41.820 --> 01:29:45.820]   You ask that really leverage the whole process of the statement.
[01:29:45.820 --> 01:29:48.820]   He's talking about how the competitors are all focusing on speed.
[01:29:48.820 --> 01:29:50.820]   He says that's not right.
[01:29:50.820 --> 01:29:53.820]   You have to go after the intuitive way you use it.
[01:29:53.820 --> 01:29:55.820]   He's exactly right on that.
[01:29:55.820 --> 01:29:56.820]   That's just what Apple's been doing.
[01:29:56.820 --> 01:29:57.820]   He's exactly right on that.
[01:29:57.820 --> 01:30:02.820]   In fact, it's almost surprising that they mention the speed of the A5.
[01:30:02.820 --> 01:30:04.820]   This looks pretty good.
[01:30:04.820 --> 01:30:06.820]   This is the iMovie interface.
[01:30:06.820 --> 01:30:09.820]   GarageBand is an absolute blast.
[01:30:09.820 --> 01:30:14.820]   That's Lisa right there playing her guitar right into her amp.
[01:30:14.820 --> 01:30:16.820]   I wish I had more time.
[01:30:16.820 --> 01:30:18.820]   There's the white one.
[01:30:18.820 --> 01:30:19.820]   Yeah, I know.
[01:30:19.820 --> 01:30:21.820]   All these people seem so relaxed.
[01:30:21.820 --> 01:30:22.820]   Their lives are just...
[01:30:22.820 --> 01:30:23.820]   Yeah.
[01:30:23.820 --> 01:30:26.820]   It's because they're independently wealthy trust fund yepers.
[01:30:26.820 --> 01:30:28.820]   And they're given ambien before everybody else.
[01:30:28.820 --> 01:30:29.820]   Amazing.
[01:30:29.820 --> 01:30:31.820]   I love how the string goes on there.
[01:30:31.820 --> 01:30:32.820]   That's cool.
[01:30:32.820 --> 01:30:33.820]   Yeah, that's cool.
[01:30:33.820 --> 01:30:34.820]   Just open it up.
[01:30:34.820 --> 01:30:35.820]   Start tapping away.
[01:30:35.820 --> 01:30:36.820]   Start dropping.
[01:30:36.820 --> 01:30:37.820]   That's it.
[01:30:37.820 --> 01:30:43.820]   I'd like to thank everyone's families because they support us and let us do what we love to do.
[01:30:43.820 --> 01:30:44.820]   Thanks for coming.
[01:30:44.820 --> 01:30:45.820]   No more things.
[01:30:45.820 --> 01:30:46.820]   No one more thing.
[01:30:46.820 --> 01:30:47.820]   Right to your Apple TV.
[01:30:47.820 --> 01:30:48.820]   And now we're adding video here.
[01:30:48.820 --> 01:30:49.820]   Well maybe the cover.
[01:30:49.820 --> 01:30:52.820]   We're going to go to our live view in just a moment.
[01:30:52.820 --> 01:30:55.820]   Andy Inato will be emerging from that door.
[01:30:55.820 --> 01:30:58.820]   He'll be taking his iPad to test drive.
[01:30:58.820 --> 01:31:01.820]   Here's the first people going into the demo room.
[01:31:01.820 --> 01:31:02.820]   See the police officer?
[01:31:02.820 --> 01:31:05.820]   He's there specifically to look for Leo Le Porte
[01:31:05.820 --> 01:31:09.820]   and make sure that he and his minions do not enter the room.
[01:31:09.820 --> 01:31:13.820]   That police officer will soon be chasing Andy Inato as he runs out with an iPad too.
[01:31:13.820 --> 01:31:15.820]   Trying to escape.
[01:31:15.820 --> 01:31:21.820]   This is the promotional video they showed at the end of the event.
[01:31:21.820 --> 01:31:24.820]   You can see it on the Apple website.
[01:31:24.820 --> 01:31:28.820]   Now you understand why we're talking about nothing for so long now.
[01:31:28.820 --> 01:31:33.820]   He's running over to the demo room right now.
[01:31:33.820 --> 01:31:36.820]   Look, everybody's wearing vans.
[01:31:36.820 --> 01:31:41.820]   That gives you how many are supposed to control in multiple dimensions.
[01:31:41.820 --> 01:31:42.820]   And it'll allow...
[01:31:42.820 --> 01:31:46.820]   Sarah Lane acting nonchalant waiting for the signal to run in and steal an iPad too.
[01:31:46.820 --> 01:31:51.820]   These new components and features add all kinds of possibilities when it comes to our...
[01:31:51.820 --> 01:31:52.820]   I like...
[01:31:52.820 --> 01:31:53.820]   You know, I can see the weight is kind of...
[01:31:53.820 --> 01:31:54.820]   ...the kitchen.
[01:31:54.820 --> 01:31:55.820]   ...we haven't compromised...
[01:31:55.820 --> 01:31:56.820]   Good for the kitchen.
[01:31:56.820 --> 01:31:58.820]   The new iPad still gets a full 10 hours.
[01:31:58.820 --> 01:32:01.820]   Is that the evil assistant vampire from being human?
[01:32:01.820 --> 01:32:02.820]   Where?
[01:32:02.820 --> 01:32:03.820]   There?
[01:32:03.820 --> 01:32:05.820]   With all that we've added to iPad too, a thinner, lighter design.
[01:32:05.820 --> 01:32:06.820]   Amazing.
[01:32:06.820 --> 01:32:07.820]   I don't know how to go.
[01:32:07.820 --> 01:32:08.820]   I don't know how to go.
[01:32:08.820 --> 01:32:09.820]   Front and rear cameras.
[01:32:09.820 --> 01:32:12.820]   Let's keep saying the store is up and the store is not up for me.
[01:32:12.820 --> 01:32:13.820]   Is it just me?
[01:32:13.820 --> 01:32:19.820]   The white does look sterile, but that matches the white of the softbox that everybody's sitting in.
[01:32:19.820 --> 01:32:24.820]   And I think that iPad too will really define that category for years to come.
[01:32:24.820 --> 01:32:32.820]   So let's go to the event that is now ended at...
[01:32:32.820 --> 01:32:34.820]   ...Eurbubweina Center.
[01:32:34.820 --> 01:32:38.820]   You can see the people are filing out of the event and going over to the demo room.
[01:32:38.820 --> 01:32:41.820]   We're hoping Andy Inaco will go to the demo room as well.
[01:32:41.820 --> 01:32:47.820]   And tell Andy I'll fire up my FaceTime if he wants to call on FaceTime or he can call on Skype either way.
[01:32:47.820 --> 01:32:54.820]   Yeah.
[01:32:54.820 --> 01:32:55.820]   There we go.
[01:32:55.820 --> 01:32:56.820]   All right.
[01:32:56.820 --> 01:32:59.820]   The announcement is over and now we're sort of in the back of Yerubweina.
[01:32:59.820 --> 01:33:03.820]   So the way that this works is everybody's filing out of the announcement area
[01:33:03.820 --> 01:33:07.820]   and then walking over to this next building over here which is the demo area, the hands-on area.
[01:33:07.820 --> 01:33:10.820]   So everyone can play with this iPad too.
[01:33:10.820 --> 01:33:12.820]   The black, the white, see the thinness.
[01:33:12.820 --> 01:33:14.820]   Thinner than an iPhone 4.
[01:33:14.820 --> 01:33:16.820]   So that's pretty darn thin.
[01:33:16.820 --> 01:33:19.820]   A couple things that stood out to me about this announcement.
[01:33:19.820 --> 01:33:20.820]   I was following along on my...
[01:33:20.820 --> 01:33:25.820]   I thought I was watching the Engadget live vlog which was done very well by the way.
[01:33:25.820 --> 01:33:30.820]   No, I was iPhone 5 which was sort of a pie in the sky.
[01:33:30.820 --> 01:33:33.820]   Hope that a few of us had that, you know, might be the one more thing.
[01:33:33.820 --> 01:33:35.820]   There was no one more thing.
[01:33:35.820 --> 01:33:43.820]   Also, I noticed that 4.3 only appears to apply to the GSM iPhone.
[01:33:43.820 --> 01:33:51.820]   Now, my timing is really impeccable because I just went out and got myself the Verizon CDMA iPhone 4 yesterday.
[01:33:51.820 --> 01:33:53.820]   Not 24 hours ago.
[01:33:53.820 --> 01:33:58.820]   So kind of annoyed about that but, you know, we'll see what the details are on that.
[01:33:58.820 --> 01:34:06.820]   But my initial reaction is, however, iPad 2 itself looks pretty great, doesn't it?
[01:34:06.820 --> 01:34:08.820]   White and black, Ben.
[01:34:08.820 --> 01:34:10.820]   You're twice as fast.
[01:34:10.820 --> 01:34:12.820]   Same price, same battery life.
[01:34:12.820 --> 01:34:13.820]   And Andy not goes here.
[01:34:13.820 --> 01:34:14.820]   Come over Andy.
[01:34:14.820 --> 01:34:15.820]   Hi Andy.
[01:34:15.820 --> 01:34:17.820]   No, you're not interrupting me.
[01:34:17.820 --> 01:34:18.820]   You kidding?
[01:34:18.820 --> 01:34:21.820]   No, okay, I'm just talking about this like a door because I wasn't even inside.
[01:34:21.820 --> 01:34:23.820]   Wow, how do you feel in there?
[01:34:23.820 --> 01:34:24.820]   It felt pretty good.
[01:34:24.820 --> 01:34:30.820]   The underlying message, not only iPad 2 was a big revolutionary new update, but the big message from Steve Jobs was,
[01:34:30.820 --> 01:34:33.820]   "You people, you think you're competing with the iPad?
[01:34:33.820 --> 01:34:35.820]   You were never competing with the iPad.
[01:34:35.820 --> 01:34:38.820]   You're not going to use a letter in our name in your product."
[01:34:38.820 --> 01:34:41.820]   Obviously, addressing all these Android tablets that are coming out.
[01:34:41.820 --> 01:34:48.820]   I think it's the "he just started punching right out of the box saying about 5 minutes, about 6-65,000 apps for the iPad
[01:34:48.820 --> 01:34:52.820]   and put up a little graphic about how many Android tablet apps and...
[01:34:52.820 --> 01:34:53.820]   100.
[01:34:53.820 --> 01:34:54.820]   So it's the game is on.
[01:34:54.820 --> 01:34:57.820]   Yeah, I mean they were really, I mean they didn't just hint at the competition.
[01:34:57.820 --> 01:35:00.820]   I mean they had their logos up, they were calling them out by name.
[01:35:00.820 --> 01:35:01.820]   Exactly.
[01:35:01.820 --> 01:35:06.820]   And even the iPad versions of GarageBand and iMovie, they're going to be great apps,
[01:35:06.820 --> 01:35:07.820]   or it looks like they're not fun to do.
[01:35:07.820 --> 01:35:10.820]   Play with, they're going to be really, accidentally, you can do with it.
[01:35:10.820 --> 01:35:17.820]   But they're also a really strong message of "show me one app that's even fractionally like this on a Google tablet and then we'll talk."
[01:35:17.820 --> 01:35:20.820]   Well on 5 bucks a pop, I mean they're obviously very affordable.
[01:35:20.820 --> 01:35:27.820]   It kind of seems like it's awful saying "listen" to everyone who said that this is a consumption device and not a creation device.
[01:35:27.820 --> 01:35:28.820]   Think again.
[01:35:28.820 --> 01:35:29.820]   Absolutely.
[01:35:29.820 --> 01:35:34.820]   And you definitely don't get that same sort of vibe when you take a look at the Motorola's demos for the Zoom,
[01:35:34.820 --> 01:35:38.820]   T-Mobile's demos for the HTC device that they have.
[01:35:38.820 --> 01:35:46.820]   They're trying to find a middle ground between a busy productive executive device and a busy executive production device that can play music.
[01:35:46.820 --> 01:35:52.820]   This is another salvo saying "nope, buy it for your kids, buy it for your parents, buy it as a home computer, we're good."
[01:35:52.820 --> 01:35:56.820]   So what was the vibe in there when Steve got up on the stage?
[01:35:56.820 --> 01:36:00.820]   I mean everyone hoped he would arrive, but no one really knew until moments before.
[01:36:00.820 --> 01:36:03.820]   Big, big cheers from the whole house.
[01:36:03.820 --> 01:36:07.820]   At these events there's always a section that has VIPs and people from Apple, then there's the media place.
[01:36:07.820 --> 01:36:12.820]   And you can always kind of suss it out not only by the seating, but also where the cheers are coming from any given moment.
[01:36:12.820 --> 01:36:15.820]   But when he stepped out, everybody was really, really happy to see him.
[01:36:15.820 --> 01:36:17.820]   And also he looked like he was in fine federal.
[01:36:17.820 --> 01:36:24.820]   I didn't see much difference between his performance this time and from any other Apple event in the past year, year and a half since he had his surgery.
[01:36:24.820 --> 01:36:30.820]   I admit that I was also looking to see when he introduced the first video, is he going to go way, way off stage?
[01:36:30.820 --> 01:36:34.820]   No, he was just right, right at the range to the Superwater, staying the whole way.
[01:36:34.820 --> 01:36:38.820]   And he was just as strong at the end of the event as at the start and he was staying the whole way.
[01:36:38.820 --> 01:36:40.820]   So hopefully that's good news for himself.
[01:36:40.820 --> 01:36:44.820]   So, IPAT2 should be in March 11th, so that's next Friday.
[01:36:44.820 --> 01:36:50.820]   Same price points as the original iPad and same battery life, so they claim.
[01:36:50.820 --> 01:36:53.820]   I mean, which of the most exciting part of this announcement would be?
[01:36:53.820 --> 01:36:54.820]   A lot of it sounds pretty good.
[01:36:54.820 --> 01:36:57.820]   Well, obviously, the lighter is better, same better.
[01:36:57.820 --> 01:37:02.820]   We always wanted improvements across the board, but I don't think any of us who are IPAT users would want to give up anything.
[01:37:02.820 --> 01:37:03.820]   And we pretty much didn't.
[01:37:03.820 --> 01:37:13.820]   But there again, there was another table on the presentation where they threw a few punches saying that we sell exactly one iPad that's more expensive than the Motorola Zoom
[01:37:13.820 --> 01:37:17.820]   and everything else, and Motorola can't seem to come anywhere close to something for $4.99.
[01:37:17.820 --> 01:37:20.820]   So obviously it was really important to them that they didn't give up any ground.
[01:37:20.820 --> 01:37:30.820]   I think that if they had this announcement with the release of the new MacBooks last week, for instance, they reduced the battery life, but also mentioned that by the way we changed our test protocol.
[01:37:30.820 --> 01:37:33.820]   It really does have the same battery life, but we're being more honest.
[01:37:33.820 --> 01:37:37.820]   I tend to think that they would not have let anything honest.
[01:37:37.820 --> 01:37:43.820]   Without making anything up, I don't think they would have let anything say that our battery life has been reduced on the iPad.
[01:37:43.820 --> 01:37:50.820]   Because again, they do not want to let any argument come in that there is any advantage to not getting an iPad if you were to have a computer.
[01:37:50.820 --> 01:37:54.820]   Right, but I mean, the battery life iPad users, for the most part, are pretty happy with them.
[01:37:54.820 --> 01:37:57.820]   I mean, I know when my iPad's fully charged, I'm good to go for a while.
[01:37:57.820 --> 01:38:00.820]   But the processing is now faster with the same battery life.
[01:38:00.820 --> 01:38:03.820]   So it's like, even though the battery life didn't change, it is better in a way.
[01:38:03.820 --> 01:38:15.820]   Yeah, not only that they're promising twice the speed with the A5 processor, but also making a big deal about the new graphics chip that has nine times, according to them, the performance, which may be sort of like you kind of note the number and sort of move on.
[01:38:15.820 --> 01:38:26.820]   But then they gave the demo a FaceTime for a photo booth for iPad, where they have, if you've used it on the desktop, you know that they'll give you live previews of the effects about the choose.
[01:38:26.820 --> 01:38:33.820]   They had nine live video windows simultaneously, each one having a different effect being processed in real time.
[01:38:33.820 --> 01:38:36.820]   We're not just talking about O-Look at sepia, O-Look is purple.
[01:38:36.820 --> 01:38:42.820]   We're talking about face warping and pinching and zooming effects, all like full frame rate, absolutely not a single drop frame.
[01:38:42.820 --> 01:38:47.820]   And that's when I kind of took my hands off the keyboard and thought, man, this is one fast machine.
[01:38:47.820 --> 01:38:55.820]   If they can do that, not just for, not really just for anything important, but just, we just thought that it would be cool to see at 30 frames per second exactly what these stupid effects are going to look like.
[01:38:55.820 --> 01:38:58.820]   Yeah, these people are kind of proud of what they're doing.
[01:38:58.820 --> 01:38:59.820]   Cool, cool.
[01:38:59.820 --> 01:39:08.820]   So you're about to go into the demo area where you'll have some hands on time, and I believe the plan is that you'll then FaceTime into a Macbreak Weekly from the number one.
[01:39:08.820 --> 01:39:14.820]   I'm going to ask those people very nicely, if it's okay for me to stream from there, if I can, then we'll be seeing some video, hopefully.
[01:39:14.820 --> 01:39:15.820]   Cool, alright.
[01:39:15.820 --> 01:39:18.820]   Well, Andy, enjoy your time in there.
[01:39:18.820 --> 01:39:22.820]   And I'm jealous, but I take a lot of pictures, you know, report back.
[01:39:22.820 --> 01:39:23.820]   We'll do.
[01:39:23.820 --> 01:39:24.820]   Alright.
[01:39:24.820 --> 01:39:25.820]   Good, Andy.
[01:39:25.820 --> 01:39:33.820]   Andy and I co-sera lane at the event, and Andy's going to go in that room there and take a look at the new iPad.
[01:39:33.820 --> 01:39:40.820]   Let's recap, and then as soon as we can get ahold of Andy, how is Andy going to, Eileen, how is Andy going to contact us, Skype?
[01:39:40.820 --> 01:39:46.820]   Okay, well, I have both fired up so he can just do whatever he does, and we'll pull it up when it comes.
[01:39:46.820 --> 01:39:53.820]   So, and they may say no, we may ask, we may be able to get our live view cameras in there. If we can, we will.
[01:39:53.820 --> 01:39:59.820]   We have our camera live view camera out there. Live view is that great technology, that backpack technology.
[01:39:59.820 --> 01:40:00.820]   Sarah's still talking.
[01:40:00.820 --> 01:40:02.820]   Just happy that no one is out.
[01:40:02.820 --> 01:40:05.820]   I'm sorry, Sarah. Sarah's just kind of chatting away.
[01:40:05.820 --> 01:40:09.820]   There's Robert Scobull doing an interview with somebody from the media.
[01:40:09.820 --> 01:40:10.820]   That's revision three.
[01:40:10.820 --> 01:40:11.820]   Is that revision three?
[01:40:11.820 --> 01:40:16.820]   So, our cameras are out there. Live view allows us to do that via 3G.
[01:40:16.820 --> 01:40:20.820]   So, it breaks up a little bit, as you can see from time to time, but it's pretty amazing.
[01:40:20.820 --> 01:40:21.820]   Yeah.
[01:40:21.820 --> 01:40:22.820]   Pretty mellow.
[01:40:22.820 --> 01:40:29.820]   Haven't seen any of the usual suspects of the live waters, probably still wrapping up on the side.
[01:40:29.820 --> 01:40:30.820]   But some...
[01:40:30.820 --> 01:40:33.820]   Sarah will grab, we'll keep an eye on Sarah, she'll grab somebody.
[01:40:33.820 --> 01:40:40.820]   One of the unfortunate limitations of the live view is because of stream latency, we aren't able to actually have a two-way conversation with her.
[01:40:40.820 --> 01:40:42.820]   But...
[01:40:42.820 --> 01:40:45.820]   No, I would have given revision three credit site for Mag. I just didn't know it was AM.
[01:40:45.820 --> 01:40:47.820]   Yeah, I just didn't recognize Graham.
[01:40:47.820 --> 01:40:49.820]   You know him because you work with him.
[01:40:49.820 --> 01:40:50.820]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:40:50.820 --> 01:40:55.820]   So, once again, to recap, there is a new iPad, iPad 2. It will be available 5 p.m.
[01:40:55.820 --> 01:40:59.820]   Local time at your Apple store on March 11th, a week from Friday.
[01:40:59.820 --> 01:41:06.820]   It will be the same price and the same storage, but we'll have some new features, including front and rear facing cameras.
[01:41:06.820 --> 01:41:11.820]   Cameras, cameras that can work at 720p, FaceTime camera on the front.
[01:41:11.820 --> 01:41:14.820]   It will be a lot thinner, about a third thinner.
[01:41:14.820 --> 01:41:24.820]   We'll also have white and black faces, new processor, dual core, A5, Apple's calling it.
[01:41:24.820 --> 01:41:29.820]   We believe it's based on the ARM Cortex-A9 processor.
[01:41:29.820 --> 01:41:32.820]   And they say nine times faster graphics performance.
[01:41:32.820 --> 01:41:36.820]   We'll have to see on that. Same battery life.
[01:41:36.820 --> 01:41:38.820]   Same battery life.
[01:41:38.820 --> 01:41:42.820]   Anything else did I miss? Any other specs?
[01:41:42.820 --> 01:41:48.820]   No, that's pretty much the meat of it. It starts at $499. Oh, it's a little bit lighter.
[01:41:48.820 --> 01:41:52.820]   It's 1.3 pounds instead of 1.5 pounds.
[01:41:52.820 --> 01:41:57.820]   And I guess the biggest nifty thing you'll be able to do with it is deliver video
[01:41:57.820 --> 01:42:08.820]   either through an HDMI cable at 1080p, that cable cost you $39, or the ability to stream through AirPlay, your apps.
[01:42:08.820 --> 01:42:12.820]   That was very interesting.
[01:42:12.820 --> 01:42:15.820]   The full-time mirroring video plus kind of two-way.
[01:42:15.820 --> 01:42:20.820]   You can use AirPlay to get to the TV from the iPhone and vice versa.
[01:42:20.820 --> 01:42:22.820]   I think that's pretty cool.
[01:42:22.820 --> 01:42:30.820]   I'm just going to sit and watch Sarah and see if she snags anybody, and I'll keep an eye out for Andy.
[01:42:30.820 --> 01:42:35.820]   They did tell us we couldn't bring our cameras into the facility.
[01:42:35.820 --> 01:42:39.820]   So we won't be able to stream it via LiveView.
[01:42:39.820 --> 01:42:43.820]   Sarah Lane is out there with the LiveView.
[01:42:43.820 --> 01:42:47.820]   4.3 aspect ratio, exactly the same screen resolution as before.
[01:42:47.820 --> 01:42:56.820]   UK Apple Store is cutting the price of its existing iPad Model 1, so maybe you will be able to get a deal on the Model 1.
[01:42:56.820 --> 01:43:01.820]   But why would you buy it if, knowing that for the same price, they'd have to be considerably cut?
[01:43:01.820 --> 01:43:03.820]   Yeah, no, they'd have to cut that.
[01:43:03.820 --> 01:43:09.820]   What's a shame is that they did so much promotion at Christmas for the iPad.
[01:43:09.820 --> 01:43:12.820]   I mean, I bought my mom an iPad.
[01:43:12.820 --> 01:43:17.820]   Yep, everyone bought everyone an iPad for Christmas and now they're just like...
[01:43:17.820 --> 01:43:18.820]   Well, that's frustrating.
[01:43:18.820 --> 01:43:25.820]   That's the thing about an early year release is that by the holiday season, it's nine months old.
[01:43:25.820 --> 01:43:27.820]   I mean, it's still great.
[01:43:27.820 --> 01:43:33.820]   I mean, if I wasn't so into sort of the whole camera aspect, I mean, I still love this one.
[01:43:33.820 --> 01:43:37.820]   And, you know, I'm not giving up on you.
[01:43:37.820 --> 01:43:42.820]   100% sort of certain that I need to abandon this one either.
[01:43:42.820 --> 01:43:48.820]   The cameras are very cool and I love the idea that you can export through HDMI.
[01:43:48.820 --> 01:43:53.820]   I guess that's not going to be available on the old one, but not 100% certain on that either.
[01:43:53.820 --> 01:44:01.820]   Well, they aren't going to offer that 4.3 upgrade to everybody, but I think that's a hardware feature, not a software feature.
[01:44:01.820 --> 01:44:05.820]   Oh, it looks like we got Robert Skobel to talk to Sarah out there.
[01:44:05.820 --> 01:44:07.820]   The main is out in the field.
[01:44:07.820 --> 01:44:08.820]   We got a task over there.
[01:44:08.820 --> 01:44:09.820]   And there's Robert's belly.
[01:44:09.820 --> 01:44:13.820]   You're like, "Oh, you're good. Are you like on a diet?"
[01:44:13.820 --> 01:44:14.820]   Yeah.
[01:44:14.820 --> 01:44:16.820]   Speaking of Robert's belly.
[01:44:16.820 --> 01:44:17.820]   Did you bring it?
[01:44:17.820 --> 01:44:20.820]   Because you're wearing a belt or something, so you just...
[01:44:20.820 --> 01:44:21.820]   I don't know.
[01:44:21.820 --> 01:44:22.820]   No, it's not.
[01:44:22.820 --> 01:44:24.820]   Sarah's really sucking up at this point.
[01:44:24.820 --> 01:44:27.820]   I don't know what I'm here with, none of that, then Robert's going, "Well, Robert, how are you?"
[01:44:27.820 --> 01:44:28.820]   Hey, doing really well.
[01:44:28.820 --> 01:44:29.820]   So, what is you?
[01:44:29.820 --> 01:44:33.820]   What's your... you just came out of the event. What's your vibe? What are your thoughts?
[01:44:33.820 --> 01:44:41.820]   I like it, but it's not a revolutionary device. It's not the high-res screen that we were like, "Oh, is it that, you know, 2,000 pixels green coming?"
[01:44:41.820 --> 01:44:45.820]   We know it's coming. I have sources. You say they're working on one in China.
[01:44:45.820 --> 01:44:49.820]   It's just... is it coming this year? It's not coming in the next month or so.
[01:44:49.820 --> 01:44:53.820]   But you knew that walking into this event that you wouldn't get it.
[01:44:53.820 --> 01:45:00.820]   Yeah. And I... you know, I like listening to Gruber's sources better than I like listening to some of the other rumors.
[01:45:00.820 --> 01:45:07.820]   He was pretty damn accurate. Two cameras, a little bit faster, a little bit thinner, well a lot thinner, a third thinner.
[01:45:07.820 --> 01:45:15.820]   Looks nice, but it's not not a mind-blowing, you know, new thing. It's not like I've had one came out of it.
[01:45:15.820 --> 01:45:19.820]   Wow, okay. The higher speed does look interesting.
[01:45:19.820 --> 01:45:29.820]   I really want to test it with my 5D and see if I can actually use it to edit video, other than just an iPad video, but a real video, you know, from a real camera, like the ones you guys use.
[01:45:29.820 --> 01:45:35.820]   And if it can do that, that'll be interesting, but otherwise it's just for the iPad generation.
[01:45:35.820 --> 01:45:43.820]   You know, I was following some of your comments area on Twitter and you were like, "Ooh, I'm moving. This could be really great because my videos go straight to YouTube."
[01:45:43.820 --> 01:45:49.820]   I mean, they've definitely improved the way that I move in. Garagemen were 5 bucks a pop. Pretty cool.
[01:45:49.820 --> 01:45:56.820]   Now, and it shows where I think Apple's going next, which is... Okay, we got the consumption thing down. You can play games.
[01:45:56.820 --> 01:46:06.820]   You can watch Netflix on it. You can, you know, get your blogs and Twitter and all that stuff, you know, Flipboard. It's great for that.
[01:46:06.820 --> 01:46:11.820]   Now, let's take the Slate form factor into something that you can actually create content on.
[01:46:11.820 --> 01:46:16.820]   And it'll be interesting to see how they move into it. Clearly, it's getting faster.
[01:46:16.820 --> 01:46:19.820]   And so now is it up to that challenge.
[01:46:19.820 --> 01:46:27.820]   What did you think of the new iPad cover? The original case, you know, no one had anything too nice to say about it, but this cover is very intriguing.
[01:46:27.820 --> 01:46:33.820]   It's just the front and it turns it on and off from sleep as you open it.
[01:46:33.820 --> 01:46:39.820]   I like it. The video that's up on Apple.com is really, really cool. You know, it's fun.
[01:46:39.820 --> 01:46:44.820]   It looks like a piece of plastic that just lays on the thing and snaps in with a little magnet.
[01:46:44.820 --> 01:46:54.820]   I don't know. I have to play with it to see if it really fits my lifestyle. I've been using different cases for different things and that I'm sure that'll be true on the iPad too as well.
[01:46:54.820 --> 01:47:07.820]   So you had mentioned again in your tweet stream that what you were most blown away by was the way that Steve Jobs introduces features, products, and the way he keeps the audience riveted.
[01:47:07.820 --> 01:47:17.820]   Well, it's not just riveted. I was thinking because everything he says on stage is quotable and he doesn't stumble the way I just did.
[01:47:17.820 --> 01:47:34.820]   He is so clear on communication and that's a gift that very few people, I mean I interview lots of CEOs and very few CEOs can, every sentence they say, can be a little tweet and can be pulled out and used to augment what they're saying.
[01:47:34.820 --> 01:47:38.820]   It's a real skill that I wish other CEOs had.
[01:47:38.820 --> 01:47:45.820]   So you sound like it was a good presentation, good time, fun, but you're not going away?
[01:47:45.820 --> 01:47:51.820]   No, I don't think it was one of those, you know, they didn't have a band at the end. They didn't have one more thing.
[01:47:51.820 --> 01:47:59.820]   The demos went a little long. The GarageBand video demo went, was starting to get, "Oh man, this is going long."
[01:47:59.820 --> 01:48:05.820]   Even though it's cool, it's going long, which means they were stretching it out trying to fill in some air space.
[01:48:05.820 --> 01:48:10.820]   And that tells you that this was an unmind-blowing, you know, revolutionary thing.
[01:48:10.820 --> 01:48:16.820]   This was just, we're updating the iPad coming out with the thinner, faster, and cameras.
[01:48:16.820 --> 01:48:24.820]   It did seem like the GarageBand demo, while cool, it was a little curious. It was kind of like, you don't have to have any skill in order to play the guitar.
[01:48:24.820 --> 01:48:28.820]   And it was kind of like a child babysitter type of the...
[01:48:28.820 --> 01:48:33.820]   When I was watching that, Apple did something that no other company really does.
[01:48:33.820 --> 01:48:41.820]   They show aspirational uses of these technologies. It's like, "Oh, if you buy an iPad, now you can do a little band thing."
[01:48:41.820 --> 01:48:44.820]   Or you can hold your iPad up at the stars and look at the stars.
[01:48:44.820 --> 01:48:48.820]   Or your kid can play something and learn something.
[01:48:48.820 --> 01:48:57.820]   They're marketing and they're messaging is very aspirational. That's very different than most of the other PC kind of companies.
[01:48:57.820 --> 01:49:05.820]   I mean Steve Jobs, when he shows a tablet, or I'm sorry, Steve Bomber when he shows a tablet or a computer, you don't get that aspirational kind of thing.
[01:49:05.820 --> 01:49:12.820]   We're going to bring you into a new world. We're going to expand what you can do with these kinds of things.
[01:49:12.820 --> 01:49:15.820]   Jobs to his credit always does that.
[01:49:15.820 --> 01:49:21.820]   Does that in the stores? Does that on the commercials? Does that at press events? And that's pretty rare in this industry.
[01:49:21.820 --> 01:49:27.820]   What did you think about some of the more obvious months looming against the competitors?
[01:49:27.820 --> 01:49:35.820]   I think it's deserved. I have a Motorola Zoom in my backpack here. It has no apps. It has 16 apps.
[01:49:35.820 --> 01:49:39.820]   And it doesn't do anything like what they're showing on stage.
[01:49:39.820 --> 01:49:43.820]   You go down the line, banky app. Sorry, it's on the iPad.
[01:49:43.820 --> 01:49:48.820]   Games. It's on the iPad. clipboard. It's on the iPad.
[01:49:48.820 --> 01:49:58.820]   Group for Xbox newest thing. It's on the iPad. On and on and on and on. It's on the iPad. It's not on the Android or on the HP touchpad, which I really like.
[01:49:58.820 --> 01:50:03.820]   I love that hardware. The team did a good job. Basically they stole the team from Apple.
[01:50:03.820 --> 01:50:11.820]   The ponded and then HP bought Pong. And it's nice stuff. But no apps. No apps. No apps. No sales.
[01:50:11.820 --> 01:50:15.820]   You have great advice about all the development community.
[01:50:15.820 --> 01:50:23.820]   I'm interviewing a ton of developers for South by Southwest. I know you guys are going to be there right in force.
[01:50:23.820 --> 01:50:27.820]   Saturday and Sunday will be streaming all over the place. I'm sure you'll be part of it.
[01:50:27.820 --> 01:50:29.820]   If I'm sober.
[01:50:29.820 --> 01:50:35.820]   Crowd surfing. No crowd surfing for Sko-lo. No, they dropped me.
[01:50:35.820 --> 01:50:40.820]   But he says no. They keep lee on a lot. That's good.
[01:50:40.820 --> 01:50:45.820]   But I'm interviewing a lot of developers and they're all going on iPad. iPhone, iPad.
[01:50:45.820 --> 01:50:49.820]   I mean I'm playing with Yobongo that's coming out in the morning.
[01:50:49.820 --> 01:50:56.820]   iPhone. Jitto, which was invented by the guy who ran social at Google.
[01:50:56.820 --> 01:51:00.820]   iPhone. iPhone. On and on.
[01:51:00.820 --> 01:51:06.820]   The developers are going iPhone, iPad. First then moving to Android to get the scale.
[01:51:06.820 --> 01:51:10.820]   And then they look around and go well is there anything else left to do maybe next year.
[01:51:10.820 --> 01:51:14.820]   And that's going to be a real tough thing for HP and RAM.
[01:51:14.820 --> 01:51:18.820]   Well RAM is trying to bet on the Android apps. We see if they can really make those work.
[01:51:18.820 --> 01:51:23.820]   Because we know every time we see something run in a in a shim or on a virtual machine.
[01:51:23.820 --> 01:51:27.820]   It doesn't quite run the same as it does on the native hardware.
[01:51:27.820 --> 01:51:31.820]   And so RAM has a tough, I remember the room executive this morning.
[01:51:31.820 --> 01:51:35.820]   It's like, you guys are tough, bro the hell of you.
[01:51:35.820 --> 01:51:40.820]   What do you think about iOS 4.3 only being available on the GSM?
[01:51:40.820 --> 01:51:42.820]   Oh it's on the...
[01:51:42.820 --> 01:51:45.820]   It appears, I mean nobody has said that explicitly.
[01:51:45.820 --> 01:51:48.820]   Although of course they have gloss over it if that was true.
[01:51:48.820 --> 01:51:53.820]   But up on the slide yet said 4.3 GSM i3.
[01:51:53.820 --> 01:51:56.820]   I got both.
[01:51:56.820 --> 01:52:02.820]   That's the question I'll definitely ask when I get in there and do some demos.
[01:52:02.820 --> 01:52:10.820]   There were some other things people wanted to know what slots were on the iPad and how that new HDMI controller.
[01:52:10.820 --> 01:52:14.820]   Not controller but dongle works.
[01:52:14.820 --> 01:52:20.820]   And you got to get some demos to see all that stuff and also find out the real specs on the cameras.
[01:52:20.820 --> 01:52:22.820]   Alright well I'll let you get in there.
[01:52:22.820 --> 01:52:24.820]   Robert Scobble, thanks so much for talking to Twitch.
[01:52:24.820 --> 01:52:26.820]   Yeah thanks Leo.
[01:52:26.820 --> 01:52:28.820]   See you at South By.
[01:52:28.820 --> 01:52:29.820]   Alright.
[01:52:29.820 --> 01:52:31.820]   Yeah you bet.
[01:52:31.820 --> 01:52:34.820]   Robert Scobble, the scobelizer.
[01:52:34.820 --> 01:52:35.820]   Thank you very much.
[01:52:35.820 --> 01:52:36.820]   Thank you.
[01:52:36.820 --> 01:52:38.820]   Thank you Sarah Lane.
[01:52:38.820 --> 01:52:40.820]   Great, he never stops.
[01:52:40.820 --> 01:52:44.820]   So we've got a few eyewitness accounts.
[01:52:44.820 --> 01:52:49.820]   Andy was pretty excited to scobble.
[01:52:49.820 --> 01:52:53.820]   Yeah, excited but was looking for that one more thing that he didn't get it.
[01:52:53.820 --> 01:52:55.820]   So you are up to date.
[01:52:55.820 --> 01:52:57.820]   Everything else is going to happen inside there.
[01:52:57.820 --> 01:53:00.820]   So we're going to go ahead and toss back to you folks.
[01:53:00.820 --> 01:53:04.820]   And the next you see from us will be hands on demoing.
[01:53:04.820 --> 01:53:05.820]   Thank you Sarah Lane.
[01:53:05.820 --> 01:53:08.820]   Out there at the Irba Buena Center for the Arts.
[01:53:08.820 --> 01:53:11.820]   You're watching live coverage of Apple's IP.
[01:53:11.820 --> 01:53:13.820]   I think we can say it now.
[01:53:13.820 --> 01:53:15.820]   And we have a bunch of people here.
[01:53:15.820 --> 01:53:16.820]   And we have a bunch of people here.
[01:53:16.820 --> 01:53:19.820]   And the next thing we're going to do is we're going to do a little bit of video.
[01:53:19.820 --> 01:53:21.820]   We're going to do a little bit of video.
[01:53:21.820 --> 01:53:24.820]   We're going to do a little bit of video.
[01:53:24.820 --> 01:53:26.820]   I'm going to do a little bit of video.
[01:53:26.820 --> 01:53:27.820]   I'm going to do a little bit of video.
[01:53:27.820 --> 01:53:29.820]   I'm going to do a little bit of video.
[01:53:29.820 --> 01:53:31.820]   I'm going to do a little bit of video.
[01:53:31.820 --> 01:53:32.820]   I'm going to do a little bit of video.
[01:53:32.820 --> 01:53:34.820]   And we're going to do a little bit of video.
[01:53:34.820 --> 01:53:35.820]   I'm going to do a little bit of video.
[01:53:35.820 --> 01:53:36.820]   And I'm going to do a little bit of video.
[01:53:36.820 --> 01:53:37.820]   And I'm going to do a little bit of video.
[01:53:37.820 --> 01:53:38.820]   I'm going to do a little bit of video.
[01:53:38.820 --> 01:53:39.820]   I'm going to do a little bit of video.
[01:53:39.820 --> 01:53:44.820]   And that's a fun show.
[01:53:44.820 --> 01:53:45.820]   And we're currently just kind of work shopping it.
[01:53:45.820 --> 01:53:46.820]   Yes.
[01:53:46.820 --> 01:53:52.820]   We're trying to get a feel of what the audience wants and how we can best sort of get this
[01:53:52.820 --> 01:53:53.820]   knowledge across to people.
[01:53:53.820 --> 01:53:54.820]   So participate.
[01:53:54.820 --> 01:53:55.820]   Join in 4pm.
[01:53:55.820 --> 01:53:59.820]   And I'll show you my new Nokia N8, which I love that we do that.
[01:53:59.820 --> 01:54:01.820]   We did that with frame rate seemingly forever.
[01:54:01.820 --> 01:54:04.820]   It's a great way to do it with the Android show too.
[01:54:04.820 --> 01:54:06.820]   Where we just go on and say, this is the kind of thing we talk about.
[01:54:06.820 --> 01:54:07.820]   What do you think?
[01:54:07.820 --> 01:54:08.820]   What do you like?
[01:54:08.820 --> 01:54:09.820]   I really like how that's worked with the Android show.
[01:54:09.820 --> 01:54:13.820]   It's really developing as a show based on what the audience wants.
[01:54:13.820 --> 01:54:15.820]   And I'd love to do.
[01:54:15.820 --> 01:54:16.820]   You started it and I'd like to do more of it.
[01:54:16.820 --> 01:54:17.820]   I think it's a great thing to do.
[01:54:17.820 --> 01:54:20.820]   You should show all the iPad tweets coming in.
[01:54:20.820 --> 01:54:22.820]   Oh man, it's nonstop.
[01:54:22.820 --> 01:54:25.820]   I've got tweet deck up and not far right.
[01:54:25.820 --> 01:54:27.820]   Column is just a search for the word iPad.
[01:54:27.820 --> 01:54:28.820]   He's not scrolling.
[01:54:28.820 --> 01:54:30.820]   That's just refreshing.
[01:54:30.820 --> 01:54:33.820]   And the Tom, when I was at Tom, was not moving.
[01:54:33.820 --> 01:54:36.820]   That is one of those paid for tweets.
[01:54:36.820 --> 01:54:38.820]   I'm not a fan of the audio.
[01:54:38.820 --> 01:54:40.820]   I'm not a fan of the audio.
[01:54:40.820 --> 01:54:42.820]   I'm not a fan of the audio.
