[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.080]   Netcast you love.

[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.520]   There's his Macbreak Weekly episode 539
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:34.800]   for Tuesday, December 27, 2016, the year's best.
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.760]   Hello, everybody.
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.000]   I hope you had a great holiday.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.080]   Happy New Year.
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.280]   You see, I'm dressed already for the party.
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.720]   And today we have a very special Macbreak.
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.440]   Some of the highlights of the year 2016.
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.920]   And a lot of you submitted some great ideas.
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:48.800]   And I thank you.
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.320]   And we have some wonderful, wonderful shows.
[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.440]   We're going to do this kind of in chronological order.
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.800]   Starting early in the year with, I think, probably
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.480]   the biggest story of the year from an Apple point of view.
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.960]   By the way, I kind of lost track at time.
[00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.600]   This was March.
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.400]   This was in March.
[00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.840]   We talked about the Apple versus the Department of Justice
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.360]   and why protecting the privacy of your iPhone
[00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.880]   is so very important.
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.240]   Watch.
[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.680]   Now I have to say, I understand what the president is saying.
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.400]   Why shouldn't there be--
[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.720]   why should you have anything that with a duly appointed subpoena
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.760]   or warrant from a law enforcement and a court,
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.280]   why should you have anything that can't be searched?
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.880]   The only thing we have right now that can't be searched
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.040]   is our brains.
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.240]   They've carved that out.
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.840]   By the way, that's only by precedent.
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.520]   They've carved that out.
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.960]   Well, and that's--
[00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:46.480]   there are--
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:47.000]   Fifth Amendment.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.680]   I mean, one can argue that even that is a fuzzy area.
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.280]   They can't prosecute you against a polygraph.
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.480]   But they oftentimes will ask for one.
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.920]   And oftentimes--
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:57.840]   Well, they would like to break it.
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.520]   If they could break it into our brains reliably,
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.320]   don't you think that would be the next thing?
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.440]   They're less than a decade away.
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.000]   So they're less than a decade away.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.280]   And someone argued that they're less than a couple years away.
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.120]   That to being able to have a pretty good idea of what
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.040]   you're thinking, maybe not be able to get it verbatim,
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.440]   but have enough information to really very cleanly
[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.960]   know whether you're telling the truth or not.
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.440]   The much more accurate than a polygraph.
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.080]   So the issue that I think that you get into
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.680]   is that there's this connection between our phone and us
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.720]   is so much different than anything
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.360]   that's ever been there before.
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.280]   It's really--
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.960]   I think it's more than your diary if you keep one.
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.480]   Because it's just so--
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.280]   Well-- there's so much of what you do that's in there.
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.480]   And I think that's the thing that makes this--
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.400]   It's not even that.
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.720]   --more complicated than a warrant.
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.840]   The reason why Lauren Fuxman wants in here
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.400]   is it has a GPS, a microphone, and a camera.
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.800]   What's that?
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:54.960]   I mean, all these things--
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.440]   So we don't need to tell you anymore
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.760]   because we know exactly where you are.
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.040]   We can just turn on your microphone.
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.600]   Yeah, we don't need to bug you anymore
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.720]   because you're carrying a bug.
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:02.680]   How can I save you?
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:03.440]   And we have a warrant.
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.560]   We can just have Apple Flip that switch and your phone is live.
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.280]   So in one way, I think one argument--
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.720]   if I'm the president, one argument I would make is, well,
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.640]   if you choose to carry a surveillance device in your pocket,
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.360]   that's your choice.
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.080]   And as law enforcement, if we are with probable cause
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.840]   and court order investigating a crime,
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.000]   shouldn't we have access to that surveillance device?
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   You choose to carry in your pocket.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.320]   Well, I think it's like Slaton said,
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.120]   propose that law, pass that law, and then have someone--
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.920]   and then that law can be challenged constitutionally.
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.240]   But there's been no process.
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.240]   Right.
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.640]   Like with a lot of things recently,
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.840]   the rush to get what they want is superseding
[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:39.640]   the due process--
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.480]   Oh, I'm going to beg to differ.
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.760]   I think this is very deliberate and premeditated.
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.680]   And they finally came up with a strategy that I think
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.120]   is a good move.
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.640]   Good move.
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.200]   Because we know that Apple was working with them
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.920]   since the fall, right, in private.
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:54.720]   While some--
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:55.160]   And for years.
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.000]   Not just since the fall, for years.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.600]   For years.
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.200]   But even, well, since the fall with the San Bernardino case
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.160]   specifically, or in early December.
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.360]   And so we knew that they were giving them information.
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.040]   They had given all sorts of data related to that case.
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.800]   All kinds of backups related to that case.
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.560]   And then suddenly, the FBI goes public with this.
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.600]   This is a boon for law enforcement,
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.360]   because I have already in my house Amazon,
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.680]   Echos, Xbox, One, and the Samsung TV, all of which
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.920]   have microphones that are connected to the internet.
[00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.800]   And if they can get the right to ask any tech company
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:36.720]   for firmware that has a law enforcement backdoor in it,
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.920]   there's nowhere I have that I could be private.
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:40.920]   Right.
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.200]   What about your canary or your nest?
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.200]   Right.
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.360]   Having access to the camera drop.
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.040]   I think this is what happened is law enforcement
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.200]   scratched their head and said, you know, what do we need?
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.520]   What would be the perfect solution?
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.640]   Oh, just a law that's a Kalia for digital technology.
[00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.160]   Kalia says that telecom companies have
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.680]   to assist law enforcement.
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.120]   What we need is a Kalia for digital technology that says,
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.560]   you have to assist law enforcement.
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.480]   I mean, I think everyone saw it.
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.160]   But last week, there was also--
[00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.240]   I forget the details of it.
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.920]   But they were basically making it overt policy that NSA
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.840]   could pass along the information they collect.
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:13.840]   Yeah.
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:14.640]   So the law enforcement as well.
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:15.680]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:16.680]   Geez.
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.400]   I mean, sorry to swear, but this deserves it.
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.160]   That's horrific.
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.280]   And I think that they're clear that Congress has no appetite
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:25.600]   for this.
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.600]   After SOPA and PIPA, Congress has no appitating right on this
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:29.120]   pack.
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.120]   They've tried on this pack.
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.760]   They've turned away everything.
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.160]   And Congress doesn't want to play this.
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.440]   I mean, this is not--
[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:35.160]   They don't now.
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.280]   And this is where Tim Cook's genius was.
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.720]   Because until Tim Cook said no, this wasn't in the public
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:42.080]   awareness.
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.400]   It is now, isn't it?
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:43.560]   Yeah.
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:43.920]   Absolutely.
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.800]   Well, and I think we can fully expect
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.400]   it to be more in the public awareness on Monday
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.120]   when Apple comes up.
[00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.520]   15 minutes is my guess.
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:52.520]   They're going to spend time on this.
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.760]   It's going to be dedicated during that event.
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.000]   The day before, the day before, they
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.560]   have to defend it, they're going to make their case
[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.360]   in front of millions of people watching that live feed
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.600]   and all the press that it's going to get.
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.080]   And I think that they're going to keep on pushing this down
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:07.560]   the path.
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.760]   And I think that it is going to make any kind of--
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:13.640]   the issue is that the people who understand what the danger is,
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.960]   they are very active.
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.440]   And then the rest of the population
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:18.640]   kind of doesn't understand it.
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:23.040]   It's not as important to them as taxes or law and order
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.440]   or a general law and order or abortion or whatever
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:26.560]   those things are.
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.040]   They're much more committed to that
[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.480]   than whether their phone's encrypted or not.
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:33.440]   And so it makes it very unpalatable for Congress
[00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.840]   to go down that path.
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.960]   So this is kind of a Hail Mary, because I think
[00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.280]   that the law enforcement has decided
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:40.640]   that they can't win in Congress.
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:42.240]   And so there's no reason to wait for that
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.480]   or try to push that down the path.
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:44.320]   This is their chance.
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.280]   And they know-- the risk that they have
[00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.680]   is they lose this in the Supreme Court.
[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.560]   It's over.
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.600]   And it will shut.
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.360]   Because now they've created a space race.
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.240]   I mean, you've got Facebook, Google.
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.280]   All these companies are now ramping up for encryption.
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:04.720]   If the FBI loses this case and why
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.280]   it's kind of dangerous for them to go down this path,
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:13.280]   if they lose this case, the entire communication
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.840]   industry will be locked out for them.
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:18.320]   Well, it's interesting, because it's
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.880]   the way you ask the question in polls.
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:23.800]   Do you want terrorists to be able to keep their data private
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:24.800]   in an investigation?
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.160]   No, of course not.
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:26.920]   Oh, OK.
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:29.400]   Do you want the government to know exactly where your kids
[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:32.120]   are located and your health records made public
[00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.800]   and the government to have access to your private photos,
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.440]   emails, information, health data, et cetera?
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:38.280]   Oh, hell no.
[00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:39.480]   I don't want that.
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:42.880]   So it's this split between what Leo,
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.680]   what you were talking about earlier, this idea that, yeah,
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:45.920]   we want law enforcement, right?
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:48.080]   We want these protections, the rule of law.
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:52.040]   But do you want an armored Humvee at a pumpkin festival
[00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:55.280]   in New Hampshire for Mildred's pumpkin festival
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:57.480]   and tanks that are rolling in to protect us
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:00.320]   against the off chance that someone is going to bring a bomb
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:03.840]   to Mildred's pumpkin festival in the fall?
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:05.200]   And you're seeing this--
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:06.600]   We're getting close to that, by the way.
[00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:07.960]   Well, it's every site where there
[00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:09.400]   were enough Humvees--
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:10.320]   I think there would be.
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:13.640]   This is every dystopian future movie that we watched.
[00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:15.880]   And these are the bad guys from those movies
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:18.000]   and the classic arguments every time.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.160]   And it's not a movie now.
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:19.800]   It's real life.
[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.800]   And we sort of didn't learn these last time.
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.640]   And again, and I often say this,
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:26.760]   I don't want to get in a quote, an argument against government.
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:28.440]   That's an argument that could be had.
[00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:29.880]   And I'm not saying it shouldn't be had.
[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:31.360]   But that's a separate argument.
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:34.080]   Then whether in a nation of laws,
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:36.520]   there should be a law preventing encryption.
[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.040]   And what would be the--
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:39.240]   I think the real question.
[00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:40.400]   And Tim Cook has brought this up.
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:41.320]   And it's very smart of him.
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.080]   And this is where Apple should hit.
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:45.840]   What would be the consequences of such a law?
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:48.880]   It would, in fact, improve our safety or not.
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:51.320]   And I think it's so clear that it would not.
[00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:54.200]   And the history is there that it would not.
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:57.480]   But that's the point Apple needs to continue to hammer home.
[00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:59.360]   I suspect they will on Monday.
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:00.440]   Hey, am I saying your name wrong?
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:01.120]   Somebody tweeted me.
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:03.160]   I said, say Renee.
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:04.600]   No, you're not saying it wrong, Leo.
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.720]   I mean, if you're in Quebec, you say Renee.
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:08.160]   But I mean, that's totally-- no one does that.
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:09.520]   I'm saying it Quebecois.
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:12.280]   I'm saying with the accent on the name, not the Ren.
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:13.480]   No, you're doing fine.
[00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:14.360]   OK.
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:15.680]   My sister's middle name was Renee.
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:16.760]   And I always say Renee.
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:18.240]   Yeah, totally perfect.
[00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:19.640]   Not Renee.
[00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:20.600]   No.
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:22.520]   He said the French class, they taught us
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:26.480]   that the man is Renee and the woman is Renee.
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:27.160]   Yeah.
[00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:29.480]   When I was born in South Africa, it'd be Renee.
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:29.960]   Renee.
[00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:30.960]   Renee.
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.120]   Renee.
[00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:32.620]   Renee.
[00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:34.880]   Tell me the Quebecois proper renunciation again.
[00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:36.960]   Renee.
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:37.960]   OK.
[00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:38.960]   Renee.
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:39.960]   Renee.
[00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:40.960]   Rishi.
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:41.960]   [SPEAKING FRENCH]
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:42.960]   Renee.
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:43.960]   Excellent.
[00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:44.960]   [SPEAKING FRENCH]
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:45.960]   Close the bar.
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:46.960]   [SPEAKING FRENCH]
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:47.960]   [SPEAKING FRENCH]
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:48.960]   [SPEAKING FRENCH]
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:49.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:50.960]   [SPEAKING FRENCH]
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:51.960]   [SPEAKING FRENCH]
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.960]   We're so international, it's amazing.
[00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:54.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:55.960]   I can't speak French.
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:57.960]   I just-- this is everything like this.
[00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:58.960]   [SPEAKING FRENCH]
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:09:59.960]   [SPEAKING FRENCH]
[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:00.960]   Le le part.
[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:01.960]   [SPEAKING FRENCH]
[00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:02.960]   [SPEAKING FRENCH]
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.960]   Let's talk a little bit about the car.
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:07.880]   One of the venues at Apple perhaps is looking
[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:08.880]   for a new market.
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:13.720]   And there's been a lot of stories about Apple going to Germany of all places.
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:15.240]   They have an office there, right?
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.520]   The office is all over the place now.
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:18.520]   It's amazing.
[00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:20.520]   But an office is designing cars.
[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:21.520]   Yeah.
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:22.520]   [SPEAKING FRENCH]
[00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:25.000]   They have offices designing cars all over the place?
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.200]   Well, I mean, the cars are going to be interesting to roll out because it's not just
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.200]   like a computer or a phone.
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:33.840]   They're going to have to get FDC approval absolutely, but to put any significant car
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:37.240]   on the road, it takes a lot of interfacing with those countries.
[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:42.000]   Apparently, Daimler had been talking with Apple about an I car.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:49.200]   And according to Huntles Blot, which I just like saying the name of, Huntles Blot, Daimler
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:52.640]   rejected Apple's overture to jointly design a car.
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:54.920]   So did BMW.
[00:10:54.920 --> 00:11:00.080]   So the German manufacturers apparently are not interested in partnering.
[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:01.680]   Well, I mean, this is the very similar.
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:06.600]   Verizon turned Apple down when they wanted to, you know, Apple had this idea of this
[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:09.240]   phone and they wanted to control-- it's the same thing.
[00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:11.520]   They wanted to control the user experience.
[00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:12.520]   They wanted to control the data.
[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:14.920]   And Verizon was like, no, no one's going to do that.
[00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:15.920]   Yeah.
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:19.840]   And at the time, Apple was not known for being able to make something like a smartphone,
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:22.680]   but they certainly were able to show that they could do that.
[00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:24.440]   But the phone is not a car.
[00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:28.080]   Apple-- I mean, building a car might be a challenge, yes?
[00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.080]   Or no?
[00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:31.760]   No, I think it's definitely-- I mean, I think they're both very complex.
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:32.760]   You know, so--
[00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:34.560]   I think the reason before the iPhone is--
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:40.840]   Well, is a car less complex than an iPhone?
[00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:44.600]   I think the issue is that the stakes are higher.
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:46.600]   So when your iPhone crashes, it's not as big of a deal.
[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:47.600]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:48.600]   So I think that--
[00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:49.600]   Well, there's a lot more metal.
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:52.280]   There's a lot more-- I mean, it's more expensive to build a car.
[00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:53.840]   But not as more systems.
[00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:54.840]   Yeah.
[00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:59.000]   Yeah, an extra aluminum has to be-- is regulated, and each one is a safety thing.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:06.480]   But also, it's about they don't know how a person-- a consumer reacts to a consumer
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:08.560]   product that they climb into.
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:12.720]   They know how to design something that people hold onto and put in their pockets and have
[00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:14.520]   that sort of contact with.
[00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:19.320]   But a person's relationship with a car is a really special thing that they have to really
[00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:21.280]   get worked out.
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:25.440]   And there's so-- as with any time we talk about Apple Car Rumors, there's really almost
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:26.960]   any reason for anything.
[00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:32.720]   One of them could be that they hired a team that could deliver expertise that they didn't
[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:33.720]   have.
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:37.080]   But this team said, yeah, we really don't want to live in California.
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:41.600]   We want to live here where all of our-- where all of our kids are in school.
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:43.520]   And also, we have the resources that we need.
[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:49.480]   You're going to buy us a nice pretty building with one of those hot and cold water dispensers.
[00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:53.880]   And we're not moving.
[00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:57.640]   I think they're probably emboldened by Tesla because Tesla had no experience building
[00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:58.640]   a car either.
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:03.640]   Of course, it took them 10 years, but Apple's willing to go for a long time.
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:12.160]   And I think that also the pre-orders for the new Tesla tells you that there's pent-up
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:16.400]   interest in something other than what is coming out of Detroit, or Japan, or anything else.
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:17.400]   I mean, it's the first--
[00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:18.880]   And the first Tesla was a Lotus, wasn't it?
[00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:19.880]   It was.
[00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:22.840]   It was a Lotus Elite that they just made the drive train.
[00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:24.360]   And so they did it incrementally.
[00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:26.480]   They learned how to do that.
[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:31.840]   And then they made a very, very expensive Model S and then a very, very expensive Model
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:37.760]   X. And then they started looking at-- was there planned along a more affordable--
[00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:39.200]   You know, Apple helped make a razor.
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:41.800]   And then they made an iPhone that had no 3G and no GPS.
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:42.800]   And then they made a big version.
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:43.800]   Yeah, I see.
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:46.800]   When you're talking about the razor, you're talking about that horrific iTunes phone.
[00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:47.800]   Yeah.
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:48.800]   That was terrible.
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:49.800]   It was terrible.
[00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:50.800]   It was terrible.
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:51.800]   The rocker.
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:52.800]   The rocker.
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:53.800]   Whee.
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:59.280]   Well, I didn't-- how much did they help make it?
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:04.440]   I think they just-- didn't they just like write code for the chipset that would actually
[00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:06.960]   let it play content for iTunes?
[00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:08.720]   From plays, yeah, fair play.
[00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:09.720]   But it was--
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:14.640]   Clearly, it was designed to get them a toe in the water, right?
[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:16.840]   To kind of understand this business, I would bet.
[00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:18.320]   Which is sort of like car play, too.
[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:19.320]   Yeah, I think--
[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:25.440]   I think we know from people who have been interviewed since then that jobs hated that
[00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:26.440]   phone.
[00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:31.240]   It's hard to get-- it's hard to get any indication that they develop-- Apple decided to develop
[00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:34.680]   that phone with the idea that they're going to have a partnership with Motorola.
[00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:39.800]   So it's possible that they did-- it is certainly possible that they did it with the idea that
[00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:44.480]   we're going to have close-- a close relationship with Motorola and we can ask them lots of questions
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:45.480]   and get asked.
[00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:49.240]   Because they're trying to woo us into making a special phone for them.
[00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:55.200]   They will give us all kinds of data that we-- that only Motorola has about markets, about
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:59.640]   penetration, about networks, about efficiencies that will help us build an iPhone.
[00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:00.640]   I wouldn't be surprised at all that.
[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:03.440]   There's also that fear that Alex was talking about where you see that people's music listening
[00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:08.280]   is moving from unilateral-- a unit-tasker iPods to multitasker converged devices and
[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:11.440]   people are carrying their phones and will they want to carry a phone and an iPod?
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:14.840]   So if you start getting onto phones, even if it's rudimentary in the beginning, it's
[00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:16.800]   the same way you can start getting into cars.
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:19.080]   You know, through a car play system, it helps.
[00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:21.720]   It helps move them into the general ecosystem better.
[00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:22.720]   I don't know.
[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:26.840]   I mean, I think it gets them into the social ecosystem, which is valuable.
[00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:33.080]   A lot is-- it's underestimated how important it is to just have your executives and your
[00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:37.240]   engineers socializing with and talking to executives and engineers from other industries
[00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:41.200]   and other companies because that's how you get a really deep understanding about how a
[00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:43.160]   certain business works.
[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:49.080]   I don't know exactly the reasons for doing the rocker phone, particularly I didn't understand
[00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:50.680]   after I started using the rocker phone.
[00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:53.400]   I got my loaner unit.
[00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:54.880]   But I don't know.
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:58.640]   It's also possible they're trying a flag about if we don't know what we're going to do with
[00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:02.080]   phones yet, we're definitely developing something we don't know what we want to do yet.
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:06.000]   Let's try on an experimental basis what it would be like to write software for someone
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.400]   else's hardware product.
[00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:15.240]   Like, could we simply add iTunes functionality and create something like CarPlay for phone
[00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:19.880]   devices so that if anybody wants to have iTunes compatibility, we will quickly be able
[00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:22.920]   to build them what they need for that.
[00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:23.920]   Who knows?
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:27.760]   But there's just so many variables associated with this.
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:33.200]   Building a car is going to be so difficult, not just because of the complexity of the
[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:36.880]   actual thing they're trying to build, but of who Apple is.
[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:42.560]   Apple is an unfounded, when they started making cars, they were a brand new company that never
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:43.640]   shipped anything.
[00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:48.960]   So they could make a huge win by simply saying, we're going to build you a really expensive
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:53.520]   luxury sports car that accelerates like stink.
[00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:57.560]   It's like you will blow everybody else off the line with this because it's a purely electric
[00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:58.560]   car.
[00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:03.920]   And also, if you are a true car nut, if you are a true motor nut, we will give you a really
[00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:08.000]   cool electric car that doesn't look like it started off with a golf cart or something
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.520]   bought at Toys R Us.
[00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:13.680]   Then they built that into, we're going to build a luxury car that's a practical sedan
[00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:18.880]   that's also going to be appealing to people who A, have lots of money and B, are going
[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:22.360]   to appreciate being one of the first to have a practical electric car.
[00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:23.560]   And now it's three or four generations.
[00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:25.720]   And they could just build and platform as they go.
[00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:29.840]   What would happen if Apple creates an Apple car?
[00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:34.280]   They are not designed to design it with the intention of selling to consumers.
[00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:40.160]   And they designed it the way they designed the Mac Pro where, okay, we've built you a
[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:43.160]   cylinder, a tube.
[00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:47.800]   And we're going to try to impress you with the cooling system because we know that the
[00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:52.120]   thing that you really gets you all excited about spending $3,000 on a powerful computer
[00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:55.600]   is the cooling system and this wonderful tubular shape.
[00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:59.600]   And the rest of the car people are going to be like, we absolutely don't care about
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:03.320]   the manufacturing process you came up with for making those fenders.
[00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:07.920]   We don't give one quarter of a dam that how much we saw how much recyclable materials
[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.800]   are going into the tires.
[00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:12.440]   We'd use this to drive to work every single day.
[00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:17.480]   We spent two and a half stinking hours on stinking I 93 every four, five stinking days
[00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:19.920]   a week to try to get to work and back.
[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:23.840]   And you have given us something where whenever we tell you that this is not this isn't good
[00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:26.760]   for us, we don't enjoy this or we think this is ugly.
[00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:31.240]   But you want to show us a video of a head on a white background talking about chamfer
[00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:32.240]   angles.
[00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:37.520]   Yeah, but I think that I think that the fighting the battleground for cars I think is pretty
[00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:38.680]   well defined at this point.
[00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:41.520]   And that is that they have to be self-driving, they have to be electric.
[00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:45.720]   I think that there's definitely a market there that in somewhere that wants the other stuff
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:47.680]   the one that drive their own and have gas cars.
[00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:50.320]   But the growth market is in those two areas.
[00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:53.360]   And I think that everybody knows that at that point what Apple has to do is implement
[00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:56.040]   that well and then they can add all the design.
[00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:59.520]   And I think that that is where we're going to continue to see growth.
[00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:03.120]   And right now it's very disruptive because you've got a bunch of manufacturers that are
[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:05.920]   trying to figure out they're in the same place that Apple's in.
[00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:10.720]   So if you look at Detroit or you look at Japan, they're trying to figure out in Germany,
[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:15.260]   how do I move into the new market that I know I have to be in but I can't figure out how
[00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:17.360]   to get out of the market that I'm in.
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:19.960]   And I think that that's going to be something that we're going to see.
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:25.520]   So it is a disruptive moment where if Apple is going to get into this market, it's going
[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:29.120]   to be in the next, I think probably the next five or six years.
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:30.640]   I don't think it needs to be any faster than that.
[00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:35.080]   But I think that after that, I think we look 10 years down the road and it's going to be
[00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:37.000]   mostly electric and mostly self-driving.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.240]   I think that because I think people have, especially when you see that groundswell of
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.960]   what happened with Tesla, people don't want to drive anymore.
[00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:48.480]   They want to text and they don't want their hands to smell like gas.
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:50.240]   I don't think it has anything to do with it.
[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:54.760]   But boy, that's really living in the future because there's a whole lot of, I mean, it's
[00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:58.680]   easy for us to say, "Oh, this is exciting," but that's years off.
[00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:00.800]   Well, it's not that far off.
[00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:01.800]   I think it's far off.
[00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:04.320]   I'm buying one.
[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:07.520]   I'm not saying I'm not into it, but I feel like that's going to be a long way off.
[00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:09.880]   Well, let's just say the people who buy new cars.
[00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:14.240]   When you're looking at where is your next market going to come from and how is that
[00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:15.920]   going to look?
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:19.480]   There's definitely a group of people, probably your largest group of people that are going
[00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:22.000]   to buy them for their own individual use.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.280]   They're going to be looking for them.
[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:29.520]   I think that my kids are older than 16 and my older kids are older than 16 and they have
[00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:31.920]   no interest in driving.
[00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:34.840]   They drive a little bit here and there, but it's not interesting.
[00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:37.440]   It makes the car makers cry.
[00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:39.640]   They don't want to drive.
[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:44.040]   They don't identify themselves with their car the way we did when we were younger.
[00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:46.960]   They identify themselves with their Facebook page.
[00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:51.320]   It's a much different view and that is what's coming.
[00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:57.040]   I think that it's a huge shift and it creates the instability that's required to move into
[00:20:57.040 --> 00:21:01.880]   the market in a way that hasn't been available for the last 20 or 30 years.
[00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:05.320]   Well, I hope you're enjoying this travel down memory lane.
[00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:11.040]   It's funny you forget, maybe it's just maybe the year goes so fast, you forget that these
[00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:13.400]   things happen in the spring.
[00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:16.520]   We're going to move ahead a little bit.
[00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:18.320]   This one is not from the spring.
[00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:24.160]   This is right after you have to cast your mind back to September, all the way back to September.
[00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:29.320]   Right after the Apple was it?
[00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:34.400]   No, it was the Apple September event announcing the iPhone 7, right?
[00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:40.400]   And I'm sorry, but I still laugh when I think about it.
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:44.280]   Remember that the iPhone 7 did not have, still does not have, don't try to make one of your
[00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:45.880]   own a headphone jack.
[00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:49.960]   Bill Schiller said all it took was courage.
[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:55.240]   Bill Schiller surprised me at the very beginning of the event and I've been saying this for
[00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:56.240]   a couple of days.
[00:21:56.240 --> 00:22:01.520]   I said the most interesting thing will be to hear how Apple spins this, how Apple explains
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:09.800]   why they are removing the headphone jack, a well known widely used, open as a non-proprietary
[00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:15.840]   connector in favor of a connector that is owned by Apple must be licensed for anybody
[00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:17.720]   else to use.
[00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:21.800]   I mean, the cynic in me would say, well, there's one word, profit.
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:24.720]   The word Phil Schiller chose was courage.
[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:25.720]   Yeah.
[00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:33.160]   I've already received how many times have I received yet the picture of Burtlar in the
[00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:36.880]   in the in the garage with that courage and then with Phil Schiller's face on it.
[00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:38.120]   Right now it's up to five.
[00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:39.120]   Wow.
[00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:40.560]   It didn't take much time.
[00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:41.560]   What do you think?
[00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:43.600]   Is that a reasonable rationale?
[00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:45.920]   Why what what courage is involved?
[00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:46.920]   None.
[00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:50.360]   Courage to take a lot of abuse from the.
[00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:51.360]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:52.840]   Or even to lose sales.
[00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:55.960]   Do you could it costs Apple sales?
[00:22:55.960 --> 00:23:01.040]   It'll only cost Apple the sales from people who were already thinking really hard about
[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:05.520]   switching to Android anyway or people who didn't have that much of a connection to the
[00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:06.520]   iPhone to begin with.
[00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:12.120]   I think that they have hard numbers to demonstrate internal that reminds them that people are
[00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:15.200]   if there's a reason why someone is going to not buy the iPhone 7.
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:18.720]   It's not going to be because they deleted the headphone port for it.
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:22.000]   It's something that just like the the crummy keyboards on a lot of the back books, it's
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.560]   something that people will sigh and get used to because they're not going to hate it as
[00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:29.720]   much as they're going to hate switching to an entirely new operating system and entirely
[00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:32.600]   new piece of hardware and rebying a whole bunch of apps.
[00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:36.200]   So that was I mean, they had two good reasons after that.
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:41.680]   So that was just that was the other thing, but that was the headline that was the that
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:42.680]   was number one right.
[00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:46.520]   Yeah, that was the thing that I think is that it may actually I don't think it would really
[00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:51.360]   prompt people to not buy the iPhone 7 exactly.
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:56.000]   It may prompt people to delay the purchase because they have to think about it sort of
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.320]   like, Oh, well, but how am I going to do this and how am I going to do that?
[00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:01.440]   I just have to I just have to think about all this stuff.
[00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:06.320]   So, you know, people may be putting it off longer and longer possibly even for another
[00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:11.360]   generation as they work through what their issues are going to be.
[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:15.160]   Apple does does going to is Apple will.
[00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:16.920]   I shouldn't have had that spice smoke.
[00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:18.880]   That's clear clear now.
[00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:24.400]   Apple did say they will include a $9 dongle in the box that will convert right into analog
[00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:27.080]   and that's that's good because it's only $9.
[00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:31.240]   I mean, Apple often charges over charges for these dongle.
[00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:32.240]   Including in the box.
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:33.240]   I mean, it's free.
[00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:34.240]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:35.240]   Everyone will get one.
[00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:37.240]   And they'll include a pair of lightning headphones.
[00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:38.240]   Right.
[00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:39.240]   They couldn't they couldn't change that.
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:40.240]   They have.
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:43.960]   And also, and also the pricing of them if you want to if you once you lose them or with
[00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:47.280]   them through the wash, it's going to be 29 bucks for replacement.
[00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:51.280]   I think that's about the same as what the regular wired ones cost were not if it's more.
[00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:52.680]   It's not that much more.
[00:24:52.680 --> 00:25:00.240]   Yeah, but the one thing that that does hurt though is the people who lose them constantly,
[00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:04.040]   break them constantly and actually like, you know, in essence cheap headphones.
[00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:07.360]   You know, you can get a pair of decent headphones for six bucks on Amazon if you're the sort
[00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:09.280]   of person who goes through them.
[00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:10.280]   And that's not.
[00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:12.800]   And by the way, those six buck ones aren't much worse than $30 ones.
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:13.800]   I mean, right.
[00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:14.800]   Right.
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:15.800]   Right.
[00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:20.800]   But the issue is going to be that even if that company, the six dollar company wants
[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:24.120]   to sell lightning based headphones, it's going to cost them five bucks.
[00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:25.120]   Just the license.
[00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:28.120]   I don't know what the fee is, but something like five bucks is it they're going to need
[00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:30.200]   they're going to need to do the made for iPhone program.
[00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:31.200]   Yeah.
[00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:33.680]   And that's expensive and that's expensive and complicated.
[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:36.520]   And you have to have, you know, suppliers who were approved.
[00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:41.880]   I was talking to a manufacturer of wireless sensor tags, you know, like home kit type
[00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:42.880]   stuff.
[00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:43.880]   And I said, is this going to be home?
[00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:45.840]   Could avail home kit compatible?
[00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:48.640]   And they said, no, because it's just too expensive.
[00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:51.920]   Home kit also requires MFI certification.
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:53.400]   And it's just too expensive for us.
[00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:55.560]   We don't have enough reason to do it.
[00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:56.560]   Yeah.
[00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:57.560]   Yeah.
[00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:01.200]   And also remember, it's just a lack of the ability to choose the headphones that you
[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:02.200]   really, really want.
[00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:06.920]   If you're, if there's a punishment for not buying and into the Apple standard and that
[00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:11.400]   is having to keep track of this $9 dongle, which it's going to happen, you're going
[00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:17.400]   to be unless you, unless you get to get a bit of a Subaru and just glue it to the end
[00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:20.360]   of your lightning based headphones, you are going to lose this.
[00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:24.480]   You're going to be in a place where you cannot plug in to the device that you, you can, if
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:27.080]   you're using old headphones, you're going to be in a situation where you cannot use
[00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:30.000]   the headphones you want to use, or you're going to have to find an Apple store and show
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.400]   up nine bucks.
[00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:35.880]   And just like me with the cup with a VGA daffers on my iPad, I now have three of them
[00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:39.920]   because of times where I was in a city and could not, I thought I had it, but I didn't
[00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:43.360]   so I'd have to find an Apple store and show out 30 bucks for another one of them.
[00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:47.520]   I mean, they did, I don't feel as though the world is going to come to an end.
[00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:49.400]   I just feel, I feel this is a neutral thing.
[00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:53.560]   The only time that I feel like I have to clear my throat and interrupt is when people
[00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:58.080]   say this is a brave and wonderful and important thing that Apple is doing because every, because
[00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:03.040]   they're also saying, the reason number two is that he mentioned.
[00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:07.640]   Phil Schiller said, and this, I just, it just made me queasy.
[00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:11.880]   Not merely that it comes down to courage, but the courage to move on to do something
[00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:14.320]   that betters all of us.
[00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:19.400]   Really, really, Phil, how does that better anybody except Apple's bottom line?
[00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:20.400]   Come on.
[00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:24.080]   And you want to courage bundle the air pods with every iPhone.
[00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:28.240]   That would be courageous and hard at the same time.
[00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:33.240]   But let me, but, but, but, but, uh, are, are not, uh, this is the other thing that concerns
[00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:34.240]   me.
[00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:39.600]   It strikes me that lightning, uh, cables are more fragile, that they do tend to break
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:41.600]   more than other cases.
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:42.600]   Here is the case.
[00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:47.720]   Here is the lightning cable that I have plugged into my iPad and it's yellow and I count on
[00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:48.960]   here's the end of it.
[00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:50.920]   It's starting to crack already.
[00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:52.840]   They're not really, they're not really good at that.
[00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:57.200]   And, and their difficulty is that I can't take the amount of money that I might spend
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:28:01.960]   on a pair of lightning headphones and apply that to a purchase someplace.
[00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:07.120]   I can't, I, I won't, I won't want to invest in $200 in a really, really nice pair of headphones
[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:12.120]   that I can only really use with this one set of devices.
[00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:18.040]   Uh, same thing with the ear pods, which is $170 for a really nice pair of Bluetooth
[00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:21.240]   headphones, particularly one that doesn't have like connecting wires between them.
[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:27.000]   Okay, I can see that, but no, you know, you will not be able to use, excuse me, information
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.440]   that I have right now, which is being realized, realize that I've been spending the last
[00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:36.120]   two hours talking into a micro camera, as opposed to calling engineers that I know.
[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:40.120]   Uh, the understanding that I have right now is that, I'm sorry, I need to backtrack that.
[00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:47.240]   The actual data sheet on it says that it requires a device that can run a 2016 version
[00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:50.160]   of iOS or, or Mac OS.
[00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:54.720]   So the watch, the Apple TV, your Mac, your iPhones, if it run iOS 10 for instance, it
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:55.720]   will run it.
[00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:58.280]   So it doesn't mean that I can take $160 and apply to one.
[00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:00.600]   I'm upgrading my audio experience everywhere.
[00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:05.480]   I spent, but are you, if you're still using Bluetooth, what's the upgrade?
[00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:11.160]   Uh, better audio supposedly, but if you want remains to be seen, we have to try them again.
[00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:12.800]   Again, remains to be seen.
[00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:18.200]   Uh, and also if you want better audio, you have to now convince these people.
[00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:24.240]   Okay, but here are, here are a pair of $180 headphones that I don't even necessarily need
[00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:26.440]   earbuds that are wireless that work for fitness.
[00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:28.000]   I just want great audio.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.600]   Now, if you're going to sell me a pair of $200 headphones that are wired that have really
[00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:37.360]   good drivers and a lot of air around them, are you willing to tell me that these wireless
[00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:41.120]   headphones you're selling me, that only works with Apple, are going to be better than these
[00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:45.520]   wired headphones that I can use with my desktop computer, with my Windows machine, with my
[00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:47.520]   home stereo.
[00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:48.520]   It's, it's easier.
[00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:53.040]   Is there an issue with the new wired headphones of charging and listening at the same time?
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:55.480]   Do people charge their phone and listen at the same time?
[00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:56.480]   Obviously you can't do it.
[00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:57.480]   Right.
[00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:58.480]   Yeah.
[00:29:58.480 --> 00:29:59.480]   No.
[00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:00.480]   Do they.
[00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:01.480]   Do people do that?
[00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:04.080]   I guess at night, maybe if you're charging your phone, you've gone to bed.
[00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:08.360]   Yeah, because if you're, if they say that you're running your, your, your audio through
[00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:10.360]   speakers, you know, and your bedside.
[00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:11.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:13.640]   So you would want to be charging your iPhone at the same time.
[00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:17.160]   I mean, I did think that the AirPods having a little charging case were clever.
[00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:18.160]   I was sorry.
[00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:19.160]   That was, that was.
[00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:20.160]   Yeah, they didn't invent that.
[00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:23.960]   My, my Moto Hint, Moto, Motorola Hints do the same thing.
[00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:29.120]   Any headphone that, you know, earbud that just has the battery in the earbud has so
[00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:32.360]   little space for battery that you just, it's not all day listening.
[00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:36.680]   So the solution is to have a larger case that has a battery on all day battery.
[00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:39.640]   And when you're done listening, you put them in there 15 minutes later, you can use them
[00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:42.080]   again, kind of like the Apple pencil.
[00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:44.480]   And so that, that, but that isn't anything Apple invented.
[00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:48.680]   That's frankly a necessity on anything with a tiny battery.
[00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:49.680]   So that's another issue.
[00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:54.080]   If you want to charge and listen, and I, I guess that that's a use case for some people
[00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:55.080]   that's gone.
[00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:56.080]   So that's gone.
[00:30:56.080 --> 00:31:00.000]   That's going to make a break, another breakout dongle that has, that will, that will have
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.040]   a lightning connector and an earphone connector, I think on it.
[00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:05.840]   And you buy this and don't worry, you will solve every problem you'll ever have with it.
[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:08.040]   But actually, you know, I do that, I do that on an airplane.
[00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:13.880]   I will plug in if I have, if I'm lucky enough to have a USB port, I will charge my phone
[00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:17.560]   because I'm going to listen the whole flight on a long overseas flight.
[00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:18.720]   And I will listen on the headphones.
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:21.960]   And that way I have an head, I have something to listen, something to use for a phone when
[00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:23.200]   I arrive.
[00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:25.160]   That's gone.
[00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:26.840]   Regardless, it looks like the way to go.
[00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:31.600]   But again, we'll just have to see with these earpods only because Bluetooth is such a poor
[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:33.640]   experience for most.
[00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:37.320]   As I've been, as I've said many times over the course of this year, as this rumor of
[00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:42.280]   now fact has gotten better traction, they have not said a single thing in their three
[00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:47.120]   reasons that meant that they could not put in a keep a headphone jack if they wanted
[00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:48.400]   one.
[00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:51.280]   So really, I wish you talk about real courage.
[00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:56.000]   Real courage is saying we simply don't want to keep making iPhones with headphone jacks.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.160]   And we know that this is going to annoy a lot of people who are very, very sensible.
[00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:05.520]   And we hope we don't lose them as customers, but we want to go our own way with this.
[00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:09.320]   As opposed to saying there is things that we can't do with a wired headphone jack.
[00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:14.400]   And we've been, the same stupid saw about it whipped out this photo of like telephone
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:15.400]   operators in the 1920s.
[00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:20.480]   We've been using the same connector for that really pissed me off because those were, that's
[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:22.240]   those aren't headphone jacks.
[00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:24.120]   That's a patch pay.
[00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:27.560]   And so the implication that we've been using headphone jacks as the turn of the century
[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:29.920]   defer operators is bogus.
[00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:31.920]   That's in fact, I thought that was iCloud.
[00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:32.920]   I think that was iCloud.
[00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:35.920]   iCloud looks like behind it.
[00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:40.520]   You know, that's still continues to, continues to impress me with his, well, he's a marketer.
[00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:45.920]   His willingness to kind of bend facts to suit the Apple stories is very, very annoying.
[00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:50.720]   I just, well, I just, I just think that there's a reason why it's been by putting, having
[00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:56.280]   a wired connector has been going on for centuries now, including, why isn't he railing against
[00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:57.520]   like the HDMI cable?
[00:32:57.520 --> 00:32:59.040]   Like, why isn't that wireless?
[00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:00.840]   Well, because does it work?
[00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:05.040]   Electrons are, if you, if you drop an electron down this end of this copper tube, it will
[00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:06.560]   shoot out the other end of that tube.
[00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:08.040]   And you don't have to configure it.
[00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:09.320]   You don't have to put a chip in it.
[00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:12.200]   It costs about as much as a length of copper wire.
[00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:14.680]   And so anybody can make it as an open standard.
[00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:19.760]   So that's why that's, there are a bunch of bogus arguments in favor of dropping the headphone
[00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:20.760]   jack.
[00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:21.760]   That's one of the bogus.
[00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:22.760]   Yeah.
[00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:25.720]   So the legitimate argument would be and Phil did make this argument that it's to save space
[00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:29.720]   inside the case space, though, that I imagine they immediately gave up by putting a second
[00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:32.960]   speaker on the iPhone.
[00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:33.960]   Now that's nice.
[00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:36.480]   Now we have stereo sound, left, right sounds.
[00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:41.400]   And the cutaway image they had of the, of the iPhone had a big block for the haptic engine
[00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:43.920]   that they're using to power the, to the, oh, that's right.
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:45.640]   You need a new haptic engine from the home.
[00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:46.640]   Everything's true.
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:47.640]   Everything's the truth.
[00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:48.640]   It's about the size of us.
[00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:51.360]   It looks to be the size of a stick of denting gum or tried and strictless gum.
[00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:52.600]   So maybe that's it.
[00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:57.040]   But, but again, these are not, these are problems that every phone manufacturer has and almost
[00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:59.160]   every phone manufacturer has solved.
[00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:03.800]   So it's just, again, I wish they had the, it's completely legitimate for Apple to say that
[00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:07.880]   we are the people who get to design the iPhone and we don't want to have a headphone jack
[00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:08.880]   anymore.
[00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:10.320]   And we have, we're not doing this capriciously.
[00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:15.600]   We feel as though we're giving all of our users and any new users plenty of options to
[00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:17.320]   a, we're accommodating them.
[00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:21.880]   But this is, we're making this decision first and foremost because we want to do this.
[00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:23.040]   That's real courage.
[00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:27.360]   So one of the other things that I thought was really, really cool about WWDC is Apple's
[00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:29.480]   continued focus on accessibility.
[00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:30.720]   And it didn't just end with the keynote.
[00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:33.840]   We did get a lot of features there like Siri for Mac.
[00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:36.680]   There were some features they didn't talk about like on the iOS 10, you can now use
[00:34:36.680 --> 00:34:40.880]   the camera as a magnifying glass and you can shift colors if you have different, your
[00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:42.480]   different visibility needs.
[00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:46.920]   But they also had continuous labs on accessibility across all of the platforms.
[00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:51.280]   And on the Wednesday, they had an accessibility meetup, which was, was remarkable.
[00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:54.040]   I mean, a couple of months ago, maybe it was just a month ago, Apple had it, they built
[00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:59.000]   an entire house inside one infinite loop inside the atrium where people from Apple could
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   come and learn about all the technologies, including Braille keyboards and Cochlear implants
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.880]   and Siri and HomeKit and all the different frameworks that they provide.
[00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:12.400]   And they did that on a smaller scale at WWDC where they had an area where the very talented
[00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:16.720]   Apple engineer who's blind and who did the DJing at the Apple Design Awards showed you
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:20.080]   sort of how he did the DJing with the DJ Pro app.
[00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:23.800]   And they had Cochlear implants you could put on your forehead and sort of feel how the
[00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:25.600]   bone connectivity worked.
[00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:28.280]   And they had various apps on display.
[00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:31.760]   They had the American Sign Language Association app and they were talking about how that
[00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:34.160]   was developed and sort of what you could learn from it.
[00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:41.080]   And I got to actually type with a Bluetooth keyboard to a Braille reader for the woman.
[00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:42.880]   And I'm going to blank on her name for a second.
[00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:47.720]   I just had it up here and I'll pull it up again who, um, Habin Girma, and I apologize
[00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:52.440]   if I'm mispronouncing that, who is blind and deaf and graduated from Harvard Law.
[00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:58.160]   But thanks to this sort of technology, she was not only at WWDC, but she spoke at WWDC.
[00:35:58.160 --> 00:35:59.600]   One of the best presentations ever.
[00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:03.560]   You just see her typing away and the presentation goes up and all of a sudden it's Obama who's
[00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:06.160]   talking to her, totally undersold it.
[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:10.400]   But I find Apple's continued focus on accessibility, not just in the technologies, but giving it
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:13.520]   actual time on stage and on the floor.
[00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:17.240]   I hope that's something that becomes more competitive because I'm a firm believer that
[00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:21.880]   when you make things more accessible in general, you make them more accessible for everybody.
[00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:26.520]   And I think this is definitely a, not just a focus for Apple, but a very, very intense
[00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:27.520]   focus from Tim Cook.
[00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:30.480]   I mean, I think that this is coming from the top down.
[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:32.720]   And I think that, um, he just very focused.
[00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:37.080]   I think that the more and more I watch, you know, after the years of after Steve Jobs,
[00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:41.840]   Steve Jobs got Apple to a certain point, but, but Tim Cook, I really feel is just an amazing,
[00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:45.840]   you know, next generation leader for Apple where there, he's paying attention to all
[00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:50.320]   those other little things that make a difference, whether it's accessibility, you know, in a
[00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:54.520]   lot of the political stances that Apple, you know, has decided to, to take one way or
[00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:55.720]   the other.
[00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:59.560]   But I think that, um, I think that he's very focused on it.
[00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:02.240]   And I think that accessibility is becoming a very important piece.
[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:07.160]   And I, and I think that Apple has been very good at being ahead of technology.
[00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:11.000]   And I, and what I'm glad to see is that they're also ahead of things like accessibility and
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.440]   they're setting the pace for everyone.
[00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:17.040]   You know, I think that, um, you know, we're going to expect to see, you know, um, closed
[00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:21.040]   captioning and subtitling and everything else in the next couple of years.
[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:28.480]   So, yeah, there's, there's just so many parts of this that, um, these, uh, WWDC can't
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:35.000]   know, so so useful because it's, as, as simple and simple minded as a statement as the sounds,
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.040]   there is nothing in that keynote that they did not choose to put there.
[00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:43.480]   So it's super significant when they choose to spend so much time speaking in detail about
[00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:47.520]   accessibility features and people who have, uh, how they're going to make their technology
[00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:52.720]   accessible to people who have problems with vision and people who have problems with,
[00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:57.400]   uh, with fine motor control, uh, and people who have problems with, uh, with, with color
[00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:58.400]   perception.
[00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:03.440]   Uh, and it's, uh, not only are they, uh, talking about it because they feel as though
[00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:07.440]   this is as important as almost anything else that they're announcing that day, uh, I think
[00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:12.680]   that they, I, I wouldn't be surprised if they also acknowledge that this is something that
[00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:18.680]   they can be a leader at, and one way of defining leadership is getting their first and having
[00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:23.120]   the best solution and killing all the competition, but in other aspect of the leader of being
[00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:26.800]   a leader is inspiring other people and putting their attention on something you feel that
[00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:27.920]   they should be paying attention to.
[00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:32.400]   Uh, and of course Apple's not the only company doing that, but I think that the, the, they're
[00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:35.960]   the company that's flying that flag, uh, as highly as they can.
[00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:40.280]   I mean, I brought my, my, my pick of the week, which I might be burning right now because
[00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:43.320]   I have to, because it's, it's, it's, it's something that's relevant.
[00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:50.240]   Uh, the new Kindle, uh, reader, uh, has a, an actual special, uh, special font selection,
[00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:52.120]   uh, for people who have dyslexia.
[00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:57.600]   So it basically, it's a, uh, to someone who does not have that, uh, that problem reading,
[00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:03.160]   it looks like a very, very weird or stylistic or hippie sort of font, but it actually, uh,
[00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:07.080]   the things that tend to confuse the brain that has a problem in actually discriminating
[00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:09.000]   letters and forming them into words.
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:13.600]   Uh, it basically gets rid of those hacks that kind of, uh, that putties in those cracks
[00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:18.400]   in the sidewalk that it is like, so brain will trip over and makes it easier to create.
[00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:22.240]   And when you think about software, it costs a lot of money to develop, but it's not as
[00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:29.280]   though you have to buy, buy up all the mission, all the manufacturing capability of the world
[00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:32.840]   to fuse glass to this new kind of metal that you've created.
[00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:35.680]   Uh, it costs money to develop, but in the end, it's just electrons.
[00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:40.000]   It costs nothing in the long run to add an extra font that makes this easier to use for
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:41.120]   other people.
[00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:47.280]   Just like the, uh, the community that needs, again, interfaces that don't require quite
[00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:53.560]   such a precise touch or, uh, that, uh, that require a mono output or require real, uh,
[00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:57.400]   require a lot of help for people with low vision.
[00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:58.800]   That's not a huge market.
[00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:00.960]   It's also not something they're going to get a lot of grant money for.
[00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:03.320]   It's not something they're going to get a big advertising hit for.
[00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:06.880]   It's not going to be a telephone in which Tim Cook and a big fluffy tuxedo was singing
[00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:11.240]   to a person with a bad low vision and trying to get sympathy for the company.
[00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:14.120]   It's just something that they feel is an important thing.
[00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:18.760]   And although you, of course you, uh, my, one of my broken record things about Apple
[00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:23.600]   is that I wish that they would make, uh, make devices that are more accessible to people
[00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:27.800]   who don't necessarily, uh, have the money to buy a luxury item, but that doesn't mean
[00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:33.160]   that they're not focused on trying to make it so that there's a few barriers as possible
[00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:37.200]   while they can still be Apple and still, uh, can pursue their business points.
[00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:38.200]   So probably to them.
[00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:41.840]   Uh, hope you're enjoying this memory trip down memory lane.
[00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:47.200]   As we get ready for a great year for Mac break leave, for a 2017 with Renee and Andy and
[00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:51.880]   and serenity and all, you know, Georgia, all the people who joins us, join us every,
[00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:53.840]   uh, every week.
[00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:57.800]   Mac break week leaves on Tuesday's 11 AM Pacific, 2 PM Eastern.
[00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:00.960]   Uh, that would be 1900 UTC.
[00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:02.520]   I hope you will stop by.
[00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:06.240]   This coming Tuesday brand new show for you, but because I wanted to give everybody off
[00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:09.760]   the, uh, the week off for the holidays, uh, we thought we'd put together some of the
[00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:10.760]   best moments.
[00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:17.000]   Now, we, you got to remember that we didn't learn about the details of the iPhone seven
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.320]   until September of this year.
[00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:23.080]   So way back in June, we were all debating.
[00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:28.960]   And I think the big question at that time, if you remember was would they could they might
[00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:32.560]   they remove the headphone jack?
[00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:37.920]   Now, and I acknowledge it's a rumor, but the rumor is Apple will take the headphone jack
[00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:40.880]   out of the iPhone, the next iPhone.
[00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:41.880]   What?
[00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:42.880]   Leo, what?
[00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:43.880]   Uh, okay.
[00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:47.520]   This rumor has been around for a while, but as we get closer and closer, as we get closer
[00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:49.640]   and closer, I think it gets more and more credible.
[00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:54.320]   And also to add to the credibility, Motorola just did that with their Moto Z.
[00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:55.880]   There's no headphone jack.
[00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:58.320]   I had a bunch of HTC phones that didn't have headset jack.
[00:41:58.320 --> 00:41:59.320]   Really?
[00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:00.320]   What?
[00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:02.400]   They had, they had this little dongle you put on the bottom of the USB.
[00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:05.360]   I think there were windows, mobile phones, but there might have been a couple others.
[00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:06.360]   And you'd put this little USB dongle.
[00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:11.000]   It was a breakout and it would go to, uh, like a headphone jack and then a charger and
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   other stuff.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:17.080]   Neelai Patel writing in the Verge, taking the headphone jack off phones is user hostile
[00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:18.080]   and stupid.
[00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:20.480]   Have some dignity, he says.
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:26.360]   Uh, John Gruber responds during fireball.net saying, Hey, that's what people said when
[00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:30.720]   Apple took the floppy disk out of the iMac, this is times are changing.
[00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:34.400]   When I think of one of the things every year that takes out the headphone jack, like just
[00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:36.440]   for the last, do you think they won't do it?
[00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:38.280]   No, I mean, at some point they'll do it.
[00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:39.280]   They'll do it.
[00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:43.720]   Apple tends to make changes and they believe that they can provide a better sort of a technological
[00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:44.720]   leap forward.
[00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:47.200]   So it's why they, the dock port was a, was a horrible port.
[00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:50.800]   They had rewired it, you know, for fire wire and for video and for audio and it, it had
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:51.800]   just become unbearable.
[00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:55.160]   So they switched to lightning and people complained and now we use lightning.
[00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:59.040]   I mean, the biggest problem with the switch was that Apple utterly failed to have adapters
[00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:02.320]   ready for weeks afterwards, which was just incredibly bad.
[00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:04.280]   But the, the change itself ended up moving us forward.
[00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:07.560]   And for the last few years, they've, they've been prototyping things without headphone
[00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:11.120]   jacks because when you remove the headphone jacks, the internal volume and there's other
[00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:12.760]   things that you can do with it.
[00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:16.120]   And one year, maybe this year they'll ship it and it, whichever year they ship it, we
[00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:18.160]   will be incredibly upset.
[00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:21.160]   And then three, four, five years from now, we'll probably barely remember there was a
[00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:22.160]   headphone jack.
[00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:26.080]   I mean, we were upset with the 30 pin to, to lightning, but does anyone ever want to
[00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:27.280]   go back to the 30 pin?
[00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:29.200]   I mean, I mean, I, I look at those.
[00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:33.200]   I, when I find them laying around my house at some point, I'm looking at like, oh man,
[00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:37.440]   that was, that was an really unhappy life, you know, compared to, you know, these small
[00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:38.440]   little connections.
[00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:43.720]   I think that the hard part for Apple is is that you could theoretically try to do it softly,
[00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:47.320]   which is that we're going to release all these great products that are now using lightning
[00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:51.760]   and, and, or, or Bluetooth, or, and, but the problem is, is can you build up enough
[00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:54.360]   demand to make it worth making lots of those?
[00:43:54.360 --> 00:44:00.080]   You know, if you do it, do it by taking the headset away, if you do it gradually, of course,
[00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:03.840]   in a year, we, you know, we all know that the heads that's going to go away, but our
[00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:06.040]   people are going to get enough sales out of it.
[00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:09.200]   So, so then the, if I take the headphone away, you kind of force everybody to go down that
[00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:12.400]   path and it could, you know, it could have a negative impact on the number of people
[00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:14.200]   that upgrade because they just don't want to go down that path.
[00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:18.880]   I think that's the big, you know, people like me that have invested a lot in head, in headphones,
[00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:23.520]   you know, might be a little more resistant to, to upgrading on this round, which could be,
[00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:25.520]   you know, billions of dollars for Apple.
[00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:31.240]   Yeah, I mean, I, I've, I've, I did write something and then decide not to post it because I don't
[00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:35.920]   want to respond to a, to a rumor, especially if it's something I'm going to, if I, if I
[00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:39.520]   feel the need to say something rather dramatic, I shouldn't, I shouldn't say things like that
[00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:42.120]   about things that may or may not actually happen.
[00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:47.480]   But I didn't read, I did not read, read, read, rumors piece.
[00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:51.320]   I disagree with the headline because I don't think it's, I don't think the two situations
[00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:54.160]   aren't anyway analogous.
[00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:57.880]   This rumor has been around for such a long time and it's been spiking in the past two
[00:44:57.880 --> 00:44:58.880]   or three months.
[00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:02.040]   And so for the past, at least for the past month, in addition to all the other things
[00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:05.880]   that I sort of spy on other people for when I'm in public, I've been sort of trying to
[00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:08.840]   add to that list what kind of headphones are they're using?
[00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:16.720]   And I rarely see people on buses, on trains, in public parks, all these other regular public
[00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:19.480]   places using Bluetooth headphones instead of wired ones.
[00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:24.080]   People tend to, the world that I, the world that I've been observing is one in which people
[00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:30.200]   tend to buy cheap $10 to $30 wired compact headphones and use that as their daily listening
[00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:31.440]   thing.
[00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:36.760]   So if Apple were to suddenly, if Apple were to suddenly say every single version, every
[00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:42.760]   single iOS running 2016 model iPhone is not going to have it on a headphone jack.
[00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:45.880]   You're going to have to either buy special headphones or you're going to have to buy
[00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:47.120]   carry a dongle.
[00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:50.200]   I think that that would be very, that would be quite premature at this point.
[00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:54.120]   It's not as though people are moving away from wired headphones so far.
[00:45:54.120 --> 00:46:00.920]   Bluetooth is simply a way of connecting audio to a phone that is useful for some applications
[00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:04.120]   but not at all attractive in most applications.
[00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:09.040]   I think it's like when they did just the new iMac, it wasn't just that they deleted the
[00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:10.560]   floppy port.
[00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:14.480]   Remember that they switched from USB, excuse me, from ADB to USB.
[00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:18.240]   That was a different sort of thing because all it required, everyone with everything was
[00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:23.000]   moving to USB anyway, all the future devices that anybody was going to buy for any platform,
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   if you wanted to buy a mouse or keyboard, it was going to be USB.
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:27.960]   That was very consumer positive.
[00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:33.160]   Also you switch out, it's not as though you go through lots of keyboards and mouses.
[00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:36.920]   You will probably use the one that comes with the device and if you don't like it, you will
[00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:38.960]   buy a replacement once and that's it.
[00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:40.440]   It's not like leaving the house.
[00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:41.440]   I don't have headphones.
[00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:42.440]   Thank goodness.
[00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:45.480]   I found another set of headphones in my glove box.
[00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:47.080]   I'll use those ones instead.
[00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:49.160]   I just think it's quite premature.
[00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:57.960]   If Apple were to introduce headphones, headphones, this fall, I've kind of stuck for an answer
[00:46:57.960 --> 00:47:01.800]   as to how they would present this as anything for a look.
[00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:06.360]   Now we have more volume inside the iPhone to work with and look, we have one less component
[00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:08.280]   that we have to pay for.
[00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:13.360]   No, they're going to say so that the sound is now going to be 20 times better because
[00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:16.520]   the DAC is outside of or something.
[00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:19.240]   The real reason is an issue.
[00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:21.120]   We can ignore it when HTC does it.
[00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:25.200]   You can ignore it when Moto Z does it because there's many, many choices but only one company
[00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:27.000]   makes an iPhone.
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:28.840]   So it changes it for everybody.
[00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:32.600]   I don't want to say that people should just ignore it because when you do see something
[00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:36.320]   in the Wall Street Journal, you should think this is the best time to express your concerns
[00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:40.160]   because if Apple, if you say wait, wait until Apple goes up on stage and makes their case,
[00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:41.400]   by then that iPhone is done.
[00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:42.400]   That's shipping.
[00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:45.560]   No matter what you say after that, that iPhone is already shipping and there have been cases
[00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:50.240]   where Apple backtrack like with the buttonless iPod shuffle and they went back to buttons.
[00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:52.280]   But that's you know, you had a year of a buttonless.
[00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:57.320]   The other thing that worries me is it buys three or four more years for the lightning
[00:47:57.320 --> 00:47:58.320]   port.
[00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:03.280]   And it works off any conceivable shift to Type-C connector because if you make this change,
[00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:05.720]   you're not going to, next year, get rid of the lightning port.
[00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:09.160]   I believe they feel the lightning port is way ahead of the Type-C connector still, that
[00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:12.440]   it's thinner, it's lighter, it does more things and they have a better control over it.
[00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:16.040]   I wouldn't guess that anybody thinks that but Apple.
[00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:18.360]   It's a smaller profile connector still for them.
[00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:20.360]   USB-C is a little bit bigger and they can't re-ify.
[00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:23.360]   It's a higher profit connector for them.
[00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:24.360]   That's true too.
[00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:27.280]   But so like you can make it like an Apple could go up on stage and say, look, we've done
[00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:31.320]   this but we've also built, the lightning now has these audio pins and it'll do the DAC
[00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:32.320]   inside.
[00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:33.320]   That's a little sad.
[00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:35.480]   They'll give you analog out and there's a little adapter and they'll probably sell
[00:48:35.480 --> 00:48:38.440]   it for 30 bucks but hopefully they'll put it in the box and you can go on using your
[00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:39.440]   headphones.
[00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:42.440]   We have lightning ear pods for you.
[00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:44.920]   But the biggest concern is people who want to charge while listening and that happens
[00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:45.920]   all the time.
[00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:49.040]   You know, you were talking about kids watching Minecraft, you know, while they sit there.
[00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:52.720]   There's all sorts of people but there are also all sorts of people who just listen without
[00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:53.720]   ear pods.
[00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:54.720]   I listen to podcasts all the time.
[00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:56.880]   I know and that's not going to be a good trend.
[00:48:56.880 --> 00:49:00.680]   I don't want to see more people walking down the street with their speakers open.
[00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:04.560]   Not in public but if they put to like right now the iPhone is Apple, the music company
[00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:08.280]   has paid pitiful attention to speakers on iPhones over the years.
[00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:11.800]   They finally got in the iPads better with the echo it with the big, you couldn't take
[00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:12.800]   chambers.
[00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:13.800]   You can't put good speakers on it.
[00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:17.360]   No but you could put two speakers maybe even more than two speakers and at least finally
[00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:20.520]   have something where if I turn it, you know, it's not coming out one side and if I put
[00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:23.840]   my hand ears not coming out at all, at least it's coming out of the top or maybe coming
[00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:25.200]   out of both sides finally.
[00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:27.120]   I mean there could be improvement there.
[00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:31.920]   Does it break things like credit card readers and stuff that are designed for the audio?
[00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:32.920]   Where will have a hard time?
[00:49:32.920 --> 00:49:34.600]   Yeah and some scientific equipment.
[00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:38.760]   There are a couple of other extended reasons.
[00:49:38.760 --> 00:49:43.360]   One of which is that remember that the headphone jack is a way for a developer to add hardware
[00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:46.560]   to the iPhone without having to be part of the MFI program.
[00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:52.560]   There's also maybe a concern that there will be it will be possible to do some form of
[00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:58.040]   DRM through that connector that you can't do through a perfectly analog headphone device.
[00:49:58.040 --> 00:50:02.960]   There's a question of will developers be well just makers of headphones be able to still
[00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:09.520]   make really cheap headphones without without having to pay be burdened by licensing fees.
[00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:10.520]   There are a lot of questions here.
[00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:12.040]   I really hope Apple doesn't do it.
[00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:13.720]   I don't think it's the right time for it.
[00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:18.400]   I think that it would it would make me rethink a couple of things about Apple if they did
[00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:19.400]   it.
[00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:23.680]   But this unfortunately this is the time of year remember that if there are if there's
[00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:29.600]   going to be a case designed for the iPhone that does not have a headphone jack we would
[00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:34.800]   have expected to have seen samples of this show up somewhere and we're starting to see
[00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:36.960]   purported samples show up.
[00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:41.360]   So who knows it'll be just the one with the better camera that'll have no headphone port
[00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:47.440]   there by guaranteeing maybe most possible rage from the.
[00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:51.520]   That's the planet of the apps.
[00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:56.320]   I'm kind of on the one hand what a great name on and Apple's going to produce this.
[00:50:56.320 --> 00:50:59.200]   But on the other hand I'm a little disappointed that they really are going with this straight
[00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:01.160]   ahead reality show format.
[00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:04.640]   I feel like they should that's not as innovative as it could be.
[00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:11.200]   Yeah, especially when you look at how reality shows are produced where they don't they really
[00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:15.560]   are shaped by producers or at least the understanding when you're watching them is that they didn't
[00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:20.280]   just simply pick like if this is a this is supposed to highlight the development of apps.
[00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:23.320]   They didn't pick like the five most promising apps.
[00:51:23.320 --> 00:51:29.360]   They decided they wanted to cast a role of here is the socially socially demented nerd.
[00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:32.720]   Here is the team that works good to well together.
[00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:37.160]   Here is the husband and wife who's who's probably got it whose marriage might come apart as
[00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:40.000]   they as nerves are are frazzled.
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:45.120]   Here's the 12 year old wonder wonder genius and you know that like if this world America
[00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:50.280]   has got talent you're like it doesn't matter who they show in the next 11 weeks.
[00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:54.480]   You know that they pick the adorable 12 year old girl who cries every time a judge says
[00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:56.520]   something nice about her singing.
[00:51:56.520 --> 00:51:58.800]   They know they pick her to win.
[00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:00.520]   We like we love reality shows.
[00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:01.840]   I mean the ratings are great.
[00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:08.360]   People love American Idol in the voice and survivor and on and on and on naked dating or
[00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:09.760]   whatever it's called.
[00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:14.240]   But by the way they may be naked but you don't get to see it.
[00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:15.240]   I don't understand.
[00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:16.240]   What's the point?
[00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:17.240]   Okay.
[00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:18.240]   Okay.
[00:52:18.240 --> 00:52:19.240]   The point is scabs.
[00:52:19.240 --> 00:52:25.160]   You get to see scabs and all kinds of places except for just two or three.
[00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:28.680]   So I guess this is going to be kind of like I don't know shark tank or project green light
[00:52:28.680 --> 00:52:34.960]   where you've got 10 app developers and they try to convince the you know big shots that
[00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:37.920]   they're got the next big app and then blah blah blah.
[00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:44.200]   Applicants must agree to have their app functional on iOS, Mac OS, TV OS or watch OS by late October.
[00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:50.120]   If they're accepted onto the show developers will receive guidance from tech experts potential
[00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:51.120]   fund.
[00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:54.920]   I think they need to be in front of all of us.
[00:52:54.920 --> 00:53:01.640]   Potential funding from VCs of up to 10 million dollars in promotion in Apple's iOS store.
[00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:06.320]   So they're going to there's an open casting call.
[00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:10.320]   It will be filming later this year.
[00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:13.040]   Daniel are you going to are you going to try out?
[00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:14.920]   I wanted to be the Tim Gunn of the show.
[00:53:14.920 --> 00:53:16.680]   I thought that would be more appropriate.
[00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:18.720]   We want to be judges.
[00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:23.000]   I have nothing against reality shows but I just feel like it's as you say, Andy, it's
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:28.800]   going to be archetypes but it's also inevitably going to be misrepresenting the real process.
[00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:30.360]   Oh, of course.
[00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:31.360]   Yeah.
[00:53:31.360 --> 00:53:34.880]   Especially because I mean, what have we been talking about for this whole first segment
[00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:39.440]   of the show frustrations with the app store with you know, we haven't gotten into frustrations
[00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:41.360]   with submissions and app rejections.
[00:53:41.360 --> 00:53:42.360]   Yeah.
[00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:47.560]   And it just finds what it means to be a developer on Apple platforms in many ways these days.
[00:53:47.560 --> 00:53:53.080]   And even even apart from that, like if Apple's paying for the show, you're not you're not
[00:53:53.080 --> 00:54:00.120]   either going to even have things like frustrations with like the inscrutability of an API.
[00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:02.680]   Oh, you'll never hear about that.
[00:54:02.680 --> 00:54:09.000]   So all the kind of stuff that might make for natural drama in an in a show that's like
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:14.080]   about something that's kind of hard to jazz up, I think, you know, software development.
[00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:17.800]   But the natural drama, yeah, the natural model will be a lot of time.
[00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:18.800]   Will be a lot of time.
[00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:22.280]   Feeling with problems that Apple doesn't really want to put the spot light on.
[00:54:22.280 --> 00:54:27.320]   So no, and that's my concern is this really just going to be a great big ad for Apple
[00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:30.400]   and how great it is and oh my God, you've won the jackpot.
[00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:32.720]   You're going to be the next what's happened.
[00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:37.600]   And that's really, I think, not the message that should be that the kids especially who
[00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:39.800]   are thinking of this is a career should be.
[00:54:39.800 --> 00:54:46.240]   Yeah, I had an idea for Apple's maybe, you know, why would Apple choose to do this show
[00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:47.680]   of all shows?
[00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:54.280]   And Apple is sort of like so many tech companies just famously troubled by recruiting, right?
[00:54:54.280 --> 00:54:55.920]   Trying to find employees.
[00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:58.000]   This is how you find talent.
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:04.760]   They're going to have a roster of ambitious, you know, probably not all of them talented,
[00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:09.880]   but they're going to have a pretty good dossier here of people who are willing to really,
[00:55:09.880 --> 00:55:14.320]   I guess, fight for being a developer, fight for building great apps.
[00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:17.160]   And then Apple being the one in charge of all this, I guess, they can just come swoop
[00:55:17.160 --> 00:55:20.520]   in and say, hey, regardless of whether you've got on the show or whether you won the show,
[00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:23.080]   how'd you like to come interview for this decision?
[00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:25.840]   Oh, you that's a really good point, Daniel.
[00:55:25.840 --> 00:55:26.840]   That may be the real reward.
[00:55:26.840 --> 00:55:30.280]   I mean, yeah, I mean, yeah, forget that.
[00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:31.280]   I don't know.
[00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:34.520]   I mean, how much trouble are they having attracting talent as it is?
[00:55:34.520 --> 00:55:37.320]   Daniel, by the way, we didn't mention this, but you were an Apple.
[00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:38.320]   You worked at Apple.
[00:55:38.320 --> 00:55:39.560]   You were a developer at Apple.
[00:55:39.560 --> 00:55:43.520]   I was, yeah, starting in 1995 through 2002.
[00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:49.320]   So I've been out of Apple for much longer than I ever worked there, but I do have some
[00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:50.760]   experience with the company.
[00:55:50.760 --> 00:55:53.680]   And of course, it's fueled my interest over the last.
[00:55:53.680 --> 00:55:54.680]   Yeah.
[00:55:54.680 --> 00:55:55.680]   And you were there at the reverse.
[00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:56.680]   What did you work on?
[00:55:56.680 --> 00:56:00.080]   I worked on System 7, System 8.
[00:56:00.080 --> 00:56:06.280]   And then I jumped ship from the System 7 team and went to work on very early OS 10 stuff.
[00:56:06.280 --> 00:56:10.040]   And the stuff I was working on was always really low level stuff, usually stuff with
[00:56:10.040 --> 00:56:13.600]   no graphics interface, you know, so stuff on System 7.
[00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:16.840]   I worked on stuff like the process manager.
[00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:22.520]   And then I switched over to OS 10 and worked on stuff like the code fragment manager, which
[00:56:22.520 --> 00:56:28.440]   was the thing that loads the code literally from disk to make an app run.
[00:56:28.440 --> 00:56:31.920]   So it was real low level, you know, real nerdy stuff.
[00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:34.680]   But yeah, it was an experience.
[00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:37.640]   To be there at that time, I was hired.
[00:56:37.640 --> 00:56:44.080]   I was actually hired as a full-time employee in 1996, a few months before Steve Jobs came
[00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:45.080]   back.
[00:56:45.080 --> 00:56:48.960]   So there was really quite a time to be there.
[00:56:48.960 --> 00:56:53.880]   And you know, people talk about it a lot these days, but that was the time when, wow, the
[00:56:53.880 --> 00:57:00.200]   folks who were at Apple then and stuck around, that was like a time to really believe in
[00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:06.800]   the company because everybody was leaving to go to companies that conventional wisdom
[00:57:06.800 --> 00:57:08.680]   would say had a shot in the world.
[00:57:08.680 --> 00:57:13.240]   And Apple was at the bottom of that list for almost everybody, including many people, you
[00:57:13.240 --> 00:57:18.400]   know, many of us who were in the company, I think still thought it was a long shot, but
[00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:20.920]   we were just couldn't find anything better to work on.
[00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:26.760]   So I was excited to be there and I'm really proud of Apple for making it as far back as
[00:57:26.760 --> 00:57:27.760]   they have.
[00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:33.600]   And now that I own a complaint is they're so powerful that, you know, I certainly have
[00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:37.240]   no ability to reign in that power.
[00:57:37.240 --> 00:57:41.880]   So see how far they go, I guess.
[00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:44.240]   Andy and I go your pick of the week.
[00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:49.840]   I wish you'd called on me instead of Ray, because I almost had this time perfectly.
[00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:54.960]   There is a kitchen item that I've been like sort of dreaming of owning since I was eight
[00:57:54.960 --> 00:57:59.040]   years old and my parents didn't have one, but I saw the commercials for them.
[00:57:59.040 --> 00:58:03.360]   And then stupidly, I only recently I realized that these things were still available.
[00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:06.720]   So I can, I can't show it to you in operation, but I can show it to you.
[00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:13.280]   There is the magic, the magical results of the West Ben stir crazy popcorn maker.
[00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:15.400]   Oh, they're popping right now.
[00:58:15.400 --> 00:58:16.400]   It's happening.
[00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:17.400]   It's finished popping.
[00:58:17.400 --> 00:58:21.120]   But it's amazing because like it's this like walk.
[00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:24.360]   Let me adjust crayon cam 3000, the future video podcasting.
[00:58:24.360 --> 00:58:26.240]   So you get a better look at it.
[00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:32.000]   It is essentially just like a walk sort of thing you pour like a couple of tablespoons
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:37.640]   of oil into and then like a cup, a cup of cup of popcorn kernels into.
[00:58:37.640 --> 00:58:43.320]   And it's like it's it's it maximizes every variable of popcorn.
[00:58:43.320 --> 00:58:48.240]   Now, first of all, you get the jiffy pop aspect in which you just see these like there, it's
[00:58:48.240 --> 00:58:53.000]   they're like a little a couple of motor motorized arms that just keep the the kernel spinning
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:54.000]   through the oil.
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:56.680]   So it doesn't burn and every kernel pops.
[00:58:56.680 --> 00:59:02.760]   So you basically get to watch popcorn appearing as the by magic in front of your eyes.
[00:59:02.760 --> 00:59:10.320]   And then you also get the advantage of stovetop popping by which it's like light, it's fluffy,
[00:59:10.320 --> 00:59:14.580]   it's hot, it's crunchy, and it makes the room smell like popcorn.
[00:59:14.580 --> 00:59:20.000]   And also you get the laziness of microwave popcorn where when you're done when it's
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:27.120]   finished, you just tip it over like this and then take the scorching hot electric walk
[00:59:27.120 --> 00:59:28.120]   sort of thing.
[00:59:28.120 --> 00:59:32.080]   If you're not demonstrating it, you can you will not get the towel trapped underneath
[00:59:32.080 --> 00:59:33.080]   it like that.
[00:59:33.080 --> 00:59:34.080]   There you go.
[00:59:34.080 --> 00:59:36.920]   Because it is actually popping into its own bowl of popcorn.
[00:59:36.920 --> 00:59:39.240]   It's not that hot, but I just don't want to.
[00:59:39.240 --> 00:59:42.120]   I don't want to make a YouTube viral sensation.
[00:59:42.120 --> 00:59:44.840]   It's scorching myself.
[00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:46.280]   There you go.
[00:59:46.280 --> 00:59:47.280]   And there you go.
[00:59:47.280 --> 00:59:48.280]   Look at that.
[00:59:48.280 --> 00:59:50.720]   Ladies and gentlemen, it's like this is the best pop.
[00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:54.200]   It's like Alton Brown has Alton Brown hates unit taskers.
[00:59:54.200 --> 00:59:59.120]   Alton Brown has said that he, you know, I just put a I just put like a big steel ball
[00:59:59.120 --> 01:00:03.640]   on the top of the stove and I cover it with aluminum foil and now you have a bowl, a
[01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:04.640]   steel bowl.
[01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:10.320]   I aluminum foil, you have to clean up, you just wind up here with just a an actual bowl
[01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:15.680]   of popcorn that you take with you into the living room or just keep this on the on an
[01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:20.560]   end table and keep making more popcorn as you go from the the the the Lord of the Rings
[01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:23.760]   trilogy to the Hobbit, Tobit trilogy.
[01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:27.800]   And again, it's just beautiful, crunchy hot.
[01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:35.160]   If only if only you could smell how nice my office smells right now.
[01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:38.160]   Delicious hot fresh popcorn.
[01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:39.880]   And it's like 30 bucks.
[01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:42.840]   And I've sort of thought to myself like why I have $30.
[01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:45.680]   I'm going to make another $30 really quickly.
[01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:48.240]   Why don't I buy myself live the dream.
[01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:51.360]   I myself a stir crazy corn popper.
[01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:52.360]   So here it is empty.
[01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:55.920]   So you can see like the spinning like rotating arms there.
[01:00:55.920 --> 01:01:00.360]   And as you can see, like every kernel is like has been popped and it's a very clean pan.
[01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:05.560]   When you're done, you can just like sort of unscrew these motorized arms.
[01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:08.320]   Just give it a wipe out to make just to take the grease out of it.
[01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:09.640]   There's like no cleanup whatsoever.
[01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:13.480]   You can toss the the bowl part in the dishwasher.
[01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:18.720]   So and so it's my pick of the week because it's inexpensive.
[01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:19.720]   It's awesome.
[01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:20.840]   It's entertaining on several levels.
[01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:25.080]   And that means that as we say goodbye, now I have a bowl of popcorn I can eat as I go
[01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:27.680]   back upstairs to my one room with air conditioning.
[01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:31.680]   And the an echo.
[01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:32.680]   And the an echo.
[01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:33.920]   He's a man.
[01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:34.920]   I'm sorry.
[01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:36.280]   There is no phone app for this.
[01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:37.280]   Okay.
[01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:39.800]   That does not disqualify it from being a useful kitchen item.
[01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:41.520]   I you make me want popcorn.
[01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:45.000]   If that's was if that was your goal, there you go.
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.920]   And if you don't if you if you can't have salt, you don't have to put salt on it.
[01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:50.400]   If you can't have sweet things, you don't have to.
[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:51.400]   Okay.
[01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:57.320]   I asked my my internet doctor, Dr. Mom in the chat room, she says popcorn's okay because
[01:01:57.320 --> 01:01:59.520]   it's got a low glycemic load.
[01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:01.160]   So there you go.
[01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:02.720]   More popcorn for everyone.
[01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:06.080]   But I don't I don't keep chips and like tortillas chips and stuff like that in the
[01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:07.080]   house.
[01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:08.080]   Yeah, there you go.
[01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:09.080]   Have it with your delves lemonade.
[01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:13.200]   This stuff is pure sugar, but it has no trans fats.
[01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:15.080]   It's gluten free ladies gentlemen.
[01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:18.600]   So I'm going to free free free.
[01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:19.600]   Yeah.
[01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:20.600]   Yeah.
[01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:26.080]   It depends on what you use as your your oil, whether it has trans fats or not.
[01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:31.400]   So did you do a lot of research before you settled on the West Bend popcorn maker?
[01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:36.120]   Well, I remember as a kid, the commercials for the West Bend stir cream maker.
[01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:37.120]   Yeah.
[01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:42.240]   I wanted to honor the achievement of the original intellectual property and patent holder.
[01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:48.040]   Just like people get offended by Samsung, you know, ripping off Apple.
[01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:51.800]   Yeah, I mean, I actually I actually had a the stove.
[01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:56.000]   The stove in this house is like a glass top and you can't really shake a pan in front
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.560]   of it and also create some mess.
[01:02:57.560 --> 01:03:01.800]   I have a hot air popper, but it makes this like chewy sort of like hot air pop.
[01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:02.800]   Right.
[01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:03.800]   Yeah.
[01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:06.200]   But this is like this is exactly like no, no, no, no kid.
[01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:07.360]   I got this like three weeks ago.
[01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:11.920]   This is probably my fifth or sixth bowl of popcorn every time every time I make this.
[01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:18.000]   I want to I think I'm about to like dump this into a roast brother's brown shopping bag.
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:23.040]   Shake it with salt and then get into the car so my mom can drive me and my siblings to
[01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:25.640]   a movie theater to watch a cartoon.
[01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:30.360]   Now did you get now there's I'm looking because I'm of course in the market now for this fine
[01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:34.200]   product popcorn asking for a friend coffee.
[01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:35.200]   You could poutine it.
[01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:36.880]   Ooh, ooh, don't start me.
[01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:38.520]   Don't have me on a corn.
[01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:40.720]   You can you can pop coin ball it.
[01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:41.720]   You can ball it.
[01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:42.720]   Mix it with mix it with sugar.
[01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:43.720]   Make it make a pop.
[01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:44.720]   Make a pop.
[01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:45.720]   Wow.
[01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:46.720]   There's another Rhode Island treat.
[01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:48.960]   I haven't had a wild popcorn balls.
[01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:54.440]   Let's all go to the shore and get some clam cakes and and we'll fight surrounding the
[01:03:54.440 --> 01:03:55.440]   party.
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:56.440]   Yeah.
[01:03:56.440 --> 01:03:58.440]   Hey, go go the roller derby.
[01:03:58.440 --> 01:03:59.440]   Have a real.
[01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:03.640]   Did you get the dome one or did you get the bowl one?
[01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:06.400]   Oh, you want the oh no, no, no, no, you don't have the flat sides.
[01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:07.440]   You want the bowl one.
[01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:08.440]   You want the bowl one.
[01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:09.440]   Okay.
[01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:12.240]   You for entertaining this is this is the sign of class.
[01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:18.080]   No, that's not the note with a straight size.
[01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:21.960]   They don't you weren't sweating over a hot stove, but with the bowl dome, that's going
[01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:24.080]   to be our little secret.
[01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:26.000]   They can't tell.
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:31.160]   I kind of want to get one for like the, you know, for the garage.
[01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:33.000]   I want to get one for the boat for the car.
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.880]   Actually, a boat and get it now.
[01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:35.880]   Now get a car.
[01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:36.880]   Very important.
[01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:39.680]   What kind of popcorn do you recommend?
[01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:45.280]   Well, probably because I was flashing back to the days of let's make a deal and re syndicated
[01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:51.000]   repeat when I was a kid and listening after this thing, a supply of jelly time.
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.440]   Remember them.
[01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:58.520]   And I got to say that those people at ABC were very, very knowledgeable because it is light
[01:04:58.520 --> 01:04:59.520]   and is yellow.
[01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:00.520]   It is fluffy.
[01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:01.520]   Yeah.
[01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:08.000]   And it doesn't make the it doesn't make the entire house smell like a 1973 Chevy Vega
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:12.480]   exploded and threw up inside your house as microwave popcorn is want to do.
[01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:17.440]   By the way, in case you're worried and here's the good news, the West Ben stir crazy popcorn
[01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:21.160]   popper is built to North American electrical standards.
[01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:27.120]   You, you, you, I still crave popcorn every time I see that.
[01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:30.360]   And by the way, I bought that thing.
[01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:32.280]   Actually, it became broken.
[01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:34.600]   So I had to buy another.
[01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:36.720]   We used it once.
[01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:37.720]   We never used it again.
[01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:38.960]   I like the old fashioned method.
[01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:43.320]   I do have a set of many ways that just have many ways of making coffee at home.
[01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:46.360]   I have many ways of making popcorn, two of my favorite treats.
[01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:49.520]   And we got a thing that has a handle to you cranking.
[01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:50.720]   It's twirls around.
[01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:54.520]   It's called a think a whirly gig popcorn maker.
[01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:58.360]   But really my favorite is still the pan.
[01:05:58.360 --> 01:05:59.360]   It's oil.
[01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:04.360]   Just, you know, simple.
[01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:05.360]   Andy's funny.
[01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:07.640]   You never know what you're getting at with Andy and not go.
[01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:14.120]   All right, we jumped now to August before the new iPhone came out and a big, big landmark
[01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:16.160]   for Apple Watch.
[01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:25.520]   How many, how many products in tech have sold one billion items took the computer industry
[01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:29.960]   25 years to ship the billionth PC.
[01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:34.400]   Android has passed a billion devices, but not just one manufacturer.
[01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:38.000]   It's one manufacturer part that's impressive.
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:39.000]   Yeah.
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000]   Yeah, really impressive.
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:42.000]   Diode's.
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:43.000]   Diode's.
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.000]   Diode's.
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.880]   You know what's cool?
[01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:48.480]   A billion iPhones.
[01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:49.760]   And I think it's kind of cool.
[01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:54.920]   Also, Steven Sinofsky, the guy behind Windows 8, former Microsoft employee, tweeted, getting
[01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:56.280]   to 1 billion cumulative.
[01:06:56.280 --> 01:07:02.080]   The iPhone 9.1 years, the PC 20 years, Android 4.5 years, McDonald's took 23 years to get
[01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:07.080]   to a billion hamburgers, Facebook to 8.7 years to get to a billion users.
[01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:11.120]   Well, and also, I think the Facebook and McDonald's are an equal thing, but when you
[01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:15.280]   have the personal computer, these are different manufacturers with different backgrounds and
[01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:16.280]   so on and so forth.
[01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:18.960]   So, you know, the iPhone is, I think, very different than the PC.
[01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:20.480]   And it costs a lot more than a big mess.
[01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:23.400]   And if you combine iPhone and Android, it's 2 billion really fast.
[01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:24.400]   Yeah.
[01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:25.400]   Isn't that amazing?
[01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:28.000]   I mean, the world has changed because of portable pocket computers.
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.000]   Yeah.
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:30.000]   Everybody has to.
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:34.040]   If you look at computers versus handsets, handsets are just obliterating everything.
[01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:35.040]   Yeah.
[01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:37.920]   Well, and you really think about the timing of things, you know, whether things were
[01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:38.920]   really ready to happen.
[01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:42.520]   I mean, obviously, the Newton was out there and it could have done the same thing over
[01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:44.800]   time, but just the technology wasn't there.
[01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:51.000]   The infrastructure or the ecosystem wasn't ready for that kind of screen at that time.
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:54.200]   So it really also is timing is everything.
[01:07:54.200 --> 01:08:01.000]   If you, and you can tell this is true because it's from Wolfram Alpha, stacked all the iPhones
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:02.000]   flat.
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:05.760]   You can take you to the moon.
[01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:06.760]   It would take you.
[01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:07.760]   You did this personally.
[01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:08.760]   You can believe it.
[01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:09.760]   Did he really?
[01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:10.760]   Did Steven do this?
[01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:11.920]   No, I don't know.
[01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:16.600]   It's so enough iPhones if stacked flat, they would go from the Earth to the ISS nine times.
[01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:17.760]   I don't know why they picked the ISS.
[01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:22.280]   The question is when they say nine times, are they calculating the different width of
[01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:23.280]   each iPhone?
[01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:25.280]   They're averaging seven and a half millimeters.
[01:08:25.280 --> 01:08:26.280]   Okay.
[01:08:26.280 --> 01:08:27.280]   Times a billion.
[01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:28.280]   But they're in sales amounts.
[01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:32.600]   So it would be, you know, I think that the accuracy is a...
[01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:34.600]   It's fudgey math.
[01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:39.720]   I guess I could turn it into the moon by just changing this calculation here.
[01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:42.720]   Wouldn't be so hard.
[01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:44.240]   It doesn't go probably to the moon.
[01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:45.240]   That's why.
[01:08:45.240 --> 01:08:47.080]   Maybe you can get it not even close.
[01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:50.520]   And besides, if you had a stack of iPhones going to the moon, what would keep them from
[01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:53.120]   falling over?
[01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:54.120]   You and your founders.
[01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:55.120]   You and your physics report.
[01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:56.120]   Well, you do.
[01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:57.120]   You do.
[01:08:57.120 --> 01:08:58.120]   You do.
[01:08:58.120 --> 01:08:59.120]   Perfectly.
[01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:00.120]   Yeah.
[01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:04.360]   Tim Cook says running Apple is sort of a lonely job.
[01:09:04.360 --> 01:09:07.120]   God, I feel bad now.
[01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:10.400]   Sort of a lonely job with extreme compensations.
[01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:14.400]   Well, he does say no one should feel sorry for a CEO.
[01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:15.400]   Yeah.
[01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:16.920]   And it's lonely at the top.
[01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:19.040]   They always say that.
[01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:20.040]   This is a...
[01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:22.120]   He's been given interviews lately.
[01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:26.320]   This is an interview with The Washington Post that came out this week.
[01:09:26.320 --> 01:09:28.120]   I'll be honest.
[01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:29.920]   I just couldn't get through it.
[01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:34.280]   So if you guys, first of all, like a lot of these interviews, like last week's interview,
[01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:37.360]   we talked about a lot of pros.
[01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:40.440]   Well, this one is really substantive.
[01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:43.280]   The one we were talking about last week, it was most...
[01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:47.640]   The one we were talking about last week gave you the impression that someone was able
[01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:52.080]   to sneak in 10 minutes and they had us really stretched that out and something like that.
[01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:53.080]   Right.
[01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:54.080]   Like a feature.
[01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:58.360]   This really looked like it was not only substantive, but also like the writer had the ability
[01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:02.000]   to come back later and ask him to elaborate or on some points.
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:06.840]   It really was one of the most introspective interviews with Tim Cook, I've seen.
[01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:11.060]   This is one of those interviews that not only for substance and length, but also for how
[01:10:11.060 --> 01:10:12.800]   well it was put together.
[01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:17.360]   It was, I clicked the little K in my chrome bar to make sure I get it.
[01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:21.120]   I save a copy to my Kindle because it's very, very readable.
[01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:26.760]   Cook 55 chooses his words carefully, taking long pauses and speaking with a slight Alabama
[01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:27.760]   draw.
[01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:31.440]   Though he has favorite phrases, many things are deep and Apple's mission is always his
[01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:32.440]   North Star.
[01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:34.840]   He eschews the jargon many CEOs use.
[01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:38.720]   And while he's quick to trumpet Apple, he's also unassuming, quickly noting after saying
[01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:42.400]   his job could be lonely that I'm not looking for any sympathy.
[01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:46.840]   CEOs don't need any sympathy.
[01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:48.840]   Well give us, let's walk through it then.
[01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:49.840]   Let's get the high points.
[01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:54.600]   He does admit that he hired the wrong person initially for Apple retail.
[01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:56.840]   This was after Ron Johnson left, right?
[01:10:56.840 --> 01:11:00.320]   Yeah, and it sounds like what we had all assumed.
[01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:01.320]   We knew that.
[01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:05.480]   It was a very cool culture clash between...
[01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:09.320]   We've all forgotten his name.
[01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:10.320]   Before Angela Arran's.
[01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:11.320]   The guy from Dixon's.
[01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:19.120]   If you've ever been to Dixon's in London, you would never assume that that would connect
[01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:20.120]   with Apple.
[01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:21.120]   Right.
[01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:26.360]   So I have bought things there and it's not the same as an Apple store.
[01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:31.640]   He says the North Star has always been the same, even as under Steve, which for us is
[01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:35.280]   about making insanely great products that really change the world in some way and rich
[01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:36.680]   people's lives.
[01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:38.120]   Our reason for being hasn't changed.
[01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:39.920]   I love hearing him say that.
[01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:45.280]   I'm not sure I'd agree that that's what they've been doing in the last few years, but that
[01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:48.560]   should be their goal.
[01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:53.800]   It's something that's very, very good for a CEO to be heard saying in depth review,
[01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:54.840]   in depth, like this.
[01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:58.160]   But with Apple and particularly the Tim Cook, you definitely believe it, or at least I certainly
[01:11:58.160 --> 01:11:59.160]   believe it.
[01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:00.680]   Oh, I think he's dead honest.
[01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:02.840]   That's one thing you've got to give Tim Cook.
[01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:05.080]   And also it syncs up very well.
[01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:06.080]   It's saying exactly.
[01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:09.640]   It syncs up very well with what he's saying throughout most of the rest of the interview
[01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:16.000]   is that it seems as though a lot of the hits that he and Apple tend to take are based on
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:20.120]   people not understanding that Apple is really in whatever they do.
[01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:21.800]   They're in it for the long haul.
[01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:26.800]   So if they don't come out with something, he talked about the Princess of PDAs, that
[01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:32.800]   was not just netbooks, but PDAs and all these categories that were not just simply flashing
[01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:36.360]   the pants, they were actually really, really good products that helped a lot of people
[01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:38.960]   that got that were very, very useful.
[01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:45.640]   But nonetheless, whatever articulation of an idea, the a PDA or the netbook was, it wasn't
[01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:49.520]   the sort of thing where 10 years later, people are still going to be using that sort of stuff.
[01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:53.440]   Whereas Apple is going to hold back their characters that they're going to hold back
[01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:57.080]   until they find the thing that people are going to be still using in 10 years.
[01:12:57.080 --> 01:12:59.480]   And sometimes that could be frustrating for analysts.
[01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:00.800]   It could be frustrating for users.
[01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:05.640]   It could be frustrating for shareholders if they really want to see that interim product
[01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:09.720]   that once again, very useful, very, very practical, but not the sort of thing that Apple wants
[01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:13.880]   to dedicate the next five or 10 years on.
[01:13:13.880 --> 01:13:16.320]   There's a lot of real meat here.
[01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:21.480]   And a lot of it goes back to some things that we knew about Apple all along, but we've never
[01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:25.200]   seen it articulated by one person quite so well.
[01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:32.360]   I really liked when he starts talking about Steve and the job of being his successor.
[01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:39.800]   I don't think that one of the things that frustrates me often about Apple executive
[01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:45.120]   interviews is that they're often very, very guarded about how they're feeling about anything
[01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:50.880]   and that you don't really get too much of a sense of here's the mission that I'm trying
[01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:53.000]   to complete by giving you this interview.
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:57.840]   As opposed to I'm here to give you an actual interview, I've actually highlighted this
[01:13:57.840 --> 01:13:58.840]   part of it.
[01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:01.720]   You succeeded one of the icons of American business.
[01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:05.920]   What does it feel like to step into those shoes, which we've heard articulated a million
[01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:10.920]   different ways, but he says his responses to me, Steve's not replaceable by anyone.
[01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:13.880]   And then in parentheses, noting that his voice softens here.
[01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:15.160]   He was an original of a species.
[01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:16.720]   I never viewed that as my role.
[01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:19.360]   I think it would have been a treacherous thing if I would have tried to do it.
[01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:23.520]   When I first took the job as CEO, I actually thought that Steve would be here for a long
[01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:27.760]   time because he was going to be chairman, work a bit less after he came back up the health
[01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:28.760]   curve.
[01:14:28.760 --> 01:14:32.440]   So I went into it with one thought and then weeks later, six weeks later, whatever, it
[01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:33.440]   was very quickly.
[01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:35.240]   The day he died was sort of the worst day ever.
[01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:39.800]   I had really convinced myself, I know this sounds probably bizarre at this point, but
[01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:43.200]   I convinced myself that he would bounce because he always did.
[01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:46.720]   So in some ways, Tim's the reluctant leader of Apple.
[01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:49.640]   I have huge respect for Tim Cook.
[01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:52.000]   And as I said, I get his integrity.
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:55.480]   He says one of the things that they've changed is they've brought a lot of social responsibility
[01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:59.040]   to Apple, which is something that was lacking under Steve Jobs.
[01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:04.600]   When asked, is the iPhone, the fact that the iPhone is now three quarters of your business
[01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:05.600]   is that a problem?
[01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:08.000]   He says, no, no, that's a privilege.
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:11.160]   He said, a smartphone is a one to one product.
[01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:18.040]   He says, no, a TV, there's one per household or a couple per household, but this is a privilege.
[01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:21.040]   What other products do you know where the ratio of people to the product for a consumer
[01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:23.600]   like products product will be one to one?
[01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:28.440]   And that means, he says a lot of people are focused on 90 days on the quarter, but that
[01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:34.120]   means in the long haul, the level of performance is going to skyrocket and there's nothing
[01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:38.760]   that's going to replace it in the short term or the intermediate term easily.
[01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:44.520]   And I think that also when you look at app installs and so on and so forth, the issue
[01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:50.240]   is that that revenue, while it may not keep on growing as end of year over year over year,
[01:15:50.240 --> 01:15:52.760]   is also not going to erode very quickly either.
[01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:56.560]   People are using the operating system, they're happy with, they bought a lot of apps for it.
[01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:58.840]   They're not going to go anywhere anytime soon.
[01:15:58.840 --> 01:16:02.680]   And making sure that that process is comfortable with these, you can move from one phone to
[01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:04.720]   the other all, so it makes it much easier.
[01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:10.840]   I mean, it's so seamless to go from one, from an old phone to a new phone that it really
[01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:11.840]   is in a process.
[01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:15.960]   But this is, but this is, the reason I bring this up is this is if I have a criticism of
[01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:21.720]   Tim and I realize who am I to criticize Tim, but if I have a criticism of Tim as an Apple
[01:16:21.720 --> 01:16:27.400]   user and Apple lover, it's that he's a great caretaker, he's a great operations guy, he's
[01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:32.120]   got a lot of integrity, he's a great, you know, he's a warm, wonderful person.
[01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:38.920]   But he doesn't have that spark that to take Apple to the next thing.
[01:16:38.920 --> 01:16:41.280]   I think Apple, and I don't know who it Apple does.
[01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:45.760]   I don't feel like Johnny Ives is really even very much present anymore.
[01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:50.000]   So I'm wondering where is that, that brilliance going to come from that takes Apple to the
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:51.000]   next thing.
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:56.040]   And he says, and this is interesting, that he doesn't want to chase the next thing.
[01:16:56.040 --> 01:16:58.040]   He says, I'm not saying we're not going to do anything else.
[01:16:58.040 --> 01:17:02.360]   I'm saying the phone is still on a smartphone is still an unbelievable product category
[01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:07.200]   to be in and not just for this quarter year or for years.
[01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:11.560]   So I wouldn't want to think anybody thinks this Oh, better days are behind us thing.
[01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:16.320]   So what he's really saying is, we're going to stick the course and yeah, I would expect
[01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:17.320]   that from Tim.
[01:17:17.320 --> 01:17:22.760]   But I do think you have to have some, you want to see some sparks, some innovation, something
[01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:23.760]   new, don't you?
[01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:27.080]   I think that even under a few jobs, we didn't really see that many new products.
[01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:32.440]   I mean, you know, we saw, you know, like, you know, Steve, look, let's, let's grant that
[01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:37.800]   Steve is unique, but he did pioneer several categories.
[01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:46.040]   The, the, the iPad, the iPhone, the iPod, those are all massive game changers and one
[01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:49.640]   but it's, but it's, but they didn't happen over, you know, they didn't all happen over
[01:17:49.640 --> 01:17:50.640]   a five year span.
[01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:53.200]   I mean, the, the, no, I understand it takes time.
[01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:56.440]   Do you think the car is the, is going to change the world?
[01:17:56.440 --> 01:17:57.440]   I don't think so.
[01:17:57.440 --> 01:18:00.240]   In fact, I think there's some great question where there apples even got the capability
[01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:01.240]   or the
[01:18:01.240 --> 01:18:03.920]   Don't let's drive to make it happen.
[01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:04.920]   It's there.
[01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:05.920]   There are two different questions here.
[01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:10.160]   And one of them is that I think that it's, I would definitely not want to be in Tim Cook's
[01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:13.640]   shoes, where it's not enough that I just do good work.
[01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:16.440]   It's not enough that I don't produce products that people like.
[01:18:16.440 --> 01:18:17.440]   Well, I'm saying this.
[01:18:17.440 --> 01:18:18.800]   It's a unique kind of pressure.
[01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:26.720]   Again, I'm so pleased by the insight we're given into what it's like to do Tim's job
[01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:27.640]   day after day.
[01:18:27.640 --> 01:18:32.240]   He talks about how the relationship that Apple products have with their customers and he's
[01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:38.160]   talking about personal stuff like not being really completely aware of how tangible that
[01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:39.760]   kind of relationship is.
[01:18:39.760 --> 01:18:45.840]   The first time he talks about the getting emails from customers, not just my phone stocks.
[01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:46.840]   Why is it?
[01:18:46.840 --> 01:18:48.400]   Why is this working properly?
[01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:53.800]   But like big thanks to FaceTime, I was able to be with my father when he was dying and
[01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:57.200]   because I could not be, I couldn't travel 3000 miles.
[01:18:57.200 --> 01:19:00.280]   And that's the sort of thing that I think really affects what he does day by day.
[01:19:00.280 --> 01:19:03.720]   I don't think he would have chosen that to talk about in such a large interview if it
[01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:06.400]   hadn't really hit him in such a such a big way.
[01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:11.400]   But the other problem is that it's not enough to just again be doing your job exceptionally
[01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:12.400]   well.
[01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:16.560]   You have to be really wonka people people casting you in this.
[01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:20.520]   I think the big difficulty is that and we see that here too.
[01:19:20.520 --> 01:19:25.520]   I'll personalize this one because it makes it easier to explain where people like to,
[01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:31.200]   on our four person panel, it's an easier story if it's here's the one person who is a true
[01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:32.440]   lover of Apple.
[01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:35.240]   And here's the person who hates Apple absolutely.
[01:19:35.240 --> 01:19:38.240]   And here's the person who's sort of above the fray doing this.
[01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:41.760]   But actually that's we switch off that role all the time.
[01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:42.760]   Minute by minute by minute.
[01:19:42.760 --> 01:19:44.120]   But it's easier to tell that story.
[01:19:44.120 --> 01:19:48.360]   And people want to tell the story about how Apple is this company that is going to be,
[01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:52.480]   it has this big bag of wiffle dust that they sprinkle over creating absolute magic as
[01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:57.640]   opposed to a team of engineers that works exceptionally hard trying to get things right.
[01:19:57.640 --> 01:20:01.200]   And a huge company with enough resources that they know that they can build whatever
[01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:03.360]   they want at their slightest whim.
[01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:07.240]   And so they can't just do things on their slightest whim because once they push that
[01:20:07.240 --> 01:20:11.840]   boulder off the top of the of the mountain, that's going to get bigger and bigger and bigger
[01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:13.720]   and pick up more and more speed.
[01:20:13.720 --> 01:20:18.160]   And before you know it, you're building something that's incredibly stupid, but you put 18 billion
[01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:23.440]   dollars into and half of that being a huge marketing push with billboards on every bus
[01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:24.440]   chaos.
[01:20:24.440 --> 01:20:27.400]   But this has always been the case with Apple, which is I would like to cut some slack.
[01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:30.920]   It just simply say, make good products, make things that you believe in, make things that
[01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:32.880]   have a point of view.
[01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:36.800]   And it's okay if this isn't something that we haven't seen in a while.
[01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:38.040]   Google can Google can do that.
[01:20:38.040 --> 01:20:41.040]   Google can create will just this week.
[01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:46.360]   It was discovered that they have on GitHub a brand new operating system that could be
[01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:47.840]   used for damn near anything.
[01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:48.840]   You should.
[01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:51.160]   And with Google, it could even be they this is an idea.
[01:20:51.160 --> 01:20:54.840]   They're playing around with they think in five years time it might be useful for something
[01:20:54.840 --> 01:20:58.360]   they might be making or it might be something that they just wanted to do as an open source
[01:20:58.360 --> 01:20:59.360]   project.
[01:20:59.360 --> 01:21:02.440]   When Apple does something, it's no, we have we're fixated on the idea that this is going
[01:21:02.440 --> 01:21:06.160]   to be something that's going to be tangible and sellable in two or three years.
[01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:09.840]   So that's a big that's a big yoke for them to wear.
[01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:21.160]   The book is big into AR these days in interview published on Thursday.
[01:21:21.160 --> 01:21:27.660]   And in fact, if this this this has lent some credence to the idea that maybe the iPhone
[01:21:27.660 --> 01:21:35.880]   is particularly all about AR and he talked to BuzzFeed news and said the company is bullish
[01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:38.000]   on AR.
[01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.680]   There's no substitute for human contact.
[01:21:40.680 --> 01:21:45.100]   Cook said and so you want the technology to encourage that.
[01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:51.000]   Is it too soon to think start talking about the iPhone eight and too soon to think about
[01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:54.320]   whether that might have an AR component?
[01:21:54.320 --> 01:21:56.280]   I think AR is going to be huge.
[01:21:56.280 --> 01:21:57.280]   So a big nerd ranch.
[01:21:57.280 --> 01:22:04.000]   We've already done a couple of proofs of concepts for like a museum and the effect
[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:05.200]   has been great.
[01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:10.200]   It can really augment learning and you know, we're all about the learning and I think
[01:22:10.200 --> 01:22:14.400]   it's very exciting that with AR, you take your phone out of the world instead of with
[01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:18.400]   VR where you lock yourself in a dark closet and play with your vibe.
[01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:24.680]   It's neat to go out and see the kids with the Pokemon go running around the neighborhood.
[01:22:24.680 --> 01:22:27.000]   I think it is a life affirming technology.
[01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:28.000]   Yeah.
[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:29.000]   Mm.
[01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:30.000]   But it's good.
[01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:33.880]   It depends on what conversion of AR you want to support.
[01:22:33.880 --> 01:22:38.600]   The Pokemon go is definitely what the technology can handle right now.
[01:22:38.600 --> 01:22:42.400]   What we imagine is having an augmented reality where I don't have to, you know, I don't
[01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:46.000]   have to walk around like this at any way in any way, shape or form.
[01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:50.440]   Because if you think it's distracting having having a Google glass on you, imagine have
[01:22:50.440 --> 01:22:55.040]   to look at someone who is kind of like doing this all the time as they're walking around.
[01:22:55.040 --> 01:22:56.040]   Yeah.
[01:22:56.040 --> 01:23:03.360]   I really think that AR and VR, it really is almost on the same sort of transient line
[01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:08.200]   as self-driving cars, autonomous vehicles where you can get a really good demo together.
[01:23:08.200 --> 01:23:12.080]   You can get a lot of really obvious ways in which would be cool, but then actually translating
[01:23:12.080 --> 01:23:16.000]   it to something you can actually make and sell and that people actually want to use.
[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:20.920]   That's the 5% of the problem that's going to take you 300% of your resources to solve.
[01:23:20.920 --> 01:23:25.560]   Do you think some of this comes to the fact that they've built now a phone that has basically
[01:23:25.560 --> 01:23:29.240]   super computing capabilities?
[01:23:29.240 --> 01:23:36.200]   And yet, it's just mostly playing Pokemon Go or sending messages.
[01:23:36.200 --> 01:23:41.280]   We did a lot of crazy things when technology first came.
[01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:50.000]   I mean, having Mac paint or things like that where you draw little things and you look
[01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:51.240]   what that's turned into.
[01:23:51.240 --> 01:23:55.240]   Is that is AR Apple's 21st century fat bits?
[01:23:55.240 --> 01:24:05.360]   Well, I think like Aaron said, when you look at AR and the things that are possible, maybe
[01:24:05.360 --> 01:24:13.560]   not right now, but look ahead and see what could be possible, that's going to be a pretty
[01:24:13.560 --> 01:24:14.880]   exciting thing.
[01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:16.160]   And it's in the real world.
[01:24:16.160 --> 01:24:22.640]   I mean, virtual reality, you lock yourself in a virtual world and you're basically by
[01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:25.160]   yourself.
[01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:30.000]   I think AR is most certainly the future.
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:31.000]   Yeah.
[01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000]   AR is about a whole lot more than gaming.
[01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:39.040]   VR, I mean, I guess so could VR be, but AR really is about user as a new user interface.
[01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:40.840]   I think it makes sense for Apple to think about it.
[01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:45.320]   BuzzFeed lists a bunch of moves over the last few years by Apple.
[01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:47.480]   In 2013, they bought PrimeSense.
[01:24:47.480 --> 01:24:52.520]   That was the Israeli company that did the Microsoft connect.
[01:24:52.520 --> 01:24:59.560]   In May 2015, it bought a German augmented reality firm, Matteo, a few months later, FaceShift.
[01:24:59.560 --> 01:25:04.880]   That's the company that did the real time motion capture and used in Star Wars.
[01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:11.760]   This year, VR scientist Yuri Petrov was a poached from Oculus.
[01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:21.600]   It's the most interesting AR, kind of an independent AR play right now, although Google has a fairly
[01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:23.320]   large stake in it.
[01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:27.200]   Doug Bowman, the director of the Center for Human Computer Interaction at Virginia Tech,
[01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:32.920]   he was on the Virginia Tech Cube of VR research space.
[01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:36.740]   And then of course, there are lots of patents, although I think I've never really trusted
[01:25:36.740 --> 01:25:39.480]   patents as a way of seeing where Apple might be going.
[01:25:39.480 --> 01:25:41.720]   They just patent everything as does everybody.
[01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:47.400]   But I think you have a really interesting point about the idea that Apple needs to do things
[01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:50.040]   that will take advantage of the supercomputer.
[01:25:50.040 --> 01:25:52.120]   I have my iPhone 4, right?
[01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:56.000]   What is that little thing?
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:57.600]   This has just been declared obsolete.
[01:25:57.600 --> 01:26:03.200]   But it had a retina display, it had a front-facing camera, it had a great little CPU.
[01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:07.440]   As long as we're not doing supercomputer type stuff, this is pretty much sufficient
[01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:08.680]   for the task.
[01:26:08.680 --> 01:26:13.080]   And so Apple, to get back into growth mode, really needs to find ways where it can play
[01:26:13.080 --> 01:26:14.440]   to its strengths.
[01:26:14.440 --> 01:26:17.320]   And AR is a natural thing to pursue.
[01:26:17.320 --> 01:26:19.680]   I don't know about that.
[01:26:19.680 --> 01:26:26.880]   How long would it take Apple to develop AR to the point where it is one of those big selling
[01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:29.720]   points?
[01:26:29.720 --> 01:26:35.400]   We all know that Apple will not release something until they can actually do something with
[01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:36.400]   it.
[01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:42.400]   And they've skipped technologies altogether.
[01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:46.080]   So I think that's a big question now.
[01:26:46.080 --> 01:26:48.000]   Where are they?
[01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.400]   And how long will it be?
[01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:52.240]   I'm still bullish on augmented reality.
[01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:58.320]   I think that maybe 2017 will be the year of augmented reality, maybe not.
[01:26:58.320 --> 01:26:59.960]   So Apple had what three events this year.
[01:26:59.960 --> 01:27:01.960]   They had WWDC.
[01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:03.920]   They had the September iPhone event.
[01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:07.160]   And then they announced the new MacBook Pros in October.
[01:27:07.160 --> 01:27:09.080]   I couldn't be here for that event.
[01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:16.800]   But I was listening in when the DJ, well, and Andy and Jason Hallo, Mega Moroni, and
[01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:19.960]   they were kind of making fun of it.
[01:27:19.960 --> 01:27:22.120]   I might not have DJ on iOS.
[01:27:22.120 --> 01:27:23.320]   It won an Apple Design Award.
[01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:26.000]   And it's used by millions of DJs around the world.
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.360]   I've been a DJ for almost 20 years.
[01:27:28.360 --> 01:27:31.720]   And I've been from turntables and vinyl all the way to digital.
[01:27:31.720 --> 01:27:34.960]   MacBook Pro is the standard for professional DJs.
[01:27:34.960 --> 01:27:37.840]   And we use dedicated controllers when we perform live on stage.
[01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:38.840]   Well, we touch bar.
[01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:39.840]   74 per frames more.
[01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:40.840]   And we have one built right in the left.
[01:27:40.840 --> 01:27:42.840]   That touch bar would make a good cross-fader.
[01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:44.120]   And the dynamic controls.
[01:27:44.120 --> 01:27:47.600]   The touch bar enables the next generation DJ software.
[01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:49.720]   Let's dive right in.
[01:27:49.720 --> 01:27:54.560]   On the touch bar, you have access to the core functionality of DJ Pro.
[01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:55.560]   Here is the sampler.
[01:27:55.560 --> 01:27:59.200]   We could indicate that the audience should raise their arms up in the air like they
[01:27:59.200 --> 01:28:00.720]   just don't care or not.
[01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:05.520]   But now I can graduate saying, sort of, put them up like you could do it.
[01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:06.520]   You could not.
[01:28:06.520 --> 01:28:08.720]   You're not really committed, but you're going to go along with it.
[01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:09.720]   You can multitouch.
[01:28:09.720 --> 01:28:11.720]   I can simultaneously apply a filter.
[01:28:11.720 --> 01:28:12.720]   Yeah.
[01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:13.720]   Nice.
[01:28:13.720 --> 01:28:21.120]   Now let's zoom into the wave.
[01:28:21.120 --> 01:28:22.120]   Drop it like it's hot.
[01:28:22.120 --> 01:28:23.120]   Drop it like it's lukewarm.
[01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:25.720]   Drop it like it's cool or cold.
[01:28:25.720 --> 01:28:29.720]   And I can precisely find a good point.
[01:28:29.720 --> 01:28:31.720]   Just don't like song right now.
[01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:35.320]   Although it does seem like there's a little bit of a lag there.
[01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:39.120]   I'll say that could be part of the software.
[01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:42.120]   Okay.
[01:28:42.120 --> 01:28:45.080]   Now we're ready to perform entirely with the touch bar.
[01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:50.080]   Let's take it for a spin.
[01:28:50.080 --> 01:28:57.080]   No pressure.
[01:28:57.080 --> 01:29:01.080]   They haven't mentioned the haptics.
[01:29:01.080 --> 01:29:05.080]   Yeah, they have to perfect the haptics.
[01:29:05.080 --> 01:29:09.040]   I mean, haptics would make that would take it to at least another level, especially in
[01:29:09.040 --> 01:29:13.840]   things like this because you don't necessarily know when, like at least from a musical perspective,
[01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:15.440]   timing is everything.
[01:29:15.440 --> 01:29:19.880]   And if you have that haptic kind of kick that gives you an extra layer to kind of know
[01:29:19.880 --> 01:29:25.560]   that you're on beat, let's say, versus just this like this tap on the screen that may
[01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:33.000]   or may not represent what you expect it to represent when you hear it through the speakers.
[01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:36.000]   Also we've seen how well haptics works on the new iPhone.
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.680]   Just when you're scrolling and say, oh, by the way, you've reached the end of the scroll
[01:29:38.680 --> 01:29:43.280]   and now you've bounced back.
[01:29:43.280 --> 01:29:50.280]   I'm going to do a little bit of this.
[01:29:50.280 --> 01:29:53.280]   I'm going to do a little bit of this.
[01:29:53.280 --> 01:29:57.280]   I'm going to do a little bit of this.
[01:29:57.280 --> 01:30:02.280]   I'm going to do a little bit of this.
[01:30:02.280 --> 01:30:07.280]   I'm going to do a little bit of this.
[01:30:07.280 --> 01:30:17.280]   I just thought he was sampling Andy and Akko in his cell, to be honest.
[01:30:17.280 --> 01:30:21.280]   I've used a lot of touch surfaces for music control.
[01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:27.280]   And like when I'm watching this and thinking about that tiny little strip in this regard,
[01:30:27.280 --> 01:30:31.280]   again, like I said, a couple of minutes ago, I'd rather have it than not have it.
[01:30:31.280 --> 01:30:36.760]   But having it, until I get to play with it, I'm not entirely sure that's going to give
[01:30:36.760 --> 01:30:39.440]   me exactly what I would need out of that.
[01:30:39.440 --> 01:30:42.760]   It would have to work really well for me to continue using it like that.
[01:30:42.760 --> 01:30:45.400]   It's a revolutionary tool for DJs.
[01:30:45.400 --> 01:30:49.560]   An update to DJ Pro is coming later this year and we absolutely can wait for you to check
[01:30:49.560 --> 01:30:50.560]   it out.
[01:30:50.560 --> 01:30:53.760]   Thank you.
[01:30:53.760 --> 01:30:56.320]   Andy really is good at that Sugar Hill gang.
[01:30:56.320 --> 01:31:02.000]   He can actually do that whole rapper's delight song, beginning to end.
[01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:06.480]   And he will do it at the drop of hats, so please, whatever you do, don't ask him.
[01:31:06.480 --> 01:31:11.480]   I think the big question of the year is we went through the year to me.
[01:31:11.480 --> 01:31:16.120]   And it's a question we actually are still dealing with is where Apple's going with the
[01:31:16.120 --> 01:31:17.120]   Macintosh.
[01:31:17.120 --> 01:31:22.600]   And I think there's some reasonable thought that they're abandoning their Pro users.
[01:31:22.600 --> 01:31:24.240]   Here's our discussion.
[01:31:24.240 --> 01:31:28.280]   What I find myself now looking at is that I really, you know, what I talked to a little
[01:31:28.280 --> 01:31:31.360]   bit before the commercial break is I really wish Apple would just release the Mac OS and
[01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:33.480]   let us run it on any hardware and stop worrying about it.
[01:31:33.480 --> 01:31:35.200]   I don't think that they're making hardware.
[01:31:35.200 --> 01:31:36.200]   Yeah.
[01:31:36.200 --> 01:31:37.800]   They're making hardware for professionals anymore.
[01:31:37.800 --> 01:31:39.920]   I don't think that the Mac Pro is.
[01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:40.920]   So that's, okay.
[01:31:40.920 --> 01:31:44.320]   So let's get, let's get down to it because that's really what this conversation is.
[01:31:44.320 --> 01:31:49.120]   And I led off with Microsoft just showing that they're at least eyeballing that market
[01:31:49.120 --> 01:31:54.800]   and trying to make something that might get that market excited with the Surface Studio.
[01:31:54.800 --> 01:32:01.480]   But really where this conversation begins is with the Apple event.
[01:32:01.480 --> 01:32:05.440]   And we've all been watching with interest to see, you know, to, for some commitment from
[01:32:05.440 --> 01:32:09.760]   Apple to the Macintosh is, you know, we've talked about how they haven't been updated
[01:32:09.760 --> 01:32:10.760]   much.
[01:32:10.760 --> 01:32:17.120]   But then we've also pointed out that Intel hasn't really given us a reason.
[01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:20.480]   There are new GPUs out there and so forth.
[01:32:20.480 --> 01:32:25.720]   And now they've announced laptops where it looks to some and you can, you know, you can
[01:32:25.720 --> 01:32:33.840]   go back and forth on this that Apple has prioritized thin and light and battery life over power.
[01:32:33.840 --> 01:32:38.320]   If I, if I hear thin and light one more time from that, from that, from that, well, in
[01:32:38.320 --> 01:32:42.800]   first this Apple said we're not going to put more than make more than 16 gigs of RAM available
[01:32:42.800 --> 01:32:46.560]   because we want to save battery life.
[01:32:46.560 --> 01:32:50.600]   So I think that pro will look at that right and say, well, that's not, I mean, I've heard
[01:32:50.600 --> 01:32:58.120]   you say I had a 32 gig Mac Pro and you said, well, that's about the minimum.
[01:32:58.120 --> 01:33:03.400]   You know, if you're using Photoshop, it's very memory hungry.
[01:33:03.400 --> 01:33:05.040]   I presume that a final cut is as well.
[01:33:05.040 --> 01:33:08.160]   Well, I believe that some of the restrictions and I can't remember where I read this was.
[01:33:08.160 --> 01:33:13.240]   I was looking through some, some articles that some of that might be some esoteric, well,
[01:33:13.240 --> 01:33:19.440]   not esoteric, but restrictions of the FAA related to checking, really 100, 100 watt
[01:33:19.440 --> 01:33:24.240]   hour max on the, and I don't know if that's true or not.
[01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:31.600]   Phil Schiller sent a note to a Mac rumors reader saying, thank you for the email.
[01:33:31.600 --> 01:33:35.800]   It's a good question to put more than 16 gigs of fast RAM in a notebook design at this time
[01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:40.200]   would require memory system that consumes much more power and wouldn't be efficient enough
[01:33:40.200 --> 01:33:41.720]   for a notebook.
[01:33:41.720 --> 01:33:44.160]   I hope you check out this new generation Mac book pro.
[01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:46.280]   It really is an incredible system.
[01:33:46.280 --> 01:33:50.440]   Maybe there are other reasons, but I mean, he himself said it was about battery life.
[01:33:50.440 --> 01:33:53.120]   It's complicated because there's that 100, 100 watt hours.
[01:33:53.120 --> 01:33:58.640]   So they want a certain, for instance, if they did all of that, they're still stuck with
[01:33:58.640 --> 01:34:00.160]   the same size battery.
[01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:03.640]   And so you end up with it lasting for an hour and a half if it's not plugged in.
[01:34:03.640 --> 01:34:04.720]   Oh, I see what you're saying.
[01:34:04.720 --> 01:34:09.040]   So if they were going to put more RAM in it, they'd want to put a bigger battery and then
[01:34:09.040 --> 01:34:10.680]   they would run up against.
[01:34:10.680 --> 01:34:12.640]   So it's a little bit complicated.
[01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:17.680]   So what happens is Intel Skylake still does not support the low power version of DDR4 RAM.
[01:34:17.680 --> 01:34:20.800]   That's been pushed to Kaby Lake and maybe it won't land in Kaby Lake.
[01:34:20.800 --> 01:34:21.800]   Maybe it'll go to coffee cake.
[01:34:21.800 --> 01:34:24.760]   It's not going to coffee lake or a cannon lake even.
[01:34:24.760 --> 01:34:28.680]   So in order to use low power, RAM Apple is limited to 16 gigabytes.
[01:34:28.680 --> 01:34:30.920]   They can go, oh, they can do what some other companies have done.
[01:34:30.920 --> 01:34:34.920]   And that is use a different chipset that allows you to put in more RAM, but then you
[01:34:34.920 --> 01:34:37.680]   don't get the low power version anymore and you get what Alex said, you get two hours
[01:34:37.680 --> 01:34:38.680]   of battery life.
[01:34:38.680 --> 01:34:41.760]   And it's a real restriction, the battery, you cannot ship, like you cannot literally
[01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:45.280]   ship it to customers or customers cannot take it on airplanes if that battery goes
[01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:46.560]   over a certain size.
[01:34:46.560 --> 01:34:50.080]   It's why the iPad Pro filled up the case with speakers and not battery, even though people
[01:34:50.080 --> 01:34:54.280]   like just put more battery and it becomes illegal at a certain size and a certain cell density
[01:34:54.280 --> 01:34:55.920]   to put more battery in.
[01:34:55.920 --> 01:35:00.360]   So the thinner and lighter is sort of Apple, lying is the wrong word.
[01:35:00.360 --> 01:35:03.800]   By choosing the parts that they chose, they are constrained to a certain size.
[01:35:03.800 --> 01:35:05.280]   They can't make the computer bigger.
[01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:07.960]   So the casing gets to shrink because all the other components have shrunk because that's
[01:35:07.960 --> 01:35:09.560]   what technology does over time.
[01:35:09.560 --> 01:35:12.240]   So they can literally like put the case in the dryer for a while and it ends up being
[01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:13.240]   smaller.
[01:35:13.240 --> 01:35:14.600]   But the smaller is not a design goal.
[01:35:14.600 --> 01:35:19.200]   The smaller and lighter is a result of them being on Kaby on Skylake, having this memory
[01:35:19.200 --> 01:35:22.960]   limitation, having this power envelope that they want, the thermal envelope that they
[01:35:22.960 --> 01:35:26.440]   have and the power levels they want to meet and then all of those parts come together
[01:35:26.440 --> 01:35:30.280]   and they basically wrap it up in a shiny aluminum coating.
[01:35:30.280 --> 01:35:36.160]   So it is an absolute limit of technology given the choice that Apple wants to make or their
[01:35:36.160 --> 01:35:39.640]   unwillingness to make a giant desktop version of a laptop.
[01:35:39.640 --> 01:35:42.080]   Well or a slightly thicker version of a desktop.
[01:35:42.080 --> 01:35:43.640]   It doesn't work either.
[01:35:43.640 --> 01:35:45.440]   It doesn't work either.
[01:35:45.440 --> 01:35:50.640]   Remember how just a month ago they were saying, oh, it's so hard.
[01:35:50.640 --> 01:35:51.800]   We have so little space.
[01:35:51.800 --> 01:35:56.160]   If only we had more space to put all kinds of wonderful things in these things.
[01:35:56.160 --> 01:35:57.960]   But that's a tiny problem.
[01:35:57.960 --> 01:35:59.920]   But you have no battery constraint.
[01:35:59.920 --> 01:36:03.920]   I'm saying that a laptop, you could make it a larger case.
[01:36:03.920 --> 01:36:09.160]   Even if you're constrained by what you can do with battery size, you can still make it
[01:36:09.160 --> 01:36:13.240]   really one of the best high end laptops you can possibly can in terms of convenience and
[01:36:13.240 --> 01:36:14.240]   features.
[01:36:14.240 --> 01:36:19.080]   But they decided they wanted to make it make it three millimeters thinner.
[01:36:19.080 --> 01:36:22.200]   It would be a bigger case that is still empty because the components would be the same size
[01:36:22.200 --> 01:36:23.200]   inside it.
[01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:26.440]   Well, you could fill it with a decent keyboard.
[01:36:26.440 --> 01:36:30.280]   You could fill it with all kinds of other things.
[01:36:30.280 --> 01:36:32.040]   You wouldn't be filled with air.
[01:36:32.040 --> 01:36:38.160]   And I know that we're obsessed with these USB, you know, USB C. But limiting us to only
[01:36:38.160 --> 01:36:41.200]   those just means that we have, I just have a whole bunch of other things that I now have
[01:36:41.200 --> 01:36:42.840]   to have in my bag just to connect to it.
[01:36:42.840 --> 01:36:46.080]   I still look back at when Andy said that we would miss the ethernet.
[01:36:46.080 --> 01:36:50.760]   And I think of that, you know, every day because I'm talking on ethernet cable, computer.
[01:36:50.760 --> 01:36:52.800]   And we're talking about pro users.
[01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:57.160]   So the thing is, is we're not talking about, you know, I get it to have like one or two
[01:36:57.160 --> 01:37:02.600]   USB C's in a consumer laptop in the Mac book or whatever.
[01:37:02.600 --> 01:37:05.680]   But when you're talking about pros, we're going to hook peripherals in, you know, and
[01:37:05.680 --> 01:37:10.760]   we're going to be on the road where a MagSafe is really an important piece of material for
[01:37:10.760 --> 01:37:11.760]   us.
[01:37:11.760 --> 01:37:16.000]   And, you know, I'm now looking back to the years where my computer got yanked off of,
[01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:19.200]   you know, I'm looking at this USB C as power.
[01:37:19.200 --> 01:37:24.800]   And considering the years that I had my computers yanked off my desk, had the pins bent broken,
[01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:28.760]   you know, all of those things had gone away with the MagSafe for a long time.
[01:37:28.760 --> 01:37:35.440]   And Apple chose to, you know, take that out, you know, which was, you know, I almost want
[01:37:35.440 --> 01:37:39.920]   someone to build like a case with a battery that goes around my Mac book, you know, a
[01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:43.800]   MacBook Pro that builds me a flush Maglo.
[01:37:43.800 --> 01:37:48.400]   I mean, I'm like, like a lot of real size mophie.
[01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:49.400]   Yeah, right.
[01:37:49.400 --> 01:37:50.400]   But there are more fun.
[01:37:50.400 --> 01:37:55.080]   I mean, with all due respect, Alex, there are more fundamental issues, the lack of more
[01:37:55.080 --> 01:37:59.800]   than 16 gigs of RAM, it's DDR3, not DDR4 RAM.
[01:37:59.800 --> 01:38:05.520]   We're now learning the details of the Radeon that is in there, the Polaris architecture,
[01:38:05.520 --> 01:38:07.880]   very unimpressive compare.
[01:38:07.880 --> 01:38:14.160]   I guess the real point in a lot of people are saying is I can buy a PC laptop for half the
[01:38:14.160 --> 01:38:16.920]   price with twice the power.
[01:38:16.920 --> 01:38:22.600]   And Apple, because they're the only people who make this thing, Apple's really turning
[01:38:22.600 --> 01:38:24.680]   its back on the power user.
[01:38:24.680 --> 01:38:25.680]   But here's the thing.
[01:38:25.680 --> 01:38:29.160]   I mean, and, you know, and Alex can certainly talk to this more.
[01:38:29.160 --> 01:38:35.040]   It feels to me as though the laptop is never going to be your main machine that you know,
[01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:38.680]   it's old, but there's a lot of people.
[01:38:38.680 --> 01:38:44.480]   Well, and I think that's what Apple's proposing is that that or your iPad Pro is also saying
[01:38:44.480 --> 01:38:49.360]   that a power user is changing like John Densidarski was very vocal on Twitter saying, I'm a power
[01:38:49.360 --> 01:38:50.360]   user.
[01:38:50.360 --> 01:38:52.720]   I don't do any video, but you can't not call me a power user.
[01:38:52.720 --> 01:38:55.640]   And I love this, or I don't know if you say a lot of it, but he really liked there's
[01:38:55.640 --> 01:38:57.480]   based on at least the responses I'm getting.
[01:38:57.480 --> 01:39:01.520]   There is a huge gulf now in what we determine as a power user.
[01:39:01.520 --> 01:39:03.200]   Video professionals absolutely hate this machine.
[01:39:03.200 --> 01:39:04.360]   They hate the RAM limits.
[01:39:04.360 --> 01:39:05.920]   They hate the, they hate the interconnects.
[01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:06.920]   They hate everything.
[01:39:06.920 --> 01:39:10.520]   All the choices made in here, but there is this huge other swap of people who also self
[01:39:10.520 --> 01:39:12.440]   identify as professionals.
[01:39:12.440 --> 01:39:16.080]   Even some of them who do photography, not all photographers, but developers and people
[01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:20.360]   in design industries and all sorts of other areas who absolutely consider themselves pros
[01:39:20.360 --> 01:39:23.200]   and are thrilled to have modern high speed connects on this thing, just thrilled to
[01:39:23.200 --> 01:39:27.120]   have a P3 to thrilled to have a P3 display and are thrilled to have the things that Apple
[01:39:27.120 --> 01:39:28.120]   is focusing on.
[01:39:28.120 --> 01:39:32.160]   So I think it's also dangerous when you just lump all power users into one big bucket.
[01:39:32.160 --> 01:39:33.160]   Alex, I'm sorry.
[01:39:33.160 --> 01:39:39.080]   You're talking like the 4K, you know, you're talking about the retina, the 5K retina IMac.
[01:39:39.080 --> 01:39:45.400]   I mean, that's a 4 gigahertz Intel core quad core I7.
[01:39:45.400 --> 01:39:48.520]   And it's, I mean, that's on mine, which is the, was the original one.
[01:39:48.520 --> 01:39:50.560]   I don't know what the current, current speeds are.
[01:39:50.560 --> 01:39:51.920]   It's going to be a lot faster.
[01:39:51.920 --> 01:39:53.360]   It's going to have a better screen.
[01:39:53.360 --> 01:39:55.440]   There's just no question about that.
[01:39:55.440 --> 01:40:00.120]   And so the laptops, yeah, they're fine machines.
[01:40:00.120 --> 01:40:01.120]   Don't get me wrong.
[01:40:01.120 --> 01:40:03.320]   They're just never going to match up to the desktops.
[01:40:03.320 --> 01:40:04.720]   I don't, but that's not one word.
[01:40:04.720 --> 01:40:09.600]   Yeah, but, but it's like there are a lot of people that I can't afford to have a top
[01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:12.920]   of the line MacBook and a top of the line IMac.
[01:40:12.920 --> 01:40:19.760]   Okay, this is, this is going to be my, it's very correct to say that you can't really
[01:40:19.760 --> 01:40:23.320]   define one person, one type of person as a professional user.
[01:40:23.320 --> 01:40:27.240]   There are a lot of people for whom this is going to be the hub of my entire life, whether
[01:40:27.240 --> 01:40:31.880]   you're working in an office or yourself employed, you're a writer, you're a photographer, whatever.
[01:40:31.880 --> 01:40:37.600]   And it, I think that something that gets thrown under the bus is people who don't necessarily
[01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:40.720]   want extreme high power, but they want convenience.
[01:40:40.720 --> 01:40:46.480]   They don't want to have to travel with a increasingly big bag full of dongles and attachments.
[01:40:46.480 --> 01:40:50.520]   They don't want, they want to have a comfortable keyboard or even a decent keyboard to work
[01:40:50.520 --> 01:40:55.920]   with that saving three millimeters off the thickness of a device adds nothing to the
[01:40:55.920 --> 01:40:57.800]   power of the device.
[01:40:57.800 --> 01:41:03.000]   And once again, we have the, we just butt heads with a situation that if this were Dell who
[01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:06.320]   decided to make these changes, okay, well, if that's too bad, I guess I'll take a look
[01:41:06.320 --> 01:41:12.720]   at Lenovo, take a look at what Microsoft is doing with my, with Apple, it becomes, is
[01:41:12.720 --> 01:41:15.720]   this the machine that I do I need a machine of this, of this class?
[01:41:15.720 --> 01:41:19.960]   Yes, or does this, is there, is there a platform wide limitation that I can't work around?
[01:41:19.960 --> 01:41:21.120]   No, yes, there is.
[01:41:21.120 --> 01:41:25.680]   So, okay, so I guess that you're kind of screwed out of having a mobile Macintosh for the entire
[01:41:25.680 --> 01:41:26.680]   future.
[01:41:26.680 --> 01:41:29.480]   And I know so much better than the previous MacBook.
[01:41:29.480 --> 01:41:33.160]   I mean, the 12 inch MacBook was a disaster that way.
[01:41:33.160 --> 01:41:37.560]   Well, you as a C4 compared to fourth under both ports.
[01:41:37.560 --> 01:41:43.440]   The 12 inch, the 12 inch MacBook had had an advantage in that it was designed to be smaller.
[01:41:43.440 --> 01:41:44.720]   It was designed to be lighter.
[01:41:44.720 --> 01:41:48.600]   It was for people who wanted to make that vote for people who were frustrated maybe that,
[01:41:48.600 --> 01:41:54.560]   gee, I really wish there was something even lighter than I wish there was, I envy somewhat
[01:41:54.560 --> 01:41:58.920]   of the windows, ultra lights that are more powerful than a MacBook Air have the higher
[01:41:58.920 --> 01:42:02.560]   density screen, have a touch screen, have all these really nice creature comforts, but
[01:42:02.560 --> 01:42:04.080]   are super, super light.
[01:42:04.080 --> 01:42:07.160]   And if you didn't like it, that's no problem because there's still MacBook Airs, there
[01:42:07.160 --> 01:42:10.320]   are still MacBook nothings, excuse me, there's still a Mac that throws up there.
[01:42:10.320 --> 01:42:12.280]   I don't think complaint is about the Macs that they're offering.
[01:42:12.280 --> 01:42:16.400]   The complaint is that there isn't one more Mac that's a no compromise MacBook.
[01:42:16.400 --> 01:42:17.360]   It made a lower-
[01:42:17.360 --> 01:42:20.520]   I think you version that took out all the, like you could get one with less ports and
[01:42:20.520 --> 01:42:23.680]   you could get one without the magic bar, but you can't get one on top of the 15 inches
[01:42:23.680 --> 01:42:26.880]   that says, "Hey, we're giving you a couple extra ports, we're giving you a better graphics
[01:42:26.880 --> 01:42:27.880]   option."
[01:42:27.880 --> 01:42:30.800]   Yeah, there's less battery life, but if you keep it plugged in at your desk most of the
[01:42:30.800 --> 01:42:34.440]   time or plugged in at work most of the time, then you don't care, you have this offering.
[01:42:34.440 --> 01:42:36.080]   And that to me is the harder part.
[01:42:36.080 --> 01:42:39.560]   The dongles I don't really care about, the MacBook helped me get rid of those.
[01:42:39.560 --> 01:42:41.120]   I'll keep dongles for a year.
[01:42:41.120 --> 01:42:45.280]   And I was looking after this event because I was furious about the ports and the lack
[01:42:45.280 --> 01:42:46.280]   of dongles.
[01:42:46.280 --> 01:42:49.880]   And I realized I had the MagSafe 1 to MagSafe 2 adapter, the ethernet adapter that had to
[01:42:49.880 --> 01:42:52.440]   then change from this kind of ethernet adapter to that.
[01:42:52.440 --> 01:42:55.240]   And I've stopped over the course of the year, I've stopped using them.
[01:42:55.240 --> 01:42:56.760]   And it's easy to stop using a dongle.
[01:42:56.760 --> 01:42:59.680]   It is impossible to take an old connector and make it a new iPhone.
[01:42:59.680 --> 01:43:03.680]   If you just bought a new iPhone 7, you can't connect it to your MacBook Pro.
[01:43:03.680 --> 01:43:04.680]   I haven't connected my iPhone.
[01:43:04.680 --> 01:43:07.640]   And frankly, you have to have two pairs of headphones now.
[01:43:07.640 --> 01:43:08.640]   Good for you Renee.
[01:43:08.640 --> 01:43:10.440]   Yeah, but lots of other people do.
[01:43:10.440 --> 01:43:15.480]   And now you need two kinds of headphones because the headphones that work, I mean, it's as
[01:43:15.480 --> 01:43:19.160]   if, I don't know, it seems like they could have done one more.
[01:43:19.160 --> 01:43:20.720]   I'm just looking at, I'm just looking at like, scheduling.
[01:43:20.720 --> 01:43:24.120]   I don't even use headphones and I've got four pairs sitting on my desk.
[01:43:24.120 --> 01:43:26.320]   I mean, there's, like I said, there's absolutely fine.
[01:43:26.320 --> 01:43:29.640]   And there was a scheduling snafu here because that iPhone, this MacBook was supposed to
[01:43:29.640 --> 01:43:30.840]   be out before that iPhone.
[01:43:30.840 --> 01:43:37.000]   So that iPhone would not exist in the world with this thing actually shipped on time.
[01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:42.320]   And they don't, and they, and there is the lightning USB, USB C cable.
[01:43:42.320 --> 01:43:45.480]   Yeah, no, there's no, you have dongles that can make it work with everything.
[01:43:45.480 --> 01:43:47.880]   But I would, I would, I would, another case, different cable.
[01:43:47.880 --> 01:43:50.080]   I mean, you know, you're paying $3,000 for a laptop.
[01:43:50.080 --> 01:43:51.080]   I'll tell you that.
[01:43:51.080 --> 01:43:52.080]   Yeah.
[01:43:52.080 --> 01:43:53.080]   Two thousand dollars for a laptop.
[01:43:53.080 --> 01:43:54.080]   Yeah.
[01:43:54.080 --> 01:43:55.080]   Yeah.
[01:43:55.080 --> 01:43:57.280]   It's now a couple of the couple of capes here and there is in the big deal.
[01:43:57.280 --> 01:43:58.280]   It's not the money.
[01:43:58.280 --> 01:44:01.600]   It is that, you know, I spend a lot, I mean, I, I do 250,000 miles a year on the, on the
[01:44:01.600 --> 01:44:02.600]   road.
[01:44:02.600 --> 01:44:05.640]   And, and the thing is, is that for me, it's all about, I can't go somewhere now and get
[01:44:05.640 --> 01:44:07.480]   a connector that's going to work.
[01:44:07.480 --> 01:44:11.040]   You know, like with a, a regular USB, for instance, you know, now I got to figure that
[01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:12.040]   out.
[01:44:12.040 --> 01:44:14.160]   If I, if I lost something, forgot something.
[01:44:14.160 --> 01:44:17.400]   And then again, the number one reason I don't travel, I got a 12 inch, you know, a little
[01:44:17.400 --> 01:44:19.120]   MacBook or whatever.
[01:44:19.120 --> 01:44:22.640]   And the number one reason I stopped using it was because I didn't have a MagSafe.
[01:44:22.640 --> 01:44:26.680]   Like, like, like when I'm traveling, it is getting my computers or sitting on my lap.
[01:44:26.680 --> 01:44:27.680]   They're getting pulled.
[01:44:27.680 --> 01:44:28.680]   They're getting pushed there, whatever.
[01:44:28.680 --> 01:44:31.520]   And I was like, I was, I was just, I was going to break it.
[01:44:31.520 --> 01:44:34.960]   I was going to break it, you know, and I'm just, and, and when you're used to a MagSafe,
[01:44:34.960 --> 01:44:38.600]   I mean, it is one of the best things that Apple ever created and to take it out of the
[01:44:38.600 --> 01:44:43.440]   laptop line is literally, you know, I don't, you know, I'm kind of mystified by that.
[01:44:43.440 --> 01:44:49.680]   You know, it's, it is a, you know, because it is the thing when you're as a road warrior,
[01:44:49.680 --> 01:44:53.200]   it is the thing that you, you know, people kick it out all the time.
[01:44:53.200 --> 01:44:56.520]   And you just, you're, you're always plugging it back in going, I'm really glad that wasn't
[01:44:56.520 --> 01:44:59.240]   a hard connection, you know, to my, to my computer.
[01:44:59.240 --> 01:45:03.120]   And, and especially the way these things are built where they're basically not really
[01:45:03.120 --> 01:45:05.080]   fixable if they break.
[01:45:05.080 --> 01:45:08.920]   So, so they're, you know, they're, you know, those kinds of things are, are going to be
[01:45:08.920 --> 01:45:12.640]   lethal, you know, and, and so, and, you know, we, we have a lot of them, you know, so I
[01:45:12.640 --> 01:45:16.720]   have, you know, it's, it's not just that I'm, that I have a MacBook Pro, like, you know,
[01:45:16.720 --> 01:45:19.480]   I have, I have 40 of them, you know, like we are in the company.
[01:45:19.480 --> 01:45:24.000]   And so we have to decide when and how we're going to upgrade those and, you know, and,
[01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:25.000]   and so on so forth.
[01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:29.640]   And I don't know, like, like I literally don't know how I'm going to manage that process.
[01:45:29.640 --> 01:45:33.160]   You know, we'll do it begrudgingly at some point, but it's, you know, I'm just sure that
[01:45:33.160 --> 01:45:34.160]   I'm in half of them.
[01:45:34.160 --> 01:45:35.160]   I get messed up.
[01:45:35.160 --> 01:45:39.440]   I accept that Apple can't make a computer for everybody.
[01:45:39.440 --> 01:45:42.120]   It can't even make one computer for the five of us.
[01:45:42.120 --> 01:45:43.120]   Yes.
[01:45:43.120 --> 01:45:49.680]   So I understand that, but it, and I'm not even complaining because frankly, the MacBook
[01:45:49.680 --> 01:45:56.480]   Pro is fine for me, but I'm, I'm, I do see a lot of people saying we wish there were
[01:45:56.480 --> 01:45:57.480]   more power.
[01:45:57.480 --> 01:45:59.120]   He's on the space station.
[01:45:59.120 --> 01:46:00.120]   Oh my gosh.
[01:46:00.120 --> 01:46:01.120]   Say hi to Commander Kelly.
[01:46:01.120 --> 01:46:03.120]   Oh, well, okay.
[01:46:03.120 --> 01:46:13.040]   Now you have to download the video.
[01:46:13.040 --> 01:46:14.640]   He's floating in space.
[01:46:14.640 --> 01:46:17.240]   You do a weightless very well, Alex.
[01:46:17.240 --> 01:46:19.880]   Actually, no, that's, that's not quite what I see.
[01:46:19.880 --> 01:46:26.000]   I usually see them like you see a shot like this or like Alex and he's yeah.
[01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.600]   Oh, you got the $300 book.
[01:46:28.600 --> 01:46:33.360]   So I already picked up the smaller one and she had a great set of photos and videos
[01:46:33.360 --> 01:46:37.000]   that we'll be putting up, but I got the bigger one just because I was silly and wow, is it
[01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:38.000]   big?
[01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:39.000]   Yeah.
[01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:40.000]   And huge.
[01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.800]   A good gift for somebody who really likes Apple stuff.
[01:46:42.800 --> 01:46:46.320]   A reading from the book of jobs.
[01:46:46.320 --> 01:46:47.320]   Chapter three.
[01:46:47.320 --> 01:46:48.320]   No way.
[01:46:48.320 --> 01:46:50.320]   Three s to iPhone five.
[01:46:50.320 --> 01:46:51.320]   Well, and yay.
[01:46:51.320 --> 01:46:59.480]   The headphone jack did a Fendi and so did the Johnny pluck it out.
[01:46:59.480 --> 01:47:04.320]   Actually, now that I notice you have three penguins in view, at least.
[01:47:04.320 --> 01:47:05.320]   Are you?
[01:47:05.320 --> 01:47:07.680]   I can see at least five.
[01:47:07.680 --> 01:47:08.680]   What?
[01:47:08.680 --> 01:47:09.680]   Oh, four.
[01:47:09.680 --> 01:47:10.680]   Holy cow.
[01:47:10.680 --> 01:47:11.680]   You can't.
[01:47:11.680 --> 01:47:12.680]   Five.
[01:47:12.680 --> 01:47:13.680]   You can't see the post behind me.
[01:47:13.680 --> 01:47:14.680]   No, I see five.
[01:47:14.680 --> 01:47:15.680]   I see.
[01:47:15.680 --> 01:47:17.320]   Is that light switch a penguin?
[01:47:17.320 --> 01:47:18.320]   Light switch is a penguin.
[01:47:18.320 --> 01:47:19.320]   Holy camole.
[01:47:19.320 --> 01:47:20.920]   Which this is a good game we could play.
[01:47:20.920 --> 01:47:26.120]   I spy with my little eye a flightless bird.
[01:47:26.120 --> 01:47:31.880]   But yes, also a word out here to Bruno, who has been exceptionally well behaved this
[01:47:31.880 --> 01:47:32.880]   afternoon.
[01:47:32.880 --> 01:47:33.880]   Thank you.
[01:47:33.880 --> 01:47:34.880]   And he's a beautiful.
[01:47:34.880 --> 01:47:35.880]   Is he an African?
[01:47:35.880 --> 01:47:36.880]   What is he?
[01:47:36.880 --> 01:47:37.880]   He's an African gray.
[01:47:37.880 --> 01:47:38.880]   Beautiful color.
[01:47:38.880 --> 01:47:39.880]   Look at that.
[01:47:39.880 --> 01:47:40.880]   Hmm.
[01:47:40.880 --> 01:47:45.000]   And somebody in the chat room said, rich looks like the kind of guy who kisses his parrot.
[01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:46.000]   Yes he is.
[01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:50.840]   Oh, anyway, the only time I have to deal with Skype is this show.
[01:47:50.840 --> 01:47:51.840]   Something I'm bitter.
[01:47:51.840 --> 01:47:55.160]   Yeah, I just let you know how much I love you guys.
[01:47:55.160 --> 01:47:56.640]   Well, come here to deal with it.
[01:47:56.640 --> 01:48:01.200]   This is why it's such a good timing that I'm here in the studio because if I were back
[01:48:01.200 --> 01:48:05.280]   in Boston, I couldn't do this right now.
[01:48:05.280 --> 01:48:06.280]   Aw.
[01:48:06.280 --> 01:48:07.280]   Hey.
[01:48:07.280 --> 01:48:08.280]   [MUSIC]
[01:48:08.280 --> 01:48:17.960]   I love doing Mac break weekly.
[01:48:17.960 --> 01:48:20.760]   I'll tell you, I know sometimes people think I'm not an Apple fan.
[01:48:20.760 --> 01:48:21.760]   I am.
[01:48:21.760 --> 01:48:24.200]   I'm a, you know, I am a, I got an Apple watch.
[01:48:24.200 --> 01:48:25.360]   I got an iPhone.
[01:48:25.360 --> 01:48:27.720]   I got Mac and Tasha's all over the place.
[01:48:27.720 --> 01:48:30.600]   I've been a Macintosh lover.
[01:48:30.600 --> 01:48:36.800]   But since I bought my first one in the first hundred days in 1984 and, and watch with great
[01:48:36.800 --> 01:48:42.400]   interest easily the most interesting company and technology Apple computers easily.
[01:48:42.400 --> 01:48:45.480]   So I have a feeling we'll have a lot more to watch in 2017.
[01:48:45.480 --> 01:48:47.560]   And I hope you will do it with us right here.
[01:48:47.560 --> 01:48:54.240]   The Enoco Renee Richie, me and our many guests every Tuesday, 11 a.m. Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern
[01:48:54.240 --> 01:48:57.560]   time, 1900 UTC for Mac break weekly.
[01:48:57.560 --> 01:48:58.560]   Stop by and watch.
[01:48:58.560 --> 01:48:59.560]   Will you?
[01:48:59.560 --> 01:49:00.840]   If not, you can always download it.
[01:49:00.840 --> 01:49:03.160]   And I hope you have a wonderful 2017.
[01:49:03.160 --> 01:49:06.880]   Thanks for joining us on our best of episode.
[01:49:06.880 --> 01:49:10.440]   Thanks to a Carson Bonny, our producer for putting it together and our editors.
[01:49:10.440 --> 01:49:12.000]   I don't, who did the editing on this?
[01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:13.000]   Brian Burnett.
[01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.360]   Brian is doing all of these best jobs.
[01:49:15.360 --> 01:49:19.480]   I think he did a really bang up job.
[01:49:19.480 --> 01:49:21.480]   And thank you for all your suggestions.
[01:49:21.480 --> 01:49:23.640]   It helped us put this together.
[01:49:23.640 --> 01:49:24.920]   Happy New Year everybody.
[01:49:24.920 --> 01:49:26.480]   We'll see you in 2017.
[01:49:26.480 --> 01:49:27.480]   Bye bye.
[01:49:27.480 --> 01:49:30.640]   Oh, I guess I should say now it's time to get back to work.
[01:49:30.640 --> 01:49:31.640]   Are you really working?
[01:49:31.640 --> 01:49:33.200]   Because break time is over.
[01:49:33.200 --> 01:49:33.760]   Bye bye.
[01:49:33.760 --> 01:49:43.760]   [MUSIC]
