[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.160]   Yes, I'm back. Thanks to Andy Inako and Jason Stelfer filling in while I've been on vacation
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.720]   and look low and behold, they came back anyway. Well, Andy did anyway. Andy Inako, Chicago Sun
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:58.400]   Time, CWOB.com. Hello, sir. I just wanted to see your new tattoo. I got a, well, they told me it
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:04.720]   was a whale, but now I'm looking at it. I don't know what it is. But by the time you have the three
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.920]   mirrors, you can actually see it with your own eyes. It's going to be reversed a couple times.
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.480]   Okay, maybe that's the problem. He's swimming right to left, not left to right.
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.600]   Also, Renee Richie's here from iMoor.com and Mac Break Weekly. Hi, Renee.
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.760]   Hi, Leo. It's great to have you back. It's not the same with that yet.
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.320]   So anything happened while I was gone? Nope. No, quite two weeks. Andy and I went camping.
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.280]   Man, you can lately was good. I couldn't watch the Apple event because I was on a plane,
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.040]   but of course, as soon as we landed, I ordered an iPad Pro.
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.400]   This was new. Get it. As far as we know, this is exactly what the rumors said
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:47.680]   six months ago, right? The 10.5 inch. But I've been reading your reviews of it, Renee. I mean,
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:54.080]   you're singing its praises. My favorite iPad just got even better. That's serenity, but I think
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.200]   you can concur, right? It's phenomenal. And not for reasons I thought, like there was a lot of
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.560]   stuff that leaked about it, but ProMotion didn't really get a lot of attention before the leak.
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.560]   And when you see it in person, especially, some people won't notice it. Some people don't notice
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.480]   difference. I don't notice differences in sound, but I do notice differences in visuals. And once
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.520]   you see a adaptive 120 Hertz on a real display and you see text that you can read while it's
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.560]   flicking and you see a movie at 24 frames per second while you're drawing it 120 Hertz on the
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.320]   other side, it's really hard to go back even to a previous iPad Pro.
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.480]   You would. Okay. So it doesn't always do it. It scales the frame rate up and down. It can
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:35.040]   go as fast as 120 cycles per second, which is. Yes. So two or four times faster than the normal
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.400]   monitor. Most monitors are 30 TVs, 30. Many computer monitors are 60 frames per second,
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:46.320]   120 frames per second. And is that only for the pencil? No, so it was 60 frames per second on the
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:51.840]   previous generation 9.7 inch iPad Pro and it would down, it would go down if it needed to to save
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.360]   power on the new one. It can also go up. So the minute the pencil touches the screen,
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.800]   it automatically goes to 120 Hertz. And then we'll play back lower frames per second video using math.
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.560]   Like it'll just do with five frames, you know, if it wants to hold a 24 frames per second.
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.960]   But also apps can ask for the higher refresh rate if they think they need it. And then it has like
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.240]   a little dispatch here in iOS that goes, okay, you can have it now. This is how we're going to match
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.680]   this panel to that panel. So we're going to do for your video. So we're going to do it with the pencil
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.760]   and it sort of works all that stuff out for you. That it sounds fairly sophisticated. I don't
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.760]   know of any device that does anything like that. It's what they said is a complete hardware
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.280]   software silicon solution, which is what they're which only Apple can do really. I mean,
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.240]   well, it's Microsoft. You could have a Samsung version where it's in certain Samsung apps and
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.560]   you have to have the user choose a profile you want when you go into the app. Right. So,
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.680]   I didn't notice that. I didn't notice better sound. Is there better sound? Because it seems
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.920]   like it's much more stereo than it was before. It sounds really good. The company line is that
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.840]   it is the same great speaker system as a previous one, but many people do say it sounds better.
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.920]   I'm not very good at music. So I have to defer to people like you who have better
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:59.120]   better. Not with the headphones, but I feel like the sound is more extremely stereo.
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.800]   And I mean, it's slightly bigger and it is a big echo cavern. So who knows? Yeah, maybe.
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:08.240]   That's the thing, of course, you'll immediately notice is that so it isn't the same exact physical
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.560]   sizes and 9.7. I had to get a new smart keyboard. It's slightly better. You can use the old smart
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.360]   keyboard and just sticks out a little bit. Yeah. And you'll lose the full size idness.
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:23.280]   And then, yeah, and I actually, you know, I really think, well, we'll talk about this. So anyway,
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:28.000]   the bezel on the top and the bottom is shrunk. And is there the size? Yeah, they're a little
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.600]   smaller too, aren't they? Yeah. The whole thing. They wanted to put as big a screen as they could
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:36.320]   in a smaller package as they could. So it's about 20% bigger screen, but only a few percentage point
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:42.320]   bigger physical device. Yeah. They really haven't really haven't traded off the convenience of it.
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.880]   If you're afraid that the smaller bezel is going to mean that you can't really hold it lazily
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:50.800]   while you're reading a comic book or watching TV or something without accidentally hitting the
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.240]   screen, maybe you will hit the screen, but it's smart enough to realize that. No, no, no, he's
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:59.440]   just holding the screen. So I've only been using it for a couple of days, but it's nothing but up
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:09.600]   so far. Yeah. And it's fast. It's the 10x process. Now, again, I think this is one of those things
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:15.680]   that for two reasons you might not notice one because benchmark show speed, but in the real use
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:20.960]   that whatever 20% increase doesn't necessarily translate to something you notice.
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:27.440]   Is Serendi was in Procreate and she was saving? I just assumed she was saving out jpegs and she
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:32.560]   said, no, I'm saving the movie files. Yeah. That's where you know this is there's certain things
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:38.000]   that seem to be faster. That's where you really notice where if you've been using one, but for
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.640]   most the most part programs are going to operate the same because they're not they weren't taxing
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:46.560]   the old processor. And the bigger one is a little bit smoother. Like the bigger one you'd press
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:50.080]   the home button, for example, and you'd see the icon sort of immediately go down where this one,
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:54.160]   you can actually see like the smoothness of them animating through just because it can push around
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.280]   those pick those many more pixels much more easily. Well, and the higher frame rate, I would
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:03.280]   imagine, right? Yeah. What is a little disappointing is that Apple, every time they increase the size
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:06.960]   of the screen and the number of pixels screen, they never change springboard. So it's really,
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:12.320]   I mean, you don't get to take put more icons in the screen or anything like that. It's just a
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:17.520]   you'll get a new doc with iOS 11. Well, and that's to me, that's the most interesting thing. You
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:22.560]   know, I took a laptop computer with me on the vacation and I, you know, use Lightroom and
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:27.040]   a process, my photos and all that stuff. But I really, as I'm watching this and thinking about
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:31.520]   this iPad, and I did bring an iPad pro with me thinking I probably could have brought a much
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:37.280]   lighter weight, easier device, especially with the changes that they're going to make in iOS 11.
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:43.200]   Yeah, that's all it's now it's getting it's what we expected, which is that Apple would move iOS
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:48.720]   and the iPad closer to a computing fully operational. Yeah. For instance, there's a file manager,
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:52.720]   you can look at the file system for the first time ever. And it's a download. So if you really
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:57.200]   hate file systems, you'd never have to have to want one. Just go get it and it works great.
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:03.040]   Kind of how Andy's not exactly. Not when people say a file system or a file manager,
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:07.680]   that's not like what you see, like on a Mac or on Windows or on Android, you can't go to go to
[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:12.720]   root and start rooting around in libraries. But it gives it's typical Apple solution to a problem
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:17.280]   saying if people are asking that they want to have a file manager, they don't really want to be
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:22.800]   able to type CD backs dot back slash whatever they want to be able to get a file that can see be
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:27.520]   seen by one app and work with it with another app or manipulate it some way. I think this is a nice
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:33.040]   compromise between both of those ideals, the safety and security and simplicity of let the
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:38.080]   OS take care of the files for you and the power of yes, but I have a Microsoft Word file that
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:42.320]   and two different Microsoft Word compatible apps and one will not be able to see the other
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:47.200]   until I upload this to Dropbox and download it again, which is kind of silly. So yeah, it's a
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:52.240]   great step for the fact that there's API's for it is also a big one. So like like so many of the
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:56.800]   announcements that come up during WWDC, it's a nice demo and then you're like, oh, I can't wait
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:02.880]   until actually like 10 months from now to see how developers leverage this into something
[00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:07.120]   much, much better than the demo. Yeah. Yeah, it's the unification with all the third party
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:10.160]   storage providers like your Google Docs are in there, your OneDrive stuff is in there,
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:14.800]   your Dropbox stuff is in there. And it's sort of exactly what we wanted where it's a visualize
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:18.800]   layer like they're not muddling up your files, they're keeping all your files in their respective
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:23.360]   services and silos, but it's providing you with a unified view and a secure way of moving in between
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:27.680]   those services. Yeah, and there are a whole bunch of ways to smooth things out because we were
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:32.320]   we're only barely aware of how much malarkey we're putting ourselves through with those current
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:37.520]   system this morning. So I took my walk to a lunch place to get a sandwich and I set things up and
[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:43.680]   okay, well, I got to make sure that I catch up on my email and I couldn't get into my email until
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:52.640]   I updated my Dropbox password because the my mail app is linked to Dropbox for file transfers
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:58.320]   and I changed my Dropbox password. I'm like, really? And because the app had not been written
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:02.320]   very, very well, I can't just say, yeah, I'll deal with that later. Right now, I really want to
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:06.720]   check my email, like, no, I will not cheat. And that's the sort of stuff. It'll be completely
[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:10.640]   transparent to the app and transparent to the user. They'll just be a place where if you want to
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:14.960]   save a file, a file attachment, for instance, here is where it can go and it'll feel like you're
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:19.920]   just saving it on to a three and a half inch floppy. It's really interesting. We don't know the pain
[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:24.080]   that I speak of, but we use Drupal for iMore and for the last two years, we've been trying to use
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:27.840]   iPads with it and you press a button, you upload a file and it's just not as fast as the Mac.
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:30.960]   And now with drag and drop and files, you have files in one pane, Drupal and the other,
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:35.040]   drag the files across, suck some ball up. So, everybody's always went like wide and she just went,
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:41.200]   eee, yeah, especially when you see like this is the real like minority report stuff we were
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:45.600]   promised, not just like, hey, look, my finger is a mouse, I'm dragging this to this. It's like,
[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:50.000]   no, this, put more in the pile, put more in the pile, take more of this and drag into this. So,
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.520]   yeah, you immediately see if you're if you are a fan of the iPad, if you're this,
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:57.600]   if you're that weirdo who three years ago said, you know what, maybe I will, I'm going, I'm going
[00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:02.480]   to be in Europe for a week and visiting three different cities. Maybe I'll take just my iPad
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:07.440]   and not my MacBook. This is the sort of thing where you just say, I was right. I was right.
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:12.080]   Well, that's funny that you say that's exactly the question the conversation I'm having with myself.
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:16.320]   I almost just brought an iPad on this last vacation. I'm going vacation again.
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:21.280]   Only two a year. It seems like more. I know I'm going on vacation again in September and I'm doing
[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:27.120]   exactly that. We're doing a riverboat trip in France. And I think it feels so close
[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:30.640]   that I could probably do everything I want to do on the iPad.
[00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:38.480]   I think that with your iPad Pro and with if you're running at that point, either the shipping
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:43.680]   version of the next version of iOS or the really, really stable practically the gold master version
[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:50.080]   of it, I think it will be. Yeah, then I think you're pretty good. As usual, the only
[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:54.000]   the number of times I've been asked to answer this question over the past couple of weeks,
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.800]   it was such a great demo during WWDC. It really is getting a lot of people thinking,
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:02.800]   I was going to buy a MacBook. Should I buy an iPad instead or I've got an iPad and I haven't
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:06.720]   been really been using it. Maybe I should take it right back out of the closet.
[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:15.600]   If the still the only consistent Achilles heel is that you have to be able to within 90% accuracy
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:20.960]   predict what you're going to need your computer for. Because if I have my, I don't have an
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:27.440]   answer, but if I have my Raspberry Pi, it's in a case with an $80 little LCD screen.
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:32.720]   I can with that in my bag, I can do anything I ever need to do with a computer, any disaster
[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:37.840]   that happens or any unexpected opportunity, I can deal with it. With an iPad, you at some point
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:43.120]   might find out that I don't have a way to get this damn file off of this device and move it
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:49.520]   onto here or there is some piece of software that the iPad can't even pretend that it knows about.
[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:57.600]   But that's not for most uses. It really isn't a big deal. I mean, if anything,
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:03.440]   the situation has only gotten better. When I first started using an iPad as a notebook, so to speak,
[00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:09.520]   the only time I would travel with a MacBook is if I had a really complicated project,
[00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:14.000]   where I had to coordinate a lot of apps and a lot of people and a lot of data. Now,
[00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:20.560]   for instance, now that Scribner is another multi-file project apps are available in iOS versions,
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:26.160]   now again, it really has to be, is my deadline happening during this week? Yes, then I'll take
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:31.120]   the MacBook. Is my deadline happening a couple of weeks after this so that if I can only get
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:36.320]   75% done of what I think I need to get done, will it not be a disaster? No? Okay, then take the iPad.
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:43.440]   Well, I think the trick is going to be to at some point say, okay, I'm going to take a month and
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:48.960]   eschew a desktop operating system. It's really interesting. For a week, you'll be supporting
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:55.120]   it a week. It's really interesting to watch Apple address these particular issues. And I think
[00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:58.160]   it's really, I'm really glad it's Apple doing this because I think they're looking at it with
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:06.880]   very fresh eyes. How do we give desktop users what they want without making this iOS touch
[00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:13.200]   environment too complex, make it work with touch? So I'm really interested. And I haven't played
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:17.600]   with iOS 11. I presume you've installed it, Renee, right? Oh, yeah, totally. And there's one other
[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:20.880]   sort of mental difference that people might need to get through depends on your use case. Some people
[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:25.360]   will not notice this other people will notice it immediately is that iPad is still security first.
[00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:30.640]   So on a Mac, for example, as you drag any app you drag over is free to interact with the data,
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:34.560]   preview it can affect that it can change it on iOS. That is not the case. It will only,
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:39.040]   it will only handshake and release security on the data when you actively drop it when there's an
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:42.640]   explicit user interaction that you want to share with that app. So for example, if you have some
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:45.760]   contact app, you just download it and you're dragging someone's contact over it,
[00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:50.320]   it can't start sucking in all your contact information unless you specifically drop it in that app.
[00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:53.520]   Otherwise, if you go right over it into another app, it will never know what was in that. It'll
[00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:58.240]   get metadata, but not the actual data. And that will affect some people, some people who want to
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:02.320]   do things like previewing colors or textures or something. But I don't think it'll affect most people.
[00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:07.920]   Yeah. So you've got a doc that comes and goes a lot much like the Mac OS doc.
[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:13.840]   Yes. You've got drag and drop. Is it arbitrary between any two apps?
[00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:20.800]   Any apps that support each other? Yeah. Yeah. But it's protected in the sense you just described.
[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:23.920]   And it's true multi-touch. You can be holding these files with one hand,
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:28.240]   do the picture, the finger swipe, home screen, you can pull over, you can open up a little.
[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:33.120]   You can't even do that as well. It all on a Mac OS. No, it is completely 10 finger multi-touch
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:40.160]   aware with gesture support and everything. It's really clever. Hopefully, it won't lead to a world
[00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:44.960]   in which we're expected to keep moving our hands off of the fake keyboard and onto the screen.
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:48.320]   Or else we're going to have to rewind it to all the times when Apple has said,
[00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:52.880]   people don't want to operate a computer by stretching out their hands. It's completely unnatural.
[00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:57.040]   That's why we don't have multi-touch on the Mac. But really, it's not about it.
[00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:01.680]   You have to put it down too. Exactly. Or have it in an easel. That was my problem when I was testing
[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:07.440]   it out. I had to keep, "No, come back, iPad. Come back. I want to manipulate your files."
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:16.000]   It's not meant to be a primary way of interacting with the device.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:22.800]   But I think that it really is those times where I can't believe I'm doing this 18 times because I
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:28.640]   need to get this done. I will happily pull out the legs of my kickstand, flatten out my iPad to
[00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:32.320]   do spend 30 seconds doing this really administrative thing that otherwise would have been
[00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:36.720]   not only a few minutes more, but also just endlessly irritating when there's obviously
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:42.560]   an easier way to do it. Of course, there's also an issue of apps. There's professional-style apps
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:47.680]   on a desktop that have to come to the iPad Pro. Although I look at people like Adobe,
[00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:53.760]   they've put Lightroom on there. They're really clearly going to make Lightroom on iOS appear
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:59.680]   instead of an adjunct sidecard to Lightroom on the desktop. That affinity was amazing.
[00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:03.600]   Well, I've been playing with affinity. I have to say, there's things I can do in affinity that
[00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:08.480]   I can't do in Lightroom. It was interesting because they have a shared memory architecture on iOS.
[00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:13.840]   You don't have to sort of pre-determine if you're going to hit the CPU or the GPU. You can access
[00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:17.920]   that shared memory architecture. That's something that is not the same when you have an Intel
[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:21.920]   processor and then a discrete GPU that each have their own independent memory. They were saying
[00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:25.360]   that the affinity people were saying they can do some things on the iPad that they just can't do
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:30.440]   another other
[00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:32.000]   interesting devices. Affinity is $20, but it sounds like well worth it. Serenity was saying it's as
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.400]   good as Photoshop from her point of view. It's a mind-taking thing for me.
[00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:44.960]   It's a variety of apps. One of my favorite iOS apps a while ago, Graphic. When you have a
[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:50.560]   nap that's really been conceived as being attached to know one particular platform that's really
[00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:55.920]   focused on what people intend to do with it, it is such a wonderful app to use on the iPad
[00:17:55.920 --> 00:18:00.240]   and almost the same experience on the Mac, but you see all their little subtle changes to it.
[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:08.400]   It's the same thing with Adobe and Microsoft. Both need to get some sort of a special award
[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:13.040]   for how they take this. Something as complex as Microsoft Office and bring it to a mobile
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:18.000]   platform in such a way that you don't notice the features that you're missing, even though you're
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.800]   missing a lot of features in Office, because if you're using this on your iPad with your little
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:28.080]   fold-up keyboard in a coffee shop, you probably were not going to be rebuilding a table of content
[00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:34.160]   and re-changing all of your footnotes. You were probably just doing some edits or writing a new
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:39.200]   chapter or looking at the changes someone else made to a document that you're sharing. It's the
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:44.880]   same thing with Lightroom, which is for, I'd say, 85 to 90 percent of the stuff that I use Lightroom
[00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:49.920]   for, and I'm very, very persnickety. I can probably get that stuff done on the iPad Pro. If it weren't
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:56.080]   for the lack of storage or the speed of Wi-Fi internet at the coffee shops and hotels I usually
[00:18:56.080 --> 00:19:02.480]   work at. Don't let that throw you off. If there is not a one-to-one, if your issue is,
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:09.520]   I can't run Photoshop on my iPad, Adobe already has something that's better suited for the iPad,
[00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:13.680]   or maybe there is a different app that's very compatible with Photoshop that will let you do
[00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:17.280]   everything you want to do and maybe even do it faster. So this really is a time where
[00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:24.240]   I can't stress this enough. This is such a transformative year, 2017, for any Apple fan,
[00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:30.000]   where if you're a Mac user, it's time to think about not because of anything that's going on on
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.320]   the Mac side of things, but you may not be aware of how much advancements have been made in the
[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:38.960]   iPad since the last time two years ago when your cousin came over and stayed three or four days,
[00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:43.280]   which was the last time you spent any long amount of time watching someone use an iPad.
[00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:46.880]   Ditto for Windows. If you haven't used Windows in a while, you don't know what it's like because
[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:51.680]   you haven't seen it in a few years. But specifically about the iPad, it really is a highly credible
[00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:56.400]   machine. You're not a freak for deciding that maybe my next laptop should not be a MacBook Air.
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:20:01.360]   Maybe it should be an iPad and a keyboard. There's so much to talk about that's happened.
[00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:05.920]   And I apologize if people say, well, we talked about this two weeks ago, but we didn't get the
[00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:10.800]   iPad. We didn't get the iPad. At least, I'm sure Renee, you had a review yet, but Annie and I just
[00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:15.440]   got ours on what Thursday or Friday. So we've had a chance to play with it.
[00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:21.360]   I'm doing stuff. This is affinity photo. I can do stuff in here that I really couldn't do in
[00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:27.040]   Lightroom, including a fix, kind of poor focus on a shot that I really liked, but it was kind of
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:33.040]   just a little bit, but using some of their filters. You notice how fast it is, by the way.
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:39.360]   And that's one of the things is really important for me with working with photos, large raw images.
[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:42.400]   Now, can I work with raw images on that? That might be one issue.
[00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:48.960]   I have a Lightroom will work with raw photos. A lot of photos will work with raw. I don't know
[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:53.280]   about affinity only because I haven't tried it yet, but I'd be surprised if it knows that it
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:56.880]   really is pitching it as a professional level app. So I'd be surprised if it has to.
[00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:03.440]   Yeah. How would I get those in there? I presume this is finally, this lightning port,
[00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:09.360]   finally is high speed, right? USB 3. With the adapter. You need one of the USB.
[00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:11.680]   But you need to get the adapter because I have the old adapter.
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:15.280]   So I need to get the new adapter. If you had the one for the previous 12.9 inch, it's the same one.
[00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:22.640]   Okay. So unlike the previous 9.7 inch Mac, iOS Pro, what it is called, an iPad.
[00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:27.280]   This one is high speed port. So I could put a card reader.
[00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:31.280]   The card reader is high speed as well. The only thing we complained about this last week,
[00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:34.880]   but I'm still irked by it, is that the cable isn't. You have to get the adapter.
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:39.760]   The USB C to lightning cable, it doesn't get the 3.0, which I think just hopefully gets fixed as
[00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:44.320]   fast as humanly as fast as corporately possible. It's, I mean, Apple really, you know, in fact,
[00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:49.440]   Adam Anks wrote an article that I think annoyed a lot of people in tidbits saying,
[00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:55.760]   "This is it. This is the beginning of the end of Mac OS and the desktop. This is the move,
[00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:59.920]   which we've all expected. Am I misinterpreting him to?
[00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:03.200]   I just look outside and I still see trucks. You know, so I'm not worried about it.
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:04.720]   Well, yeah, but...
[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:11.360]   I won't repeat that. I won't go into the long repeat of what I've been saying for a couple of
[00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:17.840]   weeks, but I will say that once again, it seemed as though during WWDC, which is a gold-plated
[00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:24.400]   opportunity for Apple to give the Mac community that patent, patent standing in front of the big
[00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:29.440]   flag of the United States of America speech that big, "We will win. This is a great thing.
[00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:32.400]   We'll love, love, love the Mac. We're going to show you how much we love the Mac."
[00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:37.040]   And most of their statements were, "Look at this new feature we're adding to the Mail app."
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:42.000]   And look how, look on our great new iMac Pro. It is going to be the greatest Mac ever for
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:47.280]   writing iOS apps on. We haven't, if I would love, I don't believe that Apple has given up on Mac,
[00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:50.800]   but I don't believe they're showing us any signs that they are excited about the Mac.
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:51.680]   That's all I'm saying.
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:57.600]   Well, you know, from a purely business point of view, iOS would, if you could make iOS as capable
[00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:00.880]   as a desktop computer, that would be the way to go.
[00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:04.160]   And we'll talk a little bit about the Mac Pro.
[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:07.120]   The $5,000 Mac Pro and iMac Pro in a bit.
[00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:12.080]   There's a great story about when Snow Leopard came out where they went to Steve and they're like,
[00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:15.680]   "How do we sell this?" And I forget the gentleman's name, but he was a Safari marketing manager.
[00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:19.520]   And he goes, "We go with no new features. That's what we do. We say it's not leopard,
[00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:23.280]   it's no new features." And they're like, "That's great." Because really, it had like exchange and a
[00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:27.120]   few other things in Grand Central Dispatch. But saying no new features was way better than saying
[00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:29.440]   a couple. And I think this year-- A couple of selfie features, right.
[00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:32.480]   No, but this year is the same thing. Like they've recently had a huge rework.
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:36.480]   The entire software organization is different. And it's going to take them, I think, a good year
[00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:41.120]   to bring all the stuff. The same thing to work when they unify it. I work as I was saying
[00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:45.040]   codebase. It's going to take them a year to get everything to get mail, to get Safari,
[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:50.480]   to get everything on that unified base. And it's easier with iOS because a lot of it came from,
[00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:54.560]   a lot of the logic and the new material came from iOS. So getting the Mac all ramped up on the
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:57.840]   engine is going to take a while. So instead of just saying, "Hey, look, growing pains," they come
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:01.280]   out and they say, "We're doing a slow leopard and we've got all these great new core technologies
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:04.480]   for you." And a few little tweaks over here. And every once in a while, we like to do the,
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:08.880]   what Syracuse that calls cat metaphor, cat. And everyone is happy. And then Apple has a time to
[00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:12.960]   sort of get that new initiative underway. I'll get more worried when we start seeing things like
[00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:16.160]   Xcode appear on iOS because then Apple engineers can start shifting on that.
[00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:22.000]   I think that's around the corner. I really do. I mean, people are using Pythonista and other apps
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.800]   to develop apps now on iPad. But the compile times won't be great unless they're just like
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:32.080]   client. Like client. I don't know. I'll just say this processor, somebody who was saying in the
[00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:38.640]   chat, "Geek benches as fast as the 13 inch MacBook Pro." Right? It's like a broad,
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:42.640]   well, it's really, really good, but it's not multi-multicore. Throw everything at your compiler.
[00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:49.600]   Good. Yeah. Also, it's a difference between a processor that's, overall system is good at
[00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:56.720]   really fast for the operating system versus really fast for you having an idea of what you want to
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:01.280]   get done and getting it done real quick. And so there are some problems with the form factor of
[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:06.560]   a tablet. That's, that's, I don't necessarily think that that's the end of the road.
[00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:13.440]   I'll say is that anytime you spend, I have a number in my head that I recalculate from time to
[00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:17.600]   time when I do my finances that this is the amount of money that I can spend on something and not
[00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:21.920]   care about that amount of money. And if it's less than that amount of money, I'll just buy it and
[00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:26.080]   I won't care about it. It's about, it's about the cost of two burritos. I don't know. But for a thousand,
[00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:29.920]   suffice to say that the price of a new laptop, no matter who makes it, is well above that. So,
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:35.040]   I'm just saying that anytime in the next year, if Apple has not come out of the gate with here is
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:39.120]   really something that really, if Apple has not said or released something about the Mac that gets
[00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:43.840]   you really excited about your Mac, you owe it to that thousand dollars, fifteen hundred dollars,
[00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:49.280]   two thousand dollars to take a hard look at the Macad Pro. Not too much. And a hard look at a
[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:53.360]   Windows machine because that's a lot of money. And they can't, I do believe that Apple's been
[00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:59.520]   trading on our faith in the Mac for the past two years at least. And that should end in 2017.
[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:04.640]   They have to earn your next purchase, absolutely. Well, maybe the next purchase is an iPad. I'm
[00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:09.040]   looking at benchmarks. This is Geekbench 4. Yeah. You know, I'm going to say right now,
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:13.280]   the problem with benchmarks in general, especially Geekbenches, it's, you know, it's synthetic.
[00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:23.520]   But if you look at this score alone, the iPad Pro comes very close to, it beats last year's 13
[00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:31.120]   inch and comes very close to matching this year's 13 inch close enough to make up for the two
[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:37.200]   thousand dollar difference, I would say. There's a consistent thing I love about all like iPhones
[00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:40.880]   and iPads. I will look, I will look at the hardware and the benchmarks and I'll think to myself,
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:44.960]   this looks suspiciously overpowered for the features it has right now.
[00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:52.160]   So, so even if, even if it means like iOS 12 or iOS 13 before even starts to make that
[00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:56.960]   iPad sweat a little bit, boy, it's great to have to know that there are at least eight cylinders
[00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:59.840]   inside that car that you're not even touching during your grocery run.
[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:06.480]   Well, furthermore, if you're happy with the speed of the Mac book, you'd be happier with my
[00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:11.600]   pet bro. The interesting thing is like the iPhone 7, you can peg the A10 and iPhone 7
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:15.120]   using portrait mode and using some advanced photo features for you paint with that, like
[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:19.520]   think paint with deformation masks. You can do that. The A10X, I had a chance to talk to James
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:24.240]   Kuda procreate and he was saying that's not just the A10X, it's also metal too. And it's like metal
[00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:29.280]   too, I think alone is giving him four X in performance over open DLA 2X for the original
[00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:33.200]   2X for metal too. And the metal two marks for the iPad Pro also.
[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:43.520]   Look at the metal scores. All the iPad pros from this year and this year are beating the
[00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:47.360]   MacBook Pros. I mean, this is designed silicon. This is incredible.
[00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:55.600]   And I only bring this up. Look, there's a real reason I have a desktop computing system and
[00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:59.760]   there's a real reason I have a desktop operating system. And I don't think it's either or,
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:05.680]   but I think Apple's making a better and better case for leaving behind for many people leaving
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:12.080]   behind the laptop and bringing an iPad. There are a lot of variables for a lot of people.
[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:18.320]   It's going to be, I don't care how fast the CPU is, I can lift the lid of this and be typing
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:23.440]   in 10 seconds on my iPad. I have to take this out of the case. I have to take my keyboard out of
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:27.200]   the case. I have to turn on, I have to react, make sure they find each other via Bluetooth.
[00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:31.360]   Or even if I have a smart case, I have to make sure both things are working. There are a lot
[00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:35.360]   of convenience features. That's why one of the best features of any Apple product is
[00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:40.800]   two-week return policy. We don't care what the reason is. As long as you took really good care
[00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:45.120]   of it and you return it with everything that we sold it with, you can say that I'm still upset
[00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:49.840]   about the death of Tori Donahue. He said, "Okay, there you go. Here's your money back. All $3,000 of it."
[00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:52.720]   I hope Tori don't have to bring a camera with you more.
[00:28:52.720 --> 00:29:01.200]   Why? Because the iPhone 7 cameras in here. Which is pretty funny. I've complained for
[00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:06.240]   years that why would they not put a better camera in the iPad? Well, now they're matched. It doesn't
[00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:13.440]   have the two sensors, but I've found the camera very good. Well, it's weird. That's great.
[00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:18.240]   But that's what's nice is you have the biggest view I've ever seen, especially from macros.
[00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:21.680]   I still hope I don't see a lot of people taking pictures of their tablets, but
[00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:24.960]   you know what? I've grown accustomed to the fact that people do. A lot of people.
[00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:31.200]   I've learned not to judge. And also, so many of these features, in the context of finding out
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:36.400]   how big Apple is pushing into AR, now you start to reevaluate, go back to your notes
[00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:42.080]   again saying, "Okay, so they've added a new super high frame rate to the iPad. They also have the
[00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:48.480]   CPU that is wicked, wicked faster than I need to compose email on. And now there's a camera that
[00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:55.200]   is way, way better than common judgment has ever decided that a camera needs to be."
[00:29:55.200 --> 00:30:00.720]   And it's like, "Oh, this fall is going to be a lot of fun." Yeah. Well, we'll take a break.
[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:05.920]   We're going to fix Renee's audio. We'll call you back in a second. It's breaking up for some reason.
[00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:13.280]   But when we come back, let's talk about that. Also, not to deprecate the new
[00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:20.480]   high Sierra, which sounds a little bit like Snow Leopard. But in fact, I think the one feature
[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:26.480]   alone is a massive change. A massive change. We'll talk about that. I was wondering, and now
[00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:30.960]   there's some clarity, Andrew Cunningham writing in AR's Technica about something that's going
[00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:38.320]   to happen to you and me and everyone else this fall with the new Mac OS. And I didn't watch the
[00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:46.080]   keynote, so I didn't get the reality distortion field. But really, a $5,000 iMac Pro? Oh, it can
[00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:52.240]   go way higher than $5,000. Yeah. We'll talk about that. You want to sell your car? Really?
[00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:56.080]   Really? Is that what pros really want? I think it tops out at 17, isn't it? What?
[00:30:56.080 --> 00:31:01.840]   I think so. BMW will sell you a sports car, but you really want the one with all the letters
[00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:07.680]   after it. Like 18 cores and 128 megabytes and two terabytes of solid state.
[00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:16.960]   But it's an iMac. Boy, is it ever? It's an iMac. All right. Well, it's not available to
[00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:22.160]   you. So I can have some time to save up. We're going to take a break. Come back with more.
[00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:29.360]   Renee Richie, I'm more.com. Andy Naco from the Chicago Sun Times and a brand new tracker.
[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:34.240]   The tracker pixel. It is. I just got the tracker pixel. This is exciting.
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:39.440]   Tracker, a coin size tracking device, make sure you don't lose a thing. I didn't lose my luggage.
[00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:44.160]   I didn't lose my keys. Then lose my wallet. I didn't lose remotes. Don't.
[00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:50.160]   How much time do you spend looking for stuff you've misplaced in life? A lot.
[00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:57.520]   A lot. Eight years ago, Tracker changed everything when they released the first Bluetooth tracking
[00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:03.120]   device. They're doing it again. The new tracker pixel. Oh, look. They have a fourth of July special
[00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:08.080]   collectors edition. That's cool with a high heart of America and America flag on it. Actually,
[00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:11.280]   it's one of the neat things about the tracker. There's tiny. They're about the size of a quarter,
[00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:14.960]   lighter than a quarter because it's anodized aluminum. It does have a replaceable battery.
[00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:18.880]   Great battery life because you just Bluetooth L.E. and you can print and engrave them, which is
[00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:23.920]   really cool. So you can really customize your tracker. It's the lightest Bluetooth tracking
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:28.720]   device on the market. Pair it with your smartphone. In fact, you compare it with multiple smartphones
[00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:34.240]   and every phone can pair up to 10 different trackers. You attach it to your keys. You attach it to your
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:38.560]   bike. Whatever it is, you don't want to lose. The new tracker pixel is awesome because how many
[00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:44.800]   times have you left something under a couch or has fallen under a couch? The tracker pixel lights
[00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:52.400]   up with bright pixels so you can see it. It can be making noise. Your phone has a map. It's going
[00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:56.800]   to be less time looking for your stuff than ever before. One of the things I love about the tracker,
[00:32:56.800 --> 00:33:04.400]   T-R-A-C-K-R, by the way. One of the things I love about the tracker is this crowd GPS network.
[00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:08.880]   There's nobody doing this partly because tracker in eight years is still more than a
[00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:13.280]   four and a half million trackers. There's a ton of them out there. So that means anybody who's
[00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:17.840]   running the tracker software on their phone, and that's lots of people, when they walk by your
[00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:23.680]   device, your tracker, they'll ping you. They'll say, "Hey, I just saw your device." So your map doesn't just
[00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:29.120]   show where you left your phone. It shows anywhere or your keys or anything else anywhere it could be.
[00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:35.600]   The tracker.com, use the offer code MAC BREAK because we've got a special deal 20% off any order
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:41.680]   and look at that great 4th of July edition. I'll tell you what, I love having the tracker because I
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:48.560]   did not lose anything on this trip. Thank you, tracker. T-H-E-T-R-A-C-K-R.com, use the promo code MAC

[00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:59.200]   put the tracker on it. I'll tell you, it's a great thing. And we thank you so much for making
[00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:07.840]   Mac BREAK weekly possible. I'm excited about APFS. One of the questions I had, the Apple,
[00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:11.920]   the new Apple file system. One of the questions I had, which I think we even talked about before
[00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:19.840]   I left, was even though Apple kind of surreptitiously snuck this in on iOS 10, would they do the same
[00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:25.760]   when it was ready for Mac OS? And now, according to Andrew Cunningham, we know the answer, yes.
[00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:36.320]   The new file system, when you install the new Hi-C era, it will convert your boot drive to APFS
[00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:43.360]   regardless of whether they have an SSD, a spinning drive, a fusion drive. Now, he says,
[00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:47.920]   in the current beta installer, you have an option to uncheck the box, but it is checked by default.
[00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:54.400]   And it's presumed, I think it's safe to presume Apple will do some compatibility checking and so
[00:34:54.400 --> 00:35:01.680]   forth. What happened? There we go. But my screen went black. But I think this is very good news.
[00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:08.800]   We've been using a file system that's 20 years old, HFS+, it won't go away. Apple says HFS+
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:14.640]   is going to continue for compatibility. Hi-C era will be able to boot from HFS+ partitions.
[00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:23.360]   Disk utility will retain the ability to format, drives either HFS or APFS, along with the other
[00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:29.920]   formats it supports. Are you also doing the beta, Renee?
[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:34.160]   Yeah, so there's a couple things that are really, really clever. First, I don't know if you had a
[00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:39.440]   chance to see it, but Craig Federiki, when he was on the talk show, he revealed that in iOS 10.1,
[00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:44.880]   they did virtual conversion, checked it for errors, rolled it back, sent the data,
[00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:48.640]   iOS 10.2 did the same thing again. And then that means that they sorted out all the problems
[00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:56.640]   before they committed in iOS 10.3. And that's a really clever, so cool sneaky model to doing this.
[00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:59.520]   And now they have a much bigger problem because like you said, there's fusion drives to support.
[00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:02.640]   There's external drives to support. There's a whole bunch of features that make a lot of sense
[00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:08.080]   on a Mac that are beyond the scope of what an iOS device does. And they're doing the same thing
[00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:11.680]   when the beta gets installed. I think mine actually asked me if I wanted it or not. I don't remember
[00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:16.800]   whether the checkbox. I think it was a request year. But either way, I went all in. And it was,
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:20.640]   I barely noticed it took a couple minutes and I was up and running. They do say that if you have
[00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:26.800]   external drives, there's no real reason to-- It's super fast. If you have external drives, there's
[00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:30.400]   no real reason you can convert them if you want to. But just out of a data integrity standpoint,
[00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:35.680]   I wouldn't do it unless you need to. But I've had absolutely no problems with it and it's really great.
[00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:43.120]   Yeah, it's about time. And of course, now that we're almost exclusively using SSDs,
[00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:49.200]   it's much needed. And you get so many other benefits, like just the cloning and the snapshot
[00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:53.920]   in. And it'll work with all the Apple systems, just like Time Machine is being updated forward
[00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:57.920]   and all the key plumbing. Well, that's good because Time Machine was always a
[00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:01.920]   cluge and this will now be really a real way to snapshot and diversioning.
[00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:04.320]   And wireless Time Machine, I mean, is a massive thing again.
[00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:08.560]   Yeah, wow. This is really exciting. See, to me, maybe I'm a wonk or whatever.
[00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:14.880]   Admittedly, High Sierra is another one of those releases where there's no big visible changes.
[00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:19.680]   But that, this is a massive change. And it will affect everybody.
[00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:27.680]   Yeah, it really is like, yeah, it's fundamental. It's architectural, which means that suddenly,
[00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:32.160]   everything is faster, everything is better, everything is a little reliable, but you don't know
[00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:37.920]   why that is. For instance, where it has been optimized for SSDs, has been optimized for
[00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:42.640]   security and backup, just like Renee was saying. But things like, let's make sure that when someone
[00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:48.320]   launches an app, that data, that first flusher data hits so quickly, you don't even see a pause.
[00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:52.640]   When you try to open a file or open a large movie file, it will cut down the amount of time it'll
[00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:58.720]   take just for that first wash of bits to be handled by the app and to be put on your screen.
[00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:02.080]   So everything is going to see, even if you're running it on an older machine,
[00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:06.720]   your older machine will seem so much faster because you are never aware of how many
[00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:09.600]   file system bottlenecks that you were dealing with with the old file system.
[00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:16.560]   This is remember, this is this is water going through lead pipes with lead and iron pipes.
[00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:21.360]   And it's been cleaned because you don't know how much waste and sewage treatment has happened
[00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:26.400]   at every junction to make it safe to drink. And now they decided to rip out all of your pipes
[00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:31.360]   in the entire community and finally give you a modern water system. And you're like, oh, wow,
[00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:35.600]   it doesn't taste a little bit like carrots when I drink right out of the tap anymore. I wonder
[00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:40.000]   why that was. We no longer we don't. I will not extend the analogy.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:46.080]   Sometimes I have a hard time following you somehow we got to carrots and that's when I kind of
[00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:48.880]   lost you. So good. That's when I hit the that's when I hit the aborts.
[00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:53.760]   What I'm going for is that what I'm going for is that everyone will make everything better.
[00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:58.080]   You don't need to understand why it's better. There is not a whole lot of downsides to it.
[00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:03.600]   The only open questions that I've been navigating is what happens when things go wrong because
[00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:08.320]   people who the people in software that are really, really good at recovering hard drives and
[00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:14.560]   recovering backups are super, super good at seeing what what the old file system could do to a file
[00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:19.760]   and figuring out how to fix it. It's going to be a lot of people, very smart people starting off
[00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:25.200]   with a lot of experience with this file system. So I don't know if it's going to be as easy to
[00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:30.400]   recover a damaged drive, whether it's a physically or logically damaged drive. But you got to move
[00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:33.840]   forward. It's safe enough to put into play. So let's start the process.
[00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:37.200]   There's a mindset difference to remember, especially on something like the Mac where
[00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:40.720]   you're doing clones. So previously, you might have had a photo of Andy and you went copy, copy,
[00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:44.240]   copy, copy, copy, copy and duplicated it four times. Then you run out of space and you figure,
[00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:47.840]   well, I'll delete three of the duplicates and I'll get the space back. But now they're just clones.
[00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:50.880]   You can start deleting those duplicates and it's not really going to change the amount of space
[00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:55.280]   you have on your drive. So Apple's doing a bunch of stuff to sort of make the way it shows data
[00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:59.840]   more intuitive. But for some people who are used to monitoring everything, the bit level is going
[00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:05.680]   to take a little bit of getting used to. Yeah. Like I said, suddenly I've got 800 gigabytes
[00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:10.160]   of free space on my drive. I didn't have before. Like after starting for the new Mac, it's probably
[00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:14.800]   because you did not know how many times you had multiple copies of something that you keep moving
[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:19.440]   from moving in from Dropbox or people keep sharing to you from someplace else. People notice that
[00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:24.960]   on iOS, didn't they? It's like, yes, all those gifts. Suddenly you had gigabytes lit back. Yeah.
[00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:32.320]   No, super, super cool technology. And it's going to be interesting to see how they roll it out. But
[00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:34.880]   I think they're, I think they're going to make people a choice initially. And if you're a little
[00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:39.840]   bit reticent, just wait, wait, let people hit me in Leo. Take those initial punches. And then
[00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:43.600]   when you're happy to do the conversion, somebody's asking the chairman, will you still be able to
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:49.120]   read NTFS and XFAT and FAF32? You still be able to read all those stuff.
[00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:53.440]   Yeah. Everything should be backward compatible. Apple's priority here is to make sure that you
[00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:58.160]   don't even notice they did anything at all. They will, they don't even necessarily want you to
[00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:03.360]   they don't want you to ever say, thank God for APFS. Yeah. Don't say my God, my computer so much
[00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:08.880]   faster now or my God, I have so much storage, but they don't ever want you to identify APFS as the
[00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:13.040]   hero or the villain of anything. So if you were looking for data points, it said Apple's still
[00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:22.400]   committed to the Mac OS. This would be one. I mean, let's again, let's, that's the, that's the
[00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:27.040]   Paul McCartney line. The John Lennon response line is, Oh, good. They decided that they no longer
[00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:31.280]   want to support a special operating system just for the Mac. They want the Mac to use the IIOS.
[00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:36.560]   But that points out to another advantage of APFS. If you have the same operating system
[00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:42.560]   on every device, not just for files, the same security system platform on all devices,
[00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:47.360]   it will make so many things that again, if you had any idea how much trouble a developer is going
[00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:53.680]   through to make to make a highly dysfunctional file system look normal, all that goes away right
[00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:59.280]   now. And suddenly it behaves nicely across devices without anything behind the scenes going,
[00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:04.000]   going nuts for your behalf. So those were the, you know, I would the 10 point, the new Mac iPad Pro
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.800]   was very excited about. I did not get to, as I said, watch the keynote. I was just like reading
[00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:12.880]   with poor internet bits and pieces. Got excited about that, ordered that right away with the new
[00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:17.680]   keyboard. Got pretty excited about the high Sierra. We were, you know, saying what are they going to
[00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:22.320]   call it? But high Sierra makes sense. This is like snow, leopard, holy bake mountain lion. It's,
[00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:29.760]   you know, and that's going to come out in the fall, right? With iOS 11. Yes. And then I got to the
[00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:37.600]   iMac Pro. And I went, what the what? But I, but I again, I'm just reading like headlines.
[00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:43.760]   So the headline for me is, okay, well, we still haven't got a Mac Pro replacement. That's,
[00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:48.480]   you know, a year out or whatever. That's next year. But we thought you would like this
[00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:58.240]   Pro's and iMac that, you know, has no limits. It has the latest Intel processors that go up to
[00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:03.840]   18 cores. They call it Zions are. Yeah, there's a on. Okay, because Intel had some weird
[00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:14.960]   X core I nine. Yeah. Yeah. But it's the I nine. It's okay. Okay. Turbo boost. Okay. 42
[00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:20.640]   meg's. That's all that's all Intel and there'll be a lot of PCs. There'll be a lot of PCs with
[00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:28.480]   these. But these are that's workstation or server category processors. What else? Why
[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:36.160]   why else am I paying five starting at $5,000 on this thing? Huge, huge ram, a huge amount of ram
[00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:40.560]   you can put in it. A huge amount of SSD and it's really, it's really, it's still the five,
[00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:44.880]   it's still the five k retina, right? Yeah, it's the new five k retina panel, which is very,
[00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:48.080]   very similar to a slightly different panel. It does 10 bits to the T con, which then
[00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:52.160]   okay, there's some so you get billions of colors on the panel. So okay, but that's not that's a very
[00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:57.760]   nice. I like my 5k. I'm act is for people who want that panel, but also want a workstation,
[00:43:57.760 --> 00:44:04.880]   basically, and you can get 128 gigs. Yeah, but unlike a workstation, you can't up you can't open
[00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:09.680]   it up and put something else in right? No, it's you're buying this and using it for five, whatever,
[00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:16.240]   number of you vague. Well, but may are you with the Vega? I mean, this is right, Radeon Vega. I
[00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:21.680]   don't know anything about the Radeon Vega Pro 56 graphics processing unit, but that's great.
[00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:25.760]   If you don't want to court, I'm guessing it's not going to be something that you know,
[00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:30.320]   Alex Lindsay's going to be jumping up and down over. Oh, you never know realize that GP,
[00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:34.640]   GP was not just for graphics professionals. It's also for like AI professionals and people who just
[00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:41.200]   need abstract arbitrary experimental fastness. So I'm looking at, I just, I mean, okay, $5,000.
[00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:49.920]   Mostly it's that processor and the chance to go to 128 gigs of memory, which no one needs,
[00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:53.520]   but maybe you know it that you need it because you're designing rocket ships or something.
[00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:58.240]   You got core ML now, Leo. You'll be building up the future. I think if you're working on,
[00:44:58.240 --> 00:45:01.760]   well, okay, if you're working on Apple stuff, of course, but I mean, most people, you know,
[00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:05.200]   if you're using TensorFlow or whatever, you're not going to buy an iMac Pro.
[00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:12.240]   Did they mention the Mac Pro at all? It was sort of mentioned before the show that they weren't
[00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:15.840]   going to be discussing the Mac Pro at WBC. That's a next year story.
[00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:20.240]   And that'll be the modular computer that for people who really want to be able to change things
[00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:24.160]   and mess around with things, they'll have that option. Yeah, so hard for me to do.
[00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:26.960]   And the Mac Pro, iMac Pro won't be available till December.
[00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:30.960]   Does that mean if they ship five, they have to ship five by December 31st, I think is my
[00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:37.520]   understanding of the Mac Pro announcement that trash can Mac because they just pre-announced
[00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:42.480]   that way. Nothing about Phil's ass, but yes, it was. Yes. But you know, the fun,
[00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:47.280]   the that was one of the most fun parts of the entire keynote because it's like they went to a
[00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:52.640]   lot of trouble to really make sure that in the cutaway view and look how big the fans are.
[00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:58.400]   Look what the airflow of active fan propelled coolness is like through this thing. As I have
[00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:03.280]   to say, yes, we realized that passive airflow is not a good idea. We're indeed right about that.
[00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:07.440]   Don't worry about it. This one has electrically powered turning spinning propellers that will
[00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:13.040]   push air forcibly through this machine, just dust around your desk. Will it hover? Will it hover?
[00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:18.880]   Yes, my question. So have you guys assessed that there is a market for this particular?
[00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:21.200]   There were a lot of people that dubbed up who were like, you weren't allowed to touch it.
[00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:24.960]   You can only look at it and they had very serious looking gentlemen on either side of it to ensure
[00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:30.720]   that. But it had a lot of interest, mostly from people who have been using iMacs and Leo of Mac Pro's
[00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:35.120]   and who just seriously do want an all-in-one but just want it more powerful. What the
[00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:39.040]   apples mentioned that their mix for these pro machines isn't high. People buy mostly Macbooks
[00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:44.400]   by a huge margin. But of the people who is that small percentage who want pro machines, there is
[00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:49.760]   part of that market who wants the all-in-one. It's really tricky to make a pro level desktop
[00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:54.960]   machine because once the more expensive it gets, the more powerful it gets. Now you're talking about
[00:46:54.960 --> 00:47:03.120]   specific uses that are so that are completely unique to each purchaser. And so in the time since
[00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:07.840]   it was announced, I've talked to a lot of people who don't bat an eye at spending $5, $6, $7,000,
[00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:14.160]   $10,000 on a desktop machine. But they're like, I'm buying an $8,000 machine because this has to
[00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:22.480]   suit me perfectly. And I've heard from great many people that are still waiting for the desktop
[00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:27.360]   Mac Pro because their reaction is so what I didn't ask for a really super powerful iMac.
[00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:32.160]   I need a desktop machine with so I can open up and put things in and take them out so that in
[00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:37.280]   two years time, I'm not trying to sell this to buy the new piece of hardware that I could
[00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:41.600]   actually have the thing I want. And I want to be able to have this on my desktop for three or four
[00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:46.800]   years. And when one business or one client or one contract requires me to have this thing
[00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:52.240]   upgraded for a certain task, I can do that. So by all means, this is a really anything with a pro
[00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:57.280]   level on it. It's a hard, hard thing to design. It's especially hard if you are only going to be
[00:47:57.280 --> 00:48:03.840]   designing one example of these things. Apple's designing two pro Mac desktop. So hopefully,
[00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:08.000]   whoever is not terribly excited about the iMac Pro is going to be really excited about what Apple
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:13.200]   shows them next year. Assuming that it has right angles on the box and something that people
[00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:16.880]   off to reveal the inside of the box, I don't think that Apple will go half wrong.
[00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:18.880]   Or rack mounted. You can't rack mount this iMac.
[00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:23.120]   Emric is pointing out that there are that is upgradable to the extent that you can upgrade
[00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:27.440]   the RAM and that the CPU is a plugin CPU, which means you could perhaps
[00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:32.000]   plug in a bigger, faster CPU. Here's the tear.
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:33.920]   Get your suction cups? Yeah.
[00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:37.760]   Yeah, you don't really trust me. You don't want to open those, but you can.
[00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:48.080]   We've done it. So, and somebody else is saying like a tort, a loha, who is a photographer,
[00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:51.680]   a pro photographer said this is something pro photographers will want. That's true that that
[00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:56.800]   screen is great. And I get that. This is our chatroom on screen if you're watching the video.
[00:48:56.800 --> 00:49:04.400]   I get that because even on my current 5k iMac, I can't quite go as fast as I'd like going through
[00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:10.880]   photos. I'd love to be able to just go through. I watched Lisa on using photos and smaller files
[00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:14.400]   because she's using a micro four thirds camera. Just go boom, boom, boom, boom, as she reviews
[00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:18.160]   her photos and picks them. I have to wait loading. Okay. Wait loading.
[00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:22.400]   Yeah. Okay. And that's kind of important. H.265. So video professionals will be able to get through,
[00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:27.680]   you know, their editing tasks HDR 4K video faster. Are the hard drives faster still NVMe, right?
[00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:31.200]   I believe so. Some models got faster.
[00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:35.440]   Okay. Okay. That would make a difference.
[00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:42.480]   I just, I feel like pros might upgrade a bill. Want more upgradability.
[00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:46.880]   Don't care so much about the form factor. I guess if you're an artist, if you're a photographer,
[00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:51.120]   an artist, that then maybe how it looks is important to you, especially for the studio setting,
[00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:56.240]   you want to show it to clients. But I think, you know, a lot of people just want a big
[00:49:56.240 --> 00:49:59.920]   punk and work or something like that. The open concept startup,
[00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:04.240]   that's one of these on every desk. So when you see these walk in, look how we're spending your
[00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:09.520]   money. Yeah. That's what the CEO is going to want. So what's the top? That's what this is going to be
[00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:13.520]   the number one, the number one desktop for CEOs to read their inbox on.
[00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:16.320]   Yeah. I have AI, Mac Pro. What do you have?
[00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:21.760]   I can't. Renee can probably vouch for this that we, how many times have we seen this happen?
[00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:25.760]   We're given a tour of like an office where a lot of people are doing really fast things.
[00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:30.880]   And you see, oh, I'm surprised that that this whole team of developers as using company laptops
[00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:35.040]   that still has like a DVD drive inside it. And then you're into the CEO's office and yep,
[00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:39.840]   of course they've got the water cooled, you know, Craig, 53,000 computer.
[00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:46.960]   It's like, I'm guessing that you're not modeling, doing new weather models of tornadoes on this
[00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:50.960]   thing. So I'm guessing you're using it just to get instant messages from that person sitting just
[00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:54.160]   outside the door to tell you that your next meeting is coming up. Thunderbolt three is nice.
[00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:58.000]   This is the first time Mac with Thunderbolt three. That's going to make it. And it kept the legacy
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:02.240]   boards. I kept the old board. I still have a, you have a card reader, which I don't think any
[00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:07.440]   my Mac has had the other one. I'm not. That's what we've been there. Oh, it has. You just haven't,
[00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:12.480]   you just have never used them for a look at it. The whole damn thing. My back has an SD card reader.
[00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:16.800]   Yep. Almost certainly. Oh, and a headphone jack. I'm a, I'm a little surprised that doesn't,
[00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:21.920]   did they say, we're not going to get any information about this. Is it possible to remove the stand
[00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:25.280]   and put it in his amount? That was a complaint that a lot of people have been throwing my way that
[00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:30.800]   I can't, I have everything arms. Yeah. They didn't say, but previously you could buy the views amount
[00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:35.920]   as a secondary option when it was on sale. I'm assuming this will be the same because it's the
[00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:42.240]   same chassis, but. And it's space gray. Yeah. I had to do something to get make us angry for
[00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:45.840]   an A. So I bet they did that just out of place. All right. Fine. We'll give you an ethernet
[00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:51.360]   port under $10,000 precious computer. Pro apps are black. Let's just, how do we know with it?
[00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:55.280]   There's no price or no configuration. How do you know how much it's going to cost? I think I forget
[00:51:55.280 --> 00:52:00.320]   one of the websites went out and sort of priced all the components. Oh, yeah. I want to fully
[00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:05.280]   load it. I Mac Pro, right? Seating it better sit down at more than $17,000.
[00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:09.680]   Oh, this could be an iPad play where it actually comes out of 12,000. You think you just saved
[00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:17.920]   yourself. Okay. Yeah. Well, only $12,000. Even that they said 5000 kind of stopped me. It made me
[00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:20.880]   chill. But when the Mac Pro came out, we went through the same thing. We're like, all busy adding
[00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:25.600]   it to the car. What the? Well, I know I did that. Yeah. And then I ended up buying the base model
[00:52:25.600 --> 00:52:29.680]   because I just couldn't. Oh, I'm sorry. Never get Wi-Fi with that. Okay. Well, that's another $1000.
[00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:33.840]   Never get into any more money than you have. All right. And I apologize again for rehashing
[00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:39.760]   old stuff. HomePod. We expected some sort of Syria device. Apple answered our questions. They
[00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:45.600]   said, we're going to be it's really a speaker. It's really just a speaker. It's just fine. It's
[00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:51.520]   a really good play for first generation product. And it's a way to get the device into the door.
[00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:55.520]   And I think in two years time, it will be much more than a speaker, which means that the first
[00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:59.360]   generation has to be a one hell of a great speaker. And that's something that Apple can really be
[00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:03.680]   a great speaker, isn't it? So when I did the Pepsi challenge, Leo, and I went over this previously,
[00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:07.040]   but it would and I don't I don't want to like this because I have a whole bunch of Sonos here.
[00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:10.480]   I have I only want to imagine how much Sonos I have here. But we did a Pepsi challenge where
[00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:15.840]   there was the HomePod. I'm never going to get that name right. The HomePod, the Sonos speaker,
[00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:20.400]   and the Alexa. And we went through six different songs. Some of them were like a live versions of
[00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:23.920]   songs. Some of them were the studio versions of the songs. And they were all different kinds of
[00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:30.160]   music. And they would switch between them. And immediately the Sonos and the HomePod just blow
[00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:33.680]   away the echo because it's not really it's like it's a speaker, but it's not really a speaker. It's
[00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:39.520]   was very small and tinny. But Sonos, I would say one of the songs Sonos held its own. But the HomePod
[00:53:39.520 --> 00:53:45.440]   was incredibly better for a lot of the music. And I think it comes down to the A8 being the DSP.
[00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:50.240]   And that's enough silicon that Apple can essentially do what it does with the iPhone 7 plus camera.
[00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:53.280]   And that is instead of computational photography, do computational audio,
[00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:57.840]   where it's just handling all these processes and using all these different speaker elements
[00:53:57.840 --> 00:54:02.160]   to reform the sound. And it's not like Dolby Atmos because they don't have all the discrete
[00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:06.320]   channels to know where the sound should go. They're doing advanced modeling and continuously
[00:54:06.320 --> 00:54:09.600]   reading the room acoustics and adjusting for them. Does this sound like it's stereo?
[00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:14.480]   It sounds like it's filling your like you can put two of them in and it still sounds
[00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:17.840]   can you can you pair two like you can with Sonos. You can put two you can put three you can have
[00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:20.960]   left or and they'll adjust depending on how many you put in the room.
[00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:24.720]   They're happy to keep taking your money Leo. You put twelve in a room. It's like watch bands.
[00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:30.240]   Yeah. But that is that is interesting comment. It's like I've been testing out a
[00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:36.640]   set of audio engine Bluetooth speakers that I was kind of skeptical about. But they they
[00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:41.440]   I did they just got it's kind of skeptical about. But the mere fact that they are two separate
[00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:47.120]   speakers and good speakers, it really fills the room without anything having to do anything really
[00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:52.240]   fancy and they're good speakers too. And the separation of true stereo as opposed to just good
[00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:56.560]   looking good sounding sound that seems to fill the room. That's a pretty big deal. So that's
[00:54:56.560 --> 00:55:00.400]   something I'm really keen to keen to see. It's like retina for ears Leo. That's only where I
[00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:03.680]   can describe it. Again, I'm not good at audio. So you might find you might have a much better
[00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:07.120]   reading on this when you hear it than I do. But to me it's like after I heard it, this Sonos
[00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:10.720]   sounded a little bit duller and a little bit muddier and I wanted to hear the airpot again.
[00:55:10.720 --> 00:55:15.760]   It does have seven tweeters and a four inch woofer. Do you think that woofer is the coolant? I think
[00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:19.280]   they actually built all the cooling into that woofer which would be clever because it's like
[00:55:19.280 --> 00:55:21.520]   inverted. Tweeters are the things that get hot though.
[00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:29.040]   But you know one of the coolest things about any of these smart speakers is the Twitter array
[00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:35.440]   because do you think it's not just lots of tweeters. It's tweeters that are it's basically
[00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:42.800]   think of them as sound sensors that are giving 360 degree coverage of a plane around this device.
[00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:47.840]   So when I see stuff like that and I think about demos I've had at certain companies,
[00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:52.160]   I think about so in an update a year and a half later it can figure out that there are three
[00:55:52.160 --> 00:55:56.640]   people in this room. And based on what it knows about the movement of people through the house,
[00:55:56.640 --> 00:56:03.520]   it can figure out that okay it's Andy and Renee and Sylvia is still like in the den somewhere.
[00:56:03.520 --> 00:56:07.840]   So I'm going to make sure that if there is a message that's not that's not terribly private for
[00:56:07.840 --> 00:56:13.200]   Andy I'll send it into this room or even the ability to tell a smart thermostat there are people in
[00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:17.840]   this using just sonar there is there are human bodies in this room there are no human bodies in
[00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:22.000]   this other room so maybe you want to redirect the heat and the air conditioning to this part of
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:25.760]   the house not to other parts of the house. That has not been announced or even hinted at by Apple
[00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:31.680]   but this is technology that is very real and very functional and anybody who's designing a home
[00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:37.760]   appliance is if they're designing something to be sold for more than a year they're thinking
[00:56:37.760 --> 00:56:42.880]   very actively about how can we use this sound not just to deliver sound but also to deliver
[00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:46.960]   information to the CPU inside this machine. And Craig mentioned this I think it's safe to talk
[00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:51.760]   about but they didn't talk about Siri at all publicly because they're going to show that off
[00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:56.880]   later in the year but you can stand there and I can be standing next to Andy and the speaker
[00:56:56.880 --> 00:57:01.360]   can be across the room and I can just talk normally and even if Andy can't hear me the speaker can
[00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:07.040]   which is it makes me think of like Daredevil where suddenly like and all you hear is me speaking
[00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:10.800]   because it is doing all of that stuff on the A process or to sort of pull apart the sound
[00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:13.920]   and read what's happening in the room and of course it's serious we're going to have to wait and see
[00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:18.880]   how consistent it is with that experience but the people who have heard this area we're really
[00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:23.840]   really impressed with it. So I'm very so this is will it do the same thing Sonos does which is
[00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:29.680]   party mode without latency in other words multiple speakers in different locations. Airplay too
[00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:34.560]   also does multi-room yeah okay and it works well. Yeah so the Airplay too is a big shift to
[00:57:34.560 --> 00:57:39.040]   multi-room and this will work both with Apple Music natively and with any system over Airplay too
[00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:44.640]   which will also do the multi-room if you have it. So I have to say and this isn't the only data
[00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:52.320]   point but this the death knell for Sonos is ringing they haven't they said they were going to support
[00:57:52.320 --> 00:57:56.480]   Amazon's Echo they haven't yet they said they were going to do that six months ago
[00:57:56.480 --> 00:58:04.000]   at the beginning of the year. I you'd be I think you'd be mistaken to buy another Sonos product at this
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:10.320]   point. And by the way like you Renee I've spent I don't even want to know because I've never
[00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:14.800]   added it up because I only buy it a little at time. Yes that's the thing but I have many.
[00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:19.600]   So they don't have other businesses the way Apple does so they have to maintain solvency with
[00:58:19.600 --> 00:58:28.080]   their speaker business. I don't I think it's over. I wouldn't say so. I hope it's because they're
[00:58:28.080 --> 00:58:33.760]   cross platform and also unlike Apple as when you say they are a speaker business so if they
[00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:38.000]   want if they decide that hey would be great if we made a speaker that's designed specifically to be
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:44.240]   a soundbar type speaker we want to have a bathroom speaker that only costs about 70 dollars and is
[00:58:44.240 --> 00:58:48.400]   waterproof and everything is complete you could drop it in the tub if you had to and would work
[00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:52.880]   just fine. And all these sort of things to make the thing more valuable you think about all
[00:58:52.880 --> 00:58:56.800]   those things you're doing in your smart home where maybe it just started off with a couple of bulbs
[00:58:56.800 --> 00:59:01.040]   and then that that now that you've got nine bulbs you're deciding you're looking at that
[00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:05.120]   thermostat that came with the house that was built in 1968 and you're thinking maybe it's time to
[00:59:05.120 --> 00:59:10.880]   replace that thermostat by the time you get to a certain level of trust of this system you are
[00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:14.720]   who are looking for ways in which you can improve everything around your life by adding things to
[00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:20.640]   this network. So the fact that Apple has this one speaker that is great as an airplane target for
[00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:26.720]   arbitrary sound sources but really is an Apple music device it's going to be a while before it
[00:59:26.720 --> 00:59:31.920]   can give that kind of flexibility and if there are people who already have a 300 500 even thousand
[00:59:31.920 --> 00:59:36.640]   dollar investment in Sonos they're not going to be really eager to drop incompatible device into
[00:59:36.640 --> 00:59:41.200]   that place but it's it really isn't it's one of the more interesting ideas that Apple has had for
[00:59:41.200 --> 00:59:46.320]   a product in the past couple years I think because it is is wealth is so well tuned into what they
[00:59:46.320 --> 00:59:52.240]   do extremely well like I said at the top of the show and also people are people are different about
[00:59:52.960 --> 00:59:59.120]   music today than they were just 10 years ago I when I moved here a number of years ago I only
[00:59:59.120 --> 01:00:05.040]   I only recently unpacked my stereo the the the tuner that I bought 1993 and the speakers I bought
[01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:11.680]   1995 only just to sort of like I wanted like knobs and lights in my office I don't really use them
[01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:17.520]   and when I decided to like finally get a real stereo again it had enough had no correlation whatsoever
[01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:20.960]   to that old idea so there are a lot of people that maybe have been doing that they've been listening
[01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:26.000]   to their music mostly through the sound bar and their TV set which is a really good speaker and
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:30.480]   through little portable bluetooth speakers which are very good speakers and rather than spend
[01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:36.000]   $900 on a really good tuner and a decent pair of speakers maybe they are very very happy to put
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:42.720]   a $350 beautifully designed apples and gorgeously listen gorgeously demoable speaker in their room
[01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:46.160]   and then maybe they'll buy a second one and then because the two work so well in the living room
[01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:50.960]   they'll buy a third for the bedroom so this is a this is an intriguing intriguing product
[01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:54.960]   dare we hope that they start supporting AirPlay 2 and Sonos Leo because then we can just add one of
[01:00:54.960 --> 01:01:01.440]   these in and consider it can airplay 2 to whatever we want to I'm puzzled I feel like Sonos uh you
[01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:07.200]   know they changed CEOs uh they admit that they missed the voice thing and they haven't done
[01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:14.640]   much the only new product they've announced in a year is basically a sound bar with a base
[01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:21.680]   the so it's like hold your TV and I've I almost I mean I look Sonos you know I I love you guys but
[01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:27.360]   I almost feel like they're asleep down there and set a barber and this is it just it just
[01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:31.280]   it's just this is a compelling offering if it sounds it yeah see I didn't think it could sound
[01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:35.840]   as good as a son but if it sounds as good as a sonos sounds better so at least my I spent
[01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:40.320]   admittedly this isn't competing with your five one stereo and you know if you have a really nice
[01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:44.160]   speaker system and really nice stereo system they're not as high they keep compete with that
[01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:48.320]   but what they're trying to do is compete really more with Sonos and perhaps with Echo
[01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:55.600]   and and Google's a home perhaps people are expecting to have a little bit of magic in their
[01:01:55.600 --> 01:01:59.520]   speaker even if it's a limited amount of magic like with the the implementation of Siri that we've
[01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:05.600]   seen in the home pod it just goes to show how complicated this thing is apple can give a thousand
[01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:11.360]   demos in which nobody walks away thinking that this isn't the best little seven inch speaker I've
[01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:17.280]   ever heard in my life but then they'll go home and to their 129 dollar Google home device and say
[01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:23.200]   well I mean it's it's a hundred thousand times better but this is 10 times better than what I need
[01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:27.440]   for the music that I listen to in this space so there's no way to predict if this is really
[01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:34.720]   going to become the next iPod or the next iPod hi-fi yeah right there's a big difference very
[01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:38.400]   candid like when they positioned it they said we have a lot of smart speakers that aren't very
[01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:42.000]   good speakers and a lot of good speakers that aren't very smart and we want to make something
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:47.440]   that sort of meets those in the middle and it's really interesting they've found a new product
[01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:53.600]   category for themselves that combine some of their their real skills yeah yeah that's interesting
[01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:58.480]   I this this occurred to me the other day that apple this apple very recently came up with two
[01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:04.400]   devices that made me super excited about the apple again I mean like as in mac 128 the very
[01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:10.560]   first days excited the iPod iPod and iPhone and iPad first days excited and they are the AirPods
[01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:16.000]   and they are the HomePod because they are such a you can't think if you could you would be able
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:22.000]   to tell instantly by the look of it and also by the attitude the the mindset that went into it
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:26.640]   this is definitely an apple product no other company could do this or execute this as well
[01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:32.080]   as hopefully they're going to do the the HomePod but the AirPods every detail of it is just brilliant
[01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:37.680]   so it's it's exciting to see apple finding its smile so to speak if we if we were talking earlier
[01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:42.640]   about how apple is not showing any visible really excuse me to my point of view any really visible
[01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:47.280]   enthusiasm for mac it is I think they're they're showing even more excitement about the speaker
[01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:56.960]   technology than they are in ios right now yeah it's really interesting um and as apple has proven
[01:03:56.960 --> 01:04:02.160]   with the the headphones for the iPhone nobody really cares about quality anymore the the
[01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:06.640]   I mean seriously there's stereo files there are audio files out there and they're never going to
[01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:13.280]   buy this but for the vast majority of people this is fine people likes for crying out loud how many
[01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:19.360]   bows sound wave radios were sold and beats headphones and beats that I mean we know people don't
[01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:23.600]   really care that much about if it's it's good enough it's it sounds good oh it sounds good they're
[01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:30.800]   handsome boom in base yeah it's a boom in base right they're happy so um but the question is you
[01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:36.240]   know you can get better speakers for even for less money but without any smarts yeah how important
[01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:41.760]   is the smarts and how well can apple execute the smarts and it sounds like I don't know very
[01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:45.520]   interesting and it's an ecosystem play because especially with ios 11 everything is just going
[01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:48.880]   to auto set up and auto share credentials and you'll bring it home you'll plug it in and it'll just
[01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:53.360]   work with all your stuff yeah that's a compelling argument for people who who don't find technology
[01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:58.400]   that addressable yeah and i hope and i hope that it shows the same flexibility as if they've shown
[01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:04.000]   with the AirPods where i i was in love with my AirPods before i even introduced it to any ios
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:09.200]   device i was using it just with my just as an a pair of uh of android phone headphones they were
[01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:14.400]   earpods they were really really good so so long as they maintain that if so i think i'm less
[01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:18.960]   impressed with apple when they make it is right to show some we can make really really great hardware
[01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:23.840]   that works awesomely so long as we can absolutely predict and control everything that ever happens
[01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:28.880]   with this ever so so long as they have the same attitude where i would love to see a future update
[01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:34.240]   where it can actually accept bluetooth because that's that would add a lot of value to this to
[01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:38.880]   this device for people who buy it but then a year and three months later they still love it but
[01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:43.360]   they're the way that they use speakers has changed and oh my god if this thing had bluetooth or even
[01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:47.760]   just a simple audio in how much more could i use this but i can't because there are a
[01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:53.040]   cross-platform family so how so you said it's not cross-platform what does that mean it's
[01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:57.360]   it's not bluetooth it's it's it has apple music directly it can do it can stream apple music
[01:05:57.360 --> 01:06:01.360]   directly from your account from the cloud and it has app um airplay to support so it doesn't do
[01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:06.480]   direct okay so if i have google music there's no way for me to play you can airplay it from an ios device
[01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:10.880]   that has google music spotify i could airplay and to andy's point that is if you're in a cross-device
[01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:14.400]   household where maybe you have an iphone on your wife has an android or your child has uh you know
[01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:18.160]   a pc or something and you want everyone to use it there's no word on that yet like andy i really
[01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:22.160]   hope they add it they did add it to the home to the air pods so there's you know there's reason to be
[01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:26.560]   hopeful but they weren't talking about it at least yet that so that would be i mean it's really
[01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:32.080]   made for people who are in the apple ecosystem that yeah okay it's not available till december so
[01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:37.040]   again like the iac pro you can you can hold on and only in three unilingual english countries
[01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:42.080]   at launch interesting why is it not available till december that seems like an easy product
[01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:48.240]   finished what's so hard about it yet it's a speaker i mean it's it's and i think there's also
[01:06:48.240 --> 01:06:52.000]   some hesitation because with air pods it was you know it was announced and then it was delayed and
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:55.200]   it was still hard to find and i think apple doesn't want to repeat it that which is why they're
[01:06:55.200 --> 01:07:01.040]   tightly controlling where it's going to ship and what it's expected of at launch huh all right
[01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:07.760]   there is a rumor that i think you probably want to debunk but we'll talk about that in just a second
[01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:13.200]   and more apple news rene richie from i'm more dot com any knocko from the shakan go sun
[01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:20.000]   times oops before we move on we like we got a arc it pretty right on the whole let's talk about
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:23.520]   yeah well no let's i gotta take a break but let's talk about when i come back because that's
[01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:29.760]   another good point though there's a lot of evidence from wwdc that apple in fact some people are saying
[01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:35.360]   apple's gonna skip generations and gonna be the next big thing in ar maybe maybe i will be
[01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:41.920]   taking scobled at dinner in paris in december i hope not no clear life on your safe yeah i think
[01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:46.960]   you made a mistake saying clear iPhone you should double down on the ar thing yes uh another click
[01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:51.200]   well i'll talk about what it what is apple what have we learned about apple and ar uh two weeks
[01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:55.600]   ago and i'm sorry again uh leo's just catching up i feel like ripped van winkle we've seen the
[01:07:55.600 --> 01:07:58.160]   demos now though it's new because people are actually playing well there is and there's more
[01:07:58.160 --> 01:08:03.680]   information yeah there's more information so that's good our show today brought to you by uh a really
[01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:11.840]   great new travel site highly recommend from the guy who created uh price line i hesitate saying that
[01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:18.720]   because uh it's not like price line at all but jay walker is a brilliant guy he's very great
[01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:24.320]   entrepreneur serial entrepreneur and he saw an opportunity in business travel to create a site
[01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:28.800]   that solves a problem for companies like mine any small to medium business that doesn't have a
[01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:33.360]   travel bureau and when i worked at the big company like zif davis you you were going to employ you
[01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:37.200]   know if you're going to go to com decks or whatever you'd call the travel department they booked the
[01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:42.800]   flight they had pre negotiated deals with hotels i remember we had to stay at the mgm grand for years
[01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:47.520]   because they had like a 10 year deal with the mgm grand and vegas then they pre negotiated airline
[01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:51.680]   deals and so they would just do it all for you it was great but if you're a small business you
[01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:56.880]   don't have that cloud you don't have the travel department and and you got to do it all on your own
[01:08:57.680 --> 01:09:04.400]   i got a great way to do it it's called upside upside dot com they bundle flights and hotels
[01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:07.600]   together because if you're doing business travel you need it you know your business trip you need a
[01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:14.240]   hotel to write so where you say is where you're flying from in my case san francisco and let's go
[01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:19.680]   to let's go to a new york new york and i think i want to take a trip uh let's say
[01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:25.920]   uh day after the fourth of july and i'm going to stay through a saturday
[01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:32.160]   you can choose your cabin class you can choose uh your business purpose work
[01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:36.160]   you can just decide whether you want to make it or fun well that's it it's very simple
[01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:41.280]   it's very simple uh now let's press get started now what it's going to do is not going to offer
[01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:46.160]   you as some of the other sites do a thousand choices it's got it's going to give you the first
[01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:51.920]   six best choices for what you want to do with the best prices and if you want more you can click
[01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:56.320]   again and again and go to more but really the idea is to make this as easy as possible for you
[01:09:56.320 --> 01:10:04.480]   so i mean i've got this is hotel and airfare i've got this is good i love virgin america
[01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:11.360]   times look good uh shall i shall i pick this flight let's let's see um and by the way notice
[01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:15.280]   you know everything is no surprise let's so let's select the flight now they're going to bundle
[01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:20.560]   a hotel in with it and you're going to see what the state what the what the savings is is just
[01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:26.720]   remarkable but there's more all right now i am going to be picky because i know where i like to stay
[01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:34.800]   in uh new york oh this looks good a little uh let's go a little downtown four star hotel all right
[01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:40.160]   now normally that'll be seven or eight hundred bucks uh they've got a great deal for you
[01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:47.280]   airfare total of books separately nine ninety so your company saves forty bucks but look at this
[01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:53.920]   you also get a gift card and if you're booking for your company and you own the company with what i
[01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:58.080]   always do i apply the gift card to the price of the package then they even say more like you
[01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:02.800]   save even more money get a seventy dollar gift card if you stay at the new york jolly madison
[01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:08.320]   towers don't i don't know where that is but you see the deal now let me tell you a little bit about
[01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:14.800]   this gift card your gift card it comes from one of i think they have 50 different vendors including
[01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:22.320]   you know amazon um you know all the people that you know and love target so you're going to get a
[01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:27.680]   real gift card you're going to get it by email in 72 hours it's yours your company gets the deal
[01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:32.480]   on the on the airfare and i tell you get a little side benefits that's their incentive for you to do
[01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:36.960]   and as again if i'm buying for myself and my company i just apply the price of the gift card
[01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:43.200]   and i save even more money which is awesome now we've got a deal for you that by the way that
[01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:49.280]   took me a couple of minutes that's all it's very fast and it's flexible you save immediately you
[01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:54.880]   receive gift cards it is the easiest way to do business travel and if you use the off-road
[01:11:54.880 --> 01:12:00.560]   mac break right now you'll get a guaranteed minimum hundred dollar gift card on your very first trip
[01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:06.800]   now that is a good deal upside dot com there is a minimum purchase required see the site for
[01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:11.600]   complete details this is the best way from now on it's the only way we do our business travel
[01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:16.960]   booking and whether you're an employee or an owner it's how you should be doing your booking and by
[01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:22.400]   the way if you're not the owner it does gift cards that really is a nice little perk for the employee
[01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:27.520]   upside dot com we thank them so much for their support for mac break weekly don't forget the
[01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:33.600]   offer code mac break and in our code we get them back we had a little disconnect hi Andy
[01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:38.240]   sorry that my my max just absolutely crashed oh and their little speaking is my
[01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:42.560]   that's a weird thing when i heard what you said about ipad and it got upset remember it used to
[01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:48.160]   uh computers and everything used to crash all the time yes and now it's so rare that you it's like
[01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:54.160]   what it crashed when it's last time you saw like yeah kernel panic yeah yeah we've got a lot more
[01:12:54.160 --> 01:13:00.640]   reliable but we forget about that all right let's talk about augmented reality because a lot of
[01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:08.800]   conversation about what apple implied well for instance apple just created and killed
[01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:12.720]   according to tech crunch a generation of a our businesses
[01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:19.280]   uh tell me so what did apple announce and what are we projecting what are we like for
[01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:23.440]   instance we're projecting because of the extra power in the new ipad pro there's going to be
[01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:28.640]   a our capabilities coming in the future when they should have also introduced and let any
[01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:33.680]   just just just quickly that uh it's a great headline because uh a augmented reality used to be
[01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:37.600]   something that you had you really had to roll yourself and it was exotic technology you've had
[01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:42.560]   either be someone or hire someone who knew how to do all the gpu stuff all the graphic stuff
[01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:48.320]   all the uh tracking stuff just to get anything going on ar and then apple comes along and says
[01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:54.560]   that we will we ar kit uh will tell you that there is a flat surface where that flat surface is
[01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:59.840]   it will tell you it knows where the light source is it knows where what the user is doing with
[01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:05.920]   this phone so really to a to a certain extent all you have to do is give us a 3d model of something
[01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:10.480]   point us to the what surface it needs to be on we will not only place it there so it looks like
[01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:15.120]   it's on that surface be at a table the floor of a piece of piece of piece of road but we will
[01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:19.520]   also make sure it matches the lighting and it's properly scaled for what is around it so you don't
[01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:24.480]   have to do anything this is all a library built into the uh iowa it's not as easy it's not as easy
[01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:28.880]   as click and drag but it means that so much of your work has been done which is why the the first
[01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:33.680]   episode of uh uh the planet of the apps that i saw was hysterically funny this is the one where
[01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:38.800]   people are pitching their brilliant app that for for investors and they're the whole thing is we
[01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:44.160]   spent so much time and money and effort developing an ar system that nobody else has that and now
[01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:49.280]   we can sell this to like ikea if ikea wants to have write an app that has puts a piece of furniture and
[01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:52.960]   someone's home they can actually they'll go to us for the technology because our technology is
[01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:58.000]   so expensive and so horrible that are really complicated and we'll do it so easily that no
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:03.120]   there is arkett and ikea own in house people can probably do that themselves now yeah i said
[01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:08.320]   matthew panzerino and tech crunch said that pear which is the app that you saw on planet of the
[01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:14.560]   apps inaugural episode has been Sherlock yes yeah whoops all right i don't i don't want to laugh
[01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:19.440]   because it's horrible no it's bad news but it's like oh my god i wonder if they chose this as the
[01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:24.960]   first episode to to distribute because they knew that oh by the way we we go look at the keynote
[01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:31.360]   rehearsal and this guy's life is going to get a lot different uh that's not it's super interesting
[01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:35.040]   like a couple years ago apple acquired a company i think it's called Mateo or mail it was tech
[01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:39.360]   crunch reported on at the time and they had it was a really user friendly or forward friendly
[01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:43.280]   api and apple acquired them and acquired some other companies they've been working on this for a
[01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:48.400]   while uh and it has a couple really interesting things going for it like and he said it it just
[01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:52.720]   does a lot of the hard stuff we saw a demo where well we played uh star wars hollow chest with
[01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:56.480]   job of the hut which is lucky because chibaka can pull your arms off his arm sure to short
[01:15:56.480 --> 01:16:02.560]   do not meet the woody and you could put like a lamp on the table a chair on the ground and a
[01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:06.880]   coffee cup on the table and move that pet around it it knows what services to stick those to and
[01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:10.880]   as you move the coffee cup around it does the scaling for it and we put it next to a cup and for
[01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:14.160]   a second the guy's like i forgot which one was real and then try to move both of them
[01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:19.040]   and it worked really really well and you really do see the power of these new ipads behind it
[01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:24.240]   but what's cool is like you can see tim cook's excitement about it like he has not been able to
[01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:30.000]   help himself talking about how cool uh ar technology is and and where it can be everywhere uh but
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:34.240]   what was really impressive too is they showed like sort of exactly like we predicted on on mac
[01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:38.400]   break weekly a few weeks ago the polka even something as simple as a pokemon go demo it just
[01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:42.800]   it makes the game better and they don't have to switch over to apple technologies to metal or to
[01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:47.120]   ar kit to do it because unity will do that for them so it'll just make the experience of playing
[01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:52.160]   ar games on ios better i don't want to use it for free term because it's abused but technically for
[01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:56.640]   free for a lot of developers and it'll it'll be an ikea and it'll be in pokemon go and it'll be in
[01:16:56.640 --> 01:17:00.400]   all these apps and it'll be great for education where you can you know hold it up in the classroom
[01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:04.720]   and for tech support where you hold it up and you know which exact button to press to reboot that
[01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:08.640]   server when no one else is around and i'm super excited about it as well panzerino's quote
[01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:14.880]   from his article on tech crunch apple just built the ar industry shovel now all you have to do is
[01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:21.440]   decide where to dig yeah um that that's pretty so exciting yeah so our people adopting it already
[01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:27.200]   i besides ikea i mean ikea did but who is this like are we gonna see a million apps in five minutes
[01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:33.040]   well when i was 11 oh you guys i was we're gonna see a million pokemon clones in five minutes the
[01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:37.600]   first the minute that i was ever i was but after but after that i look i'm looking for the person who
[01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:43.040]   just has this brilliant idea there there are brilliant man or woman they just aren't brilliant
[01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:48.080]   about ar but now apple has made them ar brilliant and so if they want to make this app that will put
[01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:53.440]   hang on your role anywhere you want it to go or just going to my favorite my favorite conjecture
[01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:59.120]   is the idea of walking through london and saying oh going through the tower london and saying well
[01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:04.480]   or if you turn on this ar app where we will put you where you are standing right now the way it would
[01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:10.800]   have been when it was an active prison for upscale british british royalty and just turn around and
[01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:15.680]   look at nope that that's new oh wow oh my god there's like lions and bears and a duck over there
[01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:20.240]   that in cages what's that all about just the idea that things that can be done with someone's
[01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:26.480]   imagination and apple will bring the api for for your said guy named kody brown made a demo with
[01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:32.160]   a r kit and created this is a widow maker one of the characters from overwatch in his house
[01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:38.800]   including by the way fog and lighting effects uh that's terrifying uh and he seemed like on the
[01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:43.280]   vive leo they have people who've just used the unity or the 3d this is unreal engine to make
[01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:47.840]   amazing games on the vive like like a lightsaber simulator just one person made it or that i
[01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:51.280]   forget the name of that dungeon and dragons game but they're amazing and because of the tools they
[01:18:51.280 --> 01:18:54.880]   can make these games and this this is giving them the tools imagine playing overwatch
[01:18:55.920 --> 01:19:03.920]   in your room terrifying um i mean i'm not excited by this this is kind of amazing yeah yeah uh so
[01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:11.120]   so as have you played i mean uh how hard is this to to work with is it it's in sprint playground
[01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:16.160]   it's sorry it's in uh swift play it is so we can try yeah oh yeah so you which i think is a great
[01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:21.040]   move by apple to get people wall ages just be thinking of ar and i think i was also really
[01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:25.360]   canny of uh tim cukawalago where he sort of implied that for apple ar was not a specific product
[01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:28.960]   it wasn't a set of goggles or spectacles or anything else it was what was going to be a
[01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:33.200]   pervasive technology throughout all their product lines and this is a huge first step in that direction
[01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:38.400]   yeah and what a great it probably wasn't a it was too in the cards too long to be a response to
[01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:43.440]   anything but what a great book and response to the google i/o keynote in which they were showing
[01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:47.840]   a brilliant stuff that google's doing without men in reality but it's all about and when people
[01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:52.560]   buy these devices when people buy the special foam the special sensors and when when this device
[01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:56.720]   which is not available to consumers yet but it's in developers hands apple has said
[01:19:56.720 --> 01:19:59.360]   you know the you know the device you're using to watch this q note right now
[01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:04.240]   well in six months it will be your ar device you already own it just you might want to delete a
[01:20:04.240 --> 01:20:08.320]   couple of apps first but if it's if you're taking too much space but you're good thanks scope
[01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:13.040]   that's what was right maybe this is a very interesting it's not what we thought what it's what it is
[01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:18.240]   and it's very smart is it enables developers all of whom are you know want to try this
[01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:24.080]   so the guy who did that overwatch a demo kody brown is a founder of a virtual reality production
[01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:30.000]   studio called irl here's the quote from motherboard the most impressive aspect of ar kid is it tends
[01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:35.920]   to just work other ar software often requires some sort of physical tracking mechanism like a qr
[01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:40.960]   code you know you have to point your camera at something which inevitably becomes a major
[01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:44.640]   piece of friction if you're trying to get anyone to use this stuff another incredible aspect of
[01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:49.760]   ar kid is how it handles lighting adjustments in real time i can only imagine the math and magic
[01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:57.520]   underneath this tech to make it work here's a uh... kyle rustle uh... to be tweeted uh just a
[01:20:57.520 --> 01:21:06.720]   uh a picture of a jet on an ipad but he shows you how the jet maintains its positioning even as you
[01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:13.040]   move around it you can walk around the object it's pretty darn smart and the fact that these guys
[01:21:13.840 --> 01:21:22.240]   are making these demos already is very interesting so uh this makes the ipad particularly i think
[01:21:22.240 --> 01:21:29.120]   less so the iphone but makes but certainly the iphone but but this makes ios very intriguing right
[01:21:29.120 --> 01:21:32.800]   and it's sort of the democratization of technology that apple has been involved with you know at least
[01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:36.560]   you know since steve job started the company where now ar is accessible to you know people who have
[01:21:36.560 --> 01:21:41.600]   hundreds of millions of devices and even things like core ml which sounds all which sounds like a
[01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:45.600]   niche thing they made it open so you can pull in models from any source and and they'll just all
[01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:49.600]   convert to open ml and that will make uh... machine learning more accessible to everybody
[01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:53.360]   and there were a series of technologies they sort of announced in rapid fire craig federiki
[01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:57.760]   fashion that could be transformative on their own but when put together and how long is it until
[01:21:57.760 --> 01:22:02.400]   that airplane is using machine learning to fly around that room not hitting objects it's gonna be
[01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:08.240]   great and what's what's really exciting is unlike google's project tango you you already have the
[01:22:08.240 --> 01:22:14.320]   hardware that you need it's been built in i present now with the iphone seven uh have enough force power
[01:22:14.320 --> 01:22:18.240]   we're gonna have to wait for the next iphone it's an a ten so it's the same horsepower that's in that
[01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:24.240]   ipad um yeah and what's what's super smart about this is if apple ever does get into ar hardware
[01:22:24.240 --> 01:22:28.640]   they will have had all this content built out for them on their platform already brilliant right
[01:22:28.640 --> 01:22:33.680]   don't do the hardware yeah uh just make it possible for soft for developers to do it
[01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:45.760]   um wow you achieve you achieve a new level of power and and uh and destiny when you decide to let go
[01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:50.320]   of control of your own platform and you say we're going to let the entire world discover the awesome
[01:22:50.320 --> 01:22:54.880]   of a tool we're not going to build something and ask people to buy it and support it and this is
[01:22:54.880 --> 01:23:00.560]   very much uh that kind of a thing uh this is shano kane who collated a bunch of videos and gifs this
[01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:07.600]   is a uh iphone based ar fidget spinner that's on that looks like it's on your table is it as
[01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:13.200]   stress reducing as a real thing though probably not but that's a pretty good demo i mean if you've
[01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:18.640]   played with uh previous ar even pokemon go you realize if they don't have that kind of they don't
[01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:24.320]   feel stable in the environment as you move this stuff around this stuff is rocks rock solid the
[01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:31.360]   future this is the future of business graphics put a barcode flow to barcode over your desk
[01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:37.920]   this is from a zam sharp was this shown at wwdc this by the way 60 frames a second
[01:23:37.920 --> 01:23:42.880]   yes yeah no it's great and think about your first day at a new company like if your first day at
[01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:47.040]   the apple ac2 campus you have no idea where to go you hold up your iphone and little ar
[01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:50.960]   ar assistant walks you right to your desk and it's just so many things that this would be interesting
[01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:55.920]   brand inside bottom doodling with a new ar kit he says if you want to vandalize without the messy
[01:23:55.920 --> 01:24:01.680]   consequences start spray painting your and you put in air pods and suddenly you have ar audio as
[01:24:01.680 --> 01:24:07.760]   well as video i mean this is very intriguing i have to say i was skeptical about what apple
[01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:14.160]   would do but this is exactly the right way to do it uh and and and then they own it by the way
[01:24:14.160 --> 01:24:21.920]   because you have to have an apple device to do this it's krigger's wife uh virtual pets
[01:24:21.920 --> 01:24:29.360]   look at that have a dog in your house um wow okay i might are they now support for both i might
[01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:36.640]   just buy a scoble dinner just because because i'm so impressed by this it's not what he said it's
[01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:40.800]   not exactly a clear iphone although if you think about it if you get the screen big enough yeah
[01:24:42.080 --> 01:24:47.680]   uh it's certainly i think so the uses are going to vary an iphone sure for navigation
[01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:53.520]   but an ipad it's going to be pretty interesting uh because workout after because you have to
[01:24:53.520 --> 01:24:58.720]   hold it up while you're doing the workout so then you get the arms going to yeah here's a bb8 in your
[01:24:58.720 --> 01:25:05.520]   kitchen look at that it's so great and it really look at the shadow uh look at how well it adheres
[01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:11.280]   to the floor um yeah this is this is scaling as well just that that just that is simple is
[01:25:11.280 --> 01:25:15.920]   is brilliant enough for the idea that it's is the right size when you get near it everything is
[01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:21.600]   just scaling properly that is and as you fidget with the ipad it's staying rock solid right so do you
[01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:27.680]   think this is technology apple acquired uh developed in house yeah both both yeah from a few years ago
[01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:33.200]   and then they added its own elf and magic access to the burritos in the in the apple commissary has
[01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:39.920]   its own sort of gamma ray effect on an an a good acquired company here's uh adam uh debra
[01:25:39.920 --> 01:25:46.240]   shends sheber debra sheney sorry adam he uh he took the map of his bike ride and is super
[01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:53.440]   imposed it on his coffee table with the the terrain and everything um that's unity plus ar kit plus
[01:25:53.440 --> 01:26:01.440]   map box plus strava okay okay i'm sold in an education this is going to be so brilliant you
[01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:06.000]   think about the ways that when when we were growing up we had calculators but we didn't really have
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:10.560]   data visualization easily on the computers that we have back then and now when you're learning math
[01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:17.360]   you don't just understand trigonometry you understand how cosines and all those functions work in 3d
[01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:22.880]   space and 4d space just by playing with them as graphical objects now imagine when you have the
[01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:28.320]   ability to not just understand here is a photo of matchu pichu and here is a photo of the bottom of
[01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:33.680]   the mountain and if you the ability of the kids say okay guess what you're in a helicopter and you
[01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:37.920]   are here are the controls of the helicopter and here's matchu pichu we'll be back in a half hour
[01:26:37.920 --> 01:26:42.240]   to discuss everything that you've seen it's it really just gets you everybody excited and if it
[01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:49.600]   doesn't check your pulse man yeah wow uh really it's really kind of amazing it was a good dub w
[01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:55.520]   yeah yeah well i'm sorry i missed those particular uh and by the way they threw out vr and they threw
[01:26:55.520 --> 01:27:03.840]   out you know h.265 and hdr and a whole bunch of other stuff just as an aside yeah i did a um
[01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:10.000]   i did a number of 360 videos with the samsung gear camera i think you liked i think i remember
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:16.000]   you like that uh Andy yeah i recommended the police goes by far yeah and um there's one of the
[01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:22.960]   sun rising uh over matchu pichu wow uh and it's it does really make you think this is this is an
[01:27:22.960 --> 01:27:28.400]   opportunity to share experiences in a much more experiential way
[01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:36.960]   um and it was easy right i just put the thing yeah and it did a time lapse uh and there and there
[01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:42.880]   it is so that's that's the power of simplicity you wouldn't you wouldn't have you had the ability
[01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:48.800]   through and any number of downloadable apps to shoot a 360 degree photosphere from that spot if
[01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:54.000]   you really really wanted to do it but when you have a device in your pocket that you remember that
[01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:58.640]   oh it's about the size of half a candy bar it yes it is worth 20 seconds of my life to lift it up and
[01:27:58.640 --> 01:28:05.440]   do this like and that's when you start taking 360 degree videos everywhere similar same with this
[01:28:05.440 --> 01:28:10.240]   that's when you have an idea for hey you know what this will this would really be enhanced with AR
[01:28:10.240 --> 01:28:14.960]   but i don't want to i don't want to spend a year figuring out how to do this but i will spend the
[01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:19.840]   next couple of weekends playing around in playgrounds to see how hard it is to do realize it's really
[01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:25.680]   not that hard and then add that to the app that's you make something easy you make you really light
[01:28:25.680 --> 01:28:35.200]   up someone's creativity and that's how you make technology better yeah um very exciting okay rumor
[01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:43.280]   you can just you come completely to buck this in one word Renee google will find a new home on ios
[01:28:43.280 --> 01:28:50.000]   this fall and instead of Siri you'll find the google assistant true or false i mean if apple
[01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:54.320]   makes a Siri kit extension for other assistants and then Alexa and google and everybody can play
[01:28:54.320 --> 01:29:00.320]   with it i think you know that that that that can't see apple giving up yeah but no no there you can
[01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:06.240]   know you on a platform where you can't even say oh by the way i have this other winnope nope well
[01:29:06.240 --> 01:29:11.680]   what if i want to open a graphic except nope nope remember i message for android was a rumor
[01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:16.800]   last year so these things come and go oh i wish that rumor had come true that's well you got i
[01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:21.280]   message on the web so well not on the web you got you got i cloud fried message so yeah baby steps
[01:29:21.280 --> 01:29:26.720]   now i know i think apple smart just lock everybody into the goddamn apple operating system what the
[01:29:26.720 --> 01:29:31.920]   hell right that is the definition of a backhanded compliment i think they're very very smart to
[01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:36.880]   put an extra level of iron around the handcuffs they've already put it's locked it gets a cut out
[01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:40.800]   they get the blame there's there's nowhere else to go with that lock come along maybe if they have
[01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:44.160]   their boot heel on their necks they won't even bother to struggle anymore and they'll be so
[01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:52.240]   much happier yeah here's the uh took me a while here's the uh the vr i'll skip ahead here
[01:29:52.240 --> 01:29:58.080]   uh of now so the best way to do this would be to put on a vr visor see apple still doesn't have
[01:29:58.080 --> 01:30:03.520]   anything like that right and then yeah and then looks around for the live now oh that's right okay
[01:30:03.520 --> 01:30:08.080]   so you can look around so but but it's also good enough for just the the phone based viewers to
[01:30:08.080 --> 01:30:13.200]   stand in one place and just be walking around and that's true it's it's amazing how the people who
[01:30:13.200 --> 01:30:18.160]   people who can't imagine themselves using ar don't want one of these apps and try them out you'll be
[01:30:18.160 --> 01:30:24.080]   surprised at how quickly you're you're in your office or you're in your living room and but suddenly
[01:30:24.080 --> 01:30:27.680]   you are just like looking just like you do when you're your own tourist you spend a lot of your
[01:30:27.680 --> 01:30:32.480]   time unfortunately looking at some of the most brilliant landscapes through the screen of your
[01:30:32.480 --> 01:30:38.000]   phone anyway but then you're transported to this place when you have the freedom to suddenly
[01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:42.800]   i wonder what i wonder what the ceiling inside the link memorial looks like because no one
[01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:46.560]   takes a picture of the ceiling but it can encourage you to look up and say oh my god there's this
[01:30:46.560 --> 01:30:51.120]   really nice arrangement of sky oh now i know why there's it's always there is always this light
[01:30:51.120 --> 01:30:56.080]   that's hitting the top of able and can't say that's how they did that and i mean this is a non-trivial
[01:30:56.080 --> 01:31:03.520]   thing to get up into the andes and see this and most of the time it's only about one day and five
[01:31:03.520 --> 01:31:08.240]   you get a clear day like this so this is a real privilege so the ability to share it
[01:31:08.240 --> 01:31:13.440]   it's paused here but the ability to share it the sun comes up and then you see the light from the
[01:31:13.440 --> 01:31:21.440]   sun slowly fill in the mountain and fill in the uh the the site is pretty i was thrilled to be able
[01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:25.520]   to share this i wish i'd found a better spot to take it though i didn't realize you can't that's
[01:31:25.520 --> 01:31:30.320]   one thing you can't really be sure what it's going to look like until it happens nevertheless i mean
[01:31:30.320 --> 01:31:34.960]   this is this is a great way to share this experience and you can look around you can see what i was
[01:31:34.960 --> 01:31:39.680]   doing well well well the sun was coming so one of us will go to all every awesome place we'll just
[01:31:39.680 --> 01:31:49.200]   send back i think so for the rest of us i think so i took 360 video of uh riding in a uh zodiac
[01:31:49.200 --> 01:31:55.920]   uh in the galapagos so you know you don't have to students i mean obviously better to go to the
[01:31:55.920 --> 01:32:02.480]   galapagos better much better but uh there's an opportunity here to have experiences in a kind of a very
[01:32:02.480 --> 01:32:10.480]   dynamic way um that's pretty exciting however i think augmented reality is really exciting and
[01:32:10.480 --> 01:32:15.440]   the long run and more useful people always think about something strapped to your head and interfering
[01:32:15.440 --> 01:32:19.440]   with what you're seeing they don't think about taking out the getting off of the subway stop
[01:32:19.440 --> 01:32:25.040]   taking out a phone and seeing a big yellow brick road literally a yellow brick road going down 23rd
[01:32:25.040 --> 01:32:29.040]   street up fifth avenue with a big arrow saying here is where you need to go here's where your
[01:32:29.040 --> 01:32:33.280]   meeting is or here's where that restaurant is and once again you understand that yeah
[01:32:33.280 --> 01:32:37.360]   it's just some people aren't visual some people are audio i like the audio thing and nobody's really
[01:32:37.360 --> 01:32:41.360]   licked that very well uh that's been always a challenge so that's going to be exciting to
[01:32:41.360 --> 01:32:47.760]   hear that coming through the app uh airpods right uh all right what else did i did uh every anything
[01:32:47.760 --> 01:32:52.720]   else to cover um before we use wise there's the leak of the leakers that was that was hugely
[01:32:52.720 --> 01:32:55.840]   amusing the leak of the leakers you tell the leak about the leak meeting
[01:32:55.840 --> 01:33:05.120]   yeah okay i i bookmarked that but remind me again uh this is this is apple apple this is an
[01:33:05.120 --> 01:33:10.480]   insight into apple's secrecy and to be clear they've been having these meetings for these
[01:33:10.480 --> 01:33:13.440]   meetings for a while these are not new it just this is the first time one of these meetings
[01:33:13.440 --> 01:33:17.520]   actually leaked and it's it looks like a recent meeting yeah and this is just like apple continuing
[01:33:17.520 --> 01:33:21.680]   to try to buckle down on leaks coming from the company but it discloses several interesting
[01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:26.320]   things like that they found a leak within itunes and they found a leak within uh the apple
[01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:30.240]   the apple online organization that they managed to plug last year and when you look about what
[01:33:30.240 --> 01:33:34.560]   leak this year versus previous years uh it it's apparent that some things you know some things are
[01:33:34.560 --> 01:33:38.560]   still coming out of the supply chain we're still seeing i fun eight things but a large amount of
[01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:43.120]   software stuff didn't leak this year that did leak last year so um but the they were throwing
[01:33:43.120 --> 01:33:47.200]   shade too like it's like the guy's saying oh even groover is telling people that people can't
[01:33:47.200 --> 01:33:51.280]   get leaks anymore that's all right you know it's just the whole thing was very it was very fun to me
[01:33:51.280 --> 01:33:56.880]   and they're using uh like nsa former nsa people i mean they're really
[01:33:56.880 --> 01:34:02.320]   my tweet this morning uh and i didn't get a chance to listen to the recording but my tweet
[01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:09.440]   this morning was uh steve jobs paranoia lives on but so do you think it really is a benefit to apple
[01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:18.560]   to be this paranoid and this secretive i would say so i would say so about cont about information
[01:34:18.560 --> 01:34:24.080]   getting out that is untimely that is incorrect that is inaccurate that reflects a stage of their
[01:34:24.080 --> 01:34:28.080]   thinking that is still ongoing i think that's they're very much in the right to do that i do
[01:34:28.080 --> 01:34:32.480]   think they should be more open i think they can solve a lot of this by simply deciding that it's
[01:34:32.480 --> 01:34:35.760]   okay if a year from now we show you here's something we're thinking about right now here's where we
[01:34:35.760 --> 01:34:39.280]   are on this i think that would have put for instance a lot of people's worries about the mac at
[01:34:39.280 --> 01:34:45.520]   rest if they knew before having the summit of the five of five pundits saying okay we are
[01:34:45.520 --> 01:34:49.840]   understanding that we probably need to take a look at the mac pro we are working on this and
[01:34:49.840 --> 01:34:53.280]   please don't go out to the hardware hangs and start buying stuff so you can build your own
[01:34:53.280 --> 01:34:58.720]   mac pro right now we are built we're working on it but yeah to you don't want people if you think
[01:34:58.720 --> 01:35:03.280]   about the things that happen in your own office that out of context and not just explain that this
[01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:07.360]   is just something that i was thinking about doing or thinking about writing this is not part of the
[01:35:07.360 --> 01:35:11.120]   structure of the company and if someone decides they want to leak this out to tell everybody that
[01:35:11.120 --> 01:35:16.560]   that uh apple is planning is putting a month it was seriously thinking about a helicopter
[01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:21.120]   with londarts on it like they're not they were just doing it having a drawing a fun drawing session
[01:35:21.120 --> 01:35:24.160]   on the the new thing that they're that you didn't even figure out about come on
[01:35:24.160 --> 01:35:32.560]   uh at one point they show a video uh to the team about leaks and at the end uh the speaker says so
[01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:38.960]   you heard tim say we have one more thing so what is that one more thing surprise and delight
[01:35:38.960 --> 01:35:43.600]   surprise and delight when we announce a product of the world that hasn't leaked it's incredibly
[01:35:43.600 --> 01:35:50.080]   impactful in a positive way it's our dna it's our brand but when leaks get out that's even more
[01:35:50.080 --> 01:35:56.240]   impactful it's a direct hit to all of us so i i haven't listened to it did you listen to the
[01:35:56.240 --> 01:36:01.120]   whole thing uh rene or no i just like again like these these meetings aren't you know it was for
[01:36:01.120 --> 01:36:05.440]   me it was mostly just the laws like that that the the meeting leaked uh you know the leak that's
[01:36:05.440 --> 01:36:10.400]   just funny and by the way credit to josh what's upholsky and his new publication the outline they're
[01:36:10.400 --> 01:36:18.800]   the ones who got the leak uh and wrote this article and uh well done um you know you gotta wonder who
[01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:23.600]   leaked it's a little bit weird too i mean like like you like when you look at some of these things
[01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:27.360]   like it's easy to get it's not easy but like sometimes you get facts but when you start to analyze
[01:36:27.360 --> 01:36:32.400]   them you can go down the wrong path like uh people who talked about before like um
[01:36:32.400 --> 01:36:36.800]   but jonathan zadarski he started deleting his tweets long before apple he got really sort of
[01:36:36.800 --> 01:36:41.760]   moral issues with twitter and oh interesting oh interesting he was deleting every tweet he made
[01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:46.320]   like five minutes after he made it for a while uh and then that was sort of like he just killed
[01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:50.160]   his account and he was talking about that i don't know about publicly but he was talking
[01:36:50.160 --> 01:36:54.160]   about doing that move for a long time so you you can sort of interpret this stuff but not all of
[01:36:54.160 --> 01:37:01.440]   it is going to be accurate yeah um so i don't know if the whole uh recording is available online but
[01:37:01.440 --> 01:37:06.880]   certainly a lot of quotes pull quotes from it and so forth um and they really believe that they
[01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:08.320]   believe that they believe that they believe that they believe that they come up there and surprise
[01:37:08.320 --> 01:37:12.880]   you generate press for them which is incredibly valuable people know about it they get like you
[01:37:12.880 --> 01:37:16.560]   people leave wwc or they leave google ion they go well it was boring well if you read the script
[01:37:16.560 --> 01:37:20.480]   of the new star wars movie you think the new star wars movie was really was boring too and that hurts
[01:37:20.480 --> 01:37:24.880]   right that hurts the property that that's why it's it's interesting to see this as part of a leaked
[01:37:24.880 --> 01:37:29.600]   in turn if it was an internal and internal dialogue that was not meant to be made public
[01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:35.920]   because they say that as though they believe it internally which to me it's like making sure
[01:37:35.920 --> 01:37:39.840]   that things don't leak up before the press event that means you get to control the information you
[01:37:39.840 --> 01:37:45.040]   get to control the marketing you get to have everybody talking about this thing at the same time with
[01:37:45.040 --> 01:37:49.840]   the same data points and at the time that is most advantageous for it to happen for you when you're
[01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:54.800]   trying to get sell people this thing if it's like we just want people to be delighted
[01:37:54.800 --> 01:38:00.160]   which is okay look i'm not 70 years old you're not my parents and it's not christmas morning okay
[01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:05.440]   i'm i've got two thousand dollars and i have to budget for a major purchase and it will help me to
[01:38:05.440 --> 01:38:09.440]   wait and not buy this thing today and be angry with myself three months from now if i know
[01:38:09.440 --> 01:38:13.200]   that three months from now you are you might be thinking of shipping something even if you're
[01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:17.520]   not giving it a ship date even if you're just saying that here is a direction we're considering for
[01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:22.160]   the apple pencil or for the ipad or for the mac it will give me that faith to say you know what i
[01:38:22.160 --> 01:38:25.840]   will do without for three or four months just in case because i know that you've got that the fall
[01:38:25.840 --> 01:38:29.600]   is coming and there might be something interesting coming out but if you decided that we just want
[01:38:29.600 --> 01:38:34.880]   you to be to pet we want any to pad downstairs and it's a little footy pajamas and see Santa Claus
[01:38:34.880 --> 01:38:39.760]   it's like i have i don't know footy pajamas i'm not nearly as adorable when i was seven i wasn't even
[01:38:39.760 --> 01:38:45.440]   very cute back then i'm just somebody who wants to get value for money and please just cut the bs
[01:38:45.440 --> 01:38:49.360]   okay and i have to acknowledge that we are on the we're in the opposition we're the ones we're
[01:38:49.360 --> 01:38:54.960]   trying to find out this information and i so i understand the b i don't care i understand the
[01:38:54.960 --> 01:39:05.280]   business value of apple not having leaks um but i also think that there there's a downside to too
[01:39:05.280 --> 01:39:12.080]   much paranoia and too much closeness that i think the best way to do this is to control
[01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:18.160]   communications and i think apple maybe airs on the side of total silence where it would be really
[01:39:18.160 --> 01:39:22.080]   more valuable and maybe they're changing a little bit because i think love light they've been a little
[01:39:22.080 --> 01:39:26.400]   bit more forth right yeah this is even more than this was even anywhere in apple than before yeah
[01:39:26.400 --> 01:39:32.640]   so like people tell us enough tell us a little bit and it's our job i mean really i think our job is
[01:39:32.640 --> 01:39:37.520]   to tell consumers whether they should wait or whether they shouldn't wait and i you know i
[01:39:37.520 --> 01:39:42.800]   understand that it's better for apple if it's a surprise for everybody but we're not here to make
[01:39:42.800 --> 01:39:47.440]   apple's business better we're better we're here to represent consumers totally and i think that
[01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:50.240]   everyone just sort of knows there's going to be a new iphone every fall but while you were gone
[01:39:50.240 --> 01:39:54.480]   Leo Tim Cook went on a bloomberg interview and said that they're working on autonomous technology
[01:39:54.480 --> 01:39:59.760]   and even a year ago Steve Dalley never done that's able to do it so fast yeah like so fast and the
[01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:04.320]   entire dub dub was was done in a you know a totally different way but even from like my perspective
[01:40:04.320 --> 01:40:08.240]   i've had people complain about apple pr and apple marketing and i've had to deal with all the
[01:40:08.240 --> 01:40:12.880]   companies now and they're just so organized and so brief and i know there was a kerfuffle about
[01:40:12.880 --> 01:40:17.200]   how how technically savvy their marketing team was earlier in the week but i've thrown them all
[01:40:17.200 --> 01:40:23.120]   manner of oddball curveball technical questions that you know salesy marketing people which we've
[01:40:23.120 --> 01:40:27.520]   all met at other companies would panic would instantly be during the headlights and they don't
[01:40:27.520 --> 01:40:31.840]   flinch they just answer like when you start asking about apfs on the mac the marketing people don't
[01:40:31.840 --> 01:40:36.560]   flinch they know every inch of that stack and that takes sort of a lot of time and preparation
[01:40:36.560 --> 01:40:40.080]   and focus on their part and i can understand when they sort of have these things thrown at them
[01:40:40.080 --> 01:40:45.360]   out of sorts they it's just they have it there's advantages and disadvantages to their approach
[01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:48.880]   and one of the advantages they're super well prepared there's advantages they're not prepared
[01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:54.720]   when things don't go the way they plan them right so to sometimes i feel like i'm
[01:40:54.720 --> 01:41:01.600]   i'm the john leon to uh to rene's paul macartney not a bad not a bad team i mean that's good calling
[01:41:01.600 --> 01:41:07.440]   the sense would we with that sense that i i want to say when i hear rene singing it's getting
[01:41:07.440 --> 01:41:13.520]   bet to roll the time give me that pencil it can't get much worse yeah uh but just just for added
[01:41:13.520 --> 01:41:17.920]   perspective yeah uh apple apples uh marketing people are really really on the ball they're
[01:41:17.920 --> 01:41:21.920]   they're a lot more helpful uh they're not they're rarely will let you go on the record with what
[01:41:21.920 --> 01:41:27.040]   you talk them about but they will try really really hard to give you the information you want to that
[01:41:27.680 --> 01:41:33.920]   that said other companies that are as uh as big as apple uh when i deal with them it's like i don't
[01:41:33.920 --> 01:41:38.080]   know why don't i catch you with an engineer and we'll have a conference we'll have a conference
[01:41:38.080 --> 01:41:42.000]   called with like two different engineers and i will get stuff that i could actually use outside
[01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:45.920]   of the conversation so it's it's every single company has to figure out the best way to do it i think
[01:41:45.920 --> 01:41:50.000]   that apple really likes to maintain a lot of control i really when we're talking about the
[01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:55.120]   control of leaks i think that is part of their institutional memory that things do not happen
[01:41:55.120 --> 01:41:59.040]   well if we can't if we don't if we can't at least we're not at least aware of what's going on around
[01:41:59.040 --> 01:42:06.960]   us uh and that can be both good and bad i i do have to say so what so i loved it we had adam
[01:42:06.960 --> 01:42:13.760]   angstrom tidbits on he said we don't do rumors we don't do leaks uh and there and of course with a
[01:42:13.760 --> 01:42:19.600]   with a weekly publication in his case to a weekly show like ours there's not often enough mac news
[01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:26.560]   and apple news to talk about without having throwing some some rumors in um and but i also i i want to
[01:42:26.560 --> 01:42:34.720]   i think uh i i understand and honor apple's desire for secrecy but i want to balance that with our
[01:42:34.720 --> 01:42:41.360]   mission to help consumers so what do you think we should do should we not mention rumors or we
[01:42:41.360 --> 01:42:44.960]   should totally like so my my big thing is that once apple announces that that's it it's static
[01:42:44.960 --> 01:42:49.120]   it's frozen in time we know exactly what it is i like that we discuss the potential like what
[01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:53.600]   andy wants to see in a home up before apple tells us what it is or what you'd like to see like you're
[01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:57.680]   using the new sam's link phone and what does apple have to do with the iphone and rumors help sort of
[01:42:57.680 --> 01:43:02.480]   inform that and sometimes blow back from rumors that have effect on product teams and i think it's
[01:43:02.480 --> 01:43:06.560]   an important part of the discussion as much as apple hates it it's it's a part of the reality
[01:43:06.560 --> 01:43:10.960]   we all live in and again you can go to a movie site and read spoilers about star wars if you choose
[01:43:10.960 --> 01:43:15.920]   to i i would love that readers were adult about it and didn't say oh boring because i read it before
[01:43:15.920 --> 01:43:20.480]   because that always bums me out but i love that we that right now the imagination is a limit about
[01:43:20.480 --> 01:43:25.120]   iphone eight we can talk about wireless like total distance charging and infinity displays and all
[01:43:25.120 --> 01:43:29.040]   these things because apple hasn't made it really yet and a minute they do that all in so i would
[01:43:29.040 --> 01:43:34.960]   not give this up for the war i i do like speculating but then we have i mean there's rumors galore in
[01:43:34.960 --> 01:43:41.440]   today's rundown about the iphone eight and there's cases and there's also you know reveals of body
[01:43:41.440 --> 01:43:44.880]   shots and that's one of the things they address by the way that in this meeting about leaks
[01:43:45.520 --> 01:43:49.280]   which was by the way i should explain intended for employees i think to train them
[01:43:49.280 --> 01:43:53.440]   this is why you don't want to leak this is why it's really good for us and good for the company
[01:43:53.440 --> 01:43:58.320]   if you keep your mouth shut if you're a good employee in your smart employee you won't be talking
[01:43:58.320 --> 01:44:02.800]   about this stuff yeah but uh but i think but i at the same so there are a lot and they talk about
[01:44:02.800 --> 01:44:06.320]   the supply chain which is much more difficult control but all the things they're doing they get
[01:44:06.320 --> 01:44:13.520]   moles all sorts of stuff uh but i don't want to be complicit in this i mean a lot of these rumors
[01:44:13.520 --> 01:44:18.480]   like the rumor i mentioned there's just one article yeah like we thought what apple do if they wanted
[01:44:18.480 --> 01:44:23.840]   to announce that's fine that's different right that's not yeah i think rumors rumors are useful if
[01:44:23.840 --> 01:44:30.480]   we don't bring it into the context of if we talk about well if apple what if what what why is that
[01:44:30.480 --> 01:44:34.960]   why is ar important and what would be valuable and what would be nonsense and why people think about
[01:44:34.960 --> 01:44:39.040]   this it's also useful if someone the number of time that any of us in this conversation are asked
[01:44:39.040 --> 01:44:43.280]   hey i know i'm gonna need to buy i'm gonna need to buy a new macbook sometime in the next year and a
[01:44:43.280 --> 01:44:48.880]   half should i but i'd be great if i had it for November should i wait until next year and sometimes
[01:44:48.880 --> 01:44:52.880]   that becomes uh that becomes important part of the conversation but rumors are always just rumors
[01:44:52.880 --> 01:44:57.920]   the other thing you have to be aware of that in my experience very few people will leak something
[01:44:57.920 --> 01:45:03.040]   to you simply because they believe that information wants to be free they usually have some kind of
[01:45:03.040 --> 01:45:09.440]   ulterior motive you cannot i will not share a rumor until i know exactly why this person told me that
[01:45:09.440 --> 01:45:14.080]   if someone told me something without the the bond of this goes no farther this conversation
[01:45:14.080 --> 01:45:18.800]   any context i have to i have to dig and figure out why did this person tell me this thing they're
[01:45:18.800 --> 01:45:25.280]   not supposed to tell me and sometimes when i find when i'm tracking down a rumor that was really
[01:45:25.280 --> 01:45:31.120]   great that someone else published i will track it down and find out that oh his source was actually
[01:45:31.120 --> 01:45:36.320]   inside the company that is saying that it doesn't comment on sources because they because they
[01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:41.600]   because they it was very it was very very advantageous for them to have the news cycle at that point
[01:45:41.600 --> 01:45:48.480]   in time and so they there was an authorized leak of information to make sure that they got a number
[01:45:48.480 --> 01:45:54.480]   of conversations on that Tuesday of that week of that year so that's why it's very very dangerous
[01:45:54.480 --> 01:45:58.800]   to be really really to get interested in rumors also but remember remember the the most famous
[01:45:58.800 --> 01:46:06.480]   leaked of all when an apple engineer lost a pre-release iPhone well okay what what did we
[01:46:06.480 --> 01:46:10.640]   learn from that that apple is going to be introducing a new phone okay we knew they were going to do
[01:46:10.640 --> 01:46:15.360]   it anyway that that phone was going to be of a shape and size that again we knew anyway it was
[01:46:15.360 --> 01:46:19.760]   a different design but it didn't really was it news did actually change anything we didn't know
[01:46:19.760 --> 01:46:25.840]   anything about the context of this we didn't know if it was a sample a sample that was designed to
[01:46:25.840 --> 01:46:31.200]   have no ornamentation whatsoever to so it wouldn't call attention to itself right or was it a sample
[01:46:31.200 --> 01:46:36.640]   designed to this is the thing they're intended to ship and finally the persons who had it they had
[01:46:36.640 --> 01:46:42.400]   the biggest scoop ever which is they have an entire radical change to the to the antenna structure
[01:46:42.400 --> 01:46:47.680]   of this thing and they missed it completely even though they had the thing in their hands so that's
[01:46:47.680 --> 01:46:53.440]   why rumors are again they're fun they're good for topic conversation i'm i'm i'm happy you're talking
[01:46:53.440 --> 01:46:57.920]   about it because talking about a rumor in a podcast because we're having conversation and
[01:46:57.920 --> 01:47:02.000]   i think people understand the conversation it's really hard for me to write about it though because
[01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:05.520]   then you kind of give it a legitimacy that a rumor does not deserve yeah there's a very big
[01:47:05.520 --> 01:47:09.840]   difference in seeing it in print and seeing us just kind of gabbing about it well for instance
[01:47:09.840 --> 01:47:17.040]   here's a supply chain rumor that apples uh next phone will have a 3d sensor module in it kind of
[01:47:17.040 --> 01:47:21.920]   like project tango uh twenty five cents years ago i mean like again a lot of this stuff is you look
[01:47:21.920 --> 01:47:28.400]   at what apples doing and what they need to be surprised right yeah um okay so and and again this
[01:47:28.400 --> 01:47:33.600]   can be fuel for thought about and speculation about well what would that mean what would that
[01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:37.600]   how would that change what to do yeah how would that protect the r's that stuff's always interesting
[01:47:37.600 --> 01:47:42.960]   something's don't like uh famously the sapphire's green was leaked every way which way but then
[01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:49.040]   it didn't ship so like none of this stuff i think we're always really clear and i hope that uh you
[01:47:49.040 --> 01:47:53.840]   listening understand that uh we'll always say it's just a rumor and i think we've said again and
[01:47:53.840 --> 01:47:57.840]   again you know apple prototypes many things you always say that ryan which is great uh that this
[01:47:57.840 --> 01:48:01.520]   doesn't mean this is a product this is something they're working on who knows what that means
[01:48:01.520 --> 01:48:05.920]   till tim or fill or somebody holds it up on stage it's not a real apple product yeah all right let's
[01:48:05.920 --> 01:48:12.720]   take a break picks of the week you ready yes sir all right ready i'm i'll give you my pick uh

[01:50:53.600 --> 01:50:58.800]   was able to wordpress is a standard so there's all sorts of support tools out there and of course
[01:50:58.800 --> 01:51:05.040]   they have their great apps as well wordpress.com/macbreak please try it today
[01:51:05.040 --> 01:51:09.920]   can i do something quickly lio before we get to pick yes so we didn't get a chance to get your
[01:51:09.920 --> 01:51:14.080]   reacts on what apple did with the apple podcast standard or with the podcast format you know what
[01:51:14.080 --> 01:51:19.840]   i didn't bring it up because i don't know enough about it i've saw some uh um tweets about it but i
[01:51:19.840 --> 01:51:24.320]   i you know i just got back and i haven't had a chance to read up on it so they are proposing
[01:51:25.600 --> 01:51:30.080]   what new metadata that will allow you to not like because right now a lot of the podcasts are just
[01:51:30.080 --> 01:51:34.720]   you you subscribe to it and you get the most recent episode and this will let you have episodes and
[01:51:34.720 --> 01:51:39.200]   seasons marked it'll let you decide whether you want them to be reverse chronological or chronological
[01:51:39.200 --> 01:51:44.080]   uh first season or most recent season it'll also let you do things like uh doesn't even episode is
[01:51:44.080 --> 01:51:50.880]   a trailer or as a bonus material like after dark episodes versus regular episodes so it's just a
[01:51:50.880 --> 01:51:56.240]   way to make them a little bit more it's itunes only no they made it's open so anyone complements it and
[01:51:56.240 --> 01:52:01.280]   i think a lot of so you think other podcast apps will take a bit yeah see i've had a problem in the
[01:52:01.280 --> 01:52:07.200]   past because one of the reasons podcasts exist is because of something called rss what a podcast
[01:52:07.200 --> 01:52:12.880]   really is there's no such thing as a podcast it's just audio or video programming that you can
[01:52:12.880 --> 01:52:19.280]   that has a feed an rss feed you can subscribe to and it's all because dave liner in 2004
[01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:26.160]   added a little feature to the standard there is an rss standard that said there's a binary file
[01:52:26.160 --> 01:52:33.680]   enclosure audio or video enclosure in this feed so you can use an rss reader to subscribe to the rss
[01:52:33.680 --> 01:52:37.840]   feed when there's a new show you automatically download it and that's really the fundamental
[01:52:37.840 --> 01:52:42.320]   technology the power at all podcast but it is a standard when apple's itunes a couple of years
[01:52:42.320 --> 01:52:47.840]   later implemented podcasting they added new fields they changed the standard to an apple specific
[01:52:47.840 --> 01:52:52.240]   standard we all kind of went along because that was really the only way people could easily listen
[01:52:52.240 --> 01:53:00.640]   to podcast was through itunes i'm very nervous about apple unilaterally setting a standard
[01:53:00.640 --> 01:53:06.400]   admittedly everybody could follow it but it makes me very nervous there's also audience metrics in
[01:53:06.400 --> 01:53:10.480]   there i think that's separate so you can log into your itunes account you'll be able to get the
[01:53:10.480 --> 01:53:14.320]   same kind of analytics that developers get for their app so for example you can find out that
[01:53:14.320 --> 01:53:17.600]   when i start talking everyone stops listening and then have a very serious conversation with
[01:53:17.600 --> 01:53:22.960]   yes it makes me very nervous because i you know i never even want to call a podcast i don't want
[01:53:22.960 --> 01:53:28.400]   this to live in the apple universe exclusive of everything else well in some shows have very low
[01:53:28.400 --> 01:53:34.800]   apple like apple users in some podcasts have very high and people often look at the uh the charts on
[01:53:34.800 --> 01:53:41.280]   itunes and say oh you're not in the charts anymore and uh and it's it's a long boring explanation
[01:53:41.920 --> 01:53:47.360]   about how the charts work and the fact that not everybody uses itunes etc etc etc
[01:53:47.360 --> 01:53:52.640]   um you can you can be as we are one of the most listened to podcasts in the world and not be on
[01:53:52.640 --> 01:53:57.600]   the charts that has nothing to do with it the charts reflect new subscriptions in the past week yeah
[01:53:57.600 --> 01:54:02.080]   in fact the older the podcast is the less likely you're going to be on charts because you're not
[01:54:02.080 --> 01:54:06.000]   going to get as many new subscriptions as a brand new podcast we would always be number one when
[01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:09.840]   this show launched we'd always number one on the chart because everybody subscribes to it and then
[01:54:09.840 --> 01:54:14.480]   it would fall off the episode ranks especially and so that drives me crazy because nobody
[01:54:14.480 --> 01:54:18.160]   understands that and i don't want to have to explain that every time and so we get people say
[01:54:18.160 --> 01:54:23.920]   well you're not you know the number one podcast is this american life well yeah but that's not the
[01:54:23.920 --> 01:54:30.880]   most listened to necessarily so um okay so they're going to add ah makes me makes me nervous will we
[01:54:30.880 --> 01:54:35.760]   are you guys supporting it of course you are uh i would so if we're doing we do a very traditional
[01:54:35.760 --> 01:54:39.920]   podcast it doesn't really need any of these feeds i think it's mostly for things like cereal uh
[01:54:39.920 --> 01:54:44.320]   well remember they had an enhanced for a long time there was this enhanced thing you could put
[01:54:44.320 --> 01:54:49.680]   chapter marks and all that stuff i didn't do that because again it was ipod and i i just huge in
[01:54:49.680 --> 01:54:53.600]   Germany like you get so many requests from germans for that feature it's amazing whether they are
[01:54:53.600 --> 01:54:58.320]   orderly people we like to know but the chapter is like is it a song or is it an album i just i
[01:54:58.320 --> 01:55:03.200]   gotta figure that out yeah uh you're right it doesn't we don't have seasons we don't have bonus
[01:55:03.200 --> 01:55:09.760]   content uh we don't do trailers so some of those features are less useful but i get very nervous
[01:55:09.760 --> 01:55:16.000]   when i see a big company like apple start to get in the analytics field uh because that is going to
[01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:22.160]   hurt us uh a small percentage of our stuff this show probably is most apple listeners but a lot
[01:55:22.160 --> 01:55:27.040]   of our stuff doesn't have a lot of apple listeners yep i don't want to be reliant on any company for
[01:55:27.040 --> 01:55:33.600]   that kind of information so i'm just when i when i see stuff like this i'm just get worried about
[01:55:33.600 --> 01:55:39.760]   the business not being driven by people who want to do things that are cool and inventive
[01:55:39.760 --> 01:55:44.960]   and people that now want to do things that there is a proven they're proven analytics that there are
[01:55:44.960 --> 01:55:50.240]   listeners for this type of show i don't i want podcasts to continue to be really really weird
[01:55:50.240 --> 01:55:55.520]   i agree people can't support and most of the podcasts out there they're not people who are
[01:55:55.520 --> 01:56:00.480]   making six figures a year doing this podcast it's people who are very very happy that all their
[01:56:00.480 --> 01:56:05.360]   expenses of expenses of of production are being covered and maybe they can go out to hear a couple
[01:56:05.360 --> 01:56:10.400]   times a month too but maybe that would go away if someone was saying we noticed that during those
[01:56:10.400 --> 01:56:14.800]   10 minutes where you talked about Wonder Woman and argued whether it was if it was a prequel to the
[01:56:14.800 --> 01:56:20.000]   Justice League movement a lot of people tuned out and i when you joined our podcast network you said
[01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:24.240]   that you would have us as co-producers were telling you that we would much rather you not talk about
[01:56:24.240 --> 01:56:27.840]   that sort of stuff to remember you know that's the last thing i never want to see and it would be
[01:56:27.840 --> 01:56:32.640]   the kiss of death for podcasting frankly it would kill it but you know professional broadcasters
[01:56:32.640 --> 01:56:36.400]   gave that kind of permission all the time i remember on the screen savers tivo offered us
[01:56:36.400 --> 01:56:42.240]   a graph you could see how when people paused and rewind and everything of every second of the show
[01:56:42.240 --> 01:56:48.560]   and that fortunately tech tv didn't buy that uh because that would that's not what you want to do
[01:56:48.560 --> 01:56:56.640]   in my opinion uh but the problem is and and this is really inside baseball but when advertisers
[01:56:56.640 --> 01:57:01.760]   see this they go oh good so we're going to have those analytics and and big media sees it says
[01:57:01.760 --> 01:57:08.480]   oh good and it can kind of hurt us you know makes our ad sales harder for instance no we're not
[01:57:08.480 --> 01:57:12.720]   going to support those and we're not going to give you those analytics well no but we want them and
[01:57:12.720 --> 01:57:17.840]   so all of these things i don't want in any way to spy on what our users are doing if they download
[01:57:17.840 --> 01:57:22.240]   the show i'm happy uh it's up to you whether you listen to it whether you pause with the skip
[01:57:22.240 --> 01:57:26.800]   any whether you skip me that's none of my business and i don't as long as you don't skip me no don't
[01:57:26.800 --> 01:57:30.720]   skip your name whatever you're supposed to be able to skip a ball yeah i'm glad you brought it up i
[01:57:30.720 --> 01:57:36.160]   didn't i haven't really spent a lot of time with it i my initial reaction is i don't like that but
[01:57:36.160 --> 01:57:42.560]   we'll have to see and i bet you will probably pay attention to it because apple's so powerful
[01:57:42.560 --> 01:57:45.040]   when you do the musical theater show leos is going to need this
[01:57:46.480 --> 01:57:51.600]   uh and can do they add some support for that show that they had the ability to subscribe as well
[01:57:51.600 --> 01:57:55.840]   i uh well that i don't believe anything has changed with that okay and they didn't talk
[01:57:55.840 --> 01:58:00.400]   of some people were asking about page and feed too and they have no comment on that as well okay
[01:58:00.400 --> 01:58:06.160]   now our picks that's not my pick of the week now our picks of the week
[01:58:06.160 --> 01:58:12.000]   right why don't you start Renee go ahead all right so my pick of the week uh we mentioned it earlier
[01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:17.360]   and the new ipad's now they're both identical except for the size and the bigger one doesn't get rose
[01:58:17.360 --> 01:58:21.760]   gold which is another thing that's irks into me but uh they both now have not just the fast
[01:58:21.760 --> 01:58:25.760]   data transfer but they both have the fast charging option i wish apple would put this in the box
[01:58:25.760 --> 01:58:29.920]   because it would make the pro really pro but right now it's it's you can go buy it on your own and
[01:58:29.920 --> 01:58:34.320]   once you use it i think you're really gonna find value in it because it charges the ipad pro around
[01:58:34.320 --> 01:58:41.520]   twice as fast as the usual uh usb-a uh dongle so you do need a usb-c to lightning cable which you
[01:58:41.520 --> 01:58:45.920]   can also multitask and use that with your iphone or your ipad plugging it into your new macbook pro
[01:58:45.920 --> 01:58:52.240]   or macbook but then you get the 29 watt charging brick that's usb-c you plug that in and zoom zoom
[01:58:52.240 --> 01:58:56.880]   that the previous hour long ordeal and calling it an ideal in the most privileged sense of the word
[01:58:56.880 --> 01:59:01.760]   or deal goes down to just a couple hours why don't they ship that with the ipad pro i don't i don't know
[01:59:01.760 --> 01:59:04.880]   it's probably it would probably add like three bucks of the bill of goods and it destroys everybody's
[01:59:04.880 --> 01:59:09.360]   math and people cry i don't i don't know the answer i hope they do um hopefully we're just a year away
[01:59:09.360 --> 01:59:14.400]   from a becoming standard maybe uh because they're all obviously all in on usb-c on the max let's be
[01:59:14.400 --> 01:59:19.520]   all in on usb-c everywhere uh because consistency is a user facing feature but you can buy it separately
[01:59:19.520 --> 01:59:23.360]   it's like 19 bucks i think for the power brick or a little bit more for that and that's not that
[01:59:23.360 --> 01:59:28.880]   your bucks for the cable so they could charge a lot more all right yeah and it's uh it really is fast
[01:59:28.880 --> 01:59:32.320]   and again you can use that cable to plug into a macbook pro or a macbook if you have it so you're
[01:59:32.320 --> 01:59:36.880]   getting more out of it than just the charging i guess you were wondering that's like what dongles
[01:59:36.880 --> 01:59:42.720]   should i get i by the way i just my review of the uh of and i've only had it for a few days
[01:59:42.720 --> 01:59:47.120]   it's nice to have this extra real estate but really if you have an ipad pro already you
[01:59:47.120 --> 01:59:52.880]   probably be just happy with that and 9.7 yeah it's very similar just it's a slightly more expansive
[01:59:52.880 --> 01:59:56.720]   keyboard the 12.9 got a much more significant upgrade because it didn't have any of that
[01:59:56.720 --> 02:00:01.360]   screen technology and it didn't have uh the can like it's cameras with the ipad ear two cameras
[02:00:01.360 --> 02:00:05.600]   which still make me cry yeah isn't that sad i did see somebody in the airplane with an ipad
[02:00:06.400 --> 02:00:10.880]   12 you know the big one i was like that thing is huge they were a bunch on my flight and they were
[02:00:10.880 --> 02:00:14.960]   playing like three people with those playing candy crush on the bonnie i don't think that's a thing
[02:00:14.960 --> 02:00:20.720]   12.9 inches of candy crush all right so which dongles i get to go to the
[02:00:20.720 --> 02:00:25.920]   yes store now which dongles do you recommend uh it depends it depends a lot on your use case i
[02:00:25.920 --> 02:00:31.120]   would get that charger and i would also get the usb uh three dongle because if you ever want to
[02:00:31.120 --> 02:00:34.960]   plug it in it's got a pass through so you can charge with it so you can plug in things like other
[02:00:34.960 --> 02:00:40.720]   keyboards podcast mics uh you know almost any usb-a device that you want to once you get that
[02:00:40.720 --> 02:00:45.600]   and then if you ever want to do hdmi out you can get an hdmi out an hdmi dog known as well
[02:00:45.600 --> 02:00:49.760]   see it's really kind of frustrating that store.apple.com doesn't
[02:00:49.760 --> 02:00:54.640]   doesn't go anywhere that i can actually say where's the existence the redesign
[02:00:54.640 --> 02:00:58.640]   you can search for usbc ipad in the corner and uh that's not the best card
[02:00:58.640 --> 02:01:03.920]   there needs there needs to be a top level button for here is where you go if you want to look at
[02:01:03.920 --> 02:01:07.360]   find a brick and mortar apple store here is where you go if you want to
[02:01:07.360 --> 02:01:11.120]   treat this like an online store and not just go through product pages and then click
[02:01:11.120 --> 02:01:15.360]   a buy it here i want to give you money button just that's i would be so helpful here if i if i
[02:01:15.360 --> 02:01:20.240]   hold up my credit card to the camera can i prove that just you can verify they do have enough money
[02:01:20.240 --> 02:01:27.280]   they do have to admit that hdmi dongle apple pay it's a really dangerous thing because i i was on
[02:01:27.280 --> 02:01:33.040]   the plane we had the plane just landed i turned on my phone oh my god ordered i did not i had not
[02:01:33.040 --> 02:01:38.160]   exited the plane when i ordered the ipad pro and just did my fingerprint i said that was easy
[02:01:38.160 --> 02:01:45.680]   that's 800 bucks i'll never see yep that's so unfair no matter how bad like on plane wifi is
[02:01:45.680 --> 02:01:51.520]   or or public wifi it's always just fast enough for to buy stuff it's never fast enough to be distracted
[02:01:51.520 --> 02:01:56.400]   from buying stuff because you're working at pictures or in video oh wait so wait a minute now i don't
[02:01:56.400 --> 02:02:01.280]   know what i'm getting here this is this really got to work on this yeah so you want the usb c to
[02:02:01.280 --> 02:02:04.720]   lightning cable because that's what's going to connect to the power brick okay and then you want
[02:02:04.720 --> 02:02:09.280]   me where i want the one meter because yes yes because i'm all metric now what
[02:02:09.280 --> 02:02:14.560]   now you want the usb c uh 29 watt usb c yeah shop accessories and then you can
[02:02:14.560 --> 02:02:25.440]   award this is a terrible store i mean seriously apple chargers top left but hey if you could flip
[02:02:25.440 --> 02:02:30.400]   that page around and see how well the back of that page was painted so i will impress with it so i
[02:02:30.400 --> 02:02:37.680]   want to use the usb adapter no uh no i want to know you want the 25 watt power
[02:02:37.680 --> 02:02:42.880]   29 watt yeah that one yes that's 50 bucks dude what you say 90 that is 50 bucks sorry well the cable
[02:02:42.880 --> 02:02:48.960]   is 19 the cables 25 wow you canadians sorry i'm going to get a special deal now what's the
[02:02:48.960 --> 02:02:54.640]   i could swear i looked at the other day and it was 19 bucks no they they saw me coming they they know
[02:02:54.640 --> 02:02:59.760]   all theos ordering give it put an extra six bucks in here and then what about a card reader they have
[02:02:59.760 --> 02:03:06.080]   that they have they have a usb three card reader and a usb three to um uh to uh what's the color
[02:03:06.080 --> 02:03:11.840]   there's a USB three camera adapter yes and that's nice because it has a power port as well yes
[02:03:11.840 --> 02:03:17.200]   okay so but that doesn't have a card reader you just put a regular card reader on there
[02:03:17.200 --> 02:03:22.000]   you you can get a card reader too they have a card reader that's fine but this one they this
[02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:26.480]   one will let you connect to a whole range of peripherals well that's only a hundred twenty
[02:03:26.480 --> 02:03:35.040]   two dollars additional yeah that's expensive being an apple customer
[02:03:35.040 --> 02:03:40.320]   just just that's okay just like what what's the keynote have phil explained to you how much you
[02:03:40.320 --> 02:03:43.920]   would have to pay for all this if you bought things separately that's what a great value this is this
[02:03:43.920 --> 02:03:51.120]   is a great value thank you phil so the lightning to usb three camera adapter the 29 watt usb
[02:03:51.120 --> 02:03:57.920]   c power adapter and the usb c to lightning cable yes because i'll be plugging that into the power
[02:03:57.920 --> 02:04:01.920]   adapter to charge it yes or into your new macbook era or macbook right so i'm not big
[02:04:01.920 --> 02:04:09.600]   care backbook or macbook pro it's getting this is now getting closer to a pc so again i i really
[02:04:09.600 --> 02:04:12.960]   think that they should have that adapter in the box and that the lightning to usb cable should
[02:04:12.960 --> 02:04:17.680]   do usb three anyway i don't understand why we have all this rigor roll yes i don't even feel like i
[02:04:17.680 --> 02:04:21.680]   don't even feel like i've ordered the right thing and i had rene richie looking over my shoulder
[02:04:21.680 --> 02:04:27.680]   telling me what to order and i don't know if i got the right thing yeah and an echo your pick of
[02:04:27.680 --> 02:04:35.440]   the week uh really cheap really simple you can go to amazon or ebay and buy like 10 sim tray extractor
[02:04:35.440 --> 02:04:40.960]   tools for like a buck and here's why here's why here's why i'm telling you that's such a great
[02:04:40.960 --> 02:04:46.640]   idea that it arrives in the mail again you'll just get this envelope probably from china with these
[02:04:46.640 --> 02:04:50.720]   little sim extractor tools at that point you take out your wallet you put one in your wallet and then
[02:04:50.720 --> 02:04:56.400]   you drop one in your laptop bag you you give a couple to your wife you give every single place
[02:04:56.400 --> 02:05:02.560]   where you might have we have might have a bag or an accessory that is on you at a point where you
[02:05:02.560 --> 02:05:07.600]   wish you had a sim extractor have a sim extractor on you it's like it's it's not it's not quite like
[02:05:07.600 --> 02:05:13.200]   having a gun every place in the in your in your your stronghold in case you're caught on her wares
[02:05:13.200 --> 02:05:18.080]   but how many times do you actually need a sim extractor almost never but when you do there's
[02:05:18.080 --> 02:05:22.720]   nothing that will take the place that tool and the reason why i carry one in my wallet is number one
[02:05:22.720 --> 02:05:27.840]   because that one time every year or two when i literally generally buy a new phone it is such a
[02:05:27.840 --> 02:05:33.440]   small item i will never find where i put it when i put it away the last time but if it's always in
[02:05:33.440 --> 02:05:37.520]   my wallet then i know where it is it's in my wallet because you're talking about something that weighs
[02:05:37.520 --> 02:05:43.760]   i don't know what a gram maybe it's just it's the it's not even metal almost it's so thin so it's
[02:05:43.760 --> 02:05:47.680]   just trivially easy to keep with you and then you never know when you're in it's you'll be in a
[02:05:47.680 --> 02:05:54.400]   situation where the battery in your phone is dead but you also you can swap phones with somebody if
[02:05:54.400 --> 02:05:59.840]   you can just swap sims just for just for an hour you can still get done what you need to get done by
[02:05:59.840 --> 02:06:05.760]   messaging people on your phone that's the situation i was in in new york a couple weeks ago where i did
[02:06:05.760 --> 02:06:09.840]   have a battery with me that i could have just plugged it into but i was also walking around with
[02:06:09.840 --> 02:06:14.800]   a second phone that i was testing and i decided that well this has a fully charged like 4 000
[02:06:14.800 --> 02:06:20.240]   million dollar battery inside it i can either do a sim swap in in about a minute and not have to
[02:06:20.240 --> 02:06:26.240]   walk around with this pair of nunchucks in my hands at all times i think that's what i'll do so but
[02:06:26.240 --> 02:06:30.320]   mostly it's so that no matter when you need to get your hands on a sim it will always be there with
[02:06:30.320 --> 02:06:35.440]   you and the next time you legitimately need to use a sim you will not have to worry where it is do
[02:06:35.440 --> 02:06:40.480]   it once put it in your wallet forget about it and then when you realize it oh you'll only remember
[02:06:40.480 --> 02:06:46.000]   it later on when you realize it oh i'm not screwed i happen to have a sim extraction tool on me right
[02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:55.280]   now end the scourge of bent paper clips you can't i can't i'm that's he that's a star really funny
[02:06:55.280 --> 02:07:01.440]   paper clip is a terrible thing to waste well there was a time where i had like a a dvd drive that
[02:07:01.440 --> 02:07:06.480]   something was stuck and you need to eject it i could not find a single paper clip anywhere inside my
[02:07:06.480 --> 02:07:10.880]   house i was going through like old boxes the same maybe somebody when they sent me when they sent
[02:07:10.880 --> 02:07:15.520]   me when they sent them anymore the two thousand the two thousand laptop maybe i'm lucky and they
[02:07:15.520 --> 02:07:21.680]   sent me like the fedex return thing paper clip to like a pr thing i could not find some
[02:07:21.680 --> 02:07:30.800]   maybe we should say instead of buying 10 sim card pushers for a dollar a dollar nine plus free
[02:07:30.800 --> 02:07:36.560]   shipping buy a box of paper clips they do more they don't well they don't fit inside the sim
[02:07:36.560 --> 02:07:41.440]   hole and also i don't know i'm jamming something too big inside there that's a good that's a that's
[02:07:41.440 --> 02:07:45.840]   a hell of a way to thank the design team at apple for building this incredibly gorgeous thing
[02:07:45.840 --> 02:07:52.400]   say come on i have i have a sim i have a sim poker in on my keychain that's how important it is yeah
[02:07:52.400 --> 02:07:55.360]   mine stabs me in the leg all the time but i never take it off i have it everywhere
[02:07:55.360 --> 02:07:58.960]   that's the messy drawer that's where that goes
[02:07:58.960 --> 02:08:07.840]   look at that you can get 12 boxes of jumbo silver paper clips 12,000 paper clips okay it's the fun
[02:08:07.840 --> 02:08:11.680]   thing about paper clips because you never actually had these before you can make chains out of them
[02:08:11.680 --> 02:08:16.720]   and you can twist them into little animals and you can you can like take a lit match and turn
[02:08:16.720 --> 02:08:20.160]   into like a little bottle rocket use that as a launcher for the little lit match bottle rocket
[02:08:20.160 --> 02:08:23.840]   next week we'll teach you how to make a bottle rocket of a lit match and it'll be some thin foil
