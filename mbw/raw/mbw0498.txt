[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   A little salt in a little crypto talk.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   The president says we're fetishizing our phones, really.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   And there's a whole lot more, including one more attempt to crack the iPhone security that
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   fails.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   It's all ahead next.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   Let's go back break weekly.

[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   Andy Inako is on assignment in Yosemite.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Lucky guy, he's a cocoa con and apparently has no internet access.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   Why aren't you there, Renee Richie?
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   I don't get invited to the fancy stuff.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   That's why we have Strandie Caldwell on board.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   She's there.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Yes.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   It's great to have you from iMore.com.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Also joining us, Alex Lindsay from the Pixel Core.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   Hey, Alex.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Hello.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   In his secure bunker somewhere deep beneath the...
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   I don't know what.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   I don't think it's deep until you get to 35 feet.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   So right now, it's still near the surface.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Lava doesn't start in Minecraft until level 10.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   Right.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   Right.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Exactly.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Hey, Lukus.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   You're filling in for Andy Inako.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   It's great to see him.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Clayton Morris, our good buddy, Clayton Morris.com.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Clayton Morris, you got a bunch of new podcasts too, of course, Fox and Friends every weekend.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   What's the new podcast?
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Oh, it's a podcast I do about empowerment.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Well, I kind of had a rough patch last year, but sort of a reevaluation of things that you're
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   doing in your life and what you're chasing after and why you're doing certain things.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Man, you're chasing your dreams.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   Yeah, but then you look at and you're like, am I doing this to make money?
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   I know that you're doing this because I really want to live a life.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   That's valuable and meaningful.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   So what happens when you have kids, isn't it?
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Right.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.200]   The podcast is called Empower and I just interview people who, people like Byron Katie and Deepak
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.320]   Chopra and things like that where, you know, we kind of drill in deep about the fears that
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.200]   people face and the things that hold us back and limiting beliefs.
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.840]   So that's, you know, it's really like a sort of a self help kind of it more help me out
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:20.840]   than anything else.
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:21.840]   Help me.
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:22.840]   Yeah.
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.520]   So just before the show, Patrick De La Jand, he came in one of our great guys, a programmer,
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.840]   writes a lot of our software.
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:37.320]   It said, you know, you can unlock an iPhone without any prior knowledge of the code.
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.920]   We should pass this along to the FBI.
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:39.920]   Yeah.
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:40.920]   I thought this was debunked.
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:47.720]   We also had the video, but then people with, you know, like I'm more said, well, no, no,
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.320]   no, the guy's clearly unlocking it while he's doing this procedure.
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.200]   So Renee, can you walk me through this on my iPhone?
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.520]   Let's see if we can do it.
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:57.520]   I just tried.
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.760]   I couldn't do it, but I'm on the latest beta.
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:59.760]   You might be different.
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:00.760]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.360]   No, this is stock, so to speak.
[00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.200]   So I'm just going to procedure.
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.800]   Let's do it because because we're going to walk through it right now.
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.240]   So show the close up of my phone.
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.240]   How do I?
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.240]   Okay.
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.240]   See, it's locked.
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.240]   See?
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.460]   So I'm not going to use my, I'm not going to use a finger that would unlock it.
[00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:19.360]   This doesn't unlock it.
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.800]   So that's the good news.
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:21.800]   All right.
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.520]   Now, so the first thing I'm going to do is going to get Siri going.
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.520]   What am I going to ask her?
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.520]   What time is it?
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.320]   Yes.
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.560]   What time is it?
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:36.440]   Now, now this works if you allow Siri, by the way, the simple fix for this would be turn
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.040]   off Siri and lockspray, right?
[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.040]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.520]   But I allow it because I want to be able to ask things like what time is it?
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:43.520]   Now what do I do now?
[00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:44.520]   Touch the clock.
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.960]   Tap the clock to get into the alarm clock program.
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.640]   And now I want to add ringtones.
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.800]   So you go to timer at the bottom tab.
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:52.800]   The timer tab.
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.600]   Now I'm still not touching the fingerprint reader.
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.600]   Watch that.
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.320]   You want to just click on when timer ends.
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:58.320]   When timer ends radar.
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.000]   No, no, I want to buy more tones, baby.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.160]   I said I want to buy more tones, baby.
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.160]   That's what I get to it.
[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.160]   It just looks at me and laughs.
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.080]   Patrick says he was able to get this to open.
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.680]   But I say I'm worried that people are inadvertently unlocking it.
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:12.680]   Yeah.
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:13.680]   This is the thing.
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.680]   And Apple did have to fix this or no.
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.320]   I haven't seen any records when fixing.
[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:21.960]   I mean, lockscreen bypasses are so common because the lockscreen has an impossible job.
[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.800]   It's meant to keep the phone secure but provide you with all manner of convenience as in
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:30.600]   sometimes those conflicting those create edge cases that allow people to get through.
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:31.600]   What time is it?
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.600]   Let's try one more time just to see.
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:34.600]   Yeah.
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:35.600]   The time will be two twenty seven.
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:36.600]   Yeah.
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:37.600]   Yeah.
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:38.600]   I'm going to open it.
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:39.600]   Oops.
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.600]   And I'm going to go to timer.
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.400]   And I'm going to say when timer ends buy more tones.
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.400]   Yeah.
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.400]   See.
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.400]   Anybody hear it?
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.400]   Some people in the audience are trying.
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.400]   No.
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.400]   Was anybody able to do it?
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:50.400]   No.
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.400]   No.
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.400]   No.
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.640]   You can't get it to happen again either.
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.760]   Well, he did show me once.
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.920]   It's really hard because the new touch ID two cents are so fast you could lock it without
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.160]   really realizing it.
[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.160]   Right.
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.160]   All right.
[00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.560]   So sorry FBI didn't mean to get your hopes up.
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.600]   Oh, they could jailbreak their way in or they give the NSA.
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:13.880]   You know, that's the latest thing is we're all we're all assuming that the NSA has zero
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:14.880]   days.
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:15.880]   Nobody knows for sure.
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:19.640]   Although, you know Snowden said they do, but that was old stuff, right?
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:23.400]   I mean, the jailbreak community has zero days because they're continuing to jailbreak
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.400]   stuff.
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.920]   So you can jailbreak any iPhone right now without having an unlock?
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:31.000]   I don't know what it goes up to, but I mean, I think it's goes past what and I might be
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   wrong.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   You're going to apologize.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.280]   But I think it goes past what is currently installed on that iPhone.
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:38.640]   Does this mean that McAfee has to doesn't have to eat his shoe?
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:43.680]   Well, if you didn't know that he was right, does that count?
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:48.640]   And then the other thing I've seen, which I think is verified is that the secure on.
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:53.440]   So when you try 10 times to unlock an iPhone and it's set to erase, it doesn't erase the
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:54.440]   phone.
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.440]   It merely erases the crypto key.
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:57.440]   Yes.
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.720]   Because then, of course, the phone is scrambled with no key.
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.200]   There's nothing anybody can do to read it.
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:04.680]   And the key is backed up in the secure on Clive, right?
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.480]   There is stored in the secure on.
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:07.480]   And it is possible.
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:10.680]   Is it not to back up the secure on Clive?
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.280]   I don't think you back up.
[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.800]   I'll make a copy there.
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.040]   You have to open the phone to do it, I believe.
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:20.840]   I don't know if anyone's proven that you can do it without damaging what's stored on there.
[00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.560]   And I certainly haven't done it.
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.080]   So I don't want to say authoritatively.
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:25.240]   You can or you can't.
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.960]   That was one of the things for debate.
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:31.000]   That was one of the, yeah, this is the problem is that all of the, all of the backdoors at
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.040]   the FBI supposedly could have used.
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:37.480]   Nobody's really, we don't know for sure.
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:38.480]   So Clayton, you've been good.
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:45.360]   You've been challenging these guys, districts, attorneys and others, on Fox and Friends.
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.040]   Tell me about those conversations because I haven't seen them.
[00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:53.800]   Well what's remarkable is they sort of get out and bloviate in the press for a few days
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:58.760]   and all these Apple insider linking to it, then it makes the mainstream media.
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:04.440]   And for instance, Maricopa County, I think it was the county attorney in Maricopa County.
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:11.200]   And of course, Maricopa County, famous for its sheriff and ridiculous ways.
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:16.760]   I think isn't it Maricopa County where they have the inmates wear pink, pink thongs, like
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:19.840]   that sheriff, that particular sheriff down there?
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:20.840]   Where is that?
[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:21.840]   Sheriff Joe Pye.
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:25.160]   I mean, I sure, yeah, Joe Arpaio, Joe Arpaio.
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.640]   It's in Arizona, the crazy sheriff in Arizona, we all know.
[00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:31.120]   And after this segment aired, and there was so many people that wrote to me, so it's crazy
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.120]   down here in Maricopa County.
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:33.800]   But anyway, they just get on and bloviate.
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:41.160]   So for instance, that district attorney basically said he was not going to buy any more new
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:44.040]   iPhones for his staff, or they're not allowed to.
[00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:46.440]   They're not allowed to even go out and buy it themselves.
[00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:50.560]   So just asking him, you know, well, why, what other phones would you then use?
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:55.640]   You know, he couldn't answer that because they're all vulnerable to the same.
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:09:01.240]   Actually, any with anything phone, forget anything would be vulnerable if government
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:07.320]   agencies were allowed to require tech companies to write a firmware, malicious firmware that
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:08.320]   would allow them to get in.
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.160]   I mean, there's nothing that could there's no defense against that.
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:13.000]   And of course, the insanity is if I wasn't running the government agency, I would want
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.440]   to be on the most secure thing that I had.
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:16.440]   Right.
[00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:17.440]   That's the question.
[00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:19.600]   I said, what was the response of your employees?
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:24.280]   Basically you're telling them that they have to use a less secure phone.
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:26.000]   They're handling all of the county business.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.440]   You want them on the, like the most, like least secure version of iOS that you could probably
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.520]   get your hands on or that roll it back.
[00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:33.520]   It's insane.
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:36.440]   What has been the response of your employees letting you know, that's right.
[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:40.520]   I want to rally around this, you know, this district attorney so that I can, I know that
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:44.360]   my company and my, the county can get access to any data on my phone at any time.
[00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:48.760]   And of course, I mean, the sheriff of America, Copa County is kind of an easy target.
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:50.240]   The president of the United States, a little tougher.
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:54.200]   And he said at South by Southwest too bad because he had a good message.
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:55.200]   He was doing great.
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:58.600]   He said, we want the tech community to work with us to make government more efficient,
[00:09:58.600 --> 00:09:59.760]   more transparent.
[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:01.920]   We want, we really need you guys to help us out.
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:04.160]   This is the code for America pitch.
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:08.640]   And then in the question and answer session afterwards, the moderator quite rightly asks
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:09.520]   him about the encryption thing.
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:11.680]   And he, and then he blows the whole thing.
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:14.440]   He says, well, I'm sure we can work something out.
[00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:17.280]   Let's not fetishize smart phones.
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:20.360]   There has to be a reasonable compromise.
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:23.640]   And I'm sure that the tech folks sitting in the audience went, oh, well, the hell with
[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:28.760]   that, I'm not working with you because this is a hot button topic for tech people.
[00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:33.680]   But I also think that it's a miss, what happens is in politicians misunderstand.
[00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:36.280]   I look politics is the art of compromise and negotiation.
[00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:37.280]   I understand that.
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:42.200]   And that's of course his point of view is there's nothing that we can't work out if people
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.920]   of good will sit down at the table and negotiate.
[00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:47.440]   But they make these straw man arguments, right?
[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:51.920]   Well, but the problem is that math is not negotiable and encryption exists.
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:54.560]   And we have people 3D printing TSA keys now.
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:55.560]   Yeah.
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:11:00.960]   So because, because encryption is, is well known, public key crypto, the methodology is
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:01.960]   well known.
[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:03.200]   It can be written on a t-shirt.
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:06.440]   There's a guy with a tattoo.
[00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:10.000]   It's not something that you, you know, the genies left that bottle.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:16.040]   So the only way you could, you know, you could prevent people from getting encryption
[00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:17.720]   is by outlawing it.
[00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:22.080]   And we've seen the, there's no question about the consequence of that because this happened
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:25.560]   in the crypto wars in the 90s.
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.600]   And Stephen Levy writes a great piece in medium.
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.440]   It was fantastic.
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:30.440]   But I've been saying this too.
[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:37.920]   I remember those, those old folks remember when strong encryption was considered munitions.
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:40.080]   It was classified by the government as munitions.
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:46.080]   And they said, you can't export it as if, you know, it's a box that you can't, sorry,
[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:47.920]   you can't leave the borders.
[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:49.320]   And people made it on t-shirts.
[00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:50.760]   And so, you know, wrote the code on t-shirts.
[00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:53.480]   And now we have exploit because people are really after those weekend.
[00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:54.560]   Well, that's exactly right.
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:59.440]   What happened was Netscape said, all right, I guess we can't make a browser with 256
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:05.760]   or 128-bit SSL will make it with 40-bit encryption because they couldn't make one browser for
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:07.360]   the US and one browser for the rest of the world.
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:11.200]   So Netscape had 40-bit, which meant SSL had to support 40-bit.
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:19.640]   And to this day, 20 years later, we're still insecure because so many websites support 40-bit
[00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:23.040]   encryption, which is easily cracked by modern computers.
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:26.520]   So and if you look at Russia, I was talking to someone from Moscow actually at South
[00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:27.520]   by Southwest.
[00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:31.960]   And, you know, if you look at Russia, Russia is, of course, very upset about Telegram and
[00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:34.760]   hasn't made Telegram any less popular.
[00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:39.840]   Yeah, I really, as Telegram has crappy encryption, they should support Telegram.
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:43.840]   It's the problem is the other stuff using OTR and strong encryption likes, you know,
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:50.000]   signal and the secret and the three-ma and I can go on and on and wire.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.880]   And the problem is these are made by wires from Switzerland.
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:56.440]   So now we got a pass along on Switzerland or, and this is the thing that really scares
[00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:58.840]   me, I'm afraid, Clayton, this is what's going to happen.
[00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:03.040]   Congress is going to step in and pass a law against strong encryption.
[00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:07.760]   This is like the clipper chip, which the NSA invented, which is a chip with a backdoor.
[00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:11.880]   And then no American company will be able to make a strong encryption product.
[00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:14.200]   And that's what I'm just arguing.
[00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:17.760]   If this is going to happen, then it needs to happen at the congressional level.
[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:21.520]   You're sort of forcing our hand to go in and write some code that doesn't exist and
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:22.520]   take resources.
[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:27.320]   If this is going to happen, we're currently adhering to the law that is, that is, that
[00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:31.440]   is, that as it stands on the books right now, Congress needs to come up with legislation
[00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:32.520]   that would change that.
[00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:33.960]   Sadly, that would be the case.
[00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:35.200]   But I don't know.
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:38.960]   I think you see the likes of Senator Lindsey Graham and others who now that they've been
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:42.600]   educated about it, and you have Daryl Isa who wrote a great piece and wired a few weeks
[00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:43.600]   ago.
[00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:45.960]   You know, we had him on the show and I think he's great.
[00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:51.840]   I have to say he's been, he's been very in the, in the, in the congressional testimony.
[00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:55.520]   He was very, I thought very good and asked some very tough questions of Director James
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:56.520]   Comey of the FBI.
[00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:59.360]   It's so interesting that you have this sort of reversal.
[00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:05.440]   Where did, where did Republicans and conservatives go on being conservative when it came to personal
[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:07.720]   liberties and personal freedoms?
[00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:08.720]   And there was this reversal.
[00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:12.000]   And I think you had this sort of gut check moment at least a few weeks ago and you saw
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.800]   Daryl Isa and others starting to have a, you know, educating people about it.
[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:18.240]   And you had Lindsey Graham having a change of heart.
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:22.920]   And you're starting to see maybe some shifting back to where conservatives have been.
[00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:28.280]   But the Republican Party has always been the law, the party of law and order.
[00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:33.200]   And so it makes sense that you would support and, and they, and always have support law
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:34.200]   enforcement.
[00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:41.240]   And this is where it gets sticky because law enforcement wants something that I think
[00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:46.800]   history tells us will make us all more vulnerable.
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:47.800]   Right.
[00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:48.800]   It makes us less safe.
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:53.280]   Now, if you're a law and, or if you're a law and order guy, which I am too, I believe,
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:55.680]   I mean, I, this, the laws are what made this country great.
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:15:00.640]   The rule of law is the single thing that makes this country great, in my opinion, because
[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:05.240]   we all agree, if somebody wins an election, whether we like it or not, they're the president.
[00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:09.760]   If a court rules that you have to unlock that, unlock that phone, you know, Tim Cook is not
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:12.120]   going to say no to the Supreme Court.
[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:18.480]   Because if he does, then that over, then that means the right to, for gays to marry, for
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:22.800]   instance, can now be just, well, I don't believe in it.
[00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:26.280]   And so nobody, nobody at Apple is going to say to the Supreme Court, if they say, if
[00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:29.000]   it goes all the way to the Supreme Court and they say, Apple unlock this phone, they will
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.360]   unlock the phone.
[00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:32.360]   If Congress makes a law, they will do it.
[00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:33.680]   They'll have to do it.
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:35.120]   But that makes us less safe.
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:36.120]   And that's the mess.
[00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:37.120]   That's the message.
[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:42.080]   Tim is trying to get everybody to hear is that it is a law and order issue.
[00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:47.000]   And if we look at the average, if we look at the likelihood of the average person being
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:53.360]   affected by terrorism versus their cell phone being hacked, their identity being hacked,
[00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:58.000]   all these other things, while they're not necessarily life threatening, they can turn
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.760]   people around, turn people's lives inside out.
[00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:05.360]   And those are the much more likely things to happen when you're in an insecure environment.
[00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:13.360]   And then it's a horrible thing to happen and the press is intense around it.
[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:16.080]   But it's less likely than a lightning strike.
[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:19.160]   So I don't know if there are secure phones.
[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:22.360]   There's this black phone from Silent Circle.
[00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:25.760]   It is, they say, private by design.
[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:31.920]   Let's assume for a moment, it's based on Android, that it is secure.
[00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:32.920]   What does Congress do?
[00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:33.920]   Banned this in the United States?
[00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:38.480]   Does it do you like urging that to be on developers?
[00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:39.480]   Right.
[00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:43.680]   So the operating system itself now has a secret key.
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:46.040]   But what about apps that are approved by Apple?
[00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:47.640]   Well, okay, I'll tell you this.
[00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:54.120]   If Apple cracks, if Apple does write firmware, the thing that Apple will be asked to write
[00:16:54.120 --> 00:17:00.120]   eventually, they're not being asked to write it yet, is firmware that allows a backdoor
[00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:04.240]   into the phone, because when the phone's being used, it's being used unencrypted.
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:08.480]   Even if you're using Telegram, if you have access to the keyboard, it doesn't matter.
[00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:13.760]   So what they'll be asked to do is create firmware that allows government to tap it with a
[00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:17.400]   court order, tap into the phone at any time.
[00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:22.440]   And that means I don't care what you use, three, whatever, if you're typing on the keyboard.
[00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:27.480]   So then the app developers have to convince Apple, which Apple can't do, to have a private
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:30.640]   keyboard, but Apple won't do that because they're not allowed to.
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:33.440]   So this doesn't protect apps.
[00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:39.520]   You'd have to use a hardware platform that isn't compromised by US law enforcement or
[00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:41.520]   law enforcement in any other country.
[00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:42.520]   Is it never an official?
[00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:47.840]   I guess the question I'm asking is, is it possible, is it possible for Congress to shut
[00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:49.200]   the door on encryption?
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:54.760]   Well, and I think that also the other question is, is it possible for Apple to move out of
[00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:55.760]   the country?
[00:17:55.760 --> 00:18:02.560]   We should not, we should may sound like a crazy thing unless this really gets intense.
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:03.560]   Does Apple move?
[00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:08.160]   Well, they're going to have to move to Trinidad and Tobago or somewhere because it's going
[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:10.280]   to be somewhere where they're not going to pass a similar law.
[00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:12.680]   And the United States, it's a sphere of influence.
[00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:17.240]   Look at, look at WIPO, the sphere of incidence in the United States is so great that it's
[00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:20.320]   only the smallest, most desperate country.
[00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:23.320]   And if you look at the language that was used in the reply where they said, you know, if
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:27.680]   Apple really finds it so burdensome, we could just subpoena iOS and Apple signing keys and
[00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:28.680]   do it further.
[00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:31.040]   I mean, they're being super serious about this.
[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:33.200]   This is the, this is the end game.
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:35.840]   Is, is an operating system that has a backdoor period.
[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:40.720]   Now, I have to say, I don't, I understand what the president is saying.
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:46.720]   Why shouldn't, why shouldn't there be, why should you have anything that with a duly
[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:52.840]   appointed subpoena or warrant from a law enforcement and a court?
[00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:55.320]   Why should you have anything that can't be searched?
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:59.800]   The only thing we have right now that can't be searched is our brains that they've carved
[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:01.320]   that out.
[00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:02.880]   By the way, that's only by precedent.
[00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:04.120]   They've carved that out.
[00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:08.760]   Well, and, and that's, you know, there are, I mean, one can argue that that even that is,
[00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:10.720]   is a, is a fuzzy area.
[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:15.320]   They can't prosecute you against a polyg, polygraph, but they oftentimes will ask for one, you
[00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:17.880]   know, and, and, you know, often they would like to break it.
[00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:21.440]   If they could break into our brains reliably, don't you think that would be the next thing?
[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:22.840]   They're less than a decade away.
[00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:23.840]   Right.
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:26.320]   So, so, you know, they're less than a decade away and somewhat argued that they're less
[00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:30.920]   than a couple of years away, that, you know, to being able to have a pretty good idea of
[00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:34.560]   what you're thinking, you know, maybe not be able to get it verbatim, but have enough
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:39.120]   information to really very cleanly know whether you're telling the truth or not.
[00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:42.520]   The, you know, much more accurate than a, than a polygraph.
[00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:47.840]   So the, the, but the issue that I think that it, you know, that you get into is that there's
[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:53.600]   this, the, the connection between our phone and us is so much different than anything
[00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:55.720]   that's ever been there before.
[00:19:55.720 --> 00:20:00.760]   You know, it's, it's really, it's, I think it's more than your diary, you know, if you,
[00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:05.000]   if you keep one because it's just so, you know, there's so much of what you do that's
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   in there.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.200]   And I think that's the thing that makes this more complicated, more complicated than a,
[00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:09.200]   than a warrant.
[00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:13.080]   And I want, why Lauren Farshman wants in here is has a GPS, a microphone and a camera.
[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:14.080]   What's that?
[00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:17.200]   I mean, all these things, so we don't need to tell you anymore because we know exactly
[00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:18.200]   where you are.
[00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:19.200]   We can just turn on your microphone.
[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:20.200]   We don't know.
[00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:21.200]   Yeah.
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:22.200]   We don't need to bug you anymore because you're carrying a bug.
[00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:23.200]   How, how can I serve you?
[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:24.200]   And we have a warrant.
[00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:25.720]   We can just have Apple flip that switch and your phone is live.
[00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:29.800]   So in one way, I think one argument, if I'm the president, one argument I would make
[00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:36.720]   is, well, if you choose to carry a surveillance device in your pocket, that's your choice.
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:44.120]   And as law enforcement, if we are with probable cause and court order investigating a crime,
[00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:47.840]   shouldn't we have access to that surveillance device you choose to carry in your pocket?
[00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:51.960]   Well, I think it's like Clayton said, propose that law, pass that law and then have someone
[00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:54.920]   and then that law can be challenged constitutionally, but there's been no process.
[00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:55.920]   Right.
[00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:59.040]   Like with a lot of things recently, the rush to get what they want is superseding the due
[00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:00.040]   process.
[00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:01.480]   I think I'm going to beg to differ.
[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:06.640]   I think this is very deliberate and premeditated and they finally came up with a strategy
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:09.440]   that I think is like a good move.
[00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:13.240]   Because we know that Apple was working with them since the fall, right in private.
[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:18.440]   Why all the sudden, then you not just since the fall for years for years, but even well,
[00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:23.680]   since the fall with the San Bernardino case specifically, right, or, you know, in early
[00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:25.280]   December.
[00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:27.400]   And so we knew that they were giving them information.
[00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:32.720]   They had given all sorts of data related to that case, all kinds of backups related to
[00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:36.680]   that case, and then suddenly the FBI goes public with this.
[00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:41.680]   This is a boon for law enforcement because I have already in my house, Amazon, echoes
[00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:47.000]   Xbox one and a Samsung TV, all of which have microphones that are connected to the internet.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:53.240]   And if they can get the right to ask any tech company for special, you know, for firmware
[00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:58.360]   that has a law enforcement backdoor on it, they can, there's nowhere I have that I could
[00:21:58.360 --> 00:21:59.360]   be private.
[00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:03.280]   Right. What about your, what about your canary or your nest?
[00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:04.280]   Right.
[00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:06.320]   You know, having access to the, like, camera drop.
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:09.280]   I think this is what happened is law enforcement scratched their head and said, you know, what
[00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:10.280]   this is, what do we need?
[00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:11.600]   What would be the perfect solution?
[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:15.640]   Oh, just a law that's a Kalia for digital technology.
[00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:19.800]   Kalia says that telecom companies have to assist law enforcement.
[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:24.560]   What we need is a Kalia for digital technology that says you have to assist law enforcement.
[00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:25.560]   I think everyone saw it.
[00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:29.280]   But last week there was also, I forget the details of it, but they were basically
[00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:33.040]   making it overt policy that NSA could pass long information.
[00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:35.520]   They collect the law enforcement as well.
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:36.520]   Geez.
[00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:40.600]   I mean, yeah, sorry to swear, but this deserves it.
[00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:41.600]   That's horrific.
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:45.800]   And, and I think that they're clear that that Congress has no appetite for this after
[00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:48.640]   SOPA and PIPA Congress has no appetite on this path.
[00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:51.480]   They've tried on this path Kalia too before and they've turned away every day.
[00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:53.200]   And they can't, the Congress doesn't want to play this.
[00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:57.280]   I mean, this is not, it's not, they don't now, and this is where Tim Cook's genius was
[00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:02.080]   because until Tim Cook said no, this wasn't in the public awareness.
[00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:03.080]   It is now, isn't it?
[00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:04.080]   Yeah.
[00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:05.080]   Absolutely.
[00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:08.120]   And I think we can fully expect it to be more in the public awareness on Monday.
[00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:09.120]   Yes.
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:11.400]   When, when Apple comes up, 15 minutes is my guess.
[00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:12.720]   They're going to spend time on this.
[00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:17.040]   We dedicated during that event, the day before that they, you know, the day before they have
[00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:20.960]   to defend it, they're going to make their case in front of millions of people watching
[00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:24.760]   that live, that live feed and all the press that it's going to get.
[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:27.560]   And I think that they're, you know, they're going to keep on pushing this down the path.
[00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:31.840]   And I think that it is going to make any kind of, the issue is that the people who understand
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:36.400]   what the danger is, they are very active.
[00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:38.320]   And then the rest of the population kind of doesn't understand it.
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:42.720]   And it's not a huge, it's, you know, it's not as important to them as taxes or law and
[00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:46.640]   order or a general law and order or abortion or whatever those things are.
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:49.520]   They're much more committed to that than whether their phone's encrypted or not.
[00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:54.720]   And so it makes it very unpalatable for Congress to go, to go down that path.
[00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:59.320]   So this is kind of a Hail Mary because I think that the law enforcement has decided that
[00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:00.880]   they can't win in Congress.
[00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:03.520]   And so there's no reason to wait for that or try to push that down the path.
[00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:04.520]   This is their chance.
[00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:08.760]   And they know, I mean, the risk that they have is they lose this in the Supreme Court.
[00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:09.760]   It's over.
[00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:12.760]   Like in, and it will shut.
[00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:15.320]   Because now they've created a, you know, they've created a space race.
[00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:19.520]   I mean, you've got Facebook, Google, all these, you know, all these companies are now ramping
[00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:21.360]   up for encryption.
[00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:27.320]   If the FBI loses this case and why it's kind of dangerous for them to go down this path,
[00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:34.840]   if they lose this case, they'll, the entire communication industry will be locked out
[00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:35.840]   for them.
[00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:40.960]   Well, it's interesting because it's the way you ask the question, right, in polls.
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:44.680]   Do you want terrorists to have, be able to keep their data private in an investigation?
[00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:46.120]   No, of course not.
[00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:47.120]   Oh, okay.
[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:51.000]   Do you want the government to know exactly where your kids are located and your health
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.400]   records made public and the government to have access to your private photos, emails,
[00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:57.240]   information, health data, et cetera?
[00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:59.560]   Oh, hell no, I don't want that.
[00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:03.920]   So it's this, it's this split between what Leo, what you were talking about earlier, this
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:05.960]   idea that we are, we want law enforcement, right?
[00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:08.200]   We want these protections, the rule of law.
[00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:14.200]   But do you want an armored Humvee at a pumpkin festival in New Hampshire for Mildred's
[00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:18.800]   pumpkin festival and tanks they're rolling in to protect us against the off chance that
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:24.120]   someone is going to bring a bomb to Mildred's pumpkin festival in the fall.
[00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:26.760]   And you're seeing this, or getting close to that by the way.
[00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:28.920]   Well, it's every site where there are enough Humvees.
[00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:30.440]   I think there would.
[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:33.720]   This is every, this is every dystopian future movie that we watched.
[00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:37.960]   And these are the bad guys from those movies, you know, in the classic arguments every time
[00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:39.880]   and it's, it's not a movie now, it's real life.
[00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:41.360]   And we sort of didn't learn these last time.
[00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:44.640]   I don't want to, and again, and I often say this, I don't want to get in a quote, an
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:49.320]   argument against government, that's an argument that could be had, and I'm not saying it shouldn't
[00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:54.440]   be had, but that's a separate argument than whether in a nation of laws there should be
[00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:59.400]   a law preventing encryption and what would be the cons, I think the real question, and
[00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:01.400]   Tim Cook has brought this up and it's very smart of him.
[00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:06.000]   And this is where Apple should hit what would be the consequences of such a law.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   It would it would in fact improve our safety or not.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.560]   And I think it's so clear that it would not and the history is there that it would
[00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:17.480]   not that that's the point Apple needs to continue to hammer home.
[00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:19.520]   I suspect they will on Monday.
[00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:25.080]   Let's take a break because we've talked about this a lot, but those are two new data points
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:29.920]   we got to bring up, you know, the president talking about this and I'm really glad we
[00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:34.680]   could get Clayton on because he's fighting the good fight on television, no less.
[00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:37.760]   Any pushback from anybody at Fox over that?
[00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:41.520]   No, I'll say this because people always say this to me about Fox, right?
[00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:43.560]   I've been there almost nine years now.
[00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:48.960]   No one has ever ever told me what to say, think or do.
[00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:51.480]   First thing I was ever told when I was hired there is be yourself.
[00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:52.800]   And that's all I've ever done.
[00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:56.800]   So my personal feeling about this is I don't want the government in my phone.
[00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:59.880]   And you know, when I think these bloviating bureaucrats who don't know what the heck
[00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:02.240]   they're talking about, I'm going to take them to task on the show.
[00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:03.800]   That's the way that I've always done my job.
[00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:05.600]   I call BS on both sides.
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:08.480]   Democrats and Republicans when they're spin, I can't stand it.
[00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:09.480]   Good.
[00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:10.480]   Good.
[00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:11.480]   Let's take a break.
[00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:13.160]   We will talk about something that's happening next week.
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:16.960]   And I guess next Tuesday will be the day after.
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:21.600]   And so we'll have a special kind of Mac break dissecting what Apple has announced.
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:23.640]   And of course we as always will cover it live.
[00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:24.640]   Are they streaming live?
[00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:25.640]   Do we know?
[00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:26.640]   Yes.
[00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:27.640]   You got the invitation.
[00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:28.640]   What does the invitation say?
[00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:31.480]   Ten o'clock at Cupertino.
[00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:32.480]   Lupus in.
[00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:33.480]   So 10 a.m.
[00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:37.440]   On Monday the 21st, we will go live with coverage.
[00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:41.120]   I think that we will have you Alex Lindsey.
[00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:42.120]   You're checking your schedule.
[00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:44.560]   It certainly will be me because I don't ever get invited these things.
[00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:48.040]   And even if I did, I'd want to be here anchoring it.
[00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:53.400]   And Megan Moroni from iOS today and Tech News today.
[00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:56.800]   And we will be streaming it live but with commentary.
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:28:00.480]   And as I will tell everybody then, if you want it without commentary, you can watch
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:01.720]   the live feed from Apple.
[00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:08.000]   If you'd like to know what we think are dissection, are commentary on that.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   The mystery science.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   And that's really valuable.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   Like I think some people don't notice like don't realize I can just watch Apple.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.560]   But when you put it in context and you give people the background and you tell them sort
[00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:18.240]   of what it means to them, it's enormously valuable.
[00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:20.040]   I was like watching a football game.
[00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:21.040]   Yeah.
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:22.040]   Just watching the game or listening.
[00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:25.840]   Sometimes people get crazy when they hear the announcers and color commentary.
[00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:28.960]   Well, sometimes you come out of the smoke filled room and you're like, and then when
[00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:31.680]   the dust settles and you get back to the hotel and you're actually like, wait a second.
[00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:35.560]   Well, that really just, you know, it's hard sometimes in that reality distortion field.
[00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:37.360]   It's one of the reasons I don't.
[00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:42.160]   I, of course, I was very glad I got to see almost all of Steve's presentations because
[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:46.240]   there's a showman parks and it was really historic to be able to watch him.
[00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:50.920]   On the other hand, it is true that you want to go out of those things wanting to buy every
[00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:56.840]   possible thing they can sell, including iPod socks and high fives and all sorts of junk.
[00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:58.080]   And subscribing to mobile me.
[00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:04.080]   And then saying our heads prevail or you'll want hopes in a day or two.
[00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:08.360]   So I like to, I don't mind sitting a little bit of outside the reality of the distortion
[00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:10.440]   field if possible.
[00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:14.040]   We'll talk about what's going to happen next week with two guys who are going and two guys
[00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:17.520]   who are staying behind as we continue to make break weekly.
[00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:18.520]   I showed it.
[00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:19.520]   I brought to you.
[00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:22.000]   We're really, we've had a lassian as a sponsor for a long time.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:27.920]   We've talked about Jira before and hip chat before, but it all comes from one place at
[00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:34.680]   lassian.com, A T L A S Atlas S I A N.
[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:40.640]   See in behind every great human achievement is a team, whether it's genome mapping or bringing
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:46.120]   3D printing to the desktop or exploring space or renewable energy or, you know, just planning
[00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:48.160]   your next off site.
[00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:53.680]   One way to bring everybody together, the great tools from Atlassian and we use many of them.
[00:29:53.680 --> 00:30:00.120]   We designed our website, we use Jira all the way to support the development of it.
[00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:03.960]   It was a great way to take the team in Austin and the team up here and keep them on the same
[00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:04.960]   page.
[00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:05.960]   We use hip chat to talk.
[00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:07.200]   In fact, we liked it so much.
[00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:13.520]   We continue to use hip chat all the time in engineering and ops in our web team.
[00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:15.680]   It is a great way to stay in touch.
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:21.120]   Hip chat is kind of a messaging platform, but really so much more because you can tell,
[00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:24.760]   if we just, I should show you our hip chat because Russell's been tying, he tied in something
[00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:27.120]   called panoptic into our hip chat.
[00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:33.400]   Now we know more about what's going on with our servers and our partner servers and often
[00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:38.080]   than they do, we'll call our partners and say, hey, I see panoptic and hip chat is saying
[00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:39.080]   you're down.
[00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:40.080]   What?
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:41.080]   What?
[00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:42.560]   Maybe they should get hip chat.
[00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:47.520]   You also got to take a look at confluence, create, share content, organize results, bring
[00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:51.600]   team members up to speed with the flexibility of confluence.
[00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:56.000]   And of course, if you've got code, you want to test, review and manage it in real time
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:01.160]   and there's nothing better for that than Bitbucket at Lassian has got it all.
[00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:02.160]   You got it.
[00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:03.160]   You got to check it out.
[00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:06.040]   Atlas, S-I-A-N dot com.
[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:07.040]   Check them out.
[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:12.240]   Learn how JIRA confluence, hip chat and Bitbucket, all four or anyone can give your team everything
[00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:17.600]   you need to organize, discuss and complete shared work.
[00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:18.680]   We really love it.
[00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:19.680]   You will too.
[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:26.560]   At lassian.com, unleash the potential in your team and build what's next at Lassian.
[00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:31.120]   We thank them for their support in advertising, but also their support and great products that
[00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:36.400]   we use every single day.
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:39.600]   So you got an invitation to Clay and you go to, you've been to every one of these, haven't
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:40.600]   you?
[00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:41.600]   You come all the way out.
[00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:44.280]   I think there's only one I've missed in the past three years.
[00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:45.280]   Wow.
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:46.280]   It was an iPod event.
[00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:47.280]   Yeah.
[00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:49.280]   So are you looking forward to it?
[00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:50.280]   I am.
[00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:59.120]   I'd like to see, I try to look at the broader consumer market for my audience and I'm more
[00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:06.160]   interested to see where the alleged 10-inch iPad fits into iPad Pro fits into that product
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:07.160]   lineup too.
[00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:12.160]   It's really the sweet spot of sales for Apple.
[00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:16.320]   So I think the majority of my audience probably picks up that size device or even maybe the
[00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:17.320]   iPad Mini.
[00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:20.520]   I think the iPad Pro may be more of a niche product.
[00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:24.120]   Although today I was doing some work at the gym and Guy came over and says, "I'm buying
[00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:25.120]   one of the iPad Pros.
[00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:26.280]   I love that size screen."
[00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:28.880]   You bring it to the gym, the big screen?
[00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:29.880]   I do.
[00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:30.880]   In fact, I put it on the treadmill.
[00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:35.200]   I've been watching some just some Linda.com videos recently and doing some different things
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:39.080]   like that and we'll do that and we'll take it down to the cafe after we work out.
[00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:42.000]   It's great for watching video because it's like having a TV with you.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   It really is.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   Yeah.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   We propped it up in bed the other night.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.160]   We were watching my wife and I were watching.
[00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:48.160]   Yeah, we were watching House of Cards.
[00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:49.160]   Let me guess.
[00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:52.120]   She was watching House of Cards but then I said, "You've got to watch what Meghan Kelly
[00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:54.680]   was just ripping into holy smokes."
[00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:56.760]   So I put the debate on there too.
[00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:57.760]   That's great.
[00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:58.760]   Yeah.
[00:32:58.760 --> 00:32:59.760]   Yeah.
[00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:00.760]   So it's great.
[00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:01.760]   I think it's a great little TV.
[00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:02.760]   It's a great TV.
[00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:05.160]   So I'm curious to see how the 10-inch, you know, the alleged 10-inch iPad Pro.
[00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:10.320]   With that new, the leaked photos of the new keyboard case.
[00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:11.840]   And you know, I'm not one of these.
[00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:13.440]   I'm not a crazy keyboard guy.
[00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:14.440]   I adapt.
[00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:19.320]   I think like Renee kind of quickly did keyboards and I love the smart case.
[00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:20.880]   I love the smart keyboard case.
[00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:21.880]   That's the one I ended up using.
[00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:24.640]   I bought the Logitech Creative Case.
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:26.320]   It was too bulky and heavy and big.
[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:27.320]   Oh, it's huge.
[00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:28.320]   Yeah.
[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:29.320]   I thought this is bigger than my Mac book.
[00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:32.440]   I don't need another Mac book.
[00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:37.680]   And so you're right, for just casual like password entry or search terms and stuff like
[00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:39.560]   that, the Apple case is fine.
[00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:40.560]   It's light.
[00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:41.560]   It's portable.
[00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:43.000]   That's the one I ended up using.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   Yeah.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   And you know what's funny about the iPad Pro?
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.800]   I haven't taken, I don't ever take that case off.
[00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:52.160]   I mean, rarely do I take it off unless I want to use like the Apple pencil on drawing or
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:53.160]   something, my son.
[00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:54.160]   No, it's nice to have a keyboard.
[00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:55.160]   You get used to it.
[00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:56.160]   Yeah.
[00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:58.440]   I end up using it in the battery life as killer.
[00:33:58.440 --> 00:33:59.440]   So how are they going to do Renee?
[00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:02.400]   How are they going to do a keyboard on a 10-inch iPad?
[00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:03.400]   Pro.
[00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:06.240]   Well, that's the question because as far as I know, like Apple's made some small Mac books,
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:11.440]   but they've never made a first party keyboard that's in the 9.7 to 10-inch range.
[00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:14.840]   You know, famously they said they didn't think that book keyboards were very good.
[00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:17.760]   So whether they leave that, whether they just make the smart connector and they let
[00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:22.680]   Lodge Attack and other companies that have a history of making those keyboards do it.
[00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:27.480]   But I think that if you look at the smart keyboard case now, there's room on both edges.
[00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:31.480]   And on the MacBook, the 12-inch MacBook, Apple goes right to the edge on that.
[00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:36.480]   So if they could somehow formulate a keyboard that doesn't necessarily make the keys smaller,
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:39.080]   just to test it, I stuck my iPad Air on the keyboard case.
[00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:41.080]   And it doesn't quite reach all the way across.
[00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:44.840]   So the keys would have to sort of compact in and shrink in a little bit.
[00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:48.440]   But if they could basically use as much of those square inches as possible, I think they'd
[00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:54.000]   have a keyboard that's maybe not quite as functional as the Pro, but gets very close.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:59.160]   And then of course, the iPhone, a 4-inch iPhone, the SE.
[00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:00.160]   We've talked about this.
[00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:02.880]   Renee, have you seen any new rumors across the wire?
[00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:05.080]   I mean, is there anything that we didn't expect?
[00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:11.600]   No, I mean, I think, again, the iPod Touch from last year is the perfect symbol for this.
[00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:14.720]   It's not the super popular product like the iPhone, but there are millions of people who
[00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:15.800]   really love it.
[00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:18.200]   And Apple wants to give them the best experience possible.
[00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:23.280]   So while a lot of people have moved to the 6S and 6S+, there are a percentage, 10 to
[00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:25.560]   15% who really want a smaller phone.
[00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:29.480]   They want it for their pockets, for their clutches, for one hand that ease of use.
[00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:35.200]   And if they can take the iPhone 5S package with some small alterations, but bring the
[00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:40.000]   A9 and bring the new eyesight camera and bring those technologies to it, then people who
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.680]   really want that form factor, which is 10 to 15 to 20 million people, get a really, really
[00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:47.240]   good phone and maybe work their way up that upgrade cycle.
[00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:49.480]   So it's sort of win-win for both Apple and us.
[00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:53.600]   And I do think for companies like mine, who are just about to refresh, what we're really
[00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:58.280]   excited about, of course, is just a less expensive phone that we can buy lots of in a
[00:35:58.280 --> 00:35:59.280]   round.
[00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:00.280]   Yeah.
[00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:01.280]   So I think that that's also a big of a factor.
[00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:02.280]   But your box less?
[00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:03.280]   How much less?
[00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:05.440]   Well, the tech communities forget this part, I think, quite a lot, because we're used
[00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:06.440]   to right.
[00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:07.840]   Like, we judge things based on what we like.
[00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:10.400]   So I like 128 gigabyte iPhone 6S plus.
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:14.640]   But a lot of businesses are buying like 200, 300, 1000 phones.
[00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:16.880]   And they're the ones who buy the 16 gigabyte ones.
[00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:19.400]   It's the people who stream a lot of stuff who buy those phones.
[00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:24.760]   And for them, if this is 450, like the entry-level iPhone 4S is, that's a considerable saving,
[00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:26.400]   especially when they buy it in bulk.
[00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:29.320]   And they don't need a lot of space because they're using business to business apps and
[00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:30.880]   web portals and things like that.
[00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:33.840]   So they might still buy a smaller iPhone even.
[00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:36.800]   They're not going to do an AOP gig or even a 16.
[00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:38.320]   No, no, I think they might do a 16.
[00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:39.320]   Yeah.
[00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:43.440]   Well, they'll do 16 because when you combine, again, there are a lot of companies and some
[00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:47.480]   use cases like streamers who just don't need the storage space as wasted on them.
[00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:52.440]   So if they can save money, especially now that you have app thinning, which is the slicing
[00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:57.280]   and the on-demand resources and the bit code, you can get a lot more on when you have iCloud
[00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:00.120]   Photo Library and iCloud and Apple Music.
[00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:05.520]   You have all this sort of quote unquote "nearline" technology that's making that space more optimized
[00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:06.920]   and more useful than ever before.
[00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:10.280]   So that's where people like Alex come in where they want to buy dozens, if not hundreds,
[00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:12.000]   if not thousands of them.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   Not yet.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   There's still not too thousands yet.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.720]   But he's growing all the time, though.
[00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:19.320]   Alex, these are second phones.
[00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:22.040]   A lot of these are employees that already have their own phones.
[00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:23.040]   These are second phones.
[00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:26.480]   So for that reason alone, you don't need a very fancy.
[00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:32.680]   And also, would you buy the 16 gigabyte version, which is allegedly still going to be the baseline
[00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:33.680]   size?
[00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:34.680]   Most likely.
[00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:35.680]   Yeah.
[00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:38.200]   I mean, the thing that we really care about is actually the quality of the camera because
[00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:39.760]   we do a lot of site surveys.
[00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:43.880]   So having a good camera is something that is important to us.
[00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:46.440]   Yeah, it's you'll probably be happy.
[00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:48.080]   You'll probably be happy.
[00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:49.640]   Straight from the horse's mouth.
[00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:50.640]   Yeah.
[00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:52.960]   Apple focuses on cameras a lot.
[00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:53.960]   I mean, they care.
[00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:57.000]   And it's interesting now because there's a lot of other cameras and every company does
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:58.320]   it a little bit differently.
[00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:02.680]   It's almost like when you go into an electronics store and you see all the different televisions
[00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:06.560]   and different television technologies where some companies, Apple really wants to reproduce
[00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:07.720]   what your eyes sees.
[00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:09.480]   They don't want to crunch the blacks too much.
[00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:10.800]   They don't want to saturate the colors too much.
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:12.520]   They figure you'll do that in post.
[00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:15.640]   So they want to sort of give you using their image signal processor.
[00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:20.080]   They want to give you the best baseline image that they can in the quickest way possible.
[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:23.520]   And I think that for a lot of people is a really good option.
[00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:29.480]   So Alex, you made a prediction, I think an interesting prediction that Tim Cook would
[00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:32.320]   spend some time talking about the encryption deal.
[00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:34.800]   You think he'll kick off with that?
[00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:35.800]   I bet you he will.
[00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:36.800]   I bet you will.
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:42.680]   The thing that Apple usually does is they use that first 15 to 20 minutes to push whatever
[00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:43.680]   they say.
[00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:45.760]   Their sales, anything else they want to say.
[00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:46.840]   So I think he's going to open up.
[00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:48.920]   That's the primary time he's going to have the press.
[00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:51.640]   He knows they're going to be there waiting for whatever the product is.
[00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:53.040]   He has their undivided attention.
[00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:56.240]   I think that he's going to use somewhere in that first 15 to 20 minutes he's going to
[00:38:56.240 --> 00:39:02.840]   talk about this fight and make his case as elegantly as he can with three days of practice.
[00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:04.760]   Clayton, do you go with a camera crew?
[00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:06.720]   Yeah, we'll have a camera crew there.
[00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:08.920]   We'll have our live truck there as well.
[00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:11.880]   So this is the kind of thing you would run out.
[00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:18.400]   Yeah, I mean, yeah, you know, I'll be doing live hits beforehand and probably afterwards.
[00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:21.920]   I think, you know, I'd be interested to see if he spends like that much time off the top,
[00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:22.920]   though.
[00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:25.600]   I think he may mention in passing.
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:30.680]   I think maybe more when they, if they have an iOS preview, talk about how important privacy
[00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:34.880]   is to our customers and spend that time maybe a little bit deeper in the show.
[00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:36.360]   But I would be really surprised.
[00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:41.280]   I think, you know, they just like to surprise us to spend 15 minutes off the top, really
[00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:43.720]   diving into encryption and that sort of thing.
[00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:44.800]   I'd be surprised.
[00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:47.640]   But I think the whole mention it definitely off the top.
[00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:49.240]   I don't know how deeply they'll go.
[00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:50.240]   I'm with Alex.
[00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:52.960]   I think this is such an important thing for Tim Cook.
[00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:57.600]   And I think that given they moved it a week, maybe they moved it a week because something
[00:39:57.600 --> 00:40:01.440]   wasn't ready or maybe they moved it a week because they'd like to be the day before the
[00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:02.440]   judge rules.
[00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:03.440]   Yeah.
[00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:04.640]   What are they looping us into, Leo?
[00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:05.640]   If not this.
[00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:08.040]   I, well, I mean, what does that mean?
[00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:10.080]   It's that it's at one infinite loop, right?
[00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:11.080]   Yeah, right.
[00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:13.200]   It's like the final event at one infinite loop.
[00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:16.880]   I don't know that they put that lid on that big round theater.
[00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:18.400]   But it's not till next year.
[00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:21.160]   I'm guessing it's going to be the iPhone eight announcement that they'll open up the new
[00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:22.160]   campus.
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:25.480]   Oh, that was a nice because there's no way WWDC is going to be in town hall.
[00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:26.800]   So that that's out.
[00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:27.800]   Yeah.
[00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:28.800]   Can you imagine?
[00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:29.800]   Yeah.
[00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:30.800]   Probably three developers here today.
[00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:31.800]   Yeah.
[00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:32.800]   Right.
[00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:34.640]   How big is this place that they're going to do the event on Monday?
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:36.400]   Oh, it's so small.
[00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:38.520]   It's the smallest venue they have.
[00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:40.440]   We were talking about Hamilton on Broadway.
[00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:44.520]   It's like a third of the size of Hamilton going to see like a Broadway show.
[00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:46.320]   You know, 300 people, 350 people.
[00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:49.040]   It's where the 5K IMAX was two years ago.
[00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:50.040]   Really?
[00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:51.040]   Yeah.
[00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:55.880]   The last time I was there was when the iPod socks and the Apple iPod high-fiber announced
[00:40:55.880 --> 00:41:01.440]   and then we were there and then they had it upstairs where you could go and they had
[00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:05.680]   made it into a house and see how all the different rooms like buddy and sis.
[00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:06.680]   Wait, there were there.
[00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:09.280]   I think the 5K IMAX was in San Jose, was it not?
[00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:14.920]   No, it was the phone and then a month later we came back for the 5K IMAX and the iPads
[00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:16.600]   or the iPad Mini.
[00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:19.840]   Sometimes they do infinite loop because they just can't book something or they don't want
[00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:23.680]   to book something and tell everybody they've got something else coming up.
[00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:25.640]   They always want less capacity than they have interest.
[00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:27.560]   So depending on what the product is, they'll come up with it.
[00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:30.040]   Yeah, they can't possibly get everybody in no matter what.
[00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:34.320]   But when you're down at 350, it gives people like me just kind of the slightest bit of,
[00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:38.760]   well, of course they didn't invite me because I'm not as important as those other 350 people
[00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:39.760]   they invited.
[00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:44.120]   And as long as there's no lame bloggers in there, I'll be happy.
[00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:47.480]   No, I don't care.
[00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:51.600]   So what any other surprises are, is there anything else we're expecting that might not?
[00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:52.600]   iOS 9.3.
[00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:56.320]   So I'm guessing we'll have Craig Federico talk about things like night shift and security,
[00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:58.200]   like the secure notes option.
[00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:01.200]   And the education one would make a really good demo because they have all that new classroom
[00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:02.440]   and teacher communication stuff.
[00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:03.440]   Tell us about that.
[00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:07.160]   So it's for iPad and basically it allows you to set it up in schools and it's like mobile
[00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:11.920]   to mice management, but really optimized for a school setting so kids can pick up an iPad
[00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:15.920]   and log in and they have what's really cool is because kids can be kindergarten in high
[00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:16.920]   school.
[00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:21.120]   And while high school kids understand things like an Apple ID versus a pin code, kindergarten
[00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:24.320]   kids and early elementary kids don't, so they'll have a unified login that gets them
[00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:28.080]   into the device and into their accounts at the same time.
[00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:29.400]   It'll use on demand storage.
[00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:33.480]   So like let's say Leo uses the same iPad for 20 days, but then he's away and it's my
[00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:34.480]   iPad now.
[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:37.280]   It'll keep as much of Leo's stuff as possible while I'm using it.
[00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:40.800]   So if he comes back, it doesn't have to reload everything, but it'll give me space.
[00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:44.600]   So it's almost like multi, it's the beginnings of multi user on iPad.
[00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:45.600]   And it also has the most.
[00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:47.040]   The multi user is in the code, isn't it?
[00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:51.320]   I mean, we've seen it before, but you don't think they'll unlock it.
[00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:52.320]   Not for everyone.
[00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:55.360]   Like maybe iOS 10 or iOS 11 because there's a whole bunch of questions that you get.
[00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:58.920]   Like it's easy to say that we should have multi user, but we don't want to have it like
[00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:01.400]   we have it on a Mac because it's a very different machine.
[00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:02.400]   So how does it keep your data?
[00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:03.840]   How does it separate your data?
[00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:07.520]   All these are big questions and education is a very constrained model that they can sort
[00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:11.400]   of prototype these things with because it's all managed by the school system.
[00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:14.640]   It's not on a very different user by user basis, but it's great.
[00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:18.440]   The teacher can push assignments to the kids, get stuff back, phrase your spirits at an
[00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:20.320]   excellent article on it for Mac stories.
[00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:25.000]   And it's it really shows Apple again, taking that next step towards their traditional base
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   of education.
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   It's funny.
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   We get a really good demo on that.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:35.160]   It's very controversial right now in Petaluma because the public schools floated a bond so
[00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:41.360]   they could buy iPads for all 7000 kids, K through 12 in Petaluma.
[00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:45.560]   And now the school board is getting inundated by parents who are upset because their kids
[00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:49.680]   can surf the web for bad things.
[00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:51.240]   Yeah, well, that's a big thing.
[00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:55.520]   Like Google has a huge advantage education because they can provide a persistent environment.
[00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:59.080]   And Apple, you know, iCloud does a lot of thinking, but it's not the same kind of login
[00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:00.920]   to your account anywhere and use it.
[00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:04.560]   So they're trying to make sort of a persistent environment for kids, but their focus is going
[00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:05.560]   to be privacy.
[00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:08.520]   Like, I remember my God kids got a Google account and they came home and told them to
[00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:09.600]   log in.
[00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:13.560]   And then it said you can play Pac-Man on your street and suddenly they're munching cars
[00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:14.800]   and houses on their street.
[00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:17.840]   But I'm thinking, uh, now everyone knows where my, where my God kids live.
[00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:20.680]   So they're going to sort of position this where maybe it's not as ubiquitous and you
[00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:24.360]   can't log in everywhere like Google, but we're going to show you all these sort of privacy
[00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:25.360]   protections up front.
[00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:26.360]   It's a tough thing.
[00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:31.760]   I mean, here in the, in Petaluma, kindergartners and high school seniors have the same content
[00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:32.760]   restrictions.
[00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:33.760]   Yeah.
[00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:39.400]   So, you know, clearly a high school senior needs to, for research and, and that, by the
[00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:43.160]   way, that's one of the things kids are complaining about is I got to research a paper and I can't
[00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:44.160]   see anything.
[00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:45.160]   A kindergartener.
[00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:48.760]   Shouldn't I see that, you know, I know this is a lot of parents.
[00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:49.760]   Elbow.
[00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:50.760]   Ooh.
[00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:54.520]   The, the primary content restriction that, that I still apply with my kids is that they
[00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:56.160]   can't take them into their rooms.
[00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:58.440]   So they have, they have, they can use, I don't have a lot of things.
[00:44:58.440 --> 00:44:59.680]   Yes, we do the same things.
[00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:00.680]   Yeah.
[00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:01.680]   But they have to do it in the way.
[00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:03.480]   Michael keeps saying, when can I have my computer in my room?
[00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:04.480]   I've been listening, never.
[00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:09.320]   So, when you move out, you know, and, and, you know, and I think that that's the, and
[00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:12.760]   I think that that is the, for me, has been the most important thing that kind of keeps
[00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:14.720]   a lot of that sorted out.
[00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:15.720]   Yeah.
[00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:16.720]   Yeah.
[00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:19.920]   I think at the software level that's, talk about surprises where, you know, Apple can
[00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:22.720]   really keep those things secret.
[00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:24.440]   We don't see a ton of leaks.
[00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:28.160]   We've seen a bunch of betas obviously for, you know, TVOS 9.2.
[00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:31.560]   So I think what there's been like six betas right now of, uh,
[00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:32.560]   Yes, very dictation.
[00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:33.400]   That's awesome.
[00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:37.720]   So dictating username and passwords, which will be, which will be great.
[00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:38.720]   Oh, really?
[00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:39.720]   Yeah.
[00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:40.720]   Yeah.
[00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:43.720]   I can say 734 asterisk capital H lowercase u GT1.
[00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:47.800]   And they're trying to do multi language because that's the huge.
[00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:48.800]   Yeah.
[00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:49.800]   I mean, as well as Siri understands it.
[00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:53.000]   And the huge thing is also a lot of people, when you do entertainment, you might be asking
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:54.520]   for a movie in Spanish.
[00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:57.920]   That way the NSA, when they turn on the echo, they can hear me.
[00:45:57.920 --> 00:45:58.920]   Yes.
[00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:01.600]   My password that makes it much simpler for everyone.
[00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:04.200]   Well, you can use the app still too.
[00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:07.400]   And you know, that's the only way to do it, I think.
[00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:08.400]   Yeah.
[00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:10.120]   They've added, they've added recently too.
[00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:12.280]   Maybe they had this from the beginning and I just never noticed it.
[00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:16.200]   At least it wasn't working in the beginning, but like the most recently used, like if you're
[00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:20.880]   putting in your email address, logging into MLB, those types of things, like it's, it's
[00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:23.880]   remembering your most recently used email addresses.
[00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:27.440]   So if you've got a long email address, Gmail, et cetera, you know, you've got a, you've got
[00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:29.760]   to plug that information in, but it's at least storing it there.
[00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:35.040]   So that I'm excited about iOS 9.3, as Renee mentioned, and whether or not we'll see any
[00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:36.520]   Mac books.
[00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:41.520]   I think it's, you know, I would love to get my hands on a new Mac books.
[00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:43.960]   Sometimes between now and June.
[00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:46.080]   You don't think they'll do it tomorrow and Monday?
[00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:50.560]   I think that Skylake is getting, like, I think Intel's fixing a lot of the early growing
[00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:53.680]   pains with Skylake, but I think that Apple tends to like focused events.
[00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:59.720]   And when you have the new iPhone, the new iPad, iOS 9.3, watch OS 2.0, yeah.
[00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:01.440]   And then you start adding Macs to it.
[00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:05.160]   They might do, if it's not a huge upgrade, like if it's just a Skylake spec boost and
[00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:08.440]   not a redesign, they could put that out in a press release at any time.
[00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:11.240]   And if it's something bigger, they've done Mac books at WWDC before.
[00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:15.560]   Well, I do think it's going to be something bigger because just adding another connector
[00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:17.800]   of the Mac book would be a very nice thing.
[00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:20.480]   And that you'd want to talk about.
[00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:22.720]   That's not, you know, a slipstream that out, right?
[00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:23.720]   Or not.
[00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:24.720]   What do you want?
[00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:27.000]   Clayton in the new Mac, you by presume you have the old Mac book.
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.160]   Yeah, I have, yeah, I have the first.
[00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:30.160]   I love it.
[00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:31.680]   Yeah, it's great.
[00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:32.840]   It's a little slow.
[00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:38.680]   And for instance, I run a built a real estate company and my just hired an individual and
[00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:45.480]   she was asking me what, you know, her old Mac book, one of the, was it the shiny white
[00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:46.480]   round one from?
[00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:47.480]   She still has that.
[00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:48.480]   Yeah.
[00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:49.480]   Yeah.
[00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:50.480]   So, plastic.
[00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:54.480]   I said, just wait a week because this might be the perfect device for you, you know, to
[00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:59.000]   be able to tell people on the radio that too, that you don't, this is a bad time to
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   buy a Mac book.
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   Right.
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   But maybe not.
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:03.000]   Maybe Renee's right.
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:04.960]   Maybe we should always wait.
[00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:08.320]   If it on the off chance, if there's a 1% chance that we get the event, it's always better
[00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:09.320]   for you.
[00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:13.000]   You don't want to buy any Mac or Apple products period when there's a yes.
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:14.400]   What happens to the ear?
[00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:16.400]   But Leah, we all want you to buy one.
[00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:20.920]   That's the, is that we all want you to buy one because I think that that's the, that's
[00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:22.240]   very advantageous for the rest of us.
[00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:23.680]   It's you really serving the community.
[00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:24.680]   Yes.
[00:48:24.680 --> 00:48:26.320]   By doing your all mitzvah.
[00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:27.320]   It's a good idea.
[00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:28.320]   Yeah.
[00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:33.720]   I'm curious what will happen to the air and, you know, how, how much?
[00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:35.440]   The year survive in a Mac book.
[00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:36.440]   Right.
[00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:37.440]   I think so.
[00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:38.440]   Not very long.
[00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:39.440]   Yeah.
[00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:40.440]   So many people love that 11 inch though.
[00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:43.120]   They'll keep it until the price point of the Mac book drops, just like they kept the old
[00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:46.680]   Mac book around until the air price got down to eight, you know, at a $900.
[00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:48.200]   So it'll, it'll last for a while.
[00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:51.720]   But I think eventually that Mac book is going to be the future of the Mac book.
[00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:53.720]   I will never understand how people use an 11 inch.
[00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:55.680]   I see Jason Snell using an 11 inch ear.
[00:48:55.680 --> 00:48:58.120]   I've seen Dalrymple using like he used to use that all the time.
[00:48:58.120 --> 00:48:59.120]   Really?
[00:48:59.120 --> 00:49:00.120]   Such a contrast.
[00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:02.960]   I know because he was huge Jim Dalrymple sitting there at, at the chieftain pounding
[00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:03.960]   away on the tiny level.
[00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:06.120]   All I can say is economy.
[00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:07.200]   Makes him look like, hey, go on.
[00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:08.200]   Enemy seating.
[00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:11.040]   That is the push for 11 inch is economy seating.
[00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:13.880]   I can actually open it and work on it.
[00:49:13.880 --> 00:49:14.880]   For someone who flies.
[00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:15.880]   I used to fly.
[00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:16.880]   I have to go for that now.
[00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:17.880]   Yeah.
[00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:19.560]   I have pros the best airplane computer I've ever had.
[00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:21.080]   Is it good at even an economy?
[00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:22.080]   Yeah.
[00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:25.480]   And even I had a really horrible economy of flight in Delta where I literally had a chair
[00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:27.520]   that felt like it was two inches in front of me.
[00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:31.360]   And I still had, I couldn't open up the MacBook as tiny as it was, but I had the iPad Pro
[00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:33.200]   and I was just working the way on it.
[00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:34.200]   It was great.
[00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:36.600]   That is a bad chair if you can't open a MacBook.
[00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:37.600]   Yeah.
[00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:38.600]   Wow.
[00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:39.600]   Thanks Delta.
[00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:40.600]   Wow.
[00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:45.080]   But as the shill says, Jim Dalrymple's eyes are no bigger than anyone else's.
[00:49:45.080 --> 00:49:47.320]   And you know, Serenity uses the 11 inch MacBook Air.
[00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:48.320]   I think she's looking up great.
[00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:49.320]   She's tiny.
[00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:50.400]   But some people, Georgia uses that too.
[00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:52.040]   I think a lot of people really love that machine.
[00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:53.040]   Yeah.
[00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:54.800]   So small.
[00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:56.880]   I would look like Hagar the horrible.
[00:49:56.880 --> 00:50:00.120]   I just don't like the lack of vertical pixel height because I just feel claustrophobic.
[00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:01.600]   I just want a lot of pixels.
[00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:03.480]   You know, it's all about pixel height, isn't it?
[00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:04.480]   Really?
[00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:05.480]   It comes down to it.
[00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:06.960]   I don't even know what you're talking about.
[00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:11.240]   The lack of, on a website, like you're looking at a web page, it's not a lot of pixels.
[00:50:11.240 --> 00:50:12.240]   Like you don't see much.
[00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:13.240]   Oh, I see what you mean.
[00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:14.240]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:15.640]   Or if you're opening Photoshop, everything's a document.
[00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:17.200]   Everything's below the fold.
[00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:18.400]   And it's also the widescreen.
[00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:21.200]   So you got even less because of the aspect ratio.
[00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:23.240]   Yeah.
[00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:29.240]   Anything else to say about the event, just that we'll be covering it, we'll be there.
[00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:30.400]   You guys will be there.
[00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:35.320]   Alex and I will be sitting outside with our nose pressed against the figurative window.
[00:50:35.320 --> 00:50:36.320]   Pardon me?
[00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:37.320]   Yeah, black million.
[00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:38.320]   You want to loop?
[00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:39.320]   Black Milanese loop.
[00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:42.520]   The world has been waiting.
[00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:43.520]   Where is my black?
[00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:46.360]   And will we have what do they call those NATO bands?
[00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:47.360]   Yep.
[00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:48.360]   Apparently NATO bands, some new ones.
[00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:49.360]   What is a NATO band?
[00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:51.280]   Those are the nylon straps.
[00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:55.760]   So people who want to sport experience, but it's a plastic one.
[00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:56.760]   Sorry, Alex.
[00:50:56.760 --> 00:51:01.240]   Well, you're the, no, Renee, you're the watch band guru.
[00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:02.600]   You're the king of watch bands.
[00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:03.600]   Nobody else.
[00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:05.800]   I think that's the whole plan is that I've bought all of them so they're not getting
[00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:06.800]   any more money out of me.
[00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:07.800]   So they have to quickly release some more.
[00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:08.800]   I can't even get into it.
[00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:09.800]   I can't even get into it.
[00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:11.600]   It's been as bucks on.
[00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:12.600]   I love it.
[00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:15.280]   So my big question is whether I'll be along because like right now I have a Hermes and
[00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:17.040]   they only sell it as a complete watch.
[00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:19.600]   But if they put out new Hermes bands, I'm going to want them.
[00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:21.480]   And I don't want another watch.
[00:51:21.480 --> 00:51:23.480]   You need another Hermes watch.
[00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:24.480]   Right.
[00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:26.480]   I'm going to podcast about watch bands for.
[00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:27.480]   I bet he's got them.
[00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:28.480]   I bet he's already got it.
[00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:29.480]   You got to start that, Alex.
[00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:30.480]   You don't have it already?
[00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:32.480]   I don't have a watch band podcast now.
[00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:33.480]   Called the band wagon.
[00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:34.480]   The band wagon.
[00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:35.480]   Ooh.
[00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:40.880]   Oh, Jason, stop giving the competition ideas.
[00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:41.880]   I just copyrighted it.
[00:51:41.880 --> 00:51:42.880]   So it's good.
[00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:43.880]   We're all friends here.
[00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:44.880]   Bandwagon.com.
[00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:45.880]   Cool.
[00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:47.880]   Watch band weekly.
[00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:48.880]   Watch band wagon.
[00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:49.880]   I like it.
[00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:52.640]   And you'll be able to pair multiple watches come next week too.
[00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:53.640]   That'll be nice.
[00:51:53.640 --> 00:51:55.640]   Pair multiple watches.
[00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:59.960]   How common is there are some people who buy like a really nice Apple watch and because
[00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:01.760]   $300 is not getting to some sport.
[00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:02.760]   Get a sport.
[00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:05.080]   Yeah, because they want to work out with it because it's light and they don't care
[00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:08.720]   about the band so much.
[00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:11.720]   Kevin Rose should do the watch band podcast, shouldn't he?
[00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:13.160]   Hodyki watch band cast.
[00:52:13.160 --> 00:52:15.000]   And it's such a terrible sight for me.
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:18.840]   Just my wallet cries whenever I felt bad showing you that last week.
[00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:20.120]   Did you buy anything there?
[00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:21.520]   I haven't got the lugs yet though.
[00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:24.320]   They sell lugs that you can get that but let's you put any watch band on your Apple
[00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:25.320]   watch.
[00:52:25.320 --> 00:52:26.320]   Wait a minute.
[00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:27.320]   Wait a minute.
[00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:28.320]   Say that again.
[00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:29.320]   Wait a minute.
[00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:30.320]   Hold on there.
[00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:31.320]   You can get adapted.
[00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:33.360]   So Vincent from Slashgear, I think he was using them and he was putting Panerai and Omega
[00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:35.160]   straps on his Apple watch.
[00:52:35.160 --> 00:52:39.400]   And I just knew that the minute I got those, I would be in bankruptcy.
[00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:41.400]   So does Hodyki sell those?
[00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:42.400]   I don't know.
[00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:45.240]   I think I know you can get them from third parties and they're basically just they have
[00:52:45.240 --> 00:52:51.600]   the Apple lug on one and they have just a regular watch connector on the other hand
[00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:54.760]   so you can put almost any band on it and then just connect it to your Apple watch.
[00:52:54.760 --> 00:52:55.760]   Wow.
[00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:56.760]   Apple lug.
[00:52:56.760 --> 00:52:57.760]   Yeah.
[00:52:57.760 --> 00:53:00.560]   That's a surprise Apple didn't patent that lug.
[00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:04.400]   I think they want like they have a program they made for Apple watch program that still
[00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:08.120]   is in its infancy but eventually like they just wanted as many people as possible making
[00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:09.840]   them made for Apple watch.
[00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:10.840]   Yeah.
[00:53:10.840 --> 00:53:11.840]   Yeah well it's great to have bands.
[00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:13.480]   I mean it's got to be a profit center for them.
[00:53:13.480 --> 00:53:16.920]   But it's nice to have third party bands as well.
[00:53:16.920 --> 00:53:17.920]   Absolutely.
[00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:19.480]   All right.
[00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:24.120]   I guess we've covered let us loop you in.
[00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:26.160]   There is the beautiful invitation.
[00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:30.120]   This is there's nothing in this invitation that we could go old gold.
[00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:31.120]   Not a thing.
[00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:32.120]   A space black silver.
[00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:33.640]   Oh, there's all the colors.
[00:53:33.640 --> 00:53:34.640]   Yeah.
[00:53:34.640 --> 00:53:35.640]   Nothing.
[00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:36.640]   Unless.
[00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:37.640]   No, nothing.
[00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:42.520]   So here's my here's my my my my my Hail Mary prediction.
[00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:43.520]   Oh good.
[00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:44.520]   Let's hear it.
[00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:45.520]   I want to talk about it like that.
[00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:46.520]   That's what I want.
[00:53:46.520 --> 00:53:50.920]   My Hail Mary prediction on the loop you win is that Apple music is going to release loops
[00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:54.160]   and segments that people can remix to make their own versions.
[00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:56.000]   They've just done some contracting.
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:00.560]   I think this week around remixes and licensing and so on so forth with Apple music and I
[00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:06.320]   think that opening that up so that you can download pieces of songs in in a garage band
[00:54:06.320 --> 00:54:09.680]   and it's all part of the Apple music and the trying to figure out what loops would be
[00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:11.560]   and that's the only thing I can think of.
[00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:15.320]   So that's that's that's that are showing they did release a bunch of new loops.
[00:54:15.320 --> 00:54:17.160]   Didn't they with the garage band?
[00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:19.240]   Well, but they also released a bunch.
[00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:25.000]   What if they started what if Apple music subscribers Apple music could download back
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:28.960]   in the early 90s there was a band called the shaman who downloaded what they had to think
[00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:33.680]   called the three records set called Progen and a lot of us that were jocks at the time,
[00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:37.920]   you know, rave jocks were using that because you could you had all the pieces of the songs
[00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:41.280]   and you can actually and then there were like a thousand remixes of of move any mountain
[00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:47.440]   because you had progen and so what if they allowed you know what if they allowed that
[00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:51.440]   what if that was part of your Apple music, you know, it just could be an interesting,
[00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:55.840]   you know, connection and that the chances of that are probably somewhere between one
[00:54:55.840 --> 00:54:59.360]   and two percent but well, that's my that's my Hail Mary.
[00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:03.680]   You know what you're not so far off because Trent Reznor of course is the creative guy
[00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:08.600]   at Beats he's also nine inch nails and it was nine inch nails that open source their tracks.
[00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:10.120]   Remember they gave those away.
[00:55:10.120 --> 00:55:13.120]   Well, not only the open source the track, you know, and they opened up one song where
[00:55:13.120 --> 00:55:17.840]   they they they bounced all the tracks from Pro Tools into GarageBand and it was like
[00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:19.960]   a master's course and how to build a song.
[00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:21.120]   I mean, it was just the most.
[00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:22.120]   Yeah, really.
[00:55:22.120 --> 00:55:26.760]   This gold mine of of how to create music was just looking at how they had created one
[00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:27.920]   of their nine inch nails song.
[00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:30.160]   So, you know, he's the right person to be at Apple.
[00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:31.160]   He gets it.
[00:55:31.160 --> 00:55:32.760]   He's already there, right?
[00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:34.680]   Yeah, so I think he could be the one that pushes it.
[00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:36.280]   So that's that's my guess for loops.
[00:55:36.280 --> 00:55:37.280]   We'll see.
[00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:39.040]   Let me see if I can open this.
[00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:41.600]   I guess I don't have GarageBand on here.
[00:55:41.600 --> 00:55:42.600]   Read me.
[00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:43.600]   DJ for us.
[00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:46.160]   Trent, hello all for quite some time.
[00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:50.160]   I've been interested in the idea of allowing you the ability to tinker around with my tracks.
[00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:52.800]   This is the it was the I think the one of the first to do this.
[00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:56.080]   I don't know about the Pro Gen tracks, but this was 2005.
[00:55:56.080 --> 00:55:59.840]   Well, Pro Gen was before, you know, it was 1990 or 91.
[00:55:59.840 --> 00:56:00.840]   Okay.
[00:56:00.840 --> 00:56:03.600]   It was a long time ago, but it wasn't, you know, it wasn't on in GarageBand.
[00:56:03.600 --> 00:56:08.920]   It was literally a record with with tracks on it that you could spin up.
[00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:11.960]   We'd sample them all into an EME Max and then go from there.
[00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:14.960]   So this was 10 years later.
[00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:17.560]   Sometime of interest in the idea of allowing you the ability to tinker around with my tracks
[00:56:17.560 --> 00:56:20.480]   to create remixes, experiment, embellish or destroy what's there.
[00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:24.560]   I've tried a few years ago to do this in shockwave with very limited results after spending
[00:56:24.560 --> 00:56:28.200]   some quality time sitting in a hotel rooms on a press tour at Donnie.
[00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:29.960]   The technology now exists.
[00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:30.960]   You already have it.
[00:56:30.960 --> 00:56:34.280]   It's called GarageBand.
[00:56:34.280 --> 00:56:39.360]   So he released the multi track audio for the hand that feeds the entire thing bounced over
[00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:41.880]   from the actual Pro Tools session we recorded it into.
[00:56:41.880 --> 00:56:44.960]   I imported and converted the tracks into Apple Loop format for those.
[00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:47.680]   So the size would be reasonable, the tempo flexible.
[00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:54.520]   And if you have GarageBand, he says, he says, drag the file over to your hard disk and
[00:56:54.520 --> 00:56:55.840]   double click it, hit the space bar.
[00:56:55.840 --> 00:56:59.760]   Listen, change the tempo, add new loops, chop up the vocals, turn me into a woman.
[00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:03.240]   Play the guitar, anything you'd like.
[00:57:03.240 --> 00:57:06.040]   Isn't that cool?
[00:57:06.040 --> 00:57:13.040]   I don't know why he says, thanks, Leo in there, but I'm glad to take credit for that.
[00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:14.040]   So very cool.
[00:57:14.040 --> 00:57:16.480]   That's neat.
[00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:17.480]   I just downloaded it.
[00:57:17.480 --> 00:57:18.480]   Let me, I guess I don't have GarageBand.
[00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:20.560]   How could I not have GarageBand on it?
[00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:23.000]   It's built in.
[00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:26.000]   Do you have to drag it into GarageBand?
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:32.800]   Maybe open with, instead of, because it opened in BB Edit, open with, I gotta get my GarageBand.
[00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:34.640]   He's a very old version of GarageBand on it.
[00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:35.880]   Yeah, maybe it doesn't have to be.
[00:57:35.880 --> 00:57:38.400]   Oh, it's gotta be.
[00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:40.320]   Let's open GarageBand and see if I can open them.
[00:57:40.320 --> 00:57:41.800]   Oh, I don't have it.
[00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:42.800]   That's the problem.
[00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:44.200]   Why wouldn't I have it?
[00:57:44.200 --> 00:57:46.600]   Well, it's free, but you have to choose to download it.
[00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:47.600]   Do you?
[00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:48.800]   I think it comes with all your Macs.
[00:57:48.800 --> 00:57:51.360]   Oh, this is a 2012 Mac.
[00:57:51.360 --> 00:57:54.200]   I know it's hard for you to believe I'm using a Mac that old.
[00:57:54.200 --> 00:57:55.200]   I don't believe it.
[00:57:55.200 --> 00:57:56.200]   I know.
[00:57:56.200 --> 00:57:59.200]   I'm just, I like to suffer.
[00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:04.280]   Oh, because you love your stickers, so am I.
[00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:05.280]   It's pretty cool.
[00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:07.120]   We have a nine-inch nails GarageBand.
[00:58:07.120 --> 00:58:08.840]   Yeah, I guess I can't.
[00:58:08.840 --> 00:58:12.320]   If you look at the new licensing that they've been working out with remixes and how a lot
[00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:17.040]   of remixes are starting to come out, they're figuring out all those bits and pieces.
[00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:21.440]   There's a way, I think that there would be a way for metadata to be generated if you
[00:58:21.440 --> 00:58:25.120]   were using GarageBand to be able to download a bunch of pieces and remix them and put
[00:58:25.120 --> 00:58:30.800]   the songs back up on Apple Music and the artists would still get paid for it, which
[00:58:30.800 --> 00:58:35.800]   I think would be interesting because if you use the tools that were licensed against it,
[00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:37.480]   people could be building lots of remixes.
[00:58:37.480 --> 00:58:41.080]   They could do it for the artist that's allow it.
[00:58:41.080 --> 00:58:44.080]   You could end up with a lot of creativity and the artist would still be generating revenue
[00:58:44.080 --> 00:58:45.080]   from that.
[00:58:45.080 --> 00:58:47.160]   In fact, you may, as a user, may not generate revenue from remix.
[00:58:47.160 --> 00:58:51.280]   It may all go to the samples that you're using, but you'd be able to, a lot of people
[00:58:51.280 --> 00:58:53.640]   put up on YouTube, they don't expect to make money on either.
[00:58:53.640 --> 00:59:00.560]   Well, I'll tell you what, I'm going to download GarageBand so we can play with this.
[00:59:00.560 --> 00:59:01.880]   Do we need to call Alex Bakker?
[00:59:01.880 --> 00:59:06.920]   Do you need to turn down your quality on Skype TX, Alex, because your lip sync is bizarre?
[00:59:06.920 --> 00:59:08.720]   It's not Skype TX.
[00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:12.880]   It's on a laptop and it's just, I don't know what Skype is like freaking out.
[00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:15.360]   Yeah, we've been reconnecting a couple of times.
[00:59:15.360 --> 00:59:16.360]   Oh.
[00:59:16.360 --> 00:59:17.360]   Well, no, the sound is great.
[00:59:17.360 --> 00:59:18.360]   The video is great.
[00:59:18.360 --> 00:59:19.360]   It's just kind of the sound.
[00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:20.360]   It's just kind of the sync.
[00:59:20.360 --> 00:59:24.760]   No, it's something about, I don't know what Skype is doing on my computer today that's
[00:59:24.760 --> 00:59:29.960]   different, that it is completely, it's just maxing out all my processors.
[00:59:29.960 --> 00:59:32.200]   You're not using a Surface Book, are you?
[00:59:32.200 --> 00:59:33.200]   No, I'm using it.
[00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:34.200]   I have a retina.
[00:59:34.200 --> 00:59:36.200]   I mean, I'm, you know, no, I'm not.
[00:59:36.200 --> 00:59:38.200]   I like that gas, Renee.
[00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:41.000]   Yeah, that would be it.
[00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:42.000]   Jocky's.
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:44.080]   Hey, am I saying your name wrong?
[00:59:44.080 --> 00:59:45.800]   Somebody tweeted me, I should say Renee.
[00:59:45.800 --> 00:59:48.080]   No, you're not saying it wrong, Leo.
[00:59:48.080 --> 00:59:51.600]   I mean, if you're in Quebec, you say Renee, but I mean, that's totally, no one does that.
[00:59:51.600 --> 00:59:55.440]   So I'm saying it Quebecois, I'm saying with the accent on the name, not the Ren.
[00:59:55.440 --> 00:59:56.920]   No, you're doing fine.
[00:59:56.920 --> 01:00:00.440]   Okay, my sister's middle name was Renee and I always say Renee.
[01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:01.840]   Yeah, totally perfect.
[01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:02.840]   Not Renee.
[01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:03.840]   No.
[01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:09.680]   He said the French class, they taught us that the man is Renee and the woman is Renee.
[01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:13.320]   Yeah, when I was born in South Africa, be Renee.
[01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:14.320]   Renee.
[01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:15.320]   Renee.
[01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:16.320]   Renee.
[01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:19.000]   I'm going to be the Quebecois proper Nance Nation again.
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.000]   Renee.
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.000]   Renee.
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.000]   Renee.
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.000]   Renee.
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:24.000]   Rishi.
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:25.000]   What is it, Renee?
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:26.000]   Renee.
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.000]   Excellent.
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.000]   Oh, Bonjour, Renee.
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.000]   Close the bar.
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:36.440]   Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:37.440]   We're so international, it's amazing.
[01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:40.280]   I can't speak French, I guess.
[01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:42.080]   I just, this is everything like this.
[01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:43.080]   Leopold.
[01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:44.080]   Leopold.
[01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:45.080]   Leopold.
[01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:46.080]   Leopold.
[01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:47.080]   Leopold.
[01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:48.080]   Renee.
[01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:50.880]   We will have more with Renee.
[01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:51.880]   And Cletol.
[01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:52.880]   And Cletol.
[01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:53.880]   Cletol, Marie.
[01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:54.880]   Alex.
[01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:55.880]   Alex.
[01:00:55.880 --> 01:01:01.260]   But first the world from Audibul.
[01:01:01.260 --> 01:01:02.960]   We love his Audibul.
[01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:04.240]   8, 180,000.
[01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:07.240]   Actually, I bet it's more than that now.
[01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:08.840]   Titles in the Audible Collection.
[01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:14.920]   I can just do a search for, I can do a search in the advanced search, Audible, all categories,
[01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:21.960]   all program types, in English, 227,716 books.
[01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:22.960]   Ta-da!
[01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:23.960]   What?
[01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:28.160]   A quarter of a million titles, almost.
[01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:34.520]   And man, everything, you know, from all the Harry Potter books to the latest business
[01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:41.560]   titles, 9,371 business titles, how to win friends and influence people.
[01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:42.560]   The classic.
[01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:44.200]   People tell me, I bet you Clayton.
[01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:47.360]   I bet you you read that book.
[01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:48.360]   You see.
[01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:51.840]   Years ago, my dad had, you know, like a wall of business books growing up.
[01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:53.760]   I definitely read that.
[01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:55.160]   People still say this is a good one.
[01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:57.840]   This is like, everybody should read this book.
[01:01:57.840 --> 01:01:58.840]   You know what?
[01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:00.080]   Business book, everyone should read.
[01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:01.080]   If they haven't already.
[01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:02.080]   But.
[01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:03.240]   Maybe it's just because I'm a real estate nut.
[01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:04.840]   But is Rich Dad poor dad?
[01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:06.480]   Oh, they got that.
[01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:07.480]   That's a great book.
[01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:08.600]   I actually read that one.
[01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:13.200]   What the rich teach their kids about money that the poor and middle class do not.
[01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:14.640]   Robert Kiyosaki.
[01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:17.840]   If this, I'll throw this down to all the Mac break audience.
[01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:21.680]   If this book doesn't change your life in some way, I would be shocked.
[01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:25.920]   If you haven't already read it, if it doesn't totally shift the way that you see investing
[01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:30.280]   and, you know, saving for retirement, you know, most people are sort of lied to believing
[01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:34.080]   that the 401k plan is like the way to, you know, to settle for retirement.
[01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:35.640]   It's not totally change everything.
[01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:36.640]   Oh, I'm screwed.
[01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:37.640]   Really?
[01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:41.840]   I mean, the average 401k plan when people retire is like $70,000.
[01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:44.240]   Yeah, that's not going to do anything for you.
[01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:47.280]   Oh, I can't live at $70,000.
[01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:48.440]   Audibles.com.
[01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:51.040]   Here's the deal.
[01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:52.400]   You can get this first book free.
[01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:54.720]   So I mean, there's lots of things.
[01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:57.240]   The problem is choosing the first one there.
[01:02:57.240 --> 01:02:59.600]   But then what we're going to do is sign you up for the gold account.
[01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:01.760]   That's a book a month.
[01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:02.760]   And every month the best.
[01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:05.880]   Oh, Emma Thompson narrating the turn of the screw.
[01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:06.880]   Wow.
[01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:08.920]   Holy cow.
[01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:11.800]   That's something they've been doing audible has been doing lately, which is taking classes
[01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:20.200]   six and having famous people like Scarlett Johansson doing Alice in Wonderland read these.
[01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:22.200]   And it's just, it's just so fun.
[01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:25.680]   Here's something like Richard Armatage doing David Copperfield.
[01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:28.520]   Let me play a little bit of this.
[01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:29.520]   Just.
[01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:30.760]   Hello, David.
[01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:31.760]   Hello.
[01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:32.760]   Are you there?
[01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:34.280]   That's not coming up.
[01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:35.280]   That's a nice thing, by the way.
[01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:41.760]   If you go to audible.com, you can listen to a book before you listen to the book.
[01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:43.480]   In other words, you can play a little excerpt of it.
[01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:44.480]   See if you like the reader.
[01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:46.000]   See if you like the style.
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:49.200]   This first book, it's kind of important, especially if you've been wondering, I don't
[01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:50.440]   know, is audio book for me.
[01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:52.720]   I don't know if I'm going to like them.
[01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:56.560]   Pick a book that you, you know, you go like, oh, you know, something fun.
[01:03:56.560 --> 01:03:59.320]   A season, sorry, he's newest, modern romance.
[01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:00.320]   That'd be fun.
[01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:01.320]   He's in it.
[01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:02.320]   He reads it.
[01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:03.320]   Tina Fey's bossy pants.
[01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:04.960]   She reads it.
[01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:09.120]   It's like it's like having a five hour set in that life on your commute.
[01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:16.120]   If you don't know, you can't go to a five hour set in that life.
[01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:22.120]   You can go to audible.com/macbreakaudible.com/macbreak.
[01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:29.560]   Oh, look, Mindy Kaling, is everyone hanging out without me and other concerns?
[01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:30.560]   Amy Poehler.
[01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:33.400]   Yes, please.
[01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:37.800]   Not only does Amy Poehler read it, but she's brought in Carol Burnett, Seth Meyers, Kathleen
[01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:39.240]   Turner, Patrick Stewart.
[01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:43.000]   That's one of the things I love about Audible is when you get these big casts and you get
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.440]   the full cast performances.
[01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:46.840]   It's so much fun.
[01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:51.160]   Really, the toughest thing is picking a book, but we've given you some good choices, including
[01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:52.160]   Rich Dad, Poor Dad.
[01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:54.600]   That would be a great starting point.
[01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:55.600]   Audible.com/macbreak.
[01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:56.960]   You'll sign up for the gold account.
[01:04:56.960 --> 01:05:02.000]   That's a book a month plus the Daily Digest of the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.

[01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:08.360]   or doing the dishes.
[01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:11.920]   I listened to Audible books during all of the above, mostly because my commute is seven
[01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:12.920]   minutes.
[01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:19.840]   With a seven minute commute, I really got to find other places to listen.
[01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:23.920]   I used to have at least two hours a day in the car, and I missed that.
[01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:26.280]   I downloaded the expanse for the trip out to Koopa.
[01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:27.280]   Expanse is awesome.
[01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:28.280]   Have you been watching it?
[01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:30.480]   I watched it, and then I was like, but, but, but, but, but, listen.
[01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:31.480]   I downloaded the books now.
[01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:34.840]   Yeah, don't watch anymore until you read.
[01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:37.160]   But there's quite a few of those, the expanse series.
[01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:38.160]   Is that a trilogy?
[01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:39.160]   I think it's a trilogy.
[01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:41.160]   I think it's a trilogy, but they're doing more.
[01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:42.160]   But then there's more, yeah.
[01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:43.160]   Yeah.
[01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:44.160]   He's doing more.
[01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:45.160]   I love Audible.
[01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:46.160]   I don't know.
[01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:47.160]   I always want to give him more time.
[01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:48.560]   Wait a minute.
[01:05:48.560 --> 01:05:50.880]   Mycroft Holmes by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.
[01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:51.880]   What?
[01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:52.880]   What?
[01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:53.880]   Hey.
[01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:57.000]   Hey, I told you they have everything.
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.400]   It's amazing.
[01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:04.760]   Apparently, Kareem is like a homesie, and he's like, totally, totally, totally, totally,
[01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:05.760]   into Sherlock Holmes.
[01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:09.560]   And so he decided to write a Sherlock Holmes novel.
[01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:10.560]   What?
[01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:11.720]   Might be good.
[01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:13.240]   That was great.
[01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:17.880]   If you read, if you watch "Trombo," you saw the movie, "Read the Book."
[01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:18.880]   That's the other thing.
[01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:20.800]   I love to read the books before I see the movies.
[01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:24.280]   I don't know why, but I just, I feel like the book is always going to give me, yeah.
[01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:26.280]   Give me more.
[01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:27.280]   Audible.com/MacBreak.
[01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:31.480]   It's all yours.
[01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:34.720]   Audible.com/MacBreakOff or good in the US and Canada.
[01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:37.880]   Zane Lowe.
[01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:39.880]   Do we care about Zane Lowe?
[01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:41.560]   Do we listen to Beats One religiously?
[01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:42.560]   Breaking worldwide.
[01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:43.560]   24/7.
[01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:51.440]   He's discussing Apple Music, Beats One, Steve Jobs and Mo in an incredible interview with
[01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:53.400]   Noisei.
[01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:58.240]   I feel like when I hear this stuff and read this stuff, I'm just not, I'm too old, I guess.
[01:06:58.240 --> 01:06:59.320]   I just missed it.
[01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:03.640]   Why don't they have like an hour of Beats One devoted to classical music?
[01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:06.800]   Well, they did get the Beats Two, Beats Three, Beats Three.
[01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:08.680]   Are they going to do it though?
[01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:09.680]   I don't know.
[01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:11.680]   They own the name.
[01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:12.680]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:18.040]   And I think Trent Reiser has said that he modeled it after BBC One when he was in England.
[01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:19.680]   And you know, they obviously have more than one of these.
[01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:20.680]   There's BBC Two, Three and Four.
[01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:22.520]   I love BBC Four.
[01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:25.520]   So it would be nice if they did that actually.
[01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:27.480]   Are you guys still listening to Beats One?
[01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:32.320]   I mean, after sort of the initial rush of it, I kind of, I thought it was, I learned a
[01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:35.480]   lot of new music as a result of it, but I just don't think to do it.
[01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:37.520]   I've got podcasts that are listening to you.
[01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:39.480]   I just put it on when I don't have anything else to listen to.
[01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:40.480]   Yeah.
[01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:42.840]   Or if I'm just sitting there working and I don't want to be distracted, I just hit it and I
[01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:43.840]   had listening.
[01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:47.720]   I keep getting Julianna Tannuga and nothing against Julianna Tannuga, but she's a little
[01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:49.520]   over excited.
[01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:50.520]   So excited, Leo.
[01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:53.640]   So happy you're listening.
[01:07:53.640 --> 01:08:00.240]   After a while, it's like, okay.
[01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:03.520]   So how about Apple Music Clayton?
[01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:04.680]   Are you listening to Apple Music?
[01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:05.920]   I mean, did you subscribe?
[01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:07.360]   Yeah, I subscribe.
[01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:08.360]   That's the one we use.
[01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:13.720]   We have the family, the family share so that my wife can play Hamilton soundtrack, non-stop
[01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:14.960]   and other show tunes.
[01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:17.000]   I play that on Spotify.
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.000]   The greatest thing.
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.000]   Oh, no, Google music.
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:20.000]   I play that on Google music.
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:21.000]   I'm sorry.
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:22.000]   I have it.
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:23.000]   I'll play it through the Sonos.
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.880]   And now, you know, to me, the killer was that Sonos added Apple music.
[01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:27.400]   That was one step.
[01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:28.400]   That's critical.
[01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:29.400]   Yeah.
[01:08:29.400 --> 01:08:32.120]   Although, I worry about Sonos.
[01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:35.120]   They had layoffs.
[01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:38.480]   They were very clever in their press release to say, we're going to lay off people.
[01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:41.520]   Oh, by the way, we're going to be streaming and voice.
[01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:44.000]   That's the next big thing and we're going to do that.
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.440]   But I worry because I think competition is getting intense.
[01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:50.600]   They make a very nice product with a very high price product and others are doing similar
[01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:56.160]   things and not having echo style voice is kind of going to hurt them, I think, in the
[01:08:56.160 --> 01:08:57.160]   long run.
[01:08:57.160 --> 01:08:59.160]   I love the Sonos app.
[01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:00.160]   That's terrible.
[01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:02.160]   I love Sonos, but it really is a pain in the butt.
[01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:04.400]   I mean, it's not intuitive at all.
[01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:06.320]   Like I'm saving something to my Sonos favorites.
[01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:07.320]   Wait a second.
[01:09:07.320 --> 01:09:08.320]   Is that okay?
[01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:12.160]   But it's not recognizing it over here, but I'm all out of cap on how many things I can
[01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:13.640]   save to my favorites.
[01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:15.080]   But okay, I can save a podcast.
[01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:16.360]   But what about a channel?
[01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:17.880]   This channel is not right.
[01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:19.040]   It's really cludgy.
[01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:22.440]   You know, and the services are not distinguishable too.
[01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:27.120]   So you add Apple music into the Sonos app and it just kind of, you know, just melded
[01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:28.120]   into the other ones.
[01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:29.840]   You don't get the Apple music interface anymore.
[01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:32.840]   You get this really funky text heavy face.
[01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:33.840]   Right.
[01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:39.360]   Which, you know, the music, I think the Apple music interface is also burdensome.
[01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:43.120]   You know, that's why Siri, I think what Apple music and Siri is so great.
[01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:46.320]   You know, we're driving the kids say, Hey, they know that I love 80s music.
[01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:47.320]   There's a use case.
[01:09:47.320 --> 01:09:48.320]   Yeah.
[01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:49.320]   Hey, you know, play.
[01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:50.320]   Holla notes.
[01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:51.320]   Greatest hits.
[01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:52.320]   Oh God, please.
[01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:53.320]   No, no, no.
[01:09:53.320 --> 01:09:54.680]   Hey, it's the full sound of all notes.
[01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:56.160]   I can't go for that.
[01:09:56.160 --> 01:10:00.040]   I can't complain because I have that actually in my Apple music.
[01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:02.120]   Not, not, I bought it.
[01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:03.120]   Yeah.
[01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:04.120]   Not me personally.
[01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:07.520]   My wife, my better half.
[01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:09.400]   She loves the 80s music too.
[01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:13.000]   I had fun because I left straight out of Compton and I just, I was in the car and I
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.160]   started asking Siri to play every song I remember.
[01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:16.160]   Isn't that nice?
[01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:17.160]   Childhood.
[01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:18.160]   Yeah.
[01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:19.160]   I didn't have to look for CDs.
[01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:20.160]   Right.
[01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:21.160]   I didn't have to try it down.
[01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:22.280]   They just played one after the other, all these albums that I, and it was so nostalgic and
[01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:23.280]   so immediate.
[01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:25.040]   Well, and the Hamilton's a very good example.
[01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:29.360]   Well, I feel guilty because I feel like, well, shouldn't I just buy this album instead of
[01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:30.360]   listening to it?
[01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:32.720]   But I don't need to buy it because it's on whatever.
[01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:33.720]   I think it's Google.
[01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:37.200]   I buy it to support them, but then I still just asked Siri to play it and just plays.
[01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:38.200]   Right.
[01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:44.200]   So that is, by the way, that is, you know, a strong argument for any streaming music,
[01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:51.920]   but I have to say if, if you, if you have an echo and the new dot and you tie it into
[01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:56.560]   a stereo system, being able to talk to your, I mean, Siri, that's what's great about
[01:10:56.560 --> 01:10:57.560]   it, right?
[01:10:57.560 --> 01:10:58.560]   You could talk to Siri.
[01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:01.760]   Being able to ask for stuff and having a play is awesome and I want that in my house.
[01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:04.520]   And the great thing, and I hate to be that guy all the time, but Apple Music launched
[01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:08.160]   in a hundred countries and you know, you've got Siri in many, many countries now.
[01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:09.680]   So it's like, you can use that.
[01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:10.680]   That's true.
[01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:11.680]   So many places.
[01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:14.160]   You say that as a Canadian knowing that you're left out so often.
[01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:15.160]   Yeah.
[01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:16.160]   Absolutely.
[01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:17.160]   Like we don't have any of the Amazon stuff still.
[01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:18.160]   That's really cool.
[01:11:18.160 --> 01:11:19.280]   But I have, we have all the iTunes stuff.
[01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:21.200]   We have all the Apple Music stuff, all the Siri stuff.
[01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:22.200]   That's great.
[01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:24.320]   You know what, the dark horse, and I think the thing that could actually kill Sonos is
[01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:26.800]   Google Chromecast audio.
[01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:29.960]   It has multi-room and then you don't have to deal with a bad interface because you're
[01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:32.240]   doing it on your phone.
[01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:36.960]   So you open whatever app you want and you like Spotify or Google Music and you, and
[01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:38.160]   you say, oh, there it is.
[01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:39.160]   There's it.
[01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:40.160]   You have that full interface.
[01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:41.160]   Doesn't, I don't think it works with Apple Music.
[01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:44.880]   You have that full interface and you just say, I could play it in, you know, to the Chromecast
[01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:47.840]   audio attached to my stereo or whatever else.
[01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:51.720]   I have them on all my stereos and speakers and everything everywhere.
[01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:55.020]   I run about that, I think a year ago, where I would really love, like I love the new Apple
[01:11:55.020 --> 01:12:00.040]   TV, but I would really like an AirPlay device, like a little AirPlay dongle that has all the
[01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:01.040]   logic on the phone.
[01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:03.640]   I could just attach that to any speakers, just to any TV.
[01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:04.640]   Nobody makes that one.
[01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:08.360]   Well, Apple would need to make it because, you know, Apple's still a very, a very, very
[01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:09.960]   proprietary system.
[01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:13.560]   And they, right now, this solution is the Apple TV, but I don't need that for a lot of
[01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:14.560]   the stuff that I want.
[01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:17.560]   I could just very easily put a dongle in there and use everything that's built into
[01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:20.520]   the phone to stream stuff directly to my TV.
[01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:25.080]   I wish, you know, I wish Sonos, if Sonos had an ability to add AirPlay, I mean, they do
[01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:31.280]   with that Clue G setup where you stick the airport, the Apple Express, the Apple Express.
[01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:36.800]   Yeah, and you connect it and put the little 32 millimeter headphone jack with it, you know,
[01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:37.800]   connect your phone that way.
[01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:41.400]   I mean, that's, that, that, you know, but to be able to add AirPlay, I've tried some
[01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:45.240]   of the different AirPlay speakers and it's, they're kind of hit or miss.
[01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:49.040]   They kind of show up once in a while from your AirPlay menu and you're like, why?
[01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:50.400]   I'm standing right in front of it.
[01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:53.120]   It's right next to the router and it's not showing up on AirPlay.
[01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:56.160]   And so when you, in those moments where you want to just play an album, why you're getting
[01:12:56.160 --> 01:13:00.160]   ready to go out, you know, and you're upstairs and you're getting showered and it's not working.
[01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:03.520]   You just kind of put the phone down on your sink and you just start listening to stuff,
[01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:05.240]   you know, on phone instead of it.
[01:13:05.240 --> 01:13:09.840]   And I found that, that, you know, I have a couple of Sonos speakers and what my wife
[01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:15.640]   uses constantly is I got her one of those ultimate ears, like boom, tower things or whatever.
[01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:21.720]   And you just carried around, you set it down, it, it pairs to multiple phones over Bluetooth.
[01:13:21.720 --> 01:13:24.480]   It's like old fashioned and, and it works.
[01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:27.200]   Like you, oh, I want to listen to NPR and I want to listen to NPR while I'm washing the
[01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:28.200]   dishes.
[01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:31.160]   I turn it on, you know, and I want to, you know, and I don't have to, you know, I don't
[01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:32.240]   have to figure it out out.
[01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:36.720]   I don't have to separate app and so I have to admit the Sonos that we haven't, we started
[01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:39.520]   getting it all set up and then we got that and then we stopped doing.
[01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:42.960]   Here's what I bought, which I'm not necessarily recommending, but I do it.
[01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:44.160]   It does airplay.
[01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:45.160]   It does Bluetooth.
[01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:47.160]   It does DLNA.
[01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:50.040]   It has, it even has a phono jack.
[01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:52.920]   It has every possible input and that's why I got it.
[01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:56.040]   So I can stream to it from anything in any way, in any form.
[01:13:56.040 --> 01:14:00.800]   And of course, as soon as I get my dot, this is the thing that dot's going to go on.
[01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:02.520]   It's from JBL.
[01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:07.600]   And you know, it's fun about it is it looks like the old century JBL century speakers.
[01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:10.200]   You guys, I know some of you did radio in the old days.
[01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:12.400]   Remember those century series speakers?
[01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:14.520]   Every studio had them.
[01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:19.960]   And so they've duplicated the kind of weird look of it.
[01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:20.960]   It's pricey.
[01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:21.960]   It's a thousand bucks.
[01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:22.960]   But I got it on a sale.
[01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:26.600]   It was like 800, but even at 800, I think it's a little pricey.
[01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:27.600]   Sounds great.
[01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:31.400]   And the fact that I can just anything, I can airplay to it.
[01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:32.800]   I can do anything.
[01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:37.040]   It's like I have a Chromecast audio hooked into the optical jack also.
[01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:40.520]   So it supports just pretty much like every possible.
[01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:43.840]   Do you guys see Pokes piece on the Dolby Atmos sound bar?
[01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:44.840]   No.
[01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:45.840]   Tell me about that.
[01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:46.840]   It looks amazing.
[01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:51.520]   So it's a sound bar Yamaha makes that I think it starts at 1500 and it's full Dolby Atmos.
[01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:54.360]   So which means it comes from above as well as around, right?
[01:14:54.360 --> 01:14:55.360]   Absolutely.
[01:14:55.360 --> 01:14:56.360]   And it simulates it.
[01:14:56.360 --> 01:14:58.920]   The only thing is you have to have a room where it can bounce signals off the roof, both
[01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:00.160]   walls in the back.
[01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:03.240]   So what it does is you have to sit in a very specific place where you tune it.
[01:15:03.240 --> 01:15:06.560]   But then from the sound bar and it has a ton of speakers in it, it'll bounce up and
[01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:11.960]   down and on both sides to give you that entire 360 sort of cinematic sound.
[01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:14.640]   And yeah, that's sort of like not everyone has a room that's ideal to it.
[01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:18.080]   But I like that that technology is starting to make us way into the home.
[01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:20.280]   That's a super immersive experience.
[01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:23.280]   That was a very expensive thing you just said for me.
[01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:24.920]   Somebody wants the OV at most.
[01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:28.640]   Wait a minute before you buy it.
[01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:31.080]   Do blue rays come with atmos on them?
[01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:33.120]   I mean, what source are you using?
[01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:34.680]   We always bother about the source.
[01:15:34.680 --> 01:15:36.680]   We figure that out later.
[01:15:36.680 --> 01:15:39.200]   We buy the 4K TV and then we think about it.
[01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:43.040]   I mean, let's, you know, okay, I guess you could simulate it.
[01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:45.680]   I'm an HDR TV with atmos and nothing to play on it, but I'll have it.
[01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:46.680]   You'll have it.
[01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:47.680]   You'll be ready.
[01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:48.680]   Actually, you're right.
[01:15:48.680 --> 01:15:55.600]   When you upgrade to UHD HDR, the UHD premium TV set, actually it might as well just get
[01:15:55.600 --> 01:15:56.600]   the LG OLED.
[01:15:56.600 --> 01:15:57.600]   Yeah.
[01:15:57.600 --> 01:15:58.600]   It's only $8,000.
[01:15:58.600 --> 01:15:59.600]   It's not that.
[01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:00.600]   So, so jealous.
[01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:02.760]   Yeah, your boss probably because he buy all those expensive stuffs.
[01:16:02.760 --> 01:16:06.360]   Derek Kessler, who used to run WebOS Nation, he figured that's the last remaining bit of
[01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:07.720]   WebOS in the world and he wanted to.
[01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:08.720]   It is.
[01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:09.720]   It's running WebOS.
[01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:10.720]   He's right.
[01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:11.720]   He has to buy it.
[01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:14.440]   Damn, why wasn't I working for that magazine?
[01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:18.000]   And then if you're going to buy that, well, you got to get atmos 7.1 atmos sound.
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:19.000]   Yeah.
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.080]   I mean, you spent $8,000 on a TV.
[01:16:21.080 --> 01:16:23.600]   That's how this works.
[01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:28.440]   This is going to run over and strangle me in a second.
[01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:32.720]   I see here on the Dolby Atmos website, there is a growing library of content.
[01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:37.160]   It's like HDR on the Visio website.
[01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:40.120]   Growing library of content.
[01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:42.040]   The age of adrenaline.
[01:16:42.040 --> 01:16:43.040]   Amazing Spider-Man 2.
[01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:44.040]   Amazing Spider-Man.
[01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:45.040]   Yeah.
[01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:46.680]   We're happy.
[01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:48.120]   Enchanted Kingdom.
[01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:49.640]   The Expendables 3.
[01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:53.240]   Oh, the fifth element Supreme Cinema version.
[01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:55.200]   I have to buy a new copy.
[01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:56.680]   That's like here.
[01:16:56.680 --> 01:16:57.680]   That would be one.
[01:16:57.680 --> 01:16:58.680]   Yeah.
[01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:02.680]   Now we're talking Game of Thrones, the complete first and second season.
[01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:06.240]   Da, da, da, da, coming from above you.
[01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:08.160]   Da, da, da, da, da, da, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.
[01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:09.160]   Hancock.
[01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:11.320]   Oh, who doesn't love that?
[01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:12.960]   Was that Wickety Wog guy?
[01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:13.960]   Will Smith.
[01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:14.960]   Yeah.
[01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:17.040]   I call him Wickety Wog guy.
[01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:19.040]   The Hunger Games Part 1, Insurgence.
[01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:20.760]   Oh, here's a great movie.
[01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:22.760]   Jupiter is sending.
[01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:23.760]   John Wick.
[01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:24.760]   John Wick.
[01:17:24.760 --> 01:17:25.760]   That was the worst.
[01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:27.440]   Keanna Reeves is not an action hero.
[01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:29.420]   I'm sorry.
[01:17:29.420 --> 01:17:30.760]   Leon.
[01:17:30.760 --> 01:17:35.200]   Leon Mad Max for your road.
[01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:36.200]   That would be great.
[01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:37.200]   Okay.
[01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:39.000]   I would get it just for that.
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:40.640]   Minions.
[01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:42.280]   Mission Impossible Rogue Nation.
[01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:45.000]   That was actually surprisingly the wall.
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.600]   Roger Waters, the wall.
[01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:48.600]   The Smurfs too.
[01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:49.600]   I mean, oh, yeah.
[01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:50.600]   The Smurfs too.
[01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:51.600]   I mean, that that has to be.
[01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:52.600]   You know what?
[01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:54.320]   We talked about it on Sunday with Scott Wilkinson.
[01:17:54.320 --> 01:18:00.120]   He says that is the UHD disk to get the best UHD disk out there.
[01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:05.560]   I said, this is the problem with his stuff is you don't care about what you're watching.
[01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:06.560]   It looks so good.
[01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:07.560]   It looks so good.
[01:18:07.560 --> 01:18:09.880]   It's the Smurfs.
[01:18:09.880 --> 01:18:11.480]   Not even the Smurfs one.
[01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:12.480]   The Smurfs two.
[01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:30.080]   I guess the
[01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:31.080]   is.
[01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:33.400]   I can't do it.
[01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:34.400]   It's from Sony.
[01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:35.400]   That explains it, right?
[01:18:35.400 --> 01:18:39.440]   That's why because Sony selling that new blue, blue, gray player.
[01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:42.920]   Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
[01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:45.920]   Sony always has these weird proprietary formats.
[01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:47.720]   I bet these are almost all Sony titles.
[01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:48.720]   What do you bet?
[01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:49.720]   I'm guessing.
[01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:50.720]   Yeah.
[01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:51.720]   That's okay.
[01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:53.240]   We can live with it.
[01:18:53.240 --> 01:18:55.200]   Sony is this week.
[01:18:55.200 --> 01:18:59.920]   In fact, we're going to be covering the GDC, the Game Developers Conference tomorrow.
[01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:05.640]   The Robert and Chad Johnson will be doing our coverage from GDC.
[01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:14.280]   Sony is going to announce tomorrow availability for its VR for PlayStation 4.
[01:19:14.280 --> 01:19:20.600]   That is going to be very interesting because only a small tiny fraction of Windows computer
[01:19:20.600 --> 01:19:22.760]   owners can run Oculus Rift.
[01:19:22.760 --> 01:19:25.640]   Yeah, I ordered the Oculus storage order, the HTC Vive.
[01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:27.120]   So how many more of these things we have to buy?
[01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:28.680]   I bought the Vive and the Oculus.
[01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:32.800]   I guess I have to buy a PlayStation 4 just to run the Sony VR.
[01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:33.800]   But this is the next...
[01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:34.800]   Don't you think the next big thing?
[01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:36.800]   They only have one head.
[01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:39.560]   But they all do different things.
[01:19:39.560 --> 01:19:42.840]   I think that that's the interesting thing is they all have slightly different takes.
[01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:45.560]   I may have most of them.
[01:19:45.560 --> 01:19:49.000]   You don't wonder why.
[01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:50.000]   Yeah.
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:53.740]   But some of the interactive, when you start getting ahold of things and you can imagine
[01:19:53.740 --> 01:19:58.120]   when you start getting gloves, how a lot of this stuff is going to get really interesting.
[01:19:58.120 --> 01:20:01.160]   So the event is tonight at 5pm Eastern.
[01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:03.600]   It's actually soon.
[01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:05.200]   It's in 45 minutes.
[01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:06.200]   Wow.
[01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:08.120]   Let's stop the show and just stream that live.
[01:20:08.120 --> 01:20:09.120]   We'll just watch it.
[01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:10.120]   No, I'm sorry.
[01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:11.120]   It's not in 45 minutes.
[01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:15.640]   It's in two hours of 45 minutes.
[01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:16.640]   Daylight savings time.
[01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:18.280]   Screw me up.
[01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:19.760]   Saving time.
[01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:21.560]   Saving, no.
[01:20:21.560 --> 01:20:22.560]   You know, worst.
[01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:27.160]   I know why John Slalina took this week off because he hates it when I say savings.
[01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:29.160]   Apparently you know this too, Clayton.
[01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:33.680]   Oh, it's my, I often joke on the air that if, if I run for president's going to be on
[01:20:33.680 --> 01:20:38.120]   my only platform, my only policy platform is to get rid of daily saving time.
[01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:39.120]   Stomp it in.
[01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:40.120]   Yeah.
[01:20:40.120 --> 01:20:44.440]   I mean, that's when I see like lower third graphics and, you know, new stations that
[01:20:44.440 --> 01:20:47.800]   like, don't forget to turn your clocks at one, you know, one hour ahead.
[01:20:47.800 --> 01:20:48.800]   It's daylight savings time.
[01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:50.120]   They put the S in there.
[01:20:50.120 --> 01:20:51.120]   No.
[01:20:51.120 --> 01:20:52.880]   Why is there no S?
[01:20:52.880 --> 01:20:57.640]   Because it's daylight is singular.
[01:20:57.640 --> 01:20:58.640]   You're only getting once.
[01:20:58.640 --> 01:20:59.640]   You're only saving.
[01:20:59.640 --> 01:21:02.520]   There's actually when they take an hour away from me, there is no savings there.
[01:21:02.520 --> 01:21:03.520]   That's all I'm saying.
[01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:04.520]   It's not saving nothing.
[01:21:04.520 --> 01:21:05.520]   It's not saving.
[01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:06.520]   Nothing.
[01:21:06.520 --> 01:21:07.520]   They like losing.
[01:21:07.520 --> 01:21:11.320]   So what my hour back website, stop DST.com.
[01:21:11.320 --> 01:21:12.800]   We do this every six months.
[01:21:12.800 --> 01:21:14.560]   You know, one of these days it'll take.
[01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:15.560]   All right.
[01:21:15.560 --> 01:21:17.920]   Look, hashtag stop DST.
[01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:19.440]   The Germans created it.
[01:21:19.440 --> 01:21:24.080]   It's a product of World War one in order to save coal that it was it was resuscitated
[01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:26.560]   during the 1970s energy crisis.
[01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:29.840]   We're not in the middle of an energy crisis or buy an SUV's again because they forgot
[01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:32.160]   they have such short term, you know, memory loss.
[01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:33.160]   Right.
[01:21:33.160 --> 01:21:35.160]   George W. Bush screwed everything up.
[01:21:35.160 --> 01:21:37.160]   Yes, it's cheap.
[01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:43.160]   Seventeen percent rise in fatal traffic fatalities, fatal traffic accidents on yesterday.
[01:21:43.160 --> 01:21:44.160]   Yeah.
[01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:47.040]   Nine million dollars in additional cost in Indiana alone.
[01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:49.280]   See, it doesn't even save energy.
[01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:54.760]   68 percent increase in days lost due to workplace injury on the Monday following.
[01:21:54.760 --> 01:21:56.800]   Did you get hurt yesterday?
[01:21:56.800 --> 01:21:57.800]   Thank you.
[01:21:57.800 --> 01:21:58.800]   Like saving time.
[01:21:58.800 --> 01:21:59.800]   I did.
[01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:04.640]   They see an uptick in heart attacks because of the like 25 percent increase in heart attacks.
[01:22:04.640 --> 01:22:06.400]   See, it's killing people.
[01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:07.400]   Govers.
[01:22:07.400 --> 01:22:08.400]   Oh my gosh.
[01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:09.400]   I'm getting encryption.
[01:22:09.400 --> 01:22:10.400]   This is a national debacle.
[01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:14.240]   You know, but we, but this is the short memory thing you were talking about Clayton because
[01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:15.840]   in a week, nobody will care.
[01:22:15.840 --> 01:22:16.840]   Right.
[01:22:16.840 --> 01:22:18.720]   And then we'll have to wait till next time.
[01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:21.560]   Although I think there are some, there are some states that are now, I think there's
[01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:26.080]   five states that are, that are, that the legislation is actually snaking its way through
[01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:30.440]   the process of, you know, like let's follow Arizona and actually be reasonable and just
[01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:32.600]   not not do this anymore.
[01:22:32.600 --> 01:22:33.600]   Yeah.
[01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:36.520]   That's the only thing about Arizona that I think is reasonable in the end.
[01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:37.520]   It doesn't do it as well.
[01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:39.320]   Well, there's certain sections of India.
[01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:40.320]   Parts of India.
[01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:41.320]   Which is so weird.
[01:22:41.320 --> 01:22:46.120]   So you can get up and be on time for work and drive to work and then be late to work because
[01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:47.600]   you cross the time zone.
[01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:49.000]   I actually went and did a story on this.
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:54.560]   I flew in Indiana one time years ago to do a story and I was there in one time zone and
[01:22:54.560 --> 01:22:57.480]   people, you know, would drive and then it would leave work on time.
[01:22:57.480 --> 01:23:00.840]   They would almost like get an hour back when they were coming home for the day.
[01:23:00.840 --> 01:23:01.840]   It's so bizarre.
[01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:06.960]   Well, the weird thing in Arizona that while the state of Arizona doesn't observe the Navajo
[01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:08.640]   nation does.
[01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:11.480]   So sorry, that's absurd.
[01:23:11.480 --> 01:23:13.040]   Newfoundland is on a half hour time zone.
[01:23:13.040 --> 01:23:14.040]   We just need to fix it.
[01:23:14.040 --> 01:23:15.040]   That's another bad one.
[01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:16.040]   Don't half hour.
[01:23:16.040 --> 01:23:17.040]   No, there's quarter hour time zones.
[01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:18.040]   Why?
[01:23:18.040 --> 01:23:19.040]   Don't stop the insanity.
[01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:20.040]   I am on the radical.
[01:23:20.040 --> 01:23:24.280]   I'm almost expecting to say to you because it goes right down the middle of the country
[01:23:24.280 --> 01:23:25.680]   and then just say, okay, we're all going.
[01:23:25.680 --> 01:23:26.680]   I'm a radical.
[01:23:26.680 --> 01:23:28.600]   I think there should be no time zones.
[01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:29.600]   I do.
[01:23:29.600 --> 01:23:30.600]   I do.
[01:23:30.600 --> 01:23:31.600]   I do.
[01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:32.600]   I do.
[01:23:32.600 --> 01:23:33.600]   Zulu.
[01:23:33.600 --> 01:23:34.600]   Zulu.
[01:23:34.600 --> 01:23:35.600]   And just adjust your idea of what daytime is.
[01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:36.600]   It's whatever the sun is out.
[01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:37.600]   Right.
[01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:38.600]   Yes.
[01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:39.600]   Thomas Jefferson style.
[01:23:39.600 --> 01:23:40.600]   Yeah.
[01:23:40.600 --> 01:23:41.600]   I'm all for that.
[01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:43.520]   We did Thomas Jefferson.
[01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:45.240]   There you go.
[01:23:45.240 --> 01:23:51.120]   So it is your sense of American history modified at all by your by Hamilton claim?
[01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:56.920]   I mean, there are there are a few inaccuracies that aren't true to the Ron Chernow book.
[01:23:56.920 --> 01:23:57.920]   I love that book.
[01:23:57.920 --> 01:24:00.400]   I'm reading that book now so I can see the show.
[01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:01.400]   It's great.
[01:24:01.400 --> 01:24:06.280]   So some of the relationships like Hercules Mulligan and some of the other guys that Hamilton
[01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:11.360]   befriended during his time in New York didn't exactly happen in one afternoon.
[01:24:11.360 --> 01:24:12.360]   Right.
[01:24:12.360 --> 01:24:14.320]   And he's just spot on.
[01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:16.360]   And yeah, and it's great.
[01:24:16.360 --> 01:24:20.320]   I mean, and I love the set up sort of explaining duels in America.
[01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:26.360]   They, you know, I know they have the 10 dual commandments based on the 10 crack commandments.
[01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:27.360]   Great.
[01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:28.360]   Yeah.
[01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:35.800]   Well, you have to explain duels because it seems insane, frankly, the modern modern Americans.
[01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:36.800]   It's insane.
[01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:40.360]   I mean, you have to set it up there and explain it in the storyline so that when we get to
[01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:44.080]   where everyone knows what happens to Alexander Hamilton, then you know, supposed to happen
[01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:45.080]   actually in pool halls.
[01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:49.440]   I mean, that's how we do it these days to pool cues.
[01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:51.360]   He was at the ready.
[01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:53.400]   They don't have the overhead anymore.
[01:24:53.400 --> 01:24:59.480]   So a good article, by the way, Renee and I'm more what no indie developer wants to hear
[01:24:59.480 --> 01:25:00.480]   about the app store.
[01:25:00.480 --> 01:25:04.520]   That's part of the show we did two weeks ago when we were just talking about apps.
[01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:05.520]   Yeah.
[01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:07.560]   So you kind of summarize the issues.
[01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:13.280]   Yeah, or at least one aspect of it, one perception of it.
[01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:20.080]   Well, the issue that if you're an indie app developer, it doesn't look good.
[01:25:20.080 --> 01:25:23.800]   It looks good in specific like there'll always be niches in every industry.
[01:25:23.800 --> 01:25:27.520]   There are people who can make a really good living over doing a high quality handcrafted
[01:25:27.520 --> 01:25:28.760]   product for niches.
[01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:30.000]   There are still wooden toys.
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:31.880]   There are still people who do music.
[01:25:31.880 --> 01:25:34.760]   There's all sorts of career-sourced people, but it's not something that satisfies.
[01:25:34.760 --> 01:25:38.080]   There's not room for a million people probably in that model.
[01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:39.080]   Yeah.
[01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:41.080]   And that I think Clayton is an app developer.
[01:25:41.080 --> 01:25:42.240]   So you can correct me if I'm wrong.
[01:25:42.240 --> 01:25:47.240]   But I think the perception was that when the app store opened and Coco Touch made everything
[01:25:47.240 --> 01:25:51.280]   much more accessible, that you could just write an app and stay home from then on.
[01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:52.360]   A lot of people thought.
[01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:55.440]   And some people did do quite well.
[01:25:55.440 --> 01:25:56.440]   Clayton, is it harder?
[01:25:56.440 --> 01:25:58.520]   I mean, you're an indie app developer in effect.
[01:25:58.520 --> 01:26:00.200]   Is it harder, you think?
[01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:01.320]   Oh, for sure.
[01:26:01.320 --> 01:26:05.600]   I mean, look at Super Bowl ads for--
[01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:06.600]   Apps.
[01:26:06.600 --> 01:26:07.600]   For Clash of Clans.
[01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:08.600]   Yeah.
[01:26:08.600 --> 01:26:09.600]   Yeah.
[01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:10.600]   Clash of Clans.
[01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:14.080]   When you're in that niche, it's going to be much easier.
[01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:20.920]   But I think some of the more expensive, really important-- I mean, like I said, I created
[01:26:20.920 --> 01:26:25.160]   a real estate company that I've been working on over the past few years and hitting a good
[01:26:25.160 --> 01:26:29.000]   point where I'm actually hiring now and going to Alex Lindsey route.
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:33.640]   And I look for apps that are really powerful-- and I'll mention some of them when I pick
[01:26:33.640 --> 01:26:39.440]   some of the week today-- but take a step beyond what iOS can provide.
[01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:42.280]   And for those guys, it's really difficult to survive.
[01:26:42.280 --> 01:26:45.600]   Either maybe they get gobbled up if they go that route.
[01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:49.200]   But there doesn't seem to be a lot of longevity for them.
[01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:52.800]   And I'm always checking to see when the last updates were to see if it's something that
[01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:54.720]   I want to invest in for the future.
[01:26:54.720 --> 01:26:59.560]   Otherwise, I'm having to really just rely on iOS to do the heavy lifting, whether it's
[01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:05.240]   content, contact management or emails or managing PDFs and those sorts of things.
[01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:10.840]   So for those sort of power tools, you want choice.
[01:27:10.840 --> 01:27:12.840]   And iOS is going to be for the mass consumer.
[01:27:12.840 --> 01:27:17.080]   It might not provide the heavy lifting that you can get from some great indie developers.
[01:27:17.080 --> 01:27:18.080]   Yeah.
[01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:19.080]   Yeah.
[01:27:19.080 --> 01:27:20.080]   Yeah.
[01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:23.440]   I think that you really have to think about where that ongoing income is going to come.
[01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:28.520]   It's not-- at a dollar a piece or $3 a piece or $5 a piece, you have to think about what
[01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:31.920]   kind of-- are you going to have in-app purchases or you're going to have subscription services?
[01:27:31.920 --> 01:27:36.280]   Those are all things that I think that at this point, you really have to think through.
[01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:42.320]   I mean, you might be able to make enough to have it be a great year, but it's with a splash.
[01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:45.200]   But if you're going to build a business or you're going to release one app after the
[01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:48.400]   other and really understand how you're going to do that.
[01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:51.160]   But I do think that you just have to be a lot more methodical than you used to be.
[01:27:51.160 --> 01:27:56.240]   I don't think that you can't be successful in this market, but I do think that you can't
[01:27:56.240 --> 01:27:58.400]   just write good code and expect it to work.
[01:27:58.400 --> 01:28:00.040]   I mean, expect it to get rich.
[01:28:00.040 --> 01:28:01.040]   You're going to have to--
[01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:02.040]   Well, I'm marketing.
[01:28:02.040 --> 01:28:03.040]   I mean, going to marketing for a long time.
[01:28:03.040 --> 01:28:04.040]   Exactly.
[01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:05.040]   Well, I see other people--
[01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:06.040]   Well, that's what it looks like.
[01:28:06.040 --> 01:28:07.040]   How are you going to do it?
[01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:08.040]   Let me say that about app developers.
[01:28:08.040 --> 01:28:09.040]   And I think there's also this problem.
[01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:12.920]   And I would actually love to go to a tech conference and give a speech around this exact
[01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:17.040]   issue because I think there's this reluctance among app developers, indie app developers,
[01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:19.360]   to market themselves.
[01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:23.440]   And they think it-- I think what they think about it, they think it negatively about
[01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:25.400]   the marketing aspect.
[01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:30.480]   And frankly, I think they're doing a disservice to their users if they're not marketing to
[01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:33.800]   them, whether it's email newsletters, providing extra tips and tricks.
[01:28:33.800 --> 01:28:36.600]   And I think certain companies do it well, like Reedle.
[01:28:36.600 --> 01:28:40.320]   They do some great jobs providing extra context for an app that you bought.
[01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:42.880]   Maybe you downloaded Spark, great email client.
[01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:46.480]   Well, I love their weekly emails that they send out because you know what?
[01:28:46.480 --> 01:28:48.360]   They're providing-- that's such a rich app.
[01:28:48.360 --> 01:28:50.560]   There's so many different functions in it.
[01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:52.160]   Send me a weekly newsletter.
[01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:53.520]   I invested in your company.
[01:28:53.520 --> 01:28:57.160]   It's not wrong for you to then want to engage with your customers.
[01:28:57.160 --> 01:29:02.120]   But I think a lot of indie app developers don't get sales, don't get marketing.
[01:29:02.120 --> 01:29:03.600]   And they want to blame other things too.
[01:29:03.600 --> 01:29:05.880]   I think there's some mix of that.
[01:29:05.880 --> 01:29:09.040]   And there's a lot of truth in the fact that they just-- they don't like to market to
[01:29:09.040 --> 01:29:10.040]   people.
[01:29:10.040 --> 01:29:11.040]   And that's a huge mistake.
[01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:12.040]   There's a thing too.
[01:29:12.040 --> 01:29:14.680]   Like when the first apps came out, there was-- like people knew how to develop.
[01:29:14.680 --> 01:29:15.680]   They would go and write code.
[01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:17.600]   But then they realized they had to do design too.
[01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:19.360]   And many people hadn't ever thought about design.
[01:29:19.360 --> 01:29:24.240]   But when iOS and then later versions of Android and Pama OS became really well established,
[01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:28.560]   they realized they had to invest heavily in design and design sort of had a renaissance.
[01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:31.400]   And now I think the same thing for the last few years has been true of marketing.
[01:29:31.400 --> 01:29:32.880]   People would say, I've got to code this.
[01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:34.720]   And then maybe I've got to get a designer on this.
[01:29:34.720 --> 01:29:37.840]   And now it's like, well, you know, I was going to get featured by Apple or I'll get
[01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:39.520]   on a few blogs and everything will be great.
[01:29:39.520 --> 01:29:43.080]   But now they really have to realize that I need as good a marketing plan as I have a
[01:29:43.080 --> 01:29:46.040]   development roadmap and a design document.
[01:29:46.040 --> 01:29:48.280]   I need all of those things in alignment.
[01:29:48.280 --> 01:29:50.600]   It's kind of like any gold rush, though.
[01:29:50.600 --> 01:29:52.600]   The first guys, you know, always make the money.
[01:29:52.600 --> 01:29:55.760]   And then everybody looks and says, wow, look at all the money they're making.
[01:29:55.760 --> 01:30:00.960]   And then the place gets swamped with inept prospectors who don't make any money and
[01:30:00.960 --> 01:30:01.960]   lose their shirts.
[01:30:01.960 --> 01:30:06.160]   And then everybody says, oh, look, see, it was a bad idea in the first place.
[01:30:06.160 --> 01:30:09.200]   I have to-- I'll just-- I agree with you all.
[01:30:09.200 --> 01:30:13.120]   But let me point out, it is an amazing thing.
[01:30:13.120 --> 01:30:17.480]   Apple has changed the way software is distributed.
[01:30:17.480 --> 01:30:20.920]   I remember when the Mac first came out, there was a store in San Francisco.
[01:30:20.920 --> 01:30:22.280]   I befriended the owner.
[01:30:22.280 --> 01:30:26.960]   He was proud to have on his shelves every software, every piece of software that was
[01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:28.600]   available for the Macintosh.
[01:30:28.600 --> 01:30:34.520]   And that's how it came in a Ziploc bag in a box, if you were lucky, maybe with a manual.
[01:30:34.520 --> 01:30:38.840]   And it was a lot of work to you how to go to the distributors to get the software out
[01:30:38.840 --> 01:30:39.840]   there.
[01:30:39.840 --> 01:30:42.200]   They had to get your software into stores.
[01:30:42.200 --> 01:30:43.880]   Now it's a lot easier.
[01:30:43.880 --> 01:30:45.840]   There are a lot of great tools for developers.
[01:30:45.840 --> 01:30:49.800]   Apple gives a-- virtually, they give away their tools and they virtually give away a
[01:30:49.800 --> 01:30:53.760]   developer account.
[01:30:53.760 --> 01:30:57.960]   And then when you make an app, you don't have to pay for the bandwidth for downloading
[01:30:57.960 --> 01:30:58.960]   it.
[01:30:58.960 --> 01:31:01.360]   You don't have to worry about creating a transaction platform.
[01:31:01.360 --> 01:31:07.360]   So there's so many benefits to developers that maybe we just have unreasonable expectations
[01:31:07.360 --> 01:31:09.360]   about how much money you're going to make.
[01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:13.640]   Well, and again, I think that it's one of those things that if you're methodical, if
[01:31:13.640 --> 01:31:18.440]   you're planning through that process, I think there's a lot of opportunity to make good
[01:31:18.440 --> 01:31:21.360]   revenue with the App Store.
[01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:25.640]   I think that the issue is that I think that Gary Vanderchuk was actually pretty accurate
[01:31:25.640 --> 01:31:28.880]   on talking about marketing or social marketing is that you've got to put a ring on it.
[01:31:28.880 --> 01:31:30.800]   It is not going to be a blog post.
[01:31:30.800 --> 01:31:32.320]   That's going to get--
[01:31:32.320 --> 01:31:33.320]   How they continue to--
[01:31:33.320 --> 01:31:34.320]   --continue to sales.
[01:31:34.320 --> 01:31:38.400]   It's going to be showing up for-- doing things constantly, doing things-- and either releasing
[01:31:38.400 --> 01:31:42.040]   apps constantly or releasing marketing constantly or releasing training constantly.
[01:31:42.040 --> 01:31:46.400]   But you're going to have to do something that keeps turning that pipe if you're expecting
[01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:47.400]   to build a business around it.
[01:31:47.400 --> 01:31:49.640]   Oh, I said to people don't want a market.
[01:31:49.640 --> 01:31:50.640]   I don't like to market.
[01:31:50.640 --> 01:31:51.640]   I hate it.
[01:31:51.640 --> 01:31:56.560]   The problem is, it's like, OK, what's wrong with-- I made a conscious decision at the
[01:31:56.560 --> 01:32:00.240]   very beginning when I launched my app ReadQuick that I needed to-- you know what?
[01:32:00.240 --> 01:32:04.880]   I needed to make a nice way inside the app for people who if they wanted more information
[01:32:04.880 --> 01:32:09.040]   about to get more out of it, provide your email address.
[01:32:09.040 --> 01:32:10.040]   And you can opt--
[01:32:10.040 --> 01:32:11.040]   That's the wrong with that.
[01:32:11.040 --> 01:32:13.000]   But I'm not going to sell your email.
[01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:16.600]   But what we're going to do is we're going to send you some great tips and tricks on how
[01:32:16.600 --> 01:32:17.600]   to get more out.
[01:32:17.600 --> 01:32:20.480]   Maybe we just partnered with iMore, for instance, which we did.
[01:32:20.480 --> 01:32:23.200]   And so we can read iMore inside of ReadQuick.
[01:32:23.200 --> 01:32:27.520]   That's a nice email to let people users know about that we've partnered with iMore.
[01:32:27.520 --> 01:32:30.480]   Now you can read iMore directly inside the app.
[01:32:30.480 --> 01:32:32.680]   And that's not wrong.
[01:32:32.680 --> 01:32:36.560]   I think that just there's this reluctance on the part of app developers to want to have
[01:32:36.560 --> 01:32:44.520]   that communication with-- and maybe even launching ads, you know, taking advantage of the AdWords
[01:32:44.520 --> 01:32:48.800]   platform in YouTube, doing some really instructive videos in YouTube and marketing--
[01:32:48.800 --> 01:32:51.880]   There's almost an ability of suffering in some of the community where they think that
[01:32:51.880 --> 01:32:54.440]   they should do it and they're noble for not doing it.
[01:32:54.440 --> 01:32:55.440]   Yeah.
[01:32:55.440 --> 01:32:56.440]   Right.
[01:32:56.440 --> 01:32:59.280]   And then they see their app dry up because no one knows about it.
[01:32:59.280 --> 01:33:00.280]   Well, whose fault is that?
[01:33:00.280 --> 01:33:03.600]   It's not Apple's fault.
[01:33:03.600 --> 01:33:07.640]   I mean, discovery has been a source of pain for a lot of developers.
[01:33:07.640 --> 01:33:11.320]   But you also got to do some heavy lifting yourself.
[01:33:11.320 --> 01:33:13.080]   There are legitimate issues.
[01:33:13.080 --> 01:33:16.680]   The lack of demo, the ability to do demo version.
[01:33:16.680 --> 01:33:20.280]   Not every app lends itself to the in-app purchase, right?
[01:33:20.280 --> 01:33:23.520]   Well, you could go to-- you can release it with an in-app purchase that makes it fully
[01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:24.520]   featured.
[01:33:24.520 --> 01:33:27.040]   And so that is the demo to fully feature version.
[01:33:27.040 --> 01:33:28.320]   I'm sure that's Apple's response.
[01:33:28.320 --> 01:33:30.840]   But then a lot of developers say, yeah, that's--
[01:33:30.840 --> 01:33:33.840]   Well, you can't do time-based things, which is what some of them want.
[01:33:33.840 --> 01:33:34.840]   They want you.
[01:33:34.840 --> 01:33:37.880]   There's arguments either way because some believe their app is so valuable that if they--
[01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:41.040]   but so limited in use that if they give you a time trial, you'll use it that one time
[01:33:41.040 --> 01:33:43.160]   you need it and then never actually pay for it.
[01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:45.600]   But others believe that, you know, and there's other issues too.
[01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:48.400]   Like if you give an app your data and then the time runs out and you don't want to buy
[01:33:48.400 --> 01:33:50.680]   it and your data is locked in it, how do you get it out?
[01:33:50.680 --> 01:33:56.240]   So none of this stuff is simple, but that has been nine years and we don't at least
[01:33:56.240 --> 01:33:58.280]   know what they're thinking about it.
[01:33:58.280 --> 01:34:02.480]   That's where I hope Phil Schiller now that he's the unified PUBA or head of App Store
[01:34:02.480 --> 01:34:05.000]   stuff can really lend some clarity and some direction.
[01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:06.480]   I think that's what I think it is.
[01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:10.400]   I think also the people that are making money at this are looking at the landscape and they're
[01:34:10.400 --> 01:34:12.520]   figuring out how to manipulate the landscape.
[01:34:12.520 --> 01:34:14.680]   And you're like, how do I manipulate the market?
[01:34:14.680 --> 01:34:15.680]   This is the way it is.
[01:34:15.680 --> 01:34:16.680]   Now what do we do?
[01:34:16.680 --> 01:34:20.240]   Rather than complaining about where the-- what it should look like, you know, they just take
[01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:21.800]   what they have and they make it work, you know?
[01:34:21.800 --> 01:34:25.280]   And I think that that is-- I mean, that's the difference between an entrepreneur and someone
[01:34:25.280 --> 01:34:27.280]   who's just, you know, a hobbyist.
[01:34:27.280 --> 01:34:28.760]   Right, it might be a ability to pivot.
[01:34:28.760 --> 01:34:32.880]   Renee, you know this story, but back when I was considering the next big version of my
[01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:38.040]   app, it was like, well, you know, we haven't updated in like a year.
[01:34:38.040 --> 01:34:42.880]   We're going to-- we built a totally new app for iOS 9 from the ground up.
[01:34:42.880 --> 01:34:47.640]   Well, and so we decided initially to, you know, basically let people know that we were
[01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:51.000]   sort of deprecating the, you know, the iOS 8 version.
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:54.560]   We were going to charge the same amount for the new version.
[01:34:54.560 --> 01:34:56.760]   Here's the new version, which a lot of companies do.
[01:34:56.760 --> 01:34:59.520]   Right, heck, Omni Group does this.
[01:34:59.520 --> 01:35:01.480]   Fantastic Cal, right?
[01:35:01.480 --> 01:35:03.120]   You're paying for Fantastic Cal 2.
[01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:06.520]   Yes, you can still use Fantastic Cal 1, but we're not going to really be working on it
[01:35:06.520 --> 01:35:07.880]   anymore.
[01:35:07.880 --> 01:35:13.240]   And I just got just-- I got one star reviews and pitchforks and people just didn't understand
[01:35:13.240 --> 01:35:18.000]   that they were buying basically a new app that then we had, you know, so I had to go
[01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:21.680]   back to this idea that we're just going to charge the same amount, forget it, keeping
[01:35:21.680 --> 01:35:23.440]   on the same binary.
[01:35:23.440 --> 01:35:24.440]   It's the same amount.
[01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:25.440]   Here's a brand new update for you.
[01:35:25.440 --> 01:35:29.120]   So basically I had to give it away the app update for free just because of all the negative
[01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:30.120]   reviews.
[01:35:30.120 --> 01:35:33.160]   I had to roll back the idea of doing an in-app purchase for premium features and it was just
[01:35:33.160 --> 01:35:35.880]   pitchforks and it was really tough.
[01:35:35.880 --> 01:35:40.960]   And I just said, you know, it makes you want to like not do it.
[01:35:40.960 --> 01:35:41.960]   It's hard.
[01:35:41.960 --> 01:35:45.160]   And the Tclayton's point previously, even if there is like one-on-one relations with
[01:35:45.160 --> 01:35:47.880]   customers are great, but you have to earn that.
[01:35:47.880 --> 01:35:49.360]   People are now downloading 300 apps.
[01:35:49.360 --> 01:35:52.080]   Sometimes they're downloading 100 games in a week because they're all free to try and
[01:35:52.080 --> 01:35:55.760]   they're bored and they don't want to have 100 emails coming at them from all those apps
[01:35:55.760 --> 01:35:57.520]   because those are pop apps to them.
[01:35:57.520 --> 01:36:01.040]   Those are the disposable ones and you sort of have to fight to be one of those premium
[01:36:01.040 --> 01:36:03.840]   valuable apps that they want to have a relationship with.
[01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:07.880]   And that's not easy anymore either because every like there's a peak outlook is fantastic,
[01:36:07.880 --> 01:36:12.440]   but how many calculator apps can the market really sustain that are at that price point?
[01:36:12.440 --> 01:36:13.520]   How many quick reading apps?
[01:36:13.520 --> 01:36:15.400]   How many Twitter, Twitter clients?
[01:36:15.400 --> 01:36:21.840]   How many podcast apps that, you know, still has to shake itself out.
[01:36:21.840 --> 01:36:23.440]   I think it will continue to do so.
[01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:26.560]   But I do think that it is something that you really do have to look at that.
[01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:30.040]   I mean, we're developing some apps right now.
[01:36:30.040 --> 01:36:33.880]   And you know, this is a conversation that's happening almost every day of exactly what
[01:36:33.880 --> 01:36:34.880]   is the longevity.
[01:36:34.880 --> 01:36:36.160]   Do we decide we're going to put something out?
[01:36:36.160 --> 01:36:39.280]   There's a couple of apps that we're going to release probably next year that are later
[01:36:39.280 --> 01:36:43.840]   this year that, you know, I'm putting out because I need them.
[01:36:43.840 --> 01:36:47.920]   Like, if I make some money on it, it's great, but I need them internally for the company.
[01:36:47.920 --> 01:36:52.160]   And so I'm just making them for the company and hoping to pay off some of the development
[01:36:52.160 --> 01:36:53.160]   costs.
[01:36:53.160 --> 01:36:57.280]   And so, but there's other ones that we're looking at that we're trying to figure out
[01:36:57.280 --> 01:37:01.920]   exactly how do we have something ongoing that has an ongoing value, ongoing revenue, that
[01:37:01.920 --> 01:37:03.920]   makes it worth developing.
[01:37:03.920 --> 01:37:06.840]   I mean, I think that for the apps that I use all the time, I want them to keep on making
[01:37:06.840 --> 01:37:07.840]   money.
[01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:10.000]   I don't buy a lot of, I don't download a lot of free apps.
[01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:13.760]   And the reason I don't download the free apps is because I don't know how that developer
[01:37:13.760 --> 01:37:15.400]   is going to generate revenue.
[01:37:15.400 --> 01:37:18.440]   And then I'm afraid of getting committed to it because then it's not going to work.
[01:37:18.440 --> 01:37:19.720]   They're not going to update it.
[01:37:19.720 --> 01:37:25.960]   And so, I'm happy to pay more, pay subscriptions or pay updates to make sure that the apps
[01:37:25.960 --> 01:37:28.280]   that I care about are still there.
[01:37:28.280 --> 01:37:30.280]   I don't have a problem, unfortunately.
[01:37:30.280 --> 01:37:33.200]   Don't worry, Clayton, none of the pitchforks came from me.
[01:37:33.200 --> 01:37:36.800]   Hey, let me ask you, and then you don't have to say anything, but has read quick and
[01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:37.800]   a success?
[01:37:37.800 --> 01:37:40.720]   Was it, I mean, you've put a lot of effort into it, a lot of money into it.
[01:37:40.720 --> 01:37:41.960]   It's a beautiful website.
[01:37:41.960 --> 01:37:43.960]   It's a beautiful app.
[01:37:43.960 --> 01:37:47.920]   If you had to do it all again, would you, Clayton?
[01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:50.600]   You know, it was a great learning experience, to be honest.
[01:37:50.600 --> 01:37:52.640]   Okay, there you go.
[01:37:52.640 --> 01:37:54.200]   That's your answer there, folks.
[01:37:54.200 --> 01:38:00.160]   No, I mean, as a money maker, I mean, the amount I've spent on development, design,
[01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:05.160]   and I mean, you know, no, I don't think, I think if anything, maybe I make a little
[01:38:05.160 --> 01:38:09.360]   bit, it's, you know, and I've got the LLC, so it's a nice business expense.
[01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:13.680]   But you've learned, I mean, if you broke even, I think that that would be a good case for
[01:38:13.680 --> 01:38:17.240]   doing it because you learned a lot, right?
[01:38:17.240 --> 01:38:18.240]   I learned a lot.
[01:38:18.240 --> 01:38:22.880]   I pretty much, yeah, break even is probably, I probably made more than I broke even.
[01:38:22.880 --> 01:38:26.200]   And it still continues to generate, you know, every month, and I get new users every month,
[01:38:26.200 --> 01:38:28.560]   which is great.
[01:38:28.560 --> 01:38:35.560]   But yeah, to go back and do it again, given my focus now, I don't, I just don't see myself
[01:38:35.560 --> 01:38:36.560]   doing it.
[01:38:36.560 --> 01:38:37.560]   Let's give you a big point.
[01:38:37.560 --> 01:38:42.120]   Alex Sagan, why built it like Alex, you know, internally, so it was something I wanted for
[01:38:42.120 --> 01:38:45.760]   it to read a lot of content quickly for the news, you know, how to be up early to do a
[01:38:45.760 --> 01:38:46.760]   morning show.
[01:38:46.760 --> 01:38:47.760]   That was the whole point of it.
[01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:48.760]   Right.
[01:38:48.760 --> 01:38:54.760]   Readquickapp.com, of course, it's on the app store, but sometimes it's easier just to
[01:38:54.760 --> 01:38:59.080]   go to a website and click the download button and get the app store launched.
[01:38:59.080 --> 01:39:00.080]   Readquickapp.com.
[01:39:00.080 --> 01:39:06.080]   There's a good video on the website that'll explain how it works and why it's.
[01:39:06.080 --> 01:39:08.880]   You give an app that teaches you how to speed read.
[01:39:08.880 --> 01:39:10.640]   That's the, I recognize that voice.
[01:39:10.640 --> 01:39:11.640]   That's a good voice.
[01:39:11.640 --> 01:39:12.640]   It's a good voice.
[01:39:12.640 --> 01:39:14.640]   It's an article that you would like to read.
[01:39:14.640 --> 01:39:19.000]   Then readquick displays the article one word at a time at the pace of your choice.
[01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:22.320]   It's kind of amazing that you can actually understand something that's one word at a
[01:39:22.320 --> 01:39:23.920]   time, but it does work.
[01:39:23.920 --> 01:39:24.920]   You do say it.
[01:39:24.920 --> 01:39:28.000]   Well, here's the great thing about hearing from your community, right, by capturing email
[01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:31.120]   addresses, being able to have a discussion and dialogue with your users and learning.
[01:39:31.120 --> 01:39:33.920]   Like I never knew that this would help dyslexics.
[01:39:33.920 --> 01:39:36.480]   Who have dyslexia or live with dyslexia.
[01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:40.720]   By narrowing the focus so that you don't have other words jangling around.
[01:39:40.720 --> 01:39:43.840]   Yeah, to hear from them saying for the first time in their life, they've been able to
[01:39:43.840 --> 01:39:45.480]   actually read the news.
[01:39:45.480 --> 01:39:46.480]   Wow.
[01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:49.040]   We added open dyslexic font just for them.
[01:39:49.040 --> 01:39:51.160]   There's things you just learn as you go.
[01:39:51.160 --> 01:39:52.160]   That's awesome.
[01:39:52.160 --> 01:39:53.160]   Yeah.
[01:39:53.160 --> 01:39:55.080]   Congratulations on your success.
[01:39:55.080 --> 01:39:57.760]   Yeah, I think breaking even is a good way to look at it.
[01:39:57.760 --> 01:39:58.760]   Yeah.
[01:39:58.760 --> 01:40:00.480]   Well, you got to include the cost of your time too.
[01:40:00.480 --> 01:40:02.680]   I mean, I'm sure you put a lot of time into that.
[01:40:02.680 --> 01:40:04.280]   We're going to take a break when we come back.
[01:40:04.280 --> 01:40:10.360]   Pics of the week with Renee Richie from iMore.com Alex Lindsey from the Pixel Core at Alex
[01:40:10.360 --> 01:40:13.280]   Lindsay on the Twitter.
[01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:16.560]   And of course, Clayton Morris from Fox and Friends and Clayton Morris dot com.
[01:40:16.560 --> 01:40:20.840]   Acclate Morris and the brand new podcast.
[01:40:20.840 --> 01:40:22.000]   Get rich quick.
[01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:25.000]   No, no, the opposite.
[01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:26.000]   Rich quick.
[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:27.000]   It's like the app.
[01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.080]   Hey, that's a yeah.
[01:40:29.080 --> 01:40:31.640]   Oh, rich quick.
[01:40:31.640 --> 01:40:36.040]   You know, I didn't believe I could get rich quick.
[01:40:36.040 --> 01:40:37.040]   Rich quick.
[01:40:37.040 --> 01:40:38.040]   One.
[01:40:38.040 --> 01:40:39.040]   Another one.
[01:40:39.040 --> 01:40:40.040]   The app store.
[01:40:40.040 --> 01:40:41.040]   I love it.
[01:40:41.040 --> 01:40:44.120]   We'll have more in just a moment.
[01:40:44.120 --> 01:40:47.760]   Our show today brought to you by FreshBooks.
[01:40:47.760 --> 01:40:53.040]   You know, we always try to use in fact in every case today, do ads for things that I
[01:40:53.040 --> 01:40:55.960]   use and have found great value in.
[01:40:55.960 --> 01:40:59.760]   It makes it a, you know, a recommendation instead of just an advertisement, something
[01:40:59.760 --> 01:41:02.040]   I have, you know, had a great experience with.
[01:41:02.040 --> 01:41:05.360]   And this has been the case for all three of our advertisers this week at FreshBooks.
[01:41:05.360 --> 01:41:06.360]   Absolutely.
[01:41:06.360 --> 01:41:10.760]   Discovered FreshBooks when I was working in Toronto with Amber MacArthur doing call for
[01:41:10.760 --> 01:41:11.880]   help the TV show up there.
[01:41:11.880 --> 01:41:13.320]   And I had to bill them.
[01:41:13.320 --> 01:41:14.400]   I had to bill them for my time.
[01:41:14.400 --> 01:41:17.360]   I had to bill them for expenses.
[01:41:17.360 --> 01:41:19.240]   And I had to bill them in Canadian dollars.
[01:41:19.240 --> 01:41:24.800]   And it was just the biggest P I T A. I would fire up word Nick sell get either all their
[01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:28.860]   receipts together, sentiment and voice or more often than not at the end of the month
[01:41:28.860 --> 01:41:32.160]   to come and I go, do that next month.
[01:41:32.160 --> 01:41:36.640]   And that next month, and by the time you got four invoices backed up, couple of things.
[01:41:36.640 --> 01:41:39.720]   First of all, that's four months you didn't get paid.
[01:41:39.720 --> 01:41:44.960]   And it's really a difficult thing to send an invoice, four invoices at one time to a company.
[01:41:44.960 --> 01:41:47.160]   They don't like it.
[01:41:47.160 --> 01:41:51.060]   That's when I was complaining about this and, and Toronto and Amber said, you ought to really
[01:41:51.060 --> 01:41:54.840]   try my friends of company FreshBooks.
[01:41:54.840 --> 01:41:59.740]   And this was such a revelation, I started using it and I started getting paid faster.
[01:41:59.740 --> 01:42:03.460]   I started sending out my invoices every single month because it's so easy.
[01:42:03.460 --> 01:42:06.420]   You create a beautiful professional looking invoice.
[01:42:06.420 --> 01:42:08.620]   You send it to them via email.
[01:42:08.620 --> 01:42:11.980]   There's a button that says, pay this invoice right on there.
[01:42:11.980 --> 01:42:16.220]   Your client can use a lot of different online payment services, all of them really to pay
[01:42:16.220 --> 01:42:18.500]   you, which makes it easy for them.
[01:42:18.500 --> 01:42:23.860]   And turns out the clients are just as, you know, peeved by having to pay bills as, as
[01:42:23.860 --> 01:42:25.320]   you are by having to send bills.
[01:42:25.320 --> 01:42:29.560]   It's just, it's just some, it's something that's you got to do, but it's not part of
[01:42:29.560 --> 01:42:32.160]   why you're in business.
[01:42:32.160 --> 01:42:36.280]   So make it easy for them and they pay you faster.
[01:42:36.280 --> 01:42:39.040]   And as for expenses, you can use the FreshBooks app.
[01:42:39.040 --> 01:42:42.720]   Just take pictures of the receipts and just put them right into the invoice.
[01:42:42.720 --> 01:42:45.400]   If you build for time and hour, same thing.
[01:42:45.400 --> 01:42:48.400]   And you can even set up FreshBooks to import expenses directly from your bank account,
[01:42:48.400 --> 01:42:50.200]   which is really, really cool.
[01:42:50.200 --> 01:42:53.480]   So when you use your debit card for that meal, the tank of gas, when you buy a new
[01:42:53.480 --> 01:42:57.220]   computer, boom, the purchase recorded instantly in FreshBooks.
[01:42:57.220 --> 01:42:58.420]   I love the new iPhone app.
[01:42:58.420 --> 01:42:59.420]   You're going to take a look at it.
[01:42:59.420 --> 01:43:01.340]   You can conduct business anywhere.
[01:43:01.340 --> 01:43:05.780]   It's great for people who like come to your house, like if you're a, I don't know, you
[01:43:05.780 --> 01:43:10.780]   do a home theater install or you do, or you're a plumber or you're a handyman.
[01:43:10.780 --> 01:43:14.620]   You can, you can present the estimate right there on your phone.
[01:43:14.620 --> 01:43:16.100]   You can get their acceptance there.
[01:43:16.100 --> 01:43:20.900]   You can send them, you can show them the invoice and they can even pay with the FreshBooks,
[01:43:20.900 --> 01:43:22.740]   a chip and pin card reader.
[01:43:22.740 --> 01:43:24.600]   It's just so incredible.
[01:43:24.600 --> 01:43:26.280]   And I know tax season is coming up.
[01:43:26.280 --> 01:43:29.200]   It's probably too late for this year, but for next year, you'll really be glad you're
[01:43:29.200 --> 01:43:30.700]   using FreshBooks.
[01:43:30.700 --> 01:43:33.080]   It makes the whole process so much easier.
[01:43:33.080 --> 01:43:37.360]   Your accountant will love you or if you do your own taxes and I think a lot of freelancers,
[01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:38.840]   that's what we do.
[01:43:38.840 --> 01:43:39.840]   You'll love you.
[01:43:39.840 --> 01:43:46.400]   You'll say, thank you year ago, me, for going to freshbooks.com/macbreak and signing up for

[01:43:52.080 --> 01:43:54.960]   did you hear about this section?"
[01:43:54.960 --> 01:43:58.860]   FreshBooks.com/macbreak.

[01:44:03.040 --> 01:44:04.600]   Thank you FreshBooks.
[01:44:04.600 --> 01:44:06.120]   I know that's what I thought.
[01:44:06.120 --> 01:44:07.280]   FreshBooks.com/macbreak.
[01:44:07.280 --> 01:44:13.860]   This is the point of the show where we like to do picks of the week.
[01:44:13.860 --> 01:44:14.860]   Let me start.
[01:44:14.860 --> 01:44:16.360]   Oh, right.
[01:44:16.360 --> 01:44:21.680]   Let's start with Alex in the high end.
[01:44:21.680 --> 01:44:24.840]   I'm not going to disappoint you.
[01:44:24.840 --> 01:44:29.320]   My pick for the week is in the professional video realm.
[01:44:29.320 --> 01:44:31.920]   There's a company that we've done a lot of work with.
[01:44:31.920 --> 01:44:35.840]   We own a lot of hardware is Sound Devices.
[01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:40.560]   I think some of you guys know we have the USB-Pre and 788s and a bunch of Sound Recorders.
[01:44:40.560 --> 01:44:41.560]   They also do video recorders.
[01:44:41.560 --> 01:44:44.320]   They do a PIX 240, which I think you guys have a couple of.
[01:44:44.320 --> 01:44:45.920]   Yes, that's what we use.
[01:44:45.920 --> 01:44:46.920]   Love them.
[01:44:46.920 --> 01:44:49.480]   You should PIX 60s that you can put in.
[01:44:49.480 --> 01:44:55.400]   They have a little version of that that I just got a few of and pretty excited about.
[01:44:55.400 --> 01:44:57.520]   This is a E5.
[01:44:57.520 --> 01:44:59.440]   This is a PIXi E5.
[01:44:59.440 --> 01:45:03.080]   This basically does a lot of what a 240.
[01:45:03.080 --> 01:45:06.960]   Not all of what a PIX 240 does, but a lot of what a PIX 240 does.
[01:45:06.960 --> 01:45:09.320]   Really, it acts more like a monitor.
[01:45:09.320 --> 01:45:12.200]   You can hook this to the top of your DSLR.
[01:45:12.200 --> 01:45:14.480]   You can also attach it to stuff.
[01:45:14.480 --> 01:45:21.120]   The memory on this guy is this little memory card in the back and it's USB.
[01:45:21.120 --> 01:45:24.480]   If you want to pull it out here, I think I can pull it out.
[01:45:24.480 --> 01:45:26.120]   Really easily.
[01:45:26.120 --> 01:45:30.000]   It's a USB card, a USB 3.
[01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:37.200]   You can also sell them with shells and I think they use the M-SSD or M memory chips
[01:45:37.200 --> 01:45:38.800]   that you can use in here.
[01:45:38.800 --> 01:45:39.800]   You can put batteries in them.
[01:45:39.800 --> 01:45:41.880]   I don't have a battery in this one right now.
[01:45:41.880 --> 01:45:42.880]   It does 4K.
[01:45:42.880 --> 01:45:44.360]   It's a super bright screen.
[01:45:44.360 --> 01:45:48.960]   I just unplugged it so it's not very bright right now, but it normally is.
[01:45:48.960 --> 01:45:55.480]   It's just a great little ... I've been putting off ... I have a lot of PIXs and I was putting
[01:45:55.480 --> 01:45:57.400]   off buying anymore.
[01:45:57.400 --> 01:45:59.840]   We're looking at using these for a bunch of records.
[01:45:59.840 --> 01:46:03.080]   It's just a really, really great recorder.
[01:46:03.080 --> 01:46:05.280]   I think it's about $1,300.
[01:46:05.280 --> 01:46:06.840]   You have scopes.
[01:46:06.840 --> 01:46:11.240]   If you're doing green screen work, you're doing a lot of other things, you can review
[01:46:11.240 --> 01:46:12.240]   things.
[01:46:12.240 --> 01:46:13.880]   You can get all the scopes that you want.
[01:46:13.880 --> 01:46:18.640]   There's just a lot you can do with it and you can just attach it to your camera and have
[01:46:18.640 --> 01:46:22.240]   it record your ISOs for you and everything else.
[01:46:22.240 --> 01:46:27.120]   Anyway, if you're looking for something like this and you're looking for the rock solid,
[01:46:27.120 --> 01:46:32.360]   always is going to work kind of thing that works really well and has lots of features.
[01:46:32.360 --> 01:46:35.840]   This is the one that I would ... You could probably use that on the ... A lot of people
[01:46:35.840 --> 01:46:41.000]   using the Sony A7 for video recording and on at least the older one, you had to have
[01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.680]   an external recorder to do 4K44.
[01:46:43.680 --> 01:46:48.040]   Well, and even if ... The thing to remember is that what's coming out of your camera,
[01:46:48.040 --> 01:46:51.400]   even if you can record internally, what's coming out of the camera is a much higher
[01:46:51.400 --> 01:46:55.440]   quality than the H.264 or whatever the recording internally.
[01:46:55.440 --> 01:47:00.840]   We barely ever record internally to any camera because they're all too compressed unless
[01:47:00.840 --> 01:47:05.720]   it's ... There's a couple cameras that are red or black magic that will record raw or
[01:47:05.720 --> 01:47:12.320]   airy Alexa, but one of the big reasons we use these recorders is so that we can get that
[01:47:12.320 --> 01:47:20.440]   high resolution as high as we want, whether it's Apple ProRes HQ or even higher 4.4.
[01:47:20.440 --> 01:47:23.880]   We can capture all of that on these little devices.
[01:47:23.880 --> 01:47:31.240]   If you remember, Leo, when we did Mac Break long ago with the huge server raids and the
[01:47:31.240 --> 01:47:33.760]   giant cameras and all of those ...
[01:47:33.760 --> 01:47:37.000]   And you can only record like 12 minutes, right?
[01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:38.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:41.280]   We had to dump it all on and start over again.
[01:47:41.280 --> 01:47:43.560]   Well, all of those raids ...
[01:47:43.560 --> 01:47:44.560]   It's amazing, isn't it?
[01:47:44.560 --> 01:47:46.360]   ... has been reduced to this for two hours.
[01:47:46.360 --> 01:47:47.360]   I love technology.
[01:47:47.360 --> 01:47:48.360]   Two hours.
[01:47:48.360 --> 01:47:49.360]   Wow.
[01:47:49.360 --> 01:47:51.880]   Two hours of really high resolution footage.
[01:47:51.880 --> 01:47:52.880]   So amazing.
[01:47:52.880 --> 01:47:55.920]   What a revolutionary time we live in.
[01:47:55.920 --> 01:47:56.920]   Forget Hamilton.
[01:47:56.920 --> 01:47:57.920]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:47:57.920 --> 01:47:58.920]   I got Lindsey.
[01:47:58.920 --> 01:48:01.920]   I mean, every time I see this, I was going, "You don't understand.
[01:48:01.920 --> 01:48:07.520]   Back with the day when we got to go backwards through the snow with a raid in our hands."
[01:48:07.520 --> 01:48:08.960]   He was from Pixico.
[01:48:08.960 --> 01:48:10.240]   He had a Pix.
[01:48:10.240 --> 01:48:12.720]   He liked to record on the USB.
[01:48:12.720 --> 01:48:13.720]   I got it.
[01:48:13.720 --> 01:48:14.720]   We'll write a rap for you.
[01:48:14.720 --> 01:48:15.720]   Yeah, I got that.
[01:48:15.720 --> 01:48:16.720]   What's his name?
[01:48:16.720 --> 01:48:17.720]   Alexander Lindsey.
[01:48:17.720 --> 01:48:18.720]   Exactly.
[01:48:18.720 --> 01:48:22.560]   So anyway, that's Pix E5.
[01:48:22.560 --> 01:48:23.560]   Pix E5.
[01:48:23.560 --> 01:48:24.560]   A, $1,300.
[01:48:24.560 --> 01:48:25.560]   Nothing.
[01:48:25.560 --> 01:48:26.560]   Just two Alexes.
[01:48:26.560 --> 01:48:27.560]   Early two Alexes.
[01:48:27.560 --> 01:48:28.560]   Yeah.
[01:48:28.560 --> 01:48:29.560]   Nothing.
[01:48:29.560 --> 01:48:30.560]   Exactly.
[01:48:30.560 --> 01:48:31.560]   It's cheap.
[01:48:31.560 --> 01:48:34.640]   I'm going to start with you, Clayton Morris, because you're our guest today.
[01:48:34.640 --> 01:48:35.640]   Oh, thank you.
[01:48:35.640 --> 01:48:37.160]   What do you got for us?
[01:48:37.160 --> 01:48:42.600]   Well, as I was mentioning over the past year, been building a business.
[01:48:42.600 --> 01:48:46.240]   And it's like a real estate investment business, right?
[01:48:46.240 --> 01:48:47.240]   Exactly.
[01:48:47.240 --> 01:48:48.240]   You're not selling houses.
[01:48:48.240 --> 01:48:51.040]   You're not like, you didn't get your license and you go out and you sell houses on like
[01:48:51.040 --> 01:48:52.840]   Tinky Wink for a little extra income.
[01:48:52.840 --> 01:48:53.840]   No, no, no.
[01:48:53.840 --> 01:49:00.200]   I mean, my wife has her license, but we basically help busy people get turnkey real estate.
[01:49:00.200 --> 01:49:03.040]   And yeah, so, you know, I should do that.
[01:49:03.040 --> 01:49:07.760]   I should own a few homes around town to rent them out, especially in the Airbnb era.
[01:49:07.760 --> 01:49:10.520]   Has this changed the economics of it?
[01:49:10.520 --> 01:49:12.960]   I mean, I buy my properties in the Midwest.
[01:49:12.960 --> 01:49:15.560]   So that's where I have the bulk of my property.
[01:49:15.560 --> 01:49:17.280]   And nobody wants to go there.
[01:49:17.280 --> 01:49:19.200]   So you can't really Airbnb them.
[01:49:19.200 --> 01:49:21.800]   Well, I go where I'm sorry, I apologize.
[01:49:21.800 --> 01:49:25.200]   So like, you know, it's $35,000 house.
[01:49:25.200 --> 01:49:26.200]   Wow.
[01:49:26.200 --> 01:49:27.640]   Three bedroom, one bath.
[01:49:27.640 --> 01:49:29.680]   It rents out for $700, $800 a month.
[01:49:29.680 --> 01:49:31.400]   So that's I work with doctors across the country.
[01:49:31.400 --> 01:49:34.920]   I have a lot of clients actually from from California and other parts of the world.
[01:49:34.920 --> 01:49:36.240]   Is it better than like doing a REIT?
[01:49:36.240 --> 01:49:37.920]   I mean, it's a direct investment.
[01:49:37.920 --> 01:49:38.920]   Oh, absolutely.
[01:49:38.920 --> 01:49:39.920]   Yeah.
[01:49:39.920 --> 01:49:40.920]   Yeah.
[01:49:40.920 --> 01:49:42.560]   That's the thing because you'll get these bankers who will tell you, oh, no, no, no,
[01:49:42.560 --> 01:49:43.560]   don't keep your money with us.
[01:49:43.560 --> 01:49:44.560]   We'll just put it in a REIT.
[01:49:44.560 --> 01:49:46.040]   We'll give you 2% return.
[01:49:46.040 --> 01:49:50.560]   I'd rather get a 12, 15% return year over year.
[01:49:50.560 --> 01:49:51.560]   But anyway, that's what I do.
[01:49:51.560 --> 01:49:57.320]   So I buy houses, rehab them and it's been amazing and it's growing at a great clip.
[01:49:57.320 --> 01:49:58.320]   Good for you.
[01:49:58.320 --> 01:50:01.880]   Like I run my whole business on my Mac, right?
[01:50:01.880 --> 01:50:05.920]   And there are some limitations, obviously, with the system level apps.
[01:50:05.920 --> 01:50:10.280]   You know, the El Capi 10 apps that a lot of them work great.
[01:50:10.280 --> 01:50:11.760]   But for instance, I use busy contacts.
[01:50:11.760 --> 01:50:14.000]   I was looking for a better way to manage contacts.
[01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:17.160]   And so yeah, it's been really fantastic.
[01:50:17.160 --> 01:50:20.920]   So busy contacts in the new version is really great.
[01:50:20.920 --> 01:50:25.600]   So you know, it works great when you're using busy contacts with if you've got one iCloud
[01:50:25.600 --> 01:50:30.600]   to contact iCloud content.
[01:50:30.600 --> 01:50:33.560]   So I want to contact list address book.
[01:50:33.560 --> 01:50:34.760]   Yes, it's address book.
[01:50:34.760 --> 01:50:35.760]   It's at a multiples.
[01:50:35.760 --> 01:50:37.440]   But what's great is you can do tags in this.
[01:50:37.440 --> 01:50:41.960]   So and you know, I have lots of conversations with our investors and buyers at different
[01:50:41.960 --> 01:50:43.120]   stages of closing.
[01:50:43.120 --> 01:50:47.240]   So you know, John's property may be closing there Friday and we're in the middle of rehabbing
[01:50:47.240 --> 01:50:48.320]   123 Main Street.
[01:50:48.320 --> 01:50:53.560]   I need to know like different stages of communication with clients, right?
[01:50:53.560 --> 01:50:56.560]   And so just bringing in and hiring an acquisitions manager.
[01:50:56.560 --> 01:51:02.040]   Now she'll be able to look at the different stages of conversation through, you know,
[01:51:02.040 --> 01:51:06.440]   upcoming events that ties in with your calendar, you know, messages that have been pulled up.
[01:51:06.440 --> 01:51:09.800]   So this is what I like is it shows you all the contacts you've had with them.
[01:51:09.800 --> 01:51:12.600]   It's kind of like a CRM style thing.
[01:51:12.600 --> 01:51:17.880]   So you can see all the activity that you've had with this guy on at a glance on the contact
[01:51:17.880 --> 01:51:18.880]   sheet.
[01:51:18.880 --> 01:51:19.880]   Right.
[01:51:19.880 --> 01:51:22.120]   So I've worked, you know, talked to hundreds of investors, right?
[01:51:22.120 --> 01:51:25.960]   I talked, you know, in Australia and California, I need to know it's great to be able to say,
[01:51:25.960 --> 01:51:31.200]   Hey, John, you know, I know last week we were talking about this property or, you know,
[01:51:31.200 --> 01:51:34.640]   you were trying to move money out of your 401k or into a self directed IRA, all these
[01:51:34.640 --> 01:51:35.640]   different things.
[01:51:35.640 --> 01:51:40.040]   So it is like sort of immediate, like name tag on the chest, you know, and you get to
[01:51:40.040 --> 01:51:44.520]   like have almost like memory recall right in front of you when you're having to look
[01:51:44.520 --> 01:51:51.400]   up, so tags in with mail, and of course you can add tags to anything to which is great.
[01:51:51.400 --> 01:51:57.360]   And what you can't do in the iOS address book, or I'm sorry with El Capitan's address
[01:51:57.360 --> 01:51:58.360]   book.
[01:51:58.360 --> 01:51:59.560]   You can't, you can't do tags.
[01:51:59.560 --> 01:52:04.920]   And this sticks with not just your iCloud contacts, but also with Google Facebook and
[01:52:04.920 --> 01:52:06.680]   LinkedIn, which is really nice.
[01:52:06.680 --> 01:52:08.160]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:52:08.160 --> 01:52:12.200]   You got everybody you've ever talked to and it's all, it's all mushed together.
[01:52:12.200 --> 01:52:13.200]   It is pricey.
[01:52:13.200 --> 01:52:14.200]   It's 50 bucks.
[01:52:14.200 --> 01:52:18.520]   It acts ACT, which people used for years in sales and stuff.
[01:52:18.520 --> 01:52:21.240]   This does a lot of the things that act did.
[01:52:21.240 --> 01:52:22.240]   Right.
[01:52:22.240 --> 01:52:26.840]   So then taking that to the next step with iOS, I use interact by the folks over at Agile
[01:52:26.840 --> 01:52:28.960]   Tortoise, who of course make drafts.
[01:52:28.960 --> 01:52:30.840]   So I needed a little extra oomph there.
[01:52:30.840 --> 01:52:34.960]   So on the iOS side, interact for managing contacts is great.
[01:52:34.960 --> 01:52:38.640]   So I sort of stepped it up a level in my contacts management.
[01:52:38.640 --> 01:52:42.680]   Why is somebody's asking why you don't use something more industrial strength like sales
[01:52:42.680 --> 01:52:43.680]   force?
[01:52:43.680 --> 01:52:45.120]   I'm not there yet.
[01:52:45.120 --> 01:52:52.200]   And you know, you don't want to focus on revenue first, right?
[01:52:52.200 --> 01:52:53.200]   Focus on the things that matter.
[01:52:53.200 --> 01:52:55.560]   Don't spend all your revenue before you make it.
[01:52:55.560 --> 01:52:58.440]   Well, yeah, I could go infusion soft, right?
[01:52:58.440 --> 01:53:02.280]   I could go, I could spend thousands and thousands and thousands on these next level tools.
[01:53:02.280 --> 01:53:05.800]   I think people have a tendency to want to get so caught up in making business cards before
[01:53:05.800 --> 01:53:06.800]   they make a business.
[01:53:06.800 --> 01:53:11.960]   You know, and I think that's maybe down the line when I have a proper, the proper infrastructure
[01:53:11.960 --> 01:53:12.960]   for that.
[01:53:12.960 --> 01:53:15.640]   But right now it's, you know, a little old me and a few people in the house.
[01:53:15.640 --> 01:53:17.740]   So there.
[01:53:17.740 --> 01:53:20.080]   There's a couple of really good tips.
[01:53:20.080 --> 01:53:24.080]   We don't talk enough about kind of useful tools for this kind of thing.
[01:53:24.080 --> 01:53:25.080]   I think that's great.
[01:53:25.080 --> 01:53:26.240]   Thank you for doing that.
[01:53:26.240 --> 01:53:27.240]   Sure.
[01:53:27.240 --> 01:53:30.000]   Yeah, really appreciate it.
[01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:31.000]   And I use busy contacts too.
[01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:32.520]   And I don't have any reason to use it.
[01:53:32.520 --> 01:53:33.520]   I just like it.
[01:53:33.520 --> 01:53:36.440]   Well, it's got so many extra bells and whistles.
[01:53:36.440 --> 01:53:38.120]   Yeah, I don't do sales or anything.
[01:53:38.120 --> 01:53:39.320]   So I don't really, I don't care.
[01:53:39.320 --> 01:53:42.480]   I don't, when I talk to somebody, I don't care if I've had contact with them before or
[01:53:42.480 --> 01:53:43.760]   whatever, but it's just handy.
[01:53:43.760 --> 01:53:46.120]   It's a good, it's a better address book, frankly.
[01:53:46.120 --> 01:53:47.120]   Right.
[01:53:47.120 --> 01:53:50.760]   And I do love it that it ties into all the other address books I have that makes it really
[01:53:50.760 --> 01:53:51.760]   useful.
[01:53:51.760 --> 01:53:53.520]   Very good.
[01:53:53.520 --> 01:53:55.520]   Thank you, Clayton.
[01:53:55.520 --> 01:53:57.360]   Renee or Renee.
[01:53:57.360 --> 01:53:58.360]   Masele.
[01:53:58.360 --> 01:54:03.560]   So first of all, I got my stand with Apple shirt that's arrived.
[01:54:03.560 --> 01:54:04.560]   Oh, nice.
[01:54:04.560 --> 01:54:05.880]   Is it too late to get those?
[01:54:05.880 --> 01:54:07.960]   Yeah, we're going to do something else soon.
[01:54:07.960 --> 01:54:09.840]   So I think that I'll let everyone know when that goes live.
[01:54:09.840 --> 01:54:11.000]   But that was the first one.
[01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:14.280]   I think hundreds of people got them, so I'm super happy about it.
[01:54:14.280 --> 01:54:15.760]   I have two quick picks.
[01:54:15.760 --> 01:54:16.760]   One is Blockhead.
[01:54:16.760 --> 01:54:20.160]   It's from our friends at 10/1 Design who do all sorts of really amazing stuff.
[01:54:20.160 --> 01:54:25.880]   And all this is, is a little attachment that you take off the existing plug on your Apple
[01:54:25.880 --> 01:54:30.680]   power adapter, whether I think it works on both the iPad one and the MacBook one.
[01:54:30.680 --> 01:54:34.080]   And then you slide this in and it lets you mount a flush into an outlet.
[01:54:34.080 --> 01:54:36.200]   And I can't believe no one ever thought about this before.
[01:54:36.200 --> 01:54:37.200]   Yeah.
[01:54:37.200 --> 01:54:38.200]   I've heard of.
[01:54:38.200 --> 01:54:43.840]   I actually had an adapter that did that that you had to buy a special adapter and it broke
[01:54:43.840 --> 01:54:44.840]   right away.
[01:54:44.840 --> 01:54:45.840]   So this is better.
[01:54:45.840 --> 01:54:49.960]   This is one of those things that Johnny I was just when he saw this the other day.
[01:54:49.960 --> 01:54:51.960]   Oh, yes.
[01:54:51.960 --> 01:54:52.960]   It's inevitable.
[01:54:52.960 --> 01:54:55.440]   I can't believe it is inevitable.
[01:54:55.440 --> 01:54:58.240]   Or he said, why are they screwing with my my my adapter?
[01:54:58.240 --> 01:54:59.240]   One of the other.
[01:54:59.240 --> 01:55:00.440]   Yeah, go either way.
[01:55:00.440 --> 01:55:03.320]   It's such a great idea because now they're not projecting out of the wall all the time.
[01:55:03.320 --> 01:55:05.480]   So I thought this is terrific.
[01:55:05.480 --> 01:55:09.240]   I'm getting a couple of these and I'm going to try them out, but just love it for a site.
[01:55:09.240 --> 01:55:11.240]   Really, really smart ideas.
[01:55:11.240 --> 01:55:14.640]   The other thing I wanted to mention is overcast talking about apps and different models for
[01:55:14.640 --> 01:55:15.640]   them.
[01:55:15.640 --> 01:55:19.800]   So overcast it went to a patronage model a little while ago, several months ago was controversial
[01:55:19.800 --> 01:55:22.560]   at the time, but Mark, I might just pushed out a big update to it.
[01:55:22.560 --> 01:55:26.200]   And overcast, of course, is a podcast app that you might listen to Mac break weekly,
[01:55:26.200 --> 01:55:30.000]   for example, on or security now or Twitter or one of the other shows.
[01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:31.240]   And this has some nice features.
[01:55:31.240 --> 01:55:33.160]   It's got, for example, a dark mode.
[01:55:33.160 --> 01:55:36.640]   And it's also got a feature where if there's other files that aren't podcast, but you want
[01:55:36.640 --> 01:55:41.600]   to listen to them on overcast, you can upload them and then listen to them anytime you want.
[01:55:41.600 --> 01:55:44.880]   Some of these features are for the patrons, only people who have, you know, the app is
[01:55:44.880 --> 01:55:47.400]   free now, but you can donate.
[01:55:47.400 --> 01:55:51.880]   I forget the exact amount, but I paid immediately for like three years or something because
[01:55:51.880 --> 01:55:53.520]   I like supporting this stuff.
[01:55:53.520 --> 01:55:55.480]   And then there's just a whole bunch of really, really cool features.
[01:55:55.480 --> 01:55:59.960]   He's also updated it to make it much more battery friendly so that the big EQ thing is
[01:55:59.960 --> 01:56:02.480]   gone now because that was using a lot of cycles.
[01:56:02.480 --> 01:56:07.880]   But overall, he really cares about the craft of making these apps and making the experience
[01:56:07.880 --> 01:56:08.880]   really good.
[01:56:08.880 --> 01:56:11.720]   And I use overcast all the time, especially when I'm in the car.
[01:56:11.720 --> 01:56:13.200]   So really, really solid.
[01:56:13.200 --> 01:56:16.240]   So how does a patronage worker, you kind of like a subscriber?
[01:56:16.240 --> 01:56:17.240]   Yeah.
[01:56:17.240 --> 01:56:20.000]   Well, I think you donate for like, you can choose how much you want to donate for you.
[01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.320]   You have to open the app and double check what it is.
[01:56:22.320 --> 01:56:24.240]   But somebody's saying it's about a buck a month.
[01:56:24.240 --> 01:56:25.680]   Yeah, it works out to that.
[01:56:25.680 --> 01:56:28.800]   And that's a great way to sort of move the sustainable apps if you can do it.
[01:56:28.800 --> 01:56:29.800]   Absolutely.
[01:56:29.800 --> 01:56:30.800]   So, but that is interesting.
[01:56:30.800 --> 01:56:32.600]   The question, I mean, as an app developer, right?
[01:56:32.600 --> 01:56:37.480]   So your patronage features right there are dark theme and file uploads.
[01:56:37.480 --> 01:56:43.040]   So then are you, is it really a patronage feature when you, I mean, is it really, you
[01:56:43.040 --> 01:56:47.600]   know, a sort of a free feature when you're having to provide patronage to get them?
[01:56:47.600 --> 01:56:48.600]   I guess it's interesting.
[01:56:48.600 --> 01:56:51.000]   It's like a thanks model.
[01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:52.000]   Thank you for donating.
[01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:53.000]   Here's a couple.
[01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:54.000]   Yeah.
[01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:55.000]   I mean, it's just semantics.
[01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:56.400]   I mean, it's, you know, if you give him money, you get more stuff.
[01:56:56.400 --> 01:56:58.000]   Apparently he's doing really well with it.
[01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000]   I mean, he had 4,100 people.
[01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.600]   Well, you know, first of all, which is awesome.
[01:57:02.600 --> 01:57:03.600]   He's got a great reputation.
[01:57:03.600 --> 01:57:04.600]   He's very well known.
[01:57:04.600 --> 01:57:05.600]   He's beloved.
[01:57:05.600 --> 01:57:11.520]   And I think patronage models often rely just as our podcast advertising does rely on good.
[01:57:11.520 --> 01:57:15.360]   The good will not towards the product necessarily, but towards the person.
[01:57:15.360 --> 01:57:16.800]   Do you know what I'm saying?
[01:57:16.800 --> 01:57:17.800]   People love Marco.
[01:57:17.800 --> 01:57:19.480]   So they're glad to be his patron.
[01:57:19.480 --> 01:57:23.000]   It's patrons a better word, really, than buying the app.
[01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:26.680]   You're being a patron of Marco.
[01:57:26.680 --> 01:57:30.120]   And I kind of, I think that that, if you've got that reputation, if you've got that name,
[01:57:30.120 --> 01:57:34.040]   and if you've got the fans, that's a better way to do it.
[01:57:34.040 --> 01:57:35.040]   Yeah.
[01:57:35.040 --> 01:57:38.360]   And if you, like again, like if you're a podcast or you're a developer and you built up that
[01:57:38.360 --> 01:57:42.400]   sort of credibility and that sort of good will from the community, then it serves both
[01:57:42.400 --> 01:57:43.720]   your interests really well.
[01:57:43.720 --> 01:57:45.520]   It's relationship marketing.
[01:57:45.520 --> 01:57:47.720]   It's a trust.
[01:57:47.720 --> 01:57:48.720]   That's a trust.
[01:57:48.720 --> 01:57:49.720]   Trust thing.
[01:57:49.720 --> 01:57:50.720]   Overcast is great.
[01:57:50.720 --> 01:57:51.720]   Yeah.
[01:57:51.720 --> 01:57:54.120]   Tell him to add, I'll be a patron if he adds video.
[01:57:54.120 --> 01:57:55.120]   Yeah.
[01:57:55.120 --> 01:57:58.440]   And that's one of the things, but he added streaming recently and that was one of the big requests.
[01:57:58.440 --> 01:58:00.920]   But he's the kind of person who wouldn't just add video.
[01:58:00.920 --> 01:58:04.440]   He'd spend like a year or two building the perfect video engine.
[01:58:04.440 --> 01:58:05.440]   Yeah.
[01:58:05.440 --> 01:58:06.440]   Yeah.
[01:58:06.440 --> 01:58:09.200]   And most of our audience still is audio only.
[01:58:09.200 --> 01:58:10.200]   Yeah.
[01:58:10.200 --> 01:58:16.920]   But enough of it, 20, 30% in some cases, sometimes 50 or 60% are video that, I can't tell them
[01:58:16.920 --> 01:58:19.680]   why you should use overcast because then I'm cutting off my nose.
[01:58:19.680 --> 01:58:23.960]   Well, it's one of those things too, where sometimes like, I don't want to speak for Marco, but
[01:58:23.960 --> 01:58:27.040]   some developers will just say, I don't think I can do that well or better.
[01:58:27.040 --> 01:58:28.360]   So I'm just not going to do that for now.
[01:58:28.360 --> 01:58:29.760]   And if you need that, I totally understand.
[01:58:29.760 --> 01:58:30.760]   Is there apps for that?
[01:58:30.760 --> 01:58:31.760]   I just can't do that.
[01:58:31.760 --> 01:58:32.760]   Yeah.
[01:58:32.760 --> 01:58:33.760]   At least right now.
[01:58:33.760 --> 01:58:34.760]   Absolutely appropriate.
[01:58:34.760 --> 01:58:36.640]   I just, I downloaded a garage band.
[01:58:36.640 --> 01:58:42.000]   I installed the loops and then I opened the hand that feeds and yes, it works even in the
[01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:43.520]   modern garage band.
[01:58:43.520 --> 01:58:45.840]   And this is kind of amazing that you can.
[01:58:45.840 --> 01:58:47.120]   It is so, it is so awesome.
[01:58:47.120 --> 01:58:53.880]   I've made the tracks for a nine inch nails song, every track including the lead vocals
[01:58:53.880 --> 01:58:56.520]   and then remix or just ISO.
[01:58:56.520 --> 01:59:01.640]   You know, if you just want to hear his vocals, you can ISO the vocals.
[01:59:01.640 --> 01:59:04.480]   Got to choose.
[01:59:04.480 --> 01:59:06.000]   Isn't that awesome?
[01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:07.000]   Okay.
[01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:13.600]   I mean, even if you don't do anything with it, it's an education in mixing.
[01:59:13.600 --> 01:59:15.080]   Oh, just watching it.
[01:59:15.080 --> 01:59:16.080]   Just watching it.
[01:59:16.080 --> 01:59:19.120]   He builds up the song, how they how they know.
[01:59:19.120 --> 01:59:20.680]   Yeah, like there's an edit in the vocals.
[01:59:20.680 --> 01:59:22.880]   He's popping this in here.
[01:59:22.880 --> 01:59:23.880]   Yeah.
[01:59:23.880 --> 01:59:24.880]   Yeah.
[01:59:24.880 --> 01:59:27.280]   Were you two until it bleeds?
[01:59:27.280 --> 01:59:28.280]   So neat.
[01:59:28.280 --> 01:59:29.280]   So neat.
[01:59:29.280 --> 01:59:30.600]   That's already.
[01:59:30.600 --> 01:59:31.960]   And I am excited.
[01:59:31.960 --> 01:59:33.040]   I hope they do this.
[01:59:33.040 --> 01:59:35.480]   So that that's the rumor or the fact they're going to do this.
[01:59:35.480 --> 01:59:37.000]   I totally made that up from scratch.
[01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:38.440]   No, there's, I saw a story about it.
[01:59:38.440 --> 01:59:39.440]   I think they are.
[01:59:39.440 --> 01:59:40.440]   Oh, is there?
[01:59:40.440 --> 01:59:41.440]   Yeah.
[01:59:41.440 --> 01:59:42.440]   Oh, I didn't know.
[01:59:42.440 --> 01:59:43.440]   I thought you were quoting from the story.
[01:59:43.440 --> 01:59:44.440]   No, I wasn't quoting from the story.
[01:59:44.440 --> 01:59:45.440]   I don't have to go back.
[01:59:45.440 --> 01:59:48.160]   I think you guys hear a few weeks ago when David Bowie died, there was that track.
[01:59:48.160 --> 01:59:50.360]   I had tweeted it out because that was so amazing.
[01:59:50.360 --> 01:59:53.320]   But it's like to have access to that kind of the isolated vocal tracks.
[01:59:53.320 --> 01:59:54.320]   They had David Bowie.
[01:59:54.320 --> 01:59:55.320]   Weren't they amazing?
[01:59:55.320 --> 01:59:56.320]   They're pretty mercury.
[01:59:56.320 --> 01:59:59.320]   It was isolated under pressure tracks.
[01:59:59.320 --> 02:00:00.320]   Yeah.
[02:00:00.320 --> 02:00:01.320]   It was amazing.
[02:00:01.320 --> 02:00:05.640]   I think this is the DVD extras of music.
[02:00:05.640 --> 02:00:08.240]   I mean, I think they really should release.
[02:00:08.240 --> 02:00:10.520]   If you buy the album, get the tracks.
[02:00:10.520 --> 02:00:14.200]   I know they're worried about stealing and sampling and all that, but boy, it's so great.
[02:00:14.200 --> 02:00:19.320]   But if Apple built something that allows you to do that and to monetize it for the artists,
[02:00:19.320 --> 02:00:21.920]   I mean, that would be a killer feature.
[02:00:21.920 --> 02:00:26.680]   That would be something that would have a lot of people that are really into music,
[02:00:26.680 --> 02:00:30.480]   really rethink where they're at if they're not already using Apple music.
[02:00:30.480 --> 02:00:33.520]   Am I imagining that?
[02:00:33.520 --> 02:00:36.800]   Maybe I'm imagining that I saw a story around that.
[02:00:36.800 --> 02:00:38.120]   Maybe I just want it so bad.
[02:00:38.120 --> 02:00:40.280]   Oh, I think I was confusing.
[02:00:40.280 --> 02:00:41.280]   I think there's a story about it.
[02:00:41.280 --> 02:00:44.040]   The remixes that Apple music is getting, that's what I saw.
[02:00:44.040 --> 02:00:45.040]   Right.
[02:00:45.040 --> 02:00:46.040]   I think that that's the story.
[02:00:46.040 --> 02:00:47.040]   There was a story about remixes.
[02:00:47.040 --> 02:00:50.560]   I don't think, but I think that that could possibly set up the idea that you could let
[02:00:50.560 --> 02:00:58.440]   consumers of Apple music remix stuff by releasing songs on Apple music that you could.
[02:00:58.440 --> 02:01:02.640]   And I've always thought that the subscription service should be, you pay a subscription
[02:01:02.640 --> 02:01:05.160]   and you get that and then you can pay for the songs.
[02:01:05.160 --> 02:01:09.520]   I can pay $10 for the hands of feed me, broken up in the garage band.
[02:01:09.520 --> 02:01:13.280]   And I do that for, take a song that you really love and buy it.
[02:01:13.280 --> 02:01:18.960]   And so, here's why I thought this, the Apple made a deal for these other remixes with a
[02:01:18.960 --> 02:01:25.360]   company called Dubset, which has a proprietary technology called Mixbank that allows you
[02:01:25.360 --> 02:01:29.560]   to remix songs.
[02:01:29.560 --> 02:01:33.440]   And then the artist, of course, says yes or no to the remix, but that seems to me that
[02:01:33.440 --> 02:01:39.520]   there's an engine there that could be opened to the public, which is very interesting.
[02:01:39.520 --> 02:01:41.480]   All right.
[02:01:41.480 --> 02:01:44.600]   So maybe it's not such a fantasy.
[02:01:44.600 --> 02:01:48.200]   So as you know, I have a fetish.
[02:01:48.200 --> 02:01:50.520]   Let's be honest, I do your iPhone.
[02:01:50.520 --> 02:01:52.760]   You can't make your phone a fetish.
[02:01:52.760 --> 02:01:56.640]   No, my phone is not fetishized, but my handbags are.
[02:01:56.640 --> 02:01:57.640]   Yes.
[02:01:57.640 --> 02:02:01.520]   And apparently people know that, right?
[02:02:01.520 --> 02:02:10.120]   And Ron G, who is kind of a weak talk on Telegram, sent me a picture of his bag.
[02:02:10.120 --> 02:02:11.360]   He says, first of all, it's not a handbag.
[02:02:11.360 --> 02:02:13.560]   It's a travel bag from Duluth Trading Company.
[02:02:13.560 --> 02:02:15.040]   You've probably all heard of Duluth.
[02:02:15.040 --> 02:02:16.520]   I'm wearing their underwear right now.
[02:02:16.520 --> 02:02:20.360]   I'm wearing their underwear right now, says Clayton Morris.
[02:02:20.360 --> 02:02:21.360]   It's a great place.
[02:02:21.360 --> 02:02:22.360]   I love it.
[02:02:22.360 --> 02:02:23.360]   Well, they make this travel bag.
[02:02:23.360 --> 02:02:24.360]   It's about 150 bucks.
[02:02:24.360 --> 02:02:25.360]   So here's what I've been carrying.
[02:02:25.360 --> 02:02:30.280]   And I love my, you know, it all came about because my keychain was so big it was giving
[02:02:30.280 --> 02:02:31.280]   me sciatica.
[02:02:31.280 --> 02:02:38.440]   I was having nerve issues in my leg from a giant reason I got their underwear.
[02:02:38.440 --> 02:02:39.960]   And then I happened to see this.
[02:02:39.960 --> 02:02:43.880]   I was in San Diego at the Coronado and they have a nice leather store and I saw this bag
[02:02:43.880 --> 02:02:44.960]   and I said, I have to have it.
[02:02:44.960 --> 02:02:46.600]   It's just kind of like a saddle bag.
[02:02:46.600 --> 02:02:47.600]   But and I love it.
[02:02:47.600 --> 02:02:48.760]   It's made of horn-ween leather.
[02:02:48.760 --> 02:02:52.400]   It's beautiful, but it doesn't have any real pouches.
[02:02:52.400 --> 02:02:53.720]   And that's been kind of a problem.
[02:02:53.720 --> 02:02:57.200]   So I've been carrying it around and I like it, but I want some more organization.
[02:02:57.200 --> 02:03:01.080]   This is the, it's less expensive.
[02:03:01.080 --> 02:03:03.320]   This is the Duluth Trading Company Travel Bag.
[02:03:03.320 --> 02:03:06.240]   And this has zippers and pouches galore.
[02:03:06.240 --> 02:03:08.160]   In fact, it even has, which I really like.
[02:03:08.160 --> 02:03:13.120]   And the reason I'm making it a pick on Macbreak Weekly, a special neoprene padded pouch suitable
[02:03:13.120 --> 02:03:14.120]   for an iPad.
[02:03:14.120 --> 02:03:16.320]   Let me see if I can get this open.
[02:03:16.320 --> 02:03:18.200]   If I already broken it, no, there it is.
[02:03:18.200 --> 02:03:23.960]   So you could put the iPad in this neoprene padded pouch, but that's not the, that's
[02:03:23.960 --> 02:03:24.960]   not the last of it.
[02:03:24.960 --> 02:03:27.600]   There's pouches all over the place.
[02:03:27.600 --> 02:03:29.520]   Extra little zipper pouches here and there.
[02:03:29.520 --> 02:03:30.880]   You can store everything.
[02:03:30.880 --> 02:03:35.560]   And you know, once you start carrying a bag and I warn you, don't, you start carrying
[02:03:35.560 --> 02:03:42.280]   a lot of stuff in your bag, like headphones and USB keys with varieties of operating
[02:03:42.280 --> 02:03:44.560]   systems and pens and so forth.
[02:03:44.560 --> 02:03:45.560]   Should I try the iPad Pro?
[02:03:45.560 --> 02:03:47.440]   I doubt the Pro would fit in there.
[02:03:47.440 --> 02:03:50.800]   This is I think more for the new iPad Pro.
[02:03:50.800 --> 02:03:54.000]   Let me, let me just see if it, well, I take it back.
[02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:57.000]   Now, see, it's, it's not going to fit the neoprene pouches.
[02:03:57.000 --> 02:04:02.400]   Too big for, but this is too big for anything, frankly, the iPad Pro.
[02:04:02.400 --> 02:04:06.280]   But it would fit a regular iPad in there, just fine or mini.
[02:04:06.280 --> 02:04:10.040]   And I should try it with a MacBook because that's one thing I do carry around a lot.
[02:04:10.040 --> 02:04:16.640]   So just a, you know, my newest fetish object, it's not a mercy.
[02:04:16.640 --> 02:04:20.000]   It's a travel bag and it's from the Duluth Trading Company.
[02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:21.000]   They make nice stuff.
[02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:22.640]   It really, it's European.
[02:04:22.640 --> 02:04:28.600]   It's European carry all really nicely made and it's got a handle, which my other one didn't.
[02:04:28.600 --> 02:04:29.600]   I like it.
[02:04:29.600 --> 02:04:30.600]   So there's my pick.
[02:04:30.600 --> 02:04:34.120]   I did that for Andy because Andy's always doing stuff like that.
[02:04:34.120 --> 02:04:39.280]   Bags and, you know, dresses, stuff like that.
[02:04:39.280 --> 02:04:43.640]   And it is, of course, made from leather from Happy Cows.
[02:04:43.640 --> 02:04:45.760]   Harvested from cows are already dead.
[02:04:45.760 --> 02:04:47.320]   I don't know.
[02:04:47.320 --> 02:04:50.200]   So if you're a vegan, I apologize.
[02:04:50.200 --> 02:04:51.760]   Oh, they didn't skin them alive.
[02:04:51.760 --> 02:04:52.760]   That's good.
[02:04:52.760 --> 02:04:53.760]   They didn't skin them alive.
[02:04:53.760 --> 02:04:57.520]   They were already knocked out.
[02:04:57.520 --> 02:04:58.520]   Ladies and gentlemen, thank you.
[02:04:58.520 --> 02:04:59.880]   Whoa, we had a great studio audience.
[02:04:59.880 --> 02:05:00.880]   I don't know.
[02:05:00.880 --> 02:05:03.200]   Is there something going on in the town that we got all these people here?
[02:05:03.200 --> 02:05:04.200]   What's going on?
[02:05:04.200 --> 02:05:06.080]   Oh, the show Mac Break Weekly.
[02:05:06.080 --> 02:05:07.080]   I heard of that.
[02:05:07.080 --> 02:05:08.080]   It's a good show.
[02:05:08.080 --> 02:05:09.080]   I enjoy that.
[02:05:09.080 --> 02:05:10.600]   Very nice to have you all.
[02:05:10.600 --> 02:05:13.440]   If you want to be here, you can email tickets at twit.tv.
[02:05:13.440 --> 02:05:17.360]   Although, as I told you, my friend, just show up.
[02:05:17.360 --> 02:05:18.360]   We'll let you in.
[02:05:18.360 --> 02:05:19.840]   You know, it's not a big deal.
[02:05:19.840 --> 02:05:23.880]   As long as we've got the room, the reason we ask for emails is so we kind of can do a
[02:05:23.880 --> 02:05:27.560]   headcount and my office, so the show's like security now, which is coming up.
[02:05:27.560 --> 02:05:29.040]   There's really only four or five seats in there.
[02:05:29.040 --> 02:05:31.200]   So we don't want anybody to be disappointed.
[02:05:31.200 --> 02:05:33.520]   Come here and be disappointed.
[02:05:33.520 --> 02:05:36.640]   If you're going to be here, we'd love to have it open studio.
[02:05:36.640 --> 02:05:41.600]   This is, I'm sad to say, kind of the end days for the old Brick House studio, the new
[02:05:41.600 --> 02:05:42.600]   Twit Studios.
[02:05:42.600 --> 02:05:46.000]   We've leased and we'll start the build soon.
[02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:50.880]   As soon as the landlord finishes his tenant improvements, we're going to start our studio
[02:05:50.880 --> 02:05:51.880]   build.
[02:05:51.880 --> 02:05:52.880]   We'll move a lot of this over.
[02:05:52.880 --> 02:05:55.800]   It will look pretty much the same.
[02:05:55.800 --> 02:05:59.000]   We'll probably be in there, we think, around August or September.
[02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:01.520]   Don't delay if you've been thinking coming here.
[02:06:01.520 --> 02:06:02.520]   You want to see it.
[02:06:02.520 --> 02:06:05.040]   You want to visit your Brick.
[02:06:05.040 --> 02:06:06.520]   So thank you for coming.
[02:06:06.520 --> 02:06:07.520]   Tickets@twit.tv.
[02:06:07.520 --> 02:06:12.000]   Of course, if you want to watch live, we are live 11 AM Pacific, 2 PM Eastern Time every
[02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:14.000]   Tuesday.
[02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:18.200]   Remember, we are now in our summertime here in the United States.
[02:06:18.200 --> 02:06:19.440]   We moved our clocks.
[02:06:19.440 --> 02:06:24.400]   Obviously UTC does not, but it does mean relative UTC we've moved.
[02:06:24.400 --> 02:06:27.920]   So it is now 1800 UTC that we begin the show.
[02:06:27.920 --> 02:06:31.040]   You have to do the calculations based on your own summertime.
[02:06:31.040 --> 02:06:33.720]   And it's going to end it.
[02:06:33.720 --> 02:06:34.720]   Stop the insanity.
[02:06:34.720 --> 02:06:35.720]   So I don't have to do that.
[02:06:35.720 --> 02:06:41.160]   I have to change my whole head and recalculate all my times.
[02:06:41.160 --> 02:06:43.000]   If you want to watch live, we'd love it if you do.
[02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:48.040]   But if you can't figure out daylight saving time, you can always watch on demand and watch
[02:06:48.040 --> 02:06:49.520]   whatever you want.
[02:06:49.520 --> 02:06:50.520]   Every show is available.
[02:06:50.520 --> 02:06:54.120]   Click.tv/mbw for this one.
[02:06:54.120 --> 02:06:59.280]   But also in overcast any other podcaster you choose or the great Twit apps which are available
[02:06:59.280 --> 02:07:00.280]   everywhere.
[02:07:00.280 --> 02:07:02.040]   And I wish I could take credit for them, but I can.
[02:07:02.040 --> 02:07:06.080]   It's actually, I'm glad I can't because it's our great fans that write those apps.
[02:07:06.080 --> 02:07:07.080]   Now five.
[02:07:07.080 --> 02:07:10.840]   Now count them five apps on the Apple TV.
[02:07:10.840 --> 02:07:14.880]   Thanks to Mike and Craig and all the other great developers who've done such a nice job.
[02:07:14.880 --> 02:07:16.040]   And thanks to you for being here.
[02:07:16.040 --> 02:07:20.000]   But I'm sad to say it's time to get back to work because guess what?
[02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:21.560]   Time is over.
[02:07:21.560 --> 02:07:24.160]   (upbeat music)
[02:07:24.160 --> 02:07:26.740]   (upbeat music)
[02:07:26.740 --> 02:07:29.320]   (upbeat music)
[02:07:29.320 --> 02:07:31.320]   You
