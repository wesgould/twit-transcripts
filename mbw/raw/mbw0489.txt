[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:13.760]   Also here Renee Ritchie from i'm war.com
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.800]   Hey Leo. Hey nice haircut. Thank you very much. I clean myself up a little bit
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:26.800]   Yeah, cleaned up looks good and all the way from Washington DC mr. Alex Lindsey of the pixel core fame. Hello Alex
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.320]   Hello. Hello. Good to see you. I have not cleaned up. I'm gonna head on no, but you look at that kind of like you look
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.840]   Are you in the Charlie Rose studio? I'm not I'm not I'm in a server room. I think
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:45.520]   It's got a bunch of old drives in the back, you know, it's very classy. So uh, it was the quietest place I could find
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.480]   I was reading uh
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.600]   Interview with tesla who said it's just an open-seek with tesla his name is elan musk
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:03:00.720]   I just call him nica like tesla. He said it's a manifestly obvious that apple's doing an electric car, but who cares? It's good for the uh business
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:07.760]   Yep, so now we know apple's doing an electric car wasn't enough for the wall street journal elan musk has confirmed it
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.200]   Possibly because of the brain drain over there
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.880]   Uh, said the higher is made it obvious to people
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.280]   You can't hire a thousand engineers in silicon valley with that everybody knowing what you're up to
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.560]   Yes, that's probably the case. I think almost anywhere you start hiring a thousand of the same thing people go well
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.560]   Yeah, not a hobby anymore
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.240]   and
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.640]   Was there any uh before we go on to other
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.600]   Stories was there anything in ces?
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.120]   apple related that's worth talking about no none of you went to
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:43.840]   Vegas over the weekend over the week. No, I thought it was interesting that that I guess vw wanted to show carplay wireless
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.880]   And the news is apple told them not to or ask them not to show it
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:56.800]   Trust and it's it's unclear exactly why I think some of the speculation is is that apple wants to show it in a more robust form later in the year
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:04.320]   Um, but it was interesting that they that's what vw said is that they were asked by the the vendor not to make some
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.640]   Ford announced that they would support both android auto and carplay
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.480]   um
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.120]   So and that's starting well, it's interesting because that's starting in 2017
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.920]   So that means this fall when the 2017 models become available
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.560]   But some 2016 models will be upgradable
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.680]   And software so if you have sync three on a four that you buy this year
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.640]   I have to say my car buying to say I have to buy a new car in september my lease runs out
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.520]   and um
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.520]   It's gotten complicated
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.040]   I don't uh, I don't know exactly
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.760]   I really want carplay and and but I also want android auto
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.080]   But I presume anybody does want to do the other you want electric and do you want the current electric or is the technology going to get
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.800]   Yeah, right. Yeah. Yeah, it's really complicated. Yeah
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.400]   It's a phenomenal time though like as the systems get more sophisticated you do get the ability to
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:04.240]   separate the software of the car from the hardware and so it's one of the most exciting
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:09.920]   Developments in in like personal cars is the idea of you buy a tesla and then two years later
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:14.800]   It can do something it didn't it couldn't do leaving the factory just by getting an automatic update
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.840]   uh, so the idea of future proofing a car
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:26.080]   Uh and adding features that go beyond simply bolting a cosmetic rear spoiler and flame decals. Uh, it's pretty exciting
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:32.640]   Uh any who so so v dub for who else is going to do carplay
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:38.400]   I think apple just released a list a list they have a web page now. I believe that
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:44.640]   That has an entire list of every and it's basically all the vd every model and then random things of everybody else
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.320]   So I guess vw has really
[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.320]   uh jumped on the on the carplay
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:53.680]   bandwagon, I gotta see it no Ferrari. I guess that's because eddy q's on the board, but it looked really nice in a in a california
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:59.680]   the interest the other carmaker interesting is that uh toyota as
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:04.560]   Just said goodbye says as turned its nose at both uh android auto and carplay
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.080]   And they're using something that they're building on top of uh, a
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:12.240]   Open ish system that ford has put together, uh oddly enough
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:17.840]   Uh, so uh, it's there the the excuse that they're the explanation that they're given
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:22.640]   Their giving is that they feel as though by letting a creating set of apis for this new system
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:28.400]   They can allow developers to have much richer access to car features than uh, android auto or carplay
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:34.880]   currently support, uh, but the other thing that you hear a lot from people in the auto industry is that they're
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.360]   uh hesitant about
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.760]   giving access to
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:42.000]   apple and google and worried that
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.720]   A year later or a year or a couple of years later
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:50.960]   They might change the terms of those in terms of how much data they're expected to deliver to apple or google and say well
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.400]   No, that's proprietary. That's valuable stuff and we don't want to give it a we don't either
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:59.760]   We don't want to give it away. Also. We don't want to ensure that we can't give it away to somebody else
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:02.880]   And so this is more uh more of toyota trying to
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:07.440]   Future proof its own interests rather than trying to screw over commoners, but that's dumb
[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:10.160]   It was a pretty loud move though. Yeah
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.320]   So here is the apple page
[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:17.040]   They say more than a hundred models to choose from a couple of models of outy couple of models of buick
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:20.000]   Looks like most of the cadillac 2016
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.720]   Models chevy
[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:26.800]   Wow pretty much everybody, you know, it's funny the new bolt which they announced
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.120]   They're all electric car
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:34.800]   Not on this list the vault is but not the bolt. The bolt isn't released yet. Isn't the bolt doesn't come out until 2017
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:40.320]   Okay, so maybe they just haven't said anything. These are all 2016 miles for chevy spark cruise malibu camaro
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.800]   Silverado and paula vault Corvette
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:45.700]   Colorado tahoe and suburban cetra
[00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:48.800]   Cetra I would like a cetra
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:52.000]   I don't know what ds is
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:57.360]   Ferrari look at that the california t the spider the gtb the berlin that of the tdf and the ff
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:01.520]   That's all of them right. I don't know. I'm not I'm not I'm not complete
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.800]   The law Ferrari which I believe eddy q drives is not on that list
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:08.800]   2017 Ford escape
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:15.120]   But for did say I think all of their 2017 models with as long as they have sync three in them, which is not obviously everything
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:17.120]   That's probably an option
[00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:19.440]   GMc honda
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:20.480]   Hyundai
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.480]   Mercedes Benz Mitsubishi
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:26.800]   Opal glass. See they still make cars Porsche
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:29.920]   Puzhio
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.760]   seat
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:33.760]   The I want a seat abita
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:37.520]   Or is it pronounced? Yeah, a visa abita
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:39.920]   scotta
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:42.560]   Or scoda suzuki v dub
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:45.200]   Volvo yeah, no Toyota in that list
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.400]   I'm just by the study into
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:51.600]   Yeah, you know that I was gonna get a Tesla, but now I'm thinking well
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:55.280]   I don't know if I really would want a Tesla if I doesn't do it and read it or car play
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:09:02.320]   Competitors they seem as competitors Leo. Yeah, they and I'm maybe they're right. I don't know I I what what kind of uh
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:07.920]   Oh, I see I like the idea that my smartphone is gonna get updated very regularly
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:11.440]   And the hard was gonna get updated every year or two
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.600]   So shouldn't the shouldn't the smart to the car really be uh integrated with the car with the smartphone
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:21.120]   Where where you're gonna really get some more upgrades and you're gonna get on your regular car
[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:24.480]   All I want well the other the other argument is that uh
[00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:30.320]   Would you rather have a truly bespoke entertainment a navigation experience?
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:36.560]   Something that is really designed to not to work with absolutely every car but is absolutely fine tuned to work with your car
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:38.960]   So I don't I don't think that anybody's shown a preference yet
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:42.160]   And I don't even think that uh that google or apple has shown
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:47.280]   Uh has really shown that breakthrough killer feature that says no, absolutely
[00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:52.000]   We would uh want to have this sort of system of bluetooth will not cut it and in car system will not cut it
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.720]   We really want all these apps to be served from our phones instead
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:57.680]   BMW also missing somebody the chamor said that's true
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:04.000]   But the the only thing that i'm really glad about though is that back when all this uh started the this talk started
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.760]   I was worried about this there's going to be sort of vhs versus beta thing
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.680]   But the car company seem to be way too smart for that and if they're supporting one
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:14.400]   They're almost always supporting the other or the supporting none
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:17.680]   So it's not as though you're kind of screwed if you have both a
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:23.200]   An android phone and a car or you have an iphone and a car you have to if you want to own a car
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:26.400]   You should also own an android phone or else nothing's going to work with it
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:30.640]   It really is they're going to accommodate pretty much whatever your platform of choices. Here's the uh
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:33.360]   Here's a video of the tesla
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:38.320]   Media says me as you say bespoke is the when you have a 17 inch screen
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:40.320]   You can really
[00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:46.160]   So many really good interface engineers and software engineering world and we've seen a lot of consumer electronics companies try to do software
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:49.120]   And it hasn't always gone well. Yeah much to happen google's acrylic
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:54.560]   They've really made a good they they've done everything they can not to make proprietary like they're building these systems on top of
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:58.160]   Yeah, cunix or other systems. I like what they're doing. I tried to lock them down at all
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.400]   Yeah, but if he's if you spend time
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:04.240]   Work using one of these tesla systems. It really is nice how
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:07.280]   It's just so intimate with all of your hard words
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:13.120]   When when your car leaves the factory not only of course you get the this little like digital model of your car
[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:16.720]   So when it as when it's changing the ride level when it's turning things on and off
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:19.120]   It's updated on this little cartoon, but it's also
[00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:24.800]   It's your car color. It has all of your car options on it. Wow all those tiny little details
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.600]   So it doesn't look like a generic outline. It really is your car
[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:31.760]   That's kind of cool. And that's just one example of the ways that the the tesla center console
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:35.360]   You you if it's probably the only center console system
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:40.640]   I've seen where I would absolutely prefer to just having my car my my phone in a car mount
[00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:45.360]   Right, I haven't even I haven't even seen any android auto or car play systems where it's like
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:53.920]   Okay, that's nice, but it's not necessarily nicer than having my little $50 ram mount right car mount for for my phone
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:55.520]   right
[00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:58.960]   Well, and I have to admit I still go back and forth thinking about whether
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:00.640]   I
[00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:05.680]   How much integration I want with my car I find when I rent cars and I play around with the
[00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:09.360]   Like the bluetooth integration or whatever with my with my phone
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:12.640]   I get kind of annoyed that as soon as it comes in it starts jumping around and start
[00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:17.520]   You know all my phone calls start coming through on the phone and I mean on the in the car because I don't think the mic sounds good
[00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:22.880]   And so there's all these things that that I'm still kind of I as I go for because
[00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:28.080]   Like you Leo, I'm looking for a car and I'm deciding I'm kind of going either total tech or total retro and I don't know which
[00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:32.240]   This is this does kind of work though because look you can you can go to
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:35.200]   Your music devices and if you've paired your phone
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:39.760]   It does give you a fairly decent interface to the phone's music interface
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:43.120]   And as they show here, you can plug in a usb
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:47.280]   Uh key it'll show up and any music on there will also play
[00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:52.560]   But but then there's maps and there's other things and I I hear the tesla gps is actually not all that
[00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:58.880]   Good. I I feel like google and app are working nice if they just let us use part of it. Yeah,
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:02.960]   Skill is a little bit. Yeah, just give us a little bit of that 17
[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:07.680]   That nothing can nothing can even top like the free ways app is just exactly
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:14.960]   Just that ability to know that okay eight miles away. There is a tractor trailer that has put chickens on both sides of i95
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:17.040]   Perhaps i'm gonna avoid that right now. Now
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.200]   If you have carplay does that mean you could use other apps or do you have to use the apple map?
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:26.880]   They have to have car plays like overcast for example has carplay support
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:29.520]   I believe it's still a partnering system. Not anybody can make it
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:32.720]   Okay, you have to talk to apple about doing it, but there are several apps that have carplay
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:38.880]   So potentially you could have ways in google maps as well as apple maps for instance on your screen
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:42.880]   See that seems just so much better in every respect
[00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:46.240]   Well great for rentals like I want to just land it and right go pick up a car
[00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:50.880]   Not worry about the car because every car even like toyota all their cars have different interfaces and they're so confusing
[00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:55.360]   I just want to get in there have the maps. I know the music. I love all of that in one place. I drive out
[00:13:55.360 --> 00:14:01.840]   You uh, i'm more did send michael gartenberg down to uh, we didn't send that we so this is an interesting story michael gartenberg
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:06.160]   He was an analyst at gartner and then he worked very briefly at microsoft and for the last two years
[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:08.480]   He was senior director of product marketing at apple
[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:14.560]   And that is he ended his time at apple right on the new year. Oh, so we very quickly asked him to write his thoughts on
[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:16.880]   Oh, so he's not an i'm more employee. He's a freelancer
[00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:22.720]   Yeah, well, he's doing a few articles for us. Oh good. All right and uh, and what was his conclusion?
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:25.120]   What you know, one other apple news was there from uh?
[00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:31.200]   Well, he kind of distilled it down into several trends like he called it jokingly the toaster fridge because they're really right
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:35.760]   They were all sorts of enabled devices that are smart, but maybe don't need to be smart
[00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:39.840]   And again with television they didn't manage to get us to buy the biggest one of the biggest conversions
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:43.520]   Of course was going to flat panel televisions in ten ADP and those are really good enough
[00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:46.400]   So we didn't care about 3d and now they're trying hdr
[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:50.960]   And i'm gonna care about hdr is 4k going to be enough when is the next big transition going to happen
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:57.040]   So it's interesting to see this year cs seem to be sort of one of those transitional years where they're trying a lot of things
[00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:01.280]   But no really huge trends really took nothing nothing blew me away fit bit kind of
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:09.120]   Went straight up against the apple watch with its fit bit blaze, which i have unfortunately ordered and
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:12.080]   Wish i could cancel 199
[00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:16.880]   A nice fine. There were a bunch of analysts immediately who said oh, this is how you're spending our investment money. Oh
[00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:20.320]   And that didn't sound great. Oh
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:24.000]   It's a fitness watch that says stylish is is smart
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.040]   Well, I have to review it. So I guess you know
[00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:30.640]   It does it does work with the iphone. I guess
[00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:35.360]   It's a it's a super interesting space and it takes advantage of at least the perception
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:41.680]   That neither apple nor google or mojorilla have really spiked the ball when it comes to making a smartwatch
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:48.320]   There seems to be still a lot of room for a lot of consumers who just want a super super fitness enabled
[00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:53.040]   Risk watch and they don't care if there's this huge set of app apis
[00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:57.520]   They don't care about opening your garage door and seeing live video of the door opening
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:02.000]   They just want to know what's my heart rate and get notifications off of your phone
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:06.480]   So it's a the door is still wide open and this is why we're seeing so many of these devices like this
[00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:09.120]   Especially if they get a few hundred bucks or less, right?
[00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:11.920]   It seems easier to enter too like not everybody could make a phone
[00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:16.320]   Not everybody could make a tablet yet to have a platform like basically a computing platform to build it off of
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:19.760]   Whereas watches all sorts of different companies from the computer companies
[00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:23.840]   Two brand new companies like fitbit or can make really valid efforts at a smart
[00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:25.680]   smartwatch
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:28.320]   Everybody said it was really ugly though. I didn't see it. I just
[00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:31.920]   See I see how many square corners in a while
[00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:36.640]   I mean, I can see how how how fitbit would feel like they have to move towards the watch
[00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:42.000]   Because you know the idea of having a mono task thing even if it's got time on it. I mean when I had the Nike
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.040]   Whatever I called it. Um, but the whatever you call the little wristband
[00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:49.680]   It was yeah, it was it was nice
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:52.080]   It was nice that it had time
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:54.560]   But but at the same time I was
[00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:57.600]   You know, I really felt like you know what now they have the app watch
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:02.640]   I have all the things that I had there except that I have a whole bunch of other little features that I'm using fairly often
[00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:08.400]   Yeah, and uh, uh, obama was on comedians and cars getting coffee a couple weeks ago. Oh, yeah
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:11.920]   He was wearing a fitness band wasn't he he's wearing he was wearing a fitbit surge
[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:18.800]   Which is not like a tiny little band. It was like in replacement of the really cool super oyster watch that I'd seen him
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:24.320]   Wearing before I can't imagine that the secret service allows him to wear a wireless tracking device
[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:30.000]   Like that off of white house grounds, but it's it's interesting. These are things
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.080]   I'm sort of paying attention to you saw
[00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:37.040]   The the week that the apple watch was released you see all these celebrities wearing them
[00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:41.120]   Particularly if tim cook or someone was on like the colbert show
[00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:45.760]   Uh, and I kept just sort of paying attention to see okay. Are they going?
[00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:51.520]   Are they continuing to wear their apple watch and colbert's was office risk like two weeks later?
[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:56.880]   However, jaylinnoh who used to wear I had such a cool watch earlier that I had to look it up some
[00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:59.760]   Sake $3,000 three dials seiko watch
[00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:03.520]   Uh, but he seems to like his stainless steel apple watch
[00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:05.520]   So it's it's an interesting thing to track
[00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:08.400]   It it just it just seemed interesting to me that even obama
[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:17.040]   Would choose to wear a much simpler fitness watch than uh apple watch not not that he doesn't have people reminding him of things all the time
[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:20.400]   But he is a human to do notification
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:25.520]   Stand up, please. So just to prove his personal fitness track. He would need the electronics anymore
[00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:30.000]   Actually, I think that this is probably the I hate to say it, but the surge seems like the
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.920]   If if fitness is what you're going for. It seems like the best
[00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:41.360]   Compromise also fit. It has this really good social network to connect you to other people that you're working out with or you're friendly with
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:45.760]   So it's it's such a it's there's so many interesting variables associated with all this
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:49.440]   Maybe people don't necessarily want the miraculous new digital stem
[00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:52.400]   They just want the ability to automatically know
[00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:57.120]   What the how their friends are doing and make sure that if your friends all your friends went out for a run today
[00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:01.280]   Then you're not going to let them go one up on use it now. You're going to go out on a run today. Right
[00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:03.840]   I really miss that on the iOS
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:06.560]   activity app on the watch i wish because on the fit that you see
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:10.720]   Your team and how you're doing and how you're ranked and it really it really gives you impetus to go
[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:14.000]   And there's nothing like that on activities yet. You're nice to add
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.640]   Apple watch too is probably gonna
[00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:23.440]   Appear we think i'll tell you there's now some some compelling evidence since we can pair two watches to
[00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:29.280]   To our iphone that apple might be releasing a second watch and march come march. Yeah, new risks
[00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:31.360]   That's so that's an economic opportunity. Yeah
[00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:32.880]   Yeah
[00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:34.880]   What do you think rene is that uh?
[00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:39.200]   iOS 9.3 beta came out. I know you would have immediately installed it probably yeah
[00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:44.080]   No, I think the watch uh so apple typically for next generation products a lot of people get concerned
[00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:47.840]   I just bought an apple watch i'm not gonna buy another one. It's crazy, but apple's not targeting us
[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:50.320]   They're targeting the people like us who buy everything of course
[00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:52.000]   But they're not targeting regular consumers
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:57.600]   This is similar to the iphone 3g or the ipad 2 where there's still an enormous amount of people who haven't bought an apple watch yet
[00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:00.080]   And they would sort of want to figure out what features are compelling
[00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:05.440]   I know some people still want it to be thinner because they have a trouble getting underneath their short sleeves when especially when they wear suits
[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:09.360]   Some people really want gps some people really want ambient always on time
[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:10.800]   I'm not to turn their wrist to see it
[00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:16.000]   There's whatever there is there's a bunch of features that have stopped people from buying them and usually the second models where apple figures out
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:21.600]   Who features that they can add the best the highest value to without destroying things like battery life and in apps
[00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:23.840]   Right
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:29.760]   That's an excellent point because uh we forget we we are deeply into apple and we're also we really enjoy
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:33.840]   And can appreciate the stuff that makes like the first iphone different from all of their phones
[00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:39.040]   Uh, it's almost as though most apple products have two separate and significant launches
[00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:47.040]   Uh, there was the original iphone, but it wasn't until the iphone 3g s that it became all the people that sort of admired the iphone and liked it
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:51.360]   That was the one where all the pieces are finally in place if you're you don't have to be a fan of apple
[00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:56.000]   You don't have to be on the next page of technology to really get the maximum benefit out of it
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.480]   Uh, I certainly don't think that the the uh, I certainly don't think that the apple watch is there yet
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:06.320]   But as soon as apple solves a couple of unknown as yet unidentified problems
[00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:12.560]   They're gonna have the apple watch 3gs that now everybody wants to have it doesn't we don't have to suffer in order to get it
[00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:14.560]   It'll be really a mass market sort of thing
[00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:19.680]   Yeah, and I think that I think that at some point apple just had to throw one on the you know throw something out there and see
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:24.400]   Uh, how people use it. That's how you learn is stuff in the lab and you want to have it
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:27.520]   Be perfect, but in the same, you know with a lot of these things that you know
[00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:32.480]   They they sold a lot of you know, they didn't sell me as many watches as analysts thought but they did so a lot
[00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:36.160]   So they've got a lot of people working, you know playing with it giving feedback talking about it
[00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:38.000]   And of course they're ready to iterate
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.840]   I mean it sounds like they had a pretty good idea where they were gonna go for version two and three
[00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:44.880]   So they're they already know that they just had to get something on the ground
[00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:46.880]   So I think that it's um, we're definitely gonna see it
[00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:50.320]   And that's again why I bought the sport instead of I was really looking at all the expensive ones
[00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:53.920]   And I was like, you know what? I'm gonna want to maybe not every single version
[00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:59.120]   Most versions upgrade and so I'm just gonna go with the cheaper version and just know that I'm ready to go
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.800]   Yeah, and this is really different for apple because there were 10 years of smartphones
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:05.600]   There were all the blackberries and all the trios before the iphone came out
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:10.000]   And there was a decade of tablet pcs before the ipad and they sort of identified what they thought were problems
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:15.680]   And it would help them make a more mainstream product and with the apple watch there wasn't that there were a few watches
[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:18.640]   On the market, but you know, you could hear people like pebble say
[00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:24.800]   We're in the we're in the palm five sort of era of smart watches till that's very early by apple standards
[00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:27.280]   They they had to be part of the experimentation here
[00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:31.520]   And it's clear that things like apps maybe on the watch apps can't work the way they work on the phone
[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:35.200]   Maybe they have to work through notifications or through complications or through some other
[00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:39.360]   Abstraction and modularization and it's not clear. We have all those answers yet
[00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:42.960]   Watch 2.0
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:45.040]   We can think of a few things they might do with it
[00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:47.040]   Yep
[00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:51.200]   Camera maybe FaceTime camera gps gps would be nice
[00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:53.360]   Some of those
[00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:57.120]   Most of the other smart watches have assisted gps you need a phone
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:02.240]   Although I noted that the that the president obama fit bit has a gps built into it
[00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:07.280]   Garmin has a dish yet another reason why he doesn't want to wear that outside of the palace it do rounds
[00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:09.200]   Did uh
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:13.760]   I know that there's been there's talk about more custom like allowing developers to really do all the
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:19.680]   Complications and everything else on the watch base is that is that already has that progressed or is that something we're still waiting for
[00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:24.800]   Watch OS 2.0 let them make custom complications so they can put things on they can't change the way the watch face looks
[00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:28.480]   But they can fill up those little bubbles on the watch face with stuff from their apps
[00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:34.480]   Right. Yeah, because it's it's one of those things that I really really want to be able to design that it's
[00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:38.480]   There's a whole bunch of might get it, but none of them are quite what I want
[00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:41.280]   Then I'll just win a license
[00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:43.120]   I'm sorry to do list. I'm sorry go ahead
[00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:47.600]   My to-do list for the apple watch has nothing to do with hardware. I think the hardware
[00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:54.080]   If anything I've had them remove let's say the digital stem and turn it into just a plain clicky button because I wouldn't call it a failure
[00:23:54.080 --> 00:24:01.520]   I just don't think that anything apple software included has really sold the point of why you want to have a scrolly scrolly scrolly thing
[00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:06.800]   Instead of just tapping tapping the screen all the things that I would like to improve have to do with software and they include
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:11.680]   The complications and they certainly include the ability for developers to create their own watch faces
[00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:13.760]   I mean one of the one that it sounds stupid
[00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:20.000]   But one of the things that I really appreciated the most about going back to android where was just the ability to put on whatever
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:26.720]   Whatever watch face I want and choose between not just you know green bay packers homemade gif
[00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:33.600]   A background but like really great designers making beautiful watch faces that aren't just simple
[00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:39.920]   You know not sans serif white text on black and I don't I don't quite get I don't quite get why we're not able to make
[00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:45.040]   Wide developers aren't able to make watch faces like what the thought process was there it doesn't seem like it would
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:49.440]   I know it doesn't make any sense. Yeah, there's like two layers. One is that ui clock kit which
[00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:54.320]   I think it's called nano clock kit is the the frameworks all this was very new like they shipped this
[00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:57.920]   With the software coming in really hot and it took them another
[00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:04.320]   Few months before they could allow custom complications and probably abstracting out clock kit into a custom stk will take a while as well
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:08.800]   But the other one is they they really are apple and they don't allow you to do much on the iphone home screen
[00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:13.760]   They are not gonna let you do much on the the watch and had part so part of it is technical and part of it is cultural
[00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:17.280]   Yeah, look at how much work we put into those jellyfish movies
[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:23.600]   But even like allowing like right now you can make custom photograph an album art
[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:27.520]   Covers and I have a superman one and I have a batman one, but you can't put complications on them
[00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:30.240]   So I almost never use them because such a reduction in functionality
[00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:34.000]   So even just letting me put a custom photo there and having robust custom
[00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:40.320]   Complications of port would be great. Well and I have to admit that I would probably clutter mine up a lot and that would be anti apple or whatever
[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:45.520]   But but it would just there's a lot of things I want a data I want and the one thing I can't find is a single watch face
[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:49.360]   That gives you a digital readout with seconds. So there's always yeah, they need that badly
[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:55.840]   You know, it's just like so you have to have a you know your animal your quote unquote analog thing to see the second hands
[00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:59.120]   It's just but there's no digital seconds anywhere and I
[00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:02.000]   For what I do it
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   Seconds are important. It'd be nice. Yeah
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:09.840]   Uh, let's take a break come back. I do want to talk about iOS 9.3
[00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:13.520]   Uh, some interesting revelations there we can continue to talk about what watch
[00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:16.720]   The second apple watch might hold and what the march
[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:24.640]   Uh, I'm kind of curious whether I should uh, I'm thinking maybe I need a new mac laptop. I don't know wait wait. Yeah, maybe
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:27.200]   uh, target
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:36.240]   And he and I co Renee richy Alex linsey we're talking mac with the three of the best in the business
[00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:38.000]   We'll have more in just a minute for you
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.840]   But first a word from fresh books the small business accounting software
[00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:47.600]   Designed for you the freelancer the non-account the person who just wants to run your business
[00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:49.760]   and hates that
[00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:54.000]   that part of the business that uh is frankly required to make money that
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   Getting all the expenses the receipts together getting uh the formatting and sending the invoice
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:04.160]   bothering clients who neglects to pay those are the kinds of things that make
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:06.800]   Your business less fun
[00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:11.200]   Fresh book says let us do it for you and when I started using them and it's now but 10 years
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:14.160]   Amber macarthur told me about it when I was in a lot of pain
[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:18.800]   Suffering through making those invoices at the end of every month and she told me about fresh books
[00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:25.440]   And I started using it. What a revelation. I mean it makes it so easy to create and send professional looking invoices
[00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:30.160]   You could do it via email. Although uh, I don't know that's that's important these days
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:31.360]   I think clients
[00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:36.480]   Understand email in 2004. I often had to have them print out and mail it
[00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:38.560]   Uh, but I did they can do that too
[00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:44.560]   The invoices look great. You'll know when your client has seen it so that old excuse. Oh, I didn't get it
[00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:45.840]   Mm-hmm
[00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:49.680]   You can accept credit cards all sorts of online payment methods on your invoices
[00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:54.960]   That means the clients more likely to pay faster. In fact fresh books says on the order of five days faster
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:28:01.440]   Than they would otherwise they always add new features too. They've just added their new card reader
[00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:08.080]   That means you can accept credit cards if you're in the trade and you know or you come to people's homes and you do home services
[00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:10.400]   the ability to
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:16.640]   Show them the invoice and then have them swipe their credit card or if they have a pin credit card
[00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:19.440]   Dip the chip is awesome
[00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:27.200]   Fresh books really has made it easy for you to get your work done and get the paperwork the accounting out of the way
[00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:31.120]   Their newly redesigned iphone app just came out. In fact, thank you. I noticed apple
[00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:34.560]   Just put the fresh books iphone and the ipad app
[00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:37.840]   On their new and recommended page. That's nice
[00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:44.160]   It means you can conduct business anywhere set an estimate right after a handshake set an invoice and seconds right on your phone
[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:46.560]   Track your billable time
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:48.560]   Know how long projects really take
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:51.600]   And of course track expenses with the phone's camera
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:55.680]   You can even get paid up front request a deposit in fresh books
[00:28:55.680 --> 00:29:01.200]   No more covering costs out of pocket or waiting till the end of the project to get paid fresh books is so

[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:38.160]   We're talking about apple on mac break weekly
[00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:41.280]   Here's one from jason. He says a
[00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:45.200]   Talking about watches a swiss watchmaker
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   Is now making an apple watch
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:53.680]   with a 25,000 mechanical imitation
[00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:56.640]   The same shape as an apple watch, but yeah
[00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:59.680]   Swiss i have an apple watch
[00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:01.680]   It only cost me twice as much
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:06.720]   It's funny. There was a picture of steve jobs that was going around this week where you see steve watch steve jobs wearing a watch
[00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:12.240]   And exactly the same shape. Oh interesting. It is one of the it's like a classic shape. It is a classic shape
[00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:15.280]   Yeah, this is uh, they call this the swiss alp watch
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.800]   Over 200 years of rnd although it was really mostly the last year that made them pickest
[00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:28.400]   You can't take the slugs out though. What's kind of cool is that you can turn it over and you can see the mechanical part working
[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:34.320]   Now so you're saying that is this a copy or it's just I think this is uh home ours
[00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:37.200]   He did this sort of like yeah as a as a way to get attention
[00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:43.280]   And I think they're pretty transparent about that. Okay 25,000 dollars from h mozer and company
[00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:45.840]   And hodinky
[00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:51.760]   Our friend kevin roses new company says it you can buy one of the 50 pieces they're making
[00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:54.800]   There are only 50
[00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:57.280]   It's really no sketches no heartbeats
[00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:02.000]   So it's all the uh
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.480]   All the looks of the apple watch are that any of the benefits
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:07.440]   It's such a different world here when we got the hermez apple watches
[00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:12.560]   Uh, we went and double checked the hermez site just to see what the difference was in cost and the doublator apple watch
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:18.800]   Is a thousand dollars a doublator hermez watch which just has what it doesn't just have but it has a mechanical watch on it is 3000
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:20.000]   Oh
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:27.440]   So the cost of the real hermez stuff or the classical hermez stuff is is three or four times what the apple watch hermez stuff this is
[00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:34.320]   Yeah, the world the classic difference will leave all the kick you in the nuts three times or i'll kick you in the nuts once
[00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:38.720]   Your choice and there and there's some consumers by god. He's only gonna kick
[00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:41.440]   He's gonna kick me in the nuts one third as often as that other guy
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:45.040]   That's why I invested their mezal ecosystem
[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:49.280]   Um
[00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:56.800]   What do they say 11 million users of apple music that's paid over lemon that's paid subscribers
[00:31:56.800 --> 00:32:01.840]   I did they say whether it was paid subscribers. Oh, they didn't
[00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:06.480]   They said subscribers. Yeah, so probably that does mean paid
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:13.280]   Well, you could be I guess uh if you're doing this still doing the three month trial you'd be a subscriber
[00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:20.880]   Or no, I didn't I I read that and I didn't see where that number came from it's still it's still a
[00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:26.080]   A significant number of listeners. Oh, so it didn't come from apple
[00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:29.280]   Was someone familiar with the numbers?
[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:30.720]   Oh lord
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:35.120]   All right. Well, it's a financial times article. So I can't read it, but it's at 10 million
[00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:40.080]   Subscribers would that be now the financial time said well?
[00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:45.440]   It took Spotify more than six years to reach that number, but that was a few years ago. Yeah, it's a bigger market
[00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:49.680]   It's a very different way. It's built right into the iPhone. Yeah, but is 10 million
[00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:54.960]   I figured if it really is 10 million paying subscribers, that's that's pretty good for apple
[00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:57.760]   That's a hundred million dollars a month
[00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:02.640]   Numbers can do whatever you want. We like 10 million sounds like a great number then you say oh, there's almost a billion devices
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:06.960]   So 10 million is small but they'll say oh, it's looking competitor six years to get there. So 10 million is big
[00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:14.000]   Well considering the beats started with 113,000 subscribers when they bought it. I think 10 million is not bad
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:18.720]   But it's what you would expect I guess because it's an apple right and I think that apple needs to
[00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:24.720]   Um, you know number one is I think things like the exclusive with taylor swift will continue to increase it if they find the right
[00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:26.320]   verticals to do that
[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:30.880]   Whether it's live streams or vod or lots of things like that where it's subscriber only
[00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:34.240]   I think that that's going to be a way for them to do big pushes and
[00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:37.280]   In a way that I think that is very difficult for some of the other
[00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:43.520]   Services to do also. I think apple doesn't need to look for not those funky little balls that start up when you
[00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:47.840]   That may be crazy. Um, but but the but finding like a
[00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:53.600]   Sticky things that are going to get you to use the app and I think there's a lot of little things
[00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:56.000]   They could do to the user interface into the experience that would
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.640]   That are unique to this experience and also make it sticky in a way that once you start doing it
[00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:04.640]   You're not going to want to leave and um, I think that's the kind of thing and they need to look for
[00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:08.000]   Uh
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.680]   Apple me go ahead
[00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:15.920]   They are in a lovely situation in which they will it take it will take them two or three years before apple music can possibly fail
[00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:19.200]   So that's a lot of time to see how people are using it
[00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:24.240]   Makes course corrections or just make a make a plan that would take a year or two to execute
[00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:29.600]   So it's not it's not like a startup where the you got people blowing down your snorkel almost immediately about
[00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:31.520]   Ability in the future
[00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:36.800]   Well, and I think that also I think that it is one of those things that I think it would take apple 10 years before they gave up on it because
[00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:41.840]   It would look too bad, you know, so it would really and I and I don't think it at 11 million
[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:45.280]   You know and and I think in three years they'll probably have 20 or 30 million
[00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:50.800]   Uh, you know, I think that that's going to be a number that is sizable and and a reasonable number to just keep keep the business going
[00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:53.120]   My son
[00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:57.200]   If you if you don't think that apple is big enough that projects can simply hide and survive
[00:34:57.600 --> 00:35:02.320]   I urge you to whatever app you're in right now go into the application menu the title the application
[00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:08.320]   Activated and see that little things called services. It's a it's a drop. It's a pull-up menu and it's still there
[00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:13.760]   Even though nobody even though it's an idea that's 10 years old that people stopped being excited about eight years ago
[00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:19.760]   Yeah, I I really like the services. I wish they had to keep that going actually. Yeah, it's like apple. It's like apple script
[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:24.960]   An automator. Yeah absolutely wonderful. Uh, they just need some but nobody nobody supports it
[00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:29.840]   Let me put say the people people who I mean I use automator and uh an apple script all the time. Do you?
[00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:35.920]   Uh, yeah, well because it's like it's it's the it's the ability to automators the ability to
[00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:39.760]   Have an intern that will do something stupid and tedious for you
[00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:44.320]   Only there are no labor practice laws limiting what you can make this intern do
[00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:49.920]   I want and if you talk to most most new Mac users if they even know either of those exist
[00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:55.760]   Probably I haven't I haven't I haven't done I've never I haven't been training in like decades
[00:35:55.760 --> 00:36:01.920]   But there are times where I would speak to use a group or something or or for fun like do like sort of an intro Mac sort of thing
[00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:05.920]   Like even on the on those geek cruises we used to do right and my god
[00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:08.400]   But every time I talk about apple script or automator
[00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:13.760]   I would spend the first 15 minutes just putting on what I call a magic show right just starting from scratch
[00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:16.160]   And what building but
[00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:22.160]   You've sometimes seen developers write apps in front of you and they're just showing off because you can't do that yourself
[00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:28.320]   But it's like I'm gonna step by step. I'm going to build a tool that automatically keeps an eye on this web page
[00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:33.280]   But occasionally the person who runs this will announce that something is available
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:38.160]   And it will keep an eye on this web page and let me know whenever this web page changes and send me an email
[00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:42.400]   whenever it does so I know that this is the time to order order concert tickets and
[00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:48.000]   Four minutes later steps that people can understand now. I have an automator action. That's right there gets
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.320]   I guess I use it all the time for stuff like that. I just wish that I think well
[00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:55.840]   And I think while a lot of new users don't use it
[00:36:55.840 --> 00:37:01.040]   I think there are a lot of power users that would be extremely upset if they didn't have access to it
[00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:03.840]   You know, I think that there's you know, especially when you talk about professionals that are using
[00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:06.480]   Macs and so on so forth in print
[00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:09.760]   in a lot of other things where you know that automation is
[00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:13.440]   Is key to the operate, you know key to making this all work
[00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:17.200]   I mean and a lot of a lot of them have been using it since apple script, you know, uh,
[00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:21.280]   I mean we were using apple script in you know the 90s to
[00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:26.480]   Sal used to tell us that they can never take this out because so many
[00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:30.640]   Publications and others. Yeah have workflows built on automator
[00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:35.920]   I'm talking about it all day, you know, I'm just so I haven't launched automated in ages and it looks good
[00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:40.560]   I have to say but in the automator menu, there's the display automator website
[00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:47.360]   Link which takes you not to an apple site, but but to a site hosted by somebody else
[00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:52.880]   Uh, mac os 10 automation.com. I don't know if this is sal's
[00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:55.120]   Is that sal site?
[00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:57.280]   But they have to say this is not hosted by apple
[00:37:57.280 --> 00:38:00.560]   And that's just I think in some ways shows you that automator
[00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:06.320]   Is really is you know kind of a redhead step child now because if in the automator
[00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:08.240]   menu
[00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:12.080]   Display automator website you'd assume that means that's an apple website. It isn't
[00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:15.120]   That is bizarre
[00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:19.040]   It just shows you that they they continue to include it, but they don't there's no love
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:23.360]   I wouldn't be surprised if sal did that so that he just didn't have to go through
[00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:26.320]   a proof process
[00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:29.200]   Didn't tell anybody
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:34.960]   We heard every on leo. I think that that site will be gone. Whoops never mind
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.880]   Never mind sal who I don't know what you're talking about
[00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:45.600]   Yeah, exactly, but it is a great one for giving lectures where you can really impress people. Did you know your mac can do this?
[00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:52.640]   Back to apple music. I was going to tell a little anecdote because I had mentioned I wanted to be fair that uh, when apple music came out
[00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:54.560]   I talked to my kids
[00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:57.680]   abby 24 and uh henry 21 I said
[00:38:57.680 --> 00:39:02.160]   What if we just got the family account we all had and they said no, we like spotify
[00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:07.280]   And then I got henry's off to bar cilona for a semester and he bought apple music
[00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:10.480]   And though that's interesting
[00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:12.080]   um
[00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:14.480]   For some reason his tone has changed
[00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:19.360]   Well, I think the the one the one killer app piece of apple music that that I mean because I still
[00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:21.760]   Kind of go back and forth between them both of them
[00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:27.680]   I'm trying to get used to apple music and and I but I have so many lists on spotify and I haven't really figured out how to get them all
[00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:34.560]   back and forth and and uh the one thing that the killer has just been able to hold down syria while you're while you're walking and just
[00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:39.760]   Asked syria to play some song that is a killer and it's just like you're just like oh, that is a killer for me
[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:44.720]   That's just worth the subscription because I can see they're driving. I mean, okay, syria play david boe
[00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:48.560]   You know, you know and and it just starts, you know plays, you know and and and that's
[00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:53.200]   I mean when you think about all the things we've gone to to get to that point where we had
[00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:57.600]   You had records you put them on tape and then you have to find the tape and then you have this thing and then we had
[00:39:57.600 --> 00:39:59.760]   They have napster and then we had to have you know
[00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:03.520]   We had to buy the songs and now we're to a point where for a subscription fee
[00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:09.360]   I can listen to almost any song I can imagine by just asking syria to play it for me. It's pretty impressive
[00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:11.840]   Yeah, you can play roger woulda good right before mac break week
[00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:20.800]   By the way audience we're we're not apologizing to all of you whose computers just started playing gave it boe music
[00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:24.560]   That we are good. We're gonna say you're welcome for that
[00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:29.200]   What's that poster that poster behind you is a david boe at tribute, isn't it?
[00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:34.880]   Yeah, well, that's that's a poster from uh mac world expo 1994
[00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:36.800]   uh
[00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:38.800]   He did an album and and
[00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:41.840]   multimedia experience and he teamed up with a company called iON
[00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:46.640]   It was a multimedia CD rom if you can remember what those were called jump interactive
[00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:52.720]   He was not at mac world expo if he were then you i'd be telling you all about the pictures that I got and how
[00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:57.520]   It took them 12 minutes to unclamp me from his lower leg to prevent him walking with me
[00:40:57.520 --> 00:41:02.000]   Uh, but these were these were signs that were like stapled like regular concert posters
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.720]   Printed by a regular concert poster company that was stapled up
[00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:07.520]   At a wall like just outside mauscony
[00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:11.200]   And I just walked up to one and I pulled one down and I walked off of it
[00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:15.520]   Assuming that they wouldn't have hung those in a public place if they did not intend
[00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:17.840]   People to simply steal them
[00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:22.880]   And and I I walked as I I wrote a blog post about this say that I walked right away
[00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:30.240]   Just in case there was somebody following behind me from management of iON or mac world expo to just dissuade me of my
[00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:32.640]   Idea that these were meant to be taken away
[00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:36.640]   Uh, and this has been on my office wall for 20 years
[00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:39.360]   Yeah, I see it's the exact like I said
[00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:44.720]   I say on my blog the exact intersection of two of the biggest influences of my childhood david boe and apple
[00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:50.320]   Yeah, very amazing. He was he was quite technically literate. We yeah, yesterday I played a
[00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:54.960]   Interview that we did on tech tv lem maklim did on internet tonight
[00:41:54.960 --> 00:42:01.200]   Uh with boe into 1999 and he was talking about mp3s and how that was going to change the music industry and the
[00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:04.000]   The only artist who didn't like mp3s were people who
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:10.560]   Were afraid that the people were going to hear their outtakes and it was really interesting. It was uh, he was very prescient
[00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:14.560]   Man who felt earth the man of felt earth. Yep one of our favorites
[00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:16.960]   apple, uh
[00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:18.960]   in the us app store
[00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:23.440]   Uh on apple spotify is the top grossing app in the music category
[00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:29.680]   Yeah, music is not occluded there because it's built in. Yeah on the google play store spotify's
[00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:31.040]   uh
[00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:33.360]   performance hasn't gone down since November 10th
[00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:39.040]   And apple music hasn't been doing that well on android, but you wouldn't expect it to
[00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:41.760]   70th place number of downloads
[00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:47.440]   Uh and spotify's in 12th place. Don't know if that's significant. I don't yeah exactly
[00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:48.640]   I don't know how much to read into that
[00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:53.360]   It's uh one of the things that's in the back of my mind is how much of apple music success
[00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:58.480]   Whatever turns out to be is going to be simply that it's preloaded on everything and no one has to
[00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:03.280]   Uh, it's the it's the easiest way to get subscription music on an iphone by far
[00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:07.440]   The same reason why apple maps is the easiest map service and safari
[00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:10.960]   Is the easiest version of a web browser to run on this thing
[00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:15.840]   Uh, so it's going to take a while to really understand where they're having the serious success
[00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:24.640]   Uh with where are they making people happiest with apple music and what feature if they added or changed would totally change experience for somebody else
[00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:29.040]   Because there's going to be that certain percentage of people that used it because it was right there
[00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:31.360]   It wasn't so bad that
[00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:34.880]   Uh, they stop using it and none of the other services are so good
[00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:37.280]   Uh that it was worth them changing
[00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:44.240]   Well, whatever music system you're listening to you probably not going to be listening to it on headphones with the new iphone
[00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:50.640]   There's a segue on 3.5 millimeter head. Yeah, you'll yeah, they'll be headphones of some kind
[00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:57.600]   Fast company says it's true apple will drop the headphone jack more and more people are kind of coming around to this
[00:43:57.600 --> 00:43:59.680]   Now they're saying the supply chain
[00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:06.160]   Is also saying that the uh the new uh iphone seven will not have an uh, and i headphone jack
[00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:13.280]   But just a company that makes the supplier for headphone jack's had to cut uh, their their projections for years going forward leo because no one's buying
[00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:16.640]   Concluding a headphone jack seems conclusive doesn't it?
[00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:21.040]   Um, so let's kind of gear up for this. What are we going to do is apple?
[00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:24.400]   Well, I guess the really interesting question is what is apple going to do?
[00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:29.920]   Are they going to put headphones in the new iphone seven that connect to the lightning port or will they be wireless or what?
[00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:31.440]   Wireless will be an upsell
[00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:37.040]   I mean if apple if we could project future behavior based on past behavior and apple has had apple branded wireless headphones
[00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:41.360]   For a while that they haven't released I thought they would release some with the apple watch but they didn't but a
[00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:45.040]   Typical apple would be putting the the lightning headphones in the box
[00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:49.360]   Uh for people who really want that experience and then offering a premium sort of wireless headphone
[00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:53.440]   Uh the way they do the in here headphones right now is sort of like the next tier up
[00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:59.120]   And then they own beats they happen to own beats and they can put a whole line of beats with lightning adapters or plugs
[00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:04.320]   They're actually already are I think and the apple sells an app a set of audis headphones for $800
[00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:06.000]   So they're lightning
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:11.040]   Uh basically and I think that this I think this this of course makes it thinner and provides more space for battery
[00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:17.040]   But I think it's also important that it closes off the last non, you know licensed connection to the phone
[00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:21.840]   So, you know, I think that that that has a big, you know, uh, you know, there's a lot of us that have hacked
[00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:25.600]   Solutions and don't look at square doesn't square use the headphone jack your lungs
[00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:30.960]   There are a lot of data acquisition and capture devices that that uses it
[00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:33.440]   I have a thermometer that uses the headphone jack
[00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:35.040]   Don't need an mfi license to use it
[00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:39.520]   But the other thing that it like it it probably won't make it thinner because lightning is not that thin a collection
[00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:43.360]   iPod touch is already super thin and a lot of android phones are super thin even with
[00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:47.760]   Jax and battery I mean they they took out battery to put in 3d touch last time
[00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:51.120]   But what it does do is if you look at the phone design now the bottom bezel
[00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:52.160]   Um
[00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:55.920]   It's pretty large and they can afford to have a headphone jack there if you start removing that bezel
[00:45:56.080 --> 00:45:59.760]   That headphone jack has to go underneath the screen and then that creates other engineering problems
[00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:05.200]   So I think about what really does want to make the casing smaller this year or in two years from now and getting rid of the headphone jack
[00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:09.760]   One of the steps to get me. Let me ask you this lightning. Does it have analog audio out of the lightning port?
[00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:11.680]   Is it only digital audio? It's pure digital
[00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:19.200]   So that means that the digital to analog converter the DAC will no longer have to be in the iPhone
[00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:25.040]   That saves space as well, but it will be in the headphones. You'll have to have a DAC in the headphones
[00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:28.040]   Yeah, apple could build it in or they could leave it for external
[00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:33.120]   Manufacturers, I'm not sure which way they would go yet. It might it might be very drastic step to limit it completely
[00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:35.440]   If you're going to have lightning connector headphones
[00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:38.240]   You will have to have you will only be getting bits
[00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:42.880]   So you'll have to have something that convinced can converts to analog so you can hear them
[00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:43.680]   Yes, true
[00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:47.200]   That's going to add to the cost of the headphones because you have to put a chip in there now
[00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:50.320]   I don't know maybe maybe they figured out it doesn't add that much to the cost
[00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:56.640]   There's a lot of potential though on the upside for audio files because now you could put a better DAC
[00:46:56.640 --> 00:47:00.160]   On there that would be better quality could play back for instance
[00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:07.040]   High res music that's just out of apples hands now apple doesn't have to worry about it apple watch hasn't ship without a headset jack
[00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:09.360]   It was one of what I would be in this
[00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:13.120]   No, but I would be surprised we saw something that was that was a like the bows
[00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:18.320]   Um, you know like the bows thing when you have like a little rectangle that they're using you know on the on the little
[00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:24.240]   Have to if you wanted to use standard analog headphones, you'd have to have an a converter. They included a DAC
[00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:26.000]   Right
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:29.280]   That wouldn't have been understand that you could put you could have one there that's giving you really
[00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:34.960]   I think there is is doing north cancellation and apple could build the noise cancellation in at least so they'd be taking one thing away and giving you something else
[00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:38.400]   The tax can't be that bigger expensive because things like the braggy
[00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:41.760]   Dash which is an in-ear bluetooth
[00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:46.880]   Headphones very small doesn't have you know, it has five hours battery life just from that
[00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:52.880]   Uh, there's a DAC in that so it can't be that can't be that yeah, it wouldn't it wouldn't be that much bigger
[00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:56.960]   Uh, I mean if you've ever seen a tear down actually of a like no the license light and cable
[00:47:56.960 --> 00:48:02.160]   You will actually see there's actually a there's an interesting computer inside the end of that connector
[00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:05.360]   what what I would have been thinking about though is that um
[00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:10.080]   Apple I feel as though apple would absolutely
[00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:15.600]   Half when they introduce if they were to introduce an iPhone without a headphone jack
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:21.760]   They would have to say here is what we're giving you the consumer in exchange
[00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:27.200]   Here's the big upgrade that we're giving you by by taking out that headphone jack
[00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:28.480]   You're welcome
[00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:31.200]   Uh, because if they say if they only say that well
[00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:34.480]   We were able to save ourselves some manufacturing costs
[00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:38.320]   We were able to limit the size of the bezel which we wanted and we were able to make a little bit
[00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:43.920]   The flatter and also it makes it gives us a little less trouble trying to fit all the components inside there
[00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:48.880]   Nobody who is even marginally aware of how successful apple is going to be is going to say well
[00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:51.920]   You've just screwed me over for every pair of headphones that I have
[00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:55.200]   Uh, but i'm glad that you've made things more convenient for you
[00:48:55.200 --> 00:49:01.280]   So they would have to find uh, they would have to find some way to sell it so that it so that they can say here's why
[00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:05.360]   We did it for you not for us for you and I don't know if
[00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:14.160]   Improved audio is going to do it because a mass majority of people are perfectly fine with whatever analog headphones that they have
[00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:19.280]   There you are you already can't sell people on the most exquisite studio production
[00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:22.800]   of a of a completely high bit rate
[00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:25.120]   proprietary album format
[00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:30.640]   I don't think anybody can really sense that one thing that is at least possible is that they could say that
[00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:36.560]   Because of the way that the lightning connector is created we can make it more water resistant
[00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:39.040]   It will be one less point of entry
[00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:43.120]   Um, I was thinking about that and trying to look at that late last week
[00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:48.960]   Um, and I'm not convinced that they couldn't get the exact same sort of solution with a better
[00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:54.080]   Headphone jack and as is a lot of the flagship phones that we have
[00:49:54.080 --> 00:50:00.480]   Uh, they don't want to go so far as to say that this has been certified as being waterproof or weather resistant
[00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:03.280]   But nonetheless you can find no shortage of people who
[00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:06.320]   Uh took like an exes 5x and actually
[00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:12.080]   Started music playing and put it under put it in a bowl of clear water and three hours later
[00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:15.120]   It was still running perfectly fine. Uh, so I'm
[00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:22.240]   This isn't a prediction of how they're going to sell it, but I really am stumped for how they could pull this off and not
[00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:28.400]   Be saying that this is something we did for our own convenience. We're kind of screwing you right in the neck
[00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:30.400]   But hey by
[00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:32.960]   One of the things in the back of your mind or back in my mind
[00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:37.760]   Sometimes is that the knowledge that apple is the only manufacturer of iphones
[00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:43.280]   And the suspicion that every single conversation that they have about a new design is yes
[00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:45.920]   This is going might include the phrase. Yes. This is going to
[00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:49.600]   Inconvenience and steam off a lot of different a lot of our customers
[00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:54.640]   But will they get so angry that they'll switch to android probably no great? So let's go ahead and do it. Yeah
[00:50:54.640 --> 00:51:00.160]   And jim dar bah could take on this and he you know, he he had his he's had his problems with apple music
[00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:03.920]   But he his take at least the way I read it was sort of like and he's got high-end headphones
[00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:07.360]   He was telling us all about his high-end headphones last time that he couldn't wait to get rid of them
[00:51:07.360 --> 00:51:10.560]   And he thought that he would get substantially better audio and I realized that is a niche
[00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:13.920]   But there are going to be people who the jack the headphone jack
[00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:17.680]   I just bought the high-end headphones with the head phone jack he recommended by the way
[00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:20.880]   I know and he's already throwing if might be a scott born when they first announced the iphone
[00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:22.880]   He started jumping on his trio
[00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:27.040]   Sort of like looking forward to the future and sort of things you can get out of them
[00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:31.360]   Yeah, but you can you can have both of those jacks you can still have that super high-end audio through lightning
[00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:36.000]   But still have the headphone jack. I just i'm an adapter too. I mean, it's a dongle, but it's a no
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:38.800]   That adapter adapter that's the way they saw that
[00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:44.080]   I'm saying that if any argument here the answer is oh people just get an adapter
[00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:46.640]   That is so non-apple
[00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:50.880]   Excuse me, there's an aspirational aspect to how we see apple
[00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:55.760]   And if apple says that you'll expect lots of people to go out and buy dongles
[00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:59.040]   As opposed to remember years ago when the interest the iMac
[00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:02.560]   They were saying they were saying that we're switching we're no longer using adb
[00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:08.640]   We're now going to use usb for everything they were able to easily say but this is a industry standard
[00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:10.880]   You can buy any keyboard and any mouse and use it with it
[00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:12.960]   This is where the future is going to be
[00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:15.600]   We know it's going to be really a hardship for the first couple years
[00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:19.760]   But eventually the entire industry is going to be using usb not only for keyboards
[00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:24.160]   But also for mass storage trust us you're going to be so much happier with this a year or two from now
[00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:26.880]   I'm trying to figure out what what tail no
[00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:31.040]   Huge backlash on this huge backlash. Yeah, I mean, I do
[00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:34.640]   I definitely think there's going to be a big backlash. I think that
[00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:38.800]   I think what's interesting also though is I wonder if apple is
[00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:44.160]   Is looking at number one controlling the entire ecosystem, but also
[00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:49.040]   What if if 90 percent of the people who buy high-end headphones are
[00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:54.400]   Are only you know iPhone users? Let's say I mean which is quite possible
[00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:59.040]   Uh, do you end up in a situation where these manufacturers stop making?
[00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:04.800]   You know, it's not making the regular headphones because uh, there's just not worth having to you know
[00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:09.600]   It's like there's two parts of that that's really interesting and one is when apple switched from the dock connector to lightning
[00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:12.800]   They did make adapters, but they did not get them into stores in time for launch
[00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:15.040]   It took a week or two and that was the worst part
[00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:18.400]   I mean if you're going to switch a connector on people you have an absolute responsibility
[00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:22.000]   Because those adapters available immediately, especially if you don't put one in the box
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:25.120]   Because someone buying the new device having the new cable losing or damaging their cable
[00:53:25.120 --> 00:53:27.200]   They suddenly cannot use that device
[00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:30.640]   Uh, so if they do have adapters available, they have to get them to market
[00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:35.280]   But the other thing was uh, to Andy's point some people were saying if they're going to do this then do it with usbc
[00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:38.720]   Because then you can make the argument that it'll work with anything across any range of device
[00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:44.720]   And don't do it with lightning although it's finally here whether usbc does everything that apple wants lightning to go
[00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:48.480]   And also they don't have control of it. I mean, I just don't think I mean I thought for a long time
[00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:52.640]   Like I kept on thinking the next iPhone is going to have usbc and then the more I thought about it
[00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:56.880]   I just think that that puts them in a situation where they don't really control their ecosystem
[00:53:56.960 --> 00:54:00.480]   And I think the iPhone is too important. I think that's part of it is getting rid of all this
[00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:03.600]   I think really has to do with controlling everything that contacts the phone
[00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:06.640]   But what a terrible terrible reason to do that though
[00:54:06.640 --> 00:54:12.240]   I'm like I said there there has there has to be I don't care how much any manufacturer or software maker
[00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:16.720]   Disrupts the lives of the users so long as they can make the absolutely sincere
[00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:21.280]   Incredible argument that we made this really really horrible change because we know that a year
[00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:25.040]   We have to make this change basically to make sure there's a product you're going to continue to want to use
[00:54:25.360 --> 00:54:28.000]   Over the next two or three years. I am absolutely
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:32.880]   Deaf to the argument that we wanted to make things a little bit thinner or we wanted to make
[00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:38.880]   We wanted to knock an extra 82 cents off of our cost to manufacture because something it and I don't think that there's a
[00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:45.200]   I don't think I know that rene wasn't saying that there was an equivalency between deleting the
[00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:51.040]   deleting the the audio port and changing the 30 pin to the lightning dock connector
[00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:55.200]   But to that general point, I just don't think that it's a
[00:54:55.200 --> 00:55:00.000]   Headphones have been unchanged for the past what 30 years century
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:03.760]   And then it's that's what I'm getting at is that
[00:55:03.760 --> 00:55:12.720]   This is not and the thing is nobody has delivered an upgrade to headphones yet that justified a totally new digital
[00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:16.720]   Port it has to be stereo and it has to deliver good audio
[00:55:17.360 --> 00:55:22.160]   And given that you're wearing headphones at the bus while waiting for a bus while going for a walk
[00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:25.520]   I'm not like sitting in an anechoic chamber with headphones on
[00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:32.480]   Uh, it's it's such a bad thing to try to disrupt somebody's life that bad to give an
[00:55:32.480 --> 00:55:36.400]   Infinite does some and probably impossible to sense
[00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:40.960]   Improvement and audio quality that I don't think that I think the argument
[00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:42.880]   I think
[00:55:42.880 --> 00:55:47.840]   Possibly the argument there and I I agree with you a lot of I mean if it becomes only because they're trying to control it
[00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:48.880]   I think it's a really bad idea
[00:55:48.880 --> 00:55:50.000]   I think that
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:51.920]   Trying to think about what they would do it, you know
[00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:54.400]   It's part of it is is that if you have the connector
[00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:58.400]   And if you force the industry to go down that path where you support that connector
[00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:03.200]   What if you're taking biometric readings all these other things that you could add that are going to be hard to reach critical mass
[00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:05.680]   If you don't get rid of the other option
[00:56:05.680 --> 00:56:09.760]   You know that you know that might be you know part of the part of the thought process
[00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:13.520]   But you know I agree they I definitely agree with you that they have to come up with a
[00:56:13.520 --> 00:56:18.880]   Very very solid, you know reason and a lot of upside to make it worth getting rid of it
[00:56:18.880 --> 00:56:22.720]   But we now know they are right. I mean it's safe to say they are
[00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:27.520]   They've been doing experimenting with it for a while, but this year feels like the year where it that that model finally
[00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:32.640]   Just that one thing that's it a supply chain thing. I mean that confirms it. I think
[00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:37.360]   Well, I'll I'll say in that I actually I've been answering this question a lot over the past couple of weeks
[00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:42.880]   If app if the iPhone 7 were going to have no no traditional headphone jack
[00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:50.720]   In january of that year I would expect to hear the type and velocity of rumors that i'm hearing right now
[00:56:50.720 --> 00:56:53.440]   Yeah, so I don't know if I don't I've still won't say that
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:58.800]   Anything is a lock until it's a and things can change like sapphire screens even at the last minute again
[00:56:58.800 --> 00:57:03.280]   Like like when I keep saying apple builds a lot of things and you'd be surprised at how late in the game
[00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:06.560]   They get before they really absolutely commit to one design over another
[00:57:06.560 --> 00:57:11.520]   So it's possible that they really are that far along but there's still a lot of really loud arguments
[00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:16.480]   One's in happening inside one in fit loop about what direction to go whether if they're going to do it
[00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:19.120]   Should they do it in 2016 or should they wait till 2017
[00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:22.240]   For a second I do it eventually right like in 50 years and we're doing the show
[00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:28.480]   We won't have a light any part anymore. Can we get when when human ears have evolved to the point where they they're like more tubular and come to
[00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:31.200]   Points and they're forced to redesign it anyway. Yes
[00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:39.120]   These are the speakers they sell at the apple store the oddies which oddies are very high-end audio file headphones
[00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:46.320]   These are $800 the eLA titanium's by the way they can be used for voice calls as well
[00:57:46.320 --> 00:57:48.000]   um
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:53.440]   And uh, the the selling point on these is stunning 24-bit
[00:57:53.440 --> 00:57:56.160]   Audio because they have their built-in
[00:57:56.160 --> 00:58:01.600]   Tips leo or is it only lightning or can you swap the uh, that's an interesting question
[00:58:01.600 --> 00:58:08.080]   That's the interesting thing because if you look at apples devices lightning is everything the magic stuff charges on lightning the pencil charges on lightning
[00:58:08.080 --> 00:58:13.360]   Uh except for the apple tv and the macbook and the macbook makes sense because lives in a pc world in the apple tv
[00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:17.280]   I'm not quite sure why it's usb instead of lightning unless there's data advantages
[00:58:17.360 --> 00:58:21.760]   But this does only for manufacturers this does have an adapter that'll get you to
[00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:24.160]   To a stereo
[00:58:24.160 --> 00:58:27.680]   Headphone a phono jack or I don't know if it'll get you to mini jack
[00:58:27.680 --> 00:58:32.720]   But it'll get you to phono jack because if you pay $800 for these you really want to listen to one your stereo too
[00:58:32.720 --> 00:58:37.040]   Right. That is a lot of people listening to your music for you at that amount of money
[00:58:37.040 --> 00:58:40.080]   No, uh, wow
[00:58:40.080 --> 00:58:45.200]   But so and I don't think so that's the point is I don't think the audio file community is going to not like this effect
[00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:47.440]   They're probably a proof of it because
[00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:52.000]   Those are two groups consumers will just throw like they they're disposable almost you get one with your new iPhone
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:54.560]   And if you lose it you get the next one has lightning they may not even notice
[00:58:54.560 --> 00:58:58.480]   They're sort of that huge range of people who who care enough about them
[00:58:58.480 --> 00:59:01.440]   But not enough that they'll see this as an advantage that will get most effective
[00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:07.680]   Like but that's the argument apple has to include lightning headphones in the box. Okay. They can't stiff you
[00:59:07.680 --> 00:59:09.920]   They have to do the lightning headphones
[00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:13.200]   The problem is that it really is a headphones are almost a consumable
[00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:16.320]   I mean you lose them you burn them through the wash you break them
[00:59:16.320 --> 00:59:20.560]   Uh, and so people I would be also interested to see
[00:59:20.560 --> 00:59:28.800]   What the price of a pair of cheap apple branded lightning headphones would be so once I do realize it
[00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:32.000]   Damn it. I left my headphone right back. I'll get another dis another
[00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:32.960]   Can you go to another?
[00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:36.800]   Can you go to the 7-11 or the gas station and get your kids another
[00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:41.760]   But even if like if it costs me $40 to replace them at the apple store
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:46.720]   Right that I would be I would feel so horked off and then when it comes time to buy an iPhone 8
[00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:52.800]   I would be saying let's see who else is making well and if you've invested as I just did thank you jim daller
[00:59:52.800 --> 00:59:54.800]   Pulling in you know $200
[00:59:54.800 --> 00:59:58.640]   Mini jack headphones. I guess one answer would be to get a
[00:59:58.640 --> 01:00:00.960]   convertible
[01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:03.520]   uh converter that will take it to from lightning to
[01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:09.680]   Did that when we had those when they when they had uh, what was it that on the original iPhone the first one or two
[01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:13.680]   versions where they had that curve that meant that you couldn't use it so you had to have it
[01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:16.000]   We all had these little
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:21.040]   So we're not okay still like that and that was legitimately embarrassing for apple
[01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:26.640]   We should that should be there if there is a wall of shame for apple design. That's absolutely it
[01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:31.040]   I mean we could be good. Let's let's also let's also put the third possibility on the table
[01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:38.480]   What if apple were to decide to jabsulate go for broke saying that with let's test how hard it is for someone to decide to not buy the next
[01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:44.000]   iPhone what if we were to just to hard wire them in and if you break them you have to buy a whole new iPhone
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.660]   Forget rid of the
[01:00:46.660 --> 01:00:51.760]   No, no such a strain relief either. It'll just be like sort of pushed through a hole in the side and a couple of solder points
[01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:57.680]   Looking to see if mono price or somebody sells a lightning to 3.5 millimeter
[01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:00.000]   It's not the first should you point out that apple is not the first one to do this
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:05.520]   HTC a lot of windows mobile and I think even early android phones only had usb out and you get a little break off really
[01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:11.200]   Box that would plug into it. Yeah, I forget the names. That's all gone now. Isn't it? That's telling that was a flop
[01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:16.320]   It goes in and then you get like a stereo out and you'd get a usb out and and something else
[01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:20.560]   It was the slider phones and I think even one of the early HTC android phones did that
[01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:24.160]   We've been a couple of vendors done in the past. That's that those are real
[01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:28.000]   Outlier sort of designs and as I can't remember the name
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:33.120]   But there are at least one design where the backstory on that was that they screwed up big time
[01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:37.280]   And they figured the only way that they could make their ship date was to put everything across the usb bus
[01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:44.320]   And it was and it's back in the days where you're making 800 different models of phone and introducing 30 every month
[01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:46.960]   And the person that was
[01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:52.080]   The story that I heard was that the person who was the head of the design team decided to spend more time with his family after that
[01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:59.360]   And I presume that a lot of companies are gearing up because I don't find any lightning to 3.5 millimeter adapters
[01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:01.680]   Or really an it would be a DAC
[01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:04.640]   So I don't know what the price would be but you know what there are cheap decks out there
[01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:06.640]   They probably could do it for 10 bucks. Yeah
[01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:10.000]   Hello kitty on there everyone's happy. Yeah
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:16.320]   I think would be interesting if apple were to if part of the discussions if apple that apple might would be having is
[01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:19.120]   Let's make sure that the standard is such that
[01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:27.360]   Uh, if someone wants to if monoprice or alibaba sellers want to make a knockoff pair of headphones that just deliver audio
[01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:35.600]   It will be easy to hack this connector so that people can go to the drugstore and buy us at headphones for 10 dollars
[01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:38.160]   Uh, we're not gonna we're not gonna endorse it. We're not gonna promote it
[01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:39.920]   We're not even gonna say to anybody. This is a feature
[01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:45.840]   But we know that there are engineers out there that can take a look at this connector and find out what signal is going over what
[01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:51.760]   Um, and there's enough power coming off lightning to do the uh, DAC. I presume
[01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:53.200]   Yeah
[01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:55.040]   Yeah, I'm not gonna drain the phone. I hope
[01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:56.640]   Yeah
[01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:59.760]   Again, it's it's amazing the amount of I was absolutely
[01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:06.880]   Gops mac when I saw the first teardown of a lightning cable just to see here is how much here is there's the power of the computer
[01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:08.800]   not like the little not the you know
[01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:15.120]   A couple of diodes like here is the computer that's inside the end of this little cable that doesn't look that much bigger
[01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:18.560]   Uh, and here's how and here's how much it has to do
[01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:24.960]   In order to make it do everything that apple wants it to do so I I've no I've no doubt that uh, did you smart team
[01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:28.960]   Yep, sorry. Alex. I stepped on you. What was what did you want to say?
[01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:36.800]   I don't remember. Oh, I'm sorry. I hate it when that happens sure it wasn't important. Yeah, if I forgot it you could get $10
[01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:41.840]   30 pin connector to mini jack so I can't imagine it's gonna be
[01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:44.720]   For that analog audio on it again
[01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:47.840]   I I I think that the uh, I remember what I was gonna say
[01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:50.400]   I think that the the issue with being a non nfi
[01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:53.280]   Mfi where you're gonna hack it and make it work is that
[01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:59.040]   Updates might break your your headphones. You know like that's the you know, I we definitely with non mfi cables
[01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:00.800]   I've definitely had issues where
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:06.560]   Uh, some of my ipads won't see it, you know won't charge with it won't you know, there's all these things that happen
[01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:11.360]   So yeah, you could probably get a cheap one and it'll you'll have the same problem that we have with non mfi right now
[01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:13.440]   Yeah
[01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:15.280]   You can switch it
[01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:21.520]   It'll be pretty disruptive. I was just thinking that one of one of my favorite accessories is just a simple button that plugs into
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.960]   Uh plugs into the headphone jacked as a remote shutter trigger
[01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:28.800]   Uh, and i'm sure that they'll net well wire up the headphones so that the volume buttons
[01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:34.880]   Maybe the selfie sticks are gonna break all over the world blue tooth blue tooth. They'll be safely. Oh, so there's enough
[01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:36.960]   So there's an upside
[01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:39.920]   I just bought a selfie stick with a mini jack
[01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:42.880]   Damn it
[01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:45.040]   There's eight dollars. I'm not getting back
[01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:48.880]   All right, we're gonna take a break 9.3
[01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:53.840]   Is out the first beta and rene richy is going to tell us all about it, right?
[01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:55.920]   Absolutely. All right
[01:04:55.920 --> 01:05:00.240]   By the way, I like serenity callwell's theory completely unsupported by a fact
[01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:04.480]   That what apple will do is the next ipod will be built into the headphones
[01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:06.480]   They'll be beats headphones with an ipod in it
[01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:11.440]   Yeah, well she was thinking that wearable doesn't have to mean watch it doesn't have to mean risk that apple once they have this technology
[01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:15.280]   And now they have a headphones company. They could start putting it in any other place that makes sense
[01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:20.400]   It seems like an obvious why if you want to get if you want to go down market like we have this fancy apple watch
[01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:24.720]   But if you want to compete if you want the ipod shuffle version of the apple watch then that makes a lot of sense
[01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:28.960]   Ladies and gentlemen, I want to introduce you to my favorite shaving
[01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:34.400]   company harries effect. Let me put on little harries after shave right now harries
[01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:38.880]   Is a brilliant idea a company that has reinvented
[01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:41.920]   shaving by
[01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:44.080]   by making it
[01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:46.080]   affordable and easy
[01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:52.720]   They they bought the factory. I haven't used this yet. So it's not prime. Let me prime the pump and get my aftershave. Oh, yeah
[01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:56.000]   Mmm
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:01.760]   What else do we have the daily face wash? But really harries really it all starts with the blades
[01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:05.040]   They bought the factory in germany that makes the best blades in the world
[01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:10.720]   And now they sell them direct to you, which means you save a lot of money. You're going to start with the harries kit
[01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:16.720]   Uh, this is the Truman kit. I believe that's uh, $15. Although we're going to get you five bucks off
[01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:19.840]   So you can get started with harries for little as as 10 bucks
[01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:26.400]   Uh, they come in a variety of colors actually Truman is a really a great idea and uh, make your travel razor
[01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:32.160]   Maybe a Truman and then the true the kit for $10 not just the handle, but three blades
[01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:37.280]   Uh, the travel cover and your choice of harries
[01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:42.800]   Uh foaming shave gel or the cream I use the cream but a lot of people prefer a foaming shave gel
[01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:45.680]   And harries just does it right for about half the cost
[01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:50.240]   Of your drugstore blade you get a great shave
[01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:56.080]   It feels good and when you need new blades, they just come automatically in the mail
[01:06:56.080 --> 01:06:58.560]   by subscription
[01:06:58.560 --> 01:07:04.160]   I love harries you to love harries a great gift for the man in your life or you
[01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:10.160]   If you're the man in your life h a r r y s harries
[01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:17.600]   Dot com and when you get there they do have a lot of extra little stuff you can get as gifts like the the razor stand
[01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:24.960]   And the face wash and their travel kit. There's lots of really great stuff h a r r y s dot com
[01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:29.520]   They give 1% of their sales and 1% of their time back to the communities they serve which is really nice
[01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:34.400]   And uh, man, it just feels so good and it smells so good
[01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:36.640]   I feel like it just came from the barber
[01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:39.520]   And I have my nice harries
[01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:41.200]   She
[01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:47.200]   Harries dot com don't forget to use the off-code mac break to get five dollars off your first order
[01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:50.160]   Harry's
[01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:54.320]   iOS 9.3 beta 1
[01:07:54.320 --> 01:08:02.080]   And now we can talk about it right because we should just reiterate this that apples change their non-disclosure policy
[01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:06.240]   Well, they've they've become like they'll actually they're talking about it themselves. They want you to know
[01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:11.520]   Yeah, and they have a preview up and they have a website up that has a lot of features listed and it's it's really cool
[01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:16.800]   Uh, why is that it's an actual like product information base. Why are they doing that?
[01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:20.000]   Uh, I think it's just part of
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.880]   I hate to call it new apple because apple has always done different things
[01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:26.640]   But it they have features that they're excited about and they want you to know that they're coming
[01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:30.880]   Right and you know, sometimes they want to do surprise and delight and they want to shock you with things you never expected
[01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:36.320]   But they they have to put this out for developers anyway and trying to make sure that nothing leaks out and it's just it's just gave up
[01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:38.400]   Everybody good. This is getting out in front of it
[01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:43.040]   And the thing is this is not a product they sell so I can understand why secrecy is important on products
[01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:48.240]   They sell but this is really something that's coming to an iOS device near you soon
[01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:55.360]   Yes, so why not let people know a little bit when will we get 9.3? This is beta 1 that means we're still pretty early, right?
[01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:58.640]   They haven't said there's typically around six beta's give or take for any
[01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:03.040]   For any release and there's usually about two weeks in between them so late February early March
[01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:06.080]   Oh, maybe around the march event would make sense interesting
[01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:09.680]   Interesting
[01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:13.600]   So really again another piece of evidence that they are going to have a march event
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:17.200]   What tell us about 9.3? What's new in 9.3?
[01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:22.240]   So there's a few things one is night shift and this is sort of people who are familiar with uh f dot l ux flux on
[01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:24.720]   Jailbreak it sort of changes the colors
[01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:31.280]   Georgia has spoken really well about this before but technology especially the screens has an adverse effect on you when you're trying to go to sleep at night
[01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:35.680]   The colors that they shift towards are ones that promote you staying awake, which is the opposite of what you want
[01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:40.240]   So with this iOS will will intelligently modify the spectrum that is providing
[01:09:40.240 --> 01:09:45.440]   Uh at nighttime to sort of put you in a state that's less um agitated more actually kind of brilliant
[01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:47.440]   It's less blue in other words
[01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:50.560]   Yeah, it's not a night theme. Some people thought it was going to be a complete night theme
[01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:55.120]   And you know they probably are working on that but this for now is a night shift the shifts towards the warmer
[01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:58.560]   End of the spectrum from blue to yellow and you know if you're a photographer
[01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:00.960]   You know that blue is daylight is bright light
[01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:08.080]   And uh yellow is uh more evening light and that makes sense that your body is tuned to that light and prepared to wake up
[01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:10.400]   When it sees blue and go to sleep when it sees the yellow
[01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:15.360]   If they if they if they perfect this and really have it so that you get really tired when you're looking at it
[01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:17.360]   Ah, it's gonna be a perfect tool for here
[01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:23.120]   Of hey kids, let's let's have ipad time. It's eight o'clock, you know, and uh, that'd be awesome
[01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:28.000]   This could be it's part of a it's part of a plan where the ipad gets you you're getting sleepy
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000]   You're getting sleepy
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000]   Reorder the new ipad pro 2
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.640]   You just you just have dinner with a little trip to fan
[01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:41.200]   You know, so you look at some milks some turkey and then you and then you hand them the ipad and and there's no argument
[01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:44.880]   They're just they just fall asleep just slumped over the ipad and then just carry them to bed
[01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:47.200]   Perfect the next one is a little more confusing to me
[01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:51.520]   And it's it's basically you can set a password or use touch id for your notes
[01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:57.200]   And this is really cool and it shows some of the advances that apples made with their architecture for things like password protecting and
[01:10:57.200 --> 01:11:00.400]   Uh, and biometric protection, but they're only doing it for notes
[01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:01.760]   So if you type a note
[01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:06.880]   You can then go into options and make that note a secure note that you'd have to retype your default notes password
[01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:10.880]   Which is separate from your device password or use touch id to gain entrance to it
[01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:16.240]   So you can put things like financial information health information website logins if you want to keep those in notes
[01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:19.840]   That's fine sort of like apples version of the one password notes field
[01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:24.000]   Or or or one pass um loads sorry last pass notes field
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:29.760]   But to me like a system wide version this would be great because maybe you want to protect your messages or your photographs
[01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:32.880]   Or any of the other apps that you have on your device
[01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:37.280]   So i'm hopeful that this is a first step towards you being able to flip a switch and making any app
[01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:41.200]   Or any set any data set protected by your passcode or your touch id
[01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:44.400]   Yeah, sometimes like someone might just want your phone because they're locked out of their house
[01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:48.240]   And you want to give it to them or or someone's kids might be actually at a doctor's office
[01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:51.280]   And you want to lend them your iPad to use and if you have some sort of guest
[01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:58.560]   Wear mode for this then I'd make it you know much safer for everybody or this could be a beginning of a good password protector
[01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:05.600]   For a password fault for apple apple's got a really good password system with iCloud keychain
[01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:06.800]   But there's no way to secure it
[01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:10.240]   So if you give someone your phone they have access to all your logins and all your credit cards
[01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:14.020]   And being able to intermediate that with touch id and you know like in a perfect st
[01:12:14.020 --> 01:12:18.980]   Gibson world if you could have touch id and a password so it's multi-factor right it would be a nice addition
[01:12:18.980 --> 01:12:21.140]   nice
[01:12:21.140 --> 01:12:27.380]   Uh, ever see are we seeing true multi-users because the only stuff that I really saw was the education options?
[01:12:27.380 --> 01:12:29.940]   No, so um
[01:12:29.940 --> 01:12:34.260]   Obviously the infrastructure is going to be there whether they unlock it for regular users
[01:12:34.260 --> 01:12:40.420]   Right. Yeah, so they built out a lot of stuff that could be useful for multi-user in general
[01:12:40.420 --> 01:12:46.740]   But the way it's set up right now specifically for schools and using the mobile device management the same thing that you'd use to manage devices
[01:12:46.740 --> 01:12:49.380]   in enterprise or in any sort of large
[01:12:49.380 --> 01:12:51.940]   Organization like schools or government
[01:12:51.940 --> 01:12:58.660]   And they're doing that in two ways they're creating a new form of apple id and it's really smart because they understand that kids in kindergarten and grade one
[01:12:58.660 --> 01:13:02.100]   Don't have the same concept of a password that people in grade 12 might have
[01:13:02.100 --> 01:13:05.220]   So for kids they have a sort of a combined token
[01:13:05.220 --> 01:13:10.100]   That's four digits and they can put that in and it logs them in and unlocks the device at the same time
[01:13:10.340 --> 01:13:13.860]   Sort of abstracts away both the apple id and the passcode for the device
[01:13:13.860 --> 01:13:18.980]   And then the kid can choose their settings and this is a part that I love about apple over the last year
[01:13:18.980 --> 01:13:22.020]   Is there going all in on something which is typically called nearline?
[01:13:22.020 --> 01:13:25.300]   So because any kid could pick up this ipad and use it
[01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:29.140]   What they do is they presume that they the kids going to use the same ipad over and over again
[01:13:29.140 --> 01:13:30.900]   So they keep their data
[01:13:30.900 --> 01:13:32.900]   Local and they keep it highly available
[01:13:32.900 --> 01:13:36.660]   But if another kid picks it up it'll still store all the data until it starts running out of space
[01:13:36.980 --> 01:13:38.980]   Then it'll push that data back up to the cloud
[01:13:38.980 --> 01:13:41.940]   So you know if 30 days from now some other kid comes and picks it up
[01:13:41.940 --> 01:13:43.940]   It might have to download a bunch of stuff for that child
[01:13:43.940 --> 01:13:47.060]   But they try to be really respectful of networks and of the data
[01:13:47.060 --> 01:13:53.540]   So if you think about how iCloud photo library or how on-demand resources work, this is similar but for um
[01:13:53.540 --> 01:13:57.620]   multi-user systems specifically multi-user systems for the classroom
[01:13:57.620 --> 01:14:00.820]   And yeah, it'd be super nice to have multi-user in general for iOS
[01:14:00.820 --> 01:14:05.700]   But this one seems really really architected for being run in a managed school environment
[01:14:06.340 --> 01:14:10.580]   Yeah, there's another aspect to that that makes it a really good deal for everybody
[01:14:10.580 --> 01:14:18.020]   Google has been having tremendous success selling Chromebooks for classrooms because you know everyone's standardized on
[01:14:18.020 --> 01:14:22.740]   Google apps and they're so inexpensive, but they're also getting some flack from school systems because
[01:14:22.740 --> 01:14:32.260]   They're the students will use a special google id that doesn't track them as aggressively as a regular google id will
[01:14:32.340 --> 01:14:37.300]   But it still gives google the ability to at least create a skeleton profile of them
[01:14:37.300 --> 01:14:41.700]   And so if you don't want your kids to have an advertising profile anywhere
[01:14:41.700 --> 01:14:44.980]   You might be out of luck depending on how these systems are configured
[01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:49.380]   So it's really good for apple to detach the student use of an ipad from an apple id
[01:14:49.380 --> 01:14:55.220]   Because if they start using that apple id outside of the classroom for personal stuff that would give
[01:14:55.220 --> 01:14:59.380]   Theoretically apple or a company like apple, excuse me
[01:14:59.380 --> 01:15:01.860]   If a copy that does something like that that would give them the ability to
[01:15:01.860 --> 01:15:05.380]   Really see what they're doing inside the classroom and outside the classroom
[01:15:05.380 --> 01:15:11.620]   That's certainly not something that would be consistent with what apple presents itself to be as one that really cares about security and privacy
[01:15:11.620 --> 01:15:16.820]   And they're really good about it because there's also laws in many areas about what exactly age people can have accounts
[01:15:16.820 --> 01:15:22.420]   And my my god kids got google accounts at their school and they got home and immediately they logged in and the first thing they did
[01:15:22.420 --> 01:15:25.700]   Was a game where you use pac-man to eat all the houses on your street?
[01:15:25.780 --> 01:15:30.340]   But at the same time their parents are going okay now this this thing knows where we live because you just gave them a street
[01:15:30.340 --> 01:15:33.940]   Uh, and that's not what every even if you think it's completely mundane
[01:15:33.940 --> 01:15:41.220]   It's just it's not an experience that we're used to and this really is for a classroom setting and it's super respectful for privacy and for account handling
[01:15:41.220 --> 01:15:48.100]   All those kinds of things kids can't be expected to have the same knowledge and the same awareness that an adult adult adults have a certain obligation to understand
[01:15:48.100 --> 01:15:51.540]   The the agreement that they're entering into but you have to protect kids
[01:15:52.900 --> 01:15:56.900]   They say the news you want even more personalized actually apple got in a little
[01:15:56.900 --> 01:16:01.460]   I think a little bit of heat from news publishers admitting that they'd been screwing up the
[01:16:01.460 --> 01:16:06.500]   Estimates that they've been sending the publishers as to the number of people reading their articles in news
[01:16:06.500 --> 01:16:09.940]   Like when Steve jobs at the bars were wrong. We were supporting the bars wrong
[01:16:09.940 --> 01:16:14.900]   Uh, but now more news personalization
[01:16:14.900 --> 01:16:17.700]   Is news succeeding?
[01:16:17.700 --> 01:16:23.060]   Is it takes weirdly or like the news is one of those things where it was like a secret project at apple and very few people knew what
[01:16:23.060 --> 01:16:26.100]   What it was and that's great because you can surprise people with this news thing
[01:16:26.100 --> 01:16:31.300]   But I look at my iphone and in the series suggestions page. There's a bunch of news that has no relation to the news app
[01:16:31.300 --> 01:16:34.660]   I go to safari and it's pulling links from my social feed
[01:16:34.660 --> 01:16:37.940]   And it's it's it's sharing things that you know like I follow Andy
[01:16:37.940 --> 01:16:43.380]   So it's any like Andy shares is in there and there's also things that I've used the bookmarking feature the read later feature
[01:16:43.380 --> 01:16:47.380]   But none of these are connected to news so I go into news and I don't see things you guys have recommended
[01:16:47.460 --> 01:16:50.900]   I don't see things that I bookmarked I go to the the series minus one page
[01:16:50.900 --> 01:16:54.820]   I don't see anything from my for you and news and it's really a disconnected experience
[01:16:54.820 --> 01:16:59.940]   This is adding a layer of personalization and they're going to be doing editorial picks and they're going to be doing uh trends
[01:16:59.940 --> 01:17:04.260]   So it gives you a better sort of a slice of what it thinks might be interesting to you
[01:17:04.260 --> 01:17:08.420]   But it's still sort of sitting in this news jail and it's not being allowed to propagate
[01:17:08.420 --> 01:17:12.500]   To the operating system and one of my biggest wishes for this for news for iOS 10
[01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:17.300]   Is that they'll sort of break down those walls and let news be a core level feature like photos and like so many
[01:17:17.300 --> 01:17:19.300]   Other things are yeah
[01:17:19.300 --> 01:17:25.140]   I think that one of the things that I've seen with a lot of the news things is there's obviously there's the publishers who want to really control that
[01:17:25.140 --> 01:17:29.380]   Experience and they're trying to have some kind of lock in and have it be there
[01:17:29.380 --> 01:17:31.860]   And then of course there's how most of us want to interact with it
[01:17:31.860 --> 01:17:37.060]   Which is that it's kind of free roaming and everywhere that we're that we are and I think that trying
[01:17:37.060 --> 01:17:43.700]   Most people have been having a hard time with this. I think the only place that I've really seen it work. Well still is flip board
[01:17:44.420 --> 01:17:48.900]   Yeah, it's kind of a mixture of the two and even then you get into kind of these weird things where someone's kind of manipulated
[01:17:48.900 --> 01:17:51.700]   So that you see a little bit of it then you go to something that's totally messed up
[01:17:51.700 --> 01:17:55.540]   But for the most part, I think flip board is still the kind of the gold standard as far as
[01:17:55.540 --> 01:17:59.540]   uh grabbing that stuff and nuzzle I think is quite good on iOS that's
[01:17:59.540 --> 01:18:04.260]   It's hardly or like news it still pulls RSS and a lot of sites won't give you full RSS
[01:18:04.260 --> 01:18:06.260]   So you open it up and using they write right at the top
[01:18:06.260 --> 01:18:09.220]   There's a link to go to the website then you're out of the news and in the website already
[01:18:09.220 --> 01:18:10.660]   Yeah
[01:18:10.660 --> 01:18:13.540]   But that's and that's fine too. I just my difficulty
[01:18:14.100 --> 01:18:16.740]   I'm only speaking as a personal user that um
[01:18:16.740 --> 01:18:21.780]   It seems to be really the grad the gravity of the sap seems to be almost exclusively towards
[01:18:21.780 --> 01:18:25.060]   Let us tell you stuff that we think that you want to see
[01:18:25.060 --> 01:18:29.380]   We're asked when I I've I've done things like say I want to find out
[01:18:29.380 --> 01:18:34.740]   I want more news that's related to uh rene richy things that he's been writing and it will give me oh
[01:18:34.740 --> 01:18:38.020]   I we know that rene richy is a technology writer
[01:18:38.020 --> 01:18:40.820]   So we're going to give you a whole bunch of apple based technology sources
[01:18:41.060 --> 01:18:48.660]   No, I'm saying I want to here's the website. Please add this. No. Whoa. Oh, I'm more. Okay. Uh, here's during fireball and here's recode and here's no
[01:18:48.660 --> 01:18:51.700]   I see the words that let you do
[01:18:51.700 --> 01:18:53.620]   If you tell me about an article
[01:18:53.620 --> 01:18:57.540]   I can't find it like if you say like leo says and you wrote this great article and I want to go to use
[01:18:57.540 --> 01:19:01.300]   There's no way for me to find the article that and you wrote in news. I can find the topics
[01:19:01.300 --> 01:19:03.700]   I can find publications, but I can't find that hard
[01:19:03.700 --> 01:19:08.260]   I see I know I know that when they when they first announced this I did like fill out the form and had an
[01:19:08.260 --> 01:19:28.060]   where my stuff looks like in this news feed. Again, type in a not go, doesn't find my site but it knows I'm kind of a technology writer. I'll give the URL and we'll still think I'm just giving it a clue as to what I want as opposed to a map to the thing that I want.
[01:19:28.100 --> 01:19:45.100]   So it's not it's just hasn't been such a and even when it does the the flip board style just pick news stories for me. It hasn't been doing such a significantly better job than flip board or even Google news that it makes me want to dive into the features and understand how it works.
[01:19:45.100 --> 01:19:57.100]   I don't think that I've tested Apple news from top to bottom inside and out and found it lacking. I feel as though I haven't found that thing that got me encouraged to stick at it until I solve the problems that I seem to be having with it.
[01:19:57.100 --> 01:20:01.100]   I think it's three countries only right now. I think it's still US, UK and Australia.
[01:20:01.100 --> 01:20:07.100]   I changed my region to the US in order to use it and now I have to deal with miles. I mean it's just.
[01:20:07.100 --> 01:20:15.100]   Oh, I'm so sorry and Fahrenheit. How many of you have news on the front page of your device?
[01:20:15.100 --> 01:20:18.100]   I keep my device standard. So, okay.
[01:20:18.100 --> 01:20:20.100]   You don't modify it. You keep all the.
[01:20:20.100 --> 01:20:27.100]   I reinstall so often. I don't know where my apps are. Like I spend like an hour putting him in new places and then I'll reinstall the beta and be gone.
[01:20:27.100 --> 01:20:28.100]   So I don't.
[01:20:28.100 --> 01:20:35.100]   So are your apps just kind of a hodgepodge on page two through 80? Yeah.
[01:20:35.100 --> 01:20:42.100]   Sort of when I download them and when I reinstall they go into alphabetical order eventually. Oh, that's so sucks. It's learned helplessness.
[01:20:42.100 --> 01:20:48.100]   Andy, you don't have news on your front page. Oh, you use an Android device. Never mind.
[01:20:48.100 --> 01:20:54.100]   Alex got it. I got no I got a I've got a I've got a Mac book here, but I got an Android phone card.
[01:20:54.100 --> 01:21:02.100]   Yeah. You know, I'm looking at it. I think they're pretty much, you know, my most of my half of my front page is just messaging apps.
[01:21:02.100 --> 01:21:21.100]   Yeah, I know. And then social apps and maps and photos and then flip board and so I don't really have, you know, and then when I kind of like, you know, where I, you know, I used to organize it so that the most important things were on the first page and then the next important things were on the second page and so on and so forth.
[01:21:21.100 --> 01:21:27.100]   And now I just realized that if it's not on the front page, I'm just going to search. You know, I don't think that's not so bad. Is it?
[01:21:27.100 --> 01:21:31.100]   I just search for the app and I'm not going to try to remember where it is.
[01:21:31.100 --> 01:21:36.100]   I must be the only really anal one here because I have serious sometimes too. I just opened this app and just open it.
[01:21:36.100 --> 01:21:45.100]   Just open it. And I have a very carefully call. You only have three pages. I have my front page. By the way, I just moved news back saying I'm going to give it another shot.
[01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:54.100]   And then I have all these folders on the second page. So I find it like the death gnaw. Like if I put it right, nothing I never see too deep.
[01:21:54.100 --> 01:22:03.100]   But it's organization and then the third page is like newly installed apps and I want to check out plus a utilities app and Apple app and the settings in the app store.
[01:22:03.100 --> 01:22:07.100]   So it has to be homepage worthy to work. It's way to the top. It's tough.
[01:22:07.100 --> 01:22:13.100]   But I'm not probably a typical iPhone user because I don't know.
[01:22:13.100 --> 01:22:19.100]   Well, and I found I think that what happened for me was that in case you're wondering what happens if you add apps after you filled all the pages.
[01:22:19.100 --> 01:22:20.100]   Yeah.
[01:22:20.100 --> 01:22:21.100]   Which I've tested.
[01:22:21.100 --> 01:22:23.100]   There's a limit on how many pages you can have.
[01:22:23.100 --> 01:22:31.100]   There is. I think it's like 10 pages or something like that. And you when you get to the end of that, you keep on installing apps but they just aren't anywhere in your interface.
[01:22:31.100 --> 01:22:35.100]   They're literally just they're like magically not there. So the only way to get to them is search.
[01:22:35.100 --> 01:22:41.100]   And so I filled up one of my phones a while ago and I just found that I was searching for these apps that I just added.
[01:22:41.100 --> 01:22:44.100]   And if you delete other apps and then restart the phone, they'll magically appear.
[01:22:44.100 --> 01:22:49.100]   So you know, they're like they were there, but they were not they were in an invisible page.
[01:22:49.100 --> 01:22:51.100]   And so that is endless.
[01:22:51.100 --> 01:22:54.100]   You know, and so so you then you go kind of go through.
[01:22:54.100 --> 01:22:57.100]   Oh, I really want that app to be somewhere that I can find it because I don't remember what it's called.
[01:22:57.100 --> 01:23:02.100]   And so then you go back and you delete a couple of the whatever and the absurd number that you have.
[01:23:02.100 --> 01:23:05.100]   I have a real clutter problem because I just I have.
[01:23:05.100 --> 01:23:07.100]   Oh, well, that was such a good idea for an app.
[01:23:07.100 --> 01:23:08.100]   I really should go back and use it.
[01:23:08.100 --> 01:23:09.100]   I'm not going to delete it yet.
[01:23:09.100 --> 01:23:12.100]   And that's how I end up with 10 pages about.
[01:23:12.100 --> 01:23:18.100]   See, I could have a photo retouching folder and I have a productivity folder.
[01:23:18.100 --> 01:23:20.100]   But how about one stuffs in there? It's like you don't.
[01:23:20.100 --> 01:23:23.100]   But if I find if I need to find it, I can get to it.
[01:23:23.100 --> 01:23:30.100]   See, I don't want to have to type in, you know, and I don't even frankly have to time remember what the name of the app was.
[01:23:30.100 --> 01:23:34.100]   So it's not that helpful to ask Siri or to type it in.
[01:23:34.100 --> 01:23:35.100]   I have that.
[01:23:35.100 --> 01:23:38.100]   When I have to admit, I have different computers, I have different clients.
[01:23:38.100 --> 01:23:40.100]   I can never remember which one to launch and which one.
[01:23:40.100 --> 01:23:41.100]   So how do you find it?
[01:23:41.100 --> 01:23:43.100]   You have to just dig through page after page.
[01:23:43.100 --> 01:23:49.100]   Well, and I have to admit that what I've learned to do now is that when I get a new phone, I don't restore the phone.
[01:23:49.100 --> 01:23:51.100]   I literally like, I start over.
[01:23:51.100 --> 01:23:53.100]   And I just go, here's the deal.
[01:23:53.100 --> 01:23:55.100]   When I go, oh, I really want that app.
[01:23:55.100 --> 01:23:56.100]   I've already bought it.
[01:23:56.100 --> 01:23:57.100]   It's just a cloud download.
[01:23:57.100 --> 01:23:58.100]   Just download it.
[01:23:58.100 --> 01:24:02.100]   So when it comes to me that I don't have that app and I actually miss it, I put it on the phone.
[01:24:02.100 --> 01:24:03.100]   That's a good idea.
[01:24:03.100 --> 01:24:09.100]   And then it starts very, you know, it's kind of a meritocracy of what ends up on the phone, the next phone compared to the last phone.
[01:24:09.100 --> 01:24:10.100]   That's actually good.
[01:24:10.100 --> 01:24:12.100]   I recommend people do that with their computers.
[01:24:12.100 --> 01:24:15.100]   Don't install stuff until you, until you need it.
[01:24:15.100 --> 01:24:18.100]   But now, see, this is a thing that gripes me about springboard.
[01:24:18.100 --> 01:24:21.100]   I've always thought it was just primitive as hell.
[01:24:21.100 --> 01:24:24.100]   You can only have, but maybe I'm wrong and you guys will tell me I'm wrong.
[01:24:24.100 --> 01:24:29.100]   You can only have one instance of any, there's no aliases or shortcut idea.
[01:24:29.100 --> 01:24:31.100]   There's only one instance of any icon.
[01:24:31.100 --> 01:24:38.100]   So I can't have a folder that has photos and retouching and have an icon for the same app in both.
[01:24:38.100 --> 01:24:40.100]   That seems to be very primitive.
[01:24:40.100 --> 01:24:41.100]   Yeah.
[01:24:41.100 --> 01:24:48.100]   I mean, I agree that the launcher, the springboard is just so overdue for just a total slash and burn and rebuild.
[01:24:48.100 --> 01:24:56.100]   I, I, I, I, there was, there was, there was a couple days of rehab when I went back, when I went back to Android.
[01:24:56.100 --> 01:25:03.100]   And one of them was reminding myself that the, that the desktop on Android is simply a blank canvas that you can set up.
[01:25:03.100 --> 01:25:09.100]   However you want that I've got, I've got, I've probably got about 90 to 100 apps on the phone.
[01:25:09.100 --> 01:25:14.100]   Of which only about 18 are actually icons I have on the desktop.
[01:25:14.100 --> 01:25:15.100]   Right.
[01:25:15.100 --> 01:25:19.100]   And I can have multiple instances of them and I can set up screens that are just, just widgets.
[01:25:19.100 --> 01:25:26.100]   And just every time that, and it's, it seems silly on the iPhone and never stops silly, seeming silly on the iPhone.
[01:25:26.100 --> 01:25:35.100]   And now that I have the iPad Pro, which I legitimately use as much as I use my MacBook, it seems downright stupid.
[01:25:35.100 --> 01:25:38.100]   You know, if Apple, if you don't want to rewrite springboard, there's an easier way.
[01:25:38.100 --> 01:25:43.100]   Just say allow people to install third party launchers.
[01:25:43.100 --> 01:25:46.100]   There's a wonderful ecosystem of third party launchers on Android.
[01:25:46.100 --> 01:25:48.100]   Microsoft even makes one.
[01:25:48.100 --> 01:25:50.100]   Yeah, it's amazing.
[01:25:50.100 --> 01:25:56.100]   That's, that's, I have a couple of launchers that I haven't gone back to yet because I just haven't looked back into them.
[01:25:56.100 --> 01:26:01.100]   That are just so much, so good at predicting what app you're going to be using in any one circumstance.
[01:26:01.100 --> 01:26:05.100]   And you just want to see that kind of assistance.
[01:26:05.100 --> 01:26:14.100]   I am, I am encouraged by the fact that Apple seems to be putting a lot of that effort that they would be putting into creating a brand new version of springboard
[01:26:14.100 --> 01:26:25.100]   into trying to make springboard irrelevant, either through app launching via Siri or through trying to predict, put that little translucent icon at the corner of the screen to say,
[01:26:25.100 --> 01:26:27.100]   I'm guessing you're going to want the Starbucks app here.
[01:26:27.100 --> 01:26:29.100]   So we're going to put that there in case you want it.
[01:26:29.100 --> 01:26:34.100]   But I really need for them to stop like, you know, moving the chess piece, but leaving their finger, you know, on the rook.
[01:26:34.100 --> 01:26:36.100]   Just make them move.
[01:26:36.100 --> 01:26:42.100]   Either say you're going to either say you're going to improve springboard or say you're going to give us the next thing that makes springboard irrelevant.
[01:26:42.100 --> 01:26:45.100]   Because this is starting to become embarrassing.
[01:26:45.100 --> 01:26:52.100]   And again, I think that for me, you know, like, what it has gotten good at is on the apps that I use when we're talking about typing them in doing a search.
[01:26:52.100 --> 01:26:53.100]   It's not like I'm typing the whole name in.
[01:26:53.100 --> 01:27:01.100]   Usually, you know, if I hit F, field runners comes up immediately because that's my number one use for the F key at the beginning.
[01:27:01.100 --> 01:27:04.100]   So it's actually pretty smart and figuring out what that is.
[01:27:04.100 --> 01:27:11.100]   You know, and so, so the, so it really is, you know, pretty smart where you just like scroll down and hit the end.
[01:27:11.100 --> 01:27:18.100]   Yes, but I think we're creatures of habits. We create pathways and we, one of the pathways is just physical gesture to the app we want.
[01:27:18.100 --> 01:27:23.100]   And that searching is not even if it's just swipe down F.
[01:27:23.100 --> 01:27:27.100]   That's a change, right? You're going to have to relearn that.
[01:27:27.100 --> 01:27:30.100]   Yeah, you know, and there's got to be a better way.
[01:27:30.100 --> 01:27:33.100]   But I just find you will find that if you do it that way, it gets much faster.
[01:27:33.100 --> 01:27:40.100]   I feel like people who use iPhones kind of Stockholm syndrome, we're all just kind of, we're battered and.
[01:27:40.100 --> 01:27:43.100]   Well, also, I mean, like they were just so desperate not to repeat the mistakes of the hierarchy.
[01:27:43.100 --> 01:27:46.100]   That's why they resisted folders and first few versions.
[01:27:46.100 --> 01:27:49.100]   Right. They just didn't, they didn't think that people should have to interact with a.
[01:27:49.100 --> 01:27:56.100]   Maybe those people just have 20 apps and, or maybe I should just only have the front page apps and delete everything or.
[01:27:56.100 --> 01:27:57.100]   Well, it's a larger point though.
[01:27:57.100 --> 01:28:05.100]   I think Andy mentioned this earlier. It's the, it works on the original iPhone because it's a very simple device and they're on third party apps and you have one app in screen.
[01:28:05.100 --> 01:28:13.100]   It's easy. I mean, so many people who were just so intimidated and found computers so inaccessible could put tap an icon, tap the home button, go back, tap another icon.
[01:28:13.100 --> 01:28:19.100]   Super simple usage model, but then you look at something like the iPad Pro and it just, it doesn't make any sense anymore.
[01:28:19.100 --> 01:28:26.100]   No, and you have Carousel for the watch and you have, um, pine board and headboard for the Apple TV and there's no board for the iPad.
[01:28:26.100 --> 01:28:34.100]   And it really says like this, this can, I think Jason Snell said this, but if Apple sat down and thought about an iPad today, there's no way they just randomly come up with, with springboard again.
[01:28:34.100 --> 01:28:39.100]   It would look different. So let's move towards that, how it would look in an iPad centric world.
[01:28:39.100 --> 01:28:45.100]   It doesn't seem to understand that a phone particularly is such a weird app environment.
[01:28:45.100 --> 01:28:58.100]   I mean, I, the six apps that I use, I spend 90% of my time using on the iPad, for instance, I will just absolutely launch by simply hitting command space and typing the first couple letters because I can remember on the outliner.
[01:28:58.100 --> 01:29:15.100]   I can remember Microsoft where I can remember you, but the thing is there's going to be, there's, on a phone, there's like the six apps you use all the time, but then they're going to be 40 apps that you use maybe once a week, like that you're, maybe you're online bank, you're online banking app or maybe the app that
[01:29:15.100 --> 01:29:23.100]   gives you the online viewer guide for your cable system or whatever like that. And the times where you need to launch that, you need to be able to find it really quickly.
[01:29:23.100 --> 01:29:35.100]   And so you may, you don't know, it's terrible. There's so many apps that I want to, if I'm using the, if I'm using a Fred's Bank, I want to launch the Fred's Bank app.
[01:29:35.100 --> 01:29:41.100]   I keep wanting to type FRE, they're running, oh, they decided to name it my Fred's Bank.
[01:29:41.100 --> 01:29:53.100]   And so that's the sort of stuff that you just can't solve. And it's not even so much that it's partly that the current springboard is really, really inadequate.
[01:29:53.100 --> 01:30:05.100]   It's also, you have had iOS out for since 2000, 2009 was it, or 2008, it's like, you have had time to think about this now.
[01:30:05.100 --> 01:30:20.100]   There's been an entire presidential administration has come and gone since you came up with this idea. You're not telling me that you can't think of something better than a grid, a static grid of every icon that you have installed on this thing.
[01:30:20.100 --> 01:30:25.100]   If not, let's time figuring out how to curve glass. Actually, more time, how to launch.
[01:30:25.100 --> 01:30:34.100]   You're reminding me, Andy, that this is in fact the ninth anniversary of the announcement of the iPhone January 9th, 2007. Was it almost exactly?
[01:30:34.100 --> 01:30:38.100]   Yeah, that's when he called the Starbucks.
[01:30:38.100 --> 01:30:50.100]   To Andy's point, there are other ideas there, but there's a couple of things that it's always tough because Apple now is carrying the legacy debt we all made fun of Windows for so many years that you have hundreds of millions of people who are used to doing it this way.
[01:30:50.100 --> 01:31:01.100]   You also have people with the new education stuff who are five years old, four years old, six years old, and people who are in their 90s. You want to have a system that can scale with them.
[01:31:01.100 --> 01:31:03.100]   It's challenging. It deserves attention.
[01:31:03.100 --> 01:31:09.100]   They started Refact. I think since iOS 5, they've been refactoring springboard every year. They broke it into backboard and then frontboard.
[01:31:09.100 --> 01:31:11.100]   There's a bunch of different things in there.
[01:31:11.100 --> 01:31:20.100]   I think the XPC is doing much more. My guess is we won't really see a replacement, but like Andy said, there'll be so many ways to interact with this.
[01:31:20.100 --> 01:31:28.100]   Our understanding of what apps and what launchers will be really different. Right now, I use PCalc in widget space. I never open the app anymore.
[01:31:28.100 --> 01:31:37.100]   I use Pinterest as a share, which I never opened the Pinterest app. What it means to be an app is only a little bit different now, but in three, four years, it'll be phenomenal.
[01:31:37.100 --> 01:31:41.100]   That app's going to be on my car. This will be on my watch. That will be on my TV.
[01:31:41.100 --> 01:31:47.100]   I hope that Apple is really working on how that system works rather than just incremental changes here.
[01:31:47.100 --> 01:31:54.100]   Back to 9.3. Discover new health apps and see more on your dashboard.
[01:31:54.100 --> 01:31:56.100]   Is this a big change to health kit?
[01:31:56.100 --> 01:32:02.100]   It's part of what you see throughout iOS. I started putting recommended apps on the lock screens.
[01:32:02.100 --> 01:32:07.100]   This is just a way of recommending apps that you might find interesting because it's hard.
[01:32:07.100 --> 01:32:10.100]   Health kit does nothing really by itself. You need apps.
[01:32:10.100 --> 01:32:15.100]   Yeah, and all the data. It's basically just a database for all your health information.
[01:32:15.100 --> 01:32:19.100]   When you're out of that context, you leave health and then you go, "I want an app."
[01:32:19.100 --> 01:32:25.100]   This is trying to put those apps front and center. When you're thinking about health, it gives you apps that it thinks will go with you.
[01:32:25.100 --> 01:32:33.100]   I think the other change that they don't mention on this page, which is at apple.com/ioS/Preview,
[01:32:33.100 --> 01:32:36.100]   is you can now pair two Apple watches.
[01:32:36.100 --> 01:32:39.100]   That's an Apple Watch 2.2 beta.
[01:32:39.100 --> 01:32:42.100]   That release from Apple watches update.
[01:32:42.100 --> 01:32:45.100]   You've got a new Maps app and you maps glance.
[01:32:45.100 --> 01:32:52.100]   Siri now also supports Malay, Finnish, and Hebrew, which are nice additions.
[01:32:52.100 --> 01:32:55.100]   She woke up and said, "Okay, I'll support..."
[01:32:55.100 --> 01:33:01.100]   She actually said, "Okay, I'll do that." It was nice of you.
[01:33:01.100 --> 01:33:03.100]   Let's see. What else is...
[01:33:03.100 --> 01:33:06.100]   TVOS brings back the Bluetooth keyboard.
[01:33:06.100 --> 01:33:11.100]   And now there's a big debate about whether we can get PC-style games.
[01:33:11.100 --> 01:33:14.100]   Some people are really enthusiastic and others are saying that it's just not capable yet.
[01:33:14.100 --> 01:33:15.100]   On the watch.
[01:33:15.100 --> 01:33:17.100]   No, sorry, with keyboards on the Apple TV.
[01:33:17.100 --> 01:33:18.100]   Oh, keyboards on the Apple TV.
[01:33:18.100 --> 01:33:20.100]   TVOS, that's right.
[01:33:20.100 --> 01:33:22.100]   They did release everything yesterday.
[01:33:22.100 --> 01:33:28.100]   I have to admit, I don't even consider using that stupid little keyboard that you have to scroll back and forth on.
[01:33:28.100 --> 01:33:30.100]   I mean, as soon as I see it, I'm going on my phone.
[01:33:30.100 --> 01:33:33.100]   I just open up my phone and I hit remote and I just type it in.
[01:33:33.100 --> 01:33:34.100]   I'm like, "Oh, I'm not going to..."
[01:33:34.100 --> 01:33:35.100]   Yeah, I just...
[01:33:35.100 --> 01:33:36.100]   Bluetooth keyboard support would be great.
[01:33:36.100 --> 01:33:40.100]   I have a leftover Apple wedge Bluetooth wireless keyboard.
[01:33:40.100 --> 01:33:43.100]   I will just put it in the living room and it'll make me eat my life so much easier.
[01:33:43.100 --> 01:33:45.100]   That will be...
[01:33:45.100 --> 01:33:46.100]   And that will all...
[01:33:46.100 --> 01:33:48.100]   We think all probably come out in March, right?
[01:33:48.100 --> 01:33:49.100]   Yeah.
[01:33:49.100 --> 01:33:50.100]   That's a good sense.
[01:33:50.100 --> 01:33:52.100]   It makes sense.
[01:33:52.100 --> 01:33:58.100]   There's no truth to the rumor that Apple is making an iPhone to Android switching tool.
[01:33:58.100 --> 01:33:59.100]   They're not.
[01:33:59.100 --> 01:34:02.100]   They have an Android iPhone switching tool.
[01:34:02.100 --> 01:34:03.100]   Yes.
[01:34:03.100 --> 01:34:04.100]   But they're not going the other way.
[01:34:04.100 --> 01:34:06.100]   So just take that on.
[01:34:06.100 --> 01:34:13.100]   I think they would only do that under legal duress and only if they lost the eighth appeal.
[01:34:13.100 --> 01:34:14.100]   Right.
[01:34:14.100 --> 01:34:15.100]   You know, there's no...
[01:34:15.100 --> 01:34:16.100]   In the EU, yeah.
[01:34:16.100 --> 01:34:19.100]   Anything else?
[01:34:19.100 --> 01:34:23.100]   Okay, anything else VLC is now available on the TVOS App Store.
[01:34:23.100 --> 01:34:24.100]   That's good news.
[01:34:24.100 --> 01:34:27.100]   VLC is our favorite video player.
[01:34:27.100 --> 01:34:31.100]   I think we covered it all, right?
[01:34:31.100 --> 01:34:33.100]   Anything else you guys want to bring up before we go to our break?
[01:34:33.100 --> 01:34:37.100]   I was trying to think of what the feature that you'd really need VLC on the Apple TV,
[01:34:37.100 --> 01:34:41.100]   but I guess that one of the things would be to be able to pull direct streams in, you know,
[01:34:41.100 --> 01:34:43.100]   to view raw streams.
[01:34:43.100 --> 01:34:47.100]   Like a lot of times we have test streams when we're doing it to HLS that are just, you know,
[01:34:47.100 --> 01:34:48.100]   an internal stream.
[01:34:48.100 --> 01:34:50.100]   I just need a URL to do that.
[01:34:50.100 --> 01:34:52.100]   And I think that those would be the kind of things we'd use for VLC.
[01:34:52.100 --> 01:34:57.100]   If anyone else is wondering along with me why you would need VLC on an Apple Apple TV,
[01:34:57.100 --> 01:35:00.100]   that would be those kind of hacks would be useful.
[01:35:00.100 --> 01:35:06.100]   Those of you who celebrate the arrival of VLC on TVOS know exactly why.
[01:35:06.100 --> 01:35:11.100]   Why didn't want to talk about that?
[01:35:11.100 --> 01:35:15.100]   Let us take a break and come back with your picks of the week gentlemen.
[01:35:15.100 --> 01:35:16.100]   Prepare them.
[01:35:16.100 --> 01:35:18.100]   Our show today brought to you by Gazelle.
[01:35:18.100 --> 01:35:23.100]   You're hearing all this excitement about iPhones and iPads.
[01:35:23.100 --> 01:35:27.100]   Maybe you think it's time to get a new one to upgrade.
[01:35:27.100 --> 01:35:28.100]   Well, Gazelle's the place.
[01:35:28.100 --> 01:35:29.100]   Just keep this in mind.
[01:35:29.100 --> 01:35:33.100]   If you think you're going to do it in the next 30 days, now would be the time to go to Gazelle.com
[01:35:33.100 --> 01:35:34.100]   and get a quote.
[01:35:34.100 --> 01:35:37.100]   Gazelle locks those quotes in for 30 days.
[01:35:37.100 --> 01:35:39.100]   You don't have to take action for 30 days.
[01:35:39.100 --> 01:35:43.100]   That means you have plenty of time to decide, buy, transfer your data over,
[01:35:43.100 --> 01:35:44.100]   and then send it to Gazelle.
[01:35:44.100 --> 01:35:45.100]   Even pay the postage.
[01:35:45.100 --> 01:35:47.100]   Make it very easy.
[01:35:47.100 --> 01:35:55.100]   In fact, my suggestion is I am learning the Japanese art of tidying up from Rickondo.
[01:35:55.100 --> 01:35:58.100]   And you're wondering, what do I do with all this old stuff?
[01:35:58.100 --> 01:35:59.100]   Don't throw it out.
[01:35:59.100 --> 01:36:02.100]   Go to Gazelle and get some cash for that.
[01:36:02.100 --> 01:36:07.100]   Buy some beautiful flowers and some herbal tea with your cash or more.
[01:36:07.100 --> 01:36:12.100]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E, maybe get yourself the new device.
[01:36:12.100 --> 01:36:20.100]   Because the new iPhone and iPad are now widely purchased, that means they have a lot of old stuff to sell as well.
[01:36:20.100 --> 01:36:27.100]   Older iPhones from the 4S through the 6 Plus, great for replacing a broken device or getting a device for your kids.
[01:36:27.100 --> 01:36:30.100]   They have iPads and they standard air and mini models.
[01:36:30.100 --> 01:36:31.100]   Samsung Galaxy phones.
[01:36:31.100 --> 01:36:33.100]   This is the part of Gazelle that's new.
[01:36:33.100 --> 01:36:39.100]   They sell certified, slightly used pre-owned devices.
[01:36:39.100 --> 01:36:46.100]   Every one of them has been put through Gazelle's rigorous 30-point inspection, so they work fully and there's no major scratches or anything.
[01:36:46.100 --> 01:36:51.100]   They have a variety of quality choices between excellent good.
[01:36:51.100 --> 01:36:58.100]   So you can get it just like new, but you pay a little more or save money and have a little gentle signs of wear.
[01:36:58.100 --> 01:37:05.100]   But of course in every case you have a 30-day return policy and no cost to you, so you really have no risk.
[01:37:05.100 --> 01:37:06.100]   I love Gazelle.
[01:37:06.100 --> 01:37:20.100]   To buy or to sell, G-A-Z-E-L-L-E, bring new life to old gadgets, replace your stuff with pre-owned gadgets at gazelle.
[01:37:20.100 --> 01:37:25.100]   .com time for our picks of the week.
[01:37:25.100 --> 01:37:27.100]   Alex, you want some time or do you have something for us?
[01:37:27.100 --> 01:37:28.100]   Sure.
[01:37:28.100 --> 01:37:29.100]   No, I don't need time.
[01:37:29.100 --> 01:37:44.100]   So the CFO in the company who happens to also be my wife has been giving me a lot of grief that I don't keep track of my mileage for tax purposes and all those things.
[01:37:44.100 --> 01:37:47.100]   You need that fresh books.
[01:37:47.100 --> 01:37:51.100]   And that's in the end.
[01:37:51.100 --> 01:37:53.100]   It's always be closing.
[01:37:53.100 --> 01:37:56.100]   [laughter]
[01:37:56.100 --> 01:38:01.100]   The app that I started playing with that I'm pretty happy with is MileIQ.
[01:38:01.100 --> 01:38:02.100]   Have you seen that?
[01:38:02.100 --> 01:38:03.100]   Yeah, it's very good.
[01:38:03.100 --> 01:38:07.100]   And you can say this is business, this is personal.
[01:38:07.100 --> 01:38:08.100]   It's just like cards.
[01:38:08.100 --> 01:38:10.100]   I think the interface is just really good.
[01:38:10.100 --> 01:38:15.100]   So you just have it, you don't have to think about it once it's on, you're just driving around.
[01:38:15.100 --> 01:38:17.100]   And it just keeps track of car stop, car start.
[01:38:17.100 --> 01:38:23.100]   It just keeps track of all your movements and breaks those up into trips.
[01:38:23.100 --> 01:38:27.100]   And then you just scroll back and forth, you can add some notes to it and so on and so forth.
[01:38:27.100 --> 01:38:30.100]   And then you can just submit it all as an email.
[01:38:30.100 --> 01:38:33.100]   And I can't remember how much it costs.
[01:38:33.100 --> 01:38:35.100]   But it was, I think it was--
[01:38:35.100 --> 01:38:36.100]   It's about 99, something like that.
[01:38:36.100 --> 01:38:37.100]   It's not expensive.
[01:38:37.100 --> 01:38:38.100]   Yeah, it was easy.
[01:38:38.100 --> 01:38:45.100]   And anyway, I found it to be, I just always like to see good interfaces.
[01:38:45.100 --> 01:38:47.100]   If they thought about it, they thought they made it easy.
[01:38:47.100 --> 01:38:51.100]   They make it, you know, these kind of things need to be get to a point where they're kind of seamless.
[01:38:51.100 --> 01:38:55.100]   Like you don't think about it unless you let your battery run out on your phone and then you restart it.
[01:38:55.100 --> 01:38:56.100]   You're sorry.
[01:38:56.100 --> 01:39:00.100]   Then you take that long trip and then you go back to itemize it and you're like, it's gone.
[01:39:00.100 --> 01:39:01.100]   Oh, it's free.
[01:39:01.100 --> 01:39:02.100]   But there must be in that purchases, right?
[01:39:02.100 --> 01:39:04.100]   I think there's an in that purchase.
[01:39:04.100 --> 01:39:05.100]   Yeah.
[01:39:05.100 --> 01:39:06.100]   Yeah.
[01:39:06.100 --> 01:39:07.100]   And you know, to subscribe to it or whatever.
[01:39:07.100 --> 01:39:08.100]   Yeah, there you go.
[01:39:08.100 --> 01:39:09.100]   599.
[01:39:09.100 --> 01:39:10.100]   All right.
[01:39:10.100 --> 01:39:11.100]   Yeah, and but you can play with it.
[01:39:11.100 --> 01:39:13.100]   You can download it for free, play with it, and then upgrade it.
[01:39:13.100 --> 01:39:18.100]   Which I think is a good, when we talk about demos, I mean, I think that that kind of demo thing works pretty well,
[01:39:18.100 --> 01:39:21.100]   where you just do in that purchase to move to that process.
[01:39:21.100 --> 01:39:26.100]   But I'm kind of surprised that now I understand why she was so upset because once I started doing it,
[01:39:26.100 --> 01:39:30.100]   I realized how many business trips I was just kind of paying attention.
[01:39:30.100 --> 01:39:31.100]   Yeah.
[01:39:31.100 --> 01:39:33.100]   I was like, oh, wow.
[01:39:33.100 --> 01:39:35.100]   I drive a lot.
[01:39:35.100 --> 01:39:40.100]   You know, so anyway, so I think that it's a pretty useful app.
[01:39:40.100 --> 01:39:44.100]   My IQ, my life, IQ, my IQ.
[01:39:44.100 --> 01:39:45.100]   I like you.
[01:39:45.100 --> 01:39:46.100]   My IQ.
[01:39:46.100 --> 01:39:48.100]   Keep track of your driving.
[01:39:48.100 --> 01:39:52.100]   We also, the automatic, which is another sponsor, that little OBD to dongle.
[01:39:52.100 --> 01:39:54.100]   We'll do that for you too, which is nice.
[01:39:54.100 --> 01:39:58.100]   I like, I like something that does it automatically because it is a pain in the butt.
[01:39:58.100 --> 01:39:59.100]   It really has to be.
[01:39:59.100 --> 01:39:59.100]   Yeah.
[01:39:59.100 --> 01:40:01.100]   Those are the kinds of things you want to have happen.
[01:40:01.100 --> 01:40:02.100]   Yeah.
[01:40:02.100 --> 01:40:03.100]   And there's no reason I can't now, really.
[01:40:03.100 --> 01:40:04.100]   Yeah.
[01:40:04.100 --> 01:40:06.100]   Renee Richie, your pick of the week.
[01:40:06.100 --> 01:40:10.100]   So I have a pick of the week that I am completely unqualified to properly represent.
[01:40:10.100 --> 01:40:12.100]   But I'm going to mention it anyway because it is awesome.
[01:40:12.100 --> 01:40:13.100]   It's called Pythonista.
[01:40:13.100 --> 01:40:15.100]   It just hit version 2.0.
[01:40:15.100 --> 01:40:17.100]   And we were talking about automation and scripting before.
[01:40:17.100 --> 01:40:22.100]   What Pythonista does is bring pretty awesome Python scripting abilities to iOS.
[01:40:22.100 --> 01:40:28.100]   It's made by Old Zorn, who's the same one who made editorial, which also has phenomenal scripting
[01:40:28.100 --> 01:40:29.100]   ability.
[01:40:29.100 --> 01:40:31.100]   Yeah, that's Federico Vitticci from MacStory is right up on it.
[01:40:31.100 --> 01:40:34.100]   And he's a huge iPad Pro and automation connoisseur.
[01:40:34.100 --> 01:40:37.100]   And it just, it does everything that you'd expect it to do.
[01:40:37.100 --> 01:40:41.100]   Again, like I know nothing about Python and I have not had a chance to use it, but just
[01:40:41.100 --> 01:40:43.100]   looking at it, it is so impressive.
[01:40:43.100 --> 01:40:47.100]   And it shows that things like this and like workflow and like editorial shows that for
[01:40:47.100 --> 01:40:52.100]   all the limitations that are imposed on iOS, there are still some spectacularly cool things
[01:40:52.100 --> 01:40:53.100]   that can be done with it.
[01:40:53.100 --> 01:40:58.100]   So if you've been frustrated, the lack of your ability to maybe script or automate or code
[01:40:58.100 --> 01:41:03.100]   tasks on iOS, Pythonista, the big change in version 2.0 is it now supports all the new
[01:41:03.100 --> 01:41:08.100]   screen sizes up to and including iPad Pro and all the iOS 9 features.
[01:41:08.100 --> 01:41:10.100]   Yeah, but it just looks incredible.
[01:41:10.100 --> 01:41:16.100]   I used to for a long time when I tried to install fourth and Python and everything mobile to
[01:41:16.100 --> 01:41:18.100]   face and gave up.
[01:41:18.100 --> 01:41:20.100]   But with this, I mean, you got to complete IDE.
[01:41:20.100 --> 01:41:27.100]   I don't know how many hooks you have into iOS, but you could write Python apps and in some
[01:41:27.100 --> 01:41:30.100]   cases you'd actually be able to hook into iOS and do stuff.
[01:41:30.100 --> 01:41:32.100]   This is a boy that's power.
[01:41:32.100 --> 01:41:35.100]   It puts stuff in the action extensions, which is sort of like what workflow does, which
[01:41:35.100 --> 01:41:37.100]   means they're not bound-boomed to their own app.
[01:41:37.100 --> 01:41:39.100]   You can implement some of that stuff inside other apps.
[01:41:39.100 --> 01:41:40.100]   That's great.
[01:41:40.100 --> 01:41:41.100]   Boy, this is nice.
[01:41:41.100 --> 01:41:46.100]   This is the kind of thing that when you do this, this really puts light of the idea that
[01:41:46.100 --> 01:41:50.100]   an iPad is a consumption device because this is a programming language.
[01:41:50.100 --> 01:41:53.100]   You have to concentrate on Microsoft today, called it a companion device.
[01:41:53.100 --> 01:41:55.100]   You can actually do pretty cool stuff.
[01:41:55.100 --> 01:41:56.100]   Yeah, wow.
[01:41:56.100 --> 01:41:57.100]   That's nice.
[01:41:57.100 --> 01:41:58.100]   I love Python.
[01:41:58.100 --> 01:41:59.100]   Yeah.
[01:41:59.100 --> 01:42:04.100]   Good pick.
[01:42:04.100 --> 01:42:07.100]   Python East at $10.
[01:42:07.100 --> 01:42:10.100]   From iTunes for your iOS device, from OMSZ software.
[01:42:10.100 --> 01:42:13.100]   Andy Inaco?
[01:42:13.100 --> 01:42:16.100]   I'm still on the...
[01:42:16.100 --> 01:42:17.100]   Oops.
[01:42:17.100 --> 01:42:18.100]   You're frozen solid.
[01:42:18.100 --> 01:42:19.100]   Oh, dear.
[01:42:19.100 --> 01:42:20.100]   That's a good shot, though.
[01:42:20.100 --> 01:42:21.100]   Put it on up again.
[01:42:21.100 --> 01:42:22.100]   I like it.
[01:42:22.100 --> 01:42:23.100]   You look like Intrepid.
[01:42:23.100 --> 01:42:25.100]   The Intrepid Andy Inaco.
[01:42:25.100 --> 01:42:28.100]   The implacable Andy Inaco.
[01:42:28.100 --> 01:42:35.100]   Now, here we are boarding all spaceship to investigate the seventh quadrant.
[01:42:35.100 --> 01:42:40.100]   If only a Contrepid young reporter, Holly Henderson, were here to document this.
[01:42:40.100 --> 01:42:43.100]   Oh, you just saw editioning for the next incomparable.
[01:42:43.100 --> 01:42:45.100]   I know you.
[01:42:45.100 --> 01:42:48.100]   I need to update my radio IMDB.
[01:42:48.100 --> 01:42:50.100]   What do you got for us?
[01:42:50.100 --> 01:42:53.100]   Actually, I get two things, but one of them you want to show, I know.
[01:42:53.100 --> 01:42:58.100]   One I wanted to show, so if we can't get the video going, then we'll just save that for
[01:42:58.100 --> 01:42:59.100]   next week.
[01:42:59.100 --> 01:43:00.100]   I had a couple of things anyway.
[01:43:00.100 --> 01:43:04.100]   So the other one is Aurora HDR, which is...
[01:43:04.100 --> 01:43:05.100]   I think someone's...
[01:43:05.100 --> 01:43:09.100]   It's been around for a little while, so I think that someone else certainly picked it.
[01:43:09.100 --> 01:43:15.100]   But I wanted to add my own endorsement because I just actually bought my own copy of it a few weeks ago.
[01:43:15.100 --> 01:43:17.100]   And it's such a great tool.
[01:43:17.100 --> 01:43:24.100]   People have this idea correctly of that HDR is historically where it's a professional photographer
[01:43:24.100 --> 01:43:30.100]   on a tripod, bracketing exposures to get pictures of sunsets and it's really the sort of thing
[01:43:30.100 --> 01:43:35.100]   that you would only get if you are this really high-falutant photographer.
[01:43:35.100 --> 01:43:40.100]   But the thing is that HDR also works with a single individual photo.
[01:43:40.100 --> 01:43:44.100]   So, first of all, you can actually just take a picture with your phone and then dump it
[01:43:44.100 --> 01:43:50.100]   into the photo over our HDR and it will basically look for all of the detail that's sort of hidden
[01:43:50.100 --> 01:43:52.100]   in there to create a sort of...
[01:43:52.100 --> 01:43:56.100]   An HDR based on sort of exposure twiddling with it.
[01:43:56.100 --> 01:44:03.100]   But the upshot is that it is such a quick and effective way to get from the photo that you have
[01:44:03.100 --> 01:44:05.100]   to the photo that you had in mind.
[01:44:05.100 --> 01:44:13.100]   It's not as though the Photos app or Lightroom or Aperture can't help you to bring out details
[01:44:13.100 --> 01:44:15.100]   and shadows and intensify colors.
[01:44:15.100 --> 01:44:17.100]   But the thing is the fur...
[01:44:17.100 --> 01:44:19.100]   The HDR will make.
[01:44:19.100 --> 01:44:23.100]   It's going to be really close to something more dramatic and wonderful.
[01:44:23.100 --> 01:44:29.100]   And then when you start sliding things around, not with an understanding necessarily of what each of these things do,
[01:44:29.100 --> 01:44:31.100]   but just sliding things around.
[01:44:31.100 --> 01:44:33.100]   I wish that were a little bit brighter.
[01:44:33.100 --> 01:44:35.100]   I wish the shadows were a little bit less intense.
[01:44:35.100 --> 01:44:37.100]   I think that red is a little bit too strong.
[01:44:37.100 --> 01:44:39.100]   I think that green should be a little bit stronger.
[01:44:39.100 --> 01:44:41.100]   You can just push sliders around.
[01:44:41.100 --> 01:44:43.100]   And it just gets great results.
[01:44:43.100 --> 01:44:44.100]   It really is.
[01:44:44.100 --> 01:44:49.100]   We're now at the point where if you spent more than $180 on a smartphone,
[01:44:49.100 --> 01:44:54.100]   all of the cameras are at least within, let's say, five percentage points of each other.
[01:44:54.100 --> 01:45:05.100]   But then when you add a tool like Aurora HDR, it turns into something that's super close to what you'd get off of a really good $500-600 pocket camera.
[01:45:05.100 --> 01:45:08.100]   Because it will just simulate all of those effects.
[01:45:08.100 --> 01:45:15.100]   And don't even think that the course of demo pictures they have up there are the sort of super HDR looking,
[01:45:15.100 --> 01:45:18.100]   bordering on artificial looking stuff.
[01:45:18.100 --> 01:45:20.100]   But you can also get really subtle effects.
[01:45:20.100 --> 01:45:31.100]   One of the things I've been doing with it recently is just going through old photos in my Flickr gallery of pictures that were as good as I could make them last year or the year before.
[01:45:31.100 --> 01:45:37.100]   And then even just downloading it as a JPEG, I'll open it in Aurora HDR to see if I can make it better.
[01:45:37.100 --> 01:45:47.100]   And so I think I have a link to it in the show notes of this picture, this comedian and cosplayer from near Comic Con 2014-2013,
[01:45:47.100 --> 01:45:49.100]   that super, super low light.
[01:45:49.100 --> 01:45:51.100]   I had to jack up the ISO really, really high.
[01:45:51.100 --> 01:46:02.100]   So I was never really super happy with it, but put it into Aurora HDR and was able to finally tweak it so that it looks like it was shot at 200 ISO with good lighting.
[01:46:02.100 --> 01:46:04.100]   So I'm really, really happy with it.
[01:46:04.100 --> 01:46:10.100]   It's 40 bucks, you can get a free demo of it that will do everything except for save images, I think.
[01:46:10.100 --> 01:46:14.100]   For 40 bucks, you get the version that will process JPEGs.
[01:46:14.100 --> 01:46:21.100]   For $100, you get the version that can also handle RAW files natively as a few extra features.
[01:46:21.100 --> 01:46:26.100]   I went for the 99 bucks version and part of it was just that I just wanted these people to have more money.
[01:46:26.100 --> 01:46:28.100]   So I'm really happy with it.
[01:46:28.100 --> 01:46:34.100]   For a lot of people, it's almost as good as buying a whole new camera or upgrading your phone just to get a better camera.
[01:46:34.100 --> 01:46:37.100]   There are a lot of HDR programs I use Photomatics for years.
[01:46:37.100 --> 01:46:39.100]   This is Trey Rakcliffe's program.
[01:46:39.100 --> 01:46:41.100]   He designed it with Mac fun.
[01:46:41.100 --> 01:46:43.100]   He's the king of HDR.
[01:46:43.100 --> 01:46:48.100]   It's a modern UI for one thing, but it really does a nice job.
[01:46:48.100 --> 01:46:50.100]   I agree with you 100%.
[01:46:50.100 --> 01:46:52.100]   This is just a fantastic program.
[01:46:52.100 --> 01:46:55.100]   Even just a generalized photo editor, it's just fantastic.
[01:46:55.100 --> 01:47:00.100]   If you spring for the 100 bucks, it will also integrate with aperture and lightroom.
[01:47:00.100 --> 01:47:03.100]   So you can just simply pull it down off a menu.
[01:47:03.100 --> 01:47:09.100]   Mac fun makes a lot of really nice plugins, including Tonality Pro, which we've also mentioned.
[01:47:09.100 --> 01:47:10.100]   You have good black and white.
[01:47:10.100 --> 01:47:11.100]   Noiseless too.
[01:47:11.100 --> 01:47:12.100]   That's another thing.
[01:47:12.100 --> 01:47:22.100]   If you're using a phone as your primary camera, it will just do such a great job of knocking down all that high ISO noise that are almost inevitable when you're shooting in low light.
[01:47:22.100 --> 01:47:28.100]   I think this is an important point, is that an HDR doesn't require multiple images.
[01:47:28.100 --> 01:47:36.100]   Even with your smartphone now, there's enough dynamic range in the single image that you can actually do some really great stuff.
[01:47:36.100 --> 01:47:39.100]   It doesn't have to look like you're painting something.
[01:47:39.100 --> 01:47:42.100]   There were these guys who have done a great job with it.
[01:47:42.100 --> 01:47:43.100]   I completely agree with you.
[01:47:43.100 --> 01:47:47.100]   Aurora HDR from Mac fun.
[01:47:47.100 --> 01:47:49.100]   PHUN.
[01:47:49.100 --> 01:47:54.100]   Well Renee, since you mentioned, I'm going to blame you on this.
[01:47:54.100 --> 01:48:04.100]   Since you mentioned Pythonista, I'm going to show you two programs for the Macintosh that I really like.
[01:48:04.100 --> 01:48:06.100]   Not very expensive.
[01:48:06.100 --> 01:48:11.100]   As you know, I'm a programming language, a physio nato.
[01:48:11.100 --> 01:48:18.100]   I collect them, love Python, but I've been playing a lot with functional languages, which is the oldest kind of languages.
[01:48:18.100 --> 01:48:24.100]   For many reasons, some often consider the best languages for learning programming like Lisp.
[01:48:24.100 --> 01:48:29.100]   There's an excellent Lisp in the App Store, which I highly recommend.
[01:48:29.100 --> 01:48:38.100]   Confusingly named closure, C-L-O-Z-U-R-E-C-L, but it is a full common Lisp.
[01:48:38.100 --> 01:48:42.100]   It includes a REPL and IDE, everything you need to program.
[01:48:42.100 --> 01:48:43.100]   It's very easy.
[01:48:43.100 --> 01:48:45.100]   You don't have to use Emacs, which a lot of people do.
[01:48:45.100 --> 01:48:47.100]   Highly recommend it.
[01:48:47.100 --> 01:48:50.100]   I think this is free.
[01:48:50.100 --> 01:48:55.100]   Then because I've been also learning Haskell, I was very pleased to find this.
[01:48:55.100 --> 01:49:00.100]   Haskell is a really remarkable programming language, also functional that's being used by more and more people.
[01:49:00.100 --> 01:49:08.100]   We're lucky because on Mac, the easiest way to learn Haskell is with Haskell functional programming lab for the Mac.
[01:49:08.100 --> 01:49:09.100]   I don't have it installed in here.
[01:49:09.100 --> 01:49:10.100]   It's $20.
[01:49:10.100 --> 01:49:12.100]   Well worth it.
[01:49:12.100 --> 01:49:21.100]   Because it not only gives you an IDE and the ability to write Haskell programs, but it's got a playground.
[01:49:21.100 --> 01:49:27.100]   One of the points that the programmers make on this is inspired by Swift.
[01:49:27.100 --> 01:49:33.100]   You know, REPL is the idea that you'd have a command line where you could try language commands and see the result.
[01:49:33.100 --> 01:49:41.100]   We're great in their day, but really, playgrounds are the new hotness and Swift really introduced that.
[01:49:41.100 --> 01:49:46.100]   If you've been looking to learn functional languages, this is a really great way to do it.
[01:49:46.100 --> 01:49:51.100]   This has a playground that allows you to execute Haskell commands, modify Haskell programs.
[01:49:51.100 --> 01:49:56.100]   While you're running them, it really is sweet.
[01:49:56.100 --> 01:50:04.100]   This makes the Mac really the platform to learn Haskell or Lisp with closure.
[01:50:04.100 --> 01:50:09.100]   So two for one there.
[01:50:09.100 --> 01:50:20.100]   Just because all of those other, you know, objective C, Swift, C++, those are at the top of the Java, those are the languages for the popular kids.
[01:50:20.100 --> 01:50:23.100]   Don't turn your back on functional programming.
[01:50:23.100 --> 01:50:26.100]   Hey everybody, that concludes this edition.
[01:50:26.100 --> 01:50:33.100]   You started it by recommending Python Easter and I thought, well if he's going to recommend a language, I'll do it.
[01:50:33.100 --> 01:50:43.100]   Thank you all for joining us. We really appreciate when your time, every Tuesday morning 11am Pacific 2pm Eastern time.
[01:50:43.100 --> 01:50:46.100]   And Renee, Richie from iMore.com.
[01:50:46.100 --> 01:50:48.100]   He's got about a hundred other podcasts.
[01:50:48.100 --> 01:50:52.100]   I was very relieved to see your New Year resolution was fewer podcasts.
[01:50:52.100 --> 01:50:53.100]   Yes.
[01:50:53.100 --> 01:50:54.100]   Thank you.
[01:50:54.100 --> 01:50:55.100]   Please, would you?
[01:50:55.100 --> 01:50:56.100]   Knock it off.
[01:50:56.100 --> 01:50:57.100]   I can't do it.
[01:50:57.100 --> 01:51:06.100]   No, I really love all the stuff you do at iMore.com, including all those great podcasts. Don't do too many fewer.
[01:51:06.100 --> 01:51:12.100]   Alex Lindsay's here. He's in DC. He, of course, works at Pixelcore.
[01:51:12.100 --> 01:51:20.100]   I don't know. Can't imagine what he's doing in Washington in the nation's capital on the eve of President Obama's last State of the Union address.
[01:51:20.100 --> 01:51:26.100]   But whatever you're doing, I hope it works out for you and the kid.
[01:51:26.100 --> 01:51:28.100]   It's great to see you.
[01:51:28.100 --> 01:51:33.100]   Alex, I got to think that there is a new season of the Amazing Race starting.
[01:51:33.100 --> 01:51:34.100]   That's it.
[01:51:34.100 --> 01:51:36.100]   So, yes, you'll forgive me of some point.
[01:51:36.100 --> 01:51:39.100]   I'm going to pretend that you're actually crewing the Amazing Race.
[01:51:39.100 --> 01:51:40.100]   Wouldn't that be awesome?
[01:51:40.100 --> 01:51:41.100]   I thought I was going to ask the cards.
[01:51:41.100 --> 01:51:43.100]   I was sure it was how it would be.
[01:51:43.100 --> 01:51:44.100]   That would be a lot of fun.
[01:51:44.100 --> 01:51:47.100]   I'm trying to talk Andy into it, starting an Amazing Race team with me.
[01:51:47.100 --> 01:51:50.100]   Oh, well, well, well, well, well, well, you guys have been great.
[01:51:50.100 --> 01:51:51.100]   Let's see if we could call that.
[01:51:51.100 --> 01:51:56.100]   Andy Enoco is frozen in time at C.W.O.B..
[01:51:56.100 --> 01:51:57.100]   Common.
[01:51:57.100 --> 01:52:02.100]   He also writes regularly for the Chicago Sun times.
[01:52:02.100 --> 01:52:05.100]   And at least I can take my shirt off without starting.
[01:52:05.100 --> 01:52:07.100]   I love the old one.
[01:52:07.100 --> 01:52:08.100]   I think that's actually.
[01:52:08.100 --> 01:52:09.100]   Go to the pants.
[01:52:09.100 --> 01:52:10.100]   It's the pants.
[01:52:10.100 --> 01:52:12.100]   We're on the clock now.
[01:52:12.100 --> 01:52:14.100]   Hey, thanks for being here.
[01:52:14.100 --> 01:52:17.100]   Come back next Tuesday, 11 a.m. Pacific, 2 p.m.
[01:52:17.100 --> 01:52:20.100]   Eastern time 1900 UTC or watch on demand.
[01:52:20.100 --> 01:52:24.100]   We have audio and video available at Twitter TV/Mbw.
[01:52:24.100 --> 01:52:27.100]   And you can also subscribe every piecatcher has it.
[01:52:27.100 --> 01:52:30.100]   Every platform has an app.
[01:52:30.100 --> 01:52:32.100]   We're everywhere you want to be.
[01:52:32.100 --> 01:52:35.100]   I don't think this is one show for your Mac user, Apple user,
[01:52:35.100 --> 01:52:36.100]   that you just don't want to miss.
[01:52:36.100 --> 01:52:37.100]   Thanks for being here.
[01:52:37.100 --> 01:52:39.100]   Now back to work because you know what?
