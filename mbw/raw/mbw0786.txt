[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.680]   We are all present today joining us from Canada.
[00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:57.680]   ReneeRitchie.com/ReneeRitchie.
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.680]   Hi Renee.
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.680]   Hi Leo.
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:00.680]   Good to see you.
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.920]   It's cold up here again already.
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.200]   I got warm beverages and I'm hunkered down.
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.440]   You fall hit hard.
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.560]   All of a sudden we're having fall too.
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.240]   We went from 30 to like, I don't know, 12.
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.240]   Something like that.
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.280]   Yesterday, the day before was like in the 90s and now it's like I'm getting my sweaters
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.280]   out.
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.120]   Andy Nacos is also here from the cold part of the country.
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.120]   Hello Andrew.
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.960]   Yeah, it's crisp.
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:26.960]   It's not cold.
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.200]   It's balmy.
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.840]   We're at that level where it's like, okay, is it worth pulling down the old storm windows
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.080]   and turning on the heaters again?
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.520]   Or can I put that off for another week?
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.000]   Well, actually I just got this warm little shirt.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.680]   Maybe I'll just start wearing this warm little shirt around the house instead of being
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:47.680]   a responsible house.
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:48.920]   You don't want to go on windows season yet?
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:49.920]   I don't know.
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:50.920]   You're at the end.
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.840]   Don't get me started about the gutters.
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.560]   You know, look at those leaves out.
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.560]   Get a go back.
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.560]   Check the boiler.
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.560]   Make sure you got oil in there.
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.560]   Oh my God.
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.560]   Oh my God.
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.920]   I mean, this is the, I become a snowboard.
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.880]   I'm, I'm, I'm, I've had it.
[00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:06.880]   Snowboy.
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:07.880]   I had it.
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.120]   And also Alex Lindsay from 090 media and office hours at office hours.
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.120]   Hello.
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.120]   Hello.
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.120]   Hello.
[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:21.520]   I'm on the map today because zoom is like barfing some global zoom.
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.840]   Today use Facebook app login.
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.160]   I think they got, they got, they got Facebook's engineers on over there to help work on the
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.360]   network and well, DNS.
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.560]   Oh my God.
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.000]   It's broken.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   It's broken.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.640]   Actually a lot of the five hour Facebook out of yesterday not only brought down Facebook
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.600]   Instagram and WhatsApp, but a lot of excess traffic as Cloudflare talked about in their
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:43.600]   blog.
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.320]   Well, no, Facebook's not down.
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.320]   It can't be down.
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.760]   Can't be down and they keep hitting it.
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:48.760]   Can you imagine Leo?
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.040]   It's like if you deleted every name from your contact list and no longer knew what was so
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.760]   good with what number you just started pressing every number to see what it is.
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.880]   That happens to the phone lines.
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.240]   I wonder, I wonder how many new routers there were bought.
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.240]   You know, oh yeah.
[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.240]   Can't be, can't be.
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.240]   Can't be.
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.360]   What a great, what a great divide between like the haves and the have nots where the,
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.840]   and all of, and all of Facebook, there were the people that were like, yay, it's a snow
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:12.840]   day.
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.160]   I get to go home and not do anything.
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.440]   And then there were the other people at Facebook like, oh crap, this is going to ruin
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.840]   my entire day, my entire week, and my entire month.
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:26.040]   And I guess I'm not going to see my family this month because we have to fix all of this.
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.280]   It really wasn't.
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.800]   It's, it's something that happens all the time.
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.000]   Unfortunately, BGP router information.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Incorrectly updated.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.200]   I'm sure Steve Gibson will give us a play by play.
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:43.440]   But what was interesting is they essentially took all of Facebook, including internal networks
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.920]   off, which apparently, according to Brian Krebs, meant that they couldn't use their card
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.960]   keys to get into the network center to fix it.
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.640]   We're going, we can't get it.
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:54.640]   We can't get it.
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.920]   What's up is telephony for like two thirds of the world.
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.880]   Like a big world with silent.
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:59.880]   Yeah.
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:00.880]   Yeah.
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:01.880]   Really huge deal.
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.520]   So I forget her name, but there's a really great tech columnist, a tech reporter at the
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:09.280]   New York Times who had a really good play by play, like being in touch with like people
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.880]   who are at Facebook who are like now.
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.320]   And now there's there's talks about which doors can be kicked in and which cur which
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.400]   doors are not all the stuff that it comes down to.
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.520]   I can't get into the office.
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.880]   It's not it's not a question of this really, really complicated.
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.880]   It's like the door is locked and I cannot unlock it now.
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:32.080]   And that's there's going to be a this is why like when there were a lot of problems with
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:39.240]   like launching a vaccination appointment sites state by state by state, that's why like I
[00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:44.360]   was a lot like Massachusetts site was hammered for the first couple of days and unusable.
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.800]   And I had to be really, really sympathetic saying no, this is not supposed to how it's
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:48.800]   supposed to work.
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.880]   No, a lot of other states work fine, but we have you have when you have lots and lots
[00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.560]   of people trying to interact with the same service at the same time, you can do simulations,
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.920]   you can do the math, you can hire the right people, but you don't know what's going to
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.840]   happen until the thing happens.
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:07.880]   Could you hear the scream Renee from Georgia Dows house when her Oculus Rift went.
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:08.880]   Oh, God.
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.440]   Well, no, because it was tempered by her joy of Facebook being down.
[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:13.440]   Oh, yeah.
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.040]   Because it was like it wasn't funny because some of the reaction half the reaction was
[00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.000]   the internet going, Oh, this is peace.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   This is quiet.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   There is no doom.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.240]   I'm sure it's a coincidence that this happened right after the 60 minutes whistleblower piece
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.880]   and just before the testimony in front of the Senate.
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:29.760]   How do you stop the fence does Leo?
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:35.180]   How do you stop the fence does you car you apparently Facebook's response to Senator
[00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:37.840]   Blumenthal was we stopped the fences.
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:38.840]   We stopped everything.
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:39.840]   Stop everybody.
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:41.240]   You will just turn this down.
[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:45.680]   My mind immediately went to the conspiracy theory that Facebook was Mark Zuckerberg said,
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.120]   let's just show them what world without Facebook would be like.
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.720]   Can you imagine he gets so angry, he pulls the plug and then jumps in his supersonic
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.880]   hydrofoil and like Daniel Craig is chasing him across the Atlantic.
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:56.880]   I know the bottom thing.
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:58.560]   There's no evidence that that's what happened.
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.480]   It sure does seem coincidental.
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.760]   The timing is going to the volcano there.
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:04.400]   Yeah, it's interesting.
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.400]   It's the volcano.
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:12.040]   Anyway, that's not obviously an Apple story, but.
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.080]   It's a story of the world.
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:16.560]   Also we love dunking on Facebook.
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:17.560]   I know.
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:24.080]   It makes us I feel bad for every employee that I legitimately all of their like personal
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:25.240]   plans and social plans.
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.000]   They can't they can't go to their kids recitals.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.360]   They can't do that because this is crisis, crisis, crisis and you know that the as responsible
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.960]   as you are, you're thinking somebody screwed up big time.
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:36.440]   I hope it wasn't me.
[00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:40.280]   But on the other hand, you're like, Oh, please suffer a little bit more.
[00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:44.800]   But just please, please, please know that you are not counted amongst God's favorite
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.600]   companies on this day.
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:47.600]   Clearly.
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:48.600]   Sorry.
[00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:51.280]   How badass is it that they went into the server cage with chains?
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.280]   Like was it metal glass chains?
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:58.280]   Like that's every IT person nobody's thought about this.
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:03.400]   You know, if we really screw up the routing, we won't be able to get in to fix it.
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.200]   That is like your worst nightmare.
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:06.200]   That's like a.
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.200]   Is there like a dream?
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.200]   It's every idea.
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.200]   It's dream.
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:14.200]   Yeah, I just I just I just want to know who who had that conversation where it was like
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:15.200]   we can't get in.
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:16.200]   What do you mean you can't get in?
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:17.200]   It's locked.
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:18.200]   Get a chainsaw.
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:19.200]   Here's the company credit card.
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:20.200]   John's home.
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:21.200]   I want you on the plane.
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:25.320]   Well, again, I'm security now talk about this, but really the real question, the real
[00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:32.440]   technical issue is why is it possible even to do this with BGP?
[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:37.600]   There needs to be something in the protocol that that shows you ahead of time what a misrouting
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.840]   is going to do.
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:44.000]   And and prevention within the room, Leo, the key was in the room.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   It's ridiculous.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   Oh my God.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   Like that video.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.480]   It happens all the time, by the way.
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:54.960]   Remember, last year there was an ISP changed his BGP tables and routed all internet traffic
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:56.200]   through a small town in Maine.
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.640]   I mean, it's just it's this should not be possible.
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:08:59.800]   Ancient technology, isn't it?
[00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:00.800]   Yeah.
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:01.800]   Well, it's ancient testology.
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:07.280]   And I think people really need to take it more seriously before they change the BGP settings.
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:08.280]   That's kind of nuts.
[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:10.080]   What could it possibly hurt?
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:14.560]   It's a really has a really has a point that so much of the infrastructure that the entire
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:18.680]   internet relies upon was conceived of and locked down.
[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:23.360]   That when the internet was away for boring professors to send boring text to documents
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:29.000]   to each other in a very boring way, it was not set up to be so robust as to recognize
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.720]   what happens when a billion people across the planet all want to get the same cat picture
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:34.720]   at the same time.
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:35.720]   Yeah.
[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:39.120]   And it's such a the load is just so massive, you know, that that you know, and there's
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.480]   so much flowing that it's really hard to understand.
[00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:45.360]   Like we had another situation where the CDN went under because someone was like putting
[00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:47.440]   in power into their house in the back.
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:49.000]   Oh, hit one fiber line.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.120]   And it's just that you just remember that it just has a chain reaction.
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.240]   You cut a fiber line and boom.
[00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:56.240]   Yeah.
[00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:58.600]   It was gone and it was but it was game right now on Netflix.
[00:09:58.600 --> 00:09:59.600]   Yeah.
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:02.840]   But it was just it was it was it but it just it but it was it wasn't the fiber line, of
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.000]   course, it wasn't carrying it all.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.920]   It's just that it it pushed too much pressure in one place, which then pushed too much pressure,
[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:11.240]   which is how you had the, you know, the great blackout and that's right.
[00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:14.280]   You know, these cascading effects turned out to be, I don't know if you're, I'm really
[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.520]   in the connections and I want you to do a couple of times.
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:17.520]   Yes.
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:18.760]   Turned out to be like one little relay, right?
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:22.920]   Like one little relay failed and it took out all of, you know, New York as a kid in
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:27.920]   New York City, who exactly when the power went out had hit a telephone pole with a stick
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:31.680]   and for a longest time, he thought that he did it.
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:35.400]   He thought I broke the internet.
[00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:37.560]   I broke the power.
[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:40.880]   People set him straight when he was like 40, but then they just yeah, he didn't, they never
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:41.880]   left him there.
[00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:42.880]   35 years ago.
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:45.000]   There's still like seven people with the keys to those DNS servers.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.560]   Like it's just, it's such a weird system.
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:50.720]   Oh, but that system is really over engineered to prevent issues.
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:57.400]   I mean, if you saw the key exchange, it's like a ritual out of an 18th century.
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:58.400]   Yeah.
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:02.120]   Secret society, practically, they're practically wearing hooded robes.
[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:04.840]   I mean, it is a big, sometimes you should see this.
[00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:05.840]   I would see this on it.
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:06.840]   Power run.
[00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:10.520]   Yeah, no, it's really, it's a fascinating actually, but that's over engineered to prevent this
[00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:11.520]   kind of thing.
[00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:13.440]   But that's not the big story of the week.
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.280]   You know what the big story of the week is?
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:17.280]   Windows 11 comes out today.
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:18.280]   What?
[00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:22.920]   Oh, good luck getting a hold of the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,
[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:23.920]   what?
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:25.520]   This is the day.
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:27.520]   It goes to 11.
[00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:33.360]   It's the strangest thing that Microsoft releases a whole new version of Windows and the, and
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.080]   the world collectively goes, huh?
[00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:36.080]   What?
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:37.200]   Well, they got whistle blown.
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:39.120]   I mean, like they should have had better time.
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:40.120]   How would they have known?
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:43.280]   It just, I yesterday, I had a Facebook to hear about it.
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:46.000]   Yesterday I logged into, I have a win.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.840]   You know, my game machine has Windows on it just in case.
[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:52.080]   And I logged in, I logged in once a month to update it.
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:54.280]   And Windows 11 is like, oh, thanks.
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:55.280]   Great.
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:56.600]   See you in a couple of hours.
[00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:01.800]   No, the big story really for us is this is, and it's actually a sad story.
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:06.080]   The 10th anniversary of the passing of Steve Jobs.
[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:14.400]   But I think people who are, you know, Apple fans will always remember that day, right?
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:15.400]   Yeah.
[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:22.720]   I remember I miss, I don't, I don't remember instantly like what day is the anniversary.
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:28.080]   But as soon as like I saw like the, the video on Apple site immediately took me back to
[00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:32.800]   being in my old studio in my old house, trying to keep it together a little bit because my,
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:36.600]   my own parents had just died, both of them, like long illnesses.
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:41.360]   And I remember talking to you and like trying to channel part of the love that our little
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:46.440]   community was putting together about because we, we don't, you know, I had exactly one personal
[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:48.160]   interaction face to face with Steve.
[00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:49.160]   I didn't know him.
[00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:54.320]   I didn't, I can't, we can't pretend that we had a personal connection to these people,
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:59.120]   to a lot of these high profile Apple executives, but they're part of the symphony of your
[00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:05.600]   life. And so when one, one piece of, one instrument is stilled, it affects the entire piece and
[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:07.400]   it feels like a moment of transition.
[00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:12.160]   So this is the way that the community got together in 10 years ago to talk about it in
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:14.240]   a very, very emotional and honest way.
[00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:16.840]   Still, I think something that was quite beautiful.
[00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:18.720]   Let's, we can, I guess I don't know.
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:19.720]   Can we play the film?
[00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:20.720]   Yeah.
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:22.480]   Well, Apple take us down if I play it.
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:23.480]   No.
[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:24.720]   I hope not.
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:27.720]   This is on the apple.com on their website.
[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:30.320]   Let me unmute the sound.
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:32.840]   Actually, is there sound?
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:34.200]   There should be sound.
[00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:35.200]   There it is.
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:36.200]   Let me start over.
[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:37.200]   Your life is just a little bit.
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:38.200]   I'll go back a little bit.
[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:41.000]   And I think, is this the Stanford speech they're playing here?
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   Let's see.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.320]   It's a, it's a mentally of speeches.
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:53.120]   When you grow up, you tend to get told that the world is the way it is and your, your
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:55.880]   life is just to live your life inside the world.
[00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:58.800]   Why not to bash into the walls too much?
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:03.960]   But life, life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact.
[00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:08.360]   And that is everything around you that you call life was made up by people.
[00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:09.360]   It was.
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:11.240]   There were no smarter than you.
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:12.600]   And you can change it.
[00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:13.760]   You can influence it.
[00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:17.880]   You can, you can build your own things that other people can use.
[00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:19.600]   Good evening.
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:23.360]   I'm Steve Jobs from Apple Computer.
[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:25.800]   We're very glad to be here tonight.
[00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:28.680]   I think you always had to be a little different to buy an Apple.
[00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:30.000]   Steve, I'm the original Mac and I can watch.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.480]   And I think you still have to think differently to buy an Apple computer.
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:38.120]   And I think the people that do buy them, they are the people that are not just out to get
[00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:39.120]   a job done.
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:40.120]   They're out to keep the world.
[00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:42.120]   Very famous picture of him in his very Spartan graphic.
[00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:47.480]   What I'm curious to me is it's the most remarkable tool that we've ever come up with.
[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:49.960]   And it's the equivalent of a bicycle for our minds.
[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:50.960]   The Bond back.
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:51.960]   This is iMac.
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:52.960]   The whole thing is translucent.
[00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:53.960]   You can see it.
[00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:54.960]   This was afterwards.
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:55.960]   It's first.
[00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:58.400]   It's to announce today that I'm going to drop the interim title.
[00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:02.040]   And who is the ICBO for a long time?
[00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:03.040]   That's Jenny.
[00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:08.040]   Who is to stand at the intersection of technology in humanity.
[00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:09.040]   That's the beautiful love.
[00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:14.840]   And to make something for people that want to bring this into their lives and use it
[00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:19.520]   for things that make them work creative, not just make them work for doctors.
[00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:22.880]   This amazing device holds a thousand songs.
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:25.480]   And it goes right in my pocket.
[00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:26.480]   An iPod.
[00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:27.480]   A phone.
[00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:30.080]   And of course.
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:31.360]   And an internet communicator.
[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:32.360]   Very famous.
[00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:33.360]   An iPod.
[00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:34.360]   A phone.
[00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:41.360]   I love how the audience is just on the edge where there are seats for that.
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:44.360]   And we are calling it iPhone.
[00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:47.200]   That's a huge smile.
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:50.840]   We have a chance that we stay focused.
[00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:52.840]   And we have to change the industry.
[00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:53.840]   The factory took it over.
[00:15:53.840 --> 00:16:00.040]   To really continue to impact people's lives in some small way for the better.
[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:04.720]   There's an old Wayne Gretzky quote that I love.
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:09.320]   "I skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been.
[00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:15.120]   And we've always tried to do that at Apple since the very, very beginning.
[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:18.000]   And we always will."
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.280]   So thank you very, very much for being part of this.
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:26.520]   Yeah.
[00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:34.040]   Really, no one is better, was ever better at introducing a product.
[00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:38.920]   And while Apple does great stuff today, especially their most recent product, Nounsmerphey iPhone
[00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:43.920]   13, is beautifully done, it doesn't, it's not relying on the one person.
[00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:45.520]   He had such a presence.
[00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:46.520]   Yeah.
[00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:51.200]   That's like a master of his craft and like the iPhone introduction, the Intel switch, those
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:54.240]   were a master of his craft at the height of his game.
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:55.240]   Just so well laid out.
[00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:58.280]   He paused, he waited, he engaged, he laughed.
[00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:02.320]   It was just such, he was so good at commanding that stage.
[00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:06.720]   Because he loved being there, he was so proud of the stuff he was putting out.
[00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:11.240]   I remember that I was at the introduction of the iPad.
[00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:16.000]   And it was, I think, the one, maybe the first one in which he was presenting sitting down
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.800]   of in those really nice big black leather chairs.
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:20.080]   And he was very, very frail.
[00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:23.320]   He was obviously dealing with stuff.
[00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:27.520]   But nonetheless, every time they cut to a video, I couldn't watch the video because I
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:31.160]   was watching him like off stage, but close enough that I could see him.
[00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:34.280]   He was standing, he was watching, he was engaged with the video.
[00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:39.720]   He was beaming because he was like, Oh my God, we spent me and my team spent so much time
[00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:41.200]   building this beautiful thing.
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:42.680]   And I can't wait to share it.
[00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:45.400]   I can finally blab about it to the entire world.
[00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:49.520]   And that was so visible and infectious.
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:54.940]   Right below the video on apple.com front page of Apple, it's entirely, the Apple site entirely
[00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:58.040]   devoted to this statement from the jobs family.
[00:17:58.040 --> 00:17:59.640]   I won't read the whole thing for a decade.
[00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:01.360]   Now morning and healing have gone together.
[00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:04.160]   Our gratitude has become as great as our loss.
[00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:06.120]   Memory is inadequate for what is in our hearts.
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:07.120]   We miss him profoundly.
[00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:11.600]   We're blessed to have him as a husband and as a father.
[00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:20.120]   There's also Tim Cook memo, we could probably read a little bit from that.
[00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:25.440]   The memo sent out to the staff team today marks the 10th anniversary of Steve's passing.
[00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:30.800]   It's a moment to celebrate his life and reflect on the extraordinary legacy he left behind
[00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:35.160]   Steve believe that people with passion can change the world for the better.
[00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:38.160]   That's the philosophy that inspired him to create apple.
[00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:39.240]   And it lives in us today.
[00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:41.480]   Steve was a singular figure he taught us all how to soar.
[00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:46.480]   I miss him and will cherish him always.
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:48.120]   There was a Johnny Ivo in yesterday too.
[00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:50.640]   Yeah, in the Wall Street Journal.
[00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:56.720]   I can bring that up to Johnny Ivo and what he misses most about Steve Joplin.
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:02.600]   Of course, I think there was no closer collaborator in the final years of his life than Johnny
[00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:03.920]   Ivo.
[00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:11.440]   He delivered the eulogy in which he referred to chairman and co-founder of Apple as my
[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:14.400]   closest and most loyal friend.
[00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:18.400]   He's of course since left Apple.
[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:23.480]   He starts his piece in the journal with I have barely thought about Steve's death.
[00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:28.280]   My memories of that brutal heartbreaking day 10 years ago are scattered in random.
[00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:30.160]   I cannot remember driving down to his house.
[00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:32.960]   I do remember a hazy October skies and shoes that were too tight.
[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:37.440]   I remember afterwards Tim and I sat quietly in the garden for a long time together.
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:41.040]   But I think about Steve every day.
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:43.640]   Steve's widow, Lorraine and I are close.
[00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:47.200]   Our families have been close for nearly 30 years.
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:48.280]   That's interesting.
[00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:53.160]   I loved how Steve saw the world the way he thought was profoundly beautiful.
[00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:55.240]   So yeah, then it's a much longer piece.
[00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:56.240]   The fragility of ideas.
[00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:57.240]   Yeah.
[00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:01.680]   He says if they were resolved, they would not be ideas.
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:04.280]   They'd be products.
[00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:07.520]   As thought grew into ideas, however tentative, however fragile, he recognized that this was
[00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:08.520]   hallowed ground.
[00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:11.680]   He had such deep understanding and reverence for the creative process.
[00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:16.120]   He understood creating should be afforded rare respect not only when the ideas were good
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:21.640]   or with secret circumstances were convenient.
[00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:26.800]   Steve focused on the actual ideas, however partial and unlikely.
[00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:30.080]   I think that they had a meeting of the minds, didn't they?
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:35.600]   They had almost an electric back and forth that made the two of them made stuff that
[00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:38.240]   was better than either one could make by themselves.
[00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:40.000]   It was quite a synergy.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   Same wavelength.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   Yeah.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   It's interesting.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.840]   He says Lorraine and I are at last working together.
[00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:51.440]   Here's a picture of Lorraine Jobs and Johnny Ive.
[00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:53.600]   It's a beautiful picture.
[00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:59.440]   Lorraine of course has become quite a philanthropist.
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:04.760]   So Steve's last words were to me were that he would miss talking together.
[00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:06.360]   I was sitting on the floor next to his bed.
[00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:09.040]   My back against the wall after he died, I walked out into the garden.
[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:13.320]   I remember the sound of the latch on the wooden door as I gently pulled it closed in the garden.
[00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:17.800]   I sat and thought how talking often gets in the way of listening and thinking.
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:20.520]   Perhaps that's why so much of our time together was spent quietly.
[00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:25.760]   I miss Steve desperately and I will always miss not talking with him.
[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:31.080]   Quite beautiful tribute from Johnny Ive.
[00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:39.640]   Ten years, we talk enough about how Apple's done after Steve and all of that.
[00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:42.520]   But I think it's appropriate on this, the 10th anniversary of his death.
[00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:48.480]   He was young, 56 years old, to talk a little bit about our memories and thoughts of him.
[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:53.360]   He was aware that with Apple he was building a cathedral, which was like in the olden days
[00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:58.120]   where the architect and the first planner would know that this is going to take so long
[00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:02.840]   to build that I will not live to see the final stone being set in place.
[00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:06.640]   I think that part of his pride in Apple was making sure that this company that he had
[00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:11.040]   co-founded, that he had put so much of his personal stamp on, making sure that he was
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:14.920]   hiring the right people, instituting the right culture, putting the right infrastructure
[00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:20.000]   inside the company to make sure that that culture is taught and shared amongst senior
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:25.240]   executives that this thing would go on and still be recognizably Apple and not just be
[00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:29.120]   "Okay, well technically speaking, we're making Mac and Toches, technically speaking, we're
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:34.400]   still making iPhones, but this is a financial company that dabbles in hardware or this
[00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:37.880]   is a services company that occasionally does a health product because they thought that
[00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:43.040]   it was a fun enterprise to get into, that it will always be his race achievement, a company,
[00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:46.120]   not any specific thing he ever made."
[00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:52.880]   I think that what Apple is doing now is less crazy than it was when they got started,
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:57.300]   but creating a system that they have so much control over that, so insular, is generally
[00:22:57.300 --> 00:22:59.120]   something that doesn't work.
[00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:06.040]   They were told that over and over and over again, that the approach that they took of
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:09.160]   not having a lot of other people building a bunch of stuff for them and they're becoming
[00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:16.040]   in many ways more that way than less that way because they can.
[00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:20.640]   But when he took it on, there was no guarantee that it was going to work.
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:22.520]   In fact, it was probably not.
[00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:29.000]   It was almost without someone like him, without that singularity and focus and the ability
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.880]   to keep that moving.
[00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:35.440]   That's why I know almost no other company tries to do that because it's an almost impossible
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:36.520]   cliff.
[00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:41.600]   He got that idea from Alan Kay, who was really an amazing visionary.
[00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:43.760]   Xerox Park became an Apple.
[00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:46.080]   I think he's still an Apple fellow.
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:48.240]   He's one of the most inspirational people in technology.
[00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:52.200]   It was Alan Kay who said people who are really serious about software should make their own
[00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:53.760]   hardware.
[00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:58.600]   I think Steve took that to heart.
[00:23:58.600 --> 00:23:59.920]   Maybe he turned it around the other way.
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:04.080]   People who make hardware should make their own software, but either way, that's Apple's
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:05.080]   part.
[00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:07.680]   It's incredibly hard to do.
[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:10.640]   It's incredibly hard to do what they're doing.
[00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:15.360]   When it works, you are in a completely different place.
[00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:19.240]   That's what we're seeing with the M1s and with a lot of those tight systems.
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:24.160]   It becomes almost impossible to compete with because if you can get to the scale that you
[00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:29.640]   need to get to, to do that, it becomes really formidable because you create your own weather
[00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:30.640]   system.
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:36.200]   Of course, Steve led the charge moving from the Motorola 68000 to PowerPC and then from
[00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:37.760]   PowerPC to Intel.
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:40.400]   I wonder if he even contemplated.
[00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:46.440]   He must have, but it just took a long time for Apple to build its own expertise.
[00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:49.160]   They bought PA risk that I think he was involved in that.
[00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:50.160]   PSME.
[00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:51.160]   PSME.
[00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:58.680]   I suspect that maybe was a distant dream for him, but now when Tim Cook has become a reality.
[00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:03.480]   A lot of ways, if you talk to some of the folks that were there in the 90s when he took
[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:06.600]   over, he put out a lot of fires really fast.
[00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:10.680]   Apple was going to hit the ground.
[00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:12.400]   The engines were on fire.
[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:13.400]   They were almost back to the plane.
[00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:22.680]   The plane was going down and he came in and did a near, it's like being down 22 points
[00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:26.080]   in the fourth quarter with five minutes left and he just kept scoring.
[00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:30.440]   But it was like you couldn't miss a single play and for Apple to survive.
[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:35.080]   He did all the things that needed to get done to turn it around.
[00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:41.200]   I don't think they considered it stable until the iPhone.
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:45.200]   The iPhone came only 10 years after they were going to go bankrupt.
[00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:47.560]   I'm sorry, am I interrupting?
[00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:48.560]   PSME.
[00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:52.200]   We all have so much to talk about sometimes.
[00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:55.680]   What I wanted to get in was that, yeah, I think that's part of what restored confidence
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:58.880]   in Apple, that there was somebody who was making decisions and sticking with them.
[00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:00.440]   There was somebody who had a plan.
[00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:04.760]   They weren't just flailing about saying, "Oh, well, what if we get max sold by Sears?
[00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:11.080]   What if we have an entire product line which is just rebranded Macintosh's but they can
[00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:13.440]   only be sold in a line of stores?"
[00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:17.960]   One of the first decisive things he did was to say, "Here is from a time where there
[00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:21.200]   was a book, almost I have a copy of one of them."
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:25.720]   There was a book this thick just explaining all the different kinds of Macintosh's that
[00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:28.720]   are being sold under all kinds of different names.
[00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:31.160]   He turned it into a 2x2 grid.
[00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:34.720]   We have a consumer desktop.
[00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:36.520]   We have a professional desktop.
[00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:38.200]   We have a consumer laptop.
[00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:39.840]   We have a professional laptop.
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:42.960]   That's our entire line.
[00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:48.880]   It energized not only resort faith in people who were investing in the company, who were
[00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:50.800]   going to be buying hardware for the company.
[00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:53.480]   It was also a lighting a firearm to the people working for a company.
[00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:58.320]   Knowing that, again, if he's decided to cancel this project, it's not because he's, again,
[00:26:58.320 --> 00:26:59.880]   flailing about saying, "Well, I got to do something.
[00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:01.520]   I have to show a strong hand."
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:04.960]   It's because there is a plan to save this company.
[00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:07.320]   Now there's a target to work for.
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:11.240]   Not just simply, "Let's just keep running the clock and seeing what happens."
[00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:17.040]   This is why Renee and I were talking before the show about all these really interesting
[00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:23.040]   devices that Blackberry put out and HP put out, but then withdrew two or three months
[00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:25.880]   later because of total lack of faith.
[00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:30.440]   That's the sort of thing that demoralizes the staff saying that we've got the funds to
[00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:33.800]   make this product, but we have no idea whether management thinks this is important for the
[00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:35.240]   company or not.
[00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:38.840]   Maybe there will be some sort of a change in the tea leaves that will cause them to cancel
[00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:43.080]   our entire project on the most absurd of notes.
[00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:47.080]   We're asked if you're working for Apple under Steve Jobs, now you know that look, we have
[00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:49.480]   pared down the product line to exactly this.
[00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:50.960]   This means that this is a priority.
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:51.960]   It might succeed.
[00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:55.960]   It might fail, but the head of the company thinks that this is important for the development
[00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:56.960]   of the company.
[00:27:56.960 --> 00:28:00.800]   That's what puts your shoulder to the wheel even tighter than you would if you felt as
[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:03.080]   though you were on a sinking ship.
[00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:11.000]   Even then, sometimes to my own frustration, they would change what was important and really
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.800]   dance with what was available to them.
[00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:17.080]   If you look at when Apple really got when Final Cut started going down the path, Apple
[00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:19.800]   started investing more in things like Shake.
[00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:23.600]   They're really thinking this is going to be a core part of our product until the iPod
[00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:24.600]   took off.
[00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:28.720]   Then they said, "Okay, well, this is going to be a smaller part of our product."
[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:30.800]   Eventually, discontinued it.
[00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:35.600]   You could tell that something they had decided was going to be popular and then it just didn't
[00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:39.320]   turn out that way for them.
[00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:44.200]   They were willing to dance with the market as well as be sure what they want to do.
[00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:45.720]   It's really hard to do both.
[00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:53.080]   Here's Steve on the Apple product matrix strategy we're talking about.
[00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:57.600]   When we got to the company a year ago, there were a lot of products.
[00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:03.120]   These were the product platforms, 15 product platforms, and a zillion variants of each
[00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:04.240]   one.
[00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:06.440]   I couldn't even figure this out myself.
[00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:07.880]   After about three weeks.
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:12.280]   I said, "How are we going to explain this to others when we don't even know which products
[00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:14.600]   to recommend to our friends?"
[00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:19.480]   If we had four great products, that's all we need.
[00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:22.920]   As a matter of fact, if we only had four, we could put the A team on every single one
[00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:23.920]   of them.
[00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:29.400]   If we only had four, we could turn them all every nine months instead of every 18 months.
[00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:34.560]   If we only had four, we could be working on the next generation or two of each one as
[00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:39.000]   we're introducing the first generation.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.080]   That's what we decided to do, to focus on four great products.
[00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:54.480]   That's the consumer, business, desktop, and laptop that you were talking about, Andy.
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:59.200]   There are a number of quite a few books about Steve Jobs, obviously.
[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:04.840]   I'm sure most people will go to the Walter Isaacson book.
[00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:09.560]   That's the definitive biography, the one that Steve cooperated most with.
[00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:11.480]   Actually, I think a better book.
[00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:12.480]   This is my...
[00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:13.480]   Yeah, agreed.
[00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:18.880]   Yeah, Brett Schlenler and Rick Tetselli, who had covered Apple when they were at the
[00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:24.560]   Seattle Times, wrote a book about his transformation.
[00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:28.200]   When he was at Apple the first time, he was a little bratty.
[00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:31.520]   A little unfocused.
[00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:33.080]   There's some really...
[00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:36.360]   The book starts with a scene where he's in tears.
[00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:38.480]   He's so upset.
[00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:46.000]   But he matured by leaving Apple by running next, running Pixar, which made him a lot of money.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   Would you want for like 10 million dollars?
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   Yeah.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.880]   There's a long story, an interesting story there about the politics of that, but he's
[00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:56.720]   certainly benefited from that.
[00:30:56.720 --> 00:31:02.160]   In becoming Steve Jobs, it talks about how he learned how to be a CEO, and so that when
[00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:08.040]   he came back in 1997 or '96, he was a changed man.
[00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:12.360]   So, this is really a good book if you want to understand the two Steve Jobs.
[00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:13.360]   It really were.
[00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:17.440]   It's called Becoming Steve Jobs, the evolution of a reckless upstart into a visionary leader.
[00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:18.440]   You like this too, Renee?
[00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:19.440]   You agree?
[00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:21.120]   Yeah, it's way better.
[00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:22.480]   I think the Isaacson book kind of...
[00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:24.520]   He didn't focus on what I wanted to know about Steve.
[00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:27.680]   It was a bunch of ancillary things that Steve Jobs wasn't famous for.
[00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:31.120]   I guess some of those details can be interesting, but I wanted to know about next.
[00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:33.200]   There's nothing about next in that entire book.
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:34.200]   I feel like Isaacson was...
[00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:35.840]   I feel like this one so much.
[00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:37.520]   Isaacson was led by Steve, right?
[00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:39.880]   I think the Isaacson book was...
[00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:41.520]   But Apple wasn't happy with it either.
[00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:43.880]   I don't think anybody was happy with the way I think it was the book.
[00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:44.880]   Yeah, really interesting.
[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:45.880]   Yeah.
[00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:46.880]   It's worth perspective.
[00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:47.880]   It's worth reading.
[00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:49.680]   There's great anecdotes.
[00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:50.680]   Absolutely.
[00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:52.320]   Ken Kishinde is great too.
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:56.960]   He did creative selection about working with and pitching to Steve Jobs and Apple's process,
[00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:59.680]   a relentless process of whittling things down.
[00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:01.000]   Steve's like, "Why are there two of these?"
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   Just pick one.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:09.680]   It's a brilliant book on Apple's whole cultural process during the Steve Jobs era.
[00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:19.920]   I just want to run over and get the Isaacson book because Steve had been looking down
[00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:22.160]   on us from the shelf over here for...
[00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:23.160]   From on high?
[00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:24.160]   I don't know.
[00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:30.320]   Since we moved into this studio, that great iconic picture of Steve contemplating with
[00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:32.160]   his hand on his chin.
[00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:35.760]   Yeah, read them all.
[00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:37.360]   Why not read them all?
[00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:41.320]   But I think becoming Steve Jobs, if you're interested in how he...
[00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:44.240]   Because he had this horrible reputation.
[00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:49.120]   Alex, you're very familiar with it because I think you experienced it firsthand.
[00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:54.120]   But it wasn't me being brash at the time.
[00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:55.800]   I mean, I was much younger then.
[00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:58.400]   And being more demanding.
[00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:01.600]   And he didn't do anything particularly mean.
[00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:03.360]   Just stop talking to me.
[00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:07.600]   It was like, "We wish to be fair."
[00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:10.400]   And so Apple is a lot of employees' greatest dream.
[00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:14.400]   Please, let Steve Jobs never talk to me and never know my name.
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:17.840]   Well, the big lesson there was also that...
[00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:21.040]   And pretty much everyone that I had been talking to at Apple because I had started pretty much
[00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:25.200]   at the top of Apple talking to Steve and then him handing me to other people that work
[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:26.880]   on a project.
[00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:29.160]   And the project wasn't going as fast as I thought it should.
[00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:30.920]   I was trying to push it forward.
[00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:36.160]   Anyway, but then everyone around that I had been talking to disappeared to.
[00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:38.280]   Like, it was just like, "Yeah."
[00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:40.320]   And then I learned very quickly at Apple.
[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:44.360]   And in pretty much all companies is you want to stay away from the top of the pyramid
[00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:47.960]   as much as you possibly can and just work with people that are doing what they need to get.
[00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:54.280]   Even doing what they need to do and make lots of friends and not at the top if you can avoid it.
[00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:58.680]   Because it's just if you turn that the wrong direction, it's bad.
[00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:04.600]   So anyway, but it was really an eye-opening experience for me though.
[00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:06.000]   The fact that when he talks about...
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:10.440]   Johnny and I have talked about curiosity and that article and how he was really passionate
[00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:14.200]   about those things and how it started the conversation that started with me and Steve Jobs
[00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:15.960]   was over email.
[00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:21.000]   And they just released the iMac and I had just finished working on Star Wars.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:25.080]   And I gathered a bunch of folks together that said that they'd be willing to teach kids
[00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:32.440]   how to make movies, a bunch of folks from Lucasfilm and ILM to teach kids how to make movies with iMovie.
[00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:35.320]   And I said, "I just sent a real quick tiny..."
[00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:38.440]   I figured he probably read emails the way I do, which is if they're longer than six lines,
[00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:39.880]   I never get to them.
[00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:45.640]   And so I wrote this really short. What do you think of having a bunch of folks that just finished
[00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:52.040]   Star Wars, teach kids how to make movies? And I got an email back on a Saturday night in like 10 minutes
[00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:53.720]   said, "Tell me more." And then I wrote along.
[00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:55.080]   That's awesome.
[00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:58.120]   And then it was like, "Here are the people you need to talk to and you introduce me."
[00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:03.960]   And then boom, it was all moving. It didn't turn out, but it was just really like someone who really
[00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:05.880]   was trying to figure it out.
[00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:09.720]   He was engaged. There's no question at all about that.
[00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:16.280]   Steve will miss you 10 years in, who knows what he would have accomplished later in life,
[00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:19.400]   but he certainly did an awful lot in those 56 years.
[00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:22.840]   Yeah. We'll take the universe.
[00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:28.680]   Yeah. We'll take a little break, come back with more. There's other Apple news.
[00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:34.760]   Our show today brought to you by our crowd, all around the world tech companies are innovating,
[00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:41.560]   driving returns for investors. And I bet a few of us are sitting there on the sidelines thinking,
[00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:46.040]   "Golly, am I missing the boat on some of the most interesting
[00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:51.000]   companies in the world? Our crowd is an interesting company."
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:57.160]   Essentially, they're a venture capital company. They're venture capitalists, accredited investors,
[00:35:57.160 --> 00:36:05.160]   who analyze companies across the global private market. These are pre-IPO companies
[00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:10.040]   and they select those with the greatest growth potential for their own investment,
[00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:16.200]   but they also, and this is what's really interesting about our crowd, give you a chance to invest.
[00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:23.640]   It's in a lot of sectors from personalized medicine, cybersecurity, robotics, quantum computing.
[00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:29.960]   Our crowd is identifying innovators, whether they're little startups and garages or in state-of-the-art
[00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:37.800]   labs, so that you can invest when the growth potential is the greatest early. Getting in early
[00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:43.800]   is really the key. Our crowd's accredited investors have already invested over a billion dollars in
[00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:51.000]   growing tech companies. Many of their members have benefited from the 46 IPOs or sale exits of
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:56.200]   their investments. So you're getting in before the IPO or the exit. Now you could truly diversify
[00:36:56.200 --> 00:37:02.440]   your portfolio by investing early in innovative private market companies at our crowd.
[00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:09.160]   Now, I want to explain, and you should go to our crowd.com/macbreak to find this out. You need to be what
[00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:15.080]   U.S. calls accredited investor. You could do this anywhere in the world, but each country
[00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:21.560]   has different rules. So when you sign up at our crowd, it will ask you what country you're in,
[00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:29.080]   and then say, "Okay, these are the rules for being an accredited investor." You can participate in
[00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:34.600]   single company deals for as little as $10,000 once you are accredited, or you can buy into our
[00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:39.560]   crowd's funds because they also do funds for as little as $50,000. A minimum of $10,000 is
[00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:45.960]   required to invest. Investment terms may vary depending on where you invest. For more information,
[00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:50.680]   when you go to the site and input the country you're investing from, you'll find out what you need
[00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:58.520]   to know about the restrictions in that country. But if you understand investing, I think these
[00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:05.320]   accreditation rules are set up to keep innocent investors from getting involved. But if you are
[00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:10.840]   sophisticated, you know you have a portfolio, you're already investing, and you've always thought,
[00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:16.760]   "How can I crack into this market? This is the way to do it." And by the way, they're investing too.
[00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:23.240]   So they really put their money where their mouth is. Join the fastest growing venture capital investment
[00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:27.640]   community. It's a really interesting idea. And when you look at the exits they've had,
[00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:32.520]   I think you'll see there's a real opportunity. Ourcrowd.com/macbreak.
[00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:37.640]   It's not for everybody, but if it's for you, this is really the place to be.
[00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:44.920]   Ourcrowd.com/macbreak. We thank them so much for... I think that they think, and I think they'll
[00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:49.480]   probably write the Macbreak audience as an affluent group of people with savvy people who might be
[00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:54.760]   looking to expand their investments. So we thank them for supporting us. And we thank you, if you are
[00:38:54.760 --> 00:39:03.080]   one of those people, for using that address that they know you saw it here. Ourcrowd.com/macbreak.
[00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:10.520]   I skipped the iPhone 13. I think I'm even more likely to skip the Apple Watch 7,
[00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:16.840]   which pre-orders start this Friday, and you'll be getting it. If you order at 5am Pacific on Friday,
[00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:21.560]   you might have a shot at getting it October 15. Much delayed from the announcement because I
[00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:27.400]   think of the chip shortage, but also rumors were that the screen was tricky to make. It's bigger,
[00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:30.920]   and it kind of wraps around a little bit more. But over the next...
[00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:34.040]   Well, first, Leo, we need you to turn in your six-color card to Jason Snell.
[00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:37.320]   I know, I know. I skipped two Apple products in a row.
[00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:43.560]   And it's funny because I love the Apple Watch, but I have to point out the new one has the same chip
[00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:51.800]   in it. It's close. It's not the same system in package, but it's the same chipset, the same A13
[00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:56.840]   core on the chips that the CPU did not change. So faster, though, but more efficient, maybe.
[00:39:56.840 --> 00:40:02.680]   Yeah, different display drivers and different power regulation circuitry. The thing is,
[00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:08.040]   unlike the iPhone, which is saturated, which almost all customers now are upgrade and some
[00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:12.840]   switching customers, the vast majority of iPhone owners still don't have an Apple Watch. And so,
[00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:17.560]   when Apple is marketing this, nobody expects you to get a new iPhone every year. It's only people
[00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:22.600]   like us or people on subscription plans or people who are really affluent who get new iPhones every
[00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:26.440]   year just because it's what they do. Most people don't. I think it's 80% of people don't buy new
[00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:30.200]   iPhones every year. They buy them every three to five years. But the vast majority of people
[00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:34.440]   don't have an Apple Watch. So instead of targeting Apple Watch owners, which are really small,
[00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:39.080]   Apple just wants every year to whittle a little bit away of the things that are preventing people
[00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:43.480]   from getting an Apple Watch. And full autonomy is obviously the big one because then you wouldn't
[00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:46.840]   even have to have an iPhone to get an Apple Watch. They're not quite there yet because it's
[00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:50.760]   cellular technology and a bunch of other things aren't in place. But they're adding things like
[00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:57.320]   resistance, like crackproofing and dust, egress protection and things like that. So it's more
[00:40:57.320 --> 00:41:02.600]   resilient for people. So it really is like if you have a very old Apple Watch or no Apple Watch.
[00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:05.400]   And if you've got a recent Apple Watch, you're fine. Just enjoy it.
[00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:10.200]   And I think that I'm probably the target audience for this because I'm still on the four.
[00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:11.160]   Right? So I've...
[00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:12.600]   Are you deaf, my answer? Yeah.
[00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:16.120]   I skipped a couple of years in my... But I think that that's the whole point is that coming out
[00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:20.920]   with every year just lets you decide when on the carousel you want to get on and off and
[00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:25.160]   everything else. I think getting on every time. I just decided there wasn't enough. I kept on
[00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:29.720]   looking at like, do I really need another one? I think this one's just fine. The stopwatch or
[00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:33.720]   the countdown clock and the alarm. I didn't get the last one. I just wanted always on.
[00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:38.040]   And I got that with the five so I didn't get the six. And I'm totally happy with the five still.
[00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:39.560]   Yeah. Yeah. So I'm...
[00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:47.000]   Bigger screens, 41 and 45 millimeters, softer, more rounded edges, unlike the rumored renders.
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:48.360]   The numbers are a bit of a lie though.
[00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:52.920]   Oh really? Because yeah, so they wanted to make the screens as big as they could without
[00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:56.440]   making the casing any bigger. And it turned out they had to make it a millimeter bigger. But the
[00:41:56.440 --> 00:42:04.200]   screens are like 20% bigger than the 456 and 50% bigger than the 0123. And they got the...
[00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:07.240]   Because of smaller borders. Smaller borders.
[00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:12.200]   Yeah. And getting the display drivers and everything is put into those tiny little borders.
[00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:13.640]   Was the big engineering work this year.
[00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:18.920]   Still always on, of course, more durable, crack resistant. As you mentioned, front glass,
[00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:23.160]   IP6X, dust resistant. And brighter when it's always on inside now.
[00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:27.400]   Right. So like the max nits didn't increase, but the indoor nits for always on. So now like,
[00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:32.120]   if Andy or Alex or I are trying to look at how long Macbreak is going, we can do
[00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:34.040]   way more subtle about it. Yeah. Yes.
[00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:34.520]   Yes.
[00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:37.960]   Strongly urge you not to look at your watch while you're doing this show.
[00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:41.880]   I love that they call that right during the middle of the event too.
[00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:42.360]   Yeah.
[00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:43.160]   They knew.
[00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:46.360]   It was like, no, we're not going to be coy about this.
[00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:49.880]   It was we're not breaking about the wonderful display. We're saying, yeah, we know how people
[00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:53.240]   use watches. We've been at the other side of that table. I both sides of that table.
[00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:59.720]   This is going to be the way it is now from now on, right? The incremental improvements,
[00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:01.960]   because it's hard to make big improvements because...
[00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:02.600]   It's mature.
[00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:04.920]   It's mature. They're pretty close to perfect.
[00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:08.200]   The VR headset and the glasses will get big improvements for like two, three years,
[00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:11.240]   and then they'll be the same thing too. And then the car, and then they'll be the same thing too.
[00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:15.320]   It's like TV sets and cars. Like nobody expects their TV or this, sorry.
[00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:17.400]   Yeah, you don't get to do TV every year.
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:18.600]   It's not.
[00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:19.240]   Or a new car.
[00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:21.640]   But the Alex's point was great. It's like it's a bakery.
[00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:25.080]   Every day they have to make French bread. You don't buy fresh bread every day,
[00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:27.400]   but you need fresh bread when you go to the grocery store.
[00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:31.240]   You deserve fresh bread when you go to the grocery store.
[00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:35.320]   But yeah, I mean, it's absurd when you think about how often we are buying these electronics.
[00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:38.680]   My microwave came with the house, and I bought it.
[00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:38.680]   Right.
[00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:40.040]   I mean, I bought a rice cooker.
[00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:41.240]   But there are new ones every year.
[00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:42.440]   The same one for the last decade.
[00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:44.440]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:48.280]   So Alex, be a good candidate with a watch for it.
[00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:52.440]   Yeah, my watch is the battery doesn't last as long as it used to.
[00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:55.800]   And it doesn't have always on.
[00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:59.480]   And I still am always amazed at how much I do use it compared to.
[00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:06.440]   I mean, I used to have a pretty nice citizen watch that was $400, $500, $600 watch.
[00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:11.480]   And the cheapest watch that I could find that did the things that I needed to do.
[00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:18.440]   And now I have a watch that does all those things that for me costs less.
[00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:21.640]   And I just use it all day.
[00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:24.760]   Like the timers and alarms.
[00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:26.760]   Like I just have this thing like, and now I have this thing like,
[00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:30.440]   if I buy it a subscription, I look down and I go just remind me to cancel this in a month,
[00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:33.480]   or remind me to do this, or remind me to turn the water off in the pool.
[00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:33.960]   Right.
[00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:37.560]   I'm constantly having my watch remind me of things as I'm working,
[00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:40.760]   just because I forget everything.
[00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:41.800]   So it's useful.
[00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:44.760]   Yeah, I'm using any apps.
[00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:48.760]   When they first came out with the Apple Watch, I got the impression they didn't even plan to
[00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:51.480]   update it every year. But that is now the cadence.
[00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:52.600]   Yeah.
[00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:53.160]   Yeah.
[00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:57.160]   And it's tied to the iPhone launch, just like the space shuttle to Starship iPhone.
[00:44:57.160 --> 00:44:57.480]   Right.
[00:44:57.480 --> 00:45:00.040]   And so every year they're updated in tandem.
[00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:06.920]   If you are using an Apple Watch with an iPhone 13 and you've had trouble with the
[00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:09.240]   Apple Watch unlock, I've been using it with iPhone 12.
[00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:10.040]   It's so nice.
[00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:12.120]   Not to have to worry about my mask.
[00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:18.360]   Then I find the phone unlocks now when I raise it, just because I'm wearing the watch.
[00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:23.960]   Apparently that was an issue with some watches and iPhone 13s.
[00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:30.600]   That's why we have iOS 15.0.1, which I still have yet to update.
[00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:32.520]   There are other reasons to update though, yes.
[00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:35.320]   Renee is there a bunch of bug fixes?
[00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:36.200]   Bunch bug fixes.
[00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:37.000]   Yeah.
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:37.480]   Yeah.
[00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:39.880]   So like you get the red release, you get the blue release.
[00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:40.760]   And that's like the blue.
[00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:42.840]   It depends how fast you get it, depending on how bad the red release is.
[00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:45.640]   And Alex always says, wait for the fix for the blue release.
[00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:47.000]   Yeah.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.960]   So 15.0.2 would be the one to get.
[00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:51.400]   Yeah.
[00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:52.360]   If there is one, yeah.
[00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:53.000]   It's all bad.
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:53.080]   It's all bad.
[00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:53.400]   It's all one.
[00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:55.880]   I could go through the list.
[00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:58.200]   Because 5.1 is already in beta.
[00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:00.040]   The second beta, 15.1 is out already.
[00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:02.040]   So they're moving along at a brisk clip.
[00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:02.280]   Good.
[00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:04.440]   Good.
[00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:06.680]   There have been other bugs in iOS 15.
[00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:10.680]   I've seen people complain about the touch screen responsiveness.
[00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:13.000]   There have been posts on Reddit and elsewhere.
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:14.280]   Does this fix that or no?
[00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:18.840]   I believe I've fixed all those initial bugs.
[00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:20.600]   I haven't seen too many complaints since then.
[00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:20.680]   OK.
[00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:23.000]   Good.
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:23.960]   That's good news.
[00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:24.520]   Yeah.
[00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:27.320]   I've had that from time to time with a number of phones.
[00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:32.360]   It's as if they're busy off doing something else when you touch the screen.
[00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:34.520]   They're not going to sign in the window and say, wait for lunch.
[00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:34.760]   Yeah.
[00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:36.280]   And then they go, oh, whoa, sorry.
[00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:37.720]   I wasn't watching.
[00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:41.000]   And usually that's fixed with the bug fix.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:41.800]   So good.
[00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:43.080]   I hope that that is fixed.
[00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:47.320]   If you're having that problem, you might want to look at 15.0.1.
[00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:55.160]   A non-text regular, I guess yearly, review of the new Apple chip.
[00:46:55.160 --> 00:46:57.640]   The A15 is out.
[00:46:57.640 --> 00:47:00.520]   Many, many, many pages.
[00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:02.840]   I haven't had time to read it all.
[00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:04.120]   I read it this morning.
[00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:04.680]   OK.
[00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:05.080]   Good.
[00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:05.560]   Thank you.
[00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:06.520]   That's why I didn't read it.
[00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:09.000]   I thought, I really, really, really, really, really, really.
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:09.800]   I love this stuff.
[00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:13.880]   I mean, Anantek has such a rich, like, from Anant himself to Brian Kluge to Joshua
[00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:16.360]   to Brandon Chester, to Andre.
[00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:19.880]   They just do such-- they should benchmark.
[00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:21.080]   All of us shouldn't be benchmarking.
[00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:23.480]   We have no idea what a pinch mark is.
[00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:24.440]   We download an app.
[00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:25.320]   We press a button.
[00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:25.880]   We--
[00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:27.320]   [AUDIO OUT]
[00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:27.640]   Like--
[00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:30.280]   Uh-oh.
[00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:31.960]   We're losing Renee.
[00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:32.600]   He's frozen.
[00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:33.080]   You're solid.
[00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:35.800]   We moved-- I mentioned moved over from Zoom.
[00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:38.600]   I checked Scooter X sent me the Zoom.
[00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:39.400]   We--
[00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:42.360]   Don't know your name.
[00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:42.840]   It's huge.
[00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:44.040]   It's pretty much what we expected.
[00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:47.400]   He's now hearing me say we lost some of that.
[00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:49.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:50.040]   Oh, sorry.
[00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:52.680]   Yeah, it started all over again.
[00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:53.480]   It started all over again.
[00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:55.800]   We lost a lot of it.
[00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:57.800]   It's pretty much exactly what we expected.
[00:47:57.800 --> 00:48:00.040]   It's got the new generation of Apple cores.
[00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:02.280]   So you have Blizzard, high efficiency cores,
[00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:04.440]   and Avalanche, high performance cores.
[00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:07.560]   Those replace Ice and Ice Storm and Fire Storm.
[00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:09.320]   And I think those names are sort of symbolic
[00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:10.840]   for what Apple's done this year.
[00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:13.560]   They only increased frequencies as a way to increase speed.
[00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:15.240]   There was no new process this year.
[00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:17.560]   They didn't shrink down to like three nanometers or anything.
[00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:19.160]   But the frequencies are higher.
[00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:19.960]   Double the cache.
[00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:23.960]   So these chips are cooler and they can run way more efficiently.
[00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:25.240]   So the efficiency--
[00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:28.200]   The cool thing is they're 10% faster on single core,
[00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:32.200]   20% faster on multi core, up to 55% faster on GP.
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.960]   On the G14 cores, those will decelerate faster
[00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:37.400]   because of the heat envelope.
[00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:40.680]   But they do all that with like phenomenally better battery life,
[00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:42.680]   which is a big deal because the iPhone 12s
[00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:45.000]   were not phenomenal at all on battery life.
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:46.120]   So I think they really--
[00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:47.160]   This is a cold chip.
[00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:49.320]   It's got cold names because it's a cold, cold chip.
[00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:50.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:51.480]   Yeah.
[00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:56.280]   The author, Andre Frumosano, I think, is how you say his name,
[00:48:56.280 --> 00:49:01.720]   says, "The possible reasons for Apple's more moderate micro
[00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:05.480]   architectural changes this year might be a storm of a few factors.
[00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:07.640]   Apple had notably lost their lead architects
[00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:10.920]   on the big performance cores as well as parts of the design team
[00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:15.800]   to Novea in 2019," which was later acquired by Qualcomm earlier this year.
[00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:20.120]   "The shift towards ARM V9 might also imply some more work done on the design
[00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:25.000]   and the pandemic situation might also have contributed to some non-ideal execution."
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:30.040]   We'll have to examine next year's A16 to really determine if Apple's design cadence
[00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:35.560]   has slowed down or whether this year was just a slippage or maybe a lull for--
[00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:38.120]   I think I'd go over the optimistic about ARM V9.
[00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:41.480]   I think ARM was ARM V7 when Apple started.
[00:49:41.480 --> 00:49:43.640]   Apple really pushed them to go to ARM 64.
[00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:45.640]   ARM 64 was basically an Apple ISA.
[00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:47.880]   Nobody else cared about 64-bit at the time,
[00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:49.880]   and Apple got to have their way with it.
[00:49:49.880 --> 00:49:52.120]   And ARM V9, when you read the spec,
[00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:53.560]   there's a couple of things that are interesting,
[00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:55.640]   like the matrix multiplication improvements,
[00:49:55.640 --> 00:49:59.000]   but it really sounds like ARM is backporting everything Apple's done
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:03.160]   with their own silicon for the last four years to all the other ARM licensees.
[00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:05.240]   It's sort of like, "Okay, Apple's really been pushing the pace.
[00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:07.240]   We're going to reverse engineer as much as we can,
[00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:08.680]   give it to you in the Cortex cores,
[00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:11.640]   and then you can license those designs as much as you want."
[00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:15.560]   So I think Apple's already skated to where ARM V9 is going to be in large part.
[00:50:15.560 --> 00:50:16.680]   Andre, also--
[00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:17.960]   Go ahead, Alex.
[00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:21.640]   I also think that this is exactly why Apple used to not put any stats out,
[00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:23.480]   and it still doesn't lean on stats that much.
[00:50:23.480 --> 00:50:28.280]   Is what does the new phone do, as opposed to how fast is the processor?
[00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:33.720]   Because the reality is we're barely using the processor to its maximum capacity almost ever.
[00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:36.440]   It is so rare for us to hit the phone.
[00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:40.200]   I hit the phone ceiling relatively often because I'm doing AR stuff,
[00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:43.400]   so I will figure, "Oh, it's 2 million polygons."
[00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:47.080]   2 million polygons turns out to be where things got to get uncomfortable,
[00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:52.680]   and over 30 megs of texture maps tends to be a little heavy for the phone.
[00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:57.240]   And those numbers are astronomical compared to what you're normally doing with your phone.
[00:50:57.240 --> 00:51:00.040]   So I don't think that the performance really matters.
[00:51:00.040 --> 00:51:05.160]   I mean, I think that the things that it does, like Apple ProRes 422HQ,
[00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:06.840]   which is so exciting.
[00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:10.200]   Which used to be an afterburner card.
[00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:12.920]   Like Apple-- that was one of the biggest revelations to me.
[00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:15.640]   Apple spent a lot of their transistor budget off the main cores,
[00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:17.080]   and they've been doing that for a while,
[00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:19.320]   because there's going to be a thermal limit to what you can do,
[00:51:19.320 --> 00:51:21.480]   even with spikes in a small device.
[00:51:21.480 --> 00:51:25.400]   So the cores are only going to go so far, or just going to cause a brown out at some point,
[00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:27.160]   because the batteries will never get that much bigger.
[00:51:27.160 --> 00:51:28.840]   But they're spending all of those transistors,
[00:51:28.840 --> 00:51:32.520]   and this year they have ProRes hardware acceleration on the chip.
[00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:36.280]   Two years ago, they announced afterburner cards for the Mac Pro,
[00:51:36.280 --> 00:51:39.960]   these huge reprogrammable ASIC cards to handle ProRes acceleration.
[00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:41.800]   Now it's a block on this chip.
[00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:43.400]   And that makes me start thinking,
[00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:46.600]   what if that block is on the MacBook Pro chips?
[00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:48.680]   Then you suddenly have afterburner Mac Pros,
[00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:53.720]   built into a chipset, not a giant card, not a Mac Pro, but like every computer.
[00:51:54.360 --> 00:51:57.000]   And take a side route for just a second.
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:59.560]   Stu Mashowitz, who's my old office buddy at ILM,
[00:51:59.560 --> 00:52:06.120]   posted a comparison between the H.265 and ProRes on Twitter.
[00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:08.680]   If you do search for, I think it's 5 to you, but also,
[00:52:08.680 --> 00:52:12.120]   but Stu put it up there, it's profound.
[00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:16.520]   It's not a minor upgrade.
[00:52:16.520 --> 00:52:19.160]   I was glad that I'd already ordered the phone when I saw it,
[00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:21.240]   because I was like, I think I want this.
[00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:22.840]   And then as soon as I saw they update it was-
[00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:24.360]   Yeah, that's kind of what Andre said.
[00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:25.480]   It's a little video up on YouTube now.
[00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:30.440]   Just because Apple didn't compare the performance of the A15 to the previous generation,
[00:52:30.440 --> 00:52:34.840]   but only the competition doesn't mean that this isn't an improved phone.
[00:52:34.840 --> 00:52:39.160]   And he says, you might take the somber tone of that paragraph wrong,
[00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:41.880]   because there is some massive stuff done here.
[00:52:41.880 --> 00:52:45.560]   As you said, Renee, he points to the efficiency course of the A15.
[00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:48.760]   He says they've seen massive gains this time around.
[00:52:48.760 --> 00:52:49.720]   Yeah, they're not a little anymore.
[00:52:49.720 --> 00:52:52.840]   Yeah, with Apple mostly investing them back into performance,
[00:52:52.840 --> 00:52:57.960]   the new coars showcase a 23 to 28% absolute performance improvement.
[00:52:57.960 --> 00:52:59.240]   This is on the efficiency course.
[00:52:59.240 --> 00:53:00.840]   Of course, you go to the safe power.
[00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:06.040]   Something he says points out that isn't easily identified by popular benchmarking.
[00:53:06.040 --> 00:53:07.720]   This is why we turn to a non-detect.
[00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:09.480]   Oh, yeah, they take performance course, yeah.
[00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:12.440]   Yeah, the large performance further-
[00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:18.280]   This improvement in the efficiency course further helps the SOC improve energy efficiency.
[00:53:18.280 --> 00:53:19.960]   That's why you're getting great battery life.
[00:53:19.960 --> 00:53:23.880]   He also says in the GPU side,
[00:53:23.880 --> 00:53:26.680]   Apple's peak performance improvements are off the charts,
[00:53:26.680 --> 00:53:31.560]   with a combination of new larger GPU, new architecture,
[00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:35.880]   and the larger system cache that helps both performance as well as efficiency.
[00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:36.520]   And I'm going to-
[00:53:36.520 --> 00:53:40.680]   The subtext to me on that is you want to see this,
[00:53:40.680 --> 00:53:46.280]   because the next challenge for Apple is going to make their Mac books and their Mac
[00:53:46.280 --> 00:53:52.760]   pros with high-end GPUs competing with the high-end GPU models.
[00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:55.320]   They don't use these GPUs anymore.
[00:53:55.320 --> 00:54:00.840]   So Apple's going to have to do homegrown GPUs that can compete with the radiance.
[00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:04.600]   And so to me, it's encouraging and not surprising that Apple put a lot of energy
[00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:08.760]   into the GPUs on the phone, because of course, this A15 is kind of-
[00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:11.960]   It's I don't know if it's the same as the M1X will be,
[00:54:11.960 --> 00:54:15.080]   or the big brother or the little brother of the M1X,
[00:54:15.080 --> 00:54:18.120]   but it's definitely that work is going to go into the M1X and the M2.
[00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:21.720]   The M1X will probably be purpose-built, my guess,
[00:54:21.720 --> 00:54:23.080]   because it's got a very strange-
[00:54:23.080 --> 00:54:25.240]   Like from what we know, from what people have been saying,
[00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:26.840]   like Mark Herman has been reporting,
[00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:28.840]   it's only going to have two efficiency cores,
[00:54:28.840 --> 00:54:31.000]   and then eight performance cores.
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:33.720]   So half the efficiency cores, twice the performance cores.
[00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:35.080]   Some people worry about battery life,
[00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:36.680]   but coincidentally,
[00:54:36.680 --> 00:54:38.920]   macOS Monterey is getting a low power mode.
[00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:42.680]   The same year that we're going to be getting these new MacBook Pros,
[00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:45.560]   and then eight to 16 of these new GPU cores.
[00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:48.040]   And they'll probably be based on A14 architecture,
[00:54:48.040 --> 00:54:51.960]   because they were rumored to have been designed for the June release,
[00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:55.000]   and got pushed out because of the micro LED displays.
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.400]   But there's not to say that Apple didn't start the whole ProRes
[00:54:57.400 --> 00:54:59.160]   hardware accelerators for M1X,
[00:54:59.160 --> 00:55:01.960]   and say, "Hey, look, we can put these in the iPhone this year too."
[00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:03.880]   Like they're not in lockstep.
[00:55:03.880 --> 00:55:05.640]   Every one of their chips are purpose-built.
[00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:07.640]   Good.
[00:55:07.640 --> 00:55:08.600]   Super exciting.
[00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:09.160]   We're hoping.
[00:55:09.160 --> 00:55:13.240]   I mean, I was hoping we'd see an invitation from Apple today.
[00:55:13.240 --> 00:55:14.840]   It was Google.
[00:55:14.840 --> 00:55:15.800]   It was Google.
[00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:16.840]   It was Google.
[00:55:16.840 --> 00:55:19.800]   It was Google confirmed the October 19th date.
[00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:23.640]   They did ship, by the way, and not only did Windows 11 come out,
[00:55:23.640 --> 00:55:27.960]   Android 12 came out yesterday, so another big story that we didn't cover.
[00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:32.120]   But so I guess no Apple event on the 12th would be accurate, right?
[00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:34.600]   I'm guessing end of the month beginning of November.
[00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:36.760]   Yes, it's Google's doing it on the 19th.
[00:55:37.560 --> 00:55:40.040]   I'm thinking that rules out the next two weeks.
[00:55:40.040 --> 00:55:42.280]   It's going to be--
[00:55:42.280 --> 00:55:43.480]   And traditionally, these are--
[00:55:43.480 --> 00:55:45.800]   traditionally, the events get spread out a little bit more.
[00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:47.480]   It's a lot to put on a big event.
[00:55:47.480 --> 00:55:47.960]   Okay.
[00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:49.000]   So it usually--
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:52.680]   So there's a whole cadence to that that--
[00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:56.520]   I rarely see two announcements that are closer than two months.
[00:55:56.520 --> 00:55:58.760]   Well, didn't we last year?
[00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:02.040]   Last year, the 2018 was October 30th.
[00:56:02.040 --> 00:56:02.840]   Okay.
[00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:04.040]   Was the Mac event.
[00:56:04.040 --> 00:56:05.400]   And 2019.
[00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:07.480]   Didn't they do three?
[00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:07.960]   Twenty-nine.
[00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:09.720]   No, it was like--
[00:56:09.720 --> 00:56:11.960]   2020, they did three, but those were virtual events,
[00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:13.400]   and they had to do that for the iPhone.
[00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:14.600]   The iPhone got moved to October.
[00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:15.080]   That's right.
[00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:17.320]   And so they pushed the Mac stuff out to November.
[00:56:17.320 --> 00:56:20.200]   But they did do September, October, November.
[00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:21.400]   They did September, October, November.
[00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:21.720]   Yeah.
[00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:23.960]   So, but that's not a template.
[00:56:23.960 --> 00:56:25.400]   That was just a-- that was COVID.
[00:56:25.400 --> 00:56:27.800]   So you think maybe--
[00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:33.000]   October, late October, or maybe early November.
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:33.560]   Go ahead.
[00:56:33.560 --> 00:56:36.520]   If they continue the pattern that they just did with the last launch,
[00:56:36.520 --> 00:56:42.120]   it also means that there's a lot less pressure on when or how to do it,
[00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:43.880]   because you're not doing it in a whole event.
[00:56:43.880 --> 00:56:47.800]   What I mean by that is that I think that the iPhone launch
[00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:50.600]   was what they planned to do with people in it.
[00:56:50.600 --> 00:56:53.640]   And then they just made it virtual at the last minute.
[00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:55.080]   And so it was--
[00:56:55.080 --> 00:56:55.560]   Interesting.
[00:56:55.560 --> 00:56:59.800]   You have basically Tim Cook coming up and announcing movies.
[00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:00.120]   Okay.
[00:57:00.120 --> 00:57:01.160]   Let's watch another movie.
[00:57:01.160 --> 00:57:02.120]   And let's watch another movie.
[00:57:02.120 --> 00:57:04.280]   And I think that's the pattern we're probably going to see.
[00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:08.600]   And the advantage of that is that there's not as much pre-pro,
[00:57:08.600 --> 00:57:10.280]   because when there's a lot more pre-pro in the sense
[00:57:10.280 --> 00:57:12.280]   that the movies get done, but they can get done over time.
[00:57:12.280 --> 00:57:13.560]   There's less rehearsal.
[00:57:13.560 --> 00:57:14.280]   That's what you're saying.
[00:57:14.280 --> 00:57:14.920]   Just less rehearsal time.
[00:57:14.920 --> 00:57:15.320]   Yeah.
[00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:15.800]   Yeah.
[00:57:15.800 --> 00:57:17.560]   So you think even with the live audience,
[00:57:17.560 --> 00:57:19.000]   and maybe this will be a live audience,
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:21.080]   so Tim would come on stage,
[00:57:21.080 --> 00:57:23.400]   but he would still introduce pre-produced movies.
[00:57:23.400 --> 00:57:24.040]   I think it's the right--
[00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:26.920]   I think it's the next step for them is to--
[00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:29.320]   You have someone live that's doing it,
[00:57:29.320 --> 00:57:31.880]   but you are now getting to the habit of taking them
[00:57:31.880 --> 00:57:32.920]   all over California.
[00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:33.400]   Right.
[00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:35.000]   Do we take them all over the United States on the next one?
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:36.760]   Do we take them all over the world on the next one?
[00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:37.320]   Yeah.
[00:57:37.320 --> 00:57:38.040]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:57:38.040 --> 00:57:39.800]   And they can't--
[00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:41.960]   You no longer can keep the same energy that you can do
[00:57:41.960 --> 00:57:43.160]   with a movie on stage.
[00:57:43.160 --> 00:57:45.320]   Should you say, three years it'll be on Mars?
[00:57:45.320 --> 00:57:47.800]   It'll be great, wouldn't it?
[00:57:47.800 --> 00:57:48.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:57:48.760 --> 00:57:50.280]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:57:50.280 --> 00:57:52.200]   I'm going to take this on--
[00:57:52.200 --> 00:57:52.600]   I'm going to take this on--
[00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:52.600]   I'm going to take this on--
[00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:52.600]   I'm going to take this on--
[00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:53.080]   I'm going to take this on--
[00:57:53.080 --> 00:57:53.560]   I'm going to take this on--
[00:57:53.560 --> 00:57:55.800]   I'm going to take this on somebody a mile away on the moon.
[00:57:55.800 --> 00:57:59.240]   And you just float and slowly--
[00:57:59.240 --> 00:58:02.680]   And then it just keeps going.
[00:58:02.680 --> 00:58:06.040]   Mark Gurman says the M1X MacBook Pro is still on track
[00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:07.400]   for this year.
[00:58:07.400 --> 00:58:09.800]   In fact, his phrase in his Power On News letter
[00:58:09.800 --> 00:58:12.680]   is in the next month.
[00:58:12.680 --> 00:58:15.240]   Can I just complain about something?
[00:58:15.240 --> 00:58:18.280]   So I love all my blogger and YouTuber friends so much,
[00:58:18.280 --> 00:58:20.440]   but Mark is a Bloomberg journalist.
[00:58:20.440 --> 00:58:22.440]   When he puts something in a report, he says,
[00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:24.600]   according to sources, when it's actual news,
[00:58:24.600 --> 00:58:27.720]   he is very specific, like where he got it from,
[00:58:27.720 --> 00:58:31.000]   what the vetting that he put into it, what exactly they said.
[00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:32.280]   But then in the news letter, he also
[00:58:32.280 --> 00:58:33.400]   puts in personal opinions.
[00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:36.040]   And you'll say, I wish Apple made it in purple.
[00:58:36.040 --> 00:58:37.800]   But people are so hungry right now.
[00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:39.080]   So there is to be those.
[00:58:39.080 --> 00:58:43.240]   Mark Gurman said the Apple watch is coming in purple.
[00:58:43.240 --> 00:58:45.080]   No, he said he would like it in purple.
[00:58:45.080 --> 00:58:45.800]   And that's the same thing.
[00:58:45.800 --> 00:58:47.160]   He's like, I expect it in the next month.
[00:58:47.160 --> 00:58:48.360]   It doesn't say according to sources
[00:58:48.360 --> 00:58:49.400]   familiar with the situation.
[00:58:49.400 --> 00:58:50.760]   It doesn't say according to three people
[00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:52.760]   I spoke with who were briefed on the matter.
[00:58:52.760 --> 00:58:53.800]   It's just his opinion.
[00:58:53.800 --> 00:58:54.360]   OK.
[00:58:54.360 --> 00:58:55.320]   Let me treat it like this.
[00:58:55.320 --> 00:58:56.440]   We'll make it clear.
[00:58:56.440 --> 00:58:57.640]   Yeah, they don't think sex.
[00:58:57.640 --> 00:58:58.600]   Which is opinion, which is news.
[00:58:58.600 --> 00:59:00.840]   The new Mac book Pro didn't appear at Apple's
[00:59:00.840 --> 00:59:02.680]   September product unveiling.
[00:59:02.680 --> 00:59:06.280]   But it should still be launching in the coming weeks.
[00:59:06.280 --> 00:59:08.040]   Who knows how many that is.
[00:59:08.040 --> 00:59:09.000]   But you're right.
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:10.680]   This is his speculation because he's
[00:59:10.680 --> 00:59:12.600]   adding the sentence Apple typically
[00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:15.240]   does its major new Mac introductions in October.
[00:59:15.240 --> 00:59:17.160]   So stay tuned.
[00:59:17.160 --> 00:59:18.840]   Just like what we just said.
[00:59:18.840 --> 00:59:20.440]   Yeah, we don't know.
[00:59:20.440 --> 00:59:22.120]   But nobody blogs us.
[00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:23.240]   Yeah.
[00:59:23.240 --> 00:59:25.400]   We don't know.
[00:59:25.400 --> 00:59:30.280]   So the new Mac book Pro lineup probably in 2021,
[00:59:30.280 --> 00:59:35.400]   14 and 16 inch configurations, many LED displays.
[00:59:35.400 --> 00:59:36.840]   And maybe all those ports.
[00:59:36.840 --> 00:59:38.680]   That's what everybody seems to say.
[00:59:38.680 --> 00:59:41.560]   And Alex, you'll be happy to see MagSafe back.
[00:59:41.560 --> 00:59:42.360]   MagSafe.
[00:59:42.360 --> 00:59:42.920]   MagSafe.
[00:59:42.920 --> 00:59:43.720]   MagSafe.
[00:59:43.720 --> 00:59:45.320]   MagSafe.
[00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:47.960]   And maybe no touch bar easy, which would
[00:59:47.960 --> 00:59:51.480]   be kind of a shocking admission from Apple
[00:59:51.480 --> 00:59:53.560]   that that wasn't such a great idea.
[00:59:53.560 --> 00:59:55.080]   Wouldn't it be interesting if the new
[00:59:55.080 --> 00:59:56.680]   MagSafe was like the phone or like
[00:59:56.680 --> 00:59:57.880]   some big thing at the bottom?
[00:59:57.880 --> 00:59:59.320]   Won't you set your phone?
[00:59:59.320 --> 01:00:01.320]   Don't.
[01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:02.360]   Please don't do that.
[01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:03.360]   No.
[01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:03.840]   No.
[01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:07.160]   We don't want ducted charging on a 100 watt battery.
[01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:09.000]   That's a bad idea.
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:09.880]   It's a good way to--
[01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:11.200]   It won't be 100 watts anymore though,
[01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:12.840]   because it's not using Intel.
[01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:13.280]   It's looking.
[01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:14.280]   OK.
[01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:15.360]   Well, no, it's still--
[01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:18.040]   I just want ethernet on the power brick, like the iMac.
[01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:21.120]   I'm so torn on the ports because a lot of prosumers
[01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:23.440]   are going to be really happy because they'll have HDMI back
[01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:24.800]   and they'll have SD cards.
[01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:26.520]   But I use CF Express cards.
[01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:28.320]   So now I'm losing--
[01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:30.320]   I'm losing a Thunderbolt port.
[01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:32.080]   And I still have to have a dongle because I'm using
[01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:33.880]   the-- sorry, CF Express cards.
[01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:35.320]   So it's never going to be perfect.
[01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:36.520]   I'm living dongle life forever.
[01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:38.560]   So whatever with the ports, it's fine.
[01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:44.240]   Good article by Jessica, who's a--
[01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:47.920]   I gather a developer.
[01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:50.840]   Always on processor, how fine my works
[01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:52.680]   while iPhone is powered off.
[01:00:52.680 --> 01:01:00.520]   Kind of a surprise with iOS 15, when you press the power off,
[01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:05.520]   underneath the slide to turn off, there's a line that says,
[01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:10.560]   iPhone findable-- here's a picture of it-- after power off.
[01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:11.440]   I hadn't noticed that.
[01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:13.800]   Actually, as soon as I read this article, I said, oh,
[01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:14.840]   let me turn that on.
[01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:21.160]   So that implies that power off is no longer fully power off.
[01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:25.280]   And if you look at the information,
[01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:29.040]   iPhone remains findable after power off.
[01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:31.760]   Find my helps you locate this phone when it's lost or stolen
[01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:33.080]   after the shutdown.
[01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:35.920]   The location is visible.
[01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:39.680]   Now, it tells you this advised orally
[01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:41.440]   because you can temporarily turn off
[01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:46.000]   finding if you want to turn off the phone for purposes
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:50.760]   of Jason Bourne's style hiding from the authorities.
[01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:52.320]   That's actually really interesting.
[01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:54.720]   So it got her thinking.
[01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:58.040]   It's like, what's going on here?
[01:01:58.040 --> 01:02:01.000]   Matthew Green, our favorite cryptographer from Johns Hopkins,
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:07.360]   also says, so I guess power off doesn't mean off anymore?
[01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:09.920]   It means device stays on and does some kind of low power
[01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:11.400]   near field communications.
[01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:14.280]   I'm trying to decide how I feel about this.
[01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:18.600]   I really wish my phone would die 5% earlier
[01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:20.040]   so that it could last a week or two.
[01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:22.160]   I've definitely tried to figure out
[01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:23.640]   what happened to a phone that died.
[01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:26.920]   You know, it was like I have a couple phones
[01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:28.160]   and I was using it for something else
[01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:29.280]   until I put it in some case
[01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:31.320]   and then I couldn't figure out what case it went in and died.
[01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:35.920]   And if it turned off a little early and then had it
[01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:38.360]   and lasted for weeks, you know, in that kind of low,
[01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:40.920]   like you can find me, but I'm not going to do anything else.
[01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:42.360]   It does, but not for weeks.
[01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:44.280]   You can still use it for keys.
[01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:45.800]   Like one of the, it does a bunch of stuff.
[01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:47.760]   Like they don't want you to run out of power, for example,
[01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:49.560]   if you're using your iPhone as a key to your car.
[01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:52.560]   So all the new U1 powered car key features
[01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:54.720]   will keep working for hours after your phone.
[01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:56.520]   And the phone has never gone all the way down.
[01:02:56.520 --> 01:02:58.160]   It always turns off like an around five,
[01:02:58.160 --> 01:02:59.320]   they tell you it's zero percent
[01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:00.400]   'cause they don't want you to worry about it,
[01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:01.800]   but it's really like 5%
[01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:03.200]   because you don't want to completely discharge
[01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:05.080]   and let them lie on batteries for a long period of time.
[01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:07.360]   So there's a bunch of like non-user exposed
[01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:08.560]   implementation details.
[01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:10.280]   - So is it, it's not clear,
[01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:13.180]   but is it using UWB when it's off?
[01:03:13.180 --> 01:03:16.320]   What's it using? - For like eight hours or something.
[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:17.160]   - So it's beaconing.
[01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:19.880]   It's doing Bluetooth beaconing,
[01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:21.560]   even when it's power,
[01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:23.560]   and I'm putting this in air quotes, powered off.
[01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:25.120]   It's not fully powered off.
[01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:27.080]   There's an always on processor doing Bluetooth.
[01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:27.920]   - I don't get that.
[01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:28.760]   So like my phone doesn't do that.
[01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:29.600]   So I'm gonna be able to test it.
[01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:30.440]   One of my turns off,
[01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:31.840]   it doesn't be anyone who just turns off.
[01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:34.080]   So maybe it's not like an alien feature yet.
[01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:35.360]   - Oh, that's interesting.
[01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:37.440]   It's a really good technical article
[01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:40.800]   that explains not just how this feature works,
[01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:43.800]   but also how phones work in 2021,
[01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:45.800]   that it's not an Apple two plus.
[01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:47.840]   There isn't one CPU that gets lit up
[01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:49.400]   and turns everything on or off.
[01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:51.600]   There are, it's a computer that has lots of other little
[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:52.920]   computers inside them.
[01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:55.240]   And the fact that Bluetooth actually has its own
[01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:56.960]   little operating system on its chip,
[01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:59.880]   that it can be a computer that it turns everything off,
[01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:01.880]   except for this one little Bluetooth chip
[01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:04.480]   that can maintain its own status,
[01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:09.200]   and therefore turn the phone into a really, really cheap air tag
[01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:11.280]   for the purposes of location finding.
[01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:13.800]   And also making it clear that if this does bother you,
[01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:17.880]   if you manually turn off Bluetooth while the phone is still alive,
[01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:19.960]   then that will turn off the Bluetooth chip entirely.
[01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:22.560]   And so it will become inert until somebody finds
[01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:24.640]   some other beacon that's happening.
[01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:26.440]   - Really?
[01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:27.280]   - Yeah, really interesting.
[01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:28.120]   - It's interesting because people,
[01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:29.960]   there's a lot of old myths,
[01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:31.760]   like people will still power their iPhone
[01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:34.680]   charge up between 20, 80% thinking that it helps battery life.
[01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:36.880]   But for the last years, every vendor, not just Apple,
[01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:38.680]   they use artificial intelligence for that.
[01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:40.360]   When you plug it in, it won't charge past it.
[01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:41.200]   It'll lie to you.
[01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:43.080]   It used to lie to you and say it was stable at 100,
[01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:44.720]   but it was always discharging and recharging
[01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:46.600]   because you don't want to keep lithium ion.
[01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:48.120]   There's two things that hurt lithium ion,
[01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:50.240]   heat and high charge state.
[01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:52.040]   Or if you store it at zero charge for months,
[01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:53.080]   but that takes a long time.
[01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:54.680]   It can still feel from other things.
[01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:56.560]   But they do a ton of stuff on the power management system
[01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:59.240]   that no human could really micromanage as well,
[01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:01.320]   but a lot of people still feel like they have to do it
[01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:03.440]   and really just plug it in and it'll handle it all for you.
[01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:04.560]   But some people hate the idea
[01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:06.360]   that there's stuff going on behind the scenes.
[01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:08.560]   - Yeah, there's actually, I just saw some software
[01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:12.520]   that is supposed to take better care of your battery than Apple does.
[01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:16.120]   And always my reaction to that is just let Apple.
[01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:18.320]   - Yeah, they don't have the same access level that Apple does.
[01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:19.960]   - Just let Apple do it.
[01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:22.640]   I think Apple knows what they're doing
[01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:24.440]   in protecting your battery.
[01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:26.560]   - That's feeling, I don't know.
[01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:31.240]   - That said, remember Google got in trouble for calling a feature
[01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:33.520]   incognito mode because it was descriptive
[01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:35.600]   and fit what most people would,
[01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:38.360]   what they thought what the feature meant.
[01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:39.600]   But most people would think that,
[01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:40.920]   "No, when I say incognito,
[01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:42.840]   "it means that even Google can't track me."
[01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:45.240]   So this is why it would be kind of nice
[01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:46.680]   if there was something in settings that,
[01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:49.280]   or maybe even when you power down the phone saying,
[01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:51.640]   "Do you want to power it all the way down?"
[01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:53.760]   Meaning that, "Well, that's what we just showed.
[01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:54.600]   "It does do that."
[01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:56.200]   That's exactly what it says.
[01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:57.560]   - And the battery stuff does that too.
[01:05:57.560 --> 01:05:58.920]   Like there's a switch you can turn it off
[01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:00.600]   if you don't want it to manage battery for you.
[01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:02.440]   - But that's what I'm talking about.
[01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:03.440]   Like if I were putting,
[01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:06.040]   if I'm putting a good iPhone, it's a storage.
[01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:09.600]   I've had enough pillow, spicy pillow, so to speak,
[01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:11.920]   in my experience to know that I would much rather
[01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:13.520]   disconnect the battery manually to know
[01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:16.200]   that I'm not gonna have a storage problem.
[01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:18.520]   And it would give me peace of mind.
[01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:21.840]   If I say, "Look, I think you,
[01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:24.480]   "was that line from Parks and Recreation."
[01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:25.640]   - I do not know.
[01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:27.120]   - I'm absolutely gonna do Princess Pride.
[01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:28.440]   Go ahead, Parks and Recreation.
[01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:29.520]   - No, no, no, I'll say.
[01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:31.920]   I went for, I was going for a reference.
[01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:32.760]   - No more modern.
[01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:33.600]   - No more modern.
[01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:34.440]   - Okay.
[01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:35.280]   - But more descriptive.
[01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:38.040]   We're Ron Swanson, so give me all the bacon and eggs you have.
[01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:42.480]   Please, to a diner waiter, say, "Wait,
[01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:45.280]   "I'm worried that what you heard me say was,
[01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:46.920]   "I want a lot of bacon and eggs.
[01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:50.920]   "What I said was, give me all the bacon and eggs you have."
[01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:53.560]   So sometimes, this is a situation where I wish that,
[01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:55.200]   like I wanna tell the phone, "Look,
[01:06:55.200 --> 01:06:57.240]   "I'm worried that you thought that I said,
[01:06:57.240 --> 01:06:59.000]   "I want you to power down the system
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.640]   "so it consumes as little battery as possible,
[01:07:01.640 --> 01:07:03.160]   "even if it's a negligible amount.
[01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:06.560]   "What I said is that I want this to be an absolutely inert
[01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:09.360]   "device with zero battery drain whatsoever.
[01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:12.080]   "And I would love to have that kind of a switch somewhere."
[01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:13.480]   - It's an odd thing, like they, for a while,
[01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:15.240]   they've done, they had this problem
[01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:17.280]   where people were turning off Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
[01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:19.640]   and not understanding why their Apple Watch wasn't working,
[01:07:19.640 --> 01:07:21.080]   why they couldn't air drop,
[01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:23.080]   why a bunch of, like, white continuity broke.
[01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:24.440]   And so they made that change right now.
[01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:27.120]   If you tap them the first time, it just goes gray.
[01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:29.040]   And it disconnects you from Wi-Fi,
[01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:31.440]   but it keeps the Wi-Fi peer-to-peer Wi-Fi going.
[01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:33.840]   And that outraged a bunch of classical computer people,
[01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:35.720]   'cause it's like, it's an on/off switch, it's binary.
[01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:37.360]   It should only have two states, not three states.
[01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:40.160]   And you're like, yeah, but you should see our tech support load.
[01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:42.200]   So those kind of things, and you can turn them off,
[01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:45.720]   but like, do you bias towards the expert user
[01:07:45.720 --> 01:07:47.800]   who just wants you to do exactly what they say?
[01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:51.040]   Or do you bias towards the casual user who's like,
[01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:53.160]   but I didn't mean for this other stuff to stop working.
[01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:54.600]   I just didn't want this anymore.
[01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:56.720]   - Let's take a little break.
[01:07:56.720 --> 01:08:00.880]   More to come with our esteemed panel, Renee Ritchie,
[01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:03.000]   YouTube.com/ReneeRitchie.
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:08.000]   Andy Inako, WGBH Boston, and of course, Alex Lindsey,
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:12.280]   the man, the myth, the legend at officehours.global.
[01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:15.040]   The hardest work in man and podcasting.
[01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:16.240]   You know, what would you call that?
[01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:17.760]   It's not a podcast.
[01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:21.520]   - I don't know, it's like a global water cooler at this point.
[01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:22.360]   (laughing)
[01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:23.200]   - It's like a whole extreme.
[01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:24.200]   - You had a live stream to work stream.
[01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:27.160]   - If you had a water cooler that had all the smartest people
[01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:29.680]   you could think of that do all kinds of different things,
[01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:31.240]   and they're willing to sit there
[01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:33.920]   and talk to you about stuff, that's about what it is.
[01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:37.040]   I mean, 'cause during the two hours of office hours,
[01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:38.440]   it's much more intense.
[01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:42.160]   We go through about 25 questions an hour,
[01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:43.680]   but then the rest, the other 21 hours,
[01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:44.760]   it's just people hanging out,
[01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:45.600]   figuring stuff out together.
[01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:47.840]   - It's such a good idea.
[01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:49.840]   - Hey, our show today brought you by speaking of good ideas,
[01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:52.200]   a really important company I want you to know about,
[01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:56.200]   called UserWay.org.
[01:08:56.200 --> 01:09:01.080]   This is, I think, such an important thing for you
[01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:04.320]   and your company and your website to know about.
[01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:07.960]   Every website needs to be accessible
[01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:10.960]   because every website is a public entity
[01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:13.120]   and because it's just the right thing to do.
[01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:17.920]   Federal ADA, the Americans with Disability Act,
[01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:20.840]   mandates equal access to services for all Americans.
[01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:23.640]   There's actually a well-known Supreme Court decision
[01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:25.240]   on this, Domino's Pizza said,
[01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:27.960]   "Oh, our website doesn't have to be accessible
[01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:30.120]   "because there's a phone number."
[01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:33.320]   And so if you're blind or otherwise differently-abled,
[01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:35.000]   you could just call that phone number.
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:36.920]   Supreme Court said, "No, that's separate but equal,
[01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:38.960]   "that's not legal."
[01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:40.880]   And so you need to be accessible.
[01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:43.800]   And by the way, we shouldn't have to invoke the ADA,
[01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:45.760]   the Supreme Court is just the right thing to do.
[01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:48.560]   There are millions of users who want to use your goods,
[01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:51.880]   your services, your website, who might be left out.
[01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:54.280]   UserWay makes it easy and very, by the way,
[01:09:54.280 --> 01:09:57.600]   affordable for you to fix your site.
[01:09:57.600 --> 01:10:00.600]   UserWay has an incredible AI-powered solution.
[01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:05.000]   AI-powered, because there's a lot of stuff to fix,
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:09.640]   but it tirelessly enforces hundreds of WCAG guidelines
[01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:11.880]   with just one line of JavaScript.
[01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:14.480]   So it's easy on you, it's fast,
[01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:18.200]   it's easy on your users of all stripes.
[01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:20.600]   UserWay can achieve much more than an entire team
[01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:21.440]   of developers.
[01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:23.360]   And by the way, fully customizable,
[01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:25.320]   so you could just put that line of JavaScript
[01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:26.440]   in there and you're done.
[01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:28.960]   Or if you decide, well, one of the things it does, for instance,
[01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:31.320]   is it auto generates image alt tags.
[01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:32.520]   That's so important.
[01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:34.640]   Images, if you're blind, you don't see them,
[01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:35.680]   your screen reader doesn't see them,
[01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:39.360]   it's just an empty block on the page.
[01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:41.520]   So the alt tags, we've done it.
[01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:44.040]   You tape it in a description of it.
[01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:45.560]   UserWay does a very good job
[01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:47.440]   automatically generating a subscription,
[01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:49.080]   that's where the AI, it looks and says,
[01:10:49.080 --> 01:10:50.160]   "Oh, that's a Golden Gate Bridge."
[01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:52.160]   I'll say the picture of a Golden Gate Bridge.
[01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:53.720]   But you can go in and say,
[01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:56.720]   "No, sunset over the San Francisco Bay,
[01:10:56.720 --> 01:10:57.960]   "'cause that's what it means to you
[01:10:57.960 --> 01:10:59.840]   "and that's what you want that picture to say."
[01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:03.000]   It's very easy because it pops up one by one by one.
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.720]   So if you want to modify it, it makes it very easy to do.
[01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:08.240]   Coca-Cola uses it.
[01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:09.680]   Disney uses it.
[01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:12.880]   eBay, FedEx, because they know it's important
[01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:14.840]   that their sites are accessible.
[01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:16.720]   And now UserWay is making its best-in-class
[01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:18.720]   enterprise-level accessibility tools available
[01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:20.960]   to small and medium businesses.
[01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:23.920]   And because UserWay scales to these big companies,
[01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:25.720]   you know you would have some confidence
[01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:28.640]   that as you get big, UserWay is there for you.
[01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:30.600]   It'll scale with you.
[01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:33.120]   An accessible and compliant website's
[01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:34.240]   not only the right thing to do,
[01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:37.400]   it just makes business sense.
[01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:39.440]   And you know one of the big problems is nav bars.
[01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:41.560]   I mean, even sighted people have trouble
[01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:44.600]   with hamburger menus and those three-dot menus.
[01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:48.240]   UserWay remediates complex nav menus,
[01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:50.600]   ensures that all pop-ups are accessible,
[01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:54.120]   fixes vague link violations, fixes any broken links,
[01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:56.560]   ensures your website makes use of accessible colors
[01:11:56.560 --> 01:12:00.800]   without changing your brand's Pantone hue.
[01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:02.960]   It just changes the saturation and luminance
[01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:05.360]   to make it easier for others to read.
[01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:07.160]   And this is all done in the accessibility layer,
[01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:10.800]   so it doesn't change how your site looks to everybody,
[01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:13.640]   just to people using accessibility tools.
[01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:14.920]   And you'll get a detailed report
[01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:17.000]   of everything that is fixed on your site.
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.760]   Works with WordPress, it works with Shopify, Wix.
[01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:22.800]   It's cost effective, it's easy to add,
[01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:24.680]   as little as $49 a month.
[01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:27.920]   It also works with AEM, big stuff, AEM,
[01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:29.520]   Site Core SharePoint.
[01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:31.700]   It'll integrate seamlessly.
[01:12:31.700 --> 01:12:34.200]   It's easy for you, easy for your developers,
[01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:35.480]   and it's the right thing to do.
[01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:37.040]   You'll meet your compliance goals,
[01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:38.880]   you'll improve the experience for your users,
[01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:42.560]   you'll open your site up to a huge number of users
[01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:46.520]   who will be so thrilled that they can access your site.
[01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:48.760]   If you want, you can go to UserWay.org right now,
[01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:51.560]   UserWay.org/twit and check out the free scanning tool,
[01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:54.280]   you'll see if your website's ADA compliant.
[01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:58.360]   We got a little message from the woman
[01:12:58.360 --> 01:13:01.240]   who plays the voice of Siri about UserWay,
[01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:02.640]   I love this listen.
[01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:06.160]   UserWay is trusted by more than one million websites
[01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:09.600]   and 60 million users with disabilities.
[01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:13.000]   Visit UserWay.org to learn how one line of code
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.480]   can make your website accessible.
[01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:18.680]   (upbeat music)
[01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:22.120]   Siri, I love it.
[01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:25.360]   So yeah, we have a different clip too,
[01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:27.160]   'cause one of the clips she says,
[01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:28.480]   so this way I won't say,
[01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:32.200]   "I'm sorry, I can't understand that website."
[01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:34.920]   UserWay can make any website fully accessible,
[01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:37.360]   ADA compliant, it's just the right,
[01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:38.840]   I just want you to do this so bad,
[01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:40.120]   it's the right thing to do.
[01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:42.200]   I know, you know, when we were facing face with this,
[01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:44.240]   we thought, "Oh God, oh, what?"
[01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:47.080]   No, this isn't a chore, it's easy, it's affordable.
[01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:49.160]   In fact, if you go to UserWay.org/twit,
[01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:50.680]   you'll get 30% off.
[01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:53.520]   UserWay's AI powered accessibility solution,
[01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:56.160]   UserWay, USERWAY,
[01:13:56.160 --> 01:13:59.080]   UserWay.org/twit,
[01:13:59.080 --> 01:14:01.840]   making the internet accessible for everyone.
[01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:03.640]   You want everyone who visits your site
[01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:05.600]   to be able to browse seamlessly,
[01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:08.680]   to customize it to fit their needs.
[01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:10.440]   You wanna, and you know what?
[01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:12.600]   Showcase your brand's commitment
[01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:14.520]   to millions of people with disabilities.
[01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:18.040]   As Microsoft said in their Surface announcement,
[01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:19.680]   we're all gonna be disabled someday,
[01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:21.840]   some of us are sooner than others.
[01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:24.160]   UserWay.org/twit,
[01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:25.160]   it's the right thing to do,
[01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:27.560]   it's the best thing to do, you're gonna love it.
[01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:29.120]   We thank them so much, I'm really thrilled.
[01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:30.440]   When they came to us and said,
[01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:32.600]   "We'd like to be on all your shows."
[01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:34.080]   I said, "I am thrilled."
[01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:37.400]   I decided 100% in support of this mission.
[01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:41.520]   Okay, I have an iPad mini,
[01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:42.960]   I don't see the jelly scroll.
[01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:45.560]   I keep looking for the jelly scroll.
[01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:46.960]   What's the story with the jelly scroll?
[01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:47.800]   I just know how to do it.
[01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:48.760]   You have to know how to do it,
[01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:50.280]   well it's not that bad.
[01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:52.760]   Well, so it's like Jesus,
[01:14:52.760 --> 01:14:54.720]   if you open your heart to the jelly scroll,
[01:14:54.720 --> 01:14:55.760]   you will come to you.
[01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:57.720]   So your heart is closed to jelly scroll.
[01:14:57.720 --> 01:14:59.960]   So here I am on Reddit, I'm trying,
[01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:02.760]   I don't know, can you see my jelly scroll?
[01:15:02.760 --> 01:15:03.600]   And so it's like--
[01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:05.440]   So the display refreshes from top to bottom,
[01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:08.480]   but Apple changed the angle of the refresh
[01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:11.480]   on the iPad mini compared to the previous iPad mini.
[01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:14.480]   So if you're doing it perpendicular to the refresh,
[01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:16.480]   you sometimes would be like a slow motion.
[01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:18.320]   Oh, so if I do it like a slow motion.
[01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:19.160]   Which is worse?
[01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:20.800]   I think in landscape--
[01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:21.640]   I think in landscape--
[01:15:21.640 --> 01:15:22.480]   I think in landscape--
[01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:23.320]   I think in landscape--
[01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:24.320]   (laughs)
[01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:28.720]   I fix it, because of the orientation of the appropriate sensor,
[01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:31.680]   it's more norisable and portrait than in landscape.
[01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:35.560]   But also, but the consensus is that you'll,
[01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:37.840]   maybe you'll see it, maybe you won't,
[01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:39.160]   it really depends on,
[01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:41.080]   it doesn't appear to be a defect,
[01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:43.160]   it's just something that happens with all LCD screens.
[01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:44.000]   I've seen it.
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:44.840]   One day--
[01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:46.840]   Other LCDs never bother me, I don't,
[01:15:46.840 --> 01:15:48.280]   you can do it on OLED as well.
[01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:49.760]   Like people are posting it on,
[01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:52.240]   I think Deeter posted it on the OLED iPhone as well.
[01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:53.640]   It is one of those things I guess,
[01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:55.880]   if you see it, then you can't unsee it, maybe,
[01:15:55.880 --> 01:15:57.000]   is that the problem?
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:58.640]   So don't try to say it.
[01:15:58.640 --> 01:15:59.960]   Is it fixable?
[01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:03.080]   No, it's just the way a panel refreshes.
[01:16:03.080 --> 01:16:04.280]   Oh, okay.
[01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:08.080]   Again, it's inherent in the system, so to speak.
[01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:10.640]   And this is, as soon as I was reading about this,
[01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:14.120]   I was thinking that this is one of the drawbacks of Apple,
[01:16:14.120 --> 01:16:16.000]   always making such great products,
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:17.520]   because every time there's something
[01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:19.880]   that doesn't seem absolutely perfect,
[01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:22.480]   the first thought is that this must be a defect
[01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:24.320]   that Apple has to correct as opposed to,
[01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:28.560]   no, this is just the limitations of the technology,
[01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:31.640]   and that no, the fact that we don't consider this a defect
[01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:34.000]   and no, we won't be replacing your iPad because of it,
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.440]   does it mean that we're covering our tracks?
[01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:38.360]   It means that we just,
[01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:40.240]   we're, do you wanna--
[01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:41.440]   - I'm scrolling it wrong.
[01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:42.840]   - Yeah, you're scrolling it wrong.
[01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:43.680]   - You're scrolling it wrong.
[01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:44.680]   - Exactly.
[01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:46.520]   - How about liquid paper?
[01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:47.440]   You want liquid paper?
[01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:49.240]   That was the problem as well.
[01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:50.400]   - I almost took this personally,
[01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:52.640]   'cause I really love the new iPad Mini.
[01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:55.520]   I just really, it's a Dorbs.
[01:16:55.520 --> 01:16:57.240]   It's the right size, it's a--
[01:16:57.240 --> 01:16:59.640]   - It's totes of Dorbs, it's totes of Dorbs.
[01:16:59.640 --> 01:17:02.040]   And so I took it personally, like,
[01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:03.960]   mine does not have jolies.
[01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:04.800]   - Did you yod it?
[01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:05.800]   Did you almost yod it?
[01:17:05.800 --> 01:17:06.920]   - I almost yod it.
[01:17:09.320 --> 01:17:11.160]   - Hey, good on you, Apple.
[01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:13.080]   They've put the button back,
[01:17:13.080 --> 01:17:15.280]   I think they kinda had to,
[01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:18.000]   in the App Store to report scams.
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:18.840]   - Yeah.
[01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:21.980]   - This was, for a while, was ridiculous.
[01:17:21.980 --> 01:17:24.520]   For a long time,
[01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:29.080]   you had to, it would take you,
[01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:31.240]   it would take you out of the site,
[01:17:31.240 --> 01:17:32.960]   you go, out of the App Store,
[01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:34.480]   you'd go to a webpage,
[01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:36.960]   and then when you finally got there,
[01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:38.960]   there wasn't any clearer, this is a scam,
[01:17:38.960 --> 01:17:40.680]   it was report suspicious activity,
[01:17:40.680 --> 01:17:43.800]   record a quality issue, request a refund,
[01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:46.040]   or find my content.
[01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:48.520]   And if you went to, the only obvious one,
[01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:50.320]   report suspicious activity,
[01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:52.800]   then you get redirected to Apple's support.
[01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:56.960]   And you could only do this if you'd fallen for the scam.
[01:17:56.960 --> 01:17:59.760]   You have to pay for it first.
[01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:01.280]   So that's ridiculous.
[01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:03.760]   So now, according to the Verge,
[01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:05.880]   it seems like every free app within App purchases
[01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:08.800]   appears to offer the report a problem button.
[01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:11.920]   You will get kicked out to a website,
[01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:12.920]   you will need to sign in,
[01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:14.720]   but at least you'll be able to say,
[01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:16.800]   hey, this thing looks like a scam.
[01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:22.200]   - Yeah, I really do think that this is part of the blowback
[01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:24.040]   from the Epic lawsuit,
[01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:25.240]   where they were forced to turn over
[01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:27.560]   so much information of internal documents
[01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:29.840]   about how they run the App Store,
[01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:32.760]   that was contrary to all of their defenses
[01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:34.520]   of why the App Store is wholly imperfect,
[01:18:34.520 --> 01:18:38.560]   and they're just out to create the best experience for users.
[01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:43.560]   This was the idea of reporting a scam app,
[01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:47.040]   reporting a bad experience with an app seems to be integral
[01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:50.080]   to the problem of creating a good experience for users.
[01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:51.400]   And it also seems though,
[01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:53.640]   as if with this extra information,
[01:18:53.640 --> 01:18:55.800]   the reason why they didn't make that easy to find
[01:18:55.800 --> 01:18:57.200]   is because you need a human being
[01:18:57.200 --> 01:18:58.840]   to actually process these things.
[01:18:58.840 --> 01:19:00.680]   And the App Store, as we discovered,
[01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:03.160]   is just woefully under human powered.
[01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:05.160]   - Yeah, and of course, we talked last week
[01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:06.240]   about Costa LF theory,
[01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:09.440]   who's problems with his keyboard flick type.
[01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:11.360]   He's become, he's kind of made himself,
[01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:14.160]   and this may have something to do with why Apple doesn't like him.
[01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:16.200]   The scam reporter,
[01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:18.680]   and he's found lots of ridiculous scams on the app store.
[01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:20.320]   - Bless him. - Bless him.
[01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:22.880]   And I have to think he may also have something to do with this,
[01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:27.000]   his tweet in a major reversal Apple quietly added back,
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:30.240]   the reporter problem App Store button in iOS 15.
[01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:34.800]   So, pat on the back Apple, you did the right thing.
[01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:37.160]   - We're glad to see that they did the right thing.
[01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:39.800]   I wish that they would be more public about,
[01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:41.760]   here's a change we made and why it was necessary.
[01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:43.600]   - Why did they take it out?
[01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:46.920]   - Well, yeah, 'cause it also gives you confidence
[01:19:46.920 --> 01:19:48.280]   that they are aware of problems,
[01:19:48.280 --> 01:19:50.080]   they are addressing them as opposed to,
[01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:54.360]   okay, look, if you guys are gonna try to dunk on us about this,
[01:19:54.360 --> 01:19:58.440]   we will make it more visible and more accessible,
[01:19:58.440 --> 01:20:01.720]   but we're not gonna pretend as though we had to do this,
[01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:04.360]   that there was a, we're motivated to fix these things.
[01:20:04.360 --> 01:20:07.520]   So, openness, I know the big company,
[01:20:07.520 --> 01:20:10.400]   Apple can't be as open as I'm sure even they would like.
[01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:15.080]   However, you have to inspire confidence in your customers
[01:20:15.080 --> 01:20:17.720]   and this is an opportunity to inspire confidence
[01:20:17.720 --> 01:20:19.400]   that they didn't decide to take.
[01:20:19.400 --> 01:20:21.160]   - And I think they absolutely have to do it.
[01:20:21.160 --> 01:20:23.960]   I think that they absolutely have to do what they're doing.
[01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:26.360]   I think that the challenge is always that
[01:20:26.360 --> 01:20:28.280]   when you don't require people to buy it,
[01:20:28.280 --> 01:20:30.280]   you can end up with people gaming that system
[01:20:30.280 --> 01:20:32.240]   by something they don't like.
[01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:35.320]   And YouTube has this problem where a group of people
[01:20:35.320 --> 01:20:37.960]   will decide they don't like a certain person.
[01:20:37.960 --> 01:20:41.360]   And they'll all report them at the same time.
[01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:44.120]   And I've had friends, like literally friends of mine,
[01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:47.120]   lose their account for weeks,
[01:20:47.120 --> 01:20:49.160]   because just a bunch of people ganged up on them.
[01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:51.400]   And so, and so, and now one of the--
[01:20:51.400 --> 01:20:52.720]   - That's an automated system.
[01:20:52.720 --> 01:20:55.600]   And Apple is a two and a half trillion dollar company.
[01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:58.040]   They can have humans look at it.
[01:20:58.040 --> 01:21:00.560]   Right, right, but it'll back up.
[01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:01.960]   So it doesn't, it doesn't, you know, anyway,
[01:21:01.960 --> 01:21:02.800]   so the--
[01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:05.360]   - It takes them to the humans of the world.
[01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:08.280]   - No, it's not, it's not, it's not a number of humans.
[01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:11.080]   Like in that article, that idiot,
[01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:13.480]   the idiotic number in there is that,
[01:21:13.480 --> 01:21:16.160]   well, Apple has only 500 and these people have 10,000,
[01:21:16.160 --> 01:21:18.280]   these have 20,000, the skillset for those
[01:21:18.280 --> 01:21:19.960]   are completely different.
[01:21:19.960 --> 01:21:21.320]   Like completely different.
[01:21:21.320 --> 01:21:23.840]   It is the dumbest, you know, stat
[01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:25.040]   that I've seen in all these articles
[01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:26.920]   is people talking about the number,
[01:21:26.920 --> 01:21:30.000]   'cause the skillset that is required to do what Apple's doing
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.160]   versus someone at Facebook deciding
[01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:34.080]   whether someone swore or not, you know?
[01:21:34.080 --> 01:21:36.400]   And so it's just a completely different number.
[01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:38.720]   And I don't know if it's exactly,
[01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:40.360]   I don't know if it's exactly 500 or whatever.
[01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:42.600]   And yes, you can get more, but it's not,
[01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:43.960]   it's not like there's 7 billion people
[01:21:43.960 --> 01:21:45.240]   and you could have any of them.
[01:21:45.240 --> 01:21:47.720]   You know, it is, they have to understand
[01:21:47.720 --> 01:21:50.120]   what they're looking at and it does take time,
[01:21:50.120 --> 01:21:51.280]   you know, to do this, you know?
[01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:56.200]   And anyway, but the issue is,
[01:21:56.200 --> 01:21:58.680]   is that it'll either back up,
[01:21:58.680 --> 01:22:00.200]   it'll be the same problem everyone else has,
[01:22:00.200 --> 01:22:02.560]   it'll back up and there'll be tons of people say,
[01:22:02.560 --> 01:22:04.400]   "Well, I haven't reacted quickly,"
[01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:06.200]   or they'll start doing things like YouTube,
[01:22:06.200 --> 01:22:08.000]   which is they'll turn it off quick
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.400]   and then suddenly, you know, someone loses their app
[01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:11.480]   and then they get upset.
[01:22:11.480 --> 01:22:13.000]   And so there's, you know, I think that's why
[01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.120]   they took it out was just the workflow.
[01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:16.280]   And now I think that one of the--
[01:22:16.280 --> 01:22:17.800]   - Actually, you've made a strong argument.
[01:22:17.800 --> 01:22:19.240]   That's a good point, that makes sense.
[01:22:19.240 --> 01:22:20.600]   - Yeah, so the thing is--
[01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:21.680]   - It's also like, I've--
[01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:23.560]   - You just, skilled labor is not unlimited.
[01:22:23.560 --> 01:22:24.400]   - Right.
[01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:26.560]   - I think that we need to stop thinking that,
[01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:29.000]   is skilled, people who are skilled at doing something
[01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:30.400]   is not an unlimited resource.
[01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:32.360]   It's why, and I work in these companies,
[01:22:32.360 --> 01:22:33.880]   I work with these companies,
[01:22:33.880 --> 01:22:36.240]   I know how hard it is for them to hire people.
[01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:37.800]   Like, you know, and the thing is,
[01:22:37.800 --> 01:22:40.800]   is that that's why all those kids can code and coding
[01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:43.480]   and grow with Google, you know, the reason that
[01:22:43.480 --> 01:22:45.320]   all of those exist and the reason that they're spending
[01:22:45.320 --> 01:22:47.520]   billions on that is because the skill sets
[01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:50.120]   are not unlimited and the schools are not producing
[01:22:50.120 --> 01:22:52.320]   what they need and they're literally gonna,
[01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:54.480]   they wanna get down to when they're 10 years old,
[01:22:54.480 --> 01:22:56.040]   because they're trying to, you know,
[01:22:56.040 --> 01:22:57.440]   they don't care about college anymore,
[01:22:57.440 --> 01:22:58.920]   they just want more people.
[01:22:58.920 --> 01:23:01.240]   So there's this huge sucking sound right now
[01:23:01.240 --> 01:23:03.200]   of people trying to find, you know,
[01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:04.680]   the skill sets that are required.
[01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:06.440]   So we just can't keep on saying that
[01:23:06.440 --> 01:23:08.800]   they could just hire more people because it's not true.
[01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:11.080]   You know, it's simply invalid arguments.
[01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:14.400]   - There's also an issue that, like, I've talked,
[01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:16.680]   again, I've talked to people at Apple and Google and YouTube
[01:23:16.680 --> 01:23:18.560]   'cause I wanted a well-rounded view on this.
[01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:20.520]   And they have the same arguments that we have
[01:23:20.520 --> 01:23:21.720]   because of course they do,
[01:23:21.720 --> 01:23:23.680]   and one of the biggest right now is just like,
[01:23:23.680 --> 01:23:26.960]   it's not a dumb thing, but like the unlike button on YouTube.
[01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:28.800]   Most social networks don't have a dislike button.
[01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:30.840]   YouTube does, and there's a huge argument
[01:23:30.840 --> 01:23:32.400]   about whether they should keep it or not,
[01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:34.480]   and it turns out most straight white males
[01:23:34.480 --> 01:23:35.600]   really want YouTube to keep it
[01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:38.560]   because it's how they judge whether a video is bad or not.
[01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:40.760]   But non-straight white people hate it
[01:23:40.760 --> 01:23:43.280]   because they get brigadeed, they have like mobs,
[01:23:43.280 --> 01:23:45.320]   and they've traced where these things start
[01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:48.720]   on other platforms and in discussion communities,
[01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:50.960]   and they get exactly what happened with Alex,
[01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:52.920]   and it's not just a human factor.
[01:23:52.920 --> 01:23:54.600]   I mean, we heard Facebook talking about,
[01:23:54.600 --> 01:23:56.920]   it's impossible for them to get enough people
[01:23:56.920 --> 01:23:58.640]   to manage their network yesterday,
[01:23:58.640 --> 01:24:01.040]   but it said these are huge issues that
[01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:02.240]   don't have clear cut answers.
[01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:03.480]   You have to make hard choices,
[01:24:03.480 --> 01:24:05.240]   and on one side, more people get flagged,
[01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:07.000]   and on the other side, more scams get in,
[01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.200]   and you can adjust that middle a little bit,
[01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:11.880]   but that scale is so huge
[01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:13.640]   that you can never get it exactly right.
[01:24:13.640 --> 01:24:16.280]   And I think one of the issues Apple had is that they were,
[01:24:16.280 --> 01:24:18.960]   it was not a very sophisticated reporter problem system.
[01:24:18.960 --> 01:24:20.600]   You report a problem on other social networks
[01:24:20.600 --> 01:24:21.760]   like YouTube or something.
[01:24:21.760 --> 01:24:24.680]   You have to dive through like two or three layers of menus,
[01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:27.160]   which deter is some people from reporting it,
[01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:29.280]   but also deter is a lot of people from brigading it.
[01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:31.640]   It becomes much more work to use it maliciously,
[01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:34.920]   and I think Apple needed to have a more sophisticated system
[01:24:34.920 --> 01:24:36.720]   than just put the button back in,
[01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:38.400]   and unfortunately I think they decided
[01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:40.280]   to just put the button back in at this point.
[01:24:40.280 --> 01:24:42.160]   >> Well, you do have to at least log in.
[01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:44.720]   And that's in your audience.
[01:24:44.720 --> 01:24:45.840]   >> Why is it problematic?
[01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:47.200]   Like what's the reason?
[01:24:47.200 --> 01:24:49.080]   >> Yeah, they can also build,
[01:24:49.080 --> 01:24:50.640]   one of the big advantages that Apple has
[01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:53.440]   over some of the other formats is that you generally have,
[01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:56.440]   you don't have lots of accounts with Apple.
[01:24:56.440 --> 01:24:59.720]   And so people brigading can only brigade for,
[01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:01.040]   that's right.
[01:25:01.040 --> 01:25:02.760]   >> It's tied to your Apple account.
[01:25:02.760 --> 01:25:03.600]   I think that's right.
[01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:05.920]   >> Apple can just say we're just gonna stop listening to you.
[01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:06.920]   >> But they bought for reviews.
[01:25:06.920 --> 01:25:07.760]   I mean, it happens.
[01:25:07.760 --> 01:25:09.960]   We've seen the review bots play like thousands
[01:25:09.960 --> 01:25:12.320]   and thousands of review bots, so they get in.
[01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:13.760]   >> Yeah, it happens.
[01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:14.600]   >> And they have brigaded.
[01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:16.800]   Like we had instances where competing apps,
[01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:18.800]   the same ones that use those bots for reviews,
[01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:21.520]   attack other people's apps with their little bot armies,
[01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:23.160]   because that's why we can't have nice things.
[01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:25.360]   >> We were talking about accessibility.
[01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:28.400]   This actually, I got a number of calls on the radio show
[01:25:28.400 --> 01:25:29.720]   over the last few weeks.
[01:25:29.720 --> 01:25:33.400]   iOS 15 has taken away some keys,
[01:25:33.400 --> 01:25:37.080]   Siri functionality that blind people, for instance, used.
[01:25:37.080 --> 01:25:40.560]   And a caller said, my wife who's blind used to say,
[01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:43.960]   Siri, read my mail and it doesn't work anymore.
[01:25:43.960 --> 01:25:46.960]   >> I can only, I really think that there's some kind of
[01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:47.800]   bug here.
[01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:48.640]   >> That's bad.
[01:25:48.640 --> 01:25:51.040]   >> The battle is so committed to accessibility.
[01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:52.480]   >> Yeah.
[01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:54.160]   >> Yeah, 'cause there was a bunch of stuff that went away
[01:25:54.160 --> 01:25:55.360]   that just came back.
[01:25:55.360 --> 01:25:57.800]   Like a year ago, you could say,
[01:25:57.800 --> 01:26:01.920]   Yo Jimbo, play Avengers Endgame on my Apple TV,
[01:26:01.920 --> 01:26:02.760]   and we'd do it.
[01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:03.960]   And then for a year, it stopped.
[01:26:03.960 --> 01:26:05.880]   And then now it's like, it's come back.
[01:26:05.880 --> 01:26:08.480]   And I think my hope is that they are migrating everything
[01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:10.000]   to a much more reliable system,
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:11.520]   'cause it actually works now.
[01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:13.320]   And then a lot of these features will come back.
[01:26:13.320 --> 01:26:14.640]   But if there's one community,
[01:26:14.640 --> 01:26:16.160]   you have to be overly communicative too.
[01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:18.000]   It's the, it's the,
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:19.160]   >> And they just took it out.
[01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:21.840]   Do I have any voicemails, play my voicemail messages,
[01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:24.640]   check my call history, check my recent calls,
[01:26:24.640 --> 01:26:26.800]   who called me, sent in the email,
[01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:28.440]   'cause this is terrible.
[01:26:28.440 --> 01:26:30.160]   I mean, people are calling up set.
[01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:31.600]   >> And they have two or seven issues.
[01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:33.160]   'Cause they always think that they're gonna be
[01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:34.000]   the first ones cut.
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:35.800]   And they're always, every time there's a release,
[01:26:35.800 --> 01:26:37.760]   they panic and think that things are taken away
[01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:40.360]   for all these, and they have to be reassured.
[01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:42.520]   Not in a patronizing way, but it's just like,
[01:26:42.520 --> 01:26:45.320]   through history, they have been the last people on the list
[01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:46.960]   and the first people to be rejected.
[01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:48.280]   And anytime a feature is gone,
[01:26:48.280 --> 01:26:51.000]   they suffer disproportionately for it.
[01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.760]   So again, like you have to talk to them.
[01:26:53.760 --> 01:26:58.240]   >> I had a caller whose wife used Siri to get an Uber,
[01:26:58.240 --> 01:27:00.040]   and you can't do that anymore.
[01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:02.040]   He said, you know, it was nice,
[01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:04.520]   'cause she could say the address she was going to,
[01:27:04.520 --> 01:27:06.720]   and it would be part of the Uber request,
[01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:08.040]   which of course you need to do.
[01:27:08.040 --> 01:27:11.680]   She can't really do it very well directly onto an iPhone.
[01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:13.640]   My only answer at this point was,
[01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:16.480]   you can make a shortcut, 'cause shortcuts will do that,
[01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:20.440]   but I think, I hope Apple fixes this.
[01:27:20.440 --> 01:27:21.400]   I hope this is a--
[01:27:21.400 --> 01:27:22.400]   >> Yeah, fast.
[01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:23.920]   >> And fast, it's an oversight.
[01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:25.200]   But there are a lot of people
[01:27:25.200 --> 01:27:27.280]   who are very discommoded by this right now.
[01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:29.400]   >> This, Renee is right on the money.
[01:27:29.400 --> 01:27:34.200]   There are no small, there are no inconveniences
[01:27:34.200 --> 01:27:37.400]   when it comes to reducing accessibility,
[01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:39.240]   when you have something that was a feature
[01:27:39.240 --> 01:27:40.640]   and is now no longer a feature.
[01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:44.440]   It's not a, oh gosh, now I gotta unlock my face ID,
[01:27:44.440 --> 01:27:45.920]   doesn't work anymore, and I'm gonna have to unlock it
[01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:47.360]   by typing my password.
[01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:49.400]   That's an inconvenience for me.
[01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:52.320]   When it, however, accessibility features means,
[01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:54.680]   this is something I can do with this phone,
[01:27:54.680 --> 01:27:57.280]   and now this is something I cannot do with this phone.
[01:27:57.280 --> 01:27:58.560]   And the fact that this is something
[01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:00.920]   that everybody else can do with this phone,
[01:28:00.920 --> 01:28:02.680]   means that this is not something
[01:28:02.680 --> 01:28:04.440]   that is optional by any means.
[01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:08.800]   That we can't, there's a fairly recent attitude
[01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:10.560]   that accessibility is just something
[01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:12.600]   that every user is entitled to.
[01:28:12.600 --> 01:28:14.720]   It's not, so aren't we nice that we're making
[01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:16.920]   these considerations as we're developing the,
[01:28:16.920 --> 01:28:19.520]   we're finding ways to make this product more accessible,
[01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:22.520]   or isn't it nice that we're finding a way
[01:28:22.520 --> 01:28:24.800]   that we can make this sidewalk easier to traverse?
[01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:28.000]   It's like, no, it isn't nice, you're supposed to do this,
[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:29.320]   this is supposed to be a consideration
[01:28:29.320 --> 01:28:32.840]   from the very, very first time you put pen to paper about this.
[01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:34.560]   And so, yeah, that's why this is,
[01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:35.760]   it is a non-trivial thing.
[01:28:35.760 --> 01:28:39.040]   Apple shouldn't be, it's not as though,
[01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:42.040]   I agree with the perception that there is a technical reason
[01:28:42.040 --> 01:28:42.760]   why they did this.
[01:28:42.760 --> 01:28:46.200]   Apple is, does such really wonderful work
[01:28:46.200 --> 01:28:48.120]   with accessibility, they would not have taken it out,
[01:28:48.120 --> 01:28:50.640]   unless there was a long argument about why they had to.
[01:28:50.640 --> 01:28:53.640]   - Or it's a bug, but it doesn't seem like a bug.
[01:28:53.640 --> 01:28:56.720]   - Again, or for that reason.
[01:28:56.720 --> 01:29:00.840]   But this is why they have to be open about,
[01:29:00.840 --> 01:29:02.680]   here is, we've taken this out,
[01:29:02.680 --> 01:29:04.200]   we can't tell you why we've taken this out,
[01:29:04.200 --> 01:29:05.640]   but we are replacing it with something
[01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:07.840]   that works better for a whole bunch of reasons
[01:29:07.840 --> 01:29:09.520]   that unfortunately we can't discuss yet.
[01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:12.400]   There are so many people who work in accessibility
[01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:15.280]   that you cannot assume that something was taken up
[01:29:15.280 --> 01:29:17.520]   because it's being moved to another library
[01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:19.440]   or because there was a bug that has to be done.
[01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:22.160]   It could be that they decided that there was only three people
[01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:26.560]   who were advocating for people who need accessibility features
[01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:28.560]   and two of them left for other companies.
[01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:31.280]   And so now, that's a voice they no longer have
[01:29:31.280 --> 01:29:32.120]   inside the room.
[01:29:32.120 --> 01:29:35.600]   So yeah, it's important to have this slide of communication.
[01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:38.200]   At least one person in Apple's,
[01:29:38.200 --> 01:29:41.160]   VizForm said that he had communicated with Apple,
[01:29:41.160 --> 01:29:42.680]   they said, we're aware of the problem
[01:29:42.680 --> 01:29:45.720]   when we're working on it, so let's hope they fix it quickly.
[01:29:45.720 --> 01:29:49.640]   There is a bug, it's probably not gonna hit you,
[01:29:49.640 --> 01:29:50.880]   but you should be aware of it.
[01:29:50.880 --> 01:29:54.240]   If you use Apple Pay's Express Transit feature,
[01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:56.080]   do not use a Visa card.
[01:29:56.080 --> 01:29:58.040]   (laughing)
[01:29:58.040 --> 01:30:00.000]   Researchers have demonstrated an attack
[01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:03.400]   using a contactless Veeamet Visa payment
[01:30:03.400 --> 01:30:07.200]   from a locked iPhone of a thousand pounds.
[01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:12.520]   They said that the payment terminal and used,
[01:30:12.520 --> 01:30:15.040]   do not, and by the way, you use an Android phone
[01:30:15.040 --> 01:30:18.120]   to do this attack, do not need to be near the victim's iPhone
[01:30:18.120 --> 01:30:20.280]   as long as there's an internet connection.
[01:30:20.280 --> 01:30:22.520]   Apple told the BBC the matter was an issue
[01:30:22.520 --> 01:30:25.200]   with the Visa credit card system,
[01:30:25.200 --> 01:30:29.160]   but Visa does not believe this kind of fraud
[01:30:29.160 --> 01:30:31.400]   is likely to take place in the real world
[01:30:31.400 --> 01:30:33.760]   given the multiple layers of security in place.
[01:30:33.760 --> 01:30:36.520]   And of course, Visa says in the unlikely event
[01:30:36.520 --> 01:30:39.560]   that an unauthorized payment does occur,
[01:30:39.560 --> 01:30:43.040]   you're protected by a Visa Zero liability policy.
[01:30:43.040 --> 01:30:46.560]   I would just-- - When you said that Leo,
[01:30:46.560 --> 01:30:47.720]   when you said that, I thought you were gonna talk
[01:30:47.720 --> 01:30:50.000]   about Safari tabs, so I got ready for a compose.
[01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:51.760]   - Yeah, ready for Safari tabs.
[01:30:51.760 --> 01:30:55.120]   John Gruber did a great takedown on Safari tabs
[01:30:55.120 --> 01:30:56.360]   on daring fire-able-- - So it is a human
[01:30:56.360 --> 01:30:58.960]   interface guide, so does Apple's human interface guide.
[01:30:58.960 --> 01:30:59.960]   (laughing)
[01:30:59.960 --> 01:31:02.840]   - His chief complaint seems to be,
[01:31:02.840 --> 01:31:05.680]   and by the way, you can turn this off, but it's the default.
[01:31:05.680 --> 01:31:08.520]   - Some of it, you can turn off.
[01:31:08.520 --> 01:31:10.400]   - One of the things the tabs do is they absorb
[01:31:10.400 --> 01:31:11.960]   the color of the site you're on,
[01:31:11.960 --> 01:31:15.800]   so it's no longer clear by looking at the tabs,
[01:31:15.800 --> 01:31:17.320]   which tab is active.
[01:31:17.320 --> 01:31:19.480]   - They look like fields.
[01:31:19.480 --> 01:31:20.720]   I can kind of type into them.
[01:31:20.720 --> 01:31:25.240]   - Yeah, and controls that are part of Safari
[01:31:25.240 --> 01:31:27.200]   appear to be part of the webpage now
[01:31:27.200 --> 01:31:30.560]   because everything is the color of the webpage you're on.
[01:31:30.560 --> 01:31:31.640]   Bad design.
[01:31:31.640 --> 01:31:33.960]   - And the closed tab button is the fav icon.
[01:31:33.960 --> 01:31:35.160]   Like, this is the first time in history,
[01:31:35.160 --> 01:31:37.200]   an icon has been destructive.
[01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:40.320]   But the worst part is like, this was shown off
[01:31:40.320 --> 01:31:42.880]   as part of Monterey, but they've shipped
[01:31:42.880 --> 01:31:44.120]   the new version of Safari.
[01:31:44.120 --> 01:31:45.680]   Like, I'm not running Monterey on this computer,
[01:31:45.680 --> 01:31:46.720]   it's a production computer.
[01:31:46.720 --> 01:31:49.360]   I still have the new Safari now, and I've been using it.
[01:31:49.360 --> 01:31:51.800]   I always give myself time, like, am I change a verse?
[01:31:51.800 --> 01:31:53.000]   Am I just said in my ways?
[01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.040]   If I give myself like a week, a month,
[01:31:55.040 --> 01:31:56.160]   am I gonna get used to it?
[01:31:56.160 --> 01:31:58.440]   I've been using it on the Monterey beta for three months
[01:31:58.440 --> 01:32:00.120]   and I'm still making mistakes with something
[01:32:00.120 --> 01:32:02.760]   that's a web interface that's spry.
[01:32:02.760 --> 01:32:06.320]   You know, like mosaic solved 30 years ago.
[01:32:06.320 --> 01:32:09.480]   - So, so Gruber says, you know, you're gonna wanna choose,
[01:32:09.480 --> 01:32:13.640]   I guess not the compact, but you're also layout,
[01:32:13.640 --> 01:32:18.280]   but you're also gonna uncheck this show color in tab bar.
[01:32:18.280 --> 01:32:20.440]   I don't know, mess with it till you get it the way you want it.
[01:32:20.440 --> 01:32:21.600]   - But it doesn't turn them back into tabs.
[01:32:21.600 --> 01:32:23.440]   They still look like fields or buttons.
[01:32:23.440 --> 01:32:25.040]   I keep going, like, why can't I call,
[01:32:25.040 --> 01:32:26.200]   oh, I mean, I'm just gonna act field.
[01:32:26.200 --> 01:32:27.680]   - It does look like a field.
[01:32:27.680 --> 01:32:29.080]   - Yeah, here's his example.
[01:32:29.080 --> 01:32:30.840]   And in fact, here's an example.
[01:32:30.840 --> 01:32:32.760]   So he's on two different pages.
[01:32:32.760 --> 01:32:34.840]   It turns gray when he's on daring fireball
[01:32:34.840 --> 01:32:36.880]   and it's red when it's on defector.
[01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:38.080]   - And which one is active?
[01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:38.880]   - And which one is active?
[01:32:38.880 --> 01:32:42.160]   Furthermore, he points out, see that little grid there?
[01:32:42.160 --> 01:32:47.160]   That's part of Safari's controls that,
[01:32:47.160 --> 01:32:52.320]   but it looks like it's part of the defector website
[01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:55.560]   'cause it's, that's gray, gray.
[01:32:55.560 --> 01:32:59.040]   So anyway, he says,
[01:32:59.040 --> 01:33:01.160]   turn compact tab layer.
[01:33:01.160 --> 01:33:05.240]   Oh, I don't know, you do, you figure out what you like.
[01:33:05.240 --> 01:33:06.720]   - There are some people who are yelling at us.
[01:33:06.720 --> 01:33:07.920]   Like some people who are yelling and saying,
[01:33:07.920 --> 01:33:09.120]   well, I happen to like it better.
[01:33:09.120 --> 01:33:11.480]   And the only thing I'll argue is subjectively,
[01:33:11.480 --> 01:33:13.200]   you can like the looks of anything better.
[01:33:13.200 --> 01:33:14.800]   Like that's a completely subjective thing.
[01:33:14.800 --> 01:33:17.000]   You can totally like it objectively.
[01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.560]   It violates Apple's own human interface guidelines
[01:33:19.560 --> 01:33:22.880]   and objectively the basic design tenants
[01:33:22.880 --> 01:33:25.400]   like state change or non-destructive acts.
[01:33:25.400 --> 01:33:28.280]   Like like things that are like the core principles
[01:33:28.280 --> 01:33:30.080]   of design are violated by this.
[01:33:30.080 --> 01:33:31.520]   So objectively it is bad,
[01:33:31.520 --> 01:33:33.280]   regardless of whether you subjectively like it.
[01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:34.880]   - So there.
[01:33:34.880 --> 01:33:37.440]   - Yep, there's the airplane principle of engineering
[01:33:37.440 --> 01:33:39.200]   that someone taught me years ago
[01:33:39.200 --> 01:33:40.960]   that does inform so many other things
[01:33:40.960 --> 01:33:43.480]   that there's a reason why all airplanes look alike.
[01:33:43.480 --> 01:33:45.120]   It's not because of lack of innovation.
[01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:46.520]   It's because when you make something
[01:33:46.520 --> 01:33:47.760]   that does not look like an airplane
[01:33:47.760 --> 01:33:49.400]   that's supposed to fly with an airplane,
[01:33:49.400 --> 01:33:51.120]   it tends to crash.
[01:33:51.120 --> 01:33:52.440]   So that doesn't mean there's no room
[01:33:52.440 --> 01:33:53.400]   for doing things differently,
[01:33:53.400 --> 01:33:58.080]   but saying that, okay, so you need to lock this person
[01:33:58.080 --> 01:34:00.880]   into a room with an investigator saying, okay.
[01:34:00.880 --> 01:34:04.360]   So the entire world of user interface designers
[01:34:04.360 --> 01:34:06.640]   and internet experts and users have decided
[01:34:06.640 --> 01:34:08.800]   that this is where the tab bar goes.
[01:34:08.800 --> 01:34:12.000]   You've decided that all those people are wrong
[01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:13.840]   and it should go down here.
[01:34:13.840 --> 01:34:15.560]   Now we're gonna order in Chinese food
[01:34:15.560 --> 01:34:17.920]   and we're not leaving this room until you convince me
[01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:20.880]   why you're right and everybody else is wrong.
[01:34:20.880 --> 01:34:26.040]   - There is a Safari 15.1 beta out now.
[01:34:26.040 --> 01:34:29.200]   Have you played with it, Renee?
[01:34:29.200 --> 01:34:32.280]   Does it fix this problem or is this, or no?
[01:34:32.280 --> 01:34:33.600]   Is this also the beta?
[01:34:33.600 --> 01:34:35.080]   - I have the web kit nightly.
[01:34:35.080 --> 01:34:36.040]   I don't know if they're still nightly.
[01:34:36.040 --> 01:34:36.880]   I don't check every day.
[01:34:36.880 --> 01:34:38.560]   I have the web kit out there.
[01:34:38.560 --> 01:34:40.720]   And I haven't noticed a change if there is one.
[01:34:40.720 --> 01:34:41.560]   Yeah, there might be.
[01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:44.720]   I haven't checked in a couple days, but it might be.
[01:34:44.720 --> 01:34:49.000]   - As somebody, as a Compi 386, as in the chat room,
[01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:52.200]   new Safari looks cooler, but does not work better.
[01:34:52.200 --> 01:34:53.040]   (laughing)
[01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:53.880]   - Yes.
[01:34:53.880 --> 01:34:55.080]   - Well, is this problem that Apple has?
[01:34:55.080 --> 01:34:57.520]   I think there's a lot of good things that came from iOS 7
[01:34:57.520 --> 01:35:00.040]   and the Allen Dye era of human interface design.
[01:35:00.040 --> 01:35:02.320]   But he's a graphic designer by background.
[01:35:02.320 --> 01:35:04.800]   He replaced Greg Christie, who was of the Scott Forest
[01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:07.200]   all Steve Jobs era, who was a very crunchy
[01:35:07.200 --> 01:35:09.560]   sort of traditional computer UI person.
[01:35:09.560 --> 01:35:11.760]   But over the last few years, there's been this trend
[01:35:11.760 --> 01:35:14.920]   of mistaking minimalism for simplicity.
[01:35:14.920 --> 01:35:16.880]   Where simplicity does not involve minimalism at all.
[01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:19.120]   Sometimes minimalist things are way more complicated,
[01:35:19.120 --> 01:35:21.320]   way more difficult than simplicity,
[01:35:21.320 --> 01:35:23.600]   or mistaking minimalism for elegance.
[01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:24.880]   These things are not the same,
[01:35:24.880 --> 01:35:26.760]   and you can't just remove things.
[01:35:26.760 --> 01:35:29.640]   Like you can remove, like Maya Angelus says,
[01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:31.600]   you remove as much as possible, but not too much.
[01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:33.680]   And we've gone way past the too much line.
[01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:35.400]   So I'm just careened right over it.
[01:35:35.400 --> 01:35:38.000]   - John Gruber even quotes Steve Jobs,
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:39.760]   who said, "Design is not how it looks.
[01:35:39.760 --> 01:35:41.560]   It's how it works."
[01:35:41.560 --> 01:35:44.000]   - Yeah, it looks come second.
[01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.260]   So form follows function.
[01:35:46.260 --> 01:35:52.280]   Apple is a bigger player in the video game industry
[01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:58.240]   than Microsoft, Nintendo, Activision, and Sony combined.
[01:35:58.240 --> 01:36:00.880]   - Don't tell Tim Epic.
[01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:01.880]   - Don't tell Tim Epic.
[01:36:01.880 --> 01:36:02.880]   - It was like the court so fast.
[01:36:02.880 --> 01:36:07.360]   - It's about games, the App Store,
[01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:10.480]   which takes 30% of sales, as you know.
[01:36:11.480 --> 01:36:16.480]   It gives Apple $8.5 billion per year in profit.
[01:36:16.480 --> 01:36:20.120]   That's more than all those other companies,
[01:36:20.120 --> 01:36:22.960]   Sony and Microsoft, and Nintendo,
[01:36:22.960 --> 01:36:25.160]   big console companies, throw in Activision,
[01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:27.840]   the big game company, combined.
[01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:30.680]   - And we should know that that's a number two.
[01:36:30.680 --> 01:36:33.000]   - Oh, that's a good question, yeah.
[01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:33.840]   - We should have expected it,
[01:36:33.840 --> 01:36:36.320]   'cause they got 30% of income, yeah, that's true.
[01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:38.000]   But they got 30% of Android games too.
[01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:39.640]   It's a huge business.
[01:36:39.640 --> 01:36:42.080]   And Sony gets 30% and Microsoft gets 30%.
[01:36:42.080 --> 01:36:43.680]   Like they're all taking 30%.
[01:36:43.680 --> 01:36:44.840]   - Yeah, they don't have the scale.
[01:36:44.840 --> 01:36:46.080]   There's a billion iPhones out there.
[01:36:46.080 --> 01:36:47.760]   - You know, Tesla's really interesting.
[01:36:47.760 --> 01:36:48.600]   - They're really interesting.
[01:36:48.600 --> 01:36:50.880]   - Microsoft's percentage on their App Store,
[01:36:50.880 --> 01:36:52.640]   and this is totally as a way of going,
[01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:55.200]   see, Apple is 1%.
[01:36:55.200 --> 01:36:57.960]   And it's totally--
[01:36:57.960 --> 01:36:59.360]   - Nobody's making apps, which is--
[01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:01.040]   - It doesn't matter, it costs them nothing.
[01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:02.560]   But it's a shot at Apple, you know,
[01:37:02.560 --> 01:37:05.080]   they make a big point about that.
[01:37:05.080 --> 01:37:08.840]   So wow, that's why revenue per user
[01:37:08.840 --> 01:37:10.720]   is a lot more interesting as to this.
[01:37:10.720 --> 01:37:13.200]   Then cumulently, how much money are you making?
[01:37:13.200 --> 01:37:14.640]   Because it comes down to,
[01:37:14.640 --> 01:37:18.080]   are you make, does everybody who plays games on an iPhone
[01:37:18.080 --> 01:37:19.880]   tend to spend a good amount of money
[01:37:19.880 --> 01:37:20.960]   to enhance their experience?
[01:37:20.960 --> 01:37:23.880]   Or is the iPhone just really, really good
[01:37:23.880 --> 01:37:25.600]   at taking money away from people
[01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:27.680]   the moment they have an impulse to spend it?
[01:37:27.680 --> 01:37:30.720]   That's sort of how many members of the user community
[01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:34.080]   are responsible for what percentage of that income?
[01:37:34.080 --> 01:37:35.760]   But yeah, as Renee says,
[01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:38.160]   the fact that you've got, it's scale, scale, scale,
[01:37:38.160 --> 01:37:41.320]   the fact that you've got a billion game consoles
[01:37:41.320 --> 01:37:44.600]   compared to how many game consoles are Xboxes?
[01:37:44.600 --> 01:37:47.040]   How many game consoles are earned in Nintendo switches?
[01:37:47.040 --> 01:37:48.600]   That tells the tale.
[01:37:48.600 --> 01:37:50.320]   - And it also makes sense, it shows you why
[01:37:50.320 --> 01:37:53.520]   they went through so much trouble to create Apple Arcade.
[01:37:53.520 --> 01:37:56.560]   - So it's a slow burn, but it's--
[01:37:56.560 --> 01:37:59.480]   - Don't buy another device, stay on this device.
[01:37:59.480 --> 01:38:01.960]   This is, there's so much involved in that action.
[01:38:01.960 --> 01:38:03.040]   - Yeah.
[01:38:03.040 --> 01:38:03.880]   - Yeah.
[01:38:03.880 --> 01:38:06.480]   - Well, it also allows them to take risks
[01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:08.080]   or build the kinds of games,
[01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:11.680]   or they can build a larger history of what they want.
[01:38:11.680 --> 01:38:14.440]   - Well, yeah, and really revenue per user
[01:38:14.440 --> 01:38:17.440]   and the growth of Apple's services
[01:38:17.440 --> 01:38:19.240]   is really the real story here.
[01:38:19.240 --> 01:38:23.040]   I've read a funny article in the Observer's
[01:38:23.040 --> 01:38:25.520]   State of the Streamer Apple TV plus
[01:38:25.520 --> 01:38:28.960]   why it's not necessarily competing with Netflix.
[01:38:28.960 --> 01:38:33.800]   The guy observes that it's really all about more subscribers,
[01:38:33.800 --> 01:38:37.520]   bids, builds revenue in Apple's services.
[01:38:37.520 --> 01:38:38.360]   Die.
[01:38:38.360 --> 01:38:40.280]   - It's all you add for Apple One.
[01:38:40.280 --> 01:38:41.120]   - Yeah.
[01:38:41.120 --> 01:38:45.720]   Apple TV's content budget is about $6.5 billion
[01:38:45.720 --> 01:38:49.360]   compared to $17 billion for Netflix.
[01:38:49.360 --> 01:38:52.280]   Amazon Prime Video, $9 billion.
[01:38:52.280 --> 01:38:55.800]   - What's insane is that $6.5 billion is like,
[01:38:55.800 --> 01:38:57.480]   oh, I'm just testing the one.
[01:38:57.480 --> 01:38:59.040]   - Yeah, I know.
[01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:00.360]   You know, like it's a very competitive--
[01:39:00.360 --> 01:39:01.200]   - It's competitive.
[01:39:01.200 --> 01:39:02.040]   - A lot of money on that.
[01:39:02.040 --> 01:39:03.920]   - It's spent on foundation.
[01:39:03.920 --> 01:39:06.040]   Is that expensive or is it all CGI?
[01:39:06.040 --> 01:39:07.560]   And so it's not so expensive.
[01:39:07.560 --> 01:39:12.600]   - My guess is 30 to $50 million in episode.
[01:39:12.600 --> 01:39:13.600]   - And episode.
[01:39:13.600 --> 01:39:15.960]   Holy cow.
[01:39:15.960 --> 01:39:17.320]   - That's more than friends.
[01:39:17.320 --> 01:39:18.320]   (laughing)
[01:39:18.320 --> 01:39:19.880]   - Oh yeah, it's more than, well,
[01:39:19.880 --> 01:39:23.920]   and the morning show or whatever was, I think, 15 million.
[01:39:23.920 --> 01:39:25.880]   We knew, I mean, I think someone figured that out.
[01:39:25.880 --> 01:39:27.320]   - So that always, Aniston and Witherspoon,
[01:39:27.320 --> 01:39:28.520]   that was all salary.
[01:39:28.520 --> 01:39:29.360]   - And yet--
[01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:31.880]   - And by the way, there's a big strike coming.
[01:39:31.880 --> 01:39:33.520]   - I suspect in the movie industry,
[01:39:33.520 --> 01:39:36.800]   'cause IOTC is about to, well, they're negotiating,
[01:39:36.800 --> 01:39:38.480]   but they voted to strike,
[01:39:38.480 --> 01:39:39.840]   so they could strike at any moment,
[01:39:39.840 --> 01:39:41.760]   that which would shut down TV productions
[01:39:41.760 --> 01:39:44.600]   and movie productions all over the country.
[01:39:44.600 --> 01:39:46.000]   - Which we wouldn't feel for a year.
[01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:46.840]   - Yeah.
[01:39:46.840 --> 01:39:47.680]   - I mean, like it's--
[01:39:47.680 --> 01:39:49.960]   - What's being shot now is coming out next year.
[01:39:49.960 --> 01:39:51.560]   - But Apple kind of gets off the hook there,
[01:39:51.560 --> 01:39:54.080]   'cause they say, well, we only have 20 million subscribers,
[01:39:54.080 --> 01:39:56.560]   so we're not in the top tier of streamers,
[01:39:56.560 --> 01:40:00.080]   so they don't actually have to pay IOTC employees as much.
[01:40:00.080 --> 01:40:01.400]   - Well, I think you have, you know,
[01:40:01.400 --> 01:40:04.680]   like they use, like the morning show is made,
[01:40:04.680 --> 01:40:07.040]   I believe, by Warner, like I think all of the stuff
[01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:08.320]   is studio stuff that they're buying.
[01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:11.880]   I don't know if Apple's producing that much on their own yet.
[01:40:11.880 --> 01:40:13.960]   - The streaming contact contracts
[01:40:13.960 --> 01:40:17.200]   are gonna be a big part of this IOTC negotiation.
[01:40:17.200 --> 01:40:18.160]   - Well, that is the big fight.
[01:40:18.160 --> 01:40:20.000]   - Yeah. - Well, just basic treatment.
[01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:21.360]   - Well, they mentioned treatment and everything,
[01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:23.520]   but I think the bottom line is--
[01:40:23.520 --> 01:40:25.240]   - There's salaries are like,
[01:40:25.240 --> 01:40:26.520]   but when you look at like the salaries
[01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:28.360]   and just the callousness with which they're treated,
[01:40:28.360 --> 01:40:29.960]   like that was a shocking thing for me.
[01:40:29.960 --> 01:40:32.040]   It's like, oh, you were just working 16 hours drive.
[01:40:32.040 --> 01:40:33.960]   Oh, he died, he had an accident, he drove home.
[01:40:33.960 --> 01:40:34.840]   - Yeah. - Doesn't matter.
[01:40:34.840 --> 01:40:37.080]   You know, like the treatment of those people
[01:40:37.080 --> 01:40:39.080]   who are so important in the industry was a pot,
[01:40:39.080 --> 01:40:41.760]   like beyond, for billion dollar companies,
[01:40:41.760 --> 01:40:42.960]   it was beyond appalling.
[01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:46.280]   - Well, Alex, you probably know better than anybody, Alex,
[01:40:46.280 --> 01:40:48.880]   but it's grips, it's kind of the lower level
[01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:51.760]   of plays who really get shafted by this, right?
[01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:54.560]   - Well, they, you know, a lot of them are,
[01:40:54.560 --> 01:40:57.600]   I mean, I think that in general, you know,
[01:40:57.600 --> 01:40:59.000]   it's actually much better than the United States
[01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:00.200]   than other countries I've worked,
[01:41:00.200 --> 01:41:02.080]   but not as good as other, you know, some, right?
[01:41:02.080 --> 01:41:03.600]   You know, like for instance, Germany is probably
[01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:06.960]   the most structured, you know, where we had someone we said,
[01:41:06.960 --> 01:41:08.480]   well, we said what happens after,
[01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:10.040]   I think it was, I can't remember the number,
[01:41:10.040 --> 01:41:11.520]   but it was, I think it was after 10 hours,
[01:41:11.520 --> 01:41:13.440]   well, it's over time, I said, what happens after 12?
[01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:14.520]   Like expecting double time, right?
[01:41:14.520 --> 01:41:16.480]   I really goes, oh, that's illegal.
[01:41:16.480 --> 01:41:17.840]   Like you're not allowed to work more than that.
[01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:19.720]   Like, like, you're literally,
[01:41:19.720 --> 01:41:21.240]   I can't remember whether it was 10 or 12 hours,
[01:41:21.240 --> 01:41:22.920]   but at 10 or 12 hours in Germany,
[01:41:22.920 --> 01:41:25.840]   you literally had a, we had a truck pull in
[01:41:25.840 --> 01:41:28.080]   to drop stuff off and they didn't unload it fast enough.
[01:41:28.080 --> 01:41:29.080]   - And that truck, it's over.
[01:41:29.080 --> 01:41:30.080]   - It's over.
[01:41:30.080 --> 01:41:30.920]   - It's over.
[01:41:30.920 --> 01:41:31.760]   - It wasn't allowed.
[01:41:31.760 --> 01:41:32.600]   - Sorry.
[01:41:32.600 --> 01:41:35.040]   - Was not allowed to come back and move the truck.
[01:41:35.040 --> 01:41:36.600]   - You have to go to bed.
[01:41:36.600 --> 01:41:37.480]   - Go to bed even for a minute.
[01:41:37.480 --> 01:41:38.800]   - You can see you tomorrow.
[01:41:38.800 --> 01:41:39.640]   I think that's good.
[01:41:39.640 --> 01:41:41.080]   I don't think that's a problem.
[01:41:41.080 --> 01:41:42.480]   - No, no, they did it because people were falling asleep
[01:41:42.480 --> 01:41:43.320]   on the way home.
[01:41:43.320 --> 01:41:45.320]   - Yeah, that's right.
[01:41:45.320 --> 01:41:46.920]   Para Analytics has a chart,
[01:41:46.920 --> 01:41:51.240]   kind of interesting chart about demand.
[01:41:51.240 --> 01:41:53.280]   This is demand distribution of all shows
[01:41:53.280 --> 01:41:55.520]   in the United States in the last 90 days.
[01:41:55.520 --> 01:41:57.080]   This is average.
[01:41:57.080 --> 01:41:58.080]   It's all Squid Game.
[01:41:58.080 --> 01:41:59.080]   Leo, it's all Squid Game.
[01:41:59.080 --> 01:42:00.720]   - Yeah, you're gonna have to tell me a Squid Game
[01:42:00.720 --> 01:42:02.760]   'cause I'm here and that's like the hottest thing right now.
[01:42:02.760 --> 01:42:04.800]   In fact, it's so big in South Korea
[01:42:04.800 --> 01:42:09.200]   that the ISPs are demanding money from Netflix.
[01:42:09.200 --> 01:42:10.040]   - Yes.
[01:42:10.040 --> 01:42:10.880]   (laughing)
[01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:13.040]   - You're using all the bandwidths.
[01:42:13.040 --> 01:42:18.040]   Ted Lasso by a large margin is the most rated by viewers,
[01:42:18.040 --> 01:42:22.440]   highly rated Apple Show,
[01:42:22.440 --> 01:42:24.520]   then for all mankind Mythic Quest,
[01:42:24.520 --> 01:42:28.480]   Schmigadoon, Sea and Servant in the Morning Show,
[01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:30.880]   Mosquito Coast, all in the Outstanding category,
[01:42:30.880 --> 01:42:33.360]   which is a tough category to get in.
[01:42:33.360 --> 01:42:38.000]   Seven Outstanding shows, two good shows in the top 10,
[01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:38.840]   which is a big joke.
[01:42:38.840 --> 01:42:40.120]   - I think that even with the reduced cursing
[01:42:40.120 --> 01:42:41.560]   in Morning Show this season.
[01:42:41.560 --> 01:42:43.200]   - Oh, thank God.
[01:42:43.200 --> 01:42:45.640]   I felt like they were just trying to show that they were edgy
[01:42:45.640 --> 01:42:48.360]   by putting the F word in every five seconds.
[01:42:48.360 --> 01:42:52.600]   - Yeah, I think that the hard part was,
[01:42:52.600 --> 01:42:54.120]   is I got all excited 'cause as a parent,
[01:42:54.120 --> 01:42:56.880]   I was always like, what can I watch with my kids?
[01:42:56.880 --> 01:42:58.720]   'Cause it's the only time I have to watch.
[01:42:58.720 --> 01:43:00.720]   And when Apple first came out with Apple TV,
[01:43:00.720 --> 01:43:01.920]   I was like, well, nothing.
[01:43:01.920 --> 01:43:02.760]   I can't watch anything.
[01:43:02.760 --> 01:43:04.000]   - Ted Lasso's solved that.
[01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:07.280]   - You know, and so the foundation is something
[01:43:07.280 --> 01:43:08.480]   we've all started to watch.
[01:43:08.480 --> 01:43:09.400]   You know, and--
[01:43:09.400 --> 01:43:10.920]   - Yes.
[01:43:10.920 --> 01:43:12.680]   - Well, Peanuts is good news.
[01:43:12.680 --> 01:43:14.200]   Peanuts is coming.
[01:43:14.200 --> 01:43:17.080]   The Peanuts Holiday Special,
[01:43:17.080 --> 01:43:19.640]   it's gonna, and if the first original one,
[01:43:19.640 --> 01:43:21.440]   how many years, Andy?
[01:43:21.440 --> 01:43:23.560]   (laughing)
[01:43:23.560 --> 01:43:25.520]   It'll be for New Year's.
[01:43:25.520 --> 01:43:28.080]   There's never been a Peanuts New Year's Holiday Special.
[01:43:28.080 --> 01:43:30.320]   - You thought Christmas and Halloween covered, right?
[01:43:30.320 --> 01:43:32.720]   I guess they had to find a new holiday.
[01:43:32.720 --> 01:43:34.800]   - Well, they have Arbor Day.
[01:43:34.800 --> 01:43:35.640]   - There's an Arbor Day?
[01:43:35.640 --> 01:43:38.480]   - I'm working forward to the Martin Luther King Day,
[01:43:38.480 --> 01:43:39.880]   Peanuts Holiday Special.
[01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:41.400]   So the-- - Just like New Year's
[01:43:41.400 --> 01:43:44.080]   - I think Peanuts is curb your enthusiasm for kids.
[01:43:44.080 --> 01:43:45.880]   (laughing)
[01:43:45.880 --> 01:43:46.880]   - It is, isn't it?
[01:43:46.880 --> 01:43:47.720]   That's good.
[01:43:47.720 --> 01:43:49.080]   - It is, it's just curb your kids.
[01:43:49.080 --> 01:43:49.920]   - Very apt.
[01:43:49.920 --> 01:43:52.160]   It'll be called For Old Lang Zion,
[01:43:52.160 --> 01:43:54.200]   in which the Peanuts gang will try and throw
[01:43:54.200 --> 01:43:57.800]   the best New Year's Eve party ever,
[01:43:57.800 --> 01:43:59.640]   until Lucy pulls it away at the last second.
[01:43:59.640 --> 01:44:01.560]   (laughing)
[01:44:01.560 --> 01:44:03.040]   By the way, it will be the first time
[01:44:03.040 --> 01:44:04.760]   a Peanuts TV special in the franchise
[01:44:04.760 --> 01:44:08.680]   does not feature Charlie Brown or Snoopy in the title.
[01:44:08.680 --> 01:44:10.040]   - Oh, yeah.
[01:44:10.040 --> 01:44:12.480]   - It's the great pumpkin, Charlie Brown.
[01:44:12.480 --> 01:44:14.640]   - Yep.
[01:44:14.640 --> 01:44:18.520]   It's, I think that Apple has proven
[01:44:18.520 --> 01:44:21.040]   to be a really good conservator
[01:44:21.040 --> 01:44:22.840]   of the Peanuts brand.
[01:44:22.840 --> 01:44:24.920]   They haven't tried to make it more marketable.
[01:44:24.920 --> 01:44:27.280]   They haven't, let's just say they haven't done
[01:44:27.280 --> 01:44:28.800]   to the Peanuts characters,
[01:44:28.800 --> 01:44:30.480]   what Disney did to them up, it's,
[01:44:30.480 --> 01:44:33.360]   which is you have no idea why these,
[01:44:33.360 --> 01:44:35.560]   these are just like licensed characters to you.
[01:44:35.560 --> 01:44:38.080]   They're hand puppets, you can cast in anything.
[01:44:38.080 --> 01:44:39.360]   - I'm seeing them in ads now.
[01:44:39.360 --> 01:44:42.200]   It makes me really angry, to be honest with you.
[01:44:42.200 --> 01:44:44.440]   - I do think that to Andy's point,
[01:44:44.440 --> 01:44:46.480]   the, what Apple is working on,
[01:44:46.480 --> 01:44:48.720]   I think very slowly, what it feels like is trust.
[01:44:48.720 --> 01:44:51.760]   You know, that if I see something on Apple TV
[01:44:51.760 --> 01:44:53.960]   that looks like it might be interesting,
[01:44:53.960 --> 01:44:57.960]   I'm pretty sure that it's going to be at least well done.
[01:44:57.960 --> 01:44:59.720]   You know, it's going to be well-written, well-written,
[01:44:59.720 --> 01:45:03.320]   well-shot, the quality is going to be really, really high.
[01:45:03.320 --> 01:45:07.480]   It's often a little over the top on the, you know,
[01:45:07.480 --> 01:45:10.720]   making a positive change sometimes for me.
[01:45:10.720 --> 01:45:11.720]   - I always feel Apple's--
[01:45:11.720 --> 01:45:13.640]   - It's got like a thumb on the scale and all of them.
[01:45:13.640 --> 01:45:15.600]   And I think that that's not good.
[01:45:15.600 --> 01:45:16.440]   - It's just, it's just kind of like,
[01:45:16.440 --> 01:45:18.080]   I want, I want homes, I like architecture.
[01:45:18.080 --> 01:45:19.920]   So I have like homes, but all of them
[01:45:19.920 --> 01:45:21.720]   are all about sustainability, which is fine.
[01:45:21.720 --> 01:45:23.120]   It's just that it doesn't, I was just kind of like,
[01:45:23.120 --> 01:45:25.360]   okay, I just wanted to watch some great architecture.
[01:45:25.360 --> 01:45:27.960]   You know, and, but I will say that like,
[01:45:27.960 --> 01:45:30.880]   tiny world is amazing, watched the music with Mark Ronson
[01:45:30.880 --> 01:45:34.480]   was really good, I wouldn't say amazing, but really good.
[01:45:34.480 --> 01:45:35.880]   Foundation is just eye candy.
[01:45:35.880 --> 01:45:37.640]   I mean, it's just, it's just incredible to watch.
[01:45:37.640 --> 01:45:38.480]   - Are we liking it?
[01:45:38.480 --> 01:45:40.280]   We've had three episodes now.
[01:45:40.280 --> 01:45:41.280]   What's the verdict?
[01:45:41.280 --> 01:45:44.680]   - My wife doesn't like it, but all the rest of us do.
[01:45:44.680 --> 01:45:46.960]   - My wife doesn't like it either.
[01:45:46.960 --> 01:45:47.800]   - Actually, she doesn't like it.
[01:45:47.800 --> 01:45:50.120]   - I've been too afraid to watch, to be honest with you.
[01:45:50.120 --> 01:45:50.960]   - Yeah.
[01:45:50.960 --> 01:45:51.800]   - No, it doesn't hurt.
[01:45:51.800 --> 01:45:53.600]   - It's like, dude, I have such strong feelings about it.
[01:45:53.600 --> 01:45:56.160]   - It's not, the good news is Foundation is so different
[01:45:56.160 --> 01:45:59.480]   from the novels that you won't really feel any disconnect.
[01:45:59.480 --> 01:46:01.200]   It's just a kind of related.
[01:46:01.200 --> 01:46:02.840]   - Georgia told me the first one was great.
[01:46:02.840 --> 01:46:04.280]   The second one wasn't great.
[01:46:04.280 --> 01:46:05.680]   The third one was pretty good.
[01:46:05.680 --> 01:46:06.520]   Let's say we review it.
[01:46:06.520 --> 01:46:07.520]   - That's fair so far.
[01:46:07.520 --> 01:46:09.000]   - Good news if you're an expert at--
[01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.920]   - Can I just offer one correction?
[01:46:11.920 --> 01:46:16.160]   There was a Charlie Brown New Year's special in 1986.
[01:46:16.160 --> 01:46:19.720]   I thought I remembered it because I remember the plot line
[01:46:19.720 --> 01:46:22.600]   where Charlie Brown has to write a book report
[01:46:22.600 --> 01:46:25.440]   on "War and Peace" over Christmas vacation and that's why.
[01:46:25.440 --> 01:46:26.520]   So yes.
[01:46:26.520 --> 01:46:27.960]   - Are you making this up?
[01:46:27.960 --> 01:46:29.600]   You're making this up.
[01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:32.480]   - He's making this up in 1986.
[01:46:32.480 --> 01:46:34.640]   There's only one major distraction on Charlie Brown's mind,
[01:46:34.640 --> 01:46:36.680]   the big New Year's party, all of his friends are attending
[01:46:36.680 --> 01:46:39.720]   with Peppermint Petty continuously convincing him to attend.
[01:46:39.720 --> 01:46:41.680]   Charlie tries inviting the object of his desires,
[01:46:41.680 --> 01:46:43.400]   the little redhead girl, but gets his hand caught
[01:46:43.400 --> 01:46:44.400]   in the mail slot.
[01:46:44.400 --> 01:46:49.000]   That sounds like a Bill of Linda's Charles Schulte Jam.
[01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.120]   - Permure enthusiasm for kids.
[01:46:51.120 --> 01:46:51.960]   - No, you're right.
[01:46:51.960 --> 01:46:52.800]   It is.
[01:46:52.800 --> 01:46:53.640]   Now that you've said that,
[01:46:53.640 --> 01:46:55.480]   I'll never see it the same way again.
[01:46:55.480 --> 01:46:57.040]   They are gonna do the same thing this year.
[01:46:57.040 --> 01:46:59.480]   Thank you, Apple, that they did last year.
[01:46:59.480 --> 01:47:02.080]   They will partner with PBS,
[01:47:02.080 --> 01:47:05.160]   so there will be a free television viewing of,
[01:47:05.160 --> 01:47:07.800]   it's a great pumpkin, it'll be on October 24th.
[01:47:07.800 --> 01:47:10.560]   Charlie Brown Thanksgiving November 21st,
[01:47:10.560 --> 01:47:12.640]   Charlie Brown Christmas December 19th.
[01:47:12.640 --> 01:47:15.200]   So I'm really glad they're preserving that broadcast
[01:47:15.200 --> 01:47:16.040]   tradition.
[01:47:16.040 --> 01:47:18.800]   You don't have to subscribe to Apple to see it.
[01:47:18.800 --> 01:47:21.760]   Nowadays, all you need to do is air it once.
[01:47:21.760 --> 01:47:24.360]   Everybody can T-vote it or whatever people do.
[01:47:24.360 --> 01:47:27.560]   - Yeah, it's still that television moment.
[01:47:27.560 --> 01:47:29.760]   I love the fact they ran the numbers and said,
[01:47:29.760 --> 01:47:32.720]   how much is it gonna cost for us to just let PBS air
[01:47:32.720 --> 01:47:34.440]   once on a scheduled time?
[01:47:34.440 --> 01:47:37.720]   And most people will still wanna watch it on demand
[01:47:37.720 --> 01:47:38.560]   whenever they want to,
[01:47:38.560 --> 01:47:40.320]   and that for that they'll come to Apple TV+.
[01:47:40.320 --> 01:47:42.440]   That was such a good smart decision.
[01:47:42.440 --> 01:47:44.040]   Because as opposed to, again,
[01:47:44.040 --> 01:47:46.320]   I hate to be a Disney bash or actually,
[01:47:46.320 --> 01:47:48.560]   I do enjoy it, but I don't wanna be seen as one.
[01:47:48.560 --> 01:47:49.680]   But yeah, it's like, why?
[01:47:49.680 --> 01:47:51.680]   We are in the business of selling things.
[01:47:51.680 --> 01:47:54.520]   We are not in the business of giving things away.
[01:47:54.520 --> 01:47:56.960]   (laughing)
[01:47:56.960 --> 01:48:00.120]   - This is purely rumor, but apparently,
[01:48:00.120 --> 01:48:01.480]   there's a big bid going on,
[01:48:01.480 --> 01:48:04.200]   bidding war going on for the NFL's Sunday night games,
[01:48:04.200 --> 01:48:06.680]   the Sunday, or no, I'm sorry, the Sunday ticket,
[01:48:06.680 --> 01:48:09.080]   which is not the Sunday night games.
[01:48:09.080 --> 01:48:12.600]   Amazon was deemed to be the lead contender.
[01:48:12.600 --> 01:48:17.000]   Disney's of ESPN, of course, is interested,
[01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:20.920]   but apparently the NFL likes Apple.
[01:48:20.920 --> 01:48:23.760]   - Wow, it has more money.
[01:48:23.760 --> 01:48:24.600]   (laughing)
[01:48:24.600 --> 01:48:25.840]   And they'll do a better job.
[01:48:25.840 --> 01:48:29.040]   You know, like, I mean, typically they'll push harder.
[01:48:29.040 --> 01:48:31.160]   And, you know, they'll,
[01:48:31.160 --> 01:48:33.400]   I think that Amazon actually has done a pretty good job.
[01:48:33.400 --> 01:48:36.040]   The fur, they started on Thursday nights, a little rough,
[01:48:36.040 --> 01:48:38.440]   but Amazon's done a pretty good job of--
[01:48:38.440 --> 01:48:39.880]   - They were rough on Thursday night.
[01:48:39.880 --> 01:48:40.720]   - Or pastry.
[01:48:40.720 --> 01:48:42.720]   - They're announcers on the first Thursday nights
[01:48:42.720 --> 01:48:44.600]   were not so good.
[01:48:44.600 --> 01:48:46.360]   - But losing teams can't use iPhones, right?
[01:48:46.360 --> 01:48:47.200]   Is that how it's gonna go?
[01:48:47.200 --> 01:48:48.040]   - That's right.
[01:48:48.040 --> 01:48:48.880]   (laughing)
[01:48:48.880 --> 01:48:50.800]   - And you have to throw those surfaces.
[01:48:50.800 --> 01:48:54.360]   Direct TV currently pays at $1.5 billion a year.
[01:48:54.360 --> 01:48:59.400]   That goes to the end of next season, so 2022.
[01:48:59.400 --> 01:49:02.480]   And apparently AT and T is not interested
[01:49:02.480 --> 01:49:03.640]   because the NFL is now saying,
[01:49:03.640 --> 01:49:06.760]   we want $2 billion a year.
[01:49:06.760 --> 01:49:08.680]   And this is like noise for Apple.
[01:49:08.680 --> 01:49:10.880]   So if Apple wants to, you know, it'd be very hard for you.
[01:49:10.880 --> 01:49:12.600]   - But remember, they only spent $6.5 billion
[01:49:12.600 --> 01:49:14.040]   on all the other stuff.
[01:49:14.040 --> 01:49:16.080]   - But it did different got another couple TVs.
[01:49:16.080 --> 01:49:18.160]   - Because if you wanna press live,
[01:49:18.160 --> 01:49:20.280]   which Apple hasn't done, you know, what they're doing.
[01:49:20.280 --> 01:49:21.760]   - That's the way to do it.
[01:49:21.760 --> 01:49:23.120]   - That's the way that, you know, football
[01:49:23.120 --> 01:49:24.520]   in the United States is the way to do it.
[01:49:24.520 --> 01:49:25.360]   I mean, the other-- - There's nothing,
[01:49:25.360 --> 01:49:26.400]   I think live is dying.
[01:49:26.400 --> 01:49:27.960]   What else do you wanna watch live?
[01:49:27.960 --> 01:49:29.760]   News and football.
[01:49:29.760 --> 01:49:32.000]   - And interactivity.
[01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:32.920]   You know, that's it.
[01:49:32.920 --> 01:49:33.840]   Those are the three.
[01:49:33.840 --> 01:49:35.520]   If you're gonna interact with the audience,
[01:49:35.520 --> 01:49:36.360]   or if you're gonna have--
[01:49:36.360 --> 01:49:38.200]   - Well, that's what we do, or shows live.
[01:49:38.200 --> 01:49:41.560]   Yeah, so I guess the voice, you know.
[01:49:41.560 --> 01:49:42.800]   - I don't even think those, I think,
[01:49:42.800 --> 01:49:43.640]   well, I don't know.
[01:49:43.640 --> 01:49:45.920]   I mean, when we do stuff where we're really interacting,
[01:49:45.920 --> 01:49:48.000]   I mean, there's a whole kind of content
[01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.960]   that we've seen the beginnings of
[01:49:50.960 --> 01:49:53.840]   where the audience is actually affecting the show.
[01:49:53.840 --> 01:49:56.320]   So think about the audience affecting the football game
[01:49:56.320 --> 01:49:57.680]   at the stadium.
[01:49:57.680 --> 01:49:59.640]   We've done shows where the audience is affecting--
[01:49:59.640 --> 01:50:01.280]   - That's cool. - The show progresses.
[01:50:01.280 --> 01:50:04.840]   And we have 150,000 people pushing the levers.
[01:50:04.840 --> 01:50:07.320]   - And-- - Well, that might be the other reason
[01:50:07.320 --> 01:50:08.720]   the NFL is interested in Apple,
[01:50:08.720 --> 01:50:11.160]   'cause couldn't they do some interesting things
[01:50:11.160 --> 01:50:13.520]   with interactivity? - Yeah, with devices,
[01:50:13.520 --> 01:50:15.760]   William-- - Well, it's not, you know.
[01:50:15.760 --> 01:50:17.080]   - Yeah, there's a lot.
[01:50:17.080 --> 01:50:20.440]   I mean, Apple, the ecosystem that Apple's building slowly,
[01:50:20.440 --> 01:50:22.120]   I don't know if they're gonna do anything with it.
[01:50:22.120 --> 01:50:23.440]   I know what I would do with it.
[01:50:23.440 --> 01:50:24.840]   I would tie all those things together.
[01:50:24.840 --> 01:50:27.520]   I would have content that had games,
[01:50:27.520 --> 01:50:29.480]   that had interactivity, that had live streaming,
[01:50:29.480 --> 01:50:32.720]   that there's so many places that if you own all the pieces,
[01:50:32.720 --> 01:50:33.800]   no one else does that.
[01:50:33.800 --> 01:50:36.640]   You know, where they own all the pieces of that puzzle.
[01:50:36.640 --> 01:50:38.360]   If you own all the pieces of that puzzle,
[01:50:38.360 --> 01:50:39.680]   there's a lot more that you can do
[01:50:39.680 --> 01:50:41.600]   than we haven't seen before.
[01:50:41.600 --> 01:50:43.560]   And you don't have to activate it anytime soon,
[01:50:43.560 --> 01:50:45.880]   but you could flip a switch and really create
[01:50:45.880 --> 01:50:48.520]   an entirely different kind of interaction and content
[01:50:48.520 --> 01:50:50.080]   than what we're doing now.
[01:50:50.080 --> 01:50:51.560]   - Last story before our picks of the week,
[01:50:51.560 --> 01:50:52.560]   so get those ready.
[01:50:52.560 --> 01:50:54.560]   I hope this is not somebody's pick of the week,
[01:50:54.560 --> 01:50:57.200]   but I will mention that Filmic Pro
[01:50:57.200 --> 01:51:00.320]   has announced they are gonna support ProRes
[01:51:00.320 --> 01:51:03.140]   on the iPhone 13 and Pro Max.
[01:51:04.140 --> 01:51:04.980]   - It was my pick.
[01:51:04.980 --> 01:51:06.140]   I think I'm happy to run with it now.
[01:51:06.140 --> 01:51:06.980]   - Was it?
[01:51:06.980 --> 01:51:08.740]   - Yep.
[01:51:08.740 --> 01:51:11.820]   - I forget I said anything, let's take a break.
[01:51:11.820 --> 01:51:15.580]   I was looking at the picks, I didn't see it.
[01:51:15.580 --> 01:51:17.480]   Oh, you didn't have it, that's why.
[01:51:17.480 --> 01:51:19.660]   Damn, I'm sorry.
[01:51:19.660 --> 01:51:20.500]   All right.
[01:51:20.500 --> 01:51:21.940]   - It should be in there, but I'm having connection problems
[01:51:21.940 --> 01:51:23.020]   with people right now.
[01:51:23.020 --> 01:51:27.140]   - I will pretend you didn't hear that.
[01:51:27.140 --> 01:51:30.500]   Our show today, we'll take a break, come back.
[01:51:30.500 --> 01:51:32.780]   But I was afraid it might be.
[01:51:32.780 --> 01:51:33.820]   We'll come back in just a moment
[01:51:33.820 --> 01:51:35.420]   with our picks of the week.
[01:51:35.420 --> 01:51:37.380]   Our show today brought to you by ZipRecruiter.
[01:51:37.380 --> 01:51:39.300]   Actually, a lot of our staff is brought to us
[01:51:39.300 --> 01:51:40.700]   by ZipRecruiter.
[01:51:40.700 --> 01:51:43.300]   We love hiring through ZipRecruiter.
[01:51:43.300 --> 01:51:44.660]   Look, there are some things in life
[01:51:44.660 --> 01:51:46.500]   you like to pick out by yourself.
[01:51:46.500 --> 01:51:51.180]   Your favorite mattress, your favorite bottle of wine,
[01:51:51.180 --> 01:51:53.020]   your favorite cut of steak.
[01:51:53.020 --> 01:51:57.260]   Wouldn't it be nice if you could do the same thing
[01:51:57.260 --> 01:51:58.220]   for hiring?
[01:51:58.220 --> 01:52:01.700]   That's where ZipRecruiter's invite to apply feature comes in.
[01:52:01.700 --> 01:52:04.900]   It lets you pick your favorites from top candidates.
[01:52:04.900 --> 01:52:07.260]   Right now, you could try ZipRecruiter free
[01:52:07.260 --> 01:52:11.140]   at zipprecruiter.com/macbreak.
[01:52:11.140 --> 01:52:11.980]   It's really cool.
[01:52:11.980 --> 01:52:13.340]   When you post on ZipRecruiter,
[01:52:13.340 --> 01:52:15.660]   you're immediately posting to 100 plus job boards,
[01:52:15.660 --> 01:52:17.300]   social media everywhere.
[01:52:17.300 --> 01:52:18.940]   You're spreading your net why.
[01:52:18.940 --> 01:52:20.100]   But then ZipRecruiter has something
[01:52:20.100 --> 01:52:21.580]   no one else does, it's brilliant.
[01:52:21.580 --> 01:52:23.660]   They look at the resumes they have on file
[01:52:23.660 --> 01:52:25.100]   and they see if there's matches.
[01:52:25.100 --> 01:52:26.100]   And then they let you know, they say,
[01:52:26.100 --> 01:52:27.980]   look, we've got 25 people here
[01:52:27.980 --> 01:52:29.140]   who might be a good match.
[01:52:29.140 --> 01:52:33.100]   And then they let you invite those people to apply.
[01:52:33.100 --> 01:52:36.460]   That is amazing.
[01:52:36.460 --> 01:52:38.540]   They actually send you the most qualified people
[01:52:38.540 --> 01:52:39.660]   for your job.
[01:52:39.660 --> 01:52:43.220]   You review the candidates, you invite your top choices.
[01:52:43.220 --> 01:52:45.700]   And it really works.
[01:52:45.700 --> 01:52:48.540]   In fact, people who get invited by the company
[01:52:48.540 --> 01:52:52.300]   they're applying to are much more likely to respond.
[01:52:52.300 --> 01:52:54.420]   This has become a big problem, by the way.
[01:52:54.420 --> 01:52:57.420]   You know, it's so competitive now.
[01:52:57.420 --> 01:52:59.220]   You want to have that little extra edge.
[01:52:59.220 --> 01:53:02.380]   Lauren Webb, who's SVP of talent acquisition
[01:53:02.380 --> 01:53:05.500]   for Mendoza Health, raves about ZipRecruiter's invite
[01:53:05.500 --> 01:53:06.340]   to apply.
[01:53:06.340 --> 01:53:08.100]   She says, I love that feature because we have
[01:53:08.100 --> 01:53:10.500]   a much higher follow through rate.
[01:53:10.500 --> 01:53:13.460]   If I invite candidates, it's easy for me.
[01:53:13.460 --> 01:53:14.660]   It's easy for them.
[01:53:14.660 --> 01:53:17.340]   It shows your interest and that really helps.
[01:53:17.340 --> 01:53:19.460]   ZipRecruiter's technology is so effective.
[01:53:19.460 --> 01:53:21.860]   And I will back this up because it's true for us.
[01:53:21.860 --> 01:53:24.660]   Four out of five employers who post on ZipRecruiter
[01:53:24.660 --> 01:53:27.300]   get a quality candidate within the first day
[01:53:27.300 --> 01:53:27.820]   for us.
[01:53:27.820 --> 01:53:29.420]   It's been within the first hours.
[01:53:29.420 --> 01:53:32.780]   I'm always-- because I get to watch this from the sidelines,
[01:53:32.780 --> 01:53:34.140]   as Lisa's posting.
[01:53:34.140 --> 01:53:35.940]   And I love the reaction.
[01:53:35.940 --> 01:53:37.380]   Oh, we got a good candidate.
[01:53:37.380 --> 01:53:39.620]   She just gets so happy about this.
[01:53:39.620 --> 01:53:40.420]   See for yourself.
[01:53:40.420 --> 01:53:46.740]   Just go to the exclusive web address, zipprecruiter.com/macbreak.
[01:53:46.740 --> 01:53:50.260]   Z-I-P-R-E-C-R-U-I-T-E-R.
[01:53:50.260 --> 01:53:54.380]   ZipRecruiter.com/macbrac.
[01:53:54.380 --> 01:53:56.100]   ZipRecruiter.com/macbrac.
[01:53:56.100 --> 01:53:58.900]   You can actually try it for free.
[01:53:58.900 --> 01:54:00.460]   This is really the way to hire.
[01:54:00.460 --> 01:54:04.740]   The smart way to hire zipprecruiter.com/macbreak.
[01:54:04.740 --> 01:54:08.500]   Thank you, ZipRecruiter, for the good job you do for us.
[01:54:08.500 --> 01:54:09.580]   All right, Renee Ritchie.
[01:54:09.580 --> 01:54:12.420]   I almost stole your thunder.
[01:54:12.420 --> 01:54:13.500]   No, I'm sorry.
[01:54:13.500 --> 01:54:15.540]   I wish that Google Docs are not saving.
[01:54:15.540 --> 01:54:16.700]   I wish that they were saving it.
[01:54:16.700 --> 01:54:23.620]   Some way I could shoot ProRes on my new iPhone 13 Pro.
[01:54:23.620 --> 01:54:24.300]   Is there any--
[01:54:24.300 --> 01:54:25.300]   There's reality.
[01:54:25.300 --> 01:54:27.900]   Apple hasn't announced it yet.
[01:54:27.900 --> 01:54:29.700]   Like they said, it's coming later.
[01:54:29.700 --> 01:54:31.700]   But all the technologies in there,
[01:54:31.700 --> 01:54:33.860]   the accelerators are in the silicon.
[01:54:33.860 --> 01:54:36.300]   So Filmic just did it on their own.
[01:54:36.300 --> 01:54:37.860]   And they shipped it yesterday.
[01:54:37.860 --> 01:54:39.340]   And they're doing--
[01:54:39.340 --> 01:54:40.660]   it's all 10-bit.
[01:54:40.660 --> 01:54:42.140]   It's all 4.2.2.
[01:54:42.140 --> 01:54:45.580]   They're doing ProRes proxy at 170 megabits per second.
[01:54:45.580 --> 01:54:47.580]   ProRes LT at 360.
[01:54:47.580 --> 01:54:49.980]   ProRes 4.2.2 at 540.
[01:54:49.980 --> 01:54:54.060]   And ProRes HQ, just at the Alex Lindsey special, as we call it,
[01:54:54.060 --> 01:54:56.260]   at 735 megabits per second.
[01:54:56.260 --> 01:54:56.780]   Sway a minute.
[01:54:56.780 --> 01:54:57.700]   And they have the--
[01:54:57.700 --> 01:55:00.660]   --35 megabits per second.
[01:55:00.660 --> 01:55:07.260]   So that's roughly 735 megabits every 10 seconds.
[01:55:07.260 --> 01:55:09.820]   It turns out to be around the 6 gigabytes per minute
[01:55:09.820 --> 01:55:10.180]   that we--
[01:55:10.180 --> 01:55:11.660]   Holy cow.
[01:55:11.660 --> 01:55:13.860]   You better hope you got the terabyte phone.
[01:55:13.860 --> 01:55:15.420]   That's all I can say.
[01:55:15.420 --> 01:55:17.060]   Well, he was talking about that in that video.
[01:55:17.060 --> 01:55:18.420]   He talks about it and says that he got--
[01:55:18.420 --> 01:55:19.980]   I think he got to like in one day,
[01:55:19.980 --> 01:55:23.940]   he got to about 700 gigabytes of ProRes on his terabyte.
[01:55:23.940 --> 01:55:24.820]   I understand it looked good.
[01:55:24.820 --> 01:55:27.060]   And then his next challenge was getting it off,
[01:55:27.060 --> 01:55:29.740]   getting it off the iPhone afterwards, which wasn't speedy.
[01:55:29.740 --> 01:55:31.620]   I'm not even watching this at 1080.
[01:55:31.620 --> 01:55:34.300]   Let me turn it up to 2160.
[01:55:34.300 --> 01:55:37.260]   A lot of people are theorizing that Apple's little cinema
[01:55:37.260 --> 01:55:38.780]   mode demo was actually done in ProRes
[01:55:38.780 --> 01:55:42.940]   because it looks way better than it has any right to look.
[01:55:42.940 --> 01:55:43.860]   But it's just--
[01:55:43.860 --> 01:55:46.180]   Filmic Pro is pushing the limits again.
[01:55:46.180 --> 01:55:46.860]   And you--
[01:55:46.860 --> 01:55:48.140]   I'm going to hand it off to Alex because he
[01:55:48.140 --> 01:55:49.220]   looks planet way better than me.
[01:55:49.220 --> 01:55:52.460]   But if you want it now, it's there.
[01:55:52.460 --> 01:55:54.380]   I've done a lot of shooting with Filmic Pro
[01:55:54.380 --> 01:55:59.140]   with the last version with HE/HEVC with Apple ProRes.
[01:55:59.140 --> 01:56:00.740]   It's amazing.
[01:56:00.740 --> 01:56:03.100]   And so I think that it is--
[01:56:03.100 --> 01:56:04.940]   the ProRes is just going to change.
[01:56:04.940 --> 01:56:06.300]   And here's all I'm going to say is
[01:56:06.300 --> 01:56:09.460]   that when you get a phone that has ProRes in it,
[01:56:09.460 --> 01:56:10.740]   you're going to look at home movies
[01:56:10.740 --> 01:56:12.820]   and all the other things that you shot before that
[01:56:12.820 --> 01:56:14.740]   as a little bit of a bummer.
[01:56:14.740 --> 01:56:15.700]   Like not everything.
[01:56:15.700 --> 01:56:17.540]   There's a lot of things that you can just shoot and post
[01:56:17.540 --> 01:56:18.660]   and it doesn't matter.
[01:56:18.660 --> 01:56:22.100]   But the thought that you could have something in your pocket
[01:56:22.100 --> 01:56:24.820]   that would capture ProRes of especially things
[01:56:24.820 --> 01:56:27.300]   that might be important to you is pretty cool.
[01:56:27.300 --> 01:56:30.380]   And if you're a creator, it's now a must-have.
[01:56:30.380 --> 01:56:32.300]   And Apple has spent a lot of time paying attention
[01:56:32.300 --> 01:56:33.420]   to creators.
[01:56:33.420 --> 01:56:35.500]   If you're a creator and you want to do anything
[01:56:35.500 --> 01:56:39.940]   with your phone, the ProRes is kind of a game changer.
[01:56:39.940 --> 01:56:44.740]   As far as being able to, I wouldn't say all,
[01:56:44.740 --> 01:56:49.300]   but almost all of the creators that I've worked with
[01:56:49.300 --> 01:56:51.620]   in the last five years are using iPhones.
[01:56:51.620 --> 01:56:53.020]   Or using Apple products.
[01:56:53.020 --> 01:56:53.780]   They're using Final Cut.
[01:56:53.780 --> 01:56:55.860]   They're using-- they're not the only ones that we talk--
[01:56:55.860 --> 01:56:58.140]   that we see using something else or people who are trying
[01:56:58.140 --> 01:56:58.980]   to get a job somewhere.
[01:56:58.980 --> 01:57:00.420]   So they want to get-- they want to use Premiere.
[01:57:00.420 --> 01:57:01.820]   They want to use something else.
[01:57:01.820 --> 01:57:03.620]   But when they're just working for themselves,
[01:57:03.620 --> 01:57:05.740]   we just run into an enormous number of folks
[01:57:05.740 --> 01:57:09.500]   that are using Final Cut and they're using iPhones,
[01:57:09.500 --> 01:57:10.140]   like TikTok.
[01:57:10.140 --> 01:57:11.740]   I mean, it was literally every person,
[01:57:11.740 --> 01:57:13.940]   except for the ones that were getting paid to use Samsung.
[01:57:13.940 --> 01:57:16.460]   So anyway, so the--
[01:57:16.460 --> 01:57:19.540]   so this is a game changer for that.
[01:57:19.540 --> 01:57:22.300]   And so for creators, I think, that are shooting with their phone
[01:57:22.300 --> 01:57:24.740]   already, being able to capture this content at this level,
[01:57:24.740 --> 01:57:27.700]   they don't care about the transfer time or the--
[01:57:27.700 --> 01:57:29.820]   I'll just get the one terabyte like I got.
[01:57:29.820 --> 01:57:31.780]   So I was like, one terabyte.
[01:57:31.780 --> 01:57:32.340]   Thank you very much.
[01:57:32.340 --> 01:57:33.260]   So this video--
[01:57:33.260 --> 01:57:36.860]   I should give credit to Michael Tobin, this video.
[01:57:36.860 --> 01:57:39.860]   Was shot by Michael Tobin using Filmic Pro.
[01:57:39.860 --> 01:57:42.380]   Must see.
[01:57:42.380 --> 01:57:43.500]   Really impressive.
[01:57:43.500 --> 01:57:44.300]   So anyway, it's--
[01:57:44.300 --> 01:57:46.140]   Weird things were like people say--
[01:57:46.140 --> 01:57:47.940]   people love to say Apple doesn't innovate anymore.
[01:57:47.940 --> 01:57:49.340]   Apple hasn't innovated in years.
[01:57:49.340 --> 01:57:50.660]   And you can't fold an iPhone.
[01:57:50.660 --> 01:57:51.300]   And I mourn that.
[01:57:51.300 --> 01:57:52.340]   I do want foldable stuff.
[01:57:52.340 --> 01:57:54.740]   But when you look at everyday innovation,
[01:57:54.740 --> 01:57:56.260]   when you look at what it takes, just
[01:57:56.260 --> 01:57:58.540]   like a silicon level to a camera stack
[01:57:58.540 --> 01:58:02.700]   to be able to get ProRes 422, HQ on a phone,
[01:58:02.700 --> 01:58:03.780]   it's astounding.
[01:58:03.780 --> 01:58:06.220]   It's duplifying to me the amount, the quality of the work
[01:58:06.220 --> 01:58:08.580]   that those teams are putting into these things these days.
[01:58:08.580 --> 01:58:09.940]   And the pressure, I mean, I think
[01:58:09.940 --> 01:58:11.020]   we're just at the very beginning too,
[01:58:11.020 --> 01:58:12.980]   because I think right now it's still at a 709.
[01:58:12.980 --> 01:58:15.660]   So it's not doing HDR.
[01:58:15.660 --> 01:58:17.300]   I mean, I don't think it's doing HDR capture.
[01:58:17.300 --> 01:58:18.900]   I mean, the HQ is capable of it.
[01:58:18.900 --> 01:58:20.660]   So I'm not-- and I'm not clear, because I have a--
[01:58:20.660 --> 01:58:21.180]   I think Apple's version.
[01:58:21.180 --> 01:58:22.820]   I think Apple's really the most--
[01:58:22.820 --> 01:58:25.380]   My phone showed up at 11 o'clock, right?
[01:58:25.380 --> 01:58:27.500]   We're getting ready for the show.
[01:58:27.500 --> 01:58:30.020]   So I haven't gotten to go out and play with it yet.
[01:58:30.020 --> 01:58:33.020]   But with the HDR, you have really
[01:58:33.020 --> 01:58:37.740]   consumers able to shoot content that is often better
[01:58:37.740 --> 01:58:42.540]   than what a lot of other folks are shooting for work.
[01:58:42.540 --> 01:58:44.460]   So I think that that's going to--
[01:58:44.460 --> 01:58:46.220]   It's going to really upgrade my TikToks.
[01:58:46.220 --> 01:58:49.820]   I could tell you that right now.
[01:58:49.820 --> 01:58:53.460]   Well, you get used to-- the one thing I notice--
[01:58:53.460 --> 01:58:55.140]   and we've had people ask questions,
[01:58:55.140 --> 01:58:58.300]   like, why does my video look so much better on my phone
[01:58:58.300 --> 01:59:00.220]   than what I'm seeing on TV?
[01:59:00.220 --> 01:59:02.020]   Well, they have a standard definition--
[01:59:02.020 --> 01:59:04.220]   or standard dynamic range TV, and they have a phone,
[01:59:04.220 --> 01:59:07.540]   and it's shooting, and displaying back an HDR.
[01:59:07.540 --> 01:59:09.060]   And what happens is they just get used to it.
[01:59:09.060 --> 01:59:10.420]   And this will be the same thing that happens
[01:59:10.420 --> 01:59:12.340]   as we get used to 120 frames per second.
[01:59:12.340 --> 01:59:14.460]   When that starts to really pick up speed,
[01:59:14.460 --> 01:59:17.380]   is people are going to get used to watching stuff
[01:59:17.380 --> 01:59:19.660]   at 120 frames per second on their phone and on their iPad
[01:59:19.660 --> 01:59:21.020]   and other things like that.
[01:59:21.020 --> 01:59:22.660]   And potentially, they're Apple TV.
[01:59:22.660 --> 01:59:24.820]   They'll take their home movies that are 120 frames per second
[01:59:24.820 --> 01:59:26.500]   and they'll throw them up on their Apple TV.
[01:59:26.500 --> 01:59:27.900]   And they'll get used to that.
[01:59:27.900 --> 01:59:30.940]   And then they'll look back at other things and go, why is this
[01:59:30.940 --> 01:59:33.060]   so choppy?
[01:59:33.060 --> 01:59:35.740]   So that's what Apple's kind of pressing down.
[01:59:35.740 --> 01:59:38.780]   It's not just that it's great content,
[01:59:38.780 --> 01:59:41.500]   but having the entire pipeline part
[01:59:41.500 --> 01:59:44.740]   of their ecosystem means that they can keep on innovating
[01:59:44.740 --> 01:59:47.540]   and kind of pressing the whole industry forward.
[01:59:47.540 --> 01:59:48.540]   Whether it like the system.
[01:59:48.540 --> 01:59:49.940]   Even Michael Fisher, who's like--
[01:59:49.940 --> 01:59:51.860]   Michael Fisher is a huge Android reviewer, loves Android,
[01:59:51.860 --> 01:59:52.820]   and there's a bunch of them.
[01:59:52.820 --> 01:59:55.420]   He'll say in his review, like, I don't like iPhones.
[01:59:55.420 --> 01:59:57.780]   They're not my thing, but I keep one in my pocket every day,
[01:59:57.780 --> 01:59:59.620]   because that's what I have to shoot B-roll with,
[01:59:59.620 --> 02:00:02.740]   or people who are in social medias, because it's consistent.
[02:00:02.740 --> 02:00:04.900]   Like, when you switch lenses, the color stays the same.
[02:00:04.900 --> 02:00:06.260]   When you go into dark or light areas,
[02:00:06.260 --> 02:00:07.620]   the video doesn't blow out.
[02:00:07.620 --> 02:00:10.580]   All these little tiny things that just make their lives
[02:00:10.580 --> 02:00:13.180]   as creators to Alex's point so much easier.
[02:00:13.180 --> 02:00:15.700]   And then the Instagram barely works on anything,
[02:00:15.700 --> 02:00:18.460]   but it works fairly consistently on an iPhone.
[02:00:18.460 --> 02:00:19.580]   And the same thing.
[02:00:19.580 --> 02:00:21.860]   And the camera APIs, because all the iPhone cameras
[02:00:21.860 --> 02:00:25.380]   are the same at the API abstracted level,
[02:00:25.380 --> 02:00:27.980]   you have access to Filmmake and Focus,
[02:00:27.980 --> 02:00:31.780]   and Halide and all these really good quality apps.
[02:00:31.780 --> 02:00:34.340]   So it's a very good platform for creators.
[02:00:34.340 --> 02:00:36.740]   Kudos to the Filmmake Pro folks for finding this
[02:00:36.740 --> 02:00:38.660]   and giving us access to it.
[02:00:38.660 --> 02:00:40.300]   That's amazing.
[02:00:40.300 --> 02:00:42.140]   42HQ. Wow.
[02:00:42.140 --> 02:00:43.020]   It's pretty much the standard.
[02:00:43.020 --> 02:00:44.380]   I mean, Filmmake has really gotten to the point
[02:00:44.380 --> 02:00:45.700]   where if you're looking for,
[02:00:45.700 --> 02:00:47.780]   I wanna shoot something professional with my,
[02:00:47.780 --> 02:00:49.260]   and they've been doing it for a long time,
[02:00:49.260 --> 02:00:53.940]   but I wanna shoot something professional with my phone.
[02:00:53.940 --> 02:00:55.460]   Filmmake is the way to do that.
[02:00:55.460 --> 02:00:56.940]   I guess so.
[02:00:56.940 --> 02:00:59.220]   I already have Filmmake Pro, so I'll get the upgrade
[02:00:59.220 --> 02:01:03.460]   and I'll be able to do it on my non-existent iPhone 13.
[02:01:03.460 --> 02:01:05.220]   And you know, when they, when I think they went,
[02:01:05.220 --> 02:01:10.060]   Filmmake adds log and, you know, log curves and HDR.
[02:01:10.060 --> 02:01:11.900]   You know, HD, typical HDR curves.
[02:01:11.900 --> 02:01:14.660]   I think that when it's able to capture, you know, vision
[02:01:14.660 --> 02:01:18.180]   or HLG and, you know, that kind of thing, or PQ,
[02:01:18.180 --> 02:01:20.580]   those things are gonna be really much more interesting
[02:01:20.580 --> 02:01:21.740]   than where they are right now.
[02:01:21.740 --> 02:01:22.700]   This is the first step.
[02:01:22.700 --> 02:01:24.100]   And I'm sure that they'll be able to take advantage
[02:01:24.100 --> 02:01:25.780]   of it as soon as they get access.
[02:01:25.780 --> 02:01:31.740]   Alex, you wanna do your pick as long as you're on the horn here?
[02:01:31.740 --> 02:01:32.780]   Yeah, absolutely.
[02:01:32.780 --> 02:01:37.740]   This one, I kind of fell into this last week.
[02:01:37.740 --> 02:01:41.540]   The, I'm working on a project with a guy named Chris Fritci
[02:01:41.540 --> 02:01:44.540]   in Texas and we've been working really hard
[02:01:44.540 --> 02:01:46.420]   on getting USDZ to work.
[02:01:46.420 --> 02:01:50.060]   And USDZ is something, is the 3D file format
[02:01:50.060 --> 02:01:52.340]   that you wanna use if you wanna bring it into motion.
[02:01:52.340 --> 02:01:53.380]   It's probably going to be the,
[02:01:53.380 --> 02:01:57.180]   well, it is going to be the core format for AR
[02:01:57.180 --> 02:02:01.380]   on the Mac platform or Apple products eventually.
[02:02:01.380 --> 02:02:03.140]   And you can do little previews
[02:02:03.140 --> 02:02:05.340]   and I don't have a great one to show at the moment,
[02:02:05.340 --> 02:02:08.700]   but the hardest part is getting the textured files.
[02:02:08.700 --> 02:02:10.100]   So you can make them in Moto
[02:02:10.100 --> 02:02:11.540]   or you can make them in Cinema 4D
[02:02:11.540 --> 02:02:13.660]   or you can build them in Blender,
[02:02:13.660 --> 02:02:15.900]   but getting them textured and looking nice
[02:02:15.900 --> 02:02:19.580]   and then being able to get them out to send to somebody
[02:02:19.580 --> 02:02:22.740]   is has proven to be very painful.
[02:02:22.740 --> 02:02:23.940]   (laughs)
[02:02:23.940 --> 02:02:27.100]   And we just really, we're at the bleeding edge
[02:02:27.100 --> 02:02:29.620]   and we really couldn't quite figure out how to do it.
[02:02:29.620 --> 02:02:33.300]   And Chris ran into, he started using Adobe Substance,
[02:02:33.300 --> 02:02:35.620]   which I kept on going like, oh, I should use this.
[02:02:35.620 --> 02:02:37.220]   I should download this.
[02:02:37.220 --> 02:02:39.540]   I know some of the folks that created it
[02:02:39.540 --> 02:02:41.820]   and I was like, felt guilty that I haven't used it
[02:02:41.820 --> 02:02:43.980]   and just hasn't, I haven't needed for projects.
[02:02:43.980 --> 02:02:46.340]   And he pulled it in and we started using it
[02:02:46.340 --> 02:02:48.860]   and it's kind of magical, you know,
[02:02:48.860 --> 02:02:50.660]   from a texturing perspective texture.
[02:02:50.660 --> 02:02:54.420]   So what it does is it lets you bring in a 3D object
[02:02:54.420 --> 02:02:57.740]   and you can find a lot of these 3D objects in,
[02:02:57.740 --> 02:03:00.860]   you know, you can get some of them free in Thingverse
[02:03:00.860 --> 02:03:02.420]   and you can buy them, of course,
[02:03:02.420 --> 02:03:03.900]   in places like TurboSquid.
[02:03:03.900 --> 02:03:05.860]   And they'll come to you as OBJ's typically
[02:03:05.860 --> 02:03:09.020]   and you can bring them in and very quickly
[02:03:09.020 --> 02:03:14.620]   texture map them, you know, and so the,
[02:03:14.620 --> 02:03:17.620]   so it's, what it does is it lets you add all those surfaces
[02:03:17.620 --> 02:03:21.380]   and the reason that I'm recommending it specifically
[02:03:21.380 --> 02:03:26.380]   is because it is, it allows you to texture them really quickly
[02:03:26.380 --> 02:03:29.340]   and then it allows you to export them as USDZ
[02:03:29.340 --> 02:03:31.860]   with all the different surface layers that you need.
[02:03:31.860 --> 02:03:35.580]   So being able to get this level of texture out of
[02:03:35.580 --> 02:03:38.140]   an OB, something inhabit, come in as USDZ
[02:03:38.140 --> 02:03:40.300]   and literally you can text it to somebody,
[02:03:40.300 --> 02:03:42.460]   like text the geometry to somebody
[02:03:42.460 --> 02:03:43.780]   and they can throw it in front of them.
[02:03:43.780 --> 02:03:47.340]   And this is the first application that I've seen
[02:03:47.340 --> 02:03:49.940]   that does this really easily and well
[02:03:49.940 --> 02:03:51.780]   and builds all the maps that you would need
[02:03:51.780 --> 02:03:52.780]   to make this look good.
[02:03:52.780 --> 02:03:56.500]   And so the one problem is that we're challenged with is
[02:03:56.500 --> 02:03:58.420]   it makes really big maps if you want to.
[02:03:58.420 --> 02:03:59.980]   So you have to figure out how to, you know,
[02:03:59.980 --> 02:04:02.860]   get them small enough that someone could show them on a phone,
[02:04:02.860 --> 02:04:04.620]   but, and I'll be able to show a little bit more of this
[02:04:04.620 --> 02:04:06.100]   in a couple of weeks when we're working on a product,
[02:04:06.100 --> 02:04:09.300]   that project that I can't show just yet to do this,
[02:04:09.300 --> 02:04:12.100]   but we're literally animating all the 3D objects
[02:04:12.100 --> 02:04:13.540]   that we're creating.
[02:04:13.540 --> 02:04:18.100]   They're being built in a mixture of Moto and Cinema 4D
[02:04:18.100 --> 02:04:22.380]   and then they are being, they're going through substance
[02:04:22.380 --> 02:04:23.980]   and then they go into motion.
[02:04:23.980 --> 02:04:27.580]   And so we're literally using motion as the 3D animation tool.
[02:04:27.580 --> 02:04:29.380]   - I can't believe they animate all of the stuff.
[02:04:29.380 --> 02:04:30.980]   This makes this look.
[02:04:30.980 --> 02:04:31.820]   - Oh yeah.
[02:04:31.820 --> 02:04:35.980]   - And it's, what they've really done well is,
[02:04:35.980 --> 02:04:40.300]   they made it easy, you know, so, so this is,
[02:04:40.300 --> 02:04:43.260]   I mean, from a 3D perspective, it's still probably a little
[02:04:43.260 --> 02:04:46.060]   bit of a lift for, if you've never used 3D before,
[02:04:46.060 --> 02:04:49.020]   but they really are looking around designers, you know,
[02:04:49.020 --> 02:04:52.420]   and having designers be able to very quickly add surfaces
[02:04:52.420 --> 02:04:55.500]   and it really is as easy as they're showing there.
[02:04:55.500 --> 02:04:57.620]   You just start adding these bits and pieces to it.
[02:04:57.620 --> 02:04:59.660]   - And using, you drag and drop them on.
[02:04:59.660 --> 02:05:01.580]   And but this has been a big missing piece for us.
[02:05:01.580 --> 02:05:06.580]   And it's just the interfaces, you know, very well done.
[02:05:06.580 --> 02:05:09.180]   And substance was a company that Adobe bought
[02:05:09.180 --> 02:05:10.380]   a little while ago.
[02:05:10.380 --> 02:05:13.780]   And so, and so it's, and I'm not usually, I have to admit,
[02:05:13.780 --> 02:05:18.420]   I've grown a little hesitant about the subscriptions
[02:05:18.420 --> 02:05:21.140]   that Adobe, you know, I don't like the model that much,
[02:05:21.140 --> 02:05:22.940]   but this is one that I'm, you know, I have,
[02:05:22.940 --> 02:05:24.740]   I got the 30 day to test it this week
[02:05:24.740 --> 02:05:25.940]   and I'm like, I'm gonna have to buy this
[02:05:25.940 --> 02:05:28.300]   'cause I'll use it all the time, you know, and.
[02:05:28.300 --> 02:05:30.620]   - If you had a full creative cloud subscription,
[02:05:30.620 --> 02:05:32.380]   you would have this.
[02:05:32.380 --> 02:05:33.500]   - I don't know if it's part of the,
[02:05:33.500 --> 02:05:35.580]   I don't know if it's part of a separate creative,
[02:05:35.580 --> 02:05:39.380]   when I, in my account, it shows up as a separate thing.
[02:05:39.380 --> 02:05:42.140]   I think if you have the full one, it may come with it.
[02:05:42.140 --> 02:05:43.820]   Because you can buy these in sections.
[02:05:43.820 --> 02:05:44.980]   - Cool.
[02:05:44.980 --> 02:05:49.980]   - It is, it's super cool, you know, and it's really,
[02:05:49.980 --> 02:05:55.100]   they've done a really good job, you know,
[02:05:55.100 --> 02:05:56.860]   of putting these together.
[02:05:56.860 --> 02:06:01.860]   And so, you know, again, I should have played with it earlier.
[02:06:01.860 --> 02:06:05.100]   - That's a lot of good examples.
[02:06:05.100 --> 02:06:07.940]   - But when I opened it, that's kind of why I wanted to,
[02:06:07.940 --> 02:06:09.140]   kind of throw it up there of like,
[02:06:09.140 --> 02:06:10.740]   hey, some people should pay attention to this
[02:06:10.740 --> 02:06:14.980]   because it is, it's pretty nifty.
[02:06:14.980 --> 02:06:17.100]   Hold on, let me see if I have, I think I might have a,
[02:06:17.100 --> 02:06:21.460]   here's a, I mean, this is one that I was playing with here.
[02:06:21.460 --> 02:06:22.980]   Let me see if I can pull this up.
[02:06:22.980 --> 02:06:24.660]   - These feel like they're actually,
[02:06:24.660 --> 02:06:26.620]   I mean, that's what makes a difference.
[02:06:26.620 --> 02:06:27.620]   These feel real.
[02:06:27.620 --> 02:06:30.060]   - So like, I'm gonna cut to this.
[02:06:30.060 --> 02:06:30.900]   - Go ahead and show us.
[02:06:30.900 --> 02:06:32.580]   - I just opened this in preview.
[02:06:32.580 --> 02:06:34.940]   Like this is just in Apple's preview.
[02:06:34.940 --> 02:06:36.780]   In this couch, I download, I paid it.
[02:06:36.780 --> 02:06:39.180]   - Preview will open up a 3D object like that later.
[02:06:39.180 --> 02:06:40.340]   - A USDC file.
[02:06:40.340 --> 02:06:41.580]   - Oh my God, that's cool.
[02:06:41.580 --> 02:06:42.580]   - Yeah, this is in.
[02:06:42.580 --> 02:06:44.020]   - I had no idea.
[02:06:44.020 --> 02:06:45.020]   - And I could text this.
[02:06:45.020 --> 02:06:45.860]   - Keep showing Alex this.
[02:06:45.860 --> 02:06:46.780]   - There you go.
[02:06:46.780 --> 02:06:50.100]   - And I could probably, I mean, I could probably text it to you
[02:06:50.100 --> 02:06:52.020]   and it would just show up on your phone
[02:06:52.020 --> 02:06:53.420]   and then you could place it somewhere.
[02:06:53.420 --> 02:06:54.740]   - That's wild.
[02:06:54.740 --> 02:06:56.540]   - So this is supported in the OS.
[02:06:56.540 --> 02:06:57.900]   And so, and this was literally.
[02:06:57.900 --> 02:07:01.060]   - You've been singing the phrases of this USDC format
[02:07:01.060 --> 02:07:03.740]   for a while, but now I really comes home if it's all.
[02:07:03.740 --> 02:07:04.580]   - Yeah.
[02:07:04.580 --> 02:07:06.780]   - It's all supported by all of Apple's stuff.
[02:07:06.780 --> 02:07:09.180]   - Everything is supporting this model format.
[02:07:09.180 --> 02:07:12.260]   And this is, this, and I put this into substance
[02:07:12.260 --> 02:07:14.740]   and literally textured this in like 10 minutes.
[02:07:14.740 --> 02:07:17.300]   - Nice, worn leather looks much more real.
[02:07:17.300 --> 02:07:18.780]   - It's all just a shader that was built in.
[02:07:18.780 --> 02:07:19.700]   I didn't pay anything for it.
[02:07:19.700 --> 02:07:21.460]   I just grabbed it, dragged it on.
[02:07:21.460 --> 02:07:23.820]   - Here, you, you, and you, and then that was it.
[02:07:23.820 --> 02:07:25.660]   And so it was like something I bought.
[02:07:25.660 --> 02:07:28.460]   It's a cheap model that I bought on TurboSquid,
[02:07:28.460 --> 02:07:30.260]   downloaded it, threw it into substance.
[02:07:30.260 --> 02:07:33.420]   And this is just, again, this is just in preview,
[02:07:33.420 --> 02:07:35.100]   but I can put this also into motion
[02:07:35.100 --> 02:07:37.660]   and I can animate around it and do all the other things I want.
[02:07:37.660 --> 02:07:39.780]   Or I can send it to you and say,
[02:07:39.780 --> 02:07:41.460]   this is the thing we were thinking about
[02:07:41.460 --> 02:07:44.060]   and you can put it into your living room, you know?
[02:07:44.060 --> 02:07:46.100]   And see if that's what you want, you know?
[02:07:46.100 --> 02:07:48.500]   - Can I get something in the brown
[02:07:48.500 --> 02:07:50.460]   with a little distressed, kind of like,
[02:07:50.460 --> 02:07:53.620]   - It looks like an old library leather sofa.
[02:07:53.620 --> 02:07:54.980]   - I could totally do it.
[02:07:54.980 --> 02:07:55.820]   - I totally do it.
[02:07:55.820 --> 02:07:56.660]   - Steve Jobs, I've had a chair.
[02:07:56.660 --> 02:07:57.500]   - I've got a lot of fun.
[02:07:57.500 --> 02:07:59.140]   - I'm still learning how to use it, but yeah.
[02:07:59.140 --> 02:08:02.820]   - That's really amazing in the fact that preview just opens it.
[02:08:02.820 --> 02:08:04.940]   - Oh yeah, well, and not only that,
[02:08:04.940 --> 02:08:06.540]   when you think about the three models
[02:08:06.540 --> 02:08:08.940]   and pages and all that too.
[02:08:08.940 --> 02:08:10.020]   - They don't support that yet.
[02:08:10.020 --> 02:08:10.860]   - Oh, they get bored.
[02:08:10.860 --> 02:08:14.540]   - I mean, we all think that eventually that'll happen.
[02:08:14.540 --> 02:08:16.340]   But what's interesting is like in motion,
[02:08:16.340 --> 02:08:17.980]   I could build, like if I have an engine,
[02:08:17.980 --> 02:08:21.260]   I could build it so that it would pull apart in motion,
[02:08:21.260 --> 02:08:22.820]   I can animate all those bits and pieces.
[02:08:22.820 --> 02:08:25.180]   But then I can publish the controls
[02:08:25.180 --> 02:08:26.900]   for those to a little slider.
[02:08:26.900 --> 02:08:28.980]   So I can just, when I slide this open,
[02:08:28.980 --> 02:08:30.820]   it'll just open up like that.
[02:08:30.820 --> 02:08:33.220]   And then I can publish that as a generator to Final Cut.
[02:08:33.220 --> 02:08:35.380]   And so now in Final Cut, the editor doesn't need to know
[02:08:35.380 --> 02:08:36.220]   anything about 3D, they're like,
[02:08:36.220 --> 02:08:37.540]   "I just want to do the exploding thing."
[02:08:37.540 --> 02:08:39.860]   And it just goes, you know, it'll just open up.
[02:08:39.860 --> 02:08:40.820]   That's what I'm working on right now
[02:08:40.820 --> 02:08:42.140]   for some other things we're working on.
[02:08:42.140 --> 02:08:45.100]   And so the thing is that, and again,
[02:08:45.100 --> 02:08:47.500]   I can send that to you, you know, with some code,
[02:08:47.500 --> 02:08:49.940]   you could also take that and, you know,
[02:08:49.940 --> 02:08:52.020]   we could put that into something for education.
[02:08:52.020 --> 02:08:54.380]   When you think about education, when you think about
[02:08:54.380 --> 02:08:57.260]   how it impacts, you know, corporate stuff,
[02:08:57.260 --> 02:08:59.220]   I have a product that I want to show you,
[02:08:59.220 --> 02:09:01.060]   and you can look at it right in front of you.
[02:09:01.060 --> 02:09:02.980]   And all of that stuff is being supported at the OS.
[02:09:02.980 --> 02:09:05.220]   The real problem and the reason I'm talking about substance
[02:09:05.220 --> 02:09:07.380]   is because we just really had a hard time
[02:09:07.380 --> 02:09:08.900]   making the models look great.
[02:09:08.900 --> 02:09:10.340]   Like we could see what was possible,
[02:09:10.340 --> 02:09:12.060]   we just couldn't make them.
[02:09:12.060 --> 02:09:14.820]   You know, and Chris ran into this thing
[02:09:14.820 --> 02:09:15.740]   and started showing it.
[02:09:15.740 --> 02:09:16.580]   And so we're going to do it.
[02:09:16.580 --> 02:09:17.820]   We're going to talk, we're going to do second hours
[02:09:17.820 --> 02:09:21.580]   and office hours about it and get everybody kind of,
[02:09:21.580 --> 02:09:23.820]   you know, trained up.
[02:09:23.820 --> 02:09:24.860]   You know, as soon as I figure stuff out,
[02:09:24.860 --> 02:09:26.340]   I'm like, okay, I gotta go.
[02:09:26.340 --> 02:09:27.580]   I gotta go to office hours.
[02:09:27.580 --> 02:09:28.860]   - Gonna be two channels soon.
[02:09:28.860 --> 02:09:30.980]   - 40 hours a day of office hours.
[02:09:30.980 --> 02:09:33.060]   - Yeah, yeah, so, but I think that we're going to do
[02:09:33.060 --> 02:09:36.140]   some labs and after hours and then the second hour
[02:09:36.140 --> 02:09:37.060]   and office hours to do it.
[02:09:37.060 --> 02:09:40.820]   But it's a pipeline that I think is,
[02:09:40.820 --> 02:09:45.100]   you know, I would highly recommend thinking very hard
[02:09:45.100 --> 02:09:47.340]   about learning how to do this right now
[02:09:47.340 --> 02:09:52.260]   because this is going to be a really big industry,
[02:09:52.260 --> 02:09:53.980]   you know, as we move forward, you know,
[02:09:53.980 --> 02:09:55.980]   as soon as it's a little bit more widely available
[02:09:55.980 --> 02:09:57.580]   and I think it's been a slow rollout
[02:09:57.580 --> 02:10:00.460]   and this has been a opening this up has been like this
[02:10:00.460 --> 02:10:04.220]   big piece of it, you know, for us.
[02:10:04.220 --> 02:10:06.580]   And so, but I think that if someone's trying to figure out
[02:10:06.580 --> 02:10:10.980]   how to be higher-able next year or the year after,
[02:10:10.980 --> 02:10:14.060]   you know, it's not something that you can spend 40 hours
[02:10:14.060 --> 02:10:16.700]   a week on, but it could be worth understanding how it works
[02:10:16.700 --> 02:10:18.100]   because it's now gotten so easy.
[02:10:18.100 --> 02:10:22.060]   I mean, I've been doing 3D modeling since 1980s,
[02:10:22.060 --> 02:10:25.740]   like, '88, '89 and it's just stunning
[02:10:25.740 --> 02:10:28.380]   like what we're at, you know, as far as how to do this.
[02:10:28.380 --> 02:10:29.220]   - Super cool.
[02:10:29.220 --> 02:10:30.060]   - Anyway, check it out.
[02:10:30.060 --> 02:10:30.900]   - Super cool.
[02:10:30.900 --> 02:10:34.860]   - Substance, it's actually a bunch of different
[02:10:34.860 --> 02:10:37.140]   40 programs. - Yeah, there's.
[02:10:37.140 --> 02:10:40.860]   - And they did, they've done just such a good job.
[02:10:40.860 --> 02:10:43.380]   You know, I mean, it's, it's a, again, it's not,
[02:10:43.380 --> 02:10:45.620]   even though it's new to Adobe, it is not,
[02:10:45.620 --> 02:10:49.140]   it's not, it's a very mature app.
[02:10:49.140 --> 02:10:53.060]   You know, it's, you know, it's not, it's, you know,
[02:10:53.060 --> 02:10:56.300]   Sebastian DeGai, who is the founder of Substance,
[02:10:56.300 --> 02:10:59.820]   you know, that's who Algorithmic was the company
[02:10:59.820 --> 02:11:04.820]   that Adobe bought and, you know, he's been doing that.
[02:11:04.820 --> 02:11:07.220]   He and I have known each other for 15 years.
[02:11:07.220 --> 02:11:08.900]   He's been working on this for a long time.
[02:11:08.900 --> 02:11:10.260]   So it's a very mature app.
[02:11:10.260 --> 02:11:13.100]   You know, so it's really interesting.
[02:11:13.100 --> 02:11:14.300]   - I would, I would highly recommend
[02:11:14.300 --> 02:11:17.340]   Downloading's 30 day demo, just download it and play with it.
[02:11:17.340 --> 02:11:20.380]   - And by the way, the student and teacher price
[02:11:20.380 --> 02:11:22.460]   is a little bit more affordable.
[02:11:22.460 --> 02:11:25.140]   So, you know, that's for all apps.
[02:11:25.140 --> 02:11:26.260]   So, yeah.
[02:11:26.260 --> 02:11:27.100]   - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:11:27.100 --> 02:11:28.700]   And it's, yeah, really.
[02:11:28.700 --> 02:11:30.660]   - Doesn't look like substance.
[02:11:30.660 --> 02:11:31.500]   Yeah, that's smart.
[02:11:31.500 --> 02:11:32.320]   - It might be separate.
[02:11:32.320 --> 02:11:34.340]   - It's separate, sold separately.
[02:11:34.340 --> 02:11:35.160]   - Oh well.
[02:11:35.160 --> 02:11:37.460]   Thank you.
[02:11:37.460 --> 02:11:39.140]   That's a really cool demo.
[02:11:39.140 --> 02:11:41.340]   Watch the video on the Substance page.
[02:11:41.340 --> 02:11:42.540]   That's really neat.
[02:11:42.540 --> 02:11:44.500]   Andy, what do you got for us?
[02:11:44.500 --> 02:11:47.660]   - Oh boy, what was I happy when this was released?
[02:11:47.660 --> 02:11:50.140]   Logitech used to make my favorite
[02:11:50.140 --> 02:11:53.500]   like mobile Bluetooth keyboard, the K811.
[02:11:53.500 --> 02:11:56.100]   And when someone can remember the model number
[02:11:56.100 --> 02:11:59.500]   that's that obscure, you know that it was such a,
[02:11:59.500 --> 02:12:01.660]   it was my favorite travel keyboard,
[02:12:01.660 --> 02:12:03.740]   whether I'm gonna be working for three hours
[02:12:03.740 --> 02:12:06.780]   of the coffee shop or working for like two days
[02:12:06.780 --> 02:12:08.740]   just to go out and get a meeting.
[02:12:08.740 --> 02:12:10.780]   Because there are a lot of really good cheap
[02:12:10.780 --> 02:12:11.580]   Bluetooth keyboards.
[02:12:11.580 --> 02:12:13.300]   There aren't a whole lot of them that are designed
[02:12:13.300 --> 02:12:16.060]   to be typed on thousands of words a day,
[02:12:16.060 --> 02:12:17.140]   day after day after day,
[02:12:17.140 --> 02:12:18.780]   and have all these creature come from features.
[02:12:18.780 --> 02:12:21.220]   They discontinued it, which broke my heart a few months ago.
[02:12:21.220 --> 02:12:23.260]   Actually went on eBay and bought a couple of used ones
[02:12:23.260 --> 02:12:25.140]   'cause you always have to have your favorite keyboard
[02:12:25.140 --> 02:12:25.980]   backups of it.
[02:12:25.980 --> 02:12:27.300]   But it looks like they're replacing it
[02:12:27.300 --> 02:12:30.820]   with this new one called the Logitech MX Keys Mini,
[02:12:30.820 --> 02:12:34.140]   which is, it takes everything I liked about the K811.
[02:12:34.140 --> 02:12:39.140]   And they've upgraded it to their new keyboard switch design,
[02:12:39.700 --> 02:12:43.860]   which is easily the equal of any premium notebook,
[02:12:43.860 --> 02:12:45.900]   probably better, unless it's the MacBook Pro,
[02:12:45.900 --> 02:12:47.540]   in which case it's better than that.
[02:12:47.540 --> 02:12:50.740]   We're talking about like the 1.8 millimeters of travel,
[02:12:50.740 --> 02:12:52.540]   so big, comfortable travel.
[02:12:52.540 --> 02:12:54.140]   This is the sort of thing that once again,
[02:12:54.140 --> 02:12:55.820]   it's not for bashing out a couple of emails,
[02:12:55.820 --> 02:12:57.900]   it's not for like navigating through apps.
[02:12:57.900 --> 02:13:00.620]   It really is for people who are gonna be writing, writing,
[02:13:00.620 --> 02:13:04.340]   writing, using that keyboard day in and day out,
[02:13:04.340 --> 02:13:07.560]   while being small enough and lasting long enough on battery
[02:13:07.560 --> 02:13:09.380]   that you can toss it in a bag
[02:13:09.380 --> 02:13:11.980]   so that I do have the keyboard cover for my iPad Pro.
[02:13:11.980 --> 02:13:13.900]   But when I leave the house with the intention
[02:13:13.900 --> 02:13:16.660]   that I have writing targets for the day,
[02:13:16.660 --> 02:13:18.780]   I will more likely just take my smart cover
[02:13:18.780 --> 02:13:20.460]   and this keyboard 'cause it's gonna be
[02:13:20.460 --> 02:13:22.060]   so much more comfortable.
[02:13:22.060 --> 02:13:22.980]   Built really, really well.
[02:13:22.980 --> 02:13:24.940]   In addition to the key switches being really nice,
[02:13:24.940 --> 02:13:26.900]   it's backlit, it will automatically sense
[02:13:26.900 --> 02:13:28.540]   when your hands are near, so it will turn the lights on
[02:13:28.540 --> 02:13:30.300]   and off for you automatically.
[02:13:30.300 --> 02:13:32.660]   It has, what I love about this though,
[02:13:32.660 --> 02:13:35.820]   is that it carries over my favorite feature from the K811.
[02:13:35.820 --> 02:13:38.220]   You can pair it with up to three different devices
[02:13:38.220 --> 02:13:39.300]   simultaneously.
[02:13:39.300 --> 02:13:43.220]   So like at the coffee shop, I might have my iPad in front of me,
[02:13:43.220 --> 02:13:45.540]   but I also have my phone next to it in my office.
[02:13:45.540 --> 02:13:48.340]   I will have that in maybe a Windows laptop.
[02:13:48.340 --> 02:13:50.380]   I don't have to like switch and repair
[02:13:50.380 --> 02:13:51.380]   to switch between these two.
[02:13:51.380 --> 02:13:54.260]   All I have to do is, if suddenly I'm getting text messages
[02:13:54.260 --> 02:13:55.820]   from someone and I need to have a conversation
[02:13:55.820 --> 02:13:57.780]   with them on my phone, all I have to do is press
[02:13:57.780 --> 02:14:01.020]   a dedicated button that's dedicated to the pairing
[02:14:01.020 --> 02:14:03.580]   of that phone, the pairing switches immediately
[02:14:03.580 --> 02:14:05.220]   to the pairing for that phone
[02:14:05.220 --> 02:14:06.980]   and without any interruption whatsoever,
[02:14:06.980 --> 02:14:09.420]   I'm typing on that phone instead.
[02:14:09.420 --> 02:14:11.540]   So it's not cheap, it is 99 bucks,
[02:14:11.540 --> 02:14:14.260]   which is easily as much money as,
[02:14:14.260 --> 02:14:16.460]   it's as much money as Apple's really, really cool.
[02:14:16.460 --> 02:14:19.420]   Hey, aren't I fancy keyboard here?
[02:14:19.420 --> 02:14:21.580]   But it's much, much better, it's much easier to type on,
[02:14:21.580 --> 02:14:23.180]   has much more features.
[02:14:23.180 --> 02:14:28.180]   And although it's $70 more than their K380 keyboard,
[02:14:28.180 --> 02:14:31.220]   the K380 is the casual keyboard for people
[02:14:31.220 --> 02:14:34.820]   who just want a mobile keyboard for attached to
[02:14:34.820 --> 02:14:38.780]   a desktop PC or whatever, this is really designed
[02:14:38.780 --> 02:14:41.700]   for creatives and it kind of reflects that.
[02:14:41.700 --> 02:14:44.380]   So I'm so excited about it because I actually have,
[02:14:44.380 --> 02:14:45.380]   don't actually don't have it yet,
[02:14:45.380 --> 02:14:48.020]   I ordered it two days ago and I can't wait for it to come in,
[02:14:48.020 --> 02:14:48.860]   but I hope you guys-
[02:14:48.860 --> 02:14:50.660]   - I'm a pink one, I'm just saying.
[02:14:50.660 --> 02:14:53.500]   - We call it salmon.
[02:14:53.500 --> 02:14:55.460]   (laughing)
[02:14:55.460 --> 02:14:57.140]   Don't let the other night think.
[02:14:57.140 --> 02:15:00.620]   It knows that like there's a variable in pink, black,
[02:15:00.620 --> 02:15:02.860]   the graphite gray, so if those of you
[02:15:02.860 --> 02:15:05.140]   who like to be matchy, matchy with your hardware,
[02:15:05.140 --> 02:15:06.540]   we'll probably enjoy it too.
[02:15:06.540 --> 02:15:07.700]   And it has some nice things too,
[02:15:07.700 --> 02:15:09.740]   it has doubles keys for,
[02:15:09.740 --> 02:15:11.500]   so if you're switching between like a Windows machine
[02:15:11.500 --> 02:15:13.820]   and a Mac, it will have both sets of keys.
[02:15:13.820 --> 02:15:17.700]   It has dedicated, you can tell it was designed for 2021
[02:15:17.700 --> 02:15:20.500]   because it has a dedicated key for emojis.
[02:15:20.500 --> 02:15:22.980]   It also has a dedicated microphone mute key
[02:15:22.980 --> 02:15:25.660]   so that you don't have to hunt to find it in Skype
[02:15:25.660 --> 02:15:28.060]   or meetings or whatever, it is a dedicated key
[02:15:28.060 --> 02:15:30.060]   that's mapped to the right thing.
[02:15:30.060 --> 02:15:32.540]   On and on and on, just so much nice thought went into this.
[02:15:32.540 --> 02:15:34.580]   I know it's difficult for me to,
[02:15:34.580 --> 02:15:37.980]   I really recommend things that I haven't actually used yet,
[02:15:37.980 --> 02:15:40.700]   but I've had enough experience with the K811
[02:15:40.700 --> 02:15:43.620]   that I know that I recognize everything that I like about this
[02:15:43.620 --> 02:15:46.780]   and I have tried typing on this type of key switch before
[02:15:46.780 --> 02:15:51.220]   and it is my favorite like quiet low profile notebook style
[02:15:51.220 --> 02:15:53.740]   keyboard switch that it's,
[02:15:53.740 --> 02:15:56.140]   I wish that Apple would hire a way
[02:15:56.140 --> 02:15:59.100]   whoever it is at Logitech designed these keycaps,
[02:15:59.100 --> 02:16:00.700]   but Logitech is probably way too smart
[02:16:00.700 --> 02:16:02.620]   to let that person go away.
[02:16:02.620 --> 02:16:05.220]   - Very good, very good.
[02:16:05.220 --> 02:16:06.820]   - Thank you, Andy.
[02:16:06.820 --> 02:16:09.820]   WGBH Boston this week.
[02:16:09.820 --> 02:16:12.860]   Yes, Friday at 1.20 PM, you can stream it live or later
[02:16:12.860 --> 02:16:15.380]   by going to WGBHNews.org.
[02:16:15.380 --> 02:16:16.500]   - Nice.
[02:16:16.500 --> 02:16:18.820]   ReneeRitchie, YouTube.com/ReneeRitchie,
[02:16:18.820 --> 02:16:21.220]   what are you working on this week?
[02:16:21.220 --> 02:16:24.700]   - I posted my really long, really in-depth A15
[02:16:24.700 --> 02:16:25.980]   bionic deep dive.
[02:16:25.980 --> 02:16:26.820]   - Nice.
[02:16:26.820 --> 02:16:28.500]   - 20 minutes of fun and silicon.
[02:16:28.500 --> 02:16:31.740]   And then I just posted an Apple October event,
[02:16:31.740 --> 02:16:33.380]   or October, November event preview,
[02:16:33.380 --> 02:16:35.420]   a Mac and one X Mac event preview
[02:16:35.420 --> 02:16:36.780]   and what I'm hoping we get.
[02:16:36.780 --> 02:16:38.700]   - Oh, I hope it comes soon.
[02:16:38.700 --> 02:16:39.540]   - Soon.
[02:16:39.540 --> 02:16:40.380]   - I know I need it.
[02:16:40.380 --> 02:16:41.220]   I want it.
[02:16:41.220 --> 02:16:42.660]   - You gave me a phrase.
[02:16:42.660 --> 02:16:45.220]   I saw the teaser for that in my YouTube descriptions
[02:16:45.220 --> 02:16:46.980]   this morning, I'm like, oh, Apple announced something.
[02:16:46.980 --> 02:16:48.140]   I didn't know it was an event.
[02:16:48.140 --> 02:16:49.900]   I wasn't yet like, oh, it's just,
[02:16:49.900 --> 02:16:51.140]   I'm sure it's going to be great.
[02:16:51.140 --> 02:16:51.980]   - There were jerks on Twitter today.
[02:16:51.980 --> 02:16:53.140]   It was like, the event is announced.
[02:16:53.140 --> 02:16:53.980]   It's a pixel.
[02:16:53.980 --> 02:16:54.820]   I'm like, oh, dude.
[02:16:54.820 --> 02:16:57.340]   (grunting)
[02:16:57.340 --> 02:16:58.580]   - So it's probably not next week.
[02:16:58.580 --> 02:16:59.940]   It's probably not this month.
[02:16:59.940 --> 02:17:01.220]   I'm going to bet it's in November,
[02:17:01.220 --> 02:17:02.540]   but we shall see.
[02:17:02.540 --> 02:17:04.580]   - Last week of October, first week of November.
[02:17:04.580 --> 02:17:05.420]   - Yeah, it's good.
[02:17:05.420 --> 02:17:06.420]   - Something like that, yeah.
[02:17:06.420 --> 02:17:07.580]   - I'll be gone.
[02:17:07.580 --> 02:17:08.980]   I'll be in Mexico.
[02:17:08.980 --> 02:17:09.820]   - Well then it's for sure.
[02:17:09.820 --> 02:17:11.580]   - You guys, have fun.
[02:17:11.580 --> 02:17:12.620]   Do it without me.
[02:17:12.620 --> 02:17:13.860]   - LaPoulette's leaving.
[02:17:13.860 --> 02:17:14.700]   - Okay.
[02:17:14.700 --> 02:17:15.540]   - It's the event.
[02:17:15.540 --> 02:17:16.460]   (laughing)
[02:17:16.460 --> 02:17:17.580]   - And of course, Alex Lindsey,
[02:17:17.580 --> 02:17:22.060]   office hours dot global for this global phenomenon.
[02:17:22.060 --> 02:17:23.900]   What have you been,
[02:17:23.900 --> 02:17:25.940]   what have you been working on this week?
[02:17:25.940 --> 02:17:27.620]   - Oh, well, it's busy.
[02:17:27.620 --> 02:17:29.820]   We actually today had a great,
[02:17:29.820 --> 02:17:32.060]   it was just what we call ruthless reviews for audio
[02:17:32.060 --> 02:17:33.940]   where we literally just pick at everybody's audio.
[02:17:33.940 --> 02:17:36.540]   Like, I hear a little hiss in the background.
[02:17:36.540 --> 02:17:39.420]   And or, you know, your voice isn't quite as full
[02:17:39.420 --> 02:17:40.540]   as it could be with that mic.
[02:17:40.540 --> 02:17:43.180]   And so it's a really funny, but you learn a lot here.
[02:17:43.180 --> 02:17:46.860]   - You know, and your system is so mature now
[02:17:46.860 --> 02:17:48.300]   that you're turning against each other.
[02:17:48.300 --> 02:17:50.300]   That's a right of path.
[02:17:50.300 --> 02:17:51.620]   (laughing)
[02:17:51.620 --> 02:17:54.420]   - Well, it's like there's no one to really compete with
[02:17:54.420 --> 02:17:56.820]   when it comes to like how you look and sound over Zoom anymore.
[02:17:56.820 --> 02:17:59.220]   So we just have to keep playing against ourselves, you know?
[02:17:59.220 --> 02:18:00.340]   And so, yeah.
[02:18:00.340 --> 02:18:02.620]   So that was a lot of fun today.
[02:18:02.620 --> 02:18:04.420]   We're talking about tomorrow,
[02:18:04.420 --> 02:18:06.500]   we're talking about actually about a HTML based
[02:18:06.500 --> 02:18:08.180]   graphic system for broadcast.
[02:18:08.180 --> 02:18:12.700]   It's called SPX GC and then Thursday.
[02:18:12.700 --> 02:18:15.380]   So we opened up, we recommended keynote last week
[02:18:15.380 --> 02:18:18.460]   and then we opened up and started playing with it as a group.
[02:18:18.460 --> 02:18:20.740]   Then it was mind blowing the live video input.
[02:18:20.740 --> 02:18:22.820]   It wasn't like, oh, I can put a video next to it.
[02:18:22.820 --> 02:18:24.340]   It's a video is an object.
[02:18:24.340 --> 02:18:26.580]   That can be treated like any other object in keynote.
[02:18:26.580 --> 02:18:29.380]   So we're spending a whole hour on Thursday talking about that
[02:18:29.380 --> 02:18:30.220]   and how it works.
[02:18:30.220 --> 02:18:33.740]   And then we have a colorist, Charles Klein from New York
[02:18:33.740 --> 02:18:34.820]   who's gonna come in and talk about,
[02:18:34.820 --> 02:18:38.180]   we've been starting to color correct our cameras with LUTs.
[02:18:38.180 --> 02:18:41.420]   So using resolve and in color correcting the cameras
[02:18:41.420 --> 02:18:43.900]   with charts and being able to,
[02:18:43.900 --> 02:18:46.300]   rather than using a switcher or using shader,
[02:18:46.300 --> 02:18:47.420]   you know, shading systems,
[02:18:47.420 --> 02:18:50.700]   we're just literally using a LUT to correct the cameras
[02:18:50.700 --> 02:18:51.980]   and match them to each other.
[02:18:51.980 --> 02:18:53.260]   So we're gonna talk about how to do that.
[02:18:53.260 --> 02:18:54.900]   And then of course on Saturday,
[02:18:54.900 --> 02:18:56.140]   not only are we talking about education,
[02:18:56.140 --> 02:18:57.260]   but we're making chai together.
[02:18:57.260 --> 02:18:58.540]   We're gonna learn how to make chai from--
[02:18:58.540 --> 02:18:59.540]   - Oh, that one.
[02:18:59.540 --> 02:19:04.540]   - The Mianti Gajar in South Africa.
[02:19:04.540 --> 02:19:06.980]   She's gonna teach us all how to make authentic chai
[02:19:06.980 --> 02:19:08.620]   and we're gonna do it all together over Zoom.
[02:19:08.620 --> 02:19:12.180]   So it's a very wide range, as always, in office hours.
[02:19:12.180 --> 02:19:13.500]   And then we've now started,
[02:19:13.500 --> 02:19:15.260]   we've run out of time in office hours.
[02:19:15.260 --> 02:19:16.980]   So in after hours, we're now doing labs.
[02:19:16.980 --> 02:19:18.500]   So the next Thursday and Friday,
[02:19:18.500 --> 02:19:20.100]   we're doing labs on a program called Isadora,
[02:19:20.100 --> 02:19:21.580]   which I think I recommended a couple of weeks ago
[02:19:21.580 --> 02:19:26.020]   that is like this nodal brain
[02:19:26.020 --> 02:19:27.980]   that lets you take inputs and outputs.
[02:19:27.980 --> 02:19:29.820]   And we're running our switchers with it
[02:19:29.820 --> 02:19:30.900]   and all kinds of other stuffs.
[02:19:30.900 --> 02:19:33.380]   But there's a lot of people that wanna are watching us do it
[02:19:33.380 --> 02:19:34.620]   and wanna figure out how to do it.
[02:19:34.620 --> 02:19:36.940]   So we're getting some pretty smart people together
[02:19:36.940 --> 02:19:39.260]   and we're just gonna spend an hour a couple times a week
[02:19:39.260 --> 02:19:40.540]   to get up to speed.
[02:19:40.540 --> 02:19:44.720]   So it's a still, I'm always still amazed,
[02:19:44.720 --> 02:19:47.260]   550 some episodes.
[02:19:47.260 --> 02:19:49.180]   - And you had Elmo of Elmo,
[02:19:49.180 --> 02:19:50.940]   grandma got run over by a reindeer.
[02:19:50.940 --> 02:19:53.140]   So it really covers everything.
[02:19:53.140 --> 02:19:55.820]   - It goes exactly, exactly.
[02:19:55.820 --> 02:19:56.740]   - Yeah.
[02:19:56.740 --> 02:19:58.500]   - Office hours.global.
[02:19:58.500 --> 02:19:59.500]   - It's a phenomenon.
[02:19:59.500 --> 02:20:00.580]   That's all I can say.
[02:20:00.580 --> 02:20:01.820]   It's amazing.
[02:20:01.820 --> 02:20:02.660]   - A lot of fun.
[02:20:02.660 --> 02:20:03.500]   - Thank you, Alex.
[02:20:03.500 --> 02:20:04.340]   Thank you, Andy.
[02:20:04.340 --> 02:20:05.180]   Thank you, Renee.
[02:20:05.180 --> 02:20:06.020]   We do Mac Break Week.
[02:20:06.020 --> 02:20:07.500]   Thank you for joining us.
[02:20:07.500 --> 02:20:10.340]   You can watch us do the show live at Mac Break Weekly.
[02:20:10.340 --> 02:20:14.140]   Well, I guess the best place to go to twit.tv/live.
[02:20:14.140 --> 02:20:17.380]   There's live audio and video streams there.
[02:20:17.380 --> 02:20:21.940]   Tuesday morning, lemon am Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern, 1800 UTC.

[02:20:23.460 --> 02:20:25.780]   there's two places to do that are free IRC,
[02:20:25.780 --> 02:20:27.180]   irc.twit.tv.
[02:20:27.180 --> 02:20:30.300]   And of course club twit members get access to our Discord.
[02:20:30.300 --> 02:20:31.460]   If you're not a member of Club Twit,
[02:20:31.460 --> 02:20:33.700]   seven bucks a month gets you ad free versions
[02:20:33.700 --> 02:20:35.100]   of all of our shows.
[02:20:35.100 --> 02:20:38.060]   Our great Discord server 24/7
[02:20:38.060 --> 02:20:39.980]   and the Twit Plus feed with content
[02:20:39.980 --> 02:20:42.980]   that doesn't make it into the other podcasts.
[02:20:42.980 --> 02:20:44.460]   For more information about Club Twit,
[02:20:44.460 --> 02:20:46.540]   go to twit.tv/clubtwit.
[02:20:46.540 --> 02:20:50.340]   You're really gonna wanna be a member for this Friday.
[02:20:50.340 --> 02:20:53.140]   Steve Gibson's doing an AMA in Club Twit.
[02:20:53.140 --> 02:20:55.300]   That will be very interesting.
[02:20:55.300 --> 02:20:56.740]   So if you're Steve Gibson fan,
[02:20:56.740 --> 02:20:58.980]   you may wanna sign up quick.
[02:20:58.980 --> 02:21:00.060]   You know, it's month to month.
[02:21:00.060 --> 02:21:02.300]   You could sign up just for a month.
[02:21:02.300 --> 02:21:03.580]   And then quit.
[02:21:03.580 --> 02:21:05.260]   I think Steve's worth seven bucks.
[02:21:05.260 --> 02:21:07.780]   After the fact on demand versions
[02:21:07.780 --> 02:21:11.140]   of all of our shows are available at twit.tv/
[02:21:11.140 --> 02:21:15.940]   well, at the website twit.tv for this shows twit.tv/mbw.

[02:21:21.340 --> 02:21:24.020]   Best way to get the show, I guess, would be subscribed.
[02:21:24.020 --> 02:21:25.140]   That way you get it automatically.
[02:21:25.140 --> 02:21:27.660]   The minute it's available audio or video.
