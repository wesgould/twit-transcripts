[00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.140]   It's time for MacBreak Weekly, a chance
[00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.880]   to look at the latest from Apple.
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.780]   And a little bit delayed today because yesterday,
[00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.680]   Apple made its big announcement.
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.420]   "Let's rock," said Apple.
[00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.820]   And none of us were there.
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.820]   Oh, so we've decided to have somebody who wasn't there
[00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:30.820]   because he was overseas.
[00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.320]   He had a good excuse.
[00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.560]   Robert Llewellyn is here, Creighton from Red Dwarf.
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.020]   And he's a big Mac fan.
[00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.660]   And you probably saw his interview.
[00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.500]   We did a couple of weeks ago on Twit Live.
[00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.100]   Robert, Bob, I guess I can call you.
[00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.500]   It's great to have you.
[00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:45.600]   It's very good to be here.
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.200]   It's really an extraordinary experience.
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.140]   I'm stuck in London in the middle of the mountain.
[00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.840]   I'm talking to you, because--
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.240]   As long as we're talking to Brits,
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.480]   I should get Don McAllister on the line, too.
[00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:56.840]   Let me see if I can pull him up.
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.480]   And we can have somebody from Liverpool representing.
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:00.480]   Oh, no, we're good.
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.680]   Then we'll have the whole thing.
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.780]   Let me just invite Don to join us.
[00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.120]   And then, of course, Chris Breen, who was actually
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.220]   at the event.
[00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.720]   Yeah, I was there.
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.320]   From Macworld Magazine.
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.420]   And every time we've had Chris on in the past,
[00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.560]   it's been so difficult.
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.900]   His Skype has dropped out every three minutes
[00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.660]   because he lives in the boonies, which is actually
[00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.200]   San Francisco Bay Area.
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.200]   Yeah, it's a beautiful boony.
[00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.560]   And then there's Don McAllister.
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.760]   Hi, Don.
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:27.460]   Hi, Leo.
[00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:28.160]   How are you doing?
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.300]   Last minute, I forgot to tell you we changed the time,
[00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.100]   but I think you figured it out.
[00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.900]   I sorted it out, no worries.
[00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.040]   Thank you so much.
[00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.640]   So Don is from Liverpool.
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.340]   He is the host of ScreenCasts online at screencastonline.com.
[00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.440]   Are you in London, Bob?
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.580]   Where are you?
[00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:45.580]   I'm in London.
[00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:46.680]   I mean, yes, I don't normally live here,
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:47.780]   but I'm in my apartment in London.
[00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:48.780]   My flat.
[00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:49.780]   My flat.
[00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:50.280]   My flat.
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.680]   My flat on London.
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.720]   And in the boonies is Chris Breen.
[00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:54.880]   And I'm here to it live.
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.780]   So we're all together again.
[00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.680]   So Chris, since you were there,
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.620]   let's start with your impressions of the event.
[00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.160]   I think by now, everybody knows that Apple announced
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.420]   a new nano.
[00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.260]   They updated the iPod touch.
[00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.360]   They updated iTunes.
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.760]   They said they were going to do iPhone 2.1.
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.800]   They did not announce anything earth shattering other than that.
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.000]   In fact, everything that they announced
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.600]   was stuff we'd already expected.
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.540]   Yeah, I mean, the rumor site's really got it this time.
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.300]   I think pretty much everything appeared
[00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.540]   that people had talked about.
[00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:27.680]   There was some speculation there
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.340]   might be a subscription service.
[00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.340]   But that was a little flaky to begin with.
[00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.540]   And it didn't happen.
[00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:33.740]   It didn't happen.
[00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.980]   But yeah, I mean, they were already pictures posted online.
[00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.940]   Glory, though, they were, which I think maybe
[00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.380]   lens of air are authenticity to them.
[00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.280]   Kevin Rose was the one I think who've
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.920]   got the first picture of the nano.
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.520]   And he got it dead right.
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.120]   It was the nano.
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.120]   Yeah.
[00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.620]   Somebody stuck a camera in somewhere.
[00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:50.960]   Maybe on an iPhone.
[00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.620]   He actually showed me the original document.
[00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:54.120]   Yeah.
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.120]   And it was an Apple document that somebody had leaked to him.
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.960]   Yeah.
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.560]   So if you followed any of that stuff,
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.260]   you saw what was coming out in Surenna.
[00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.200]   There it was.
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.500]   And we got the pricing on it.
[00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.000]   I think what we didn't expect was Steve Jobs to come out and say,
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.400]   I'm not dead.
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.400]   And then he couldn't--
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.240]   And that was sort of dead.
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.740]   He put the Mark Twain quote up that said
[00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:19.580]   that rumors of my death are greatly exaggerated.
[00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:20.480]   Yeah.
[00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:22.740]   And he spent about one minute on it.
[00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.440]   And they did as much as to prepare a slide.
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.240]   And then he said, and let's move on.
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.420]   And so that's really just a tough way of saying,
[00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:30.780]   I'm not going to talk about this anymore.
[00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:31.280]   We're done.
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.720]   How did he look?
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.220]   He looked like he looked at WWDC.
[00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.160]   So he's very thin.
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.120]   But he was energetic.
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.960]   And he got through the presentation.
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.660]   And he didn't look evil.
[00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:43.960]   He just looked really thin.
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.900]   Yeah.
[00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.360]   So there you have it.
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.000]   Thanks for joining us, everybody.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.100]   No.
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.540]   So across the pond, Bob, did you watch the video?
[00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.140]   How did you keep up with what was going on?
[00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:58.840]   I mean, I was checking--
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.480]   I mean, I was at work most of the day.
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.480]   And so I kept checking in when I got the chance.
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.080]   And I was checking Matt rumors.
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.420]   And I got a sort of update to that.
[00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.480]   And I did think--
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.980]   I always sort of hope that there'll
[00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.220]   be some groovy new thing that comes out that I'll go,
[00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:12.520]   whoop, I want one of those.
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.120]   And I have to be honest, there wasn't really.
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.360]   I mean, I use my iPhone now as an iPod.
[00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.060]   So I don't really have an interest in getting a new iPod.
[00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.560]   And there was nothing--
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.500]   In fact, I've just opened iTunes for the first time,
[00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:29.100]   the new one.
[00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:30.800]   I have downloaded that update.
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.200]   And I can't see the difference at the moment.
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.340]   I'm looking at it now.
[00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.240]   The biggest difference is this genius thing,
[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.540]   which we're going to talk about in a little bit.
[00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:39.740]   Yes, right.
[00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:41.480]   Because then I will have a quick look at that now.
[00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.080]   Because yes, I don't know whether it is yet.
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.980]   But then, oh, yes.
[00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:44.680]   Oh, I see.
[00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.980]   It's all different.
[00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:48.980]   Yes, you see, I've done my research, as you can tell.
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.380]   [laughter]
[00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:52.080]   Well, I launched it about an hour ago.
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.480]   It finally did-- yesterday you could go to apple.com
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.420]   and download it.
[00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:59.020]   And it finally did come across an Apple software update
[00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.020]   today.
[00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:02.420]   How about you?
[00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:04.820]   By the way, I was exactly the same thing as you, Robert.
[00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:05.460]   I was at work.
[00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:06.460]   I was in meetings.
[00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:08.460]   It was a little embarrassing because I had my Mac open.
[00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.400]   And I was on Gizmodo, which had an auto refreshing page.
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.400]   I got tired of pressing refresh, refresh.
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.680]   And so every once in a while, I kind of just casually
[00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:20.240]   glance over and look as if I didn't really care.
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.640]   And then I glanced back.
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.480]   I was very interested.
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.180]   I'm sure not much work gets done when
[00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:26.480]   they do one of these events.
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:27.280]   How about you, Don?
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:28.920]   How are you following the events?
[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.420]   Yeah, well, I did the typical sort of sitting
[00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:32.320]   in front of a browser.
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.520]   Well, four or five different browser windows all open,
[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.120]   checking things out.
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.660]   Maybe the Gizmodo and Engadget.
[00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:39.360]   And I must admit, they did a really good job.
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.360]   They pretty much kept in step with each other,
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.200]   although I think the color balance was off on--
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.500]   I think it was Engadget's coverage.
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:49.000]   So it looked as though Steve was wearing a brown turtle neck
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.940]   instead of a black turt.
[00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:55.040]   You know, I have to say, Gizmodo gets props for their coverage.
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:58.300]   Not only do they have an auto refreshing screen,
[00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:01.680]   but Brian Lamb was taking big, beautiful pictures.
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:05.180]   They had very, very good images coming back from it.
[00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:08.020]   Yeah, and also he sort of gave a commentary as well,
[00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:09.420]   which was quite humorous at times as well.
[00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:12.120]   So it was good fun to watch the Gizmodo and both.
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:13.120]   And a few other sites as well.
[00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:15.220]   But they were the two main ones with the auto refresh.
[00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:16.160]   Yeah.
[00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.360]   Did Engadget do auto refresh this time?
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:22.200]   Not sure, but at least now the things
[00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.600]   appeared at the top of the page, whereas I think
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:25.500]   they used to cover--
[00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:26.800]   Yeah, it would lower it all the way down.
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.000]   --it's scroll right the way down.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   It was ridiculous, yeah.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   But they've changed that now.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.940]   So the new events appeared at the top, which was much easier.
[00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:34.280]   And of course, over here in the UK,
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:35.880]   it was sort of tea time for us.
[00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:37.080]   It was 6 o'clock.
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:39.480]   So we had a working day to look forward to it.
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.080]   And then 6 o'clock comes along.
[00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:43.680]   And we down tools and watch it for half an hour.
[00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:44.580]   Well, it was about an hour.
[00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:45.680]   It wasn't in total.
[00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:48.180]   What was your reaction?
[00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:52.520]   Well, it was a good solid presentation.
[00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:53.720]   As you say, no surprises.
[00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:56.720]   A few minus surprises, but nothing really--
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:58.120]   the problem is, I think that we're getting--
[00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:59.960]   these rumors are getting so good now
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:01.860]   that it is taking some of the fun away from watching
[00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:05.360]   the events, because it really is just sort of rehash
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.760]   of what we've seen before.
[00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:08.960]   And it seems quite a while since Apple actually
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.500]   did something that surprised us.
[00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:12.600]   I think the last thing that really sort of blew us away
[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.800]   was when they released the iPhone, which came completely
[00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:16.060]   out of left field.
[00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:19.200]   But I can't think of an event since then where they've really
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:20.140]   pulled something out the bag.
[00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:21.800]   And it's mainly due to the accuracy
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.040]   of a lot of the rumor sites.
[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:25.740]   Which is surprising, because Apple does such a good job.
[00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:28.280]   Normally, of keeping these guys shut down,
[00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:30.680]   I wonder why all of a sudden they're
[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:33.680]   better able to get these secrets out.
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.680]   It always seems to be the iPod side of it, though.
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:38.580]   So I don't know if the iPod side is a little bit more
[00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:40.820]   flaky than the rest of the organization down there.
[00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:43.320]   And the document I saw was probably
[00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:44.920]   not leaked by an Apple employee.
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:46.420]   It was a document I could say now,
[00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:50.460]   I think, about cleaning dust out of the nano.
[00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:53.560]   And so I imagine that those kinds of training documents
[00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:55.160]   go out to a wide variety of people
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.660]   who aren't necessarily employed by Apple, which
[00:08:57.660 --> 00:08:59.960]   might be a weakness in all of this.
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:00.460]   Yeah.
[00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:02.160]   I noticed Steve picked up in it as well,
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.400]   because I think at the last-- when they launched the fat
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.840]   nano, you mentioned it might look familiar to you.
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:10.140]   And then yesterday, you also--
[00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:12.440]   suppliers are releasing things before we want them
[00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:13.640]   to or something along those lines.
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:14.940]   So it must be getting to them.
[00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:16.080]   I think it's probably quite irritated
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:17.740]   about how this stuff is getting out.
[00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:21.080]   Chris, this was kind of, though, a admission
[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:22.680]   that the fat nano wasn't a success.
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:26.920]   I mean, it's only been out for a year, and they're pulling it.
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:28.220]   Well, I'm not sure that that's--
[00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:29.720]   I mean, I didn't walk away with that feeling.
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:31.860]   I think every September, they have
[00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:34.720]   to come out with a new nano or some kind of new iPod,
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:35.820]   because the holidays are coming.
[00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:37.060]   And they can't very well just say, oh,
[00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:38.560]   we'll look at it as new colors.
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:41.060]   That's not enough to get people to kind of rush out
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:44.560]   and buy their fourth, fifth, and 17 iPod.
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:46.660]   In this case, they tarted up the color scheme.
[00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:49.060]   And really, in person, these things are gorgeous.
[00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:51.500]   These really are the prettiest nano I've seen so far.
[00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:53.000]   There's like eight colors, right?
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:53.500]   There's a lot.
[00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:56.300]   They're nine colors, if you consider silver and black
[00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:57.540]   to be colors.
[00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:59.440]   But Apple will take paints to tell you
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:01.940]   that pink is not in the rainbow.
[00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:04.040]   So this is not a rainbow assortment.
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:05.880]   It practically is, and they arranged it red orange,
[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:08.280]   green, yellow, blue, and to go violet.
[00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:09.280]   Except for pink.
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:10.280]   They threw the pink in there.
[00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:11.780]   So it's actually in the proper order.
[00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:13.580]   Well, you don't paint a pink in the rainbow.
[00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:16.880]   And black and silver were at the end.
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.420]   There's a product red version, which
[00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:21.920]   is Bono's project for AIDS relief.
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:23.720]   And so that's nice that they did that.
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:25.520]   No white, though.
[00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:26.320]   No.
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.420]   No.
[00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:29.460]   Because they really--
[00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:31.360]   they talk about these as being very vibrant.
[00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:34.060]   And even the black one, as much as you
[00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:37.200]   can make black vibrant, they did, white--
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:39.800]   I don't know how they could more vibrant up
[00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:41.160]   a white iPod.
[00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:42.960]   And so I think they probably did a few caps of it.
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:44.360]   And just that's not going to work.
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:45.960]   Yeah, I mean, I'm looking on the Apple page.
[00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:48.800]   The purple is very-- it's aggressively purple.
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:49.440]   Yeah.
[00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:51.240]   And they all-- and they did the same thing with the shuffles.
[00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:54.140]   They had some extra ink left over and they dipped those.
[00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:56.840]   And they really just leap out at you.
[00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:58.940]   And they're really very, very pretty.
[00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:01.720]   So the horizontal thing is nice that you
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:03.680]   can watch Lawrence Morabian in wide screening
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:05.180]   without your head exploding.
[00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:07.220]   But it's really a lot of it.
[00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:09.160]   It's just going to be people are going to see these on the shop
[00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.020]   and go, oh my god, I've got to get one of these
[00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:12.020]   and throw it in the stocking.
[00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:13.120]   It's pretty.
[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:13.720]   It's pretty.
[00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:16.860]   Now we were worried when we talked before about the curvature
[00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:18.960]   and glare, because the pictures showed a lot of glare
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:19.660]   on the screen.
[00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:21.100]   Have you actually held these and looked at them?
[00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:22.800]   Yeah, yeah, I have.
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:24.900]   We got a couple of them into the backhold of the officer
[00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:26.300]   yesterday.
[00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:28.740]   Yeah, it's very watchable.
[00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:30.040]   They're tough to photograph.
[00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:32.040]   And that's why you're seeing so many of these things.
[00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:34.740]   We went into the demo area with our cameras.
[00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:36.380]   And we're trying to take a decent shot of them.
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:39.840]   But it's tough because the screen is curved a little bit.
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:41.780]   But when you're actually watching it, it's fine.
[00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:47.080]   And the screen size, is it essentially the same size
[00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:48.680]   as the classic?
[00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:49.520]   No, it's not.
[00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:53.460]   It's actually the same size as the Fat Nano.
[00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:55.120]   It's not any bigger?
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:56.660]   No, and that's the surprising thing.
[00:11:56.660 --> 00:12:00.060]   When you see it on screen during the presentation,
[00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:01.960]   it seems like, oh, this has got to be bigger.
[00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:04.900]   You know, it's a larger piece of beef jerky than in the past.
[00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:05.900]   But you see it in person.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.400]   No, it's exactly the same size as the old Nano.
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:10.100]   So it's basically that Nano.
[00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:11.600]   You turn it on that side and that's the screen.
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:15.040]   So that's ridiculous.
[00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:18.940]   It's like putting fins on the car.
[00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:20.040]   That's extremely--
[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:22.340]   Oh, and in nine separate colors.
[00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:23.640]   Go ahead, Don.
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:26.480]   Yes, Steve was on a CNN interview after the keynote.
[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:30.280]   And he actually did come forth with the information
[00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:32.720]   that the Fat Nano hadn't been received that well.
[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:34.680]   And everybody seemed to prefer the long slender
[00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:36.240]   and the slat-- and I was thinking.
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:38.840]   So the only way they could do it was to actually rotate the screen.
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:40.540]   So it is the same screen as the Fat Nano,
[00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:44.780]   but just people seem to enjoy the sort of long slender form
[00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:46.380]   rather than the fat chunky form.
[00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:48.180]   I remember when I saw the first pictures,
[00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:51.420]   we thought the Fat Nano leaks were phony
[00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:53.720]   because it was so damn ugly.
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:56.800]   We thought they can't possibly be releasing something like this.
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:58.160]   Boy, we were wrong.
[00:12:58.160 --> 00:12:59.160]   What do you think, Bob?
[00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:01.160]   What do you think of the new Nano look?
[00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:02.360]   I mean, it is interesting.
[00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:04.060]   My son has the Fat Nano.
[00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:07.220]   And he's now inherited my old--
[00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:09.820]   my original iPod, which has got much more storage.
[00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:11.460]   And he's given me his Fat Nano.
[00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:13.060]   And I think it's really good.
[00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:14.260]   I like it.
[00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:15.760]   I mean, because it's so tiny in that.
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:17.060]   I mean, I go running with it.
[00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:18.460]   Not very often, I'd like to say.
[00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:20.060]   Not very far, but I do.
[00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:22.760]   And it's-- you don't even know you've got it with you
[00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:24.660]   because it's so minutely light.
[00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:26.660]   I just tuck it in my shirt, pop it, jog off.
[00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:28.660]   Well, I imagine this will be very similar feeling,
[00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:31.860]   but of course now you have to buy all new accessories
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:34.860]   because it's got to fit in any of those cases that you run with.
[00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:35.760]   No, exactly.
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:37.760]   No, that is-- I mean, it does-- there
[00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:40.560]   is an element of the new model car,
[00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:43.460]   with slightly bigger fins to it.
[00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:47.160]   Because I think the iPhone just knocked me out when I first
[00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:47.660]   saw that.
[00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:49.560]   And I didn't buy one for a year and a half
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:51.060]   and waited for the 3G to come out.
[00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:52.160]   And it is so good.
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:54.760]   It is such an extraordinary step technologically
[00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:57.060]   in every way that it operates and how it works.
[00:13:57.060 --> 00:13:59.760]   And the screen, for me, a man my age,
[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:01.260]   it's big enough to watch something on.
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:04.560]   Whereas the screen on this one would be--
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:05.360]   I couldn't cope.
[00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:06.560]   It's like watching a stamp.
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:10.660]   Don, you and Robert couldn't legally buy an iPhone
[00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:11.960]   until this year.
[00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:14.760]   Did you have the first generation?
[00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:16.260]   Yeah, I picked one up when I came over
[00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:17.760]   to do one of the new video expos.
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:20.560]   So I had the first generation phone.
[00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:21.260]   Yeah.
[00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.160]   I have to say this-- it is more than fins.
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:27.060]   I have to give Apple a little more credit than that, Chris,
[00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:30.960]   because there are some software features that are great.
[00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:32.760]   OK, I want to ask all of you one by one.
[00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:35.960]   What do you think of the shake to shuffle idea?
[00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:37.160]   Robert, what do you think of that?
[00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:38.260]   Do you like to shake the--
[00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:39.960]   I'm intrigued by that.
[00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:41.260]   I mean, I might really like that,
[00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.760]   but I'm intrigued that if you're running with it--
[00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:45.860]   It might be shaking.
[00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:49.260]   Yeah, you might suddenly find your 15 songs in three steps.
[00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:52.360]   I mean, presumably you need to shake it quite violently.
[00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:53.860]   I mean, it's just--
[00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:55.360]   I'm not going to know until I have a go with one,
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:58.860]   but if you're running along and strapped to your arm,
[00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:00.860]   you're just hearing the beginning bit of--
[00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:01.960]   Right.
[00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:04.460]   Procal harem, and then you're suddenly under the Beatles.
[00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:07.460]   A wider shade of-- you can weaken, we're good.
[00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:10.360]   So what do you think, Don?
[00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:11.460]   The shake.
[00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:12.460]   You like that?
[00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:14.260]   Yeah, it doesn't do a lot for me, to be honest,
[00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.360]   but I think that's-- I think there are other phones
[00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:17.360]   that have a similar thing.
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:19.060]   I think my daughter has-- Oh, really?
[00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:21.660]   Yeah, yeah, she has a Sony Ericsson phone
[00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:25.160]   that has a shake to shuffle.
[00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:27.460]   I think it's a shake to move on to the next track,
[00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:28.660]   rather than just a shuffle.
[00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:30.160]   Oh, yeah, that sounds familiar.
[00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:31.260]   Yeah.
[00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.160]   Yeah, so that's something-- they've got the accelerometer in there.
[00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:35.760]   They might as well use it for a few gimmicky things as well.
[00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:37.760]   What-- Chris, have you played with a shake to shuffle?
[00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:39.160]   What is-- how does that work?
[00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:40.160]   Are you shaking?
[00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:41.360]   You have to be careful how you shake?
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:42.160]   No, you don't.
[00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:44.260]   Actually, you have to shake it really big, or--
[00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:45.060]   Oh, you do?
[00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:46.960]   Yeah, I talked to an apple rip there,
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:49.160]   because I was shaking it sort of normally,
[00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:51.160]   and you really have to sort of shake it in anger.
[00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:52.460]   Like, I hate this song.
[00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:53.560]   Don't play it.
[00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:56.660]   And then, you know, then it goes on, and it lets you know--
[00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:58.960]   because I had that-- you know, what about you
[00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:01.260]   when you're running exactly that idea?
[00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:02.560]   You said, no, no, we tested it with that,
[00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:04.260]   and it won't do it when you're running.
[00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:05.660]   And so, well, what about a trampoline?
[00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:07.260]   And he said, well, we didn't do the trampoline.
[00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:08.460]   [laughter]
[00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:11.260]   And, you know, I thought, well, okay.
[00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:13.160]   Well, you guys haven't really tested it, have you?
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:14.860]   What kind of shoddy organization is?
[00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:16.160]   You don't do trampoline.
[00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:19.560]   Yeah, he wasn't going to commit to the trampoline.
[00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:22.060]   But he tried the mechanical bull, huh?
[00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:23.260]   Oh, no talk of that.
[00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:25.260]   But he was dead sure about jogging.
[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:29.960]   And really, I did try sort of modestly shaking the thing,
[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:30.960]   and it didn't go.
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:32.660]   So you really have to give it a good snap,
[00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:34.360]   and then it will move along.
[00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:38.160]   I think, you know, to me, I just think it's cool.
[00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:40.660]   It's a silly little thing.
[00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:44.760]   But I just think that that's the kind of thing consumers grab onto.
[00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:48.660]   It's, you know, we as tech people maybe are less impressed.
[00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:51.660]   But a consumer looks at the color and shakes the shuffle,
[00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:53.360]   and they go, oh, they go buy that.
[00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:56.060]   I mean, that's the kind of thing that sells nanos, right?
[00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:58.060]   And it's going to look great in the commercial, too.
[00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:01.460]   Mechanical bull, I'm telling you.
[00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:04.060]   How about the rest of the software?
[00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:05.660]   They've changed cover flow.
[00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:06.660]   Whoa.
[00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:08.460]   Are you shaking your microphone?
[00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:11.060]   They changed cover flow.
[00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:12.460]   They changed.
[00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:14.660]   They've got a musical genius built in.
[00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:16.860]   Now, this is the genius as part of the new iTunes too.
[00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:20.660]   So maybe we should talk about that in both contexts.
[00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:24.960]   The idea of the genius, by the way, can we give apples and props
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:27.260]   for just making genius be their word?
[00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:30.460]   You know, they got the genius bar at the Apple Store.
[00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:32.560]   And now they got this genius built in the iTunes.
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:33.860]   I see a trend here.
[00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:35.660]   And I think this is probably a good thing for Apple.
[00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:37.560]   Yeah, no, they've patented it.
[00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:38.360]   So it's.
[00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:41.360]   They own the word genius is theirs.
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:44.060]   Yeah, you have to have an IQ over 240.
[00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:44.660]   That's where the way.
[00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:45.760]   Sorry, Stephen Hawking.
[00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:46.760]   Sorry, Einstein.
[00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:48.660]   No, you can't use it.
[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:50.860]   Well, yeah, I'm going to put a TM next to you.
[00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:51.360]   Right.
[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:54.460]   You can say Stephen Hawking pretty smart guy, but not genius.
[00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:57.160]   So what is what is a genius dude?
[00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:58.160]   Chris, how does that work?
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:02.360]   Well, the idea of genius is and you first have to initiate it
[00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:06.460]   on the in iTunes and it's it's for those situations where you've
[00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:07.460]   got a track in there.
[00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:10.160]   Let's say you're listening to an Elvis Costello track and say,
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:13.060]   I really like this and I want to listen to something kind of like
[00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:18.460]   in this genre or vein and you send up your library to the
[00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:24.460]   cloud when we get another cloud thing where it's analyzed and Apple
[00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:27.960]   check to the other people listening to for certain tracks.
[00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:30.260]   So I choose my Elvis Costello track.
[00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:32.260]   I say hit the genius button.
[00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:35.160]   Give me something else and it may give me Dave Edmonds,
[00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:38.460]   Nick Lowe, Ian Drury, Carly Carter because they were married.
[00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:42.160]   Oh, so it's not just so Pandora would be kind of because it's
[00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:45.060]   the same type of song, but this is more than just the same type of
[00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:45.660]   song.
[00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:48.360]   Yeah, it's it's for sale.
[00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:50.260]   I did it with an Elvis Costello track and it did.
[00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:52.760]   You gave you rock pile and Nick Lowe and that's
[00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:53.260]   that's true.
[00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:56.460]   There's some associations here, but it's about what other people
[00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:59.760]   are listening to and the more people that do this, the more
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:00.960]   related you're going to get.
[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:01.660]   So that's interesting.
[00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:02.660]   It's more it's not compute,
[00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:04.060]   purely a computer algorithm.
[00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:07.260]   It's also based on what other people are listening to.
[00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:07.960]   Yeah.
[00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:10.760]   And for instance, right now it doesn't know Al Green on my it
[00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:11.360]   doesn't it.
[00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:13.060]   I mean, I'm
[00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:14.860]   not countably it doesn't know Al Green.
[00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:18.560]   However, I presume that eventually enough people who do know
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:21.460]   Al Green are going to use this and it will start to know what
[00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:22.360]   what's related.
[00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:26.260]   Yeah, for example, I had the Ethiopian singer Gigi on my
[00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:29.660]   on my library and it has no idea who she is.
[00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:30.260]   Right.
[00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:35.160]   All right, I'm looking at Alison Krauss recommends Josh Turner,
[00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:37.660]   Nicole Creek, Vince Gill, Randy Trout, has a little country.
[00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:38.260]   John Denver.
[00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:38.760]   Thank God.
[00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:39.560]   I'm a country boy.
[00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:40.660]   I don't think so.
[00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:42.360]   I don't.
[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:43.760]   Well, there's no taste filter built in.
[00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:45.560]   Dolly Parton Jolene.
[00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:47.060]   Yeah, sure.
[00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:48.360]   Little broad.
[00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:49.860]   Very broad.
[00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:51.960]   But they make money on this, don't they?
[00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:53.760]   Because I noticed right next to it by and I mean, he's a
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:54.960]   sense by 99 cents.
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:56.160]   This is a way to sell music.
[00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:59.860]   Yeah, and it's an important thing because you know, now that
[00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:04.260]   rating is not pushing recommendations to us, really.
[00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:06.760]   And everybody's plugged into iPods and headphones.
[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:08.460]   So you're not talking to anybody about music.
[00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:10.560]   Where do you start getting recommendations?
[00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:14.160]   Amazon is already doing this and another outfit like it.
[00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:18.560]   So it's a nice idea to figure out how to discover new music.
[00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:22.260]   For example, I downloaded the South by Southwest recording
[00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:24.260]   every year, which are like 700.
[00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:25.060]   They're torrents.
[00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:25.560]   Yeah.
[00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:26.760]   Yeah, huge amount.
[00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:29.360]   And I haven't taken the time to go through all of them.
[00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:32.160]   And iTunes is smart enough to actually recognize some of those
[00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:32.560]   artists.
[00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:35.860]   So I've been able to put together Genius Playlist and discover
[00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:38.160]   new artists out of this massive music I haven't listened to.
[00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:40.160]   So I'm seeing here.
[00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:41.660]   I see the Genius sidebar.
[00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:44.160]   I see it makes it says what does a couple of interesting things
[00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:46.260]   and says songs you're missing, which I kind of like.
[00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:47.460]   Wait a minute.
[00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:49.360]   It can't find matches for the Beatles.
[00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:51.160]   That's a little bit of a battle.
[00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:52.060]   The store yet.
[00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:54.860]   I think it's only stuff that they've already got in the store
[00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:55.860]   that they can actually match against.
[00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:58.060]   I think some of the problems that you're having with it,
[00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:00.760]   sort of not identifying stuff is due to the metadata.
[00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:02.560]   So if you don't buy it from the store, if it's something
[00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:05.060]   that you've ripped or got from other sources and you either
[00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:07.760]   put your own metadata in or its metadata from.
[00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:11.260]   Is it grace knows if that doesn't match exactly what
[00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:13.160]   expecting they can't do a match on it.
[00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:14.360]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:15.360]   Yeah, I've seen it.
[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:16.560]   It's really strange actually.
[00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:18.960]   I mean, I like the Genius facility, but I've seen a couple of
[00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:22.360]   tweets today from people who have only seen one half of it
[00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:24.960]   because people I think are seeing the Genius sidebar,
[00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:27.660]   you know, which is where they're actually sort of identifying
[00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:29.560]   tracks that you haven't got or albums that you haven't got.
[00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:30.560]   So you can go and buy them.
[00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:34.260]   But people are tending to miss the Genius playlist over in the
[00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:37.360]   left hand sidebar and the little Genius button at the bottom.
[00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:39.460]   And I think some people I think they need to do just just do a
[00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:42.260]   little bit of education to so people realize that it's not just
[00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:43.960]   to sell your music, you stretch a user own.
[00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:45.160]   Well, help me because I'm looking.
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:46.360]   I don't see a Genius button.
[00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:47.360]   Where would I see that?
[00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:49.160]   That bottom right hand corner.
[00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:52.260]   If you highlight a track and then there should be a little
[00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:55.060]   Genius button down on the bottom toolbar.
[00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:57.960]   Oh, that little nuclear, the little molecule there.
[00:21:57.960 --> 00:21:58.460]   All right.
[00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:01.460]   So if you press that, oh, it made a play list of all of the
[00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:04.460]   stuff and that stuff that you already got within your iTunes
[00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:04.960]   library.
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:06.360]   Oh, that's a pretty good.
[00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:07.460]   Oh, that's good.
[00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:10.660]   Well, the number of times, I mean, I've created my own playlists
[00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:11.660]   and it's easy to do.
[00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:14.260]   But there are times when you just don't feel like making a
[00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:16.860]   playlist because you already haven't got one for the, you know,
[00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:17.660]   for the mood you're in.
[00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:19.460]   And I find that a real boon.
[00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:22.160]   It's a fantastic way just to listen to, you know, a whole load of
[00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:25.160]   music that you've forgotten about or, you know, it'll just go
[00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:28.260]   away and pull together a playlist of things that suit your mood
[00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:28.860]   at the time.
[00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:31.060]   It's a pretty broad.
[00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:32.060]   Where's again?
[00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:34.460]   This is early days and I presumably gets more refined as more
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:38.960]   people use it, but I clicked on a yes song and it put Crosby
[00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:41.960]   stills a Nash, Neil Young rolling stones, Derek in the
[00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:45.460]   Domino's Roxy music, talking heads, Steely Dan, and kind of did
[00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:47.560]   a classic rock thing with this Joni Mitchell in there.
[00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:48.360]   There's Rush.
[00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:52.360]   It's an interesting choice and yet, of course, these are all my
[00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:52.960]   songs.
[00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:53.760]   I like it.
[00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:55.360]   I mean, it's a good looking playlist.
[00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:57.960]   I would listen to this and it's varied, which is nice.
[00:22:57.960 --> 00:22:58.760]   Yeah.
[00:22:58.760 --> 00:22:59.060]   Yeah.
[00:22:59.060 --> 00:22:59.760]   Will it does it?
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:03.160]   I got the impression from the way Steve talked that it might
[00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:05.760]   also know more than just genres.
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:08.360]   It might know beats and feelings.
[00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:10.160]   Is that the case or no?
[00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:12.860]   Well, I think it looks at various things.
[00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:15.060]   I think it also looks at number of times you've played it
[00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:18.760]   and if you have played it for a while and it must be quite a
[00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:20.760]   complex algorithm that puts together to do it.
[00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:22.860]   Did Apple tell you anything, Chris, about it?
[00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:24.260]   No, they didn't.
[00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:26.960]   They just, you know, they put up the graphic thing.
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:30.460]   We've got 18 million people feeding this thing and therefore
[00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:33.060]   as they do, this gets much more intelligent.
[00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:34.860]   They didn't explain in what way.
[00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:36.660]   How it becomes smarter.
[00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:39.460]   So Bobby, Bobby, you've had five minutes to play with it.
[00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:40.060]   What do you think?
[00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:40.460]   Yeah.
[00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:42.360]   No, I'm, yeah.
[00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:45.360]   I'm so embarrassed.
[00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:47.260]   I hadn't done this before, but this is really good.
[00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:48.060]   I really love this.
[00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:50.360]   I mean, because the frustrating thing for me is I'm on my
[00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:54.160]   laptop here, which is not my main computer with all my
[00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:54.560]   songs on.
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:56.960]   So I've got a pathetic, pathetic, I'm a hand of songs
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:57.260]   on it.
[00:23:57.260 --> 00:24:00.660]   Got quite a few audio books, but it really is fun.
[00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:03.060]   I think this is, but after all, I poo pooed about the
[00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:04.560]   new iPods.
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:05.560]   This is stunning.
[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:06.860]   I didn't know this was even happening.
[00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:07.560]   This is just brilliant.
[00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:09.660]   And I mean, I'm wondering whether it does do it with things
[00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:10.360]   like audio books.
[00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:11.260]   I mean, I'm wondering if it does it.
[00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:13.160]   Unfortunately, I'm trying to try it immediately.
[00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:13.460]   Yeah.
[00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:14.760]   Wouldn't that be nice?
[00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:17.560]   Wouldn't that be cool if it would suggest different audio
[00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:17.860]   books?
[00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:20.460]   You know, in that, I mean, it may be a will do eventually,
[00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:23.160]   but I mean, this is really good though, because that's the
[00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:24.060]   thing I never do.
[00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:27.460]   You know, I meet young people who have playlists and show
[00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:27.960]   them to me.
[00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:28.960]   I go, that's very clever.
[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:30.860]   I had to be like, but to actually be able to click one
[00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:32.560]   button and it's, I can't.
[00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:36.160]   You know, I've got the mental capacity to put a playlist
[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:36.560]   together.
[00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:39.960]   But if it does it for me, then I'm going to start listening to
[00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:42.760]   music I haven't heard for years because I've got thousands
[00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:46.560]   of songs on my iTunes, on my main computer, which I don't
[00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:47.060]   hear.
[00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:48.060]   You know, I don't listen to them.
[00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:49.660]   Well, I'm exactly my reaction.
[00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:50.960]   I'm putting it on my main.
[00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:52.360]   It's right on now on my main computer.
[00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:54.660]   And that is it's kind of fun to dredge this stuff.
[00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:57.660]   I'm glad you mentioned audio books because it's time to
[00:24:57.660 --> 00:24:58.460]   take a little break.
[00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:00.560]   We'll come back with more of our analysis.
[00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:01.760]   You know what's coming Bob.
[00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:06.260]   I can tell it's time to talk about audible audible.com/macbreak.
[00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:09.760]   That's the website to go to to get your free audio book from
[00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:10.260]   Audible.
[00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:13.760]   And yeah, when I go to my my audio books selection here, I've
[00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:17.960]   got a hundred books in my, which I don't know, 15 days it
[00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:19.760]   says I'm going to be listening to these books.
[00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:22.960]   But I just it's a it's a it's a security thing for me to know
[00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:25.160]   that I've got several books, different books to listen to.
[00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:27.560]   I just downloaded Never Wear from Neil Gaiman.
[00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:29.960]   I think it was you Bob who tell recommended I can't remember
[00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:30.860]   who recommended that to me.
[00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:32.660]   But I've really been enjoying that.
[00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:35.660]   It is audible is a wonderful resource.
[00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:40.860]   If you want to listen to great literature to trashy fiction
[00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:44.060]   to nonfiction to history, whatever you're reading tastes
[00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:45.560]   or all of the above.
[00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:46.260]   That's my case.
[00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:51.560]   I just I very I might mix it up audible.com/macbreak.

[00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:18.160]   We thank him so much for the support of Macbreak Weekly.
[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:21.160]   So the new time I think they in the touch changes were
[00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:22.160]   were pretty significant.
[00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:24.560]   They made me sad because I of course, you know, I bought
[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:26.360]   an iPod classic.
[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:30.060]   I bought the now discontinued two weeks ago for Abby
[00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:30.860]   because she was going to France.
[00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:32.960]   I bought the discontinued 80 gigabyte.
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:34.760]   I think it was 80 gigabyte iPod classic.
[00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:36.260]   They replaced that with a 120.
[00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:38.160]   Eliminated the 160.
[00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:40.560]   Why do you think they did that?
[00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:42.260]   Christy, any thoughts?
[00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:44.760]   Did they did people not buy the 160?
[00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:47.960]   Well, that's what Apple claims is that they prefer the thinner
[00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:53.860]   one and is it size or is it disc size with or disc size?
[00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:58.760]   Well, with they said people just like the thinner iPod
[00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:01.960]   classic and so they you know about I think the only reason
[00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:03.760]   to buy the classic is for capacity.
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:04.460]   So why not?
[00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:05.560]   Because one you can't.
[00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:06.160]   Right.
[00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:08.760]   But apparently it turned out not to be the case.
[00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:10.160]   The people were running for the slimmer one.
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:12.160]   So they could still have a very large music library,
[00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:14.160]   but they didn't need to carry everything with it.
[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:16.160]   I think nobody really wants 160 gigs.
[00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:17.760]   Also, you have to if you're going to do that,
[00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:20.260]   reserve 160 gigs of your computer's hard drive.
[00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:20.760]   Yeah.
[00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:22.360]   And that's not insignificant.
[00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:26.560]   No, so for very, very serious audio files.
[00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:29.660]   Yes, they want the huge iPod, but they're not enough for those
[00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:30.260]   people out there.
[00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:32.460]   I think the just the last so they they put the difference,
[00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:35.860]   put it 120 and that's the biggest one out now.
[00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:37.460]   Yeah, 120.
[00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:38.760]   I mean, it's on its way out.
[00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:40.860]   You know, as soon as they can get flash capacity,
[00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:43.060]   we'll see the end of the hard drive iPod.
[00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:44.160]   I was a little disappointed.
[00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:48.260]   I thought the touch would go higher sizes considerably higher
[00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:48.660]   sizes.
[00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:53.260]   I was I was kind of sad to see the 16 and the 32 and nothing
[00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:53.760]   bigger.
[00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:56.260]   Yeah, I mean, you know, flash comes down.
[00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:57.160]   It'll be there.
[00:27:57.160 --> 00:28:00.260]   Yeah, but I do think that the changes they made were much
[00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:00.560]   needed.
[00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:01.860]   The addition of speakers.
[00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:03.860]   I know people mock that.
[00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:06.060]   I think that's one of the best things about the iPhone is I
[00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:08.460]   can listen to podcasts without plugging in headphones.
[00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:12.360]   I think the addition of a volume control, a physical
[00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:13.960]   volume control, very important.
[00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:17.460]   Still still know still know kind of.
[00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:20.260]   Click wheel analog though, huh?
[00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:22.860]   You can't right, but I've actually heard the speaker.
[00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:24.760]   So they're not very good.
[00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:26.060]   It's terrible.
[00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:28.160]   Worse than the iPhone.
[00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:29.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:31.460]   Oh, that's too bad because the iPhone they improved the
[00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:31.960]   speakers.
[00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:35.460]   Yeah, they did know that because if you listen to the thing,
[00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:37.860]   you know, you know, the iPhone speakers down there, the
[00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:40.260]   left bottom corner, you put your thumb over and you can't
[00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:40.860]   hear it.
[00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:41.260]   Right.
[00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:45.060]   The speaker on the iPod touch is just in there somewhere
[00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:46.260]   and it comes out of every.
[00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:53.560]   And it's very bright, really tinny lo-fi and even watching
[00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:55.860]   you move because I thought, well, great, I can pass my
[00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:58.660]   iPod touch back to my daughter in the back seat of a car
[00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:01.360]   and she's going to watch movie not going to happen because
[00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:03.860]   along with car noise and the brightness of the speaker,
[00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:06.360]   you're just not going to get me fidelity out of it.
[00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:08.960]   So it's great for alerts, alarms, that kind of thing or to
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:09.960]   preview a song.
[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:11.060]   Do I really want to hear this?
[00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:11.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:12.460]   Let me plug my headphones in.
[00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:13.460]   How about gaming?
[00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:15.260]   I think that was one of the things that they were pushing.
[00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:18.660]   Yeah, I think for gaming, it's going to be okay, but you
[00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:21.960]   know, games have very sophisticated audio now and it
[00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:23.060]   just isn't stereo.
[00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:25.060]   So you're not going to get any kind of effect like that.
[00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:29.260]   It's fine for some gaming, but if you want the big sound,
[00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:29.960]   you're going to want to hit.
[00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:33.460]   Robert, is the touch too expensive still?
[00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:35.960]   I mean, it's not a cheap thing, is it?
[00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:38.560]   I mean, when I heard it, but that's very interesting to hear
[00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:40.560]   about the speaker because when I heard that, and I had
[00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:42.660]   the speaker in, I thought, oh, that's good because I exactly
[00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:43.160]   the same.
[00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:45.860]   I do occasionally chuck my phone down in the kitchen when
[00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:48.560]   I'm cooking and I don't plug it into anything and I can hear
[00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:48.960]   it quite.
[00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:50.960]   It's like a little it's like a a.m. radio.
[00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:51.560]   It's not a great.
[00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:54.860]   It reminds me of my childhood and one of those little tiny
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:56.260]   radios, but you can hear it.
[00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:59.760]   Whereas it sounds like this isn't quite up to that to that
[00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:00.060]   level.
[00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:03.660]   So I mean, it is I find that very confusing.
[00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:07.360]   My daughter has an old the original touch, which she loves
[00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:10.260]   and you know, but she always listens to if she ever listens
[00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:10.860]   to anything on it.
[00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:12.860]   She listened to it on headphones and that's right.
[00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:15.760]   That's now the new headphones do have that clicker.
[00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:16.660]   So you can.
[00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:18.160]   Chris, that's good.
[00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:20.760]   Yeah, Chris, is that the same as the iPhone clicker or does
[00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:21.860]   it have more functionality?
[00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:23.960]   It's different and these are not included.
[00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:26.660]   These are this is an add on accessory.
[00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:30.360]   You get the standard Apple headphones when you purchase one
[00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:30.960]   of these things.
[00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:36.760]   But for those who have an old iPhone headset, it does work
[00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:38.560]   with the iPod touch, the new one.
[00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:40.560]   So you can pause and play with it.
[00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:45.060]   The mic as far as I know doesn't seem to do anything, but
[00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:49.360]   the accessory, the $29 headphones will give you volume
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:50.160]   control as well.
[00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:54.660]   So you get a remote on the wire as well as volume.
[00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:59.460]   That's a good that's that's actually probably be worth buying.
[00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:02.460]   I mean, I I use that on the iPhone all the time to pause.
[00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:03.860]   And then you double click.
[00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:06.160]   It goes to the next song that is really handy and I would
[00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:08.160]   love to have the volume control on that as well.
[00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:10.260]   I think that's a is it a there's a little slider on it.
[00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:10.860]   How does that work?
[00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:13.760]   It's very much like what we have on the iPhone.
[00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:18.260]   So it's that little hunk of plastic iPhone.
[00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:19.560]   You can't change volume on that.
[00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:20.160]   Right.
[00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:21.160]   So it's a little longer.
[00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:24.460]   So you press one end to go up and then the other end to go down.
[00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:25.160]   It's a rocker.
[00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:25.860]   Yeah, it's a rocker.
[00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:26.760]   I got it.
[00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:29.760]   And there is a rocker now on the iPod touch on the side.
[00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:30.760]   Yeah.
[00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:35.260]   And that's it's a little less robust looking than the one on the iPhone,
[00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:36.660]   but it works exactly the same.
[00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:36.960]   Right.
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:37.860]   Right.
[00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:39.660]   Anything else on the touch?
[00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:42.560]   Soft as a software much changed.
[00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:43.360]   It has a genius.
[00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:46.360]   How does a genius work on the new Nano on the touch?
[00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:51.860]   The touch is it's actually a playlist entry.
[00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:56.160]   So when you go to play list and you hit me as a go to playlist and then touch genius,
[00:31:56.160 --> 00:32:00.060]   it will expose all the songs that you have on your iPod,
[00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:05.860]   which point you tap one of those and then it creates that 25 song genius list for you.
[00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:07.860]   If you want, you can press reset.
[00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:09.160]   You know that wasn't close enough.
[00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:10.360]   It will try again.
[00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:14.260]   Of course, if it only confined about 25 songs that work, it'll just keep spitting out.
[00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:14.460]   Right.
[00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:14.760]   Right.
[00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:18.760]   From there, you can press new and then it will give you a whole new,
[00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:21.260]   you know, it'll show you the song list again that you can choose.
[00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:25.660]   Or if you're on a now playing screen, there's the little genius icon there.
[00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:29.360]   You've tapped that and it will create a genius list based on.
[00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:32.360]   I hear you typing Robert.
[00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:34.260]   Oh, gosh.
[00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:35.460]   Isn't that good?
[00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:38.160]   Okay.
[00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:38.760]   I'm sorry.
[00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:40.860]   You can't do anything when you're on the show.
[00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:44.660]   No, you have to just sit in front of the screen and look and just look.
[00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:46.060]   You may not do anything else.
[00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:47.660]   No mousing, no touching.
[00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:51.160]   No, no, but I'm just all I'm doing is writing notes to make myself remember things
[00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:52.460]   to try and sound intelligent.
[00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:53.760]   Well, here's your chance.
[00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:54.760]   Oh, my goodness.
[00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:56.860]   Now, you said you run occasionally.
[00:32:56.860 --> 00:32:58.560]   It has the new Nike plus in there.
[00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:02.360]   Yes, I've never, I've never used one of those and that's when you get the shoes
[00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:03.060]   and you run and you run.
[00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:03.960]   Yeah, do you need Chris?
[00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:04.760]   You need to put you.
[00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:06.260]   You don't need to buy anything more now.
[00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:06.960]   It's built in.
[00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:07.660]   Right.
[00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:09.560]   Yeah, you don't need to dongle anymore for the iPod.
[00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:12.460]   So you just have the shoes and it talks to the iPod and not.
[00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:15.960]   So it's the accelerometer is watching you bounce.
[00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:17.360]   Is that how it's working?
[00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:21.160]   Well, yeah, I suppose or they've got it to work through Wi-Fi or something.
[00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:22.660]   I never used that in the Nike.
[00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:25.460]   Yeah, I think there's a special receiver that they've built into the new touch.
[00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:28.960]   But I would have thought the form factor might be a little bit large for runners,
[00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:30.960]   although it is very light and thin.
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:34.060]   You know, it's quite a smaller than it looks for summer.
[00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:34.460]   Is it?
[00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:34.860]   Yeah.
[00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:35.460]   Is it Chris?
[00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:36.460]   Is it smaller than it looks?
[00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:36.860]   I mean, it.
[00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:41.360]   It's a the tiniest bit thinner than the previous touch.
[00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:41.960]   Okay.
[00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:44.760]   And but so now I'm confused.
[00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:46.160]   Do you have to buy the Nike shoes?
[00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:47.960]   Do you have to have some other part of it?
[00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:51.360]   Yeah, you have to buy the shoes or you have to buy a transmitter that's called.
[00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:52.960]   Oh, you still have to buy the little thing.
[00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:55.660]   Yeah, but not the dongle thing.
[00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:59.160]   So now you don't let at least you don't have to have a little receiver on the end of the.
[00:33:59.160 --> 00:33:59.760]   I get it.
[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:00.560]   I get it.
[00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:05.260]   So you still need the thing you insert into the shoe and you still have to have a desire to run,
[00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:06.060]   which is the hardest.
[00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:11.060]   I don't have no I have no desire to run.
[00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:12.560]   I think you just take yourself money.
[00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:13.260]   I don't need it.
[00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:17.060]   I have to play this some this little jingle for you guys.
[00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:20.460]   I don't let me see here if I can feed it to you both.
[00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:22.360]   Jeff Smith who does this great.
[00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:28.960]   I jingles for he did the twit theme and he did he does jingles for podcast.
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:30.760]   He said you guys need this.
[00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:33.560]   Put all of your stuff on a drone.
[00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:35.160]   Oh.
[00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:41.260]   It's Drobo time time to mention the Drobo the fine.
[00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:43.560]   Drobo I got to play that again.
[00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:44.560]   I just love it.
[00:34:44.560 --> 00:35:03.460]   Yes, the Drobo the Drobo is the extra drive that makes you so happy to smile because it gets bigger and bigger all the way up to 16 terabytes add new stuff to your Drobo just put a new drive in and you can store more and now save $25 on the Drobo.
[00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:07.060]   You mentioned Mac break weekly go to Drobo.com.
[00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:07.860]   I can't keep it up.
[00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:11.460]   Go to Drobo.com slash Mac break.
[00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:13.260]   Drobo do you use it?
[00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:17.460]   You OK now Don McAllister you've got massive storage requirements.
[00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:19.160]   Surely you use a Drobo.
[00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:23.260]   Well, to be honest, I've been considering getting one to be honest now.
[00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:26.360]   Yeah, I already have I already have massive storage.
[00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:29.560]   I've got two big raid arrays, but the problem is I have to mirror the two raid.
[00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:34.260]   So I've got about three terabytes in each raid array, but because they're raid five.
[00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:36.260]   I think it's no, they're not raid five.
[00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:37.660]   The raid raid one.
[00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:39.060]   It's the one where the strive anyway.
[00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:41.060]   So there's no raid five.
[00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:44.160]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, the card I've got doesn't support raid five.
[00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:52.160]   So basically got I've got five 750 gigabyte drives in one raid array and then I duplicate that the other raid array just in case one of them goes.
[00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:55.160]   But the speed is great, but for long term storage, it's not really feasible.
[00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:57.260]   So Drobo is a solution.
[00:35:57.260 --> 00:35:59.160]   Drobo is like raid five, but better.
[00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:01.760]   The same idea you can swap out drives.
[00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:03.160]   If a drive dies, you just pull it.
[00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:03.960]   You don't lose any data.
[00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:08.560]   You put a new one in or if you need more storage, you take the low, the smallest drive you replace it.
[00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:11.260]   The Drobo actually tell you it has these great lights in the front.
[00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:14.360]   So if the light goes orange, that means we're running low on this drive.
[00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:15.360]   You just pop that drive out.
[00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:16.460]   You don't even have to shut the Drobo down.
[00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:19.260]   You just pop the drive out, put a fresh drive, a larger drive in.
[00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:20.660]   It rebuilds itself.
[00:36:20.660 --> 00:36:22.060]   You don't lose a drop of data.
[00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:29.160]   But unlike raid five, which is the problem with the raid five is it's it's it's say four discs.
[00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:30.860]   But they often be the same size.
[00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:35.660]   So if you put mixed sizes in it's of the lowest size you put in, the Drobo is smart enough to say,
[00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:42.660]   no, you got a sick 160 of 250 to 750, whatever and add them all up and make that be the total available amount to you.
[00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:44.360]   Actually, some of it's reserved for redundancy.
[00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:45.760]   That's how it protects your data.
[00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:47.060]   Drobo is fantastic.
[00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:54.260]   The new separate second generation Drobo is Firewire 800 as well as USB 2.0 and you get $25 off either.
[00:36:54.360 --> 00:37:04.260]   The original Drobo with USB at a new lower price with a second generation Drobo with five Firewire 800 and USB 2.0 faster speeds cooler and quieter operation.
[00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:08.960]   All you got to do is go to Drobo.com/Macbreak.
[00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:12.460]   Don't forget put all of your data on a Drobo.
[00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:18.960]   I'm doing the after free.
[00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:19.860]   I just want to play the jingle.
[00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:20.360]   That's all.
[00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:24.560]   And it makes me really want one.
[00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:25.660]   I really want Drobo now.
[00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:27.060]   Yeah, I should have a Drobo.
[00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:27.860]   Drobo's are great.
[00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:33.360]   You know, I, you, but see the bad things you buy one and you want another one and you want another one.
[00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:38.060]   You can, I mean, I could, I could, once you start having, you know, terabytes of storage,
[00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:40.160]   suddenly everything seems to expand to fill it.
[00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:43.360]   You got more and more stuff all of the time.
[00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:46.160]   So let's move on.
[00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:48.160]   We were talking about the touch.
[00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:53.160]   Anything else that I miss anything in the new, the new touch that's swoopy doopy design.
[00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:55.960]   Is there any reason Chris, I should abandon my old.
[00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:57.160]   I still like my old touch.
[00:37:57.160 --> 00:37:58.660]   Should I trade it in for the new one?
[00:37:58.660 --> 00:37:59.560]   Not really.
[00:37:59.560 --> 00:37:59.960]   No.
[00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:05.360]   You know, I think if the speaker was much, much better, that would be tempting, but it's not.
[00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:11.360]   The external volume controls are nice, you know, if you don't like having to pull your touch out of your.
[00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:15.860]   That was always my objection to touch is that you couldn't just reach in your pocket and turn it down.
[00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:16.460]   Yeah.
[00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:18.860]   So it's, it's nice that you can now do that.
[00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:24.960]   But other than that, you know, the software brings you the genius feature.
[00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:33.860]   And actually the 2.0, 2.1 software is so far proving to be a nice improvement just in terms of thinking your applications
[00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:39.960]   from the eye touch because it's just, you know, it's deadly slow in the past, whenever you tried to update something from the app store.
[00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:41.360]   Much faster now.
[00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:46.260]   Now this 2.1 is not the same as the iPhones 2.1.
[00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:50.560]   That comes out on Friday, but this is, you know, it's the same guts in there.
[00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:51.060]   Okay.
[00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:52.060]   Hey, I got to, I got to wait a minute.
[00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:56.260]   I got Paul Minshell sent us a, this is, this is getting out of control.
[00:38:56.260 --> 00:38:57.060]   Another jingle.
[00:38:57.060 --> 00:38:58.960]   This is, this is for the Drobo.
[00:38:58.960 --> 00:38:59.960]   Thank you, Paul.
[00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:01.960]   I'm sorry.
[00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:03.960]   I'm just nuts for jingles.
[00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:06.960]   You have to get the Drupal guy to do you one.
[00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:07.960]   Yeah.
[00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:08.960]   Did you hear that?
[00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:09.960]   They were on floss.
[00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:10.960]   Yeah.
[00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:11.960]   Yeah.
[00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:13.960]   You'll hear it's going to be on the floss weekly on Friday.
[00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:18.960]   Jeff Robbins, who is the guy, I was a, you know, great Drupal designer also was in a rock band called Orbit.
[00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:21.960]   Some years ago, he does great stuff.
[00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:22.960]   He does the Drupal.
[00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:25.960]   That was the worst song, the Drupal theme song.
[00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:26.960]   Drupal Drupal Drupal.
[00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:28.960]   So tell us what's going to be.
[00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:35.960]   What's in, you know, my iPhone, I got to say, I went on a trip yesterday to LA.
[00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:38.960]   iPhones were getting the car and it came out.
[00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:42.960]   And it came out to me and I was like, I'm going to be a little bit more like that.
[00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:44.960]   And I was like, I'm going to go back to the car.
[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:49.960]   I'm going to go back to the store yesterday to LA.
[00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:50.960]   iPhones were getting great.
[00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:52.960]   I get in the car and it crashes.
[00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:55.960]   And I'm without a phone until I can get somewhere to restore the thing.
[00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:57.960]   It's crashed so often.
[00:39:57.960 --> 00:40:01.960]   I pretty much connected this to over the air installs or updates.
[00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:06.960]   If I don't mess with the applications, everything seems to be okay.
[00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:08.960]   What are they saying about 2.1?
[00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:09.960]   Is it going to fix this problem?
[00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:10.960]   Is it going to add any capabilities?
[00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:11.960]   Are going to be cut and paste?
[00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:12.960]   What are we going to see on Friday?
[00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:19.960]   I was near the back of the auditorium and when Steve talked about 2.1, you could hear his teeth
[00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:20.960]   gnashing.
[00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:21.960]   Oh.
[00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:26.960]   To the extent where he said, we know there were bugs in 2.0.
[00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:31.960]   And this was not, you know, like, oh, well, hey, clearly he's not happy about this.
[00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:35.960]   And he said we're going to do things with this update, like fix the drop call.
[00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:37.960]   So that was the first thing out of his mouth.
[00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:39.960]   Have you had drop calls?
[00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:40.960]   Me?
[00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:41.960]   Yeah.
[00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:42.960]   I've had a phone call on myself.
[00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:43.960]   I'm in the building.
[00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:44.960]   Are you kidding me?
[00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:45.960]   How about you, Don?
[00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:46.960]   Drop calls on?
[00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:49.960]   I haven't found it to be worse that way.
[00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:51.960]   Yeah, I've had a few issues.
[00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:54.960]   To be honest, I use it more as a web interface than the natural phone.
[00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:57.960]   So I've not really had that much experience with the phone itself.
[00:40:57.960 --> 00:40:59.960]   But I have found it up until the last release.
[00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:01.960]   It was very crashy with the applications.
[00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:03.960]   And how about you, Bob?
[00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:06.960]   Are you having any problems with your 3G?
[00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:07.960]   No.
[00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:10.960]   I mean, I must be very, very lucky because mine has done nothing, absolutely nothing,
[00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:11.960]   except work brilliantly well.
[00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:16.960]   I mean, it's never, I don't know how to, I want to make it crash now to see what it
[00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:17.960]   does.
[00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:21.960]   Well, I can tell you how to make it crash and install more applications over the air.
[00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:27.120]   That's because that's, well, no, that was a tip I took from you because I'd installed
[00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:28.120]   one thing.
[00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:31.800]   I'm trying to remember what it was and it didn't work and it didn't crash.
[00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:32.800]   But I think that's what happens.
[00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:35.960]   I think you can get these partial installs and then it can't reboot.
[00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:36.960]   Yeah.
[00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:38.520]   And then it just says I can't reboot.
[00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:39.680]   And now you have to restore it.
[00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:41.680]   There's no other way to recover as far as I can tell.
[00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:42.680]   Right.
[00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:45.280]   But now everything I just download, everything directly to iTunes plug in and it goes on
[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:46.680]   there and it's gone and it's been no problem.
[00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:48.680]   I've not, it's not, it's never gone.
[00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:52.720]   I get a better signal on it than I did on my last phone, which is unusual in the UK
[00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:55.680]   because it's, particularly where I live, you don't get a signal at all.
[00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:57.680]   You're talking about the voice, the call signal.
[00:41:57.680 --> 00:41:58.680]   Just a call signal.
[00:41:58.680 --> 00:41:59.680]   Yeah.
[00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:02.080]   But I mean, I'm getting 3G everywhere and I'm getting, you know, it's, and then I keep
[00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:03.080]   it all the time.
[00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:05.680]   All I do is, I just want to make a phone call.
[00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:09.560]   I suddenly realize I'm standing next to someone's house and they've got an open Wi-Fi
[00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:14.320]   and there's a lot of open Wi-Fi in this country, which I'm just amazed at.
[00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:16.720]   And they constantly be, I'm getting a really good Wi-Fi signal.
[00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:20.080]   They say, they say in the US the number one internet service provider is Linksys.
[00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:21.080]   Right.
[00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:23.160]   Nobody ever gets that joke.
[00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:24.720]   I keep telling it.
[00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:25.720]   Someday somebody will get that joke.
[00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:26.720]   I don't get it yet.
[00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:28.920]   I think I mean, no, I haven't got a clue.
[00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:32.760]   But I mean, when I was in the States, I was constantly getting Wi-Fi signals.
[00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:33.760]   Oh yeah.
[00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:34.760]   And I didn't want them.
[00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:35.760]   Yeah.
[00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:36.760]   Oh yeah.
[00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:38.060]   And in fact, that's one thing I'd turn off on the phone right away is let me know if there's
[00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:39.800]   a Wi-Fi signal nearby.
[00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:40.800]   Yes.
[00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:41.800]   That's all the phone goes.
[00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:42.800]   Hello.
[00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:43.800]   Hey, hey, over here.
[00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:44.800]   Hey, I got another.
[00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:45.800]   Oh yeah.
[00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:49.840]   So Chris, did he say, did he say, my biggest problem I have with it is battery life.
[00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:50.840]   That's the thing that I did.
[00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:51.840]   Yes.
[00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:53.000]   Now they did say this would improve battery life.
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   I don't know how.
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   Yes.
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   That's what I'm looking forward to that.
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:59.400]   What kind of magic can a firmware to do?
[00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:03.320]   Chris, do they give you any clues at all about what's coming into one?
[00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:04.320]   Well, no.
[00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:10.580]   I mean, in the iPhone iPod Touch software, they tell you essentially that it fixes some
[00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:16.260]   problems with contacts loading slowly and that pop email is going to work better and
[00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:17.860]   some crashing bugs with applications.
[00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:19.580]   The thinking is going to be faster.
[00:43:19.580 --> 00:43:24.220]   So a lot of the things that people notice right away that why is my iPhone backing up
[00:43:24.220 --> 00:43:25.420]   for two hours?
[00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:27.260]   Does it really need to do that?
[00:43:27.260 --> 00:43:28.980]   That kind of thing is going to be addressed here.
[00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:32.300]   And then again, Steve said, you're not going to experience the kind of drop calls you're
[00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:33.300]   getting.
[00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:37.640]   And hopefully it's going to be the iPhone that we wanted it to be and it worked well
[00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:39.240]   as the first generation.
[00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:45.480]   Ray Maxwell, a friend from Vancouver called on the show and said that the way to shorten
[00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:52.840]   the sync times is to turn off when you first install the iPhone, Apple says, do you want
[00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:59.960]   me to send an anonymous data back to our servers and logs and so forth?
[00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:01.720]   And of course, we're all good citizens.
[00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:03.360]   And we say, yes.
[00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:04.360]   And we also check the box.
[00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:06.120]   It says, don't ask me that again.
[00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:08.240]   Ray said, that's part of the problem.
[00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:12.120]   I don't know if this is you you're the you do the Mac 911 common in Mac world magazines.
[00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:14.180]   If anybody would know about this, it'd be you.
[00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:16.280]   But I did turn that off.
[00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:18.480]   I said, don't send the logs.
[00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:22.000]   I unchecked the box or actually I checked the box after saying no, I checked the box
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:23.960]   to say no, so it doesn't bother me anymore.
[00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:27.060]   And that does seem to have sped up the sink.
[00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:30.720]   The other thing, of course, is to do not have it back up because the backup takes forever.
[00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:36.520]   Yeah, it's the most expedient thing is simply to click that little X and say, don't.
[00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:37.520]   Yes.
[00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:39.200]   And then they continue to the sink, right?
[00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:40.200]   You just say good.
[00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:42.040]   They should have a setting though, says don't back up.
[00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:43.840]   Yeah, they absolutely should.
[00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:49.040]   The other thing you can do to is when you go and look into your library of old applications,
[00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:52.200]   you see that keeps every version that you've ever had.
[00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:56.440]   Do you clear some of that stuff out that can speed up think as well?
[00:44:56.440 --> 00:44:58.760]   Every version of the backups you mean?
[00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:02.320]   Every version of, well, yeah, one is so you can get rid of all the backups because it
[00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:04.160]   keeps multiple backups.
[00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:10.560]   Also, if you update an application, it throws yet another copy of that into a folder.
[00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:14.520]   So now you're just accumulating different versions of Twitter, or whatever it is.
[00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:15.800]   We didn't know that.
[00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:17.280]   Where's that?
[00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:20.320]   It's buried in your iTunes folder in iTunes.
[00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:22.520]   Oh, I had no idea.
[00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:25.680]   Okay, so I'm going to, so that's good.
[00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:29.800]   And I don't want the backups because whenever I have to restore the iPhone, and I've done
[00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:34.120]   it about half a dozen times now, I've found that restoring a backup just restores trouble.
[00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:35.840]   The best thing to do is rebuild from scratch.
[00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:36.840]   It's not a big deal.
[00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:37.840]   You're sinking anyway.
[00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:38.840]   Exactly.
[00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:42.560]   So I just let it say, if I think it might be faster than restoring a backup, it's just
[00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:44.760]   start over and let it sink again.
[00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:45.760]   Yeah.
[00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:46.760]   Yeah.
[00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:50.800]   I've seen quite a few thoughts of people getting good results by not plugging the iPhone into
[00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:56.200]   a USB hub and just plugging it directly into your Mac, so by putting the hub.
[00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:59.640]   And that seems to have sorted a few people's problems out as far as the...
[00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:00.640]   I'm using a hub.
[00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:02.440]   Oh, maybe I should do that.
[00:46:02.440 --> 00:46:04.000]   Well, it might be worth giving it a try.
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:05.240]   There's a lot of food who isn't there.
[00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:06.720]   Right, maybe we should be open anyway.
[00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:07.720]   Oh, yeah, right.
[00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:10.360]   Oh, it'll all be better on Friday.
[00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:11.360]   Yeah.
[00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:15.160]   So Bob, you're going to reinstall to when the minute it comes out, or are you one of those
[00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:17.760]   smart people that says, "Oh, wait and see what happens."
[00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:18.760]   No, no.
[00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:19.760]   I always go.
[00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:22.440]   But when it comes to software updates, I'm an earlier doctor.
[00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:23.440]   I go straight in there.
[00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:24.440]   Impetuous.
[00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:25.440]   Yeah.
[00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:26.440]   Absolutely.
[00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:27.440]   The instant it comes out.
[00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:28.440]   Oh, it's got to be better.
[00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:29.440]   It's too one.
[00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:30.440]   It's just going to be better.
[00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:31.440]   Yeah.
[00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:32.440]   It's too one.
[00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:33.440]   It's got my numbers.
[00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:34.440]   It's got to be better.
[00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:35.440]   I wonder if you've got to...
[00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:36.440]   Sorry, I...
[00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:37.440]   Go ahead.
[00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:38.440]   Go ahead, Doug.
[00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:41.280]   I wonder if they're going to change the way we install because at the last major update,
[00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:44.480]   I mean, it didn't brick people's phones, but it actually stopped people's phones for
[00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:49.620]   working for six or seven hours in some instances because they couldn't finish off the
[00:46:49.620 --> 00:46:50.620]   process to soon activate.
[00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:51.620]   Yeah.
[00:46:51.620 --> 00:46:52.620]   I wonder what they're going to do.
[00:46:52.620 --> 00:46:56.880]   Maybe they'll stage the rollout, you think, to avoid that?
[00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:58.040]   So there would be an advantage.
[00:46:58.040 --> 00:47:01.540]   There would be an advantage to wait in that case, especially if you needed the phone that
[00:47:01.540 --> 00:47:02.540]   day.
[00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:03.540]   Yeah.
[00:47:03.540 --> 00:47:04.540]   Let's get to the point.
[00:47:04.540 --> 00:47:10.100]   I have to say, my iPhone has crashed so often that I actually now bring a backup phone.
[00:47:10.100 --> 00:47:11.340]   That's pathetic, isn't it?
[00:47:11.340 --> 00:47:12.340]   That's a sterling test.
[00:47:12.340 --> 00:47:13.340]   That's a phone.
[00:47:13.340 --> 00:47:18.420]   Oh, if you're going to use the iPhone, make sure you have a second line just in case.
[00:47:18.420 --> 00:47:19.820]   It's a testament to two things.
[00:47:19.820 --> 00:47:25.980]   One, it's unreliability, of course, but two, that Mac people are fanatical and crazy because
[00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:27.660]   I'm still going to bring my phone with me.
[00:47:27.660 --> 00:47:30.900]   I'm not going to give it up, which is the logical thing to do.
[00:47:30.900 --> 00:47:32.380]   We give it up.
[00:47:32.380 --> 00:47:37.100]   Oh, well, I guess maybe I'm just unlucky.
[00:47:37.100 --> 00:47:38.100]   Anything else?
[00:47:38.100 --> 00:47:39.780]   Chris, are you the type that's going to back do it right away?
[00:47:39.780 --> 00:47:40.780]   I guess you have to.
[00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:41.780]   It's your job.
[00:47:41.780 --> 00:47:45.140]   Yeah, part of my job to do it, and I'm also a jailbreaker.
[00:47:45.140 --> 00:47:50.620]   So I general hold off if I can to wait for the jailbreak to come out.
[00:47:50.620 --> 00:47:53.100]   But no, I have this one.
[00:47:53.100 --> 00:47:55.660]   I have a couple of other iPhones though that I can jailbreak still.
[00:47:55.660 --> 00:47:59.940]   So the work phone for testing purposes, yeah, it's all up.
[00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:01.540]   That as soon as I can.
[00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:02.540]   You need two.
[00:48:02.540 --> 00:48:05.660]   You need one for jailbreak and one kind of clean phone.
[00:48:05.660 --> 00:48:11.260]   One clean phone and then one that my daughter can watch Wizard of Oz on.
[00:48:11.260 --> 00:48:13.540]   Are you a jailbreaker, Adon McAllister?
[00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:14.540]   Screencast on the phone?
[00:48:14.540 --> 00:48:17.140]   Yes, I've got my very first phone.
[00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:18.620]   It says jailbroken.
[00:48:18.620 --> 00:48:20.340]   But I did that for a specific reason.
[00:48:20.340 --> 00:48:24.020]   That was to get screenshots for some of the shows I used to do.
[00:48:24.020 --> 00:48:29.420]   But since the new version of the 3G, we can get screenshots off the true book of phone.
[00:48:29.420 --> 00:48:31.020]   That's a nice feature, isn't it?
[00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:32.700]   Yeah, it's really nice.
[00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:35.500]   So much easier than the old way we used to have to do it.
[00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:39.060]   You press the top button and the start, the two buttons, you press them.
[00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:40.740]   Yeah, press them momentarily.
[00:48:40.740 --> 00:48:44.060]   And then it takes a screenshot and dumps it into your camera roll.
[00:48:44.060 --> 00:48:46.660]   And then you can just sync it with iPhoto in a way you go.
[00:48:46.660 --> 00:48:48.940]   They didn't make a big deal about that.
[00:48:48.940 --> 00:48:52.100]   But that I think is one of the nicest additional features of the new life.
[00:48:52.100 --> 00:48:53.580]   I really like that.
[00:48:53.580 --> 00:48:54.740]   Especially for somebody like you.
[00:48:54.740 --> 00:48:56.540]   What a great assistant.
[00:48:56.540 --> 00:49:00.660]   Yeah, I just want someone to develop a screencast application for it.
[00:49:00.660 --> 00:49:02.380]   So I can actually record the transitions and things.
[00:49:02.380 --> 00:49:03.380]   Because I can't take a movie.
[00:49:03.380 --> 00:49:04.620]   I can take still shots.
[00:49:04.620 --> 00:49:08.340]   And the way I represent them in the show is just to do sort of like a slideshow.
[00:49:08.340 --> 00:49:09.740]   Still frames, yeah.
[00:49:09.740 --> 00:49:15.140]   I can animate it in some respects, but it would be nice to have a proper screencast tool for
[00:49:15.140 --> 00:49:16.140]   the iPhone.
[00:49:16.140 --> 00:49:18.140]   Have you talked to anybody who's working on that?
[00:49:18.140 --> 00:49:19.140]   No, not really.
[00:49:19.140 --> 00:49:20.140]   Not really.
[00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:24.540]   I mean, people can, developers can do it themselves because they've got the development kit and
[00:49:24.540 --> 00:49:27.180]   you can actually run a simulation of your app on the Mac.
[00:49:27.180 --> 00:49:28.380]   And you can just tweak it.
[00:49:28.380 --> 00:49:29.380]   Yeah.
[00:49:29.380 --> 00:49:31.380]   The problem is, though, is other people can't do that.
[00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:36.620]   So there was one developer, the guys over at OnePass would, we were going to do it.
[00:49:36.620 --> 00:49:38.860]   But in the end, I just decided not against it.
[00:49:38.860 --> 00:49:41.900]   But they included me within their development team, which was really nice of them.
[00:49:41.900 --> 00:49:46.060]   So I could have downloaded their app and ran it within the development environment and
[00:49:46.060 --> 00:49:47.060]   done a screen capture.
[00:49:47.060 --> 00:49:49.180]   But I can't do that for every application I cover.
[00:49:49.180 --> 00:49:53.260]   So I'm just waiting for a screen capture app to come out for the iPhone.
[00:49:53.260 --> 00:49:57.420]   We're going to get to your picks in just a second.
[00:49:57.420 --> 00:50:01.980]   Any other, have we left anything out, Chris, from the announcement?
[00:50:01.980 --> 00:50:03.740]   Steve is still alive.
[00:50:03.740 --> 00:50:09.900]   There's a new long, tall nano with the same size screen, even though it looks bigger.
[00:50:09.900 --> 00:50:11.900]   New iPod touch.
[00:50:11.900 --> 00:50:12.900]   Yeah.
[00:50:12.900 --> 00:50:18.580]   One thing they did this time that was unusual, they haven't done it much in the past, is
[00:50:18.580 --> 00:50:22.700]   they really emphasized the whole green aspect of these things.
[00:50:22.700 --> 00:50:23.700]   Oh, yeah.
[00:50:23.700 --> 00:50:25.500]   They really, but this has been a new initiative for them, hasn't it?
[00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:26.500]   Yeah.
[00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:27.500]   And they did it twice.
[00:50:27.500 --> 00:50:28.500]   Yeah.
[00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:29.500]   Two times.
[00:50:29.500 --> 00:50:31.940]   And I already talked about the packaging and how recyclable these things were without
[00:50:31.940 --> 00:50:37.220]   also saying, and please buy more, with a new push for them.
[00:50:37.220 --> 00:50:40.180]   And I'm glad to see them doing it.
[00:50:40.180 --> 00:50:43.980]   And it didn't appear to be a reaction to Greenpeace jumping on their backs because they
[00:50:43.980 --> 00:50:45.980]   haven't done that in a while.
[00:50:45.980 --> 00:50:47.940]   But it's the right thing to do.
[00:50:47.940 --> 00:50:49.420]   And they made sure they talked about it.
[00:50:49.420 --> 00:50:55.100]   I have to say, when I see things like arsenic free glass, I want to say, but are you saying
[00:50:55.100 --> 00:50:57.940]   there's arsenic in other glass or are you just saying there's no arsenic in this glass?
[00:50:57.940 --> 00:51:00.580]   It's like, and this glass is not radioactive.
[00:51:00.580 --> 00:51:01.580]   Right.
[00:51:01.580 --> 00:51:03.460]   It's unlike your window.
[00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:04.460]   Right.
[00:51:04.460 --> 00:51:06.500]   Is there arsenic in glass?
[00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:07.700]   I guess so.
[00:51:07.700 --> 00:51:09.420]   Is it a problem?
[00:51:09.420 --> 00:51:14.140]   I guess so.
[00:51:14.140 --> 00:51:15.900]   Not made with nuclear power plants.
[00:51:15.900 --> 00:51:21.540]   I mean, from what I know about glass manufacturing, which is fairly minimal, arsenic is used
[00:51:21.540 --> 00:51:23.580]   in the process of producing glass.
[00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:25.020]   It's not actually in the glass.
[00:51:25.020 --> 00:51:28.780]   So therefore, presumably there is arsenic waste products.
[00:51:28.780 --> 00:51:29.780]   I get it.
[00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:35.020]   So it's not like if you lit glass, you get arsenic poisoning.
[00:51:35.020 --> 00:51:36.820]   Do not suck the glass, sir.
[00:51:36.820 --> 00:51:37.820]   Don't eat the glass.
[00:51:37.820 --> 00:51:38.820]   Stand away from the glass.
[00:51:38.820 --> 00:51:46.420]   But I think, I mean, as I've been around a big plant that produces fiberglass insulation
[00:51:46.420 --> 00:51:52.740]   for heat insulation, and they are certainly a point where we couldn't go into the particular
[00:51:52.740 --> 00:51:55.060]   machine because it was spraying arsenic off.
[00:51:55.060 --> 00:51:56.060]   Oh, interesting.
[00:51:56.060 --> 00:51:57.620]   But that's then rinsed off.
[00:51:57.620 --> 00:51:59.700]   And it's part of the process of producing it.
[00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:03.540]   So that, and as far as I know, that is also used in sheet glass manufacturing as well.
[00:52:03.540 --> 00:52:05.940]   So this iPod would be safe for internal consumption.
[00:52:05.940 --> 00:52:08.620]   I think you can swallow it and have no problem.
[00:52:08.620 --> 00:52:09.620]   Nope.
[00:52:09.620 --> 00:52:12.220]   And the new shape makes it pass right through.
[00:52:12.220 --> 00:52:13.220]   Yeah.
[00:52:13.220 --> 00:52:14.220]   Of course.
[00:52:14.220 --> 00:52:16.020]   If you go on and trampoline, you'll be fine.
[00:52:16.020 --> 00:52:17.380]   Shuffle, shuffle!
[00:52:17.380 --> 00:52:19.620]   No, they did.
[00:52:19.620 --> 00:52:20.620]   I saw that.
[00:52:20.620 --> 00:52:26.100]   That checklist for both the nano and the, I was at the touch also that they did it.
[00:52:26.100 --> 00:52:28.020]   Of all, their green checklist.
[00:52:28.020 --> 00:52:29.020]   Yeah.
[00:52:29.020 --> 00:52:30.820]   Well, good for, you know, that's fine.
[00:52:30.820 --> 00:52:31.820]   Good.
[00:52:31.820 --> 00:52:35.460]   He's, you know, he did, he mentioned on the air he mentioned, you know, packaging, the
[00:52:35.460 --> 00:52:36.460]   small.
[00:52:36.460 --> 00:52:37.460]   I mean, they're become very aware of that.
[00:52:37.460 --> 00:52:38.460]   That's, that's Steve.
[00:52:38.460 --> 00:52:42.980]   Steve is very crunchy granola.
[00:52:42.980 --> 00:52:44.500]   That's who he is, I think.
[00:52:44.500 --> 00:52:45.500]   Yeah.
[00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:46.500]   Yeah.
[00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:48.900]   And it's, again, it's nice to see that this didn't come from pressure, but really,
[00:52:48.900 --> 00:52:49.900]   right.
[00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:53.060]   They meant they wanted to do something out and, yeah.
[00:52:53.060 --> 00:52:58.300]   I think the big takeaway for me from, from the overall event was, was how much they're
[00:52:58.300 --> 00:53:01.340]   pushing the iPod touch as a games platform now.
[00:53:01.340 --> 00:53:02.340]   Yeah.
[00:53:02.340 --> 00:53:03.340]   Especially the holiday season coming up.
[00:53:03.340 --> 00:53:06.180]   I mean, they really did push the game side a bit very, very hard.
[00:53:06.180 --> 00:53:09.340]   Well, they even say on the front page, the funnest iPod ever.
[00:53:09.340 --> 00:53:10.340]   Oh, yeah.
[00:53:10.340 --> 00:53:12.300]   That's the worst slogan, by the way.
[00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:15.860]   You think that was, that became the slogan after Steve said it on stage, or they actually
[00:53:15.860 --> 00:53:16.860]   planned that?
[00:53:16.860 --> 00:53:19.100]   No, it's on a slide.
[00:53:19.100 --> 00:53:20.100]   It's actually on the slide.
[00:53:20.100 --> 00:53:21.100]   Oh, wow.
[00:53:21.100 --> 00:53:22.100]   So it's, yeah.
[00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:26.180]   The thing is, I thought it said the funniest iPod ever, because I can just reading it as
[00:53:26.180 --> 00:53:27.180]   the funnest.
[00:53:27.180 --> 00:53:28.180]   It sounds good.
[00:53:28.180 --> 00:53:29.180]   And grammatical.
[00:53:29.180 --> 00:53:30.180]   Is that grammatical even?
[00:53:30.180 --> 00:53:34.020]   Oh, there's lots of twits and blog posts about it.
[00:53:34.020 --> 00:53:38.420]   So I think people are going down into the depths of grammatical correctness to find out
[00:53:38.420 --> 00:53:39.420]   if you're right or not.
[00:53:39.420 --> 00:53:43.900]   I think it's the most fun iPod ever, not the funnest.
[00:53:43.900 --> 00:53:44.900]   Very strange.
[00:53:44.900 --> 00:53:45.900]   Honest is a word.
[00:53:45.900 --> 00:53:48.100]   Yeah, but I look who they're appealing to by saying that.
[00:53:48.100 --> 00:53:49.100]   The funnest iPod ever.
[00:53:49.100 --> 00:53:50.100]   I don't know who.
[00:53:50.100 --> 00:53:51.100]   It's the cat that's basically the cat.
[00:53:51.100 --> 00:53:52.100]   It's the cat.
[00:53:52.100 --> 00:53:53.100]   It's the cat, eh?
[00:53:53.100 --> 00:53:54.100]   It's the cat.
[00:53:54.100 --> 00:53:55.100]   It's the cat.
[00:53:55.100 --> 00:53:58.100]   They just, they might as well have a slogan, "I heart iPod."
[00:53:58.100 --> 00:53:59.900]   There you go.
[00:53:59.900 --> 00:54:02.820]   iPod for you are cool.
[00:54:02.820 --> 00:54:03.820]   Yeah.
[00:54:03.820 --> 00:54:04.820]   K-E-W-L.
[00:54:04.820 --> 00:54:06.780]   Oh, well, I guess I'm in that.
[00:54:06.780 --> 00:54:10.100]   I have less problem with funnest than I used to with Think Different.
[00:54:10.100 --> 00:54:12.820]   Yeah, because it'd be different Lee, right?
[00:54:12.820 --> 00:54:13.820]   Yeah.
[00:54:13.820 --> 00:54:14.820]   Yes.
[00:54:14.820 --> 00:54:16.820]   I just used to see those big posters and go, "That's very bad.
[00:54:16.820 --> 00:54:17.820]   I don't quite know."
[00:54:17.820 --> 00:54:20.300]   It's just not proper English, for goodness sake.
[00:54:20.300 --> 00:54:23.500]   Well, now you guys are very finicky.
[00:54:23.500 --> 00:54:30.020]   I think did not, did not one of the Switch ads get banned in Britain because it was untrue.
[00:54:30.020 --> 00:54:31.620]   I believe that's the case.
[00:54:31.620 --> 00:54:35.740]   It was the one about the, no, it wasn't a Switch ad.
[00:54:35.740 --> 00:54:39.820]   It was the ad for the iPhone saying you had the all of the internet and because it didn't
[00:54:39.820 --> 00:54:42.900]   support Flash, that wasn't all the internet.
[00:54:42.900 --> 00:54:46.060]   Oh, right on.
[00:54:46.060 --> 00:54:47.060]   Right on.
[00:54:47.060 --> 00:54:49.900]   In some respects, you can't really.
[00:54:49.900 --> 00:54:52.500]   The advertising standards agency upheld a complaint.
[00:54:52.500 --> 00:54:56.380]   So, something complained about a TV spot for the iPhone which claimed that all the parts
[00:54:56.380 --> 00:55:00.620]   of the internet are on the iPhone, but of course, Flash and Java are not.
[00:55:00.620 --> 00:55:02.340]   Well, I think that that's accurate.
[00:55:02.340 --> 00:55:05.500]   They should, that is a lie.
[00:55:05.500 --> 00:55:06.500]   I don't think I've seen that.
[00:55:06.500 --> 00:55:10.540]   Just I guess very nearly all the internet, all the internet isn't quite as good a-
[00:55:10.540 --> 00:55:12.140]   Almost all the internet.
[00:55:12.140 --> 00:55:16.300]   Almost absolutely nearly every single tiny little bit of almost some of the-
[00:55:16.300 --> 00:55:17.300]   Except a few things.
[00:55:17.300 --> 00:55:20.300]   A few things.
[00:55:20.300 --> 00:55:22.460]   Not to be taken internally.
[00:55:22.460 --> 00:55:24.900]   Do not lick the glass.
[00:55:24.900 --> 00:55:27.700]   Do not lick the glass, whatever you do.
[00:55:27.700 --> 00:55:33.140]   All right, so what else, anything else from the event, Chris, that you wanted to bring
[00:55:33.140 --> 00:55:34.620]   up any other observations?
[00:55:34.620 --> 00:55:35.620]   No.
[00:55:35.620 --> 00:55:36.620]   That was the audience.
[00:55:36.620 --> 00:55:43.460]   Was the audience the usual clack of uncritical Apple fanboys or were they a little less?
[00:55:43.460 --> 00:55:47.620]   Well, it was the usual journalist crowd.
[00:55:47.620 --> 00:55:49.820]   Mossberg was not there.
[00:55:49.820 --> 00:55:51.220]   Polk was not there.
[00:55:51.220 --> 00:55:54.420]   Dan Lyons was there as the new news week.
[00:55:54.420 --> 00:55:56.580]   The fake Steve Jobs is there?
[00:55:56.580 --> 00:55:58.620]   Fake Steve Jobs was there.
[00:55:58.620 --> 00:55:59.620]   Wow.
[00:55:59.620 --> 00:56:02.700]   Did he take over for Steven Levy?
[00:56:02.700 --> 00:56:05.220]   He's Newsweek's new kind of geek guy, right?
[00:56:05.220 --> 00:56:08.020]   Yeah, Levy went off to Wired, I think.
[00:56:08.020 --> 00:56:12.220]   And so Dan Lyons, the old fake Jobs, is now at Newsweek and they-
[00:56:12.220 --> 00:56:14.220]   We'll see him at these events.
[00:56:14.220 --> 00:56:15.220]   Yeah.
[00:56:15.220 --> 00:56:19.460]   Are you surprised, disappointed that there were not announcements about, for instance,
[00:56:19.460 --> 00:56:20.460]   a new MacBook Air?
[00:56:20.460 --> 00:56:21.460]   I was.
[00:56:21.460 --> 00:56:22.460]   But that was just personal.
[00:56:22.460 --> 00:56:24.020]   I wanted a new MacBook Air.
[00:56:24.020 --> 00:56:25.620]   Yeah, but this is September.
[00:56:25.620 --> 00:56:26.860]   It's the iPod time.
[00:56:26.860 --> 00:56:29.340]   So they'll do that event sometime.
[00:56:29.340 --> 00:56:32.460]   But they really, I mean, they barely mentioned the iPhone.
[00:56:32.460 --> 00:56:34.100]   They said, "Yes, that's Friday."
[00:56:34.100 --> 00:56:37.740]   But that was really all about the holidays and the iPod.
[00:56:37.740 --> 00:56:41.980]   And they did, now, do you agree because I had read some, in some places, that Apple,
[00:56:41.980 --> 00:56:44.980]   PR people were calling journalists and saying, "You really ought to come to this one?
[00:56:44.980 --> 00:56:46.580]   It's going to be big.
[00:56:46.580 --> 00:56:47.580]   Did you get a call?
[00:56:47.580 --> 00:56:48.580]   I got a call.
[00:56:48.580 --> 00:56:49.580]   Did you get a call like that?"
[00:56:49.580 --> 00:56:54.260]   No, I got an invitation, though, which was nice because normally-
[00:56:54.260 --> 00:56:55.620]   The back world gets it.
[00:56:55.620 --> 00:56:58.540]   But an invitation back world, but they sent me a personal one.
[00:56:58.540 --> 00:56:59.540]   Good.
[00:56:59.540 --> 00:57:00.540]   That's nice.
[00:57:00.540 --> 00:57:01.540]   You know, Teresa Calmings.
[00:57:01.540 --> 00:57:04.820]   And I heard from a couple of people that they were getting calls from PR like, "Don't
[00:57:04.820 --> 00:57:07.460]   want to miss this one," which makes it feel like it's going to be something bigger.
[00:57:07.460 --> 00:57:10.660]   But it was exactly what we thought it was going to be, really.
[00:57:10.660 --> 00:57:11.660]   Yes.
[00:57:11.660 --> 00:57:12.740]   All right.
[00:57:12.740 --> 00:57:16.620]   Our picks are coming up in just a moment, but of course it's time to mention one more
[00:57:16.620 --> 00:57:17.780]   sponsor.
[00:57:17.780 --> 00:57:22.340]   This show is so popular with the advertisers, we should sell more ads.
[00:57:22.340 --> 00:57:23.540]   It's brought me my visa.
[00:57:23.540 --> 00:57:26.540]   I don't have a jingle for- Wait a minute.
[00:57:26.540 --> 00:57:27.540]   Maybe I do.
[00:57:27.540 --> 00:57:29.300]   I should check my jingle drawer.
[00:57:29.300 --> 00:57:30.780]   I have all sorts of stuff.
[00:57:30.780 --> 00:57:31.780]   Wait a minute.
[00:57:31.780 --> 00:57:34.140]   Maybe I do have a little something for visa here.
[00:57:34.140 --> 00:57:36.460]   All right, now I get it.
[00:57:36.460 --> 00:57:40.340]   I've got to give them some credit for being safe and secure.
[00:57:40.340 --> 00:57:41.900]   No problems, they're sure.
[00:57:41.900 --> 00:57:44.020]   It's visa, visa, visa, visa, visa.
[00:57:44.020 --> 00:57:48.380]   If you go shopping online for that nice new nano, you're going to want to get yourself
[00:57:48.380 --> 00:57:52.300]   a nice little visa card to protect yourself every time you shop online.
[00:57:52.300 --> 00:57:57.420]   Visa does it's utmost to protect you, to detect or resolve, to prevent online fraud so that
[00:57:57.420 --> 00:58:00.220]   when you go shopping online or off.
[00:58:00.220 --> 00:58:02.740]   Again, with the explosions.
[00:58:02.740 --> 00:58:07.220]   Are you adjusting your screen when I talk?
[00:58:07.220 --> 00:58:08.980]   Is that what's going on, Robert?
[00:58:08.980 --> 00:58:11.580]   I've come to a big mood.
[00:58:11.580 --> 00:58:15.380]   I'm sitting here frozen in terror.
[00:58:15.380 --> 00:58:17.020]   You may not move.
[00:58:17.020 --> 00:58:20.020]   No, I'm marginally adjusted my screen.
[00:58:20.020 --> 00:58:21.500]   Like a quarter of a century.
[00:58:21.500 --> 00:58:23.380]   It sounded like crack a toa.
[00:58:23.380 --> 00:58:26.980]   There's a new island somewhere in the Pacific.
[00:58:26.980 --> 00:58:27.980]   No, I'm just teasing you.
[00:58:27.980 --> 00:58:28.980]   I don't care.
[00:58:28.980 --> 00:58:33.460]   It's part of the rough and tumble nature of Mac break weekly.
[00:58:33.460 --> 00:58:37.300]   We never know what's going to happen, but do use your visa card because Visa makes sure
[00:58:37.300 --> 00:58:41.340]   all your purchases online are off or safe and secure.
[00:58:41.340 --> 00:58:43.140]   That's peace of mind.
[00:58:43.140 --> 00:58:44.140]   That's visa.
[00:58:44.140 --> 00:58:45.140]   Hit it, Jeff.
[00:58:45.140 --> 00:58:46.140]   All right.
[00:58:46.140 --> 00:58:47.140]   Now I get it.
[00:58:47.140 --> 00:58:50.820]   I've got to give them some credit for being safe and secure.
[00:58:50.820 --> 00:58:52.380]   No problems, they're sure.
[00:58:52.380 --> 00:58:54.820]   It's visa, visa, visa, visa.
[00:58:54.820 --> 00:58:58.660]   All Jeff Smith and his magic guitar.
[00:58:58.660 --> 00:59:00.620]   So time for our picks of the week.
[00:59:00.620 --> 00:59:03.300]   I didn't warn anybody on the panel that we were going to do this.
[00:59:03.300 --> 00:59:04.980]   So you don't have to do a pick.
[00:59:04.980 --> 00:59:09.700]   But while you're thinking, I'm going to steal your pick because the pick of the week, there's
[00:59:09.700 --> 00:59:13.580]   no question in my mind whatsoever is spore.
[00:59:13.580 --> 00:59:14.580]   Unbelievable.
[00:59:14.580 --> 00:59:19.580]   And I want to thank Maxis and electronic arts for releasing a Mac version at the same time
[00:59:19.580 --> 00:59:20.980]   as they released the Windows version.
[00:59:20.980 --> 00:59:22.340]   This is so much fun.
[00:59:22.340 --> 00:59:23.340]   Has anybody ever played this?
[00:59:23.340 --> 00:59:25.860]   Bob, your kids must have, your son must have played spore.
[00:59:25.860 --> 00:59:28.260]   I don't think he has yet, though.
[00:59:28.260 --> 00:59:32.260]   He's not, well, I haven't been at home for a week, so I don't know.
[00:59:32.260 --> 00:59:34.820]   Well, it's like it's pouring away as we speak.
[00:59:34.820 --> 00:59:36.740]   He's reproducing magically.
[00:59:36.740 --> 00:59:39.940]   It's the kind of game you want your kids to play because it's not a shoot them up.
[00:59:39.940 --> 00:59:41.980]   There's enough violence to make it fun.
[00:59:41.980 --> 00:59:44.420]   You choose at the beginning, you're a single-celled organism.
[00:59:44.420 --> 00:59:46.620]   You choose one thing at the beginning.
[00:59:46.620 --> 00:59:49.460]   Am I going to be a carnivore or an herbivore?
[00:59:49.460 --> 00:59:55.620]   And then you kind of go through life acquiring DNA particles deciding how to, you know, do
[00:59:55.620 --> 00:59:57.980]   I want to add cilia or fins?
[00:59:57.980 --> 00:59:58.980]   Do I want antlers?
[00:59:58.980 --> 01:00:00.660]   You add little capabilities.
[01:00:00.660 --> 01:00:03.780]   You're literally designing this creature through experience.
[01:00:03.780 --> 01:00:05.020]   You're evolving it.
[01:00:05.020 --> 01:00:09.500]   Eventually, you move on to the next stage, you go to land, you walk up on land, you got
[01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:12.140]   to trade in those cilia for legs and things.
[01:00:12.140 --> 01:00:16.580]   And then you go tribal and it goes on through space travel.
[01:00:16.580 --> 01:00:20.220]   And I have to say that there are so many nice touches in this.
[01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:23.980]   You can paint your character, you can share your paintings with other people.
[01:00:23.980 --> 01:00:26.220]   Other people's characters can wander through your scenes.
[01:00:26.220 --> 01:00:29.100]   They're not controlling them, but they're autonomous, but they're still there.
[01:00:29.100 --> 01:00:31.420]   They're part of your life.
[01:00:31.420 --> 01:00:37.180]   There is a sport cast that let you broadcast your sport creatures.
[01:00:37.180 --> 01:00:39.060]   This is going to take the world by storm.
[01:00:39.060 --> 01:00:44.460]   And I just think it's a little pricey about 60 bucks, but I think it is so much fun.
[01:00:44.460 --> 01:00:45.580]   And they've done a nice job.
[01:00:45.580 --> 01:00:47.900]   You can install it on multiple Macs.
[01:00:47.900 --> 01:00:52.900]   You set up an account with EA and that's how it kind of copy protects itself.
[01:00:52.900 --> 01:00:55.100]   I just think this is, you know, it's pricey.
[01:00:55.100 --> 01:00:57.940]   It's 60 bucks, but it is such a fun game.
[01:00:57.940 --> 01:00:59.180]   I have to recommend it.
[01:00:59.180 --> 01:01:02.340]   Spore is my Mac break weekly pick.
[01:01:02.340 --> 01:01:05.140]   Now I haven't, I've only gotten to the tribal stage.
[01:01:05.140 --> 01:01:06.980]   So I haven't, I know spoilers here.
[01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:11.620]   I still got a ways to go, but I have three, three, so it's going to be four different
[01:01:11.620 --> 01:01:12.620]   characters.
[01:01:12.620 --> 01:01:15.300]   Each machine has its own planet and characters on it.
[01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:16.980]   It is so much fun.
[01:01:16.980 --> 01:01:20.820]   Don, Don, I know you must have a pick because you work with so much software at Screencast's
[01:01:20.820 --> 01:01:21.820]   online.
[01:01:21.820 --> 01:01:23.580]   Yeah, well, I'm not going to pimp my show this week.
[01:01:23.580 --> 01:01:26.340]   I'm just going to give you something that I haven't covered yet.
[01:01:26.340 --> 01:01:27.340]   Pimp your show.
[01:01:27.340 --> 01:01:28.340]   Pimp your show.
[01:01:28.340 --> 01:01:37.220]   No, the one I'm going to choose this week is a thing called Plex at www.plexapp.com.
[01:01:37.220 --> 01:01:39.220]   This is a very interesting product, actually.
[01:01:39.220 --> 01:01:44.940]   It's based on the old Xbox media center, or Xbox media player, which was an open source
[01:01:44.940 --> 01:01:49.500]   development for going way back now to the original Xbox that turned your Xbox into a
[01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:50.900]   media center.
[01:01:50.900 --> 01:01:56.220]   And there's now, it's forked, and there is now an OS 10 version called Plex.
[01:01:56.220 --> 01:02:03.740]   Careful when you say, when the liver puddly and say it's forked, I don't want to say
[01:02:03.740 --> 01:02:05.140]   anything, but just be careful.
[01:02:05.140 --> 01:02:06.140]   I'm saying that.
[01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:07.140]   Okay.
[01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:08.140]   I would say it again.
[01:02:08.140 --> 01:02:12.180]   But yeah, it's, it's from the original release.
[01:02:12.180 --> 01:02:17.020]   No, yeah, because there, because I remember reading in Life Hacker, the, the first article
[01:02:17.020 --> 01:02:21.460]   saying use Xbox media center on the Mac, and then there have been some additional like
[01:02:21.460 --> 01:02:22.900]   forks, so to speak.
[01:02:22.900 --> 01:02:23.900]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:02:23.900 --> 01:02:24.900]   Yeah.
[01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:25.900]   So it's absolutely gorgeous.
[01:02:25.900 --> 01:02:26.900]   It's really nice.
[01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:27.900]   So best one.
[01:02:27.900 --> 01:02:29.660]   I know we have the, it seems to be used from what I've seen.
[01:02:29.660 --> 01:02:30.660]   Yeah.
[01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:31.660]   It's still very early days.
[01:02:31.660 --> 01:02:34.820]   I mean, they've only been working on it for, I think, four or five months, and it's currently
[01:02:34.820 --> 01:02:35.820]   released.
[01:02:35.820 --> 01:02:39.580]   But if you check out the, I've actually downloaded it and just run it on my Mac and it looks absolutely
[01:02:39.580 --> 01:02:40.580]   fantastic.
[01:02:40.580 --> 01:02:45.020]   But I know a lot of people are using the Mac mini as an alternative to the Apple TV.
[01:02:45.020 --> 01:02:46.020]   Right.
[01:02:46.020 --> 01:02:48.940]   Because it's the, you can do other things with the Mac mini, but if you're looking for a
[01:02:48.940 --> 01:02:53.300]   good media center to run on OS 10, if you have a dedicated Mac mini connected to your
[01:02:53.300 --> 01:02:55.540]   TV, it's well worth checking out.
[01:02:55.540 --> 01:02:57.460]   As I say, it's still in its early days.
[01:02:57.460 --> 01:02:58.460]   Yeah.
[01:02:58.460 --> 01:02:59.460]   I think it is.
[01:02:59.460 --> 01:03:03.260]   I think it is out of, out of beta or out of beta, whichever you prefer, but well worth
[01:03:03.260 --> 01:03:04.260]   checking out.
[01:03:04.260 --> 01:03:07.980]   And that's Plex media center for OS 10.
[01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:10.220]   And it requires leopard.
[01:03:10.220 --> 01:03:11.220]   It does require leopard.
[01:03:11.220 --> 01:03:12.220]   Yeah.
[01:03:12.220 --> 01:03:13.220]   Yeah.
[01:03:13.220 --> 01:03:14.220]   Intel leopard only.
[01:03:14.220 --> 01:03:15.220]   Yeah.
[01:03:15.220 --> 01:03:23.260]   I have a mini attached to my HD TV and I'm using the really excellent Elgato high def connector
[01:03:23.260 --> 01:03:24.260]   for that.
[01:03:24.260 --> 01:03:25.260]   And it's great.
[01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:26.260]   I'm able to watch TV.
[01:03:26.260 --> 01:03:28.900]   I have the computer, but I'd love to look for a good media center for this.
[01:03:28.900 --> 01:03:29.900]   Does it?
[01:03:29.900 --> 01:03:33.220]   Do you, you, this is instead of front row and lieu of front row, right?
[01:03:33.220 --> 01:03:34.220]   Yes.
[01:03:34.220 --> 01:03:35.220]   Yeah.
[01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:37.220]   It's completely standalone application that has its own media management.
[01:03:37.220 --> 01:03:39.180]   I had some library built in.
[01:03:39.180 --> 01:03:42.020]   It goes away and gets metadata from various sources.
[01:03:42.020 --> 01:03:43.020]   I see.
[01:03:43.020 --> 01:03:44.020]   I love them.
[01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:45.020]   I see the TV, yeah.
[01:03:45.020 --> 01:03:46.020]   Yeah.
[01:03:46.020 --> 01:03:47.020]   It's got support.
[01:03:47.020 --> 01:03:50.740]   Well, I'm just reading from the website now support for fan art subtitle support.
[01:03:50.740 --> 01:03:52.900]   Basically everything you need within a media center.
[01:03:52.900 --> 01:03:54.740]   Yeah, it looks really nice.
[01:03:54.740 --> 01:03:55.740]   Very cool.
[01:03:55.740 --> 01:03:58.740]   I'm going to download it and it's free, which is nice.
[01:03:58.740 --> 01:03:59.740]   It's free.
[01:03:59.740 --> 01:04:00.740]   Yeah.
[01:04:00.740 --> 01:04:01.740]   Yeah.
[01:04:01.740 --> 01:04:02.740]   That's Plex app.com.
[01:04:02.740 --> 01:04:06.820]   Bob, you got a pick for us or am I going to do you want to take a pass?
[01:04:06.820 --> 01:04:10.460]   I mean, I'm sure you've had it before, but I'm just looking at the Plex thing.
[01:04:10.460 --> 01:04:11.460]   Really nice.
[01:04:11.460 --> 01:04:12.460]   Yeah.
[01:04:12.460 --> 01:04:16.580]   Because I have a projector and a screen and which is all good.
[01:04:16.580 --> 01:04:20.420]   And the one, you know, and I've been playing like DVDs off of laptop.
[01:04:20.420 --> 01:04:21.420]   It's just really rubbish.
[01:04:21.420 --> 01:04:22.740]   And I haven't made them.
[01:04:22.740 --> 01:04:24.500]   I need to make another step.
[01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:25.500]   Right.
[01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:27.340]   I've got all the wires.
[01:04:27.340 --> 01:04:31.420]   But anyway, no, the only thing I was going to do, which is because it's a little software
[01:04:31.420 --> 01:04:35.500]   app that I use all the time is Twinkle, which I'm sure people have.
[01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:36.500]   I don't think we have.
[01:04:36.500 --> 01:04:39.420]   It's an iPhone app for Twitter and I agree with you.
[01:04:39.420 --> 01:04:40.420]   I love it.
[01:04:40.420 --> 01:04:41.420]   Yeah.
[01:04:41.420 --> 01:04:42.420]   And it's so good.
[01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:48.420]   It actually works better than when I go to Twitter.com on the browser.
[01:04:48.420 --> 01:04:49.420]   Right.
[01:04:49.420 --> 01:04:50.420]   You know, it's much.
[01:04:50.420 --> 01:04:52.420]   I don't know what it is.
[01:04:52.420 --> 01:04:55.420]   It's the thing I'm using far too much.
[01:04:55.420 --> 01:04:56.420]   I've got to stop.
[01:04:56.420 --> 01:04:58.060]   You know what I like about Twinkle?
[01:04:58.060 --> 01:05:01.700]   And I think all of the Twitter clients eventually will do this because I noticed Twitterific
[01:05:01.700 --> 01:05:02.700]   is at it.
[01:05:02.700 --> 01:05:04.100]   It's location aware as well.
[01:05:04.100 --> 01:05:07.540]   So you could say when you were traveling, did you use that?
[01:05:07.540 --> 01:05:08.540]   I did.
[01:05:08.540 --> 01:05:12.180]   And it told me and it told me, you know, I can look back to it and see where I was.
[01:05:12.180 --> 01:05:13.180]   Because I can't remember.
[01:05:13.180 --> 01:05:16.740]   But it was, you know, it's fairly accurate.
[01:05:16.740 --> 01:05:20.500]   Sometimes it's a town behind, you know, working in Bristol a lot.
[01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:22.020]   And I've done a Twitter from London.
[01:05:22.020 --> 01:05:23.020]   It says, I'm in Bristol.
[01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:24.620]   But, you know, it's not that bad.
[01:05:24.620 --> 01:05:25.620]   Then it catches up.
[01:05:25.620 --> 01:05:28.220]   It's like slower than I am.
[01:05:28.220 --> 01:05:30.260]   Twinkle, it's a town behind.
[01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:31.260]   That's an issue.
[01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:32.260]   Yeah.
[01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:33.260]   What town behind?
[01:05:33.260 --> 01:05:34.260]   Twinkle is great.
[01:05:34.260 --> 01:05:35.860]   It's on the iPhone store.
[01:05:35.860 --> 01:05:38.580]   I use all the iPhone apps, but I have to say it.
[01:05:38.580 --> 01:05:40.060]   Twinkle has some really nice features.
[01:05:40.060 --> 01:05:41.260]   I agree with you on that.
[01:05:41.260 --> 01:05:43.460]   How was that fan con that you went to?
[01:05:43.460 --> 01:05:45.660]   You went to, you were at the Atlanta.
[01:05:45.660 --> 01:05:46.660]   It was extraordinary.
[01:05:46.660 --> 01:05:47.660]   No, it was great.
[01:05:47.660 --> 01:05:48.660]   It was really good fun.
[01:05:48.660 --> 01:05:55.180]   And some extraordinary, truly extraordinary people there from, from, in the sense that
[01:05:55.180 --> 01:05:59.220]   there was people I wouldn't have expected to see there in, in the sense of they were
[01:05:59.220 --> 01:06:02.180]   a lot of very amazingly bright people.
[01:06:02.180 --> 01:06:03.180]   There was a site.
[01:06:03.180 --> 01:06:04.180]   It was a science conference.
[01:06:04.180 --> 01:06:08.620]   There was discussions going on about creationism and, and evolution.
[01:06:08.620 --> 01:06:10.580]   And, you know, as well as science fiction.
[01:06:10.580 --> 01:06:11.580]   It was huge.
[01:06:11.580 --> 01:06:13.180]   I think of 67,000 people.
[01:06:13.180 --> 01:06:14.180]   Dragon con.
[01:06:14.180 --> 01:06:16.380]   It was the biggest, yeah, the biggest.
[01:06:16.380 --> 01:06:20.540]   And, and, and, did you have a Crichton booth or were you just kind of.
[01:06:20.540 --> 01:06:22.140]   I had a little, I had a little table.
[01:06:22.140 --> 01:06:23.140]   Is your really?
[01:06:23.140 --> 01:06:24.140]   Yeah.
[01:06:24.140 --> 01:06:26.740]   I was next to, I was next to Mickey Dillens from the monkeys.
[01:06:26.740 --> 01:06:27.740]   The monkeys, yeah.
[01:06:27.740 --> 01:06:28.740]   Yeah.
[01:06:28.740 --> 01:06:29.740]   The guy in the hat.
[01:06:29.740 --> 01:06:30.740]   So I was, I was, yeah, exactly.
[01:06:30.740 --> 01:06:34.500]   I spent four days standing next to Mickey Ray on the shot.
[01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:36.420]   Now, how does that work?
[01:06:36.420 --> 01:06:39.900]   Do you, I mean, do people just line up and say, Oh, Crichton, I love you and you sign
[01:06:39.900 --> 01:06:40.900]   an autograph.
[01:06:40.900 --> 01:06:41.900]   Yeah.
[01:06:41.900 --> 01:06:42.900]   Yeah.
[01:06:42.900 --> 01:06:43.900]   Do you charge, do you charge for the autograph?
[01:06:43.900 --> 01:06:44.900]   Yeah.
[01:06:44.900 --> 01:06:45.900]   I was cheap.
[01:06:45.900 --> 01:06:46.900]   You know, I found out afterwards.
[01:06:46.900 --> 01:06:47.900]   I was really cheap.
[01:06:47.900 --> 01:06:49.900]   I'm quite a big Q because people just saw there's a bargain over there.
[01:06:49.900 --> 01:06:51.900]   He doesn't know how much we were charging.
[01:06:51.900 --> 01:06:52.900]   Yeah.
[01:06:52.900 --> 01:06:53.900]   Twenty dollars.
[01:06:53.900 --> 01:06:54.900]   Twenty dollars is cheap.
[01:06:54.900 --> 01:06:55.900]   Yeah.
[01:06:55.900 --> 01:06:58.900]   How much was Mickey charging?
[01:06:58.900 --> 01:06:59.900]   Forty.
[01:06:59.900 --> 01:07:00.900]   Forty dollars?
[01:07:00.900 --> 01:07:02.900]   No, I didn't go to the Crichton.
[01:07:02.900 --> 01:07:03.900]   No.
[01:07:03.900 --> 01:07:07.900]   I think he signed his drum, he signed him drumsticks and they were, they were 65.
[01:07:07.900 --> 01:07:11.900]   Well, he did, he tested the map before he came to you.
[01:07:11.900 --> 01:07:12.900]   He played a little riff.
[01:07:12.900 --> 01:07:16.900]   Now, now Randall Schwartz, our floss weekly guy was a dragon kind.
[01:07:16.900 --> 01:07:18.900]   He was going to try to hook up with you.
[01:07:18.900 --> 01:07:19.900]   Did you run?
[01:07:19.900 --> 01:07:20.900]   I would have said no, I didn't see him.
[01:07:20.900 --> 01:07:21.900]   No, I would have been trying.
[01:07:21.900 --> 01:07:25.900]   He would have been the guy with a lampshade on his head doing the karaoke thing.
[01:07:25.900 --> 01:07:26.900]   Right.
[01:07:26.900 --> 01:07:27.900]   He likes to party.
[01:07:27.900 --> 01:07:29.900]   There were some, there were some very interesting costumes.
[01:07:29.900 --> 01:07:34.900]   I mean, from the, from what he sort of, you know, the kind of cliche of a science fiction
[01:07:34.900 --> 01:07:36.900]   you'd imagine what you'd expect of that.
[01:07:36.900 --> 01:07:37.900]   But also they were beautiful.
[01:07:37.900 --> 01:07:39.900]   I mean, two bookies walked into the room.
[01:07:39.900 --> 01:07:41.900]   They were being eight foot six tall.
[01:07:41.900 --> 01:07:44.900]   So the guys on Stilts, but so well done.
[01:07:44.900 --> 01:07:45.900]   Wow.
[01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:46.900]   That you just, it took you now.
[01:07:46.900 --> 01:07:49.900]   And I've never seen anything that well made on a film set.
[01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:50.900]   Wow.
[01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:52.900]   They were beautifully made costumes.
[01:07:52.900 --> 01:07:57.900]   And then the occasional sort of Elfen Princess who, you know, maybe someone should have had
[01:07:57.900 --> 01:08:00.900]   a word that said you're not really the princess type.
[01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:01.900]   No.
[01:08:01.900 --> 01:08:05.900]   But then there was, then suddenly through the door, right in front of me came an Elfen Princess.
[01:08:05.900 --> 01:08:09.900]   I was in love with her immediately, the most stunningly beautiful girl with the most realistic,
[01:08:09.900 --> 01:08:11.900]   prosthetic pointy ears I've ever seen.
[01:08:11.900 --> 01:08:13.900]   And she had very little on.
[01:08:13.900 --> 01:08:16.900]   If she really cared, she'd have the year job done and they'd be real.
[01:08:16.900 --> 01:08:17.900]   Yes.
[01:08:17.900 --> 01:08:18.900]   I think she should have.
[01:08:18.900 --> 01:08:19.900]   Well, it, maybe she had.
[01:08:19.900 --> 01:08:20.900]   Maybe they were really as they look real.
[01:08:20.900 --> 01:08:21.900]   You see?
[01:08:21.900 --> 01:08:22.900]   They could do that.
[01:08:22.900 --> 01:08:23.900]   I have fun.
[01:08:23.900 --> 01:08:24.900]   Yeah.
[01:08:24.900 --> 01:08:25.900]   I would love to go to that sometime.
[01:08:25.900 --> 01:08:26.900]   But I'd be a tourist.
[01:08:26.900 --> 01:08:27.900]   It is magic.
[01:08:27.900 --> 01:08:28.900]   It is absolutely amazing.
[01:08:28.900 --> 01:08:29.900]   Yeah.
[01:08:29.900 --> 01:08:32.900]   Now I wanted to be a tourist because I didn't see very much in our so busy all the time.
[01:08:32.900 --> 01:08:33.900]   Right.
[01:08:33.900 --> 01:08:36.900]   I could probably get a couple of bucks in my graph.
[01:08:36.900 --> 01:08:37.900]   I don't know.
[01:08:37.900 --> 01:08:40.900]   I'll buy three.
[01:08:40.900 --> 01:08:41.900]   Chris.
[01:08:41.900 --> 01:08:45.900]   Chris Breen, what's your Mac break weekly pick of the week?
[01:08:45.900 --> 01:08:47.900]   I have an expensive one.
[01:08:47.900 --> 01:08:48.900]   All right.
[01:08:48.900 --> 01:08:49.900]   And it's because of what happened yesterday.
[01:08:49.900 --> 01:08:55.900]   My job at the Let's Rock event was, you know, other than paying attention was to take photographs
[01:08:55.900 --> 01:08:58.900]   for the magazine and for Macworld.com.
[01:08:58.900 --> 01:09:03.900]   And so I purposely, we all purposely put ourselves in the back of the room.
[01:09:03.900 --> 01:09:08.900]   So the only thing behind us were these very large cameras that were pointed at Steve,
[01:09:08.900 --> 01:09:09.900]   the video cameras.
[01:09:09.900 --> 01:09:12.900]   And I had my Nikon D300.
[01:09:12.900 --> 01:09:17.900]   And on there I had my Nikon 70 to 300 lens.
[01:09:17.900 --> 01:09:21.900]   And as soon as I started shooting pictures, some goon from Apple comes over and says, no pictures.
[01:09:21.900 --> 01:09:24.900]   I said, well, I have no flash on here.
[01:09:24.900 --> 01:09:25.900]   No pictures.
[01:09:25.900 --> 01:09:27.900]   But there's no one behind me.
[01:09:27.900 --> 01:09:36.900]   And I had to put the Nikon on my lap with this lens on it.
[01:09:36.900 --> 01:09:40.900]   It's about the size of a tall can of 0.45.
[01:09:40.900 --> 01:09:43.900]   Is that a long lens or are you just happy to see me?
[01:09:43.900 --> 01:09:44.900]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:09:44.900 --> 01:09:47.900]   And I'm shooting from my lap between people's heads.
[01:09:47.900 --> 01:09:51.900]   And in the dark, and I have no way to tell what I'm shooting.
[01:09:51.900 --> 01:09:52.900]   Wow.
[01:09:52.900 --> 01:09:55.900]   And I've pulled in the memory card, and I'm passing them over to Jason Snow next door to
[01:09:55.900 --> 01:09:58.900]   the things during the live blogging.
[01:09:58.900 --> 01:10:01.900]   And the lens performed beautifully.
[01:10:01.900 --> 01:10:02.900]   The autofocus worked.
[01:10:02.900 --> 01:10:07.900]   I got some great shots without being able to see a thing I was doing.
[01:10:07.900 --> 01:10:14.900]   And so normally I use this for wildlife photography, but when you need to take telephoto pictures
[01:10:14.900 --> 01:10:19.900]   on the fly, because some apple harpy is about to cut your head off.
[01:10:19.900 --> 01:10:24.900]   So all of these people who are doing their live blogs were illegally taking pictures?
[01:10:24.900 --> 01:10:27.900]   Well, they have a photo well.
[01:10:27.900 --> 01:10:32.900]   So I mean, giving apple credit, they do actually have places for people doing this to do it.
[01:10:32.900 --> 01:10:37.900]   But we also needed to cover it from straight on and be able to get to a computer.
[01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:40.900]   So the photo well was not the place for us to be.
[01:10:40.900 --> 01:10:44.900]   So yes, there were people who would bring up their little point and shoots, or even their iPhones,
[01:10:44.900 --> 01:10:45.900]   and start taking pictures.
[01:10:45.900 --> 01:10:46.900]   Wow.
[01:10:46.900 --> 01:10:49.900]   And the green shirts would come over and say, "Eck, stop, stop."
[01:10:49.900 --> 01:10:50.900]   No pictures.
[01:10:50.900 --> 01:10:51.900]   They're like, "What?
[01:10:51.900 --> 01:10:52.900]   Why?
[01:10:52.900 --> 01:10:53.900]   There's no flash?
[01:10:53.900 --> 01:10:54.900]   That's ridiculous."
[01:10:54.900 --> 01:10:56.900]   Because everybody's doing it.
[01:10:56.900 --> 01:10:57.900]   Everybody was doing it.
[01:10:57.900 --> 01:10:59.900]   Well, fortunately they laid off after about 15 minutes.
[01:10:59.900 --> 01:11:03.900]   But still, from the lab shoot, this is literally from the hip shooting.
[01:11:03.900 --> 01:11:04.900]   I'm looking at them.
[01:11:04.900 --> 01:11:05.900]   They look great.
[01:11:05.900 --> 01:11:06.900]   They're really crisp.
[01:11:06.900 --> 01:11:08.900]   You know, it's tough because you're shooting.
[01:11:08.900 --> 01:11:10.900]   He's got a big bright screen behind him.
[01:11:10.900 --> 01:11:11.900]   Yeah.
[01:11:11.900 --> 01:11:13.900]   But the D300 is so good in these situations.
[01:11:13.900 --> 01:11:15.900]   I mean, it really did a great job.
[01:11:15.900 --> 01:11:19.900]   I love the picture of Steve with the radiating...
[01:11:19.900 --> 01:11:21.900]   Oh, I was 10...
[01:11:21.900 --> 01:11:22.900]   That's tough behind him.
[01:11:22.900 --> 01:11:24.900]   It looks like he's coming from heaven.
[01:11:24.900 --> 01:11:25.900]   Yeah.
[01:11:25.900 --> 01:11:27.900]   And I give credit to the lens for that.
[01:11:27.900 --> 01:11:30.900]   It really did a nice job.
[01:11:30.900 --> 01:11:34.900]   And the D300 is discreet enough not to go beep when you're about to auto-lock.
[01:11:34.900 --> 01:11:36.900]   So it worked out well.
[01:11:36.900 --> 01:11:39.900]   And that lens is not terribly expensive.
[01:11:39.900 --> 01:11:42.900]   Amazon's got it for about $485.
[01:11:42.900 --> 01:11:46.900]   It's not the crisp lens in the entire world, but $500.
[01:11:46.900 --> 01:11:47.900]   It's a darn fine-person.
[01:11:47.900 --> 01:11:49.900]   Oh, for $70 to $300, that's fantastic.
[01:11:49.900 --> 01:11:50.900]   Yeah.
[01:11:50.900 --> 01:11:51.900]   That's a great price.
[01:11:51.900 --> 01:11:55.900]   So I apologize because of course, Macworld was live blogging in.
[01:11:55.900 --> 01:11:57.900]   Here we are talking about a gadget and gizmodo.
[01:11:57.900 --> 01:11:59.900]   And I completely forgot that you guys are doing it too.
[01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:01.900]   What am I thinking?
[01:12:01.900 --> 01:12:02.900]   No, I wouldn't know.
[01:12:02.900 --> 01:12:03.900]   It's fine.
[01:12:03.900 --> 01:12:04.900]   I'm sorry.
[01:12:04.900 --> 01:12:07.900]   But the live blog is still there at Macworld.com.
[01:12:07.900 --> 01:12:12.900]   So you can see the article, including Chris Breen's pictures and recomments as well.
[01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:13.900]   That's online at Macworld.com.
[01:12:13.900 --> 01:12:16.900]   Of course, you can catch Chris's column at Mac 911.
[01:12:16.900 --> 01:12:20.900]   And every issue of Macworld magazine on Friday news stands every day.
[01:12:20.900 --> 01:12:22.900]   I think we need a jingle for Macworld magazine.
[01:12:22.900 --> 01:12:24.900]   I think we do all the way to the camera.
[01:12:24.900 --> 01:12:25.900]   It's Macworld.
[01:12:25.900 --> 01:12:26.900]   Macworld.
[01:12:26.900 --> 01:12:28.900]   Yeah, you could be doing this, Chris.
[01:12:28.900 --> 01:12:30.900]   You're such a talented musician.
[01:12:30.900 --> 01:12:32.900]   We could get some jingles out of you too.
[01:12:32.900 --> 01:12:37.900]   Well, having listened to yours, I understand that all you really need is an F major nine chord.
[01:12:37.900 --> 01:12:38.900]   Yeah.
[01:12:38.900 --> 01:12:39.900]   Over and over.
[01:12:39.900 --> 01:12:40.900]   Over and over and you've got it.
[01:12:40.900 --> 01:12:42.900]   And you overdub your voice a few times.
[01:12:42.900 --> 01:12:43.900]   Yeah.
[01:12:43.900 --> 01:12:44.900]   It's simple.
[01:12:44.900 --> 01:12:45.900]   It's kind of fun.
[01:12:45.900 --> 01:12:49.900]   I have to say we become the jingle capital of the podcast world.
[01:12:49.900 --> 01:12:50.900]   We're great jingle.
[01:12:50.900 --> 01:12:52.900]   Everything's jingleized now.
[01:12:52.900 --> 01:12:53.900]   I want to thank all you guys.
[01:12:53.900 --> 01:12:57.900]   We're also the capital of the greatest, most interesting, smartest commentators in the
[01:12:57.900 --> 01:12:58.900]   world.
[01:12:58.900 --> 01:13:00.900]   And Bob Luell and I want to thank you for joining us so much.
[01:13:00.900 --> 01:13:03.900]   What can we plug for you, Bob?
[01:13:03.900 --> 01:13:05.900]   Oh, what are you doing?
[01:13:05.900 --> 01:13:07.900]   Where's the Red Dwarf movie?
[01:13:07.900 --> 01:13:09.900]   What's the status on that?
[01:13:09.900 --> 01:13:11.900]   Well, no, it's not a movie.
[01:13:11.900 --> 01:13:12.900]   It's a Red Dwarf reunion.
[01:13:12.900 --> 01:13:18.900]   A mini-series reunion, yes, which we're still going through all the organies of organizing
[01:13:18.900 --> 01:13:19.900]   and we're going to do it in all those things.
[01:13:19.900 --> 01:13:22.900]   We're doing a press launch next Wednesday for it.
[01:13:22.900 --> 01:13:23.900]   Oh, good.
[01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:24.900]   It's sort of coming ahead.
[01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:25.900]   It's coming around.
[01:13:25.900 --> 01:13:26.900]   Oh, that's exciting.
[01:13:26.900 --> 01:13:30.900]   Because after we had you on, everybody said, "Oh, we can't wait for the reunion."
[01:13:30.900 --> 01:13:33.900]   I mean, that really was the thing everybody was looking forward to.
[01:13:33.900 --> 01:13:34.900]   Yeah.
[01:13:34.900 --> 01:13:35.900]   No, it's a big thing.
[01:13:35.900 --> 01:13:36.900]   Great to have you on again.
[01:13:36.900 --> 01:13:37.900]   Thank you very much.
[01:13:37.900 --> 01:13:38.900]   We'll make this a regular habit.
[01:13:38.900 --> 01:13:42.900]   I'm going to send you some a headset so you could type next to them.
[01:13:42.900 --> 01:13:47.900]   When I'm at home, I've got a proper stuff, headphones and a proper mic and stuff like that.
[01:13:47.900 --> 01:13:48.900]   I'm going to turn it to your flat.
[01:13:48.900 --> 01:13:49.900]   I know it as well.
[01:13:49.900 --> 01:13:50.900]   I'm going to finish.
[01:13:50.900 --> 01:13:53.900]   I'm going to do a big empty box.
[01:13:53.900 --> 01:13:55.300]   That's what it sounds like.
[01:13:55.300 --> 01:13:58.900]   It sounds like you're in, I don't know where, you know, an empty room.
[01:13:58.900 --> 01:14:02.540]   Anyway, so the rest of it here anyway, as I apologize.
[01:14:02.540 --> 01:14:03.540]   Not at all.
[01:14:03.540 --> 01:14:05.660]   It's about three in the morning for you and I really appreciate you staying up.
[01:14:05.660 --> 01:14:06.740]   Same with Don McAllister.
[01:14:06.740 --> 01:14:11.300]   It's great to talk to you of ScreenCastsOnline.com.
[01:14:11.300 --> 01:14:14.700]   And you know, I'll tell you what, this was a great show.
[01:14:14.700 --> 01:14:16.180]   We hope to be back with some regulars.
[01:14:16.180 --> 01:14:18.860]   But if not, I'm just scrubbing these people off the album art and we're going to replace
[01:14:18.860 --> 01:14:19.860]   them with you guys.
[01:14:19.860 --> 01:14:21.100]   Get rid of all those.
[01:14:21.100 --> 01:14:23.220]   Who needs those other guys?
[01:14:23.220 --> 01:14:24.980]   Another Mac break is broke.
[01:14:24.980 --> 01:14:34.980]   [MUSIC]
