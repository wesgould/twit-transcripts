[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.520]   All the way from Rwanda.
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.560]   Hello, hello.
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.440]   Gosh, you look good.
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.880]   Even a Rwanda, you look good.
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.640]   Do you just carry like a length of fiber optic cable
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:09.880]   with you everywhere you go?
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.680]   It's a very long one and it's really hard to get
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.720]   through security and get into the plane.
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:14.520]   You know, they're like, you know,
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.400]   this is going to be a drag on the plane.
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.080]   I'm like, you know, I got to do what I got to do, you know, so.
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.440]   It was fun.
[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.600]   I got to follow your trip to Kilgolly via your Instagram.
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.240]   You decided to kind of blog it as you go.
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:31.160]   Yeah, I'm taking, I usually can't talk about most of what I do.
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.280]   So when I'm actually traveling to Africa,
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.560]   I usually can take pictures of everything.
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.160]   So it's all, it's like my little vacation
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.200]   from what I normally do every day.
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.680]   So, and so I am testing out a camera.
[00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.960]   So I'm, so all those photos are from the, the DX01.
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.080]   Oh, you have the DX01?
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.720]   OK.
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:50.280]   Yeah.
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.000]   Yeah, I'm testing it.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.720]   So Trey Radcliffe had that with him,
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:53.920]   but he couldn't talk about it.
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.720]   He was ND8 or something.
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.280]   But yeah, so it looks about the size of a GoPro.
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.000]   Yep, yep.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.720]   And it's, I don't have it right in front of me.
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.080]   Is it an extreme sports camera or is it something else?
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:11.080]   No, no, it's, it makes your, makes your iPhone like a SLR.
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.520]   Wait a minute.
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:14.720]   It needs an iPhone?
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.040]   Anyway, we'll talk about it probably.
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.520]   It sounds like you're a pick of the week.
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.040]   Later.
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.800]   No, I'm not going to talk about it today.
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.520]   I can just say that I'm playing with it.
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.520]   I can't talk much more about it.
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.520]   Can you even show it?
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.520]   You would or anything.
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.280]   I'm not going to show it too much, but people can look at the results on Facebook.
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.920]   And I can show it later.
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:30.560]   But--
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.040]   So it doesn't have an interface.
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.280]   It's just Bluetooth thing to your, the pictures to your phone.
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.680]   It's a hardware interface.
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.080]   So it's lightning.
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.040]   So it's much faster connection.
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.040]   OK.
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.800]   So it really turns your phone into a, into a viewfinder and a controller.
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.680]   And, and it's, it's pretty slick.
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.840]   So anyway, so I'm, but I'm testing right now, taking lots of photos in, you know, so all
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.320]   the stuff on Facebook is me testing the camera.
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.680]   And, and I'm also sharing what I do down here.
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:59.680]   Oh, it's Facebook?
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:00.680]   Is that where you're posting that?
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:01.680]   Yeah.
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.680]   Yeah.
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.680]   Just throwing those on Facebook.
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.960]   And by the way, they have a whole website devoted to it.
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.080]   So it's not like you're, you know, you're talking out of school here.
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.080]   I mean.
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.080]   No, no, no, no.
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.920]   I, I, yeah, I know I can talk about it a little bit.
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.800]   I just don't want to get too far into it until it's.
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:15.800]   Yeah.
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:16.880]   Until a little further down the path.
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.680]   But it's, yeah, you should, people should check it out.
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:24.480]   It's, it's a, I'm the side, whether it's a pick of the week and a little bit, but, but
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.360]   it's a, it's definitely worth checking out.
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.800]   It's the most interesting camera that I've seen in a long time.
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:31.800]   DXO1.
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.000]   And let me just, it's only 600 bucks.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.160]   That's not too bad.
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.960]   And it includes, it includes film, which is nice.
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:39.960]   All right.
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:40.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:41.960]   Yep.
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:42.960]   Yep.
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:43.960]   Leather at case.
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:44.720]   Leather at case.
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:45.720]   Yeah.
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:51.360]   So it's a, the, but you know, if people want to see what that looks, the end results look
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.360]   like.
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.080]   That's what I'm kind of playing with down here.
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:00.280]   Apparently just by going there to DXO1 camera was headed to my shot.
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.280]   Wow.
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.280]   One click.
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.280]   Hey, there he is.
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:09.000]   Andy and I go the Chicago Sun times joining us from Boston.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.040]   So we've got Rwanda.
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.440]   We've got Boston.
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.280]   Nice to see you, Andrew.
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.600]   As always, this is you too.
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:23.040]   People keep asking me as if I'm your editor when you're going to file your Mac book review.
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.040]   It's been up for a while.
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.040]   Good.
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.040]   Excuse me.
[00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.040]   It's been in for a while.
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.040]   We'll be in for a while.
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.040]   Oh, we will see it soon.
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.040]   No doubt.
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.040]   We will see it soon.
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.560]   If nothing else, I'll post it on my blog.
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.360]   I'll release it as an audio book.
[00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.480]   And also with us from more.
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:43.480]   Or as some people say, Montreal, Renee Richie of i'more.com.
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:44.480]   Is it Montreal?
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.960]   I mean, I guess it depends on how you speak.
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.680]   If you're one of the Francophones here is Malaya.
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.800]   If you're one of the Anglophones, maybe it's Montreal.
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.000]   But not Montreal.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   Montreal.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   Montreal.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   M-U-N-T-R-E-A-L.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Montreal.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.400]   It's Boise, Idaho, instead of Bois.
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.240]   I have no idea.
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.240]   I live in Zeboz.
[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.680]   Actually, it's Boise.
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:04.680]   Boise.
[00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.640]   Everybody says Boise.
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:07.640]   They're all.
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:08.640]   It's Boise.
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:09.640]   It's Boise.
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:10.640]   Are you from Boise?
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.440]   I am from Boise.
[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.720]   If you said from Boise to me, I think you were kind of strange.
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:16.920]   Of Boise, Idaho.
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.720]   That's how you say it.
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.720]   Everybody outside of Idaho says Boise.
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.720]   It's Boise, but it's Boise.
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:24.720]   Boise.
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:25.720]   I didn't know that.
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:26.720]   I know it's Nevada.
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.720]   I mean, Nevada, Nevada.
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:32.040]   Do you say Missouri?
[00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.520]   I always feel a little pretentious when I say Missouri.
[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:35.520]   You feel from Missouri?
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:39.080]   I don't seem to say Missouri, so I don't know anymore.
[00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.000]   I give a talking Kansas city.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   And that was my first question.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.160]   Is it Missouri or Missouri?
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.240]   And that was it for about seven minutes of debate discussion.
[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.240]   They don't even agree.
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.240]   Is it Quebec or Quebec?
[00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.720]   I mean, we can't even put it in the rabbit's face.
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:52.720]   Well, I know it's not Quebec.
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:53.720]   I know that.
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.480]   So many tourists with so many Quebeces.
[00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:58.920]   But we're not here to talk semantics.
[00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:01.680]   We're here to talk mecha ha ha.
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.000]   And let's see.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.920]   There is mecha ha ha news, mostly rumor news, unfortunately, because we're heading into
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:13.960]   the silly season, John Patchkowski, who has moved over to BuzzFeed, but is still doing
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:20.720]   his excellent apple coverage says the fall iPhone event will be on a Wednesday, the
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:24.160]   ninth of September.
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:28.160]   Now he, if you read a little farther into it, I just really want to know if we're going
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.240]   to get oompa loompas.
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.800]   That's a little bit.
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:31.800]   That's all a picture.
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.320]   I think that would be a really great addition to a.
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.440]   That is the best apple loompas.
[00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:45.360]   The credit on that photo on John's article is BuzzFeed Warner Brothers sources.
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:50.480]   This is the actual quote, despite the headline sources familiar with apples plans tell BuzzFeed
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:53.120]   news, the AKA John Patchkowski.
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:57.640]   The company intends to hold a special event the week of September 7th with Wednesday, the
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:00.880]   ninth being the most likely date.
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:03.880]   But doesn't Apple always have these on Tuesday?
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:04.880]   It's not always.
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:06.320]   I mean, they've had events on Thursday.
[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:09.480]   The week, as far as I know, the week has been set forever.
[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:10.800]   It's almost like WWE DC now.
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:14.360]   It's like just unless Apple changes that it's the second week in September for the event
[00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:18.840]   and the third week of September for the launch, whether it's a Tuesday or a Wednesday and
[00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:21.600]   the iPad stuff, I think, were the most interesting things in John's people.
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:22.600]   Yeah.
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:27.400]   So he says the iPad Pro seems to be a wild card still for September.
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:30.920]   And also, I think that the most likely reason that it's moved out is also to have a week
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:33.720]   date to set up before after Labor Day.
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:34.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:35.720]   Labor Day is the assist.
[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:40.040]   It pushes it out to not be expensive to work on that day.
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:41.200]   Right.
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:47.760]   We are, according to this article, expecting an iPhone with force touch, an improved camera
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:53.280]   system and a significantly faster and more powerful wireless chip or power efficient
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:54.440]   wireless chip.
[00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:56.640]   And I'm really interested to see if they're going to go to a 4k camera.
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:59.840]   I mean, a lot of the cameras have been, you know, a lot of the some of the smartphones
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:01.280]   are starting to come up with that.
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:06.400]   And especially if the new Apple TV, you know, or if they have an Apple TV that has 4k, it
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.320]   seems like you'd want to be able to shoot images with your phone that would end up,
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:12.800]   you know, video on your phone that would end up on properly on your on your app.
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.520]   Do you like the mobile 4k cameras?
[00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:15.520]   Yeah, Alex.
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:16.520]   Sorry.
[00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:18.560]   Do you like the mobile 4k cameras?
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:19.800]   Like the Android phones that have 4k?
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:20.800]   Do you have you tried them?
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.280]   I have not tried them.
[00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:23.800]   I don't have a reference for it.
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:27.040]   Sam's saying for the first couple of generations of its phones.
[00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:28.040]   Yes.
[00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:31.480]   I think that if Apple were to do something like that, I don't think it'd be so much as shooting
[00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:36.280]   4k video so much as giving you editing and camera move options when you put it into
[00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:41.240]   iMovie or even on the mobile end, the ability to sort of recompose and reframe it without
[00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:44.960]   having to have without the ability to have a digital zoom inside the phone itself.
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:45.960]   Yeah.
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:50.080]   And I think that I think that if I was going to give up light sensitivity for resolution,
[00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:52.920]   I'd rather have I still rather have more light sensitivity.
[00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:57.880]   You know, so they stayed where they were at 1080p and made it better at night.
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:59.320]   I'd be happy with that.
[00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:03.960]   What's the relationship between megapixels and light sensitivity?
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:06.880]   Well the photo sites on the chip, it depends on how big the chip is.
[00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:11.920]   I mean, you can have a chip that has great low light that is that it also has a great
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:17.680]   resolution, but it's how big those photo sites are and really the signal to noise ratio
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.440]   on those photo sites.
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:24.120]   And so in how much orata it occurs, the smaller that that photo site is.
[00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:27.920]   And I mean, like basically what's creating that pixel, each one of those, the smaller
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:31.720]   that is the less sensitive it's going to be, the more grain you're going to get because
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:35.320]   it's basically gaining up to get that low light information.
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:40.200]   So larger chips tend to be better in low light especially now.
[00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:43.600]   Are they making a big deal about the size of their pixels for the last couple of years?
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:44.600]   Right.
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:49.800]   Submicron pixels are less light sensitive.
[00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:56.080]   Yeah, and so during the day and sunlight, you're just going to get a great image that
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:57.440]   is very high resolution.
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:00.360]   But most of us are shooting a lot of stuff.
[00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:03.720]   We're shooting birthday parties and we're shooting our dinners and we're shooting things
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:09.080]   with friends in the evening and all of those things are things that you want to have better
[00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:10.080]   light sensitivity.
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:13.720]   That's why you're, you know, you have all that motion blur because it's trying to lower
[00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:17.680]   the frame rate or lower the shutter speed so that you get enough light in there to properly
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:18.840]   expose it.
[00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:20.640]   And so you're ending up with a lot of blurry images.
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:22.440]   Yeah, it's 1.5 right now.
[00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:24.840]   One and a half microns.
[00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:29.320]   It's hard to compare the two though and see it in the last year or two, it's been harder
[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:35.640]   for me to see the advantage of the lower megapixel count on iPhones as I get to compare them with
[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:42.240]   like something like the Galaxy S6 where you can sort of see where I guess the iPhone 6
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:45.920]   and the 6 Plus did a better job with the color.
[00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:50.120]   Maybe there's a little bit more detail in the shadows, but it's at this point, it's
[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:54.600]   not something that you can't correct with just touching a slider a little bit.
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:59.120]   And between those two models of phones specifically, I'd much rather have the increased megapixel
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:03.360]   count so that like I said, you can you can crop in to have a much, much better higher
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:06.920]   resolution, excuse me, a much better photo with a much tighter clock crop than you could
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:07.920]   with eight megapixels.
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:11.640]   Eight is starting to look like not whole that you can do with it.
[00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:14.080]   Yeah, the rumors for 12 this year, I think.
[00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:15.080]   Yeah.
[00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:17.360]   12 megapixels on e-sensor.
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:21.240]   I think what we're really learning is that it's the software, not the hardware that makes
[00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:24.000]   the difference, certainly in the Apple cameras.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   Is there chipset?
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.140]   They've had, which is one of the other interesting things because we should get the next generation
[00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:31.680]   of Apple chipset and they've been making their own silicon now for three or four years.
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:34.840]   They had Swift and then Cyclone this year it was typhoon.
[00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:36.920]   So maybe it's tropical storm or hurricane next year.
[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:43.880]   So you're saying the AA and the new presumably nine would have something in them, some secret
[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:45.720]   sauce that makes pictures better.
[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:49.680]   They have that's been Apple's big deal because unlike Nokia they don't, they don't put giant
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:52.080]   Carl Zeiss lenses into capture really good light unlike Google.
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:54.400]   They don't upload things to the server and auto awesome them.
[00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:58.360]   So they try to do all their magic inside the image signal processor and every, every event
[00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:02.160]   they have, Phil Schiller spends a good five minutes talking about the image signal processor.
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:07.400]   And that's what does things like the intelligent burst mode and all the auto white balancing
[00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:09.600]   and auto focusing that they do in the camera app.
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:13.480]   Almost all of it is done on chip for them and they put a lot of power behind that chip.
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:16.240]   So maybe they don't capture the best light and maybe they don't do anything with that
[00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:19.800]   server side, but they try to get you the best, what they call the best everyday picture out
[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:20.800]   of the shots you take.
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.800]   Well, it certainly succeeds.
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:29.280]   Then it would explain why Apple hasn't been really playing the pixel in the pixel race,
[00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:30.280]   the megapixel race.
[00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:33.960]   But that isn't the interesting thing about the photography in the past couple of years.
[00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:39.480]   Sigraph is going on this week and Google had their presentation, which they're showing
[00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:43.640]   off different technologies that once again underscore the their point of view is that
[00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:48.640]   if you use the or I think it's even more than Google, you have a camera that is interpreted
[00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:53.200]   as a capture device that the whole point of it is to simply collect as much data as possible
[00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:57.080]   so that another piece of software either on the phone or on a server on a desktop can
[00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:59.560]   then build whatever picture that person wants.
[00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:03.920]   They showed off a feature where if you move the if you move your phone a little bit for
[00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:07.480]   the left and the right, when you're taking a sequence of pictures, it can do things like
[00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:12.280]   figure out that if you're shooting through a window, it could remove everything that is
[00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:16.520]   in the window and not and leave a clear picture behind it.
[00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:19.560]   So in the end, it really comes down to results.
[00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:24.200]   People want to tap a button, get a picture and think that's an awesome photo, whether
[00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:28.800]   they get it because they attacked attached to $600 doohickey to the side of their phone
[00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:32.320]   with an actual good lens and an actual good image sensor or whether you go through the
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:37.200]   Apple approach, which is to put this amazing image processor inside the device or whether
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:42.400]   you use Google's approach, which is to say we can even take a cheap $200 camera by the
[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:47.360]   time it goes up to the server, then back down to the user, it's going to be pretty awesome.
[00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:50.320]   It's interesting to see which one which are these three approaches is going to be the
[00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:54.360]   most relevant for people who in the in the end, let's admit it are just posting stuff
[00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:55.360]   to Facebook and Instagram.
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:59.400]   So if I went out and bought the DX01, which connects to my iPhone via Thunderbolt, would
[00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:02.800]   I get the benefit of the image processing chip?
[00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:03.800]   No.
[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:05.440]   No, it's got its own image process.
[00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:06.440]   It has its own.
[00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:07.440]   It makes their own processors.
[00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:11.000]   In fact, they make the processors for almost for a lot of people.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   Well, and that's the other thing is Apple is using the same lens hardware as other people.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:23.480]   They among others, Sony, although does Apple kind of customize the camera's lens before
[00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:24.480]   they put it in?
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:29.960]   They buy the sensors, but I believe they have the things like the lenses actually are made
[00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:30.960]   in house.
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:34.600]   So the sensors are in common with other cameras, but that's just the sensor.
[00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:38.040]   Yeah, but I believe again, it's the chips that where they put most of their time and focus
[00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:41.560]   on the camera's stuff.
[00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:45.880]   By the way, one of the rumors and this comes from the fairly credible source, Evleaks,
[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:48.560]   is that there won't be one or two, but three iPhones.
[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:50.120]   This is so silly.
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:51.120]   You don't believe this?
[00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:52.400]   No, I thought that I don't believe it.
[00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:56.440]   It's that all these news sources go and post, he just puts up a quick tweet saying, sounds
[00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:59.600]   like the iPhone's like, first of all, every iPhone has always arrived concurrently.
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:04.240]   I don't believe there's ever been a year where Apple released iPhones more than once.
[00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:06.560]   The debate is whether it's going to be an iPhone 6C or not.
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:10.320]   Some people says it won't be because it hasn't leaked, but the iPod touch with the new processor
[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:11.320]   didn't leak.
[00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:13.800]   So if you just change the processor and a few other things, it's easy not to have it
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:14.800]   leak.
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:19.320]   So the debate around this, I find, is a little bit incredulous.
[00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:26.200]   6S plus, that would be the logical successor to last year's phones.
[00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:29.680]   6C, it's been a while since they made a C. They made the 5C.
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:30.680]   They never made a 6C.
[00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:32.000]   It solves a problem for them.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.840]   So the reason they made the 5C is because the original 5 was going to go down the minus
[00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:39.800]   $100 phone and the 5S was going to come up on top of it, but there's very little visual
[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:43.560]   distinguishing, very little to visually distinguish those phones.
[00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:48.000]   So if you go into a store and you see a 5 and you see a 5S, the 5s looks really good
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   enough.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.200]   So you can see the 5C touch ID.
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:54.600]   And then Apple's average selling price goes down, which is one of the most important things
[00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:56.600]   from the average selling price of phones.
[00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:59.400]   So and also the iPhone 5 is hard to manufacture.
[00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:02.480]   It's a more difficult manufacturer because it has those chamfered edges and things.
[00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:07.600]   So the iPhone 5C, it let them test out ideas like colored iPhones, plastic cases, but also
[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:09.280]   made it very visually different.
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:12.000]   You knew you didn't have the flagship phone.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:17.080]   So this year, if the iPhone 6 goes down, the minus $100 phone and the iPhone 6S is on
[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:21.040]   top of it again, maybe people don't care about force touch or the better camera.
[00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:24.640]   And it makes it easier for them to buy the lower price phone, even if you do reduce the
[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:27.120]   memory or do some other things with it.
[00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:31.080]   So it behooves Apple in general to make sure that their flagship phone is always visually
[00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:35.480]   distinct and sort of otherwise makes let's people know that they that you have the high
[00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:42.480]   end iPhone and that's where the the C line sort of works for them.
[00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:45.760]   So this year it would make sense for them to have a C phone as well because it would
[00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:52.200]   stop them having an iPhone 6 at a minus $100 price point.
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:55.640]   And then the other thing that I thought was interesting is the rumor that all of the stuff
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:18:01.140]   will be announced the same day, the same month, not a September phone launch in October,
[00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:06.560]   a iPad launch, but patch caske implies it'll all be on in that September, the first week
[00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:07.560]   in September.
[00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:11.360]   See iPads are like the iPad mini will get smaller and it'll get a better chip and the
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:13.600]   iPad Air will get a better chip, but that's not startling.
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:18.080]   Those almost procedural updates at this point and whether you can linchpin an event because
[00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:21.760]   for the last two years has been iPad and Mac events in October.
[00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:25.080]   But if it's just really we have it's not even touch ID to add to them anymore.
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:27.000]   And force touch may not be ready for iPad.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.760]   So you have very little to say other than this is a speed bump.
[00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:33.680]   So if they want to clear sort of clear room for an iPad pro or some other device, you
[00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:35.960]   get the iPhones, the iPads and the Apple TV.
[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:36.960]   That makes sense.
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:40.480]   So there might be an October iPad pro announcement along and I wouldn't be surprised to see
[00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:45.120]   new Macs based on the new Intel chip, which is just starting to come out.
[00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:46.120]   Right.
[00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:47.120]   The.
[00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:48.840]   And the remote rumored 4K.
[00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:50.840]   I'm a skylake.
[00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:51.840]   Sky.
[00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:52.840]   Skylake.
[00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:53.840]   Skylake.
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:57.840]   Which has much better battery life and more more power, more performance.
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:01.080]   Yeah, the talk update, the architecture improvement.
[00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:02.080]   Yeah.
[00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:05.720]   For desktop is arguable how much difference that makes, but it's still a better architecture
[00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:07.200]   for desktop anyway.
[00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:09.480]   And mobile should make a big difference because of the battery life.
[00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:10.480]   Yeah.
[00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:14.640]   So that's a good question because they released updates for the Mac book is already on Broadwell.
[00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:16.600]   The 13 inch MacBook Pro is on Broadwell.
[00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:18.360]   The Mac book airs around Broadwell.
[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:22.000]   The 50 inch got bumped to a newer version of Haswell, Haswell 1.5, whatever you want
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.560]   to call it, but it hasn't gone to Broadwell yet.
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:26.760]   So do they re revamp the Mac books?
[00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:28.000]   They're very popular computers.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   It's early, but on the other hand, it might be a time to do it.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   Super interesting.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   Super interesting yearly.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.240]   Oh, because usually things were going to point where we could predict them fairly accurately.
[00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:39.840]   And now there's a bunch of wild cars moving around.
[00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:45.120]   What show, when would they show that at the September event?
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:51.800]   I think it would be concurrently with iOS 9 when I'm thinking they're going to want
[00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:56.880]   to make a big deal out of it because I'm and I'm, you tell me I'm wrong.
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:01.320]   I think the watch is not selling very well or not as well as they'd hoped.
[00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:06.160]   And arguably a flop, but watch to watch.
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:11.440]   iOS 2.0 could bring it back with the ability for it to run standalone apps and that might
[00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:13.320]   they might want to make a big deal about that.
[00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:14.320]   No, you disagree?
[00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:18.040]   No, it's not arguably a flop.
[00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:22.360]   As we said once or twice before, when Apple has a flop, that's what that's what that's
[00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:24.000]   what HTC would love to have.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.800]   And that's what Motorola would love to have a flop of that magnitude.
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:33.480]   No, I still think of it in terms of trying to get trying to get a lunar module into space.
[00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:34.480]   There's the first stage.
[00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:37.640]   We just let up the first stage, the second stage gets you to the moon.
[00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:40.800]   I think that the Apple watch is in orbit right now.
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:44.960]   And when apps come, that's what it turns into an actual lunar exploration vessel.
[00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:48.800]   It's not as much as what it will be once the ecosystem is a little bit better for it.
[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:52.480]   This is people often I say flop, but I actually think it is a flop.
[00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:54.080]   Well, how do you find flop?
[00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:57.200]   Flop as in a category that is not going anywhere.
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:58.200]   No.
[00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:03.480]   I mean, I think they've only sold as many as...
[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:07.480]   Actually, I'm not considering sales because I don't care about sales.
[00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:08.480]   I'm...
[00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:10.400]   I think that all...
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:16.440]   I've actually trended downward my expectations of what Apple would have to do to make a success
[00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:20.600]   of this or what really any other company has to do to make a success of a watch.
[00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:22.640]   All it has to do is be a cool watch.
[00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:25.520]   And Apple has definitely made a cool watch that people really want to buy.
[00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:30.840]   And they've also demonstrated that they can at least sell it in volume enough that to justify
[00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:33.160]   keeping on selling it.
[00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:38.320]   So whether or not it will ever become ubiquitous in the way that you can't enter into any public
[00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:43.200]   place without seeing Apple logos on phones and laptops, that remains to be seen.
[00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:46.680]   But I think they've demonstrated they can produce a successful smartwatch.
[00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:49.320]   Well, maybe it's a successful smartwatch.
[00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:52.360]   I still think the category is a flop.
[00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:53.360]   We had it before.
[00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:56.360]   In other words, everything you're saying is relative to others, but I think the category
[00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:57.360]   itself is a flop.
[00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:58.360]   I don't think...
[00:21:58.360 --> 00:21:59.360]   Well, I mean, I don't think you want it.
[00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:00.760]   I don't think anybody wants it.
[00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:02.160]   I see you wearing one.
[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:03.160]   I don't know.
[00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:05.480]   I have to say that I wasn't sure.
[00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:07.320]   I wasn't sure whether I'd want one.
[00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:08.320]   But I like it or not.
[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:10.960]   I actually took a lot of time to go ahead and buy one.
[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:15.080]   And so I really like my old watch.
[00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:17.920]   But I don't think I could go back.
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:18.920]   Really?
[00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:19.920]   So you still wear it.
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:20.920]   See, I stopped wearing it.
[00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:21.920]   It's like...
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:23.880]   It's just a noise to me at this point.
[00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:26.880]   It's telling me to stand up at 10 minutes.
[00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:27.880]   I do.
[00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:30.920]   For me, the standing up thing makes me a little crazy, especially when it doesn't realize
[00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:32.840]   that I'm in bed in Kigali.
[00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:38.560]   But just beeping and buzzing and drooping for no purpose all the time.
[00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:43.760]   For me, being able to stay in contact and look down and get texts and slack and those
[00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:45.320]   types of things and being able to look...
[00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:46.640]   I want to be a little bit more interactive.
[00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:50.920]   I want to be able to answer slack, that kind of thing.
[00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:54.840]   And being able to really clearly have my time zones and all the things that I do, I have
[00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:59.320]   to admit that I don't think I could go back to a regular watch at this point.
[00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:01.000]   I mean, there's a lot of things I don't like about it.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:07.840]   I mean, I don't like the way that the complex, what do they call them, complexions or whatever.
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:09.640]   The center one, you don't have enough control.
[00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:12.480]   You can't do with the center one what you can do with all the rest of them.
[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:15.440]   I don't like the fact that it's buzzing in the middle of the night.
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:19.480]   There's a bunch of things that I still think is too slow when you turn up and you have to
[00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:20.480]   be just the right angle.
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:23.720]   So there's this whole like when you're laying down and you look over and you can't get
[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:24.720]   your watch to turn on.
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:25.720]   So...
[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:26.720]   So...
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:27.720]   So...
[00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:28.720]   So...
[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:30.420]   was that I'm not saying, I guess what I'm saying
[00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:31.500]   is they're not-- - You're not selling me
[00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:33.120]   on the watch, if I'm sitting listening to this going,
[00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:34.260]   oh I gotta get that.
[00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:36.180]   - Sure, but I mean, it's not to similar conversations
[00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:37.620]   to what we had when the iPhone came out
[00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:40.280]   and the iPad came out, and you right before the Apple Watch
[00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:41.100]   came out. - I disagree,
[00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:43.760]   I thought the iPhone was a hit from Day One.
[00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:46.740]   I knew it was flawed, but I saw that it's utility.
[00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:48.300]   I didn't think the Watch, I don't think
[00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:50.260]   normal people are gonna ever buy that thing.
[00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:52.160]   - I guess I know you seem certain that--
[00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:55.380]   - What it does do, what it does do and how it integrates,
[00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:57.300]   though, is even with all the things that I complain
[00:23:57.300 --> 00:23:59.300]   about around it, and I complain about a lot of things,
[00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:01.700]   but all things that I complain about around it,
[00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:03.420]   I still wouldn't go back to a regular watch.
[00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:05.460]   I mean, I think that's the, for me, at least,
[00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:07.300]   my experience of it, I just don't wanna,
[00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:09.100]   I just love the fact that I don't pull out my phone
[00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:10.580]   every time it buzzes, I can just look down and say,
[00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:12.020]   "Oh, I don't wanna pay attention to that," or, "I do,"
[00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:13.580]   or whatever.
[00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:15.780]   - One of the things that we found interesting was,
[00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:17.420]   I always thought it was gonna be like an Apple TV
[00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:19.820]   because you had to have other Apple stuff in order to use it,
[00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:21.340]   but I mean, some expectations were like,
[00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:22.540]   it was gonna be the next iPhone,
[00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:24.980]   and there is, that's just an impossible expectation for me.
[00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:26.300]   - Of course.
[00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:28.300]   - Yeah, but I do think it's performing,
[00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:29.540]   I think it has surprised some people,
[00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:31.780]   we're running a survey that actually ends today on iMore
[00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:33.500]   about how people use their Apple watch.
[00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:34.580]   It's not whether you have it or not,
[00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:35.420]   but if you have it,
[00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:37.420]   how much do you actually use all the different features?
[00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:39.100]   And it's about an eight to 10 minute survey,
[00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:41.460]   and we've had about, I don't know, six, 7,000 people
[00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:44.020]   take it already, and it's super interesting to see
[00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:46.260]   how many people use it in how many ways,
[00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:48.500]   and while some people might find absolutely no use for it
[00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:49.580]   or might find it annoying,
[00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:51.540]   there is a large contingent of people
[00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:54.380]   within the confines of those who already have an iPhone 5
[00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:56.580]   or more and actually want health features
[00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:58.100]   or notification features or whatnot,
[00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:00.260]   but they are getting considerable value out of it.
[00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:02.900]   And my interest is mostly, I agree with Andy,
[00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:05.380]   we're gonna see a watch OS 2 around the time of iOS 9.
[00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:06.940]   I'm wondering if they're gonna do something else
[00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:07.780]   over the holidays,
[00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:08.940]   like if there's gonna be new bands
[00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:10.660]   or something else that's gonna further
[00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:12.660]   sort of create buzz around the product,
[00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:15.940]   because it's too soon for a new actual watch module,
[00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:17.540]   but it might not be too soon given their model
[00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:19.660]   to have red bands or new leather bands
[00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:21.180]   or new metal bands or something else
[00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:24.300]   to sort of make the watch seem fresh again for the holidays.
[00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:25.140]   - I'm gonna make a comment.
[00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:25.980]   - I think as I was pissing people off,
[00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:28.060]   I'm also gonna say the iPad is history.
[00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:30.500]   (laughing)
[00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:31.340]   - No?
[00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:32.180]   - And the Mac.
[00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:34.020]   - No, the Mac, thank God they still make it.
[00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:35.860]   I don't know how much longer they will.
[00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:37.780]   - Leo, you jumped off the cliff,
[00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:39.460]   why bother flapping your arms at this point?
[00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:41.060]   (laughing)
[00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:42.260]   - No, I like the Mac.
[00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:44.100]   I think the Mac has some legs,
[00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:46.300]   not enough to keep apple afloat, but it has some legs.
[00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:49.220]   But I do think that it's interesting to see
[00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:52.700]   that these, the two most recent categories, Apple,
[00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:54.180]   has announced have,
[00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:56.220]   and that's the problem is you do compare them to the iPhone,
[00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:59.820]   which is kind of unprecedented success,
[00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:01.180]   historic success.
[00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:02.860]   - Even the Salsa fuel resources don't compete well
[00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:03.700]   with the other ones.
[00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:05.660]   - Yeah, I know, excellent, not doing so well.
[00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:08.140]   - And I do think that there would be a surge.
[00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:12.500]   I strongly, I am, after last show,
[00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:16.620]   I bought a Mac, I listened to Andy and--
[00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:18.060]   - Love that Mac, though, do you like it?
[00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:20.020]   - Yeah, I love it a lot.
[00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:22.460]   The only thing that I don't like is that I can't
[00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:23.660]   touch the screen.
[00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:26.340]   You know, and I think that, you know,
[00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:28.460]   like I don't need them to figure out how to touch the screen.
[00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:31.220]   Just let me touch it, like with my Surface 3,
[00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:33.300]   I don't have any problem with just moving things around
[00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:35.060]   and touching as much, and then when I need to go back
[00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:37.060]   to a trackpad, I go back to it, it would be fine.
[00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:39.380]   So it's a little frustrating there.
[00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:43.380]   But outside of that, the, it's great, it's light,
[00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:44.300]   it's easy to use. - What do you think
[00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:45.140]   of force and touch?
[00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:46.700]   Does that ring your chimes?
[00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:50.140]   - On the trackpad, I thought it was kind of amazing.
[00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:51.700]   I mean, I still keep on touching it.
[00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:52.540]   - What are you doing with it?
[00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:54.700]   - I don't know, no, no, no, force touch.
[00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:58.340]   Not the fact that there's no moving parts.
[00:26:58.340 --> 00:26:59.180]   - Force touch?
[00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:00.020]   - Force click.
[00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:01.020]   - Oh, the force touch I'm not using.
[00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:01.860]   I'm not really using this.
[00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:03.140]   - Yeah, I have found a use for that now.
[00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:07.180]   There was an interesting rumor that came out.
[00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:10.220]   Who was it, was quoting people who used the,
[00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:12.980]   who are using the new iPhone with force touch?
[00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:13.820]   - Mark Gurman.
[00:27:13.820 --> 00:27:15.340]   - It was Mark Gurman, of course.
[00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:16.180]   - Yeah.
[00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:17.420]   - Who said that the people who are using it
[00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:21.120]   are finding wonderful, new, exciting ways to use it.
[00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:23.820]   It makes sense in the watch because you just have
[00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:25.660]   a dearth of controls.
[00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:27.300]   I don't have, I haven't found a way to use it.
[00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:29.100]   - Look at the music app, we'll give all those
[00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:30.260]   incessant more buttons,
[00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:32.060]   all those lips and more buttons.
[00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:33.660]   And all this functionality is buried.
[00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:35.380]   And again, if you get angry, you just hit something
[00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:37.140]   and then all this functionality pops up at you.
[00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:38.940]   And if it tracks your finger and if it gives you stuff
[00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:40.500]   like precious sensitivity without the need
[00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:42.100]   for a Wacom layer in between,
[00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:43.460]   then there's a, like, you just,
[00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:44.700]   you don't have to keep your time.
[00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:45.620]   - It's not intuitive to me.
[00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:47.900]   I guess when you're drawing, it makes sense.
[00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:49.620]   But just in other contexts, it's not intuitive.
[00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:51.220]   Like I wanna, it gets in the way sometimes.
[00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:53.900]   I wanna drag an icon in my dock around
[00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:55.220]   and then accidentally force touch
[00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:57.180]   and now it's doing something else.
[00:27:57.180 --> 00:27:58.900]   - Yeah, I mean, it's gonna take a while to get used to it.
[00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:01.060]   But it is a way of putting things that aren't vital
[00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:03.500]   to your usage of an app, but would be nice to have,
[00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:05.860]   much more conveniently than having to go to some submenu
[00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:08.700]   or some separate entire screen to access them.
[00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:09.700]   - Yeah.
[00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:12.020]   One answer to that is that make it simpler
[00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:14.860]   so that you don't need to have that sort of interactivity.
[00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:17.820]   But, and I know I talked about this a lot
[00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:20.300]   last week of the week before, but I just think that
[00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:22.460]   Apple shouldn't mess with it unless they can present
[00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:26.300]   a consistent definition of what force touch means.
[00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:29.660]   I don't think they've done that on either the trackpad
[00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:30.500]   or the watch yet.
[00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:33.100]   - One thing Apple has?
[00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:35.860]   - It's like saying, imagine that there's a gesture
[00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:37.540]   that is like this.
[00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:41.020]   That match, literally, imagine like that
[00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:42.260]   with the botch and with the phone.
[00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:44.860]   Said, well, occasionally if you do this,
[00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:46.860]   then this other interface comes up like,
[00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:49.540]   okay, why would I wanna try to do that?
[00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:50.780]   - Well, actually we're starting to get those.
[00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:53.300]   There's the shakier interface, right?
[00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:55.740]   And then there's some Android device like this,
[00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:56.940]   Android device, the Moto G.
[00:28:56.940 --> 00:28:58.580]   If you go like this, you take a picture.
[00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:00.140]   - Well, remember a shake to shuffle in music?
[00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:01.540]   And every time you dance, you change a song,
[00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:02.500]   you were dancing too.
[00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:03.900]   - People have tried stuff like that.
[00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:06.180]   Yeah, it doesn't work with dancing, I guess.
[00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:08.540]   - Yeah, we just think that one too.
[00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:10.460]   - One thing Apple has changed is their website.
[00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:11.460]   Big change to the website.
[00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:12.920]   The store is gone.
[00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:14.980]   But Apple--
[00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:18.260]   - And it's both, it's gone and it's everywhere.
[00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:19.900]   - It's gone Obi-Wan.
[00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:21.020]   If you strike me down now,
[00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:22.900]   and I'm more powerfully and you possibly imagine.
[00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:24.540]   - But what do they take down now before an event?
[00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:25.900]   Like, does a whole site come down now
[00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:27.060]   for two hours before an event?
[00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:28.860]   - Well, I think the point is now is it?
[00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:30.540]   (laughing)
[00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:32.300]   - You're right.
[00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:33.540]   I never even thought of that
[00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:35.220]   'cause traditionally the store says,
[00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:37.140]   we're closed, come back in a minute
[00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:38.260]   when we have a new product.
[00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:39.660]   But now the store is, as you say,
[00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:41.540]   fully integrated into the site.
[00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:42.780]   So, and this makes sense.
[00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:43.780]   - It may make it easier.
[00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:46.020]   It may make it easier because you don't have to turn it,
[00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:48.240]   you know, but this may be a much bigger engineering project
[00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:49.900]   where now they don't have to necessarily--
[00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:51.780]   - Now that just take away the buy button, right?
[00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:53.780]   - There's no web object URLs if you look through there.
[00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:55.500]   - Oh really, they finally abandoned it.
[00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:56.340]   That's really--
[00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:57.360]   - I don't know if I don't see any.
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:58.640]   - Oh, that would be nice.
[00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:00.880]   Poor, I feel so bad for the Apple website, guys,
[00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:05.740]   who had to use web objects long after everybody had abandoned it.
[00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:08.300]   So, the buy button is the change now.
[00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:13.300]   So, you go to any product as one would to do research.
[00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:16.660]   And instead of then going to the store to buy,
[00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:18.680]   you can buy right there.
[00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:21.000]   In fact, here we are already in a buy interface
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.840]   just by clicking the iPad.
[00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:25.640]   So, I guess that, yeah, it makes sense.
[00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:28.680]   It was a little, one thing was hard for me to do,
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:29.880]   and maybe that's an unusual thing,
[00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:31.620]   but people often ask me,
[00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:34.720]   what's the difference, let's say a MacBook Air
[00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:36.560]   and a MacBook Pro?
[00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:38.240]   And it used to be you'd go to the store
[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:41.360]   and it was a lot easier to look at the specs and the numbers.
[00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:43.560]   Now you have to kind of go to different sections
[00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:45.640]   of the website to see them.
[00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:48.220]   There is a compare button, so I guess you can
[00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:50.520]   eventually get a comparison going, right?
[00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:53.660]   - I have to admit, my favorite aspect of this
[00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:55.340]   is on the mobile version, there's a hamburger
[00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:57.240]   without a patty, and if you click on it,
[00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:59.260]   it spins around, it turns into an animated X
[00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:00.900]   and then spins back and goes out of the way.
[00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:03.260]   - What's a hamburger with, you mean a two-line hamburger?
[00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:04.580]   - Yeah, two-line hamburger.
[00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:05.740]   Some people have called it a falafel.
[00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:07.060]   I mean, I don't know what it's supposed to represent,
[00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:08.260]   but it's really nicely animated.
[00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:09.940]   - It's a taco, everybody knows it's a taco.
[00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:10.780]   - A taco.
[00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:12.380]   - It's a taco button, a T-E-I-C-O button.
[00:31:12.380 --> 00:31:13.820]   - It's a T-E-I-C-O.
[00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:16.160]   So this is, you know, it's funny,
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:18.640]   I don't think it's widely noted,
[00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:20.520]   but somebody who's pays attention,
[00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:21.960]   lately paying attention to web design
[00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:23.280]   'cause of our own redesign.
[00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:26.880]   I find this fascinating that they just eliminated the store.
[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:28.400]   It's just there.
[00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:30.080]   - It's a good move.
[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:33.160]   - I think my definition has to be a good move
[00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:36.040]   because you have to imagine exactly how much play testing
[00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:39.880]   Apple did and how much sensors they had wired up
[00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:41.040]   into the site.
[00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:43.640]   God knows how long they've been running this version
[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:45.180]   of the standard Apple store site
[00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:46.900]   that was wired to simply watch.
[00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:49.020]   How do people move through our site
[00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:52.160]   and what moves end with them purchasing something?
[00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:53.060]   So I--
[00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:54.700]   - They have the metrics, you right, yeah.
[00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:57.540]   - They have the metrics and they, again, ABC,
[00:31:57.540 --> 00:31:58.380]   always be closing.
[00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:01.220]   Never put the buy button more than like 10,
[00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:03.860]   more than four neuron jumps away from--
[00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:04.700]   - That makes sense.
[00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:06.500]   - The Skinner box reaction.
[00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:09.780]   - And to answer your hypothetical, right?
[00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:13.500]   I guess if you just, you know, here I am on the 5K iMac
[00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:15.340]   and all you do is just make that buy button
[00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:16.180]   just goes away.
[00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:17.260]   - It's almost less dramatic though.
[00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:20.260]   - I know, you lose some of the event feeling of it, right?
[00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:21.100]   It's gonna be new.
[00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:22.780]   - The best thing about this to me is that
[00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:24.180]   'cause we've been talking about iTunes
[00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:26.860]   and things like that for several shows
[00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:28.940]   and apple.com is an incredibly popular site
[00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:31.360]   and it had a backend powered by what might not be
[00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:33.180]   considered current web technology.
[00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:35.320]   And then all of a sudden, like a snap of their fingers,
[00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:37.460]   they changed it and they were probably working on it
[00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:39.440]   behind the scenes for a very long time
[00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:41.300]   and it has to make you hope that they're working
[00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:43.020]   on something similar for the iTunes store
[00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:45.540]   because that's a huge sort of technical debt
[00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:46.820]   that they're carrying behind them
[00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:48.900]   and one of the reasons why iTunes is the way it is.
[00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:51.620]   And if they're doing a similar restructuring there,
[00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:53.420]   maybe at some point we'll just, we'll come there
[00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:54.860]   and we'll see something new and wonderful
[00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:56.620]   at one of these events that they've been building
[00:32:56.620 --> 00:32:58.140]   behind the scenes for a couple of years.
[00:32:58.140 --> 00:33:02.220]   - Have you assigned a, I'm more reported to look
[00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:03.820]   at the source code behind the page
[00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:06.540]   and figure out what it is they're doing now?
[00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:09.100]   - They're just using what looks like
[00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:11.300]   really smart implementations of modern web standards.
[00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:12.620]   - It does, doesn't it?
[00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:13.660]   - Yeah.
[00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:14.660]   - Interesting.
[00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:16.420]   - And it is one of the most popular sites on the web.
[00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:18.420]   So like Andy said, you don't change those lightly.
[00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:19.260]   - Yeah.
[00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:22.660]   It's kind of beautiful if you go to,
[00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:25.340]   you know, as an example, go to the 5K
[00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:28.780]   and, you know, the 5K IMAX page
[00:33:28.780 --> 00:33:30.380]   and then as you scroll, you figure out
[00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:31.540]   I've got to scroll down, right?
[00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:33.660]   'Cause as you scroll down, look what happens.
[00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:36.740]   Instead of scrolling down, the giant image you're looking
[00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:41.740]   at recedes into an IMAX and then it scrolls down.
[00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:44.020]   - That's kind of beautiful unless it's your job
[00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:45.980]   to cover Apple and you've got to look at it over and over
[00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:47.260]   and over and over and it takes you three seconds.
[00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:48.100]   - Are you sick of it?
[00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:49.100]   (laughing)
[00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:51.140]   - No, and then I understand that it's not built for me.
[00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:53.740]   So I can perspective take on it, but like it is beautiful.
[00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:54.580]   It just takes a while.
[00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:56.220]   - I think you nailed it, always be selling.
[00:33:56.220 --> 00:33:57.500]   That's exactly what it is, Andy.
[00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:01.540]   This is everything here is a pitch for the product.
[00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:04.380]   - And it's quite a mix of both simplicity and complexity.
[00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:06.340]   I mean, I just find that going through it,
[00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:07.580]   you don't feel like you're being,
[00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:08.980]   you have a lot of stuff being thrown at you,
[00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:10.860]   but they are packing a lot of options
[00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:12.180]   and everything else into it.
[00:34:12.180 --> 00:34:15.140]   Like everything else, I mean, it's a good lesson
[00:34:15.140 --> 00:34:17.820]   in how to think through things visually.
[00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:19.740]   - They must have been testing this for years.
[00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:21.980]   I mean, this is Geez Louise.
[00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:24.620]   - But also notice that even the stuff that's important,
[00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:26.140]   I mean, this is just terrific design.
[00:34:26.140 --> 00:34:27.460]   The stuff that's important is also,
[00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:29.460]   they still have that deck of buttons up the top
[00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:32.860]   so that I don't want the beautiful sales brochure
[00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:33.700]   presentation.
[00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:35.020]   I just want to see a table that tells me
[00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:36.980]   how much RAM is in this thing.
[00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:40.260]   You can still scroll up and there's the tech specs
[00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:41.260]   still the top deck.
[00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:44.900]   - Oh, they look, they're doing that taco thing here too,
[00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:48.540]   Renee, when you click the grid, the X rotates and then--
[00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:49.380]   - Ooh.
[00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:50.220]   - It's a very smooth animation
[00:34:50.220 --> 00:34:52.420]   and very consistently smooth across the web.
[00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:53.860]   - You know what, that tells me
[00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:56.380]   they're preloading hundreds of megabytes of stuff
[00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:57.940]   behind the scenes.
[00:34:57.940 --> 00:34:59.820]   - They used to do that for the animations
[00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:02.180]   on an older version where they would do JPEG slicing
[00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:03.340]   before web animation.
[00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:04.180]   - Right, remember that?
[00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:05.620]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:09.420]   Now, okay, little nitpick, sometimes the button says buy,
[00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:11.420]   sometimes it says buy now.
[00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:12.780]   - You're Amy testing.
[00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:13.780]   - You think?
[00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:14.620]   I don't know.
[00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:15.540]   - You're right.
[00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:17.500]   If do they sell more when it says buy now?
[00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:19.380]   Good, we'll say buy now from now on.
[00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:23.340]   Let's take a break, we'll come back with more.
[00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:24.180]   I'll take it back.
[00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:25.460]   I love the watch and the iPad.
[00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:27.260]   They're gonna be big, big sellers.
[00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:28.820]   I'm so sorry.
[00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:30.340]   - That's gonna be that, it's gonna be the audition.
[00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:31.700]   - I was just cranky.
[00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:37.540]   - Well, we'll see, we'll ask you again like a day after a week
[00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:40.980]   before the event to see, after the advice to go out to see if.
[00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:43.260]   - I know, I was getting excited at the event.
[00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:46.180]   Actually, you know what happened on the MacBook event?
[00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:48.340]   What was the line that Phil Schiller used?
[00:35:48.340 --> 00:35:50.460]   Something about lust, hashtag?
[00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:51.500]   - Hashtag Maclust.
[00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:53.820]   - Maclust, I had it.
[00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:57.020]   And then cooler heads prevailed and I didn't buy it.
[00:35:57.020 --> 00:35:58.900]   I thought, no, no, no.
[00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:00.580]   And then I saw a lot of people with them
[00:36:00.580 --> 00:36:02.980]   and I fell in love with it all over again.
[00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:05.900]   So I had to buy it and now I'm very happy.
[00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:07.660]   - Is your review positive, Vandy?
[00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:10.260]   - The new MacBook, yeah.
[00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:11.100]   - Yeah.
[00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:15.180]   - It's, it's, the basic take is that,
[00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:17.980]   a lot of you heard me talk about it with the past month here,
[00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:19.820]   that I do think it's the most advanced,
[00:36:19.820 --> 00:36:22.380]   the most exciting Mac Apple has done in years.
[00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:23.820]   It would certainly, without question,
[00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:27.460]   one of the three landmark designs they've done
[00:36:27.460 --> 00:36:29.540]   might even be the most significant since the,
[00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:30.380]   since the iMac.
[00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:31.740]   Not, definitely not for everybody.
[00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:34.460]   It'll be more, it'll be a more egalitarian design
[00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:35.740]   next year, I think.
[00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:37.740]   But this is not a failure by any means.
[00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:41.260]   This is, this is definitely building something today
[00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:43.500]   that is the platform for future Macs tomorrow.
[00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:44.420]   Really exciting.
[00:36:44.420 --> 00:36:46.780]   - Not perfect, but, but, but really impressive.
[00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:47.700]   - Not perfect for everybody.
[00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:48.540]   - Yeah.
[00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:49.380]   - They're, they're a lot of,
[00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:51.100]   I keep coming back to Douglas Adams,
[00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:53.340]   what he used to say about the, about the Concord,
[00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:56.420]   where when the super, super sonic,
[00:36:56.420 --> 00:36:58.380]   cross Atlantic flights,
[00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:00.780]   which were really only about an hour shorter
[00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:02.780]   than conventional jets.
[00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:04.620]   But they cost like $10,000 more.
[00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:09.300]   So as he said, that extra hour has to be incredibly important
[00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:11.820]   to all of the people inside that plane.
[00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:14.660]   And so when you say there are a lot of people for whom,
[00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:16.380]   I don't care that the keyboard is a little bit flatter
[00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:18.420]   for it means that I get to have a real MacBook
[00:37:18.420 --> 00:37:19.460]   that's the size of an iPad.
[00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:20.300]   So.
[00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:22.740]   - Yeah.
[00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:25.100]   Maybe that's one reason I use the iPad so much less
[00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:25.940]   than I used to.
[00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:28.780]   I kind of like having a real keyboard.
[00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:31.540]   - It's, it's not that I,
[00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:33.860]   have you, have you tried out iOS 9 yet on the iPad Air 2?
[00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:34.700]   - No.
[00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:35.540]   - Yeah.
[00:37:35.540 --> 00:37:38.260]   - It's, I mean, I've also been using Windows 10
[00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:39.540]   for the past couple of weeks a lot more
[00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:41.060]   than I use Windows normally.
[00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:44.540]   And it really makes me itch for the ability in iOS 9
[00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:46.580]   to put two apps side by side
[00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:48.460]   and be able to switch between apps
[00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:51.060]   with a mechanical keyboard really, really easily.
[00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:53.660]   And I think that above, above and beyond
[00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:55.140]   making it a larger device,
[00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:57.260]   above and beyond having a different silicon in there,
[00:37:57.260 --> 00:37:59.180]   I think it's just that Apple has done,
[00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:00.860]   if Apple just does that one thing,
[00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:02.540]   I think they could have done a couple of years ago
[00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:05.900]   very, very without, without a lot of trouble.
[00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:09.580]   They, a lot of people would have been not quite so
[00:38:09.580 --> 00:38:12.060]   enamored of MacBook Airs when they have iPads
[00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:16.500]   that can do 90% of what they want to do just as easily.
[00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:19.780]   - One of the other things rumors are strong,
[00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:22.140]   Apple will be announcing in less than a month.
[00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:23.620]   - We're gonna go to a commercial?
[00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:24.460]   - I was.
[00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:25.540]   - Okay, sorry, didn't know.
[00:38:25.540 --> 00:38:27.140]   - This is called the T's.
[00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:27.980]   - Got it, sorry.
[00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:31.900]   I don't, I don't know if I should take responsibility
[00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:34.380]   for distracting you and then you forgot to make money.
[00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:36.860]   - No, no, no, no, I won't not forget that part.
[00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:37.860]   - That is not possible.
[00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:38.860]   (laughing)
[00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:39.860]   - Can I just add this,
[00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:41.100]   - Just like a broader source,
[00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:43.660]   that's a secondary brain somewhere.
[00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:46.340]   - Oh no, that's a ditch I've got to scratch.
[00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:47.460]   Go ahead, Renee.
[00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:48.300]   - I was gonna just say,
[00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:49.700]   I've been spending the last three days deep diving
[00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:52.540]   on multitasking, multitasking on iOS 9.
[00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:53.980]   I've got it running on the iPad Air 2,
[00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:56.220]   but I've also been going over how it's implemented.
[00:38:56.220 --> 00:38:57.820]   I should have a piece up on that in a couple of days,
[00:38:57.820 --> 00:39:00.420]   but it's really, really smart.
[00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:02.860]   And it's taught me just using the iPad Air 2 all the time.
[00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:05.180]   It's amazing how big a difference it makes.
[00:39:05.180 --> 00:39:08.020]   - We shall see.
[00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:09.080]   We shall see.
[00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:13.940]   Apple TV is also gonna be announced.
[00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:15.540]   We'll talk a little bit about that.
[00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:17.580]   We've talked about that for the last few weeks.
[00:39:17.580 --> 00:39:19.660]   Let's see if there's anything new to say.
[00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:21.740]   But first a word from Wealthfront,
[00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:26.940]   a very clever solution to a very real problem.
[00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:30.540]   If you're saving, and saving is,
[00:39:30.540 --> 00:39:32.700]   I hope a big part of your financial plan,
[00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:35.460]   whether it's for retirement or buying that house
[00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:40.460]   or rainy day fund, the issue is how do you invest the money?
[00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:44.180]   I mean, do you just put it in a savings account
[00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:47.740]   and hope that one quarter of one percent's gonna grow, yeah?
[00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:49.940]   Or do you go to an investment advisor
[00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:53.260]   where he takes one to 3% of what you've got under management
[00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:55.660]   and fees for transactions and changes
[00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:58.220]   and your money goes backwards?
[00:39:58.220 --> 00:39:59.620]   Or do you try to do it yourself
[00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:01.060]   and then forget to pay attention
[00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:03.820]   and all of a sudden you're losing money?
[00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:06.060]   Here's a better way, Wealthfront.
[00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:08.620]   It makes it easy for anyone to access world class,
[00:40:08.620 --> 00:40:10.540]   long-term investment management.
[00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:15.120]   You could start today for $500, that's the minimum.
[00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:17.580]   But actually you can get an account
[00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:19.820]   at wealthfront.com/macbreak
[00:40:19.820 --> 00:40:23.460]   and see what portfolio they would be recommending for you.
[00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:25.740]   You answer a few questions about your timeframe,
[00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:27.420]   your risk aversion.
[00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:29.580]   Now, it's one of the reasons you save money,
[00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:33.180]   by the way, the cost instead of one to 3% a year
[00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:36.500]   is one quarter of one percent a year
[00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:39.740]   with no commissions and no hidden fees, that's it.
[00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:40.820]   And the reason they can do that
[00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:43.260]   is because they're using programmatic trading
[00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:45.420]   that's very sophisticated.
[00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:47.060]   In fact, we'll make you more money
[00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:49.300]   because they do things that humans aren't good at
[00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:52.460]   like tax loss, harvesting and direct indexing.
[00:40:52.460 --> 00:40:54.220]   So they're gonna optimize your returns,
[00:40:54.220 --> 00:40:55.820]   lower your tax bill,
[00:40:55.820 --> 00:40:58.940]   ultimately improve your savings.
[00:40:58.940 --> 00:40:59.900]   It's all based on, by the way,
[00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:01.220]   don't go right past those books
[00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:04.300]   'cause it's all based on a couple of books,
[00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:06.580]   a one that I read some years ago
[00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:08.020]   that was totally inspiring,
[00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:09.380]   a random walk down Wall Street
[00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:11.060]   and winning the losers game.
[00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:13.740]   These are books that talk about
[00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:16.940]   how to actually beat the market
[00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:20.300]   and the software is based on these concepts.
[00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:23.900]   Very sophisticated and it's very successful.
[00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:26.500]   They've grown 20 times in the past two years.
[00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:30.460]   They now have over $2.4 billion in assets they're managing.
[00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:31.700]   And you can try it right now,
[00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:33.540]   wealthfront.com/macbreak.

[00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:46.100]   And then if you decide to invest,
[00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:48.580]   and again, the minimum 500 bucks,

[00:41:57.540 --> 00:42:02.180]   Not even one quarter of 1%, but zero of percent
[00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:04.740]   of your first $15,000 free of charge.

[00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:11.740]   For compliance purposes,
[00:42:11.740 --> 00:42:13.460]   I have to tell you Wealthfront Incorporated
[00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:16.180]   is an SEC registered investment advisor.
[00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:17.580]   Broke Ridge services are offered
[00:42:17.580 --> 00:42:19.820]   through Wealthfront Broke Ridge Corporation,

[00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:26.220]   This is not a solicitation to buy or sell securities.
[00:42:26.220 --> 00:42:28.260]   Investing in securities involves risks
[00:42:28.260 --> 00:42:30.500]   and there is the possibility of losing money.

[00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:45.820]   Renee Ritchie is here from iMore.com.
[00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:48.220]   From Kilgolly and Pixelcore
[00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:51.860]   in beautiful downtown Rwanda, Alex Lindsey.
[00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:52.700]   Is it hot?
[00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:55.820]   - It's warm, but not any warm.
[00:42:55.820 --> 00:42:57.740]   - It's not a fan, but it's not on.
[00:42:57.740 --> 00:42:59.180]   - No, it's not.
[00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:01.700]   - It's winter, isn't it?
[00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:03.260]   It is nine o'clock.
[00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:04.420]   - Nine p.m. - It's not really
[00:43:04.420 --> 00:43:06.580]   - On a winter season. - Nine hours.
[00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:09.340]   - Yeah, but it's,
[00:43:09.340 --> 00:43:10.580]   you know, Kilgolly is kind of,
[00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:12.380]   there's dry season and there's wet season.
[00:43:12.380 --> 00:43:14.060]   There's not really summer, winter,
[00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:14.900]   you know, that type of thing.
[00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:17.340]   So the wet season's about to come,
[00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:19.700]   so it's kind of overcast and there's a nice little wind,
[00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:22.140]   so it's actually quite a nice week to visit.
[00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:25.100]   - And of course, Andy and I go from the Chicago sometimes.
[00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:28.060]   - Anything more to say about Apple TV?
[00:43:28.060 --> 00:43:29.420]   I think we talked about it last week,
[00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:31.620]   that it just, I get the impression,
[00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:33.140]   and I guess I gather you guys do too,
[00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:35.340]   that Apple just finally said, "Oh, forget it.
[00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:36.900]   "We're just gonna put the hardware out."
[00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:37.860]   - Shippet. - Shippet.
[00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:39.380]   - Shippet. (laughs)
[00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:41.260]   Great artist, Shippet.
[00:43:41.260 --> 00:43:42.700]   - Well, I think it's gonna be interesting.
[00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:44.380]   I think that I'm really interested to see
[00:43:44.380 --> 00:43:45.220]   if they're gonna open up.
[00:43:45.220 --> 00:43:47.100]   I mean, I think that we think they're gonna get apps.
[00:43:47.100 --> 00:43:49.540]   You know, I think that that's really gonna open up,
[00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:50.860]   it's a whole new market.
[00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:52.220]   I mean, really, I mean, I think that,
[00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:54.420]   you know, to be able to develop for the iPad,
[00:43:54.420 --> 00:43:57.180]   I mean, for the Apple TV,
[00:43:57.180 --> 00:43:59.700]   when you'd have all these phones that become controllers
[00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:02.060]   for games and, you know, a chip that's powerful enough
[00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:04.460]   to do it, I think that beyond the content,
[00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:06.740]   even if they haven't gotten the content deals yet,
[00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:09.660]   that they could get a lot of interest there.
[00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:11.460]   - Yeah, maybe if you have the hardware in place,
[00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:13.260]   then it's easier to make the deals.
[00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:16.180]   - Or maybe it's less scary when they can say,
[00:44:16.180 --> 00:44:18.140]   "Well, you know, I think they sold 100,000."
[00:44:18.140 --> 00:44:19.740]   What are you worried about?
[00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:21.580]   That was the come on with iTunes, wasn't it?
[00:44:21.580 --> 00:44:22.420]   - Yes. - What?
[00:44:22.420 --> 00:44:25.420]   Just the little Mac, nobody's even nerds.
[00:44:25.420 --> 00:44:27.820]   Nobody's gonna care about that.
[00:44:27.820 --> 00:44:30.740]   - I mean, again, I mean, Apple, Apple could,
[00:44:30.740 --> 00:44:33.620]   anytime they wanted to, could start going to David Fincher,
[00:44:33.620 --> 00:44:34.620]   they could go to these other guys,
[00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:36.460]   "Hey, let us give you $50 million,
[00:44:36.460 --> 00:44:37.900]   let us give you $100 million, make the movie."
[00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:38.980]   - I haven't, they've done that.
[00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:41.700]   That's what Netflix has done and Amazon has done.
[00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:43.900]   So many companies are doing their own content now.
[00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:44.980]   Why has an Apple done that?
[00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:47.500]   - You wanna video over in the Beats 1.0?
[00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:48.340]   - No.
[00:44:48.340 --> 00:44:49.900]   (laughing)
[00:44:49.900 --> 00:44:53.740]   - Well, I think that Julie adds a nougat sounds pretty hot.
[00:44:53.740 --> 00:44:56.620]   - Well, I'm gonna be streaming a video channel.
[00:44:56.620 --> 00:44:59.420]   - Yeah, actually, that's an interesting idea.
[00:44:59.420 --> 00:45:02.620]   Who would ever add video to audio programming?
[00:45:02.620 --> 00:45:04.100]   - That's nuts!
[00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:06.100]   - Oh, I'm sorry, never mind.
[00:45:06.100 --> 00:45:10.740]   - Well, I think that the, you know,
[00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:13.300]   I think part of it is, I think that with all of these things,
[00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:14.620]   there's a little bit of Apple,
[00:45:14.620 --> 00:45:18.220]   I think there has to be a concern at the size that they are
[00:45:18.220 --> 00:45:19.420]   of any kind of antitrust.
[00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:20.700]   They do a lot of these things.
[00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:23.580]   - But Amazon's huge and Amazon's making content.
[00:45:23.580 --> 00:45:26.820]   - They're the largest, it's one thing to be huge,
[00:45:26.820 --> 00:45:28.180]   it's something to be the largest company,
[00:45:28.180 --> 00:45:30.980]   the largest publicly traded company in the United States.
[00:45:30.980 --> 00:45:32.620]   - That's an interesting liability, isn't it?
[00:45:32.620 --> 00:45:36.220]   Maybe that's why Google split itself into...
[00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:37.060]   - ABC.
[00:45:37.060 --> 00:45:38.060]   - ABC.
[00:45:38.060 --> 00:45:39.220]   - Don't rate me.
[00:45:39.220 --> 00:45:40.060]   - XYZ.
[00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:44.340]   - Because to avoid that kind of scrutiny.
[00:45:44.340 --> 00:45:46.820]   - It might be the scrutiny, I think that it's also to allow
[00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:49.060]   these other ones to thrive on their own and, you know,
[00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:51.500]   not have everyone complaining that they're being distracted.
[00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:54.980]   But I think that, you know,
[00:45:54.980 --> 00:45:57.020]   I think Apple has some antitrust issues, possibly.
[00:45:57.020 --> 00:45:58.220]   I mean, that could be a concern.
[00:45:58.220 --> 00:45:59.420]   I think that, you know,
[00:45:59.420 --> 00:46:01.220]   I think that they've culturally really felt like they should
[00:46:01.220 --> 00:46:03.300]   be working with the industry that's already there.
[00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:04.300]   That's what they've always done.
[00:46:04.300 --> 00:46:06.860]   And I think Steve was very, that was his real focus.
[00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:11.220]   But I think that, again, it would be noise for them to spend
[00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:13.460]   $100 million a week on a new movie
[00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:15.260]   that was only released on iTunes.
[00:46:15.260 --> 00:46:16.100]   - Yeah.
[00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:16.940]   - You know, like it was only, you know,
[00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:19.260]   that was a great movie that is never,
[00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:22.100]   you're never gonna see it in any place other than iTunes.
[00:46:22.100 --> 00:46:22.980]   You know, I think that, you know,
[00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:23.820]   that wouldn't be hard.
[00:46:23.820 --> 00:46:25.900]   They could find great directors that aren't, you know,
[00:46:25.900 --> 00:46:28.740]   have never, have not been able to be as creative as they like,
[00:46:28.740 --> 00:46:31.420]   or whatever, is you're not walking away from Hollywood,
[00:46:31.420 --> 00:46:33.220]   you're just walking away from the system,
[00:46:33.220 --> 00:46:34.780]   the distribution partners.
[00:46:34.780 --> 00:46:36.380]   - There's other directions they could go at.
[00:46:36.380 --> 00:46:37.380]   - Go ahead, Andy.
[00:46:37.380 --> 00:46:39.580]   - Not only that, but I think that it's significant
[00:46:39.580 --> 00:46:42.180]   that Amazon does well with this,
[00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:44.100]   Amazon does well with this,
[00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:46.300]   and Netflix does well with this,
[00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:50.260]   because they are absolutely flat, generic corporations
[00:46:50.260 --> 00:46:53.980]   without a single point of view creatively on their own,
[00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:57.140]   whereas Apple is nothing but expressing their point of view
[00:46:57.140 --> 00:46:58.780]   in all the products that they ship.
[00:46:58.780 --> 00:47:02.820]   So I think that if they were to start to produce
[00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:06.060]   their own content, they couldn't do so without,
[00:47:06.060 --> 00:47:08.660]   in some way saying we endorse this approach
[00:47:08.660 --> 00:47:11.020]   to this material, or we endorse this topic,
[00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:13.060]   or we endorse this creator,
[00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:15.460]   which would so handcuff them in ways
[00:47:15.460 --> 00:47:17.180]   that their competitors don't have that I don't think
[00:47:17.180 --> 00:47:19.740]   it would be successful, but I think more important than that,
[00:47:19.740 --> 00:47:22.180]   I just think they're just not interested
[00:47:22.180 --> 00:47:23.620]   in getting in that business.
[00:47:23.620 --> 00:47:29.100]   Do you wanna have a meeting with Adam?
[00:47:29.100 --> 00:47:30.540]   (laughs)
[00:47:30.540 --> 00:47:33.100]   With the, oh God, do you wanna start
[00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:34.540]   making happy Gilmore movies?
[00:47:34.540 --> 00:47:35.700]   You would, (laughs)
[00:47:35.700 --> 00:47:37.380]   Sandler, do you wanna take that meeting?
[00:47:37.380 --> 00:47:40.460]   Do you wanna say, fine, you're a cobbler
[00:47:40.460 --> 00:47:44.060]   and makes magical shoes, fine, you're doing a racist,
[00:47:44.060 --> 00:47:47.060]   old West parody, we don't find weird use.
[00:47:47.060 --> 00:47:49.700]   I mean, and the obvious one still, I think,
[00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:52.820]   is just the, you know, and it probably will never happen,
[00:47:52.820 --> 00:47:55.380]   but is just by Disney, and let Disney continue to be Disney,
[00:47:55.380 --> 00:47:59.180]   but you know, but by Disney, and then experiment
[00:47:59.180 --> 00:48:03.220]   with their content, I mean, is the perfect platform
[00:48:03.220 --> 00:48:05.940]   for the kind of Apple stuff, but when it comes to everything
[00:48:05.940 --> 00:48:09.580]   from Marvel to Star Wars to all these other things,
[00:48:09.580 --> 00:48:12.860]   it's just a great platform for Apple, you know,
[00:48:12.860 --> 00:48:15.620]   and I think that, you know, and they could buy it with cash.
[00:48:15.620 --> 00:48:17.820]   You know, 85% of my childhood now, Alex.
[00:48:17.820 --> 00:48:21.180]   Star Wars and Disney and Amupids and Marvel.
[00:48:21.180 --> 00:48:23.180]   No, it was something, it took me a little while
[00:48:23.180 --> 00:48:25.180]   to realize that it was for sale.
[00:48:25.180 --> 00:48:29.740]   What would that do, what would deal that deal
[00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:30.740]   to creators?
[00:48:30.740 --> 00:48:33.820]   I mean, would you, let's say that you are a filmmaker,
[00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:37.540]   we either a huge filmmaker or just someone with a point of view,
[00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:40.620]   would you be happy saying that congratulations?
[00:48:40.620 --> 00:48:43.340]   We've bought your movie and it'll be only available
[00:48:43.340 --> 00:48:46.380]   to really expensive high-end luxury devices you won't be able--
[00:48:46.380 --> 00:48:48.300]   No, no, but what I'm saying is, if Apple just,
[00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:50.380]   Apple wouldn't need to do that, if Apple just bought Disney
[00:48:50.380 --> 00:48:53.380]   and then just said, we're just gonna distribute Disney stuff,
[00:48:53.380 --> 00:48:55.380]   it wouldn't, without the exclusive, you know,
[00:48:55.380 --> 00:48:57.740]   without all that work, Apple could, you know,
[00:48:57.740 --> 00:49:01.220]   just start using the Disney assets as a, you know,
[00:49:01.220 --> 00:49:03.140]   Disney, let Disney continue to do what it does,
[00:49:03.140 --> 00:49:05.140]   let Pixar continue to do what it does,
[00:49:05.140 --> 00:49:07.220]   let all of that continue to go down the path
[00:49:07.220 --> 00:49:08.340]   so that Apple doesn't have to deal
[00:49:08.340 --> 00:49:10.780]   with their branding issues against it, it's just Disney.
[00:49:10.780 --> 00:49:12.860]   But then at the same time, you know,
[00:49:12.860 --> 00:49:15.660]   do do aggressive things where you're doing better extras
[00:49:15.660 --> 00:49:18.420]   on iTunes and you're doing, you know,
[00:49:18.420 --> 00:49:20.100]   you know, more integration, you know,
[00:49:20.100 --> 00:49:22.620]   with the products and the movies.
[00:49:22.620 --> 00:49:24.660]   And there's lots of that, you know,
[00:49:24.660 --> 00:49:29.660]   and the, it's so big, I mean, that property is so big
[00:49:29.660 --> 00:49:31.460]   that, you know, Apple could chew on that
[00:49:31.460 --> 00:49:33.900]   for quite some time and put a lot of pressure
[00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:36.140]   on the other entertainment, you know,
[00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:37.900]   because they can turn it into money in places
[00:49:37.900 --> 00:49:40.500]   that a lot of the traditional distributors can't.
[00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:42.300]   We'll go out to buy Fox and Microsoft,
[00:49:42.300 --> 00:49:44.820]   have to buy Universal and be a glorious.
[00:49:44.820 --> 00:49:46.940]   (laughing)
[00:49:46.940 --> 00:49:49.020]   And, but I think you're right also about regulation,
[00:49:49.020 --> 00:49:51.140]   regulatory approval might be an issue.
[00:49:51.140 --> 00:49:53.220]   Yeah, it could be very difficult.
[00:49:53.220 --> 00:49:54.900]   I think that that's the, I personally think
[00:49:54.900 --> 00:49:56.420]   that's the number one reason they haven't bought
[00:49:56.420 --> 00:49:58.100]   one of these entertainment industries
[00:49:58.100 --> 00:50:00.380]   is why they're not doing their own content is,
[00:50:00.380 --> 00:50:02.420]   is that it's just, I think that it puts them
[00:50:02.420 --> 00:50:05.260]   in a position that I'm sure there's some concern there.
[00:50:05.260 --> 00:50:07.300]   The pressure precedent for that goes in the other direction
[00:50:07.300 --> 00:50:12.300]   was when the movie studios owned motion picture theaters,
[00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:14.620]   movie theaters.
[00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:16.700]   And in fact, that's how it all worked for years
[00:50:16.700 --> 00:50:19.860]   in the, what is it, 20s and 30s was they'd make a movie
[00:50:19.860 --> 00:50:23.060]   and then send it to their house theaters.
[00:50:23.060 --> 00:50:26.060]   And that's, I think would be similar that Apple would be
[00:50:26.060 --> 00:50:29.140]   in the reverse as the big, Apple's the theater.
[00:50:29.140 --> 00:50:31.700]   If they bought a movie company, that'd be an issue.
[00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:36.540]   But on the other hand, the Apple TV could really jumpstart
[00:50:36.540 --> 00:50:37.940]   their home kit stuff, right?
[00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:39.420]   Don't they need to do that?
[00:50:39.420 --> 00:50:40.260]   Pretty soon.
[00:50:40.260 --> 00:50:42.180]   They don't, with iOS 9, they've actually moved it to iCloud.
[00:50:42.180 --> 00:50:43.900]   So as long as you have an iCloud account,
[00:50:43.900 --> 00:50:45.980]   you can do everything you used to have to have an Apple TV for.
[00:50:45.980 --> 00:50:48.140]   But what Apple TV could do is the same thing
[00:50:48.140 --> 00:50:49.900]   that the Apple Watch does is that sort of make it better.
[00:50:49.900 --> 00:50:51.340]   So you could have, for example,
[00:50:51.340 --> 00:50:53.460]   a very Amazon Echo style Siri presence
[00:50:53.460 --> 00:50:54.780]   in your living room with the Apple TV.
[00:50:54.780 --> 00:50:56.540]   So you could, without having to go to your watch
[00:50:56.540 --> 00:50:58.500]   or your phone, if it's just not convenient or not with you,
[00:50:58.500 --> 00:51:02.580]   you could just say, yo, Siri, game mode,
[00:51:02.580 --> 00:51:03.660]   and then all the lights would change
[00:51:03.660 --> 00:51:05.700]   and the music would come up and the video game would start
[00:51:05.700 --> 00:51:07.420]   and that adds extra value to it.
[00:51:07.420 --> 00:51:11.700]   - We're seeing Microsoft add Cortana capabilities
[00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:13.500]   to Xbox, they've announced that.
[00:51:13.500 --> 00:51:18.380]   Would it, should the Apple TV respond to voice?
[00:51:18.380 --> 00:51:20.260]   - Yeah.
[00:51:20.260 --> 00:51:23.740]   - I think, I think, go ahead, Eddie.
[00:51:23.740 --> 00:51:25.420]   - Good, quickly, it's a huge thing.
[00:51:25.420 --> 00:51:28.180]   Once you simply can just raise your head,
[00:51:28.180 --> 00:51:30.060]   make a request, get information,
[00:51:30.060 --> 00:51:32.540]   and get information back or do stuff,
[00:51:32.540 --> 00:51:35.380]   you realize that if I could have Amazon Echo
[00:51:35.380 --> 00:51:36.900]   in every single room, I would like to have Echo
[00:51:36.900 --> 00:51:37.740]   in every room.
[00:51:37.740 --> 00:51:40.420]   If I could have a $99 box made by Apple,
[00:51:40.420 --> 00:51:42.940]   that even I would just use it in a headless fashion,
[00:51:42.940 --> 00:51:45.300]   just making sure there is one in almost every room
[00:51:45.300 --> 00:51:47.980]   where I tend to hang out, if it just had that feature,
[00:51:47.980 --> 00:51:50.620]   I would definitely buy three or four of them.
[00:51:50.620 --> 00:51:52.740]   It's like multi-touch, it really--
[00:51:52.740 --> 00:51:53.900]   - Well, it's like the Echo, right?
[00:51:53.900 --> 00:51:55.740]   I mean, I would put up with the Echo in every room,
[00:51:55.740 --> 00:51:56.900]   if I could.
[00:51:56.900 --> 00:51:59.020]   - Have you an Echo that sold internationally?
[00:51:59.020 --> 00:52:00.260]   - Ah, sorry.
[00:52:00.260 --> 00:52:02.980]   Bad news.
[00:52:02.980 --> 00:52:07.020]   - It's like Renee is always there with a little auger drill.
[00:52:07.020 --> 00:52:09.020]   Every time there's a boat floating about a feature
[00:52:09.020 --> 00:52:10.660]   that someone else has, that's truly,
[00:52:10.660 --> 00:52:12.620]   oh, it's not available and kind of a whole room.
[00:52:12.620 --> 00:52:14.780]   - It's a rain cloud over my head.
[00:52:14.780 --> 00:52:16.020]   - It's an advantage to Apple.
[00:52:16.020 --> 00:52:17.220]   Google's doing a great job with this now,
[00:52:17.220 --> 00:52:18.740]   and so is Microsoft, but it's an advantage
[00:52:18.740 --> 00:52:20.860]   when you can provide the similar services to people
[00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:22.540]   in a wide variety of countries.
[00:52:22.540 --> 00:52:23.940]   It becomes more valuable to everybody.
[00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:25.340]   - And it's a bigger challenge too.
[00:52:25.340 --> 00:52:27.620]   I can't imagine how difficult it would be
[00:52:27.620 --> 00:52:30.900]   to internationalize voice system like that.
[00:52:30.900 --> 00:52:33.540]   I mean, it's almost like Amazon is one of the few companies
[00:52:33.540 --> 00:52:35.820]   that has the license to do that
[00:52:35.820 --> 00:52:38.140]   because they don't have the ability to even manufacture
[00:52:38.140 --> 00:52:41.220]   and distribute on an international scale hardware like that.
[00:52:41.220 --> 00:52:43.580]   They can simply say, let's start with English.
[00:52:43.580 --> 00:52:45.180]   Even Google, I think, right?
[00:52:45.180 --> 00:52:46.900]   I've seen it remember last week or something,
[00:52:46.900 --> 00:52:49.820]   they had some sort of piece of news about,
[00:52:49.820 --> 00:52:53.260]   I'm sorry, for their translate app.
[00:52:53.260 --> 00:52:55.620]   You know, the visual translation app,
[00:52:55.620 --> 00:52:58.140]   where they're promising, they're very proud
[00:52:58.140 --> 00:53:00.700]   of like the half dozen to dozen languages that they have.
[00:53:00.700 --> 00:53:01.900]   They are apologetic.
[00:53:01.900 --> 00:53:03.740]   They don't have every single language on the planet
[00:53:03.740 --> 00:53:05.540]   and they intend to get there.
[00:53:05.540 --> 00:53:07.460]   But that's part of the responsibility of doing an app,
[00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:09.060]   like doing an app like that.
[00:53:09.060 --> 00:53:10.420]   - We get a ton of complaints from people
[00:53:10.420 --> 00:53:12.340]   who are bi or trilingual that things like Siri
[00:53:12.340 --> 00:53:14.260]   just don't automatically know what language they're speaking
[00:53:14.260 --> 00:53:16.060]   on their changed languages, mid-sentence.
[00:53:16.060 --> 00:53:19.020]   And you talk to people who are allowed to talk about this stuff
[00:53:19.020 --> 00:53:21.380]   and they try to explain how really hard it is
[00:53:21.380 --> 00:53:23.180]   for them to do one language and not even really get it.
[00:53:23.180 --> 00:53:25.180]   - People are complaining they can't speak to Siri
[00:53:25.180 --> 00:53:27.540]   in three different languages at the same time.
[00:53:27.540 --> 00:53:29.100]   - I mean, you just want it to work
[00:53:29.100 --> 00:53:30.580]   the way you want it to work, Leo.
[00:53:30.580 --> 00:53:32.420]   I mean, sometimes it's like, how long?
[00:53:32.420 --> 00:53:34.460]   - It's a French or a series switch to Italian
[00:53:34.460 --> 00:53:35.900]   and then says Siri switch back.
[00:53:35.900 --> 00:53:38.100]   I mean, there's different levels of what they want.
[00:53:38.100 --> 00:53:40.580]   - Let's see what that would be hard to do.
[00:53:40.580 --> 00:53:42.180]   - God, you get mad enough when you roll over
[00:53:42.180 --> 00:53:43.940]   on your TV remote and suddenly all the titles
[00:53:43.940 --> 00:53:45.860]   are in Spanish, imagine.
[00:53:45.860 --> 00:53:47.460]   (laughing)
[00:53:47.460 --> 00:53:50.860]   - L, Siri, you'll request okay,
[00:53:50.860 --> 00:53:53.100]   Torfevore and Inglace.
[00:53:53.100 --> 00:53:55.020]   - Well, it happens mostly like with Apple music
[00:53:55.020 --> 00:53:56.260]   if they want to say play music,
[00:53:56.260 --> 00:53:58.580]   but the title of the music is in a different language.
[00:53:58.580 --> 00:53:59.740]   Like it happens if you're in Spanish
[00:53:59.740 --> 00:54:01.220]   and you ask you to play an American song,
[00:54:01.220 --> 00:54:03.060]   you're using please play in Spanish
[00:54:03.060 --> 00:54:04.460]   than the name of the title in American.
[00:54:04.460 --> 00:54:06.340]   It doesn't always seem to work the way they want it to.
[00:54:06.340 --> 00:54:07.980]   (laughing)
[00:54:07.980 --> 00:54:10.820]   - Okay, it would be useful for learning languages.
[00:54:10.820 --> 00:54:12.540]   Just change the language of your TV
[00:54:12.540 --> 00:54:14.700]   and make your kids learn Spanish.
[00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:16.060]   (laughing)
[00:54:16.060 --> 00:54:17.700]   Really incense them.
[00:54:17.700 --> 00:54:18.900]   - That's the kind of problem that companies like
[00:54:18.900 --> 00:54:20.740]   Nuance and Apple and Google are all trying to solve.
[00:54:20.740 --> 00:54:22.420]   - I know, I know big problems, yeah.
[00:54:22.420 --> 00:54:23.340]   Very interesting.
[00:54:23.340 --> 00:54:28.100]   Speaking of government intervention, the EU,
[00:54:28.100 --> 00:54:29.740]   European Union has decided, no,
[00:54:29.740 --> 00:54:32.180]   Apple's actually, they're not colluding
[00:54:32.180 --> 00:54:34.020]   with the music labels to kill free music.
[00:54:34.020 --> 00:54:38.140]   Sorry, never mind, move on.
[00:54:38.140 --> 00:54:41.380]   Now isn't there, isn't a similar investigation
[00:54:41.380 --> 00:54:42.740]   going on in the US?
[00:54:42.740 --> 00:54:45.220]   - Yeah, the attorneys general are all over.
[00:54:45.220 --> 00:54:46.420]   - I love that, yeah.
[00:54:46.420 --> 00:54:50.020]   So presumably, I don't know how much the FTC
[00:54:50.020 --> 00:54:53.420]   pays attention to the EU or the EC, but.
[00:54:53.420 --> 00:54:55.940]   - Maybe, I think that Apple, you know,
[00:54:55.940 --> 00:54:57.860]   is not colluding for Apple to go public
[00:54:57.860 --> 00:55:00.460]   and say, you know, people should be paying for the music.
[00:55:00.460 --> 00:55:02.220]   - They'd be going behind the scenes
[00:55:02.220 --> 00:55:05.300]   and pressuring them, which they were rumored to be doing.
[00:55:05.300 --> 00:55:06.140]   - Yeah, and that's the point.
[00:55:06.140 --> 00:55:09.820]   - They were rumored to be going to the labels saying,
[00:55:09.820 --> 00:55:11.420]   you know, it's not in your interest,
[00:55:11.420 --> 00:55:12.580]   and it's certainly not in our interest
[00:55:12.580 --> 00:55:15.260]   that Spotify be allowed to give away music for free.
[00:55:15.260 --> 00:55:16.220]   What do you think?
[00:55:16.220 --> 00:55:19.940]   But apparently the EU said that they didn't have.
[00:55:19.940 --> 00:55:21.980]   - I think I should have gone off the tailors.
[00:55:21.980 --> 00:55:24.380]   - Yeah, now that's collusion.
[00:55:24.380 --> 00:55:28.140]   Now that's pressure, that's peer pressure.
[00:55:28.140 --> 00:55:29.980]   - I believe she is, you regulated, yes.
[00:55:29.980 --> 00:55:33.260]   - Apparently the EU did talk to Sony and UMG
[00:55:33.260 --> 00:55:35.860]   and Warner Music and say, hey, did anything happen?
[00:55:35.860 --> 00:55:38.460]   And they said no, so they said, okay, never mind.
[00:55:39.420 --> 00:55:42.020]   Did they talk to Taylor Swift, I think is the real question.
[00:55:42.020 --> 00:55:45.780]   And when will Taylor Swift enter the presidential race,
[00:55:45.780 --> 00:55:47.660]   I think is the real question.
[00:55:47.660 --> 00:55:48.500]   - A lot of us.
[00:55:48.500 --> 00:55:50.620]   - You know, at this point, I think she'd get the vote.
[00:55:50.620 --> 00:55:51.460]   - She'd win.
[00:55:51.460 --> 00:55:54.100]   - Well, I'd love to see her and Donald Trump debate.
[00:55:54.100 --> 00:55:55.380]   - Geez Louise.
[00:55:55.380 --> 00:55:56.620]   - That would be just the two of them.
[00:55:56.620 --> 00:55:59.260]   - How long though before, actually,
[00:55:59.260 --> 00:56:02.260]   he's completely off topic, but how long before
[00:56:02.260 --> 00:56:04.220]   the president really becomes the person
[00:56:04.220 --> 00:56:06.540]   who has the most active Twitter following?
[00:56:06.540 --> 00:56:08.740]   How long before Cortana wins, Leo?
[00:56:08.740 --> 00:56:09.580]   - Or Cortana?
[00:56:09.580 --> 00:56:10.660]   - Yeah.
[00:56:10.660 --> 00:56:12.500]   - No, but I think, you know,
[00:56:12.500 --> 00:56:14.900]   Donald Trump's showing the power of television.
[00:56:14.900 --> 00:56:17.500]   If you're a TV star, you could be almost anybody
[00:56:17.500 --> 00:56:20.660]   in the polls just because of face recognition.
[00:56:20.660 --> 00:56:24.100]   - Not just face recognition, Yuke.
[00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:26.900]   What does he, we know exactly what he stands for.
[00:56:26.900 --> 00:56:28.780]   He's an ass, that's his brand.
[00:56:28.780 --> 00:56:30.620]   We know that it's the ass brand.
[00:56:30.620 --> 00:56:32.620]   - But he'd be such a good ass president.
[00:56:32.620 --> 00:56:36.100]   - No, exactly, so like when you have like 10 people like,
[00:56:36.100 --> 00:56:39.020]   "Hi, I'm a white guy in a dark suit and a tie."
[00:56:39.020 --> 00:56:40.460]   - Hi, I'm also a white guy in a dark suit.
[00:56:40.460 --> 00:56:41.540]   - He's interesting.
[00:56:41.540 --> 00:56:44.700]   - Hi, I'm a woman in a dark suit
[00:56:44.700 --> 00:56:46.860]   and a sort of a tie-ish sort of thing.
[00:56:46.860 --> 00:56:48.900]   - I have a comb over and you're stupid.
[00:56:48.900 --> 00:56:51.700]   I'm interested.
[00:56:51.700 --> 00:56:56.060]   - Even though Obama, I recall, didn't really break out
[00:56:56.060 --> 00:56:59.460]   until he had that one great, here's an opportunity,
[00:56:59.460 --> 00:57:02.460]   the opposition party is trying to paint me
[00:57:02.460 --> 00:57:07.460]   as someone whose preacher is a radical black,
[00:57:07.460 --> 00:57:10.380]   violent person who preaches, who preaches hate,
[00:57:10.380 --> 00:57:13.540]   race hate, I am now going to slap that down completely
[00:57:13.540 --> 00:57:16.180]   by making the statement on race in America
[00:57:16.180 --> 00:57:18.580]   that I knew that at some point during this campaign,
[00:57:18.580 --> 00:57:19.420]   I was going to make it.
[00:57:19.420 --> 00:57:21.780]   That's when everybody knew, everybody got a chance
[00:57:21.780 --> 00:57:24.740]   to hear and be presidential and be the sort of person
[00:57:24.740 --> 00:57:26.860]   you want in charge commanding troops
[00:57:26.860 --> 00:57:28.500]   and in charge when there's a hurricane coming
[00:57:28.500 --> 00:57:31.580]   and in charge when you just suddenly lost your job
[00:57:31.580 --> 00:57:36.100]   or something, you define people by their moments
[00:57:36.100 --> 00:57:38.620]   and Trump is defined by, again, the moments where he is
[00:57:38.620 --> 00:57:41.060]   an ass, which means that he has a known quantity
[00:57:41.060 --> 00:57:42.140]   and people are going to listen to him.
[00:57:42.140 --> 00:57:45.380]   But once the other Republican candidate comes out
[00:57:45.380 --> 00:57:48.420]   and simply says, here is why I'm relevant for this generation,
[00:57:48.420 --> 00:57:51.300]   here's why I'm even a better choice for Democrats
[00:57:51.300 --> 00:57:52.620]   than the Democrats. - That's why Taylor Swift
[00:57:52.620 --> 00:57:53.460]   should run.
[00:57:53.460 --> 00:57:57.100]   - Taylor Swift's first Secretary of State Donald Trump Jr.
[00:57:57.100 --> 00:57:59.540]   (laughing)
[00:57:59.540 --> 00:58:02.540]   - I'm just so amused by this.
[00:58:02.540 --> 00:58:03.540]   I can't tell you.
[00:58:03.540 --> 00:58:06.700]   I mean, we're far enough before the election
[00:58:06.700 --> 00:58:09.260]   that I can afford to be silly about this.
[00:58:09.260 --> 00:58:13.580]   I'm so enjoying this ongoing reality show, Trainwreck,
[00:58:13.580 --> 00:58:16.340]   knowing that at some point inevitably,
[00:58:16.340 --> 00:58:18.540]   he's going to either double down and double down
[00:58:18.540 --> 00:58:20.100]   on a springtime for Hitler strategy.
[00:58:20.100 --> 00:58:22.820]   I really think his strategy is, at some point,
[00:58:22.820 --> 00:58:25.020]   I just kind of keep making it a more and more ridiculous
[00:58:25.020 --> 00:58:27.740]   campaign until I'm forced out because I'm not allowed
[00:58:27.740 --> 00:58:29.620]   to quit, that's not my brand.
[00:58:29.620 --> 00:58:32.540]   I have to say that I'm being forced out.
[00:58:32.540 --> 00:58:34.100]   - Could it be like nuclear war where you finally go
[00:58:34.100 --> 00:58:35.580]   to pull the thing on the election night
[00:58:35.580 --> 00:58:36.420]   and you just can't do it?
[00:58:36.420 --> 00:58:37.500]   Like you're all set to vote for Trump
[00:58:37.500 --> 00:58:38.620]   and then you're about to pull it
[00:58:38.620 --> 00:58:40.820]   and you just, the whole thing flashes in front of your head
[00:58:40.820 --> 00:58:43.180]   and you go, nah, and pull any other level you can?
[00:58:43.180 --> 00:58:48.180]   - How about, I think that Hillary's best chances are
[00:58:48.180 --> 00:58:51.580]   have her name legally changed to anybody but Trump.
[00:58:51.580 --> 00:58:53.540]   (laughing)
[00:58:53.540 --> 00:58:56.300]   She suddenly becomes the front reader in every single poll.
[00:58:56.300 --> 00:59:01.300]   - Who's the, I think you have Doug Ford, don't you?
[00:59:01.300 --> 00:59:04.900]   They're in the Canadian.
[00:59:04.900 --> 00:59:07.820]   - We have, our elections are funny 'cause they can call them
[00:59:07.820 --> 00:59:09.220]   between any specified pay time.
[00:59:09.220 --> 00:59:10.060]   - Anytime they want.
[00:59:10.060 --> 00:59:10.900]   - They want.
[00:59:10.900 --> 00:59:11.980]   - Well, I think it's between three and five years.
[00:59:11.980 --> 00:59:13.260]   - And campaigns are short, right?
[00:59:13.260 --> 00:59:14.100]   They're weeks.
[00:59:14.100 --> 00:59:15.940]   - Yeah, it's like a couple of months at most.
[00:59:15.940 --> 00:59:17.460]   We had our debates the same night as yours.
[00:59:17.460 --> 00:59:20.100]   No one in the world knew that we were having debates.
[00:59:20.100 --> 00:59:22.380]   And then we just vote, and you can't vote for the person
[00:59:22.380 --> 00:59:24.500]   who's having the debate anyway because the person
[00:59:24.500 --> 00:59:25.340]   who's running the party.
[00:59:25.340 --> 00:59:26.180]   - Rob Ford.
[00:59:26.180 --> 00:59:27.460]   - You vote for your local MP and they become the prime.
[00:59:27.460 --> 00:59:28.300]   I mean.
[00:59:28.300 --> 00:59:29.980]   - Rob Ford, who's who I was trying to think of.
[00:59:29.980 --> 00:59:30.820]   - Rob Ford.
[00:59:30.820 --> 00:59:31.660]   - Rob Ford.
[00:59:31.660 --> 00:59:32.740]   - You guys, he is super ball.
[00:59:32.740 --> 00:59:34.340]   Every few years you just have these two parties
[00:59:34.340 --> 00:59:35.940]   running at each other as fast as they can
[00:59:35.940 --> 00:59:38.940]   and everyone just drinks a lot and that's fine.
[00:59:38.940 --> 00:59:41.940]   - In the UK, isn't it true that the candidates
[00:59:41.940 --> 00:59:44.860]   are legally required not to spend more than expounds
[00:59:44.860 --> 00:59:46.860]   on their entire campaign?
[00:59:46.860 --> 00:59:47.700]   - It's amazing.
[00:59:47.700 --> 00:59:50.020]   We have a non-elected Senate and because we can't agree
[00:59:50.020 --> 00:59:51.900]   on how to change it, they're just not appointing senators.
[00:59:51.900 --> 00:59:54.340]   So Senate just keeps getting smaller and smaller.
[00:59:55.180 --> 00:59:58.980]   - After one month after, a little more than a month,
[00:59:58.980 --> 01:00:02.700]   six weeks after unveiling Apple Music, Eddie Q says,
[01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:03.940]   it's doing very well.
[01:00:03.940 --> 01:00:04.940]   Thank you very much.
[01:00:04.940 --> 01:00:08.700]   11 million trial members.
[01:00:08.700 --> 01:00:11.540]   For some reason they're giving out the number
[01:00:11.540 --> 01:00:14.140]   that two million are buying the family plan
[01:00:14.140 --> 01:00:15.900]   or have already bought the family.
[01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:18.300]   Can you clarify this for me, Renee?
[01:00:18.300 --> 01:00:20.260]   I'm sure you understand.
[01:00:20.260 --> 01:00:22.900]   - Yeah, so when you sign up, you're initially--
[01:00:22.900 --> 01:00:24.980]   - It's true for three, three months trial
[01:00:24.980 --> 01:00:27.220]   for the single user but you can go into the account settings
[01:00:27.220 --> 01:00:28.060]   and change it.
[01:00:28.060 --> 01:00:29.580]   - So nobody's paying, yeah, you can't pay
[01:00:29.580 --> 01:00:31.060]   even if you wanted to.
[01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:32.700]   - The nice thing about the family thing is you can either
[01:00:32.700 --> 01:00:34.100]   use it for six of your own devices
[01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:36.180]   or you can spread it out among six family members.
[01:00:36.180 --> 01:00:38.380]   So it just means that people are choosing to do that.
[01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:39.860]   - Well, that's interesting.
[01:00:39.860 --> 01:00:41.580]   - Six, like you can have it on as many devices you want,
[01:00:41.580 --> 01:00:43.980]   simultaneously playing it on, say, up to six devices.
[01:00:43.980 --> 01:00:46.580]   - So right now I can only play it at any one time
[01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:47.740]   on one device.
[01:00:47.740 --> 01:00:48.860]   - Theoretically.
[01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:51.940]   - But if I got the family plan, I could listen on.
[01:00:51.940 --> 01:00:55.420]   I don't know why I'd want to, but I could listen on six devices.
[01:00:55.420 --> 01:00:56.700]   - Yeah, and spread them among six people
[01:00:56.700 --> 01:00:59.700]   on a family sharing account if you have that set up.
[01:00:59.700 --> 01:01:02.940]   - Well, given that when they bought Beats Music,
[01:01:02.940 --> 01:01:04.900]   it had 110,000 subscribers.
[01:01:04.900 --> 01:01:06.980]   This is a, this is good.
[01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:08.860]   This is 10 times bigger.
[01:01:08.860 --> 01:01:11.220]   But of course, it's still the trial period
[01:01:11.220 --> 01:01:12.660]   and it's a lot easier just to say,
[01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:15.180]   yeah, I'll take it for free for three months.
[01:01:15.180 --> 01:01:16.700]   - Yeah, I mean, obviously the big thing will be
[01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:18.220]   when they get to the end of that trial period,
[01:01:18.220 --> 01:01:20.380]   what those numbers actually end up to be.
[01:01:20.380 --> 01:01:23.420]   But I bet they're going to be five or six million minimum.
[01:01:23.420 --> 01:01:24.260]   - I think so.
[01:01:24.260 --> 01:01:26.460]   I think if you've got 11 million in the trial,
[01:01:26.460 --> 01:01:29.580]   least half of them are going to forget to turn it off.
[01:01:29.580 --> 01:01:31.220]   - So the bill comes.
[01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:35.260]   - I think even then, I think it's that default thing, right?
[01:01:35.260 --> 01:01:37.860]   If you, yeah, what the hell?
[01:01:37.860 --> 01:01:38.700]   All right, I'll keep it.
[01:01:38.700 --> 01:01:39.540]   - It's only $10.
[01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:40.620]   - It's only $10.
[01:01:40.620 --> 01:01:41.460]   What the hell?
[01:01:41.460 --> 01:01:44.780]   I swear, if you can get 11 million people to try something,
[01:01:44.780 --> 01:01:47.620]   I would love to know what that number is.
[01:01:47.620 --> 01:01:51.300]   - Phil Lyben, who is the former CEO of Evernote,
[01:01:51.300 --> 01:01:54.140]   told me that the freemium model for them,
[01:01:54.140 --> 01:01:56.980]   and I think they were fairly consistent
[01:01:56.980 --> 01:02:00.060]   across a lot of different apps,
[01:02:00.060 --> 01:02:02.860]   is that you'd get about something
[01:02:02.860 --> 01:02:06.500]   between two, three, four, five, at best 5%
[01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:08.940]   of the free users would end up going premium.
[01:02:08.940 --> 01:02:12.580]   But I bet Apple does better than that.
[01:02:12.580 --> 01:02:15.020]   - Well also, you got them in the showroom
[01:02:15.020 --> 01:02:16.860]   and that's like the best steps
[01:02:16.860 --> 01:02:17.860]   of the cash register.
[01:02:17.860 --> 01:02:21.620]   I mean, I've wound up signing up for Evernote premium,
[01:02:21.620 --> 01:02:25.220]   not because I made a shrewd and longstanding evaluation
[01:02:25.220 --> 01:02:27.140]   with flip charts and stuff about the values
[01:02:27.140 --> 01:02:28.460]   I'm getting out of my Evernote,
[01:02:28.460 --> 01:02:31.900]   but simply it was almost an impulse thing
[01:02:31.900 --> 01:02:35.300]   where they did a pop up when I was in some app
[01:02:35.300 --> 01:02:38.540]   or on the web saying, well, here's what you can do
[01:02:38.540 --> 01:02:41.500]   if you, not even an ad, it's like, here's a feature
[01:02:41.500 --> 01:02:43.900]   that you're not using, you could be using for using premium.
[01:02:43.900 --> 01:02:46.420]   And I actually thought about it for 30, 40 seconds
[01:02:46.420 --> 01:02:49.860]   and realized that I'm relying so much on Evernote now
[01:02:49.860 --> 01:02:52.140]   that I feel like I need to pay for it
[01:02:52.140 --> 01:02:53.860]   just to be a good person.
[01:02:53.860 --> 01:02:55.220]   - That's exactly why I bought it.
[01:02:55.220 --> 01:02:56.780]   I didn't need the premium features.
[01:02:56.780 --> 01:02:58.340]   I wanted to give them money.
[01:02:58.340 --> 01:03:02.700]   - Right, whereas if they'd switched me off after 60 or 90 days,
[01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:04.900]   at some point I'd say, okay, what else can I use
[01:03:04.900 --> 01:03:06.740]   that's a no-giver app?
[01:03:06.740 --> 01:03:08.580]   - Yeah, nobody's gonna say, oh, I like Apple.
[01:03:08.580 --> 01:03:10.140]   I'm gonna give Apple money.
[01:03:10.140 --> 01:03:12.340]   As much as we love Apple, I don't think people are gonna say,
[01:03:12.340 --> 01:03:13.660]   let me give you $10 a month.
[01:03:13.660 --> 01:03:14.740]   I just like-- - On the contrast,
[01:03:14.740 --> 01:03:16.740]   there's no free, unlike Spotify,
[01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:18.100]   other things, there is no free tier.
[01:03:18.100 --> 01:03:19.380]   You basically give up the ability to play
[01:03:19.380 --> 01:03:20.620]   in your song you want whenever you want.
[01:03:20.620 --> 01:03:23.820]   So it depends on how valuable that service is to you.
[01:03:23.820 --> 01:03:25.460]   So the commercial might be very different
[01:03:25.460 --> 01:03:28.180]   than a service like Evernote that has a completely usable app,
[01:03:28.180 --> 01:03:29.380]   even if you don't pay for it.
[01:03:29.380 --> 01:03:31.380]   - I think Apple has a number, like they need this money
[01:03:31.380 --> 01:03:33.500]   to make it successful.
[01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:36.340]   They probably have to-- - They probably have to--
[01:03:36.340 --> 01:03:37.740]   - To produce up the music industry, right?
[01:03:37.740 --> 01:03:40.180]   They have to-- - Well, they have to provide
[01:03:40.180 --> 01:03:41.740]   an audience. - Right.
[01:03:41.740 --> 01:03:44.540]   - If they're not providing a dollar amount
[01:03:44.540 --> 01:03:47.540]   of purchases that people can be buying stuff
[01:03:47.540 --> 01:03:48.620]   month after month after month,
[01:03:48.620 --> 01:03:50.060]   'cause that number is going down, down, down,
[01:03:50.060 --> 01:03:51.180]   no matter where you're buying from,
[01:03:51.180 --> 01:03:52.940]   they need to be able to tell these companies
[01:03:52.940 --> 01:03:55.820]   that here are the, here's the quantity of people
[01:03:55.820 --> 01:03:58.740]   we will deliver to you month after month after month.
[01:03:58.740 --> 01:04:00.620]   Not only that, but here's the quality of people
[01:04:00.620 --> 01:04:02.140]   we will deliver to you.
[01:04:02.140 --> 01:04:04.220]   People you're not gonna be able to reach efficiently
[01:04:04.220 --> 01:04:05.140]   on your own.
[01:04:05.140 --> 01:04:06.780]   So I have no idea what those numbers are,
[01:04:06.780 --> 01:04:10.300]   but I'm absolutely certain it's more than a strict number
[01:04:10.300 --> 01:04:12.500]   of here's how many people have signed up for it.
[01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:15.300]   Here's how many people after 90 days are now paying for it.
[01:04:15.300 --> 01:04:18.540]   - There must be some pro forma that they have to
[01:04:18.540 --> 01:04:20.860]   give the record industry both for the--
[01:04:20.860 --> 01:04:22.700]   - But I think they probably-- - For radio and--
[01:04:22.700 --> 01:04:24.460]   - For streaming, what?
[01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:25.300]   - They probably need a couple,
[01:04:25.300 --> 01:04:26.660]   they probably have a couple of years to--
[01:04:26.660 --> 01:04:27.500]   - Right. - To make that,
[01:04:27.500 --> 01:04:28.340]   to mature that.
[01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:30.460]   So two or three years at least,
[01:04:30.460 --> 01:04:31.460]   to mature that process.
[01:04:31.460 --> 01:04:32.940]   And I think they could get,
[01:04:32.940 --> 01:04:35.780]   they could probably get as big or bigger than Spotify
[01:04:35.780 --> 01:04:38.260]   in that period of time, maybe even in the first year.
[01:04:38.260 --> 01:04:39.860]   And so I think that at that point,
[01:04:39.860 --> 01:04:41.900]   and I think the Beats One thing is an interesting thing.
[01:04:41.900 --> 01:04:44.700]   I'm not that excited about it, but the radio thing--
[01:04:44.700 --> 01:04:47.700]   - Everybody in Kilgolly listening to Beats One.
[01:04:47.700 --> 01:04:48.980]   - Yeah.
[01:04:48.980 --> 01:04:49.820]   Nobody is.
[01:04:49.820 --> 01:04:51.820]   - 'Cause that was one of the ideas was,
[01:04:51.820 --> 01:04:53.220]   "Hey, everybody will be listening to the station
[01:04:53.220 --> 01:04:54.620]   "at the same time all over the world.
[01:04:54.620 --> 01:04:56.060]   "It'll be global."
[01:04:56.060 --> 01:04:57.540]   Bring us all together. - Well, okay.
[01:04:57.540 --> 01:04:58.900]   - No, no, it doesn't have to be everyone.
[01:04:58.900 --> 01:05:03.260]   I mean, just the growing audience in that realm
[01:05:03.260 --> 01:05:05.460]   could end up being the largest radio audience
[01:05:05.460 --> 01:05:06.940]   that has ever existed.
[01:05:06.940 --> 01:05:08.740]   I mean, so it doesn't, you know, regardless of where--
[01:05:08.740 --> 01:05:09.900]   - That's true. - Everyone's listening to it.
[01:05:09.900 --> 01:05:11.940]   You know, getting to, if you get to a point
[01:05:11.940 --> 01:05:15.140]   where there are 30 million or 40 million people
[01:05:15.140 --> 01:05:17.380]   listening for some big event, and that's the big question,
[01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:20.780]   is when do they get the right band there for interview
[01:05:20.780 --> 01:05:24.260]   or the right whatever, where you have that lazy Sunday moment
[01:05:24.260 --> 01:05:27.340]   where it's just everyone is there and something happens
[01:05:27.340 --> 01:05:28.740]   and that kind of thing.
[01:05:28.740 --> 01:05:31.860]   - Apple has the right to do Beats Two, Three, Four, and Five
[01:05:31.860 --> 01:05:35.220]   according to a leak of their agreements
[01:05:35.220 --> 01:05:37.380]   with the music industry.
[01:05:37.380 --> 01:05:38.220]   - Yep.
[01:05:38.220 --> 01:05:39.060]   - That'd be interesting.
[01:05:39.060 --> 01:05:41.380]   I mean, I see no reason to have one station.
[01:05:41.380 --> 01:05:43.980]   I think it'd be really interesting to have a,
[01:05:43.980 --> 01:05:46.260]   'cause right now, if you don't like the music
[01:05:46.260 --> 01:05:47.500]   that's playing, there's nowhere to go.
[01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:50.100]   It's like, you turn it off.
[01:05:50.100 --> 01:05:54.580]   - Isn't this, it's so remarkable how consistent Apple is.
[01:05:54.580 --> 01:05:59.140]   This is, it's no joke that they train all of their executives
[01:05:59.140 --> 01:06:00.540]   on here's how Apple does things.
[01:06:00.540 --> 01:06:03.140]   - Right. - They behave so similarly.
[01:06:03.140 --> 01:06:05.980]   It's, the music service is the exact same way.
[01:06:05.980 --> 01:06:08.940]   Let's make one thing to be, we got a big ambitions,
[01:06:08.940 --> 01:06:10.340]   but we're gonna start with one station
[01:06:10.340 --> 01:06:11.860]   and we're gonna get that sorted out
[01:06:11.860 --> 01:06:13.540]   and then we're gonna add more features,
[01:06:13.540 --> 01:06:16.580]   i.e. more stations and more audience as we go along.
[01:06:16.580 --> 01:06:19.020]   Once we figured out how Beats One works
[01:06:19.020 --> 01:06:20.980]   and learn our lessons to apply there,
[01:06:20.980 --> 01:06:24.500]   same reasons why the iPhone didn't do very much
[01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:26.140]   to start with and it took two or three years
[01:06:26.140 --> 01:06:27.980]   to become a real product, just like the Apple Watch,
[01:06:27.980 --> 01:06:31.180]   just like even the Mac, really, it's just traditional
[01:06:31.180 --> 01:06:33.460]   that they start small and then grow out.
[01:06:33.460 --> 01:06:36.780]   It's companies like Yahoo, where they really try to say,
[01:06:36.780 --> 01:06:40.060]   we are reinventing ourselves, we have dynamited
[01:06:40.060 --> 01:06:42.740]   every single building and now we've rented a whole bunch
[01:06:42.740 --> 01:06:45.380]   of folding chairs and laptops for everybody to sit
[01:06:45.380 --> 01:06:48.060]   in the rubble and build something brand new
[01:06:48.060 --> 01:06:50.300]   in the rubble of what we've just destroyed.
[01:06:50.300 --> 01:06:52.100]   It's, no, let's tear down one building.
[01:06:52.100 --> 01:06:53.780]   No, actually, let's renovate one building.
[01:06:53.780 --> 01:06:56.220]   We'll get one of those present bathtub enclosures
[01:06:56.220 --> 01:06:58.460]   where they fix the bathroom in one afternoon
[01:06:58.460 --> 01:07:00.020]   and then we'll grow out from there.
[01:07:00.020 --> 01:07:00.860]   - We'll see how that works. - We'll see how that works.
[01:07:00.860 --> 01:07:01.700]   - We'll leave that. - We'll leave that.
[01:07:01.700 --> 01:07:02.860]   - We'll leave that working toilet.
[01:07:02.860 --> 01:07:03.940]   - Beats One.
[01:07:03.940 --> 01:07:06.020]   It's as good as a working toilet.
[01:07:06.020 --> 01:07:07.780]   - It's our working toilet. - It's our working toilet.
[01:07:07.780 --> 01:07:08.740]   - Always on.
[01:07:08.740 --> 01:07:10.340]   (laughing)
[01:07:10.340 --> 01:07:11.180]   Can you get it? - No, sir.
[01:07:11.180 --> 01:07:12.340]   - Canada, is it? - Yes.
[01:07:12.340 --> 01:07:13.540]   - No, sir, I thought you mentioned
[01:07:13.540 --> 01:07:16.020]   you were using North Korea, you can't turn them off.
[01:07:16.020 --> 01:07:17.460]   If you try, you'll be arrested.
[01:07:17.460 --> 01:07:22.460]   - Unlike the Apple music, it's, well, maybe Apple music.
[01:07:22.460 --> 01:07:23.380]   - Yeah, it's all international.
[01:07:23.380 --> 01:07:25.020]   The original Beat service was US only,
[01:07:25.020 --> 01:07:26.060]   which is why it had very, well,
[01:07:26.060 --> 01:07:27.940]   one of the reasons why it had very small numbers.
[01:07:27.940 --> 01:07:28.780]   - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:07:28.780 --> 01:07:31.100]   That would give you 10 times the numbers right there.
[01:07:31.100 --> 01:07:31.940]   - Absolutely.
[01:07:31.940 --> 01:07:35.180]   And I think, like Alex said, it's sort of model
[01:07:35.180 --> 01:07:37.260]   in the British system, which is much more energizing
[01:07:37.260 --> 01:07:39.300]   and engaging in something a lot of North American audiences
[01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:40.540]   haven't heard in a long time.
[01:07:40.540 --> 01:07:42.660]   - Well, let me tell you, sir, Elton John
[01:07:42.660 --> 01:07:46.940]   has a show on Beats One, and he performed on Sunday night
[01:07:46.940 --> 01:07:51.260]   at the Outside Lands concert in San Francisco,
[01:07:51.260 --> 01:07:52.540]   the big festival.
[01:07:52.540 --> 01:07:56.460]   My son, who is 21, will be 21 in a week, was there
[01:07:56.460 --> 01:07:59.340]   and tells me, so I said, well, who was your favorite act?
[01:07:59.340 --> 01:08:02.380]   And I thought he's gonna say, you know, I don't know.
[01:08:02.380 --> 01:08:03.260]   - Imagine Dragons.
[01:08:03.260 --> 01:08:04.500]   - Yeah, you know what, it's so funny
[01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:06.940]   you should say that 'cause that's who I thought he might say.
[01:08:06.940 --> 01:08:10.460]   He likes, maybe Steve Ioki, he likes the EDM.
[01:08:10.460 --> 01:08:12.340]   Elton John, he said Elton John far and away
[01:08:12.340 --> 01:08:13.180]   the best concert.
[01:08:13.180 --> 01:08:16.100]   - Sir Elton. - Sir Elton.
[01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:16.940]   - Paul Malio.
[01:08:16.940 --> 01:08:17.780]   - Huh?
[01:08:17.780 --> 01:08:19.380]   He's a performer, exactly.
[01:08:19.380 --> 01:08:22.820]   - You learn a few things by doing nothing,
[01:08:22.820 --> 01:08:25.260]   book touring and touring and touring year after year.
[01:08:25.260 --> 01:08:28.380]   I actually like to see Billy Joel as well because
[01:08:28.380 --> 01:08:30.420]   if this person does like this many dates
[01:08:30.420 --> 01:08:34.460]   for this many years, you imagine that that show is tight.
[01:08:34.460 --> 01:08:35.300]   At this point.
[01:08:35.300 --> 01:08:36.300]   (laughing)
[01:08:36.300 --> 01:08:39.260]   - Well, there's also something, and I kind of made a hobby
[01:08:39.260 --> 01:08:42.660]   of going and watching the old performers,
[01:08:42.660 --> 01:08:44.740]   the most seasoned performers for years.
[01:08:44.740 --> 01:08:48.540]   In fact, they used to perform at the Venetian Room
[01:08:48.540 --> 01:08:50.220]   at the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco.
[01:08:50.220 --> 01:08:55.220]   Every two weeks it'd be Tony Bennett and Carol Channing.
[01:08:55.220 --> 01:08:58.660]   And I used to go and I would watch not so much
[01:08:58.660 --> 01:09:00.540]   for the entertainment or the music,
[01:09:00.540 --> 01:09:02.580]   but to watch somebody who's performed
[01:09:02.580 --> 01:09:04.820]   for live audiences for 50 years.
[01:09:04.820 --> 01:09:07.140]   'Cause there's something, there's a way they can perform.
[01:09:07.140 --> 01:09:08.580]   There's a rapport they have with the audience
[01:09:08.580 --> 01:09:11.340]   that's learned over many, many years.
[01:09:11.340 --> 01:09:13.220]   It's really interesting to watch.
[01:09:13.220 --> 01:09:16.300]   And if everyone's unique, I understand Billy Joel
[01:09:16.300 --> 01:09:20.140]   is playing the Madison Square Garden every Tuesday now.
[01:09:20.140 --> 01:09:22.660]   - And doesn't he normally sell it out?
[01:09:22.660 --> 01:09:23.580]   - Yeah.
[01:09:23.580 --> 01:09:25.580]   - He's played there like a hundred times.
[01:09:25.580 --> 01:09:28.020]   - He hasn't had a new record in years.
[01:09:28.020 --> 01:09:31.820]   It's like at some point, these performers,
[01:09:31.820 --> 01:09:33.340]   Jay Leno has spoken about this,
[01:09:33.340 --> 01:09:35.940]   how he notices that his crowds are getting smaller,
[01:09:35.940 --> 01:09:40.940]   but he'd much rather sell out a 2000th seat theater
[01:09:40.940 --> 01:09:44.620]   than sell 5,000 tickets and a 7,000 seat theater.
[01:09:44.620 --> 01:09:46.100]   But he's still selling things out.
[01:09:46.100 --> 01:09:46.940]   What is he doing?
[01:09:46.940 --> 01:09:47.780]   What does he know?
[01:09:47.780 --> 01:09:48.740]   - How big is Madison Square Garden?
[01:09:48.740 --> 01:09:50.740]   - I mean, you know, man, it's a nice song.
[01:09:50.740 --> 01:09:52.340]   - But yeah, there must be a show there.
[01:09:52.340 --> 01:09:53.180]   You're right.
[01:09:53.180 --> 01:09:54.860]   Look at this is Billy Joel of the Garden.
[01:09:54.860 --> 01:09:57.900]   He by the way, he's like a French, he's like the Knicks.
[01:09:57.900 --> 01:09:59.620]   He actually just kind of like, he said,
[01:09:59.620 --> 01:10:02.260]   "Wrent, this is how many performances this year
[01:10:02.260 --> 01:10:03.260]   at the Garden."
[01:10:03.260 --> 01:10:04.300]   (laughing)
[01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:05.140]   - He's an institution.
[01:10:05.140 --> 01:10:06.220]   - He's an institution.
[01:10:06.220 --> 01:10:08.020]   He's a great man.
[01:10:08.020 --> 01:10:11.580]   He is now the longest run of any artist,
[01:10:11.580 --> 01:10:15.580]   12 sold out shows at Madison Square Garden.
[01:10:15.580 --> 01:10:18.780]   It's his 59th show there.
[01:10:18.780 --> 01:10:19.620]   - Good heaven.
[01:10:19.620 --> 01:10:20.620]   (laughing)
[01:10:20.620 --> 01:10:23.460]   - I mean, this is not sarcastic.
[01:10:23.460 --> 01:10:24.940]   I am so in awe of that.
[01:10:24.940 --> 01:10:27.260]   How do you sell out this huge venue?
[01:10:27.260 --> 01:10:30.060]   And again, you don't have a hit sitcom.
[01:10:30.060 --> 01:10:31.460]   You don't keep making albums.
[01:10:31.460 --> 01:10:33.300]   It's like, this is why I say--
[01:10:33.300 --> 01:10:36.540]   - I think you're also like, your catalog of songs
[01:10:36.540 --> 01:10:37.900]   has to be so strong.
[01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:39.780]   And the show you put together to perform them
[01:10:39.780 --> 01:10:43.260]   has to be so good that that's quite--
[01:10:43.260 --> 01:10:45.020]   - And there's gotta be massive repeat, right?
[01:10:45.020 --> 01:10:47.380]   People go back again and again.
[01:10:47.380 --> 01:10:50.380]   You saw him in January, see him in February.
[01:10:50.380 --> 01:10:52.420]   - Well, but it's also that I think part of it is,
[01:10:52.420 --> 01:10:55.420]   is that the location of Madison Square Garden
[01:10:55.420 --> 01:10:57.220]   is the fact that New York is a huge tour
[01:10:57.220 --> 01:10:59.300]   of Sterea is there's a lot of,
[01:10:59.300 --> 01:11:00.900]   "Hey, we can go and while we're there,"
[01:11:00.900 --> 01:11:02.580]   you know, it's like going to Broadway,
[01:11:02.580 --> 01:11:04.460]   if you don't like Broadway, you go see Billy Joel.
[01:11:04.460 --> 01:11:05.740]   - There's a Billy Joel show.
[01:11:05.740 --> 01:11:06.580]   - Yeah.
[01:11:06.580 --> 01:11:09.100]   - And he's, I saw him in Buffalo, New York.
[01:11:09.100 --> 01:11:09.940]   - Oh, you've seen him?
[01:11:09.940 --> 01:11:10.780]   - Maybe.
[01:11:10.780 --> 01:11:11.620]   - Oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:11:11.620 --> 01:11:14.100]   I saw him in 1991, I think, in Buffalo.
[01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:16.500]   And when I was working for Sony, actually.
[01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:18.620]   So, and he's amazing.
[01:11:18.620 --> 01:11:19.780]   I mean, he really is amazing.
[01:11:19.780 --> 01:11:20.620]   - So there you go.
[01:11:20.620 --> 01:11:23.420]   He's like the Bruce Springsteen of Easy Listening.
[01:11:23.420 --> 01:11:24.260]   (laughing)
[01:11:24.260 --> 01:11:25.100]   - Yes.
[01:11:25.100 --> 01:11:25.940]   (laughing)
[01:11:25.940 --> 01:11:27.340]   - It's a rock and show.
[01:11:27.340 --> 01:11:28.940]   And you think like how can he be entertaining
[01:11:28.940 --> 01:11:30.140]   sitting behind a piano?
[01:11:30.140 --> 01:11:32.900]   I mean, like, but he gets up and even then
[01:11:32.900 --> 01:11:35.140]   he just, it's an incredible amount of energy.
[01:11:35.140 --> 01:11:36.700]   So, he's like a lot more.
[01:11:36.700 --> 01:11:39.260]   - He is still a decade away from his PBS pledge drive special.
[01:11:39.260 --> 01:11:40.100]   That's what we're saying.
[01:11:40.100 --> 01:11:41.780]   (laughing)
[01:11:41.780 --> 01:11:44.100]   Hey, remember the sounds of the 80s
[01:11:44.100 --> 01:11:45.860]   with the tail fins on the cars?
[01:11:45.860 --> 01:11:46.700]   - Well, and the thing is,
[01:11:46.700 --> 01:11:48.820]   is you haven't listened to him on the radio for a long time,
[01:11:48.820 --> 01:11:50.940]   but when he does a concert, he doesn't,
[01:11:50.940 --> 01:11:53.940]   there's no, there's no back tracks.
[01:11:53.940 --> 01:11:56.060]   I mean, there's just, you know, he fills two hours.
[01:11:56.060 --> 01:11:58.060]   - He performs the band is actually playing.
[01:11:58.060 --> 01:11:58.980]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:11:58.980 --> 01:12:01.620]   - Well, no, but it's also like there's no tracks.
[01:12:01.620 --> 01:12:03.700]   I mean, what I mean by that is that there's no deep album
[01:12:03.700 --> 01:12:05.100]   tracks that you're wondering about.
[01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:06.940]   - No, it's all hits all the time.
[01:12:06.940 --> 01:12:09.580]   - It is one hit after another that you know every word
[01:12:09.580 --> 01:12:10.860]   to for every song.
[01:12:10.860 --> 01:12:13.540]   And it does make it, and so the whole crowd's into it.
[01:12:13.540 --> 01:12:14.380]   They all know it.
[01:12:14.380 --> 01:12:16.460]   They, you know, and they, you know, really enjoyed.
[01:12:16.460 --> 01:12:18.060]   I went to one where he was actually
[01:12:18.060 --> 01:12:19.300]   still had a new album, you know?
[01:12:19.300 --> 01:12:21.660]   - Yeah, well, that's how long ago that was.
[01:12:21.660 --> 01:12:22.500]   - Yes, exactly.
[01:12:22.500 --> 01:12:26.860]   - For the kids, he did it with, without any sex tapes
[01:12:26.860 --> 01:12:30.340]   released, and he nude butt photos, he did it on a talent.
[01:12:30.340 --> 01:12:31.340]   - No, they'll kill.
[01:12:31.340 --> 01:12:33.700]   - No, that's how big he is.
[01:12:33.700 --> 01:12:36.700]   That's how big he is.
[01:12:36.700 --> 01:12:38.660]   - That's really interesting.
[01:12:38.660 --> 01:12:41.500]   Actually, ScooterX is putting the results,
[01:12:41.500 --> 01:12:43.140]   how much money he's made.
[01:12:43.140 --> 01:12:45.420]   Oh, I don't have it.
[01:12:45.420 --> 01:12:48.700]   How much money has he made in these tours, ScooterX?
[01:12:48.700 --> 01:12:52.100]   - Well, and when you look at the revenue related
[01:12:52.100 --> 01:12:55.140]   to tours versus albums, he doesn't need to release
[01:12:55.140 --> 01:12:55.980]   another album.
[01:12:55.980 --> 01:12:57.780]   I mean, it's like, you know, the fact
[01:12:57.780 --> 01:13:00.140]   - This is what the kids are doing now, right?
[01:13:00.140 --> 01:13:02.620]   They don't make money on recordings.
[01:13:02.620 --> 01:13:04.820]   They make money on performance.
[01:13:04.820 --> 01:13:07.980]   - Foo Fighters was at Fenway Park, and it's like,
[01:13:07.980 --> 01:13:10.820]   well, for one thing, it was good to see Fenway Park
[01:13:10.820 --> 01:13:12.940]   being used to some sort of productive purpose
[01:13:12.940 --> 01:13:14.300]   this summer and spring.
[01:13:14.300 --> 01:13:15.140]   Let's just say that.
[01:13:15.140 --> 01:13:16.460]   (laughing)
[01:13:16.460 --> 01:13:20.620]   But also, it's like, it's like, it's really, really clear
[01:13:20.620 --> 01:13:22.340]   that this is what they do for a living.
[01:13:22.340 --> 01:13:24.700]   They are a live performance band,
[01:13:24.700 --> 01:13:27.300]   and this they do other projects, yes, they have records,
[01:13:27.300 --> 01:13:29.220]   but it's like, it's not just something
[01:13:29.220 --> 01:13:30.380]   where they load up the vans,
[01:13:30.380 --> 01:13:31.980]   and they just trundle through a bunch of dates.
[01:13:31.980 --> 01:13:34.460]   It is, this is where their creativity is now.
[01:13:34.460 --> 01:13:35.300]   - It's kind of me.
[01:13:35.300 --> 01:13:36.620]   - When you live performance, and so many bands are like that.
[01:13:36.620 --> 01:13:37.460]   - I really like that.
[01:13:37.460 --> 01:13:39.780]   - And you can see that it shifted from
[01:13:39.780 --> 01:13:43.180]   when you're paying $15 a ticket when I was a kid,
[01:13:43.180 --> 01:13:45.460]   because this was PR for the album.
[01:13:45.460 --> 01:13:46.980]   The album was what made money,
[01:13:46.980 --> 01:13:50.460]   and you just wanted to cover the costs of the concert.
[01:13:50.460 --> 01:13:54.020]   And when they shifted to the $100, $200, $300, $500 tickets
[01:13:54.020 --> 01:13:57.020]   is when the concerts became more important.
[01:13:57.020 --> 01:13:58.420]   - You wanna know what the average ticket price
[01:13:58.420 --> 01:14:01.500]   at a Madison Square Garden Billy Joel concert is?
[01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:05.100]   The average is $235.
[01:14:05.100 --> 01:14:06.500]   Per person.
[01:14:06.500 --> 01:14:07.580]   But it's like going a Broadway.
[01:14:07.580 --> 01:14:08.420]   It really is.
[01:14:08.420 --> 01:14:10.300]   It's like, we're gonna go have a good time,
[01:14:10.300 --> 01:14:12.060]   and then we're gonna go see a Billy Joel concert,
[01:14:12.060 --> 01:14:13.500]   which would be very enjoyable.
[01:14:13.500 --> 01:14:16.140]   - But that's even the same thing
[01:14:16.140 --> 01:14:17.300]   as what's happening on Broadway now,
[01:14:17.300 --> 01:14:20.580]   where last time I came close to seeing this,
[01:14:20.580 --> 01:14:22.180]   I used to see Broadway shows all the time.
[01:14:22.180 --> 01:14:25.140]   That's when the ticket prices were about $75 to $90,
[01:14:25.140 --> 01:14:27.380]   and you get half price tickets at the tickets booth
[01:14:27.380 --> 01:14:29.700]   and the Times Square for easily for half that,
[01:14:29.700 --> 01:14:31.140]   like 35 bucks.
[01:14:31.140 --> 01:14:32.540]   And for 35 to 40 bucks,
[01:14:32.540 --> 01:14:34.700]   I will take a chance on stuff that I haven't seen before.
[01:14:34.700 --> 01:14:37.900]   I would search online, look at the playbill,
[01:14:37.900 --> 01:14:41.180]   say I like that actor, I like that actor's experience.
[01:14:41.180 --> 01:14:42.300]   I've never heard of this play before,
[01:14:42.300 --> 01:14:43.300]   but I will go see it.
[01:14:43.300 --> 01:14:46.460]   Last time I went, I almost, I wanted to see,
[01:14:46.460 --> 01:14:49.980]   I wanna see, I think it was the man who came to dinner,
[01:14:49.980 --> 01:14:53.460]   or I'm sorry, you can't take it with you,
[01:14:53.460 --> 01:14:54.580]   which I've never seen live,
[01:14:54.580 --> 01:14:56.220]   and I've always wanted to see live.
[01:14:56.220 --> 01:14:59.740]   And it was the cheap tickets for $120.
[01:14:59.740 --> 01:15:01.900]   And that was for a play that I had heard of,
[01:15:01.900 --> 01:15:03.900]   and I wanted to go see.
[01:15:03.900 --> 01:15:05.780]   This is why you can't be upset
[01:15:05.780 --> 01:15:07.260]   that now you've got, you know,
[01:15:07.260 --> 01:15:09.180]   minions, the Broadway musical,
[01:15:09.180 --> 01:15:11.140]   'cause you have for $230 a ticket,
[01:15:11.140 --> 01:15:12.580]   for $175 a ticket,
[01:15:12.580 --> 01:15:14.020]   you have to be giving them something
[01:15:14.020 --> 01:15:15.220]   where I'm familiar with it,
[01:15:15.220 --> 01:15:17.180]   I know I'm gonna like it because,
[01:15:17.180 --> 01:15:19.620]   for Billy Joel concert,
[01:15:19.620 --> 01:15:22.260]   I can't spend $230 on this ticket unless
[01:15:22.260 --> 01:15:24.820]   I am really certain I'm going to love this.
[01:15:24.820 --> 01:15:26.140]   - How do you use the McDonald's of music?
[01:15:26.140 --> 01:15:28.260]   You know exactly what you're gonna get.
[01:15:28.260 --> 01:15:30.060]   - Oh no, imagine McDonald's
[01:15:30.060 --> 01:15:31.780]   where everything was fresh to order,
[01:15:31.780 --> 01:15:33.700]   and amazing, and this is good.
[01:15:33.700 --> 01:15:34.700]   - I don't mean to,
[01:15:34.700 --> 01:15:36.780]   definitely Joel, I like his music.
[01:15:36.780 --> 01:15:37.780]   - Exactly, exactly.
[01:15:37.780 --> 01:15:40.100]   - I like it better than the Apple Watch anyway.
[01:15:41.060 --> 01:15:43.580]   - What we're all saying is that if you are listening,
[01:15:43.580 --> 01:15:44.740]   Billy Joel or Billy Joel's people,
[01:15:44.740 --> 01:15:46.660]   and you wanna cop us in,
[01:15:46.660 --> 01:15:49.060]   I'm gonna be in New York next month
[01:15:49.060 --> 01:15:49.900]   with some time to go.
[01:15:49.900 --> 01:15:51.460]   - You just get right off the train at Penn Station,
[01:15:51.460 --> 01:15:52.620]   and there you are.
[01:15:52.620 --> 01:15:53.460]   - Here you go.
[01:15:53.460 --> 01:15:55.460]   - Yeah, well music, let me Billy Joel.
[01:15:55.460 --> 01:15:58.140]   - You could get down there from Morial in about,
[01:15:58.140 --> 01:16:00.220]   I don't know, five hours.
[01:16:00.220 --> 01:16:01.300]   You'd be right there.
[01:16:01.300 --> 01:16:04.500]   Depending on the condition of the tracks.
[01:16:04.500 --> 01:16:07.380]   Our show today brought to you by Brudry,
[01:16:07.380 --> 01:16:08.820]   are you a mobile developer?
[01:16:08.820 --> 01:16:12.620]   Oh, you know that one of the keys to success
[01:16:12.620 --> 01:16:17.620]   for a mobile app is a good, strong payments back end.
[01:16:17.620 --> 01:16:19.860]   Do not write it yourself.
[01:16:19.860 --> 01:16:22.460]   I mean, there's so many reasons.
[01:16:22.460 --> 01:16:23.900]   I shouldn't even have to go into it.
[01:16:23.900 --> 01:16:26.820]   The security issues, the reliability issues,
[01:16:26.820 --> 01:16:28.300]   even customer perception.
[01:16:28.300 --> 01:16:31.460]   You know, there's about a 70% rejection rate.
[01:16:31.460 --> 01:16:33.980]   Mobile cart abandonment, they call it.
[01:16:33.980 --> 01:16:35.420]   And I think a lot of that comes from people
[01:16:35.420 --> 01:16:38.260]   just not having the confidence to depress the pay button.
[01:16:39.140 --> 01:16:40.700]   Brain tree solves all that.
[01:16:40.700 --> 01:16:42.980]   That's why Uber uses brain tree.
[01:16:42.980 --> 01:16:45.540]   Uber after all, it's all about the payment.
[01:16:45.540 --> 01:16:48.060]   It's all about how easy it is.
[01:16:48.060 --> 01:16:52.020]   Airbnb uses brain tree, hotel tonight, living social,
[01:16:52.020 --> 01:16:52.860]   munchary.
[01:16:52.860 --> 01:16:55.580]   We talked to the CTO, Brain Tree 1,
[01:16:55.580 --> 01:17:00.580]   but it is about how much developers like using brain tree.
[01:17:00.580 --> 01:17:02.060]   Take a listen.
[01:17:02.060 --> 01:17:04.420]   - When we talk to iOS engineers,
[01:17:04.420 --> 01:17:06.980]   they get really excited by how fast news is
[01:17:06.980 --> 01:17:09.060]   to have Apple pay through brain tree.
[01:17:09.060 --> 01:17:12.740]   Just a ton of feedback from Android developers saying,
[01:17:12.740 --> 01:17:14.540]   "Wow, great, now I can get Android pay."
[01:17:14.540 --> 01:17:16.940]   Then you see people really kind of responding and saying,
[01:17:16.940 --> 01:17:19.460]   "Wow, I can do more than one of these
[01:17:19.460 --> 01:17:23.220]   through one integration, one SDK and one report too.
[01:17:23.220 --> 01:17:25.580]   Wow, that's gonna make my finance guys happy."
[01:17:25.580 --> 01:17:27.580]   - It's gonna make you happy right now.

[01:18:16.860 --> 01:18:20.580]   - Little word of warning to those num nuts
[01:18:20.580 --> 01:18:23.600]   who would go into Apple stores and bend the iPhone 6.
[01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:28.020]   You could hurt yourself with the new iPhone.
[01:18:28.020 --> 01:18:28.860]   - What's up guys?
[01:18:28.860 --> 01:18:30.780]   Lou here back with another video and today--
[01:18:30.780 --> 01:18:32.700]   - Lou's loud. - Yep.
[01:18:32.700 --> 01:18:35.020]   - Lou's a loud man, this unboxed therapy.

[01:32:56.020 --> 01:32:57.020]   you know, have to jump,
[01:32:57.020 --> 01:32:59.020]   you know, have to allow it
[01:32:59.020 --> 01:33:00.020]   because people will make choices
[01:33:00.020 --> 01:33:02.020]   and the people who have, you know,
[01:33:02.020 --> 01:33:04.020]   iPhones, you know,
[01:33:04.020 --> 01:33:06.020]   statistically buy more stuff.
[01:33:06.020 --> 01:33:08.020]   (laughing)
[01:33:08.020 --> 01:33:10.020]   They clearly have lower buying resistance
[01:33:10.020 --> 01:33:12.020]   and more money dispatching.
[01:33:12.020 --> 01:33:13.020]   - Yeah, I'll take two.
[01:33:13.020 --> 01:33:14.020]   - It's a self-selecting thing.
[01:33:14.020 --> 01:33:15.020]   - You got me Apple watches?
[01:33:15.020 --> 01:33:16.020]   I'll buy that too.
[01:33:16.020 --> 01:33:18.020]   - August 15th,
[01:33:18.020 --> 01:33:21.020]   don't run into a right aid today.
[01:33:21.020 --> 01:33:22.020]   They don't have it yet.
[01:33:22.020 --> 01:33:23.020]   So August 15th,
[01:33:23.020 --> 01:33:24.020]   they're gonna roll that out.
[01:33:24.020 --> 01:33:25.020]   I have to think that also has
[01:33:25.020 --> 01:33:30.020]   something to do with a lack of
[01:33:30.020 --> 01:33:33.020]   any currency ability to pay yet
[01:33:33.020 --> 01:33:35.020]   and like it hasn't rolled out.
[01:33:35.020 --> 01:33:36.020]   - No, it's been forever.
[01:33:36.020 --> 01:33:37.020]   - So at some point you go,
[01:33:37.020 --> 01:33:38.020]   okay, screw it,
[01:33:38.020 --> 01:33:39.020]   we're just gonna go with Apple Pay.
[01:33:39.020 --> 01:33:41.020]   - It's the implementation was also like,
[01:33:41.020 --> 01:33:42.020]   not all the implementations,
[01:33:42.020 --> 01:33:43.020]   but the one that got the marginal.
[01:33:43.020 --> 01:33:44.020]   - It's so marble.
[01:33:44.020 --> 01:33:45.020]   - The one where you had to either
[01:33:45.020 --> 01:33:46.020]   present or scan a QV.
[01:33:46.020 --> 01:33:48.020]   It was entirely built so that Walmart
[01:33:48.020 --> 01:33:50.020]   and their friends would not have to pay credit card fees.
[01:33:50.020 --> 01:33:52.020]   It was not built to make customer lives easier,
[01:33:52.020 --> 01:33:54.020]   transactions more secure and more private.
[01:33:54.020 --> 01:33:56.020]   And that's the sort of thing that Apple Pay
[01:33:56.020 --> 01:33:57.020]   and Google while they are doing.
[01:33:57.020 --> 01:33:58.020]   So those are just better services,
[01:33:58.020 --> 01:34:00.020]   better done, better realized.
[01:34:00.020 --> 01:34:01.020]   - Yeah, not only that,
[01:34:01.020 --> 01:34:02.020]   but collecting personal,
[01:34:02.020 --> 01:34:04.020]   privatized, private user information,
[01:34:04.020 --> 01:34:07.020]   consumer information that they can then apply
[01:34:07.020 --> 01:34:08.020]   from store to store to store,
[01:34:08.020 --> 01:34:10.020]   brand to brand to brand.
[01:34:10.020 --> 01:34:12.020]   That was, there's so many deal breakers
[01:34:12.020 --> 01:34:13.020]   with currency that, I mean,
[01:34:13.020 --> 01:34:17.020]   I took the, it's rare that I wind up telling people
[01:34:17.020 --> 01:34:20.020]   about a product that has not shipped yet.
[01:34:20.020 --> 01:34:23.020]   Expect that you should not use this.
[01:34:23.020 --> 01:34:25.020]   Expect that you should never sign up for this.
[01:34:25.020 --> 01:34:27.020]   Expect that you should not even experiment
[01:34:27.020 --> 01:34:29.020]   with this even temporarily because
[01:34:29.020 --> 01:34:31.020]   everything I've seen about this so far
[01:34:31.020 --> 01:34:34.020]   is just such a huge red flag that I kind of
[01:34:34.020 --> 01:34:37.020]   don't want to be tied into the same water
[01:34:37.020 --> 01:34:40.020]   and sewage system that currency is also tied into
[01:34:40.020 --> 01:34:42.020]   because at some point my faucets
[01:34:42.020 --> 01:34:44.020]   were are going to be bleeding out methane gas
[01:34:44.020 --> 01:34:46.020]   because it's just terrible.
[01:34:46.020 --> 01:34:48.020]   - Unless you're bank account number,
[01:34:48.020 --> 01:34:50.020]   you can trust us, we promise.
[01:34:50.020 --> 01:34:51.020]   - We've never had a reach.
[01:34:51.020 --> 01:34:54.020]   - Again, it's the fact that Apple doesn't have,
[01:34:54.020 --> 01:34:58.020]   you know, their game is to make it really easy
[01:34:58.020 --> 01:35:01.020]   to use their product and to use their services.
[01:35:01.020 --> 01:35:03.020]   You know, they're not trying to sell you ads
[01:35:03.020 --> 01:35:05.020]   and not trying to sell you more detergent.
[01:35:05.020 --> 01:35:06.020]   They're not trying to, you know,
[01:35:06.020 --> 01:35:08.020]   they're trying to make it, you know,
[01:35:08.020 --> 01:35:10.020]   they're distinguish themselves and make it easier
[01:35:10.020 --> 01:35:13.020]   and I think that for a lot of people that feels less achy.
[01:35:13.020 --> 01:35:16.020]   - Alex, if you decided if you're going to make the
[01:35:16.020 --> 01:35:19.020]   DX01 your pick of the week or not?
[01:35:19.020 --> 01:35:21.020]   - I'm not going to do it this week.
[01:35:21.020 --> 01:35:22.020]   I'm still testing.
[01:35:22.020 --> 01:35:24.020]   - Okay, can we show some pictures?
[01:35:24.020 --> 01:35:25.020]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[01:35:25.020 --> 01:35:27.020]   - I mean, we could talk a little bit about it now
[01:35:27.020 --> 01:35:29.020]   and then you could save it and give us your review next week.
[01:35:29.020 --> 01:35:30.020]   - Yeah, okay.
[01:35:30.020 --> 01:35:34.020]   - So the idea is this plugs in just by the thunderbolt port
[01:35:34.020 --> 01:35:36.020]   right into your iPhone and I presume the pictures
[01:35:36.020 --> 01:35:39.020]   on your Facebook page are, by the way,
[01:35:39.020 --> 01:35:41.020]   with the DX01, right?
[01:35:41.020 --> 01:35:42.020]   - Yeah, they're all DX01.
[01:35:42.020 --> 01:35:44.020]   - This whole travel blog was just an excuse
[01:35:44.020 --> 01:35:46.020]   to mess with the DX01.
[01:35:46.020 --> 01:35:48.020]   - Well, no, I mean, I do this.
[01:35:48.020 --> 01:35:51.020]   I post a lot more photos on Twitter or Facebook
[01:35:51.020 --> 01:35:54.020]   or other things every time I come to Rwanda.
[01:35:54.020 --> 01:35:57.020]   It's something that I, you know, it's a time when I'm not as
[01:35:57.020 --> 01:35:58.020]   - Right.
[01:35:58.020 --> 01:35:59.020]   - Restricted.
[01:35:59.020 --> 01:36:00.020]   - Me too, yeah.
[01:36:00.020 --> 01:36:01.020]   Well, yeah, not that I have restrictions,
[01:36:01.020 --> 01:36:03.020]   but you also have some, you're sitting in an airport lounge
[01:36:03.020 --> 01:36:05.020]   here, it's not much else to do.
[01:36:05.020 --> 01:36:06.020]   - It gives me something to do.
[01:36:06.020 --> 01:36:07.020]   It's kind of fun.
[01:36:07.020 --> 01:36:10.020]   I show things and talk about, you know, my things.
[01:36:10.020 --> 01:36:12.020]   But, you know, here you can see this is all candlelight,
[01:36:12.020 --> 01:36:14.020]   so that's a good moment for me.
[01:36:14.020 --> 01:36:15.020]   - This is pretty good.
[01:36:15.020 --> 01:36:16.020]   - Yeah, this is amazing.
[01:36:16.020 --> 01:36:19.020]   And it's heavily scrunched by Facebook too, so,
[01:36:19.020 --> 01:36:22.020]   I mean, this isn't going to be the best.
[01:36:22.020 --> 01:36:24.020]   You should put it on, you know, somewhere where they don't
[01:36:24.020 --> 01:36:25.020]   - Compressive.
[01:36:25.020 --> 01:36:26.020]   - When I do that, yeah, when I do a more of a review,
[01:36:26.020 --> 01:36:29.020]   you know, I can - The detail looks really good, I have to say.
[01:36:29.020 --> 01:36:30.020]   - I'm looking at this.
[01:36:30.020 --> 01:36:32.020]   - I'm really looking forward to your review.
[01:36:32.020 --> 01:36:34.020]   I don't have one yet.
[01:36:34.020 --> 01:36:36.020]   And it's a nice freaking idea.
[01:36:36.020 --> 01:36:37.020]   - It's pretty quick.
[01:36:37.020 --> 01:36:39.020]   - It's kind of like the story I told about the, about the,
[01:36:39.020 --> 01:36:42.020]   about the Concord, that there have to be a lot of people
[01:36:42.020 --> 01:36:45.020]   who, for whom compactness is such a huge deal that the one who
[01:36:45.020 --> 01:36:48.020]   has $600 for a camera that costs as much as
[01:36:48.020 --> 01:36:51.020]   - Clearly Alex cares about compactness.
[01:36:51.020 --> 01:36:54.020]   - But, but, you know, we have great pictures.
[01:36:54.020 --> 01:36:55.020]   - Yeah.
[01:36:55.020 --> 01:36:57.020]   - Here's his luggage cart.
[01:36:57.020 --> 01:36:59.020]   Was this your carry on?
[01:36:59.020 --> 01:37:01.020]   - The carry on is on the top there.
[01:37:01.020 --> 01:37:05.020]   The rest of it always, yeah, the rest of it was the pack.
[01:37:05.020 --> 01:37:07.020]   - So, these cameras.
[01:37:07.020 --> 01:37:09.020]   - Yeah, these, what is it?
[01:37:09.020 --> 01:37:10.020]   Penguin cases?
[01:37:10.020 --> 01:37:11.020]   What do you use?
[01:37:11.020 --> 01:37:12.020]   Pelican cases.
[01:37:12.020 --> 01:37:13.020]   - Pelican cases.
[01:37:13.020 --> 01:37:14.020]   - They must love you.
[01:37:14.020 --> 01:37:15.020]   - Pelican cases.
[01:37:15.020 --> 01:37:18.020]   - Yeah, they, there's a lot of groans when I show up.
[01:37:18.020 --> 01:37:20.020]   Cause I, we, we're pretty surgical about our stuff.
[01:37:20.020 --> 01:37:23.020]   And here, you can see the, the larger sensor there, you know,
[01:37:23.020 --> 01:37:26.020]   you're taking a picture there and it's a pretty short depth of field.
[01:37:26.020 --> 01:37:27.020]   - Yeah.
[01:37:27.020 --> 01:37:28.020]   - So, you know, you're, you're taking, you're pretty close.
[01:37:28.020 --> 01:37:29.020]   - You're pretty close.
[01:37:29.020 --> 01:37:30.020]   Are you pretty close at this point?
[01:37:30.020 --> 01:37:32.020]   - You know, I'm sitting, I'm just.
[01:37:32.020 --> 01:37:35.020]   - So it has a fairly close focal point, like a foot, maybe?
[01:37:35.020 --> 01:37:36.020]   - Yeah.
[01:37:36.020 --> 01:37:37.020]   - Get right in there.
[01:37:37.020 --> 01:37:40.020]   - Exactly what it is, but it's, it's, but it's, you know, it, it is,
[01:37:40.020 --> 01:37:45.020]   I, yeah, I travel a lot.
[01:37:45.020 --> 01:37:46.020]   I, I just stopped taking an SLR.
[01:37:46.020 --> 01:37:48.020]   I try to four thirds and I stopped taking that.
[01:37:48.020 --> 01:37:50.020]   You know, it's just, I have so much stuff.
[01:37:50.020 --> 01:37:51.020]   - It's so nice.
[01:37:51.020 --> 01:37:54.020]   - If you've ever picked up my, my backpack, I mean, I have a lot of stuff in it.
[01:37:54.020 --> 01:37:56.020]   And I don't want to add another large camera.
[01:37:56.020 --> 01:37:59.020]   And so being able to put something in my front pocket that's going to turn my camera
[01:37:59.020 --> 01:38:01.020]   into something that's going to create images that I actually want to use.
[01:38:01.020 --> 01:38:02.020]   That's the test.
[01:38:02.020 --> 01:38:05.020]   So that's what, you know, we're kind of, kind of fiddling with right now.
[01:38:05.020 --> 01:38:06.020]   - Yeah.
[01:38:06.020 --> 01:38:08.020]   - And this is the, this is the, on the other side of this, this is the Turkish Airlines.
[01:38:08.020 --> 01:38:09.020]   - Very.
[01:38:09.020 --> 01:38:10.020]   - Very nice.
[01:38:10.020 --> 01:38:11.020]   - The Starlight's Loud.
[01:38:11.020 --> 01:38:12.020]   - Yeah, very nice.
[01:38:12.020 --> 01:38:14.020]   - In the, yeah, so far.
[01:38:14.020 --> 01:38:16.020]   - Nice to know the one I was in it as a Turk.
[01:38:16.020 --> 01:38:18.020]   I can tell you that right now.
[01:38:18.020 --> 01:38:22.020]   - But you can see it, you know, just, they're really nice images for, I would say midway
[01:38:22.020 --> 01:38:24.020]   between a point and shooting an SLR.
[01:38:24.020 --> 01:38:25.020]   I mean, it's not.
[01:38:25.020 --> 01:38:26.020]   - Mm hmm.
[01:38:26.020 --> 01:38:27.020]   - Yeah.
[01:38:27.020 --> 01:38:28.020]   - It's hard to tell.
[01:38:28.020 --> 01:38:29.020]   It's Facebook and all but.
[01:38:29.020 --> 01:38:30.020]   - Right.
[01:38:30.020 --> 01:38:31.020]   - Right.
[01:38:31.020 --> 01:38:34.020]   - I gotta say, I think the first choice you have to make when your selected camera is, is this something
[01:38:34.020 --> 01:38:37.020]   that I'm willing to carry with me even when I have no intention of taking pictures?
[01:38:37.020 --> 01:38:38.020]   - Right.
[01:38:38.020 --> 01:38:40.020]   - That's the, that's almost the most important thing you can ask.
[01:38:40.020 --> 01:38:42.020]   - By the way, this was a very useful tip Alex.
[01:38:42.020 --> 01:38:43.020]   I never thought of this.
[01:38:43.020 --> 01:38:49.020]   He takes a picture of his luggage tags in case he loses the luggage tags.
[01:38:49.020 --> 01:38:50.020]   - And they'll scan it.
[01:38:50.020 --> 01:38:51.020]   You can actually zoom up on that.
[01:38:51.020 --> 01:38:52.020]   - Yeah.
[01:38:52.020 --> 01:38:53.020]   - And they'll scan it when you're bagging.
[01:38:53.020 --> 01:38:54.020]   - That's good enough.
[01:38:54.020 --> 01:38:55.020]   - And they'll play where it is and it's.
[01:38:55.020 --> 01:38:58.020]   - Although I have to admit, I've never been to an airport in the last two years that ever,
[01:38:58.020 --> 01:39:00.020]   I, nobody's looked at these in years.
[01:39:00.020 --> 01:39:02.020]   - How I get a lot to do it.
[01:39:02.020 --> 01:39:04.020]   - But when you lose your bag, they look at them.
[01:39:04.020 --> 01:39:05.020]   - Oh, when you lose your bag.
[01:39:05.020 --> 01:39:06.020]   - Yeah.
[01:39:06.020 --> 01:39:07.020]   - Yeah.
[01:39:07.020 --> 01:39:11.020]   - So, didn't they used to like check as you were leaving the airport?
[01:39:11.020 --> 01:39:12.020]   They would compare.
[01:39:12.020 --> 01:39:13.020]   I remember that happening.
[01:39:13.020 --> 01:39:14.020]   - Oh, yeah.
[01:39:14.020 --> 01:39:15.580]   They did that in some countries.
[01:39:15.580 --> 01:39:16.580]   There's a handful of countries.
[01:39:16.580 --> 01:39:19.420]   Johannesburg does that a little bit and a couple other ones.
[01:39:19.420 --> 01:39:24.460]   But for the most part, the big thing is you need those if you lose your bag.
[01:39:24.460 --> 01:39:29.820]   That's where you think that they have it tied to your, you know, and they probably,
[01:39:29.820 --> 01:39:32.300]   somehow, but it's always way faster if you have those tags.
[01:39:32.300 --> 01:39:36.420]   You know, and so, and I'm really, I'm one of the, I mean, we put a lot of stuff in our
[01:39:36.420 --> 01:39:37.420]   bags.
[01:39:37.420 --> 01:39:40.420]   And so, I make sure that they use both of the little stickers and they put it on.
[01:39:40.420 --> 01:39:44.420]   - This is probably, I'm sure, 10, 20 grand in that big, bellicking case.
[01:39:44.420 --> 01:39:47.420]   - More, more video equipment.
[01:39:47.420 --> 01:39:50.420]   - That's three PTZ cameras and a controller.
[01:39:50.420 --> 01:39:53.420]   So, it was, it was a lot of, a lot of gear.
[01:39:53.420 --> 01:39:58.420]   - I like how you're doing before and after pictures of the luggage carts in both airports.
[01:39:58.420 --> 01:40:03.420]   - So, so, I'm really in the luggage carts because, uh, they are your life.
[01:40:03.420 --> 01:40:07.420]   You know, I spent a lot of time putting a lot of stuff on luggage carts.
[01:40:07.420 --> 01:40:09.420]   And, um, I mean, I'll show you some pictures sometime.
[01:40:09.420 --> 01:40:11.420]   And some of the stuff, I mean, we pile them really high.
[01:40:11.420 --> 01:40:14.420]   We get straps to strap them to the luggage carts.
[01:40:14.420 --> 01:40:16.420]   And we'll have them stacked higher than us.
[01:40:16.420 --> 01:40:20.420]   I mean, you can get, if you, if you're concentrated on two luggage carts that you can push yourself,
[01:40:20.420 --> 01:40:23.420]   you can get 14 to 15 of those pelican cases up there, you know.
[01:40:23.420 --> 01:40:27.420]   And so, but it's, it's like a Tetris thing to get it all working.
[01:40:27.420 --> 01:40:30.420]   You know, and so, but, but there are very important things about this.
[01:40:30.420 --> 01:40:35.420]   So, so, you know, that not having a lip, so like Pittsburgh's and a couple other, um, you know,
[01:40:35.420 --> 01:40:40.420]   like, I think New York have a lip on the front of the, of the luggage rack, which you can't hang.
[01:40:40.420 --> 01:40:41.420]   Oh, it's horrible.
[01:40:41.420 --> 01:40:43.420]   - That limits the size of the bag you could put on there.
[01:40:43.420 --> 01:40:45.420]   - Oh, and you're just like, really?
[01:40:45.420 --> 01:40:49.420]   And anyway, so they, um, - By the way, normal people like the lip.
[01:40:49.420 --> 01:40:53.420]   - I don't, I don't even know if they're falling off. - They just don't.
[01:40:53.420 --> 01:40:56.420]   - They're already leaning back.
[01:40:56.420 --> 01:40:57.420]   You're not, you know, it's not going to fall forward.
[01:40:57.420 --> 01:41:03.420]   Anyway, so it's, so anyway, uh, so I, I, I, I'm experimenting with the idea of just kind of
[01:41:03.420 --> 01:41:07.420]   blogging about travel and I talk about little tips and tricks and things that I'm doing.
[01:41:07.420 --> 01:41:09.420]   - And do more of an having fun with them.
[01:41:09.420 --> 01:41:10.420]   - Yeah.
[01:41:10.420 --> 01:41:12.420]   - So, um, - These are the worst seats I've ever seen.
[01:41:12.420 --> 01:41:15.420]   United has these seats now on the domestic flights.
[01:41:15.420 --> 01:41:16.420]   - Oh my gosh, terrible.
[01:41:16.420 --> 01:41:18.420]   - Oh, and it's okay.
[01:41:18.420 --> 01:41:20.420]   This was only a one hour flight, so it wasn't that bad.
[01:41:20.420 --> 01:41:21.420]   - That's about it.
[01:41:21.420 --> 01:41:24.420]   - You do cross continental in those chairs and you cannot get up.
[01:41:24.420 --> 01:41:28.420]   - You know, like it's, and I thought for a while it was only in the short ones.
[01:41:28.420 --> 01:41:32.420]   This was to be, after I bought it, I realized I hadn't gotten the right adapter.
[01:41:32.420 --> 01:41:39.420]   And so I was like, why, why didn't they just leave the, why didn't they just leave the plug as a regular USB
[01:41:39.420 --> 01:41:43.420]   and then, cause it's the same power, you know, output.
[01:41:43.420 --> 01:41:48.420]   Just leave it as a regular USB and then the cable that I get is the regular USB to, to, to, to USB C.
[01:41:48.420 --> 01:41:49.420]   - To USB C.
[01:41:49.420 --> 01:41:50.420]   - Yeah.
[01:41:50.420 --> 01:41:52.420]   - But instead you have to have some special dang thing.
[01:41:52.420 --> 01:41:53.420]   - I agree.
[01:41:53.420 --> 01:41:54.420]   - I agree.
[01:41:54.420 --> 01:41:55.420]   I'm with you.
[01:41:55.420 --> 01:41:56.420]   - Nice shoes.
[01:41:56.420 --> 01:41:57.420]   - Man, that's funny shoes.
[01:41:57.420 --> 01:41:58.420]   - They're also USB C.
[01:41:58.420 --> 01:42:00.420]   - And here's a drone.
[01:42:00.420 --> 01:42:03.420]   - But, but I took, yeah.
[01:42:03.420 --> 01:42:05.420]   Now, now you're not, you're no longer in the trip.
[01:42:05.420 --> 01:42:07.420]   - This is the no longer on the trip, my friends.
[01:42:07.420 --> 01:42:11.420]   - Yeah, this is just me taking, that was, that was in the last trip.
[01:42:11.420 --> 01:42:14.420]   You can see that I don't take a lot of photos between the times I'm in Rwanda.
[01:42:14.420 --> 01:42:18.420]   So, so this is, this is from my, I think my last trip in Rwanda.
[01:42:18.420 --> 01:42:20.420]   This big, I shot a big pilot.
[01:42:20.420 --> 01:42:23.420]   - So, on Facebook are you public and people follow you?
[01:42:23.420 --> 01:42:24.420]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:42:24.420 --> 01:42:25.420]   - With being a friend.
[01:42:25.420 --> 01:42:26.420]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:42:26.420 --> 01:42:27.420]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:42:27.420 --> 01:42:31.300]   I'm public and those are all public posts and people can see those images for themselves.
[01:42:31.300 --> 01:42:33.420]   Is it at Facebook.com/AlexLindsay?
[01:42:33.420 --> 01:42:35.420]   - I think it's Alex B. Lindsay.
[01:42:35.420 --> 01:42:36.420]   - Alex B.
[01:42:36.420 --> 01:42:38.420]   - 'Cause someone else has Alex Lindsey.
[01:42:38.420 --> 01:42:39.420]   - Alex Lindsey.
[01:42:39.420 --> 01:42:40.420]   - Some bastard and also named Alex Lindsay.
[01:42:40.420 --> 01:42:43.420]   - There's a guy in Australia that, some guy in Australia beats me every single time.
[01:42:43.420 --> 01:42:46.420]   - He's awake 16 hours earlier.
[01:42:46.420 --> 01:42:47.420]   - All right.
[01:42:47.420 --> 01:42:48.420]   Gentlemen, ready?
[01:42:48.420 --> 01:42:49.420]   Go ahead, Annie.
[01:42:49.420 --> 01:42:50.420]   - Good.
[01:42:50.420 --> 01:42:52.420]   - You'll save our friend for a lengthy jail term.
[01:42:52.420 --> 01:42:53.420]   Burn the video.
[01:42:53.420 --> 01:42:54.420]   - Secure.
[01:42:54.420 --> 01:42:55.420]   - It's secure.
[01:42:55.420 --> 01:42:57.420]   - We'll get a special call late at night.
[01:42:57.420 --> 01:42:58.420]   - Burn the video.
[01:42:58.420 --> 01:42:59.420]   - I wear a magnet.
[01:42:59.420 --> 01:43:05.420]   - I got, I got a, I'm sorry, we'll go to pics of the week, but do you just maybe think, I have to know at some point, you'll see our friend for a lengthy jail term.
[01:43:05.420 --> 01:43:06.420]   Burn the video.
[01:43:06.420 --> 01:43:07.420]   - Secure.
[01:43:07.420 --> 01:43:08.420]   - Secure.
[01:43:08.420 --> 01:43:10.420]   - We'll get a special call late at night.
[01:43:10.420 --> 01:43:11.420]   - Burn the video.
[01:43:11.420 --> 01:43:13.420]   - I wear a magnet.
[01:43:13.420 --> 01:43:26.420]   - I got, I got a, I'm sorry, we'll go to pics of the week, but do you just maybe think, I have to know at some point in the future, not today, I have to know what Alex Lindsay's go bag looks like, the one that he grabs when he needs to run someplace.
[01:43:26.420 --> 01:43:27.420]   - I love it.
[01:43:27.420 --> 01:43:29.420]   - That's got to be something fantastic.
[01:43:29.420 --> 01:43:31.420]   - I will, I will post my bags.
[01:43:31.420 --> 01:43:33.420]   So I'll show, show up my bag.
[01:43:33.420 --> 01:43:34.420]   - I'll get the four bags.
[01:43:34.420 --> 01:43:36.420]   - There's a knock at the front door.
[01:43:36.420 --> 01:43:38.420]   You know you got to leave by the back door.
[01:43:38.420 --> 01:43:39.420]   You can only grab some.
[01:43:39.420 --> 01:43:42.420]   - If the president, you don't press any orders using your real name again.
[01:43:42.420 --> 01:43:54.420]   - We, we, most of our guys have instructions to have one, so not to get out of way, get out of trouble, but mostly just because we call them and say you have four hours to be in an airport to go to, you know, Turkey or something like that to do in an event.
[01:43:54.420 --> 01:43:59.420]   So, but, you know, I'll post my, my, my bags are pretty small.
[01:43:59.420 --> 01:44:01.420]   I don't, I don't like to check bags unless it's gear.
[01:44:01.420 --> 01:44:03.420]   So I really only check Pelican cases.
[01:44:03.420 --> 01:44:04.420]   So.
[01:44:04.420 --> 01:44:08.420]   - Our show today brought to you by Pelican cases.
[01:44:08.420 --> 01:44:10.420]   We should actually, can we talk to them?
[01:44:10.420 --> 01:44:11.420]   I think we should.
[01:44:11.420 --> 01:44:12.420]   - My carry on is a privilege.
[01:44:12.420 --> 01:44:15.420]   - I wish I would love Pelican cases as a sponsor.
[01:44:15.420 --> 01:44:16.420]   - I would too.
[01:44:16.420 --> 01:44:17.420]   - I don't know how many.
[01:44:17.420 --> 01:44:20.420]   - I think I have 60 or 70 of those things downstairs.
[01:44:20.420 --> 01:44:28.420]   - Actually, in point of reality, we are sponsoring Pelican case with our, with our heart dollars.

[01:45:39.420 --> 01:45:42.420]   see what it would look like with your stuff.
[01:45:42.420 --> 01:45:47.420]   Even though these are templates and some gorgeous designer templates, each Squarespace site is
[01:45:47.420 --> 01:45:48.420]   unique.
[01:45:48.420 --> 01:45:52.420]   In fact, if you look at the template, you'll see a variety of real sites using that template.
[01:45:52.420 --> 01:45:57.420]   You'll see they all look different because Squarespace makes it so easy to customize.
[01:45:57.420 --> 01:46:00.420]   So, see, these are all the same template, but they're all different.
[01:46:00.420 --> 01:46:03.420]   Very visual in every respect, I gotta say.
[01:46:03.420 --> 01:46:05.420]   Go to squarespace.com.
[01:46:05.420 --> 01:46:11.420]   We're talking hosting and software combined meshed to give you and your users the best
[01:46:11.420 --> 01:46:12.420]   experience.

[01:46:16.420 --> 01:46:19.420]   need to buy or even give them a credit card if you want to try it.

[01:46:34.420 --> 01:46:36.420]   product.com.
[01:46:36.420 --> 01:46:38.420]   It's called it beautiful.
[01:46:38.420 --> 01:46:41.420]   So gorgeous squarespace.com.
[01:46:41.420 --> 01:46:46.420]   We always talk about the behind the scenes techie stuff of Squarespace, but really, it's
[01:46:46.420 --> 01:46:49.420]   aesthetically so satisfying, so pleasing.
[01:46:49.420 --> 01:46:50.420]   Let's get your pick of the week.
[01:46:50.420 --> 01:46:55.420]   We'll start over here on my right, Renee Richie from iMore.com.
[01:46:55.420 --> 01:46:56.420]   So I just got this.
[01:46:56.420 --> 01:46:58.420]   This is an iHome plug.
[01:46:58.420 --> 01:47:01.420]   And while it looks just like a plug, it actually is compatible with HomeKit, which means once
[01:47:01.420 --> 01:47:05.420]   you plug into it, you can turn on and off with your iPhone.
[01:47:05.420 --> 01:47:09.420]   And that might not sound like much until you realize that once you have HomeKit set up,
[01:47:09.420 --> 01:47:14.420]   everything that you put together can all be controlled all at one time with either the
[01:47:14.420 --> 01:47:16.420]   apps, but most excitedly with Siri.
[01:47:16.420 --> 01:47:20.420]   As Renee called it a really good demo of this a couple of shows ago, but you can just say,
[01:47:20.420 --> 01:47:24.420]   you know, turn on the fan, turn off the fan, turn on that light, turn off that light,
[01:47:24.420 --> 01:47:30.420]   and you can set up a variety of different situations where you have sort of groups set up under
[01:47:30.420 --> 01:47:31.420]   the game.
[01:47:31.420 --> 01:47:35.420]   So you could say, like I did earlier, enable game mode or good night, and then it'll just
[01:47:35.420 --> 01:47:38.420]   turn off everything that can be turned off in the house.
[01:47:38.420 --> 01:47:41.420]   You don't have to worry about getting up and crossing there and making sure the lights
[01:47:41.420 --> 01:47:42.420]   are off in the garage.
[01:47:42.420 --> 01:47:47.420]   I saw a demo of this at CES and they had it hooked up to a fan, and they would just say,
[01:47:47.420 --> 01:47:49.420]   "Siri, turn the fan on, Siri, turn the fan off."
[01:47:49.420 --> 01:47:52.420]   And it worked remarkably well, and that was back in January.
[01:47:52.420 --> 01:47:56.420]   Since then, they've been doing a lot to make the security better, especially a lot of
[01:47:56.420 --> 01:48:01.420]   Wi-Fi chipsets weren't that secure, and Apple is using, is transiting passwords over the
[01:48:01.420 --> 01:48:05.420]   network because they want to make it super easy to use, so it had to be really secure.
[01:48:05.420 --> 01:48:08.420]   And when you look at stories about like cars getting hijacked, I don't want someone sitting
[01:48:08.420 --> 01:48:13.420]   outside of my house and getting into my network and turning my things on and off or opening
[01:48:13.420 --> 01:48:14.420]   locks or stuff like that.
[01:48:14.420 --> 01:48:18.420]   So once you start seeing the new Google and Apple products, sort of like CarPlay and Android
[01:48:18.420 --> 01:48:23.420]   Auto, but for the home, to me, this is just a better way of implementing and doing it because
[01:48:23.420 --> 01:48:26.420]   it's integrated together, works off a common interface, is secure.
[01:48:26.420 --> 01:48:29.420]   You don't have to worry about adding big holes to your network.
[01:48:29.420 --> 01:48:31.420]   And I've got a couple of these now.
[01:48:31.420 --> 01:48:36.420]   I'm going to be trying them out, but the big problem at first is not a lot of people include
[01:48:36.420 --> 01:48:40.420]   the stuff in their products, and with the plug, while it looks goofy, it just means that
[01:48:40.420 --> 01:48:43.420]   anything you plug into it suddenly becomes part of your home kit network.
[01:48:43.420 --> 01:48:46.420]   So I'm going to put a couple of these around the house and try them out, but I'm really
[01:48:46.420 --> 01:48:49.420]   excited to have sort of like the Star Trek reality now.
[01:48:50.420 --> 01:48:54.420]   Really?
[01:48:54.420 --> 01:48:55.420]   That's the Star Trek reality.
[01:48:55.420 --> 01:48:57.420]   No, no, that just was your voice, right?
[01:48:57.420 --> 01:48:58.420]   Computer lights on.
[01:48:58.420 --> 01:49:01.420]   I had to think about that for a moment.
[01:49:01.420 --> 01:49:03.420]   I thought, does this have phasers?
[01:49:03.420 --> 01:49:05.420]   Oh, that would be great.
[01:49:05.420 --> 01:49:11.420]   I mean, if the next iPhone could shoot phasers out of the lightning port, I settle for a
[01:49:11.420 --> 01:49:12.420]   beer.
[01:49:12.420 --> 01:49:13.420]   How much is that, by the way?
[01:49:13.420 --> 01:49:15.420]   I don't know because they just get it to me, but I will look at it.
[01:49:15.420 --> 01:49:16.420]   I don't think they're expensive.
[01:49:16.420 --> 01:49:17.420]   I'm trying to remember.
[01:49:17.420 --> 01:49:18.420]   No.
[01:49:18.420 --> 01:49:19.420]   I don't think they're expensive.
[01:49:19.420 --> 01:49:20.420]   I don't think they're expensive.
[01:49:20.420 --> 01:49:21.420]   I don't think they're expensive.
[01:49:21.420 --> 01:49:22.420]   I don't think they're expensive.
[01:49:22.420 --> 01:49:23.420]   I don't think they're expensive.
[01:49:23.420 --> 01:49:24.420]   I don't think they're expensive.
[01:49:24.420 --> 01:49:25.420]   I don't think they're expensive.
[01:49:25.420 --> 01:49:26.420]   I don't think they're expensive.
[01:49:26.420 --> 01:49:27.420]   I don't think they're expensive.
[01:49:27.420 --> 01:49:28.420]   I don't think they're expensive.
[01:49:28.420 --> 01:49:29.420]   I don't think they're expensive.
[01:49:29.420 --> 01:49:30.420]   I don't think they're expensive.
[01:49:30.420 --> 01:49:31.420]   I don't think they're expensive.
[01:49:31.420 --> 01:49:32.420]   I don't think they're expensive.
[01:49:32.420 --> 01:49:33.420]   I don't think they're expensive.
[01:49:33.420 --> 01:49:34.420]   I don't think they're expensive.
[01:49:34.420 --> 01:49:35.420]   I don't think they're expensive.
[01:49:35.420 --> 01:49:36.420]   I don't think they're expensive.
[01:49:36.420 --> 01:49:37.420]   I don't think they're expensive.
[01:49:37.420 --> 01:49:38.420]   I don't think they're expensive.
[01:49:38.420 --> 01:49:39.420]   I don't think they're expensive.
[01:49:39.420 --> 01:49:40.420]   I don't think they're expensive.
[01:49:41.420 --> 01:49:47.420]   She wanted to play her Dalsomer.
[01:49:47.420 --> 01:49:52.300]   It had been sitting somewhere for maybe 20 years or 15 years.
[01:49:52.300 --> 01:49:56.060]   I had to tune it or figure out how to tune it Dalsomer.
[01:49:56.060 --> 01:49:58.220]   I don't really know how to tune anything.
[01:49:58.220 --> 01:50:03.500]   I went up to, of course, the web and just Google Dalsomers and turns out there's a bunch
[01:50:03.500 --> 01:50:04.500]   of different ways to tune it.
[01:50:04.500 --> 01:50:07.220]   I plucked on it.
[01:50:07.220 --> 01:50:10.900]   I used a program that I just thought was ... I don't know.
[01:50:10.900 --> 01:50:15.460]   I haven't used it a ton, but I just have to say that the fact that I could do this, it's
[01:50:15.460 --> 01:50:19.700]   a program on the iPhone called Pitch Perfect.
[01:50:19.700 --> 01:50:25.540]   It's just a frequency one, but it does a fairly good job of getting the frequencies and telling
[01:50:25.540 --> 01:50:27.900]   you exactly what hurts you're using.
[01:50:27.900 --> 01:50:33.180]   It's just this little guy here.
[01:50:33.180 --> 01:50:34.180]   I tune the Dalsomer.
[01:50:34.180 --> 01:50:35.180]   I just sat there.
[01:50:35.180 --> 01:50:37.580]   I just put the iPhone next to it and I just plucked it and turned it and just watched this
[01:50:37.580 --> 01:50:41.100]   little line move over, closer to the note that I was trying to get to.
[01:50:41.100 --> 01:50:43.700]   When I finished, it sounded great.
[01:50:43.700 --> 01:50:46.260]   It was tuned by a professional.
[01:50:46.260 --> 01:50:48.900]   If you ever need to tune something, it's a dollar or two.
[01:50:48.900 --> 01:50:51.780]   It's not a very expensive app.
[01:50:51.780 --> 01:50:53.740]   It worked very well.
[01:50:53.740 --> 01:50:55.820]   I was just ... There's a whole bunch of them out there.
[01:50:55.820 --> 01:50:58.620]   I bought three or four of them.
[01:50:58.620 --> 01:51:05.140]   This was the only one that I felt really worked very well.
[01:51:05.140 --> 01:51:09.780]   I don't think it has a Dalsomer in there, but I just figured out what the pitches were.
[01:51:09.780 --> 01:51:13.460]   If you actually had one of the instruments in there, it probably would be better.
[01:51:13.460 --> 01:51:14.780]   Anyway, that's Pitch Perfect.
[01:51:14.780 --> 01:51:19.540]   It was a fun experience.
[01:51:19.540 --> 01:51:25.540]   Not the movie, not Pitch Perfect 2, not Pitch Perfect 1, Pitch Perfect the app.
[01:51:25.540 --> 01:51:27.540]   Exactly.
[01:51:27.540 --> 01:51:30.340]   Somebody singing a B flat, we can test it.
[01:51:30.340 --> 01:51:34.340]   Give me a B about Cb.
[01:51:34.340 --> 01:51:40.060]   Mr. Andy Ihannakol, you're pick of the week.
[01:51:40.060 --> 01:51:42.980]   I got a couple of picks that are highly conventional.
[01:51:42.980 --> 01:51:53.380]   It is an anchor Bluetooth keyboard and Anka, economic 2.5 gigahertz wireless mouse, it's
[01:51:53.380 --> 01:51:55.740]   wireless, but not Bluetooth.
[01:51:55.740 --> 01:52:00.060]   It has the key feature that you see in almost everything I've ever bought from Anka, which
[01:52:00.060 --> 01:52:04.180]   is cost damn near next to nothing compared to the alternatives.
[01:52:04.180 --> 01:52:09.100]   It's about 90 to 95% as well made and as useful.
[01:52:09.100 --> 01:52:14.220]   The keyboard costs 25 bucks and is a full-sized keyboard that is as comfortable to use as
[01:52:14.220 --> 01:52:19.980]   pretty much any other keyboard that I've used that has these notebook style keys.
[01:52:19.980 --> 01:52:21.580]   Bluetooth works great.
[01:52:21.580 --> 01:52:28.140]   The mouse costs all of 10 bucks and it's so good that pretty much I'm replacing wired
[01:52:28.140 --> 01:52:34.460]   mouse that I have inside my house with these replacing compact fluorescent bulbs with LED
[01:52:34.460 --> 01:52:40.300]   bulbs because they're 10 bucks you may as well get those cables out of your way.
[01:52:40.300 --> 01:52:45.100]   Whereas the mouse is, there's really no complaints I can possibly make about it.
[01:52:45.100 --> 01:52:49.340]   It's got multiple buttons, it's got a clickable squirrel wheel, it has selectable DPI.
[01:52:49.340 --> 01:52:53.460]   If you want to go from high DPI to low DPI, you can just tap a button in order to do
[01:52:53.460 --> 01:52:58.220]   it, runs off to easy to find AA batteries, don't need to recharge it.
[01:52:58.220 --> 01:53:04.380]   The only complaint about this is that I wish that the bed were a little bit stronger as
[01:53:04.380 --> 01:53:06.500]   you can see, you can put some flex into it.
[01:53:06.500 --> 01:53:08.540]   How many times have I said that?
[01:53:08.540 --> 01:53:09.540]   Ayo.
[01:53:09.540 --> 01:53:12.020]   You can put some flex into it.
[01:53:12.020 --> 01:53:17.260]   Now it lays flat on the desktop, but it means that it's something to at least consider
[01:53:17.260 --> 01:53:22.940]   if you're buying something to be part of a mobile kit for your iPad or your phone.
[01:53:22.940 --> 01:53:29.700]   I've talked about foldable and miniature keyboards in Pixel Week in the past, but I think that
[01:53:29.700 --> 01:53:33.340]   if you really are going to be writing, writing, writing, working, working, working on your
[01:53:33.340 --> 01:53:37.820]   phone or an iPad, there is nothing that can substitute for a full-sized keyboard.
[01:53:37.820 --> 01:53:41.780]   That's the difference between actually being productive and kind of limping along with
[01:53:41.780 --> 01:53:42.940]   whatever you have.
[01:53:42.940 --> 01:53:49.340]   And so for 25 bucks, this is as good as some of the $15.75 keyboards that you can get that
[01:53:49.340 --> 01:53:51.700]   are made only a little bit better.
[01:53:51.700 --> 01:53:55.980]   The only, again, so it's worth having because, again, 25 bucks, the only thing I'm saying
[01:53:55.980 --> 01:53:59.820]   is that it's the one where you'd want to be a little bit careful of like sticking it
[01:53:59.820 --> 01:54:00.980]   in your bag.
[01:54:00.980 --> 01:54:05.060]   And then you're, especially when you're packing your hotel room in a hurry to get back home.
[01:54:05.060 --> 01:54:08.900]   So you stuff this in your carry-on bag, and then you take it out because, you know, in
[01:54:08.900 --> 01:54:10.540]   the middle of flex, you want to do some work.
[01:54:10.540 --> 01:54:14.660]   And because it's been like sitting like this twisted for a good four hours in your bag, suddenly
[01:54:14.660 --> 01:54:16.980]   it's all like wibbly wobbly on the table.
[01:54:16.980 --> 01:54:18.220]   So that's the only drawback of this one.
[01:54:18.220 --> 01:54:22.460]   But otherwise, it's a fantastic keyboard and certainly really, really good value that charges
[01:54:22.460 --> 01:54:24.380]   via Mac or USB.
[01:54:24.380 --> 01:54:27.860]   It's the sort of stuff, the sort of accessories that I really, really like, you know, that
[01:54:27.860 --> 01:54:32.940]   I'm attracted towards stuff that's affordable and stuff that people can just simply have.
[01:54:32.940 --> 01:54:36.580]   So whether you are, this is something where you don't have $100 worth of interest in a
[01:54:36.580 --> 01:54:39.820]   mobile keyboard, but you certainly wouldn't spend 25 bucks.
[01:54:39.820 --> 01:54:44.100]   Or like I'm doing with my mouse is where I just have like 10 years ago, it's at the
[01:54:44.100 --> 01:54:48.300]   MIT flea market and someone had torn down like a Microsoft Windows lab.
[01:54:48.300 --> 01:54:54.900]   I bought literally a just a box of USB Microsoft generation to USB mouse's scroll wheel
[01:54:54.900 --> 01:54:56.820]   mouse's for something like 10 bucks.
[01:54:56.820 --> 01:54:59.780]   And so over the past 10 years, I've just been sort of like every time I need a mouse, just
[01:54:59.780 --> 01:55:01.460]   grab one out of the box.
[01:55:01.460 --> 01:55:04.500]   Whenever it breaks three, four years later, throw it away, get another one from the box.
[01:55:04.500 --> 01:55:09.180]   So I'm just sort of steadily replacing ones that even though it still work with mouse's
[01:55:09.180 --> 01:55:10.180]   like this.
[01:55:10.180 --> 01:55:14.220]   Okay, now I got a, I got a, I got to mention something.
[01:55:14.220 --> 01:55:17.380]   Because if I don't, I'm going to get the email.
[01:55:17.380 --> 01:55:20.580]   Clearly you prefer mouses to mice.
[01:55:20.580 --> 01:55:22.420]   Yes.
[01:55:22.420 --> 01:55:25.500]   Would you like to explain?
[01:55:25.500 --> 01:55:26.660]   Because this is a mouse.
[01:55:26.660 --> 01:55:27.660]   Yeah.
[01:55:27.660 --> 01:55:31.820]   Many of these would be many of these you add a an S to the end of it.
[01:55:31.820 --> 01:55:37.820]   Mice, M-I-C-E is how you refer to groups of the living organism of mouse.
[01:55:37.820 --> 01:55:39.660]   Is that official?
[01:55:39.660 --> 01:55:40.660]   I've just said it.
[01:55:40.660 --> 01:55:43.580]   And I set the stands for rationality for the whole.
[01:55:43.580 --> 01:55:47.340]   What does the Chicago manual of style say about this?
[01:55:47.340 --> 01:55:52.700]   It's the, I, I, my influence and my correctness permeates the universe.
[01:55:52.700 --> 01:55:53.700]   Did you ask?
[01:55:53.700 --> 01:55:59.180]   You got your eber before he passed away because I would, no, actually, you know what?
[01:55:59.180 --> 01:56:02.420]   The Wired Style Guide says it's mouse's.
[01:56:02.420 --> 01:56:04.420]   There you go.
[01:56:04.420 --> 01:56:05.420]   Thank you.
[01:56:05.420 --> 01:56:06.420]   Chang is never wrong.
[01:56:06.420 --> 01:56:07.420]   Yep.
[01:56:07.420 --> 01:56:15.580]   This is the Microsoft manual of style for technical publications published in 1995 says
[01:56:15.580 --> 01:56:17.940]   avoid the plural mice.
[01:56:17.940 --> 01:56:21.100]   However, they say they kind of punt.
[01:56:21.100 --> 01:56:25.700]   If you need to refer to more than one of a mousing device, call them mouse, mouse devices.
[01:56:25.700 --> 01:56:30.300]   See, the, but the really nice thing about saying mouses instead of mice is that you can
[01:56:30.300 --> 01:56:34.220]   correct people when you think they've said it wrong and be profoundly arrogant about
[01:56:34.220 --> 01:56:36.300]   your choice as though it's official.
[01:56:36.300 --> 01:56:38.300]   I believe that's mouse's.
[01:56:38.300 --> 01:56:41.260]   It's like when blackberry said you couldn't pluralize their name.
[01:56:41.260 --> 01:56:42.260]   Excuse me.
[01:56:42.260 --> 01:56:43.260]   I'd say blackberry handsets.
[01:56:43.260 --> 01:56:44.260]   I'm sorry.
[01:56:44.260 --> 01:56:48.260]   I've never heard of the GIF format.
[01:56:48.260 --> 01:56:50.260]   What is the GIF graphic format?
[01:56:50.260 --> 01:56:51.260]   I've never heard of that.
[01:56:51.260 --> 01:56:52.260]   That was my loop.
[01:56:52.260 --> 01:56:54.700]   That's something came out of SIGGRAPH this year.
[01:56:54.700 --> 01:56:55.700]   Sorry.
[01:56:55.700 --> 01:56:56.700]   I just had to bring you.
[01:56:56.700 --> 01:56:58.260]   Oh, you meant to say GIF.
[01:56:58.260 --> 01:56:59.420]   Oh, okay.
[01:56:59.420 --> 01:57:02.780]   I usually deal with people who are very technologically savvy.
[01:57:02.780 --> 01:57:04.900]   They say things directly.
[01:57:04.900 --> 01:57:06.460]   You know, I'm trying to think what I would say.
[01:57:06.460 --> 01:57:09.260]   I think I would say mice, but I agree with you.
[01:57:09.260 --> 01:57:11.500]   Mouses is plural for the device.
[01:57:11.500 --> 01:57:13.140]   I would not correct you at some point.
[01:57:13.140 --> 01:57:16.620]   At some point, I made the deliberate choice that it's for me, it should be mouses because
[01:57:16.620 --> 01:57:17.700]   that sounds right for me.
[01:57:17.700 --> 01:57:19.260]   I would not correct somebody for saying that.
[01:57:19.260 --> 01:57:23.100]   Now, would your copy editor fix that if you wrote mouses in a piece?
[01:57:23.100 --> 01:57:30.260]   I break in my copy editors where I at some point, I say the big thing is I don't give
[01:57:30.260 --> 01:57:35.260]   a damn and it's correct to D-A-M and I say excuse me.
[01:57:35.260 --> 01:57:36.260]   That refers to it.
[01:57:36.260 --> 01:57:38.260]   Tinkers, spam, and he's not in.
[01:57:38.260 --> 01:57:39.260]   Yeah.
[01:57:39.260 --> 01:57:40.260]   Mickey, mouses.
[01:57:40.260 --> 01:57:43.660]   So yes, mouses is what gets copied from me.
[01:57:43.660 --> 01:57:45.260]   Which is a good time.
[01:57:45.260 --> 01:57:47.740]   Is any to steal 20 seconds worth of time?
[01:57:47.740 --> 01:57:52.180]   Do's a bon voyage to my son, Times editor, Craig Newman, who's been editor for years and
[01:57:52.180 --> 01:57:55.940]   years and years and years and he's moving on to other things and I miss him already and
[01:57:55.940 --> 01:57:58.980]   don't know what I'm going to do without him because he really is one of the great editors
[01:57:58.980 --> 01:57:59.980]   out there.
[01:57:59.980 --> 01:58:04.340]   As I said on Twitter, there are editors who look for your source of creativity and passion
[01:58:04.340 --> 01:58:08.580]   and ambition and poor sand on it and then there are editors who look at who find that
[01:58:08.580 --> 01:58:12.500]   and poor gasoline on it to cause it to, yes, encourage it to grow and Craig was definitely
[01:58:12.500 --> 01:58:14.060]   one of those guys.
[01:58:14.060 --> 01:58:17.460]   He will still be my friend but I'm just sad that he's not no longer going to be my editor.
[01:58:17.460 --> 01:58:22.660]   Wonderful New Yorker piece by Mary Norris who's for many years a copy editor at the
[01:58:22.660 --> 01:58:23.660]   New Yorker.
[01:58:23.660 --> 01:58:27.980]   She's actually written a book now called Between You and Me, Confessions of a Comic Queen.
[01:58:27.980 --> 01:58:29.940]   And it is great reading.
[01:58:29.940 --> 01:58:36.140]   As all, well certainly, Alex, you've written for text, for print.
[01:58:36.140 --> 01:58:37.140]   I have.
[01:58:37.140 --> 01:58:42.100]   Has anybody on this panel knows that copy editor is the single most important person in your
[01:58:42.100 --> 01:58:45.420]   life for Good or Ill and it's great.
[01:58:45.420 --> 01:58:50.660]   She talks about the battles she's had with various well-known authors and it's really
[01:58:50.660 --> 01:58:51.660]   great.
[01:58:51.660 --> 01:59:00.620]   So, there are some people who submit to the New Yorker who you just don't second-guess
[01:59:00.620 --> 01:59:01.620]   them.
[01:59:01.620 --> 01:59:09.020]   They're, who is the guy who wrote, who used to write those long pieces about John McPhee.
[01:59:09.020 --> 01:59:10.740]   She said you don't have to copy edit him.
[01:59:10.740 --> 01:59:13.700]   In fact, if he says something and you go, hmm, you change your tune.
[01:59:13.700 --> 01:59:18.580]   If he says mouses, you say mouses.
[01:59:18.580 --> 01:59:22.900]   So that's one pick between you and me, Confessions of a Comic Queen highly recommended it.
[01:59:22.900 --> 01:59:24.740]   There's an audible version of it, which I have not listened to.
[01:59:24.740 --> 01:59:27.260]   I'm going to have to get that.
[01:59:27.260 --> 01:59:29.500]   Have you guys have heard of Carrot?
[01:59:29.500 --> 01:59:30.500]   Yep.
[01:59:30.500 --> 01:59:33.940]   AI construct with a heart of weapons, great plutonium.
[01:59:33.940 --> 01:59:40.940]   Carrot does a whole bunch of iOS apps, including the Carrot calorie counter, your judgmental
[01:59:40.940 --> 01:59:42.380]   calorie counter.
[01:59:42.380 --> 01:59:46.100]   Carrot fit your judgmental fitness overlord.
[01:59:46.100 --> 01:59:51.700]   We talked on iOS today about Carrot weather, the weather robot with a personality.
[01:59:51.700 --> 01:59:56.700]   Well, good news today, they released Carrot weather for your Mac.
[01:59:56.700 --> 01:59:57.860]   Ridiculous price.
[01:59:57.860 --> 01:59:59.460]   But of course, that's what you'd expect.
[01:59:59.460 --> 02:00:00.700]   Ten dollars.
[02:00:00.700 --> 02:00:02.860]   And they say that's 25% off.
[02:00:02.860 --> 02:00:09.380]   I don't know if you need a snarky weather forecast app for your Macintosh, but it's a
[02:00:09.380 --> 02:00:10.580]   lot of fun.
[02:00:10.580 --> 02:00:14.420]   And they've added some nice features, including a time machine.
[02:00:14.420 --> 02:00:20.260]   So who knows how accurate it is, but you can go back or forward and see what the weather
[02:00:20.260 --> 02:00:25.660]   was like back then.
[02:00:25.660 --> 02:00:30.580]   So we went back to April 11th, 2015 and said, "Hey, by the way, can we make a quick pit stop
[02:00:30.580 --> 02:00:34.740]   in 1984 so I can kill John Connor?"
[02:00:34.740 --> 02:00:36.300]   Let's see how it is in Rwanda.
[02:00:36.300 --> 02:00:37.300]   Let's see how you're doing.
[02:00:37.300 --> 02:00:38.660]   I'm going to use evil genius.
[02:00:38.660 --> 02:00:40.060]   Yeah, who is it?
[02:00:40.060 --> 02:00:41.060]   Brian Mueller.
[02:00:41.060 --> 02:00:42.620]   See, he writes the copy, huh?
[02:00:42.620 --> 02:00:43.620]   Yeah.
[02:00:43.620 --> 02:00:48.500]   So you're checking the weather for tomorrow morning's walk of shame, aren't you?
[02:00:48.500 --> 02:00:53.100]   Yes, if I were in Rwanda, I would be.
[02:00:53.100 --> 02:00:56.700]   There's also something cool which I haven't unlocked yet.
[02:00:56.700 --> 02:00:58.620]   Secret locations.
[02:00:58.620 --> 02:01:00.660]   Keep using me to unlock secret locations.
[02:01:00.660 --> 02:01:03.660]   Each more wondrous than the last will find out.
[02:01:03.660 --> 02:01:05.780]   There are 31 of them and I have unlocked none.
[02:01:05.780 --> 02:01:09.460]   I think where their FRIOS went to 2.0 today as well.
[02:01:09.460 --> 02:01:12.060]   He's working.
[02:01:12.060 --> 02:01:15.420]   Can you ask him why it's $10?
[02:01:15.420 --> 02:01:17.060]   The Mac you want to make money, you know?
[02:01:17.060 --> 02:01:18.300]   He has to feed his carrot kids.
[02:01:18.300 --> 02:01:19.300]   They don't grow them so many.
[02:01:19.300 --> 02:01:21.460]   I hope he does.
[02:01:21.460 --> 02:01:26.060]   And so many, one of the reviewers who gives it only three stars says, "Hey, this is really
[02:01:26.060 --> 02:01:29.300]   well done, but there needs to be a snark meter."
[02:01:29.300 --> 02:01:30.300]   See?
[02:01:30.300 --> 02:01:34.220]   Look, if you buy carrot, expect the snark.
[02:01:34.220 --> 02:01:36.020]   Bring on the snark.
[02:01:36.020 --> 02:01:41.260]   Ladies and gentlemen, we are done with the Mac Break Weekly for this week.
[02:01:41.260 --> 02:01:44.060]   And as I mentioned, we'll do special coverage, whatever the day is.
[02:01:44.060 --> 02:01:45.940]   And we should usually don't they?
[02:01:45.940 --> 02:01:46.940]   When do they send out invites?
[02:01:46.940 --> 02:01:48.940]   Like a month before or a week before?
[02:01:48.940 --> 02:01:49.940]   A week before?
[02:01:49.940 --> 02:01:50.940]   A week before.
[02:01:50.940 --> 02:01:52.940]   Okay, so we'll know in three weeks.
[02:01:52.940 --> 02:01:53.940]   Don't let them be.
[02:01:53.940 --> 02:01:54.940]   You see they didn't even send out invites.
[02:01:54.940 --> 02:01:56.180]   So you never know what that will be.
[02:01:56.180 --> 02:01:57.980]   You don't know what that will be.
[02:01:57.980 --> 02:01:59.820]   But maybe we'll have everybody in studio.
[02:01:59.820 --> 02:02:01.700]   That'll be kind of fun.
[02:02:01.700 --> 02:02:07.420]   And Iannaka right now, he's back east in the beautiful New England amidst the thunderstorms.
[02:02:07.420 --> 02:02:10.980]   You could find his work on the Chicago Sun Time soon, a MacBook review.
[02:02:10.980 --> 02:02:12.820]   Any minute now?
[02:02:12.820 --> 02:02:13.820]   I'm sorry.
[02:02:13.820 --> 02:02:15.220]   I get hung up on these things.
[02:02:15.220 --> 02:02:19.500]   Were you debating mouses versus mice?
[02:02:19.500 --> 02:02:24.300]   No, because we hold that truth to be self-adventurous.
[02:02:24.300 --> 02:02:26.220]   Great to see you as always, Andy.
[02:02:26.220 --> 02:02:27.460]   Renee Ricci is at imore.com.
[02:02:27.460 --> 02:02:33.820]   A great place to go to get all the information you need to use your Apple stuff better.
[02:02:33.820 --> 02:02:35.820]   He's also on the Twitter @Renee Ricci.
[02:02:35.820 --> 02:02:37.580]   He's in beautiful Montreal.
[02:02:37.580 --> 02:02:42.220]   And from Kilgolly, which doesn't even have a weather forecast, it's so distant.
[02:02:42.220 --> 02:02:44.220]   I tried Kilgolly.
[02:02:44.220 --> 02:02:46.740]   I only could find Burundi.
[02:02:46.740 --> 02:02:49.060]   You know, it's Kigali.
[02:02:49.060 --> 02:02:50.460]   You probably would just say.
[02:02:50.460 --> 02:02:51.460]   Kigali.
[02:02:51.460 --> 02:02:52.460]   There's no...
[02:02:52.460 --> 02:02:53.460]   Yeah, Kigali.
[02:02:53.460 --> 02:02:54.460]   Maybe I misspelled it.
[02:02:54.460 --> 02:02:55.460]   K-I-G-A-L-I.
[02:02:55.460 --> 02:02:58.860]   How are you right?
[02:02:58.860 --> 02:03:02.820]   How close is Kigali to Burundi?
[02:03:02.820 --> 02:03:06.780]   It's about a three hour drive, like a three or four hour drive.
[02:03:06.780 --> 02:03:08.540]   So according to this, it's 69 degrees.
[02:03:08.540 --> 02:03:12.900]   Tomorrow, you're going to have a high of 85 with light rain starting in the afternoon,
[02:03:12.900 --> 02:03:14.300]   continuing to evening.
[02:03:14.300 --> 02:03:16.100]   Just so you know.
[02:03:16.100 --> 02:03:17.100]   Barbeque.
[02:03:17.100 --> 02:03:18.100]   Thank you.
[02:03:18.100 --> 02:03:19.100]   I was worried.
[02:03:19.100 --> 02:03:20.100]   How long are you going to be there?
[02:03:20.100 --> 02:03:21.100]   It's terrifying.
[02:03:21.100 --> 02:03:22.100]   I'm just here this week.
[02:03:22.100 --> 02:03:23.100]   So I'm here for meetings and more time.
[02:03:23.100 --> 02:03:25.660]   It takes you a week to fly there, practically.
[02:03:25.660 --> 02:03:27.420]   Oh, it only takes 30 hours.
[02:03:27.420 --> 02:03:28.420]   It's not a whole week.
[02:03:28.420 --> 02:03:30.140]   It's just a day and a half.
[02:03:30.140 --> 02:03:31.140]   So it's...
[02:03:31.140 --> 02:03:34.140]   You can get used to it.
[02:03:34.140 --> 02:03:38.700]   You can get used to it and dust them four times as much time.
[02:03:38.700 --> 02:03:42.460]   Well, you do get to sit in that nice...
[02:03:42.460 --> 02:03:47.020]   The layover is quite nice in Istanbul.
[02:03:47.020 --> 02:03:49.380]   And it's very good flight.
[02:03:49.380 --> 02:03:50.380]   There's nothing hard.
[02:03:50.380 --> 02:03:51.380]   I mean, I've gotten kind of used to it.
[02:03:51.380 --> 02:03:53.620]   I've settled into the flight that I like.
[02:03:53.620 --> 02:03:54.860]   And I love coming down.
[02:03:54.860 --> 02:03:57.180]   This is kind of my recharge is working on this.
[02:03:57.180 --> 02:03:59.540]   So from everything else I do.
[02:03:59.540 --> 02:04:02.020]   So anyway, so I'll be down here for a week.
[02:04:02.020 --> 02:04:07.860]   I'll be posting a lot more pictures on Facebook publicly so people can look at them.
[02:04:07.860 --> 02:04:10.020]   And I'm probably going to starting tomorrow.
[02:04:10.020 --> 02:04:12.540]   I was a little busy for the first few days, but I'll probably do some mirror caddying.
[02:04:12.540 --> 02:04:18.700]   I've done it in the past where I pop it up and put it on the cars and drive around Kigali
[02:04:18.700 --> 02:04:20.180]   and answer questions.
[02:04:20.180 --> 02:04:24.060]   So that'll probably be happening tomorrow afternoon or so for the rest of the time I'm
[02:04:24.060 --> 02:04:25.060]   here.
[02:04:25.060 --> 02:04:31.580]   One last note before we wrap up, a very happy birthday to our spiritual father and the creator
[02:04:31.580 --> 02:04:36.100]   of the personal computer we love known as the Apple computer.
[02:04:36.100 --> 02:04:42.460]   Steve Wozniak hits 60 years old today, 65 years old.
[02:04:42.460 --> 02:04:45.380]   They had a big party five years ago at the Computer History Museum for Steve.
[02:04:45.380 --> 02:04:47.620]   I remember 65.
[02:04:47.620 --> 02:04:49.060]   Who would have thunk it?
[02:04:49.060 --> 02:04:51.340]   That young guy.
[02:04:51.340 --> 02:04:52.540]   Thank you, Woz.
[02:04:52.540 --> 02:04:53.540]   We yeah.
[02:04:53.540 --> 02:04:54.540]   Thank you, Woz.
[02:04:54.540 --> 02:04:55.540]   Thank you.
[02:04:55.540 --> 02:04:56.540]   Great guy.
[02:04:56.540 --> 02:05:01.500]   And really the heart of the personal computer industry, I think.
[02:05:01.500 --> 02:05:05.820]   Can I also say that there is nobody I'm more looking forward to being one of those really
[02:05:05.820 --> 02:05:10.980]   cool old guys, like in 10 years time when he starts to look like he's in the 70s and
[02:05:10.980 --> 02:05:15.140]   80s, he will be he will be like the amazing Randy where he's like the cool when those
[02:05:15.140 --> 02:05:17.780]   really cool old guys.
[02:05:17.780 --> 02:05:20.340]   He's he's he's cool, but he's not really old yet.
[02:05:20.340 --> 02:05:22.740]   At some point he's just going to be.
[02:05:22.740 --> 02:05:26.180]   John too Kevin Flynn.
[02:05:26.180 --> 02:05:27.180]   Thanks everybody for joining us.
