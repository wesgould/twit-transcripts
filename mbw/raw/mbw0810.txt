[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.200]   What a surprise.
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.560]   And yes, Apple pays another 5 million euros
[00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.200]   to the Dutch Dating Apps Authority.

[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.680]   we cover the latest news from Apple.
[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.880]   And he's back from his two-week visit with Apple.
[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.160]   Renee Ritchie, YouTube.com/-- oh, I can already
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.080]   tell you're on the studio display.
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.680]   Your skin has never looked--
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.560]   Your skin has never looked better.
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.720]   It's smooth.
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.760]   It's useful.
[00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:03.800]   It is definitely--
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.560]   It's a wide camera and a wide camera world, Leo.
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.360]   Yeah, plus as he moves around, the camera
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.840]   is attempting to follow him.
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.360]   You can always tell it's an Apple--
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.400]   this little motion thing, because there's too much headroom.
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.040]   Yeah, they don't like the headroom.
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.160]   They don't like the headroom.
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.160]   Oh, my god.
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.480]   It's galling.
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.480]   That's Alex Lindsay.
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.160]   I hate my headroom.
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.800]   From 090.media and officehours.global.
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.240]   I watched your rocket launch this weekend.
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.920]   It's kind of fun.
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.240]   Really cool.
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.320]   It was like Walter Cronkite.
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.440]   It was great.
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.680]   You even had-- actually, Walter never had this.
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.920]   The trajectory, the speed, all of that stuff.
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:37.600]   That was very cool.
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.800]   Yeah, it was amazing.
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.680]   I mean, just remember, everybody just did that for fun.
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.200]   Like, that was like--
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.240]   there was no--
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.320]   there was just-- someone said, I'm doing a rocket.
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.520]   And then two people said, I want to come.
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.560]   And next thing, you know, there's 40 people working on it.
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.520]   And we had a co-host from Australia.
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.160]   And, you know, it was-- or the main host was from Australia.
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.120]   And she was breaking down the launch for us.
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.720]   She's an expert in space stuff.
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.880]   And she is an isoscerelian accent.
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:03.720]   That's the best.
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.240]   Even better.
[00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.120]   Smart with onoscerelian accent, the best.
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.920]   No, Wokenferries.
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.760]   And now, Andy Inaco from the library.
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.520]   Yes, this-- definitely our town taxes very much
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.120]   funded this-- my terra appearance.
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.560]   That's awesome.
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.480]   First, the public works department
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.480]   that decided to jackhammer the sidewalk outside my house,
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.240]   starting like 10 minutes before the show.
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.720]   And then the public library, which
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.120]   gave me a place to run to whenever I realized that.
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.680]   Yeah, they weren't just testing the equipment real quick.
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.800]   They're going to be here for a while.
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.720]   So we are all now catching up with Renee.
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:40.080]   Yes.
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.440]   Because I got my ultra-- my Mac studio,
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.520]   ultra on Friday.
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.000]   It's really leases.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.080]   And she's got it all set up.
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.080]   I had canceled after reading.
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.080]   We've already talked about this.
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.560]   We talked about it on Twitter.
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.640]   Jason Snow's not Twitter.
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.840]   But I canceled my Mac studio display
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.120]   after reading the reviews from Neil I Patel, from John Gruber,
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.000]   both of whom said the camera was terrible.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.400]   The center stage was imperfect.
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.040]   But what's interesting-- Jason Snow says,
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.000]   his camera looks great.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.560]   So it may be some sort of weird build thing.
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.320]   You're on the studio display.
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.640]   Camera does not look great.
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.560]   It doesn't look as good as whatever you're using before anyway.
[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.600]   The studio's display has literally an iPad 9 or an iPhone SE2.
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.760]   And with 64 gigs of storage--
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.560]   but no, that's economies of scale.
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.760]   They just have all these SOCs that they're--
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.520]   Apple's not immune to chip shortages.
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.480]   They just bought an awful lot of stuff in advance.
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:39.800]   And that's what they have in stock.
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.320]   And it makes all the sense in the world
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.280]   to economize that as much as they can.
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.080]   So you literally have an iPad 9 camera system,
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.520]   an ultra wide iPad 9 camera with center stage, the A13 SOC,
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:51.720]   the RAM, the store, all of it.
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:52.640]   It is literally--
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.300]   So it's really a Frankenstein display,
[00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.600]   Frankenstein display.
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.160]   I mean, who wanted an M1 in this, right?
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.320]   Like, you take out the M1 that everybody wanted.
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.480]   You put it in A13.
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.280]   Then you got a display.
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.280]   In fact, Mark Gurman, who was on for you last week,
[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.200]   that's basically what he had concluded.
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.720]   Oh, thank you, Mark.
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.120]   He had basically concluded that this was designed two years ago,
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.440]   same as the iPhone 11.
[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.760]   They had all these parts.
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:21.560]   There's no reason to take out the 64-gase of storage.
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.520]   You'd have to make a new SOC.
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.560]   So just throw it all in there.
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:26.320]   It's just the board.
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.160]   Yeah, you just throw it in and you're good.
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.440]   But the real question is, is it a good monitor for $1,500?
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.600]   So I mean, this is a hard thing to answer only
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.320]   because you have two very different types of customers.
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.280]   You have people who just want a monitor,
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.880]   who should stay away from this.
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.720]   And then you have people who for six years
[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.320]   have been begging Apple to just take the LG Ultrafine 5K
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.360]   panel or the 5K iMac panel.
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.120]   Just take that, put it in an Apple enclosure,
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.080]   and give it to them.
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.240]   Because the LG one has been problematic for years,
[00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.320]   Wi-Fi issues, display issues.
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.000]   It's cheap and plastic feeling.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.280]   So they're like, just give us that.
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.160]   Because what you can't get on the market,
[00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.560]   there are a lot of 4K displays, but 4K at 27 inches
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:12.320]   isn't precisely 2X, which is what anyone who cares about
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.040]   Apple Apple stuff, especially UI designers
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.640]   and people who care about pixel perfect things.
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:21.040]   They want that because it means it's exactly on the pixel grid.
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.200]   It's not being scaled up or down.
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.480]   So all these designers are just, yes, yes.
[00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:27.520]   Thankfully, finally, we've got it.
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.240]   They were the intended customer for this
[00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.520]   because there's no other reason for Apple to make a display.
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.240]   There are tons of other displays on the market.
[00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.480]   They didn't want to make it.
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.160]   LG just failed to make it.
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:37.560]   So they got back into it.
[00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.400]   And now a bunch of people who could care less
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.160]   about this monitor are angry about it.
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.040]   But the people who've been asking 4 for six years
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.600]   are beyond the moon happy.
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.440]   I got Lisa instead.
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.440]   I already bought it because I didn't know
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.600]   that Apple was going to come out with a studio display.
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:57.000]   So I got her-- actually, it's a UHD 4K LG Ultra Fine,
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.480]   but-- or not, I guess it's not Ultra Fine if it's not 5K.
[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.560]   But it's fine.
[00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.960]   And she's not running it at 4K anyway
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:10.040]   because the monitor next to it is 1440.
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.920]   So it scaled to 1440.
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.840]   Actually, it scales pretty nicely to 1440.
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.680]   Maybe that's-- is that because that's half 2880?
[00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.320]   I don't-- anyway, I know--
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:21.360]   At 24 inches, you want 4K-- sorry, 21.5 inches,
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.680]   you want 4K, 24, you want 4.5 inches.
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.360]   It's a 31-inch monitor.
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.680]   31 and 1/2-inch monitor.
[00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.600]   Then you want close to 6K.
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:29.280]   No, you don't.
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:30.640]   Again, if you care about those things.
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:32.800]   She's not doing-- she's barely doing spreadsheets.
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.240]   You care about the grid.
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.040]   Yeah, OK.
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.800]   Her pivot tables need to be on grid.
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.480]   Yeah, no, they are on grid.
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:41.320]   But what I'm saying is I had to lower the resolution anyway
[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:44.280]   because it had to match the 49-inch monitor
[00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:45.800]   that's on the other side of it.
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.600]   You don't want to be moving back and forth
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:48.360]   and have the--
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:49.880]   No, yeah.
[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:51.440]   All point sizes had to match.
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:53.160]   Anyway, it was working great.
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:55.960]   I have to say, the studio is beautiful.
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.640]   We all watched Max Tech tear it apart.
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:01.680]   Vadim did a-- he was a brave man.
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:05.240]   Because he was barely tearing apart his video editors,
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:06.640]   Max Studio.
[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:09.000]   And I'm watching him take these screws out.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.360]   And I can feel his pain knowing he's
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.440]   going to have to put those back.
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:15.800]   But thank goodness he did it.
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:16.800]   Because we saw the size--
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:17.640]   That would have been me.
[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:21.600]   Yeah, but we saw the size of the Ultra chip.
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:22.600]   It was really a great--
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:25.960]   I thought he did a good job with a tear down.
[00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:29.160]   He took the thermal paste off and all of that.
[00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.880]   It was a good job.
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:35.040]   And now we know how-- I think-- I know, you tell me.
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:36.480]   Beautifully made that studio is.
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:37.480]   It looked like it was--
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:39.640]   Oh, yeah, just marvelous.
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:41.920]   Thoreau made a good-- actually a really funny joke where he
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:43.960]   said, like, how much bigger the M1 Ultra is
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.800]   than an average AMD CPU.
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.680]   But it's just important to remember that this isn't just
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:48.240]   a CPU.
[00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:50.480]   This is an entire package.
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.480]   So you've got CPU-- yeah.
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:55.440]   So yeah, like an Intel Horizon or AMD CPU
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.600]   is going to be way smaller.
[00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.440]   Because the GPU and everything is separate.
[00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.400]   So that's one of the reasons it's so big.
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.800]   Yeah.
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:05.280]   Vadim did make one mistake where he kind of said,
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:07.480]   oh, it's upgradable.
[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:10.000]   Jason was able to correct that by saying there.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.120]   By the way, there is-- so that's the Ultra chip
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:15.360]   is where this thermal paste is.
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.560]   But in fact, if I go a little farther,
[00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:19.040]   he takes the thermal paste off.
[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:21.880]   And you can even see the Apple logo on it, which is kind of cool.
[00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:22.520]   You can still look at it.
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.720]   And compare it to a Ryzen.
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:28.520]   But this is RAM above it and RAM below it.
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:31.960]   And the ML cores and all the other stuff.
[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:33.440]   Yeah, GPU cores.
[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:34.040]   Yeah.
[00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:36.480]   So this is not that huge.
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:39.200]   It's just two chips side by side, basically.
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:41.800]   And all those chips around it that are surrounding it,
[00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:43.040]   all those chips around it are the things
[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.400]   they haven't gotten to yet.
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:45.880]   Yeah, because eventually, when you're just
[00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:48.520]   like a one chip solution, I think that's what I think.
[00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:49.280]   Can I do that?
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:52.120]   I think they're straining TSMC's packaging technology already.
[00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:52.600]   Yeah.
[00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.200]   We'll see how big this gets.
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:59.960]   Well, it's going to be twice as big, probably, with the pro.
[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:01.400]   Yeah, but it'll be four times bigger.
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:02.240]   Four times bigger.
[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:02.800]   I think at that point.
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:03.880]   Just put it side by side.
[00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:05.280]   But you want to use that interconnect.
[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:06.000]   On to dies.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:06.680]   Don't you want to use it?
[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:07.840]   You know it has only for one set, though.
[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.720]   You can only have one interconnect on this generation,
[00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:11.080]   one interconnect separate per--
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:12.080]   Oh, you know that?
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:14.520]   Because some people have been saying, oh, they'll do a plus.
[00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:15.480]   No.
[00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:16.720]   Yeah, you can go three dimensionally,
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:18.480]   but I don't think you're going to get the same interconnect speed.
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:19.840]   You might get a good interconnect speed.
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:22.960]   There's not interconnect all the way around the chip.
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:24.160]   It's 2.5D's.
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:25.320]   Alas, it's not 3D yet.
[00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:25.920]   It's getting there.
[00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:26.440]   OK.
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:27.440]   OK.
[00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:28.440]   That's what's up.
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:32.000]   Anyway, beautifully made.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.360]   Alex sent me--
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:35.560]   You said they clarified that the memory is not--
[00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:36.840]   it gets not upgradable.
[00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:39.680]   It's usable by-- there's an empty slot
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:41.240]   because a lot of people got the lowest memory--
[00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.720]   If you got eight terabytes, they would fill those.
[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:45.000]   They would have four terabytes.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.280]   They would fill those.
[00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:47.280]   Apple can fill them.
[00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:49.240]   They're a non-standard chip for one thing,
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:50.280]   non-standard pinning.
[00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:50.720]   And non-standard pinning.
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:51.440]   Well, they're naked.
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:52.360]   There's just nothing on them.
[00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:52.920]   They're naked and--
[00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:54.200]   They're literally the raw chips.
[00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:56.960]   And I think Jason pointed this out.
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:01.240]   You have to certify it in the software, say it's there.
[00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:02.840]   So you can't just stick something in there.
[00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:03.880]   You can't even move more.
[00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:04.880]   You're on the chip.
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:05.880]   The controllers aren't on--
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:08.160]   It's like an SD slot on an old computer.
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:09.640]   Everything is on the SOC.
[00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:10.160]   Right.
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.320]   And you couldn't just-- even if you could get something that
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:17.000]   was like if other world computing made something identical
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.600]   in form factor, it still wouldn't work
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:19.680]   because it has to be--
[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:20.800]   But Apple, we're not saying that--
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:22.240]   This is the question figured out, Leo,
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:23.320]   because they can figure out every--
[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:25.640]   This is the question, could Apple, if I brought my studio in
[00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:28.320]   and I said I would like two more terabytes, could Apple do it?
[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:30.640]   Presumably they could if they started to offer that.
[00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:31.000]   Maybe.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:31.880]   They haven't announced it yet.
[00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:33.320]   And they did announce that they could switch the Visa
[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:34.360]   mount in the back of your--
[00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:35.320]   I did see that.
[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:36.320]   So they do.
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:37.800]   You bring in-- if you get-- if you decide,
[00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.640]   I want the pivot or I don't want the pivot.
[00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:40.480]   I want Visa.
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.560]   You could bring it in and they can do that in the--
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:44.200]   And they can take out the power cord.
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:45.160]   We've had the silliest--
[00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:46.960]   Oh, don't pull the power cord.
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:49.240]   Yeah, when we did the unboxing, I looked at it and I said,
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:50.680]   that looks just like the one on the iMac.
[00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:53.440]   You probably just pull it out, don't.
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:54.840]   Well, you can't.
[00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:56.880]   It's proprietary because it's so thin.
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:58.200]   Let a professional do it.
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:11:59.600]   I'm just saying.
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:04.680]   So Alex sent me the photogrammetry--
[00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:06.440]   We call it the Widowmaker.
[00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:07.400]   The Widowmaker.
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:08.720]   The photogrammetry project.
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:11.560]   I think I shot it like five years ago when I was in India.
[00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:13.840]   You sent it to iJustine when she got the Mac Pro.
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:17.720]   That's why all her cores were pegged when she did her video.
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:20.320]   Now, you said when you run this on your laptop,
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:21.400]   which laptop?
[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:24.000]   No, on my iMac, it runs for three days,
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.160]   and then the iMac crashes.
[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:28.080]   Well, you never-- if decimation's turned on.
[00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:28.920]   It's fine without it.
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:30.640]   But if you turn decimation on, it
[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:34.240]   is when that's really the thing that takes a while.
[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:36.080]   So I did not--
[00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:38.000]   your video did not say turn on--
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.080]   well, maybe it did, but it was optional.
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:42.280]   So I decided not to turn on decimation.
[00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:44.640]   I'm going to go home and redo these benchmarks.
[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:46.880]   But a couple of things came up, which I thought
[00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:48.160]   was kind of surprising.
[00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.120]   And now more and more people are saying this.
[00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:56.200]   I benchmarked it on the Mac Studio Ultra, only 64 gigs of RAM.
[00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:59.000]   And by the way, the program we use Metashape
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.440]   is very RAM intensive.
[00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:02.520]   So it would have worked probably faster.
[00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:02.880]   It would.
[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:03.960]   It would have been 28 gigs.
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:05.760]   It will use everything.
[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:08.480]   It just generally will go out and grab onto everything
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:10.240]   it can possibly get a hold of and start using it.
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:11.640]   So it wasn't really a fair comparison,
[00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:14.960]   because I also did it on my Alienware Aurora, which
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:20.800]   is running an AMD Ryzen 7 5800X and a GeForce RTX 3080.
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:24.480]   So pretty high-end hardware with 128 gigs of RAM.
[00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.400]   So it ends that RAM.
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:28.080]   And they've had more time to optimize for it
[00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:28.760]   than they have.
[00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:31.760]   I think some of this is Metashape, as AGI stuff, which
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:34.480]   is, by the way, you said that there's
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.560]   a 30-day trial you can download this and run it, which is good,
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:37.440]   because I wasn't going to buy it.
[00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:38.760]   I'm sure it's expensive.
[00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:40.200]   But I couldn't get to it at first.
[00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:41.840]   In fact, I was starting writing you an email saying,
[00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:43.200]   well, the site in Russia, it's down.
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:45.440]   And then I realized, oh, I block Russian sites.
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:46.200]   So I had to go in.
[00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:48.880]   And what was funny was that I have to find some other stuff,
[00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:50.960]   too, because I forgot that it was Russian.
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:51.960]   I just didn't--
[00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:53.560]   I haven't had to deal with them--
[00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:54.160]   Right.
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:55.160]   --for years.
[00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:56.480]   There's other programs into this.
[00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:58.600]   Until you said it before the show,
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:00.960]   I was like, all right, they're rushing from St. Petersburg.
[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:03.880]   But by the way, it doesn't mean they're bad people.
[00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:05.760]   We just don't want to send them any money.
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:07.360]   We probably can't send them anyway.
[00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:09.880]   Anyway, I ran it on the Mac Studio without decimation,
[00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:10.480]   which is what?
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:12.120]   What is decimation?
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:14.560]   A decimation says, I've got a whole bunch of polygons.
[00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:15.360]   I want to reduce it.
[00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:19.160]   So that specific thing, one left undesimated,
[00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:21.560]   it will be about 350 million polygons.
[00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:22.080]   Oh, wow.
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:23.760]   And you can't open that on your phone.
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:25.720]   So if you want to get around 2 million--
[00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:26.280]   OK.
[00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:28.520]   --and then what it does is it looks at the--
[00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:32.160]   each surface is broken into what we call a polygon.
[00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:34.280]   And it looks at the breaking go between every surface.
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:36.600]   So it goes, well, these are really close together.
[00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:38.280]   So I'm just going to make them one.
[00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:39.760]   And then if it's curving, they'll say,
[00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:41.120]   I'll leave those polygons there.
[00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:44.320]   So it flattens things out, puts better detail
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:45.120]   where it needs to be.
[00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:48.000]   And so it's a kind of an intelligent process
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:48.520]   to kind of--
[00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:49.200]   And that's--
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:49.840]   --number polygons.
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:52.480]   CPU bound.
[00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:53.480]   Yeah.
[00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:58.880]   So the four steps I did on both the PC and the Mac Studio Ultra
[00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:00.040]   was align the photos.
[00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:02.320]   There were 228 raw--
[00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:06.880]   Canon CR2 raw photos of this Indian--
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:07.840]   is it a temple?
[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:08.560]   This historic site.
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:09.640]   It's actually just a square.
[00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:11.600]   No, it's a square--
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:12.480]   it's a spice square.
[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:13.800]   Like they have--
[00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:16.400]   It's like the spice central of a deli.
[00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:18.480]   It's got a square inside of a building.
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:19.000]   It's kind of cool.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.720]   You took a lot of pictures.
[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:23.720]   So the first thing it does is align the photos.
[00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:25.760]   And that took three and a half hours in the Mac Studio.
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:27.800]   You could see-- by the way, this is the last stage--
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:29.960]   first aligns the photos, then it builds a dense cloud,
[00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:32.160]   then it builds a mesh, then it builds a texture.
[00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:33.760]   It's almost done here.
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:36.320]   And you could see-- so this is the CPU cores.
[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:38.160]   I'm running the activity monitor.
[00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:42.600]   Or you could see it's redlining on the efficiency cores.
[00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:44.600]   It's really-- this is something you probably--
[00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:46.360]   I told Lisa, you're never going to see this again
[00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:47.920]   on your Mac Studio.
[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:50.520]   But all 20 cores are 100%.
[00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:55.360]   But notice the GPU not really being--
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:58.320]   I don't think they just don't know how to do it yet.
[00:15:58.320 --> 00:15:59.280]   They didn't do it yet.
[00:15:59.280 --> 00:15:59.760]   Yeah.
[00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:01.640]   They only-- they were a little late getting to the M1,
[00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:01.920]   even.
[00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:05.400]   This is M1 native, but they didn't get to that
[00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:06.600]   till late last year.
[00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:10.560]   So I think that maybe they haven't optimized it yet.
[00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:14.400]   But I'll give you the run times anyway.
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:15.920]   PC, it took three and a half hours
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:18.200]   to align the photos.
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:21.560]   On the Mac, it took three and a half hours.
[00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:25.320]   So that was-- I noticed those were CPU intensive.
[00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:30.840]   This was CPU intensive on the Mac and GPU intensive on the PC.
[00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:32.960]   So I think that confirms what you're saying.
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:36.120]   The 3080 really chewed through that.
[00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:37.840]   But it wasn't much faster.
[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:40.280]   Building the dense cloud is what took a long time on the Mac.
[00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:44.320]   That was 13 and a half hours compared to under two hours
[00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:47.680]   on the PC, under two hours.
[00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:49.800]   So that's a big difference.
[00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:52.320]   And that's something that's more easily paralyzed.
[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:55.440]   So it's that thing so that if it was optimized
[00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:58.200]   for that graphics card, we would expect it to be a lot faster.
[00:16:58.200 --> 00:16:59.200]   Yeah.
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:02.480]   And also, again, more RAM, twice as much RAM.
[00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:04.920]   The rest of the times are pretty comparable.
[00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:06.840]   The Mac took half an hour to build the mesh.
[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:10.200]   It was only 20 minutes on the PC to build the texture on the Mac
[00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:13.160]   three hours, 14 minutes to build the texture on the PC
[00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:14.600]   and hour and 14 minutes.
[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:18.560]   So the real difference was that second step, which took a long
[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:20.800]   time on the Mac studio.
[00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:21.800]   What's the moral there?
[00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:24.440]   Well, if you're using meta-shaped to do photogrammetry,
[00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:27.880]   you'd probably do it better on a PC with enough hardware.
[00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:31.320]   And again, we want to say if you're using that app on that software
[00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:31.480]   hardware--
[00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:32.400]   Specifically.
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:32.880]   Yes.
[00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:35.400]   Because one of the things that I'm going to be testing when
[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:39.440]   my studio arrives is the photo--
[00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:43.960]   the object capture that Apple does, which is optimized for it.
[00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:46.680]   And so it's going-- which I think could be really fast.
[00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:49.680]   So you're going to send me a cinema 3D project.
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:50.200]   Yeah.
[00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:52.840]   So for the next test, we're going to build something in cinema
[00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:55.000]   4D that pushes it pretty hard.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.920]   It won't maybe not take 30 hours to render,
[00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:59.600]   but it might take six on my computer, like six or seven hours
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:00.240]   to render something.
[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:02.560]   It's got a bunch of global illumination, a bunch of geometry,
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:03.640]   a bunch of things.
[00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:05.080]   And then you can open that.
[00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:06.800]   But I'll use just primitive shapes
[00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:08.640]   so that you don't need any models.
[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:13.200]   It'll be a really light little project that will be complicated.
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:16.280]   So then you can just open it up and go.
[00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:18.840]   We've seen some other stories like this from Hardware
[00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:19.600]   Times, "Approles."
[00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:23.000]   "Emwen" Ultra gets murdered by AMD's thread rippers,
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.280]   slower than the RTX 3050 in content creation.
[00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:28.280]   And I think what you're really seeing
[00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:32.840]   is not as much a hardware comparison as software comparisons
[00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:36.080]   here, whether they're optimized properly and things like that.
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:37.880]   And also what you're doing with them.
[00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:40.280]   So there are certain things that are--
[00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:42.800]   so in the creation process, there
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:45.680]   are certain things that are going to do better on a raw GPU
[00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:46.920]   than a CPU, et cetera.
[00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:49.400]   But there's also things that we haven't really talked about.
[00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:51.480]   So grabbing a big model and rotating it,
[00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:55.680]   like a giant model of 300 million polygons with 8K textures
[00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:59.800]   needs a ton of RAM, and possibly more than what
[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:01.640]   a video card can actually handle.
[00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:04.640]   So that's where an M1 might end up being better.
[00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:05.240]   I'll tell you what.
[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:06.400]   It's rotating those things around.
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:09.480]   I never decimated that model.
[00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:11.960]   But when it finished, I was able to rotate it in real time
[00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:15.080]   and very easily move around with it, no problem.
[00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:17.000]   So that confirms what you're saying.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.160]   So that model that Apple uses--
[00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:19.320]   I think Alex is familiar with it.
[00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:20.880]   The model that the Pro Workflows team is.
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:23.560]   It's a spaceship that's got the sun behind it.
[00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:25.120]   And it's polygon count is observed.
[00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:28.480]   And it's too big to fit in the RAM of any existing video card.
[00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:30.000]   But because of the unified memory,
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.640]   they can open it, move it, move the sun, all in real time.
[00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:33.280]   It retexures.
[00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:34.760]   It does all of those things.
[00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:36.240]   By the way, look how much better--
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:36.920]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:39.840]   Look how much better in Hays picture looks now.
[00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:41.360]   Can I add one thing, Leo, too?
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:42.720]   One of the biggest issues we're seeing--
[00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:44.040]   we've seen this for a long time now,
[00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:45.920]   but it's sort of coming to a head with this--
[00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:48.040]   is that it is not easy to benchmark.
[00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:48.320]   Right.
[00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:50.520]   It looks easy now because so many companies
[00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:53.880]   make these prepackage, download, run and done in one
[00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:54.960]   benchmarking apps.
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:55.960]   Like, they're on the app store.
[00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:57.880]   You literally download them, you press a button.
[00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:59.200]   But you're not an ant tech.
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:00.280]   And you don't have to be.
[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:02.720]   But an ant tech spent years learning what they're doing.
[00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:05.880]   And it takes them several days and a lot of work
[00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:08.280]   to get the quality of benchmarkings they do.
[00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:10.400]   And a lot of people-- and I made all these mistakes.
[00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:12.400]   I would run them, and I would say, why aren't they different?
[00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:15.640]   I realized, oh, I'm running 1440 on display.
[00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:17.400]   And that's not even pushing the max.
[00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:18.920]   So of course, I'm not seeing a difference.
[00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:21.160]   I have to go 4K off screen.
[00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:22.800]   Oh, I need a commercial license for that.
[00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:24.160]   That's not the free version.
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:26.640]   So I got to go and get the commercial license for that.
[00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:28.440]   Or you've got to run in unlimited mode
[00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:30.080]   because otherwise you're not taxing.
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:33.640]   So it is really easy and fast to do it wrong.
[00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:35.640]   And a lot of the early tests we saw
[00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:37.680]   was like-- it was just people running these apps,
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:39.800]   but not having any context for what they were running.
[00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:43.000]   The Geekbench or the Cinemark or all of those.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.800]   And by the way, I know this because I
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:47.960]   worked with Patrick Norton, who did all the benchmarking
[00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:50.280]   for a PC--
[00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:52.040]   ZDZ, PC Labs.
[00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:53.240]   It wasn't so easy.
[00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:54.080]   It's not easy.
[00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:55.320]   And Patrick was a master of it.
[00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:56.920]   You really have to know what you're doing.
[00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:59.000]   Nontech has not yet come out with their benchmarks,
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.120]   which is kind of telling.
[00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:02.160]   Well, they're not fast.
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:03.360]   So they're never fast.
[00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:04.520]   Like, one of the jokes was like, I
[00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:06.600]   think it's Ryan a year to do a Mac once.
[00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:08.320]   And I don't think it's going to take that long.
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:11.160]   But the level of work-- and also, future
[00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:12.600]   has destroyed that company.
[00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:13.840]   They've lost almost everybody.
[00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:16.200]   Almost everybody left to go work at the companies.
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:18.360]   So it's really only Ryan and a couple people left.
[00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:20.040]   Andre just left, who did the last--
[00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:21.040]   Yes, I saw that.
[00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:21.560]   Yeah.
[00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:23.040]   Yeah.
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:24.400]   So it's going to be hard.
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:26.680]   Yeah.
[00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:29.520]   Which means it's very hard for a consumer to decide.
[00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:32.720]   Because on the one hand, you have Apple's Stellar marketing,
[00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:36.080]   which makes you feel like this is the fastest thing ever
[00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:37.960]   made in the whole wide world.
[00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:42.240]   And so the reason I bring up the photogrammetry example
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:45.840]   is not to diss the Mac Studio, but just to say it's complicated.
[00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:47.400]   And it really does depend on what you're doing,
[00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:49.680]   the software you're using, how well tuned it is.
[00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:52.080]   And ultra as cool as the ultra is,
[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:56.760]   and how much faster it is than the old Mac Pro,
[00:21:56.760 --> 00:22:02.000]   it's still not necessarily the fastest beast in the woods.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.760]   And it depends at what, too.
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:05.600]   A lot of the stuff-- we were talking about this before,
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:07.400]   this show-- if you have an Nvidia card,
[00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:09.920]   if you have a 3090, you can beat it with an M1 Ultra
[00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:11.240]   in some tests.
[00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:13.760]   And those tests are well optimized for both.
[00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:15.600]   So there are a few tests that will win it there.
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:17.200]   If you test, it will lose that.
[00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:19.960]   If you need CUDA cores, you need ray tracing, you need gaming,
[00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:22.320]   it does not matter how fast the M1 Ultra is.
[00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:24.320]   Because it will not help you in the least.
[00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:24.840]   Yes.
[00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:25.760]   And I will say this.
[00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:31.120]   The Alienware Aurora fans were on max and loud the whole time.
[00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:34.560]   They didn't overheat, but they were audible.
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:36.480]   And at no point did this affect the studio
[00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:38.360]   when you turn it on, the fans come on.
[00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:39.480]   And they just run.
[00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:40.680]   They never ramped up.
[00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:41.480]   They never ramp down.
[00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:43.720]   They're completely silent.
[00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:46.560]   When I was showing that picture of all the cores peaked,
[00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:49.800]   put my hand behind it, the ears may be slightly warm.
[00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:51.480]   Nothing's hot to the touch.
[00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:53.840]   So the cooling system on that is excellent,
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:57.400]   as Vadim's video demonstrates, they've really
[00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:58.840]   done a good job with cooling it.
[00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:00.800]   And if I can give you just a couple numbers,
[00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:03.160]   like if you have an optimized GPU load,
[00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:06.080]   you'll get 1.9 times the performance of the max,
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:08.880]   because it really does treat it as one metal object.
[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:11.600]   The neural engines are not treated as one object,
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:14.320]   just because neural engines are like their own little self-contained
[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:14.960]   kingdoms.
[00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:16.320]   But it will dispatch between them.
[00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:18.240]   So you'll get like 1.5%.
[00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:22.360]   And that's like 1.7% in mixed GPU neural engine workloads.
[00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:24.960]   And for ProRes, it's almost twice as fast again.
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:28.040]   So if your boundary-- if literally time is more important
[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:31.520]   than money to you, you can get almost twice as fast ProRes
[00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:34.160]   renderings off of this, which you can't get on a lot of other videos.
[00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:37.520]   But those, again, those are cherry-picked numbers from Apple.
[00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:37.880]   And--
[00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:39.720]   It depends on your work looks like cherry-picked numbers.
[00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:41.080]   It's not cherry-picked in the sense
[00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:44.360]   that it's going to reflect best on the Ultra.
[00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:46.080]   You have to know what you want to do,
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:49.280]   and you have to do some figuring to figure out
[00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:50.440]   if the Ultra is going to benefit your--
[00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:51.480]   Yeah, you need to know your workflow.
[00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:52.840]   You need to know what you're doing.
[00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:54.440]   And I think that you need to know it well.
[00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:56.600]   And again, the people who really are
[00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:58.160]   going to get the most out of a PC
[00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:01.800]   are going to be doing some pretty esoteric things with it.
[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:04.200]   If you're doing-- and that's great.
[00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:07.680]   And I still have PCs that do PC things for me
[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:10.920]   because I need four NVIDIA cards,
[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:13.320]   or I need a bunch of other things that need to be addressed.
[00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:15.440]   So I'm not saying this is-- I definitely
[00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:17.360]   don't think it's the fastest-- as the thing
[00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:18.800]   that I want to put on my desk that
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:22.640]   is going to be really fast for the stuff I do day to day,
[00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:24.560]   it's a pretty exciting platform.
[00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:28.560]   And if you're a video editor, it's very much optimized
[00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:29.520]   for what you're doing.
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:30.880]   Especially if you're using Final Cut.
[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:32.680]   I got one for Henry.
[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:33.640]   I got an old-- Or Resolve.
[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:35.320]   Because, you know, or Resolve.
[00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:36.440]   How about Premiere?
[00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:37.480]   Well, is it--
[00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:39.800]   They're definitely-- I think Adobe's definitely optimizing it
[00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:41.040]   and I think it's going to get better.
[00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:42.440]   I don't know if it's native yet.
[00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:44.320]   There's a hard part with--
[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:46.680]   After all of the Adobe products.
[00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:48.200]   Yeah, all the all the Adobe products
[00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:49.840]   just have a lot of technical debt.
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:51.200]   And so they-- you know, so it just
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:54.440]   takes them a little longer to take full advantage
[00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:54.960]   of the hardware.
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:55.920]   Yeah.
[00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:59.840]   So-- and the other point, really important point,
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:03.760]   maybe more important to real people is you probably
[00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:04.680]   don't need the Ultra.
[00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:06.280]   Very few people will need the Ultra.
[00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:07.600]   Probably need a Mac Mini.
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:08.400]   You're almost everything.
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:08.400]   Yeah.
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:09.400]   Well, you know what I bought.
[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:10.240]   You can stop that Mac Mini.
[00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:13.560]   I bought from my office after all is a Mac Mini.
[00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:13.960]   Why not?
[00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:14.480]   And I bought--
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:15.320]   It's great.
[00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:15.880]   Yeah.
[00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:17.160]   I bought the Macs.
[00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:19.840]   I didn't get the Ultra because I'm planning to get the Mac Pro.
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:20.960]   So I'm starting to save for that.
[00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:22.840]   And I was like, I'm not going to buy one that's really,
[00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:24.400]   really good and then another one that's even better.
[00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:25.480]   I'm going to buy one that--
[00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:27.440]   I can set-- this one's going to be my desk unit
[00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:31.440]   that I'm doing my desk work, fast desk work with.
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:36.520]   Let me ask a challenging question, though, of all of you.
[00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:41.560]   As high as I am on Apple Silicon,
[00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:48.720]   the M2, based on the A15, right, is not going to necessarily be--
[00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:53.240]   we're not going to see doubling every year, right?
[00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:54.640]   No, I mean, the only way else is to double it
[00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:56.040]   is if the inner--
[00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:56.540]   Yeah.
[00:25:56.540 --> 00:25:59.060]   Well, I mean, the big story with M2 is increased efficiency.
[00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:01.340]   So you'll be able to put it in smaller enclosures,
[00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:02.740]   like the MacBook Air.
[00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:04.700]   It's slightly faster on single core.
[00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:06.540]   It can support extra cores.
[00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:08.060]   So you'll get some multi-core scaling
[00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:10.940]   because you'll have one or two or four extra cores
[00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:11.900]   in the setup.
[00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:14.460]   But also, it might have a ultra-fusion
[00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:18.900]   in more than just a to-die configuration, which would allow it
[00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:21.260]   to, again, double up the scale.
[00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:22.660]   And I think the more exciting thing
[00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:24.260]   is that when you get to the Mac Pro,
[00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:26.180]   it's not going to be just about extra speed.
[00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:29.740]   That's going to be the one that's extensible, that has a PCIe
[00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:30.660]   card slots.
[00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:32.740]   So if that's something you need, this does not help you.
[00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:35.100]   This is trashcan, the second generation.
[00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:37.660]   If you want the cheese grater, next generation,
[00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:39.820]   then that's what the Mac Pro is going to be for you.
[00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:41.500]   Yeah, and I know people love Max,
[00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:43.420]   and I don't want to rain on your parade by any means.
[00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:44.620]   And I'm very happy--
[00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:45.820]   Lisa's got a max.
[00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:47.540]   I'm going to have an ultra on Friday.
[00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:49.860]   That'll be for my home system.
[00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:50.700]   No, she has an ultra.
[00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:51.820]   I'm going to have a max on Friday.
[00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:53.100]   I know I don't need an ultra.
[00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:53.660]   I know she does.
[00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:55.100]   I put it on the home theater, aren't you, Leo?
[00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:55.780]   Yeah, I'm not going to.
[00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:58.580]   Yeah, it's actually could be a great home theater machine,
[00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:01.380]   by the way, because it's very quiet.
[00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:03.460]   Great for super Nintendo emulation.
[00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:05.020]   That's really what you want.
[00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:05.820]   But--
[00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:07.100]   Don't take down your videos.
[00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:08.900]   It's very easy, and I fell for it.
[00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:10.940]   It's very easy to think that this
[00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:17.100]   is revolutionary technology compared to everything else
[00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:20.820]   out in the universe, including Intel and AMD and others.
[00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:23.380]   And it is revolutionary for Apple,
[00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:24.420]   and it's very exciting.
[00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:25.220]   For exciting you it is, too.
[00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:30.500]   But I don't think the expectation is Apple to the moon.
[00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:32.300]   And I don't know.
[00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:34.820]   These are really iPhone chips.
[00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:36.540]   Apple's just capitalizing on the development
[00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:37.820]   of the revolutionary for--
[00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:38.540]   iPhone.
[00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:40.020]   No one's been able to do the GPU stuff.
[00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:41.340]   Everyone's tried and haven't been able to--
[00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:42.700]   It's essentially though.
[00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:45.300]   Motherboard, it's essentially built in GPU.
[00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:47.380]   It's not discrete GPU.
[00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:48.140]   Right, but the thing is--
[00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:49.020]   Does it matter if Apple--
[00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:50.740]   Does implementation matter?
[00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:53.980]   If Apple starts to build games that
[00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:57.460]   take full advantage of the RAM available to the GPU,
[00:27:57.460 --> 00:27:58.180]   it will be--
[00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:00.020]   There's a lot of ifs there.
[00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:00.540]   If they do.
[00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:01.220]   No, you're absolutely.
[00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:01.780]   If they do.
[00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:03.900]   But I'm saying that right now, no one's ever
[00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:07.020]   had that much RAM available to the GPU.
[00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:08.540]   So there's when we look at it, there
[00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:09.860]   are so many things that I did.
[00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:11.780]   When I first started doing games,
[00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:13.980]   my whole level that you were in was
[00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:16.100]   limited to 3,000 polygons.
[00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:19.860]   The iPhone right now is limited to 2 million polygons.
[00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:23.740]   But if I could bring in, let's say, 400 million polygons
[00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:26.180]   with 8K texture maps and motion blur
[00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:27.340]   and a bunch of other things, those
[00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:28.700]   are all things that take-- a lot of it
[00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:32.380]   takes a lot of RAM that I couldn't do right now.
[00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:34.540]   And so that's the thing that can be done with that one.
[00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:36.820]   Developers, though, are very reluctant to write
[00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:39.660]   to that hardware because it's a much smaller market.
[00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:41.020]   Not on the iPhone.
[00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:42.380]   But on the desktop.
[00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:43.380]   Just buy a valve.
[00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:43.660]   Apple.
[00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:44.300]   Apple just buy a valve.
[00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:45.540]   They have money.
[00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:47.980]   Apple has this thing called arcade.
[00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:49.820]   In arcade, they just pay people to develop--
[00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:52.060]   Yeah, but arcade doesn't need to look like that.
[00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:52.540]   Does it?
[00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:53.300]   It's casual, OK.
[00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:54.940]   But I'm saying if they--
[00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:56.260]   but Apple already has relationships
[00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:57.140]   with a lot of developers.
[00:28:57.140 --> 00:28:58.900]   If they just said, hey, the developer may not
[00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:00.660]   commit to the hardware, but Apple could just say,
[00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:03.540]   how about we just give you $20 million to do this?
[00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:04.780]   And then they'll go, OK.
[00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:05.780]   I'm so glad I have you.
[00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:07.740]   I have the opinion that if you want to be mobile,
[00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:09.580]   if you want battery life, there's
[00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:11.300]   no question they have one superior.
[00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:12.500]   If you're on the desktop, then it's
[00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:14.300]   a much more complicated equation.
[00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:15.660]   If you want a thin enclosure, then,
[00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:17.020]   like if you want a really small device,
[00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:17.900]   then it's going to behoove you.
[00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:20.420]   Or you don't want loud fans or not heat.
[00:29:20.420 --> 00:29:23.660]   But if power is not an issue, then you really
[00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:26.820]   have to look at what your jobs are and what your software does
[00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:27.820]   and what software's going to offer.
[00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:29.660]   If you're hipster bougie like me, Leo, then you--
[00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:30.820]   It's great for the bougie.
[00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:31.340]   And I'm bougie.
[00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:32.540]   If you're not hipster bougie--
[00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:34.020]   I'm all bougie about it.
[00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:37.260]   I mean, you compare that Aurora, the ugliest, ugliest,
[00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:43.940]   thin PC tower ugly, ugly case, loud, obnoxious, rude.
[00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:45.540]   You've got to work on it a little bit.
[00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:46.700]   Like, you don't have time for that.
[00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:48.420]   Us hipster bougies don't have time for that, Leo.
[00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:49.380]   We buy a box.
[00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:50.580]   We put it down and we work.
[00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:52.340]   But there are people who say, I don't have time
[00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:54.380]   to sit watching these stuff render.
[00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:57.460]   So I'm going to buy the fastest PC I can.
[00:29:57.460 --> 00:30:00.100]   So I guess you know who you are.
[00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:03.900]   But it's a small sliver of the market.
[00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:05.740]   The other-- yeah, it's a tiny sliver of the market.
[00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:07.580]   The other thing that people--
[00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:09.700]   we've said several times, but I'll say it again.
[00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:13.460]   All the M1s, every one of them, single core performance
[00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:15.020]   is virtually identical, right?
[00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:17.300]   Because they're all running at the same clock speed.
[00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:18.460]   Yeah, they're all the same generation.
[00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:21.620]   So when I got the Mac Mini, that little Mac Mini,
[00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:25.300]   Dinky Mac Mini for $699, running the same clock
[00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:28.260]   speed as the Macs, as the Ultra.
[00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:29.220]   Yep, as the Ultra.
[00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:31.620]   Yep, it's a core for single core stuff.
[00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:33.660]   Now when my browser becomes multi-core,
[00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:36.060]   my email becomes multi-core, my opera.
[00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:37.860]   I mean, there's not much, right?
[00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:39.660]   Leo, if you're not running every Chrome tab
[00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:42.260]   on a separate GPU core already, there's nothing--
[00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:43.580]   Yeah, there's no help for me.
[00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:44.860]   Absolutely.
[00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:48.340]   So it's too bad because it's very, very complicated.
[00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:51.980]   But I will say, the people who are going to have the computers,
[00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:54.020]   they are still very small.
[00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:55.700]   The people who have the computers that aren't going
[00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:59.340]   to benefit from the M1, and again, that's
[00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:00.380]   a very, very small market.
[00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:01.780]   I know that when I'm doing this stuff,
[00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:04.780]   I'm doing like when I need four GPUs, the kind of stuff
[00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:06.860]   that I'm doing, there's like 100 people in the world.
[00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:07.700]   Yeah, I know.
[00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:09.220]   And so the thing is that--
[00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:11.260]   because I get-- I'm told that constantly when
[00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:12.740]   I'm talking to the developers, they're like, no one's
[00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:14.060]   doing that except for you.
[00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:20.340]   And so I think that we have to be careful of also
[00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:23.740]   the big meat of the market for a studio or something
[00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:25.540]   like that is going to be video-driven.
[00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:28.340]   It's going to be a different kind of 3D
[00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:32.180]   metashape is still a very sub 1 millionth of the market
[00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:34.340]   kind of size.
[00:31:34.340 --> 00:31:36.220]   And so those are the kind of things
[00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:39.980]   that what's more interesting is to see, for instance,
[00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:41.220]   the object capture stuff.
[00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:45.340]   The reason I want to test that is because that potentially
[00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:48.020]   is a middle market coming.
[00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:50.140]   And I think that that's going to be more interesting.
[00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:53.540]   And also, when we look at the reason that the GPU, having
[00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:56.220]   all that RAM is really important, is that if I want to render
[00:31:56.220 --> 00:31:59.180]   3D objects out of motion or final cut or whatever,
[00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:01.660]   that means that those are going to render really beautifully.
[00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:03.940]   And they can be very, very high detailed.
[00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:05.700]   And they can be inside of my video editor.
[00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:09.980]   And that's something that is not easy to do right now.
[00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:11.220]   So if you're going to get the max--
[00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:13.420]   I'm sorry, the ultra, you should get 128 gigs of RAM.
[00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:15.140]   You should get the max RAM.
[00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:16.860]   If you're going for an ultra, I would keep going.
[00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:17.820]   Yeah, I mean, all the way up.
[00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:18.780]   Max, yeah.
[00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:19.620]   Storage, maybe not.
[00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:22.460]   But get enough storage for your current product.
[00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:22.940]   You're making money off the machine,
[00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:25.020]   or you have so much money that you can just get the machine.
[00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:26.060]   Well, that's not even quite right,
[00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:28.220]   because if you're making money off the machine
[00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:29.820]   and times of the essence, it may not
[00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:31.220]   be the best machine for you.
[00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:33.020]   Again, it comes down to what you're doing.
[00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:34.540]   Well, for these workloads, like--
[00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:37.140]   Not all of these, not the kind of a grammetry.
[00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:38.100]   No, but the kind of grammetry--
[00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:39.740]   You've got to figure out--
[00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:40.420]   it's studio.
[00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:42.620]   So if you're Mary Spender, you're laughing.
[00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:45.340]   It's clearly defined in a very specific market.
[00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:47.100]   You don't want expandability, but you want something
[00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:48.860]   that's more than the Mac mini.
[00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:51.740]   It's a very narrow swath of very narrow swath.
[00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:54.460]   I'm only bringing it up because Apple's marketing
[00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:57.300]   would imply that it is somehow better than anything else
[00:32:57.300 --> 00:32:58.460]   ever written.
[00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:00.500]   And it really depends on what you're doing.
[00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:05.180]   And you need to be somewhat savvy at this point
[00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:07.540]   when you're buying Apple Silicon.
[00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:14.020]   But what I would like to do is test the rendering video,
[00:33:14.020 --> 00:33:15.540]   like, out of Final Cut.
[00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:16.820]   That should be really fast because it
[00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:18.260]   has a separate end to it.
[00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:20.340]   But I think that when we talk about it again,
[00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:21.420]   we have to remember that--
[00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:22.820]   If you're using ProRes--
[00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:23.540]   --it's a grammetry.
[00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:24.300]   Yeah.
[00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:28.060]   But if you're using ProRes, you should get it because--
[00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:30.300]   But ProRes is an Apple technology.
[00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:32.020]   That's using the PC and basically--
[00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:32.620]   It's widely used now.
[00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:34.300]   If I'm talking to pretty much anybody in the--
[00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:34.700]   Everybody does.
[00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:36.420]   --in Hollywood, I go, what would you like me to deliver?
[00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:37.460]   And they go, it's all ProRes.
[00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:37.960]   Yeah.
[00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:38.700]   So it's--
[00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:39.860]   Yeah.
[00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:40.860]   So--
[00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:42.700]   If you're doing ProRes, because of those playback--
[00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:43.180]   I mean--
[00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:44.140]   You get DNx.
[00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:44.540]   You get DNx.
[00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:47.740]   No, no, it's just what everybody has.
[00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:49.180]   There's DNx for Avid.
[00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:51.260]   And some people will still ask for that.
[00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:52.940]   But it's pretty rare, like at this point.
[00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:53.860]   Usually when we're--
[00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:54.540]   But I'm saying--
[00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:55.740]   --in companies, it's for us.
[00:33:55.740 --> 00:33:57.900]   If you're going to use ProRes, the Ultra
[00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:00.260]   is the way to go because of the playback.
[00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:05.100]   No, the Max has the same ProRes chip, I believe.
[00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:06.420]   So I think that's there.
[00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:07.420]   And it's not just playback.
[00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:08.420]   It's not--
[00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:09.420]   It doesn't have twice.
[00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:10.420]   It doesn't have two of them.
[00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:11.420]   It only has one of them.
[00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:12.620]   So yeah, so if you're going to do a lot of rendering out
[00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:13.660]   of video, absolutely.
[00:34:13.660 --> 00:34:14.660]   And the thing is--
[00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:15.220]   Well, wait a minute, though.
[00:34:15.220 --> 00:34:16.540]   Does it split the task?
[00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:17.540]   Because--
[00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:20.340]   Or is that just good if you're playing two 8 streams?
[00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:20.840]   Well, I know.
[00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:22.260]   It's about 1.5x.
[00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:24.140]   It's not perfectly linear because it's
[00:34:24.140 --> 00:34:26.180]   got a dispatch between the different engines.
[00:34:26.180 --> 00:34:28.300]   But it is able to dispatch between the two engines.
[00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:28.580]   Oh, yeah.
[00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:29.100]   Compressor.
[00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:30.700]   If you're handing it to Compressor,
[00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:31.740]   we'll just look at all the--
[00:34:31.740 --> 00:34:32.780]   I don't know how other ones do it.
[00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:34.540]   But Compressor, we'll look at everything you have
[00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:36.540]   to separate that out into separate pieces.
[00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:39.620]   And then we'll have to subtract the band in Premiere
[00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:40.860]   because he's going to get the Ultra.
[00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:41.860]   And--
[00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:43.380]   We haven't tested it yet.
[00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:44.380]   So I don't know.
[00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:46.020]   But I will say that--
[00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:48.140]   You want to be a GPO where, like, last year,
[00:34:48.140 --> 00:34:49.860]   like they're still running to catch up on one day.
[00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:51.220]   Well, the order's at three months out,
[00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:52.980]   so there's play time.
[00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:54.300]   Well, I'll find out.
[00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:57.020]   And the main thing is that that is a big deal.
[00:34:57.020 --> 00:35:00.740]   Like the rendering of ProRes or DNx or whatever you're doing
[00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:03.020]   is a big deal because it takes a long--
[00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:03.860]   playback is fine.
[00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:04.860]   Like, I don't know.
[00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:05.860]   I can do x number of 8K.
[00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:07.140]   I don't know when I'm going to do that.
[00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:11.460]   But what I will say is that I have projects that take me
[00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:15.140]   an hour to render out a final cut, or an hour and a half
[00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:16.180]   to render out a resolve.
[00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:19.540]   So having something that is optimized to write that out
[00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:20.620]   is pretty exciting.
[00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:23.100]   And the drive speed, by the way, is really important.
[00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:24.260]   The internal drive speed would be--
[00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:24.780]   And it's very fast.
[00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:25.660]   Incredibly fast.
[00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:27.860]   Because that's usually the number one
[00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:31.180]   limiter to the render time is actually that render out.
[00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:31.660]   Yeah.
[00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:33.580]   I'm guessing a lot of people will buy a Mac studio.
[00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:36.020]   Just because it's elegant.
[00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:39.300]   It's a great, beautiful solution with all the ports you want.
[00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:40.420]   It's quiet.
[00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:41.580]   Fans never go up.
[00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:43.220]   They never go to Mac users.
[00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:44.660]   I mean, the thing is--
[00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:46.540]   You have to have Mac users not feel like they're falling too
[00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:48.820]   far behind is really the only key because they don't really
[00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:50.140]   want to use the PCs.
[00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:51.740]   Like, when I have to do PC stuff, I
[00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:55.740]   mean, I have somebody else in the company do it most of the time.
[00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:57.660]   And I think there's a very specific reason
[00:35:57.660 --> 00:36:00.500]   why Apple decided to call this the studio the first time
[00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:01.900]   they've used a name like that.
[00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:04.860]   I really think that they're trying to appeal to the creators,
[00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:06.780]   the people of YouTube channels, the people who do lots
[00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:10.580]   and lots of streaming, who probably acknowledge to themselves
[00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:14.300]   they're not quite so fancy enough to justify a Mac Pro.
[00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:16.660]   But they're telling themselves that their needs far exceed
[00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:17.780]   that of a Mac Mini.
[00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:19.380]   I mean, I myself during the--
[00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:21.140]   By the end of the presentation, I was tweeting, oh my god,
[00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:24.380]   this is exactly what I've been looking for in a desktop Mac,
[00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:27.940]   forgetting that the Mac Mini still exists, that probably they're
[00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:29.820]   not terminating the entire product line.
[00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:32.380]   It's very, very likely that by the time they introduce one,
[00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:35.460]   they will introduce a Mac Mini that addresses my one problem
[00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:37.860]   with the M1 Mac Mini, which is the lack of output.
[00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:39.060]   Right.
[00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:40.860]   And we have to remember that in the social world--
[00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:42.780]   I mean, I don't know all of the social world,
[00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:46.180]   but I do a lot of consulting that deals with social folks
[00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:49.420]   that creators and the vast majority that we run into
[00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:50.900]   are using Final Cut.
[00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:52.740]   Now, the only ones that use Premiere
[00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:54.060]   are the one that uses anything else.
[00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:54.820]   It's Final Cut a Premiere.
[00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:56.500]   And some of them are playing with Resolve.
[00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:58.780]   But it's generally Final Cut and Premiere.
[00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:01.460]   And it's like 90% Final Cut, because the only people
[00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:03.060]   that are using Premiere are like, oh, someday I'll work
[00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:03.980]   in Hollywood as an editor.
[00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:04.980]   I'm trying to figure out why.
[00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:05.660]   Good job somewhere.
[00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:08.980]   Why Hank chose Premiere to be honest with you.
[00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:10.500]   I don't know why he's not using Final Cut.
[00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:11.380]   We even have a--
[00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:11.900]   You could use--
[00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:13.100]   I mean, if you're using After Effects,
[00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:14.420]   you've got to like these for me.
[00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:14.980]   Yeah.
[00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:16.420]   After Effects is still amazing.
[00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:16.940]   Yeah.
[00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:17.860]   Yeah, After Effects is amazing.
[00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:20.140]   And it ties into Premiere really nicely.
[00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:23.820]   And there's the ecosystem that Adobe provides for you.
[00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:25.700]   I will admit that I'm not a huge fan.
[00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:27.620]   I haven't used Premiere for a long time.
[00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:29.060]   Well, that because he works with us,
[00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:31.740]   and we use Premiere in all of our editors use Premiere on PCs.
[00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:32.220]   Right.
[00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:33.460]   But one thing that's nice about it, though,
[00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:35.100]   like in general, video workloads.
[00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:37.100]   A lot of-- like, we'll make a video and people go, oh my god,
[00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:38.340]   you're testing video again.
[00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:39.060]   You have a YouTube channel.
[00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:41.060]   Can't you just build WebKit for me once?
[00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:43.420]   But the nice thing about video is that it really
[00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:46.260]   is one of the few workloads that hits as many transistors
[00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:47.100]   as possible.
[00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:49.220]   Because you have the CPU managing everything
[00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:50.740]   and also doing any gnarly codecs
[00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:52.420]   like you're pulling off your Sony camera.
[00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:55.100]   You have the ProRes, the H.264, all those engines.
[00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:57.900]   The GPU's doing all the effects, plug-ins, and layers.
[00:37:57.900 --> 00:37:59.300]   Now the neural networks are doing it.
[00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:01.220]   Like, the final cut Pro is in beta.
[00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:03.540]   It's got all these new features for audio suppression
[00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:05.140]   and tracking and just a lot of stuff
[00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:06.780]   that really leverages neural networks.
[00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:08.580]   And you can light up the entire chip
[00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:10.260]   and really see how it handles that.
[00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:13.100]   So it's not-- if you target creative ProRes
[00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:15.540]   or doing video work, you sort of bring in audio ProRes
[00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:17.540]   and a bunch of other special effects people at the same time.
[00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:21.580]   Well, and it's a much broader base than photogrammetry.
[00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:23.540]   There are a hell of a lot more people doing video.
[00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:26.780]   There's no photogrammetry to talk yet, but it's getting there.
[00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:32.860]   It is telling that Apple seeded review units of this.
[00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:34.300]   In fact, Jason Snow was--
[00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:40.460]   he got a max and a lot of much smaller, much less known
[00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:43.620]   YouTube channels got Altras for review.
[00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:46.140]   And that's exactly because that's the audience.
[00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:47.620]   I mean, I think it completely confirms
[00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:49.660]   that's exactly why the audience Apple wants.
[00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:50.940]   And they're going to see the biggest difference
[00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:51.540]   in their tests.
[00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:52.540]   Right.
[00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:55.540]   And Apple spends a lot of time paying attention
[00:38:55.540 --> 00:38:58.540]   to social creators because a lot of them are using it.
[00:38:58.540 --> 00:39:00.540]   And I think that it's--
[00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:04.220]   that's what-- when we had Justine's blog university,
[00:39:04.220 --> 00:39:07.060]   there was a lot of-- Apple was there.
[00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:08.540]   Of course it was.
[00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:09.540]   Of course it was.
[00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:10.980]   That's a huge market.
[00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:12.540]   But it's a much bigger market than broadcast.
[00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:15.140]   I mean, there's a-- people get enamored by the idea
[00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:17.020]   that broadcast is what they should be paying attention to.
[00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:18.260]   But that's a tiny market.
[00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:19.740]   And they're finicky and difficult to deal with.
[00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:20.540]   I'm one of them.
[00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:21.740]   You know, like, we're difficult.
[00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:23.540]   You know, and we have weird things
[00:39:23.540 --> 00:39:24.660]   that we want to do with your hardware.
[00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:25.380]   And so that's--
[00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:26.420]   That's not the market.
[00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:29.100]   Probably celebrating the fact that YouTube and TikTok
[00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:31.980]   and Instagram stories exist because that's
[00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:35.140]   created a massive market for Mac and what they're making.
[00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:36.540]   Oh, yeah.
[00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:38.620]   It's sort of half of one half of the other.
[00:39:38.620 --> 00:39:43.580]   On the one hand, when a professional like Alex
[00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:45.700]   looks at a product, he really gets down.
[00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:48.340]   He will not be fooled by anything.
[00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:50.740]   Because he knows exactly what's going on.
[00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:52.100]   He knows that, well, this is interesting,
[00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:53.500]   but it's not really significant.
[00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:55.060]   They haven't really changed the workflow.
[00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:57.660]   This really isn't anything very, very different.
[00:39:57.660 --> 00:40:00.220]   And so on that way, the professionals
[00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:01.500]   are actually giving the best reviews.
[00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:02.820]   But on the flip side, the creators
[00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:04.340]   are probably the people who are more likely
[00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:05.540]   to be doing typical things.
[00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:09.180]   So I'm very much a fan of the, wow, yes,
[00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:11.100]   this is a terrible, terrible problem
[00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:14.500]   if you're one of very, very few people who actually are
[00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:15.740]   doing this kind of--
[00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:16.940]   if you're one of the few people who
[00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:19.300]   have to do photogrammetry on this kind of a time crunch,
[00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:22.020]   for somebody like me who's just doing a 4K video three times
[00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:24.900]   a week, oh my god, this is freed up so much my time.
[00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:25.900]   Yeah.
[00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:26.980]   Hey, I want to take a little break.
[00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:27.820]   We'll come back to this.
[00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:29.260]   There's lots more to talk about.
[00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:31.540]   I got to find out what Renee has learned from Apple,
[00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:32.740]   and by the way.
[00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:35.820]   But first, I want to show you my new wardrobe.
[00:40:35.820 --> 00:40:37.580]   Oh, my buck Mason is here.
[00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:39.460]   I'm so excited.
[00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:42.340]   Buck Mason, we all have our favorite go-tos, right?
[00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:43.980]   Shirts, sweater, jeans, especially now,
[00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:45.620]   since we can work from home.
[00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:47.700]   The stuff you wear all the time.
[00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:50.180]   My go-tos, they're all from Buck Mason.
[00:40:50.180 --> 00:40:53.020]   And I just got my new shipment of Buck Mason.
[00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:54.700]   Beautiful gear.
[00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:56.700]   Here's a curved hem hemely.
[00:40:56.700 --> 00:41:00.020]   Buck's famous for the curved hem, by the way.
[00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:06.020]   The curved hem T, GQ calls it the best T-shirt in the game.
[00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:08.660]   Gorgeous, gorgeous stuff.
[00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:09.420]   They're timeless.
[00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:10.860]   They never go out of style.
[00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:13.300]   And the most important thing to me
[00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:15.900]   is they're very well made.
[00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:18.740]   I love the tailored look and fit of their T-shirts.
[00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:21.980]   Even if you wash them again and again and again,
[00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:25.260]   they're going to look and fit just as good as the first day
[00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:25.780]   they came.
[00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:27.900]   I've got my sweat suit here.
[00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:30.180]   Here's my buck Mason jeans.
[00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:31.580]   Comfortable.
[00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:33.900]   Should I take them out of the--
[00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:34.860]   I've been saving these.
[00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:37.620]   I've been kind of waiting for these ad to open the box.
[00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:39.020]   So--
[00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:40.780]   because I wanted my new stuff.
[00:41:40.780 --> 00:41:42.980]   I want my new buck Mason's stuff.
[00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:43.500]   Here are.
[00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:45.220]   These are comfy.
[00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:47.580]   This is what I really like to wear.
[00:41:47.580 --> 00:41:51.460]   Soft, expandable waistline.
[00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:55.020]   For certain of us, that's an important feature.
[00:41:55.020 --> 00:41:56.620]   These are sweats that don't look like sweats.
[00:41:56.620 --> 00:41:57.860]   They look nice.
[00:41:57.860 --> 00:42:01.460]   They even have a fly, a pseudo fly.
[00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:03.860]   So people won't know you're not wearing dress pants.
[00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:05.020]   I love the hoodies.
[00:42:05.020 --> 00:42:06.460]   Got a beautiful buck Mason hoodie.
[00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:09.020]   Let me show you this curved hem T.
[00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:12.380]   Because I think that's an important feature of buck Mason.
[00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:17.620]   buckmason.com/macbreak.
[00:42:17.620 --> 00:42:18.420]   I want you to try them.
[00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:20.100]   They're going to become your go-tos.
[00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:20.900]   Because they're soft.
[00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:21.860]   They're comfortable.
[00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:23.300]   They're well made.
[00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:25.540]   They last and last and last.
[00:42:25.540 --> 00:42:28.420]   You will never find a better T-shirt than this.
[00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:29.340]   Look at this.
[00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:31.740]   With a curved hem.
[00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:32.700]   It's so great.
[00:42:32.700 --> 00:42:35.460]   My son yells at me when I tuck in anything.
[00:42:35.460 --> 00:42:37.580]   He says, Dad, you look like a dad.
[00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:38.620]   I am a dad.
[00:42:38.620 --> 00:42:40.900]   So I don't when I'm around him.
[00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:42.060]   I wear my buck masons.
[00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:43.380]   And he says, Dad, you're looking sharp.
[00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:43.940]   You're looking good.
[00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:44.500]   Look at that.
[00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:46.060]   That's the curved hem.
[00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:48.060]   Best T-shirt in the game.
[00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:50.460]   Oh, I wish you could feel this too.
[00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:51.780]   So soft.
[00:42:51.780 --> 00:42:52.460]   They make jeans.
[00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:53.020]   They make shirts.
[00:42:53.020 --> 00:42:53.740]   They make jackets.
[00:42:53.740 --> 00:42:55.300]   They make all your go-tos.
[00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:56.740]   They look great.
[00:42:56.740 --> 00:42:59.060]   Actually, that's the next thing I'm getting, by the way.
[00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:01.340]   That canyon suede bomber.
[00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:02.140]   Can't wait.
[00:43:02.140 --> 00:43:03.380]   That is a gorgeous jacket.
[00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:05.180]   Once you try buck Mason, you'll be like me.
[00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:07.100]   It'll be your go-to.
[00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:09.940]   Yes, they have clothes for women too.
[00:43:09.940 --> 00:43:16.860]   Men and women, boys and girls, go to buckmason.com/macbreak.
[00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:20.660]   You will get a free T-shirt with your first order,
[00:43:20.660 --> 00:43:22.860]   because they know you will be hooked.
[00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:27.380]   B-U-C-K-M-A-S-O-N.
[00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:30.300]   buckmason.com/macbreak.
[00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:32.980]   Get a free T-shirt with your first order.
[00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:35.860]   Oh, buck Mason.
[00:43:35.860 --> 00:43:38.580]   And if you can work from home, and you're going to live in these,
[00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:39.420]   you're going to live in these.
[00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:45.220]   I might stop wearing blazers and just start wearing my canyon bomber.
[00:43:45.220 --> 00:43:46.060]   Love it.
[00:43:46.060 --> 00:43:46.900]   Buck Mason.
[00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:48.060]   Thank you, buck.
[00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:53.900]   Buckmason.com/macbreak.
[00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:54.860]   Let's see here.
[00:43:54.860 --> 00:44:00.460]   Were you gone for briefings, Renee?
[00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:01.620]   Can you even talk about it?
[00:44:01.620 --> 00:44:03.140]   Is it secret?
[00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:05.260]   Usually, it's a mix of things.
[00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:08.620]   Usually after the event, if you get review units from Apple,
[00:44:08.620 --> 00:44:10.260]   they want to talk to you before they send them to you.
[00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:11.500]   Yeah.
[00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:13.740]   So did you learn anything?
[00:44:13.740 --> 00:44:19.380]   For instance, did they tell you that there's an iPhone in your monitor?
[00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:20.380]   No.
[00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:22.180]   They just talked about A13.
[00:44:22.180 --> 00:44:28.140]   And the features, they don't get into the plumbing very often.
[00:44:28.140 --> 00:44:29.660]   They don't do it on mass briefing.
[00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:32.860]   It's actually running iOS 15.4.
[00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:33.900]   Yeah.
[00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:34.420]   Yeah.
[00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:39.620]   It's basically all it's doing is the Yo-Gimbo, the Yo-Series stuff.
[00:44:39.620 --> 00:44:43.180]   It's doing the audio processing for the microphones.
[00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:43.980]   And the center stage.
[00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:45.380]   And it's in the center stage.
[00:44:45.380 --> 00:44:46.140]   Yeah.
[00:44:46.140 --> 00:44:52.020]   So do you see that people have looked at an output to say it's only using two gigs of that storage?
[00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:54.100]   But again, you got this as someone in the chip.
[00:44:54.100 --> 00:44:57.340]   The other reason it's good to have 64 gigs is it could update itself.
[00:44:57.340 --> 00:44:58.500]   Although apparently it doesn't.
[00:44:58.500 --> 00:45:01.540]   You have to use the Mac to do the update.
[00:45:01.540 --> 00:45:03.020]   Yeah.
[00:45:03.020 --> 00:45:07.780]   I was just going to say, do you see that someone on Twitter dumped the DMG of the system image
[00:45:07.780 --> 00:45:08.780]   for that?
[00:45:08.780 --> 00:45:11.300]   And so they found the recovery mode screen for the monitor.
[00:45:11.300 --> 00:45:13.860]   No, I have to find that.
[00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:14.860]   Sorry.
[00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:17.220]   I put in the show notes.
[00:45:17.220 --> 00:45:18.500]   I love it.
[00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:21.100]   I love it.
[00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:22.700]   But it's so easy to think that I see.
[00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:23.700]   Doesn't that look good?
[00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:24.700]   That's a sharp.
[00:45:24.700 --> 00:45:25.700]   There you go.
[00:45:25.700 --> 00:45:26.700]   It's a sharp hoodie.
[00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:27.700]   I don't like that.
[00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:28.700]   I'm not a smart guy.
[00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:30.860]   You and Renee are both like the cool kids with hoodies.
[00:45:30.860 --> 00:45:32.700]   And I'm not doing the work shirt.
[00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:35.100]   I'm like, I'll get you some book masons.
[00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:36.100]   I'll get you some books.
[00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:37.100]   Come on.
[00:45:37.100 --> 00:45:38.100]   You're adorable.
[00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:39.100]   This is the one I'm not going to.
[00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:40.100]   Thank you.
[00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:41.100]   I'm not going to wear to work.
[00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:43.220]   I'm a sucker for white shirts.
[00:45:43.220 --> 00:45:45.500]   But man, that looks so good.
[00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:46.820]   You could clean a nanotextered display with it.
[00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:47.820]   That's the problem.
[00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:53.860]   I'm also a sucker for spaghetti and white shirts and tomato sauce.
[00:45:53.860 --> 00:45:55.780]   Oh, man, though.
[00:45:55.780 --> 00:45:56.780]   I'm going to wear this.
[00:45:56.780 --> 00:45:58.100]   I don't know.
[00:45:58.100 --> 00:45:59.100]   Next time I'm in a wedding.
[00:45:59.100 --> 00:46:00.100]   I don't know.
[00:46:00.100 --> 00:46:01.100]   Isn't it?
[00:46:01.100 --> 00:46:02.100]   Gorgeous.
[00:46:02.100 --> 00:46:04.500]   I'm going to say Sharpie and draw a bow tie on it.
[00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:06.420]   I've done that.
[00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:08.980]   So is it-- what line number is the tweet?
[00:46:08.980 --> 00:46:09.980]   Because I would like to--
[00:46:09.980 --> 00:46:10.980]   That would be--
[00:46:10.980 --> 00:46:11.980]   Oh, there it is.
[00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:12.980]   I see it.
[00:46:12.980 --> 00:46:15.300]   Martin Noble.
[00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:21.700]   The recovery-- this is the thing you do not want to see.
[00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:23.420]   And I'm going to be honest, Renee.
[00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:24.940]   It's one of the reasons I cancel this.
[00:46:24.940 --> 00:46:27.340]   I don't want an operating system in my monitor.
[00:46:27.340 --> 00:46:28.340]   Yeah.
[00:46:28.340 --> 00:46:30.340]   Well, it depends.
[00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:31.340]   It depends.
[00:46:31.340 --> 00:46:34.700]   If it means that, like, on my Dell display,
[00:46:34.700 --> 00:46:37.820]   I have had half hour instance of frustration.
[00:46:37.820 --> 00:46:41.340]   Because you're everything where you only get the screen.
[00:46:41.340 --> 00:46:43.660]   Yes, you are plugged into a display for it.
[00:46:43.660 --> 00:46:44.660]   Oh, look.
[00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:45.660]   I'm going to--
[00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:48.620]   So if they use that to say, hi, here's explicit.
[00:46:48.620 --> 00:46:50.780]   If you're seeing the screen and you're not expecting to see
[00:46:50.780 --> 00:46:53.220]   the screen, here's some information that I can give you
[00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:54.780]   because I am a working operating system
[00:46:54.780 --> 00:46:56.820]   and I can do a self-diagnostic.
[00:46:56.820 --> 00:46:59.020]   I'll also gently point out that I have a display here
[00:46:59.020 --> 00:46:59.940]   that runs Mac OS.
[00:46:59.940 --> 00:47:02.100]   And I have a display here that runs WebOS.
[00:47:02.100 --> 00:47:03.860]   So I'm just a West all over my displays.
[00:47:03.860 --> 00:47:04.860]   Yeah.
[00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:06.620]   Well, if I could buy a TV--
[00:47:06.620 --> 00:47:08.020]   I love my LG TVs.
[00:47:08.020 --> 00:47:10.500]   If I could buy a TV that didn't have WebOS,
[00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:11.420]   there was just a monitor.
[00:47:11.420 --> 00:47:11.940]   I would.
[00:47:11.940 --> 00:47:13.420]   There's a little WebOS birds.
[00:47:13.420 --> 00:47:14.340]   They're so cute.
[00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:17.020]   Well, at least I can buy a monitor that
[00:47:17.020 --> 00:47:18.940]   doesn't have an operating system.
[00:47:18.940 --> 00:47:20.140]   They haven't bedded Linux or something.
[00:47:20.140 --> 00:47:21.340]   They've got to be running something in there.
[00:47:21.340 --> 00:47:22.140]   It's got to be like a--
[00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:23.220]   Oh, what do you mean?
[00:47:23.220 --> 00:47:26.180]   I think that the ability to also do things
[00:47:26.180 --> 00:47:28.100]   like just share to the monitor without having to deal
[00:47:28.100 --> 00:47:30.340]   with the computer and how to enter into whatever.
[00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:31.500]   They put all that hardware.
[00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:33.260]   But you can't do any of that.
[00:47:33.260 --> 00:47:34.380]   I filed radars for that.
[00:47:34.380 --> 00:47:37.740]   I filed radars for stereo pairing, if you have two displays.
[00:47:37.740 --> 00:47:41.340]   Also for sidecar and for airplay without a Mac.
[00:47:41.340 --> 00:47:42.020]   So I just want to go--
[00:47:42.020 --> 00:47:42.940]   This is a radar.
[00:47:42.940 --> 00:47:44.060]   It's not a bug radar.
[00:47:44.060 --> 00:47:46.100]   This is a request for a feature request.
[00:47:46.100 --> 00:47:47.100]   Yeah.
[00:47:47.100 --> 00:47:48.100]   Yeah.
[00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:51.980]   I still feel like, especially with 64 gigs of RAM, maybe not.
[00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:54.700]   But sure seems like there's a lot of smoke in that area.
[00:47:54.700 --> 00:47:56.260]   64 gigs of SSD.
[00:47:56.260 --> 00:47:57.180]   The RAM is lower.
[00:47:57.180 --> 00:47:58.180]   I'm sorry, not RAM.
[00:47:58.180 --> 00:47:59.180]   But storage.
[00:47:59.180 --> 00:48:01.380]   But I mean, 64 gigs of--
[00:48:01.380 --> 00:48:04.020]   I'm just saying, I'm not saying that there's a fire.
[00:48:04.020 --> 00:48:06.060]   I'm just saying there's a lot of smoke.
[00:48:06.060 --> 00:48:10.380]   Well, that is just an interesting, I don't know,
[00:48:10.380 --> 00:48:12.660]   sociological thing, where if they
[00:48:12.660 --> 00:48:16.380]   managed to put all that stuff behind a blob of black plastic
[00:48:16.380 --> 00:48:18.380]   like on the back of most things and nobody who
[00:48:18.380 --> 00:48:20.100]   did the teardown could sense that, hey, wait a minute.
[00:48:20.100 --> 00:48:22.180]   Look at everything that's in here.
[00:48:22.180 --> 00:48:23.860]   Now that people know that there's
[00:48:23.860 --> 00:48:26.580]   essentially a full-featured iOS computer in here,
[00:48:26.580 --> 00:48:28.900]   are people going to be disappointed if they buy this
[00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:30.220]   and on their own initiative?
[00:48:30.220 --> 00:48:31.860]   They decide, hey, wait a minute.
[00:48:31.860 --> 00:48:33.940]   This thing is capable of being an AirPlay target.
[00:48:33.940 --> 00:48:35.340]   Why isn't this an AirPlay target?
[00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:36.700]   Hey, this can run iOS apps.
[00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:38.740]   Why isn't this running iOS apps?
[00:48:38.740 --> 00:48:40.620]   I think that's what's happening right now.
[00:48:40.620 --> 00:48:43.460]   And yeah, hey, you know what?
[00:48:43.460 --> 00:48:45.500]   If they turn that on, I will buy it.
[00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:46.460]   But until they do--
[00:48:46.460 --> 00:48:47.260]   You know what, Leo?
[00:48:47.260 --> 00:48:49.860]   Like AirPods run, audio S and Apple has upgraded that
[00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:50.580]   several times.
[00:48:50.580 --> 00:48:52.700]   Like they've added a space of audio and a bunch of other
[00:48:52.700 --> 00:48:53.260]   features.
[00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:54.500]   The interesting thing of these were the first
[00:48:54.500 --> 00:48:56.100]   upgradeable displays.
[00:48:56.100 --> 00:48:58.060]   All of a sudden, like WWC comes out and goes,
[00:48:58.060 --> 00:49:00.220]   here's direct, direct point-of-point AirPlay.
[00:49:00.220 --> 00:49:00.820]   Enjoy.
[00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:01.740]   Yeah.
[00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:04.220]   And the point is, regardless of what they're planning to do
[00:49:04.220 --> 00:49:06.700]   in the immediate future, putting that chip in with some
[00:49:06.700 --> 00:49:09.700]   storage means that they can do all kinds of things in the
[00:49:09.700 --> 00:49:09.980]   future.
[00:49:09.980 --> 00:49:11.940]   The problem you really get into when you buy hardware is
[00:49:11.940 --> 00:49:13.700]   you're now committing to it, especially a monitor.
[00:49:13.700 --> 00:49:14.820]   You're going to keep for a long time.
[00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:16.940]   And so having something in there that at this point
[00:49:16.940 --> 00:49:20.780]   doesn't cost them very much to add, they add that to it.
[00:49:20.780 --> 00:49:22.580]   And now they can do all kinds of things in the future.
[00:49:22.580 --> 00:49:23.020]   Really?
[00:49:23.020 --> 00:49:25.500]   So that's what German was saying is don't expect that Apple
[00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:26.180]   never does that.
[00:49:26.180 --> 00:49:29.300]   And I think Renee was kind of saying that, too, do you
[00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:31.140]   really think that it's a possibility?
[00:49:31.140 --> 00:49:31.940]   They're going to come along.
[00:49:31.940 --> 00:49:33.500]   I didn't think they'd ever upgrade AirPods.
[00:49:33.500 --> 00:49:35.660]   Whoever heard us first, your headset upgraded.
[00:49:35.660 --> 00:49:36.060]   And they could--
[00:49:36.060 --> 00:49:37.860]   Yeah, just because Apple's never done something doesn't
[00:49:37.860 --> 00:49:39.180]   mean they won't do it because they've--
[00:49:39.180 --> 00:49:40.740]   Well, done that before.
[00:49:40.740 --> 00:49:43.540]   You also have to look at that they may want to be able to
[00:49:43.540 --> 00:49:46.660]   tell you that this works all the way back to some certain
[00:49:46.660 --> 00:49:47.700]   date, right?
[00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:51.060]   So for instance, the ultra wideband chips were being added
[00:49:51.060 --> 00:49:53.380]   for a long time without even talking about them.
[00:49:53.380 --> 00:49:56.820]   You know, like they're just being put into the phones
[00:49:56.820 --> 00:49:57.780]   because it allows them.
[00:49:57.780 --> 00:50:01.940]   And then like HDR, there's a lot of things in HDR and at most
[00:50:01.940 --> 00:50:05.620]   process and so on and so forth that was being added to the
[00:50:05.620 --> 00:50:07.180]   hardware for a long time.
[00:50:07.180 --> 00:50:10.860]   Because now what you can say is we now have 100--
[00:50:10.860 --> 00:50:11.980]   there's another value to Apple.
[00:50:11.980 --> 00:50:14.980]   Being able to tell partners, I've got 100 million people.
[00:50:14.980 --> 00:50:16.860]   There are 200 million people that can use this technology
[00:50:16.860 --> 00:50:18.660]   is different than saying, well, we just started shipping
[00:50:18.660 --> 00:50:20.380]   and we're hoping that it goes well.
[00:50:20.380 --> 00:50:23.940]   I went to Alex's point, like this isn't an HDR panel the way
[00:50:23.940 --> 00:50:26.340]   that we think about it now, like with 1,000 nits of OLED or
[00:50:26.340 --> 00:50:27.300]   mini LED.
[00:50:27.300 --> 00:50:31.500]   But back with the 2017 iPads, Apple implemented the quasi
[00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:35.020]   dodgy LCD consortiums version of HDR.
[00:50:35.020 --> 00:50:36.580]   And this goes to 600 nits.
[00:50:36.580 --> 00:50:38.780]   And basically what it does is it lowers the base nits and
[00:50:38.780 --> 00:50:40.540]   then brightens them for the highlights.
[00:50:40.540 --> 00:50:43.500]   It can't get the blacks, but it takes HDR source.
[00:50:43.500 --> 00:50:46.100]   Like the Apple TV plus stuff is the HDR source.
[00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:48.940]   If you airdrop HDR from your iPhone, it takes the HDR tone
[00:50:48.940 --> 00:50:51.300]   map and then it does what they call EDR where it just
[00:50:51.300 --> 00:50:53.900]   extends-- it pulls as much dynamic range out of it as it
[00:50:53.900 --> 00:50:54.380]   can.
[00:50:54.380 --> 00:50:56.460]   It's better than a lot of really cheap HDR.
[00:50:56.460 --> 00:50:59.220]   Without local dimming, that is not HDR.
[00:50:59.220 --> 00:51:00.260]   I'm sorry.
[00:51:00.260 --> 00:51:01.260]   I did.
[00:51:01.260 --> 00:51:01.260]   I did.
[00:51:01.260 --> 00:51:02.260]   I get a black black.
[00:51:02.260 --> 00:51:03.220]   That ain't HDR.
[00:51:03.220 --> 00:51:04.020]   I'm sorry.
[00:51:04.020 --> 00:51:06.740]   They call it EDR, but it gives you much better than an
[00:51:06.740 --> 00:51:08.220]   SDR LCD panel.
[00:51:08.220 --> 00:51:09.420]   We'll give you.
[00:51:09.420 --> 00:51:13.020]   And I will say that Apple's tone mapping is exceptional,
[00:51:13.020 --> 00:51:14.660]   even to things that are SDR.
[00:51:14.660 --> 00:51:17.020]   So they do a pretty good job of them.
[00:51:17.020 --> 00:51:19.820]   I remember the days where people would go, that's not HDR.
[00:51:19.820 --> 00:51:21.540]   That's tone mapping.
[00:51:21.540 --> 00:51:25.460]   There was a big one, though, because about three years ago,
[00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:28.980]   or actually five years ago, HDR-- like OLED could get
[00:51:28.980 --> 00:51:31.140]   inky blacks, but they could not get bright at all.
[00:51:31.140 --> 00:51:33.140]   And LCD could get really bright, but they could not get
[00:51:33.140 --> 00:51:33.660]   black.
[00:51:33.660 --> 00:51:35.940]   And they were fighting over what the definition of HDR should
[00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:36.420]   be.
[00:51:36.420 --> 00:51:37.980]   Luckily, the right side won.
[00:51:37.980 --> 00:51:40.220]   The thing is, it has been solved.
[00:51:40.220 --> 00:51:42.420]   I mean, this is a monitor from two years ago.
[00:51:42.420 --> 00:51:43.980]   Well, it has been solved today.
[00:51:43.980 --> 00:51:44.820]   It's been solved.
[00:51:44.820 --> 00:51:45.780]   Well, that's not right.
[00:51:45.780 --> 00:51:46.780]   Right.
[00:51:46.780 --> 00:51:47.580]   OLED got bright.
[00:51:47.580 --> 00:51:49.300]   There's QLED.
[00:51:49.300 --> 00:51:52.740]   There's all sorts of technologies that bring these two
[00:51:52.740 --> 00:51:53.460]   together.
[00:51:53.460 --> 00:51:56.700]   So you can get a full array local dimming inexpensively on
[00:51:56.700 --> 00:52:00.100]   a TV, then get real HDR on your LCD.
[00:52:00.100 --> 00:52:01.780]   So you have to be careful of the--
[00:52:01.780 --> 00:52:04.060]   it's also what makes sense as a monitor.
[00:52:04.060 --> 00:52:06.860]   So there's a lot of things, for instance, OLED looks really,
[00:52:06.860 --> 00:52:10.580]   really great, but leave some white emails, like white
[00:52:10.580 --> 00:52:12.700]   back-grinds on your OLED for a little while.
[00:52:12.700 --> 00:52:14.580]   Like walk away for lunch and come back and, ooh, you're going
[00:52:14.580 --> 00:52:15.420]   to be really bummed.
[00:52:15.420 --> 00:52:18.500]   Because that-- and I've seen--
[00:52:18.500 --> 00:52:20.740]   we left a graphic-- I didn't leave it, but somebody will
[00:52:20.740 --> 00:52:24.420]   just say left a graphic on an OLED overnight.
[00:52:24.420 --> 00:52:26.660]   And that was the end of the monitor.
[00:52:26.660 --> 00:52:29.660]   So monitors are different beasts than TVs.
[00:52:29.660 --> 00:52:31.860]   So because we solved it with TVs, doesn't necessarily mean
[00:52:31.860 --> 00:52:33.380]   they're not good monitors.
[00:52:33.380 --> 00:52:36.660]   Although I have a beautiful 55-inch OLED monitor, my Alienware
[00:52:36.660 --> 00:52:39.220]   monitor, 120 hertz refresh rate is gorgeous.
[00:52:39.220 --> 00:52:40.100]   They're really nice.
[00:52:40.100 --> 00:52:43.940]   And I make sure it turns itself off after 15 minutes.
[00:52:43.940 --> 00:52:45.620]   I don't allow it to stay on.
[00:52:45.620 --> 00:52:47.300]   Oh, yeah, that was the other thing.
[00:52:47.300 --> 00:52:49.820]   Some people were upset you can't get 5K 120 hertz,
[00:52:49.820 --> 00:52:51.820]   but that's the limitation of Thunderbolt 4.
[00:52:51.820 --> 00:52:55.580]   It can do 4K 120 hertz, or 5K 60.
[00:52:55.580 --> 00:52:58.340]   The protocol will not go any faster than that
[00:52:58.340 --> 00:53:00.900]   until they ship DisplayPort 2.0 and Thunderbolt 5--
[00:53:00.900 --> 00:53:04.180]   So that's another question I have.
[00:53:04.180 --> 00:53:09.380]   I'm going to be putting this studio on that 120 hertz monitor.
[00:53:09.380 --> 00:53:10.220]   It's 4K.
[00:53:10.220 --> 00:53:11.060]   It's not 5K.
[00:53:11.060 --> 00:53:11.740]   Can it run it?
[00:53:11.740 --> 00:53:12.820]   Yeah, 4K, you're fine.
[00:53:12.820 --> 00:53:12.820]   Yeah.
[00:53:12.820 --> 00:53:13.820]   OK, good.
[00:53:13.820 --> 00:53:14.700]   Oh, that's great.
[00:53:14.700 --> 00:53:17.300]   I thought I might be limited to 60.
[00:53:17.300 --> 00:53:18.020]   OK, that's good.
[00:53:18.020 --> 00:53:18.340]   Yeah.
[00:53:18.340 --> 00:53:19.940]   All right.
[00:53:19.940 --> 00:53:21.860]   One other thing that just occurred to me
[00:53:21.860 --> 00:53:23.300]   that I wish there were possibly
[00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:26.340]   to do a tear down of the signal path of what
[00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:27.940]   the logic is doing inside there.
[00:53:27.940 --> 00:53:32.420]   Because it just occurred to me that iOS devices have
[00:53:32.420 --> 00:53:34.740]   an end of life designation, where at some point,
[00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:36.260]   no, we're not going to update the firm.
[00:53:36.260 --> 00:53:38.100]   We're not going to update the software for this anymore.
[00:53:38.100 --> 00:53:40.220]   So whatever it does right now, that's what it's going to do.
[00:53:40.220 --> 00:53:42.700]   Or whatever we do in the future, it's not going to work with it.
[00:53:42.700 --> 00:53:48.660]   Wouldn't it be terrible if it's not truly a display port,
[00:53:48.660 --> 00:53:52.220]   like a display, that at some point it needs the software to say,
[00:53:52.220 --> 00:53:53.900]   oh, yes, this is a valid device.
[00:53:53.900 --> 00:53:55.020]   I'm going to accept this signal and I'm
[00:53:55.020 --> 00:53:56.260]   going to put it on this panel.
[00:53:56.260 --> 00:53:57.980]   And in five years time, I'm going to say, oh, sorry.
[00:53:57.980 --> 00:53:58.980]   I know that you've got--
[00:53:58.980 --> 00:54:02.700]   I know that the HDMI TV that you're
[00:54:02.700 --> 00:54:06.060]   on won a church raffle 18 years ago still works today,
[00:54:06.060 --> 00:54:09.020]   but your five-year-old $1,500 Apple panel
[00:54:09.020 --> 00:54:10.980]   is no longer going to work because we don't want to update
[00:54:10.980 --> 00:54:11.980]   the software.
[00:54:11.980 --> 00:54:15.500]   If you have nothing, if you plug it in as a bare panel,
[00:54:15.500 --> 00:54:17.580]   you don't get the iOS stuff, obviously.
[00:54:17.580 --> 00:54:20.100]   You get just a basic webcam, basic speakers, basic mic.
[00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:21.540]   But you can plug it into anything,
[00:54:21.540 --> 00:54:23.980]   and it'll still work as a basic panel.
[00:54:23.980 --> 00:54:29.460]   I'm sorry what I mean is internally.
[00:54:29.460 --> 00:54:32.060]   I wish I had the language for this to make this--
[00:54:32.060 --> 00:54:33.060]   To say this efficiently.
[00:54:33.060 --> 00:54:35.580]   Is it a valid device?
[00:54:35.580 --> 00:54:41.140]   Meaning that is this a display port monitor
[00:54:41.140 --> 00:54:43.660]   that happens to have an iOS computer inside it
[00:54:43.660 --> 00:54:45.620]   that's adding extra features?
[00:54:45.620 --> 00:54:50.220]   Or is this an iOS computer that takes a display port input,
[00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:52.300]   runs it through an iOS thing?
[00:54:52.300 --> 00:54:52.940]   Right exactly.
[00:54:52.940 --> 00:54:54.140]   That's what I meant.
[00:54:54.140 --> 00:54:54.740]   Yeah.
[00:54:54.740 --> 00:54:56.580]   I don't think they'd pull that.
[00:54:56.580 --> 00:54:58.500]   But if there's one copy that would pull that,
[00:54:58.500 --> 00:54:59.020]   it would be up.
[00:54:59.020 --> 00:54:59.940]   It would pull that.
[00:54:59.940 --> 00:55:02.260]   It's often interesting because the home pods were iOS,
[00:55:02.260 --> 00:55:05.380]   and now they're home OS.
[00:55:05.380 --> 00:55:06.500]   Unofficially home OS.
[00:55:06.500 --> 00:55:08.460]   The AirPods are like unofficially audio OS.
[00:55:08.460 --> 00:55:10.940]   We seem to see if Apple develops on a panel OS.
[00:55:10.940 --> 00:55:13.660]   When they have enough of these like the next generation XDR
[00:55:13.660 --> 00:55:16.660]   that they just-- instead of putting the whole monolithic iOS
[00:55:16.660 --> 00:55:18.940]   build on this, they just like these are the parts we need.
[00:55:18.940 --> 00:55:20.980]   We're shipping this part now, and it's not going to have
[00:55:20.980 --> 00:55:23.460]   exactly what you're talking about, those sorts of update
[00:55:23.460 --> 00:55:26.340]   limits on it.
[00:55:26.340 --> 00:55:31.420]   Kerman says this is going to be a disappointment to many.
[00:55:31.420 --> 00:55:35.820]   The Apple MacBook Air refresh has been delayed till next year,
[00:55:35.820 --> 00:55:38.700]   and there will be no new MacBook Pro 14 or MacBook Pro
[00:55:38.700 --> 00:55:41.300]   16 models until next year.
[00:55:41.300 --> 00:55:42.380]   It's just chip shortage.
[00:55:42.380 --> 00:55:43.380]   Is german off?
[00:55:43.380 --> 00:55:44.340]   Is he right?
[00:55:44.340 --> 00:55:48.660]   Is this-- by the way, Renee, I told him about your german
[00:55:48.660 --> 00:55:49.020]   thesis.
[00:55:49.020 --> 00:55:51.620]   I watched.
[00:55:51.620 --> 00:55:52.340]   I watched.
[00:55:52.340 --> 00:55:55.460]   I believe he supported it.
[00:55:55.460 --> 00:55:57.420]   But when Mark says he thinks or he wants,
[00:55:57.420 --> 00:55:59.380]   like he wants routers, he says he wants routers.
[00:55:59.380 --> 00:56:01.700]   Yeah, those sources say new routers are coming.
[00:56:01.700 --> 00:56:03.100]   Then sources are telling him new routers.
[00:56:03.100 --> 00:56:06.380]   I always ignore stories that say things like, I want Apple,
[00:56:06.380 --> 00:56:08.020]   or here's what Apple should do.
[00:56:08.020 --> 00:56:11.660]   Because Apple's not listening, and it doesn't matter what you
[00:56:11.660 --> 00:56:13.300]   think Apple should do.
[00:56:13.300 --> 00:56:14.980]   I mean, maybe Apple should do routers.
[00:56:14.980 --> 00:56:16.460]   I don't know, but it doesn't matter.
[00:56:16.460 --> 00:56:19.140]   Apple wasn't going to do an iPad mini until I'm blanking on
[00:56:19.140 --> 00:56:23.700]   his name now, O'Brien from Gigah Ohm said, look how great
[00:56:23.700 --> 00:56:25.460]   this is, and he saw that and he goes, wait a minute.
[00:56:25.460 --> 00:56:27.380]   They're praising products that aren't ours.
[00:56:27.380 --> 00:56:28.380]   Oh, OK.
[00:56:28.380 --> 00:56:29.820]   Well, I have to thank him then because--
[00:56:29.820 --> 00:56:30.900]   Well, you never know who's reading it.
[00:56:30.900 --> 00:56:31.700]   I do love that mini.
[00:56:31.700 --> 00:56:32.860]   Kevin Toffle, sorry.
[00:56:32.860 --> 00:56:33.700]   OK, Kevin Toffle.
[00:56:33.700 --> 00:56:34.380]   Really?
[00:56:34.380 --> 00:56:36.780]   So next time I talk to Kevin, I'm going to thank him.
[00:56:36.780 --> 00:56:39.060]   Kevin Toffle made Apple make a mini?
[00:56:39.060 --> 00:56:40.140]   I believe it was Kevin, yeah.
[00:56:40.140 --> 00:56:40.740]   Wow.
[00:56:40.740 --> 00:56:43.020]   Because Eddie got his article, then Eddie went and bought
[00:56:43.020 --> 00:56:44.540]   the Bush tab, whatever--
[00:56:44.540 --> 00:56:45.940]   The Pixel 7 probably.
[00:56:45.940 --> 00:56:49.380]   The one right before that, the very first Samsung--
[00:56:49.380 --> 00:56:50.100]   Oh, the Samsung.
[00:56:50.100 --> 00:56:52.380]   --six inch tablet that came out, sorry, not six inch, eight
[00:56:52.380 --> 00:56:54.220]   inch, but came out right before the Pixel did.
[00:56:54.220 --> 00:56:55.980]   And then Eddie carried around and goes, no, no, we've
[00:56:55.980 --> 00:56:56.500]   got to make this.
[00:56:56.500 --> 00:56:58.420]   And Steve's like, fine, but if you're wrong, it's like
[00:56:58.420 --> 00:56:59.620]   same thing with iTunes on Windows.
[00:56:59.620 --> 00:57:00.620]   Don't you, man.
[00:57:00.620 --> 00:57:01.140]   It's your fault.
[00:57:01.140 --> 00:57:03.380]   It's all on you, man.
[00:57:03.380 --> 00:57:04.380]   So that's disappointing.
[00:57:04.380 --> 00:57:05.700]   Why do we think that the--
[00:57:05.700 --> 00:57:07.780]   First of all, do we think Mark's right and why do we think
[00:57:07.780 --> 00:57:08.940]   he's right if he is right?
[00:57:08.940 --> 00:57:10.180]   MacBook Pros were never coming.
[00:57:10.180 --> 00:57:11.300]   I think people would--
[00:57:11.300 --> 00:57:13.220]   Sometimes people get angry if something new comes out, which
[00:57:13.220 --> 00:57:15.340]   is the weirdest thing, but they just bought it and they
[00:57:15.340 --> 00:57:16.580]   don't want a new version for a while.
[00:57:16.580 --> 00:57:20.460]   So it's not going to be a yearly refresh on the M1s
[00:57:20.460 --> 00:57:21.460]   and the M2s.
[00:57:21.460 --> 00:57:23.660]   I think 18 months, I think, is going to be the case.
[00:57:23.660 --> 00:57:26.020]   But the air, I think, is disappointing because I think
[00:57:26.020 --> 00:57:26.980]   people waited a lot.
[00:57:26.980 --> 00:57:29.700]   We wanted those color airs.
[00:57:29.700 --> 00:57:30.780]   Yeah, we're just--
[00:57:30.780 --> 00:57:33.140]   Intel's going to make fun of Apple at a certain point for
[00:57:33.140 --> 00:57:35.020]   not getting their chips out fast enough.
[00:57:35.020 --> 00:57:36.020]   Yeah.
[00:57:36.020 --> 00:57:38.900]   Also, I'm not necessarily an iPad Air--
[00:57:38.900 --> 00:57:43.260]   excuse me-- a MacBook Air consumer, but I'm excited by the
[00:57:43.260 --> 00:57:46.580]   idea of what they could do with a case design design from the
[00:57:46.580 --> 00:57:49.260]   ground up around Apple Silicon.
[00:57:49.260 --> 00:57:55.340]   With its power features, with its heat features, it could
[00:57:55.340 --> 00:57:57.060]   really be--
[00:57:57.060 --> 00:58:00.820]   they could sell me something that, with a keyboard included,
[00:58:00.820 --> 00:58:04.740]   but there's like this iPad Pro with the Magic Keyboard, they
[00:58:04.740 --> 00:58:07.580]   could make something as absolutely cool, slim and sexy as
[00:58:07.580 --> 00:58:10.940]   this without making it into a doorstop shape.
[00:58:10.940 --> 00:58:12.980]   Yeah.
[00:58:12.980 --> 00:58:14.500]   Also, that can get one in purple.
[00:58:14.500 --> 00:58:15.740]   That would be nice.
[00:58:15.740 --> 00:58:16.540]   That's what I want.
[00:58:16.540 --> 00:58:17.540]   That's the color.
[00:58:17.540 --> 00:58:20.420]   Especially now that I know an M1 is an M1 is an M1.
[00:58:20.420 --> 00:58:23.660]   I'm not going to discriminate against a MacBook Air anymore.
[00:58:23.660 --> 00:58:27.180]   I want an octagon shape.
[00:58:27.180 --> 00:58:28.980]   You're not going to-- you could say it all you want.
[00:58:28.980 --> 00:58:30.780]   I think the UFC is what I want.
[00:58:30.780 --> 00:58:31.820]   That's what I want.
[00:58:31.820 --> 00:58:32.820]   Exactly.
[00:58:32.820 --> 00:58:37.420]   You could put your MMA like, action figures on it and have
[00:58:37.420 --> 00:58:38.420]   them fight out.
[00:58:38.420 --> 00:58:39.420]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:58:39.420 --> 00:58:42.820]   It has a little retracting net.
[00:58:42.820 --> 00:58:43.820]   It's the octagon.
[00:58:43.820 --> 00:58:44.820]   Yay, I get it.
[00:58:44.820 --> 00:58:45.820]   I get it.
[00:58:45.820 --> 00:58:46.820]   I get it.
[00:58:46.820 --> 00:58:47.820]   The honor you call.
[00:58:47.820 --> 00:58:48.820]   I get it.
[00:58:48.820 --> 00:58:51.100]   No rest score.
[00:58:51.100 --> 00:58:52.140]   How about the Mac Pro?
[00:58:52.140 --> 00:58:54.620]   June end of the year?
[00:58:54.620 --> 00:58:55.620]   June tees.
[00:58:55.620 --> 00:58:56.620]   June tees.
[00:58:56.620 --> 00:58:57.620]   Yeah, I think you're right.
[00:58:57.620 --> 00:58:58.620]   June tees.
[00:58:58.620 --> 00:58:59.620]   I help for it.
[00:58:59.620 --> 00:59:00.620]   June tees.
[00:59:00.620 --> 00:59:01.620]   They tease this March 8.
[00:59:01.620 --> 00:59:02.620]   They said there's one more.
[00:59:02.620 --> 00:59:05.780]   That sounded-- I've never heard Apple do that.
[00:59:05.780 --> 00:59:06.780]   Except for the Mac Pro.
[00:59:06.780 --> 00:59:08.340]   They keep on-- they'll tell us that.
[00:59:08.340 --> 00:59:10.900]   But after the bocal with the charger, I thought they would
[00:59:10.900 --> 00:59:12.100]   learn to never--
[00:59:12.100 --> 00:59:13.100]   I think it was the Mac Studio.
[00:59:13.100 --> 00:59:14.100]   I think it was the Mac Studio.
[00:59:14.100 --> 00:59:15.100]   This was the trash can again.
[00:59:15.100 --> 00:59:16.100]   And they didn't want people to panic.
[00:59:16.100 --> 00:59:17.100]   This was the only high end.
[00:59:17.100 --> 00:59:18.100]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:59:18.100 --> 00:59:19.100]   Yeah.
[00:59:19.100 --> 00:59:20.100]   Right.
[00:59:20.100 --> 00:59:21.100]   Right.
[00:59:21.100 --> 00:59:22.100]   For a lot of people, the studio is exactly what-- I mean, I'm
[00:59:22.100 --> 00:59:23.100]   very happy.
[00:59:23.100 --> 00:59:26.460]   I'm not going to be putting any GPU cards into my Mac anytime soon.
[00:59:26.460 --> 00:59:28.700]   So I don't need the expandability.
[00:59:28.700 --> 00:59:29.700]   Oh, Ray cards?
[00:59:29.700 --> 00:59:30.700]   No, Ray cards.
[00:59:30.700 --> 00:59:31.700]   I don't need the expandability.
[00:59:31.700 --> 00:59:32.700]   I'm a fiber.
[00:59:32.700 --> 00:59:35.340]   So the studio is exactly what I want.
[00:59:35.340 --> 00:59:38.980]   Once you get over the thickness of it, and I spell that with two
[00:59:38.980 --> 00:59:43.380]   Cs, you go, that's a nice looking little--
[00:59:43.380 --> 00:59:45.740]   You talk about how heavy the copper heat sink is.
[00:59:45.740 --> 00:59:46.740]   It's so heavy.
[00:59:46.740 --> 00:59:47.740]   It's like two pounds heavier.
[00:59:47.740 --> 00:59:48.740]   Oh, my God.
[00:59:48.740 --> 00:59:49.740]   It made--
[00:59:49.740 --> 00:59:50.740]   I have them here.
[00:59:50.740 --> 00:59:51.740]   Micah and I when we unbox it.
[00:59:51.740 --> 00:59:53.540]   So I don't have some side by side.
[00:59:53.540 --> 00:59:55.980]   When you're side by side, you can really tell the difference.
[00:59:55.980 --> 00:59:56.980]   Yeah.
[00:59:56.980 --> 00:59:57.980]   And I stack them.
[00:59:57.980 --> 00:59:58.980]   Yeah.
[00:59:58.980 --> 00:59:59.980]   Yeah.
[00:59:59.980 --> 01:00:03.540]   And now, I want hands going.
[01:00:03.540 --> 01:00:07.260]   Well, as I said, I get my Macs Friday, and Lisa's got the
[01:00:07.260 --> 01:00:09.300]   Ultra, so I will--
[01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:10.300]   Yeah.
[01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:13.540]   Oh, Doctor said I should sneak in in the middle of the night
[01:00:13.540 --> 01:00:15.620]   and swap them.
[01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:16.780]   Like a baby swap.
[01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:18.140]   Alex Lindsay uses kettlebells.
[01:00:18.140 --> 01:00:19.460]   It's like, get your work out.
[01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:22.140]   Honestly, if I swapped the--
[01:00:22.140 --> 01:00:25.100]   it took her Ultra and gave her my Macs, she would not know the
[01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:27.260]   difference at all.
[01:00:27.260 --> 01:00:28.740]   But now you told her.
[01:00:28.740 --> 01:00:30.100]   She's going to put a sticker on it.
[01:00:30.100 --> 01:00:31.460]   Now, yeah, now she's putting a sticker on it.
[01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:32.460]   Stick her on it.
[01:00:32.460 --> 01:00:33.460]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:00:33.460 --> 01:00:35.660]   But honestly, I don't think I would notice either.
[01:00:35.660 --> 01:00:39.660]   And so, why go to all that trouble if even I'm not going to
[01:00:39.660 --> 01:00:40.180]   notice?
[01:00:40.180 --> 01:00:41.660]   I'm going to be very happy with the Macs, I think.
[01:00:41.660 --> 01:00:44.580]   Potentially break things into the ultimate rule of our
[01:00:44.580 --> 01:00:45.220]   relationships.
[01:00:45.220 --> 01:00:46.580]   Exactly.
[01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:47.660]   No.
[01:00:47.660 --> 01:00:48.660]   It's like, you know what?
[01:00:48.660 --> 01:00:50.500]   A thing where a bunch of YouTubers bought Mac Pros when
[01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:51.860]   the new Mac Pro came out in 2019.
[01:00:51.860 --> 01:00:54.660]   Nobody uses 1.5 terabytes of RAM.
[01:00:54.660 --> 01:00:57.260]   Nobody needed those things.
[01:00:57.260 --> 01:00:58.980]   But it was the flex at the time, Leo.
[01:00:58.980 --> 01:00:59.700]   This is your flex.
[01:00:59.700 --> 01:01:02.700]   There's a lot of over buying when it comes to Apple stuff
[01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:04.300]   always.
[01:01:04.300 --> 01:01:05.740]   We have no lives, Leo.
[01:01:05.740 --> 01:01:07.180]   We have no lives other than this.
[01:01:07.180 --> 01:01:08.700]   Some people go on vacation.
[01:01:08.700 --> 01:01:10.260]   Some people buy fancy cars.
[01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:12.020]   Some people like, this is all we have.
[01:01:12.020 --> 01:01:16.260]   Well, I actually go through this thought experiment.
[01:01:16.260 --> 01:01:17.540]   Because right now, it's justified.
[01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:21.060]   We have to test them and try them and talk about them.
[01:01:21.060 --> 01:01:24.140]   But when I don't have to, someday in the future, the dim,
[01:01:24.140 --> 01:01:26.300]   dark, distant future, when I'm not actually doing--
[01:01:26.300 --> 01:01:28.300]   When you do a dowryple.
[01:01:28.300 --> 01:01:30.580]   Yeah, when I do a dowryple, that's good.
[01:01:30.580 --> 01:01:31.340]   I like it.
[01:01:31.340 --> 01:01:34.340]   So when I do the dowryple, what would I buy?
[01:01:34.340 --> 01:01:35.140]   What will I buy?
[01:01:35.140 --> 01:01:36.820]   How often will I buy?
[01:01:36.820 --> 01:01:37.780]   I certainly won't have had--
[01:01:37.780 --> 01:01:39.060]   I have four phones.
[01:01:39.060 --> 01:01:40.060]   Just get an iPad.
[01:01:40.060 --> 01:01:42.100]   Well, you have more electric cars.
[01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:43.060]   Yeah.
[01:01:43.060 --> 01:01:44.900]   No, that's right.
[01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:47.060]   It's a different world.
[01:01:47.060 --> 01:01:49.340]   Yeah, I mean, but it is part of Apple culture.
[01:01:49.340 --> 01:01:52.660]   Because we've grown up knowing that this is exactly--
[01:01:52.660 --> 01:01:55.060]   when I say grown up, I mean, from the first Apple
[01:01:55.060 --> 01:01:57.500]   purchase to the rest of our lives.
[01:01:57.500 --> 01:02:01.420]   We've grown up knowing that we will be shown a simple--
[01:02:01.420 --> 01:02:04.940]   like a fancy restaurant, we'll be shown a simple menu of the five
[01:02:04.940 --> 01:02:06.100]   things we can choose from.
[01:02:06.100 --> 01:02:07.220]   And we will pick one of them.
[01:02:07.220 --> 01:02:10.020]   And we are likely to say, whatever it is, I think I need.
[01:02:10.020 --> 01:02:10.940]   I want to go one better.
[01:02:10.940 --> 01:02:12.740]   Because who knows what will happen in the future?
[01:02:12.740 --> 01:02:14.100]   I want to get five years out of this.
[01:02:14.100 --> 01:02:17.260]   Whereas if we were Windows people, God forbid, one of the nice
[01:02:17.260 --> 01:02:20.300]   things is that we could say, no, here are 100 you can choose
[01:02:20.300 --> 01:02:20.500]   from.
[01:02:20.500 --> 01:02:22.220]   And if you don't see one thing that's
[01:02:22.220 --> 01:02:24.980]   perfect for you, go ahead and build it to your own specs.
[01:02:24.980 --> 01:02:27.140]   Like, because all the infrastructure is there.
[01:02:27.140 --> 01:02:28.540]   So yeah, there is a lot of that.
[01:02:28.540 --> 01:02:33.180]   Like, again, just as I said earlier, if I had already
[01:02:33.180 --> 01:02:37.580]   put aside $2,000 for a new desktop Mac, I am going to be
[01:02:37.580 --> 01:02:39.300]   spending this, but I don't necessarily have that
[01:02:39.300 --> 01:02:40.380]   set aside right now.
[01:02:40.380 --> 01:02:41.820]   I very might--
[01:02:41.820 --> 01:02:45.300]   I very well might have bought a Mac Studio the day that it
[01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:46.140]   was announced.
[01:02:46.140 --> 01:02:50.020]   Whereas after things cooled off, I'm like, you know what?
[01:02:50.020 --> 01:02:53.700]   I wasn't going to buy this until the end of the year anyway.
[01:02:53.700 --> 01:02:54.940]   I'm going to wait to see what the--
[01:02:54.940 --> 01:02:56.300]   It's good to have a cool off.
[01:02:56.300 --> 01:02:58.380]   It always could have a cool off period with that.
[01:02:58.380 --> 01:02:59.940]   That's the order period, Leo.
[01:02:59.940 --> 01:03:01.460]   It goes to five months real fast.
[01:03:01.460 --> 01:03:02.460]   So you can cool off early.
[01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:05.900]   By the way, that's a really good thing that because you can
[01:03:05.900 --> 01:03:08.100]   cancel with no penalty if they haven't shipped it yet.
[01:03:08.100 --> 01:03:09.460]   So for instance, I bought this--
[01:03:09.460 --> 01:03:10.900]   Oh, it is a process that Apple is shipping.
[01:03:10.900 --> 01:03:11.780]   Yeah, the R shipping.
[01:03:11.780 --> 01:03:13.300]   Like, you still can't get an Nvidia card or you still can't
[01:03:13.300 --> 01:03:14.460]   get like a Pia's try.
[01:03:14.460 --> 01:03:16.260]   They are shipping.
[01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:19.220]   But I can't think of this thing as super funny.
[01:03:19.220 --> 01:03:21.420]   If you ever see people who leave Apple, like, if they've been
[01:03:21.420 --> 01:03:25.620]   at Apple for 10, 20, 50, like 30 years and they leave Apple,
[01:03:25.620 --> 01:03:27.540]   all of a sudden, they don't know how to buy Apple gear
[01:03:27.540 --> 01:03:27.900]   anymore.
[01:03:27.900 --> 01:03:29.260]   You don't want to buy their own iPhone.
[01:03:29.260 --> 01:03:30.780]   You don't know how to buy their own computer.
[01:03:30.780 --> 01:03:32.620]   But also, they won't bait it.
[01:03:32.620 --> 01:03:35.020]   They were living on Purple Restore for years.
[01:03:35.020 --> 01:03:36.340]   They won't even put the beta on.
[01:03:36.340 --> 01:03:39.020]   They won't even put the current release version on.
[01:03:39.020 --> 01:03:40.820]   And then they won't upgrade either.
[01:03:40.820 --> 01:03:42.940]   And they'll upgrade when the computer literally falls
[01:03:42.940 --> 01:03:44.020]   into dust in front of them.
[01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:44.780]   And it's the most--
[01:03:44.780 --> 01:03:48.860]   It's so sad to see Steve Wozniak waiting in line at the Apple
[01:03:48.860 --> 01:03:50.100]   store to get his iPhone.
[01:03:50.100 --> 01:03:51.700]   It's just a sad, sad--
[01:03:51.700 --> 01:03:52.620]   But I know.
[01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:53.620]   It's a lot of fun.
[01:03:53.620 --> 01:03:54.180]   I'm teasing.
[01:03:54.180 --> 01:03:55.060]   It's a proud thing.
[01:03:55.060 --> 01:03:56.620]   It's a proud thing.
[01:03:56.620 --> 01:03:58.620]   You know what I would wait in line to get?
[01:03:58.620 --> 01:04:00.060]   My new ultimate ears.
[01:04:00.060 --> 01:04:01.580]   So let me talk about this sponsor.
[01:04:01.580 --> 01:04:04.900]   We'll come back and talk some more about all this Apple stuff.
[01:04:04.900 --> 01:04:08.380]   But you know that I wear any monitors that are molded.
[01:04:08.380 --> 01:04:09.300]   These are custom molded.
[01:04:09.300 --> 01:04:10.780]   You go to an audiologist.
[01:04:10.780 --> 01:04:12.460]   They pour stuff in your ear.
[01:04:12.460 --> 01:04:15.620]   You have to sit with your jaw open for like three minutes.
[01:04:15.620 --> 01:04:18.580]   And then they pull it out with a string and it's--
[01:04:18.580 --> 01:04:20.180]   And it's expensive.
[01:04:20.180 --> 01:04:21.300]   It's complicated.
[01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:24.340]   And then you get earbuds that are molded to your ear
[01:04:24.340 --> 01:04:26.500]   and your ear alone.
[01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:28.660]   And for this reason-- because I'm so used to these,
[01:04:28.660 --> 01:04:32.260]   I never liked earbuds because they never fit quite right.
[01:04:32.260 --> 01:04:34.940]   Well, for years, I've had ultimate ears molded earbuds.
[01:04:34.940 --> 01:04:36.100]   I am really pleased.
[01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:39.580]   Ultimate ears has come up with something that's in between.
[01:04:39.580 --> 01:04:42.420]   It's the ultimate ears fit.
[01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:44.660]   And while you don't have to go to an audiologist,
[01:04:44.660 --> 01:04:52.180]   these are actually fitted to my ears, which is really, really cool.
[01:04:52.180 --> 01:04:55.060]   They're not just round generic silicone tips.
[01:04:55.060 --> 01:04:57.180]   They actually are fitted to my ear canal.
[01:04:57.180 --> 01:05:01.180]   So not only do they fit perfectly, but they seal.
[01:05:01.180 --> 01:05:03.500]   So you get great bass.
[01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:05.020]   They sound wonderful.
[01:05:05.020 --> 01:05:06.660]   The other-- here, we're actually going
[01:05:06.660 --> 01:05:09.700]   to show you the process because I got the ultimate ears
[01:05:09.700 --> 01:05:10.700]   some time ago.
[01:05:10.700 --> 01:05:14.620]   And I wanted to record the fitting process.
[01:05:14.620 --> 01:05:17.580]   It's something they call Light Form Technology.
[01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:20.780]   And what you do is you're going to see in a minute.
[01:05:20.780 --> 01:05:22.540]   Notice that was sealed.
[01:05:22.540 --> 01:05:25.860]   And you have a minute or two, but you
[01:05:25.860 --> 01:05:28.540]   want to put that in your ear right away.
[01:05:28.540 --> 01:05:32.780]   First you get them turned on in the little box there.
[01:05:32.780 --> 01:05:35.100]   Use the app, which is a great little app that walks you
[01:05:35.100 --> 01:05:36.860]   through the Light Form process.
[01:05:36.860 --> 01:05:38.900]   You put them in your ear.
[01:05:38.900 --> 01:05:41.700]   And the Light Form Technology-- see,
[01:05:41.700 --> 01:05:43.300]   it's what it's doing right now.
[01:05:43.300 --> 01:05:46.060]   Somehow, heats it up a little bit, not hot.
[01:05:46.060 --> 01:05:49.380]   You feel like getting warm, and it molds to your ear.
[01:05:49.380 --> 01:05:54.500]   60 seconds later, you have a perfect fit.
[01:05:54.500 --> 01:05:55.580]   It isolates you.
[01:05:55.580 --> 01:05:56.860]   The bass is better.
[01:05:56.860 --> 01:05:59.060]   It's much, much more comfortable.
[01:05:59.060 --> 01:06:01.500]   There's another reason no one else can borrow your earbuds
[01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:02.860]   because they don't fit their ears.
[01:06:02.860 --> 01:06:05.380]   They only fit my ears.
[01:06:05.380 --> 01:06:08.260]   I just am a big, big fan of these.
[01:06:08.260 --> 01:06:10.740]   The sound quality is superb.
[01:06:10.740 --> 01:06:13.140]   You get eight hours of continuous playback
[01:06:13.140 --> 01:06:15.780]   on a single charge, 20 hours with this carrying case,
[01:06:15.780 --> 01:06:16.580]   which is beautiful.
[01:06:16.580 --> 01:06:18.100]   I got the white one because it just
[01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:19.620]   looks like a beautiful river stone.
[01:06:19.620 --> 01:06:22.140]   It's soft and round.
[01:06:22.140 --> 01:06:24.860]   It's great for listening to podcasts,
[01:06:24.860 --> 01:06:27.820]   but it's the best Bluetooth headphones I've ever
[01:06:27.820 --> 01:06:30.540]   used for listening to music as well.
[01:06:30.540 --> 01:06:31.740]   And it's not surprising.
[01:06:31.740 --> 01:06:35.420]   Ultimate ears-- I mean, I've been using ultimate ears for years.
[01:06:35.420 --> 01:06:40.380]   They perfected, invented, in fact, this technology.
[01:06:40.380 --> 01:06:43.020]   Pro musicians, high-fi enthusiasts,
[01:06:43.020 --> 01:06:45.340]   have been using ultimate ears for 25 years.
[01:06:45.340 --> 01:06:48.340]   When Bono pulls out his earpiece,
[01:06:48.340 --> 01:06:49.940]   those are molded to his ears.
[01:06:49.940 --> 01:06:50.660]   Chances are good.
[01:06:50.660 --> 01:06:51.620]   Those are ultimate ears.
[01:06:51.620 --> 01:06:54.100]   They started it all way back when.
[01:06:54.100 --> 01:06:55.500]   Full, warm sound.
[01:06:55.500 --> 01:06:57.820]   It's got a great punchy low end.
[01:06:57.820 --> 01:07:01.900]   Of course, there's customized EQ, which I went through,
[01:07:01.900 --> 01:07:03.900]   and you can customize it to your hearing,
[01:07:03.900 --> 01:07:07.500]   because I'm an old man, and so I wanted to make it a little
[01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:10.540]   bump at the high end, and it sounds fantastic.
[01:07:10.540 --> 01:07:14.180]   Oh, yeah, that's a microphone, by the way, which is really cool.
[01:07:14.180 --> 01:07:16.740]   So you can pause and play music.
[01:07:16.740 --> 01:07:18.020]   You can answer calls.
[01:07:18.020 --> 01:07:20.580]   Of course, it's got a touch-sensitive surface
[01:07:20.580 --> 01:07:22.980]   on both ears, so it's very easy to pair.
[01:07:22.980 --> 01:07:24.020]   It's very easy to answer calls.
[01:07:24.020 --> 01:07:25.100]   Turn the volume up.
[01:07:25.100 --> 01:07:26.420]   Turn the volume down.
[01:07:26.420 --> 01:07:30.980]   Ask your voice assistant of choice for something.
[01:07:30.980 --> 01:07:31.980]   I think you're going to love them.
[01:07:31.980 --> 01:07:34.340]   And if you try them and you don't,
[01:07:34.340 --> 01:07:36.380]   there's a 30-day money back guarantee,
[01:07:36.380 --> 01:07:38.300]   even though they're molded to your ear,
[01:07:38.300 --> 01:07:40.180]   which I think is pretty cool.
[01:07:40.180 --> 01:07:43.900]   Free shipping, free returns, one-year warranty.
[01:07:43.900 --> 01:07:47.060]   If you've been looking for earbuds that don't fall out,
[01:07:47.060 --> 01:07:51.340]   that sound great, that fit as if they were custom molded,
[01:07:51.340 --> 01:07:53.780]   you want ultimate ears, because they are.
[01:07:53.780 --> 01:07:55.700]   They are fantastic.
[01:07:55.700 --> 01:07:59.380]   Go to ue.com/fits.
[01:07:59.380 --> 01:08:00.780]   Use promo code MACBreak.
[01:08:00.780 --> 01:08:05.940]   UltimateEars is ue.com/fits to get your pair of UE fits.
[01:08:05.940 --> 01:08:08.740]   And I think the greatest fit.
[01:08:08.740 --> 01:08:10.140]   Look at that.
[01:08:10.140 --> 01:08:11.420]   Promo code MACBreak.
[01:08:11.420 --> 01:08:12.540]   Ultimate Ears.
[01:08:12.540 --> 01:08:15.140]   These are really, I mean, I am absolutely serious.
[01:08:15.140 --> 01:08:16.860]   These are really fantastic.
[01:08:16.860 --> 01:08:21.860]   I keep them in my European carry-out,
[01:08:21.860 --> 01:08:23.940]   so that I always have them with me.
[01:08:23.940 --> 01:08:25.620]   Of course, it works great with the iPhone.
[01:08:25.620 --> 01:08:26.660]   And every other phone I have.
[01:08:26.660 --> 01:08:28.580]   ue.com/fits.
[01:08:28.580 --> 01:08:30.100]   Thank you, Ultimate Ears.
[01:08:30.100 --> 01:08:32.900]   They sent me these so I could try the fitting,
[01:08:32.900 --> 01:08:34.300]   because I said, look, I gotta try this
[01:08:34.300 --> 01:08:35.260]   before I can recommend it,
[01:08:35.260 --> 01:08:38.140]   because I'm a little spoiled, you know, with these.
[01:08:38.140 --> 01:08:39.220]   These are great.
[01:08:39.220 --> 01:08:43.020]   ue.com/fits.
[01:08:43.020 --> 01:08:45.300]   Fits.
[01:08:45.300 --> 01:08:46.140]   All right.
[01:08:46.140 --> 01:08:48.620]   Mac Paul, let's talk about Mac Paul.
[01:08:48.620 --> 01:08:49.980]   We talked about him on Sunday.
[01:08:49.980 --> 01:08:53.060]   One of many great companies that are in Ukraine.
[01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:57.940]   Skylem does Luminar, love these guys.
[01:08:57.940 --> 01:09:01.460]   You know, they are in a miserable situation.
[01:09:01.460 --> 01:09:03.540]   I think it's interesting.
[01:09:03.540 --> 01:09:05.900]   Mac Paul does Clean My Mac X, right?
[01:09:05.900 --> 01:09:08.700]   And they do some really nice little utilities
[01:09:08.700 --> 01:09:12.460]   for the Mac set app we've recommended them before.
[01:09:12.460 --> 01:09:15.340]   They say, despite the invasion of our country by Russia,
[01:09:15.340 --> 01:09:16.580]   we are going to continue to work.
[01:09:16.580 --> 01:09:20.660]   We're in Kiev, Kiev, Kiev, Kiev.
[01:09:20.660 --> 01:09:22.580]   So.
[01:09:22.580 --> 01:09:23.540]   No, well.
[01:09:23.540 --> 01:09:24.380]   Thank you for trying.
[01:09:24.380 --> 01:09:26.700]   No, no, I want, so this we talked about.
[01:09:26.700 --> 01:09:27.780]   Exactly, don't.
[01:09:27.780 --> 01:09:32.300]   We watched a Ukrainian woman say, no, it's kuv.
[01:09:33.300 --> 01:09:34.300]   (laughs)
[01:09:34.300 --> 01:09:35.900]   But I'll say kuv, because that's,
[01:09:35.900 --> 01:09:38.420]   I think then you'll know what I'm talking about.
[01:09:38.420 --> 01:09:40.340]   So what they've done, which is, I think, hysterical,
[01:09:40.340 --> 01:09:43.860]   they made a Mac app to know whether your data
[01:09:43.860 --> 01:09:45.620]   is held on Russian servers.
[01:09:45.620 --> 01:09:49.100]   That's great.
[01:09:49.100 --> 01:09:49.940]   Isn't that amazing?
[01:09:49.940 --> 01:09:50.780]   It's called Spybuster.
[01:09:50.780 --> 01:09:51.620]   It's free.
[01:09:51.620 --> 01:09:52.460]   Mac Paul.
[01:09:52.460 --> 01:09:57.140]   You scan your Mac determines whether any apps are Russian
[01:09:57.140 --> 01:09:58.860]   or Belarusian.
[01:09:58.860 --> 01:10:01.460]   It can also tell whether any data is sent to servers
[01:10:01.460 --> 01:10:02.900]   in those regions.
[01:10:02.900 --> 01:10:07.180]   The data is significant because Mac Paul points out,
[01:10:07.180 --> 01:10:08.740]   this is from Apple Insider.
[01:10:08.740 --> 01:10:11.500]   Under Russian law, authorities can command local servers
[01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:14.780]   to hand over voice calls, data images, text messages
[01:10:14.780 --> 01:10:15.980]   from the last six months.
[01:10:15.980 --> 01:10:17.820]   If it's stored in a server in Russia,
[01:10:17.820 --> 01:10:19.620]   you might as well assume the Russian authorities
[01:10:19.620 --> 01:10:21.820]   can access it at any time.
[01:10:21.820 --> 01:10:23.900]   And that data has to be held on Russian servers
[01:10:23.900 --> 01:10:25.140]   for three years.
[01:10:26.580 --> 01:10:31.580]   So Spybuster is available from Mac Paul.
[01:10:31.580 --> 01:10:35.220]   We should all support them and all these other great
[01:10:35.220 --> 01:10:37.100]   developers in Ukraine.
[01:10:37.100 --> 01:10:39.140]   And you might not know, 'cause they might use an SDK
[01:10:39.140 --> 01:10:41.900]   or they might have used a open source software package
[01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:43.740]   or they might use a service that actually is built.
[01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:45.900]   Like it's hard to tell, so these things are invaluable.
[01:10:45.900 --> 01:10:46.900]   Yeah.
[01:10:46.900 --> 01:10:48.860]   It's very interesting, this kind of digital activism
[01:10:48.860 --> 01:10:51.180]   that's coming out specifically for this conflict.
[01:10:51.180 --> 01:10:52.500]   It's really, really great to see.
[01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:55.220]   It's reassuring to see the amount of power
[01:10:55.220 --> 01:10:57.500]   that is still retained by an individual
[01:10:57.500 --> 01:10:59.580]   who has some ability and has resources
[01:10:59.580 --> 01:11:01.100]   and wants to do the right thing.
[01:11:01.100 --> 01:11:04.260]   And Alex, I'm sorry, but your India photogrammetry
[01:11:04.260 --> 01:11:05.860]   is probably on a Russian server.
[01:11:05.860 --> 01:11:07.020]   Right now.
[01:11:07.020 --> 01:11:07.860]   Sorry.
[01:11:07.860 --> 01:11:11.460]   I didn't know, I didn't know, man.
[01:11:11.460 --> 01:11:13.980]   I have to admit, until you said that, I had forgotten.
[01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:16.260]   I just hadn't thought about Metashapot.
[01:11:16.260 --> 01:11:19.140]   There's a lot of great software written in--
[01:11:19.140 --> 01:11:20.100]   A lot of good coders.
[01:11:20.100 --> 01:11:23.500]   A lot of good coders in Russia, but also Ukraine.
[01:11:23.500 --> 01:11:24.900]   A lot of the former Soviet Union,
[01:11:24.900 --> 01:11:28.220]   they were very skilled coders and well-trained
[01:11:28.220 --> 01:11:30.580]   and they're making great software,
[01:11:30.580 --> 01:11:34.140]   including, by the way, AGIsoft, which is in St. Petersburg.
[01:11:34.140 --> 01:11:39.140]   And I have no reason to think AGIsoft is a puden puppet.
[01:11:39.140 --> 01:11:43.540]   So I'm torn, I don't know.
[01:11:43.540 --> 01:11:44.500]   I don't know.
[01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:45.860]   I don't know.
[01:11:45.860 --> 01:11:48.020]   But this is probably a good thing to get spy bus.
[01:11:48.020 --> 01:11:49.820]   You can know people and not love their current leadership.
[01:11:49.820 --> 01:11:50.580]   Absolutely.
[01:11:50.580 --> 01:11:53.340]   I don't blame the people at all for their--
[01:11:53.340 --> 01:11:58.340]   I mean, there is much at his mercy as anybody.
[01:11:58.340 --> 01:12:01.020]   And former governor Schwarzenegger is getting--
[01:12:01.020 --> 01:12:02.580]   Don't you love Arnold?
[01:12:02.580 --> 01:12:04.140]   Damn, I'm Arnold.
[01:12:04.140 --> 01:12:05.940]   Man.
[01:12:05.940 --> 01:12:06.980]   By the way, he is--
[01:12:06.980 --> 01:12:07.900]   I thought I won a retire.
[01:12:07.900 --> 01:12:09.620]   He is being-- yeah, I know, isn't it great?
[01:12:09.620 --> 01:12:10.980]   And he's got his-- he's got-- I don't know
[01:12:10.980 --> 01:12:13.380]   where that is, is that jacket with the California flag
[01:12:13.380 --> 01:12:15.140]   on it and the American flag on the other--
[01:12:15.140 --> 01:12:16.700]   I'm putting on the--
[01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:17.780]   Get me my jacket.
[01:12:17.780 --> 01:12:19.260]   I'm going to make a video.
[01:12:22.060 --> 01:12:25.900]   I mean, I-- it sounds like I'm trying to be funny here,
[01:12:25.900 --> 01:12:27.220]   but I'm being serious.
[01:12:27.220 --> 01:12:30.900]   He's in the running to be elected like the male Dolly Parton.
[01:12:30.900 --> 01:12:32.460]   And I agree.
[01:12:32.460 --> 01:12:35.740]   You don't hear from him a lot, but when he says something,
[01:12:35.740 --> 01:12:36.660]   it is beautiful.
[01:12:36.660 --> 01:12:37.500]   It is perfect.
[01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:40.500]   It makes-- it helps the situation.
[01:12:40.500 --> 01:12:44.260]   And just like when he made that video after the January 6,
[01:12:44.260 --> 01:12:48.500]   the 10th insurrection, this is just Frank Direct.
[01:12:48.500 --> 01:12:52.260]   It's all the points and just absolutely, again,
[01:12:52.260 --> 01:12:54.420]   makes you very, very happy to have--
[01:12:54.420 --> 01:12:57.780]   at least be genetically speaking the same species
[01:12:57.780 --> 01:12:58.700]   as this individual.
[01:12:58.700 --> 01:13:01.860]   I love it that he's taking his notoriety from such movies
[01:13:01.860 --> 01:13:04.220]   as total recall and determinator
[01:13:04.220 --> 01:13:06.100]   and turning it into political capital.
[01:13:06.100 --> 01:13:07.340]   It's hysterical.
[01:13:07.340 --> 01:13:09.860]   Well, again, it's like you make assumptions
[01:13:09.860 --> 01:13:12.100]   about people's celebrities too, where like, oh, well,
[01:13:12.100 --> 01:13:14.180]   cable, he's a muscle-bound guy and he decided
[01:13:14.180 --> 01:13:15.260]   to become an actor.
[01:13:15.260 --> 01:13:18.100]   Like, no, he actually, like, again, came to this country
[01:13:18.100 --> 01:13:19.340]   with basically nothing.
[01:13:19.340 --> 01:13:21.700]   He basically was motivated by what he wanted to do,
[01:13:21.700 --> 01:13:22.580]   what he wanted to accomplish.
[01:13:22.580 --> 01:13:24.540]   Started like a construction business
[01:13:24.540 --> 01:13:27.220]   that put him on his feet and made him wealthy,
[01:13:27.220 --> 01:13:29.620]   went from there to this, this, this, this.
[01:13:29.620 --> 01:13:30.900]   And you're like, OK.
[01:13:30.900 --> 01:13:34.820]   I guess the times when we're making fun of the accent about,
[01:13:34.820 --> 01:13:36.020]   oh, I'm stupid.
[01:13:36.020 --> 01:13:37.060]   All I do is lift face it.
[01:13:37.060 --> 01:13:39.100]   Oh, actually, he's about five times smarter
[01:13:39.100 --> 01:13:40.900]   and 10 times more capable than I've
[01:13:40.900 --> 01:13:42.820]   been in the best day of my life.
[01:13:42.820 --> 01:13:44.820]   Of course, as a result, as being
[01:13:44.820 --> 01:13:51.220]   reviled by state TV in Russia, on Sunday evening
[01:13:51.220 --> 01:13:54.700]   with Vladimir Vadim Gigan said, that face, that face,
[01:13:54.700 --> 01:13:56.500]   that Schwarzenegger face is the cover
[01:13:56.500 --> 01:14:00.100]   page of American imperialism and colonialism,
[01:14:00.100 --> 01:14:02.140]   not the caricature image of Uncle Sam,
[01:14:02.140 --> 01:14:07.460]   but these shorts in the Hollywood production.
[01:14:07.460 --> 01:14:08.060]   Really?
[01:14:08.060 --> 01:14:08.420]   Yeah.
[01:14:08.420 --> 01:14:09.620]   You know what "shwartz" means?
[01:14:09.620 --> 01:14:10.100]   Yeah.
[01:14:10.100 --> 01:14:11.260]   Yeah, isn't that interesting?
[01:14:11.260 --> 01:14:12.900]   Isn't that telling?
[01:14:12.900 --> 01:14:13.460]   Yeah.
[01:14:14.340 --> 01:14:15.860]   OK.
[01:14:15.860 --> 01:14:17.900]   OK.
[01:14:17.900 --> 01:14:19.180]   Yeah, good on you, Arnold.
[01:14:19.180 --> 01:14:24.940]   Arnold, here he is in his special jumpsuit.
[01:14:24.940 --> 01:14:27.580]   The gubernatorial we call him.
[01:14:27.580 --> 01:14:28.900]   That's a power office, too.
[01:14:28.900 --> 01:14:29.540]   Oh, man.
[01:14:29.540 --> 01:14:30.660]   Yeah.
[01:14:30.660 --> 01:14:32.580]   The last video, he had a samurai sword
[01:14:32.580 --> 01:14:33.260]   that he brought out.
[01:14:33.260 --> 01:14:34.420]   This was the COVID.
[01:14:34.420 --> 01:14:36.260]   No, there was the Conan sword.
[01:14:36.260 --> 01:14:36.820]   Like Conan.
[01:14:36.820 --> 01:14:37.500]   That's right.
[01:14:37.500 --> 01:14:37.860]   The hero sword.
[01:14:37.860 --> 01:14:38.980]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:14:38.980 --> 01:14:41.860]   The hero sword.
[01:14:41.860 --> 01:14:44.580]   Get yourself to Mars.
[01:14:44.580 --> 01:14:47.140]   Apple is fined for the ninth time.
[01:14:47.140 --> 01:14:48.620]   There's only one more week.
[01:14:48.620 --> 01:14:50.580]   And then this will all be over Apple
[01:14:50.580 --> 01:14:52.580]   by the Dutch regulators.
[01:14:52.580 --> 01:14:57.860]   It's five million euros every week.
[01:14:57.860 --> 01:14:59.620]   And I think the max is 10 weeks, right?
[01:14:59.620 --> 01:15:00.460]   So one more week--
[01:15:00.460 --> 01:15:01.940]   I'm pretty sure that Apple just looked at it.
[01:15:01.940 --> 01:15:02.940]   I was like, what the hell did they look at it?
[01:15:02.940 --> 01:15:03.460]   I know.
[01:15:03.460 --> 01:15:05.460]   The funny thing is that I think that Apple just saw it
[01:15:05.460 --> 01:15:06.860]   and said, well, that'll cost $50 million.
[01:15:06.860 --> 01:15:08.380]   And then they went back to what they were doing.
[01:15:08.380 --> 01:15:08.860]   Yeah.
[01:15:08.860 --> 01:15:10.700]   Like Tim Cook has a stock of singles.
[01:15:10.700 --> 01:15:12.820]   And he's just counting off singles every week.
[01:15:12.820 --> 01:15:14.300]   Make it rain, Tim.
[01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:15.500]   Make it rain.
[01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:18.620]   Yeah, exactly like that scene of the godfather
[01:15:18.620 --> 01:15:21.140]   where Sonny grabs a camera away from a reporter,
[01:15:21.140 --> 01:15:23.060]   smashes it to the ground, throws Mars.
[01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:23.540]   And he throws Mars.
[01:15:23.540 --> 01:15:23.980]   It's on up.
[01:15:23.980 --> 01:15:26.580]   And then just like, there's all three pills up.
[01:15:26.580 --> 01:15:28.020]   You don't want to be Apple?
[01:15:28.020 --> 01:15:30.740]   You don't want to be Sonny Corleone.
[01:15:30.740 --> 01:15:33.860]   Where do you want to be Michael Corleone?
[01:15:33.860 --> 01:15:36.340]   And you don't want to be either of those guys, really.
[01:15:36.340 --> 01:15:43.580]   Is it ironic that Apple itself has changed Apple music
[01:15:43.580 --> 01:15:46.500]   on Android so that they don't have to give 30% to Google?
[01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:46.980]   Yeah.
[01:15:46.980 --> 01:15:47.660]   Is there a little line?
[01:15:47.660 --> 01:15:48.380]   I agree with Google.
[01:15:48.380 --> 01:15:49.300]   That's not ironic.
[01:15:49.300 --> 01:15:51.500]   But putting the button there is a lot of money.
[01:15:51.500 --> 01:15:51.820]   Oh, yeah.
[01:15:51.820 --> 01:15:52.460]   They break their--
[01:15:52.460 --> 01:15:52.780]   It's OK.
[01:15:52.780 --> 01:15:53.780]   Yeah.
[01:15:53.780 --> 01:15:55.700]   You don't have to pay the money if you don't want to.
[01:15:55.700 --> 01:15:57.540]   But putting a button that you don't allow people
[01:15:57.540 --> 01:16:00.060]   to put on iOS apps on the Android app,
[01:16:00.060 --> 01:16:02.420]   because Google does allow it, that's a bridge too far.
[01:16:02.420 --> 01:16:03.420]   Yeah, sir.
[01:16:03.420 --> 01:16:06.380]   Apple TV app on Android TV and Google TV
[01:16:06.380 --> 01:16:09.580]   will not let users buy or rent movies,
[01:16:09.580 --> 01:16:13.420]   because Apple apparently had made a deal with Google
[01:16:13.420 --> 01:16:16.900]   that they wouldn't have to pay commissions on in app payments.
[01:16:16.900 --> 01:16:18.020]   That deal expired.
[01:16:18.020 --> 01:16:18.900]   They were negotiating.
[01:16:18.900 --> 01:16:21.180]   They didn't find a solution, so they removed it.
[01:16:21.180 --> 01:16:24.220]   But then they did the thing that Apple won't let you do.
[01:16:24.220 --> 01:16:25.420]   But Google does.
[01:16:25.420 --> 01:16:28.100]   There is a button that says, how to watch
[01:16:28.100 --> 01:16:30.180]   with a simple, clear explanation of how you can
[01:16:30.180 --> 01:16:34.300]   buy or rent content by going to a different device.
[01:16:34.300 --> 01:16:35.500]   Like, have some empathy, right?
[01:16:35.500 --> 01:16:36.460]   Like, it's hard.
[01:16:36.460 --> 01:16:38.740]   Like, app stores are aggregators of apps.
[01:16:38.740 --> 01:16:40.780]   And a lot of apps are aggregators of content,
[01:16:40.780 --> 01:16:43.900]   like whether it's comic books or books or videos or TV or music.
[01:16:43.900 --> 01:16:46.380]   And you can't do a 70, 30, 30 split.
[01:16:46.380 --> 01:16:48.060]   That's just not how math works.
[01:16:48.060 --> 01:16:50.540]   So like, it's very little room for double aggregators.
[01:16:50.540 --> 01:16:52.060]   And Apple is like feeling this pain,
[01:16:52.060 --> 01:16:53.300]   but they're just like, whatever.
[01:16:53.300 --> 01:16:54.300]   We can do it on Android.
[01:16:54.300 --> 01:16:54.820]   Whoops.
[01:16:54.820 --> 01:16:56.020]   Would it be OK with you?
[01:16:56.020 --> 01:16:56.620]   Would it be OK with Apple?
[01:16:56.620 --> 01:16:58.380]   If Apple allowed a button that said, here's
[01:16:58.380 --> 01:17:01.140]   how you can buy this stuff?
[01:17:01.140 --> 01:17:03.660]   You know, the main thing is, is that as we open that up,
[01:17:03.660 --> 01:17:06.180]   as an Android user, they do whatever they're going to do.
[01:17:06.180 --> 01:17:09.060]   As a Mac user, I think the Apple user, I guess,
[01:17:09.060 --> 01:17:10.740]   what I would say is that-- and I don't think Apple should
[01:17:10.740 --> 01:17:13.300]   have put that button on because of what their rules are.
[01:17:13.300 --> 01:17:16.260]   So I agree with Renee that that was dumb.
[01:17:16.260 --> 01:17:18.060]   You know?
[01:17:18.060 --> 01:17:21.060]   But so I-- and the problem is it undermines their entire case
[01:17:21.060 --> 01:17:21.780]   for them to do that.
[01:17:21.780 --> 01:17:23.980]   And there was just this unforced error.
[01:17:23.980 --> 01:17:25.380]   They shouldn't do that.
[01:17:25.380 --> 01:17:28.660]   They should follow their own rules inside of the Android
[01:17:28.660 --> 01:17:31.420]   platform for the eight people that are using Apple TV
[01:17:31.420 --> 01:17:32.860]   on the Android platform.
[01:17:32.860 --> 01:17:37.660]   And so the thing is that-- but I think that the problem is,
[01:17:37.660 --> 01:17:42.260]   it's not that by opening that little gap,
[01:17:42.260 --> 01:17:45.780]   what happens is that at this point, Netflix makes you go,
[01:17:45.780 --> 01:17:47.340]   like I'm about to get rid of Netflix
[01:17:47.340 --> 01:17:49.020]   because I'm going to get rid of everything that requires
[01:17:49.020 --> 01:17:52.140]   some other login other than my Apple remote
[01:17:52.140 --> 01:17:53.780]   because I just had it.
[01:17:53.780 --> 01:17:56.780]   And so the thing-- and in general, the Apple TV
[01:17:56.780 --> 01:18:00.020]   is kind of a disaster when it comes to apps
[01:18:00.020 --> 01:18:03.020]   because they let all these people check for cable.
[01:18:03.020 --> 01:18:06.140]   And then you have to-- I still haven't gotten-- I pay.
[01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:08.340]   I don't know how much for Masterclass.
[01:18:08.340 --> 01:18:11.780]   I still watch it by sharing my phone to my Apple TV
[01:18:11.780 --> 01:18:14.860]   because I can't get Masterclass to work on my Apple TV.
[01:18:14.860 --> 01:18:17.340]   And so the thing is because it requires some login
[01:18:17.340 --> 01:18:19.620]   that I go to the website and I do this thing,
[01:18:19.620 --> 01:18:22.460]   that's what will happen to everything
[01:18:22.460 --> 01:18:23.740]   if they start opening that up.
[01:18:23.740 --> 01:18:24.580]   And that's the thing.
[01:18:24.580 --> 01:18:26.380]   It's from a user's experience.
[01:18:26.380 --> 01:18:29.580]   It's way better to say this is the way it works.
[01:18:29.580 --> 01:18:31.140]   I think I have a better solution, too.
[01:18:31.140 --> 01:18:32.700]   Instead of just putting that button there,
[01:18:32.700 --> 01:18:36.300]   just don't charge RevShare on double aggregated content
[01:18:36.300 --> 01:18:38.380]   the way you don't charge it on physical goods.
[01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:40.980]   That, I realize it would cost everybody a little bit of money,
[01:18:40.980 --> 01:18:43.100]   not that much money compared to how much money you make
[01:18:43.100 --> 01:18:44.500]   from everything else.
[01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:47.460]   But that would mean you don't have to have the button.
[01:18:47.460 --> 01:18:49.660]   People could actually aggregate content and share it in a way.
[01:18:49.660 --> 01:18:52.220]   And it would just solve so many of these problems,
[01:18:52.220 --> 01:18:53.340]   which just seems so silly.
[01:18:53.340 --> 01:18:54.180]   Yeah.
[01:18:54.180 --> 01:18:57.100]   I just continue to have that annoyance with Apple.
[01:18:57.100 --> 01:19:00.340]   It's the one consistent thing that just annoys me about Apple
[01:19:00.340 --> 01:19:02.020]   and all the things I have to research about them
[01:19:02.020 --> 01:19:05.100]   and write about them that they want to present this face
[01:19:05.100 --> 01:19:07.820]   that we are a company, we're human-oriented, we care.
[01:19:07.820 --> 01:19:09.940]   We're not like the others, we care about you,
[01:19:09.940 --> 01:19:11.420]   we care about big issues.
[01:19:11.420 --> 01:19:14.620]   But again, not that I'm saying that they should be different
[01:19:14.620 --> 01:19:16.500]   from other trillion dollar companies,
[01:19:16.500 --> 01:19:19.300]   but it's always going to be a fact that at a certain scale
[01:19:19.300 --> 01:19:21.020]   any company is going to do,
[01:19:21.020 --> 01:19:23.900]   is not going to do things that interferes with the money.
[01:19:23.900 --> 01:19:26.740]   And they're not going to let the fact that,
[01:19:26.740 --> 01:19:30.580]   well, look, we've sent this message about why we are pressing
[01:19:30.580 --> 01:19:35.500]   these limitations upon the App Store developers
[01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:38.260]   that the App Store developers thinks are unfair and unsuitable,
[01:19:38.260 --> 01:19:39.900]   but we're not going to follow our own rules
[01:19:39.900 --> 01:19:43.060]   because we're special, because for us to be consistent
[01:19:43.060 --> 01:19:47.060]   in that would cost us money and we don't want this to cost us money.
[01:19:47.060 --> 01:19:49.580]   Well, especially in a market that is like a 1% market for them.
[01:19:49.580 --> 01:19:50.100]   I mean, who--
[01:19:50.100 --> 01:19:52.540]   I don't know if anybody on Android,
[01:19:52.540 --> 01:19:55.820]   it was such a-- that is literally a spiteful,
[01:19:55.820 --> 01:19:58.540]   like literally doing that a spiteful because it's not a market.
[01:19:58.540 --> 01:20:03.100]   Like the Android market is not a market for Apple movies,
[01:20:03.100 --> 01:20:04.100]   or whatever it's like.
[01:20:04.100 --> 01:20:08.580]   I mean, Apple cared enough to make a standalone app
[01:20:08.580 --> 01:20:12.100]   and put it on Roku and Google TV and other things.
[01:20:12.100 --> 01:20:13.900]   I think they must think there's a market for that.
[01:20:13.900 --> 01:20:17.100]   I think the camera is not as good as the Apple app.
[01:20:17.100 --> 01:20:18.740]   Some people have Android TV.
[01:20:18.740 --> 01:20:19.740]   Like-- Yeah.
[01:20:19.740 --> 01:20:20.740]   Yeah.
[01:20:20.740 --> 01:20:24.740]   So they cared enough about selling content from their own media store.
[01:20:24.740 --> 01:20:25.740]   That's what they cared about.
[01:20:25.740 --> 01:20:26.740]   Yeah.
[01:20:26.740 --> 01:20:27.740]   So there's a company--
[01:20:27.740 --> 01:20:28.740]   There's a company--
[01:20:28.740 --> 01:20:29.740]   I was saying the last thing.
[01:20:29.740 --> 01:20:30.740]   I would never get an app.
[01:20:30.740 --> 01:20:32.220]   I would never buy an Apple.
[01:20:32.220 --> 01:20:34.940]   I would never buy an app-- get an app just to watch the Apple content.
[01:20:34.940 --> 01:20:38.500]   That's the problem that they have right now is I think they want to get it out to more people.
[01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:41.300]   But the reason that I have it is because it comes with a bunch of other things.
[01:20:41.300 --> 01:20:44.780]   Like I don't-- like Apple TV Plus has not turned that corner yet.
[01:20:44.780 --> 01:20:46.860]   You don't like Ted Lasso?
[01:20:46.860 --> 01:20:47.340]   Lo?
[01:20:47.340 --> 01:20:47.540]   Oh.
[01:20:47.540 --> 01:20:48.060]   You don't like it.
[01:20:48.060 --> 01:20:49.060]   I just--
[01:20:49.060 --> 01:20:50.060]   Believe.
[01:20:50.060 --> 01:20:51.060]   Believe Alex.
[01:20:51.060 --> 01:20:52.060]   And I was like--
[01:20:52.060 --> 01:20:59.100]   Severance Servant, The Morning Show, The Academy Award-nominated Koda.
[01:20:59.100 --> 01:21:00.100]   You don't like that.
[01:21:00.100 --> 01:21:02.340]   What's wrong with you, Alex?
[01:21:02.340 --> 01:21:03.340]   Too much Brussels press.
[01:21:03.340 --> 01:21:05.500]   The space race is a lot of Brussels press.
[01:21:05.500 --> 01:21:08.860]   But you like Tiny House or whatever it is, Tiny Village.
[01:21:08.860 --> 01:21:09.860]   Tiny--
[01:21:09.860 --> 01:21:12.140]   Because the cinematography is unbelievable.
[01:21:12.140 --> 01:21:14.780]   As someone who shoots, like what they shot.
[01:21:14.780 --> 01:21:15.780]   They got you.
[01:21:15.780 --> 01:21:19.340]   I know how hard it is to do what they did and it was really hard.
[01:21:19.340 --> 01:21:21.180]   And it looks beautiful.
[01:21:21.180 --> 01:21:26.100]   And it's like what you-- I just wish all educational content looked like Tiny World
[01:21:26.100 --> 01:21:27.100]   or whatever.
[01:21:27.100 --> 01:21:28.100]   Yeah.
[01:21:28.100 --> 01:21:29.100]   Tiny World.
[01:21:29.100 --> 01:21:30.100]   I don't know.
[01:21:30.100 --> 01:21:31.100]   I don't know.
[01:21:31.100 --> 01:21:32.100]   I promise.
[01:21:32.100 --> 01:21:33.100]   Yeah.
[01:21:33.100 --> 01:21:37.660]   But I just wanted to be that-- I think it's Plimsole Productions that did that.
[01:21:37.660 --> 01:21:40.340]   They do all the-- a lot of the big National Geographic stuff as well.
[01:21:40.340 --> 01:21:42.500]   And I'm sure that Apple just-- and so they're well known for it.
[01:21:42.500 --> 01:21:46.140]   Apple just said, how about we give you all the money to do what you do?
[01:21:46.140 --> 01:21:47.140]   Yeah.
[01:21:47.140 --> 01:21:48.140]   They were like, sure.
[01:21:48.140 --> 01:21:49.140]   I got you.
[01:21:49.140 --> 01:21:50.140]   We'll take all the money.
[01:21:50.140 --> 01:21:51.140]   Yeah.
[01:21:51.140 --> 01:21:52.140]   But it takes-- it took a decade to make that.
[01:21:52.140 --> 01:21:55.780]   Like if you look at the second one, they're at night, which is the kind of the night version
[01:21:55.780 --> 01:21:56.780]   of that.
[01:21:56.780 --> 01:21:57.780]   The decade?
[01:21:57.780 --> 01:21:58.780]   They shot that for 10 years?
[01:21:58.780 --> 01:22:01.220]   That was a lot of stuff that they'd already had if they're banking.
[01:22:01.220 --> 01:22:05.620]   And so the thing is that you could tell because when they went to the next one, which is like,
[01:22:05.620 --> 01:22:07.460]   hey, let's build off of this.
[01:22:07.460 --> 01:22:08.460]   And that's so good.
[01:22:08.460 --> 01:22:09.460]   Look at that.
[01:22:09.460 --> 01:22:10.460]   They fell off really quickly.
[01:22:10.460 --> 01:22:11.460]   You know, it's interesting.
[01:22:11.460 --> 01:22:14.300]   Hard to produce that in mass quantities.
[01:22:14.300 --> 01:22:16.100]   There's a company called Alivecore.
[01:22:16.100 --> 01:22:19.180]   I was aware of it because Vic Gundotra left Google.
[01:22:19.180 --> 01:22:21.900]   He's a creator of Google+ to work there.
[01:22:21.900 --> 01:22:23.180]   They make a thing that I use.
[01:22:23.180 --> 01:22:31.940]   And it's great to detect atrial fibrillation, brachycardia, tachycardia.
[01:22:31.940 --> 01:22:34.060]   It's a little-- put your thumbs on it.
[01:22:34.060 --> 01:22:35.060]   And it's really cool.
[01:22:35.060 --> 01:22:36.340]   It records EKG.
[01:22:36.340 --> 01:22:40.340]   They want to put something similar in the Apple watch.
[01:22:40.340 --> 01:22:43.180]   Apple, they claim they're suing them.
[01:22:43.180 --> 01:22:49.820]   Apple changed the heart rate algorithm, says Alivecore, to make it effectively impossible
[01:22:49.820 --> 01:22:54.380]   for third parties to inform a user when to take an ECG.
[01:22:54.380 --> 01:23:01.540]   A judge has now ruled, federal judge in San Jose has now ruled that Apple must face this
[01:23:01.540 --> 01:23:07.380]   lawsuit that claims it illegal, monopolizes the US market for heart rate monitoring apps
[01:23:07.380 --> 01:23:10.060]   for its Apple watch.
[01:23:10.060 --> 01:23:16.020]   Alivecore makes a band, the Cardia Band wristband, which can record ECGs.
[01:23:16.020 --> 01:23:20.620]   The judge-- actually, the judge is in Oakland, I'm sorry, says that the wristband complements
[01:23:20.620 --> 01:23:24.100]   but does not compete in that market.
[01:23:24.100 --> 01:23:28.580]   And so they dismiss Alivecore's separate claim that Apple maintaining illegal monopoly over
[01:23:28.580 --> 01:23:31.980]   ECG capable smartwatches.
[01:23:31.980 --> 01:23:40.780]   But the lawsuit can go ahead.
[01:23:40.780 --> 01:23:42.980]   It's not even worth making Apple watch apps at this point.
[01:23:42.980 --> 01:23:46.220]   They should just make it an appliance.
[01:23:46.220 --> 01:23:47.220]   Yeah.
[01:23:47.220 --> 01:23:53.860]   I have to say I have a little soft spot for Alivecore because it's a really $99 device
[01:23:53.860 --> 01:23:54.860]   that is saving--
[01:23:54.860 --> 01:23:55.860]   They're great.
[01:23:55.860 --> 01:23:57.700]   But this just sounds like a make work project for Apple.
[01:23:57.700 --> 01:24:00.500]   They're going to have to make all the APIs and maintain all this.
[01:24:00.500 --> 01:24:03.660]   The market for Apple watches is nowhere nearly with the market for Apple.
[01:24:03.660 --> 01:24:04.660]   It's not the same.
[01:24:04.660 --> 01:24:09.740]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, true, true.
[01:24:09.740 --> 01:24:11.300]   Let's see.
[01:24:11.300 --> 01:24:15.940]   Do you have an iPhone running 15.4?
[01:24:15.940 --> 01:24:19.300]   Is your battery dying early?
[01:24:19.300 --> 01:24:23.420]   Apparently 5G is the problem.
[01:24:23.420 --> 01:24:25.420]   You can turn it off.
[01:24:25.420 --> 01:24:28.300]   This is according to Nicole Nguyen in the Wall Street Journal.
[01:24:28.300 --> 01:24:31.300]   When you turn the 5G off, you know what you're going to notice?
[01:24:31.300 --> 01:24:32.300]   Nothing.
[01:24:32.300 --> 01:24:33.300]   Nothing.
[01:24:33.300 --> 01:24:35.540]   Because LTE is nothing.
[01:24:35.540 --> 01:24:37.100]   It's like a good case for--
[01:24:37.100 --> 01:24:42.140]   Well, I will say this because I was able to find-- I have T-Mobile running on my iPhone
[01:24:42.140 --> 01:24:44.380]   12.
[01:24:44.380 --> 01:24:46.420]   And I was able to find a mid band.
[01:24:46.420 --> 01:24:48.180]   So there's three bands of 5G.
[01:24:48.180 --> 01:24:49.180]   There's low band, which is very--
[01:24:49.180 --> 01:24:50.180]   You found a C band?
[01:24:50.180 --> 01:24:51.460]   Yeah, I found a C band.
[01:24:51.460 --> 01:24:54.180]   So there's a very wide speed low band.
[01:24:54.180 --> 01:24:55.180]   T-Mobile does it.
[01:24:55.180 --> 01:24:56.740]   I think AT&T does it.
[01:24:56.740 --> 01:24:58.100]   It's exactly the same as LTE.
[01:24:58.100 --> 01:24:59.340]   It's just a different technology.
[01:24:59.340 --> 01:25:00.780]   So it's not any faster.
[01:25:00.780 --> 01:25:05.460]   There's the millimeter wave, which is Verizon's super fast.
[01:25:05.460 --> 01:25:07.660]   That's the one they always talk about gigabit speeds and stuff.
[01:25:07.660 --> 01:25:09.260]   But you can't find anywhere.
[01:25:09.260 --> 01:25:11.100]   You have to be within 800 feet of a millimeter wave.
[01:25:11.100 --> 01:25:13.100]   They don't care so much about it anymore.
[01:25:13.100 --> 01:25:14.780]   They don't see a band up.
[01:25:14.780 --> 01:25:17.660]   But C band is widely getting rolling out.
[01:25:17.660 --> 01:25:18.660]   T-Mobile does it.
[01:25:18.660 --> 01:25:19.660]   AT&T does it.
[01:25:19.660 --> 01:25:21.020]   Verizon does it.
[01:25:21.020 --> 01:25:26.300]   And I've tried C band with both my Pixel 6 running Veri-- or no, Samsung S22 running
[01:25:26.300 --> 01:25:27.300]   for Verizon.
[01:25:27.300 --> 01:25:33.940]   And this T-Mobile iPhone 12 Pro Max, 500 megabits down, 30 up.
[01:25:33.940 --> 01:25:35.460]   It's great.
[01:25:35.460 --> 01:25:36.260]   But who needs--
[01:25:36.260 --> 01:25:39.140]   Like two-year point, Alex.
[01:25:39.140 --> 01:25:40.500]   Nobody's going to notice.
[01:25:40.500 --> 01:25:43.980]   Because what are you doing that you need 500 megabits down?
[01:25:43.980 --> 01:25:44.500]   I don't know.
[01:25:44.500 --> 01:25:47.620]   I mean, the thing that I'm noticing with every phone that I buy
[01:25:47.620 --> 01:25:50.380]   is that my phone quality gets lower and lower and lower.
[01:25:50.380 --> 01:25:54.660]   So I'm constantly not sure whether--
[01:25:54.660 --> 01:25:58.020]   I just find that whether it's the other end or my end, that every time they keep--
[01:25:58.020 --> 01:26:00.780]   as they improve these things, yeah, we're getting more data.
[01:26:00.780 --> 01:26:02.540]   But when I'm actually talking to someone on the phone--
[01:26:02.540 --> 01:26:03.540]   That's what you are.
[01:26:03.540 --> 01:26:05.940]   Or FaceTime Audio or whatever.
[01:26:05.940 --> 01:26:07.420]   It's breaking up all the time.
[01:26:07.420 --> 01:26:08.980]   And it's a constant problem.
[01:26:08.980 --> 01:26:12.220]   I feel like I need an ethernet cable for my phone to actually talk to people.
[01:26:12.220 --> 01:26:13.820]   And it's just--
[01:26:13.820 --> 01:26:17.140]   So I remember when I got on a call and it just worked.
[01:26:17.140 --> 01:26:19.660]   And I haven't had that experience for four or five years.
[01:26:19.660 --> 01:26:20.580]   Yeah.
[01:26:20.580 --> 01:26:23.380]   So you can, I guess you can turn off--
[01:26:23.380 --> 01:26:25.260]   and maybe you should if you don't care--
[01:26:25.260 --> 01:26:28.620]   or you're not within range of any of these special towers.
[01:26:28.620 --> 01:26:32.380]   Turn off 5G and you'll probably get better results.
[01:26:32.380 --> 01:26:36.220]   Also, FaceTime goes HD on the phone if you're on a 5G network,
[01:26:36.220 --> 01:26:41.140]   which might be a bug more than a feature for you, depending on what your reception is.
[01:26:41.140 --> 01:26:42.300]   Yeah.
[01:26:42.300 --> 01:26:45.020]   I use FaceTime Audio all the time because it sounds way better.
[01:26:45.020 --> 01:26:46.100]   It does.
[01:26:46.100 --> 01:26:48.220]   Yeah, it does.
[01:26:48.220 --> 01:26:50.380]   Well, the phone system, they were trying to figure out
[01:26:50.380 --> 01:26:53.140]   how bad can we make it sad and still be intelligible?
[01:26:53.140 --> 01:26:55.900]   Back in the '20s or '10s.
[01:26:55.900 --> 01:26:59.060]   So it's basically like five-bit sound.
[01:26:59.060 --> 01:27:00.740]   It's really low quality.
[01:27:00.740 --> 01:27:03.300]   It's not digital, so it's not bits, but it's like that.
[01:27:03.300 --> 01:27:06.260]   And we can do much better now.
[01:27:06.260 --> 01:27:07.460]   And so FaceTime does.
[01:27:07.460 --> 01:27:11.660]   Also, just because I'm that jerk-off to do it every time.
[01:27:11.660 --> 01:27:15.140]   The 15 5G and 4G, isn't that great if you had good 4G?
[01:27:15.140 --> 01:27:17.580]   But 5G has just much better range and much better performance
[01:27:17.580 --> 01:27:21.100]   for people who never got good 4G.
[01:27:21.100 --> 01:27:23.740]   So for people like in the outskirts and rural areas and other places,
[01:27:23.740 --> 01:27:24.700]   it's delivering on that comment.
[01:27:24.700 --> 01:27:26.620]   You should test it, obviously.
[01:27:26.620 --> 01:27:29.660]   But if you're getting poor battery life and you turn off 5G
[01:27:29.660 --> 01:27:32.380]   and it's not changing anything else in your life,
[01:27:32.380 --> 01:27:35.620]   that might be a good way to save yourself.
[01:27:35.620 --> 01:27:36.860]   It's not using your phone for a while.
[01:27:36.860 --> 01:27:38.020]   Battery will be fine.
[01:27:38.020 --> 01:27:41.580]   Very big success for those mini LED MacBook Pros.
[01:27:41.580 --> 01:27:49.340]   They're outselling according to DSCC, the leader in advanced display market research.
[01:27:49.340 --> 01:27:50.900]   Oh, I have to log in.
[01:27:50.900 --> 01:27:53.900]   I have to log in to read it.
[01:27:53.900 --> 01:27:55.820]   Well, I'll just read the summary.
[01:27:55.820 --> 01:28:00.260]   New and mini LED MacBook Pros outsell all OLED laptops combined.
[01:28:00.260 --> 01:28:03.100]   Since there are only maybe five OLED laptops out there,
[01:28:03.100 --> 01:28:04.460]   I don't know if that's saying that much.
[01:28:04.460 --> 01:28:06.820]   But you're saying how much better known Ross Young has been
[01:28:06.820 --> 01:28:09.220]   since he started dropping leaks on Twitter.
[01:28:09.220 --> 01:28:10.900]   Ross Young did that.
[01:28:10.900 --> 01:28:11.420]   Yeah.
[01:28:11.420 --> 01:28:11.900]   There you go.
[01:28:11.900 --> 01:28:12.780]   That's his company.
[01:28:12.780 --> 01:28:13.740]   That's his company.
[01:28:13.740 --> 01:28:14.620]   Good.
[01:28:14.620 --> 01:28:15.700]   But I'm sorry, Ross.
[01:28:15.700 --> 01:28:18.780]   I'm not going to log in to read your display supply chain.
[01:28:18.780 --> 01:28:29.980]   You've got a report on iPhone notches up until, I think, 2030 at this point.
[01:28:29.980 --> 01:28:33.740]   If you have a creaky iPad Air 5, you're not alone.
[01:28:33.740 --> 01:28:39.700]   Users are complaining that the back of the iPad feels thin and makes creaking noises.
[01:28:39.700 --> 01:28:40.700]   OK, fine.
[01:28:40.700 --> 01:28:44.060]   I don't know how big a problem this is.
[01:28:44.060 --> 01:28:48.060]   Well, I mean, it's a problem on a device that you hold in your hand,
[01:28:48.060 --> 01:28:51.060]   but if you feel like the back of it's sort of bowing in a little bit,
[01:28:51.060 --> 01:28:54.300]   even if it's not a safety issue and it's not a survivability issue,
[01:28:54.300 --> 01:28:55.940]   it's like, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[01:28:55.940 --> 01:28:58.860]   And also, the first time you pick it up, you're very, very cognizant
[01:28:58.860 --> 01:29:01.220]   of how much you just spend on it, because that was like just 24 hours
[01:29:01.220 --> 01:29:02.660]   a week ago.
[01:29:02.660 --> 01:29:06.420]   It's a very thin, I guess, on the back, a very thin aluminum.
[01:29:06.420 --> 01:29:09.300]   Well, we'll find out in time whether this means that people who are tossing
[01:29:09.300 --> 01:29:14.980]   these things in backpacks or laptop bags wind up with broken or bent frames.
[01:29:14.980 --> 01:29:16.260]   That is a problem.
[01:29:16.260 --> 01:29:20.180]   Even when it's not so bad as to cause this thing to stop working,
[01:29:20.180 --> 01:29:25.020]   when you spend $600, $700, $900, $900, $000 on this thing,
[01:29:25.020 --> 01:29:27.340]   and then eight months later, you notice that you put on the table,
[01:29:27.340 --> 01:29:29.980]   and you notice it's wobbling just a little bit.
[01:29:29.980 --> 01:29:30.860]   That's not a good look.
[01:29:30.860 --> 01:29:31.780]   Yeah.
[01:29:31.780 --> 01:29:35.140]   It feels the same to me, like the four and the five.
[01:29:35.140 --> 01:29:37.140]   They don't creak any different to me.
[01:29:37.140 --> 01:29:39.860]   Verizon does say, and something in the chair, I'm saying, you know, they're--
[01:29:39.860 --> 01:29:43.460]   Oh, you have both, and yours is not creaking.
[01:29:43.460 --> 01:29:44.460]   No, not creaking at all.
[01:29:44.460 --> 01:29:45.460]   OK.
[01:29:45.460 --> 01:29:46.900]   So old phones used to creak.
[01:29:46.900 --> 01:29:47.900]   These are fine.
[01:29:47.900 --> 01:29:48.900]   Your mileage may vary.
[01:29:48.900 --> 01:29:49.900]   Yeah.
[01:29:49.900 --> 01:29:52.260]   As usual, every time there's a new piece of hardware,
[01:29:52.260 --> 01:29:54.900]   there will be a big wave of complaints.
[01:29:54.900 --> 01:30:00.060]   And the question is, a month later, are there still new complaints coming in?
[01:30:00.060 --> 01:30:02.700]   But this is something to take a look on, because this is a brand new design.
[01:30:02.700 --> 01:30:03.700]   Yeah.
[01:30:03.700 --> 01:30:04.700]   Yeah.
[01:30:04.700 --> 01:30:05.700]   And take yours back.
[01:30:05.700 --> 01:30:06.700]   Oh, yeah.
[01:30:06.700 --> 01:30:08.700]   Well, now we're going to find out.
[01:30:08.700 --> 01:30:09.220]   Take it.
[01:30:09.220 --> 01:30:09.820]   It's fine.
[01:30:09.820 --> 01:30:10.580]   Take yours back.
[01:30:10.580 --> 01:30:12.260]   If you do have any problems and you are concerned,
[01:30:12.260 --> 01:30:13.260]   there's like, they're very generous.
[01:30:13.260 --> 01:30:14.980]   And the points that all the time, they're very generous
[01:30:14.980 --> 01:30:16.420]   on a new product launches with their returns.
[01:30:16.420 --> 01:30:17.420]   Yeah.
[01:30:17.420 --> 01:30:18.420]   There you go.
[01:30:18.420 --> 01:30:22.860]   I am going to have to-- oh, actually, this is ultra wideband.
[01:30:22.860 --> 01:30:24.100]   So somebody in the chat was saying,
[01:30:24.100 --> 01:30:25.980]   is, well, Verizon's rolling out more millimeter wave.
[01:30:25.980 --> 01:30:28.340]   I don't know if they are not, but they are rolling out.
[01:30:28.340 --> 01:30:29.180]   No, they're lying.
[01:30:29.180 --> 01:30:31.700]   Well, they're calling CBAND.
[01:30:31.700 --> 01:30:36.300]   They're commingling CBAND millimeter wave to make it look like they have a bigger--
[01:30:36.300 --> 01:30:38.100]   So ultra wideband with a faster footprint.
[01:30:38.100 --> 01:30:43.020]   --c band is going to-- they say we cover 175 million people by the end of the year.
[01:30:43.020 --> 01:30:44.020]   And I can't get it here.
[01:30:44.020 --> 01:30:45.580]   It used to only be millimeter wave.
[01:30:45.580 --> 01:30:46.780]   Now they're conflating the two.
[01:30:46.780 --> 01:30:48.700]   It's like it looked like they have a bigger network.
[01:30:48.700 --> 01:30:51.140]   Yeah, I get UW on my Samsung.
[01:30:51.140 --> 01:30:52.820]   And it is fast.
[01:30:52.820 --> 01:30:55.900]   I'm getting that in Larkspur when I visit my daughter.
[01:30:55.900 --> 01:30:57.140]   In fact, it's so good.
[01:30:57.140 --> 01:31:03.060]   I thought I might even consider that Verizon home residential
[01:31:03.060 --> 01:31:04.060]   internet for her.
[01:31:04.060 --> 01:31:05.180]   Yeah, it's just so flaky.
[01:31:05.180 --> 01:31:06.300]   Like if it rains or the--
[01:31:06.300 --> 01:31:07.140]   --down on that issue.
[01:31:07.140 --> 01:31:09.060]   --like a leaf blows in the path and lines side.
[01:31:09.060 --> 01:31:11.820]   That's millimeter wave, or are you saying that's true for CBAND as well?
[01:31:11.820 --> 01:31:13.340]   Millimeter-- no, CBAND is great.
[01:31:13.340 --> 01:31:13.860]   CBAND is fine.
[01:31:13.860 --> 01:31:14.860]   It doesn't have millimeter wave.
[01:31:14.860 --> 01:31:16.300]   --such a high frequency.
[01:31:16.300 --> 01:31:16.820]   Yeah.
[01:31:16.820 --> 01:31:17.340]   Yeah.
[01:31:17.340 --> 01:31:17.860]   Yeah.
[01:31:17.860 --> 01:31:19.100]   It bounces off raindrops.
[01:31:19.100 --> 01:31:19.780]   Yeah.
[01:31:19.780 --> 01:31:20.460]   Literally.
[01:31:20.460 --> 01:31:24.100]   Yeah.
[01:31:24.100 --> 01:31:25.220]   I'm happy about this.
[01:31:25.220 --> 01:31:26.740]   I'm the only one who is.
[01:31:26.740 --> 01:31:33.980]   But my Mustang Mach-E is now going to have charging routing in Apple Maps.
[01:31:33.980 --> 01:31:37.020]   It's the only car in the world.
[01:31:37.020 --> 01:31:43.740]   Apple-- put this in Apple Maps, but the only Ford and BMW even said they were going
[01:31:43.740 --> 01:31:44.580]   to take advantage of it.
[01:31:44.580 --> 01:31:50.980]   And so far, the only cars at all that seem to be are the Ford Mustang Mach-E.
[01:31:50.980 --> 01:31:54.420]   Is this true that the Mustang is the only car that Ford still makes?
[01:31:54.420 --> 01:31:56.660]   They don't make any cars anymore except for the Mustang.
[01:31:56.660 --> 01:31:58.900]   Because the trucks are so successful for them.
[01:31:58.900 --> 01:32:01.820]   Their F-150 is such a good business.
[01:32:01.820 --> 01:32:02.740]   I wouldn't be surprised.
[01:32:02.740 --> 01:32:07.020]   They've decided to divide their business into EVs and gas vehicles,
[01:32:07.020 --> 01:32:08.580]   petro vehicles.
[01:32:08.580 --> 01:32:09.700]   So that's going to be interesting.
[01:32:09.700 --> 01:32:10.860]   I think like all the other--
[01:32:10.860 --> 01:32:13.140]   And they're doing four cars forever, and they're gone now.
[01:32:13.140 --> 01:32:14.140]   Yeah.
[01:32:14.140 --> 01:32:15.940]   Isn't that amazing?
[01:32:15.940 --> 01:32:18.940]   And hey, good news.
[01:32:18.940 --> 01:32:23.420]   If you're still using a tile, they've launched anti-stalking safety
[01:32:23.420 --> 01:32:25.980]   in its mobile app.
[01:32:25.980 --> 01:32:26.740]   Jobs, bless.
[01:32:26.740 --> 01:32:28.260]   Yeah.
[01:32:28.260 --> 01:32:32.940]   I think that's just to have parity with Apple.
[01:32:32.940 --> 01:32:33.460]   Even though it's not--
[01:32:33.460 --> 01:32:34.620]   Well, they knew they were next.
[01:32:34.620 --> 01:32:36.700]   Yeah.
[01:32:36.700 --> 01:32:38.700]   Jadil, just let you know that there's somebody--
[01:32:38.700 --> 01:32:39.860]   there's a tile.
[01:32:39.860 --> 01:32:42.260]   You can scan for unknown tiles.
[01:32:42.260 --> 01:32:43.260]   I don't think tiles--
[01:32:43.260 --> 01:32:45.820]   tile works basically the same as the air techs,
[01:32:45.820 --> 01:32:47.980]   except that there are a lot more iPhones in the world
[01:32:47.980 --> 01:32:50.140]   than there are tiles in the world.
[01:32:50.140 --> 01:32:52.340]   That's always-- well, not only that, but it's always--
[01:32:52.340 --> 01:32:53.340]   I'm sorry.
[01:32:53.340 --> 01:32:55.060]   It's going to only be scanned by people
[01:32:55.060 --> 01:32:56.580]   who have installed the app on their phone
[01:32:56.580 --> 01:33:00.340]   versus every single iPhone in America is tracking you.
[01:33:00.340 --> 01:33:01.340]   So that's--
[01:33:01.340 --> 01:33:03.300]   Although tiles using Amazon's network now, I think,
[01:33:03.300 --> 01:33:04.660]   and they've greatly increased their--
[01:33:04.660 --> 01:33:06.140]   Oh, that's right.
[01:33:06.140 --> 01:33:07.140]   They're using sidewalk?
[01:33:07.140 --> 01:33:08.380]   Is that what they're using?
[01:33:08.380 --> 01:33:09.380]   Yeah.
[01:33:09.380 --> 01:33:09.880]   OK.
[01:33:09.880 --> 01:33:10.820]   I didn't heard that.
[01:33:10.820 --> 01:33:13.220]   I don't know how many people have sidewalk on.
[01:33:13.220 --> 01:33:14.460]   Oh, but it'd be like you.
[01:33:14.460 --> 01:33:15.820]   They're going to build out.
[01:33:15.820 --> 01:33:16.740]   It will help.
[01:33:16.740 --> 01:33:18.260]   That's for sure.
[01:33:18.260 --> 01:33:20.900]   I am going to take a little break.
[01:33:20.900 --> 01:33:24.260]   So if you would, please prepare your picks of the week
[01:33:24.260 --> 01:33:25.580]   coming up next.

[01:33:58.700 --> 01:34:02.580]   Melissa capped off last year by reaching a milestone, 30 billion.
[01:34:02.580 --> 01:34:06.220]   30 billion with a B, North American address lookups
[01:34:06.220 --> 01:34:06.740]   in the year.
[01:34:06.740 --> 01:34:08.420]   That's the most ever.
[01:34:08.420 --> 01:34:11.860]   People love Melissa because people move.
[01:34:11.860 --> 01:34:12.740]   Emails change.
[01:34:12.740 --> 01:34:14.380]   Names change.
[01:34:14.380 --> 01:34:15.980]   You want to keep track of your customers.
[01:34:15.980 --> 01:34:19.100]   You don't want to be sending bills, brochures, catalogs
[01:34:19.100 --> 01:34:22.420]   to the wrong address, calling the wrong number.
[01:34:22.420 --> 01:34:24.580]   Melissa's global address verification service
[01:34:24.580 --> 01:34:28.340]   works for addresses in 240 plus countries and territories.
[01:34:28.340 --> 01:34:30.780]   And because you can get Melissa in a variety of ways,
[01:34:30.780 --> 01:34:32.500]   you can even have it work at the point of entry
[01:34:32.500 --> 01:34:33.780]   because they have an API.
[01:34:33.780 --> 01:34:35.100]   You could build it into your software.
[01:34:35.100 --> 01:34:38.660]   A lot of customer service software includes Melissa.
[01:34:38.660 --> 01:34:40.860]   A lot of shopping cart software, who's Melissa,
[01:34:40.860 --> 01:34:42.060]   you might even have experienced it
[01:34:42.060 --> 01:34:43.340]   where you start typing in the address.
[01:34:43.340 --> 01:34:45.220]   And Melissa says, yeah, you mean this?
[01:34:45.220 --> 01:34:46.980]   Or your zip code's wrong.
[01:34:46.980 --> 01:34:49.500]   Let's fix it.
[01:34:49.500 --> 01:34:50.860]   Melissa can do so much.
[01:34:50.860 --> 01:34:53.500]   They can eliminate duplicate customer information
[01:34:53.500 --> 01:34:55.660]   in your database with data matching.
[01:34:55.660 --> 01:34:56.580]   That helps save money.
[01:34:56.580 --> 01:34:59.700]   You don't want to send multiple catalogs to the same person.
[01:34:59.700 --> 01:35:02.020]   You can do batch cleansing, upload it
[01:35:02.020 --> 01:35:04.340]   to their secure FTP server, and process
[01:35:04.340 --> 01:35:07.820]   the entire list for accuracy and completeness, then download it.
[01:35:07.820 --> 01:35:10.340]   They can help you with the identity verification, too.
[01:35:10.340 --> 01:35:13.020]   Reduce risk and show compliance.
[01:35:13.020 --> 01:35:14.500]   Keep customers happy.
[01:35:14.500 --> 01:35:17.180]   They can do geo-coding, insert latitude and longitude
[01:35:17.180 --> 01:35:20.740]   right there into the address as you go.
[01:35:20.740 --> 01:35:21.660]   Look at that.
[01:35:21.660 --> 01:35:23.500]   That's so cool.
[01:35:23.500 --> 01:35:24.980]   Email verification, they can remove
[01:35:24.980 --> 01:35:28.460]   about 95% of bad email addresses from your database.
[01:35:28.460 --> 01:35:30.300]   And because you can get it the way you want it.
[01:35:30.300 --> 01:35:33.820]   On-prem as a web service, I mentioned FTP.
[01:35:33.820 --> 01:35:35.380]   Software as a service.
[01:35:35.380 --> 01:35:37.940]   Lookups, plural app on iOS.
[01:35:37.940 --> 01:35:40.620]   It's on Android as well to search addresses, names,
[01:35:40.620 --> 01:35:42.940]   and more right there in your phone.

[01:35:47.340 --> 01:35:50.100]   as the solid goal it is with complete privacy.
[01:35:50.100 --> 01:35:53.500]   They undergo continuous independent security audits.
[01:35:53.500 --> 01:35:56.940]   If you have to be SOC 2 or HIPAA or GDPR compliant,
[01:35:56.940 --> 01:36:01.340]   you'll be glad that no Melissa does is compliant.
[01:36:01.340 --> 01:36:03.500]   Melissa's industry leading products and services
[01:36:03.500 --> 01:36:06.380]   and power improved business communications,
[01:36:06.380 --> 01:36:08.940]   more profitable customer relationships,

[01:37:10.180 --> 01:37:14.500]   Andy Inato, it's time for your pick of the week.
[01:37:14.500 --> 01:37:19.180]   My pick of the week is yet another idea
[01:37:19.180 --> 01:37:22.820]   sort of blobby organizer, form it in your head,
[01:37:22.820 --> 01:37:24.940]   Isaac, a literature latte,
[01:37:24.940 --> 01:37:28.100]   make my favorite word processor, Scrivener,
[01:37:28.100 --> 01:37:30.900]   which is what I do all my projects on, books, columns,
[01:37:30.900 --> 01:37:34.500]   scripts for radio shows, everything.
[01:37:34.500 --> 01:37:37.460]   And they also have this really cool app called Scapple,
[01:37:37.460 --> 01:37:39.740]   which is, again, it's hard to define.
[01:37:39.740 --> 01:37:42.780]   It's one of those apps that takes the ideas in your head
[01:37:42.780 --> 01:37:44.300]   and lets you, and information,
[01:37:44.300 --> 01:37:46.340]   and just put it on something.
[01:37:46.340 --> 01:37:49.020]   Basically, it's an infinite chalkboard
[01:37:49.020 --> 01:37:51.140]   where you can stick notes to.
[01:37:51.140 --> 01:37:53.660]   And that seems like something that anybody could code up
[01:37:53.660 --> 01:37:55.540]   in about 10 seconds as if they're taking
[01:37:55.540 --> 01:37:58.020]   an introductory programming course.
[01:37:58.020 --> 01:38:00.020]   But they've done this so very, very well
[01:38:00.020 --> 01:38:04.220]   in that there are other apps that are like this
[01:38:04.220 --> 01:38:06.380]   that try to impose a structure on you,
[01:38:06.380 --> 01:38:08.860]   that try to say, well, here's how you're gonna tag this thing,
[01:38:08.860 --> 01:38:10.980]   and here's how you're gonna categorize and color things.
[01:38:10.980 --> 01:38:12.740]   This app, it actually just works like,
[01:38:12.740 --> 01:38:14.020]   look, here is a whiteboard.
[01:38:14.020 --> 01:38:15.500]   Put whatever you want on it.
[01:38:15.500 --> 01:38:17.980]   If you want to move them around and group things together,
[01:38:17.980 --> 01:38:18.820]   you can do that.
[01:38:18.820 --> 01:38:20.500]   If you wanna put arrows between things
[01:38:20.500 --> 01:38:24.020]   and create links to it, you can do that as well.
[01:38:24.020 --> 01:38:27.340]   And so it's a great thing for this research project
[01:38:27.340 --> 01:38:29.220]   that I've been doing for years and years and years,
[01:38:29.220 --> 01:38:31.220]   where there are just so many different subjects,
[01:38:31.220 --> 01:38:33.620]   and actually I've been keeping my notes straight
[01:38:33.620 --> 01:38:36.380]   in Scrivener for all this time.
[01:38:36.380 --> 01:38:39.020]   But there are times when I just wanna see what I have,
[01:38:39.020 --> 01:38:41.420]   or I just wanna have this second screen,
[01:38:41.420 --> 01:38:43.940]   this is a brilliant full screen app,
[01:38:43.940 --> 01:38:47.100]   because again, if you just wanna surface
[01:38:47.100 --> 01:38:49.180]   to just put something down on,
[01:38:49.180 --> 01:38:51.220]   this is a great, your second or third monitor,
[01:38:51.220 --> 01:38:52.900]   this is a great place to put it.
[01:38:52.900 --> 01:38:54.940]   And being able to take all this into research
[01:38:54.940 --> 01:38:59.020]   and simply saying, okay, here are the three primary people
[01:38:59.020 --> 01:39:00.980]   that are associated with this story.
[01:39:00.980 --> 01:39:02.420]   And then what are their timelines?
[01:39:02.420 --> 01:39:03.500]   What are their pictures?
[01:39:03.500 --> 01:39:05.540]   What are their, what are their,
[01:39:05.540 --> 01:39:09.220]   what are the newspaper articles that are related to them?
[01:39:09.220 --> 01:39:11.660]   It's very, very easy to just throw this together
[01:39:11.660 --> 01:39:13.820]   and then always have this ready for you
[01:39:13.820 --> 01:39:15.260]   so that you can just look at things.
[01:39:15.260 --> 01:39:17.660]   People are not, I also use Omni-Outliner
[01:39:17.660 --> 01:39:19.140]   for stuff like this, I love it.
[01:39:19.140 --> 01:39:22.860]   But sometimes the best way to get your head around something
[01:39:22.860 --> 01:39:24.740]   is a visual approach.
[01:39:24.740 --> 01:39:26.460]   Since I installed it, it's been around for years,
[01:39:26.460 --> 01:39:29.220]   I really just put it on my computer like two or three weeks ago.
[01:39:29.220 --> 01:39:31.860]   But ever since I dedicated like an entire screen to this,
[01:39:31.860 --> 01:39:34.540]   it's very, very easy for my brain to realize that,
[01:39:34.540 --> 01:39:36.180]   oh, if I want this piece of information,
[01:39:36.180 --> 01:39:38.860]   it's gonna be located here on this sector of the screen
[01:39:38.860 --> 01:39:40.460]   'cause that's where I left it.
[01:39:40.460 --> 01:39:42.740]   And it's been very, very useful.
[01:39:42.740 --> 01:39:44.460]   This is again, emphatically,
[01:39:44.460 --> 01:39:48.820]   if you want to use it as a window on a MacBook screen,
[01:39:48.820 --> 01:39:50.500]   it's probably not gonna be that effective.
[01:39:50.500 --> 01:39:52.980]   As a separate workspace, it works great,
[01:39:52.980 --> 01:39:56.060]   but as something that's on its own, like 24-inch monitor,
[01:39:56.060 --> 01:39:57.540]   it's absolutely brilliant.
[01:39:57.540 --> 01:39:58.660]   Nice.
[01:39:58.660 --> 01:40:00.140]   Scapel.
[01:40:00.140 --> 01:40:01.740]   18 bucks, but there's a free trial mode
[01:40:01.740 --> 01:40:03.900]   with all features unlocked for, I think, for about a month.
[01:40:03.900 --> 01:40:05.860]   Oh, that's a good deal, actually.
[01:40:05.860 --> 01:40:06.860]   Yeah.
[01:40:06.860 --> 01:40:09.380]   From, as you say, literatureandlotte.com
[01:40:09.380 --> 01:40:10.380]   and since you're in the library,
[01:40:10.380 --> 01:40:11.820]   I think that's very appropriate literature.
[01:40:11.820 --> 01:40:12.660]   Exactly.
[01:40:12.660 --> 01:40:14.980]   And latte-scapel.
[01:40:14.980 --> 01:40:16.740]   Literature and tap-water, in my case.
[01:40:16.740 --> 01:40:18.980]   (laughing)
[01:40:20.340 --> 01:40:22.180]   I love drinking fountain water,
[01:40:22.180 --> 01:40:24.300]   library drinking fountain water, best guide.
[01:40:24.300 --> 01:40:26.140]   Alex Lindsey, pick of the week.
[01:40:26.140 --> 01:40:29.060]   So this has been long-awaited,
[01:40:29.060 --> 01:40:31.940]   and I think it's ripping through the audio world.
[01:40:31.940 --> 01:40:32.860]   Automate, finally.
[01:40:32.860 --> 01:40:35.260]   Automate makes hardware,
[01:40:35.260 --> 01:40:38.180]   or makes a thing called Dante Virtual Soundcard.
[01:40:38.180 --> 01:40:41.380]   Now, what this does is if you're already on Dante,
[01:40:41.380 --> 01:40:43.740]   it means that you can have your Mac,
[01:40:43.740 --> 01:40:45.860]   you don't have to have any hardware for it.
[01:40:45.860 --> 01:40:48.820]   You can just plug it in and it'll be available to your mixer.
[01:40:48.820 --> 01:40:52.820]   So all of our mixers are Dante.
[01:40:52.820 --> 01:40:54.620]   We have cards that we put into them
[01:40:54.620 --> 01:40:56.340]   that make them on a Dante network.
[01:40:56.340 --> 01:40:58.940]   And that makes it really easy for us to route audio.
[01:40:58.940 --> 01:40:59.900]   So we can basically have,
[01:40:59.900 --> 01:41:02.100]   we can route all this audio from one place to the other.
[01:41:02.100 --> 01:41:04.580]   Without Dante Virtual Soundcard,
[01:41:04.580 --> 01:41:08.100]   we have to basically put a little piece of hardware
[01:41:08.100 --> 01:41:12.300]   to convert our audio to Dante.
[01:41:12.300 --> 01:41:13.700]   It comes out of the computer.
[01:41:13.700 --> 01:41:16.500]   And with Dante Virtual Soundcard,
[01:41:16.500 --> 01:41:18.420]   it means the computer just has inputs,
[01:41:18.420 --> 01:41:22.140]   like four input, or two and two out kind of thing.
[01:41:22.140 --> 01:41:24.340]   It might be four and four out.
[01:41:24.340 --> 01:41:26.660]   Anyway, so the point is,
[01:41:26.660 --> 01:41:29.500]   is that it is now available on the M1.
[01:41:29.500 --> 01:41:30.860]   We've been waiting for,
[01:41:30.860 --> 01:41:34.700]   many of us have been waiting for this for a long time.
[01:41:34.700 --> 01:41:37.460]   So it's taken them a long time for whatever reason
[01:41:37.460 --> 01:41:39.980]   to get it compatible with the M1.
[01:41:39.980 --> 01:41:41.100]   A lot of audio,
[01:41:41.100 --> 01:41:44.580]   a lot of audio software has been having trouble
[01:41:44.580 --> 01:41:46.620]   getting M1 compliant.
[01:41:46.620 --> 01:41:48.060]   And so they finally did it.
[01:41:48.060 --> 01:41:50.900]   And so it's a really powerful piece of software
[01:41:50.900 --> 01:41:52.260]   that gets your computer.
[01:41:52.260 --> 01:41:54.100]   You do want to have something in your network
[01:41:54.100 --> 01:41:56.580]   that has the Dante chip in it,
[01:41:56.580 --> 01:41:57.780]   'cause that helps with the clocking,
[01:41:57.780 --> 01:42:01.060]   but you can now add lots of computers.
[01:42:01.060 --> 01:42:04.420]   So for instance, instead of buying lots of pieces of hardware,
[01:42:04.420 --> 01:42:08.700]   Office Hours uses, I think, well, at least five IMACs,
[01:42:08.700 --> 01:42:11.700]   or sorry, I mean, Mac Minis, M1 Mac Minis,
[01:42:11.700 --> 01:42:13.980]   six actually, M1 Mac Minis.
[01:42:13.980 --> 01:42:17.540]   And right now, they all were taking audio out.
[01:42:17.540 --> 01:42:19.780]   We would have to take audio out one at a time
[01:42:19.780 --> 01:42:21.740]   with their audio outputs.
[01:42:21.740 --> 01:42:24.780]   Now what we can do is actually just put them on Dante,
[01:42:24.780 --> 01:42:26.780]   and they'll all be, like, a network of them
[01:42:26.780 --> 01:42:28.420]   and put them into any device that we have
[01:42:28.420 --> 01:42:30.300]   on the network that's in Dante.
[01:42:30.300 --> 01:42:33.180]   - If I was gonna set up a new studio,
[01:42:33.180 --> 01:42:35.180]   I might put like all,
[01:42:35.180 --> 01:42:38.180]   everything on ethernet and,
[01:42:38.180 --> 01:42:40.340]   yeah, and everything would talk to each other.
[01:42:40.340 --> 01:42:41.180]   - And then if everything has,
[01:42:41.180 --> 01:42:43.220]   you can get this for the PC or the Mac.
[01:42:43.220 --> 01:42:45.140]   It is now all of your computers.
[01:42:45.140 --> 01:42:46.020]   You want to have one thing,
[01:42:46.020 --> 01:42:47.820]   like you might have a mixer,
[01:42:47.820 --> 01:42:48.900]   that might be like an X32,
[01:42:48.900 --> 01:42:53.060]   a Barynger X32 is what a lot of us use in our home setups.
[01:42:53.060 --> 01:42:54.380]   - Got one of those, yeah.
[01:42:54.380 --> 01:42:55.580]   - Yeah, so the Barynger X32,
[01:42:55.580 --> 01:42:57.180]   you put a Dante card into that,
[01:42:57.180 --> 01:42:59.340]   and then now any computers
[01:42:59.340 --> 01:43:00.660]   that you put the virtual sound card on,
[01:43:00.660 --> 01:43:01.980]   which is like 30 bucks,
[01:43:01.980 --> 01:43:03.820]   you can see it and you can just route it
[01:43:03.820 --> 01:43:06.420]   to different inputs effortlessly.
[01:43:06.420 --> 01:43:07.260]   - That's really cool.
[01:43:07.260 --> 01:43:08.500]   - Yeah, and where it gets really interesting
[01:43:08.500 --> 01:43:10.380]   is that you use something like loopback,
[01:43:10.380 --> 01:43:11.820]   and loopback and see the Dante.
[01:43:11.820 --> 01:43:14.500]   So now you can do all kinds of very complicated loop,
[01:43:14.500 --> 01:43:17.620]   you know, audio loops in and out of applications
[01:43:17.620 --> 01:43:20.380]   with and access anything that's available
[01:43:20.380 --> 01:43:22.220]   on that Dante network.
[01:43:22.220 --> 01:43:25.260]   - Dante from Audinate, A-U-D-I-N-A-T-E.
[01:43:25.260 --> 01:43:30.260]   Now M1 enabled the Dante virtual sound card.
[01:43:30.260 --> 01:43:33.300]   Renee Richie, pick of the week.
[01:43:33.300 --> 01:43:34.780]   - So I know you must have discussed this already,
[01:43:34.780 --> 01:43:35.620]   but I wasn't here,
[01:43:35.620 --> 01:43:38.780]   so I thought I would bring up the new iPhone SE again,
[01:43:38.780 --> 01:43:41.740]   because it's a very interesting phone.
[01:43:41.740 --> 01:43:43.180]   For people who are watching this show,
[01:43:43.180 --> 01:43:45.780]   I imagine all of us have the latest,
[01:43:45.780 --> 01:43:47.980]   well, maybe not Andy, but he's thinking about it,
[01:43:47.980 --> 01:43:50.740]   the latest greatest iPhone imaginable.
[01:43:50.740 --> 01:43:52.340]   You know, and we're only ever gonna upgrade
[01:43:52.340 --> 01:43:54.540]   to the latest greatest iPhone imaginable.
[01:43:54.540 --> 01:43:57.140]   But there are, I don't know how big a group is,
[01:43:57.140 --> 01:43:59.300]   but there is a significant enough for Apple to want
[01:43:59.300 --> 01:44:01.820]   to address group of people who still love them,
[01:44:01.820 --> 01:44:02.660]   their home button,
[01:44:02.660 --> 01:44:05.060]   nothing to do with gesture notifications.
[01:44:05.060 --> 01:44:09.420]   Don't care at all about chunky beard and goatee,
[01:44:09.420 --> 01:44:11.980]   sorry, high top bezels.
[01:44:11.980 --> 01:44:15.700]   They just, they want the iPhone that they grew up having,
[01:44:15.700 --> 01:44:17.940]   one that Steve Jobs introduced.
[01:44:17.940 --> 01:44:20.860]   They have no care or concern for OLED or for,
[01:44:20.860 --> 01:44:21.700]   like, so enough, I have to,
[01:44:21.700 --> 01:44:23.300]   but any of those fancy features.
[01:44:23.300 --> 01:44:24.380]   And they just don't want to pay a lot.
[01:44:24.380 --> 01:44:25.780]   They don't want to pay a dollar more than they have to
[01:44:25.780 --> 01:44:27.860]   for an iPhone, but they do want an iPhone
[01:44:27.860 --> 01:44:30.060]   that still feels new and snappy.
[01:44:30.060 --> 01:44:31.500]   For the vast majority of people,
[01:44:31.500 --> 01:44:34.700]   I would still recommend an iPhone 11 over an iPhone SE,
[01:44:34.700 --> 01:44:35.980]   because it's only like, you know,
[01:44:35.980 --> 01:44:37.700]   70 bucks more for the base model,
[01:44:37.700 --> 01:44:39.780]   and it does have that modern experience
[01:44:39.780 --> 01:44:42.140]   that fuller screen dual camera system,
[01:44:42.140 --> 01:44:44.300]   a lot of the modern amenities to it.
[01:44:44.300 --> 01:44:47.580]   But some people just really want that classic,
[01:44:47.580 --> 01:44:50.180]   traditional iPhone.
[01:44:50.180 --> 01:44:52.580]   And this, because it's got the latest processor,
[01:44:52.580 --> 01:44:55.700]   it's going to get iOS updates for years and years to come.
[01:44:55.700 --> 01:44:58.260]   In the original iPhone SE from 2016,
[01:44:58.260 --> 01:45:00.500]   just got iOS 15 last year.
[01:45:00.500 --> 01:45:03.180]   So like, they're supported for a ridiculous amount of time.
[01:45:03.180 --> 01:45:06.420]   The build quality is ACES, so they last a long time.
[01:45:06.420 --> 01:45:08.860]   I don't know what kind of dark magic Apple conjured
[01:45:08.860 --> 01:45:09.940]   for the battery life.
[01:45:09.940 --> 01:45:13.300]   It's some mix of A15, just being a cooler chip.
[01:45:13.300 --> 01:45:16.380]   You know, battery chemistry, better at keeping out
[01:45:16.380 --> 01:45:19.620]   the degradation that that usually occurs.
[01:45:19.620 --> 01:45:22.740]   iOS 15 on itself is slightly more optimized,
[01:45:22.740 --> 01:45:24.140]   and the battery is 10% bigger.
[01:45:24.140 --> 01:45:25.420]   So you put all that together,
[01:45:25.420 --> 01:45:27.620]   and it gets like two hours longer battery life.
[01:45:27.620 --> 01:45:29.620]   So for anyone who really,
[01:45:29.620 --> 01:45:31.660]   any of our family members or friends
[01:45:31.660 --> 01:45:35.060]   who really just wants a classic iPhone experience,
[01:45:35.060 --> 01:45:37.860]   you've got a new iPhone SE available.
[01:45:37.860 --> 01:45:40.460]   It's 30 bucks more because every phone with 5G,
[01:45:40.460 --> 01:45:43.340]   those modems are expensive, Qualcomm going to get paid.
[01:45:43.340 --> 01:45:45.740]   But, you know, over the course of five, six years,
[01:45:45.740 --> 01:45:48.140]   if you keep it that long, not a huge difference.
[01:45:48.140 --> 01:45:50.140]   So if you wanted a new iPhone,
[01:45:50.140 --> 01:45:52.540]   that's not an expensive iPhone, the iPhone SE is that.
[01:45:52.540 --> 01:45:54.700]   - I tell everybody in the radio show to get it.
[01:45:54.700 --> 01:45:57.100]   That's the radio audience right there.
[01:45:57.100 --> 01:45:57.940]   - That's the demo.
[01:45:57.940 --> 01:46:00.300]   - Yeah, that's the demo, 100 plus.
[01:46:00.300 --> 01:46:01.140]   - So, yeah.
[01:46:01.140 --> 01:46:06.500]   So I'm going to have to ask Alex to explain all this to me.
[01:46:06.500 --> 01:46:08.580]   I've been building a,
[01:46:08.580 --> 01:46:10.780]   this will be for the cruise to Alaska,
[01:46:10.780 --> 01:46:15.260]   portable audio podcasting recording setup.
[01:46:15.260 --> 01:46:19.100]   So I've got my Pelican case with the SM58s and all that stuff.
[01:46:19.100 --> 01:46:21.740]   But what I got, and the product I want to mention
[01:46:21.740 --> 01:46:26.540]   is this Zoom, the new Zoom F3 field recorder.
[01:46:26.540 --> 01:46:27.980]   And this is, look how little that is.
[01:46:27.980 --> 01:46:31.100]   Takes two AA batteries and records, you know,
[01:46:31.100 --> 01:46:32.460]   probably about eight or nine hours
[01:46:32.460 --> 01:46:34.860]   with it has a little micro SD card,
[01:46:34.860 --> 01:46:37.420]   which can hold 99 hours on this one,
[01:46:37.420 --> 01:46:39.060]   because it's 256 gigs.
[01:46:39.060 --> 01:46:42.300]   It has two XLR jacks, it provides fan and power,
[01:46:42.300 --> 01:46:43.900]   even at 48 volts.
[01:46:43.900 --> 01:46:46.660]   So it's a nice little recording rig.
[01:46:46.660 --> 01:46:48.740]   But the thing that makes this very interesting,
[01:46:48.740 --> 01:46:52.460]   it's audio only, besides the size, by the way,
[01:46:52.460 --> 01:46:54.740]   they show pictures of people strapping it
[01:46:54.740 --> 01:46:57.860]   to their pole for their microphone.
[01:46:57.860 --> 01:46:59.340]   It's that light and small,
[01:46:59.340 --> 01:47:00.860]   or you could wear it around your wrist
[01:47:00.860 --> 01:47:02.220]   'cause it's got these bars.
[01:47:02.220 --> 01:47:03.260]   But the thing that makes it interesting,
[01:47:03.260 --> 01:47:05.540]   is we're gonna defer to Alex on this,
[01:47:05.540 --> 01:47:09.020]   they call it 32-bit float recording.
[01:47:09.020 --> 01:47:11.900]   So we know CDs are 16-bit,
[01:47:11.900 --> 01:47:15.060]   some lot of music is recorded at 24-bit,
[01:47:15.060 --> 01:47:17.820]   that's the sample rate, not the sample rate,
[01:47:17.820 --> 01:47:21.700]   the sample bit depth, not the sample rate.
[01:47:21.700 --> 01:47:26.100]   So a CD is 44,100 samples per second at 16 bits.
[01:47:26.100 --> 01:47:27.500]   But this is 32-bit float.
[01:47:27.500 --> 01:47:29.340]   And what Zoom says, and I have to say,
[01:47:29.340 --> 01:47:32.500]   I've been able to confirm it, by yelling at it,
[01:47:32.500 --> 01:47:35.700]   is you can't clip the recorder,
[01:47:35.700 --> 01:47:37.460]   you can clip the microphone, obviously,
[01:47:37.460 --> 01:47:39.980]   but you can't clip the recorder
[01:47:39.980 --> 01:47:43.180]   because there's so much headroom with 32-bit float.
[01:47:43.180 --> 01:47:45.060]   Am I saying that directly?
[01:47:45.060 --> 01:47:46.980]   Yeah, yeah, basically what happens is,
[01:47:46.980 --> 01:47:50.020]   there's still a dynamic range within the preamp
[01:47:50.020 --> 01:47:53.260]   that you're getting, but if you look at it,
[01:47:53.260 --> 01:47:55.740]   your preamp is living in this little world of, let's say,
[01:47:55.740 --> 01:48:00.740]   120 dB, but it's illustrating the side of here.
[01:48:01.580 --> 01:48:02.420]   I was listening at home.
[01:48:02.420 --> 01:48:03.260]   Oh, sorry.
[01:48:03.260 --> 01:48:04.580]   (laughing)
[01:48:04.580 --> 01:48:05.420]   That's awesome.
[01:48:05.420 --> 01:48:07.380]   But this is the range of 32-bit float.
[01:48:07.380 --> 01:48:09.100]   So it's this tiny little range that you have here,
[01:48:09.100 --> 01:48:11.540]   but 32-foot float is like plus or minus 1400 dB
[01:48:11.540 --> 01:48:12.660]   or something like that.
[01:48:12.660 --> 01:48:15.540]   So you can't get to, I mean, it's plus or minus 700,
[01:48:15.540 --> 01:48:18.740]   and I meant 1400 total, but it's plus or minus 700
[01:48:18.740 --> 01:48:19.660]   and some dB, 44 is not.
[01:48:19.660 --> 01:48:20.500]   Plenty.
[01:48:20.500 --> 01:48:22.340]   A lot.
[01:48:22.340 --> 01:48:23.580]   I don't have that number on top of my head.
[01:48:23.580 --> 01:48:27.100]   You could whisper and scream, you could play a instrument
[01:48:27.100 --> 01:48:29.140]   in a whole orchestra and you would not be able to
[01:48:29.140 --> 01:48:30.740]   fill with the dynamic range.
[01:48:30.740 --> 01:48:33.060]   Yeah, like for instance, a good example is if you were
[01:48:33.060 --> 01:48:35.620]   recording a gun or something like that,
[01:48:35.620 --> 01:48:39.780]   you could capture the blast and capture the shells,
[01:48:39.780 --> 01:48:42.540]   hitting the ground or whatever, because it's gonna get,
[01:48:42.540 --> 01:48:44.300]   normally you can't do anything like that.
[01:48:44.300 --> 01:48:46.220]   So for recording those kinds of things,
[01:48:46.220 --> 01:48:49.100]   what it really does from a production perspective
[01:48:49.100 --> 01:48:52.780]   is that you have a lot, your target to hit
[01:48:52.780 --> 01:48:55.300]   when you're in the field is much larger.
[01:48:55.300 --> 01:48:59.580]   So now what happens is, oh, you recorded it too low,
[01:48:59.580 --> 01:49:00.460]   you can recover it.
[01:49:00.460 --> 01:49:01.980]   Oh, you recorded it a little too loud.
[01:49:01.980 --> 01:49:03.300]   You can't really record too loud,
[01:49:03.300 --> 01:49:05.660]   but the biggest problem you have is that suddenly
[01:49:05.660 --> 01:49:09.500]   someone's really loud or you didn't get it turned up enough
[01:49:09.500 --> 01:49:11.620]   and you can always bring it back
[01:49:11.620 --> 01:49:13.820]   because all that data is actually there.
[01:49:13.820 --> 01:49:15.980]   And so it is, there's still dynamic range
[01:49:15.980 --> 01:49:17.500]   within the preamp that you have there.
[01:49:17.500 --> 01:49:20.340]   And there's a pretty good preamp and it's pretty good.
[01:49:20.340 --> 01:49:22.580]   I mean, the quality I'm getting out of is pretty good.
[01:49:22.580 --> 01:49:23.420]   Yeah.
[01:49:23.420 --> 01:49:24.580]   Yeah, 350 bucks.
[01:49:24.580 --> 01:49:26.020]   Good, let's put it that way.
[01:49:26.020 --> 01:49:26.780]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:49:26.780 --> 01:49:30.220]   And 32-bit float, I mean, so we've been using 32-bit float
[01:49:30.220 --> 01:49:32.140]   for a while because sound devices put it into all
[01:49:32.140 --> 01:49:33.340]   of their stuff a while ago.
[01:49:33.340 --> 01:49:36.340]   And there's actually a great paper about 32-bit float
[01:49:36.340 --> 01:49:39.660]   on sound devices website about it as when they released it
[01:49:39.660 --> 01:49:40.460]   a couple of years ago.
[01:49:40.460 --> 01:49:41.460]   And so--
[01:49:41.460 --> 01:49:45.380]   Oh, so I have that in my USB pre, I just didn't know it.
[01:49:45.380 --> 01:49:50.020]   In your, in the mix pre two, I believe.
[01:49:50.020 --> 01:49:52.300]   I don't know if it's in mix pre one.
[01:49:52.300 --> 01:49:53.060]   Yeah, so the--
[01:49:53.060 --> 01:49:54.580]   I have a three, I think.
[01:49:54.580 --> 01:49:55.780]   Mix pre two, yeah.
[01:49:55.780 --> 01:49:58.060]   Mix pre two, mix pre three two.
[01:49:58.060 --> 01:50:00.980]   OK, yeah, it should have the 32-bit float.
[01:50:00.980 --> 01:50:01.980]   I don't think that the first one--
[01:50:01.980 --> 01:50:04.180]   This can be used the same way, which is kind of interesting.
[01:50:04.180 --> 01:50:06.980]   You can plug your mic into it and it has a Type C connector
[01:50:06.980 --> 01:50:08.340]   and pass it through.
[01:50:08.340 --> 01:50:09.940]   You can get power over Type C, by the way,
[01:50:09.940 --> 01:50:12.660]   and you can pass it through and use it as an interface,
[01:50:12.660 --> 01:50:15.460]   audio interface as well, which is kind of another reason
[01:50:15.460 --> 01:50:16.700]   to carry this around.
[01:50:16.700 --> 01:50:17.380]   It's pretty good.
[01:50:17.380 --> 01:50:17.900]   Absolutely.
[01:50:17.900 --> 01:50:20.540]   The only thing I like is you get the waveform on the LCD.
[01:50:20.540 --> 01:50:20.980]   It's your--
[01:50:20.980 --> 01:50:21.320]   Oh, really?
[01:50:21.320 --> 01:50:22.420]   That's great.
[01:50:22.420 --> 01:50:23.380]   That's awesome.
[01:50:23.380 --> 01:50:25.420]   So you can actually see if your--
[01:50:25.420 --> 01:50:26.620]   Zoom's come a long way.
[01:50:26.620 --> 01:50:29.100]   I mean, first, they started off rough
[01:50:29.100 --> 01:50:31.620]   and they have definitely been finding their way in product.
[01:50:31.620 --> 01:50:32.780]   They were consuming, right?
[01:50:32.780 --> 01:50:33.900]   What I really like about Zoom--
[01:50:33.900 --> 01:50:34.580]   I think, yeah.
[01:50:34.580 --> 01:50:37.940]   What I like about Zoom is that they're very creative.
[01:50:37.940 --> 01:50:39.940]   So they're willing to take a lot of risks.
[01:50:39.940 --> 01:50:42.340]   They have that eight channel one that looks like a spider.
[01:50:42.340 --> 01:50:44.620]   And you're kind of like, I don't understand that.
[01:50:44.620 --> 01:50:48.260]   But what I love about it was that they're not stuck in a--
[01:50:48.260 --> 01:50:49.860]   I'm just going to build a box.
[01:50:49.860 --> 01:50:52.420]   They're playing with all these ideas.
[01:50:52.420 --> 01:50:53.540]   So I think that it's good.
[01:50:53.540 --> 01:50:55.700]   I think that-- I have not seen that recorder.
[01:50:55.700 --> 01:50:57.660]   That one is tiny and really cool looking.
[01:50:57.660 --> 01:51:00.060]   So I think that it's--
[01:51:00.060 --> 01:51:01.580]   but 32-bit float is--
[01:51:01.580 --> 01:51:03.900]   I wouldn't, at this point, buy a field recorder that
[01:51:03.900 --> 01:51:08.460]   didn't have 32-bit float because it's already saved me
[01:51:08.460 --> 01:51:11.500]   at least three or four projects where the audio wasn't
[01:51:11.500 --> 01:51:12.340]   where we wanted it to be.
[01:51:12.340 --> 01:51:14.580]   And if we had done it any other way,
[01:51:14.580 --> 01:51:16.460]   because we're sending out remote kits
[01:51:16.460 --> 01:51:17.980]   that we're not controlling.
[01:51:17.980 --> 01:51:22.380]   And someone on the other end is not technically--
[01:51:22.380 --> 01:51:25.500]   there's no replacement for a great field
[01:51:25.500 --> 01:51:28.540]   recorder and field recordist that's going with it.
[01:51:28.540 --> 01:51:31.540]   But when you have to send it out, especially during COVID,
[01:51:31.540 --> 01:51:33.220]   we had to send all of these out.
[01:51:33.220 --> 01:51:35.740]   We have executives turning up their audio.
[01:51:35.740 --> 01:51:41.140]   Like, it's not a great environment for us or it wasn't.
[01:51:41.140 --> 01:51:44.460]   And the float in the mixed pres, which
[01:51:44.460 --> 01:51:47.340]   is what we were using, it saved us at least four or five times.
[01:51:47.340 --> 01:51:48.020]   I'm very happy.
[01:51:48.020 --> 01:51:49.260]   350 bucks.
[01:51:49.260 --> 01:51:52.580]   It's got the tripod mount on it.
[01:51:52.580 --> 01:51:53.740]   It's quarter, 20.
[01:51:53.740 --> 01:51:54.740]   It's a great--
[01:51:54.740 --> 01:51:56.420]   It's got-- I love these little bars
[01:51:56.420 --> 01:51:58.300]   because you could put it in a strap around your wrist.
[01:51:58.300 --> 01:51:59.900]   They have a picture of somebody.
[01:51:59.900 --> 01:52:00.900]   You could wear it on your belt.
[01:52:00.900 --> 01:52:03.660]   You could put it on your boom if you want.
[01:52:03.660 --> 01:52:06.020]   And it's been pretty robust.
[01:52:06.020 --> 01:52:07.340]   I've banged it around.
[01:52:07.340 --> 01:52:09.420]   It's got a headphone jack out.
[01:52:09.420 --> 01:52:10.060]   It's got line out.
[01:52:10.060 --> 01:52:10.740]   It's just looking cool.
[01:52:10.740 --> 01:52:11.820]   I've never-- is that cool?
[01:52:11.820 --> 01:52:12.300]   Is that huge?
[01:52:12.300 --> 01:52:14.700]   That might be the smallest recorder I've ever seen.
[01:52:14.700 --> 01:52:16.300]   You know, like, that does what it does?
[01:52:16.300 --> 01:52:17.540]   It's really interesting.
[01:52:17.540 --> 01:52:19.740]   And it can handle up to a terabyte SD card.
[01:52:19.740 --> 01:52:21.460]   I have, as I said, 256 gigs in here.
[01:52:21.460 --> 01:52:24.260]   And that's 99.99 hour card.
[01:52:24.260 --> 01:52:25.260]   That's funny.
[01:52:25.260 --> 01:52:26.740]   That's just because it can't go to the next one.
[01:52:26.740 --> 01:52:27.900]   Probably, I'd point out.
[01:52:27.900 --> 01:52:29.980]   That's probably can do more, but it just runs out.
[01:52:29.980 --> 01:52:31.060]   We've probably recorded a couple hours.
[01:52:31.060 --> 01:52:33.740]   And it's probably like-- it's probably
[01:52:33.740 --> 01:52:35.060]   recorded a couple hours.
[01:52:35.060 --> 01:52:36.100]   I recorded 100 hours.
[01:52:36.100 --> 01:52:37.860]   And it still says there's 99.99 hour.
[01:52:37.860 --> 01:52:39.300]   Exactly.
[01:52:39.300 --> 01:52:40.700]   That's a week of office hours, though.
[01:52:40.700 --> 01:52:41.420]   I mean, if we're honest.
[01:52:41.420 --> 01:52:41.940]   Yes.
[01:52:41.940 --> 01:52:42.460]   Let's be here.
[01:52:42.460 --> 01:52:44.500]   But I was thinking, when I go on the cruise,
[01:52:44.500 --> 01:52:46.220]   I might want to sit down with somebody at a table.
[01:52:46.220 --> 01:52:48.980]   So I have table stands, a microphone, cables.
[01:52:48.980 --> 01:52:50.740]   And then this little field recorder.
[01:52:50.740 --> 01:52:53.380]   And I thought this would be a handy thing to do.
[01:52:53.380 --> 01:52:54.580]   Just look.
[01:52:54.580 --> 01:52:55.580]   Isn't that fun?
[01:52:55.580 --> 01:52:57.300]   What's the model of that?
[01:52:57.300 --> 01:52:58.180]   This is the F3.
[01:52:58.180 --> 01:53:00.660]   They do make an F6, which also supports 32-bit,
[01:53:00.660 --> 01:53:02.180]   but has six inputs.
[01:53:02.180 --> 01:53:03.180]   I almost got that.
[01:53:03.180 --> 01:53:06.020]   It's a lot more expensive, obviously.
[01:53:06.020 --> 01:53:07.940]   Because I was kind of intrigued by the idea
[01:53:07.940 --> 01:53:11.500]   of doing a round table show like this on the cruise.
[01:53:11.500 --> 01:53:13.180]   But it's also-- it's 750 bucks.
[01:53:13.180 --> 01:53:14.540]   It's not much bigger.
[01:53:14.540 --> 01:53:19.780]   So here's a picture of the F6 sitting on a tripod head.
[01:53:19.780 --> 01:53:20.860]   John, if you can show that.
[01:53:20.860 --> 01:53:21.820]   Yeah.
[01:53:21.820 --> 01:53:23.620]   So it's not much bigger.
[01:53:23.620 --> 01:53:25.420]   And it's also 32-bit.
[01:53:25.420 --> 01:53:25.780]   So--
[01:53:25.780 --> 01:53:26.780]   Yeah.
[01:53:26.780 --> 01:53:29.180]   Zoom has been really pushing the envelope.
[01:53:29.180 --> 01:53:32.220]   Yeah, they've always been popular with podcasters,
[01:53:32.220 --> 01:53:35.100]   because it's an easy way to go out and do a field recorder.
[01:53:35.100 --> 01:53:39.220]   For years, as a radio reporter, I had a little taskam cassette
[01:53:39.220 --> 01:53:41.020]   recorder, and you'd have a microphone.
[01:53:41.020 --> 01:53:44.900]   So this is basically replacing that in a very small package
[01:53:44.900 --> 01:53:46.300]   with great quality, I think.
[01:53:46.300 --> 01:53:50.100]   And can I also say, one of the best things I heard you say
[01:53:50.100 --> 01:53:52.780]   about that is the fact that it has that LCD screen.
[01:53:52.780 --> 01:53:56.060]   Because this is the mixed pre-3.
[01:53:56.060 --> 01:53:59.180]   And one of the things that made me buy it apart
[01:53:59.180 --> 01:54:01.020]   from Alan's recommendation, which should have been enough,
[01:54:01.020 --> 01:54:03.180]   is this idea that it has this meter.
[01:54:03.180 --> 01:54:06.140]   So I can actually see what's--
[01:54:06.140 --> 01:54:07.860]   with the audio that it's seeing.
[01:54:07.860 --> 01:54:10.260]   And there's a big flashing light for recording
[01:54:10.260 --> 01:54:13.460]   the number of times where I've recorded an interview
[01:54:13.460 --> 01:54:14.260]   with somebody.
[01:54:14.260 --> 01:54:17.260]   And my mind can focus on the conversation,
[01:54:17.260 --> 01:54:18.780]   because out of the corner of my eye,
[01:54:18.780 --> 01:54:21.340]   I can see that, yes, the recorder is recording,
[01:54:21.340 --> 01:54:23.300]   and yes, it does see the audio.
[01:54:23.300 --> 01:54:26.300]   So yes, that's such a great feature, particularly
[01:54:26.300 --> 01:54:27.420]   the notes, unless it's expensive.
[01:54:27.420 --> 01:54:31.180]   I'll put this on my belt at CESA, and I can do this,
[01:54:31.180 --> 01:54:32.020]   and I'm recording.
[01:54:32.020 --> 01:54:33.860]   And yeah, I don't know if you can see it,
[01:54:33.860 --> 01:54:37.380]   but you can see there's a waveform there as I'm speaking.
[01:54:37.380 --> 01:54:38.740]   So you know exactly what's going on.
[01:54:38.740 --> 01:54:39.540]   It's two channels.
[01:54:39.540 --> 01:54:39.900]   So that's--
[01:54:39.900 --> 01:54:40.980]   - Elonapot, live from Twitter.
[01:54:40.980 --> 01:54:41.740]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:54:41.740 --> 01:54:43.620]   - Tell us about your doodads and your guess notes.
[01:54:43.620 --> 01:54:45.100]   (laughing)
[01:54:45.100 --> 01:54:46.380]   - I don't know why.
[01:54:46.380 --> 01:54:49.300]   It's something habitual that I have in me that,
[01:54:49.300 --> 01:54:51.100]   well, I gotta have an audio recorder.
[01:54:51.100 --> 01:54:52.460]   I don't know why, but--
[01:54:52.460 --> 01:54:53.460]   - You know what's cool radio?
[01:54:53.460 --> 01:54:54.300]   - It's not your video.
[01:54:54.300 --> 01:54:55.620]   - It's a soul radio guy, yeah.
[01:54:55.620 --> 01:54:56.620]   - Yeah.
[01:54:56.620 --> 01:54:59.580]   - I also love it because it used to be so much harder.
[01:54:59.580 --> 01:55:02.380]   And now it's so easy and so transparent,
[01:55:02.380 --> 01:55:03.380]   and I kind of love that.
[01:55:03.380 --> 01:55:04.220]   - And they've made huge--
[01:55:04.220 --> 01:55:04.940]   - When a knock on either carrying those
[01:55:04.940 --> 01:55:05.940]   real-to-reels around it.
[01:55:05.940 --> 01:55:07.100]   - Yeah, that was hard.
[01:55:07.100 --> 01:55:09.660]   - Oh no, I could, you know, I started collecting
[01:55:09.660 --> 01:55:11.380]   like tape recorders during the pandemic,
[01:55:11.380 --> 01:55:13.460]   as you know, because we all started doing weird things.
[01:55:13.460 --> 01:55:14.300]   - As when we were--
[01:55:14.300 --> 01:55:15.140]   - It's in stir-cracy.
[01:55:15.140 --> 01:55:17.860]   - Recorders are sourdough bread, you know, you get your choice.
[01:55:17.860 --> 01:55:18.700]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:55:18.700 --> 01:55:20.500]   - And my favorite ones in the collection
[01:55:20.500 --> 01:55:23.540]   are ones that were like actually used by like reporters.
[01:55:23.540 --> 01:55:27.180]   I have them, I have from WEI, like news radio in Boston,
[01:55:27.180 --> 01:55:29.820]   like their like boxy thing 'cause that tape
[01:55:29.820 --> 01:55:33.020]   with a WEI logo with a microphone attached.
[01:55:33.020 --> 01:55:35.860]   The most fun one was a very, very nice one.
[01:55:35.860 --> 01:55:38.260]   It looks like a very, very thick walkman,
[01:55:38.260 --> 01:55:39.420]   though, to precedes the walkman.
[01:55:39.420 --> 01:55:42.700]   The fun part is that it has a mount on the bottom,
[01:55:42.700 --> 01:55:44.740]   so you can attach a, I'm not joking,
[01:55:44.740 --> 01:55:47.020]   a pistol grip to it with a trigger
[01:55:47.020 --> 01:55:48.580]   that starts and stops recording.
[01:55:48.580 --> 01:55:50.580]   So like, so you're actually like walking up
[01:55:50.580 --> 01:55:52.940]   to a politician's city hall like this.
[01:55:52.940 --> 01:55:54.260]   - Yeah.
[01:55:54.260 --> 01:55:56.980]   - Like we call that the American report button.
[01:55:56.980 --> 01:56:00.140]   - Yeah, pistol grip not included here.
[01:56:00.140 --> 01:56:03.220]   Yeah, Zoom F3, 350 bucks, if you want more,
[01:56:03.220 --> 01:56:06.740]   you can get F6 for 750 bucks that has six inputs,
[01:56:06.740 --> 01:56:10.540]   which would be enough to do your podcast, that's for sure.
[01:56:10.540 --> 01:56:13.100]   - And they've come so long, they come so long.
[01:56:13.100 --> 01:56:15.100]   - Well, I like the idea I could provide my own mics.
[01:56:15.100 --> 01:56:17.180]   The old Zoom recorder said their own mics,
[01:56:17.180 --> 01:56:18.780]   which were fine, but I like the idea
[01:56:18.780 --> 01:56:21.020]   I can have that 758 or something else.
[01:56:21.020 --> 01:56:23.060]   I was thinking of getting that Neumann
[01:56:23.060 --> 01:56:25.140]   that you like so much, but then I don't want to carry
[01:56:25.140 --> 01:56:26.740]   that around, so the SM58.
[01:56:26.740 --> 01:56:28.020]   - It would be horrible on a ship though,
[01:56:28.020 --> 01:56:29.340]   because it's so sensitive.
[01:56:29.340 --> 01:56:31.860]   The SM58 is like the perfect mine for what you're doing.
[01:56:31.860 --> 01:56:33.580]   - Yeah, absolutely. - Yeah, absolutely stuff.
[01:56:33.580 --> 01:56:37.700]   Yeah, I got a couple of little table stands I can set up.
[01:56:37.700 --> 01:56:39.700]   (laughs)
[01:56:39.700 --> 01:56:41.300]   - I'm here, I'm running with my shell.
[01:56:41.300 --> 01:56:42.220]   - I'm running with good paper in it.
[01:56:42.220 --> 01:56:43.500]   - That's credentials.
[01:56:43.500 --> 01:56:45.780]   - I have a hat with press in it, yes, absolutely.
[01:56:45.780 --> 01:56:48.300]   - Nice. - Captain, captain, I need to know.
[01:56:48.300 --> 01:56:49.820]   Are we gonna hit an iceberg?
[01:56:49.820 --> 01:56:54.340]   That is it for Mac Break Weekly for this Tuesday.
[01:56:54.340 --> 01:56:56.820]   Thank you, Renee, Richie for coming back to us.
[01:56:56.820 --> 01:56:58.300]   You'll find Renee's-- - Thank you for being here.
[01:56:58.300 --> 01:57:02.660]   - All of Renee's stuff at youtube.com/ReneeRitchie,
[01:57:02.660 --> 01:57:05.460]   and you've just been cranking out stuff, I'm sure,
[01:57:05.460 --> 01:57:06.980]   all about all the new hardware,
[01:57:06.980 --> 01:57:09.660]   and you've got it, it looks like you've got everything.
[01:57:09.660 --> 01:57:10.980]   - All the reviews are live, yes.
[01:57:10.980 --> 01:57:15.260]   - Yeah, so there he is trying to weigh in his hands
[01:57:15.260 --> 01:57:17.060]   two different Mac studios.
[01:57:17.060 --> 01:57:20.380]   He's got the iPad Air 5, which he's now dropped on the floor,
[01:57:20.380 --> 01:57:23.900]   so the iPhone-- - I dropped the iPad Air 4, luckily.
[01:57:23.900 --> 01:57:25.460]   - Oh, that's all right then.
[01:57:25.460 --> 01:57:27.460]   And somebody in the chatroom saying,
[01:57:27.460 --> 01:57:30.780]   "Well, would you recommend the studio display
[01:57:30.780 --> 01:57:32.820]   "knowing even with the camera issue?"
[01:57:32.820 --> 01:57:35.220]   Apple says they're gonna fix it.
[01:57:35.220 --> 01:57:37.340]   - For Mac nerds who've wanted a 5K display
[01:57:37.340 --> 01:57:39.900]   and just didn't want anything to do with the 4K displays,
[01:57:39.900 --> 01:57:41.180]   you finally got what you've been asking for.
[01:57:41.180 --> 01:57:42.420]   If you haven't asked for it, then don't get it,
[01:57:42.420 --> 01:57:43.540]   get something else, you're fine.
[01:57:43.540 --> 01:57:44.980]   - I'm happy with 4K.
[01:57:44.980 --> 01:57:46.620]   - Why do you need 5K?
[01:57:46.620 --> 01:57:49.140]   - Every designer I know has gone gaga over this.
[01:57:49.140 --> 01:57:50.140]   They've been waiting five years.
[01:57:50.140 --> 01:57:51.660]   For anyone who makes a human interface
[01:57:51.660 --> 01:57:53.420]   or anything like that, they've been waiting for--
[01:57:53.420 --> 01:57:55.420]   - They know what they want, and this is what they want.
[01:57:55.420 --> 01:57:57.740]   So if you know you want it, get it.
[01:57:57.740 --> 01:58:01.380]   Thank you, Renee, Andy Inacault, WGBH in Boston,
[01:58:01.380 --> 01:58:03.500]   and also at the local library.
[01:58:04.940 --> 01:58:07.620]   - What are you gonna be on GVH next?
[01:58:07.620 --> 01:58:11.020]   - I'm off this week, but tune in next week, Friday at 12.30pm.
[01:58:11.020 --> 01:58:14.180]   Go to wgbhnews.org to listen to it live or later,
[01:58:14.180 --> 01:58:17.020]   or you can listen to last Friday show
[01:58:17.020 --> 01:58:19.260]   in which I talked a whole bunch about Apple stuff.
[01:58:19.260 --> 01:58:20.580]   - Oh, I bet you did.
[01:58:20.580 --> 01:58:22.460]   I bet you did.
[01:58:22.460 --> 01:58:25.380]   And of course from officehours.global
[01:58:25.380 --> 01:58:28.180]   and 090.media, Alex Lindsey,
[01:58:28.180 --> 01:58:30.940]   we watched the rocket go up this weekend.
[01:58:30.940 --> 01:58:31.780]   - Good, good. - Office hours,
[01:58:31.780 --> 01:58:33.100]   that was really cool.
[01:58:34.060 --> 01:58:36.220]   - Yeah, and this week we're actually breaking down
[01:58:36.220 --> 01:58:37.060]   how we did it.
[01:58:37.060 --> 01:58:38.500]   So tomorrow morning we're gonna talk about the graphics,
[01:58:38.500 --> 01:58:40.700]   so the graphics crew will talk about it,
[01:58:40.700 --> 01:58:42.500]   'cause they were taking real time telemetry
[01:58:42.500 --> 01:58:44.460]   from the rocket and putting it into the graphics.
[01:58:44.460 --> 01:58:45.380]   - It was so cool. - And so cool.
[01:58:45.380 --> 01:58:46.780]   - I loved it.
[01:58:46.780 --> 01:58:49.820]   - And so we'll be talking about that a little bit.
[01:58:49.820 --> 01:58:51.700]   The next day we're talking about the actual production,
[01:58:51.700 --> 01:58:52.860]   'cause there was quite a production there.
[01:58:52.860 --> 01:58:55.060]   There was, I don't know, eight or 10 cameras,
[01:58:55.060 --> 01:58:56.660]   and we were doing live,
[01:58:56.660 --> 01:58:59.020]   they were literally live back and forths with Australia,
[01:58:59.020 --> 01:59:01.060]   and there was a lot of things,
[01:59:01.060 --> 01:59:03.620]   and this is all just like people have good fun weekend.
[01:59:03.620 --> 01:59:07.620]   - You know, and so anyway, I was just totally absurd.
[01:59:07.620 --> 01:59:10.300]   - Again, I mean, that's what's really interesting
[01:59:10.300 --> 01:59:11.780]   about this world, is this stuff,
[01:59:11.780 --> 01:59:15.100]   they used to have a truck to do.
[01:59:15.100 --> 01:59:16.500]   Suddenly you can do things.
[01:59:16.500 --> 01:59:19.260]   - And we had a truck. - We had a Tesla.
[01:59:19.260 --> 01:59:22.500]   - Ah, Tesla with a lot of power, yeah.
[01:59:22.500 --> 01:59:23.860]   So Jeff Keithley, who's got it,
[01:59:23.860 --> 01:59:24.980]   he does a lot of sports,
[01:59:24.980 --> 01:59:27.260]   and a lot of different productions brought his Tesla,
[01:59:27.260 --> 01:59:29.860]   it's a full production unit inside the Tesla,
[01:59:29.860 --> 01:59:31.620]   so he-- - Was he powering it
[01:59:31.620 --> 01:59:33.380]   with a Tesla's battery?
[01:59:33.380 --> 01:59:34.220]   - Ah, we had a generator.
[01:59:34.220 --> 01:59:35.060]   - Oh yeah, yeah.
[01:59:35.060 --> 01:59:36.720]   - So it's hard to get an all- - You gotta get an all-
[01:59:36.720 --> 01:59:38.420]   - You're on the desert and stuff, yeah.
[01:59:38.420 --> 01:59:41.140]   - Like this is out in the middle of nowhere in Nevada,
[01:59:41.140 --> 01:59:44.140]   so it's, but we're already planning the next one.
[01:59:44.140 --> 01:59:45.900]   Like it was like, we finished, we were like,
[01:59:45.900 --> 01:59:47.820]   that was great, we did a great job,
[01:59:47.820 --> 01:59:49.780]   let's, now what are we gonna do different for the next one,
[01:59:49.780 --> 01:59:51.540]   so it's already-- - You need a model
[01:59:51.540 --> 01:59:54.260]   of the rocket so that you can take it apart
[01:59:54.260 --> 01:59:56.340]   and show that, just like Walter Cronkite did,
[01:59:56.340 --> 01:59:58.020]   show the pre- - Yeah, AR.
[01:59:58.020 --> 01:59:59.380]   - AR, do it AR, that's right.
[01:59:59.380 --> 02:00:00.620]   - Yeah, exactly, so we're--
[02:00:00.620 --> 02:00:03.180]   090.media if you wanna hire Alex,
[02:00:03.180 --> 02:00:05.260]   officehours.global if you wanna see
[02:00:05.260 --> 02:00:10.260]   the most amazing three-ring circus of geeks ever, 24/7.
[02:00:10.260 --> 02:00:13.500]   - Thank you Renee, thank you Alex, thank you Andy,
[02:00:13.500 --> 02:00:16.060]   great to have you all, thank you all for being here.
[02:00:16.060 --> 02:00:17.540]   Thanks to our club, Twit members,
[02:00:17.540 --> 02:00:20.140]   who make all of this possible, $7 a month,
[02:00:20.140 --> 02:00:23.820]   gets you ad-free versions of all of our shows,
[02:00:23.820 --> 02:00:26.580]   becoming increasingly important as advertisers
[02:00:26.580 --> 02:00:29.540]   are pushing harder and harder for ad tracking technology,
[02:00:29.540 --> 02:00:30.540]   and we're pushing against 'em,
[02:00:30.540 --> 02:00:33.060]   but boy, if we have a big enough club Twit,
[02:00:33.060 --> 02:00:35.740]   we don't have to worry about that anymore.
[02:00:35.740 --> 02:00:37.700]   If you don't want trackers, you don't want ads,
[02:00:37.700 --> 02:00:41.540]   $7 a month, you also get access to the club Twit Discord,
[02:00:41.540 --> 02:00:45.620]   which is great fun, really a wonderful place to hang out.

[02:00:48.620 --> 02:00:52.980]   actually it's 24/7, but it was most active during the show,
[02:00:52.980 --> 02:00:56.100]   but there's also sections on every possible subject,

[02:01:08.140 --> 02:01:09.260]   which has all sorts of stuff,
[02:01:09.260 --> 02:01:11.660]   including the special fireside chat
[02:01:11.660 --> 02:01:14.500]   with Patrick Delahanty, we did last week.
[02:01:14.500 --> 02:01:16.780]   That was really cool, our engineer,
[02:01:16.780 --> 02:01:20.020]   our official engineer, software engineer.
[02:01:20.020 --> 02:01:22.820]   You also will be hearing Stacey's book club this week

[02:01:25.540 --> 02:01:27.980]   the Gizfiz, lots of other shows that are club twitted only.
[02:01:27.980 --> 02:01:30.620]   All of that for $7 a month, how do we do it?
[02:01:30.620 --> 02:01:34.020]   I don't know, go to twit.tv/clubtwit,
[02:01:34.020 --> 02:01:35.700]   and you can participate.

[02:01:49.580 --> 02:01:53.420]   I had to adjust that 'cause we're on summertime now, 1,800 UTC.
[02:01:53.420 --> 02:01:56.060]   The chatroom is live at irc.twit.tv,
[02:01:56.060 --> 02:01:57.580]   as well as the Discord.
[02:01:57.580 --> 02:02:02.380]   After the fact, get shows from our website, twit.tv/mbw.
[02:02:02.380 --> 02:02:03.660]   You'll find a YouTube channel

[02:02:24.620 --> 02:02:27.180]   Thank you, everybody, for being here.
[02:02:27.180 --> 02:02:29.020]   Now, get back to work.

[02:02:33.300 --> 02:02:36.220]   Did you spend a lot of money on your brand new smartphone
[02:02:36.220 --> 02:02:39.260]   and then you look at the pictures on Facebook and Instagram
[02:02:39.260 --> 02:02:43.860]   and you're like, what in the world happened to that photo?
[02:02:43.860 --> 02:02:45.860]   Yes, you have, I know.
[02:02:45.860 --> 02:02:47.220]   It happens to all of us.
