[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the show.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   Today, a fun panel. Andy Inaco is back.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   We're glad to have you back, Andy.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   We were watching while we were doing the show last week
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   and keeping an eye on your Twitter to see how your mom was doing.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   Yeah, and thanks everybody.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   I didn't know that you guys were going to be mentioning that on the air.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   I got a lot of really nice emails from people.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   It makes the world become a much less lonely place,
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   even when total strangers are saying that they're in your corner.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   So I definitely appreciate all that.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   Yeah, well, I hope I didn't violate your confidentiality.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   I apologize.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   I think you were twittering about it, which is...
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   You know, I mean, save me from having to look up mom's social security number.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   I just looked on the...
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   [laughter]
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   Had to have that change pretty damn quickly,
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   because she downloads four properties in Manoa.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   Yeah, we probably shouldn't have gotten that out, I guess.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Well, you know, because there's a good sign and a bad sign to everything.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   So your intentions were good.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   I have to learn my limits, though, you know, boundaries.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   Also here, we haven't talked to him in a long time.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   We're really glad to have him back.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Brett Larson.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Hey!
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   From Channel 5, Channel 5, Channel 2.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   I can never remember.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   I'm at Channel 5 now in New York.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   You'll occasionally see me on Fox News Channel.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   He is the Mac Daddy.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   And all this season, this holiday season,
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   be watching me on four rather high tech toys for the holidays,
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   this syndicated show.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Oh, good.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Very exciting.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   Wait, wait, that's on four?
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   No, it's syndicated, so I don't know who it's on.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   It could be anywhere.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   It could be anywhere.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   It could be anywhere.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   Here in New York, it aired on Channel 5 last weekend.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Oh, cool.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   That's all I know.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   [laughter]
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   And also here with us Chris Breen,
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   he really is the Mac Daddy from the Mac 911 column in Mac
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Roll Magazine, and you hear him on the iPhone,
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   or pardon me, the Apple phone show.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Hey, Leo.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   How you doing, Chris?
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   I'm doing well.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   You all have a good Thanksgiving?
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   I did.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   As I mentioned last week, I was at Mom's.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   I brought down an iMac 4.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   We got it set up.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   I've got her using iChat now, and, you know,
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   except she has to do her hair now before she sits in front of the computer.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   [laughter]
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   You got to buy her a Kindle?
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   I don't think so.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   I don't think so.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   You know, do they--
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Yeah, I guess you can.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   I don't think you're falling from a great height by some sort of things born,
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   or Dr. Villain.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Yeah, I was kind of weighing, you know, the pros and cons of it.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   You know, she's used to her old Panasonic answering machine,
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   so she'll feel right at home with a form factor,
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   but I'm not so sure about the Pixel for Books idea.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Well, Annie and Ico has one.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   And judging from your Twitter, Sandy, you like it.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   I love it.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   I didn't think that there would be anything to challenge the iPhone
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   as the coolest and neatest and most transforming thing,
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   consumer technology to come out in 2007, but damn,
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   the Kindle just really knocked one out of the park.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   And not for the reasons that you would think.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   If you're not excited about the idea of a $400 thing
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   that lets you go out to Amazon and buy $10 and $15 things,
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   I'm right with you.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   But what Amazon did-- here's how I explain it.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   What Amazon did is they designed and built a humanoid Android robot
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   capable of autonomous action that can use any tool or vehicle
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   designed for use by humans.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   When can I get that?
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   Well, no, no, no, stick with me here.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   I'm building a word picture.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   If you want to do-- you do like environmental, like BBC,
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   radio theater-- that's fine too.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   OK, I'm imagining that.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   OK.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   So every morning at 4 a.m., though, the robot gets in your car
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   and drives to like four or five different farmers' markets,
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   buying the freshest, most wonderful ingredients,
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   then it gets home back about a half hour before you wake up,
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   mixes up the waffle batter.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   And by the time you walk into the kitchen, there is a plate
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   of the most wonderful, freshly produced waffles made from scratch
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   with farm fresh strawberries and cream right from the farm
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   that morning.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   It's the most incredible invention ever.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   And Amazon, because they're brilliant marketers,
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   is marketing and advertising this as a $400 waffle maker.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   That's my opinion of the Kindle.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   It's the most incredible thing, but they're selling it
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   as a $400 thing for buying more $10 and $15 things.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   What people have to know is that it comes-- this is one of those
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   bits of information that I had to double and triple check.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   I was reading up about it before it actually arrived.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   And I did not believe this because it's just so stupidly good.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   It comes with a free 3G-level internet connection
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   on the Sprint phone network.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   The same Sprint internet network you have with a Sprint phone.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   You have on this device.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   You also have a web browser built into the device.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   Now, it's not as good as Safari, not even as good as Safari on iPhone,
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   but it's as good as Windows Mobile Explorer.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   It's a very good mobile-type web browser.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   It runs Google Reader and Blog Lines just fine.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   And now here's the kicker.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   The internet service is free.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   You do not pay for it.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   So when you think about this as a very large,
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   very readable tablet device that makes it very, very easy to read lots of text,
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   if all it did is give you free unlimited access to Google Reader or Blog Lines,
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   whatever you're using to manage your RSS feeds and manage your blogs,
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   just for that, for a lot of people, myself included, it's going to be worth $399.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   And there's a lot of other things that gives it incredible showmanship points.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   But it was kind of funny.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   I was in New York over the weekend doing another thing for CBS.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   And this is like the Kindle just arrived a couple days earlier,
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   so this was the really good test for it.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   And so I was in Midtown, New York with a friend of mine.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   We wanted to go buy some comics.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   My usual place for buying comics is Midtown Comics on 7th Avenue and 40th.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   And my friend who's a local says, "Gee, I think they opened like a new store.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   We're up on like 58th, 59th Street.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   Gee, I think they opened a store like Uptown that might be closer."
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   And so I actually decided to do a head-to-head challenge between the iPhones
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   built-in map program and this feature that's built into the Kindle called Kindle Now Now.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   It's, I believe it's actually a connection to Amazon's mechanical Turk service,
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   where you type in a question and that it shows up on this other website in the Amazon
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   universe where actual humans get paid to answer questions correctly.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   So instead of doing a web search for Midtown Comics, NYC locations,
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   you simply type on the little, in 255 characters or less, you type in plain,
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   just as I'm saying right now, Midtown Comics opened a new Uptown location sometime
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   in the past couple of years question, then click Send.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   Then I got my iPhone out of my pocket, woke it up, launched the map application.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   Now I realized that I was a little bit hamstrung by the fact that I think that there was one
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   really bad piece of design in the iPhone and that's the way you switch between the map
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   application when you're switching between here's an address, please, here's a business
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   name, please locate it on a map and the mode where you're saying, please give me directions
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   between one place and another.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   I think they weren't a lot really way too clever because if I'm in the direction mode,
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   it always takes me like a full 30 seconds to a minute to figure out how to get back to the,
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   please tell me where Midtown Comics is in New York mode.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   But by the time I pulled up that information and got those two little pinpoints on the map,
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   showing me the name of the second location, I checked the screen of my Kindle,
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   looked at my library of books and I found a brand new book had been delivered, written
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   by the, someone said, yes, there's a second location on something and something complete
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   with a complete list of all Midtown Comics locations, subway directions to get there,
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   driving directions to get there, a link to the website.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   And I have to declare it a push where if I didn't have, if I were not so clumsy with the map
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   app, it certainly would have been the iPhone hands down.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   But the Kindle got it within a minute, I would say, being fair on all things.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   And it gave me much more information.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   And again, it was free and it was a real human giving me advice.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   I was asking questions.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   Is that askville or you said it's the Turk?
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   I'm trying to find out.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   I thought it was askville and I was told earlier on that it was askville,
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   but someone corrected me and said that it was actually a mechanical Turk.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   Not only you have to pay the mechanical Turk to do that kind of thing.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   So don't pay, don't pay for nothing.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   The only thing you pay for outside, the only part of the usage of the Kindle that you pay
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   for outside of buying books and buying newspapers is it costs you a dime every time you use the
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   email conduit to put one of your own documents on the device.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   That's another really cool thing about it.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   You never have to connect this to your Mac or your PC via a USB cable and it will appear as a
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   standard USB mass storage device.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   You can put any compatible file on there and it will appear in the library and it will be read.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   But it also has its own unique email address so that any time you find yourself with a
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   compatible document that you'd like to have available on your Kindle.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   If you go, that's me.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   Sorry.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   Your phone doesn't like the Kindle.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   I answered my Taco Bell.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   I have to correct this call a moment.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   Okay.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   Keep talking.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   Anyway.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.600]   So the point is that anytime you've got a document or desktop or anywhere in the world that you
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:22.960]   think you'd like to have handy like there's an HTML file on HTML version of a book up
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:26.000]   on the Project Gutenberg project or Word file you've got that you're working on.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   You can just email it to your Kindle and it will show up in about five minutes.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   That cost 10 cents.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   Each one of those, each time you do that it costs 10 cents.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   Does it convert the PDF to Moby format in that process?
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   Yes and no.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.960]   The cool thing about the email conduit is that if it's in a format that the Kindle
[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:47.960]   doesn't immediately and directly open it will convert it automatically.
[00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:52.080]   PDF is labeled as an experimentally supported format.
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:56.320]   So I've had plenty of PDF documents that have converted correctly.
[00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:01.680]   I don't really have it not yet but I'm writing an automated action that will simply have
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:07.280]   a print to Kindle so to speak, a plugin for the print dialogue.
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:11.840]   But for all my travel stuff, my hotel reservation, my Amtrak reservation, I just simply printed
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:16.400]   it as a PDF and then emailed it to the Kindle and all those converted just fine.
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:18.880]   A whole bunch of manuals converted just fine.
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:21.440]   A whole bunch of stuff though didn't convert just fine.
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:25.840]   I wanted to see how well it works as a comic book reader and DC Comics.
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:27.400]   Of course you did.
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:28.400]   Of course you did.
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:32.200]   Well, it's a slab that you can then read stuff on.
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:36.440]   So what you're really saying is that think of this not as a book reader but as a kind
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:39.440]   of free wireless internet device.
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:41.320]   That's the usage number one for it.
[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:43.240]   Really I'm trying to find the way.
[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:44.240]   That's interesting.
[00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:48.720]   When I'm writing my review, I'm trying to find a really sophisticated and elegant way
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:54.120]   of simply saying it's a device for reading something that is in digital format.
[00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:56.640]   That thing can be a document that originated on your desktop.
[00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:01.240]   That thing can be a DRM book that you bought off the Amazon store or it can be a web blog
[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:03.840]   or a website that's out there on the internet.
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:09.040]   Because again, if this were just, if Google simply said, look, 399 bucks, we will give
[00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:14.200]   you this tablet that will last at least two or three days on wireless that you can read
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:17.200]   all your blogs on and you never have to pay for internet access charges.
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:19.400]   You never have to find a Wi-Fi hotspot.
[00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:23.280]   That would be actually for me, someone who spends hours every day keeping up with the
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:26.580]   news and also keeping up with my friends via RSS feeds.
[00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:28.480]   That would be worth $399 worth.
[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:33.120]   This is really a very, it's a very iPod like thing for text.
[00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:34.120]   Interesting.
[00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:38.480]   Now of course that would rely on Amazon continuing to offer all these services for free.
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:44.400]   You do have to find the web browser and I understand it in the, it's not right away
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:45.400]   available.
[00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:47.400]   You have to turn on some debug feature or something, don't you?
[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:48.400]   No, you don't.
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:51.800]   What there is, when you first turn it on, I've got it right in front of you.
[00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:58.360]   What you first see is, if you hit the homepage rather, what you see is essentially a list
[00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:02.040]   of the books and the titles that are inside your library.
[00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:07.720]   However, at the very, very bottom of the screen, I would have this one dimensional mouse because
[00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:11.000]   the display is not fast enough to have an actual user interface on it.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.520]   There's actually a second fast LCD on the side of it that gives you a pointer that you
[00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:16.840]   can then navigate up and down and then click on.
[00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:21.600]   If you go to the menu at the very, very bottom, there's shop in the Kindle store, check for
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:24.000]   new items, settings, your content manager.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.720]   At the bottom, there's a mysterious menu called experimental, which has the cool stuff.
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:32.120]   It has a web browser called BasicWeb.
[00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:39.400]   It has that Ask Kindle now, now that mechanical Turk or AskVille conduit and also has a MP3
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:41.200]   player built into it.
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:43.560]   And it supports audible.com, by the way.
[00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:44.560]   And it supports audible.com.
[00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:49.000]   You can't download them directly, but that's the one instance in which you definitely would
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.040]   have to connect it via USB or you copied onto an SD card and put it into the SD slot that's
[00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:56.360]   inside this, that's buried inside this thing.
[00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:57.880]   It won't download them directly.
[00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:59.360]   Now you're going to kill your battery life.
[00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:02.040]   Well, I guess the battery life is not great anyway because of all the wireless unless
[00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:03.040]   you turn off the wireless.
[00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:04.840]   The battery life is pretty good.
[00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:06.640]   I did not bring the charger.
[00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:07.640]   I did not bring it.
[00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:10.520]   It will charge off USB, but I didn't even attempt to charge it.
[00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:16.520]   And it did last a full two day trip where I was a, it was three and a half, four hours
[00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:18.240]   Amtrak from Boston to New York.
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:20.640]   It was three and a half, four hours in New York to Boston.
[00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:24.160]   And then I was doing nothing but reading blogs.
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:25.160]   Wow.
[00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:28.000]   I was getting three or four bars steadily from start to finish.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   I never get that.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   That's the iPhone.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.480]   And after like about, I'd say about six hours of reading, that's when the battery, low battery
[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:36.480]   warning came up.
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:37.920]   And even then I could still read documents.
[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:39.720]   I just couldn't keep the wireless open.
[00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:40.720]   That's the other thing.
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:44.560]   I think Amazon is kind of downselling this capability.
[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:46.960]   They don't really, you know, you have to find it.
[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:49.920]   They imply that you have to pay two bucks a month for blogs.
[00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:50.920]   Yeah.
[00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:51.920]   And that's really silly.
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:56.960]   Now the thing that I'm concerned about and I still don't, I have, I have some questions
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:00.960]   into, to Amazon that I hope to get answered.
[00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:05.400]   One of them is does experimental mean you could take it back at any time.
[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:11.880]   Also, I know that it is based on a flavor of Linux in there, but do it, it makes so far
[00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:16.240]   I'm working under the assumption that Amazon essentially owns this device.
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:20.120]   So that one day you can turn it on, you find out that because of this wireless connection
[00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:25.160]   is on 24/7, at some point they've pushed out an update that removes PDF support or removes
[00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:26.680]   the web browser.
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:31.560]   But I don't, I hope they won't do that because that's what makes this into a really exciting
[00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:33.200]   and viable product.
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:37.600]   If again, I'm not a big fan of devices that, I'm not a big fan of companies that want
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:42.880]   me to give them hundreds of dollars just as an entrance fee to allow me to pay more hundreds
[00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:43.880]   of dollars in the future.
[00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:48.000]   And, which was my initial reaction to this is this is Amazon's business model and that's
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   something I want.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.960]   But yeah, clearly you found it's more than that.
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:52.960]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:59.400]   And I mean, I bought PG White House novel and I bought Macaulay's 1776 book and they're
[00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:02.040]   both great and you can read them and they're quite nice.
[00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:06.720]   I would say that the reading experience is about equal to an iPhone, not really better
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:09.240]   than that, but it's pretty good.
[00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:15.600]   But again, I don't think that there are, I think that this is what makes it worth $399.
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:20.280]   This is the same position that people were in in 2001 when they bought the $399 first
[00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:21.280]   iPod.
[00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:25.240]   It's like, my God, that means I just have a box that can use for music that will play
[00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:27.840]   anything that I've tossed in there.
[00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:29.600]   This is the same sort of thing for text.
[00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:34.000]   You're going to see a lot of lame iPod analogies and I'm sure when my review hits the SunTimes
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.120]   on Thursday, we'll be adding two, three and four to that list.
[00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:42.000]   But there are a lot of, I think there are a lot of people who as soon as they know that
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   this is going to be their access point to again, blog lines or reader, that's what's
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.600]   going to get them to find a friend who has one and see how well it actually works.
[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:56.720]   Again, I was doubtful a week before I got my hands on it before I knew that there was
[00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:58.520]   this internet connection.
[00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:03.360]   But as soon as I've looked at so many of these products, I was really tensing for the moment
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:06.880]   where there was a message saying, "I'm sorry, you're not allowed to use the web browser
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:08.400]   to access the actual web."
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:14.880]   However, you can access the Starbucks website, the Amazon website, the Buy.com website.
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:16.840]   But no, it's just a web browser.
[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:18.520]   They didn't screw that up.
[00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:19.920]   They can still screw it up in the future.
[00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:24.360]   But for now, again, this is a really cool, really exciting device.
[00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:26.880]   I have to say, it was based on your Twitter's alone.
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:29.640]   I actually ordered one just because I thought, "Well, maybe there is more to this if Andy
[00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:30.640]   thinks it's good."
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:31.840]   Brad, have you played with it one yet?
[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:32.840]   Have you seen it?
[00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:33.840]   I have it.
[00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:36.520]   I was trying to get them to send me one when I got the release on it.
[00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:39.320]   They haven't sent out too many, I don't think, for review.
[00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:42.200]   Did you buy yours any or is it a review unit?
[00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:43.680]   It is a review unit.
[00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:44.680]   He's got Paul.
[00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:50.640]   Well, no, see, it's devices like these really show with digital clarity where I am on the
[00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:51.640]   pecking order.
[00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:53.000]   I'm not Stephen Levy.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.120]   I'm not Mr. Wossmossberg.
[00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:57.440]   I do not get these things to a month in advance.
[00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:59.640]   But I get them the day they're released.
[00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:00.640]   That's pretty good.
[00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:01.640]   Better than the rest of it.
[00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:04.000]   Chris, you didn't get one in the mail, did you?
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.560]   No, I didn't get one in the mail.
[00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:09.520]   I was looking for reliable sources for information on it.
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:13.800]   Andy has convinced me now that I actually have to lay hands on this because prior to
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:18.120]   that I'd seen some reviews and I thought the sources were a little questionable.
[00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:21.960]   The fact that Andy, this excited about it, encourages me.
[00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:22.960]   Yes, I trust me.
[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:23.960]   But he's not one being out.
[00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:27.760]   Andy is wearing his blue beanie, by the way.
[00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:34.480]   Well, I've decided to embrace the concept of Web Standards Compliance Day by leaving my
[00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:36.160]   icon and Twitter unchanged.
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:40.560]   I am wearing my usual brown fedora because I believe that I'm honoring the day by being
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:44.720]   as compliant with this standard as anyone else is with any other Web Standard.
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:45.720]   I'm wearing a blue beanie.
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:48.400]   Are you wearing a blue beanie at Chris Breen?
[00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:51.920]   No, because you know, they doesn't fit well with the headphones.
[00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:53.440]   So I've taken it off briefly.
[00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:54.440]   Yeah, but I do.
[00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:57.320]   I do want to have it on a likeness of my hair.
[00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:58.880]   The Buffont of Knowledge.
[00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:02.480]   Yes, it's sitting atop the spare Buffont of Knowledge.
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:04.280]   And it looks wonderful, fabulous, really.
[00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:05.680]   Do you know what this is all about, Brett Larson?
[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:06.680]   The blue beanie thing.
[00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:08.240]   Have you been following this?
[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:09.240]   I have not.
[00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:10.240]   I hate to say.
[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:11.720]   I knew you weren't wearing a blue beanie.
[00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:12.720]   I could tell.
[00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:14.840]   Yeah, I don't do hats.
[00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:15.840]   I should not.
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:18.000]   No, because you've got that fine hair.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.360]   You don't want to cover it up.
[00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:20.920]   That's so much time on.
[00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:23.120]   What is this?
[00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:26.080]   It's some sort of Web compliance day.
[00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:27.080]   It was actually yesterday.
[00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:29.240]   We missed the or day before it was Sunday.
[00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:33.120]   Missed the blue beanie thing, but I know as people are still wearing their blue beanies.
[00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:34.120]   Uh huh.
[00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:38.880]   It's said anything like Cyber Monday or whatever that.
[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:43.320]   Oh, this, yeah, we're recording this the day before the show goes out on Monday.
[00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:45.320]   This is Cyber Monday.
[00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:46.320]   Yeah.
[00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:47.720]   But that doesn't apply anymore, does it?
[00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:49.320]   Because everybody has high speed at home.
[00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:51.280]   Yeah, I don't think anybody cares.
[00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:55.000]   No, nobody goes out and buys stuff on today.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:00.880]   Well it's a weird concept where it was a marketing idea that was used to try to get
[00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:02.840]   people to the online shop.
[00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:03.840]   I'm certain of that.
[00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:06.240]   It's the easy way to get a press release that you've got two and a half minutes to fill
[00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:07.240]   at the end of the newscast.
[00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:08.240]   You're going to use it.
[00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:09.240]   It's actually, it's actually.
[00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:11.240]   Thanks when I vote a confidence Andy.
[00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:13.280]   No, no, I'm sorry.
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:16.600]   I've got one toe in the electronic teat myself.
[00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:18.480]   So far I'm just getting free hard boiled eggs from these three.
[00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:22.080]   I find the teats work better if you don't use your toes, but that's just me.
[00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:23.080]   I don't know.
[00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:24.080]   Yeah.
[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:25.080]   No, there's that.
[00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:26.080]   I read a book.
[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:30.840]   Anyway, uh, but the cool thing is that now that I think there's some sort of psychological
[00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:34.040]   or marketing, uh, principle is being demonstrated here.
[00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:38.320]   The fact that everybody thinks that it's true means that it becomes true, that now you
[00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:43.280]   can actually find good deals on Monday online, uh, because people think that there is this
[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:45.120]   thing called cyber Monday.
[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:46.760]   And so people are going to start looking on store.
[00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:47.760]   So it's not as a good.
[00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:50.080]   So also helps you get a deal on the Buffy box set.
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:51.080]   Hey, I don't care.
[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:55.760]   But there was several emails that went out today that were, you know, deal for cyber
[00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:56.760]   Monday.
[00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:57.760]   Yeah.
[00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:58.760]   Blah, blah, blah.
[00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:00.000]   I'm looking at one I got from g- the gadget locker.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.960]   It has a, uh, cyber Monday, uh, program.
[00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:07.360]   This kind of pricing on all products carried throughout the hot, well, it started today,
[00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:08.320]   but it's throughout the season.
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:10.440]   So what's the big deal there?
[00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:12.480]   Um, that's the gadget locker.com.
[00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:14.840]   You know, there's not a lot of Mac news.
[00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:19.680]   In fact, the only Mac news I see here, uh, I guess the biggest story anyway of the week
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:21.720]   is this, this burst settlement.
[00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:29.320]   Uh, burst was a, you see this burst is a company that had a some sort of high speed,
[00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:31.200]   uh, delivery.
[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:36.240]   I remember interviewing them, uh, uh, many years ago on the screen savers, the idea was
[00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:38.280]   very, very high speed broadband.
[00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:42.960]   They sued Apple over patent claims involving quote, the delivery of music or video over
[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:45.120]   the internet faster than real time.
[00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:47.720]   They patented that.
[00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:53.040]   Did you know that, uh, must have been a good patent because they, because they, they settled
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:54.640]   Apple settled for $10 million.
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:55.640]   Uh, wow.
[00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:56.640]   Yeah.
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:00.720]   They're going to pay them a one time license fee for their patent portfolio.
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:04.480]   It has, uh, other patents, including a three penning DVR patents.
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:10.240]   Um, but, but the press release says burst will not sue Apple over the DVR patents.
[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:13.920]   So I guess in the, with, with the 10 million burst gets a,
[00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:16.480]   they're the walk away gives Apple some sort of immunity.
[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:17.800]   Yeah.
[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:20.160]   That's the only story and it's not even, you know, like,
[00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:26.160]   I don't know what, is there anything else that happened this week?
[00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:27.800]   Anybody wants to talk about?
[00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:28.800]   Come on.
[00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:30.560]   Uh, Hey, I have a question.
[00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:32.240]   I, I, I got some Apple news.
[00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:37.120]   I, I totally walked right past Kelsey grammar in front of the Apple store in fifth avenue.
[00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:37.640]   Ooh.
[00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:38.640]   Was he in there?
[00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:39.640]   He was walking.
[00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:40.880]   Well, no, he's walking past.
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:42.200]   And I was also walking past.
[00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:43.440]   He was just walking by.
[00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:44.280]   I got a bone.
[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:45.680]   I got a bonafide glimpse at him.
[00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:47.680]   Uh, and he looked good.
[00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:48.200]   Well, tan.
[00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:48.720]   He was happy.
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:49.760]   He was with his wife and his kid.
[00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:53.920]   Uh, uh, clearly he was too odd by my presence to, you know, say, Hey, Andy.
[00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:57.120]   Hey, it might have been the blue, it might have been the non blue beanie.
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:58.640]   Yeah.
[00:22:58.640 --> 00:22:58.640]   Yeah.
[00:22:58.640 --> 00:22:59.640]   Good.
[00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:00.640]   Good.
[00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:03.880]   This was the day in 1993, Apple finally discontinued.
[00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:05.160]   This is actually a very sad day.
[00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:06.280]   Discontinued the Apple to.
[00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:11.840]   And the line, uh, they had a, uh, an event.
[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:15.400]   I remember very well when I first moved to San Francisco about eight years earlier that
[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:17.000]   said Apple to forever.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.800]   I remember that.
[00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:19.400]   Remember that.
[00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:21.560]   That's exactly how long forever is.
[00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:25.360]   So now no next time your girlfriend tells you I would love you forever.
[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:26.360]   It's eight years.
[00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:26.360]   Yeah.
[00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:27.360]   It's eight years.
[00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:28.360]   Okay.
[00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:30.360]   And you can start leaving the mountains have tumbled into the sea.
[00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:31.360]   Uh, yeah.
[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:33.960]   The stars have indeed fallen from the sky.
[00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:37.040]   Exactly eight years later.
[00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:38.640]   Uh, it's kind of sad.
[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:39.920]   I mean, that's the one was designed.
[00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:42.560]   You know, I should try to get, I see was is on Skype.
[00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:46.200]   Let me just send him a note and see if he wants to come on and say anything about that.
[00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:48.400]   He's been a little bitter lately, it seems.
[00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:49.480]   Really?
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:56.440]   Um, well, have you seen the kind of comments he said, uh, about jobs?
[00:23:56.440 --> 00:24:00.360]   You know, there was a picture and probably was in Valley Wag of an autograph.
[00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:04.800]   He gave somebody in the fake Steve Jobs book was signed.
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:07.040]   I liked this Steve better than the real one.
[00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:11.440]   Oh, well, you know, he loves to have fun.
[00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:12.760]   He likes to make jokes.
[00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:15.880]   That's a really funny thing to write in somebody's book.
[00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:17.400]   Mm hmm.
[00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:18.440]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:19.840]   He may, it may not be anything.
[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:26.400]   That's still, or we could we could we could become like the TMZ.com.
[00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:29.320]   Of like the of the tech podcasts.
[00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:32.640]   I was just like, I just gird on everybody.
[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:37.120]   And what industry founder was seeing dishing against his former partner to
[00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:38.520]   and the next time to hear all about it.
[00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:39.560]   Dream, dream.
[00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:42.440]   Over alert.
[00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:44.160]   It works for TMZ.
[00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:46.720]   Just call me Perez Laport.
[00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:47.760]   I could do.
[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:49.840]   I could deal with the money that guy's making.
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:52.360]   Can he gain about 80 pounds though, Leo?
[00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:52.920]   No.
[00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:55.760]   He isn't the most attractive fellow, is he?
[00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:56.760]   No.
[00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:59.840]   And he doesn't help himself by dying his hair pink.
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:02.960]   There are some 14 year old girls who can pull off that look.
[00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:05.840]   However, that 14 year old girl is not Perez.
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:06.560]   Yeah.
[00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:09.320]   Slightly overweight guys in LA.
[00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:10.720]   Not really their pink.
[00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:11.360]   It shouldn't be.
[00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:14.480]   Oh, he says, Steve was, he says, I can't.
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:19.440]   I'm in Budapest late tired sick, writing a speech for tomorrow.
[00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:21.880]   No problem, Steve.
[00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:24.120]   Feel better.
[00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:25.480]   Well, we tried.
[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:27.120]   He's in Budapest.
[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:29.880]   There's one of us want to be the fake was Steve Wozniak.
[00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:30.320]   Yeah.
[00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:33.440]   So Mr. Wozniak, how do you feel?
[00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:34.920]   Here we are.
[00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:38.400]   My goodness, it's 14 years since the Apple II was discontinued.
[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:39.560]   How do you feel about that?
[00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:44.240]   Refreshed, Leo, refreshed here in the airplane.
[00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:49.080]   There is this sort of like lemon soaked cloth napkins they give out about every
[00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:49.400]   hour.
[00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:51.640]   All you got to do is just basically wave your hand in the air.
[00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:55.080]   And I've been waving my hand like I've got some sort of a spasm.
[00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:57.320]   I've got my face, my neck, my ears.
[00:25:57.320 --> 00:26:00.360]   I smell I smell like a freshly mopped floor.
[00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:03.920]   You know, Woz, they might be more helpful if you stopped cutting your meat
[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:05.920]   with your business card on the airplanes.
[00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:08.920]   That sometimes could scare the attendance a little bit.
[00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:11.240]   Actually, actually, that's that's your kind of behind.
[00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:15.880]   I actually now have a ballpoint pen that has a 14 gigawatt ring,
[00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:16.960]   ruby laser.
[00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:20.960]   I actually just you click it once you get a pen, you click it twice and you get
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:24.640]   a stylus, you click it three times, you're cutting at least three inches.
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:27.120]   Worth of any large protein slab.
[00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:31.680]   I did sign for a check at a restaurant and I did cut a whole straight through the
[00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:32.400]   table top.
[00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:37.800]   I did have my gummed pad of $20 bills.
[00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:39.960]   I just tore off from a couple of sheets and we're all good.
[00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:41.960]   I love it.
[00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:44.440]   That's probably what I'm going to lead off with with that keynote tomorrow because
[00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:45.400]   that's a really good story.
[00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:46.160]   I think it is.
[00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:49.960]   And it's, you know what, as much as we're joking, that that's exactly the kind of
[00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:52.480]   what's with dude to be honest with you.
[00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:56.600]   We've, Andy and I have spent time on a boat with with Woz.
[00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:58.480]   We know we know the power of the laser.
[00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:02.480]   Well, I think this is this is the time where I tell my was on a boat story.
[00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:04.080]   Oh, you've been on a boat with Woz too.
[00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:06.360]   I have been left out.
[00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:07.200]   Yeah.
[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:07.920]   Sorry, Brett.
[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:14.520]   Here I am sitting outside one of the lecture rooms and I've got my Mac open
[00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:19.160]   and I've got iPhone open and sure enough, here's Woz and here are his pictures
[00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:22.120]   on iPhone because he's got sharing on his excellent.
[00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:23.720]   I look through his stuff.
[00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:25.520]   These are amazing pictures.
[00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:28.120]   I wish I had some of these and then I thought, wait a minute, I have an iPhone.
[00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:29.960]   So I'll just click, click, click, drag.
[00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:35.320]   Hey, I do have some of those, which is kind of a security problem.
[00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:40.200]   What someone might have mentioned to to Mr.
[00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:44.680]   Woz and next time fake was you run into the real was you might mention this is
[00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:49.280]   that putting your IPO in your iPhoto library, not such a good idea.
[00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:51.560]   Oh, my goodness.
[00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:52.600]   Really?
[00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:56.680]   I'm just saying it was a joke.
[00:27:56.680 --> 00:28:01.320]   There's some real little pis and in Fresno that's been after me and after me
[00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:02.960]   and after me for inside of trading stocks.
[00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:07.840]   This way I can both ruin him and his hand him into the FCC and to the FBI because
[00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:11.720]   we were actually in international waters, which for legal reasons,
[00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:13.720]   turned into another nation state.
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:15.600]   So we get to interpol involved.
[00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:17.680]   And I mean, the fun part isn't putting him in jail.
[00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:21.200]   The fun part is visiting him in jail on my segue.
[00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:24.720]   And I just sort of roll past window, roll past one of the other actions and do
[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:26.200]   waving.
[00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:29.640]   You know, Steve, Steve is I mentioned to Stephen.
[00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:31.120]   I'm chatting back and forth with him.
[00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:33.680]   I mentioned that we were telling a cruise stories.
[00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:36.760]   He said, like what I plugged an adapter in and stuck the cord in my mouth and
[00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:38.280]   my teeth flashed.
[00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:39.600]   Remember that joke?
[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:43.080]   Apparently he says he's working on a new book called I Prank.
[00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:45.680]   I would buy that book.
[00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:47.320]   He'd be the one to finish.
[00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:49.480]   I would buy that book.
[00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:51.120]   Here's a great prank you can do.
[00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:54.920]   Step one, withdraw $1.8 million out of your checking account.
[00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:59.680]   Buy a one of a kind limited edition high security at a photo lab.
[00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:03.680]   There's only available in Stockholm, but then you simply pay another $800,000,
[00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:04.560]   have a shipped over.
[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:08.400]   Then you make an ID card that makes you look like you're actually secretary
[00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:09.280]   general to UN.
[00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:13.000]   Now, now that you have that done, you go into your local Wendy's drive through.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.560]   Order the chicken diablo.
[00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:22.800]   He says he has also a Budapest pun.
[00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:24.920]   He says, I'm hungry, but a pest today.
[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:29.000]   Hey, I'm channeling Steve.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.200]   Steve was the client chat here.
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:34.080]   Other other big stories.
[00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:35.520]   Well, there really aren't any.
[00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:38.640]   I guess you could talk about and we did on Twitter the fact that in Britain,
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:42.600]   the iPhone has lousy service, much better a hacked iPhone on Vodafone.
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:46.800]   According to Will Harris, much better service than the real legit iPhone on.
[00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:47.440]   What is it?
[00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:48.320]   The O2 network?
[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:48.840]   What is it?
[00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:50.760]   I thought they were going on T-Mobile.
[00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:52.320]   Or is that just in Germany?
[00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:56.240]   Well, and that's and that's another story, which is that T-Mobile is selling
[00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:58.520]   unlocked iPhones in Germany.
[00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:00.440]   They're apparently required to.
[00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:03.920]   Couldn't you go there and buy one and use it anywhere?
[00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:04.920]   Yeah.
[00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:06.080]   I want to.
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:09.920]   Yeah, if you have $1,300 to drop or something, I mean, that it's incredibly
[00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:10.800]   expensive to get one of those.
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:13.880]   I'm going to be in Frankfurt in a couple of weeks.
[00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:15.680]   Maybe I should see if I can get one.
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:18.240]   It's 999 euros.
[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:20.800]   Oh, well, that's not.
[00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:23.200]   Hey, I'm spending more than that to fly there.
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:23.920]   Well, great.
[00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:24.720]   Get one for all of us.
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:25.920]   Yeah.
[00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:28.200]   What branch of the government do you work for?
[00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:33.360]   You think that spending $1,000 extra to avoid like a $200,
[00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:34.880]   switching your service charge?
[00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:35.600]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:37.480]   Yeah, it's not a good way to see.
[00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:39.920]   You've got a steam job that's waving his little fist in the air.
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:41.240]   Damn you, Leo.
[00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:42.760]   You've got to round our legs.
[00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:45.160]   So I stuck it to the man.
[00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:49.360]   And then of course, every time an update comes out, you've got to fly back to Europe
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:52.760]   and get the French version, you know, because you don't want to get the American version
[00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:53.320]   because it's crap.
[00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:54.120]   Well, that's what I wonder.
[00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:59.760]   What what I guess the the the the the unlocked iPhone, the 1000 Euro unlocked iPhone.
[00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:01.160]   Can you not update it?
[00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:02.680]   What happens when the update comes out?
[00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:03.600]   Does it?
[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:04.840]   It must somehow know.
[00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:08.400]   You mean updates don't automatically brick iPhones?
[00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:11.200]   Mm.
[00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:17.280]   It's got to have some, you know, thing in it that says it's an unlocked phone.
[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:17.960]   Mm.
[00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:19.560]   Gee, you interesting.
[00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:25.320]   Wonder how long before the iPhone dev team figures out what that thing is.
[00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:28.840]   And then applies it to other unlocked phones, you think?
[00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:31.680]   How much is 999 euros?
[00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:32.480]   That's that's a lot.
[00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:33.640]   It's like almost two grand.
[00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:35.120]   Yeah, it's close to two grand.
[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:35.960]   Oh my God.
[00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:39.640]   I could open up my currency converter in the dashboard.
[00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:40.720]   That's quite all right.
[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:45.480]   Finally, a use for dashboard other than just getting in the way.
[00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:45.920]   Yeah.
[00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:49.720]   Other than demonstrating the leopard, I'll tell you what, since you mentioned lemon
[00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:54.920]   scented paper napkins, I think it's a good time to pause for our audible commercial.
[00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:57.600]   And then we'll do our picks of the day and we'll wrap this thing up since there really
[00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:58.640]   is nothing to talk about.
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:01.880]   Um, are filled with five minutes.
[00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:04.160]   Yeah, yeah, it was mostly Kindle.
[00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:07.600]   In fact, you know, it's interesting and this people, I get complaints all the time.
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:09.520]   Why do you talk about the iPhone all the time?
[00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:11.200]   Well, it was a big story for a few months.
[00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:12.160]   Why are you talking about liberal?
[00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:13.400]   There was a big story for a film.
[00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:14.600]   Why are you talking about Kindle for?
[00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:17.360]   Cause it's the, we just talk about what there is to talk about.
[00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:19.520]   Would you prefer Perez Hilton?
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:22.960]   Would you do the, do the people want fluff?
[00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:24.520]   Cause if that's what they want, we can give it to them.
[00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:25.360]   Okay.
[00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:26.400]   Get your fluff ready.
[00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:30.600]   But first, ladies and gentlemen, this show brought to you as usual by the good
[00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:31.440]   folks at audible.
[00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:34.120]   Audible.com.
[00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:38.480]   Audible.com/MacBrite could get you credit to a free book that you can even
[00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:39.640]   listen to on your Kindle.
[00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:43.720]   I'm, you know, it's interesting that Microsoft with a zoom was unable to make
[00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:46.520]   an audible deal, but Amazon was, what's the deal?
[00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:49.560]   Oh, you know, excuse me.
[00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:50.120]   Hello.
[00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:57.000]   Uh, in fact, in a way, you could say it's undermining, um, it's undermining
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.080]   uh, Amazon's own business.
[00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:02.400]   They're selling audio books or they allow audio books when they're trying to
[00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:04.160]   sell print books and yet they support it.
[00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:10.040]   And the zoom does not anyway, go figure the zoom is one of few devices, just a
[00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:12.280]   few that don't work on with audible content.
[00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:15.480]   All the iPods do the iPhone does pretty much everything.
[00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:18.880]   Everything you can imagine does hundreds of devices.
[00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:23.400]   And now get this 45,000 plus titles.
[00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:28.760]   All you want to do is go to audible.com/MacBrite can get a free title.
[00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:31.480]   In fact, I think Andy has a recommendation for us this week.
[00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:36.160]   Yes, this is, uh, I'm a big fan of Douglas Adams.
[00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:39.840]   I suspect that our demographic also has a lot of overlap in big fans of Douglas.
[00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:44.240]   My favorite, and I'm going to, I'm going to say, pull off some, if you're
[00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:46.800]   listening to this in the car, pull off to the side of the road, take the key out of
[00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:50.080]   the ignition, or rather put the key back in the ignition, put it, turn it on to
[00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:51.920]   accessories so you can still hear the podcast.
[00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:52.320]   Thank you.
[00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:54.000]   Uh, cause I'm going to say something sacrilegious.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:58.600]   Uh, my favorite Douglas Adams book is not part of the Hitchhiker's guide series.
[00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:02.720]   It is actually his detective novel, Dirk Gently's holistic detective agency.
[00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:03.680]   Why do you like it better?
[00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:09.240]   Because, uh, the Hitchhiker's guidebooks were written really on the fly.
[00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:14.400]   They were serialized radio drama and Douglas Adams, it's legendary that he
[00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:17.840]   was writing pages almost as quickly as they were performing them.
[00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:20.640]   So he had to really make things up as he was going along.
[00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:24.000]   It was absolutely brilliant, but you can sort of tell, even when you read it
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.120]   in book form, that here's the point at which some guy in a motorbike came to his
[00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:31.240]   hotel room, ripped the page out of the typewriter and said, we're going to press
[00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:32.760]   in 20 minutes, it's done.
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:34.120]   Uh, and that's it.
[00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:38.920]   Uh, with Dirk Gently's holistic detective agency, it really feels as though a book
[00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:43.640]   that was really thought of as a novel first that was worked out intricately from
[00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:44.360]   start to finish.
[00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:46.720]   It's still really imaginative.
[00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:52.680]   His vision, he uses in analogy about how user interfaces and computer power work that I
[00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:54.440]   still use at least once a month.
[00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:57.880]   Uh, there's a computer inside this, uh, inside this novel.
[00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:02.760]   And he's talking about how there's an inverse relationship between the amount of
[00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:07.880]   computing power that a computer uses to do what you've asked it to do and the amount of
[00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:12.600]   power it uses just to figure out what it is you wanted to do that in the 1970s, an
[00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:17.640]   Apple two computer used 99% of its power to add two plus two and 1% to read the key
[00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:19.720]   strokes to have you get those keys in.
[00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:23.720]   But now 90% of the power of drawing the user interface and figuring out where the
[00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:27.560]   mouse is and doing all those cool halo effects just to make it easier for you to tell it
[00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:28.120]   what to do.
[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:29.480]   Really cool thing.
[00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:31.160]   And this is not something out of Hitchhiker's Guide.
[00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:34.120]   It's something out of Dirk, gently, so detect detectivatency.
[00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:40.520]   So this is sort of bringing things full circle because the BBC decided to adapt this novel as
[00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:41.640]   a radio drama.
[00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:45.960]   This isn't one very nice British actor reading the book page for page.
[00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:48.680]   This is a fully staged BBC radio drama.
[00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:54.120]   Those of you who've been listening for a while probably know that I actually plugged
[00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:58.440]   this radio drama about a month and a half ago, it just finished airing about two weeks ago.
[00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:05.960]   If you go to BBC, I believe it's BBC4, it's a BBC.co.uk/radio4.
[00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:12.360]   If you do a search on Dirk Jutney, you will find not only a episode guide to it.
[00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:14.760]   I think you can also listen to a trailer of it.
[00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:21.560]   It says here that it's going to be re-aired on June 26th, 2008 at 6.30 on Radio 4.
[00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:24.280]   So if you don't want to wait that long, you can actually buy a call up in here.
[00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:26.600]   Yep, exactly.
[00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:27.640]   Put it on your iPhone.
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:33.000]   I'll have to set a custom ringtone to remind me to be somewhere listening to my computer at that
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:33.560]   point.
[00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:37.240]   Or you can just have this as your free book and get all six episodes.
[00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:40.920]   I was downloading them and listening to them as they were airing.
[00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:44.840]   And it really is a really faithful and really wonderful presentation.
[00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:49.400]   If you've never read Dirk Jutney before, this is a really great introduction to it.
[00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:52.360]   It will make you go off and see the book, even though it does not involve
[00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:55.560]   dabbelfishes or two-headed galactic presidents.
[00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:59.480]   It's funny, I'm such a fan of a hitchhiker that I hadn't read,
[00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:00.840]   Dirk Jutney.
[00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:03.560]   So I'm going to have to put this on my audible list right now.
[00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:05.720]   Is it Steven Freud reading this also?
[00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:07.320]   No, it's not read.
[00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:08.280]   Again, it's a full performance.
[00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:09.320]   Oh, it's the third thing.
[00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:11.400]   Bill Billy Boyd, Andrew Sacks, Jim Carter.
[00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:14.680]   It's three hours and 40 minutes all totaled with their sound effects,
[00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:15.720]   their environmental effects.
[00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:17.880]   But is this the same as BBC4?
[00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:20.520]   It's the exact same thing as the Radio Trauma.
[00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:27.240]   I just remembered that it is Mac related because one of the lead characters is a Mac developer.
[00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:33.720]   It's not all about using Xcode to recompile something for Intel.
[00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:38.200]   There is a really big subplot inside the Macintosh world.
[00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:40.600]   So if you're listening to this podcast because you like Macs,
[00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:47.720]   you will find reasons to at least mentally tax deduct the free cost of this
[00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:49.960]   download because it is indeed Mac related.
[00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:53.160]   Well, and we know that Douglas was a Mac fan.
[00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:57.800]   In fact, I think he and Steven Fry bought the first Macs in Britain.
[00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:00.680]   Douglas Adams bought number one, Steven Fry bought number two.
[00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:02.120]   Yeah, so that's kind of cool.
[00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:03.320]   I mean, it's really neat.
[00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:07.960]   I got a letter from somebody saying, oh, how dare you recommend Steven Fry reading Hitchhiker's guide
[00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:15.560]   because I don't know why that Douglas Adams never wanted it to be read and wouldn't have chosen
[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:17.480]   Steven Fry. I don't think that's the case at all.
[00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:21.480]   Wow, what an honor to get like Steven Fry's kid.
[00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:22.040]   No kid.
[00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:24.680]   He's got a little Adam's daughter to actually call him like that.
[00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:26.280]   Was his daughter that didn't want to do that?
[00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:31.400]   Oh, no, no, I'm saying someone who knows for a fact that Douglas Adams didn't want that happen.
[00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:33.320]   It must be a close relative or something really.
[00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:37.400]   It couldn't be somebody who just picked that up off of some dude on the internet.
[00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:39.720]   It never happens that way, Leo.
[00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:40.440]   Oh, you're right.
[00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:40.920]   You're right.
[00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:43.880]   Anyway, Dirk gently, I've just added it to my audible list.
[00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:49.000]   You could do the same absolutely free going to audible.com/macbreak, A-U-D-I-B-L-E.com.
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.200]   Just a couple more days left on their half price sale.
[00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:54.280]   1,000 plus unabridged titles.
[00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:56.120]   Actually, it ends today.
[00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:59.000]   So you're better shop now.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:02.360]   I love audible A-U-D-I-B-L-E.com.
[00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:03.160]   Put it on your candle.
[00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:07.160]   We thank them for their support of Macbreak weekly.
[00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:08.680]   I keep losing Brett.
[00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:12.520]   We're going to get him receiving it back on because it's time for our picks section.
[00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:15.000]   Chris Breen, hello.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.400]   Hey, Brett, welcome back.
[00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:18.200]   Can you hear us now?
[00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:23.640]   Yeah, something my wireless network has been going for the last 12 minutes goes up and down.
[00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:24.440]   Yeah.
[00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:25.560]   Well, I'll just keep calling you back.
[00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:26.600]   I don't mind.
[00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:27.560]   It's exciting.
[00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:28.600]   I don't mind.
[00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:30.440]   I just rebooted my router.
[00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:31.000]   Well, there you go.
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:31.960]   That might help.
[00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:34.280]   We're on to the picks section.
[00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:36.200]   Chris Breen's going to kick us off with a-
[00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:36.920]   I am.
[00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:38.600]   I'm going to go old school.
[00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:39.400]   Yes.
[00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:40.600]   Old old school.
[00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:41.560]   Old school.
[00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:42.360]   Old old school.
[00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:45.400]   This is a program called Ishito.
[00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:52.200]   It is computer puzzle game from 1989 that was released by Mac Play and the author,
[00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:55.720]   who is Ian Gilman, has released it for free.
[00:39:55.720 --> 00:40:02.360]   And you can get it at IanGilman.com/software/shito.php.
[00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:08.840]   Currently, this version works in Classic and on OS X, but not on Intel Max.
[00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:13.160]   Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait for it.
[00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:16.360]   If you stay on that page, you'll find a link to TomTom Labs,
[00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:19.800]   Ishito from Mac OS X, which does work on Intel Max.
[00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:22.600]   And this is a beautiful puzzle.
[00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:23.240]   Yeah, I see right here.
[00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:27.160]   The puzzle is wonderful to play, but it's also a very pretty game.
[00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:27.880]   Is it like Go?
[00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:33.560]   No, it's actually you're taking these look like mahjong tiles.
[00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:37.880]   And the idea is you're matching color and pattern together to try to
[00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:39.720]   get higher point matches.
[00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:40.200]   So if you can--
[00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:40.600]   Sounds good.
[00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:42.440]   Yeah, it's a wonderful game.
[00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:45.800]   And it's if you're an old school Mac person, you know this game.
[00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:48.760]   And if you're not, and it's new to your, it's free.
[00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:53.880]   It's worth the download, either the Classic version or using the new Intel version,
[00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:58.200]   which lacks those cool sound effects and the fortune at the end if you win the game.
[00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:01.720]   Ian Gilman has a pretty interesting software portfolio.
[00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:04.200]   Yeah, he wrote this when he was 17.
[00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:05.800]   So this is his first work.
[00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:07.080]   And how can I have the other programs?
[00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:08.280]   I don't know what he did Supergoo.
[00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:09.320]   He did Seize the Day.
[00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:13.400]   He did the Live 365 Mac client.
[00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:16.600]   He did Bryce talk, which is, I mean, Metasquares.
[00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:21.080]   This guy has been a busy fellow, but it's so neat that he's releasing the stuff for free now.
[00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:22.280]   That's really cool.
[00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:22.840]   It is nice.
[00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:26.360]   So it was nice of Mac play, whoever owns that material now to just say,
[00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:27.000]   oh yeah, go ahead.
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:27.720]   Who wants this?
[00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:28.200]   I do.
[00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:28.600]   Thank you.
[00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:32.840]   When they come out with Dark Castle for Intel.
[00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:33.240]   Oh, Dark Castle.
[00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:34.040]   Oh, well, Dark Castle.
[00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:36.520]   Wasn't that a great game?
[00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:37.400]   It's a great game.
[00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:38.840]   I still hear the...
[00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:42.920]   I don't know why.
[00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:43.320]   I just...
[00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:45.880]   I use that sound in a Mac Radio Challenge too.
[00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:47.240]   I said, who can identify this?
[00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:47.720]   I'm playing it.
[00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:50.760]   Unfortunately, the sound system was terrible because I'm sure Andy would have gotten it.
[00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:51.320]   It's a really...
[00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:52.280]   Really?
[00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:53.240]   I just love that sound.
[00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:54.120]   Do nobody got it?
[00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:57.880]   Well, unfortunately, the people on stage didn't have monitors.
[00:41:57.880 --> 00:41:59.880]   So it was bouncing off the back wall and it sounded like...
[00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:01.080]   [mumbling]
[00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:03.720]   I don't know.
[00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:05.080]   Was that Microsoft card?
[00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:06.040]   [mumbling]
[00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:07.080]   [laughing]
[00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:07.560]   [laughing]
[00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:09.000]   [moaning]
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:09.880]   So, is that...
[00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:12.520]   Is that at Mac World Expo you do that?
[00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:13.000]   Yeah.
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:13.560]   Yeah, why did I...
[00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:15.160]   I have no longer doing it now.
[00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:15.800]   What?
[00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:16.280]   I've done...
[00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:19.240]   No, because Andy has taken over the game show circuit.
[00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:23.480]   I said, I've done well, I've had enough, and now it's Andy's turn.
[00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:24.680]   So what are you going to do this year, Andy?
[00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:30.680]   It's a new game that I've come up with called the process of elimination.
[00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:35.320]   You start off by have a screen up with 50 different Apple products on it.
[00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:40.040]   If you guess the correct one, then you win the prize wonderland.
[00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:42.600]   So you can either have a one in 50 chance of guessing it,
[00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:47.960]   or answer a series of questions correctly, and each correct answer will either randomly
[00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:51.160]   remove some of the wrong answers from the board,
[00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:54.200]   or it will give you a hint as to which one it actually is.
[00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:55.080]   So if I tell you that...
[00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:55.640]   Good lore.
[00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:56.600]   This sounds like an advice.
[00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:57.720]   That's false programming.
[00:42:57.720 --> 00:43:01.000]   I'm starting to realize that.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.240]   There's one of those ideas that came to me in four minutes,
[00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:05.720]   and it took me two minutes to email this to Paul Kent,
[00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:07.400]   and three minutes for him to decide,
[00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:08.360]   "Oh, wow, that's a great idea.
[00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:09.080]   Let's do that."
[00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:10.520]   And then I realized that,
[00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:13.800]   "Oh, I'm going to have to do some cocoa to make this happen, aren't I?"
[00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:15.560]   "Cocos."
[00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:16.920]   Perhaps I could get it interred for that.
[00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:17.960]   "This will take cocoa, and..."
[00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:19.000]   Oh, wait, I don't have it interred.
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:19.880]   "And that taking chips."
[00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:21.880]   Well, I'm just glad, because when you said the process of elimination,
[00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:23.080]   I thought it was about poo-poo.
[00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:24.600]   So it's about cocoa.
[00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:25.480]   It's much better.
[00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:26.520]   Much better.
[00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:27.560]   So when will we see that?
[00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:29.160]   We will see.
[00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:31.560]   I believe it's happening on Thursday, afternoon,
[00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:32.200]   three-something.
[00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:35.160]   I just got the Macworld Expo pre-registration,
[00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:36.040]   and the catalog,
[00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:37.240]   and everything just arrived in the mail,
[00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:38.200]   and my mailbox today.
[00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:42.040]   So, again, boy, Paul's doing a great job of selling it,
[00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:45.720]   because apparently we're close to a sellout on both Expo Halls.
[00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:46.760]   Hurry, hurry, hurry.
[00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:49.080]   Yeah, we have a whole booth,
[00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:51.480]   a podcasting pavilion that Alex Lindsey has arranged for,
[00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:52.760]   and we're going to be doing all the shows
[00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:57.320]   in public on the show floor in the West Hall all week long.
[00:43:57.320 --> 00:43:58.760]   So, Andy, please come, and Chris,
[00:43:58.760 --> 00:44:00.600]   and Brett, are you coming to Macworld Expo?
[00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:01.560]   Of course you are.
[00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:02.520]   When is it happening?
[00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:03.080]   The days?
[00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:04.360]   Seventh?
[00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:05.080]   Is it the seventh?
[00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:05.640]   When is it?
[00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:07.320]   Is it the same time as CES?
[00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:09.400]   No, it's a week after CES this time.
[00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:11.160]   Oh, so it's the 14th or the 18th?
[00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:11.480]   Yeah.
[00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:14.200]   I may actually try and make it out for them.
[00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:15.080]   Well, anybody who's there--
[00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:15.720]   I'm trying to see us.
[00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:16.360]   Be on the show.
[00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:19.000]   We're going to do two Mac break weeklies,
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:20.840]   one right after the keynote on Tuesday,
[00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:22.360]   and another one later in the week,
[00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:23.960]   and we'll do Twit there as well,
[00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:26.840]   and a number of other other shows from the show.
[00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:29.960]   Has there been any discussion of what might be in the said keynote?
[00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:32.840]   Yeah, well, what is your suspicion?
[00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:34.520]   Nobody's come up with anything.
[00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:37.800]   We keep hoping it'll be maybe a mini Mac or a tablet.
[00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:39.080]   I think it's the Kindle killer.
[00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:41.560]   Wouldn't that be funny if Apple had a reader?
[00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:42.200]   I think.
[00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:45.080]   They have been rumors that Apple's doing a reader for a long time.
[00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:46.920]   Yeah.
[00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:48.760]   And that gets folded in with a tablet too.
[00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:50.840]   So, yes, well, it's a tablet, but look what else it does.
[00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:52.360]   And you saw this patent.
[00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:54.760]   We don't usually report on patents on this show,
[00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:59.320]   because in my opinion, a patent isn't very indicative,
[00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:01.480]   because these companies just patent everything,
[00:45:01.480 --> 00:45:02.200]   just in case.
[00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:03.720]   It doesn't mean they're going to make something.
[00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:05.720]   But there is a new touch patent that Apple
[00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:12.840]   did just recently get that involves a handheld touch device
[00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:15.080]   using the pinch.
[00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:17.960]   So maybe.
[00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:21.000]   I could see them incorporating that into a,
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.800]   perhaps a laptop for children.
[00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:25.720]   Ooh, you think that's what they're going to do?
[00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:28.440]   I'd, you know, simplify.
[00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:30.280]   Because I mean, when you use the iPhone,
[00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:32.920]   it's got a great user experience.
[00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:34.520]   That's an interesting idea.
[00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:36.040]   So I've always been wondering,
[00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:38.760]   like, well, when would they incorporate that into a computer?
[00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:41.160]   See, I'm more thinking about,
[00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:44.920]   I was actually asked to participate in Macworld's
[00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:47.640]   usually predict 2007,
[00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:50.600]   I can easily predict 2007, 2008.
[00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:50.840]   Good job.
[00:45:50.840 --> 00:45:52.920]   News items.
[00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:56.360]   And the thing that I keep coming back to is the idea of,
[00:45:56.360 --> 00:46:00.920]   take a MacBook screen and cut that real estate in half vertically.
[00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:03.400]   So you have just the left hand side of that screen
[00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:08.360]   and encase it in a very nice iPhone, like casing with that nice
[00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:10.760]   black panel with a chrome rim around it.
[00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:12.440]   And see what, think,
[00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:16.520]   spend some time thinking about what happens when you have a touch surface.
[00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:21.080]   That's that large that can show an entire width of a sheet of paper
[00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:26.120]   that also has Wi-Fi that also maybe even has 3G connection to the internet.
[00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:30.360]   You look at all the technologies that have been rolled into leopard,
[00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:35.960]   and it's easy to convince yourself that so many of these new technologies
[00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:40.360]   are all about sharing fundamental services that are on your Mac
[00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:43.080]   with an arbitrary device that is not your Mac.
[00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:45.720]   So for instance, tunneling back to your,
[00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:48.920]   being able to find your Mac no matter where it is and get files off of it,
[00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:51.240]   being able to run applications locally on your Mac,
[00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:55.240]   through basically through a window on the device.
[00:46:55.240 --> 00:46:58.680]   The idea of a super iPhone, a super iPod,
[00:46:58.680 --> 00:47:03.000]   and a device that essentially lets you project features from anywhere else
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:04.040]   in the internet into it.
[00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:07.080]   It's the sort of thing where it's just, you know,
[00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:11.640]   just like those insane people who keep trying to go after the, the, the Beel treasure,
[00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:13.720]   and they come, they're the ones who finally crack the code
[00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:17.400]   and they put $10,000 into digging up this buried treasure.
[00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:20.200]   It's easy to convince yourself once you have a good theory
[00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:23.880]   that you know where the buried treasure is lied or, or you know exactly how the Kennedy
[00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:29.160]   assassination came off, or you know exactly the next thing that Apple's going to release in January.
[00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:32.200]   But I think it's an interesting line of thought.
[00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:35.000]   Again, every time I look at leopard's features,
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:40.120]   I'm seeing not technologies that make for a superb version of 10.5,
[00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:44.440]   and it is a good operating system, but I see features that could lead to a really
[00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:46.520]   great new classic consumer devices.
[00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:49.080]   Well, maybe we'll see it.
[00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:51.880]   They usually announce consumer stuff at Mac world Xbox.
[00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:52.120]   Right.
[00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:57.400]   I think we'll at least see updates to the MacBooks because we haven't seen that.
[00:47:57.400 --> 00:48:00.120]   I would love to see it at two or three Mac book.
[00:48:00.120 --> 00:48:01.720]   No, speed and performance.
[00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:02.440]   Yeah, I would too.
[00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:04.520]   I'd love to see a thin notebook.
[00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:07.560]   And I'm going to, I'm going to go out on a limb here and say,
[00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:12.040]   I think we're going to see an eight and 16 gigabyte iPhone because that's a no brainer.
[00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:13.320]   Oh yeah, I'm sure that's the case.
[00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:15.480]   That's got a 3G.
[00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:16.040]   I don't know.
[00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:18.120]   3G, I think, might not come till later next year.
[00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:22.040]   T-Mobile is, I'm sorry, AT&T is saying they're rolling out that
[00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:24.600]   HSDPA much more widely.
[00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:25.800]   T-Mobile is too, by the way.
[00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:27.160]   So maybe...
[00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:29.560]   You know what AT&T needs to do?
[00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:33.320]   They need to roll out cell service and then worry about high speed.
[00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:35.800]   We still don't get it in Vermont or Alaska.
[00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:39.160]   I don't get cell service in the middle of Central Park.
[00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:40.280]   Oh, New York City.
[00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:41.240]   Yeah.
[00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:42.680]   Or driving down 8th Avenue.
[00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:43.400]   Forget about it.
[00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:44.440]   It's just Manhattan.
[00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:45.000]   It's okay.
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:46.760]   At least you can buy it.
[00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:48.680]   Can't buy it in Vermont.
[00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:54.200]   So Brett Larson, do you have a pick for us any cool software or hardware you'd like
[00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:55.160]   everybody to know about?
[00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:57.320]   Well, I do love my iPhone.
[00:48:57.320 --> 00:49:00.360]   You can't do that.
[00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:05.400]   You know, hardware-wise, I got this cool, I'm going to talk about this.
[00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:08.040]   I got the new Canon, HG10.
[00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:09.400]   The hard drive version.
[00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:10.120]   The hard drive one.
[00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:10.520]   Yeah.
[00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:11.640]   With the high definition.
[00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:12.920]   That's fantastic.
[00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:17.640]   It's, you know, I do a lot with video, not necessarily by myself.
[00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:19.720]   That sounds really awesome.
[00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:21.000]   That's very interesting.
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:22.440]   Would you like to share more about that?
[00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:25.320]   A little night vision camera hidden in the corner of my bedroom.
[00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:27.480]   That is by Vermont.
[00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:29.480]   All major credit cards accepted.
[00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:30.760]   Email me, Perez Hilton.
[00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:31.960]   You'll have the exclusive.
[00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:38.280]   No, you know, I got, they sent it to me a couple of weeks ago for a show that we're doing.
[00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:41.320]   The video quality is great in low light,
[00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:43.480]   which is what these cameras usually have problems with.
[00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:43.960]   Right.
[00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:47.560]   As soon as you step inside, it looks like garbage.
[00:49:47.560 --> 00:49:50.440]   It gets a little grainy when it gets really dark.
[00:49:50.440 --> 00:49:56.520]   I, which I program is it, iMovie recognizes it when you plug it in.
[00:49:56.520 --> 00:49:59.080]   Final Cut Pro does not, which is odd.
[00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:02.360]   But you can pull the video in, and it's really high quality.
[00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:03.960]   I mean, it's so high quality.
[00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:06.360]   My poor little MacBook Pro can't keep on.
[00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:07.320]   Is it AVCHD?
[00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:08.280]   It must be.
[00:50:08.280 --> 00:50:08.600]   It is.
[00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:09.880]   It's AVCHD.
[00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:11.080]   So that's why iMovie does it.
[00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:14.200]   And then, by the way, the new Final Cut Express will, which just came out.
[00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:15.240]   Well, why doesn't Final Cut?
[00:50:15.240 --> 00:50:16.360]   I've never understood why.
[00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:17.880]   Did you have regular latest Final Cut studio?
[00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:20.840]   Yeah, I've got what's, uh, Final Cut Studio 2 here.
[00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:22.040]   I wish Alex Lindsey were here.
[00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:23.640]   He could explain.
[00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:24.520]   He could explain all.
[00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:27.880]   So basically, what I have to do is I have to take it in through iMovie
[00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:31.160]   and then dump the file into Final Cut.
[00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:33.400]   Yeah, the new Final Cut Express does that really nicely.
[00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:34.680]   It reads iMovie files.
[00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:37.720]   It's really designed for an iMovie upgrade.
[00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:39.160]   Yeah, I bought it because I thought, you know what,
[00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:41.080]   I'm never going to figure out studio.
[00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:43.400]   Yeah, it's very complicated.
[00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:46.440]   But this is relatively cheap compared to studio.
[00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:48.360]   It's only, what, 300 bucks?
[00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:50.680]   And I think I can figure it out.
[00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:54.200]   So yeah, no, we've been a fan of the HP 20.
[00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:55.400]   We've been talking a lot about that.
[00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:56.920]   And I've been very interested in the HG 10,
[00:50:56.920 --> 00:50:59.160]   which is the hard drive version of that.
[00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:01.960]   It's not because you know, I was out in California over the weekend
[00:51:01.960 --> 00:51:03.400]   to see the fam for Thanksgiving.
[00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:05.240]   And you know, you keep it with you anywhere you go
[00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:06.120]   because it's so small.
[00:51:06.120 --> 00:51:08.760]   And the quality is actually,
[00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:09.640]   I'm impressed.
[00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:13.640]   I mean, I have a GL2, a mini-DV camera that I use a lot.
[00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:16.520]   And I would say it's almost on par with that.
[00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:18.440]   That's a pretty high quality, very expensive.
[00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:21.160]   Yeah, like a, you could broadcast that on TV
[00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:22.520]   if anyone remembers television.
[00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:23.400]   TV, what's that?
[00:51:23.400 --> 00:51:27.000]   All right, the HG 10 is Brett Larson's pick.
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:32.200]   I think it's time for Andy and I go to select a device or program.
[00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:33.720]   Or a thingy.
[00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:36.520]   I'm a little bit embarrassed because I can't find it
[00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:37.560]   on the company's website.
[00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:40.920]   There are two, this weekend in New York
[00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:42.680]   turned out to be a test of two or three different things.
[00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:43.800]   One was the Kindle.
[00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:47.960]   Another was a really interesting laptop bag by Crumpler
[00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:49.240]   that arrived.
[00:51:49.240 --> 00:51:49.800]   Terrible name.
[00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:52.680]   Boy, oh, terrible name.
[00:51:52.680 --> 00:51:54.440]   Even worse, terrible website.
[00:51:54.440 --> 00:51:57.240]   It was designed by some junior high school student
[00:51:57.240 --> 00:52:00.440]   who just learned Flash about eight minutes ago
[00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:03.480]   and has never read Jacob Nielsen's books on website design.
[00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:03.960]   Oh dear.
[00:52:03.960 --> 00:52:06.440]   Because, I mean, I-
[00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:07.880]   Tell us how you actually feel.
[00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:10.120]   Crumplerbags.com, if you will.
[00:52:10.120 --> 00:52:13.080]   I like the loading, the 800 point loading.
[00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:15.400]   Oh, we're making some pretty real.
[00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:17.080]   Boy, it's a weird user.
[00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:19.080]   Listen to the audio, it's just bizarre.
[00:52:19.080 --> 00:52:21.320]   Oh my gosh.
[00:52:21.320 --> 00:52:23.160]   You have it all going to it now?
[00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:26.120]   Yeah, don't all go to it at once, it'll-
[00:52:26.120 --> 00:52:29.560]   It says it's handmade by the Sputnik Agency.
[00:52:29.560 --> 00:52:32.680]   I think it was made, but I think someone did this with their feet,
[00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:33.480]   not with their hands.
[00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:34.920]   It's a fit man.
[00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:35.560]   It's handmade.
[00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:37.560]   Designed in 1956.
[00:52:37.560 --> 00:52:38.920]   Look, it's got a chain you can pull.
[00:52:38.920 --> 00:52:40.680]   What's-
[00:52:40.680 --> 00:52:42.840]   Oh dear, it flushed the toilet.
[00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:46.440]   Website design by Billy.
[00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:47.160]   Eight seven.
[00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:49.080]   I kind of like it.
[00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:50.120]   In-
[00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:51.800]   Wow.
[00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:53.240]   Oh, in the U-
[00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:53.960]   Oh, okay.
[00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:54.280]   Sorry.
[00:52:54.280 --> 00:52:56.040]   I was reading the site like, what does that say?
[00:52:56.040 --> 00:52:59.320]   It does have a little bit of a toilet humor to it.
[00:52:59.320 --> 00:53:00.440]   And it's-
[00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:00.840]   Wow.
[00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:01.480]   Pull the chain.
[00:53:01.480 --> 00:53:03.160]   Or press that red button.
[00:53:04.840 --> 00:53:06.360]   I have no my sound turned down.
[00:53:06.360 --> 00:53:08.600]   Keep it turned down, believe me.
[00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:12.520]   It's a little eerie.
[00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:15.000]   So the crumpler bag, yes.
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:15.560]   Okay, shoot.
[00:53:15.560 --> 00:53:17.640]   Yeah, so they sent me-
[00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:20.680]   I did not know what was going to arrive.
[00:53:20.680 --> 00:53:23.320]   Sometimes you get these PR people who email you,
[00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:26.760]   and they got something they want to show you,
[00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:30.200]   and it's weird enough that you know that you really have no place to write about it,
[00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:31.720]   but you just want to see this thing.
[00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:36.120]   So they offered me the Tony Blair limited edition laptop bag.
[00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:39.880]   It is a laptop bag that looks-
[00:53:39.880 --> 00:53:40.600]   It looks pretty cool.
[00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:42.920]   It's like trimmed out in blue and orange,
[00:53:42.920 --> 00:53:48.840]   but you open it up and you find that the entire lining is just a repeating pattern of Tony Blair is like smug, smiling little face.
[00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:51.080]   So, so as a-
[00:53:51.080 --> 00:53:51.880]   As a-
[00:53:51.880 --> 00:53:52.280]   As a-
[00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:54.040]   To commemorate his exit from office.
[00:53:54.040 --> 00:53:55.240]   That's bizarre.
[00:53:55.240 --> 00:53:57.400]   After, you know, he came into the Korean War, I believe.
[00:53:57.400 --> 00:53:58.680]   I'm sorry, the Korean police action.
[00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:02.200]   But, okay, so forget about Tony Blair.
[00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:06.360]   It's actually- I've never used a crumpler bag before,
[00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:08.760]   and I actually really, really liked it.
[00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:09.160]   It has-
[00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:13.800]   There are sleeves that are good for pretending a notebook,
[00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:16.520]   but they're really not good for carrying stuff around.
[00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:21.080]   There are- I have a whole big collection of backpacks and laptop bags
[00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:22.600]   that are great for carrying all-
[00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:25.240]   You're notebook and all the crap that's associated with it.
[00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:28.920]   There are very, very few notebook bags that are good for just the look.
[00:54:28.920 --> 00:54:30.680]   I'm having a day outside.
[00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:31.800]   I'm just one of the notebook.
[00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:33.080]   I also want to have my newspaper.
[00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:34.680]   I want to- I want to be boarding a train,
[00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:36.840]   so let me be able to keep my tickets handy.
[00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:38.040]   That sort of stuff.
[00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:40.440]   It is a really nice hybrid between a-
[00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:43.720]   Just a plain laptop sleeve and a complicated notebook bag.
[00:54:43.720 --> 00:54:45.960]   The pockets are big, deep, and accessible.
[00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:50.440]   There is a big newspaper pouch on the inside that you-
[00:54:50.440 --> 00:54:51.640]   That you wear.
[00:54:51.640 --> 00:54:53.960]   So it's easy to sneak things inside and out of it.
[00:54:53.960 --> 00:54:58.680]   I didn't really- I love my notebook backpack that I normally wear,
[00:54:58.680 --> 00:55:01.720]   but I didn't realize until I spent a couple days with this on a trip
[00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:07.080]   that I realized how much I miss being able to easily just dip a magazine into a bag and get at it.
[00:55:07.080 --> 00:55:10.280]   Or a device like the Kindle to simply get it out for some access
[00:55:10.280 --> 00:55:12.760]   and then put it back in and then forget about it.
[00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:17.640]   And also it has lots of really smart ideas that there are pockets that are accessible,
[00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:20.440]   but if you're in the subway, you can zip them closed
[00:55:20.440 --> 00:55:21.880]   and all the zipper pulls will be-
[00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:24.600]   will face forward so you know that no one's sneaking a hand in there.
[00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:27.240]   You can make it as open or as secure as you want.
[00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:29.160]   And also it looks nicely bizarre.
[00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:31.080]   So the problem is that-
[00:55:31.080 --> 00:55:33.800]   I don't know whether I'm being stymied by this website design
[00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:37.320]   or whether it's just so limited edition that they only made one of them
[00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:39.960]   and they gave it to me just to trick me into writing about them.
[00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:42.240]   But I cannot find the Tony Blair-
[00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:42.760]   - That's right.
[00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:45.160]   - I cannot find the Tony Blair limited edition on their site.
[00:55:45.160 --> 00:55:47.720]   I cannot find a mention of it anywhere else.
[00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:52.440]   And I assume that they didn't make just this one design just for this one product.
[00:55:52.440 --> 00:55:56.920]   I assume that they just took an existing model and redesigned it.
[00:55:56.920 --> 00:55:59.960]   And just added the new color trim and then the new lining.
[00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:04.280]   But looking through their website, once you manage to hit the mute button on your Mac,
[00:56:04.280 --> 00:56:10.760]   you find that it really has a nice wide variety of different styles, different bags.
[00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:14.120]   I really like this bucket style that they have,
[00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:19.160]   where it looks like almost an English country bicycle basket only done in ripstop nylon
[00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:23.640]   and probably very very suitable for carrying a camera body in a few lenses on it.
[00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:24.200]   - Very cool.
[00:56:24.840 --> 00:56:29.880]   I like the names of them too, the total embarrassment, the moderate embarrassment.
[00:56:29.880 --> 00:56:31.000]   That's a great name product.
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:33.800]   - I wonder if they have a Maggie Thatcher limited edition.
[00:56:33.800 --> 00:56:36.360]   I didn't mind that.
[00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:37.720]   - Could we pause recording?
[00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:42.680]   Because I think I need 15 minutes to come up with about eight Thatcher jokes.
[00:56:42.680 --> 00:56:43.640]   - Thatcher jokes.
[00:56:43.640 --> 00:56:44.360]   Okay, hold on.
[00:56:44.360 --> 00:56:45.880]   We're going to wait for Thatcher jokes.
[00:56:45.880 --> 00:56:50.440]   - I need to start playing some sex pistols just to get into the right frame of mind for a customer.
[00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:52.200]   - Wait, no, I like that.
[00:56:52.200 --> 00:56:54.680]   I think I'm always looking for a good laptop bag.
[00:56:54.680 --> 00:56:56.840]   Obviously it's a British, it's a UK company, yeah.
[00:56:56.840 --> 00:56:59.400]   - I believe it's actually an Aussie company.
[00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:00.440]   - Oh, interesting.
[00:57:00.440 --> 00:57:04.600]   - It's the Western one, the Barney Russell blanket, the soup and salad son, oh.
[00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:08.840]   I'm going to, well, gee, actually, I shouldn't say, I think these are the sort of names
[00:57:08.840 --> 00:57:13.560]   where I immediately want to go to urbandictionary.com to make sure it's not something absolutely
[00:57:13.560 --> 00:57:14.440]   filthy disgusting.
[00:57:14.440 --> 00:57:14.920]   - Too late.
[00:57:14.920 --> 00:57:18.040]   You've already revealed your deepest, darkest secrets to us all.
[00:57:18.040 --> 00:57:19.800]   - You know, Forfi is the new second base.
[00:57:19.800 --> 00:57:21.000]   - What?
[00:57:21.720 --> 00:57:23.480]   - I know, I was a shock as you are.
[00:57:23.480 --> 00:57:24.120]   - These kids today.
[00:57:24.120 --> 00:57:24.600]   - These kids today.
[00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:25.480]   - God, I look that up.
[00:57:25.480 --> 00:57:30.840]   We said, you know, when I worked at Tech TV with all these people in their 20s, like you, Brett Larson,
[00:57:30.840 --> 00:57:36.760]   I was going to the urban dictionary like daily, because they would say stuff and I go,
[00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:37.720]   what the hell?
[00:57:37.720 --> 00:57:41.800]   And I have to look it up and they go, oh my God, these kids.
[00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:44.760]   Now they're in their place.
[00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:45.160]   - I'm on it right now.
[00:57:45.160 --> 00:57:47.560]   - Yeah, yes, it's a wonderful, useful site.
[00:57:47.560 --> 00:57:50.440]   You'll never, you'll never wonder again what they're saying.
[00:57:51.080 --> 00:57:53.720]   So my pick is something absolutely free zero, Alex's.
[00:57:53.720 --> 00:57:57.240]   If you remember Kidpix, what a wonderful program.
[00:57:57.240 --> 00:57:58.840]   I think it's the same guy who did Kidpix.
[00:57:58.840 --> 00:58:02.040]   He's now doing an open source version called Tuxpaint.
[00:58:02.040 --> 00:58:06.920]   And it is a noisy and fun program for painting.
[00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:10.840]   Now it's not for adults, but I think an adult might have some,
[00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:12.520]   that's the eraser I'm playing with right there.
[00:58:12.520 --> 00:58:13.800]   Might have some fun with it.
[00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:17.640]   It's got the rubber stamps that Kidpix was so famous for.
[00:58:17.640 --> 00:58:19.160]   It's got all this.
[00:58:20.360 --> 00:58:21.560]   Remember that great program?
[00:58:21.560 --> 00:58:22.760]   Wasn't that a fun program?
[00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:23.800]   Did you play with it right?
[00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:26.760]   - Yeah, I remember when it first came out actually.
[00:58:26.760 --> 00:58:26.920]   - Yeah.
[00:58:26.920 --> 00:58:28.360]   - Sad, but who?
[00:58:28.360 --> 00:58:29.960]   - So do I, Broderbund.
[00:58:29.960 --> 00:58:32.120]   So I think this is the same guy.
[00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:34.520]   And he's kept it alive with Tuxpaint.
[00:58:34.520 --> 00:58:36.680]   It's a great, absolutely free.
[00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:41.160]   Get it from tuxpaint.org, T-U-X-P-A-I-N-T.org.
[00:58:41.160 --> 00:58:45.480]   Linux Windows, of course, and Macintosh, OS X supports Intel.
[00:58:45.480 --> 00:58:48.520]   And it goes full screen, which is kind of neat.
[00:58:48.520 --> 00:58:50.520]   You can actually blow it up as big as your screen is.
[00:58:50.520 --> 00:58:54.440]   Although the default is a nice 640x480.
[00:58:54.440 --> 00:58:57.240]   So if you have an older Mac, this would be a great choice as well.
[00:58:57.240 --> 00:58:59.240]   Great thing to, you know, as long as you got color,
[00:58:59.240 --> 00:59:00.840]   great thing you can give the kids.
[00:59:00.840 --> 00:59:04.760]   And they can make funny sounds and draw crazy things.
[00:59:04.760 --> 00:59:07.000]   Tuxpaint.org.
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:08.040]   It's got backgrounds.
[00:59:08.040 --> 00:59:10.920]   It's got stamps, all sorts of fun things.
[00:59:10.920 --> 00:59:13.720]   And that's my pick for a week.
[00:59:13.720 --> 00:59:14.760]   We do want- - Hello, hello.
[00:59:16.040 --> 00:59:17.640]   No, don't bother saving that.
[00:59:17.640 --> 00:59:19.800]   Do you- - You guys aren't hearing the sound effects,
[00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:21.080]   but believe me, it's making noise.
[00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:23.240]   I have to jump in here though.
[00:59:23.240 --> 00:59:24.040]   Yes.
[00:59:24.040 --> 00:59:26.440]   Because it's actually not by the same guy.
[00:59:26.440 --> 00:59:26.920]   It's not?
[00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:27.800]   No.
[00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:29.800]   Who was a guy who did the Kidpicks?
[00:59:29.800 --> 00:59:30.600]   Craig Hickman.
[00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:31.320]   That's right.
[00:59:31.320 --> 00:59:32.920]   And this is- - And he also got a geek cruise.
[00:59:32.920 --> 00:59:37.000]   And he wrote a program called Beautiful Dorena.
[00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:39.320]   That was an amazing- - Is that still around?
[00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:41.640]   It's around and it's still on his website.
[00:59:41.640 --> 00:59:44.360]   So if you go to pixelpopin.com-
[00:59:44.360 --> 00:59:44.920]   That's right.
[00:59:44.920 --> 00:59:45.640]   I forgot about that.
[00:59:45.640 --> 00:59:49.880]   That was basically his open source or free version of Kidpicks.
[00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:52.040]   Yeah, but it's even better.
[00:59:52.040 --> 00:59:54.040]   I mean, in a way, it's really bizarre.
[00:59:54.040 --> 00:59:56.360]   So if you're looking for Kidpicks, don't look at this, but it's-
[00:59:56.360 --> 00:59:59.720]   It has a lot of totally useless effects in it,
[00:59:59.720 --> 01:00:01.640]   which are really fun to play with.
[01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:05.480]   And I showed it to my daughter and she really likes Beautiful Dorena a lot.
[01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:06.040]   It's free.
[01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:07.000]   I completely forgot about this.
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:07.560]   Yeah.
[01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:08.120]   You know what?
[01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:10.280]   Forget Tuxpaint.
[01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:12.680]   No, no, no, Tuxpaint's good too.
[01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:14.040]   It's just not by the same guy.
[01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:14.600]   Get both.
[01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:18.600]   Bill Hendrick did Tuxpaint.
[01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:18.920]   Oh.
[01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:21.720]   Yes, thank you for the correction.
[01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:23.800]   And thank you for reminding me about Beautiful Dorena,
[01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:25.480]   which I've used for a long time with kids.
[01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:26.760]   And it's wonderful.
[01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:27.880]   Really good.
[01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:29.720]   And it's free as well.
[01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:30.840]   So that's a twofer.
[01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:31.720]   Thank you, Chris Breen.
[01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:32.520]   Sure.
[01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:34.200]   That's an excellent reminder.
[01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:35.160]   Love and love.
[01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:39.000]   Now, I do want to say congratulations
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.480]   to a fellow who is not with us right now,
[01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:43.480]   but who has a very good reason for it.
[01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:44.600]   True.
[01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:46.360]   Alex Lindsey had a baby.
[01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:48.200]   Well, Carlita had the baby.
[01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:53.000]   Alex did all the panting, but Carlita did the work.
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:58.120]   Maliki John Alexander Lindsey was born.
[01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:03.000]   Alex, remember Alex wanted to have that SMS announcement system?
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.080]   It worked.
[01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:06.120]   I got the SMS.
[01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:07.720]   I think I got it on Saturday or Friday.
[01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:10.520]   But all it said was, it's a boy.
[01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:12.200]   So I don't.
[01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:15.800]   I did get later confirmation that it was,
[01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:19.080]   I don't know the exact date, but it is Maliki John Alexander.
[01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:20.280]   Lindsey, everybody's doing great.
[01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:25.240]   And if you go to web.mac.com/AlexLindsay,
[01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:28.920]   he has put a picture up for all to see.
[01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:30.200]   So we congratulate Alex.
[01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:34.680]   That rounds out the trio of Twits who were pregnant.
[01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:37.720]   We had Patrick had his baby, Seamus.
[01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:40.200]   Merlin had his baby Eleanor.
[01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:42.120]   And now Alex has Maliki.
[01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:44.360]   Anybody else pregnant?
[01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:46.120]   Anything else you want to tell us guys?
[01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:47.160]   Anybody else?
[01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:49.800]   I closed on my apartment here in Manhattan.
[01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:52.600]   That's kind of like having a baby only.
[01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:53.880]   You're so sexy in the city.
[01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:57.400]   You're just, you're just living.
[01:01:57.400 --> 01:01:59.320]   So you haven't, you own in New York.
[01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:03.160]   I own a little slice of Manhattan.
[01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:05.400]   I remember when I first as a disc jockey,
[01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:07.640]   got to the major market, which was San Francisco.
[01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:09.640]   A guy had been there for years.
[01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:10.920]   Buddy, Hatton pulled me aside.
[01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:13.400]   Said, "Get, I got some advice for you."
[01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:14.600]   He said, "What is it, Mr. Hatton?"
[01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:16.120]   "Rent, don't buy."
[01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:19.240]   Oh, great.
[01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:21.640]   I'm in the big city now.
[01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:24.120]   But you, obviously, you believe you're going to stay.
[01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:25.800]   I would like to.
[01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:26.280]   Yeah.
[01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:26.680]   Good.
[01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:27.240]   That's great.
[01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:28.040]   Congratulations.
[01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:28.680]   My plant.
[01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:32.280]   I just passed the four-year mark here in the Big Apple.
[01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:33.000]   You're doing great.
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:37.880]   You know, May 11th of next year will be the 10th anniversary of the
[01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:40.840]   birth of tech TV, of ZD TV at the time.
[01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:43.000]   I think we really should do something with all the time.
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:43.320]   Really?
[01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:44.520]   It's next already?
[01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:45.640]   10 years.
[01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:48.440]   10 years.
[01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:48.840]   Start?
[01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:50.120]   I do too.
[01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:51.080]   I was there.
[01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:52.120]   I remember this.
[01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:52.520]   I was there.
[01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:53.080]   I remember.
[01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:58.040]   Of course, it's being reborn, reburst through things like this,
[01:02:58.040 --> 01:02:59.320]   Network and Revision 3,
[01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:02.520]   which is looking more and more like tech TV all the time.
[01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:05.560]   So maybe 10 years later, it's coming back.
[01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:07.080]   I want to thank everybody for being here.
[01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:10.760]   We thank our hosts Audible.com for providing us with the
[01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:11.800]   wherewithalladoodishow.
[01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:13.880]   Brett Larson is on Channel 5.
[01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:15.640]   True, that.
[01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:19.080]   And you can watch for his specials for the holidays.
[01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:21.320]   Also on many stations.
[01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:22.600]   Are they all Fox stations?
[01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:23.720]   They are.
[01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:24.600]   The O&Os.
[01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:26.200]   The O&Os all over the country.
[01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:27.160]   The O&O's.
[01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:29.720]   Which is not the one in the Fox affiliate in San Francisco,
[01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:31.320]   not owned by News Corp.
[01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:31.800]   Damn them.
[01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:33.320]   I know.
[01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:33.560]   Damn them.
[01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:35.560]   Maybe they'll quickly get owned.
[01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:36.920]   True.
[01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:37.400]   Or probably.
[01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:37.720]   That'd be nice.
[01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:38.840]   Thank you, Brett.
[01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:39.880]   It's great to talk to you again.
[01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:40.920]   Thank you.
[01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:41.560]   Good to be here.
[01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:42.600]   Congrats on the apartment.
[01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:44.200]   Andy Inacos in the Chicago Sun times.
[01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:46.040]   Look for his Kindle review soon, yes?
[01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:49.880]   Yes, on Thursdays, Chicago Sun times.
[01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:51.320]   But I think we got a good preview here.
[01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:54.040]   Yeah, again, I.
[01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:57.240]   Wrote my first draft of it last night.
[01:03:57.240 --> 01:03:59.320]   It came in at 1,300 words,
[01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:02.840]   which is quite significantly longer than the space that I'm allotted.
[01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:04.360]   So I'm probably going to.
[01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:06.440]   I'm actually considering for the first time
[01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:08.120]   explicitly saying, look,
[01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:09.400]   please go to my website.
[01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:09.720]   Wow.
[01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:11.320]   I'll continue to blather on about this.
[01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:14.440]   Because again, I'm.
[01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:19.640]   It's almost become a default device for reading blogs because.
[01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:20.440]   Most of the time it's.
[01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:22.360]   See, you see what I'm doing?
[01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:24.760]   It's so it's such a cool thing that you just can't stop talking about.
[01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:25.640]   It's very, very good.
[01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:28.040]   Was the waffle making robot in the article?
[01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:32.120]   The waffle making robot is the that's the lead.
[01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:34.120]   It's going to be in there by hook or by crook.
[01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:37.320]   As will the phrase a visual fart every time you turn a page.
[01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:38.840]   Okay.
[01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:40.920]   I've checked in with my editor.
[01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:42.520]   I do have permission to use that for.
[01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:45.320]   I know you're talking about that flash that you get on all these e-ink screens.
[01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:46.280]   It drives me crazy.
[01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:49.400]   Yeah, that's why I spent some time lying on myself.
[01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:52.680]   I read one chapter of a book on the Kindle and another chapter,
[01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:54.440]   the exact same book via.
[01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:56.680]   Project Gutenberg on the iPhone.
[01:04:56.680 --> 01:05:01.160]   And that's why I have to declare the reading experience a push between the two.
[01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:02.440]   Because there's no visual.
[01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:03.800]   You're fart on the iPhone.
[01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:06.920]   The screen, you get natural scrolling on top of everything else.
[01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:08.440]   The iPhone screen is backlit.
[01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:15.000]   The e-paper, it's a nice technology, but it's always going to be black text on your
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.280]   gray background.
[01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:19.160]   It's always going to have a satiny finish so that you have to have a light on it and
[01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:22.200]   you have to adjust it so that you're not getting glare off the screen.
[01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:26.360]   I'm really looking forward to the first e-book that decides to say screw it.
[01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:31.720]   We're going to lose this pathetic,
[01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:35.640]   fetish about having a week of battery life.
[01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:38.280]   We're going to have something that lasts only a day and a half but is going to be the most
[01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:41.000]   beautiful screen to read ever.
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:44.520]   Jerry Pournell said on Twitter, he said, "I think the iPhone is the best e-book reader there is."
[01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:50.760]   Yeah, I mean, I have any book application on my jailbreak iPhone.
[01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:57.640]   And again, I can actually sit there and actually, for pleasure, read page after page after page.
[01:05:57.640 --> 01:06:01.480]   And the device fades into transparency around the thing that I'm reading.
[01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:05.160]   Because it's... I'm not sure yet that that's exactly what's happening on the Kindle.
[01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:06.680]   People have said that though.
[01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:07.880]   I guess give it some time maybe.
[01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:09.160]   See, give it some...
[01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:12.040]   You know, www.cwob.com.
[01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:13.720]   That's where the full Kindle review will be.
[01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:16.040]   And look for the Waffle Making Robot.
[01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:16.920]   It's my favorite part.
[01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:19.640]   If head out to a farmer's market at 4.30 in the morning,
[01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:22.840]   you'll probably get a tachytern keeping to himself.
[01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:25.400]   It's a Waffle Making Robot.
[01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:27.480]   You use it as a speed pass to pay for everything.
[01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:29.320]   That's probably though, that's probably someone's Kindle.
[01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:37.000]   And Chris Brin, who is Kindle-free, but has the kinders, but not the kindles.
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:44.680]   And he is of course at Macworld Magazine and in the 9/1 Mac 9/1/1 column.
[01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:49.000]   And on the Apple phone show, what else can we see Chris Brin?
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:55.880]   I host Macworld's podcast and I do their video podcast once a month.
[01:06:55.880 --> 01:06:58.040]   So to see the Buffant of Knowledge.
[01:06:58.040 --> 01:06:59.000]   Right.
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.120]   In all its glory.
[01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:02.200]   Yeah, we have to put filters on this.
[01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:04.200]   You know, and it was a very serious thing.
[01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:07.640]   Bruce G has designed a specific filter just for my hair.
[01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:08.200]   I love it.
[01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:09.480]   Thank you all.
[01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:12.680]   Another Mac break is broke.
[01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:27.400]   [Music]
