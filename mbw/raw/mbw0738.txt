[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly Andy and Icoz here. Renee Richie's here. Lori Gill is here lots to talk about.
[00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:10.240]   We all got the invites. Apple's big event next week. We'll talk about what to expect.
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:19.040]   Apple's quarterly results are out and it looks pretty darn good. Even though iPhone sales are no longer driving the entire company,
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:25.120]   maybe that's a good thing. And Christopher Walken joins Apple TV Plus. It's all coming up next on Mac Break Weekly.

[00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:55.000]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show we cover the latest news from Apple.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.760]   And there's news from Apple. Hello Renee Ritchie from youtube.com/ReneeRitchie.
[00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.840]   I'm dancing because there's actual Mac news. Not just Apple news, but Mac news from Break.
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.120]   It's from Mac-Toach News. Very, very excited.
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.880]   And you are at sweater weather now in Quebec, I think.
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:24.280]   It was minus five Celsius yesterday. I actually had to turn my... I told Lori I wasn't putting my heat on. I think she gave me a massive internet eye roll.
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.840]   That's Andy Inaco, Chortling Ole there. Andrew is with WGBH Boston.
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.800]   And of course Inaco.com and a regular on this here show. Hello Andy.
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:40.280]   Hello and yeah, I'm kind of with you Renee. I had my first really, really cold night,
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:46.360]   just a few nights ago. Actually, it was Halloween night. And I was up until like 1am watching scary movies.
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.880]   And then I realized that I could actually see my breath in the room.
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:55.640]   Which was great for the master film festival. I realized that no, it's because it's 30 degrees outside.
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:02.760]   You have not turned the heat on in this drafty old house. And then I proceeded to turn it on in my bedroom so high that by the next day,
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.520]   I turned it down, but not after getting some bread dough ready because it was a perfect temperature for proving bread.
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:14.040]   Also with us ladies, gentlemen, I don't know if she's baking, but she is hot.
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.280]   I'm sorry.
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.160]   That didn't work.
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.960]   That did not work. I'm just going to go home now.
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:26.360]   I was trying for a segue. That was not it. It's Lori Gill, managing editor at iMOR.
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.720]   Hello Lori!
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:35.800]   Hello and you know, I totally get both of you. You're so cold. I was so cold on Halloween 2.
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.800]   I was outside watching a movie and then the movie tonight.
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.640]   Oh my gosh.
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.480]   Oh, I mean sorry.
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.000]   Oh my goodness.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.320]   There's snow on the ground right now, Lori.
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.800]   Thank you.
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.640]   It was like 48 degrees, right? Lori, I mean it was freezing.
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.840]   It was cold for us this time of year for us, but it stayed outside watching movies.
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:57.480]   Yeah.
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.120]   It was 82 yesterday, but I think there's a cold snap coming. It's going to be down in the 70s later this week.
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.360]   This week.
[00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.920]   Yeah.
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.000]   We left the door to Winnipeg Open. Sorry.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.240]   It's a draft coming from North.
[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:14.200]   I would have come up with some sort of a retort about weather in California, but most of it involves like
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.280]   weather that creates huge immense natural disasters with the losses of life.
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.480]   And so that's nothing to joke about.
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.080]   So, yes, you're right. It sucks to live in a cold climate.
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.480]   Mm.
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.480]   Well, point scored.
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.720]   It's not burning. It's not burning. That's always good.
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.760]   So, surprise, John Prosser was wrong. We're going to have to
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.840]   lower his score a little bit.
[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:40.120]   The next Apple event will not be on the 17th. It'll be on the 10th.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.440]   And the invitations have gone out. They went out yesterday to avoid today's election.
[00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.680]   Yeah, this makes a lot more sense to me. You don't want to wait until
[00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.880]   practically Thanksgiving before you announce anything.
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.280]   I love the title of the invitation. One more thing.
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:02.680]   And it is a picture of the Apple logo with the beach ball behind it.
[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.920]   Okay, maybe not the best choice of colors, but
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:09.960]   there's something coming out of its mouth. It looks like a projector.
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.960]   I don't know. It's a breath weapon. If you play D&D, that's a breath weapon.
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.360]   But it is the case, in fact, that the virtual reality of this,
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:23.000]   or augmented reality of this, kind of teases a little bit better.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.920]   Here is from Neil Seibart.
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:29.640]   You projected onto a nice wooden table earlier today.
[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:35.080]   Oh, look at that. That's cool. Earlier today,
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.400]   Mike Sargent put it on a laptop itself. It does look like an opening laptop, doesn't it?
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.320]   Yeah. Yeah. That's a lid.
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.880]   Look at it, Barry, close your eyes.
[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.200]   All the color coming out, glowing around it, and then
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:51.000]   the beach. You should almost hear that chime.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:59.480]   So we've actually seen a number of kind of confirming rumors around,
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:09.080]   well, first the beta, Big Sur 11.0.1 developer beta had references to three unreleased Macintosh.
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:10.280]   Computers.
[00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:15.640]   And now Mark German kind of confirming that in Bloomberg.
[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:23.480]   I love his lead. Apple's 15 year relationship with Intel Corp will officially begin to unwind.
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.440]   Next week, when the new Mac computers are revealed.
[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.680]   It only makes it sounds sad.
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:33.560]   I just wish they could have made it out there like Burton Lonnie.
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:42.280]   So apparently from Ikea Foxconn is building two 13 inch laptops and Quanta computer,
[00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:45.560]   which is built this Quanta builds. Does it build some of the Macs?
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:48.600]   Yeah, they tend to diversify their product.
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:52.520]   Okay. They're building a 16 inch MacBook Pro.
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:07:01.720]   So the rumor is two new 13s and a 16.1 of the 13s will be a MacBook Air, not a MacBook Nutton.
[00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:08.280]   And they'll all have Apple Silicon, obviously. That's the whole point of this announcement.
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:16.520]   Do you all concur? Does that sound reasonable? We were thinking it would be a laptop with three.
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:22.280]   Maybe I think maybe I'm thinking one available right away and then two later,
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.440]   maybe not till next year.
[00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:28.200]   Love to dream said 13 inch and then came back and said 13 inch times two.
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:31.080]   So but didn't say anything about a 16 inch.
[00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:31.320]   Yeah.
[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:38.680]   No, I like I like this rumor because all along, I thought that the best way to show off like
[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:43.880]   immediately, immediately, immediately the advantage of Apple Silicon would be extended battery life
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:50.280]   on a mobile device, because they they are if there's one signature that they've been working on,
[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:53.880]   ever since the first time they built their own chip for the iPhone, it's how do we tune out all
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:57.720]   the hardware to make sure that we get the most battery life possible under the smallest possible
[00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:59.640]   battery. I'm disappointed.
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:04.600]   I'm disappointed because german says beyond the processor switch, the devices will not have
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:09.160]   significant device change design change. That's normal though. I mean, because when Steve Jobs did
[00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:15.160]   the transition from, from power PC to Intel, they didn't do any changes. They were literally
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:19.880]   identical devices. And I think they just want to keep the complexity down. Like if you're moving
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:23.880]   the silicon target and the design target, there is a lot more opportunity for you to
[00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:27.640]   ruin yourself than if you give them say, this is your chassis.
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:32.600]   You just you do a complete gut transfusion. And then when that works, the next emphasize,
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:36.200]   then we have to buy two new computers and not just one Leo. This is how this stuff works.
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:39.560]   You see the silicon, then then you design.
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:45.560]   Even if it's just the how to move heat through the device, just that loan is reason to say,
[00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:49.960]   why don't we just keep the same chassis and fan design and just just worry about making sure
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.360]   these things can boot the finder. That does make a lot of sense.
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:58.120]   I was really looking forward to this smaller bezel for the 13-inch MacBook Pro. I was hoping
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.720]   it would be a 14-inch MacBook Pro.
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:04.760]   Yeah, it might even be who if you had to wait until next year for the mini LED screens.
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:07.400]   Do you think these will be mini LED, Laurie?
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:12.440]   I don't. I don't think the technology is quite ready yet. I think we probably will see that in
[00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:18.040]   2021. But I don't think we're going to see that with these max that are next week.
[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:22.520]   Certainly, one of the advantages will be better battery life, as you say, Andy.
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:25.080]   What about performance? What do we think?
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:31.640]   I don't know that that's going to be the highest. I keep thinking just about what do they need
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:36.040]   to prove with this first result. And I do think that they have to make sure they're delivering
[00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:41.480]   number one compatibility. Make sure don't scare people off to think that now we have two platforms,
[00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:49.160]   almost as if we have one community of Mac users using Mac OS 9 and another community using Mac OS 10.
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:55.800]   That's super high priority after that. So long as they show that there are tangible benefits to
[00:09:55.800 --> 00:10:01.400]   this outside of Apple, no longer having to be angry with Intel for causing, causing production delays.
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:06.120]   Then that's a win. I'm really fascinated to see if they, but it would be really, really
[00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:10.040]   interesting if they decided to say, you know what, what the hell we're going to make a Mac book pro
[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:15.480]   and we're going to the whole your only your only purpose here engineers is to make sure you smoke
[00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:19.720]   the previous generation at that price point. I don't even care if you have to put in that flat
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:23.240]   stupid flat keyboard that we still have 80,000 in stock of go for it.
[00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:30.840]   Well, it is interesting because if you go on in the in the german story, he also says that Apple
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:40.040]   will be releasing updates on its other computers, including a mini Mac pro, or a half size Mac pro.
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:47.320]   The thing they're just me about, you know, just the Mac books in general is that performance is
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:51.080]   not like, I know everyone just loves to fire up Geekbench and then show you a number, but really
[00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:56.120]   that's not how computers work at all. And the characteristics of Apple Silicon are going to be
[00:10:56.120 --> 00:11:00.040]   substantially different. It's going to be a much smaller die size, much smaller process,
[00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:05.160]   like five nanometers, Intel still struggling with 10 nanometers and performance and efficiency
[00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:10.520]   are inextricably tied together. The more efficient something is the better it can perform.
[00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:15.160]   And Apple is running the Intel chips at the thermal limits of those casing designs.
[00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:20.600]   Meanwhile, they're getting amazing performance at very low wattage and very small thermal envelopes
[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:26.200]   on iOS devices. So I think even if you just take the Apple Silicon, you put it in those roomier
[00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:31.880]   chassis and you amp up the power a little bit, you have those thermal cooling systems in there,
[00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:36.520]   and you have that efficiency, they can just let those things run. They can burst faster,
[00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:42.520]   they can sustain longer. And the best advantage, I think, and this, if you're all in on Adobe,
[00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:45.400]   you're going to be in for a couple of years, a hurt because they're not going to have premiere
[00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:50.600]   after effects optimized anytime soon. But if you're all in on Final Cut Pro or Logic,
[00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:55.720]   you were going to have a machine that is purpose built to run macOS, Final Cut Logic,
[00:11:55.720 --> 00:12:00.040]   all those things faster than anything else on the planet. And I think you will be ludicrously
[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:08.120]   happy from the go. Apparently, it's going to be a processor based on the A14 that's in the iPhone
[00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:14.360]   12 and the new iPad. Did that disappoint you, Laurie?
[00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:21.400]   This is the first time, right? This is the first Apple Silicon Mac. I guess I wanted it to be
[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:26.600]   something completely different than the mobile version of a processor chip because it seems like
[00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:31.240]   that's, it should be completely different, it shouldn't be related. But
[00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:40.840]   if it's also an A14 or maybe it's an A14 Z or maybe an X14 or something like that,
[00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:46.680]   but if it's based off the same architecture, that doesn't mean bad. If you think about how fast the
[00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:56.440]   iPad Air 4, for example, how fast it runs, you're nearly at the same speeds as you would for a
[00:12:56.440 --> 00:13:02.600]   Mac laptop. So if they are able to create the processing power needed for really,
[00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:09.640]   the really big programs with all of the other benefits that come along with the A14 chip,
[00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:18.520]   then you are looking at something good. It's new, it's hard to say because it sounds like
[00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:22.920]   that's a disappointment. It does. I was like, oh,
[00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:29.000]   you know, but that's not mean different things. Right. It's like when you talk about Intel,
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.760]   all the A14 means is that IP generation is Apple's A14 IP generation. Like the latest Apple Watch
[00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:41.240]   chip is based on the A13 IP generation. And it's not analogous, like it's by no means an
[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:46.840]   iPhone chip, but it's using the same basic core architecture. And so I don't know if this means
[00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:52.200]   like a literal A14 core and maybe Apple does have Mac specific IP blocks in there that they just
[00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:55.160]   don't use on the iPad. So it's really efficient to make those chips.
[00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:59.400]   Well, yeah, you could have more cores, you could have more GPUs. You could,
[00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:00.280]   there's all sorts of things.
[00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:07.160]   And you could have system specific IP blocks. So it's like an A14 T or it's an X14. And it's
[00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:11.960]   the same architecture, but it's specifically built for a Mac. Like Intel's, when you talk about
[00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:16.680]   my like, yeah, like Intel has two things, right? Like when you talk about their lakes,
[00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:21.560]   lakes are specific chips, but like four or five generations of those are built on one architecture.
[00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:25.000]   So there's a name for the architecture as well. And I think Apple's just, I think it's too easy
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.120]   to conflate that without the app.
[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:30.680]   I do have a prediction though, it may be the same form factor, but I think it's going to be
[00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:36.040]   powder coated matte black. What do you think? What about the blue Leo?
[00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:45.160]   The air's the air's might bring back some color. We might actually see the sky blue or the green
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:49.320]   in the back of airline. Yeah, I wouldn't mind. Yeah, it's totally possible.
[00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:55.400]   Should I get the when I order on Friday, should I get the blue iPhone 12 pro max so that it'll
[00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:59.800]   match my new Mac? None of the blues match Leo. None of them. None of them.
[00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:01.560]   Not a single one of the blues is your match.
[00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:04.760]   They don't match your.
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:09.800]   Oh, they don't match each other. No, we're, we're, we're such Apple people.
[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:12.840]   This is fun. They're my rose gold match.
[00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:17.480]   I had rose gold. They all match. Now these blues are just hard to take.
[00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:23.880]   Yeah, mind you mind you, if I, if I had that kind of money, yes, I would. I would match all these
[00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:29.480]   things. But like, I'm more of a like, oh, well, why am I by the same brand of shelf paper,
[00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:34.200]   he said, vinyl shelf paper, all of my devices. Yeah, we just put it on, on all of them.
[00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:39.320]   We need back to the 70s, a wood-grained Mac book, fake wood grain with plastic.
[00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:49.160]   So it does sound like Fox cons are on the way sooner than the quant hub 16 inch.
[00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:57.640]   So Gordon and German, at least the two 13 inches will be displayed on Tuesday.
[00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:02.680]   I don't know. You did. Go ahead, Laurie.
[00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:10.040]   What about the possibility of one of these actually being an Intel chip and hear me out?
[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:16.760]   What? I know. I know. And I'm just speculating here. I definitely don't think that this is on
[00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:23.000]   the table, but Apple was pretty adamant earlier on like right after WWDC. They made it very clear
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:29.880]   that they're going to continue to support Intel. So what I'm wondering is, are we going to see
[00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:36.760]   two of the exact same Mac laptops? One of them is Intel inside. One of them is silicon inside.
[00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:42.440]   And this is providing that opportunity of options. I think Renee has said this many times that
[00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:49.640]   for Apple, just providing the best of whatever you can get right here right now is the most
[00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:54.840]   important thing. And maybe there's going to be a lot of people who want a new Mac book, whatever,
[00:16:54.840 --> 00:17:01.960]   but they don't want silicon inside. And maybe this is them allowing that opportunity just a little
[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:07.000]   bit longer. Maybe just just till the end of this year, they're going to maybe have an Intel and
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.480]   an Apple silicon. It is the case when we get to the results, which we will in a little bit,
[00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:14.520]   that this is a record was was a record quarter for Mac.
[00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:21.640]   Right. There was a string and boot camp for a 20, 20, 16 inch. It could be the people saying,
[00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:25.160]   well, I got to get the last Intel one for whatever reason I need boot camp.
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:28.760]   You got to put a cap in Intel in both senses of the word Leo. Put a cap in it, man.
[00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:35.560]   Oh, I feel I feel I feel so dumb for not even thinking about it. Lori, that's that's I so
[00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:41.560]   like that idea of Apple making making a top there kind of what will probably be unannounced their
[00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:47.320]   last top end MacBook Pro running on Intel, because there's so much software that no, it's
[00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:53.400]   a downtime or a stutter or anything for losing two hours is like losing thousands of dollars for
[00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:58.120]   a lot of the people who buy these top end machines. I could totally see Apple saying,
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:03.240]   we've got the we're going to scare some of you. We're going to throw some of you.
[00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:07.320]   For those of you who are thrilled, here's the here's our new Apple Silicon MacBook.
[00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:11.080]   For those of you who are scared, we'll still take three thousand dollars of your money for the
[00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:20.280]   last year for the latest generation Intel. They might even offer it at a slightly lower price.
[00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:25.400]   You know, like here's two different versions of this of the of the Mac book pro for you. You can
[00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:29.960]   have this fancy new Apple Silicon one that's at the price point we always have, or you could
[00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:35.640]   spend a hundred dollars less on this Intel one because Intel or more, I think, because Intel
[00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:38.200]   charges them so much now for that generation. Yeah, that could be.
[00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:43.400]   But when it was also, they're thinking up the warehouse, they're making all the other Apple
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:49.880]   products feel bad. They were drivers also for the new generator, the big Navi chips that AMD
[00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:54.760]   just announced and no interesting for a Mac Pro because the Mac Pro, they're still going to offer
[00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:59.720]   cards for a while. And those look like really, really good GPUs finally from AMD. But you never
[00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:04.760]   know where that kind of fits going to show up either. Lori, I think you got a scoop.
[00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:12.120]   An imaginary scoop, but a scoop on the left more. I'm just I'm just thinking that's all.
[00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:16.360]   Yeah. Nobody told me anything. It's just my idea. Interesting. No, that makes a lot of sense.
[00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:19.880]   At first, I pooped it, but now that the other guy say it's.
[00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:29.160]   I agree. Well, I'm proud to have piggybacked on to somebody else's superior thinking and elect.
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:36.840]   You all have voted me. I'll tell you. Well, so I can't wait. I mean, I don't know about
[00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:41.640]   anybody else, but I can't wait. I mean, it's not even a question. I will buy probably if it's
[00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:46.360]   an air, I'll probably because I have the 2020 Mac book here. Where's it? 2019? I have the most
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:51.240]   recent Mac book here. So I would love to have a head to head comparison and see.
[00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:57.960]   Do you think big sir will come out on the 10th as well? 24 hours developers. You got 24 hours.
[00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:05.080]   Yeah. Well, I think they've held off this long. So they're probably going to release it the Monday
[00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:10.200]   or Wednesday before. I think it's actually the Wednesday before you can preorder or like the
[00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:14.440]   preorders actually are available. That's what they do with the phone typically. So yeah,
[00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:19.240]   if the preorders are Friday, they'd put it out the Wednesday before, which would be one day for
[00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:26.440]   developers. Sorry developers could be could be one day. They might even say that day. They might
[00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:33.000]   like next Tuesday. They might say, and by the way, big sir is now available. Right. They just don't
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:38.200]   know. They may also may not say orderable Friday. They could say orderable today. They could also
[00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:43.400]   say orderable December 10th. We just don't know. Right? What they're arriving New Year's Eve.
[00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:47.080]   Yeah. I mean, when when they announced the trash can Mac,
[00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:52.920]   I know that they announced it months before you could get it, right?
[00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:59.480]   WDC. Yeah. And then it shipped I think in December and one run off the Texas plant got out,
[00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:02.520]   I think, before New Year's. I got it. I mean, that got it. It's January.
[00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:07.640]   Yeah. Yeah. Also, they only said that they would ship Apple Silicon by the end of the year. They
[00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:11.080]   didn't necessarily say that everything that we announced that uses Apple Silicon will ship this
[00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:17.720]   year. So so long as they get 12 MacBook Airs with with Bailing Wire and hand soldered,
[00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:21.880]   connected to the middle working runs on AA batteries, they've met their promise.
[00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:30.440]   Well, it's a very exciting time, I must say. Isn't exciting. Well, for many reasons, including
[00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:35.400]   Mac. I'm just I for one, I'm glad to have something to take my mind off it.
[00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:42.040]   I now know when I go to bed tonight, I could be thinking about a new Mac instead of anything else
[00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:47.560]   that I might be. It's an announcement came out of nowhere and was just an absolute pleasant
[00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:53.480]   tree. And it's only a week from now, like a week from today. We're going to hear about this.
[00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:59.080]   We like we barely had to wait. It's so exciting. So exciting. Yeah. It's it's it's kind of like,
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:04.440]   it's kind of like when what was it Apollo Apollo eight, circumvent circumnavigating the moon
[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:10.040]   on Christmas, like at the end of a really terrible year, 1969. And everything. Oh, thank God. You
[00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:16.840]   said thank you, NASA. You saved you saved 1969 for us. There are other invitations that went out.
[00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:21.640]   If you're a developer, you might have gotten this get your apps ready for Apple Silicon Max.
[00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:28.360]   Nope, by the way, lowercase s in the silicon. So we now know that's not the name of the product,
[00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:34.200]   whatever it is. So that may be something else we learn next Tuesday, but get ready for Apple
[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:41.000]   Silicon Max with one on one labs. They're inviting developers to are they going to go to Silicon
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:48.040]   Valley? No, they'll be like FaceTime calls, right? You can request an appointment with Apple.
[00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:55.480]   If you have to have the developer transition kit first, so you don't expect that laptop under
[00:22:55.480 --> 00:23:04.200]   your chair. Still, this is this is getting there. Will they there was a rumor they might offer a
[00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:13.240]   test flight for Mac with at the same time. Great. Yeah. That's that would be great. Yeah,
[00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:18.200]   tests. So just to explain to me, Lori, what test flight is so that we know why it's great.
[00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:25.640]   It's a way for developers to allow other people to test out an app that's in beta. So on iOS
[00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:32.520]   and iPad OS, they developer can have an app that's fully baked, fully ready to go, but they don't
[00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:36.760]   want to put it in the app store yet. They want to have people tested out. So they use test flight.
[00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:43.720]   It's an app that you have on your phone and you get invited to to participate in that beta
[00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:49.240]   by just clicking on this little link and it's side loads it. But it's all on the up and up because
[00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:55.560]   it goes through the test flight, Apple's test flight thing. So it's not like sideloading it the way
[00:23:55.560 --> 00:24:02.280]   you might try to do with a jailbroken device or something like that. It works all secure and in
[00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:11.320]   your proper spots on your phone, but it lets you test out apps that are not yet available publicly.
[00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:16.360]   So this is going to be huge for developers to be able to do this kind of thing to get the word
[00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:23.640]   out to people to share their betas of things that are yet to come. I think that's incredible.
[00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:26.920]   I'm really happy to hear if that actually sounds. We should mention it's a rumor that was
[00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:34.040]   came from Avi David, who is the editor of the Verifier. Renee, I think this is,
[00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:41.800]   what is, is he one of the newer leakers? Is he have a leaking track record? Is the Verifier
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:47.640]   a reliable source? And is this one of those rumors that just makes sense like what Lori just
[00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:50.520]   said about it, not Intel Mac being announced on Tuesday or something like-
[00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:54.440]   Super, super suspicious right now because any time like right now everyone's like,
[00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:59.080]   oh, this means for sure we're going to get final cut and Xcode for for iPad on the same day.
[00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:03.000]   And it's just like the amount of people have been so much expectation will debt
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.520]   on what we're going to get Tuesday. And if anything, Apple usually focuses on very,
[00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:10.440]   very specific, there may be a press release a couple of weeks later, and maybe they will
[00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:13.880]   announce Test Flight if they do a whole deep dive into it. It seems like I'm really curious.
[00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:19.720]   Yeah, I'm really curious what Mac OS on ARM because at WWDC, not publicly, but in the sessions,
[00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:24.200]   they talked about all these great new ways it's going to do recovery and the secure butro
[00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:28.200]   pro- there's so many cool things in there that they haven't talked about publicly yet.
[00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:32.520]   And I hope we get some Craig Federiki time to show us some of them, not just like the hardware
[00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:36.920]   benefits, but some of the Mac OS benefits are moving, like sell us on those as well.
[00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:42.360]   I'm just I'm of course I had to be a little bit worried. It's like Laurie said, it's a
[00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:48.760]   great thing for developers. One of the problems of releasing beta or demo, excuse me, developer
[00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:53.080]   software is that almost by definition, the people who are going to be testing it for you
[00:25:53.080 --> 00:26:02.280]   have to have a certain level of expertise because the system for installing such a thing on a
[00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:06.600]   really, really lockdown device like an iPad or an iPhone would be so complicated that you won't be
[00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:11.960]   able to get just the target users of your to-do list app won't have the expertise or the
[00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:16.600]   interest in going through all those hoops to getting something to work. So this will this allows
[00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:22.840]   developers to release a development version of this thing for testing and have the people install
[00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:27.080]   it almost as easily as they would install something from the App Store. Now that's so that's really,
[00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:31.960]   really good. The thing that kind of got me worried because it is on my mind that if anything,
[00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:38.120]   the Mac platform is getting more lockdown, not more open that this could in the worst case scenario
[00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:43.160]   in a couple of years, this is why oh and by the way, now you can only get our apps through the App Store,
[00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:48.680]   you can't sideload, we're to protect all of our users, we are making sure you can't install any
[00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:53.880]   app that's not available through the App Store, you're welcome. If you complain, we chip a Linux
[00:26:53.880 --> 00:27:02.360]   box right to your house. If it's mid-linx, running on a thread ripper, okay,
[00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:09.080]   expandable RAM, go ahead, Darren, you come back so hard. So happy, God.
[00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:14.840]   I can't wait to get one of these. So just give me an idea what you all think,
[00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:20.440]   Laurie, I'll start with you, Laurie. What can I, I didn't understand, we're spitballing here,
[00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:24.440]   but what could I expect? Great battery life, Laurie, like 22 hours,
[00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:33.080]   three weeks. I mean, yeah, I think they're definitely going to be, you know, giving us all the great
[00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:39.480]   hoopla about battery life, absolutely. I think they're going to, it's going to be faster. Whatever
[00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:44.760]   version it's going to be, so a MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, MacBook standard out of nowhere,
[00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:51.880]   it's going to be faster. They're going to impress us with these numbers. They wouldn't do it without
[00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:56.840]   being able to be faster than the previous version. So that's definitely going to be in there. It's
[00:27:56.840 --> 00:28:04.360]   not going to look any different. Maybe you'll get a color change, but I think it's going to look
[00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:08.840]   exactly like the previous version. So, Leo, you're going to be a little disappointed that it doesn't
[00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:12.440]   have like a brand new visual aspect to it. I know, well, I think we're going to have-
[00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:18.680]   I think we're going to have- So I know it's just which. I think it's going to have the touch bar.
[00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:22.840]   I think that's going to be an option. They have not gotten rid of the touch bar, even though-
[00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:25.800]   But a MacBook Air doesn't have a touch bar. Now you think even an Air would have a touch bar?
[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:29.800]   No, I think if it were the Pro. It would have a touch bar.
[00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:33.320]   And I think across the board, it'll be a touch ID though, I believe.
[00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:37.000]   Yeah, I love that on the ear. That's just all I want. I don't need any more than that.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:41.960]   Just the fingerprint readers. All I really need. And do you think it'll perform better
[00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:48.760]   than their commensurate Intel products? Or will they be satisfied with parity and better battery life?
[00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:54.280]   I don't think they would do this if they couldn't prove that it was faster and better. I really
[00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:59.960]   think that they would just keep- They would wait. This is it. They want to prove that Apple
[00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:06.360]   Silicon is better than Intel Silicon. So they're going to make sure that it does better. It might
[00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:13.480]   not be a significant upgrade. It might be 10% better. Usually when they come out with these numbers,
[00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:20.200]   they try to max it out like 30% faster than last year's model. It may not reach that.
[00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:23.960]   But I think it's going to be an improvement, even if it is just a little bit.
[00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:29.800]   Wouldn't it be too hard to improve on the MacBook Air, which is hobbled by the kind of low end
[00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:34.680]   Intel processors? What do you think, any better, faster, longer battery life?
[00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:41.640]   Certainly longer battery life. The thing that I'm most looking forward to of all of this
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:48.200]   announcement is the ability to manage heat so well and manage power so well that we can finally get
[00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:54.760]   a MacBook nothing or a MacBook Air style machine that is as attractive as a lot of these super,
[00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:59.080]   super slim Windows machines that we have that are again kind of hamstrung because they're not
[00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:03.880]   running custom silicon only in the last year or so has there been any real movement towards
[00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:08.200]   okay Intel. Thank you very much. We will keep your resume on file. We are now going to have to
[00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:12.840]   design our own platform because we can't make the machines we want to make. I've always wanted
[00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:17.960]   something that would have the even that super flat keyboard. It would be such a perfect solution
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:23.400]   for something that is essentially a iPad Pro with a hinge and one of those super flat keyboards.
[00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:29.000]   I would love love love that. So that's what I'm looking for. I would be hoping for at least 14 to
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:33.720]   15 to 16 hours of battery life on a mobile device. That would be the sort of thing that gets
[00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:39.480]   people's fingers twitching over that by it now button especially also suppressing that what if I
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:46.520]   can't run this one app that I really need to run button as far and I agree with all day battery life
[00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:51.240]   to your bingo cards kids right for that's that's yeah because again that's the thing with either
[00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:56.120]   we all we love talking about things like oh well they're using this new di technology oh they're
[00:30:56.120 --> 00:31:02.520]   using this new style of RAM for for communications across the bus between the CPU what what really
[00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:09.240]   gets people going is by the way if you now you can take photos in almost near darkness that is oh
[00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:13.320]   that's something that I understand that's a problem that I've been encountering now you can get now
[00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:18.920]   you can get the same sort of all day battery life on your laptop as you can on your tablet again
[00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:23.080]   that's that's a problem that people are confronting that's something that will really really respond
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:28.440]   to people but I just to finish up I think that I think that Lori's right that I don't think I
[00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:33.080]   don't necessarily think that performance is going to be the highest on apples priority list for this
[00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:39.400]   first round however they really need to have an authoritative win here they can't they can't allow
[00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:44.200]   anybody to excuse me anybody who's not a bozo who takes a look at this and offers their opinion
[00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:49.080]   to say yeah but you know you're trading off performance or you're trading off you won't be able to use
[00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:55.880]   this kind of an accessory with it I think that so long as they can they can say that no we said our
[00:31:55.880 --> 00:32:00.920]   again I oftentimes I think in terms of what do they want to put into the slide deck what do they
[00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:06.600]   want to put into the into the script for the presentation and I can see that line and not only
[00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:13.640]   is it just as fast as Intel Silicon it is wipe dissolved 30 percent faster than the equivalent
[00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:19.240]   hardware we would be designing on Intel so yeah I would expect a speed bump but nothing that is
[00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:27.400]   actually shocking wrath of God style speed so and all day better life 30 percent faster to your
[00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:36.600]   your bingo card yeah I'd be happy with that what about GPUs Renee no more AMD it entirely or
[00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:44.440]   is Apple are apples GPUs good enough so if we look at the ones that were rumored first the 13 inch
[00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:50.440]   MacBook Air and 13 inch MacBook Pro they don't have discrete GPUs they have Intel embedded GPUs
[00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:56.440]   and while Intel is trying their embedded GPUs they are nothing like to write home about yeah
[00:32:56.440 --> 00:33:01.160]   compared to what I mentioned not these in the code so yeah although those are like for the
[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:05.160]   discrete GPUs that you'd find in the Mac Pro or the iMac or so that might even the Mac Pro you
[00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:12.600]   think that might be a possibility in a Mac Pro I don't know if the apple was very clear when
[00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:16.520]   Johnny Saruji announced the transition that they were going to be using so sees a family of so
[00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:20.200]   systems on a chip so that's so it's not like a buffet where there's like a bunch of different
[00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:25.240]   yeah it's like it's a sandwich yeah where like maybe the ram won't be on the so see because they've
[00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:31.080]   done separate ram on on iPads before like an offboard ram module but this is where I have so
[00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:36.600]   many questions like it's universal memory the GPU and his epu shares memory and that's fine when
[00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:42.440]   you go to a certain size but if you want to advertise 64 gigabytes or a terabyte of ram like is that
[00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:47.480]   is that really an SOC model or do you have some brilliant or horrible way of like segregating
[00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:52.680]   some of the ram off just for the CPU like on one side like technical Rene is super interested in
[00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:58.520]   the implementation details but like someone who needs to get work done Rene like who just needs
[00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:03.320]   final cut because I hate benchmarks what I like is time to complete it work right me ingesting
[00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:08.600]   footage to uploading my video right make that faster and I think yeah yeah and I think that's
[00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:11.960]   what apple's gonna focus on because they're very good at not talking about things that make some
[00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:16.280]   look bad and really good at talking about things that make some look good and I think they they
[00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:20.680]   will avoid direct comparisons by showing the advantage of the integrated model like they're
[00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:25.560]   making everything from the silicon to the apps for final cut and for logic and all of that and
[00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:30.200]   that'll just be a massive accelerator like it doesn't have to be as for general computing I don't
[00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:34.920]   know if it'll be faster than Intel uneven enough they'll talk about general computing I think they'll
[00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:39.400]   talk about hypervisor and emulation and how fast that is and then I think they'll talk about just
[00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:44.520]   how fast it can run dedicated Mac apps and that's faster than anything else in the world it's
[00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:50.520]   almost like the power PC to Intel comparison in the past is just we're picking we're picking our
[00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:58.040]   race and we're the winners and that race yeah jumper in the chat room says will the GPU be based on
[00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:05.960]   arms molly molly uh designed but have they don't they do their own gps no yeah it was imagination
[00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:11.320]   and now it's yeah everything the neural engine cores are custom they got a really good team now
[00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:17.400]   what about here's a thought lte what about or even 5g hey Verizon can give them some more money
[00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:24.440]   what about 5g in these things expensive no because they still have to go to Qualcomm if you're
[00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:31.400]   gonna do that maybe down the road on retail for a three thousand dollar computer it's 120 bucks
[00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:37.960]   for an iPad it would be on a three thousand right right but I don't know it depends on how fast 5g
[00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:47.080]   becomes a real thing there how many people are buying the the LTE based iPads versus say oh I got
[00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:52.840]   an iPhone I use that as a hotspot there's something about having the modem actually inside the device
[00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:57.800]   where you open the lid and you're simply connected to the internet that is that's not one of those
[00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:03.080]   things where wow that's a feature that I will pay 150 dollars for because it is a practical benefit
[00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:08.360]   it's but an apple can also sell it as kind of like the way that Verizon has been trying to sell this
[00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:12.840]   as a security feature actually I'm sorry no actually apple did sell this as a security feature thing
[00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:17.960]   and no you no longer have to try to trust Wi-Fi hotspots things have reasons amazing m&wave
[00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:22.200]   connectivity so yeah I could definitely see them offering that as an option
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:27.720]   although you're right that the I'm not sure if that will have that might have to wait until
[00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:33.560]   apple is confident they can build their own 5g chips and not have to cut out a cut to Qualcomm
[00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:40.840]   and spend that extra money for for for that license there's also like a much higher expectation for
[00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:49.480]   working on your computer and you know 5g isn't really that great right now in the wild that I guess
[00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:55.880]   as a general everywhere kind of thing and if apple is gonna have this thing that has 5g
[00:36:55.880 --> 00:37:01.720]   support but it's not very good people are gonna be really upset that they don't have a better
[00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:06.040]   user experience so I don't think apple is gonna do something like this right now I think they're
[00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:10.920]   gonna wait until the infrastructure is better before they add something like that because they
[00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:15.640]   want to make sure that the user experience doesn't negatively affect the product itself because
[00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:21.160]   people are gonna say my mac rent so slow they're not gonna say it's the 5g network you know so they
[00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:28.920]   they're gonna wait battery life was good yeah although although just I totally agree with you
[00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:34.200]   if I will however note that apple was I think the first major manufacturer to go all in on Wi-Fi
[00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:39.240]   even when Wi-Fi before Wi-Fi was the thing I think I did they actually also introduced the
[00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:43.640]   base stations at that point so you could have your entire solution side your inside your office
[00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:48.200]   but that's but that was all that was the jobs era that was a long time ago it's a totally different
[00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:54.040]   world totally different apple so they're very fast for Wi-Fi like they got Wi-Fi 6 immediately
[00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:58.760]   and then not fly like they seem to really embrace Wi-Fi technologies rapidly and be really
[00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:06.120]   conservative about cellular technologies yeah i'm excited i love to see those you great
[00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:11.880]   you never have to worry about it i'm gonna polish up my checkbook Leo what do you want to see
[00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:17.720]   what do you expect well there's what I want to see and what I expect is very different right
[00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:26.600]   true i did want a matte black 16 inch matte pro but anti-black you know i do have to you have
[00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:31.000]   added black exactly yeah i do have to point out well pacific blue might be a second check i do
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:37.880]   have to point out that for remember when the i9 16 inch came out and the guy had to put it in the
[00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:46.600]   freezer that really performance has been so thermally limited on all Intel laptops from all
[00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:53.160]   manufacturers for the last few years that may be just a cooler operating arm chip can operate at
[00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:58.040]   a much faster clock speed and give us really great performance just because of that just because
[00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:05.080]   it's cooler so i i'm i'm i think i'm i think we're gonna see i like all day battery life 30%
[00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:09.080]   better you better darn well not have a butterfly keyboard on it
[00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:17.400]   so do we put 50% cooler on our bingo card yeah do you think they'll say that
[00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:23.880]   oh no the pre-war draw right 50 like both am cooler it's also runs at lower temperatures yeah
[00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:29.560]   it's 100% cooler but it's also running at lower temperatures and the end in video at 200 to 300
[00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:34.040]   watts and apples been at six watts yeah they have a lot of room it's five nanometers too i mean
[00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:39.320]   there's a lot of reasons why this is going to be better i guess if you took my existing which i'm
[00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:46.600]   very happy with 20 i think it's 2019 or 2020 it is it's 20 oh macbook air is 2019 2019
[00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:50.920]   20 no there's one from march wasn't yeah i think i got the one in this in the most recent one yeah
[00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:56.040]   the spring macbook air if you took that i can't even tell what's happening this year anymore i know i
[00:39:56.040 --> 00:40:02.200]   know i know yeah march seems like it was about 10 years ago so i can understand people's confusion
[00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:10.200]   so if you take this whatever it is latest model macbook air and just put apple silicon in it and
[00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:15.800]   it were all boy all day battery life fantastic already got good battery life but all day
[00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:21.080]   you know i just don't have to plug it into like at home at night that's awesome
[00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:26.520]   and i think if it's 30 percent yeah all day battery life 30 percent faster i'd be happy
[00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:32.680]   i'd be very that that would live up to all my expectations compatibility is going to be a big
[00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:40.120]   question mark because i would love to take what's on my macbook air and move it over but will i
[00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:46.120]   remember apple apple made there's there's three different things that apple is doing to help with
[00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:52.200]   the mac with the apple silicon transition so there's um you know developers can make the
[00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:58.840]   transition on their end and then there's the language that will into this resettitude resettitude and uh
[00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:04.680]   but the third one i can't remember it will work it will work i'm not i'm not actually that's the
[00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:07.960]   wrong question it's not that they won't work on me some kernel extensions might not because a big
[00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:14.520]   sir but it will work but will it work well will work tolerably i would like every application
[00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:19.080]   to run at least as well as it does on my mac current macbook air right if if everything that
[00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:24.360]   runs that that's the baseline and then some things like logic or final cut or i movie or
[00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:30.520]   work i works or whatever run a 30 percent faster that's pretty good and then as developers do slowly
[00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:35.880]   recompile with xcode we start to gain that benefit and you know here's one more thing
[00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:41.400]   speak it one more thing and oh by the way i'd love to take a couple of my
[00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:49.160]   ios apps and install them on that thing yeah i'm sure that would be a case i mean well
[00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:55.400]   well they promised to the games you know the games pokemon go yeah oh i wish somebody to make a
[00:41:55.400 --> 00:42:00.840]   switch emulator so i could run animal crossing on my computer oh man i'd never walk away from my
[00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:06.520]   computer couldn't animal crossing be better on an ipad pro wouldn't it really nintendo go on
[00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:11.720]   there was that story i don't uh panzerino was talking about these game controllers that mr
[00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:16.520]   beast and a bunch of other gamers are backing all i could do was look at it and say i would love
[00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:21.560]   so much for nintendo and sega to make those kinds of controllers that are bundled with their class
[00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:25.560]   not modern games they're classic games and just let me get those controllers and use them on ios
[00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:30.600]   ipad os and tvos and play those bundle games all day yeah i would be so happy oh
[00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:35.080]   just animal crossing that's all i really need
[00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:43.320]   laurie do you still play that oh yeah definitely how uh have you started with the fall with oh yeah
[00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:49.320]   i did all the pumpkins i did the i did the um yeah and uh so we had we had a nice halloween right it was
[00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:55.480]   nice mm-hmm the jack pumpkin came around and gave us all walley pops and candy and i have so many
[00:42:55.480 --> 00:43:00.760]   pumpkins he kept giving me pumpkins i don't want i want any more pumpkins and then and then uh yeah i
[00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:07.400]   made a fall mobile i made that mobile and hanging over my bed i'm collecting mushrooms now because
[00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:12.600]   there's some pretty good mushroom recipes out there yeah so i finally discovered scuba diving so
[00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:18.760]   that's a lot of fun oh yeah yeah a lot of fun swimming around yeah i have i was a panel i
[00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:22.280]   understand and invited a hundred people over and told not to take any social media pictures but
[00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:29.320]   they did and now they're setting down my water sorry that was pally dinner let's go let's go life
[00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:35.720]   in mudtery all uh i'm just bitter that the influencers keep having these outbreak parties i know i
[00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:41.720]   know i know it's terrible like well welcome to welcome to our world um i do have uh i have some
[00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:49.320]   neighbors the able sisters have not yet moved in with their sewing machines um they'll get there
[00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:55.400]   finally upgrading the a town uh desk the reception desk they're finally upgrading that that'll be
[00:43:55.400 --> 00:44:00.760]   exciting i have a beautiful museum by the way i've been i was just about to ask well i know you had
[00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:06.680]   a museum contributing to the museum like crazy yeah do you get lost in the museum
[00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:13.000]   yeah it's really easy to get lost in yeah it can get the more stuff you put in there the more
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:17.240]   confusing it gets to like when you go into the atrium it gets a little bit intense when you start
[00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:22.840]   having more things in there we'll have more with animal crossing new horizons uh the podcast in just
[00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:30.200]   a bit but i've been dying to talk to anybody somebody about you know i realize this is dangerous because
[00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:37.480]   my it started with farmville then we rule right i was really addicted to these kind of um
[00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:41.960]   you know you build up a town you want to have a bigger house than the rest of us we really get it
[00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:47.480]   simpsons tapped out this is very much along those lines i could well the good news is there's
[00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:51.240]   no in-app purchases there's no yeah there's yeah you're not going to spend thousands of
[00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:55.320]   dollars on this game because there's no there's no way to get that stuff with cash you have to
[00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:59.880]   just turn it they should really have a cash they would have made a lot they would have they've
[00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:03.960]   passed a billions of it so much and remote raid passes i don't want any more in-app purchases
[00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:10.360]   this is replaced pokemon go for me rene i'm sorry to say oh you should it's cheaper yeah it's
[00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:16.600]   free it's 30 i had to buy a three-dollar switch theoretically that would use for other things if
[00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:21.480]   anybody could pry it out of my hands and uh 30 dollars for the program and that's it i'm done
[00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:26.840]   yep thank you don't think don't look at us as a game platform think of it as a as a battery
[00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:32.680]   extender for your phone you know yeah you know it really you know it really is uh it's kind of
[00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:37.000]   pathetic and i realize why it's popular it's probably japanese because they have small apartments
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:41.480]   they don't have it's really all of the energy that you would put into decorating your real house
[00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:48.360]   and your real environs you put into this virtual thing right yeah yeah paint the walls
[00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:55.320]   yeah there was a terrific video on polygon where david uh brine gilbert who's just brilliant uh used
[00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:59.560]   one of the emulators to make his life better and he would just follow the character as a way to test
[00:45:59.560 --> 00:46:03.320]   how to make his life better but the character kept starving to death in two days oh so but it would
[00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:10.200]   but but it's a nice thing about animal crossing there's no death it's very it's very pleasant
[00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:15.240]   have you been bit by tarantula yet though no i got stung by wasps a few times until i figure out how
[00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:22.600]   to stop that the turnips you know about the turnips oh yeah the stall i read i'm more leo
[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:29.480]   the stall market so okay i got a question because i bought some turnips they were 109 each
[00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:36.680]   but the stock the price the stock stock price goes up and down i thought oh i'll just wait a
[00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:39.480]   little saturday and sell them but you kind of have to time it is there any way to know
[00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:46.840]   there's some amazing um actually i'm gonna make your life so much better or so much worse right now
[00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:53.560]   but there's a stalk market app or something there is so i use an app called animal crossing travel
[00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:57.960]   guide oh jeez you can find it in the app store so maybe that's my pick of the week this week for you
[00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:06.760]   not only does it it's it's in it incorporates another service that is called um the uh let me
[00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:12.360]   say i want to make sure i get the name of it yeah um oh i think it's called turnip profit so turnip profit
[00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:19.080]   program that is within the travel guide and so when you use turnip profit so you don't have to
[00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:23.000]   have the travel guide but i i really think you should get it because you can track all of your
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:28.680]   the collections things that you're collecting bugs and all that stuff too so it's really really
[00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:36.680]   good so here's the uh here's what i've been using the ANC AC&H turnip calculator that's it looks like
[00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:43.880]   it's using the same data so what that's doing is it's giving you an estimate based on last week
[00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:51.080]   it's based on last week based on last week yeah and based on what you paid for it yeah and it
[00:47:51.080 --> 00:48:00.360]   estimates and it's it's pretty darn good it estimates the predicted highest value of your turnip so
[00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:06.200]   you know i think what is it saying it's saying that Wednesday morning looks like it's it might
[00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:12.040]   be your high high this is beautiful this is pretty surprising this is so amazing is this amazing i
[00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:20.360]   can't even believe and this is translated into 20 different languages but we can't get messages on
[00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:27.240]   android i i ask you i ask you are people who are are like they're doing it for the love of the
[00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:32.520]   game they're obsessed they don't charge money for most of these things or if they do it's more of
[00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:37.560]   like hey if you want to donate it's pretty amazing the the work that goes into that kind of stuff
[00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:42.600]   is really good i can i say that i i got it by a switch now because this is like the third or
[00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:47.240]   fourth year in a row that i i'm the only one who's like not a real gamer and every time i love
[00:48:47.240 --> 00:48:51.240]   listening to you guys talk about like how much you're enjoying games but i always feel like i'm in
[00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:56.520]   i'm in the house listening to like the kids outside playing stick ball but my mom says no no you have
[00:48:56.520 --> 00:49:03.960]   your hammer dulcem or lesson in two days practice actually i have a marimba in my house so uh but if
[00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:09.400]   there ever is a hammer dulcem or i'll get it for you and we should we should do it it'd be cool we
[00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:14.120]   could we could FaceTime it i finally got a music room lorry so i'm putting my electric guitar my amp
[00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:19.400]   and my my marimba in there and people would think that i actually have a music room but i don't have
[00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:24.600]   you have you actually tried it's a virtual playing them to have you yeah you could play the marimba
[00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:31.400]   yeah yeah yeah it's pretty great some pretty awesome fun things in there i just i just i just
[00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:35.880]   got my keyboard out of storage and i'm playing again after like not playing for like five or six
[00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:40.440]   years because yes we're at that stage in social isolation where it's like what else do i have in
[00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:44.920]   my closet i used to enjoy but kind of forgot about that should probably pick up a good guess i think
[00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:50.280]   that's the problem with this game is always going to be associated with covid 19th i just probably
[00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:58.040]   not a good good association lorry will talk we'll talk i need to get everything you know i need it
[00:49:58.040 --> 00:50:04.280]   and apparently anthony nelson is also a player in our uh because he go if you got the able sisters
[00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:09.720]   you can get a twit hoodie he's put a twit hoodie in the oh oh oh cute yeah tell him to put up his um
[00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:14.600]   put up the the code for it and i'll go grab it in the store uh yeah put it in a slack and i'll
[00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:22.840]   tell everybody at the end of the show anthony our show what i realized because i'm unread it
[00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:27.560]   and i joined of course the animal crossing subreddit what i realized is there's all these people in the
[00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:34.520]   animal crossing subreddit posting their costumes because they dressed up as characters from from
[00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:41.160]   animal crossing and to a person the lament is nobody knew who i was but i really enjoyed making the
[00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:49.160]   costume because it's of and so i realized we've actually the world has entered this new phase
[00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:56.600]   where everybody is in hyper narrow niches that do not interconnect it used to be and when i was
[00:50:56.600 --> 00:51:01.560]   growing up you watch johnny karson the next morning y'all talked about it not anymore
[00:51:02.120 --> 00:51:06.200]   no it's you gotta find lory and i find each other and we talk about animal crossing
[00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:11.320]   and he talks about his hammer dulcemer rene he i don't know what he's talking about something about
[00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:18.600]   parties and i don't know did that actually happen in a lot of video codecs no it wasn't in
[00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:23.000]   mntrell it was in los angeles it was a bunch of a bunch of influencers who wanted to have a 100
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:27.720]   person party without anybody finding out so they said please come please take photos but don't
[00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:31.080]   post any of them so of course everybody posted pictures of the signs and don't post the pictures
[00:51:31.080 --> 00:51:36.840]   and then they all got caught good that's fair we're good we're seeing such a great
[00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:41.400]   test of social influencing because now this is like the third or fourth time in recent memory that
[00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:46.360]   uh like in boston they had to go back they had to go back down to like no in-person
[00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:52.760]   classes and specifically because because this person had a halloween party with 40 people in it
[00:51:52.760 --> 00:52:01.080]   and it caused a micro spread and now thanks to you joshua k wilson shaming it up circle drive and
[00:52:01.080 --> 00:52:07.320]   madapan but you know what no one complains that they're shaming him do they we're all just as angry
[00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:11.880]   it's something to do it's something to do shaming people it's something to do normally when we do
[00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:16.600]   an ad for a product i have the product in hand i could say i've been using it this is not an
[00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:24.360]   example of that but it i cannot wait to get the new peak design mobile i've already ordered i
[00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:30.200]   and i ended up ordering the whole kitten kaboodle peak design i'm a huge fan i do have almost all
[00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:35.320]   their other products the last kickstarter they did this is their tenth kickstarter campaign last
[00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:40.440]   one they did the travel tripod i fell in love with i bought i love it it's my best tripod i have
[00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:47.080]   peak designs camera straps peep design bags peak design a tripod heads everything it's all peak
[00:52:47.080 --> 00:52:54.600]   design all the time now they're getting into mobile and i cannot wait it's an ecosystem of cases
[00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:59.720]   mounts and accessories to make your iphone or any phone a better tool for everything you do
[00:52:59.720 --> 00:53:04.680]   from photo and video creation to bicycle and motorcycle riding to working in the house or the
[00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:10.520]   office in their words you don't need more screen time you need better screen time it even works
[00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:18.200]   with the new iphone 12 magsafe system so it starts with the case the case has this proprietary
[00:53:18.200 --> 00:53:24.040]   magnetic mechanical locking system built into it they call it slim link it's a machined precision
[00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:30.920]   machined beautiful piece of zirconia ceramic and it's got an array of magnets strong magnets
[00:53:30.920 --> 00:53:36.520]   in there strong enough to give you an intuitive no look connection just like magsafe but even
[00:53:36.520 --> 00:53:41.960]   stronger it also supports magsafe so you get the wireless charging compatibility and when you're
[00:53:41.960 --> 00:53:49.400]   out there on a motorcycle or bouncing around it's got a hard locking mechanism to twist it and it's
[00:53:49.400 --> 00:53:54.920]   never going to come off until you let it off and that's the strength of this slim link system
[00:53:55.800 --> 00:54:02.600]   very easy to attach but also very very solid for the times you need it and they've put that into
[00:54:02.600 --> 00:54:08.520]   this everyday phone case which is beautiful it's slim gives you great protection and when paired
[00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:12.840]   to your mobile device opens up their incredible ecosystem of mounts and accessories i said as i

[00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:58.840]   you're going down the freeway there so i will i will absolutely get that uh you get there's a
[00:54:58.840 --> 00:55:05.000]   charging stand for your desk or bedside table got that there's low i got two low profile wall mounts
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:08.600]   you can put it like in the kitchen or then you're wherever you're going to just want the phone on
[00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:13.640]   the wall there so you can see it uh and then you get a kit of adapters or you can get a kit of

[00:57:20.440 --> 00:57:27.880]   an hour early eight a.m. pacific 11 a.m. eastern time uh the apple event is at 10 a.m. so we'll finish
[00:57:27.880 --> 00:57:35.080]   ios today mica and i will do our you know clicking clack watching the show talking about it a bit
[00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:42.280]   and then uh we will then immediately after probably given apple's discipline i would imagine on time
[00:57:42.280 --> 00:57:49.080]   at 11 a.m pacific 2 p.m. eastern go to mac break weekly next week uh unfortunately laurie and rene
[00:57:49.080 --> 00:57:55.320]   will be busy doing something i don't know uh but andy and i will be here and we'll get you know
[00:57:55.320 --> 00:58:00.360]   we'll get dr rock back at doc rock or you know we'll get some people in uh it gives you know it's
[00:58:00.360 --> 00:58:04.760]   nice it gives them a chance to say something uh because i know you guys will come back the following
[00:58:04.760 --> 00:58:10.920]   week with lots more information i'm i'm really excited and uh do we think it's only apple silicon
[00:58:10.920 --> 00:58:15.640]   or is there does anyone think they'll be an outside chance for air tags or air pod studio or some
[00:58:15.640 --> 00:58:20.600]   something that goes with it like we had apple watch and ipad and then home pod mini and iphone what
[00:58:20.600 --> 00:58:29.880]   we have accessory plus apple silicon i think we're gonna see apple tags really i do i do i do i think
[00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:34.280]   there's all these rumors that say that it was postponed but i think this is it i think this is
[00:58:34.280 --> 00:58:41.320]   this is the time because now everybody has the new iphones um it's probably ready to go i mean
[00:58:41.320 --> 00:58:46.040]   it's been so close to ready to go for so long that it's hard to imagine that that there's any reason
[00:58:46.040 --> 00:58:50.360]   why they're holding off any longer so i think that we're gonna see air tags i don't think we're
[00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:55.640]   gonna see the home pod studio though i think that one's still on on the the waitlist until next year
[00:58:55.640 --> 00:59:01.240]   maybe isn't it risky to dilute the announcement with something that's kind of unre completely
[00:59:01.240 --> 00:59:08.520]   unrelated like home pod mini and iphone well that's true yeah i think that was the theory thing yeah
[00:59:08.520 --> 00:59:14.680]   like if the air tags are ready they should have done it last on the last one yeah but maybe they
[00:59:14.680 --> 00:59:20.040]   weren't ready and maybe um you know they wanted to announce home pod mini at that time and they
[00:59:20.040 --> 00:59:25.800]   wanted to kind of parse out the the and the things that they've added to it so you know i
[00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:30.680]   think there'll be one more thing with the one more thing like yeah here's another one more thing
[00:59:30.680 --> 00:59:36.680]   i think and i think it's gonna be air tags all right i do yeah i'm gonna put my 50 cents on that one
[00:59:36.680 --> 00:59:41.160]   okay get that bingo card ready air tags yeah i learned never to bet against lory
[00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:46.520]   yeah no she's she's clearly got a good intuition yeah what's my percentage here
[00:59:47.320 --> 00:59:54.440]   like what's my score you get 50 cents uh gosh i don't i don't i'd be willing to take that bet because
[00:59:54.440 --> 00:59:58.600]   i i just feel like they're not going to want to mush those two products together on the other
[00:59:58.600 --> 01:00:03.640]   hand apple doesn't care anymore do they they just you know here's what we got and when else are they
[01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:08.360]   gonna announce it though right you know if it wasn't gonna be at the iphone event next march yeah they'd
[01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:14.600]   have to wait till yeah so i think i think it makes a lot of sense and and they're not going to just
[01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:19.240]   like drop that out of nowhere with just a press release because it's a brand new product so
[01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:25.720]   i think we're gonna see it soon they did it did roll out apple one without even a press release
[01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:30.360]   i know that was out of nowhere was yeah but they did talk about it at the end of the
[01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:35.640]   analyst call but that's not that's no i mean but they had they had an event where they talked
[01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:39.320]   all about apple one so they didn't need to talk about it anymore yeah back in it's a
[01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:43.960]   september event so they'd already covered it this was just it's finally available yeah that's true
[01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:50.040]   put out a press release at least yeah they just it was like they announced it i mean i guess
[01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:54.520]   technically it was announced before the earnings call but it was it was just kind of like talked
[01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:59.080]   about in the earnings call as if it's like it's coming out tomorrow yeah tomorrow is happening
[01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:05.640]   tomorrow no big deal no big deal yeah and by the way not easy to find i so i heard that and i said
[01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:11.000]   oh that was yesterday so today it's out where is it so you have to dig into your settings
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:18.600]   click your apple account you know your click your head and then in subscriptions there was a banner
[01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:22.120]   saying hey you want apple one i said okay yeah i'll take it he did a staged push like i didn't think
[01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:26.440]   i don't think they wanted to push like everybody immediately so you let like the nerds go find it
[01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:31.480]   first and then they casually started alerting people for the next week i have a question for you
[01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:43.640]   or laurie uh that was came up on uh uh ios today because i have apples itunes match obviously apple
[01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:47.960]   music is going to be folded into apple i got the whole kitten kaboodle right because it's family
[01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:53.560]   five other people i'm gonna you know have all that to terabytes of yeah that's if you have seven
[01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:58.360]   people in your family how do you pick like how do you pick you just get to look i'm sorry you just
[01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:05.240]   don't make the cut sorry gamma sorry so you can sorry i at first i thought they weren't gonna
[01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:10.920]   cancel your iCloud subscription because i had two terabyte iCloud subscription
[01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:15.480]   but they rolled that right in but apparently you can add another separate two terabytes if you want
[01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:23.640]   four yeah uh obviously there's no point in having two apple you know music subscriptions or
[01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:30.600]   news plus or anything like that so i think it's a pretty good deal uh i decided to go for it
[01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:36.120]   um but my question for you is i actually either my questions for you is iTunes match
[01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:40.760]   yeah i thought it should i cancel that can i cancel that what would i
[01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:46.120]   be losing so the last time i asked because i've been worried about this too is apple music
[01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:50.440]   includes iTunes match so if you're all in on apple music you don't need the separate iTunes
[01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:55.960]   match except you're not sure about apple music and you ever want to cancel it you can lose everything
[01:02:55.960 --> 01:03:00.360]   so i keep it around it's sort of like i've had apple music for like four years now you know
[01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:04.200]   clearly like i'm clearly staying with it but i'm still like nope it's my safety belt what i
[01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:10.920]   do so the stuff i uploaded and i uploaded a ton of stuff yeah if i canceled apple music would that
[01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:15.960]   be gone no if you kept iTunes match my understanding is no you would just go back to being iTunes match
[01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:20.120]   instead of having all the apple music so before you cancel iTunes match you should it would behoove
[01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:25.880]   you to download everything that's uploaded and put that somewhere safe because if you ever
[01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:31.560]   decided to cancel apple music you're gonna lose it all right yeah although you could probably do
[01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:36.520]   that at any time i don't need i don't know if you need to do that before you cancel okay match okay
[01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:41.640]   so okay it's it's more complicated than it would be i guess because there are edge cases where people
[01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:47.880]   right want one not the other right i'm sorry i got sidetracked so there that's apple one
[01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:53.960]   let's talk about the quarterly results because because it we it was another thing that happened
[01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:59.320]   this week uh lory knows them intimately lory lory sat and listened that call yeah you've been
[01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:05.800]   busy it's it's been a crazy week all right did you uh transcribe but did you have to transcribe
[01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:11.160]   oh i'm sorry i'm so sorry i actually this was an interesting one this time around honestly
[01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:15.720]   what was interesting about it besides the fact that it was once again a record quarter
[01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:24.600]   so well one of the things that i i could i could sense about the way they were talking was that
[01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:30.760]   they seemed to be kind of more on the defense like the questions that were presented to them in the
[01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:37.480]   analyst um in the in the analyst uh q and a whatever you want to call that part of it um where the
[01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:45.800]   they were asking the questions it seemed like they felt compelled to defend the um the current
[01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:51.800]   state of things which the numbers speak for themselves that like we had a pandemic and
[01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:57.160]   the numbers have been really great but i think it's because the numbers looked a little bit down
[01:04:57.160 --> 01:05:03.640]   for iphone specifically um so they were constantly having to reiterate that that that they didn't get
[01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:08.360]   the the iphone into this quarter that it's not gonna that it's not showing up in this quarter
[01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:11.000]   cells it's gonna show the next quarter because it was a late right so i think that they
[01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:15.480]   yeah so they're i could just get it get a sense of it that they were trying to
[01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:22.200]   to say stop looking at that number because the phones aren't a part of this this conversation
[01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:26.840]   at all so right um so i'll just give you the top line here record revenue
[01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:35.480]   this is a for three months 64.7 billion dollars however as you pointed out iphone i know wow 20
[01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:42.360]   billion yeah um give or take a month uh that's revenue not profit but still nice revenue
[01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:47.000]   if you can get it uh iphone was down 20 percent year over year but that's because
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:54.200]   last year there were iphone new iphone sales iphone 11 sales this year very few so
[01:05:54.200 --> 01:06:00.040]   yeah that came out in September last year yeah so you'll see that more next quarter they'll get
[01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:03.800]   the benefit of it right well iphone next quarter is going to be record high what i thought was
[01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:09.960]   very interesting is mac revenue was up 29 percent year over year only nine billion it's not a huge
[01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:14.840]   portion of their income that kind of mirrors what's been happening in the pc world too and i think
[01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:19.960]   that there is a demand the people are working from home yep there's been a lot of sales of
[01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:28.600]   computers for work from home um so that makes i guess that makes sense ipad revenue up 46 percent
[01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:36.520]   wow remember when the ipad was just kind of home flat is that work from home also or maybe no i
[01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:44.680]   maybe more school from home i think a lot of kids using ipads just in place yeah yeah everything
[01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:51.320]   from home yeah right services revenue up up to 16 percent to 14 and a half billion although the
[01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:55.880]   little of the schluster from that has gone away because now that we know that google is paying
[01:06:55.880 --> 01:07:01.160]   between seven and twelve billion dollars a year as much as three billion dollars a quarter that's
[01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:05.720]   in that services revenue that is like well okay but some of that was just you know
[01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:11.880]   back she's from google to keep it in the search engine wearables revenue up 20 percent so
[01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:18.200]   i think if you're apple you feel pretty good about this but again thank you Jason snell six
[01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:24.520]   colors dot com this pie chart because iphone which used to be more than half of the revenue is now
[01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:32.600]   41 percent services 22 percent every this is this is that's a good looking diverse
[01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:40.680]   diverse pie chart i think for apple yeah yeah i agree um there's you know there's going to be or
[01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:46.360]   there were you know plenty of tech pundits who look at those iphone numbers or just the the general
[01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:53.720]   slow down and iphone sales not not just this year but even last year and apple just they just said
[01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:57.800]   okay we see the writing on the wall and we're going to make some changes to make sure that we
[01:07:57.800 --> 01:08:03.160]   are still hugely profitable and you look at that pie chart and you see how that spread out more
[01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:08.120]   broadly and that's exactly what they should be doing that you don't want to put all your aids
[01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:13.480]   it was dangerous for the iphone to have so much of their revenue category and now that it spread
[01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:18.200]   out a little bit more there in a very protective stage of you know iphone sales could drop
[01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:23.320]   significantly but it's clear that they're they're doing things to bring all of the other categories
[01:08:23.320 --> 01:08:28.840]   up and make those very profitable too so that any loss in iphone i don't know if you look at
[01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:35.320]   Jason Snell's chart down toward the bottom there was a huge drop in sales in china and so i think
[01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:39.960]   there was originally they were expecting this to be something that was going to continue to grow
[01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:45.880]   and grow and grow and they just saw a huge drop in this last quarter and this may not be permanent
[01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:52.120]   but for now it's it's a significant drop so the that's that's iphone you know that's that's where
[01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:57.880]   where we're seeing some losses in that so them kind of making sure that all of their other eggs
[01:08:57.880 --> 01:09:05.880]   are accounted for i think made a really great year for them overall for sure china uh
[01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:12.120]   some of that is patriotism right in response to tariffs to the the blocking of Huawei i think Huawei
[01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:17.960]   is is now the number one and number two phone company in the world because also just known
[01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:24.040]   new phones that which is bad in the Chinese market right yeah i mean we can applaud that
[01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:29.960]   pie chart it probably won't be quite so balanced next quarter with with iphone 12 sales i think
[01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:35.800]   lory has a really good point there that tim cook you know he is he is renowned for being a
[01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:41.320]   logistical genius but the way in which he's been able to position apple through all of this through
[01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:46.520]   huge ups and downs yeah they had to restate earnings once and he had to deal with saturation in the
[01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:52.040]   eye but just the way he's steadily moved apples businesses forward never sort of dragging anything
[01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:57.400]   but using everything as as a point to push off more things and building services on top and
[01:09:57.400 --> 01:10:03.160]   getting everything just glued together so it's really enticing to to buy into apple ecosystem
[01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:08.840]   writ larg i think it's going to be looked back as one of the best that wasn't one of cleverest eras
[01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:14.360]   of technology building of the last decade no one doubts at this point that the the emphasis on
[01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:20.360]   services was the right thing to do and the services growth is very steady quarter after quarter after
[01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:25.720]   quarter in fact the biggest and wearables which builds on iphone as well yeah yeah it's a it's a
[01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:33.640]   nice fly billion phones now it's a nice fly wheel um let's see let me i'm just going through the graphs
[01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:42.360]   total revenue as we mentioned 64.7 billion dollars not not a record revenue i mean uh those iphone
[01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:48.840]   quarters are better and that's probably what we'll see profit 12.7 billion dollars pretty good for a
[01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:54.520]   q4 uh it's one of those things though we're like if you had said like apple be having this
[01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:57.800]   revenue without the iphone a few years ago people would have thought you were mad right saying
[01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:02.120]   google would have record revenues without search or facebook would have it without advertising
[01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:07.400]   it's it's a pretty amazing ability to shore up your core business when that business isn't
[01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:12.040]   isn't aligned with massive earnings any particular quarter next quarter will be one of those peak
[01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:18.120]   quarters that we're seeing on this chart where it's uh you know that's the iphone quarter so it'll be
[01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:24.040]   interesting to see if you know how much iphone still is important to them revenue change only up a
[01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:29.400]   little bit uh this is the this is i think the most interesting one percentage revenue by product
[01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:35.400]   line and you can see the services and wearables and mac and ipad all growing ipad a little less
[01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:43.720]   but uh everything else growing and iphone instead of being you know 80% or 60% of the revenues
[01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:51.800]   really starting to be uh just a equal partner without hurting yeah overall revenue it's becoming
[01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:57.960]   the platform everything else is built off of which is a good position for it to be in now so uh
[01:11:57.960 --> 01:12:04.440]   anything else to glean you listened to the entire analyst call larry anything else from luka
[01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:09.240]   uh just the fact that apple one was just sort of dropped as if it was information everybody
[01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:15.480]   already knew about which was kind of a wonderful surprise yeah yeah did Tim said something like
[01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:23.320]   and we still have some exciting new yeah products they were they were very excited about you know
[01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:29.160]   some some more things to announce this year there was even though nothing was really spoken about
[01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:34.280]   it was interesting to hear tim cook kind of talk about the future the way they don't usually talk
[01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:39.480]   about the future which you know they still didn't but there was more excitement about the things
[01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:44.840]   to come which obviously i think they were able they felt able to say because they announced at
[01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:49.960]   wwdc that there was going to be a silicon mac before the end of the year so i'm sure that
[01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:55.720]   that was their their ability to kind of hint at that without actually having to say anything
[01:12:55.720 --> 01:13:03.480]   um but yeah that that was that was it but i really do think this was probably to me the most
[01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:09.160]   exciting um quarter for them just when you look at those numbers and you and you know what
[01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:14.360]   all what every company has gone through and their ability to weather this and and come out with
[01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:20.120]   such positive numbers after everything that's happened in 2020 i think is the kind of just it
[01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:25.560]   was really exciting to me and interesting to me to see that the only one they didn't have a clear
[01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:29.480]   answer to it would like an uncharacteristically unclear answer and i they must have been expecting
[01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:35.240]   the question is why why the pricing is so close now and the specs so close now on iphone 12 and
[01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:40.680]   iphone 12 pro and even ipad air and ipad pro and they were asked you know there's only 150
[01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:45.080]   bucks difference and it's so close and what's your strategy there and i would have thought they'd
[01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:50.600]   have a talking point just you know locked and loaded for that but really not much so they were
[01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:56.120]   asked about it but they didn't have anything to say yeah i'm sure there's some deep thinking
[01:13:56.120 --> 01:14:02.120]   going on in the company headquarters i think it's win win for them because people who want like the
[01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:07.160]   mid-range are paying a little bit more for it but seem okay with that but it's just such a small
[01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:12.120]   step up to the really nice version that some percentage of those people are looking at and going
[01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:16.760]   eh for 150 bucks i'll take i'll take the more memory in the bigger you know bigger capabilities
[01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:21.880]   and the better cameras it's only 150 bucks so it feels like win win but maybe it's uncouth to say that
[01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:26.840]   it's such a good marketing strategy for them to have that sort of thing they have the
[01:14:26.840 --> 01:14:33.880]   the really inexpensive entry level whatever and those are for people who really are on a type
[01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:41.560]   budget and then everything else is well i don't need the most expensive one i want more than the
[01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:46.680]   cheap one i'll take the middle one or well i could just spend a hundred fifty dollars more and get
[01:14:46.680 --> 01:14:51.080]   the more expensive one i think like from a marketing perspective they're doing exactly what they
[01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:58.360]   should be doing without like by not making the distance between the prices so much they're giving
[01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:05.320]   us the the consumer you know it's feeding that whatever that desire is going to be in us whether
[01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:11.160]   it's i don't need the most expensive one or it's only 150 more i'll get the most most expensive one
[01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:17.480]   i think it's it's probably psychological i think you're right it's that it's that uh
[01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:24.520]   predictably irrational kind of trick stuff that they're doing that and amplifies profits by
[01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:29.640]   getting you say it's only 150 bucks more i can afford that i'll do that
[01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:35.080]   all right we're gonna take a break come back there's lots more lory gill is here she's managing
[01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:41.960]   editor at imore which means you should hire somebody to do all that typing next time
[01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:46.680]   i know i know mica used to do it he's so glad he's not it
[01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:52.920]   rene richie he still writes for imore from time and time but he's also got his own youtube channel
[01:15:52.920 --> 01:16:00.440]   he's a youtube star youtube.com/rene richie and from wgbh in boston our very own andy and not
[01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:06.120]   co and not co.com did you take down the post-it note pumpkin my microphone is off

[01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:29.800]   but i get like well uh when you uh when next time next presidential debate you're in andrew will
[01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:34.760]   i make sure that no i'm sorry did you want what did you want to add about the results i apologize
[01:16:34.760 --> 01:16:39.240]   no no no i can't see your lips okay so i didn't know no not a problem uh
[01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:45.720]   not only only that uh you all said very very intelligent things uh almost all of which i
[01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:51.400]   probably wouldn't have agreed with uh so uh no worries and the pumpkin i have to take i have to
[01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:55.480]   clean up that corner my office just enough that i can take a really good clean picture before i
[01:16:55.480 --> 01:16:59.560]   take it down but i'm already i'm already designing the christmas post-it uh how excited
[01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:05.000]   but no christian his yes festive festive christmas post-its he's making some glitter glue
[01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:11.000]   no because i don't want to have glitter in my office until the end until three days after
[01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:17.160]   the second coming of jesus christ yeah okay that's the good thing yeah uh i have uh i some holly bushes
[01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:22.920]   in my animal crossing but i don't think i can get them to you in any way hey before we end the show
[01:17:22.920 --> 01:17:27.640]   you should give me your uh your address lory yeah yeah i can come visit your island because i want
[01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:32.520]   to see what a real mature island looks like mine's just well you'll be disappointed in mine because i
[01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:36.760]   don't actually do a lot of decorating i'm really hyper focused on the collecting of things so i
[01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:42.120]   don't spend as much time on the decorating do you go around every morning so i have a routine now i
[01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:48.440]   get up i water the pumpkins water the plants and then i go around and shake every single tree on mine
[01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:55.160]   do you do that i i used to shake every single tree on the island until more things started happening
[01:17:55.160 --> 01:18:00.600]   and then oh now you're busy it's because yeah it's become less important to me to shake trees for sure
[01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:05.240]   i could because i'm really getting sick of shaking trees so i i look forward to those days
[01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:12.600]   i apologize i'm sorry and there's you can cut all the animal crossing stuff out you really can
[01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:18.280]   make it a special make it a quick no that's a hot demographic i don't know we should we should
[01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:23.880]   be playing animal crossing while we talk about mac oh talk about numbers boy we played among us on

[01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:51.880]   organization and when they saw the need they said we can help as organizations adapt to the new
[01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:58.120]   normal it decision makers have a lot of um interesting challenges but think of it as an
[01:20:58.120 --> 01:21:03.640]   opportunity to take a fresh look at what you're investing in in technology right now
[01:21:03.640 --> 01:21:10.520]   wwt can help you reassess learn about solutions to create better experiences from everybody from

[01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:32.280]   cover the whole waterfront organizations can now begin to move from urgently responding to a need
[01:21:32.280 --> 01:21:37.720]   and scrambling to solve this to enhancing the experience of their remote workers maybe time
[01:21:37.720 --> 01:21:44.120]   to sit back step back think about this get some help from a real expert in telehealth they work
[01:21:44.120 --> 01:21:48.600]   with a lot of health care organizations they can help them rapidly connect with patients

[01:23:21.400 --> 01:23:27.960]   continuity and a great partner and really good people too i'm a big fan of the wwt team we had a
[01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:40.040]   lot of fun uh let's see here apple has a recall for the air pod pros any air pod pro made before
[01:23:40.040 --> 01:23:47.560]   october which i'm guessing is all of them if but you have to have the sound issues static or
[01:23:47.560 --> 01:23:52.680]   crackling noise it increases in loud environments problems with active noise cancellation my air
[01:23:52.680 --> 01:23:59.640]   pod pro does not have that if you any of you experienced this i have you have um mica did too mica's
[01:23:59.640 --> 01:24:09.160]   on his third set yeah that's frustrating yeah um mine isn't very bad it doesn't happen all the
[01:24:09.160 --> 01:24:15.160]   time so it's one of those things that i've never really gone back to apple about because it's it's
[01:24:15.160 --> 01:24:18.920]   just every once in a while it almost sometimes makes me think like is my hair like
[01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:26.200]   yeah wrestling against yourself yeah but now that i know that the recall exists there i might
[01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:30.920]   take him in and have him replaced just because now i know that it's not just me that it actually
[01:24:30.920 --> 01:24:40.120]   is a thing so it will depend i guess on uh who you talk to there is a website um the apple pro
[01:24:40.120 --> 01:24:46.040]   air pods pro service program for sound issues they say they fix this in going forward so anything
[01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:53.560]   manufactured since october will be okay but you have to uh you have to take it in right find an
[01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:59.000]   apple authorized service provider or make an appointment at an apple retail store you can contact
[01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:03.400]   apple support it may be the case that if you call them on the phone and describe the situation
[01:25:03.400 --> 01:25:07.880]   they say yeah yeah find send it in but you but you somehow have to go through some screening
[01:25:08.600 --> 01:25:13.560]   uh and it does not extend the warranty coverage but uh i guess they will
[01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:18.440]   i can they repair them i bet not they'll probably replace them i would be
[01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:25.320]   guessing with newer ones yeah yeah that's what i think too i mean especially if we're talking about
[01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:29.800]   like what happened with with mica if they're just going to replace it with another pair that was
[01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:35.240]   manufactured prior to october 2020 then that person might end up going through the rigmarole
[01:25:35.240 --> 01:25:39.480]   over and over again i i haven't noticed anything now i'm wondering maybe you have just not paying
[01:25:39.480 --> 01:25:46.360]   attention well it might be depending on how often you wear them because like i wear my air
[01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:55.080]   pods a lot every single day and i i hear the crackle about maybe oh maybe twice a week it's
[01:25:55.080 --> 01:26:00.840]   once a week usually okay i i i get disconnects but i think it's it's kind of my fault it's like
[01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:05.880]   the phone decides oh no you can have it yo you can have it no you can have it they switch
[01:26:05.880 --> 01:26:11.000]   they switch have you ever had that happen this that's just a bluetooth issue i think yeah well
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:17.640]   especially now that um you with ios 14 you can switch between devices depending on what's playing
[01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:23.240]   so i think there's a little bit of you you might be listening to music on one thing and then
[01:26:23.240 --> 01:26:28.760]   watching a video on another thing and then suddenly your phone wants to switch over which is very
[01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:34.520]   annoying you know all of a sudden it's not yeah i just drives me nuts uh you remember dark sky
[01:26:34.520 --> 01:26:43.480]   apple bottom last march uh they are starting to integrate those features into the weather app in
[01:26:43.480 --> 01:26:52.360]   ios 14 uh believe it or not i'm actually kind of pleased they just updated the app so the dark sky
[01:26:52.360 --> 01:27:00.200]   yes yeah right they didn't get rid of it no uh dark sky version six point i deleted it i thought
[01:27:00.200 --> 01:27:04.360]   oh this dead it's gone so i'm gonna get it back because i think they screwed over the android
[01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:10.040]   people that's all the counts yeah take it take that you android people since we never had it outside
[01:27:10.040 --> 01:27:14.920]   of the u.s or the u.k i'm just not going to care about any oh you you never could have dark sky it
[01:27:14.920 --> 01:27:21.320]   was only the u.s in the u.k and ireland oh that's weird so what what kind of changes are we seeing
[01:27:21.320 --> 01:27:28.920]   in the weather app i'm glad you asked lory because i don't see any changes there's a new extra large
[01:27:28.920 --> 01:27:35.720]   watch complication if you have watch oa seven okay uh improved location search with more suggested
[01:27:35.720 --> 01:27:42.360]   and relevant results there's a new location icon to indicate when precise location has been disabled
[01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:48.360]   there's a fix for an issue that could cause a duplicate forecast page so it fixes some minor
[01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:59.000]   improvements um and now they have um added to the weather app not the dark sky app real time
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:03.400]   minute by minute precipitation readings so that was one of the things we loved about dark sky we
[01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:08.600]   would say you're gonna it's gonna rain in two minutes you just got a quarter inch uh so that'll
[01:28:08.600 --> 01:28:13.080]   now be in the apple weather app it also will support severe weather events and provide details on when
[01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:18.280]   there'll be a significant shift in weather coming up those features have been ported over from dark
[01:28:18.280 --> 01:28:22.600]   sky so i don't know maybe you didn't go stop the rain like did it work both ways to tell you that
[01:28:22.600 --> 01:28:28.680]   you can choose to stop it what would you like to do stop the rain encourage the rain i need more rain
[01:28:28.680 --> 01:28:37.480]   seed rain yeah dark sky does work on the ipad so there is one in dark sky yeah go ahead now that
[01:28:37.480 --> 01:28:45.400]   dark sky is folded into the weather app are you gonna see those kinds of of things in in canada or
[01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:50.040]   is it just gonna be expensive i do see it but i don't know like i've never heard anything official
[01:28:50.040 --> 01:28:53.640]   about it so i don't know if i'm getting because i often set my phones to the u.s anyway so i don't
[01:28:53.640 --> 01:28:57.800]   know if it's just like i'm close enough to the border that i'm getting some incremental version of it
[01:28:57.800 --> 01:29:02.200]   or if it's actually supported and i don't want to say anything because i might go oh oh that's not
[01:29:02.200 --> 01:29:11.880]   supposed to be working let's just turn that off i just i just reinstalled it that's nice it thinks
[01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:17.320]   i'm in plate raised national seashore but okay that's close to me that's where you want to be
[01:29:17.320 --> 01:29:24.040]   wish i were yeah oh no i found me it found me it was uh that's see that it switched from uh
[01:29:24.040 --> 01:29:29.640]   probably the cell towers a more general location to a much more accurate location oh dark sky i
[01:29:29.640 --> 01:29:39.560]   missed you yay oh just a boy in his app oh um apple walnut street is closed
[01:29:40.840 --> 01:29:47.000]   not because of covid 19 but because they're afraid they'll be rioting in philadelphia there
[01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:52.360]   was earlier this summer in fact the store hasn't been fully repaired from the summer's damage
[01:29:52.360 --> 01:29:59.400]   so this is happening all over the country today yeah in washington dc in new york city in san
[01:29:59.400 --> 01:30:07.240]   francisco a lot of stores boarded up and i guess apple's doing the same thing so that's too bad
[01:30:07.800 --> 01:30:13.560]   yeah hopefully yeah it's it's it's sad to see because it's also hard to know who they're boarding
[01:30:13.560 --> 01:30:19.800]   the windows against it could be good this that's the we're not going to talk about how this this is
[01:30:19.800 --> 01:30:24.680]   the day which we're going to stay away from the the hot button topic but yeah we don't have to hope
[01:30:24.680 --> 01:30:29.720]   we're sitting on the hot button right now the button has been pressed
[01:30:29.720 --> 01:30:37.080]   actually because england is going through a lock down all apple stores in england will be
[01:30:37.080 --> 01:30:44.840]   closed for at least four weeks from thursday on so if you want to unlike in the u.s it doesn't
[01:30:44.840 --> 01:30:48.280]   look like they're doing the upgrade upgrade program over the mail yet so a bunch of people
[01:30:48.280 --> 01:30:51.480]   who've been trying to do their annual upgrade program are saying like the stores are closed can
[01:30:51.480 --> 01:30:58.440]   you help us oh that's terrible oh no yeah stuck with an iphone 11 for a whole month like an animal like
[01:30:58.440 --> 01:31:03.320]   an animal yeah that that was one thing that i wanted to bring up when we're talking about the
[01:31:03.320 --> 01:31:09.000]   analyst call this is this is an interesting opportunity to take a look at well what if we
[01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:13.640]   what do the numbers look like when we remove almost all of the retail sales that would normally
[01:31:13.640 --> 01:31:18.280]   have had during that quarter what do the numbers look like that if apple doesn't actually release
[01:31:18.280 --> 01:31:22.840]   specific numbers on a lot of specific things it'll give us a lot of data now that we can infer
[01:31:22.840 --> 01:31:31.000]   conclusions from and so that's it's it's it's more of a logistics problem really for for people
[01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:34.680]   like i said like uh like uh rene said people who need to get their upgrades who need to get their
[01:31:34.680 --> 01:31:39.640]   swap outs uh to have them do all that stuff by mail instead of being able to take advantage of one
[01:31:39.640 --> 01:31:45.560]   the biggest advantages of having an apple which is for most people you can get in a car in 20
[01:31:45.560 --> 01:31:49.480]   minutes later be in front of someone who will swap you up for some of it needs to be swapped out
[01:31:49.480 --> 01:31:58.120]   yeah it is too bad but on the other hand that's probably a good thing
[01:31:59.480 --> 01:32:04.360]   yeah i mean you gotta do what you feel like you gotta do also it's possible that they've had
[01:32:04.360 --> 01:32:09.080]   instructions from their insurance companies saying that if you do not take if you don't take proper
[01:32:09.080 --> 01:32:14.760]   precautions that we're advising you that will not help us to process any claims of damage should
[01:32:14.760 --> 01:32:19.480]   bad things happen yeah it could be that or could be you know apple might just be erring on the side
[01:32:19.480 --> 01:32:25.160]   of protecting their customers which i would expect from apple frankly although protecting their
[01:32:25.160 --> 01:32:30.440]   property oh oh you're talking about boarding it up yeah yeah yeah oh yeah i'm sorry yeah i was still
[01:32:30.440 --> 01:32:35.560]   i was still thinking about covid oh yeah yeah um that's yeah boarding it up absolutely i'm hey if i
[01:32:35.560 --> 01:32:42.200]   you know what if we were in downtown san francisco i'd be boarding up our windows too i you why take a
[01:32:42.200 --> 01:32:55.080]   chance piece of plywood's cheap apple uh has been in a lawsuit with ver net x
[01:32:55.480 --> 01:33:02.920]   for i don't know so gross 10 years uh this isn't over i i doubt it is but they have been ordered to
[01:33:02.920 --> 01:33:11.080]   pay half a billion dollars to ver net x in this uh in this trial apple says we're gonna appeal
[01:33:11.080 --> 01:33:16.440]   these are patents unrelated to the core operations of our products have been found to be invalid by
[01:33:16.440 --> 01:33:24.120]   the patent office cases like this only served a stifle innovation and harm consumers this is the
[01:33:24.120 --> 01:33:29.320]   second one they lost the face time one the supreme court refused to hear it and now this is the vpn one
[01:33:29.320 --> 01:33:36.760]   yeah yeah and where and where was this cus suit filed do we have to guess oh yeah rocket docket yeah
[01:33:36.760 --> 01:33:42.680]   yeah uh the the it must be a little disappointing because the judgment the half billion dollar
[01:33:42.680 --> 01:33:50.520]   judgment was voided at the end of last year but reinstated by a u.s appeals court i guess in
[01:33:50.520 --> 01:33:57.080]   or no a federal court in texas yeah so it's just it's just a yeah i mean i got looking
[01:33:57.080 --> 01:34:02.440]   afforded but it's just you don't want to see this kind of thing honestly right well also this this
[01:34:02.440 --> 01:34:07.720]   demonstrates positively negatively the power of being a large tech company as opposed to being a
[01:34:07.720 --> 01:34:12.600]   small one uh where the only the only way you can the only possible way you can prevail and stuff
[01:34:12.600 --> 01:34:18.680]   like this is to just keep appealing keep appealing keep appealing until the person who was hoping for
[01:34:18.680 --> 01:34:24.920]   a a timely payout of whatever they thought that they could steal from from from the patent holder
[01:34:24.920 --> 01:34:30.120]   decides that okay look let's negotiate give us something just to end this uh and but the thing is
[01:34:30.120 --> 01:34:34.840]   apple can wait that sort of thing out a smaller company they just have to pay at some point because
[01:34:34.840 --> 01:34:41.160]   they don't have that kind of award chest uh and similarly on the that's also why regulating a company
[01:34:41.160 --> 01:34:46.280]   like other sides of google or apple or facebook is so difficult because whatever action the government
[01:34:46.280 --> 01:34:52.040]   tries to take they've got enough money that they can keep continue to appeal and appeal and appeal
[01:34:52.040 --> 01:34:57.560]   which is why almost every action that the ftc uh where the doj tries to take against a large
[01:34:57.560 --> 01:35:02.200]   company like this always ends in some sort of a negotiated settlement because that's the
[01:35:02.200 --> 01:35:07.160]   they effectively that's the only way these things ever end if they can uh if they agree to stop
[01:35:07.160 --> 01:35:14.520]   appealing it's also these the the patent companies tend to sue one large company and use that as a
[01:35:14.520 --> 01:35:20.440]   war chest to then start right suing their way up and down sometimes just accumulating money for
[01:35:20.440 --> 01:35:24.520]   the next target in the next target and especially like these some of these were just really observed
[01:35:24.520 --> 01:35:30.040]   they were like fax machine patents and things yeah yeah what what a proud line of work to be in
[01:35:30.040 --> 01:35:34.200]   what a wonderful thing to when you go to your 25th anniversary of 25th reunion at your high
[01:35:34.200 --> 01:35:38.760]   school what do you do oh well i'm fighting covid and you know if it's been tough oh what do you do well
[01:35:38.760 --> 01:35:44.280]   the thing is i'm adopting kids what do you do well i look for borderline fraudulent
[01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:48.520]   patent claims and try to intimidate companies that the suddenly give me a big payout
[01:35:48.520 --> 01:35:54.120]   do you know why your android friends can't use face time no because of me because of me oh oh
[01:35:54.120 --> 01:36:01.400]   what an accomplishment clips version 3.0 is out now with hdr video if you're if you're getting a new
[01:36:01.400 --> 01:36:07.880]   iPhone you'll be glad you can do uh Dolby vision hdr video in clips which is i you know it's funny
[01:36:07.880 --> 01:36:13.320]   that they're they're they i'm glad they're supporting it i guess they figure this is the app for
[01:36:13.320 --> 01:36:18.440]   influencers and social media to create videos and clips well it's got vertical and horizontal
[01:36:18.440 --> 01:36:23.320]   video finally so that might end up being true oh yeah i point just like the square yeah you couldn't
[01:36:23.320 --> 01:36:30.440]   do that one i don't think was taking them too far oh okay okay um what about this i think we'd
[01:36:30.440 --> 01:36:35.480]   heard at least in the rumors that the iphone 12 was going to have reverse charging apple did not
[01:36:35.480 --> 01:36:44.200]   announce it but apparently you can find it in the patent i don't see like there was all these
[01:36:44.200 --> 01:36:47.640]   stories about last year and it was just it was just never in there and i wonder if this is going
[01:36:47.640 --> 01:36:52.600]   to be because like apple doesn't usually do chipsets they do feature sets and i wonder if this will be
[01:36:52.600 --> 01:36:57.080]   you have your air tags if you put your air tags on that say it'll charge the air tags you stick
[01:36:57.080 --> 01:37:02.120]   your Samsung phone on there you get nothing right yeah yeah it would have to be have to be to
[01:37:02.120 --> 01:37:07.480]   think things like charging your air parts air pods not necessarily getting enough charge on your
[01:37:07.480 --> 01:37:12.120]   partner's iphone that they can make but make those two or three phone calls but this is this is the
[01:37:12.120 --> 01:37:17.480]   classic thing that i like it is the sort of feature where it could be waiting there just waiting for
[01:37:17.480 --> 01:37:23.240]   some o.s update to simply flip a flip a flag from zero to one and suddenly if you connect the right
[01:37:23.240 --> 01:37:28.360]   kind of device or drop the correct kind of g charger on top of it you suddenly get this feature for
[01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:36.600]   free that they didn't sell you apple is released uh... ios 14.2 beta release candidate for
[01:37:36.600 --> 01:37:44.840]   developers that means i guess that the public beta will be out soon what's new in uh 14.2 anything
[01:37:44.840 --> 01:37:52.440]   exciting let me tell you something about people detection people detection yeah so it's an
[01:37:52.440 --> 01:37:58.840]   accessibility to feature that's coming to ios 14.2 it's already available in the beta
[01:37:58.840 --> 01:38:05.880]   and this um it uses the lidar scanner combined with machine learning combined with
[01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:17.560]   the the camera itself to recognize when a person is coming toward you it works through the the zoom
[01:38:17.560 --> 01:38:23.640]   it actually uses it's in the zoom accessibility feature and it uses the camera and it recognizes
[01:38:23.640 --> 01:38:29.960]   when a person is within the view of the camera and then tells you it gets sends you feedback either
[01:38:29.960 --> 01:38:37.800]   audio or visual or through tactile feedback like how close that person is and when they get closer
[01:38:37.800 --> 01:38:45.080]   and when they get further away and it's it's just this it's a general um excel stability feature for
[01:38:45.080 --> 01:38:51.960]   sight and paired but it's also exactly what's needed right now during a social distancing time so
[01:38:51.960 --> 01:38:58.920]   you can actually set up um like a geo perimeter around you one of the of the features that it
[01:38:58.920 --> 01:39:05.640]   offers that allows you to set up a geo feature it's defaulted to six feet so at within this in
[01:39:05.640 --> 01:39:12.440]   this particular one it's it sends um a tone to you when somebody is within the camera view but they're
[01:39:12.440 --> 01:39:18.520]   outside of six feet and then a different tone if that person comes within six feet so you're
[01:39:18.520 --> 01:39:23.000]   constantly you know people who are sight impaired and this frankly this is this is usable for even
[01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:27.480]   you and I if we're in a situation where it seems like it's a little crowded we can pop that up and
[01:39:27.480 --> 01:39:31.240]   kind of use it for ourselves and kind of look around and say are we six feet away from the
[01:39:31.240 --> 01:39:37.160]   people around us do we need to move yeah it's it's people's detection it's within the zoom magnifier
[01:39:37.160 --> 01:39:46.040]   um accessibility um app uh settings in iOS 14.2 so it's it's pretty incredible it sounds like
[01:39:46.040 --> 01:39:54.920]   um it's going to be really really useful right now for people detection and it's also available
[01:39:54.920 --> 01:40:00.360]   to developers through ARKit and through core ML so developers will be able to use the same
[01:40:00.360 --> 01:40:06.040]   technology to create their own apps that do things like maybe um card detection for example so you
[01:40:06.040 --> 01:40:10.360]   could you know have somebody who's walking down the street they could use this to make sure that
[01:40:10.360 --> 01:40:14.360]   they are in a safe spot to to cross the street or something like that so it's really really
[01:40:14.360 --> 01:40:19.320]   exciting yeah can you also imagine like when this moves to the glasses eventually what kind of
[01:40:19.320 --> 01:40:24.920]   an accessibility device that will become it's so exciting you kind of expect that actually this
[01:40:24.920 --> 01:40:32.280]   is just the beginning too yeah yeah imagine you know this they're just they they said okay let's take
[01:40:32.280 --> 01:40:37.000]   machine learning and let's take the light our scanner and let's take our camera that you know
[01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:42.200]   has low light vision and let's mash it together and see what comes up so like this is just the
[01:40:42.200 --> 01:40:47.080]   start of a lot of things that could come in the future in terms of benefiting accessibility and
[01:40:47.080 --> 01:40:53.080]   just like Rene is saying how all of this could be incorporated into apple glasses that could just
[01:40:53.080 --> 01:40:59.320]   help with accessibility in the future it's very exciting very exciting so excited yeah that that's
[01:40:59.320 --> 01:41:04.040]   why so there's so many people who are writing about accessibility today that are doing such
[01:41:04.040 --> 01:41:10.040]   really great important work because it's it's one thing to appreciate the technology in the abstract
[01:41:10.040 --> 01:41:13.960]   it's quite another to understand exactly how well or how poorly it'll actually work
[01:41:13.960 --> 01:41:20.040]   in people's daily lives uh i mean they're both on android and and ios there are all kinds of
[01:41:20.040 --> 01:41:26.360]   different technologies that are uh that are again they're they're very eye opening and they seem
[01:41:26.360 --> 01:41:30.440]   like something that should have been worked on a long time ago and that's why that's why i've
[01:41:30.440 --> 01:41:34.760]   got a lot of different people that are i've added to on my twitter list and on my blog follows
[01:41:34.760 --> 01:41:40.120]   just to learn about it i can't that sounds good i can't wait to actually find out how well this
[01:41:40.120 --> 01:41:45.640]   thing works from somebody who actually uses it do you think it's does it use the uwb ultra wide
[01:41:45.640 --> 01:41:52.840]   band u1 chip is it no it's not okay it uses the light our scanner so it uses the camera
[01:41:52.840 --> 01:41:59.400]   aiming your camera around you to do that oh and and also it only works with with a phone that has a
[01:41:59.400 --> 01:42:07.080]   lighter scanner on it so it only works with the uh 12 pro 12 max or ipad pro uh i wonder if that
[01:42:07.080 --> 01:42:13.720]   will come out next tuesday maybe with an air tags release that it might be part of an overall kind
[01:42:13.720 --> 01:42:21.320]   of location kind of know what's going on you're my beyond is not in there situational awareness
[01:42:21.320 --> 01:42:27.560]   features that kind of thing yeah there's a lot of stuff like that even even just simply things
[01:42:27.560 --> 01:42:33.800]   like keeping the keep the microphone open and when it detects a baby cry or a dog bark or an alarm
[01:42:33.800 --> 01:42:39.480]   to translate that into uh for people who won't be able to actually hear it to something visual but
[01:42:39.480 --> 01:42:44.680]   also as we've as we keep seeing keep seeing time and time again a lot of these
[01:42:44.680 --> 01:42:49.400]   accessibility features are also just useful for the general general population imagine being
[01:42:49.400 --> 01:42:53.720]   able to get like a text alert or an alert on your watch when it says that oh by the way there's a
[01:42:53.720 --> 01:42:57.480]   dog that i picked up the sound of a dark dog barking elsewhere in the house because you have
[01:42:57.480 --> 01:43:02.440]   all these other cameras and all these extra all these extra devices around um but yeah but but
[01:43:02.440 --> 01:43:07.240]   but as as i was uh i was trying to see as i'm talking i'm trying to i'm looking through steven
[01:43:07.240 --> 01:43:12.440]   akino's uh feed of course to see if to see if they to see if they've said i think i think he
[01:43:12.440 --> 01:43:17.640]   he said something about that recently but i can't find it but anyway that's his forms column is so
[01:43:17.640 --> 01:43:24.680]   good yeah exactly i mean he's he's one of the there there all everyone on this panel is is a
[01:43:24.680 --> 01:43:29.400]   commentator that i'm grateful for because they add perspective and thoughts and thinking that
[01:43:29.400 --> 01:43:35.560]   but for some reason we're not available to me uh due to my own personal uh brain hardware but uh
[01:43:35.560 --> 01:43:40.440]   steven akino is another one of those people that oh that's right okay i'm less dumb thank you very
[01:43:40.440 --> 01:43:47.720]   much he is uh freelance uh but he covers accessibility and uh writes for forms and others and uh so i
[01:43:47.720 --> 01:43:53.720]   am going to start following again i can speak and also let me just say steven akino also freelances
[01:43:53.720 --> 01:43:58.360]   for i'm more so just uh look out for for his art of color i'm more too and he does have the
[01:43:58.360 --> 01:44:02.600]   he's been doing a lot more for forms though which is which is great the definitive article on people
[01:44:02.600 --> 01:44:09.160]   detection uh and folks that came out to october 30th so if you want to read more about that now i'm
[01:44:09.160 --> 01:44:16.360]   very interested very interested wow uh because people it's just a first step but once you can
[01:44:16.360 --> 01:44:19.960]   recognize people you can recognize other things around you too and it's lidar so it doesn't know
[01:44:19.960 --> 01:44:24.120]   that like there's no privacy implications it doesn't know it and your lorry right i mean just knows
[01:44:24.120 --> 01:44:30.200]   that there is a picture uses shape it's so clever like it uses the the actual rgb camera to do
[01:44:31.480 --> 01:44:36.760]   computational vision to determine that it's a human-like thing and then uses the lidar to
[01:44:36.760 --> 01:44:42.200]   track the distance but it doesn't know who the human is it just it detects that there is a human
[01:44:42.200 --> 01:44:47.240]   like shape uh which i think is a good implementation and that's the machine learning to that that from
[01:44:47.240 --> 01:44:51.960]   from the camera to determine like a human like shape just like you're saying yeah yes
[01:44:51.960 --> 01:44:56.840]   can i can i say that one of the most there oftentimes the things that impress me most about a
[01:44:56.840 --> 01:45:02.040]   technology about the potential of a technology are the simplest damn things i think it was two
[01:45:02.040 --> 01:45:07.480]   google ios ago or maybe even three uh that google introduced some accessibility
[01:45:07.480 --> 01:45:13.400]   accessibility features that were basically about demonstrating about uh again trans using machine
[01:45:13.400 --> 01:45:20.120]   learning to translate what the phone camera sees into audio or into useful text and it just occurred
[01:45:20.120 --> 01:45:26.600]   to me that for to a to make the software more useful they just built this a very very simple
[01:45:26.600 --> 01:45:31.800]   like a sling uh like pendant sling that you just a pocket that's uh that that's on a quarter on your
[01:45:31.800 --> 01:45:37.160]   neck so that you can wear the phone just like with the camera phasing out and it did occur and it
[01:45:37.160 --> 01:45:43.640]   really did occur to me that even again for all users that is such a high potential sort of concept
[01:45:43.640 --> 01:45:51.320]   that if you have that uh if this plus in your piece in your ear to have this device giving you cues
[01:45:51.320 --> 01:45:57.080]   as to things that are within the range of the camera but you may not have actually detected yet
[01:45:57.080 --> 01:46:01.560]   such as oh by the way you're getting really close to this person ahead of you or by the way this
[01:46:01.560 --> 01:46:04.840]   person that's approaching you you know them they're in your address book here's their name here's the
[01:46:04.840 --> 01:46:10.680]   last time you talk to them uh or just or just hey what's the or just tapping your button and like
[01:46:10.680 --> 01:46:15.320]   standing in front of a store and saying hey what uh what time is this or excuse me what does this
[01:46:15.320 --> 01:46:20.600]   sign in in front of me say and it translates the Korean of this oh this is not a restaurant this
[01:46:20.600 --> 01:46:25.480]   is a dry cleaners the the shirts on this window probably should have tipped you off but that but
[01:46:25.480 --> 01:46:29.400]   that's the sort of stuff we we talk about hey how about new apple silicon how about this great new
[01:46:29.400 --> 01:46:35.160]   5g network but oftentimes it's just as simple as how about what if we just simply take this thing
[01:46:35.160 --> 01:46:40.280]   that used to be just dark in our pockets and turn it into something that we're just going to be wearing
[01:46:40.280 --> 01:46:45.560]   a lip allow to have vision and to to allow us to have a little extra perception to our surroundings
[01:46:45.560 --> 01:46:49.560]   that's an interesting thing nope people would scare the hell out of people because oh boy
[01:46:49.560 --> 01:46:56.280]   live camera on all the time but we're but sometimes sometimes you you should you should write the
[01:46:56.280 --> 01:47:01.960]   white paper uh and give the demo and then let people decide uh whether the society wants this or not
[01:47:02.920 --> 01:47:11.160]   not only can you order your iPhone 12 pro max and your iPhone 12 mini on Friday but the home pod
[01:47:11.160 --> 01:47:18.600]   mini goes up for pre-order on November 6th and yes it's weird that i'm almost as as excited about
[01:47:18.600 --> 01:47:23.720]   the pod mini as i am about that i'm just trying to decide how many how many rooms i have to buy
[01:47:23.720 --> 01:47:30.360]   i know i'm getting at least two of them i might get three i feel like i'm i'm going overboard if i
[01:47:30.360 --> 01:47:36.680]   get three i don't know one of the uh features they mentioned was a third party music apps and that's
[01:47:36.680 --> 01:47:43.160]   it's begun pandaora was added to the home pod yesterday so i'm hoping that we'll get other uh
[01:47:43.160 --> 01:47:50.360]   solutions if it's an open api it's entirely up to them oh is it really weird music deals to
[01:47:50.360 --> 01:47:55.720]   oh interesting people who pay people to let them pay so all you have to do if your spotify is
[01:47:56.760 --> 01:48:02.280]   support this api and then how would you that's it and then it just adds it yeah oh and you can
[01:48:02.280 --> 01:48:06.680]   even make a default like you can you can you can set it as a default and it'll answer you for music
[01:48:06.680 --> 01:48:13.160]   what if you could do that for twit can we be the default podcast got 12 billion dollars
[01:48:13.160 --> 01:48:19.320]   a shlomo play podcast oh yeah i have a lot right here all the mac break week episodes of Andy
[01:48:20.920 --> 01:48:26.760]   yeah i've been ready uh yeah so yeah i mean it's 99 bucks but i could see ordering you know
[01:48:26.760 --> 01:48:31.560]   one for especially because of the handoff and the intercom and all of that and might
[01:48:31.560 --> 01:48:35.000]   might be nice to have one in every room i'll wait till you buy a couple and you could tell me
[01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:39.240]   how good they sound your music okay like barbecue equipment laura you could test it for us yeah
[01:48:39.240 --> 01:48:48.200]   i did buy i did buy a pellet driven pizza oven however so oh nice yeah i'll test that for you laura
[01:48:48.200 --> 01:48:53.240]   i don't know yet has it come yet but i wanted that for thanksgiving so i don't have to eat turkey
[01:48:53.240 --> 01:48:59.000]   it'll be really interesting i'll say you're not gonna smoke a turkey i am a smokot turkey in the
[01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:05.080]   trigger and i will serve a beautiful smoked turkey and i will say on this table there's turkey on this
[01:49:05.080 --> 01:49:12.840]   table we have some pizzas from our pizza oven and we'll see which table is empty first i'm just saying
[01:49:12.840 --> 01:49:18.680]   it could be a side dish pizza plus oh yeah pizza's pizza's good for everything all the time every day
[01:49:18.680 --> 01:49:25.080]   any time yeah i i believe i'll be eating pizza all night tonight actually yeah right yeah
[01:49:25.080 --> 01:49:31.400]   Alex Wilhelm was tweeted is it is it time to order pizza yet hey you got any stuff to soap up the
[01:49:31.400 --> 01:49:37.560]   burger but the bourbon that's for sure that's yeah yeah yeah yeah uh apple tv news i'm glad to hear
[01:49:37.560 --> 01:49:43.960]   this there is a show called severance adam scott patricia arquette john turturo already a great
[01:49:43.960 --> 01:49:53.000]   cast christopher walkin has uh signed up to join the ensemble it is it's crazy i was stranded
[01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:59.000]   on apple tv no that was the only thing i hope i hope this is one of the times where they hire
[01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:04.280]   christopher walkin to be the actor that he has always been amazing in in the 70s and the 80s i hope
[01:50:04.280 --> 01:50:09.640]   they don't hire him to be christopher walkin it's the first it's the first regular series role for
[01:50:09.640 --> 01:50:16.520]   the oscar winning actor the the show severance sets is set in a company called lumen industries
[01:50:16.520 --> 01:50:22.520]   that aims to take the work life balance to the next level i don't know what that means
[01:50:22.520 --> 01:50:29.960]   walkin will play yeah or sex in the halls or what i don't know what uh walkin will play burt
[01:50:31.160 --> 01:50:40.280]   the head of optics and design um i'll give you some more adam scott is mark an employee with a
[01:50:40.280 --> 01:50:46.440]   shady past who's trying to put himself back together patricia arquette plays marks boss and
[01:50:46.440 --> 01:50:53.480]   john turturo plays a long time employee of the company production will begin later this month
[01:50:54.680 --> 01:51:02.280]   um it was created by dan arrickson uh showrunner is mark freeman from amc's dispatches from elsewhere
[01:51:02.280 --> 01:51:10.760]   ben stiller it was also directing sounds interesting the first tv work for walkin since peter pan live
[01:51:10.760 --> 01:51:15.720]   oh yeah i i would have taken a few years off after that oh tinker bell
[01:51:15.720 --> 01:51:18.280]   i've got a fever
[01:51:20.600 --> 01:51:28.120]   holy cow is more about but it is his first uh first job as a regular in a series
[01:51:28.120 --> 01:51:35.080]   i'm glad i'm glad to see more apple uh tv content it is coming to the xbox november 10th just in time
[01:51:35.080 --> 01:51:42.120]   for the xbox series 10 or series x launch although if apple tv is on it do you have to call it the
[01:51:42.120 --> 01:51:49.240]   series 10 maybe they are they are building a nice portfolio this it's it's clearly not yet
[01:51:49.240 --> 01:51:53.240]   time to start really charging people for apple tv but they're clearly getting to a point where
[01:51:53.240 --> 01:51:58.680]   next year they can say they're people who decided to take the free trial are gonna encounter
[01:51:58.680 --> 01:52:03.880]   a no interesting original material that they might consider keeping it on yeah um
[01:52:03.880 --> 01:52:16.360]   okay yeah it's they extended it till february what happens to my apple do i apple one i don't
[01:52:17.560 --> 01:52:22.040]   you start you start paying for it i'm paying i paid for apple one the minute i said yes they
[01:52:22.040 --> 01:52:27.080]   charge me 30 bucks or you know you you start paying for it you don't get any kind of break
[01:52:27.080 --> 01:52:32.360]   break even though i yeah yeah so maybe it would if if you cared you might want to wait till february
[01:52:32.360 --> 01:52:36.920]   and then i've actually i've actually decided to wait i was gonna do it right away but the
[01:52:36.920 --> 01:52:44.280]   tier that i'm getting it's actually not really a discount if i'm still getting tv plus for free so
[01:52:44.280 --> 01:52:48.760]   i decided i would wait until february i'm gonna do it i'm just gonna postpone it a little bit longer
[01:52:48.760 --> 01:52:55.880]   yeah um and before we get to our picks of the week i just want to
[01:52:55.880 --> 01:53:04.360]   tell everybody sad to say that uh shan cannery as you know passed away did not write that letter
[01:53:04.360 --> 01:53:10.600]   nope you would never admit to being james bong that's that's the giveaway there's a 007
[01:53:10.600 --> 01:53:14.520]   watermark and the letter so it's starting to circulate again because it's a great story
[01:53:14.520 --> 01:53:19.640]   mr jobs i will say this one more time you do understand english don't you i do not sell my
[01:53:19.640 --> 01:53:24.440]   soul for apple or any other company i have no interest in changing the world as you suggest
[01:53:24.440 --> 01:53:30.280]   you have nothing i need or want your computer salesman i am effing james bond i didn't think
[01:53:30.280 --> 01:53:35.400]   of no quicker way to destroy my career than to appear in one of your grass adverts please do not
[01:53:35.400 --> 01:53:40.280]   conduct me again best shan cannery i should have let Andy do that his shan cannery is much better
[01:53:40.280 --> 01:53:46.840]   than mine uh you will see it floating around it is never was real so
[01:53:46.840 --> 01:53:55.960]   gosh he was he was he was he was also one of those old guys that makes young people think you know what
[01:53:55.960 --> 01:54:00.920]   it might be it might be so bad it might be worth eating right and exercising if i could be a cool
[01:54:00.920 --> 01:54:07.560]   old person man or woman like like Helen mary or like or like shan cannery or like shan cannery
[01:54:07.560 --> 01:54:14.920]   oh my goodness he um uh was 90 when he passed away so he lived a good long life we're glad to see
[01:54:14.920 --> 01:54:19.480]   that i on uh on halloween remember we were talking about scary movies i opted not to watch
[01:54:19.480 --> 01:54:26.440]   a scary movie but instead watched the hunt for red october yes i watched a dr no and gold finger
[01:54:26.440 --> 01:54:33.400]   did you really oh i gotta go back to those two i was so disappointed i have uh the my streaming
[01:54:33.400 --> 01:54:37.400]   box you know of course it does it does like recommendations and you can always tell like what's
[01:54:37.400 --> 01:54:42.840]   in the news by like what's being recommended like like when uh when the when the person who was in
[01:54:42.840 --> 01:54:47.800]   the kid who was on home improvement got arrested uh like oh gee why is home improvement suddenly
[01:54:47.800 --> 01:54:52.200]   like at the top of the recommendation was but it's okay so so dr no was number two on the
[01:54:52.200 --> 01:54:59.560]   recommendation was number number one was zardaw so i'm like oh wow a little respect people come on
[01:54:59.560 --> 01:55:05.320]   there's so so much better so actually there's three things we will debunk no shan cannot
[01:55:05.320 --> 01:55:11.720]   he does not look good in a man kini uh he did not open a golf course for donald trump in scotland
[01:55:11.720 --> 01:55:18.200]   nor did he help and that letter steve jobs is a fake so there we go poor guy poor guy had to

[01:58:15.320 --> 01:58:23.400]   just has it taken over from pokimongo uh no in terms of our traffic um pokimongo still does better
[01:58:23.400 --> 01:58:28.920]   but in terms of how much we write about it yes you were right that's the page holy cow and do you
[01:58:28.920 --> 01:58:37.400]   write about it or is it uh there uh we actually have um rebecca spear is our um our nintendo gaming
[01:58:37.400 --> 01:58:45.240]   guru um so she does yeah it's pretty amazing right uh when you are start when you want to get into
[01:58:45.240 --> 01:58:52.920]   the new i got this one i got this one by the way that one is so cute it is so cute in fact it's an
[01:58:52.920 --> 01:58:57.720]   animal crossing edition of the nintendo switch which does not come with animal crossing but
[01:58:58.440 --> 01:59:04.120]   the thing that's fine because i just i just put it next to my tv and and it makes me happy
[01:59:04.120 --> 01:59:10.200]   i wanted that one but i could not bring myself to spend three hundred dollars on a second game i
[01:59:10.200 --> 01:59:15.320]   just i couldn't do it i wanted it so bad but it was just for what it looks like i'm just i'm glad
[01:59:15.320 --> 01:59:21.800]   that i hadn't bought us well i did buy a switch but i'm glad i lost it to my son and i had excuse
[01:59:21.800 --> 01:59:30.280]   to buy another one yeah yeah uh and i am i'm working on the perfect pumpkins uh thank you for that
[01:59:30.280 --> 01:59:35.960]   article as well Rebecca awesome fantastic how to get perfect pumpkins and animal crossing and he's
[01:59:35.960 --> 01:59:43.000]   opening up a lot of shopping i have a steaming mug of coffee actually in my kitchen and animal
[01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:50.440]   cursing the perpetual steam i can't drink it but it's steaming the torch castanza i'd like to change
[01:59:50.440 --> 01:59:54.840]   my previous answer it's possible that what i was saying is that i would love to go outside and do
[01:59:54.840 --> 02:00:01.480]   heroin with a heroin people uh i'm gonna buy some heroin no no no no maybe i should be a designated
[02:00:01.480 --> 02:00:05.800]   driver for it made it this long not being a member of guns and roses let's not change that now
[02:00:05.800 --> 02:00:13.240]   larry you're picking up the week and nothing to do with animal crossing in fact in honor of this
[02:00:13.240 --> 02:00:18.920]   conversation that we've been having now that i know that you are on board with animal crossing i
[02:00:18.920 --> 02:00:24.360]   really do think you're going to appreciate this so it is called animal crossing new horizons
[02:00:24.360 --> 02:00:33.480]   travel guide it's it's shortened to a ac and h travel guide by jeffrey kuken so look for it because
[02:00:33.480 --> 02:00:41.960]   it's absolutely hands down the best way for you to keep track of and be aware of um all of the
[02:00:41.960 --> 02:00:45.960]   things that are happening in animal crossing i guess the only thing that it doesn't really
[02:00:46.760 --> 02:00:54.200]   do for for you but we'll probably will someday is let you know um when to expect uh meteor showers
[02:00:54.200 --> 02:01:00.040]   that's that yes i heard about that and i'm waiting i'm very excited it by for my first meteor shower
[02:01:00.040 --> 02:01:06.360]   it's going to be great you're going to have a lot of fun but yeah so this it has the daily tasks
[02:01:06.360 --> 02:01:11.320]   too so you can keep track and make sure that you've done your daily tasks um you get different
[02:01:11.320 --> 02:01:17.560]   visitors every day to your island so one day you might have um gulliver who wants you to help him
[02:01:17.560 --> 02:01:24.360]   find all of the the parts to his communicators so he can get back to his boat or you might have
[02:01:24.360 --> 02:01:29.640]   leaf show up and he sells you some um holly bushes i think you just said you had some holly bushes
[02:01:29.640 --> 02:01:34.120]   i do i have some yeah every day of the week a different person visits your island so you can
[02:01:34.120 --> 02:01:43.480]   keep track of who visited and um it tells you what bugs and and um uh fish and and creatures from
[02:01:43.480 --> 02:01:49.320]   from the sea are available right now how does he know this by the time of day nintendo doesn't
[02:01:49.320 --> 02:01:53.320]   release this information right i mean this is something you have some of it is based on um
[02:01:53.320 --> 02:02:00.280]   gleaming from previous animal crossing games and some of it is just updated live as as things come
[02:02:00.280 --> 02:02:04.840]   out right now because there's a lot of this information that is it's very similar to previous animal
[02:02:04.840 --> 02:02:12.040]   crossing games so these very smart people have put together these um database if they were so
[02:02:12.040 --> 02:02:17.720]   smart they might not be spending so much time on this i just city trading futures
[02:02:17.720 --> 02:02:26.760]   so i see my daily tasks i need to find four fossils check hit six rocks where do you find rocks i
[02:02:26.760 --> 02:02:33.880]   need more rocks i only have a iron nuggets shortage well you it just just hit the rocks that you have
[02:02:33.880 --> 02:02:39.320]   i think every island has six rocks on it you just have to oh you don't have a ladder yet i bet right
[02:02:39.320 --> 02:02:43.800]   i did i get that i got the ladder i'm very excited okay so climb up the ladder because you
[02:02:43.800 --> 02:02:48.200]   know i explore every day i go everywhere looking for rocks because i need more iron nuggets
[02:02:48.200 --> 02:02:54.200]   check turnips okay did that uh money tree i've planted three now shake your money tree do you
[02:02:54.200 --> 02:02:59.880]   know that if you plant um ten thousand bells into your money tree hole you will get ten thousand
[02:02:59.880 --> 02:03:05.160]   um i heard that per so you'll get thirty thousand bells so don't forget to do that no
[02:03:05.160 --> 02:03:09.880]   but how do you find a ten thousand bell drop you got to shake a lot of trees oh no you just
[02:03:09.880 --> 02:03:16.200]   just save up oh just put it in there bells in your pockets oh and and i better be planting some
[02:03:16.200 --> 02:03:20.360]   more money trees you can bundle up ten thousand bells and you can drop that ten thousand bells
[02:03:20.360 --> 02:03:24.760]   and then it's thirty thousand three days later so here's the good news it was three ninety-nine i
[02:03:24.760 --> 02:03:30.120]   already bought it so we're good nice thank you for not recommending a four hundred dollar grill or
[02:03:30.120 --> 02:03:37.800]   something it's expensive it's gonna be an expensive week next week i know and a naco pick of the week
[02:03:37.800 --> 02:03:45.400]   uh you know what a big fan i am of the raspberry pie oh isn't this exciting yes so the the uh as
[02:03:45.400 --> 02:03:50.680]   for those of you who are not initiated it is this credit card side bare bones uh computer
[02:03:50.680 --> 02:03:55.320]   that you can do whatever you want with it has usb ports it has ethernet it has wi-fi it has
[02:03:55.320 --> 02:04:02.120]   bluetooth it can run a uh a desktop version of linux it has an open like a pin header so that if you
[02:04:02.120 --> 02:04:06.760]   want to build your own hardware for it or buy other expansion hardware for it you can do it you can
[02:04:06.760 --> 02:04:12.760]   run it as a media server as a device that uh removes all the ads from uh from your home network
[02:04:12.760 --> 02:04:16.440]   blah blah whatever you want to do with it every what i love about it is that it's kind of a return
[02:04:16.440 --> 02:04:22.840]   to the idea of a computer that you control inside and out absolutely top to bottom in a world in which
[02:04:22.840 --> 02:04:27.240]   you have a phone you know that it works kind of and you just don't know where to put the oil in the
[02:04:27.240 --> 02:04:31.240]   gas and then that's part of probably about it uh the only problem with the raspberry pie has always
[02:04:31.240 --> 02:04:37.160]   been that if you wanted to use it as a computer you had to then okay so i got to buy a case for it
[02:04:37.160 --> 02:04:41.880]   and i got to buy a power adapter and i got buy a keyboard and i got to like prepare a micro SD card
[02:04:41.880 --> 02:04:45.480]   with the that'll boot off it for the operating system so they just came up with this brand new
[02:04:45.480 --> 02:04:52.840]   thing that they're calling the raspberry pie 400 which is kind of like the the the the the the end point
[02:04:52.840 --> 02:04:58.600]   the 2020 version of like the Commodore 64 or the apple 2 it is a complete raspberry product computer
[02:04:58.600 --> 02:05:06.600]   inside a keyboard uh and so it has all the HDMI out it has a usb it has uh all the connectors on the
[02:05:06.600 --> 02:05:12.360]   back of it it also ships with the operating system on a bootable uh on a bootable flash card uh if
[02:05:12.360 --> 02:05:16.680]   you buy the hundred dollar package it will even include a mouse for you all the cables you need
[02:05:16.680 --> 02:05:22.920]   the power adapter uh and for hundred bucks you get a really fun to use computer that you can just
[02:05:22.920 --> 02:05:28.280]   plug into whatever uh whatever tv set that you haven't been using for three or four years because
[02:05:28.280 --> 02:05:33.880]   ooh it's the ooh it's only 24 inches ooh it's 1080 instead of 4k i'm putting into the closet with
[02:05:33.880 --> 02:05:39.000]   you bastard uh no you can put pull it out and now you have a very very usable and fun to play with
[02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:45.240]   computer uh that's uh that's uh anywhere in the house you need it to be uh and if this is uh
[02:05:45.240 --> 02:05:51.400]   relevant to anybody who likes max because you're curious and intellectual people yeah you'll you'll
[02:05:51.400 --> 02:05:55.640]   enjoy playing with it uh but the other cool thing about it is that of course uh because there are
[02:05:55.640 --> 02:06:00.360]   no restrictions on what people can do with it uh you can get any kind of emulator you want forward
[02:06:00.360 --> 02:06:06.200]   so you can get game emulators for pretty much any game system of uh up to like the past like 10
[02:06:06.200 --> 02:06:11.560]   years or so you can also get there are also two different emulators for classic max so you can get
[02:06:11.560 --> 02:06:16.760]   uh there's one emulator that emulates uh like an apple uh excuse me a mac plus there's another one
[02:06:16.760 --> 02:06:23.480]   that emulates like more of a like uh more like a mac lc so like a color machine that runs uh mac
[02:06:23.480 --> 02:06:28.840]   o s 9 and of course if you can you can run apple apple uh apple 2 software on it again by installing
[02:06:28.840 --> 02:06:34.200]   the right emulator the point is that for a hundred bucks it's just you'll be you might buy it just
[02:06:34.200 --> 02:06:38.200]   because uh okay guess what i got i got a hundred bucks and i got bored i'll play with it for a little
[02:06:38.200 --> 02:06:42.200]   while and then you'll be surprised at all the things you figure out that you can do with it and all
[02:06:42.200 --> 02:06:46.920]   then eventually you'll find out gee i didn't real i didn't i've never programmed in my life i've
[02:06:46.920 --> 02:06:53.080]   never done electronic design in my life but five five months from now you've designed a Wi-Fi gadget
[02:06:53.080 --> 02:06:57.480]   so it can monitor the temperature of a pipe in the basement that tends to freeze over and
[02:06:57.480 --> 02:07:03.000]   run written a python python app with a full user user interface that that operates through your
[02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:07.720]   raspberry pi to tell you the things are working okay super super fun i've got like six seven
[02:07:07.720 --> 02:07:12.680]   different raspberry pies i just ordered this one it ships in it starts shipping in a couple of days
[02:07:12.680 --> 02:07:17.960]   but for a hundred bucks that's a big old box of money ising i think it's more than that i think
[02:07:17.960 --> 02:07:25.560]   this is a desktop computer and under a hundred bucks uh it's amazing it's really amazing it can
[02:07:25.560 --> 02:07:32.280]   run a chromium based up chromium based web web browser it can also uh run firefox so you get a full
[02:07:32.280 --> 02:07:38.680]   play youtube videos it has it knows that you probably want to watch uh watch a streaming video
[02:07:38.680 --> 02:07:44.840]   so you can it is powerful enough to stream video and hd you'll be very very surprised that the more
[02:07:44.840 --> 02:07:49.560]   you try to throw something at it and find something that doesn't really work well the more you how to
[02:07:49.560 --> 02:07:54.200]   work to find that sort of thing because for basic for basic needs even if you're just buying it as a
[02:07:54.200 --> 02:07:59.320]   hey the kids need a computer so that they can again do their stuff through google docs or whatever
[02:07:59.320 --> 02:08:03.960]   it's there's very little they will they will complain because they were actually trying to
[02:08:03.960 --> 02:08:08.440]   trick you into buying a two thousand dollar gaming pc but the fact the matter is this hundred dollar
[02:08:08.440 --> 02:08:14.360]   keyboard based thing uh will work just fine oh yeah runs raspbian but as you said a bunch of other
[02:08:14.360 --> 02:08:20.200]   things whatever whatever you want yeah it's just uh just really amazing i'm like this blows me away
[02:08:20.200 --> 02:08:25.480]   i think this is so yeah i think i i will continue to say that when we talk about the most important
[02:08:25.480 --> 02:08:31.800]   and the most and the greatest computers ever made raspberry pie is absolutely on the short list it is
[02:08:31.800 --> 02:08:37.080]   more there are very few things that apple or micro apple or microsoft or any other maker is
[02:08:37.080 --> 02:08:44.520]   making that is as important i think and as influential as what the raspberry pie is because i i could
[02:08:44.520 --> 02:08:48.760]   go on for the ten minutes while stop but the what i love about it is that even though they continue
[02:08:48.760 --> 02:08:54.280]   to make these quote expensive hundred dollar devices their focus is still on their original
[02:08:54.280 --> 02:08:59.240]   premise from more than for about ten years ago which is what if we were to make a computer for
[02:08:59.240 --> 02:09:04.120]   thirty dollars that's the only design thing it has to be no more than thirty dollars how powerful
[02:09:04.120 --> 02:09:09.320]   and useful a thing could we make without busting that by even one dollar and they keep pretty much
[02:09:09.320 --> 02:09:13.400]   doing the exact same thing even though they have more expensive ones they still have their their
[02:09:13.400 --> 02:09:19.160]   newest unit as always how much can we do for thirty five dollars and it turns out that in 2020 it's
[02:09:19.160 --> 02:09:23.640]   like actually no we can't have on board bluetooth and Wi-Fi yes we can have gigabit ethernet yes
[02:09:23.640 --> 02:09:30.280]   we can have a on our multi-core processor that can that can run a modern browser it's just blows
[02:09:30.280 --> 02:09:34.840]   my mind i just love it to death i'm sitting looking at one right now that's running um
[02:09:34.840 --> 02:09:41.960]   john's uh streaming digital music right john what is it's uh what are you doing with your
[02:09:41.960 --> 02:09:49.160]   raspberry pie over there it's running a digital transport from a company in india called alo
[02:09:49.160 --> 02:09:58.360]   so it's got this hat that um is uh how it gets music off my nast into my deck nice nice and uh
[02:09:58.360 --> 02:10:03.960]   all of that into a pair of eighteen thousand dollar speakers it's just incredible yep
[02:10:03.960 --> 02:10:10.840]   it just doesn't show when you when you give the the people who buy and develop for your hardware
[02:10:10.840 --> 02:10:15.720]   no limitations whatsoever this is what they're there people have figured out how to put windows
[02:10:15.720 --> 02:10:20.360]   10 on it for god's sake yeah doesn't run very well but just hey well why don't we try to figure
[02:10:20.360 --> 02:10:24.680]   out if we can do it and that's and it blows my mind that again this forty thirty forty dollar
[02:10:24.680 --> 02:10:28.840]   computer is someone decide no it would be really great if we could write the software for this and
[02:10:28.840 --> 02:10:32.920]   then develop a simple plug-in module for it that would give it high definition audio and be able
[02:10:32.920 --> 02:10:38.200]   to drive twenty thousand dollar speakers no problem let's do it yeah yep very cool i have a raspberry
[02:10:38.200 --> 02:10:47.480]   pie in my studio running my uh it's called a pie dp 11 as i love it yep uh your pick of the week
[02:10:47.480 --> 02:10:54.680]   mr rene arichy so i i changed mine i was going to mention the new moment uh lens system which is
[02:10:54.680 --> 02:11:00.040]   really good but i will save that uh for next time because you brought up well i brought up um
[02:11:00.040 --> 02:11:05.960]   thomas frank and his notion system and i realized he just started a whole new channel dedicated
[02:11:05.960 --> 02:11:11.160]   to teaching people how to use notion but in only the way that thomas frank can which is
[02:11:11.160 --> 02:11:18.040]   sort of like if you take the captain america serum and then start being a huge fan of notion i
[02:11:18.040 --> 02:11:24.520]   i love notion i've been using it for uh in about a year now and it's just incredible notion notion
[02:11:24.520 --> 02:11:31.160]   is the animal process he could it is it's animal crossing for productivity exactly sorry yeah and
[02:11:31.160 --> 02:11:36.600]   he so he has has how he built an entire an hour long video on how he built his entire task
[02:11:36.600 --> 02:11:42.360]   management app using notion or task management system using notion and just a whole it's not
[02:11:42.360 --> 02:11:45.320]   going to be a complete notion channel i'm sure there's going to be a bunch of other productivity
[02:11:45.320 --> 02:11:50.120]   stuff on there but the first few videos are all about just like masterclass level work on
[02:11:50.120 --> 02:11:55.000]   and i appreciate it because notion it right now is too much for my poor little adult brain
[02:11:55.000 --> 02:12:00.360]   i i barely use like a default notes app and get confused but it always appeals to me because of
[02:12:00.360 --> 02:12:05.720]   all the power it has which feels like you know it's sort of you took air table and slack and
[02:12:05.720 --> 02:12:10.520]   everything and just built it all into one magnificent thing that you do anything with and he really
[02:12:10.520 --> 02:12:14.600]   breaks it down and explains how all the components work and how they work together and what you can
[02:12:14.600 --> 02:12:19.800]   do with it and he only ever gives me links and notions so i had to learn some basics yeah it's
[02:12:19.800 --> 02:12:23.560]   one of the advantages enough people you know when people ask me the same thing over and over i
[02:12:23.560 --> 02:12:29.000]   just create a notion page and i i give them make it public and i give them a link it's pretty cool
[02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:32.600]   it's pretty cool yeah uh good and who is thomas frank
[02:12:32.600 --> 02:12:38.760]   sounds so thomas frank uh yeah so he's a well-known youtuber i met him because he's also on nebula
[02:12:38.760 --> 02:12:44.360]   i became familiar with his work there but he's got a huge youtube channel all productivity based
[02:12:44.360 --> 02:12:49.560]   you know sort of like and he's he's a little bit overboard like he originally set an alarm that
[02:12:49.560 --> 02:12:53.880]   wasn't a normal alarm it was an alarm where if he didn't turn it off immediately it would tweet
[02:12:53.880 --> 02:13:00.200]   that he was over sleeping and he put his phone in the other room so as soon as he heard it he had
[02:13:00.200 --> 02:13:05.320]   to get up and sprint to that phone to make sure he couldn't you know stay in bed any longer so it's
[02:13:05.320 --> 02:13:11.000]   it's just yeah he's just really really good uh his main channel is thomas frank and this new one is
[02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:15.400]   called thomas frank explains and he's like i don't want to say is a latte merlan man because
[02:13:15.400 --> 02:13:19.400]   they're very different beasts they've very different and he's different than that devalia too but
[02:13:20.200 --> 02:13:24.760]   really really he did college info geeks for a very long time and now he's sort of doing he does
[02:13:24.760 --> 02:13:30.360]   that still i think but now he's mostly doing youtube videos this is really where you see what a uh
[02:13:30.360 --> 02:13:36.760]   transformative tool youtube is somebody like him immediately could build a platform or you can
[02:13:36.760 --> 02:13:42.280]   immediately say look i'm gonna do this and there's nothing else there's no it's not a lot of uh
[02:13:42.280 --> 02:13:48.600]   uh messing around there's no gatekeepers you just do it yeah i think he's got a million
[02:13:48.600 --> 02:13:54.200]   subscribers on his main account now wow it's just really good stuff yeah uh this one's thomas frank

[02:15:38.600 --> 02:15:43.640]   we've done five episodes i think so far and she's just so smart like last week i asked her to
[02:15:43.640 --> 02:15:49.320]   explain apple's functional organization psychologically and this week i asked her why do humans both
[02:15:49.320 --> 02:15:54.600]   want freedom to choose exactly the channels we want and bundles to save money and whichever one we
[02:15:54.600 --> 02:15:58.360]   have we brought we would much rather have the other and she explained like all the psychological
[02:15:58.360 --> 02:16:03.960]   phenomena about different reward levels and different fomo levels and that's kind of cool that's
[02:16:03.960 --> 02:16:09.240]   a good that's a really good angle like uh you know the human mind and how uh you know dark
