[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:20.880]   It's time for MacBreak Weekly to show the covers
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.600]   the latest news from Cupertino joining me right now
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.880]   in studio, the man who held down the fort yesterday
[00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.840]   last week, and I appreciate it last show.
[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:28.680]   Mr. Alex Lindsay.
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.240]   It was a shaky fort, but I did the best to go.
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.440]   You held it down, my friend.
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.080]   You kept the Indians from--
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.040]   she's now going to be in trouble with the Indians.
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.080]   You kept the Muslims from invading.
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.480]   It's OK now, right?
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.320]   To be-- no?
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.800]   No.
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:40.760]   After that mosque thing?
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:41.480]   No?
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.160]   I should have probably not brought that up.
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.520]   Thank you, Alex Lindsay.
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.040]   And now--
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.240]   Wishing he desperately, wishing he were not here,
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.680]   Mr. Andy Nocko.
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:52.520]   From Baston.
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.840]   So which one of us you think is going to be hosting the show
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.480]   and all the other Twitch shows next week?
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.360]   And let's turn out--
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.280]   They can't fire me.
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.040]   I can do half.
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.040]   Like I'm sure you'll--
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.840]   Nandies with the Chicago Sun Times
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.880]   and these websites, the Celestial Waste of Bandwidth.
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.320]   There has been a move of what to get me out of the chair
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.960]   of the hosting ball as--
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.120]   Did you sit on the ball last week?
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.400]   I did.
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.200]   I bounced on the ball.
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.700]   Yeah.
[00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:15.440]   It's very comfortable.
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.200]   It's a very comfortable--
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.160]   Now I like the ball so much I got shoes that are not flat.
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.840]   The round shoes.
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:21.360]   You got those--
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.360]   The MBTs.
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.840]   No, those MBT shoes.
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:24.840]   It looks like--
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.840]   It looks like Frank's Stein's shoes.
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:28.340]   Yeah.
[00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.080]   And they're more exercises.
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.720]   The idea is you're never standing still.
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.440]   You're always wobbling.
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.280]   And that's a good thing?
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.600]   I don't see why that's a good thing,
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.400]   but I was told it was.
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.120]   So you bought a pair of Lindsay's, did you?
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.080]   Yeah.
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.480]   So now I sit on a ball at work and I wobble home.
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.880]   I'm like, oh, shit.
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.160]   There's something really desperately wrong with me.
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.160]   I think it's my wife.
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.240]   I think she's trying to make fun of me deep down.
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.840]   Look at him wobble.
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.560]   He's got everything else together, but just look at him wobble.
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.640]   I'll always keep him off.
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.160]   But it's because I want to do dancing with the stars.
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.680]   Yeah.
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.040]   That would be great for the show.
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.280]   Yeah, but great for the show, bad for me.
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.280]   So you guys last week, you're going
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.800]   to have to tell me what you talked about what you didn't
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:10.300]   talk about.
[00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.360]   I haven't had a chance to listen to the show yet.
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.120]   But you did talk about Apple's Liquid Metal patent, right?
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.240]   We talked about the patent.
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.640]   So Leander Kehaney writing in the Cult of Mac--
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.760]   a blog, CultofMac.com reveals that, in fact, liquid metal
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.880]   has already been used--
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.640]   this is very science fiction--
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.000]   in an Apple product.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.440]   Can you guess which Apple product has liquid metal in it?
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.040]   I'll give you a hint.
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.760]   Here's the picture.
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:34.520]   It is that thing.
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.240]   They don't include it anymore with the--
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.160]   The bubble wand.
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.880]   Yeah, it looks like a little tiny, tiny, elven bubble wand.
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.080]   But it would be-- it would make great bubbles, wouldn't it?
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.600]   It's the weird little pin that was included with the iPhone
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.360]   3G for popping the SIM out.
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.080]   They no longer include that since, I guess,
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.080]   the paperclip, a safety pin, anything will work.
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.960]   It seems like a lot of work just for something
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.160]   that you can use a paperclip for.
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.760]   Yeah.
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.120]   And it's liquid metal.
[00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.520]   It's hard as nails, has a distinctive color and feel.
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.800]   Those are not collector's items if you have one.
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.640]   Yeah, who saved theirs, right?
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:13.240]   So the guy who, I guess, co-invented the alloy, Atacan Pekker--
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.680]   not his real name--
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.520]   said he said, that's my metal.
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:17.680]   I recognize it immediately.
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.480]   Take it from an expert, that is liquid metal.
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.560]   CultivMac.com has independently confirmed that Apple did
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:25.880]   use liquid metal.
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.440]   They sourced the part from liquid metal technologies.
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.360]   You thought it was a SIM removal tool?
[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.880]   No, in fact, it was a test of the company's manufacturing
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:34.480]   capabilities.
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.920]   That's why they only included it once in one form of the iPhone.
[00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.800]   Never included it in the 3GS or the 4, even though they still
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.800]   have-- In fact, the 4, you needed it because you
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.280]   had to put a new SIM in, right?
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.640]   Oh, no, you didn't need it with the 4.
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.360]   You did it with the 3GS.
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.680]   Yes.
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.480]   Apparently, Apple has a strict policy that normally requires
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.920]   two separate sources for parts.
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:59.480]   This is single sourced, so they really wanted to test it.
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.920]   There are not any other sources of liquid metal.
[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.600]   Isn't that what they made the Terminator out of?
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:06.320]   It's practically--
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.960]   He went 1,000.
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:07.440]   If you have one--
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.400]   He went 1,000, exactly.
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.960]   Yeah, the two went 1,000, the original one.
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.720]   If you have one, try and bend it.
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.640]   Pekker says--
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.040]   It's practically-- I'm sorry, I'm such a child.
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.400]   It's practically unbendable by hand.
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:20.440]   That doesn't sound good at all.
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:25.440]   Call a doctor after 4, anyway.
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:31.120]   He co-invented liquid metal with engineering professor Bill
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.960]   Johnson.
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.840]   It's Pekker and Johnson.
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.560]   This isn't--
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.640]   That's not April Fool's, is it?
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:39.160]   Listeners, it helps to think that we
[00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.960]   have a combined age of something like 110, 120, and yet yes.
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.640]   We are spending the first 10 minutes.
[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.200]   Well, you see, actually, I met with somebody
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.640]   at the Wang Theater in Boston today.
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.360]   I'm sorry, the Metropolitan Opera House
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.040]   has used to be called before it got its corporate sponsorship
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.800]   in the '80s.
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.560]   So Pekker and Johnson say it's practically unbendable by hand.
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.560]   So if you've got one, I want you to try and bend it.
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.040]   And let the report back to us.
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:05.540]   Try.
[00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:06.120]   Yeah.
[00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.240]   You can't do it.
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.640]   It's like folding a piece of paper more than seven times.
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.160]   By the way, somebody told me that that was a canard.
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.400]   No, you can't do that.
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:14.560]   I haven't been able to do it.
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:15.040]   I've tried.
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.640]   I thought you couldn't-- and apparently, the Mythbusters
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:19.400]   managed somehow to bend it to fold it.
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.200]   Yeah, you can't-- with the vice.
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:23.480]   Yeah, that's--
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.040]   They did it by-- you're talking about the paper myth?
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.600]   They used the giant paper folding myth.
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:29.200]   Right, it was.
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:30.960]   They made a piece of paper that was
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.560]   about the size of a football field.
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:33.080]   Yeah.
[00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.680]   By folding it over and running it over with the steam
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:36.960]   roller with every fold.
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:37.800]   Yeah.
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:38.960]   So yes, it's possible.
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.880]   That's why skeptics are the people who
[00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:43.360]   should be running the country, because they're
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.720]   the one who will tell you that, yes, aha, idiot.
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.840]   Incidentally, all you need is a surrogate.
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:55.200]   If you are attempting to bend your Johnson in Europe or Asia,
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.080]   you didn't get the liquid metal ones.
[00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:02.280]   Only US iPhones, iPhone 3G--
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:04.040]   The universe, the special American technology--
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.480]   Yes, the ship with the liquid metal.
[00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:06.440]   So--
[00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:07.680]   Wow.
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:08.680]   Super high tech.
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:09.680]   It's pretty cool.
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:09.720]   It's pretty cool.
[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.280]   Non-exportable.
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:12.120]   So it's pretty cool.
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:14.160]   So anybody who's got one, I encourage our chat room
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.880]   to run to your part covered.
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.760]   I bet you, out of how many millions of 3Gs did they sell,
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:21.720]   I bet you nobody saved.
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:22.440]   I didn't.
[00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:22.960]   I don't know.
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:24.600]   I think there was literally one of those things
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:25.680]   where I said, what is this?
[00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.160]   Yeah.
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.840]   If I have time during commercial break,
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.120]   I can go and get you the key ring that has--
[00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:37.200]   my key ring that has the actual disk 2 installation
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:39.840]   hex wrench that came with every single disk 2 drive.
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:40.960]   It is still on my key ring.
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.560]   It has been on there since I was 15 or 16 years old.
[00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.040]   You never know when you're going to need--
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:47.280]   There's people who just hold on to such things
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:48.960]   because they're kind of cool and kind of interesting.
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.920]   And at some point, you'll win a nerd argument
[00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:52.840]   by being able to produce it unexpectedly.
[00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:54.960]   Apparently, some people are saying the iPhone still comes with it.
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:56.400]   But I don't mind it now.
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:00.880]   I only got-- I thought with the 3G, not the 3GS or the iPhone 4.
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:01.920]   I don't remember getting in at all,
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.520]   but I open things so quickly and go through them.
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:04.160]   And--
[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.160]   Exactly.
[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.520]   --Christmas morning.
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:07.480]   But it's interesting.
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:09.120]   But I'm reading more about this technology.
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:12.520]   And the more you read about it, the less interesting it gets.
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:14.480]   I think you really do need to have multiple Emmys
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:18.000]   in order to just really get excited about it.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.320]   It's a cool material.
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:22.160]   It allows you to build strong things that are light and durable.
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.720]   But there are so many different things that fall into that category.
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:26.720]   If you do a search for this basic technology,
[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:31.520]   you'll turn up, among other things, an incredibly long and $8 million
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:34.080]   looking commercial for-- I think it's an omega watch
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:36.720]   about this technology about this, using this new fusion
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:38.520]   metal with the properties of liquid.
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:42.320]   And you're like, my god, they must be building a new kind of like tank turret
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:43.000]   from it.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.440]   And then it's like-- what they're building is a watch.
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:48.560]   And like, OK, so wow, so they must be building the chassis for the watch.
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:51.520]   And then at the end, it's revealed that what all this mechanism has been doing
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:54.120]   is just-- you know the numbers on that rotating ring?
[00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:55.440]   It's just the numbers.
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.360]   The way those numbers have been inlaid into that ring,
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:59.120]   they are made out of the liquid metal.
[00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:01.120]   And OK, that's great.
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:03.360]   So much for that.
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:05.520]   Patton, all spent.
[00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:09.920]   All right, I got another story that'll be of great interest to all Apple users.
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:13.120]   Internet Explorer turned 15 yesterday.
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.120]   Mm-hmm.
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:16.320]   Interesting one that's one that's full of features.
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.920]   Oh, OK.
[00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:20.120]   It's teasing you.
[00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:23.920]   And we'd like to say that I'm kind of moving more and more away from Safari.
[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:24.720]   Chrome, baby.
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:25.520]   Don't you love Chrome?
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:26.520]   I'm really enjoying Chrome.
[00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:28.720]   And here's my comments to Safari are both web kits.
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:30.320]   So probably there isn't that much difference.
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.320]   I'll tell you what the difference is.
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:35.120]   You download-- you open up a movie on Safari nowadays.
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.320]   And you can't download it.
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:38.120]   You can't save a source.
[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:40.320]   You know, they've kind of turned all that stuff off.
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:42.720]   And so-- but you go up to Chrome and the little button's still there
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:43.720]   and you can download the stuff.
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:44.920]   And so I started using it for that.
[00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:48.520]   That's the reason I opened up Chrome, specifically just to see if I could download a movie
[00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:50.320]   that was made to be downloaded.
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:53.320]   I mean, it wasn't like I was trying to steal something off the site.
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:57.520]   And Safari, you know, to protect us from our protect content creators or whatever.
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:00.720]   Now you can't do basic operations in Safari.
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.920]   And so I just-- once I started using Chrome, I was like,
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:04.920]   I don't really want to use Safari anymore.
[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:06.120]   Is there-- I mean, really.
[00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:07.120]   It probably doesn't matter.
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:08.720]   I mean, Safari now has extensions.
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:11.720]   So probably not as rich a set of extensions.
[00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:13.120]   I don't use that many extensions.
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:16.120]   There's one called Chrome to Phone that most Apple people won't care about.
[00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:20.120]   But if you use an Android phone, you can use-- and Chrome on Mac or Windows,
[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:20.920]   you can send it.
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:25.120]   Like, I just-- like, I needed a map of somewhere I was going to go on Friday.
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:27.120]   So I used Chrome to phone to send the map to the phone.
[00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:28.320]   That's pretty cool.
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:28.520]   Yeah.
[00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:32.720]   And the cool thing is that there's actually just a little phone icon in the upper right corner of the screen.
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:35.520]   And so it's context aware so that if you just simply have an impulse
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:38.520]   that whatever I'm looking at right now, it would be useful if I had that on the phone.
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:42.520]   And not only that, but it's not just like sending like a text link.
[00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:46.520]   What happens is that downstairs-- if the phone was like in your car cradle,
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:50.320]   when you get down to the car, you will find that the maps of the maps--
[00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:51.520]   the maps app has been launched.
[00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:55.120]   It is actually set to the point that you had created.
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:57.520]   And conceivably, it's also set to navigate to that.
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:58.520]   Is that happening?
[00:10:58.520 --> 00:10:59.320]   Yeah, that's happening.
[00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:06.320]   That's a sort of monopolies that work well for the users when you have a company that makes the--
[00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:12.320]   not only makes the browser, makes the phone OS, and also makes the search infrastructure,
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:15.120]   you would hope that they would abuse their power in that kind of way,
[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:17.320]   as opposed to crushing dissidents.
[00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.320]   That's the way to abuse your power, Google.
[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:22.120]   I'm OK with a dictatorship, Florence.
[00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:23.920]   It's been a benevolent dictatorship.
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:24.720]   Apple could do it.
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:27.320]   I mean, there's no reason Apple couldn't do that.
[00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:27.920]   Right?
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:30.920]   Or somebody could even write an extension on Safari.
[00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:32.320]   The guy wrote it on an airplane.
[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:33.320]   The guy wrote it.
[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:35.320]   He uses 20% Google time.
[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:35.920]   He's on an airplane.
[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:36.920]   He said, "I love writing code."
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:39.120]   He was flying to Asia, so it was like a 16-hour flight.
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:41.920]   He said, "I love writing code on plane flights because nobody bugs me."
[00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:42.520]   Right.
[00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:44.320]   So that's a good reason to go on a long plane flight.
[00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:45.120]   I like it.
[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:49.920]   When they say that they're going to start making cell phones usable on the plane or the Wi-Fi,
[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:51.320]   like, "That's my quiet time."
[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:52.320]   Yeah.
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:53.520]   Now, Apple has Siri.
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:57.720]   I don't know if they've used Siri to do anything yet, but that's the natural language search engine
[00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:58.720]   that does cool things.
[00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:03.120]   Like you could say to your iPhone, "Book me a table for two" at Delafattoria.
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:08.120]   And if Delafattoria has an open table account, it'll just kind of do it automatically.
[00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:10.920]   Google this week announced a similar kind of feature.
[00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:15.320]   They expanded the voice search, which was already in Android phones, to do things like
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:17.720]   navigate to play a song.
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:19.720]   It's kind of like Fort Sink a little bit.
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:20.320]   Right.
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:23.520]   How is Apple going to take Siri and put it in the OS?
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:24.520]   What are they going to do?
[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:25.920]   They just get it for the engineers?
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:27.120]   Well, I hope so.
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:29.120]   I mean, it seems like a nice thing.
[00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:31.520]   I mean, they have a little bit of that already in voice control.
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:33.920]   You can pick up and call mom, sell.
[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:36.120]   And you use that at all on your iPhone?
[00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:40.120]   Well, you don't use that at all, like voice control on the iPhone.
[00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:41.120]   Yeah.
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:42.120]   You know, I try.
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:45.120]   You know, voice control, here's what Android 2, the voice control, it takes too long to get started.
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:46.120]   It's like I'm impatient.
[00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:47.120]   Right.
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:50.120]   So when I'm driving, I use Sink, which is the same thing.
[00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:52.120]   But when I'm walking around, I just press the quick dial.
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.120]   Right.
[00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:55.120]   Or I go to, you know, I go to favorites and just do that.
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:56.120]   It's a lot.
[00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:58.640]   It seems to me that's what I sometimes I just have it like I don't want to get out.
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:00.420]   I don't want to take my phone out and talk.
[00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:02.120]   I just want to just push on the little thing in here.
[00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:06.760]   So you're wearing a Bluetooth or a, you know, I wear this headphone, you wear the the,
[00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:07.760]   the antibiotics.
[00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:08.760]   Yeah, these are the motor.
[00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:10.160]   And you press that twice it does it?
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:11.160]   I don't know.
[00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:13.760]   I just reach into my and I just hold, I just hold onto my iPhone.
[00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:15.440]   I just don't want to pull it out and look at it and everything else.
[00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:18.280]   Just kind of go down here, call Trish sell, right?
[00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:19.280]   Right.
[00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:20.280]   Yeah.
[00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:21.280]   That's like the Ford Sink thing.
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:22.280]   Yeah.
[00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:24.440]   And do you use the voice commands at all?
[00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:29.360]   Not really on the iPhone only because it's so easy to get the, to get the iPhone going.
[00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:31.800]   There's just one mechanical button that's easy to hit.
[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:32.800]   Right.
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:36.640]   I own the only time I even consider using it is when it's on the car mount because it's
[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:37.640]   a safety issue.
[00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:38.640]   Right.
[00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:39.640]   Yeah.
[00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:41.880]   And sometimes you want to like change a track or something with the, with the iPhone, I
[00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:45.360]   think that it's simple enough that really the, the controls are already there on the screen.
[00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:48.880]   I can easily just reach up and tap it and not even, but just like change the station
[00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:49.880]   to my car radio.
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:50.880]   So I don't think it's a safety thing.
[00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:54.760]   And Android, there's so many difficulties in getting anything going, even when the, when
[00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:58.360]   you're just standing still with a thing in your hand on the sidewalk as opposed to operating
[00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:00.560]   a 1500 pound vehicle.
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:02.600]   But I love these, I love Google's voice commands.
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:06.800]   The idea that you tap one mechanical button and say navigate to and then give the name
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:08.840]   of the place and I'll be damned.
[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:12.600]   It will actually, it will actually match the thing you want and just get you there.
[00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:17.000]   It's, it's the sort of thing where you can easily do it in 20 seconds at a stop light.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.240]   As opposed to I'm going to have to pull over to this parking lot and spend two minutes
[00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:22.840]   searching and then plugging something in from here to there.
[00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:25.480]   It really is a signature feature of a, of Android.
[00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:28.680]   When I think that when you, when you, when we, as we get into these interfaces, these
[00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:32.560]   kind of touch interfaces and we're not typing everything in, I think that voice commands
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:33.560]   become more useful.
[00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:35.040]   And I think there's a lot of applications.
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:39.720]   If Apple was able to take that technology and make it really accessible to the app developers,
[00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:45.160]   there's a lot of cool things that could be done to, you know, be able to identify certain
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:48.800]   words because the thing is, is that it like what Dragon does or Mac speech or whatever
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:49.880]   does is very hard.
[00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:52.320]   You know, being able to work through thousands and thousands of words.
[00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:57.880]   But if you only have a hundred commands that are possible, there's a, it's very, it can,
[00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:01.160]   you can have bad audio and an accent and all kinds of other stuff.
[00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:04.680]   And it'll still figure it out because it doesn't have to pick through very much to do
[00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:05.680]   that.
[00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:08.560]   And, but right now it's, I don't think it's, I don't think it's that exposed to the,
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:09.560]   the app developers.
[00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:11.320]   I think we see a lot of cool applications if they did that.
[00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:15.240]   Well, not only that, but I think that it's, it's, I think the users have yet to demonstrate
[00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:17.320]   that they're really interested in that sort of feature.
[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:21.680]   We've had really cool voice command technology for like a decade now and it hasn't really
[00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:23.360]   popped up anywhere.
[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:27.880]   And I think this is the first time that we've seen a mask consumer item that has at least
[00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:31.480]   decided where the makers have at least decided that we're going to make this into an important
[00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:32.480]   feature.
[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:35.800]   Whether then that, that what we need to find out now is are the people actually using it?
[00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:39.040]   Is that actually a way that people want to use this device or not?
[00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:41.080]   I think the right applications would kind of pull people that way.
[00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:43.960]   I think trying to use their current applications that way doesn't make sense.
[00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:48.280]   But like for instance, for me, if I could be doing my workout and just be able to yell
[00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:53.400]   out, you know, like it's, you know, yell out, you know, 50 pounds and 12 reps, you know,
[00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:55.200]   and it would keep track with like awesome.
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:56.200]   Yeah.
[00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:59.840]   You know, it was like a, I think that's just the why, the, the, why things scale.
[00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:00.840]   I do.
[00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:04.280]   The ability for it to track it, you know, because I weigh myself every day, you know, and, and
[00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:07.400]   so it, and it tracks it and I got this great little graph of my, whatever.
[00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:09.880]   And the thing is, is being able to track without having to write stuff down without having
[00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:10.880]   to figure out.
[00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:11.880]   Just automatically.
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:14.760]   And so being able to have a workout where you had a schedule and be able to just call
[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:19.040]   out that stuff, what a mean all sweaty and trying to hit it and that kind of thing would
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:20.040]   be really useful.
[00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:23.440]   But it's, it's, it's the sort of thing where needs to be a cultural ship.
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:28.800]   There was a time in which the idea of being someone who walks around holding a PDA in
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:32.280]   your hand and just at the street corner while they're walking, why are you doing this?
[00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:33.280]   Why are you doing that?
[00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:36.760]   That sort of mark us really just a marginal social broadcast.
[00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:39.960]   But now that's, you know, you're being honest.
[00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:40.960]   Yeah.
[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:43.760]   And so I have to, I mean, people like us would say, well, why wouldn't we want to do this?
[00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:44.760]   I don't care what people think.
[00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:47.560]   It's actually a cool device and it's a great way to do things.
[00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:51.360]   You'd have to have that same sort of cultural shift for, I think, for head for earpieces,
[00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:55.480]   where I just don't want to be the sort of person who has a thing in their ear every single
[00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:56.480]   moment.
[00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:59.680]   And any time you're talking to somebody, you see this little blue light flashing.
[00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:03.560]   It says, okay, I have, I have maximum 20% of your attention right now, sir.
[00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:05.600]   And thank you for any of this conversation early.
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:09.080]   I think we need that kind of, that same kind of a shift where either the microphones for
[00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:13.520]   this are integrated so well, or you have to train people to be a culture that wants
[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:15.280]   to wear a headpiece wherever they go.
[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:16.280]   We're getting there.
[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:17.600]   You know, bad news.
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:22.440]   I try to, I have to try to always remind myself not to, or to take my headset out because
[00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:25.880]   I have bad habit of listening to audio books or NPR or music or whatever.
[00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:28.280]   And I still have one in there because I'm, you know, I'm answering the phone or whatever.
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:30.480]   It seems anti-social when you walk around like that.
[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:32.120]   Well, I'm usually listening to it actually.
[00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:35.720]   I just like to tell you as your friend, it actually seems a little creepy, frankly.
[00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:37.720]   Well, it seems like you're not listening to me.
[00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:38.720]   No, I'm just kidding.
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:40.560]   That's what my kids say to me all the time.
[00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:43.200]   But you know, I have to admit, I walk around all, today I was at the gym.
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:47.040]   I was head down into the phone and the trainer said, "You're going to kill yourself one of
[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:48.040]   these things.
[00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:49.040]   You better stop doing that."
[00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:52.560]   And I, you know, I really forget that I view, and maybe more and more we're all doing this,
[00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:53.560]   live in our phone.
[00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:58.480]   I notice a lot of people walking around whether they've got earbuds or not, but they're living
[00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:00.800]   in this phone as they walk around in life.
[00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:04.120]   You know, the phone becomes their personal pal, their plastic pal.
[00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:05.120]   Yeah.
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:06.120]   It was easy to be with.
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:10.360]   Let's take a little break, we're talking about Macintosh and Apple.
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:13.560]   We haven't talked about Macintosh lately.
[00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:15.640]   That's because it hasn't a lot happening.
[00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:18.160]   There was a new Mac.
[00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:19.160]   Yes.
[00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:21.800]   Okay, well, there was our Macintosh conversation.
[00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:24.920]   We'll be back with more iPhone conversation, I guess.
[00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:26.920]   And iPad too, just a little bit.
[00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:29.160]   Alex Lindsey's here, Andy and not Gomley all the port.
[00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:32.240]   And of course, we want to thank our friends at Squarespace for providing the wear with
[00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:33.600]   all to make this show possible.
[00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:35.680]   We love Squarespace.
[00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:37.520]   I know Alex is using it like crazy.
[00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:39.120]   We're using it for our inside Twit blog.
[00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:43.560]   And I got to get off my duff because I want to move the radio show.
[00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:46.680]   It's one of the few platforms I really feel like I could move the radio show site to.
[00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:47.680]   For a couple of reasons.
[00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:54.200]   One is their VPS technology makes it very easy to add bandwidth as needed.
[00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:56.840]   You don't have to ask for it, it just happens.
[00:18:56.840 --> 00:19:01.160]   And boy, when you have a site, a big commercial site and you're worried about, oh boy, can
[00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:05.240]   I send a million radio listeners there, it's really nice to know you've got the Squarespace
[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:06.240]   infrastructure behind you.
[00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:12.800]   Squarespace is both a web hosting company and a software company.
[00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:16.520]   So they do the content management system that you're running.
[00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:20.400]   And I'll tell you, that's the first thing you notice on Squarespace is how gorgeous it
[00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:26.200]   is and all the nice features, the ability to post via iPhone, the ability to import
[00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:30.680]   and export content from movable type, WordPress type pad or blogger.
[00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:34.680]   I was just talking to a web developer, actually someone who's done a lot of big websites
[00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:37.280]   and he's kind of getting out of the business.
[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:39.680]   And he said, it's just like, you know, this is too easy for people to do.
[00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:41.720]   Well, he said, he said, when people ask me now what they want to do, I say, I just go
[00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:42.720]   to Squarespace.
[00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:43.720]   Really?
[00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:47.400]   Yeah, no, he said, if you want a big site, you know, you still want to develop it, but
[00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:52.160]   for small businesses, for individuals, photographers, you know, when you just want to put it up,
[00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:57.120]   like for me with my blog, you know, I don't want to, I don't have a big staff to work on
[00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:01.560]   my blog, you know, and I just want it to be up and I want to be able to edit things.
[00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:03.720]   And there's just nothing like Squarespace to do that.
[00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:08.920]   And to date dollars a month for the full deal, the full money, the community site, which gives
[00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:11.960]   you multiple editors and all sorts, you know, different audiences.
[00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:13.480]   I have to play with this audience idea.
[00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:16.720]   This is a new idea to me that you have the different, different audience gets a different
[00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:18.240]   site in effect.
[00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:20.520]   $50 a month most, but here's the deal.
[00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:26.560]   If you use Mac break as a promo code for the rest of your life, for the life of the site,
[00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:28.760]   you will save 10%.
[00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:34.560]   So, you know, that's anywhere from 80 cents a month to five bucks a month forever.
[00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:38.160]   Squarespace, great designs, easy to use.
[00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:41.240]   You can get as deep or as shallow as you want and still have a great site.
[00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:45.840]   Once you give them a try, go to squarespace.com/macbreak to try it free for 15 days, no credit
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:47.120]   card needed.
[00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:53.560]   And if you decide to buy, use the coupon code Macbreak to save 10% off the life of your
[00:20:53.560 --> 00:21:00.120]   fee for the life of the site, which is really, really awesome squarespace.com/macbreak.
[00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:06.080]   So there's been a little kerfuffle going on, a little fighting over I ads and whether people,
[00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:09.160]   it's a success, I think it's really a little too early to say whether it's a success or
[00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:10.160]   failure.
[00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:17.200]   But a lot of people are saying that there are few I ad campaigns, there are complaints
[00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:19.520]   about Apple.
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:21.000]   Are you surprised?
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.840]   Building on whether your creative is appropriate for the iPhone or not, they want it to look
[00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:25.840]   really great.
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:34.280]   I don't, you know, look, I'm at the point now where I'm saying we all have a choice.
[00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:39.760]   And if you choose the Apple platform, it's because you buy the Apple way, which is aesthetic,
[00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:44.200]   elegant, full control by Apple so that they could preserve the user experience.
[00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:45.200]   That's just the way it is.
[00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:47.240]   If you make that choice, don't bitch about it.
[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:50.560]   Well, and I think that the other thing is, is that what Apple is looking at, I think
[00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:54.240]   appropriately to some degree, I don't know whether this is really going to work in the
[00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:59.040]   long term, but is that if a lot of bad ads come out in the I ad format and people will
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:01.280]   stop, it affects the entire network.
[00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:06.160]   That's the issue is that bad ads, you know, affect all the whole network and makes it,
[00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:10.600]   you know, the, you know, I use, I have tight control over what we do on advertising.
[00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:11.600]   It's appropriate.
[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:12.600]   Right.
[00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:16.400]   And so I think that they want to make sure that they, that, and the advertisers that,
[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:20.520]   and I have to go find the data, it was not in this Wall Street Journal ad.
[00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:24.160]   And I think that's the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the advertisers who have made it
[00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:28.160]   onto the platform, who have gotten through the, the LA Times say that Nissan and Unilever,
[00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:30.000]   both of which ads I've seen, I've been very happy.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   I've been very happy.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.400]   It's five or six times more likely that someone's going to, uh, to, to, to click on
[00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:36.400]   that ad.
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:39.000]   And I think that that's the, that's what Apple is trying to move towards.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.760]   And yeah, it's going to take longer to develop and it's going to, it's takes eight to 10
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:45.520]   weeks, I guess is what people are saying to get your creative through the system, which
[00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:49.800]   is a little weird to have to get the creative approved, but Godly, I mean, it eliminates
[00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:52.280]   the punch, the monkey stuff, the stupid stuff.
[00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:54.520]   I think I don't have a problem with that at all.
[00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:55.680]   No, I don't either.
[00:22:55.680 --> 00:23:01.680]   Uh, according to the LA Times, uh, Nissan, which created a multi-layer interactive ad
[00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:06.720]   for its electric leaf car, said customers spent an average of 90 seconds with the ad
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:11.960]   10 times longer than interaction times are comparable online ads.
[00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:16.520]   And people chose, as you said, to click five times more frequently than another online
[00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:17.520]   display.
[00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:19.600]   And that leaf, that leaf, that was very effective for me.
[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:22.000]   But it was, are you, are you able to get one?
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   I don't know.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   I put my money down.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   Yeah.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.240]   And by the way, it was looking at that ad.
[00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:27.240]   It's pretty subtle.
[00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:29.680]   It does not, it never, I was a little concerned because, you know, Steve talked about how
[00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:34.200]   we're going to serve a billion impressions and it sounded like a lot of ads and, and
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:37.160]   that they were going to be full screen, but they're small ads.
[00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:39.080]   If you don't click on them, they just sit there.
[00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:40.240]   They don't bother me at all.
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:41.240]   Yeah.
[00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:42.240]   Yeah.
[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:45.600]   But see, the, the problem is that the leaf has so effective because, because the ad agency
[00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:49.360]   seemed to build an entire app, it's like they built an entire iPhone application.
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:50.360]   Right.
[00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:52.960]   Just to make it just to give you a fun, well, whoever does.
[00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:57.280]   So not, not every advertiser is going to have the sort of budget or interest in doing that
[00:23:57.280 --> 00:24:00.600]   kind of a sophisticated, multi-leveled experience.
[00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:03.560]   They really just want to say, we've got photocopiers.
[00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:05.000]   They're on really good discount.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.440]   We got them only for two weeks.
[00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:10.320]   Come and go come and buy some and they can't just get, well, here's a photocopier simulator.
[00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:13.800]   And here, here we can pretend and pretend to put your bum on the top of it and make a
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:15.560]   photocopy and send it to a friend.
[00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:18.200]   They just want to say, here, we have photocopiers.
[00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:19.200]   They're good photocopiers.
[00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:21.360]   They're an expensive photocopiers.
[00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:22.360]   Please let us tell you photocopiers.
[00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:26.360]   Well, I think Apple's trying to avoid having those types of ads on their network.
[00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:29.120]   I mean, I think it's just, you know, that, to make it harder.
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:33.920]   The idea is, is that I think when we look at the, the Apple ads, the old spice ad, you
[00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:38.120]   know, if every ad was like the Apple ads or the old spice ads, people would watch all
[00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:39.120]   the ads.
[00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:43.920]   Like, when, when the, when the Steelers aren't playing in the Super Bowl, the only reason
[00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:45.640]   that I watch is because of the ads.
[00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:48.480]   You know, in fact, I just fast forward, like it behind and I'm not skipping, I'm skipping
[00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:49.480]   the game.
[00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:50.480]   You know, I get to the next day.
[00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:51.480]   Let me get this straight.
[00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:55.000]   Cause you, if you're a developer of an iPhone app, you don't have to use iAds to you.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.520]   You could use another ad platform.
[00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:57.520]   Is that right?
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:58.520]   Uh, you, yes.
[00:24:58.520 --> 00:24:59.720]   Yeah, you can.
[00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:03.560]   So it's, it's not, it's even better than, than you have, you know, Apple's where the highway,
[00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:04.760]   you don't even have to choose I ads.
[00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:07.160]   But if you choose I ads, let me get this straight.
[00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:08.760]   Apple designs the ad.
[00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:09.760]   They work with the company.
[00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:12.200]   The company, they work with the, they, they build the ad.
[00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:16.880]   So they, they actually, you, you work with their, you, you can do the creative design,
[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:19.440]   but they're going to build the whole thing into the iAd platform.
[00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:20.440]   You're not going to do any.
[00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:25.600]   Tony Bradley writing in PC world says he interviewed Grace Dripes, a director of marketing, Dane
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:32.880]   Holowinsky, said, quote, the fact that they require HTML5 and design the ads themselves
[00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:35.680]   may prove a proof problematic on the scaling side.
[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:36.680]   And that's true.
[00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:40.160]   Agencies and advertisers often want to have control over the creative process, which
[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:41.640]   Apple doesn't give them.
[00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:44.440]   Additionally, being on a single platform limits their ability to scale.
[00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:46.680]   You know, you write an ad for the iPhone.
[00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:49.040]   It's, that's, that's it iPhone and iPad.
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:53.240]   And it's, it's a, there's a whole world out there besides iPhone and ad, and, and iPad.
[00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:58.800]   What advertisers want says Holowinsky are audiences, not platforms.
[00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:00.160]   There are many millions of users.
[00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:01.280]   Apple can't reach.
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:06.360]   There may be a successful, they may be successful in filling a niche, but there will always be
[00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:08.320]   needs for other solutions to reach mobile.
[00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:13.320]   I think that's true.
[00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:14.320]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:18.640]   I think that Apple is going to be successful by defining their own version of the word
[00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:19.640]   success.
[00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:23.560]   It's not going to be by stealing an incredible amount of audience and influence away from
[00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:24.560]   Google AdSense.
[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:30.000]   It's going to be by producing a brand new business to a brand new sector of advertisers
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.080]   that feel as though that they can do things with the Apple platform.
[00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:34.080]   They can't do through Google.
[00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:37.400]   Well, I think that the fact that these are high quality ads makes them also much more.
[00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:40.320]   We're looking at building an app that when you can look at our, watch our content and
[00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:43.120]   then you see the ad, you know, showing up below it.
[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:45.720]   Because what I know is that, you know, I, and I don't do that at all.
[00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:50.560]   Like if you go to pixacorda, well, like pixorta TV has one, one banner ad or whatever, but
[00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:53.840]   generally like on the pix score sites on the, on loss of, I've always been kind of anti
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:57.840]   display ads, you know, like there's one display ad that we put up and that, that was kind
[00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:00.800]   of that was, that took me a couple of years to get to.
[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:01.800]   But I feel comfortable.
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:04.480]   I don't want to give Google that control because I know I'll get all kinds of crazy ads
[00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:05.480]   that go in there.
[00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:08.560]   If I give it to Apple, I know they'll be cool ads.
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:10.360]   They'll be cool manufacturers.
[00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:11.360]   They'll be cool ads.
[00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:15.200]   You know, I know that when we added, for instance, I stock photo as a, as an advertiser
[00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:18.440]   a couple of years ago, I felt like their ad was better than our show.
[00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:19.440]   Yeah.
[00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:22.960]   It was, you know, it was like, you know, it's not good, but, but I was, but I was, you
[00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:26.760]   know, the, the thing is, is that, is that I was like, but I was excited about, you know,
[00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:32.080]   putting that ad on because it was, you know, it brought the production quality up rather
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:33.080]   than down.
[00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:36.680]   I think that that's what these, you know, provide an opportunity to do.
[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:42.680]   Loic Le Muir in his blog, he's a guy, he's a guy, says that a number of developers are
[00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:47.480]   moving away from pay daps to free apps.
[00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:49.440]   I mean, this is the key, I think.
[00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:52.120]   There's a ton of free apps on the, on the Android side.
[00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:55.720]   Some say that's just because it's so hard to make it a pay app because it's, you know,
[00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:57.800]   it's kind of a complicated situation.
[00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:01.920]   But others say, and there's even a, you know, John Gruber even said, maybe there's a conspiracy
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:05.240]   theory here that Google makes it hard to get a paid app because they'd love you to use
[00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:08.040]   ads and do ad supported app.
[00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:09.040]   Right.
[00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:12.720]   Uh, Louis quotes some app store revenue stats.
[00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:18.440]   Uh, it says Apple may have managed 5 billion application downloads and 1.5 billion in revenue
[00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:23.360]   through the end of June 2010 spread over 200,000 applications.
[00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:27.120]   But these aren't the important numbers more relevant to the indie developer.
[00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:32.240]   And I wanted to make a quick buck is the stat that 50% of paid applications, 50% received
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:39.120]   fewer than 1,000 downloads with an average price of a buck 99 to $3.83 depending on who's
[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:41.640]   doing the, I think I'm actually surprised that number is that high.
[00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:47.520]   I mean, 50% Oh no, I, I, so 50% are making 2500 bucks per app or less.
[00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:48.520]   Yeah.
[00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:51.680]   But I mean, that when you look at any, any mass market, uh, when you, you're talking, I
[00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:55.160]   mean, it's when we, the music market for instance, it's always that way.
[00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:56.680]   It's hit two percent, three percent.
[00:28:56.680 --> 00:29:02.360]   I mean, look at podcasts, there's 60,000 podcasts, but, but 90% of all of the people are watching,
[00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:03.720]   you know, 10% of them.
[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:04.960]   Right.
[00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:08.280]   So it, there is a, there is a drive if you can make, can you make more money, you think
[00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:09.720]   an advertising based apps?
[00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:10.720]   I don't know.
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:12.040]   I think it's, I think it's just a different model.
[00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:16.120]   I think if you look at your audience and say that it's big enough that I think ads can
[00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:19.200]   serve it, I look at it as just another way to generate revenue.
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:21.440]   I don't look at it as an either or kind of thing.
[00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:24.800]   You can make a free version that has ads supported and a, that introduces people to
[00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:27.600]   your technology and then a paid version that, that doesn't have any ads.
[00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:33.800]   Low weeks says people are making 10 to 30 cents per user per month, uh, on average,
[00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:36.600]   on the advertising on the advertising.
[00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:42.600]   So that might just pay for a developer 30 cents per user per month, 10 to 30 cents.
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:45.600]   Boy, I need to do that.
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:46.600]   Yeah.
[00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:50.200]   I'm also, I'm, I'm applying through a lot of money.
[00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:51.200]   That's a lot of money.
[00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:52.200]   Yeah.
[00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:53.800]   That's more, that's more than we're making on our advertising now.
[00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:57.560]   I mean, you know, that's a, if you think about the Twit Network and how big it is.
[00:29:57.560 --> 00:29:58.560]   Yeah.
[00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:02.600]   Well, if we could get, you know, millions of users, you're, you're happy.
[00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:07.320]   So do you think then because of this that, uh, if they, if they make eye ads a little
[00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:12.640]   more accessible, if Google's ad mob continues to do well, that eventually most apps will
[00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:13.640]   be free.
[00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:16.520]   No, I think it just depends on the market.
[00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:21.240]   I think that, I think that that'll definitely come into like the, the fun and the wacky apps.
[00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:24.760]   But if you're taking out your iPhone to do something productive, you don't want part
[00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:29.960]   of your screen being given up to even to see, you know, high profile ads from the body shop
[00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:30.960]   or whatever.
[00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:33.800]   So I don't, I don't think that we'll take, we'll, they'll change the existence of that
[00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:34.800]   much.
[00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:36.040]   And I think there's no question that apps are important.
[00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:39.320]   You know, we just, uh, Goldman Sachs just said that the, the new BlackBerry, the torch
[00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:43.280]   with its BlackBerry operating system six and its beautiful screen is, is kind of a flop
[00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:45.200]   that every store has plenty of stock.
[00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:47.000]   They're not sold out by any means.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:52.600]   Uh, whereas both Apple iPhones, uh, they're, you keep hard to get and the, the, the top
[00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:57.880]   of the line Android phones like the Droid X, uh, and the Sprint Evo very hard to get.
[00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:00.240]   Um, and if you ask me, what's the difference?
[00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:01.240]   It's apps, isn't it?
[00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:03.360]   Between BlackBerry, Android and, and iPhone, it's apps.
[00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:06.640]   If you don't have a, a very robust app application interface.
[00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:08.520]   Well, I think we're, I think we're very quick.
[00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:11.360]   This is something you guys were touching on on Twitter, uh, on Sunday, but I think that
[00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:17.280]   we're moving very, very quickly towards a, an internet enabled, but, but non-web environment.
[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:19.240]   Yeah, which really scares the hell out of me.
[00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:21.160]   I mean, that's what the Google Verizon thinks all about.
[00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:24.200]   I guess what I'd argue, well, no, but I mean, regardless of Google and Verizon, whether,
[00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:26.760]   regardless of that, what they're doing, it's a gated tower.
[00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:27.760]   It's a tower of Babel.
[00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:30.040]   It's, it's that it is and it's a gated community.
[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:35.360]   It's a, you know, there's is there, but what I'm saying is is regardless of, of net neutrality,
[00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:37.800]   what you're looking at is people are moving away from the web.
[00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:39.040]   They're moving more and more into this.
[00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:43.600]   Like I'm not looking at, like when I'm looking at our, our, uh, uh, I'm not on the web looking
[00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:48.240]   at our articles, I'm in reader, you know, on my iPad looking at the articles, you know,
[00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:50.520]   I'm, I'm, I'm accessing the internet.
[00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:51.520]   That's what I do too.
[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:52.520]   And database.
[00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:56.400]   I'm not what I'm not doing is, is necessarily, um, using the web browser.
[00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:58.640]   You know, I'm almost always, when I use, you know, I take it back.
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:02.400]   When I look at an article, I almost always go to the web page of the article.
[00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:06.080]   But like, so like if I, if I listen to NPR, I'm listening from the NPR app.
[00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:08.960]   I'm not going to the NPR, um, not on the website.
[00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:14.440]   No, no, but I'm saying when I use reader or I even use pulse or flip board, I will almost
[00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:17.560]   always press that web button partly because I want a bookmark and I'm delicious, but also
[00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:20.200]   because I want to read the full thing or I want to insta paper or the full thing.
[00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:22.080]   You're still doing it from within this application.
[00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:25.960]   Yeah, but it's, but it doesn't matter if you're launching, you know, a web kit interface
[00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:29.760]   from the application, you are surfing the public med at that point.
[00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:30.760]   How, what's the difference?
[00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:31.760]   No, no, you're surfing the net.
[00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:34.880]   But what I'm saying is that we're not following the same browser rules that we had before.
[00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:37.760]   Like we have, we have what it is is we have a dozen browsers now.
[00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:40.960]   Every application has its own browser built in, but that's still on, at least on the iPhone
[00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:43.040]   and the iPad, that's still Safari.
[00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:45.960]   But it changes the model for instance with advertising because like when you're in reader
[00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:49.200]   and you're reading the articles, there's no ads.
[00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:52.800]   Well, they're, they're, they're, that depends on the RSS.
[00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:53.800]   Yeah.
[00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:54.800]   Right.
[00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:55.800]   Yeah.
[00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:58.360]   As always, as always, you just have to adapt your business model and adapt your ad mechanism
[00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:01.520]   to however people are actually reading your content.
[00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:06.760]   And if anything, if you, if Google reader gives you greater access and greater access
[00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:08.640]   to readers, then that's got to be a good thing.
[00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:10.480]   You got to definitely how to adapt.
[00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:15.240]   And I think the, the, the fundamental question, and this is that Google Verizon question again,
[00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:20.200]   is are these apps going to channel people away from the public web?
[00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:25.360]   Are you going to start having your full experience of the internet within an app instead of
[00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:27.320]   web surfing?
[00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:28.320]   That's, I know what you're saying.
[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:30.360]   I think that's, and I think that's the case.
[00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:34.160]   You know, I think, and I think that's not a good thing because I think the link economy,
[00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:37.240]   free and open web, all of those things are really kind of important.
[00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:44.880]   You know, if I create a Leoville, you know, blog, that's a website, I guess, to any point,
[00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:48.000]   I don't mind if people read it on reader, but I do want people to go to the page.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:53.920]   I guess my answer is it seems, it seems like the, it seems like the lingua franca of sharing
[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:58.120]   links between any two services and any two apps is still going to be the actual website.
[00:33:58.120 --> 00:33:59.760]   It's just not possible.
[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:04.120]   It's not easily possible for me to recommend someone's webpage to somebody else via Twitter
[00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:06.560]   and send them into Google Reader.
[00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:09.920]   It has to be, it has to send them to the actual webpage itself.
[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:14.040]   So given that so much of the money that you can make on the web these days is based on
[00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:17.680]   the ability to create something that lots of people are going to link to and share from
[00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:23.040]   every social media site out there, that immediate webpage is still going to be the most important
[00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:25.520]   atom of getting brand new users.
[00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:29.560]   Now getting people to keep coming back, that's always going to be the province of making
[00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:33.280]   sure that people can access your content any way that they want, whether it's through
[00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:36.720]   Google Reader, whether it's through a dedicated app, whether it's through making sure that
[00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:41.200]   your robots.txt file will allow apps like Flipboard right in, but it will always be
[00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:46.200]   your first face and your first interaction with a brand new reader is always going to
[00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:48.000]   be through your actual webpage.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:49.840]   Here's the question.
[00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:52.880]   And I'm not saying that this is good or bad because I don't know.
[00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:58.360]   But what I do think is this is the trend, which is that also if you look at, you know,
[00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:01.440]   for instance Rupert Murdoch doesn't want to give away free content, aren't they going
[00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:04.320]   to use the web to pull people towards them?
[00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:10.600]   And then once they get you, they want to pull you into a private area that is separate
[00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:15.960]   from the web, that is moving you out of that system.
[00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:19.840]   We might find out about these applications online, but then are we going to be more likely
[00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:24.160]   to use the applications within away from the web?
[00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:27.840]   And I do think that it's a dangerous thing, but I think that also the web is, you know,
[00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:31.160]   as someone who has to develop for it, I mean, our entire business sits on the web, is
[00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:34.720]   frustrating, you know, trying to deal with all, you know, trying to deal with the lowest
[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:39.040]   combat and nominator of every web browser is part of what makes it people like me want
[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:40.040]   to write applications.
[00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:45.960]   Yeah, but actually that's a really good example that you cite because Wall Street Journal
[00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:50.440]   is probably the biggest and most famous newspaper that went behind a paywall.
[00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:54.720]   But their philosophy has always been that you have to, you have to get behind a paywall
[00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:58.680]   to get to our front page and to navigate using our site structure.
[00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:02.680]   If you want to send readers to any one of our articles, be our guests, by all means.
[00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:07.440]   Here's an open link because if you need to, if you link to an individual article or if
[00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:11.480]   you follow a link to an individual article, that's not going to cost anybody any money.
[00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:15.960]   And ideally what they're with their very smart idea is that hopefully someone will get that
[00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:20.080]   free content recommended by a friend, they'll start wondering what else is the third or
[00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:23.440]   the fourth really cool Wall Street Journal article that I've seen.
[00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:26.320]   Babies can be worth subscribing for a month to see how well it goes.
[00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:29.800]   Yeah, I mean, part of this will tie into my pick of the week this week.
[00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:34.960]   But I think part of the new reality of publishing the 21st century is you have to let go of
[00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:38.760]   the idea that you can control the presentation to your readers.
[00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:44.600]   That's possible in some avenues, but if it is possible to publish, to always be thinking
[00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:49.280]   in terms of, we're just going to make the content as flexible and reflowable as possible
[00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:53.760]   so that no matter what device and what application this user is going to be reading it on, they
[00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:56.240]   can make that choice and read it wherever they want.
[00:36:56.240 --> 00:37:01.480]   That's going to give you more power than simply saying, we're going to have to, let's add
[00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:05.000]   something to robots.txt to make sure that unless you get this load in our fonts and our
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.800]   pictures and our format, you're not allowed to see our pictures.
[00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:13.760]   Byron in the chat room says I'm conflating open with HTTP versus other IP protocols.
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:15.480]   No, it's not about the protocol level.
[00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:17.440]   It's at the higher, it's at the content level.
[00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:22.040]   And it's the, it's, you know, Virginia Heffernan wrote a very now become very famous article
[00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:27.440]   in the Sunday Times about two months ago in which he said apps are like the gated community
[00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:33.200]   of the internet versus the downtown, which is the web, the free flowing web.
[00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:36.280]   And she says, yeah, on the free flowing web, things happen.
[00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:41.040]   You get, you know, you get bums, you get bars, you get fights, you get weird stuff happening.
[00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:44.600]   The apps put you in this gated community where the experience is controlled, you know,
[00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:46.240]   flip boards are a very good example.
[00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:52.840]   It's a beautiful, safe experience is the, there's no porno here, version of the internet and
[00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:56.160]   also give me, give me 10 seconds.
[00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:58.200]   I'll give you a version of flip book that has lots of porn.
[00:37:58.200 --> 00:37:59.200]   I guess you're right.
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:00.200]   I guess you're right.
[00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:01.200]   You can follow a point of a list.
[00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:02.760]   You'd get it all, wouldn't you?
[00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:03.760]   Yeah.
[00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:07.080]   Flipboards, bad example, because it's never, it really wasn't, that wasn't designed nor
[00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:09.720]   as it suited to be the one app that you read everything in.
[00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:11.960]   It's just one app like all your links and you're right.
[00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:15.040]   You still have to go to the actual website in order to read the actual article.
[00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:20.720]   Let's say the USA Today app on the iPad, for instance, or the BBC app, that would be a
[00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:21.720]   better, you're right.
[00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:23.960]   That'd be a better gated community example.
[00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:27.320]   And I think that that's a legitimate point and I think it's bad for the, I believe it's
[00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:30.800]   bad for the internet if we start living inside these apps instead of.
[00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:34.600]   But do you find yourself using more and more of these apps to gather that information?
[00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:38.640]   You know, an interesting thing has kind of happened to me and I'm curious if other people
[00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:43.120]   have, you know, I was a big iPad proponent and I still believe the iPad that's clear
[00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:48.320]   from sales numbers is a huge breakthrough in computing.
[00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:52.240]   But I find myself more and more going back to my Mac book, more and more and more.
[00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:54.600]   I feel like the, I feel like the functionality is constrained.
[00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:59.360]   I feel like my wrists are tied a little bit in this app environment and I find myself using
[00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:01.280]   the Note Pucka more.
[00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:02.280]   Cut and paste.
[00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:03.280]   That's the big thing.
[00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:04.280]   Delicious.
[00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:07.640]   Well, for instance, I bookmark a lot of stories on Delicious for this show and other shows.
[00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:10.800]   What I do is I select a salient paragraph from it.
[00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:15.200]   I hit Pucka, Pucka, and all of that stuff is very easy to do on a notebook computer,
[00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:16.600]   much, much harder to do.
[00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:19.520]   It's just a few extra steps, but it's a pain.
[00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:22.360]   It's a live bookmark doesn't work for you.
[00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:27.240]   It does, but then it opens up the delicious interface and then I have to copy and paste
[00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:31.480]   into it using the very awkward, well, to get this parag, the salient paragraph thing
[00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:32.480]   in.
[00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:33.480]   I have to cut and paste.
[00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:34.480]   There's a, it's just easier.
[00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:35.480]   I don't know.
[00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:38.840]   Email a lot of things for me have become easier going back to the notebook.
[00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:42.720]   Maybe I'm just, it could very well be I'm a dinosaur, that I'm not.
[00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:47.040]   I find myself, when I'm doing research for the shows, I find myself back on my laptop
[00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:49.480]   because I can't, it just, it is the same thing.
[00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:50.480]   Productive work seems difficult.
[00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:51.480]   If I want to brown.
[00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:52.480]   It's easy for me to farm.
[00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:53.480]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:58.560]   But that's really, I mean, that just goes to show that the iPad was always designed to
[00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:01.920]   be something other than a notebook and something other than a notebook.
[00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:07.160]   I mean, because they're, like this morning, I was reading up for the show and also catching
[00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:08.920]   up on news.
[00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:15.480]   And typically it's, I've got my lovely brisket sandwich left over from last night, you know,
[00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:16.960]   but my soda, I'm on the table.
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:20.400]   I really don't, now I'm at the point after six months that I don't really want to do
[00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:21.400]   that on my notebook.
[00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:25.320]   I want to hold this in my hand and have this lovely sheet of paper in front of me because
[00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:29.880]   it's a much better reading device and a much better interactive device than the notebook
[00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:31.880]   is.
[00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:35.920]   It's also okay for content creation, but I really think that it has been farmed out.
[00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:38.920]   It's own special niche in your order of battle.
[00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:39.920]   So to speak.
[00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:40.920]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:43.160]   And to me, you know, it comes back to what I said originally about the iPad.
[00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:44.400]   First one, I first saw it and came out.
[00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:47.560]   I always thought of as a consumption device, almost a personal TV.
[00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:49.120]   It works very well at that level.
[00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:51.600]   It's a little tough to create with it.
[00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:52.600]   And you can do it.
[00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:57.040]   And obviously, Apple believes given that they've got, you know, pages and numbers and keynote
[00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:59.760]   on here believes that this is a productivity tool.
[00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:03.320]   And certainly other people have put a lot of productivity apps on it.
[00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:05.000]   But you know, Francis Omni focus.
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   They use Omni focus.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:09.880]   It's so much easier for me to use it in the notebook and have this be a read only version
[00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:11.800]   of on the iPad and the iPhone, right?
[00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:16.520]   And so the iPad definitely does demonstrate the limitations of any one window interface,
[00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:20.520]   especially when it's a one window interface that doesn't even let you tile windows.
[00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:23.560]   You did there a lot of things for which you do need to have two things open at the same
[00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:24.560]   time.
[00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:29.160]   I've been looking at word processors over the past week, both ones that already been released
[00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:32.640]   and ones that are coming up and thinking that I hate to say this.
[00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:37.760]   But if we had the ability to have one narrow column in landscape mode, one narrow column
[00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:43.000]   on the side that I could at my own option, put in my put in any Twitter feed of my choice,
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:48.040]   Google reader of my choice, like any two iPhone apps, let's say stack one on top of
[00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:51.360]   the other and one narrow column and still be running an iPad application.
[00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:56.640]   And the other side, that would solve 90% of any of my remaining complaints about the iPad.
[00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:59.320]   But it is designed to be, I think, a different user experience.
[00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:00.320]   That's it.
[00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:03.880]   Frankly, let's say this is the appeal of it to a lot of people, including older people,
[00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:06.720]   people who are not computer enthusiasts, people who just want to consume.
[00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:08.120]   People who don't want to use the web.
[00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:10.320]   They just want to get whatever they want, whatever they're interested in.
[00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:11.800]   I guess that's the point of apps.
[00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:15.840]   I'm kind of expanding this app argument that really that's the point of apps too, that
[00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:20.000]   I'm starting to feel more, and this is actually something I've noticed in the last few months,
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:25.760]   more and more anachronistic, more and more like the old school computer user and less
[00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:31.880]   and less of the modern app consuming iPad user.
[00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:33.120]   But I mean, like this is a good example.
[00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:34.120]   This is Epicurious.
[00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:35.120]   I love that site.
[00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:36.120]   We've plugged it on iPad today.
[00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:37.120]   It's a beautiful site.
[00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:39.040]   And the thing is, is that it's, but it's their app.
[00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:42.800]   I use their application all the time in the kitchen because I don't want to deal with
[00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:44.040]   all the other stuff I just want.
[00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:45.040]   That gives me the interface to their information.
[00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:46.520]   It's a beautiful cookbook.
[00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:51.600]   And the thing is, is that I find that I do want them to have control over how that works
[00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:52.600]   and how it looks.
[00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:54.160]   It's just as a cookbook would.
[00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:57.800]   You wouldn't expect a cookbook to have the vast universe of recipes in it.
[00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:00.160]   You have the vetted recipes and how to make them.
[00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:04.400]   But you know what's interesting about that Epicurious application is they apparently consciously
[00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:09.200]   made the decision not to link back to your Epicurious.com account.
[00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:11.840]   You can have an account there, save recipes, do all sorts of stuff.
[00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:12.840]   It doesn't link to it.
[00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:13.840]   Interesting.
[00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:15.320]   Well, and I like the fact that they designed it.
[00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:17.880]   You know, for me, this is a lot of, you know, the difference between the Winnie the Pooh
[00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:23.440]   app that comes with the iBooks and the Dr. Seuss books that you can buy on iTunes.
[00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:25.680]   You know, I talked about the Dr. Seuss stuff last week.
[00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:27.720]   My son is crazy about the Dr. Seuss books.
[00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:29.760]   You know, and part of it is a cool book.
[00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:33.080]   Well, they're coming out one after another where I'm going to have all the Dr. Seuss
[00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:35.440]   on an iPad that he can sit there and go through.
[00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:38.600]   And the thing is, is that that shows you the advantage of designing something from scratch.
[00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:42.080]   You know, not just saying the text is going to flow anyway, it's going to flow and the
[00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:43.920]   images are going to be wherever they're going to be.
[00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:50.600]   You know, it is a designed, a curated experience of Dr. Seuss, which, to be honest with you,
[00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:52.080]   is better than the book.
[00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:55.760]   I mean, you know, and that's the thing that I think that's the opportunity that I think
[00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:59.120]   some developers are starting to see of developing their own applications for.
[00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:02.480]   And then I'm going to channel my friend, Jeff Jarvis here, who's the keeper of the keys
[00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:05.760]   of the link economy and the open internet.
[00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:09.720]   And I think he sees content creators flocking to the iPad because it's a way to hold on
[00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:13.600]   to their old-fashioned model of you buy this bundle of stuff it's are as it doesn't interact
[00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:16.680]   with anything else and you can't be stolen and all of that stuff.
[00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:19.280]   And he's worried about that.
[00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:23.960]   Not only that, but the idea that the creator cannot possibly be the creator of everything,
[00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:28.400]   that you still need to have the full support of a designer and editor, a layout guy, a
[00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:29.400]   copy editor.
[00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:32.960]   You still need this big team of people to produce something that will correspond as
[00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:39.400]   professional thing as opposed to the ePub dichotomy, which is essentially that if you
[00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:44.560]   have the sort of determination and insanity necessary to write a 60 to 100,000 page novel,
[00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:48.880]   you probably also have the determination and insanity necessary to produce a very professional
[00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:51.120]   looking ePub all on your own.
[00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:54.960]   And even if you are hiring a couple of outside artists to do things that you want, it's still
[00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:58.640]   well within the limitations of a one-person publishing shop.
[00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:03.600]   But doesn't that work really well when you're talking about largely text information?
[00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:08.520]   The problem is that I still think that we're moving more and more towards interactive,
[00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:12.160]   much more visual components that are going to take some design, that are going to take
[00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:14.520]   some content creation, that are not going to be just the author.
[00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:17.640]   I mean, when we look at the future of all of the education stuff that we're working on
[00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:21.400]   here in Africa and with a bunch of school systems, is that we're not looking at anything
[00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:22.920]   that's just raw text.
[00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:25.080]   And everything has to be built from the ground up.
[00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:29.080]   And nothing is built on any of these things that can format it any which way, because
[00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:30.080]   that's fine.
[00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:33.800]   It's a great way to, it's a great storage, it's a great compression technology.
[00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:40.960]   But when you actually want to increase the speed at which people are acquiring that information,
[00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:43.560]   that mass market approach might not be the most effective.
[00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:48.280]   I'm not sure that anybody, this is going to sound glib, but I'm absolutely serious here.
[00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:53.080]   I'm not sure that anybody currently over the age of 20 has the ability to define that
[00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:54.080]   revolution.
[00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:57.520]   Because we've had the web now, now two generations of people.
[00:45:57.520 --> 00:45:59.320]   Exactly, that's what I'm feeling like.
[00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:00.320]   Yeah.
[00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:03.760]   And two generations of people who have been growing up with lots of experiments with the
[00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:08.120]   web, and we're still designing things that are basically here is, instead of this article
[00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:13.400]   being 300 pieces of paper, it's about 10 infinitely scrolling things that go down.
[00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:16.960]   And then there are things in the sidebars, but it's still a very traditional method of
[00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:18.800]   defining content and delivering it.
[00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:22.960]   I think that we're going to, nobody, nobody who is not in college right, someone who's
[00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:27.440]   not in college yet, who will figure out how to make it in such a way that it's not where
[00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:33.040]   that high level of interactivity doesn't feel like making a movie in 3D.
[00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:36.800]   Great UV technology, great, it's different, but it's not necessarily more effective than
[00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:38.840]   what people have been doing so far.
[00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:41.720]   Someone has really got to crack that and totally, totally redefine it.
[00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:43.160]   I don't think it's going to be anybody now.
[00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:44.800]   You know, Leo, you need to take that special.
[00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:45.800]   You did.
[00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:48.960]   Did you see that with my daughter and her friends, Brian Wong?
[00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:52.080]   And I think that that should be a regular show because I think we're going to do it because
[00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:54.280]   it's these people who are 21 and younger.
[00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:56.800]   My daughter is 15 and she can do a few incredible breakdowns.
[00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:57.800]   We'll do it.
[00:46:57.800 --> 00:47:00.560]   She'll look at the sites and she'll go, "Oh, this doesn't work here and I don't like the
[00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:01.560]   way this interacts."
[00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:05.800]   It's always been my thought that just like the printing press for the first few generations
[00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:09.520]   after Gutenberg, Event and Moveable type, they just did the same thing they always did.
[00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:11.000]   They made more Bibles.
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:15.200]   And it took a generation or two growing up with printed materials to say, "Oh, you know,
[00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:16.200]   we could do novels.
[00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:17.200]   We could do plays.
[00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:18.840]   We could do Luther's 100.
[00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:20.360]   How many Theses do they have?
[00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:21.360]   Theses?"
[00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:22.360]   And it changed the world.
[00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:26.040]   It created the Protestant Reformation and a whole lot more because it took a couple of
[00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:27.040]   generations.
[00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:28.040]   I think the Internet's going to be the same.
[00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:34.040]   It's only until the kids who grew up, as my daughter did, from birth on with the Internet,
[00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:37.480]   those are the ones who are going to define it, not us because I see it as radio.
[00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:39.920]   You see it as film.
[00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:41.000]   And you might see it as a newspaper.
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:45.560]   We see it through the lens, the prism of our consciousness.
[00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:46.800]   So I think we will do that.
[00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:47.800]   100 won.
[00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:49.400]   100 Theses and he nailed him Zudor, I know.
[00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:53.560]   But afterwards he printed him and distributed him to the world thanks to Gutenberg.
[00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:57.160]   So it's Gutenberg's fault, blame Gutenberg for that mosque.
[00:47:57.160 --> 00:47:58.320]   No, no, I'm sorry.
[00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:01.200]   I forget I said anything.
[00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:02.920]   We were so far away from him.
[00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:04.760]   People had completely forgotten about that.
[00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:06.640]   I'm watching too much MSNBC.
[00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:07.640]   I'm sorry.
[00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:09.720]   Why are you filled with self-loathing?
[00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:12.400]   Because the success that's coming to you Leo is earned.
[00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:13.760]   You don't need to sabotage yourself.
[00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:15.400]   I'm trying to burn it to the ground.
[00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:16.400]   Enjoy it, exactly.
[00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:17.720]   I don't want to be successful.
[00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:18.720]   I don't.
[00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:19.720]   I don't.
[00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:20.720]   So I'm doing another commercial.
[00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:21.720]   That'll chase him away.
[00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:22.720]   Let's talk about, no.
[00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:24.720]   See, see what I did there?
[00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:27.200]   See now the advertisers going, why'd you say that, Leo?
[00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:28.200]   Why?
[00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:29.200]   Why, Leo?
[00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:30.200]   What's wrong with you?
[00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:32.840]   I'm wearing a tech TV t-shirt.
[00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:33.840]   That's why.
[00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:34.840]   Yes, another.
[00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:36.440]   Proving that you're a survivor, Leo.
[00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:39.160]   No, no, another company I burnt to the ground, actually.
[00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:40.160]   Exactly.
[00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:41.160]   But you're--
[00:48:41.160 --> 00:48:42.160]   Who was your own Leo's for?
[00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:43.160]   You're the guy.
[00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:44.160]   You're the guy.
[00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:45.160]   You're the guy.
[00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:46.160]   How the cockroach that made it.
[00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:48.560]   Putting on the sunglasses, walking away from the fire in slow motion towards the camera.
[00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:50.280]   The shimmery hate movie.
[00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:51.280]   See, that's you.
[00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:57.360]   It's my favorite part of that movie, The Other Guys with Will Ferrell as the stupid
[00:48:57.360 --> 00:48:59.840]   cop where he gets blown up.
[00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:04.680]   He says, "Why in the movies do they always get run away from explosions and survive?
[00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:06.560]   That's very irresponsible."
[00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:07.560]   Okay.
[00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:10.160]   Can I mention going to my PC?
[00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:12.480]   These great folks at Citrix deserve better than me.
[00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:13.480]   I know.
[00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:14.960]   Going to my PC-- I've used this for years.
[00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:16.240]   We have it on a lot of our systems.
[00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:19.560]   It allows you to access your computer from anywhere.
[00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:22.240]   Now, for many of us, we don't work nine to five.
[00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:23.240]   We work around the clock.
[00:49:23.240 --> 00:49:24.240]   An idea comes to you.
[00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:25.560]   You have a little spare time.
[00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:29.080]   You want to finish a project or just clear that inbox before you have to come into work.
[00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:33.440]   The worst thing is to go on vacation and know you've got 20,000 emails waiting for you when
[00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:36.520]   you could log into going to my PC and delete half of them.
[00:49:36.520 --> 00:49:39.000]   Just because I know I don't need those.
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:40.640]   It's not like you're working 24/7.
[00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:42.800]   It's like you're working smarter.
[00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:46.200]   When you're on the road and you need that PowerPoint or keynote slide, boy, it sure
[00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:50.120]   is nice to be able to go to go to my PC.com, log in securely.
[00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:54.400]   Even in a sketchy internet cafe in Rwanda, you could log in-- not that there are any of
[00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:55.400]   those, Alex Lindsey.
[00:49:55.400 --> 00:49:57.560]   We know Rwanda is a fine, fine place.
[00:49:57.560 --> 00:49:59.400]   Not a lot of sketch there.
[00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:00.400]   No sketch.
[00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:01.400]   It's kind of surprising that I'm sketch.
[00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:02.400]   I'll say he's a cat man dude.
[00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:06.800]   I've been in-- I've been in-- I've used this in India.
[00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:08.280]   You probably use it all over the world.
[00:50:08.280 --> 00:50:09.280]   Yeah.
[00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:10.280]   It works great.
[00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:11.280]   It's amazing.
[00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:14.440]   By the way, now, a fully Mac compatible, they've actually designed a Mac client from
[00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:15.440]   the ground up.
[00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:19.520]   They know that Mac people, we demand a little bit more aesthetically.
[00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:21.440]   You could try it for 30 days free Mac or PC.
[00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:24.560]   In fact, it's kind of cool because you can run a Mac from a PC.
[00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:29.760]   It's the only way I know that you could run Mac applications on a PC is using GoToMyPC
[00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:31.640]   unless you hack and toss it, right?
[00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:33.720]   GoToMyPC.com/Macbreak.
[00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:37.520]   It'll give you a 30 day free trial, unlimited uses as much as you want, as often as you
[00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:40.640]   want, as long as you want for 30 days free.
[00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:42.880]   Go to myPC.com/Macbreak.
[00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:43.880]   We thank Citrix for their support.
[00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:50.720]   I have lunch with the Citrix guys on Friday in Los Angeles and they can spank me then.
[00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:57.000]   I think this is a great conversation about computing, about young, the young, and their
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:02.280]   take on it versus, and I'm really starting to feel like the guy who I remember Ziploc
[00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:03.440]   bagged software.
[00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:09.360]   I remember user group meetings and it really, that world is slowly going away.
[00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:14.320]   When I see a TV show like Big Bang Theory, which I know you love, and it's celebrating
[00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:22.400]   geeks, I almost feel like it's an anachronism because those geeks, the AV squad geeks, they
[00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:23.720]   don't exist anymore.
[00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:25.480]   That's an old notion.
[00:51:25.480 --> 00:51:28.720]   They become the make generation.
[00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:30.160]   That's exactly right.
[00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:31.160]   It's cool.
[00:51:31.160 --> 00:51:32.800]   It's Adam Savage.
[00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:33.800]   It's cool.
[00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:38.360]   What I think is interesting is that it's never been easier just to be a content recipient,
[00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:41.600]   to just kind of surf through things, but it's also never been easier to do it yourself
[00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:43.440]   because there's so much information.
[00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:45.800]   There's so many guides and easy.
[00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:47.360]   Can we promote that?
[00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:49.720]   Can we say, look, it's great to have an iPad.
[00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:50.920]   It's a wonderful world.
[00:51:50.920 --> 00:51:52.680]   You can watch TV Hulu Plus.
[00:51:52.680 --> 00:51:54.280]   You can watch now.
[00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:56.000]   This is really a personal TV.
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:00.440]   You could go and veg out, but let's also encourage creation.
[00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:04.240]   If we all create, then there's so much more better stuff in there.
[00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:05.840]   A lot more fun.
[00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:09.600]   Well, that will always be one of the greatest levers of technology.
[00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:14.840]   The ability for anybody to simply put work out there and to grow and find its own audience.
[00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:18.720]   If there's one big benefit that I don't think anybody can really argue against, it's
[00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:24.760]   going to be that ability to simply fail on your own terms and not fail because you couldn't
[00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:30.240]   convince an agent to represent your manuscript or a publisher than to listen to your agent
[00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:32.960]   and then move forward for their failing on your own terms.
[00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:34.480]   Can't speak enough of it.
[00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:35.480]   I've done a lot of that.
[00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:36.480]   Yeah, couldn't agree more.
[00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:38.000]   You failed on your own terms.
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:42.920]   But rather than failing on somebody else's terms, I guess, but still not as good as succeeding
[00:52:42.920 --> 00:52:45.240]   because you caved into commercial interests.
[00:52:45.240 --> 00:52:46.240]   Yeah.
[00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:53.200]   You'd rather succeed on your own terms, but if I could succeed or fail, succeed because
[00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:57.800]   someone said, "Here's an idea that's totally commercial, but you'll make a million bucks."
[00:52:57.800 --> 00:53:02.520]   I'd probably say, "See, you're like me."
[00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:05.920]   We eschew phony success.
[00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:09.000]   We celebrate and embrace success on our own terms.
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:10.000]   Why, I guess, most stable.
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:11.000]   How ever meager.
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:12.000]   Funny times.
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:14.520]   However meager and sad our lives may be as a result.
[00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:15.520]   Hey, you know what?
[00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:17.760]   I am buying name-brand cola beverages.
[00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:18.760]   Wow.
[00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:20.760]   That's what I'm doing.
[00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:22.840]   The store brand I stopped buying two years ago.
[00:53:22.840 --> 00:53:23.840]   Okay.
[00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:24.840]   Thank you, readers.
[00:53:24.840 --> 00:53:26.520]   Poster boy.
[00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:29.640]   For making it on my own terms, Mr. Andy and I go.
[00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:31.280]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:32.280]   Okay.
[00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:34.480]   Moving right along.
[00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:37.040]   I'm sure there's some other stories that I'm missing.
[00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:39.960]   Did you see that this is actually not really a max story, but very funny.
[00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:42.480]   Will Wheaton is part of the Woodstock?
[00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:44.360]   You know about Woodstock, right, guys?
[00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:50.920]   And you saw the fake Elise who quit her job.
[00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:52.600]   Will quits Woodstock with a whiteboard?
[00:53:52.600 --> 00:53:53.680]   Happy Monday, everybody.
[00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:54.680]   I'm quitting Woodstock.
[00:53:54.680 --> 00:53:55.680]   Wait a minute.
[00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:58.240]   Don't go all run around saying he's quitting.
[00:53:58.240 --> 00:54:01.320]   No, I've learned a lot over the past year and I'm going to miss everyone.
[00:54:01.320 --> 00:54:04.040]   Except for you, Storm of Paul and Storm.
[00:54:04.040 --> 00:54:05.040]   Wait, guys.
[00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:06.040]   Hold on a second.
[00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:07.040]   Photobooth.
[00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:08.040]   That's neat effects.
[00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:09.040]   Bonjour from Paris, beach's.
[00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:10.040]   I'm flying.
[00:54:10.040 --> 00:54:11.800]   I'm on a boat.
[00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:13.960]   Shut up, Wesley.
[00:54:13.960 --> 00:54:15.560]   I love this one.
[00:54:15.560 --> 00:54:18.760]   That's Will Wheaton saying shut up, Wesley.
[00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:25.000]   Anyway, he's saying working with Storm has been like living in.
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:26.920]   This must be some Star Wars reference.
[00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:28.400]   A Sarlacc pit.
[00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:34.920]   Yes, that would be the pit in "Recurred Legitii," to which Boba Fett fell at either died or
[00:54:34.920 --> 00:54:37.080]   did not die or escaped depending on your...
[00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:39.080]   Was eaten by the giant worm.
[00:54:39.080 --> 00:54:42.080]   It depends on whether you believe the novels are canon or non-canon.
[00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:47.080]   And how come you're not at Celebration 5 after all?
[00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:49.000]   Oh, because...
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:50.000]   Oh, because...
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:51.000]   Oh, because...
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:54.440]   Because my Jaren's sin costumed didn't come back for the day.
[00:54:54.440 --> 00:54:55.920]   I know that feeling, boy.
[00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:59.320]   You have violated Wheaton's law consistently and it's only gotten worse over time.
[00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:01.520]   Look, I made a graph.
[00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:05.280]   Storm's dickishness over time.
[00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:06.280]   See?
[00:55:06.280 --> 00:55:07.840]   That's science, man.
[00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:10.520]   Plus you spilled beer on my munchkin cards.
[00:55:10.520 --> 00:55:11.680]   Wait a minute.
[00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:14.480]   When Storm gets in there...
[00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:15.480]   It's actually very funny.
[00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:17.480]   If you want to see it, it's at the Woodstock site.
[00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:18.480]   Woodstock has come...
[00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:19.920]   I'm going to give him a free plug just for that.
[00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:23.480]   September 16th and 17th, the Great American Music Hall in San Francisco.
[00:55:23.480 --> 00:55:25.280]   Paul and Storm will Wheaton, Adam Savage.
[00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:28.240]   In fact, Adam comes in at the end of that.
[00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:29.960]   I should just mention from Mythbusters.
[00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:33.040]   Let me go down there's Paul, there's Storm.
[00:55:33.040 --> 00:55:34.040]   The fighting goes on.
[00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:37.880]   This is like the longest whiteboard dialogue in Adam Savage at the end.
[00:55:37.880 --> 00:55:40.320]   You're all fired.
[00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:42.120]   Very cute.
[00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:43.840]   But that's not news, is it?
[00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:46.840]   Close.
[00:55:46.840 --> 00:55:48.680]   Dilbert made fun of Steve Jobs today.
[00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:49.680]   Did he really?
[00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:50.680]   What do you say?
[00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:54.560]   It's the pointy-haired boss that announces that...
[00:55:54.560 --> 00:55:56.160]   I've decided that I'm going to walk...
[00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:57.160]   I'm going to...
[00:55:57.160 --> 00:55:58.560]   Hang on, I like to get a guy right here.
[00:55:58.560 --> 00:56:02.800]   I've decided that I'm going to walk around wearing a black turtleneck sweater and old
[00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:03.800]   man jeans from now on.
[00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:04.800]   How do I look?
[00:56:04.800 --> 00:56:07.880]   The secretary says, "You look like..."
[00:56:07.880 --> 00:56:09.920]   I'm sure this is a euphemism.
[00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:11.920]   You look like a juice bag.
[00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:14.720]   And said, "What do you mean by that?"
[00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:18.080]   She says, "What answer will get me back to watching Hulu on my PC faster?"
[00:56:18.080 --> 00:56:20.080]   Oh, see, Dilbert, he is geeky.
[00:56:20.080 --> 00:56:22.000]   Also, I mentioned Big Bang Theory.
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:24.240]   Woz is going to make a guest appearance on that.
[00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:25.240]   Isn't he, Andy?
[00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:26.240]   I think he is.
[00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:27.240]   Yep.
[00:56:27.240 --> 00:56:28.240]   They announced that Comic Con a couple of weeks ago.
[00:56:28.240 --> 00:56:29.240]   That's pretty exciting.
[00:56:29.240 --> 00:56:33.920]   Also announced at Celebration 5, Star Wars Blu-ray.
[00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:34.920]   All six movies.
[00:56:34.920 --> 00:56:35.920]   I can't wait.
[00:56:35.920 --> 00:56:38.240]   Okay, but not the original versions.
[00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:39.240]   The canon versions.
[00:56:39.240 --> 00:56:40.240]   Yeah.
[00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:41.240]   Right, exactly.
[00:56:41.240 --> 00:56:42.240]   The edits.
[00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:44.680]   Although, I did get pretty excited.
[00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:46.480]   They have some unseen footage.
[00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:50.000]   And at this point, if there's any footage anywhere related to that movie that I've not
[00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:52.840]   seen before, I'm going to play that 13 times in a row.
[00:56:52.840 --> 00:56:56.080]   So there's a cut scene from the turn that I...
[00:56:56.080 --> 00:56:57.080]   The lights in the mirror.
[00:56:57.080 --> 00:57:00.720]   Right, where Luke is now a Jedi, and he officially finishes building his lightsaber, which is
[00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:04.560]   the last thing you need to do to officially get your Jedi patch or whatever.
[00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:07.440]   He's got his badge now.
[00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:09.320]   He's got the whole banner is full now.
[00:57:09.320 --> 00:57:11.880]   I want to say something though.
[00:57:11.880 --> 00:57:13.720]   My fellow geeks who attend conventions.
[00:57:13.720 --> 00:57:18.400]   Now, the video that I saw was of course shot from the crowd at the screen when he was being
[00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:20.160]   shown during the convention.
[00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:26.160]   Realize that there were all kinds of flashes going on during that presentation.
[00:57:26.160 --> 00:57:31.600]   And if there's any group of people, Star Wars geeks should know that the flash is not going
[00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:32.600]   to help you at all.
[00:57:32.600 --> 00:57:35.920]   You should put the camera off of automatic and put it onto manual.
[00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:38.080]   I hate it when they do that.
[00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:40.040]   Ruining everything for everyone you big jerky jerky.
[00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:41.040]   I just know.
[00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:42.040]   I can...
[00:57:42.040 --> 00:57:43.560]   If one of my parents did that, okay.
[00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:45.200]   If one of my aunts did that, that's okay.
[00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:46.200]   You know this.
[00:57:46.200 --> 00:57:49.280]   My cousin who's a potter, I can understand that.
[00:57:49.280 --> 00:57:51.240]   But we're Star Wars geeks.
[00:57:51.240 --> 00:57:54.240]   We understand how digital cameras work.
[00:57:54.240 --> 00:57:59.120]   We understand how light bounces from here to there, back onto a neighbor's sensor and
[00:57:59.120 --> 00:58:00.280]   produces an image.
[00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:01.440]   We should be better than that.
[00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:02.440]   That's all I'm saying.
[00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:03.440]   I'm appealing to your heart.
[00:58:03.440 --> 00:58:04.440]   It's not even digital.
[00:58:04.440 --> 00:58:06.400]   I'm a Neil Diamond concert 20 years ago.
[00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:07.880]   People are flashes like crazy.
[00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:11.480]   All you're going to get is a well-lit back of the person's head in front of you.
[00:58:11.480 --> 00:58:12.480]   But it's well lit.
[00:58:12.480 --> 00:58:13.480]   It's a little overexposed.
[00:58:13.480 --> 00:58:18.600]   See, that was even worse because that's when people had to actually pop in a flash bulb
[00:58:18.600 --> 00:58:19.600]   or something.
[00:58:19.600 --> 00:58:20.600]   Right.
[00:58:20.600 --> 00:58:21.600]   It was.
[00:58:21.600 --> 00:58:22.600]   It was that long ago.
[00:58:22.600 --> 00:58:23.600]   Oh, I ate it.
[00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:24.600]   At least the current generation can play.
[00:58:24.600 --> 00:58:25.600]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:26.600]   I forgot it was an automatic.
[00:58:26.600 --> 00:58:27.600]   And of course the automatic feature turned on the flash.
[00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:28.600]   I'm so sorry.
[00:58:28.600 --> 00:58:29.960]   I'll turn that back off again.
[00:58:29.960 --> 00:58:30.960]   You paid...
[00:58:30.960 --> 00:58:34.360]   So a guy paid 89 cents to take a flash photo of the back of someone's head.
[00:58:34.360 --> 00:58:39.960]   When is this knowledge going to permeate into our culture that a flash at a large event?
[00:58:39.960 --> 00:58:43.440]   Well, if you're more than 10 feet away, don't use the flash basically.
[00:58:43.440 --> 00:58:44.440]   Right.
[00:58:44.440 --> 00:58:45.440]   Yes.
[00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:46.440]   I don't know.
[00:58:46.440 --> 00:58:48.520]   I'm a big fan of if you're even within 10 feet, don't use the flash.
[00:58:48.520 --> 00:58:50.000]   Well, I don't like the flash at all.
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:51.000]   Yeah.
[00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:53.000]   But not everyone has a F1.2.
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:55.520]   Then you lens my friend.
[00:58:55.520 --> 00:58:56.520]   Be the other.
[00:58:56.520 --> 00:58:57.520]   Everybody?
[00:58:57.520 --> 00:58:58.520]   Then you should.
[00:58:58.520 --> 00:58:59.520]   He says.
[00:58:59.520 --> 00:59:00.520]   That's his answer.
[00:59:00.520 --> 00:59:01.680]   Why not?
[00:59:01.680 --> 00:59:05.120]   Apple Papermaster Leaves, Apple Takes the Fall for Intenigate.
[00:59:05.120 --> 00:59:07.600]   You probably covered that last week.
[00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:14.040]   Did you cover the low level, mid level, Apple employee who was busted for...
[00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:15.040]   Kickbacks.
[00:59:15.040 --> 00:59:16.240]   Kickbacks, taking kickbacks from suppliers.
[00:59:16.240 --> 00:59:17.440]   I think you know him.
[00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:18.440]   I might have met him.
[00:59:18.440 --> 00:59:19.440]   I actually might have met him.
[00:59:19.440 --> 00:59:20.440]   On an airplane.
[00:59:20.440 --> 00:59:22.120]   Yeah, we were talking about stuff.
[00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:27.120]   I asked Lisa Bettany if she would care to comment on the camera plus fiasco.
[00:59:27.120 --> 00:59:28.120]   What happened?
[00:59:28.120 --> 00:59:29.120]   She wouldn't comment.
[00:59:29.120 --> 00:59:31.040]   All I can say is they already made a lot of money.
[00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:33.120]   Okay, well, here's what happened.
[00:59:33.120 --> 00:59:36.960]   They had a feature in one of the early betas in which...
[00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:39.640]   I mean, it doesn't now.
[00:59:39.640 --> 00:59:40.640]   I tried the URL.
[00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:41.640]   There's a...
[00:59:41.640 --> 00:59:45.240]   I know I can't put my phone to make sure I would be distracted.
[00:59:45.240 --> 00:59:50.280]   But so it repurposes one of the volume buttons to take the place of the shutter buttons.
[00:59:50.280 --> 00:59:53.920]   You can hold it like a regular camera and just click the shutter like that.
[00:59:53.920 --> 00:59:59.200]   It got refused initially by the Apple because you're not supposed to...
[00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:01.800]   The volume button is supposed to be a volume button that's not supposed to do anything
[01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:02.800]   else.
[01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:05.320]   Even if you're using a camera that doesn't have any reason to use the volume.
[01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:06.320]   Exactly.
[01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:07.880]   Now, here's where it gets really interesting.
[01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:11.880]   Now I think there's sort of unfortunate behavior on both sides.
[01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:16.560]   So the camera plus folks said, "Okay, we are going to resubmit it without that feature
[01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:20.880]   and without really telling it without telling Apple, they actually included it as an Easter
[01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:21.880]   egg."
[01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:22.880]   So the feature is still in there.
[01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:26.800]   What you have to do is you have to plug in a special URL into Safari that sort of sends
[01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:28.200]   a command to camera plus.
[01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:33.640]   "Oh, by the way, activate your super secret camera button shutter feature."
[01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:34.640]   And Apple's...
[01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:38.840]   When they found out about that, pulled the app again saying, "We thought we were clear
[01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:39.840]   before.
[01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:42.480]   We didn't say make it a super top secret feature that we wouldn't find out about.
[01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:45.120]   We said remove that feature and now we're removing your software."
[01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:48.800]   Well, what we don't know, and this is why I called Lisa, is who removed it.
[01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:49.960]   Do we know that Apple removed it?
[01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:50.960]   It could be...
[01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:52.120]   Tap, tap, tap.
[01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:53.480]   These guys are brilliant marketing guys.
[01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:56.200]   It could very well be that tap, tap, said, "Oh, we'll pull it out."
[01:00:56.200 --> 01:01:00.160]   And by the way, Andy apparently enabled it.
[01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:07.880]   So the way you do it is you go to Safari on your iPhone and you type in...
[01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:08.880]   What is it?
[01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:15.600]   "Camera plus colon slash slash," which is a URL you probably never see.
[01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:19.840]   That's a really cool piece of functionality in the operating system where the...
[01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:24.320]   A URL that is activated through Safari can actually send information to another application.
[01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:25.320]   Right.
[01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:26.320]   So it's been around for a while.
[01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:30.400]   You could type "pcast colon slash slash" on your Mac and launch iTunes.
[01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:34.400]   So it knows how to hand stuff off to other apps.
[01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:38.840]   I just don't know who to back with this in that.
[01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:40.560]   Well, they clearly violated this.
[01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:43.800]   It's going to go back to the conversation that I had at the beginning, which is you live
[01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:49.560]   in the Apple universe, you get a lot of benefits, you got to go with Apple's design.
[01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:51.480]   This is your Dell developer agreement.
[01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:55.280]   Apple's design principles say, "Thou shalt not modify the hardware buttons to do something
[01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:58.680]   unpredictable because we want users to know when you turn and volume up and down."
[01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:00.880]   It turns volume up and down, not takes a picture.
[01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:03.040]   I think that's reasonable to insist on.
[01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:04.640]   Then they violated it.
[01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:08.440]   Well, to me the big deal is that there was told specifically, here's why we refused...
[01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:12.000]   Or excuse me, if I understand the story correctly, that they were told specifically not to put
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.400]   that feature in and they decided to sneak it in.
[01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:15.720]   So that makes it okay.
[01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:17.000]   I don't know how hard...
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:20.200]   How put upon you can feel if Apple does something you don't like.
[01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:25.840]   But the important counter argument is that Apple has a good point to make that they want
[01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:28.720]   to make sure that people are not writing applications so that the volume button does
[01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:31.200]   something that the user doesn't expect it to do.
[01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:35.240]   But the way that this feature is activated, you have to know this URL.
[01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:37.360]   You have to choose to activate it.
[01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:41.800]   So you know for a fact at this point, this isn't accidental, you know that this point
[01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:46.440]   that after having done that multiple step process, this volume button and this application
[01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:48.120]   will now double as a shutter button.
[01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:49.920]   So I think that Apple really...
[01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:53.240]   If Apple were a different company, I would be saying, "Oh, they should give them a mulligan
[01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:54.240]   on this one."
[01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:55.640]   It's okay for...
[01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:58.440]   I feel as though it's okay to curate the experience.
[01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:05.160]   But as with the Android platform, the best solution is to put an option someplace, very
[01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:09.440]   deep, deep inside settings that says, "Give me the ability to screw up my phone if I want
[01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:10.440]   to screw up my phone."
[01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:12.200]   I'll tell you why they don't do it.
[01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:16.080]   Because there were those flashlight apps that you can enable with an Easter egg, you can
[01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:17.080]   enable tethering.
[01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:18.080]   Yeah.
[01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:19.080]   And if you...
[01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:22.880]   It's a slippery slope because you have to make the argument, "Oh, well, this one's okay
[01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:24.760]   because people did it on purpose."
[01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:31.560]   By the way, the URL and here it is on screen is CAM plus C-A-M-P-L-U-S colon slash slash
[01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:34.000]   enable volume snap, all one word.
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:35.000]   And there's...
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.080]   By the way, disable volume snap also works.
[01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:38.080]   So you can turn it off.
[01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:40.680]   This is Daniel Dilger's uneasy silence blog.
[01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:43.920]   No, I got to say, don't you wish you had bought that application.
[01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:45.920]   I did, and I have it, and it works.
[01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:48.040]   So if you ever hear about two of the things happening with you...
[01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:50.040]   These applications, you have to go get it.
[01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:51.040]   The whole sale...
[01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:55.280]   So they tweeted it, tap, tap, tap, tweeted it, pulled the tweet, but of course once stuff's
[01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:57.200]   tweeted, it's out there in the real world.
[01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:58.360]   And I cannot blame Apple.
[01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:00.000]   I cannot fault Apple at this point.
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.000]   No, I can't.
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:07.040]   I mean, also, there's a reason why a secret is called a secret because it's a secret.
[01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:09.440]   If it's not a secret, then it stops being a secret.
[01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:13.240]   It sounds like a tautology, but it actually is not.
[01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:14.240]   And if you...
[01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:17.360]   Look, if you want a shutter button, you can go to another phone.
[01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:21.240]   And that's kind of what Jobs has said over and over again in those emails is, look, this
[01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:22.240]   is how we do it.
[01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:23.680]   So you don't like it, go somewhere else.
[01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:25.720]   Now that's by the way why I use an Android phone.
[01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:27.360]   I went somewhere else.
[01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:29.880]   I happen to have a camera button on my Android phone.
[01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:31.040]   I like it.
[01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:32.040]   It doesn't work.
[01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:36.360]   But hey, at least it takes an hour to do anything, but it happens.
[01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:37.360]   No, it works.
[01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:38.360]   It works pretty well.
[01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:39.360]   It's funny.
[01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:44.000]   It's not an ideal way to use the phone, but it does work.
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:45.240]   Look, I'll show you.
[01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:46.240]   See?
[01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:50.880]   One, two, three, four.
[01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:55.520]   You press it again, then it says, "Okay, I have a couple of camera applications on here."
[01:04:55.520 --> 01:04:57.400]   Which this is the difference, right?
[01:04:57.400 --> 01:04:59.400]   This is the Android experience.
[01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:02.520]   Okay, yeah, you wanted to use a camera, no problem, but would you like to use a camera
[01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:04.040]   or this other application?
[01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:07.200]   Now I could say from now on, but maybe I want to leave that open.
[01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:08.200]   All right, all right.
[01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:09.680]   Now from now on, I want to use that application.
[01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:12.480]   This is called choice.
[01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:15.720]   And now your child has decided to just jump off the diving board with that.
[01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:17.720]   Long ago, by the way.
[01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:21.000]   Long ago, and now I press the button one, two, there it goes.
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.200]   That wasn't so bad.
[01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:24.200]   Let me take one.
[01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:25.840]   Cheryl, it's your Uncle Leo.
[01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:28.400]   I'd like to have your seventh birthday party again.
[01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:29.400]   One more time, Cheryl.
[01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:30.400]   I took the picture.
[01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:31.400]   It wasn't so bad.
[01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:32.400]   There you go.
[01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:33.400]   It wasn't too long.
[01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:37.040]   And we'll listeners be able to put a watch when they're watching this tomorrow.
[01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:39.880]   Just put a stopwatch over to the time when he pushed that button.
[01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:41.360]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:44.800]   But from now on, I think, because I chose an application, let's see.
[01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:46.840]   OK, now I'm back in the home page.
[01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:53.880]   Press the button one, two, three, OK, three, OK, screw you.
[01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:56.240]   Press it again.
[01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:58.640]   That was intense.
[01:05:58.640 --> 01:05:59.640]   Nine.
[01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:01.560]   Ten seconds.
[01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:04.120]   Not bad.
[01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:06.280]   In my defense, the iPhone is not exactly instant either.
[01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:08.560]   It's not ten seconds, but it's not exactly instant.
[01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:09.560]   Go ahead.
[01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:10.560]   Let's see.
[01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:11.560]   Go ahead.
[01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:14.480]   Press is the camera button.
[01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:15.920]   Now it's ready.
[01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:16.920]   So three, four seconds.
[01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:19.400]   So look, if you take it out, look at a real camera.
[01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:24.920]   If you really want to take pictures, to me, the fair test is I have a camera button that
[01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:28.080]   is designed to take a picture when I press the camera button.
[01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:30.880]   Here is the camera button on the iPhone.
[01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:31.880]   Ready?
[01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:32.880]   One thousand one.
[01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:33.880]   Oh, it took the picture.
[01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:34.880]   I pressed the camera button.
[01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:35.880]   It was launched one month.
[01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:36.880]   It was launched one month.
[01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:42.120]   The issue is, and I never liked this, it's a soft button on the screen.
[01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:45.160]   So if you're pointing, you have to remember where it was if you want to take a picture
[01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:46.160]   of yourself.
[01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:48.400]   It's nice to have a physical button.
[01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:51.720]   I understand why camera plus tried to enable a physical button.
[01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:54.320]   I understand why Apple said no, no.
[01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:55.320]   That's a foul.
[01:06:55.320 --> 01:06:56.680]   They pulled him from the store.
[01:06:56.680 --> 01:07:00.960]   They've made a half a million dollars, and to Apple's credit, that's Apple saying, okay,
[01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:04.600]   we're not going to make any more money because they made hundreds, it's $130,000 or whatever
[01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:05.600]   on the thing.
[01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:06.600]   I think there's like 250,000.
[01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:07.600]   Yeah.
[01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:08.600]   They did okay.
[01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:11.400]   They did okay when we're talking about half a million in the first month was the final
[01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:12.400]   amount.
[01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:13.400]   Oh, really?
[01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:15.040]   Half a million dollars in sales, I guess.
[01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:16.240]   I hope Lisa got a big check.
[01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:17.240]   She says she did.
[01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:18.240]   I talked to her.
[01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:19.240]   She's happy.
[01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:21.880]   She didn't say how much, but she said she's very happy her lifestyle has changed.
[01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:22.880]   So I like that.
[01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:25.000]   Now, remember, she was living on nothing for a while.
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.440]   So I just, well done.
[01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:31.200]   I just have to say, this is the way it is.
[01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:32.600]   We can bitch about I ads.
[01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:35.160]   We can bitch about, you know, app store.
[01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:36.320]   We can bitch about that stuff.
[01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:37.320]   And I certainly do.
[01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:39.120]   And the reality is it's not like they lost money on it.
[01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:40.120]   I mean, they did.
[01:07:40.120 --> 01:07:41.120]   They did okay.
[01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:42.120]   Cut off.
[01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:43.120]   They'll do something.
[01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:44.120]   Now that's something we can do something about.
[01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:51.760]   And AT&T has now warned in a 10Q filing with the SEC that exclusivity of certain popular
[01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:53.320]   handsets is limited.
[01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:57.520]   And now there's more because the Wall Street Journal now is again reporting that they hear
[01:07:57.520 --> 01:07:59.760]   that Verizon will have the iPhone in January.
[01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:03.240]   I would say that at this point, we could pretty much say this is for sure.
[01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:07.640]   Of course, I just got a new, that's why AT&T gave us the $18 upgrade so that we would
[01:08:07.640 --> 01:08:11.080]   get our our phone quickly before anyone realizes that they could get a new phone.
[01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:12.080]   Somewhere else.
[01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:13.080]   I think it's interesting.
[01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:14.080]   All right.
[01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:16.080]   We're going to do our that's it.
[01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:18.080]   That was the flash round.
[01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:22.240]   Oh, speaking of flash, you mentioned that the FTC is investigating Apple's flash.
[01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:23.240]   We did.
[01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:24.240]   Yeah.
[01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:25.240]   Okay.
[01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:26.240]   And we agreed that nothing will probably happen.
[01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:27.240]   Nothing will happen.
[01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:33.640]   By the way, the camera on the iPhone is better than the camera on almost any other phone
[01:08:33.640 --> 01:08:35.000]   I've ever had any phone I've ever used.
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:39.080]   I can't think of a phone where it's anywhere close to even though it's only five megapixels.
[01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:42.760]   It's still the colors are truer.
[01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:43.760]   It's crisp.
[01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:44.760]   It looks great.
[01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:46.560]   It really is a great camera on the iPhone.
[01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:49.080]   So there you happy now?
[01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:51.600]   Do you do the MMS feature?
[01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:52.600]   I have very much.
[01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:53.600]   I haven't made you cry yet.
[01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:55.760]   So I really want to see you cry.
[01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:58.840]   Oh, you you made me cry.
[01:08:58.840 --> 01:08:59.840]   You've made me cry.
[01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:04.840]   I'm talking I'm talking about other than my performance on this show.
[01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:05.840]   This is kind of it.
[01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:11.880]   Well, it's always home with the old friends on Tuesday afternoon.
[01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:16.240]   According to the record, this isn't really a Mac store, but it is going to affect the
[01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:22.240]   iPhone, I guess, maybe music labels and radio broadcasters agree.
[01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:23.640]   Oh, this is stupid.
[01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:24.640]   Oh my God.
[01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:28.120]   When you hear that, all you have to do is you just hear that first thing.
[01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:29.120]   Yeah.
[01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:32.680]   And you're like the dinosaurs, the dinosaurs have all gotten together by the carpet and
[01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:34.760]   they said that everyone must jump in.
[01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:41.280]   And they say that all the Congress should mandate that all phones, PDAs and other portable
[01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:44.680]   electronics must have an FM radio.
[01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:45.680]   Right.
[01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:46.680]   Mm.
[01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:47.680]   Yeah.
[01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:53.240]   The consumer electronics association response, the backroom scheme of the National Association
[01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:57.720]   of Broadcasters and the Recording Industry Association of America to have Congress mandate
[01:09:57.720 --> 01:10:03.560]   broadcast radios and portable devices, including mobile phones is the height of absurdity.
[01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:05.080]   Gary Shapiro, I love Gary.
[01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:08.400]   He says, such a move is not in our national interest.
[01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:13.160]   You might as well put a mosque at, never mind, rather than adapt to the digital marketplace,
[01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:19.320]   NAB and RIA act like buggy whip industries that refuse to innovate and seek to impose
[01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:22.280]   penalties on those that do end quote.
[01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:23.280]   That's a good quote.
[01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:24.280]   You know what I would have said.
[01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:25.280]   What?
[01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:26.280]   Really?
[01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:27.280]   Really?
[01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:28.280]   Really?
[01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:29.280]   Did they say that?
[01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:30.280]   And FM radio really?
[01:10:30.280 --> 01:10:31.280]   Really?
[01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:32.280]   Really?
[01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:33.280]   Really?
[01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:34.280]   Really?
[01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:35.760]   I just, I just can't believe that they would say that.
[01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:38.680]   I just, it's so, it doesn't even make sense.
[01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:42.080]   It's like so insane that I just went, that really come out of the mouth because I don't,
[01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:46.160]   I think we should take the benefit of the doubt and say that that was just a rumor because
[01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:47.960]   otherwise they're completed it's.
[01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:53.680]   I think, I think the RIA should like pay the onion a hundred thousand dollars to please
[01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:55.560]   write an article with that as the headlines.
[01:10:55.560 --> 01:11:00.720]   They can claim that all these stupid like link bait sites, we never said that.
[01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:02.720]   It's always just an onion.
[01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:03.720]   Onion.
[01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:04.720]   We put it in, we wouldn't laugh.
[01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:05.720]   It was the onion.
[01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:06.720]   It was the onion.
[01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:07.720]   Oh wait, wait, wait.
[01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:08.720]   We are laughing.
[01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:10.720]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:11.880]   Our picks of the week coming up.
[01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:13.120]   You could say one more thing Andy.
[01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:14.120]   No, no, no.
[01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:19.400]   And just, I was going to say there was a Mr. Show sketch from years ago where some movie
[01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:20.680]   studio made a movie that flopped.
[01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:26.160]   They decided to sue every like movie goer in America and won an injunction that basically
[01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:30.440]   so that the judge sentenced all of America to see the movie once.
[01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:31.960]   That's exactly what it's like.
[01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:32.960]   You can't make comedy.
[01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:34.960]   You can't make comedy years and stuff.
[01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:35.960]   All right.
[01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:38.400]   You can't make this stuff up.
[01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:44.960]   Oh, radio would agree to pay around a hundred million dollars a year for this.
[01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:47.680]   We'll give you ten dollars.
[01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:50.560]   How many hand sets are sold a year?
[01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:51.880]   It's got to be well over a hundred million.
[01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:52.880]   So the same.
[01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:55.280]   We'll give you a buck for every single handset.
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:57.280]   If you just put a radio in it.
[01:11:57.280 --> 01:11:58.280]   Right.
[01:11:58.280 --> 01:12:02.720]   Let me think about that.
[01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:05.840]   No, no.
[01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:08.960]   Although I will say that the only reason I kept my zoom for the while longer was because
[01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:11.000]   I had FM when I'll go to the gym.
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.600]   And but then I decided to listen to the TVs.
[01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:14.600]   Yeah.
[01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:15.600]   Listen to the TVs.
[01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:16.600]   That's the one you can't do that either anymore.
[01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:17.600]   Thanks to the FCC.
[01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:18.600]   You can listen to the TVs.
[01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:20.400]   No, they're not on the FM band anymore.
[01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:21.400]   Okay.
[01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:22.400]   24 hour fitness over here.
[01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:23.400]   There are.
[01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:24.400]   Yeah.
[01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:26.480]   They have a little broadcaster transmitter.
[01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:29.840]   You know, that's not used to be you could listen to like a couple of channels.
[01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:32.080]   Well, that's because the digital changer work.
[01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:33.080]   Right.
[01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:34.600]   Because the digital, yeah, there's no longer there.
[01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:37.440]   Well, actually the digital changer work well for me.
[01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:41.960]   It's but I just reprogram my TV again like yesterday and I'm down to ABC.
[01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:42.960]   Yeah.
[01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:46.480]   The all religious network and that that channel that does nothing but show like the A team
[01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:47.480]   and Knight Rider.
[01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:50.480]   This is a this is a I'm so happy with a switch over to digital.
[01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:51.480]   It's been so good.
[01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:52.480]   I used to get 11.
[01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:56.480]   Is this on the cable or is this broadcast?
[01:12:56.480 --> 01:13:00.360]   No, no, no, it's just I've the I only have I only have cable in like two different rooms
[01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:04.560]   of the house and I don't want to like have it run into like the kitchen slash sandal
[01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:10.800]   shared area and used to be that I would get like 18 like 11, 12, 13 channels over broadcast,
[01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:14.080]   including half of them which are a little bit fuzzy but perfectly watchable.
[01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:15.600]   And now you're in the cliff.
[01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:16.600]   You're in a cliff area.
[01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:19.160]   That's why I know I'm just not cliff area for God's sake.
[01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:23.240]   I was getting lots and lots of channels and I know as I'm now and now it's just a stupid
[01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:27.720]   finicky thing of oh, well, I'm going to give you a certain snippet of it but we feel as
[01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:31.720]   though the signal quality is below the required standards.
[01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:34.800]   We're not going to let you watch dancing with the stars tonight.
[01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:41.080]   The real thing that pisses me off is that Comcast used this as an excuse.
[01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:42.080]   Right.
[01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:45.280]   To say, oh, well, now we're going to make you have a digital cable box because digital's
[01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:46.280]   here.
[01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:50.400]   And somehow the broadcast digital mandate had anything to do with cable.
[01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:51.560]   So now I used I did.
[01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:57.640]   I used to got a bunch of stations in the clear on analog on my cable and they're all gone
[01:13:57.640 --> 01:14:00.600]   now like is crappy stations even though I'm watching cable.
[01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:04.160]   And what's fascinating is is that you know why all that bandwidth got opened up when
[01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:08.040]   they moved the digital because the digital signal is so much more compressed.
[01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:09.040]   Right.
[01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:13.080]   Like if you actually the old analog if you if you can pick up NHD channel in the old analog
[01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:17.120]   you would rabbit ears or whatever, it was unbelievably clear.
[01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:19.680]   You know, it's like I think it's pretty good though, isn't it?
[01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:26.000]   No, I have a I have a screenshot from the first time I used the ITVHD which is of the
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:31.680]   letter David Letterman facing his audience and you could recognize every face in the
[01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:32.680]   audience.
[01:14:32.680 --> 01:14:34.600]   There was so much detail and so uncompressed.
[01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:37.840]   So yeah, it's like when we when we were at when we were on lab with Leo, you look at the
[01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:40.080]   monitors there and you're like everybody would watch.
[01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:41.080]   Yeah.
[01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:42.520]   HD if they saw what we saw in the studio.
[01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:44.520]   And that's what you that's what you see on the analog signal.
[01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:45.520]   Right.
[01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:48.840]   But once you get the once you get digitized, you get on macro blocking.
[01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:51.160]   Oh, I hate macro blocking, whatever that is.
[01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:52.160]   Let's take a break.
[01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:54.680]   We're going to get your picks of the week ladies in just a moment.
[01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:58.480]   But first I want to tell everybody about audible.com.
[01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:01.120]   It's a great place to get audio books.
[01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:02.600]   I live on audio books.
[01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:04.720]   I know Andy you do too.
[01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:10.840]   Listening to a podcast course means that you must like audio in your car at your commute
[01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:16.760]   at the gym when you're working at home and boy, audible really makes it come alive.
[01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:25.280]   75,000 titles that give you just, you know, everything best sellers fiction, nonfiction.
[01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:27.840]   I listened to a lot of history.
[01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:32.440]   Some wonderful mysteries that the girl with the dragon tattoo, the Stig Larson millennium
[01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:36.880]   trilogy that's very popular right now in audio audible and I'm loving that.
[01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:40.600]   But also sci-fi science and technology.
[01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:43.600]   There is a lot on audible.com.
[01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:49.080]   Consider it really kind of like your, your, your bookstore, your library where you can
[01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:50.080]   instantly get a book.
[01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:53.560]   It takes about a minute at most to download a book, even at the highest quality for your
[01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:58.080]   iPad, your iPhone, your iPod, it's my Android phones.
[01:15:58.080 --> 01:15:59.880]   I love the Apple app too.
[01:15:59.880 --> 01:16:02.240]   If you played with the app now on the iPhone, it's great.
[01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:03.240]   It's my cleaning buddy.
[01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:04.240]   Yeah.
[01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:05.240]   Yeah.
[01:16:05.240 --> 01:16:07.600]   When you clean, who wants to want to clean is a waste of time and I can't usually, you
[01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:10.040]   know, and reading for me is kind of, I don't like to read.
[01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:12.040]   But like, like to me, I don't like to unitesk.
[01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:13.040]   I don't want to unitesk.
[01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:15.840]   So I want to get that information in and cleaning is kind of this thing that happens
[01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:16.840]   in the background.
[01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:19.280]   Like you don't need to be thinking, so you can be, you can be listening to audible and
[01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:22.680]   absorbing some cool information while you're making your house more present.
[01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:26.080]   I suddenly understand this is multi, this is for multitaskers, isn't it?
[01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:27.080]   It is.
[01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:28.080]   I get it now.
[01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:29.080]   You don't want to be a unit asker.
[01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:30.080]   We're not uniteskers.
[01:16:30.080 --> 01:16:31.080]   Yeah.
[01:16:31.080 --> 01:16:32.080]   We're not unit askers.
[01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:33.080]   We're multitaskers.
[01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:37.320]   So they have it for Android and iPhone and iPod touch and Blackberry, these great audible
[01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:38.320]   apps.
[01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:39.920]   I'd love to see one for the iPad as well.
[01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:43.120]   What's nice about that is your whole library is there so you can download any book any
[01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:44.760]   time, which is really nice.
[01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:47.360]   Andy, do you have a favorite you're listening to these days?
[01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:49.880]   Yes, I'm actually getting caught up.
[01:16:49.880 --> 01:16:53.360]   I finished Operation Mincemeat a couple of weeks ago, which will go down as one of my
[01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:54.800]   favorite audio books ever.
[01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:56.680]   It was just such a great book.
[01:16:56.680 --> 01:17:02.200]   Although it did show off one disadvantage of audio books because I was driving along
[01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:06.440]   and it's this story about World War II spy operation.
[01:17:06.440 --> 01:17:09.880]   And I get to the section where they're talking about how there was a small hitch because
[01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:15.040]   one of their spies was recently arrested in Spain, dressed as a middle aged woman.
[01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:16.040]   Exactly.
[01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:22.280]   Describe you that well was on and he was photographed in drag and then photographed by
[01:17:22.280 --> 01:17:27.880]   the police, not in drag anymore, describing a look of demure contentment wearing his wearing
[01:17:27.880 --> 01:17:29.360]   full length opera gloves.
[01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:33.120]   And as it happened about five minutes after like I'm driving like home, I have to listen
[01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:36.840]   to this five minutes after that, I pass by like a strip mall with a Barnes and Noble.
[01:17:36.840 --> 01:17:40.960]   And I'm like, I'm going to have to pull in, see if they have a copy of this book and see
[01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:45.240]   if there's a picture of this mid 40s guy and in Doge or drag.
[01:17:45.240 --> 01:17:47.920]   Because unfortunately, it's the one thing you do not get from the audio book.
[01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:54.080]   Yeah, it was it was worth pulling over because it was like Alec Guinness and as the queen
[01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:55.080]   in the mouth that.
[01:17:55.080 --> 01:17:56.080]   Funny.
[01:17:56.080 --> 01:18:03.280]   Anyway, so I had to get that book because you you really love that book.
[01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:04.280]   I love that book.
[01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:08.160]   Especially because the guy who reads it has a natural British accent.
[01:18:08.160 --> 01:18:12.120]   He can also do like all the different regional accents that are required when they're reading
[01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:14.680]   letters from like American generals and stuff like that.
[01:18:14.680 --> 01:18:20.480]   But overall, his accent is just like the scene in every really good World War II film where
[01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:24.920]   like the the the the the the the Royal Air Force, like Major has a riding crop and is like
[01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:28.560]   slapping at parts of a map saying, wait, we need to we mean to harass Jerry.
[01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:29.560]   Yeah.
[01:18:29.560 --> 01:18:30.560]   Yeah.
[01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:35.040]   And that's the that's the voice he does like for like 400 500 pages.
[01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:38.560]   As I said, I'll start to finish great story.
[01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:42.040]   Well told and also well well well played.
[01:18:42.040 --> 01:18:43.440]   So I'm just finished.
[01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:44.680]   I'm most fish getting caught up.
[01:18:44.680 --> 01:18:47.680]   I'm nearly at the end of pictures of a revolution, which is another book that's really working
[01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:48.680]   out well.
[01:18:48.680 --> 01:18:54.720]   The so my next recommendation or books by a series of books that I read in paperback
[01:18:54.720 --> 01:18:58.440]   have not read listened to an audio yet, although I purchased them.
[01:18:58.440 --> 01:19:04.080]   Woody Allen has recently agreed to do audio books of all of his books of short fiction.
[01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:08.480]   So my fix this week is the Woody Allen collection without feathers getting getting even near
[01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:10.800]   anarchy and side effects.
[01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:14.640]   And so they're going to read them, which you got it because it's his voice, you know,
[01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:15.640]   exactly.
[01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:18.640]   And it gets you forget that he started off as a stand up, right?
[01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:23.000]   And so his he his his stand up records are still some of the top records ever done in
[01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:24.240]   stand up comedy.
[01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:29.000]   There are people who have certain taste and breeding if you if you just simply tell the
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.280]   story of the moose.
[01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:37.000]   They will be all and so the Rosenbergs carried the moose into the into the body.
[01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:38.480]   Remember this vividly.
[01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:43.280]   It's just the way he says moose.
[01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:45.680]   The rosings they want.
[01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:46.680]   Sorry.
[01:19:46.680 --> 01:19:48.640]   I'm about to do the entire moose.
[01:19:48.640 --> 01:19:49.640]   Don't do the moose.
[01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:50.640]   Just tell people they can get it.
[01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:55.120]   I'm going to tell you that is a large collection of stories.
[01:19:55.120 --> 01:19:56.120]   Mostly he wrote these books.
[01:19:56.120 --> 01:19:59.320]   I believe in the late 60s and early 70s, but it's him reading them.
[01:19:59.320 --> 01:20:02.720]   The funny one of the funniest parts though is that starts off with you also get a 30
[01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:06.120]   minute special interview with him in which he complains that he really hates.
[01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:07.160]   He really hated doing this.
[01:20:07.160 --> 01:20:10.680]   He doesn't feel as though audio was the right format for its materials that was designed
[01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:12.560]   to be read and not to be read.
[01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:13.560]   He's so neurotic.
[01:20:13.560 --> 01:20:16.800]   If you were ever happy doing anything, you'd know to be the wrong thing.
[01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:19.840]   Let me play a little bit of Woody Allen from the Woody Allen collection.
[01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:20.840]   This is available for you.
[01:20:20.840 --> 01:20:23.800]   I'm going home from a high state, steal some pyjamas to sleep in.
[01:20:23.800 --> 01:20:26.400]   If it was a hot night, I'd steal underwear.
[01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:27.960]   It was a way of life.
[01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:30.600]   I had a bad upbringing, you might say.
[01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:33.360]   My dad was always on the road from the cops and I never thought.
[01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:34.360]   I think it's his normal.
[01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:35.360]   I think it's a studied affect.
[01:20:35.360 --> 01:20:39.960]   I think the character, the Nebuchy character, he created as a comic and goes through his
[01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:41.480]   movies is really a character.
[01:20:41.480 --> 01:20:43.040]   I have a feeling.
[01:20:43.040 --> 01:20:48.360]   I've read a biography of him that claims that a lot of it is just in the real.
[01:20:48.360 --> 01:20:51.800]   He has stated that the real him is nothing like his film persona.
[01:20:51.800 --> 01:20:56.760]   It pictures a revolution out of a section where Warren Beatty has hired a young Woody
[01:20:56.760 --> 01:21:00.280]   Allen to write his next movie forum.
[01:21:00.280 --> 01:21:01.520]   What's new pussycat?
[01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:07.240]   Which part of his, Woody Allen agreed to take less money if he were allowed to write one
[01:21:07.240 --> 01:21:10.840]   small part for him that was supposed to be five pages long.
[01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:12.600]   And it's striking on it right now.
[01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:17.320]   At this stage, 70 minutes of the movie is now about Woody Allen's character.
[01:21:17.320 --> 01:21:20.400]   Warren Beatty has been turned into the second banana.
[01:21:20.400 --> 01:21:27.760]   And it is like the Woody Allen Nebuchy character who like, he's, he's, he definitely, that's
[01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:33.600]   definitely a calculated move on his part to be a silent film character with who talks.
[01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:34.600]   Absolutely.
[01:21:34.600 --> 01:21:35.600]   Great selection.
[01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:36.600]   Really?
[01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:37.600]   I love the books.
[01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:38.600]   I haven't listened.
[01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:39.600]   I have purchased the audio book.
[01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:42.080]   I've not listened to it yet, but I've read all these books and it was one of those things
[01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:45.120]   where, okay, let's buy the next one.
[01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:47.120]   That was, okay, let's buy the third one.
[01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:48.600]   It's like, oh, there's another one left.
[01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:50.320]   Okay, let's buy that one too.
[01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:53.440]   Over the course, I remember a course of one summer where I discovered the series of books
[01:21:53.440 --> 01:21:55.240]   and was just, is there another one?
[01:21:55.240 --> 01:21:57.280]   Okay, let's buy that one too.
[01:21:57.280 --> 01:22:03.000]   I, I, I, I, I want to let mention if you're already now this, you can get for free if
[01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:06.320]   you're not an audible member by going to audible.com/macbreak.
[01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:10.400]   You sign up for the gold account, you get one book a month and this could be your choice.
[01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:12.400]   And, and you can cancel anytime and keep the book.
[01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:13.800]   So it's really is free.
[01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:16.160]   I should mention if you're already an audible member and I know a lot of people listen to
[01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:20.520]   the show have become audible members because of the show, they have a free selection, I
[01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:23.480]   think of Woody Allen on there as well for existing members.
[01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:25.280]   So you can get something free too.
[01:22:25.280 --> 01:22:27.880]   Audible.com/macbreak.
[01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:31.560]   Now it's time for our picks of the week and let's start with Alex actually.
[01:22:31.560 --> 01:22:33.320]   Alex, let's see if I can get this to work here.
[01:22:33.320 --> 01:22:34.320]   Hold on.
[01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:35.320]   You never tried to do this with my iPad.
[01:22:35.320 --> 01:22:36.320]   You're doing it with a pad.
[01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:39.320]   You want me to hold it up for you on camera five or?
[01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:40.320]   Here we go.
[01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:41.320]   I can, I can help you with that.
[01:22:41.320 --> 01:22:42.320]   Let's see.
[01:22:42.320 --> 01:22:43.320]   You know, I, I'll show you.
[01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:44.320]   That's it.
[01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:45.320]   Whoa.
[01:22:45.320 --> 01:22:46.320]   What is it?
[01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:47.320]   You hear me?
[01:22:47.320 --> 01:22:48.320]   Hello?
[01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:49.320]   Hello?
[01:22:49.320 --> 01:22:50.320]   Hello?
[01:22:50.320 --> 01:22:51.320]   Are you talking to the.
[01:22:51.320 --> 01:22:54.320]   I'm talking to my iPhone and it's, I mean, I'm having my iPad.
[01:22:54.320 --> 01:22:58.280]   It's not so cool.
[01:22:58.280 --> 01:22:59.600]   Is there a use for this?
[01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:00.600]   There.
[01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:02.320]   Yes, there is a use.
[01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:03.320]   Okay.
[01:23:03.320 --> 01:23:05.320]   So this is, this is called Waki-Tok-e Pro here.
[01:23:05.320 --> 01:23:06.320]   I'll turn this on.
[01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:08.240]   So this is called Waki-Tok-e Pro.
[01:23:08.240 --> 01:23:12.880]   And the advantage of this is that it's not just iPhone to iPhone or iPad to iPad.
[01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:18.520]   This is the, the ability to do many iPhones onto a single channel.
[01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:20.880]   So basically your iPad becomes a Waki-Tok-e?
[01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:21.880]   Yeah.
[01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:26.520]   So if you're on the same Wifi network, everybody can be Waki-Tok-e-ed in.
[01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:27.520]   This began as a, as a.
[01:23:27.520 --> 01:23:30.240]   So we could have meetings, but we could all be at different rooms in the house.
[01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:31.240]   No, no, no.
[01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:34.040]   You're ruining everything.
[01:23:34.040 --> 01:23:38.480]   So, so it's like, it's like having six Waki-Tok-e's alternate to the same channel, where everyone
[01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:39.480]   can hear whatever.
[01:23:39.480 --> 01:23:41.200]   As long as you're on the Wifi area, but that's the problem.
[01:23:41.200 --> 01:23:42.440]   Yeah, but to be within Wifi.
[01:23:42.440 --> 01:23:44.520]   Or you have to be within Waki-Tok-e range.
[01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:47.200]   I mean, that's a pretty common need.
[01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:49.720]   And the, I'm trying to figure out how to.
[01:23:49.720 --> 01:23:53.880]   So it doesn't work over a 3G or it only works over a Wifi.
[01:23:53.880 --> 01:23:56.600]   It sounds like we're part guessing in the old bar.
[01:23:56.600 --> 01:23:57.600]   Here's the thing is that what we-
[01:23:57.600 --> 01:24:00.200]   Today, I could sit in myself.
[01:24:00.200 --> 01:24:01.200]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:04.880]   So what we, what we needed for is specifically what, well, the first reason that I got it,
[01:24:04.880 --> 01:24:08.400]   I downloaded a bunch of Waki-Tok-e apps because I wanted a quick baby monitor where I could
[01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:11.160]   throw one of these, I took my old iPhone through it into the-
[01:24:11.160 --> 01:24:14.200]   You can give your baby the iPhone and then you can listen to her make calls.
[01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:15.200]   Right, exactly.
[01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:16.440]   And so, and I skyped it.
[01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:19.880]   You know, Skype was the first solution that I used.
[01:24:19.880 --> 01:24:23.040]   And then, and then what I was like, "Ah, this has got to be a better way."
[01:24:23.040 --> 01:24:27.840]   So I got this one and we tested it a lot and, you know, kind of used it.
[01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:28.840]   And we did it in the office.
[01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:29.840]   We had like six of them.
[01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:31.680]   So you can have a whole bunch of people on a channel.
[01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:32.840]   You're going to have a couple different channels.
[01:24:32.840 --> 01:24:36.920]   So like, for instance, if you have a camera crew and that camera crew, all, you know,
[01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:37.920]   all has a headset.
[01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:39.600]   Now is there an iPhone only version of this?
[01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:41.120]   Because it'd be great if you all had iPhones.
[01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:42.720]   They'd be like, "Push to talk almost."
[01:24:42.720 --> 01:24:47.960]   Well, the thing is, is that it works with the eye, you know, because it's Wifi, it works
[01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:49.280]   with the iPod touch as well.
[01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:50.280]   Right.
[01:24:50.280 --> 01:24:52.280]   So, so you can do, you know, you don't need 3G.
[01:24:52.280 --> 01:24:53.280]   Oh, that's kind of neat.
[01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:55.080]   Yeah, so you could have everybody talking to each other.
[01:24:55.080 --> 01:24:59.040]   It would be cool if it were 3G as well.
[01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:01.360]   It would be, but anybody like, "Push to talk."
[01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:03.440]   But what's nice is that it's really, really quick.
[01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:06.120]   You know, it's like you turn it on and then, and now you just hit, you know, I just want
[01:25:06.120 --> 01:25:13.840]   to, you know, and so what makes it great is being able to, you know, cheaply, you know,
[01:25:13.840 --> 01:25:16.480]   connect all of your, everyone on a crew or everyone on a phone.
[01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:22.600]   Caddetonic says this would be useful if you had, you blew a fuse and Dad goes down in
[01:25:22.600 --> 01:25:26.600]   the basement with his iPad and then he goes, "Is that it?"
[01:25:26.600 --> 01:25:28.280]   And then you could say, "No, that's not it."
[01:25:28.280 --> 01:25:29.280]   "Is that it?"
[01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:31.800]   Well, I mean, when you're, when you're working on a crew and when you're working, especially
[01:25:31.800 --> 01:25:35.280]   on a film crew, you know, they have, we, we, like, we were shooting on Friday in, in
[01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:36.280]   Sonoma, like Cornerstone.
[01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:37.280]   Have you been to Cornerstone?
[01:25:37.280 --> 01:25:38.280]   That was really nice.
[01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:40.680]   Anyway, but we were shooting and we all had the walkie-talkies.
[01:25:40.680 --> 01:25:43.320]   And so, but, so instead of yelling at each other, we can say, "Hey, I need you to turn
[01:25:43.320 --> 01:25:46.600]   the open up the exposure a little bit while I'm sitting at the mixer and I can tell everyone
[01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:48.880]   quietly to, you know, where they all need to go."
[01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:51.400]   And so that's what the walkie-talkies are really useful for, but being able to do that
[01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:54.920]   effectively, you know, and we all have iPhones and it was kind of like, "There's got to be
[01:25:54.920 --> 01:25:55.920]   something on the iPhone."
[01:25:55.920 --> 01:25:59.600]   Oh, it turns out there's a whole bunch of walkie-talkie apps.
[01:25:59.600 --> 01:26:01.280]   I bought them all for you.
[01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:02.800]   I took a bullet for our listeners.
[01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:03.800]   Thank you.
[01:26:03.800 --> 01:26:06.000]   So I went out and bought, bought all of them and tried them.
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:07.680]   Do we have different channels or is that just a lie?
[01:26:07.680 --> 01:26:08.680]   Just drag that.
[01:26:08.680 --> 01:26:09.680]   Yeah.
[01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:10.680]   Oh, look.
[01:26:10.680 --> 01:26:11.680]   So you can have lots of people on different channels.
[01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:13.720]   So, channel two, how are you?
[01:26:13.720 --> 01:26:14.720]   We're running.
[01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:15.720]   Channel nine.
[01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:16.720]   Are you ready?
[01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:17.720]   Or you can have everybody.
[01:26:17.720 --> 01:26:18.720]   Yeah.
[01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:20.520]   So it, this one, what's, what's BIP?
[01:26:20.520 --> 01:26:24.600]   That's so you can, at the beginning or at the end of a, at the end of a, you know, you
[01:26:24.600 --> 01:26:39.120]   can have it.
[01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:44.280]   So the, the pro version will cost you 99 cents.
[01:26:44.280 --> 01:26:46.480]   It's really, really exposed.
[01:26:46.480 --> 01:26:47.480]   It's an iPhone app.
[01:26:47.480 --> 01:26:48.480]   It is an iPhone app.
[01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:49.480]   That one zoomed up.
[01:26:49.480 --> 01:26:52.320]   So, so it's more useful on the iPhone than the iPad.
[01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:53.320]   It's just that that's how I could show it.
[01:26:53.320 --> 01:26:55.600]   It turns all the iPhones into, that's really cool.
[01:26:55.600 --> 01:26:56.600]   A walkie-talkie.
[01:26:56.600 --> 01:26:57.840]   It's a walkie-talkie pro.
[01:26:57.840 --> 01:27:01.040]   Yeah, you may have, you may have noticed, if I'm going to do my, I'm also doing, yeah,
[01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:04.360]   someone's pointing out you can't do Morris code if you know it.
[01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:12.280]   So, you notice when I show iPads on TV, you get that, you get a lot of reflection, you
[01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:14.760]   get, you see the fingerprints and stuff.
[01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:15.760]   And it's been driving me crazy.
[01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:19.520]   Steve Gibson recommended something which I put on my iPad.
[01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:20.520]   And look at this.
[01:27:20.520 --> 01:27:21.520]   Look at this.
[01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:27.040]   It's just as easy to read, but the reflection is, it is a matte finish for your glossy iPad.
[01:27:27.040 --> 01:27:29.440]   I'm still getting reflection, but it's, you know, not as bad.
[01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:34.600]   And it's really, it's a huge help for us in shooting the iPad.
[01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:40.360]   So if you wish not to have a glossy iPad, you can put this film on here.
[01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:44.880]   It's from a company called I Love at i-love.com.
[01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:47.960]   Now, you cannot get it at the Apple store.
[01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:48.960]   Probably not.
[01:27:48.960 --> 01:27:50.200]   Because it's, you know, we only make glossy.
[01:27:50.200 --> 01:27:51.400]   I'm sorry.
[01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:53.840]   But you can get it on Amazon for about 15 bucks.
[01:27:53.840 --> 01:27:55.320]   It's $20 from the I Love site.
[01:27:55.320 --> 01:27:57.320]   Now, like here's the caveats.
[01:27:57.320 --> 01:28:01.240]   It is a, it's almost impossible to put on.
[01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:04.680]   But they send you with it, they send you two sheets.
[01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:05.680]   That's great.
[01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:08.400]   Steve Gibson told me, he said, just think of the first sheet as practice because you will
[01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:09.560]   not get it.
[01:28:09.560 --> 01:28:11.040]   So I said, no, no, I will get it.
[01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:12.320]   I'm going to get this on two different.
[01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:16.480]   And he was right, partly because if there's even the tiniest speck of dust, it shows up
[01:28:16.480 --> 01:28:19.000]   as a bubble and you can't get rid of the bubble.
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:23.320]   So what you end up doing is putting the first one on learning like the skills of this.
[01:28:23.320 --> 01:28:27.200]   And also it picks up all the dust that was on there, right?
[01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:29.240]   And so then you immediately do the second one.
[01:28:29.240 --> 01:28:33.200]   And I was able to get the second one on here without, I'll try to get something.
[01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:35.960]   Yeah, when it's a black screen, you can really see there's no bubbles.
[01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:39.360]   It's really, it really did a nice job.
[01:28:39.360 --> 01:28:41.080]   It is absolutely a matte finish.
[01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:42.960]   There's a little, no, that's just a dot.
[01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:44.440]   Yeah, there's no, there's no bubbles.
[01:28:44.440 --> 01:28:47.920]   It does also eliminate some of the fingerprint issues.
[01:28:47.920 --> 01:28:49.120]   But you got to like Matt's screen.
[01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:53.680]   So if you want a matte screen for $15, don't think of it as $15 for two.
[01:28:53.680 --> 01:28:54.960]   The first one's for practice.
[01:28:54.960 --> 01:28:58.760]   It is a pain in the butt, but it does in fact work.
[01:28:58.760 --> 01:29:01.320]   There's a lot of manufacturers that have been doing these where they're shipping them
[01:29:01.320 --> 01:29:02.320]   as a group.
[01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:05.600]   The one that I got, I can't think of the name of it right now, the front that I use for
[01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:08.640]   my eye, for my iPhone, it came with like three of them.
[01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:10.080]   And you think, oh, I can put it on three phones.
[01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:11.560]   No, it just takes a couple of practices.
[01:29:11.560 --> 01:29:13.240]   And then you're not bummed when you get it.
[01:29:13.240 --> 01:29:15.120]   I won't even buy one now that doesn't have multiple.
[01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:16.620]   You should have multiple.
[01:29:16.620 --> 01:29:17.960]   People have asked how does it feel?
[01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:18.960]   It feels very smooth.
[01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:20.480]   It is not sticky.
[01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:22.120]   It is not tacky at all.
[01:29:22.120 --> 01:29:23.120]   It's very easy.
[01:29:23.120 --> 01:29:25.960]   In fact, I kind of like that the touch feel to it.
[01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:28.960]   It doesn't, it's a nice touch.
[01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:32.640]   It is almost a little bit, it's certainly as almost as smooth as a glass.
[01:29:32.640 --> 01:29:36.000]   There's no residual stuff.
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.880]   And it probably will help you a little bit if you're on an airplane, although you can
[01:29:38.880 --> 01:29:40.920]   still see it even at an angle.
[01:29:40.920 --> 01:29:41.920]   I'm very happy.
[01:29:41.920 --> 01:29:43.160]   It does not dim it appreciably.
[01:29:43.160 --> 01:29:48.140]   You can see it still looks pretty good compared, let's compare it to Alex's unmodified.
[01:29:48.140 --> 01:29:50.500]   You can see it isn't quite as bright.
[01:29:50.500 --> 01:29:54.660]   It does dim it down, but it just doesn't have those reflection issues.
[01:29:54.660 --> 01:29:56.900]   And I really have to say I've been very happy with it.
[01:29:56.900 --> 01:29:59.460]   So the i-love, would I put it on all my iPads?
[01:29:59.460 --> 01:30:00.460]   Probably not.
[01:30:00.460 --> 01:30:01.460]   I don't mind glossy.
[01:30:01.460 --> 01:30:02.460]   I get glossy screens.
[01:30:02.460 --> 01:30:04.300]   But for the one we shoot on camera, this is great.
[01:30:04.300 --> 01:30:05.300]   i-l-u-v.com.
[01:30:05.300 --> 01:30:08.420]   Thanks to Steve Gibson for that recommendation.
[01:30:08.420 --> 01:30:12.940]   And now, before we go, Andy Anakko's pick of the week.
[01:30:12.940 --> 01:30:15.120]   Mine is an ePub creator.
[01:30:15.120 --> 01:30:19.440]   I've been trying every single app for building ePubs out of manuscripts.
[01:30:19.440 --> 01:30:22.240]   And I finally found the mechanism that I really, really like.
[01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:24.920]   It's an open source program called Sigil.
[01:30:24.920 --> 01:30:29.240]   And this is just the results just on the iPad here.
[01:30:29.240 --> 01:30:33.080]   It seems as though you have three, if you want to build ePubs, you have three or four
[01:30:33.080 --> 01:30:34.080]   different solutions.
[01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:40.920]   One of them is to just use Stanza, which can give you a very simple drag and drop sort
[01:30:40.920 --> 01:30:41.920]   of book.
[01:30:41.920 --> 01:30:44.840]   It's very, very bare bones, but it will put it into an ePub format so you can read it
[01:30:44.840 --> 01:30:49.440]   on your phone, read it on your Sony reader, read it on whatever other device you have.
[01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:53.480]   If you want to do something a little bit more sophisticated, where it has things like it
[01:30:53.480 --> 01:30:58.400]   has a coverage, it has an actual graphical cover that'll show up in the bookcase, where
[01:30:58.400 --> 01:31:02.160]   it'll have an actual table of contents where you can actually affect the formatting and
[01:31:02.160 --> 01:31:05.400]   fine tune it, however, however, however, really you want.
[01:31:05.400 --> 01:31:07.840]   There are really only three different solutions.
[01:31:07.840 --> 01:31:10.080]   There's Adobe InDesign, which costs a lot of money.
[01:31:10.080 --> 01:31:15.000]   It is truly a professional tool that takes a long time to really learn and is probably
[01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:19.240]   more bother than most people would want to go through.
[01:31:19.240 --> 01:31:26.000]   There is also an open source app called Caliber, which I'm sure is very useful, but it is every
[01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:29.840]   bad thing you imagine from open source software.
[01:31:29.840 --> 01:31:32.240]   The user interface is just horrible.
[01:31:32.240 --> 01:31:34.200]   Every function has a different button for it.
[01:31:34.200 --> 01:31:37.520]   Some of the buttons contradict, some of the other buttons is just terrible.
[01:31:37.520 --> 01:31:41.480]   Exhigil, however, is head and shoulders the best solution for almost anybody who might
[01:31:41.480 --> 01:31:42.680]   want to use it.
[01:31:42.680 --> 01:31:47.800]   It's a very easy to use, very, very powerful tool, whether what you want to do is simply
[01:31:47.800 --> 01:31:52.320]   take a long text, it's simply on your hard drive, and turn it into a book so that you
[01:31:52.320 --> 01:31:56.840]   can have your employee operation manual look on your iPad and read it that way.
[01:31:56.840 --> 01:32:00.800]   All the way to being an author who wants to self-publish and wants to create an ePub
[01:32:00.800 --> 01:32:03.600]   that looks polished and professional.
[01:32:03.600 --> 01:32:08.240]   If you want to do it in three steps, open up a text file or an HTML file, click three
[01:32:08.240 --> 01:32:09.760]   buttons and it will turn it into an ePub.
[01:32:09.760 --> 01:32:11.520]   That's the stance of solution.
[01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:15.600]   But if you want to make it polished, not only can you do things like add chapter sections
[01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:20.960]   and table of contents and footnotes, you can also open up a split screen view so that one
[01:32:20.960 --> 01:32:24.440]   pane will show you what it's supposed to look like when people are actually reading it.
[01:32:24.440 --> 01:32:27.880]   Meanwhile, in another pane, you're looking at the actual HTML that's going to define
[01:32:27.880 --> 01:32:28.880]   it.
[01:32:28.880 --> 01:32:34.040]   I want this section heading to be on a colored background with a border around it and I want
[01:32:34.040 --> 01:32:35.680]   it to be a larger font size.
[01:32:35.680 --> 01:32:41.120]   You can just simply add one line of standard CSS to it and bang, it's done.
[01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:45.480]   If you want to affect the positioning of a piece of graphic, again, just add a little
[01:32:45.480 --> 01:32:50.080]   -- you can either use built-in word processor type tools to insert the graphic and decide
[01:32:50.080 --> 01:32:53.880]   how it should be positioned, or you can add a little bit of CSS and do it that way.
[01:32:53.880 --> 01:32:57.280]   So I'm obviously looking at it more from a point of view of someone who wants to publish
[01:32:57.280 --> 01:32:59.880]   and sell stuff through ePub.
[01:32:59.880 --> 01:33:04.520]   But I've -- I mean, I already have got at least like four or five different books in
[01:33:04.520 --> 01:33:10.120]   my library that are nothing but like homemade, sigil-style books.
[01:33:10.120 --> 01:33:15.120]   This is a long article from The Village Voice that was long enough I wanted to actually
[01:33:15.120 --> 01:33:17.520]   read it while I was having lunch.
[01:33:17.520 --> 01:33:20.400]   And again, it took me about five minutes to turn it to something that I could really
[01:33:20.400 --> 01:33:22.280]   just enjoy wherever I go.
[01:33:22.280 --> 01:33:29.040]   I've turned like 300-page books that I previously had scanned and just converted with stanza
[01:33:29.040 --> 01:33:30.040]   as a quick and dirty thing.
[01:33:30.040 --> 01:33:32.400]   I've talked about like commercial books that are just out of print.
[01:33:32.400 --> 01:33:34.600]   Some of my favorite books, I've scanned some of my favorite books.
[01:33:34.600 --> 01:33:37.720]   If I read them like once or twice a year, they're with turning it to ePub.
[01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:41.400]   And it took me all of like 20 minutes to turn it from a very quick and dirty sort of ePub
[01:33:41.400 --> 01:33:46.320]   translation to something that if I paid $4.99 for it in the iBooks store, I would not have
[01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:50.440]   bad it in iO because it looks like what I would expect an actual iBooks store book to
[01:33:50.440 --> 01:33:51.440]   look like.
[01:33:51.440 --> 01:33:54.200]   What is the iPad after you created?
[01:33:54.200 --> 01:33:55.520]   It's just a standard ePub file.
[01:33:55.520 --> 01:33:59.040]   So you just drag it onto iTunes just like you would any other ePub file.
[01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:03.200]   It will show up in your books library or any other device you have that will work with
[01:34:03.200 --> 01:34:04.200]   ePub files.
[01:34:04.200 --> 01:34:08.680]   I believe you can even email it to yourself or add it to your Dropbox and your standard
[01:34:08.680 --> 01:34:12.960]   viewer launcher will know to launch any pub viewer in order to view it.
[01:34:12.960 --> 01:34:15.240]   But it's true device independence.
[01:34:15.240 --> 01:34:19.800]   That's why I was talking about earlier how I sort of had to train myself to let go of
[01:34:19.800 --> 01:34:24.240]   the idea that I can control how people are going to, how this is going to look to every
[01:34:24.240 --> 01:34:28.840]   single user that the less hard formatting you put into this book, the better.
[01:34:28.840 --> 01:34:32.640]   But an application like Sigil allows you to make those little tweaks that are very easy
[01:34:32.640 --> 01:34:40.040]   to do and will translate to any device, whether it's a Sony reader, a nook, a phone, an Android
[01:34:40.040 --> 01:34:41.520]   or an iPad.
[01:34:41.520 --> 01:34:42.600]   And it's open source.
[01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:45.440]   It's available for Windows, Linux, Linux, and Mac.
[01:34:45.440 --> 01:34:47.400]   And it's absolutely free.
[01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:50.760]   This is great, great, great app, very, very polished.
[01:34:50.760 --> 01:34:53.200]   I would pay 20 bucks for it if it were $19.99.
[01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:59.200]   And this really will empower people to self-publish in a form that you could then put on almost
[01:34:59.200 --> 01:35:00.200]   any platform.
[01:35:00.200 --> 01:35:01.200]   I think that's really great.
[01:35:01.200 --> 01:35:03.120]   Can no support ePub?
[01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:04.120]   No.
[01:35:04.120 --> 01:35:05.960]   No, nothing does.
[01:35:05.960 --> 01:35:09.040]   Nook has ePub as one of its standard formats.
[01:35:09.040 --> 01:35:11.640]   Sony reader also supports ePub as a standard format.
[01:35:11.640 --> 01:35:17.080]   I've known of a couple of people who now that there is an app kit for Android have announced
[01:35:17.080 --> 01:35:19.000]   they're going to come up with an ePub reader for it.
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:20.400]   I haven't actually seen.
[01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:24.720]   Well, you could also get a nook application on Android and that would read it.
[01:35:24.720 --> 01:35:25.720]   I presume.
[01:35:25.720 --> 01:35:26.720]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:28.640]   Do you mean Android or Kindle?
[01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:31.120]   Kindle is what I'm curious about.
[01:35:31.120 --> 01:35:33.960]   I believe there's an app.
[01:35:33.960 --> 01:35:37.520]   There's an actual app development kit for Kindle.
[01:35:37.520 --> 01:35:41.800]   I have talked to a couple of people who have said that they want to build an ePub reader
[01:35:41.800 --> 01:35:44.120]   that will run on the Kindle.
[01:35:44.120 --> 01:35:45.720]   And Amazon says they don't care.
[01:35:45.720 --> 01:35:46.720]   Go ahead.
[01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:49.680]   Are you reading these on the Kindle or the iPad?
[01:35:49.680 --> 01:35:50.680]   iPad.
[01:35:50.680 --> 01:35:59.040]   I really think that the iBook reader is a much more pleasant and a much nicer reading experience
[01:35:59.040 --> 01:36:00.240]   than the Kindle reader.
[01:36:00.240 --> 01:36:02.400]   I think that they really need to.
[01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:08.520]   Amazon needs to retune what the parents of the text is like how it lays it out automatically
[01:36:08.520 --> 01:36:12.120]   unless it's specifically guided by the definition in the ePub.
[01:36:12.120 --> 01:36:14.440]   I just think that iBooks does a much better job of it.
[01:36:14.440 --> 01:36:20.360]   I really wish that I could have the Amazon Kindle store with the iBooks reader attached
[01:36:20.360 --> 01:36:22.840]   to it and that I would really have the best of both worlds.
[01:36:22.840 --> 01:36:28.360]   Unfortunately, we're still not in a position where if you're looking for a specific book
[01:36:28.360 --> 01:36:32.440]   on the iBook store, you're lucky to find it in an iBook store, whereas if it's not available
[01:36:32.440 --> 01:36:34.000]   on the Kindle store, that's just not available.
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.080]   Yeah, I have a couple of Kindle books that I bought.
[01:36:36.080 --> 01:36:40.080]   They're math for animation and computer graphics and stuff like that.
[01:36:40.080 --> 01:36:42.960]   And then I can only find on the Kindle, you know, only find on Amazon.
[01:36:42.960 --> 01:36:46.680]   So I have them in my Kindle reader and I can go back and refer to it, but I have to admit,
[01:36:46.680 --> 01:36:49.680]   when I go to the iBook, I'm just like, "Really?
[01:36:49.680 --> 01:36:51.160]   Can I have it here?"
[01:36:51.160 --> 01:36:54.600]   Although everything really is exploding.
[01:36:54.600 --> 01:36:59.480]   Just today Barnes and Noble announced that they have now an iPhone and iPad versions
[01:36:59.480 --> 01:37:01.360]   of the Nook reader software.
[01:37:01.360 --> 01:37:02.360]   That's what I'm referring to.
[01:37:02.360 --> 01:37:07.080]   If you're actually one of the people who are buying digital books from Barnes and Noble,
[01:37:07.080 --> 01:37:08.080]   okay, fine.
[01:37:08.080 --> 01:37:09.080]   Good.
[01:37:09.080 --> 01:37:10.080]   Free time.
[01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:11.080]   Great.
[01:37:11.080 --> 01:37:14.200]   I would buy a book through Barnes and Noble rather than Amazon, but okay.
[01:37:14.200 --> 01:37:19.200]   If you have an iPad, though, would there be any reason to buy a Kindle version if it
[01:37:19.200 --> 01:37:21.600]   was available also in the iBook store?
[01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:23.720]   I buy Kindle versions so I can run on multiple platforms.
[01:37:23.720 --> 01:37:25.200]   Yeah, that's the answer.
[01:37:25.200 --> 01:37:26.200]   That's the answer.
[01:37:26.200 --> 01:37:27.200]   Until I'm...
[01:37:27.200 --> 01:37:28.200]   I don't see...
[01:37:28.200 --> 01:37:34.560]   I'm going to have to re-look at the iBooks because to me, I always use Kindle.
[01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:35.560]   But maybe it's better.
[01:37:35.560 --> 01:37:36.560]   I have to look at it.
[01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:38.640]   I think it's the multi-platform thing.
[01:37:38.640 --> 01:37:43.160]   I would prefer to buy my ePubs totally unlocked and free of DRM, but I know that's not going
[01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:45.120]   to happen within the next five years.
[01:37:45.120 --> 01:37:49.760]   The next best thing is a company that says, "Well, name a device that you have."
[01:37:49.760 --> 01:37:50.760]   Well, great.
[01:37:50.760 --> 01:37:51.760]   You have a reader for that.
[01:37:51.760 --> 01:37:52.760]   Well, you forgot that.
[01:37:52.760 --> 01:37:53.760]   You have that device too.
[01:37:53.760 --> 01:37:54.760]   Probably.
[01:37:54.760 --> 01:37:55.760]   The only thing you can't...
[01:37:55.760 --> 01:37:56.760]   Yeah, so, okay.
[01:37:56.760 --> 01:37:57.760]   On that basis, great.
[01:37:57.760 --> 01:38:01.800]   Oh, that's why I buy most of my digital books by Kindle.
[01:38:01.800 --> 01:38:02.800]   We are done.
[01:38:02.800 --> 01:38:03.800]   Thank you, gentlemen.
[01:38:03.800 --> 01:38:08.760]   The Enocho is the man in charge, professor in charge of technology at the Chicago Sun
[01:38:08.760 --> 01:38:09.760]   Times.
[01:38:09.760 --> 01:38:10.760]   He also...
[01:38:10.760 --> 01:38:11.760]   Oops, that's not his lower third.
[01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:12.760]   That's his lower third.
[01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:20.320]   He also blogs at the Celestial Waste of Banwith www.cwob.com, and he always great.
[01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:21.320]   Always a slice.
[01:38:21.320 --> 01:38:23.600]   I didn't know you were so interested in my lower third.
[01:38:23.600 --> 01:38:25.880]   Your lower third is even better than your upper third.
[01:38:25.880 --> 01:38:29.000]   And I don't know about that middle third, but we'll just...
[01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:30.760]   You are making me blushly.
[01:38:30.760 --> 01:38:34.280]   I love it when you talk TV.
[01:38:34.280 --> 01:38:38.160]   Alex Lindsey at the Pixel Core, the Pixel Core dot com for that great guild of multimedia
[01:38:38.160 --> 01:38:42.920]   artists, Pixel Core dot TV for the podcast they're of.
[01:38:42.920 --> 01:38:44.600]   Anything you want to plug?
[01:38:44.600 --> 01:38:50.120]   No, other than if you haven't seen Mac Break in 4K, it's up there.
[01:38:50.120 --> 01:38:51.120]   That's all I can say.
[01:38:51.120 --> 01:38:52.120]   You and everybody else.
[01:38:52.120 --> 01:38:54.320]   Well, you know that...
[01:38:54.320 --> 01:38:55.320]   We're taking...
[01:38:55.320 --> 01:38:58.640]   Let's take a little video and take bets on what time each one of us shave.
[01:38:58.640 --> 01:39:00.600]   You'll be able to find and figure it out by looking at one frame.
[01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:01.600]   Exactly.
[01:39:01.600 --> 01:39:04.120]   Well, if you do Chrome on a regular...
[01:39:04.120 --> 01:39:05.120]   You can see it.
[01:39:05.120 --> 01:39:06.520]   Now, what we have decided is a 20...
[01:39:06.520 --> 01:39:10.520]   Like whatever, 2740 or whatever, or whatever the high res is for the 27...
[01:39:10.520 --> 01:39:11.920]   So, it's noticeably better.
[01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:13.560]   Well, we're looking at making that the...
[01:39:13.560 --> 01:39:16.880]   You're not 4K, but making that maximum resolution so that, you know, because it doesn't...
[01:39:16.880 --> 01:39:18.040]   The 4K, yeah, it doesn't.
[01:39:18.040 --> 01:39:19.040]   We just did it because we couldn't...
[01:39:19.040 --> 01:39:22.160]   Nobody can watch it, but it's just the way you did the 1080p Mac Break originally.
[01:39:22.160 --> 01:39:23.320]   Nobody could watch that either.
[01:39:23.320 --> 01:39:24.320]   Exactly.
[01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:25.320]   Now they can.
[01:39:25.320 --> 01:39:26.320]   Exactly.
[01:39:26.320 --> 01:39:27.320]   Just a matter time.
[01:39:27.320 --> 01:39:28.320]   Just give them a couple of years.
[01:39:28.320 --> 01:39:31.280]   We're demanding that Lucas put Star Wars out in 4K.
[01:39:31.280 --> 01:39:32.280]   Ooh.
[01:39:32.280 --> 01:39:34.360]   That would be very hard for many...
[01:39:34.360 --> 01:39:37.280]   He said it was interesting because here's one of the richest men in the world.
[01:39:37.280 --> 01:39:39.760]   He says it's very expensive to make a Blu-ray.
[01:39:39.760 --> 01:39:41.320]   It's like, "Okay, George."
[01:39:41.320 --> 01:39:42.320]   Okay.
[01:39:42.320 --> 01:39:43.320]   He says...
[01:39:43.320 --> 01:39:45.280]   And the other thing I thought this was very interesting, we didn't want to make a Blu-ray
[01:39:45.280 --> 01:39:48.840]   because we made the DVD too soon, which was surprising to me because it didn't seem like
[01:39:48.840 --> 01:39:49.840]   it was soon at all.
[01:39:49.840 --> 01:39:52.800]   And it didn't sell as well.
[01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:57.080]   And we wanted to wait till Blu-ray had really taken off before we made the Blu-ray version.
[01:39:57.080 --> 01:39:58.960]   And now they said, "Well, we don't get to do it now.
[01:39:58.960 --> 01:40:00.400]   We're never going to do it because it's never been."
[01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:02.280]   This is pretty much Blu-ray's peak.
[01:40:02.280 --> 01:40:06.320]   And now we'd like to get it on Blu-ray while we can still sell it.
[01:40:06.320 --> 01:40:07.320]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:40:07.320 --> 01:40:08.320]   Before it's over.
[01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:09.320]   Right.
[01:40:09.320 --> 01:40:11.040]   Alex Linsiani and Aco and you.
[01:40:11.040 --> 01:40:12.560]   You're the most important person.
[01:40:12.560 --> 01:40:13.880]   Thank you for listening to Mac Break Weekly.
[01:40:13.880 --> 01:40:15.680]   Make sure you tune in if you want to watch it live.
[01:40:15.680 --> 01:40:23.000]   We do it every Tuesday morning, 11 AM Pacific, 2 PM Eastern or 1,800 UTC at live.twit.tv.
[01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:27.040]   You can also join our chatroom, irc.twit.tv and make fun of us while we're talking.
[01:40:27.040 --> 01:40:29.040]   I thought of one thing that I wanted to say.
[01:40:29.040 --> 01:40:30.040]   Yes, yeah.
[01:40:30.040 --> 01:40:31.040]   It just took me a little while.
[01:40:31.040 --> 01:40:32.040]   You caught me on the phone.
[01:40:32.040 --> 01:40:34.640]   Tomorrow we're going to be opening up our live stream.
[01:40:34.640 --> 01:40:35.640]   We do it about once a month.
[01:40:35.640 --> 01:40:37.920]   And so I'm going to be talking about HDR.
[01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:40.360]   You do it from the Pixelcore.
[01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:41.360]   Pixelcore offices.
[01:40:41.360 --> 01:40:42.360]   So I'm going to be talking about HDR.
[01:40:42.360 --> 01:40:45.080]   We do it every week for the Pixelcore, but we open it up about once a month for the public.
[01:40:45.080 --> 01:40:47.600]   I made the world's ugliest pixel, a pixel worm.
[01:40:47.600 --> 01:40:50.000]   The world's ugliest HDR over the weekend.
[01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:51.000]   It was really fun.
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:54.560]   Because we had to try to record the one and he told me to do Photomatics.
[01:40:54.560 --> 01:40:57.640]   And so I was playing with Photomatics, which is really fantastic.
[01:40:57.640 --> 01:41:00.800]   And I happened to have a picture from when I dropped I'll be off at college.
[01:41:00.800 --> 01:41:04.960]   So I turned it like all the things up to high.
[01:41:04.960 --> 01:41:05.960]   Oh, ow.
[01:41:05.960 --> 01:41:10.200]   And you said everything to Miami.
[01:41:10.200 --> 01:41:11.200]   Yeah.
[01:41:11.200 --> 01:41:12.640]   It's like Miami downtown.
[01:41:12.640 --> 01:41:13.640]   But yeah.
[01:41:13.640 --> 01:41:15.120]   And that's a tone map damage.
[01:41:15.120 --> 01:41:16.120]   What we're going to be talking about.
[01:41:16.120 --> 01:41:17.280]   It was kind of an interesting result.
[01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:19.840]   I mean, I think this is kind of, you know, I mean, it's interesting.
[01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:20.840]   Look at that.
[01:41:20.840 --> 01:41:21.840]   That was like a painting.
[01:41:21.840 --> 01:41:22.840]   Well, I was there.
[01:41:22.840 --> 01:41:23.840]   So it is a guy.
[01:41:23.840 --> 01:41:26.720]   It's a picture, but it does look just like a painting, which I like.
[01:41:26.720 --> 01:41:27.880]   Anyway, silly.
[01:41:27.880 --> 01:41:28.880]   Yeah.
[01:41:28.880 --> 01:41:30.440]   So but the that's a and that's a tone map.
[01:41:30.440 --> 01:41:33.840]   What we're going to be talking about is the what happens before a tone map image, which
[01:41:33.840 --> 01:41:37.480]   is the high dynamic range image that we use in computer graphics for lighting and we use
[01:41:37.480 --> 01:41:38.480]   a background.
[01:41:38.480 --> 01:41:40.680]   So you just turn on the camera and talk.
[01:41:40.680 --> 01:41:42.120]   Well, there's three cameras.
[01:41:42.120 --> 01:41:45.600]   It's actually turn on three cameras and talk and switch show off.
[01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:48.360]   But we also answer questions and go back and forth.
[01:41:48.360 --> 01:41:51.600]   And so it's really like an interactive conversation with our members.
[01:41:51.600 --> 01:41:55.000]   I want to go on record saying one camera is enough for anybody.
[01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.040]   Who needs three cameras?
[01:41:57.040 --> 01:41:58.040]   Right.
[01:41:58.040 --> 01:41:59.560]   Bob, Bob, Newhart did.
[01:41:59.560 --> 01:42:02.320]   So where do we go?
[01:42:02.320 --> 01:42:03.560]   Picsacore.com for that.
[01:42:03.560 --> 01:42:04.760]   You got Picsacore.com.
[01:42:04.760 --> 01:42:08.240]   There's you'll see a Picsacore live button and it doesn't do anything right now, but
[01:42:08.240 --> 01:42:09.240]   it will tomorrow.
[01:42:09.240 --> 01:42:12.560]   It will be at four o'clock Pacific standard.
[01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:14.960]   Please don't just keep pressing the button over and over.
[01:42:14.960 --> 01:42:15.960]   Yeah.
[01:42:15.960 --> 01:42:16.960]   Nothing's going to happen till four o'clock tomorrow.
[01:42:16.960 --> 01:42:17.960]   So check it out.
[01:42:17.960 --> 01:42:20.600]   I mean, I know it's overdone, but I think it's kind of cool looking.
[01:42:20.600 --> 01:42:21.600]   I think it's great.
[01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:22.600]   It's very cool.
[01:42:22.600 --> 01:42:24.520]   With HDR, there are two ways you can go.
[01:42:24.520 --> 01:42:27.760]   You can go colorful and arty or you can go absolutely natural.
[01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:29.440]   And I think both choices are natural.
[01:42:29.440 --> 01:42:30.720]   This was definitely not absent.
[01:42:30.720 --> 01:42:34.760]   In fact, I would go back and fix the sky, which Trace says everybody has to do.
[01:42:34.760 --> 01:42:35.760]   He said that was lazy.
[01:42:35.760 --> 01:42:38.080]   There's actually people in this.
[01:42:38.080 --> 01:42:39.080]   It's cool.
[01:42:39.080 --> 01:42:40.080]   It's very, I like the look.
[01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:41.080]   There's actually people there.
[01:42:41.080 --> 01:42:42.480]   It looks like a painting.
[01:42:42.480 --> 01:42:44.040]   It looks like I think you're right.
[01:42:44.040 --> 01:42:47.640]   Replace the replace the sky with like something flat or just paint in the new sky.
[01:42:47.640 --> 01:42:48.640]   Yeah.
[01:42:48.640 --> 01:42:50.120]   I'm a very, very pretty thing to hang on your kitchen.
[01:42:50.120 --> 01:42:52.720]   I know it's a nice where it fails because it's a little bit.
[01:42:52.720 --> 01:42:53.720]   Where is this?
[01:42:53.720 --> 01:42:54.960]   This is where I dropped Abi out.
[01:42:54.960 --> 01:42:56.480]   This is where Abi goes to college.
[01:42:56.480 --> 01:42:57.480]   Wow.
[01:42:57.480 --> 01:42:58.480]   At great expense.
[01:42:58.480 --> 01:42:59.480]   In the secret garden.
[01:42:59.480 --> 01:43:00.840]   That's where your money goes.
[01:43:00.840 --> 01:43:03.280]   That's where I have that bumper sticker.
[01:43:03.280 --> 01:43:06.480]   My daughter and all my money go to college.
[01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:07.480]   Yeah.
[01:43:07.480 --> 01:43:09.280]   But it's beautiful.
[01:43:09.280 --> 01:43:10.360]   It's based, it was built.
[01:43:10.360 --> 01:43:14.600]   It's on the Hudson River Valley and it was a, the college was, campus was formed from
[01:43:14.600 --> 01:43:17.560]   two different, a large mansions.
[01:43:17.560 --> 01:43:21.240]   You know, this is where all the rich people, Vanderbilts and this is where FDR's house
[01:43:21.240 --> 01:43:22.240]   was.
[01:43:22.240 --> 01:43:26.360]   And so they donated two different estates to almost, almost 600 acres.
[01:43:26.360 --> 01:43:29.400]   And this is one of the gardens, the formal gardens from one of the estates that was donated
[01:43:29.400 --> 01:43:30.400]   to make the college campus.
[01:43:30.400 --> 01:43:32.320]   Would you like to go to college there?
[01:43:32.320 --> 01:43:33.320]   Yeah.
[01:43:33.320 --> 01:43:34.320]   I would.
[01:43:34.320 --> 01:43:38.840]   And in 1928, we could have tea.
[01:43:38.840 --> 01:43:39.840]   Thank you gentlemen.
[01:43:39.840 --> 01:43:40.840]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:43:40.840 --> 01:43:41.840]   We'll see you next time.
[01:43:41.840 --> 01:43:42.840]   Now get back to work.
[01:43:42.840 --> 01:43:43.840]   Great time is over.
[01:43:43.840 --> 01:43:50.840]   [Music]
[01:43:50.840 --> 01:43:57.840]   [Music]
[01:43:57.840 --> 01:44:00.420]   (upbeat music)
