[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:15.480]   in Los Angeles, Apple's in trouble in Germany and in the US.
[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.760]   In fact, there's a bill of foot that might keep Apple from installing apps on your iPhone,
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.760]   plus where you can get your official Ted Lasso merchandise and all the new shows coming up
[00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:27.760]   on Apple TV.
[00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.320]   Plus that and a whole lot more.
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.320]   Next on Mac Break Weekly.

[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.600]   I'm the Swiper now.

[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.600]   It's not complicated.

[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.360]   at no extra charge.
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:37.400]   At the time of Mac Break Weekly, the show we cover the latest Apple news weekly.
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.280]   That's why we call it Mac Break Weekly.
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.680]   Renee Richie is here from YouTube of YouTube fame.
[00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:43.680]   Hello Renee.
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.680]   Hello Leo.
[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.360]   It's so great to be back with all your friendly, familiar faces.
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.160]   Nice to see you.
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.320]   You know who else is back?
[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.160]   Mr. Alex Lindsey.
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.160]   Good to see you Alex.
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.760]   It's good to be here.
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:56.760]   Wow.
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.360]   Is that an 8K picture you're sending us these days?
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.360]   HDR.
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.200]   It is eye dynamic range.
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.200]   It's capable of high dynamic range, but no.
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:15.560]   Oh, 9/0.media and of course, office hours every day, all day.
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.120]   We'll talk about bottom office hours, how to join the office hours in a bit.
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.480]   Andy Naco also here from WGBH.
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.480]   Hello Andrew.
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.480]   Hello.
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.480]   Hello.
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.640]   So here we are gathered together with absolutely nothing to talk about, but that's okay.
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.800]   Those are the best shows.
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:34.800]   Those are the best shows.
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:35.800]   It's fine.
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.600]   No, again, that means we don't have to restrain ourselves.
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:44.360]   Like if there's a Hollywood movie that is filming literally across the street from one
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.560]   of us and they're kind of throwing their weight around and you're kind of annoyed even though
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.080]   you like two of the stars that are in it, we could talk about that as well.
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.920]   What is going on in your neighborhood that we should know about?
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.760]   What movie will do tell us?
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:05.200]   All I'm saying is that like I've said before, I live in a 300 year old New England like coastal
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.160]   community that's not that we're.
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.520]   So Stephen, can you move?
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.520]   Keep going.
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:15.160]   No, again, that is that is so damn quaint that if this if the establishing shot of this
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.560]   community were in like the first act of a movie, you know that the subtext would be there
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.920]   is something desperately wrong underneath the quaint facade of this dark, dark, New
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:25.920]   England mystical town.
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.920]   Stephen King's Gilmore Girls movie.
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.720]   A lot of getting from you so far.
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:30.720]   Right.
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:31.720]   Okay.
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.480]   So, so again, it's already almost to effing quaint, but now when they do like this, they
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.600]   start they're starting filming tomorrow today and yesterday.
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.920]   What did they do in the park right across the street?
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.640]   They decided they needed a damn gazebo there.
[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:44.640]   A gazebo.
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.440]   Well, every part of the gazebo.
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.440]   I've tried to have a gazebo.
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.960]   So who is in this?
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.560]   Who is in this movie that you.
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.160]   Tim Burton has to be Tim Burton.
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.160]   Kevin Bacon.
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.160]   Oh, nice.
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.640]   It's being directed by Kyra Sedgwick.
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.240]   You know, you know, you have to meet him because because then you enter the Kevin Bay six
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.480]   degrees of Kevin Bacon.
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.480]   Yeah.
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.400]   You if you meet Kevin Bacon, you become no more than three steps from everyone in one
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.400]   node.
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.400]   Yeah.
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.400]   You're one node.
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.960]   So here is your kasetich because it's Sedgwick because his wife.
[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.640]   So it's a husband wife team.
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:19.640]   Yep.
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:20.640]   I wonder if it's that show.
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:26.200]   There is a show TV show that he's in that is takes place in Boston.
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.960]   I wonder if it's a part of it.
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:28.960]   But you know, it's a.
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:29.960]   No, it is.
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:30.960]   It is a movie.
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:36.480]   We also I also found out that I I guess the tax advantages in this state are really, really
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:41.920]   good because there's a sequel to to Hocus Pocus and part of it is going to be filming
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.800]   like maybe 10 miles away from me.
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.280]   The curse of living in a quaint town.
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:47.840]   When I'm quite quite.
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.720]   Tell that that's desperate for Hollywood money.
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:50.720]   Yes.
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:51.720]   Yeah.
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.920]   Hey, speaking of that, I was saying that if that gazebo is in the dumpster after this
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.960]   is filming, I'm taking it and I'm nagging it from my living room.
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.480]   I think every town should have a gazebo in its park.
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:03.320]   I mean, come on, where you going to have the band playing the fourth of July.
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.320]   Pedal.
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.320]   You would you attract.
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:06.320]   You attract.
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.720]   You attract barbershop quartets and then what would we be?
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:10.720]   Sweet.
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:11.920]   A line.
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.560]   So you've heard that movie theaters have been closing.
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.640]   People are wondering what are we going to do with all these movie theaters?
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:24.120]   The most significant one, I think is the old Grumman Chinese theater, which there's
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.760]   also the Cinerama dome in LA.
[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:33.080]   But here is a beautiful theater the in Los Angeles, the tower theater.
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:39.800]   Look at this that is being turned into has been turned into an Apple store right next
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.000]   to the Rialto.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.200]   Look at that.
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.200]   Good on you, Apple.
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:48.760]   They preserve the the marquee sign.
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.240]   They have Apple's been apples done this in a couple places.
[00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.200]   There's right.
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:58.560]   And Coventry Gardens is a pretty gorgeous one in London as well as there's the one in downtown
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:59.560]   Paris is quite.
[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.320]   Look at this couple in New York.
[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:02.320]   Look at this.
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:07.800]   This is the this is the actual movie theater and it's the lobby, but they preserve the balcony
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.800]   put in parquet floors.
[00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.440]   I mean, this is great.
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:17.600]   This is just it's it's their 26 store in LA.
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.800]   So it's but I just think they've done a lovely job.
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:26.160]   So you know what I'm glad Apple somebody's preserving Hollywood's history.
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.320]   The tower theater money for good.
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:29.320]   Yeah.
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:30.320]   Yeah.
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.480]   That's why it was kind of disappointing that so Google opened their first like Apple rip
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:36.040]   off store like the first real one, not a pop up.
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:40.960]   And all they did was they just sort of like renovated a space that was vacated by a Starbucks
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.760]   in the transportation building that is like already Google headquarters.
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:50.120]   So I'm not saying they're under an obligation, but this is an opportunity to rescue and rehab
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:55.360]   a building that's hundred years old has lots of beauty, lots of natural significance.
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.760]   You would think that it's it's good PR.
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:02.400]   You're creating one of the great things about what Apple's doing and what Google could have
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:07.000]   done is that we're losing all these gorgeous public spaces.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.040]   If you go back to especially New England, you'll see like a post office that was built
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.580]   a hundred years ago.
[00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:15.760]   And you could tell the thing that the thinking was, well, look, this is going to be like the
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:17.800]   center of town activity.
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:21.960]   It should be a little bit like it should be a beautiful place to be the library like
[00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:24.000]   Boston Public Library, which we've talked about so much.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.360]   It should be like a cathedral for people to come and visit.
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:33.640]   And now like the post offices are just even the big ones are just like where you go to
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:37.880]   desperately beg a commissar for any information about your dissident uncle who disappeared
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:38.880]   last week.
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:41.200]   It's not a fun, interesting place to be.
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:45.760]   So I love Apple for preserving these spaces where they're not nudging people out.
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:49.280]   You just want to sit and charge your phone, sit and use the Wi-Fi for an hour to sit
[00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:50.280]   and take a class.
[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:53.640]   They don't check your receipts, but it's a beautiful place to be.
[00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:59.200]   It's also there's a resonance because of course this is one of the first theatres, I think
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:04.360]   the first theatre that talking pictures were shown.
[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:09.280]   That was the art form, the primary art form of the 20th century.
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:13.000]   And it's suffering a little bit, at least theatres are suffering a little bit in the
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.480]   21st century.
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:18.640]   So it's kind of appropriate that Apple would take this over.
[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:22.160]   Yeah, it says the Tower Theatre was the first theatre in Los Angeles wired for films with
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.960]   sound.
[00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:26.880]   Just they've really done a stunning job.
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:32.640]   But actually I think looks better than it did in the day day, to be honest with you.
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:35.000]   We have technological advantages now.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.680]   They restored the stained glass.
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:42.840]   They restored all of the Rococo plaster touches.
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:46.440]   They put new crystals on the chandeliers.
[00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:51.480]   This is, you know, here's what it's, I'm sure it's a money loser for Apple, although
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:55.960]   who knows they make more money per square foot than anybody but Tiffany on their stores.
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:59.880]   But I would imagine it's a, now it's a destination, isn't it?
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:06.440]   Well, it's a really good location for Apple being that it is only about a block from Persian
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:13.800]   Square, which is a lot of good hotels right there, as well as it's only probably, it's
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:17.680]   an easy walk to the convention center.
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:18.680]   So LA convention center.
[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:19.680]   I'll tell you what.
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:23.160]   I'll be next time I'm in LA, it's a definite must.
[00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:28.080]   I'd rather go there than, you know, the, the Hollywood walks, the stars.
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:30.760]   You have basically Staples Center, Microsoft theater.
[00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:31.760]   It's all in that area.
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:32.760]   Right down there.
[00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:35.960]   And a lot of us, a lot of us that do have done a lot of production there, always wish
[00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:37.200]   that there was an Apple store.
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:41.600]   It was close by because we usually need something that we need to grab from it and to have
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:44.320]   one that nice there is going to be, it's going to be great.
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:45.600]   Actually that's kind of a good point.
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:49.400]   Yeah, they met people, be running over to get their dongles.
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:50.400]   We've done it in San Francisco.
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:51.680]   We've done it all the time.
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:55.640]   The Apple store in San Francisco for a long time was one block from Muscony and now it's,
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:57.680]   you know, three blocks from Musco.
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:00.880]   And there's just constant trips back and forth during the, during conventions.
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:03.800]   Anyway, that's, that's our top story.
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:06.920]   But I think a good, I think actually a great story.
[00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:07.920]   Thanks folks.
[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:08.920]   Yeah.
[00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:09.920]   We'll see you all later.
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:12.760]   Overall, I think that, it's the week for overall, overall around the world, Apple
[00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:17.160]   has, has done a lot of these that are very avant-garde or they're taking historical locations
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:21.720]   and really pushing them as, as Renee mentioned in, you know, in the,
[00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:26.560]   I think that, you know, I'm going to be in Singapore in January.
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:31.840]   I want to see that Singapore in the, in the harbor there, a store, Grand Central Station.
[00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:33.840]   Although, oh, Grand Central is amazing.
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:34.840]   It's like a bazaar.
[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:35.840]   It's like they have everything spread out every night.
[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:36.840]   They have to bring it back in every night.
[00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:38.320]   They pack out every day.
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:39.600]   It's like, it's amazing.
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:44.080]   But this is a little different because they're, instead of building their own kind of sui
[00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:50.200]   generous, amazing architecture or putting a store in an existing place like Grand Central,
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:55.240]   they're taking a theater and really recreating it.
[00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:56.800]   And I think that that's really interesting.
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.480]   I hope they do more of this.
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:10:59.480]   Yeah.
[00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:00.480]   Really, really great.
[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:01.480]   Exactly.
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:02.480]   Exactly.
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:03.480]   Exactly.
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:07.920]   Like Alex said, I mean, the, the, the first Apple store in Europe was another one of these
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:14.600]   reclaimed, reclaimed buildings on one of the main high streets in the middle of London,
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:19.280]   which probably would have been turned into a bank or something really, really boring.
[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:23.200]   There is, again, you go walk through any city that's 100 years old.
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:30.520]   You can see amazing buildings that are just gorgeous, but like the opera house in, in Boston,
[00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:36.120]   the Paramount Theater in Boston, these were like abandoned sort of in the 80s, 1980s, early
[00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:38.640]   90s, and the roof eventually caved in.
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.360]   It was almost a total loss.
[00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:43.840]   You really needed it would have been a damn shame if these things have been pulled down
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:49.900]   because they were built 100, 150 years ago when these buildings were designed to be palaces
[00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:50.900]   for the public.
[00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:55.440]   And it's this, this is such good will from Apple to say that we will make, if everyone
[00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:59.560]   who walks through the city, even if you never stop in the store, you'll walk around this
[00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:04.200]   brilliantly cleaned and restored facade and it will make your town more cool than it would
[00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:07.000]   have been again, if it'd become another Santaander bank.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.720]   And what's interesting is it's not gaudy in the sense that it always seems to fit in.
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:14.440]   Like if you go to Shady sidepence, Shady side Pittsburgh, it's just the Apple store just
[00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:15.440]   fits in.
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:18.000]   It's not like standing out and just like it's part of what makes sense there.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.600]   But you go to the, I know that went to the Paris Apple store and just stunning.
[00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:24.320]   This is the same thing.
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:25.320]   It's the same thing.
[00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:26.320]   Yeah.
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:27.320]   Yeah.
[00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:28.320]   Yeah.
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:29.320]   Just unbelievable when you walk through it.
[00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:32.520]   So I think this also reflects, we've talked about this before, Alex, you and I have talked
[00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:35.360]   about it, the future of retail.
[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:38.760]   You know, brick and mortar suffering and it's prime day today.
[00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:42.240]   And you know, I think a lot of people are shopping online.
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:48.120]   By the way, prime day now is not just Amazon and Walmart's got its deal days, target.
[00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:51.720]   Everybody's doing it the same two days in June.
[00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:56.560]   I think that retail stores now have to be an experience as much as a place to go buy
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:57.560]   stuff.
[00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:59.560]   Yeah, I absolutely agree.
[00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:02.160]   And I think that we'll see Apple continue to push more of it.
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:04.960]   One of the things that Apple does really well is all the support that you get when you're
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:05.960]   there.
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:10.040]   So a lot of what draws a lot of people through the Apple store is the fact that that's where
[00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:13.960]   you go to see an Apple genius about something that's not working or that's how you work
[00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:15.560]   through some of those issues.
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:17.120]   And also there's a lot of things.
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:21.080]   My kids go to it all the time because that's how they learn how to use GarageBand.
[00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:23.920]   And that's how they learned how to do things with Zach King.
[00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:28.360]   You know, so a lot of the free classes that Apple had been providing pre-COVID and probably
[00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:31.680]   go back too soon, you know, drew a lot of people in.
[00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:35.480]   So there was kids learning how to do stuff and adults learning how to do things with
[00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:42.200]   their iPads and things with their computers and their phones as well as tons of support
[00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:43.200]   that's going on there.
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:47.600]   And I think I will be surprised if we don't see a lot of AR activations at some point
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:49.680]   inside the stores where you can kind of--
[00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:50.680]   That would be interesting.
[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:56.040]   Yeah, I think that it's an easy place for Apple to safely build an AR experience for
[00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:57.040]   people.
[00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:58.280]   So I think that you're going to probably see a lot more of that.
[00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:03.520]   And to your point, you know, providing more than just retail is what Apple's doing.
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:08.600]   They're providing a physical representation of themselves for people who are buying their
[00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:09.600]   stuff from everywhere.
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:13.400]   This is the Covent Garden store that you were talking about in London.
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.160]   That's great.
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:23.560]   I think somebody in the chatroom, Web4373 said that movie theaters were originally designated,
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:29.800]   especially the Tower Theatre, if you look at it as a palaces for the public.
[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:32.600]   And he says, "I'm worried now because they're palaces to commercialism."
[00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:34.600]   I don't know if this is--
[00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:36.720]   This is not about commercialism as much.
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:41.680]   I mean, it is commercial, but I think it's also a statement about what Apple's culture
[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:42.680]   is.
[00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:44.520]   And that is a good point.
[00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:50.240]   However, at this point, you have to ask yourself, would you rather it be a palace to commercialism
[00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:55.200]   that, again, is completely restored and also available for the public to simply enter whenever
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:59.040]   they want and make whatever-- excuse me-- limited whatever use of they want?
[00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:03.640]   Or would you rather it become either torn down and turned into a high-rise building to
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:09.600]   put-- to make most profit off of that real estate or turned into a private business where
[00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:13.560]   you have to have a passkey in order to get in and you don't even really much care what
[00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:14.560]   it looks like on the outside?
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:16.160]   You have to take what you can get, unfortunately.
[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:18.080]   Apple does encourage people to gather there.
[00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:21.960]   I know the New San Francisco store has a garden, basically.
[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:24.440]   They want you to come and eat lunch and hang out.
[00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:25.440]   Right.
[00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:26.440]   The community center is.
[00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:27.440]   Yeah.
[00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:31.000]   I think this is great, honestly.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.480]   Yeah.
[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:40.120]   You know, this is-- I don't think the city of LA is going to preserve this historic monument.
[00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:42.960]   I'm glad that Apple would.
[00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:46.080]   We were talking before the show about the Queen Mary in Long Beach, which has gotten
[00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:51.880]   so rundown, it's about to sink because the city of Long Beach refuses to do anything
[00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:52.880]   about it.
[00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:56.640]   I think they might take over and save it, I don't know.
[00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:59.960]   Drives a lot of traffic.
[00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:00.960]   That's the good news.
[00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:01.960]   Now the bad news.
[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:08.400]   Apple facing more antitrust activity this time in Germany, the Federal Cartel Office,
[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:12.800]   initiated proceedings against Apple, claims of anti-competitive behavior related to the
[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:16.280]   app store, its products, and other services.
[00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:19.520]   I would read you the press release, but my German isn't very good.
[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:22.520]   Thank you, back rumors for translating.
[00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:27.280]   If you will now examine, VESA, it's pro-parai-tai-ap-a-lating.
[00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:28.640]   I'm not going to really like that.
[00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:32.760]   Operating system iOS, Apple has created a digital ecosystem where it's iPhone that extends
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:34.120]   across several markets.
[00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:35.120]   Yes.
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:40.160]   Apple produces tablets, computers, and wearables, provides a host of device-related services.
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:45.520]   In addition to manufacturing various hardware products, the tech company also offers App Store
[00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:50.640]   iCloud Apple Care, Apple Music, Apple Arcade, Apple TV Plus, as well as other services.
[00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:54.760]   The main focus of the investigations will be on the operation of the App Store as it enables
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:17:01.560]   Apple in many ways to influence the business activities of third parties.
[00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:06.080]   They're concerned about integration across several markets, the magnitude of its technological
[00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:11.440]   and financial resources, and its access to data.
[00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:13.800]   It's an investigation.
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:16.080]   These things take time.
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:21.240]   Yes, but they're fighting battles on so many fronts right now.
[00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:25.960]   I believe that they've probably at this point put more money into their legal department
[00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:28.240]   than they do in R&D at some point.
[00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:32.200]   How can they deal with all of these approaches everywhere?
[00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:35.440]   They've put a lot of money into R&D.
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:37.280]   It's a big number.
[00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:40.040]   I'm joking.
[00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:46.080]   This is something where if they don't attack this aggressively and in every court in the
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:51.800]   entire planet, they are going to have a lot of their, too much of their work is going
[00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:57.240]   to be spent just dealing with regulations and localizing not only their products but
[00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:58.920]   also their business operations.
[00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:04.800]   There's a, Russia just passed, just passed through the Russian legislature saying that
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:10.240]   a company as big as Apple has to have local office or locally incorporated company inside
[00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:15.640]   Russia to allow to be, to conduct business, strictly to make sure that they will be forced
[00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:20.920]   to comply with every Russian law and regulation that they intend to put forward in the future.
[00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:23.160]   You can't just simply say, "Oh, well, it's not a Russia-based company.
[00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:25.160]   You can't touch us."
[00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:31.080]   So now that we're talking about creating an entire bureaucracy and making sure that you
[00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:35.720]   are essentially doing whatever you have to do in order to keep inside these markets.
[00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:38.280]   This is not what they were doing when they were two hippies in a garage.
[00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:43.000]   This is not what they're doing when they were a humble $2 trillion company a few years
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.440]   ago that was not facing a whole lot of regulation.
[00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:49.320]   I don't think this has anything to do with business.
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:50.320]   What I'd say, right?
[00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:54.440]   I think this is one of the things that calls is every time these German investigations
[00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:59.600]   or EU investigations, particularly, they're often stimulated by complaints from competitors.
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:04.240]   In this case, Axel Springer, the German publisher, and Facebook.
[00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:08.240]   I guess that's how it works, but that's disappointing.
[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:12.400]   I think a lot of this comes down to intelligence.
[00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:15.240]   I think all of these things are getting pushed by the intelligence agencies.
[00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:16.880]   Oh, they're having the...
[00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:18.800]   This is all about people's privacy.
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:23.520]   Let's make sure that we're clear that these laws are not being generated by businesses.
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:27.640]   They're being generated by the intelligence communities are pushing this forward.
[00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:30.160]   The thing is that they're pushing it through their representatives.
[00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:33.480]   They're pushing it through those things, but what they want is into the phone.
[00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:35.720]   We can talk about Apple leaking stuff.
[00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:37.680]   That's why Apple draws one line.
[00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:39.480]   They don't draw lines across all your metadata.
[00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:41.680]   They don't draw lines across your iCloud.
[00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:45.520]   They give that over whenever it's asked for, but they won't let people into the phone and
[00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:47.400]   it's making them crazy.
[00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:50.560]   The thing is that what they want to do is figure out a way to break that up so that they
[00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:52.120]   can get in.
[00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:58.240]   Once this integrated solution gets broken up, it basically creates cracks for the NSA.
[00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:03.000]   It creates cracks for the five eyes.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.120]   The thing is that what we have to realize is that's what's happening here.
[00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:08.200]   It isn't about the business stuff.
[00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:09.360]   They're using the business stuff that they can use.
[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:10.360]   Well, I'd say it's one of the things.
[00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:13.440]   I think there are other reasons people are doing this.
[00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:15.520]   There's a lot of push coming from you.
[00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:17.760]   I'm sure that's the case.
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:21.400]   The reason Russia wants an office for all these companies in Russia is so there's somebody
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:22.400]   to arrest.
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:27.520]   Russia and China are much more overt about what they want, but we're still doing it.
[00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:31.120]   People need to realize that their government is not doing them a favor.
[00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:35.400]   Australia is part of the five eyes.
[00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:41.360]   Again, Russia managed to get Apple to change their installer, create a custom homegrown
[00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:46.120]   installer just to make sure that they could give exposure to whatever apps Russia government
[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:50.800]   wants to a user to actually take a look at, which means that they're probably just ones.
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:55.040]   They're really not that far behind ordering, by the way, this is a mandatory app that you're
[00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:57.200]   going to have to push out to everybody.
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:00.440]   We've already done this in the United States with certain COVID tracking apps.
[00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:05.320]   Massachusetts got into a little bit of trouble because they were pushing out a module of
[00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:10.040]   their COVID tracker to people who got it installed, whether they wanted it or not.
[00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:13.440]   These are the sort of things that any company the size of Apple is going to have to deal
[00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:18.560]   with on a country by country and unless federal legislation goes through on a state by state
[00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:20.760]   basis in the United States, it's chaos.
[00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:25.920]   Well, in fact, Congress, one of the five, we talked about this on Sunday, one of the five
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:32.600]   antitrust bills Congress will be voting on is one that says Apple cannot pre-install
[00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:34.040]   apps on the iPhone.
[00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:38.280]   This was, was it David Sisselini?
[00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:39.280]   I think it was.
[00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:40.280]   I think that was Rhode Island.
[00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:41.280]   Yeah.
[00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:43.000]   I think they got corrected that Apple can't.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.760]   I believe that that was corrected somewhere else that they corrected and said, well, Apple
[00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:49.840]   can't not let you delete them.
[00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:55.920]   Bloomberg had a quote directly from Chichelini who said explicitly that Apple cannot force
[00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:59.760]   people to have Apple apps on their device and they can be removed.
[00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:06.600]   The wording of the actual legislation itself is not precise enough to preclude Apple being
[00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:10.360]   prevented from pre-installing apps, but that is different from the Bloomberg.
[00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:14.960]   Just to point out that Bloomberg originally had the headline that, hey, Chichelini says
[00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:18.320]   that Apple is not going to be able to pre-install apps on phones.
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:24.200]   They walked that back after taking a look at the transcript or whatever again.
[00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:26.400]   But the text of the law is still vague enough.
[00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:27.400]   It's still being discussed.
[00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:33.120]   It's still going to be debated tomorrow, I think, in Congress, rather the correct subcommittee.
[00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:35.120]   So the wording will probably be tightened up.
[00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:36.120]   Yeah.
[00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:38.560]   There's a long way to go between this is an actual law of the land.
[00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:40.320]   This is the House of Representatives.
[00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:44.480]   It then has to get a Senate bill has to get through and then, of course, they have to
[00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:46.280]   do reconciliation.
[00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:53.400]   The initial reaction of a lot of people was that it's unlikely any of these will get
[00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:57.680]   through except maybe Elizabeth Warren's bill, which has already passed the Senate, which
[00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:02.160]   just increases merger fees so they can do better regulation of it.
[00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:07.400]   Alex Cantrowitz, who was on Twitter on Sunday, is pretty knowledgeable and this stuff runs
[00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:14.720]   the big technology newsletter and podcast, said he's actually changed his tune a little
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:15.720]   bit.
[00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:21.160]   He thinks it might, just because you've got Republicans and Democrats aligned on this,
[00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:23.200]   that might actually get through.
[00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:26.800]   So it is possible these will in some form or fashion.
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:27.800]   I mean, law.
[00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:32.720]   The thing that should scare us is that right now, those laws are very general and they
[00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:36.840]   create a bureau, which basically just means that it basically lets the government do whatever
[00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:37.840]   it wants.
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:44.680]   Like by creating a loose set of laws and a bureau without them being precise, right
[00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:48.360]   now, if you look through those acts, they just basically let the government do almost
[00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:50.280]   anything it wants to these companies.
[00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:56.200]   And so the thing is that that is, in their current state, which they won't be, but in
[00:23:56.200 --> 00:24:02.680]   their current state, Mac, Apple users should consider this an existential threat to their
[00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:07.480]   way of life because they can do anything they want with a bureau.
[00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:14.040]   So at this point, I'm speaking only based on my understanding and the people that have
[00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:15.240]   been talking to about this.
[00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:17.600]   I'm not convinced that that's the case.
[00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:23.960]   However, there is a couple of one of the specific laws, FTC has the power to not only impose
[00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:28.200]   penalties, but also to on an ongoing basis, decide where the penalties are going to be,
[00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:34.000]   and also to create brand new regulations as they see fit to make sure that they're enforcing
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   the standards of the antitrust provisions of these laws.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   So yeah, you're right.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   It's open that way.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.280]   I'm not sure that I'm not saying you're wrong.
[00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:48.440]   I'm saying that at this point, I haven't been convinced that it really is an open checkbook.
[00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:52.040]   I think that what's going to happen is that all of these companies are going to decide
[00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:57.480]   that it's time to start negotiating with Congress to decide, well, if there's going to be a
[00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:02.440]   federal law about this, we can at least have some influence, kaching, kaching, kaching,
[00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:05.600]   upon exactly what we're required to do.
[00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:10.960]   And if it can make all these 27 different state legislatures put away these anti-trust,
[00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:15.720]   excuse me, these individual laws that control their behavior and what they can do, then that's
[00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:18.000]   all to the good for them.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.840]   Okay.
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:22.040]   Canada is also trying some regulations.
[00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:27.480]   There's a new law that could require Apple TV plus to finance and promote Canadian content.
[00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:33.560]   Historically, the CRTC in Canada has had a Canadian content regulation that requires
[00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:35.400]   a certain percentage of Canadian content.
[00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:40.320]   I'm aware of it because when we went to do it for help in Canada, I was the only American
[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:41.560]   allowed to work on the show.
[00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:47.040]   Otherwise, if people aren't familiar, the CRTC is like the FTC, but works for the industry,
[00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:48.520]   not for the citizens.
[00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:50.920]   It's basically how I would describe it.
[00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:54.860]   According to Bloomberg, again, Canadian lawmakers passed a controversial bill that aims to
[00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:59.000]   regulate programming distributed by media streaming services.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:05.140]   Bill C-10 is meant to subject tech giants to the same Canadian content requirements as
[00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:07.600]   traditional broadcasters.
[00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:10.760]   So Netflix, TikTok and others who have Canadian content.
[00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:13.680]   Like YouTube creators, TikTokers, they didn't scale it.
[00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:17.240]   Originally, the first version said that it didn't apply to individual content creators.
[00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:20.220]   They're like, "Oh, we'll just cross out that passage."
[00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:22.940]   And now everyone's just looking around going, "I don't understand what this is."
[00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:24.780]   This is your big chance, Renee.
[00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:27.320]   Your Canadian content gets some of that.
[00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:29.840]   Half the stuff on American television is Canadian content.
[00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:33.240]   The entire CW network is Canadian, because it's all filmed in Vancouver and Toronto.
[00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:34.640]   What do they want from us?
[00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:35.640]   It's so stupid.
[00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:38.960]   Well, I'm glad you're saying that as a Canadian.
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:41.480]   I think it's consistent with what they're doing.
[00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:45.680]   I mean, I wouldn't necessarily disagree with, I think it's kind of funny that they do it.
[00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:51.080]   But I understand for some of the, I know I'm taking an opposite thing with this one, but
[00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:58.340]   I actually think that there is something that countries have to figure out as far as protecting
[00:26:58.340 --> 00:27:02.700]   their own culture from the United States.
[00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:07.540]   Like I will say that if you're going into that market, I think that they're, I mean,
[00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:11.980]   I work in Africa and what you basically see is cultural clear-cutting.
[00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:16.060]   It's just because all there is is American footage and it's almost impossible to get
[00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:20.700]   people get your word out of your an African filmmaker unless you're in Nigeria.
[00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:24.000]   So it's basically American and Nigerian content.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:29.200]   And so I understand some of the sensitivities to just getting run over where you don't
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:32.440]   see anything from your own country because it's all coming out of the United States.
[00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:34.120]   Yeah, I think that's fair.
[00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:35.120]   Yeah.
[00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:39.520]   So I'm not, I think that it, whether we decide whether they should force these companies,
[00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:41.640]   the reality is they're not watching broadcast anymore.
[00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:44.240]   And 10 years no one's going to be watching broadcast and all of the content is going
[00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:45.720]   to come out of the extremely services.
[00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:50.040]   So it may make sense to figure out how to get ahead of that in that case.
[00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:51.520]   It still has to pass the Senate.
[00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:56.000]   You know, that's a long shot because elections coming up and so forth.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:00.060]   According to Bloomberg, the bill would effectively add three requirements for digital media companies.
[00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:05.940]   They have to provide information about their revenue sources in effect demonstrate whether
[00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:08.300]   it's Canadian content.
[00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:13.280]   They should give a portion of their profits to a fund to support Canadian content and
[00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:17.320]   increase the visibility or discoverability of Canadian content.
[00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:22.000]   It's a little maple leaf flag in all of Renee Richie's videos would, I think, do the job
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   nicely.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   And then, so I'm so sorry.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.240]   You can be easy to worry about this.
[00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:26.240]   They just make good programs.
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:27.240]   Yeah.
[00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:30.400]   Like they just make Sherlock and they make Doctor Who and everybody wants to watch those.
[00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:32.320]   You know, in Canada, make some good programming too.
[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:33.840]   It gets shown in the US.
[00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:38.240]   You know, Alex's point is well taken because not everybody can afford or have the reach
[00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:41.280]   or have the history to promote local content.
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:44.520]   So there should always be some affordance to local content and it should be supported.
[00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:48.000]   And I say this as a giant Canadian where our government supports everything.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   But it just, it seems like a surrender in some ways for Canada to do this because we
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.640]   are, we just have such a tradition of media.
[00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:58.920]   It's like whenever we say, oh, the Olympics have come to Toronto, it's finally shows Toronto
[00:28:58.920 --> 00:28:59.920]   as a world-class city.
[00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:03.720]   And we're like, this 2020, if you don't think Toronto's a world-class city by now, what
[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:06.400]   have you been doing with the last 200 years of confederation?
[00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:08.080]   Why do we have such an inferiority complex?
[00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:11.080]   But I also think that the world's standing on the world stage.
[00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:14.080]   I also think that the United States had an inferiority complex.
[00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:16.120]   It's so annoying.
[00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:17.120]   They're all sorry.
[00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:18.120]   We're all sorry.
[00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:23.880]   I have a friend that's constantly telling me, eventually we're going to come down there
[00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:26.280]   and take over the United States, then you'll all be sorry.
[00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:28.280]   So, good line.
[00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:29.800]   That's a good way.
[00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:34.640]   So, but I think that part of the reason that there's so much great content coming out of
[00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:36.360]   Canada is all these funding sources.
[00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:41.200]   You know, is that the requirements and broadcast that have required it have meant that there's
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:44.200]   business for folks to do that kind of work.
[00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:47.000]   And that's part of the process.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.200]   Let's take a little break.
[00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:49.200]   More to come.
[00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:50.200]   Alex Lindsey's here.
[00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:52.480]   Office hours are there.
[00:29:52.480 --> 00:30:02.440]   Find out more by following him on Twitter, A-L-E-X-L-I-N-D-S-A-Y or go to youtube.com/officehours.
[00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:08.480]   The reach and scope of office hours has been as dramatic.
[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:11.960]   What are you talking about these days?
[00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:13.280]   I'm right alarming.
[00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:14.760]   Alarming to me.
[00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:15.760]   Dramatic to others.
[00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:16.760]   Yes.
[00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:17.760]   What are you doing?
[00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:20.680]   We talk about, I mean, it's really just media production in general, but it covers a pretty
[00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:21.680]   wide gamut.
[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:26.320]   So, we're talking about everything from Unreal Engine to audio.
[00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:30.560]   Really, today we had long discussions about different kinds of microphones and pipelines
[00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:34.840]   and so on and so forth, but also grappling with even teachers that are talking about
[00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:38.680]   how to use media in the classroom and how to kind of look at the next generation of
[00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:41.560]   classrooms, AWS video production.
[00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:43.920]   It really covers pretty much everything around it.
[00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:47.600]   And that's part of what makes it so interesting is that we're not, it's not like you go there
[00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:52.760]   and it's just a bunch of audio people or video people or CG people.
[00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:55.320]   It is people interested in media in general.
[00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:56.600]   And you can just listen.
[00:30:56.600 --> 00:31:02.280]   We had someone come into this morning and she's from Adelaide, Australia and she studies
[00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:06.680]   the health ramifications of space flight.
[00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:07.680]   Wow.
[00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:11.480]   And she's like, I started watching you because I don't understand all of the stuff yet.
[00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:15.280]   And I was like, yeah, but it'll be yet and we don't understand what you do on there.
[00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:20.200]   This is really, this is for people who auto-didex, people who just have a really broad range
[00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:21.200]   of interests.
[00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:24.200]   On Tuesday, you focused on orchestral mic placement.
[00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:25.200]   Oh my gosh.
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:26.200]   And it was really deep.
[00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:32.200]   Yeah, it got to be a very, very deep conversation about how orchestras are recorded and why.
[00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:35.840]   Well, we were talking about that in regards to spatial audio.
[00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:40.120]   You said, and I don't know, do you now feel the same way, that you don't get as much spatial
[00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:43.720]   audio because of the way micro orchestras are waked.
[00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:45.240]   I still feel like it's just different.
[00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:50.480]   And there's still, what was interesting about that hour is it really challenged a lot of
[00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:54.360]   things where you just, they were explaining why and the fact that each group is paying
[00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:59.160]   attention to the ones next to them as well as the conductor and how that interplay works
[00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:02.600]   and why it's hard to break that all apart.
[00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:05.960]   And so there was a bunch of just, a really deep discussion about that.
[00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:09.600]   And it's not a discussion that I lead, it's a discussion that I kind of ride along with.
[00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:14.720]   So like tomorrow we have, there's someone who makes a thing for the ATEM.
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:19.680]   So it switches from that to tomorrow, MixFX Pro, the company that makes this kind of
[00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:22.920]   controller for the ATEM software is going to come in, the developer is going to come in
[00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:25.240]   and talk about it and answer people's questions.
[00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:26.240]   I like this guy.
[00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:31.360]   It was on today, ruthless audio review, Greg Curtis from Norway.
[00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:34.800]   I don't know who he is, but I like how he looks.
[00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:40.040]   Greg, Greg has, he's got 40 years of Foley experiences.
[00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:41.440]   Oh, Foley are.
[00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:43.280]   Oh, that's awesome.
[00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:45.680]   But he lives in Norway teaching there.
[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:50.640]   But so when you get into like recordings, he was, he was talking today, he was like,
[00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:54.760]   oh, by the way, back in with Little House in the Prairie, that we, there was right next
[00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:55.760]   to a highway.
[00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:59.640]   And so we had to add all the time back in, you know, like, like, you know, these little
[00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:01.040]   stories that they show up.
[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:02.040]   Yeah.
[00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:03.040]   That job, boy.
[00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:04.040]   Brr, brr, brr.
[00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:05.040]   Yeah.
[00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:06.040]   Wow.
[00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:10.400]   So anyway, so you get it's, it's, and there's a lot of folks that have, you know, the, there's
[00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:13.920]   a lot of folks that are really deep into the industry that are, that are there just sharing
[00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:14.920]   what they know.
[00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:19.200]   I love, I love, I could, I could spend hours listening to somebody talk about Foley.
[00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:21.080]   He's just fascinating to me.
[00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:24.000]   Anyway, office hours dot global.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:29.760]   Your website now has a clips from shows and gives you a good idea of what you could expect
[00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:34.440]   from office hours, including Andy and a co, which is awesome and Ellen Fitt.
[00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:35.440]   Oh, wow.
[00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:36.440]   Look at that.
[00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:37.440]   Yeah.
[00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:38.440]   Lots of great stuff.
[00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:43.040]   I, I, I, I for one, support and encourage our new office hours over the Lord.
[00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:48.200]   As a tech content, I can help you.
[00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:49.640]   They are taking over.
[00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:51.920]   Basically it's a pretty soon Canadian content.
[00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:54.000]   Hell, what's your office hours content?
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   That's what we care.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.680]   They're on air less than more than they're off air now.
[00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:57.680]   It's amazing.
[00:33:57.680 --> 00:33:58.680]   It's crazy.
[00:33:58.680 --> 00:33:59.680]   It's great.
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:02.040]   It starts in the morning, continues often throughout the day.
[00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:03.040]   Yeah.
[00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:05.520]   There's two hours on the on air and then, but it starts two hours before that and goes
[00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:06.720]   another hour or two after that.
[00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:07.720]   So it's nice.
[00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:08.720]   It's funny.
[00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:11.360]   We're moving to 24 seven and probably later the summer.
[00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:12.360]   Oh, 26 seven.
[00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:13.360]   That's really interesting.
[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:14.360]   Wow.
[00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:16.520]   It'll be slow content for most of the time.
[00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:21.080]   So what happened is people during the WWDC streams that we had in the evening, what
[00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:24.000]   happened was people were staying on to our post show until the other one started.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   Right.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.440]   And then they wanted to stay on after that for another couple hours and we realized we're
[00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:29.160]   only like four or five hours left.
[00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:31.280]   So, so we might as well just leave it open.
[00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:32.960]   And so we're working on that process.
[00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:33.960]   See what happens.
[00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:36.400]   People can just kind of let people come in and out and talk.
[00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:37.400]   Yeah.
[00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:39.000]   The office hours abide.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:44.280]   It's really it's really a reflection of what's happened during the pandemic and everybody's
[00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:49.720]   ability to zoom and tolerance now of zoom zoom zoom is the new broadcasting really.
[00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:53.760]   But I would say that part of it is that makes us we had ruthless reviews today about our
[00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:55.760]   microphones and on on Thursday.
[00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:57.080]   That's our videos.
[00:34:57.080 --> 00:35:00.600]   So our audio and but we really tweak like, Oh, there's a little.
[00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:02.280]   Are you rolling off at 120?
[00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:04.280]   Can we pull that back a little bit?
[00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:08.840]   Like literally it's these are these are like audio folks like really digging in and then
[00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:14.520]   Thursday will do the same thing with video and part of I think why it's so easy to listen
[00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:20.320]   to it or watch it is because the audio quality is so high that the panelists have played
[00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:21.320]   play really hard.
[00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:23.480]   So they it looks really good and sounds good.
[00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:29.720]   Never had a worse experience in my life than doing something for NPR and the difficulty
[00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:32.760]   in getting the audio right.
[00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:34.520]   They were very, very picky more.
[00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:35.760]   I thought I was picky.
[00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:37.480]   They were really picky.
[00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:44.840]   Speaking of NPR, Boston public radio zone and a taco on WGBH in Boston every week, Thursdays,
[00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:49.320]   Fridays, what is the usually Fridays today's this week is Fridays at one.
[00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:53.160]   I just found out that there's a good chance that we're going to be back in our studios
[00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:56.360]   and the Boston public library at the end of July.
[00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:57.800]   So fingers crossed on that.
[00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:01.200]   You can get get yourself a piece of cake yourself a cup of coffee.
[00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:04.800]   You'll be paying for both because it's not our cafe, but it's a joining to the studio.
[00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:09.360]   You can watch me like read read my notes as though I'm calling them from memory.
[00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:13.480]   We fantasize when we opened the brick house because there was a restaurant next door about
[00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:17.800]   buying the whole building and turning it into a twit cafe next door so people could come
[00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:21.120]   get a get a get a nosh and then come into the main studio.
[00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:22.560]   I had many fantasies.
[00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:31.360]   Now I'm letting Alex fantasize for me also also Rene Richie who lives on the tube YouTube
[00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:37.560]   that is he's Canadian content at YouTube.com/Rene Richie.
[00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:39.040]   Truth.
[00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:45.480]   Our show today brought to you by A T and T active armor.
[00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:48.200]   Man, we rely so much on our phones these days.
[00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:54.240]   We're always on them, whether it's office hours watching maybe live streaming content
[00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:57.040]   or video calls with the family every week.
[00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:00.360]   I do that watching your favorite podcast.
[00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:03.160]   Perhaps there's no room for fraud calls.
[00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:07.640]   I mean, that's the worst thing when you get the phone ring in the middle of something
[00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:10.480]   that's all about your car warranty expiring.
[00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:12.600]   I don't even have a car warranty.
[00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:17.080]   That's got the point where I almost don't want to answer the phone.
[00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:23.160]   Thankfully, A T and T makes customer security a priority and helps block those pesky calls.
[00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:24.560]   It's not complicated.

[00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:45.760]   Thank you, A T and T for supporting Mac break weekly.
[00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:49.160]   Ben Lovejoy writing in nine to five Mac today.
[00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:53.520]   I didn't expect to like spatial audio, but I'm a convert.
[00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:55.880]   I kind of agree.
[00:37:55.880 --> 00:38:02.040]   Have you all now tried the new Apple music spatial audio and lossless?
[00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:04.080]   What do you think, Andy?
[00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:05.160]   It's nice.
[00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:06.160]   It's nice.
[00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:11.120]   I mean, my mind isn't blown, but then again, I don't have like, I don't have really, really
[00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:15.200]   super good speakers or super speaker setup or super good headphones.
[00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:17.600]   I do like the way that the music has been mixed.
[00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:20.080]   A lot of this has been our brand new mixes.
[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:21.960]   So that might be part of it.
[00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:23.640]   I don't think it's worthless.
[00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:28.680]   I just it's not like the first time we went from like black and white Mac screens to color
[00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:29.680]   Mac screens.
[00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:30.680]   It's not that big for me.
[00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:35.920]   Is it though, maybe the difference between mono and stereo?
[00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:37.160]   Is it like the next?
[00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:39.040]   That's what I'm wondering if it's the next step.
[00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:40.520]   That's kind of what you've been saying.
[00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:42.560]   Half the artist didn't mix it right.
[00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:45.080]   Like half the artist cared really deeply about making it stereo.
[00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:47.480]   They're like, okay, here's the text box.
[00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:49.480]   Like the Beatles.
[00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:50.480]   Right.
[00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:53.360]   I have actually upgraded.
[00:38:53.360 --> 00:39:00.840]   So you may remember my saka, which was I went out and bought AirPods Max, AirPods
[00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:06.280]   Max over the headphones to hear this, but I was kind of unhappy with the quality of the
[00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:07.280]   audio quality.
[00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:11.200]   That was because they're Bluetooth, but I was very happy to hear that spatial audio did
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:16.000]   work on my other headphones and I have good quality headphones from both Sennheiser and
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.080]   High-Fi man.
[00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:22.760]   And they really, I have to say it's a subtle difference, but if I'm given the choice between
[00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:26.200]   stereo and spatial, I will listen in spatial.
[00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:30.120]   And now I've got to the point where I didn't realize this, but you actually have to have
[00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:35.720]   and this kind of annoyed me, I have a 5-1 surround sound system in the living room for
[00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:41.000]   watching surround movies, but that doesn't, spatial audio doesn't go spatial on that unless
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.320]   you have an atmos decoding AV receiver.
[00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:48.800]   So I actually had to upgrade my AV receiver, I've ordered an atmos.
[00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:54.120]   Oh, I think a dent on 1600 is, you know, it's a decent atmos, but the whole idea I gather
[00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:59.920]   now is, I think we talked about this last week, that the decoding is actually happening
[00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:01.480]   as part of Dolby Atmos.
[00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:05.640]   So whether or not you have the downward firing speakers, you're not going to hear it.
[00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:06.640]   Right.
[00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:08.920]   It has to know where to put them in.
[00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:16.440]   And so that's the key there, but I will say that I have a 7-1, yeah, 7-1-2 Dolby system
[00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:17.960]   in my living room.
[00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:18.960]   Dolby Atmos.
[00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:20.800]   Dolby Atmos, yeah.
[00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:24.680]   And so listening to the music there has been, we've been a couple hours, I think I talked
[00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:30.240]   about it before, just listening to the music and it was just really amazing at how much,
[00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:34.840]   you know, where you can hear things, but you can also hear a lot of things that aren't
[00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:35.840]   quite right.
[00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:40.480]   So, you know, we're really in the early days, there's a handful of songs, I think, that
[00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:46.480]   have just the right, you know, all I want to do is have some fun by Cheryl Crow, Summer
[00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:54.240]   of '69, oddly enough, are both ones that you see someone, I thought that, what was the
[00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:57.880]   Beatles tune that was there that I think turned out pretty well, but there's a handful of
[00:40:57.880 --> 00:40:58.880]   these songs.
[00:40:58.880 --> 00:40:59.880]   Here comes the sun and sun and sun.
[00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:00.880]   Yeah.
[00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:01.880]   Really good.
[00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:07.200]   What's interesting about it is that those are done by obviously by folks who've done
[00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:08.200]   a bunch of this.
[00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:13.420]   And one of the things that's interesting is that people who've done film, you know,
[00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:18.240]   films around sound, I think do a better job at doing this because they understand how
[00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:19.720]   to use the center speaker.
[00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:27.240]   So when people are, if you listen to a spatial, if people listen to hear and listen to spatial,
[00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:29.520]   you'll hear some of them sound kind of ghostly.
[00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:38.240]   And that's because it's a music mix and they've put the singer into left and right front
[00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:40.400]   and not the center speaker.
[00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:46.600]   And like for instance, if you listen to Russia's Tom Sawyer, which the instrumentally is unbelievable
[00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:51.200]   in Atmos, just it fills up the entire room and it just comes all around you and the
[00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:53.280]   reverberance is amazing.
[00:41:53.280 --> 00:42:01.160]   But Getty Lee's voice is left and right, which has this odd kind of ghostly.
[00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:04.320]   They think that with the same low's narration as well.
[00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:06.720]   And it sounded very strange to me.
[00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:07.720]   Yeah.
[00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:11.040]   I think that the lack of the use of the center speaker for the voice is, because one of
[00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:15.920]   the things that's really powerful about Atmos is that when you start to create this, basically
[00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:20.720]   you create a theater in your mind with all those songs and what you can spread all the
[00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:21.720]   instruments out.
[00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:23.480]   And so your mind can actually hear them better.
[00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:26.640]   They're not blended together as much as they are with stereo or mono.
[00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:30.040]   And you can start, your mind can start picking them up and hearing where they are.
[00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:32.760]   It's not so much that they're all around you spinning.
[00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:35.560]   It's just that they have a place in your brain and your age.
[00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:37.800]   It's a broader sound stage, basically.
[00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:38.800]   And that's what happens.
[00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:42.640]   In fact, when you hear the Marvin Gaye go from mono to stereo to spatial, it just feels
[00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:43.640]   full.
[00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:45.040]   You hear it opening up.
[00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:49.320]   And so you, and I think with orchestral, you hear more of the chamber, more of the room
[00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:51.920]   because the orchestra is still in front of you.
[00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:52.920]   It has to be.
[00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:53.920]   Right.
[00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:57.840]   Well, and that's one of the things that they can do is they can add the reverb to the surround.
[00:42:57.840 --> 00:43:03.080]   So what it's doing is it's reverbing and it's creating a space with the reverb itself to
[00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:04.200]   kind of let it flow around.
[00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:07.240]   And so I think that, but what's interesting is when they get that right, when they get
[00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:11.280]   all these things that are kind of where they want to be, when the singer sings right out
[00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:15.920]   of that center speaker, you get this really clear, you know, you really hear the instrument.
[00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:21.600]   So even on, so even on speakers, not just headphones, but even on speakers, if you have
[00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:25.440]   a Dolby Atmos surround system, you'll get this effect, Alex.
[00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:26.440]   Oh, yeah.
[00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:27.440]   Yeah.
[00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:28.440]   Yeah.
[00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:29.440]   That's what I thought.
[00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:32.240]   And I've listened to, as I said, I've listened to some Dolby's mix.
[00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:36.000]   Is there any reason they couldn't have done this in Dolby that just decided to do it in
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   Atmos?
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.160]   Well, that is what is what Dolby's.
[00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:41.840]   I mean, yeah, so there's Dolby 5.1 and there's Dolby 7.
[00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:44.320]   But this doesn't get it with Dolby 5.1.
[00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:45.760]   You only get it if you have Dolby Atmos.
[00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:46.760]   It's not that way.
[00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:47.760]   No, it'll fall down.
[00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:52.240]   No, it'll, it'll, it needs to decode it as Atmos, but it should go out to a 5.1.
[00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:53.240]   Oh, yeah, it does.
[00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:54.240]   In the 7.1.
[00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:56.200]   But you need a decoder, an Atmos decoder.
[00:43:56.200 --> 00:44:00.160]   What I'm saying is couldn't they have encoded it in Dolby 5.1 and had the same benefits or
[00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:01.160]   no?
[00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:04.840]   Well, I think that you, you know, what people mostly are doing now is encoding in Atmos,
[00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:06.480]   because Atmos goes to everything.
[00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:11.280]   So why it'll fall down into whatever, because the issue is, is that so at most, it's like
[00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:15.680]   AAC to MP3, it's the next generation of Dolby in effect.
[00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:20.440]   Yeah, and I was all occupied with the upward or the downward firing speakers.
[00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:22.400]   There's not that much in music.
[00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:23.920]   They don't put up a ton of stuff up there.
[00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:24.920]   No, you shouldn't.
[00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:27.200]   There shouldn't be a piano in the sky.
[00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:29.880]   But what you hear sometimes is some reverberators up there.
[00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:30.880]   Oh, yes.
[00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:37.720]   But the, the, the, the Atmos isn't just, Atmos itself is not just a top firing, up firing,
[00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:39.040]   or down firing speakers.
[00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:40.040]   It's also, right.
[00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:41.040]   That was my mistake.
[00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:42.040]   I, I'm admitting that.
[00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:43.040]   Right.
[00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:47.240]   Because what, what happens is, what, what happens is if you're here, it, there are, you know,
[00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:50.400]   you have these speakers that are like this, right?
[00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:56.600]   And, and so the thing is, is that in Atmos, in 5.1, what you have is you're, you're mixing
[00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:57.800]   to each one of these speakers.
[00:44:57.800 --> 00:45:02.280]   It's actually directly to a speaker rather than what, what, what's different about Atmos
[00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:06.320]   is that you, you have 128 channels and some of these are speakers and that's what we call
[00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:07.320]   the bed, right?
[00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:09.120]   So we're putting stuff into the bed.
[00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:11.880]   And that's, that's, so you, in some people will mix everything to the bed.
[00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:16.720]   But what you can do with Atmos is you can start putting objects in here and those objects
[00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:18.520]   live in a 3D space.
[00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:20.720]   That's, that's an infinite resolution.
[00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:26.880]   So these don't care if it's 5, if it's 5.1 or 7, what they know is they, they know they
[00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:30.640]   need to be here and use whatever part of these speakers that it's necessary to get that sound
[00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:31.640]   with it.
[00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:35.760]   So when you're, so when you're mixing the Dolby previous Dolby's, you actually say this
[00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:37.560]   is in the left, left speaker.
[00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:38.560]   This is in the left rear speaker.
[00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:40.600]   You're sending the rations with 9/1.
[00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:45.860]   Oh, so now you can just, anywhere in the 360 degree space you could put a sound.
[00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:48.960]   You can put an object and more importantly you can animate it.
[00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:52.160]   So you can have things like flowing around you and everything else, but you can also just
[00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:56.360]   put, put objects out there and move them around slowly and so on and so forth.
[00:45:56.360 --> 00:45:58.760]   Those are much harder to do inside of the beds.
[00:45:58.760 --> 00:46:05.040]   And so, so the 5.1, you know, so you have the 5.1 and 7 and 7.1 and 7.1 and 2.5.1.4.
[00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:10.960]   And all of those, those, it'll, at most will go out to all of those, but it'll also go
[00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:13.280]   to stereo and the stereo actually sounds really good.
[00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:15.520]   It'll also go to, you know, by neural.
[00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:20.400]   And so, so you can, so a lot of those things can be folded back down, which is why it works.
[00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:25.560]   And so you want to kind of master in, in a perfect world, you master in, in, in, in
[00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:29.240]   at most and then you fold down to the other things and you can't output them so that those
[00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:33.520]   other channels are available if you want to, but then it becomes much more cumbersome on
[00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:36.400]   the, the delivery side.
[00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:40.160]   And so it's, you know, so you have to deliver all, like right now, even for stuff that I
[00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:46.360]   do, I have to, you know, we're delivering in, we, we might be delivering in, in some kind
[00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:49.480]   of immersive, but I also have to put stereo and then you have, you have all these other
[00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:52.040]   pieces that you have to figure out and then you have to figure out how the player is going
[00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:55.680]   to know which one to look at because HLS is a really dumb format.
[00:46:55.680 --> 00:47:00.400]   Not only dumb, like, a dumb idea, but like doesn't know what to do with all the, in the
[00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:03.840]   manifest, the manifest is, here's all the stuff I'm sending the player and the player has
[00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:05.680]   to decide what to grab onto.
[00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:10.520]   So as you start making that manifest more complex, it, then the players get confused.
[00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:12.280]   What am I supposed to, what am I supposed to be playing?
[00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:13.280]   So here's the question.
[00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:18.480]   Should everybody, I mean, I guess going forward, you should look with for, at least for a
[00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:21.560]   good sound system or headphone, something with Dolby at most compatibility.
[00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:22.560]   Yes.
[00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:23.560]   I would.
[00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:24.560]   Yeah.
[00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:25.560]   Your headset.
[00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:28.000]   I mean, everything, I mean, it's, it's going to be something I think that almost everybody's
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   going to want.
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:34.560]   No, I think that's why I upgraded my receiver because I realized I'm not getting, even though
[00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:38.440]   I have a five one system, I'm not getting spatial.
[00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:39.440]   That's very interesting.
[00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:40.440]   Yeah.
[00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:41.440]   It's interesting.
[00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:42.440]   So that's the question.
[00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:45.240]   Is this somebody, the audio in the chat room, what I can see appropriately named says spatial
[00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:47.920]   is the 3D TV of audio yawn.
[00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:48.920]   Yeah.
[00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:51.400]   I'm not sure that's the case actually.
[00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:55.520]   The only difference is that if there were glasses for this Apple didn't do 3D.
[00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:57.320]   So they didn't really push it hard.
[00:47:57.320 --> 00:47:58.320]   Right.
[00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:02.700]   So this is that is that the, these companies, the record companies now, they're in a gold
[00:48:02.700 --> 00:48:04.720]   rush like mentality.
[00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:08.220]   So they're, they're going back to the back catalog and everything that they've got tracks
[00:48:08.220 --> 00:48:12.040]   for they're mixing right now because, so there's this chain reaction that has to happen.
[00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:16.040]   And this is something Apple does really well is that it waits for things to be mature enough
[00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:19.320]   to do it and then it pushes down at the right time.
[00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:23.240]   So at must have been out for a long time, but Apple didn't wait and now that all these
[00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:26.600]   other pieces are in place, Apple starts to push really hard.
[00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:31.760]   And because of their market force moving forward, all, you know, universal and, and Warner Brothers
[00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:35.200]   and all these other, all these other record companies are all diving into their back catalog
[00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:38.240]   to make sure that they're represented the way they want to be represented, you know,
[00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:42.040]   because that's money, you know, people, you know, and so as a result, we're probably
[00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:47.120]   going to have a massive catalog of, of spatial in the not too distant future.
[00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:51.160]   I was really impressed with how much they already have.
[00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:53.960]   But I guess we're going to get a closer to HDR than 3D TV.
[00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:54.960]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:57.400]   It's 3D TV just never really worked well yet.
[00:48:57.400 --> 00:48:58.720]   We're glasses blah, blah, blah.
[00:48:58.720 --> 00:48:59.720]   There are lots of reasons.
[00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:01.200]   And it didn't fit the way the mind works.
[00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:02.200]   Right.
[00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:04.520]   But the ear is just how the ear works.
[00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:08.480]   This is how you're listening in spatial audio in real life.
[00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:09.480]   Yes.
[00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:12.920]   So Andrew, what are you looking at?
[00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:14.560]   Do you have a bird out there?
[00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:16.120]   He's watching the movies being filmed.
[00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:18.680]   He's looking at Kevin Bacon right now.
[00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:20.520]   He's one degree of separation.
[00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:21.520]   You're absolutely right.
[00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:24.760]   I do have a, I have a legit Kevin Bacon sighting right now.
[00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:25.760]   Sorry.
[00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:28.520]   Sorry if it wasn't as close to tension.
[00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:30.160]   Is he a degree?
[00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:31.640]   Is he foot loose?
[00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:34.160]   Is that kind of a degree of separation?
[00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:41.040]   Well, actually it's more like, I would say 20, 30 years of separation right now.
[00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:42.040]   That's sorry.
[00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:43.040]   I'm sorry.
[00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:47.040]   I should have been following along your discussion, your discussion about spatial audio.
[00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:51.360]   It's just that I noticed that there was someone kind of Kevin Bacon-y looking and I just happened
[00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:53.360]   to have my opera classes.
[00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:55.440]   You are so funny.
[00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:59.720]   Can you point your webcam out the window the chat wants to watch it?
[00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:00.720]   That's right.
[00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:04.360]   Because like actually, let's make your camera just be Kevin Bacon Cam.
[00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:07.880]   Well, see also we wouldn't have to pay him because he's on a public street.
[00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:08.880]   Absolutely.
[00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:10.240]   I mean, he probably asked for.
[00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:13.960]   Is he in some sort of retro garb?
[00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:16.440]   Is this a current day, present day?
[00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:20.720]   No, it looks like he's just hanging out and he's chatting with somebody.
[00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:23.800]   Like I said, the filming doesn't start until tomorrow.
[00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:30.240]   So perhaps he's just like there with the letting support.
[00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:31.240]   Sorry.
[00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:34.960]   I'm not much more interested to see Kira Sedgwick to be honest with you.
[00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:35.960]   But all right.
[00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:36.960]   She is the closer.
[00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:37.960]   Sorry.
[00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:38.960]   I'm sorry.
[00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:41.760]   My focus is now on the show.
[00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:43.840]   It's completely on the show.
[00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:46.720]   That's come dance routine from hanging out your window.
[00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:49.080]   That's real spatial videos, what that is.
[00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:50.440]   That's awesome.
[00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:51.440]   That's great.
[00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:52.440]   Let's see.
[00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:54.400]   What else is going on?
[00:50:54.400 --> 00:51:00.080]   Oh, whatever you do, do not name your Wi-Fi access point.
[00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:04.320]   Percent S, percent S, percent S, percent A, percent A, percent S.
[00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:06.840]   Actually, it's percent P, percent S.
[00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:10.160]   Now, if I say it out loud or people are going to do it, you're not going to.
[00:51:10.160 --> 00:51:13.040]   This will break your iPhone.
[00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:17.240]   Percent P, percent S, percent S, percent S, percent S, percent N.
[00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:18.240]   Damn it.
[00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:22.480]   I was naming it after my favorite Discworld character.
[00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:23.480]   Okay, fine.
[00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:26.280]   I guess not Notary Pratchett, fans and Koopa.
[00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:33.080]   I don't know how this guy, Carl Shao, discovered it, but he named his Wi-Fi access point that.
[00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:37.840]   His iPhone disabled its Wi-Fi functionality.
[00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:43.440]   He said, "Neither rebooting or changing the SSID fixes it."
[00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:47.920]   He must have been looking for this because I don't think he would normally make your SSID
[00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:50.240]   be such a strange string.
[00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:52.840]   A thousand humans typing on a thousand terminals.
[00:51:52.840 --> 00:52:00.280]   Maybe he was able to get it back, but I think you have to reset the iPhone's network settings.
[00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:02.160]   So don't do it, folks.
[00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:07.240]   Of course, anybody who's written any C code or maybe Python code will recognize that as
[00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:09.400]   a print formatting command.
[00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:16.400]   Obviously, what's happening is that the iPhone is interpreting it as a print command as opposed
[00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:17.400]   to as a setting.
[00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:20.760]   Something neighbor is just printing reams and reams a paper next to it.
[00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:26.280]   It's still here to come home to quite the surprise.
[00:52:26.280 --> 00:52:28.280]   It's wild, actually.
[00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:34.640]   When asked what his motivation was to name his Wi-Fi with this weird string, he said,
[00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:45.120]   "All my devices are named after format strings, which resolve to the F word with poorly developed
[00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:46.680]   devices.
[00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:47.680]   So he's..."
[00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:50.560]   You're sure this isn't a vulnerability for Linux systems?
[00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:52.720]   He doesn't sound like a Mac guy.
[00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:55.400]   He's like punking people.
[00:52:55.400 --> 00:53:00.240]   50 years of Nix gets you every time.
[00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:01.240]   That's wild.
[00:53:01.240 --> 00:53:04.320]   So yeah, I was really tempted to do this.
[00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:07.400]   Apple, I'm sure, will fix it.
[00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:08.400]   It's actually...
[00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:13.120]   If that does hang it, there is a mistake in the code somewhere.
[00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:16.960]   Which sanitize your inputs, kids.
[00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:17.960]   That's...
[00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:20.160]   We learned that from little Bobby drop tables.
[00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:22.240]   Do not accept...
[00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:28.560]   Do not try to interpret random strings.
[00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:31.320]   I guess that's our public service warning.
[00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:32.800]   It's very odd.
[00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:34.040]   Just don't do it.
[00:53:34.040 --> 00:53:37.840]   Yeah, very odd.
[00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:46.160]   This was... I wasn't going to tell... do this story until I saw it show up on Tech Meme
[00:53:46.160 --> 00:53:49.920]   and Reddit and Hacker News everywhere.
[00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:55.560]   The whole world is celebrating that you can now do picture and picture support on YouTube
[00:53:55.560 --> 00:53:56.560]   for iOS.
[00:53:56.560 --> 00:53:57.560]   Whoa!
[00:53:57.560 --> 00:53:58.560]   Sort of.
[00:53:58.560 --> 00:53:59.560]   Not really.
[00:53:59.560 --> 00:54:00.560]   Applause.
[00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:06.440]   You don't need a help in rap to do something that's been a common feature for years.
[00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:07.440]   Was this a...
[00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:09.200]   YouTube's fault, right?
[00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:10.200]   Yes.
[00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:15.520]   So Apple announced picture and picture for the iPad back in 2015.
[00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:18.000]   And they announced it for the iPhone last year.
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:22.520]   And Google is not always the first to adapt new features to their apps.
[00:54:22.520 --> 00:54:26.360]   But this one took ridiculously long and they blocked the basic functionality.
[00:54:26.360 --> 00:54:30.680]   People would at first just go to Safari, put a video full screen, and then swipe up
[00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:32.480]   and you'd get picture and picture.
[00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:35.600]   And Google put an interrupt event in to just crash the view.
[00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:39.960]   If you did that, you'd have to go to desktop mode to work around it or use a shortcut to
[00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:40.960]   work around it.
[00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:45.560]   It was available on Android, but only free if you were an Android user in the US.
[00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:47.120]   You had to pay for premium.
[00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:49.560]   And it seems like that's what they're doing with the iPhone now.
[00:54:49.560 --> 00:54:51.960]   If you live in the US, it's rolling out.
[00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:52.960]   Not everyone has it yet.
[00:54:52.960 --> 00:54:56.520]   Very few people seem to have it, but you'll get the ability to picture and picture your
[00:54:56.520 --> 00:55:00.120]   YouTube videos for free if you live in the US.
[00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:03.200]   Everywhere else you're going to have to be a paying YouTube premium customer to use
[00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:04.200]   it.
[00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:06.200]   And then you can see that the iPhone is just a small screen.
[00:55:06.200 --> 00:55:07.200]   I don't know why.
[00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:15.760]   Do you all use picture and picture on the iPhone?
[00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:16.760]   It's also not legal.
[00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:19.360]   I don't think it's legal to charge for system default features.
[00:55:19.360 --> 00:55:20.360]   That's a good point.
[00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:21.360]   Yeah.
[00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:22.360]   That's a good point.
[00:55:22.360 --> 00:55:26.120]   I guess you could use your iPhone while you're watching a video.
[00:55:26.120 --> 00:55:27.120]   I don't.
[00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:28.120]   I do it for no.
[00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:30.640]   Sometimes put a video up in type notes as I'm watching it.
[00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:35.720]   I can see on the iPad or a laptop, but I don't understand on the iPhone or you want to watch
[00:55:35.720 --> 00:55:37.200]   a video, but also keep an eye.
[00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:38.440]   You're on a bus or a train.
[00:55:38.440 --> 00:55:41.360]   You want to keep an eye on exactly where you are or where you're stopping.
[00:55:41.360 --> 00:55:44.960]   I mean, it's a useful enough feature that you want to throw it in and just let other
[00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:45.960]   people figure it out.
[00:55:45.960 --> 00:55:47.720]   People are very excited about this.
[00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:50.600]   I mean, I guess because they've been starved.
[00:55:50.600 --> 00:55:54.640]   Google's mobile apps are just not what you would expect them to be.
[00:55:54.640 --> 00:55:58.760]   It shows you how philosophically they think that if you're that if you really want the
[00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:03.480]   best experience, you're going to use a web app specifically through the Chrome browser,
[00:56:03.480 --> 00:56:08.400]   because even on Android, on iOS and Android, you think that Google Docs app, the Sheets
[00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:11.480]   app would be really, really good, but it's not the best experience.
[00:56:11.480 --> 00:56:14.160]   The best experience is still through a browser.
[00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:19.160]   It's better on Google Docs tools are better on Safari than they are like through the actual
[00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:20.840]   official Google app.
[00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:27.040]   And that is that if that isn't a demonstration of at least of either a Google choosing their
[00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:32.440]   power in the industry to get what they want the way they want it, mostly be able to collect
[00:56:32.440 --> 00:56:36.000]   as much data as they want without having to deal with app rules, or they're just being
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:42.800]   so thick-headed that they cannot imagine a world in which a native actual app is going
[00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:46.160]   to be the better choice than something that comes through a web view.
[00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:47.840]   I don't know what it is.
[00:56:47.840 --> 00:56:48.840]   Yeah.
[00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:50.440]   Well, we got it now.
[00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:57.000]   Yeah, I have to say, Apple doesn't do its best work on non-Apple platforms.
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:58.000]   I think that's just kind of the difference.
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:06.520]   But there's a difference because Apple makes our money on their devices.
[00:57:06.520 --> 00:57:07.520]   Google makes our money on their services.
[00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:12.200]   So it behooves Google to be good horizontally and behooves Apple to be good vertically.
[00:57:12.200 --> 00:57:16.000]   But Google is not quite doing either at this point.
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:17.000]   Yeah.
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:19.440]   Well, it's not really our portfolio.
[00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:23.480]   We'll certainly be talking about it tomorrow, but you saw the article about Sundar Pichai
[00:57:23.480 --> 00:57:24.480]   in The Times.
[00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:26.720]   I know because we were talking about that.
[00:57:26.720 --> 00:57:28.400]   He started to get-- it's funny.
[00:57:28.400 --> 00:57:33.840]   I had not really thought about it until about two months ago when Mike Elgin was on Twitter
[00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:40.000]   and he said, "Sunder Pichai is the worst CEO imaginable for Google."
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:44.520]   And now they're certain of us some of a drumbeat going on.
[00:57:44.520 --> 00:57:50.560]   I think that the-- I think that Larry Page is a lot more forceful.
[00:57:50.560 --> 00:57:54.120]   So I think that that-- I think that the page was a lot more forceful and I think that there
[00:57:54.120 --> 00:57:56.440]   was a little bit more cut and dry.
[00:57:56.440 --> 00:58:00.080]   And I think that I think Sundar is actually more flexible.
[00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:03.200]   Yeah, nobody questions Sundar's intelligence.
[00:58:03.200 --> 00:58:04.720]   He's a very nice person.
[00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:06.560]   I've had conversations with him.
[00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:07.560]   He's a very smart guy.
[00:58:07.560 --> 00:58:08.560]   Nobody's questioning that.
[00:58:08.560 --> 00:58:09.560]   It's just whether he's--
[00:58:09.560 --> 00:58:12.800]   Yeah, but I think that it's not-- I don't know if it's clear directives.
[00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:15.920]   And the problem that Google has right now is-- I was just talking to someone about this
[00:58:15.920 --> 00:58:19.080]   that does development and they just said, "Problems now."
[00:58:19.080 --> 00:58:21.640]   It used to be that you'd wait for six months for Google.
[00:58:21.640 --> 00:58:24.040]   When Google released something, you'd wait for six months to see if they're going to
[00:58:24.040 --> 00:58:25.040]   keep it.
[00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:27.000]   And he goes, "Now it's four or five years."
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:30.440]   It's like we have to see it sit there for four or five years before we're going to start
[00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:31.440]   developing for it.
[00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:32.440]   Even then.
[00:58:32.440 --> 00:58:35.160]   But they're just like, "But it's getting to the point where they don't want to develop
[00:58:35.160 --> 00:58:39.400]   for-- they don't want to develop for anything new because they just-- the Google's willingness
[00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:44.520]   to start something and then start something half-baked and then quit because it didn't
[00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:51.760]   get anywhere is-- it really is starting to build a pattern that scares developers away.
[00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:54.360]   And not just scares developers away, but scares brands away.
[00:58:54.360 --> 00:58:56.880]   You look at the Hangout brand that I was deep into.
[00:58:56.880 --> 00:59:04.240]   And you have a lot of brands that spend millions of dollars building up their presence there
[00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:08.440]   and people doing a lot of work on it and then it just kind of went away.
[00:59:08.440 --> 00:59:15.760]   And even if you're losing, leaving that quickly really left a deep-- and it just happened
[00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:17.720]   over and over and over again.
[00:59:17.720 --> 00:59:22.120]   And that-- doing that kind of showing your work in public all the time of, "We're going
[00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:23.120]   to try this and no one out.
[00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:25.000]   No, we're not going to do that."
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:28.120]   Really creates a-- it's hard to get people to work with you at some point.
[00:59:28.120 --> 00:59:30.400]   And I think that Google's running up against that more and more.
[00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:33.280]   And they still have the thing that makes money, which is ads.
[00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:37.000]   Like there's-- it's still-- the core thing is still making lots and lots of money.
[00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:40.000]   So they have one thing that keeps them going, but all the other experiments aren't going
[00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:45.080]   well and are going more poorly every day because they don't stick with it.
[00:59:45.080 --> 00:59:46.080]   Yeah.
[00:59:46.080 --> 00:59:50.440]   I thought Neil Seibert had a really canny take where he said that, you know, initially they
[00:59:50.440 --> 00:59:54.440]   kept promoting Sundar Pachai, but Larry Page and Sergey Brin still have all the voting
[00:59:54.440 --> 00:59:55.440]   controller or Google.
[00:59:55.440 --> 00:59:57.840]   Google-- they can still do anything they want with Alphabet.
[00:59:57.840 --> 01:00:01.880]   But over the years, they hired a CFO who just cut everything and shrank everything and
[01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:04.400]   downsides everything until they got bored.
[01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:07.600]   And yet they got bored and they stopped trying to-- whole goal was to try to invent the new
[01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:10.520]   Google, incubate the next Google inside of Alphabet.
[01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:13.120]   But everything got cut to the point where they were having no fun anymore.
[01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:18.240]   So they stopped and now all you have is Sundar just managing the boat without anybody throwing
[01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:19.760]   all the balls around on the inside.
[01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:20.760]   Yeah.
[01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:21.760]   Yeah.
[01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:25.800]   It's weird that you do get this kind of Game of Thrones sort of thing that's happening.
[01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:31.960]   You don't know whether this is actual real distaste with his leadership or whether this
[01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:35.880]   is just, well, let's put some pressure on and let them feel the heat.
[01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:40.720]   The timing of this was interesting because just last month, WIRED did a really good interview
[01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:44.920]   with Pregovar Raghavan, who is senior vice president.
[01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:46.000]   He runs ads.
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000]   He runs payments.
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.280]   He runs Google Assistant.
[01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:56.080]   And the WIRED headline was, "Pregovar Raghavan isn't CEO of Google.
[01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:57.840]   He just runs the place."
[01:00:57.840 --> 01:01:04.480]   Which is the sort of stuff that-- if a palace coup is coming, you find-- that's when the
[01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:13.400]   Assistant, the Regent to the Ailing King suddenly gets press about how his firm leadership
[01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:21.320]   is felt throughout the walls of power, throughout Congress, throughout it's weird.
[01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:24.320]   Even though it's a great interview because--
[01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:25.320]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:34.200]   We have to make sure that Sundar makes an appearance at the parade, like with his slumped
[01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:39.640]   over with his hand just like waving weekend at Bernie's style, reviewing the troops.
[01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:40.640]   Oh, God.
[01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:42.840]   All right, we've got a good team here.
[01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:43.840]   We've got a great panel.
[01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:44.840]   And you know what?
[01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:45.920]   Who cares if there's no Apple News?
[01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:49.040]   There's plenty of tidbits now.
[01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:53.080]   It's the tidbits with apologies to our friends from tidbits.
[01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:54.840]   In honor of our friends.
[01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:55.840]   In honor.
[01:01:55.840 --> 01:01:56.840]   This is the--
[01:01:56.840 --> 01:01:57.840]   It's in homage.
[01:01:57.840 --> 01:01:58.840]   It's the stems.
[01:01:58.840 --> 01:01:59.840]   The tip of the head.
[01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:02.880]   The sink to the bottom coming up.
[01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:08.040]   Are you playing with iOS and iPad 15, iPad OS 15, Renee?
[01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:09.040]   I think you are.
[01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:10.040]   Yes, sir.
[01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:11.040]   Anybody else?
[01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:12.040]   Yes.
[01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:13.040]   Not me, not yet.
[01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:15.560]   I thought this was an interesting article today in 9-5 Mac.
[01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:22.280]   iPad OS 15 makes Instagram and other iPhone only apps a little less frustrating because
[01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:27.520]   of the new way that multitasking works.
[01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:31.080]   Having a kind of a vertical only app isn't so bad.
[01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:35.600]   I haven't even tried this, but now I'm kind of intrigued.
[01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:37.120]   Have you tried that, Renee?
[01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:38.120]   Yeah.
[01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:42.720]   It's totally true, but at the same time it makes me just incredibly salty that Instagram
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:43.720]   still doesn't have iPad.
[01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:45.560]   I still understand that, yeah.
[01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:49.080]   Yeah, it's baffling to me because it would be such a good experience to sit there and
[01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:50.640]   browse and enjoy.
[01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:54.240]   And if they want me to shop, iPad has really, really good shopping metrics.
[01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:56.640]   I mean, let me shop if that's your core business.
[01:02:56.640 --> 01:03:00.600]   If you're going to supplement creator's income by affiliates, make that shopping
[01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:03.640]   experience great and part of a great shopping experience is iPad support.
[01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:04.640]   It's baffling.
[01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:05.640]   Yeah.
[01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:09.320]   And they could get away with so much more by encouraging people to work through a browser
[01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:11.520]   instead of through an approved Apple app.
[01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:12.600]   So yeah, I agree with Renee.
[01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:18.380]   I don't understand why they're so adamant against making a decent iPad experience or a
[01:03:18.380 --> 01:03:20.680]   decent desktop experience for that matter.
[01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:27.360]   WB has made speaking of shopping, Ted Lasso official gear available.
[01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:32.480]   You could be really obvious and have a giant Ted Lasso on your t-shirt or mug.
[01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:38.880]   You could get a little less obvious by having quotes like be a goldfish or smells like potential
[01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:42.240]   or I believe in believe what is I watched Ted Lasso.
[01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:43.720]   I don't remember be a goldfish.
[01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:45.280]   What was that all about?
[01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:50.760]   That was from like the first or second episode where the one of the when the rookies was getting
[01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:55.920]   we had screwed up because he's missing his homeland and Ted after got like after he got
[01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:59.360]   dressed down by the other people in the field like Ted brought him over saying, you know
[01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:02.480]   what goldfish only remembers things for like 10 seconds.
[01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:04.720]   You know, you should I think you should be a goldfish.
[01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:07.680]   I'm trying to say forget what happened 10 seconds ago.
[01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:08.680]   Just keep going.
[01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:09.960]   Well, apparently it's very popular.
[01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:15.120]   There's quite a few, but I think if you're really a serious Ted Lasso fan, you will get
[01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:21.440]   the rich, but AFC Richmond personalized jerseys, which no one will get unless they're a Ted
[01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:22.440]   Lasso fan.
[01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:23.440]   Then I just think you guys.
[01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:28.400]   I think you guys have a lot of people who are like, you know, I think you guys have a
[01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:32.200]   lot of people who are like, you know, I think you guys have a lot of people who are like,

[01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:55.880]   who are like, you guys have a lot of people who are like, you guys have a lot of people
[01:05:55.880 --> 01:06:00.880]   who are like, you guys have a lot of people who are like, you guys have a lot of people
[01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:05.880]   who are like, you guys have a lot of people who are like, you guys have a lot of people
[01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:09.880]   who are like, you guys have a lot of people who are like, you guys have a lot of people
[01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:13.880]   who are like, you guys have a lot of people who are like, you guys have a lot of people
[01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:17.880]   who are like, you guys have a lot of people who are like, you guys have a lot of people
[01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:21.880]   who are like, you guys have a lot of people who are like, you guys have a lot of people
[01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:25.880]   who are like, you guys have a lot of people who are like, you guys have a lot of people
[01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:29.880]   who are like, you guys have a lot of people who are like, you guys have a lot of people
[01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:33.880]   who are like, you guys have a lot of people who are like, you guys have a lot of people
[01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:37.880]   who are like, you guys have a lot of people who are like, you guys have a lot of people
[01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:41.880]   who are like, you guys have a lot of people who are like, you guys have a lot of people who are
[01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:45.560]   Dune, which we've been reading about for a while.
[01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:49.360]   It's Keegan, Michael Key, Fred Armist, and Kristen Chenoweth,
[01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:52.760]   and Sisley Strong.
[01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:56.240]   The characters discovered the magical town of Schmigadoon
[01:06:56.240 --> 01:06:58.960]   on a backpacking trip where everyone acts like they're
[01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:02.700]   in a 1940s musical.
[01:07:02.700 --> 01:07:03.440]   It's intriguing.
[01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:05.840]   That comes out July 16th.
[01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:06.800]   They're really trying to reach me.
[01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:09.320]   I feel like they're trying to reach me.
[01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:10.440]   They're working on one thing.
[01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:12.600]   Interesting.
[01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:13.680]   Some people are saying it's HBO.
[01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:15.080]   I don't think it's quite HBO.
[01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:18.840]   But it is a very eclectic, interesting, not programmatic,
[01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:20.840]   not entirely franchise driven strategy, which
[01:07:20.840 --> 01:07:22.600]   is very different from many of the other.
[01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:23.840]   It's very appily.
[01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:27.560]   When I read about shows like Coda, a coming of age story
[01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:29.560]   about a high school senior who's the only hearing
[01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:33.040]   person or a deaf family.
[01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:35.160]   Coda stands for child of deaf adults.
[01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:40.040]   That's the kind of Apple show I would expect Apple to produce.
[01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:43.800]   It's about doing good and feeling good more
[01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:46.640]   than it is about high drama.
[01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:49.640]   They have a very PBS sort of mentality, I think.
[01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:51.640]   Meaning that it's OK.
[01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:53.640]   They want everything that they do to be something
[01:07:53.640 --> 01:07:54.960]   that they can be proud of.
[01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:59.400]   And excuse me, maybe to the point they want nothing that
[01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:02.600]   looks just tasteful or that they can be ashamed of.
[01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:05.480]   And another thing that I was just reading about, not
[01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:08.800]   specifically about Apple, but about these streaming exclusives
[01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:10.880]   that might give Apple a big advantage,
[01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:13.880]   turns out that a lot of production houses are kind of upset
[01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:15.520]   with Disney and they're upset with Netflix,
[01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:16.800]   Netflix specifically.
[01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:19.440]   Because the business model that Netflix does
[01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:23.080]   means that it's not about doing 100 episodes
[01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:24.640]   and then going into syndication.
[01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:27.000]   It's about, well, we own this show because of the deal
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:28.840]   that you've struck with us.
[01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:32.240]   We're going to get a lot of heat and a lot of visibility
[01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:33.480]   from you for two seasons.
[01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:37.160]   But we're not going to continue to renew this show once it starts
[01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:40.040]   going long enough that actors are going to start asking for raises,
[01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:41.840]   that producers are going to start asking for raises.
[01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:44.440]   So you're going to get two seasons and then that's it.
[01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:49.400]   So if they can offer a better deal to producers at Apple TV,
[01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:52.840]   at Apple TV, saying that we won't lock you into Apple TV,
[01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:57.360]   you will be able to sell your series outside of episodes
[01:08:57.360 --> 01:09:01.200]   of the series outside of the Apple TV platform,
[01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:02.320]   that would be a great thing.
[01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:06.360]   I mean, I'm sort of an unfortunate both.
[01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:11.360]   There's a new series on, I think, AMC as a Kevin can blank himself
[01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:15.120]   that I'm super, super interested in such a creative idea.
[01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:19.480]   But I'm not going to sign up for AMC or AMC's streaming
[01:09:19.480 --> 01:09:21.040]   just so I can watch this one show.
[01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:25.320]   But I'm more than willing to give the production company $22
[01:09:25.320 --> 01:09:29.920]   to buy the entire season on Google Play or on Apple TV.
[01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:31.640]   And once you get locked into these things,
[01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:33.560]   we're the only place to see the Mandalorian
[01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:35.720]   or the only place to see this documentary
[01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:39.880]   is by getting access to this streaming service.
[01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:43.920]   It kind of, it really does put everything into a castle
[01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:48.040]   and you kind of have to be like Mario and rescue the content
[01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:50.440]   at the very, very end and only to find that your content
[01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:52.040]   is another castle.
[01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:53.080]   Didn't they announce that the Disney,
[01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:55.040]   does not going to put any of their Marvel or Star Wars shows
[01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:56.040]   on Blu-ray or DVD?
[01:09:56.040 --> 01:09:57.040]   No other vision on DVD.
[01:09:57.040 --> 01:09:58.520]   You could only ever watch them.
[01:09:58.520 --> 01:09:59.520]   Yeah.
[01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:00.520]   I'm just--
[01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:02.440]   I'm wondering because it's not, you know, even Disney,
[01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:04.560]   you know, the bandwidth is great, but it's not,
[01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:08.040]   it's probably the highest bit rate of everybody,
[01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:11.320]   but Apple and Disney are way ahead of everybody else
[01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:13.320]   as far as bit rate goes.
[01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:15.480]   But it's still not, you know, Blu-ray
[01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:17.800]   or not what it could be delivered at.
[01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:21.560]   And so it's interesting to see how that goes
[01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:23.280]   from a quality perspective.
[01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:25.760]   You know, I think that, I think it is,
[01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:28.160]   there's a big race right now because there's a lot of people
[01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:30.080]   like I now look at the new ones that are coming out,
[01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:32.600]   Paramount and Peacock and everything else.
[01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:34.440]   And I kind of just go, well, I've subscribed to it.
[01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:36.760]   I have all the content I need.
[01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:39.040]   Like literally, like I'm just like,
[01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:40.720]   I don't think I need to do anymore.
[01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:43.080]   Now eventually I might decide to trade and go,
[01:10:43.080 --> 01:10:46.400]   okay, well, 'cause I have Netflix and Hulu and Disney Plus
[01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:51.400]   and YouTube TV and Apple, Apple TV and HBO Max.
[01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:54.880]   Those are the ones that I have.
[01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:56.120]   I'm not interested in any of the ones.
[01:10:56.120 --> 01:10:56.960]   Yeah.
[01:10:56.960 --> 01:10:57.960]   Like I'm not, I'm like, I'm not looking,
[01:10:57.960 --> 01:10:58.800]   like everyone else was too late.
[01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:00.400]   I just can't buy another subscription.
[01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:02.720]   And if I find myself not going to one,
[01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:05.200]   like Netflix, I'm kind of like, ah, every day I'm just kind of
[01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:08.160]   like, the stand ups keep me in for Netflix.
[01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:09.840]   That actually was one of the things we thought about
[01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:13.280]   with Club Twit is, can we get somebody to pay another
[01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:16.360]   seven bucks a month given that all the other subscriptions?
[01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:18.320]   You know, and I know the jury is still out on that.
[01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:19.680]   We've, it's done pretty well.
[01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:22.880]   I think we have three of thousand on our way to 4,000 subs,
[01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:26.320]   but we really want to get to 10,000 for it to make sense.
[01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:31.040]   And we'd like to get 10% subscription rate,
[01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:33.400]   which would be about 70,000.
[01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:37.360]   So it's pretty, it's pretty low compared to the total audience.
[01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:39.200]   But we didn't want to do a paywall.
[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:41.360]   We just wanted to give people a chance to support it,
[01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:43.520]   get out three versions, no tracking.
[01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:44.360]   I don't know.
[01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:45.160]   I think the jury is still out.
[01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:46.000]   That's a lot.
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:46.840]   You did seven bucks.
[01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:47.720]   You know, I understand.
[01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:49.680]   You got to get, you got to give people an opportunity
[01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:50.920]   to fall in love with your content.
[01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:52.760]   And if that doesn't happen when it's all locked up,
[01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:54.600]   I mean, I got the 15 years.
[01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:55.840]   Now it's time to pay up.
[01:11:55.840 --> 01:11:57.320]   (laughing)
[01:11:57.320 --> 01:11:59.800]   I had a little something, maybe.
[01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:01.040]   I hadn't experienced the other day
[01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:04.240]   that really showed me exactly how much sympathy I have
[01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:06.440]   for people who are running big studios
[01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:07.400]   and running big channels.
[01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:12.160]   Because, so I pick up the remote to my streaming box.
[01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:14.800]   And I see where it's one of those Apple TV
[01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:16.200]   where it just puts everything that's new
[01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:17.520]   and this one big bin.
[01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:19.880]   And you don't know whether it's a feature film
[01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:21.920]   streaming from Disney Plus or from YouTube
[01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:23.040]   or from wherever else.
[01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:26.840]   And so I see, oh well, here is the brand new Pixar movie
[01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:30.240]   from one of the greatest animated studios ever.
[01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:34.400]   And next to it is, oh, Fran Blanche has a new 11 minute video
[01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:38.040]   about getting a vintage Soviet eight inch high
[01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:40.800]   vacuum fluorescent LED display working.
[01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:43.840]   And I wanna see Fran Blanche try to get that damn thing
[01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:45.520]   working 'cause she's great as an engineer,
[01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:46.520]   so he's engaging.
[01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:48.840]   And so all this work that went into the story
[01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:50.680]   and the development and the marketing are like,
[01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:55.680]   we just got, we just got, got passed by an engineer
[01:12:55.960 --> 01:13:00.200]   in Philadelphia who's doing 11 minutes of really great content
[01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:04.600]   that probably cost her all of like $80 if that to produce.
[01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:06.120]   And wow, that's where we are right now.
[01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:07.520]   They're on the same thing.
[01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:09.000]   - And I think that the challenge that they have
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.120]   is that with all the indecision,
[01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:13.840]   we get into the family, we get into arguments
[01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:15.560]   back and forth about what we're gonna watch.
[01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:19.040]   And probably one night a week at least,
[01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:20.880]   we just end up watching TikTok.
[01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:21.880]   - What?
[01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:23.640]   Like we just go, we all just go.
[01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:25.760]   - I would not encourage that kind of behavior.
[01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:27.480]   - We just go, oh, it's just easier to then try
[01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:28.560]   to figure out what we wanna watch.
[01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:29.400]   We can't get anything.
[01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:31.000]   - Put it on the screen, you put it on the big screen.
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:32.680]   - Yeah, we air play it to those things.
[01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:33.520]   - Who's Swiper?
[01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:34.360]   - Who's the Swiper?
[01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:38.280]   - I'm the Swiper, but I get some pretty heavy push
[01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:39.680]   from the kids.
[01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:42.280]   - Dad, we were watching that.
[01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:43.640]   - No, it's not appropriate.
[01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:44.480]   - That's usually it.
[01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:46.680]   Usually if it's scientific, my son is like,
[01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:48.320]   oh, we'll be like, okay, this guy's talking too long.
[01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:49.840]   - Like a minute, it's a minute.
[01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:50.840]   It's like, I'm 30 seconds to do it.
[01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:51.840]   - It's shaking more than a minute.
[01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:52.920]   It's only a minute.
[01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:54.720]   - They're going to three minutes now.
[01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:55.560]   - Oh, are they even then?
[01:13:55.560 --> 01:13:56.400]   - Oh, good.
[01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:57.240]   - Oh, is that why?
[01:13:57.240 --> 01:13:58.280]   'Cause some of them seem like they're going on
[01:13:58.280 --> 01:13:59.840]   for an eternity.
[01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:00.840]   It's up to three minutes now.
[01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:01.680]   That's what's been,
[01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:02.680]   I think that I lost time.
[01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:05.040]   - Is it already up there?
[01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:05.880]   - I don't know if it's already,
[01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:07.240]   but they're not gonna do this one.
[01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:08.360]   - You're just teaching your kids
[01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:10.360]   that with short attention span, Alex.
[01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:11.360]   - Just like that.
[01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:13.000]   - But we watch for a long time.
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:14.360]   Just lots of different things.
[01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:15.600]   It's anyway, so.
[01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:18.600]   - And Instagram reels are 30 seconds, so yeah.
[01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:19.600]   - Very awesome.
[01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:23.400]   - So they are bringing Jason Momoa's C back.
[01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:24.960]   That'll be season two of that.
[01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:27.080]   And you Marvel fans will be glad to know
[01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:30.280]   Dave Batista is joining the cast,
[01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:32.240]   along with Jason Momoa.
[01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:34.000]   Did they appear on the big screen together?
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.040]   The Aquaman ever appear with.
[01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:37.600]   - No, Aquaman and Drax are a story
[01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:39.400]   are in two separate universes.
[01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:40.880]   - Separate universes?
[01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:42.840]   Well, the universes collide.
[01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:45.360]   Next season on C.
[01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:48.440]   I actually didn't like the morning show all that much,
[01:14:48.440 --> 01:14:50.440]   but I will watch season two.
[01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:53.280]   - The last two episodes I thought were really, really good.
[01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:56.320]   - They kinda hit their stride at the end.
[01:14:56.320 --> 01:14:58.320]   And you kinda wanna know what's gonna happen now
[01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:01.520]   that everything's up in the air, so.
[01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:03.960]   - I do think that Disney Plus has done a pretty good job
[01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:06.880]   of the, it drove me a little crazy.
[01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:07.840]   Still drives me a little crazy,
[01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:09.960]   but this whole like, we're gonna release them one at a time.
[01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:13.440]   'Cause I will admit that on Friday nights we watch Loki.
[01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:14.360]   - Yeah, Loki's good.
[01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:15.440]   - I have to say it's different.
[01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:16.560]   It's not what I thought it would be,
[01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:18.080]   but I thought it was quite interesting.
[01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:20.120]   - But it just seamless, like, oh, and before that,
[01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:21.120]   we were watching Winter Soldier,
[01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:22.920]   before that we were watching. - It's like TV.
[01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:24.600]   - It used to be, it's like. - It's like,
[01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:26.440]   they wanted a vision and then before that Mandalorian.
[01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:28.280]   And so they've got this kind of, you know,
[01:15:28.280 --> 01:15:29.240]   they're spinning it up.
[01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:32.400]   And what's interesting to see there is whether content
[01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:34.840]   will continue to go down the path of, you know,
[01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:37.000]   talking to some folks in Hollywood.
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.600]   You know, there's a lot less risk in putting stuff out
[01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:42.960]   at six episodes at a time, then a movie.
[01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:45.000]   You know, like, then a film, you know, and so.
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.440]   - Well, it's also, for a lot of stories,
[01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:50.640]   I'm glad they're not doing "Dune" as a two-hour movie.
[01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:52.520]   - Yeah. - For a foundation.
[01:15:52.520 --> 01:15:53.920]   For a lot of things, I think.
[01:15:53.920 --> 01:15:55.280]   - Or Sandman, yeah. - Or Sandman.
[01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:59.840]   You having that extra time to show the whole thing is great.
[01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:02.280]   - As a viewer, I'm finding myself,
[01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:04.880]   I rather see six hours or eight hours
[01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:06.680]   of character development than two and a half.
[01:16:06.680 --> 01:16:07.960]   - Me too. - You know, I'm not sure.
[01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:08.800]   I'm not sure how many times I'm.
[01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:12.240]   - That's part of taste of change, though, clearly, right?
[01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:14.120]   But this is a new medium.
[01:16:14.120 --> 01:16:16.000]   - But that's 'cause we're spending real money on these.
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:19.400]   The difference is now is that we're spending
[01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:23.320]   near future level, sometimes feature level money
[01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:25.560]   on the episodes, you know?
[01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:30.560]   So I think that is part of what makes this not just like TV.
[01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:32.960]   - I do prefer to really be shot.
[01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:34.280]   - I disagree with you on that.
[01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:38.720]   I sometimes will hold off on a show until we can binge it.
[01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:40.120]   - Yeah, you can binge as long as you're willing
[01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:41.080]   to wait the next week.
[01:16:41.080 --> 01:16:43.760]   - Yeah, I have a, there's too much,
[01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:47.160]   so it's part and parcel of having six hours.
[01:16:47.160 --> 01:16:49.240]   I also don't wanna have to wait a week
[01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:50.960]   and try to remember details.
[01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:52.480]   - Oh yeah.
[01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:53.320]   - No, I think so.
[01:16:53.320 --> 01:16:55.080]   I mean, we binge old ones,
[01:16:55.080 --> 01:16:58.400]   so we're kind of working through lost now.
[01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:00.880]   - Yeah. - But we spent six months
[01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:03.280]   on Heroes and watch it every night.
[01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:05.000]   Like, that was the thing we watched.
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:06.280]   - I wonder what's gonna happen.
[01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:08.160]   I'm sure producers prefer,
[01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:11.200]   and maybe the networks prefer spreading it out
[01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:13.240]   because you can keep the buzz going longer,
[01:17:13.240 --> 01:17:15.360]   you can give people more time to analyze it,
[01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:18.320]   you can have the sense of what's next
[01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:21.160]   as opposed to no spoilers.
[01:17:21.160 --> 01:17:23.880]   And so I think, I understand why streaming services
[01:17:23.880 --> 01:17:25.720]   and producers would like to stretch it out.
[01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:28.040]   - I think it's all just to keep you there for--
[01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:29.400]   - Yeah, as long as possible.
[01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:31.000]   - When Mandalorian came out, it came out
[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:32.840]   and then I immediately unsubscribed.
[01:17:32.840 --> 01:17:33.920]   I was like, there's nothing else in Disney
[01:17:33.920 --> 01:17:34.920]   that I don't own that long.
[01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:36.520]   - Are they gonna put that out on DVD?
[01:17:36.520 --> 01:17:38.400]   No. - No.
[01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:39.720]   - And you're not gonna be able to buy it?
[01:17:39.720 --> 01:17:40.640]   Can you buy it?
[01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:43.480]   You have to subscribe.
[01:17:43.480 --> 01:17:45.320]   - Yeah, I don't like it.
[01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:46.160]   - You can buy, I don't like it.
[01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:47.280]   - No, I think you can buy Marvel.
[01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:49.840]   I think you can buy Marvel on iTunes.
[01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:50.920]   You have to check, but I'm pretty sure
[01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:52.120]   you can buy the Marvel stuff, yeah.
[01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:53.880]   - Like, one division or--
[01:17:53.880 --> 01:17:55.520]   - I think if you wanna pay for it.
[01:17:55.520 --> 01:17:57.920]   - Oh, I don't know about the series, the films.
[01:17:57.920 --> 01:17:59.080]   - Oh, the films you can't.
[01:17:59.080 --> 01:18:00.560]   No one's talking about series.
[01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:01.760]   - No, I think the series are all in the,
[01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:03.200]   you have to subscribe.
[01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:05.120]   - Mandalorian is gonna be available on Google Play.
[01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:07.000]   - See, that's really interesting.
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:11.360]   That's a, that's kind of a consumer hostile,
[01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:12.840]   but business positive.
[01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:13.960]   - It is, but there's so much,
[01:18:13.960 --> 01:18:15.960]   like there's an ecosystem that they could build
[01:18:15.960 --> 01:18:18.840]   around these shows that we've only seen little hints of,
[01:18:18.840 --> 01:18:21.440]   where you see a behind the scenes from Mandalorian,
[01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:23.880]   for instance, which has been mostly hamfisted,
[01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:25.680]   like not very great, but--
[01:18:25.680 --> 01:18:27.520]   - There's an opportunity though, I agree.
[01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:29.200]   - Yeah, you could now build this huge amount
[01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:30.280]   of behind the scenes.
[01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:31.840]   You could build alternate stories.
[01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:33.360]   You could build all kinds of other things
[01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:35.520]   that are all part of the execution.
[01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:37.280]   So there could be the six episodes,
[01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:38.840]   but there could be little side episodes
[01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:41.480]   and there could be extra things that go on
[01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:44.800]   and discussions with the actors or the director.
[01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:47.560]   And all of those things could be part of that thing.
[01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:51.040]   So that your tent pole of that piece
[01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:53.880]   could generate hundreds of hours of content
[01:18:53.880 --> 01:18:56.360]   that are connected and only made valuable
[01:18:56.360 --> 01:18:57.520]   through their connection.
[01:18:57.520 --> 01:18:59.680]   So you have something that costs a lot of money to make,
[01:18:59.680 --> 01:19:01.240]   then you have lots of things that don't cost a lot of money
[01:19:01.240 --> 01:19:04.360]   to make, but they're made more valuable from a viewer
[01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:07.800]   minute viewing perspective by being there
[01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:09.720]   and connected to the main content.
[01:19:09.720 --> 01:19:10.920]   - Apple is dribbling out these--
[01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:12.280]   - The creators get paid more.
[01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:13.120]   - Say again?
[01:19:13.120 --> 01:19:15.640]   - I think creators get paid more for the streams too.
[01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:18.240]   I think it was-- - Oh, that's interesting.
[01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:20.360]   Craig Mason and John August who were saying
[01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:23.280]   that the weird way their last deal worked out
[01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:25.440]   is they get paid significantly more for streams
[01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:27.160]   than they get paid for purchases.
[01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:28.360]   And so all this streaming stuff,
[01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:29.800]   which nobody thought would have any value
[01:19:29.800 --> 01:19:31.880]   when they made the deal like five, six years ago,
[01:19:31.880 --> 01:19:33.680]   is suddenly a bonanza for all the writers.
[01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:35.040]   - Good, good.
[01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:37.720]   I like, I want the creatives to get rich on this stuff.
[01:19:37.720 --> 01:19:38.560]   - Same.
[01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:41.000]   - Apple's gonna have,
[01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:44.080]   clearly has a strategy with releasing this new stuff.
[01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:47.480]   So for instance, C will come out in August,
[01:19:47.480 --> 01:19:50.320]   the morning show comes out in September.
[01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:51.960]   There's a new show called Invasion,
[01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:54.600]   this sounds kind of interesting, comes out in October.
[01:19:54.600 --> 01:19:58.680]   Apple calls it a character driven science fiction drama series
[01:19:58.680 --> 01:20:00.720]   that follows an alien invasion
[01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:02.680]   through different perspectives around the world.
[01:20:02.680 --> 01:20:04.880]   I like that in principle.
[01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:10.600]   This being done by Simon Kinberg and David Weil.
[01:20:10.600 --> 01:20:12.080]   - It's the guy who did Dark Phoenix though,
[01:20:12.080 --> 01:20:14.240]   so we'll have to see how everything turns out.
[01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:15.320]   - Uh oh.
[01:20:15.320 --> 01:20:17.680]   - Sam Neill is starring in it.
[01:20:17.680 --> 01:20:21.520]   The shrink next door based on a popular podcast.
[01:20:21.520 --> 01:20:23.400]   Okay, let's go to the next one.
[01:20:23.400 --> 01:20:24.780]   No, I'll just,
[01:20:24.780 --> 01:20:26.800]   Charming Doctor. - That's not really the next one.
[01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:29.120]   - Doctor Ivan Hirschkopf, Paul Rudd,
[01:20:29.120 --> 01:20:32.400]   takes, slowly takes over the life of his patient,
[01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:34.480]   Martin Markowitz, played by Will Ferrell.
[01:20:34.480 --> 01:20:36.400]   Okay, this is the Will Ferrell,
[01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:39.600]   eight part limited series that comes out in November.
[01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:41.520]   There's very few movies that Will Ferrell
[01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:43.320]   and Paul Rudd have been in that I don't like.
[01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:46.800]   - Yeah, that's a good, they're gonna get me on this one,
[01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:48.560]   I think. - Yeah.
[01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:53.060]   - So notice every month they've got a new premiere.
[01:20:53.060 --> 01:21:00.400]   There's a multi-season one hour single issue
[01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:05.400]   John Stewart series that will come out in the fall.
[01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:09.000]   Some details are sort of scant on that.
[01:21:09.680 --> 01:21:13.480]   A combination podcast and video documentary limited series
[01:21:13.480 --> 01:21:16.200]   called The Line, you get the podcast now.
[01:21:16.200 --> 01:21:19.760]   It's a, this is the beginning of that process
[01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:22.440]   that I think is gonna be interesting is podcasts,
[01:21:22.440 --> 01:21:25.400]   for instance, that are part of the show of execution.
[01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:26.920]   And I think you'll see more and more of that.
[01:21:26.920 --> 01:21:28.560]   - Absolutely agree with it.
[01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:32.520]   That's about a Navy seal charged with committing war crimes
[01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:35.440]   before being acquitted ultimately.
[01:21:35.440 --> 01:21:37.200]   That's non-fiction.
[01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:39.320]   Foundation will come out.
[01:21:39.320 --> 01:21:40.840]   - Can't wait. - We don't know.
[01:21:40.840 --> 01:21:43.800]   It says 2021, sometime this year.
[01:21:43.800 --> 01:21:44.640]   - Yep.
[01:21:44.640 --> 01:21:46.400]   - I can't wait either.
[01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:47.640]   We've seen the trailers.
[01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:50.280]   It's, you know, it's funny.
[01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:55.280]   In my mind foundation is not this giant Star Wars-ish
[01:21:55.280 --> 01:21:57.080]   production. - It's ineffable, right?
[01:21:57.080 --> 01:21:59.480]   - Yeah, and so I have mixed feelings
[01:21:59.480 --> 01:22:01.600]   after seeing the trailers about whether
[01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:03.280]   I'm gonna be happy about this.
[01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:04.840]   - It's like dude, it's not the book,
[01:22:04.840 --> 01:22:05.840]   but I love the book so much.
[01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:06.680]   - It's not the book, but it's--
[01:22:06.680 --> 01:22:07.640]   - Enjoy watching it.
[01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:09.280]   - That's a good way to put it.
[01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:12.200]   - Yeah, it's unfortunate that everybody really wants to,
[01:22:12.200 --> 01:22:15.680]   the MCU model has been so, so successful.
[01:22:15.680 --> 01:22:18.360]   You can't blame another studio or another company
[01:22:18.360 --> 01:22:21.440]   for trying to copy it, but sometimes there are properties
[01:22:21.440 --> 01:22:24.240]   that, wow, if you take the four books that were written
[01:22:24.240 --> 01:22:27.880]   and they're good, but you can create a single
[01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:30.760]   two and a half hour movie that's exceptional and great,
[01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:32.600]   sometimes that's the way to go.
[01:22:32.600 --> 01:22:34.440]   And you see that, oh God, we're gonna,
[01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:35.560]   are we gonna have to, like,
[01:22:35.560 --> 01:22:38.120]   the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy could have,
[01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:41.160]   you really can't make it into an epic universe.
[01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:44.920]   You have to decide that you've got six books worth of story
[01:22:44.920 --> 01:22:46.760]   and figure out which two or three movies
[01:22:46.760 --> 01:22:48.320]   you wanna make out of those things.
[01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:50.360]   I mean, I was so thrilled to,
[01:22:50.360 --> 01:22:52.800]   you have properties like Sandman where God,
[01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:54.560]   it would have been impossible to try to make
[01:22:54.560 --> 01:22:55.400]   a feature film out of it,
[01:22:55.400 --> 01:22:57.080]   which they've been trying to do for decades,
[01:22:57.080 --> 01:23:00.520]   but Hitchhiker's, it really does want to be compressed,
[01:23:00.520 --> 01:23:03.040]   it really does wanna have some scaffolding,
[01:23:03.040 --> 01:23:05.360]   some extra internal support put into it,
[01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:06.920]   so it holds together.
[01:23:06.920 --> 01:23:08.880]   And I'm surprised that we haven't seen,
[01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:10.880]   I haven't heard of a serious attempt
[01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:12.520]   to take that property and turn it into,
[01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:14.840]   like, a series of feature films.
[01:23:14.840 --> 01:23:16.840]   Excuse me, feature streaming films right now.
[01:23:16.840 --> 01:23:18.320]   - Yeah.
[01:23:18.320 --> 01:23:22.160]   So Apple TV, it's not free anymore.
[01:23:22.160 --> 01:23:25.560]   They're that confident right now.
[01:23:25.560 --> 01:23:28.680]   - Oh, wow, they must really feel like they got some stuff.
[01:23:28.680 --> 01:23:30.680]   - We've got Ted Lasso, we can start charging now.
[01:23:30.680 --> 01:23:32.800]   - Nor will you, nor will you get it,
[01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:34.520]   you won't get a year anymore
[01:23:34.520 --> 01:23:37.080]   when you buy an Apple device, what is it, three months?
[01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:40.560]   Starting next month, I think, three months free.
[01:23:40.560 --> 01:23:43.000]   But those of us who've been getting it free for the last,
[01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.240]   God, it seems forever.
[01:23:45.240 --> 01:23:48.160]   We're gonna have to start paying up pretty soon.
[01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:50.320]   Somebody else has swallowed an AirPod.
[01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:55.160]   - They're souls.
[01:23:55.160 --> 01:23:56.840]   - I can't believe this story.
[01:23:56.840 --> 01:23:59.440]   It's like, if you, so the story is that,
[01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:00.840]   hey, like the post-group was,
[01:24:00.840 --> 01:24:03.480]   "Hey, and it worked when it was retrained."
[01:24:03.480 --> 01:24:04.920]   - Whoa, retrained. - The person put it back
[01:24:04.920 --> 01:24:05.760]   in your ear.
[01:24:05.760 --> 01:24:06.840]   - And I'm like, you know what?
[01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:10.880]   I got another $160 to spend on a new pair of AirPods.
[01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:13.040]   I don't need to know that it still,
[01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:14.400]   how do they find out it still works?
[01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:15.400]   That's all I gotta know.
[01:24:15.400 --> 01:24:16.480]   I don't know, I don't wanna know.
[01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:18.360]   - The funny thing is, the Guardian has done this
[01:24:18.360 --> 01:24:22.840]   in first person, it's Brad Couchier.
[01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:25.200]   He was watching, he was exhausted,
[01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:28.120]   but he likes to watch movies on his phone as he goes to sleep.
[01:24:28.120 --> 01:24:30.880]   He put on the 1980s version of The Things
[01:24:30.880 --> 01:24:32.200]   during Kurt Russell.
[01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:34.600]   - Good choice.
[01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:36.160]   - Did you say good or bad?
[01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:37.640]   - Good choice. - Good choice.
[01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:39.600]   - Well, not if you wanna fall asleep,
[01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:42.640]   if you wanna like be in bed with a nice turned off
[01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:45.280]   and with a baseball bat, then yeah, it's a great choice.
[01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:48.400]   - They, you know, the people who stay over in Antarctica,
[01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:49.400]   stay over through the winter,
[01:24:49.400 --> 01:24:52.640]   and it's only a few dozen people at most.
[01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:55.360]   At tradition, once the last plane leaves,
[01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:59.640]   and they're locked in for the over winter in the Antarctica,
[01:24:59.640 --> 01:25:02.680]   they do a marathon of all the thing movies
[01:25:02.680 --> 01:25:05.160]   because the thing takes place in Antarctica.
[01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:08.040]   - I don't suppose that they're looking for people
[01:25:08.040 --> 01:25:11.600]   who are particularly normal to take those jobs.
[01:25:11.600 --> 01:25:13.440]   Probably absolutely correct.
[01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:16.200]   If you're perfectly normal, you're not gonna do well.
[01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:18.680]   - A thing, marathon, because in fact,
[01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:20.840]   it doesn't the thing take over the research station
[01:25:20.840 --> 01:25:23.560]   in Antarctica and brutally murder everybody?
[01:25:23.560 --> 01:25:26.600]   I think that's in horrifying body power.
[01:25:26.600 --> 01:25:28.680]   - Perfect detail, yeah.
[01:25:28.680 --> 01:25:32.320]   Anyway, poor David here when he's, or Brad, rather,
[01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:33.720]   he's watching the thing.
[01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:37.240]   He says, "Within 10 minutes, I could barely keep my eyes open.
[01:25:37.240 --> 01:25:39.480]   "The next thing I knew four hours had passed.
[01:25:39.480 --> 01:25:41.600]   "My wife was still asleep, the movie long finished.
[01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:44.080]   "Grogly, I moved my iPhone off the pillow,
[01:25:44.080 --> 01:25:46.440]   "removed the wireless AirPod headphone from one ear,
[01:25:46.440 --> 01:25:49.840]   "the other had fallen out, and I couldn't find it.
[01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:53.600]   "I padded to the bathroom for a sip of water,
[01:25:53.600 --> 01:25:55.360]   "but couldn't swallow properly.
[01:25:55.360 --> 01:25:58.080]   "My throat filled with water, but it wouldn't go down.
[01:25:58.080 --> 01:26:00.000]   "I had to lean over the sink and let the water drain out.
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:03.240]   "It was bizarre and alarming, but I was so tired
[01:26:03.240 --> 01:26:04.640]   "that I just went back to bed."
[01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:06.320]   Okay, first mistake.
[01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:08.440]   Yeah, maybe second mistake.
[01:26:08.440 --> 01:26:10.560]   In the morning, I checked again for the missing earbud,
[01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:11.920]   but it was nowhere to be seen.
[01:26:11.920 --> 01:26:15.440]   The Find My AirPod function didn't work
[01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:16.600]   'cause the batteries were flat.
[01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:19.560]   Oh, too bad, I was hoping his stomach would beep.
[01:26:19.560 --> 01:26:21.280]   Lots more snow had fallen overnight.
[01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:22.800]   I went out, blah, blah, blah.
[01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:23.800]   Has anyone seen it?
[01:26:23.800 --> 01:26:25.160]   No, no, no.
[01:26:25.160 --> 01:26:27.120]   His son Owen said, "Hey, maybe dad,
[01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:28.320]   "maybe you swallowed it."
[01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:29.760]   (laughs)
[01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:32.360]   A couple of minutes later, another mouthful of water
[01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:33.400]   came straight back up.
[01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:36.240]   We started to wonder if it might be onto something.
[01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:38.120]   I'd also become aware of faint pressure
[01:26:38.120 --> 01:26:40.320]   in the middle of my chest.
[01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:42.040]   He goes to the doctor.
[01:26:42.040 --> 01:26:47.320]   The doctor gives him an X-ray.
[01:26:47.320 --> 01:26:49.840]   The doctor's expression when she returned was priceless.
[01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:52.160]   "Well, I'll be damned," she said.
[01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:53.600]   "She led me to her workstation,
[01:26:53.600 --> 01:26:55.640]   "which was surrounded by medical staff."
[01:26:55.640 --> 01:26:57.080]   (laughs)
[01:26:57.080 --> 01:26:59.720]   On the screen was a cartoon clear image of my ribs
[01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:02.640]   and parked in between them at 45 degrees.
[01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:07.000]   The unmistakable shape of the missing AirPod
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:08.800]   webbed into his esophagus.
[01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:14.600]   They went to, he got an endoscope
[01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:17.240]   and the AirPod was retrieved via endoscope
[01:27:17.240 --> 01:27:20.960]   with a tube with a lasso, a Ted lasso attachment.
[01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:24.440]   It was extremely uncomfortable,
[01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:26.280]   but I was sedated in only half a week.
[01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:28.160]   He was given the AirPod a neat little bag.
[01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:29.600]   So yeah, he didn't poop it.
[01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:32.560]   He just stored it in his esophagus for a while.
[01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:35.080]   It works fine, although the microphone
[01:27:35.080 --> 01:27:36.600]   is less reliable.
[01:27:36.600 --> 01:27:43.040]   First person story, man, another man eats an AirPod.
[01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:46.120]   Please, kids, don't go to sleep with the AirPods in.
[01:27:46.120 --> 01:27:49.000]   I'm at least now a little bit less embarrassed
[01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:52.400]   that I still have my AirPods charging case,
[01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:54.120]   but I've lost both of the AirPods.
[01:27:54.120 --> 01:27:57.120]   I lost one of the AirBuds for my Sony
[01:27:57.120 --> 01:27:59.080]   True Wireless AirBuds.
[01:27:59.080 --> 01:28:00.600]   I'm a little bit embarrassed,
[01:28:00.600 --> 01:28:02.880]   less embarrassed that I cannot keep the,
[01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:05.080]   keep track of these things for more than six years ago.
[01:28:05.080 --> 01:28:05.920]   - I feel bad.
[01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:10.000]   Lisa wore her AirPod pros to bed one night, went to bed.
[01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.680]   Next morning, I changed the sheets,
[01:28:12.680 --> 01:28:14.320]   and apparently they were in the sheets
[01:28:14.320 --> 01:28:15.920]   and I threw the whole thing in the wash
[01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:17.560]   and they got laundered.
[01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:19.040]   So now I've worked on that.
[01:28:19.040 --> 01:28:20.920]   - I take off the sheets, I shake 'em out.
[01:28:20.920 --> 01:28:23.680]   (laughing)
[01:28:23.680 --> 01:28:26.120]   - I'm impressed by people who can keep track of those
[01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:29.320]   until for all like 21 years.
[01:28:29.320 --> 01:28:31.280]   For all 21 months until the battery dies,
[01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:32.320]   they have to buy a brand new one.
[01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:34.600]   - That's why when I bought the AirPod Pro Max,
[01:28:34.600 --> 01:28:35.880]   which of course, these are the headphones,
[01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:36.720]   you're not gonna lose them.
[01:28:36.720 --> 01:28:38.240]   You're certainly not gonna swallow them,
[01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:39.840]   but I did get them in hot pink,
[01:28:39.840 --> 01:28:42.120]   so they'll be easy to spot.
[01:28:42.120 --> 01:28:47.720]   Let's see, Apple's launching.
[01:28:47.720 --> 01:28:52.720]   This is for you, Mr. Alex Lindsey, a new AR experience
[01:28:52.920 --> 01:28:57.920]   and Snapchat lens promoting Apple Pay Express Transit.
[01:28:57.920 --> 01:29:02.560]   - Oh good, I could put a giant transit kiosk
[01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:04.400]   in the turnstime middle of my--
[01:29:04.400 --> 01:29:05.240]   - Turnstime.
[01:29:05.240 --> 01:29:06.080]   (laughing)
[01:29:06.080 --> 01:29:07.600]   - I am living room.
[01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:10.120]   - So you can visualize it.
[01:29:10.120 --> 01:29:11.840]   You can visualize what it would be like to--
[01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:14.880]   - Take a virtual trip with Apple in the day.
[01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:17.960]   - Wow, once you're inside the AR experience in your iPhone,
[01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:20.680]   you could tap your iPhone in a New York City turnstile
[01:29:20.680 --> 01:29:23.000]   to enter a virtual augmented reality experience
[01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:26.640]   that simulates a sub-ray ride from Brooklyn to Manhattan,
[01:29:26.640 --> 01:29:28.760]   including the views of the New York City skyline.
[01:29:28.760 --> 01:29:30.120]   Too bad they don't have smell-a-vision.
[01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:31.280]   - You know, is this the new and you haven't--
[01:29:31.280 --> 01:29:32.640]   - Is that what we're talking about?
[01:29:32.640 --> 01:29:34.120]   - It sure feels like it.
[01:29:34.120 --> 01:29:36.200]   - Well, I haven't used this one yet.
[01:29:36.200 --> 01:29:37.160]   I mean, I haven't played with it yet.
[01:29:37.160 --> 01:29:38.680]   I saw it in the links, I couldn't get it to,
[01:29:38.680 --> 01:29:40.440]   I just was not right phone.
[01:29:40.440 --> 01:29:45.440]   Anyway, so, but I think it's interesting
[01:29:45.440 --> 01:29:49.520]   to be able to visualize what you have to do to do something.
[01:29:49.520 --> 01:29:52.160]   And so the idea of being able to use AR to,
[01:29:52.160 --> 01:29:53.920]   I think that's the idea here is not so much
[01:29:53.920 --> 01:29:56.440]   whether it's to actually use the subway,
[01:29:56.440 --> 01:29:59.920]   but to do something that requires a series of steps
[01:29:59.920 --> 01:30:02.360]   that we can visually, before you get there,
[01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:03.800]   you can visualize seeing it.
[01:30:03.800 --> 01:30:07.480]   If you look at, in some cases, when people have,
[01:30:07.480 --> 01:30:10.120]   when there's just so many things that we do
[01:30:10.120 --> 01:30:12.960]   that we pre-visualize how that's going to work,
[01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:14.760]   and we practice it, and we think about it.
[01:30:14.760 --> 01:30:15.600]   And sometimes-- - Yes, that's how I--
[01:30:15.600 --> 01:30:16.440]   - Sometimes one thing's-- - Sometimes one thing's,
[01:30:16.440 --> 01:30:17.720]   that's true, I rehearse it.
[01:30:17.720 --> 01:30:19.920]   - Yeah, well, I mean, I think that sometimes though,
[01:30:19.920 --> 01:30:23.080]   I know that it's stressful for folks around travel,
[01:30:23.080 --> 01:30:24.840]   and so on, so forth, of knowing what it's going to be like,
[01:30:24.840 --> 01:30:27.320]   and where am I supposed to go, and how am I supposed to do it?
[01:30:27.320 --> 01:30:28.800]   And I know that if I go to an airport,
[01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:30.560]   I'm always like, okay, I don't know where to go,
[01:30:30.560 --> 01:30:31.960]   and how this is going to look.
[01:30:31.960 --> 01:30:36.040]   But I think that that might be the case of,
[01:30:36.040 --> 01:30:38.080]   I know that I avoided the Bay Area,
[01:30:38.080 --> 01:30:40.720]   Bay Area, Rapid Transit, or whatever,
[01:30:40.720 --> 01:30:43.080]   for years because I just didn't know how it worked.
[01:30:43.080 --> 01:30:44.640]   I was like, oh, I'll just drive.
[01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:46.560]   Once I started using it, I was like, that was crazy.
[01:30:46.560 --> 01:30:47.440]   This was so much easier.
[01:30:47.440 --> 01:30:49.120]   Like, why would I ever let it go to a point
[01:30:49.120 --> 01:30:50.960]   where you never drive, you never drive into the city?
[01:30:50.960 --> 01:30:51.920]   You always take part.
[01:30:51.920 --> 01:30:54.360]   So I think it just depends on getting people over a hump,
[01:30:54.360 --> 01:30:55.920]   I think makes sense.
[01:30:55.920 --> 01:31:00.920]   - So it's kind of a, I have now, I am now in the New York City.
[01:31:00.920 --> 01:31:01.760]   How are you going to see this?
[01:31:01.760 --> 01:31:03.080]   Can you see this over my shoulder, Andy?
[01:31:03.080 --> 01:31:05.440]   - Can you put it to the Apple TV?
[01:31:05.440 --> 01:31:07.520]   - Yeah, I can airplay it, sure.
[01:31:07.520 --> 01:31:09.320]   I've put a New York City subway station
[01:31:09.320 --> 01:31:10.600]   in the middle of our studio.
[01:31:10.600 --> 01:31:12.040]   Oh, the doors are opening.
[01:31:12.040 --> 01:31:14.760]   Let's hop inside, come on in, Burke.
[01:31:14.760 --> 01:31:16.200]   Wow, that is.
[01:31:16.200 --> 01:31:18.880]   But if you want to do it yourself,
[01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:21.960]   you go to the Apple Pay website with your iPhone,
[01:31:21.960 --> 01:31:24.600]   transit.applepay.apple.
[01:31:24.600 --> 01:31:27.160]   Oh, I didn't know they have.apple.
[01:31:27.160 --> 01:31:29.200]   They've got.apple.
[01:31:29.200 --> 01:31:31.160]   Did you know they had.apple?
[01:31:31.160 --> 01:31:32.000]   No.
[01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:33.200]   - How does that even work?
[01:31:33.200 --> 01:31:37.400]   - Ah, they pay, you pay like $150,000 to ICANN.
[01:31:37.400 --> 01:31:38.240]   - Hey Pete.
[01:31:38.240 --> 01:31:39.080]   - Yeah.
[01:31:39.080 --> 01:31:40.920]   - And Pete the food industry?
[01:31:40.920 --> 01:31:42.680]   - Applepay.apple.
[01:31:42.680 --> 01:31:44.520]   I had no idea.
[01:31:44.520 --> 01:31:47.120]   So then when you get in there with your iPhone,
[01:31:47.120 --> 01:31:48.800]   or I guess it would work with an iPad,
[01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:51.280]   you'll be able to--
[01:31:51.280 --> 01:31:52.840]   - I mean, it's lovely.
[01:31:52.840 --> 01:31:54.160]   - Especially with losses.
[01:31:54.160 --> 01:31:55.480]   - Yeah.
[01:31:55.480 --> 01:31:56.600]   I take Alex's point.
[01:31:56.600 --> 01:31:58.480]   I just don't know if this is the best example of that.
[01:31:58.480 --> 01:32:01.440]   I don't know that that's better than just simply having
[01:32:01.440 --> 01:32:04.320]   like a 2D experience where you can navigate
[01:32:04.320 --> 01:32:06.280]   like it's a video game.
[01:32:06.280 --> 01:32:09.160]   I'm trying to imagine holding the phone
[01:32:09.160 --> 01:32:12.400]   is the thing I need to tap to get through that archway.
[01:32:12.400 --> 01:32:15.000]   I'm trying to figure out how much,
[01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:18.800]   whether it would be easier for me to envision that
[01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:21.480]   with having to look at this phone and keep the way the phone
[01:32:21.480 --> 01:32:23.080]   is not only the tool that I'm using,
[01:32:23.080 --> 01:32:25.880]   but it's also my view on what I'm actually doing
[01:32:25.880 --> 01:32:27.520]   versus here, fine.
[01:32:27.520 --> 01:32:30.760]   Here is a VR, here is a, not even a VR,
[01:32:30.760 --> 01:32:33.760]   but like a gamified version of this kiosk.
[01:32:33.760 --> 01:32:35.200]   You've got your phone in your hand.
[01:32:35.200 --> 01:32:36.280]   Here's what you're gonna see.
[01:32:36.280 --> 01:32:38.480]   You wanna zoom in and take a look at what that touchpad
[01:32:38.480 --> 01:32:39.320]   looks like.
[01:32:39.320 --> 01:32:40.160]   Here's what it looks like.
[01:32:40.160 --> 01:32:42.040]   Here's what the display, the confirmation display
[01:32:42.040 --> 01:32:44.480]   on that kiosk is gonna look like.
[01:32:44.480 --> 01:32:47.240]   I wasn't really impressed with this
[01:32:47.240 --> 01:32:50.480]   because it just really felt like Apple trying really,
[01:32:50.480 --> 01:32:54.240]   really hard to make AR a thing without yet making
[01:32:54.240 --> 01:32:55.240]   the real case for it.
[01:32:55.240 --> 01:32:57.280]   It reminded me, actually now that I think of it,
[01:32:57.280 --> 01:32:59.600]   it reminded me of the first examples they were giving
[01:32:59.600 --> 01:33:02.400]   of QuickTime where they were showing me,
[01:33:02.400 --> 01:33:05.280]   oh look, now when you have a word processing document,
[01:33:05.280 --> 01:33:08.280]   you can have a video of a rocket launching in the middle
[01:33:08.280 --> 01:33:10.600]   of, as in the place of a paragraph.
[01:33:10.600 --> 01:33:12.400]   And well, I have never wanted to do that.
[01:33:12.400 --> 01:33:14.600]   And I don't know how many copies of this page
[01:33:14.600 --> 01:33:17.000]   are gonna have to print to make the animation come through.
[01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.160]   I mean, and for that reason, it took me a little while
[01:33:19.160 --> 01:33:20.880]   before I realized exactly what a big thing
[01:33:20.880 --> 01:33:22.080]   QuickTime actually was.
[01:33:22.080 --> 01:33:24.160]   I think that Apple's in the same place
[01:33:24.160 --> 01:33:26.240]   but they are right now where this is nice.
[01:33:26.240 --> 01:33:27.520]   It's a nice technology demo.
[01:33:27.520 --> 01:33:28.360]   It's fun.
[01:33:28.360 --> 01:33:31.200]   I'm just not sure if I'm just trying to teach people
[01:33:31.200 --> 01:33:33.280]   to get more accustomed to here's what's gonna be like
[01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:35.240]   to navigate the New York City subway system.
[01:33:35.240 --> 01:33:37.680]   I'm not sure that that would be the most advisable,
[01:33:37.680 --> 01:33:40.760]   most rich experience they can give them.
[01:33:40.760 --> 01:33:44.040]   - Well, you know what, there's times, for instance,
[01:33:44.040 --> 01:33:47.480]   when I've arrived at airports in foreign lands
[01:33:47.480 --> 01:33:52.240]   like Dubai or Cairo, where I think it'd be kind of cool
[01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:54.600]   just to kind of know what my path is gonna be
[01:33:54.600 --> 01:33:56.680]   getting off the airplane and walk through it.
[01:33:56.680 --> 01:33:58.840]   I think that would be kind of neat.
[01:33:58.840 --> 01:34:01.800]   - But that's a very specific limited use.
[01:34:01.800 --> 01:34:05.000]   - But would it be better with, I mean, we all, I'm sure,
[01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.360]   before I go to a different city,
[01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:08.920]   I will, if I'm going someplace,
[01:34:08.920 --> 01:34:11.920]   I will use Google Street View and actually walk through a route
[01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:13.040]   from one place to another.
[01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:13.880]   - Exactly.
[01:34:13.880 --> 01:34:16.080]   - And I don't think that AR would make that any better
[01:34:16.080 --> 01:34:18.920]   than simply having a flat experience in front of me
[01:34:18.920 --> 01:34:21.240]   if I'm just trying to familiar myself with way of good.
[01:34:21.240 --> 01:34:22.840]   - Yeah, I'm just trying to look, yeah, exactly.
[01:34:22.840 --> 01:34:24.800]   'Cause I can't read the signs and stuff.
[01:34:24.800 --> 01:34:27.160]   I mean, this is really what are kind of,
[01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:30.240]   what's cool about having handheld technology
[01:34:30.240 --> 01:34:33.040]   is you know, you can read, now you can read signs
[01:34:33.040 --> 01:34:33.880]   in other languages.
[01:34:33.880 --> 01:34:35.520]   - All the whole Fox around the streets.
[01:34:35.520 --> 01:34:36.840]   - Yeah, yep.
[01:34:36.840 --> 01:34:38.920]   - Oh, god, no, another, Google, that's not the problem
[01:34:38.920 --> 01:34:41.080]   with Google, they give us these great demos
[01:34:41.080 --> 01:34:43.280]   at Google AIO, but they don't actually,
[01:34:43.280 --> 01:34:45.000]   I'm waiting for my damn Fox,
[01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.440]   I wanna follow my Fox throughout the street.
[01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:49.160]   And I wanna be able to take a picture through
[01:34:49.160 --> 01:34:51.360]   with Chainlink fence and have the Chainlink fence go away.
[01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:53.720]   How about that four or five years later?
[01:34:53.720 --> 01:34:54.560]   Sorry.
[01:34:54.560 --> 01:34:55.760]   (laughing)
[01:34:55.760 --> 01:34:57.680]   - I think we can do that.
[01:34:57.680 --> 01:35:01.320]   Sonos is pissed off.
[01:35:01.320 --> 01:35:03.560]   I'm sorry, Sonos.
[01:35:03.560 --> 01:35:05.720]   - We're about Apple adding Siri to third parties
[01:35:05.720 --> 01:35:07.600]   using HomePod.
[01:35:07.600 --> 01:35:10.600]   There, this is just, I get another company saying,
[01:35:10.600 --> 01:35:14.120]   you know, you really ought to regulate these guys.
[01:35:14.120 --> 01:35:16.400]   - Only, they're not big enough to throw their way
[01:35:16.400 --> 01:35:19.520]   to run like Facebook and Apple can
[01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:22.400]   when they're facing stuff that they don't like.
[01:35:22.400 --> 01:35:24.320]   I don't know, it's such a cheap thing to do.
[01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:27.720]   They're not, Apple is not even baking Siri
[01:35:27.720 --> 01:35:28.840]   directly into these devices.
[01:35:28.840 --> 01:35:31.000]   They're just simply allowing these devices
[01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:34.280]   to act as a microphone that passes something
[01:35:34.280 --> 01:35:37.360]   onto a Siri power to Apple device
[01:35:37.360 --> 01:35:38.720]   at some place on the network.
[01:35:38.720 --> 01:35:40.200]   So it's just sad.
[01:35:40.200 --> 01:35:44.720]   - The Sonos' chief counsel is testifying
[01:35:44.720 --> 01:35:46.800]   in front of Congress right now
[01:35:46.800 --> 01:35:49.400]   in the hearing titled Protecting Competition
[01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:52.760]   and Innovation and Home Technologies.
[01:35:52.760 --> 01:35:56.000]   Eddie Lazarus, Sonos chief legal officer says,
[01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:00.200]   "The battle for the future of the smart home is upon us."
[01:36:00.200 --> 01:36:02.640]   - This is from the company who basically killed off
[01:36:02.640 --> 01:36:05.840]   their earlier generation while everyone still owned it.
[01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:09.360]   Like, this is exactly why we shouldn't get dig too far
[01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:12.040]   into Apple is because Apple doesn't do that.
[01:36:12.040 --> 01:36:14.760]   You know, and as a user, like, I would never,
[01:36:14.760 --> 01:36:17.840]   I mean, I have 14 Sonos amps that don't work.
[01:36:17.840 --> 01:36:20.000]   So I'm not gonna buy anymore Sonos,
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:21.280]   like I'm not updating it.
[01:36:21.280 --> 01:36:23.520]   You know, and so I, you know, that's the,
[01:36:23.520 --> 01:36:26.800]   but that's also why as a user, you know,
[01:36:26.800 --> 01:36:28.840]   I think that we talk about competition
[01:36:28.840 --> 01:36:31.720]   and I think that we need to keep on going back to
[01:36:31.720 --> 01:36:35.600]   what is the user's right to have a seamless experience.
[01:36:35.600 --> 01:36:37.720]   You know, like, and the thing is, is that we're buying,
[01:36:37.720 --> 01:36:39.480]   we're buying into the ecosystem.
[01:36:39.480 --> 01:36:40.840]   We're the ones paying for it.
[01:36:40.840 --> 01:36:43.480]   Like, we paid for the hardware, we paid for the software
[01:36:43.480 --> 01:36:45.560]   and we have an expectation as a user
[01:36:45.560 --> 01:36:47.600]   to have a certain level of experience.
[01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:51.240]   And these bozos in DC wanna try to basically
[01:36:51.240 --> 01:36:53.040]   take it away from us and make it,
[01:36:53.040 --> 01:36:55.800]   in the name of competition, it's what it's gonna do
[01:36:55.800 --> 01:36:57.040]   is it's gonna fragment the market
[01:36:57.040 --> 01:36:59.240]   and it's gonna make everything harder for us as the user
[01:36:59.240 --> 01:37:01.960]   because they have some high and mighty plan for this,
[01:37:01.960 --> 01:37:03.720]   for this thing that isn't gonna work because, you know,
[01:37:03.720 --> 01:37:05.040]   it never does.
[01:37:05.040 --> 01:37:06.400]   You know, fragmenting the market
[01:37:06.400 --> 01:37:08.320]   never makes it better for the user.
[01:37:08.320 --> 01:37:11.600]   - Yeah. Also, Google was able to acquire a mapping company
[01:37:11.600 --> 01:37:13.920]   back when no one was interested in digital mapping.
[01:37:13.920 --> 01:37:18.080]   As a result, we're no longer spending $50 per month
[01:37:18.080 --> 01:37:19.960]   for access to street level maps.
[01:37:19.960 --> 01:37:21.880]   We get this, everybody gets it for free.
[01:37:21.880 --> 01:37:25.640]   And that's benefited business, that's benefited individuals.
[01:37:25.640 --> 01:37:28.800]   And for them to decide that that was a bad idea,
[01:37:28.800 --> 01:37:30.120]   that example was not a bad idea.
[01:37:30.120 --> 01:37:31.800]   That was a very, very consumer
[01:37:31.800 --> 01:37:34.080]   and naturally business positive for everybody.
[01:37:34.080 --> 01:37:39.960]   - A German Apple fan has decided to make
[01:37:39.960 --> 01:37:43.400]   absolutely perfect reproductions
[01:37:43.400 --> 01:37:47.760]   of the Apple One operation manual from scratch,
[01:37:47.760 --> 01:37:49.680]   his YouTube video.
[01:37:49.680 --> 01:37:52.360]   He is retroplace on YouTube,
[01:37:52.360 --> 01:37:55.600]   recreating the Apple One operation manual.
[01:37:55.600 --> 01:38:02.000]   - Wow, that is, here's to the crazy one.
[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.920]   - So apparently he has a kind of poor quality scan,
[01:38:04.920 --> 01:38:07.120]   which is pixelized.
[01:38:07.120 --> 01:38:12.040]   So he's going through it carefully adding,
[01:38:12.040 --> 01:38:13.520]   he found the right font, I guess,
[01:38:13.520 --> 01:38:14.720]   which is a typewriter font,
[01:38:14.720 --> 01:38:18.360]   and he's carefully adding, even curning it to match.
[01:38:20.040 --> 01:38:25.040]   So that we can someday, you too, can have a perfect reproduction.
[01:38:25.040 --> 01:38:28.040]   - This problem is, a lot of us would buy that.
[01:38:28.040 --> 01:38:28.880]   (laughing)
[01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:31.320]   - No, I didn't buy it, but it's like,
[01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:35.200]   for me, that's like a coffee table book.
[01:38:35.200 --> 01:38:36.040]   (laughing)
[01:38:36.040 --> 01:38:38.320]   Like to have the actual manual perfect,
[01:38:38.320 --> 01:38:41.080]   and be able to say, oh, it was perfectly, yeah.
[01:38:41.080 --> 01:38:42.640]   - Yeah, he says it was--
[01:38:42.640 --> 01:38:43.640]   - It's actually quite variable, I think.
[01:38:43.640 --> 01:38:46.000]   - It was, well, it was apparently written on an IBM
[01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.880]   Selectric with a proportional font and ball,
[01:38:48.880 --> 01:38:53.880]   so it has to be manually curd the whole way.
[01:38:53.880 --> 01:38:56.360]   - You can't just machine learn this whole thing.
[01:38:56.360 --> 01:38:58.200]   - Oh, look at him, he's getting all of the--
[01:38:58.200 --> 01:38:59.040]   - He's doing the one.
[01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:00.120]   - And this is sped up, by the way,
[01:39:00.120 --> 01:39:02.200]   I think it was much slower than this.
[01:39:02.200 --> 01:39:04.720]   Slow, what app is this that he's using?
[01:39:04.720 --> 01:39:05.560]   Is it Photoshop?
[01:39:05.560 --> 01:39:06.400]   - He hates it, is it?
[01:39:06.400 --> 01:39:07.240]   - It's like Photoshop.
[01:39:07.240 --> 01:39:08.440]   - I don't know. - It's like Photoshop.
[01:39:08.440 --> 01:39:09.440]   - Yeah.
[01:39:09.440 --> 01:39:10.760]   Good Lord.
[01:39:10.760 --> 01:39:11.600]   (laughing)
[01:39:11.600 --> 01:39:14.720]   - You know, there's great power to the artifact.
[01:39:14.720 --> 01:39:17.080]   You're not just the tech, so you're not just,
[01:39:17.080 --> 01:39:18.680]   "Hey, here's here, it's like a cut and paste,
[01:39:18.680 --> 01:39:22.200]   "I've done a scan," but here is something that is as close
[01:39:22.200 --> 01:39:24.880]   to holding the actual artifact in your hand as you can.
[01:39:24.880 --> 01:39:28.440]   It really does mess with your mind in a very, very positive way.
[01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:29.480]   And I'm glad that he's doing this.
[01:39:29.480 --> 01:39:33.160]   I hope that I hope that he releases this under Creative Commons
[01:39:33.160 --> 01:39:37.000]   or something, because this is the sort of thing that,
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:40.560]   when I'm not, I can't afford like original props
[01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:43.160]   and original things like that, but there are times when,
[01:39:43.160 --> 01:39:46.240]   like, you're at a bookstore and you open,
[01:39:46.240 --> 01:39:48.160]   like, an early edition of a book and you find out,
[01:39:48.160 --> 01:39:50.440]   "Oh, this one was actually signed by Douglas Adams
[01:39:50.440 --> 01:39:51.840]   "and I'm curious either, oh, at some point,
[01:39:51.840 --> 01:39:53.760]   " Douglas Adams actually held this book
[01:39:53.760 --> 01:39:55.720]   "and put his pen mark in it."
[01:39:55.720 --> 01:39:56.880]   That's some powerful mojo.
[01:39:56.880 --> 01:39:58.360]   That really triggers the imagination.
[01:39:58.360 --> 01:39:59.200]   - They're not cheap.
[01:39:59.200 --> 01:40:04.200]   You can buy the entire set for $117.75 at RetroPlace.com.
[01:40:04.200 --> 01:40:06.480]   - I got that on me.
[01:40:06.480 --> 01:40:09.120]   - Calm. (laughing)
[01:40:09.120 --> 01:40:10.600]   Look at that.
[01:40:10.600 --> 01:40:13.120]   That is pretty darn cool.
[01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:14.440]   - That is such a sad example.
[01:40:14.440 --> 01:40:15.520]   - Oh, this is a cassette interface, yeah.
[01:40:15.520 --> 01:40:16.360]   - Oh, my God.
[01:40:16.360 --> 01:40:17.200]   - Look at that.
[01:40:17.200 --> 01:40:18.520]   And here's an ad.
[01:40:18.520 --> 01:40:21.600]   This is really cool.
[01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:22.600]   This is really cool.
[01:40:22.600 --> 01:40:23.920]   Yeah. - Yeah, that was.
[01:40:23.920 --> 01:40:25.240]   - RetroPlace, yeah.
[01:40:25.240 --> 01:40:26.320]   That's a, you know what?
[01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:28.560]   He deserves that money, 99 euros,
[01:40:28.560 --> 01:40:30.200]   'cause that's a lot of work.
[01:40:30.200 --> 01:40:31.040]   - Yeah.
[01:40:31.040 --> 01:40:33.320]   Everybody has a passion about one thing.
[01:40:33.320 --> 01:40:34.600]   And everybody has this one thing
[01:40:34.600 --> 01:40:36.960]   that they have the patience to actually endure
[01:40:36.960 --> 01:40:38.280]   and make it right.
[01:40:38.280 --> 01:40:40.400]   And this person decided that we need an accurate
[01:40:40.400 --> 01:40:41.560]   reproduction of this manual,
[01:40:41.560 --> 01:40:43.400]   which didn't, which wouldn't have existed,
[01:40:43.400 --> 01:40:45.880]   had he not had this passion and this determination
[01:40:45.880 --> 01:40:47.400]   for other people's gonna be something else.
[01:40:47.400 --> 01:40:48.960]   This is why we make,
[01:40:48.960 --> 01:40:51.960]   this is why a lone individual has the power
[01:40:51.960 --> 01:40:54.400]   to make the world better or more interesting
[01:40:54.400 --> 01:40:57.600]   or give more texture to the world.
[01:40:57.600 --> 01:40:59.080]   - Yeah.
[01:40:59.080 --> 01:41:01.920]   This is for a mere 10 euros,
[01:41:01.920 --> 01:41:04.040]   you can get this full page ad
[01:41:04.040 --> 01:41:06.680]   for the Apple One computer.
[01:41:06.680 --> 01:41:07.520]   Wow. - Yes.
[01:41:07.520 --> 01:41:10.080]   - I just wanna give them some money, really.
[01:41:10.080 --> 01:41:10.920]   - Yeah.
[01:41:10.920 --> 01:41:11.760]   I might buy this.
[01:41:11.760 --> 01:41:15.240]   It'd be fun to buy this and make a poster out of it.
[01:41:15.240 --> 01:41:17.120]   - Yeah.
[01:41:17.120 --> 01:41:17.960]   - One, I'm glad that there are people.
[01:41:17.960 --> 01:41:19.200]   - It's a big thank you note.
[01:41:19.200 --> 01:41:20.640]   - Yeah, no kidding.
[01:41:20.640 --> 01:41:22.920]   - There are a lot of people who are taking upon themselves
[01:41:22.920 --> 01:41:25.480]   that have like old copies of like Dr. Jobs Journal
[01:41:25.480 --> 01:41:27.600]   or proceedings of the IEEE,
[01:41:27.600 --> 01:41:29.000]   scanning them and putting them up there
[01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:30.640]   so that people can actually see
[01:41:30.640 --> 01:41:32.280]   all of these documents in context.
[01:41:32.280 --> 01:41:37.280]   I find one of my prized possessions is the 1974, 1975
[01:41:37.280 --> 01:41:40.280]   proceedings of the IEEE conference
[01:41:40.280 --> 01:41:42.040]   where so much stuff was introduced.
[01:41:42.040 --> 01:41:46.120]   And to be able to see, well, okay, yes, Apple exhibited
[01:41:46.120 --> 01:41:50.680]   then their address is like 1258 Morris Avenue
[01:41:50.680 --> 01:41:52.280]   in some suburb.
[01:41:52.280 --> 01:41:54.400]   And the other stuff that's being talked about is that
[01:41:54.400 --> 01:41:57.800]   here's how to get ASCII working on a multiplex keyboard.
[01:41:57.800 --> 01:42:01.160]   This is the world that this thing existed in catalogs
[01:42:01.160 --> 01:42:05.360]   from 1976, 1967, 1977.
[01:42:05.360 --> 01:42:07.720]   It's all of this context stuff that we're kind of missing out on
[01:42:07.720 --> 01:42:10.400]   by simply glossing over all the details of history.
[01:42:10.400 --> 01:42:13.520]   So this is why it's really important to honor
[01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:15.640]   and protect this stuff.
[01:42:15.640 --> 01:42:20.640]   - I confess I did go on eBay and buy the inside Macintosh
[01:42:20.640 --> 01:42:24.240]   hardcover Addison Wesley volumes one, two and three.
[01:42:24.240 --> 01:42:27.120]   It was maybe a hundred bucks or something like that.
[01:42:27.120 --> 01:42:28.960]   But I had had the originals.
[01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:31.160]   Actually, I think I had the paperback versions
[01:42:31.160 --> 01:42:34.240]   and used them in my early days of programming.
[01:42:34.240 --> 01:42:37.120]   And so it was really, and you know what?
[01:42:37.120 --> 01:42:39.160]   It's really well written documentation.
[01:42:39.160 --> 01:42:40.120]   It's really good.
[01:42:40.120 --> 01:42:41.880]   - I just want to preserve all the star charts
[01:42:41.880 --> 01:42:44.000]   so that in the future the universe won't believe it.
[01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:45.680]   So in the future all our descendants won't believe
[01:42:45.680 --> 01:42:47.000]   the universe was a myth.
[01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:48.200]   They can no longer see it.
[01:42:48.200 --> 01:42:49.280]   That's so sad.
[01:42:49.280 --> 01:42:51.720]   - It'll all be satellites all the way.
[01:42:51.720 --> 01:42:52.560]   - But you're too far away.
[01:42:52.560 --> 01:42:53.880]   They'll never see the universe anymore.
[01:42:53.880 --> 01:42:55.000]   They'll just think that we made it up
[01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:55.840]   unless we preserve all the stuff.
[01:42:55.840 --> 01:42:56.840]   - There's no stars out there.
[01:42:56.840 --> 01:42:58.160]   It's just a bunch of satellites.
[01:42:58.160 --> 01:42:59.520]   - No, it's just our galaxy cluster.
[01:42:59.520 --> 01:43:01.240]   That's the only thing that exists.
[01:43:01.240 --> 01:43:02.160]   - Turtles all the way down.
[01:43:02.160 --> 01:43:03.000]   - So limited.
[01:43:04.560 --> 01:43:09.560]   - Kids, I think we should prepare our picks of the week.
[01:43:09.560 --> 01:43:10.520]   What do you say?
[01:43:10.520 --> 01:43:11.360]   You're ready?
[01:43:11.360 --> 01:43:12.200]   You're ready?
[01:43:12.200 --> 01:43:13.040]   Get ready.
[01:43:13.040 --> 01:43:13.880]   - Let's do it.
[01:43:13.880 --> 01:43:14.760]   - Picks of the week time.
[01:43:14.760 --> 01:43:16.760]   I'm going to start because I really do a pick of the week
[01:43:16.760 --> 01:43:17.880]   because I always want to give you guys
[01:43:17.880 --> 01:43:18.680]   as much time as you want.
[01:43:18.680 --> 01:43:22.480]   But as you know, I'm kind of a nut about note-taking.
[01:43:22.480 --> 01:43:26.120]   And I'm always looking at new note-taking technologies.
[01:43:26.120 --> 01:43:27.600]   And this one caught my eye.
[01:43:27.600 --> 01:43:29.440]   I've been using Notion for some time
[01:43:29.440 --> 01:43:33.040]   which is hosted on their servers and is,
[01:43:33.040 --> 01:43:34.680]   but it's a really neat thing.
[01:43:34.680 --> 01:43:36.560]   This is an Apple only version.
[01:43:36.560 --> 01:43:41.560]   iOS, iPadOS and MacOS, it's called Craft.
[01:43:41.560 --> 01:43:43.200]   And it's pretty impressive.
[01:43:43.200 --> 01:43:44.600]   You could try it free for two weeks
[01:43:44.600 --> 01:43:46.280]   and then there's a subscription.
[01:43:46.280 --> 01:43:48.600]   They even have a web editor now in beta.
[01:43:48.600 --> 01:43:50.560]   I was accepted into beta very quickly.
[01:43:50.560 --> 01:43:51.880]   It's very much like Notion.
[01:43:51.880 --> 01:43:54.600]   It's kind of a pretty note-taking app
[01:43:54.600 --> 01:43:57.080]   that gives you a lot of capabilities.
[01:43:57.080 --> 01:43:59.080]   It's very fast.
[01:43:59.080 --> 01:44:00.360]   I just think it's, you know,
[01:44:00.360 --> 01:44:01.960]   I want to share these with people
[01:44:01.960 --> 01:44:04.800]   because note-taking is the hottest thing right now.
[01:44:04.800 --> 01:44:06.160]   I've been using an open source,
[01:44:06.160 --> 01:44:07.000]   or not open source,
[01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:11.520]   but a locally hosted program called Obsidian for quite a bit.
[01:44:11.520 --> 01:44:12.560]   But I like Notion.
[01:44:12.560 --> 01:44:14.440]   I really like how pretty Notion is.
[01:44:14.440 --> 01:44:16.240]   And a lot of the Apple community,
[01:44:16.240 --> 01:44:19.360]   including Federico of a teacher who reviewed this
[01:44:19.360 --> 01:44:24.360]   when it first came out in 2020, really like this.
[01:44:24.360 --> 01:44:27.360]   So I know some of you like Ulysses and Bear
[01:44:27.360 --> 01:44:30.560]   and Scrivener and agenda and your old timers
[01:44:30.560 --> 01:44:33.600]   maybe Evernote and of course there's no nobility
[01:44:33.600 --> 01:44:35.240]   and on the iPad.
[01:44:35.240 --> 01:44:38.640]   But, and I'm a big fan of Notion and Rome,
[01:44:38.640 --> 01:44:40.360]   but this looks like a good contender.
[01:44:40.360 --> 01:44:45.360]   So try it free and then this subscription isn't too onerous.
[01:44:45.360 --> 01:44:47.440]   I think it's $45 a year,
[01:44:47.440 --> 01:44:51.320]   which gives you sinking and all of that stuff.
[01:44:51.320 --> 01:44:52.800]   So because they have a web interface,
[01:44:52.800 --> 01:44:56.400]   I'm considering it even though I use Linux primarily.
[01:44:57.280 --> 01:45:02.080]   Craft.do, Crafts.do if you're interested.
[01:45:02.080 --> 01:45:04.960]   Renee Richie, what's your pick this week?
[01:45:04.960 --> 01:45:07.560]   - So my pick, it's maybe a no brainer,
[01:45:07.560 --> 01:45:08.680]   but I often find that, you know,
[01:45:08.680 --> 01:45:10.480]   I lack the foresight to predict
[01:45:10.480 --> 01:45:12.280]   what people are no braining these days.
[01:45:12.280 --> 01:45:13.600]   So I just wanted to remind everyone
[01:45:13.600 --> 01:45:16.240]   that all the sessions from WWDC were available
[01:45:16.240 --> 01:45:19.440]   in the developer app on iOS, Mac OS,
[01:45:19.440 --> 01:45:20.560]   but also on the web.
[01:45:20.560 --> 01:45:23.920]   So you can go in and you can watch all of the details
[01:45:23.920 --> 01:45:25.480]   about how all of the stuff,
[01:45:25.480 --> 01:45:28.040]   nevermind just iOS 15, Mac OS,
[01:45:28.040 --> 01:45:30.520]   Monterey, all of those things,
[01:45:30.520 --> 01:45:33.560]   but actually like how all the new developer tools,
[01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:37.600]   how all the new processes that Apple announced really work.
[01:45:37.600 --> 01:45:39.080]   Everything from, you know,
[01:45:39.080 --> 01:45:41.240]   like the new privacy features you're showing there
[01:45:41.240 --> 01:45:44.440]   to all the new controls that they're introducing.
[01:45:44.440 --> 01:45:46.000]   Basically every big feature they announced,
[01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.640]   they have these really well packaged,
[01:45:48.640 --> 01:45:50.520]   we talked recently about the difference between
[01:45:50.520 --> 01:45:52.440]   being there live and doing it remotely
[01:45:52.440 --> 01:45:55.160]   and doing it remotely has these really tightly packed
[01:45:55.160 --> 01:45:58.600]   15 minute, 25 minute, 30 minute talks
[01:45:58.600 --> 01:46:00.800]   that just focus on exactly those topics
[01:46:00.800 --> 01:46:03.400]   and I learn a ton from them every year.
[01:46:03.400 --> 01:46:05.440]   Not to mention the developer apps are curated
[01:46:05.440 --> 01:46:07.000]   by the one and only, it's Trinity Caldwell.
[01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.960]   So they're just an extra pack of fun every season.
[01:46:09.960 --> 01:46:11.360]   - Yeah, this is a good way to do it.
[01:46:11.360 --> 01:46:12.560]   And then Alex, you liked the,
[01:46:12.560 --> 01:46:15.360]   I know the 3D object stuff that they were doing.
[01:46:15.360 --> 01:46:17.280]   - I would definitely dig into that.
[01:46:17.280 --> 01:46:18.960]   You know, it's something that's,
[01:46:18.960 --> 01:46:23.040]   it's not just that they're doing object captured
[01:46:23.040 --> 01:46:24.960]   photogrammetry so they're using all the cameras.
[01:46:24.960 --> 01:46:26.720]   I think all the cameras, at least a couple of them
[01:46:26.720 --> 01:46:28.760]   in the LIDAR to gather that data.
[01:46:28.760 --> 01:46:31.720]   And to grab objects is pretty, it's pretty exciting.
[01:46:31.720 --> 01:46:35.240]   I'm gonna be kind of on a half vacation next week.
[01:46:35.240 --> 01:46:38.240]   So I plan to do it, which usually means
[01:46:38.240 --> 01:46:39.360]   I'm gonna do a bunch of photogrammetry.
[01:46:39.360 --> 01:46:40.680]   And so-- - To download these
[01:46:40.680 --> 01:46:43.880]   and watch them offline, do you have to watch them on the?
[01:46:43.880 --> 01:46:45.040]   - You can download them.
[01:46:45.040 --> 01:46:46.880]   Yeah, you can download all of them I think.
[01:46:46.880 --> 01:46:49.920]   - That would be something to take on the plane.
[01:46:49.920 --> 01:46:51.520]   - I'm curious whether Renee, whether you think--
[01:46:51.520 --> 01:46:52.360]   - Yes you can.
[01:46:52.360 --> 01:46:57.360]   - Do you think that they'll go back to the stage after these?
[01:46:57.360 --> 01:47:03.080]   - We talked about this, I think they'll walk in,
[01:47:03.080 --> 01:47:04.600]   they'll say hi, they'll play the video
[01:47:04.600 --> 01:47:07.040]   and then they'll send you to the back room.
[01:47:07.040 --> 01:47:09.600]   - I don't, I just don't know if it makes sense to me.
[01:47:09.600 --> 01:47:12.560]   I feel like, I feel like there's huge value.
[01:47:12.560 --> 01:47:14.400]   WWDC is one of the few things that I would say,
[01:47:14.400 --> 01:47:17.320]   oh, it's worth going because there's all the engineers there
[01:47:17.320 --> 01:47:18.240]   and there's big whiteboards.
[01:47:18.240 --> 01:47:20.720]   And I don't think they've really reproduced that.
[01:47:20.720 --> 01:47:23.320]   I think that, I think what's interesting is to see
[01:47:23.320 --> 01:47:26.320]   for Dub Dub whether they have all the whiteboards,
[01:47:26.320 --> 01:47:28.120]   have the ability for people to get together,
[01:47:28.120 --> 01:47:30.880]   just up, just let you download the videos
[01:47:30.880 --> 01:47:32.000]   to get that out of the way
[01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:33.680]   so that people can spend more time mingling
[01:47:33.680 --> 01:47:35.520]   and watching the videos if they want to.
[01:47:35.520 --> 01:47:39.160]   And then continue to provide some of the one-on-one stuff
[01:47:39.160 --> 01:47:41.360]   to the online audience that they didn't do in the past.
[01:47:41.360 --> 01:47:43.200]   I think that there's a real, I think Apple,
[01:47:43.200 --> 01:47:44.280]   more than almost anyone else,
[01:47:44.280 --> 01:47:46.400]   has this really good opportunity to take Dub Dub Dub
[01:47:46.400 --> 01:47:48.960]   and just get rid of the stuff that was kind of a,
[01:47:50.640 --> 01:47:52.840]   a waste of time to have to sit there
[01:47:52.840 --> 01:47:54.840]   and watch through the whole thing at 1X.
[01:47:54.840 --> 01:47:57.600]   Because most of these are much better watched at 2X,
[01:47:57.600 --> 01:47:58.520]   in my opinion.
[01:47:58.520 --> 01:48:01.280]   Like they're good, but you could definitely do it.
[01:48:01.280 --> 01:48:03.440]   Alex says, "Hey, nobody got time to watch that
[01:48:03.440 --> 01:48:04.640]   "at normal speed."
[01:48:04.640 --> 01:48:06.720]   I know, well, the thing is is that,
[01:48:06.720 --> 01:48:11.200]   but watch it at 1.75 and it's like a nice pace.
[01:48:11.200 --> 01:48:16.600]   You have an ability beyond those of mere mortal men
[01:48:16.600 --> 01:48:18.400]   to absorb content, my friend.
[01:48:18.400 --> 01:48:20.880]   - No, I don't know, do you listen to your books at,
[01:48:20.880 --> 01:48:22.600]   - Yes, I listen at normal speed.
[01:48:22.600 --> 01:48:26.040]   Lisa listens at 2X, 1.5 to 2X.
[01:48:26.040 --> 01:48:27.200]   Every time she's listening to a book,
[01:48:27.200 --> 01:48:28.640]   I go, "What's going on?" - Some podcast is gone.
[01:48:28.640 --> 01:48:30.760]   - Really offended if you listen fast.
[01:48:30.760 --> 01:48:32.280]   - Really? - Like they're really upset at you.
[01:48:32.280 --> 01:48:34.240]   Yeah, they're like, "I recorded it in a way
[01:48:34.240 --> 01:48:36.160]   "that was meant to be listened to."
[01:48:36.160 --> 01:48:38.600]   And, how dare you make me sound like Mickey Mouse?
[01:48:38.600 --> 01:48:41.520]   - I think it's very few of our audience members
[01:48:41.520 --> 01:48:43.520]   listening at normal speed.
[01:48:43.520 --> 01:48:44.880]   - Yeah, I agree with that.
[01:48:44.880 --> 01:48:46.120]   - And it affects this American,
[01:48:46.120 --> 01:48:48.200]   I listen to this American life at normal speed.
[01:48:48.200 --> 01:48:49.240]   Like there's something about it.
[01:48:49.240 --> 01:48:50.520]   - There's a rhythm to it, that's why.
[01:48:50.520 --> 01:48:52.960]   - There's a rhythm to it that I feel uncomfortable
[01:48:52.960 --> 01:48:55.480]   going fast, but that's about the only thing
[01:48:55.480 --> 01:48:56.720]   that I listen to at 1X.
[01:48:56.720 --> 01:48:58.640]   - Yeah, interesting.
[01:48:58.640 --> 01:49:00.720]   - You're in sort of thing.
[01:49:00.720 --> 01:49:02.760]   - Yeah, I can't absorb, I just,
[01:49:02.760 --> 01:49:05.720]   yeah, I'm more into the rhythm and the sound.
[01:49:05.720 --> 01:49:08.560]   - I can't listen to it at 1X 'cause I'm 2-H-D.
[01:49:08.560 --> 01:49:09.680]   So what happens is-- - Well, I know,
[01:49:09.680 --> 01:49:11.320]   that's why Lisa can't either.
[01:49:11.320 --> 01:49:14.360]   - I add ideas between the words
[01:49:14.360 --> 01:49:17.160]   and so then I can't, I lose track of what they were saying.
[01:49:17.160 --> 01:49:19.080]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - At 1.75.
[01:49:19.080 --> 01:49:21.560]   - I can listen to it all and it's just saturating
[01:49:21.560 --> 01:49:24.040]   my synapses and then I'm good.
[01:49:24.040 --> 01:49:26.760]   (laughing)
[01:49:26.760 --> 01:49:29.480]   - The synapses are saturated.
[01:49:29.480 --> 01:49:32.600]   Mr. Andy Inako, pick of the week.
[01:49:32.600 --> 01:49:35.000]   - My pick of the week is kind of odd,
[01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:36.520]   but I'm having fun with it.
[01:49:36.520 --> 01:49:39.080]   It is a service called shadow.
[01:49:39.080 --> 01:49:39.920]   - Oh, it's good.
[01:49:39.920 --> 01:49:40.760]   - Yes.
[01:49:40.760 --> 01:49:42.880]   - You know, Anthony loves this.
[01:49:42.880 --> 01:49:45.360]   - Yeah, shadow.tech.
[01:49:45.360 --> 01:49:47.080]   But since I've been trying to find ways
[01:49:47.080 --> 01:49:50.520]   to make sure I maximize value on my iPad Pro,
[01:49:50.520 --> 01:49:52.040]   when the only disappointments I have
[01:49:52.040 --> 01:49:54.120]   that I really wish I had a desktop browser,
[01:49:54.120 --> 01:49:56.840]   there are some desktop apps that I kind of miss.
[01:49:56.840 --> 01:49:59.120]   There are times where I wish I had the real Photoshop
[01:49:59.120 --> 01:50:00.760]   just for a little while.
[01:50:00.760 --> 01:50:03.320]   And so I've been checking out shadow.tech.
[01:50:03.320 --> 01:50:07.280]   It is a subscription based PC service.
[01:50:07.280 --> 01:50:09.040]   So it's a cloud based computing.
[01:50:09.040 --> 01:50:11.320]   So once you install the app on iOS
[01:50:11.320 --> 01:50:13.840]   and pay 30 bucks a month, you'll be real--
[01:50:13.840 --> 01:50:14.920]   - Wow, that's expensive.
[01:50:14.920 --> 01:50:15.760]   - Wow.
[01:50:15.760 --> 01:50:17.840]   - It is expensive, but what happens is that
[01:50:17.840 --> 01:50:22.560]   the window in your iOS device or the full stream
[01:50:22.560 --> 01:50:24.920]   becomes a Windows machine.
[01:50:24.920 --> 01:50:28.280]   It's running Windows on Windows hardware remotely.
[01:50:28.280 --> 01:50:30.840]   And if you've got like a halfway decent Wi-Fi signal,
[01:50:30.840 --> 01:50:32.560]   the latency is really, really good.
[01:50:32.560 --> 01:50:33.880]   It's snappy and responsive.
[01:50:33.880 --> 01:50:35.920]   And there's nothing special to do.
[01:50:35.920 --> 01:50:37.920]   It's not as though you have to install,
[01:50:37.920 --> 01:50:40.160]   choose from special apps that they've made available.
[01:50:40.160 --> 01:50:42.360]   No, literally you have a Windows desktop
[01:50:42.360 --> 01:50:44.440]   that you can then do whatever you want to.
[01:50:44.440 --> 01:50:46.360]   And it has a one gigabyte per second
[01:50:46.360 --> 01:50:49.280]   connection to the internet from wherever the server is.
[01:50:49.280 --> 01:50:51.920]   So then you can just install, download and install,
[01:50:51.920 --> 01:50:55.480]   Photoshop, download install, Microsoft Office,
[01:50:55.480 --> 01:50:58.080]   download, install Chrome or whatever you want.
[01:50:58.080 --> 01:50:58.920]   It's fast enough.
[01:50:58.920 --> 01:51:01.040]   They say it's fast enough for gaming.
[01:51:01.040 --> 01:51:04.160]   The graphics card is a GTX 1080,
[01:51:04.160 --> 01:51:06.440]   which is absolutely no slouch.
[01:51:06.440 --> 01:51:11.120]   You get 12 gigabytes of RAM, 256 gigabytes of storage.
[01:51:11.120 --> 01:51:12.920]   You can expand that if you'd like.
[01:51:12.920 --> 01:51:17.720]   And of course, if you're using iCloud for iCloud Dropbox,
[01:51:17.720 --> 01:51:19.080]   any other sort of remote storage,
[01:51:19.080 --> 01:51:20.280]   of course you can connect that.
[01:51:20.280 --> 01:51:22.880]   Again, just like you had a Windows laptop
[01:51:22.880 --> 01:51:26.480]   or a Windows desktop, it will simply connect to iCloud
[01:51:26.480 --> 01:51:28.680]   and use your files that way.
[01:51:28.680 --> 01:51:31.640]   And because of the mouse and keyboard support
[01:51:31.640 --> 01:51:34.760]   you have on your iPad, it works really, really well.
[01:51:34.760 --> 01:51:36.800]   And not only that, but it's available
[01:51:36.800 --> 01:51:38.960]   if it has client apps for iPad.
[01:51:38.960 --> 01:51:43.080]   Also Apple TV has clients for Android,
[01:51:43.080 --> 01:51:44.400]   clients for macOS.
[01:51:44.400 --> 01:51:48.960]   So wherever you are, you can connect to this virtual,
[01:51:48.960 --> 01:51:51.360]   it's not a virtual, it's like an actual remote PC
[01:51:51.360 --> 01:51:53.280]   that you're connecting to wherever you want.
[01:51:53.280 --> 01:51:57.480]   And yes, 30 bucks a month is not cheap at all.
[01:51:57.480 --> 01:51:58.680]   - 'Cause cheaper than a PC.
[01:51:58.680 --> 01:52:00.000]   I mean, that's right.
[01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:01.520]   - When you do the math, yeah.
[01:52:01.520 --> 01:52:03.760]   If I were to build a PC with the specs,
[01:52:03.760 --> 01:52:05.760]   this is sort of like a, it's a Xeon processor,
[01:52:05.760 --> 01:52:08.520]   but I'm guessing that it's kind of like a high-end
[01:52:08.520 --> 01:52:11.760]   I-5, it would cost, it would take about a couple years,
[01:52:11.760 --> 01:52:14.280]   maybe three years, including the graphics card,
[01:52:14.280 --> 01:52:17.680]   like at MSRP prices to get back the cost
[01:52:17.680 --> 01:52:20.000]   of what you would have spent on a PC.
[01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:21.760]   But the other thing is there's no contract involved.
[01:52:21.760 --> 01:52:24.880]   So if you just need this for like a month worth of travel,
[01:52:24.880 --> 01:52:27.240]   you can just simply subscribe and then cancel
[01:52:27.240 --> 01:52:28.520]   after your first month.
[01:52:28.520 --> 01:52:31.240]   - This might solve my Valheim problem
[01:52:31.240 --> 01:52:33.360]   when we go to Hawaii.
[01:52:33.360 --> 01:52:34.880]   - Yeah, it's, I haven't done,
[01:52:34.880 --> 01:52:36.480]   I haven't done much gaming on it
[01:52:36.480 --> 01:52:37.920]   because I'm not that much of a gamer,
[01:52:37.920 --> 01:52:42.920]   but the spec says that does support 4K, 60 frames per second.
[01:52:42.920 --> 01:52:46.280]   It is, it was originally proposition a couple years ago
[01:52:46.280 --> 01:52:48.560]   as a streaming gaming platform.
[01:52:48.560 --> 01:52:51.880]   And on the side, you could also do Windows stuff on it.
[01:52:51.880 --> 01:52:54.640]   That's how I first got interested in actually,
[01:52:54.640 --> 01:52:55.720]   actually I'd update my account
[01:52:55.720 --> 01:52:58.040]   'cause I didn't use it in like a year and a half.
[01:52:58.040 --> 01:53:00.880]   I wasn't paying for it, but the had the account enabled.
[01:53:00.880 --> 01:53:02.760]   And I'm actually using it for real stuff.
[01:53:02.760 --> 01:53:04.800]   It's very, very credible.
[01:53:04.800 --> 01:53:08.240]   At the minimum requirements are 15 megabits per second
[01:53:08.240 --> 01:53:09.280]   internet connection.
[01:53:09.280 --> 01:53:13.840]   So I can just about use it on my Wi-Fi hotspot.
[01:53:13.840 --> 01:53:17.280]   If you've got better mobile internet speed,
[01:53:17.280 --> 01:53:18.640]   it'll work fine there.
[01:53:18.640 --> 01:53:22.720]   But yeah, I like, it's gotten me sort of interested in
[01:53:22.720 --> 01:53:27.720]   particularly if you have a $35, excuse me, $50 Google Chromecast
[01:53:27.720 --> 01:53:31.800]   dongle, it'll run on that 'cause it runs on Android TV.
[01:53:31.800 --> 01:53:33.640]   If you've got an Apple TV, it'll run on that.
[01:53:33.640 --> 01:53:35.720]   So technically speaking, if you Bluetooth,
[01:53:35.720 --> 01:53:37.680]   a mouse and a keyboard to your Apple TV,
[01:53:37.680 --> 01:53:42.680]   you can also use it as a very, very productive Windows PC.
[01:53:42.680 --> 01:53:45.120]   Again, as long as you're willing to spend 30 bucks a month
[01:53:45.120 --> 01:53:46.360]   for however long you need it.
[01:53:46.360 --> 01:53:49.760]   But it's good enough that I'm sticking with it
[01:53:49.760 --> 01:53:51.760]   just to see how much it can do.
[01:53:51.760 --> 01:53:53.720]   Again, the biggest pain to my existence
[01:53:53.720 --> 01:53:55.920]   when it comes to using an iPad as a real PC
[01:53:55.920 --> 01:54:00.920]   isn't just a daily, daily stress and daily, daily problems.
[01:54:00.920 --> 01:54:03.920]   That one case where, damn it, I've got,
[01:54:03.920 --> 01:54:06.280]   I'm spending two and a half days in New York.
[01:54:06.280 --> 01:54:09.640]   I've got this one thing for which I need a desktop app.
[01:54:09.640 --> 01:54:12.200]   And for that reason, I'm gonna have to take my full laptop
[01:54:12.200 --> 01:54:14.560]   and the power bricks and everything with it.
[01:54:14.560 --> 01:54:16.440]   With this, it would be very, very easy for me to say,
[01:54:16.440 --> 01:54:18.520]   nope, I don't care that I'm in my last two weeks
[01:54:18.520 --> 01:54:20.680]   of writing this book and I need a Microsoft Office
[01:54:20.680 --> 01:54:22.160]   'cause that's what the publisher uses.
[01:54:22.160 --> 01:54:24.880]   I can actually run the full desktop Microsoft Office
[01:54:24.880 --> 01:54:27.560]   on this screen, it'll run more than well enough
[01:54:27.560 --> 01:54:29.360]   to get the job done for the next week.
[01:54:29.360 --> 01:54:31.840]   - Nice, I'm gonna have to check it out.
[01:54:31.840 --> 01:54:34.960]   I was thinking of just putting like a remote PC
[01:54:34.960 --> 01:54:36.400]   on my PC at all.
[01:54:36.400 --> 01:54:38.120]   - Yeah, I was logging into it from,
[01:54:38.120 --> 01:54:41.960]   but I only have 40 meg, 40 meg's up.
[01:54:41.960 --> 01:54:44.120]   They have a much faster upstream.
[01:54:44.120 --> 01:54:47.120]   - And the problem was, 'cause I do have
[01:54:47.120 --> 01:54:49.840]   Adobe software screens, which I really, really like
[01:54:49.840 --> 01:54:51.480]   as a remote access solution.
[01:54:51.480 --> 01:54:55.280]   Unfortunately, it is a standard like remote access solution.
[01:54:55.280 --> 01:54:58.800]   So you're gonna have to leave, make sure that you have a Mac
[01:54:58.800 --> 01:55:01.800]   that's going to be responsive to internet wake-ups
[01:55:01.800 --> 01:55:05.920]   and signals, but also make sure that you're securing it
[01:55:05.920 --> 01:55:08.600]   properly so that you're not just leaving an open port
[01:55:08.600 --> 01:55:10.440]   that other people can log into your PC.
[01:55:10.440 --> 01:55:13.320]   I like the fact that I've got this separate remote
[01:55:13.320 --> 01:55:15.840]   Windows machine that I don't, I'm not necessarily even
[01:55:15.840 --> 01:55:17.120]   storing anything important on.
[01:55:17.120 --> 01:55:20.560]   If that gets compromised, that would be a bummer,
[01:55:20.560 --> 01:55:22.360]   but I could just simply nuke the whole thing
[01:55:22.360 --> 01:55:24.720]   and they wouldn't get access to my entire network,
[01:55:24.720 --> 01:55:28.640]   they just get access to this little 256 gigabyte notebook
[01:55:28.640 --> 01:55:31.240]   that I probably would have spent $700, $600 on.
[01:55:31.240 --> 01:55:36.680]   - Why does it say subscribe now ready to use
[01:55:36.680 --> 01:55:39.240]   by December 31st, 2021?
[01:55:39.240 --> 01:55:42.560]   - It's 'cause they actually have to put a blade in.
[01:55:42.560 --> 01:55:44.400]   - They have to put a blade in.
[01:55:44.400 --> 01:55:47.320]   So don't get your hopes up, kids.
[01:55:47.320 --> 01:55:49.280]   - I'm not using this maybe next year.
[01:55:49.280 --> 01:55:50.120]   - Really?
[01:55:50.120 --> 01:55:51.440]   (laughing)
[01:55:51.440 --> 01:55:54.760]   - Maybe it's because I'm sorry, I didn't see that.
[01:55:54.760 --> 01:55:58.560]   Again, I had a set up right now in Tri-Valheim,
[01:55:58.560 --> 01:56:01.800]   but I don't know, I have to wait the next year.
[01:56:01.800 --> 01:56:02.640]   - Really?
[01:56:02.640 --> 01:56:03.480]   - How long did it take?
[01:56:03.480 --> 01:56:05.600]   - I was anti for you, how long did it take?
[01:56:05.600 --> 01:56:08.680]   - So I only tried it when it first launched in California
[01:56:08.680 --> 01:56:11.080]   like a couple of years ago, and I was in April,
[01:56:11.080 --> 01:56:12.480]   I peered it and then I had the December.
[01:56:12.480 --> 01:56:14.560]   - Oh, I see, 'cause we're in California.
[01:56:14.560 --> 01:56:17.680]   That's the problem, if I were in, that's the problem.
[01:56:17.680 --> 01:56:21.760]   So California is behind, if I were in Massachusetts, no.
[01:56:21.760 --> 01:56:23.840]   If I were in Rhode Island, let me see,
[01:56:23.840 --> 01:56:26.880]   maybe you're just lucky, no, try another stay.
[01:56:26.880 --> 01:56:29.040]   - I think they also got purchase,
[01:56:29.040 --> 01:56:30.480]   or acquired by that company,
[01:56:30.480 --> 01:56:33.760]   so they're shaking things out, so that would be a part of it.
[01:56:33.760 --> 01:56:35.800]   - So that's all over the blog.
[01:56:35.800 --> 01:56:38.360]   And I'm surprised, 'cause I'm just like,
[01:56:38.360 --> 01:56:41.400]   I hadn't used it for a couple of years.
[01:56:41.400 --> 01:56:43.280]   - You were working, you signed up.
[01:56:43.280 --> 01:56:46.520]   - Again, all I had to do was log back in,
[01:56:46.520 --> 01:56:48.040]   oh, you'd forgot your password here,
[01:56:48.040 --> 01:56:49.800]   you do a new password, oh, by the way,
[01:56:49.800 --> 01:56:51.160]   we changed our entire system now,
[01:56:51.160 --> 01:56:53.600]   so you're gonna have to update to everything
[01:56:53.600 --> 01:56:55.760]   and figure out a brand new feature.
[01:56:55.760 --> 01:56:59.120]   Andy mentioned anything, 'cause if you all signed up,
[01:56:59.120 --> 01:57:02.040]   I'm not gonna get it by December 31st, 2021.
[01:57:02.040 --> 01:57:04.800]   Okay, well, you know what?
[01:57:04.800 --> 01:57:05.640]   - I'm up now.
[01:57:05.640 --> 01:57:07.440]   - You know what, try to order an iPad,
[01:57:07.440 --> 01:57:08.280]   get figured how you want it.
[01:57:08.280 --> 01:57:09.800]   See, I'm all along, you're off to wait for that,
[01:57:09.800 --> 01:57:10.960]   and that's actually hard work.
[01:57:10.960 --> 01:57:12.040]   - No, this is cool.
[01:57:12.040 --> 01:57:14.040]   - I'm sorry, you've came to the world.
[01:57:14.040 --> 01:57:14.880]   - You've came to the right Anthony,
[01:57:14.880 --> 01:57:16.200]   I mean, you came with it.
[01:57:16.200 --> 01:57:17.080]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:57:17.080 --> 01:57:18.880]   Like, I get that, that was a few years ago,
[01:57:18.880 --> 01:57:19.720]   but yeah, it's like--
[01:57:19.720 --> 01:57:21.440]   - It's kinda 1080, steady, or anything,
[01:57:21.440 --> 01:57:23.640]   but it's nice as you get the full Windows experience.
[01:57:23.640 --> 01:57:24.960]   - 12 gigs of RAM.
[01:57:24.960 --> 01:57:26.400]   - That's nice, mm-hmm.
[01:57:26.400 --> 01:57:30.840]   - Shadow, it's at shadow.tech,
[01:57:30.840 --> 01:57:33.800]   if you wanna know more, shadow.tech.
[01:57:33.800 --> 01:57:38.040]   And now, we've saved the most expensive for last.
[01:57:38.040 --> 01:57:38.920]   - It's not too expensive.
[01:57:38.920 --> 01:57:40.440]   - Actually, no, we haven't, look at that.
[01:57:40.440 --> 01:57:42.600]   - Yeah, one of the things that I realized is that
[01:57:42.600 --> 01:57:43.800]   sometimes I don't talk about stuff
[01:57:43.800 --> 01:57:45.360]   that we're using all the time in office hours,
[01:57:45.360 --> 01:57:46.720]   'cause you think it's obvious,
[01:57:46.720 --> 01:57:49.080]   but everybody knows about this.
[01:57:49.080 --> 01:57:50.480]   - Well, this is it that we talk about it,
[01:57:50.480 --> 01:57:53.840]   and so what we use it, we use it, everybody's using these,
[01:57:53.840 --> 01:57:56.480]   and I realize that I keep on getting the question,
[01:57:56.480 --> 01:57:59.120]   so I figured I should put it into recommendation.
[01:57:59.120 --> 01:58:01.440]   So what I'm recommending specifically is the
[01:58:01.440 --> 01:58:04.960]   Blackmagic bi-directional STI to HDMI 3G,
[01:58:04.960 --> 01:58:06.760]   and the reason that I'm talking about it is
[01:58:06.760 --> 01:58:09.320]   that a whole bunch of us have got these little ATEM minis,
[01:58:09.320 --> 01:58:13.400]   but we also might have some of the older STI cameras,
[01:58:13.400 --> 01:58:15.200]   but you can't shade the cameras with it
[01:58:15.200 --> 01:58:17.680]   because it's HDMI instead of the minis
[01:58:17.680 --> 01:58:19.160]   or HDMI instead of STI.
[01:58:19.160 --> 01:58:20.920]   - So you need bi-directional?
[01:58:20.920 --> 01:58:23.720]   - What it does is it will connect to the in and out
[01:58:23.720 --> 01:58:26.360]   of that camera so that you can shade the camera
[01:58:26.360 --> 01:58:29.720]   from your extreme or your mini,
[01:58:29.720 --> 01:58:32.040]   and you can go the other way as well,
[01:58:32.040 --> 01:58:35.800]   so you can shade your pocket cinemas from a larger switcher.
[01:58:35.800 --> 01:58:38.720]   And it's one of those things that when you explain to someone,
[01:58:38.720 --> 01:58:40.640]   "Oh, you gotta get that little box to go."
[01:58:40.640 --> 01:58:43.840]   - Oh, right, that would be useful.
[01:58:43.840 --> 01:58:46.400]   So it's one of those things that be,
[01:58:46.400 --> 01:58:48.040]   the biggest, the number one reason we do this
[01:58:48.040 --> 01:58:52.360]   is to be able to control the micro studio cameras,
[01:58:52.360 --> 01:58:54.360]   which are nice and tiny and small,
[01:58:54.360 --> 01:58:57.320]   and you wanna run those in into your switcher
[01:58:57.320 --> 01:58:58.880]   and being able to do that is something
[01:58:58.880 --> 01:58:59.720]   that you need this for.
[01:58:59.720 --> 01:59:03.240]   So it's like a little piece of glue that a lot of us have,
[01:59:03.240 --> 01:59:06.680]   and we have HDMI cameras, which we wanna get on our SDI
[01:59:06.680 --> 01:59:08.920]   so for the TriCaster, so that's what we use
[01:59:08.920 --> 01:59:10.280]   for the conversion.
[01:59:10.280 --> 01:59:12.480]   - Right, and you can get those are now,
[01:59:12.480 --> 01:59:14.800]   those little HDMI to STI's are really inexpensive
[01:59:14.800 --> 01:59:16.440]   from Black Mansion, they're 40, 50 bucks
[01:59:16.440 --> 01:59:18.600]   or something like that, so they're super cheap.
[01:59:18.600 --> 01:59:21.120]   This bi-directional one, which is a little bit more expensive,
[01:59:21.120 --> 01:59:24.520]   allows you again to do, it's really for,
[01:59:24.520 --> 01:59:26.160]   the only reason you'd get the bi-directional one
[01:59:26.160 --> 01:59:28.600]   is if you're already in the Black Magic ecosystem
[01:59:28.600 --> 01:59:30.560]   and you're trying to go back and forth
[01:59:30.560 --> 01:59:33.520]   to a bigger camera or back and forth to a bigger switcher.
[01:59:33.520 --> 01:59:37.800]   So it's really very specific to that need,
[01:59:37.800 --> 01:59:41.720]   but again, a lot of us have migrated
[01:59:41.720 --> 01:59:46.720]   to having these switchers for our basic setup.
[01:59:46.720 --> 01:59:51.080]   - Nice, so as usual, it's at blackmagicdesign.com.
[01:59:51.080 --> 01:59:52.320]   All their stuff is great.
[01:59:52.320 --> 01:59:56.560]   - They've built a really strong ecosystem.
[01:59:56.560 --> 01:59:58.400]   I think that's the thing that, again,
[01:59:58.400 --> 02:00:00.000]   when we got back to ecosystems,
[02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:03.040]   is that it does, there is a certain amount of lock-in
[02:00:03.040 --> 02:00:04.960]   'cause once you get it working,
[02:00:04.960 --> 02:00:06.960]   like all the stuff just works when you plug it in.
[02:00:06.960 --> 02:00:10.640]   So it's a slick little way to do it.
[02:00:10.640 --> 02:00:11.960]   - Yeah.
[02:00:11.960 --> 02:00:13.760]   - And their stuff's good.
[02:00:13.760 --> 02:00:14.600]   - It is.
[02:00:14.600 --> 02:00:16.680]   - That's Alex Lindsey, and that's his recommendation
[02:00:16.680 --> 02:00:19.600]   from Office Hours, Office Hours.global,
[02:00:19.600 --> 02:00:23.280]   if you wanna know more, join the fun, join the gang.
[02:00:23.280 --> 02:00:25.480]   He works for 090.media,
[02:00:25.480 --> 02:00:28.760]   and he, of course, is @AlexLindsay on the Twitter.
[02:00:28.760 --> 02:00:29.600]   Thank you, Alan.
[02:00:29.600 --> 02:00:31.320]   - By the way, some tests I did last week
[02:00:31.320 --> 02:00:33.200]   that were kind of fun that are just floating up there
[02:00:33.200 --> 02:00:36.200]   on my YouTube page are HDR tests,
[02:00:36.200 --> 02:00:39.520]   stream tests to YouTube.
[02:00:39.520 --> 02:00:41.560]   So those are HDR 10.
[02:00:41.560 --> 02:00:43.520]   So if anyone wants to see, if you have a phone
[02:00:43.520 --> 02:00:45.560]   that can see it or an iPad or an RMac
[02:00:45.560 --> 02:00:47.760]   that can see HDR, you may find,
[02:00:47.760 --> 02:00:50.320]   if you don't, it'll look kind of dull.
[02:00:50.320 --> 02:00:51.800]   - It'll look like this.
[02:00:51.800 --> 02:00:54.000]   - Put it in the backyard.
[02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:55.960]   But if you scroll through some of those,
[02:00:55.960 --> 02:00:56.840]   you'll just see me throw,
[02:00:56.840 --> 02:01:00.200]   I'm gonna throw a couple more of those up here and there.
[02:01:00.200 --> 02:01:02.920]   - Shot with a black magic, no doubt, pocket.
[02:01:02.920 --> 02:01:06.920]   - Yeah, this is an Ursa, a black magic Ursa,
[02:01:06.920 --> 02:01:09.800]   and then it has a PQ for the geeks out there.
[02:01:09.800 --> 02:01:12.400]   It's got a PQ, a LUT, and then that LUT goes
[02:01:12.400 --> 02:01:17.600]   into an elemental UHD length that has a 10-bit uplink.
[02:01:17.600 --> 02:01:22.600]   And that first one, yeah, there we go, it got fixed.
[02:01:22.600 --> 02:01:24.840]   So let's say the first one, I didn't have the LUT on it.
[02:01:24.840 --> 02:01:25.800]   - The LUT was very beginning.
[02:01:25.800 --> 02:01:27.320]   - So that shows you what a LUT does.
[02:01:27.320 --> 02:01:31.240]   So this is the S-Log and then this is with a LUT applied,
[02:01:31.240 --> 02:01:33.320]   all of a sudden it looks right.
[02:01:33.320 --> 02:01:35.440]   - And there's still some, there are a little issue
[02:01:35.440 --> 02:01:39.960]   with the sky there 'cause my max CLL wasn't right,
[02:01:39.960 --> 02:01:40.880]   but I'm working on that.
[02:01:40.880 --> 02:01:43.920]   And so the, but these are tests,
[02:01:43.920 --> 02:01:45.920]   I actually bought the only reason that exists
[02:01:45.920 --> 02:01:46.760]   in my backyard is because it's--
[02:01:46.760 --> 02:01:48.960]   - It just doesn't look like something you'd buy to be else.
[02:01:48.960 --> 02:01:50.600]   - No, no, it's literally, it's colorful
[02:01:50.600 --> 02:01:53.360]   with little things, it's got specular HDR.
[02:01:53.360 --> 02:01:54.200]   - Yeah, that's a hell of a man.
[02:01:54.200 --> 02:01:55.960]   - And when it spins, the reason I got it
[02:01:55.960 --> 02:01:59.840]   is because it lets me do tests with motion blur
[02:01:59.840 --> 02:02:01.320]   with those things with a little spinner.
[02:02:01.320 --> 02:02:05.640]   And so anyway, but if you, I'll be continuing to post these,
[02:02:05.640 --> 02:02:08.320]   I've got this new, what's called an elemental link
[02:02:08.320 --> 02:02:10.760]   that is UHD 10-bit 16 channel.
[02:02:10.760 --> 02:02:13.040]   And so you'll see little things pop up
[02:02:13.040 --> 02:02:14.320]   on my YouTube channel.
[02:02:14.320 --> 02:02:16.240]   I'm going to stream them live.
[02:02:16.240 --> 02:02:17.680]   - That's cool, that's really cool.
[02:02:17.680 --> 02:02:19.760]   - Yeah, it's one of the first,
[02:02:19.760 --> 02:02:21.520]   it's not the first stream, but it's,
[02:02:21.520 --> 02:02:25.200]   there's not many people streaming HDR 10 to YouTube right now.
[02:02:25.200 --> 02:02:28.160]   And so my next little challenge is to get ambisonic working
[02:02:28.160 --> 02:02:29.960]   and then, so we'll--
[02:02:29.960 --> 02:02:30.960]   - So this is stream live.
[02:02:30.960 --> 02:02:32.560]   - I'm playing this stream live, wow.
[02:02:32.560 --> 02:02:34.600]   - Yeah, that recorded but streamed live.
[02:02:34.600 --> 02:02:38.060]   - Yeah, wow, very cool, very cool.
[02:02:38.060 --> 02:02:41.360]   - Alex, you're amazing.
[02:02:41.360 --> 02:02:45.600]   That's YouTube.com/AlexLindsay, L-I-N-D-S-A-Y.
[02:02:45.600 --> 02:02:50.040]   Andy Enaco is from WGBH Boston, public radio.
[02:02:50.040 --> 02:02:51.920]   He'll be on in the library soon,
[02:02:51.920 --> 02:02:53.280]   but you can hear him on Fridays.
[02:02:53.280 --> 02:02:54.120]   - Soon enough.
[02:02:54.120 --> 02:02:54.960]   - Yeah, soon enough.
[02:02:54.960 --> 02:02:58.480]   I-H-N-A-T-K-O.com.
[02:02:58.480 --> 02:02:59.320]   Renee Ritchie.
[02:02:59.320 --> 02:03:00.560]   - Most personal friend, what are you?
[02:03:00.560 --> 02:03:02.120]   - Aw.
[02:03:02.120 --> 02:03:05.040]   @ReneeRitchie, YouTube.com/ReneeRitchie.
[02:03:05.040 --> 02:03:07.600]   What are you working on these days?
[02:03:07.600 --> 02:03:10.240]   - I just put up an explainer for how Apple's private relay
[02:03:10.240 --> 02:03:11.240]   service works, I'm going to call it--
[02:03:11.240 --> 02:03:12.080]   - Oh, good.
[02:03:12.080 --> 02:03:14.560]   - Details and now I'm, why it's not a VPN,
[02:03:14.560 --> 02:03:16.840]   why it does things very differently.
[02:03:16.840 --> 02:03:19.200]   And now I'm working on, I also explained the YouTube thing,
[02:03:19.200 --> 02:03:20.400]   but now I'm working on it.
[02:03:20.400 --> 02:03:22.200]   - Yes, I love your reaction shot.
[02:03:22.200 --> 02:03:25.480]   You got the great reaction shots going here.
[02:03:25.480 --> 02:03:26.400]   - Oh, ooh.
[02:03:26.400 --> 02:03:28.200]   - That was a conversation about Canadian.
[02:03:28.200 --> 02:03:29.040]   - Ah.
[02:03:29.040 --> 02:03:31.280]   (laughing)
[02:03:31.280 --> 02:03:32.840]   Yeah.
[02:03:32.840 --> 02:03:33.680]   - It was funny.
[02:03:33.680 --> 02:03:34.960]   - I'm in universal control next.
[02:03:34.960 --> 02:03:37.880]   - Oh, good, oh, I can't wait to see that demoed.
[02:03:37.880 --> 02:03:38.720]   I'm very excited about that.
[02:03:38.720 --> 02:03:39.800]   - There's a lot of really good security
[02:03:39.800 --> 02:03:41.600]   and privacy protections there to make sure, you know,
[02:03:41.600 --> 02:03:43.240]   like I can't take over Andy's.
[02:03:43.240 --> 02:03:45.040]   Mac, you know, with operation.
[02:03:45.040 --> 02:03:45.880]   - Yeah.
[02:03:45.880 --> 02:03:46.720]   - All that sort of stuff.
[02:03:46.720 --> 02:03:47.560]   - It looks like you--
[02:03:47.560 --> 02:03:48.840]   - You, you, anytime.
[02:03:48.840 --> 02:03:51.840]   - You had Kevin Lynch on, which is very cool.
[02:03:51.840 --> 02:03:52.680]   - Yeah, oh, that's great.
[02:03:52.680 --> 02:03:54.760]   Yeah, Kevin Lynch and Diyodra called back,
[02:03:54.760 --> 02:03:57.080]   Kevin Lynch's VP of software at Apple,
[02:03:57.080 --> 02:03:59.000]   mostly in charge of watch and health.
[02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:01.360]   And Diyodra is product marketing for watch and health.
[02:04:01.360 --> 02:04:03.480]   And they were so much fun, like,
[02:04:03.480 --> 02:04:05.640]   Kevin is such a nerds nerd.
[02:04:05.640 --> 02:04:07.320]   And he has so many great stories.
[02:04:07.320 --> 02:04:09.040]   Like I asked them what went through their minds
[02:04:09.040 --> 02:04:11.400]   when Apple first told them they were going to be making a watch.
[02:04:11.400 --> 02:04:13.680]   And they were very happy to answer that.
[02:04:13.680 --> 02:04:15.880]   And then also how they balance out their features.
[02:04:15.880 --> 02:04:18.240]   I asked Kevin where that teleportation app was
[02:04:18.240 --> 02:04:20.080]   that he teased four years ago.
[02:04:20.080 --> 02:04:22.600]   And Craig was still teasing this year.
[02:04:22.600 --> 02:04:24.800]   And he said that it's like the beta test is hard
[02:04:24.800 --> 02:04:26.960]   because people don't want to sign up for the carry.
[02:04:26.960 --> 02:04:28.720]   One guy gets stuck halfway through a wall
[02:04:28.720 --> 02:04:29.800]   and nobody else wants to use it.
[02:04:29.800 --> 02:04:30.640]   - Nobody wants to use it.
[02:04:30.640 --> 02:04:32.680]   - Was it one, goes wrong once, yeah.
[02:04:32.680 --> 02:04:34.320]   Sad. - They were so much fun
[02:04:34.320 --> 02:04:35.560]   to talk to us, very nice to them.
[02:04:35.560 --> 02:04:37.960]   - Nice, very nice.
[02:04:37.960 --> 02:04:39.480]   Thank you all three of you.
[02:04:39.480 --> 02:04:40.760]   Always great to see you.
[02:04:40.760 --> 02:04:44.320]   We do Mac break weekly every Tuesday, 11 a.m. Pacific, 2 p.m.
[02:04:44.320 --> 02:04:47.440]   Eastern time, 1800 UTC.
[02:04:47.440 --> 02:04:48.800]   You can watch us do it live.
[02:04:48.800 --> 02:04:51.920]   In fact, get here before the show begins at
[02:04:51.920 --> 02:04:54.240]   you to a twit.tv/live.
[02:04:54.240 --> 02:04:57.040]   It's on YouTube live, you stream Twitch
[02:04:57.040 --> 02:04:59.440]   or right other places, but they're all aggregated at
[02:04:59.440 --> 02:05:03.240]   you twit.tv/live.
[02:05:03.240 --> 02:05:08.240]   Watching live, chat with us live at irc.twit.tv.
[02:05:08.880 --> 02:05:12.200]   On demand versions of the show available at our website.
[02:05:12.200 --> 02:05:15.000]   That's twit.tv/mbw.
[02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:17.240]   You'll see a link there to our YouTube channel,
[02:05:17.240 --> 02:05:19.040]   which has all the Mac break weekly episodes
[02:05:19.040 --> 02:05:22.480]   plus various podcast clients and an RSS link.
[02:05:22.480 --> 02:05:24.200]   So you can use it with any podcast client.
[02:05:24.200 --> 02:05:25.760]   Subscribe, you'll get it automatically
[02:05:25.760 --> 02:05:27.400]   and you'll make me feel good.
[02:05:27.400 --> 02:05:30.400]   And if you can, leave us a five star review
[02:05:30.400 --> 02:05:33.440]   so others can discover the goodness
[02:05:33.440 --> 02:05:35.800]   that is Mac break weekly.
[02:05:35.800 --> 02:05:38.520]   People who are in the club, of course,
[02:05:38.520 --> 02:05:41.560]   get ad free versions of all of our shows.
[02:05:41.560 --> 02:05:45.440]   They got access to our club twit discord server,
[02:05:45.440 --> 02:05:46.920]   which is really a lot of fun.
[02:05:46.920 --> 02:05:49.960]   All sorts of things going on in there.
[02:05:49.960 --> 02:05:52.960]   And to the twit plus feed, which has material
[02:05:52.960 --> 02:05:55.160]   that does not make it into the podcasts,
[02:05:55.160 --> 02:05:56.400]   all the fun stuff.
[02:05:56.400 --> 02:05:59.360]   Seven bucks a month, it's a big support.
[02:05:59.360 --> 02:06:01.880]   It really is a big support for us.
[02:06:01.880 --> 02:06:04.440]   And we really appreciate those of you who have joined.
[02:06:04.440 --> 02:06:09.440]   If you want to know more, go to twit.tv/clubtwit.
[02:06:09.440 --> 02:06:11.520]   And we thank you.
[02:06:11.520 --> 02:06:13.080]   We've started doing a new thing,
[02:06:13.080 --> 02:06:16.000]   which I think is gonna be a lot of fun called tech break.
[02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.600]   It's our latest, it's not a show.
[02:06:18.600 --> 02:06:20.760]   I can't really call it a show,
[02:06:20.760 --> 02:06:24.240]   but the idea is when important tech news breaks,
[02:06:24.240 --> 02:06:27.800]   one of our team, Alex Lindsey, no, not you Alex,
[02:06:27.800 --> 02:06:29.440]   you're not on our team.
[02:06:29.440 --> 02:06:31.480]   Jason Howell, I wish you were.
[02:06:31.480 --> 02:06:35.000]   Micah Sergeant, myself, Ant Pruitt,
[02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:38.280]   will jump on, put something out on our tech break feed,
[02:06:38.280 --> 02:06:42.600]   twit.tv/TB, if you want to subscribe.
[02:06:42.600 --> 02:06:45.720]   And for instance, when Windows 11,
[02:06:45.720 --> 02:06:47.480]   the Windows 11 announcement comes out,
[02:06:47.480 --> 02:06:49.560]   we're gonna stream that live on Thursday morning,
[02:06:49.560 --> 02:06:52.160]   but immediately after I'll make a short little version of it.
[02:06:52.160 --> 02:06:53.480]   So if you don't have time to watch
[02:06:53.480 --> 02:06:54.800]   the long Microsoft announcement,
[02:06:54.800 --> 02:06:57.320]   you can watch a quick update on that.
[02:06:57.320 --> 02:07:01.280]   Twit.tv/TB, not exactly a show.
[02:07:01.280 --> 02:07:03.360]   It, because it doesn't have any particular time
[02:07:03.360 --> 02:07:04.920]   of recording or release.
[02:07:04.920 --> 02:07:08.760]   It's just whenever tech news breaks,
[02:07:08.760 --> 02:07:10.080]   we'll be there breaking it.
[02:07:10.080 --> 02:07:14.920]   Thank you, Andy, Alex, Renee.
[02:07:14.920 --> 02:07:16.360]   Thank you so much, great to see you.
[02:07:16.360 --> 02:07:17.320]   We'll see you all next time.
[02:07:17.320 --> 02:07:19.720]   Now get back to work 'cause break time,
[02:07:19.720 --> 02:07:20.560]   this is over.
[02:07:20.560 --> 02:07:21.680]   Hey, what's going on everybody?
[02:07:21.680 --> 02:07:24.960]   I am Ant Pruitt, and I want to tell you about my show,
[02:07:24.960 --> 02:07:28.200]   Hands on Photography Here on Twit.tv.

[02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:32.560]   I'd like to sit down and share with you
[02:07:32.560 --> 02:07:34.840]   the best tips and tricks that are gonna help
[02:07:34.840 --> 02:07:36.760]   make you a better photographer.
[02:07:36.760 --> 02:07:38.760]   And it's not always about Photoshop,
[02:07:38.760 --> 02:07:41.560]   it's not always about just having the biggest
[02:07:41.560 --> 02:07:43.640]   and baddest and bestest camera.
[02:07:43.640 --> 02:07:46.120]   It can be the simplest of things like,
[02:07:46.120 --> 02:07:48.400]   leave your eye open when you're looking
[02:07:48.400 --> 02:07:49.840]   through the viewfinder.
[02:07:49.840 --> 02:07:51.840]   All of these simple tips can really help
[02:07:51.840 --> 02:07:53.280]   step your photography game up.
[02:07:53.280 --> 02:07:54.880]   So subscribe to the show today,
