[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly and lo and behold just minutes before the show began.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Invitations started arriving for an Apple event next week.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   We'll take a look at what it all means next on Mac Break Weekly.

[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   This is Mac Break Weekly, episode 288, recorded February 28, 2012.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   Lord Apple Mote.

[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show that covers iOS.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   So there.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Joining us.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   It would be hard to say iOS weekly.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   So joining us right now, two people who got invited to the next Apple event and two people who didn't.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Not that we're bitter.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   We'll do something else.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Yes, Alex Lindsey is here from the pixelcore.com.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   That means we can stay up here in Petaluma.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   We can stay and cover it, which is exactly what we're going to do.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   Andy and Aco will be there. You're going to go fly out, right?
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Well, if I were to say that I'm flying out to San Francisco, that would be to confirm that I've been invited to an event
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   on a product that Apple has not officially announced yet.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   And on that basis, I'm uncomfortable with either confirming or denying my travel plans for the next week.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Well, I guess I won't send you a check then.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   And also joining us.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   No tickets coming to you, my friend.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Andy will be at the Puditive event.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Also here, Jason Snell, who can confirm without denying.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Jason is the editor-in-chief of Mac Run magazine.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   It's not in barcode in any way.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   I'm not in barcode in any way.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   And not even about Mountain Line, which is surprising.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Andy, are we still on for dinner on Wednesday night?
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Oh, good jeez!
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Yeah, the clam chowder at the Union Oyster House over Beacon Hill is just time of year.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   So here, the bells in the Northeast Church will really just...
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   Here's the invitation those guys got for the Year Bob Buena Center of the Arts.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   That's traditionally where the iPad 1 was announced.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   iPad 2 was announced and iPhones are announced.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   We're also announced.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   It's a little bit of a smaller theater in the Urbobuena Center.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   March 7th, 10 a.m.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   And of course, the parsing...
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Let the parsing begin.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Is that a retina display she is tapping?
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Sure looks like it.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Can you...
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Can you...
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   Look, Tal?
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   Looks very, very sharp.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Hey, Andy, is your iPad at that sharp?
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   Mm-hmm.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   This photo I think actually posed today.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   They mocked up with the iPad 2, what it would look like.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   And it's not a sharp.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Really?
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   So, that's probably the only way to do it.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   We can't really tell.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Um...
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   He loves his dog.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   It's so sweet to a geysia guy and his animals.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   So...
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   Things are not allowed to talk about.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   How could...
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Wait a minute, Andy.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   Let's be honest.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   You can say you got an invitation, can't you?
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   Uh, I can't say that I got an invitation.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   I don't think I can say that.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Why?
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   Okay, Jason.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Would you interpret the...
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   Our delegate from the Russian embassy and explain why he would be so embargoed when you are not.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   Does he have an eyes?
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   I mean, he has an eye.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   Um, well, it could be...
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   It could be that he hasn't gotten an invitation and is not going to complain about it.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   Is anybody to know?
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   Because he wants to...
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   Or because he's talking to Apple and suggesting that he would like to come.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   He's trying to figure out whether he can afford a last minute.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   No, well, I'm saying we'll fly you out.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Anyway, we'll figure it out.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   Off the air.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   Apple's ways are mysterious.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   Apple moves in mysterious ways, that is for sure.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   So, uh, the chat room says that they can deduce from this image that the new iPad 3 is triangular.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   [laughter]
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   It comes with a human hand.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   And comes with its own female hand.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   It's covered in sort of a sugary glaze.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   Also, it comes...it's sort of uplit from two inches below the bottom of the bezel.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   And only three apps.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   Only three apps.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   Only runs three apps.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   Keynote, calendar, and map.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   That's quite a combination.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   But they made that choice, obviously, because the map would help you find it.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   Find the event.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   The calendar tells you it's Wednesday, March 7th, and Keynote is...
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   And it's a Keynote.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   It's a Keynote.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   So that's...
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   Cheesus, we've cracked the code.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   There's no home button.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   No, of course not.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   The home button's on the left or right, depending on how you orientate.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   And that's at the bottom, right?
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   Presumably.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   This is in...in portrait.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Although some people speculate that it might not have a button on it.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   It might not, but probably will.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   But you can't tell from this picture.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   I don't think so.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   Could you?
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   No.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   There's no way to know.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   Or maybe I'm wrong, but isn't the doc at the bottom of the screen?
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   Yeah, so this is rotated in landscape.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   And you wouldn't see the button.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   The button would be on the left or right.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   Oh, they're saying, "Oh, maybe it's not in landscape."
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   But there's so many...
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   There's...out of the four possible rotations, three of which would have no home button.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   Right.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   And my feeling is that if you look where the text is placed here,
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   would you want a button getting in the way of the text that needs to be readable there?
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   So it's probably just an art direction decision.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   I don't know.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   I'm not gonna read much.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   It probably just Photoshopped it out.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   For the first iPad release, they didn't actually change the official Apple logo to a stencil
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   on the background of splattered paint color.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   So I think they went for a cool, easily cut and pasted image.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   But we could say one thing.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   The current iPad 2 has a silver edge, an aluminum edge,
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   and that is definitely a dark edge.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   Oh, do we have to do this?
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   Do we really have to do this?
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   Well, you don't think this is...
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   You think this is...
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   Are we really gonna be like Jim Carreson, like back and to the left?
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   They're tapping back and to the left.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   What does the significance of Wednesday mean?
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   But wait a minute.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   Come on.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   They're not gonna release an iPad that doesn't match this picture.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   Can I make a lot of...
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   Anagram of something to see?
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   S-O-M-Me.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   So mobile me is coming back.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   Hing, ting, ting.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   So there's gonna be a new audio codec, ting, that...
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   Or higher register.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   So maybe a new speaker system?
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   Guh.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   Sure.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   But what do you do when you say "guh"?
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   You when you're really astounded by something you haven't seen before,
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   like a retina projector built into the...
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   Guh!
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   Look, a retina projector.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   Okay, so a better speaker system, a projector system built into the edge of the display.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   I think that's a sugar glazing.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   That's probably not the gloss that comes from Gorilla Glass.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   But then I'm just speculating.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   Some of the criminology is ridiculous, but I mean, Apple wants us to see what they want us to see.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   This is a very carefully shot and manipulated and chosen picture.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   So you know, Apple likes having a little speculation, but you know,
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   and they know it's gonna go crazy.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   But that's fine.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   They want people in a fervor for...
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   I think the real question is when is it gonna show?
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   Eight days.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   Rumor is that the iPads have already left the building.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   Well, if we follow the pattern, then it would probably be the following, not that weekend,
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   but the weekend following, sort of like ten days out, if they follow the pattern.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   They don't always, but that would be my guess.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   'Cause once you want it out fast, because you don't want to kill the sales of the iPad too.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   So it could be that following weekend, sometimes within the next...
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   That's a good point.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   You can't wait too long 'cause the iPad too is not gonna sell for whatever period of time that is.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   Right. You only do the long range announcements if you don't...
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   If you're not killing an existing product with whatever you're doing.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   And it's not impossible to believe that they would ship it on the Saturday.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   No, right.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   It's possible.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   So somewhere between the seventh and the seventeenth, right?
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   It's possible that they could say as they have sometimes, walk down to the Apple Store and pick one up today.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   Yeah, given the secrecy of this product, they'll probably have a couple of days, I would think.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   But it could be that Friday or that Saturday, or the following Friday or Saturday.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   We had been preparing rumors last year, like in November, that they were already manufacturing these guys.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   So, I mean, they've got a stockpile somewhere.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   I don't think we need to say anymore about rumors that we've all talked ad nauseum about,
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   whether it's a quad-core, a dual-core, an A5X or an A6.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   The only thing that that invitation really tells us is that it's kind of as a retina display, yes?
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   That's the implication, right?
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   I mean, yeah.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   I think that would officially be Apple is screwing with everybody if they released that image
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   and did not intend for people to conclude that there's a retina display involved.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   That would be kind of going over the line.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   Like, if the image were of an eye and you could sort of see in the back of the eye,
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   it could be maybe they're being queued about, oh, well, no, it's not a retina display,
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   but we want to demonstrate that it's a better camera, so you're seeing better.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   We didn't even think that someone would think that it's a retina display,
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   but to release an image like that of a soup, what appears to be a higher resolution iPad screen,
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   that would be screwing.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   I think they should have used this image for the invitation.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   They're coming.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   They're Chinese playing.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   This is tweeted by somebody named Sonny Dixon.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   He says, "Look, pallets of iPads."
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   This is proof.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   This is proof.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   I don't know how proof I don't know how you could tell.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   I took a picture of some pallets going into a plane.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   Something.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   It happens pretty often, actually, around the world.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   It's very funny.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   Also, there are rumors that it's going to be $80 more.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   I don't know where that came from.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   Is that was it a leak to say Chinese micro-blogging platform?
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   Please.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   I don't even know.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   Okay.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   And that there would be two products, which is a reasonable speculation given that, you know,
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   the sense that they keep the iPad 2 around is a low-cost item given the pressure they're getting from the bottom.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   They've done that with the iPhone, so it's a total sense for the iPad, which is a more expensive product
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   because it's not subsidized.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   Why not keep the iPad 2 around and have it be a little cheaper?
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   No.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   Do we think there'd be $399 or $299?
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   Wow.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   I don't think they'd go as low as $299.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   I think they'd have to feel real pressure to break the $300 barrier.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   I split the difference.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   I was $349.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   I think that's a great number.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   I think the thing if Apple is intending to go for a cheaper one, they would go for $349 or $399.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   They don't have to press that far to sort of tip the boat.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   They don't have to kill the Kindle Fire.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   They just have to kill every other Android tablet that's selling for $300 to $399.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   Because I have to say that if they did $299, there would be no oxygen left.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   That would be...
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   Give it up.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   The iPad 2 at $299 would be pretty much all the oxygen gone.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   As strong as the Kindle Fire is, well, we saw an interesting revelation at mobile world Congress.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   It was called Mac World Congress.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   A mobile world Congress from Samsung executive who said that, "Yeah, we can't sell these tablets."
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   You didn't say quite like that, but that was a strong implication.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   They're not doing that well.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   The only tablet at all that's threatening Apple is the Kindle Fire.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   But I don't think you need to go to...
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   Why let them have $200?
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   Why not give it to them?
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   Why do you care?
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   Apple likes to make money on the products they sell.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   So having the margin there is good.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   Apple's...
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   The iPad is not hurting now at $499.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   Even if you went down to $399, it would be huge news, I think.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   Robert's pointing out, Robert Bigelow in her chatroom is that the refurbs from the Apple Online Store are $299.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   So I don't know if that gives you a price.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   Well, the other consideration is that once they drop the price, they can never raise it again for any reason.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   So given that Tim Cooks was asked this question kind of directly about pressure from Android tablets,
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   and specifically from the Fire and said, "We don't feel as though it's stealing any sales away from the iPad in any way, shape, form."
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   That's a clear indication that they don't feel any pressure to make any moves in response to other tablets from the market right now.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   Now, does that assertion that they can't raise the price also apply to this $80 increase?
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   In other words, do you think... Because that is raising the price on the iPad.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   I would be surprised if they raised the level of the buy-in for the iPad.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   They still need a $499, you mean?
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   I think that if this rumor is true, I think that would mean that there is going to be a retinability display that would be more expensive
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   and a standard quality display that would hold the line at $499.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   Who would buy?
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   Or possibly go down.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   Who would not buy a $499?
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   Who would not spend $80 bucks for the iPad?
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   It gets you in the door, though. That low price gets you in the door.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   It does, right?
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   Oh, it's now $399 and you end up with a $600.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   No, I think they should do an iPad 2 at 350.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   Right.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   350 is what I would say.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   That's clear.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   And that's for education, too.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   If you're going to push this textbook initiative, for instance, the high school that I am on the board of, my kids go to, is making this exact decision right now.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   Apple's discontinued the polycarbonate MacBook that they've been giving.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   They do a one-to-one program.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   They get a laptop, so they have to replace it.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   The air is more expensive, so they're looking at the iPad.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   They're also looking at Chromebooks.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   Those are the three kind of choices that are out there for them.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   Chromebook is very appealing from a cost point of view.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   It's $20 per student per month.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   And something goes wrong.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   They give you a different one.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   But you talk $350 for an iPad 2.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   Part of the concern with an iPad is breakability.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   But at $350, that's less of a concern.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   Right.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   And I also think that when you look at the iBook's author from a school's perspective, they have to factor that in.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   Well, what it means, if you can get it low enough, is that you could have both.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   You give them a Chromebook and an iPad with the textbooks on it.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   You see what I'm saying?
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   I don't think they're going to do that.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   I think that I think that the right now, unless someone does something pretty decisive, I think that the iPad is going to start becoming a standard in corporations and education.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   It means a keyboard for school.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   Well, not necessarily.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   Kids aren't going to write a paper.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   I'm glad.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   Yeah, but they got their computers at home for that.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   They don't necessarily need to have the thing that they're toning around from classroom to classroom.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   Really, the killer app for a classroom computer is the courseware and not necessarily preparing these things.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   Also, writing is taking, I don't know if it's a backseat to presentations right now, but it's almost unequal footing as being able to simply stand up for 10 minutes and explain the solar system instead of having to write a three page paper on it and copy.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   Take photocopies out of the encyclopedia of Britannica for your media content.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   I hate to tell you, but schools are not abandoning the requirement to write a lot.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   I don't think they're abandoning it, but it's not going away.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   I can tell you, as a member of the board of trustees, I'm not letting it go away.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   Kids need to learn how to write.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   I have to admit that if I was in school right now, if I was in high school, I'd be dictating everything.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   There's no way I would type really.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   I mean, I dictate most of anything long for now.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   Correct it without a keyboard.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   That's a pain in the butt.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   It depends on how good you are.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   You can also just use a keyboard.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   I mean, the iPad does work fine with keyboard.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   That's what I've been telling them.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   I'm saying if you buy iPads, add $100 because you're going to buy an external keyboard.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   Maybe not one to one, but yeah.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   But again, what if they're relying on the computers they have at home?
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   You can't assume that you can never assume that a kid has a computer at home.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   That's not allowed.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   You're giving a computer because they may not have a computer at home.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   You want them to have a computer.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   I think that to back up just a second, we remember that Apple's been building the iPad
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   too and they've been sourcing that screen for a couple of years now.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   If there's any iPad in the line that could possibly be driven down in price, not necessarily
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   this year, but maybe next year, it would be the iPad too or any iPad that has that standard
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   definition to screen.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   We're asked the ones that require this new component, they're probably going to be in
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   scarce supply as they start to ramp up.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   It's probably a lot more expensive to manufacture.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   That's the one where there's no way in hell they can possibly submarine the price any
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   lower than the introduction price.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   So it's possible that maybe they'll keep this one at sort of a slight, at the same
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   price with the idea that when it comes time for holiday sales, that's when they stick people with
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   $250 or the $300 or the $350 new price.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   Well, we'll all know soon.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   Victory.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   We will know in eight days.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   I thought to you, sir.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   We will know.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   That's the good news.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   March 7th is the official date.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   We've been planning for this.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   We'll do live coverage, of course, of the event.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   And if Andy should get an invitation and show up, maybe we'll be talking to him otherwise,
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   Jason, would you like to join us?
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   I'll be down there.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   What we need and what we like to do, and we presume is that there will be a lot of
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   room after the keynote that somebody can go over.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   Right.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   And there usually is.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   It's one of you two guys.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   Whoever has an invitation can do that.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   And for the answer to that question, tune in to the Twit TV reality TV show, which we
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   compete.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   You guys have to fight it off.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   I'm Phoenix, Elsior, Jason, representing Team Birch Park.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   But one thing we know for sure, Alex and I will be sitting here.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   Yes.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   In lovely Petaluma.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   Absolutely.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   Well, you'll be even in town.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   I'm actually coming back just for this.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   Just for this?
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   Awesome.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   Awesome.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   So we will have live coverage starting.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   We'll start around 9.30 AM Pacific.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   The event starts at 10 AM.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   And we've already moved security now to Tuesday for next week.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   Steve Gibson volunteered already.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   He said, "You know?"
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   I said, "Yes."
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   Why?
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   Playing on it.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   So I'm glad that they're actually doing it.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   George Lopez volunteered to move his show to midnight after Conan.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   I volunteer.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   Actually, I can't wait.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.160]   I hope it's a retina display.
[00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:26.160]   I think it is.
[00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:28.160]   And I cannot wait to get one.
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:31.440]   We spent a lot of time parsing and dribbling and so forth.
[00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:38.400]   But I think this is a retina display on a tablet that size.
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:41.200]   Can we think about what that would look like?
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:42.840]   It's a higher DPI than anything we've seen.
[00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:44.760]   I think it would look like an iPhone, but bigger.
[00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:46.680]   It's a lot of pixels, too.
[00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:48.520]   If you think about it, turn your pixels.
[00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:49.520]   It's two megapixels, is it?
[00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:51.560]   I-- math is not my skill, but--
[00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:52.560]   Calculator.
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:53.560]   But it would be enormous.
[00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:55.040]   It's actually a three megapixels, I believe.
[00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:56.040]   Yeah.
[00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:57.040]   Yeah.
[00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:01.640]   So there has to be a lot of graphics power in that thing just to push all those pixels.
[00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:05.760]   Because it'll be greater than a 1080 HD.
[00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:09.560]   It's 3.1415.
[00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:10.560]   It's Pi pixels.
[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:11.560]   Pi megapixels.
[00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:12.560]   Pi megapixels.
[00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:13.560]   Pi megapixels.
[00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:14.560]   Pi megapixels.
[00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:15.560]   It's close.
[00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:17.400]   It's a new custard display from Apple.
[00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:19.440]   Tim Cook's going to come out and say, "Okay, who wants Pi?"
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:21.560]   It is literally 3.14 megapixels.
[00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:22.560]   3.145 megapixels.
[00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:25.560]   But the 5 is when it goes off the reservation.
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:30.960]   If you imagine reading on an iPhone, I mean, picture the clarity of text reading on an
[00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:31.960]   iPad, and then the one--
[00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:34.280]   Is it the same GPI as an iPhone?
[00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:35.280]   Well, it's unclear.
[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:38.680]   It's double what the iPad is.
[00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:40.680]   Yeah, but it's not-- I don't believe it's actually--
[00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:42.320]   It's a little less than a little less.
[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:43.800]   The DPI is a little less.
[00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:46.120]   Yeah, it's written up because you hold it further away.
[00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:47.760]   And then it's imperceptible.
[00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:51.040]   But Andy, as a comic book reader, I mean, what struck me?
[00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:52.040]   Oh, imagine that.
[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:53.040]   It is.
[00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:54.520]   I mean, the file balance is going to be huge.
[00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:58.320]   But magazines and comic books on this, the quality of the images you're going to be able
[00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:00.560]   to get over the iPad, which is not bad.
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:02.080]   But you can see the pixels.
[00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:05.360]   And on this new one, I just try to imagine that.
[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:07.080]   And it could be very cool.
[00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:08.080]   Well, as you still--
[00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:11.400]   It'll certainly elevate everything that's being presented on the iPad.
[00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:17.920]   But the problem with a comic book app is that a company like Comicsology, they're not beholden
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:21.960]   to the technology that beholden to Marvel and DC who may not be willing to release such
[00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:23.120]   high definition--
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:24.120]   Right.
[00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:25.120]   --at Tate-Frizzu.
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:28.280]   Because not realize that every single iPad has that really cool screen capture mode.
[00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:34.120]   And if they want to-- they're essentially giving people the permission to have three megapixel
[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:39.240]   screen images of every digitally crisp and pure to then spend all of 20 minutes combining
[00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:41.640]   into a CBR or a CBZ file and then uploading.
[00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:44.120]   So they may put the kibosh on that.
[00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:45.320]   It'll be interesting to see.
[00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:48.520]   It's like having high quality iTunes music files or something like that.
[00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:52.000]   Also, Comicsology and companies like that are going to have to decide, they're going
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   to have to detect, oh, you're on a retina display.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   So we'll download this.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.320]   Do you want us to download this giant comic file that's going to take forever to download
[00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:01.080]   versus just the lower quality one that we can download fast?
[00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:02.080]   Yeah.
[00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:05.880]   One of the other questions is what sizes of-- what memory are we going to see built into
[00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:06.880]   this?
[00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:11.280]   Because I think that if you're starting to look at putting out books and anything-- anything,
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:13.720]   all the apps, everything is going to be much larger.
[00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:14.720]   Yeah.
[00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:17.800]   It seems like a text, a 3G or even a 4G.
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:21.320]   Well, I'm just talking about the-- I think you have to be looking at a 120.
[00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:24.920]   I think one of the reasons that we might see a size increase is possibly putting some
[00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:28.520]   of the memory that they're using for the netbooks into it.
[00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:33.480]   I mean, I think that in some ways you have to start thinking about 128 and 256 gigabytes
[00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:35.880]   of RAM, at least 128.
[00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:39.240]   I think that I'd be very surprised if we don't see 128.
[00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:48.120]   Yeah, so 2048 by 1536 on a 10.1 inch screen is a pixel per inch of 253.
[00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:51.320]   The iPhone is 164.
[00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:52.320]   Can that be written?
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:53.320]   That's the original iPhone.
[00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:54.320]   That's the original iPhone.
[00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:55.720]   I need the retina display.
[00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:56.720]   Here we go.
[00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:57.720]   There's the retina.
[00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:58.720]   There's the--
[00:21:58.720 --> 00:21:59.720]   It's stubble.
[00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:00.720]   It's 329.
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:01.720]   Yeah.
[00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:02.720]   So it's not as high DPI as the iPhone.
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:03.720]   Close enough for government work.
[00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:04.720]   It is.
[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:05.720]   Government work.
[00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:06.720]   Double what we have now.
[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:07.720]   Wow.
[00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:17.400]   But if I remember back in my print days, an art magazine is 175 to 200--
[00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:19.640]   This is more than that.
[00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:20.640]   I mean, we didn't--
[00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:21.640]   250.
[00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:24.160]   Very rarely did we see a magazine printed any higher resolution than that.
[00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:25.160]   What's 9.7 is?
[00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:26.160]   Time magazine or 133.
[00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:29.760]   So it's 263 DPI on the 9.7.
[00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:30.760]   Pretty close.
[00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:31.760]   That's great.
[00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:32.760]   It's going to look really good.
[00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:33.760]   That's all it looks like.
[00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:38.480]   I mean, you think about the things that will hit the consumer first off.
[00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:42.120]   It's going to be the clarity of the display, even if it's just the Kindle app, even if
[00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:43.680]   it's just the iBooks app.
[00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:49.240]   The fact that they can get large print full screen display that is absolutely flawless.
[00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:53.840]   Not only that, but now we can finally get like a two up display with the actual page
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:58.520]   turns in which both pages are in ultra high definition and look like reading like a regular
[00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:00.240]   paperback book.
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:05.320]   I'm not even 100% convinced that Apple has anything really major new planned to exploit
[00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:10.080]   the higher definition iPad display beyond high definition movies.
[00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:14.400]   It's just enough to make sure that every time you look at this screen, you are impressed
[00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:19.920]   with how beautiful and how wonderful and luxurious the readability of this device is.
[00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:26.800]   If you have a 20-- Apple 27 just to put this as perspective, it's less than half the DPI
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:28.520]   of the new iPad.
[00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:29.520]   It's a lower resolution.
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:31.840]   Your 27-inch iMac is doing--
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:32.840]   2560.
[00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:33.840]   Oh, is it doing 2560?
[00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:34.840]   Yeah.
[00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:37.480]   But the smaller iMac, I think, has fewer pixels than the iPad.
[00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:38.680]   I'm talking about the big 27-inch.
[00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:42.880]   The big 27-inch is 1920 by 1080.
[00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:47.600]   Which leads one to the question, I would guess that Apple will be doing this across
[00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:48.600]   the board, right?
[00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:49.760]   They'll start doing it on.
[00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:54.520]   Can you get LCDs that are retina for that size?
[00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:57.520]   I'm saying if you have $100 billion, you can get anything on it.
[00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:59.520]   I do think that's where they're going.
[00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:01.520]   I think that's where they're going.
[00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:04.240]   I mean, now we're in a different world.
[00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:07.560]   Well, when you start-- and also when you start thinking about the possibility of an Apple
[00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:11.360]   TV and whether the F42-inch Apple TV and whether they make that how high resolution
[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:12.360]   do they make that?
[00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:14.960]   But that doesn't matter for TV because no content is going to take advantage of that,
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:15.960]   right?
[00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:18.440]   And you're far enough back that really 1080 is going to do you.
[00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:22.160]   But on your laptop to have double resolution on a laptop, have the text be that much crisper?
[00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:23.160]   Yeah.
[00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:26.760]   As long as everything's fast, I mean, the hard part is that as long as it's crisper and not
[00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:29.000]   smaller because that's the biggest problem I have right now.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   That's the trick, right?
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.440]   They can make it higher resolution.
[00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:36.600]   Now, my 11-inch air that I have right here is higher resolution than most Apple products
[00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:37.840]   were before.
[00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:40.040]   And I had to crank up the fonts because everything's smaller.
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:44.600]   But if they do a double resolution and they can just pixel-double it, then you're making
[00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:45.600]   a retina display.
[00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:47.720]   Here's the gizmodo comparison that you mentioned.
[00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:51.720]   On the right would be a standard iPad on the left would be the--
[00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:52.720]   Yeah, it's great.
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:53.720]   They posed.
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:56.600]   They got a finger, a fat finger, but it's a finger.
[00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:57.600]   And that's pretty clear.
[00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:02.680]   You could see the fact that the aliasing on the 7.
[00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:03.680]   I think it's pretty clear.
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:07.800]   The calendar is not nearly as clear, although that could be an artifact of the camera angle.
[00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:09.640]   It's hard to tell.
[00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:10.640]   It's hard to tell.
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:12.640]   But it looks awfully clear that, again, photos can--
[00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:13.640]   Well, that's the problem.
[00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:14.640]   Let me tell you a picture.
[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:15.640]   Let's take a picture.
[00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:18.960]   This is the image Apple chose, and it's imparting clarity on the screen.
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:19.960]   That's what that picture--
[00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:23.560]   Well, look at the fingerprints on the left versus the fingerprint on the right.
[00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:25.480]   I mean, I think there is a clarity.
[00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:30.480]   Notice the man with the trench coat who opens his umbrella at frame number 1.
[00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:32.480]   All right, Andy hates this crap.
[00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:33.480]   I'm just saying.
[00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:34.480]   I got it.
[00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:36.480]   That was one magic iPad.
[00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:39.480]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:43.480]   Andy could take his cynic sauce, and we'll continue on.
[00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:45.480]   It is your right.
[00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:49.480]   It's not called-- it's not called mag rumor weekly.
[00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:51.480]   It's just the facts, man.
[00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:52.480]   Yeah.
[00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:53.480]   Just the facts.
[00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:59.480]   This show brought to you today by the folks at Citrix, and go to my PC.
[00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:01.480]   Do not be fooled by the name.
[00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:03.480]   They really ought to rename it.
[00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:04.480]   Go to my Mac.
[00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:05.480]   Go to my Mac.
[00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:06.480]   It's the same.
[00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:08.480]   Go to my PC.com.
[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:13.480]   And even better, maybe go to my Mac with my iPhone.com.
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:17.480]   Go to my PC is the missing link for mode access.
[00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:21.480]   It will turn your iPad and now your iPhone into your office computer.
[00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:23.480]   And that is mind boggling.
[00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:29.480]   Imagine you know your office I was yesterday in a mad dash to the airport, and you forgot
[00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:32.480]   your keynote present to El my-- it's on the computer.
[00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:33.480]   Oh, my goodness.
[00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:34.480]   What am I going to do?
[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:37.480]   You fire up, go to my PC on your iPhone.
[00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:38.480]   Wait till you get to the airport.
[00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:39.480]   And there it is.
[00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:40.480]   You can download it.
[00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:41.480]   You can access it.
[00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:42.480]   You can edit it.
[00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:43.480]   You can send and receive an email.
[00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:45.480]   I mean, it's convenient.
[00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:46.480]   It's reliable.
[00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:48.480]   It works on the iPad.
[00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:49.480]   Wow.
[00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:50.480]   The iPad 3 is going to be amazing for this.
[00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:51.480]   It's going to be amazing.
[00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:52.480]   It's going to be amazing.
[00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:53.480]   Go to my PC.
[00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:56.480]   It's a lifesaver when you're away from the office.
[00:26:56.480 --> 00:27:00.480]   You have access to your entire office computer, right in your pocket Mac or Windows.
[00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:02.480]   And you can try it free right now.
[00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:05.480]   If you visit go to my PC.com, the offer code is Mac break.
[00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:08.480]   So click the try it free button right there.
[00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:10.480]   And use the offer code Mac break.
[00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:15.480]   And then once you've got it, go download the free app on your iPhone and iPad.
[00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:16.480]   Make sure you have it.
[00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:21.480]   Because you never know when you're going to need to access that office computer.
[00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:24.480]   It's a little weird to run Windows 7 on an iPhone, but you can.
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:25.480]   You can.
[00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:26.480]   That's what's amazing.
[00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:30.480]   And on the Retin display, it's actually very usable, but I cannot wait to see it on a Retin
[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:31.480]   on an iPad 3.
[00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:32.480]   This will be a good time to try it out.
[00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:33.480]   Go to my PC.com.
[00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:34.480]   Offer code is Mac break.
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:37.480]   30 days free unlimited use.
[00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:40.480]   And then, by the way, get the free apps so that you can try it out.
[00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:45.480]   And also for those of you who are iconic class, it also works on Android.
[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:48.480]   And I just suddenly realized how much easier it's going to be to share through your iPad
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:49.480]   when it's that resolution.
[00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:50.480]   Oh, yeah.
[00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:51.480]   Because you're sharing to a desktop machine.
[00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:52.480]   Yeah.
[00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:54.480]   Really, because the 1024x768, it's a little bit.
[00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:56.480]   It's tough, but double that resolution.
[00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:59.480]   You have more resolution on your iPad than you actually have on the desktop.
[00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:01.480]   You'll have room for a keyboard.
[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:02.480]   I mean, it'll be amazing.
[00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:03.480]   Can't wait.
[00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:06.480]   And they handle that, of course, transparently and beautifully.
[00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:10.480]   I don't, you know, of course they'll have to update the app though, right?
[00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:14.480]   Now, that's what's going to be a question mark is will apps, when we already see doubling
[00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:17.480]   from iPhone to iPad, it works okay.
[00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:19.480]   Some apps better than those.
[00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:20.480]   Text heavy apps were great.
[00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:22.480]   Graphics not so well.
[00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:23.480]   Right.
[00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:27.480]   This happened with the iPhone 4 transition where the Redis display came out and all the
[00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:31.480]   app developers rushed to drop in 2x graphics for their iPhone apps.
[00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:33.480]   Now, they've kind of known about this for a while, I think.
[00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:38.480]   I think you, if you're an app developer, you've had your iPad 2x graphics ready to go.
[00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:40.480]   Knowing that this was probably going to happen.
[00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:41.480]   Why not?
[00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:43.480]   And they'll get presumably, you know, maybe a week later.
[00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:48.480]   Ten days, I would imagine you'll see a lot of updates for iPad apps saying, you know,
[00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:50.480]   ads written to graphics for the iPad 3.
[00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:54.480]   Because oftentimes there is an opportunity to get featured on the app store.
[00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:55.480]   Right.
[00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:57.480]   If you are following a lot of the line.
[00:28:57.480 --> 00:28:58.480]   It's a lot of concern.
[00:28:58.480 --> 00:28:59.480]   Yeah.
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:02.480]   And it's, that's worth tens of thousands of dollars just to upgrade your graphics.
[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:04.480]   I think they're going to work it out.
[00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:07.480]   It's a little more challenging if you're a game, if you're infinity blade and you have a lot
[00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:09.480]   of assets that you have to upgrade.
[00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:10.480]   Right.
[00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:13.480]   At 20, 48 by 1536.
[00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:14.480]   Plants versus zombies.
[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:15.480]   Keep the feed.
[00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:16.480]   If they do.
[00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:17.480]   Now that's okay.
[00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:18.480]   That's the other question.
[00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:22.040]   That's why you got to get a faster processor or maybe not a faster processor.
[00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:24.480]   Maybe the 5x is an improved GPU.
[00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:25.480]   Right.
[00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:26.480]   Right.
[00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:28.480]   A lot of improvements are going to be needed in the graphics performance.
[00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:29.480]   It's the GPU.
[00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:30.480]   Because there are so many pixels.
[00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:31.480]   Right.
[00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:32.480]   Right.
[00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:33.480]   Or both.
[00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:34.480]   Or both.
[00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:35.480]   What's your, what's your position on the quad core question?
[00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:36.480]   Because there's debate.
[00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:37.480]   Wow.
[00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:39.480]   You know, I don't think Apple's ever going to do a quad core because they've been doing
[00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:42.480]   it for because they feel like they need the feature, feature box.
[00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:43.480]   Right.
[00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:46.480]   It would be because they figured out in their chip development that they can take advantage
[00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:47.480]   of those four cores.
[00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:48.480]   That's a really good question.
[00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:52.480]   Because the multiple core thing always comes down to can you split up the job.
[00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:53.480]   Right.
[00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:54.480]   Into four different tasks.
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:56.480]   Otherwise those cores just sort of sit there.
[00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:58.480]   Or, you know, or you can shut them down and save some power.
[00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:01.480]   So that's, but they're never going to do it just because of a checklist.
[00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:03.480]   Because they're like, oh geez, the competition's got four cores.
[00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:06.480]   It would be because they figured out some way which they'd probably say on stage.
[00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:08.480]   It's like, here's why four cores are important.
[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:13.480]   And then they make a big deal about the iPad 2 having nine times better graphics performance.
[00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:14.480]   Right.
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:15.480]   The graphics performance.
[00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:16.480]   That's what they're going to say.
[00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:17.480]   That's what they're going to say.
[00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:18.480]   And they're going to need.
[00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:19.480]   Frankly.
[00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:21.480]   They will need it if they do a retinence play.
[00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:24.480]   And there are ways to increase graphics performance without going to four cores.
[00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:26.480]   You can simply beef up the graphics processor.
[00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:30.480]   And as well as Jason points out, four cores isn't necessarily four times faster.
[00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:31.480]   You have to thread everything.
[00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:32.480]   Right.
[00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:34.480]   Developers have to go along for the ride.
[00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:39.480]   The iPad, despite its tag is a multitasking device really isn't a multitasking device.
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:41.480]   You pretty much do one thing at a time.
[00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:44.480]   So more cores isn't necessarily going to make a big difference.
[00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:47.480]   Only when you chop up those jobs into little pieces that you can feed.
[00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:49.480]   And that's up to the app developers.
[00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:50.480]   Mostly, yeah.
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:51.480]   You can really see that.
[00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:56.480]   Like if you're looking at something like compressor, when you effectively cut those cores up, which is using QMaster and so on and so forth.
[00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:57.480]   But it's designed to do that.
[00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:58.480]   I know.
[00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:03.480]   When you see an app that's designed to do it, it completely changes the speed at which you're working.
[00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:06.480]   So it's worth it, but it does take very specific.
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:10.480]   Like compressor by itself doesn't natively take full advantage of all the cores in the computer.
[00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:12.480]   You have to build a QMaster.
[00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:13.480]   Yeah.
[00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:16.480]   If you export out a quick time player, that's why it seems so interminable.
[00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:18.480]   It tends to use one core.
[00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:24.480]   It means you can export four things in the same time as one, but you can't export one thing four times.
[00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:27.480]   Well, and good luck doing that on an iPad because it just isn't going to support it.
[00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:30.480]   Well, an iPad is fundamentally one thing that's running in the foreground.
[00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:31.480]   So that's the argument against that.
[00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:34.480]   Increase the G. You got more transistors, put it into the GPU.
[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:35.480]   That's where you.
[00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:41.480]   Now, of course, one of the other big announcements at Mobile World Congress was Photoshop Touch,
[00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:43.480]   a Photoshop for the iPad.
[00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:46.480]   The iPad was already on Android, I think, but nobody knew.
[00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:49.480]   Well, there's no other Photoshop Express on both platforms.
[00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:52.480]   This is supposed to be more Photoshop than anything else.
[00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:54.480]   I spent some good quality time with it last night.
[00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:55.480]   Is it available already?
[00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:56.480]   It's available.
[00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:57.480]   Yep.
[00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:58.480]   I downloaded it.
[00:31:58.480 --> 00:31:59.480]   I played with it.
[00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:01.480]   I guess people wanted to make sure I did this before Mac.
[00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:02.480]   I'm kind of dreaming.
[00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:03.480]   I don't want to steal your pick.
[00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:04.480]   Is this going to be your pick?
[00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:05.480]   It is.
[00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:07.480]   So we don't have to go into great detail.
[00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:09.480]   We'll let you do a full review.
[00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:13.480]   I guess one question would be really interested to see if it handled multiple cores, you know,
[00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:14.480]   how well it did four cores.
[00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:16.480]   Because that's the kind of program you need.
[00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:18.480]   You know, you're doing a Gaussian blur.
[00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:22.480]   If it can thread it to four cores, you can make a big difference in performance.
[00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:27.480]   And it's current structure, what I can't say is it just does about everything as fast as you're moving.
[00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:29.480]   I mean, I didn't see any.
[00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:30.480]   Is it nice that too?
[00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:31.480]   I don't know.
[00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:34.480]   I was trying to do smart selections with it.
[00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:40.480]   It's more of a version of Photoshop Express than Photoshop elements.
[00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:41.480]   I'm sorry than the real Photoshop.
[00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:48.480]   So a lot of the cool features where you get to extract something from its background are the highlight features.
[00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:51.480]   So I was trying to use that last night, as a matter of fact, with this very picture.
[00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:56.480]   And if you do a very rough selection using that tool, it kind of keeps up with you when you're trying to refine it, though,
[00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:58.480]   even on the iPad too.
[00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:01.480]   It was keeping up, but not really.
[00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:03.480]   And it got a little bit annoying to use.
[00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:12.480]   I already felt myself trying to think that are there other ways I can achieve this effect that don't involve me having to use this feature that is frustrating me just a little tiny bit.
[00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:15.480]   And speaking of multi-core, this is an iPad 2 only app.
[00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:18.480]   And I think one of the reasons is probably that that's the dual core processor.
[00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:19.480]   It's in that iPad 2.
[00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:25.480]   Well, I think if this is any measure, and I admit it's purely anecdotal and it's a small sample.
[00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:29.480]   But Brandt Hogg in our chatroom says I'm going to have to stop watching this show.
[00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:33.480]   I might have to buy an iPad now.
[00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:36.480]   So I think Apple's making the right moves.
[00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:37.480]   So is Adobe.
[00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:39.480]   Shareholders meeting last week.
[00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:42.480]   The only big story is no dividend.
[00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:45.480]   There was some fun with $100 billion in cash.
[00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:46.480]   You might want to give some of that.
[00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:47.480]   Shocking.
[00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:48.480]   They're so--
[00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:53.480]   So I'm going to say they don't want to drain the executive pool down to the 8-foot cash level.
[00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:54.480]   They want to keep it at the 12-foot cash level.
[00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:57.480]   So they can still use the high dive board when they dive into the big thing.
[00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:58.480]   So here's the big thing.
[00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:00.480]   I love this picture from the shareholders meeting.
[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:02.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:04.480]   Fast asleep.
[00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:10.480]   I just find Tim Cook to be so diplomatic about this whole thing.
[00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:11.480]   Like just be patient.
[00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:12.480]   We're really, really thinking about it.
[00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:15.480]   It's a nice way of saying we're not going to do anything about it, which is what I would--
[00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:23.480]   what I would say, if, of course, if I was CEO of Apple, I would say if you don't think that the returns that you're getting from Apple's stock is worth it, you should go invest somewhere else.
[00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:24.480]   It is.
[00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:27.480]   It hasn't exactly put a damper on the price, has it?
[00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:33.480]   I mean, if you don't think that we're returning, we are the largest company in the world giving you the returns of a small upstart.
[00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:36.480]   As far as your stock value, screw you.
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:38.480]   You know, that would be pretty much mine.
[00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:39.480]   He says, "Are cash?"
[00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:42.480]   He does have some message that they're being responsible about it.
[00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:43.480]   I know.
[00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:44.480]   I think he's always the question.
[00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:45.480]   It's like people are like, "What's Apple doing?
[00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:46.480]   They don't ever say."
[00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:49.480]   And so now they've got this new message, which is, "Look, we're always thinking about it.
[00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:51.480]   We're not just putting it into the ground."
[00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:52.480]   I don't know if it's always the right word.
[00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:54.480]   He says, "We just counted all day long."
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:59.480]   I'd be the first to admit we have more cash than we need to run the daily business.
[00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:01.480]   So we're actively discussing a dividend.
[00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:07.480]   I can only ask for a bit of patience so we can do it in a way that's best for the shareholders.
[00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:09.480]   On cash, we've been thinking about cash very deeply.
[00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:12.480]   The board has been looking into what is in shareholder-ish best interests.
[00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:19.480]   My message is, "Board and the management team are thinking about this very deeply, and we will do what we think is in the best interest of the shareholders."
[00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:20.480]   Yeah.
[00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:22.480]   I mean, of course.
[00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:24.480]   That's a non-admissioned mission.
[00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:26.480]   It's just like we're not going to do anything.
[00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:28.480]   We'll do what's right for you.
[00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:46.480]   I think the thing is, I'm not an Apple shareholder partially because of the show, but I think that allowing Apple to make sure that it has the freedom to do anything that it needs to do in its business, which means we're tired of dealing with AT&T.
[00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:53.480]   We want to build our own network, or we want to run Wi-Fi into 20 cities and build a mesh grid to support our devices.
[00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:55.480]   Or we want to do those kinds of things.
[00:35:55.480 --> 00:36:05.480]   Not saying that they're going to do those things, but right now, for instance, if they decide they really wanted all the technology that Adobe has, you know, Adobe's market cap is, I think, what, $16 billion?
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:07.480]   They make that every quarter.
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:08.480]   That could buy Adobe, yeah.
[00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:10.480]   I mean, you know, that wouldn't...
[00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:13.480]   Just for disclosure purposes, you don't own Apple stock.
[00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:14.480]   I don't own Apple stock.
[00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:15.480]   I'm sure you don't own Apple stock.
[00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:17.480]   Do you have any Apple stock?
[00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:18.480]   No.
[00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:19.480]   All right.
[00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:20.480]   So just so you know, we got rid of Scott Born.
[00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:22.480]   He had more Apple stock than all of us combined.
[00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:30.480]   Actually, Scott, to his credit, sold his Apple stock entirely when he started doing this show or shortly thereafter.
[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:32.480]   And reminded us of it all the time.
[00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:33.480]   Yeah.
[00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:34.480]   It caused me.
[00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:35.480]   It caused me.
[00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:39.480]   Now, I don't know what it is with the New York Times and Apple.
[00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:42.480]   It seems like a bad breakup.
[00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:44.480]   Is that a fair description?
[00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:51.480]   The Times has become a cheerleader for the Apple can't possibly get any...
[00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:56.480]   You know, they're the ones who published the piece on the Apple's Factories.
[00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:59.480]   Now, there are two articles in the New York Times.
[00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:07.480]   One from, in the common sense column in Business Day, this is written by James B. Stewart saying,
[00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:11.480]   confronting the law of limits, Apple can't get any bigger.
[00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:19.480]   And another saying, this is an actual article from Kevin O'Brien, Apple's leading smartphones not guaranteed,
[00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:23.480]   is the Times doing its fiduciary responsibility and warning shareholders.
[00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:25.480]   Hey, this isn't going to continue forever.
[00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:27.480]   We've heard that before though, haven't we?
[00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:30.480]   I mean, when Apple was at $200, couldn't possibly...
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:32.480]   When it was at $300, couldn't get...
[00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:33.480]   So?
[00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:34.480]   So?
[00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:37.480]   It's now over $500 or is it still to go back down?
[00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:44.480]   There's a really nice takedown piece about the law of large numbers piece by a guy who goes by the nom de plume of Dr. Dr. Drang,
[00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:48.480]   who basically says that the guy who wrote that article doesn't know what the law of large numbers is.
[00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:50.480]   It has to do with averaging over time.
[00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:55.480]   And the money quote from him is, "If it worked the way that writer says it works,
[00:37:55.480 --> 00:38:00.480]   you could keep measuring how tall Dirk Novetzky was, and eventually he'd be $5.9."
[00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:02.480]   (laughter)
[00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:06.480]   So, you know, there's points in there that are true that Apple is so large that if you're looking for massive growth,
[00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:11.480]   it's sort of like that piece that said that Facebook's growth can't go on forever because they'll run out of people on planet Earth.
[00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:15.480]   It's true as far as it goes, but it's not what you think it is.
[00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:17.480]   Well, I think that the other issue...
[00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:23.480]   And Apple's been very clear that there's a large portion of planet Earth is next, and that's China,
[00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:29.480]   with their big... one of the big five features in Mountain Lion is Chinese localization.
[00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:30.480]   Yeah.
[00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:35.480]   That's kind of saying, "Hey, we know we're running out of Westerners, but there's a billion Chinese."
[00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:39.480]   And 85% of the phone market still doesn't have a smartphone or whatever it is, 80%.
[00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:40.480]   The talent is always...
[00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:41.480]   We're not always at the limits yet.
[00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:45.480]   And that's also assuming that Apple stays in just the phone market, which is, you know, there's no reason why...
[00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:49.480]   you know, they're already threatening to go into the TV market, and then there's other markets.
[00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:54.480]   And they, you know, at the size and with the cash that they have, they can do a lot of...
[00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:56.480]   they can go into a lot of markets very, very slowly.
[00:38:56.480 --> 00:39:00.480]   You know, like, as one gets eaten up, they can slowly move towards another one.
[00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:06.480]   So, even though his name is Dr. Drang, and the name of the blog is leancrew.com,
[00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:10.480]   I still got to give him a little bit of credit for correcting the James B. Stewart article,
[00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:15.480]   and I love this last paragraph he says, "And that, Mr. Stewart, is how you do air-you-dite.
[00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:17.480]   Leave the Bernoulli's alone.
[00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:22.480]   Stick with what you do best transcribing your credulous interviews with analysts."
[00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:23.480]   We know...
[00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:24.480]   Ow!
[00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:27.480]   You know, like the one near the end of the article with the analyst who thinks Microsoft is the company
[00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:29.480]   that best understands cloud computing.
[00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:31.480]   Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!
[00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:35.480]   Suddenly, it turned into an episode of America's next top model for some reason.
[00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:36.480]   [laughter]
[00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:38.480]   It's got a smackdown from Tyra.
[00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:41.480]   Dr. Drang says, "You're a full of it, New York Times."
[00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:44.480]   You do have to wonder, I mean, why is the New York Times all of a sudden?
[00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:46.480]   It's like, did you... what did that rumor?
[00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:53.480]   Is it the rumor that after they ran the work, the Foxconn, one that no one in Apple will return their call?
[00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:54.480]   Right.
[00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:58.480]   David Polk did get a briefing, a week early on Mountain Line,
[00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:00.480]   despite some of the questions.
[00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:01.480]   He's David Polk.
[00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:03.480]   And Apple has personal relationships, right?
[00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:04.480]   I mean, Stephen Levy got...
[00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:05.480]   It's personal, isn't it?
[00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:08.480]   Stephen Levy got briefings after he left Newsweek to go to Wired, and he still got brief.
[00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:13.480]   They didn't transfer Stephen Levy to somebody else at Newsweek, like Dan Lyons.
[00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:14.480]   No.
[00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:15.480]   That didn't happen.
[00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:19.480]   So, David Polk, you know, obviously is on Apple's list, and they'd like to talk to him.
[00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:23.480]   Well, I'm glad of that, because it means that Andy and Oco may or may not get an invitation,
[00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:27.480]   even though Apple hates me, that's good that they don't assign it to the organization,
[00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:29.480]   that it's not individuals.
[00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:36.480]   I far prefer that, so that we can at least continue to cover stuff through proxy via proxy.
[00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:39.480]   Even though none of us can actually go, not that we're bitter.
[00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:40.480]   It's fine, I don't care.
[00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:41.480]   But you're actually...
[00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:42.480]   Why am I going to put a little one?
[00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:43.480]   Did you ever get invitations?
[00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:45.480]   I got one through you.
[00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:46.480]   Okay.
[00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:47.480]   That's right.
[00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:48.480]   Oh, no, and I got a high-five.
[00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:49.480]   I will say the iPod sucks.
[00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:50.480]   I've had a couple.
[00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:51.480]   I've had a couple of like WWDCs.
[00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:52.480]   I think that's...
[00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:53.480]   Yeah, the high-five.
[00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:54.480]   You know, Apple is number one.
[00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:56.480]   They're like literally number one in every single category now.
[00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:59.480]   So if you're the New York Times or a newspaper or magazine...
[00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:00.480]   You shoot at them.
[00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:01.480]   This is...
[00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:02.480]   Right?
[00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:04.480]   It's like their editors having meetings saying, "Okay, Apple's not so big.
[00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:09.480]   Let's knock them down a few pegs and ask questions about this because we've got to challenge this."
[00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:15.480]   Which I think is healthy on one level to say, you know, just because there's been skepticism about Apple all along,
[00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:19.480]   now that Apple keeps getting larger, somebody should probably say, "Is this going to continue or not?"
[00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:20.480]   Right.
[00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:23.480]   Now, you can do that without getting the law of large numbers wrong.
[00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:28.480]   And the eye economy pieces where I think appropriate, in fact, Mike Daisy, as you might...
[00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:30.480]   I don't think we talked about it last week.
[00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:35.480]   Mike Daisy was the guy who started the whole thing because he got an iPhone with pictures of the workers.
[00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:38.480]   He wrote some articles about Foxconn, got a lot of press going.
[00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:39.480]   He has a monologue.
[00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:40.480]   His monologue.
[00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:42.480]   Mr. Daisy goes to Apple or something.
[00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:43.480]   I can remember saying that.
[00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:45.480]   And I think Agony and Next is Steve Jobs, I think is the name.
[00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:46.480]   That's right.
[00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:49.480]   And I think that these articles have benefited hundreds of thousands of Chinese.
[00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:50.480]   But let me finish this.
[00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:51.480]   Let me finish this.
[00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:58.480]   So, remember ABC Nightline got Foxconn factory access.
[00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:00.480]   And now there's a debate over whether...
[00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:04.480]   And it's pretty clear they got a packaged Foxconn piece.
[00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:11.480]   ABC is owned by Disney, if I'm not mistaken still.
[00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:12.480]   Yes.
[00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:14.480]   And I have a feeling that...
[00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:19.480]   I read an article by Mike in which he's land-based.
[00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:24.480]   The people who believe that the ABC story was credible and says this is no evidence whatsoever.
[00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:28.480]   And Apple's doing a PR job on here.
[00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:29.480]   So those eye...
[00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:34.480]   All of which I say is those eye economy pieces are probably well justified.
[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:39.480]   I think that they're well justified and I think that it's good for companies to...
[00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:40.480]   Good for Apple.
[00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:41.480]   It's good for Apple.
[00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:42.480]   I think it's also good for the workers.
[00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:45.480]   I think it's good for the industry to be paying attention to what's going on.
[00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:48.480]   Well, and if somebody's pointed out whether you believe in what Apple's done or not,
[00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:52.480]   it's the first company and the only company that makes stuff at Foxconn to step forward
[00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:54.480]   and say, "Well, let's do something about it."
[00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:57.480]   If I have a complaint about the way this coverage has been handled, again, it comes back to Apple
[00:42:57.480 --> 00:43:03.480]   riding high and being number one is that this is Foxconn manufactured stuff for all the major...
[00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:04.480]   Everybody's there.
[00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:10.480]   I think what Apple is bothered by is this perception that it's Apple who does this and nobody else does.
[00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:16.480]   When in fact, Apple is sort of getting singled out and in some ways has a better track record
[00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:20.480]   and seems like what they did with the Greenpeace stuff and the environmental issues is trying
[00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:24.480]   to turn it around and be a leader after not being and trying to just not say anything.
[00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:28.480]   They can't not say anything now and in the end, I think that will be beneficial for everybody.
[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:33.480]   And when you have the visibility that Apple has and when you have the clear margins that Apple has,
[00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:34.480]   you're going to invite these.
[00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:38.480]   If you're making so much money per every unit, why is it not?
[00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:43.480]   Well, it's interesting because the Wall Street Journal seems to have picked Google as its Betenor as its...
[00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:45.480]   And now the Times seems to pick Apple.
[00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:47.480]   And I don't know why. It just kind of looks that way.
[00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:50.480]   Here's the article, "Apple's Lead in Smartphones Not Guaranteed."
[00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:54.480]   Nothing is guaranteed in a lot of meaningless statement, of course.
[00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:57.480]   But I guess the point is at the moment Kevin J. O'Brien's app...
[00:43:57.480 --> 00:44:00.480]   I think it just switched enough in the fall.
[00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:01.480]   It goes back and forth.
[00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:05.480]   But the point really is that if you go to Barcelona and you go to Mobile World Congress,
[00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:12.480]   you're going to see a lot of very competitive, very powerful, very interesting phones from the 41 megapixel,
[00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:18.480]   Nokia phone, to the new HTC One, which is a very impressive Android phone.
[00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:19.480]   And Apple's not there, right?
[00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:20.480]   And Apple's not there.
[00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:24.480]   So that's the downside of Apple bypassing events like that,
[00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:28.480]   is that it makes that story all about everybody who's trying to fight Apple.
[00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:30.480]   Right. Of course they do release their...
[00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:32.480]   Apple's always there, but not there.
[00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:36.480]   They don't go to CES, but they do announcements during the...
[00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:39.480]   So Eric Schmidt takes the stage in Barcelona for Mobile World Congress,
[00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:43.480]   and within two minutes, Apple has sent out their press invitation for their event.
[00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:44.480]   At the same time.
[00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:45.480]   Do you think that was intentional?
[00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:47.480]   Oh, what are the chances that they...
[00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:48.480]   Because tomorrow...
[00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:49.480]   That was time...
[00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:52.480]   Well, I predicted and I was wrong, but I predicted Apple would do it tomorrow...
[00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:53.480]   Right.
[00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:57.480]   ...when Steve Ballmer takes the stage and to talk about Windows 8.
[00:44:57.480 --> 00:44:59.480]   So you can actually, if you want to read more...
[00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:00.480]   technology.
[00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:03.480]   ...and more criminology, we see who's more of a threat.
[00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:06.480]   Apple's much more worried about Google than they are about Microsoft.
[00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:08.480]   I'm sure you're trying to pay attention to Microsoft anymore.
[00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:11.480]   I don't think they care about anybody to be honest with you,
[00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:13.480]   and I think they just release it when they release it.
[00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:14.480]   I agree.
[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:20.480]   Tim Cook said that Apple sold 37 million iPhones, 17 million more than it ever sold in a quarter.
[00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:22.480]   That's in the fourth quarter.
[00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:26.480]   He said, "That's pretty good, but as I see a 37 million for the last quarter,
[00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:32.480]   "represented 24% of the smartphone market, so three out of four people bought something else."
[00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:35.480]   And basically saying, "We want them.
[00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:36.480]   We want them too."
[00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:40.480]   So look, one thing we can all agree on, competition is great.
[00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:42.480]   And Apple's getting some competition.
[00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:44.480]   That's fine, but Apple's not going to sit back on its laurels.
[00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:46.480]   They're going to compete.
[00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:49.480]   Did Samsung announce it's...
[00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:51.480]   Eileen, is it a Galaxy 3?
[00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:52.480]   No.
[00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:53.480]   No.
[00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:54.480]   That's rumored.
[00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:55.480]   It's rumored.
[00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:56.480]   Hey, hi, I asked.
[00:45:56.480 --> 00:45:58.480]   [laughter]
[00:45:58.480 --> 00:46:01.480]   I asked, "Next time we get a shot at Eileen, would you do me this?
[00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:04.480]   Would you look at the camera, act surprised and duck under the desk?"
[00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:05.480]   Not you, Eileen.
[00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:06.480]   We've got a...
[00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:07.480]   What do you mean, Eileen?
[00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:08.480]   We've got a...
[00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:09.480]   We've got a...
[00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:11.480]   We've got a stage this, you know, so next time.
[00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:12.480]   Okay, here we go.
[00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:13.480]   Here we go.
[00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:14.480]   Eileen, what about the Galaxy 3?
[00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:17.480]   Did Apple, did Samsung say anything about that?
[00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:19.480]   Well, no.
[00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:21.480]   [laughter]
[00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:22.480]   Well done.
[00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:24.480]   Well done, Sa.
[00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:25.480]   That's a...
[00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:26.480]   Stage.
[00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:27.480]   Our attempt to go viral.
[00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:28.480]   Totally fake.
[00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:29.480]   [laughter]
[00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:31.480]   Shh, don't say the word.
[00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:32.480]   S-word.
[00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:40.240]   So, the bottom line on this New York Times article is that Apple is not represented at Mobile
[00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:43.480]   World Congress, but is certainly going to put up a fight and is not giving up.
[00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:48.480]   Apple is focused on defending the high end of the market, but there is a low end and
[00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:51.480]   the low end may well be taken by somebody like Nokia.
[00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:54.480]   And that's why we see the 3GS still out there from Apple, so that they want to...
[00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:55.480]   Right.
[00:46:55.480 --> 00:46:56.480]   They want to in there too.
[00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:57.480]   But it's...
[00:46:57.480 --> 00:46:59.480]   I went last year to Mobile World Congress, Barcelona, Great Town.
[00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:00.480]   I'm really loving it.
[00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:03.480]   It's much harder to not go now that I've been there once.
[00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:04.480]   We made a mistake not going.
[00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:09.480]   Because it's so awesome, but you know, it's weird because Apple, like nobody wants to say
[00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:10.480]   the name.
[00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:11.480]   Right.
[00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:12.480]   It's like speak his name and he will appear.
[00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:16.480]   So they all are like, well unlike other products and everybody tries to not talk about Apple,
[00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:19.480]   but everything is really about a response to Apple.
[00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:20.480]   It's kind of amazing.
[00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:21.480]   Of course it is.
[00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:22.480]   It's weird.
[00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:23.480]   It was even like that at CES.
[00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:24.480]   Yeah.
[00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:25.480]   Yeah.
[00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:26.480]   It's like, Apple, it's great.
[00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:28.480]   They just cast a Paul over the entire tech industry.
[00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:29.480]   They're so dominant.
[00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:30.480]   Yeah.
[00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:32.480]   It's the coast floating over the boat.
[00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:34.480]   What will we do next?
[00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:35.480]   What do we call it?
[00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:37.480]   They who shall not be named?
[00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:38.480]   Yeah.
[00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:39.480]   Applemore.
[00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:40.480]   Applemore.
[00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:43.480]   Let's do it like it.
[00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:44.480]   I like it.
[00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:45.480]   New Five.
[00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:48.480]   Next year we are going to go to Mobile World Congress.
[00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:49.480]   We made a huge mistake.
[00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:54.480]   I was thinking about it and Eileen was lobbying for it and it turns out that this, because
[00:47:54.480 --> 00:48:01.840]   Mobile is now the fastest, hardest growing segment in technology, that's become like
[00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:03.480]   CES or it's the show.
[00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:06.040]   I think that is an excellent business decision, Leo.
[00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:09.000]   And by the way, as a sidebar, the beer is good.
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.280]   Manchego cheese, the best cheese ever.
[00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:12.280]   Manchego.
[00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:13.280]   And tapas.
[00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:14.280]   And paella.
[00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:17.080]   They have three different kinds of ham flavored Pringles.
[00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:18.080]   I swear to God.
[00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:19.080]   Come on.
[00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:20.080]   Come on.
[00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:21.080]   Yes.
[00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:23.720]   And you think it tastes like bacon, but they do them the bacon, but they have like the
[00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:24.720]   farm flavors.
[00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:29.040]   I would like to say that if you're looking for people, my wife spent a year in Barcelona
[00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:31.040]   and speaks fluent Spanish.
[00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:33.400]   So she, well, I think we'll send a team.
[00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:34.400]   I think we'll cover them like we do.
[00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:36.040]   Oh, no, it's a very serious business.
[00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:37.040]   Yes.
[00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:38.040]   Yes.
[00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:43.040]   Well, I love Barcelona too, but I think nevertheless, this is because it's very clear this year.
[00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:46.600]   Look at the announcements and frankly, you look at the CES.
[00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:50.760]   CES, they held back most of the phone companies at CES held back because they made their
[00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:51.760]   big announcements.
[00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:55.800]   The announcements in the desktop and laptop market and it's not, you know, well, they're
[00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:58.360]   going to be smaller, lighter.
[00:48:58.360 --> 00:49:00.480]   It's not, it's nothing much to say, right?
[00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:03.080]   But you look at tablets and phones, that's where everything's happening.
[00:49:03.080 --> 00:49:04.080]   Yeah.
[00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:08.300]   Also, I think 2013 is going to be really interesting because both Google and the hardware manufacturers
[00:49:08.300 --> 00:49:10.600]   are really going to have their act together to a degree.
[00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:13.440]   They did not have it together this year, the year before.
[00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:18.120]   You're also going to see Microsoft presenting in force with again, serious tablets that
[00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:19.560]   can really turn a few heads.
[00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:20.560]   Yep.
[00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:24.840]   And then, last year was kind of sad because everybody was so optimistic because it's
[00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:29.000]   like they spent, they had to, they had to watch Apple make all the money the first year of
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:33.080]   the iPad and then they're like, no, but look, we spent the last year building our wonderful,
[00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:36.280]   wonderful touchpad and our wonderful, wonderful playbook.
[00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:40.080]   And once we put our player on the field, oh boy, then you're going to see some real
[00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:44.960]   full contact football and then cut to this wrecked body just being pulled off on the
[00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:48.400]   stretcher off the field.
[00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:53.600]   And I am very, I like what's happening in the Android market.
[00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:55.920]   I'm very interested by this HTC One, this note.
[00:49:55.920 --> 00:50:01.480]   I think that there's some, what's happening is Apple is towing the line and in a very
[00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:03.600]   linear way improving.
[00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:05.800]   That's what they do.
[00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:06.800]   That's what they do.
[00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:08.560]   They're one company after all.
[00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:11.440]   Although you look at Samsung, which is also one company and they've got this size, this
[00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:15.840]   size, this size, this size, this size, this size, any size you want, you just pick one,
[00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:17.360]   they can't figure out what the problem is.
[00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:20.160]   They've claimed the top of the bell curve, right?
[00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:21.160]   Right.
[00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:22.160]   They've got sweet spots.
[00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:23.960]   And so Samsung's really smart to say we're going to spread it out.
[00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:26.640]   It's like playing a little bit on the, like, roulette table or something.
[00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:29.360]   Sorry, we're going to just play a lot of little bets and see what works.
[00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:32.800]   Well, I think that the other thing is that the personality of Apple users is they just
[00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:33.800]   want it to work.
[00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:38.040]   They don't want to, they don't want to have 18 different things to choose from.
[00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:40.720]   You know, they just want it to work.
[00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:41.720]   Yep.
[00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:44.160]   And I, you know, I have an Android phone that I like to play with as well.
[00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:46.840]   So, you know, so the thing is, is that I like some of the freedom that I get with that.
[00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:50.880]   And I like some of the extra pieces and it ties into Google Plus better and that type
[00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:51.880]   of thing.
[00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:53.440]   Regardless, it's very good to have competition.
[00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:54.440]   Yeah.
[00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:59.960]   I just think that Apple has to get some, maybe not, but I'd ask you guys, don't they get
[00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:04.040]   some input from what's going on out there and think about maybe different screen sizes
[00:51:04.040 --> 00:51:07.640]   or do you think Apple's just so insular that they just say, "Nope, we're going to put on
[00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:08.640]   blinkers.
[00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:09.640]   We're not going to look at that."
[00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:13.200]   I definitely pay attention to what everybody else is doing and then they slowly accumulate
[00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:15.200]   the things that they think are the best of the product.
[00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:18.840]   On iOS 5 is a very good example of taking the best of Android and saying, "We could
[00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:19.840]   do that."
[00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:20.840]   Apple's funny.
[00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:25.040]   I think that they do look at the competition, but they also have the separate driver, which
[00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:29.160]   is this internal driver of how can we make this better and do things that are different.
[00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:30.760]   And they do a little bit of both.
[00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:33.360]   But I do think they pay attention.
[00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:36.600]   Sometimes I think they, I mean, if the Galaxy Note became a huge hit, they'd be like, "All
[00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:38.200]   right, maybe we were wrong about that."
[00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:42.600]   But they've probably done that all that testing before and said, "Nah, no, it doesn't really
[00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:43.600]   work."
[00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:46.640]   I mean, other articles, you go to CES and there's tons of Apple employees.
[00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:47.640]   I recognize some of them.
[00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:48.640]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:50.640]   Oh, they're just wandering through CES, just looking at cool things.
[00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:51.640]   They do not want you to know they're there.
[00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:52.640]   Yeah.
[00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:54.680]   No, no, they're going to watch "Tend Around" and they have the badge, they'll turn around
[00:51:54.680 --> 00:51:55.680]   or blacked out.
[00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:59.400]   And, but there's some of them that I recognize and so I know that they're there and they're
[00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:01.000]   all wandered around just looking at cool stuff.
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:02.000]   They're thinking about what they can do now.
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:07.600]   It is part of the Apple mythos that it's all we think about.
[00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:12.040]   It's just the, we're thinking of the Aristotelian perfection.
[00:52:12.040 --> 00:52:13.200]   Yes, the ideal.
[00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:15.600]   So we don't care what others should do.
[00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:19.920]   But it does point out the strengths of the two phone companies.
[00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:23.720]   As phone companies, Apple's greatest product is the iPhone and all the thought and all
[00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:28.640]   the planning they put into each model they introduce where everything has been deeply
[00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:31.920]   and profoundly considered top to bottom inside and out.
[00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:37.080]   Whereas in the Android market, their biggest advantage is every other phone that's out
[00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:38.080]   there.
[00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:44.120]   If there are people who are ridiculing the note, it's, there would be properly ridiculing
[00:52:44.120 --> 00:52:46.240]   it if that was the only phone that was out there.
[00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:50.600]   But it's an indication that no matter what kind of phone you want, if you want an Android,
[00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:54.000]   you can probably find exactly the kind that you want.
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:53:00.000]   If you want one with a built-in pico projector, Samsung makes a model of iPhone that has that
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:01.480]   Android phone that has a built-in.
[00:53:01.480 --> 00:53:02.480]   Is that wild?
[00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:03.480]   Yeah.
[00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:04.480]   Yeah.
[00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:08.080]   There's more of 41 megapixel camera from Nokia, which is running on SIM.
[00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:13.440]   I mean, the funny, the funny, the funny, the funny running gag from last year's Mobile
[00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:17.200]   World Congress for me was, "Why are you putting 3D cameras in a phone?"
[00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:21.240]   I mean, it's other than to spread pink eye amongst all the tech journalists who are
[00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:24.600]   demonstrating on those glasses and looking at the results.
[00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:26.640]   I mean, but it's not just GEMICRI.
[00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:30.560]   There are people who just want to slide out keyboard or they just want this one feature
[00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:34.640]   that Apple has no interest in or there's not so much they need to rent a display, but
[00:53:34.640 --> 00:53:39.680]   they do need something that's larger because they can't really operate what was used to
[00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:43.440]   be a standard-sized phone two years ago and is now kind of small.
[00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:44.440]   Right.
[00:53:44.440 --> 00:53:48.040]   People don't get emotionally invested in the operating system quite so much, I think,
[00:53:48.040 --> 00:53:52.040]   with phones as they do when you have an iPad or a desktop.
[00:53:52.040 --> 00:53:56.120]   They do get, I think, invested in the form factor, though.
[00:53:56.120 --> 00:54:00.520]   And I think that really the most, a phone is the most personal computer, right?
[00:54:00.520 --> 00:54:02.640]   I was in your pocket, it's really personal.
[00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:04.600]   So I like the idea that you have choices.
[00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:06.520]   I think that's because it's so personal.
[00:54:06.520 --> 00:54:12.520]   And I think you do get, I know I am heavily invested in the form factor of my phone.
[00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:17.160]   But I mean, I think they see it more as a practical and functional item.
[00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:18.160]   Oh, yes.
[00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:19.160]   That's much more difficult than that.
[00:54:19.160 --> 00:54:20.160]   It's not a toy.
[00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:24.560]   It's much more difficult for them to think, "Oh, well, I'm buying into a wonderful ecosystem
[00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:28.440]   in which there's managed content in which there's a cloud-based plan."
[00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:31.000]   It's like, "No, does this have a slide-out keyboard?"
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:32.000]   Nope, next.
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:33.520]   It's very practical.
[00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:34.520]   It's very practical.
[00:54:34.520 --> 00:54:38.720]   If your phone crashes in a phone call, you know, that's it.
[00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:40.080]   You're dead to me.
[00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:41.920]   So it becomes very practical, absolutely.
[00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:43.080]   I think that that's the case.
[00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:44.080]   What about Apple TV?
[00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:46.000]   Where would Apple announce such a thing?
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:47.000]   Would they do that?
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:48.160]   They're not going to do that March 7th, clearly.
[00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:52.600]   The way that invitation is structured, it's clear that that, you know, I thought maybe
[00:54:52.600 --> 00:54:56.640]   we'd see some other product announcements, but no, that's not going to happen, right?
[00:54:56.640 --> 00:54:57.640]   Yeah.
[00:54:57.640 --> 00:55:04.080]   For the guy who was nitpicking about the nitpickers, if I had seen a movie app in that application
[00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:09.160]   doc, I would be thinking about, "Okay, we're going to see a 1080 Apple TV," or we might
[00:55:09.160 --> 00:55:14.200]   even see something that is more video specifically oriented about the announcement.
[00:55:14.200 --> 00:55:17.760]   So now I really don't know what else might be introduced outside of the iPad because
[00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:19.520]   there's not even a nod to anything else.
[00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:20.520]   Nope.
[00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:22.320]   I'm going to share the stage with two.
[00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:25.680]   You've got two great products, a brand new one that's going to change everything, and
[00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:28.000]   then a new iPad, which is the super hot product.
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:30.320]   Why would you have them all be on one day?
[00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:34.720]   Well, if the product that you're selling is HD and you're saying that we have the,
[00:55:34.720 --> 00:55:40.800]   starting today, we have the greatest and largest and deepest library of HD content that's
[00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:43.320]   purchasable and rentable on the internet.
[00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:48.320]   And we have the greatest mobile device for watching digital HD content and the greatest
[00:55:48.320 --> 00:55:51.000]   living room device for doing HD content.
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:52.880]   So it's not out of the question.
[00:55:52.880 --> 00:55:57.680]   It's possible, I think more likely that it's a third generation in Apple TV, maybe than
[00:55:57.680 --> 00:55:59.880]   the groundbreaking Apple TV set.
[00:55:59.880 --> 00:56:00.880]   I agree.
[00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:01.880]   I could see that perhaps.
[00:56:01.880 --> 00:56:06.000]   I'd be shocked if there were an Apple TV set.
[00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:11.720]   I would have expected there to be some sort of a nod to something else other than the
[00:56:11.720 --> 00:56:15.000]   iPad in the, because they love being cute like that.
[00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:20.280]   They're the masters of retroactively, we go back to the invitation saying, Oh, something
[00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:22.920]   to see and something to touch.
[00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:26.760]   They're taking things from the iPad and putting them into the Mac.
[00:56:26.760 --> 00:56:28.000]   It wasn't just turning our toe.
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:29.000]   Okay.
[00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:30.000]   I get it now.
[00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:32.360]   My understanding, I'm not sure if this is totally accurate, but my understanding talking
[00:56:32.360 --> 00:56:35.480]   to someone about it is the two times that you release a TV is the end of August and the
[00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:36.480]   end of October.
[00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:39.000]   One is for football and the other one is for Christmas.
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:41.600]   That's when a vast majority of the purchases happen.
[00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:46.400]   So there's not really any reason to release a new TV in the, in this period of time.
[00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:50.440]   Actually, though, and with the fact that the Apple TV too seems to be drying up and the
[00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:54.960]   fact that this is going to be a 1080 capable iPad, that having upgrading all the videos
[00:56:54.960 --> 00:56:59.400]   on iTunes or as many as possible to 1080, that's probably part of the two.
[00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:00.400]   Yeah.
[00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:01.400]   Yeah, I can see that.
[00:57:01.400 --> 00:57:02.400]   And that would just be a side announcement.
[00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:03.400]   Yeah.
[00:57:03.400 --> 00:57:05.400]   As a result, everything is actually, let's just let's show you how great this looks.
[00:57:05.400 --> 00:57:06.400]   Right.
[00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:07.400]   You know, well, and that's what you need.
[00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:09.840]   You need apps and content that take advantage of a retina display.
[00:57:09.840 --> 00:57:13.640]   Well, I'm going to make a prediction that we're going to get that little lecture about
[00:57:13.640 --> 00:57:17.160]   how when you, you know, 720 to 1080 doesn't seem that big.
[00:57:17.160 --> 00:57:21.720]   But when you count the pixels, it's actually, and the whole like Y 1080 is important, which
[00:57:21.720 --> 00:57:22.720]   it's never been up to now.
[00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:23.720]   It's just an easy experience.
[00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:26.240]   But as soon as Apple gets 1080, it's going to be like, oh, but 1080 is huge.
[00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:27.240]   Yep.
[00:57:27.240 --> 00:57:31.040]   And the fact that it'll be almost impossible to distinguish a 720p from a 1080p stream
[00:57:31.040 --> 00:57:33.960]   on your iPad, just the size of it, it'll be almost impossible.
[00:57:33.960 --> 00:57:34.960]   Yeah, it's just small.
[00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:35.960]   Yeah.
[00:57:35.960 --> 00:57:39.040]   And we will see somebody from electronic arts demonstrating a retina display game of some
[00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:42.120]   kind of course Madden in HD or something.
[00:57:42.120 --> 00:57:43.640]   Let's keep the segments short.
[00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:44.640]   Yeah.
[00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:46.880]   They're always like they always go to Tim Cook, right?
[00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:49.680]   Tim Cook with a little visit from Scott Forest, all's.
[00:57:49.680 --> 00:57:50.680]   No, Phil Schiller.
[00:57:50.680 --> 00:57:51.920]   I think it's more Phil Schiller.
[00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:52.920]   Schiller.
[00:57:52.920 --> 00:57:55.480]   For Scott's desktop, maybe Tim comes on in the beginning and does a little.
[00:57:55.480 --> 00:57:56.480]   Eddie Q.
[00:57:56.480 --> 00:57:59.280]   Maybe a little Eddie Q action for the iTunes stuff.
[00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:00.280]   It's possible.
[00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:01.280]   Yeah.
[00:58:01.280 --> 00:58:02.280]   Yeah.
[00:58:02.280 --> 00:58:03.920]   I just my only request for Apple is the third party ones just keep me short because they're
[00:58:03.920 --> 00:58:05.240]   not they're always too long and slow.
[00:58:05.240 --> 00:58:07.280]   I wish Johnny I would do.
[00:58:07.280 --> 00:58:08.280]   Yeah, he'd be fun.
[00:58:08.280 --> 00:58:09.280]   He'd be good.
[00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:10.280]   He'd be good.
[00:58:10.280 --> 00:58:11.280]   He'd be good.
[00:58:11.280 --> 00:58:12.280]   He'd be good.
[00:58:12.280 --> 00:58:13.280]   He'd be good.
[00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:14.280]   He'd be good.
[00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:15.280]   He'd be good.
[00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:16.280]   He'd be good.
[00:58:16.280 --> 00:58:17.280]   He'd be good.
[00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:18.280]   He'd be good.
[00:58:18.280 --> 00:58:19.280]   Yeah.
[00:58:19.280 --> 00:58:20.280]   He'd be good.
[00:58:20.280 --> 00:58:21.280]   I mean, he'd be good.
[00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:22.280]   He'd be good.
[00:58:22.280 --> 00:58:23.280]   I mean, videos.
[00:58:23.280 --> 00:58:24.280]   He'd just be in the videos.
[00:58:24.280 --> 00:58:25.280]   Yeah.
[00:58:25.280 --> 00:58:26.280]   It may be that he needs to be in the videos.
[00:58:26.280 --> 00:58:27.280]   I mean, we may not know.
[00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:28.280]   He may, he may lisp.
[00:58:28.280 --> 00:58:29.280]   He may not like the spotlight.
[00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:30.280]   He just seems like he'd be so good.
[00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:31.280]   Oh, well, also, I don't know if he's got an English accent after all.
[00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:32.280]   I mean, really, that's really all you need for a nice exhibition.
[00:58:32.280 --> 00:58:39.280]   I mean, I think that's the perfect place for the audience.
[00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:42.280]   I think that's the perfect place for the audience.
[00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:47.280]   I think that's the perfect place for the audience.
[00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:52.280]   I think that's the perfect place for the audience.
[00:58:52.280 --> 00:58:53.280]   Maybe that's what I'm announcing.
[00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:55.280]   People are like, "Why would Apple share the stage?"
[00:58:55.280 --> 00:58:59.280]   It's like Microsoft coming on as a subplot in Apple's big announcement.
[00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:00.280]   Wouldn't that be interesting?
[00:59:00.280 --> 00:59:04.280]   I think Apple is happy because although that's good for Microsoft, it's great for Apple, too,
[00:59:04.280 --> 00:59:06.280]   to say, and even Microsoft offices on iPad.
[00:59:06.280 --> 00:59:07.280]   Well, I don't see.
[00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:11.280]   I've been thinking about that ever since this, ever since Office for the iPad,
[00:59:11.280 --> 00:59:13.280]   it became a touch more real over the past couple of weeks.
[00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:18.280]   That obviously it's in Microsoft's hugest best interest to make sure that there is a
[00:59:18.280 --> 00:59:20.280]   mobile enabled version of Office.
[00:59:20.280 --> 00:59:24.280]   And that'd be one of the greatest Office apps you can buy for any mobile device.
[00:59:24.280 --> 00:59:29.280]   So what happens if they decide to make this an opportunity to solidify Office across
[00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:31.280]   all boards, across all devices?
[00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:37.280]   What would happen to the Android tablet marketplace if there was a perfect for mobile,
[00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:41.280]   but still within that context, a perfect Office suite made by Microsoft.
[00:59:41.280 --> 00:59:46.280]   That was 100% file compatible that would run on every single Android tablet out there.
[00:59:46.280 --> 00:59:52.280]   Suddenly a huge factor, a huge feature that people want a mobile computing for,
[00:59:52.280 --> 00:59:55.280]   that they want for a small computer that they travel with, that's been solved.
[00:59:55.280 --> 01:00:00.280]   And now there won't be an inherent advantage to getting an iPad for that specific job.
[01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:04.280]   So that could be more disruptive than maybe we're guessing.
[01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:09.280]   That might be an argument for saying Apple will co-opt Microsoft, bring them on stage,
[01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:12.280]   say, look, if don't do anything for an Android and we'll give you a little bit of pride
[01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:13.280]   of place.
[01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:19.280]   Like a reversal of what happened like a '97 where we have like Tim Cok will be like
[01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:20.280]   a big giant head.
[01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:28.280]   We've invested $150 million in Microsoft with their agreement that we would be exclusive
[01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:29.280]   to mobile for Office.
[01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:31.280]   Boy has a worm turn.
[01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:33.280]   Across lessons and patents.
[01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:35.280]   No, why not?
[01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:38.280]   If you're Microsoft, why wouldn't you, for tablet Office?
[01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:41.280]   iPad would be first and Windows 8 would be second, right?
[01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:42.280]   What cares about Android?
[01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:45.280]   Android tablets are not that relevant, especially for Microsoft.
[01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:46.280]   Yeah.
[01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:47.280]   I agree with you, Andy.
[01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:52.080]   It could be a game changer, but I think if Apple makes it at all, it's interesting for
[01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:53.080]   Microsoft to turn out.
[01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:54.080]   Are you guys still using it?
[01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:55.080]   They're back on it.
[01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:56.080]   It would screw over a lot of people.
[01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:59.160]   Does anyone here use Office?
[01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:00.160]   Lots of people do.
[01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:01.320]   I mean, I'm working on the web.
[01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:02.320]   It's less relevant now.
[01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:06.000]   And so I do my writing and other text editors, but I still have them and Excel.
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:09.840]   I still use some because there's some stuff that Excel is sort of best at even though
[01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:11.040]   the charts aren't as pretty as numbers.
[01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:12.040]   You know, so weird.
[01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:13.040]   I was also thinking about the other day.
[01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:15.040]   I work hasn't been updated since 2009.
[01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:16.040]   No.
[01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:17.040]   Yes.
[01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:18.040]   We saw.
[01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:24.640]   I work on the Mac hasn't been updated, but the Mountain Lion demo included an updated
[01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:26.480]   version of pages that does document in the cloud.
[01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:30.360]   So there is an update coming, whether they call it 12 or whether it's just an update
[01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:31.360]   to 09.
[01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:33.560]   I would imagine it'll see 12, but that was I saw.
[01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:34.560]   It's real.
[01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:37.280]   Wasn't there also a marginal update that added ePub support?
[01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:38.280]   I think I think that was.
[01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:39.280]   Yeah.
[01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:40.280]   It was incremental.
[01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:41.280]   It's still Office.
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:42.280]   It's still Office.
[01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:44.120]   So not I work on it.
[01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:48.640]   The advantage of Microsoft Office, like real native Microsoft Office supporters, that there
[01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:55.360]   is as yet no solution apart from doing VNC that will allow you to retain notes and revision
[01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:59.800]   changes and collaborative features on a document.
[01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:04.680]   I was talking to somebody who of course was had a product that allows you to do 100%
[01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:07.280]   native Word files on an iPad.
[01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:12.120]   It was exciting as an example, somebody who was talking to you earlier who two lawyers
[01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:14.040]   are going about, oh, look, you're supposed to.
[01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:17.600]   This version of the contract doesn't reflect this, doesn't reflect that.
[01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:21.960]   And then after the 10 minutes of the call says, oh, are you reading this document on
[01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:22.960]   an iPad?
[01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:23.960]   Yeah.
[01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:26.520]   You see, if you had this on Windows, you would see that those three paragraphs had already
[01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:27.520]   been cut out.
[01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:31.120]   We've been arguing for 20 minutes on nothing, which is a self-serving story to tell, but
[01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:35.120]   it is illustrative that there are so many situations which you do need the real version
[01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:36.120]   of Office.
[01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:37.120]   Right.
[01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:38.120]   Right.
[01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:40.480]   And I mean, that's the point here is that they can also tie it in with SkyDrive.
[01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:42.000]   They can tie it in with all the Microsoft stuff.
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:46.560]   So if you're a company that's relying on Office and you have iPads now, you know, now it makes
[01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:47.560]   sense they can work together.
[01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:48.560]   Thank you for for us.
[01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:54.160]   I think for us it's a financial decision pages and keen.
[01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:55.160]   We don't get this.
[01:02:55.160 --> 01:02:56.160]   This is much.
[01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:59.800]   So now you by the way, instead of I bought I work, you know, on the bundle and I still
[01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:01.720]   don't get credit for having it.
[01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:04.120]   So I have to buy 20 bucks per.
[01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:06.680]   So I did actually buy the $20 keynote in the app store.
[01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:07.680]   But look at pages.
[01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:08.680]   Oh, nine.
[01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:09.680]   Yeah.
[01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:14.080]   They've added version 4.1 so they've added lion support, but it's 0.9.
[01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:17.520]   Yeah, they haven't done the big step and that's a question.
[01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:18.520]   Yeah.
[01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:24.200]   I guess my question, well, I mean, most of what I write is in, is in Keena or text edit.
[01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:27.840]   So it's, you know, that the, but I'm.
[01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:32.400]   Office is no longer essential for super gigantic tech nerds, but there are lots of like, lots
[01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:33.400]   of offices.
[01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:34.400]   Lots of offices.
[01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:35.400]   There are lots of people out there.
[01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:36.400]   I'm not saying there isn't.
[01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:39.400]   I'm just saying that like I look at a lot of little smaller companies like us and I'm
[01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:40.720]   just not willing to pay for it anymore.
[01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:41.720]   You know, that's a big thing.
[01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:42.720]   It's office.
[01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:44.560]   I look at the price of office and I just go, I'm not going to pay for that anymore.
[01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:46.040]   Although it's much cheaper than it used to be.
[01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:47.040]   Yeah, I just hate Excel.
[01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:48.800]   I think that's the biggest thing.
[01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:49.800]   Passion.
[01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:54.720]   Our business office, our business office, it's why we'll use nothing less.
[01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:58.200]   The scale here, if you want to scale, then Excel makes a lot of sense.
[01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:02.560]   So if you need to do big financials, but a lot of people use Excel to organize their,
[01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:04.200]   their projects and that is crazy.
[01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:05.200]   Terrible.
[01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:06.200]   I'm just telling you.
[01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:10.640]   But when it comes to organizing your project and organizing even small budgets, numbers
[01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:13.280]   is just amazing to do that.
[01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:14.280]   You know, let's take a break.
[01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:17.280]   We're going to talk more about, we got to get some Mac news in here.
[01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:18.440]   Yeah, mountain lion.
[01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:19.440]   Mountain lion.
[01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:20.440]   Okay, good.
[01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:22.160]   That's not really mountain lion.
[01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:23.160]   It's mountain kitty.
[01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:25.000]   That's a mountain lion.
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.840]   Actually, you know, mountain lions aren't that big.
[01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:30.440]   They're kind of like little, they're like little like in between lions and kitties.
[01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:32.400]   They're still pretty big.
[01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:33.400]   They're vicious though.
[01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:34.400]   They're big.
[01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:35.400]   They're largest small cat, but they're big.
[01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:37.000]   They're the largest small cat.
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:38.080]   They're related to the house cat.
[01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:39.080]   And feisty.
[01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:40.080]   But they're really big.
[01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:41.080]   We have them.
[01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:42.080]   If you want to visit, we have them up in the hills.
[01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:43.080]   They'll eat you.
[01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:44.080]   Oh, yeah.
[01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:45.080]   Yes.
[01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:46.080]   Yeah.
[01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:47.080]   Watch out.
[01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:48.080]   I saw that.
[01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:50.760]   I saw that the my wife used to make fun of me because when we go into the, if we go into
[01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:54.760]   a national, like one of the national parks around here, I won't go in without a knife.
[01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:55.760]   I mean, I grew up in the country.
[01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:56.760]   We have a lot of mountain lions.
[01:04:56.760 --> 01:04:59.560]   And they had, they showed that they were the kid got attacked and his father pulled
[01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:01.720]   out a knife and stabbed the mountain lion.
[01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:03.640]   I looked at my wife, I was like, see, that's why.
[01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:04.640]   Or a noise maker.
[01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:07.240]   Just a noise maker, something to scare them away.
[01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:10.800]   Just, you know, I prefer a six inch or larger blade.
[01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:11.920]   I don't think I want to get that close.
[01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:14.560]   I want to, I would like them to refer, I prefer not to get that close.
[01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:19.880]   I go, Hey, hi, Matt, you know, it's even better.
[01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:21.320]   You can lay later gone.
[01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:22.320]   No, a dinner gone.
[01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:24.200]   I'm going to say, oh, exactly.
[01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:25.360]   That draws them.
[01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:26.360]   They're scared.
[01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:27.720]   They're scared by the smell of steak sauce too.
[01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:33.480]   So use that as an exfoliant and stay 20 yards ahead of me at all times.
[01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:34.480]   That's a big mountain line.
[01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:35.480]   That's a big ones like that.
[01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:36.480]   Yeah.
[01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:37.480]   That's a really big one.
[01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:38.480]   See, that's what they are.
[01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:39.480]   That's what they are.
[01:05:39.480 --> 01:05:40.480]   You're thinking of like a bobcat or something.
[01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:41.480]   The mountain lions are big.
[01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:43.320]   Oh, I had no idea.
[01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:44.320]   Yeah.
[01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:46.440]   I thought there were like little one little thing.
[01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:48.000]   No, I think you're thinking like Bobcats.
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.640]   I must be thinking of Bobcats.
[01:05:49.640 --> 01:05:50.640]   No, they're big.
[01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:51.640]   They will eat you.
[01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:54.240]   Well, I know there was this that have that problem here.
[01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:58.240]   They were largely extinct by Western Pennsylvania, but everything, the knitling lions, the pit
[01:05:58.240 --> 01:06:02.520]   panthers, and old guys that would tell you that when they took the meat into market,
[01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:05.640]   they had to do it during the day because in the evening, the mountain lions would jump
[01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:08.080]   down and start eating.
[01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:10.880]   Google search is good if you want to find mountain lion pictures apparently.
[01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:11.880]   That's a nice one.
[01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:12.880]   He looks like it.
[01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:13.880]   That's a pretty kidding.
[01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:14.880]   Cooger is a mountain lion.
[01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:15.880]   Yeah.
[01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:18.040]   They should have used that instead of the mountain lion is not amused.
[01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:19.040]   Yeah.
[01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:20.040]   The picture that happened to you says.
[01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:21.040]   I really didn't like that one.
[01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:22.040]   It's kind of a pissed off mountain lion.
[01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:24.280]   Yeah, it looks like I'm going to eat that would have been better.
[01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:25.760]   See, there we go.
[01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:27.040]   Noodle kitty mountain lion.
[01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:31.800]   That's that's a if you raised a mountain lion from from pups.
[01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:33.680]   But they then be nice cat in the house.
[01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:34.680]   Okay, just checking.
[01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:38.440]   My cat, my cat has tried to kill me numerous times, but he's so small that he's fat.
[01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:41.320]   Cats being nice is just relative size to you.
[01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:44.640]   You know, as they as they as they as they increase, they're none of them are nice.
[01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:47.920]   It's just that as they increase in the relative size, they become more fun.
[01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:49.280]   Once they're big enough to eat you, they will.
[01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:52.640]   They just like, you know, I can I'm tired of, you know, break your neck.
[01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:56.280]   I kind of sense that actually from all even the little kitties, little cats are like,
[01:06:56.280 --> 01:06:57.280]   I would kill you, but you're too.
[01:06:57.280 --> 01:06:58.280]   They're too.
[01:06:58.280 --> 01:06:59.280]   They're too.
[01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:00.280]   They're too.
[01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:03.080]   Okay, whole steam being stocked by mountain lion.
[01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:05.440]   A whole steam being talked by a mountain lion.
[01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:06.440]   That's scary.
[01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:07.440]   Yes, this is.
[01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:11.360]   You just do that in iPad Photoshop.
[01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:15.840]   No, no, no, no, there's like there's an end in Colorado that serves.
[01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:19.920]   They specialize in serving the last two breeding pair of every living creature on earth and
[01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:21.400]   they have a they have a life.
[01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:25.760]   They have a stuffed mountain lion like in the lobby and you've do that.
[01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:26.920]   You know, where it looks.
[01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:30.440]   It looks like she's she's she's stopped and posed as though she's been well fed and is
[01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:32.600]   just interested in moving from that branch.
[01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:34.800]   But there you can't as you're getting your coat and your hat.
[01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:36.160]   Yeah, we're absolutely going on.
[01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:37.160]   Realize that.
[01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:40.800]   Okay, she would have like my entire throat between two of those claws.
[01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:44.640]   I would be looking at it almost unaware that she has just ended my life with it.
[01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:45.640]   Okay.
[01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:48.120]   By the way, this creature in the future, this is why we've never been able to do this
[01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:49.600]   show in under two hours.
[01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:53.600]   Just I'm pointing out now.
[01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:57.400]   Someday the Twit Network will be so massive and so powerful they can afford to say, how
[01:07:57.400 --> 01:08:01.280]   about we edit out the 58 minutes of stuff that have nothing to do with technology.
[01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:03.520]   Because people would get mad at us if we did that.
[01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:08.520]   Hey, this show brought to you by Ford, those great folks at Ford who make the amazing 21st
[01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:09.520]   century vehicles.
[01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:12.720]   We've come to love like my 2010 Mustang.
[01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:15.280]   Now the Mustang, of course, is a muscle car.
[01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:18.520]   It's got a big V8 engine and you know, it really.
[01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:21.840]   I get like, I think 18 miles to the gallon.
[01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:25.440]   And I should have now in hindsight as gas prices go up, perhaps consider it something
[01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:28.640]   like the Taurus SHO with its EcoBoost engine.
[01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:34.040]   See, Ford, they're thinking ahead, they understand the emissions controls, fuel prices.
[01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:39.000]   They've got to make cars that give you that feeling, that power, that torque, but also
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.680]   are very economical.
[01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:42.080]   And that's where the EcoBoost comes in.
[01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:43.080]   Really an amazing technology.
[01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:46.960]   You can find out more about it if you go to Ford.com/technology.
[01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:49.840]   Of course, they reduce the number of cylinders.
[01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:54.080]   They've got six cylinder EcoBoost in the SHO.
[01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:59.920]   Another doing four cylinder engines, two liters and 1.6 liter EcoBoost engines that compensate
[01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:04.120]   for the loss in horsepower and torque with a smaller engine through a combination of
[01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:06.840]   technologies including direct injection and turbo charging.
[01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:09.360]   Now I know you guys know cars, so I read these.
[01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:13.640]   I don't know what I'm talking about, but you correct me if I say something wrong here.
[01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:17.120]   The direct injection, it says here, produces a...
[01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:18.400]   What do you laugh at?
[01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:20.400]   I don't know anything about cars.
[01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:21.400]   I don't know anything about cars.
[01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:23.280]   I thought you guys, you see so manly.
[01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:24.920]   I've driven a car.
[01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:25.920]   You guys see manly.
[01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:27.160]   I drive a car.
[01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:29.400]   I drive a 1994 Honda Civic.
[01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:30.400]   No, we got to work on you.
[01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:31.400]   For me to say, we got to work on you.
[01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:33.640]   I know nothing about modern cars.
[01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:35.240]   I have plenty of experience with cars.
[01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:39.200]   I know that the railing of the staircase is the best place to put the orange truck.
[01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:43.400]   You want to get the car through the loop all the way across out to the other corner.
[01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:45.720]   So you probably don't have an EcoBoost in that hot wheel.
[01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:48.760]   I should have my own show on the Twitter network about cars.
[01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:51.640]   I found that Heartbeat City was the best car in all times.
[01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:52.640]   Here's the deal.
[01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:57.680]   Direct injection produces a cooler, denser charge that generates more power per drop of
[01:09:57.680 --> 01:10:03.760]   fuel and then the two small engine-cool turbo chargers spool up more quickly than a single
[01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:05.760]   large turbo turbo.
[01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:06.760]   A large tuber.
[01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:08.760]   Are you saying this is a turbocharger?
[01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:09.760]   Is the potato driven car?
[01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:11.720]   This is what has been explained to me.
[01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:14.960]   The idea of the turbocharger is that, of course, using energy from the exhaust, which
[01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:20.360]   is otherwise wasted, to spin those turbine wheels, they compress the incoming air, which
[01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:23.840]   increases the output for a liter of displacement.
[01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:27.680]   So you get a more powerful engine without the turbocharger length, because instead of
[01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:31.400]   using a big wheel, which stands to reason spins up more slowly, they use two smaller
[01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:32.400]   turbines.
[01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:41.400]   It really is an example of how Ford's really thinking about engines to make the best possible
[01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:43.040]   vehicle for your needs.
[01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:47.240]   Of course, they've got all electric, they've got hybrid electric, they've got plug-in hybrid.
[01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:49.960]   They're really doing some amazing stuff.
[01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:51.920]   Here it's all about ball bearings.
[01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:53.560]   I don't know.
[01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:55.720]   That's related to the process.
[01:10:55.720 --> 01:10:56.720]   No idea.
[01:10:56.720 --> 01:10:59.440]   But better ball bearings through chemistry.
[01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:04.920]   My suggestion is that you not listen to me, but you go to Ford.com/technology and actually
[01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:08.200]   read something accurate and useful.
[01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:13.440]   Or, you know, the proof is in the pudding, go test drive, the 2012 Explorer and Edge,
[01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:17.960]   which have the leading best-in-class highway fuel economy for the category.
[01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:22.520]   The Explorer has 28 highway miles per gallon according to the EPA with its 2.0 liter EcoBoost
[01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:25.520]   engine, and that is best-in-class and large utilities.
[01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:27.520]   28 highway miles per gallon.
[01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:28.520]   Your Frederick has an edge.
[01:11:28.520 --> 01:11:29.520]   A big car.
[01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:30.520]   I am so jealous.
[01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:31.520]   He loves it.
[01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:32.520]   He loves it.
[01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:34.000]   That's the high-tech one, boy.
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:35.000]   That's an amazing one.
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:36.000]   He got it loaded.
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.400]   Like, he gets near it in the back hatch.
[01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:40.800]   Yeah, what wakes up and says, "Hello.
[01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:41.800]   Come on, you know.
[01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:44.200]   It's a 2013 escape coming in the...
[01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:49.040]   I think a month will offer both 1.6 and 2.0 liter EcoBoost engines.
[01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:51.360]   So drive one of those at a Ford dealer near you.
[01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:54.080]   You will see what we're talking about.
[01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:57.680]   ♪ Moving along, singing a song ♪
[01:11:57.680 --> 01:12:01.200]   ♪ Apple explains iCloud in a new video ♪
[01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:04.080]   ♪ It's not easy to explain the cloud ♪
[01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:05.680]   Turns out they didn't even try to explain it.
[01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:06.680]   They just showed you.
[01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:07.680]   Yeah.
[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:08.680]   Yeah.
[01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:10.560]   This is a classic show over tell.
[01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:11.560]   Show over tell.
[01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:12.560]   Like, you know, they say show over show.
[01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:13.560]   Show over show.
[01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:14.560]   Show don't tell.
[01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:17.840]   Let me see if I can not pull this up here from the YouTube.
[01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:20.560]   That kind of sounds though.
[01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:23.840]   They made a mistake in trying to make it into its own...
[01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:27.560]   Promoted as though it's own product and its own sort of service.
[01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:30.920]   As opposed to simply over the next two years when they say, "Oh, we have this new thing
[01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:32.480]   called "Drock" was in the cloud.
[01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:34.080]   But I was powered by iCloud.
[01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:35.120]   "Oh, we have this new thing.
[01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:36.680]   It's called iTunes Everywhere.
[01:12:36.680 --> 01:12:37.680]   Oh, it's powered by iCloud."
[01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:38.680]   Yeah.
[01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:40.160]   Show me the things I'm doing with it.
[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:44.000]   In fact, I don't think anybody looking at this is going to have any idea what the hell
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:45.000]   they're...
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:46.000]   Why is...
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:47.000]   What is this?
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:48.000]   Stuff's coming in.
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.600]   Nobody is ever going to use iCloud.
[01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:53.520]   They're going to use the features that iCloud powers.
[01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:57.600]   So that's why I think it was sort of a mistake to put that so front and center.
[01:12:57.600 --> 01:12:58.600]   Yeah.
[01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:00.920]   They're kind of walking it back now, I think, a little bit and saying it's really about
[01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:03.280]   what it does and not about...
[01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:04.280]   It's not a thing.
[01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:05.640]   It's just part of everything else.
[01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:09.680]   Maybe to this point, Apple acquired Chomp, which was a great app recommendation engine
[01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:11.160]   on the iOS platform.
[01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:14.640]   And now they got the Chompers working for them.
[01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:17.880]   It's so hard to find apps that I mean, this is obviously a big issue.
[01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:18.880]   Did you use Chomp?
[01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:19.880]   Was that a...
[01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:20.880]   I hadn't used it.
[01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:25.040]   I installed it and I just...
[01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:28.520]   Neither the genius or Chomp did much for me.
[01:13:28.520 --> 01:13:32.560]   What you want is the idea is it looks at everything you've got and then, "Oh, this is what you're
[01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:33.560]   would like."
[01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:36.600]   So the big difference now is when Apple buys companies like this, they often do it because
[01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:39.360]   there's some underlying technology and they're also some really talented people.
[01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:40.360]   I think they got the people.
[01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:41.520]   And like with Lala, right?
[01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:45.280]   They didn't bring Lala inside, but they took the people and the knowledge.
[01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:51.200]   And the difference between Chomp and what they can do inside Apple is that inside Apple
[01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:52.360]   they have all the data, right?
[01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:55.120]   They have everything that Apple knows about it.
[01:13:55.120 --> 01:13:58.000]   And on the outside, they have to guess and they have to look at iTunes and they have
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.200]   to ask their customers to share data.
[01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:03.600]   On the inside, they'll have all that genius data about apps.
[01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:08.360]   They'll have all the app buying, purchase information that Apple stores.
[01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:09.920]   And so the data will be much richer.
[01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:11.960]   Plus, they'll have these smart people who thought about this.
[01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:14.960]   So for me, the good news is Apple is saying, "Yes, we need to upgrade our app recommendations."
[01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:15.960]   We understand the problem.
[01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:18.080]   Yeah, we understand the problem.
[01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:20.080]   95 Maxes is going to be...
[01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:23.840]   Maybe Mackerel also that there's an iTunes revamp in the works.
[01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:25.480]   An App Store overhaul.
[01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:29.440]   The new design is said to be even simpler and more user friendly than the current design.
[01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:33.600]   Apple is working on ways to enhance and speed the efficiency of finding new content like
[01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:36.200]   songs, videos and applications.
[01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:39.800]   Interactivity is a cornerstone in the new iTunes Store.
[01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:42.160]   iTunes does feel a little bit old, doesn't it?
[01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:43.160]   It's a little painful.
[01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:45.600]   Well, the app is painful, but it's a long time ago.
[01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:47.080]   It was painful a long time ago.
[01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:50.040]   The iTunes Store experience is also pretty long in the tooth.
[01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:51.040]   Yeah.
[01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:52.040]   Yeah.
[01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:56.200]   There's not any little gaps where you want to do something very simple when you're recommending
[01:14:56.200 --> 01:15:00.040]   an app to somebody, but then you realize that, "Oh, I can't check the price of this because
[01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:01.040]   of the situation.
[01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:04.840]   The situation I'm in in this particular pain of the app."
[01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:08.840]   Or you want to save something for later, it's not obvious that you have sort of a wish
[01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:09.840]   list.
[01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:11.640]   You have to really reveal it through a pop-up.
[01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:12.640]   Yeah.
[01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:17.640]   Apple and EMI announced Wednesday that you can buy Beatles ringtones for a mere Buck-99.
[01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:18.640]   Buck-29?
[01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:19.640]   29.
[01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:20.640]   29.
[01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:21.640]   Are you running out to get one?
[01:15:21.640 --> 01:15:22.640]   No.
[01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:23.640]   Ringtones.
[01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:24.640]   Ringtones.
[01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:27.840]   This is so '90s selling ringtones.
[01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:28.840]   I think we're seeing the...
[01:15:28.840 --> 01:15:31.640]   Can't you just take a Beatles song and make a ringtone?
[01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:32.640]   Yeah, you can.
[01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:37.520]   This is the specifics of that deal that Apple signed, that exclusive deal.
[01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:38.520]   It must have included...
[01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:39.520]   Right.
[01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:45.040]   You'll market our music for a couple of years and we'll do ringtones.
[01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:52.160]   Can you take a DRM song into GarageBand and build a ringtone and then export it back out?
[01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:54.160]   I don't think with DRM but it doesn't matter because there's no DRM.
[01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:55.440]   Oh, there's no DRM one on the internet.
[01:15:55.440 --> 01:15:56.640]   Yeah, so you just drag it in.
[01:15:56.640 --> 01:16:00.440]   You take it into GarageBand and GarageBand actually has a ringtone export, right?
[01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:04.520]   Yeah, you set a loop under 25 seconds and do an export ringtone and it comes out as an
[01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:05.520]   M4R.
[01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:07.720]   That's the point is you don't need to do any of that.
[01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:13.120]   Actually I used MacWorld had a really... has the best article on how to use match with all
[01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:17.520]   the details of the mess around with it and I realized I wasn't able to sync a lot of
[01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:21.680]   my music to my other phone, my Android phones because they were DRM'd.
[01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:22.680]   And so...
[01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:23.680]   It was my article.
[01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:24.680]   You guys told me how to do it.
[01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:25.680]   I deleted all my songs.
[01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:26.680]   First I matched.
[01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:30.800]   Yeah, you make a smart playlist that says only show the songs that have been matched or
[01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:36.480]   purchased that are basically recognized by iTunes in the cloud, iTunes Match and then
[01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:39.240]   you can actually delete them and it's super scary, right?
[01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:40.240]   It's very scary.
[01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:42.320]   And you tell them to move them to the trash but they're still in the trash if there's
[01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:46.320]   a problem and they all get great out and then you select them all and say download
[01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:47.320]   and it redownloads them.
[01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:49.920]   By the next day I had 256 AAC un-
[01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:50.920]   No DRM.
[01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:51.920]   Protected files.
[01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:52.920]   And they don't expire.
[01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:53.920]   There was some confusion about that.
[01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:56.880]   It's like when I unsubscribe from iTunes Match do they expire?
[01:16:56.880 --> 01:16:57.880]   They don't.
[01:16:57.880 --> 01:17:00.120]   You're paying that 25 bucks a year for the streaming.
[01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:02.320]   For the syncing service, yeah.
[01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:05.160]   That was just great to take all that DRM off of because I had bought up.
[01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:07.120]   There's a lot of stuff in the iTunes store.
[01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:11.040]   Any music that was a bad CD-RIP or that was a 128 MP3 or something.
[01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:15.080]   It's all like I had a list of things I had been meaning to re-RIP and that I just never
[01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:17.160]   gotten to and they all just work now.
[01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:18.160]   I never have to go back to the CD.
[01:17:18.160 --> 01:17:23.120]   I had some sub-96 kilobits stuff and I used I think it was your tip to...
[01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:24.120]   We talked about this the last time you were on.
[01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:25.120]   You converted 128 AAC.
[01:17:25.120 --> 01:17:28.120]   They still sound terrible but now they say they're a higher bit right?
[01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:29.120]   They don't like the coolest.
[01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:30.120]   And then it works.
[01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:32.120]   Oh they have to be 128 for it to download the new one.
[01:17:32.120 --> 01:17:33.280]   They have to be above 96.
[01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:35.280]   They have to be above 96.
[01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:36.280]   So I had it a lot.
[01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:37.280]   I don't know why.
[01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:38.280]   I probably got it from Napster.
[01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:39.280]   Napster?
[01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:40.280]   Yeah.
[01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:41.280]   Napster, Napster.
[01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:42.280]   That's great.
[01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:43.280]   Napster.
[01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:47.800]   And by the way I think that they sent a $10,000 check to the record companies for I am matched.
[01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:50.160]   Well to that little independent one I do.
[01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:54.520]   I thought that the terms were more like hundreds of millions of dollars for the record companies
[01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:56.040]   was kind of the payoff.
[01:17:56.040 --> 01:17:57.040]   Like here's the deal.
[01:17:57.040 --> 01:17:59.920]   We're going to set this all up so everyone doesn't have to think about this anymore.
[01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:02.240]   We'll pay you hundreds of millions of dollars to do that and we can do that because we have
[01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:05.880]   a hundred billion dollars in the bank and we're not really going to notice it.
[01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:08.640]   On Saturday I got a phone record company had a really great point.
[01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:11.640]   It wasn't that it was a windfall of money.
[01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:16.440]   It was that here is $10,000 of absolutely free money that we would not have gotten any
[01:18:16.440 --> 01:18:18.160]   other way, shape or form.
[01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:21.520]   So yes we're glad to simply have $200,000 more than we would have had otherwise.
[01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:23.040]   We're very happy.
[01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:24.920]   Thank you Apple.
[01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:30.800]   So I got a real good reason to read my emails in the future.
[01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:38.120]   Apparently, a guy named Matt Spacherrelli, like two months ago, told me that he had filed
[01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:44.560]   in small claims court in Ventura County to try to get, recover some money from AT&T because
[01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:50.840]   AT&T after using a mere gig and a half of bandwidth watching Netflix AT&T had throttled
[01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:51.840]   him.
[01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:53.320]   I just, you know, I get so much email.
[01:18:53.320 --> 01:18:54.320]   I missed it.
[01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:57.720]   He sent me another one saying tomorrow I'm going to be in court, missed that.
[01:18:57.720 --> 01:19:03.920]   So he called me on Saturday said, "Oh by the way, I won $850."
[01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:06.880]   The judge, Matt told us the story, it's great.
[01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:10.720]   It's on the tech guy, in fact I should pull it off the tech guy and play it at some point.
[01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:12.600]   It's on the tech guy show from Saturday.
[01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:17.520]   But the judge said, "Hey, small claims court is where justice happens in America.
[01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:24.660]   It is where the rubber meets the road and you are absolutely right, sir, that AT&T by
[01:19:24.660 --> 01:19:27.680]   promising you unlimited data."
[01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:29.680]   He was grandfathered in.
[01:19:29.680 --> 01:19:34.720]   "Isn't giving it to you when they throttle you, especially since people on limited plans
[01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:36.440]   don't see those restrictions."
[01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:38.440]   So I'm giving you $850.
[01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:42.560]   AT&T said they may appeal.
[01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:43.560]   They better appeal.
[01:19:43.560 --> 01:19:47.520]   You know, I'm hoping that he keeps the money and I'm hoping that it goes a little higher.
[01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:50.840]   But the thing is if they don't appeal enough of us decided we wanted to do something about
[01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:52.840]   that, it would just drive AT&T into the ground.
[01:19:52.840 --> 01:19:54.800]   I mean, they can't do a class action suit.
[01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:56.560]   You can't do it with the contract.
[01:19:56.560 --> 01:20:00.320]   But if everyone started showing up in small claims court that has these unlimited, not
[01:20:00.320 --> 01:20:01.320]   everyone.
[01:20:01.320 --> 01:20:02.320]   0.1%.
[01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:05.280]   AT&T's couldn't manage the legal load.
[01:20:05.280 --> 01:20:08.720]   Now, don't show this email because it's got his email address and his phone number and
[01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:10.280]   I don't want people bugging Matt.
[01:20:10.280 --> 01:20:11.720]   But he says, "Leo, it's cool to be on your show.
[01:20:11.720 --> 01:20:12.720]   Thanks for taking my call.
[01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:16.040]   Just want you to know my brother is going through the same throttling issue I am.
[01:20:16.040 --> 01:20:20.080]   On Monday, I'm going to file his case in the LA County Small Clothes Court and see if
[01:20:20.080 --> 01:20:21.640]   I can make it two for two."
[01:20:21.640 --> 01:20:24.880]   Matt, Matt is not a lawyer, but I play one in small claims court.
[01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:28.240]   I'm going to start seeing this like those commercials on basic cable TV.
[01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:29.240]   Matt's back of LA.
[01:20:29.240 --> 01:20:30.240]   I'm back of LA.
[01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:31.240]   What could the heavy his?
[01:20:31.240 --> 01:20:35.120]   Maybe you remember me from beating AT&T last week.
[01:20:35.120 --> 01:20:37.800]   I can't say he's your lawyer, but he could say he's your legal consultant.
[01:20:37.800 --> 01:20:40.200]   Right, because you don't use lawyers in small claims court.
[01:20:40.200 --> 01:20:41.200]   He could take 10%.
[01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:44.040]   Matt, this is a whole business model here.
[01:20:44.040 --> 01:20:45.880]   You could just be doing this every day.
[01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:47.280]   You could be showing up as a judge.
[01:20:47.280 --> 01:20:49.080]   He told me he watches a Mac break weekly.
[01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:52.040]   So Matt, hi and well done.
[01:20:52.040 --> 01:20:56.520]   AT&T, according to Jason's Mac World magazine, says they will appeal.
[01:20:56.520 --> 01:20:57.520]   I think it's a kind of...
[01:20:57.520 --> 01:20:58.520]   I have to.
[01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:01.720]   I mean, once it starts to become precedent, because if he's smart, he's going to say, "No,
[01:21:01.720 --> 01:21:03.320]   it's a precedent for this already."
[01:21:03.320 --> 01:21:04.320]   Blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:21:04.320 --> 01:21:05.320]   It's a precedent.
[01:21:05.320 --> 01:21:06.520]   We were kind of talking about this.
[01:21:06.520 --> 01:21:09.600]   It's apparently a precedent only in that jurisdiction.
[01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:11.120]   It's a small claims ruling.
[01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:13.720]   So it doesn't have a national precedent.
[01:21:13.720 --> 01:21:16.560]   It does have a national PR result.
[01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:19.880]   And you're right, there will be others who will attempt to do the same as a result.
[01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:24.040]   Even though it's not a legal precedent that's binding, the more times you're winning, the
[01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:25.240]   more times you're likely to win.
[01:21:25.240 --> 01:21:26.240]   I mean, that's the...
[01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:29.520]   I mean, the more people will come out of the woodwork and do it in their small claims
[01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:30.520]   court too.
[01:21:30.520 --> 01:21:36.200]   I'm just going to see Sprint using the iPhone really make the push the case for we are truly
[01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:38.200]   the only unlimited plan.
[01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:41.600]   It is an opportunity for a company like Sprint, which is essentially and also ran at this
[01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:46.200]   point to distinguish themselves against AT&T and Verizon, which also...
[01:21:46.200 --> 01:21:48.440]   I don't know if Verizon is throttling, but they don't have unlimited plans.
[01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:49.960]   I have an unlimited plan with Sprint.
[01:21:49.960 --> 01:21:54.040]   The only thing I don't understand is that every time I pick up my Galaxy that I'm not
[01:21:54.040 --> 01:21:56.080]   in this area, I get a roaming warning.
[01:21:56.080 --> 01:21:58.200]   And I don't know whether that is actually the case or not.
[01:21:58.200 --> 01:21:59.200]   I think that's...
[01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:00.200]   I hope that's not the case.
[01:22:00.200 --> 01:22:01.200]   Constantly, it's saying...
[01:22:01.200 --> 01:22:02.200]   I don't have that.
[01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:03.200]   I don't have that.
[01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:04.920]   I think that's something going on.
[01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:06.840]   I have a Sprint Galaxy, which I love.
[01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:07.840]   I love the Galaxy.
[01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:11.240]   I just don't use it because I go somewhere else and I get these roaming warnings.
[01:22:11.240 --> 01:22:12.640]   If someone knows why I'm getting those.
[01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:14.360]   What do you think about this article from Mars?
[01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:18.560]   Technica, Timothy B. Lee, if Android is a stolen product, and that's of course what
[01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:24.720]   Apple asserts and Steve Jobs asserted so eloquently, then so was the iPhone.
[01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:27.280]   It's a more inflammatory headline than the actual article.
[01:22:27.280 --> 01:22:30.640]   The actual story, and I don't make the mistake I did.
[01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:32.560]   Mars Technica's design makes it...
[01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:37.200]   It's a two-page article, and it's very hard to tell it ends sort of like this snide comment,
[01:22:37.200 --> 01:22:38.480]   and that's Page One.
[01:22:38.480 --> 01:22:41.200]   And if you only read Page One, you'll think, "Boy, this guy's kind of a jerk," because
[01:22:41.200 --> 01:22:45.400]   it's detailing all the different aspects of the iPhone that came before it.
[01:22:45.400 --> 01:22:49.160]   Even though Apple was the first company to put them all together in a product, which
[01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:50.800]   is not a small thing.
[01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:52.640]   It's a huge thing.
[01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:58.560]   Page Two, he's much more fair, that's the second act of the story, and his point is,
[01:22:58.560 --> 01:23:00.080]   "Look, there's a lot of back and forth now."
[01:23:00.080 --> 01:23:05.520]   And although it's true that I think that Android knocked off the iPhone, and Apple did a lot
[01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:09.080]   of synthesis of a lot of different stuff and made a product.
[01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:12.360]   And then you look at the Android designs before iPhone, and after...
[01:23:12.360 --> 01:23:16.200]   It's compared G1, which is Google's first phone, which was terrible.
[01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:17.480]   Yeah, it's shocking.
[01:23:17.480 --> 01:23:22.160]   And it came out just a few months after the first iPhone came out.
[01:23:22.160 --> 01:23:26.000]   And then subsequent phones from Samsung, which looked pretty much the same as an iPhone,
[01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:27.000]   it's clear they were influencing.
[01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.200]   But the point is, now we go back and forth.
[01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:31.080]   It's vice versa as well, as I mentioned.
[01:23:31.080 --> 01:23:35.400]   The notification system is now available in iOS 5, it's identical to that in the Android
[01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:36.400]   phone.
[01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:37.400]   And that's what users want.
[01:23:37.400 --> 01:23:40.160]   It's what happened with Windows and Mac OS.
[01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:41.560]   There's a back and forth.
[01:23:41.560 --> 01:23:47.200]   And we got the recycle bin on Windows, because Apple created the trash can on System 7.
[01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:49.160]   And that's a good thing for everybody in the long run.
[01:23:49.160 --> 01:23:54.000]   And I think you can overemphasize the fact that I do think Android, as we know, would
[01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.520]   not exist without the iPhone, have come into being.
[01:23:56.520 --> 01:23:58.240]   But no smartphone would, right?
[01:23:58.240 --> 01:24:01.400]   No, no modern smartphone would.
[01:24:01.400 --> 01:24:05.200]   That all said, it's not as if everything that Google's done with Android has been copying
[01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:06.200]   Apple.
[01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:08.400]   There's been some copying, and there's also been some advancement.
[01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:12.640]   And then Apple has taken some stuff that Google has done, because what's Apple going to do?
[01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:14.000]   Their notifications were bad.
[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:15.720]   So they made a better notification center.
[01:24:15.720 --> 01:24:17.360]   And I think Google got that right.
[01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:21.400]   So the Apple's notification looks like Google's, to a certain extent.
[01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:25.640]   Google's got those widgets on the home screen that Apple still doesn't have.
[01:24:25.640 --> 01:24:26.640]   I love the widgets.
[01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:27.640]   I like the back button.
[01:24:27.640 --> 01:24:30.480]   I know nobody else likes that, but I actually like the back button at all.
[01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:35.360]   My problem is I have to, on the iPhone, always back up all the way, and the back button lets
[01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:36.360]   you back up incremental.
[01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:37.360]   Right.
[01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:42.040]   The problem with the Android back button is you never, or the Windows phone back button,
[01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:43.800]   you never know quite where you're going to go.
[01:24:43.800 --> 01:24:44.800]   Right.
[01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:45.800]   That's the problem.
[01:24:45.800 --> 01:24:47.400]   What will happen?
[01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:52.360]   If you want to discuss one thing that really, so the difference between attention to detail,
[01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:57.720]   why would Google choose to make a back button that really looks like a reload button?
[01:24:57.720 --> 01:25:00.960]   There are times when there are three different versions of this loop-de-loop arrow button
[01:25:00.960 --> 01:25:01.960]   on the screen.
[01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:05.320]   And I don't know which one will take me back one with an application screen, which one
[01:25:05.320 --> 01:25:09.520]   will take me back one for the OS, and which one will simply reload this content that I
[01:25:09.520 --> 01:25:12.040]   just downloaded off the web.
[01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:20.240]   I mean, the concept of copying one or the others, I think has been really settled because Google
[01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:26.080]   is clearly pursuing a unique philosophy with Android that is different and opposite to
[01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:28.720]   what Apple is pursuing with iOS.
[01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:30.840]   And now my phone is talking and I apologize.
[01:25:30.840 --> 01:25:31.840]   I just stitched.
[01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:34.360]   Stitcher decided to start playing backs and breaking this.
[01:25:34.360 --> 01:25:35.360]   Wow.
[01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:36.920]   John, is your arm getting tired holding that thing?
[01:25:36.920 --> 01:25:37.920]   I love it.
[01:25:37.920 --> 01:25:40.680]   But people get mad when I talk about it, so I'm not going to mention it.
[01:25:40.680 --> 01:25:44.000]   Although we went viral a couple weeks ago when I was here and you had your iPhone and your
[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.800]   note next to each other and we took that overhead shot.
[01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:49.560]   Somebody took a screenshot of that and that was going around.
[01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:50.560]   Everybody had that as that.
[01:25:50.560 --> 01:25:52.560]   That was like the example of how huge that is.
[01:25:52.560 --> 01:25:54.400]   They thought it was a rumor of a new iPhone Nano.
[01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:57.800]   It's not a really large one.
[01:25:57.800 --> 01:26:00.200]   It can't be a larger tablet sized phone.
[01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:01.840]   No one would build that.
[01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:02.840]   Yeah.
[01:26:02.840 --> 01:26:03.840]   Yes.
[01:26:03.840 --> 01:26:04.840]   Let's see.
[01:26:04.840 --> 01:26:07.880]   We're going to move on here and just look and see if there's any stories that I have
[01:26:07.880 --> 01:26:10.760]   missed that I should have.
[01:26:10.760 --> 01:26:11.760]   I think we got them all in.
[01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:14.000]   The big story of course, March 7th.
[01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.200]   We're all excited about that.
[01:26:16.200 --> 01:26:17.200]   Yeah.
[01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:18.200]   When is that?
[01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:19.200]   Oh, that's next week.
[01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:20.200]   Next Wednesday.
[01:26:20.200 --> 01:26:21.200]   Next Wednesday, a week from tomorrow.
[01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:22.200]   So we're not going to be on next Tuesday.
[01:26:22.200 --> 01:26:26.520]   Oh, those of us on the East Coast barely have no time to get our shots.
[01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:27.520]   It's okay.
[01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:29.280]   California now, there's no more typhus.
[01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:30.280]   It's cool, man.
[01:26:30.280 --> 01:26:31.280]   It's okay.
[01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:32.280]   Just come on, hang out.
[01:26:32.280 --> 01:26:33.280]   You'll be all right.
[01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:37.000]   We've gotten rid of malaria in the central valley.
[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000]   It's been a mixture of nets and...
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.680]   Often, there's almost a thing of a path.
[01:26:41.680 --> 01:26:45.200]   Do not drink the water into Larry County.
[01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:46.200]   Just warn him.
[01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:47.200]   I really don't drink the water.
[01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:48.200]   No, it's in my state.
[01:26:48.200 --> 01:26:49.440]   No, I'm kidding.
[01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:50.440]   It's fine.
[01:26:50.440 --> 01:26:51.440]   We kid to Larry.
[01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:52.440]   I'm going to get emails from the Larry.
[01:26:52.440 --> 01:26:53.440]   The most beautiful tetra-loin.
[01:26:53.440 --> 01:26:54.800]   Tenderloin, that's different.
[01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:55.800]   Yeah.
[01:26:55.800 --> 01:26:57.520]   You can't grab your shoes after walking through the tenderloin.
[01:26:57.520 --> 01:27:00.400]   So yeah, that is a programming note.
[01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:05.360]   This show, which is normally on 11 a.m. Tuesday specific to P.M. Eastern on Tuesdays, we'll
[01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:10.920]   be on Wednesday and we'll start early 9.30 a.m. Pacific, 12.30 Eastern time.
[01:27:10.920 --> 01:27:12.000]   And while we will not...
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:15.400]   I don't believe that Apple will be doing a stream, so we will not be able to do our
[01:27:15.400 --> 01:27:16.400]   little talk...
[01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:21.120]   Our little Mystery Science Theater 3000 talking silhouettes at the screen.
[01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:24.120]   We will, of course, monitor all the live blogs.
[01:27:24.120 --> 01:27:26.520]   Macworld will be there doing its live blog.
[01:27:26.520 --> 01:27:29.480]   Everybody else will just synthesize that.
[01:27:29.480 --> 01:27:32.560]   Alex and Tom and I will make snarky comments.
[01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:35.600]   And then, if we can, we'll have a camera down there.
[01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:40.280]   And afterwards, if we can, we'll try to play with the iPad 3 if they allow us.
[01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:41.680]   So that's exciting.
[01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:43.920]   That is next Wednesday.
[01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:45.960]   How exciting is that?
[01:27:45.960 --> 01:27:50.120]   And now would be a good time to sell your iPad, too.
[01:27:50.120 --> 01:27:51.800]   Which brings me to Gazelle.
[01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:53.720]   Gazelle is a great way.
[01:27:53.720 --> 01:27:57.400]   Look, gadgets move through my hands probably faster than most people.
[01:27:57.400 --> 01:28:02.360]   And Gazelle has been a great boon for me on taking the gadgets that otherwise just kind
[01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:06.760]   of gathered dust in the closet of the drawers and selling them and getting cash for them.
[01:28:06.760 --> 01:28:07.760]   Here's what you do.
[01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:09.640]   You go to gazelle.com.
[01:28:09.640 --> 01:28:15.000]   I just entered iPad 2 and it said, you know, first it's going to ask you, well, if it's
[01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:18.040]   normal quality, in fact, mine is kind of beat up.
[01:28:18.040 --> 01:28:21.120]   260 bucks out the door.
[01:28:21.120 --> 01:28:24.280]   They pay the shipping on anything worth more than a buck.
[01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:25.280]   And here's a nice thing.
[01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:26.280]   You can get a check.
[01:28:26.280 --> 01:28:28.760]   PayPal, you can get a Walmart gift card.
[01:28:28.760 --> 01:28:31.280]   But if you get the Amazon gift card, that's the one right on top.
[01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:36.520]   You get an additional 5% bonus that kind of rebate their, you know, the Amazon affiliate
[01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:37.520]   fee to you.
[01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:40.520]   So that's really a great way to get cash.
[01:28:40.520 --> 01:28:41.520]   So let's see.
[01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:44.000]   I'm just going to add this to my shopping cart.
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:47.440]   And then I'm going to go back and, you know, as long as you're doing it, get a box and
[01:28:47.440 --> 01:28:53.240]   go through all your old stuff, add more old stuff to your Gazelle box.
[01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:57.640]   They pay the shipping, hundreds of dollars coming your way from Gazelle.
[01:28:57.640 --> 01:28:59.960]   It really is a great way to recycle your gadgets.
[01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:02.440]   And if you have gadgets that have no value, don't worry about it.
[01:29:02.440 --> 01:29:05.520]   Gazelle does eco-friendly recycling, green recycling.
[01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:06.960]   It will not land in the landfill.
[01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:09.960]   It will not go overseas.
[01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:14.560]   They use green recyclers to take advantage of all of the, you know, the good stuff that
[01:29:14.560 --> 01:29:16.640]   is in your old electronics.
[01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:17.640]   Don't sell it.
[01:29:17.640 --> 01:29:19.680]   Gazelle, G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.
[01:29:19.680 --> 01:29:24.080]   And remember that the price, in fact, if you do, I'll show you what they do, they give
[01:29:24.080 --> 01:29:29.600]   you a really neat graph of how the price is dropping.
[01:29:29.600 --> 01:29:36.560]   If you, actually, I guess they don't, if you do the iPad because it's like a special,
[01:29:36.560 --> 01:29:37.560]   special thing.
[01:29:37.560 --> 01:29:41.760]   But if you do most devices, let's say a Galaxy, to...
[01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:43.040]   My zoom is worth $64.
[01:29:43.040 --> 01:29:46.160]   They'll show you a graph.
[01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:51.680]   And the thing to understand is that prices are dropping every day.
[01:29:51.680 --> 01:29:54.360]   So let's say no noticeable flaws.
[01:29:54.360 --> 01:29:56.360]   I got all the things.
[01:29:56.360 --> 01:29:58.520]   It is free of water damage.
[01:29:58.520 --> 01:30:00.520]   Yes.
[01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:01.520]   And then continue.
[01:30:01.520 --> 01:30:03.200]   It's going to give you the offer.
[01:30:03.200 --> 01:30:04.200]   And then it's...
[01:30:04.200 --> 01:30:06.320]   I guess they don't do that anymore.
[01:30:06.320 --> 01:30:07.320]   They used to have this graph.
[01:30:07.320 --> 01:30:14.200]   It was so cool of the value and the point being that it drops rapidly.
[01:30:14.200 --> 01:30:17.480]   So every day you wait is a day, a dollar or two less you're going to get.
[01:30:17.480 --> 01:30:18.640]   Take advantage of it now.
[01:30:18.640 --> 01:30:20.120]   Get those gadgets together.
[01:30:20.120 --> 01:30:24.000]   When the iPad 3 comes out, I can guarantee you the iPad 2 will be worth less than it is
[01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:25.000]   right now.
[01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:26.680]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.com.
[01:30:26.680 --> 01:30:29.520]   If you know you're going to get an iPad 3, do it.
[01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:31.400]   Don't waste any time.
[01:30:31.400 --> 01:30:33.200]   Gazelle.com.
[01:30:33.200 --> 01:30:37.280]   Recycle and get some money while you're at it.
[01:30:37.280 --> 01:30:38.280]   It's time for our...
[01:30:38.280 --> 01:30:43.680]   Do you want to do an iOS tip or do you want to save that time for your Photoshop demo?
[01:30:43.680 --> 01:30:44.680]   I can do either.
[01:30:44.680 --> 01:30:45.680]   I can do it on iOS.
[01:30:45.680 --> 01:30:46.680]   Jason has one too.
[01:30:46.680 --> 01:30:47.680]   Jason, all right.
[01:30:47.680 --> 01:30:48.680]   Jason, you do it.
[01:30:48.680 --> 01:30:49.680]   Got a tip?
[01:30:49.680 --> 01:30:50.680]   Yeah.
[01:30:50.680 --> 01:30:51.680]   All right.
[01:30:51.680 --> 01:30:52.680]   Yeah.
[01:30:52.680 --> 01:30:53.680]   All right.
[01:30:53.680 --> 01:30:54.680]   Here it is.
[01:30:54.680 --> 01:30:55.680]   Let me explain this to you.
[01:30:55.680 --> 01:30:56.680]   You get five gigabytes of storage when you sign up for iCloud.
[01:30:56.680 --> 01:30:57.680]   Yes.
[01:30:57.680 --> 01:31:00.080]   And let's say you've got a couple devices, an iPad and an iPhone and you're backing them
[01:31:00.080 --> 01:31:01.080]   both up.
[01:31:01.080 --> 01:31:05.600]   Very quickly you may get that case where iCloud yells at you and says, "Sorry.
[01:31:05.600 --> 01:31:06.600]   I'm full up.
[01:31:06.600 --> 01:31:07.920]   Would you like to buy more?
[01:31:07.920 --> 01:31:09.920]   Would you like to give Apple some more money?"
[01:31:09.920 --> 01:31:14.520]   And you can do that or you can take control of your iCloud backup settings by doing this.
[01:31:14.520 --> 01:31:21.240]   Go to Settings, then tap on iCloud, then tap on Storage and Backup, and then tap again
[01:31:21.240 --> 01:31:22.880]   on Managed Storage.
[01:31:22.880 --> 01:31:28.520]   You end up in this Managed Storage area where it's got your backups and also a list of other
[01:31:28.520 --> 01:31:30.800]   stuff that you're storing on iCloud.
[01:31:30.800 --> 01:31:35.240]   If you tap on the backup of the device you're using or any of the backups on there, you
[01:31:35.240 --> 01:31:36.680]   actually get this list of...
[01:31:36.680 --> 01:31:41.600]   I think it's the top five apps that you're using that are storing things on iCloud that
[01:31:41.600 --> 01:31:43.920]   are backing up to iCloud.
[01:31:43.920 --> 01:31:47.520]   And all of the data that's on your phone or your iPad is being stored on iCloud for
[01:31:47.520 --> 01:31:49.040]   backup purposes.
[01:31:49.040 --> 01:31:54.000]   You can turn off app by app what gets stored in an iCloud.
[01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:55.000]   What a good idea.
[01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:59.600]   So the top five by storage size are listed and you can also tap on the item below it,
[01:31:59.600 --> 01:32:01.160]   which is called Show All Apps.
[01:32:01.160 --> 01:32:06.600]   It'll list every app that's being backed up on your device, turn the off button on the
[01:32:06.600 --> 01:32:09.120]   ones where you're like, "This is a podcast tool.
[01:32:09.120 --> 01:32:10.960]   It's just backing up my podcast.
[01:32:10.960 --> 01:32:11.960]   They're available.
[01:32:11.960 --> 01:32:12.960]   I don't need to do that.
[01:32:12.960 --> 01:32:15.200]   You flip it off and you're saving space as you go."
[01:32:15.200 --> 01:32:20.440]   And you can very quickly get back that space, reclaim your backup space on iCloud, and not
[01:32:20.440 --> 01:32:21.960]   have to spend money on more iCloud storage.
[01:32:21.960 --> 01:32:22.960]   It's amazing.
[01:32:22.960 --> 01:32:23.960]   It's amazing.
[01:32:23.960 --> 01:32:27.320]   Apple gives you complete control over what you're backing up.
[01:32:27.320 --> 01:32:30.760]   And so check it out in Settings, iCloud, Storage and Backup.
[01:32:30.760 --> 01:32:31.960]   Just tap around in there.
[01:32:31.960 --> 01:32:37.400]   You can save a lot of time and a lot of money if you don't want to buy 20 gigs of iCloud
[01:32:37.400 --> 01:32:38.400]   space.
[01:32:38.400 --> 01:32:39.720]   I wish they'd do that with PhotoStream.
[01:32:39.720 --> 01:32:40.720]   I'd love to just...
[01:32:40.720 --> 01:32:41.720]   You can turn off PhotoStream.
[01:32:41.720 --> 01:32:43.120]   You can only turn off the whole thing though.
[01:32:43.120 --> 01:32:44.600]   I want to delete some of those photos.
[01:32:44.600 --> 01:32:45.600]   You know what I'm saying?
[01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:46.600]   You know what I'm saying?
[01:32:46.600 --> 01:32:47.600]   I know what you're saying.
[01:32:47.600 --> 01:32:49.600]   You can not back up your camera roll though.
[01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:50.600]   That's what I've done.
[01:32:50.600 --> 01:32:51.600]   That's what I've done.
[01:32:51.600 --> 01:32:52.600]   That's what I've done.
[01:32:52.600 --> 01:32:53.600]   Turn off the camera roll back.
[01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:56.520]   Yeah, no longer will I store those on pictures I take.
[01:32:56.520 --> 01:32:59.880]   I would like to save it the record that Jason's tip is way better than mine.
[01:32:59.880 --> 01:33:01.800]   Well, don't do yours.
[01:33:01.800 --> 01:33:02.800]   Save it for...
[01:33:02.800 --> 01:33:03.800]   Save it some another time.
[01:33:03.800 --> 01:33:04.800]   Another week.
[01:33:04.800 --> 01:33:05.800]   Another week.
[01:33:05.800 --> 01:33:06.800]   I'll have to think about it.
[01:33:06.800 --> 01:33:07.800]   Andy, do you want to do an OS X tip?
[01:33:07.800 --> 01:33:09.640]   Yeah, this is a quick one.
[01:33:09.640 --> 01:33:15.520]   One of those cool little features that they've added to preview in 10.7 is that they've added
[01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:19.880]   a lot of annotation features for PDFs, but they've also added electronic document signature.
[01:33:19.880 --> 01:33:24.520]   We're not talking about the sort of thing where you use a special key and it's digitally
[01:33:24.520 --> 01:33:25.520]   signed.
[01:33:25.520 --> 01:33:29.960]   It means that actually putting a facsimile of your signature on the document, I think
[01:33:29.960 --> 01:33:35.080]   almost everybody in this conversation is at one point to get a loan of a piece of hardware.
[01:33:35.080 --> 01:33:39.960]   You'll be emailed a document which you then have to print out and then sign and then scan
[01:33:39.960 --> 01:33:41.840]   and then email back.
[01:33:41.840 --> 01:33:44.760]   If you're using preview though, you don't have to do all that.
[01:33:44.760 --> 01:33:48.640]   Just open up the file as a PDF.
[01:33:48.640 --> 01:33:51.600]   Click on the button to open the annotations tools.
[01:33:51.600 --> 01:33:56.720]   If there's actually a signature tool in that toolbar on the dropdown, there's a really
[01:33:56.720 --> 01:34:00.840]   cool little widget that will let you capture your signature.
[01:34:00.840 --> 01:34:05.240]   Literally all you do is you get a Sharpie, some good black marker, just sign a piece
[01:34:05.240 --> 01:34:06.560]   of card.
[01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:09.560]   You hold up the card to the your eyesight camera.
[01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:13.400]   There's actually a little box with a little blue underscore saying, and as soon as it
[01:34:13.400 --> 01:34:17.320]   gets a sharp image of some, something, it looks like a signature that fills that box.
[01:34:17.320 --> 01:34:21.560]   It captures it and it restores it so you can store multiple different versions of your
[01:34:21.560 --> 01:34:25.520]   signatures or initials or little smiles with happy faces.
[01:34:25.520 --> 01:34:29.900]   Then when you just click on the signature annotation tool, you can then simply draw a
[01:34:29.900 --> 01:34:35.640]   box and it'll plant that digital version of your signature right in the middle of the
[01:34:35.640 --> 01:34:36.640]   document.
[01:34:36.640 --> 01:34:40.680]   You can then save it and then email it as a file attachment and you will get your new
[01:34:40.680 --> 01:34:42.480]   iPad 3 demo hardware.
[01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:43.480]   Oops.
[01:34:43.480 --> 01:34:44.480]   I didn't say that.
[01:34:44.480 --> 01:34:47.800]   I'm not under it.
[01:34:47.800 --> 01:34:52.280]   I just discovered that last week and it was stunning.
[01:34:52.280 --> 01:34:53.840]   I was like, "No way."
[01:34:53.840 --> 01:34:57.800]   It's always the hardest part is trying to get the signature, no matter what you're going
[01:34:57.800 --> 01:35:02.240]   to do if you're using some signing program or whatever, am I going to use my touchpad
[01:35:02.240 --> 01:35:07.320]   or do I have to go back and get my bamboo or some kind of whack-um tablet or whatever?
[01:35:07.320 --> 01:35:10.640]   The idea that you can just sit there and draw on it and just put it up and it has a whole
[01:35:10.640 --> 01:35:13.880]   system so that you can just put it up in front of your little eyesight and boom, it
[01:35:13.880 --> 01:35:17.120]   grabs it and it works so well.
[01:35:17.120 --> 01:35:18.880]   So that's great.
[01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:20.280]   Let's see.
[01:35:20.280 --> 01:35:22.360]   We have some pics now, do we not?
[01:35:22.360 --> 01:35:23.360]   Yes.
[01:35:23.360 --> 01:35:24.360]   I think since you're going to want...
[01:35:24.360 --> 01:35:25.360]   Now, do we have an over-the-shoulder camera?
[01:35:25.360 --> 01:35:27.520]   Let me work on that really quick.
[01:35:27.520 --> 01:35:28.520]   Okay.
[01:35:28.520 --> 01:35:32.280]   Because Alex wants to demo Photoshop Touch.
[01:35:32.280 --> 01:35:35.720]   This is not PSS Express which has been out for some time.
[01:35:35.720 --> 01:35:36.720]   This is $10.
[01:35:36.720 --> 01:35:43.200]   Photoshop apparently is including things like layers in an iPad app and it's got to be
[01:35:43.200 --> 01:35:48.400]   given the release timing kind of aimed a little bit at the iPad 3 as much as the iPad 2.
[01:35:48.400 --> 01:35:49.960]   So Alex, we've got...
[01:35:49.960 --> 01:35:50.960]   So you're in the...
[01:35:50.960 --> 01:35:51.960]   There we go.
[01:35:51.960 --> 01:35:52.960]   There you go.
[01:35:52.960 --> 01:35:53.960]   Look, there's Malachi.
[01:35:53.960 --> 01:35:54.960]   Or is that Isabella?
[01:35:54.960 --> 01:35:57.160]   No, that's Malachi before he got his haircut.
[01:35:57.160 --> 01:35:58.960]   Yeah, I love those threads.
[01:35:58.960 --> 01:36:00.960]   So anyway, so there's my little...
[01:36:00.960 --> 01:36:06.360]   You're going to have to reposition to get all of the glare out of there.
[01:36:06.360 --> 01:36:07.360]   There we go.
[01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:08.360]   There you go.
[01:36:08.360 --> 01:36:09.360]   Do you get that?
[01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:10.440]   Maybe over to the right a little more.
[01:36:10.440 --> 01:36:11.440]   More to the right.
[01:36:11.440 --> 01:36:12.440]   More to the right.
[01:36:12.440 --> 01:36:13.440]   And there we go.
[01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:14.440]   Oh, okay.
[01:36:14.440 --> 01:36:15.440]   $10.
[01:36:15.440 --> 01:36:17.200]   It's in the store now.
[01:36:17.200 --> 01:36:20.960]   So this is what happens when I leave my iPad laying around the house as I get tons of
[01:36:20.960 --> 01:36:22.960]   little photos of my kids.
[01:36:22.960 --> 01:36:23.960]   So he took that.
[01:36:23.960 --> 01:36:24.960]   He took that up as a little.
[01:36:24.960 --> 01:36:25.960]   That's really cute.
[01:36:25.960 --> 01:36:28.160]   They take lots of pictures of the ceiling and of themselves.
[01:36:28.160 --> 01:36:35.400]   So anyway, so the thing is, of course, you can zoom in and out.
[01:36:35.400 --> 01:36:39.720]   And it really is, I find it to be fairly fluid.
[01:36:39.720 --> 01:36:44.240]   You can... what's interesting is here, you can go new layer and I can say I can delete
[01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:46.560]   the... these are the different controls of the layers.
[01:36:46.560 --> 01:36:47.560]   That's the layer control.
[01:36:47.560 --> 01:36:50.960]   If I want to add a new layer, I can say I want to duplicate that layer, for instance.
[01:36:50.960 --> 01:36:54.000]   And so now you can see two layers that are there.
[01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:58.400]   Now you have effects, which are... the only thing I'm kind of surprised at is that they
[01:36:58.400 --> 01:37:00.640]   didn't do some kind of live effect where it shows the...
[01:37:00.640 --> 01:37:01.640]   Wouldn't that be nice?
[01:37:01.640 --> 01:37:02.640]   The pieces.
[01:37:02.640 --> 01:37:07.920]   And I will say the one thing about the Photoshop touches that it doesn't feel as iPad-y as I
[01:37:07.920 --> 01:37:08.920]   would have expected.
[01:37:08.920 --> 01:37:10.920]   It's not quite as...
[01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:13.320]   That's too bad.
[01:37:13.320 --> 01:37:14.760]   But I think that those are all things they can add.
[01:37:14.760 --> 01:37:18.880]   Now, here's the Gaussian blur and you can see that it's fairly responsive.
[01:37:18.880 --> 01:37:23.880]   I mean, it isn't doing it fluidly when you're moving it, but as soon as you let go, you're
[01:37:23.880 --> 01:37:24.880]   getting that.
[01:37:24.880 --> 01:37:26.400]   And I can go in here, for instance, and let's say blur it.
[01:37:26.400 --> 01:37:27.840]   I can say apply.
[01:37:27.840 --> 01:37:32.080]   I can go back here and say layer controls and I want to change my blend mode and make
[01:37:32.080 --> 01:37:36.320]   it screen so it kind of has that kind of... maybe pull it back a little bit.
[01:37:36.320 --> 01:37:40.280]   And so I have a lot of control there.
[01:37:40.280 --> 01:37:45.880]   Obviously you can go in here and start to do extractions.
[01:37:45.880 --> 01:37:52.200]   One of the things that I think is pretty revolutionary beyond the actual piece here.
[01:37:52.200 --> 01:37:55.960]   Now, by the way, some of the stuff you wish you saw in regular Photoshop, look at these
[01:37:55.960 --> 01:37:56.960]   curves.
[01:37:56.960 --> 01:37:57.960]   Really?
[01:37:57.960 --> 01:37:58.960]   Look at the curves.
[01:37:58.960 --> 01:37:59.960]   How easy is that?
[01:37:59.960 --> 01:38:00.960]   I mean, it's just this beautiful...
[01:38:00.960 --> 01:38:02.960]   We can't see it a lot because I'm applying it to the top layer.
[01:38:02.960 --> 01:38:05.560]   I can grab the bottom layer here.
[01:38:05.560 --> 01:38:10.320]   And the curves, for instance, any of these controls, but when you look at the levels,
[01:38:10.320 --> 01:38:18.480]   I wish levels looked like this in the actual...
[01:38:18.480 --> 01:38:20.560]   In actuality.
[01:38:20.560 --> 01:38:21.560]   In actuality there.
[01:38:21.560 --> 01:38:23.360]   I think it's a little rendering error there right now.
[01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:27.320]   But anyway, I have to say, if you're taking photos and you want to edit them, there's
[01:38:27.320 --> 01:38:28.560]   a lot of great edit tools.
[01:38:28.560 --> 01:38:31.560]   Snap seed is, I think, one of my favorites is grabbing great things.
[01:38:31.560 --> 01:38:35.520]   But if you want a little bit of more control, this is definitely one of those apps.
[01:38:35.520 --> 01:38:44.280]   That is a must-own to edit in the field of pictures that you're taking.
[01:38:44.280 --> 01:38:46.240]   It's truly amazing.
[01:38:46.240 --> 01:38:49.680]   One of the things that I really like about it is see this here.
[01:38:49.680 --> 01:38:51.080]   They see the tutorials.
[01:38:51.080 --> 01:38:52.240]   This is so well thought out.
[01:38:52.240 --> 01:38:54.200]   And I'm surprised that other apps haven't done this in the last.
[01:38:54.200 --> 01:38:55.840]   You might just buy it for the tutorials.
[01:38:55.840 --> 01:38:57.840]   Yeah, look at this.
[01:38:57.840 --> 01:39:00.040]   What's really cool is they integrated it to the application.
[01:39:00.040 --> 01:39:02.960]   So you say, "Okay, this is what we're going to show you how to do."
[01:39:02.960 --> 01:39:05.960]   And we're going to say, "Begin Tutorial."
[01:39:05.960 --> 01:39:07.720]   And look, see down here?
[01:39:07.720 --> 01:39:08.720]   Step one.
[01:39:08.720 --> 01:39:10.960]   And it tells you exactly what you want to do.
[01:39:10.960 --> 01:39:12.200]   This is how you want to handle it.
[01:39:12.200 --> 01:39:14.400]   So you can click this little button and now it's here.
[01:39:14.400 --> 01:39:17.120]   And I can say, "Okay, go forward."
[01:39:17.120 --> 01:39:18.840]   The graphics too large.
[01:39:18.840 --> 01:39:19.840]   Let's transform it.
[01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:22.600]   And it gives you a little pointer to go to it.
[01:39:22.600 --> 01:39:26.080]   And so this is one of the hardest things when you get a new one of these applications
[01:39:26.080 --> 01:39:30.800]   is trying to figure out how to actually use it.
[01:39:30.800 --> 01:39:32.760]   And so it gives you a lot of these tutorials.
[01:39:32.760 --> 01:39:37.440]   This tutorial is so well done as far as integrating it completely into the application.
[01:39:37.440 --> 01:39:39.520]   So it's not something you're reading separately.
[01:39:39.520 --> 01:39:40.600]   It's integrated into it.
[01:39:40.600 --> 01:39:46.600]   It allows you to really do a lot of these things by just following the instructions.
[01:39:46.600 --> 01:39:48.600]   I did a couple of them all at one time.
[01:39:48.600 --> 01:39:51.000]   Anyway, and there's little tips that pop up.
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.720]   So you can say, "Okay, I want to set that to darken."
[01:39:53.720 --> 01:39:55.480]   And it tells you what darken means.
[01:39:55.480 --> 01:39:56.600]   It's really well integrated.
[01:39:56.600 --> 01:40:00.920]   And I think it makes a massive difference on how quickly you'll take full advantage of
[01:40:00.920 --> 01:40:05.040]   the application is the fact that -- and I think that literally incorporating the tutorial
[01:40:05.040 --> 01:40:09.440]   process into the application doubles or triples its value.
[01:40:09.440 --> 01:40:11.520]   Because you will use the whole application.
[01:40:11.520 --> 01:40:15.480]   You can spend literally a lunchtime going through all the tutorials and you will understand
[01:40:15.480 --> 01:40:17.080]   fully what's there.
[01:40:17.080 --> 01:40:25.840]   And I challenge other programming folks to really take that on.
[01:40:25.840 --> 01:40:28.160]   So I think that Adobe knocked it out of the park with that.
[01:40:28.160 --> 01:40:33.120]   So anyway, for $9.99, my question is really when do they start making more money with
[01:40:33.120 --> 01:40:35.120]   the iPad version than the real version?
[01:40:35.120 --> 01:40:38.400]   Well, they'd have to sell how many more.
[01:40:38.400 --> 01:40:39.400]   Yeah?
[01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:41.520]   I mean, it's $1.70 or something.
[01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:43.200]   Remember, a lot of those are upgrades.
[01:40:43.200 --> 01:40:45.440]   And the question is how many people are upgrading.
[01:40:45.440 --> 01:40:47.240]   I mean, that's always the challenge.
[01:40:47.240 --> 01:40:49.400]   And so I think we have a lot of computers that have older--
[01:40:49.400 --> 01:40:51.040]   I bet you people buy both.
[01:40:51.040 --> 01:40:52.040]   Oh, yeah.
[01:40:52.040 --> 01:40:53.040]   No, I think they'll buy both.
[01:40:53.040 --> 01:40:56.480]   I think that you'll see a lot of people.
[01:40:56.480 --> 01:41:00.080]   So that's not PSExpress's Photoshop touch.
[01:41:00.080 --> 01:41:02.520]   And it is available now in the App Store.
[01:41:02.520 --> 01:41:03.520]   There's no iPhone version, obviously.
[01:41:03.520 --> 01:41:04.520]   iPad 2 only.
[01:41:04.520 --> 01:41:07.400]   iPad 2 only, but $10.
[01:41:07.400 --> 01:41:08.400]   This is really--
[01:41:08.400 --> 01:41:09.400]   That's a great deal.
[01:41:09.400 --> 01:41:10.400]   You're going to get it from any--
[01:41:10.400 --> 01:41:11.400]   You're right.
[01:41:11.400 --> 01:41:13.520]   Everybody who does photography at all.
[01:41:13.520 --> 01:41:15.800]   If you ever want to edit anything that you're going to put up with your blog--
[01:41:15.800 --> 01:41:16.800]   You can use it from your iPad.
[01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:18.520]   If you're adjusting it, send it to friends.
[01:41:18.520 --> 01:41:21.520]   I mean, if you're taking any photos with your iPad, you should have it.
[01:41:21.520 --> 01:41:22.520]   You should be using it.
[01:41:22.520 --> 01:41:23.520]   OK.
[01:41:23.520 --> 01:41:26.160]   Mr. Jason Stel, do you have a pick for us?
[01:41:26.160 --> 01:41:27.400]   I do.
[01:41:27.400 --> 01:41:31.200]   My picks are related to the text format called Markdown.
[01:41:31.200 --> 01:41:33.200]   I actually write most of my stuff in Markdown now.
[01:41:33.200 --> 01:41:37.560]   It's basically-- you can write with italics and bold and hyperlinks and stuff
[01:41:37.560 --> 01:41:39.960]   without actually needing an app that supports those things.
[01:41:39.960 --> 01:41:41.520]   You can just use plain text.
[01:41:41.520 --> 01:41:45.520]   And then the Markdown script converts it and makes it all pretty and stylized.
[01:41:45.520 --> 01:41:47.440]   And most of them Mac world writers use that now.
[01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:49.520]   And I'm a bunch of other people.
[01:41:49.520 --> 01:41:56.680]   There is a nice utility for $4 by Brett Terpstra called Marked at markdapp.com.
[01:41:56.680 --> 01:41:58.680]   And it's in the App Store, I believe, too.
[01:41:58.680 --> 01:42:03.640]   And basically, you drag a Markdown file on it, and it shows it to you in a full HTML
[01:42:03.640 --> 01:42:04.480]   preview.
[01:42:04.480 --> 01:42:06.520]   So you can be working in one writing.
[01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:07.040]   Oh, that's handy.
[01:42:07.040 --> 01:42:11.320]   And as you're writing, the other app marked is updating and showing you exactly how it'll
[01:42:11.320 --> 01:42:13.120]   look like when it's on the web.
[01:42:13.120 --> 01:42:15.800]   So you have this two-pane view, which is really nice.
[01:42:15.800 --> 01:42:17.520]   So that's a nice little utility.
[01:42:17.520 --> 01:42:21.760]   And then I also wanted to mention another Markdown related thing.
[01:42:21.760 --> 01:42:27.240]   There's this new format called Fountain, which is based on Markdown, but it's for screenplays.
[01:42:27.240 --> 01:42:29.640]   And it's from John August, the screenwriter.
[01:42:29.640 --> 01:42:37.520]   And he's also working on an app called Highland, which basically converts from final draft
[01:42:37.520 --> 01:42:44.040]   format and back so that you can actually write in plain text and then drag it on this app.
[01:42:44.040 --> 01:42:48.640]   And it will convert it into a final draft file, which is pretty clever because it means
[01:42:48.640 --> 01:42:53.120]   that for people who are aspiring screenwriters maybe but they don't have access to final draft,
[01:42:53.120 --> 01:42:56.080]   they can write a plain text screenplay format.
[01:42:56.080 --> 01:42:59.480]   And there will be a sort of standard for understanding how it works.
[01:42:59.480 --> 01:43:04.320]   So it's a bunch of interesting stuff going on with this Markdown related stuff where
[01:43:04.320 --> 01:43:06.880]   you're writing and you're not really concerned about the output.
[01:43:06.880 --> 01:43:08.880]   You're writing this sort of standard format.
[01:43:08.880 --> 01:43:11.880]   And then there's an app or a script or something that turns it into whatever you want it to
[01:43:11.880 --> 01:43:12.880]   be at the end.
[01:43:12.880 --> 01:43:13.880]   It's cool stuff.
[01:43:13.880 --> 01:43:16.280]   You know, it's called marked M-A-R-K-E-D.
[01:43:16.280 --> 01:43:19.000]   It is in the app store or marked app.com.
[01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.560]   Yeah, four bucks, four bucks.
[01:43:21.560 --> 01:43:24.800]   Andy and that co, you pick it a week, sir.
[01:43:24.800 --> 01:43:27.480]   My pick is an nostalgia trip for people.
[01:43:27.480 --> 01:43:28.480]   It's Donkey Kong.
[01:43:28.480 --> 01:43:29.480]   Oh, rampage.
[01:43:29.480 --> 01:43:31.080]   No, no, no, it's rampage.
[01:43:31.080 --> 01:43:34.840]   It's actually Midway Arcade.
[01:43:34.840 --> 01:43:38.800]   Midway has done an iPad version of their classic 80s arcade games.
[01:43:38.800 --> 01:43:40.600]   I love this.
[01:43:40.600 --> 01:43:41.600]   Yeah.
[01:43:41.600 --> 01:43:43.360]   They've done it in exactly the right way though.
[01:43:43.360 --> 01:43:46.000]   They didn't try to update them and make them HD.
[01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:50.160]   They just simply said, let's just take the ROMs we already have.
[01:43:50.160 --> 01:43:52.240]   We'll just have like sort of a main player for them.
[01:43:52.240 --> 01:43:53.240]   Very pretty like 3D.
[01:43:53.240 --> 01:43:56.960]   Oh, you're going through a 3D arcade and you get to click on the machine that you want
[01:43:56.960 --> 01:43:58.360]   to actually play.
[01:43:58.360 --> 01:44:03.560]   But the idea is that I think they've clicked into the idea that those of us who grew up
[01:44:03.560 --> 01:44:09.280]   playing games like this, like Defender, like Tapper, like Rampage.
[01:44:09.280 --> 01:44:10.280]   Joust.
[01:44:10.280 --> 01:44:11.800]   Oh, yeah, they don't write.
[01:44:11.800 --> 01:44:12.800]   Is Joust on there?
[01:44:12.800 --> 01:44:13.800]   Joust is on there.
[01:44:13.800 --> 01:44:14.800]   Oh, yeah.
[01:44:14.800 --> 01:44:16.200]   I was playing Defender all night.
[01:44:16.200 --> 01:44:18.880]   I was like, that doesn't games for dirt cheap.
[01:44:18.880 --> 01:44:22.000]   It's sort of like we want to hear Elvis Costolo.
[01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.040]   My name is true, the original album.
[01:44:24.040 --> 01:44:28.960]   We don't want to hear the cast of Glee perform their version of it in 2012.
[01:44:28.960 --> 01:44:31.920]   So yes, this will take you right back to the Candleton bowling alley.
[01:44:31.920 --> 01:44:32.920]   Neat.
[01:44:32.920 --> 01:44:37.040]   Where used to go like twice a week and spend every quarter that you could dig out of every
[01:44:37.040 --> 01:44:41.360]   payphone that you discovered on the walk over to the bowling alley so that you could play
[01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:42.880]   as many of these games as possible.
[01:44:42.880 --> 01:44:44.480]   It is completely accurate.
[01:44:44.480 --> 01:44:51.040]   The only two quippals with it, number one, I would much rather just see a simple grid
[01:44:51.040 --> 01:44:53.720]   of games titles like the Gone.
[01:44:53.720 --> 01:44:58.520]   They just give you these stupid, laborious, there's a 3D version of this huge arcade with
[01:44:58.520 --> 01:45:03.200]   all these games in it that you can't really see what games are there until you tap on
[01:45:03.200 --> 01:45:07.280]   one of them and then they do this extremely stupid and laboriously slow camera move to
[01:45:07.280 --> 01:45:11.880]   show you how well they do open GL to get to the game cabinet.
[01:45:11.880 --> 01:45:16.360]   Also the game controls themselves are they try to approximate the buttons and the joysticks
[01:45:16.360 --> 01:45:17.960]   you would have with the original game.
[01:45:17.960 --> 01:45:23.240]   So it takes a little bit sometimes to slide your thumb, be sliding your thumb across the
[01:45:23.240 --> 01:45:25.080]   screen to approximate a joystick.
[01:45:25.080 --> 01:45:28.320]   I kind of wish they'd just done, since the joysticks themselves were simple, up, down,
[01:45:28.320 --> 01:45:29.320]   left, right sort of things.
[01:45:29.320 --> 01:45:31.320]   It doesn't work with like the eye catered.
[01:45:31.320 --> 01:45:32.320]   It doesn't work with the eye catered.
[01:45:32.320 --> 01:45:37.360]   I actually tried it, but it's a Bluetooth key binding thing, so they could update it to
[01:45:37.360 --> 01:45:38.360]   do that.
[01:45:38.360 --> 01:45:39.360]   That would be really cool.
[01:45:39.360 --> 01:45:42.480]   And Andy, I agree, I, Joust is really, they've got a joystick for Joust, a left-right joystick,
[01:45:42.480 --> 01:45:45.840]   and maybe that's what the original arcade game had, but really it was a left and right
[01:45:45.840 --> 01:45:46.840]   button.
[01:45:46.840 --> 01:45:47.840]   Yeah.
[01:45:47.840 --> 01:45:49.080]   And so they just made a mistake and it doesn't work right.
[01:45:49.080 --> 01:45:50.080]   Right.
[01:45:50.080 --> 01:45:51.080]   Should be a button that you flap the wings.
[01:45:51.080 --> 01:45:52.680]   Yeah, but I'd much rather have a physical clicker.
[01:45:52.680 --> 01:45:53.680]   Yeah.
[01:45:53.680 --> 01:45:54.680]   So it would work.
[01:45:54.680 --> 01:45:58.240]   I was looking forward most to Defender and it's almost like I want to like dip my thumb
[01:45:58.240 --> 01:46:03.440]   in like some sort of like travel oil just so I can get more like action up there.
[01:46:03.440 --> 01:46:04.440]   Oh, well.
[01:46:04.440 --> 01:46:07.880]   Or maybe I've just lost my game since I was 11 years old.
[01:46:07.880 --> 01:46:12.840]   I was quite the champion at the dig dug in at the tapper.
[01:46:12.840 --> 01:46:15.640]   So there is an, you know, Atari did the same thing.
[01:46:15.640 --> 01:46:16.640]   Yeah.
[01:46:16.640 --> 01:46:17.640]   I think it's good that Midway did this.
[01:46:17.640 --> 01:46:18.640]   That's great.
[01:46:18.640 --> 01:46:19.640]   Yeah, it's great.
[01:46:19.640 --> 01:46:25.440]   They just need some either kind of work with the eye catered or or something else or even
[01:46:25.440 --> 01:46:28.480]   with a Bluetooth keyboard or something because you need a physical control for a lot of the
[01:46:28.480 --> 01:46:29.480]   games.
[01:46:29.480 --> 01:46:30.480]   Yeah.
[01:46:30.480 --> 01:46:32.920]   But it's really was cool to play just it is when I take all those all those things that
[01:46:32.920 --> 01:46:35.560]   have been making a lot of money in the last 20 years.
[01:46:35.560 --> 01:46:36.560]   Yeah.
[01:46:36.560 --> 01:46:37.560]   And there's nostalgia.
[01:46:37.560 --> 01:46:39.280]   There's a whole nostalgia thing going on.
[01:46:39.280 --> 01:46:42.480]   It's like 99 cents and you get like seven or eight classic.
[01:46:42.480 --> 01:46:44.520]   I would have paid four dollars for joust.
[01:46:44.520 --> 01:46:45.520]   Yeah.
[01:46:45.520 --> 01:46:47.000]   You know, and it's a great.
[01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:52.600]   It really is like just like, you know, a couple generations ago nostalgia were like the
[01:46:52.600 --> 01:46:55.880]   music that you listened to when you were kidding the fifties and then the next generation
[01:46:55.880 --> 01:46:59.560]   was well, the nostalgia is based on the movies you watch when you're in the sixties and
[01:46:59.560 --> 01:47:01.640]   seventies for our generation.
[01:47:01.640 --> 01:47:02.640]   We're not exactly young.
[01:47:02.640 --> 01:47:06.800]   It's like, no, the arcade games that we used to play in the eighties and even like the home
[01:47:06.800 --> 01:47:09.880]   console games we used to play in the eighties and early nineties.
[01:47:09.880 --> 01:47:10.880]   I was like, oh boy.
[01:47:10.880 --> 01:47:17.480]   I just want to point out I was an adult at the time and and did in fact after my air shift
[01:47:17.480 --> 01:47:22.000]   on the radio show, then a chucky cheese and play battle zone until all out.
[01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.680]   Also because that's the piece that you were paid in quarters.
[01:47:24.680 --> 01:47:27.400]   But it is fun.
[01:47:27.400 --> 01:47:30.720]   It's nice to have a game that you could play without putting quarters in because I still
[01:47:30.720 --> 01:47:33.320]   have this vivid recollection of putting in money.
[01:47:33.320 --> 01:47:35.760]   Well, the app costs for quarters after that.
[01:47:35.760 --> 01:47:36.760]   Oh God.
[01:47:36.760 --> 01:47:37.760]   That's also on top of that.
[01:47:37.760 --> 01:47:41.480]   I like these games where you can get in play for like 50 20 minutes.
[01:47:41.480 --> 01:47:42.480]   They're casual.
[01:47:42.480 --> 01:47:43.480]   They're fun.
[01:47:43.480 --> 01:47:46.200]   You don't have to get invested in storylines and characters and spend three hours figuring
[01:47:46.200 --> 01:47:47.200]   out.
[01:47:47.200 --> 01:47:51.960]   Oh, so to pick up the sword, I jump, jump to the left, jump over, reach down.
[01:47:51.960 --> 01:47:53.720]   Reach back and then reach down again.
[01:47:53.720 --> 01:47:55.240]   And now I have the sword.
[01:47:55.240 --> 01:47:59.720]   If this were 24 for 25 cents in 1986, I would have been killing so many people over the
[01:47:59.720 --> 01:48:03.080]   past three hours instead of figuring out how to pick up the damn weapon.
[01:48:03.080 --> 01:48:05.160]   So my pick is I've been lately.
[01:48:05.160 --> 01:48:08.720]   I don't know why I've been kind of interested in microphones for the iPhone and the iPad.
[01:48:08.720 --> 01:48:12.720]   I've been using audio boo and I wanted to record stuff and Chris Markhart, who does,
[01:48:12.720 --> 01:48:16.680]   you know, great photographer and a photo guy and he does a podcast, turn me on to this.
[01:48:16.680 --> 01:48:18.520]   This is from Studio Projects.
[01:48:18.520 --> 01:48:19.520]   It's not cheap.
[01:48:19.520 --> 01:48:25.640]   The $179 is called the little square mic, but I think you will testify, Alex, to the
[01:48:25.640 --> 01:48:26.640]   way of this.
[01:48:26.640 --> 01:48:27.640]   It's metal.
[01:48:27.640 --> 01:48:28.640]   It's heavy.
[01:48:28.640 --> 01:48:35.280]   It says that they use a 35 millimeter von Braumel und Weber style cardio transist.
[01:48:35.280 --> 01:48:39.920]   So you could see if I tilt it just right, it's a big capsule condenser in here.
[01:48:39.920 --> 01:48:44.560]   It does require a fan and power, but what's interesting is it the couple of things.
[01:48:44.560 --> 01:48:46.320]   First of all, it is a USB mic.
[01:48:46.320 --> 01:48:48.720]   In fact, I just had a curiosity.
[01:48:48.720 --> 01:48:50.800]   I haven't tried it yet on anything.
[01:48:50.800 --> 01:48:55.880]   It just came before the show, but I can try recording to my Amadeus here.
[01:48:55.880 --> 01:49:00.200]   Let's record a little something on this little square mic and see how it sounds.
[01:49:00.200 --> 01:49:01.400]   Let me play it back.
[01:49:01.400 --> 01:49:03.200]   I don't know how it'll sound.
[01:49:03.200 --> 01:49:07.120]   Let's record a little something on this little square mic and see how it sounds.
[01:49:07.120 --> 01:49:08.120]   Sounds good.
[01:49:08.120 --> 01:49:09.120]   Sounds great.
[01:49:09.120 --> 01:49:10.120]   Sounds great.
[01:49:10.120 --> 01:49:13.960]   It's a cardioid, so it means it's directional, so it won't pick up stuff behind the mic.
[01:49:13.960 --> 01:49:16.160]   But here are some of the nice features that are unique.
[01:49:16.160 --> 01:49:20.880]   First of all, it's fairly compact, which is, yeah, we don't have to play anymore of that.
[01:49:20.880 --> 01:49:22.960]   The audio device just died because I unplugged it.
[01:49:22.960 --> 01:49:23.960]   Thank you.
[01:49:23.960 --> 01:49:24.960]   It's fairly compact.
[01:49:24.960 --> 01:49:25.960]   It's flat.
[01:49:25.960 --> 01:49:27.960]   In fact, if you compare it to the iPhone, it's roughly the same size and shape as an
[01:49:27.960 --> 01:49:28.960]   iPhone.
[01:49:28.960 --> 01:49:31.840]   A lot heavier though, because this thing feels like solid steel.
[01:49:31.840 --> 01:49:37.640]   USB, it has a mini USB jack and it comes with a cable, but it also has a mini XLR
[01:49:37.640 --> 01:49:38.640]   jack.
[01:49:38.640 --> 01:49:41.440]   That's one thing that makes it unusual and comes with the cable, which is very nice.
[01:49:41.440 --> 01:49:42.960]   The cables are hard to find.
[01:49:42.960 --> 01:49:49.240]   So it connects us to a regular microphone input on a mixer or whatever it is you're using.
[01:49:49.240 --> 01:49:50.680]   But remember, you'll have to have phantom power.
[01:49:50.680 --> 01:49:52.840]   This does require phantom power.
[01:49:52.840 --> 01:49:58.520]   I like the form factor because you have a threading for a standard mic, so you could
[01:49:58.520 --> 01:50:00.560]   put this on a mic and it would actually look pretty cool.
[01:50:00.560 --> 01:50:02.320]   But you could also just use it as a stand.
[01:50:02.320 --> 01:50:07.040]   In fact, if you tighten it, it'll stand on the table just fine.
[01:50:07.040 --> 01:50:08.040]   That's kind of nice.
[01:50:08.040 --> 01:50:10.320]   You can use this without getting right into it.
[01:50:10.320 --> 01:50:14.560]   So remember way back when Andy figured out that you could use this as a mic input to
[01:50:14.560 --> 01:50:16.160]   the iPhone?
[01:50:16.160 --> 01:50:18.360]   This is the USB camera kit.
[01:50:18.360 --> 01:50:19.360]   No, can you?
[01:50:19.360 --> 01:50:20.520]   Well, I get this.
[01:50:20.520 --> 01:50:24.480]   The accessory is not supported by the iPhone, but I noticed that despite that fact, I can
[01:50:24.480 --> 01:50:25.880]   still use it.
[01:50:25.880 --> 01:50:28.320]   So I think that that's kind of encouraging here.
[01:50:28.320 --> 01:50:30.240]   I'll plug this in the USB.
[01:50:30.240 --> 01:50:32.360]   Often times it's a problem with power.
[01:50:32.360 --> 01:50:36.600]   You might have to plug it into a USB hub before you plug it into the adapter.
[01:50:36.600 --> 01:50:40.520]   Yes, after that, it'll... Some microphones will work without installing the power.
[01:50:40.520 --> 01:50:41.880]   I should try it on the iPad.
[01:50:41.880 --> 01:50:42.880]   Yeah, I should try.
[01:50:42.880 --> 01:50:46.400]   I noticed it is moving the meter, so perhaps it's working.
[01:50:46.400 --> 01:50:47.400]   I don't know.
[01:50:47.400 --> 01:50:48.400]   Scratch it.
[01:50:48.400 --> 01:50:49.400]   Make sure.
[01:50:49.400 --> 01:50:50.400]   I don't know.
[01:50:50.400 --> 01:50:51.400]   No, no, this is it.
[01:50:51.400 --> 01:50:52.400]   Oh, you think it might be the...
[01:50:52.400 --> 01:50:53.400]   Oh, you're right.
[01:50:53.400 --> 01:50:54.400]   It's not.
[01:50:54.400 --> 01:50:55.400]   Okay, so that's good to know.
[01:50:55.400 --> 01:50:57.400]   So this will not work with an iPhone, maybe with the iPad.
[01:50:57.400 --> 01:50:58.400]   Do you have any power?
[01:50:58.400 --> 01:50:59.400]   If I power it?
[01:50:59.400 --> 01:51:00.400]   Do you have any power?
[01:51:00.400 --> 01:51:01.400]   Do you have any power?
[01:51:01.400 --> 01:51:02.400]   Well, there's a powered hub.
[01:51:02.400 --> 01:51:03.400]   There's a whole generation.
[01:51:03.400 --> 01:51:06.120]   I think blue microphones now has a...
[01:51:06.120 --> 01:51:07.120]   They have some power.
[01:51:07.120 --> 01:51:12.200]   They engineered to work with the iPad because, yeah, if you get over a certain amount of
[01:51:12.200 --> 01:51:13.200]   power, it doesn't work.
[01:51:13.200 --> 01:51:14.200]   It's going to drain.
[01:51:14.200 --> 01:51:15.200]   Yeah, that makes sense.
[01:51:15.200 --> 01:51:16.200]   So anyway, that's good.
[01:51:16.200 --> 01:51:18.320]   I'm glad we tried that fresh on the ear.
[01:51:18.320 --> 01:51:19.320]   Don't use this with the iPad.
[01:51:19.320 --> 01:51:20.320]   It sounds great.
[01:51:20.320 --> 01:51:21.320]   It sounds great.
[01:51:21.320 --> 01:51:24.640]   But the sound quality was very nice, and I think this is going to be my...
[01:51:24.640 --> 01:51:25.640]   It's going to be my...
[01:51:25.640 --> 01:51:30.600]   Carry this around with me as I travel so that I can record commercials and stuff.
[01:51:30.600 --> 01:51:33.560]   As soon as we finish the show, I'm going to steal it from Leo and take it into the lab
[01:51:33.560 --> 01:51:34.560]   for about 15 minutes.
[01:51:34.560 --> 01:51:35.560]   It is not cheap.
[01:51:35.560 --> 01:51:37.560]   It is $179 on Amazon.
[01:51:37.560 --> 01:51:38.880]   It does come in four colors.
[01:51:38.880 --> 01:51:43.720]   So if you've been looking for somewhere to buy a pink microphone, ladies, your search
[01:51:43.720 --> 01:51:45.200]   is over.
[01:51:45.200 --> 01:51:48.080]   The little square mic.
[01:51:48.080 --> 01:51:49.280]   Some guys like pink microphones.
[01:51:49.280 --> 01:51:50.520]   Notice I bought red.
[01:51:50.520 --> 01:51:52.840]   I just thought that looked kind of nice and different.
[01:51:52.840 --> 01:51:55.080]   They do have black and white as well.
[01:51:55.080 --> 01:51:59.200]   It is from a company called Studio Projects.
[01:51:59.200 --> 01:52:00.840]   As I said, also available on Amazon.
[01:52:00.840 --> 01:52:03.000]   The sound quality does seem quite good.
[01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:04.000]   Chris was using it.
[01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:08.240]   He's even very close to his mouth and getting pretty good results on it.
[01:52:08.240 --> 01:52:10.320]   So we shall play more with that.
[01:52:10.320 --> 01:52:12.280]   We've also played with the Apogee mic.
[01:52:12.280 --> 01:52:15.400]   I like the quality a lot on the Apogee mic, but that was USB only.
[01:52:15.400 --> 01:52:18.400]   It didn't have this additional feature of having an XLR.
[01:52:18.400 --> 01:52:21.520]   The one we've been looking at is the Yeti, because the Yeti has an XLR.
[01:52:21.520 --> 01:52:22.520]   The Yeti Pro.
[01:52:22.520 --> 01:52:23.520]   It is so good.
[01:52:23.520 --> 01:52:24.520]   But it was really big.
[01:52:24.520 --> 01:52:25.880]   It just has really high quality.
[01:52:25.880 --> 01:52:26.960]   I've been looking for something smaller.
[01:52:26.960 --> 01:52:28.200]   That's why I was so excited when I brought that in.
[01:52:28.200 --> 01:52:31.200]   I was literally about to buy a bushel of them.
[01:52:31.200 --> 01:52:32.200]   It's my guess that this is...
[01:52:32.200 --> 01:52:33.200]   I'll tell you what here.
[01:52:33.200 --> 01:52:34.880]   Go test it and let us know.
[01:52:34.880 --> 01:52:39.480]   But just from that little bit, I'll tell you what, I will do more, some more recording
[01:52:39.480 --> 01:52:41.480]   on it and post those on my blog.
[01:52:41.480 --> 01:52:42.480]   People can listen.
[01:52:42.480 --> 01:52:43.480]   That's what I've been doing with the mic.
[01:52:43.480 --> 01:52:45.480]   You can do it side by side with the Yeti.
[01:52:45.480 --> 01:52:46.480]   I would love to do that.
[01:52:46.480 --> 01:52:47.480]   I have that in the other room.
[01:52:47.480 --> 01:52:48.480]   I would love to do that.
[01:52:48.480 --> 01:52:49.880]   I like what our picks say about us.
[01:52:49.880 --> 01:52:54.880]   I as a writer chose a writing system and Alex is an image guy, took a Photoshop.
[01:52:54.880 --> 01:52:56.720]   Leo's got a microphone and then of course Andy.
[01:52:56.720 --> 01:52:57.720]   He's a gamer.
[01:52:57.720 --> 01:52:59.920]   Has an 80s video game now.
[01:52:59.920 --> 01:53:09.160]   Actually, that's me being writing about 11,000 words between 7pm but between yesterday and
[01:53:09.160 --> 01:53:10.160]   today.
[01:53:10.160 --> 01:53:12.400]   And then realizing I take this and say, "Oh wait, I haven't selected a pick yet.
[01:53:12.400 --> 01:53:13.400]   Oh damn it.
[01:53:13.400 --> 01:53:14.400]   What's on my iPad right now that I have?"
[01:53:14.400 --> 01:53:15.400]   Oh wait, I do love that.
[01:53:15.400 --> 01:53:16.400]   Okay, that's good.
[01:53:16.400 --> 01:53:17.400]   That'll work.
[01:53:17.400 --> 01:53:18.400]   Yeah.
[01:53:18.400 --> 01:53:19.720]   We liked the Apigee quite a bit.
[01:53:19.720 --> 01:53:21.280]   It was a good looking mic.
[01:53:21.280 --> 01:53:22.360]   It felt solid.
[01:53:22.360 --> 01:53:25.200]   This is a little more compact and has a little more flexibility.
[01:53:25.200 --> 01:53:29.800]   What it doesn't have is the volume control on the side, which the Apigee had.
[01:53:29.800 --> 01:53:33.840]   But that made me nervous because I was afraid that it would get accidentally tapped.
[01:53:33.840 --> 01:53:34.840]   Yeah, it looks great.
[01:53:34.840 --> 01:53:39.920]   I would rather control the volume at the recording unit than in the microphone.
[01:53:39.920 --> 01:53:44.160]   Neither of these have the one thing that you really want, which is a tap so you can listen
[01:53:44.160 --> 01:53:46.160]   directly instead of having to listen to it.
[01:53:46.160 --> 01:53:47.160]   Zero latency.
[01:53:47.160 --> 01:53:48.160]   Yeah, zero latency tap.
[01:53:48.160 --> 01:53:49.840]   And I don't know why they don't put that on these.
[01:53:49.840 --> 01:53:52.120]   That would really be very handy.
[01:53:52.120 --> 01:53:54.000]   Hey, we have run out of time.
[01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:59.320]   Apple is up $9.65 today to $5.35.41.
[01:53:59.320 --> 01:54:04.380]   I'm guessing that has something to do with that invitation, which is bizarre because everybody's
[01:54:04.380 --> 01:54:06.920]   known that they were going to do an iPad 3.
[01:54:06.920 --> 01:54:08.520]   But the market, I guess, was just waiting.
[01:54:08.520 --> 01:54:13.080]   So the other shoe dropped $9 up $10 to $5.35.41.
[01:54:13.080 --> 01:54:14.080]   Because of us?
[01:54:14.080 --> 01:54:15.080]   Yes.
[01:54:15.080 --> 01:54:16.080]   Because of us.
[01:54:16.080 --> 01:54:17.080]   They were listening.
[01:54:17.080 --> 01:54:18.640]   We're up during our show.
[01:54:18.640 --> 01:54:19.720]   Thanks everybody for being here.
[01:54:19.720 --> 01:54:21.600]   We do Mac break weekly.
[01:54:21.600 --> 01:54:25.160]   Every Tuesday at 11 a.m. Pacific 2 p.m. Eastern time on Twit.tv.
[01:54:25.160 --> 01:54:26.800]   That's 1900 UTC.
[01:54:26.800 --> 01:54:31.360]   Over next week, we'll be doing it at a different time because we'll be covering live the iPad
[01:54:31.360 --> 01:54:32.640]   3 announcement.
[01:54:32.640 --> 01:54:39.360]   And that'll be starting at 9.30 a.m. Pacific 12.30 eastern time on Twit.tv on Wednesday,
[01:54:39.360 --> 01:54:40.360]   March 7.
[01:54:40.360 --> 01:54:41.560]   So we'll see you then.
[01:54:41.560 --> 01:54:42.840]   That should be pretty darn exciting.
[01:54:42.840 --> 01:54:45.080]   And Jason and baby Andy will be there.
[01:54:45.080 --> 01:54:49.920]   And if so, we will make sure that they give us their hands-on impressions of the new iPad
[01:54:49.920 --> 01:54:50.920]   3.
[01:54:50.920 --> 01:54:51.920]   Thanks everybody for joining us now.
[01:54:51.920 --> 01:54:52.920]   Get back to work.
[01:54:52.920 --> 01:54:53.920]   Break time is over.
[01:54:53.920 --> 01:55:03.920]   [MUSIC]
