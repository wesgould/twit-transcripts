[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.960]   We're going to be talking a little bit more about
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.840]   WWDC, a little bit about Craig Federiki,
[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.240]   and Phil Schiller on Talk Show,
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.240]   and quite a lot about iPhone 7.

[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.040]   where we talk about everything that has happened in Apple
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.720]   this week, any week, every week as a matter of fact.
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.800]   Leo Laport is-- I think he's on vacation,
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.520]   but I'm going to say he's on special assignment
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.840]   because that's probably what he's really doing.
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.760]   But we've gotten the rest of the gang together for you
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.200]   and that includes the inimitable Andy Inaco
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.480]   from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.040]   How are you doing, Andy?
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.240]   When I found out-- and when Alex and I found out
[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.920]   that you were hosting and Leo was going,
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.800]   we decided to create our own secessionist show movement.
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.080]   Yeah, don't think of this as a show.
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.920]   Think of it as a coup.
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:12.840]   Exactly.
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.840]   That is the Pixel Core's own Alex Lizzie.
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.920]   When it has two people, your window has one.
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.800]   Now, how do I know you're doing it together?
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.000]   Because your green skills are so top-notch.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.480]   You could actually just be sliding into Andy's studio.
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.160]   Well, you will notice that we don't actually cross over here.
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.360]   Now, we have been really working on some of the key.
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.360]   So now, this is the hardest part right there.
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.960]   That's a one key over top of the other one.
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.280]   Yeah, I'll agree with that digitally.
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.120]   Are you cutting film?
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.320]   It's mostly cutting film.
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.560]   There's actually guys back there like,
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.000]   "Sneeping, snip, snip, snip, snip, snip."
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.840]   So Andy, you just crashed the studio with your Coke
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.800]   and your smile?
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.920]   See, Alex, I was in-- I'm in DC for an A Samsung internet
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.880]   of things summit involving politicians and people
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.360]   from the Department of Transportation
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.200]   and people from Samsung and people from Verizon.
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.240]   And I thought that I could get to free Coke
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.640]   if I stopped by the Alts' plates.
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.280]   I should mention that Alex was nice enough to actually
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.560]   lay in a supply of Mexican Coke.
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.560]   And they did not last until lunchtime.
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.160]   I drank one as soon as I arrived.
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.160]   I just 90 degrees.
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.440]   And then I drank a second one.
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:22.800]   And then that was it.
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:23.800]   Now I'm not--
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:24.320]   I'm not--
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.880]   This is their last can of Coke.
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.480]   I'm laying claim to it.
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.560]   What are you saying is that Alex put on the Ironman armor,
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.200]   went to Mexico, picked up as many Coke
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.320]   as he could carry, and then flew back before the show?
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.440]   It was the only way you could get there in time.
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.760]   That was what had to happen.
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.840]   So since we last met-- we talked about the WWDC keynote.
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.040]   But--
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.600]   Guides at the same adventure safari zone.
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.960]   You do like the large primates exhibits.
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.960]   I do like the reptile exhibits.
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.680]   I was thinking Jurassic Park Lego.
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.680]   But I wasn't sure how far off I was.
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.640]   So since last we met, the WWDC keynote obviously,
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:00.600]   we talked about that already.
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.360]   But the entire week continued on.
[00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.720]   Starting the Tuesday night right after the show,
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.760]   Mr. John Gruber of Daring Fireball Fame
[00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.440]   had Craig Federicki and Phil Schiller on the talk show live.
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.440]   I managed to watch the show, but it's available on video now.
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.840]   We have a transcript of it as well.
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.360]   And I thought-- and I don't know what your opinion was,
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:19.760]   but I thought it was a really good show.
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.440]   And Craig Federicki in particular was incredibly candid,
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.640]   not just about what they did, but how they did it.
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:26.880]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.040]   And this is, of course, credit to John,
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.960]   because he creates an environment where they--
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.840]   where those guys feel very, very safe.
[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.360]   They feel as though they can talk openly
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.600]   and know that there isn't going to be a gotcha right
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.200]   in the after.
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.640]   They're not going to say, well, then why didn't you fix it?
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.800]   John is-- John is-- they know that John is not a bozo.
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.120]   And also that he understands the process by which large systems
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.120]   get built.
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.480]   And so that's one of the many great things
[00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.880]   that John does for the entire Mac and iOS community now
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.040]   is to have these little--
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.200]   there's no clicker in your hands, guys.
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.640]   The snipers have been cleared away from the towers.
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.880]   You can speak for some eye openly.
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.840]   But yeah, it's probably-- it's really the only time every year
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.400]   that I can sort of count on that level of freedom
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.960]   and candor from anyone at Apple.
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.240]   And Alex, to me, one of the most interesting parts
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.480]   is they basically explained how they made watch OS faster.
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.360]   And they did it because basically by throwing DRAM at the problem,
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.320]   they had a little bit of RAM overhead, a little bit of extra power
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.440]   because they figured battery life was enough.
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.080]   And they just threw apps into resident memory.
[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.040]   Is that a real fix for you?
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.040]   Well, I mean, I think that in a lot of ways,
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.960]   I think a lot of times when we see the release, the version,
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.320]   the one being released, they know that there's
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.240]   optimizations that can be done, but they had to ship.
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.720]   So I think that-- I don't think it's necessarily
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.680]   that they are-- I think that they knew
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.200]   that that was a solution that was probably coming down the path
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.360]   and that they just wasn't ready for when they actually
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:53.320]   had to release the watch.
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:57.120]   So I think that I'm looking forward to continuing
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.720]   to see how they progress the watch.
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.400]   Obviously, I think it was a pretty big upgrade
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.040]   as far as the feature sets that we're starting to see.
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.400]   And they had alluded to the fact that they were at a certain stage
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.120]   when they released it.
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:12.760]   And there was obviously a long development curve there.
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.800]   So I think I'm excited to see the features that they released
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.040]   here as well as whatever comes out in the fall.
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.800]   Does it mean, Andy, can we actually go--
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.640]   do we still need new hardware in the fall?
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.400]   Or is this enough that they could maybe buffer into March
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:26.800]   if they wanted to?
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.320]   I think they're going to create a--
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:29.720]   I think there are very few reasons
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:33.360]   to demand that someone buy a new watch in the fall.
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.480]   I did install the WatchOS beta.
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.880]   It's plenty sprightly to me.
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.920]   I know that we've been talking in the past couple of weeks
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.800]   about how I would--
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.960]   I keep every developer beta device in a man-aise jar
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.600]   in a separate yard to make sure it doesn't affect
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:50.640]   my actual production stuff.
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:53.320]   But actually, it improves the experience of Apple Watch,
[00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.600]   even my first generation hardware, well enough
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:59.600]   that I would like to wear this all the time.
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.600]   So yeah, I don't think they're going to need new hardware.
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:02.960]   It was very, very clear that--
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.200]   I felt as though-- and some conversations I've
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:06.960]   had have sort of buttressed this--
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.120]   was that Apple was being very, very conservative
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:13.000]   about what the first generation of the OS could do.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.080]   I think they still left themselves a lot of headroom
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:18.560]   for future expansion because they spent so much time
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.960]   trying to get that first generation hardware correct.
[00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:23.640]   And also, I think they believe that they
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:26.400]   have to spend a couple of years watching
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:29.440]   how people are using this and watching what hardware
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.160]   features developers want.
[00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.040]   And we're not so much talking about cameras
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:35.040]   as much as should we put more storage in there
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.920]   or should we put more active RAM?
[00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:39.280]   Is the RAM we've got in there right now fast enough?
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:40.120]   Or is it OK?
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:41.360]   Can we cut some corners here?
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.600]   And it really does take them a couple of years
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.280]   to figure out what the second generation is going to be.
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:48.920]   If they just slapped a camera or extra RAM
[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:52.800]   in a new version for 2016, it would be nice.
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.320]   But it really wouldn't be worth it.
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:56.640]   If all the things that they can put their engineers on,
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:58.640]   that's not going to be as good a bang for the buck
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:02.720]   as Apple Watch 2 after two years of observing people
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.080]   using this thing.
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:06.440]   Yeah, we didn't have a chance to talk to you last week, Alex.
[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:08.560]   But they did things like they did flatten the interface
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:08.840]   a lot.
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:10.680]   Glances are now part of the apps.
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.200]   The Friends Hub has gone away.
[00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.720]   It's now buried in messages.
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:16.520]   The carousel is still there, but they didn't even show it off.
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:19.360]   They brought Sprite Kit and Seeing Kit to the watch.
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:20.880]   In-line videos.
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:23.640]   Is that exciting to you just from the production standpoint?
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:25.160]   I think a lot of this stuff looks good.
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.480]   I mean, I think fundamentally that they don't have to do very
[00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:27.760]   much.
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:31.280]   I'm very attached to my watch at this point, my high watch.
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:33.080]   So there's not a lot that they have to lift.
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.920]   I mean, the fact that I see my Slack and my SMS
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:38.960]   and I'm able to run little timers and stuff like that
[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:41.440]   is enough to keep it on my wrist.
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.360]   The thing that I want more than anything else--
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.880]   and mine is a very geeky need, which is that I just
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:47.680]   want to be able to design my own watch faces
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:49.400]   from a production perspective.
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:53.640]   I get that they can put more of the--
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.920]   they can add more features to what's there.
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:58.320]   But what I want to do is design what I want on my watch.
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.240]   I want to be able to have a layout tool that lets me
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:04.120]   lay out where I want everything.
[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:07.080]   And specifically for me, I just want a digital watch
[00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.080]   with seconds.
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.080]   Yeah.
[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:12.080]   Like, I probably-- the whole thing would go away if they just
[00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:13.960]   gave me a digital watch with seconds.
[00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:16.160]   I will never use the--
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.680]   the Deathly phrase, what Apple should be doing,
[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:20.000]   or Apple what should have done.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.280]   I would say that if I were in charge of the team,
[00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:24.800]   I would say that the very first instant we
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:28.120]   can have some sort of an API for creating third party custom
[00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:29.360]   watch faces.
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:34.040]   That every other feature, every other thing that's on the list
[00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:35.120]   is secondary to that.
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.080]   I mean, it is a watch.
[00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:36.760]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:43.560]   I've got-- honestly, I've got my Moto Android Wear watch
[00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:45.480]   charging over there on the table.
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:49.840]   But really, as good as all the features of that watch are,
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.680]   I think that 40% of why I love it
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:54.840]   is that I can have a little cartoon rocket ship second hand
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:57.320]   going over a little cartoon planet if I want.
[00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:00.720]   And then when someone comes up with a really hugely functional
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.840]   watch face that has--
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:05.720]   that's, I think, is genuinely beautiful and has my taste.
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:07.440]   I can put that on instead.
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:12.360]   And failing that, I just think that Apple hasn't stood up.
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:14.600]   Apple, I don't think, has stepped up to the problem of,
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.440]   if we're not going to let people create through our watch
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:20.640]   faces, we have to create something really beautiful that's
[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:23.440]   as beautiful designed as a digital watch face
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:26.640]   as the Apple watches as a physical object piece of jewelry.
[00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:29.000]   And I have to admit, this is one of those ones where--
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.640]   a lot of times when Apple does something, I go, well,
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:32.960]   I might not agree with it, but I understand
[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:34.080]   why they're doing X, Y, and Z.
[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:36.560]   And with this one, I don't understand.
[00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:37.920]   And I don't understand why we can't
[00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:38.800]   build our own watch faces.
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:41.560]   I mean, I guess it was a little bit like when we got an iPhone
[00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:43.560]   and we were like, I don't understand why I can't add apps.
[00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:45.280]   And we got an Apple TV--
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:47.840]   There was no wallpaper until I think iOS 4, right?
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:48.760]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:51.720]   But it was just like, I don't understand why we can't add apps.
[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.840]   And for both the Apple TV and I get
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:56.800]   that they're-- I'm sure that they have something up their sleeve,
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.800]   but I just wish that they would pull it out faster.
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:00.680]   It's like Apple has come home--
[00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:03.160]   our daughter, Apple, has come home from the first year
[00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:06.320]   of college and has announced that she is dropping her major
[00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:08.520]   of business and going into ceramics.
[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:11.600]   Like, that's not the choice I would have made for you, honey.
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.040]   I hope you know which--
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:14.320]   I have faith in you.
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:15.640]   I hope you know what you're doing.
[00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:18.760]   I see some flaws in this, but I'm not living your life for you.
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:19.480]   Right.
[00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.400]   So that one I don't understand, but hopefully something
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:23.080]   that's what I can do that.
[00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:24.160]   One of the other things we learned
[00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.320]   is how the auto unlock feature works.
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:29.120]   And that is the Apple Watch has to be within three meters.
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:30.120]   It uses time of flight.
[00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:32.560]   So it actually measures a length of time it takes the signal
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:34.640]   to go from the watch to the computer.
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:36.560]   And that's to stop something like a relay attack.
[00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:39.160]   So if Andy was sitting in between Alex and his computer,
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.680]   he couldn't pick up the signal and then beam it to the computer
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:43.480]   and try to unlock it on his own.
[00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:45.840]   But it also requires two-factor authentication,
[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:47.320]   which Apple debuted last year.
[00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:49.480]   It's been rolling out ever since.
[00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:51.320]   And Andy, that's a level of complexity
[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:53.840]   that not everybody is still comfortable with.
[00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:54.200]   Yeah.
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:55.440]   I mean, it just has to work.
[00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:58.320]   And it also really points to how this is deeply embedded
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:01.240]   in Apple's philosophy, because the situations in which someone
[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:03.920]   would be able to use that technology and abuse it to unlock
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:06.640]   a Mac, the way that I've heard it described,
[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:09.320]   it makes me think that, well, I am sitting right in front
[00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:10.800]   of Alex's computer.
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.760]   Game is already over.
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:15.720]   All I have all I has to do is step out for about 10 or 15 seconds
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:16.440]   to take a phone call.
[00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:18.960]   And I can do a variety of damage by simply getting access
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:20.120]   to his USB port.
[00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:23.200]   And if he's leaving for an hour, again, volume over,
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.600]   I can get everything.
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:28.000]   But I think it's more vindication of how seriously Apple treats
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.040]   everything, that if there is any way to make this more secure,
[00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:36.320]   make it more safe to take that 1 in 1,000 chance
[00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:39.080]   and turn to 1 in 10,000 chances, something bad will happen
[00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:41.240]   when it comes to security, they're going to do it.
[00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:42.840]   I do think that, though, if they-- I
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:44.480]   haven't played with that feature myself.
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:47.600]   But I think that if it doesn't-- all it has to do
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:51.040]   is not work two out of five times.
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:53.160]   And the user is not going to try to use it a six time.
[00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:56.040]   They will turn it off intending to go back and fix it later.
[00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:59.000]   But then they will never go back and turn it back on again.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.400]   And there is some feeling that, like Touch ID,
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:02.720]   it will enable-- because right now we
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:03.760]   type in our passwords all the time.
[00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:05.640]   You open up the lead type in your password.
[00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:07.680]   Almost everybody has a password, I think,
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:09.520]   enabled for their Mac at this point.
[00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:10.920]   But with this technology, you'll only
[00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:13.240]   have to enter the password when the computer reboots.
[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:15.320]   So if it's just asleep, you can open the lid.
[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:18.000]   And if your watch is within proximity,
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.680]   it will just open and work.
[00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:21.520]   And the feeling is that, just like Touch ID,
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:23.680]   it might let people actually increase the complexity
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:26.920]   of their password because they won't have to enter it so often.
[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:29.160]   So it also increases their chance of forgetting it.
[00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:29.720]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:32.120]   So if it's a complex one and they don't have it stored somewhere,
[00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:35.160]   you know, I think that--
[00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.400]   now that I've gotten used to the Touch ID,
[00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.800]   I have to keep on remembering what my password is.
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:42.200]   It's because it's somewhat complex.
[00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:46.480]   But B, I think that I find when I have to put a passcode in,
[00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:49.760]   I'm now very conscious to how unsecure that is.
[00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:53.120]   Like, when I'm on a plane, when I'm in front of my kids,
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:55.280]   when I'm in front of-- you know, like all of those things,
[00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:58.400]   you really want to be able to drop to not half.
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:00.480]   That's why Snowden put a blanket over his whole body
[00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:01.560]   when he put his in.
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:03.440]   Yeah, there's so many subtle things about this.
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:06.920]   I hit this-- I wrote Amtrak for eight hours down here.
[00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:08.960]   And so I wanted to log into my Plex server
[00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:10.440]   to get access to my movies.
[00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:12.400]   And I recently changed it, forgot--
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:14.040]   I took the wrong guess as to what it was.
[00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:16.080]   So OK, well, I'll go into one password
[00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:17.920]   and just pull it back up again.
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:21.000]   And the last time I used one password on my iPad,
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.480]   it was to get to copy up my MasterCard number.
[00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:29.920]   And so one password gives you that blank screen with that one.
[00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:30.960]   What is your MasterCard?
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:32.280]   OK, it's bo-bo-bo-bo-bo.
[00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:34.400]   Unlock it, and suddenly my screen is filled with,
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:37.080]   here's your MasterCard number ending
[00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:39.880]   in whoever's sitting right next to you in big letters.
[00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:42.760]   And so that's when I would-- as the developer of that app,
[00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:44.400]   I would say, "Note to self.
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:47.800]   Make sure that it has not been accessed in five minutes.
[00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:50.080]   Then make sure you take the user to a blank page.
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:51.480]   That's just a list of weeks.
[00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:53.320]   So that's the sort of stuff we're talking about.
[00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:56.160]   There's so many subtle things about passwords
[00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:59.920]   that make perfect logical sense.
[00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:01.280]   But then when you put it out in the field,
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:02.880]   you find that you kind of--
[00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:05.960]   by not thinking about the 1 million instance,
[00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:07.480]   you've kind of borked things.
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:09.000]   I didn't notice as an aside that when you--
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.640]   I use private browsing almost all the time,
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:12.720]   just the same way I use it on the desktop.
[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:14.920]   And I noticed that now when you transition back and forth
[00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:16.560]   between private browsing and other apps,
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:19.320]   it blanks the browser content every time you go to and from it
[00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:21.360]   so you can't actually see it until you're in there.
[00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:23.080]   And that-- I didn't think it made sense
[00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:24.160]   because I'm the one looking at it,
[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:27.400]   but then I realized there could be a bunch of people around me.
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:30.120]   Yeah, but there's a lot of things that have been tweaked
[00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:31.480]   and still need to be tweaked.
[00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:36.560]   It still annoys me that I think that the Safari browser purges
[00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:39.960]   content for memory purposes a lot more frequently
[00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:42.360]   that I think it has to or than it should.
[00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:43.560]   It's tantalized.
[00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:47.000]   I wish that it would at least blank the screen before--
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.240]   when I want to switch back into Safari,
[00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:51.280]   blank the screen first, then switch into it
[00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:52.760]   because I've done things--
[00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:55.840]   so many times I've had the screen that has,
[00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:58.120]   here's the MBTA Cumular Rail Schedule.
[00:15:58.120 --> 00:15:59.240]   And it's already there.
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:01.120]   And I left it on that page.
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:04.080]   And then I went over to another app just to check something,
[00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:05.160]   went back in.
[00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:09.840]   And then I see in Safari, I see for 2.1 seconds
[00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:12.480]   that screen before it tries to refresh itself.
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:15.680]   And because I'm in airplane mode, I lose it completely.
[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:17.840]   Or you hit the ad because it didn't push it down the page
[00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:19.440]   fast enough for your finger.
[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:21.240]   That's just to be all the time.
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:24.720]   It's still kind of-- and this is not exclusive to Apple.
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:26.680]   This is also true of all my Android devices.
[00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:30.760]   I'm still reflexively screenshotting anything
[00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:33.960]   that's important because I might not be able to--
[00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:34.800]   40 passes.
[00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:35.160]   Exactly.
[00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:36.600]   It's like 40 passes.
[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:38.520]   You're always like-- I'm always--
[00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:40.400]   I'll open up the United app and it's like reloading.
[00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:41.640]   I'm like, what?
[00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:44.080]   So yeah, no, I-- and what's funny is, of course,
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:47.440]   my phone is tied to my Apple TV at home.
[00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:48.600]   And so my kids love it.
[00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:49.440]   I turned it off.
[00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:50.760]   And then they complained because they
[00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:53.680]   love the fact that they can see when it's
[00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:56.840]   on a screen share or screen saver mode,
[00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:59.120]   that they can just see what I've been shooting pictures of.
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:02.600]   And so they really enjoy it.
[00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:05.680]   But then there's the odd photos of business cards
[00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:08.360]   and some floating across and screen pictures of my pouring
[00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:09.160]   pass and--
[00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:09.640]   Yeah.
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:10.640]   --you know, I have to have a thing.
[00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:12.920]   I'm in the habit of taking pictures of receipts
[00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:14.080]   and stuff like that.
[00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:16.640]   And I'll set up a new device that's like, oh,
[00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:19.960]   I really didn't want people to see how much I paid for it
[00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:21.360]   to get the new transmission put in.
[00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:21.840]   OK.
[00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:23.080]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:25.240]   There was an interesting sort of--
[00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:26.600]   I don't know what the right word for it
[00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:28.440]   was at a shoulder check during the event, too,
[00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:30.960]   when they started explaining how Apple is doing deep learning
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:33.160]   and how they're doing computer vision.
[00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:34.560]   And it was a funny joke.
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:36.960]   But I think it goes to the philosophy of the two companies
[00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:39.040]   where they were talking about privacy
[00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:41.040]   and they were talking about, could you do this deep learning?
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:43.560]   And could you do this computer vision without sucking up
[00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:45.800]   everybody's content to the server first?
[00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:48.280]   And Federicky said, it turns out that we can figure out
[00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:49.800]   what a mountain looks like without having
[00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:50.960]   to take your photos.
[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:53.440]   The detectives of Apple can just go around and figure out,
[00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:54.680]   this is a mountain.
[00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:56.720]   And they did announce an impressive amount.
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:59.440]   I don't know exactly how it compares to what Google can do,
[00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:01.480]   but there's thousands of objects and hundreds
[00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:03.440]   and hundreds of different categories.
[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:05.960]   I don't know if you checked how many it was, Andy,
[00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:08.440]   but it doesn't seem as much as what Google can do,
[00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:10.040]   but it seems more than what I expected
[00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:12.560]   given the constraints Apple imposed on themselves.
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:15.520]   Yeah, and it's totally unfair to have any expectation
[00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:19.600]   that if any deep learning a feature that Apple does
[00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:22.120]   has to be as good as Google's right outside the board,
[00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:25.080]   just as it was wrong to think that the first version of Apple
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:26.560]   Maps is going to be as good as Google Maps,
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:28.560]   because they have been working on this.
[00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:30.880]   And this has been a core technology of theirs for years.
[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:34.200]   And it became a tent pole feature of all their products
[00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:37.240]   just last year where they want to make sure they put that phrase
[00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:38.360]   into play.
[00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:42.480]   But they do have a-- they got a big challenge ahead of them.
[00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:45.680]   It really is not--
[00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:48.800]   I think that you can't be a responsible commentator
[00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:52.960]   without noticing that the entire demo of photos
[00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:56.480]   tracks step by step by step with features of Google photos.
[00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:58.400]   So that doesn't-- again, that's not a problem,
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:00.520]   because Google Photos has a lot of features
[00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:02.560]   that I would like to be able to access everywhere.
[00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:05.720]   But it means that that gives people the opportunity to save--
[00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:07.640]   especially if your spouse has an Android device
[00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:11.160]   and you've got an iOS device-- to say, OK, thank you.
[00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:12.800]   Thank you, Apple Photos.
[00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:17.560]   That is indeed the pointy thing in front of the big blue thing
[00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:19.800]   with a big yellow round thing on top of it
[00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:23.840]   is indeed a mountain and a sky, whereas the Google app is
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:25.800]   saying, well, that's Mount Shasta.
[00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:27.120]   I know where Mount Shasta is.
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:28.360]   I know where the track of the sun is.
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:33.480]   That was clearly taken at 1.22 PM on this day of the week.
[00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:39.160]   And by the way, the things that Google can identify and actually
[00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:41.760]   help you out with are really fine-grained.
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:44.480]   And so I think that it's a good idea for Apple
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:47.920]   to coast a little bit and say, isn't it nice we're giving you
[00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:48.840]   these features?
[00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:50.680]   We'll start bragging about it in a couple of years
[00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:52.640]   when we get to see and analyze a lot more photos
[00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:54.600]   than we're seeing and analyzing right now,
[00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:59.000]   because they're on a Pogo stick and someone else
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.720]   has been making F1 cars since 1973.
[00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:05.800]   So direct comparisons are probably not very helpful.
[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:07.640]   Well, I think also there's a different agreement
[00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:09.080]   that Apple has with its users and Google
[00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:11.640]   has with its users that allows Google to iterate much faster
[00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:12.600]   than Apple.
[00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:15.200]   And I think that Apple users or Apple
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:17.520]   has decided that their users care more about privacy
[00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:22.600]   than ease of use or necessarily robustness.
[00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:25.040]   But I think that those different agreements definitely
[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:26.880]   gives Google a strong advantage.
[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:31.480]   Yeah, every hour of every show we do,
[00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:34.840]   as Renee alternates saying that isn't a great that we have
[00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:36.720]   choice and that I agree with him or I say it
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:39.840]   and the Renee agrees with me, it's great that we have that choice.
[00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:42.960]   If you feel comfortable with the way that Google does business
[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:45.120]   and there's no reason why you necessarily shouldn't,
[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:48.200]   it's a personal choice, there's so much more
[00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:52.240]   you can do with that technology if you allow
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.960]   that entity to have more access.
[00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:55.600]   However, for a lot of Apple users,
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:57.520]   it is an actual feature that not only--
[00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:59.880]   it's not just protecting my data from Apple,
[00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:02.200]   I'm protecting my data from anybody who might want
[00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:03.520]   to have access to Apple.
[00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:05.880]   And so they're willing to say mountain,
[00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:08.200]   as opposed to Mount Shasta, 122P.
[00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.840]   They'll really give that up if it means
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:10.920]   that they get something in return.
[00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:14.080]   So each one, there's a contract, there's a deal that is made,
[00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:15.920]   it is beneficial to both parties and you
[00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:18.640]   have the choice of A or B.
[00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:20.160]   Yeah, I think it's one of those things
[00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:21.720]   we've talked about this before where
[00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:24.200]   I just want people to be aware of the cost of these things.
[00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.800]   For example, when you're paying with money,
[00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:27.200]   you see it come out of your bank account.
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:29.640]   When you're paying with time, if you're installing patent-free
[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:32.160]   Linux, you can see the clock go tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.
[00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:34.320]   But when you pay with data, you don't see that data floating
[00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:35.040]   up into the cloud.
[00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:37.240]   So some people believe it's effectively free.
[00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:38.400]   And for the most part, it is.
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:40.200]   But then you once in a while have this thing,
[00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:42.360]   like an Edward Snowden who comes out and says, oh, by the way,
[00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:46.360]   the NSA is also monitoring their ex-significant others
[00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:47.800]   and going through all your photos.
[00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:49.960]   And then you kind of wish they didn't have access to that stuff.
[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:51.760]   So I think the balance is really important.
[00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:55.400]   It's a really broad canvas with a lot of variables involved
[00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:56.240]   in it.
[00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:57.840]   But one of the things that I think
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:02.800]   into the conversation is that so you don't trust Google
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:05.080]   for reasons that are perfectly reasonable,
[00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:08.680]   but realize that you're going to be using the web
[00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:11.720]   and people who are entities that are far, far more liberal
[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:15.000]   and more aggressive than Google is trying to get at your data,
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.600]   even the fact that you are using-- if you're getting discounts
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:20.680]   at your grocery store, that data is being leaked out.
[00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:24.280]   And so it really is such a big world that you have to deal with.
[00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:28.400]   And you have to understand where your data is leaking out.
[00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:31.240]   Again, I feel like I'm making good transaction with Google
[00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:32.600]   for that reason.
[00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:34.000]   And at some point, you really just
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.160]   have to say this is the world that we live in,
[00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:37.160]   and we have to live in it.
[00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:39.440]   And I have to admit that I think you either
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:43.760]   have to put on a foil hat or realize that a lot of that data.
[00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:45.440]   Because the data is--
[00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:50.360]   I was talking to somebody that works in IT for a large grocery
[00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:51.120]   store.
[00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:52.680]   And I mentioned the fact that I always
[00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:57.120]   use my parents in law their phone number.
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:59.520]   And I tend to just use that all the time.
[00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:02.280]   And so it's not mine.
[00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:03.520]   And he looked at me and he's like,
[00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:04.880]   that doesn't matter at all.
[00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:08.280]   As soon as you use your credit card with that number,
[00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:09.440]   you're connected.
[00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:13.520]   It's like it's like it's much more insidious than you--
[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:15.120]   one time is all it took.
[00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:17.680]   And then after that, they're just tracking the whole thing.
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:19.960]   At Stop and Shop, I thought I was getting away with something
[00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:21.200]   because, well, I don't--
[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:23.520]   actually, I've got the card, but I don't want to use it.
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:25.280]   So wait, what's in these menus?
[00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:27.880]   Oh, forgot my-- oh, touch that.
[00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:30.160]   Saying, well, would you like to verify with your phone number?
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:31.440]   Or no, I don't.
[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:33.280]   Look, OK, thank you for scanning your cards.
[00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:35.560]   Like, yes, I'm getting away with something until it wasn't
[00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:37.920]   like for six months later, I realized, oh, that's right.
[00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:40.000]   I'm actually using my credit card.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:40.840]   And they can see that.
[00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:42.600]   And so they're going to figure that out.
[00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:44.440]   If they didn't have that, they'd figure out that, OK,
[00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:48.000]   who tends to make some mistakenly touch the Spanish button
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.720]   and then have to go back for English?
[00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:52.480]   OK, they got me.
[00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:54.800]   You have to-- just like when I bought my bike,
[00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:58.240]   I had to make peace with the fact that there are bad people
[00:23:58.240 --> 00:23:59.640]   out there who were going to try to steal it
[00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:01.760]   and that if I were riding that bike and locking it
[00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:04.160]   places long enough, at one point, it's going to get stolen.
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:07.520]   And so I have to ask myself, do I want to never ride my bike,
[00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:10.760]   or do I want to simply accept that bad things can be mitigated,
[00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:12.360]   but they can't be completely gotten rid of.
[00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:14.920]   And privacy is really one of those things.
[00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:17.240]   There's an interesting article by a developer named Kyn
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:22.800]   on Medium that sort of deep dives into Apple's computer vision.
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:24.840]   And he said, there's seven emotions
[00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:28.840]   that it can detect, including greedy, discussed, neutral scams,
[00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:30.920]   smiling, surprise, and suspicious.
[00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:32.000]   And thousands--
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.040]   The new Disney live action remade a Snow White.
[00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:37.440]   4,432 different objects.
[00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:39.520]   And they've got everything from graphs to gators,
[00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:43.120]   to automatic teller machines, to toilets, to biscotti,
[00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:46.080]   to-- I want to know who programmed in biscotti, caramelles,
[00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:48.600]   cheesecake, dining rooms.
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:49.880]   And the list goes on and on.
[00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:52.760]   And he is finding it does pull up not just a mountain,
[00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:56.480]   but some types of mountains, like with actual locations
[00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:57.280]   of mountains.
[00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:58.920]   But obviously, it's early days and stuff
[00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:01.840]   hasn't even shipped yet.
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:02.360]   Rockets.
[00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:04.200]   But it'll still be interesting to see how far they get
[00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:06.360]   compared to people who have been doing this for a long time.
[00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:06.860]   Yeah.
[00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:08.880]   And it'll be great to see another point of view
[00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:11.480]   on how deep learning can be used.
[00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:14.040]   Google does a really fantastic job with it.
[00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:16.080]   Because again, I use Google products every single day.
[00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:18.680]   And I'm routinely really, really pleased and surprised
[00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:20.000]   with how well it does.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.680]   As usual, when my train was an hour outside of DC,
[00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:25.960]   swipe left to Google now.
[00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:27.120]   I'm like, I'll be damned.
[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:29.440]   I didn't put a damn thing inside this page,
[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:32.960]   but it has figured out every single thing I would need to know.
[00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:35.560]   Also things that maybe I would like to know.
[00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:38.440]   I was shopping for-- I was looking at speakers
[00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:41.160]   last week, and it told me, oh, I noticed that you actually
[00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:43.640]   clicked on this link to learn more about the products page
[00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:44.240]   for this.
[00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:46.280]   Do you know that this store now has discounted it
[00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:49.160]   from $250 each to $150?
[00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:52.960]   Like, I did not know that, but I'm going to think about that.
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:55.480]   But it'll be good to see--
[00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:56.920]   Apple is not going to copy the way
[00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:59.800]   that Google turns that into actual practical features,
[00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:02.320]   the way that they can really figure out how can we best
[00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:03.000]   do that.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.280]   When you think about how they can apply deep learning
[00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:07.680]   to, let's say, the health app, and just simply
[00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:11.480]   very, very quietly, if I've told the app,
[00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:15.680]   or if my spouse or one of my children, adult children,
[00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:18.200]   has said I've talked it over with mom,
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:22.200]   and the mom is OK with Apple having access
[00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:25.320]   to pretty much all the sensory data that is picked up by health.
[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:28.840]   The ability to, after having an X number of tens or hundreds
[00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:31.040]   of thousands of people, enable that.
[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:35.080]   And be able to tell you, your mom or your caregiver,
[00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:36.840]   this is not a diagnosis.
[00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:39.880]   But the changes to your mother's gate,
[00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:43.320]   the slow end of the speed at which she now reads the pages,
[00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:45.760]   the unsteadiness when I can tell that she's holding it
[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:47.680]   in her left arm, as opposed to her right,
[00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:50.640]   these are good reasons to give her a get her a Parkinson's
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:52.920]   test, because we have noticed that there's
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:55.480]   a correlation between this data that we're taking over the past
[00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:57.720]   four or five months, and at least a good reason,
[00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:58.800]   at least have some tests done.
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:26:59.880]   Well, I think definitely we're going
[00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:02.040]   to see a lot with, as we look at the biometrics
[00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:03.480]   and everything else, we're going to see--
[00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:07.960]   as Apple has a higher sample rate, as health providers
[00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:09.040]   have a higher--
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:13.760]   and of course, using security and automizing the data.
[00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:15.840]   But they will be able to--
[00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:17.840]   I think we're going to see all kinds of correlations
[00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:19.360]   that you just never were able to sample.
[00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:21.920]   When you're waiting for someone to actually fill something out,
[00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:24.080]   to actually write something down, it
[00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:26.080]   is entirely different when it--
[00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:27.640]   because it took me a little while to go.
[00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:30.360]   How did my watch know that I was walking versus exercising
[00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:31.080]   versus--
[00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:32.520]   it's making all these decisions.
[00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:33.520]   I don't know if it's always accurate.
[00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:35.400]   But for some reason, when I fly, my watch
[00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:37.000]   thinks that I'm actually flying.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.200]   I always break the record on my exercise,
[00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:42.560]   because it's always like, and I don't quite understand why
[00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:43.080]   it does that.
[00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:43.600]   But it's--
[00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:45.800]   You think going 300 miles an hour?
[00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:46.440]   6 hours.
[00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:47.960]   It's like thinking that I'm actually flapping.
[00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:50.600]   Because I always go, you burned 2,000 calories today.
[00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:52.640]   I'm like, I flew to Istanbul.
[00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:55.120]   That should be a setting, because there are times
[00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:57.520]   where it's not until the next day or the day after.
[00:27:57.520 --> 00:27:58.800]   I was going through my Instagram.
[00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:03.520]   I tweeted a picture from a beautiful dusk picture
[00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:04.440]   in Boston Common.
[00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:06.200]   I said, well, it's one of those beautiful days
[00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:08.200]   that you don't notice until you look at your app that you
[00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:11.160]   actually walked longer than a half marathon.
[00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:13.280]   Because I actually had been walking from Cambridge
[00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:15.200]   to downtown Boston.
[00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:16.600]   Then I'll look at it.
[00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:18.840]   That wouldn't be 13 miles.
[00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:19.800]   I must have been on the train.
[00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:21.120]   It just jiggled it just enough.
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:23.680]   I didn't want to take it.
[00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:25.360]   I'd much rather believe the beautiful lie.
[00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:26.600]   This is a expressive talker.
[00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:27.840]   You talk to gesture.
[00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:28.440]   Exactly.
[00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:30.160]   The last thing I thought was really interesting.
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:32.080]   I think the line of the night went to Phil Schiller when
[00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:36.440]   John asked him about search ads in the app store.
[00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:38.360]   And Schiller just very calmly said, well, John,
[00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:41.800]   I noticed that before this show, you read three ads.
[00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:43.400]   And two out of the three seem to be
[00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:45.960]   relevant to the interests of this show.
[00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:49.800]   And a lot of stuff on the internet now is advertising backed.
[00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:52.080]   And he went on to explain sort of how the subscriptions would
[00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:54.000]   work and how an ideal world--
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.520]   you'd have subscriptions for every app.
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:57.680]   But there are, in some cases, legal concerns
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:00.320]   that the lawyers have to hammer out to decide that, yes,
[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:02.240]   you are providing ongoing value,
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:04.800]   commensurate with the ongoing subscription pricing.
[00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:06.800]   And it seemed like that was something Apple was still wrestling
[00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:08.480]   with.
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:10.040]   And I think they're going to continue to wrestle with.
[00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:12.120]   I think that ads have not been something that Apple has
[00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:13.880]   quite figured out, just because it's so not
[00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:14.800]   part of their culture.
[00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:19.040]   Collaborative workspaces and ads are not something that I
[00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:20.920]   think are Apple's strong suit at the moment.
[00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:23.480]   Remember when they had the--
[00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:26.240]   when Steve unveiled the ad network,
[00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:29.640]   it was such an Apple ad network that
[00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:32.880]   says that we are going to do most of these ads in the house.
[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:34.400]   And they're going to be beautiful.
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:37.840]   They're going to maximize the experience afforded
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:40.520]   by the context of this device.
[00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:43.800]   And everybody, I think users and advertisers are like,
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:46.360]   we're saying we want a picture of the car.
[00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:48.040]   We want a price on the car.
[00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:52.520]   We want to link the people can tap to get more information.
[00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:55.280]   I'm glad that you decided to do an augmented reality thing
[00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:57.360]   where we can imagine what this cloud in the sky would look
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:58.720]   like if the car was like.
[00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:01.400]   I'm saying that really we're OK with the way Google just--
[00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:02.760]   here's the JPEG.
[00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:04.680]   Here's the text.
[00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:07.880]   Now, bring us users.
[00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:09.960]   All right, so on the theme of ads,
[00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:12.080]   Leo was kind enough to record a few for us
[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:14.520]   while he was on Secret Special Assignment.
[00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:16.000]   So can we see one of those, Leo?
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:16.560]   Thanks, guys.
[00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:16.920]   Wait a minute.
[00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:18.120]   Let me interrupt just for a moment.
[00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:20.040]   If you don't mind, and we'll get back to Mac break weekly
[00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:23.800]   in a second, but first a word from our sponsor, as they say.
[00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:25.240]   Texture.
[00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:26.560]   I love texture.
[00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:30.560]   Texture is like Netflix for magazines, right?
[00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:35.360]   So with texture, you can binge read magazines
[00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:37.320]   to your heart's desire.
[00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:39.800]   I still think magazines represent one of the great art
[00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:40.840]   forms.
[00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:43.440]   I grew up reading punch.
[00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:44.840]   Remember punch?
[00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:45.400]   No, you wouldn't.
[00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:47.400]   That's a British humor magazine.
[00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:49.160]   I happen to subscribe to it.
[00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:50.240]   National Geographic.
[00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:52.080]   My grandma had stacks.
[00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:53.880]   The problem is those stacks, right?
[00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:55.080]   You subscribe to magazines.
[00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:56.040]   What are you going to do?
[00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:59.440]   You feel like a serial killer of trees?
[00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:00.640]   Not nice.
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:03.280]   And if you buy them on the newsstand once in a while,
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:04.640]   that can really hurt your pocketbook.
[00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:06.520]   Texture solves all that.
[00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:09.600]   The best magazines delivered right to your tablet
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:10.720]   or your phone.
[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:12.680]   You can read them at your convenience.
[00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:14.400]   And I'm talking the best magazines.
[00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:15.600]   You want the National Geographic?
[00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:16.040]   They got it.
[00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:16.920]   They don't have punch.
[00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:17.480]   OK?
[00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:21.280]   But they do have the New Yorker, which frankly is even better.
[00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:23.560]   They have Wired magazine rolling.
[00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:28.840]   So go to texture.com and see all the magazines you can get.
[00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:30.080]   Now here's the beauty part.
[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:33.160]   Every page of the newsstand issue.
[00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:35.320]   So you're never going to miss a thing.
[00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:39.560]   Plus bonus features you can't put in print, like videos.
[00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:41.360]   And then back issues too.
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:43.560]   You can download content before you get on the plane
[00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:45.160]   so you always have something to read.
[00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:47.200]   And one of my favorite parts is--
[00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:48.080]   and they encourages.
[00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:49.000]   You can share it.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.880]   You get five devices per account.
[00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:54.920]   So our family uses it.
[00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:57.240]   Michael's got his magazines.
[00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:59.480]   Boy's life-- I don't remember what he's--
[00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:01.800]   Boy's life probably, right?
[00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:03.120]   Lisa's got her magazines.
[00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:05.640]   I got my magazines all in the same texture account.
[00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:07.800]   So then it's really affordable.
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:09.720]   And no more coffee table clutter.
[00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:11.880]   You don't have to leave eight magazines in the seatback
[00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:13.440]   when you get off the plane.
[00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:16.000]   You can read the magazines to your heart's content.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.480]   And if you're not sure what to read,
[00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:20.480]   they've got a top stories and new and noteworthy section
[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:22.480]   to lead you to the best content.
[00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:24.520]   Their editorial staff is phenomenal.
[00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:29.520]   Texture is the way to read magazines for the 21st century.
[00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:31.120]   And I want you to try it for free right now.
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:37.680]   Go to texture.com/macbreaktexture.com/macbreak

[00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:41.720]   This is such a good idea.
[00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:43.400]   I'm so glad they came up with this.
[00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:46.160]   And they've saved me, by the way, a ton of money.
[00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:49.600]   Not to mention, a bunch of dead trees on my conscience.
[00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:51.000]   And a mess on my coffee table.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.680]   Texture.com/macbreak.
[00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:55.720]   Give it a try today.
[00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:58.360]   Back to Mac Break Weekly.
[00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:01.680]   And we are back with Andy Nocko from the Chicago Sun Times
[00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:03.560]   and the celestial waste of bandwidth,
[00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:06.880]   side by side with Alex Lindsay from the Pixel Core.
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:07.840]   Funzies.
[00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:10.920]   That must be an awesome setup, Alex.
[00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:12.120]   It's a pretty--
[00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:13.520]   It's kind of a messed up setup right now,
[00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:16.600]   but we had a little technical difficulties before the show.
[00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:17.800]   We just kept on adding boxes.
[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:19.040]   And so there are all everything piled up,
[00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:20.440]   and there's wires everywhere.
[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:23.640]   But I got to see focused Alex.
[00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:27.240]   Nothing's ever dizzy, but I'm saying deploy, deploy, deploy.
[00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:32.320]   I'm talking about the queen Elizabeth II was supposed
[00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:34.240]   to be on one half a second ago.
[00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:36.040]   But there's a glare coming off of her crown.
[00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:38.360]   And he's like, OK, I'm going to solve this crumb or problem.
[00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:39.440]   Was anybody knowing about it?
[00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:42.840]   And exactly 31 seconds.
[00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:44.320]   That was a little intense.
[00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:46.640]   So one of the things we saw this week was Bank of America
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:49.200]   has announced that they will let people use Apple watches
[00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:51.680]   at the ATM machine in lieu of a card.
[00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:53.760]   Traditionally, cards you've inserted them in.
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:55.360]   There has been some problem with fraud,
[00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:57.000]   with skimming, with things like that.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.320]   And now you can just go up to them.
[00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:00.520]   And the same way that you would use your Apple Watch
[00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:03.800]   to pay at a retailer, you can use the debit functionality
[00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:07.160]   to withdraw money at the ATM.
[00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:09.840]   Does that solve the peaking at the pin
[00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:11.880]   and the skimming problem, Andy?
[00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:12.720]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:14.080]   NFC is bulletproof.
[00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:15.600]   This will work with pretty much everything
[00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:20.560]   that uses NFC, including Google Android Pay.
[00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:27.000]   And yeah, I mean, there's such rigmarole to keep your card safe.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.480]   I always make sure that I block it with my hand
[00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:31.760]   when I'm inserting it.
[00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:33.200]   Always make sure I block it with my hand.
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:35.000]   I whip it out and put it right back in the wallet.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:36.280]   And then when I have to type in my pin,
[00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:39.760]   I always unfold my wallet, cover the entire keypad.
[00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:42.880]   And I can actually type in my pin by feel.
[00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:46.880]   And with NFC, there's just so much to do to break that.
[00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:50.080]   That why would somebody want to get the amount of money
[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:52.160]   that a freelance print journalist has
[00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:55.280]   and is checking account when you could basically own
[00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:58.600]   the entire banking system if you can break NFC.
[00:34:58.600 --> 00:34:59.920]   So yeah, this is long overdue.
[00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:01.400]   And I'd love to see even gas stations.
[00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:04.760]   I'd love to see it everywhere that I want to keep my pace.
[00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:05.880]   I don't want to type codes in.
[00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:07.240]   I don't want to give in with my credit card.
[00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:09.320]   I don't want to like, you get used to that.
[00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:11.040]   And I think I don't.
[00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:14.320]   And cold and flu season, I don't want to touch the keypad.
[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:15.080]   Right. Right.
[00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:17.240]   I mean, I just don't want to, you know, like, there's,
[00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:20.520]   you suddenly, I think when you start using Apple Pay,
[00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:22.480]   you suddenly start realizing how insecure
[00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:24.480]   your entire life was for so long.
[00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:26.480]   You know, you're just like, what were we doing?
[00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:28.440]   You know, even the chip card and all the other stuff,
[00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:29.480]   that just inconvenient.
[00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:31.400]   You know, like the chip card takes forever.
[00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:33.600]   Now that now that we Americans are being subjected to it,
[00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:35.200]   we're all like, oh, what the heck?
[00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:36.120]   I believe it there.
[00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:37.400]   And then I have to do this thing.
[00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:39.960]   It's even worse because you stick it in there.
[00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:43.800]   And okay, so the bottom seven digits of my credit card number
[00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:45.760]   are completely exposed.
[00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:49.600]   So I have to like, again, put it in, hold my hand over it.
[00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:52.000]   And then at least the ones that my drugstore, for instance,
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:55.160]   it gives you that sound saying, it's your turn.
[00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:56.320]   It's been successful.
[00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:58.480]   Like, thank you very much for making me think
[00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:03.680]   there was supposed to be $1,800 and available on my credit card.
[00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:05.200]   Yeah. So I think that I.
[00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:06.640]   A lateral move to be sure.
[00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:07.640]   Yeah.
[00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:08.640]   It was great for me.
[00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:10.760]   I went to the airport and I went to the coffee place.
[00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:11.760]   I paid with Apple Pay.
[00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:12.760]   I went to the gate.
[00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:15.480]   I checked in with my boarding pass, was on my Apple watch.
[00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:17.320]   I didn't pull out my phone the entire time.
[00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:19.520]   I just walked around the bag and one hand on my watch on the other.
[00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:21.160]   It's halfway all the way through.
[00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:22.160]   How do you know?
[00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:24.240]   The question is, how do you do the whole, like, I'm going to do a.
[00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:28.200]   So I tend to turn my watch in, you know, under like this.
[00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:29.200]   So that I can.
[00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:30.200]   I've done that.
[00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:31.200]   So I can just go like this over top of it.
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:34.640]   But I still feel a little geeky because it's always like, there's a little bit of effort
[00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:37.440]   to get the United app to stay up and open.
[00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:38.920]   So it's not like never.
[00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:42.240]   I find that with my phone, it's a little bit more casual with my watch.
[00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:44.120]   I feel like I'm still working too hard to do it.
[00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:45.760]   Their Canada's done a really good job lately.
[00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:47.160]   They've even started pushing gate.
[00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:50.000]   Like for a while, the gate was just blank all the time and yet to go like an animal to
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.600]   the physical screen to see where your plane was going.
[00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:54.160]   But now they're pushing the gate updates.
[00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:57.800]   I've done the watch turn around, but they don't have any sort of top part on their scanner.
[00:36:57.800 --> 00:36:59.600]   It's just a bottom scanner plate.
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:00.600]   So I get I get it ready.
[00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:01.600]   It stays there.
[00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:04.240]   It gives me about two or three minutes, I think, on timeout.
[00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:06.040]   So I do it when I'm right before there.
[00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:09.760]   And there's always a moment of abject horror on the person's face because they're seeing
[00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:12.160]   you try something they haven't really seen that often before.
[00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:13.640]   And they're sure it's not going to work.
[00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:16.040]   It's going to delay everybody and they're going to get frustrated.
[00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:19.500]   And then you just tap and whether it's a cashier who doesn't have to make change or
[00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:23.440]   process a credit card or it's the gate agent who doesn't have to, you know, because they
[00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:26.480]   get nervous when they're picking up your phone too, because maybe they've dropped several
[00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:27.480]   over the last few years.
[00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:31.760]   And you just tap it and you go through and there's this big enormous let go of breath.
[00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:34.840]   And they get really, really excited and they almost want to high five you and then you
[00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:36.800]   just go on to the point.
[00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:37.800]   It's been two years.
[00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:40.880]   Don't we all still feel like we're getting away with something when we just wave our
[00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:45.480]   phone and then walk away with the hamburger and like, hey, I didn't pay anything for you.
[00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:53.040]   But it's interesting that there really are still these human social interface components.
[00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:58.240]   Even when I had my Apple watch on, which again, best NFC cannot come to Android.
[00:37:58.240 --> 00:37:59.240]   We're fast enough.
[00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:04.520]   This is the one feature I categorically miss of Apple watch because that is just damn near
[00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:05.520]   magic.
[00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:10.160]   But even when I have my Apple watch though, if I'm at a cat, if I'm at a cashier, I would
[00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:11.160]   take it.
[00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:14.000]   I like that the actuality of I'm taking the cashier can see me.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.360]   I'm taking up my phone.
[00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:19.240]   I am resting it down on the pad where it says, rest your phone here.
[00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:23.520]   And if he or she glances up, she sees that, okay, he's paying with his phone as opposed
[00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:26.280]   to he's just standing there looking at me expecting Lee.
[00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:27.280]   Is he a creep?
[00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:28.280]   Is he an idiot?
[00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:31.400]   I don't know how money works or did I miss something?
[00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:35.040]   I think for me, the big one is, and you know, it's the future, but when you're at the Apple
[00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:39.600]   store and you buy your own stuff with your own phone, but you just get to scan it and
[00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:43.720]   you're walking, every day I walk out, I'm always like, I really didn't pay for this.
[00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:46.080]   That's how I feel with Nexus at customs.
[00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:49.120]   Like I'm just sure I'm going to get tackled after I go four feet through the airport because
[00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:50.200]   you just walk out.
[00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:51.440]   It's ridiculous.
[00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:55.960]   I want to make an offer to, I know there are people who want to have a successful YouTube
[00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:56.960]   channel.
[00:38:56.960 --> 00:39:04.080]   But if you have like, if I see an actual legit video of someone dressed up like the hamburger,
[00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:11.960]   who actually like walks into the Apple store like, and walks up with like an expensive
[00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:16.880]   piece of kit, and of course they've actually paid for it, dressed as the hamburger.
[00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:20.000]   I will fund you at at least the $5 a month level.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   There you go.
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   There you go.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.880]   I was talking to a developer, WWDC, and of course they brought Apple Pay to the Mac through
[00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:30.880]   Safari, but right now you have to authenticate with an Apple Watch or an iPhone.
[00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:34.320]   Maybe Touch ID will come to a Mac or a future Mac and we won't have to do that anymore.
[00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:38.840]   But the developer was saying it's sophisticated enough that they can maybe start to detect
[00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:42.160]   whether you have an iPhone or Apple Watch and proximity and only give you the Apple Pay
[00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:44.960]   button if they detect that it's there.
[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:46.760]   And then you don't create a shopping cart anymore.
[00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:49.960]   You just hit the Apple Pay button and in the background they bundle up everything that
[00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:51.400]   you buy and ship it to you.
[00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:53.680]   And there's no longer this thing of, do you want to keep shopping?
[00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:54.680]   Do you want to check out?
[00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:55.680]   Do you want to go to your cart?
[00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:58.560]   Do you want to have all these items bundled together for your convenience?
[00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:01.560]   It's just they detect the Apple Watch or the iPhone.
[00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:06.360]   It shoots a secure token over a secure continuity connection and your purchases come to you.
[00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:09.320]   And it's increasingly feeling like Andy said, like magic.
[00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:10.320]   Yeah.
[00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:11.400]   And Google's actually been testing out.
[00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:15.680]   They have a pilot program I think in the Bay Area with some McDonald's and some other
[00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:20.280]   stores like that where there are sensors in the arches of the, as you enter the store
[00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:26.280]   where it can read your profile, read your digital footprint coming in and verify that
[00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:29.480]   it's not just that someone walked in with your phone, but there is a combination of
[00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:33.400]   Bluetooth transponders that we associate with this person, which means that when this person
[00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:37.480]   goes, takes their purchases to the cashier, the cashier is just saying, there is no check
[00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:38.480]   for this table.
[00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:39.480]   No check.
[00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:40.480]   Yes.
[00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:41.480]   Your money is not good here, Mr. Enovco.
[00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:43.480]   God bless you in the work you do.
[00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:48.080]   Enjoy your career, those NFC ad chips so that you can't sideload your own ads.
[00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:50.480]   All right, growing pants.
[00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:55.280]   We didn't really get to start selling pants with like, you know, copper line pockets.
[00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:59.840]   We didn't have Alex here last week, so we didn't get too deep into Apple TV, but there
[00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:01.200]   was a lot of really good announcements there.
[00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:05.120]   Alex, including like the dark mode for the home theater, but also the single sign on.
[00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:09.040]   I wasn't too excited because I'm a cable cutter, but I imagine for people who do have
[00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:13.080]   like Comcast or Dish Network or something like that, this is a huge relief just in terms
[00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:14.720]   of getting online with their apps.
[00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:15.960]   It is so annoying.
[00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:18.280]   Like all these different codes and everything else.
[00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:21.960]   And I have to be an I'm a cable cutter, so it didn't affect me as much, but I know that
[00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:25.480]   when I had cable, it was annoying to have to go to different ones and everything else.
[00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:33.200]   So that was, but now basically if I can't get the internet version of the channel, I don't
[00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:35.600]   have access to it.
[00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:43.160]   And I watched the Golden State Warriors and the Cavaliers on ESPN and we watch Penny Dreadful
[00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:46.040]   on Showtime and Game of Thrones on HBO.
[00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:50.280]   So I have all, and I pay whatever subscriptions that are connected to that because for me,
[00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:54.200]   that's still a lot less than I was going to pay because I don't watch that many shows.
[00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:59.560]   So because I'm not surfing, looking for something to watch, it's actually very easy for me to
[00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:05.960]   pay $7.99 or $9.99 or whatever for the handful of HBO and Netflix and Showtime and a couple
[00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:09.680]   of other channels, it's still less than the cable.
[00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:18.720]   And I can watch it whenever I want, the idea of being tied into a schedule now, my kids,
[00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:23.160]   they were very confused by ads for a long time because they just didn't grow up with
[00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:24.160]   them.
[00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:25.160]   That's the crazy thing.
[00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:28.800]   And broken people of the habit of expecting that this is part of the deal that you're
[00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:30.960]   going to sign by watching Oprah or whatever.
[00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:37.520]   Well, and also we had TV for a month when we were in Pittsburgh and we thought, oh,
[00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:41.360]   maybe we'll get TV out here because the bandwidth wasn't very high, so you couldn't watch all
[00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:43.000]   the stuff you want.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:46.440]   And the first two weeks, my kids were just frustrated that the show kept on stopping.
[00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:48.080]   They're like, what is going on?
[00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:51.640]   And my son would be like, oh, you've got to be kidding me.
[00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:53.240]   You know, like every time it stopped.
[00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:57.920]   And then the second half of it, they were asking for so many stupid little toys that
[00:42:57.920 --> 00:43:00.600]   in between, we realized they were starting to get used to it.
[00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:03.760]   Now they were starting to ask us for all these things that literally don't exist for them
[00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:07.080]   if they're not watching morning cartoons.
[00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:11.280]   And then we were like, OK, we've got to get rid of the subscription pretty quickly.
[00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:17.480]   It's kind of remarkable how quickly a habit that America has been in since 1958 can be
[00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:18.480]   broken.
[00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:23.360]   10 years ago, I might have thought that, oh my God, what a sacrifice it would be because
[00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:27.120]   I can't miss all these shows I really, really like.
[00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:33.120]   And really all it took was me never getting around, moving to a new house and never quite
[00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:39.560]   getting around calling Verizon to install cable in my living room.
[00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:43.320]   They installed it in, it was installed in my office because that was where the broadband
[00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:44.320]   hasn't come into.
[00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:48.360]   It was installed in my bedroom because I'm not going to fall asleep reading a book like
[00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:52.440]   some sort of creature foul from the primary lose.
[00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:55.040]   But it's like, I just never got around to it, which meant that if I'm in the living room,
[00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:58.840]   which is the most comfortable place to lounge around in, OK, well, I've got my Roku box.
[00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:02.720]   I guess I'll watch YouTube and I guess I'll watch whatever streaming channels are available.
[00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:06.120]   And no, I don't have to, I don't get to watch everything that I want to watch, but there
[00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:09.840]   is so much great content on YouTube that fills the void.
[00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:16.200]   And that's in the past five years Netflix has legitimately turned into the most ass-kicking
[00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:20.680]   content provider ever, not just, not just, you know, a mid-list movies that are kind of
[00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:24.520]   OK and TV shows that you never really got into, but OK, you'll watch it.
[00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:26.240]   I'm talking about like destination.
[00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:28.240]   Voltron Andy Voltron.
[00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:29.240]   Exactly.
[00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:34.120]   They're having all the start in July, they're getting every single Star Trek movie, except
[00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:36.440]   for the first one, plus the Trekkies documentary.
[00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:38.920]   So that's going to be like an entire day of watching.
[00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:45.120]   And so, and also, I'll also let's admit that cable TV has gotten so much crappier since
[00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:47.680]   I moved into that house.
[00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:53.560]   And so I was like, I don't think that the cable company understands that you need to
[00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:58.720]   keep paying micro as much money as you need to to keep them making dirty jobs because
[00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:05.920]   once Mike Rose and dirty jobs go away, once Adam and Jamie stop making mythbusters,
[00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:09.040]   OK, OK, that's another channel that I no longer need.
[00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:11.920]   Now it's down to I need my project runway.
[00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:17.320]   I want, I would like to keep getting the food network and I need my turn.
[00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:20.000]   Amazing, but that's on broadcast.
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:21.000]   That's OK.
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:26.520]   And because now all those channels are on the sling service and because sling is now
[00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:36.160]   on Apple TV, I'm seriously like, I'm just, it's just so hard to like say that I'm going
[00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:41.840]   to cancel my cable subscriptions because it's such a part of life, especially for a freelancer
[00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:46.840]   who spends a lot of time during the day inside the house and has to keep himself amused.
[00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:49.400]   It's like, but really you could, you could do this.
[00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:50.600]   It would be perfectly fine.
[00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:53.720]   Slinging is picking up the slack so wonderfully.
[00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:55.000]   Why would you have to sling app?
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:58.120]   You got a series search for YouTube videos, which looks really awesome.
[00:45:58.120 --> 00:45:59.120]   And you got live tuning.
[00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:03.120]   So you can just ask for a live program and it'll go right to it if it's available to you.
[00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:08.200]   Well, and I have to admit that I part of why I like not having cable is because it keeps
[00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:09.840]   me from just sitting down there surfing.
[00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:11.880]   Like I go down for as a destination.
[00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:14.240]   Like I want to go watch this thing and I want to go down.
[00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:17.440]   Now sometimes I'll roam around movies or roam around, but it's not the same.
[00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:21.240]   There's something about the not clicking until you stop.
[00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:26.400]   You know, like, you know, that is that I find myself, I've decided that's actually it's
[00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:28.760]   like not keeping a lot of alcohol in the house.
[00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:32.600]   That's not that I would never be a problem for me.
[00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:35.400]   That's the same reason why I don't buy, don't buy cookies and stuff like that.
[00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:36.400]   Yeah, yes.
[00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:37.400]   It's too easy.
[00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:39.760]   It's too easy just to nibble when you should be anticipating and having a good time with.
[00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:45.440]   But yeah, I mean, I don't, I still have to watch the Colbert show live because ever since
[00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:53.560]   I was 17 years old that they line of deep there's been this trench in my day that goes from
[00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:59.200]   11 30 until 12, at least be 12 30 until 1 30 with Letterman's old show, then 11 30
[00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:03.800]   to 12 30 that said, whatever you're doing right now, Andy, you're going to stop and
[00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:07.080]   then you're going to watch that you're going to watch this show that you're going to enjoy.
[00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:10.840]   And then after that, you're going to contemplate what you're going to do with the next 30 minutes
[00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:14.400]   to four hours of productivity you think you have next.
[00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:19.560]   I was so discombobulated when between those two shows when it's like there's 11 30 and
[00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:20.720]   I have nothing to do.
[00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:23.560]   I can just, I'm just going to sit in the sofa now and look at that look at that.
[00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:28.920]   But now you have you have a playground to play with.
[00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:29.920]   Yeah.
[00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:31.880]   But yeah, I mean, it's terrible.
[00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:37.680]   Also, the game of thrown like the last no spoilers, but like this week's episode, I read
[00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:42.720]   that it costs $10 million to produce this one episode and took them like 28 days to film
[00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:47.040]   because it's a huge, huge battle scene that they've been promoting for like two months
[00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:49.520]   and like the second to last episode of the season.
[00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:55.200]   And it's like, I'm sitting there with my Roku like with the remote in my hand saying
[00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:58.120]   that they spent $10 million for this.
[00:47:58.120 --> 00:48:02.880]   I bet like people like broke their knees because of the battle scene, but they're basically
[00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:08.400]   at parity with the hydraulic press channel because it's like, I kind of want to see what
[00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:13.360]   would happen if you had a steel ball bearing and a hydraulic press, which one would win.
[00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:18.320]   And it's like, how much does a ball bearing cost like $2 and 10 cents?
[00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:22.040]   You didn't have to buy a blank videotape for this.
[00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:25.680]   It's all like on a reusable video of a digital media.
[00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:30.360]   It's like, and I can legitimately say that I am from a lot of broadcast television.
[00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:35.680]   I am as amused by by watching some of these people soldering and by watching.
[00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:36.680]   I think that build it.
[00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:39.760]   But I think from a content perspective, one of the things, because we're doing a lot,
[00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:42.680]   we do a lot of events for a lot of people and we get to see this huge range of people
[00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:45.080]   spending what they're permanent.
[00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:50.080]   So some of the events that we work on that people are spending a couple tens of dollars
[00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:53.400]   per minute and other ones we're spending, they're spending thousands and thousands of
[00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:54.480]   dollars per minute.
[00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:59.640]   And there's no correlation to viewership and what you spend.
[00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:06.600]   There's definitely like a, you see so often, it's become so important.
[00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:08.600]   It's become so important where the story is all that matters.
[00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:09.880]   The story is really all that matters.
[00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:13.880]   And it can be a very simple amateur story and it can be a funny kid or someone doing
[00:49:13.880 --> 00:49:17.080]   something, it doesn't have to be these huge production dies.
[00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:19.160]   Although I do appreciate the production dies.
[00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:23.040]   We don't want to have the folks at Game of Thrones think I think they would definitely
[00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:27.120]   do better if they spent $10 million in episode every episode all the time.
[00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:30.440]   I wasn't suggesting that that episode Game of Thrones was not as good.
[00:49:30.440 --> 00:49:35.440]   I'm saying it's every bit as good as the steel ball bearing compression in hydraulic press.
[00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:42.800]   >> No, I was, I came in back to, I hope this doesn't sound mean spirited because inside
[00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:44.160]   my head it does not mean spirited at all.
[00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:46.400]   It's just an interesting data point.
[00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:52.680]   Harry Knowles, who does, of course, Ina Cool News, tried to crowd fund a season of this
[00:49:52.680 --> 00:49:56.880]   movie show that he used to do for the Nerdist channel when Nerdist decided not to continue
[00:49:56.880 --> 00:49:57.880]   to produce it.
[00:49:57.880 --> 00:50:01.600]   And so part of it, he like, here as part of the campaign package, he showed like some
[00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:06.800]   of the episodes that he'd been doing, and it really made me think that this is exactly
[00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:12.680]   how not to do a YouTube show because he built a whole set that made him look like a basement
[00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:15.560]   and he had all these totally unnecessary digital effects.
[00:50:15.560 --> 00:50:20.160]   And whenever they need to throw it to a clip, he would like walk, like lean over to this
[00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:25.400]   little miniature, like a light lamp house and the miniature, hey, grandpa, why don't you
[00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:29.440]   roll that clip and there be miniature grandpas, the crew McKeed in, like doing this.
[00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:34.400]   Like, all you have to do is like have a camera, get some decent lighting, get a decent microphone
[00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:39.080]   and share what you feel about movies in a way that's engaging with people.
[00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:44.040]   He was trying, he needed to raise like $150,000 for a show that really could have cost him
[00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:49.560]   maybe if he was starting with bare walls and no equipment, should have cost him maybe $2,000,
[00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:51.600]   including the equipment that he was going to buy and keep.
[00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:54.720]   And if you look at the production value of fiscal me, Bert.
[00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:55.720]   Exactly.
[00:50:55.720 --> 00:50:59.800]   So sort of that point, Alex, is the original, I mean, I don't think it's a secret that
[00:50:59.800 --> 00:51:03.480]   one of the original plans for the new Apple TV box was a streaming was to make agreements
[00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:08.560]   with cable companies and offer more traditional TV packages and apps was sort of something
[00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:10.480]   that had to be pushed up from the bottom.
[00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:12.760]   And now they say everything is apps.
[00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:15.040]   Are we at a point with the Apple TV where we have enough apps?
[00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:17.720]   Do Zappal need to continue to make those deals?
[00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:21.600]   Do they need to get into original programming or can what you and Andy are talking about
[00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:25.320]   come to pass where sort of we become the new video, the new video generation?
[00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:29.440]   I wouldn't be surprised that Apple doesn't move down the content path because I think
[00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:31.960]   that there's definitely some opportunities there for them.
[00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:37.040]   And I think that I do think that they want to keep on pushing that process.
[00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:38.040]   I think I don't.
[00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:41.360]   I think that Apple, you know, I know that there was, we had heard rumors.
[00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:45.240]   I don't know if it was actually true or not that Apple was looking at like things like
[00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:47.160]   NFL and so on and so forth.
[00:51:47.160 --> 00:51:51.600]   And I think that those are those are things that Apple actually can is uniquely positioned.
[00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:55.200]   You know, I don't think they can just generate a bunch of new content necessarily.
[00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:58.840]   But I think Apple is uniquely positioned to do something like I can spend more money
[00:51:58.840 --> 00:52:02.000]   than the networks to make this available.
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:06.640]   You know, like, like I really can't just drop the, you know, you drop the hammer if we want
[00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:07.640]   to.
[00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:10.840]   And I think that they are in a position to take advantage of some of that in a way that
[00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:12.400]   other folks can't.
[00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:15.680]   And I think that that would be that that turning point, I think, where people suddenly just
[00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:20.000]   have live access to NFL games or whatever that you would.
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:21.000]   Only on Apple TV.
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:26.080]   You know, if they did that, I mean, it would, you know, that would be a real turning point
[00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:28.200]   for streaming, streaming video, I think.
[00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:33.280]   I really think this is, this is one of those areas in which Apple totally missed the pitch.
[00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:37.360]   Just like this is Polaroid not think, not realizing that digital was going to eat their
[00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:39.040]   lunch and put them in a grave.
[00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:43.640]   I don't think that I think that Apple missed the opportunity to become what Hulu is and
[00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:45.800]   what Netflix is.
[00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:50.240]   Because I think right now we're in a position where a creator would actually, now actually
[00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:53.880]   would rather go to Netflix first than a network.
[00:52:53.880 --> 00:52:58.320]   I was reading some stuff about this and talked to a friend of mine who covers industry in
[00:52:58.320 --> 00:53:03.480]   LA because Netflix is a network certain that in the position where they are, they're not,
[00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:10.040]   they're so making money on a show as such and if he proposition for them that they are
[00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:14.320]   not going to let you make a show unless they are have that you give them part ownership
[00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:15.320]   of it.
[00:53:15.320 --> 00:53:18.240]   And also they're not going to let you make the show unless they have approval over literally
[00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:19.240]   everything.
[00:53:19.240 --> 00:53:24.680]   Whereas a generation ago the producers of Cheers, they would, the network through the
[00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:27.880]   process of who they cast and what scripts go into production.
[00:53:27.880 --> 00:53:32.080]   But at some point they've proven that they know how to do this show and the executives
[00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:36.680]   who are grateful that their entire attention can be focused on actual problems.
[00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:42.960]   Now you cannot, if you have a background extra who has one line, you have to submit candidates
[00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:46.440]   to the network and the network will pick who's going to do for you.
[00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:50.640]   And now that it's like if you go to Netflix, you get to own it, you get to cast who you
[00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:54.320]   want, you get to reap most of the rewards from it.
[00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:59.600]   I think that, I think that Apple would, if Apple were to create their own productions,
[00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:04.160]   it would be situations where here is a person that we love working with and here's an idea
[00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:07.000]   that we love or here's something we don't think anybody else is going to do unless we
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:10.160]   do it or they're not going to do it the way that it should be done.
[00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:17.800]   I don't see them creating the next house of cards or orange is the new black, but I think
[00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:23.080]   that they would definitely do certain projects that they're really, really pleased about
[00:54:23.080 --> 00:54:24.080]   and just add that to the world.
[00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:25.880]   Or something that pushes the envelope.
[00:54:25.880 --> 00:54:31.360]   I think that one of the things that we're, right now, our online folks, whether it's
[00:54:31.360 --> 00:54:39.120]   Amazon or Netflix or Apple, have gotten really good at playing TV's game really, really
[00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:40.120]   hard.
[00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:42.720]   One thing that they've disrupted is they said, "Okay, we're going to let you binge watch.
[00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:44.640]   We're going to give you all of these episodes all at one time."
[00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:46.680]   That's the one change that they've made.
[00:54:46.680 --> 00:54:51.760]   There are so many other, when it comes to providing social outlets, providing augmented
[00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:57.520]   data, providing all these other things that online can do so much better than broadcast.
[00:54:57.520 --> 00:55:01.520]   Even now, resolution, I think that we're going to have to see sometime in the near future.
[00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:08.720]   Netflix is already starting to do 4K, Amazon is doing 4K, Apple is still stuck at 1080P.
[00:55:08.720 --> 00:55:12.600]   But I think that resolution is one thing that as people get more of these TVs can distinguish
[00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:16.120]   online because TV is about to become the little screen.
[00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:22.800]   TV is like, they're still standard dev TV networks or stations and it's going to take
[00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:26.520]   forever to get out of 1080i for a cable because they already spent millions and millions of
[00:55:26.520 --> 00:55:29.200]   dollars on it.
[00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:37.240]   They can't get to 1080P, let alone 3840.
[00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:40.880]   I think that resolution is one place they could do it, but also adding interactivity, letting
[00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:44.000]   people have online experiences while they're watching these things.
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:49.440]   I think it's something that we haven't seen yet.
[00:55:49.440 --> 00:55:53.920]   In that social area where we watch a TV show or a football game and we're all talking about
[00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:58.040]   it together, that's something that right now online doesn't really do very well and it
[00:55:58.040 --> 00:55:59.040]   could.
[00:55:59.040 --> 00:56:01.200]   Well, Twitter doesn't really well.
[00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:07.200]   I'm saying if we want to watch House of Cards and we all decide we want to watch it together,
[00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:13.880]   it doesn't just start at 1pm and we can all sit there and go, "Oh my gosh."
[00:56:13.880 --> 00:56:18.760]   That we've lost, I think, and I think that there needs to at some point be a way to reinsert
[00:56:18.760 --> 00:56:20.160]   that as making it a social experience.
[00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:24.000]   Wouldn't that be cool if you could do that sort of as a hangout?
[00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:28.680]   If Netflix decided to create that feature where you already have a social group that
[00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:32.400]   you're making recommendations to and you can see what they're writing, but you can
[00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:36.680]   say, "Okay, I want Alex, I want Renee, I want Leo, and we've all decided that we're
[00:56:36.680 --> 00:56:38.920]   going to watch Catty Shack together tonight."
[00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:40.760]   We're better.
[00:56:40.760 --> 00:56:43.680]   The cast of Catty Shack says, "We're going to watch it and we're going to talk about
[00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:44.680]   it."
[00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:49.520]   If you want to watch it with us and hear us and ask questions and everything else, hit
[00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:52.880]   this button on the West Wing podcast, but broadcast it.
[00:56:52.880 --> 00:56:58.320]   It's not the night that it was debuted, it's like the next up.
[00:56:58.320 --> 00:57:03.320]   That would give everybody, from a pure revenue perspective, that gives everyone a reason
[00:57:03.320 --> 00:57:06.640]   to watch it that night or a reason to watch it at least once before that.
[00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:10.920]   We're going to have the guys, the writers and the actors from Breaking Bad talk about
[00:57:10.920 --> 00:57:13.360]   that episode during that episode.
[00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:17.360]   You can actually hear their voice over top of it or see texts or whatever.
[00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:22.480]   Again, you don't need a whole infrastructure to do that because Twitter can be exploited
[00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:24.880]   so well by clever people.
[00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:28.880]   This season of Amazing Race, Phil Kogan, I will never pronounce this correctly, has
[00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:29.880]   less time correctly.
[00:57:29.880 --> 00:57:33.280]   I've also never had his body, so that's fine.
[00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:35.680]   Or Charch and I are the way he can.
[00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:40.040]   In many ways, I'm deficient and I'm apologizing for mispronouncing his name.
[00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:45.440]   The show now, for both the East Coast and the West Coast feeds, Phil is there tweeting
[00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:48.840]   behind the scenes stuff and people who are on the race are also doing the stuff.
[00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:52.600]   If you hashtag your comments, maybe he'll respond to it.
[00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:57.680]   Alton Brown live tweets during Cut the Road Kitchen, the first Ayrings.
[00:57:57.680 --> 00:58:01.480]   He draws all of his answers on the Post-It notes because he's looking for people who are
[00:58:01.480 --> 00:58:05.480]   asking questions and he is staying completely in character as the mean.
[00:58:05.480 --> 00:58:08.920]   What is this thing with the Post-It notes?
[00:58:08.920 --> 00:58:10.320]   I don't know.
[00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:11.320]   It's cool.
[00:58:11.320 --> 00:58:16.000]   There's a lot of people that do that and I'm like, why are you also science?
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:18.560]   NSA has no business.
[00:58:18.560 --> 00:58:19.560]   Look at that.
[00:58:19.560 --> 00:58:20.560]   Minding the data.
[00:58:20.560 --> 00:58:21.560]   How he's responding.
[00:58:21.560 --> 00:58:24.200]   How people do these three chefs?
[00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:25.200]   They only have two words.
[00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:27.000]   They have piles of Post-It notes.
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:28.800]   It's three feet high.
[00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:31.000]   Mission, that's all I gotta say.
[00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:35.960]   On that note, we're going to once again hand it over to Leo so he can tell us about something
[00:58:35.960 --> 00:58:39.480]   almost as amazing as Alton Brown and his NSA post-It notes.
[00:58:39.480 --> 00:58:41.400]   Our show today brought to you by Wealthfront.
[00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:42.400]   Thanks guys.
[00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:43.400]   We'll be right back to Mac Break Weekly.
[00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:49.400]   A bit Wealthfront though is so important because everybody who's listening must have
[00:58:49.400 --> 00:58:51.400]   savings, right?
[00:58:51.400 --> 00:58:56.400]   For a rainy day, for your retirement, your kids, are they going to college?
[00:58:56.400 --> 00:58:58.280]   You better save just in case.
[00:58:58.280 --> 00:59:01.840]   All of this means you've got to be putting money in something.
[00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:04.400]   I'm not talking about savings account or a CD.
[00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:07.560]   Something that's going to grow an active investment.
[00:59:07.560 --> 00:59:14.080]   Then you either have to manage it yourself, which trust me is not going to go well because
[00:59:14.080 --> 00:59:15.560]   who has time?
[00:59:15.560 --> 00:59:18.640]   Maybe every year you'll look at it or you pay somebody to do that.
[00:59:18.640 --> 00:59:24.160]   When I say pay, you pay 1%, 2%, 3% a year for everything you've got in your management.
[00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:30.800]   That can really add up.
[00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:32.800]   That means you have to make 3% more just to pay for the manager, not to mention the transaction.
[00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:35.880]   This is no way to build a nest egg.
[00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:37.680]   Wealthfront is how you want to do this.
[00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:38.680]   Take a look.
[00:59:38.680 --> 00:59:41.880]   I'm not telling you to buy because as always with any investment when you're going to put
[00:59:41.880 --> 00:59:47.600]   your hard-earned money, you're going to want to go to wealthfront.com/macbreak and you're
[00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:51.800]   going to want to take a look, read up about it.
[00:59:51.800 --> 00:59:53.720]   But I can tell you what I think is really great.
[00:59:53.720 --> 01:00:01.720]   First of all, not 1%, 2% or 3% a year in management fees, 1 quarter of 1%.
[01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:03.920]   1 quarter of 1%.
[01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:15.120]   If you use our special offer, which is wealthfront.com/macbreak, 0% of 1%, nothing for the first $15,000,
[01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:17.120]   which is fantastic.
[01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:20.520]   By the way, you also can get started as low as $500.
[01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:21.520]   It's easy to get started.
[01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:22.520]   How does it work?
[01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:23.520]   Well, there's no human advisor.
[01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:25.360]   There's a computer program.
[01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:29.560]   But a computer program written by the biggest, best brains in the business.
[01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:33.760]   People who wrote the books like Charles D. Ellison, Burton Malkeel, they've got an advisory
[01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:35.360]   board to die for.
[01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:39.920]   It's based on Nobel Prize winning academic research and best practices.
[01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:45.880]   It produces a great result, steady growth year over year over year.
[01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:47.040]   They monitor it.
[01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:51.280]   Look, best you're going to do is maybe every quarter, best your investment advisor.
[01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:55.560]   If you're lucky every month, more likely just right before he meets with you, this is better
[01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:56.560]   than that.
[01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:59.760]   They're a computer, so it's got nothing else to do.
[01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:06.520]   It's managing your investment minute by minute, maximizing for returns with the lowest tax
[01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:07.520]   consequences.
[01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:09.000]   It's called tax-lost harvesting.
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.000]   It's brilliant.
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000]   They're constantly readjusting.
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:13.240]   Make sure you're balanced.
[01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:16.960]   You're getting in the right sectors.
[01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:20.960]   We know this works because I hear from a lot of you listeners who have tried this, who
[01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:22.560]   are thrilled, and I think you'll be thrilled.
[01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:26.720]   But go and read up on it, wealthfront.com/macbreak.
[01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:30.120]   If you go there, you answer a couple of questions about your timeframe and how you feel about
[01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:31.120]   risk.
[01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:35.000]   They will generate a sample portfolio so you can see what it would be like, what they'd
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.360]   be investing in, so validate it.
[01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:40.920]   They'll even look at your existing portfolio and tell you if you're overpaying in fees,
[01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:43.080]   what's costing you, that kind of thing.
[01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:45.320]   That can be really an eye-opener as well.
[01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:49.080]   One of the things I like about this is you get a dashboard of all your investments, not
[01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:52.520]   just your investments through Wealthfront, but all your investments and all the places
[01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:56.840]   you've invested in so you can have a single dashboard where you see everything on your
[01:01:56.840 --> 01:01:59.680]   phone and your tablet, on the web, Wealthfront.
[01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:01.120]   This is a great way to do it.
[01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:02.720]   I want you to try it right now.
[01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:07.240]   No wonder they have $3 billion in money and management and it goes up all the time.
[01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:08.880]   It's very fast growing.
[01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:11.720]   Wealthfront.com/macbreak.
[01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:15.040]   And remember, just for Twit listeners, when you sign up to invest, they'll manage your
[01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:19.680]   first $15,000 free of charge forever.
[01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:22.320]   Wealthfront.com/macbreak.
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:24.200]   At least checking out.
[01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:28.080]   We thank them so much for their support and Mac break weekly and back we go to the boys
[01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:29.080]   and girls.
[01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:30.080]   Whoever.
[01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:31.080]   I don't know who's there.
[01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:32.080]   Hello.
[01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:35.600]   One of the other things that I thought was really cool about WWDC is Apple's continued
[01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:37.360]   focus on accessibility.
[01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:38.520]   It didn't just end with the keynote.
[01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:41.640]   We did get a lot of features there like Siri for Mac.
[01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:43.160]   There were some features they didn't talk about.
[01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:47.560]   In the iOS 10, you can now use the camera as a magnifying glass and you can shift colors
[01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:50.280]   if you have different visibility needs.
[01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:54.800]   But they also had continuous labs on accessibility across all of the platforms.
[01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:59.040]   And on the Wednesday, they had an accessibility meetup which was remarkable.
[01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:01.600]   I mean, a couple months ago, maybe it was just a month ago, Apple had it.
[01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:06.640]   They built an entire house inside one infinite loop inside the atrium where people from Apple
[01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:10.840]   could come and learn about all the technologies including Braille keyboards and Cochlear implants
[01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:14.680]   and Siri and HomeKit and all the super frameworks that they provide.
[01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:20.200]   And they did that on a smaller scale at WWDC where they had an area where the very talented
[01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:24.560]   Apple engineer who's blind and who did the DJing at the Apple Design Awards showed you
[01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:27.880]   sort of how he did the DJing with the DJ Pro app.
[01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:31.600]   And they had Cochlear implants you could put on your forehead and sort of feel how the
[01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:33.400]   bone connectivity worked.
[01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:36.080]   And they had various apps on display.
[01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:39.580]   They had the American Sign Language Association app and they were talking about how that
[01:03:39.580 --> 01:03:41.960]   was developed and sort of what you could learn from it.
[01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:49.040]   And I got to actually type with a Bluetooth keyboard to a Braille reader for the woman.
[01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:50.680]   And I'm going to blank on her name for a second.
[01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:55.560]   I just had it up here and I'll pull it up again who, Habin Girma, and I apologize if
[01:03:55.560 --> 01:04:00.240]   I'm mispronouncing that, who is blind and deaf and graduated from Harvard Law.
[01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:05.960]   But thanks to this sort of technology, she was not only at WWDC, but she spoke at WWDC.
[01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:07.400]   One of the best presentations ever.
[01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:11.380]   You just see her typing away and the presentation goes up and all of a sudden it's Obama who's
[01:04:11.380 --> 01:04:13.980]   talking to her, totally undersold it.
[01:04:13.980 --> 01:04:18.100]   But I find Apple's continued focus on accessibility, not just in the technologies, but giving
[01:04:18.100 --> 01:04:21.340]   it actual time on stage and on the floor.
[01:04:21.340 --> 01:04:25.060]   I hope that's something that becomes more competitive because I'm a firm believer that
[01:04:25.060 --> 01:04:29.660]   when you make things more accessible in general, you make them more accessible for everybody.
[01:04:29.660 --> 01:04:34.340]   And I think this is definitely not just a focus for Apple, but a very, very intense
[01:04:34.340 --> 01:04:35.580]   focus from Tim Cook.
[01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:38.280]   I think that this is coming from the top down.
[01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:40.600]   And I think that he's just very focused.
[01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:45.800]   I think that the more and more I watch after the years of after Steve Jobs, Steve Jobs got
[01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:50.820]   Apple to a certain point, but Tim Cook, I really feel is just an amazing next generation
[01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:55.500]   leader for Apple where he's paying attention to all those other little things that make
[01:04:55.500 --> 01:05:00.400]   a difference, whether it's accessibility in a lot of the political stances that Apple
[01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:03.520]   has decided to take one way or the other.
[01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:07.360]   But I think that he's very focused on it.
[01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:10.400]   And I think that accessibility is becoming a very important piece.
[01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:14.920]   And I think that Apple has been very good at being ahead of technology.
[01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:18.720]   And what I'm glad to see is that they're also ahead of things like accessibility.
[01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:20.360]   And they're setting the pace for everyone.
[01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:26.840]   I think that we're going to expect to see closed captioning and subtitling and everything
[01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:28.520]   else in the next couple of years.
[01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:29.520]   >> Scribe audio.
[01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:30.520]   >> Yeah.
[01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:39.440]   There's just so many parts of this that these WWDC canals are so useful because it's as
[01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:42.800]   simple and simple minded as a statement as the sounds.
[01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:45.820]   There is nothing in that keynote that they did not choose to put there.
[01:05:45.820 --> 01:05:51.280]   So it's super significant when they choose to spend so much time speaking in detail about
[01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:55.320]   accessibility features and people who have how they're going to make their technology
[01:05:55.320 --> 01:06:00.960]   accessible to people who have problems with vision and people who have problems with
[01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:06.600]   fine motor control and people who have problems with color perception.
[01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:12.360]   And it's not only are they talking about it because they feel as though this is as important
[01:06:12.360 --> 01:06:14.680]   as almost anything else that they're announcing that day.
[01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:20.360]   I think that they -- I wouldn't be surprised if they also acknowledge that this is something
[01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:23.120]   that they can be a leader at.
[01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:27.800]   And one way of defining leadership is getting their first and having the best solution and
[01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:29.400]   killing all the competition.
[01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:33.160]   But another aspect of the leader of being a leader is inspiring other people and putting
[01:06:33.160 --> 01:06:36.760]   their attention on something you feel that they should be paying attention to.
[01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:38.760]   And of course Apple is not the only company doing that.
[01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:43.840]   But I think that they're the company that's flying that flag as highly as they can.
[01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:48.360]   I mean, I brought my pick of the week which I might be burning right now because I have
[01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:51.520]   to because it's something that's relevant.
[01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:59.920]   The new Kindle reader has an actual special font selection for people who have dyslexia.
[01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:05.880]   So it basically -- to someone who does not have that problem reading, it looks like a
[01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:09.640]   very, very weird or stylistic or hippie sort of font.
[01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:14.320]   But it actually -- the things that tend to confuse the brain that has a problem in actually
[01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:17.160]   discriminating letters and forming them into words.
[01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:22.080]   It basically gets rid of those hacks that kind of -- putties in those cracks in the sidewalk
[01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:26.200]   that it is like a brain will trip over and makes it easier to create.
[01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:29.640]   And when you think about software, it costs a lot of money to develop.
[01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:37.080]   But it's not as though you have to buy up all the manufacturing capability of the world
[01:07:37.080 --> 01:07:41.240]   to fuse glass to this new kind of metal that you've created.
[01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:43.480]   It costs money to develop, but in the end it's just electrons.
[01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:47.840]   It costs nothing in the long run to add an extra font that makes this easier to use for
[01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:48.920]   other people.
[01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:55.360]   Just like the community that needs, again, interfaces that don't require quite such a
[01:07:55.360 --> 01:08:04.320]   precise touch or that require a mono output or require a lot of help for people with low
[01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:06.600]   vision, that's not a huge market.
[01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:08.760]   It's also not something they're going to get a lot of grant money for.
[01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:10.960]   It's not something they're going to get a big advertising hit for.
[01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:14.640]   There's not going to be a telethon in which Tim Cook and a big fluffy tuxedo was singing
[01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:19.040]   to a person with a bad low vision and trying to get sympathy for the company.
[01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:21.920]   It's just something that they feel is an important thing.
[01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:27.120]   And although, of course, one of my broken record things about Apple is that I wish that
[01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:33.080]   they would make devices that are more accessible to people who don't necessarily have the money
[01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:34.920]   to buy a luxury item.
[01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:39.080]   But that doesn't mean that they're not focused on trying to make it so that there's a few
[01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:44.600]   barriers as possible while they can still be Apple and still pursue their business
[01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:45.600]   plans.
[01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:47.600]   So bravo to them.
[01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:52.040]   Yeah, it's super interesting too because from everything, they had a nine-year-old
[01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:57.200]   developer there as part of the grant program and they had Swift Playgrounds, which we've
[01:08:57.200 --> 01:08:58.200]   seen more about now.
[01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:01.400]   And you can basically use the entire SDK right within Swift Playgrounds.
[01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:03.080]   It's not a traditional environment.
[01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:07.000]   You can't just burn iOS apps straight from there, but it lets you explore and play and
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:10.000]   it's got lesson plans and everything built into that.
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:14.680]   And we saw during State of the Union that Interface Builder, for example, an Xcode,
[01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:16.120]   has now got voiceover support.
[01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:21.120]   And it's just one feature after another that makes it not accessible only based on whether
[01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:25.360]   you have visual issues or auditory issues or motor skill issues, but your age, whether
[01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:29.360]   you've ever used a computer before, they're sort of making it so that you can onboard.
[01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:31.360]   And we talked about it before, not everyone needs to code.
[01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:35.200]   But if you do want to, it's now more approachable than ever.
[01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:41.560]   Well, I think that, for me, the most exciting thing in the keynote was Swift Playgrounds.
[01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:49.560]   So I think that it is, I'm actually going to start, I'm starting to put together a couple
[01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:53.960]   of iPads and so on and so forth with my kids to actually have code nights where we're just
[01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:57.720]   going to play with doing some of these bits and pieces and see how far we can go with
[01:09:57.720 --> 01:09:58.720]   it.
[01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:03.440]   I think that when you talk about wanting code to be something that everyone at least understands
[01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:07.800]   to some degree, whether they become coders or not, I think it's super exciting.
[01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:12.600]   I think that the things that I got really excited about weren't necessarily in the keynote,
[01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:18.760]   but as you saw more of the sessions come out were the Swift Playgrounds book creation.
[01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:22.200]   So you can, if you're a teacher, because I looked at these and I was like, "Okay, that's
[01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:24.800]   really great," but the kids are going to run out of these.
[01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:27.920]   When you look at the examples that they showed during the keynote, you're like, "Okay, that's
[01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:31.560]   cute, but that'll take two weeks and then there won't be anything left."
[01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:36.120]   Well, it turns out that anybody can develop these code bases.
[01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:39.480]   So teachers can build their own, you can build them for adults.
[01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:43.160]   As you said, the entire, the Swift library is all there.
[01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:46.520]   You can build anything and then if you decide that you want to turn it into something that
[01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:49.960]   you're going to assign and put make available, it's just moving into Xcode.
[01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:51.880]   It's not like you have to give that up.
[01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:56.120]   Your playground becomes the where, the factory.
[01:10:56.120 --> 01:11:01.400]   So I just think that for many people wanting to get into code or having their kids get
[01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:02.560]   into code, this is probably it.
[01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:08.560]   I think that in conjunction with it being made, opened so that anybody can use Swift
[01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:13.560]   for their development program and the fact that if you're a school, you'd be nuts to
[01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:16.520]   kind of nuts to use anything else at this point.
[01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:21.080]   I think that you're going to get into a situation where 10 or 15 or 20 years of Apple plays this
[01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:22.080]   right.
[01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:28.080]   I think that Swift is the fact-o language that almost everything's written in.
[01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:33.520]   Yeah, I love it because especially in this articulation of it, it becomes a program
[01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:35.320]   language you can just screw around with.
[01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:36.320]   Yeah.
[01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:41.080]   One of the difficulties, I mean, Objective-C was probably my fifth, sixth, seventh, maybe
[01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:43.360]   eighth programming language that I learned.
[01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:48.360]   But it really reminded me of the one time that I played Dungeons and Dragons where it's
[01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:53.520]   like I want to have a sword in my hand and I want to fight dragons or I want to have the
[01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:57.160]   magical staff that, it's fire.
[01:11:57.160 --> 01:12:02.040]   Bob, you're having me at a table here with lots of paperwork and making calculations
[01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:03.720]   and filling out forms.
[01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:09.080]   This is not as fun as fighting a dragon and learning how to program in a highly structured
[01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:13.560]   objective language really is all we're going to try to do is try to print the words "Hello
[01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:14.560]   world."
[01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:16.360]   Now, first of all, you have to understand how this editor works.
[01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:17.720]   Here's what Emacs works.
[01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:20.560]   And by the way, no, no, no, you can't just simply give it a command.
[01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:24.400]   You have to load in the library that has all the stuff that will allow it to actually
[01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:25.400]   print something out of the.
[01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:29.800]   Now, here's our, and it's like, I really just want to say hello world and I want to go over
[01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:31.880]   and over again like an Apple soft basic.
[01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:35.160]   But and the ability to not only just here is a command and here's the result of that
[01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:39.400]   command on the other side of the screen, not only that, but here is a dragon.
[01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:43.560]   Here's how you make the dragon bounce up and down and how about if I have a, I want it
[01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:44.560]   to start and stop.
[01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:48.200]   So I'll have a start button and a stop button and it will have it a slider so I can make
[01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:50.360]   it go faster or slower.
[01:12:50.360 --> 01:12:53.200]   And as these ideas occur to you, you can just screw around with it.
[01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:54.400]   And that's the best way to learn anything.
[01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:56.840]   And you're in a safe, you're in a safe playground, right?
[01:12:56.840 --> 01:13:00.400]   You know, where you don't have to build all those structures, you know, so that you get
[01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:03.000]   used to the language and then when you're going to, when you're going to actually open
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:08.920]   up Xcode, now you're, you're learning a couple of big boxes, but you don't have to the, the,
[01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:13.680]   I think Xcode requires you to learn almost too much at one time for a kid to learn it.
[01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:16.680]   You know, I think that I would have had, you know, I started writing code when I was
[01:13:16.680 --> 01:13:21.520]   10, but I was writing basic, you know, and I, and I think that, I think that I couldn't
[01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:26.360]   imagine starting Xcode, maybe I could have, but I don't expect that I would have started.
[01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:28.800]   I've seen examples of you were very, very clever boy.
[01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:32.440]   Well, one of the really cool things about this too is it's got replay kit built in.
[01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:37.360]   So you can actually record and stream like the way you would Minecraft or the way you
[01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:38.480]   would video games.
[01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:40.800]   You can actually, and people can watch you do it.
[01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:45.000]   And I know my, my God, because they love to watch videos while they're playing video
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:46.000]   games.
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:47.880]   It's, it's just a thing that, that kid seems to do.
[01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:49.360]   And that's all built right into this too.
[01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:53.360]   So hopefully coding can become, I don't know, is that a possibility that coding it become
[01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:56.480]   as cool as playing video games or working in Minecraft?
[01:13:56.480 --> 01:13:57.480]   Well, hopefully.
[01:13:57.480 --> 01:14:01.720]   I mean, you know, I think that, you know, I, my, my son has an unlimited ability to watch
[01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:09.480]   Minecraft videos, you know, and so, but I, but I think that I think that there is this
[01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:13.920]   moment where people turn to being able to make stuff themselves and that, that makes
[01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:15.880]   consumption less interesting.
[01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:19.040]   You know, I think I spent most of my childhood building stuff.
[01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:21.960]   You know, I didn't really, you know, partially that a lot of that content wasn't there.
[01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:25.960]   Like when I got an Apple to E, the, there weren't a lot of applications that you could
[01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:28.960]   buy and the ones that were there were all 40 or 50 bucks, which would be, you know, a
[01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:30.840]   month of work when I was a kid.
[01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:34.840]   So, you know, so I wrote everything, you know, that I was, that everything my computer did,
[01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:37.360]   I wrote, I had to write code to do that.
[01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:44.280]   I think that I think that the, but when you start realizing that you can build it, you
[01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:47.680]   know, from scratch, I think that that's very addicting.
[01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:52.400]   Yeah, I mean, when you don't have to, I think the way to learn any skill and certainly the
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:57.000]   way to teach any skill is not yours, your coursework and yours are your lab work and
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:58.560]   I'm going to start off with history.
[01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:01.280]   Computer, see the world in a series of months and zeros.
[01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:03.800]   We call this the binomial theorem.
[01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:08.280]   It's, it's basically you, well, you sit, sit the kid down or whoever it is and say,
[01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:10.320]   what do you want this computer to do?
[01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:13.080]   Like, well, I, I want to see a bouncing dragon.
[01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:15.480]   Okay, let's figure out how to draw a dragon.
[01:15:15.480 --> 01:15:19.120]   And every time you want to do something, figure out how to do that.
[01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:22.840]   There's the greatest thing about, about that video that they showed during WWDC is it really
[01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:29.640]   would point out that in many cases, the demographic that is least capable of bringing the art
[01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:33.960]   of programming forward are people who've been writing software for 30, 40 years.
[01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:38.400]   The people who can really have the insight to create the next immense thing is someone
[01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:43.840]   who just want who just, they're, they're a nurse on, on, on award and they figure out
[01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:44.840]   there.
[01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:47.720]   It's when things go wrong that go wrong in a really predictable fashion.
[01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:52.760]   I, I wish there were an easy way to keep records of when things go wrong and then we can visualize
[01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:55.040]   how well, how poorly those things work.
[01:15:55.040 --> 01:16:00.640]   And because they are, they've been doing nothing but from 10 p.m. and to, to 7 a.m.
[01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:01.640]   Saving human lives.
[01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:05.640]   And also when there are 45 minutes where nothing's happening, thinking about this problem, all
[01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:07.960]   they need to do, any, you can teach anybody how to code.
[01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:09.920]   You can't necessarily teach anybody.
[01:16:09.920 --> 01:16:13.560]   Here is what an end of life, word care on, in a cancer unit.
[01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:17.560]   You're with, with their particular problems are they, that's the only person who can write
[01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:19.560]   their, that, that piece of software.
[01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:24.160]   And just for the same reason why it's easier to teach an astronaut how to be a geologist
[01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:26.240]   than to train a geologist to be an astronaut.
[01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:30.320]   That's why they're only shipped one geologist and all those missions and they instead put
[01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:33.360]   all those astronauts through, through the, through the rock camp.
[01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:34.360]   Right.
[01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:35.360]   Yeah.
[01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:40.840]   And I think that, I think that figuring that out, I, when I, we build a lot of education
[01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:45.200]   stuff and we call it, what we tend to call that is a dessert first training.
[01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:48.000]   You know, I'm not going to make, I'm not going to make you have the Brussels sprouts first.
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:49.240]   I'm not going to make you have it.
[01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:53.000]   Let's do something like when I was teaching kids out a model, I don't teach them how to,
[01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.240]   you know, I don't talk about bullying functions or anything else.
[01:16:55.240 --> 01:16:56.240]   I'm like, okay, here's the deal.
[01:16:56.240 --> 01:16:57.240]   We're going to stretch all that.
[01:16:57.240 --> 01:16:59.360]   We're going to take this little box and we're going to stretch it until it looks like a
[01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:02.840]   mean fish with big teeth and big eyes and then, you know, and then they think that's
[01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:03.840]   great.
[01:17:03.840 --> 01:17:05.840]   And then after that, we can go, but we can go back to the boring stuff, but let's do something
[01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:07.880]   really fun first.
[01:17:07.880 --> 01:17:11.680]   And I think that what playgrounds let you do is you can build it all around so they can
[01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:15.560]   do a couple of things and then it's really, you know, they get, they get that feedback
[01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:21.480]   quickly, you know, and, and I, one thing I'm hoping to do, you know, relatively quickly
[01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:24.560]   is start tying it in with things like little bits and, you know, other things like that
[01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:27.680]   because you use the Wi-Fi stuff that they have there and be able to, you know, have the
[01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:31.920]   kids understand they can interact between the iPad and the, and the, and the little bits.
[01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:36.480]   And I think that those are the kind of things that I, those, those are the building blocks,
[01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:42.280]   I think of, of building potential makers that, that, you know, I don't care if the kids become
[01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:46.760]   engineers or anything else like that, but having them feel like, like my daughter who's,
[01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:49.520]   you know, six, I want her to feel like, you know, she's, if she wants to build something
[01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:53.240]   for what she's doing, she can sit down and code away at something and build something
[01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:56.520]   that's going to, that's going to produce something for whatever she's designing.
[01:17:56.520 --> 01:18:00.600]   And think about how difficult, one of the core difficulties as you transition through
[01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:06.440]   childhood into adulthood is coming to grips with the horror, the fact that you have happened
[01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:10.200]   absolutely no control over this whole world that this world is around you.
[01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:14.560]   You have big, two big grownups that are telling you you're going to school at this time when
[01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:17.400]   you get to school for eight hours, other grownups tell you you're going to, you're going to
[01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:21.360]   go dodge balls for, for an hour, you're going to do math, you're going to do this, and then
[01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:24.520]   you're told we're going to go on vacation, you're going to told, you have no control
[01:18:24.520 --> 01:18:25.520]   over anything.
[01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:31.520]   And whether you are learning how to code or whether you are deciding that I've, when
[01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:35.600]   I'm studying, I just want, I need to have like a low table next to my desk so I can
[01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:39.160]   put like my soda down, I'm not going to tip it over onto my thing.
[01:18:39.160 --> 01:18:44.600]   The first time that a kid learns that you can make that table and you can solve that
[01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:48.920]   problem or now you can, here's this box in the case of a Raspberry Pi, this little,
[01:18:48.920 --> 01:18:52.920]   slav, this little index card that costs $35 that will do exactly anything that you tell
[01:18:52.920 --> 01:18:58.160]   it to do, limited only by the amount of work you're willing to do to, to build the thing.
[01:18:58.160 --> 01:19:04.280]   That is such a beautiful warping of the mind and giving that kid the skills are going to
[01:19:04.280 --> 01:19:07.880]   need to cope with everything, that there are things you can't control, but here's things
[01:19:07.880 --> 01:19:08.880]   you can make.
[01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:11.640]   You can, you don't have to simply be a consumer, you can be a producer of things.
[01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:14.880]   Yeah, and I think, but so I think that it'll be interesting to see, I think that the, the
[01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:18.600]   one thing that will be a challenge, I think for Apple is just making sure that the support
[01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:22.040]   materials that go out are, are there because I think that, that was one of the things when
[01:19:22.040 --> 01:19:25.360]   you look at iBooks, when you look at Apple, we'll throw things out there and go, well,
[01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:26.360]   then we expect people to do it.
[01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:27.360]   You're welcome.
[01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:28.360]   You're welcome.
[01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:29.360]   We have done it for you now.
[01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:31.800]   Although this was a, this was essentially a one more thing at Aquino.
[01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:34.280]   So I think this probably has a lot more top down support.
[01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:43.320]   But if you looked at the, the line for that, for the, the, the playground, actual session,
[01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:44.760]   it was, I saw the pictures.
[01:19:44.760 --> 01:19:45.760]   Yeah.
[01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:50.080]   I was like, a couple, a couple, other than us, like a couple of people did get how big
[01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:51.080]   of a deal it was.
[01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:54.520]   I was not embarrassed to say that when, when Swift was introduced, before I checked out
[01:19:54.520 --> 01:19:59.000]   of my hotel, for my flight home, of course I had the big PDF of describing the language
[01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:03.000]   and I read about half of it before we, before I actually got home.
[01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:06.640]   And I was a good boy and I started playing around with it.
[01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:10.800]   And I didn't really get that far, not because it was complicated, but because, you know,
[01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:11.800]   interests were tailed up.
[01:20:11.800 --> 01:20:15.600]   I'm not embarrassed to admit that I'm, I'm going to get this app and I'm going to, I
[01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:20.440]   want to make the Mr. Hoppy Bunny go to the top of the tree and count the number of apples
[01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:24.800]   and not just, I'm going to, I'm going to learn how to program and Swift with this ostensibly
[01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:29.760]   kids app and I believe that I'm not going to be a minority demographic user.
[01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:32.120]   Well, why do you think I'm doing code night with my kids?
[01:20:32.120 --> 01:20:37.760]   I mean, it's like, I've been like, I've been looking at like no parent left behind.
[01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:39.520]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:42.480]   The clipping on my viewport is going wrong.
[01:20:42.480 --> 01:20:46.600]   Do I need to have the, the, the, the center of the station?
[01:20:46.600 --> 01:20:47.960]   It's like, it's like, I want to negotiate.
[01:20:47.960 --> 01:20:49.600]   You find, you can't do that by yourself.
[01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:50.600]   You have to take your kids.
[01:20:50.600 --> 01:20:52.240]   You see our programming for the next generation.
[01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:53.240]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:20:53.240 --> 01:20:58.360]   So sort of the last thing that I wanted to get into is once again, rumors about the iPhone
[01:20:58.360 --> 01:21:03.200]   seven, this time from the Wall Street Journal, no less that it's going to be like, you know,
[01:21:03.200 --> 01:21:04.200]   we saw this with Intel.
[01:21:04.200 --> 01:21:07.120]   They used to be tick, tick, tick, and now this year it's tick, talk, talk.
[01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:11.760]   Apple used to be tick, talk, tick, talk, an internal improvement followed by a new redesign.
[01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:15.680]   And this year it looks like we got the new redesign with the six, the six S was the new
[01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:18.920]   internals and maybe it'll be called the seven.
[01:21:18.920 --> 01:21:20.240]   Maybe it'll be called something else.
[01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:26.080]   It'll be another sort of more iterative design, you know, absent 3.5 millimeter headphone
[01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:27.080]   jack.
[01:21:27.080 --> 01:21:30.760]   Alex, is this, is this a reality of when technology matures to a certain rate that it becomes hard
[01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:32.480]   and harder to push them forward?
[01:21:32.480 --> 01:21:37.240]   Well, I think they just have to decide what, you know, what's new, you know, what, what
[01:21:37.240 --> 01:21:38.880]   they, you know, there, there are technologies.
[01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:42.880]   I think they're definitely there that they could be adding that, you know, things like
[01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:46.440]   stereo photography, things like stereo photography.
[01:21:46.440 --> 01:21:48.880]   They were just thinking about stereo photography.
[01:21:48.880 --> 01:21:49.880]   HDR.
[01:21:49.880 --> 01:21:50.880]   HDR is fine.
[01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:52.720]   Yeah, I think HDR be great.
[01:21:52.720 --> 01:21:54.520]   I think that the cameras do H.G.O.
[01:21:54.520 --> 01:21:55.520]   We found that out.
[01:21:55.520 --> 01:21:57.880]   They do deep colored on the iPhone 6S cameras already.
[01:21:57.880 --> 01:21:58.880]   Right.
[01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:02.080]   Well, and I would love to see, I mean, I don't mind.
[01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:03.800]   I would love to see my, the phone get.
[01:22:03.800 --> 01:22:07.760]   I mean, I have to, but I still use almost every day.
[01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:11.720]   I probably still still use the DxO because I like, I like to have the larger chip size
[01:22:11.720 --> 01:22:14.960]   and you get used to that, that look and you go, we really cool.
[01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:19.040]   That was just built into the phone, but it would make the phone very clunky.
[01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:24.520]   But anyway, but, but I think that, that things like that, I think that we're going to see
[01:22:24.520 --> 01:22:25.520]   more interaction.
[01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:28.360]   I don't, I think that they'll add a lot of interesting things.
[01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:33.560]   I don't think Apple has to add, for them, it's not how to blow the, you know, doors
[01:22:33.560 --> 01:22:34.560]   off.
[01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:39.760]   I think that for them, the challenge is really, how do I, how do we add enough features that
[01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:46.000]   people, not the last version, but the version before that decide they need to get an upgrade.
[01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:49.000]   Do you have a preference?
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.440]   Like if they do go to two cameras, do you have a preference?
[01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:55.360]   Like if they do a regular lens and a wide angle lens or regular lens and a black and
[01:22:55.360 --> 01:23:00.120]   white that pulls more detail for low light, is there sort of an ideal for you?
[01:23:00.120 --> 01:23:05.120]   So I had a, the, I still carry it with me actually.
[01:23:05.120 --> 01:23:11.280]   I have a Fuji, the WS2 or WS3 or whatever, which is the stereo camera.
[01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:15.140]   It's got two, you know, it's got, I still take pictures of it because I, you know, I'm
[01:23:15.140 --> 01:23:19.640]   working on an app that, so anyway, so, but I still take pictures with it all the time.
[01:23:19.640 --> 01:23:23.720]   Anything interesting I have, I'm kind of like the, so the three things that I'm constantly
[01:23:23.720 --> 01:23:29.320]   carrying around as I have this, the Fuji WS2 and then I have my DXO and then I have a
[01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:30.320]   Theta.
[01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:33.400]   And so anytime you can always tell everything, I think something's really interesting because
[01:23:33.400 --> 01:23:34.680]   there's like three cameras that come out.
[01:23:34.680 --> 01:23:35.680]   I don't have any big cameras.
[01:23:35.680 --> 01:23:37.720]   I just have these little cameras in my pocket and I pull them out and take a whole bunch
[01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:38.720]   of different photos.
[01:23:38.720 --> 01:23:43.880]   And, but, you know, I'd love to see two, you know, two cameras that are, I think that
[01:23:43.880 --> 01:23:49.220]   when you look at where Apple may go with augmented reality or virtual reality or whatever, you
[01:23:49.220 --> 01:23:50.580]   know, there's a lot of opportunities there.
[01:23:50.580 --> 01:23:53.700]   And it's not just that you take stereographic photos.
[01:23:53.700 --> 01:23:57.180]   Once you have enough parallax between those lenses, you're talking about recreating the
[01:23:57.180 --> 01:24:00.700]   world around you and doing all kinds of other things because you can, you know, triangulate
[01:24:00.700 --> 01:24:03.220]   the position of pixels, you know, out in front of you.
[01:24:03.220 --> 01:24:08.780]   And so there's a lot of, you know, I think interesting things that are, you know, available
[01:24:08.780 --> 01:24:13.020]   to gathering that kind of information, which could be the tango phones.
[01:24:13.020 --> 01:24:14.020]   Yeah.
[01:24:14.020 --> 01:24:15.020]   Yeah.
[01:24:15.020 --> 01:24:16.020]   Yeah.
[01:24:16.020 --> 01:24:19.880]   I think I think as far as photography is concerned, it's kind of starting to become a mug's game
[01:24:19.880 --> 01:24:22.720]   to try to, hey, we've got this immense new sensor.
[01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:28.240]   We've got this great new lens because that's not terribly relevant because the best quality
[01:24:28.240 --> 01:24:32.800]   pictures you get from a phone are it collects a series of numbers from the sensor and then
[01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:34.880]   does a lot of great number crunching for it.
[01:24:34.880 --> 01:24:35.880]   That's a lot.
[01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:39.920]   There's so much that goes on with the behind the scenes of an Apple, of an iPhone camera,
[01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:44.480]   it is actually taking a series of four pictures and then combining the sharpest picture, the
[01:24:44.480 --> 01:24:46.240]   sharpest parts of each one of them.
[01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:49.640]   And because it's all happening so fast, it looks like it's just exposing, exposing the
[01:24:49.640 --> 01:24:50.640]   shutter.
[01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:58.240]   I would took a, there's a picture on my Instagram of a beautiful, like, full moon under just
[01:24:58.240 --> 01:25:02.760]   dots of silvery, like puffs of clouds, it brings partly backlit by it.
[01:25:02.760 --> 01:25:06.800]   I was just walking along like Harvard Avenue and Brookline and just had it.
[01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:11.480]   All I had was like my little next, not even a premium phone, like a Nexus 5X.
[01:25:11.480 --> 01:25:15.920]   But I know enough about technique that said, normally, even with my iPhone, I would take
[01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:19.320]   a picture and it would be so cruddy with noise, it would be unusable.
[01:25:19.320 --> 01:25:23.840]   But I realized that, oh, if I put it into high speed mode and just take like a series
[01:25:23.840 --> 01:25:31.200]   of pictures, I took a series of 12 and then he was a technique called stacking that basically
[01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:36.000]   you load them all into Photoshop and you tell Photoshop that whatever dots are the same
[01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:41.760]   and all of these, first align these so that they're the same image.
[01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:46.560]   But then any dot that is different from one dot to another, throw that dot away, that
[01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:51.480]   means that basically all the random noise doesn't go away completely, but it almost
[01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:52.520]   goes away.
[01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:55.200]   And then that's stuff you can do immediately.
[01:25:55.200 --> 01:25:59.880]   In terms of what Apple has to do, unfortunately, they're starting to run out of ways to get
[01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:05.520]   people excited about the new piece of hardware because it's damn near perfect.
[01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:11.280]   And now there's just waiting on is someone going to make a 60 megapixel sensor that meets
[01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:13.840]   Apple specifications.
[01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:16.840]   And 3D Touch was a big deal.
[01:26:16.840 --> 01:26:19.400]   If you have 3D Touch, you have ample reason to love it.
[01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:22.400]   You'll have more reason to love it with the next version of the iOS.
[01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:24.480]   Did they train us to wait for the redesign Andy?
[01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:25.480]   Did they like get us on this?
[01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:28.880]   Like, I feel like with Intel, it was like TikTok, TikTok, they trained us to wait for
[01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:32.160]   the next architecture and Apple trained us to wait for the next redesign.
[01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:35.920]   It's like, are you going to buy the S model or are you going to wait for the redesign?
[01:26:35.920 --> 01:26:40.160]   And now people are preemptively disappointed that it's not going to be a joke, like a triangle
[01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:41.160]   or something.
[01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:42.160]   You know what?
[01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:43.160]   I was ready to buy another one.
[01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:45.160]   All the Samsungs look the same.
[01:26:45.160 --> 01:26:47.600]   Like phones, we're getting to a point where phone is a phone, they've come to sort of
[01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:48.600]   an ideal shape.
[01:26:48.600 --> 01:26:50.560]   See, that's the other problem that.
[01:26:50.560 --> 01:26:53.320]   So this is the OnePlus.
[01:26:53.320 --> 01:27:01.920]   Again, manufacturers of software and services and hardware give a plain English or a simple
[01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:04.600]   name that I can say without having to specify.
[01:27:04.600 --> 01:27:06.520]   This is called the OnePlus 3.
[01:27:06.520 --> 01:27:08.360]   The name of the company is OnePlus.
[01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:13.120]   And then this is the 3, the third version of the phone they have made.
[01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:18.680]   And this is, there is, I swear to God, I've been using this for the past couple of weeks.
[01:27:18.680 --> 01:27:24.320]   And I take off the really cool bamboo case that I kind of like, so you can see the build
[01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:26.160]   quality.
[01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:29.440]   And please ignore the sticker that I've left on it.
[01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:35.640]   But if you hold this in your hand and you hold like an iPhone 6 in your hand, you really
[01:27:35.640 --> 01:27:44.880]   can't, I can't objectively say that the iPhone 6s is built better than this phone is.
[01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:49.200]   It's got the same CPU as Samsung's flagship CPU.
[01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:53.400]   It has more system memory so that app switching is going to be faster.
[01:27:53.400 --> 01:27:57.720]   It has a 16 megapixel camera that takes fantastically good pictures.
[01:27:57.720 --> 01:27:58.960]   It's super, super fast.
[01:27:58.960 --> 01:28:01.080]   It has 64 gigs of RAM.
[01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:04.760]   And it goes for $399, $399.
[01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:10.960]   It also has a fingerprint reader that's as fast as what's on the iPhone.
[01:28:10.960 --> 01:28:18.000]   I'll be damned if I can figure out what Apple, in terms of holding a physical device.
[01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:24.160]   The day is done where you can say, oh well, it's nice that the Nexus 5X costs only $350.
[01:28:24.160 --> 01:28:28.480]   But you can see that they went for a plastic body and it's not optical image.
[01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:38.800]   Apple's big problem is that people who are not necessarily going to the car store knowing
[01:28:38.800 --> 01:28:42.960]   exactly what the displacement of this engine is, what the performance is on the denominator.
[01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:50.000]   People who come in, I want a phone that does A, B, C, D, E. And I want it to feel good in
[01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:51.160]   my hand.
[01:28:51.160 --> 01:28:55.400]   You put this in their hand and you put the iPhone in their hand and then-
[01:28:55.400 --> 01:28:58.520]   Well, I think that the iPhone costs $200 more.
[01:28:58.520 --> 01:29:02.040]   I think a lot of people are going to ask, why does the iPhone cost $200 more than this?
[01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:07.640]   When the camera has lower megapixels and actually takes pictures that are not necessarily better
[01:29:07.640 --> 01:29:09.160]   at A, B, C, and D.
[01:29:09.160 --> 01:29:14.440]   Well, I think that one of the things becomes, for a lot of these updates for Apple, it is
[01:29:14.440 --> 01:29:19.520]   a little bit defensive as well as offensive, which is that you got to make sure, obviously,
[01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:25.040]   one of Apple's biggest quarters ever was when they released a larger phone because that
[01:29:25.040 --> 01:29:30.240]   sold- that Apple in a lot of ways just to keep on maintaining the momentum needs to
[01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:36.480]   constantly put out phones that have an equivalent to the Android world because a lot of us are
[01:29:36.480 --> 01:29:40.880]   tied into the ecosystem with thousands of dollars of apps.
[01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:49.080]   It's hard whether you're on Android or on an iPhone to switch because you've- and I will
[01:29:49.080 --> 01:29:52.720]   argue that it's probably harder to go from an iPhone to an Android because you've probably
[01:29:52.720 --> 01:29:56.520]   spent more money on apps just because of the nature of the ecosystem.
[01:29:56.520 --> 01:30:00.640]   Not because it's just that there's a lot more free apps and everything else on an Android
[01:30:00.640 --> 01:30:04.960]   that you can go, "Well, I didn't spend this and this and this and this on it.
[01:30:04.960 --> 01:30:06.800]   It's a little easier to walk away from."
[01:30:06.800 --> 01:30:13.360]   But I think that there's- if people feel like they're generally getting that return,
[01:30:13.360 --> 01:30:14.320]   I think that becomes important.
[01:30:14.320 --> 01:30:20.120]   I think that we are going to expect to see even higher resolution on the screen, not
[01:30:20.120 --> 01:30:24.680]   because we're not because we're necessarily needed when we're looking at it a way.
[01:30:24.680 --> 01:30:27.920]   But I do think eventually Apple's going to have to pay attention to VR.
[01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:30.840]   VR puts a whole different requirement on phones.
[01:30:30.840 --> 01:30:37.960]   So now a 4K phone is just barely enough because each eye, what you're competing with when
[01:30:37.960 --> 01:30:45.320]   you look at a crescent bay, Oculus, is that it's capable of very high resolution and
[01:30:45.320 --> 01:30:50.360]   phones are trying to get- there's a processing speed as well as display quality that's going
[01:30:50.360 --> 01:30:54.600]   to get you towards some kind of cardboard solution using that app.
[01:30:54.600 --> 01:30:58.080]   That's not the perfect solution, but there's a lot of momentum.
[01:30:58.080 --> 01:31:02.360]   And I don't think that VR is a 3D fad.
[01:31:02.360 --> 01:31:03.360]   I think that-
[01:31:03.360 --> 01:31:04.360]   Yeah.
[01:31:04.360 --> 01:31:08.680]   Especially because it demos so well and there are other places.
[01:31:08.680 --> 01:31:09.680]   We talk about it.
[01:31:09.680 --> 01:31:14.560]   I think that it would be really exciting to have two cameras on an iPhone or any phone,
[01:31:14.560 --> 01:31:18.800]   not because of 3D, but for the ability to take a panorama of a room and now I have a
[01:31:18.800 --> 01:31:20.400]   3D map of the room.
[01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:24.000]   And now I can not only- not just, "Hey, look, I'm in the room, but I'm now looking at the
[01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:25.160]   fake version of the room."
[01:31:25.160 --> 01:31:28.440]   I'm saying that I'm putting a sofa there and I'm going to figure out, "Well, here's
[01:31:28.440 --> 01:31:31.320]   what- I've been thinking about putting a window right there.
[01:31:31.320 --> 01:31:34.440]   What would- what would morning light look like if I put a window right there?"
[01:31:34.440 --> 01:31:36.360]   And it's doing all that sort of stuff in real time.
[01:31:36.360 --> 01:31:41.760]   All that has to happen is Magic Leap becomes something that is affordable.
[01:31:41.760 --> 01:31:48.400]   With one God- God love you if one of your kids' friends has it because then every kid is
[01:31:48.400 --> 01:31:49.440]   going to want to have it.
[01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:50.920]   And not only that, but every parent.
[01:31:50.920 --> 01:31:54.000]   Just like the first wave of home computers.
[01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:59.480]   Like all the- the- you know, little trial fads he just wants to Magic Leap for-
[01:31:59.480 --> 01:32:01.640]   you know, like, you know, if that's all he wants to-
[01:32:01.640 --> 01:32:03.520]   Or the upcoming PlayStation VR.
[01:32:03.520 --> 01:32:04.520]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:32:04.520 --> 01:32:08.560]   I mean, if my Oculus arrived yesterday morning and Georgia Dow had stolen it by yesterday
[01:32:08.560 --> 01:32:09.560]   evening.
[01:32:09.560 --> 01:32:12.600]   So that's- that's not what I'm telling that technology is.
[01:32:12.600 --> 01:32:14.800]   But it's not as simple as Google.
[01:32:14.800 --> 01:32:18.960]   I think that you can do Oculus and you can do Google Cardboard where you do it kind of
[01:32:18.960 --> 01:32:23.080]   perfectly and then you do it $15 and of course you'll accept that there's- it doesn't work
[01:32:23.080 --> 01:32:24.800]   as well as something professional.
[01:32:24.800 --> 01:32:29.680]   It's difficult when you decide to take a 4K phone and try to make it suitable for VR.
[01:32:29.680 --> 01:32:36.280]   A lot of the Samsung 4K devices that work with a Gear VR, they have thermal problems
[01:32:36.280 --> 01:32:41.960]   where keeping all those sensors lit up, keeping the screen lit up and also keeping it like
[01:32:41.960 --> 01:32:44.600]   pressed against the person's face.
[01:32:44.600 --> 01:32:48.240]   It'll give you- it'll give you 25 minutes and then it's not that something bad will happen.
[01:32:48.240 --> 01:32:49.960]   But we'll say, "Oh, well, guess what?
[01:32:49.960 --> 01:32:53.920]   The Glinda the Good Witch has teleported you out of the glen and put you- you know what?
[01:32:53.920 --> 01:32:57.880]   And just for the VR, why don't you stick your head or inside the freezer compartment of
[01:32:57.880 --> 01:32:58.880]   your- which is-
[01:32:58.880 --> 01:33:01.520]   Which is also why I think that- that Cardboard has worked out really well in some respects
[01:33:01.520 --> 01:33:03.360]   because you're not strapping it to your head.
[01:33:03.360 --> 01:33:07.080]   Cardboard is really designed as I'm going to experience a moment.
[01:33:07.080 --> 01:33:09.880]   I'm not going to necessarily watch a whole film with it.
[01:33:09.880 --> 01:33:18.760]   I'm going to see what it's like to be in South Africa or see what it's like to be go back
[01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:20.920]   in history or be inside the body or whatever.
[01:33:20.920 --> 01:33:24.280]   And when you think of it as an educational program, I think those things are interesting.
[01:33:24.280 --> 01:33:29.800]   Well, it's successful in the way the 3D television could not be successful because VR, the way
[01:33:29.800 --> 01:33:35.280]   that it's being expressed and articulated through phones, is applicable in any creative way
[01:33:35.280 --> 01:33:39.240]   that a sufficiently creative person wants to articulate it.
[01:33:39.240 --> 01:33:44.160]   I would- the first time I used Gear VR, I was- okay, well, I'm really into gaming, but
[01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:48.520]   I'm sure it must be fun and okay, hey, an h- documentary where the start goes, you know,
[01:33:48.520 --> 01:33:49.520]   goes right over here.
[01:33:49.520 --> 01:33:50.680]   Okay, that's kind of cool.
[01:33:50.680 --> 01:33:58.600]   I thought the most boring and I finally got around to trying out Oculus Cinema thinking
[01:33:58.600 --> 01:34:03.280]   that, okay, we have an MP4 file on the phone and it'll play in the fake movie theater,
[01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:04.280]   but I'll be damned.
[01:34:04.280 --> 01:34:07.440]   It's like I was spending so much time in that fake theater because-
[01:34:07.440 --> 01:34:08.440]   I'm sure-
[01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:10.440]   It was so quiet and there was nobody there.
[01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:13.520]   Tim Baharan was saying it only watches Netflix on the HTC Vive.
[01:34:13.520 --> 01:34:15.720]   It's only experience he likes anymore.
[01:34:15.720 --> 01:34:19.360]   It's not only that, but like 1776 is one of my favorite movies.
[01:34:19.360 --> 01:34:22.200]   And of course, I've got the Blu-ray widescreen that's been ripped.
[01:34:22.200 --> 01:34:28.000]   Of course, it was released in 1972 where the way that they separate themselves from a movie,
[01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.720]   the television is we're going to be the big widescreen format.
[01:34:30.720 --> 01:34:36.000]   And I've seen it like a thousand times, but always on TV and always on phones and stuff.
[01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.600]   This was the first time I've quote, seen it in a theater.
[01:34:38.600 --> 01:34:42.640]   And that's when I realized it's because the theater experience is so precise.
[01:34:42.640 --> 01:34:47.960]   You are in a seat, there is ambience and there's a huge like 60 foot screen in front
[01:34:47.960 --> 01:34:48.960]   of you.
[01:34:48.960 --> 01:34:53.160]   That's the first time I appreciated the way that a director set up that shot.
[01:34:53.160 --> 01:34:59.640]   We're not meant to see here is John Adams, here is Thomas Jefferson and here is Ben Franklin.
[01:34:59.640 --> 01:35:03.560]   All you're looking at at the same time, you're meant to be going from like this to this,
[01:35:03.560 --> 01:35:07.760]   looking at the conversation between Jefferson and Adams and in your peripheral vision, you
[01:35:07.760 --> 01:35:11.560]   see that, oh, well, there's Ben Franklin like a sleet on the back there.
[01:35:11.560 --> 01:35:14.400]   And I felt like I was seeing it for the first time that way.
[01:35:14.400 --> 01:35:18.280]   And I was taking your seats and the popcorn was falling and the person was shouting at
[01:35:18.280 --> 01:35:19.960]   the screen next to you.
[01:35:19.960 --> 01:35:20.960]   But even that would be...
[01:35:20.960 --> 01:35:22.960]   That's just in VR.
[01:35:22.960 --> 01:35:27.040]   Seeing it with your friends where you can actually hear a voice to your left and then
[01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:32.800]   you turn around and you see an avatar and of course, yeah, put the rumble pack like
[01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:33.800]   behind it.
[01:35:33.800 --> 01:35:35.800]   Sit with your back on the rumble pack so you can see.
[01:35:35.800 --> 01:35:36.800]   I'm going to lock you.
[01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:38.800]   If he doesn't settle down by the...
[01:35:38.800 --> 01:35:39.800]   One more times?
[01:35:39.800 --> 01:35:40.800]   Physical scene.
[01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:41.800]   I don't have words.
[01:35:41.800 --> 01:35:42.800]   I'm just going to have words.
[01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:43.800]   I just got have words.
[01:35:43.800 --> 01:35:45.440]   Words are going to have to be had.
[01:35:45.440 --> 01:35:49.120]   So speaking of words, I think Leo has one last announcement for us.
[01:35:49.120 --> 01:35:50.680]   I think he's got one more in the can.
[01:35:50.680 --> 01:35:51.680]   All right.
[01:35:51.680 --> 01:35:53.040]   More Mac break weekly coming up in just a bit.
[01:35:53.040 --> 01:35:57.480]   But first, I want to tell you how well I slept last night on my Casper.
[01:35:57.480 --> 01:35:58.480]   [sighs]
[01:35:58.480 --> 01:36:01.120]   Heaven, I'm in heaven.
[01:36:01.120 --> 01:36:07.960]   Casper mattresses proudly made in the USA engineered obsessively to give you what I
[01:36:07.960 --> 01:36:10.680]   think everybody's looking for, which is...
[01:36:10.680 --> 01:36:13.280]   That's kind of hard to describe, but it's springy.
[01:36:13.280 --> 01:36:14.800]   It's soft, but it's firm.
[01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:16.080]   How do I describe that?
[01:36:16.080 --> 01:36:17.880]   It's exactly what you want.
[01:36:17.880 --> 01:36:20.880]   It's firm, but forgiving.
[01:36:20.880 --> 01:36:24.600]   It's springy latex foam, supportive memory foam combined to give you just the right
[01:36:24.600 --> 01:36:29.080]   sink, just the right bounce, and just the right long term comfort and support.
[01:36:29.080 --> 01:36:33.320]   And by the way, as the summertime comes and it's going to be hot, you'll love it because
[01:36:33.320 --> 01:36:34.760]   it breathes.
[01:36:34.760 --> 01:36:37.200]   So this is a cool mattress.
[01:36:37.200 --> 01:36:40.680]   And studies show that it's important to your sleep quality.
[01:36:40.680 --> 01:36:43.400]   Casper offers free delivery.
[01:36:43.400 --> 01:36:45.560]   And here's the best part.
[01:36:45.560 --> 01:36:46.560]   And they had to do this, right?
[01:36:46.560 --> 01:36:50.320]   When you sell mattresses on the internet, direct from the factory, the first thing people
[01:36:50.320 --> 01:36:52.600]   are going to say, "You probably always say this, "Well, I can't buy a mattress."
[01:36:52.600 --> 01:36:54.400]   That's sleeping on it first.
[01:36:54.400 --> 01:36:55.400]   You don't have...
[01:36:55.400 --> 01:36:56.400]   Here's the deal.
[01:36:56.400 --> 01:36:58.120]   Order your Casper mattress.
[01:36:58.120 --> 01:37:02.160]   Very affordable because there's no middle man markup, right?
[01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:05.440]   It starts at $500 for a twin.
[01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:10.160]   You order your mattress, lie on it for 100 nights.
[01:37:10.160 --> 01:37:14.240]   If at any time in the first 100 nights, 100 nights, more than three months, if at any
[01:37:14.240 --> 01:37:16.520]   time you go, "Yeah, it's not for me."
[01:37:16.520 --> 01:37:17.520]   You call them.
[01:37:17.520 --> 01:37:18.520]   They will come.
[01:37:18.520 --> 01:37:19.520]   They will get it.
[01:37:19.520 --> 01:37:20.520]   They will dispose of it.
[01:37:20.520 --> 01:37:21.520]   And they will refund you every penny.
[01:37:21.520 --> 01:37:23.520]   It costs you nothing.
[01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:25.720]   So it really is safe.
[01:37:25.720 --> 01:37:26.920]   And they know you want to try it.
[01:37:26.920 --> 01:37:27.920]   What's better?
[01:37:27.920 --> 01:37:33.360]   I mean, five minutes with a sales girl looking at you going, "What are you doing there?"
[01:37:33.360 --> 01:37:36.960]   In a store with it's probably lit in the fluorescent lights and the people in...
[01:37:36.960 --> 01:37:42.880]   Or 100 nights in the comfort and safety and security of your own home.
[01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:43.880]   And you know why they do this?
[01:37:43.880 --> 01:37:47.400]   It doesn't work because nobody ever wants to give back a Casper.
[01:37:47.400 --> 01:37:49.720]   They go, "This is the best mattress I've met."
[01:37:49.720 --> 01:37:51.400]   Mostly what I hear is what we did.
[01:37:51.400 --> 01:37:52.680]   People buy more.
[01:37:52.680 --> 01:37:54.880]   I bought one for my son in the dorms.
[01:37:54.880 --> 01:37:58.400]   I actually think I'm going to buy another one and form this fall.
[01:37:58.400 --> 01:37:59.400]   Casper.
[01:37:59.400 --> 01:38:02.640]   I want you to go to Casper.com/Macbreak.

[01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:15.320]   It's Casper, C-A-S-P-E-R.com/MacBreak.
[01:38:15.320 --> 01:38:17.120]   It's the Goldilocks of mattresses.
[01:38:17.120 --> 01:38:19.360]   Not too hard, not too soft.
[01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:22.920]   Just write Casper.com/MacBreak.
[01:38:22.920 --> 01:38:27.160]   We thank them so much for their support of MacBreak Weekly.
[01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:29.880]   Leo, of course, on special assignment.
[01:38:29.880 --> 01:38:34.360]   I'm here with Andy Inako from the Chicago Sun Times and Alex Lindsey from Pixel Core.
[01:38:34.360 --> 01:38:38.480]   And they have merged their streams to combine and to like Voltron something mightier.
[01:38:38.480 --> 01:38:44.480]   Actually, I'm hoping that we can end the show by Alex.
[01:38:44.480 --> 01:38:53.640]   I'm Alex Lindsey from Pixel Core.
[01:38:53.640 --> 01:38:57.480]   And I'm Andy Inako of the Chicago Sun Times and the balcony is closed.
[01:38:57.480 --> 01:39:00.480]   We need to loop that in and put it at the end.
[01:39:00.480 --> 01:39:01.480]   That is awesome.
[01:39:01.480 --> 01:39:04.280]   All right, so it is picks of the week time.
[01:39:04.280 --> 01:39:07.800]   Andy, I know you quasi-spoiled your pick of the week already, but is it still okay to
[01:39:07.800 --> 01:39:08.800]   go?
[01:39:08.800 --> 01:39:12.040]   I'll use that next week because I'm traveling and actually have...
[01:39:12.040 --> 01:39:16.320]   I like these sort of bizarre, not bizarre, but maybe a little off the wall.
[01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:17.880]   I'm suggesting that you go...
[01:39:17.880 --> 01:39:23.480]   You should go on eBay and just do a search for like little plastic boxes because there's
[01:39:23.480 --> 01:39:25.280]   as opposed to little fluffy clouds.
[01:39:25.280 --> 01:39:26.280]   That's what I search for.
[01:39:26.280 --> 01:39:28.520]   Little plastic boxes.
[01:39:28.520 --> 01:39:35.960]   They're wonderful because I wasn't aware of the obvious that there are like both manufacturers
[01:39:35.960 --> 01:39:42.200]   in China that will just sell you a jillion of something kind of useful for next to nothing.
[01:39:42.200 --> 01:39:43.200]   And because for no...
[01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:45.200]   Like a 1.3, sorry.
[01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:48.480]   No, you said valuable for next to nothing.
[01:39:48.480 --> 01:39:49.480]   It applies.
[01:39:49.480 --> 01:39:51.040]   It's not that it was so mean spirited.
[01:39:51.040 --> 01:39:53.720]   It's kind of the fact that it was so fast.
[01:39:53.720 --> 01:39:59.000]   It's as if you didn't even occur to you to not say it.
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:00.000]   That's disturbing.
[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.440]   You've had control of the show for what?
[01:40:02.440 --> 01:40:04.960]   Only two hours and already right to his head.
[01:40:04.960 --> 01:40:05.960]   Oh, yeah.
[01:40:05.960 --> 01:40:06.960]   Sorry, I apologize.
[01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:07.960]   I'm contrite.
[01:40:07.960 --> 01:40:08.960]   Canadian apologies.
[01:40:08.960 --> 01:40:09.960]   Canadian apologies.
[01:40:09.960 --> 01:40:16.400]   I mean, it's got cheese curds and malt sugar on it.
[01:40:16.400 --> 01:40:21.880]   Yeah, so I just bought like a big bag of like little plastic boxes thinking because I'm
[01:40:21.880 --> 01:40:25.720]   doing a part of the house cleaning I've been doing is like just trying to find getting
[01:40:25.720 --> 01:40:27.840]   sorted and make sure that people are things.
[01:40:27.840 --> 01:40:33.880]   And so like the huge just like bubble wrap bag that has like maybe like 40 of these and
[01:40:33.880 --> 01:40:37.040]   it costs me, I don't know, like seven or eight dollars.
[01:40:37.040 --> 01:40:42.000]   And so now when I now when I travel and even when I'm just going to the coffee shop, I
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:46.360]   have like a little box that has like little like never leaves my bag that always has a
[01:40:46.360 --> 01:40:53.720]   lens cleaning cloth, two AA batteries, a set of earplugs, a little bit of gaffer tape and
[01:40:53.720 --> 01:40:55.520]   some lens cleaning stuff.
[01:40:55.520 --> 01:40:57.440]   So I'm never without gaffer tape.
[01:40:57.440 --> 01:40:59.720]   Sorry, never without gaffer tape.
[01:40:59.720 --> 01:41:03.040]   You're using a tape kit, which is what I use to put to extinguish the light on the
[01:41:03.040 --> 01:41:04.040]   front of my Apple TV.
[01:41:04.040 --> 01:41:05.040]   Because Apple was right before me.
[01:41:05.040 --> 01:41:06.040]   Right.
[01:41:06.040 --> 01:41:09.120]   It's like so now I know that I never leave the house with it.
[01:41:09.120 --> 01:41:15.720]   This is this is the the the dongle rodeo because because I'm traveling with just the just the
[01:41:15.720 --> 01:41:19.440]   iPad pro and I have to like post photos and stuff like this.
[01:41:19.440 --> 01:41:24.360]   So just so now I have again, it didn't occur to me that I need to prepare a special kit.
[01:41:24.360 --> 01:41:25.440]   I'll order a special box.
[01:41:25.440 --> 01:41:29.680]   It was no, I've got a huge bag full of these little plastic boxes.
[01:41:29.680 --> 01:41:33.320]   And so when I needed to solve that problem yesterday morning when I was packing, I just
[01:41:33.320 --> 01:41:40.600]   somebody said, okay, there is my USB, there is my card reader for my my Android phone.
[01:41:40.600 --> 01:41:44.600]   And here is the SD card reader for for the iPad.
[01:41:44.600 --> 01:41:48.280]   And now instead of rummaging, it'd be fine if it was just in one of the pouches of my
[01:41:48.280 --> 01:41:49.280]   bag.
[01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:52.480]   And I know if I keep pulling things out, I will eventually find this.
[01:41:52.480 --> 01:41:56.440]   But now I've got all these these three things together in a little plastic box.
[01:41:56.440 --> 01:41:57.440]   I do.
[01:41:57.440 --> 01:41:59.560]   It's not like, you know, mil spec.
[01:41:59.560 --> 01:42:03.080]   It does hold together as a little bit of extra.
[01:42:03.080 --> 01:42:06.720]   I'll say there are two reasons why I have I had this little extra piece of gaffer tape
[01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:07.720]   on it.
[01:42:07.720 --> 01:42:11.040]   Number one, as a little bit of extra, you know, insurance to make sure it doesn't pop open
[01:42:11.040 --> 01:42:12.320]   and spills contents.
[01:42:12.320 --> 01:42:16.880]   But also that's a way for me to sneak an extra six inches of gaffer tape into my bag that
[01:42:16.880 --> 01:42:20.440]   I could then peel off and use for something to fix something.
[01:42:20.440 --> 01:42:23.720]   And it's I like it because it costs you next thing and next to nothing, you'll have like
[01:42:23.720 --> 01:42:25.040]   20 or 30 of these.
[01:42:25.040 --> 01:42:29.640]   And that means that instead of packing for a trip or putting something together because
[01:42:29.640 --> 01:42:33.200]   you're going to loan like a battery pack or something to a friend of yours and you want
[01:42:33.200 --> 01:42:36.840]   to make sure that they don't they don't lose lose all the stuff or make sure that you make
[01:42:36.840 --> 01:42:41.440]   sure you don't forget to give them the one adapter they need in addition to all the cables.
[01:42:41.440 --> 01:42:45.400]   Instead of thinking, Oh gosh, I should wouldn't be nice if I'd ordered like two days went
[01:42:45.400 --> 01:42:49.040]   to a store and found a little bag like no, you will have a bag of these things was a
[01:42:49.040 --> 01:42:50.040]   big grab one.
[01:42:50.040 --> 01:42:52.640]   You don't care if you ever get back again, but now you've got everything together in
[01:42:52.640 --> 01:42:53.640]   one.
[01:42:53.640 --> 01:42:58.960]   It's it's it's it's it's nice if you're stubborn like me and you're very you're very very
[01:42:58.960 --> 01:43:04.040]   it makes it's very very easy for you to not remember if you have actually brought the
[01:43:04.040 --> 01:43:08.760]   right cables or not because now if you basically create a field kit that this is there is one
[01:43:08.760 --> 01:43:13.960]   of these and every single one of my bags, an exact duplicate of each one of these.
[01:43:13.960 --> 01:43:19.040]   So even I've got I've also got the real cables that the USB cables that are the nice ones.
[01:43:19.040 --> 01:43:22.480]   But if I forget to pack that I'm not screwed because I also have a mini one that's in this
[01:43:22.480 --> 01:43:23.480]   one.
[01:43:23.480 --> 01:43:28.480]   And just go and I'm not recommending any one manufacturer going to eBay, look for little
[01:43:28.480 --> 01:43:31.880]   containers or little bags or little zipper bags.
[01:43:31.880 --> 01:43:37.960]   And I guarantee you what to add at the gift shop near the near the near the tourist attraction
[01:43:37.960 --> 01:43:41.360]   near your house where they charge $4.80 for this.
[01:43:41.360 --> 01:43:47.480]   It's $4.80 and if you want a hundred of them, they're just going to like put a shovel full
[01:43:47.480 --> 01:43:51.000]   into a poly bag and you'll get it in six weeks.
[01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:55.040]   It doesn't matter to them whether they're showing you saying you for 400.
[01:43:55.040 --> 01:43:57.120]   That's a little bit of a hole in that.
[01:43:57.120 --> 01:43:58.120]   Awesome.
[01:43:58.120 --> 01:43:59.440]   And what about you Alex?
[01:43:59.440 --> 01:44:05.920]   So mine is I'm going to actually recommend the WWDC app and that came out last week.
[01:44:05.920 --> 01:44:08.120]   I don't know if you guys talked about it at all.
[01:44:08.120 --> 01:44:11.560]   But one of the things I the reason that I wanted to talk about it a little bit was because
[01:44:11.560 --> 01:44:15.320]   I think Apple just did a great job making all that content available, making it available
[01:44:15.320 --> 01:44:17.200]   live, making it available schedule.
[01:44:17.200 --> 01:44:18.200]   So quickly.
[01:44:18.200 --> 01:44:25.240]   I mean, it is, you know, and I think that the, I think that it's a really, what WWDC does
[01:44:25.240 --> 01:44:30.200]   really well is they make all the content available.
[01:44:30.200 --> 01:44:34.220]   I mean, basically can see everything that was that happened there without losing the
[01:44:34.220 --> 01:44:38.560]   value of going to WWDC because of the, you know, the one ones with engineers and so
[01:44:38.560 --> 01:44:40.440]   on and so forth that you're there.
[01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:42.880]   There's no one would ever say, well, you made all the videos available.
[01:44:42.880 --> 01:44:43.880]   So now I'm not going to go.
[01:44:43.880 --> 01:44:45.480]   You know, you know, no, I'm not interested in going.
[01:44:45.480 --> 01:44:49.240]   Number one is just, there's not that many seats, but number two is, you know, I think
[01:44:49.240 --> 01:44:53.520]   that it shows you, I, what I think is the future of conferences, which is that we are,
[01:44:53.520 --> 01:44:57.400]   you know, going to extend the impact of that, you know, whether people are paying for it
[01:44:57.400 --> 01:44:58.400]   or not paying for it.
[01:44:58.400 --> 01:45:02.000]   In this case, Apple doesn't need them to pay for it.
[01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.160]   But I think that, you know, we're going to make a great app to make it, make sure that
[01:45:04.160 --> 01:45:05.320]   everybody can watch it.
[01:45:05.320 --> 01:45:06.320]   They can watch it in real time.
[01:45:06.320 --> 01:45:07.320]   They can watch it later.
[01:45:07.320 --> 01:45:08.320]   They can do all those other things.
[01:45:08.320 --> 01:45:11.480]   And I think that, you know, I think Apple's ahead of that.
[01:45:11.480 --> 01:45:15.680]   I think we see a lot of people doing small samples of their conference or little bits
[01:45:15.680 --> 01:45:21.520]   and pieces, but not only streaming all of it, but making it readily available and easy
[01:45:21.520 --> 01:45:23.440]   to find and easy to work with.
[01:45:23.440 --> 01:45:27.040]   I think that we're going to see a lot more of that as people see what the power is of
[01:45:27.040 --> 01:45:28.040]   it.
[01:45:28.040 --> 01:45:29.280]   And I think that, you know, Apple did a great job at it.
[01:45:29.280 --> 01:45:30.280]   Yeah.
[01:45:30.280 --> 01:45:32.920]   People aren't aware that you can go into the ground floor has labs.
[01:45:32.920 --> 01:45:38.040]   And half the reason for going to WWDC was, of course, I need to see the keynote.
[01:45:38.040 --> 01:45:39.280]   I need to see some of the sessions.
[01:45:39.280 --> 01:45:43.600]   Like now it's like, it's not the only reason to go, but I was like, I can see the keynote
[01:45:43.600 --> 01:45:45.320]   from home and I can download it.
[01:45:45.320 --> 01:45:47.600]   And I can also see all the sessions.
[01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:53.320]   And I'll have $1,200 to spend on a new MacBook that will be more capable of writing my Xcode.
[01:45:53.320 --> 01:45:58.920]   Well, and I was, I, there's definitely ones I saw going by.
[01:45:58.920 --> 01:46:01.800]   And I was like, oh, I'm going to have to stop everything to watch this.
[01:46:01.800 --> 01:46:02.800]   And I was like, wait a minute.
[01:46:02.800 --> 01:46:04.520]   I'm going to be able to watch this next week.
[01:46:04.520 --> 01:46:05.520]   I'm just going to be able to watch the movie.
[01:46:05.520 --> 01:46:06.520]   I can watch it on a plane.
[01:46:06.520 --> 01:46:09.240]   You know, I don't have to, you know, and now you go up to the app now and you can hit
[01:46:09.240 --> 01:46:11.200]   it down low, down low, down low.
[01:46:11.200 --> 01:46:15.720]   And I would definitely suggest one downloading the Swift Playground once because it was great.
[01:46:15.720 --> 01:46:17.600]   And the downstairs at Moscone.
[01:46:17.600 --> 01:46:18.600]   Oh, sorry.
[01:46:18.600 --> 01:46:19.600]   Oh, no, the downstairs.
[01:46:19.600 --> 01:46:21.600]   I said, oh, sorry.
[01:46:21.600 --> 01:46:22.600]   Sorry about that.
[01:46:22.600 --> 01:46:26.060]   I'm a, I'm a, for people who are wondering what I was up to, of course, like it's 90
[01:46:26.060 --> 01:46:29.640]   degrees outside and I walked like all the way here from, from the event and now air
[01:46:29.640 --> 01:46:33.440]   condition in here, which means that all the sweat that was on my face dried, but leaving
[01:46:33.440 --> 01:46:34.760]   like a layer of like salt.
[01:46:34.760 --> 01:46:38.880]   And I think I actually took some salt and put it into my eye.
[01:46:38.880 --> 01:46:39.880]   Okay.
[01:46:39.880 --> 01:46:44.720]   So I have to, I had to deal with this rather, rather than you think that, you think that
[01:46:44.720 --> 01:46:47.640]   I can't see what you wrote there on your screen about my body odor.
[01:46:47.640 --> 01:46:48.640]   Well, you know what I'm working on it.
[01:46:48.640 --> 01:46:49.640]   It's hot up there.
[01:46:49.640 --> 01:46:53.520]   The thing I was going to say is that, uh, if you're not familiar with WDC, if you haven't
[01:46:53.520 --> 01:46:58.480]   been there, the entire first floor of Moscone West is, is called labs and you go in there
[01:46:58.480 --> 01:47:03.200]   and there's on the left hand side, there's just open area after open area where they have
[01:47:03.200 --> 01:47:04.720]   frameworks labs and web labs.
[01:47:04.720 --> 01:47:08.760]   And in the middle, they have developer tools labs going all the way towards the
[01:47:08.760 --> 01:47:11.800]   back and on the right, they have a bunch of different areas where people can sit and
[01:47:11.800 --> 01:47:14.040]   download, but you're often waiting for labs.
[01:47:14.040 --> 01:47:17.880]   And what they do that's that I love so much is that they actually broadcast the sessions
[01:47:17.880 --> 01:47:20.240]   on big screens throughout the labs area.
[01:47:20.240 --> 01:47:23.560]   So if you're waiting or if you're sitting, if you're loading software, because they have
[01:47:23.560 --> 01:47:27.680]   ethernet so you can download the betas faster, you can watch the sessions.
[01:47:27.680 --> 01:47:31.560]   And for the last two years, originally the WDC videos were, if you didn't see the session
[01:47:31.560 --> 01:47:36.480]   and you just saw the video, it was only the slide, which I find much harder to watch than
[01:47:36.480 --> 01:47:38.840]   an actual dynamic human presenter.
[01:47:38.840 --> 01:47:42.600]   But for the last couple of years, you actually see the presenter and they cut between them
[01:47:42.600 --> 01:47:48.080]   and they walk and it's shot as well as the keynote is shot and as dynamically as a keynote
[01:47:48.080 --> 01:47:49.080]   is shot.
[01:47:49.080 --> 01:47:52.720]   And that makes them so much more human and relatable to me.
[01:47:52.720 --> 01:47:56.520]   And I just, I find watching them so much easier and you get all of that, like Alex said, right
[01:47:56.520 --> 01:47:57.520]   in the app.
[01:47:57.520 --> 01:48:01.160]   So, and it was Apple TV, it's on Apple Watch, the complications were telling you what time
[01:48:01.160 --> 01:48:02.560]   to go to the sessions.
[01:48:02.560 --> 01:48:05.200]   And on iPhone and iPad, you can just download and stream and watch them.
[01:48:05.200 --> 01:48:06.520]   It was really well put together.
[01:48:06.520 --> 01:48:10.800]   I think you came back to what we were saying earlier about like how 10 million dollar episode
[01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:13.640]   of Game of Thrones is competing with the hydraulic press channel.
[01:48:13.640 --> 01:48:20.200]   It's like if I, if I time traveled back and told like 11 year old Andy that someday you're
[01:48:20.200 --> 01:48:28.480]   going to have a 55 inch television set, whose resolution is as good as any movie theater,
[01:48:28.480 --> 01:48:32.280]   like, Oh my God, what, what, what do we watch on it?
[01:48:32.280 --> 01:48:34.520]   Mostly demo videos of people writing code.
[01:48:34.520 --> 01:48:38.880]   And Ben Heck soldering things.
[01:48:38.880 --> 01:48:39.880]   We watched that.
[01:48:39.880 --> 01:48:40.880]   Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[01:48:40.880 --> 01:48:44.320]   But why do we watch Star Wars?
[01:48:44.320 --> 01:48:47.040]   Because George Lucas kind of ruined it for press.
[01:48:47.040 --> 01:48:49.640]   No, don't make the landy cry.
[01:48:49.640 --> 01:48:52.320]   We still, there's still Indiana Jones.
[01:48:52.320 --> 01:48:53.720]   Indiana Jones is still perfect.
[01:48:53.720 --> 01:48:55.560]   Don't watch the fourth one.
[01:48:55.560 --> 01:48:56.560]   Right.
[01:48:56.560 --> 01:48:57.560]   Third one.
[01:48:57.560 --> 01:48:58.960]   Don't have good good expectations for you.
[01:48:58.960 --> 01:49:00.400]   The second one is nice and scary.
[01:49:00.400 --> 01:49:02.280]   And the first one was always perfect.
[01:49:02.280 --> 01:49:04.360]   The first one was excited.
[01:49:04.360 --> 01:49:07.400]   My pick of the week is something that sort of goes hand in hand with the playground app.
[01:49:07.400 --> 01:49:10.080]   Now Apple's been doing Apple camps for a few years.
[01:49:10.080 --> 01:49:11.480]   It's Apple retail that does them.
[01:49:11.480 --> 01:49:15.400]   It's available right now in almost every Apple store in the Northern Hemisphere.
[01:49:15.400 --> 01:49:16.400]   They're a summer camp.
[01:49:16.400 --> 01:49:18.600]   So Southern Hemisphere doesn't have summer right now.
[01:49:18.600 --> 01:49:19.600]   They'll get them later.
[01:49:19.600 --> 01:49:23.240]   But if you are in the Northern Hemisphere and you have an Apple store near you, you can
[01:49:23.240 --> 01:49:28.120]   sign up and there's you can do traditionally you can do iMovie and you can do iBooks and
[01:49:28.120 --> 01:49:33.680]   they will spend a week, a three day week basically showing kids from the ages of eight to 12
[01:49:33.680 --> 01:49:36.640]   how to get into movies, how to get into iBooks.
[01:49:36.640 --> 01:49:37.640]   This year they're upgrading.
[01:49:37.640 --> 01:49:41.040]   So you'll be able to use an iPad Pro and for the iBooks session you'll be able to use
[01:49:41.040 --> 01:49:42.520]   an Apple Pencil.
[01:49:42.520 --> 01:49:48.480]   But if you are in the US, Canada, the UK or China, they're adding a third week to it.
[01:49:48.480 --> 01:49:53.640]   And that's a coding week and you'll learn to code games and do and program robots.
[01:49:53.640 --> 01:49:58.720]   So they're using I think it's called Tint for the, I might be pronouncing that wrong,
[01:49:58.720 --> 01:50:02.520]   for the coding part of it because Swift Playgrounds is still in beta and is actually meant for
[01:50:02.520 --> 01:50:04.920]   a little bit older age group from 12 and up.
[01:50:04.920 --> 01:50:08.480]   But this is almost like an introduction to it and they're using Sphero for the robot
[01:50:08.480 --> 01:50:13.320]   programming and you'll get a couple days to be able to learn how to do basic code, to
[01:50:13.320 --> 01:50:15.920]   be able to learn how to do basic commands for the robot.
[01:50:15.920 --> 01:50:18.080]   And they're also taking better care of parents this year.
[01:50:18.080 --> 01:50:21.400]   So if you're there with your child, they'll explain the apps to you.
[01:50:21.400 --> 01:50:23.320]   They'll show you how to do things like family sharing.
[01:50:23.320 --> 01:50:25.160]   They'll teach you how to code too.
[01:50:25.160 --> 01:50:29.640]   I mean, if you want to stay there the whole time, they will absolutely make you feel welcome.
[01:50:29.640 --> 01:50:33.000]   And every store is doing this is absolutely free sign up started today.
[01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:37.080]   So sometimes in some stores, depending on where they are, the sign up goes faster or
[01:50:37.080 --> 01:50:41.800]   slower, but absolutely head on over there and you can go to your Apple retail store page
[01:50:41.800 --> 01:50:44.400]   and you'll see the summer camp or the Apple camp sign up.
[01:50:44.400 --> 01:50:46.760]   I took my God's children last year to the IM movie one.
[01:50:46.760 --> 01:50:47.960]   They had a phenomenal time.
[01:50:47.960 --> 01:50:50.920]   I'm going to take them this year to the code one.
[01:50:50.920 --> 01:50:53.240]   They're hotly anticipating it already.
[01:50:53.240 --> 01:50:57.200]   And I think this again just shows that you would, yes, the kids do get to see a bunch
[01:50:57.200 --> 01:51:01.640]   of Apple products and Apple stores and that is good for Apple as a brand.
[01:51:01.640 --> 01:51:05.440]   But they're devoting a tremendous amount of resources and personnel and time and attention
[01:51:05.440 --> 01:51:06.840]   to education.
[01:51:06.840 --> 01:51:10.160]   And I really am optimistic about those kinds of things.
[01:51:10.160 --> 01:51:12.240]   So Apple camp, make sure you check it out.
[01:51:12.240 --> 01:51:17.440]   I'm glad that Apple's continuing to extend and expand the mission of the Apple store to
[01:51:17.440 --> 01:51:21.960]   turn it into a real, not just a service bay and not just a place to trick people into
[01:51:21.960 --> 01:51:25.440]   buying a new cover they don't need, but also here's a place that we will give you free
[01:51:25.440 --> 01:51:28.920]   education and help you be even happier with the product that you were already pretty
[01:51:28.920 --> 01:51:29.920]   happy with.
[01:51:29.920 --> 01:51:33.160]   I'm glad I'm glad to see them doing more of it.
[01:51:33.160 --> 01:51:36.800]   I do feel like they lost something when they started designing away from the theaters because
[01:51:36.800 --> 01:51:39.440]   I actually spoke at a lot of those theaters and I really felt like it was a lot of fun.
[01:51:39.440 --> 01:51:41.640]   It's back at Union Square, Alex.
[01:51:41.640 --> 01:51:43.160]   You know, I haven't.
[01:51:43.160 --> 01:51:46.080]   I was six K. I was around all last week and I didn't get to.
[01:51:46.080 --> 01:51:47.080]   I didn't go.
[01:51:47.080 --> 01:51:48.080]   I didn't go to there.
[01:51:48.080 --> 01:51:49.080]   I got to go to there.
[01:51:49.080 --> 01:51:55.400]   I will say with pride that I was the first speaker at an Apple store theater anywhere
[01:51:55.400 --> 01:51:56.400]   in Europe.
[01:51:56.400 --> 01:51:57.500]   Because I was there.
[01:51:57.500 --> 01:52:02.680]   The opening of the London Apple store, the very first store, I was the very first speaker
[01:52:02.680 --> 01:52:03.680]   in that place.
[01:52:03.680 --> 01:52:10.200]   So I put a stink in there that no other presenter has ever managed to raise that.
[01:52:10.200 --> 01:52:11.920]   That funk does not clear from that room.
[01:52:11.920 --> 01:52:15.040]   What Andy Naco has spoken there.
[01:52:15.040 --> 01:52:16.200]   It's salty, salty funk.
[01:52:16.200 --> 01:52:18.000]   No, they should be coming back.
[01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:22.920]   So a forum which has those big screens and all that's geometric seating should be a staple
[01:52:22.920 --> 01:52:25.040]   of some of the flagship stores going forward.
[01:52:25.040 --> 01:52:26.040]   So it's back, Alex.
[01:52:26.040 --> 01:52:31.200]   Yeah, we did a couple of Mac breaks from the Apple store and I, you know, and it was, we
[01:52:31.200 --> 01:52:32.200]   should do that again.
[01:52:32.200 --> 01:52:33.200]   Yeah.
[01:52:33.200 --> 01:52:34.440]   We're talking about the Playhouse gang.
[01:52:34.440 --> 01:52:35.440]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:52:35.440 --> 01:52:38.400]   Leo will talk to Angela and we'll just get it all worked out.
[01:52:38.400 --> 01:52:40.240]   All right.
[01:52:40.240 --> 01:52:43.840]   So that regretfully brings us to the end of this two hours of fun.
[01:52:43.840 --> 01:52:47.320]   Alex Lindsey, if people are searching for you on the internet, where can they go?
[01:52:47.320 --> 01:52:48.600]   What are your latest projects?
[01:52:48.600 --> 01:52:49.600]   Give up.
[01:52:49.600 --> 01:52:50.600]   Just give up.
[01:52:50.600 --> 01:52:51.600]   You're never going to find me.
[01:52:51.600 --> 01:52:52.600]   You never got to find me.
[01:52:52.600 --> 01:52:53.600]   I found you right there.
[01:52:53.600 --> 01:52:54.600]   Yeah.
[01:52:54.600 --> 01:52:58.640]   So Alex Lindsey on Twitter is probably the best place to see.
[01:52:58.640 --> 01:53:01.080]   And that's probably the best place to find me.
[01:53:01.080 --> 01:53:05.720]   I, you know, of course you can get a pick score and talk about training and stuff like
[01:53:05.720 --> 01:53:06.720]   that.
[01:53:06.720 --> 01:53:10.000]   But Alex Lindsey and I'll usually post if I'm showing up somewhere where I have time
[01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.920]   to have a meeting or I do do random get-togethers.
[01:53:12.920 --> 01:53:17.080]   Usually I won't give you any warning, but I'll be suddenly like, I'm in Tokyo.
[01:53:17.080 --> 01:53:18.840]   Who wants to meet this afternoon?
[01:53:18.840 --> 01:53:21.840]   You know, so so if you follow me, that's probably the best.
[01:53:21.840 --> 01:53:22.840]   That's probably the best.
[01:53:22.840 --> 01:53:23.840]   That's funny.
[01:53:23.840 --> 01:53:28.320]   And the last two times, the last two times I was in San Francisco, I ran into Shifty
[01:53:28.320 --> 01:53:32.040]   Russell who every time I ran into Numseti either had to go and record or edit the material
[01:53:32.040 --> 01:53:34.160]   podcast with you, Andy.
[01:53:34.160 --> 01:53:35.160]   Yep.
[01:53:35.160 --> 01:53:39.240]   We're doing as we're fact, we're doing another episode tonight.
[01:53:39.240 --> 01:53:40.240]   It's funny.
[01:53:40.240 --> 01:53:41.960]   This is a complete barnstorming trip to DC.
[01:53:41.960 --> 01:53:43.640]   I got off the train.
[01:53:43.640 --> 01:53:48.920]   I went directly to Washington Post building for this, for the summit.
[01:53:48.920 --> 01:53:53.520]   Came right from there to here, then I'm coming from right there to a Maker Fair that's happening
[01:53:53.520 --> 01:53:55.160]   on Capitol Hill somewhere.
[01:53:55.160 --> 01:53:58.120]   And then after that, going directly to recording material.
[01:53:58.120 --> 01:54:01.400]   And then one hour after that, I bought a train home.
[01:54:01.400 --> 01:54:02.400]   It's a productive day.
[01:54:02.400 --> 01:54:04.320]   It's a productive day.
[01:54:04.320 --> 01:54:09.840]   When you get $210 round trip out of Andy Anatko for a day in DC, damn it, he's going to make
[01:54:09.840 --> 01:54:11.800]   every ounce of value out there.
[01:54:11.800 --> 01:54:12.800]   Exactly.
[01:54:12.800 --> 01:54:14.040]   And people are looking for you elsewhere.
[01:54:14.040 --> 01:54:15.800]   Where can they go?
[01:54:15.800 --> 01:54:16.960]   Spell my last name.
[01:54:16.960 --> 01:54:20.600]   It's the rumple, still skin little spell you need to actually find me.
[01:54:20.600 --> 01:54:22.920]   I'm an not go on Twitter and go to not go.com.
[01:54:22.920 --> 01:54:27.120]   And you can see I try to remember to post links to places where things get published
[01:54:27.120 --> 01:54:32.320]   on the Sun Time site and podcasts that they do and other sundry synaptic misfirings.
[01:54:32.320 --> 01:54:33.320]   Awesome.
[01:54:33.320 --> 01:54:37.920]   Leo couldn't be with us this week, but he will be with us again one day, hopefully one
[01:54:37.920 --> 01:54:39.360]   day soon.
[01:54:39.360 --> 01:54:43.720]   You can watch the show live at 11 o'clock Pacific on Tuesdays.
[01:54:43.720 --> 01:54:45.920]   That is 2 p.m., 2 p.m. Eastern.
[01:54:45.920 --> 01:54:47.560]   I believe so 2 p.m. Eastern.
[01:54:47.560 --> 01:54:53.280]   If you miss the show, though, it's available on demand on YouTube at Twit.tv in iTunes.
[01:54:53.280 --> 01:54:57.280]   Every single podcasting platform in the known universe.
[01:54:57.280 --> 01:55:00.640]   Thank you both for helping me survive this show, especially when both of you were on
[01:55:00.640 --> 01:55:07.120]   location when I had to switch like in the movie theater side to side to watch you both.
[01:55:07.120 --> 01:55:09.040]   We'll be back next week.
[01:55:09.040 --> 01:55:13.760]   We were back next week and for now, get back to work because Mac break is over.
[01:55:13.760 --> 01:55:14.760]   Yeah.
[01:55:14.760 --> 01:55:17.760]   Skype sucks.
[01:55:17.760 --> 01:55:30.760]   But you had the best engineer in the world working on the problem.
[01:55:30.760 --> 01:55:36.400]   Anyway, the only time I have to deal with Skype is this show, not that I'm bitter.
[01:55:36.400 --> 01:55:38.760]   I just like, you know, how much I love you guys.
[01:55:38.760 --> 01:55:40.520]   Well, can I get a deal with it?
[01:55:40.520 --> 01:55:45.080]   This is why it's such a good timing that I'm here in the studio because if I were back
[01:55:45.080 --> 01:55:48.880]   in Boston, I couldn't do this right now.
[01:55:48.880 --> 01:55:51.880]   Oh, hey.
[01:55:51.880 --> 01:55:54.880]   [SINGING]
[01:55:54.880 --> 01:55:55.880]   That was beautiful.
[01:55:55.880 --> 01:56:02.360]   Now I'm totally jealous.
[01:56:02.360 --> 01:56:05.880]   You're not responsible for Skype's emotional problems.
[01:56:05.880 --> 01:56:13.840]   And Skype is wrong to make you pay the balance on a check that it wrote itself for Bad Car.
[01:56:13.840 --> 01:56:14.840]   Bad check.
[01:56:14.840 --> 01:56:15.840]   And you're not going to go.
[01:56:15.840 --> 01:56:16.840]   It's not you.
