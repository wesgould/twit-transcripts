[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.960]   Andy Naco from the Chicago Sun Times you're gonna have to take some time off Andy because I really I really should I mean
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.320]   There's a lot of great stuff there at the Sun Times. I've got all bases covered
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:38.000]   I you know I could lay down my sword and shield for just three days to maybe get some fried clams take a dip in the ocean
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.880]   But I just feel too great a responsibility Leo and to you the listeners and to my readers to provide them with the well
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.880]   No, not really but
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.540]   They don't they don't pay them a freelancer. They don't pay me unless I
[00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.840]   Freelancers don't get a vacation. I forgot about that
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.040]   Yeah, it's it's that's you get paid when you work period
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:04.920]   Yes, but I see that that that it also allows us to like create these wrong wrong wrong impressions with our friends and family that he is so
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.640]   Devoted to his craft. He was working on Christmas. He was working on Thanksgiving
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.600]   We're asked it's like I'm bored. It's for you. It's four hours till Thanksgiving
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.560]   I bet I could get some work done that way that way I can take Saturday off and go get ice cream for
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.360]   So isn't that cute and you've got a little bunny with you today?
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:27.400]   Also joining us I'm very happy to have Renee Richie here from i'mor.com
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.420]   Which I have I've only recently learned used to be
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.440]   I visor calm and then I
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:42.040]   Visor central and I guess there's no I at the time and then not invented it and then after visor was at handspring
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:48.520]   Central is a central trio central trio. Yeah central and then crackberry
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:53.240]   Yeah, no Android central Android central and I'm more yes
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.960]   All iPhone all the time
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:01.600]   iPhone iPad anything Apple makes with an iron. Oh, okay good. I and more
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:07.020]   I get it. Yes. Well, that's good. That gives you plenty. That's more than enough so to speak
[00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.280]   They also busy company. Yeah, these Apple guys
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.560]   Get busy. They also do it like you guys do a hundred podcasts
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:21.120]   You got the palm cast the crackberry cast the eye more show the Zen and tech show
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.360]   super functional iterate and
[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.040]   Even windows phone central Wow. Yes
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.840]   Wow
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.760]   That's a little slower over there. That's like a couple of guys
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:38.840]   No, they're actually killing it lately. I mean they got the SDK leak and that was that stuff
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.960]   You guys are really good at getting the rumors in fact, that's why you're on because you didn't get screwed
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.560]   I
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.680]   Miss the screwing this is a very good story and I and I'm actually kind of a little teensy
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:57.440]   Weensie bit relieved that the hoax was revealed before this show you probably saw
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   Headlines everywhere Apple creates new screw to protect the keep you from getting into the iPhone
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   What was what happened Renee?
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.560]   You mean what in hindsight or as it will tell as it broke and tell us how you avoided being fooled
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.600]   The story came out that Apple was making a strange
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:25.440]   Lopsided asymmetrical screw head. I mean Apple did transition from a regular screw to a pentalobe screw right to stop people from opening up
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:31.120]   iPhones and I pass and they've had a long history this they they used to torque screws for a while even though they're calm
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.360]   Yeah, not uncommon, but still a little difficult
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:42.080]   And this was an asymmetrical screw so of course no one would have one and I'm guessing I fix it would have to forge some in the fires of
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.080]   Mordor so that the rest of us could
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.760]   So you might see you might have seen these stories like here on the cult of mag not to name names a lot of
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:53.360]   Blogg's got bit as I said I might have been bit Apple maybe working on top secret
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.840]   asymmetric screw to lock you out of your devices forever
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:01.040]   Well, it's a clichÃ© right any companies efficiently large is indistinguishable from evil
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:06.800]   So figure they're out to get us the source and and to their credit cult of Mac
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:15.640]   Points to the source which is a picture on reddit unsourced anonymous a friend took a photo a while ago at that fruit company
[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:21.400]   They are obviously even creating their own screws and this was it this was that this was the tip the lead the leak
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.400]   This is all it took
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.400]   I assumed it was blackberry
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:30.160]   Fruit company yeah blackberries of fruit. Yeah, absolutely
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:34.680]   So why did you not get bit by this everybody else did didn't they?
[00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:39.520]   We're really cautious about posting rumors that we can't source ourselves
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:45.960]   There is some value to posting things that you know or false or things that you think you can add context or value to
[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.760]   But if it's just a screw and it's unsourced and it doesn't make sense
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:53.760]   I don't see a reason why Apple would do this I understand they want to lock you out
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.600]   But that's going to an extreme amount of trouble
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:00.680]   And it's usually almost like security like you're only worth as much money as they will pay to do this to you
[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:03.760]   And it it just didn't pass this NFT test to me. So we
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.960]   Happily avoided it
[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:11.800]   Kyle Wiens at I fix it said if this screw design is legitimate the ramifications would be severe
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:14.840]   But and to Kyle's credit he was skeptical as well
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:22.240]   He said my gut feel is this isn't from Apple the threads are unrealistic. He was the first to point out that in fact
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:26.440]   Physics dictates and this screw is not gonna work
[00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:30.760]   I suspect that a head like that is too complex to use as a tool head existing tool designs
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:35.200]   Tend to be simple because the head needs to withstand a fair amount of torque if this is an Apple design
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:37.200]   It looks like it would be expensive to manufacture
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:45.440]   And in fact it was a hoax perpetrated by a Swedish design company the Swedes as usual
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:49.320]   That's usual. I'm kind of a little mad at this company
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:55.000]   Because this is I don't know. This is a little bit day four dot SE right
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.440]   And not only did they get the reporting then afterwards they said it was a hoax so everyone went back and gave them more
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.880]   I don't like rewarding negative attention
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:06.320]   I think that if people do create things just to get links the last thing
[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:11.440]   I want to do is give them links because it actually validates that business model and not only did they get the links for a crazy
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:16.800]   Story, but then everyone went and link back to them again when they admitted to hoaxing to be a hoax
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:24.360]   It's very close to trolling, isn't it? Yes, and I agree trolls the worst thing you do with trolls is give them any attention at all
[00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:27.560]   However, we are giving them attention. So maybe I should just shut up now
[00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:33.080]   Yeah, well on the other side it feeds both sides of the problem in that
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:40.280]   Someone it's a newspaper that thinks it gets a scoop and sells a million papers because it was hoaxed into doing a scoop
[00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:44.440]   They've got no problem with that all they were caring about was selling the million papers as a matter of fact
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:51.000]   They're grateful. They're grateful that the that they that whoever hoax them pulled the mask off the hoax while it was still an active
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.400]   New story because that way they got to sell out the 750,000 papers the next day
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:09:01.520]   So it's it's it's really it's it points to the difficulty of being in the news business these days because it really is critical to be
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:07.320]   Among the first 20 minutes worth of coverage on a certain story so that you get that you get that Google ranking
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:11.400]   So that when people start to hear about this that you get the link backs you get the you get the search hits
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.560]   It's hard to it's I
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:20.400]   The fact that I've deliberately chosen to be in a job where it's not so important for me to be the absolute first person to report someone
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.680]   That that means that would be kind of wrong for me to fault somebody
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:30.280]   For for wanting to be the first in on that action and to their credit most of the stories that we're linked to
[00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:33.920]   At least we're a little bit circumspect and they're really saying that hey
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:37.280]   Here's a picture of a screw we don't know where it comes from isn't it interesting though?
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:44.440]   And then mean I and I myself when these rumors come up if it's interesting enough to meet for me to spend the first sentence
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:46.240]   Saying okay, who knows if this is true or not?
[00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:51.880]   It's probably not but let's let's have a conversation about the topic of having security screws on a modern device
[00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:53.880]   Does it is there any point to it?
[00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:56.760]   And yeah, at least you can have a nice discussion on that basis
[00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:01.880]   Yeah, and I know I want to emphasize this I am not pointing fingers because we could I could have just as easily
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:06.240]   Been breathlessly bit by this. We only reason we didn't as it happened on a Wednesday
[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:13.500]   And I don't know so that's exactly how devious they were they also chose to release
[00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:18.140]   Information in the same schedule that Apple would as soon as we've done recording this show
[00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:24.600]   But what I do the reason I bring it up and it's not to give credit to this Swedish design blog either give many an additional
[00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:31.440]   Attention, but is to point out how overheated the rumor mill is how difficult it is to know what's a true rumor or not
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:37.960]   And and to remind people that do not believe everything you read and and do trust people like Andy and Renee
[00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:44.680]   Who cover this day and day out and they have a sniff test and if you're if the problem is I think that
[00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:50.880]   Exactly as you say Renee, there's such a prep. There's such pressure and and Andy. There's such pressure to report
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:54.640]   Instantly there's no disincentive really to get it right
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:59.400]   Because you get links either way it drives traffic either way it might be a little embarrassing
[00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:02.040]   and and there's also
[00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:07.800]   When I have not been to journalism school, but I hang out with a lot of people who did get the proper paperwork to do my job
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:12.120]   And and and a lot and a lot of what they study there is not just the techniques
[00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:18.040]   But also here's what your responsibility is to readers sometimes a piece of news comes in and you don't have time to
[00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:22.800]   Lock it down as absolutely true or dismiss it as completely false and you have to make that call
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:28.600]   Should you at least put out the information that there are people who are talking about this topic and sometimes you say
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:30.280]   I don't know if this is true or not
[00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:32.260]   We have to make sure we couch it as completely
[00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:38.120]   Unconfirmed but people are going to be looking to us for information about this topic and we have to be the ones to tell them that
[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:40.200]   Here's what we know, which is not much right?
[00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:44.440]   So there's there's there's ways to fall on the wrong side of the line either way
[00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:49.520]   But sometimes you do have to go forward and say here's what's yours something that is getting a lot of discussion right now
[00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:53.560]   And here's what we know about it as long as you say, you know, this is this as you said
[00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:57.320]   This is the source and it may or may not be credible
[00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:00.640]   The page views sucka I mean
[00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:05.240]   We've done that too in the past when a story is big enough you you almost are compelled because people are talking about
[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:07.320]   Everybody's saying right they want your take on it
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:09.800]   They want to know they want your help to determine if it's true or false
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:16.240]   And I think there is like Andy said a lot of value in the conversation and issues around it even if that specific instance in this case
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:16.760]   In a real story
[00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:23.640]   Cultimac did the right thing and others did the right thing by pointing back to the Reddit story and saying this is the source because that does let readers at least
[00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:30.280]   Decide where I have problems is where and you do this I'm more and I understand why you do it because you can't reveal your sources
[00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:37.360]   You'll say things like a source that has previously been accurate. Yeah, and the problem is there's no way for us to judge that
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:39.560]   You know it comes down to our reputation
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:42.840]   I mean if we get enough right then people will start to give us credibility
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:45.200]   And if we blow a lot of them then we'll lose that credibility
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:50.920]   So we have to make sure that we have a high enough confidence in printing that rumor that we're willing to stake our credibility on it
[00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:57.280]   It's it's also bears mentioning that there especially where apples concerned you can have the story
[00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:00.400]   Absolutely locked. I mean you've got this
[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:05.320]   Story cold but then three weeks before the thing that is inevitably going to happen that you have
[00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:10.760]   Multiple sources multiple paper documentation look the hall has been booked
[00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:20.520]   I got I got into that situation exactly once where it was I had everything and that I knew I also
[00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:25.700]   I also knew that the person who was rumored to be giving this talk the presentation
[00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:32.660]   He actually is unavailable on this day and also that just point after point after point for point where you could not have more
[00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:37.820]   Information that this is going to happen and then just then within two weeks of the things inevitably supposed to happen
[00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:42.340]   It didn't happen that someone got cold feeder decided this was not a good strategic idea for them
[00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:46.720]   And they backed out the last minute so even if you felt this though you were completely confident saying yes
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:49.160]   Here's exactly what's going to happen. Here's the day. It's gonna happen
[00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:54.220]   Here's exactly what's gonna be discussed. You don't know until you know as I say time and time again
[00:13:54.220 --> 00:14:00.380]   I don't believe an apple rumor until Tim Cook is standing on a stage holding it in his hand and being photographed by 500 people and even that
[00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:03.880]   Again, I will exactly I will say
[00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:10.280]   Yes, but I thought it's it's you didn't see the back of it and you know what?
[00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:16.540]   The tablet is just thick enough to be a PES dispenser if it were a PES dispenser, so I'm not gonna completely
[00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:21.520]   I'm 95% sure but not 100% when his head turned the polygons didn't render perfectly
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:26.580]   Well, and it's that's the other side of the coin is you can go too far in being a skeptic
[00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:29.540]   So it's so it's good to be conserved anyway
[00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:36.180]   I say all this is as a prologue to the apple for iPhone rumor roundup which you're about to go into
[00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:38.060]   So let's go on let's go on that
[00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:40.740]   But for but first I'll just say in passing that two days ago
[00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:44.380]   I realized that there was a hole in my life and realize that wow
[00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:50.860]   It's been almost six weeks until anybody has had any interest in talking about iPad mini or Apple TV rumors
[00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:55.220]   Yeah, it just so this so this is how these things go. There's like waves of oh, yeah
[00:14:55.220 --> 00:15:01.120]   Oh, yeah, and sometimes I phone five series or new iPhones sometimes I think I can flake interest and the number of stories
[00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:03.740]   confirming a rumor as
[00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:06.100]   Somehow making it more
[00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:11.100]   Realistic or more believable and I don't even know if that's true because this screw is a good example
[00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:13.860]   I mean all the big blogs all the big Apple blogs
[00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:22.580]   Rorten's point previously. I mean we have there's that famous story of Steve Jobs not liking the plastic screen on the original iPhone and getting changed in a matter of weeks
[00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:22.940]   Yep
[00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:25.860]   They are I think one of the fastest manufacturing companies in the world
[00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:30.540]   So exactly what Andy said until someone on Apple was holding it up on a stage and the press release hits
[00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:31.820]   It's not confirmed now
[00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:36.940]   I have to point out that is not gonna happen again because that was when the iPhone the first came yes
[00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:41.860]   There they know now that the minute they put anything in you know in the in the store
[00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:44.020]   They're gonna have five million orders in the first hour
[00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:48.820]   So they cannot change things on a dime as they used to that they can manufacture the
[00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:51.580]   Launch on a dime though. I mean if it's a new product
[00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:56.900]   They can decide not to launch a new on a new product sure but I think the new iPhone is written in stone at this point
[00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:59.260]   Yes, I think they're probably making it I
[00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:04.540]   Think that at this point if the September 12 rumor is true
[00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:08.700]   And it really does have all the hallmarks of an actual leak as opposed to just an unbiased rumor
[00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:11.540]   Then yeah, they they really have to be committed at this point
[00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:13.540]   But I do think that if Apple
[00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:20.620]   Found a flaw that they felt like they needed to correct or really strongly wanted to correct in the in the absence of any
[00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:25.140]   Actual commitment to ship they would delay a month in order to get that done shows they call them show stuffers
[00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:28.740]   Yeah, yeah, I see advantage to being in September as opposed to October
[00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:31.980]   You know like somebody in the chatroom just said this and I forgot what I know
[00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:37.820]   remember Apple put think secret out of business think secret was the original Apple rumor blog and
[00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:45.580]   Put them out of business by suing them. They haven't done that lately. Is that does that did Apple give up or are these blogs more care?
[00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:48.620]   What is yours? What is Renee? You'd be perfect guy to talk about this
[00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:51.300]   Don't you worry that you'll be think-secreted
[00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:57.620]   You know, it's interesting exactly what you said originally Apple would even send cease-and-desists if companies put up
[00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:04.060]   Leaked parts or leak designs, but I think at a certain point they realized that that just affirms those leaks
[00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:11.220]   It actually adds maybe a layer of credibility to it and by stating silent it becomes much more difficult to sort out the noise from the signal and
[00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:19.580]   This was interesting on Apple's last conference call Peter Oppenheimer was talking about the damage to Apple's financials that leaks about future
[00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:23.340]   iPhones cause to sales of current iPhones and Tim Cook
[00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:29.300]   I don't know if it was a different point of view, but he said that if people were lusting after or wanting future Apple products
[00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:34.100]   He was okay with that as long as they were wanting future Apple products. Maybe that maybe a little
[00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:36.180]   common sense is
[00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:39.780]   Yeah, think secret reported the Mac mini in
[00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:45.100]   2004 it was in fact announced at Mac world in 2005
[00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:51.860]   Apple sued over trade secrets and put the site out of business in 2007 five years ago
[00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:57.420]   If you look at us, I mean we got the September 12th date and originally people weren't certain
[00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:01.900]   But I think within a day and certainly within 24 hours everybody Wall Street Journal the New York Times
[00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:04.300]   Jim Dalrymple at the loop the verge
[00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:08.180]   But how much of that is group think how much of it is saying well Renee is pretty good
[00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:08.900]   I'm worse pretty good
[00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:11.540]   Let's say it's true and how much of it is their own reporting
[00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:17.020]   I mean I have to admit when I hear the times the journal and you guys I'd say well, it's true
[00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:22.020]   But is that wrong? Are you all just is are they all just you know writing on your back?
[00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:26.720]   I I don't think they put it on my back just yet
[00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:30.880]   So they have they're okay. They must say they're really accurate
[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:37.180]   But yeah, but I don't think at any major newspaper would stake their reputation on any other anyone else's sources at this point
[00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:42.740]   I know because I watched Aaron Sorkin show the newsroom and it was very clear that if they didn't have two sources
[00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:44.740]   They were not going with this
[00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:47.220]   So that must be
[00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:49.420]   If it's on TV Leo, it's true
[00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:55.660]   Exactly if it's HBO drama if if there were lifetime channel then there'd be some wiggle of room for belief, but it
[00:18:55.660 --> 00:19:01.340]   This is this is this is it's a TV. It's a it's a story and paper you've got to believe it
[00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:02.540]   Yeah
[00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:06.300]   But yeah, it seems it seems as though in the past year and a half two years
[00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:12.900]   There are sometimes things where you know like when sometimes you look at a painting that you don't know whether it's
[00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:19.140]   Realize that there's a there's a forgery somewhere here one of these five day gods is a forgery and you don't know anything about art
[00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:24.260]   But there's something about number three that says this one has the shape of a forgery
[00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:27.820]   This is not what I expect to see from this artist in the past year and a half two years
[00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:29.900]   There have been sometimes when there are rumors that come out
[00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:33.580]   You don't know for sure you can't pin something down
[00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:39.540]   But it has the shape of something that of information that Apple wanted out there for whatever reason that we can't speculate about and
[00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:44.900]   That's why I tend that's why I'm booking tickets for September 12. Oh you are. Oh, that's the yeah
[00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:48.100]   That's the test I use is Andy flying
[00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:53.340]   It's yeah, and now it now comes down to do I have to pay my own money or I'm gonna talk some money that
[00:19:53.340 --> 00:20:00.020]   We'll fly out. That's a done in that case. It's a done deal. Okay. If you're flying I'm buying
[00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:09.620]   Vacation diamonds September
[00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:15.700]   It's the best time of year to come to San Francisco actually point number one talk about how you never take a vacation point
[00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:17.700]   Oh
[00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:29.620]   Let's take a break we come back

[00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:34.500]   Especially if you're doing like a sales presentation or you're pitching somebody you don't want to make them jump through hoops

[00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:07.540]   Because it I have to tell you I've used it. It's easily the best video but much better than that Skype or anything else

[00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:52.980]   Twitch September 12th
[00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:57.260]   What day is that a Wednesday that is a Wednesday?
[00:22:57.260 --> 00:23:00.900]   We're gonna have to flip-flop our Mac break weekly as usual
[00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:06.300]   Do you think okay? This is interesting do you now remember when the eye the second iPhone?
[00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:09.980]   I think the iPhone was at the iPhone 3 no - 3g 3g
[00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:18.020]   Came out was that 2008 it was I did the 24 hours of iPhone from the cottage remember that nice I
[00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:21.700]   stayed up all night
[00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:29.340]   Talk to people waiting in line and stuff and it hasn't been as exciting really since do you think this new iPhone will be as exciting as that I?
[00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:35.260]   Don't think so for a couple reasons. It's no it's no long remember that there's nothing that existed
[00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:40.660]   About the iPhone before the iPhone existed also. I can't think of any other product including the iPad
[00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:45.260]   That was as heavily height. I mean I for three months
[00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:49.780]   I had a steady schedule of telling people what it was like to actually hold an iPhone in my hand
[00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:54.940]   Use it for you to help one it's because yeah because I had because I had my briefing and I'm talking
[00:23:54.940 --> 00:24:00.180]   I'm talking to like everybody who's like but how what's this gonna be what's that gonna be like and that's just absolutely
[00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:04.260]   Impressive and also remember that now it's no longer such an exotic thing
[00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:07.940]   You see them everywhere and also people can pretty much buy them any day of the week
[00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:15.380]   And thirdly apples running out of great things to do so they could they could come up with a really huge and lovely surprise for everybody
[00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:19.980]   But remember that every subsequent model was oh my god
[00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:24.780]   This is the one that actually uses high-speed data. Oh my god. This is the one that has that incredibly great display
[00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:30.340]   Oh my god. This is the one that has a camera that's as good as any camera that you'll have in your pocket now
[00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:37.900]   If it's based based on rumors a lot of it is like internal hardware stuff that has a benefit to the user but doesn't translate immediately to
[00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:41.940]   You remember remember the old days when you have a phone that you would you would drop it
[00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:47.100]   It would fall on the ground this time you it's like the IS the iPhone I have ISS you basically let go of it
[00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:48.500]   It just simply hovers
[00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:50.980]   You know if they do that I'm doing 24 hours
[00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:55.460]   Phone I'm I'm contractor. No, I'm definitely upgrading for the hover phone
[00:24:55.460 --> 00:25:01.780]   Especially especially if it's like enough propulsion you could put like a small mouse or like a hamster on it
[00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:08.340]   I think that would be pretty awesome having a floating hamster tray. Let's do the rumor rundown say see what we know what we don't know
[00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:10.340]   I think because
[00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:17.140]   You I think I'm more Renee was the first to publish the date September 12th. You're now. Yes, sir pretty much confirming that
[00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:21.420]   Pre-orders this is the new new new bit of information
[00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:26.740]   On that day at least in the US and released nine days later
[00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:30.660]   So but this is kind of how it's been of late. This isn't too much of a surprise
[00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:33.260]   No, but it is same day pre-order last year
[00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:39.860]   It was the event on the Wednesday the pre-orders on the Friday and before that it's varied to a greater degree
[00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:44.500]   So if this is accurate Apple is being very aggressive about getting it out there
[00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:52.140]   You're also saying that you've learned the second wave of iPhone launches international launches will begin in the first week of October likely October 5th
[00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:54.180]   That's pretty quick too
[00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:58.100]   That's I believe that's what they did last year was about two or three weeks later where
[00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:02.580]   But in the last year the iPad 3 and the iPhone 4s
[00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:11.180]   Apple was much faster and much larger in getting phones into international markets than they ever were before and you never know because they're going to a new phone and
[00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:14.540]   Traditionally panels have been a constraint for them like the iPad
[00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:20.060]   It was hard to get those panels even the iPhone 4 was constrained and if they have a new screen you always worry
[00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:22.260]   Are they gonna be able to get enough manufactured?
[00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:24.620]   But if they're being aggressive with it, I think that's a good answer
[00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:28.220]   That's the gating factors in it the manufacturer. Yeah
[00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:34.980]   What else what else are we I'm just gonna do timing first and we'll talk about the actual
[00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:38.300]   Product I think that's all the timing
[00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:46.300]   But we don't know countries specifically just the first round of international the US of course we'll get it first
[00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:47.620]   US first and
[00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:49.220]   Wouldn't that be
[00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:53.180]   Well, I mean Canada I live in Montreal and Canada did get the 4s the same day
[00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:55.820]   But we did not get the 4 we got the 4 several weeks later, right?
[00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:57.900]   Then the US so you never know until they never know
[00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:04.940]   Well, actually that's how it is kind of with the galaxy phones they often ship the note shipped months before it shipped in the US
[00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:09.420]   Well part of part of that was because they didn't know if they'd actually be able to sell it in the US
[00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:13.580]   The Samsung Galaxy 3 was one of the handsets that was being targeted by Apple for instance
[00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:19.180]   So that's why they got the gala that that's that's why a lot of the tech blogs basically went
[00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:21.540]   internationally to get a copy of it that's
[00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:24.900]   What I didn't was released six exactly six to two months earlier, right?
[00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:30.420]   And you know this is gonna be a tough decision for me because of course Samsung is
[00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:38.780]   And we'll get to the trial later, but the battle royale Samsung has announced that they're gonna do the galaxy note - I was a big note fan
[00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:41.420]   August 29th
[00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:47.860]   Yeah, a couple of weeks ahead of the Apple announcement and it will be five and a half inches and and and Sam see Samsung's not holding back
[00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:51.620]   They said it's gonna be five and a half inches and it's gonna be an unbreakable screen
[00:27:51.620 --> 00:28:02.740]   That's actually the one thing that gave me pause I don't care about the breakable unbreakable
[00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:08.700]   But it's a it's a new thin screen almost a flexi screen technology and so that will be interesting
[00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:10.980]   I'll get both of course. I'll get both
[00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:18.140]   Yeah, I'm pleased with how durable it is. I've actually dropped my galaxy three a couple of times and
[00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:21.860]   Had it passed it passed the incompetence test so well
[00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:26.740]   It was Steve Martin who told me I asked him how much how do you like the 4s?
[00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:32.060]   He said well they took a great phone and then they made it out of glass and slippery, but yeah
[00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:35.340]   Was an interesting choice
[00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:37.340]   but
[00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:43.380]   This okay, so we can start talking physicality the newest rumor unibody that would be more certainly more durable would it not?
[00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:50.820]   They would remove the back glass plate from the equation it would have a metal glass a metal plate except for the top and the bottom
[00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:56.660]   Obviously for the radios much like the first iPhone right it was metal back with plastic top and bottom
[00:28:56.660 --> 00:29:02.900]   As far as I know we know that can make radios go through stainless steel everyone else has to use radio transparent materials
[00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:04.220]   Aha
[00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:09.500]   So though they will have to have plastic well yeah, cuz you know you don't you don't want to you don't want to you don't
[00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:14.180]   It's not going to be the iPhone Faraday model where it's not clad and copper sheeting
[00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:18.580]   Never be never be disturbed by unwanted calls ever again
[00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:24.180]   Adimatium vibranium makes perfect for exactly that's see that's what happened
[00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:28.260]   It's not as I'm sorry about to go into a 10 minute description of what's happening in Wakanda in the Marvel Universe
[00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:32.540]   Which would have cared about so is this a credible rumor this unibody rumor?
[00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:39.300]   There's so I think we talked about it last time - there were three prototypes one was a 3.5 inch screen similar to
[00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:41.740]   What it is now one was a four inch green one?
[00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:44.180]   I believe there are two with four inch screens and this was one of them
[00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:50.480]   And you Apple always does that they have I think like they're the cliche is 10 designs three prototypes one release
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:54.380]   And I believe they had until July to decide and based on all the parts leaks
[00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:59.100]   It looks like this is the the case thing they went with a unibody case with a glass top
[00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:04.940]   Plastic top and bottom that would be more durable certainly the glass back was no, but no necessarily
[00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:09.380]   I said this is an area which I recognize how little I know about engineering
[00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:13.820]   I was talking to a couple of engineers about 11 months ago were telling me that he
[00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:21.940]   He he made the argument to me that it's possible that the whole purpose of the glass back with that design was that if you
[00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:28.340]   Happened to drop it and something was going to break if the Apple wanted the $20 sheet of glass at the back to break
[00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:30.540]   The thing that's so easy that could be replaced
[00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:37.260]   No, I'm serious something that could be replaced in like exactly five minutes by anybody with a screwdriver versus the incredibly expensive
[00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:42.540]   Multi-layer display component at the front. I don't I don't know if that's absolutely true or not
[00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:48.980]   But I was trying to figure out why it if he made a case about while here's how here's what happens when you have something
[00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:55.500]   That's that's in a frame of the shock has to go somewhere and unless you unless you basically by choosing materials
[00:30:55.900 --> 00:31:01.740]   Tell the laws of physics please send all this all the please send all the force into this part instead of this part
[00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:06.100]   Anything can happen the same reason why a car is designed so that it would it is designed so that
[00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:11.460]   Parts of it are going to collapse and parts are going to take the damage and leave the center compartment pretty much alone
[00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:18.300]   That makes sense, but it's just it's just an idea. It's not it's not something that I've I don't have an internal Apple memo pointed
[00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:23.380]   At so the so the fact that they've they've chosen if they have chosen this new tub like design
[00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:25.380]   It's not necessarily to make it stronger
[00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:28.020]   Who is it within why?
[00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:33.580]   Well the struck I mean Andy's point is exactly correct in with the iPhone 4 on the iPhone 4s
[00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:38.900]   You could just unscrew it pull the back plate off put on a new back plate the digitizer is much more expensive and difficult
[00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:45.580]   To replace and this might give the actual phone greater structural integrity, but it might be at the expense of
[00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:51.460]   More expensive repairs when and if it does break because well because if anything breaks, it'll be the glass on front
[00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:54.900]   It'll be the front. Yeah, the digitizer right which might be a new in cell digitizer
[00:31:54.900 --> 00:32:02.300]   Which would be one component instead of two layers. Do you think that it's liquid metal or is it just plain aluminum?
[00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:08.340]   No, no, we haven't seen any product of that scale. That's made out of liquid metal that
[00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:13.740]   Especially when you consider the volume of components that Apple that that that provided would have to manufacture
[00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:19.140]   So I don't think that we'll see anything serious like that in liquid metal and in the near future as far as I know
[00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:24.940]   We've barely seen some ejector sounds like exactly and you still don't get them and any and all the phones now
[00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:29.100]   And I frankly don't know why they're any better than anything else, but okay
[00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:37.620]   Motherboard points to and this is from nine to five Mac photos of alleged next generation iPhone motherboard surface
[00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:40.460]   Point to new antennas and new battery
[00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:46.900]   Well, they need they need a new antenna to go LTE and as far as I know they are going LTE with this model
[00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:49.220]   We don't have to trees they have to yeah
[00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:53.940]   Well the question is which countries because you have I think 36 to 38 segments of LTE
[00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:58.140]   Even though the bands are similar the segments are so different that it's very difficult to support
[00:32:58.140 --> 00:33:02.820]   I think you need a nine band radio to support all the LTE segment so the iPad only does
[00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:10.500]   North America US and Canada for LTE they would need three or four different models to make a global LTE
[00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:13.380]   Hence the successful lawsuit in Australia
[00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:19.020]   Apple Apple billing there like that. It's 4g when it's not except in the US and
[00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:24.980]   And you're right Leo. I don't know how much longer Apple can choose to not do an LTE
[00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:28.540]   iPhone even if it has to be a US only edition
[00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:34.940]   The over the next year one of the biggest problems that Apple has to deal with is they have to make sure the people
[00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:39.340]   Their next iPhone is still gonna be an iPhone the because it's not as though
[00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:45.020]   As not as though an iPhone buyer is is a sheep and they're never gonna consider buying anything else
[00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:48.860]   I'm just saying that it's a very very powerful thing when you have something that works great for you
[00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:54.700]   You've been very very happy with if you if you know just like your dad like he he bought that he bought a Ford car because
[00:33:54.700 --> 00:34:00.180]   His last five cars been for is they all worked incredibly well and that's why he's the first dealership
[00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:01.260]   He hits is a Ford dealership
[00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:03.460]   But the first time he breaks that buying
[00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:05.900]   Pattern and then it's two years later
[00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:11.100]   He forgot that he used the the iPhone for the for the first two or three years and now he's more open to try other things
[00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:14.700]   So I think it's if it felt and I think a lot of people are at this stage
[00:34:14.700 --> 00:34:19.140]   You're gonna say why am I if I'm gonna be spending the exact same amount of money every single month for data
[00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:21.300]   Why am I not getting?
[00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:27.060]   Broadband speed data and I think that Apple has to at this point has to get LTE on that phone
[00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:33.900]   Customer retention is way less expensive than customer acquisition in there exactly to Andy's point
[00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:39.980]   They're gonna want that and I think that's also why the screen is going to four inches if if Tim Cook's goal is to sell more phones and
[00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:42.780]   Donnie Ives goal is to make the biggest screen possible
[00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:45.820]   They right now sell about half the phones on US carriers
[00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:50.740]   But some people are gonna choose a bigger screen over Apple some people will choose Apple some will choose a bigger screen
[00:34:50.740 --> 00:34:54.420]   And if they can make a bigger screen, maybe that goes to 55% or 60%
[00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:57.860]   And that's that's a good jump for Apple on a new generation phone
[00:34:57.860 --> 00:35:03.820]   Is it safe to say that Apple is at a unusual juncture that they are starting they do need to start looking over their shoulder
[00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:06.820]   They haven't had to in the past. They had such a lead on everybody else. I
[00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:14.340]   Think so it's every time that I am the sort of person who I will be looking at every time
[00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:18.180]   There's a crowd shot of the Olympics both the opening and the closing ceremonies
[00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:24.940]   I've like here are the people who have spent the voice I was saying and here is here's Renee Williams who has spent
[00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:31.180]   13 years of her 16 years becoming one of the most elite and all the story and I'm thinking okay
[00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:34.680]   What brand of phone? Oh, that's not an iPhone. Okay. I think it's an HTC
[00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:40.860]   But I think it's two generations old and so I'm I really do look at these things and you see the days when if you saw someone with a smartphone
[00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:45.980]   In their hand it was guaranteed. It was gonna be an iPhone. That's long in the past now if I'm on a subway
[00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:52.380]   There's a great there's a larger chance it's gonna be by any other manufacturer if I met Panera if I met another public place
[00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:58.740]   Or people are using their devices iPhone is just another brand that I'm seeing so I think that that indicates
[00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:01.060]   That's not the definitive market research
[00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:07.660]   But I think that that's a data point that I have to consider pretty carefully that if there was a specific panache if there was a specific
[00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:12.500]   Eliteness or attraction to the iPhone. It's not nearly as great as it was just a year ago
[00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:20.460]   I mean I've been walking around with the galaxy three for the past couple months alongside my regular phone and I it's just like having
[00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:23.180]   It's almost like the first year of walking around with an iPhone
[00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:28.100]   I mean at Chipotle I was getting a burrito and I was just checking my mail and and the person is some of my
[00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:32.180]   Oh, is that the galaxy three like wow is it as awesome as everybody says it is? I said yeah
[00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:33.980]   Oh my god, that's my dream phone
[00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:38.340]   I'm like wow someone has just said an Android phone is their dream phone
[00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:44.980]   The world is not is not 180 degrees out of shift with how I understand it to be but I have to pay attention to these data points
[00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:49.160]   And I'm collecting as I go through life well into that point Apple stores have started
[00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:51.620]   price matching iPhone
[00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:54.500]   discounts from
[00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:56.740]   Carriers
[00:36:56.740 --> 00:37:00.980]   So that's something Apple never had to do before they're discounting
[00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:06.540]   The iPhone 4s and 4 models by $49 and one penny, but you have to ask for it
[00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:15.020]   To match the other who else is it best buy that's selling it at that price and this is this is only not online
[00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:17.020]   But only on the retail stores is from MacRumors.com
[00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:22.780]   That may also be because the new iPhones coming yeah, absolutely
[00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:27.020]   Although Apple doesn't traditionally price match, but they seem to be price matching this time. This is a first for them
[00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:32.100]   I'm not sure if it's a first, but it's definitely not not their usual modus upper undi. Yeah
[00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:39.060]   Retail stores have been giving authorization to match discounted prices from approved major retailers and carriers
[00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:42.820]   But you have to ask for it. So if you're going in to buy an iPhone today
[00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:48.380]   Say hey, I want that best buy price or target price or sprint price
[00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:53.220]   sprints sprints the one that dropped it down to 150 for the iPhone 4s 16 gig
[00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:59.580]   I may have done that before I mean the carriers and the retailers have discounted iPhones when the next iPhone was imminent
[00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:02.780]   Apple has not carriers could do that because they're gonna make the money anyway
[00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:08.460]   50 bucks here there who cares we're gonna get 2500 bucks off of you over the next two years and if we can get you now
[00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:10.860]   We got you for two years
[00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:15.460]   Right, let's get you now while we can and that phone will be a hundred bucks in about a month
[00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:18.900]   So they're getting an extra 50 bucks. That's right. Yes, that's exactly right
[00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:24.620]   Here's an interesting article MIT technology review. Somebody's gonna have to explain this to me
[00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:28.460]   The iPhone has passed a key security threshold
[00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:37.300]   So Steve Gibson topic Leo yeah, you know idea this Simpson Garfinkel who is really a good security guy
[00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:42.980]   Apple has crossed a significant threshold technologies the company has adopted
[00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:48.980]   Protect Apple's cuz content Apple's customers content so well that in many situations
[00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:55.860]   It's impossible for law enforcement to perform forensic examinations of this devices seized from criminals
[00:38:55.860 --> 00:38:59.500]   I don't know why I'm laughing at that. I just makes me happy. No, but
[00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:07.620]   They're bad guys, but you're absolutely yeah, but I don't want to look at it my phone
[00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:14.500]   Yeah, we are living in a wood given that all the information that's on the phone and given that how
[00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:19.100]   That these forensic tools are basic consumer products and law enforcement
[00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:22.700]   That's not that's not like you're being suspected of terrorist activity
[00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:30.060]   This phone is being put into a special evidence pouch and sent to a really really super top secret lab in the NSA that only processes eight phones a year
[00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:35.060]   It's like no this you know, this this local police police department spent 18
[00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:40.420]   $100 for this piece of software you stupidly when the officer said hey is that a new iPhone?
[00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:41.740]   Can I see it for a sec?
[00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:44.540]   You don't you don't know that in the in the five minutes
[00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:46.780]   Which he was supposedly checking your license back in the car?
[00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:48.660]   He actually did forensics on your phone, right?
[00:39:48.660 --> 00:39:51.500]   And you might not ever know that that actually happened
[00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:54.300]   I'm not saying that this is happening widespread
[00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:59.420]   But you know that these tools are out there that make it very very easy for an unprotected phone to have all of its data
[00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:04.260]   copied and examined with very very little oversight so if you have if you have a
[00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:11.380]   Police officer or an investigator with a let's say a jaunty view of individual rights
[00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:15.020]   And which I don't which I don't believe is in the mainstream of the law enforcement community
[00:40:15.020 --> 00:40:20.540]   But there are a few of those isolated incidents out there the amount of information that can get off your phone and have very little trouble
[00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:26.540]   And very little time is just on spiring and so this is this is if I turned off the feature
[00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:31.060]   We turn where you wipe your phone after after a ten failed password attempts a couple weeks ago when that
[00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:37.220]   I cloud breach happened I cloud problem happened now. I've turned it back on say I would like to see the idea of like a very
[00:40:37.220 --> 00:40:39.220]   Of a bad lieutenant
[00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:41.620]   Accidentally erasing my entire phone and not being able to get it back
[00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:46.580]   So you're right to laugh it may be disinformation
[00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:55.700]   But according to the Department of Justice's director of the cybercrime lab at the computer crime intellectual property section in the DOJ said
[00:40:55.700 --> 00:41:01.060]   I can tell you from the Department of Justice perspective if that drive is encrypted you're done
[00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:07.620]   When conducting criminal investigations if you pull the power on a drive that is hold is encrypted you have lost any chance of
[00:41:07.620 --> 00:41:10.100]   recovering that data again, it could be disinformation
[00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:12.700]   But
[00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:17.580]   This is Simpson Garfinkel was very I think very good on security issues and so forth
[00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:25.380]   He says Apple security architecture is so sturdy and so tightly woven into its hardware and software that it is both easy for
[00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:30.980]   Consumers to use encryption on their phone and very difficult for someone to steal the encrypted information
[00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:38.060]   That was the old cliche right leave you had physical access. It was game over right and now it's easy enough for consumers to flip
[00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:40.060]   A bit and have full encryption
[00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:47.060]   Almost out knowing anything about it. Yeah, they're using a 256 bit AES encryption
[00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:55.060]   It's unique the AES key in each iPad or iPhone is unique to each device and is not recorded by Apple or any of its suppliers
[00:41:56.020 --> 00:42:01.300]   Burning these keys into the silicon prevents them from being tampered with or bypassed and guarantees
[00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:04.660]   They can be accessed only by the AES engine
[00:42:04.660 --> 00:42:12.460]   So Simpson says what this means in practice is when iOS devices are turned off the copy of the encryption key in the computer's accessible memory is erased
[00:42:12.460 --> 00:42:20.580]   It's no longer preserved. That's why an investigator who gets a suspects phone would have to try all possible keys the task deemed impossible
[00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:23.140]   by the NSA again
[00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:30.580]   That's what they say this is this is the X factor that keeps us buying Apple stuff again and again again
[00:42:30.580 --> 00:42:34.020]   That's the stuff that we we can't really evaluate
[00:42:34.020 --> 00:42:40.340]   So much of the thinking that goes into Apple features, but you know that at some point somebody has thought long
[00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:43.500]   Except for again of these outline cases
[00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:46.780]   Engineers at Apple think long and hard about well if this is going to be secure
[00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:48.820]   We have to make it secure
[00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:55.460]   Here's how to do that and it's being done at the OS level at the at the storage level and at the hardware level all working together
[00:42:55.460 --> 00:42:59.500]   So that if we promise our customers that your data is secure. It is secure
[00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:04.620]   I don't think there's any other company technology company where you have that sort of implicit
[00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:09.780]   Understanding that there's an excellent chance that they didn't that this company did not screw this feature up. Yeah
[00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:13.540]   So well and they did until the three GS came out
[00:43:13.540 --> 00:43:16.540]   But once the three GS was out the pin key
[00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:19.980]   so when you when you use your pin key that locks it and encrypts it and
[00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:24.580]   Unless they can brute force the pin key or you give it to them and by the way
[00:43:24.580 --> 00:43:27.700]   I have to say long for every time I talk to law enforcement
[00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:29.980]   They say well, you know most of the time these guys just give us their keys
[00:43:29.980 --> 00:43:36.420]   You know they want to cooperate they give us the keys so most time. I don't think they're all that worried about it
[00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:39.820]   But here's the deal
[00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:46.220]   The software to brute force has to be run on the phone itself limiting the guessing speed to 80 milliseconds
[00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:48.420]   per pin
[00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:56.660]   Number trying all four-digit pins requires a mere 13 minutes for four digits if the you choose user chooses a six digit pin
[00:43:56.660 --> 00:43:58.700]   22 hours
[00:43:58.700 --> 00:44:01.300]   nine digit pin two and a half years
[00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:04.180]   10 digit pin 25 years
[00:44:04.180 --> 00:44:09.460]   Remember they also added not just the pin you can switch it to an alphanumeric password now as well if you
[00:44:09.460 --> 00:44:11.540]   Would be very effective. Yeah, yeah
[00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:15.940]   And so just you know something that there's no crooks listening to this show
[00:44:15.940 --> 00:44:20.180]   No, they're not but but a
[00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:25.340]   Crook is not gonna and this is the other thing law enforcement always tells me these guys are idiots. This is the
[00:44:25.340 --> 00:44:28.180]   Smart person doesn't become a crook
[00:44:28.180 --> 00:44:30.980]   So I know that everybody's listening this show is a smart person
[00:44:30.980 --> 00:44:35.740]   So but if you have private stuff on your phone and you want to keep it private use
[00:44:36.460 --> 00:44:40.460]   a 10-digit numeric pin or better yet turn on the alphanumeric and
[00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:45.220]   I think eight did eight alphanumeric should be more than enough to lock it down as
[00:44:45.220 --> 00:44:47.980]   Long as it's not you know something they can guess
[00:44:47.980 --> 00:44:52.380]   All right
[00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:55.860]   thinner higher capacity battery 3.8 volts
[00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:58.180]   1440 milliamp hours
[00:44:58.180 --> 00:45:01.220]   You know I have to say when I compare that to let's say the
[00:45:01.220 --> 00:45:04.900]   2500 milliamp hours in a galaxy note or I think the
[00:45:05.660 --> 00:45:09.660]   Max yeah, the razor max. This is my battery here is I
[00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:12.980]   Think it's 2100 milliamp hours
[00:45:12.980 --> 00:45:14.180]   That doesn't sound like a whole lot
[00:45:14.180 --> 00:45:18.100]   But I guess for a 3 and a half inch screen for that little iPhone as that's quite a bit
[00:45:18.100 --> 00:45:24.060]   Yeah, well, it's and also it comes on to how the Apple translates that into actual actual productive life
[00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:26.140]   Right doing a lot of things underneath the hood that might be a better
[00:45:26.140 --> 00:45:29.100]   They don't may not necessarily need a bigger battery to do what they need to do
[00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:33.340]   Yeah, this is 2100 milliamp hours all then they need to cover LTE
[00:45:33.340 --> 00:45:38.940]   They need to cover the bigger screen because it should be according to rumor 11 36 instead of 960 high
[00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:42.660]   And they need to cover the a 5x chip instead of the a5 chip
[00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:44.940]   Those are the three battery drains in a way
[00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:49.620]   This is this is you know kudos to Apple that they're able to get such good battery life on on
[00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:52.460]   Much smaller capacity batteries
[00:45:52.460 --> 00:45:57.340]   Yeah, fourteen hundred forty milliamp hours is not huge by any means
[00:45:57.340 --> 00:46:02.820]   They should have a way better LTE chip on the new iPhone than they had with the iPad 3 right should be maybe an on-die chip
[00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:09.420]   By now, they're saying it'll still probably be the a5 maybe they'll call it the a5x because it'll have a few extra things Kyle is
[00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:14.900]   Kyle, I'm sorry I'm confusing with Kyle wings Renee Richie does that conform with what you've heard?
[00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:21.700]   Well the iPad 3 had an a5x chip and it was mostly the quad core GPU was the big addition to it and
[00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:26.420]   So far Apple has put the previous iPads chip in the new iPhone
[00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:31.740]   They might mess it around a little bit because a smaller doesn't have to push around as many pixels, but it's a good bet
[00:46:32.260 --> 00:46:35.540]   Would they need quite core or maybe they would stick for battery life stick with the
[00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:38.340]   a dole core a4
[00:46:38.340 --> 00:46:42.340]   Well the quad core is only on the GPU and I believe it's only for specifics
[00:46:42.340 --> 00:46:47.340]   I believe airplay uses one of the cores and Apple usually doesn't just put specs in for specs
[00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:50.900]   They don't even tell you the specs. They'll tell you the feature like they won't say NFC
[00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:53.740]   They'll say buy at Starbucks. They won't say quad core graphics
[00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:57.820]   I'll say airplay so they'll power them down and turn them on if they need them
[00:46:58.140 --> 00:47:02.660]   The other thing is that remember that Apple more than any other phone manufacturer there
[00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:05.860]   They don't imagine that you're gonna be using your phone as a handheld device
[00:47:05.860 --> 00:47:12.300]   They also want you to be using it as a feeder of video and gaming for an Apple TV or an Apple space bar TV
[00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:16.980]   Right, so it has to do it. I think it's reasonable to say it has to do everything the iPad 3 does
[00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:22.740]   It's a three if you remember you that if you just use that as a Wi-Fi hotspot. It'll go for 24 hours
[00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:25.740]   Which is well, it's got a lot more room for a man. Oh tea. I take it back
[00:47:25.820 --> 00:47:29.380]   It doesn't have to do everything the iPad 3 does it can't go that long obviously
[00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:40.780]   It does it does suggest kind of a point though is there any reason in which Apple would make their iPhone a little bit thicker?
[00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:43.980]   If engineers came up to them and said that
[00:47:43.980 --> 00:47:48.300]   We need we feel so we need to put LTE and or we need to support this larger screen
[00:47:48.300 --> 00:47:53.660]   The only way to do this is to make it 1.2 millimeters thicker than last year's model
[00:47:53.660 --> 00:48:01.060]   Would that would that be a source of friction or fiction against adding a feature that they were on a little bit on the fence about to begin with?
[00:48:01.060 --> 00:48:04.700]   Mm-hmm the new iPad is a millimeter or so thicker
[00:48:04.700 --> 00:48:08.460]   They were willing to make that compromise, but I think with the iPhone instead of going thicker
[00:48:08.460 --> 00:48:13.340]   It's gonna be a little bit bigger than nine the 16 by 9 screen will make it a little bit taller
[00:48:13.340 --> 00:48:18.740]   So instead of flattening it out the entire length and width. They're just gonna push it up and that'll make more room for the battery
[00:48:18.740 --> 00:48:21.700]   So instead of the thickness you're getting height
[00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:24.060]   This is a little bit more in the
[00:48:24.060 --> 00:48:30.980]   Not far-fetched but less credible rumor this comes from nowhere else dot f r which is a notoriously bad record
[00:48:30.980 --> 00:48:36.460]   One of those things out one of the one of those blue chip dot F R
[00:48:36.460 --> 00:48:39.180]   Yes, I
[00:48:39.180 --> 00:48:43.540]   Can't read French so I'm looking at the Mac rumors story about the nine pin connector
[00:48:43.540 --> 00:48:45.580]   These are
[00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:50.780]   Reportedly pictures of the new connector and you see at the top there's a USB connector just to give you a sense of size
[00:48:51.380 --> 00:48:53.380]   it's small it's
[00:48:53.380 --> 00:48:55.700]   teensy-winkie and
[00:48:55.700 --> 00:49:00.020]   Apparently the one that we're looking at doesn't have nine but has eight pins and
[00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:05.260]   The ring is counted as a ninth the ring is the ninth. Yeah, the ring is the grounding pin
[00:49:05.260 --> 00:49:07.260]   So it is a nine pin connector. I
[00:49:07.260 --> 00:49:13.180]   Do read I've been much else so I do read French and I looked it over and we heard that back in February
[00:49:13.180 --> 00:49:18.540]   We heard Apple was switching to a miniaturized dock the same way they're doing the nano sim and some other things
[00:49:18.540 --> 00:49:22.860]   They want to save as much room for battery as possible, but the pin numbers
[00:49:22.860 --> 00:49:26.540]   I think tech crunch said 19 and I allowed said eight and then
[00:49:26.540 --> 00:49:33.180]   9 to 5 Mac mark german found references in iOS 6 to a 9 pin connector, which sounds right?
[00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:35.180]   It sounds like eight pins plus
[00:49:35.180 --> 00:49:40.100]   The the ring around it and they might be some you might have two sets of eight pins so you can plug it in upside down
[00:49:40.100 --> 00:49:45.820]   Oh, right side up that would be nice because that's a real pain with the micro USB
[00:49:45.820 --> 00:49:48.020]   You got to get it just right and I'm always flipping it around. I
[00:49:48.020 --> 00:49:54.940]   Spent about a day going through 30 pins and the Apple's 30 pin connector is under NDA for their dock partner program
[00:49:54.940 --> 00:49:57.660]   So it's not always easy to find that information about it
[00:49:57.660 --> 00:50:03.100]   But they had a lot of legacy pins they had two reserved pins and they have line in line out left and right
[00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:08.420]   They have a lot of things in their firewire became HDMI so you can't just ditch the old firewire pins
[00:50:08.420 --> 00:50:12.660]   But USB they could get down to four HDMI they could get down to four
[00:50:12.820 --> 00:50:16.900]   They usually have a proprietary pin that detects what kind of accessory it is
[00:50:16.900 --> 00:50:20.220]   So it sounds possible that they could actually get it that small it sounds tight
[00:50:20.220 --> 00:50:23.540]   You know when you just described it four plus four is eight
[00:50:23.540 --> 00:50:30.660]   Plus ground. I mean the proprietary pin. They have room for it. Well, that's USB would have ground data in
[00:50:30.660 --> 00:50:37.540]   And and and power is one of the four USB's is the ground so that's four and then why it needs
[00:50:38.020 --> 00:50:42.500]   Data and it needs clock and these two data two clock and it could share the ground with the USB
[00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:49.620]   So that's got to be four so now we got eight and then there's a special pin that says I am not compatible
[00:50:49.620 --> 00:50:52.260]   Yes, the I am not compatible
[00:50:52.260 --> 00:50:55.540]   Warning of
[00:50:55.540 --> 00:51:02.260]   A special pin devoted only to ruining your day and setting you back to the store for a new $80 speaker dock
[00:51:02.260 --> 00:51:07.060]   So would this give us all the capabilities of the 30 pin port not the analog audio obviously?
[00:51:07.060 --> 00:51:11.780]   We don't need that anymore the 30 pin also had serial in serial out which don't need that people use
[00:51:11.780 --> 00:51:14.940]   But yeah, so they would you would need a better make out box scientific
[00:51:14.940 --> 00:51:22.140]   Instrumentation using the 30-pin port would need that. Yes, I guess it could switch to us. They could use USB instead
[00:51:22.140 --> 00:51:26.900]   Yeah, they would have basically app would be outsourcing that component to the accessory maker
[00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:31.460]   Converting the serial data to USB. Yeah
[00:51:32.260 --> 00:51:36.980]   And maybe HDMI could be broken out into old-style like analog. I don't know if they still do component
[00:51:36.980 --> 00:51:42.900]   Compositing component, but it's theoretically positive. There is a HDMI compatible USB micro USB
[00:51:42.900 --> 00:51:44.620]   port
[00:51:44.620 --> 00:51:46.180]   Yeah
[00:51:46.180 --> 00:51:50.460]   Apple prefers prefers to provide a dongle for the European Union's micro USB
[00:51:50.460 --> 00:51:52.980]   lots instead of
[00:51:52.980 --> 00:51:55.060]   connector, yeah
[00:51:55.060 --> 00:51:56.140]   Yeah
[00:51:56.140 --> 00:51:58.900]   I wonder though. I mean this is USB and HDMI
[00:51:59.500 --> 00:52:03.420]   They could have used a micro it sounds like they could have maybe there's that one extra
[00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:06.500]   I don't work with you pin that we couldn't fit in there
[00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:11.860]   And they also have changed the pins around the 30 pin has changed significantly since it was first introduced
[00:52:11.860 --> 00:52:13.760]   I mean they ditched six firewire pins, right?
[00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:18.340]   And they added four HDMI pins. I still begs the question if they're gonna do a nine pin connector
[00:52:18.340 --> 00:52:20.340]   Why didn't they just do micro USB?
[00:52:20.340 --> 00:52:23.660]   You still have that dock licensing
[00:52:23.660 --> 00:52:26.380]   I mean you could you could theoretically put a lot of stuff in software now to them
[00:52:26.380 --> 00:52:29.900]   You could have a lot of that abstracted out of the actual physical connector
[00:52:29.900 --> 00:52:35.620]   But I think Apple likes to be the what's what's the play this way of putting it the captain of their own destiny? I
[00:52:35.620 --> 00:52:38.260]   Think that's a mistake
[00:52:38.260 --> 00:52:43.940]   Have do we know anything about the adapter the nine pin to 30 pin adapter
[00:52:43.940 --> 00:52:47.620]   We heard there will be one because immediately of course people heard
[00:52:47.620 --> 00:52:50.980]   There's gonna be one if they would be throwing out their their accessories in the garbage
[00:52:50.980 --> 00:52:52.900]   But it sounds like it'll work for cables
[00:52:52.900 --> 00:52:58.060]   It may not work for things that had physical sizes that required the phone plugged in very tightly
[00:52:58.060 --> 00:53:00.980]   But for anything that's a cable or has space for the connector
[00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:04.700]   You would just slip it in between the old dock and the new one tell me how I tell you how many devices
[00:53:04.700 --> 00:53:06.700]   I have where you with a 30 pin dock
[00:53:06.700 --> 00:53:10.980]   That's but that's but that's a very easily mechanically solvable problem
[00:53:10.980 --> 00:53:16.860]   You're gonna see a Kickstarter within three seconds of that releasing here is it here is a little mini
[00:53:16.860 --> 00:53:22.860]   Platform of CNC aluminum that you just simply lay the dot lay the adapter into and will be it'll give you mechanical support
[00:53:23.020 --> 00:53:26.260]   Between whatever you've already docked it into do whatever you're about to add things to
[00:53:26.260 --> 00:53:33.540]   I think maybe I port magsafe - Apple's been doing this historically. Yeah, you know, I know and it works out
[00:53:33.540 --> 00:53:38.500]   It's it's a bummer for when you when you've had this this clock radio for about a year and a half two years
[00:53:38.500 --> 00:53:41.420]   It's been working great. It's a bummer if you've got a hardwired dock in your car
[00:53:41.420 --> 00:53:45.460]   but this is I this is one thing and you know that I'm not a fan of of
[00:53:45.460 --> 00:53:50.100]   Apple indiscriminately decided to drop a popular port
[00:53:50.260 --> 00:53:53.340]   But when it comes to the iPhone when it comes to devices
[00:53:53.340 --> 00:53:57.460]   That's this small where every millimeter of space is so important
[00:53:57.460 --> 00:54:01.260]   So valuable in such a cause of fighting I believe inside of engineering on it
[00:54:01.260 --> 00:54:04.780]   Can we get this area for this can we put this feature in here if we use this chip?
[00:54:04.780 --> 00:54:06.140]   I think that yeah
[00:54:06.140 --> 00:54:08.900]   I mean at some point if they really want to keep moving the iPhone forward
[00:54:08.900 --> 00:54:14.260]   They're gonna have to get rid of that big harmonica connector and they have things like Wi-Fi sync and airplane now
[00:54:14.260 --> 00:54:18.580]   So over the air is handling a lot of what the cable used to and to your point Leo
[00:54:18.580 --> 00:54:23.960]   I think an Apple vernacular it would be an unlike micro USB our connector is symmetrical
[00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:25.960]   So it doesn't so it's easier
[00:54:25.960 --> 00:54:30.900]   That would be what that would be a winning point actually that would I wouldn't that's that's something in its favor
[00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:37.100]   Gizmodo had a piece let me just go back to this and
[00:54:37.100 --> 00:54:40.820]   See where they got it from because I doubt they made this table
[00:54:40.820 --> 00:54:43.500]   That shows all the different pin outs
[00:54:43.500 --> 00:54:47.220]   This is from
[00:54:47.540 --> 00:54:53.660]   I mean those in my experience weren't I went through a ton of them last week and most aren't accurate because the latest version again is under Apple's
[00:54:53.660 --> 00:54:58.500]   Doc partner program nobody can know yeah, no one wants to respond wait a minute
[00:54:58.500 --> 00:55:03.340]   No, no wait a minute now if would it make any difference to you if I told you this was from pin outs. Are you?
[00:55:03.340 --> 00:55:10.780]   No, yeah, they're a good source, but I believe their latest still has the firewire pins which I switch to HDMI okay
[00:55:10.780 --> 00:55:17.060]   Mm-hmm look there's s video. Yeah, I mean there's a lot of garbage
[00:55:17.060 --> 00:55:23.500]   Yeah on here. So I guess I could put on their list as a video port too say a tons of video ports. Isn't that funny?
[00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:26.140]   Well, yeah, remember that I mean yeah
[00:55:26.140 --> 00:55:31.820]   I mean I can remember back to all the things all the weird remember you could connect an iPod to TV with a special
[00:55:31.820 --> 00:55:37.140]   Yep s video doc and all of that and that's all legacy stuff that's still in there
[00:55:37.140 --> 00:55:44.100]   No, but you know what they have I understand it makes a lot of sense you make more room you get rid a lot of legacy that nobody's been using for years
[00:55:46.140 --> 00:55:49.220]   But if and I keep saying this so I'll say it one more time
[00:55:49.220 --> 00:55:56.220]   I'm never gonna say this again if Apple is in fact looking over its shoulder as the little Samsung Galaxy S3's keep catching up
[00:55:56.220 --> 00:56:02.060]   Is this the right time to give Apple users one more reason to make a switch? I?
[00:56:02.060 --> 00:56:06.220]   Don't think so okay
[00:56:06.220 --> 00:56:11.980]   I think that the the the the the central theme of Apple story is always that they're gonna do
[00:56:11.980 --> 00:56:15.300]   they have a clear vision of where they want to go and the product they want to make and
[00:56:16.020 --> 00:56:19.940]   Borrowing real information that this is going to be the like I
[00:56:19.940 --> 00:56:24.740]   Using the Titanic to ship carloads of Edsles across the ocean
[00:56:24.740 --> 00:56:27.020]   Apple's gonna go ahead and do that
[00:56:27.020 --> 00:56:31.180]   I don't and they're they're ready to be proved wrong when they believe in something
[00:56:31.180 --> 00:56:33.740]   But they're gonna go if they really believe that this is the right way to go
[00:56:33.740 --> 00:56:37.980]   They're just gonna go ahead and do it and we are agreed now that it's nine pins not 19. I
[00:56:37.980 --> 00:56:42.140]   Mean if it's really bidirectional are they gonna call it 16?
[00:56:42.140 --> 00:56:45.580]   I mean we'll have to wait and see what they with the language they use for it
[00:56:45.580 --> 00:56:49.820]   But I think again Apple's not gonna tell us how many pins it is. They don't think you could care or worry about that
[00:56:49.820 --> 00:56:52.220]   Yeah, no, it's not I'll just say it works
[00:56:52.220 --> 00:56:55.540]   This is not the interesting thing is you heard they're gonna do it across the line
[00:56:55.540 --> 00:57:00.300]   I think not just on the iPhone 5 but all the iOS devices will be updated to support well
[00:57:00.300 --> 00:57:06.220]   That's the other interesting rumor that they're they'll announce new iPads with this new nine pin connector
[00:57:06.220 --> 00:57:11.980]   Which they've I mean historically they've they switched the infinity on base ban chip mid run on the I forget
[00:57:11.980 --> 00:57:14.420]   It was a four of the 4s and they've they've done small
[00:57:14.420 --> 00:57:19.380]   Technical changes to phones midlife before and it's probably again gonna be oh the new versions
[00:57:19.380 --> 00:57:21.220]   Just have a mic. They're not gonna make a big deal about it
[00:57:21.220 --> 00:57:23.980]   Even if they do other things like improving the thermals or something
[00:57:23.980 --> 00:57:27.100]   They'll probably just say oh it's the same I pad you bought six months ago
[00:57:27.100 --> 00:57:27.980]   You don't have to worry about it
[00:57:27.980 --> 00:57:30.060]   But if you buy it now it has this new connector on it
[00:57:30.060 --> 00:57:36.660]   Yeah, you know my iPhone 4s is such an integral part of my sonos system with the sonos dock and it's how I listen audio books and stuff
[00:57:36.660 --> 00:57:39.660]   I'm just gonna keep my 4s. Yep big deal. I
[00:57:40.740 --> 00:57:42.580]   Don't need a new iPhone
[00:57:42.580 --> 00:57:44.580]   We're gonna take a break come back with more
[00:57:44.580 --> 00:57:50.220]   We've got the lovely and talented Rodei Richie. I didn't realize you're in Montreal. That's cool
[00:57:50.220 --> 00:57:53.700]   That's neat nice city of I'm more calm
[00:57:53.700 --> 00:57:56.460]   Do I have to say a run a Rishi?
[00:57:56.460 --> 00:57:59.420]   Antutale a fancy to you. Oh
[00:57:59.420 --> 00:58:04.380]   Sexy and miss your and they're not go
[00:58:06.260 --> 00:58:08.260]   See, Bruce and Galagia
[00:58:08.260 --> 00:58:12.020]   Well, you're not co is Russian, right?
[00:58:12.020 --> 00:58:16.540]   According to all the Russian people I've ever met yes
[00:58:16.540 --> 00:58:22.580]   They don't when I tell them that my grandparents emigrated from a country other than Russia. They say oh no cannot possibly
[00:58:22.580 --> 00:58:25.660]   Is either Ukrainian or great Russian?
[00:58:25.660 --> 00:58:29.500]   You are all one of us one of us is it's like I said my name is Jablanca wits
[00:58:29.500 --> 00:58:32.180]   But no, there are no Polish people or Jews anywhere in my background
[00:58:32.180 --> 00:58:34.580]   It's like they will not believe that I'm telling them is true
[00:58:35.220 --> 00:58:39.980]   Can not go of course you are Russian you are built for winter
[00:58:39.980 --> 00:58:45.620]   Take a look at him. I got if you put a fleece hat on we did we did take Tovarish
[00:58:45.620 --> 00:58:49.340]   The premier is in wonderful hell
[00:58:49.340 --> 00:58:55.540]   I can see on the wall on the May Day at Red Square going yeah
[00:58:55.540 --> 00:58:58.620]   We're gonna take a break come back with more with Andy
[00:58:59.580 --> 00:59:05.380]   Inotko and the Rene Rishi, but first the word from fresh books the easy
[00:59:05.380 --> 00:59:10.020]   Online invoicing this is this is an example of cloud done right?
[00:59:10.020 --> 00:59:16.940]   When in fact when I first started using fresh books to do my invoicing I didn't even really I don't think the word cloud was in
[00:59:16.940 --> 00:59:19.980]   Wide use I didn't think of it as cloud invoicing. I just thought this is great
[00:59:19.980 --> 00:59:25.220]   You go to fresh books.com you upload your logo prints very professional
[00:59:25.980 --> 00:59:31.980]   Invoice prints now well you can print but what would it emails these invoices and at first I was a little nervous now
[00:59:31.980 --> 00:59:35.740]   Remember this is when I first started using this when they first started in 2004. I thought oh eight years ago
[00:59:35.740 --> 00:59:38.740]   Oh, nobody's everybody wants paper invoices, you know, I was surprised
[00:59:38.740 --> 00:59:43.940]   No, they were very happy with those one of the things I liked you like this Renee currencies no problem
[00:59:43.940 --> 00:59:50.020]   So if I was invoicing Rogers in Canada, which I was I could do it in Canadian dollars. I'm actually made the conversion
[00:59:50.020 --> 00:59:51.340]   I loved that
[00:59:51.340 --> 00:59:58.740]   And now one of the things I really like about fresh books is that that email has a pay now button and
[00:59:58.740 --> 01:00:03.860]   I'll tell you it turns out your clients actually do want to pay you who knew
[01:00:03.860 --> 01:00:10.700]   It's just as much of a pain for them to pay you as it was for you to print out and mail invoices
[01:00:10.700 --> 01:00:12.700]   So if they have a pay now button they pay
[01:00:12.700 --> 01:00:18.680]   So it saves you time with easy invoicing creation and it by the way preserves the invoice
[01:00:19.540 --> 01:00:23.820]   So you can just you know for each month new month. You just new month if you do hours
[01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:25.780]   It's great for that they have an iPhone app
[01:00:25.780 --> 01:00:30.740]   But they also have a web app that will do time and hours and then automatically put it in the invoice
[01:00:30.740 --> 01:00:35.340]   So you don't have to do any calculations as I said the currencies makes that easy as well
[01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:42.460]   You get paid faster because of the online payments if that you have a client is slow pay no problem
[01:00:42.460 --> 01:00:48.740]   They automatically will do invoice follow-ups. You could set that up in seconds and you never you know
[01:00:48.740 --> 01:00:51.740]   You can always see from your dashboard who owes you money who's paid
[01:00:51.740 --> 01:00:59.300]   So this is really really slick and very professional. You're just gonna love fresh books for small businesses. This is a
[01:00:59.300 --> 01:01:07.780]   Fabulous fabulous thing. I want you to try it right now three and a half million people like me
[01:01:07.780 --> 01:01:12.060]   Discovered fresh books and abused it and I want you to join that group

[01:01:38.420 --> 01:01:44.900]   Tell you it was just a lifesaver when I discovered it freshbooks.com and if they ask
[01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:47.020]   I don't know if they ask if they ask just say hey
[01:01:47.020 --> 01:01:48.420]   I heard it on Macbreak
[01:01:48.420 --> 01:01:51.500]   That way everybody will be happy happy happy happy
[01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:54.660]   Sad to say you know one of the things that we learned
[01:01:54.660 --> 01:02:04.700]   On Steve Jobs death last year was that he had chosen for his kids to have a kind of normal house in normal suburban Palo Alto
[01:02:04.700 --> 01:02:09.500]   And you know they lived comfortably, but they weren't behind a wall and
[01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:12.540]   Now I'm sad to say
[01:02:12.940 --> 01:02:17.180]   I have to admit when I saw the house, I thought oh yeah, it just seems like he should have had
[01:02:17.180 --> 01:02:19.900]   Something he should have had a wall
[01:02:19.900 --> 01:02:24.820]   A gate something nothing and and nothing ever happened while Steve was around but
[01:02:24.820 --> 01:02:33.700]   Apparently in July the house was burglarized a thief still $60,000 worth of computers and personalized items
[01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:40.900]   Good news, you know, you know nobody was hurt of course and they do have a suspect who was arrested
[01:02:41.060 --> 01:02:46.700]   By the Silicon Valley hot tech crimes high tech crimes unit
[01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:50.100]   Is and is in jail waiting a court date later this month?
[01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:54.540]   It doesn't sound like Steve Jobs's house was targeted. It was just part of an ongoing
[01:02:54.540 --> 01:03:01.980]   I think this had 63% increase in burglaries in the in the community. They asked him. They said did you know that was Steve Jobs house? He said no really
[01:03:01.980 --> 01:03:07.020]   Oh, I was listening to Macbreak quickly the other day
[01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:13.420]   And they said the house was easily accessed. No, he didn't know that he had no idea
[01:03:13.420 --> 01:03:18.500]   He just said no, I saw a house and I I went in I'm telling you they're not the smartest people these crooks
[01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:21.340]   Not the smartest people
[01:03:21.340 --> 01:03:24.300]   Gosh
[01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:27.140]   I most don't want to start this conversation
[01:03:27.140 --> 01:03:28.380]   the
[01:03:28.380 --> 01:03:35.020]   Apple's case has rested Samsung now begins it's a portion of the trial the Apple versus Samsung
[01:03:35.020 --> 01:03:36.940]   lawsuit
[01:03:36.940 --> 01:03:40.820]   Every week now we should make a special, you know like night line style
[01:03:40.820 --> 01:03:45.340]   Apple versus Samsung day 7
[01:03:45.340 --> 01:03:52.820]   Yeah, we should make it more like the Olympic coverage. There should there should also have been an opening ceremonies and a closing ceremonies
[01:03:52.820 --> 01:03:54.820]   We're parading of the lawyers
[01:03:54.820 --> 01:04:00.100]   Chariots of fire there are as many lawyers as there were nations in the Olympics. I believe
[01:04:00.100 --> 01:04:03.060]   Paul McCartney would still say hey, Jude at the end of it
[01:04:05.540 --> 01:04:07.540]   Yes, oh
[01:04:07.540 --> 01:04:10.540]   So
[01:04:10.540 --> 01:04:17.740]   This is it's yielding a treasure trove of documents lots of interest stuff anybody who's interested in not only the history of Apple
[01:04:17.740 --> 01:04:23.380]   But also just the philosophies of Apple how they what their priorities are how they develop products
[01:04:23.380 --> 01:04:29.900]   We're just getting boatload after boatload of primary documents being offered up by Apple directly and also
[01:04:30.180 --> 01:04:34.620]   testimony from the key players and most of the decisions Apple making the past four or five years
[01:04:34.620 --> 01:04:40.500]   It's like I've got a folder of PDF after PDF after PDF that you know, I do research for what I write
[01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:45.380]   I do research for the show but more anything else is like I really want to this is fascinating stuff
[01:04:45.380 --> 01:04:47.420]   I want to read all of this right? I hope this
[01:04:47.420 --> 01:04:53.900]   I mean like Apple does not just open the kimono and it shows that I think you whether you agree with Apple or not the
[01:04:53.900 --> 01:04:57.140]   The passion they have in prosecuting this case that they are willing to show
[01:04:57.500 --> 01:05:00.900]   historical documentation that they probably would never ever have shown otherwise
[01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:07.340]   Yeah, this really is the equivalent of of you know, the of the mayor saying I could not have possibly
[01:05:07.340 --> 01:05:12.460]   Murdered that person because I was in bed with my hooker prostitute mistress at the time
[01:05:12.460 --> 01:05:16.380]   Wait, wait, I didn't see that PDF where
[01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:23.340]   See that's why you don't just read the summaries you see on the blog you actually have to download but it's pretty
[01:05:25.580 --> 01:05:29.100]   I'd like I'd like to introduce exhibit double a like
[01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:37.300]   So Apple wants two and a half billion dollars. This is interesting. They say now
[01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:41.220]   We didn't just make that number up. It took literally what do they say millions of
[01:05:41.220 --> 01:05:48.140]   calculations yeah and millions of dollars and millions of dollar like two and a half million dollars to figure out how much Samsung owes us
[01:05:48.140 --> 01:05:54.180]   It also was interesting because they pointed out that they tried to do a license with Samsung and oh, yeah
[01:05:54.180 --> 01:05:57.580]   I broke down that they have three kinds of patents the kind of
[01:05:57.580 --> 01:06:05.580]   standards essential friend patents and the computing patents and the design patents and they are incredibly low to license out anything that they think gives them a
[01:06:05.580 --> 01:06:08.620]   Distinctive or competitive advantage and according to them
[01:06:08.620 --> 01:06:11.580]   They believed Samsung was an important manufacturing partner
[01:06:11.580 --> 01:06:14.700]   So they went there and they broke down sort of this is how much you owe us
[01:06:14.700 --> 01:06:22.580]   But we'll give you 20% off because of our deal with Microsoft and 20% off because we like you and it was it was very odd from an apple point of view
[01:06:22.580 --> 01:06:25.620]   Yeah, and that Microsoft had licensed these pens
[01:06:25.620 --> 01:06:30.180]   But the deal was they could which might tell you something about cross-laces
[01:06:30.180 --> 01:06:34.420]   But tell me tell you something about why the eye-wink does phone looks like it does the deal was you can use these
[01:06:34.420 --> 01:06:37.580]   But it can't look anything like an iPhone and for the better
[01:06:37.580 --> 01:06:39.980]   I mean you put in I love the new the Lumia 900
[01:06:39.980 --> 01:06:44.940]   It's fantastic looking and I even like Android slight to unlock because they couldn't do what the iPhone does
[01:06:44.940 --> 01:06:49.260]   I think there's a case to be made that things that don't look the same or better for us as consumers
[01:06:49.260 --> 01:06:56.620]   Yeah, I did it, you know, I've been giving Microsoft a huge amount of credit for saying thinking differently and doing something different with the Windows phone
[01:06:56.620 --> 01:06:58.740]   Maybe they had to
[01:06:58.740 --> 01:07:05.660]   They wouldn't have done that if they felt I think Samsung and Microsoft were both in the exact same position where they had
[01:07:05.660 --> 01:07:09.020]   Here's the here's the amount of exposure that we have we had to fight this out in court
[01:07:09.020 --> 01:07:14.660]   How how how attached are we to the idea of doing something that is vaguely similar to an iPhone?
[01:07:14.900 --> 01:07:19.980]   If Microsoft said that we can certainly agree to this because we weren't playing on doing anything like that anyway
[01:07:19.980 --> 01:07:27.020]   That's perfectly fine if Samsung says no, we're not we're not doing anything that any other tech company is not entitled to do
[01:07:27.020 --> 01:07:35.380]   You know go go go beat bricks and so and the one of the PDFs that was talking about is the the proposal document the presentation that Apple made to Samsung
[01:07:35.380 --> 01:07:39.640]   At the point which they're saying look we know we know that you stole the stuff from Apple from iPhone
[01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:44.820]   We don't want to go the go to the mattresses over this because we count on Samsung as a trusted and valuable supplier
[01:07:44.820 --> 01:07:46.820]   So here's how we're gonna broke and broke with this truth
[01:07:46.820 --> 01:07:48.700]   And so you click on this time
[01:07:48.700 --> 01:07:50.860]   So it's not good because they tried to keep this out of the courts
[01:07:50.860 --> 01:07:57.380]   But then you look at article after article after article in this presentation where they are essentially saying that any phone that
[01:07:57.380 --> 01:08:04.240]   Does not a flip phone with an liquid crystal display and a and a and a and a 10-digit pad isn't fringing on the iPhone
[01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:10.680]   If you there's a table on page like 18 I've gotten in front of me right now that essentially says that breaking down
[01:08:10.680 --> 01:08:16.560]   How much that the licensing should be for the year 2010 and Apple was expecting that?
[01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:19.280]   Samsung owes Apple
[01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:25.680]   53 million dollars off of Symbian phones the I mean my books for Windows blackjack
[01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:32.280]   Yeah, it's like well like there's the breaking it down say here's if it runs Android then we you owe us money
[01:08:32.280 --> 01:08:34.440]   If it doesn't use a Microsoft operating system
[01:08:34.440 --> 01:08:40.280]   You owe us money there is almost no metric in this document in which Apple says you can sell a cell phone
[01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:44.740]   That is in any way could be called a smartphone and not oh Apple money
[01:08:44.740 --> 01:08:51.160]   I mean this is a document that pretends as though the trio never existed that per that pretends that the blackberry phone never
[01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:55.760]   Existed even again even these phone even these phones that have an integrated keyboard at some point
[01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:57.040]   Well, we'll give you a discount
[01:08:57.040 --> 01:09:00.680]   But you still owe us money because it has a color screen it could do other things
[01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:07.000]   I think there's almost a quote from the presentation that anything that any phone that is more than just a phone at some point
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:10.280]   You need to give us some money for this I do think that that is however
[01:09:10.280 --> 01:09:14.040]   That's when you walk into the car dealership and make the incredible lowball offer because you know
[01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:17.360]   It'll never be accepted but you want to set up a good bargaining position
[01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:24.320]   And I think also what you said about Microsoft versus Samsung the big difference is that Microsoft is funded almost entirely by Windows and
[01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:29.080]   Office money where if you look at who makes money in Android there's Samsung
[01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:35.880]   HTC makes almost none and everybody else loses money. So from Microsoft not copying anything from Apple's probably
[01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:37.000]   You know doesn't matter
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:43.560]   But for Samsung if they believe that being the being an iPhone not made by Apple is the reason they're making
[01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:50.680]   The amount of profit that they're making they will never ever ever want to give that up because that to them becomes the reason for their success
[01:09:50.680 --> 01:09:52.960]   But there's but there's also
[01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:54.280]   there's
[01:09:54.280 --> 01:09:57.720]   This is a great topic for discussion because so much of this is
[01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:03.880]   Conceptual so much of this is debatable and trying to understand what invention is like and what developing a product is like
[01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:07.680]   There is certainly a position to be argued especially with it with the
[01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:13.680]   2010 Samsung Galaxy that Samsung said if there's any idea that we like from the iPhone even visually
[01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:20.960]   We will simply take and put into our phone on the another way to read these documents is to simply say that if someone came up to your
[01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:25.880]   You know your your hamburger stand if McDonald's came up to your hamburger stand and said we don't want to sue you
[01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:31.280]   But we came up with the idea of a meat patty and in middle of bread with vegetables and cheese
[01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:35.160]   That's ours now we do again because we we don't want to be bullies here
[01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:38.900]   If you just give us eight dollars for every hamburger you sell we can settle this out
[01:10:38.900 --> 01:10:40.900]   I think Apple wanted 30 bucks didn't they?
[01:10:40.900 --> 01:10:45.560]   30 for a 40 for a tablet. Yeah, I don't know what the note would be
[01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:48.840]   Yeah, it goes there's actually again
[01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:53.200]   It's it's a it's a great PDF because it really does break down what they think there is in an
[01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:56.920]   wonderful 30 dollars a phone is a lot and by the way
[01:10:56.920 --> 01:11:00.160]   We would pay for that because they just build that into the price of the phone
[01:11:00.160 --> 01:11:03.800]   What was really interesting for me though is that I was trying to think about Samsung, you know
[01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:06.920]   They enter a lot of markets. They don't just make phones or consumer electronics
[01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:12.880]   They make refrigerators and almost anything you can imagine and I was thinking if Samsung decided to get into the refrigerator business
[01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:18.480]   They would look at refrigerators and make something like it because familiarity is a feature you ever seen in a Samsung refrigerator
[01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:21.360]   It looks just like general electrics, but what I found out
[01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:25.520]   I was corrected by some of our readers who said that you actually have to license refrigerators
[01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:31.800]   You have to license French doors and you have to license freezers at the bottom and it is exactly like the consumer electronics business
[01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:35.160]   Wow, all right now. We've only heard by the way
[01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:43.320]   Apple rested on what Friday and now month starting this week Samsung is testimonies begun
[01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:47.280]   So remember we've only heard the first, you know the Apple the pro Apple stuff
[01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:52.240]   We're gonna hear testimony in Samsung's favor. In fact yesterday. They began their defense
[01:11:52.240 --> 01:12:00.240]   With witnesses a pair of witnesses who created technology similar to the Apple patents well before the Apple iPhone
[01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:06.840]   You could tell if you look at it. I'm showing a picture of the HP I-Pack and something called the I-Mate smartphone
[01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:09.960]   that had rubber banding
[01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:15.360]   Pinch to zoom launched. This is UI zooming. This came from Microsoft actually
[01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:20.000]   The thing that's interesting though too is I mean there's gonna be a legal definition of steel of copying
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:21.920]   Is it a legal copy or an illegal copy?
[01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:28.360]   And I think some people want to pretend that Apple's completely wrong or Samsung is completely wrong and there's no middle ground
[01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:30.640]   And I think for example if you look at HTC or Motorola
[01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:36.680]   That's a very different case than Samsung you look their cables look like dock cables are AC adapters look like Apple AC adapters
[01:12:36.680 --> 01:12:40.880]   The blackjack looked like a blackberry before Apple even came on the market
[01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:44.480]   And I think you could make a case that Samsung might have gone a step too far
[01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:47.840]   Maybe it's not to the extent Apple said but maybe it is a step too far
[01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:51.760]   But and you want to find some middle ground in between is the jury given that option?
[01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:54.160]   Doesn't the jury have to find one way or the other?
[01:12:54.160 --> 01:13:00.640]   Isn't it black and white or can the jury I guess the jury could say well we find in favor of Apple would give you a penny
[01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:05.320]   Or we get we know these patents were violated this trade dress was violated, but not this one
[01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:09.840]   All right, well, you know, it's too early to do this, but I'm gonna do it anyway
[01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:17.240]   We're gonna have a straw poll. I like these straw polls so straw poll dot me thanks to Dan Dierks for writing this
[01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:22.760]   He wrote it for NSFW, but we're using it a lot straw poll dot me slash 23 10 if you
[01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:28.880]   Did and I understand we haven't heard from Samsung yet, but you if you were on the Apple versus Samsung jury
[01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:32.780]   Would you give Apple the win and two and a half billion?
[01:13:32.780 --> 01:13:34.880]   whoops
[01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:40.040]   Yes Samsung stole from Apple. I know I know this isn't how the choice is gonna come down, but
[01:13:40.820 --> 01:13:44.820]   No Samsung innovated it didn't copy. I'm sorry. I was asleep. What did you say?
[01:13:44.820 --> 01:13:51.760]   So those are your three choices. I think three favor three, you know reasonable choices now
[01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:56.960]   Of course, we're watching this is Mac break weekly and I would fully expect the Macintosh crowd to
[01:13:56.960 --> 01:14:00.360]   Fall and you know, it's interesting though quite it's
[01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:05.740]   Well, we'll let the votes continue. I'll tell you what we're gonna do it. We'll pause for commercial
[01:14:06.280 --> 01:14:12.600]   Continue to vote straw poll dot me slash 23 10 and when we come back from the commercial, we'll see
[01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:15.120]   We'll see what you the jury
[01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:19.080]   Would say I don't know I wouldn't want to be put in that position to be honest
[01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:23.760]   I would I would I would love to review as Andy has all the documents first
[01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:29.460]   What I would like Leo is I mean I owned a G1 I owned a Texas one
[01:14:29.460 --> 01:14:31.280]   I own the Nexus 7 now
[01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:35.320]   I'm not attracted to Samsung phones because I think Apple does that kind of phone better
[01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:38.080]   And you can again people can like or not like Apple
[01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:44.720]   But if you look at the iPod the Mac the command line interface with the Apple - Apple has this a history of making products that are
[01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:48.560]   Breakthrough at a consumer level and even Sony with the trinitron and the Walkman
[01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:51.720]   I want Samsung to make that kind of universe-denting product
[01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:54.720]   I want them to not just make a technically superior phone
[01:14:54.720 --> 01:14:58.320]   But I want them to take their place amongst the giants of consumer electronics
[01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:04.040]   And I think this might be a good chance for them to do that with a galaxy for or whatever they like the galaxy three plenty good
[01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:08.720]   I don't know, you know, I think that I think the galaxy three is a distinct product
[01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:11.800]   We talked for a Mac show we talk a lot about this
[01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:13.760]   We don't need to talk so much about it
[01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:15.560]   I'm a little bit continued to talk about it
[01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:20.600]   But what I would like to see on the same vent is I would like to see Apple make some
[01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:25.440]   Acknowledgement that even the iPhone was built on the inspiration of successful products that came before it
[01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:30.200]   They did not but what when I was reading through this the the document that came across yesterday
[01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:35.640]   Page after page after page seemed to create the impression that there was you know
[01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:39.240]   That 75% of all all cell phones had actual
[01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:46.360]   Extendable handset with a curly cord that went to the rest of it until Apple came in and sold everything for everybody
[01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:52.440]   Yeah, and as opposed to know again, there was a whole family of big screen like full-screen
[01:15:52.440 --> 01:16:00.440]   Stylo space but still touch-based computers before then the concept of a machine of a phone that is far far more of a phone and more
[01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:02.840]   of a hybrid between a computer and a phone had been
[01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:08.120]   Had been set into bedrock while they were developing the iPhone before they actually went out with it
[01:16:08.120 --> 01:16:11.480]   The the helpful thing that comes comes across from that document
[01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:15.880]   I think this I really think it's one of the key documents that's come to light in the past week is that
[01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:18.200]   very correctly
[01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:22.600]   Apple's philosophy here is that while developing the iPhone they were
[01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:28.600]   Planting crops and those crops being the patents that are associated with this type of a device
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:35.560]   And they're feeling I think as the after the release of the iPhone is that they planted these seeds
[01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:40.120]   They tilled the soil they watered it they tended the plants now the crops have come in now
[01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:43.240]   They've got corn as high as yellow fence. I this is now
[01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:45.880]   It's it's time to harvest so to speak
[01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:51.080]   Uh, which is not not to say that they want to their purpose is to stick up everybody like like they're patent role
[01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:57.480]   But they feel as though the reason why they tended to these crops so carefully is so that they could use this for their own
[01:16:57.880 --> 01:17:02.440]   Their own advantage so that if someone came up with a product that was they felt was too similar to the iPhone
[01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:07.560]   Let's set aside the emotional question about whether it was stolen or not stolen whether it's just evolution or whatever
[01:17:07.560 --> 01:17:11.480]   When if someone comes up with a product that is too that is uncomfortably similar to the iPhone
[01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:16.840]   They have this wonderful field of resources that they can use to try to get some pressure to you know
[01:17:16.840 --> 01:17:18.840]   Kind of get again the ease off on that a little bit
[01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:22.760]   Yeah, I don't think that I don't think it's hatred. I don't think that it's they're trying to bully anybody
[01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:26.680]   I feel as though again, they've got bushels and bushels of corn then now they're gonna be
[01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:29.160]   Now now it's time to now
[01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:32.280]   I was gonna say something make a joke that was a really good pun
[01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:35.320]   But about something that you do with corn, but I'm not gonna say that
[01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:43.080]   I do apple said that I do they were just upset that google gave it away to everybody and that was the the crux of their
[01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:45.800]   Well, I guess if steve jobs is impetus
[01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:51.560]   Pursuing and well there was zero ox park before there was mac apple is just good at taking existing technologies and making them
[01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:59.560]   Main I don't know if it changes the case or not, but I mean apple took notifications from android and put it in the ios 5
[01:17:59.560 --> 01:18:01.000]   I mean it
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000]   I think there's cross-pollination
[01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:10.840]   The real question comes to me down to me with to to something that we can't know which is intent if apple merely wants to harvest its corn
[01:18:10.840 --> 01:18:16.600]   Fine if apple wants to put sam sine out of business. I'm not so happy about that
[01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:20.920]   I think michael's i guess i guess android more expensive and apple wants to make it yes less usable
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:24.680]   And that's how they both want to reduce competition and I think that that's not okay
[01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:28.440]   I think it's fine to say I want to license it we invented it you should license it
[01:18:28.440 --> 01:18:32.600]   But I don't think it's okay to say oh we want to put you out of business because we don't like the competition
[01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:38.920]   You know, I'm I'm largely reacting to remember remember how years and years and years one of the one of the clubs in the in the bag of the person
[01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:42.280]   Who wants to convince people that apple is not a great company is that oh well
[01:18:42.280 --> 01:18:46.520]   They're one great thing they did was that was influential was the macintosh and they stole that from zero ox
[01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:50.600]   And you have to raise your hand and say well no they didn't I mean first of all they licensed it
[01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:55.880]   Well, hey, they licensed it, but if you compared what they were exposed to to what they built inspired by that
[01:18:55.880 --> 01:18:57.880]   The two things are have some superficial
[01:18:57.880 --> 01:19:03.320]   Interactions, but they're not they didn't steal anything from anybody similarly
[01:19:03.320 --> 01:19:07.160]   I think that when you look at a sufficiently when you look at let's let's expand this beyond android
[01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:12.840]   One any one of the devices that apple in this document claims is stolen for it has apple technology
[01:19:13.160 --> 01:19:17.560]   I just feel the exact same sort of reaction as I did when I when I was defending apple against the saying well
[01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:19.080]   No, this is really no
[01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:25.080]   It's very very little similarity between this iPhone and this device you're saying was stolen from my phone and the from from apple
[01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:30.840]   Is it generator of licenses? So that's this is a lot way I get a little bit a little bit my iris a little bit
[01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:33.480]   When I talk about this sort of stuff
[01:19:33.480 --> 01:19:36.600]   Samsung makes it harder though. I mean with HTC and Motorola, I think that's absolutely true
[01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:41.000]   But like the the photos icon apple uses a sunflower on a blue background
[01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:44.760]   So Samsung uses a yellow flower on a blue background. That's totally arbitrary
[01:19:44.760 --> 01:19:49.800]   And those are little silly things that I think when you take you add the dock cable you add the ac adapter
[01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:54.360]   You add the chrome book that looks like a magnum when taken as a whole. I think that's how apple presents the case
[01:19:54.360 --> 01:19:57.000]   Oh, I mean
[01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:58.520]   It's this is I
[01:19:58.520 --> 01:20:00.040]   Did see the testimony from mr
[01:20:00.040 --> 01:20:06.600]   Mm is care and it's a had never realized that the icon that sam's like had chosen for their photos app was a sunflower
[01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:09.960]   Until someone said that it's a sunflower. I mean there. It's a yellow flower
[01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:14.040]   That's looks completely different from the icon that's on the iPhoto
[01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:15.800]   Yes, it's an arbitrary decision
[01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:21.960]   But if you're really getting down to if you're getting down to that not talking about the original music icon that was pretty much a
[01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:29.400]   Perfectly blatant swipe, you know, then you're saying I were really going to argue that you're not allowed to use a three-quarter view of a yellow flower
[01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:33.960]   Because we used a pulled back version of a centered sun really doesn't look the same
[01:20:33.960 --> 01:20:39.880]   Again, it's no reason to use that icon and you should there's no reason this is not reason not to me
[01:20:39.880 --> 01:20:41.880]   If if I wish that
[01:20:41.880 --> 01:20:43.240]   I'm sorry
[01:20:43.240 --> 01:20:45.240]   I'm about to talk out of my depth here
[01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:49.560]   One of the problems of all of us trying to follow this is that we're not there in the courtroom
[01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:52.440]   We're not seeing the entire story that's being told by both sides
[01:20:52.440 --> 01:20:54.520]   And so it's very very easy
[01:20:54.520 --> 01:20:56.520]   I'm trying not to fall victim to this
[01:20:56.520 --> 01:21:02.680]   My own, you know, again getting reacting to this and people disclaimer disclaimer. We are in the courtroom
[01:21:02.680 --> 01:21:06.600]   We're not the jury. We're not going to make the decision, but we can have an opinion about it
[01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:13.480]   Uninformed as it as we choose to be and you sounds like you more informed than most and you've actually read the documents
[01:21:13.480 --> 01:21:20.200]   I'll actually if I think that here. I think I can pull this up pretty quickly. There is a yeah, there is a
[01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:23.880]   I'm preparing like somebody not my writing. I'm looking at different quotes
[01:21:23.880 --> 01:21:26.520]   I'm actually reading I actually find myself reading about
[01:21:26.520 --> 01:21:29.160]   authentication of old masters
[01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:34.120]   About that when they when I knew Leonardo da Vinci sketch turns up and now there's an argument whether it exists or not
[01:21:34.600 --> 01:21:38.760]   Um, there is a quote that I pulled up. I'm just pulled I just pulled it up from from my my notes
[01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:43.960]   This is before so martin camp provides a telling summary an epilogue to the slew of evidence presented in this section
[01:21:43.960 --> 01:21:50.120]   For as a unique moment of realization with art historical with discourse. This is this is a quote from a professor martin camp talking about
[01:21:50.120 --> 01:21:53.320]   Uh a recently discovered linearity Vinci
[01:21:53.320 --> 01:22:00.280]   No single piece of evidence proves conclusively that the portrait of the woman in profile and color chalks was executed by linearity Vinci in the mid-1490s
[01:22:00.360 --> 01:22:02.360]   But the city is bia bianca sportsa
[01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:08.840]   The now secure position of the portrait of mona lisa in liana's body of autograph paintings depends on and this is the money quote
[01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:15.960]   An accumulation of interlocking reasons and not least on the way that the painting participates and how we actively see lianardo as a whole
[01:22:15.960 --> 01:22:20.600]   And I think that that that that kind of struck me because that's where it's going to come down to it's going to be
[01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:28.840]   The entire body of interlocking evidence and also how does this thing that sam song create participate in how we perceive sam song
[01:22:28.840 --> 01:22:33.800]   How does this thing that apple build participate in how we foresee apple as as an entity?
[01:22:33.800 --> 01:22:38.600]   So this is why you know, I watched i watched more olympics than i would care to document but
[01:22:38.600 --> 01:22:40.360]   uh, i'm
[01:22:40.360 --> 01:22:43.640]   The the same sort of obsessive like oh i kind of see this event
[01:22:43.640 --> 01:22:47.480]   Oh, I got to see this piece of evidence is kind of hitting the same thing with uh with this trial
[01:22:47.480 --> 01:22:51.960]   Renee has a great that your sunday editorial at i'more.com everybody should read
[01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:56.040]   Where you compare you say sam song has a long and storied history of this kind of copy
[01:22:56.360 --> 01:22:59.800]   You mentioned the blackjack, which was a copy of the black berry
[01:22:59.800 --> 01:23:03.960]   Uh, you show you show some some real similarities
[01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:09.160]   Here, but I think your point which you've you just made which is that sam song has an opportunity here
[01:23:09.160 --> 01:23:11.720]   To innovate a little bit more
[01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:17.400]   Um, I think i think they'll take it to I mean we saw that with the galaxy s3 is that they're starting to kind of feel their strength
[01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:23.160]   And feel their market position and I think they'll they'll separate themselves rapidly from now that they're i mean their brand is so strong
[01:23:23.240 --> 01:23:25.240]   um one of my one of my one of my
[01:23:25.240 --> 01:23:28.200]   One of the people who writes for us crack berry kevin from crack berry.com
[01:23:28.200 --> 01:23:36.120]   Said that you he has an hdc 1x which I actually prefer to the galaxy s3 and everyone calls it a galaxy s3 because sam song's brand is so strong now
[01:23:36.120 --> 01:23:40.760]   And I think they're they're gonna leverage that to make phones that are I mean they're not gonna need anything
[01:23:40.760 --> 01:23:47.880]   Mapple at all anytime soon. I do I do like the 1x a lot although i carry the s3 all right the straw poll give you a chance
[01:23:47.880 --> 01:23:49.320]   You're the jury
[01:23:49.320 --> 01:23:53.560]   You've you've heard the evidence in fragmentary form go to straw poll
[01:23:53.560 --> 01:23:56.360]   Dot me slash 23 10
[01:23:56.360 --> 01:24:03.640]   And we will check in and see what the juries the unofficial jury says but we still have more trial at least another week
[01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:10.200]   For a sam song to mount its defense. So i'm sure we'll hear lots more interesting stuff meanwhile. Let's talk a little bit about
[01:24:10.200 --> 01:24:12.760]   squarespace.com
[01:24:12.760 --> 01:24:16.600]   I don't think I make this clear i'm gonna make this clear squarespace is web hosting

[01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:36.440]   All right, let's take a look at our straw poll the votes are in
[01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:38.680]   660 total votes
[01:27:38.680 --> 01:27:40.680]   And you know it's closer than I thought it would be
[01:27:40.680 --> 01:27:46.840]   51 percent. Yes, samsung stole from apple and understand it's an imperfect poll because we didn't give you all the possible choices
[01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:53.000]   But my question was if you were on the jury would you give apple the win and the full amount apples asking two and a half billion?
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.640]   51 percent said yes
[01:27:55.640 --> 01:27:57.960]   38 percent said no
[01:27:57.960 --> 01:28:00.520]   11 percent were asleep
[01:28:00.840 --> 01:28:04.120]   Actually, if you add the asleep people to people said no, it's pretty close
[01:28:04.120 --> 01:28:09.240]   Is that one of those adenol sort of things where they're asleep, but they're not aware they're participating in a poll
[01:28:09.240 --> 01:28:16.520]   I've been on a jury the biggest challenge is staying awake
[01:28:16.520 --> 01:28:20.600]   In fact some of the judges don't even do a very good job
[01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:25.960]   It is you know after lunch two in the afternoon
[01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:33.400]   Rounding on and on and on it's not an easy thing and I you know kudos to the jurors in this trial
[01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:37.160]   It's not a huge super long trial, but it's but it's challenging
[01:28:37.160 --> 01:28:39.960]   They've heard some interesting stuff too
[01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:45.000]   Can you imagine any of the three of us being like called for jury duty on that day
[01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:51.000]   And you know you you'll want to answer the questions like when they're interviewing you correctly, but oh bad
[01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:56.440]   I really want to be on this jury what what question what what answer do I give that will not get me thrown
[01:28:56.440 --> 01:28:58.920]   Off yeah, do you say that you use an apple or not?
[01:28:58.920 --> 01:29:03.640]   Do you say what phone you use how do you find someone who doesn't use apple at some point?
[01:29:03.640 --> 01:29:09.000]   It's it's I don't think that they probably try you know the the one jury I was on which is exactly a year ago
[01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:13.240]   Um, I was surprised at the jury selection process. It was nothing like I thought it would be
[01:29:13.240 --> 01:29:16.200]   I thought they'd I first of all they thought as the minute I said
[01:29:16.200 --> 01:29:19.880]   I'm a journalist and they said by the way and there was a tech angle to this
[01:29:19.880 --> 01:29:24.440]   Trial they said will we be hearing about this after the trial on your show and I said yeah
[01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:28.920]   And it still didn't get me. I wasn't trying to get up. I'm just I was surprised
[01:29:28.920 --> 01:29:31.560]   That that wasn't an issue for them
[01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:35.160]   Um, it's not what it's I don't know. You know, I don't it's a
[01:29:35.160 --> 01:29:42.520]   The law is a mysterious mistress. It was between it was between you and another juror who had shoes on his hands
[01:29:42.520 --> 01:29:46.040]   Well, there were some attorney said okay. Let's go with there were some people
[01:29:46.040 --> 01:29:51.720]   I'm sitting there going please don't forgive him. I don't want to sit on a jury with him. Please please please
[01:29:52.760 --> 01:29:59.320]   Okay, I did not want to prejudice our kangaroo court by playing this video
[01:29:59.320 --> 01:30:04.760]   Uh, we've played it on every other show you know what i'm talking about because in fact
[01:30:04.760 --> 01:30:09.960]   I'm going to steal it from uh, i'm more's site after the 30 second ad which will be over in just a little bit
[01:30:09.960 --> 01:30:15.880]   It's amazing. It's amazing. It's mainstream though. I think that's the biggest news to me is that this is actually hit manes kona
[01:30:15.880 --> 01:30:21.320]   No brian. I don't know if kona no brian counts as mainstream, but um, I think his audience is pretty techie
[01:30:22.040 --> 01:30:23.720]   No
[01:30:23.720 --> 01:30:27.480]   It's a young variety of tell me but any but any vision. Yeah, television is more mainstream than us
[01:30:27.480 --> 01:30:30.440]   So here you go kona no brian
[01:30:30.440 --> 01:30:34.520]   Uh on his show last week talking about yes the apple
[01:30:34.520 --> 01:30:41.160]   Samsung law suit and it's good if you can see the video, but those of you listening at home i think you'll understand what's going on apple
[01:30:41.160 --> 01:30:47.320]   Is claiming that samsung copied iphone technology to market its own products
[01:30:47.880 --> 01:30:54.440]   While samsung's vice president of electronics has already released a video that's defending his company
[01:30:54.440 --> 01:30:57.160]   It's a video message defending samsung. Let's take a look
[01:30:57.160 --> 01:31:00.280]   Hello
[01:31:00.280 --> 01:31:05.800]   apples claim that samsung has copied their technology as an allegation we're vigorously denying
[01:31:05.800 --> 01:31:13.080]   Since we entered the personal electronic space samsung has created products that as you can see bear no similarities
[01:31:13.720 --> 01:31:20.280]   Notice the grayer edge of our galaxy phone and what about our galaxy tablets not even close
[01:31:20.280 --> 01:31:29.960]   It's not just electronics samsung's originality is also on display in our home appliance i should i should point out now that he is
[01:31:29.960 --> 01:31:34.600]   That he has changed his outfit to a black turtleneck black jeans
[01:31:34.600 --> 01:31:38.920]   Uh just you know just to give him a unique look
[01:31:39.640 --> 01:31:44.200]   His body is also on display in our home appliances whether it's our new mackerel wave oven
[01:31:44.200 --> 01:31:50.600]   Our vac pro vacuum cleaner or eyewashr with sprawl wheel control
[01:31:50.600 --> 01:31:52.440]   Don't believe me
[01:31:52.440 --> 01:31:57.560]   Then come to our retail stores where you can talk more about our products with a samsung smart guy
[01:31:57.560 --> 01:32:03.960]   And a lot of people ask how does samsung stay so original so innovative
[01:32:03.960 --> 01:32:09.720]   It's very simple really we stay true to the vision of samsung founder staphan jobes
[01:32:09.720 --> 01:32:14.760]   Uh
[01:32:14.760 --> 01:32:19.240]   So you're right i mean i guess that's the moral of this rday is that it is mainstream everybody's aware of this
[01:32:19.240 --> 01:32:27.960]   Yeah, it's i mean there was some pushback saying that they're showing off the app tray for android and not the actual home screen
[01:32:27.960 --> 01:32:33.160]   Those are the images that were marketed for those devices. This is comedy. Come on. Yes, this is comedy
[01:32:33.720 --> 01:32:37.720]   Uh, it does it does illustrate the stakes for both companies. I mean, if samsung it
[01:32:37.720 --> 01:32:40.840]   Apart from the actual court case
[01:32:40.840 --> 01:32:46.680]   There's like public opinion and that samsung could walk away from this with the public opinion that they don't do anything interesting that apple
[01:32:46.680 --> 01:32:50.120]   Hasn't done two years earlier if you want the interesting thing go apple you'll get it earlier
[01:32:50.120 --> 01:32:52.280]   Apple is at risk of saying no
[01:32:52.280 --> 01:32:58.280]   They're not the reason why their their products are better or only because they will sue anybody who does anything that is even remotely
[01:32:58.280 --> 01:33:00.760]   Okay
[01:33:00.760 --> 01:33:05.880]   Any phone that doesn't have a dial a dialing dial on it is going to be sued by apple. Oh
[01:33:05.880 --> 01:33:08.680]   It's a huge risk high stakes on both
[01:33:08.680 --> 01:33:14.040]   Yeah, the great andy hertzfeld who created the the macintosh posted on his uh
[01:33:14.040 --> 01:33:18.040]   He's been posting in fact if you're not following him on google plus you should
[01:33:18.040 --> 01:33:25.080]   Because he's been posting some really interesting stuff on um on his google plus including
[01:33:25.080 --> 01:33:29.240]   A commercial that shiatt day made for apple in 1983
[01:33:29.960 --> 01:33:37.080]   That never aired because apple said it was and i think he means by apple steve jobs that it was too self-congratulatory
[01:33:37.080 --> 01:33:40.120]   And that's not something we associate with
[01:33:40.120 --> 01:33:44.280]   Here's a little bit of that video. This is from andy hertzfeld's blog
[01:33:44.280 --> 01:33:51.320]   Or gplosmackintosh really because we wanted one for ourselves and we could let me let me go full screen on this so we could see the
[01:33:51.320 --> 01:33:59.560]   Yeah, we designed macintosh really because we wanted one for ourselves and we couldn't get one and
[01:33:59.880 --> 01:34:02.920]   Apple turned into a product that's bros miss
[01:34:02.920 --> 01:34:04.520]   What we've got
[01:34:04.520 --> 01:34:09.800]   I think really back as a big you know who we think we are and where we think we're going
[01:34:09.800 --> 01:34:13.640]   And that's why we designed the product and so we said and i heard stelp
[01:34:13.640 --> 01:34:19.640]   Capture the greatness of lisa in something uh affordable to individuals rather than corporations
[01:34:19.640 --> 01:34:26.040]   It had to be used to manufacture a crow it had to be very reliable because we didn't want our customers to ever have to worry about it failing
[01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:30.680]   And it had to cost roughly one quarter as much as anything i'd ever designed before
[01:34:30.680 --> 01:34:35.160]   Demonstrating a macintosh the only way to do it you got to show somebody
[01:34:35.160 --> 01:34:37.320]   I can't really describe it to you in words
[01:34:37.320 --> 01:34:41.560]   But if I can get you to sit in front of it and play with it you won't let go of it
[01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:46.760]   And I think what you're going to see is that the balance of power is going to shift is mic marie
[01:34:46.760 --> 01:34:48.600]   the balance of power from
[01:34:48.600 --> 01:34:50.600]   companies running people
[01:34:50.600 --> 01:34:55.240]   To hopefully people running companies. We were just trying to make something incredibly great
[01:34:56.040 --> 01:35:02.440]   And I think we did uh, I love that smile. He looks like every guy whoever put a quarter next to mine on every
[01:35:02.440 --> 01:35:05.320]   version of the dragons layer i ever played
[01:35:05.320 --> 01:35:09.320]   I love that that was recorded in october 83 of course
[01:35:09.320 --> 01:35:13.240]   Four or five months before uh the macotosh was released
[01:35:13.240 --> 01:35:19.800]   Uh, I guess that's not the commercial but they but the snippets that they were planning on using in a commercial and decided not to
[01:35:20.360 --> 01:35:26.920]   Know is that is that like the 1984 commercial? Did we also not see the completed product in that every day just a motherboard?
[01:35:26.920 --> 01:35:29.640]   It's the only part that we ever saw
[01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:33.000]   Um really really neat
[01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:37.080]   Really really neat and do do take a look at and he's uh
[01:35:37.080 --> 01:35:43.240]   And he hurts felts not any not cause he's got a great google plus too, but i'm talking about any hurts felts google plus
[01:35:43.240 --> 01:35:48.440]   Um, he's at google now. So he's actually very active on on google plus
[01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:53.800]   And apparently uh one last story before we get to your tip of the week
[01:35:53.800 --> 01:35:56.280]   uh apple
[01:35:56.280 --> 01:36:02.920]   Maybe giving us new iMacs and on mac pros. I got an email from somebody or actually was a tweet saying why don't you ever talk about the mac?
[01:36:02.920 --> 01:36:04.920]   And I said don't blame me blame apple
[01:36:04.920 --> 01:36:08.760]   How have you if apple says something we'll do it
[01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:12.760]   You talked about the retina mac you gave it there. I love the retina mac. Here you go
[01:36:12.760 --> 01:36:18.280]   By the way other world computing now has announced solid state upgrades for that
[01:36:19.080 --> 01:36:22.440]   Potentially you know un unrepairable
[01:36:22.440 --> 01:36:26.440]   MacBook retina so if you're even up cruise on if you're brave enough to open
[01:36:26.440 --> 01:36:31.880]   Uh open it you can put and you know, it's just a little I did it on my macbook air was an easy thing to do
[01:36:31.880 --> 01:36:37.480]   I have not used my macbook air or my last year macbook pro since I got the retina one. It just completely replaced both of them
[01:36:37.480 --> 01:36:40.040]   It's replaced my pro. Yeah, it's all I use
[01:36:40.040 --> 01:36:48.200]   Uh internal configuration this from apple insider daniel erin dilger internal configuration files and mountain lion make apparent references
[01:36:48.680 --> 01:36:57.400]   to as yet unreleased new generations of iMac the iMac 13 comma zero and mac pro mac pro six comma zero
[01:36:57.400 --> 01:37:00.280]   both in the context of usb booting options
[01:37:00.280 --> 01:37:02.520]   that
[01:37:02.520 --> 01:37:06.120]   I think daniel perhaps reasonably concludes means there will be no
[01:37:06.120 --> 01:37:10.920]   optical drive in these new devices for the first time
[01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:13.800]   in 20 years
[01:37:13.800 --> 01:37:15.800]   They got floppied they got floppied
[01:37:18.840 --> 01:37:20.840]   I don't know it's it's
[01:37:20.840 --> 01:37:22.920]   It's a rumor so i'm not going to react to a rumor
[01:37:22.920 --> 01:37:25.960]   But you know that that would I think that would be an
[01:37:25.960 --> 01:37:31.400]   Highly interesting move for apple to make to delete an optical drive from a humongous
[01:37:31.400 --> 01:37:33.960]   Desktop that has room it would be it would be a
[01:37:33.960 --> 01:37:39.400]   How does it help right it makes it makes sense for the mac mini because you want that to be as tiny as possible
[01:37:39.400 --> 01:37:44.680]   Also, you don't want another opening to get gathered desk given that so many people use these for servers makes a hell of a sense
[01:37:44.680 --> 01:37:48.440]   Obviously makes obvious sense for the macbook airs. I thought it
[01:37:48.440 --> 01:37:55.000]   Yeah for for an iMac for desktop where you have to tell me why did you delete this?
[01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:59.880]   Well, but remember the first iMac they deleted the floppy and they have a habit of having a
[01:37:59.880 --> 01:38:04.520]   But they had that okay
[01:38:04.520 --> 01:38:07.320]   I don't want to it's a rumor
[01:38:07.320 --> 01:38:09.800]   It makes later if you to carry your whole iMac to starbucks Andy
[01:38:09.800 --> 01:38:12.280]   Yeah
[01:38:12.280 --> 01:38:16.440]   My central thing is always that's fine
[01:38:16.440 --> 01:38:23.080]   I'm not this it's not as though like my my Italian forebears have been hand manufacturing optical drives for generation after generation
[01:38:23.080 --> 01:38:25.800]   You're killing of you're killing a noble tradition apple
[01:38:25.800 --> 01:38:28.840]   It's just it it's just that as a consumer it's like if you're getting
[01:38:28.840 --> 01:38:33.400]   $1,500 for me and you're making me go back to a store to buy something for $100
[01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:36.360]   For this thing that yes, I will probably be not every day
[01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:41.400]   But certainly a few times a year at least you have to explain to me what the win is for me
[01:38:41.720 --> 01:38:46.760]   That you're deleting this no i'm that's that's that's that's a general thing not that I ever use a super drive in my mac pro
[01:38:46.760 --> 01:38:53.240]   New model numbers usually mean there's new processors and my guess would be that they would use whatever the latest intel kit is
[01:38:53.240 --> 01:38:57.640]   Well, there's a couple of things that we need to mac pro we need an update
[01:38:57.640 --> 01:39:04.600]   We've got a we got to put uh, you know thunderbolt in there uh, the and uh frankly ivy bridge wouldn't be so bad
[01:39:04.600 --> 01:39:09.480]   Um, there's you know the new the new z the new zion, uh, is not there
[01:39:10.200 --> 01:39:12.440]   No, uh, it's just it's time
[01:39:12.440 --> 01:39:16.920]   But apparently we according to uh, tim cook we won't see anything till next year. So
[01:39:16.920 --> 01:39:24.360]   That's why i'm using the macbook retina. In fact, i'm real close to buying a thunderbolt display 27 inch display just making my best
[01:39:24.360 --> 01:39:30.840]   I just did i bought this underbolt display hooked it up and it's it's a fantastic combination. Yeah, yeah, and it's faster than your mac pro
[01:39:30.840 --> 01:39:33.960]   It really is i mean it's a it's a beast
[01:39:33.960 --> 01:39:36.600]   Yeah, that's that's why that's why if i'm
[01:39:37.240 --> 01:39:41.560]   I think that we should be really really keen to see what apple decides to do with their desktop machines
[01:39:41.560 --> 01:39:47.720]   Because they could really delete both the iMac and the desktop mac and the and the mac pro and simply say look our machines
[01:39:47.720 --> 01:39:52.280]   Our our notebooks are so good that we would much rather sell you an eight hundred dollars
[01:39:52.280 --> 01:40:00.360]   External screen accessory that lets you keep everything together rather than give you another another power supply another thing that that sucks juice down
[01:40:00.360 --> 01:40:04.200]   Another thing that you have to make room for in your office. It's it's interesting
[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:08.920]   Yeah, absolutely not the not the next real screen would not have a power supply, but no, but no
[01:40:08.920 --> 01:40:14.680]   I think they would they would they would they would be the first to say why are we selling what right?
[01:40:14.680 --> 01:40:17.320]   When why don't we just tell you that our laptops are good enough
[01:40:17.320 --> 01:40:22.440]   You can use them as a desktop and produce a product that is it makes it elegant to use it use an external display
[01:40:22.440 --> 01:40:28.600]   But there was a great comment from Sean Blanc who said that iPads are the new laptop and macbooks are the new desktop
[01:40:28.600 --> 01:40:32.440]   Yeah, just it's just squishing it down. Yeah
[01:40:33.640 --> 01:40:36.600]   We're gonna take break and get our tips picks and all that stuff

[01:41:38.120 --> 01:41:43.960]   This was this is something that I I just picked out yesterday because um, I was uh,
[01:41:43.960 --> 01:41:47.400]   Phil rosenthal is the co-creator of everybody loves raman
[01:41:47.400 --> 01:41:51.560]   And so he has a book called you're lucky you're funny how life becomes a sitcom
[01:41:51.560 --> 01:41:55.800]   Which you probably passed by because oh good a hit show is now
[01:41:56.760 --> 01:42:01.960]   Is now closing up for 10 years and now we're going to see you I accumulated life wisdom about what but you know about after I
[01:42:01.960 --> 01:42:04.600]   Created a family sitcom like okay boring
[01:42:04.600 --> 01:42:08.520]   Uh, but uh phil rosenthal was on uh kevin paulk's chat show
[01:42:08.520 --> 01:42:14.520]   Last week and he is one hell of a funny storyteller who's had an incredible amount of adventures
[01:42:14.520 --> 01:42:19.320]   And also he talks like this hello. He has a wonderful delivery
[01:42:19.320 --> 01:42:22.440]   Like like a younger version of fiveish thing
[01:42:22.440 --> 01:42:25.240]   And he knows what he knows what the punchline is
[01:42:25.800 --> 01:42:27.800]   He knows what the punchline is how to tell it
[01:42:27.800 --> 01:42:35.800]   So when you talking about a person who has been working in the television industry who wrote you remember you remember that video
[01:42:35.800 --> 01:42:39.080]   Where bill clinton the final years the grid einden
[01:42:39.080 --> 01:42:45.640]   He's the one who wrote it. He's the one who shot it and he has a story about how that came with kevin spacey stealing and
[01:42:45.640 --> 01:42:47.880]   Bill's clinton steals his oscar
[01:42:47.880 --> 01:42:49.320]   Yes, yes
[01:42:49.320 --> 01:42:51.480]   So so at minimum track
[01:42:51.560 --> 01:42:57.720]   So I think that you will definitely get this audiobook if you go to the kevin paulk's check show page
[01:42:57.720 --> 01:43:04.280]   And download that episode 10 minutes in you're like audible dot com i can get six or seven hours of this excellent

[01:44:12.440 --> 01:44:15.480]   becomes a sit com
[01:44:16.280 --> 01:44:21.640]   And now it's time for a pic from mr. Renee ritchie of i'mor.com
[01:44:21.640 --> 01:44:25.320]   There's it's not a brand new app
[01:44:25.320 --> 01:44:28.920]   I mean there's a couple of new apps that aren't out yet that i would love to talk about but this one is
[01:44:28.920 --> 01:44:33.560]   It's been around for a while and especially since i've got the retina macbook
[01:44:33.560 --> 01:44:36.840]   And I have things strewn all over other computers that i'm not using right now
[01:44:36.840 --> 01:44:42.280]   It's adovias screens by luke fondal and it's a vnc app
[01:44:42.360 --> 01:44:47.960]   But it's a vnc app that's really ios and mac looking feeling working
[01:44:47.960 --> 01:44:54.600]   It's incredibly fast. It lets you connect from your iphone or your ipad or another mac
[01:44:54.600 --> 01:44:59.880]   It's almost like back to your mac if apple bothered to make it for ios devices as well
[01:44:59.880 --> 01:45:02.600]   And it seems over iCloud. Yes
[01:45:02.600 --> 01:45:10.360]   And it's thinks over iCloud and i've been using it i think over a year i use it constantly and i've had nothing but
[01:45:10.840 --> 01:45:13.320]   Good experiences with it. So I I highly recommend it
[01:45:13.320 --> 01:45:18.920]   You can go to screens app.com or edovia.com screens
[01:45:18.920 --> 01:45:23.720]   And so you need the um the mac version and the ios version is that right?
[01:45:23.720 --> 01:45:29.880]   If you want to use it yet the ios is a universal apps will work on both ipad and iphone if you want the mac version too
[01:45:29.880 --> 01:45:34.200]   Yeah, it's a separate mac store app and he's actually in the mac app store. He's sandboxed
[01:45:34.200 --> 01:45:38.920]   He's doing everything that apple says you should do for next generation mac apps hard to believe
[01:45:39.560 --> 01:45:47.000]   So i'm not sure i understand do i need if i want to use screens on my ipad to access my desktop
[01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.640]   Do i need it on my desktop as well or no no
[01:45:49.640 --> 01:45:54.440]   He has this really good free tool called screens connect
[01:45:54.440 --> 01:46:00.200]   Do you know how like back to my mac is supposed to work but doesn't depending on whether the coffee shop has the wrong kind of router
[01:46:00.200 --> 01:46:01.560]   Does not have the right feature enabled?
[01:46:01.560 --> 01:46:05.080]   Screen is connected is essentially like a dynamic dns system
[01:46:05.400 --> 01:46:10.520]   So that you're the machine you want to connect to will always be telling screen server that oh here's where here's how to find me
[01:46:10.520 --> 01:46:13.720]   Here's how to get through to me and it just works incredibly reliably
[01:46:13.720 --> 01:46:17.000]   I I double this pick because that i've been using screens connect
[01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:24.040]   At least several times a week on my ipad and this is how i fill in the gap between not having a certain mac app on my ipad
[01:46:24.040 --> 01:46:26.200]   And using it as my main going around computer
[01:46:26.200 --> 01:46:30.840]   I actually use back to my mac all the time because it's my home router is set up properly and all that but yeah
[01:46:30.840 --> 01:46:33.000]   It would be nice to have that, you know
[01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:34.520]   Kind of reliably
[01:46:34.520 --> 01:46:38.200]   I have a friend who's a network admin and his dream has always been to sit by the pool
[01:46:38.200 --> 01:46:43.960]   Sippapina colada and run his server room from an ipad and he actually uses screens and and does just that
[01:46:43.960 --> 01:46:46.200]   And that's me is just like the best recommendation awesome
[01:46:46.200 --> 01:46:51.160]   Not only that but is the coolest thing ever like when you're when i'm doing like an installation that's going to take like
[01:46:51.160 --> 01:46:53.240]   Where download is going to take 45 minutes to an hour
[01:46:53.240 --> 01:46:56.680]   And you don't you want to know when it's done so you can go down and like the back rep's over
[01:46:56.680 --> 01:46:58.440]   So now I can actually start working on this thing
[01:46:58.440 --> 01:47:01.640]   I'll have screens on my iphone and just occasionally take it out of my pocket
[01:47:01.640 --> 01:47:04.440]   Just just look at the status bar of that mac to say okay
[01:47:04.440 --> 01:47:09.960]   I should I should I should finish this drink right now get in the car and go home because it looks like it's going to be done in about 10 minutes
[01:47:09.960 --> 01:47:15.800]   Very nice. I've used it in bars on my iphone to do just that to look at my computer at home over 3g
[01:47:15.800 --> 01:47:18.040]   And he's also working on screens 3
[01:47:18.040 --> 01:47:21.960]   I think it's still a little ways away, but this is not one of those apps. It's going to fall by the wayside
[01:47:21.960 --> 01:47:24.680]   He's very good about pushing it forward cool
[01:47:24.680 --> 01:47:27.400]   Good recommendation. Thank you Renee
[01:47:28.200 --> 01:47:29.720]   Andy and ico
[01:47:29.720 --> 01:47:32.760]   I don't know. Did you prepare a lion tip? Do you want to do that first in that recommendation?
[01:47:32.760 --> 01:47:37.320]   I have a lion tip if you need to get right to the pick. I can go to the pick but i'm going to go to the pick
[01:47:37.320 --> 01:47:42.040]   Go to the pick. Okay, we'll save the lion for next week. Well, always good to have a different next week
[01:47:42.040 --> 01:47:45.560]   Um, this is a very simple device that i've been looking for for quite a while
[01:47:45.560 --> 01:47:49.080]   It's from belkin. It's the belkin car audio connect ox
[01:47:49.080 --> 01:47:50.920]   awful awful product name
[01:47:50.920 --> 01:47:55.640]   But what it is is it's for people like me who all I want to i'm not an audio file
[01:47:55.640 --> 01:48:00.520]   I'm also not a car guy. So i'm not willing to spend 200 dollars to have a bluetooth
[01:48:00.520 --> 01:48:05.800]   Audio deck put into my car just so i connect with wirelessly. So this is the nicest bluetooth
[01:48:05.800 --> 01:48:08.600]   Bluetooth kit i've seen
[01:48:08.600 --> 01:48:13.720]   On this end, it's just your basic, you know, cigarette ladder connector with built-in usb power
[01:48:13.720 --> 01:48:19.400]   You got this plug jack that plugs into whatever audio in you have on your existing car deck
[01:48:19.400 --> 01:48:24.520]   And then this is simply a bluetooth transceiver that magnetically sticks onto your dashboard
[01:48:24.600 --> 01:48:27.320]   So if you want to hide this or take it out of your car like i've dust done
[01:48:27.320 --> 01:48:29.880]   You can just simply yank it out without any harm done
[01:48:29.880 --> 01:48:33.400]   And so when you get into your car, you just simply tap this button
[01:48:33.400 --> 01:48:39.400]   It turns on the bluetooth your phone automatically connects to it and now you've got bluetooth audio. Oh, i'm sorry this uh, uh
[01:48:39.400 --> 01:48:42.920]   Uh, you got bluetooth audio and you've got the the audio feed going
[01:48:42.920 --> 01:48:45.640]   It's also a bluetooth microphone hands-free
[01:48:45.640 --> 01:48:49.720]   So anytime you want to answer a call you can simply reach to the dashboard touch this button again
[01:48:49.720 --> 01:48:53.960]   And you'll be using this as a bluetooth microphone with the audio going through your car stereo
[01:48:54.280 --> 01:48:57.080]   So again for someone who didn't want to it's it's an old car
[01:48:57.080 --> 01:48:59.000]   I'm probably going to be buying a new one in a year or two anyway
[01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:02.760]   So who you know i don't that's not worth taking my dash apart to put in a new stereo
[01:49:02.760 --> 01:49:07.960]   But this gives me like the bluetooth audio that i've really really wanted and you can get it for less than 50 bucks
[01:49:07.960 --> 01:49:13.560]   Works great on belkin. That's 80 dollars, but uh amazon and others probably have better deals. Yeah
[01:49:13.560 --> 01:49:16.280]   I use it too. It's fantastic. So this
[01:49:16.280 --> 01:49:18.520]   So this
[01:49:18.520 --> 01:49:21.960]   Does it use a 2dp to connect? Yeah, okay, right?
[01:49:22.520 --> 01:49:26.280]   Uh any any like bluetooth three even bluetooth three profile
[01:49:26.280 --> 01:49:29.640]   Uh work just fine with it. So it acts not only as a stereo
[01:49:29.640 --> 01:49:31.720]   a stereo
[01:49:31.720 --> 01:49:36.120]   Transponder but also will you act as a hands-free device your phone will will respect
[01:49:36.120 --> 01:49:42.360]   Will use it as identify and use it as both of those things, but you do need a ox into your car stereo
[01:49:42.360 --> 01:49:47.160]   Yeah, this is this is the end that plugs into whatever you've got inside your car
[01:49:47.160 --> 01:49:50.440]   So if you don't have one of those yet, you're going to have to get one of those
[01:49:50.440 --> 01:49:55.480]   But if you have if you have again if you if you got like an ancient beater car with just a cassette deck
[01:49:55.480 --> 01:49:58.760]   You can have the cassette adapter use a gender change here to plug this in
[01:49:58.760 --> 01:50:03.240]   Fortunately, my car is not so old that I don't have a way to put like ox input to it
[01:50:03.240 --> 01:50:05.480]   It just didn't have bluetooth and i'm like, uh god
[01:50:05.480 --> 01:50:08.440]   That's at the middle range
[01:50:08.440 --> 01:50:12.840]   It was like do it do it do I want bluetooth in my car or do I want the brakes to work again?
[01:50:12.840 --> 01:50:19.000]   Maybe i should get the fix the really great thing too is if you have friends family significant others who happen not to use apple gear
[01:50:19.080 --> 01:50:21.240]   bluetooth is absolutely platform agnostic
