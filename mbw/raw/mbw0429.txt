[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.360]   Scribe? Scribe? No, no, I'm a member of the slow news movement.
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.320]   Like this is like a Ken Burns documentary. It takes years to want to use to preserve
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.760]   the pair unfold over a series of weeks. But by the time the iPhone 7 comes out you will realize
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.840]   that the iPhone 6 which is no longer being sold is in fact very much worth your time.
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.240]   Also here Mr. Larry from iMore.com.
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:28.400]   Oh he's silent. You did. I apologize I was watching the watch kit video while
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.320]   I was. Oh good we gave you a little extra time to watch that we'll talk about that in a second.
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:40.240]   I Renee. I actually have a lot of questions for Renee. Including the 10.1 10.10.1.
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:48.080]   Yeah and 8.1.1.1. Holy cow. All the point ones Leo. All the point ones.
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:55.200]   And from Washington DC Miss or is it Pittsburgh PA? I never know. It's Pittsburgh PA. That's
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:01.200]   because he's out of 50% gray. Alex Lindsey of the pixel core. Where it's 14 degrees here but it
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:08.800]   feels like negative one. I'm competing now with Renee on on chilliness. I went out this morning I
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.840]   had taken my kids to the bus and I went out and figured oh I'll just go out with my you know just
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.840]   with my button up shirt on you know no big deal. Yeah I almost I think I almost died.
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.800]   You know when it gets to a certain temperature my temperature is 5 degrees.
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:29.920]   Your tongue starts to hurt. You have to keep your mouth closed. It's when my ears start ringing.
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.480]   You know it's like this thing that happens in my ears when it gets pretty cold. When it's -40
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.280]   here Celsius you go outside and your face just hurts and you can feel the liquid freezing in your
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:45.520]   head. Yeah that's okay. You win. Okay okay fine. The good thing is when a pig wins but we're
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:51.200]   well well Renee Renee I don't want to brag but here in New England we know enough to stay inside
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:58.560]   when it's money. No that's how manly the Quebecois are they just go out. They don't care if their face
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:06.000]   hurts. Minus 40 it doesn't matter whether it's Celsius or Fahrenheit. Yeah I haven't experienced
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.520]   minus 40 because one's money minus 40 whenever I am I just stay in the yeah building. You're an
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.080]   anti-year. Guess what I'm not getting my teeth clean today you can charge me for the session.
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:23.520]   Hey Sam Downey's here too. We'll talk I'm glad you're back. We'll talk to Sam a little later on the
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:30.800]   show about that. Is it National Epilepsy Week Day, month, year, month, pick a timeframe.
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:39.200]   Well there's lots to say but as we go to press - Andy will know what that means - as we go to press
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:46.560]   Apple has pushed out a watch kit SDK and video and Mr Renee Richie has been listening as you see
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:54.400]   or watching the video. Get your iPhone - this is at the developer site developer.apple.com/watchkit.
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:06.080]   Get your iPhone app ready for Apple Watch. This is good news. Tell us Renee what we've had so far
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:12.400]   and what's new in this release. So all we've had so far is the event the Apple iWatch event where
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:18.640]   Tim Cook got up on stage to introduce the iWatch and Kevin Lynch gave us a basic idea of what it does
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:23.040]   and they promised us we'd be getting an SDK, a software development kit for developers
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:30.640]   around November. So now it's November and the watch kit SDK is out along with Xcode 6.2 and iOS 8.2 SDK
[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:36.800]   because the iWatch sorry the Apple Watch right now is dependent on the iPhone. So the way it's
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:41.440]   going to work it looks like is you deliver your app to the iPhone and that pushes interface to
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:46.480]   the Apple Watch and developers can make full interfaces which are full apps they can make
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:51.120]   glances which are like widgets and they can make actionable notifications which is sort of like a
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.600]   little alert comes in and you can do something with it. That's pretty much exactly what they
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:00.000]   promised us that they would be delivering. There's a couple interesting things in there like it
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.520]   looks like the two watch sizes are actually different resolutions the 38 versus 42 millimeter the 42
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:10.640]   millimeter actually has more pixels which plays into sort of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 plus having
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:15.360]   more pixels so they're not just blowing it up it's not going to be more blurry or less sharp it's
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:21.920]   going to just have more real estate a little bit more real estate for you. Those larger sizes are
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:26.800]   available in all three models or no? Yes there's aluminum stainless steel and gold and you can get
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:32.560]   38 and 42 millimeter in both. So that's good that means that is kind of like the 6 and 6 plus of
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:37.840]   watches. It sounds complicated at first but when you think about it you choose the size the same way
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:42.880]   you choose a 6 or a 6 plus then you choose the finish whether you want aluminum stainless steel
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:48.960]   or gold. Whether your wallet can afford then what if you won the wallet? Yes they started at 350
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:55.120]   for aluminum so we know it's going to be a hefty price tag. Gold is real gold so it's going to go
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:59.280]   up but then you choose your strap the same way you pick a case for a phone so like the same way you
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.000]   pick a blue or a red or a black case. That could have been included in the price. It's a simple.
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:08.160]   I believe it'll come with a strap. The more expensive straps will probably be more expensive.
[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:12.880]   They'll probably be a base strap that comes with the watch material that you choose whether it's
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:19.040]   sport or the regular or the edition version. If you watch the video it sounds to me there's no
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:24.160]   official confirmation. It sounds to me like it's Jake Barron's voice. He's the frameworks evangelist
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:30.640]   at Apple. That's what this is. This is an SDK but they're really saying it's a framework.
[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:35.680]   What is the difference? Yeah it's the same as when the original. So the
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:40.080]   frame the SDK is just the kit. It's the collection of frameworks that developers can use to target
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:44.880]   the Apple Watch and the frameworks are a bunch of different classes and sample code and a whole
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:50.000]   bunch of other things that developers can use to easily make apps. It's just one of the strengths
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.400]   of iOS in general is the quality of what they call the Coco Touch framework. Similar to the
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:58.560]   Coco frameworks on the Mac and those are the things that developers target and then those
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:02.240]   frameworks go into a lot of heavy lifting for them. It means they don't have to write all the base
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:06.400]   code to do all the base functionality themselves. Apples pre-created a bunch of it for them.
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:11.680]   When I hear framework I think of Ruby on Rails which you know you type a couple of commands and it
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:17.200]   would build kind of a base application to which you would then add your unique functionality.
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:21.840]   Is it the same here? Sure like UIKit. UIKit is a framework that lets you create the basic
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:26.480]   skeleton of an application on iOS like the navigation bar and the buttons and all those things.
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:30.480]   And there's all sorts of frameworks. There's graphics, core graphics and metal is a framework
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:35.360]   that lets you target low-end GPU stuff. So all of those things are just a collection of code and
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:41.520]   utilities and I'm not a developer so I can't explain it perfectly but it abstracts your job as a
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:44.720]   developer and makes it much easier for you to target the things Apple wants you to target.
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:51.520]   This reminds me a little of the Apple of the Android Wear architecture. I know when you have an
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:58.640]   Android Wear app on your smartphone, on your Android phone it will automatically propagate
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:03.840]   to your watch without any intervention on your part. And then I've seen at least one app, Evernote,
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:09.360]   where if you want Android Wear capability there's a part you have to download that doesn't show up
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:15.360]   anywhere on the phone but once you download and install it now you have Evernote as a note-taking
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:20.960]   app on Android Wear. So it sounds like a similar kind of system I'm sure that you know once you
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:25.520]   start using it it's very very different. It says... And is my understanding that the UI is stored
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:30.960]   in the watch app itself? Yeah so the UI... It's my understanding that earlier this year Apple once
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:34.560]   again refactored springboard which is the app launching mechanism and they broke it up into
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:41.520]   something called Frontboard and there's various other ones as well like pre-board and sorry
[00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:45.840]   there's several of them now not just one big monolithic structure and I believe Frontboard might
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:49.920]   be what's running on the watch and that would basically handle all the interface. Well the
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:53.840]   rest of the stuff stayed on the phone. So it sounds like the full-in architecture. UI is stored in
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:10:03.360]   watch app, plan your UI in advance and then code updates UI from the iPhone. Yeah. All right so...
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:07.600]   So again all the power is in your iPhone the connectivity is in your iPhone this is very much
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:12.480]   the shuttlecraft to the spaceship. And yet the watch will itself store enough code so that it
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:18.560]   knows it draws the basic UI and then you fill it up from the iPhone. That's what gives you the local
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:24.000]   performance. That's the actual application move quickly on the phone. Of course. Of course it's around
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:30.880]   the watch. Well this is all on schedule. This is when they said they would push it out.
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:36.960]   And if you... I apologize I'm not specific but it released it literally 15 minutes before we just
[00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:43.840]   came out. And we'll learn more as time goes by. I think what's kind of interesting is
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:52.080]   and I'm not sure what the time frame is but if you release it in November now developers have it
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:57.360]   I guess they've done some early work without it knowing at least the outlines of it but now
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:02.960]   they've actually got it they can start working and I would say you know development testing and
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:08.480]   releases at least a three or four month cycle. Yes? Yeah. Yeah well the rumor has it that it will
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:11.920]   come out in spring which means March or April so they have quite a bit of time to get ready for.
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:17.360]   They have just the right amount. Four months. Yeah. And so the release of this in November kind
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:23.360]   of confirms that. Here's some a look at some of the UI elements if you show this Jason this is
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:28.560]   kind of interesting. So you have switches, you have text controls. These are some of the
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:36.640]   controls. You have a plus and minus slider. You have date. You can display images. That's cool.
[00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:43.040]   If you watch this video you'll get a much clearer sense of what the watch could look like or what
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:47.440]   apps on the watch could look like. It looks a lot like extensibility. Like I wouldn't be surprised
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:51.040]   it was built off a lot of the same stuff that extensibility was built off of like today
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:55.040]   today if you widgets become glances and the interactive notifications are similar they just
[00:11:55.040 --> 00:12:00.880]   project to the phone instead of sorry to the watch instead of the phone. Right. Interesting. Alex
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:05.440]   you think you'll be doing I know I know you have a cadre of developers over there at Pixelcore you
[00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:10.960]   think you could be doing any Apple Watch stuff. Absolutely. You know we we we really look at
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:17.280]   wearables and whether it's especially with the question engine stuff that we do with Hazeu. I
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:24.000]   think that we're gonna definitely look at that as ways to actually take questions and and Q
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.880]   you know moderators Q folks I mean I think having something handheld makes a lot of sense. So as an
[00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:32.400]   as a way to integrate into some of our events I think that we're going to use it. We also see a
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:36.960]   lot of opportunities in ways to organize production crews and stuff like that. So from a production
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:42.080]   perspective I think there's a lot of opportunities in building stuff that is always on you it's not
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:45.520]   conflicting with your phones you're getting that information while you possibly might be on your
[00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:50.560]   phone as well. So those are all things that we're really excited about. Yeah. I have to say now
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:55.040]   that I've used Android Wear for a little while I am a little bit more come around on the idea of
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:13:01.040]   the utility of a watch. There are absolutely some things that having a little small second screen
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:07.280]   that's readily available. And I think the thing that you have to look at is how do you integrate
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:11.680]   your watch with your glass with your phone with your computer. See that that's really the
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:18.000]   right. Sorry. All right. Well and as Renee pointed out this is in a way this is a form of
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:24.320]   continuity and I wouldn't be surprised at all if the framers were related. It's clearly Apple's
[00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:30.880]   vision that you'll have multiple Apple devices a watch a phone a tablet and a computer and that
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:34.480]   they all will be able to hand off one to the other in a kind of seamless fashion.
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:39.280]   Well and I think that what's partially interested is having them hand off to one to one another but
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:44.640]   what's also very interesting is the idea of them actually working in unison. So there you know you're
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:48.720]   getting different information on different pieces around whatever you're working on. Yeah.
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:57.440]   What do you think Andy? I'm trying to catch up. My head has been down on the screen.
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:02.240]   You're all watching this video kind of as we talk. Yeah. It really is. I think that
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:08.480]   the most important step in the development of Apple Watch is still going to be Apple's launch
[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:14.880]   day keynote where they say okay I know that we were being kind of speculative back in
[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:19.600]   back in September but now we're shipping it and here is exactly what here's our complete vision of
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:23.840]   what using this watch is going to be. Here's our vision of what was going to be appropriate
[00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:28.800]   for a watch where what's not going to be appropriate for watch where and I feel as though the first
[00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:32.800]   year there's going to be some growing pains as remember how well the first time that for the first
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:38.320]   year of Mac OS when developers had to figure out who've been training themselves for years and
[00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:44.720]   years and years to do text interfaces had to sort of translate at the beginning these text
[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:49.200]   interfaces to a drop down menu and window structure that really didn't work because they were still
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:54.160]   thinking in terms of text they weren't thinking originally in terms of a graphical use interface
[00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:58.320]   so I think there's going to be growing pains for the first year as people start
[00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:04.320]   writing scaled down watch excuse me stop writing scaled down phone apps and start writing apps
[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:10.720]   that are specifically and elegantly and gloriously targeted for a watch. I mean I'm also you know this
[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:15.040]   this Android Wear watch has not been a harvest. Are you still wearing that? Yeah for I've been
[00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:19.360]   wearing it like every day for about two months now. Yeah I mean and it really is really difficult for
[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:26.800]   me to not have it especially on a travel day or on a really busy day and I think that I think what
[00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:31.920]   Android Wear does really well is that it doesn't try to use their tasks that are more appropriate
[00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:36.720]   for a bigger screen it just tries to help you keep your phone in your pocket and not have to
[00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:41.680]   take it out and unlock it for things that are really silly and trivial. I would love to say so
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:49.840]   although my as a two month old Android Wear user it's a little bit alarming to see so many user
[00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:55.520]   interface elements and controls capable on an Apple watch. On the other hand I'm aware that
[00:15:55.520 --> 00:16:01.760]   although I love this this Moto 360 and I use it several times every single day I'm almost never
[00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:06.560]   using an app on the watch it really is there to control and interact with stuff that I've got on
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:13.360]   my phone. I'm intrigued by the idea of what Apple would present as a uniquely watch based app
[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:19.360]   because right now I've kind of my imagination is a little bit limited because whenever I really do
[00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:22.480]   just like try to sit back and think about if I were a developer and I wanted to write something
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:27.600]   that was not just simply there to get notifications from a phone but to actually be an app that lives
[00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:32.640]   on a watch what would I do and anything I come up with I'm thinking no that's a situation which
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:36.400]   the user would probably be much happier just taking out their phone so I'm really curious I'm really
[00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:41.280]   keen to see what ideas other people are going to have. You know I think of it like this this is you
[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:46.960]   you've all and I'm sure as you walk around Boston you see the on the telephone pole
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:52.720]   the you know and then tear off the thing to get my number I feel like this is this is like you know
[00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:57.760]   apartment for rent or cat lost and then you say take take take a thing take a tab and then you take
[00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:01.920]   that with you. I feel like the watch is like the little tab that there that there's a logical
[00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:07.040]   relationship watch app shouldn't stand agree with you shouldn't stand alone you don't have enough
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:10.960]   real estate to do that. Yeah that was that was the thing that concerned me about the what they
[00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:14.960]   showed off in September that you're showing me how look at look at how much time you're going to
[00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:20.400]   spend actually doing this tiny little target yeah and that's like they showed lots of features that
[00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:25.440]   okay but if I'm going to be sending a text message and attaching a photo to it my phone is in my
[00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:30.240]   pocket I'm unless I'm holding groceries I've got the ability to take my phone out of my pocket so I
[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:34.480]   think that even Apple I believe that even Apple is trying to navigate their way around this problem
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:40.320]   of how do we define a watch app that is unique and distinct from a phone app just as a phone app
[00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:44.880]   is unique and distinct from a desktop app. Do you think that Apple will learn from Android
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:48.560]   where do you think they have things to learn from Android? No I'm absolutely certain I'm absolutely
[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:53.360]   certain of it I know that there are folks inside Apple that are Android where users partly because
[00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:57.920]   they like it and partly because it's very informative there are things that you can only there are
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:01.920]   things that you can learn again sitting in yourself and leaning back and you know using these
[00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:05.600]   doing these good ocken experiments but then there are times where you really need to hold a real
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:10.160]   thing in your hand or have it on your wrist and not not in terms of oh that works let's copy that
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:16.000]   but wearing this every single day and realizing here is what bugs the hell out of me with this watch
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.840]   and I definitely we definitely don't want to make those mistakes again or here's I've just
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:24.480]   downloaded 20 different apps for this Android where watch there are four of them that I really
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:28.560]   like there are eight of them that have really screwed up let's not make those mistakes again too
[00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:34.080]   remember that when they during the the expanded stuff that Apple was talking about when they
[00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:38.640]   launched the iPhone one of the things they're talking about is that how we carry inside Apple
[00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:42.960]   we carry around blackberries every single day we carry around palms we carry around windows
[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:49.840]   phone devices and a lot of the with a lot of what resulted in these elegance of the iPhone was a
[00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:53.520]   reaction to things they did not like about the phones that they were wearing and using every
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:56.880]   single day I was very skeptical as you remember about a watch until I
[00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:02.320]   wore this started wearing this Moto 360 every day yeah one of the things I'll tell you a couple
[00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:07.280]   of things I've learned and you can anybody who wants to pitch into on this a couple of things I've
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:12.640]   learned like you Andy you know that these should be an extension of an app that's running on the phone
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:18.960]   but also it has to look good you know I had the Samsung Android where it looks just that looks bad
[00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:24.720]   and so I mean design Apple's right design is important but by the way this simple Moto 360
[00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:29.600]   design is sufficient I don't feel embarrassed to wear it you know this is not something that I
[00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:34.560]   if this is not something I would have guessed had I not been wearing this like in the flash every
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:39.440]   single day I think that this is just a brilliant brilliant design and part of it is that there's
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:46.080]   almost no presence facing the user except for this screen the bezel is tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny
[00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:49.680]   there's only one little control on the side here so that really all your look it's very
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:54.080]   iPhone like it that the only thing you're actually looking at is the interface that's digital you're
[00:19:54.080 --> 00:20:00.240]   not looking at physical stuff and you're right that the making of this round is also a brilliant idea
[00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:05.760]   not only because it really does echo the concept of a watch but also I've I like yourself I was
[00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:11.360]   wearing one of the the early LG and one of the early Samsung watches and they're not only
[00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:16.160]   they're big but they're square and those squares get caught up on sleeves and stuff like this
[00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:20.080]   whereas this you've got a really good chance of being able to actually put on a shirt without
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:25.680]   having to unbutton something first so I mean there was a Apple may have successfully squared
[00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:32.160]   the circle with this because while it is a square it feels fairly soft and appealing and also the
[00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:37.760]   smaller size one is very very in line with what anybody would put on their wrist so that's not a
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:43.120]   problem I just I just have to though point out that the right after the Apple watch came out there's
[00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:49.840]   some I will I will there I don't know if this is a fanboy blog post but it was fanboy-ish saying
[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:54.880]   that well here's why you make a watch this is why you make a watch square you don't make it round
[00:20:54.880 --> 00:21:00.560]   and they decided to take the screenshots that Apple provided of the uh Apple watch interface and
[00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:04.480]   just trace a circle around it you see oh look how all the stuff that's cut off from the corners of
[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:09.920]   that though see how silly it is to make a round digital watch like this and saying yeah num nuts
[00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:15.200]   the you that that's what happens when you like take a take a phone and put it on top of a computer
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:20.640]   display and see how much gets cut off terrible you just made the case that you can't you can't
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:25.040]   design things for phones right it's actually built very very well for that round display if anything
[00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:30.320]   I think that it promotes a certain amount of restraint in user interface design saying you only
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:34.880]   have a certain amount of real estate here and a certain amount of the user's attention you can't
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:38.640]   squander it by saying you know what I think I will rather than think for a week on how to best
[00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:41.840]   implement this we'll just put a volume control here and we'll put all brightness control here
[00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:47.840]   and we'll put another thing there so yeah it's not it's not really Apple not not fascinating time
[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:52.800]   not merely Apple that's going to learn from this but people who make apps are probably learning
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:58.240]   right now with Android Wear and I I think Apple we we kind of always surmise this but Apple's
[00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:01.920]   got to benefit by being late to the game by having the benefit of this
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:10.480]   yeah right yeah Apple never is the first of anything right not the first one not the first
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:16.880]   tablet not the first watch yeah and they they almost always come in you know at there there are
[00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:21.680]   fashionably late yes you know they don't they don't come in super late behind everybody else but
[00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:24.880]   they kind of come in and when they come in they make some key improvements looking at what everyone
[00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:28.800]   else was doing and they go okay well we're gonna shift you generally we're gonna cut a bunch of
[00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:34.560]   things out we're gonna make it more efficient or easier to use or we're gonna integrate it more
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:38.000]   with the hardware and software and that's usually kind of how they they add their value to it
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:43.360]   I think what you said I'm excited I'm all of a sudden I'm excited about the Apple watch
[00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:47.920]   I think what you said earlier was really apt that it really is about continuity and
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:52.000]   seamlessness and convenience and I think you know Apple didn't come out and say it at the event
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:57.040]   but I think everything that they said plays towards this being convenience that as phones get bigger
[00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:00.240]   you can leave that in your purse you can leave that in your pocket you you'll have the watch
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:03.920]   you don't have to worry about it being you know available to you all the time and then as phones
[00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:07.280]   get bigger tablets can get bigger too you have a bigger tablet don't worry about it you don't
[00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:11.600]   have to fish it out all the time you have it on your watch and I think this is much as bigger phones
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:16.240]   will allow bigger tablets to be a thing I think the the bigger phones will let the watch be a
[00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:20.880]   things all gonna yeah hopefully it'll all be a virtuous cycle well this that's important thing
[00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:25.840]   uh work with an iPad the same way it works with an iPhone do you have to have an iPhone for this
[00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:32.320]   we don't know yet oh I I understand is that my understanding is that it's going to be
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:36.560]   it's going to require an iPhone okay but that but that's that's that's a really good point
[00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:41.680]   Renee partly because we don't realize that uh you know women have problems with larger phones
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:46.160]   both it's difficult to manage them it's difficult to find places to they don't they don't have
[00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:51.360]   large enough pockets they're also worried about holding on the subway or in a public place it's
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:56.000]   really expensive thing that makes them a very flashy target so a smaller watch actually lets
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:03.280]   them have this sort of functionality without having to deal with all the the the the difficulty
[00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:08.160]   that a six inch or five point five inch screen uh brings with it and as Ryan s points out in our
[00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:15.600]   chat room uh iOS developers are probably some of the best UI developers in the in the world I
[00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:21.680]   would say absolutely are and uh so if and I think they're probably thrilled to be getting this
[00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:27.280]   watch kit now and beginning to work and I bet you some do stand alone watch apps and and maybe
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:32.800]   you they'll be phenomenal because these yeah developers are so good uh and uh anybody who's
[00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:37.520]   developing you know I have to think somebody like Marco Armit is just rubbing his hands with Lord
[00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:43.040]   britter the icon factor yeah they're just going yeah this is gonna go on and on yeah in fact I
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:47.920]   bet you anything that they're not watching today because they're looking at that this video
[00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:55.520]   and and uh they're head down in Xcode right now yeah like every other apple release this is
[00:24:55.520 --> 00:25:01.600]   gonna be you know the the there's a first mover status that does generally uh translate into a
[00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:05.280]   lot of revenue because you're gonna now have a whole bunch of people that buy their watch and
[00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:08.560]   they're just gonna want to buy a bunch of things that are relatively cool that they can kind of
[00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:11.440]   figure out how to do it I don't know how many people are gonna make a whole bunch of watch apps
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:15.680]   most likely that like like literally just other time piece you know looks for a dollar and that's
[00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:19.040]   one of the things that I don't like on a land where is the watch faces because there's a huge
[00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:24.640]   marketplace of watch faces now yeah and I'd be surprised if Omega and and Rolex and at all did
[00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:28.240]   not simply we're we know the people gonna be trying to copy our watch faces so we're gonna beat
[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:32.080]   them to it we're gonna charge just a dollar for them knowing that the people who are
[00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:35.840]   the people who can afford a dollar for a Rolex watch face are probably not in the market for a
[00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:42.480]   $6,000 watch but but it's but it's but it's good brand recognition um the what I wanted I don't
[00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:47.600]   know if I can if I can bring it up uh while I'm talking about there's interface design is a really
[00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:54.080]   cool thing too like you talk about the very few really good like uh and uh watch based apps this
[00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:59.680]   is a tip calculator which I love because they decided to figure out a way to like input numbers
[00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:03.520]   in a really cool way you just move that slider around there's just you just you just you just
[00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:08.000]   roll this around and I can't I can't do this backwards yeah but so you just move that around to
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:13.680]   it's more Fred Astaire than Ginger Rogers later yeah exactly so you just spin this you spin this
[00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:18.800]   around to to set the the bill of money then you tap this button to set what percentage of the
[00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:23.760]   of the the bill you want for tips and it's just beautiful and it's elegant and sort of thing
[00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:28.240]   where you actually have fun calculating a tip and splitting a bill five or six ways and this is not
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:32.800]   an interface that I would have ever have thought of uh when I when we first saw when we first saw
[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:37.520]   that first video uh that Motorola posted uh with that little awkward like two people seated in
[00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:41.200]   chairs talking about this big round watch I would never have figured out that wow that's
[00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:45.200]   actually a very pretty interface but I'm very surprised so that's that's why I say this is such
[00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:49.520]   an exciting time uh to be really into tech and to enjoy these things because we're seeing
[00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:55.840]   companies worth you know billions and billions of dollars and people who will be have to have to
[00:26:55.840 --> 00:27:00.480]   we have to scrape and save to a four to three hundred fifty dollar watch all on the same page
[00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:04.960]   not knowing exactly what this how this technology should work but everybody's trying to figure it
[00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:08.560]   out all together this is such a cool time the only thing that makes me sad is I'm gonna have to
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:14.480]   carry an iPhone and I've become really attached to my hand right I know I know it's like a party
[00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:19.200]   more than one phone you know you know it's people keep people keep people keep asking me like especially
[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:23.680]   now that now that you now that there's the iPhone 6 in 6 plus now that they've added these improvements
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:29.200]   to iOS like are you switching back to iPhone and like a few months ago I would have said oh almost
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:34.880]   likely yes but now it's like I like this so much that I'm gonna wait to see what the Apple watch is
[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:39.680]   like before I make a decision that's an interest you're choosing your phone based on your watch
[00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:46.880]   well no I got clever this is clever it's like it's it's also a testament to how close iOS and
[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:52.160]   Android L are in functionality I agree they're they're still very different they're not the same
[00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:56.960]   operating system they have different strengths and weaknesses but on a point scale I think that
[00:27:56.960 --> 00:28:05.760]   iOS 8 is an a minus 93 and Android L so far my experience is that it's like a a minus 90 or 91
[00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:10.880]   it's close enough that's so close if you can if there's one accessory you really really like
[00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:15.840]   you might stick with Android only because you like this one accessory that's not compatible with
[00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:20.080]   iOS and the same the inverse would be true of the Apple watch if it works out really well that
[00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:26.240]   I would easily leap from Android to iOS if I start testing out Apple watch apps and oh my god
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:30.080]   they've they're not they're not satisfied with the Android Wear proposition of just making an
[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:35.600]   extension of your phone they really want to make this a really good comprehensive destination apps
[00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:42.720]   that make sense for a watch okay goodbye iPhone 7 thank you I am watching this this watch kit video
[00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:47.120]   and I think this is one thing that could be a differentiator there's they're showing right now
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:53.520]   building a watch app and they're showing an American Airlines app and if this is one example
[00:28:53.520 --> 00:29:00.160]   of and what I think is really happening is this didn't okay let me let me step back this didn't
[00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:05.280]   happen in the PC world you know people who chose a Mac I think we all did over over Windows
[00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:14.640]   there it was not a question of a - 93 versus a - 91 there was a very big difference and in some cases
[00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:19.040]   you made some sacrifices because maybe the apps you wanted weren't available on the Macintosh but
[00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:26.400]   there was a palpable difference now we're in a world where you choose the thing that matters to
[00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:31.840]   you most if it's camera you might choose an iPhone if it's you know you like one accessory versus
[00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:36.560]   the other you might choose that one and that's I think that's a very interesting world where
[00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:42.000]   now what you have to do as a buyer as a user is think about well what matters most to me
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:49.120]   this this American Airlines app could be if you're a frequent flyer how well the watch handles travel
[00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:56.960]   boarding getting a plane being you know getting reminded leave the bar now or have another drink
[00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:02.000]   those things could be the differentiator we're in a world where tiny differences are going to make
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.400]   a big difference in your choice another one too I think though Leo I mean well first you to Andy's
[00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:09.760]   other point you guys you don't need a day or a night watch now you just need a left and a right
[00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:14.240]   watch left and a right phone but when an each pocket one on each side you're fine really don't
[00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:19.520]   want to carry two phones but I may be the Harvey debt system technology but we'll take that please
[00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:23.440]   I think the big one of the issues here this is what's interesting is I think why you're seeing
[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:28.160]   things like continuity and why you're seeing android everywhere and things like material design
[00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:31.680]   that they once they get you in they want to make sure the best experiences if you have
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:36.320]   everything across their system so if you have a Mac and an iOS device and a watch it's a better
[00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:40.560]   experience and you're more likely to get the other device in that family and if you have android
[00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:44.160]   where and you have android in the car and you have android TV you're more likely to get the next
[00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:48.400]   android device and I think that is you know even though they're so close I think as you start getting
[00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:52.880]   more and more involved in each ecosystem the divide becomes bigger just for you personally well now
[00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:57.040]   we're getting synchronous with this video because look what it says advanced tips use the hand off
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:02.160]   API just as we suppose at the beginning before we'd seen this whole thing this is really a part
[00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:08.080]   of continuity and it's exactly as you said it's part of buying into an ecosystem that's across the
[00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:14.800]   board um nine and five Mac is saying that uh and maybe it'll appear later in this video that apple
[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:19.360]   saying if you want to stand alone watch app you're gonna have to wait till later this year that watch
[00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:25.680]   apps that ship initially will all have to come be tethered to and come from an iPhone that's correct
[00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:29.200]   that they said that earlier though they announced that previously so that's what's coming next year
[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:34.560]   some people think in the in the spring some people think at WWDC 2015 yeah and apple apple never
[00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:39.280]   has any problems uh they never have any fear about waiting things out to ship something that they
[00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:45.200]   can do very well today and delay other features uh for another year even if competing products have
[00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:51.440]   those features it will be interesting to see the difference between uh android development where
[00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:57.040]   google really does give developers free reign to do anything except for destroy the world and even
[00:31:57.040 --> 00:32:01.360]   then they're willing to let them set fire to a continent if they if they want to be naughty
[00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:05.600]   right but we're asked we're asked yes i know you have this great idea for an app yes i know that
[00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:08.880]   you've built this entire system route we're telling you we're not going to let you do that for another
[00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:14.960]   year or maybe two or maybe three so it's going to be interesting to see how if people are in the store
[00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:21.440]   i've got on i've got on one hand i've got this $250 Moto 360 mark two on this other hand i've got the
[00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:28.080]   $350 apple watch that doesn't do quite as much and isn't quite as mature and has had as one year
[00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:33.280]   behind in development i wonder how people are going to react to that but then again it's it's
[00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:37.840]   this might be an artificial competition anyway because if you have an android phone you have to
[00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:42.080]   get an android where watch if you have an iPhone you have to get an apple watch so this might be
[00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:46.160]   just the sort of stuff that provides really great fodder for podcast discussion but won't really
[00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:51.600]   affect consumers in any significant way one other thing that everybody will pay attention to is battery
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:57.840]   life Renee have they said anything about an or do you know is is the apple watch going to protect
[00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:04.160]   itself against apps that will drain the battery apple's gotten very good at that or at least they've
[00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:08.640]   gotten good at battery shaming because you're not going to be running fullborn apps on the watch
[00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:12.240]   until next year they don't have to worry about third-party apps hitting the battery yet but they
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:16.320]   have said that you're going to have to charge it every night and one thing just to Andy's point
[00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:20.480]   it's it's hard to say that the apple watch hasn't been in development for as long as android where
[00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:24.560]   because a lot of that is internal apple just doesn't release early stage products and the
[00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:29.280]   difference is that the google where watch is going to be hit by public qa by thousands and thousands
[00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:32.800]   of people much earlier than the watch does and that can make a difference in the maturity i was
[00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:37.600]   referring i'm sorry i was referring most most two third-party development uh where there's going to be
[00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:43.120]   a especially you can actually see and use the american airlines watch app on uh on moto 360
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:47.040]   it's still hypothetical in just a demonstration on the apple watch this one well generally you
[00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:53.280]   did a great job we we watched the entire video we didn't have any audio but we watched the entire
[00:33:53.280 --> 00:34:01.520]   video while we were talking 30 minutes um i i have to say i'm excited uh there are lots of questions
[00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:06.880]   unanswered um but i'm very excited let's talk about the point ones in just a second oh Leo we did
[00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:10.080]   forget to say mention that apple pay is going to be on the apple watch too so if that's a big deal
[00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:14.640]   to you you're going to want apple uh excellent point although i think i've just say now uh after
[00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:19.760]   the smoke is cleared on apple pay we're starting to see numbers for instance mcdonald's saying
[00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:24.000]   50 percent of its transactions now are apple pay but that of tap to pay transactions but that
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:32.080]   means that 50 percent are android or credit card tap to pay uh and i'm and i'm both uh both uh the
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:37.200]   Verizon carrier solution soft card and google wallet have both said they've seen increased
[00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:41.760]   usage since apple pay came out so i don't think there's i don't know what kind of differentiator
[00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:47.120]   apple pay on a watch will be maybe a simple simple awareness of tap to pay is almost negligible
[00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:51.520]   now i i sort of expect that when i use tap to pay it will come with it will come with five
[00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:55.440]   minutes of me explaining how it works to whoever was waiting in line behind me these these poor
[00:34:55.440 --> 00:35:00.000]   i tweeted i had a tweet about my last experience say that oh this poor poor woman she didn't she
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:04.880]   didn't realize i have two hours of material on tap to pay she just she probably just wanted
[00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:10.880]   to say what is that does it does it work is it safe and is work or else can you use it and i'm
[00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:15.040]   saying well we have to go back to first i have this thing called a java ring now this was sort of a
[00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:20.160]   microcontroller based ring sort of thing that was like oh good i just want to get a burger and go
[00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:25.840]   way i'm so sorry i met you now and i'm in common here whole food said in the first week 150 000
[00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:31.440]   people used apple pay and whole food so i think the awareness going up is good because uh you know
[00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:36.320]   the stores the retail the clerks the people will be much more prepared for you to use it you won't
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:41.040]   there'll be less of a barrier to you saying you know i'm gonna i'm gonna tap my phone now is that
[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:48.080]   okay and uh i think the raising awareness is gonna help everybody so i think you're right i think
[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:51.680]   anybody who buys a phone is going to ask for tap to pay i don't know if it's going to sell more
[00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:56.400]   watches maybe do you is it really that big a difference between tapping your watch
[00:35:56.400 --> 00:36:00.640]   tapping your phone hey i've been wrong on this all along so it means it's a good job without your
[00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:08.000]   phone yeah well and i think that i you know i uh i was at a hotel as usual yesterday and and i
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.600]   have to admit it was it was one of the ones that should be covering it i just didn't know how to get
[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:16.480]   my iPhone to really work with it um and uh so i ended up using their key which was fine but it
[00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:19.760]   would have been nice i mean i have to admit i would think that it was kind of cool i don't know if i'd
[00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:24.000]   buy a watch because of this but if i just tap my watch up against my hotel room you know and and
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.480]   be able to i mean theoretically be able to walk right through i mean when you think about even as
[00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:33.920]   we reduce friction you know i i was flying last night and and the the fact that i could have an
[00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:38.480]   electronic ticket for my united flight i was able to go through tsa i mean i literally got to the front
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:46.880]   of um of the airport at 503 and was standing at the gate at 507 and that is a massive reduction in
[00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:51.520]   in um in friction and i think that you you get used to that and for instance once you get used to
[00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:56.720]   something like tsa pre you won't even go into the other lines you'll walk like six more you know
[00:36:56.720 --> 00:37:00.240]   sections down to go to yours you really i don't want to take all the stuff out and i think people
[00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:04.400]   get used to a lot of that as we we're going to see a huge reduction in friction over the next five
[00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:09.920]   years as we start to tie in the nfc and the and the watches and everything else where we look back on
[00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:16.960]   what we had to do before and i think we'll you know it'll seem a kind of absurd as i said it's
[00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:23.200]   it's the it everybody's got their little thing that they're saying right now if it just did this
[00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:28.560]   you got a sale if you if you can solve a daily or even or even better yet an hourly problem for
[00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:33.600]   somebody they won't they won't care that it smells of olives they will say we'll buy that phone and
[00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:37.840]   they will use it well and i think that one of the things is also separating some of the things
[00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:43.200]   away like i i wouldn't mind having notifications on my watch i turn off almost all the notifications
[00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:46.880]   on my phone because i'm in the middle of stuff all the time and i get keep on getting interrupted
[00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:50.160]   and so i like i'm in the middle of a call or on the middle of something else and i don't want
[00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:54.240]   any notifications to turn on while i'm doing that whereas i might be more open to that so being
[00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:57.760]   able to split some of these things to different things i don't necessarily want it going on all
[00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:02.320]   the devices i wanted to say i want this on this device and this on this device and i think that that
[00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:08.240]   is something that i think people will slowly kind of nurture and mature we're talking apple a mac
[00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:13.280]   break weekly andy and not go rene richy alex lindsey and we will talk about the point ones
[00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:19.680]   in just a second but first a word from shutterstock.com at shutterstock you're going to find the perfect
[00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:25.040]   image or video for your next creative project whether it's a website a publication and advertisement
[00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:30.560]   a lot of lot of filmmakers use shutterstock for stock a video if you click the footage tab at the
[00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:34.080]   top of the shutterstock page you'll see an amazing collection over a million
[00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:40.880]   uh i'm sorry now over two million why they just they're always adding more stuff
[00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:46.880]   two million worldied free stock videos last time i checked there were something like 40 million
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:53.920]   photos and illustrations at shutterstock.com i mean they just guys and every week they add another
[00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:58.000]   quarter million to three hundred thousand new illustration look at that wouldn't that be great
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.920]   the next time you're making interstellar you could just save yourself a lot of time and money
[00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:06.560]   and just use some shutterstock footage there you go and one of the things that even even with
[00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:11.600]   some of the stills one of the tricks that that i've used actually in a couple films is uh taking
[00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:17.680]   a skyline you know so a bank ox skyline or trying and you literally take the image that you get from
[00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:23.280]   stock photo and you actually map it on to some very basic 3d models and push your camera through
[00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:28.240]   it and you feel like you did a big you know helicopter shots or you know for the price of one image and
[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:32.720]   literally it takes you an hour or two to kind of set it up and it's a great way to you know so you
[00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:37.600]   take one of those and you put some boxes where all those buildings are push into it and as a viewer
[00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:40.880]   especially if you're only going to see it for a couple seconds you totally sell the shot that

[00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:37.680]   for bernie and aprichie the watch resolutions are 272 by 340 for the 38 millimeter and 312 by 390
[00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:43.680]   for the uh 42 millimeter what's the dpi can we calculate that uh probably i don't have a
[00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:49.360]   i don't have p calc in front of me and dpi calculator there's a great dpi calculator on the
[00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:55.520]   web let me just let me enter this all in here so uh on the high resolution it you said what
[00:41:55.520 --> 00:42:04.160]   so the 38 millimeter is 272 by 340 by 340 now uh oh it's in inches
[00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:13.600]   hmm i'm gonna have to now do how many millimeters 38 millimeters in inches convert
[00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:22.400]   38 millimeter inches it's like five inches all right it's a 1.49606 according to the google
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:27.440]   according to the watch let's let's put put that in here your watch you did that on your watch
[00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:32.800]   yeah so this i i use this for like questions like trivia questions all the time that's excellent
[00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:41.600]   that's 291 ppi not bad that's excellent not bad that's retina baby yep
[00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:49.920]   all depends on how long your arms are uh you know what i'm mind uh my new uh my new kindle voyage
[00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:57.520]   the one we were singing its praises 300 ppi so 291 i'll take better than the ipad uh air
[00:42:57.520 --> 00:43:07.200]   yeah that air is 264 and what's the other resolution 312 by 390 and that is and that's on the on the
[00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:13.840]   on the uh little one that's that's the 42 millimeter oh crap now i have to do this okay convert 42
[00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:21.200]   that's 1.6 let's copy that you see there's this talk about real-time updates all right and
[00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:28.560]   let's see what that is 300 that's over 300 ppi so we're we're hovering around 300 dots per inch on
[00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:34.240]   both of these displays that's good yeah that's plenty that's a lot better isn't it Andy than the
[00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:39.040]   android wear stuff i think so yeah you can you can definitely if you look close enough on on these
[00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:45.040]   watches you can see you can see the dots yeah not not so much that and you would be taken seriously
[00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:49.760]   as someone who is it's like you you if your complaint is that hey if i look really really
[00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:53.440]   closely i can see the dots it doesn't affect the clarity of the of the thing yeah but that really
[00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:57.120]   depends on what kind of apps that uh apple and apple developers choose to build for it if they
[00:43:57.120 --> 00:44:00.960]   build apps that really do take advantage of that display i mean having having been there in the
[00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:06.000]   room and having been able to see those watches yeah i mean there's it's as good as any iPhone
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:12.160]   screen and it really is impressive uh but i would i would rather take a drop in resolution to a
[00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:16.960]   drop in functionality if that turns out to be the case so it's nice but it's not definitive and
[00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:22.320]   also good it's also good to ask the question of what will that do to the battery life of the device
[00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:27.200]   right there's a lot of pixels right now this this is no to the 360 is semi-notorious for not
[00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:32.000]   having a really good battery or not having a really good energy efficient cpu and i easily get two
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:36.960]   days worth of use out of it yeah but you have to be uh you have to be thoughtful for instance and
[00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:41.040]   this is something people probably aren't yet ready to do but you have or ready to think about but
[00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:45.040]   for instance if you put a second a moving second hand a sweep second hand on your watch it kills
[00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:48.960]   the battery faster than if there's no second hand because it because it's a screen and that's
[00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:55.040]   updated uh and there's and i do you want to keep the the screen lit all the time or you just want
[00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:59.680]   to light up when you turn your wrist uh that sort of stuff so it is going to be highly subjective
[00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:03.920]   also it's going to depend on if you have like terrible connectivity uh with your with your watch
[00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:07.040]   for whatever excuse me with your phone and with the internet for whatever reason that's gonna
[00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:12.000]   there's so many factors that apple's gonna i'm i believe that apple is going to be on top of in
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:17.360]   a way that Motorola was not at the launch of uh their own watch i'm on hopes i'm finding 205 pixels
[00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:21.920]   per inch for the moto okay well it's not bad that's not bad but it's that's fine i mean don't you
[00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:26.000]   i mean even apple doesn't play the battle of the numbers they basically say well what do we do
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:30.240]   with the resolution that's green what do we do with this with the clock cycles of this uh CPU
[00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:33.200]   you know it has to be good enough so that when you put the rolex
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:37.200]   time uh watch face on it it actually looks like a rolex that's all they haven't said you can
[00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:41.760]   make custom watch faces yet let's find out oh yeah they may not you can on android where
[00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:45.680]   that's the that's the sort of stuff that i'm talking about in terms of having having more
[00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:51.360]   development time uh where uh app of google is going to be releasing the next version of the android
[00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:56.080]   where operating system and one of them is going to be to make it really really easy to design
[00:45:56.080 --> 00:46:00.880]   custom watch face apps uh Motorola released an update to this specific piece of hardware last
[00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:05.360]   month or excuse me a couple of weeks ago that simply says we won't let you simply design anything
[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:11.280]   willy nilly but we'll let you put whatever you know this this did not ship with a with a squirrel
[00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:15.680]   watch face this is a photo that actually put on there uh and you can change the it can change
[00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:20.080]   the watch hands and stuff like that and that's that's there's there's so many questions that we're
[00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:24.320]   there's so many questions that we're still trying to answer on what people like about this
[00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:27.920]   and one of the things that i think is going to be significant is the idea that like i think one
[00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:31.680]   of the things that moto rol got very much right is that there is like like i said before there is
[00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:36.640]   nothing to this hardware except for just the thinnest bezel possible to highlight the screen
[00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:42.480]   and so it's uh i wish that it had swappable bands as easily as the uh apple watch does but
[00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:48.800]   if it made it very as easy to swap out uh watch faces to my liking uh on a whim as it as it is to
[00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:53.440]   switch out uh watch bands and the apple watch well that's not that's not a bad trade-off either
[00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:57.520]   so i i wonder how i wonder what people are going to like about customizing these things and whether
[00:46:57.520 --> 00:47:02.640]   they're going to the the idea that it's they're they're they're putting the same watch on to go to a
[00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:07.920]   family wedding as they were just for a weekend uh with with friends but the feel is though you know
[00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:12.320]   what i i shouldn't have the squirrel watch face on for the wedding i should put on the rolex watch
[00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:17.360]   face just just to make just to make sure my parents know that i've made it well an apple with a snap
[00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:23.120]   on and off a band really doesn't it does foster that i mean i think you could be very happy with
[00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:28.800]   the steel watch i hope i could be very happy with the steel watch and a couple of good bands you know
[00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:33.200]   one for daily use one for weddings i got i got to tell you in my case it's not weddings it's
[00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:38.080]   funerals but you know same idea yeah i i am terrified of what the pricing is going to be on the on these
[00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:42.400]   other two uh they they said the minimum buying is going to be 350 that's that's acceptable especially
[00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:47.200]   for an apple product but i am terrified when they show off what what's going to cost to have
[00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:52.240]   the stainless steel version of it and i'm prepared to just say it may as well be 10 million dollars
[00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:57.040]   where you're going to charge for the gold one because you're marketing to people that are my
[00:47:57.040 --> 00:48:02.880]   lead baby it's like okay let's let's let's get let's get good and let's get let's get good and
[00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:07.200]   liquored up for that show we know they're going to announce the price of this before or sometime
[00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:13.600]   during when we record because like okay i got three people wasn't me i'm ready yeah people like
[00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:17.360]   my friend kevin mitchell who he gets more excited the higher he thinks the price is going to be a
[00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:22.880]   10 grand he's interested at 20 grand he's really interested he's one of those guys he's a watch guy
[00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:28.400]   this way i i i i i'm contacting my relatives to find out how much did grandma and grandpa pay for
[00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:33.360]   their first house because i feel like i'm going to need that dollar figure when i write my my commentary
[00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:41.840]   that's your limit i know i know you know i've spent a couple of cases a lot of money for watches
[00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:49.120]   not Rolex money but pretty hefty some painful some and uh and i know they were rip off it was a
[00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:56.320]   ripoff it was it's it's it's a it's jewelry status it doesn't you know and and i guess that softened
[00:48:56.320 --> 00:49:02.160]   me up but i i'm i i like you andi i'm a little worried because let me tell you the story of a young
[00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:07.920]   teenage boy who was a goat herder in the hills of the atalian apps who came here with only a three
[00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:13.680]   million dollars in his pocket amazed that he could provide a home for himself and his small family
[00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:18.160]   and really let's let's imagine this young boy spending a lot of money on a watch is absolutely
[00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:24.400]   the worst kind of conspicuous consumption because a five dollar watch is exactly as good as a fifty
[00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:31.040]   thousand dollar watch saying that toy always as good as a lamborghini lio no it's not time is time
[00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:37.200]   it doesn't tell the time faster it doesn't time the time better in fact probably it's less accurate
[00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:40.480]   than the five dollar watch i mean i think i think and i think it's going to be hard to tell the
[00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:44.640]   difference between the elum i mean decide between the aluminum and uh and the stainless steel and
[00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:49.840]   the gold i mean but the you know there are reasons that you buy different different watches i mean i
[00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:54.960]   the only reason why the gold is to show you have so much money no you don't care you're right you're
[00:49:54.960 --> 00:50:00.560]   in the gold the gold one is ostentations i i couldn't be seen in that go ahead i was i was thinking
[00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:04.720]   about the buying decision between do i want the stainless steel watch or do i want the aluminum
[00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:09.920]   watch and four months worth of heating oil this winter hmm yeah oh my thing is is that i want to
[00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:15.920]   know when i get the the rubberized g-shock watch like that's that's what i want it's like a rubberized
[00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:21.520]   rubberized one that'll be perfect of the the single most brilliant use of this will be to buy the
[00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:27.120]   gold watch but also to like kickstart like a rubber g-shocks like carrying case for it it's only
[00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:33.920]   working on the gold watch this is just for the gold life proof case yeah exactly apparently our uh
[00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:42.320]   our friend kevin rose who is a watch hound has created a new watch app called watch ville
[00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:49.760]   an app that aggregates news from top wristwatch blogs and offers an atomic clock
[00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:55.040]   tool to help you set your timepiece and its moon phases and look who already has it
[00:50:55.040 --> 00:51:01.760]   you see that that's that's that's just that's just a bad marketing decision because the people
[00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:06.480]   who using their phones to get their time anyway aren't going to be buying watches are there are they
[00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:11.920]   i'm sorry you're this is the worst pitch we've had on shark you use it to set your watch i'm out
[00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:18.560]   that's the punchline to the joke after after you spend 10 minutes explaining how this
[00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:22.720]   $8,000 watch what the what the different gears and dials and all the different movements are well
[00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:27.840]   what time is it it's actually kevin tells an interesting story he says when his father passed
[00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:31.520]   away which wasn't so long ago that was just a few years ago he says i wasn't a watch guy to my dad
[00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:39.200]   died and he handed me down a Rolex and he said it was pretty much all he could afford so he spent
[00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:43.760]   a lot of time and care on it that is one big difference a high quality watch and we've mentioned
[00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:50.480]   this before is an heirloom not a high quality apple watch i have my grandfather's watch has
[00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:56.560]   been a fact it was my dad's watch so yeah and i should i'm sorry i've i've a meaning to say if you
[00:51:56.560 --> 00:52:00.880]   if you can afford a really expensive watch and you can enjoy it really expensive watch i absolutely
[00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:06.320]   i'm not judging you i i i will i will i will have some fun at the expense of the most what might be
[00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:12.000]   the most expensive thing apple has ever sold and it doesn't even have a usb port on it but uh if
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:16.160]   yeah i i will not diss somebody for having a love i have friends who have like really really nice
[00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:21.200]   watches and you could tell that this was not something that they bought just because they saw it in a
[00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:25.440]   ad in a cigar magazine and they wanted to look like the guy in the in the magazine ad they have an
[00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:31.920]   actual love of this sort of stuff so i i'm not in any way denigrating that i have to think i make
[00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:37.840]   a little judgment in my mind all he wanted was a plot of land but maybe can grow some tomatoes in
[00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:43.760]   the back raises two children and teach them to be good america it's it's it's i'm torn between you know
[00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:50.720]   uh disregard and intense jealousy i i owe the jealousy too i'm not i'm not the lady jealous
[00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:57.760]   oh i want that rolex that i you know but at the same time i can't it's just you know having a
[00:52:57.760 --> 00:53:04.160]   something a fifty thousand dollar thing on your wrist it's like what yeah and these are again i
[00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:09.680]   have friends with these nice watches and i've they've let me they let me wear them like for a day uh
[00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:14.560]   when i was when i bought uh when i bought this watch and i was trying to figure out if i really
[00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:19.200]   wanted to have this this was a big watch compared to what i was wearing before and so i went to where
[00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:23.440]   i've got to watch exactly that same size once you wear that for a day and it really is just a
[00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:28.640]   beautiful that the weight of it you really do appreciate that this is a really nicely made
[00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:34.240]   mechanical object it is like love of cars it really is like love of sculpture there's just
[00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:38.720]   an appreciation of it that goes beyond its immediate function well i mean it is an heirloom i mean
[00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:43.680]   you can't hand that and that and lovely time time piece and you can get it fixed and and 30 years
[00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:48.720]   from now you can get it fixed when that that was my uh like that was my dad's birthday present one
[00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:52.960]   year where he he broke it and it was in a drawer for about four five or six or seven eight years
[00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:57.200]   and i had my mom sneak it out and i took two three different watchmakers who rebuilt it and
[00:53:57.200 --> 00:54:02.960]   it was working fine again i'm not sure if i'm hoping that they'll they'll be people the the the the 20
[00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:08.000]   the 2081 version of ben heck will have a watch repair shop who will say i think i can make the
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:15.600]   smaller yeah will the apple watch hold its value that no it'll be the same as the
[00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:20.720]   electron over decades over decades no it will have resale value in the terms in the in the same way
[00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:24.720]   that old ipads are brilliant because you can get at least half of your money back from them
[00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:29.600]   whenever you decide to upgrade so they'll they'll definitely be that but in terms of i spent
[00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:34.080]   x thousands of dollars for this gold watch there'll be it's some there'll be some point
[00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:38.160]   unless apple has designed it specifically so that you can replace the innards and upgrade the
[00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:43.520]   electronics uh eight for like five or ten years there'll be a point at which there's be a company
[00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:48.080]   that you mail this gold apple watch to and they will give you a fair market value for the gold
[00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:53.840]   that's in the side of watching so sad send send send you back your peel off spring protector that
[00:54:53.840 --> 00:54:58.560]   you fade it's 80 cents for we will have i'll tell you what when uh when we do get to that day when
[00:54:58.560 --> 00:55:03.360]   we're gonna announce the uh prices and availability on the apple watch we will have rich seagull
[00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:09.520]   join us from bareboat software creator bb edit who is in fact a watch hound we should we should
[00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:15.280]   also we should uh we should also have dave nanian of uh who does uh super duper okay because he's
[00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:20.320]   also he is also uh a watch collector and he has at his ego to his house and you see like it's sort
[00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:25.600]   of like really wonka's dresser top because there are these machines that do nothing but tumble these
[00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:31.280]   these self-winding watches and he and even the and even the automatic watch winders are really
[00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:38.880]   well designed and really well made and the oh lord if i if i with my my respect for people who have
[00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:42.880]   an appreciation for fine watches comes from my friendship with both of these men i don't know how
[00:55:42.880 --> 00:55:47.680]   much disposable income i'd have to have before i would get into that but i think it would be a
[00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:56.880]   significant amount oh huh it'd be a sentence for duper first thing i'm gonna do is gonna buy
[00:55:56.880 --> 00:56:02.400]   rene a good to skype connection actually we're now on hangouts and it's still not working now i
[00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:06.800]   think that new oil pipeline uh between canada united states on the way up there we can just shove
[00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:11.920]   some internet put some bits in there uh because it'll be empty going back exactly by waste why
[00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:16.000]   wasted we would they got to maintain the pressure somehow we can fill it with electrons
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:22.640]   i really you know i have to really be careful because i could just feel myself sucked into the
[00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:29.440]   watch vortex yeah i know because the the the saving grace is that i will i will i'll be wearing one of
[00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:33.280]   these things for the days while this is this is really this is really nice maybe i would like it
[00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:39.440]   and then how much is that like it's not it's it's like if it were a five hundred dollar watch then i
[00:56:39.440 --> 00:56:44.800]   would have a problem if it were a two thousand dollar watch oh that's not that's easy no who i uh
[00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:50.880]   i don't want to double the value of my car by being inside it with this watch but i do think i think
[00:56:50.880 --> 00:56:54.160]   it's going to be really interesting when you when you when you look at whether it's this this is the
[00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:57.040]   beginning of these watches of course what's going to happen is we're going to end up with a lot of
[00:56:57.040 --> 00:57:01.280]   less much less expensive android watches that are doing many things and it's interesting to think
[00:57:01.280 --> 00:57:05.520]   about watch watch manufacturers i may look at the watch that i have now this uh the citizen and um
[00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:10.240]   and i look at it and i go oh this is so cute but i know i'm looking to wear it for another year
[00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:14.400]   you know like like as soon as it's released as soon as i put the apple watch on i i've had the same
[00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:20.640]   watch or the same style of watch for probably it over a decade and um and uh but i look at it i
[00:57:20.640 --> 00:57:23.920]   keep on looking like i really really thought you were great you know it's not like you were a bad
[00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:30.560]   girlfriend but yeah that's that's that's that's exactly it because i love this watch i still do
[00:57:30.560 --> 00:57:34.960]   but it doesn't do the cool stuff that this does that that really makes me like you know you're just
[00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:39.680]   and i i kind of this is why i have not put this away it's like maybe like i should tell myself
[00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:43.280]   that maybe i will wear this on the weekends or maybe at least the weekends i know like like that's
[00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:48.960]   like my my deck i i feel like i'm gonna keep i keep my citizen around just so that so that um
[00:57:48.960 --> 00:57:52.800]   when i decide i'm gonna go off the grid for a weekend or a day or whatever i'm gonna take the
[00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:57.120]   watch off i'm gonna put the citizen on and that's like me telling myself that you know still spending
[00:57:57.120 --> 00:58:01.200]   some time again with the old girlfriends you know you know just say you know it wasn't you it wasn't
[00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:07.680]   you it was just that she was just you know you walk past you walk past your middle school playground
[00:58:07.680 --> 00:58:12.080]   and if no one's looking you just want to jump on the springy horse just for once or twice just to
[00:58:12.080 --> 00:58:16.640]   relive the old thrills and then you jump off and the phone behind i'm leaving i'm you know i'm gonna
[00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:20.720]   leave the phone behind i'm gonna put the watch down and i'm just gonna hang out on the beach i think
[00:58:20.720 --> 00:58:26.480]   someday i'll do that i haven't done that in a long time but someday i can dream and the cats in the
[00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:32.720]   cradle in the suit i know it's gonna happen i'm gonna buy a fantastic watch and as i walk out the
[00:58:32.720 --> 00:58:39.920]   door i'm having a heart attack and henry's gonna inherit it like instantly so how would you like
[00:58:39.920 --> 00:58:46.720]   to maybe get some money to buy that next watch i got an idea for you gazelle.com start selling your
[00:58:46.720 --> 00:58:51.920]   gadgets now and maybe by the time the apple watch comes out you'll have enough money what's great
[00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:56.000]   about gazelle.com is you can go there right now and get a 30-day quote a quote that's good for the
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:59:02.320]   next 30 days if you think you might want to do it do it that way you'll have the quote there's no
[00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:09.360]   commitment i can guarantee you no device is going up in value we're talking about iPhones iPads
[00:59:09.360 --> 00:59:17.600]   cell phones from blackberry and samsung all the manufacturers l g h t c motorolla nokia we're
[00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:24.640]   talking tablets from amazon a sus google microsoft samsung as well as apple great prices and they
[00:59:24.640 --> 00:59:29.680]   make it very easy so you'll get the quote 30 days gives you enough time to get the new device transfer
[00:59:29.680 --> 00:59:35.200]   the data over wipe the old device then say okay i'm ready to sell it and they'll send you a box
[00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:40.640]   with prepaid shipping you don't pay any shipping on this pile all those gadgets in they turn it
[00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:45.520]   around fast if you forget to wipe the data what's four to ten bucks for an iphone six well there you
[00:59:45.520 --> 00:59:54.000]   go i'm not selling my phone that would be an ohenry story he sold his iphone six to buy an apple watch
[00:59:54.000 --> 01:00:02.960]   and he couldn't use it don't say you need your iphone okay i'm just saying you can get a check
[01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:09.360]   a paypal credit if you're in a hurry or if you are an amazon buyer you do a lot of amazon shopping
[01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:15.760]   as i do get the amazon gift card they'll bump the value an extra five percent go to gazelle.com get
[01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:19.760]   an offer for your iphone or ipad and lock in today's price for 30 days they even buy broken
[01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:27.120]   iPhones and ipads gazelle.com they've paid out nearly 170 million dollars to over a million customers
[01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:33.120]   and and it's easy and we've certainly used it a lot in fact i think maybe
[01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:39.120]   i i have been saving up for my apple watch but instead of saving cash i just save old cell phones
[01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:46.320]   and i'm gonna cash him in on gazelle.com but do it now because it's not getting more valuable gazelle.com
[01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:51.040]   all right should we upgrade i we got two upgrades you've got Yosemite
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:59.280]   OS 10 10.10.1 and we've got iOS 8.1.1 let's start with Yosemite
[01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:06.960]   biggest problem on Yosemite has been Wi-Fi i have not experienced that but there seem to be widespread
[01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:14.800]   Wi-Fi issues and now even though 10.1.1 just came 10.1 just came out people are already saying oh
[01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:19.200]   it doesn't necessarily fix the Wi-Fi what are you hearing Renee?
[01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:24.960]   so every time there's an update it will cause Wi-Fi problems for some people come to realize that this
[01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:28.800]   is just the truth of the universe and there's no rhyme or reason to it but for people who had the
[01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:34.160]   specific bug with Yosemite where it would change the network or drop the network it does fix that
[01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:37.920]   bug there might be other bugs that people have or other issues that they have but the main issue
[01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:43.680]   with Yosemite is fixed with 10.1.1. and what was Evan Cass's fix if you you would
[01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:49.840]   disable the administrator sorry enable the administrator to change for for Wi-Fi networks
[01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:53.120]   and if you enable the administrator page that's it or do you have to
[01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:58.960]   this fixes that as far as i know like on any system that we had trouble with this has so far
[01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:04.480]   fixed that all right there's an article on iMORT explains how to do it's not hard no
[01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:10.160]   but i don't know how to do it so or i would show you it also fixes at least for me and
[01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:13.520]   several people have fixed that really annoying error where bonjour put multiple versions of your
[01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:17.440]   computer up so you would have like macbook pro one two three four five six seven eight nine 10
[01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:22.560]   up to a hundred sometimes i think rich seagull tweeted that he had 2073 apple tvs at one point
[01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:26.800]   that's what that i don't know if the apple tv version is fixed but the version for macs is
[01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:34.800]   definitely fixed wait a minute say that again he had what he had 200 s 2073 uh bathroom apple tv
[01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:40.400]   is listed on that he actually gatted him and he said well no he was just a no because he puts
[01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:44.080]   the number in brackets next to them and he was just adding instead of replacing it with the new
[01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:49.040]   which kept adding to the list that seems to be a problem but he says nobody has had many bathrooms
[01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:54.400]   let let's not gloss over the fact that rich seagull has an apple tv in his bathroom that man is
[01:02:54.400 --> 01:03:01.520]   trying to gloss that that is that's boss okay so the apple tv part and i don't think it's all
[01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:06.000]   what the mac version is fixed okay all all over the world listeners are saying honey
[01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:15.680]   i wish you could apple tv for our bathroom so um let me ask a question about uh this
[01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:21.600]   wifi thing because i have many macs and i have not seen it do we know why some people have this
[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:26.880]   problem and some don't no but it happens every update i have never had a wifi issue but i know
[01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:31.520]   people who have it almost consistently and it doesn't seem weird yeah it seems like there's
[01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:35.440]   just so many millions of devices that some you know two three percent which is a lot of people
[01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:37.200]   will get these issues every time yeah
[01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:44.640]   you'd think it'd be somehow reproducible yeah that's why i think it happens every time is that
[01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:49.280]   it's always some sort of edge case yeah in some stacks on why does apple seems to have more trouble
[01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:53.920]   with wifi than any other company though is that not i mean i was having the same problem with iOS8
[01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:59.680]   on a lot of my uh a lot of my devices that weren't being reproduced on iOS7 or iOS6 or any of my
[01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:04.080]   android or other devices um and this this is like what remember a couple months ago when we're
[01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:10.720]   talking about the quote bending problem on the iphone six if we hear a dozen well publicized cases
[01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:14.480]   then these are just random things that well once you put a million of these in people's hands things
[01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:18.480]   are going to happen even if it's just two or three percent of the other people if enough of these
[01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:22.800]   people are now having these problems that this is a serious issue because it's only it's only it's
[01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:27.120]   only okay if you're part of the 97 percent and you're probably everybody wins the everybody wins that
[01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:33.120]   bad lottery at some point in life well and i think i think that i don't know if it's any worse on a mac
[01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:36.800]   i think i think sometimes there's just so many problems on a pc side that you just don't notice
[01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:41.440]   and anything with anything with networking i'm willing to be so forgiving not that i enjoy not
[01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:47.680]   having wifi but i can't really say oh with with a magsafe connector i can say okay did you even try
[01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:52.080]   plugging this in and sitting with sitting with a magbook on a sofa i will be that arrogant when it
[01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:56.160]   comes to the magsafe to connector when it comes to networking it's like there's so many variables
[01:04:56.160 --> 01:05:00.240]   yeah you cannot test for all of them the only thing you can do is at some point think that okay
[01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:06.000]   i've done my i've been diligent as possible in making this work and it will build the the last step is
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:10.480]   to release it and then find out who's who's getting failures Alex you've always said don't
[01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:16.000]   download the new operating system don't download the first update to the new operating system
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:21.120]   wait and download it all when they've update the update and that's you know and yeah and that's
[01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:24.880]   what we're doing i mean we're still we still have computers that are kind of in all in the last
[01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:28.400]   three versions we're still not taking some of the machines out the current machine that i'm on
[01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:34.240]   right now is a 10 till 1086 and that is because my Cisco camera stopped working on Skype and
[01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:40.880]   hangouts on Mavericks and Yosemite and and so we still have a couple machines that are on the
[01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:44.880]   older one we've got someone Mavericks that we're still you know working with and then we're moving
[01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:49.440]   somebody i think we're going to move almost everything now to Yosemite that is in Mavericks
[01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:53.040]   we're going to keep our 1086 computers around because there's still a couple pieces of hardware
[01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:57.360]   that don't work on Mavericks and Yosemite so i have a handful of machines that can do that and then
[01:05:57.360 --> 01:05:59.920]   otherwise i think we're about ready to just because Mavericks just is
[01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:07.760]   crap so i'm gonna really it's not bad it's just it well from an audiovisual perspective from a
[01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:11.200]   you know it the whole thing had never really worked which is why we tested here and there
[01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:14.800]   not move it Yosemite's an improvement i think over Mavericks Mavericks we pretty much skipped
[01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:19.520]   you know other than a handful of computers i just i really feel like i think the real
[01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:24.640]   i think Apple's at i think this yearly update thing is is really not a good idea for Apple i
[01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:28.320]   think that i get that it's free and everything else but i feel like we're packing a bunch of
[01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:31.840]   features in and we're not going back and cleaning everything up and i think they
[01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:35.920]   don't they don't they alternate stability releases with new feature releases
[01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:42.160]   i i not anymore yeah it's a lot of people think they need us no leopard moment they need a
[01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:46.080]   snow leopard moment i thought this would be our snow leopard moment it's not when they
[01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:49.200]   added a lot of things i mean they add a lot of things to Yosemite and i think that there there's
[01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:52.800]   little bit of one-upmanship going on there i think they need to stop i'd be quite happy for them to
[01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:56.480]   stay in Yosemite for the next two or three years and just work on stability you know i think
[01:06:56.480 --> 01:06:59.840]   we're just going to keep on doing but not ones i don't think they need to add anything i don't
[01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:03.920]   really need my operating system to change that much i just needed to get better and you know 10-8
[01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:09.520]   sex in my opinion was the last fully stable you know operating system yeah but trust relate
[01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:14.240]   hard-sold snow leopard to apple i mean they he had to campaign to get that done and he didn't
[01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:18.240]   want to see if someone else does that yeah the the idea that let's just uh yeah
[01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:24.000]   tread water for a bit and really make sure this is rock solid make an update that's just solid
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:30.560]   solid you know microsoft kind of does that um you know windows 7 was a response to vista
[01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:36.640]   um i don't know when in windows 8 is like a big change but windows 9 no bugs windows 9
[01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:41.360]   will have zero bugs yeah 10 it's gonna be 10 they skip 9 sorry i was kidding that's why 9
[01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:47.200]   will have no bugs i get it i'm sorry i'm a little slow so our advice to people using Yosemite is
[01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:52.800]   upgrade or not yes yes this is Alex's you know this is the bug fix of the bug fix so this is right
[01:07:52.800 --> 01:08:00.240]   exactly and it could screw you up with Wi-Fi it'll fix you're more if you had a problem it'll most
[01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:04.560]   likely fix it i haven't heard of that many new problems okay the old problem and it's it's not
[01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:09.280]   gonna if you if you don't have a problem it's not gonna give you a problem there's a statistic
[01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:12.960]   chance every time Leo i mean you're taking a little bit of your life in your hands with any
[01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:18.640]   update i just wanted to put out the disclaimer we make note we make no promises but i would send
[01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:25.040]   a point uh 8.1.1 is is a really good update if you've been waiting on iOS 8 this this one it
[01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:29.920]   fix if you have an iPad this will give you back oh up you know up half a gig or a gig of storage
[01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:34.880]   capacity on it's awesome the performance is great it's better for the 4s it's better for the iPad
[01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:40.000]   too it's better for all of them in general it feels very polished very stable there's this old joke
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:43.600]   that you you know you get the release and you get the hurry up you know patch all this broken
[01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:49.040]   release and then you get the fix release and this really feels like the fix release so get 8.1.1 as
[01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:57.040]   well yes okay so there's our advice do upgrade both cases yes these are yeah because both of
[01:08:57.040 --> 01:09:02.560]   these are fixes to the update and it's not the panic fix because you always get the panic fix
[01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:06.000]   a week or two out with something really badly is broken there's no time to do you know you just
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:09.760]   have to that's like all the red list items now this is the more proper fix and that's the part where
[01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:14.960]   people like me go oh we should know it was that was funny I mean you upgraded immediately that was
[01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:26.640]   yeah exactly that you install 8.0.1 huh yeah yeah yeah exactly so all right good all right so
[01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:32.400]   everybody should do your do your updates and they've already seated 8.2 the SDK I don't know if the
[01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:36.960]   beta is out yet I'm not sure the SDK is out because 8.2 is gonna enable the watch so that
[01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:41.120]   probably won't come out until spring of next year either okay so we're gonna be one 8.1 for a while
[01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:47.200]   yeah settle in folks interesting article actually wasn't an article it was a post
[01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:58.480]   about memory efficiency on Quora um Glenn Williams answered a question which a lot of people have
[01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:04.400]   how come the iPhones gigabyte of RAM is touted to be able to compete with two or in some cases
[01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:11.520]   three gigabytes of RAM on Android phones and Java it's Java it's well it's not even Java it's
[01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:18.960]   the garbage collection now I understand and know how garbage collection works and I uh I'm not sure I
[01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:28.960]   agree with this or disagree with it he he offers some graphs generated uh to show that because of
[01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:36.480]   garbage collection you want you want double or more the footprint in Android because of the way it
[01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:42.640]   handles memory then you do uh on iOS and I think this is one thing that even whether you're a
[01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:48.000]   sophisticated programmer and understand the differences or not it's observable that both iOS
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:53.680]   and Windows phone operate well with much less RAM than Android does and I even say I even tell
[01:10:53.680 --> 01:11:00.800]   people with Android get three gigs if you can uh it'll make a big difference yeah it is ironic though
[01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:05.280]   because it's apple it's pushing for 64-bit processors and as far as I'm concerned the only value to
[01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:12.080]   64-bit processors is more RAM it gave them the secure pipeline that let them do touch the end
[01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:17.600]   apple pay though that was that was part of the big 60 for secure kernel yeah it was secure and
[01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:23.120]   clave and now the secure element and you had to go 64-bit to do that uh it's got the ARM v8 had
[01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:26.400]   a lot of stuff built in a I'd again I don't know the details of the engine it wasn't about the
[01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:32.400]   bitage it was about it was about the ARM uh platform it was ARM v8 all the way absolutely
[01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:38.880]   the 64 bit was a nice a nice side effect of that nice old nosed week I'm sure the Android uh
[01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:45.920]   aficionados will have something to say about this post but it kind of makes sense it really really
[01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:52.640]   with the side though huh I mean with the go ahead what did you say Renee I was here I think apple
[01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:56.640]   tried uh garbage collection and accuracy for a very short time and then quickly got rid of it in
[01:11:56.640 --> 01:12:05.600]   favor of uh the auto release the arc right it its system is uh an enumeration right yeah so increments
[01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:13.360]   and then decrements garbage collection has to sweep through it a lot okay and go ahead Annie I'm
[01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:18.240]   sorry no I was just gonna say with 64-bit I the the more I the more I think about it and more if I
[01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:23.840]   look at things that are internal uh to these devices and to iOS and the more I talk to people the more
[01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:28.480]   I think that apple really is lining up planes on the runway for something really big for iPad
[01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:33.600]   2015 I would make the argument that they would do better with more RAM but safari has to refresh
[01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:38.720]   its tabs all the time the iPad 2 the iPad Air 2 has two gigabytes later that's preparing for something
[01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:44.400]   yeah yeah three gigabytes yeah that's that's that's I mean that's but that does point to there's so
[01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:50.720]   many differences between iOS and Android that go to such smart engineering behind the behind the
[01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:55.600]   scenes that apple is done uh garbage collection is one of them but battery conservation is another
[01:12:55.600 --> 01:13:01.360]   it's like I spend so much time evaluating Android tablets and Android phones and I'll have uh I
[01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:08.560]   haven't uh I'll I'll have charged up the iPhone 5s so that I can compare it to the iPhone 6
[01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:12.000]   and then I'll just like use it for a couple of days and then I'll put it in a drawer and then I need
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:15.920]   to oh did I get that picture off the iPhone 5s well make sure I find the charger and I haven't
[01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:21.520]   used it for three weeks and it's still at like 92 percent whereas an Android phone can barely stay
[01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:28.240]   alive for two days of of inactivity uh it's just amazing the the when you when you write the book on
[01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:34.560]   why iOS uh has is that half letter grade maybe better than uh Android a lot of is just that they've
[01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:39.280]   just done such smart things to keep the power on keep the water clean and to keep the earth from
[01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:44.080]   moving underneath people's feet I haven't charged my iPhone 6 plus since yesterday morning I'm at
[01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:49.280]   33 percent yeah actually they have looking one of them I think Glynn also says it's kind of uh
[01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:56.800]   germane is that uh not only does does uh garbage collection um inefficient with memory usage it
[01:13:56.800 --> 01:14:01.920]   requires more power so Android phones are using more power to do the garbage collection than
[01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:06.080]   iPhones have to I don't know what I saw it at CES but they had an Android in the car I think it was
[01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:10.560]   running gingerbread still but the guy had to tell you that uh it could only be in standby mode for
[01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:13.920]   seven days what would drain the car battery and then you had to power it off but when you powered
[01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:19.760]   off you would take three minutes to power on again right I just I just uh I just uh um uh download
[01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:24.640]   and installed uh Android L and one and one of the and one of the and one of the new features is
[01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:30.320]   battery shaming and it's like battery shocking because you see you're telling me that off of a
[01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:35.040]   fight a full charge at 1 p.m. and you think this is going to be dead one and a half hours from now
[01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:38.880]   do you think five hours of battery life is acceptable mr battery manager
[01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:42.880]   and they're really excited about we'll get you we'll get you probably 90 minutes of
[01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:48.080]   additional battery life say look at what well you just look at what the iPhone is doing why can't
[01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:53.280]   you be more like the iPhone making me carry a battery charger if I'm leaving the house for more
[01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:57.600]   than eight hours well you could get a note for and then it's just carrying extra battery and just
[01:14:57.600 --> 01:15:04.000]   swapping it why is I you know I haven't noticed is iPhone 5 6 and 6 plus much better battery life
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:11.040]   6 plus 6 plus yeah well 6 plus I mean that's the one I mean I'm giving it up soon but I but it is
[01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:15.680]   the the one thing about it I just can't believe how long the battery lasts yeah so you don't need
[01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:20.720]   a mophie anymore no you I don't know if you fit it if you if you put a mophie on it it would it would
[01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:27.280]   no longer be a 6 plus it would be a small truck I think I think that I think that most people have
[01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:31.600]   a mophie or a battery extender not to get like a whole weekend of life out of but to make sure
[01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:36.640]   that no matter what they'll get a full day and my goodness you you have to basically crack open
[01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:41.760]   an iPhone 6 plus and short the battery terminals not to get a full day's worth the use out of it
[01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:47.280]   I mean you really are you really are talking in general use life of days so much so that I
[01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:51.600]   almost have to like keep a note of when was the last time this was charged just to make sure I
[01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:55.840]   appreciate how good this battery is you compare this to like the super-sized phones and android
[01:15:55.840 --> 01:16:01.280]   where the big plus of having that exercise and having the extra battery in there is that you
[01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:06.640]   almost get almost a full day and a half probably or maybe two days if you don't use it that much
[01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:12.960]   rest of the iPhone 6 plus it really is just you you it's it's only bad in that you might you
[01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:17.440]   might even break yourself of the habit of automatically putting it in the charger every single night
[01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:21.920]   because if you forget a night it's no problem you'll probably still have another full day if you
[01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:25.600]   forget that second night you'll probably have enough to get you to the office where you'll be
[01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:30.560]   able to plug in whereas with android you're like thank god this has such crappy battery life because
[01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:34.480]   I will never ever ever go to bed without plugging this into the charger before I fall asleep.
[01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:39.760]   I did singleton and the iPad event without a charge like I had my my my
[01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:44.560]   mophie station duo that I always carry with me I never had to take it out it was an almost a
[01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:51.600]   religious experience. Well the iPhone 6 seems to be outselling the 6 plus they they they they had
[01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:57.360]   enough electricity for only one night and yet the screen of the iPhone 6 plus burned for seven nights.
[01:16:57.360 --> 01:17:02.640]   I now let it once yeah never in two thousand years we're going to be telling this story to say
[01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:09.680]   the iPhone 6 outsold the iPhone 6 plus by three to one now apple's not saying this this is a
[01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:12.160]   report from consumer intelligence research partners.
[01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:18.800]   Credible we don't really know how the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 plus relative sales have been.
[01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:23.840]   Leger the team mobile said it was 50 50 but someone else said three to one as well so it's
[01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:29.680]   probably not far off. Yeah that means that merely that apple fans don't want to make that big jump
[01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:36.000]   from a four inch phone to a five and a half inch phone that's a big jump. It's also availability
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:40.000]   we don't know how many 6 plus says they sell if they get. I mean I know people who are still
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:43.520]   waiting who still haven't got from from launch day have still not got their phone off certain
[01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:48.720]   carrier right. And I know a lot of people that went to buy a 6 plus ended up buying a 6 because
[01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:54.000]   they just they want to walk away with the phone and the 6 plus wasn't available and and again I
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:58.480]   I'm looking back now I'm probably gonna go to the 6 I think the 6 makes a lot more sense. It's so
[01:17:58.480 --> 01:18:03.920]   elegant. I it could change when you start seeing a lot of apps take advantage of the extra real estate
[01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:09.440]   in the 6 plus. But right now everything's just big. I just need I feel like I need to either get
[01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:13.200]   another phone or get a whole new set of a whole new wardrobe because the 6 plus just doesn't fit
[01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:17.440]   like many of my pockets. I'm waiting for my. And Alex tactical pants is
[01:18:17.440 --> 01:18:25.680]   exactly. I was gonna send to Scott and email about me designing my own shirt you know so that it
[01:18:25.680 --> 01:18:31.760]   fits the 6 plus and it's got a whole thing and you know again again I say 5 1 1 technical.com
[01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:37.680]   get the tack like pro pants. I was I was on stage at the at the Mac Tech conference last week. I
[01:18:37.680 --> 01:18:43.200]   needed to have my pants free. So where did I put my iPad air to where back in the back pocket of my
[01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:52.560]   pants. It's easily and what I. All right. Where's the shot of that. Get your picks ready ladies and
[01:18:52.560 --> 01:19:00.000]   gentlemen because we are about to go to our picks. But first it's snack time and Andy I'm just gonna
[01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:06.480]   tempt you. So Lisa said some of these up to the up to our office to 205 to you know have a couple
[01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:11.120]   of them. And then now even like little rats we come down and grab a couple here. Oh now I know
[01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:17.760]   where our nature box is going. Those are so good. We really like it. Like I was like oh well we'll
[01:19:17.760 --> 01:19:23.520]   see we'll see how this turns out and they are so addicting. What is Andy asked what is in these big
[01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:27.840]   island pineapple rings that makes them so delicious. Well as everything with nature box
[01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:32.320]   nutritionist approved minimum ingredients no high fructose corn syrup no trans fats no
[01:19:32.320 --> 01:19:36.880]   artificial colors or flavors. In fact if you look at the ingredient list on big island pineapple
[01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:46.160]   rings what's inside pineapple. That's all. Mmm. So what is it that they do to these Andy they're
[01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:52.000]   so good. You know is is pineapple the trade name of some artificial sweet knives. They was from

[01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:39.680]   some to a party of last week of the week before and everyone was used to getting those old weird
[01:21:39.680 --> 01:21:43.920]   green or orange stuff that's been on convenience store shelves for years and I put this out and
[01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:50.880]   you could actually see the heavenly light in their eyes light up. Naturebox. Strawberry Greek yogurt
[01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:59.600]   pretzel's mango orange fruit juice. Mmm. All right. I'm clearly I had some transmission issues. It
[01:21:59.600 --> 01:22:03.040]   almost sound when you're talking about the packaging is almost as if you said something about an
[01:22:03.040 --> 01:22:10.720]   unused portion of it you can seal back in. I'm always very good. I have I will take one blueberry
[01:22:10.720 --> 01:22:18.080]   nom nom and I'll save the rest for later. I try. I go then I'll have maybe one more. I know.
[01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:24.160]   Yes. See I see I finished those pineapple slices before I finish my leftover Halloween candy. I know
[01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:32.080]   that was truly remarkable. I have to. It's a pretty good. Amazing. All right. Let's get to our
[01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:37.120]   picks of the week. Why don't you why don't you kick it off, Mr. Andy and not go. My choice is
[01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:44.400]   this really cool game called Space Age. That is let me activate crane cam 3000 the future of video
[01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:52.720]   podcasting here, which is. I will let me it's it's it's very familiar to people of a certain age
[01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:59.280]   because it's it's a lot like stupid. I was going to leave it that way. That's how we want it. It's
[01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:03.040]   upside down for you, but it's right. Set up for us. I wanted to put it right side up and then it's
[01:23:03.040 --> 01:23:06.800]   screwed up the other way, but now it's working fine. But yeah, it's it'll be very, very familiar to
[01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:12.080]   people who like grew up playing the Sierra online games because your basic eight bit move your guy
[01:23:12.080 --> 01:23:19.520]   around a place. But I can't remember another game I've ever played where I just did not play it for
[01:23:19.520 --> 01:23:23.360]   the first 10 minutes because I was just listening to the music and let me just I don't know if you
[01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:28.880]   can. We do hear it. It sounds good. And that's that's not even like the main triumphant theme
[01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:34.000]   theme song of it. It's just such beautiful music. It's actually written by cable sasser that you know
[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:40.080]   from the when we're talking about apps with great great user interfaces. So he's a developer, but
[01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:46.560]   now but he also is a really, really good, really, really nice composer and actually let me see if
[01:23:46.560 --> 01:23:53.680]   I can get into iTunes and but it's I guess I'll tap to continue so you can see some of what this
[01:23:53.680 --> 01:23:58.400]   actually does. So you actually are just like walking people through a terrain. It tells a story
[01:23:58.400 --> 01:24:03.520]   that's many, many chapters long. It's exactly the sort of game that I like because I don't like
[01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:08.240]   these fast twitch muscle sort of things. I don't like having to spend weeks and weeks learning how
[01:24:08.240 --> 01:24:12.960]   to use a digital sword and then mastering this new tool that I can then use nowhere else except
[01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:17.520]   for inside this one game. It's just pleasant. You can pause it. You can you can pick it up from
[01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:23.040]   elsewhere. And it's just such a pleasant experience start to finish. Another cool thing about it,
[01:24:23.040 --> 01:24:29.920]   I will say in passing is that in part of its setup options is that you can actually you can
[01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:36.560]   actually set it up so that if you have if you have a certain form of red color blindness or green
[01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:41.760]   color blindness, it will actually let you adjust the colors of the display so that you can actually
[01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:48.640]   use this a lot better. So it's I think it's a what is it about five bucks? Unfortunately, it's
[01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:54.720]   trying to find out but it's like it's I remember there's another one of those apps that that's
[01:24:54.720 --> 01:24:58.720]   free and thinking three ninety nine. There you go. Thank God. It's not free. Thanks. Thank God.
[01:24:58.720 --> 01:25:02.960]   It's not 99 cents. They're actually charging an amount of money that's realistic for the amount
[01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:09.600]   of work that they've done in this thing. And I'm the only thing stopping me from buying the soundtrack
[01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:16.640]   is just that I don't want to spoil. I don't want to I don't want to spoil the the ending of the
[01:25:16.640 --> 01:25:21.360]   of the story because there are spoilers inside the track listings. This is like the soundtrack to
[01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:27.280]   Star Wars Episode one all over again. So high recommendation. I'm only I'm only on chapter two,
[01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:31.680]   but every time every all the time I spend in here is just a really good fun time. I don't feel
[01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:35.440]   stupid for playing it either. That's all I ask when I play a game. I just don't want to feel
[01:25:35.440 --> 01:25:45.680]   stupid for playing this game. That's all. All right. Three ninety nine. And do you tap to make people
[01:25:45.680 --> 01:25:50.080]   move around? How does that work? Yeah, it is it is very much like a like a Sierra online game. You
[01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:54.640]   tap to move people around the landscape. You encounter other people you encounter new mysteries
[01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:58.480]   that again, I'm only on chapter two, but I'm guessing that you're gonna have to be you're gonna
[01:25:58.480 --> 01:26:04.960]   be called upon to solve as you make your way through the game. It's it's again, it's it's the
[01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:11.120]   story game that's really right up my alley. It's like it doesn't it's I play games to have a calming
[01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:18.000]   influence and a calming effect. I don't play games to say, okay back to work now.
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:23.040]   Mission accomplished. Thank you, Andy.
[01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:31.040]   Ladies and gentlemen, we move to Renee Richie from Montreal and I'm more.com for his pick of the day.
[01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:35.040]   I'm first going to just second Andy space is face ages terrific. Nevin Mergan and Matt
[01:26:35.040 --> 01:26:39.680]   Comey and that never is a designer of panic and it is I played it since the beta. It is just if
[01:26:39.680 --> 01:26:43.440]   you want a great time, just get that game and don't even think twice about it. It's utterly
[01:26:43.440 --> 01:26:48.640]   fantastic. Because I was going to actually pick space age because Andy got to the document before
[01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:53.840]   me. I hate it when that happened. But I was in luck because another great app launched right
[01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:59.280]   just before the show and it's called vellum and it's an ebook production app. You know,
[01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:05.040]   iBooks author is great, but it's iBooks only. It's it's iPad and Mac only. What vellum does is it
[01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:10.240]   wants to take all the heavy lifting out of you making books that are cross-platform. So for iBooks
[01:27:10.240 --> 01:27:15.040]   and for the Amazon Kindle and Trinity Caldwell who previously did all the books from Macworld
[01:27:15.040 --> 01:27:20.000]   and is now doing bunch of books for iMore, she took a look at it and she just loved, loved,
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:27.360]   loved it. And I can't think of a higher recommendation for an ebook app than that. It's in the Mac app
[01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:31.600]   for now. It's free to try. If you want to generate books, you have to pay them something, but it's
[01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:35.200]   one of those things where it's more than worthwhile, especially if you're going to make a lot of books
[01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:39.840]   to pony up for a license. It's on sale 50% off right now. I think you can get an unlimited license
[01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:45.600]   for $150, which is a steal when you see if you ever had a chance to watch Serenity Singleton talk
[01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:52.880]   where she explained the excruciating process of making cross-platform books. That that is money
[01:27:52.880 --> 01:27:58.080]   so well spent because this got her almost all the way there almost immediately. So if you're into
[01:27:58.080 --> 01:28:02.560]   making eBooks and if you want to have them on iBooks and you want to have them on Kindle,
[01:28:02.560 --> 01:28:05.600]   I can't recommend them enough. It's just the new version is just terrific.
[01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:13.040]   Mr. Alex Lindsey, your pick of the week. So for the tip on this one, I want to thank Aaron
[01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:18.240]   Ko who I think actually sent a couple of us the link and I bit. This is my next tip and I don't
[01:28:18.240 --> 01:28:21.040]   have it sitting in front of me because I didn't put it in my bag, but I was playing with it all
[01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:28.640]   for the last couple days is the shoulder pod. So the shoulder pod is this is a very solid
[01:28:28.640 --> 01:28:35.360]   mount for your for your iPhone and it does work with an iPhone 6 Plus, which I tested.
[01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:40.720]   So what it really does is it gives you a quarter 20 mounts. Of course, you can put it on a tripod.
[01:28:40.720 --> 01:28:44.800]   It's got a little handle, which at first I thought was really silly until I started playing with it
[01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:49.600]   and if you want to hold your phone and have kind of one handed operation with your thumb to start
[01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:54.400]   recording and stop recording or take photos, it actually works really well. But really one of the
[01:28:54.400 --> 01:29:00.800]   great things about it is it's got a slider to be put on a slider. Well, the big thing is is that
[01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:05.920]   it finally gives you a really solid. I mean, there's a lot of a lot of little mounts that I've
[01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:11.120]   that I've played with. I have, I think nearly every one of the mounts out there and ones that have
[01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:15.040]   cost more and less and everything else. But the problem is, is finding one that's really solid
[01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:19.600]   that you feel like is really going to, you know, you can you can attach to your phone and then really
[01:29:19.600 --> 01:29:25.200]   attach to a rig or attach to whatever you want to put it on has been very difficult from my perspective.
[01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:31.200]   So I haven't attached this one. I'm gonna my big test. Hopefully this week will be to
[01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:38.640]   put that on to a Ronin, which is kind of this steady cam kind of system. But the, but the main
[01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:41.920]   thing is having something is really solid that you really feel has grabbed onto your phone that's
[01:29:41.920 --> 01:29:46.560]   really stable, that isn't going to it's really going to stay exactly where you had it. When you
[01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:51.040]   put it onto your tripod, I think I haven't this is the first one that I found that I'm really
[01:29:51.040 --> 01:29:55.360]   comfortable with that doesn't like squeeze it in a weird way or or anything else. So I mean,
[01:29:55.360 --> 01:29:59.280]   there are some cases that you can put around it, but I don't, I think that I didn't really want to
[01:29:59.280 --> 01:30:04.480]   use the cases that kind of enclosed that I do a lot of other things with my phone. So having just
[01:30:04.480 --> 01:30:10.640]   amount that that that I can screw onto it, no matter what case it has on it, was something that I
[01:30:10.640 --> 01:30:15.920]   thought was very advantageous. And so anyway, so I'm pretty happy with it and relatively compared
[01:30:15.920 --> 01:30:21.120]   to a lot of these other cases at $35. It's a it's a pretty good deal. Yeah, it's only one 20th of
[01:30:21.120 --> 01:30:25.360]   an Alex. Yeah. And a lot of the ones that I've gotten have been a lot more than that and not
[01:30:25.360 --> 01:30:31.520]   been as as functional shoulder pod S one and it's not just for iPhone. It's got a adjustable grip.
[01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:37.680]   Yeah, you could barely put on I put I tried it with my M8 with my iPhone six s and of course,
[01:30:37.680 --> 01:30:45.360]   it's fine with a little five. So, so all of those ranges work fine with it and slide or not included.
[01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:51.680]   Yeah, that's a little bit more that's more than 35 dollars. That's all I'm saying. Alex, is there
[01:30:51.680 --> 01:30:57.680]   a fancy, fancy, fancy technical name for that track? For this for the slider? Yeah, it's called a
[01:30:57.680 --> 01:31:02.720]   slider actually. It's you can get a mechanical not to be confused with white castle sliders.
[01:31:02.720 --> 01:31:08.000]   It's a different. Yes, exactly. Yeah, it's not if you try to treat it like a white castle slider,
[01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:11.920]   you're not going to the hospital. Sorry, you know, but it's like, nor should you use a one
[01:31:11.920 --> 01:31:17.520]   castle slider with a slowly moving camera across a plain surface. Yeah, but there's a lot of
[01:31:17.520 --> 01:31:21.600]   different. A lot of companies that make them. I was kind of hoping it would be called like a
[01:31:21.600 --> 01:31:26.720]   Binyon rack track push. Yes, this is like a slide. Sliders are cool. In fact, we should probably
[01:31:26.720 --> 01:31:30.560]   get one. You know, what's one of the ones that I have in 2000, your video podcast, we have one.
[01:31:30.560 --> 01:31:37.760]   Oh, John says, yes, we should get one. How much are they just at a curiosity? It really ranges.
[01:31:37.760 --> 01:31:40.960]   You can get ones for as little as a couple hundred dollars that are manual and then you can get
[01:31:40.960 --> 01:31:46.080]   automatic ones that are more expensive. Yeah. One of the ones that we're looking at getting
[01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:50.480]   soon for some of the, you know, the round table show that we do is the Red Rocks,
[01:31:50.480 --> 01:31:54.400]   Red Rock Micro makes one that is kind of motorized and it just kind of goes back and forth really
[01:31:54.400 --> 01:31:57.840]   slowly. Yeah, that's what we want. Because then, yeah, and then you just switch to it and there's
[01:31:57.840 --> 01:32:03.040]   some movement, but it's not really, they had that at the iTunes festival. That's exactly what they
[01:32:03.040 --> 01:32:07.520]   were using. They had a long track in the ceiling and they would just, and then the camera just went
[01:32:07.520 --> 01:32:11.440]   back and forth all the time. And then they just switched to it every once in a while and you get
[01:32:11.440 --> 01:32:17.040]   this and it's moving very slowly, but perceptively. So you get this nice look. And so that I think
[01:32:17.040 --> 01:32:20.800]   Red Rock make and what they do is they have one that's a little, it's on a little bit of a curve
[01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:25.600]   track. So if you do it with a person, a subject, they stay and focus the whole time. So it doesn't
[01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:30.560]   change their, the, so we go around me at the whole, the whole time and just go. Yeah, of course.
[01:32:30.560 --> 01:32:35.520]   Yep. Absolutely. How much is that one? I was trying to, well, we're trying to get a Red Rock
[01:32:35.520 --> 01:32:42.960]   slider. I want one. There we go. I want one. It's called one man crew. The world's only
[01:32:42.960 --> 01:32:48.320]   motorized parabolic motion. Is that it? That's it.
[01:32:48.320 --> 01:32:55.680]   Let's, uh, okay. I won't 1500. I won't get an eye watch. Let's get that instead.
[01:32:55.680 --> 01:33:01.760]   Make it so, Mr. Slina, Jammerby is going to order this one right now. We just put it on the table
[01:33:01.760 --> 01:33:10.800]   here. All right. Actually, for my pick, I'm going to introduce Sam Downey who's here. Come on up,
[01:33:10.800 --> 01:33:17.120]   Sam. Just real quickly. Sam has comes every year for National Epelipsi Awareness Month. Actually,
[01:33:17.120 --> 01:33:23.600]   the big day was November 7th at, you went again to the, the Disneyland Resort, right? I did. Yes.
[01:33:23.600 --> 01:33:28.000]   How many people showed up for that? For this one, we had 4000 people. Wow. That's Sony. That's
[01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:32.400]   more than you had last year. Yeah. And it's, and you turned Disneyland to purple. That was the idea,
[01:33:32.400 --> 01:33:37.680]   because purple is the official color of epilepsy awareness. Yes. Yes. You could find out more,
[01:33:37.680 --> 01:33:44.000]   by the way, if you go to epilepsyawarenessday.org and, and Sam, you do this every year. That's
[01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:49.120]   so great. Every year. Uh, last year was the, the tester year. Oh, so this is the second year.
[01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:55.280]   The second year. Yeah. So, uh, this year we also had a, uh, had an expo, which was really fantastic.
[01:33:55.280 --> 01:34:00.800]   So people can meet surgeons and lots of non non protic charities as well.
[01:34:00.800 --> 01:34:09.760]   And when you think about epilepsy, it has, it affects more people than breast cancer in the world.
[01:34:09.760 --> 01:34:17.680]   And also more people than Parkinson's and dementia combined. And when you look at those,
[01:34:17.680 --> 01:34:26.000]   those figures, it's, it's immense. Uh, so I, I also have, I'm a, a tech guy as well. Uh, but I also
[01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:32.720]   have epilepsy myself. So that's kind of why I'm behind it. And, uh, it's a really good thing when
[01:34:32.720 --> 01:34:40.080]   you, when epilepsy affects families, um, doing an event at Disneyland is really fantastic because
[01:34:40.080 --> 01:34:44.000]   it brings families together. Sam, it's so great to see you. We were here last week. We did get
[01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:48.720]   it time to talk. I tried to finish the show in time so we could say hi. Where should people,
[01:34:48.720 --> 01:34:53.040]   if they want to find out more, if, uh, if they want to support epilepsy awareness,
[01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:56.960]   should they just go to epilepsy awareness data at org is that the best place? They, they, yeah,
[01:34:56.960 --> 01:35:04.160]   they certainly should. Uh, also on the website, there's a sponsors, uh, page and, uh, when you go
[01:35:04.160 --> 01:35:12.000]   to there, uh, for the supporters, uh, you'll get all the non-profits. Uh, and so if you want to,
[01:35:12.720 --> 01:35:17.280]   um, donate to any epilepsy charity, that's the best place to go at the moment.
[01:35:17.280 --> 01:35:22.560]   Excellent. Sam, it's great to see you. Thank you for the purple bear. I took the other one home. So
[01:35:22.560 --> 01:35:27.040]   you could, you could keep that one. I'm trying not all around the family.
[01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:31.200]   I really appreciate it. It's great to see you. A voice for epilepsy where he's,
[01:35:31.200 --> 01:35:34.720]   we're in a Sam Downey. Uh, he's on Twitter at @SamDowney.
[01:35:34.720 --> 01:35:36.480]   D-O-W-N-I-E. Correct.
[01:35:36.480 --> 01:35:39.040]   That's Sam Downey. And you're a podcaster too.
[01:35:39.040 --> 01:35:44.080]   I am. Yes. Well, in the UK, I work with the BBC as well.
[01:35:44.080 --> 01:35:48.080]   Okay, great. Uh, so I work with a tech program called Click. Click.
[01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:51.760]   And that's broadcast on BBC World Service. That's great. That's great.
[01:35:51.760 --> 01:35:56.720]   So I'm doing some features at the moment. All about tech startups in San Francisco.
[01:35:56.720 --> 01:36:00.000]   There are a few I hear. Thank you. Sam Downey.
[01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:05.680]   That's my pick. Epilepsy Awareness Day.org. Hey, I want to thank Andy and Aco for being here
[01:36:05.680 --> 01:36:11.280]   today from the Chicago Sun Times. Always great to have you. Always really appreciate it.
[01:36:11.280 --> 01:36:17.280]   Yeah. Really appreciate your, um, your insight and your openness to the idea that there may be
[01:36:17.280 --> 01:36:23.600]   something outside of the Apple world. I'll see you know, you're talking to a guy who's just now
[01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:28.160]   eating, who's now enthusiastic about eating fruit. Yeah. And your love fruit.
[01:36:28.160 --> 01:36:33.680]   That's the kind of show how open I am. And alien experiences. There you go.
[01:36:34.560 --> 01:36:38.720]   We want to thank Mr. Alex Lindsey for joining us from his studio in Pittsburgh,
[01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:44.880]   which I like the 50% gray behind you. I think that's a, that is a nice neutral color right behind you.
[01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:50.720]   Yeah, it's a good start. You know, I'm being me. We'll keep on changing, but this is where it's at
[01:36:50.720 --> 01:36:56.880]   right now. Awesome. And of course, Renee Richie, I'm more dot com. Great to have you on the show
[01:36:56.880 --> 01:37:01.680]   today. We're gonna, we're gonna, we're gonna solve this. We're gonna fix this, this issue. I think
[01:37:01.680 --> 01:37:04.400]   who's your, who's your ISP? Is it Rogers?
[01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:10.080]   Videotron. Oh, that's right. You're a mantra. I feel like it might be the ISP
[01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:15.520]   is inspecting the packets and saying, you know, we have a phone service ourselves. Maybe you
[01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:21.280]   shouldn't be using one of the other guys. I will call them in in rage later. Are you doing deep
[01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:28.000]   packet inspection, Videotron? Roger, Roger's did. Yes. Absolutely. So did Bell. Yeah.
[01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:33.440]   Have you ever tried like running through VPN and see what happens? I use a VPN most of the time,
[01:37:33.440 --> 01:37:36.880]   but I don't use it for these. We could try that because then they wouldn't be able to look at the
[01:37:36.880 --> 01:37:41.280]   packets and they might not, even though a VPN normally is slower and so it's not ideal for
[01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:46.480]   streaming video, it might, you might actually work better. And that would be a kind of a, of a,
[01:37:46.480 --> 01:37:50.640]   of a giveaway. I do other hangouts for an hour and a half though, and it doesn't affect them. So I'm
[01:37:50.640 --> 01:37:56.320]   not sure what's so strange. Yeah, I don't know. Maybe it's one of those peering agreements gone
[01:37:56.320 --> 01:38:01.840]   wrong in the Midwest or or it's a time of day thing. Yeah, it's I'm thinking it's got to be a time
[01:38:01.840 --> 01:38:06.160]   of day thing for the last three weeks that happens at about the same exact time. Yeah. Anyway, we're
[01:38:06.160 --> 01:38:10.320]   great, great that you hung in there through that. Thanks to Jason how for working with you
[01:38:10.320 --> 01:38:16.960]   behind the scenes as we talked. Yeah, he made it work better. He's a miracle worker. He's a miracle.
