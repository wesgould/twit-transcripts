[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.640]   and iOS world.
[00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.160]   And with us, as always, Andy and Naco from the Chicago Sun
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.560]   Times and the Celestial Waste of Ban with Ian,
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.320]   his brand new home.
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.640]   Yes, I've decided to ditch the country life
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.760]   and move to the big city.
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.280]   I should be dead by Wednesday.
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.520]   Where are you?
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.880]   Wait a minute.
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:38.560]   Don't let me touch it.
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.800]   It looks like a W.
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.200]   No, actually, it's one of those hotels
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.800]   that people put some books you in.
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.400]   And you're like, I don't recognize that brand name.
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.040]   OK, this could go either way.
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.440]   But it turns out to be a very, very lovely hotel
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.480]   in Midtown Manhattan with several stars.
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.680]   It's actually-- I can't show you around,
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.000]   but it is actually a suite.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.640]   It looks quite nice.
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.160]   Yes, I don't dare even look at the bucket of Pringles
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.520]   and other snacks because--
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.160]   $18 can of chips, and you're going to be sorry.
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.600]   So what brings you to the big apple?
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.960]   I'm giving a keynote at a conference
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.000]   at the Sloan Kettering Institute tomorrow.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.640]   Wow, prestigious.
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.280]   I'm going to teach them all about health care.
[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.360]   Now, maybe I'll just go over the tech side of things, maybe.
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.400]   Maybe.
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.480]   Alex Lindsay's tied up in San Francisco with other matters,
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.960]   but we have a very good replacement for him.
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.680]   A fellow who's been here before, Arnold Kim of MacRumors.com
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.840]   via his iPhone.
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:34.560]   Hi, Arnold.
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.000]   How are you?
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.600]   I'm doing well.
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.200]   You're telling me that the guy in charge of MacRumors
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.080]   doesn't have a MacBook with a camera in it?
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.560]   I do.
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.160]   It's not here.
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.280]   And my main computer is a Mac Pro with a 30-inch display,
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.440]   so it doesn't have a camera built in.
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.120]   Oh, OK.
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.960]   So that's my excuse.
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.720]   You know, those new 27-inches have a very nice eyesight.
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:58.400]   They do.
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.760]   They do.
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:59.800]   I guess I should upgrade.
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.680]   You like the big screen.
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.360]   I understand.
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.480]   I had a 30 for a long time, and I miss it.
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.920]   Arnold's editorial director at MacRumors.
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.960]   And you could actually be speaking to Sloan Kettering,
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.760]   because weren't you a physician by trade?
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.440]   Yes, I was a nephrologist, kidney doctor.
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.040]   Until I quit.
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.600]   You don't do that anymore?
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.080]   Nope.
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.080]   Because I got this terrible pain right down here
[00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.080]   in my head.
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.080]   No, I won't ask you any.
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.760]   No longer.
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.840]   I think my medical knowledge is declined precipitously
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:27.600]   over the last few years.
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.600]   Arnold, don't knock it.
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.400]   You know, kidneys really haven't changed much
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.480]   in the last million years.
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.120]   I think you're probably fine.
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.560]   I think you're good.
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.040]   That's right.
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.520]   I can just pick it back up.
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.160]   It's an interesting shift to say--
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.680]   I'm going to go from being a physician to--
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.800]   I'm going to run a Mac Rumorsight, a great Mac.
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.000]   I mean, the Mac Rumorsight.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.320]   Yeah, I mean, it was--
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.040]   there was a slow transition over the years.
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.400]   It wasn't-- I didn't start quitting, then started up.
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.920]   Came out of a love, I'm sure, for Apple and the Macitashes.
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:58.680]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.640]   I mean, certainly a personal interest.
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.080]   It's fueled at all.
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.760]   Did Apple ever give you a hard time
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.040]   about the word Mac in there?
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.520]   Surprisingly, they didn't.
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.520]   They've been pretty hardcore about the iPod and iPhone
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.160]   variants that people have been using.
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.400]   But I think the Mac ones have been around too long.
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.520]   And it might be--
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:19.400]   They might be-- it's kind of generic by now.
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.320]   27 years later, it's kind of--
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.240]   Yeah, they might be too late on that, actually.
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.320]   Yeah, go--
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.760]   because I want to rename this show to Mac Twit.
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:29.680]   Actually, it is Mac Break.
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.760]   I've never heard anything from Apple, so I guess we're all right.
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.920]   It's good we didn't call it iOS Break.
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:34.480]   Right.
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.000]   iPod Break, you'd have a problem.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.280]   We actually have iPad today.
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.000]   We haven't said anything about that show yet.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.520]   But maybe-- can you edit that out?
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.560]   Bleep.
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.800]   So top story, kind of an interesting story,
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.080]   straight ripped from the headlines.
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.120]   Apple is at a-- now, I don't really--
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.160]   I don't know how much stock price has to do with anything.
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.560]   But it is at an all-time stock price high.
[00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.480]   I closed yesterday $411.
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:01.920]   But this is the thing I find interesting.
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.960]   Up 10% since jobs stepped down.
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.880]   Is that counterintuitive?
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:09.440]   I wouldn't say so.
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.320]   I think I can never be shocked by what
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.080]   happens in the stock market because they're not
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.000]   really-- they're based on reality,
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.600]   but they're mostly based on gambling and fear.
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.600]   But really, the only thing that they will trade based
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.120]   on speculation, but once actual real numbers come by,
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.880]   everybody wisest up pretty fast.
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:30.360]   Also, I mean, a whole bunch of different competitors
[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.720]   and lined up competitors to Apple have been flaming out
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:33.960]   left and right.
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.080]   And I think this is a bunch of excitement
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.600]   going on about a new product release.
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.240]   And people wanting to buy in early before other people
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.480]   get in after the iPhone 4s or 5 comes out
[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.480]   and gets more attention for Apple and iCloud comes out
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.160]   getting even more attention for Apple.
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.760]   So I think this is kind of a self-feeding cycle.
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:53.840]   I take it back now.
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.520]   It's up another 2% today.
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.400]   It's now-- it was at just at $420.
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:58.400]   It's now $4.19.
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.040]   $0.66.
[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.680]   Still an all-time record high effect.
[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.680]   If you look at the graph, a big discontinuity
[00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:10.320]   starting this week, it's just jumped on Monday
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.200]   and then jumped again on Tuesday.
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.160]   Let me look at the one-month trend to see.
[00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.000]   Yeah, it's been just climbing like crazy.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.200]   You know, the old adage on the stock market
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:23.720]   is you buy on the rumor you sell on the news.
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.520]   I guess, Arnold, everybody-- the price already
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.320]   included Steve Jobs leaving.
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.760]   That wasn't such a surprise.
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:31.200]   Right.
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:32.880]   Well, yeah, it wasn't a surprise.
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.400]   It was probably a shock at the time,
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.200]   but everyone knew it was coming.
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.680]   So I think from that standpoint, it was priced into the stock.
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.920]   Otherwise, it's hard to find fault with Apple.
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.200]   They've been doing so well with the iPhone 4.
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.280]   And every day, there's a new report.
[00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:50.200]   iPhone 4 is the best selling smartphone, that sort of thing.
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:54.960]   So that said, I don't know how much leeway Apple will get
[00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.760]   if they have any mess ups in the future,
[00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:59.120]   because I feel like everyone's going to--
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.440]   Jobs not being there is going to be the go-to excuse
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:05.040]   or go-to blame, if that makes sense.
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.040]   Well, and then if it is true--
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:08.480]   if the adage is true, you buy on the rumor
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:11.400]   so on the news when they do announce the iPhone--
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.000]   next iPhone in the next few weeks.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.240]   Maybe you'll have a little sell-off.
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:16.440]   I wouldn't be surprised.
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:19.680]   It's ramping up now, as the rumors are ramping up
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.040]   about the iPhone 5.
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.640]   Now, what's-- I've been reading Mac rumors religiously
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:24.920]   over the last few days.
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.040]   This must be the heyday.
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:30.880]   This is like your election year or something.
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:33.680]   As the days build up to an Apple announcement, first,
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:38.440]   let me ask you, any date, do we know?
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:41.440]   I think everyone's looking at the first week of October,
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:44.040]   so fifth, sixth, seventh sort of dates.
[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:46.400]   Good, because I'm planning a vacation for the tenth.
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:47.960]   And we were trying to decide-- it's so funny.
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:51.920]   We were trying to decide, should I stay or should I go?
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.160]   And I said, oh, screw it.
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:56.960]   I'm not going to wait to figure out what Apple's going to do.
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:58.440]   So maybe I did the right thing.
[00:07:58.440 --> 00:07:59.000]   Pretty soon.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.920]   I mean, everyone's kind of on edge.
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:03.600]   From what we've heard, it does seem like a first week
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:06.160]   of October is probably-- if it hasn't been announced by then,
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:06.960]   it'll be announced then.
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:09.640]   If that's the case, we should hopefully see invites
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:10.920]   in the next week or so.
[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:15.400]   And the 23rd is we hear the day.
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:17.880]   That's three days from now, the end of this week,
[00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:21.720]   the day that the goal master for iOS 5 will be out, right?
[00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:23.640]   That's what everyone's saying.
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:25.120]   And it seems very likely.
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:28.640]   Apple is going to reset iCloud data on the 22nd.
[00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:29.800]   Perfect.
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:34.600]   And then I'm certain that the 23rd is planned for GM,
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:36.880]   whether it happens-- things can always change, I guess.
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:39.600]   But that's where we expect it to come.
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:41.920]   I mean, the GM probably see it to developers.
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:43.560]   The actual consumer release will probably
[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:46.160]   be alongside the announcement.
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:51.400]   TMO News-- and you have the Story of Mac rumors too--
[00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:56.200]   it has a screenshot of a newsletter sent to T-Mobile staff
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:02.120]   saying, quote, we are not going to get the iPhone 5 this year.
[00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:05.640]   However, rumors are strong that Sprint will get another
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.400]   iPhone in October.
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.920]   So T-Mobile will be the one left out.
[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:11.440]   Right.
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:11.940]   Right.
[00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:12.840]   That's what it seems like.
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:15.320]   I mean, this Sprint rumor had been floating around.
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.400]   But I think the Wall Street Journal is what-- who finally
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:20.040]   said, yes, it's going to happen for Sprint's years.
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:22.480]   Wall Street Journal obviously has a pipeline, right?
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:28.120]   They've got a direct line to the marketing--
[00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:30.000]   Chifo marketing at Apple.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.240]   And they just pick it up.
[00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:32.240]   Right.
[00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:32.740]   Yeah.
[00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:34.400]   And they say, OK.
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:37.720]   Because once it's in the journal, it's like, OK, it's going to happen.
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:38.080]   Right?
[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.800]   Have they missed any of these?
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:41.680]   You know, nothing big.
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:43.720]   I feel like definitely they are the ones
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:48.160]   that tend to get these last-minute scoops that help.
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:48.960]   Yeah.
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:51.920]   Yeah, you can argue that Apple pushing the rumors
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:53.080]   in that direction to try to--
[00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:54.760]   It's the cotton line.
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:55.720]   It's the key cotton.
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:56.720]   Hot line.
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:58.320]   D-d-d-d-d-d-d.
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:59.560]   Katie Cotton.
[00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:00.640]   Yes, you're right.
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:02.320]   Walt.
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:04.760]   We will be releasing an un- Sprint.
[00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:06.600]   I just feel like that there is a little--
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:09.720]   it must irk you a little bit, Arnold, because I mean, you got--
[00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:11.080]   No, I'm--
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:13.280]   No, actually, I don't mind it at all.
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:15.840]   It gives us something to talk about.
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:17.840]   That's true.
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:18.920]   That's true.
[00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:20.600]   So what do we know now?
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:22.400]   Or what do we-- we don't know anything.
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:27.400]   But what do we think now about-- so first week of October,
[00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.440]   for a while I was hearing two phones,
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:30.640]   then I was hearing one phone.
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:33.840]   Now, it seems as if the drum beat is two phones,
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:38.680]   a low cost, basically rehash of the iPhone for S.
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:41.680]   That's for international markets primarily,
[00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:43.720]   although will be available here.
[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:46.840]   Maybe that's what T-Mobile will get, I don't know.
[00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:51.320]   And then an actual iPhone 5, is that what you think Arnold?
[00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:52.520]   Is that what you're hearing?
[00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:55.120]   Then I'll ask you, Andy, I don't want to leave you out.
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:57.960]   Yeah, honestly, it's been very confusing this time around.
[00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:02.680]   I think there's-- so the iPhone 4S, which
[00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:06.000]   is what everyone's calling it, has there been--
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.600]   That's the cheap one.
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:08.800]   Well, maybe.
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:11.400]   I mean, there's been-- so everyone's-- so we've actually
[00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:12.400]   seen parts for it.
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:18.560]   So the screen, the frame, and even like various components
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:23.000]   to the device seem to have been leaking into the supply chain.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.520]   So if you put all those together, it looks like--
[00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:30.200]   it just looks like an iPhone 4, and may support--
[00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:35.200]   maybe a world phone, may support CDMA and GSM,
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:38.920]   which includes AT&T and Verizon.
[00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:41.120]   The weird part about it is it seems
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:43.760]   to have an A5 processor as well.
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:46.320]   So if you're going to call that the low cost iPhone,
[00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:48.480]   it's hard to say.
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:51.080]   So backing up a step, if you look at the most ambitious view
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:54.000]   of how these rumors fall out, and let's assume just
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.080]   that everything is true, then there's
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:58.240]   going to be this iPhone 5, which is actually
[00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:01.080]   a bigger device than the current iPhone 4.
[00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:04.560]   There'll be this iPhone 4S, which is what people are calling it.
[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:09.400]   And that will be a world phone, and also have an A5 processor,
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:13.000]   which is the faster processor that is in the iPad 2 right now.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.720]   And then there's this debate about whether or not
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:17.080]   that's going to be the cheap one.
[00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:20.640]   In some ways, it's possible that the existing iPhone 4
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:23.800]   will become the cheap one, just like the iPhone 3GS was
[00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:25.200]   the cheap one before.
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:28.480]   But that's a real ambitious view, where it's like,
[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:31.520]   you take everything and say everything's going to be true,
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:33.720]   then that's how it's going to fall out.
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:36.480]   It's like iPhone 4 might be the very cheap one.
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:39.440]   iPhone 4S will be a faster, but still
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:41.040]   retain the iPhone 4.
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:44.000]   A form factor, and then the 5 will be this bigger phone
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.680]   and also be faster, just like the iPad 2.
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:49.080]   And I don't know if that's going to happen,
[00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:53.080]   but those are all the rumors twirled together into one bowl
[00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:56.160]   and be like, well, that's everything falls.
[00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.240]   There's a few questions.
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:58.600]   Outliers.
[00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:00.200]   There's always been a few questions about that.
[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:01.120]   Yeah.
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:06.600]   Here's the-- from the Chinese Twitter site, waybo.com.
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:10.400]   Here's a picture of parts, including that A5 chip
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:17.800]   and a battery that's slightly higher power, 4.7 volts.
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:19.160]   And that would be 5.
[00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:19.520]   We don't know.
[00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:22.640]   JP Morgan's now saying there's the iPhone--
[00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:23.640]   what do they say?
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:29.920]   iPhone 4 plus and the iPhone 5.
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:32.760]   But Andy, what do you think?
[00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:34.840]   It's still really--
[00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:39.320]   $5 will get you any bet on any odds between what's going to happen.
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:42.680]   All I can say is that I'm still leaning towards one iPhone
[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:46.440]   and being an iPhone 4S sort of thing, like a component upgrade.
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:49.760]   Maybe a redesign of the body, but nothing shockingly new
[00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:52.160]   or shockingly big.
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:54.640]   I've seen lots of the sort of information
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:57.440]   you would tend to see that would support the iPhone 4S
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:58.280]   sort of thing.
[00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:02.000]   I haven't yet seen the sort of information that would indicate
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.720]   that an iPhone 5 is coming.
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:06.920]   But remember that that comes down to the idea of,
[00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:10.480]   do I know what anybody is talking about when anybody's
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:11.560]   talking about an iPhone 5?
[00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:13.440]   So my money's still on one iPhone,
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:16.080]   and it's not going to be big song and dance iPhone 5.
[00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:17.400]   It's going to be-- I believe it's going
[00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:19.920]   to be an incremental upgrade to the iPhone 4.
[00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:22.200]   These images are from Panda X tech.
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:28.360]   And now this one's a 3.7 volt, 5.3 watt hour battery, slightly--
[00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:32.520]   14, 30 milliamp hours of charge, which is 10 milliamp hours
[00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:34.160]   bigger than the iPhone 4.
[00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:38.120]   You do see the A5, though, clearly in there.
[00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:40.000]   This is funny, because even though it's disassembled,
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.200]   you see that it's asking to be hooked up to--
[00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:45.520]   Yeah, and that's interesting.
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:46.480]   There's something that--
[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.280]   I'm glad someone else raised this in the comments,
[00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:52.320]   because I'm thinking that, well, again, according to published
[00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:54.600]   reports I've read on Apple Insider, Mac, Rumors,
[00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:57.920]   and other kind of data available sites, exactly.
[00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:00.520]   The iOS 5, you don't even have to do anything to it
[00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:01.840]   when you take it out of the box.
[00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:03.400]   So I don't know.
[00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:06.080]   That doesn't necessarily mean that if this were a real engineering
[00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:08.680]   sample, that obviously they would put iOS 5 on it.
[00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:11.320]   Well, maybe they would just put iOS 4 just to test it out.
[00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:13.480]   That's simply what they're testing it with.
[00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:15.400]   But that's kind of an interesting data point.
[00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:19.480]   But again, it's just another excuse for us to talk, talk, talk,
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:21.480]   and wonder, wonder, wonder.
[00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:22.560]   I swear.
[00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:24.520]   It's just endless.
[00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:28.560]   Again, for weeks and weeks and weeks, it's always just time
[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:29.600]   and time again.
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:33.360]   And there was a sunny day in Dallas that day.
[00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:35.240]   But that guy standing at an umbrella,
[00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:38.120]   and he opened it just before the motorcade passed by.
[00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:38.640]   Why?
[00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:39.120]   Why?
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:41.000]   And it turns out just to be, well, maybe--
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.200]   Maybe he's stupid of his umbrella.
[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:46.840]   Sometimes an umbrella is just an umbrella.
[00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:51.560]   So yeah, like Andy said, there hasn't been a lot of evidence
[00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:52.720]   about the actual five.
[00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:55.440]   The only thing, the five that everyone's talking about,
[00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:58.400]   all that came from these case designs that were leaked
[00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:02.000]   early on, and that the Chinese manufacturers are ramping up
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.560]   these iPhone 5 cases.
[00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:10.240]   But besides that, there's been no leaked parts about that new case.
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:12.320]   It's a new case design.
[00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:13.440]   It's being a little bit funny.
[00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:16.640]   I got a picture from somebody who said,
[00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.560]   this looks like it could be the new iPhone 5.
[00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:19.920]   What do you think?
[00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:21.640]   And I look at it.
[00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:23.400]   I thought it was a joke, so I didn't reply.
[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:26.640]   And then he-- really, I'm waiting for-- what
[00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:27.760]   do you think this is really it?
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:29.360]   Because I think it's spot on.
[00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:33.240]   And then I had to say very tactfully saying, well,
[00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:36.320]   I'm a little bit skeptical that Apple would put a Nikon F
[00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:40.600]   mount interchangeable lens on the corner of it.
[00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:44.600]   Even if the iPhone is not this big, let's say that it scaled down,
[00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:46.400]   I don't think they're going to have an interchangeable lens
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:47.160]   system attached.
[00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:48.520]   Because it was literally-- this one
[00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:50.880]   had pasted in the distinctive ring
[00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:52.960]   mount of an SLR lens.
[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:56.160]   And what looked like a 50 millimeter F18.
[00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:56.680]   So I'm like--
[00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:57.200]   That's funny.
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:58.840]   I got to say no.
[00:16:58.840 --> 00:16:59.440]   I could be wrong.
[00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:01.240]   Hey, Apple surprised me before.
[00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:04.200]   But now here's an interesting data point.
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:10.560]   AT&T launched LTE in San Antonio, Chicago, Dallas,
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:16.280]   Houston, Atlanta on Sunday.
[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:21.200]   But I think it's-- we've all been pretty consistently
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:26.240]   presuming that there will not be a 4G iPhone this time around.
[00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:27.720]   But don't you think it's interesting?
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:29.880]   Somebody said, well, that confirms what I thought,
[00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:33.960]   which is that Apple deferred the iPhone 5 until LTE was available.
[00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:37.200]   So it could ship an LTE-based iPhone.
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:39.680]   Well, remember, we're all Apple people.
[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:41.960]   So we tend to think that the only phone that anybody
[00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:43.920]   is interested in selling is the iPhone.
[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:45.840]   There are these things called Android phones.
[00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:47.600]   And they work great.
[00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:50.760]   I've been carrying around a couple of different Android 4G
[00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:52.520]   phones and have a lot of fun with them.
[00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:54.760]   I think that at some point, AT&T has
[00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:56.400]   to start rolling out their 4G network.
[00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:59.240]   And this is just the first step in that network.
[00:17:59.240 --> 00:17:59.680]   That's my fact.
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:03.160]   I'm going to be in Chicago for a second conference
[00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:04.160]   later this week.
[00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:07.240]   And I'm meeting up with AT&T while I'm there.
[00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:09.120]   And they're going to give me some hardware.
[00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:12.080]   And before I huddle back to my little Puritan fishing
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:15.160]   colony where we don't deserve AT&T 4G,
[00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:18.160]   I'll open it, get some speed tests and stuff done.
[00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:21.520]   This just so people understand what we're talking about.
[00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:25.240]   AT&T has been up to now using something called HSPA
[00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:28.880]   Plus, which is really-- I don't think it qualifies as 4G.
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:30.440]   I don't think anybody in the US is actually
[00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:33.080]   doing anything that would be truly 4G.
[00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:36.320]   LTE is what Verizon-- it stands for long-term evolutions
[00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:37.720]   with Verizon's using for their 4G.
[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:40.520]   AT&T will be going 4G with LTE.
[00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:43.440]   Everybody will be LTE eventually.
[00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:46.280]   But right now, if you look at the map, it's four dots.
[00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:48.040]   It's 3% of the US.
[00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:49.720]   That's where you can get it.
[00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:54.200]   And on top of everything else, Verizon right now
[00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:58.160]   is to 4G what Apple is to the tablet market.
[00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:00.520]   If you really want 4G speed, you really
[00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:02.400]   have to go with Verizon because they
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:04.680]   have the largest network-- excuse me--
[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:08.280]   my experience of four or five, six different cities
[00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:11.240]   with usually a Verizon phone and some other makers
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:14.280]   phone side by side, not only does Verizon always
[00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:19.440]   have better coverage, but the speed increase available on Verizon
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:21.840]   is not subtle in the least.
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:24.760]   It's the difference between, hey, wow, that's faster than 3G
[00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:28.600]   and just, hey, wow, which is pretty much what Verizon will give
[00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:29.120]   you.
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:30.400]   But I do agree with you that I think
[00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:32.600]   that if there is a good--
[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:39.200]   amongst the good reasons for Apple, not G, and media
[00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:46.500]   phone is that this is the thing that will make
[00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:49.400]   between iPhone 4 and iPhone 5, the thing that will take people--
[00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:52.800]   that's keep to mirror and business, and I have an iPhone
[00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:53.400]   4.
[00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:55.160]   And I think that's one of the signal things
[00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:58.040]   they're going to be using for the iPhone 5 designation.
[00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:01.240]   We've seen people on Google+ and elsewhere on other social
[00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:03.760]   networks saying that AT&T has suddenly
[00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:06.960]   started offering them this and that.
[00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:09.080]   Somebody said the AT&T offered to convert me back
[00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:13.760]   to unlimited data and guessing that maybe this was AT&T worried
[00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:17.480]   that people would pick up the new iPhone at Verizon,
[00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:20.320]   hoping to get a better data network.
[00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:25.800]   But I still think that I think we all agree that--
[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:28.440]   well, let's ask Arnold, because you're the only one
[00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:29.240]   we haven't talked to.
[00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:30.920]   But over the last few weeks, I think we've all agreed
[00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:34.400]   that it seems unlikely that Apple would do a 4G iPhone
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:36.000]   this month, next month.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:36.360]   Right.
[00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:37.160]   No, I agree with that.
[00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:39.360]   I mean, I think all the signs have been--
[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:41.120]   all the analysts, all the predictions
[00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:43.600]   have been that LTE is too soon for this launch.
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:47.680]   So there's also someone pinpointed the exact Qualcomm
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:50.400]   chipset that they expect off the use, which I guess
[00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:53.720]   has a lower power profile than the current ones.
[00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:57.480]   And that's not due until the first half of 2012.
[00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:59.240]   So if you believe that, then it has to wait.
[00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:00.240]   That would make sense.
[00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:02.360]   Go with that chip.
[00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:04.160]   And Apple said during a conference call
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:07.040]   that they were compromised, as they
[00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:10.600]   were unwilling to make with the LTE chipsets, which everyone
[00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:13.600]   interpreted as power consumption.
[00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:15.560]   Well, I think the most important data point
[00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:18.480]   is that Instagram 2.0 came out today.
[00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:23.120]   And clearly, that means the new iPhone
[00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:25.320]   will be here any minute now.
[00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:27.320]   Yeah, you ever think that's so in Apple,
[00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:30.440]   like there are this team of engineers who just weeps
[00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:33.560]   every time an app like Instagram becomes a popular thing
[00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:36.840]   and say, we spent so much of our time.
[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:38.880]   I missed my baby's first steps because we were
[00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:41.680]   engineering the best camera phone ever.
[00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:44.320]   And you want to just use this cheap app that makes it look
[00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:46.080]   like a 1973 baller.
[00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:50.040]   And that was pretty you, which is to grab you.
[00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:52.200]   I never thought of it quite that way, but you're right.
[00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:54.640]   I have to say, though, that Instagram is--
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:55.800]   I would bet.
[00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:57.720]   I think I saw stats, but I don't remember.
[00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:00.880]   But I would bet Instagram is like the number one way
[00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:03.640]   iPhone pictures are shared these days.
[00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:06.280]   Huge number of people use Instagram.
[00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:11.160]   Now they're going to go to a higher resolution, which is good.
[00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:15.400]   Still won't be 8 megapixels if there is indeed an 8 megapixel
[00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:17.960]   camera in the next iPhone.
[00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:20.760]   Anyway, I hope I didn't steal anybody's pick of the week
[00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:21.600]   with that one.
[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:24.120]   We've got Arnold Kim here from MacRumors, MacRumors.com.
[00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:25.040]   Andy Enoco is here.
[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:26.360]   He's in a hotel in New York City.
[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:29.520]   And his Skype has been working so great until just a second ago.
[00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:32.120]   So Andy, we're going to hang up on you and call you right back
[00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:34.000]   while I do a go-to-meeting commercial.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.120]   How about that?
[00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:36.480]   How about that?
[00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:38.120]   What about them apples?
[00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:39.880]   I'm only sorry I'm going to miss the commercial.
[00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:42.200]   Yeah, I'm sorry too.
[00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:44.000]   But you're not going to miss the commercial.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:44.600]   Go to meeting.
[00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:47.080]   It is absolutely the best way to do meetings online.
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:48.840]   We do so many meetings now.
[00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:51.120]   Meetings are the bane of any business existence, right?
[00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:53.760]   And unfortunately, it's about the only way
[00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:54.960]   you can get teams working together.
[00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:56.680]   It's how you make sales.
[00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:58.000]   It's how you train people.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.120]   You've got to have face-to-face meetings.
[00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:02.200]   But nowadays, with teams spread out all over the country,
[00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:03.280]   all over the world.
[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:04.640]   Sometimes those face-to-face meetings
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:06.400]   happen on the phone on conference calls.
[00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:07.400]   Ick.
[00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:07.760]   Ick.
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:09.480]   That's why we've used Go-to-Meeting for so long.
[00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:10.880]   Because Go-to-Meeting at least allows
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:17.240]   you to add screen sharing so you can see the PowerPoint
[00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:18.560]   of the keynote presentation.
[00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:20.280]   Well, now they've added HD faces.
[00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:23.720]   And I have to say, this makes Go-to-Meeting the way to meet.
[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:25.800]   Even if I'm going to have a meeting with staff
[00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:27.720]   in the same town, I'm going to say,
[00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:29.360]   let's use Go-to-Meeting.
[00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:33.000]   Go-to-Meeting has added high-definition video
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.920]   to their screen sharing.
[00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:36.000]   It's incredible.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.960]   You can have up to six people in the meeting, see their video.
[00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:40.600]   Everybody these days has a webcam.
[00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:41.560]   Except for Arnold.
[00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:43.760]   Everybody has a webcam these days.
[00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:47.360]   And I'll tell you, with the kind of bandwidth
[00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:48.840]   that you have nowadays in most places,
[00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:52.920]   you're really getting high-def crystal clear video.
[00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:54.800]   The audio is built in.
[00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:58.000]   So it's a conference call that over voip these days.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.360]   You still have a screen sharing.
[00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:03.360]   It is just a spectacular way to streamline communication
[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:04.880]   and improve productivity.
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:06.720]   You can schedule meetings in advance.
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:07.520]   That's what we usually do.
[00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:08.200]   We send out an email.
[00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:09.280]   It makes it very easy for everybody.
[00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:10.480]   But you can also do it on the fly.
[00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:14.040]   By the way, your attendees do not have to have it installed.
[00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:14.680]   It's a click.
[00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:17.640]   And 30 seconds later, it's running on their system.
[00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:18.600]   I love that.
[00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:20.080]   No IT support necessary.
[00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:21.920]   You don't need to have--
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:23.000]   it uses NAT traversals.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   So you don't need to punch holes in firewalls or anything
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:25.480]   like that.
[00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:28.640]   It really is very, very slick.

[00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:51.920]   to try this.
[00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:52.800]   Show them the video.
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:54.240]   I think they'll be blown away.
[00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:56.360]   I could not believe how good it was.
[00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:58.040]   It really, it's incredible.
[00:24:58.040 --> 00:24:59.920]   We should actually do the shows this way.
[00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:03.920]   Go to meeting.com.
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:06.160]   Use the offer code MACBreak.
[00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:08.720]   I think you will love it.
[00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:10.600]   Andy Naco is here from the Chicago Sun Times
[00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:12.560]   and the celestial waste of bandwidth.
[00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:13.840]   If you stopped wasting your bandwidth,
[00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:16.040]   maybe your Skype would work.
[00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:17.880]   We call him back.
[00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:18.720]   He sounds good.
[00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:20.360]   And I--
[00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:20.880]   Thank you.
[00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:24.400]   I think we'll just call you back every 10 minutes.
[00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:25.080]   Fine by me.
[00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:30.600]   American Customer Service Satisfaction Index.
[00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:32.560]   If you can't imagine what that measures.
[00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:34.320]   It measures satisfaction.
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:38.160]   Apple number one, once again, in satisfaction,
[00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:41.000]   a poll of 70,000 consumers.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.840]   Apple kind of clobbered everybody else.
[00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:50.040]   There's Apple with 87% customer satisfaction.
[00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:52.320]   That's kind of stunning.
[00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:54.840]   Hewlett Packard was 78.
[00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:56.840]   Baseline, whatever that is, is 78.
[00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:59.360]   Acer is 77.
[00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:02.560]   They rolled Lenovo, Sony, and Toshiba into all others.
[00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:03.080]   I don't know why.
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:05.400]   Dell down there at 77.
[00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:07.200]   But here's another-- this is actually--
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:10.240]   this is from Harry McCracken's Technologizer blog.
[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:11.880]   This I like.
[00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:13.080]   This red line is Apple.
[00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:15.280]   Look at the customer satisfaction.
[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:17.720]   Dove a little bit in '97, '98.
[00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:22.000]   Steve Jobs comes back, starts climbing, starts climbing.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.040]   And just they just-- if this were a horse race,
[00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:27.000]   they'd have run away with it.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:27.600]   Look at that.
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:30.320]   Just stunning.
[00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:31.680]   So not a surprise.
[00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:37.720]   I think everybody-- in preparation for the iPhone 5,
[00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:41.360]   I took my daughter's broken iPhone 3GS, which I had in a drawer.
[00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:44.560]   And my son's broken and dipped in a swimming pool,
[00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:47.320]   iPhone 4, which I had in a drawer.
[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:49.400]   And I brought it into this company that
[00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:51.600]   does iPhone repair up the road a bit.
[00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:53.160]   We've actually had them in.
[00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:55.480]   They took apart the iPad when it came out.
[00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:56.840]   They're really amazing.
[00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:57.360]   Half an hour.
[00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:58.360]   They go, bzz, bzz, bzz.
[00:26:58.360 --> 00:26:59.200]   They got all the parts.
[00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:02.280]   She's blow dry, bzz, scraped out the corrosion, bzz, bzz, bzz.
[00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:04.600]   And the whole thing's back together and working
[00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:06.360]   for like $100 each.
[00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:08.080]   Then somebody told me that Apple-- and I
[00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:09.840]   would like to get the confirmation of this--
[00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:13.000]   Apple, if you bring in a broken iPhone,
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.760]   we'll just give you a new one for $200.
[00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:15.440]   No questions asked.
[00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:17.520]   Is that true?
[00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:18.560]   I think that's true.
[00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:19.960]   Yeah.
[00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:20.800]   Really?
[00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:21.800]   Sometimes you can burn.
[00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:22.800]   Sometimes you can burn.
[00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:23.800]   Sometimes you can burn back.
[00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:26.560]   They don't charge you the full $600.
[00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:27.440]   Nope.
[00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:29.880]   And as a matter of fact, I also advise people
[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:33.800]   that if you have had an accident with your iPhone
[00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:36.680]   or any of your mobile devices, it is worth--
[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:39.160]   and you know that it's totally your fault.
[00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:41.400]   You put it through the wash or you dropped it down some stairs
[00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:42.200]   or whatever.
[00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:44.960]   It's totally worth it to go to the Genius Bar, tell them
[00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:46.480]   what happened and see if they can do anything more.
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:47.600]   And be honest.
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:48.480]   Yeah.
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:50.560]   Absolutely be honest because they can figure--
[00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:52.560]   they see millions and millions of these phones.
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:55.840]   They know that-- they know that a phone with a crack screen
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:58.160]   on both sides and lots of scrapes on the edges
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:27:59.720]   did not just stop working.
[00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:01.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:04.240]   But there is-- I spent a long time
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:07.000]   talking to Genius Bar people to find out
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.520]   what a lot of the policies were.
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:11.480]   And time and time again, I came across this phrase
[00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:15.720]   called the "We're Awesome" policy, which is sometimes,
[00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:18.600]   if you feel as though this guy tried to take care of his phone,
[00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:20.040]   he just got unlucky.
[00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:23.320]   We happened to be doing kind of OK with spares on hand.
[00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:26.800]   So just to prove how awesome we are, we're going to--
[00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:28.960]   and this person was honest with us,
[00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:30.560]   just to show how awesome we are, we're just
[00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:32.120]   going to swap him out a new phone.
[00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:33.440]   That's not something you can count on
[00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:35.320]   because they will explain to you that this is not
[00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:36.000]   within warranty.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.600]   We have no obligation to do this.
[00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:39.600]   We're just saying, you know what, I think he just got unlucky
[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:41.240]   and we want to make sure that you're happy with your purchase.
[00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:42.480]   So congratulations.
[00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:44.680]   We will swap you out a new one.
[00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:46.840]   That's especially true in the first couple of weeks
[00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:50.200]   after a new iPad or a new iPhone has been released.
[00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:51.560]   Yeah.
[00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:54.400]   That chairman was confirming that this is the case,
[00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:57.160]   and that it is a refurb, not a new, but it's as good as new.
[00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:59.800]   I mean, it's a refurb iPhone.
[00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:01.760]   And will they just do that again and again and again
[00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:03.080]   for $200?
[00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:05.960]   I know occasionally you get it for free.
[00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:08.520]   That's pretty amazing.
[00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:10.160]   I don't know if there's a limit to that.
[00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:13.720]   But the other thing is if you crack the back of your iPhone,
[00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:17.440]   like the back class, they'll replace that for $29.
[00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:18.720]   Really?
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:20.360]   Yeah, I had to get that done.
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:23.680]   Well, it's easy because the thing is glass and it's slippery.
[00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:25.120]   So it does break down.
[00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:26.640]   It's kind of a bad guy.
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:27.720]   And I try to get my--
[00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:29.320]   Ooh, what happened there?
[00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:31.280]   Looks like you dipped it in tar.
[00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:34.000]   Well, that's Gaffra's tape to basically hold the glass
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.240]   back together.
[00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:36.360]   I got--
[00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:38.080]   I got-- that was one of the classics.
[00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:39.480]   It's in my shirt pocket.
[00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:43.520]   I got home from a job or something.
[00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:45.400]   Had to bend down, pick up a package,
[00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:46.520]   and boom, down on the concrete.
[00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:47.160]   It went.
[00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:49.160]   So this is just a negative reinforcement
[00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:51.760]   to remind myself to be more careful with my toys.
[00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:54.000]   So here's the picture of the broken phones.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.640]   The one on the left is the iPhone 4.
[00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:58.000]   It's broken on the back as well.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.840]   And took a dip in the swimming pool.
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:02.200]   By the way, the folks at iPhone, urgent care.
[00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:04.080]   As soon as you open it, he said, oh, you got it wet too.
[00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:04.720]   I said, what?
[00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:05.880]   He said, let's see this strip here.
[00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:07.680]   It turns blue when it's wet.
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:09.960]   So that's why Apple knows.
[00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:12.200]   And then I was kind of impressive.
[00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:14.120]   They replaced both front and back.
[00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:17.200]   I had to get them replaced some other stuff.
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:19.680]   And they fixed it, so I was very pleased.
[00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:23.240]   But a little did I know I could get a completely new one,
[00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:26.360]   practically new one for $200.
[00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:27.360]   So good on Apple.
[00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:30.120]   No wonder they've got such high customer satisfaction.
[00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:31.960]   That's the kind of thing that makes a big difference.
[00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:34.480]   And the kind of thing that nobody else I don't think is doing.
[00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:35.480]   Yeah.
[00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:37.800]   And I think the thing that kind of leaps out at you with all the
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:41.400]   copies on that list is that Apple is the only company that not
[00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:44.240]   only does their own service, but does it face to face.
[00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:46.160]   They don't just send you to a depot and they don't tell you
[00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:50.120]   that, well, there's this thing called the Geek Squad at Best Buy.
[00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:54.720]   And if you have $300, they'll be happy to get the porn off your computer
[00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:59.040]   and then tell you that you need a system update and sell you another $30 cable.
[00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:04.240]   E-Carda Shinsky says, hey, mine's dropped twice on the sidewalk without a scratch.
[00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:06.320]   I must be dropping it wrong.
[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:08.960]   So I have not broken mine.
[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:10.880]   I have not broken mine, not once.
[00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:11.880]   Any phone.
[00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:17.440]   But these are my kids who have clearly different standards for how things
[00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:19.440]   drop.
[00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:21.160]   According to Mac Roemer's, great site.
[00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:22.160]   Love that.
[00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:25.920]   Arnold Kim writing, "Apple's working on allowing the merging of multiple Apple
[00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:26.920]   IDs.
[00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:27.920]   This has been kind of painful.
[00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:32.280]   I have a couple of Apple IDs and one I can't even log into anymore.
[00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:35.640]   I changed the password and immediately says, no, you've tried too many times.
[00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:36.640]   It's just broken.
[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:37.640]   I got to call them."
[00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:39.680]   But it would be nice to merve all of these.
[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:41.720]   They're not doing it yet, are they?
[00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:42.920]   No, no.
[00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:48.120]   So it's interesting because Tim Cook's really, I don't know, really responsive with his
[00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:49.120]   emails.
[00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:52.720]   So people have been emailing him ever since he became official CEO.
[00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:57.960]   And there's been a lot of reports of, oh, you know, I mean, he gets a lot of one word,
[00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:03.160]   you know, thanks replies, but then other times he seems to forward issues on to the
[00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:05.560]   right people and then they get in touch with the customers.
[00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:07.120]   And these are pretty nicely done.
[00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:08.120]   Look, he says, hi, Sheldon.
[00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:09.880]   One way, but that's from Eddie.
[00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:10.880]   Who's Eddie?
[00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:11.880]   Eddie Q.
[00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:12.880]   He's a...
[00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:13.880]   Ah, Eddie Q.
[00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:15.880]   Internet services for Apple.
[00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:18.480]   So he's responding too.
[00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:19.480]   That's very cool.
[00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:20.480]   Yeah.
[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:23.880]   So I think Cook triages his emails or someone does.
[00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:24.880]   Forward it over.
[00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:25.880]   Yeah.
[00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:29.720]   I'm sure he has the office of the president or office of the CEO who's going through all
[00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:30.720]   of that stuff.
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:31.720]   Sure.
[00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:34.920]   But the, yeah, the mobile me one, two people actually got the same response.
[00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:40.760]   They actually got a phone call about it saying, yes, we understand that this is an issue where
[00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:44.880]   you have multiple IDs and you can't, you can't, and you want to merge them.
[00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:45.880]   Right.
[00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:48.120]   I'm sorry, we don't, we can't do it right now, but I've talked to, you know, whoever is
[00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:50.520]   responsible for that and they've said they're working on it.
[00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:52.440]   So, you know, look forward to it.
[00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:53.440]   Right.
[00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:56.680]   And it's, it's clearly going to be a big problem, especially with iCloud.
[00:32:56.680 --> 00:33:00.200]   Even with automatic downloads, it's, it's, it's an issue.
[00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:02.200]   I don't know if you've tried using the automatic downloads.
[00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:03.200]   I have, but it's great.
[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:04.200]   But it's perfect.
[00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:09.680]   If you have more than one account, they lock, they lock you for 90 days and you can't switch
[00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:10.680]   it again.
[00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:12.160]   So you kind of have to commit.
[00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:14.920]   Oh, I didn't know that was going to happen.
[00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:15.920]   Yeah.
[00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:16.920]   So pick your account.
[00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:17.920]   Yeah.
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:18.920]   Right.
[00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:20.160]   90 days.
[00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:21.760]   That's on the phone.
[00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:24.440]   That's on the phone and the computer, I think.
[00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:25.440]   Mm.
[00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:26.440]   All right.
[00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:27.440]   Well, this is good to know.
[00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:28.600]   I didn't, I didn't expect that.
[00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:29.600]   All right.
[00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:30.600]   Also, go ahead.
[00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:33.480]   That's saying it really is a mess.
[00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:38.480]   As a matter of fact, it's in some ways, I wish that we could sort of split the accounts
[00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:44.160]   because I'm starting to get a little bit concerned about the number of, the number of
[00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:47.840]   different ways my Mac experience could be totally screwed up.
[00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:55.880]   If somebody knows what my iCloud or Mac address is and what that one password is, that one
[00:33:55.880 --> 00:34:01.200]   password used to just control, hey, I'm just going to sync a few things and I'm going to
[00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:03.080]   buy some things off the iTunes store.
[00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:07.320]   But now it's the key to every transaction you ever do with Apple.
[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:11.880]   And I've kind of had to change it from like the sort of simple one to the complicated
[00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:14.320]   one that's a little bit harder to remember.
[00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:18.760]   And now it's all the way down to the one that I need a mnemonic device to remember exactly
[00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:23.600]   what this password is because I'm a little bit creeped up by the idea of one password
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:29.320]   that gives people access to a lot of my financial stuff, ability to buy things on the Apple
[00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:31.000]   store and elsewhere.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:36.040]   And I'm sorry, not on the Apple store, but you know, the online stores and also, excuse
[00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:38.400]   me, digital downloads.
[00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:42.000]   I don't mean that people could buy things otherwise.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:48.680]   And also access to iCloud syncing, all based on one password that is so easy to just because
[00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:51.680]   you blow through that first screen when you get your new machine and you might choose,
[00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:54.640]   you know, donuts.
[00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:56.560]   And then you forget about it because it's being auto-filled.
[00:34:56.560 --> 00:35:01.200]   And now you've got this really weak password that could really be the key to a lot of mayhem.
[00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:02.200]   Yeah.
[00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:06.160]   And I hear from a lot of people who have, oh, my account was hacked.
[00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:11.360]   It's very, you know, these are people called a radio show and they have lots of stories
[00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:13.120]   about this kind of stuff.
[00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:15.600]   And it's because they picked donuts.
[00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:17.080]   Absolutely.
[00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:23.560]   Samsung is, according to Mac rumors, Samsung is making plans to target.
[00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:27.800]   Actually, this comes originally from the Korea Times to target the iPhone 5 with patent
[00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:30.840]   lawsuits the minute it comes out.
[00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:32.880]   Now they can't do it until it comes out.
[00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:37.320]   And of course, Apple's been sewing Samsung trying to stop its products, barring, for
[00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:44.160]   instance, the Galaxy tab from sales in Germany and trying to do the same in Australia.
[00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:51.000]   As soon as the iPhone 5 comes out, according to the Korea Times, unnamed officials from
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:58.120]   Samsung say they're going to go right after it, including NFC, if an NFC is built in.
[00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:02.720]   Google just announced yesterday it's Google Wallet using this NFC in your field communications
[00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:03.720]   chip.
[00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:06.960]   But it's only in one phone, only in one carrier.
[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:10.920]   It's the Galaxy S on the Sprint.
[00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:13.200]   And that's it.
[00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:14.200]   So are the Nexus S?
[00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:15.200]   Is the Nexus S?
[00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:16.200]   Nexus S?
[00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:17.200]   Yeah.
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:18.200]   Nexus S 4G.
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:19.320]   So you have to have that one phone.
[00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:24.800]   But then if you have that phone and you're in San Francisco, New York and you're on Sprint
[00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:29.920]   and you're at a merchant that takes it, then you can use your phone to pay.
[00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:31.880]   Wow.
[00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:32.880]   But it's early.
[00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:33.880]   It's early days.
[00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:35.200]   You have to have MasterCard too.
[00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:37.080]   You could charge it up with any card though, right?
[00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:39.080]   But there is a special card that'll work with it.
[00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:43.000]   Who's the MasterCard in Visa and American Express and all of that is coming.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.800]   That magic voice, by the way, I know you're looking and you're saying, "Where's the woman?"
[00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:50.560]   That is Zilene Rivera, who is not only the producer of this show and running in the
[00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:53.720]   board office for this show, but she's also the host of All About Android, so she knows
[00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:54.720]   a little bit about this.
[00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:56.360]   Yeah, we talked about it last night.
[00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:57.600]   Yeah, they already did.
[00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:00.240]   That's all I'd say they're all over it.
[00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:03.720]   Will Apple release a white iPod touch?
[00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:04.720]   We haven't...
[00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:07.960]   Everybody talks about this October event as if it's an iPhone event, but it's usually
[00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:09.440]   an iPod event, Arnold.
[00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:12.760]   Do we know anything about iPod releases for next month?
[00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:16.800]   Yeah, so I think what's going to happen, and it's a little bit of a disappointment,
[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:21.160]   I guess, is that there will be a white iPod touch and...
[00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:22.160]   That's nice.
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:27.800]   It sounds like still the black iPod touch and not much different.
[00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:32.320]   I think a lot of people were hoping that there would be a major upgrade to the iPod
[00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:37.880]   touch as well as the iPhone, but from what we heard, it sounds like it may...
[00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:43.360]   The white iPod touch may be really it in terms of the iPod line as to what they're changing.
[00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:45.320]   So I don't even know if it's going to get...
[00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:48.040]   Doesn't even sound like it's going to get an A5 processor.
[00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:49.040]   Wow.
[00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:50.040]   It needs a better camera.
[00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:52.400]   I wouldn't worry about anything but a better camera.
[00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:54.040]   If it would just have a better camera.
[00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:55.040]   Right, right.
[00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:58.800]   There was a lot of people who were very unhappy with the iPod touch camera when it came out.
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:01.640]   Because it's like a... I don't remember the rest of it.
[00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:02.640]   It's like one megapixel.
[00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:04.640]   Yeah, it's the worst.
[00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:05.640]   It is.
[00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:08.400]   It's literally a megapixel.
[00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:11.200]   And it could be so good.
[00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:13.840]   I think Apple's probably smart because I think people are actually...
[00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:18.200]   I believe they're actually buying the iPhone for the camera.
[00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:20.760]   That's how good that camera is on the iPhone.
[00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:23.000]   Yeah, there's also been a lot of talk about...
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:28.720]   And again, I think as Apple gets more popular, the rumors get sort of insane because everyone
[00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:31.160]   sort of throws in their two cents or...
[00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:34.920]   But here, anything little thing, it sort of becomes a rumor.
[00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:42.600]   So one discussion point was, is Apple going to make the iPhone so cheap?
[00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:45.120]   The iPhone 4, I guess, presumably the low end iPhone.
[00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:50.880]   So cheap that the iPod touch is not as appealing or it will not be as appealing.
[00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:55.160]   Because if you have a low end iPhone that costs the same, let's say, off contract as
[00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:58.680]   an iPod touch, then why wouldn't you buy the iPhone?
[00:38:58.680 --> 00:39:04.360]   And I guess the only other reason is the iPod touch is thinner if that matters to you.
[00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:05.360]   Hmm.
[00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:06.360]   Hmm.
[00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:08.360]   That makes sense.
[00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:09.360]   Yeah.
[00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:10.360]   And I know...
[00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:11.720]   I know Groobber had...
[00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:17.920]   John Groobber had argued that an Apple's best interest is if they can pump up their iPhone
[00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:21.320]   numbers because no one seems to count the iPod touch for anything in terms of all these
[00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:23.040]   market share numbers.
[00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:27.240]   People say, "Oh, there's so and so many Android phones or so and so many iPhones."
[00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:31.880]   But the iPod touch is sort of neglected from those calculations.
[00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:34.960]   But does Apple really ever cared about market share numbers?
[00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:37.640]   They care more about profitability.
[00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:39.560]   Profit numbers, that's what they care about.
[00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:43.240]   Also, the thing that I've always found interesting that surprised me a little bit about the iPod
[00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:44.960]   touch because I kind of...
[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:49.160]   It's not very much on my radar, but then people explained to me who have kids that they like
[00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:53.560]   to buy their kids iPod touches because it's kind of like giving them an iPhone without
[00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:59.120]   all the things that would make the parents worry about the kid having an iPhone.
[00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:04.080]   If you take out the internet everywhere and the phone features and you say, "Well, if
[00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:10.120]   you really do want to send naughty messages to your friends at school, you are going to
[00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:13.440]   have to be in a public library or a McDonald's or a Starbucks to make that happen."
[00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:14.440]   Well, and there's a market.
[00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:17.800]   I think there's a fairly large market, maybe not huge from Apple's point of view, of people
[00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:24.600]   who want a PDA still and they don't want to have to spend 90 bucks a month on data plans.
[00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:28.480]   They just want to Wi-Fi PDA and the iPod touch is really a great choice for them.
[00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:30.200]   They get all the apps.
[00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:31.200]   They get...
[00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:33.600]   You know, you could basically do everything you could do with an iPhone except make calls
[00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:39.120]   and maybe they already have a feature phone or whatever, but they just want to do it.
[00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:40.560]   I think this is a good app.
[00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:42.680]   The app store is now warning you.
[00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:47.120]   There's been a problem with forking on the app store where, in fact, I have a number of
[00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:49.560]   applications that I've repurchased.
[00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:54.280]   I bought online originally on the website of the company and then bought it on the app
[00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:57.960]   store just so I wouldn't have to keep track of where I got it and the updates would be
[00:40:57.960 --> 00:40:58.960]   built in.
[00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:03.000]   But that's a problem, of course, because you may have already paid for it and then if
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.200]   you get it from the app store, you're going to have to buy it again.
[00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:08.320]   So now they're putting up a warning.
[00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:12.120]   It's saying Program X is already installed and was not purchased from the app store.
[00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:15.120]   Do you want to buy it again?
[00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:18.400]   Unfortunately, it doesn't get triggered all the time.
[00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:21.240]   The apps have to be exactly the same version.
[00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:23.840]   So you still have to be a little careful when you're installing from the app store.
[00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:27.240]   Try to remember where you got it, kids.
[00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:29.640]   That's why I just I pay for it again.
[00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:32.200]   Yeah, I mean, just just yesterday.
[00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:33.200]   It's frustrating.
[00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:38.440]   But also because I think this points to the reasons why Apple is trying to keep app prices
[00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:47.280]   low because if someone has the choice between buying into the app store or having to find
[00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:51.920]   their installed DVDs all over again, oftentimes you're going to say, okay, you know what, keynote
[00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:54.160]   is just $19.99.
[00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:57.960]   I'll buy it through the app store and that way I will never have to look for that DVD
[00:41:57.960 --> 00:41:58.960]   ever again.
[00:41:58.960 --> 00:41:59.960]   I'll never have to authenticate ever again.
[00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:03.000]   And all the updates will be a lot easier to pull off.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   That's what I did yesterday.
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:06.160]   Yeah, that's what I do.
[00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:10.040]   Speaking of updates from the app store, here's a really big one.
[00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:16.040]   One we've been waiting for here at the old Twit Brickhouse Final Cut Pro 10.0.1.
[00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:21.040]   But don't be fooled by that version number, which makes it sound like a minor update.
[00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:23.040]   It's pretty significant.
[00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:27.960]   For instance, they now have an XML format that can be imported and exported for other
[00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:30.160]   programs to read.
[00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:36.440]   And for us, a huge thing, it supports X-SAN, which did not before.
[00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:41.960]   Now I'm hoping it'll support non-Apple SANs because that's how we do our editing.
[00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:47.600]   We actually were looking at changing to Premiere because the new version of Final Cut Pro
[00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:53.680]   10 does not support saving and editing from a SAN drive.
[00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:56.960]   So I'm hoping that maybe this will work.
[00:42:56.960 --> 00:42:57.960]   We don't know yet.
[00:42:57.960 --> 00:43:01.200]   It's a big, big update, even though it's only 10.0.1.
[00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:03.640]   It's going to make a huge difference to us.
[00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:05.880]   And it might keep us an Apple shop.
[00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:07.960]   I'm not promising.
[00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:11.600]   Full screen of you in OS 10 Lion is now enabled.
[00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:15.560]   Can't believe it wasn't.
[00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:19.080]   I'm not a Final Cut expert, so I'm not sure what else is important in here.
[00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:22.280]   Speed up delivery with GPU accelerated export.
[00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:25.080]   That sounds like something we'd need.
[00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:28.480]   Your audio and video stems as a single multi-track, quick-time movie.
[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:29.480]   Whatever.
[00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:35.000]   At least it's free, right?
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:39.680]   It does point to people think that Apple is a supremely arrogant company that doesn't
[00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:41.200]   really pay attention.
[00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:43.480]   And they're at least partly right.
[00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:45.880]   But they look at the numbers as much as anybody else.
[00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:51.160]   And if they see that it's the decision that they made just is not going down with anybody,
[00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:53.400]   that's when you start to see a reversal or a modification.
[00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:56.280]   That's when they start to never be a press release.
[00:43:56.280 --> 00:44:01.200]   I suppose the long differences that Apple TV was the one time when they said, "Okay."
[00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:02.200]   We screwed up.
[00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:06.000]   Just a hobby, but it was a hobby in which we did not have any idea why people would want
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   a device like this.
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.080]   "Okay, please try it again."
[00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:12.600]   But this is more typical to what they do where they'll say, "You know what?
[00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:15.680]   Maybe it is okay to have the old version of Final Cut available.
[00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:20.680]   And if you really do feel so badly about it that I saw you having that green takeout
[00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:22.920]   to lunch by that nice rep from Adobe.
[00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:26.640]   Why don't we just slip a few features that we initially thought were not going to be
[00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:32.160]   important or more likely it's more likely this a feature that was fought long and hard
[00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:34.440]   about inside in that office.
[00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:38.080]   One side one, one side lost and the losing side said, "Yep, yes, see?
[00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:39.080]   Yes, see?
[00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:41.560]   That's why I threw that cup of water in your face.
[00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:47.000]   Not because I'm a mean guy, but because I didn't think you were listening."
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:51.600]   Let us take a break when we come back.
[00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:53.280]   We will have more to talk about.
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:55.560]   We also have our picks of the week coming up.
[00:44:55.560 --> 00:45:00.160]   Arnold Kim is here and I have some emails to Macbreak@twit.tv, by the way.
[00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:02.160]   That's our new address Macbreak@twit.tv.
[00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:03.160]   Some emails have come in.
[00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:04.160]   Arnold Kim is here.
[00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:06.200]   He is the editor in chief of Mac.
[00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:08.200]   Actually, that's not the title you give yourself, is it?
[00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:10.560]   It's editor, editorial director of Macbreak.
[00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:13.440]   Yes, Eric is editor in chief.
[00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:15.360]   He's more than day to day.
[00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:19.560]   You just sit there and enjoy the fruits of your labor, literally.
[00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:24.440]   Actually, I really want to talk about this Intel Ivy Bridge story because it's something
[00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:25.360]   near and dear to my heart.
[00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:27.200]   We will do that in just a second.
[00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:28.200]   Thank you for being here, Arnold.
[00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:29.200]   It's great.
[00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:31.800]   Alex Lindsay, I have some fun assignment today.
[00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:37.240]   Andy Inaco also here from New York, New York, where he's about to speak to the Sloan Kettering
[00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:44.400]   Institute about cancer treatment in oncological affairs because many people don't know that,
[00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:47.000]   but that's his real expertise.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.800]   It's eye-dabble.
[00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:53.000]   You always have the dream about turning your hobby into a career.
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:56.200]   Well, I think I'm just this close to it.
[00:45:56.200 --> 00:46:00.000]   Dr. Mom says, "Hey, that's my talk."
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:01.200]   He's told it from you, Dr. Mom.
[00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:02.520]   He told it from the best.
[00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:05.200]   Before we go much farther, I want to tell you about gazelle.com.
[00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:06.960]   There is a new, I am convinced.
[00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:11.840]   I don't have any crystal ball, but I am convinced there is a new iPhone coming.
[00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:13.520]   There are new iPods coming.
[00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:16.120]   Some even say there are new iPads coming.
[00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:21.520]   When the time has come to buy a new gadget, please rid yourself of the old gadget.
[00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:24.920]   You don't want to be like me with a drawer, a closet, and an entire ... Actually, I have
[00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:25.920]   a friend.
[00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:33.920]   His name is John C. Devorak, who rents an entire office above a gas station to store his old
[00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:34.920]   gadgets.
[00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:36.920]   He just throws them in there.
[00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:37.920]   I'll never forget.
[00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:40.800]   It was in the early days of doing the radio show with him in 1991.
[00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:41.800]   I said, "John, I need a modem."
[00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:44.660]   He said, "Well, come over into the gas station."
[00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:46.440]   He opens the door like Fiverr McGee's closet.
[00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:48.280]   The gadgets are starting to come out.
[00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:49.280]   He goes in there.
[00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:50.480]   There's a modem in there.
[00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:51.480]   I go in there.
[00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:52.480]   There's like five different modems.
[00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:53.480]   I pick one.
[00:46:53.480 --> 00:46:54.480]   I come out.
[00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:56.200]   "Push the door shut."
[00:46:56.200 --> 00:46:57.800]   Don't let that happen to you.
[00:46:57.800 --> 00:46:59.520]   Get paid for your gadgets.
[00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:05.280]   $25 million worth of gadgets have been paid for bought by gazelle.
[00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:06.840]   This is such a great way to do it too.
[00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:07.840]   Your data is safe.
[00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:10.760]   When they get your gadget, they will wipe it for you with their personal data.
[00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:17.560]   They recycle gadgets that aren't worth anything in green.
[00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:20.960]   Recyclers that never send it off shore and never put it in landfills.
[00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:24.000]   All you have to do is go to gazelle.com.
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:25.800]   Type in the gadgets you've got to get rid of.
[00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:31.480]   A smartphone and MP3 player e-book reader, laptop, camera, gaming console, GPS device
[00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:32.480]   video game.
[00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:39.080]   I'm going to keep this Apple 3GS, iPhone 3GS because I like it.
[00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:40.080]   It's kind of a backup.
[00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:41.080]   I'm just curious.
[00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:43.920]   It's a 3GS 16 gigabyte.
[00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:46.240]   Now, man, no noticeable flaws.
[00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:47.240]   It's brand new.
[00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:48.240]   I replaced it.
[00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:49.240]   There's no AC.
[00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:50.240]   I'll say it.
[00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:51.240]   Yes, actually there is.
[00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:52.240]   There's that little plug in there.
[00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:54.440]   I have that free from water damage.
[00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:55.840]   Yes, it is.
[00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:57.800]   That's not the one that went in the swing pool.
[00:47:57.800 --> 00:47:59.520]   Look at that.
[00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:01.360]   Look at that.
[00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:03.160]   That pays for the new iPhone practically.
[00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:04.680]   Here's the deal.
[00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:06.200]   Now I've got the offer.
[00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:08.120]   I can add it to the box.
[00:48:08.120 --> 00:48:09.120]   It's kind of cool.
[00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:13.920]   I'll just throw it in a box, any box, a shipping box, obviously.
[00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:16.160]   I can continue to go through gadgets.
[00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:17.160]   Just add them that quickly.
[00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:18.840]   See how easy it is?
[00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:23.160]   Then when it's time to check out, they'll give me a print out a mailing label for me.
[00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:25.080]   They pay all the postage.
[00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:26.640]   Actually they email it to you.
[00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:30.640]   They also email you updates as the process goes.
[00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:33.160]   Exactly what's going on.
[00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:38.360]   When you get paid, and you can get paid in a variety of ways, Amazon cards, in fact if
[00:48:38.360 --> 00:48:44.840]   you use a Walmart or Amazon gift card, you get a 5% bonus on the value of your gadget.
[00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:48.400]   Walmart gift cards PayPal, check.
[00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:49.400]   Or and I love this.
[00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:53.600]   You can ask Azelle to donate the value of your gadget to charity.
[00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:57.360]   iPads between $227 and $304.
[00:48:57.360 --> 00:49:01.360]   Kindles, Nooks and other e-book readers going for $28 to $66.
[00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:06.840]   And iPhone 3 and 3GS, as you just saw, $100 to $177 MacBooks.
[00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:09.720]   Up to $265 for a MacBook Core 2 Duo.
[00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:11.760]   Can you believe that?
[00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:15.640]   Gazelle at my friends, G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.
[00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:17.160]   Keep it moving as they're slogan.
[00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:19.080]   Pay it forward.
[00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:25.040]   Don't let those gadgets that unsightly gadget mess build up in your home.
[00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:26.040]   Don't sell it.
[00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:28.800]   Gazelle at G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.com.
[00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:32.840]   We use it all the time actually and it's really been a boon for us.
[00:49:32.840 --> 00:49:34.680]   I just love it.
[00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:42.440]   So this story just out and I'm really excited about this on MacRumors.com.
[00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:43.440]   Ivy Bridge.
[00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:49.120]   Intel's, you know, it's sad because last week was Apple's, I mean Microsoft's big build
[00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:51.720]   conference and all the attention going to Windows 8.
[00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:55.840]   Intel unfortunately scheduled their developers form exactly the same week.
[00:49:55.840 --> 00:49:57.320]   So they didn't get as much ink.
[00:49:57.320 --> 00:50:01.280]   It's too bad because this is pretty exciting and these are the chips that will be in the
[00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:03.160]   next generation Macintosh's by the way.
[00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:08.080]   The Ivy Bridge processors will support 4K HD video.
[00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:11.240]   That's four times higher resolution than HD.
[00:50:11.240 --> 00:50:16.440]   4096 by 4096 pixels.
[00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:18.120]   That's pretty exciting.
[00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:24.120]   If you've ever seen a 4K video, it's like looking through a window.
[00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:26.000]   It's amazing.
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:29.320]   I presume that this is the kind of thing that Apple will jump on.
[00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:34.320]   In fact, Lion has already has 4K support built into it apparently.
[00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:38.960]   What do you think they're targeting?
[00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:40.600]   I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:46.320]   Oh no, I mean, there's been a lot of, I mean, you know, it's been of interest to me too because
[00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:49.240]   there's been a lot of talk about, you know, once Apple introduced a retina display for
[00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:53.200]   the iPhone, it was like, oh, I can't wait till, you know, and then, you know, you kind of,
[00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:55.520]   when you first hear about it, you think, oh, how much better could it be?
[00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:56.520]   And then you actually use it.
[00:50:56.520 --> 00:50:57.520]   Wow.
[00:50:57.520 --> 00:50:58.520]   It's like, wow.
[00:50:58.520 --> 00:50:59.520]   Right.
[00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:02.160]   So everyone's like, how can we get, you know, when we can get like desktop displays?
[00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:06.200]   Because honestly, desktop displays have been kind of stagnant for the last few years.
[00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:08.560]   I mean, I've had the 30 inch for a while.
[00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:12.760]   I don't think you can get much better than this, right?
[00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:13.760]   It's amazing.
[00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:16.240]   It would be amazing to have 4th.
[00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:18.480]   How big is the resolution on the 30?
[00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:20.880]   2560 by 1600.
[00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:27.840]   Okay, so it's actually not that high resolution compared to this 4096 by 4096.
[00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:29.760]   Obviously, you'd have to get a new display.
[00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:33.600]   Yeah, yeah, no, I'm saying, but yeah, you think, but the DPI's, I guess, haven't been
[00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:35.320]   increasing over the years that much.
[00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:36.320]   No, right.
[00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:39.520]   And a lot of that's due to software issues, you know, with Mac OS 10.
[00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:40.520]   Well, yeah.
[00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:41.520]   You can shrink down.
[00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:45.520]   When we first started doing Mac break video that that insane Alex Lindsey put it out
[00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:48.600]   as 1080p video, and you couldn't play it back.
[00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:50.160]   And this was only a couple of years ago.
[00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:51.160]   It would just stutter.
[00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:58.120]   I mean, if you were lucky enough to have a 1080 screen, you just couldn't play it back.
[00:51:58.120 --> 00:51:59.560]   So I think this is a big improvement.
[00:51:59.560 --> 00:52:05.080]   Now, people are pointing out that it's not 16, nine, and that's true.
[00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:09.200]   And I'm not sure exactly what that's all about, but that's what the Intel slides is
[00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:13.120]   4096 by 4096, which is square.
[00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:18.400]   Yeah, I think they just mean they can push that many pixels, whatever, whatever shape
[00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:19.400]   it comes in.
[00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:20.400]   I get it.
[00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:21.400]   It's still 4k.
[00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:22.400]   Yeah.
[00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:23.400]   And I mean, the big advantage.
[00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:27.600]   And presumably there's third party graphics parts that already sport 4k video, but I guess
[00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:32.880]   the key here is that this is going into the MacBook Air, the next MacBook Air, the Ivy
[00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:38.200]   Bridge chips, and they don't have enough room to put or enough, I guess, heat expenditure.
[00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:41.800]   They have the heat allowance to put in a third party GPU.
[00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:43.720]   So they got these.
[00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:49.960]   So the trick here is, or the subtle point here is that presumably the next MacBook Air could
[00:52:49.960 --> 00:52:52.800]   support these resolution screens.
[00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:57.560]   Well, if you have a Mac Pro, you can put in whatever video, well, whatever.
[00:52:57.560 --> 00:53:01.440]   You can put in a 500 dollar video card and get whatever you want.
[00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:03.840]   There's enough cooling in there and so forth.
[00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:04.840]   Right.
[00:53:04.840 --> 00:53:07.640]   But this one will actually be available through like down to the low end.
[00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:08.640]   In a laptop.
[00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:10.120]   Right, to the MacBook Airline.
[00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:16.720]   Well, you're going to be really glad now that you have that, which Macaw it port.
[00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:17.720]   Underbolt.
[00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:18.720]   Thunderbolt.
[00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:19.720]   Yeah.
[00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:23.160]   No, what you're going to call it because then you go out to that big display from your
[00:53:23.160 --> 00:53:24.160]   little computer.
[00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:26.560]   I don't know when they come up with a new hit, come a doodle based.
[00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:30.560]   That's going to be, which you can wait another year.
[00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:33.480]   But, but, but, but, but I'm reading about this though.
[00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:37.800]   I'm trying to figure out exactly what, how that would translate into a direct feature
[00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:43.160]   that I think that Apple be really, really happy if they didn't ship a single Mac that
[00:53:43.160 --> 00:53:48.720]   didn't support really good full 1080i or 1080 or 720 video.
[00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:54.440]   But is there really a need for retina level 30 inch display?
[00:53:54.440 --> 00:53:58.400]   Because a 30 inch display, you're going to have that at least 18 inches away from you.
[00:53:58.400 --> 00:53:59.400]   Right.
[00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:01.920]   And at that point, are you going to really appreciate that kind of dot pitch?
[00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:05.840]   Or is this the sort of thing where they're just saying that if this is a feature, this
[00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:09.760]   is going to be a feature in every one of the, every one of the Macs that we have that have
[00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:11.640]   the pros that pro designation.
[00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:15.200]   Although we appreciate that only people who are having a Mac Pro might be doing this sort
[00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:18.080]   of work where they might want to actually see 4K video.
[00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:19.080]   Wow.
[00:54:19.080 --> 00:54:20.520]   So it's, it's a, it's a cool chip feature.
[00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:22.480]   It can only translate to cool things.
[00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:26.960]   Uh, like, like the release says, it seems, it seems to be a free feature that you get
[00:54:26.960 --> 00:54:31.840]   with every one of these chips as opposed to, well, we'll, we'll add another $350 bonus
[00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:37.000]   SKU to the product line to give it a special 4K video equipped Macs.
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:40.880]   But I think we can't be quite so literal in thinking about how this is going to translate
[00:54:40.880 --> 00:54:41.880]   to a new Mac.
[00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:46.840]   Well, I think the, the dream though is the, is not a high DPI 30 inch screen so much
[00:54:46.840 --> 00:54:51.920]   is your 11 inch Mac book with twice the dots per inch.
[00:54:51.920 --> 00:55:00.360]   So a really high density laptop display, which whatever the, I mean, you know, I think that's
[00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:04.840]   what, uh, that's what I've been sort of, you know, with all these developments that's
[00:55:04.840 --> 00:55:09.040]   been sort of in my mind is when are we going to get a Mac book pro that you can buy that
[00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:13.720]   isn't 1440 by 900 and it's 2880 by 1800.
[00:55:13.720 --> 00:55:18.360]   And then suddenly everything is that much sharper or smaller.
[00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:19.360]   Yeah.
[00:55:19.360 --> 00:55:23.760]   I mean, getting a higher, higher resolution, I think is a natural, but when you, I think
[00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:28.440]   it will stop way, way short of fully exploiting what that chip kind of chip can do because
[00:55:28.440 --> 00:55:32.040]   great now we have hardware that can support that kind of screen density.
[00:55:32.040 --> 00:55:36.760]   How much is it going to cost to have any sort of a mobile screen that can support that kind
[00:55:36.760 --> 00:55:40.720]   of, that kind of resolution and how, and not only that, but when it comes time to actually
[00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:44.960]   build these sort of things, how many duds are they going to, is the, is the fact we're
[00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:46.960]   going to produce for every one usable one.
[00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:50.840]   I mean, it's okay if you're doing like cut rate laptops where you're going to say, you
[00:55:50.840 --> 00:55:53.400]   know what half the screen is kind of purple.
[00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:57.880]   The other screen is a little bit plaid, but you know what, what do people want for $1,200
[00:55:57.880 --> 00:55:58.880]   in the market?
[00:55:58.880 --> 00:55:59.880]   I mean, I think it's a little bit more expensive.
[00:55:59.880 --> 00:56:00.880]   I mean, I think it's a little bit more expensive.
[00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:01.880]   I mean, I think it's a little bit more expensive.
[00:56:01.880 --> 00:56:02.880]   I mean, I think it's a little bit more expensive.
[00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:03.880]   I mean, I think it's a little bit more expensive.
[00:56:03.880 --> 00:56:04.880]   I mean, I think it's a little bit more expensive.
[00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:05.880]   I mean, I think it's a little bit more expensive.
[00:56:05.880 --> 00:56:06.880]   I mean, I think it's a little bit more expensive.
[00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:07.880]   I mean, I think it's a little bit more expensive.
[00:56:07.880 --> 00:56:08.880]   I mean, I think it's a little bit more expensive.
[00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:09.880]   I mean, I think it's a little bit more expensive.
[00:56:09.880 --> 00:56:10.880]   I mean, I think it's a little bit more expensive.
[00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:11.880]   I mean, I think it's a little bit more expensive.
[00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:12.880]   I mean, I think it's a little bit more expensive.
[00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:31.880]   I mean, I think it's a little bit more expensive.
[00:56:31.880 --> 00:56:51.880]   I think it's a little bit more expensive.
[00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:58.880]   I think it's a little bit more expensive.
[00:56:58.880 --> 00:57:05.880]   I think it's a little bit more expensive.
[00:57:05.880 --> 00:57:12.880]   I think it's a little bit more expensive.
[00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:19.880]   I think it's a little bit more expensive.
[00:57:19.880 --> 00:57:26.880]   I think it's a little bit more expensive.
[00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:33.880]   I think it's a little bit more expensive.
[00:57:33.880 --> 00:57:40.880]   I think it's a little bit more expensive.
[00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:47.880]   I think it's a little bit more expensive.
[00:57:47.880 --> 00:57:54.880]   I think it's a little bit more expensive.
[00:57:54.880 --> 00:57:57.880]   I think it's a little bit more expensive.
[00:57:57.880 --> 00:58:02.880]   I think it's a little bit more expensive.
[00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:07.880]   I think it's a little bit more expensive.
[00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:14.880]   I think it's a little bit more expensive.
[00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:21.880]   I think it's a little bit more expensive.
[00:58:21.880 --> 00:58:28.880]   I think it's a little bit more expensive.
[00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:35.880]   I think it's a little bit more expensive.
[00:58:35.880 --> 00:58:42.880]   I think it's a little bit more expensive.
[00:58:42.880 --> 00:58:49.880]   I think it's a little bit more expensive.
[00:58:49.880 --> 00:58:56.880]   I think it's a little bit more expensive.
[00:58:56.880 --> 00:59:03.880]   I think it's a little bit more expensive.
[00:59:03.880 --> 00:59:10.880]   I think it's a little bit more expensive.
[00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:17.880]   I think it's a little bit more expensive.
[00:59:17.880 --> 00:59:24.880]   I think it's a little bit more expensive.
[00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:31.880]   I think it's a little bit more expensive.
[00:59:31.880 --> 00:59:38.880]   I think it's a little bit more expensive.
[00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:43.880]   Scully talking about, of course, he was at PepsiCo when Steve Jobs very famously wooed
[00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:49.360]   him to come to Apple in 1983 saying you can continue selling sugar water to kids or you
[00:59:49.360 --> 00:59:51.880]   can come with me and change the world.
[00:59:51.880 --> 00:59:55.880]   Scully did and he changed Apple firing Steve Jobs shortly after.
[00:59:55.880 --> 00:59:58.880]   It's interesting.
[00:59:58.880 --> 01:00:00.880]   Boys, I highly recommend this interview.
[01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:06.880]   Scully has some regrets about how Steve was treated.
[01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:13.880]   He says the way it went is that the board decided to remove Jobs from the Macintosh project.
[01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:15.880]   The project he had shepherded to bring.
[01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:19.880]   This was just before Macintosh came out, I believe.
[01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:21.880]   To remove him from that, it was such a blow.
[01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:23.880]   They did keep him on as chairman of the board.
[01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:29.880]   It was such a blow to Steve that six months later he just quit outright.
[01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:35.880]   Interestingly, Scully has not spoken to Jobs ever since.
[01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:38.880]   He says this is John Scully talking.
[01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:41.880]   It's still a very painful story because we were not just business colleagues.
[01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:42.880]   We were good friends.
[01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:45.880]   We spent a tremendous amount of time together.
[01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:51.880]   I think the separation was driven by Steve being in a real funk because the Macintosh,
[01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:55.880]   which he developed was failing in early 1985.
[01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:56.880]   I'd had forgotten this.
[01:00:56.880 --> 01:00:57.880]   His vision was ahead of its time.
[01:00:57.880 --> 01:01:04.880]   The power of the microprocessor, that 68,000, I think it was a one megahertz 68,000 in there,
[01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:06.880]   wasn't enough to do what he wanted to do.
[01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:09.880]   And Mac sales were falling off.
[01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:10.880]   The board made a decision.
[01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:13.880]   They asked Steve to step down as the head of the Mac division.
[01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:17.880]   He will still remain as chairman of the board, but that was an incredible blow to the man
[01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:18.880]   who created the product.
[01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:21.880]   He was extremely hurt and pained by it.
[01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:23.880]   Scully says he came from corporate America.
[01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:27.880]   He was used to this kind of stuff, but he says that's not what you do with the founders of companies.
[01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:29.880]   Steve and I had a legitimate difference of opinion.
[01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:33.880]   Scully wanted to keep the cash cow that was the apple to going.
[01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:36.880]   Jobs really wanted to move the company toward the Mac.
[01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:41.880]   He says the emotional blow of the board asking him to step down from his role, leading the Mac division
[01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:43.880]   was incredibly hurtful to him.
[01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:46.880]   I didn't realize how painful that had to have been.
[01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:51.880]   He says Steve went off in sabbatical some months later, came back, resigned from the company,
[01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:55.880]   took five executives with him, started next.
[01:01:55.880 --> 01:02:00.880]   He says that's, I appreciate more today that apple was never just a business to Steve.
[01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:05.880]   Apple is Steve Jobs and Steve Jobs is apple.
[01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:09.880]   That was entirely different from anything I experienced coming out of Pepsi.
[01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:14.880]   So that has gone on for 25 years and we have not had contact.
[01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:20.880]   He said in the past, I've tried to reach out to jobs and he never had any interest in reengaging.
[01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:21.880]   He clearly blames me.
[01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:26.880]   And then the final thing he says, which is kind of, it's kind of a might have been.
[01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:29.880]   He says, I wish Steve and I hadn't had a falling out.
[01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:32.880]   I wish I had gone back to Steve and said, this is your company.
[01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:35.880]   Let's figure out how you can come back and be CEO.
[01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:37.880]   I wish I had thought of that, but you can't change history.
[01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:39.880]   Imagine what apple would be.
[01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:44.880]   If that had happened, if Jobs had stayed on board, of course he came back.
[01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:45.880]   What was it?
[01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:52.880]   He left an 85, came back in 97, so it came back 12 years later to a company that was falling apart
[01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:54.880]   and turned it around completely.
[01:02:54.880 --> 01:03:00.880]   It's hard to imagine how different it would be because remember that the operating system
[01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:06.880]   that we're all running right now is essentially Next Step, which wouldn't have existed had he not started a brand new company
[01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:10.880]   with a handful of people who were really very much free to do whatever they wanted,
[01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:13.880]   any operating system they wanted.
[01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:21.880]   I think we all remember what it was like, all the different strategies that apple had for next generation operating system
[01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:30.880]   that just blue boxes and pink boxes and red boxes and different kinds of composers that used as code names
[01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:35.880]   without any sort of coherent strategy as to what was going to ship and what any of the goals were.
[01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:48.880]   It's also interesting, given that all of modern Mac history has been about apple being not only led by Steve Jobs
[01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:53.880]   but led in a very hands-on, no-nonsense fashion by Steve Jobs.
[01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:58.880]   It's hard to remember a time when he actually was not the top person on the org chart
[01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:03.880]   and there was a time when it was possible for him to be forced out by anybody.
[01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:04.880]   You make a really good point.
[01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:05.880]   I think that you're right.
[01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:07.880]   I think Steve had to wander in the wilderness.
[01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:09.880]   He became a better executive because of it.
[01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:12.880]   Of course they developed Next Step, which became OS 10.
[01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:21.880]   He even says that he learned a lot after leaving apple at Next and then at Pixar about running a company,
[01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:23.880]   something he didn't really know anything about.
[01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:24.880]   I think you're right.
[01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:27.880]   I think that it's interesting how it all played out.
[01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:29.880]   Maybe John Scully shouldn't have any regrets.
[01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:31.880]   We might not have the apple we have today.
[01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:34.880]   Had he not forced Jobs out into the wilderness.
[01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:38.880]   He went on a Campbellian warrior's hero journey.
[01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:39.880]   Yeah.
[01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:40.880]   Absolutely.
[01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:42.880]   Just like Simba, the Lion King.
[01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:44.880]   He had to be cast out of the pride.
[01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:48.880]   I think we do call John Scully Scar as a matter of fact.
[01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:50.880]   Not to his face.
[01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:52.880]   That's a cool voice.
[01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:56.880]   Is Scar played by Alan Rickman?
[01:04:56.880 --> 01:04:57.880]   Who played?
[01:04:57.880 --> 01:05:01.880]   They've re-released the Lion King in 3D.
[01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:04.880]   They've re-released the Lion King in 3D and it is huge again.
[01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:05.880]   It's amazing.
[01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:06.880]   It's really amazing.
[01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:07.880]   Jeremy Irons.
[01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:08.880]   Thank you.
[01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:10.880]   The chat room knew that too.
[01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:13.880]   You saw the shout out.
[01:05:13.880 --> 01:05:17.880]   I played it on Twitch that Jobs got from Stevie Wonder.
[01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:20.880]   He was performing in a concert on Saturday in Echo Park.
[01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:28.880]   And on stage said, "Hey, I just want to shout out to a guy who's going through tough times right now,
[01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:32.880]   but a guy who really made a difference for people like me, blind people,
[01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:37.880]   by making Macintosh and iOS accessible."
[01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:40.880]   And he said, "I think you really.
[01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:43.880]   I thought that was really moving."
[01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:47.880]   And apparently there's a rap song dedicated.
[01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:49.880]   Don't play it.
[01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:51.880]   Eileen knows me so well.
[01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:53.880]   It's apparently very not safe for work.
[01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:58.880]   Well, I would only play the very end, which that's the only part that mentions Steve Jobs.
[01:05:58.880 --> 01:05:59.880]   That's okay.
[01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:00.880]   It's okay.
[01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:04.880]   The actual game boss on Twitter says, "Check out and download my new song,
[01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:08.880]   Steve Jobs, here for free."
[01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:12.880]   And he's a rapper from Buffalo, New York.
[01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:17.880]   And it's a rap song to Steve Jobs, but the last few lines,
[01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:22.880]   "That's where I why it never bothers me when I can't even say this.
[01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:25.880]   Those guys copy all my moves, my competition's hollow,
[01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:29.880]   my product sets the standard for the rest of you all to follow.
[01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:32.880]   Steve Jobs."
[01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:39.880]   It's just a brilliant marketing ploy on the part of the Supreme Boss, Supreme General.
[01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:45.880]   Just put Steve Jobs in the last word of the song, and we'll all talk about it.
[01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:50.880]   From Infinite Loop on ours, Technica, Chris Forsman writing,
[01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:54.880]   "We may be seeing new iMacs in 2011.
[01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:58.880]   We just got new iMacs not so long ago.
[01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:04.880]   We did 2011 and late 2011 iMacs in this Apple knowledge base article."
[01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:08.880]   I don't think that's true, actually, though.
[01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:13.880]   The late 2011 iMac, they took the reference out,
[01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:18.880]   but Apple called the Educational iMac the late 2011.
[01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:20.880]   It was really the 9.99 one.
[01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:24.880]   So even though it came out earlier in 2011, that's what they called the late 2011.
[01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:27.880]   Well, it came out in August.
[01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:31.880]   Yeah, and there's a knowledge base article that labels it,
[01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:33.880]   it labels it the late 2011.
[01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:36.880]   The mistake was that it was included in a Thunderbolt article,
[01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:38.880]   and it doesn't have Thunderbolt.
[01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:43.880]   There was a mistake somewhere, but I don't think that means there'll be another iMac out.
[01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:51.880]   See, this is why we read Mac rumors, because Arnold knows he's got the analytics smarts.
[01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:57.880]   Back to school, Mac sales outpace PCs even without the white iMac.
[01:07:57.880 --> 01:08:04.880]   NPD Group saying that the Apple grew much faster than the Windows notebook market did
[01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:10.880]   in the September quarter, or maybe pre-September quarter.
[01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:12.880]   I don't know if they would know.
[01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:17.880]   They do, you know, always do that promotion in August, in this case,
[01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:20.880]   $100 App Store gift card with the purchase of a Mac.
[01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:26.880]   Last year they got an iPod touch, which was worth more, twice as much in fact,
[01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:34.880]   but it seems to have not her hindered sales for education.
[01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:37.880]   Interesting.
[01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:42.880]   Maybe I'm curious, what do you guys think now that you've seen it of Windows 8?
[01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:44.880]   I think it's fantastic.
[01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:51.880]   I've got it running on my in the virtual box on my Mac hero,
[01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:55.880]   so have an older Windows machine back home that's running it natively.
[01:08:55.880 --> 01:08:58.880]   And I think there's a lot of great potential here.
[01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:02.880]   I would love to see a couple of really nice,
[01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:11.880]   more ambitious Metro apps realize that to really see what it's like to live in this new user interface
[01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:16.880]   and try to actually get work done, because all the sample apps that are written for Metro
[01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:19.880]   right now are just little doo-dads sort of things.
[01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:21.880]   Remember that just got released to developers last week.
[01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:26.880]   But the first time they get to see like an iPad style text editor that works,
[01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:31.880]   that can do like a whole column on, and then see how easy it would be to live entirely
[01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:37.880]   in the Metro environment, because it really is a nice level of commitment
[01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:42.880]   where you start off and it's not as though you can launch an app and you have to launch
[01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:44.880]   yourself into the special environment.
[01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:46.880]   No, that is where you wind up.
[01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:51.880]   You wind up in tile land, and you only wind up looking at the classic Windows interface
[01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:58.880]   when you find yourself into that end of the rabbit hole that will dump you out in Windows 7 land,
[01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:02.880]   because otherwise you could spend your entire workday, your entire work week looking at nothing,
[01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:05.880]   but Metro apps, and it looks very, very nice.
[01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:11.880]   I can't wait to see what it's like to use this on a tablet, because I'm just obviously using it
[01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:16.880]   with just like the mousepad and the keyboard, and even with the keyboard it's impressive,
[01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:21.880]   but it really is an interface, it really wants to be tapped and swiped and squeezed and pinched.
[01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:27.880]   So this is just a developer edition at this point, but I really like what I'm seeing,
[01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:29.880]   and I can't wait to see the next version.
[01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:31.880]   That's the thing that struck me.
[01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:37.880]   It's very clearly at least this new start menu, it's very clearly a tablet interface I'm logging in right now,
[01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:42.880]   also in virtualization on my Mac, but I was wondering how a business would take to us,
[01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:47.880]   how people using desktops and laptops would take to it, because it is so tabletmatic, you know?
[01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:52.880]   Well, it does work very well on a keyboard, a keyboard and mouse,
[01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:57.880]   because if you have a newer Windows machine that has a nice big multi-touch trackpad,
[01:10:57.880 --> 01:11:02.880]   I think it would work just about as well as a new MacBook Air does with Lion.
[01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:06.880]   There are keyboard equivalents to everything, and just as with Lion,
[01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:09.880]   you do like the multi-touch stuff with the trackpad, but as soon as you realize that,
[01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:13.880]   "Oh, I can just actually hit this key to switch between apps instead of having to swipe anything,"
[01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:15.880]   you do learn that.
[01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:21.880]   I think it's kind of interesting, though, that whereas Apple was very, very quick to say that,
[01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:27.880]   quick to release versions of iWork for iPad and then the iPhone,
[01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:32.880]   Microsoft hasn't even implied whether or not there's going to be anything office-like
[01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:35.880]   from Microsoft that will take advantage of Metro.
[01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:40.880]   It could be that it's just so early in the process that there's still lots and lots of those conference room
[01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:47.880]   fights going on at Microsoft about what Metro really is, and are we going to claim that this is sort of like
[01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:53.880]   the Windows Me version of Windows, rest windows, the classic interface will still be for the real professional apps,
[01:11:53.880 --> 01:12:00.880]   or should we really go all in here and just make sure that everything that we do has an articulation for the Metro interface.
[01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:05.880]   I think that there's less confusion so much as this is still very much an ongoing discussion,
[01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:12.880]   I think that Microsoft is having, but like I said, it's just such a natural way of working that can't wait to see more of it.
[01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:19.880]   Yeah, I just can't imagine that they won't have a switch that says, "Please put me in the normal Windows mode for businesses
[01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:22.880]   and people who just don't want to be using this."
[01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:27.880]   Well, apparently, my pulse around saying that the next version of Office is going to use the Metro interface.
[01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:34.880]   Well, does he mean that, remember that Metro, one of the hallmarks of real Metro interface is that it's like the iPad,
[01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:38.880]   there's no overlapping windows, it's just one big full-screen window, maybe a sidebar.
[01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:45.880]   Does he mean that there's going to be Metro design cues implemented in the standard Windows,
[01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:51.880]   winter window interface, or are they really going to have a really sharp partition between what's expected
[01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:53.880]   and Metro and what's expected of classic windows?
[01:12:53.880 --> 01:13:00.880]   Good question, Alaska. I don't know. I interpret it to be full-screen Metro style, but I don't know.
[01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:08.880]   Because this is probably the third major thing we've seen the Metro interface in, the first one being the last version of the zone,
[01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:11.880]   the second one being Windows Phone, and now we're actually finally seeing it in a desktop.
[01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:16.880]   So I don't know whether they mean design cues or what, but it's interesting if you play with the...
[01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:19.880]   This is not Windows break weekly.
[01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:23.880]   Well, it's relevant because I think this is clearly a response to the iPad.
[01:13:23.880 --> 01:13:25.880]   I mean, there's no question in my mind.
[01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:31.880]   I just think it's really interesting to see how kind of fractured the whole experience is.
[01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:37.880]   When you're in Metro, it's wonderful, and it would look really great on a tablet in any form.
[01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:43.880]   Even if you couldn't... There's some controversy still about whether or not you will be able to run Windows,
[01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:50.880]   like classic Windows overlapping apps, on a low-powered tablet, or whether that's going to be a Metro-only experience.
[01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:54.880]   But when you look at the... On a desktop on the Windows, the classic Windows experience,
[01:13:54.880 --> 01:14:01.880]   you start to see not only a lack of that elegant, tiled interface,
[01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:06.880]   but it's almost as if this is where all the people who hated Metro at Microsoft
[01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:12.880]   and did not work in that project wound up, and they are sort of raising a middle finger at that side of the screen.
[01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:17.880]   Because now there's a new, huge, immense ribbon in Windows Explorer
[01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:22.880]   that every time you're... If you're looking at a pictures library,
[01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:28.880]   now there's a ribbon inside the window that has every single task
[01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:32.880]   that's possibly could be related to dealing with a photo library.
[01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:36.880]   And if you're a brand new user, I suppose it's kind of cool to say,
[01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:39.880]   to be able to literally open up the takeout menu and say,
[01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:45.880]   "Okay, I want the peanut noodles with shrimp, spicy peanut peanut peanut peanut...
[01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:52.880]   "nutals, noodles, noodles, but it does mean that God help you if you're going to need a 4K display
[01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:55.880]   to get all this user interface in just one window."
[01:14:55.880 --> 01:14:57.880]   Well, this was always a complaint I had about the ribbon,
[01:14:57.880 --> 01:15:00.880]   and Microsoft said we had to do the ribbon because people didn't...
[01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:03.880]   If we don't surface these commands, nobody ever finds them.
[01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:06.880]   So, putting them in the menu isn't enough.
[01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:08.880]   That's an interesting point of view.
[01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:13.880]   I don't necessarily... I think it's ugly, I think it's kind of clumsy,
[01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:18.880]   but they might be proven right here, because one of the things that's been
[01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:25.880]   occurring to me about iOS and with Mac OS is that when we first were introduced
[01:15:25.880 --> 01:15:29.880]   to the Macintosh, you could write out everything you need to know beforehand
[01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:34.880]   on one side of a business card and have room for a phone number.
[01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:37.880]   There's really almost nothing you needed that wasn't available to you
[01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:39.880]   and explorable and discoverable.
[01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:43.880]   Now, you really do need to know that you see this gray piece of glass
[01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:44.880]   at the front of your keyboard?
[01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:47.880]   Here is the library of gestures that activate certain things.
[01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:52.880]   There's this thing called Mission Control that you have to look into the dock
[01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:56.880]   to find it because... Here's places where you should start looking for features.
[01:15:56.880 --> 01:15:59.880]   Here are times when you should just sort of randomly hold down the option key
[01:15:59.880 --> 01:16:02.880]   while you click on things just to see if anything interesting happens.
[01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:06.880]   Like, you're playing the first level of a video game and you keep getting killed.
[01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:11.880]   So, I think Microsoft is wrong here in trying to put more interface visible,
[01:16:11.880 --> 01:16:15.880]   but we'll find out when this thing ships and a lot of...
[01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:18.880]   It's possible that people who've been frustrated by Windows for a long time
[01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:22.880]   are going to say, "Yes, I have no idea that I could do that with this...
[01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:24.880]   with a pictures library."
[01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:28.880]   I had no idea that it was possible for me to share this file
[01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:30.880]   with everybody who's inside my workgroup.
[01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:32.880]   There were these features that were already always in Windows,
[01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:35.880]   but there was never a button saying, "Share this with my workgroup,"
[01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:40.880]   or, "Share this and click to drag names into this to figure out who's going to be able to see this folder
[01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:42.880]   and put files into it."
[01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:45.880]   But the bigger point is that it's interesting that this is the difference
[01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:50.880]   between Apple's point of view saying that we want to have an entirely dedicated device
[01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:55.880]   and an entirely dedicated operating system where the whole design language is.
[01:16:55.880 --> 01:16:58.880]   If it's possible for us to hide a control, we will hide that control.
[01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:03.880]   If it's possible to make this display more clean and have less fewer distractions,
[01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:04.880]   we're going to do that.
[01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:08.880]   Even if sometimes it means you're going to have to read, let's say, a CD booklet
[01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:10.880]   to find out how to use things.
[01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:13.880]   Rass Microsoft is saying, "Nope, we want one grand unified operating system
[01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:16.880]   that will articulate itself on any device and any different app."
[01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:22.880]   And if it means that people have to sort of have a computer
[01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:25.880]   that's like a sugar frosted mini-wheat, it's got the sugar frosted side,
[01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:29.880]   but then the entire other shredded wheat side you cannot see until you flip it over,
[01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:34.880]   it's an interesting battle that's going to be coming up in 2012 and 2013, I think.
[01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:37.880]   Yeah, I commend them for their guts.
[01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:42.880]   I have some real skepticism about whether one size fits all is going to work.
[01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:45.880]   I agree with you, that's kind of where it's going to boil down.
[01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:47.880]   Arnold, have you played with it? Do you care at all?
[01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:49.880]   No, I care. I found it very interesting.
[01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:52.880]   I find the whole movement towards the metro, the interface,
[01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:55.880]   surprising for Microsoft to take such a bold step.
[01:17:55.880 --> 01:17:56.880]   It is.
[01:17:56.880 --> 01:17:58.880]   I haven't played with it though, so I haven't installed it, I haven't messed with it,
[01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:00.880]   I've just seen some of the early videos.
[01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:06.880]   I mean, in my mind, what was interesting is that once this becomes
[01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:11.880]   the normal Windows interface, once millions of people start using it,
[01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:14.880]   I wonder what will happen to Windows Phone Market Share,
[01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:17.880]   because suddenly the Windows phones will be familiar.
[01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:18.880]   Right.
[01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:21.880]   Because currently you pick up a Windows mobile phone.
[01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:24.880]   I don't even know the right name, Windows Mobile Seven Phone.
[01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:27.880]   And it's very foreign.
[01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:31.880]   I mean, if you haven't used one before, and I've messed with one briefly,
[01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:34.880]   but it just felt foreign to me at the time.
[01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:37.880]   But pretty soon, the metro interface, it'll all sort of converge
[01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:39.880]   for on the Windows side at least.
[01:18:39.880 --> 01:18:42.880]   I'm sure that's kind of the point for Microsoft.
[01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:43.880]   Yeah, definitely.
[01:18:43.880 --> 01:18:49.880]   And suddenly Windows will be just a very familiar option as a phone,
[01:18:49.880 --> 01:18:51.880]   once that becomes prevalent.
[01:18:51.880 --> 01:18:54.880]   It's interesting because their first attempt at a Windows phone
[01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:57.880]   was shrinking Microsoft Windows down to phone size, miserable flop.
[01:18:57.880 --> 01:18:59.880]   You don't need to start menu on a phone.
[01:18:59.880 --> 01:19:01.880]   Now they're doing the opposite.
[01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:02.880]   Right.
[01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:05.880]   We'll make a phone operating system and we'll blow it up to fit to the desktop.
[01:19:05.880 --> 01:19:10.880]   And I think in both cases, I think what Apple's done is a little more sensible,
[01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:16.880]   because there's a similarity, there's a core, a similarity between the two.
[01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:19.880]   But, you know, and they say OS 10 is at the core of iOS and all of that.
[01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:23.880]   But it's very clear, there's a touch portable operating system
[01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:27.880]   and there's a truck-based operating system, a desktop operating system.
[01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:31.880]   And I don't mind the lion full screen and stuff like that
[01:19:31.880 --> 01:19:35.880]   and the gestures on the desktop, but it's still fundamentally a desktop computer
[01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:37.880]   with some tablet-y blossom.
[01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:42.880]   See, but don't you think that, see, I always thought that the launchpad
[01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:47.880]   and the app store were the first steps to making Apple's version of
[01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:51.880]   this looks just like an iOS device you're familiar with already.
[01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:54.880]   So it's sort of the opposite of where Microsoft's trying to go,
[01:19:54.880 --> 01:19:58.880]   trying to familiarize everyone with on the desktop and then go have them jump over to mobile too.
[01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:04.880]   There's millions of iOS devices out there, so is Apple, like I said,
[01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:08.880]   I didn't think lion would do it, but I thought pretty soon we would see
[01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:14.880]   sort of this iOS shell, which is basically launchpad plus Mac App Store,
[01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:19.880]   that would be the default for, you know, mom and pop walking into an Apple store
[01:20:19.880 --> 01:20:21.880]   saying I want to buy a computer.
[01:20:21.880 --> 01:20:24.880]   Well, I guess that you can say that both Apple and Microsoft are both trying
[01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:26.880]   from different points of view to deal with the same issue,
[01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:31.880]   which is that the desktop might be dead or dying and that the future is in
[01:20:31.880 --> 01:20:33.880]   a more intimate interface.
[01:20:33.880 --> 01:20:36.880]   And how do we migrate to that?
[01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:42.880]   There's sort of a tell here that something that Apple is doing isn't quite working though.
[01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:47.880]   Here I am, I'm just going to be gone for 24 or 36 hours from my office.
[01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:51.880]   I've got one small project where I need desktop apps,
[01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:56.880]   and so once again I'm traveling with my MacBook and my iPad.
[01:20:56.880 --> 01:21:02.880]   Whereas if Apple decided to make a tablet that's sort of like the developer tablet,
[01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:09.880]   the i5 based developer tablet went out, where it has this shape to it so that when I'm on
[01:21:09.880 --> 01:21:13.880]   Amtrak, I just want to read some books or I just wanted to casually, you know,
[01:21:13.880 --> 01:21:17.880]   catch up with news, it acts like this, but then when I get to my hotel room,
[01:21:17.880 --> 01:21:21.880]   I turn it like this and put it on a cheap plastic stand and get out my Bluetooth keyboard
[01:21:21.880 --> 01:21:25.880]   and my Bluetooth mouse, and it is a full functioning desktop computer
[01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:30.880]   that has that really cool multi-touch iPad-like interface,
[01:21:30.880 --> 01:21:35.880]   but occasionally can open itself up and be multi-windling so I can manage like three different apps
[01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:37.880]   and multiple research sources.
[01:21:37.880 --> 01:21:42.880]   If that were a $800 computer, I wouldn't really care that in tablet mode,
[01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:44.880]   it only works for about four hours on battery.
[01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:50.880]   I might not necessarily care that it has a fan that will start blowing when I'm playing flash video
[01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:52.880]   or doing something kind of strenuous.
[01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:56.880]   That's an interesting product and I think that when Apple has really knocked it,
[01:21:56.880 --> 01:22:00.880]   they will figure out a way that I can always travel with just this
[01:22:00.880 --> 01:22:04.880]   and never have to take something more substantial with me.
[01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:11.880]   Maybe that may be an unattainable goal, but that's kind of an interesting obstacle.
[01:22:11.880 --> 01:22:13.880]   I think that's where they're heading.
[01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:18.880]   I think that's where both companies are heading and taking it from different ends of the same thing.
[01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:20.880]   It is an interesting thing to watch.
[01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:23.880]   Of course, we're the wrong guys to ask.
[01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:27.880]   At least I'm the wrong guy because I'm an old fart and I just want my desktop and my laptop.
[01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:28.880]   That's what I like.
[01:22:28.880 --> 01:22:30.880]   I like how it used to be.
[01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:32.880]   Give me a command line.
[01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:36.880]   We're going to take a break, come back with our Apple iOS tip of the day,
[01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:38.880]   our Lion tip of the day, and our Pixel of the Week.
[01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:40.880]   Arnold Kim is here from MacRumors.com.
[01:22:40.880 --> 01:22:44.880]   Great to have you, Arnold Ani and Aco, from Chicago Sun Times.
[01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:50.880]   We're going to take a little tiny time out here to talk about hover.com.
[01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:52.880]   You can go to Macbreak.hover.com.
[01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:58.880]   I was watching football last night and there was, again, the GoDaddy ad and it's like, "I don't get it."
[01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:05.880]   They're focused on hot chicks and not on domain registration.
[01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:06.880]   Excuse me.
[01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:08.880]   I just want to register a domain name.
[01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:09.880]   Would you mind?
[01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:12.880]   Hover gets out of your way, gets it done with fewer clicks.
[01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:15.880]   It's domain names made simple.
[01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:18.880]   If you go to Macbreak.hover.com, you can find out all about it.
[01:23:18.880 --> 01:23:21.880]   I moved all my domains over to Hover.
[01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:25.880]   I used actually their concierge domain transfer service, which was fantastic.
[01:23:25.880 --> 01:23:29.880]   It's $10 for the domain, but that adds a year to your registration.
[01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:32.880]   It's a really good deal if you move over to Hover.
[01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:35.880]   Now they've got two new domain services.
[01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:39.880]   They call them premium domains and clunker trade-ins.
[01:23:39.880 --> 01:23:46.880]   If you search for a website like, let's say, PantsForSail.com,
[01:23:46.880 --> 01:23:50.880]   that might perhaps, domain names that might perhaps already be occupied,
[01:23:50.880 --> 01:23:53.880]   they give you an interesting feature here.
[01:23:53.880 --> 01:23:58.880]   Domains that are owned by somebody else but are available for sale.
[01:23:58.880 --> 01:24:00.880]   They'll come up with a little gold star.
[01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:06.880]   Those are the premium domain names, PantsForSail, PantsForSail, with a star next to it.
[01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:10.880]   It means that somebody owns PantsForSail but is willing to sell it to you.
[01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:14.880]   In fact, they have the price right there, which I think is very interesting.
[01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:20.880]   You can purchase those hard to get domain names right from the domain name search box.
[01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:22.880]   Those stars indicate it.
[01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:27.880]   If you have a clunker domain, domains you've registered or renewed at Hover.com,
[01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:32.880]   and you'd like to upgrade to a better name, they'll take your old domain name back.
[01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:36.880]   In fact, they'll credit you with everything you've spent on that clunker.
[01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:42.880]   When I go to my Hover account, I have a few clunker domain names,
[01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:51.880]   names that I bought because I thought they'd be so great and in fact aren't really all that useful.
[01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:55.880]   They will take everything I've spent on those original registration fee,
[01:24:55.880 --> 01:24:59.880]   any renewal fees, and they will give it back to you.
[01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:05.880]   If you want to trade in a clunker, call customer service on the website or email them at help@hover.com.
[01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:10.880]   I think tunictime.com is never really going to go anywhere.
[01:25:10.880 --> 01:25:15.880]   We have to trade that in, get my money back on that one.
[01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:21.880]   If you want to register your domain name right now at hover.com,
[01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:27.880]   just go to macbreak.hover.com and you can find out more about it.
[01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:32.880]   In fact, I'm going to mention if you go to macbreak.hover.com
[01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:37.880]   and use the offer code macbreak, you'll get 10% off the site.
[01:25:37.880 --> 01:25:41.880]   It doesn't apply to the premium domains, but it does apply to the regular domains.
[01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:44.880]   Macbreak.hover.com, you see how simple it is?
[01:25:44.880 --> 01:25:47.880]   By the way, the domain management on this couldn't be easier.
[01:25:47.880 --> 01:25:50.880]   Actually, at the list of domain names, as I hover over it,
[01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:53.880]   I can unlock, make public, registry, contacts, renew, offcode.
[01:25:53.880 --> 01:25:58.880]   All of this stuff is right here, very simple, very powerful.
[01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:04.880]   It's just really, it couldn't be easier to manage your domain directly from hover.
[01:26:04.880 --> 01:26:06.880]   Macbreak.hover.com.
[01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:10.880]   No sexy girls, not a lot of upsell.
[01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:15.880]   Just domain name registration at a good price, made simple.
[01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:19.880]   Hover, macbreak.hover.com, we thank them for their support.
[01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:23.880]   Andy Naco, your Lion Tip of the Week, my friend.
[01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:27.880]   This is a really cool one, and it has to do with that discoverability thing
[01:26:27.880 --> 01:26:29.880]   that we talked about earlier.
[01:26:29.880 --> 01:26:33.880]   I didn't find out about this until very, very recently.
[01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:39.880]   Sometimes you actually want to move files and work with files without actually using the mouse keyboard
[01:26:39.880 --> 01:26:40.880]   and the finder.
[01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:47.880]   With Lion, Apple has actually added copy and paste features to files in the finder.
[01:26:47.880 --> 01:26:54.880]   If you need to move a file or folder or group of files, just select them in folder A, hit command C,
[01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:58.880]   move to whatever target volume, target window it is, then hit command V.
[01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:03.880]   It will copy them from the origin and paste them to the destination,
[01:27:03.880 --> 01:27:07.880]   so it's just like dragging them from point A to point B.
[01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:09.880]   I like it.
[01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:13.880]   It doesn't work with a cut copy and paste, for instance.
[01:27:13.880 --> 01:27:18.880]   You can't hit command X, these files get removed from that folder and then put them to the clipboard,
[01:27:18.880 --> 01:27:20.880]   then you paste them someplace else.
[01:27:20.880 --> 01:27:24.880]   I believe that you can use option command C.
[01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:26.880]   No, you can't.
[01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:27.880]   No.
[01:27:27.880 --> 01:27:33.880]   You can do, but command C and command V absolutely work for moving files or groups of files from one place to another.
[01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:34.880]   I use that all the time.
[01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:36.880]   It's a really nice shortcut.
[01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:41.880]   I had to actually go back to the snow leopard to make sure that you sure that wasn't in snow leopard?
[01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:42.880]   Nope.
[01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:43.880]   It's been in Windows for a long time.
[01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:44.880]   Maybe that's where you were.
[01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:45.880]   Yeah.
[01:27:45.880 --> 01:27:50.880]   There was utility that you let you do that in a snow leopard, but I don't believe that it's a snow leopard feature.
[01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:58.880]   We don't have Alex Lindsey here to do our iOS tip, but I do have some emails, Macbreak@twit.tv.
[01:27:58.880 --> 01:28:05.880]   Kurt wants to know what cover I have on this 11 inch MacBook Air, and this is the incipio feather light,
[01:28:05.880 --> 01:28:06.880]   which I really like.
[01:28:06.880 --> 01:28:10.880]   Alex Lindsey was a guy who turned me on to this originally.
[01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:14.880]   What we did actually, John went out and bought a whole bunch of them so that when we have hosts,
[01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:19.880]   because sometimes we have hosts, and the whole table is filled with glowing Apple logos,
[01:28:19.880 --> 01:28:23.880]   and I don't want it to look like it's the Apple show.
[01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:28.880]   We'll give these, we loan these to hosts so they can, and they cover or they protect.
[01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:30.880]   There's no overheating problem.
[01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:32.880]   I think that might be one thing people are concerned with.
[01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:35.880]   I've never had a problem with my MacBook Air because there's a little grid on the bottom.
[01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:40.880]   Yes, spec does make ones that are translucent, but these are opaque.
[01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:45.880]   These are from incipio, and I think they're $30 or $40 each.
[01:28:45.880 --> 01:28:48.880]   They're really nice, and they have them for all models.
[01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:50.880]   I think these shells are a really good thing for anybody to buy.
[01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:55.880]   I have one from in case, and it's been on my MacBook since the day I got it.
[01:28:55.880 --> 01:29:00.880]   Not only is it just good protection because you're sort of, hopefully, looking forward to the day two or three years from now,
[01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:04.880]   but maybe you get a little bit something back for your old machine when you trade it
[01:29:04.880 --> 01:29:07.880]   and on a new one, and that'll really help the resale value.
[01:29:07.880 --> 01:29:12.880]   But also, how many times do you go through airport security and you nervously count?
[01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:18.880]   That is the third silver 15-inch MacBook Pro I've seen in this trade.
[01:29:18.880 --> 01:29:19.880]   It's nice to find it.
[01:29:19.880 --> 01:29:23.880]   I wish I put a sticker or something on it so people would take mine by accident.
[01:29:23.880 --> 01:29:29.880]   Well, we all have MacBook Air, so in fact, it is important we have different colors for our feather cases.
[01:29:29.880 --> 01:29:35.880]   Somebody, Mark is asking, he has an older iMac.
[01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:41.880]   He wants to keep an upgrade to the line, but he's considering putting in something called an MCE Opti-Bay Drive Kit
[01:29:41.880 --> 01:29:43.880]   to add an SSD.
[01:29:43.880 --> 01:29:49.880]   Basically, it takes the optical drive out, puts a mounting kit in there so you can add an SSD and then have two drives
[01:29:49.880 --> 01:29:54.880]   as the new iMacs do, a solid-state drive and a spinning hard drive.
[01:29:54.880 --> 01:29:58.880]   I actually use the Opti-Bay to upgrade a laptop.
[01:29:58.880 --> 01:30:00.880]   I'm kind of fumble fingers.
[01:30:00.880 --> 01:30:07.880]   I was able to use it and in fact put a spinning drive and a solid-state drive in one of my 15-inch MacBook Pros.
[01:30:07.880 --> 01:30:09.880]   They work as advertised.
[01:30:09.880 --> 01:30:11.880]   A little overpriced for what you get.
[01:30:11.880 --> 01:30:13.880]   They're really not very complicated.
[01:30:13.880 --> 01:30:17.880]   It's just connectors and a metal holder that takes the place of the optical drive.
[01:30:17.880 --> 01:30:23.880]   And it's a little weird because you still have a slot, but it's blocked off, so you try to put a disc and just goes
[01:30:23.880 --> 01:30:24.880]   "Huh, huh."
[01:30:24.880 --> 01:30:27.880]   He says, "Have you opened up an iMac? Is it worth it?"
[01:30:27.880 --> 01:30:30.880]   That, I have to say, I do not recommend.
[01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:34.880]   It is possible if you go to YouTube, you can watch the videos. I recommend you watch the videos.
[01:30:34.880 --> 01:30:40.880]   The issue with the iMac is the glass on the front, you need suction cups to remove it and just scares that pants off
[01:30:40.880 --> 01:30:41.880]   of me to do that.
[01:30:41.880 --> 01:30:43.880]   Having said that, we have opened up our iMacs.
[01:30:43.880 --> 01:30:48.880]   I just think that's probably something unless you're very comfortable working inside a stuff like that.
[01:30:48.880 --> 01:30:51.880]   I would let somebody else do it.
[01:30:51.880 --> 01:30:57.880]   In general, when you have a device that Apple did not mean people have access to, you can get it open.
[01:30:57.880 --> 01:31:01.880]   You can perform whatever trick you think that you're being told to perform.
[01:31:01.880 --> 01:31:05.880]   And you probably, if you're careful, will be able to get it back together okay.
[01:31:05.880 --> 01:31:10.880]   But because this is the first time you've ever done it, and if, assuming you even have bought exactly the right tools,
[01:31:10.880 --> 01:31:14.880]   the fit will probably not be spot on.
[01:31:14.880 --> 01:31:19.880]   So I wouldn't do that sort of thing unless I were absolutely sure that whatever I was going to do was going to be completely
[01:31:19.880 --> 01:31:20.880]   worth it.
[01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:28.880]   And when it comes to adding an SSD, a sidecar, as a boot drive, I'm not 100% convinced that there's a real difference
[01:31:28.880 --> 01:31:32.880]   between swapping out a mechanical drive for an SSD and that's all your storage.
[01:31:32.880 --> 01:31:38.880]   That will always be a huge speed improvement that will always on a mobile device let you just simply close it
[01:31:38.880 --> 01:31:41.880]   and walk away without having to wait for them to spin down.
[01:31:41.880 --> 01:31:47.880]   When you have a hybrid drive like that, you're still dealing with a problem of slow disk swaps for certain types of
[01:31:47.880 --> 01:31:48.880]   functions.
[01:31:48.880 --> 01:31:55.880]   Like if you're using really heavy like disk access apps like Photoshop and movie editing shouldn't be a problem
[01:31:55.880 --> 01:31:58.880]   if that's your boot drive and that's all that you're using that boot drive for.
[01:31:58.880 --> 01:32:04.880]   It shouldn't be a problem for like regular kernel type disk swaps.
[01:32:04.880 --> 01:32:11.880]   But I'm not convinced that you would get such a huge and revolutionary speed boost that would be worth taking apart
[01:32:11.880 --> 01:32:14.880]   in iMacport or giving up an optical drive.
[01:32:14.880 --> 01:32:23.880]   The chatroom's suggesting, and I agree, iFixit.com they have parts and tools and videos for doing all of these kinds of things.
[01:32:23.880 --> 01:32:30.880]   So if you're going to take apart an iMac, they actually sell the suction cups, all the parts that you need to do the upgrade.
[01:32:30.880 --> 01:32:35.880]   Even if you're doing something as simple as upgrading the RAM in your MacBook which is something that Apple allows you to do,
[01:32:35.880 --> 01:32:41.880]   your first step is iFixit because they will give you exhaustive, beautiful shot by shot, step by step,
[01:32:41.880 --> 01:32:43.880]   guys you can just download for free.
[01:32:43.880 --> 01:32:45.880]   Yeah, and the tools if you want the suction cups.
[01:32:45.880 --> 01:32:47.880]   I like Colleen doing it.
[01:32:47.880 --> 01:32:50.880]   In fact, she did it on the air as I remember.
[01:32:50.880 --> 01:32:52.880]   That's how brave she was.
[01:32:52.880 --> 01:32:54.880]   It's time for our picks of the week.
[01:32:54.880 --> 01:32:59.880]   I don't know if we warned you Arnold or not that we do these picks, but I'm going to let you think for a bit.
[01:32:59.880 --> 01:33:02.880]   And if you've got a pick, I would love to hear from you.
[01:33:02.880 --> 01:33:07.880]   But I actually think Andy's pick is kind of a little unusual.
[01:33:07.880 --> 01:33:09.880]   Do you want to talk about this Andy?
[01:33:09.880 --> 01:33:11.880]   It's really cool.
[01:33:11.880 --> 01:33:14.880]   I had a pick of the week a while ago.
[01:33:14.880 --> 01:33:18.880]   The Steinway company had this really cool iPhone app that was just a metronome,
[01:33:18.880 --> 01:33:20.880]   but it was the most beautiful metronome ever.
[01:33:20.880 --> 01:33:23.880]   And it just made you want to just play with it and just hear it go.
[01:33:23.880 --> 01:33:33.880]   So apparently they are really getting into iOS apps because they now have a new app that just got released last week called A2D.
[01:33:33.880 --> 01:33:37.880]   And what it is, it's like an iTunes store for sheet music.
[01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:40.880]   Now let's see if this will actually work.
[01:33:40.880 --> 01:33:46.880]   I've purchased this Beethoven piano sonata Opus number 79 first movement.
[01:33:46.880 --> 01:33:49.880]   And what it will do is I got it in landscape mode.
[01:33:49.880 --> 01:33:54.880]   And what it will do is it will actually see if you can actually see it.
[01:33:54.880 --> 01:33:55.880]   Yeah, it's playing.
[01:33:55.880 --> 01:33:59.880]   It will play it, but it will also like keep you through.
[01:33:59.880 --> 01:34:00.880]   It'll like mark you.
[01:34:00.880 --> 01:34:01.880]   It's highlighting it.
[01:34:01.880 --> 01:34:02.880]   Yeah.
[01:34:02.880 --> 01:34:06.880]   And it's really like stands it by stands it and you don't have to have it play it for you.
[01:34:06.880 --> 01:34:14.880]   You can just simply use it as a piece of as a electronic piece of music that will simply turn the pages for you as you play on your real piano.
[01:34:14.880 --> 01:34:27.880]   But it has so many cool features to it that part of it is that at the bottom, like if you're I have never the place where I hit the wall in my music education was learning how to sight read music and I just can't do it.
[01:34:27.880 --> 01:34:32.880]   And I haven't had a learner from new piece of music.
[01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:35.880]   It would always be just carefully learning by road.
[01:34:35.880 --> 01:34:36.880]   Here's where I put my hands here.
[01:34:36.880 --> 01:34:38.880]   Here's where I put my hands here and working it that way.
[01:34:38.880 --> 01:34:46.880]   So you can actually turn off the sound and it will just simply as it's highlighting the piece of music show you what keys are being pressed at this point.
[01:34:46.880 --> 01:34:50.880]   You can slow it down half half speed, quarter speed, whatever you want to keep up with it.
[01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:55.880]   So you don't have to have it landscape mode if you have it like this.
[01:34:55.880 --> 01:34:57.880]   You can also have it in portrait mode.
[01:34:57.880 --> 01:34:58.880]   There you go.
[01:34:58.880 --> 01:35:01.880]   Obviously and you'll be able to see the full sheet of music at once.
[01:35:01.880 --> 01:35:10.880]   So they have classical they have like pop rock jazz as they just started off and they already have like a pretty good collection of music.
[01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:19.880]   If you want to get before I learn how to play Bohemian Rhapsody for buck 99, 299 for the sheet music, you can download and learn how to play Bohemian Rhapsody.
[01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:29.880]   It's not only a cool app but also I think this is one of those things that you can use to explain to people the difference.
[01:35:29.880 --> 01:35:33.880]   The why Apple is the leader in iPad in tablet apps.
[01:35:33.880 --> 01:35:39.880]   Why iOS has such a huge lead over everything else because could you even imagine.
[01:35:39.880 --> 01:35:44.880]   Think about all the things that have to happen for an app like this to actually work.
[01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:51.880]   Not only just from a technical point of view but just for to be able to keep up with a live performance for to look as good as it does.
[01:35:51.880 --> 01:36:01.880]   And also for a company to say we are willing to create a brand new online store for sheet music within app purchases and we think that we can sell enough copies of this.
[01:36:01.880 --> 01:36:03.880]   That is going to be a really great business for us.
[01:36:03.880 --> 01:36:06.880]   I don't think it's ever going to happen with Android.
[01:36:06.880 --> 01:36:07.880]   Even Microsoft.
[01:36:07.880 --> 01:36:10.880]   Good luck to them if they can actually get this working.
[01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:18.880]   I know that there are apps that professional orchestras use for electronic sheet music but they are task oriented tablet apps.
[01:36:18.880 --> 01:36:20.880]   So there is nothing I don't like about this.
[01:36:20.880 --> 01:36:21.880]   The app itself is free.
[01:36:21.880 --> 01:36:22.880]   It comes with free music.
[01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:26.880]   The music store has a whole bunch of free music on it.
[01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:32.880]   Chances are that if a piece of music is in the public domain you can download the sheet music for free.
[01:36:32.880 --> 01:36:37.880]   It's like the modern stuff that costs about 9999 per but really cool app.
[01:36:37.880 --> 01:36:41.880]   At the very minimum you kind of want to play with it and just watch the keys go.
[01:36:41.880 --> 01:36:43.880]   It's like having a player piano in front of you.
[01:36:43.880 --> 01:36:44.880]   It's called Steinway etude.
[01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:45.880]   It's free.
[01:36:45.880 --> 01:36:52.880]   I think it's interesting that the number one selling song for our Steinway etude is Linus the Linus and Lucy theme for Buck99.
[01:36:52.880 --> 01:36:55.880]   The number two song journeys don't stop believing.
[01:36:55.880 --> 01:36:57.880]   You figure it out.
[01:36:57.880 --> 01:37:00.880]   My pick of the week is just a reminder.
[01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:10.880]   When I downloaded and wanted to install Windows 8, of course I want to do it on a Macintosh in emulation.
[01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:12.880]   There's VirtualBox which is free.
[01:37:12.880 --> 01:37:14.880]   A little tricky to get it working.
[01:37:14.880 --> 01:37:23.880]   VMware has updated Fusion to version 4, $50 upgrade which I think is actually a pretty good deal.
[01:37:23.880 --> 01:37:27.880]   So if you want Windows 8 runs well in VMware, a Fusion 4.
[01:37:27.880 --> 01:37:28.880]   You do need the update.
[01:37:28.880 --> 01:37:29.880]   But look at this.
[01:37:29.880 --> 01:37:32.880]   Parallels has decided that they're going to go after the Fusion crowd.
[01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:38.880]   They've released Parallels Desktop 7 and they are now offering it if you have as a cross-grade for VMware Fusion.
[01:37:38.880 --> 01:37:43.880]   If you have VMware Fusion you do need a VMware Fusion serial number for $30.
[01:37:43.880 --> 01:37:48.880]   That's normally it's I think $99 is $100.
[01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:49.880]   I don't have a preference.
[01:37:49.880 --> 01:37:53.880]   Andy do you have a preference in Parallels and VMware Fusion?
[01:37:53.880 --> 01:37:54.880]   Not really.
[01:37:54.880 --> 01:37:56.880]   I actually use VirtualBox because it's free.
[01:37:56.880 --> 01:37:59.880]   It's free and well supported.
[01:37:59.880 --> 01:38:04.880]   When I needed to get Windows 8 running I was able to find, Windows 8 will run in virtualization
[01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:11.880]   but you have to configure the virtual machine so that it has the hardware that the installer, the Windows installer is expecting.
[01:38:11.880 --> 01:38:14.880]   I was able to easily find instructions for that on VirtualBox.
[01:38:14.880 --> 01:38:17.880]   I had more trouble finding it for other VM apps.
[01:38:17.880 --> 01:38:24.880]   Both of these apps will do one thing that I don't know if VirtualBox will do which is you can have a boot camp partition as I do on this Macbook Air.
[01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:27.880]   You don't have to install Windows a second time in the virtualization.
[01:38:27.880 --> 01:38:29.880]   You'll just use that boot camp partition.
[01:38:29.880 --> 01:38:30.880]   Now you get the best of all worlds.
[01:38:30.880 --> 01:38:34.880]   If I want to boot into Windows I can if I want to run in virtualization I can.
[01:38:34.880 --> 01:38:41.880]   To be honest I think Parallels and VMware Fusion are pretty similar in value.
[01:38:41.880 --> 01:38:45.880]   Although I do notice a lot of reviews say they like Parallels lately.
[01:38:45.880 --> 01:38:46.880]   They like Parallels a little bit better.
[01:38:46.880 --> 01:38:47.880]   It's a little bit faster.
[01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:53.880]   All right, now we've got an arm and a lot of time to come up with this pick of the week.
[01:38:53.880 --> 01:38:54.880]   Parallels do you have a pick for us?
[01:38:54.880 --> 01:38:55.880]   I do.
[01:38:55.880 --> 01:38:56.880]   It's a Mac app actually.
[01:38:56.880 --> 01:39:00.880]   It's a Twitter client which I'm not sure if you all have covered before.
[01:39:00.880 --> 01:39:02.880]   It's a free one that's on the Mac App Store.
[01:39:02.880 --> 01:39:04.880]   It's called YerufKuru.
[01:39:04.880 --> 01:39:07.880]   Oh, you know I've seen this but I've never tried it.
[01:39:07.880 --> 01:39:08.880]   Tell us about it.
[01:39:08.880 --> 01:39:11.880]   Yeah, so it's well let me spell it first so people can find it.
[01:39:11.880 --> 01:39:12.880]   Yeah, good idea.
[01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:15.880]   The worst part about it is the name.
[01:39:15.880 --> 01:39:22.880]   I can't remember how to type it but it's Y-O-R-U-F-U-K-U-R-O-U.
[01:39:22.880 --> 01:39:25.880]   It's on the Mac App Store.
[01:39:25.880 --> 01:39:26.880]   It's free.
[01:39:26.880 --> 01:39:29.880]   You think it's just another Twitter client but I don't know.
[01:39:29.880 --> 01:39:34.880]   For a while I was jumping from Twitter clients to our client because I just couldn't.
[01:39:34.880 --> 01:39:37.880]   I felt like I could never really stay up to date on Twitter.
[01:39:37.880 --> 01:39:40.880]   Maybe that's not always a good thing.
[01:39:40.880 --> 01:39:43.880]   But after I download this one I was sold.
[01:39:43.880 --> 01:39:47.880]   It sort of has some of the features of the bigger ones.
[01:39:47.880 --> 01:39:50.880]   The TweetDecks and whatnot.
[01:39:50.880 --> 01:39:54.880]   I never liked TweetDeck because it was an error application.
[01:39:54.880 --> 01:39:56.880]   It just never felt right.
[01:39:56.880 --> 01:39:58.880]   The notifications never worked quite right.
[01:39:58.880 --> 01:40:02.880]   It didn't integrate well with Growl and those sort of things.
[01:40:02.880 --> 01:40:09.880]   What's really nice about YerufKuru is you can do multiple accounts of course.
[01:40:09.880 --> 01:40:12.880]   You can have multiple tabs and there's a lot of good keyboard shortcuts.
[01:40:12.880 --> 01:40:17.880]   Once you get used to it you really feel like you are in...
[01:40:17.880 --> 01:40:22.880]   I don't know, I feel like I have control of my Twitter client and I can jump from place to place.
[01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:26.880]   We easily reply and follow up and those sort of things.
[01:40:26.880 --> 01:40:30.880]   With other ones I've always kind of lost, felt lost in them.
[01:40:30.880 --> 01:40:32.880]   That makes sense.
[01:40:32.880 --> 01:40:33.880]   Yes.
[01:40:33.880 --> 01:40:35.880]   So you prefer this to the free Twitter.
[01:40:35.880 --> 01:40:37.880]   Yeah, this is kind of neat.
[01:40:37.880 --> 01:40:40.880]   I actually just downloaded it and installed it as you were talking.
[01:40:40.880 --> 01:40:41.880]   Yeah.
[01:40:41.880 --> 01:40:42.880]   Very nice.
[01:40:42.880 --> 01:40:43.880]   Very nice.
[01:40:43.880 --> 01:40:47.880]   I prefer it to all, like I said, I kind of jumped at one point.
[01:40:47.880 --> 01:40:50.880]   Because Twitter is important for all of us of course.
[01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:54.880]   I have a lot of followers so it's kind of nice to follow up with people and sort of see what they're saying.
[01:40:54.880 --> 01:41:00.880]   I did feel like I tried every Twitter client out there and it wasn't until most recently.
[01:41:00.880 --> 01:41:07.880]   It's actually a plug for the Mac App Store because I went to the Mac App Store and I was like,
[01:41:07.880 --> 01:41:08.880]   "All right, well let me see.
[01:41:08.880 --> 01:41:09.880]   I just typed in Twitter."
[01:41:09.880 --> 01:41:12.880]   And then all these Twitter clients showed up.
[01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:14.880]   But your Fakuro is actually the highest rated ones.
[01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:17.880]   I was like, "Oh, let me try this one."
[01:41:17.880 --> 01:41:18.880]   And it's great.
[01:41:18.880 --> 01:41:19.880]   Very sweet.
[01:41:19.880 --> 01:41:23.880]   Well, there you go.
[01:41:23.880 --> 01:41:25.880]   And yeah, good luck remembering the name.
[01:41:25.880 --> 01:41:29.880]   Why ORU, F-U-K-U-R-O-U?
[01:41:29.880 --> 01:41:30.880]   Yeah.
[01:41:30.880 --> 01:41:32.880]   That's just good marketing.
[01:41:32.880 --> 01:41:34.880]   It's actually night out in Japanese.
[01:41:34.880 --> 01:41:35.880]   There you go.
[01:41:35.880 --> 01:41:36.880]   Yeah, that's why.
[01:41:36.880 --> 01:41:38.880]   It's from a Japanese development.
[01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:39.880]   Yeah.
[01:41:39.880 --> 01:41:40.880]   Cool.
[01:41:40.880 --> 01:41:41.880]   All right, well I've installed it.
[01:41:41.880 --> 01:41:42.880]   I'll be playing with it.
[01:41:42.880 --> 01:41:43.880]   Thank you for a great tip.
[01:41:43.880 --> 01:41:49.880]   Arnold Kim is at MacRumors.com where he is the editorial director because it's his site.
[01:41:49.880 --> 01:41:50.880]   He founded it.
[01:41:50.880 --> 01:41:54.880]   He's also on Twitter @ArnoldKim and I'm so glad we could get you back on.
[01:41:54.880 --> 01:41:56.880]   We've got to get you back on more often.
[01:41:56.880 --> 01:42:00.880]   MacRumors is a must read for me and prepping for this show and every day.
[01:42:00.880 --> 01:42:03.880]   It's just the source for Macintosh News.
[01:42:03.880 --> 01:42:05.880]   So thank you for doing a great job.
[01:42:05.880 --> 01:42:06.880]   All right, thank you.
[01:42:06.880 --> 01:42:07.880]   Take care, Arnold.
[01:42:07.880 --> 01:42:12.880]   And thanks to you, Andy and I, co-Chicago Sun Times and of course his website www.cwob.com.
[01:42:12.880 --> 01:42:14.880]   When's your speech today?
[01:42:14.880 --> 01:42:15.880]   Tomorrow at noon.
[01:42:15.880 --> 01:42:16.880]   Well good luck with the speech.
[01:42:16.880 --> 01:42:19.880]   So people are going to have lunch an hour later because they're going to be listening
[01:42:19.880 --> 01:42:20.880]   to me.
[01:42:20.880 --> 01:42:22.880]   I don't think I can live up to that kind of expectation.
[01:42:22.880 --> 01:42:23.880]   Wow, that's tough.
