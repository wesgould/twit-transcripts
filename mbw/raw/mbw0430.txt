[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.400]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly the show where we cover the latest Apple news with our good buddies.
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:46.400]   Andy and I've coed to my left from the Chicago Sun times and he's accompanied by his cosplay team.
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.800]   There you go.
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.880]   It's I'm having a reality show of who gets to be my office assistant for the next three quarters.
[00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.640]   And this is the cosplay episode in which you had to go.
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:03.040]   They had a hunting list of they had to get at least eight people including two celebrities who take their picture and post and tweet with the hashtag.
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.600]   Andy not goes intern search and depends on their cue score.
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.440]   But it's their fun group of kids.
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:14.240]   I enjoyed having them work out for about three months before I fired them all because I didn't need them.
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.400]   I wish we could do that.
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.800]   That would be so fun.
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:23.600]   I wanted all of our interns to where Red Star Trek shirts.
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.160]   And Lisa wouldn't go for that.
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.200]   I thought oh that's great because you know they're the red guy.
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.480]   But you wouldn't be for it.
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.440]   You really kind of have them by the throat now because college education is so expensive
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.800]   that if you withhold the college credit they're promised to get for the internship.
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.080]   That's like $9,000 down the hole.
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.800]   And that's why we pay them $25 a week.
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.240]   Renee Richie is also here from iMore.com.
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.240]   Hi Renee.
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.800]   Hey Leo I can't help but notice that they put the red shirt on you today though.
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:52.320]   They did.
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.600]   I am a red shirt today.
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.560]   Look at that.
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.040]   Why is it is who's where's that coming from?
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.800]   Is that me?
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.000]   No you know.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   That's OK.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.040]   OK all my devices are ringing right now.
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.400]   Oh I hate that.
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.520]   This is our backup solution in case the connection goes away.
[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.880]   So that's like a little hangout.
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.680]   It's not a good backup solution.
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.560]   No it happens in my house and it's really horrible.
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.960]   It happened yesterday I was booking our vacation for next year.
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.360]   So I'm talking to the travel agent.
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.520]   She says well it's going to take a while so I'm going to call you back.
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:28.000]   And so there were several callbacks and each time because she was using my Google voice number.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.200]   My computer rings I have finally five or six phones, tablets.
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.040]   They're all ringing.
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.200]   And but the problem is they all ring with different tones.
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.040]   I think this one has this three stooges thing.
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.920]   And your continuity too.
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:42.920]   So yeah.
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:43.920]   Yes.
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:44.920]   That triggers content.
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.600]   Everything is going off.
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.560]   And but I pick up one but it doesn't matter because it takes a while for the rest to figure
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.560]   out.
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.560]   Yes exactly.
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.840]   So so every time she calls me back basically she hears this crazy cacophony of sounds and
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.120]   different ring tones and noises.
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.280]   She must have thought I worked at a symphony or something.
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.120]   I was just talking to like a friend of mine about the differences between like iMessage
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.600]   and like AOL chat the other chat things and telling them that it's like I have to like
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:18.000]   readjust my gen that what is the correct gen teal behavior because I have to I'm used
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.160]   to the idea of trying to figure out well I want to call somebody who I don't want to
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.320]   interrupt them in case they're doing something important.
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:28.400]   But now that the responsibility for someone be wanting not wanting to talk to Andy and
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:33.120]   Otco is now on that person's shoulders because if I use iMessage their phone is going to
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.240]   ring their tablet's going to ring their computer's going to ring as their responsibility to set
[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.520]   up blocks to make sure that they don't have to talk to me unless they don't want to.
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.000]   We're asked remember the remember the good old days when you just see there's a green
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.280]   there's a green jewel there's a yellow jewel or there's a red jewel to say I'm probably
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.920]   I'm probably not in a good mood to talk right now or green flag that says absolutely talk
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:59.200]   to me about what what disappointed you about last night's Simpsons.
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.160]   Open we're open for your calls.
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.400]   The thing with continuity that can be frustrating is that it basically uses Apple's push notification
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.840]   server to alert you the other devices to the call.
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:13.080]   So it essentially sends an iMessage to your iPad and your Mac and then when it discovers
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.440]   they're on the same Wi-Fi network it does something very similar to FaceTime and sends
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.880]   the audio call over.
[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.880]   But if once you hang up it's got to send another message telling them you picked up
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.960]   on the other device and depending on the latency of that message it can keep ringing
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:24.960]   for seconds.
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.960]   Yeah it's a universal problem Skype does this also and I think there's no good fix for
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:30.960]   it.
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:31.960]   But wow.
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.960]   Wow.
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:43.800]   So I am in a red jewel today because well the holidays are upon us we have a late Thanksgiving
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:50.160]   in the US this year which means that everywhere else is celebrating Christmas already before
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.400]   we normally traditionally we wait till the day after Thanksgiving right I haven't got
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:58.560]   the tree or anything but because it's so late this year we're kind of behind.
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.520]   So I thought you know I'm going to break out the red sweater I only get to wear it one
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.400]   month a year and now is the time.
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.440]   It also means I will be the first to go when we run down to the planet.
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:09.880]   I thought it was product red Leo.
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:14.480]   I was just I was assured that you were if I subscribe to Leo right now it's a product
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:15.480]   that Leo.
[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.760]   The product red is an interesting way we're actually we're talking about this before the
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:24.320]   show if you go to the Mac App Store it is normal you know there's not a lot of red in
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:29.800]   fact the Evernote Green kind of dominates my page because it's a featured product but
[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:36.960]   if you go to the iTunes holy cow everything is red all of the apps now are doing red and
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:45.600]   of course this is product red Bono's meta charity that raises money for AIDS research
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:53.600]   and the goal is to have an AIDS free globe in the next few years and it sorts a good
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:59.320]   cause but what I must be Apple does anybody know did Apple do this because even Farmville
[00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:00.720]   is going red.
[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:04.360]   I can't give all the details because they're internal but my understanding is this was
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:08.640]   a rank and file initiative someone inside Apple not management thought of this idea
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:12.360]   and then walked it up the chain and Apple and it's also proved it.
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:15.560]   Yeah it really it's a kind of company Apple is where someone can have an idea like this
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:20.240]   and then it can just spread and they got these 25 developers agreed to it because these apps
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:24.320]   had the kind of in-app purchase or purchase set up that made those these sorts of deals
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:25.320]   possible.
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:29.360]   So when you buy for example garage band you buy a set of loops that money goes to charity
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:33.520]   and then Apple decided to pitch in as well so on Black Friday if you buy something you'll
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:37.840]   be given a gift card and a portion of that gift card will go to product red and then
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:43.520]   Cyber Monday on the online and retail stores if you buy something a percentage of the profit
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:47.600]   Apple makes from those transactions will also go to product red so the developers are pitching
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:48.600]   in and Apple's.
[00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:53.720]   Normally if I purchase something on the Apple store 30% goes to Apple but they say in every
[00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:59.240]   case here 100% is going to product red so that means Apple's giving their 30% up as
[00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:00.240]   well.
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:01.240]   Yeah.
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:02.240]   Wow that's great.
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:07.160]   So here's an example wonderful game Monument Valley and they have a whole separate level
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:13.440]   pack that you can buy that will only be available through December 7th and by the way I download
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:16.840]   it it's really hard which is great.
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:22.200]   So that is and the same thing with Angry Birds they have you know special levels that are
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:27.240]   in app purchases and in this case it's 99 cents for Ida's Red Dream it's not a lot of
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:32.840]   money but that's nice because it goes straight 100% goes straight to product red.
[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:37.080]   And it's indies too like Real Mac is doing it with the clear to do app you can purchase
[00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:40.200]   a clear to do app and part of that will go to product red so it's a good mix.
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:44.880]   I mean Kim Cardassian is in there and at threes it's an incredible range of different apps
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:47.000]   and Apple's own garage band is in there.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.480]   That's neat so with clear you'll get a special red theme but you probably won't want to use
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:57.040]   because everything looks the same but still you'll feel good.
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:58.040]   You'll feel good.
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.040]   You'll feel good.
[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:02.880]   And Apple's done is supported product red for years I mean I remember buying a red iPod
[00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:04.600]   that was the U2 iPod.
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:11.680]   I remember we bought red smart covers for the new iPads both Lisa and Sarah bought red
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:17.680]   covers so those the imprecise went to product red so yeah that's good.
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:18.680]   That's nice.
[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:26.480]   Clash of Clans the bad the warrior has red hair and I read much that.
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:27.480]   Wow.
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:28.480]   We updated their icons.
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:29.480]   We updated their art.
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:32.640]   It was a significant effort it all happened Sunday night which is pretty impressive because
[00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:34.840]   Apple is on vacation this whole week.
[00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:39.480]   And as I understand everything goes through December 7th or 8th so if you want to take
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:48.440]   advantage of these there's a pile of red gems that you can buy to benefit product red
[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:51.040]   and you can then use it to decorate your town hall for the holidays.
[00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:52.040]   It's perfect.
[00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:53.600]   Everybody wins.
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:58.720]   And the best thing is it underscores that consumers should be addicted to in-app purchases.
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.680]   Don't even think about it.
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:01.680]   Don't just do it.
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:02.680]   It's good.
[00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:11.080]   Actually, I don't want to be a Grinch.
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:12.080]   Do it.
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:16.280]   I just want to make sure because you dress like Bobby, not Bob Knight.
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:19.080]   You know the the the the the the coaches to throw chairs as well.
[00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:20.080]   Yeah, Bobby Knight.
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:21.080]   Yeah.
[00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:25.000]   So if you want to if you want to do like cosplay and be in character like that you could.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.560]   I'm just I'm just I was I went to charity navigator to see you know I before I give to
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:36.000]   charity I always go to charity navigator and I see if it's a a four star charity they
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.680]   they will they will investigate the charity as to how much of the money goes to the causes
[00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:45.560]   how much it goes to administration and all that stuff and I like to put pick charities
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:49.720]   where majority you know the four stars what I look for but unfortunately I don't see product
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:51.200]   red in here.
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:56.440]   So I don't know what that means.
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:57.720]   But that's I always like to do that.
[00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:02.240]   I guess red is not a charity in itself and they don't yeah they don't sign in here so
[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:07.360]   they don't but they don't really if you go to red.org which is the product red website
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:12.920]   they don't really say exactly which charities the money goes to is for I mean maybe I can
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:14.320]   find it.
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:18.320]   I don't want to I don't want to put a brain on anybody's parade by any means because I
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:24.240]   mean this is a the causes is good I just want to make sure that it's I get I get nervous
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:28.520]   when I see all these corporations buying into it right.
[00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:32.600]   That's the advantage of with Bono it makes it a trendy or a easy thing for them to do
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:41.840]   I buy Bono and Bobby Shriver in 2006 they've raised immense amounts of money which is which
[00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:49.200]   I mean literally billions of dollars here's the annual report so you can go read the annual
[00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:53.880]   report and see one of the things I like is if you go to apple.com/red it tells you all
[00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:57.920]   about this if you go to apple.com/watch it tells you all about there there URLs are
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:04.280]   just so easy to tell you have been through this these web design scrums this is non non
[00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:05.280]   trivial to do this.
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:08.960]   Yeah it's Friday by select apple products get the gift so that's nice you know I think
[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:13.880]   that's what black Friday should be let's make it red Friday because then it's not about
[00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:18.480]   oh what can I get for a buck and apples never had great black Friday deals it's what's
[00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:21.560]   the black is supposed to be in the black so if you change that to in the red retailers
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:27.840]   well then I could be happy yeah.
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:33.320]   Yeah see I'd like to I'd like to know a little bit more and goodness knows but every where
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:38.200]   I go to read including the apple page doesn't it says it goes to the global fund to help
[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:46.040]   fund AIDS programs in Africa they've raised seventy five million dollars from apple alone
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:51.400]   it says 275 million for the global funds so I was wrong about that but they're but they
[00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:57.400]   I don't see like you know anyway I don't want to be a Grinch and gosh knows I have
[00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:05.680]   plenty of product red products I always buy it when I can.
[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:13.200]   Anyway nice job apple nice job.
[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:17.960]   It is definitely something that fits their role as a retailer as opposed to a tech company
[00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:21.720]   it's like there's a relationship you have with your customers that goes beyond here
[00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:25.880]   we've made this new shiny thing go buy it and it comes to no no you're part of the community
[00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:30.280]   of JCPenney shoppers and you're part of the this the fact that you shop at Whole Foods
[00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:33.920]   says something about you and we're making the special thing that we're doing that as a community
[00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:36.840]   we know that you will love to do and I think that that's something that's very it's still
[00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:38.280]   very very apple.
[00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:46.320]   Here's something this is from the FAQ red takes no money sale money 100% of money from
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:49.280]   the sale of red products goes directly to the ground in Africa in the form of global
[00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:55.960]   fund grants so I guess there there there are a variety of grants and they do give 100%
[00:13:55.960 --> 00:14:01.440]   so I think that's that gives I'll give them four stars to Leo charity navigator to some
[00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:08.200]   four stars or Leo's and by the way it's not tax deductible.
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:12.400]   Since red products are purchased through our corporate partner partners red products are
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:16.560]   not tax deductible you don't get the tax deduction apple.
[00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:22.040]   That doesn't hurt.
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:30.240]   Those poor poor people in Ireland not getting their fair view in taxes that's just breaks
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:33.760]   my heart.
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:36.880]   So yeah they go they looks like each country determines the exact needs of their country
[00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:40.400]   and how the money will be used programs are reviewed and measured for success so it's
[00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:41.400]   complicated.
[00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:46.000]   First that one opens his music on my phone now he puts his red icons on my phone.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.640]   Has anybody complained?
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:54.440]   Maybe yeah maybe this is just them softening us up for like the red beats icon.
[00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:56.720]   Ahhh.
[00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:59.840]   Product red beats.
[00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:07.880]   Moving on ladies and gentlemen apples rock star backed patent war.
[00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:12.240]   We have peace in our times seems to be coming into an end.
[00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:13.240]   Yeah.
[00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:19.160]   Or another way of looking at it is that you know that machine gun that just like kicks
[00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:23.080]   the hell out of your shoulder when you use it they decided to stop using that now.
[00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:28.040]   Rockstar was a company formed to hold the patents that apple and others bought from
[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:34.600]   nordtail apple put there was a Microsoft blackberry Erickson Sony and apple paid four and a half
[00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:38.960]   billion but apples the biggest of the five because they put two point six billion dollars
[00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:40.640]   into the nordtail patents.
[00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:46.400]   They then formed a company called rockstar which is what is euphemistically called a
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:53.840]   non practicing entity or an N P E others might call it a patent role others might say merely
[00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:58.200]   it's a patent defense organization to make sure that the people who invented the products
[00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:02.440]   get paid appropriate or who own the patents from the bought the patents from the people
[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:04.880]   who invented the products.
[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:15.040]   Rockstar had sued many companies including HTC Huawei Samsung that make Android devices.
[00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:22.480]   It seems like apple has lost its desire its will to participate in this in fact there
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:25.320]   was an article this morning I forget it was one of the analysts what an article is wanting
[00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:30.080]   it said that you know given this the lagging sales especially I think the galaxy has five
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:32.560]   numbers were much lower than expected.
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:36.480]   Yeah that apple doesn't see them as the threat that they once saw them as apple might be
[00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:40.640]   declaring victory mission accomplished perhaps.
[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:43.400]   I don't know.
[00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:49.200]   I mean it's I always have seen a parallel between Steve jobs coming back to apple and
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:53.480]   saying you know what this fighting with Microsoft it's not doing us any good whatsoever.
[00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:58.400]   Let's just get rid of this and I'm I have no inside information about this but it just
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:05.640]   seems like there's not this there's not the same sort of just sort of DNA level bile about
[00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:11.880]   Google inside apple that there once was another Tim Cook is large and in charge and I I agree
[00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:15.880]   that if it were a really productive thing for apple to keep doing they keep on doing it
[00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:20.000]   but I think that right now they're realizing that okay we things have simmered down a little
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.760]   bit let's just stop wasting time effort and money on things that really don't matter anymore.
[00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:25.760]   Yeah.
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:33.280]   I think I think it's all it also maybe there's a factor that two years ago Android had yet
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:39.160]   to really distinguish itself the way that they have in 2014 and maybe apple was internally
[00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:42.960]   thinking well look they are just simply copying us step by step by step by step they're always
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:47.160]   to every every version of Android will be a clone of the iPhone and now that it looks
[00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:52.480]   like no there is real diversity of hardware no there these two platforms are almost completely
[00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:58.760]   distinct or as distinct as two different the touchscreen 4.9 inch 4.7 inch phones can possibly
[00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:03.320]   be maybe it's like okay that was that might have been a big worry in 2011 but it's no
[00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:05.960]   longer a worry in 2014 2015.
[00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:11.560]   It wasn't just Google though apple was rock star was also going after Microsoft and yeah
[00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:15.920]   Microsoft was part of rock star but so they were going after other people besides Android
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:24.680]   Cisco in a investor call in last year apparently spoke somewhat cryptically about a resolution
[00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:29.480]   that is quote constructive for the whole industry.
[00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:35.160]   It's also possible that I'm and I'm reading from I am magazine I am magazine which is
[00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:40.760]   from the IP media group and is the kind of the definitive source for this a lot of people
[00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:44.680]   have written about it but they all refer back to this rock star settlement with Google
[00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:50.720]   could mark the beginning of the end of the North tell N P E non practicing entity so
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:58.920]   they reached a great agreement on November 12th with Cisco and Google they may see
[00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:05.760]   that was were these ones were Google famously bid pie they were fitting war with no was
[00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:11.840]   it yeah maybe it was I think it was the constant E.
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:16.280]   No I think it's actually yeah pie was the was the spectrum auction.
[00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:21.000]   Yeah yeah and I think the nor nor tell patents they didn't they didn't really successfully
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:27.080]   a bit against apple and Microsoft so that's good in fact so there's two stories in a row
[00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:31.760]   that you could rightfully say although nobody will oh Steve Jobs would never have allowed
[00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:37.280]   that to happen one jobs was famously against charitable giving right and he wanted it personally
[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:40.080]   was afraid he didn't like it in terms of apple he wanted them to do it personally you
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:45.520]   want a corporate right thing and he was of course the guy who declared through a clear
[00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:50.880]   war against Google and Android he was very mad about it and I think in both cases this
[00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:57.440]   is a kinder gentler apple and but to be fair he might have talked with other people might
[00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:01.920]   have talked him talk him down from there over the past three years if he had to survive
[00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:06.440]   or even him self would have said yeah okay we're done we go well let's find a way let's
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:10.920]   find a way that we can we can basically say that we we did what we we set out to do and
[00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:14.560]   then go home I think you have to eventually and I'm I guarantee you Steve would have come
[00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:21.120]   to the same conclusion see that the cost of this patent war is higher than the benefit
[00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:25.600]   and that's I think pretty obviously what what happened and Samsung's down 30% this year the
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:33.040]   S5 has been a flop and you know maybe they did win maybe they can declare victory but it's
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:36.600]   sort of a flop the way that the I like the like the iPhone 5c was a flop that any other
[00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:40.400]   manufacturer would still love to have that what do they say 12 million units of the galaxy
[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:46.040]   S5 something like that yeah well that's a lot less than the S4 and it's a lot lot lot
[00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:52.160]   less than the iPhone 6 so yeah let's take a break Andy and not coast here Renee Richie
[00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:57.360]   Leo LaPorte we're talking about Apple and Mac and Tashan you know in a something that
[00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:02.720]   we keep waiting for Apple is some home automation solutions Apple home Google's doing it but
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:07.520]   really the solution has to come I think from a third party that unites them all because
[00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:13.120]   the problem is you got this tower of Babel where you have a variety of different devices
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:18.240]   all with different protocols that's why smart things did their Kickstarter project a couple
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:24.680]   years ago raised a lot of money and created this the smart things hub this hub talks to
[00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:31.480]   everything your nest thermostat your drop cam it'll talk to your Schlage locks in fact
[00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:36.240]   if you go to if you go to smartthings.com you could take a look and you'll see all the
[00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:41.440]   different devices and then what's nice is you control the hub and then hence all those
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:47.760]   devices from your iOS device from Android even from Windows phone that's how committed
[00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:51.840]   they are to cross platform smart things just announced that next year you'll also be able
[00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:57.840]   to control and automate a variety of Samsung appliances including refrigerators washers
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:06.480]   dryers air conditioners and even a robotic vacuum so what you do is you put this smart
[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:13.280]   things presence sensor on your in-laws and then when they come in the house the robot
[00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:19.440]   vacuum starts cleaning up and that won't work to be too late by then there's so many things
[00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:23.200]   you can do in fact smart things starts you off with these solution kits that are or the
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:27.600]   home security kits that give you the hub plus the extra smart things sensors to get things
[00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:31.360]   done control and automate your lights and small appliances from wherever you are you
[00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:36.160]   could start you could start dinner from up from your from your office get instant alerts
[00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:40.680]   to prevent a small leak from creating a major flood stay connected to your family by getting
[00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:44.680]   notifications when people come and go you actually could put these little sensors present sensors
[00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:48.920]   in your kids back backs and and you'll know when they come in the house and when they leave the house
[00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:53.000]   you can get notifications if someone you don't know tries to enter the house
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:59.160]   protect valuable items secure areas that are off limits with a smart things app you can easily
[00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:03.560]   see what's happening in every room and with all your connected devices it's like having the home
[00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:07.480]   in the palm of your hand so what they've done is they've they've got these great kits
[00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:12.760]   uh the solution kits that you can pick a thing that you want to do and the solution kit makes
[00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:17.160]   it happen but of course it's completely extensible because now you have the hub you can get more units
[00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:20.920]   you can get other people's units and it'll all work together they also have the home security
[00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:25.560]   kicks a lot of people want to do home security so those are the two choices there now i can get
[00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:32.520]   to get you 10 off any of those kits by going to smartthings.com/twit use the offer code TWIT-10
[00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:39.160]   when you check out 10% off plus free shipping within the u.s smartthings.com/twit

[00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:50.920]   great you know expansion capabilities you get started you do one little thing that's why they're
[00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:55.000]   so smart with these solutions gets you do one little thing now you can easily add more and really
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:59.480]   it takes just a couple of minutes i was able to get this all set up and really almost instantly
[00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:03.800]   so cool smartthings.com/twit
[00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:14.280]   apple stock continues to surge and apple has now crossed the 700 billion dollar market cap
[00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:19.880]   holy moly so glad they listened to all those investors who said they should fire Tim Cook
[00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:25.400]   sorry analysts analysts yeah yeah and listen to me when i said short apple last year boy was i
[00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:29.160]   wrong but see if you listen to me for stock advice you you're making a big mistake
[00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:36.760]   previous record 658 billion in september 2012 apple is now more valuable than ever before
[00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:41.720]   remember they did a seven to one stock split so a lot of times we talk about the the stock as if
[00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:50.840]   it hadn't split and it already hit 800 dollars a share oh my god it's now up to 840 dollars a
[00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:57.880]   share more than 120 dollars for the current share um that's just incredible to put it in perspective
[00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:03.480]   microsoft's market cap and by the way microsoft's number two is 394 billion
[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:11.560]   702 billion 394 billion for microsoft you know the days when when bill gates appeared on looming
[00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:19.080]   over steve jobs on stage i will save apple here's a hundred million dollars instead about your
[00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:24.040]   haunted empire right oh yeah really that does put a haunted empire in perspective doesn't it
[00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:30.280]   um that's just that was that was always just cheap theatrics hundred but that's that's
[00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:33.880]   stock buy was never that big to begin with it was it was more like an act of faith for people who
[00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:38.440]   needed uh silly people who needed uh reassurance that apple was not going to be going away in the
[00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:43.080]   next 90 days i'm not convinced of that i mean didn't didn't they say that it had 90 days of runway
[00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:47.720]   and that gillameleo had practically bankrupted the company this was right when steve just came back
[00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:52.680]   wasn't this money kind of instrumental i people have said it saved apple that you don't think so
[00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:58.520]   i don't i don't think it was the money so much as the the uh there was there was this hammer i
[00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:04.200]   think that was that was over apple's head basically saying that oh microsoft could kill apple if
[00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:09.160]   basically if they if microsoft made it not work with microsoft office and made it not work with
[00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:14.360]   the operating system and the software that powers all american business yeah and so this was at least
[00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:18.200]   if the money i'm sure the the money i'm sure was was a positive thing but i think mostly
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:22.520]   was the assurance that there is another company that has faith that apple is going to you know be
[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:29.320]   a successful enterprise at some point in its future um i don't think this is where this is where i
[00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:34.760]   have to back off and say that i know that this is what i've been told by people who understand
[00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:39.640]   finance of which i am not one of those people uh and i don't i don't pretend to be a business analyst
[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:45.480]   uh but i've had been told by other people that the money was nice but it was mostly the some
[00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:50.200]   they feel as though that was of the entire package that was not the most important part of that
[00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:56.920]   announcement let's put this in perspective if you had bought apple when it went public in late 1980
[00:26:56.920 --> 00:27:07.480]   in current terms the stock uh was around 50 cents a share in 1980 and you know as you go through
[00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:14.760]   the 80s and the 90s a buck you know that's doubling four dollars in august 2000
[00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:23.240]   uh you head up to october to 20 uh 2007 you got a 26 dollars a share a little dip there
[00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:30.360]   then another jump here this is uh 2012 its last peak here we are if you look at the graph and those
[00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:37.320]   are you watching video um it's currently a hundred eighteen dollars a share if you'd bought that share
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:43.240]   when they first went public at 50 cents i'm crying right now Leo is crying
[00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:51.560]   that's pretty amazing yeah but i see what ideally when he when he set up that scenario that's
[00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:57.000]   i buy a thousand shares of apple shock apple apple stock then like as soon as that transaction
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:02.120]   was complete i go outside to get a paper i'm hit by a boss and i'm in a coma for 20 years yeah and
[00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:07.160]   my power of attorney denies my people the ability to check the transaction yeah how i don't think
[00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:11.240]   there's anybody who would have said all those dips and all those little fluctuations that would
[00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:17.160]   have held on to all those shares uh although all that time now but if you had if you'd spent 500
[00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:21.880]   dollars for a thousand shares in 1980 it would be worth a hundred and eighteen thousand dollars
[00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:28.680]   now so there and by the way that's adjusted for the split so we're pretending it didn't split
[00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:34.040]   uh actually we're pretending it well i don't know we're pretending we're just pretending
[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:38.280]   it's a lot of money we're pretending we had this stock that's what we're presenting and what
[00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:44.760]   we have done with it nobody ever goes back nobody ever fantasizes about buying a losing lottery
[00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:51.080]   ticket right you know yeah but but you know but the kid needed braces and i was told that we got
[00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:56.360]   to spend this five thousand dollars on orthodontia you got to say though if you look at this this
[00:28:56.360 --> 00:29:01.880]   this is the graph for the whole life of apple and the big jump is octa when two thousand seven of
[00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:06.520]   course when the iphone comes out and this most recent jump is probably due to the great success
[00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:11.960]   of the iphone in the last quarter and i think built into this is some is excitement about apple
[00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:17.320]   watch right and the buyback means everything that's everything landing at once yeah boy that haunted
[00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:21.400]   empire i'll tell you the ghost of steve jabs way down here in the valley
[00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:29.320]   is really haunting this man ever is over here the value of the short-term opinion yeah it's amazing
[00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:34.360]   it is amazing also i mean i think every time we talk about financials and stuff like that we always
[00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:39.080]   talk about oh isn't it isn't it adorable how the analysts talk about what apple should and shouldn't
[00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:45.320]   be oh isn't that outrage shareholder oh it's oh goodness let's let's let's make some cookies for
[00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:50.440]   them the next time so that every time you get yes you raise your ooh your little fist in the air
[00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:54.600]   it's like when a rabbit can't get into the little plastic bag that has little tiny carrots and it's
[00:29:54.600 --> 00:30:00.120]   just adorable to watch it's like almost anybody who is looking is seeing the numbers seeing the
[00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:05.000]   ears there's it's a binary state you look at how well apple is doing and you say whatever they're
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:09.480]   doing maybe they should keep doing things generally on that shape and we should point out that in
[00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:13.880]   fact it's not merely the stock market i mean that's merely the stock market's opinion and there are
[00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:19.080]   other you know ways you can look at the company and its success that's just what the stock market
[00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:23.640]   says about it and again analyst job is not to inform us is to get their clients to make money and
[00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:27.880]   they you know they'll tell you it's doom so that people sell and their clients can buy more oh yeah
[00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:35.000]   that would be wrong you think also also wasn't the two videos what was it was that the marms
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:39.080]   kursese movie with the linearity caprios the corrupt uh uh investment investment
[00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:44.200]   oh from wall street yeah it had that one line that kind of chilled me because it was so simple and
[00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:48.600]   so true it's that scene in which leon leonard is getting started this business matthew mcconnay
[00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:53.720]   as the seasoned expert is explaining what their business is and he said i will not i will not do
[00:30:53.720 --> 00:31:01.160]   my matthew mcconnay impression because i do not have one and also i've never done dope but uh it
[00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:05.640]   just puts that little oily thing in the bottom of your throat there's a magical event um but he says
[00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:11.160]   that you know if so we we give we uh our client makes money and what they want to do is they want
[00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:15.640]   to cash out and they want to keep that money so that they can maybe retire someday or maybe buy a home
[00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:20.040]   we don't make money unless they keep making transactions so we have to talk them into letting us put
[00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:23.480]   their money someplace else so that we collect the commission then let them put someplace else that
[00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:28.040]   makes the transition so it's like you know what now that i now that i heard that perhaps i'm going
[00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:32.920]   to be all get this industry with a little extra skepticism that i had that i had i had skepticism
[00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:37.000]   before but maybe i'm going to be a little bit more skeptical there's that amazing jim cramer video
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.760]   where he's like well you do is you float a rumor about the iphone being delayed and then everybody
[00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:44.280]   panics and you make money on it and you just can't believe he's telling you all the stuff and you
[00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:49.480]   watch it and you realize what all their advice is exactly what they're doing yeah uh all right
[00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:56.440]   here's a reason to depress the stock price apple four hundred fifty million dollar ebook settlement
[00:31:56.440 --> 00:32:04.680]   gets final court approval so there you have it uh this is the uh case where all the publishers
[00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:11.240]   uh and uh all the companies involved had settled except apple uh publishers uh the department of
[00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:19.320]   justice was upset at apple saying that apples uh ebook pricing uh was um was uh uh unfair
[00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:25.320]   to amazon to amazon right yeah this one you can really fight over we have talked a lot about it
[00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:33.560]   um judge denise cote who was the judge of record in this and many other apple cases
[00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:41.000]   proved what she called a highly unusual agreement apple pay four hundred million dollars directly
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:46.040]   to consumers could be as many as 23 million consumers so you're going to get four bucks
[00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:53.960]   uh if the company is unsuccessful in appealing a ruling so um the publishers will be the five
[00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:59.960]   publishers will be uh splitting a hundred sixty six million dollar no i'm sorry the publishers are
[00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:04.520]   gonna provide a hundred sixty six million dollars for ebook but your purchasers and apple will
[00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:10.040]   uh pour four hundred million into that as well as your authors will still get nothing authors get
[00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:17.800]   nothing because all you did was write the book um where's the monument to the real heroes of publishing
[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:25.000]   the content aggregator that's why i asked the deal still allows apple to appeal um but this
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:31.560]   settlement was on the eve of trial so this is uh this is good news uh the trial is off now although
[00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:37.240]   apple could appeal i don't understand i don't i'm not i'm not a lawyer so on twitter counter notions uh
[00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:41.000]   one of the famous apple analyst who doesn't use his real name was doing a whole bunch of lists of
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.840]   things that judge denise cote could go after apple for now that the e-books thing is held
[00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:52.840]   if the appeals court overturns the settlement and returns the case to judge cote uh apple only
[00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:57.880]   owns always fifty million dollars to consumers and twenty million dollars to lawyers oh my god
[00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:04.520]   that's who makes that on these things um well again as a consumer am i better off today than i was
[00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:08.760]   before this lawsuit and it's hard i'm hard pressed to say i am i mean maybe i am but i haven't noticed
[00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:12.440]   any big difference i just there's just a single vendor amazon who can sell books for whatever they
[00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:16.120]   want right and that doesn't seem in my best interest yeah i don't get it either
[00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:24.040]   uh really true huh is that really true what they're they're multiple vendors
[00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:30.200]   well i'm not of any any significance compared to amazon what is amazon's market but is it like
[00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:36.280]   more than fifty percent i do not know but i know i i know it's and this is only e-books right
[00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:43.240]   yeah i mean it's it's it's similar to it's similar to uh uh android versus ios similar
[00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:48.600]   microsoft versus uh versus every other operating system it's dominant but there's still room for
[00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:52.280]   for for play elsewhere i have the numbers as of uh february
[00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:57.560]   uh oh you see the damage they can do by pulling someone like hatchet off their shelves right
[00:34:57.560 --> 00:35:05.000]   and hatchet did did settle um the proportion of all e-books sold by amazon
[00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:10.840]   well e-books now make up 30 percent of all book sales so 70 percent are still books
[00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:17.000]   but e-books are 30 percent and of those 30 percent amazon has 65 percent market share
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:24.360]   apple and barns and noble account for the rest so it's not completely dominant
[00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:27.080]   amazon's current revenue
[00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:33.720]   uh from books well see they haven't broken out e-books
[00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:37.800]   but from books is two five point two five billion
[00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:45.400]   and there's some these are some good numbers this all comes from a new yorker article in uh
[00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:47.160]   early this year
[00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:52.280]   fifty three percent is the effective discount amazon receives some random house
[00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:56.280]   although i think the argument was their ability to sell it a loss to sell as a loss
[00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:59.720]   leader because they're supported by other businesses when that makes it hard for companies
[00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:03.000]   that don't like apple can compete with that because they also have other business lines but
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.920]   it makes it hard for companies just trying to sell books to compete with them and it also in
[00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:11.080]   the author's view was or the publishers views devalues books so that once the price goes low
[00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:16.360]   people won't let it go back here's a here's a good number that means nothing but penny marshal
[00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:25.960]   members she wrote a uh a memoir called my mother was nuts that nobody bought sold 17,000 copies
[00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:31.720]   however amazon which published it had paid her eight hundred thousand dollars in advance so
[00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:38.360]   effectively she got forty seven dollars a copy for her book and since it was amazon only nope
[00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:41.640]   and one of the reasons she only sold 17,000 is only amazon could sell it
[00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:50.920]   anyway yeah i have a feeling amazon is is more detrimental to the overall
[00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:55.880]   however i continue to buy books through amazon because it sure is convenient do you buy i like
[00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:59.960]   my kindle books i like my kindle do you buy does it either of you buy books from apple's store
[00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:05.400]   i do i buy both because being a canada is weird because sometimes i'll go to amazon and i'll say
[00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:09.080]   i want to buy that wolverine trade paperback and it'll say not available in canada then i'll go
[00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:13.560]   to i books and be able to buy it or i'll go to i books and say i want to gift this to andy and it'll
[00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:18.280]   say sorry you can only gift in canada then i go to kindle and i can gift internationally with kindle so
[00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:24.440]   you have to jump around a lot isn't reasonable i mean we've seen apple take take over music sales
[00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:31.240]   you know the vast majority of of all music sold is sold to right hands is it reasonable to think
[00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:36.840]   that uh the same kind of thing will happen to books that people will stop buying physical books
[00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:42.920]   it's only 30 kindle and other ebooks now is it is it is it conceivable that we'll just see the
[00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:47.720]   end of paper books and everybody buy ebooks and then will it be dominated by one company of the
[00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:52.840]   other or will be split by the two companies i feel like amazon is going to own that market
[00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:57.880]   well i think chiefly because they're doing something that apple isn't doing which is saying we do not
[00:37:57.880 --> 00:38:03.160]   require you to own one of our pieces of hardware to be to be able to read this book that's why i
[00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:10.120]   never buy books off of i books i do the typography is better the app is prettier but i don't like the
[00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:16.120]   the fact that uh i'm not that uh switching to android would have been a hugely complicated
[00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:21.320]   and unattractive proposition if oh no all my music is all my music is locked to i tunes all my books
[00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:26.440]   are locked to i books all my movies are locked to i tunes uh right now really the only thing that's
[00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:31.480]   still in that uh still in the music has escaped the corral but we're still in a world where you can
[00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:36.440]   spend a thousand dollars on books on i books and you have to own an apple device in order to read
[00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:40.440]   that stuff and i don't think that's a good idea for reading a library i think ideally you would
[00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:45.080]   like to be able to buy all these things drm free and i don't think that we should allow ourselves to
[00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:50.440]   be lulled into a sense of complacency that buying books without drm is never a viable proposition
[00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:55.720]   for the publishers to offer but that said i do like the fact that i recommend kindle over
[00:38:55.720 --> 00:39:00.520]   almost everything else chiefly because they are willing to put a reader on anything with a pulse
[00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:06.520]   but it's still drm isn't it it's still drm but it's but it's available on anything and even google
[00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:12.680]   even google google play they they will support devices that are within their best interest to
[00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:17.320]   support but they still have their vendetta again or excuse me they still have their prejudice or
[00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:22.360]   whatever it is against a windows phone yeah so so you won't be able to get a native google play
[00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:27.800]   books reader for for that device can you strip off the drm from uh amazon's e what is it what is
[00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:36.840]   the mr format e-pub there are ways to do that they're not quite legal but there are ways to do that
[00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:43.880]   um but i mean i i i i i i think i think they really embrace something that for that for their own
[00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:48.680]   best interest they embrace something that uh that steve jobs was talking about with iTunes that
[00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:53.240]   were want to make it so easy to buy stuff from our store that you would not want to buy stuff from
[00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:59.960]   anybody else's store and amazon i i would i would uh i have tried these uh these uh ddrm
[00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:05.400]   apps for for kindle i've never felt much of a motivation to use them because well is it going
[00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:09.640]   to be easier than just simply downloading the kindle app for my ipad and then the kindle app for my
[00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:13.560]   android tablet and for this whatever thing no it's not going to be so okay i've academically
[00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:17.640]   proved it works and now i don't have to use it again i'm with andy that i tend to use the amazon
[00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:21.800]   stuff too but i also don't ever want to you know intellectually internally make the mistake that
[00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:26.040]   you know apple is very easy to see vertical lock ins are really easy to see horizontal lock ins
[00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:30.600]   what you know it's the kind that amazon has where yes i can get it for every device as long as they
[00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:34.200]   keep supporting that device but i have no there's nothing to say they won't stop one day in the
[00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:38.280]   future and i can't just take that book and if i decide i like i books better load it into i books
[00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:43.480]   or into whatever reader i want it's still locked into amazon's layer so while they right now support
[00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:48.120]   all the devices i want i would still really really like that the arm free option because music is
[00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:52.040]   the only thing we can get right now that really i can put it up on amazon's locker i can put it up
[00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:56.920]   in in i-tune's match i can put it anywhere i want and that's the only that's the only way to get rid
[00:40:56.920 --> 00:41:01.560]   of the lock completely the problem is that this is not going to go away until we as consumers start
[00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:06.600]   demanding it comixology over the summer started adding drm free comics as an option as matter of
[00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:11.400]   fact they retroactively applied it to whatever books you've already purchased providing that the
[00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:19.240]   publisher has already okayed drm free downloads on that on that title uh so until consumers start
[00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:23.080]   saying oh this is bs i don't want to have this locked into comixology platform i don't want this
[00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:29.080]   locked into the candle platform and they start taking their business elsewhere or until piracy
[00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:37.720]   becomes so well organized that it is just as easy to crab a non drm version of this uh illegally
[00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:42.440]   then it is to simply spend nine dollars or twelve dollars on amazon to buy it on a candle
[00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:49.240]   then that's going to be the state of affairs forever yeah i'm looking at caliber which is one
[00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:54.440]   way to do this is an open source free book converter which will convert by the way there's an amazon
[00:41:54.440 --> 00:42:03.800]   primad at the top of it which you probably would not be happy to know um so it so it looks like it'll
[00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:08.600]   just read the files right off your candle and convert them to some other format so it's not
[00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:14.600]   the strongest drm i don't think that's the aram though it doesn't break drm well last time i looked
[00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:19.480]   at it and what it does is if you have let's say that you've done like a uh uh i send a Kindle from
[00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:25.800]   your from your web browser it will transmogrify those Kindle files to to something else
[00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:30.680]   but it could be wrong that was the last time i really looked at caliber and that was a year and
[00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:35.560]   half two years ago i'm not advocating uh i'd be i'd be i'd be shocked if they've if anybody
[00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:40.920]   public anybody based in the united states published a a app that breaks the digital
[00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:45.640]   millennium copyright act and just said hey here we go enjoy it everybody
[00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:51.560]   hey kids i spent i spent the weekend ripping blu rays that i bought off of off of a my comic book
[00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:56.920]   shop but on off the second hand thing and the it works great but it has to be real setting it up
[00:42:56.920 --> 00:43:01.160]   has to be really complicated because they have to make sure that the stuff that runs a flower of
[00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:06.920]   the of the of the feds has to be located by a company and a server that is not in the united states
[00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:11.880]   of america so once you once you snap these these it's like it really it's it's like scaramanda's
[00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:16.280]   gun from the man with a golden gun it's like hey everybody here's my gold fountain pen and
[00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:21.480]   here's my cigarette case and here's my lighter and here's my cufflink and if you want to snap them
[00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:26.840]   together and make a working gun i suppose you could do that but we're really just selling you a pen
[00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:31.480]   and a cigarette case and instructions for how to snap them together into a working gun hey we're
[00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:40.200]   our hands are clean we are going to take a break when we come back uh some interesting results uh
[00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:47.160]   on color accuracy on the iphone versus other phones but first a word from our friends at personal
[00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:53.080]   capital love personal capital it is uh fact it was the founder ed Harris who first told me
[00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:57.640]   about personal capital when he was on our show triangulation he's a former CEO pay pallet do it
[00:43:57.640 --> 00:44:02.440]   we're talking about finance and money and uh he said i've got this thing we're going to do
[00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:05.880]   called personal capital i signed up for it then and i've been a member for two years now and i
[00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:12.200]   love it it's free it's secure it's easy to set up and it solves two problems that people have with
[00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:15.880]   keeping track of their investments the first of course is that everything's on different accounts
[00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:22.440]   your bank account different website new password your stocks your 401k i have 401k is from three
[00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:27.240]   previous employers all on different sites with different passwords your loans your mortgages it's
[00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:32.840]   all in spread out all out all over the place with personal capital it co-co-co-less is all this
[00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:39.560]   stuff into a single page so you can see exactly how you're doing very quickly on your desktop on
[00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:45.800]   your phone on your laptop on your tablet anywhere and then of course there's the issue of how are
[00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:50.680]   you managing your money are you doing it yourself could be a bad idea if you're using a manager are
[00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:57.080]   you paying that person too much or the or the the broker the online broker too much personal capital
[00:44:57.080 --> 00:45:03.240]   makes it very simple to see where your stuff is to see how it's doing to manage it and to find out
[00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:07.640]   if you're overpaying for the advice you could even get tailored advice from personal capital on
[00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:13.800]   optimizing your investments so stop overpaying at fees try personal capital it's free personal

[00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:58.280]   display mate uh the folks who do these um not as much as a nantec but more than me not as much as a
[00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:02.680]   man at the antec more than you so what an antec says is probably is the definitive source although
[00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:08.920]   with an ant gone and brine krug gone to their best people i don't know whether to trust an antec
[00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:14.440]   still or not yeah ryan is awesome the new editor in chief is really good okay yeah boy that if you
[00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:18.600]   say that because you're a competitor so if you say that it must be true i don't feel
[00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:23.080]   miscompet i mean they they i i they do a completely different stuff from almost every other like
[00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:29.080]   they're so good yeah i i i grew i i think rene we're nay and i i'm probably on the same page where we're
[00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:37.080]   we love dx i love dx olives i love an ant because i don't i don't understand at a deep level how cp
[00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:42.440]   use our architected and hot the technologies about creating cp use so i think it's very very
[00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:47.880]   valuable to say and let's see what is what is what about the aa chip let's see what an ant has to say
[00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:52.040]   yeah i know i do exactly the same thing and then and then whenever and of course i'm always careful
[00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:55.640]   when i write about it and say oh here's what an antec has to say here's what dxo says about this image
[00:46:55.640 --> 00:47:00.840]   sensor uh so there's there's competition but then there's oh thank goodness for this resource that
[00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:05.400]   they provide yeah i don't think either and you have twenty grand worth of optical test equipment
[00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:10.600]   but now i have to say just say the post-grad engineering degrees that are that are required
[00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:17.080]   display mate uh make software that people use to calibrate monitors to test monitors and uh
[00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:24.280]   their president raman sonara uh will publish articles about color accuracy on displays all the
[00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:29.240]   time and i feel like these guys are paying attention like dya you know dxo mark sells software so
[00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:36.120]   i you know dxo and display mate maybe they're not completely independent journalists like an
[00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:42.360]   antec but as you say who has the equipment to do this anyway yeah um and so i feel like these are
[00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:48.840]   you know these charts are are self-explanatory they talk about display color accuracy that is
[00:47:48.840 --> 00:47:54.680]   that is an issue of how accurate you know a blue is a blue blue is the red red then there's gamut
[00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:59.720]   which is the range of colors that can be displayed of course no display can do everything the eye
[00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:04.520]   can see you know people say oh it's got four billion colors that's more than you but is it but what's
[00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:10.280]   the gamut and that's what matters is the range of colors and then things like how well it does uh
[00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:17.320]   skin tones and things like that so they do these these shootouts um and so they done recently is
[00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:25.960]   shoot out from the iphone six plus the galaxy note four the air two and uh the surface pro three
[00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:32.040]   and there you know it's probably worth reading the whole thing and looking at all these tables
[00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:40.120]   although uh it's hard to you know take a simple takeaway from this but i will i will boil it down
[00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:49.240]   i guess to um the best display color right now most accurate uh an absolute color accuracy is not
[00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:56.280]   the iphone but the galaxy note four and the second place is the microsoft surface pro three
[00:48:56.280 --> 00:49:06.280]   uh with closely tied with the galaxy tab s 10.5 the iphone fairly far and the ipad air fairly
[00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:13.880]   far down in terms of accuracy skin tone accuracy organic color accuracy blue region color accuracy
[00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:18.360]   uh you know but does better with skin tone it does better with organic color
[00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:22.920]   that's terrible with blue white point accuracy very poor
[00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:32.840]   so uh you disagree with these or um agree and disagree i mean the then it's it's i react the
[00:49:32.840 --> 00:49:38.600]   same way it's when i react to uh dxos score of the iphone six plus is the best uh camera camera
[00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:43.960]   sensor in any phone up there it's good the graphs are the if the math or their findings are incorrect
[00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:47.960]   there are other nerds out there with the same engineering degrees who will prove them wrong
[00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:52.840]   it's just that what i don't like is when people take this information and try to extrapolate out
[00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:57.960]   of it by saying that oh well that means that the the samsung galaxy s4 it's gonna oh it's gonna
[00:49:57.960 --> 00:50:02.680]   look so much better than the pictures that you're gonna look at uh on your iphone six like well
[00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:07.640]   no that's not necessarily true because all you're looking at are graphs and where those points fall
[00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:12.600]   among those graphs um when it especially when it comes down to something as subjective as
[00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:17.960]   how good is this photo that this camera has taken and how good does this image or this video look
[00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:23.560]   on this display because if someone tells you that i think that the iphone six display looks
[00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:28.120]   fantastic you're not allowed to then say nah you're stupid i can prove to you that you don't
[00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:33.560]   prefer this display see look at this graph look at what this triangle is and amongst that graph so
[00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:38.680]   it's valuable as far as it goes but that's only one part of the story and this is part of this part
[00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:43.960]   of this i had had one of those uh uh eat my own dog food sort of moments earlier this year when i
[00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:48.520]   was buying my camera where i was spending a lot of time i was it was between three or four different
[00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:53.480]   models that i was having a hard time choosing between i kind of had the instinct that the oem
[00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:58.600]   the oempo mde m1 was going to be the one for me but i was going to looking at all the all the uh
[00:50:58.600 --> 00:51:03.400]   the technical explanations of the differences between the image sensors on dxo and the scores
[00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:09.000]   that dxo mark was giving for each one of them and i could have i was almost along myself to tell
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:14.600]   myself that no no no the fuji takes better pictures than the the x100 takes better pictures than the
[00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:22.280]   olympus see look at this graph and i i had to sort of walk away from it for two days to think about
[00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:27.240]   the totality of the experience that a camera provides and all the things outside of this what
[00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:32.280]   they're only looking at this little wafer of millions and millions of transistors to tell you about how
[00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:36.680]   these millions and millions of transistors interact whereas the difference between the olympus and the
[00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:43.880]   fuji was that the olympus has this amazing five-access digital image to excuse me optical image stabilization
[00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:48.600]   that compensates for pretty much whatever you want to whatever your failings you think it has
[00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:52.760]   that's why i think it's the same thing here i think it's i think it's significant that someone is coming
[00:51:52.760 --> 00:51:58.200]   up with empirical mathematical evidence that one display is better than the other but i don't think
[00:51:58.200 --> 00:52:03.240]   anybody's going to be buying an ipad instead of a excuse me a surface three instead of an ipad or
[00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:07.960]   macbook air because of this score that came out the only thing that's kind of interesting about
[00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:13.960]   it is that if it points to anything it points to the need for apple to at least want to i'm sure
[00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:18.360]   that they want to be able to say that we not only have the best pursuit best perceptive screen we
[00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:23.080]   also have the best technical screen uh and so if that means that that will put more money into
[00:52:23.080 --> 00:52:27.240]   whatever department has to work on that then that that the guess what they just got upgraded from
[00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:32.440]   generic cola to name brand coke and pepsi in the break room i have i do have to say that that's
[00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:37.640]   obviously not the reason you would choose one phone or the other it's one of uh many factors but i
[00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:43.320]   do have to say the note for if you can bear sam san and you can bear the note the note for screen
[00:52:43.320 --> 00:52:48.200]   is and i have had i've played with all these phones consistently the best looking screen and
[00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:53.000]   that's a big just departure for sam san because these uh super amoled displays have traditionally
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:58.200]   not been very color accurate yeah well also also the difference is that stunning display i got it
[00:52:58.200 --> 00:53:03.640]   yeah it is it is i i have been using both of them for the past three four weeks uh and i do think
[00:53:03.640 --> 00:53:08.040]   it's a gorgeous gorgeous display uh and one of the things that keeps coming up whenever people talk
[00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:12.760]   about displays in a technical way that well you only you're only responding to the sam san display
[00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:17.320]   because it's more higher contrast and and like deeper colors and it's like it's like when the when
[00:53:17.320 --> 00:53:22.360]   mcdonald's puts more salt and spices into the meats and yes but people like salt and spices that's
[00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:27.480]   why that's why people like this cheeseburger very very much there's a couple of other things that
[00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:32.120]   are worth considering here too one is that uh what are the specific technologies good for like for
[00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:36.120]   example dual domain pixels does they don't make much of a difference if you're staring straight at a
[00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:40.040]   phone but if the phones get bigger and you want people sitting next to you then it helps improve
[00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:45.000]   the way that people next to you see the screen or the new polarization filter if you're wearing
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:49.080]   sunglasses you know if you're not wearing sunglasses makes no difference if you're wearing sunglasses
[00:53:49.080 --> 00:53:53.320]   then it stops the interference pattern and the other thing is that uh the technology itself
[00:53:53.320 --> 00:53:56.680]   isn't an indicator the way and you said because it also depends quite often like
[00:53:56.680 --> 00:54:00.840]   amazon had much better screens in their tablets before apple did because that technology just
[00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:05.480]   wouldn't scale yet and you bought as many screens as as amazon did it was fine but you couldn't put
[00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:10.040]   those on ipads because you need way more than the technology could provide so it's a very delicate
[00:54:10.040 --> 00:54:14.840]   sort of balancing act my my thinking is just that as long as they're close to each other i'm happy
[00:54:14.840 --> 00:54:19.800]   because it means everyone is being pushed the ipad mini 3 it still has a much worse screen than the
[00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:24.120]   than the regular ipad and i hope stuff like this puts pressure on apple to give it that laminated
[00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:29.080]   display and that full color gamut faster because when something lags behind uh the competition is
[00:54:29.080 --> 00:54:33.000]   good for it when something is is raging ahead it means the competitors will catch up and drive
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:37.720]   them even more forward so i like these tests just so much as it drives the entire industry forward
[00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:43.720]   yeah i will i will say having i'm in like deep test mode down the surface 3 i love the screen on
[00:54:43.720 --> 00:54:49.080]   the surface 3 it is just people are raving about it yeah i mean i've got in front of me right now
[00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:55.720]   my show notes and i i my daily driver is a macbook pro retina that i bought late at the last last
[00:54:55.720 --> 00:55:02.280]   winner and so that's no slouch either but yikes it's like this could be this it's it's not something
[00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:05.640]   you there this is something that i keep coming i keep coming back to that there's
[00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:10.520]   better and then there's better that you only notice when you have two things side by side
[00:55:10.520 --> 00:55:14.760]   but yeah the surface 3 screen is just better yeah can't get the tiles off mine
[00:55:14.760 --> 00:55:20.680]   i have to say uh there's some really wonky stuff about touch whiz and everything but
[00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:25.480]   yeah it is sometimes the case that the screen is so good that you just go i'm gonna give up i'm
[00:55:25.480 --> 00:55:30.600]   gonna sacrifice other things because i just it's just it's just doesn't really is like the charlie
[00:55:30.600 --> 00:55:35.800]   brown of like phone makers where like he will be like he will be like 10 feet away from the finish
[00:55:35.800 --> 00:55:40.040]   line about to win the win the the big road race for the first time and finally win something
[00:55:40.040 --> 00:55:44.440]   and he'll find a way to oh i'm supposed to turn off this way not go that way it just don't just
[00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:49.720]   give a stock android it's fine it'll be so much but no don't try don't do anything it's when i'm
[00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:54.360]   testing the cameras for instance this conceivably has one of the best cameras that you can buy in
[00:55:54.360 --> 00:56:00.520]   a phone and i include the iPhone 6 but it it tries to help you out in ways that make it the one of the
[00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:05.160]   most annoying cameras to possibly use it's like i had to reshoot a whole test sequence because
[00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:10.760]   it was taking terrible pictures because it kept trying to be adaptive and improve things for me
[00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:16.360]   when okay i turn off this turn off that turn off that turn off this that's why it over sharpens
[00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:20.680]   death really that over sharpens it's it goes to really weird low light modes where it starts
[00:56:20.680 --> 00:56:25.240]   warning you please i'm gonna use a super super low shutter speed so hold your hold you the phone
[00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:29.640]   really really steady and it's never gonna be able to get a good good sharp image like that
[00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:33.960]   it's like i i think that you almost have to do two different reviews of any samsung device
[00:56:33.960 --> 00:56:37.560]   you have to review the version the people are paying two hundred dollars for with contract
[00:56:37.560 --> 00:56:41.800]   and then you have to review the seven hundred dollar one google play google experience one
[00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:47.240]   because boy are those if you buy it with stock android it is such a competitive phone with
[00:56:47.240 --> 00:56:51.720]   absolutely everything out there once you put touch whiz on it it's not a bad phone but it's
[00:56:51.720 --> 00:56:57.800]   not as good a phone as it could possibly be i am uh i'm kind of hoping that uh i can get a
[00:56:58.600 --> 00:57:04.360]   generic ram on it's no for it uh although you know there is a lot of touch in it uh you know
[00:57:04.360 --> 00:57:09.560]   using the the stylist that will go away a lot of features that will go away but boy the image
[00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:15.080]   quality is pretty dramatic it's so gorgeous that's the same complaint i was about to have
[00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:19.640]   because i think that when i'm disappointed with the display it's because it really is adding too
[00:57:19.640 --> 00:57:24.440]   much salt adding too much spices adding too much fat to the recipe when if you just let the display
[00:57:24.440 --> 00:57:29.960]   do what it's supposed to do it'll do fine there are uh don't don't read the comments on that article
[00:57:29.960 --> 00:57:36.120]   about the screen uh this references because oh my god it is like it is like i don't know that there
[00:57:36.120 --> 00:57:41.480]   are soccer hooligans that write about that are shitting phones but we got the apple soccer hooligans
[00:57:41.480 --> 00:57:47.000]   and we got the samsung soccer hooligans uh but they that there is a good point raised which is that
[00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:51.560]   the screen does have several different modes you can set manually if you want right this note
[00:57:51.560 --> 00:57:55.720]   four has the special thing where we'll try to figure out that oh well you're looking at you're in the
[00:57:55.720 --> 00:58:00.120]   gallery photos app so i'm gonna fine-tune it so that photos look really good you're now not you
[00:58:00.120 --> 00:58:03.480]   now you're now just scrolling through a list so i'm gonna fine-tune it so that user and i'm gonna
[00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:08.840]   make the colors bolder and sharper and brighter so that it's easier to navigate apps um and i think
[00:58:08.840 --> 00:58:12.520]   there was some question as to what mode that they were testing in when they were completed these
[00:58:12.520 --> 00:58:16.440]   tests but i'm sure that they made it a fair uh playing ground for everybody because i don't think
[00:58:16.440 --> 00:58:23.320]   that this company has the reputation for being dopes they use the uh basic screen mode which is
[00:58:23.320 --> 00:58:27.480]   not the adaptive mode so there's four display there's adaptive display amoled cinema
[00:58:27.480 --> 00:58:32.520]   which is i don't know how these are different amoled photo which is a little bit more muted
[00:58:32.520 --> 00:58:37.800]   and then basic and they they say they use the basic screen mode but man old ed is getting so
[00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:43.000]   amoled is getting so much better i have to say yeah even the new tv's are looking fantastic yeah
[00:58:43.880 --> 00:58:47.880]   um anyway it's hard for me to put this phone down as much as i want to hate it
[00:58:47.880 --> 00:58:55.320]   it's our now let me let me point out this article uh from ole begerman who is an ios developer he
[00:58:55.320 --> 00:59:01.400]   calls it iphone six plus pixel peeping and rene i'm gonna have to defer to you on this one because i
[00:59:01.400 --> 00:59:06.760]   did not realize this it is a very he says the iphone six plus rent plus this is the big one
[00:59:06.760 --> 00:59:13.480]   renders things differently than every other ios device to date to developers which he is the
[00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:17.480]   device exposes a screen rectangle of four fourteen by seven thirty six
[00:59:17.480 --> 00:59:25.240]   which the system renders at three times scale into a backing store not a non-screen display but
[00:59:25.240 --> 00:59:29.960]   a backing store of twelve forty two by twenty two oh eight now of course it's a nineteen twenty
[00:59:29.960 --> 00:59:35.080]   by ten eight display so the backing store is then and this i always thought there's a bad idea
[00:59:35.080 --> 00:59:40.840]   down sampled by thirteen percent to the native resolution in other words
[00:59:41.880 --> 00:59:48.600]   um you know normally when you have a display the ideal resolution is the native resolution
[00:59:48.600 --> 00:59:54.920]   dot for dot on the display that's what you want to do but that's not what uh apple is doing with
[00:59:54.920 --> 01:00:01.560]   this in fact they're downscaling which traditionally will give you some blurring and some weird artifacts
[01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:08.920]   now you he says that in practice the resolution is so high that i haven't noticed this but he did
[01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:15.560]   take some up close screenshots to give you uh an example and what he's done is he's
[01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:23.080]   created a grid of vertical green hair lines with varying spacing on a black background
[01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:29.640]   now and this is perfect on the on the screen and and this is at twelve forty two by twenty two oh eight
[01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:37.400]   so um this is every line of course if you're watching our video it's it's heavily compressed
[01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:43.160]   so you won't see this but every line on this uh is is uh exactly right and you can see i can even
[01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:48.120]   see on our tv moirang over here on the left which is in fact not the case uh if you so you should
[01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:56.120]   read the article at oleb.net then he talks about uh the rendered three three times scale and then
[01:00:56.120 --> 01:01:01.080]   down sampling and this is a photo of the screen and you see i think you can see clearly the artifacting
[01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:11.400]   on these lines uh because of the down sampling now do you see that on screen probably not but i
[01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:16.200]   think it could it could impact the iphone six plus screen in the sense it might make you feel like
[01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:22.920]   it's not as crisp as it could be so rene what do you think so i mean this was this is a
[01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:27.720]   it was noticeable to everybody before apps updated because they would up sample them from the old
[01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:32.520]   resolution that was really bad yeah i did notice that by the way this is an iphone five
[01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:37.880]   which is rendered at two x and so you don't get any of the images image issues because you don't
[01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:41.560]   it's rendered at two x and displayed at two x right no scaling it's rendered at this there's no
[01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:47.480]   scaling so that's an iphone five that's a six plus and and mentally you had to zoom in a lot to
[01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:51.960]   to see this so i mean if you're loram britter you will probably notice this and it might drive you
[01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:56.440]   crazy there's there not everyone is going to notice this and there's a history of of different
[01:01:56.440 --> 01:02:00.040]   display technologies and who can notice them and who can't because it's just not something that
[01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:04.040]   everybody pays attention to and not every not everybody can actually notice the difference
[01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:08.040]   some people will see a slight flickering when they when they move horizontally because
[01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:12.760]   it changes which pixels are on and off differently because of the the the scaling right for most
[01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:17.400]   people the resolution is so high that's why the density is so high over 400 dpi that you won't
[01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:21.960]   notice any difference the advantage to the way apple did it is that they went to at they could
[01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:27.320]   have gone to 1080p and just created an arbitrary screen target for developers now but that's not
[01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:31.560]   very future proof by going to at three x right now it means that one day when they get a display
[01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:36.680]   that has the logical resolution of the frame buffer it'll be perfect it'll be exact and developers
[01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:41.720]   won't have to you know dish the 1080p resolution and start making three x assets there were some
[01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:45.640]   rumors that apple was trying to get a display of that density in the iphone six plus and they just
[01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:50.680]   couldn't do it so they went to plan b which is 1080p but whether that's true or not next year of the
[01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:55.400]   year after the year after that there will be an at three x native display and all of the apps built
[01:02:55.400 --> 01:03:00.600]   for it will be fine you can target 1080p today if you use open gl they'll let you call directly
[01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:06.920]   you can make a 1024 I mean a 1080p image if you if you know open gl well enough and you really
[01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:10.760]   really want to go to the trouble of doing it but for most people it's there's absolutely no
[01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:14.280]   difference you've got to break out the macro the way he did to really notice those kinds of things
[01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:21.480]   right all right so there are people in the chat room and say they can't see it um there
[01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:24.600]   yeah there's a percentage of people who can it's back when they had those old i forget that screen
[01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:28.120]   technology but you know some people can always see small disturbances depends on the acuity of
[01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:33.400]   your vision yeah and your sensitivity to movement I think you while you may not I think you may
[01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:39.960]   not notice it exactly but you may say is I mean it is certainly not desirable to do that 13%
[01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:47.160]   scaling the down sample and it's not well I can't like not desirable as you go to I mean it's
[01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:51.640]   the tension between that and making adaptive ui's because you want developers to be able
[01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:54.920]   to target and this is the problem everyone has to face you have fragments on android and other
[01:03:54.920 --> 01:04:00.040]   things webOS tried to do it everyone has to find a way to sort of paint variable size screens and
[01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:03.960]   they're doing it on the Mac as well and they have very good scalars that try to identify objects
[01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:09.480]   and make those objects as crisp as possible and not just do one-to-one pixel down sampling um so
[01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:12.920]   it is just a challenge and it is you know the awkward teenage years of display is going to
[01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:18.680]   actually looks fine right uh it's a 1080p video will be rendered at 1080p so that'll always look
[01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:23.320]   fine um I believe games will be painted at the same resolution especially if they're using open
[01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:28.520]   GL or metal or something like that it's really only interface elements like single pixel horizontal
[01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:35.240]   or vertical lines that you'll see to notice that stuff yeah so yeah I mean to me the text on the
[01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:39.640]   6 plus looks really really crisp because some people can notice one frame being dropped from
[01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:47.160]   a 60 frame percent video some people are magic yeah yeah yeah but it may contribute to the to me
[01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:53.080]   apparent superiority of the note for screen I mean it may contribute to that I don't know yeah
[01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:58.120]   I mean I was assuming there's no scaling on the note well yeah actually I don't know that's a
[01:04:58.120 --> 01:05:05.640]   good question the note is 2560 by 1440 it's ridiculous and who knows if that's yeah there was a
[01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:12.440]   sharp panel being showed off that was 700 dpi in japan recently come on come on man you can't
[01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:16.920]   tell the difference silly and then there's this use you know I'm having all sorts of wi-fi issues
[01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:20.600]   on this note for is probably people have noticed things aren't loading uh and I haven't had that
[01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:25.960]   trouble on the other phone so which is more important that your phone is fast and works or that its
[01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:30.120]   screen looks great yeah that's the most frustrating thing right now with all these devices the operating
[01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:34.040]   systems are complex enough and all our personal setups are so different that a small percentage of
[01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:38.280]   people are have wi-fi issues on every version of iOS and every update a small percentage of people
[01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:43.800]   have almost every issue and almost every platform and it's not everybody right I don't know I
[01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:51.240]   I just I raise these things because you should know right it was another great article someone took
[01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:56.440]   a microscope to the iPhone 6 display to see why it was because the iPhone 5s was laminated as well
[01:05:56.440 --> 01:06:01.160]   but the iPhone 6 looks even better and it turns out the pixels are even closer to the surface even
[01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:06.440]   with the um the anti-glare coating and the uh the polarization there's the screen itself is
[01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:10.280]   much thinner so the pixels look even closer and a lot of people notice that now and they go back
[01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:14.280]   to a fly of s and say oh I'm looking through a piece of glass yeah it's horrible and go back
[01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:29.560]   um iPhone 6 drives huge downloads in october and tributor writing but marketing costs finally fall
[01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:36.040]   slightly this is the cost per loyal user index I don't know what the hell Dean Takahashi writing
[01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:41.400]   into tell me the fine I don't know what this is app and game makers this is from a company called
[01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:50.040]   fixu fiksu in october the launch of the iPhone 6 and iOS 8 drove record download volumes for the
[01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:58.040]   most popular apps okay on top of that the cost of acquiring users dipped a little that's probably
[01:06:58.040 --> 01:07:04.680]   you know just math but as the holiday see you whoops that's the cost of a disloyal user Leo
[01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:10.680]   churn is expensive right if you're if you pay a certain amount of money to market
[01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:18.040]   to somebody and they sign up you know Netflix you know pays whatever I don't know 50 bucks
[01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:24.920]   to get a new subscription you want to keep that person for a year so that you can you know pay
[01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:29.560]   off the cost of acquiring them and then get some money out of them if they stop if they drop
[01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:34.040]   Netflix in two months that's called churn and that means it costs you more to get the user
[01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:38.600]   than it did the key you know the you lost attention is cheaper than acquisition there thank you for
[01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:48.360]   making that much clearer um and then there's the fixu cost per launch index the blue is iOS the
[01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:54.440]   green is android obviously costs a little more to market on iOS because there's a lot more choices
[01:07:54.680 --> 01:08:00.200]   brands and big companies spend a lot of money to get attention for their games and apps that
[01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:06.120]   increases the cost of acquiring users via advertising on mobile devices and so that's gone up steadily
[01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:17.720]   so many graphs i don't know what it means what is it oh you want another one here's the cpi index
[01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:24.600]   the cost per launch index which which tracks the cost of driving engagement from mobile users that
[01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:30.680]   grew 24 percent from september to 26 cents in october up 39 percent from a year ago
[01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:39.800]   it sounds like a curse word it's all the ios cost per install went up to a dollar 46
[01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:46.040]   so that's the that's the 50 dollars i was talking about with the netflix example the cost to get a
[01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:51.560]   user install your game is roughly a dollar 46 see this is a good to know though when you say oh i
[01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:56.040]   think shouldn't cost 99 cents what's it worth it cost them about 46 to get you to download it
[01:08:56.040 --> 01:09:02.600]   the 99 cents take out apples 30 percent that's 66 cents they get that's not gonna cover it
[01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:12.280]   that's why in app purchases are so popular yep they track 3.5 billion app installs
[01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:21.480]   and 5.4 trillion marketing events across 1.7 billion devices sounds like fixu knows
[01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:31.080]   sounds like they're really busy they're very busy the cost per loyal user or cplu on android was
[01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:42.120]   10 cents in october cheap they're cheap and how loyal are they i don't know wow that's wild i don't
[01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:46.440]   know what these numbers are but apparently app developers care a lot about this kind of stuff
[01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:50.280]   you're like i need horris dead you to translate yeah horris what's he's going on there
[01:09:50.280 --> 01:09:57.640]   it is fairly simple you only pay the attention to the numbers it would be clear what you feel
[01:09:57.640 --> 01:10:05.000]   can you reduce it to a easily repeatable buzzword but someone with interesting hair can then talk
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:11.160]   about doing a TED talk are you talking about what is his name shingy i'm i'm specifically not talking
[01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:16.520]   about shingy because i am sick and tired of people giving shingy crap i'm tired of it why because i
[01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:25.560]   think it's i i see a i see a i don't know about you but at one point i went to junior high school okay
[01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:30.520]   and i remember like all you have to do is like one kid shows up this wasn't me but like you show up
[01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:35.960]   in a bowler hat just wants a goop for one thing and suddenly everybody says okay we're gonna make fun
[01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:41.560]   of this kid for the next five years and like only because we remember how the one time he wore the
[01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:45.320]   bowler hat we're not going to know about we're not going to ask about like what he thinks what he
[01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:49.880]   feels does he take his library books back back on time does he does he take good care of his dog
[01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:56.040]   no no no we're just gonna yes see and i think he i think that's how he looks but let's not make fun
[01:10:56.040 --> 01:11:01.320]   of someone because of how they look i think he was born that way and he is it different i think i
[01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:07.320]   think the problem is that people don't listen to what i i i don't think i've ever read an article
[01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:13.720]   about him that actually said in substance what he does what his philosophies are and what really
[01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:18.360]   moves and drives oh okay so we had to read this new article it's so well i've read the new yorker
[01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:22.840]   article and it talks about oh look he he went in and he redesigned his bosses he bought his boss's
[01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:27.160]   office and oh look he had a conversation which he talked about this thing that he this this is
[01:11:27.160 --> 01:11:32.440]   is interesting this odd idea that he had run on his ipad mini during a long long flight
[01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:38.120]   and it's like what you could make it just a silly a video excuse me almost as silly almost a silly
[01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:44.120]   video about johnny i've yeah okay or about so you know it's like he's obsessed with what kinds
[01:11:44.120 --> 01:11:48.760]   of metal to us it's like it's it's a luminance woulder steel for him he's he spent like a million
[01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:53.640]   dollars of apples money trying to figure out what kind of aluminum right god i've shipped an
[01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:58.120]   iPhone i'm just waiting for you know aol to ship an iphone singing again you know he's their digital
[01:11:58.120 --> 01:12:04.760]   profiting i'm i'm i'm i'm saying that i'm i'm i'm i will define i will defend anybody with
[01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:09.400]   interesting hair from people who seem to be complaining mostly that he has interesting hair
[01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:14.200]   not with the right right article about here is what his job actually is an aol here is how he has
[01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:20.840]   failed to do that job or no i know he's doing his job he must be doing something right i'm saying
[01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:26.680]   that i could i could never i if i had to justify like my sideburns if i had to justify you know
[01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:31.320]   anything else today then i could not do that i would i would like to hope that people think that
[01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:35.240]   i'm an idiot for the things that i say and believe not because of things that i have growing out of
[01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:39.400]   my head that's all so if you think about it video will be everywhere and the experience of it will
[01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:44.440]   be everywhere even with things like wearables but the thing about wearables today is it feels like
[01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:48.920]   if i wear all my wearables by the way i look like a tribal leader that's one got one but what i'm
[01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:53.880]   seeing in the future what's going on right now is multiple use cases i just love him you know i
[01:12:53.880 --> 01:13:01.400]   i want to hug the man he gets a lot of crap fruit that really you're right it's all it's about
[01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:06.360]   there by the way he does say he does talk in the new yorker article about the hair and how he gets
[01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:12.440]   it that way and how long it takes him to get it that way so he's aware of the hair you know but
[01:13:12.440 --> 01:13:17.400]   like did they did they did he did he did he was in a four-hour interview which he spends three
[01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:21.400]   hours three and a half hours talking about like here's here's another set of grass free and here's
[01:13:21.400 --> 01:13:24.440]   another deflection point based on blah blah blah you know what if you there's an interesting story
[01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:28.680]   about lady Anna that that comes into this if he were working for a different company then he
[01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:32.040]   asked me the one question about his hair so oh yeah well it takes less time than you think right and
[01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:38.120]   now it's all about his hair i agree that's the hook if it were anybody with a a o l the problem is
[01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:42.360]   a well it's a little credibility that uh you kind of want to see he was at google it'd be fantastic
[01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:47.160]   and we go oh look at this amazing guy oh oh so oh so now we're adding the kick company when it's
[01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:53.240]   down so it's an asthmatic kid who wore bowler hat that one time sir gay gets it for his federally
[01:13:53.240 --> 01:14:00.120]   oh it could be worse he could be working for uber people nice they would call him the uber goober
[01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:08.200]   if he worked for uber uber guru apple has relabeled the free buttons on the uh iTunes and mac app store
[01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:14.680]   to get just in case if you were looking to the eu that's the eu they said uh and they may google
[01:14:14.680 --> 01:14:18.760]   do the same thing they said you know what if something's free but has in-app purchases you really
[01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:27.720]   shouldn't call it free so get it's interesting now because you have the price tag on and on paid
[01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:32.360]   apps and then you have get on free or free you know with in-app purchase subscription apps you press
[01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:37.160]   the pay the uh pay button sorry the price tag and it says buy you press the get button and it's
[01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:41.560]   changes to install right and you know i understand that the eu wants them to change stuff but as a
[01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:46.360]   user experience thing it's still yeah like if i just gave someone who wasn't familiar with this
[01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:50.680]   stuff one you know a google play or an app store device i still don't know if they successfully
[01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:55.240]   navigate and understand the nuances of yeah how the how the the buying what are google's because
[01:14:55.240 --> 01:15:02.280]   google was the first to change there let me just look at apps and see um let's see i'm sure some
[01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:09.960]   of these heavy nap uh purchases well it says free but doesn't say free on the button it says
[01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:16.840]   install on the button they still talk about free apps candy crushed soda saga that's certainly
[01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:22.040]   getting that purchases they listed in the details um if you know they have to now they say it's gonna
[01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:27.400]   have to save the price range of the lowest and highest cost item uh in-app purchases but if you're
[01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:30.680]   looking for absolutely free apps that don't have any strings attached this still makes it no
[01:15:30.680 --> 01:15:35.560]   easier to find those no i think you're right and and google doesn't say free they say
[01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:39.880]   oh yeah a little print underneath the install button in app which they've been saying that for
[01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:45.560]   a while now what they added recently is if you go into the the more details about it it has a little
[01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:50.440]   column for right kind of price range but apple's done that too yeah apple has underneath the title
[01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:55.400]   the in-app purchase text yeah and they have i i think what they're worried about i think mostly
[01:15:55.400 --> 01:16:01.160]   is kids right um i think they're worried about yeah i mean they're worried about it all having
[01:16:01.160 --> 01:16:05.880]   very well yeah i mean people having bad experiences and they're not becoming less frequent as time
[01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:11.000]   goes by right um and i don't think that's going to change that either frankly but a little extra
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:16.680]   transparency i think is welcome yeah i think i think that what what can this is not something that was
[01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:22.600]   uh this is not a consumer to apple relationship because this was not the mediated by apple themselves
[01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:27.960]   but i think that that might be a bad consumer experience that apple would be very very interested
[01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:32.920]   in solving because there are people that just did not know that it was possible for their their
[01:16:32.920 --> 01:16:38.920]   kid found a way despite whatever fail saves that apple or or or google or whoever put into this
[01:16:38.920 --> 01:16:44.440]   device they managed to rack up four hundred dollars for their expenses uh by buying donuts or whatever
[01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:48.760]   it is that these kids do with their beep boops uh and that's that's a pain point and something that
[01:16:48.760 --> 01:16:55.800]   really should be sanded down ios will uh have beats music bundled into it according to the
[01:16:55.800 --> 01:17:01.800]   financial times um i would go to the financial times article but it's behind a pay wall so let's
[01:17:01.800 --> 01:17:07.800]   just give macrumers.com the credit here uh apple will bundle a subscription music service that
[01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:13.320]   acquired from beats into its ios operating system early next year says ft instantly making it available
[01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:18.600]   on hundreds of millions of iPhones and ipads and ramping up pressure on spotify um it will still
[01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:23.240]   stuff but they'll still be a paid for service it's not going to be free um the big question
[01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:27.560]   there is they say hundreds of millions of devices which means it has to go beyond the us yet beats
[01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:32.600]   is still us on the itunes uh radio is still us in australia only right i don't know whether they've
[01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:36.040]   been waiting to go international until they did the merger because you know they obviously knew
[01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:40.360]   about it or if they're they still are going to find it really difficult to go international but
[01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:45.320]   it either the way the article reports it doesn't seem to you know conform to reality as i understand
[01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:49.720]   the financial times is in england right yeah and there's neither yeah neither of those there are
[01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:56.200]   available yeah um will they rebrand it will say beats well i mean it could be as easy as just putting
[01:17:56.200 --> 01:18:02.360]   the app on the uh phones and the uh tablets right i mean that's all it means necessary or does it
[01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:09.880]   mean that they'll itunes radio be modified uh to have beats music in it why tunes radio is not separate
[01:18:09.880 --> 01:18:14.280]   there was rumors that it would go separate prior to the beats launch and it's still inside the music
[01:18:14.280 --> 01:18:18.520]   app so it would make sense i mean i can't say because i don't run app i'm not any queue but
[01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:22.440]   what would be interesting is if they spun it off into a separate app that combined both
[01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:26.520]   the subscription beat service and the itunes radio service and they were supposedly going to do
[01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:30.520]   that that was the rumor right yeah and the rumors also they're going to rebrand beats into something
[01:18:30.520 --> 01:18:37.480]   itunes and leave the beats brand for the really headphones yeah because it's not like the beats
[01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:42.440]   streaming music service has huge customer uptake it's still probably one of the smallest only because
[01:18:42.440 --> 01:18:47.720]   it's the one of the last yeah so there's no reason to preserve that brand what you want to preserve
[01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:52.840]   though is the really cool way that beats music lets you choose what you want to listen to you kind of
[01:18:52.840 --> 01:19:01.480]   construct a sentence you know i want to listen to edm music uh in a dance hall with shinny and then
[01:19:01.480 --> 01:19:06.440]   it will play the appropriate tunes the human curation part is what they were really interesting
[01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:12.200]   right oh is that is that a letterman swedder you're wearing like you double letter and both
[01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:17.960]   swimming and football and basketball are you mocking me no i'm just i'm just saying this my
[01:19:17.960 --> 01:19:24.120]   hair looks normal so but what is normal right on the planet shingy everybody's my hair would look
[01:19:24.120 --> 01:19:31.640]   flat in anime he is the normal one he's the normal one yeah uh it was last week
[01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:38.680]   right at the show time that the apple released the uh apple watch sdk in a movie and we were kind of
[01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:45.160]   trying to parse it in real time as we watched and read uh since then anything more any more
[01:19:45.160 --> 01:19:52.680]   insights into what apple watch means rene the overall impression go ahead and i'm sorry i
[01:19:52.680 --> 01:19:56.040]   think i know you've gone deeper dive than i have i spent i spent a day watching the videos and
[01:19:56.040 --> 01:20:01.560]   talking to people about it but i'd most try to figure out what i felt about it right basically
[01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:07.480]   basically it impressed me that how much how interesting the difference between having a
[01:20:08.200 --> 01:20:14.120]   watch that runs its own operating system and has a great level of autonomy and only chooses to
[01:20:14.120 --> 01:20:20.600]   show off its power by how intimate the connection is between the pocket device and the wrist device
[01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:26.120]   is different from apple watch which is we're putting all of our processing power into hosting
[01:20:26.120 --> 01:20:30.440]   the greatest user interface we can possibly put on a wrist and we're going to lean on the phone as
[01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:35.560]   much as possible for the things that we do with it um so i don't know how that's going to express
[01:20:35.560 --> 01:20:41.480]   itself in the term in the in the form of of actual apps um we basically uh in the past week we've
[01:20:41.480 --> 01:20:45.640]   only kind of underscored some of the things we we hit on last week which is that chiefly the watch
[01:20:45.640 --> 01:20:50.120]   is going to in the first in the first iteration of the software is going to be simply receiving
[01:20:50.120 --> 01:20:55.080]   notifications and returning actions uh to uh a phone app is going to be pretty much a dumb terminal
[01:20:55.080 --> 01:21:00.760]   it's going to be like a vt 100 only on your wrist uh and self self-hosted apps are going to come
[01:21:00.760 --> 01:21:06.600]   much later in the year uh more interesting is what apple was talking about what uh what uh the the
[01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:11.720]   role of a watch app is going to be my mind was said at ease when they were talking about how
[01:21:11.720 --> 01:21:19.720]   the glances not long lingering loving looks that's not a direct quote but that's pretty much what
[01:21:19.720 --> 01:21:24.440]   they're talking about where they have they used as one example uh an app that's uh the american
[01:21:24.440 --> 01:21:27.880]   airlines app where if someone just looks at it it will just simply say here's what your flight
[01:21:27.880 --> 01:21:32.680]   status is if you hold the watch in that position then it will go a little bit deeper but at no point
[01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:37.960]   are you is apple encouraging people to do things like change their seat assignment or check in for
[01:21:37.960 --> 01:21:42.520]   flight through the watch that this is the point in which we hand you off back to the phone for uh
[01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:46.760]   for deeper things so that did set my mind at ease because i was very very worried given the demo
[01:21:46.760 --> 01:21:51.800]   they gave in september that maybe they're expecting me to spend a lot of time futzing around with
[01:21:51.800 --> 01:21:56.360]   this little device that has so many controls on it so we're still guessing but there's
[01:21:57.160 --> 01:22:01.400]   more optimism i think for me than there was a couple months ago Renee what did you take away
[01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:06.520]   yeah it's really interesting because you know apple has said native apps are coming next year
[01:22:06.520 --> 01:22:09.640]   so coming next year you'll be able to do all the sorts of independent apps you'll be able to go
[01:22:09.640 --> 01:22:14.520]   jogging with your watch and not have to worry that you're leaving your apps essentially behind if
[01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:19.320]   you don't have your phones with you the way it is right now it's very similar to pre-i phone sdk
[01:22:19.320 --> 01:22:22.600]   where there were web apps and when you were disconnected from the internet the app essentially
[01:22:22.600 --> 01:22:28.040]   couldn't update right now it requires the phones when you're not connected to your phone your apps
[01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:31.640]   will not be able to update and that's going to dictate a lot of what developers can do with it
[01:22:31.640 --> 01:22:35.160]   but it's a short-term thing whether apple just doesn't have time now or they don't they don't
[01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:39.800]   have the right things in place that'll get solved next year for now it's really interesting because
[01:22:39.800 --> 01:22:44.280]   exactly what Andy said is that they've staged this by attention and if you look at the verbs that
[01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:49.720]   they use their short look and long look notifications and if your watch is down or pointed away from you
[01:22:49.720 --> 01:22:53.880]   privacy comes into play because it only gives you the short look it gives you an icon and not much
[01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:57.960]   else if you bring it close to you it gives you the long look but also in low power mode if it starts
[01:22:57.960 --> 01:23:02.840]   running low on battery it'll stop doing long look notifications and just just do the short look ones
[01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:08.120]   so it's staging them based on attention and based on power consumption then glances they're not
[01:23:08.120 --> 01:23:12.200]   calling them widgets they're giving them a very verb you know active sort of a name and that gives
[01:23:12.200 --> 01:23:16.920]   you a little bit more information even so you go from short look to long look to glance and then
[01:23:16.920 --> 01:23:21.960]   you have the watch kit apps which are essentially the interface runs on the phone and all the logic
[01:23:21.960 --> 01:23:26.520]   is sorry the interface runs on the watch and all the logic is behind on the phone and that's sort of
[01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:32.280]   a bet that Bluetooth connectivity is less power intensive and better for a watch kit style app
[01:23:32.280 --> 01:23:38.040]   than actually making the processor do it on the watch itself which kind of gives you a hint of
[01:23:38.040 --> 01:23:42.360]   where apples emphasis is for this they want to do everything they can to make sure the phone is
[01:23:42.360 --> 01:23:48.440]   as sorry the watch is as power efficient as possible and then you get into it and it's really interesting
[01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:54.040]   because as much as the as iOS and OS 10 have gone white apples asking developers to go black
[01:23:54.040 --> 01:23:59.000]   with the watch kit apps because the phone has a very large bezel and it's black and if you make
[01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:02.520]   the app black it's going to look white screen on you and if you make it bright it's going to look
[01:24:02.520 --> 01:24:06.840]   very small and they're also stressing what makes sense what makes sense for somebody glance at a
[01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:11.080]   lot of apps simply aren't going to make sense on on the watch it's going to be much easier to get
[01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:15.400]   your phone and do anything intensive but something that's just convenient based whether you want to
[01:24:15.400 --> 01:24:21.240]   check you want to glance at your logging you want to do a quick NFC payment so an apple pay payment
[01:24:21.240 --> 01:24:26.680]   you want to get an update on a status that's a very quick engagement a very quick interaction
[01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:31.080]   and you can do that on the watch so it looks like this is really really well thought out and like
[01:24:31.080 --> 01:24:35.480]   we said last week totally you know a lot based on extensibility a lot based on continuity which
[01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:39.880]   seems like a very virtuous cycle for them and easy to understand for developers so it's all going
[01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:44.760]   to come down to what sort of experiences they can get on that watch come come launch time yeah
[01:24:44.760 --> 01:24:49.960]   it's interesting to see how much control they give to developers and then to the users
[01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:55.000]   that is something that I wouldn't say that I worried about the but we're talking about going
[01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:59.960]   to low battery mode and then the watch making a decision not to do things that are battery intensive
[01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:05.480]   well sometimes you're like look I got this battery this watch just pardon me this watch just has to
[01:25:05.480 --> 01:25:09.640]   last me 10 minutes until I board the plane and until I board the plane I really need to know
[01:25:09.640 --> 01:25:13.720]   this information that I'm trying to get off of it don't try to help me by making it harder for me
[01:25:13.720 --> 01:25:17.800]   to find something I need for you to watch to do and it's it's such an interesting
[01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:23.800]   it's such an interesting concept because people have people are still completely malleable on what
[01:25:23.800 --> 01:25:27.720]   a watch should do and how it should behave and what their reaction should be so this launch is
[01:25:27.720 --> 01:25:32.920]   going to be so important they can get an apple can can get away with pretty much whatever they want
[01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:39.160]   except for not matching what at one of the one million expectations people have of this device
[01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:43.240]   so it's so there's there's so much room for so many different approaches to it and I think it's
[01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:48.360]   still going to be a couple of years until people figure out what what a watch what a smart watch
[01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:51.880]   should do in the same way that it took a while for them to figure out what a graphical user
[01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:57.400]   interface app should be or what a mobile app should be it's also I mean it's a big bet on the
[01:25:57.400 --> 01:26:02.120]   experience if you've used extensibility or you've used continuity a lot especially continuity with
[01:26:02.120 --> 01:26:07.080]   handoff sometimes it's absolutely instant and sometimes you can count to 10 or 15 or 20 before
[01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:11.480]   it happens and it's not a huge deal because you have the other devices but on the watch that's the
[01:26:11.480 --> 01:26:16.440]   entire sum total of experiences until native apps hit and if it's 20 seconds to get an update
[01:26:16.440 --> 01:26:20.840]   there might be a frustration level that doesn't exist on any other device yeah apple has to do
[01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:25.240]   the thing that they often do which is this has to work it has to work it has to work and if we
[01:26:25.240 --> 01:26:30.440]   cannot it does not work 100% of the time we should not ship this or we should not include this feature
[01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:35.240]   here I mean I like what I like so many things about my android bear watch but one of them is that
[01:26:35.240 --> 01:26:40.120]   it does pretty much the same thing where it will give you answers and short interactions but at
[01:26:40.120 --> 01:26:45.080]   some point it will hand you back off to the phone and it always I've never had a problem where
[01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:48.920]   I'll get that big button saying open on phone I tap the button and by the time I take my phone
[01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:52.680]   out of my pocket the screen is lit up and it's showing me the information that I actually want
[01:26:52.680 --> 01:26:58.040]   which is why I actually use it as opposed to like don't bother with it because if there's a there's
[01:26:58.040 --> 01:27:01.880]   a one out of 10 chance it's not going to do anything it's just not I will never get in the habit of
[01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:07.320]   relying on it so if apple just makes the first iteration so good that people come to trust and
[01:27:07.320 --> 01:27:13.880]   rely on it no matter what how limited the feature set is that's going to be the big win we're to take
[01:27:13.880 --> 01:27:21.000]   a break when we come back gentlemen prepare your picks but first it's time to shave everybody together
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:26.760]   oh you're not shaving for November this is our last Mac break weekly for the month of mauvember
[01:27:26.760 --> 01:27:33.640]   that's the month that many men around the world stop shaving for a raise awareness for men's
[01:27:33.640 --> 01:27:40.120]   health issues but if you are getting prepared to shave it all come December 1st if you're special
[01:27:40.120 --> 01:27:45.960]   other person in your life says shave that beard or mustache then I got to tell you about harries
[01:27:45.960 --> 01:27:51.080]   and take a look at these beautiful kits from harries this would be a great gift for the holidays
[01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:58.040]   harries was started by guys who think razor blades are razors are too expensive
[01:27:58.040 --> 01:28:04.440]   they figured there's a better way to do this in fact they wanted to make sure that you got the best
[01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:12.040]   quality razors and blades so they actually bought a factory in Germany they bought the factory this
[01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:19.880]   is commitment to create really good blades historically almost all the world's razor blade
[01:28:19.880 --> 01:28:24.440]   factories have been controlled by the big name brands that's how come they could charge you like
[01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:30.040]   four dollars a blade uh yeah that's the model isn't it we've even said that you know you give away
[01:28:30.040 --> 01:28:35.240]   the razor and you make it up on the blade well harries wants to change things they are now the
[01:28:35.240 --> 01:28:41.080]   only brand in the world that makes blades and sells direct and that's how they can get the price down
[01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:47.960]   to so much less about half as much as you might spend for say a Gillette fusion blade all because
[01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:53.640]   of this wonderful factory which has been making some of the world's best blades since 1920
[01:28:53.640 --> 01:29:01.160]   400 German engineers designers craftsmen and workers build and create very sophisticated equipment

[01:32:13.560 --> 01:32:22.200]   it's going play and never see you anywhere come at the door so you could turn her on or off if they
[01:32:22.200 --> 01:32:26.760]   just added auto tune i'd be so into this oh why don't they have auto tune you can record yourself
[01:32:26.760 --> 01:32:34.920]   as you sing along so do you want to build a snowman with leo when i come to twit i expect to not hear
[01:32:34.920 --> 01:32:41.400]   frozen music because i hear it all the time at home i bet lucy loves frozen i can't even tell you
[01:32:41.400 --> 01:32:46.200]   thousands of times we've heard that if she's gonna love something frozen's a good thing for her love
[01:32:46.200 --> 01:32:51.960]   rights yes i think so it's a wonderful movie i agree and uh they so they have nine songs
[01:32:51.960 --> 01:32:58.840]   from the movie you could choose your song sing along record your small child singing
[01:32:58.840 --> 01:33:06.040]   it's so much fun and notice next to the floppy disk icon which small children probably won't
[01:33:06.040 --> 01:33:11.480]   recognize there is a trash can icon which parents will know means throw this thing out
[01:33:13.080 --> 01:33:15.080]   you're wow you're filming
[01:33:15.080 --> 01:33:26.280]   am i giving you chills Jason i'm just realizing how much i know all the words this entire soundtrack
[01:33:26.280 --> 01:33:30.600]   i don't need those words at the bottom of the screen can i turn those off because i don't get
[01:33:30.600 --> 01:33:35.080]   done that's a good question i don't i don't know i could turn off the singing but i don't know if
[01:33:35.080 --> 01:33:38.360]   i could draft the words can we can we get a couple verses from Jason just no
[01:33:41.160 --> 01:33:44.520]   don't got a few flaws like it's through your brain dear
[01:33:44.520 --> 01:33:50.840]   all right
[01:33:50.840 --> 01:34:00.280]   thanks 799 on the app store now we take it to mr rene richie for his much more appropriate pick of
[01:34:00.280 --> 01:34:06.040]   the week i've got to uh the first one is is well known it's probably been picked before but it's
[01:34:06.040 --> 01:34:10.600]   recently been updated it's deliveries by june cloud and it's a great app that lets you track
[01:34:10.600 --> 01:34:13.800]   when you're doing all your holiday shopping if you're shopping online and you're going to have
[01:34:13.800 --> 01:34:17.640]   stuff delivered to you and you want to make sure you know what day it's arriving that you're home to
[01:34:17.640 --> 01:34:22.680]   get it deliveries you speak all deliveries touch for iOS has always been my go-to app and now it's
[01:34:22.680 --> 01:34:27.640]   been updated for iOS 8 and it includes uh today view widgets so you don't have to actually launch
[01:34:27.640 --> 01:34:32.040]   the app anymore you can just pull down the notification center make sure that you're actually on the
[01:34:32.040 --> 01:34:36.920]   today's screen and the widget will be right there and it'll tell you when all your packages are
[01:34:36.920 --> 01:34:41.720]   arriving i've been using it all week to track you know various stuff that i've bought and
[01:34:41.720 --> 01:34:46.600]   it's funny because widgets it they're not surfaced enough that a lot of people know about them but
[01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:52.120]   once you know about them everything from pcalc to i'll use it for drop box it's so quick to get
[01:34:52.120 --> 01:34:55.720]   access to this information from anywhere i don't even have to go back to the home screen anymore i
[01:34:55.720 --> 01:35:00.360]   just pull down the shade no matter where i am and it tells me right there and i don't suffer that
[01:35:00.360 --> 01:35:04.120]   problem anymore of you hit the home screen button you get there and then you forget why it was you
[01:35:04.120 --> 01:35:08.520]   hit the home screen button i end up opening twitter again i thought it was just my age okay good that's
[01:35:08.520 --> 01:35:12.120]   good enough no it's apparently it's a psychological thing it's like when you go through doorways
[01:35:12.120 --> 01:35:17.960]   anytime you change state it's hard to remember what transpired between the two states so it's
[01:35:17.960 --> 01:35:22.520]   that's my excuse anyway Leo because i'm old too i'm changing states so you know what this is a good
[01:35:22.520 --> 01:35:27.800]   tip as long as we're showing you drop pull down your notification shade scroll down to the bottom
[01:35:27.800 --> 01:35:31.720]   you see i have a lot of notifications and there's an edit button once you hit the edit button you
[01:35:31.720 --> 01:35:36.600]   can see which ones are turned on oddly enough they have the red icon that's because if you hit it
[01:35:36.600 --> 01:35:41.320]   it may turn it off but then there's a list and as you install apps this list gets longer of all
[01:35:41.320 --> 01:35:45.880]   the apps you've already got installed that have notifications so you can add those notifications
[01:35:45.880 --> 01:35:51.640]   just by tapping that uh and the green button and adding it to your notifications list so if you
[01:35:51.640 --> 01:35:56.200]   don't know what what what special widgets are available there there's the list right there in the
[01:35:56.200 --> 01:36:02.920]   no it really helped me out because i ordered a 13 inch MacBook Pro i love yeah and i it was
[01:36:02.920 --> 01:36:06.280]   supposed to come on wednesday so i made sure i was on wednesday but then i saw in delivery status
[01:36:06.280 --> 01:36:10.360]   that it was coming on monday and i quickly changed my plans and it did arrive on monday so i would
[01:36:10.360 --> 01:36:14.440]   have i would have totally missed the delivery if i hadn't been keeping track of it do you have how
[01:36:14.440 --> 01:36:19.240]   does it work do you have to have it scan your email i just enter i just enter in the tracking
[01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:24.120]   number there might be smarter ways of doing it but i've been using it since i think ios too so i
[01:36:24.120 --> 01:36:29.400]   stuck with what i know yeah i have a program on andry called slice that scans your gmail and then
[01:36:29.400 --> 01:36:34.760]   so it auto adds everything uh as long as you get an email notification about shipments yeah i don't
[01:36:34.760 --> 01:36:39.480]   give you i i'm just i know yeah well that's why i ask because some people don't want to do that yeah
[01:36:39.480 --> 01:36:44.200]   yeah so this way you just put the tracking number in and you'll know yeah awesome uh the the other
[01:36:44.200 --> 01:36:48.920]   pick i had and it's just a quick one it's uh uh due disclosure it's it's a a guy that i co-host a
[01:36:48.920 --> 01:36:53.960]   podcast with who made the app but it's called stringer and what it does is it shuffles if you're
[01:36:53.960 --> 01:36:57.480]   used to just shuffling music and you want to shuffle to the next song it's one thing but if you're
[01:36:57.480 --> 01:37:01.240]   shuffling and you decide you really like the song and you want to hear the next one on the album or
[01:37:01.240 --> 01:37:06.280]   you want to do anything that involves customizing between the shuffles uh stringer is great i don't
[01:37:06.280 --> 01:37:10.760]   listen to a lot of music i watch you know much more tv than do music but i found this really useful
[01:37:10.760 --> 01:37:14.920]   because when i do listen to something it hits some sort of sense memory in me and then you know i'm
[01:37:15.720 --> 01:37:19.400]   i'm hearing an abba song all of a sudden i you know i really want to hear the next one on this list
[01:37:19.400 --> 01:37:23.560]   right and you go right into it and it's very visual it's a really nice looking app it's super easy to
[01:37:23.560 --> 01:37:28.520]   navigate and it's a great way if you are a fan of shuffled music but you just always wish you had
[01:37:28.520 --> 01:37:32.360]   more control over it than a pure random shuffle stringer gives you a lot of great control so this
[01:37:32.360 --> 01:37:39.160]   replaces the shuffles uh feature in iTunes with its own shuffle through your iTunes list you know one
[01:37:39.160 --> 01:37:44.040]   thing i always wish i could see is the previous the previous songs can you go back can you go up and
[01:37:44.040 --> 01:37:48.840]   down in that list and see what you listen to i never try but the way it looks to me like you
[01:37:48.840 --> 01:37:55.400]   could test that yeah and i actually like the ui nicely done yeah it's the it's their first app and
[01:37:55.400 --> 01:38:06.360]   uh it turned out i think really nicely stringer and it is from hayderby.com h-e-y-r-b-y dot it's the
[01:38:06.360 --> 01:38:09.720]   product branch of nickelfish and nickelfish you've never heard of them they've done a lot of the
[01:38:09.720 --> 01:38:14.440]   very popular like if you've used a corporate app you know for a hotel or a car company or something
[01:38:14.440 --> 01:38:18.120]   you might have used their work for. Oh should we talk to them about doing a twitter?
[01:38:18.120 --> 01:38:23.880]   They're good i mean it they're expensive as well but we should talk to them.
[01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:31.080]   We wanted to do kind of uh reference apps uh for twitch. They did the first version of the iMore app.
[01:38:31.080 --> 01:38:36.920]   Oh well there you go i will talk to them i'll i'll email you offline and finally Andy Inako's
[01:38:36.920 --> 01:38:43.000]   pick of the week Andy. Mine's an oldie but goodie and also a very situationally one.
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:50.760]   It's things for uh things for iOS uh by cultured code. There are to-do list managers and then there
[01:38:50.760 --> 01:38:58.120]   are to-do project goals aspirations managers and the king of that category is uh certainly
[01:38:58.120 --> 01:39:05.320]   uh on-ne focus uh but the thing is these are kind of complicated apps where it doesn't really if you
[01:39:05.320 --> 01:39:09.640]   if your habit is just to go into Evernote and just make to-do list and check things off
[01:39:09.640 --> 01:39:14.440]   that doesn't translate directly to one of these big big apps uh things is a little bit simpler
[01:39:14.440 --> 01:39:18.760]   than omni-focus uh that's what one of the differentiators that i've always had between the two and
[01:39:18.760 --> 01:39:24.520]   also this week until uh the 28th until uh until the end of the week it is free for iOS.
[01:39:24.520 --> 01:39:29.480]   Wow. Normally 10 bucks we can get the iPhone version and the iPad version for free. The Mac
[01:39:29.480 --> 01:39:34.360]   version is 30% off also for the same amount of time again it ends on November 28th.
[01:39:34.360 --> 01:39:40.040]   It's their uh it's the Apple Store uh Piculaweek uh and so it's a really good opportunity if you
[01:39:40.040 --> 01:39:44.440]   think that you've have uh that your life and your work and your personal life could be improved
[01:39:44.440 --> 01:39:50.360]   by switching from again Evernote simple to-do lists to a real task and goal manager.
[01:39:50.360 --> 01:39:54.520]   This is a cheap way to get into that and see if you can adapt your way of thinking to
[01:39:54.520 --> 01:39:59.720]   or sort of the highly structured way of project management of these apps to help you to do.
[01:39:59.720 --> 01:40:03.160]   Normally 10 bucks probably worth 20 bucks and it's free for the next week.
[01:40:03.160 --> 01:40:07.240]   That's a good deal yeah 10 bucks that that was the one thing that always kept me from trying it is
[01:40:07.240 --> 01:40:12.120]   oh it's 10 bucks yeah um so that's a good thing that's good. It shows up I mean it's I hope this
[01:40:12.120 --> 01:40:17.080]   is a good opportunity for cultured code because I love that on other platforms you can simply get
[01:40:17.080 --> 01:40:21.880]   a they can they can release a trial version right and so you can really on an app like this 10
[01:40:21.880 --> 01:40:25.960]   bucks is not a lot of money for such a such a such a polished piece of software but it's probably
[01:40:25.960 --> 01:40:31.080]   above the oh what the hell I'll give it a try threshold for most people so this is a again not
[01:40:31.080 --> 01:40:34.840]   not just a good opportunity if you're thinking about things but also if you're thinking about
[01:40:34.840 --> 01:40:39.080]   making that step up from a checklist of to-dos to something that's a little bit more organized a
[01:40:39.080 --> 01:40:44.040]   little bit more structured I have to admit that I personally have never gotten my head around this
[01:40:44.040 --> 01:40:49.160]   highly structured project management idea because what it tries to make you do is try to think in
[01:40:49.160 --> 01:40:52.680]   terms of what are the broader goals and what are the where are the places and the opportunities you
[01:40:52.680 --> 01:40:58.040]   have to get items off of that off of your to-do lists and off of a toward making your progress
[01:40:58.040 --> 01:41:03.160]   towards those goals and I find that I find so much time trying to think about how this app wants me
[01:41:03.160 --> 01:41:09.320]   to contextualize the process of building and designing and building a new standing desk to
[01:41:09.320 --> 01:41:14.280]   just well what if I just simply have to do list number one design it to number two by the lumber
[01:41:14.280 --> 01:41:21.000]   three cut it and build it but so it's a really good opportunity for you to start to mess around
[01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:25.880]   with this or something lovely to to-dos are the gym memberships of apps to-dos are the gym
[01:41:25.880 --> 01:41:29.800]   member well that's to always I always get more and more of them and then I know sometimes during
[01:41:29.800 --> 01:41:34.680]   the year I stop going but things are just an amazing one hey by the way we talked about this
[01:41:34.680 --> 01:41:40.200]   actually on the iPad a day yesterday but it should it's worth a mention that Carousel for dropbox is
[01:41:40.200 --> 01:41:44.680]   now an app available for us and that's a good one to mention to if you've been storing your photos
[01:41:44.680 --> 01:41:50.920]   on dropbox this will give you a gallery of your photos on Dropbox and Ben on Twitter says that
[01:41:50.920 --> 01:41:55.400]   you can forward email to June Cloud and they will automatically add it on to deliveries for you
[01:41:55.400 --> 01:42:01.240]   ah that's the easy way to do it yeah that's the way to do it so if you've got June Cloud to
[01:42:01.240 --> 01:42:05.800]   keep track of your package deliveries just forward that first mail from them yeah track at June Cloud
[01:42:05.800 --> 01:42:09.960]   dot com and it automatically adds it's like trip it that way I love that yeah all right you know the
[01:42:09.960 --> 01:42:14.200]   more sophisticated solution would be not only that but also to figure out that you have an eye if
[01:42:14.200 --> 01:42:19.080]   once you once it realizes that okay you have an iPhone delivery for Friday to arrange for well
[01:42:19.080 --> 01:42:23.560]   here are delivery restaurants that will deliver pizzas and food to your house so that you don't
[01:42:23.560 --> 01:42:28.200]   have to you know leave the house and then you for even five minutes check on my valuation Andy
[01:42:28.200 --> 01:42:33.400]   shall we schedule the post office to pick up the mail that you were gonna go out there
[01:42:33.400 --> 01:42:39.880]   it's uber for pizza uber for pizza no no no wait a minute that's a bad word yeah don't say uber
[01:42:39.880 --> 01:42:48.040]   for anything like he's like that little little bit of stage act no no no no no no thank you ladies
[01:42:48.040 --> 01:42:53.160]   gentlemen for joining us for this edition of Mac break weekly there was no news this week so
[01:42:53.160 --> 01:42:58.920]   we made it a short show we've had we're thankful for the lack of news yeah it gives us a chance
[01:42:58.920 --> 01:43:05.560]   to talk more Andy and I go to Chicago Sun times good to have you as always it's been a slice I

[01:43:10.040 --> 01:43:17.400]   are you going somewhere you're doing anything I will be spending Thanksgiving with my family nice very
[01:43:17.400 --> 01:43:23.880]   nice I have I have been asked to bring a covered dish and so I'm gonna have to go to the stop and
[01:43:23.880 --> 01:43:28.360]   shop throw some elbows to make sure I get those tiny marshmallows and that little canada dried
[01:43:28.360 --> 01:43:34.120]   onions that's it I'll I'll see that lady in hell before I let that other neighbor of mine get the
[01:43:34.120 --> 01:43:42.040]   last can of dried dried dried onions do your people do cranberries I think cranberries are grown
[01:43:42.040 --> 01:43:48.280]   out your way are they not yes and but the the cranberry divide is just a sharp in Massachusetts
[01:43:48.280 --> 01:43:54.040]   and New England as it is anywhere else and the and usual I've rarely been to a Thanksgiving with
[01:43:54.040 --> 01:43:59.800]   more than with with above let's say nine people which there was not the the cam cranberries
[01:43:59.800 --> 01:44:08.200]   it's the jelly and the in the fruit kind yeah do you want the jelly the the ocean spray jelly in
[01:44:08.200 --> 01:44:13.480]   the can that when you put it in the dish still has the ribs from the can as long as it's produced
[01:44:13.480 --> 01:44:21.400]   by local growers okay or do you want the one with five communities the people who spend all that time
[01:44:21.400 --> 01:44:26.200]   waiting around in them bogs it's a ball off people don't know that food on their children
[01:44:26.200 --> 01:44:31.880]   leo cranberries growing bogs they're in swamps and they have to go out and boats and get them
[01:44:31.880 --> 01:44:36.040]   I was I'm actually I'm actually kind of depressed there's this there was a cranberry
[01:44:36.040 --> 01:44:40.360]   bog that used to drive past like at least three times a week it's in the
[01:44:40.360 --> 01:44:47.320]   Walpole or it's either Walpole or nor were the those of you who are who know suburban Boston
[01:44:47.320 --> 01:44:51.960]   and it's like and now even when the cranberry bog is dry it's like oh there's that's where
[01:44:51.960 --> 01:44:55.960]   that's where they grow cranberries and now there's big signs of turning into the land into a condo
[01:44:55.960 --> 01:45:00.760]   developer and I'm like that's that's not more interesting than cranberries nothing's more
[01:45:00.760 --> 01:45:04.360]   interesting than a cranberry ball you look forward to driving past and see oh look they flooded the
[01:45:04.360 --> 01:45:09.800]   bogs there they're about ready to harvest you're regret that and then there's that those magical
[01:45:09.800 --> 01:45:13.720]   times you're actually there when you see the big boom that's swinging around like oh man
[01:45:13.720 --> 01:45:19.640]   I never cultural hell of heritage is New Englanders I've never I know I grew up with the cranberry
[01:45:19.640 --> 01:45:24.840]   bogs but I don't think I have a saw I'm harvested so I missed that and now and now and now if you're
[01:45:24.840 --> 01:45:30.680]   in Walpole Leo you never will apparently sad the collapse of the Walpole Cranberry what a shame

[01:48:33.960 --> 01:48:39.320]   hardly boasting of the fact that i'm very slow on the uptake in general yeah i think that's part of
[01:48:39.320 --> 01:48:49.560]   the problem yeah teespring how often do i advertise them every damn show t double e spring dot com
[01:48:49.560 --> 01:48:54.520]   slash twit teespring is great that just raised they just raised a huge amount of money i think
[01:48:54.520 --> 01:49:00.440]   uh of adventure funding uh started by a couple of college guys and uh we've been really uh it's
[01:49:00.440 --> 01:49:05.320]   been fun partnering with them so they do some nice stuff for us uh in this case maybe not so great
[01:49:06.360 --> 01:49:11.880]   teespring dot com slash twit you know what you should own it now so that you can say i bought it
[01:49:11.880 --> 01:49:14.440]   the big collectors i don't think it's gonna be a cool classic yeah it's a very few of them
[01:49:14.440 --> 01:49:19.480]   we don't make extras if we don't it's gonna be the one that no one has because no one ordered it
[01:49:19.480 --> 01:49:23.960]   at the time it's it's we we're not supposed to say this but we're short packing these these
[01:49:23.960 --> 01:49:28.520]   these shirts i don't know what that means some that believe me though they know what it means they

[01:49:42.120 --> 01:49:46.200]   the lessons of not buying something immediately as soon as it comes out and then holding on to it
[01:49:46.200 --> 01:49:54.120]   these are care about your investment future mint in the box collector grade shirts actually you know

[01:51:37.240 --> 01:51:42.120]   great yes that's bizarre i don't understand did you do the port forwarding this time no
[01:51:42.120 --> 01:51:52.200]   i think uh something happened i don't know here's a video on how cranberries are grown
[01:51:53.080 --> 01:52:01.560]   ha ha ha while we watch the video the ocean spray is a consortium consortium of cranberry
[01:52:01.560 --> 01:52:09.720]   growers and distributors here she is miss ocean spray 2012 how many are native to this land cranberries
[01:52:09.720 --> 01:52:18.040]   are one of them there they are in the bog you can make them into syrups you can make them into parts
[01:52:18.040 --> 01:52:22.120]   it's like the best punch bowl ever have you ever heard of this thing called a craze
[01:52:22.120 --> 01:52:30.440]   well is are they harvesting the cranberries from the bog right now is that what that is
[01:52:30.440 --> 01:52:37.880]   absolutely see it's it's a dry growth uh field and what they found out was that you could very
[01:52:37.880 --> 01:52:42.440]   easily if you flood you flood the bog there's like usually levels of cranberry bog so you start
[01:52:42.440 --> 01:52:46.760]   off with a with a with the highest elevation bog they flood that and then they have these beaten
[01:52:46.760 --> 01:52:50.920]   machines that because the cranberries are lighter than the water less dense they float to the top
[01:52:50.920 --> 01:52:56.120]   then you can just simply get a boom and skim them off see ah and then you take you take the water
[01:52:56.120 --> 01:53:01.480]   from the highest bog used to flood so you're saying you're saying that these berries actually grow
[01:53:01.480 --> 01:53:07.320]   on the ground they don't grow in water you know it's just a harvesting technique right the bog is
[01:53:07.320 --> 01:53:13.560]   for a harvest exactly all because you know i mean we don't we don't they're small family on
[01:53:13.560 --> 01:53:17.800]   operations they don't they can't hire in like their pickers they don't have Mexicans in
[01:53:17.800 --> 01:53:24.360]   massachusetts that's the problem oh no only not going there i'm not you're on this journey
[01:53:24.360 --> 01:53:29.480]   you're on this journey over here in california we don't have this problem we just make people bend
[01:53:29.480 --> 01:53:35.560]   over stupelabre instead of floating actually actually it's a shortage of hipwaders it's like
[01:53:35.560 --> 01:53:41.320]   an important oh yeah you guys have a lot of hipwaders that are imposed upon us yeah we could not allow
[01:53:41.320 --> 01:53:46.040]   we have more hipwaders as many hipwaders as we need so fishing industry gets most of them if we
[01:53:46.040 --> 01:53:51.160]   don't pass immigration against them this is how all vegetables would be harvested in future it's a
[01:53:51.160 --> 01:53:58.200]   fruit it's a fruit it's a battery like it i never knew this i always thought they grew in bogs
[01:53:58.200 --> 01:54:03.320]   they take 16 months well it's a very bad business
[01:54:03.320 --> 01:54:09.240]   and plus no one wants them they've served once a year
[01:54:10.440 --> 01:54:15.480]   actually i did i did hear that i did hear that like the cranberry industry is lobbying against
[01:54:15.480 --> 01:54:20.040]   like the like beverage taxes because they're saying that look i mean it's not we're not just
[01:54:20.040 --> 01:54:24.040]   adding sugar to our cranberry juice because we're trying to make fat kids it's because these are
[01:54:24.040 --> 01:54:30.520]   very very bitter it's hot it's hot you don't want to drink a cranberry without some sugar in it
[01:54:30.520 --> 01:54:36.200]   exactly but i do love ocean spray cranberry juice it needs a sweetener sweetener but a little
[01:54:36.200 --> 01:54:42.840]   sweetener in there it's also good for bladder infections well i i i've never tried drinking it
[01:54:42.840 --> 01:54:46.920]   from that end but i'll take your word for it we don't start a cranberry podcast right now
[01:54:46.920 --> 01:54:52.680]   if you were to serve onion juice for a Thanksgiving you would also need sugar
[01:54:52.680 --> 01:55:01.480]   but we don't have the first idea was clam cran berryado oh remember remember that
[01:55:02.200 --> 01:55:06.840]   clamato well that's huge yearly that's how you make a place you know oh it's disgusting
[01:55:06.840 --> 01:55:13.160]   they put clams in your tomato juice yeah french french steward was the uh was a
[01:55:13.160 --> 01:55:18.040]   spokesperson from it because i can say well we're gonna have to get the weirdest person on tv to
[01:55:18.040 --> 01:55:24.280]   advertise that's a good idea i want oysters in my cranberry juice it is hugier i don't understand
[01:55:24.280 --> 01:55:29.560]   it but it's huge in Canada wow yeah oh we actually yeah but i love kamok we got moxie people drink
[01:55:29.560 --> 01:55:35.320]   moxie as a soda yeah we call it a rusted lug loosen
[01:55:35.320 --> 01:55:40.760]   pretty much people only eat cranberries once a year right cranberry juice
[01:55:40.760 --> 01:55:42.920]   how Christmas and Thanksgiving usually have that yeah
[01:55:42.920 --> 01:55:49.880]   so the whole thing about floating them was just to make it easier to harvest them
[01:55:49.880 --> 01:55:54.040]   exactly again they have they have those things that basically beat the bushes to like separate
[01:55:54.040 --> 01:55:58.600]   them from the bush and they float to the towns right why can't you should do that with brussel
[01:55:58.600 --> 01:56:05.080]   sprouts and other vegetables maybe they're not as old nor the durability that cranberry does
[01:56:05.080 --> 01:56:08.920]   i feel like i should hand in my road island sent uh set is in ship god
[01:56:08.920 --> 01:56:13.320]   because i never knew that i always thought they grew in bogs
[01:56:13.320 --> 01:56:20.680]   they're a bog fruit bog fruit all right guys i will i will let you go after this okay
[01:56:20.680 --> 01:56:24.280]   thank you have thanksgiving have a happy thanksgiving everybody thank you thank you
