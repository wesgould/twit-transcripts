[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.200]   Then not only that, but also him and James Randy.
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.200]   Oh come on.
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.200]   He's a great writer.
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.200]   The amazing Randy?
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.200]   The amazing, quite amazing, Randy.
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.200]   And Mike Farrell from Mac, who's now, you know,
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.200]   without Mike Farrell from, like, Mr. Environmentalist.
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.200]   But I will consider him as BJ for Mac.
[00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.200]   Well, they're throwing Ned Begglian just for the bar guy.
[00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.200]   [ Laughter ]
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.200]   Hey, look, is that Erlichman from say it elsewhere?
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.200]   Yeah, yeah, I'm working here.
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.200]   Let's go.
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.200]   [ Sound Effects ]
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.200]   2008's That Guy conference.
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.200]   Hey, look, it's that guy.
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.200]   Yeah, I should say in just a little bit,
[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.200]   oh, let me introduce everybody.
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.200]   We would just kind of gas it around.
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.200]   Andy Enoco from the Chicago Sun Times and the
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.200]   Celestial Waste of bandwidth.
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.200]   Cwab.com.
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.200]   Oh, man.
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.200]   Yeah, that's right now.
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.200]   Scott Born is here.
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.200]   He's back.
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.200]   Hello, Scotty.
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.200]   And who?
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.200]   From the ApplephoneShow.com.
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.200]   And Padango.
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.200]   Merlin Mann, 43Folders.com.
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.200]   And I'm going to, I'm going to have to, in a little bit,
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.200]   we're going to get a rebuttal, by the way,
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.200]   on the Mac Heist conversation of last week.
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.200]   We talked to Rich Segal of bare bone software who kind of
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.200]   deprecated Mac Heist saying, you know, it's bad for software,
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.200]   bad for business.
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.200]   And these guys are kind of skanky.
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.200]   So we're going to get the head skank on.
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.200]   Phillip, I just, I'm just joking.
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.200]   That's probably not a good way to start this interview.
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.200]   [ Sound Effects ]
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.200]   Mays, do you ever dated Leo?
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.200]   [ Laughter ]
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.200]   Phillip Ryu will join us also.
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.200]   So a developer in the Mac community who has equal stature
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.200]   to Mr. Segal, Andrew Welch of Ambrosia.
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.200]   So they're going to rebut.
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.200]   They're going to say why Mac Heist is a good thing for all.
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.200]   Can I just ask the simplest of questions as a business person?
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.200]   Yeah.
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.200]   If, assuming that the folks at Mac Heist got the proper licensing,
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.200]   and of course they'd be crazy if they didn't,
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.200]   it's meaning that they got permission to distribute the software.
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.200]   Who's businesses?
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.200]   And if people decide they want their product as part of the deal,
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.200]   you know, clearly they've evaluated the situation and made a decision.
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.200]   It's free enterprise.
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.200]   It's America.
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.200]   If you want to put your deal in there, you put your deal in there.
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.200]   And if people buy it, they buy it.
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.200]   If they don't, they don't.
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.200]   [ Laughter ]
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.200]   Well, look, I think in these day and age, you should be careful
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.200]   about where you put your deal these days.
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.200]   [ Laughter ]
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.200]   Definitely get the references and some tests, maybe.
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.200]   But just to qualify things, I don't think Rich was saying
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.200]   that this is bad for America.
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.200]   I think he was just giving his personal opinions,
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.200]   which are certainly valid.
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.200]   I mean, my opinion has always been that, so kind of like what you're saying,
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.200]   Scott, the so long as the developers know what they're getting into
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.200]   and so long as they're being benefited the way that their contract says
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.200]   they should be benefited.
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.200]   I think that this is a great deal for consumers.
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.200]   But Rich definitely wasn't saying, "Hey, everybody, don't buy Mac Heist."
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.200]   I think he was just saying, in my opinion, as a developer,
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.200]   here are the reasons why I don't like it personally.
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.200]   Oh, all right.
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.200]   All right.
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.200]   In that case, there's no problem.
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.200]   Yeah.
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.200]   Okay.
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.200]   Good show, everybody.
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.200]   Okay.
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.200]   Thanks a lot.
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.200]   I'll see you later.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.200]   Back to the picks.
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.200]   Oh, I have an audible recommendation.
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.200]   Well, here's the thing.
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.200]   It's like beyond the money part of it.
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.200]   I mean, I know these guys are all taking less money,
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.200]   but look at the exposure they're getting.
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.200]   I mean, you know, you get a chance to build a relationship.
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.200]   Cost of customer acquisition these days is through the roof.
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.200]   And the cost of retaining customers is a lot lower.
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.200]   So if you even end up giving them the first version free and you do a good job at your
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.200]   work and they decide, "Well, I'll pay for updates."
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:23.200]   Your net net, as Merlin likes to say, would be improved.
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.200]   Well, we're going to table this until we get to Philip and Andrew on.
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.200]   Okay.
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.200]   And that'll be in just a second.
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.200]   But first, we have to talk to a hero.
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.200]   Let me see if I can add him to the conference real quickly.
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.200]   Johnny Johnny from Tiki Bar TV saved a life yesterday.
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.200]   And we've got to thank him.
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:45.200]   There's not many of us geeks who get to save an actual human life.
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.200]   Let me see if I can get him on the...
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.200]   Outsaving lives right now.
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.200]   He's on a rooftop coaxing a small child down.
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.200]   It's amazing, isn't it?
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.200]   There he is.
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.200]   Ladies and gentlemen, Johnny Johnny, aka Kevin Gamble,
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.200]   hero to geeks everywhere.
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.200]   But now he's not talking.
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.200]   He may be a hero, but he can't get Skype to work.
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.200]   Can you hear me, Johnny?
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.200]   He's a shot hero.
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.200]   He's doing the today show.
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.200]   He's making the rounds of the morning.
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.200]   Johnny, speak to me.
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.200]   Ohhh.
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:17.200]   So what happened is he just moved to a New York from Vancouver.
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.200]   Bloomberg's sighting in New York.
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.200]   He's standing on the subway platform.
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:25.200]   A woman in her 50s piers down the track to see how far away the oncoming train is
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:31.200]   and fell in clonking her head on the rail and passing out.
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.200]   Johnny Johnny looks down the track.
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.200]   He's a train coming.
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.200]   Says, well, there's only one thing to do.
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.200]   Leaps over the edge.
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.200]   I hope avoiding the third rail.
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:45.200]   Graspes the woman, throws her over his shoulder,
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.200]   hauls her up onto the platform.
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:51.200]   And the train goes...
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:52.200]   Shh.
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:57.200]   But he can't get Skype to work, so we'll just phrase him remotely.
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.200]   Thank you, Skype.
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.200]   That was much better than hearing this directly.
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.200]   We got that done a lot more efficiency.
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:06.200]   It was faster.
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.200]   Thanks to Skype.
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.200]   We saved a 10 minute rattle, thanks to Skype.
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.200]   Something about $10 worth of their coverage.
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.200]   All right, let's do some actual Mac news.
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:18.200]   And it was, of course, Apple, in its long standing tradition,
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:23.200]   delays any important Mac news till right after we finish recording on Tuesday.
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.200]   They did it again last week.
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.200]   They put out their earnings report.
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:33.200]   And they announced the best quarter in Apple history,
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.200]   the stock market's response, tank the stock.
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.200]   So let's go over the numbers.
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.200]   And then we'll talk to...
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:44.200]   Leo, are you supposed to have the June Taylor dancers come out at this point
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.200]   and Reed Scott's disclaimer?
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:46.200]   Yeah, wait a minute.
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.200]   No, that's not necessary anymore.
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.200]   It's not.
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:53.200]   You sold all your Apple stock when it was at about $199 and $59.
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.200]   You're kidding.
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.200]   No, my God.
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.200]   He sold at $200?
[00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:57.200]   Yeah.
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.200]   Scott, born you're a genius.
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.200]   That's kind of like everybody says about my stock picks.
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:03.200]   Yeah.
[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:04.200]   Actually, I wish I could say I was a genius.
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:07.200]   It just turned out I was involved in some other transactions that made it
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.200]   necessary for me to dump my Apple stock.
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:10.200]   You dumped a...
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:11.200]   Selling meth?
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:12.200]   Yeah, he's selling meth.
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:13.200]   He's into the crystal.
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.200]   You sold every share?
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.200]   Every single one.
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:21.200]   You can finally buy that solid gold house in that rocket car you've been winning.
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.200]   Yeah.
[00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.200]   Actually, I could say, as part of another trade,
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:27.200]   I had to dump my Apple stock.
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:31.200]   Otherwise, I'd have been writing it down to about $139 with everybody else.
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.200]   What was the peak?
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:35.200]   $212 or something like that.
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:36.200]   I was real close.
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.200]   You missed the peak by a buck.
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:39.200]   Yeah.
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.200]   Something like that.
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.200]   By .5%, he misses it.
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:47.200]   And actually, the sell order was into my broker in time to hit it, but he didn't
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.200]   execute for about 30 minutes.
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:51.200]   And so I got screwed out of XYZ dollars.
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.200]   I wouldn't be saying a word.
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:57.200]   That's what we in the business call a white wine.
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:59.200]   That's a real problem.
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:01.200]   But anyway, as...
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:07.200]   On the side of Jerusalem, none suffer as you suffer, Scott.
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:13.200]   But the news is that the entire stock market tank, Apple got punished, but so is everybody else.
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:16.200]   I do think some of it was part of the drawdown of the entire market.
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:19.200]   And some of it is just freaking perplexing to me.
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:24.200]   You have your best quarter ever, you surpass your analyst numbers.
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:26.200]   It's like, what do these people want?
[00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:31.200]   Do they want Steve Jobs to be able to find a way to make babies without pregnancy?
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:32.200]   I don't know.
[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:39.200]   So Apple, in the most recent quarter, sells 2.3 million max, more than ever.
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:41.200]   Up 50%.
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:48.200]   22.1 million iPods turns a $1.58 billion profit.
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.200]   It's greatest ever.
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:54.200]   Earnings per share, 54% up over the year ago.
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:57.200]   Revenue up 35% over a year ago.
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.200]   So that's good.
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:02.200]   Revenue was only up 35%, but earnings up 54%.
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:06.200]   And the market says, yeah, you're overvalued.
[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:08.200]   Yeah, you're overvalued.
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:13.200]   Was it because of the advisory that they gave at the end of the earnings call?
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:17.200]   I really can't make any sense of it, Leo.
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:23.200]   I looked at all the reports, as I always do, and I was just like, this is great news.
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:28.680]   I was kind of cussing myself for thinking, I wasn't going to be able to get back in, dollar
[00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:32.200]   cost average, my way back in at like 139, come up, whatever.
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:34.200]   And then I saw what happened.
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.200]   I was like, come on.
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.200]   This is just crazy.
[00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:43.200]   But I could say, remember, the entire market has just been slip sliding away here for the
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.200]   last couple of weeks.
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:48.200]   Well, but yeah, the Microsoft reported great earnings, also record earnings.
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:50.200]   And there's not one up.
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:55.200]   Well, Microsoft's cash on hand dwarfs that of like any 300 companies you want to mention
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:56.200]   too.
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.200]   So it's a little bit different story.
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:00.200]   Yeah, and Microsoft's been undervalued for a long time.
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:04.200]   Yeah, if you look at their cash on hand, it is a staggering number.
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.200]   And that's the number the street loves to look at.
[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:07.200]   Right.
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.920]   Well, what is Apple's cash on hand?
[00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:11.560]   I can't remember the exact, but let me tell you it's a fraction.
[00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:13.560]   It's a fraction of Microsoft's.
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.440]   Let me tell you how small it is comparatively.
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:22.200]   The interest income on Microsoft's cash on hand is greater than Apple's cash on hand.
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.920]   Yeah, I'm sure it is.
[00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:26.320]   It's greater in every way.
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:28.600]   Profits and everything else is greater.
[00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:31.400]   Still, I'm good, good, good job on Apple.
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:35.800]   And when you see Mac sales up 50%, that tells you switching is happening.
[00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:40.200]   Well, yeah, how many of you guys think it's, you know, I hate to say this, but I think
[00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:41.960]   there's a little halo effect from the iPhone.
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:43.480]   Oh, I think that's clear.
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:44.480]   Maybe.
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:46.120]   I mean, a lot of people are buying these machines.
[00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:47.120]   It's not me.
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:51.040]   However, you did also see the discrepancy between Apple's sales figures on the iPhone
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:56.080]   and AT&T's indicating that either a large number of phones are not being activated or
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:59.480]   more likely there's a lot of phones in stock.
[00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:04.200]   One analyst said there may be as many as 150 to 200 phones sitting in the back room of
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:05.600]   AT&T stores nationwide.
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:12.040]   How many, how much of those Mac sales do you think are people buying second or more
[00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:14.360]   Macs for themselves or the family?
[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:17.000]   I just bought my, I don't know what's fifth.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.480]   I'm just, I'm just falling inside of my butt.
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:24.560]   But like, what do you think the, if you had to guess on a ratio, the number of piece,
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:29.040]   like it's probably Apple's and orange is here, but to guess the number of PCs that household
[00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:33.080]   has versus the number of Macs that a Mac-centric house has.
[00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:36.000]   Do you think these, do you think that there's, I mean, because I'm guessing that some of
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.120]   these like Mac books, like in my family, like unbelievably Mac books are now what you send
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:44.080]   your kid to college with, which is something I never thought I would see.
[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:45.080]   Yeah.
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:48.080]   So I guess I'm just wondering, cause I wonder, I guess at the heart of it, I'm wondering
[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:52.960]   how much of that is penetration into areas they haven't been before totally and how much
[00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:58.760]   of it is deeper penetration, if you like, inside of an existing.
[00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:01.520]   Well, I think if you think of the iPhone as lube.
[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:03.080]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:06.600]   And if you think of an iPod as a hot dinner.
[00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.400]   I think we've got it there right there.
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:09.400]   Okay.
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:11.400]   I think we're going down a long slippery path is what I could.
[00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:16.800]   You could go up a halo effect or, you know, well, maybe I have very stuff right here.
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:19.160]   Single ladies up there, this is Andy Nautgo.
[00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:22.800]   I have nothing contributing to this really often.
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:25.640]   I remain the most dateable person in this group.
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:26.640]   I think that's true.
[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:27.640]   Oh boy.
[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:31.320]   That's a heck of a contest with for contact information.
[00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:32.320]   Available most of us.
[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.480]   That's a heck of a contest to win, Andy.
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:35.920]   You can be proud of that one.
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:38.360]   Okay, kids, let's get Philip Ryu on the line.
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:41.600]   We can continue this, continue this conversation afterwards.
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:45.680]   Philip is the, I think the creator of Mac heist.
[00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:47.760]   He also, he's been around the Mac community for a while.
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:51.920]   Let's just, let's just dial him in and get him to join the conversation.
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:53.160]   He might be a little hot under the collar.
[00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:56.880]   I wouldn't be surprised after our conversation with Mr. Segal.
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:59.080]   Although as you point out, hey, Philip.
[00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:00.600]   Hey, what's up?
[00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:01.600]   Great to have you.
[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:03.160]   Welcome to Mac Break Weekly.
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:04.800]   Andy Nautgo is on the line.
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:08.720]   Scott Born of Apple Phone Show, Merlin Mann, 43 folders.
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:11.280]   Philip, we're also going to have Andrew Welch join us.
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:15.920]   Should I Skype him or should I phone him or how should we get that going?
[00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:18.240]   Yeah, he's actually on Skype right now.
[00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:19.240]   Okay, all right.
[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:22.320]   Let me add him to the Skype pool.
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:30.480]   But first of all, as we've already mentioned, we talked last week with Rich Segal of Bear
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:32.800]   Bones software.
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:37.680]   Merlin, maybe, or Andy, one of you recap what he said, because I think I'm getting it wrong.
[00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:38.880]   Andy, why don't you do that?
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:41.160]   You probably took notes.
[00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:47.680]   The most bearish bone summary is that Rich personally feels as though it's a bad deal
[00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:53.520]   for developers because he feels as though, and if I'm misquoting Rich, I'm sure I'll
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:58.480]   hear about it and I'm sure I will apologize for it, he feels as though the monies that
[00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:04.040]   you will get as a developer are outstripped by the time you're going to be spending supporting
[00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:10.840]   all these brand new users, he also feels as though it may have a bad halo effect for someone's
[00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:19.280]   product because it devalues a certain product so that it's not being sold as a $49 thing
[00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:22.400]   anymore, it's being sold as one part of a $49 package.
[00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:25.360]   I think we do want to have Andrew Welch who we're going to get on in a second and respond
[00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:28.440]   to that as one of the premier developers in the Mac community.
[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:32.200]   I think he'll have something to say about it.
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:35.120]   Philip, this is the second Mac heist.
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:38.880]   When did you start it and why?
[00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:47.320]   The first Mac heist was last year during the fall and winter and we had basically kind
[00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:52.520]   of sat together on me and John Cassana and Scott Meinser.
[00:14:52.520 --> 00:15:00.120]   We started the company and I guess we were kind of discussing the whole idea of doing
[00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:07.440]   a software bundle, making it more entertaining and more exciting and kind of doing it right.
[00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:14.480]   So for a few months we were kind of conceptualizing this whole thing and then eventually it came
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:15.480]   together.
[00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:21.280]   We had the whole heist idea and theme.
[00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:24.360]   At that point we started working on it, put it together.
[00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:34.320]   I think we've launched in October and it was going directly after my dream app which had
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:36.000]   happened right before.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.440]   Which I participated in as a judge and I thought that was kind of neat.
[00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:44.680]   What is the status of the dream app by the way?
[00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:53.800]   So basically it kind of went through development hell and I'm in the process right now of rebooting
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:55.600]   it.
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:57.200]   I think you were finding it for cookbook.
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:59.560]   It worked your first priority.
[00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:02.400]   You also were a judge, weren't you Merlin?
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:03.400]   For my dream app?
[00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:10.840]   Yeah, I think something happened with the timing of the whole thing.
[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:14.720]   Merlin, we're losing you.
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:17.920]   Speak into the machine, Merlin.
[00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:18.920]   Hello, Merlin.
[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:23.800]   There's an end to the microphone that has a grill over it and then an end that has a plug
[00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:24.800]   in it.
[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:25.800]   You want to be speaking into the grill and...
[00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:26.800]   Oh, you're kidding.
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:27.800]   Wait a minute.
[00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:31.520]   All this time, we'll be more frustrated.
[00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:33.400]   I don't know what we've lost, but he was a judge on it.
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:34.400]   What was the winning app?
[00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:36.400]   It was a cookbook?
[00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:39.520]   Yeah, we actually had three winning apps.
[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:44.400]   Cookbook was the second place winner and first place was atmosphere.
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:45.560]   Oh, I remember that.
[00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:46.560]   That sounded so cool.
[00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:47.560]   Yeah.
[00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:54.040]   Yeah, atmosphere will be kind of our second priority as we get this all going again.
[00:16:54.040 --> 00:17:00.520]   And the third place was portal which was a consumer sinking application.
[00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:01.520]   Right.
[00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:04.400]   And that was also a pretty cool line.
[00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:11.000]   It has this whole visual hook of a wormhole opening up on your desktop and sucking in
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.760]   all the related files.
[00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:15.760]   Nobody gainsays the fact that you guys are great marketers.
[00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:18.040]   I mean, you really know how to do it.
[00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:19.880]   We had some criticism over the malcourse stunt.
[00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:22.760]   I'm sure you probably regret it now in retrospect.
[00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:24.920]   Yeah, I mean, the malcourse thing.
[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:27.320]   I mean, that was just terrible mistake.
[00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:28.320]   A bad idea.
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:29.320]   Everybody makes mistakes.
[00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:32.160]   I think we can forgive you on that.
[00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:34.440]   Let me get Andrew Welch on real quick.
[00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:37.680]   He's now on our Skype line and Merlin has dropped off.
[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:40.440]   We'll get Merlin back when he reboots his machine.
[00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:41.440]   Hey, Andrew.
[00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:42.440]   Hey, how you doing, Leo?
[00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:43.440]   Oh, it's great to talk to you.
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:46.880]   Andrew Welch is one of the legends in Mac development.
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:51.320]   You had two packages on Mac heist this time around, right?
[00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:54.640]   Was Wingnuts and SnapZ Pro?
[00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:59.840]   We had a bundle, which was the old SnapZ Pro X product.
[00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:03.720]   And then we also had a freebie, which was our old wiretap pro product.
[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:04.720]   WairTap.
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:05.720]   So Wingnuts wasn't yours.
[00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:06.720]   Okay, I'm sorry.
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:07.720]   No.
[00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:08.720]   Apologize.
[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:09.720]   You do some good games.
[00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:10.720]   That's why I was fooled.
[00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:11.720]   But Andrew's been around for ages.
[00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:16.680]   Ambrose, your software is one of the legends starting with, was it an Asteroids clone that
[00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:17.680]   you did first?
[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:21.880]   Yeah, that's one of the first games that people really knew about, but we were actually around
[00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:23.520]   for a while before then.
[00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:26.080]   So you have the stature of a rich sequel.
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:28.520]   You've been around as long as.
[00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:30.880]   What was your reaction when you heard Rich's comments?
[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:35.120]   Well, I've known Rich for a long time, and I very much respect Rich.
[00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:40.720]   I think he's a great guy, but I do disagree with some of his comments.
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:45.880]   And one of the interesting things is not Rich certainly, but other people who are commenting
[00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:49.560]   on the Mac heist and kind of giving it a negative spin.
[00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:55.960]   A lot of them haven't even been doing software anywhere near as long as we have.
[00:18:55.960 --> 00:19:01.080]   And I've looked at the list of caveats and complaints that some of the developers have
[00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:05.640]   had, and they don't really make any sense to me.
[00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:11.200]   Three of the major complaints are developers don't make enough money.
[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:14.080]   Developers haven't factored in support costs of all these new customers.
[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:20.240]   And if you're obtaining the customer at a dollar per customer, it's too expensive.
[00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:24.920]   And really the third one is that developers are devaluing their products, and the conversion
[00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:26.720]   rates aren't very good at upgrades.
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:27.720]   Rich made the last two points.
[00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:30.800]   I don't think he commented about how much anybody was making, because nobody really
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:31.800]   knows.
[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:34.400]   And I'm hoping Philip will give us some information on that.
[00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:35.400]   Sure.
[00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:39.800]   And we definitely went into the deal with our eyes wide open.
[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:42.480]   We approached last year and we turned it down.
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:46.160]   We approached this year and we said, yeah, well, we'll absolutely do it, because the business
[00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:47.960]   case for us was different.
[00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:51.600]   How has it changed from one to two?
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:54.760]   It changed in terms of the applications we're looking at bundling.
[00:19:54.760 --> 00:20:00.960]   It changed in terms of the lifecycle of the products that we're interested in bundling.
[00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:06.120]   We're actually in the middle of major upgrades to our Snaps Pro X product.
[00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:09.280]   So it makes pretty good sense to do it as a bundle now.
[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:16.160]   But I think one of the interesting things is that we've done deals like this before.
[00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:21.840]   We did a deal with Apple Computer where they'll bundle our games and our utilities on every
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:24.360]   computer that they sell.
[00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:30.560]   And believe me, they pay you very, very little for every computer that they sell.
[00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:35.560]   But we've had a number of our games and utilities bundle.
[00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:40.880]   Apple was selling millions of machines per quarter with our stuff bundled on there.
[00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:46.600]   We were getting less per customer than we're getting through Mac Heist.
[00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:51.120]   And we certainly didn't see any horrific support burden.
[00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:56.200]   And in fact, what we saw was some pretty fantastic name recognition that came out of
[00:20:56.200 --> 00:21:02.680]   that, as well as a lot of customers who then checked out our other products, upgraded to
[00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:06.800]   newer versions of our products when they were available.
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:10.440]   And all in all, that was a fantastic situation for us.
[00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:18.400]   And if we weren't really concerned about millions of computers with our software bundled in
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:23.840]   terms of the support burden, we're certainly not concerned about 50,000 Mac Heist bundles.
[00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:24.840]   Right.
[00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:26.080]   Scott, you made that point.
[00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:29.080]   You said, well, look, the developers going with their eyes open.
[00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:33.560]   Yeah, and I mean, he just articulated very specifically what a great business case it
[00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:35.120]   could be.
[00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:40.800]   As regards to the conversion rates for the bare bones people, I'm not denigrating their
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:41.800]   software in any way.
[00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:42.800]   I like it.
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:45.160]   But maybe their conversion rate wasn't good.
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:47.000]   Maybe their product didn't hit with the audience.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.720]   It doesn't mean everybody's conversion rate will be bad.
[00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:51.520]   Hey, BB Ed, it doesn't suck.
[00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:52.520]   Come on.
[00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:53.520]   I know.
[00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:54.520]   He doesn't love BB Ed.
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:55.840]   He uses it every day.
[00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:57.360]   Rich probably doesn't.
[00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:00.880]   There's a possibility that it didn't connect whatever reason.
[00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:05.160]   But the point is the exposure that you get because of shows like ours, which has, you
[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:08.000]   know, we have lots and lots of Mac listeners.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.120]   We're talking about this.
[00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:13.840]   This is exactly why if I were a developer, I'd want to be a part of this controversy or
[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:17.880]   not because, you know, you're getting some time that you literally cannot pay Leo the
[00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:18.880]   port for.
[00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:21.640]   He won't sell it to you, but he'll give it to you if he thinks.
[00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:23.480]   I'll sell it to anybody.
[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:25.040]   Not the editorial.
[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:27.040]   Just the ad.
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:32.640]   The other thing to mention is that, I mean, part of the game is just getting infiltration
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:34.400]   on someone's desktop.
[00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:38.280]   Just in the past week, I've come to really like and enjoy two apps that were part of
[00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:39.280]   that bundle.
[00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:40.280]   I did pay for it.
[00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:41.280]   I did not accept a freebie.
[00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:42.280]   I paid for the bundle.
[00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:43.280]   I did too.
[00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:44.280]   I bought it.
[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:47.920]   And you know, it's this wonderful thing where it's just there in your hard drive and then
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:49.480]   you're looking to solve a problem.
[00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:54.960]   That was when I was importing 600, 700 pictures that I took in one day on Tuesday at MacWorld
[00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:55.960]   Expo.
[00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:56.960]   I was seeing them flash buy and I photos.
[00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:58.920]   And you see, that's kind of an interesting movie.
[00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:02.720]   How do I convert that to a quick time I can put up on YouTube and then try a couple of
[00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:04.240]   things that I already had that didn't work.
[00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:09.320]   And then of course, as it happened, I had from the bundle, I had I-Stop Motion, which
[00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:10.320]   did a perfect job of it.
[00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:11.320]   That's a great program.
[00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:13.120]   I don't think anybody, I don't think anybody.
[00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:16.120]   I don't think it's not a program that I probably would have downloaded and paid for, but it
[00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:17.120]   woke me up this morning.
[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:18.120]   Yeah.
[00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:22.600]   And then we're going to have Jerry on Jerry Brace, the author of Awaken On.
[00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:26.520]   But I think the community decided Andrew would be an even better spokesman.
[00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:29.840]   I don't think anybody says that it's not a good deal for the customers.
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:30.840]   Of course not.
[00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:32.920]   I mean, it clearly is.
[00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:34.520]   And I mean, I got vector designer.
[00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:38.880]   You know, I bought both Mac high spondles, by the way, as much for as an ex, to see what
[00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:40.360]   you'd get as anything else.
[00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:42.040]   But I have to say, I've used a number of the programs.
[00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:44.640]   Of course, I'd already paid for Snaps Pro.
[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:46.400]   I'd already paid for Wiretapp.
[00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:49.200]   I've already paid for a lot of this stuff on there.
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:50.200]   Sure.
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:55.160]   One of the interesting things from our perspective is that we have done other promotions in the
[00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:56.320]   past.
[00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:59.600]   Last year, as I mentioned, we didn't do the Mac heist promotion.
[00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:03.040]   We did the Mac Santa promotion instead.
[00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:07.960]   And that was actually pretty dismal in terms of, you know, we saw a slight boost in sales,
[00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:12.520]   but it wasn't particularly promoted well.
[00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:17.320]   So it's interesting being part of the Mac heist, where people are saying, well, you
[00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:20.000]   know, this is going to devalue the product.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.240]   The consumers are going to expect to pay less for software.
[00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:27.560]   And I really don't agree with that because I think consumers, especially the American
[00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:32.200]   Sumer, are very used to crazy Christmas time specials, for instance.
[00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:34.240]   Stores will run blowout sales.
[00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:38.840]   And it doesn't devalue the product that the stores are selling the rest of the year.
[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:42.500]   And the average consumer is smart enough to know, well, I'm not going to pay this kind
[00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:43.560]   of price all the time.
[00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:46.480]   This is a special promotional event.
[00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:49.080]   And I think the consumer looks at it from that point of view that, hey, I'm going to
[00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:54.320]   save a lot of money, not, hey, wow, suddenly software is worth less money, you know?
[00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:57.680]   Let me raise the Gruber objection for you, Philip.
[00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:03.320]   And last time, Mac heist won John, throughout some numbers that looked pretty bad for the
[00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:04.320]   developer.
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:08.240]   It looked like you guys made millions, maybe not millions, hundreds of thousands of dollars,
[00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:11.760]   and developers made pennies on the dollar.
[00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:12.940]   What's your response to that?
[00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:16.100]   And can you talk about numbers for this particular heist?
[00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:18.300]   Yeah, sure.
[00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:24.380]   So basically the numbers that Gruber came up with last year, they were, you know, he
[00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:26.140]   marked them as speculation.
[00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:30.100]   And they were heavily, you know, pretty heavy speculations.
[00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:38.740]   Like the numbers were probably, I don't know, I'd say like 50 to like 80% off or something.
[00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:45.620]   So still low, I mean, if they were only 80% off, that's still fairly low.
[00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:50.320]   Yeah, I mean, what we did last year was, you know, when we started talking to these
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:57.500]   developers, we had no idea what kind of a success Mac be.
[00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:03.660]   And we felt that, you know, at the time, us coming from kind of nowhere that developers
[00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:09.220]   would be more secure with like a guaranteed flat fee.
[00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:12.500]   So you know, it kind of blew up in a good way.
[00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:18.940]   And in the end, we ended up bonusing them double their fees.
[00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:21.860]   And this year we're doing, we're doing percentage rates.
[00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:24.620]   I imagine every developer gets a different deal.
[00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:26.460]   Is that correct or is there a flat rate?
[00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:32.580]   Yeah, I mean, you know, obviously some of these applications, we basically negotiate
[00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:40.660]   rates based on perceived value and how popular these apps are, even their price tag.
[00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:46.820]   So you know, like the rates are different and I can't really go into discussing specific
[00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:49.940]   figures for free developers.
[00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:53.180]   But you know, I can tell you that.
[00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:57.580]   I mean, this is just private financial, financial info.
[00:26:57.580 --> 00:27:02.140]   Like I don't think any of the developers would want their private deals, you know, just
[00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:05.980]   like, and not the ones who are getting a lot.
[00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:07.980]   Andrew, do you want to talk about numbers?
[00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:10.460]   I mean, it's no, absolutely not.
[00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:11.460]   Okay.
[00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:14.460]   We also are software publishers.
[00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:15.460]   Okay.
[00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:20.460]   So we often are working with developers and we will sell a product and give them a percentage
[00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:21.460]   when we sell it.
[00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:22.460]   You don't disclose that.
[00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:24.140]   And we don't disclose that info.
[00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:25.140]   Let's put it this way.
[00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:28.580]   Are you obviously, I would guess, are you happy with the numbers?
[00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:29.860]   Are you ecstatic with the numbers?
[00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:32.740]   Are you merely satisfied with the numbers?
[00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:37.900]   Well, you know, as I tried to allude to earlier, the money really didn't have much to do with
[00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:39.380]   why we're doing the Mac Heist.
[00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:44.940]   We saw it as a really nice promotional opportunity given the life cycle of the products that we're
[00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:46.900]   interested in bundling.
[00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:48.060]   I think the money is great.
[00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:53.460]   I mean, we made more money from doing the Mac Heist bundle than we ever did from bundling
[00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:56.620]   any single product with Apple Computer.
[00:27:56.620 --> 00:27:58.180]   And they sold millions of computers.
[00:27:58.180 --> 00:27:59.180]   Okay.
[00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:01.860]   But again, the money was really secondary consideration.
[00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:08.700]   We're looking at this more as a really nice promotional tool for us to use.
[00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:16.940]   I just want to point out that developers this year are pretty much earning the lion's
[00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:20.860]   share of the profits.
[00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:23.020]   So that's definitely like a misconception.
[00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:28.060]   You know, that the Mac Heist organizers are running away to some island with millions
[00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:31.140]   dollars or whatever in our pockets.
[00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:35.980]   And you also told me in an email, all the bundles are full, all the apps are full licenses.
[00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:38.580]   They're not, you know, one time only deals.
[00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:42.340]   Yeah, I think Rich mentioned that last week.
[00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:49.820]   He was saying that, you know, a lot of the bundle apps were limited licenses or whatever.
[00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:51.980]   And that's definitely not true.
[00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:59.460]   He had a couple, a couple bonus apps that people could earn and they weren't necessarily the
[00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:00.460]   same situation.
[00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:05.620]   But in terms of like all the apps that you get when you purchase a bundle, yeah, they're
[00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:07.220]   all full licenses.
[00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:09.900]   Andrew, you said that this is end of life for snaps.
[00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:14.420]   Does that mean I'm buying something that's kind of old?
[00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:17.740]   No, I mean, it's still a fantastic product.
[00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:18.740]   It is.
[00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:19.740]   I use it all the time, actually.
[00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:20.740]   Yeah.
[00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:23.420]   So we're working on a major new upgrade to that product.
[00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:29.260]   And we've talked about that with people we've met up with at the Macworld Expo and such.
[00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:35.300]   And really, we ran into a lot of people that said they purchased the Mac Heist bundle just
[00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:36.300]   to get snaps.
[00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:37.300]   Right.
[00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:39.940]   And there'll be other people that there'll be one particular app in there that they really
[00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:41.860]   want as well.
[00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:46.580]   So the thing you have to keep in mind as a developer is just because they sell say 50,000
[00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:47.580]   bundles.
[00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:49.740]   That doesn't mean you have 50,000 new customers.
[00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:53.660]   And a lot of people may just want one particular product.
[00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:58.620]   We actually figured that we'd probably get about one out of every eight bundles would
[00:29:58.620 --> 00:30:02.500]   be a new customer for us to one extent or another.
[00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:06.660]   And what privileges will I have to upgrade on the next version?
[00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:08.340]   Oh, full privileges.
[00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:10.340]   I mean, that's the reason why we did it.
[00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:14.140]   We want to have a nice customer base for the new version of our product.
[00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:15.140]   Oh, that's cool.
[00:30:15.140 --> 00:30:18.180]   Can I ask a question to Andrew?
[00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:19.180]   Sure.
[00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:20.180]   Really, it's Merlin.
[00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:21.180]   I'm just curious.
[00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:26.140]   I think when I look at stuff like this or really pretty much anything, I always think
[00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:30.740]   it's valuable to try and bring some nuance to it by saying, well, you know, if you look
[00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:34.180]   at things on a continuum, you know, that there's some things that are wrong for everybody
[00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:36.460]   and there's some things that are right for everybody.
[00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:38.940]   And I think it's interesting to think about.
[00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:41.940]   So for people, if you were giving advice as somebody who's been around forever, and by
[00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:45.100]   the way, I seem to remember playing your games a really long time ago.
[00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:47.420]   I've been around Easter stuff for a while.
[00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:49.420]   Yeah, thanks for reminding me how old I am.
[00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:50.420]   I appreciate it.
[00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:52.460]   I've been playing your games since I was a kid, Andrew.
[00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:53.460]   Did you make maelstrom?
[00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:54.460]   Yes.
[00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:55.460]   Yeah, maelstrom.
[00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:57.820]   I think I lost about two years of my life.
[00:30:57.820 --> 00:31:01.140]   That was the one I was talking about.
[00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:02.380]   That was kind of an asteroid's clone.
[00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:04.380]   Yeah, well, thanks a lot.
[00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:05.380]   I'm just kidding.
[00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:06.380]   I love maelstrom.
[00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:07.380]   I'm just curious.
[00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:10.860]   So like, same similar question to what I asked for it's last week.
[00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:15.540]   If you're out there talking to folks about deciding to be in one bundle or another,
[00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:18.060]   I would abstract this not to totally change the topic.
[00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:23.860]   But in deciding whether you want to be in a bundle, who is a bundle good and bad for?
[00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:29.180]   And what are the kind of things that you look for in terms of terms?
[00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:32.300]   Well, it really is going to vary quite a bit.
[00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:34.540]   I mean, like I said, we turn it down.
[00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:35.540]   Maybe who it's best for?
[00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:36.540]   Who do you think?
[00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:39.180]   So if you're out there and you're going, like, who can you unreservedly say you should
[00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:43.260]   participate in a bundle based on if you can get terms somewhere to this?
[00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:47.980]   Yeah, I think if you're a new developer and you're really looking to gain a little bit
[00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:52.340]   of mind share and market share and don't mind taking a little bit of a hit up front,
[00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:54.380]   then I think it would be a fantastic thing to do.
[00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:59.620]   I mean, it's a pretty common concept that you'll have a loss leader, you know, to bring
[00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:03.220]   people into your store, so to speak.
[00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:07.820]   And to have a really good app that's just not getting any recognition would be a great
[00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:10.180]   thing to bring into this bundle, I think.
[00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:14.940]   And if you had like, if you've been working on something and it was a, you had a lot of
[00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:18.780]   person hours on it over a long period of time, is that the kind of thing you'd want to launch
[00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:21.500]   in a bundle or would you want to do that independently?
[00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:27.180]   Honestly, I would try to divorce the decision making process by how much time I put into
[00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:33.620]   it because, you know, and that actually is a trap that developers can fall into.
[00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:37.180]   They say, oh God, you know, I worked on this for years and years.
[00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:40.340]   It's got to be, it's got to be worth more than that.
[00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:41.580]   I can't possibly do that.
[00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:45.780]   Well, you really have to divorce yourself from that and try and figure out not how much time
[00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:49.300]   do I spend on it, but what's the smartest thing to do for this product based on where
[00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:50.300]   it's at?
[00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:51.300]   Yeah.
[00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:54.060]   Philip, is there anything else you'd like to say before we wrap this up?
[00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:58.940]   I mean, I know one thing I'd like you to mention is how much money you raise for charity.
[00:32:58.940 --> 00:32:59.940]   Oh, yeah.
[00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:04.540]   I mean, you know, that's the other great part about Mac guys, for the developers and for
[00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:09.300]   us and everyone involved is that you get to take part in probably like the biggest
[00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:13.300]   chartel event in the Mac community of the year.
[00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:21.580]   We ended up raising $490,000 or a little under that for the charities involved and
[00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:24.500]   we topped that off to half-melon.
[00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:26.900]   So that was a huge surprise.
[00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:27.900]   That's pretty great.
[00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:33.300]   I think it's, now the sense I'm getting is that when you did it the first time, you guys
[00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:38.860]   had no idea how much money it was going to pour in and you've responded to the criticisms
[00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:41.580]   this time around and you've done it in much more equitably.
[00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:43.380]   You've added the charity.
[00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:44.380]   Yeah.
[00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:49.500]   And I have to say you've kind of assuaged any fears I might have had.
[00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:51.140]   I'm not not withstanding what Rich says.
[00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:52.820]   Maybe there are some people who it's not right for.
[00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:54.780]   I think that's all Rich really was saying.
[00:33:54.780 --> 00:33:55.780]   Yeah.
[00:33:55.780 --> 00:34:00.100]   And Leo, if you don't mind, it's a it's a generous one of chime in real quick.
[00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:05.500]   I think certainly it will be appropriate for some developers and not appropriate and that
[00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:07.100]   will change over time.
[00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:11.500]   But the other thing to keep in mind is I mean these guys are running a business.
[00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:15.660]   Everyone knew what the terms were up front and the amount of scrutiny that this business
[00:34:15.660 --> 00:34:17.500]   is seeing is a little bit sick.
[00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:18.900]   I mean it's kind of impressive.
[00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:26.200]   Well, if you imagine if you went up to Microsoft or Apple and said, hey, we want to see exactly
[00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:29.500]   how much you're making on each unit and we think you're making too much on each unit.
[00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:31.220]   You don't think this is fair.
[00:34:31.220 --> 00:34:33.260]   They'd look at you and be like, what are you kidding?
[00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:34.260]   Right.
[00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:36.060]   I don't know if I totally agree with that.
[00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:42.940]   I mean, because I think it feels like Mac Heist gets, I don't know if it's deliberately marketed
[00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:46.540]   this way, but it feels like there's several conversations going on at one time, especially
[00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:47.940]   with the first round.
[00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:51.340]   So I think bringing a measure of skepticism to it is not crazy.
[00:34:51.340 --> 00:34:55.940]   I think you guys have an opportunity to say, hey, look, this is awesome and everybody wins
[00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:57.340]   is totally legitimate.
[00:34:57.340 --> 00:35:01.020]   But at the same time, if you're going to bring in stuff like, oh, and this goes to charity
[00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:04.660]   and that, well, if you start bringing charity in the equation, then people do ask questions.
[00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:07.660]   And if you're making that a selling point of it, so I don't think people are doing it
[00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:08.660]   to be jerks.
[00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:13.340]   I think they're just trying to say, well, we just need to talk about one conversation
[00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:14.340]   at a time.
[00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:15.340]   Do you know what I mean?
[00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:16.340]   Yeah.
[00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:18.180]   No, I absolutely agree with you, especially the charity angle.
[00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:21.700]   I do agree that people will want transparency.
[00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:26.060]   And I think it's fantastic that they're donating quite a bit of money to charity.
[00:35:26.060 --> 00:35:28.540]   And that's a nice sum there.
[00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:32.860]   And I think it makes sense to have a conversation about, well, is this a good deal for developers?
[00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:35.300]   Yes, no, here's why, here's not why.
[00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:40.500]   But I guess what I was talking about more was their internal finances in terms of how
[00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:42.580]   much money are they making.
[00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:43.580]   I don't know.
[00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:46.580]   I guess I think that's their business to an extent.
[00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:47.580]   It is.
[00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:49.140]   And I'll shut up after this.
[00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:53.140]   But the only reason I think it's an interesting question is because we're not talking about
[00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:58.260]   Microsoft and we're not talking about, gosh, how many big Mac software companies are there
[00:35:58.260 --> 00:35:59.780]   that aren't independent anymore.
[00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:03.340]   But I think when you also bring in that angle of saying, hey, this is independent, it helps
[00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:04.340]   the developers.
[00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:08.180]   Obviously, you guys are saying legitimately, it sounds like, hey, our developers are happy
[00:36:08.180 --> 00:36:09.540]   because they participated.
[00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:10.780]   Nobody held a gun to their head.
[00:36:10.780 --> 00:36:13.620]   But again, when you bring in the angle of the charity and then you bring in the angle of
[00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:19.060]   the indie, and I think for me, it's the same thing with indie labels for music.
[00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:23.100]   You like to know that the people that you're supporting are getting a good deal.
[00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:25.700]   It's not unusual for me to know what George Clooney made in a movie.
[00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:27.460]   I mean, I know what the grips made.
[00:36:27.460 --> 00:36:30.300]   But if he's the focus of the movie, it's not unusual for that information to be out.
[00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:34.060]   So I'm not saying, I don't think talking about money is always the most interesting
[00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:35.060]   conversation.
[00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:36.060]   But I don't know.
[00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:38.340]   It sounds to me like you guys are doing stuff for different this time.
[00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:39.340]   That's really cool.
[00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:40.340]   I just, I.
[00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:41.620]   Also, welcome to the Mac community.
[00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:46.100]   I mean, if you've done this in the Windows world, I doubt you would have received this
[00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:47.100]   kind of scrutiny.
[00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:49.060]   The Mac community is a little bit different.
[00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:50.060]   We eat our own.
[00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:51.060]   We eat our own.
[00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:58.900]   Yeah, and here's kind of my other thought on this is that people will look at it and they'll
[00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:02.580]   say, oh my God, they sold 50,000 bundles.
[00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:05.420]   They brought in $2 million.
[00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:07.620]   These guys are getting rich, right?
[00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:15.260]   But they have no idea what the advertising costs, the employee costs, all of the expenses
[00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:17.380]   that they had in there.
[00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:23.980]   And it really kind of forces the people at Mac Kice to have to reveal their internal
[00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:26.660]   financial data, which I don't know.
[00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:30.740]   If someone came up to me and asked me, you know, what do you mean to yourselves and what
[00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:31.740]   are you making?
[00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:32.740]   I'd say, go away.
[00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:33.740]   You know?
[00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:37.260]   Every point of the question, when did it become a crime to get rich for that matter?
[00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:38.260]   I mean, what's wrong?
[00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:39.260]   If they are getting rich, who cares?
[00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:40.260]   Who's business is it?
[00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:41.260]   It's a matter of...
[00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:43.260]   Read or lack of a better word.
[00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:46.260]   Read or use a word.
[00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:52.260]   Everybody who isn't rich wants to be rich and everybody who is rich is a greedy under
[00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:53.260]   those.
[00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:57.260]   Well, I'd also like to point out that the people who reveal their finances like Twit
[00:37:57.260 --> 00:37:59.140]   are people who aren't making any money.
[00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:02.060]   And it's the ones who are making money who suddenly clam up.
[00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:03.060]   Okay?
[00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:04.060]   I just want to...
[00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:07.860]   How often have I told you about my 1997 Cordoba over to them, bro?
[00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:08.860]   Exactly.
[00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:09.860]   I'll tell you exactly how much we're not making.
[00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:11.740]   I am an honest journalist.
[00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:15.860]   I would like to be on the take, but I've had no offers as yet, so I can plead.
[00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:18.460]   I can plead, you know, the upper high ground.
[00:38:18.460 --> 00:38:21.060]   I'll pay off a little bit later on.
[00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:22.060]   Listen, I've got a...
[00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:23.060]   Yeah, we're going to let you go.
[00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:24.060]   We're going to let you go.
[00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:26.340]   We're going to have a appointment I've got to get to so you guys can finish up.
[00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:29.460]   I appreciate you having me on there, but I've really got a role.
[00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:33.340]   Well, also, let me say this that Andrew Welch and Ambrosia Software have more Mac picks
[00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:35.500]   on this show than any other company.
[00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:39.060]   Wiretap, eye toner, snaps.
[00:38:39.060 --> 00:38:40.700]   I think we picked Sketch Fighter, Scott.
[00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:42.180]   You loved Sketch Fighter.
[00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:43.180]   So...
[00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:44.180]   Everything they made.
[00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:45.180]   Pretty much everything they made.
[00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:48.900]   That's good to know and we're going to have more stuff for you to pick real soon.
[00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:49.900]   Thank you, Andrew.
[00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:50.900]   I really appreciate your time.
[00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:51.900]   Thank you.
[00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:52.900]   Take care.
[00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:53.900]   And mail stream.
[00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:54.900]   Awesome.
[00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:55.900]   Awesome.
[00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:56.900]   Got to update that for OS 10, though.
[00:38:56.900 --> 00:38:57.900]   And Phillip, I do thank you for your time.
[00:38:57.900 --> 00:39:03.020]   I hope that you feel like you've been treated fairly here and you got in the information
[00:39:03.020 --> 00:39:04.500]   you wanted to get in.
[00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:05.500]   Yeah.
[00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:09.060]   You know, we really both appreciate the offer.
[00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:15.140]   And I think this will help a lot kind of mitigate some of the false perceptions about
[00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:16.140]   the whole event.
[00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:17.140]   I agree.
[00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:20.180]   I think the Mac community wanted to know this and I think having heard this, I think any
[00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:22.260]   reasonable person is going to say, "Okay, cool."
[00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:24.060]   And I can't wait to Mac Heist III.
[00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:25.060]   Yeah.
[00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:26.460]   You got another one coming?
[00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:27.460]   Yep.
[00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:33.100]   You know, I can't say when yet, but we're definitely going to start planning that soon.
[00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:34.100]   Good.
[00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:35.100]   Phillip, thanks for your time.
[00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:36.100]   Yeah.
[00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:38.300]   Thank you so much for having us on.
[00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:39.300]   That's great.
[00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:44.460]   Mac Heist, too late now to participate, but I'm sure there'll be another coming down the
[00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:45.460]   road.
[00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:49.980]   We have now room to add Alex Lindsey, who is back from the dead.
[00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:50.980]   Hi, Alex.
[00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:51.980]   Hello.
[00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:52.980]   How you feeling?
[00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:53.980]   I'm feeling better.
[00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:54.980]   I'm just stuffed up.
[00:39:54.980 --> 00:39:55.980]   I feel fine.
[00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:57.220]   You sound like a different human.
[00:39:57.220 --> 00:39:58.220]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:39:58.220 --> 00:40:01.060]   You sound like I sounded last week is actually what you sound like.
[00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:02.060]   Yeah.
[00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:06.060]   And I want to apologize for giving you my whatever my disease is.
[00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:07.060]   Yeah.
[00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:09.060]   I didn't use your headset because I was afraid of your headset.
[00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:10.860]   It's all those SM58s floating around.
[00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:11.860]   Yeah.
[00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:12.860]   I was kind of...
[00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:13.860]   I was...
[00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:14.860]   You're fine with those.
[00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:15.860]   Yeah.
[00:40:15.860 --> 00:40:16.860]   That's exactly.
[00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:17.860]   I apologize.
[00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:18.860]   Scott, did you...
[00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:19.860]   You didn't get sick.
[00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:20.860]   Did you just go?
[00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:22.500]   I did not get sick because I had already been sick.
[00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:28.300]   I think that the fact that I made sure that the Condo Association installed Purell where
[00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:30.740]   they used to run water in my shower.
[00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:33.140]   Purell was Andy and Akos secret, too.
[00:40:33.140 --> 00:40:38.700]   Yes, I ran through four three ounce bottles of Purell starting at Boston's Logan Airport
[00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:40.860]   and ending at Boston's Logan Airport.
[00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:42.460]   It's a secret of fine cruise ships everywhere.
[00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:44.860]   That's the saddest parade I've ever heard.
[00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:45.860]   Exactly.
[00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:48.140]   You know, I was really happy.
[00:40:48.140 --> 00:40:49.140]   It is great because...
[00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:50.980]   I was having this debate with Andy, I think, about this.
[00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:51.980]   At least mentally.
[00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:55.420]   I was like, "Should we shake hands and then immediately in front of each other put our
[00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:59.060]   Purell on or should we try to turn around and hide?"
[00:40:59.060 --> 00:41:03.060]   At the show, it turned into this very nice social bonding thing where I would shake hands
[00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:06.100]   with somebody, then take up my Purell, then offer them a squirt.
[00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:08.380]   We love, you know, rub our hands.
[00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:09.380]   You know?
[00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:12.260]   Scott looked really good in that three piece hazmat suit.
[00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:16.860]   You know, Tyvek can be very flattering.
[00:41:16.860 --> 00:41:17.860]   Yeah.
[00:41:17.860 --> 00:41:19.820]   I got the Hawaiian shirt version, though.
[00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:24.340]   I should probably apologize for everybody I met at Macworld and I imagine I was kind
[00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:27.100]   of a typhoid Mary there.
[00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:28.100]   Patients...
[00:41:28.100 --> 00:41:30.060]   There were a lot of people that were typhoid Mary.
[00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:32.300]   That's a nasty cold that's going around.
[00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:33.300]   This is going to happen every year.
[00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:34.300]   I mean, this is like a legend.
[00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:35.300]   I was reading this on the Twitter.
[00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:38.900]   Apparently, everybody says, "Every year this happens at Macworld, something brutal
[00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:40.540]   fells every Mac nerd."
[00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:41.540]   It's worse than CES.
[00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:43.540]   It happens at CES as well.
[00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:44.540]   Just the time.
[00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:45.540]   Those guys never get out of their basement.
[00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:47.540]   You know, they need that fresh air really knock some off.
[00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:52.540]   I heard it was a bug, a super bug planted by Bill Gates.
[00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:54.380]   I don't know.
[00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:56.780]   Moving on to other Mac stories this week.
[00:41:56.780 --> 00:42:02.900]   I think we're done with the Apple quarterly results, which they released one minute after
[00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:04.700]   we got off the air last week.
[00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:08.500]   Look for them to get back to 200 soon.
[00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:10.220]   You think they're going to come back?
[00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:16.420]   We mentioned the money that Scott lost by selling a couple cents off the high.
[00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:17.420]   He lost...
[00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:19.300]   Probably given the number of shares he had.
[00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:21.660]   He probably wasn't in a significant amount of money.
[00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:23.980]   That's got a rounding error.
[00:42:23.980 --> 00:42:24.980]   Yeah.
[00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:27.940]   It's just not talk about that part of the transaction.
[00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:31.740]   So you're saying Scott, Apple's a deal right now.
[00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:37.340]   If it were not for my particular circumstances, I would buy as much as I had again times two.
[00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:38.340]   But I can't do that.
[00:42:38.340 --> 00:42:39.820]   I'm not giving anybody advice to do that.
[00:42:39.820 --> 00:42:44.100]   But I'm simply saying that I predict as I did before that it will hit 200.
[00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:45.100]   It will hit 200.
[00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:46.100]   I think it will go to 250.
[00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:47.100]   Wow.
[00:42:47.100 --> 00:42:48.100]   Wow.
[00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:53.740]   I think the company is drastically undervalued if these numbers are any kind of port 10 of
[00:42:53.740 --> 00:42:54.740]   things to come.
[00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:58.300]   Now, if they did caution, they did caution that it won't be as big next quarter.
[00:42:58.300 --> 00:43:03.820]   Well, that's a traditional second quarter, kind of undoing thing that they've gone through
[00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:05.420]   before.
[00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:10.980]   If we were to see anything in the line fall flat, if we got flat iPhone sales, if we got
[00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:13.980]   flat Mac sales, then that would change my opinion.
[00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:20.580]   But right now, I mean, if they were worth $200 a little while ago, they sure look like
[00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:23.980]   they're worth what they're charging for the stock now.
[00:43:23.980 --> 00:43:26.580]   Anybody rented any movies on iTunes yet?
[00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:29.660]   I got Raptor Tui from my flight home from San Francisco.
[00:43:29.660 --> 00:43:30.660]   Oh, you mentioned that.
[00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:31.660]   Yeah.
[00:43:31.660 --> 00:43:32.660]   What did you read, Alex?
[00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:34.660]   Did you like it?
[00:43:34.660 --> 00:43:37.540]   I rented the lives of others.
[00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:39.460]   Oh, I want to see that badly.
[00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:41.380]   Now, here's the question.
[00:43:41.380 --> 00:43:43.420]   Should I put that on Netflix or should I get it from iTunes?
[00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:45.420]   Well, here's the thing.
[00:43:45.420 --> 00:43:50.540]   It for the 10 minutes that I saw, it looked great because I got sick about the same time
[00:43:50.540 --> 00:43:53.660]   that I thought that I'd be able to watch it while I was there.
[00:43:53.660 --> 00:43:55.220]   So it expired.
[00:43:55.220 --> 00:43:57.940]   Instead, I ended up going to sleep.
[00:43:57.940 --> 00:44:01.020]   My wife watched it and I didn't get to watch it because of the 24 hour thing.
[00:44:01.020 --> 00:44:03.740]   So I'm already chafed about it.
[00:44:03.740 --> 00:44:08.460]   In fact, I started actually deciding that I was going to look at all of the different
[00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:09.900]   things that you can do online.
[00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:14.140]   So the Hulu and ABC and iTunes and everything else.
[00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:17.460]   And I think the video quality is still highest on iTunes.
[00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:19.860]   You don't mean when you're going to rent something or watch it.
[00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:25.140]   You have to pay for it, but you are getting something for what you're paying for.
[00:44:25.140 --> 00:44:31.260]   According to Mac News Network, Apple has quietly extended the amount of time.
[00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:32.260]   Not very much.
[00:44:32.260 --> 00:44:36.540]   I mean, all they're doing is making sure that you can continue to watch them film after
[00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:38.500]   the 24 hours, but you have to keep on watching it.
[00:44:38.500 --> 00:44:42.180]   So it's just that you have to finish it in other words.
[00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:43.180]   Yeah.
[00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:44.180]   Uh oh.
[00:44:44.180 --> 00:44:45.740]   Somebody's sending a lot of a...
[00:44:45.740 --> 00:44:46.740]   That's not me.
[00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:51.780]   Also, Chris, I think Chris Brain told me about this little trick where you can sort of...
[00:44:51.780 --> 00:44:56.940]   If you keep it on pause and you don't leave the movie viewer, you can extend that by quite
[00:44:56.940 --> 00:44:57.940]   a bit.
[00:44:57.940 --> 00:45:01.220]   So as long as you don't make or place any phone calls, read any email or check out on
[00:45:01.220 --> 00:45:03.900]   any website, you can keep RAS or 2E for an entire week if you want.
[00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:04.900]   That seems plausible.
[00:45:04.900 --> 00:45:07.980]   Well, that's that thing where you get to finish it, but if you stop it at any point, that's
[00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:09.940]   it you're done.
[00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:10.940]   You can pause it.
[00:45:10.940 --> 00:45:11.940]   You can't stop it, right?
[00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:13.500]   You can pause it, right?
[00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:16.180]   The shot clock seems to pause along with the movie.
[00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:18.180]   So long as you don't leave the application.
[00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:19.180]   That's something...
[00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:23.100]   So it seems like in my situation where you have a computer that's just doing video, that
[00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:25.780]   would actually work really well.
[00:45:25.780 --> 00:45:26.780]   Maybe.
[00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:27.780]   I don't...
[00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:28.780]   It does sound like something...
[00:45:28.780 --> 00:45:33.260]   It does sound like the sort of thing that a developer at Apple caught but decided not
[00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:36.900]   to fix, but now that it gets publicized, it will be fixed in the next update.
[00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:37.900]   It doesn't seem like...
[00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:42.060]   It sounds like the sort of thing that Apple would quietly sort of fix.
[00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:43.060]   So it's a mistake.
[00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:45.060]   It sounds more of a hour's mistake.
[00:45:45.060 --> 00:45:46.620]   It's a huge mistake.
[00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:50.420]   And I'm going to go on joining just about everybody I know to go on the record and say
[00:45:50.420 --> 00:45:52.620]   that this has to change for this to succeed.
[00:45:52.620 --> 00:45:55.340]   I'm not going to go buy this stuff under that restriction.
[00:45:55.340 --> 00:45:57.500]   The whole like 30 days to watch a thing?
[00:45:57.500 --> 00:45:58.500]   Like who cares?
[00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:00.820]   Five days to watch it, but I can do it.
[00:46:00.820 --> 00:46:01.820]   You know, I look at it this way.
[00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:05.620]   I remember in the early 90s, there was a really cool video store in my neighborhood in Tallahassee.
[00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:08.860]   And when they were one of the first ones I remember going to like the whole "Keep this
[00:46:08.860 --> 00:46:10.580]   for three days" or whatever thing.
[00:46:10.580 --> 00:46:13.020]   You remember like what it used to be when you rented a movie?
[00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:14.020]   "Pay by the day."
[00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:15.020]   It was due back.
[00:46:15.020 --> 00:46:16.020]   Like before noon the next day.
[00:46:16.020 --> 00:46:17.020]   Yeah.
[00:46:17.020 --> 00:46:18.020]   Which was crazy.
[00:46:18.020 --> 00:46:19.020]   And you always rented one movie at a time.
[00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:23.140]   But once they started doing that, I found myself renting five movies at a time.
[00:46:23.140 --> 00:46:24.140]   And it's...
[00:46:24.140 --> 00:46:28.300]   So again, I mean, what do you learn from this particular kind of economy of scale of the
[00:46:28.300 --> 00:46:32.540]   internet is that people like consuming large amounts of stuff whenever they feel like
[00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:33.540]   it.
[00:46:33.540 --> 00:46:35.340]   And so this is a really half-ass measure.
[00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:37.660]   If they don't change that to three days, I just...
[00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:38.980]   I think a lot of people will try it.
[00:46:38.980 --> 00:46:40.940]   And I think a lot of people won't stay with it.
[00:46:40.940 --> 00:46:44.820]   I think it really does demonstrate though, where Apple sees this feature going.
[00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:48.860]   They don't see this as a mobile movie viewing experience.
[00:46:48.860 --> 00:46:50.380]   They see this as an Apple TV.
[00:46:50.380 --> 00:46:51.660]   Sit down in front of your computer.
[00:46:51.660 --> 00:46:52.820]   Decide what you want to watch.
[00:46:52.820 --> 00:46:53.820]   Watch it.
[00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:54.820]   And then that's it.
[00:46:54.820 --> 00:46:55.820]   It's experienced.
[00:46:55.820 --> 00:46:56.820]   You see it that way?
[00:46:56.820 --> 00:47:02.780]   It's useful to help us to figure out exactly what Apple was thinking about.
[00:47:02.780 --> 00:47:04.500]   What Apple's planning for this exact feature.
[00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:08.780]   Again, I'm sure that they're thrilled to make sure that it works on every single device
[00:47:08.780 --> 00:47:10.540]   they have an Apple logo on it.
[00:47:10.540 --> 00:47:14.500]   But the fact that they would see if they can get away with 24 hours means that they're
[00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:16.460]   thinking, "Well, geez, you know, you sit down on the sofa.
[00:47:16.460 --> 00:47:17.460]   You rent the Simpsons movie.
[00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:18.460]   You watch the Simpsons movie.
[00:47:18.460 --> 00:47:21.540]   It's not going to take you three days to watch the Simpsons movies in your living room."
[00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:26.340]   I think that if organically they were thinking, "Oh, well, people are going to buy this in
[00:47:26.340 --> 00:47:32.020]   their hotel room on a business trip and they'll watch a little bit in the hotel room, then
[00:47:32.020 --> 00:47:34.780]   a little bit in the lounge, waiting for their flight, then a little bit on their flight later
[00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:36.620]   on, and then finish it up at home."
[00:47:36.620 --> 00:47:40.820]   I think that if they were in that sort of mind space, they would have given us 48 hours
[00:47:40.820 --> 00:47:42.460]   or even more.
[00:47:42.460 --> 00:47:45.860]   They just have to remember that there's competition.
[00:47:45.860 --> 00:47:47.020]   You can go to Netflix.
[00:47:47.020 --> 00:47:48.020]   You can download it.
[00:47:48.020 --> 00:47:49.020]   Yeah, but if you watch the Netflix stuff.
[00:47:49.020 --> 00:47:50.020]   What do you mean?
[00:47:50.020 --> 00:47:52.140]   Oh, not on streaming.
[00:47:52.140 --> 00:47:53.140]   You can just get it as a TV.
[00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:54.140]   You're right.
[00:47:54.140 --> 00:47:55.820]   That's streaming stuff.
[00:47:55.820 --> 00:47:57.700]   You really, I take my glasses off to watch.
[00:47:57.700 --> 00:48:01.340]   So you're saying the Apple looks better than cinema now or Netflix?
[00:48:01.340 --> 00:48:02.340]   Oh, yeah.
[00:48:02.340 --> 00:48:03.340]   Yeah.
[00:48:03.340 --> 00:48:06.340]   Regarding the 24-hour thing, I think everybody's missing something.
[00:48:06.340 --> 00:48:11.380]   I've heard from more than one person that at least half of the cause of that, if not
[00:48:11.380 --> 00:48:13.620]   all of the cause of that, the studios may not be Apple.
[00:48:13.620 --> 00:48:14.620]   I'm sure it is.
[00:48:14.620 --> 00:48:15.620]   Yeah.
[00:48:15.620 --> 00:48:16.620]   Yeah.
[00:48:16.620 --> 00:48:18.660]   I have a feeling that some in negotiations they were getting close to what they wanted
[00:48:18.660 --> 00:48:22.260]   and somebody really had to pee or get a cigarette and they just left that off.
[00:48:22.260 --> 00:48:23.500]   Well, no, I should point out this.
[00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:27.380]   This is pretty much the same terms that Xbox Live rents movies on.
[00:48:27.380 --> 00:48:28.380]   How does that?
[00:48:28.380 --> 00:48:30.300]   Is that exactly the same except it costs more?
[00:48:30.300 --> 00:48:32.140]   Well, I don't think it's doing well for Microsoft.
[00:48:32.140 --> 00:48:33.140]   I don't know.
[00:48:33.140 --> 00:48:34.980]   I have a red ring of death now, my Xbox Live.
[00:48:34.980 --> 00:48:35.980]   But here's the thing.
[00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:36.980]   I saw that.
[00:48:36.980 --> 00:48:37.980]   That's awful.
[00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:39.780]   All I'm trying to say is that, okay, if you're going to go, and this is why everybody keeps
[00:48:39.780 --> 00:48:42.540]   failing so miserably with the TV piece of this.
[00:48:42.540 --> 00:48:46.420]   And what's that new music download service that doesn't work on iPods, whatever it's
[00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:48.060]   called, clicks or quicks or whatever?
[00:48:48.060 --> 00:48:49.340]   Oh, the new peer to peer.
[00:48:49.340 --> 00:48:50.860]   I don't understand that.
[00:48:50.860 --> 00:48:51.860]   They say it's legal.
[00:48:51.860 --> 00:48:53.460]   Don't even get me started.
[00:48:53.460 --> 00:48:59.980]   So it's almost like some douchey label guy started an article in an in-flight magazine
[00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:01.940]   about the internet and never finished it.
[00:49:01.940 --> 00:49:05.980]   And so they get this idea that, hey, cheap distribution, this is great.
[00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:09.980]   What they're not getting is that there's this huge piece about the way people's the
[00:49:09.980 --> 00:49:14.740]   past that people have trodden since 1998, that they're very comfortable walking.
[00:49:14.740 --> 00:49:18.180]   And the Alex is in the Merlins and presumably the Andes of the World.
[00:49:18.180 --> 00:49:22.020]   I mean, we have a certain way we like to do this stuff that you can completely capitalize
[00:49:22.020 --> 00:49:23.020]   on.
[00:49:23.020 --> 00:49:25.180]   I think it's totally not Apple's decision.
[00:49:25.180 --> 00:49:29.900]   But I think that you're going to continue to see these stupid online half measures fail
[00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:33.820]   until they understand the fundamental way that people use these kinds of lives.
[00:49:33.820 --> 00:49:37.660]   All it takes is one time like several years, I got the lives of others and then I got sick
[00:49:37.660 --> 00:49:40.540]   and I went to sleep and my wife watched it and then I woke up the next day and it was
[00:49:40.540 --> 00:49:41.540]   gone.
[00:49:41.540 --> 00:49:43.100]   And I was like, okay, I'm back to Netflix.
[00:49:43.100 --> 00:49:44.100]   Right.
[00:49:44.100 --> 00:49:46.100]   You know, it only takes one time where it's just like a little...
[00:49:46.100 --> 00:49:47.300]   Apple knows that by the way.
[00:49:47.300 --> 00:49:49.620]   It probably gripes them that they don't have a choice.
[00:49:49.620 --> 00:49:54.260]   Well, I'm not sure that I agree that it's that big of a deal breaker for so many people.
[00:49:54.260 --> 00:49:58.020]   The big bummer for me was that, of course, I had to write a column for the paper that
[00:49:58.020 --> 00:49:59.020]   night.
[00:49:59.020 --> 00:50:01.940]   So, of course, I rented a gratitude and it sat down to click and see what the video quality
[00:50:01.940 --> 00:50:04.660]   was like and realize that, oh, wait a minute, that means I won't be able to watch it.
[00:50:04.660 --> 00:50:05.660]   Now much.
[00:50:05.660 --> 00:50:06.660]   Yeah.
[00:50:06.660 --> 00:50:11.380]   But I think that it's a big win for a lot of people just from the virtue of, again, being
[00:50:11.380 --> 00:50:17.220]   in that hotel room and trying to find something to fill your six hour flight home with, that's
[00:50:17.220 --> 00:50:18.220]   certainly perfectly useful.
[00:50:18.220 --> 00:50:23.940]   When you have that Apple TV upgrade and, again, you have the ability to simply say, oh, yeah,
[00:50:23.940 --> 00:50:26.220]   the illusionist, I keep missing that one on cable.
[00:50:26.220 --> 00:50:28.620]   And for four bucks, I can see it right now.
[00:50:28.620 --> 00:50:29.620]   That's also...
[00:50:29.620 --> 00:50:32.140]   It's not a deal breaker that is 24 hours.
[00:50:32.140 --> 00:50:34.500]   I do think that they're going to have to extend that.
[00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:38.060]   I'm sure that we're going to see a...
[00:50:38.060 --> 00:50:41.980]   What was the word for the Steve Jobs version of apologetic when there's like...
[00:50:41.980 --> 00:50:42.980]   There's always that little...
[00:50:42.980 --> 00:50:43.980]   You want to announce the new Apple TV.
[00:50:43.980 --> 00:50:44.980]   It's not a...
[00:50:44.980 --> 00:50:48.180]   There's that little smirk that's like, okay, you guys aren't ready to go.
[00:50:48.180 --> 00:50:49.180]   You get this yet, so...
[00:50:49.180 --> 00:50:50.180]   I'm way ahead of you.
[00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:52.180]   So we'll change things.
[00:50:52.180 --> 00:50:57.020]   I'm sure that we'll see the sort of half smirk and say, well, of course, we've decided
[00:50:57.020 --> 00:51:01.180]   to change because people weren't understanding what we were going after with this 24 hours.
[00:51:01.180 --> 00:51:02.180]   It's a feature, folks.
[00:51:02.180 --> 00:51:03.180]   I don't think...
[00:51:03.180 --> 00:51:04.180]   We feel that we understand that.
[00:51:04.180 --> 00:51:05.580]   I don't think you and Merlin are incompatible.
[00:51:05.580 --> 00:51:09.380]   I think what it comes down to is how you watch movies.
[00:51:09.380 --> 00:51:12.300]   And I think Alex does it one way.
[00:51:12.300 --> 00:51:13.380]   And you do it another way.
[00:51:13.380 --> 00:51:18.540]   I mean, the question is how the vast majority of iTunes users do it.
[00:51:18.540 --> 00:51:21.140]   I do admit that I'm the sort of guy who...
[00:51:21.140 --> 00:51:24.860]   I will block out that two hours and ten minutes to see the entire movie from start to finish
[00:51:24.860 --> 00:51:26.780]   so I can really enjoy it and really focus on it.
[00:51:26.780 --> 00:51:29.780]   I think there's a perception that if it's on my hard drive...
[00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:33.220]   I think there's a perception that if it's on my hard drive, I should get to watch it in
[00:51:33.220 --> 00:51:36.180]   chunks over a longer period than 24 hours.
[00:51:36.180 --> 00:51:37.820]   Oh, but, Rem, you don't know that, sir.
[00:51:37.820 --> 00:51:38.820]   You're...
[00:51:38.820 --> 00:51:43.340]   I understand, but the thing that's changed is unlike streaming, it's on my drive now.
[00:51:43.340 --> 00:51:47.100]   It's on your drive so you can move it from device to device, not so that you can do whatever
[00:51:47.100 --> 00:51:48.100]   you want.
[00:51:48.100 --> 00:51:52.020]   You can say that, but I think that psychologically people go, "I own it."
[00:51:52.020 --> 00:51:55.540]   I may only own it for 24 hours, but I own it.
[00:51:55.540 --> 00:51:57.860]   And you're competing against stuff that doesn't do that.
[00:51:57.860 --> 00:51:58.860]   Netflix doesn't...
[00:51:58.860 --> 00:52:02.020]   That was the secret to Netflix was you can keep it as long as you want.
[00:52:02.020 --> 00:52:05.820]   Yeah, but it's really hard to fold up that DVD and stick inside your iPod.
[00:52:05.820 --> 00:52:08.060]   You have to cut a slot in the slide-by iPod.
[00:52:08.060 --> 00:52:09.900]   Get those chunks of the DVD inside there.
[00:52:09.900 --> 00:52:14.340]   You guys are missing a big income opportunity here, which is to just simply sell six copies
[00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:15.340]   to people.
[00:52:15.340 --> 00:52:18.900]   So when you go in and you want to watch the lives of others, you just rent six copies.
[00:52:18.900 --> 00:52:22.500]   And then you can pause it up to, I guess, five or six times.
[00:52:22.500 --> 00:52:23.980]   Or like do what Fox does, right?
[00:52:23.980 --> 00:52:27.620]   When you buy the DVD now, that was pretty cool that they put a...
[00:52:27.620 --> 00:52:29.620]   You know, go off the title and you can't.
[00:52:29.620 --> 00:52:30.620]   I don't know if you buy six.
[00:52:30.620 --> 00:52:32.620]   You're renting six copies of it?
[00:52:32.620 --> 00:52:33.620]   So six times four dollars.
[00:52:33.620 --> 00:52:34.620]   I'm seeing very poorly on that.
[00:52:34.620 --> 00:52:35.620]   It's just his idea.
[00:52:35.620 --> 00:52:36.620]   I'm sorry.
[00:52:36.620 --> 00:52:37.620]   But actually, you do...
[00:52:37.620 --> 00:52:38.620]   You do...
[00:52:38.620 --> 00:52:39.620]   You do...
[00:52:39.620 --> 00:52:41.020]   You do it the next year day for a dollar.
[00:52:41.020 --> 00:52:42.580]   I would do it.
[00:52:42.580 --> 00:52:45.100]   That's more like the movie store model.
[00:52:45.100 --> 00:52:46.100]   I mean, that's what the...
[00:52:46.100 --> 00:52:49.460]   I had every intention of seeing this all in one day.
[00:52:49.460 --> 00:52:50.460]   I missed it.
[00:52:50.460 --> 00:52:52.700]   But instead of just simply saying, "Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:52:52.700 --> 00:52:53.700]   This movie was expired."
[00:52:53.700 --> 00:52:57.060]   If there was a button saying, "For 99 cents, I'll give you an extra day."
[00:52:57.060 --> 00:52:58.060]   And you can only do this once.
[00:52:58.060 --> 00:53:01.420]   And you can choose what day within the 30 days you can do this.
[00:53:01.420 --> 00:53:02.580]   That would probably be a great feature.
[00:53:02.580 --> 00:53:04.420]   I don't think that's how people watch media anymore.
[00:53:04.420 --> 00:53:05.420]   I don't think...
[00:53:05.420 --> 00:53:06.980]   I think for me, as somebody...
[00:53:06.980 --> 00:53:08.900]   And I'm probably being a little bit Alex here.
[00:53:08.900 --> 00:53:13.020]   But the way that I do this, I've got a Tivo and I watch it whenever I want and I stop whenever
[00:53:13.020 --> 00:53:17.180]   I want and if my daughter cries, I don't sweat it because I'm a great dad and I don't
[00:53:17.180 --> 00:53:20.780]   mind pausing Project Runway to go take care of my daughter.
[00:53:20.780 --> 00:53:22.620]   We got Leo's wife on Skype.
[00:53:22.620 --> 00:53:23.620]   That's Merlin talking.
[00:53:23.620 --> 00:53:24.620]   That's Merlin talking.
[00:53:24.620 --> 00:53:26.620]   It's like a flunk of flunk of flunk.
[00:53:26.620 --> 00:53:27.620]   Don't look at me.
[00:53:27.620 --> 00:53:30.460]   We got more emails about Merlin's claim.
[00:53:30.460 --> 00:53:31.460]   We got Merlin's mom.
[00:53:31.460 --> 00:53:32.460]   We got Merlin's mom.
[00:53:32.460 --> 00:53:33.460]   Merlin's mother-in-law.
[00:53:33.460 --> 00:53:39.380]   I bought the Fox movie.
[00:53:39.380 --> 00:53:40.380]   How did that work?
[00:53:40.380 --> 00:53:41.380]   Oh good.
[00:53:41.380 --> 00:53:42.380]   I want to hear how that works.
[00:53:42.380 --> 00:53:46.700]   It was the family guy Star Wars take off, which by the way just had me spitting up on
[00:53:46.700 --> 00:53:47.700]   their clothes.
[00:53:47.700 --> 00:53:48.700]   Oh, it's so bad.
[00:53:48.700 --> 00:53:49.860]   You were spitting up.
[00:53:49.860 --> 00:53:52.100]   The file just was generating in gallons and gallons.
[00:53:52.100 --> 00:53:55.060]   There were two discs in there.
[00:53:55.060 --> 00:53:59.860]   One contained the digital media file that you could copy off onto your iPhone, which
[00:53:59.860 --> 00:54:00.860]   I did.
[00:54:00.860 --> 00:54:02.940]   And then one contained the one you can actually watch.
[00:54:02.940 --> 00:54:04.900]   And I think that's brilliant.
[00:54:04.900 --> 00:54:10.420]   For those who are older like me, who still enjoy occasionally touching a physical media.
[00:54:10.420 --> 00:54:12.700]   Left ish.
[00:54:12.700 --> 00:54:13.700]   It was kind of cool.
[00:54:13.700 --> 00:54:18.500]   And I think it's a nice transition until everybody gets trained to fully download everything.
[00:54:18.500 --> 00:54:21.740]   And I've been kind of quiet during this thing, but I want to just mention when I get my new
[00:54:21.740 --> 00:54:27.140]   Apple TV with the new stuff, I'll be one of those guys who like Andy suggest, I'll just
[00:54:27.140 --> 00:54:30.460]   say, "Hey, I got a couple of hours to kill and cruise through here and watch a movie.
[00:54:30.460 --> 00:54:32.740]   I won't care how long I have it."
[00:54:32.740 --> 00:54:36.340]   Tell us about the quality of the digital copy and is there DRM in it?
[00:54:36.340 --> 00:54:37.340]   That kind of thing.
[00:54:37.340 --> 00:54:40.300]   Yeah, I think we can move it out and play it.
[00:54:40.300 --> 00:54:45.340]   I was able to copy it onto two different devices, so I don't see any DRM and the quality was
[00:54:45.340 --> 00:54:46.340]   superb.
[00:54:46.340 --> 00:54:47.340]   I'm buying it.
[00:54:47.340 --> 00:54:50.140]   It was absolutely stunning and brilliant.
[00:54:50.140 --> 00:54:51.540]   Thank you, Fox.
[00:54:51.540 --> 00:54:52.940]   What's more than this?
[00:54:52.940 --> 00:54:55.380]   Is it M4P or...?
[00:54:55.380 --> 00:54:57.980]   It's formatted for...
[00:54:57.980 --> 00:55:01.220]   I think M4A, M4V, I mean, I don't know.
[00:55:01.220 --> 00:55:02.780]   M4V, it would be.
[00:55:02.780 --> 00:55:04.580]   It's probably H.264, I would guess.
[00:55:04.580 --> 00:55:05.580]   It'll probably be MKV.
[00:55:05.580 --> 00:55:07.940]   They're probably going to really push the envelope on this one.
[00:55:07.940 --> 00:55:09.220]   All I know is it worked.
[00:55:09.220 --> 00:55:11.220]   I put it on my iPhone and it worked.
[00:55:11.220 --> 00:55:12.580]   And it looks really good.
[00:55:12.580 --> 00:55:13.900]   I mean, really, really good.
[00:55:13.900 --> 00:55:14.900]   I was surprised.
[00:55:14.900 --> 00:55:16.740]   I was thinking to myself, "Okay, here's the deal.
[00:55:16.740 --> 00:55:19.020]   They're going to dumb it down and make it so low-res."
[00:55:19.020 --> 00:55:20.020]   Right.
[00:55:20.020 --> 00:55:21.020]   "Enjoy it."
[00:55:21.020 --> 00:55:22.020]   Right.
[00:55:22.020 --> 00:55:23.020]   That wasn't the case.
[00:55:23.020 --> 00:55:27.060]   And it was like, "I think this is a really good transitional move and it certainly will
[00:55:27.060 --> 00:55:31.580]   alleviate people's desire to do illegal copying."
[00:55:31.580 --> 00:55:32.580]   I agree.
[00:55:32.580 --> 00:55:33.580]   No, I think so.
[00:55:33.580 --> 00:55:37.860]   But it's interesting, if it's not copy protected, I wonder what their rational is.
[00:55:37.860 --> 00:55:40.580]   I mean, people could put this on the torrents.
[00:55:40.580 --> 00:55:43.940]   I would like to put higher quality ones on the torrents now.
[00:55:43.940 --> 00:55:44.940]   But it probably has your...
[00:55:44.940 --> 00:55:45.940]   It probably...
[00:55:45.940 --> 00:55:48.220]   Well, the thing is, if it came off a DVD, it wouldn't have any correct.
[00:55:48.220 --> 00:55:49.220]   No, you're right.
[00:55:49.220 --> 00:55:50.220]   Interesting.
[00:55:50.220 --> 00:55:53.900]   Do you think this might be a trial balloon to see, "Well, let's put this out and let's
[00:55:53.900 --> 00:55:57.100]   take a look on the torrents to see how often this shows up."
[00:55:57.100 --> 00:56:00.220]   And if it turns out that, "Well, look, they're already putting other versions of this on
[00:56:00.220 --> 00:56:01.220]   there."
[00:56:01.220 --> 00:56:02.220]   Better quality.
[00:56:02.220 --> 00:56:03.220]   Right.
[00:56:03.220 --> 00:56:04.220]   And it's not...
[00:56:04.220 --> 00:56:05.220]   It's there, but it's not really killing us.
[00:56:05.220 --> 00:56:07.380]   So why don't we think about...
[00:56:07.380 --> 00:56:10.860]   This is a metric we can use when we're trying to figure out if we want to put this on every
[00:56:10.860 --> 00:56:13.260]   single DVD we do, or at least the high-profile ones.
[00:56:13.260 --> 00:56:14.260]   Well, the DVD...
[00:56:14.260 --> 00:56:17.340]   Do you guys remember back in the day when people used to photocopy books instead of
[00:56:17.340 --> 00:56:18.340]   buy them?
[00:56:18.340 --> 00:56:19.980]   Anybody else have to remember that?
[00:56:19.980 --> 00:56:24.740]   I remember that probably anybody, including me, who worked in the library in 1986 would
[00:56:24.740 --> 00:56:26.940]   probably be arrested today for what we did.
[00:56:26.940 --> 00:56:29.500]   All the reserve reading that we would have to copy it.
[00:56:29.500 --> 00:56:30.500]   I'm sure that's totally...
[00:56:30.500 --> 00:56:31.660]   Did it copy the whole book?
[00:56:31.660 --> 00:56:33.540]   You can't do that all the time.
[00:56:33.540 --> 00:56:34.540]   So here's the thing.
[00:56:34.540 --> 00:56:39.540]   When that stopped was when the price of paperbacks came down to match what it would cost to
[00:56:39.540 --> 00:56:40.540]   copy it.
[00:56:40.540 --> 00:56:41.540]   Right.
[00:56:41.540 --> 00:56:42.540]   And that's essentially what's going on with DVD copy.
[00:56:42.540 --> 00:56:43.540]   Do that back in your day.
[00:56:43.540 --> 00:56:47.340]   I guess probably back then it would have been probably it would be offset pressing to...
[00:56:47.340 --> 00:56:49.940]   Yeah, we had a Gutenberg press.
[00:56:49.940 --> 00:56:53.580]   And all we had was the one Gutenberg Bible and you had to put on gloves.
[00:56:53.580 --> 00:56:58.260]   And if the guild was striking for better me, then there was a whole month for you.
[00:56:58.260 --> 00:57:01.900]   And I used California Job case, Merlin.
[00:57:01.900 --> 00:57:06.580]   MacBook Air, according to some rumor sources, is going to be in stores on Wednesday, maybe
[00:57:06.580 --> 00:57:10.780]   even today.
[00:57:10.780 --> 00:57:12.380]   So you'll be able to buy them.
[00:57:12.380 --> 00:57:15.580]   I know that Jason Stell and Mac World got his...
[00:57:15.580 --> 00:57:19.660]   Well, he got a review unit last week, so they're clearly coming out.
[00:57:19.660 --> 00:57:23.420]   In fact, some say they're already in stores and the Genius, according to Mac News Network,
[00:57:23.420 --> 00:57:26.620]   the Genius Bar employees should be getting training today.
[00:57:26.620 --> 00:57:28.580]   Have you looked at the benchmarks?
[00:57:28.580 --> 00:57:29.660]   Yeah, very slow.
[00:57:29.660 --> 00:57:30.780]   So slowest Intel...
[00:57:30.780 --> 00:57:33.620]   Slowest Intel Mac.
[00:57:33.620 --> 00:57:34.620]   Sweet.
[00:57:34.620 --> 00:57:35.620]   I bought a Mac book.
[00:57:35.620 --> 00:57:44.300]   Just after this came out, I thought, "Okay, now I'm going to buy the Mac book.
[00:57:44.300 --> 00:57:51.180]   1,800 bucks faster, has a DVD, super-driving it, four gigs of RAM, removable battery, so
[00:57:51.180 --> 00:57:52.820]   I have two batteries, so I can make..."
[00:57:52.820 --> 00:57:55.020]   Yeah, okay, so I don't get five hours.
[00:57:55.020 --> 00:57:58.860]   Although Jason's saying his is getting about three hours, which is about what my MacBook
[00:57:58.860 --> 00:57:59.860]   gets.
[00:57:59.860 --> 00:58:00.860]   You know what we need to do, Leo?
[00:58:00.860 --> 00:58:07.300]   One of the wonderful things about being associated with you in your lovely program is that your
[00:58:07.300 --> 00:58:11.020]   obsessions, ones of sessions, become very broadly cast.
[00:58:11.020 --> 00:58:15.740]   And so at this point, I am happy to say that I have people contacting me to ask me if...
[00:58:15.740 --> 00:58:16.740]   With 12 inches.
[00:58:16.740 --> 00:58:17.740]   Yes.
[00:58:17.740 --> 00:58:18.740]   And so I'm thinking we should start a clearing house.
[00:58:18.740 --> 00:58:23.180]   Maybe we should do our own little mini eBay, where people who want to buy and sell 12-inch
[00:58:23.180 --> 00:58:25.420]   power books can all gather in one place.
[00:58:25.420 --> 00:58:27.980]   We just call it Merlin's 12-inch.
[00:58:27.980 --> 00:58:30.180]   And it would be...
[00:58:30.180 --> 00:58:32.300]   You can just make a little sight.
[00:58:32.300 --> 00:58:35.580]   Well, you're giving me a lot of credit.
[00:58:35.580 --> 00:58:40.620]   Well, once again, that's the thing for bottles, starring Mrs. Merlin.
[00:58:40.620 --> 00:58:48.220]   First of all, he's not as good a dad as you say, and 12 inches.
[00:58:48.220 --> 00:58:49.220]   Anyway...
[00:58:49.220 --> 00:58:50.220]   Yeah, sorry, man.
[00:58:50.220 --> 00:58:51.220]   No, here's the thing.
[00:58:51.220 --> 00:58:54.340]   Seriously, I mean, I'm out there like fielding offers now for people where I'm able to go,
[00:58:54.340 --> 00:58:55.340]   "Well, you know..."
[00:58:55.340 --> 00:58:56.340]   So would you buy one, though?
[00:58:56.340 --> 00:58:58.060]   I mean, it's a G4 in there.
[00:58:58.060 --> 00:58:59.060]   Would you buy that?
[00:58:59.060 --> 00:59:00.060]   Oh, of God, yes.
[00:59:00.060 --> 00:59:01.060]   No, question.
[00:59:01.060 --> 00:59:02.060]   What's...
[00:59:02.060 --> 00:59:03.740]   Okay, so here's the deal.
[00:59:03.740 --> 00:59:06.740]   I sit around, I drink coffee, and I type on the internet.
[00:59:06.740 --> 00:59:08.220]   What's slowing me down about a 12-inch?
[00:59:08.220 --> 00:59:09.220]   Right.
[00:59:09.220 --> 00:59:10.220]   That I can take fricking everywhere.
[00:59:10.220 --> 00:59:12.100]   What is one of those worth really, Merlin?
[00:59:12.100 --> 00:59:13.100]   I mean, what's the cash?
[00:59:13.100 --> 00:59:17.420]   One that I bought a year ago was 500.
[00:59:17.420 --> 00:59:19.740]   That was a screaming deal from a very nice friend.
[00:59:19.740 --> 00:59:21.100]   But I think that's about right.
[00:59:21.100 --> 00:59:25.340]   Well, I think now, like, I would think somewhere in the $500, $600 I'm guessing.
[00:59:25.340 --> 00:59:26.340]   Yeah.
[00:59:26.340 --> 00:59:27.940]   Okay, so, you know, send them on.
[00:59:27.940 --> 00:59:30.260]   I'll take them for $250.
[00:59:30.260 --> 00:59:32.540]   And we'll re-resell retail at the bottom.
[00:59:32.540 --> 00:59:33.540]   What are you gonna do?
[00:59:33.540 --> 00:59:34.540]   You're gonna build a fort out of them?
[00:59:34.540 --> 00:59:35.540]   Like, what's your plan?
[00:59:35.540 --> 00:59:38.380]   I'm gonna build an empire on based on your own.
[00:59:38.380 --> 00:59:42.980]   Looking on eBay, buy it now for a 12-inch, is $395.
[00:59:42.980 --> 00:59:51.580]   Current bid for a 12-inch with 768 megabytes of RAM is $340.
[00:59:51.580 --> 00:59:52.580]   They're on eBay.
[00:59:52.580 --> 00:59:53.580]   You could get them.
[00:59:53.580 --> 00:59:54.580]   Yeah.
[00:59:54.580 --> 00:59:57.820]   I still have to go back to the statement that I would much rather have a thinner notebook
[00:59:57.820 --> 01:00:01.340]   than a narrower notebook, because I just don't have any room in my...
[01:00:01.340 --> 01:00:05.820]   If I had a bag that was that thin, that was that narrow, or a space on my desk that was
[01:00:05.820 --> 01:00:09.340]   that narrow, then that extra space might be important to me.
[01:00:09.340 --> 01:00:12.660]   But the idea of having a notebook that will fit into any bag that I have, no matter what
[01:00:12.660 --> 01:00:15.100]   else I have in that bag, that's easier to carry.
[01:00:15.100 --> 01:00:16.100]   That's not gonna fly out of...
[01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:18.500]   I don't feel like it's gonna fly out of my hand when I carry it around.
[01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:22.500]   That thinness is a much bigger feature for me than the narrowness.
[01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:23.500]   So are you gonna do a...
[01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:24.500]   Get that in coach.
[01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:25.500]   You don't get that thing in...
[01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:28.260]   I swear to God, I don't have a computer that I can open in coach anymore.
[01:00:28.260 --> 01:00:29.260]   I have my ACs.
[01:00:29.260 --> 01:00:30.260]   The ACs is...
[01:00:30.260 --> 01:00:31.260]   I don't...
[01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:32.260]   I don't...
[01:00:32.260 --> 01:00:35.260]   If I have that 12-inch open in coach...
[01:00:35.260 --> 01:00:36.260]   It's still...
[01:00:36.260 --> 01:00:37.260]   What's...
[01:00:37.260 --> 01:00:38.260]   The punch is the screen.
[01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:41.460]   I'm still not low enough that I really can be comfortable with it.
[01:00:41.460 --> 01:00:44.180]   I still have to use that...
[01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:49.180]   My $10 flea market NEC folio computer that works great because it's just...
[01:00:49.180 --> 01:00:50.180]   It's tiny.
[01:00:50.180 --> 01:00:54.140]   For 50 or 60 bucks, we're something that will just word process and just do spread-cheating.
[01:00:54.140 --> 01:00:55.140]   That's perfectly fine for me.
[01:00:55.140 --> 01:00:57.500]   I think the ACs is a good choice too on that.
[01:00:57.500 --> 01:00:58.500]   I see...
[01:00:58.500 --> 01:00:59.500]   I see people...
[01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:00.500]   I see people...
[01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:01.500]   I have an ACs, yeah.
[01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:02.500]   I also have an ACs...
[01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:03.500]   I have an ACs...
[01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:04.500]   I'm in an OLPC.
[01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:08.220]   I've got an OLPC and I cannot make my OLPC do anything.
[01:01:08.220 --> 01:01:11.860]   It hates me and apparently I have fat fingers and it hates WPA.
[01:01:11.860 --> 01:01:12.860]   And so it's just...
[01:01:12.860 --> 01:01:16.340]   Well, because in Carlos, there's a reason why you're a moderately wealthy white man
[01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:17.780]   who lives in America.
[01:01:17.780 --> 01:01:18.780]   If you already know that...
[01:01:18.780 --> 01:01:21.420]   If you were in a row of no time...
[01:01:21.420 --> 01:01:23.260]   No actually, I've got WPA working Merlin.
[01:01:23.260 --> 01:01:26.260]   I'll send you this little terminal script you can get WPA to work with.
[01:01:26.260 --> 01:01:29.500]   Make sure that gets into the show notes by the way that Andy is the one who says people
[01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:32.220]   in third world countries don't deserve secure connections.
[01:01:32.220 --> 01:01:34.140]   No, WPA works with it.
[01:01:34.140 --> 01:01:36.140]   No, I've got it working with it.
[01:01:36.140 --> 01:01:37.140]   You have to...
[01:01:37.140 --> 01:01:39.140]   It's too bad we're not recording this, Merlin.
[01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:40.140]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:01:40.140 --> 01:01:41.140]   We are.
[01:01:41.140 --> 01:01:43.580]   We can rewind and find out there was actually Merlin who said that.
[01:01:43.580 --> 01:01:44.580]   Okay, okay, okay.
[01:01:44.580 --> 01:01:45.580]   I am as always...
[01:01:45.580 --> 01:01:46.580]   Yes.
[01:01:46.580 --> 01:01:47.580]   Yes.
[01:01:47.580 --> 01:01:48.580]   The ACs...
[01:01:48.580 --> 01:01:51.420]   We got it working with Skype with the camera.
[01:01:51.420 --> 01:01:52.420]   We've got...
[01:01:52.420 --> 01:01:53.420]   I love the ACs.
[01:01:53.420 --> 01:01:54.420]   We've got Windows running on it.
[01:01:54.420 --> 01:01:55.420]   It's Linux.
[01:01:55.420 --> 01:01:56.420]   It's Linux.
[01:01:56.420 --> 01:01:58.100]   Or you can run XP on it.
[01:01:58.100 --> 01:01:59.380]   Where we're running XP on it.
[01:01:59.380 --> 01:02:01.980]   Liana has got that thing dialed in like a race car.
[01:02:01.980 --> 01:02:03.580]   And it's a nice size.
[01:02:03.580 --> 01:02:06.100]   Andy, here's my question to you.
[01:02:06.100 --> 01:02:10.180]   So for a fellow like me, if I were going to consider shutting my pie hole about this
[01:02:10.180 --> 01:02:13.940]   whole 12 inch thing and just wanted like a machine that's kind of easy to deal with
[01:02:13.940 --> 01:02:18.820]   and small, would you go for the ACIS thing or would you go for an NEC folio type thing?
[01:02:18.820 --> 01:02:23.100]   Do you think the NEC folio is just way too specific for an internet?
[01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:26.660]   I absolutely have a good question because I actually have to qualify it.
[01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:28.140]   When I am in a...
[01:02:28.140 --> 01:02:31.380]   That sort of situation, all I need to do is write stuff.
[01:02:31.380 --> 01:02:33.380]   And all I need to do is edit like a word file.
[01:02:33.380 --> 01:02:34.380]   It's like full screen mode.
[01:02:34.380 --> 01:02:35.380]   You can't fool around.
[01:02:35.380 --> 01:02:36.660]   There's nothing that you can jerk around with.
[01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:37.660]   You're just going to type.
[01:02:37.660 --> 01:02:41.300]   All you got is a nice, comfortable, full-size notebook screen.
[01:02:41.300 --> 01:02:42.300]   Excuse me.
[01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:46.140]   It's full-size notebook keyboard and a half vertical-sized notebook screen.
[01:02:46.140 --> 01:02:47.580]   It's just for word processing.
[01:02:47.580 --> 01:02:51.300]   It's a lot more credible now that I have an iPhone that gives me a real web browser
[01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:52.300]   and real email.
[01:02:52.300 --> 01:02:56.220]   There have been plenty of times when I just not even bother taking my MacBook with me
[01:02:56.220 --> 01:02:59.660]   on a weekend because, gee, I can write, I can edit and I can keep in touch with my
[01:02:59.660 --> 01:03:02.180]   email so I don't really need this sort of thing.
[01:03:02.180 --> 01:03:04.820]   If I needed a real computer, it would definitely be the Asus.
[01:03:04.820 --> 01:03:05.820]   That's a wonderful, wonderful machine.
[01:03:05.820 --> 01:03:06.820]   What about you, Lee?
[01:03:06.820 --> 01:03:07.820]   Are you liking it?
[01:03:07.820 --> 01:03:10.220]   Yeah, the keyboard is a little bit small.
[01:03:10.220 --> 01:03:12.700]   So if you have trouble, it's bigger than the OLPC.
[01:03:12.700 --> 01:03:13.700]   It's not membrane.
[01:03:13.700 --> 01:03:14.620]   It's a real keyboard.
[01:03:14.620 --> 01:03:17.180]   But if you, you know, you should try typing on it.
[01:03:17.180 --> 01:03:19.100]   The screen is not as good as the OLPC.
[01:03:19.100 --> 01:03:21.140]   The OLPC has a remarkable screen.
[01:03:21.140 --> 01:03:23.500]   My problem is feedback with the keys on the OLPC.
[01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:24.660]   No, you get feedback.
[01:03:24.660 --> 01:03:26.380]   There's travel on these keys.
[01:03:26.380 --> 01:03:33.020]   However, the 7 1/2 inch screen on the Asus is only 800 pixels wide, which means a lot
[01:03:33.020 --> 01:03:35.220]   of websites are scrolled off to the right.
[01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:37.460]   It's smaller than an original Mac screen.
[01:03:37.460 --> 01:03:40.340]   Yeah, it should be 1024.
[01:03:40.340 --> 01:03:42.460]   That's the one thing I would say is a negative.
[01:03:42.460 --> 01:03:46.140]   On the other hand, there's so many good things about it and it's only $400.
[01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:48.620]   Yeah, that's insane pricing.
[01:03:48.620 --> 01:03:51.620]   So I think, you know, that's, it's a very attractive computer.
[01:03:51.620 --> 01:03:56.060]   I think I would wait, if I were you, Merlin, I would wait until they do a larger screen.
[01:03:56.060 --> 01:03:58.180]   There's no reason why they couldn't do a larger screen right now.
[01:03:58.180 --> 01:03:59.940]   There's a lot of room on that bezel.
[01:03:59.940 --> 01:04:02.580]   With the Linux, with the Linux, you can print and use the internet and everything, right?
[01:04:02.580 --> 01:04:03.580]   It all works.
[01:04:03.580 --> 01:04:07.420]   You can print, use the internet, WPA works, Google works.
[01:04:07.420 --> 01:04:09.140]   It's got, it's got Firefox.
[01:04:09.140 --> 01:04:11.180]   It's got Thunderbird.
[01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:16.620]   You can add, it has Skype, but as Scott, or as Leon had did, you can add Skype to beta,
[01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:17.620]   Linux beta.
[01:04:17.620 --> 01:04:22.140]   You can install that fairly easily and get the camera so it can get the camera Skype
[01:04:22.140 --> 01:04:23.140]   working.
[01:04:23.140 --> 01:04:25.860]   I think it's a very handy little machine.
[01:04:25.860 --> 01:04:28.860]   And as many have, you can always put XP on it.
[01:04:28.860 --> 01:04:30.860]   It's not a difficult thing to do.
[01:04:30.860 --> 01:04:35.660]   And she also put the little SD card in there so we're not accessing the hard drive.
[01:04:35.660 --> 01:04:39.660]   You want to do that with XP because you want to turn off the swap drive with XP.
[01:04:39.660 --> 01:04:44.340]   You want to add more RAM so that doesn't need the swap drive and for stuff that's written
[01:04:44.340 --> 01:04:45.740]   a lot, you want to use an SD card.
[01:04:45.740 --> 01:04:48.580]   So when that dies, you can put another one in.
[01:04:48.580 --> 01:04:52.220]   But I, that's, the Asus is an impressive machine for that price, I think.
[01:04:52.220 --> 01:04:55.180]   Alex, are you still using your 12 inch power book?
[01:04:55.180 --> 01:04:56.180]   No.
[01:04:56.180 --> 01:05:02.620]   I mean, I have a, I have a, I have a lot, old laptops laying around.
[01:05:02.620 --> 01:05:07.980]   I mean, because I buy, I pretty much just wait every other, pretty much every other laptop
[01:05:07.980 --> 01:05:09.540]   upgrade from Apple.
[01:05:09.540 --> 01:05:10.540]   I usually buy a new one.
[01:05:10.540 --> 01:05:13.780]   And then somebody else in the company ends up with the one that I beat up.
[01:05:13.780 --> 01:05:19.900]   And then the, and then I use the other ones for, you know, serving up, I had an old clamshell
[01:05:19.900 --> 01:05:22.260]   that I was using as a DJ thing for a long, long time.
[01:05:22.260 --> 01:05:23.260]   That's when I saw it.
[01:05:23.260 --> 01:05:24.260]   I knew I saw it.
[01:05:24.260 --> 01:05:25.260]   That one, not a clamshell.
[01:05:25.260 --> 01:05:27.260]   It's like the old black Pismo or whatever.
[01:05:27.260 --> 01:05:28.260]   I mean, I love that.
[01:05:28.260 --> 01:05:30.700]   I knew I saw some sort of decrepit laptop.
[01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:31.860]   I have my Pismo still.
[01:05:31.860 --> 01:05:32.860]   I love that laptop.
[01:05:32.860 --> 01:05:35.740]   And that's really, so I have that.
[01:05:35.740 --> 01:05:39.580]   And, but I haven't, you know, I ordered one of the OOPCs I haven't gotten yet.
[01:05:39.580 --> 01:05:42.140]   I keep on getting emails from them saying there's a real delay on them.
[01:05:42.140 --> 01:05:43.140]   Yeah.
[01:05:43.140 --> 01:05:44.140]   Unfortunately.
[01:05:44.140 --> 01:05:45.140]   Yeah.
[01:05:45.140 --> 01:05:46.140]   And so I'm going to play with that one.
[01:05:46.140 --> 01:05:48.700]   I'm really looking at the Asus as another like thing to play with.
[01:05:48.700 --> 01:05:50.980]   We should point out that you can't get the OPC anymore.
[01:05:50.980 --> 01:05:54.220]   That was the give one, get one deal, which ended on December 31st.
[01:05:54.220 --> 01:05:59.700]   Can I ask you, ask you guys a question about the OPC because I went to that website and
[01:05:59.700 --> 01:06:04.220]   I had my fingers not hovering over the buy button, but at least I was thinking about it.
[01:06:04.220 --> 01:06:05.660]   And I decided not to.
[01:06:05.660 --> 01:06:07.500]   What made you buy the OPC?
[01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:12.060]   Was it altruism or was it curiosity or are you actually think you're going to be using
[01:06:12.060 --> 01:06:13.380]   this for something useful?
[01:06:13.380 --> 01:06:15.620]   For me, for me, I work in Africa.
[01:06:15.620 --> 01:06:19.660]   So so I just need to know what their, what their, yeah, it was, it was as much altruism
[01:06:19.660 --> 01:06:22.780]   and curiosity and, and you know, my press hat on as anything else.
[01:06:22.780 --> 01:06:26.220]   In fact, it isn't really something that you would probably use.
[01:06:26.220 --> 01:06:28.140]   It's really designed as an educational computer.
[01:06:28.140 --> 01:06:30.420]   It's not, it has a browser, but it's not about that.
[01:06:30.420 --> 01:06:35.820]   It's really about using Python, using Squeak, using, you know, the turtle graphics, using
[01:06:35.820 --> 01:06:36.820]   the music.
[01:06:36.820 --> 01:06:40.860]   It's got Tam Tam, which is kind of a poor man's garage band, not as good as garage band.
[01:06:40.860 --> 01:06:45.860]   You know, I was interested in the technology and I thought, Hey, here I can, I can also
[01:06:45.860 --> 01:06:46.860]   donate.
[01:06:46.860 --> 01:06:47.740]   I can, you know, give a little to charity.
[01:06:47.740 --> 01:06:49.900]   So I would use the Aces.
[01:06:49.900 --> 01:06:53.220]   I mean, if you had a choice, first of all, the Aces is a little less and you can still
[01:06:53.220 --> 01:06:54.220]   buy it.
[01:06:54.220 --> 01:06:57.260]   I mean, it's, it's interesting, the sort of penetration that the old PC is having.
[01:06:57.260 --> 01:07:01.300]   I was having dinner with a friend of mine in Coolidge Corner and Coolidge Corner is a
[01:07:01.300 --> 01:07:04.340]   very, uh, Andy and not go type.
[01:07:04.340 --> 01:07:08.700]   If you, if you, if you live the sort of life that I live, then you probably also like Coolidge,
[01:07:08.700 --> 01:07:09.700]   the Coolidge Corner area.
[01:07:09.700 --> 01:07:13.180]   I'm just walking down the street with a friend and somebody that I kind of met three years
[01:07:13.180 --> 01:07:16.340]   ago chased me down and say, Hey, I got the old PC at Pete's coffee.
[01:07:16.340 --> 01:07:19.620]   If you want to get a demo of it, I just, what, what, what, you're working?
[01:07:19.620 --> 01:07:20.460]   No, no, I just bought it.
[01:07:20.460 --> 01:07:24.060]   So I could show people that like you, you bought, you spent $400 just so that you can
[01:07:24.060 --> 01:07:27.140]   it does attract attention with those bright green ears.
[01:07:27.140 --> 01:07:28.060]   I mean, you can't miss it.
[01:07:28.060 --> 01:07:29.060]   Yeah.
[01:07:29.060 --> 01:07:31.300]   There was one in the speaker room at the, a little bit surprise that.
[01:07:31.300 --> 01:07:34.140]   Yeah, it was a little bit surprised that I didn't happen to see one in the keynote at
[01:07:34.140 --> 01:07:35.140]   a Mac world.
[01:07:35.140 --> 01:07:39.420]   Cause I was sure that somebody at least as, at least to, to have that wonderful attention
[01:07:39.420 --> 01:07:40.420]   getting, oh yeah.
[01:07:40.420 --> 01:07:41.420]   I have an old PC.
[01:07:41.420 --> 01:07:42.420]   It's really great.
[01:07:42.420 --> 01:07:43.420]   Handy little computer.
[01:07:43.420 --> 01:07:44.420]   I use it a lot.
[01:07:44.420 --> 01:07:45.580]   Well, and I think long term it will because they're not selling it anymore.
[01:07:45.580 --> 01:07:49.340]   I mean, I think that they're, if you're looking for now, MacBook Air, I think would
[01:07:49.340 --> 01:07:50.340]   attract attention.
[01:07:50.340 --> 01:07:51.940]   Are you going to get one to review, Andy?
[01:07:51.940 --> 01:07:52.940]   Yes.
[01:07:52.940 --> 01:07:57.660]   I'm probably going to get one at the end of this week or the beginning of next week.
[01:07:57.660 --> 01:08:01.260]   So I'll believe, believe, I already have lots of plans for that thing.
[01:08:01.260 --> 01:08:03.900]   Cause I don't know whether I'll have it for two weeks or two months.
[01:08:03.900 --> 01:08:08.100]   So we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll get some fingerprints on it before, before the shrink
[01:08:08.100 --> 01:08:09.580]   wrap is off of it.
[01:08:09.580 --> 01:08:13.660]   I, you know, I'm just worried about its durability more than anything else.
[01:08:13.660 --> 01:08:17.940]   You know, I don't know about that cause when I was playing with it in the, in my briefing,
[01:08:17.940 --> 01:08:22.700]   it, I know it's not built this way, but it feels like a block of, it was like milled
[01:08:22.700 --> 01:08:23.700]   out of a block of solid.
[01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:24.700]   It's pretty solid.
[01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:28.300]   It just feels very, as my fact, I was telling, I was asking them about it and they said that
[01:08:28.300 --> 01:08:31.660]   the, probably the funniest exchange for the entire briefing, I'm asking, well, is there
[01:08:31.660 --> 01:08:34.100]   like a, is there like magnesium frame inside this?
[01:08:34.100 --> 01:08:35.340]   What's supporting it?
[01:08:35.340 --> 01:08:38.940]   And he's, oh, no, no, it's, it's really does not, the, the, the, the casing is actually
[01:08:38.940 --> 01:08:41.660]   structural on top of whatever else we have inside there.
[01:08:41.660 --> 01:08:44.820]   And then he mentioned a certain model of sub notebook.
[01:08:44.820 --> 01:08:46.300]   Oh, cause you hold one of those things.
[01:08:46.300 --> 01:08:47.300]   You can twist the screen.
[01:08:47.300 --> 01:08:48.300]   It racks really, really easily.
[01:08:48.300 --> 01:08:52.220]   And at that point, I sort of moved my hands in a significant way and said, don't rack
[01:08:52.220 --> 01:08:53.220]   the screen.
[01:08:53.220 --> 01:08:55.220]   So apparently it is racable.
[01:08:55.220 --> 01:08:59.180]   Oh, no, no, I'm so, I'm saying, you know, he's got more briefings after that.
[01:08:59.180 --> 01:09:01.780]   Plus he knows, he knows it's not my notebook.
[01:09:01.780 --> 01:09:03.660]   So I don't care what happens to it.
[01:09:03.660 --> 01:09:04.660]   Right.
[01:09:04.660 --> 01:09:06.380]   Here's what I expect is going to happen.
[01:09:06.380 --> 01:09:09.700]   Someone's going to break it because they're going to try to do some stupid, like stick
[01:09:09.700 --> 01:09:11.620]   it down the back of their pants and sit on it.
[01:09:11.620 --> 01:09:13.900]   I mean, this, we get email about iPhone.
[01:09:13.900 --> 01:09:15.700]   They, I sat on my iPhone and broke it.
[01:09:15.700 --> 01:09:17.100]   It's a piece of crap.
[01:09:17.100 --> 01:09:18.300]   That is one epic ass.
[01:09:18.300 --> 01:09:22.180]   If you're still reading it down the back of your pants, even I can't claim that.
[01:09:22.180 --> 01:09:24.420]   Hey, I got a question for iPhone guys.
[01:09:24.420 --> 01:09:25.420]   Go ahead, Scott.
[01:09:25.420 --> 01:09:26.420]   And then I'll ask a question.
[01:09:26.420 --> 01:09:27.420]   People will be that stupid.
[01:09:27.420 --> 01:09:28.420]   Trust me.
[01:09:28.420 --> 01:09:29.420]   Oh, yeah.
[01:09:29.420 --> 01:09:33.740]   I don't know if this is something with one, one, three or if maybe, I don't know, maybe
[01:09:33.740 --> 01:09:35.220]   my iPhone's possessed.
[01:09:35.220 --> 01:09:37.780]   I put it, I keep an airport in port mode most of the time.
[01:09:37.780 --> 01:09:40.780]   And I don't know if it's going to be a good thing.
[01:09:40.780 --> 01:09:42.780]   I don't know if it's going to be a good thing.
[01:09:42.780 --> 01:09:45.780]   I don't know if it's going to be a good thing.
[01:09:45.780 --> 01:09:47.780]   I don't know if it's going to be a good thing.
[01:09:47.780 --> 01:09:49.780]   I don't know if it's going to be a good thing.
[01:09:49.780 --> 01:09:51.780]   I don't know if it's going to be a good thing.
[01:09:51.780 --> 01:09:53.780]   I don't know if it's going to be a good thing.
[01:09:53.780 --> 01:09:55.780]   I don't know if it's going to be a good thing.
[01:09:55.780 --> 01:09:56.780]   I don't know if it's going to be a good thing.
[01:09:56.780 --> 01:09:57.780]   I don't know if it's going to be a good thing.
[01:09:57.780 --> 01:09:58.780]   I don't know if it's going to be a good thing.
[01:09:58.780 --> 01:09:59.780]   I don't know if it's going to be a good thing.
[01:09:59.780 --> 01:10:00.780]   I don't know if it's going to be a good thing.
[01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:07.780]   I would restore airplane issues.
[01:10:07.780 --> 01:10:10.780]   I did a restore actually very recently since the 113.
[01:10:10.780 --> 01:10:11.780]   The people have had some problems with 113.
[01:10:11.780 --> 01:10:12.780]   Yeah, but that's not one I've heard.
[01:10:12.780 --> 01:10:13.780]   Yeah.
[01:10:13.780 --> 01:10:14.780]   All right.
[01:10:14.780 --> 01:10:15.780]   Maybe it's just me.
[01:10:15.780 --> 01:10:16.780]   I've heard some SMS issues.
[01:10:16.780 --> 01:10:17.780]   Yes.
[01:10:17.780 --> 01:10:20.780]   Messages out of order apparently.
[01:10:20.780 --> 01:10:23.780]   Although none of our phones in our shop have experienced that.
[01:10:23.780 --> 01:10:24.780]   I've heard that.
[01:10:24.780 --> 01:10:27.780]   But a few inconsistent things here and there.
[01:10:27.780 --> 01:10:30.780]   But I have not heard about the airport mode thing.
[01:10:30.780 --> 01:10:34.780]   That would be pretty serious if that was a significant, you know, a fact and significant
[01:10:34.780 --> 01:10:35.780]   number of people.
[01:10:35.780 --> 01:10:37.780]   Imagine on an airplane if it's turning itself on.
[01:10:37.780 --> 01:10:38.780]   We're going to crash!
[01:10:38.780 --> 01:10:43.780]   Or we'd find out that it's all bunk that you really can use your cell phone and they're
[01:10:43.780 --> 01:10:45.780]   just not letting you because they want to sell you their airtime.
[01:10:45.780 --> 01:10:46.780]   Good point.
[01:10:46.780 --> 01:10:48.780]   Actually, I looked into this.
[01:10:48.780 --> 01:10:49.780]   I called the FAA.
[01:10:49.780 --> 01:10:50.780]   I called the FCC.
[01:10:50.780 --> 01:10:54.780]   I called like three, four different airlines because I was reviewing these really cool
[01:10:54.780 --> 01:11:00.780]   Bluetooth, Edomonic Bluetooth in the ear, wireless headphones.
[01:11:00.780 --> 01:11:05.380]   I'm like, "Two hours before deadline, I've just written an interesting review I thought
[01:11:05.380 --> 01:11:07.780]   because I thought it was a silly product but then I was wearing them around.
[01:11:07.780 --> 01:11:09.780]   I thought they're actually kind of interesting."
[01:11:09.780 --> 01:11:11.340]   And then I'm proofreading it.
[01:11:11.340 --> 01:11:13.780]   I'm looking at the paragraph saying, "Oh, it's even better like when you're moving through
[01:11:13.780 --> 01:11:17.780]   an airport because you have to keep taking your jacket and your bags off and on but it won't
[01:11:17.780 --> 01:11:18.780]   get tangled up."
[01:11:18.780 --> 01:11:19.780]   They realize, "Wait a minute.
[01:11:19.780 --> 01:11:24.700]   You're not supposed to have a wireless Bluetooth device in an airplane cabin, are you?"
[01:11:24.700 --> 01:11:28.460]   And then so how to cancel the column for an entire week while I shag, well, I shag down
[01:11:28.460 --> 01:11:30.060]   all these answers.
[01:11:30.060 --> 01:11:37.500]   It turns out that the FAA gives lots of discretion to the individual carriers.
[01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:41.780]   They're allowed to allow any wireless device inside the cabin that they believe will not
[01:11:41.780 --> 01:11:44.780]   interfere with avionics or communications.
[01:11:44.780 --> 01:11:51.900]   And talking to United American, USA, they actually are okay with Bluetooth.
[01:11:51.900 --> 01:11:55.580]   I described the actual device and the frequency that it goes on and they said that they wouldn't,
[01:11:55.580 --> 01:12:00.180]   although the people, the staff, in flight the cabin have the final word on everything,
[01:12:00.180 --> 01:12:03.460]   institutionally they do not have a problem with the use of Bluetooth inside the cabin.
[01:12:03.460 --> 01:12:04.460]   I never heard that.
[01:12:04.460 --> 01:12:09.100]   Yeah, the captain of the plane is God and the captain can decide whether or not he's
[01:12:09.100 --> 01:12:10.100]   going to allow anything.
[01:12:10.100 --> 01:12:12.900]   And there are some captains who say no notebooks.
[01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:13.900]   Right.
[01:12:13.900 --> 01:12:14.900]   They don't fly a lot.
[01:12:14.900 --> 01:12:18.460]   But of course, as we've all witnessed, if you have eight, nine, ten of those little
[01:12:18.460 --> 01:12:22.020]   gin and tonics inside you, then really you're allowed to override the captain.
[01:12:22.020 --> 01:12:24.580]   You're allowed to stand up and run up and down the aisle.
[01:12:24.580 --> 01:12:26.140]   It's a logical thing to do.
[01:12:26.140 --> 01:12:27.140]   You really should try it.
[01:12:27.140 --> 01:12:28.140]   It's part of your right.
[01:12:28.140 --> 01:12:29.140]   What, Merlin?
[01:12:29.140 --> 01:12:30.940]   Does he think he's better than you?
[01:12:30.940 --> 01:12:32.580]   Just because you got that little hat?
[01:12:32.580 --> 01:12:36.220]   Well, just you get your own little room in front that locks and all of a sudden you boss
[01:12:36.220 --> 01:12:37.220]   me.
[01:12:37.220 --> 01:12:38.220]   I was just used all these kinds of electronics.
[01:12:38.220 --> 01:12:39.780]   How come I can't use my phone?
[01:12:39.780 --> 01:12:41.380]   Yeah, plane seems to be up fine.
[01:12:41.380 --> 01:12:43.020]   I don't know, man.
[01:12:43.020 --> 01:12:46.340]   Apple has released a tech note on this SMS out of order thing.
[01:12:46.340 --> 01:12:49.900]   They say, and by the way, it seems to be happening mostly in England.
[01:12:49.900 --> 01:12:54.780]   They say it can happen if the phone has a different date and time than the carrier network
[01:12:54.780 --> 01:13:00.620]   time, which makes sense because then your carrier network would be in a different order
[01:13:00.620 --> 01:13:03.500]   and your messages would be, I don't know which ones they honor, but that makes sense
[01:13:03.500 --> 01:13:06.300]   it would be out of order that way.
[01:13:06.300 --> 01:13:13.260]   Let's get to our picks of the week unless anybody has any other pressing items.
[01:13:13.260 --> 01:13:14.260]   I'll tell you what before.
[01:13:14.260 --> 01:13:16.940]   I've got my suits of the dry cleaners, but they're pressing informing.
[01:13:16.940 --> 01:13:17.940]   Oh, that's good.
[01:13:17.940 --> 01:13:22.500]   Before we do that, let me mention audible.com because Audible has backed baby.
[01:13:22.500 --> 01:13:28.580]   They're back and still a sponsor of many of the shows on this week in tech network, including
[01:13:28.580 --> 01:13:29.780]   Mac break weekly.
[01:13:29.780 --> 01:13:36.900]   We have our very own Earl audible.com A U D I B L E dot com slash Mac break.
[01:13:36.900 --> 01:13:41.020]   And if you go there, you could sign up, you get a coupon for a free book.
[01:13:41.020 --> 01:13:42.020]   Lots of free books.
[01:13:42.020 --> 01:13:44.740]   I'm going to let Andy, if he has something he wants to talk about.
[01:13:44.740 --> 01:13:47.300]   Oh, I have a great one this week.
[01:13:47.300 --> 01:13:50.660]   Now we were talking earlier about overlapping demographics.
[01:13:50.660 --> 01:13:55.380]   I'm guessing that the sort of audience that listens to Mac break weekly and the sort of
[01:13:55.380 --> 01:13:59.460]   audience who are Monty Python fans, I'm guessing there's a certain amount of intersection in
[01:13:59.460 --> 01:14:01.580]   that Venn diagram.
[01:14:01.580 --> 01:14:03.580]   You guys know that there's not more than.
[01:14:03.580 --> 01:14:08.580]   There's is is there isn't there is it is of course it is.
[01:14:08.580 --> 01:14:11.860]   See folks, we've just reproduced a classic Monty Python bit.
[01:14:11.860 --> 01:14:12.860]   What is argument?
[01:14:12.860 --> 01:14:16.260]   Although we probably should have coordinated figure out which one of us was going to be
[01:14:16.260 --> 01:14:20.260]   John Klee's and which one was was going to be Michael Palin.
[01:14:20.260 --> 01:14:22.820]   That translates very nicely into my pick.
[01:14:22.820 --> 01:14:26.500]   Michael Palin is has been a lifelong blogger.
[01:14:26.500 --> 01:14:29.980]   He's been keeping a regular blog since 1969.
[01:14:29.980 --> 01:14:34.300]   Of course, because there was no personal computers or the internet, he was doing it in analog
[01:14:34.300 --> 01:14:39.100]   fashion by every, every night or every other night, keeping a journal of how his day went
[01:14:39.100 --> 01:14:41.100]   and from that be awesome.
[01:14:41.100 --> 01:14:42.100]   Yes.
[01:14:42.100 --> 01:14:45.020]   And so he's been doing it regularly to this very day.
[01:14:45.020 --> 01:14:51.500]   He started it just after he got married, had his first kid and decided that well, geez,
[01:14:51.500 --> 01:14:53.620]   a lot of really nice moments are kind of going by.
[01:14:53.620 --> 01:14:56.260]   So I really want to remember this sort of stuff.
[01:14:56.260 --> 01:15:02.460]   And of course, this is just before he started the project with Monty Python.
[01:15:02.460 --> 01:15:10.380]   And so last year, he decided to publish a 10 year swath of these journals in Hardback.
[01:15:10.380 --> 01:15:16.860]   So diaries 1969 to 1979, the Python years, it's his regular diary of everything that
[01:15:16.860 --> 01:15:19.460]   he was up to while he was working with Python.
[01:15:19.460 --> 01:15:21.580]   There's a lot of Python, obviously a lot of Python stuff.
[01:15:21.580 --> 01:15:24.140]   You get a lot of 20 Python fan.
[01:15:24.140 --> 01:15:30.780]   You get so much great baseball of how these people work together, both as creative people
[01:15:30.780 --> 01:15:35.860]   and as business people, the petty annoyances, the major annoyances, the things that Michael
[01:15:35.860 --> 01:15:38.900]   at least through Michael Palin's eyes that he respected about each one of them and the
[01:15:38.900 --> 01:15:41.660]   things that really, really frustrated them.
[01:15:41.660 --> 01:15:45.340]   And meanwhile, he was in the orbits of so many different interesting people hanging out
[01:15:45.340 --> 01:15:50.860]   with George Harrison, visiting his house, just on top of all that, just regular day to
[01:15:50.860 --> 01:15:56.060]   day life in a very nice house next to Hampstead Heath in North London.
[01:15:56.060 --> 01:15:58.100]   It's like I said, I have the hard cover.
[01:15:58.100 --> 01:16:00.060]   I'm just halfway through it right now.
[01:16:00.060 --> 01:16:03.940]   At this point, they're just coming up with the idea for life of Ryan.
[01:16:03.940 --> 01:16:10.620]   And it really is like reading somebody's blog because you can dip into it and dip out of
[01:16:10.620 --> 01:16:11.620]   it.
[01:16:11.620 --> 01:16:15.780]   And it sees such a compelling writer, even when he's tossing out these very, very simple
[01:16:15.780 --> 01:16:20.980]   three paragraph little things, that it's the classic, "Oh, I really should start working
[01:16:20.980 --> 01:16:23.740]   again, but I'll just read to the next page."
[01:16:23.740 --> 01:16:28.340]   Now the neat thing about the audiobook is it's actually him reading it.
[01:16:28.340 --> 01:16:29.340]   It is actually him reading it.
[01:16:29.340 --> 01:16:33.100]   The only downside is that it is a bridge, but that will just give you the impetus to
[01:16:33.100 --> 01:16:36.260]   spend 20 bucks on the actual hardcover.
[01:16:36.260 --> 01:16:37.940]   But it really is marvelous reading.
[01:16:37.940 --> 01:16:40.580]   If you're a Python fan, it is an absolute must buy.
[01:16:40.580 --> 01:16:44.300]   Even if you're not a Python fan, you will think that it's one of those, you'll sort
[01:16:44.300 --> 01:16:48.780]   of like be the neurological muscle memory, be hitting a bookmark link, then realize,
[01:16:48.780 --> 01:16:49.780]   "Oh, wait a minute.
[01:16:49.780 --> 01:16:50.780]   This is an audiobook.
[01:16:50.780 --> 01:16:51.780]   I can't bookmark this."
[01:16:51.780 --> 01:16:52.780]   Next page.
[01:16:52.780 --> 01:16:53.780]   Here, let's play a little bit.
[01:16:53.780 --> 01:16:54.780]   This is Michael Palin.
[01:16:54.780 --> 01:16:55.780]   "Fected by Picnic Madness.
[01:16:55.780 --> 01:16:58.900]   There was a hopping relay race and a lot of fighting.
[01:16:58.900 --> 01:17:05.020]   The generous doses of wine numbed any possible after effects of my gingivectomy."
[01:17:05.020 --> 01:17:07.420]   Thomas stood without holding on today.
[01:17:07.420 --> 01:17:13.940]   He must have been smoking a little bit, because he's a little huskier than I remember.
[01:17:13.940 --> 01:17:16.860]   He's in his 60s now.
[01:17:16.860 --> 01:17:19.100]   From the book, I know that he's quit smoking.
[01:17:19.100 --> 01:17:22.940]   At the point in which I'm reading it, he quit smoking a long, long time ago.
[01:17:22.940 --> 01:17:25.780]   He only smokes the occasional cigar.
[01:17:25.780 --> 01:17:28.140]   He got too really...
[01:17:28.140 --> 01:17:30.620]   The second record went double-triple platinum.
[01:17:30.620 --> 01:17:34.720]   The publisher of his record gave him two rather handsome expensive cigars, which he promptly
[01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:40.020]   left behind in his hotel room in New York next to the set of MaxiPads that the previous
[01:17:40.020 --> 01:17:42.660]   tenant of the hotel room left behind.
[01:17:42.660 --> 01:17:46.580]   These are the kinds of things you'll learn in this fascinating book.
[01:17:46.580 --> 01:17:49.380]   Setting ahead Python scholarship by hours.
[01:17:49.380 --> 01:17:51.860]   Diaries, 1969 and 1979.
[01:17:51.860 --> 01:17:52.860]   The Python years.
[01:17:52.860 --> 01:17:53.860]   Michael Palin, the author.
[01:17:53.860 --> 01:17:54.860]   I didn't know about this.
[01:17:54.860 --> 01:17:56.700]   I am so glad you mentioned it.
[01:17:56.700 --> 01:17:58.540]   I can't wait to read it.
[01:17:58.540 --> 01:18:02.020]   I think that as if I haven't recommended it enough, this is actually...
[01:18:02.020 --> 01:18:03.020]   I am reading it in hardcover.
[01:18:03.020 --> 01:18:07.020]   This is the second copy I bought because I bought it on Amazon for a friend of mine.
[01:18:07.020 --> 01:18:08.020]   And the damn thing about...
[01:18:08.020 --> 01:18:12.220]   You see, if you buy a present for somebody on Amazon, have it gift wrapped at the source.
[01:18:12.220 --> 01:18:14.260]   Because otherwise you're like, "Oh, it is interesting.
[01:18:14.260 --> 01:18:18.380]   I want to reading a page, then like 10 pages, then I realize that I'm just at the point
[01:18:18.380 --> 01:18:19.860]   of I'm going to smudge something."
[01:18:19.860 --> 01:18:25.740]   I had to drive to Barnes and Noble at 9.20 in the evening because I needed to keep reading
[01:18:25.740 --> 01:18:26.740]   this.
[01:18:26.740 --> 01:18:27.740]   Oh, that's funny.
[01:18:27.740 --> 01:18:28.740]   Oh, that's funny.
[01:18:28.740 --> 01:18:30.180]   Our Audible Pick is available for free.
[01:18:30.180 --> 01:18:37.220]   All you got to do is go to audible.com/macbreak, A-U-D-I-B-L-E.com/macbreak and sign up for Audible.
[01:18:37.220 --> 01:18:41.780]   I tell you, 45,000 plus titles, if you've not listened to an audiobook before, this sounds
[01:18:41.780 --> 01:18:46.820]   like it'd be a great one to start with because it's him talking to you and there is something
[01:18:46.820 --> 01:18:48.780]   magical that happens when you listen to audiobooks.
[01:18:48.780 --> 01:18:50.780]   That just doesn't happen in any other form.
[01:18:50.780 --> 01:18:52.580]   Especially a good reader like Michael Pang.
[01:18:52.580 --> 01:18:54.260]   He's telling his own story.
[01:18:54.260 --> 01:18:55.260]   Yeah.
[01:18:55.260 --> 01:18:56.260]   Just fantastic.
[01:18:56.260 --> 01:18:57.260]   Audible.com.
[01:18:57.260 --> 01:18:58.260]   We thank you so much for their support.
[01:18:58.260 --> 01:18:59.260]   We encourage you if you've not yet joined.
[01:18:59.260 --> 01:19:01.020]   I know most of you have.
[01:19:01.020 --> 01:19:05.940]   But if you've not yet joined to give it a try, this fantastic book.
[01:19:05.940 --> 01:19:07.380]   It's time for picks.
[01:19:07.380 --> 01:19:08.660]   Scott Borne, you dropped off for a bit.
[01:19:08.660 --> 01:19:09.660]   You're back?
[01:19:09.660 --> 01:19:10.660]   I'm back.
[01:19:10.660 --> 01:19:11.660]   Thank you, sir.
[01:19:11.660 --> 01:19:14.100]   I have a pick for photographers.
[01:19:14.100 --> 01:19:15.100]   Yay.
[01:19:15.100 --> 01:19:21.900]   It's by a company called Nick Software, NIK, and it is the latest version of their wonderful
[01:19:21.900 --> 01:19:23.460]   plug-in called Color Effects.
[01:19:23.460 --> 01:19:25.580]   The new one's called Color Effects 3.0.
[01:19:25.580 --> 01:19:30.780]   And I like Color Effects Pro, which is the complete edition with all 52 filters, 250
[01:19:30.780 --> 01:19:31.780]   effects.
[01:19:31.780 --> 01:19:36.180]   If you mess around in Photoshop, you see some really cool stuff that a guy like Alex
[01:19:36.180 --> 01:19:38.900]   Lindsey can do, but you're not quite sure how to get there.
[01:19:38.900 --> 01:19:42.460]   You don't need to learn how to do it because with this thing, they've got it all figured
[01:19:42.460 --> 01:19:43.700]   out for you.
[01:19:43.700 --> 01:19:46.700]   I loaded it up and was immediately blown away.
[01:19:46.700 --> 01:19:48.900]   First of all, they've improved the interface dramatically.
[01:19:48.900 --> 01:19:51.700]   It used to be very clue-gy.
[01:19:51.700 --> 01:19:56.540]   Now you have the ability to just drop the filters on from within native Photoshop.
[01:19:56.540 --> 01:19:59.100]   You don't have to run it as a standalone program.
[01:19:59.100 --> 01:20:04.180]   And it's got everything from filters for wedding photographers, nature photographers,
[01:20:04.180 --> 01:20:09.220]   portrait photographers, plus all the standard traditional photography style filters like
[01:20:09.220 --> 01:20:11.140]   warming and cooling and such.
[01:20:11.140 --> 01:20:16.140]   Now they have a standard edition which just has 15 filters for $99.95.
[01:20:16.140 --> 01:20:18.340]   300 months for the completed edition.
[01:20:18.340 --> 01:20:19.980]   Which one do you recommend?
[01:20:19.980 --> 01:20:24.180]   Well, if you're serious, the top one, the line one because...
[01:20:24.180 --> 01:20:26.020]   So you will use those extra filters?
[01:20:26.020 --> 01:20:27.260]   You will use every one of them.
[01:20:27.260 --> 01:20:33.100]   They have stuff like dynamic skin control, which allows you, you know, if you look at
[01:20:33.100 --> 01:20:37.500]   these pictures of models in Vogue and they have this flawless skin, guess what?
[01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:39.300]   Not really.
[01:20:39.300 --> 01:20:43.220]   You know, they use Photoshop effects to get that skin to look like this.
[01:20:43.220 --> 01:20:46.860]   And if you don't want to learn the techniques how to make that happen, you can simply punch
[01:20:46.860 --> 01:20:48.780]   a button and there it is.
[01:20:48.780 --> 01:20:50.940]   Another one that's really cool is film effects.
[01:20:50.940 --> 01:20:54.500]   Those of us who are old enough to remember shooting with Slide Film, you can duplicate
[01:20:54.500 --> 01:20:55.500]   a specific look like...
[01:20:55.500 --> 01:20:56.500]   She can do an Ectochrome.
[01:20:56.500 --> 01:20:59.700]   Yeah, you can do an Ectochrome, a Kodachrome, a Fuji, Velvea.
[01:20:59.700 --> 01:21:00.860]   Oh, that's fantastic.
[01:21:00.860 --> 01:21:02.740]   Yeah, it's really, really neat.
[01:21:02.740 --> 01:21:09.260]   And the only negative about it is that you'll turn your planned two-hour Photoshop.
[01:21:09.260 --> 01:21:12.260]   I'm just going to say, "I'm going to do a Photoshop session into four hours because you'll have so much fun."
[01:21:12.260 --> 01:21:18.260]   I've seen people take very flat, kind of lifeless photos and just with some simple effects like that,
[01:21:18.260 --> 01:21:19.260]   just pop them out.
[01:21:19.260 --> 01:21:20.260]   I mean, they're just amazing.
[01:21:20.260 --> 01:21:23.260]   You can really take a bad picture and make it a great picture.
[01:21:23.260 --> 01:21:25.260]   And this company has been around a long time.
[01:21:25.260 --> 01:21:26.260]   They're reliable.
[01:21:26.260 --> 01:21:28.260]   They're based down there in San Diego.
[01:21:28.260 --> 01:21:29.260]   Give it a look.
[01:21:29.260 --> 01:21:32.260]   Nick Software, nksoftware.com.
[01:21:32.260 --> 01:21:34.260]   Color Effects Pro.
[01:21:34.260 --> 01:21:38.260]   And just as a side, our buddy Adam Christensen works there.
[01:21:38.260 --> 01:21:39.260]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[01:21:39.260 --> 01:21:40.260]   Yeah, stage on.
[01:21:40.260 --> 01:21:41.260]   Oh, that's neat.
[01:21:41.260 --> 01:21:42.260]   Of course, of Maccast.
[01:21:42.260 --> 01:21:44.260]   Oh, I had no idea.
[01:21:44.260 --> 01:21:45.260]   That's great.
[01:21:45.260 --> 01:21:47.260]   Adam's the nicest man in podcasting.
[01:21:47.260 --> 01:21:48.260]   Isn't he sweet?
[01:21:48.260 --> 01:21:49.260]   I just adore him.
[01:21:49.260 --> 01:21:50.260]   Very nice, Adam.
[01:21:50.260 --> 01:21:53.260]   We've been talking ever since I started podcasting.
[01:21:53.260 --> 01:21:54.260]   He was a first.
[01:21:54.260 --> 01:21:57.260]   And I called him when we were going to start Mac Break Weekly and say, "Adam, I don't want
[01:21:57.260 --> 01:22:02.260]   to step on your toes because you're doing a Mac podcast, probably the best-known Mac podcasting.
[01:22:02.260 --> 01:22:04.260]   We're thinking of doing one.
[01:22:04.260 --> 01:22:06.260]   But if you say no, I won't do it."
[01:22:06.260 --> 01:22:07.260]   What are you talking about?
[01:22:07.260 --> 01:22:09.260]   Of course, do it.
[01:22:09.260 --> 01:22:12.900]   He's just completely wonderful, fella.
[01:22:12.900 --> 01:22:17.260]   And we want to plug Maccast because it's still a great Mac podcast.
[01:22:17.260 --> 01:22:18.260]   Merlin Man.
[01:22:18.260 --> 01:22:20.260]   And he did a great job by the way last Thursday.
[01:22:20.260 --> 01:22:21.260]   Oh, I should.
[01:22:21.260 --> 01:22:25.900]   Yeah, go to Maccast because Scott and I were on a panel of podcasters.
[01:22:25.900 --> 01:22:27.460]   Callie Lewis was on it.
[01:22:27.460 --> 01:22:33.140]   A bunch of people talking about podcasting in the Mac community.
[01:22:33.140 --> 01:22:34.140]   And that's on Maccast.com.
[01:22:34.140 --> 01:22:36.300]   In fact, I think I'll put it on my radio Leo feed.
[01:22:36.300 --> 01:22:37.300]   It's a two-parter.
[01:22:37.300 --> 01:22:38.780]   It's a long show.
[01:22:38.780 --> 01:22:40.780]   Who else was there on the panel?
[01:22:40.780 --> 01:22:41.780]   There were a lot of great people.
[01:22:41.780 --> 01:22:43.620]   Well, there was Mac OS Ken.
[01:22:43.620 --> 01:22:44.620]   Of course.
[01:22:44.620 --> 01:22:45.620]   There.
[01:22:45.620 --> 01:22:46.620]   I don't know.
[01:22:46.620 --> 01:22:49.580]   I saw you and then I saw Callie and I kind of quit looking at him.
[01:22:49.580 --> 01:22:51.420]   Callie's so beautiful.
[01:22:51.420 --> 01:22:52.420]   You know, we got to get Ken.
[01:22:52.420 --> 01:22:57.420]   I'm going to get Ken on the show because I think he's a great Mac podcaster.
[01:22:57.420 --> 01:23:00.420]   Merlin Man, do you have a pick of my friend?
[01:23:00.420 --> 01:23:01.420]   I do.
[01:23:01.420 --> 01:23:02.420]   I do.
[01:23:02.420 --> 01:23:03.420]   Speaking of Mac world.
[01:23:03.420 --> 01:23:10.420]   I think the worst kept secret in the Mac community is that all the best stuff in Mac world happens
[01:23:10.420 --> 01:23:11.900]   outside of the Moscone.
[01:23:11.900 --> 01:23:18.260]   You get to meet and occasionally enjoy a beverage with some of your favorite developers.
[01:23:18.260 --> 01:23:20.220]   And that's totally my favorite part.
[01:23:20.220 --> 01:23:24.300]   And so for the second year in a row, I hung out with Paul from Rogue Amoeba, who's a really,
[01:23:24.300 --> 01:23:25.500]   really cool guy.
[01:23:25.500 --> 01:23:28.660]   And I would have to say probably I'm just, I don't keep track of this stuff, but I would
[01:23:28.660 --> 01:23:32.820]   have to guess that Rogue Amoeba has got to be up there near the ambrosia of the world
[01:23:32.820 --> 01:23:36.460]   in terms of number of Mac break picks of the week.
[01:23:36.460 --> 01:23:39.740]   I went and looked because I was happy to say my technical pick.
[01:23:39.740 --> 01:23:43.860]   So first of all, to finish the thought, he gave me some NFRs, like totally out of nowhere,
[01:23:43.860 --> 01:23:45.140]   which was super nice.
[01:23:45.140 --> 01:23:48.060]   And so I've been just kind of lightly messing around with it.
[01:23:48.060 --> 01:23:49.740]   Those are the review copies that reviewers get.
[01:23:49.740 --> 01:23:50.740]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:23:50.740 --> 01:23:57.780]   So I mean, like I own, I own Fish and I own audio hijack pro and I think I own radio shift.
[01:23:57.780 --> 01:24:00.580]   But what I did think that was airfoil.
[01:24:00.580 --> 01:24:01.580]   Have we done airfoil before?
[01:24:01.580 --> 01:24:02.580]   I don't think so.
[01:24:02.580 --> 01:24:03.580]   Oh man.
[01:24:03.580 --> 01:24:04.580]   So, okay.
[01:24:04.580 --> 01:24:07.060]   So disclaimer, I have not spent a huge amount of time with this.
[01:24:07.060 --> 01:24:10.820]   I spent just long enough with this to like have my eyes kind of bugging out.
[01:24:10.820 --> 01:24:15.740]   Airfoil is an app that is similar to air tunes, right?
[01:24:15.740 --> 01:24:20.780]   So the idea of the air tunes is you're listening to iTunes and you can send that to any speakers
[01:24:20.780 --> 01:24:26.660]   that are hooked up to air book or airport expresses that you have in the vicinity, right?
[01:24:26.660 --> 01:24:27.660]   With me so far.
[01:24:27.660 --> 01:24:33.620]   Airfoil lets you send any sound source to those speakers.
[01:24:33.620 --> 01:24:36.620]   So you could, it doesn't have to be iTunes in other words.
[01:24:36.620 --> 01:24:38.980]   So that could be, it could just be your audio output.
[01:24:38.980 --> 01:24:40.620]   It could be real player.
[01:24:40.620 --> 01:24:42.500]   It could be what have you.
[01:24:42.500 --> 01:24:46.540]   Apparently it does the same syncing and what have you.
[01:24:46.540 --> 01:24:52.380]   Very, very, very cool idea for an application and the latest version that just came out.
[01:24:52.380 --> 01:24:55.220]   I mean, I'm still kind of getting my head around this because it's kind of mind boggling.
[01:24:55.220 --> 01:24:59.100]   But now it includes what's called the airfoil video player.
[01:24:59.100 --> 01:25:05.220]   So you can now send video synced all off air tunes, send synced video to multiple sources
[01:25:05.220 --> 01:25:07.620]   of this.
[01:25:07.620 --> 01:25:10.340]   And it's a very, very pretty app.
[01:25:10.340 --> 01:25:11.500]   I'm not even sure what it costs.
[01:25:11.500 --> 01:25:14.740]   Oh my God, $25 for this.
[01:25:14.740 --> 01:25:17.060]   And I have spent a huge amount of time with it.
[01:25:17.060 --> 01:25:18.780]   I've been, I'm really impressed with all of his stuff.
[01:25:18.780 --> 01:25:24.020]   I always have been, I think anybody who is looking at ways to hack up audio on their
[01:25:24.020 --> 01:25:26.020]   Mac is eventually going to end up with Rogenme.
[01:25:26.020 --> 01:25:31.820]   But oh, also Scott Borne, the SoundSource app has now been updated for Leopard.
[01:25:31.820 --> 01:25:36.420]   So they're free app called SoundSource, which lets you change your inputs, which if you
[01:25:36.420 --> 01:25:39.220]   use the hated Skype, you're doing all the time.
[01:25:39.220 --> 01:25:40.220]   That is out in Leopard version.
[01:25:40.220 --> 01:25:41.220]   Anyway.
[01:25:41.220 --> 01:25:44.020]   Instead of using Audio-Hydric Pro, this gives you that kind of capability to switch.
[01:25:44.020 --> 01:25:48.220]   This lets you, this is a menu that the, sorry, I'm changing topics a lot.
[01:25:48.220 --> 01:25:50.980]   The SoundSource is a menu extra.
[01:25:50.980 --> 01:25:52.220]   Input, output, system.
[01:25:52.220 --> 01:25:53.220]   Oh, that's cool.
[01:25:53.220 --> 01:25:55.620]   So you can quickly change and say, "Okay, auto switch to headphones."
[01:25:55.620 --> 01:25:56.620]   Like make sure that happens.
[01:25:56.620 --> 01:25:59.700]   Anyway, it's just in a large sense, I'm just in terms of total disclosure.
[01:25:59.700 --> 01:26:02.620]   I just think Rogenme was a great company and I like Paul a lot.
[01:26:02.620 --> 01:26:04.820]   And it's to an app.
[01:26:04.820 --> 01:26:08.940]   Every one of his pieces of software that I've used has been fantastic.
[01:26:08.940 --> 01:26:12.700]   And he's a great pillar of the IndyMac community.
[01:26:12.700 --> 01:26:13.700]   Sure is.
[01:26:13.700 --> 01:26:19.620]   And so Airfoil $25 is Rogenmeba.com, R-O-G-U-E-A-M-O-E-B-A.
[01:26:19.620 --> 01:26:21.660]   That does not pass the Tarmac test.
[01:26:21.660 --> 01:26:24.820]   It would be very hard to say to somebody while your plane's taking off.
[01:26:24.820 --> 01:26:27.460]   But Rogenmeba.com and Airfoil.
[01:26:27.460 --> 01:26:29.260]   Excellent choice.
[01:26:29.260 --> 01:26:30.260]   Alex B. Lindsey.
[01:26:30.260 --> 01:26:34.420]   Leo, I have an appointment in as I really need to go.
[01:26:34.420 --> 01:26:35.420]   Annie and I go.
[01:26:35.420 --> 01:26:37.820]   I have enough time for a quick fork pick.
[01:26:37.820 --> 01:26:41.580]   The $250 remote control.
[01:26:41.580 --> 01:26:45.020]   And this is the point which most of our lift-ness are now skipping to the next track on the
[01:26:45.020 --> 01:26:46.020]   right.
[01:26:46.020 --> 01:26:47.020]   It's still only a third of an Alex now.
[01:26:47.020 --> 01:26:48.020]   Come on.
[01:26:48.020 --> 01:26:49.020]   I think Scott and I both own it.
[01:26:49.020 --> 01:26:50.020]   Yes.
[01:26:50.020 --> 01:26:52.020]   There you go.
[01:26:52.020 --> 01:26:54.940]   The answer is what is the Logitech Harmony 1 remote?
[01:26:54.940 --> 01:26:55.940]   Hey.
[01:26:55.940 --> 01:27:00.740]   I just got this a couple of days ago and I did have the exact same reaction saying,
[01:27:00.740 --> 01:27:06.860]   "Okay, so I can either have another DVD burner or I can have 10 DVDs or I can have a really
[01:27:06.860 --> 01:27:11.100]   cool awesome new remote control for my television and OSET."
[01:27:11.100 --> 01:27:12.780]   But it's actually fairly cool.
[01:27:12.780 --> 01:27:15.740]   Now there's also a way to get this sort of thing for $85.
[01:27:15.740 --> 01:27:17.460]   So stick with me here.
[01:27:17.460 --> 01:27:21.740]   The coolest thing about this is that it is a universal remote that will not only control
[01:27:21.740 --> 01:27:26.220]   basically everything you've got, but also do sequences of key presses so that it understands
[01:27:26.220 --> 01:27:30.420]   that if I want to listen to digital music, it means that, "Okay, turn off everything,
[01:27:30.420 --> 01:27:34.620]   but the TV set and the Apple TV and then switch over to this specific input so I can start
[01:27:34.620 --> 01:27:35.620]   listening to music that way."
[01:27:35.620 --> 01:27:38.620]   And you can do even more complex sequences than that.
[01:27:38.620 --> 01:27:43.580]   But the big deal is that it has a database of like more than $100,000.
[01:27:43.580 --> 01:27:48.060]   I think it's something like 230,000 different devices and the way that you program it is
[01:27:48.060 --> 01:27:53.540]   that you simply plug it into the USB port of your Mac, launch a certain application,
[01:27:53.540 --> 01:27:55.860]   and then just simply tell it about all the devices you have.
[01:27:55.860 --> 01:27:59.820]   Just simply plug in, "I've got a Sony KV, whatever, whatever, whatever."
[01:27:59.820 --> 01:28:01.340]   And it'll say, "Oh, I know what that is.
[01:28:01.340 --> 01:28:02.900]   Great, you're all programmed.
[01:28:02.900 --> 01:28:05.460]   What do you want to do with your Sony TV?"
[01:28:05.460 --> 01:28:06.460]   Launch television.
[01:28:06.460 --> 01:28:07.460]   Good.
[01:28:07.460 --> 01:28:10.660]   Okay, so now we'll just automatically add in a mini-rotter that says, "Watch TV."
[01:28:10.660 --> 01:28:12.460]   It's right on the other side of the new screen today.
[01:28:12.460 --> 01:28:14.820]   And that in itself is pretty cool.
[01:28:14.820 --> 01:28:17.300]   What really impressed me is the troubleshooting mode.
[01:28:17.300 --> 01:28:22.220]   Now there was a couple of different spots in the software that's a little bit woolly where
[01:28:22.220 --> 01:28:28.140]   I would much rather go through all these walkthrough wizards.
[01:28:28.140 --> 01:28:30.980]   Simply say, "Look, okay, I've got the Apple TV on video 3.
[01:28:30.980 --> 01:28:32.700]   Can I just tell you it's on video 3?
[01:28:32.700 --> 01:28:36.700]   Do I have to explain the story of my video system?"
[01:28:36.700 --> 01:28:39.020]   And I don't think I was able to actually convince it correctly.
[01:28:39.020 --> 01:28:41.820]   And I thought, "Oh, God, this is $250."
[01:28:41.820 --> 01:28:47.180]   But then I press a button, I update the remote, unplug it, take it to my living room, press
[01:28:47.180 --> 01:28:48.420]   a button.
[01:28:48.420 --> 01:28:54.740]   And the screen, which is a beautiful color screen, a large color screen, says, "If there
[01:28:54.740 --> 01:28:56.460]   are any problems, touch the help button."
[01:28:56.460 --> 01:28:58.820]   I said, "Well, gee, there was a problem because my TV is not on."
[01:28:58.820 --> 01:29:00.180]   Okay, help.
[01:29:00.180 --> 01:29:01.180]   Is the TV on?
[01:29:01.180 --> 01:29:03.100]   Yes, no.
[01:29:03.100 --> 01:29:04.100]   No.
[01:29:04.100 --> 01:29:06.380]   Then suddenly the TV turns on.
[01:29:06.380 --> 01:29:08.020]   Is it on now?
[01:29:08.020 --> 01:29:09.020]   Ooh.
[01:29:09.020 --> 01:29:10.020]   Yes.
[01:29:10.020 --> 01:29:11.900]   Are there any other problems?
[01:29:11.900 --> 01:29:12.900]   No.
[01:29:12.900 --> 01:29:18.020]   So it's kind of like that weedy guy from Corporate Tech Support who will sort of sort of take
[01:29:18.020 --> 01:29:20.660]   an attitude with you, but he'll definitely fix it for you.
[01:29:20.660 --> 01:29:24.300]   And once you fix it once, it understands that, "Okay, it looks like I got this wrong in the
[01:29:24.300 --> 01:29:25.300]   promote in the programming.
[01:29:25.300 --> 01:29:26.300]   Don't worry, it's fixed now.
[01:29:26.300 --> 01:29:28.460]   It'll work fine from here on out."
[01:29:28.460 --> 01:29:32.260]   And the other great feature is that even if it were just a basic learning remote, it's
[01:29:32.260 --> 01:29:37.380]   one of the most comfortable to hold, comfortable to operate buttons, remotes, both on how it's
[01:29:37.380 --> 01:29:42.380]   shaped and how it fits in your hand and also about how big and bumped up and sculptured
[01:29:42.380 --> 01:29:43.380]   the buttons are.
[01:29:43.380 --> 01:29:46.380]   It really feels great in your hand.
[01:29:46.380 --> 01:29:52.420]   The biggest advantage that it has, that's really the biggest advantage it has over one
[01:29:52.420 --> 01:29:56.900]   of the previous models in the Log Check line, the Logitech Harmony 550.
[01:29:56.900 --> 01:30:02.180]   So if all you want is this really cool docket to USB and just tell it you'd describe what
[01:30:02.180 --> 01:30:07.180]   you got and it'll fix everything for you, the Logitech 550 Harmony only costs 85.
[01:30:07.180 --> 01:30:12.740]   On Amazon, as opposed to 250 bucks for the Harmony 1, it does not have this cool color
[01:30:12.740 --> 01:30:14.100]   touchscreen.
[01:30:14.100 --> 01:30:16.220]   The layout of the buttons is not quite so nice.
[01:30:16.220 --> 01:30:18.180]   It's not quite so well sculpted.
[01:30:18.180 --> 01:30:24.860]   But again, that's the cost of this remote plus, say, 8 DVDs that you've been wanting
[01:30:24.860 --> 01:30:27.100]   to buy as opposed to the Harmony 250.
[01:30:27.100 --> 01:30:31.500]   I mean, the way that I tend to relate to it is that if you've already spent, if you're
[01:30:31.500 --> 01:30:37.580]   in Best Buy, you've already spent $2,710 on the great new TV for the Super Bowl and the
[01:30:37.580 --> 01:30:42.180]   great new stereo speakers and everything like that, you may as well just round it up.
[01:30:42.180 --> 01:30:44.140]   You're going to be in trouble when you get home with this anyway.
[01:30:44.140 --> 01:30:47.380]   You may as well round it up to 3,000 and get a great remote with it.
[01:30:47.380 --> 01:30:48.380]   All right.
[01:30:48.380 --> 01:30:51.140]   You also might want to look at the Harmony 1000, which is my favorite.
[01:30:51.140 --> 01:30:54.220]   This is the new one though, the Harmony 1, which looks like it has a lot of the...
[01:30:54.220 --> 01:30:56.500]   That's the one that morphs into liquid metal, isn't it?
[01:30:56.500 --> 01:30:57.500]   Yeah.
[01:30:57.500 --> 01:31:05.620]   The 1000 is for the... it's got kind of a screen on it and it's kind of the Ozzy Osborn set.
[01:31:05.620 --> 01:31:08.220]   It's 500 bucks, but it does all the things.
[01:31:08.220 --> 01:31:11.820]   Kevin, how do you turn on the TV?
[01:31:11.820 --> 01:31:13.500]   All right, Andy and Oka, we're going to let you go.
[01:31:13.500 --> 01:31:18.500]   Andy and Oka's celestial waste of bandwidth is at www.cwob.com.
[01:31:18.500 --> 01:31:23.700]   Don't look for his new book, iPhone, fully loaded and stores everywhere.
[01:31:23.700 --> 01:31:25.340]   And of course, he writes for the Chicago Sun times.
[01:31:25.340 --> 01:31:26.340]   Thanks, Andy.
[01:31:26.340 --> 01:31:27.340]   Thanks, guys.
[01:31:27.340 --> 01:31:28.340]   Big go to your parents.
[01:31:28.340 --> 01:31:29.340]   Bye.
[01:31:29.340 --> 01:31:30.340]   Oh, that's...
[01:31:30.340 --> 01:31:33.060]   You know, he's really... he's a very inspiring guy.
[01:31:33.060 --> 01:31:35.620]   His whole life is just very inspirational to me.
[01:31:35.620 --> 01:31:36.620]   Really?
[01:31:36.620 --> 01:31:37.620]   Yeah, he makes me want to wear hats.
[01:31:37.620 --> 01:31:39.140]   He makes me want to grow chops.
[01:31:39.140 --> 01:31:40.740]   He plays the ukulele.
[01:31:40.740 --> 01:31:41.740]   Really?
[01:31:41.740 --> 01:31:43.260]   Is there anything you can't do?
[01:31:43.260 --> 01:31:44.420]   Nothing he can't do.
[01:31:44.420 --> 01:31:45.420]   My goodness.
[01:31:45.420 --> 01:31:52.020]   Now, poor Alex Lindsey from his sick bed with his pick of the week.
[01:31:52.020 --> 01:31:54.900]   So I like to make databases.
[01:31:54.900 --> 01:31:57.460]   You know, I know it's a little bit...
[01:31:57.460 --> 01:31:59.460]   You're a list guy.
[01:31:59.460 --> 01:32:00.460]   I really like...
[01:32:00.460 --> 01:32:02.900]   I mean, for about...
[01:32:02.900 --> 01:32:08.060]   I had file maker almost as long as it's been available.
[01:32:08.060 --> 01:32:09.700]   And I've always just...
[01:32:09.700 --> 01:32:12.780]   When I needed to organize a bunch of stuff, I was never an Excel person.
[01:32:12.780 --> 01:32:19.180]   In fact, I've never really done spreadsheets until numbers came out, which I love.
[01:32:19.180 --> 01:32:20.180]   But I...
[01:32:20.180 --> 01:32:21.980]   You know, it was a lot of times I wanted to build the database because I didn't want
[01:32:21.980 --> 01:32:24.340]   it to be in these little Excel kind of crap.
[01:32:24.340 --> 01:32:25.340]   I wanted to be...
[01:32:25.340 --> 01:32:30.180]   I wanted to organize how it looked, you know, and where everything was and made it ergonomically,
[01:32:30.180 --> 01:32:33.540]   you know, what I wanted, what I'm adding data into a database.
[01:32:33.540 --> 01:32:37.900]   And anyway, so I was always doing this stuff.
[01:32:37.900 --> 01:32:41.020]   And I'm not an expert at file makers.
[01:32:41.020 --> 01:32:42.780]   It's not like I can build big relational databases.
[01:32:42.780 --> 01:32:46.420]   I just build lots of stuff that just grabs all my data.
[01:32:46.420 --> 01:32:47.420]   And they have released...
[01:32:47.420 --> 01:32:51.140]   The problem was is I really only used about 10% of file maker, you know what I mean?
[01:32:51.140 --> 01:32:52.620]   I just do everything that I was doing.
[01:32:52.620 --> 01:32:53.620]   And it's really...
[01:32:53.620 --> 01:32:56.540]   It's a little geeky when you're working with file maker.
[01:32:56.540 --> 01:32:59.980]   You're kind of, you know, Command-Shift-D and you're kind of adding these files.
[01:32:59.980 --> 01:33:03.620]   And if you don't add them the right way, it screws up the way the lists work and everything
[01:33:03.620 --> 01:33:04.620]   else.
[01:33:04.620 --> 01:33:06.300]   And so one of the things that I...
[01:33:06.300 --> 01:33:07.780]   My pick for this week is Bento.
[01:33:07.780 --> 01:33:09.020]   Have you guys seen Bento?
[01:33:09.020 --> 01:33:11.620]   Yeah, we all got a copy at Macworld, actually.
[01:33:11.620 --> 01:33:13.180]   Because I got a review copy.
[01:33:13.180 --> 01:33:14.900]   I mean, I got like their preview copy.
[01:33:14.900 --> 01:33:17.740]   The day it came out, I was so excited and started playing with it.
[01:33:17.740 --> 01:33:19.540]   And then we did get a review copy.
[01:33:19.540 --> 01:33:22.220]   We all got a copy of speakers at Macworld.
[01:33:22.220 --> 01:33:27.980]   And it's just, I think it's a great, easy database that does most of the stuff that...
[01:33:27.980 --> 01:33:31.300]   I don't know if it does all of it yet, but it does most of the stuff, the kind of stuff
[01:33:31.300 --> 01:33:32.940]   that I was organizing as far as data goes.
[01:33:32.940 --> 01:33:34.900]   It works a lot like it really...
[01:33:34.900 --> 01:33:39.300]   As soon as I opened it, I thought, "Wow, this really takes me back to the 90s in a good
[01:33:39.300 --> 01:33:41.260]   way because there's something so empowering."
[01:33:41.260 --> 01:33:44.420]   I know exactly what you're talking about, Alex, because like for a certain kind of mindset,
[01:33:44.420 --> 01:33:47.340]   you use Excel and for a different kind of mindset for things you use a file maker.
[01:33:47.340 --> 01:33:50.940]   And there was something about file maker, I like to quickly whip up a database that did
[01:33:50.940 --> 01:33:51.940]   stuff.
[01:33:51.940 --> 01:33:55.060]   And I immediately had that feeling with Bento of like, "Oh, this is so much like file maker,
[01:33:55.060 --> 01:33:56.220]   but it's so much easier to use."
[01:33:56.220 --> 01:33:57.220]   But easier and cheaper.
[01:33:57.220 --> 01:33:58.220]   Yeah.
[01:33:58.220 --> 01:33:59.220]   You mean, and it's 49...
[01:33:59.220 --> 01:34:01.020]   It's not nice to stock stuff with it.
[01:34:01.020 --> 01:34:02.020]   It's too, I finally...
[01:34:02.020 --> 01:34:06.500]   I'm sorry to mean to hijack your call, but I've been really frustrated trying to find
[01:34:06.500 --> 01:34:08.660]   decent home inventory software.
[01:34:08.660 --> 01:34:10.300]   It's all so yucky.
[01:34:10.300 --> 01:34:13.220]   And this is the one, that's one of the things that shifts with this, which I think is a
[01:34:13.220 --> 01:34:14.220]   good decision.
[01:34:14.220 --> 01:34:15.220]   And it looks pretty good.
[01:34:15.220 --> 01:34:17.780]   I haven't really dug into it, but it's very macky.
[01:34:17.780 --> 01:34:18.780]   Okay.
[01:34:18.780 --> 01:34:19.780]   Is it as flexible as file maker?
[01:34:19.780 --> 01:34:21.540]   I mean, can you design your own layouts and stuff?
[01:34:21.540 --> 01:34:23.300]   Yeah, you can design your own layouts.
[01:34:23.300 --> 01:34:27.020]   Well, here's the best part is that you do have things like an inventory database, but
[01:34:27.020 --> 01:34:30.740]   the problem when you buy an inventory database is you get it the way that they wanted to
[01:34:30.740 --> 01:34:32.580]   give it to you, and that's it.
[01:34:32.580 --> 01:34:33.860]   You know, here you have...
[01:34:33.860 --> 01:34:36.660]   You get the inventory database and, "Oh, if I want to change the names of some of the
[01:34:36.660 --> 01:34:40.180]   stuff or move it around or adjust it, I can do all of those things.
[01:34:40.180 --> 01:34:41.340]   You know, I can add other fields.
[01:34:41.340 --> 01:34:42.340]   I can add other pieces.
[01:34:42.340 --> 01:34:43.740]   I can add all kinds of other pieces."
[01:34:43.740 --> 01:34:47.500]   And it feels like you're working in iTunes, but for data.
[01:34:47.500 --> 01:34:49.780]   You know, so it's a very, very mack.
[01:34:49.780 --> 01:34:51.340]   I mean, I think it's leopard only.
[01:34:51.340 --> 01:34:52.340]   It's not even a tiger.
[01:34:52.340 --> 01:34:55.500]   It's like leopard only database program.
[01:34:55.500 --> 01:34:57.620]   And so it's very mack feeling.
[01:34:57.620 --> 01:35:01.500]   And it is, as I said, it's just a...
[01:35:01.500 --> 01:35:05.340]   You get those templates and hopefully, you know, typically in the file maker community,
[01:35:05.340 --> 01:35:08.700]   more people will make more templates and you'll be able to buy them for 10 bucks or whatever.
[01:35:08.700 --> 01:35:11.020]   So this sounds like file maker light then, basically.
[01:35:11.020 --> 01:35:12.020]   It is.
[01:35:12.020 --> 01:35:14.780]   It's very much a file maker light, but it's not just that they cut down features.
[01:35:14.780 --> 01:35:16.620]   They made it easier to use.
[01:35:16.620 --> 01:35:18.180]   It feels like an eye workout.
[01:35:18.180 --> 01:35:19.180]   Yeah.
[01:35:19.180 --> 01:35:20.180]   Yeah.
[01:35:20.180 --> 01:35:24.340]   So at Macworld, that is one of our Macworld shows, and the kind of consensus was, "Well,
[01:35:24.340 --> 01:35:25.340]   huh?"
[01:35:25.340 --> 01:35:26.340]   Like...
[01:35:26.340 --> 01:35:27.340]   You know what's funny though?
[01:35:27.340 --> 01:35:29.260]   And I think it was Gruber that pointed this out, but you know, I...
[01:35:29.260 --> 01:35:30.980]   Nothing in the world against file maker.
[01:35:30.980 --> 01:35:34.420]   Like I love file maker, but I still, every year I go to Macworld and I'm like, "Wow,
[01:35:34.420 --> 01:35:36.980]   that is such a big booth for a file maker."
[01:35:36.980 --> 01:35:39.900]   I'm just like, because I mean, just again, this is just the color of my crystal, but
[01:35:39.900 --> 01:35:41.700]   I'm always like, "Man, it turns out."
[01:35:41.700 --> 01:35:45.980]   Like, there's a lot of people who are just crazy about file maker, but the fact is, I
[01:35:45.980 --> 01:35:49.180]   mean, like, it was the bento demonstrations that were packing them in.
[01:35:49.180 --> 01:35:51.060]   Because people were like, "It's very Mac-y."
[01:35:51.060 --> 01:35:52.740]   I mean, when you start playing with it, it feels very...
[01:35:52.740 --> 01:35:53.740]   You know what I mean?
[01:35:53.740 --> 01:35:54.980]   It's got that feel to it.
[01:35:54.980 --> 01:35:55.980]   Yeah.
[01:35:55.980 --> 01:35:58.300]   And the old file maker, I mean, as I said, it's one of those things that is like part
[01:35:58.300 --> 01:36:02.260]   of my DNA when it comes to organizing any kind of project.
[01:36:02.260 --> 01:36:05.180]   And so it always mystified me in how...
[01:36:05.180 --> 01:36:06.620]   I said, "Just build a database.
[01:36:06.620 --> 01:36:09.020]   Just go into FileMaker and just make a database out of it."
[01:36:09.020 --> 01:36:11.540]   And people would be like, "They get lost in FileMaker."
[01:36:11.540 --> 01:36:13.140]   And I was like, "How can you get lost in FileMaker?"
[01:36:13.140 --> 01:36:14.140]   But it really is.
[01:36:14.140 --> 01:36:16.660]   I mean, until you know what those little keys are, it's a real...
[01:36:16.660 --> 01:36:20.460]   It can be a little bit daunting to figure out how to customize stuff and make lists and
[01:36:20.460 --> 01:36:22.620]   do all the things that you want to do.
[01:36:22.620 --> 01:36:25.580]   And this makes it all really easy.
[01:36:25.580 --> 01:36:27.260]   And it does exactly what Merlin said.
[01:36:27.260 --> 01:36:28.260]   It's really like an eye workout.
[01:36:28.260 --> 01:36:32.700]   Remember if you quit it without closing?
[01:36:32.700 --> 01:36:34.220]   Remember what would corrupt the database?
[01:36:34.220 --> 01:36:35.220]   Oh, great.
[01:36:35.220 --> 01:36:36.700]   No, no, no, this is back in the day.
[01:36:36.700 --> 01:36:37.700]   I'm just remembering.
[01:36:37.700 --> 01:36:41.660]   I'm just remembering, like, I used to have to run it off a network, off a local talk
[01:36:41.660 --> 01:36:43.700]   network for about 20 people.
[01:36:43.700 --> 01:36:48.420]   And I'd have to go and personally yell at somebody if they quit out of the app without
[01:36:48.420 --> 01:36:49.420]   closing.
[01:36:49.420 --> 01:36:51.420]   That was a long time ago.
[01:36:51.420 --> 01:36:52.420]   It was a long time ago.
[01:36:52.420 --> 01:36:53.420]   And it's a...
[01:36:53.420 --> 01:36:54.420]   But you're right.
[01:36:54.420 --> 01:36:55.420]   Vento's what?
[01:36:55.420 --> 01:36:56.420]   50 bucks?
[01:36:56.420 --> 01:36:57.260]   $50, you know.
[01:36:57.260 --> 01:37:02.860]   And so it really is one of those apps that I think that if people like to organize stuff,
[01:37:02.860 --> 01:37:07.980]   when they're trying to organize their ideas or their inventory or just figuring out how
[01:37:07.980 --> 01:37:10.380]   they're going to add stuff into something and they want to make something that looks
[01:37:10.380 --> 01:37:12.940]   pretty that's easy to use.
[01:37:12.940 --> 01:37:17.060]   This is the best solution I've seen so far where they can really change the...
[01:37:17.060 --> 01:37:22.380]   Really mold it into the format or into the interface that they want to add that data.
[01:37:22.380 --> 01:37:23.380]   Yeah.
[01:37:23.380 --> 01:37:24.580]   Well, I'll reinstall it.
[01:37:24.580 --> 01:37:25.780]   I'll take a second look.
[01:37:25.780 --> 01:37:26.780]   I put it on.
[01:37:26.780 --> 01:37:27.780]   It was a big home for me.
[01:37:27.780 --> 01:37:31.340]   And I used a lot of file maker in my time.
[01:37:31.340 --> 01:37:36.260]   In fact, I used a file maker to keep track of all my guests on my old radio show in the
[01:37:36.260 --> 01:37:37.260]   80s.
[01:37:37.260 --> 01:37:39.420]   I had 5,000 guests in that database.
[01:37:39.420 --> 01:37:40.420]   So I'm looking for...
[01:37:40.420 --> 01:37:43.860]   You were supposed to keep track of the guests, Lee?
[01:37:43.860 --> 01:37:44.860]   I had everybody...
[01:37:44.860 --> 01:37:45.860]   It did.
[01:37:45.860 --> 01:37:48.100]   When I did, this is such a great now.
[01:37:48.100 --> 01:37:49.460]   It can be told thing.
[01:37:49.460 --> 01:37:54.980]   In the mid 90s, my main job was creating websites via a subcontractor of a subcontractor.
[01:37:54.980 --> 01:37:56.700]   I did like the PC Expo site.
[01:37:56.700 --> 01:37:57.700]   I did DB Expo.
[01:37:57.700 --> 01:37:59.940]   I did all those big trade show sites.
[01:37:59.940 --> 01:38:02.780]   And they were all run out of I would do a text import.
[01:38:02.780 --> 01:38:04.140]   This is so embarrassing.
[01:38:04.140 --> 01:38:09.500]   I would do a text import of a flat file into file maker and then output using fields.
[01:38:09.500 --> 01:38:13.780]   I would output into separate text files with BB Edit includes.
[01:38:13.780 --> 01:38:18.140]   I would output the entire PC Expo exhibitor list using file maker pro and it took like
[01:38:18.140 --> 01:38:19.140]   three hours.
[01:38:19.140 --> 01:38:20.140]   Wow.
[01:38:20.140 --> 01:38:21.140]   Wow.
[01:38:21.140 --> 01:38:23.140]   What did you do for three hours, Merlin?
[01:38:23.140 --> 01:38:26.060]   Well, the computer was on and it was a...
[01:38:26.060 --> 01:38:28.060]   No, but I mean, it was a very...
[01:38:28.060 --> 01:38:29.060]   It was a very...
[01:38:29.060 --> 01:38:31.340]   I mean, because the stuff that came before it, gosh, what was that one?
[01:38:31.340 --> 01:38:32.340]   Like double helix.
[01:38:32.340 --> 01:38:35.220]   There was all those databases that were like pretty complicated.
[01:38:35.220 --> 01:38:37.940]   I was like, yeah, I don't have to use hypercard to do this anymore.
[01:38:37.940 --> 01:38:39.940]   And I was like, it was a mind blower.
[01:38:39.940 --> 01:38:40.940]   Yeah.
[01:38:40.940 --> 01:38:42.420]   Yeah, I know it was...
[01:38:42.420 --> 01:38:43.420]   Yeah.
[01:38:43.420 --> 01:38:44.900]   I like our Mac nostalgia talks.
[01:38:44.900 --> 01:38:45.900]   It makes me feel warm.
[01:38:45.900 --> 01:38:47.100]   Oh, the good old days.
[01:38:47.100 --> 01:38:48.100]   The good old days.
[01:38:48.100 --> 01:38:49.100]   Hey, I want to...
[01:38:49.100 --> 01:38:54.500]   Before I do my pick, I want to thank Stephen D, who very kindly explained to me how to
[01:38:54.500 --> 01:39:02.060]   get a nice icon for the new iPod Touch and the iPhone 113 for the web clipping.
[01:39:02.060 --> 01:39:03.060]   And he sent me...
[01:39:03.060 --> 01:39:04.500]   He actually made one for Twitch.
[01:39:04.500 --> 01:39:09.420]   So if you now, if you do a web clipping on your iPhone or your iTouch, you'll get a nice
[01:39:09.420 --> 01:39:10.700]   little icon for it.
[01:39:10.700 --> 01:39:12.740]   You just create a ping.
[01:39:12.740 --> 01:39:16.260]   He said 57 by 57 and I've actually been told later that it's better if you make it even
[01:39:16.260 --> 01:39:17.260]   higher resolution.
[01:39:17.260 --> 01:39:21.220]   I think it was 158 by 158.
[01:39:21.220 --> 01:39:22.700]   And Apple does this really nice thing.
[01:39:22.700 --> 01:39:27.820]   It puts a little glare on it, the glass effect, and that's pretty cool.
[01:39:27.820 --> 01:39:33.140]   So if you want to bookmark.tv or leoville.com on your iPhone or iPod Touch, you'll see it
[01:39:33.140 --> 01:39:35.500]   has a nice icon thanks to Stephen D.
[01:39:35.500 --> 01:39:39.300]   And that leads to my pick of the week, which is Fluid.
[01:39:39.300 --> 01:39:40.700]   You guys heard about Fluid?
[01:39:40.700 --> 01:39:41.700]   No.
[01:39:41.700 --> 01:39:42.700]   Oh, good.
[01:39:42.700 --> 01:39:44.500]   I got something for you.
[01:39:44.500 --> 01:39:46.940]   More and more we're using web applications these days.
[01:39:46.940 --> 01:39:53.540]   The Gmail, Basecamp, Google Reader, Facebook, Yahoo mail, you know, and the problem is they're
[01:39:53.540 --> 01:39:54.540]   web-based.
[01:39:54.540 --> 01:39:55.540]   They're not apps.
[01:39:55.540 --> 01:39:58.980]   Fluid does this really cool thing for OS 10 Leopard.
[01:39:58.980 --> 01:40:04.900]   It turns your favorite web-based app into an app app that sits in your application folder,
[01:40:04.900 --> 01:40:07.100]   has the appropriate dock icon.
[01:40:07.100 --> 01:40:08.100]   You can click it.
[01:40:08.100 --> 01:40:12.140]   I mean, it's obviously using WebKit as a pretty straightforward thing, but I have to say they've
[01:40:12.140 --> 01:40:13.140]   done a nice job.
[01:40:13.140 --> 01:40:14.700]   It supports Growl.
[01:40:14.700 --> 01:40:18.660]   It has dock badges, dock menus for some of the biggest apps that you would use, including
[01:40:18.660 --> 01:40:20.900]   Flickr, Gmail, Google Reader, Facebook.
[01:40:20.900 --> 01:40:24.500]   You can install this for Alex and he'd feel like he's using applications.
[01:40:24.500 --> 01:40:25.500]   Yeah.
[01:40:25.500 --> 01:40:26.500]   All right.
[01:40:26.500 --> 01:40:27.500]   Yep.
[01:40:27.500 --> 01:40:28.500]   It supports Sparkle.
[01:40:28.500 --> 01:40:31.300]   Fluid app, F-L-U-I-D-A-P-P.com.
[01:40:31.300 --> 01:40:35.980]   I've used it for a number of the web apps I use all the time and I just think it's simple,
[01:40:35.980 --> 01:40:38.860]   but it's great, absolutely free.
[01:40:38.860 --> 01:40:41.100]   It does exactly the job you'd want to do.
[01:40:41.100 --> 01:40:45.820]   Basically, it's kind of like the web-clipping feature in the dashboard, but it's a true
[01:40:45.820 --> 01:40:49.060]   standalone full-fledged app.
[01:40:49.060 --> 01:40:53.180]   I imagine since it's using WebKit, anything that works well with Safari would work just
[01:40:53.180 --> 01:40:54.180]   fine.
[01:40:54.180 --> 01:40:58.460]   I'm now putting the, we use Google Spreadsheets to keep track of, for instance, our Audible
[01:40:58.460 --> 01:41:02.500]   Pics and that makes it so much easier for me to do this.
[01:41:02.500 --> 01:41:03.500]   Fluid app.
[01:41:03.500 --> 01:41:05.500]   Yeah, it's a simple little thing.
[01:41:05.500 --> 01:41:06.940]   I think I saw it on the Twitter.
[01:41:06.940 --> 01:41:07.940]   I love the Twitter.
[01:41:07.940 --> 01:41:08.940]   I love the Twitter.
[01:41:08.940 --> 01:41:09.940]   I love the Google.
[01:41:09.940 --> 01:41:10.940]   I love the Google.
[01:41:10.940 --> 01:41:11.940]   Loosing the Twitter more.
[01:41:11.940 --> 01:41:15.700]   You know, I had the red ring of death yesterday and Microsoft immediately got a hold of me
[01:41:15.700 --> 01:41:17.300]   because I twitted it.
[01:41:17.300 --> 01:41:18.300]   No way.
[01:41:18.300 --> 01:41:19.300]   There's the power.
[01:41:19.300 --> 01:41:20.820]   I don't know if that'll work for everyone.
[01:41:20.820 --> 01:41:22.380]   We're unleashing the power of your Twitter.
[01:41:22.380 --> 01:41:24.820]   The power of my Twitter, my 12-inch Twitter.
[01:41:24.820 --> 01:41:28.380]   All right, ladies and gentlemen, I think this is now the time when the show did you
[01:41:28.380 --> 01:41:30.540]   generate into depravity.
[01:41:30.540 --> 01:41:34.740]   So I think, or depravity, and I think maybe time for us to say goodbye.
[01:41:34.740 --> 01:41:38.380]   I got to go to the gym and work out.
[01:41:38.380 --> 01:41:39.900]   I thank you all for joining us.
[01:41:39.900 --> 01:41:43.820]   Scott Bourn is, of course, Mr. Apple Phone Show at applephoneshow.com.
[01:41:43.820 --> 01:41:48.900]   Catch him at Padango, padango.com and all over the place.
[01:41:48.900 --> 01:41:52.820]   But mostly he's the guy in a vest on Mac Break Weekly.
[01:41:52.820 --> 01:41:55.740]   Got a new, she got a new show with Alex.
[01:41:55.740 --> 01:41:56.740]   Really?
[01:41:56.740 --> 01:41:57.740]   He's making photography.
[01:41:57.740 --> 01:41:58.740]   You're going to do that.
[01:41:58.740 --> 01:41:59.740]   Oh, I'm so glad.
[01:41:59.740 --> 01:42:00.740]   We recorded one.
[01:42:00.740 --> 01:42:02.740]   I'm going to make you guys jealous.
[01:42:02.740 --> 01:42:04.780]   I'm going to make you guys really jealous.
[01:42:04.780 --> 01:42:05.780]   How's that?
[01:42:05.780 --> 01:42:06.780]   How's that Mac world expo?
[01:42:06.780 --> 01:42:07.780]   I ran into Michael Oland.
[01:42:07.780 --> 01:42:08.780]   I don't know if you know him.
[01:42:08.780 --> 01:42:09.780]   He's great.
[01:42:09.780 --> 01:42:10.780]   He did shooting raw.
[01:42:10.780 --> 01:42:11.780]   He did the new Lightroom book.
[01:42:11.780 --> 01:42:14.740]   I know you're an aperture guy, but he did that great Lightroom book.
[01:42:14.740 --> 01:42:17.460]   His Lightroom book, it was called Lightroom Adventure.
[01:42:17.460 --> 01:42:21.700]   And he took a bunch of pro-photographers, including Michael Reichman, to Iceland.
[01:42:21.700 --> 01:42:24.100]   They had all took photos, then worked with Lightroom.
[01:42:24.100 --> 01:42:26.180]   So it's got all these Lightroom recipes and these great photos.
[01:42:26.180 --> 01:42:27.980]   It's kind of the best of both worlds.
[01:42:27.980 --> 01:42:30.460]   Well his next one is to Tasmania.
[01:42:30.460 --> 01:42:32.340]   I guess who going?
[01:42:32.340 --> 01:42:35.540]   I'm going to be the media mascot.
[01:42:35.540 --> 01:42:42.100]   Because I am, you know, I mean, the photographers that are going on this are, you know, daunting.
[01:42:42.100 --> 01:42:46.140]   Just do me a favor and keep track of how many times the phrases they use go clean over
[01:42:46.140 --> 01:42:47.140]   your head.
[01:42:47.140 --> 01:42:48.140]   That's what I want.
[01:42:48.140 --> 01:42:49.340]   I'm thinking I'm going to come back.
[01:42:49.340 --> 01:42:50.420]   I'm going to learn a little bit.
[01:42:50.420 --> 01:42:52.220]   I'll know finally what Boca means.
[01:42:52.220 --> 01:42:53.780]   You know, I'm going to learn a little bit here.
[01:42:53.780 --> 01:42:54.780]   Good.
[01:42:54.780 --> 01:42:56.380]   I'm going to have you as a guest on this week.
[01:42:56.380 --> 01:42:59.020]   I'll talk about it on Twip.
[01:42:59.020 --> 01:43:00.820]   When is Twip online?
[01:43:00.820 --> 01:43:04.100]   It's, we're putting it into the feed this week.
[01:43:04.100 --> 01:43:08.700]   So it will find its way on and it really will be really, really online next week.
[01:43:08.700 --> 01:43:10.620]   I would love to be a guest on that show anytime, guys.
[01:43:10.620 --> 01:43:13.420]   And we do have a blog up already, TwipPhoto.com.
[01:43:13.420 --> 01:43:18.780]   TwipPhoto.com and look forward on Pixelcore.
[01:43:18.780 --> 01:43:20.780]   Is that where it will be?
[01:43:20.780 --> 01:43:22.780]   The video itself will be on Pixelcore.
[01:43:22.780 --> 01:43:24.780]   Oh, it's video.
[01:43:24.780 --> 01:43:25.780]   Oh, sorry.
[01:43:25.780 --> 01:43:26.780]   Video and audio.
[01:43:26.780 --> 01:43:28.900]   It's going to be a mixture of audio, video, screencast.
[01:43:28.900 --> 01:43:32.140]   We're going to kind of just mix it all up into one feed and let people get a little
[01:43:32.140 --> 01:43:33.140]   bit of everything.
[01:43:33.140 --> 01:43:34.140]   Cool.
[01:43:34.140 --> 01:43:35.140]   I will be on the audio once.
[01:43:35.140 --> 01:43:36.140]   I won't be on the video once.
[01:43:36.140 --> 01:43:37.140]   Right.
[01:43:37.140 --> 01:43:38.140]   Because I don't like to drive.
[01:43:38.140 --> 01:43:39.140]   I don't like to shave.
[01:43:39.140 --> 01:43:40.140]   I don't like to.
[01:43:40.140 --> 01:43:41.140]   That's why, yeah.
[01:43:41.140 --> 01:43:46.260]   You got what I call the trouser surcharge, which is, uh, if I give you a really screaming
[01:43:46.260 --> 01:43:48.220]   deal as long as I don't have to put pants on.
[01:43:48.220 --> 01:43:49.220]   No pants.
[01:43:49.220 --> 01:43:51.220]   As soon as I step into pants, it's going to cost you.

[01:45:49.900 --> 01:45:52.820]   Most people are not in San Francisco.
[01:45:52.820 --> 01:45:57.460]   That's what I, you know, that's what most of our members, which we like to call people.
[01:45:57.460 --> 01:45:58.660]   I'm sure that's correct.
[01:45:58.660 --> 01:46:01.380]   You should check those of us who count.

[01:46:11.700 --> 01:46:15.580]   I mean, we have ads in the, in the, in the shows, but I really want to thank CashFly.
[01:46:15.580 --> 01:46:19.420]   For last week, we hit them a little hard.
[01:46:19.420 --> 01:46:20.420]   What show was that?
[01:46:20.420 --> 01:46:21.420]   So Mac Break video.
[01:46:21.420 --> 01:46:22.420]   Oh, the Mac Break stuff.
[01:46:22.420 --> 01:46:28.260]   We did, we shot 30 episodes last week about Mac, Mac world.
[01:46:28.260 --> 01:46:31.300]   And I think it's some of the best coverage we've ever, it is the best coverage we've
[01:46:31.300 --> 01:46:32.900]   ever done of Mac world.
[01:46:32.900 --> 01:46:36.140]   And, and we kind of got the model working on how to produce lots of them.
[01:46:36.140 --> 01:46:37.140]   And so we did.
[01:46:37.140 --> 01:46:41.060]   And so what that, and I got, and then the problem is of course I didn't warn Matt that
[01:46:41.060 --> 01:46:42.060]   we were doing it.
[01:46:42.060 --> 01:46:45.180]   And so there were these emails from Matt going, like, so what's going on?
[01:46:45.180 --> 01:46:48.660]   And I got like 1.2 gigabits per second for the last four days, you know.
[01:46:48.660 --> 01:46:52.780]   So, so we're not being invited to the state 3.0 dinner, Alex.
[01:46:52.780 --> 01:46:54.540]   Oh, that's a good dinner.
[01:46:54.540 --> 01:46:55.940]   That's a podcast expo.
[01:46:55.940 --> 01:46:58.420]   We do thank Matt Levine, who's great and CashFly.
[01:46:58.420 --> 01:47:01.220]   They also provide the bandwidth for this show and many of the Twitt shows.
[01:47:01.220 --> 01:47:02.460]   So just great support.
[01:47:02.460 --> 01:47:03.460]   CashFly is the fan.
[01:47:03.460 --> 01:47:04.460]   Tastiscist.
